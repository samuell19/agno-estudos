I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare. Uh, that was a lie. I did mean to stare. Let's go, please. Because you're pretty, in a real nice way. Thanks. After the opening of my show, I went to Fantasia, the movie, and, uh, I ate some Raisinets and I started thinking about our last session together. And I found myself becoming a child again, like, before the age of reason, before the age of pubic hair. An innocent feeling. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. I haven't felt so pure since before I went to jail. Can I show and tell? All right, but don't be critical, because this is just a work in progress. My latest paint job. I call it Olivia's Travels III, the last of a trilogy. She looks like an angel. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what she is. We were at the Tavern on the Green to have lunch, like we do every Wednesday. God, that place, you know, with the big windows and the trees outside. You don't feel like you're in New York, you feel like you're in another world. An enchanted, mystical one. And, we fucked there. I mean, um. We fucked before they even sat us at our table. I'd just gone to the ladies' room and when I came out, he was waiting for me. With that look in his eye. And he started kissing me. and backed me into a maintenance room. And started taking off my clothes. I kept looking at the door, wondering if it would open. When we were naked, we got on the floor and started tasting each other. Oh, um. There's another moment I should mention. Before we actually began making love, he, um... He noticed these pipes running along the ceiling. He said that he wanted to tie my wrists to them and make love to me from behind. And I came when he said that. Spontaneously. He hadn't even touched me. I just. Closed my eyes and. Reached up on my toes. And it happened. Your cheeks are pink. Aren't I the one who should be blushing? I don't think I'm blushing, Eve, but it is a sexy story. You like my stories about him, don't you? Experiencing spontaneous orgasm following her lover's telling her he wanted to tie her wrists to overhead pipes and have intercourse with her in that position. This is the first time her explorations have extended into the bondage area. Patient also indicated she thought therapist may be responding to her sexual stories. Patient seemed pleased by this. I remember this patient I used to have. Well, he was gorgeous. He looked like Richard Gere and he would talk about his sexual explorations with his girlfriend. I mean, these people! They didn't eat, they didn't sleep, they didn't work. They just explored new ways to fuck. After his session, I wouldn't be worth a damn. Did you stop treating him? Hell, no. I just rescheduled him for the end of the day so I could run home and rape Leo. You did not. Sarah, I think this is more than just a patient's stories bothering me. Why don't you come over for dinner tonight. Talk to Leo. Yeah. Yeah, we used to have a little mutt when we lived on 14th Street. Do you remember that? Alby? What? The mutt was on 86th Street. No. Remember, we had a mutt on... When we had that little apartment on... Wasn't even an apartment... It was like a... 321 West 4th Street? No, no, no, you lived there alone. I didn't live there with you. We had the mutt when we had the... This man makes the best pot roast in the city of New York. Now, that I agree with. I'm having this recurring dream about her lover. It's happening more and more. Have you ever met him? No. So you really... You really couldn't be dreaming about him, could you? No, I guess not. What else is happening in your life? What about, uh... What about you and Paul? What's going on there? I'm so angry at him. You wanna talk about that? Paul and I haven't slept in the same bed for six months. He's drinking a lot. Nothing's right. It never has been. I don't... I just don't wanna be there anymore. So, what are you gonna do about this? I'm gonna confront him. Tonight. Goodbye. Thanks for dinner. See you tomorrow. You sure you don't want Leo to walk you home? No. Okay. I think you should call me over the weekend if it doesn't get better. It's a very difficult situation. Leo, you know the work we did together back at school? Yeah. We got into some areas I didn't really wanna explore at the time. The whole trust business with men and... Mm-hm. I think I'm ready to explore some of those things now. With you. Ann, that was seven years ago. You were a medical student and you got in trouble and I was your therapist. But, I mean, a lot of time has gone by now. We're friends. We're practically family. Leo, I don't wanna go see somebody else. All right. Give me a couple of days to think about it, okay? Okay. So where were you? I had a bite with Leo and Sarah. Thought you had a meeting. No, it was cancelled. I wish you'd called. 1900 was playing at the Village and I wanted to see it. I'm sorry. Paul. Can we talk? Sure, Ann, we can talk. Only, before you get started, I wanna tell you about a decision I've reached. I've decided to move back into my own apartment. Now, this decision has little to do with you. To use a clich√©, I just need my own space for a while. We can still see each other, of course. Thanks for the compliment the other day. It came at a really nice time. Excuse me. My name's Doug McDowell. You don't know me from Adam, but would you consider having a cup of coffee with me? Not now. Sometime, I mean. I could supply references. My sister will vouch for me anytime. Just coffee. You're not feeling verbal today? See, I had this shitty impulse the other day and it's just staying with me. Okay, let's talk about it. Well, you know the girl who has the sessions after me? Well, I saw her as I was leaving last week. and she. She dug deep inside of me. Haughty and pristine. That conceit. I mean, who the fuck does she think she is? Okay, first, let's change the day of your appointment. It also might be a good idea for us to see one another more than once a week. For a while. Okay. Okay. I... All I wanna do is just keep my head together and paint. Saying that patient whose sessions follow his own provoke fantasies of bondage, sexual subjugation, sadism. He hasn't talked about these things in a long time. Come in. No filtering of any kind. Just the first image or thought that comes to mind, okay? The dream. The one that keeps repeating? Um, just images, really. A bedroom. Soft light. Hands on skin. Other things. Sexy. You see faces in this dream? No. Not really. Are you the woman in the dream? Or is it this patient of yours, Eve? I think it's her. Could it possibly be that I'm attracted to her? I-I mean, she's very beautiful, I... Let's not jump to conclusions, all right? Just... Just keep exploring. I'm glad I'm here. Good. Now, let's go on. Hello? Hi. It's Doug McDowell. Hi, how are you? Fine. I'm still wondering about that coffee. When? How about now? Well, I'm in jeans. Well, that's okay. That's perfect. I got the perfect place. The food is great and the view is. The most spectacular in the world. The most spectacular in the world, huh? Absolutely just... Wow. I've never seen anything like this in my life. How long have you been doing this? Uh, since high school. I was in the Air Force. I've been in the charter business about four years. Wanna get something to eat? I don't want it to stop. Well, it won't. There's this great fish place in Nantucket. Do you like fish? Nantucket Island? Massachusetts? Yeah, it's only an hour. Clear night, no traffic. This is decadent. All right. Sure. Let's go eat fish in Nantucket. The marriage only lasted a year and a half. It wasn't terrific. I guess the good news is we had no kids. How about you? No. I've never been married. How come? I had medical school for four years. Then my residency. Internship, another four. Didn't leave a lot of time for a social life. Weren't we supposed to trade the best days of our lives? Yeah, but mine would all be one-track. It's all flying. Well, go ahead. Okay, best day of my life... The first time I did aerobatics. I did a loop, did a roll. in the front seat of a military trainer. Strapped me in. I remember thinking. it was just like grabbing God by the ears and giving him a big, wet kiss right in the middle of his forehead. I guess mine would have to be my tenth birthday. I went fishing with my father. And we just. sat in this little boat all day. Just talking. about everything. And fishing. Best day I ever had. He was a pilot. During the Korean War. I'd like to talk to him about that. He's dead. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It was a long time ago. Where are you from? Wisconsin. Whitewater, Wisconsin. Keokuk, Iowa. Born and raised. Midwesterners, the best people in the world. The very best. Let me get that door for you, huh? Thanks. I can call you tomorrow if you like. Okay. I had a great time. Good. Good night. Hey, Steve Canyon. What? You want a cup of coffee? I'm okay. You just may be the gentlest man I've ever met. May I get undressed? Why do you wanna do that? I wanna bare myself to you physically the way I've bared myself psychologically. The mind and body should never be kept so separate. Now, Eve, I... Please. I need to do this. I've never felt closer to another woman ever in my life. Not my mother. or my sister. Eve. Am I pretty? I think you know you are, Eve. I fantasized that I would masturbate in front of you. Oh, God. Don't ask me what I'm doing. Oh, God. We had a fight. A horrible, horrible fight. A physical fight? He started torturing me. Bringing me close and stopping, then bringing me close again. And then he stopped. and took his necktie and tied my hands together in front of me. He had a rope. which he'd strung over a rafter. And he put a chair under it and ordered me to stand on it. There was a noose in the rope. And, um. He, um. Told me to put my neck into it. While he took a Polaroid of me. And the flash blinded me but. when I could see again, he was behind me. Whispering in my ear. He told me that he owned me and that he could... He could kick the chair out from me and I would hang. And then. He. Knelt in front of me. And began to make love to me as I stood there. And I'd never come so hard in all my life. I just convulsed. It's okay. You told her that what they're doing is dangerous, right? Of course. But I also had this intuition today... What if it's all delusional? What, you mean if this lover of hers doesn't exist at all? Well, I realized her descriptions of him have changed over time. I took a look at my notes. There's all kinds of discrepancies. Well, discrepancies don't necessarily mean he doesn't exist. Maybe she changes him in her mind for fun. Maybe... Maybe he's a composite of several different men. Who knows? I'd love to go over there. She says she has lunch with him every Wednesday at Tavern on the Green. You can't spy on her. What are you talking about? I know. Come on. Let's talk about you. I met a guy. A very gentle, wonderful guy. I invited him in and I slept with him. You feel okay about it? Actually, I feel very okay. He's not the intellectual type. He's sort of a man's man. He flies planes for a living. I just felt real secure with this guy. You trusted him? He felt familiar. Familiar. And he's a pilot. I think I know what you're getting at. But, yeah, actually there, are a lot of things about him that remind me of my father. I sound like one big clich√©. Well, a clich√© is one thing you've never been. I think this guy could be really good for me. Really good. Ann, it's Doug. I, uh, just wanted to tell you how much I loved my first visit to Carnegie Hall the other night. I really did have a good time. And I, uh... I just... I can't seem to stop thinking about you. God, I hope that doesn't scare you. Uh, see you tomorrow night. You see something you like? Uh, yeah, can I see these here? Today's Wednesday, isn't it? Yep. Wednesday. Would you go through the park, please, and drop me off at Tavern on the Green? Be right back. Ann! What's going on? Hi, it's Ann. Please leave a message, thanks. Ann, it's Doug. What was that all about today? If it was that girl, she's just an old friend. I dated her a long time ago and we ran into one another and decided to have lunch. Ann, I'm really concerned. Will you give me a call, please? I don't know. He's gone. For good. He's probably on to some other cunt. I don't know, he didn't have the balls to tell me. Eve, you've never mentioned his name. Francis Douglas McDowell. Heartless cocksucker. Where did you meet him? The tranquilizers you're giving me are not doing a thing. Can you give me something stronger, please? I'll prescribe something before you leave. Great. Thank you. Eve, there's an issue I wanna open. Lately, I've been wondering if we've been making as much progress as we should be. You're jilting me too. I wouldn't characterize this as jilting you. I simply think it's time for us to evaluate our work together. Can you excuse me just one minute? I'm... I've gotta make a call. I'll be right back. Leo, it's me. I need to talk to you. It's an emergency. Oh, Leo. Ann, listen to me, please. I don't know what's going on here. Haven't you gotten any of the messages I left on your machine? Will you stop, please, and listen to me, damn it? I was merely having lunch with a woman. Hey. Hey! What, did you go find him when my stories made you hot? I left without my prescription. I need it. Eve, we met by coincidence. It's imperative that you know that. My shrink has been sleeping with my man. I mean, I know, I know, I'm prettier than her. I can't believe that she fucks better. They've been fucking. My psychiatrist has been fucking my boyfriend. Eve, let me... Shut up. I took some file folders from your office today. so that you wouldn't toss me. They had some, um, tapes in them. What tapes. Now I'm gonna hurt you with them. I should have put a knife into you a long time ago. Get the fuck out of my way. I swear to you, I had no idea. Right. She came back and they were gone. Yeah. How many are missing? Eight folders. Her own and seven others. Any one of those patients could sue you blind. I'm-I'm worried about her. What you should be worried about is yourself. And your other patients. "Hello, Mrs. Smith. I'm reading about "your husband's pedophilic fantasies. Did you know he had those?" I think she could do something really self-destructive. I'm gonna call her. We gotta think about you for a minute. Sit down here. Take a seat. I talked to Arnie. Oh, good. What'd he say? Arnie Levin is probably the best malpractice attorney in the city. I told him exactly what happened. First of all, you should not contact her personally. You should have an attorney do it after she's had a chance to cool down. He'll do it, if we want him to. You know, this whole episode wasn't a coincidence. You bet it wasn't. This McDowell, he had to know that she was seeing you. I think he, he tracked you down and he bedded you... And then he made goddamn sure that she found out about it. I don't think so. Ann, what are the odds, the numerical odds, of this man running into you, purely by chance, in this city? Son of a bitch. I think I was falling in love with him. What, you got the locks changed already? Paul, you're drunk. Well, I haven't been able to get you on the phone. Now, don't you think there may be just a few things to be said? Paul, something happened today. I don't wanna talk right now. I'll call you next week. Where is she, Billy? There's an apartment in the back. She's in there. All right, fellas, come on, give them some room. Looks like suicide at this point. I understand that you were her psychiatrist. Yes. You found the body? I got here about 10 and the door was open. I came in. Where's your office? Five Hundred, Fifth Avenue. Do you usually make house calls? No. She was under a lot of stress lately and I couldn't get her on the phone. Stress? What kind of stress? I can't disclose that. Right. Right. Doctor-patient confidentiality and all of that. How long you been treating her? Three and a half months. How many times a week? Twice. Let's see. If there's four weeks in a month, that's $300 per week... That's about 4 grand, I would think. Jeez, all that money changing hands and you couldn't even save her from killing herself. Do you want anything else from me? I guess we got your home number and all. You can go. Leo, I should have done something. I should have knocked on her door. I should have evaluated her and put her in a hospital. Yeah, but you didn't have that choice, did you? Yes, I did. The relationship between you two had been terminated. You'd slept with the same man. Leo, that should not have stopped me from going down there and helping her! Are you angry with me about the advice I gave you last night? Leo, she was my patient. You weren't the one treating her and I should have gone with my own instincts. Hello? Dr. Hecker, Larry Morgenstern. Yeah, I just came from the pathologist's office. You know what he said to me? He took one look at Ms. Abergray's body and said... "Jeez, Larry, you must be blind. "This girl's got a hell of a fracture "at the base of her skull. Rope didn't do this." So, what do you know, Ann? She was murdered. Think you can come down to the station house tomorrow, pay us a visit? Did she have any enemies that you know of? No. Kinky sex? The question of kinky sex. Did she ever play with any ropes or anything with her lover? Lieutenant, I'm not gonna feel comfortable answering any of these questions. Well, shit, I don't get it. How can you be so protective of your patient's confidentiality when the poor girl is dead? Do you know who she dated? Look, if you feel uncomfortable talking to me about this, why don't you just give me your session notes. How do you know about my session notes? Working-class stiff that I am? Before I was a cop. I went to City College as a psych major. I can't give you my notes. I bet I could subpoena them. I don't think so. I can't give you any more than I already have. Okay. I guess you can go. Doctor. You're very pretty for a shrink. Wait a minute. I'll walk you out. You've been very cooperative. If we need any more info, we'll be in touch. Okay. Oh, hey, Billy-O. Doc, I want you to meet my partner, Billy O'Meara. Billy, this is Dr. Hecker. Pleased, I'm sure. And this is, uh, Doug. McDowell. Right. Dr. Hecker was Eve's psychiatrist, Doug. Doug here dated Eve several times. Maybe you heard about him in one of your sessions. Well, unless Billy-O's got any more questions for you, you can go. No, fine. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Nice meeting you. Excuse me! Doug, Ann. I know the two of you had a relationship. I talked to a bunch of people who saw the fireworks in the lobby the other night. Call us if you have any additional information, okay? Taxi! Why did we do that? I don't know. We certainly don't have anything to hide. She told me a story involving you, sexual games with a rope. Is that why they asked me my whereabouts on the night of the murder? I didn't tell them. I'm asking you. Why don't you just ask me if I killed her. I thought I was the gentlest man you ever met. Good morning, doctor. I've come for my weekly session. Why do you have such hostility toward psychiatry? My mother. Of course. Truly. She always wanted me to be a shrink. She still introduces me as her son, the psychiatrist. The day she learned I became a cop, she almost killed herself. She thinks it's low, working-class, un-Jewish. The cruel truth, doc? I don't think my mother loves me anymore. You're supposed to ask me how I feel about that. How do you feel about it? Here's how I feel, fuck her. Got a wife now, I don't need a mother. So. F.D. McDowell. Boy, his alibi sure does suck. He said he went flying in his jet plane, wanted to be alone and think. No flight plan, though. Nobody saw him take off. What could possibly have been his motive? Eve threatened to kill him in the lobby there. Or maybe it was just a question of kinky sex. Or maybe he did it to protect you. From what? Well, I know that Eve lifted a bunch of your tapes with your session notes on them. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Doctor, the intimacies of the therapeutic process getting out, that could really fuck up a career, couldn't it? I got them, by the way. Your tapes. Found them in a hatbox in the closet. Yeah. Those tapes are my property. I'd like them back. No. Material evidence in a murder investigation. Look, I know they're important to you. Maybe we could hammer something out. Maybe you come down to the station around 3, we could talk about it then. Look, I'm getting tired of your games. I know. But I got your tapes. Is 3 a good time for you? It's good work, doc. Complete, detailed. It's a damn good listen. Better than a Jackie Collins novel. The part where she said that, uh he wanted to tie her wrists to the pipes so he could nail her from behind, I got an erection. I'm really happy for you. Can I have the rest of my tapes now? This is a promotional mailer from Eve Abergray's gallery. A reproduction of a work called Olivia's Travels I. I'm sure you'd be familiar with the artist's hand. Not your usual neurotic housewife, is he? You know what I think? I think that John Boy is the other party in Eve's story about the rope and the chair. I think they dated. I think they horsed around with that mondo-bondo shit and then I think at some point John lost it. He lost it and he hit her in the back of the head with a blunt object, then he hung her up and he got off on it. Now, John's tapes weren't amongst the ones that Eve lifted. I want a copy. You know I can't do that. How much of this animal's history do you even know? I'm his psychiatrist, lieutenant. What do you think? I think you don't know shit. Now, I want you to sit here. and watch one of my therapy sessions. You might learn something. How does it feel? Eh, Johnny? Eh, John Boy? How's it feel? How does what feel? Oh, I don't know. Going from an 8 by 10 cell at Greenhaven to becoming the darling of the New York art world in two short years. Feels like I wanna talk to my attorney. That's what it fucking feels like. Sit down. You wanna talk to your attorney? Can I get a cigarette? Cindy Ballard... Pay attention! Cindy Ballard didn't have an attorney the night you picked her up and took her to that railroad shack in Nyack, did she? I wasn't charged with that. No shit. She was too scared to testify against you, you little cocksucker. Cindy Ballard, after the fact. Any of your little art groupies ever ask you to tie them up, John? Who the fuck are you talking to back there, man? Come on, you know you'd like that. You don't even have to touch yourself, do you? Just the sight of them struggling, spontaneous emission right in your fucking blue jeans. Nancy Goldberg, after the fact. Psychotherapy helping you overcome any of these dark impulses, John Boy? Who the fuck are you talking to back there? You tied her hands so tight behind her back she almost lost one of them. What was your instrument of fun with her? What did you torture her with, cigarettes? You used a whole pack on her, didn't you? I wasn't charged with that. Karen McNarry, after the fact. It's too bad that you didn't have therapy before you met her. Isn't it, John? You had a lot of inspiration with her, didn't you? Oh, yeah. You had the inspiration to use these fucking things on her, didn't you? Huh? I wonder if she's in therapy now. What do you think? You think she's seeing a plastic surgeon? I wasn't charged with that crime. You see these? You see these? He used these on a woman's breasts. Breasts that are supposed to nurture an infant. Who the fuck are you talking to back there? Please. Beneath the bullshit, I am an earnest man. I think this asshole has finally killed somebody and I want your help in confirming it. Get this animal out of here! This asshole is way outside the purview of his authority. He's violating every law there is. Well, he thinks he is the law. Well, there's a whole criminal justice system that wouldn't agree with him. I'm gonna call Arnie Levin. Leo, don't. I think it's over, anyway. Why, what do you...? You think that this, uh... This artist of yours, you think he really killed her? If you had asked me this morning, I would've said absolutely not. But I was only aware of one incident. Apparently, there were others. A lot of them. I'm feeling pretty gullible right now. I feel really stupid. Oh, come on. A bright psychopath can fool anybody. I just got off the phone with Chris at Burkdale. He told me that Paul checked himself in last week. Aside from the alcohol, he'd been self-medicating with Ritalin and amphetamines for the last few months. I miss Doug. Ann. Sarah, why do you feel so strongly about him? Hasn't his behavior been a little strange? Don't you think? Well, what was all that skulking around your building when you first met, what was that about? I don't know. I need to ask you something. I need to ask you what you were doing in my building those times we met in the elevator. I was at the Armolyn Corporation on the 22nd floor. I fly their executives. Eve told me you had lunch with her every Wednesday at Tavern on the Green. You know what? I'm not gonna answer any more of this crap. I shouldn't have to. Look, I'm sorry. You're right. I guess in your world everybody has some deep, dark, hidden side. I hate to disappoint you, Ann, I just don't have one. Now, why you helping him frame me? I'm not. I don't believe you. I'm not. No, no. Don't. Don't. Don't. No. Okay, I just want you to imagine that, That you're this little girl on another planet. And you were born there and that's all you know. And nobody makes love there because there's a law against the love act. But it's okay with you because you're just a kid. But then one day pubic hair starts to grow and you got new instincts. And you wanna go against the law and you wanna fuck. Could you stay inside the laws of this planet, Dr. Hecker? Could you stay inside of them for every minute of every hour of every day until the day you die? No. Well, nature played a real shit trick on me. I got these instincts inside of me that are real different than the usual ones on this planet. When I see a pretty woman. I don't wanna fuck. This is... I wanna hear the sounds that she makes when she's in her pain. Don't you feel the heat? Do you feel it? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right, show and tell. Another paint job. Olivia's Travels II. I've never showed this to anybody before. See, we were winning the fucking war. You were teaching me to put the poison inside of there instead of outside on the streets. I didn't kill her. I just went to lunch with her a few times and she talked me into doing a show in her gallery. And, okay, I fantasized about her, but that's as far as I went. Because if I really killed her. I don't think I'd be able to leave you here tonight. John! John! John. Come back inside. Call him on the phone. Call him on the phone and get him over here now. Just call Morgenstern. Come on, do it. Do it now, all right? Get him on the phone and get him over here. I was with this street artist on the night that she was killed. This guy named Karsch and... And he came to my place to see some stupid shit I was working on. And we just stayed till dawn, just talking and drinking, you know? Has Morgenstern talked to this Karsch? He can't find him. Because he's a crackhead, that's why. Okay, Johnny, come on in. We'll talk to Morgenstern when he gets here. We'll tell him about Karsch. We'll find Karsch. Could you get me a blanket or something? I'm cold. Hey, lieutenant. Hey, how you doing? Hey, guys. Hey, Joe. Just be careful with him. Come on. He wants to talk to me. Hello, John Boy. I hope you don't think this little crow's act you're doing here is gonna make me think you're innocent. Go ahead. Tell him what you think. Tell him that you don't think I killed her. Go ahead, doc. This is an open forum. He didn't do it. He was with somebody named Karsch... Yeah. Did you check it? What, Frank Karsch? The famous phantom Frank Karsch? What even makes you think there is a Frank Karsch? Look, I've had enough of this bullshit. Get in here. I wanna go home. You know I didn't do it, motherfucker. You know, I did a nasty, naughty thing tonight, John Boy. I let myself into your loft. I took a look at some of your artwork, you sick fuck. Eve in Bondo. You know, you really should've gotten rid of this. Come on, it's just a drawing, man. What the fuck does that mean, huh? You know, you got her tits right. You know why you got her tits right? Because you saw them on the night that you killed her, you little cocksucker! That's enough! I just drew a lot of shit from my imagination, motherfucker. You little bastard! Don't! Sit down! I draw shit from my imagination. You're trying to put me away for a lot of shit I didn't do! I wanna do it. John. I wanna do it. John, don't. We'll find Karsch. I'll help you find him. John, listen to me! Come inside. Come in. Okay. No! Out of the way! Grab my wrist. Grab my wrist, goddamn it. Do it. Come on, do it! Grab it. I'm not gonna drop you. Get some help in there, come on! Come on! I think Morgenstern may have dropped him on purpose. Well, maybe he did, maybe he didn't. We don't really know that. You know. I can remember another night just like this. I got called to one of the dorms because a student. had just received word that her father had died. When I got there. I saw this young woman sitting alone in a dark room. The only light coming from a candle by the window. She literally couldn't move, couldn't speak. I'm just concerned that. all these things that happened tonight are. maybe, you know. taking you back to all kinds of things. I'm okay. Why don't you spend the night in the guest room. Can't sleep? Took some Ativan. It's not helping. You know, he was never right. after my mother died. One night during a spring break I found him sitting in the rec room, alone. In the dark. "Are you okay, Dad?" He said he was fine. Then he asked me about medical school and, was I lonely living so far away from home. And I knew there was something wrong, but I went back to school. And a week later, my sister Renee called and, And said that he'd gathered everybody around him in the kitchen and talked to them for a while. And then shot himself in the head. He was my best friend. He just left. And I miss him. I miss him so much. But I'm real pissed off. Because life is hard enough without what he did to me. You know, in all the time we've worked together. that's the first time I've heard you express anger at your father. I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep now. I heard what happened. Are you all right? Yeah. The man who fell, did he have something to do with Eve? Morgenstern thinks he killed her. Then it's over. Thank God. It's been a nightmare. I'm heading for Iowa tonight, visit my mother for the weekend. You wanna go flying? Hi, Mom. Hi. Come meet my mom. Dr. Ann Hecker. Welcome. Hi, Mrs. McDowell. How are you? Hi, dear. It's a pleasure to meet you. Honey. Either of you want another cup? No, thank you, Lorraine. I think Ann's a little tired, Mom. It's an hour later, New York time. Of course. Let me show you your rooms. Two of them. She's a little old-fashioned. She's great. McDowell's special insomnia cure. To make sure you get some rest. Thank you. If you're lonely, I'm right down the hall. So's your mother. Good night. It's a really good feeling when a patient begins to make progress. As I grow older, I realize how many people are living quietly in pain. Sleep good? Yeah. I wanna take Ann on a little tour of Keokuk. Well, that's fine. I gotta check the DME in the plane anyway. When you figure you'll be back? Twelve or so. I'll meet you back here. And that's our courthouse and jail. And over there is the church Doug went to when he was growing up. Baptized there and went to school there. Married there. All of it. Has his ex-wife ever remarried? Jenny's dead. When did she die? Christmas morning, 1987. She hung herself. Jenny was young and delicate. High-strung. I was a different guy back then. I was in the service flying F-16s, I was away from home a lot. Just having a great time. Also having an affair. Jenny found out, she just freaked. She attacked me physically a couple times. One time she came at me with a knife. I took it away from her. In the process, I hit her. After that she just sank into this deep, dark funk. Holidays came, it got worse. I came home from a flight one Christmas morning. there she was. Why didn't you tell me about it? The coincidence of two women being found dead. Both by hanging. It's about all Morgenstern would have needed. Why didn't you tell me? Your trust quotient wasn't very high back then, you remember? Did you tell Eve about Jenny? I believe him. You choose to believe him. Two women he's with, both found dead by the same means. That's just coincidence? No, it's not coincidence. He told Eve about his wife's suicide. I-I think that's how her whole fascination with the ropes and the bondage stuff began. She fantasized about it at first, then she met John Castillo and it became real. Leo. She was my patient. I know how her mind worked. This makes sense, it really does. Don't you think you ought to tell Morgenstern about this? No, I don't. Why are you exposing yourself to danger like this? This is dangerous. Leo. I'm in love with him. I have to believe him. This is McDowell Aviation. Please leave a message after the beep. It's me. If you're flying, call me when you get in. I'm at the office. I'll be home in a little while. Bye. We've missed our weekly session. I need to see you. Why? I'm in extremis. I need your help. Where are you? Welcome to my office. Come in. You want a drink? No, thank you. You know, I lied to you. I've never been married. I don't have a wife. Is that what you called me down here for? John Boy's alibi came through. Frank Karsch walked into my office Friday night. So, what do you know? The little cocksucker didn't do it after all. I'm a good cop. A good man. You think if I'd known he was innocent, I could've held on a little longer? Well, I have to live with that. I have to live with that. Since you're a professional in the field of mental health, perhaps you could suggest how I should deal with it. Maybe I should get therapy? What is your relationship with Leo and Sarah Green? Are you friends? Yes. One of them ever treat you as a patient? Yes, Leo did. Why? Doesn't matter. You know, I been, I been talking to cops all day. Cops in Iowa. Did you know your boyfriend beat up his wife back there? Yeah. You know, they questioned him about her suicide. He probably killed her, yeah. Like he probably fucking killed Eve, like he would've killed you, you stupid little shit. He did not! Go ahead. Go get yourself killed. Ann. You told him, didn't you? You went to Morgenstern and you told him. Arnold Levin told me that if Doug turns out to be guilty, you would become an accomplice and you'd probably be prosecuted. I called Morgenstern as your proxy. He came here and I told him what you found out in Iowa. You betrayed me. Jesus Christ, Ann! He did this to protect you. I trusted you, Leo. How dare you. How dare you talk about trust and betrayal! You owe Leo your life! Good night, Sarah. Hi, it's Ann. Please leave a message. Thanks. It's Doug. It's me. Are you okay? Morgenstern questioned me for about three hours in his car. I was handcuffed. He smacked me around a little bit. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Where are you? I just set down in Harrisburg. I just needed to be alone a minute, clear my head. You told him about Jenny, didn't you? No, I didn't. I told Leo. He took it upon himself to call Morgenstern... You aren't lying to me now, are you? No, I am not. Doug, please, just come home. Will you meet me at Teterboro? Okay. All right. If you leave there now you ought to get to the airport about the same time I do. Okay. See you soon. Ann? Hi. Paul, I can't. I can't. Listen, listen. I wanted to... Ann? Just for a sec. Not now. Ann. Would you open the door? Paul. Ann, why won't you talk to me? Stop it! What the hell is the matter with you? Ann? What the hell...?! Doug? Doug? Doug? He was like that when I walked in. Ann! Oh, what the fuck? Come here! Goddamn it, what is wrong with you? No, she's fine. We all are. Just a nice, relaxing time. Yeah, surprisingly gorgeous here. Okay, Arnie, I'll... Yeah, well, let me ask Sarah. If we're free, we'd love to. That would be great. Okay, bye-bye. That was Arnie Levin. He wants us to have dinner with his new lady friend Tuesday. Please. Where's Ann? She's in there. I just talked to Arnie Levin. He says McDowell is off the critical list and he'll probably be indicted by the end of the month. Isn't there some Vivaldi around here? Yeah, it's in that cabinet over there. On the left-hand side. I'm hungry. Lunch is ready. I'm coming. Did you get the bread? Yeah. You decent? I'm in the tub. Sarah and I are going into town to get some tapes. You got any suggestions? Um, how about Lawrence of Arabia? Good, good. And get some popcorn. All right, we'll get you popcorn. See you soon. She talked about her home in Ohio today, about her early youth and her relationship with her father. She's so innocent, really. And yet she's as bright as a whip. She really laughed for the first time today. Then she kind of looked embarrassed, as though therapy had to be, a heavy, laborious process. I set her straight on that one. The whole session was lively today. She's beginning to understand the way it all works. She's contributing. I'm facing a kind of a crisis. I'm beginning to feel real affection toward her. I gotta watch it here. I may be getting a bit too emotionally involved. She walked into my office today and she was. She was just radiant. The floor just dropped out from under me. Her eyes. Her eyes are like, Like sunlight. I'm falling in love with her. End, patient 347, session 204. I'm completely head over heels. Nothing I can do. I don't feel guilt. I feel nothing but complete, undiluted love. Sarah has no idea what I've gotten myself into. Ann needs me to protect her. She doesn't have anyone else. She never did. Oh, Ann, Ann, Ann. You're never out of my thoughts. In the 25 years Sarah and I have been together I've never felt one-tenth the emotion I feel for this beautiful young woman. That idiot medical student she's been seeing, she needs his support now. He's pulling away. Goddamn him. I'd like to smash his head in. Hi, we're back. I'll be in there in a second. Ann? We got Lawrence for you. Oh, Leo. You practically finished the first bottle yourself. You're not gonna be able to stand up. You're so quiet tonight. I'm just a little worried. My sister Renee called and... She said Michael left her again. Oh. She wanted me to go, fly to Toledo tomorrow. I said I couldn't, but I'm feeling a little guilty about it. I suppose if I got a late flight out of here tonight, I, I can catch an early flight out of JFK tomorrow. Well, I'd be happy to run you over to the airport, if you decide to go. I think maybe I will. You know, I didn't intend to kill Eve when I went over there. What did you say? I just went to get your tapes back. What in God's name are you saying? Sit down. Sit down. Please, sit. So I told her I understood and I got up to go. She stopped me as I was leaving and she started saying, these really ugly things about you. About how you and she had had a full-blown sexual affair. When she tried to break it off, you got even by, by fucking her man. Can you...? Can you imagine that? And then I looked for your tapes. I couldn't find them anywhere. She had hidden them someplace, that sick fucking bitch! I'm sorry. I'm a little upset. I'll clean this up. You know, Morgenstern was... He was very intelligent. He was very friendly when he came over. He even stayed for coffee. after I told him what you found out in Iowa. He pretended to be interested in the way Sarah decorated the apartment, but his, his mind was really on other things. Finally, he thanked me and he left. But he called me again right after he questioned your lover. I think he'd decided that McDowell was probably innocent. He asked me a lot of very strange questions like what were my personal feelings toward you and had I ever met Eve. I think, I think he'd sensed that, I think he'd sensed the depth of my affection for you. So I called him later that night. "Lieutenant, I'm over here at McDowell Aviation. You gotta come out here right away." "Hey, I'm in bed. Why can't you tell me over the phone?" I think he'd been drinking. "Well, I can't tell you over the phone. "You gotta come out here now. It's urgent." He came. You know that ice pick with the silver handle? The one Sarah picked up on our trip to Aruba? I had it in a little brown paper bag. So he couldn't see it. But I had it in my hand. "Hey, lieutenant. Over here." He walked right up to me. Why are you crying? I'm afraid of you right now. You're afraid of me? That really hurts. After everything I've done for you, how can you say you're afraid of me? That's unacceptable. That is un-fucking-acceptable! All right, let's calm down. We're both a little upset, all right? I'm sorry. You've gotta understand something. For you to, For you to say you're afraid of me, after everything we've been through, I mean, you gotta realize that, I'm liable to interpret that as a kind of betrayal. I mean, what do you want from me? What do you want? You got me! You've got me! What do you want? You can't just throw me away like that, goddamn you! You can't throw me away, fucking bitch! Help! Oh! Goddamn you, bitch! Help! Help! Congratulations. How did it feel? Fine. "Fine." You're supposed to be terrified on your first solo. No problems? Not a single one? Being solo up there doesn't bother me. Yeah? Being solo down here does.
