RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Come December, I want Christmas for all the senses. Food, decor, carols, feelings... - The scent. - Yes! Fragrant pine meets fresh-baked gingerbread. Exactly, but how to get that without a fresh-cut fir, or pricey candles, or hours spent baking? Well, I have a little hack that takes only two minutes, and uses common household items. I love it, but hold that thought. For those of you just joining us, today we have a special guest, the co-founder of Cranberry Lane, Queen of Christmas, Dawn Powell! Pamela, you are the Queen of Christmas. I am merely your biggest fan. So you co-founded and run your lifestyle brand, cooking, baking, DIY-ing, Christmas-ing company Cranberry Lane with your husband, Gabe. So why isn't he here today? I know. I miss him, too, but he was needed back at the cranberry farm. Should we get started crafting? Always. Now, before we get started, I have a little holiday PSA. So when Christmas rolls around, we want everything to be perfect, right? The food, decorations, gifts... The people... But at Cranberry Lane, we like to say it's not about being perfect, it's about being perfectly you. Let's gather our supplies. So we're gonna need a clear glass ornament, - essential oils, spices... - Gabe? ...cloves, cinnamon, and of course... Yup! Good morning. Mornin', dad! Thank you so much for helping me with the stacking. My pleasure. Although, when I passed the farm on to you, I didn't expect to become your farmhand. Well, I already gave the crew time off for the holidays, and I only ask you 'cause I know you miss it. Oh, yeah, you're really doing me a big favor. Dawn, you did great. The camera loves you, and so will our viewers. Thank you. I hope so. So any big holiday plans? Yes, actually, I'm headed home to spearhead my town's cranberry Christmas festival which starts in four days. You know, tree-lighting, cookie bake-off, food, crafts, Santa's village, a dance. This is the festival where Cranberry Lane began, right? Yeah. Gabe and I started it 10 years ago with an ornament booth, and that booth has grown into all of this. And congratulations on that. I'm needed in editing, but it was so nice to meet you, and merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. If you find yourself in the nether regions of rural Maine next week, you should stop by the festival. Were you watching Dawn on Pamela Frank's show when I came in? Was Dawn on TV today? Well... She comes home this afternoon, right? How are you feeling about that? Actually trying not to feel. Thinking about becoming the strong, silent type. Good luck with that. Really, how are you doing? I don't know. It's hard. It's just... I feel like we both want different things. I want this Cranberry Lane, and... She wants that one. But you also want each other. Yeah... But how do we make that work? Because me here, and her on the road constantly isn't working. Well, have these three months apart given you any clarity? Honestly, I think they've only just created more distance. Well, distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? With Dawn coming home, we'll find out what proximity does. - Hi! - Hi! You're finally here! Come in, it's freezing. It is, it is. Hi! Hi! Alice, come here! Your aunt Dawn is here! Here you go. - Your house looks great. - Thank you. Hey, thank you again for letting me stay with you guys. No thank you necessary. You are my sister and my best friend. You are going to take over the cooking and cleaning, though, right? As expected. Yes... Hi, aunt Dawn! Look at you! - Guess what? - What! Mommy baked Christmas cookies! Oh, no. Yes? They're from the recipe you posted on the blog yesterday. Well, they look pretty. They're... They're... They're interesting. What's that mean? It means they're bad, and aunt Dawn is trying to be polite. Sorry. Go get the supplies. We're going to make the Christmas tree on the fridge. So... How are you? Good. What's new? Nothin'. How was your date last night? - I didn't go. - What? You promised you weren't going to cancel this one. I put the dress on this time. Enough of about me. How are you? Well, I feel like I have been gone for an entire year, so... I'm really happy to be home. Are you? Yes. Why wouldn't I be? Well, being away makes it easier to avoid things, or people. Oh, you are so right. I mean, it is one thing for me to smile at the camera, and tell everyone that Gabe and I are still the blissfully-wedded Cranberry Lane co-founders. And it is another thing to be home, and wonder what we really are, what we're going to be. It's going to be okay. Come. Come on, come on! Good job! That's so good! Here, for the top. And... Voilà. There's a candy cane in my jacket pocket waiting for you. Thank you! I don't know how you do it, but I do know why you do it. Dawn, stop avoiding. Go see Gabe. No, we are supposed to be giving each other space, and just trying to get through the holidays. But I do need to go to the house to get some clothes, and I think he's probably headed to his parents' house because it's Sunday, so... I'm gonna go do that. Good job not avoiding. Right. - Hey. - Hi! - I was... - Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you were at your parents', and your... Your truck wasn't outside, so... Well, it's your house, too. Yeah, I just, I loaned my truck to my parents so they could pick up the Christmas tree. They canceled Sunday dinner, 'cause, you know, mom's baking for the festival. The house looks amazing. It misses your artist's eye. No, it doesn't miss me at all. What is it? Nothing. - Listen, I need to... - So I need... You go ahead. I just need to grab some clothes. - Yeah, go ahead. - That's why I'm... Are you sure you got everything you need? Yeah, I think I do... For now. All right. Thanks. Hey, Dawn? Yeah? What was it? What was what? There was something you were gonna say... About the decorations. What was it? You didn't hang any mistletoe. Making the little bunches was always your job. Welcome back. Mary! Shelton! Dawn! We've missed you. I have missed you, too. Aw, honey, we know this has been a tough time, but also we know it's gonna work out. Remember, you've always been like a daughter to us, and you'll always be family. Thank you. I really appreciate that. Now, let me show you where your bakery booth is gonna be this year. - Okay. - This way! Grandma! Hi! I missed you so much! Me too! The festival doesn't start for three days. You already set everything up! I got excited. I think this year is a collection of my best pieces yet. They're absolutely gorgeous. Has anybody told you recently how talented you are? Of course, but I never tire of hearing it, so go on. You are so talented. So, honey, how is it, seeing Gabe? It was incredibly confusing. But it's okay. We're just gonna try and keep our... Distance. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. You seem surprised to see me. You seem surprised to see me. Well, the festival was always more my thing, so I just assumed that I would be taking over all the planning this year. And I assumed that you'd be swamped with work and travel, so I would take over the planning this year. That's sweet, thank you, but aren't you busy with the farm? Aren't you busy with Cranberry Lane? - Well, here we are. - Yup. Okay, so, little miscommunication. - Yeah. - That's okay. No problem. We're just gonna have to... - Work together... - Work toge... Yep. Okay, let's round up the volunteers. Yeah. Let's gather them up. Volunteers! So, thank you guys again for all of your help, and for being here. Yes, seriously, we could not have done any of this without you. - So thank you. - No. Any questions? - Great, let's get to it... - All right, let's... yes! - Yes. - Okay. All right. Susan, do you mind helping me? Thank you. So, are you guys still running this together? Of course we are. Why wouldn't we be? So, decorations... Everything has to be decorated. The vendors, the food area, Santa's village... Which will be a big one... But first, this big, glorious tree. Oh, no. What? They're broken! Open the other one. - This one, too. - What? There's not much left to work with. What happened? Can we use Cranberry Lane ornaments? Well, yeah, of course, but I just can't replace these. The town has been collecting them for decades. They have memories and stories... What other options do we have? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'll call the Texas factory, and have them overnight us some. That's my phone. Thanks, Susan. Of course. Hello? Dawn? It's Pamela Franks. Hi! Hi! So, Dawn, I know this might seem last minute, but I checked out your festival online, and it is so cute. Thank you. So I have my holiday special, an hour-long show every day until Christmas, and I was wondering, what if we showcased segments of your festival on my show? I'm in New York on-set, but I could send a skeleton crew to Bristol. Just a couple of days for shooting, a couple of five-minute spots? That would be amazing. Thank you. Perfect! So we'll showcase you, Gabe, and the farm. Then the two of you prepping the festival while preparing for your perfect Christmas together. Right... Well, I don't know if that part will be possible. Yeah, it's just that Gabe is so busy on the farm, and I'm not sure of his schedule right now. I understand completely, and not to be pushy, like I've been known to be, but this would be huge for the festival and even bigger for Cranberry Lane. So do you want to at least ask him? Yup. I will do that. Thanks, Pamela. - Hey. - Hey. Wait, where's the frozen hot chocolate booth? Sadly she can't do it this year. What? Yeah. No! Cancel the festival. I'm joking, but I'm sad. I know that you genuinely are. Hey, so a little something just came up. When you say "little," you usually mean big and complex. Just got off the phone with Pamela Franks. She wants to send a crew up here to cover the festival. That's great. Yes, but her angle is you and me, running the festival, and prepping for a perfect Christmas together. Yeah. She made it sound like it's just a couple days, and a couple of spots. I don't know, I think that maybe we could pull it off, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we could, but I feel like things are confusing enough between us right now, without adding cameras. Yeah... - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'll call her. Hey, you guys are still here? You know your mother and decorating. So, how did Dawn take the news? Well, she didn't take it because I have yet to give it. I know, I need to tell her, but now that we're doing the festival together, I don't want to make things any more difficult than they already are. Gabe, you have to tell her. I know. Hey, so, you wouldn't believe it, Pamela Franks called today, and she wants to cover the festival. No, Pamela Franks is coming here? Well, it's just gonna be a small crew, but... we actually decided against it. We thought it wouldn't be the best idea. What? Why? Because it would involve Dawn and I putting on the happy couple show. But, honey, you know, how much revenue the festival brings into Bristol, not just to the vendors, but, well, to the hotels, restaurants, shops, and imagine how Pamela could help that. And not just now, but for cranberry harvest season. We need tourists. You'll need tourists. Yeah, plus I'm sure that Pamela's show would be huge for Cranberry Lane, and... Dawn needs that, especially now. Well, now I feel terrible. Good, that was the point. - Hey. - Hey. Come in. Sorry. - Come in, come in. - Thank you. Uncle Gabe! What's up, Ali-bear? How you doing? - Hi. - Hi. What are you guys up to? Well, auntie Dawn and I are making advent calendars. Wanna help? We're actually heading off to bed. 'Night! 'Night! Hey. You want some hot chocolate? Homemade marshmallows. Ooh, you know me and your homemade marshmallows, but I, actually, I can't stay. I was just wondering, have you... have you talked to Pamela yet? No. I left her a message, and she hasn't called me back. Great. Then... I think we should do it. Seriously? Yeah. You know, I realized I think it would be really good for the town, and it would be big for Cranberry Lane. Yeah. Just a couple short spots. The crew is in and out, right? I mean, that's what it sounded like. I know it's not ideal... For us, but I was thinking the town has done so much for you and I. Maybe it's a little something we can do for them. A little something? No big deal, right? It's just a couple days of us being... Mr. and Mrs. Cranberry Lane. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Alice still sleeping? - Yeah. Did you stress-decorate? I also stress-responded to a hundred work emails, holiday promos, backed-up orders, machinery malfunctions. But on the plus side, I also stress-cooked. Have a cruller. Dawn... Yes? It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Besides, who knows where this might lead? Oh, I do. National television. Ooh... I've been wanting to tell you, I asked grandma to move in with Alice and me. You did? And let me guess, she didn't jump at the opportunity? No. I just worry about her living alone. What if something happened? So... Maybe you want to talk to her? I don't know, grandma is set in her ways. She just... She loves living alone, and being independent, and... Don't give me the eyes. When you give me the eyes, it's so hard to say no to you. Okay. All right. I'll try. Thank you. Good morning. Morning. I saw that the Miller's property is for sale. I didn't even know it was on the market. Yeah... Camera crew is here. Shall we? Let's do it. - Hi! - Hey, guys. - Welcome! - I'm Gabe. Hi, I'm Beth. Leroy. Thank you so much for having us. Hey, thank you guys for covering the festival. Should we head over there? Actually, Pamela wanted us to start the day here on the farm. - Great! - Great! Well, this property has been in my family for three generations, all of us cranberry farmers. Farming and this land is a big part of who we are. It's part of our heritage, our legacy. That's beautiful, but where are the cranberries? Good question. The plants are under that ice. The fruiting buds mature during the winter but are susceptible to severe weather, so we flood the bogs to protect the vines and the buds. Yeah, we actually just sanded, which we do every couple of years to encourage rooting. In winter, cranberry farming is mainly sanding, maintenance, and getting the equipment ready for the fall, but no matter the time of year, it's always busy. So how do you balance your time here with time at Cranberry Lane? Good question, we... Well, you know, for Gabe, the land has never felt like work. I mean, it's a lot of work, but it's also his passion. He's always been someone who loves to work with his hands and help things grow, and also, you know, Gabe has always had the heart of an artist, and I think this farm is his canvas. Thank you. Would you like to see anything else? Pamela wanted us to get some footage of your Christmas traditions. We could... We always cut down our... - Christmas tree. - Christmas tree... ...from the woods. Great. - Great. - Yeah. So, when did you two meet? Actually, our nap mats were next to each other in kindergarten, and then we were childhood best friends, and started dating in high school. We went to different colleges, did the long-distanced thing, and then we both came back here. And when did you get engaged? About 10 years ago. Yeah, it was after I inherited the farm, and right before we started the company. And what was the engagement like? Well, actually, Dawn was helping me down at the bogs, and we were making the way back to the house... And then all of a sudden, he just stopped on the back porch, and he had this... Look. Okay, I wasn't planning to propose right then, but I couldn't wait a minute longer. So he left me sitting in a rocking chair, and he ran off into the woods, and then he came back with a twig and a cranberry that he made into an engagement ring. Just twisted it around her finger. That's so romantic. But I'm sure the ring didn't last. Can we see the replacement? We actually never replaced it. We were... We were going to just design one together, and then we... We started the company, and we got married, and... We just got too busy. I think we found our tree. There. So do you decorate it now? No, typically, our tradition is to decorate with the whole family. Yeah. Pamela will love that. When is it? Tonight. Is it tonight? Yeah, I think it's best to do it tonight so Beth and Leroy don't have to stay longer for it. - Right. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's-that's-that's very true. It is tonight. - Yeah. - Yeah. Although we don't want to take away from you guys shooting festival prep? Yeah, we'll head there now and then come back here tonight. - Great! - Great! I'll call the family. Yeah. Right. Thank you for doing this. My pleasure. Lauren told me she asked you to move in with them. Then she probably also told you I said no. She did. Maybe reconsider? It could be fun. Yes, it would be fun to have more time with Lauren and Alice, but it'd turn me into an old biddy. I'll sit around and talk about the olden days and complain about the newfangled technology. Where's my phone? I want to get a video of you with the pizzas for my Instagram. Annual pal Christmas pizza time! Okay... come on in. Who's hungry? Me! So every year. You make new DIY ornaments? We use some Cranberry Lane, some DIY, but mostly, we use our parents' ornament collection. Our dad passed away six years ago, and our mom three years ago. Sorry to hear that. Thanks. Actually, making our own ornaments was our mom's tradition. And micromanaging the tree decorations was our dad's. Yeah, she just felt they were a fun way to give a tree a heartfelt, personalized touch. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Aunt Dawn? - Yeah. Remember how we put "slumber party under the Christmas tree" in our advent calendar for today? I do. Well, can we have our slumber party here? Of course you can, Ali-bear. - Really? - Really? Yeah. Hey... Hey. So... A little something. Thank you. Where did you find mistletoe? You know, I always keep an emergency stash. Of course. I'm sorry, I interrupted you. You were about to say something. Just... Sleep well. Yeah. Sleep well. Yeah. So the festival starts tomorrow and the volunteers are working around the clock. And everyone here is a volunteer? Yeah. It's a volunteer run, community-created event with the goal of, well... Creating community, and tomorrow is our tree-lighting. Right, which will kick off five days of events, culminating in a big dance the night before Christmas Eve. And do you get a lot of tourists? More and more every year. Yeah, Dawn grows the festival bigger and bigger every year. Yeah, I have a tendency to dream big. We had a saying... We have a saying... "Dawn dreams, I do." If you want, I can show you the Cranberry Lane offices. Yeah, I'll catch up with you guys. - Work to do... - Great. Come with me. So, below is the retail space, this is the office space. Hey, Dana. And... This is where the magic happens. You mind if we shoot some b-roll? Not at all. Let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Where's Alice? Helping grandma with her booth display. That's fun. I know. Oh, Alice loved her sleepover. How was it being home for you, though? It was confusing and strange, but also nice. Hmm. What's the "hmm"? You believe in destiny. I believe in a confluence of destiny and hard work, yes. Well, maybe this is destiny's way of pushing you two back together. You just have to do the hard work. I spoke to grandma about the moving in thing. And? She's super excited, - and packing her bags. - Really? No. Actually, I oddly kinda got the sense that part of her wanted to do it. I'm going to ignore the "oddly" and "kinda", and just go with, "see?" But don't you eventually want to start dating? Grandma moving in doesn't mean that can't happen. So will you work on her, please? I am not going to work on grandma. Grandma's gonna do what grandma's gonna do. Oh, by the way, your ornaments you ordered arrived. Actually, I was gonna talk to you about that, because we're not doing that anymore, because I have a new big idea. Of course you do. All right... What? I didn't think she could come! Well, you did say you were going to cancel the whole festival, so, you know... You're so happy. I'm so happy! All it takes is sugar mixed with heavy cream, and... And a little more heavy cream on the top. Very true. Well, I'm going to head to my sister's. Hey, listen, you know, you don't have to stay at your sister's. I mean, I could stay with my parents, or we could both... Dawn! Gabe! Did you know she was coming? No, I didn't. - Hi! - Hi! Gabe, it's so nice to finally meet! It's a pleasure to meet you. Big... big fan. I'm so sorry it's under such surprising circumstances, but Dawn, I called you several times today. I'm so sorry. I just, I guess with the shooting and festival prep, I didn't have time to check my phone. Well, this morning, we aired the segments that we shot here yesterday, and our viewers loved it and want more. So I was thinking... And I was hoping to have this conversation before just showing up here... But what if... I came to the tree-lighting, and did some of my show from here tomorrow? Then I'll just head back to the city with Beth and Leroy. It would be amazing for Cranberry Lane, especially this close to the busiest shopping days of the year. That sounds great, you know, and it would be really good for the town. They'd be so excited to have you here, I mean... Actually, would you be our tree-lighting master of ceremonies. I would be honored. So where are you staying? Haven't figured it out yet. Everything in town is booked. - Yeah. - Stay with us. - No. - Absolutely. You could stay with us. I couldn't possibly impose. I've already shown up unannounced. We insist. No imposition at all, really. Well, then, I won't be too polite. Thank you so much. I'm gonna call my driver now to pick up my bags. Are you sure about this? Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, just a couple nights. You are so star-struck. I am not star... You should have seen your face when she came over here, you were like... So cool... Good morning... Good morning! Cappuccino? Yes, please. I heard you moving around. By the way, your home is gorgeous... Thank you. ...and Bristol is adorable. It kind of reminds me of my hometown. New Jersey, right? I told you I was your biggest fan. Davie, New Jersey. My brothers are still there. They're raising their kids right down the street from where we grew up. That is so sweet. Do you get back often? Wish I did, but not really. I understand. How is it? Do I taste cranberry? You do. It is Gabe's cranberry syrup. He actually brews it in the barn. Can I see? Yeah. Gabe makes the syrup here? Yes. Excuse us interrupting, but I needed to see where your magical cranberry syrup comes from. Welcome, and no interruption at all. This is where I brew the syrup. I do extracts and juice. In the fall, I do jam. So is this the next stage in Cranberry Lane's expansion? Into the food market? No, I mean... Although, who knows? I-I, well... We just never really know... What stage we're gonna go to next. Really? You guys don't have a five-year plan? A ten-year plan? No, we never really had a plan. No, it was more, have big dreams, and have fun making them a reality, and we just grew the company that way. No concrete goal or end point except... "Except"? Except, no, we just, we always said we had no idea where life would take us, but we knew where we'd end up... And that was sitting side by side in the rocking chairs on the back porch, sipping tea and watching the bogs all day. The porch where you guys got engaged? Yeah. We should get to the festival. Yes. - Yeah, take some. - Thank you. Whoa! Hi. Congratulations! The festival looks more beautiful than ever. Well, not my doing, but thank you. Looks like grandma is the biggest draw. Grandma, look at this line! Well, what can I say, people have good taste... ...and I think Pamela's show really upped festival attendance. It definitely did. Grandma, I hope you're saving me something special for Christmas. Actually, I've been working on something very special for you. But I've said too much. No. You haven't. What is it? It's a secret. When and if the time is right, you'll find out. Come on, just tell me. Thank you. - Thanks. - Busy. I can't believe Pamela Franks slept at your house! Is she as amazing as she seems? More amazing. You should see her walk on water. And in the bigger news? Dawn came home? Yeah, she took our room, and I slept on the pull-out. And did you tell her? No. I just can't find the right time. At this point, Gabe, the right time is just as soon as possible. Yeah. Welcome to Bristol's 10th annual cranberry Christmas festival! We are so excited to have you! Now, for those of you who have attended before, you know that we always kick off the festival with our tree-lighting. But you may have noticed that the tree is not decorated. No, it is not, and that's because this year, we are starting a new tradition... Our family's tradition... Of making our own ornaments, and decorating the tree, all of us together. Yes. So we have lots of supplies for you guys to go through, but we have a special helper here... Everybody, give a big, warm welcome to... Pamela Franks! Yeah! Merry Christmas, and thank you so much for having me. You all have been incredibly welcoming and gracious, and being here has reminded of the true spirit of the season, being together, connecting. So thank you. Now, let's get decorating! I knew you'd be here. Am I that predictable? No. I just know you that well. You really do. Listen... Dawn, come take a picture with us! Okay. Just... I'll be right back, okay? It's time to light the tree! Five, four, three, two, one! Merry Christmas! All the kids, come on up! Come on up. I need to talk to you, and I know now is not the right time for this, but... The Miller property, the 100 acres for sale next to the farm... Yeah? I put an offer in on it. We put an offer in. And... why would we do that? Because I want to expand the farm. Okay... But how will you expand the farm and also co-run Cranberry Lane? Yeah. I'm leaving the company. I don't know, it was... It was really hard. Dawn looked so hurt, and I can understand why. Well, talk to her about it. I'm sure she's back home by now. Here, go. Come on. I'll finish up here. Thank you. We need to talk. Yeah, we do. Incoming. I thought I heard you two. Hi! Exciting news. We just aired the tree-lighting segment, and it was a hit! Numbers aren't in yet, but we had an incredible response on social. The viewers loved it. I loved it. Being here has been really special. It's inspired another idea. I don't want to intrude any more than I already have, but I was wondering what you thought of me staying through the end of the festival? I'd shoot the rest of my special here, host my grand finale at the dance. Yeah, that's... Actually, forget it. You've been so generous already, and this is a lot to spring on you. We'll just plan it better next year. - Look, we really... - Yes... ...appreciate you being here. It's been amazing for the town, the festival, and Cranberry Lane. I mean, our online sales are through the roof... - Huge... - And really, that's thanks to you and the show, so... - Yeah. - ...Please, stay. Are you sure? Absolutely. Please, no, you can judge the cookie bake-off this afternoon. Perfect! Thank you so much. I'm gonna call my producers. Yay. - Yay. - Yay. Yeah. That's Lauren dropping Alice off to bake cookies. Of course. Yeah. So, you want to make gingerbread people? Yes. Well, the bake-off rules say that the cookies have to be cranberry inspired. So cranberry gingerbread people, and we can build them a cranberry gingerbread house! Or even a cranberry gingerbread farm just like your farm! You dream big, just like your aunt. I definitely do. I'm gonna take over Cranberry Lane one day. Uncle Gabe, do you want to help with the cookies? Sure, yeah. What's... what's my job? You can help me measure the flour. Oh, okay. I guess was hoping for, like, frosting eater or taste tester. Uncle Gabe is a professional taste tester. Basically an Olympian. Alice, do you wanna know the secret to making perfect gingerbread? No, thank you. Oh, shot down. Why not? Because we can't make perfect gingerbread because nothing is perfect. Touché. And don't you always say on TV that it's not about being perfect, it's about it being perfectly you? Yeah, I do always say that. Oh, this is so good! Pamela Franks is eating my cookies! Try to play it cool, mom. That's gonna be hard. Thank you for baking with Alice. - She had so much fun. - Aw... Not to add something else to your plate, and I know you have a lot going on, but have you had the chance to talk to grandma? Can I ask why this is so important to you? I worry about her. I know that she misses mom and dad, and I think maybe she feels alone, and it would do her good to know that somebody is taking care of her. I'll talk to her. Cranberry shortbread? Yes, thank you. That was for... Dawn. I know this isn't an ideal time to talk. Yeah, seems like it never is. I know. I'm just confused. I mean, I know that you wanted time away from the company, but I didn't realize you wanted to leave. I didn't either. For years, I loved Cranberry Lane. The dreaming, and the bootstrapping, and the doing it together... But then it just became all about marketing meetings and constant travel, and there was just no time left for the farm, or the things that I loved to do. I get it. I do. Honestly, I feel the same way. I miss being home, and being creative, and being with you. And that was the biggest problem. There was... No time for us. You were so consumed in work, and expanding the brand, and being the perfect face for the company that the only time we did have together was when we were pretending to be "Mr. and Mrs. Cranberry Lane..." And it just... Felt like we'd grown apart. I wish you would have told me. I know. I should have. I don't know why I didn't. We decided to take time apart... ...and then the Miller property just came up for sale, and I didn't... I couldn't find the right time to tell to you about it, so I just put an offer in, and I should not have made that decision without talking to you. No, you shouldn't have. I know. And also, I support it. I do. I want you to accomplish your dreams. It just really hurt that I was not a part of them. I'm sorry. It hurt me to feel like I wasn't able to dream alongside of you. I'm really sorry about that. Time to announce the winner of the Christmas cookie contest! Hi! I had the supreme honor of getting to sample all those delicious cookies, and the supreme challenge of just picking one winner, which is Mary Powell's chewy white-chocolate and cranberry cookie. Congratulations, Mary! I'd love to feature your recipe on my blog. Words, Mary. Thank you! You're welcome. Somebody should have told your mom to play it cool. This is her playing it cool. Hello? Hey! I'm in the kitchen. Hi, honey. I promised Mary I'd help her find a good home for the leftover bake-off cookies. I will make cookie butter. Actually, I am so glad that you are here. Well, of course you are. Who doesn't love a visit from me? Everyone loves a visit from you. I'm actually happy that you're here because I wanted to talk to you about moving in with Lauren. I don't want to pressure you, because I know you love your independence. Yes, I do, but also it would be fun to live with them, and I think that Lauren feels alone and wants to be taken care of. I think so, too. I'm just not sure that I'm the answer, and I don't want her to use me moving in as an excuse not to get back out there. So... So. How are you and Gabe? That's actually why you stopped by. The cookies were a ruse. So? It's still complicated. Marriage is complicated. But yours wasn't complicated. Are you kidding? Honey, the 41 years I was married to your grandpa were anything but simple. Really? Well, of course, and your parents had their share of ups and downs, too. Mom and dad just seemed like such a perfect couple. As perfect as Mr. and Mrs. Cranberry Lane? Dawn, honey, there are no perfect marriages, just imperfect people that don't give up on each other. That is true... And I don't want to give up. Need any help? Hey. Hey... Just finished clearing some brush, making some kindling. Here, you can help. So, I guess next year, you'll be farming all of that, too. Well, the offer hasn't gone through yet, and even if it does, there's still... A lot to figure out. Like what? I don't know, I was thinking that, you know, come autumn, I think I'd want to lead tours, you know, so visitors can see the harvest in action, learn about the connection between Bristol's history and cranberry farming. That's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know what you could do, you could do a "grower's experience tour", have them put on waders, and bag berries. That's good, yeah. They could, like, try their hand at, like, sorting berries in the separator. Yes! Yes, and then afterwards, you could host a taste-testing of the cranberry syrup or the juice. Okay, whoa. I actually was dreaming about building a gift shop, where I could sell locally-made cranberry products. That's great, and on the busy weekends, you could do a pop-up cafe, where you just sell cranberry desserts. My mom could do the baking. She would love that. You could do events, workshops... Cranberry canning? Cranberry wine? We could do bog-side dinners... Cooked by local chefs. "We." I'm excited for you, if you need my help or support, I'm here. Thank you. Yeah. What's that smile? What? I don't know, it was just fun to get to toss ideas around again. Except this time, you're the dreamer. Yes, I am, and I like it. And don't get me wrong, I did always enjoy being the do-er in the relationship, but it's nice to be the dreamer, too. Another thing you never told me. Okay. Why didn't you ever say anything? I don't know. I guess I thought we couldn't both be dreamers. It's getting cold. Gonna snow tonight. Nope, it's not going to snow tonight. Right, that's right. I forgot that you also moonlight as a meteorologist. Well, I've never been wrong, and it's not going to snow tonight. Okay. Maybe tomorrow. Well, I guess we should head to the festival? Check in on everything? I guess, but I kinda think it's all taken care of. Dawn Powell, are you suggesting we play hooky? Maybe. We could relax here, watch a Christmas movie, drink some hot cocoa? With your homemade marshmallows? Are there any other kind? No. Wait, are we gonna watch that Christmas movie we've seen a hundred times about the Princess? No, of course not. So over it. Good. We're going to watch the sequel. She's a Queen now! Queen now? Well, my lord, I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. I love her, my lord. Are you crying? What? No! I just... Not me. I'm the strong, silent type. Yeah, yeah... I got something in my eye. Right. Did you get it? - I think so. - Okay. By the way, where did you hang that mistletoe I gave you? You gotta find it. Ooh! Hey! Come in, come in, come in! Hi! - It's cold out! - Yeah. I hear it's gonna snow tonight. No, but maybe tomorrow. How was the festival? It was wonderful! I ate a ton, and made lots of new friends. Well, your fans love you. And I also competed in the cranberry-stringing competition, and failed miserably. So... What do we have here? Well, I'm taking the leftover cookies from the bake-off, and I'm turning them into cookie butter for stocking stuffers. Little festive touch... For your stocking. Aw... There is no way this will make it the four days until Christmas Eve without me eating it, But thank you. You're welcome. Dawn... I want to discuss something with you. Okay, you want to sit? I fear I haven't been entirely honest about why I'm here. Okay... I came here to cover the festival, but also, I came here to cover you. I've been following your career for years, and you've always impressed me. You're charismatic, talented, and heartfelt, but most importantly, you're real, and I know you said Gabe is focused on the farm right now, so I wanted to run this by you first, but I suddenly have a spot opening up in my programming, and I think that you and Gabe would be a good fit. You mean... Your own TV show on my channel. An hour-long spot every week shot in our studio in New York. "DIY with Dawn and Gabe." Crafting, baking, decorating, cooking. Special guests, organic product placement. It would be huge for Cranberry Lane, and even bigger for Mr. and Mrs. Cranberry Lane. So... What do you think? Trust me, you're gonna want the earrings. Come back in ten minutes, and I'll have it gift-wrapped for you. Okay, work your magic. If I do, will you spill the beans on my mysterious Christmas gift? Nope. I can keep a secret. No, you can't. So back to the important stuff. What did Gabe say when you told him about Pamela's offer? I haven't. You two need to work on your secret-keeping. I know, I'm just worried that it's gonna complicate things more when everything's just starting to get better. I know Gabe doesn't want to do the show. I don't even know if I want to do the show. I just, I want more time to be creative, and let my mind wander. The show means moving to New York, and I want more time here. But my own TV show? It would be an incredible opportunity. So, what are you going to do? I don't know. Mom, come here. Let me help you there. Thank you. Oh, honey, did you hear that my cookie recipe was featured on Pamela's blog? I did hear it. Very exciting. Well, it was your doing, I mean, bringing Pamela here, so I guess I should thank you. Although, off what we're seeing between you and Dawn, maybe you should thank us. And why would I be thanking you? Well, we told you to say yes to Pamela's show because, well, we knew it would bring you and Dawn back together... What masterminds. Now I guess I know where I get my dubious ploys, but thank you. Although I do think the real reason you told me to say yes was so that you could meet Pamela. Two birds. - Surprise! - Hey! I'm everywhere! The ghost of Christmas future. Maybe. Can we talk? Yeah. Dawn... Not to overstep, or rush your decision, but I have to be honest, I'm very confused. I knew Gabe might be tentative but I at least thought that you'd be excited for your own show. I know. Why the hesitation? Well, it's partially less time home, and less time in my creative role at Cranberry Lane, but mostly, it is that work has already put a strain on my marriage. I understand. Not that it's the same thing, but I lost a long-term relationship to late nights and weekends at the office. Donald. We were together seven years, engaged for three. That's a long engagement. Well, I could never find the right window in my schedule to get married. I'm sure you understand. Yeah... Dawn, I watched the footage about you and Gabe not having time to replace your engagement ring. So, eventually, Donald decided that if I didn't have enough time to get married, how could I possibly have time for a marriage? So, every year, I buy far too many Christmas presents for my brothers and their families, and every year, I say that this will be the year that I deliver them in person, and then, every year, something comes up at work, and then it's, "next year, we'll spend the holidays together," but it's always next year. So I can assure you that you can "have it all," whatever that means, but also, maybe, you have to make sacrifices. Something to think about. Dawn! Hi. Guess what the advent calendar has us doing today? Are you excited? Don't think you're Santa's village-ing without me! Let me get in here. Let's see if I can win you one. Okay, let's let your aunt Dawn show you how it's done. Watch out, she's a ringer. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Thank you! Can we fish for candy canes next? Of course. You are so happy. I'm so happy. I miss this. I miss you. I miss you, too. Family photo? Do you want a family photo? Yes! Say "merry Christmas!" - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. What are you doing? Well, we got these leftover marshmallows, I thought, "roast 'em." And here I thought you were creating a romantic moment for us. Well, that too, but you know... Marshmallows. They are good. So, some news... Our offer was accepted. The property is ours... If we want it. Gabe, you want it. I do. - You do... - Yeah. ...and I want you to have it. What does that mean for us? Because I want the farm, yeah. I want to plant more acres, and do... tastings, and workshops, and dinners, but... It doesn't mean anything without you, because you're the real dream. Us, here, you know... Raising a family, growing old, lazing our days away in our rocking chairs. I still want all that. I still want all of that, too. What? - What? - You were right. Of course I was. About what? It's snowing. Every single time. Here to help? I'd love to, but I've got to get to Lauren's and start the prep for Christmas Eve dinner for tomorrow. But you're coming to the dance tonight, right? Wouldn't miss it. Why aren't you at your booth? Because I sold out. In record time, not that anybody's keeping track. Definitely not you. Well, I'm going to head out now, but before I do... I haven't told Gabe yet. The Millers accepted our offer, and I want Gabe to have it, and I worry that he will give it up for the show. Well, for me. Because he'd know you want it. Yes. That's tough, honey, and I'll be here for you however I can be. Thanks. I have some big news myself. I've decided to move in with Lauren and Alice. Have you? And what made you decide that? I realized that even if she can't admit it, I think Lauren needs someone, and I want to be there for her... And maybe I need someone, too. But, hey, maybe with me under her roof all the time, she'll be more inclined to date just to escape me. Maybe. Hey! - Hi! - Hi! Hi. I've come to badger you. Okay. Good night, grandma. See you later. Made any decisions yet? I have not. I don't want to pressure you... But I'm going to anyway. You leave tomorrow? I will have an answer for you by then. Okay, and Dawn, I wanted to tell you that I don't just understand your hesitation, I respect it. There are some days I feel I wouldn't do any of it differently... But there other days... Especially since being here and getting to take what feels like the first breather in years... That I wonder what all of this is for if I don't have anyone to share it with. I know you said you and Gabe never had a five- or ten-year plan, but I find that the best way to make a decision is to have a clear vision of what you really want. Don't just ask yourself what you want, ask yourself, "what does it look like?" Thank you. You're welcome. I'll get back to work. Hello? Hi. It's Pamela. You look beautiful. You clean up pretty well yourself. Hey, so I was wondering... Would you like to be my date for the dance? Well, this is awkward, because I kinda thought I was. Presumptuous. Gonna snow again tonight. You... You and your meteorology, frozen-hot-chocolate obsession, your eerily-good throwing arm... ...the way your eyes crinkle when you smile. I'm still looking for the mistletoe. Right. I should have hung it there, but I didn't. And it's our last night here at Cranberry Lane... Hey! Hey. I made a decision. I'm telling Pamela no. Really? But Dawn, you didn't even discuss it with Gabe, and also, you want the show. Well, parts of it, yes, and parts of it, no. Like the part where I have to be away from home, and Gabe, and you guys. Gabe spent the last decade making my dreams come true, and now it's his turn, which means it's my turn to sacrifice. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I'm worried you'll regret it if you don't take it. Maybe I will, but you know what I will regret is not having time with Gabe and you guys, because that is something that I already regret. - Aunt Dawn. - Yes. You know what the advent calendar wants us to do today? Dance! Come on! Hi, Pamela! I was hoping you'd sign your cookbook for me? Of course! I really did love your cookies. I'm putting my email in here. Maybe we can start a recipe exchange... And hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other in the coming year. That is, if Dawn and Gabe do the show. Oh, I didn't realize they were keeping it under wraps, but between you and me, I offered Dawn and Gabe their own show on my network. You did? Yes, but they haven't given me an answer yet, so we'll see. There we go. - Thank you. - Thank you. Let's talk to him. - Honey. - Hey. Honey, why didn't you tell us that Pamela offered you and Dawn a show? - What's going on? - Yeah! What are you talking about? Pamela just told me that she offered you and Dawn a show on her channel? What? Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Did Pamela offer us a TV show? Yes. I am so sorry that I didn't say anything. It's just... Things were just starting to get better between us, and then the Millers accepted our offer, and honestly, I just didn't want you to even have to think about sacrificing anything for the show. So did you decide no for us? Gabe, I know you don't want the show. Yeah, but I know that you do. But the show is you and me. Well, talk to Pamela, and just see if it could be about you. And then what, and then I go to New York, and then you stay here, and we never see each other? That's not gonna work... Look, I don't know, okay? But we can find a way to make it work. We haven't been making it work. It's... Maybe it's a sign. A sign of what? A sign we want different things, a sign that we've grown apart. - What are you talking about? - I don't know... I just don't want you to give up anything for me. So instead, you want me to give you up? So first, you leave the company, and now this. See, it feels like you just don't want us to be together, because I keep looking for a way to move us forward, and you just keep looking for a way out. I... I'm sorry I lied, and I hope you know that it wasn't for your cameras, or even for Cranberry Lane. I think I just so desperately wanted it to be true, you know? For us to be that couple again. Dawn, I don't think you lied. Nothing I saw was a lie... And I talked to Gabe, and I know that he doesn't want to do the show, but if you do, it could be yours alone, or we could find a co-host. It's really hard for me to say this... But I gotta say no. I don't know what's gonna happen with Gabe and me, but when I thought about what I wanted, and what that looked like, it looked like being here. I understand. Thank you so much for a special, a very special holiday. Thank you, for everything. My pleasure. So, where are you off to? Actually, change of plans. I'm headed to New Jersey to spend Christmas with my brothers and their families. I'm finally gonna deliver their presents to them in person. That is fantastic. And I wanted to tell you, I called Donald... ...and we're gonna have lunch in the new year. I love it. You gotta hope for second chances. Merry Christmas, Dawn. Merry Christmas. Yeah, you have to use the right kind of apples. It's sticking. Rotate the dough while you're rolling and that'll stop it from sticking. Like this? Perfect! Maybe I'll teach you a couple of baking tricks when I live here. Maybe I'll teach you a couple tricks, like organizing and scheduling? Dawn... How you doing? Honey, just go talk to Gabe. Grandma, I don't... I don't know that he wants to talk to me. I don't know that he still wants to be together. Then find out. Don't give up. I'm not the one giving up. Excuse me, girls. I just remembered I have a Christmas gift to deliver. And she's off. Well, at least some good news... Grandma has decided to move in with us. I heard that. I'm happy for you. Thank you. I'm also worried for you. Come on. Get over here. I know you're hurt, and I know you're scared. Believe me, I am right there with you, but, sis, you can't give up on love. Are you right there with me for that, too? Like I said, I'm not the one giving up. Are you sure? Hello? Hello? Hi. Don't "hi" me. My granddaughter is moping on Christmas Eve. I know. I'm sorry, I just, I don't want her to give up the show for me, and... That's marriage. It's tough. A lot of the time, you have no idea what to do... No. ...and there's a big learning curve, and the stakes are high, and the rookie mistake is thinking it ought to be easy, but it's not easy. It takes work, and I'll tell you what I'd tell Dawn... "Express what you're thinking because he can't read minds." Admit your shortcomings, because they're obvious anyway, and do the work, because making your marriage last, fighting for your love, is the most beautiful, and challenging, and terrifying, and worthwhile work you will ever do. And here... Are Mary and Shelton still coming? Merry Christmas! We brought pies! Thank you. I thought you guys knew that Gabe wasn't coming. Come on, it's cold. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Come in, come in! - Hi. - Hi. Could we talk privately? Yeah. I'm sorry. I know it could feel like I was giving up, but I wasn't, I just... I didn't want you to sacrifice for me, and I didn't want you to give up on your big dreams. But Gabe... You are my big dream, and I realized it's not, "I dream, you do," "you dream, I do," it's, "we dream... We do." I am happy to sacrifice for you, because you are the most important thing to me in my life, and I am so sorry that I did not make you feel that way. I am so sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you how I was feeling. Well, look at that, our marriage isn't perfect. We're not perfect. Well, doesn't someone have a catch phrase about that? I think someone used to have a catch phrase about that. Come here. We have worked so hard together. Like, so hard. I know. Let's work hard together for each other. Okay? Deal. I forgot, I have this little Christmas gift for you. Is this the mystery gift? I don't know. I designed it, and grandma made it. It is perfect. It is so perfect! Dawn... You're not just my wife, you're my best friend, and my business partner, my muse. You're my dreamer... ...You're my do-er, my meteorologist. Will you continue to marry me? Yes. Forever. - I love you. - I love you. Dinner's ready! Hold that thought. I guess we should eat. Gabe? Gabe? Whatcha doing out here? I'm waiting for you. So... I got some news. I talked to Pamela, and I pitched her a different TV show idea. Cranberry Lane in its natural habitat. You and me, here, expanding the farm, and all the craziness that goes along with it. Are you kidding? I'm not. And she loved it. She did? - She did. - That's amazing! Are you sure you want to do this? I do. I wish I knew where you hung that mistletoe. Look up. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
