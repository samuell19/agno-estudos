[music playing] [chattering] [laughing] [slot machines] WOMAN: Another seven. Another seven. Come on, baby. [ringing] [laughing] MAN: All right, all right, all right, all right. [ringing] You going to play? How much? Uh. Silver? Change. Please. It's $2 minimum. [slot machines] Hit me. Just make a signal with your cards. Don't cover your cards, sweetheart. Jesus. What do you got? Too much. Play another hand? Another hand? No. [ringing] JEAN: One hand? You drove 200 miles, played one hand, and drove all the way back? That's what I did. JEAN: Well, I hope it was a pretty drive. I wasn't paying much attention. JEAN: I've seen cases Stacy Lancaster, but you are a case. Oh, I know. JEAN: Well, you're going to have to pull yourself together. I'm trying. That's why I'm in this class. But it isn't easy. I've always been shy. Hey, nobody's going to do it for you, but maybe you could use a little coaching. [music playing] [chattering] Is this your daughter? Son? Whoops. Thank you. [chattering] The system says double. I know. I have this feeling. But the system says-- Hey, you wanna play? [chattering] What are you doing? That's it. Don't stop now. I don't want to play anymore. [applause] Excuse me. Listen, I know that pit boss was giving you fits, but don't ever do that again. You've got a good feel, and that deck was scorching. You could've gone a lot bigger. You OK? She's all right. Well, I don't know what her story is, but you never quit on a streak till it ends. Hey, she's running out with 580 smackers. That's something. [laughing] What you got there, ladies, is a handful of bird seed. Bird seed. [ringing] [bird chirping] [radio playing] Good God, Buster. What? Restless again. BUSTER: You're the one that's restless. You get restless, I get restless. I ain't restless. Bullshit, Will. You got casino fever. You been thinking again about trying to break the bank. Been [inaudible] your hand for a couple of days now. That ain't true. I don't have to be no doctor to see what's going on. You're down with a bad case. But go on. Get it out. You do what you got to do. I'll keep digging till you get back. You wanna eat? STACY: I wanna to be a lawyer, not a gambler. JEAN: Fine But that guy was right. People push you around. STACY: I know. JEAN: Then let's concentrate on pushing back while we work with that power of yours. Blackjack. Wayne, would you look at that? Oh, boy. Hey, is that a mouse, or is that a mouse? [chattering] Didn't think I'd see you two again. The birdseed brought us back. [laughing] I see. [beeping] Young lady? You need anything, you just ask. Compliments of the house. JEAN: Who's he? WILL: That is Mr. Shecky Poole He's been the main man here for a long time. He'd rather be Casanova. Heart like a barracuda. What have we got here? Is Shecky making a move? Yeah, he just put a knock out on her. Get her out of there. What? Get her out now. Keno. Last call. Volcano Keno, last call. I don't get it. OK. Look, when it's time to draw to his own hand, the dealer peeks at his top card. JEAN: So? So if he likes it, he deals it to himself. And if he doesn't, he takes his chances on a second card. Isn't that cheating? Right. They just wanted to see how much you know. Shouldn't we report it? I don't know. The owner? The owners probably hand-picked him. Oh. Yeah. So what do you do? Just what you did. You leave. What's on your mind? She's good. I don't know how good, but she's definitely got something. So I'm not talking birdseed. I'm talking Filet Mignon. You want to learn the hard way, you could probably find your way around shoes and shills and dobbers, Shecky Pooles, comp tricks, and all around nastiness. But without a good system, any half-assed dealer is just going to dust your crock. And even then, it's tough. That's a straight line. Look, do you want to do it? I get one third of the action, and you get access to a system that will have them running for cover, my expertise and unqualified assistance on everything. Everything? Look, my gut's telling me we could be great together. And I always trust my gut. That's why I'm lousy at cards. Is that it? That's it. We got a deal? OK. All right. Oh, hey. The reason I talk about guts so much is because that's exactly what it's going to take. You should think about that too. [crying] I think, and I think, and I try, and I try. And I always come back to the same damn thing. I can't do this. [sobbing] You're all worked up, and nothing's even happened. Don't fight it. Go at it a while. We'll see what happens. Look, you can get up anytime you like. Hm? Who knows? It might even be fun. Oh, Edward, I'm not married or in a satanic cult. I'm just having fun and making money. No. Just tell Richard to cover classes before the break. , Oh I don't know. Maybe a week, maybe longer. I will. OK. Oh, thanks, Edward. Goodbye. Bye. It's your turn. Oh, maybe I'll just write. It sounds more official on paper. If you don't call, you're going to stew in your own juice about being irresponsible or something. And we can't afford that. Call. What do I say? I quit? WILL: It's my uncle's summer cabin. Except my uncle spends his summers in Mexico now. STACY: Who takes care of it? WILL: I do. Wait till you see this place. Are we gonna live in here? It'll need some touch up, but that's no sweat. Come on, give it a chance. It's got a stove. It's got plenty of cover space. Sink. Just gotta hook that up. Come on. Hey, look at this. Chips. Ah. And a beautiful view of the Truckee River. Antiques. Hey, look at this Jean. I got this for you. Cute. Boudoir. This place has everything we need. Has it got a broom? [crickets] She always looks so sloppy. Yeah. So? She's supposed to be a high roller. She ought to look like one. Otherwise, we're going attract even more attention. We'll have plenty as it is. You're right. She doesn't have anything snappier to wear? Just what you've seen. God, she sure needs working on. I'll do my best. [crickets] WILL: [inaudible] keep them out. You gotta hit it-- you gotta hit it hard. Hard. [laughing] Really hard. You got-- [laughing] You got-- [laughing] You gotta bet when it's hot. You understand? Yeah. You understand? I'll try and do that. [laughing] Oh, no. I got to go. I got to get going. Going? Yeah. I got out to the mine and check on something. Oh no, you don't. You're not leaving us alone out here. Uh-uh. There's nothing to be afraid out here. [laughing] Do you want me to tuck you in too? [laughing] [chattering] I don't believe that guy. Shills. House guys. Shecky can't figure out what's going on. [laughing] He thinks those guys are going to screw up her calculations. She's doing great though. Yeah, but she looks like a chicken at a black tie dinner. What do you mean? If she's supposed to be a high roller, she oughta look like one. She looks so plain. Dull. Clean. But dull. Why don't you see what you can do? OK. MAN: Hey, I didn't know Don was working swing shift. Shecky brought him in early to look her over. We better get her out of there before those guys screw her up. Well, I thought that's what we were supposed to be doing, making money. I could've won $5,000. And that would have set them wondering. So what? They already are. Look gang, uh, you can walk if you want to. But otherwise, you got to play it my way. That means taking our time and being careful. Have you taken a good look at this town? What, do you think they're in business to make us rich? What, do you think they're going to let us walk in day after day and win? Do you think it's going to be easy? You don't have to yell. Then listen. Go rent a car and pick up that stuff on the list. And let's all lighten up, for Christ sakes. And be back by sundown. [knocking] Who is it? [knocking] Just a minute. What can I-- do for you? I get my contacts in week. A week? A week's perfect. What's all this? Classroom aides for Bonner's big score gambling school. What do you mean, a week's perfect? We're not going near the casinos. We're gonna practice. And have some fun. [music playing] WILL: How we doing? Where's all this fun you talked about? [laughing] Come on, now. Work yields its own special rewards. We mean fun fun. [neighing] Isn't this fun, Jean? Fun city, boy. [music playing] [neighing] [grunting] [laughing] [shouting] [laughing] Hot diggity. Double dare. Hm. Hot. Beer? No, thanks. Jean? Just deal. OK. Eight in a row. [crickets] Holy shit. 68 winners in 101 hands is wonderful. Mwah. And 82 in 101 is-- it's great, Stacy. You're great. You are now. Don't I get one? Oh. [giggles] God damn it. Let's put on the dog. JEAN: [laughing] Anywhere you calculators want to go. [music playing] [cheering, chattering] You two can take off. I'm gonna stick around for a little while. Big day tomorrow, I hope. Can't overlook the night. It's OK, isn't it? Yeah, go on. Go. Kind of like the night before a big fight, huh? Yeah. I guess. Will, I'm not a gambler. Who's gambling? You're only playing the percentages, Stacy. You know what I mean. Nobody wants to gamble with anything. And when they do, it's usually for the wrong reasons. But you-- forget it. What? Well, maybe you're already a gambler. Maybe it's for the right reasons. [birds chirping] Sorry. It's OK. [knocking] Yes? Oh, hello, Mr. C. You might check out the floor, sir. There's a girl up over $12,000. - Blackjack? - Yes, sir. She's still playing. MAN: Hey, that's the mouse, isn't it? Yeah, and not doing bad. [slot machines] Hey, the limit's 200. I feel lucky. Let her play. When you're finished, would you drop into my office? It's on the mezzanine. I'm about finished. It's your party. They haven't sprouted anything yet. My sniffer says she's up to something. Cute little broad. She's cute with house money. What happened? You know that guy with Poole? He owns the place. He wants me-- you too-- to go to Las Vegas, all expenses paid, in his private jet. WILL: What place? The Silver Load. He owns that too. That's the best. SHECKY: OK. What's the total figure? MAN: $24,000 grand. We'll get her back in a couple of days. SHECKY: We can't even until you figure out how she works her scam. MAN: We work a little different in Vegas, Shecky. You'll find out. SHECKY: I hope so, Boss. Tell me, what have you got on his Bonner character? He's just a local loser. He's sweet on the girl or something. He's just picking up crumbs. But he's not splitting the sheets, eh? Yeah, that's right. [laughing] Have a good trip. Righto. Give it to them good, huh? Both girls. [laughing] [music playing] [laughing] JEAN: Ah, I love it. STACY: Wow. [laughing] WILL: Look at that. Look at that, Jean, look at that. Oh, too much fun. [inaudible] Look at this place. What a [inaudible]. JEAN: This is the life. [laughing] JEAN: Oh, Stacy. STACY: Oh, my god. Wow. This is gorgeous. STACY: Look. JEAN: Wow. This is too much. This is just too much. Look at this stuff. [music playing] [birds chirping] [chattering] Oh, I wanna relax awhile. MAN: Hey, babe, do you wanna relax with me? [laughing] That girl's no loser. She better be. MAN: Whoa, we got another $100 winner on carousel number seven. That's two today. Two today. $100 winner on carousel number seven. Come on. I don't know how long this can last. Come on down. Carousel number seven is hot. Bust down your [inaudible]. MAN: Wow. [inaudible] Do you see that? Here it comes. - This way. - They got a [inaudible]. - You're coming with us. - This way. Watch it. [chattering] A what? Card marker. He's been marking the cards with ink by taking it off the back of his ear. It's a lot easier to win that way when you know where the face cards are. I'm sorry, Miss. I'm really sorry. She's clean. No calculators, no wires, no cards, nothing. [beeping] [chattering] Is she counting, or what? Yeah, she's counting a little bit. But she's got a lot of luck working for her too. It's uncanny. She just doesn't lose many hands. How much is she into us for? $21,000. Oh, god damn it. She's on the floor right now. Who's our knock out? Marian. Get her on the little bitch. Glue her on. [chattering] She's been winning the whole hour? [chattering] [slot machines] [chattering] [ringing] WOMAN: She's a better dealer. What do we got? This girl is something. Still winning? No. She's not losing either. I've never seen anyone Marian couldn't bury. [chattering] I want to see the cards. What's the trouble? I want to see those cards. I said, what's the trouble? That deck is short. MAN: You want to prove that? I will if you let me see the cards. - Stacy. - I'm all right. We don't shows cards to anyone but members of the Gaming Commission. She's cheating. Stacy. She's cheating me. Listen, we're onto your little game. The word on you people has gone out. I'll give you a simple choice. You can play here by house rules, or you can leave, which just might be your best bet. I want to see those cards. You lay one finger on her, and your face is bent! Get me pictures on all three of them. Make up a special circular and get it out fast. I want everyone to know who they are. Black book, full entries. Hi. Hi. Hi. Where you been? Spending money. On? Still leaking? Yep. What you spend your money on? Oh. Can you fix it? JEAN: I'm not sure. Law books, huh? Yeah, well, I thought I'd have to get them eventually. What are you doing? I'm getting out of here. Why? Because there's nothing for me to do here. You two have quit on me. You've gone belly up. Are you coming back? You want to go to law school? Then go. You want to tinker with the sink? Tinker. You want to make another move, then make it. But twist your own arms. I'm going out to the mine. [barking] We could sit around the lake a couple of days. Yeah. Tahoe would be nice. For a couple of days anyway. What about Will? [inaudible] about Will. [birds chirping] MAN: Hey, county car. [car doors shutting] Uh, we can't think of anything else to do here. We've got a load of money, so there's no reason to stay. I want you to come and visit. Bullshit. Look, we really good about the decision. Will. That's bullshit. Go ahead, wrap up your little pile of money and go on back. But don't fool yourself with this "we feel good" crap. I'm not sure why you came to Reno, but I know it was for more than scoring bucks. I don't think you got what you came for. Not yet anyway. We're just not finished here, and you know it. There's one more card we can play. I can make a phone call and see. Come on, god damn it. What do you say? MAN (ON PHONE): How good is she? As good as dad was. Maybe better. MAN (ON PHONE): There's the point. What point? MAN (ON PHONE): The point your father passed and shouldn't have. I just want to see if she can get to that point. If you saw her play, you'd want it too. MAN (ON PHONE): And then what? And then we'll see. MAN (ON PHONE): No, William. Seeing is what cost your father everything. All right, then, to the point, and no further. He was a really weird character when I was a kid. He's still a weird guy. You would be too if you knew things nobody else in the world know. That's why the casinos made him a deal for life, but he still knows. How's he going to give up secrets like that? Everybody tells secrets. Believe me, it's a big deal just meeting him. How old is this Kid? Old. Not likely. You said you'd talk to her. Take 10 minutes. Feel like a few hands? Sure. [clanking chips] 40 Minutes. Come back tomorrow about this time. May I call you Mr. Kid? Fine. Mr. Kid, I know all this. Stay with me, Miss Know-It-All. [ticking] All winners. Now we begin. I want you to forget all about graphs, statistics, charts, percentages. They'll always be there. I want you to open your mind. I want to learn how to feel. There's life in here. I want you to see it move. I don't know. KID: Yes, you do. Where's the power? This one's strong. Nothing here. Nothing here. So, so. This one's strong. Nothing here. So, so. Where's the winner? Here. Close. STACY: Six, eight. Keep going. King, queen. KID: Stay in there. Two, three. KID: Go with it. Ace. Nine, 10, five, eight, king, four, seven, eight, ace, three, nine, seven, two, four, five, queen, nine, jack, three, six, 10, queen, two, ace, queen, five, three, seven, ace, two, king, jack, two, five, king, 10, jack, king, queen, five, seven, two, six, nine, three, four. Can I do it without you? You should practice a little before you play. But it won't go away. Thank you. It's been my great pleasure. You know, I've been waiting for you to come along for years. I never thought you would. Look out at that desert out there. It has many secrets. Some are buried in shallow graves. Be wise. Be careful. [knocking] She raising hell? $18,000 worth. Where's Tina? MAN: She worked mid-shift. Get her out of bed. Now. [ringing] She's up $30,000. Where the hell is Shecky? He's upstairs. We don't boot customers, ever. But boss, Mr. C black booked them. We've got everybody watching her, and she's still eating us alive. How much longer are you going to let her play? Alex get me Roland. I don't give a damn. Get him in here. Hi, there. I'm Roland. Hi, Roland. I'm Trouble. [laughing] [chattering] This is getting out of control. Buzz Shecky. [slots] That's all I'm saying. You show us a system, and we'll walk. We don't have to show you anything if we think you're cheating. She doesn't have to cheat. Are you say great players can't play in this dump? She could beat any of your people blindfolded. Who the hell are you? I'm the mayor. I want you out of here. Now get out before I have you thrown out. You're the goop at the bottom of the sewer. You, your place, the people who kiss your ass. Watch out. [thwack] [shouting] Don't start a riot Get out. Slimy [inaudible]. You can't ban people from winning. Now get out of here. Get out. Get out, punk. You can't ban people for winning. We'll be back. I swear to God, we'll be back. We'll nail you to the wall. You're gonna lose, Poole. If I ever see your faces in here again, you're dead. You hear me? Dead. [inaudible] little son of a bitch. [music playing] Hey, where you going? Up to Walker's Bridge. Want some company? What are you doing later on? I'll be right here. OK. Hey. What's the latest from brain central? Disguises. Big disguises. [laughing] Here fishy, fishy fishy. [music playing] [winding sound] [dramatic music] [grunting] The coroner's ruling was accidental drowning. We know it was murder. There's no question about it. You have zero evidence. There's not much we can do with that. You mean there's not much you'll do. I mean nobody. It's a dead-end. Drop it. You're going to get yourselves into a lot of trouble by throwing accusations around. What about the casinos? Oh, we could take them to court for throwing you out, but it could took years, years, to get a ruling on eviction, and a lot of money. It's up to you. Yeah, I guess it is. JEAN: But it's so far-fetched. STACY: I've made up my mind. I'm going to put together this team of counters, and I'm going back up. JEAN: Will's dead, Stacy. You can't bring him back. STACY: Will Bonner took me a long way. Took us both a long way, but he couldn't take us far enough. We got to do it, without him. We've just got to have counters. Hey, I could do it. I don't think you can. Next, please. [music playing] There's an element of risk. That doesn't involve me. There's an element of money too. That's why I'm sitting ere. We can't just walk in there. They know what we look like. That's where your makeup friend comes in. I'd like to help you out, Jean, but I'm swamped. I got two more days here, um, back to LA, and down to the Philippines. Look, I only want one day. OK. Look up. And you, of course. Real life is not my thing. Real life pays $5,000. You serious? [music playing] Still have to keep him busy for at least two hours. We've got to have that much time. Well, if I can't get him for at least two hours, I do not belong on the stage. [music playing] I'm going to take five. Watch the new dealer. Now there's a weird duck. Hi. Hi. Buy me a drink? I'm drinking bourbon. Bourbon? Feel like talking? Well, it's been fun. (SINGING) Oh, give me a home. BOTH: Where the buffalo roam. MAN: Oh, this guy has got to be from Texas. Blackjack. Yeah, come on. I'm bad, y'all. I ain't kidding you. Lay 'em on me, baby. Sick Tina on him. Tell her to run him down good. [whistling] We're under control. Oh, this it's utterly boring. Where is the manager? Mr. Poole's right over there. If you can't get Wallace, try Roland. I want another knock out in there. Hello. What can I do for you? Well, let's find out. [cheering] Oh, Shecky. This is nice. You like it? No interruptions? No. Ah. MAN: Who's this guy? MAN: Got me. He's a betting fool, though. Is this too stiff for you? I think I can rise to the occasion. I'll bet you can. Mm. My night. Tonight is my night. You should pay attention. I'm not good at paying attention to cards. Come on. Keep 'em coming, baby. Keep 'em coming. I'm hot. I'm hot. I'm hot. I love it. Woo. What's going on down there? Where's Shecky? $2,000, $4,000, $6,000, $8,000. Thank you, sir, [inaudible]. MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Poole? Oh, Shecky. What? Tina's on another guy, but he's cleaning up too. Where's Roland? Not here yet. There's a lot of money walking out of here. Jesus. Now, where were we? Playing? - How's she doing? - Kicking ass. Easy. It's OK. MAN: Mr. Poole? No, goddamn it. MAN: I got to see you. You've been wanting to run this place for three years. Run it for half an hour. Why didn't Poole call me. You tell Poole when you find him that I'm flying up, and I'll be there an hour. And you tell him that he better have this thing turned around. MAN: This guy's betting $3,000 a pop. Where the hell is Shecky? Right here. Graybeard I want to get some things. Things? You know. Things. MAN: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I know this guy. [chattering] $4,000, $6,000. [inaudible]. Where's Shecky? Waiting for me. Where? Upstairs. - Where? - All right. All right. Room 314. Close it down. The whole place? I don't give a god damn how you do it, but clear it out and close it down, you got me? Sure. [dramatic music] [shouting] BOSS: You get your goddamn pants on while you can still walk out of her.e Wayne. It's her. WAYNE: Her? It's the mouse. It's the goddamn mouse. [ringing] Stop him! He's got a gun. [shouting] [laughing] [car starting] Where is she? Here she comes. Stop. Go, go. Step on it! Get going! [thumping] [laughing] We did it. [laughing] [cheering] $611,000. MAN: Oh, boy. [cheering] Bird seed. [laughing] [music playing]
