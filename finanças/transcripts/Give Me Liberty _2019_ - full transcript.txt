And the doctor told me, "James, you'll never walk again in your life." I said, "Man, get the fuck out of here. "You're full of shit. I'm gonna walk." But... I went to therapy, and everything I had to do, I did, to try to walk on my own. And I'd be damned if that doctor wasn't right. I never walked since that day. And that hurts me by being a quad. But... life, it is what it is. Life is wonderful. Life is beautiful. I love life. You can't fool me. I love... I love everything about life, even the ducks, the chickens, the rats. Love... Love conquers all. That's just my belief. And when you have love, you got everything, in my life. But I went a long time without love. And I've been the lonely one. I call myself "the lonely one." And I say that for a reason, because have to reach out so hard to get friends, but they're not right. And you know they're not right. And God does not like ugly. You got to deal with people that's on your level, not on their level... you know. You're going to be late. You're going to be late. You have to be on the bus at 7:45. You're going to be late.

Then you got these people who dress like him, try to sound like him. They devote their whole life to being Elvis. I just listen to his music. I just don't like the guy. To listen to Elvis, he just doesn't do it for me. In high school, there was this guy that looked like Cliff Clavin. And I let him know every day that he looked like Cliff Clavin, and he called me an asshole. His dad looks like Cliff Clavin too. Yeah, my fishes and I go way back.

You're respectful, you're honest, and you're dependable. And anything you need to know, you ask me. And if I don't know, I'll be damned if I don't find out. To tell you. That's what fathers are for. When I was your age, I had plenty of ambition. Why don't you have any? Not once have you told me "I want to do this." "I want to do that." "I wanted to be this." "I wanted to be that." Why? I'm just asking you a question, man-to-man. Or father to son. Like I do my own son. Can you answer that for me? I don't know yet. Uh... I guess I didn't find my purpose yet. You know, some things you just can't explain. It just happens. And when good things happens, you got to grab it with all you got and try to keep it the best way you can. I'm telling you the facts, not fiction. What I know. I know you're young. But you're not dumb. Be yourself. The most important part about life is livin'... That's what you know how.

I am not makin' no money, I'm puttin' money. - I'm investing. - Be a star. - That ain't no job. - What do you mean, it's not no job? - It's not a job. - Tracy, believe in him. It's your career, but he's not making any money off of it. - So how is it a career? - That's not work. It's like this... I don't have support from y'all. - Right? Nope. - I support you, Nephew.

Peace. - Bye. - Nice meetin' you. So mine says, "He who hurries cannot walk with dignity." - That's a good one. - Mm-hmm. So mine says, "The one good thing about repeating your mistakes is that you know when to cringe." I think that makes sense, right? It does. Somebody ought to know. "Wisdom comes from experience." Hey, hey, hey! - Really. - It sure does. I asked you to keep on sittin' down 'cause I want, I want to tell you a story, okay? My kids, they don't know how I am. They don't understand why I'm like I am in life. They don't. And, you know, they knew of their father, but not long enough, and the thing is, is with their dad, he... he... He-he... He was, um... He was a gambler. And then after I found out that he was a gambler... They don't know. And I don't know. Oh, can I tell him? Should I tell him? I was embarrassed. I was so embarrassed. I didn't think they would love me no more. My God... I'm so sorry. You know we love you. "The sure way to predict the future is to invent it." That is the truth.

Plus, I learned to cook chicken with my grandma, - but not like that. - Yes, you're right. No. You're taking me back to my childhood. It smells like fried chicken. I wish the children of today had learned to cook with their parents, - their grandparents, and... - Yes. Yes. Yes. Heh. They know nothing about cooking. Children and food. Children and food, that's what we need. - Yes. Yes. - Oh... We can't move in together because you want to try something new? I already got boxes packed. My family knows I'm movin' in with you.
