CJ Entertainment Presents A YONG FILM Production Let's go. Go inside. Hi, there. Come in. I'm Yim Mira. I'm Park Yuna, nice to meet you. Come in. Sit wherever you like. Yes. The waitresses are talking about how pretty you are. Where's dad? He'll come shortly. Mr. Yim. This isn't even our duty, you know that. Of course, I know that. But it'll be soon. What do you mean? Who do you think the governor will bring to serve the President? Did the governor... Then today... - Here. - Thanks. Mira. Can I call you Mira? Sure. Are you two acquainted? She's still a kid. Give her plenty of advices. Did you read it? Isn't it great? She's adorable up until middle school years or so. With funny ones too. You didn't tell her yet? No, not yet. Why do you have that? Mira... It's your mother's baby book about your upbringing. Yuna wanted to get to know you... Why does she have it? Mira! Must we do this? She wanted to know you! I asked him to let me borrow it. I'm sorry if I offended you. Let's drop it. She doesn't look like mom. A Year Later Tonight, a wavering night. A night when shadows of street lights dance. I desire to tell you tales of the old days on a night like tonight. When we first met, my world felt small and light. It grew quickly in your vast embrace. This night! The wavering night! Even without you, my night feels full now. This night! The dancing night! I don't mind where my restless walk takes me to. Baby, what's this? Take a guess. Can I open this? What time is it? Hey, here! Hey! Don't ever go clubbing with him! His face scares everyone away! Cheers! - Hey. - What? - You recognize her? - Huh? What is it? Holy shit! Put that away! - A sex tape? - What is it? Put it away! It's Yuna, Mira's stepmom! What's that? No, nothing. Give it back! What the hell is it? What is it? - Why? - It's Yuna. Get the hint! Let's drink. Come on, drink! Mira: We need to meet! Baby? Yeah? Isn't Mira's birthday coming up soon? She loves shoes, should I buy her a pair? Don't do that. She's got plenty of shoes, more than enough. She's a high roller, the sky's the limit for her. She's at that age, all my shoes are from then. She'll only be satisfied once I'm penniless. Dig in. Mira wants to see me. She does? Yeah. When? Right now, I think. Is that so? Okay, buy her some drinks and give her advice. She's still a kid. You'd be happy if she and I get along well. I didn't mean to pressure you. I'll be back. It won't take long. Wait for me. Thank you. Why am I sad, for no good reason. Mira. That car looks weird. - Zoom into that. - Yes, sir. No more nuts... I wanna sing. You're so right, we need a song. - Sing! - Sing a song! She's really good. ...unconscious this morning at her apartment parking lot. Let's go to the scene. Turn that shit off. At 2:20 AM this morning, fire broke out in the parking lot, and the emergency responders were dispatched. Officers found Yuna at the scene Singer Park Yuna, taken to Jungang Hospital and quickly moved her to the Jungang Hospital. Cause of the fire is unknown. Cause of fire unknown Yuna sent to ER The ambulance arrived 30 minutes ago. Has Taesan Group CEO Yim Tae-san arrived yet? We have yet to spot him at the scene. Yuna and Yim's marriage is just around the corner... Remember when Yim was tried for the first time? Key witness reversed his statement. Then someone else came forward and confessed. Yim would cover it up if we don't get there now. Excuse us. We're prosecutors! - It's over here. - I know. Let's take a look. Weren't you out on a retreat? Can you recover these? It's all gone. Completely hopeless. There, the wires. No security footages at all? There's nothing. Get the inside! Collect dash cams from nearby cars, and find any footages of the crime scene. Yes, boss. - Inspector. - Check, please. If they don't cooperate, file an official request! Got it, boss! Grab everything! Could you come out? Can I leave now? Mira. Yuna's dead. What happened between you two? You're suspecting me? Tell me. If you tell me the truth, I can get you out. But if you lie, I can't help you. Dickless fuck. You're doing this to me because of that slut? Fuck you! Memorial Service for Yuna Welcome. Defendant: Yim Mira Expected sentence: 15 years We'll push for alcohol incapacitation. That's not good enough to prove her innocence. We went through her room with Mr. Jung. Just in case. We need to consider all possibilities, like drug abuse to formulate a strategy. Also... there's something you need to see. This is Mira's laptop. We found something, it doesn't look good. Now? Hello... Get out. She's not dead yet. Complete the mission! I was only told about this, but never seen it. The prosecution will submit this game as evidence of willful negligence, and not an accident. Leak it on Facebook. Pardon? Leak it to the public. That'll put us at a major disadvantage. I got 85% stake of this game company. This scandal will substantially increase our paid users. Actually... do you know a lawyer named Choi Hee-jung? The kid can't pay the bill. She'll starve, who cares about legal proceedings? Then the lawyer... Hello, I'm Kim Hyung-mu from JP Law. One moment. Can I call you back? So tired... You brought beer! I got a visit from JP Law today. - They want to recruit me. - Seriously? What's this? Actually, it was about Mira. She's declining visitation. They want me to mother her. Mira? Yim Mira? Yim Mira? Yuna's murder case? - Yim Tae-san's kid? - Yup. Holy shit! Ms. Choi! Are you okay? I missed you so much. I can't remember anything, my head's all messed up. Am I a trending bitch on Facebook? Guess what I brought? Come sit. - Here. - Macaron. It's so good. Is this from my favorite bakery? Yup. I remembered our old days. Thank you. Here. It's the tea you liked. Thank you... It's hot, drink slow. So good. You look so frail. Over here please. First snow. Right. Ms. Choi. Mira continues to claim that she blacked out, do you believe her? Yes, of course. And I firmly believe that she's innocent of all charges. As of today, you are Mira's legal representative. Please do right by her. Do your best. Yes, sir... My daughter is not a murderer. What happened exactly? It was quite a stretch for the prosecution to detain my daughter without irrefutable evidence. We'll release Yim Mira's official statement at a later time. This is a simulation of the accident that killed Yuna. Pelvis and 5 rib fractures, and skull fracture after impact with the vehicle. The cause of death is heavy blood loss from the head injury by a blunt instrument. Who is Dong Sung-sik, Yuna's prosecutor? Some shitty comments on the Internet. The chief prosecutor's Dong? Yep. Is it there? No... Not yet. Courthouse Do you believe me? The prosecution requested to question the defendant, what is your intent? Under the circumstances, her testimony is very crucial. This could lead to coercion of testimony, and may be disadvantageous to the defendant. To verify the defendant's relation to the victim, we believe that defendant's testimony is required even if it may put her at a disadvantage. Defendant Yim Mira, come to the witness stand. Prosecution, your witness. Defendant, what was your relationship with late Park Yuna? None at all. Wasn't the victim your father's fiancee? I bet you detested the victim. Objection, conjecture, he's manipulating her emotions. Overruled, please continue. You didn't like Park Yuna? I didn't like her too much. - Enough to run her over? - Objection! Sustained, prosecution please be careful. Of course not... I understand. On the night of September 30 did you meet with Park Yuna? We were supposed to, so I went to her place, but I fell asleep while waiting for her. I can't remember anything afterwards. Can't remember? Very convenient. It's the truth... I don't like going to her place, so I waited in the parking lot, but she didn't show up, and I drank that night, so I was very sleepy. When I woke up, I was at dad's yacht club. So you don't remember those important hours? I request exhibit #8, please play. Play it please. Is this your vehicle? Yes, it is. Did you drive this vehicle in the early hours of October 1? I can't remember, I'm sorry... That is all. Defendant, did you kill Ms. Park Yuna? Objection! Sustained. Defense has the witness. Ms. Yim, how much did you drink that night? I had a few glasses of champagne with friends. Have you ever driven after drinking? No, when I drink, Mr. Jung picks me up. Then why did you drive yourself? Could you try to remember? I really can't remember. Your Honor. Prosecution's only evidence is my client's route. In the morning of October 1, 2016, it cannot be verified if she was behind the wheel. Mr. Jung Seung-gil normally drove her when she drank. That is all. This is the list of phone calls on the day of the accident. Mira in Gangnam texted Yuna in Yeoido. "We need to meet!" And 6 minutes later, she called Jung, to get her car. At 1:20 AM, Yuna texted her back near Club Octagon. When Mira didn't answer, Yuna went inside the club. At 3:05 AM, when Mira called near Yuna's home, it appears that Yuna went to the parking lot. So they met up at Octagon. - Yes, first rendezvous. - Then at Yuna's place? Yes, for the second time. Why? There's something interesting. This is Steve J. Park, Yuna's ex. He's an American handball player, they made a sex tape together. Mira's friends at the club testified that they saw it. Maybe they met again because of this. I solemnly swear that my testimony shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. At 1:45 AM, October 1, 2016, were you at Club Octagon in Gangnam? Yes. Is it true that you witnessed Yim Mira and Park Yuna fight in the washroom? Yes, I heard it all from the stall. I heard a familiar voice, so I had to check, and it was Yuna, I'm a fan of hers. See this? Fucking dirty. That was before I met your dad. That's your excuse? He knows about it, and you know what? He shares a lot of his concerns about you. He worries so much for you. The fuck he does. He said he raised you badly. That's right. What was it like to shoot this? Felt good? Blissful, even? Why are you so twisted? Be honest, you're past your prime, so you got your hooks on dad. And you? At least I don't make sex tapes like you. Shit, it was so fucking dirty. That's enough, Mira. Enough of what? Stop it. Stop what? Stop it, you fucking bitch! - Make me! - Fucking bitch! Fucking psycho! I'll kill you! Slut! Go ahead! Bitch. You're so fucking dead. Let go! Mira. Mira. Occupied It's a pearl that fell from the defendant's blouse. Is the person who claimed to have seen Yuna's sex tape present? Yes. Who was it? There. The woman who is accused. How did you find me? You brought an army of entourage? Prosecutor Dong. Can't you let my child go? Let her go? Bizarre rumors about Yuna are floating online. That's like killing her twice. So, love is more important than your daughter? For a week after her arrest, I received 16 calls to treat me to dinner. So I asked what for, and they couldn't answer. Mr. Dong. You can't live this world alone. Sure. As you move up the ladder, do you think you'll never call those 16 people for help? I gave them gifts they will not forget. That's why they all called you. That's how this world works. You should reach the top of the ladder. You can't reach that position all by yourself. It's not like you got a golden parachute. I'll buy you that. Buy what? The Prosecutor General's seat. I'm capable of it. You're a real psycho. Fuck, I lost my appetite. What do you take us for? Fuck you. Hello. Sir.. It must be difficult for Mira to see you. - Back? - Yeah. Visitation drains life force out of me. The criminals tend to suck you dry. I'm so tired... Listen. I found a person of interest linked to Yuna. "CableGuy" from her fan club. Take a look. So? Do you know how long it took me to find him? "CableGuy," Kim Dong-myung. He was caught illegally installing security cams near Yuna's office. But they settled that. Show me that. - The settlement? - Yeah. His shop is in Yongsan. - Yongsan? - Yeah, here. This is it. Eh? Damn. Always be happy, Yuna The person you're calling is not available... I waited all day, but nothing. I should head back. Yeah. Shit... Black jacket, you right there. Black jacket, please come out. Come on out. I can see you from here. But I didn't... Wait... Wait! Look at that, the car smashed through. I'm off, dude. Good work today. I put it in reverse, but it went forward. I braked, but it didn't work. It was an unintended acceleration. Dammit... Shit, fucking bastards... Mr. Chairman. Goddamn shit! Who smashes into a shop with a car to steal? Where's the stuff that was in here? If I took your stuff, would I still be here? Do you have footages of the accident? He's a borderline stalker. Are you really okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Mr. Kim Dong-myung. Just say the price. Do you really think money fixes everything? Money is everything. Money is not important to me! Then what is? Love. Family. Friends. When money runs out, they all leave. Bravo... Just like what I heard. If no one was watching, you wanted to toss her. Say what? I saw the footage of the accident. That's what Yuna said. "No wonder your father said so." Then Mira went batshit crazy with fire in her eyes, "What the fuck did he say, you fucking slut!" But Yuna stayed calm and classy, "If no one's watching, he wants to toss you," "that's what he said to me." You know what? Yuna hated your guts. "Don't you hate your dad? I hate him too." "I hate Yim Tae-san, he's a plaything to me." She couldn't stand you, she screamed and swore! I personally hate you too! You senile prick, know your place. Go home, Mr. Chairman. If you wanted to steal it, you should've done it quietly. Who fucking crashes into a store with a car? I don't believe this. Shit... My fiancee is dead. Not only that, my daughter is accused of her murder. I need to know what happened that day. Only then, I can send Yuna off properly. Hey! Hey! Chairman! Checking microphone. Mic test. Up to here! Shit... Media is corrupted Recover corrupted file Programs to recover corrupted videos Holy cow... Damn... Not up to it? Alright, demand number one. Yuna had a sweater with an owl in the middle. Go find it. It's white. Here. This is what she wore when I first met her. We took selfies and I got an autograph too. Demand number two. She was about to release a new single, I'll take that so don't release it. Of course. I'll get it from the recording studio server. Happy? Now, let's see the video. Of course you should. You definitely should. Well, how should I say... I'll love her everyday. Please... that's enough, okay? I promised you the song. You'll fuck me up once you get the video, no? I know it. Did I only say two demands? This isn't enough! You won't get the video. Blunt head trauma inflicted with fire extinguisher holder, and the massive blood loss were the cause of death. - Pass this over. - Yes. Tell us what the defendant was like when you arrested her. The defendant was heavily intoxicated. So there's a possibility that someone else was driving, and she got on the car drunk? I can't say for sure. Very reliable. Need to be in Thailand. Will contact later. - Tae-san Thank you. Good work today. Good evening. So? How's beer? Yeah, sure. Simba and Bongji fight so much. They must take after their owners. They do, indeed. Simba probably took... after you, and Bongji took after me. Like my kindness, so even if you nag, she just listens, but when she's had enough she loses her shit and bites Simba. Let's drink. Anyway, I'm going to go by the books. When did you not? That's been your problem. What I'm saying is, Can't you drop out? Drop out? This trial, of course. Why all of sudden? Do you think this case is right for you? Huh? Yim Tae-san is a vile man! Alright. He tried to buy me off. Why drop JP Law, and hire you? You talk so pretty. I hope you drop out of this. I'm only thinking out for you. No. I'm doing this. That stubbornness of yours. Yes? - Sir. - What's up. We got a call from Kim Dong-myung. What? He claims to have a video of Yuna's death, and he'd like to speak with you. Should I connect you? Of course. - Record it. - Okay. This is Dong Sung-sik. Look at the time! It's snowing outside. Were you with a guy? Which prick was it? Spill it. Like hell... Wait, wait! Why do you think I'm sitting like this? What is it? Okay. Look at this. I myself recovered all the files. - Amazing... - Look at this. This is the best I could recover. - That's Yuna? - Yeah. Case number 2016-620, we will now begin the hearing of Yim Mira. I solemnly swear that the evidence to be given by me shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Defense, your witness. What did you think of Park Yuna? I'm her fan too. Did you manage her schedule? Yes. You were practically her manager, what was working with her like? She was a nice person, and treated me well... What was her state when you found her in the parking lot? 10 minutes after I dropped off her stuff, I went down to the parking lot, and she was on the ground. And I smelled something burning. Have you... ever visited a luxury watch shop recently? I have something to tell you. Piaget dealer contacted me. A Piaget watch that I gave Yuna as a present was brought in by a man. According to the media, Yim Tae-san gifted Yuna a Piaget watch for birthday. It's worth about $500,000. Let me ask you again. After Park Yuna's death, have you called Piaget dealer to sell a watch? Someone attempted to sell a Piaget watch at a shop called Royal in Gangnam district. Piaget keeps track of their goods, so the watch couldn't be sold. Where's the watch now? I refuse to answer that. Mr. Jung. What did you do on the night of her death? You normally drove when the defendant drank. Did you also drive for her that night? Ms. Choi. Do you know Yuna well? Answer my question. Do you know her well? Did you drive that night? I asked you a question, do you? Answer my question! I also asked you a question! Answer me! I'm the only one who fucking knew her! Sit down! - What happened that night?! - I'm the only one! Only I knew her true nature! Fuck, even he didn't know shit! - So did you kill her? - Yes! - Your Honor! - I killed her! Inappropriate questioning! I killed her! - Sustained! - Fuck, I did it! Please sit! She was a crazy bitch. She was a fucking whack! That bitch... Let go! Let go of me. What did I tell you? Why didn't you listen to me? That is all. Return to your seat. If you disturb the courtroom again, you'll be held in contempt. Anything that is said by the witness can be used as evidence. We'll conduct a psych evaluation and act accordingly. Cross-examine please. Mr. Jung. Yes? What do you think of Chairman Yim? He's my savior. How much did he pay you? Are you taking the fall for him? Objection! Argumentative. Sustained, your questions must be based on facts. My apologies. Let's look at the facts. According to forensics, Jung's fingerprints were found at parking lot security room. However, even though he confessed, I'll put that aside for now. At least until watching Kim Dong-myung's video. Your Honor. I request a new key witness, Kim runs Yuna's fan club and is a security camera installer. A new key witness? Is he here now? Yes. Your Honor. My witness has not arrived yet. What's going on here? My apologies. On what grounds are you requesting... Kim is a pivotal witness, it won't take long. You can't ignore courtroom protocols. Please, Your Honor. Go back to your seat. Jung Seung-gil, you may step down. We accept prosecution’s request for a new key witness. But you get 20 minutes. I can't give you anymore. We recess for 20 minutes. What happened? More evidence... I'm talking about Kim Dong-myung! What's the problem? He has the footage of the accident. So? Don't you see? Stop him. He absolutely cannot testify, don't you get it? Your inadequacy is beyond belief. Jung Seung... I was certain he was the perpetrator. Kim has to be stopped. Imagine what Mira's life will be like after this. Yes? I got it. He's in the parking lot. I'll kidnap him if I have to, buy me 5 more minutes. Mr. Chairman... I told you. Jung was bought off to take the fall. - He's a puppet. - Have you been well? What? What are you talking about? Piaget, confession, what else do you need? The actual footage! Sir, Kim's here. But Kim Dong-myung! Look, Mr. Kim! We didn't agree to this! What are you talking about? Look here! What do you want? Money? Or Yuna's entire wardrobe? Take them all! I told you it's not about the money. Look. Wait a minute! Can I ask you what this is about? Go away! It's okay. Listen to me. Don't do this. It feels like we're running in circles, I'll be on my way. Hey! I'll pay you! A sum you've never seen in your life! Money comes before pride! You're petty. What did you say? You perverted bastard! Like hell I am! Go away! Huh? Who are you? What's happening? Listen to me, it's your last chance. Give me the flash drive. Now. Get him! Let me go! You can't do this to me! Let go! - Get me the prosecutor! - Sir, you can't do this! The real killer is in there! You're being lied to! It's all a lie! Let go, son of a bitch! Give me that. Give it. - What is this? - Come on. What's in here? Give it to me! Stop! How could you do this? Let's go upstairs, we got a trial to finish. Is Jung the real killer? Does it feel good to meet your old lover? Stay on course, Ms. Choi! Do what you're paid to do! How about we hear from Kim at the next hearing? Just a little longer, Your Honor. Could I have a moment? What's there to talk about right now? Was Kim supposed to bring you a video? Yes. I know where it is. What? Yim Tae-san has it, in his coat pocket. My apologies, Your Honor, we'd like to amend request for a new key witness. There's new witness who holds the truth. Who are you referring to? We'd like to put Yim Tae-san on the stand. Any objections from the defense? No objections. Very well, your request has been granted. Mr. Yim Tae-san. Please come to the witness stand. Please stand up. Swear in please. I solemnly swear that the evidence to be given by me shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Please sit down. Prosecution, your witness. Your Honor. This witness is carrying a flash drive that contains a video. The evidence Kim was supposed to present here, was forcibly taken from him by this witness. We're in the process of obtaining a search warrant for this witness. I am only interested in the flash drive he possesses. Until the said warrant arrives, I'll keep him on the stand. But I won't ask any questions. Search Warrant Request You expect me to issue you this warrant? Please help us this once! Prosecutor! We got the search warrant. Your search warrant has been issued. Mr. Yim, please stand up with your hands raised. Witness! We'd like to enter this flash drive as a key evidence. Defense, what do you say? No objections, Your Honor. Very well, request accepted. Please play the video. Mira! Mira! Officer! Help! The murder of Park Yuna, began with a sex tape made by her with her ex-lover. It appears that upon this discovery, Yim Tae-san couldn't contain his rage and brutally murdered her. Witness. Would you like to respond? Your Honor, Prosecutor Dong, and dear Ms. Choi. Do you know what my job is? I'm a broker. I turn a critical situation into an opportunity. Framed my own daughter? That's your limit. When I'm tossed in jail, how will my daughter, whose head is only filled with undying thirst for money, ever protect me? And who will feed Taesan Group's employees, all 2,078 of them and their families? She deserved to die! Not all lives in this world are equal! Stupid idiots. Know what the essence of this case is? Saying that nothing can be done, that's an excuse said by those who failed. Anything else? Keep going. Let it all out! We should not forgive Yim Tae-san. I request to have him arrested immediately. Let's go. Mr. Dong, congrats. This trial is adjourned. All rise! Truth Law Firm LLC I heard the lawyer here is inconceivably beautiful. Thank you. - A cup of tea? - Sure thing. Cold water, actually. Sure. Nice, very nice. Here. I believed in you. What? I honestly only believed in you on this case. Know that? I wouldn't have trusted Yim, even if he brought it himself. It's all thanks to you. Who is it? We've met before. I'm from JP Law. We'd like you to be Yim Tae-san's counsel. I thought I was dreaming, so I had to come see you. Shouldn't you apologize for using me to frame Mr. Jung? I'm sorry. But does an apology change anything? Did you need that? It doesn't cost a cent, so I'll apologize again. I'm sorry. Ms. Choi. Let's think realistically. Now that you've started your own firm, you'll need capital immediately. Rent to pay, clerks to pay. Represent me. I'd like to receive the best legal counsel. You lie with every breath. Just once, tell me the truth. Why did you hire me to represent Mira, and why did you ask for me? If you sign that, I'll tell you. I won't do my best to represent you. By this, we are bound by attorney-client privilege. It goes without saying. Thank you. Feed yourself and clean after yourself. Live properly now. And stop whining, even if you did, you got no one left to help you. Call me for emergencies. And dad? Let me meet him. No more nonsense, and stay quiet. Dad murdered her? The girl in the video, I could tell that wasn't me. So? So what? Huh? Go on. Please help me. As a last favor. Mira, it's too much for you. I can take it. Come in. I need your help. No call records, empty address book, no documents. What is this photo? 313 Brana Road, Bangkok. He had a business trip to Thailand during your trial. Ms. Choi. Huh? Please, let's leave. Mira. Let's go see your dad. Take your belongings and go this way. You look thin. What am I supposed to say? Should I apologize? Or thank you? What should I do? Live to the fullest. Just live well. Don't worry about money. Stop it. Now that I think about it, I got all the money in the world, but it's the last thing you need. Stop it, dad. You called me dad. I went to Thailand. It's hot there, right? You didn't do this. You shouldn't drink anymore. You talk gibberish when you drink. Stop drinking, okay? It's my fault. It's all my fault, dad. I'm so sorry. Guard, I'm done here. No, don't go, dad! Don't go! Will you come back? Don't cry. I'll miss you, visit often. Dad... The trial is about to begin! All members of the media must leave the courtroom. One moment. Sorry, play please. Come to your senses, Mira! Fuck you! Mira! Mr. Kim, please help me. You have to help me. Blame me. It's all because of me... I'll take the punishment... Okay. Dong knows me more than anyone. If I hand over the evidence, he'll suspect it. I need you to call him yourself. Say that you have irrefutable evidence. Look at this, we came so far. If we stop now, everything will go to waste. I can't make that call, that's too much. - Please. - Hello? I'm calling, let's say I did. I have an important evidence concerning Yuna's case. Okay. I'd like to speak to Mr. Dong Sung-sik. Okay. This fits. My mom's a size smaller. Could I buy the first pair I tried from you? Tell her not to worry, after the shoot I'll give everything here as presents. - Everything here? - Yes. Thank you, thank you! Stand up, please. Turn around. That will do. How's her condition today? She's good. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm alright. I'm so sorry.
