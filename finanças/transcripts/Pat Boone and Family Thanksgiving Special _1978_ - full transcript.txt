[music playing] - Oh, hey! Hi. It's me, Pat Boone, the artful jogger. Just trying to wake my blood up a little bit. You know, I got to be the happiest man alive tonight, doing a Thanksgiving special with the people I love. And if I may say so, I do have a terrific family to be thankful for. Just in case you don't know, a wonderful wife named Shirley who really keeps me in shape; four beautiful daughters. Cherry is the oldest, and she's married and mature. There's Lindy. She's also married, and she's made me mature: a granddaddy, twice. And there's Debby. And, of course, I guess you know she sings a little bit. And there's Laury, the youngest. In fact, she's three years younger than the eldest, and the others are never going to let her live it down. Actually, I think they get along very well. LINDY: Debby, that's my hair dryer you're using. - So we hope that you'll share the joy and the laughter as well as-- DEBBY BOONE: Oh, no. Yours is the pink one with "Star" written on it. - --the tender moments. - Pat, I think you better come inside. It's the girls. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard. Will you give me just a few minutes folks? I got to go in and lay a little tenderness on the girls. And we'll have a lot of fun. [music playing] DICK TOEFL: It's "Pat Boone and Family: A Thanksgiving Special." Starring Pat and Shirley Boone, with Cherry, Lindy, Laury, and Debby Boone. With guest stars John Byner, the Hudson Brothers, Harry Lang as Joey the bartender, and special guest star Bob Hope. - Just what I need for more energy. - Aha! Let me guess. You're going to donate that to Weight Watchers? - One slice won't hurt me. After all, I'm jogging. It'll go right through me like putting water in a steam engine. - Yeah, well, steam engines don't have to wear a size 10 dress. - 9. - Whatever. - I'll split it with you. - Laury. - OK. What would I do without you? - Oh, I figure about two slices a day. - You sure you don't mind being left alone here, Daddy? - Oh no. - Yeah, we'd all be happy to stay here and keep you company. - Oh, I know you would. But I'll be fine, girls. You just go ahead and enjoy the movie. I think I'll just read a little bit till the Hudson Brothers get here. - The Hudson Brothers?! - I didn't tell you? Oh, I invited them over. I'm going to ask them to do this charity benefit with me. - Oh, we saw them on TV. They're really great guys. - A little eccentric maybe, but great guys. - They've got a real crazy sense of humor. - And they're very good looking. - Very good looking. You know, daddy, I think maybe I should stay behind and introduce you. - Oh, no, Laury. No, I'm perfectly capable of introducing myself, no matter how eccentric they are. Fact is I've got kind of a crazy sense of humor myself. - Believe me, daddy, it's not the same. They're really bonkers. - Well, don't worry about it. I can take care of myself. Besides, I've got business to talk about with them, you know, so-- - OK, daddy. - Thank you, Laury. - See you later. - Your loss. - Go ahead and enjoy the movie. Tell Lassie hi for me. Be back by 9:00. [doorbell chiming] Hi, I'm Pat. - Hi! We're the Hudsons. - Come in. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Been expecting you. - Well, you guys are a little early. I guess you caught a tailwind, uh? Well, look, come on in. Sit down. - Thank you. - So you're the Hudsons. - Yep. That's us. All three of us. - In the flesh. - And we know your daughters. - You know, they have a crazy sense of humor. - And they're a little eccentric maybe, but-- - They're very good looking. - You noticed. Hey, you look a little uncomfortable. Can I get you a glass of milk? A sandwich? Uh, corn? - No, thanks. We're stuffed. - Yeah. How about some peanuts? - Oh, thank you! - That's terrific. Hey, didn't I see you guys in Farmer's Market or somewhere? You're the Hudsons, huh? - Yeah. That's us. - And you're Pat Boone. - Yeah. You know for a minute there we didn't recognize you in that crazy outfit. - My crazy outfit? Just my relaxing outfit. - Relax. Relax. - I am. I am. - So you wanted to see us. - Look, I'm not too familiar with you guys but I know you're terrific. - Oh, pshaw. - My daughters told me you're great with the chicks and really terrific. I know. And listen, I'm doing a charity show, and I thought maybe-- - Hey, Pat, if it's charity, we're interested. - Absolutely. - Right. What does it pay? - Chicken feed. Sorry. - Look, Pat. I know we've got this zany reputation. But that's just on our television series. You know, off stage we're just regular, ordinary, dull people just like you. - You know, we've got to be ourselves sometimes. - And we wanted you to see that real side of us. - Could you guys maybe give thought to a pilgrim sketch? You know, that might be funny. - Hey, well, how does it go? - What? - The pilgrim sketch? - I don't know. I just thought of it. You know, I don't have a punchline yet. Why don't you guys maybe come out dressed as pilgrims? - Oh, you mean with those black hats? - Yeah. - And in those long black coats. - Right. - And wearing those knickers? - Exactly. - Are you crazy? - You think we'd come out here dressed like that? - And make fools of ourselves? - I can't believe it! - Listen, Mr. Boone. It's been nice meeting you. And if we don't see you again, so what? [barking] - Gee, I didn't mean to ruffle their feathers like that. I said that. - Hey, Joey, how you doing? - Oh, hi, Mr. Boone! - Gee, why so excited? This is the closest I've ever seen you come to perspiration. - Well, I am excited because I'm meeting somebody very special here tonight. - Gotcha, Mr. Boone. Gotcha. - You don't understand, Joey. I'm talking about Hope. I'm hoping a little myself, Mr. Boone. - Bob Hope. Look, don't tell anybody, but he's coming here, just any minute, and I think he's going to invite me on his Christmas tour. - His Christmas tour? - Yeah. - Are we at war again? - Joey. - Just kidding, Mr. Boone. No, really, that must be quite an honor. - Oh, it's a great honor. I mean he only invites the biggest stars on his Christmas tour. - That's great! What can I get you Mr. Boone? - Well, I think it's a big night. I want something to put hair on my chest. - Why-- why don't you just stop shaving it, Mr. Boone? - Well, you just get me the usual. - Right, right. - I think I need a little music in here. Let's see. Oh, hey. [MUSIC - PAT BOONE, "APRIL LOVE"] [SINGING] April love is for-- - Hey, listen to that Joey. There's not a scratch on it. - That's because nobody ever played it, Mr. Boone. - Holy, skemolies! There's Bob Hope! - Hey, I might have known Boone would be in a place like this. There's a cop outside checking your breath for curdling. - Bob, I'm so glad you could come. - How are you? - Glad you found the place. - Well, could I miss it? There's a butter slick in the street. Yes. They're playing my favorite golf song. - Your favorite golf song? - Yes, just a little below par. - Well, it's always kept me in the green. Why don't you sit down? - You almost shanked that, didn't he? - Oh, Mr. Hope. Gee, you know, you're one of my favorite people? Anything on that menu is yours. - He's out, huh? Do you have anything on here that's bad for you? - I could give you some milk in a dirty glass. - I got to hand it to you, Pat. I'd never have a kid that funny on my show. Yeah, I guess so. I hear you've been pretty busy, huh? - Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a Thanksgiving special. You know what that's like. And then later, I'm going to do an Easter special, but Christmas is wide open. - Ah, that's great. Now you can spend more time with your family. Unfortunately, I have to work. - Oh, well, I get to spend lots of time with my family, Bob. And you know, I just love to work. - Then how about filling in for me Christmas Day? - Joey, no, no. I think I'm going to be doing a little traveling this Christmas. - Yeah, me too. I'm going on tour. - Your tour-- your regular Christmas tour! Why sure. Where is it start? - Well, I'm going to start down South. - Oh, that's where I was born. - Then I'm working up the East Coast. - That's where I got started. - We're flying to the Orient. - I love rice. - Yeah, you'd probably buy Uncle Ben's and convert it yourself. - Gee, Mr. Hope, you're really funny. God, I wish I was going on that tour. - I'm sorry, kid. I really came here to ask Pat if I could take Debby with me. - Bob, of course... Debby? - Yeah, you know, "You Light Up My Life"? Little blonde, real cute? - You know, Mr. Boone. Blue eyes, white teeth. - Clam up, curdle breath. Debby? - Yeah. Pat, I hope you don't mind. - Mind? Of course not. Do I look like I mind? - Well, the last time I saw anybody that upset, they were handed a blindfold and a cigarette. - No, no. Of course, I don't mind. I mean, if Debby wants to go, she can go. I mean, she'll be thrilled. - He's right, Mr. Hope. She'd do anything to get out of that house. - Will you go slurp a straw? - I have to go, Pat. I'm in a rented car, and if I don't have it back soon, OJ Simpson drives me to the airport and jumps over my body. - Well, thank you again, Bob. - Good to see you. - Love you, love you, Mr. Hope. - Well, I guess I better get on home. I want to watch Debby pack. - Sure. - Love you, love you, Mr. Boone. - Sure. Ah, this is it. I'm a goner. Last will and testament time, I know. - Pat, I'm tense. I hate to see you like this. You're going to get wrinkles. - But Shirley's going to kill me. The last thing she said before I drove out was "take care of my car." And I bring it back with this big dent in the fender. Gosh darn it. I'm sorry, John, excuse the language. - Oh, that's OK. I was in the Navy. - Oh, but what am I going to do, John? What's Shirley going to say? - She's going to say, "Do you always squint when you overact? - John, I'm serious. I'm in trouble. I'm really in trouble. - Oh, come on, Pat. It's not like your tan is starting to fade. - My tan is starting-- - Pat, Patty, Patrick, Pat, listen. I'm trying to give you advice. I'm your next door neighbor. Relax. - Relax? Could you relax if you've just been in a car wreck? I was just in a wreck 30 minutes ago. And the thing is Shirley did the same thing to my car six months ago. - Well, then you've got nothing to worry about. - Oh no, no. I yelled at her. I screamed at her. She's going to kill me when she finds out. And she's got a right to. - Ah, let me think. Hold it. I've got it. - What? - Lie. - Oh, no way. - Fabricate. - Impossible. - Embellish. - Uh-huh. - OK. How about fib? - There is a difference. - Yeah. Bad guys lie. Cute guys fib. It wasn't your fault. The accident wasn't your fault. - It wasn't my fault? I was driving! - But the way the other guy was parked! So arrogant. It was an accident waiting to happen. - Why to me? - Oh, OK. Come on, Pat. Sit down. Sit down. Relax. This is what we're going to tell her, OK? We're going to tell her we were driving along Hollywood Boulevard on our way to make a donation to the Salvation Army. That's it, the Salvation Army. - Yeah, yeah. - Right? Get her sympathy, right? - Yeah, OK. - OK. So we're driving along and this elderly lady crosses the street. - Oh, yes. - This very elderly lady. I'm talking major elderly. Now, she's got a dog and a broken leg. - Wait a minute. The lady had a broken leg or the dog? - Both. So you had to think quick. You turned suddenly. - To avoid the old lady? - No. - The dog? - No. The priest. - The priest? I didn't see any priest. - Exactly! And if it hadn't been for that skateboard. - There was a kid on the skateboard? - No, the priest. - There was a kid on the priest? - No. The priest was on a skateboard. That's when you avoided the runaway shopping cart and ran into the parked car. - Oh, John. No, thanks. Yeah, you're a real pal. I appreciate it. But, no, it would never work. I'm just going to have to be honest because around our house, if you have anything to say you just say it. - Hi, fellows! - Oh, hi-- uh, uh-- - Shirley. - Shirley. I know what it is. - Honey, well, I-- uh, I was driving down Hollywood Boulevard. You know, in your car? - My car? - Yeah. And there was this elderly lady. I mean, major elderly lady. And she was on her way to the Salvation Army to make a donation-- - Hey, what are you doing here anyway? I thought you had the bathroom next. - I do. My luck, I'm following Debby. She's been in there over an hour already. Be glad you caught her on a fast day. - Hi, guys. - All that time for that? - What time for what? - The time you spent in the bathroom getting ready? - I wasn't in there. - I thought you were. I knocked on the door and I could hear was the sound of that old hair dryer. It's been going on for 20 minutes. - I wonder who it could be. - Hi, girls. Through with the bathroom now in case anybody wants to use it. I think one of you should. [music - pat and shirley boone] [SINGING] I shut off the heat. I put out the cat. Did everything that you said. I'm dead on my feet. Too tired to chat. So please, let's go to bed. Say, honey-- I'm trying to sleep. You know what? I'm sure it'll keep. The price of a turkey's inflated. You're making me weep. Everything's almost twice. I know. They've just doubled the price. I know. Go to sleep. But my dear! Go to sleep. My dear. Go to sleep. Oh, darling. I need all my rest. Please listen. I'm doing my best. I just love the way Debby's singing. We sure have been blessed. She's sincere can be. I know. Get's her talent from me. Uh-oh. Go to sleep. But my dear. Go to sleep. Oh, come on, honey. Go to sleep. Do you still feel the old attraction. Hmm. A fraction. Huh. You don't say. Well, it still seems odd to woo a grandma. But you're a grandpa. Touche. Dear Patrick. You're formal, my dear. I love you. I'll stand up and cheer. We really have cause for Thanksgiving. Each day of the year. I'm so glad I'm your wife. I know. Because you light up my life. I know. Go to sleep. My dear. Go to sleep. Come on, Pat. Go to sleep. It's suddenly late. Just look at the clock. The hour hand is starting to creep. Chatting can wait. We're both close to shock. I guess we should go to sleep. Hey, Shirley. I'm drifting away. You know what? It's been a long day. I'm suddenly feeling romantic. I'll see you in there. You can't treat me like this. I know. All I want is a kiss. I know. Go to sleep, honey. What? Go to sleep. But my dear. Sleep. Hey, sweetheart. I'm starting to nod. I love you. Now isn't that odd. I thank all the stars that I met you. My own thanks to god. You're the one I adore. I know. More than Zsa Zsa Gabor. I know. Go to sleep, honey. Huh? Go to sleep. But honey. Go to sleep. Hey, I heard about a new milk diet. Well, do try it. Me try it. Oh, not that. But dear, your suits are all divulging. My suits? You're bulging. Oh, no, not that. Pat. Hey, Shirley. It's too much to take. I love you. Then give me a break. I'm so glad it's you that I married. OK. I'm awake. You can go back to sleep. Oh, no. Nah, you were right. It can keep. Oh no. Go to sleep. But my dear. Go to sleep. Come on, Pat. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to [snore] sleep. - Hi. - Hi. - Did you get little Ryan's birthday present yet? - Just about to wrap it. You get yours yet? - Yeah. Want to see? - Sure. It happens every time. I said we should go shopping together. But, no, you wanted to go alone. - I remember the last time we went shopping together for a present for daddy and ended up fighting over the same thing. - You still won. You got to get him the Bee Gee's album, not me. - Laury, I told you that you can borrow it anytime you want, just ask me. - Hey, it's almost time. You guys got your gifts wrapped yet? - We're getting there. - Well, what did you get him anyway? - We chipped in and got him a set of basketballs. - Basketballs come in sets? I only got him one. [music - boone sisters] [SINGING] Family tree, the family tree, daddy says that there have the famous Boones down through history. If daddy says it, there is no doubt. So stick around a while, we know you're bound to find out. It's plain to see we all agree. There were very many famous Boones in our family tree. If daddy tells us about some guy who was a famous captain, well, our daddy don't lie. - Captain John Smith Boone. - Let us all toast this first winter's harvest with a hearty thanksgiving. To Thanksgiving. Oh, yes, farkleberry wine. - Remember that boat we came here on? - Oh, yes. The Mayflower. - That's the one. - Whatever became of it? - I sold it to the Puritans as a theme park. 'Tis right next to Six Witches Over Salem. - Thank goodness for that old boat. It got us out of Holland. - Yes, Holland was pretty rough. I didn't think we'd ever escape our Dutch masters. - Yes, they came close, but no cigar. And now my children, enough jocularity. We have a special treat for thee. As a token of our goodwill toward our neighbors, to wit we have invited Chief Eagle Beak to address us on this occasion. Chief? - How. Hi. This is Chief Eagle Beak. Keep your hands off my land. I'm still waiting for the second payment for New York. Happy and wonderful that you're here, right here in-- Plymouth, Mass. I'd give you the zip code but it's on my other coat. How about these pilgrims, huh? You know we have an old saying: :Give a pilgrim an inch and he'll make Rhode Island." I don't know what that means yet but it's on Roger William's next album. I had a terrible week. Changed tribes three times this week. Went from Navajo to Arapaho to Texaco. And I want to congratulate the captain who landed his boat on Plymouth Rock. I know what to get him for Christmas: a pair of glasses. Thank you, pilgrims. Well, I got to go now. It's my wife's bowling night I have to babysit with a papoose. And if you need any more corn, I'll be in my wigwam. Just look for the sign that says, "Chief Eagle Beak, Used Corn Dealer." [SINGING] The family tree, the family tree. Daddy says that there have been famous Boones down through history. If daddy says it, then daddy's right. So join us because we're going to the movies tonight. Rudolph Boonentino. [yawning] [piano music] [SINGING] The family tree, the family tree. Daddy says that there have famous Boones down through history. If daddy says it, then it's a fact. So take a trip with us to catch his magic act. - Harry Boondini. - But please, Mr. Feynman, I swear we've-- we've worked on some new tricks and they're terrific. - Really. - Can't get a worse magician in the world. And if it wasn't for your rabbits, you'd starve to death. - Mr. Feynman, we came all the way from New York. You promised us a job. - Yeah. - All right. I'll tell you what. If the elephant gets sick, you're hired. OK? - Mr. Feynman, the elephant died. - Not sick enough. - But Mr. Feynman, we got this sensational new trick. Boondini saws me in half. - What? Impossible. - But-- but darling, we haven't perfected that one yet. - Oh, I trust you, honey. You can do it. - Boondini, if you pull this one off, you're going to make a million bucks. - Well, we'll try, sir. - Then I'd better give you a proper introduction. All right. Let's hear it for Goldberg and his Flying Knives. Ladies and gentlemen, I got some bad news and some bad news. The elephant is dead. But Boondini isn't. So it gives me an awful bunch of indigestion to introduce to you Harry Boondini. [boos] - For my final trick-- [cheers] --curtain. Ah. I will attempt to saw my lovely assistant in half. The saw, please. Please pray, dear. - Yeah. - You're the most beautiful girl I ever saw. - Tell the ambulance not to leave with the elephant yet. - Are you all right? Here we are. And now, we'll just-- just remove this and pull that apart. [applause] - He did it! He actually did it! The guy did it! - Sweetheart, we did it. - Thanks to your faith in me, dear, we're going to make millions! Millions! Let's go celebrate. [SINGING] It's plain to see we all agree. There were many cuckoo gooney Boones in our family tree. We hope you dug it and had some fun. And if you did, we hope you'll be here next time when we check our tree here because daddy says his family includes everyone. You know, I said I was a family man, and this is a very special night for our family. You're going to meet five generations of us-- Shirley's grandmother, my mom and dad from Nashville, the Mrs. and me, our four lovely daughters, Cherry's husband Dan, and of course Lindy's little Ryan and Jessica. They're making our house a home this Thanksgiving. [MUSIC - BOONE FAMILY, "BLESS THIS HOUSE"] [SINGING] Bless this house, O Lord, we pray. Make it safe by night and day. Bless these walls so firm and stout. Keeping want and trouble out. [MUSIC - BOONE FAMILY, "LOVE IN A HOME"] [SINGING] You can tell when you open the door. You can tell when there's love in a home. Every table and chair seems to smile. Do come in, come and stay for awhile. You are almost feel you've been there once before. By the shine and the glow of the room. And the clock seems to chime come again any time. You'll be welcome whereever you roam. You can tell when there's love in the home. Good night, sweet child, when there is love in a home. - Time to carve the turkey. - Yes, it is. Now, let me see. Dr. Carver at your service. Well, that's our show for this evening, folks. I hope we made it as special for you as you have for us. Honey, you've done it again. It's a great turkey. We want to thank our guests, good neighbor, John Byner; the quiet, sophisticated Hudson Brothers; and of course our special guest and good friend Bob Hope. Now, before we leave, I'd like to say that there's something we feel real strongly about at the Boone house and that's love and togetherness of family and friends. That's really what we're all about. And we thank you for letting us share that with you tonight. So, good night, everybody, and Happy Thanksgiving. NARRATOR: "Pat Boone and Family: A Thanksgiving Special."
