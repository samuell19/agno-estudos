Let's prepare your surgery. I'm Annie Price and I've lived my whole life with burn scars. I've had many operations on my face, but all were for medical necessity. And where would you do that, across the bridge? Yeah. Now I'm older and more confident, I'm thinking about having my nose done, but just for looks. Short nose can be released in some degree. I'm in Seoul, South Korea. This is a city where 60% of people in their 20s have had plastic surgery. Hi, you OK? I want to find out what some of the best plastic surgeons in the world would recommend for me. This lady is having her nose done, this could literally be me on here. All in the name of beauty. I was burnt in a caravan fire when I was about three or four weeks old. I had third-degree burns on my whole face, my head, both my hands and my arm. So I had splints on my hands 'cause my hands didn't move. They didn't think I'd write so I'm really lucky that I can. I've always had to moisturise a lot and my mum really had to do all the heavy work. And she had to moisturise and bend the fingers round every single day, twice a day. Doing that on a child is quite painful so I was crying so it must have been horrible for her. So surgery I have had done, obviously had the surgery that saved my life and all the skin grafts that obviously allowed me to move my face at all. My mum helped me make most of those decisions 'cause I was quite young. You know, she sort of had the conversations with the doctors, Can we ever make Annie look, I know I'm not really supposed to use this word, but normal. And they said, "No." I've looked at doing the top of my nose. I would like to probably try the top of my nose. But we'll see, we'll see. - Hello. - Hello. How you doing? Did I see you downstairs? Um, no I don't think so. How you doing? As a child, I had more than a dozen operations on my face. Most of them were performed by reconstructive surgeon, Mr David Gault. I haven't seen him for more than 15 years. And how's life? Really good, I can't complain, I'm very happy. So how has it all been? Have you had lots of operations recently? I hadn't had anything for about, let me think, about 12... 10, 12 years. The last one that we did together with the eye and then I've just recently had like zigzag cuts in my nose, 'cause that was really webbed. Oh, right. Yeah, that's a good plan. Yeah and I've just started doing loads of laser work. You know like the six kind of needles, like choo, choo, choo. Lots of little penetrating things. Yes, that one. I've had that probably about four or five times. - And you like that? - I love that, yeah. 'Cause your face is looking good. It feels so good. I've got some slides here, of an operation we did together. Ah wow, there's loads of them. And that's a picture of you when you were two. Ah, look at my little face. Ahh, look at my little Jackson 5 afro. I've got a massive head, I don't need to see that now I'm about to have a baby. That's your ear all pulled forward and sticking out and shaped like a little cup. God, it was so far out. Look at me, little Dumbo, - And you can see... And we flattened it out and put that fold in and moved it back a long way. That looks so good. That's how it ended up. Such a neat ear. Do you still look at that now and think, "Yeah, I'm chuffed with that?" Well, that's why you're in my collection... Oh, am I in the Hall of Fame? ...Of people who've worked. Of course, no-one's going to show a bad testimonial, are they? I'm thinking about having my nose done, just dropping the tip down a little bit. Um, what do you think? If you really want it, do it, and do it as safely as you can. But as far need goes, you don't need surgery. Thanks. What is it about you that's prompted you to think of further refinements? I think I'm just happier in the way that I didn't use surgery at all, kind of ignored it for about 12 years and since getting back into it, I have actually felt physically better so literally from having the nose done, I didn't realise how much I was turning my head to look at things. I can see from all angles, which sounds ridiculous to say, but it's, yeah it's nice, my face feels a lot freer. See, it's not just a shape thing then, is it? It's an actual vision thing. Yeah. First of all, don't make up your mind in a hurry, and always take the advice of the people near you, you trust. Yeah, you're completely right. Yep. Lovely. I live with cats, Bobbie and Batman and fiance Sam, just outside London. We've been together for five years and are expecting our first baby. So is this your... Are you actually packing them? Yeah, of course I'm packing. These are really comfy, how cute are these? But look, I actually bought them in a size six - and I'm like a four. - Too big? Yeah, it's 'cause everyone kept saying, "Oh you're pregnant, you know, your feet are going to swell." I was like, I'll be walking round, I'll want... You could wear your shoes inside the shoes. How do you feel about me having like another nose surgery? I literally don't care. - Um, care a little bit. - How about that? That's how I feel. You need to care, care a little bit. I mainly care about your recovery, like are you going to be OK afterwards? So you're saying you don't care because you love me so much that you think I'm beautiful as I am, is that what you meant to say? I think if I cared that much about if you had a nose or not, we wouldn't be getting married in few months' time. That's true. Oh, that's true. So, if you want to get a nose, that is fine. But what if I have it done and it looks worse? Um, well it's your decision what you do with your own nose. Yeah, you're right, thanks. It would be nice to have a nose. Yes, it would be nicer to have a nose for you. Not that it's no nose, just a little nose, it looks a country mile better than it did. I'm also scared though I'm going to get there and they're gonna say, "Eugh, how have you lived like this?" "Why have you not done this sooner?" They probably will. I think they will, I think they'll be like, "Really, the nose, is that all we're going to go for?" "I think we should do this, this this and this." - Hiya. - Hi, hello. How are you, my dear? I'm really good, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Look at this! I know. My mum Maggie adopted me when I was six. She's always brought me up to be comfortable with how I look. I'm not sure why you want to have surgery now. I'm not sure why... What's brought it up now all these years later? I think I feel more comfortable, I'm a lot more confident about how everything is. I'm having a baby now and life's going to get more hectic. And I'd rather do it sooner rather than later because I don't want my children to be, like, "Oh. Mum's changed", as much. I don't think... I know it won't be a thing, I know it won't big thing and it won't change that much but I just, I don't want it to be something that they have to deal with. When you were little, there was a lot of stuff the surgeons could have done, but I didn't want you to have to grow up from a very young age and keep thinking, "I've got to have my face, "It's got to look like everybody else's" "or I can't go out." But I would be uneasy if you were to keep having little bits and pieces done. But, well it's not my decision, it's your decision. It's not my decision at all, I'm just saying as your mother, how it would make me feel. Yeah. It's not my decision at all, I'd support you, whatever you do, but, don't always have to like our offspring's decisions. Unfortunately not, in a kinder way. Not everything's for comfort, some of the things I'd like to do just for a look. I don't think that's a bad thing, I don't think it can impact my happiness, I don't think I'm going to be a better person when I have it, I just think I might feel and look better. Those are the only two reasons you should have a surgery. So I think that I'm the ideal candidate. Yeah, that's a good point, that's a really good point. - Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. I just want to make sure that you're comfortable, and that you're not gonna do things that are going to set you on a path to being unhappy. She's my baby, you know, my youngest child. Favourite child. No, no, no... Sorry, Mum, it's on camera, favourite child. You're my favourite adopted child or you're my favourite youngest daughter. She's diplomatic this one. Yeah, got to be. No favourites in our house. And your baby will be... Mum, you can see it in your eyes, OK. ...My favourite second grandchild. The eyes don't lie, right? You can say all the nice things you want. You are my favourite youngest daughter or favourite adopted child. Whichever one you like. So there. Seoul, South Korea, the global capital of plastic surgery. People come here from all over the world to be operated on. And Koreans have had more procedures than anyone. An amazing one in five of the population have had some sort of plastic surgery. The doctors here specialise in facial surgery, so it's the ideal place to see what they could do for me. I'm here in the famous Gangnam district, known as the beauty belt of Seoul. In this neighbourhood alone there are more than 400 plastic surgery clinics. And there's a plastic surgery clinic here. I can see all the ones already from here down there. There's some more coming up. It's crazy, 'cause they're huge. They're doing really well obviously, big businesses. It's crazy how it's so tight and it's all dense in one little area. They're almost like they want it to be like, "Come here, there's all this", in one spot. I'm wondering just how many people here have actually had their faces done. Jung eun, what was excuse me again? Can I? One second, one second. No? No. Awkward. One second. Do you know many people that have had plastic surgery? Nose. Excuse me. You obviously don't need it all, both of you but would you ever consider having surgery done yourself? You have a very unique face, it's lovely, I wouldn't get it done. Have either of you thought, "You know what I want to get some surgeries myself?" That's a really nice answer to hear, doesn't seem very common around here. Why do you think you feel differently to everyone else? - Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. Thank you. In Seoul, 60% of people in their 20s have had a surgical procedure. There's a picture of plastic surgery of someone having their chin done even on the tube. There's definitely a particular look going on here, big eyes, small nose and a narrow jaw. I'm meeting Myung, who's booked in for eyelid surgery in couple of days time. She's going to let me to follow her through her procedure. What made you decide to have the surgery? For me it is strange just because if you weren't getting a job or struggling in the job market, we'd probably try a lot of different avenues rather than think, "Alright, I need to change my face." I feel like before, plastic surgery used to be out of the norm kind of thing to do whereas now it seems like everyone's doing it. Why do you think that is? So this is your first big operation then? How do you feel about it? I think you are gorgeous, honestly you're so pretty. So for me, it's shocking that you want to have it done. Aww, thank you. I want a nose like yours. We'll switch, right? - Bye. - Thank you. I've been thinking about having my nose done for years, but it's never felt like quite the right time. Hello. Now I'm going to have a consultation with Dr Oh, one of the most famous surgeons in Seoul. On his website, he claims to be the god of facial surgery. Obviously I was excited outside, but I'm getting a bit... Um, I'm sort of tensing a bit now 'cause I know that I'm an easy sell, so I'm worried he's going to be really persuasive and I'm like, "You make great points," "I will look better. Let's do this." Can you imagine? "Sam, I've just put a non-refundable deposit down, "I'll be back in about eight months, "the baby will be born here, "plus side, it will have a dual passport, "how do we feel about that?" - Oh, hello. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm fine. - Excellent. - I'm Dr Oh. Excellent. I'm Annie. Just wondering what you would recommend for me? Ah, for you. Yeah, I know obviously... I know it's a big ask. What you would do? When the facial proportions are very good... Mm. ...for instance you have a very lovely facial proportion. Thanks. Even though you have scars, your proportions are very good. Good proportion. You don't really need plastic surgery, Oh, good. I'm out. - Mm. - Save me some money. I've had some work done recently in the UK. Oh, recently? Yeah, um, not too recently probably last September, I had my nose sort of narrowed at the top 'cause had webbing where the scars sort of pulled just to release the tissue. So you released the scars. Yes, to release the scar tissue, yeah. And I've started having laser work over there. Mm-hmm. But I'm looking at possibly getting something done with the tip of my nose but I wasn't sure what. Ahh, yes. Do you mind if I touch? Go for it, I've got a lot of make up on so you'll get it on your hand. OK. The difficult thing about scars, how do you say... The shortage of soft tissue is the problem. I mainly do cosmetic surgery. I try to make it more beautiful. Yeah. But in scar contracture or burn scars, it's more about the functional part. And to achieve the aesthetic part, it is very, very hard. Your nose tip, although there's a little room on the tip side, there's no room on the nostril side. The nostril, that rim, this part has to come down with it, with the whole nose. So, if there's not enough tissue here, - it's very hard to... - ..to pull it down. So would you not do a skin graft, would you not have... No, you don't like it? - No, I would not do that. - You wouldn't do that? If you gain something here, you lose something here. You're right. For instance there's a lot of depressions there those can be released a little bit more. What do you mean? There is depressed, because there is shortage of skin. It's wrinkled like this. There's no skin. Right, got you. So, if we release it and because there's no skin here, we're going to put something in here to replace the skin. Got you. So you will take skin from say here. Is there anything else you think I can get done? I do know that it's... Well, there's a lot to go for but... Not really? The skin is very tight there. There's not enough excess of skin to stretch. - Yeah. - OK. You have a good stay here. Thank you. It's funny because I think that I was a bit shocked that, I think maybe I wanted him to maybe do like, "You should do this, you should do that." I thought he was going to say, "Do a 100 different things." So I think in a way there's a tiny bit that I was a little bit disappointed because he said about the scar tissue that there is not a lot he could do, which is fair, you know, I think obviously really if I actually gave it a proper thought, that's an obvious thing. Now I know I have another consult so I'm going to wait so I haven't closed the book, but it kinda has taken the edge off and drawn a line under it a little bit. I don't want, "Yeah, here's a wand." "We can make everything special. You're gonna feel amazing." But in the back of my mind, I did think he would say, "Hey, try this." I've been a bit shocked by Koreans' obsession with this idea of physical perfection. How are you? I wonder what it would have been like to grow up here with a face like mine. I'm meeting a woman called Song to find out. What actually happened? How did you get your scars? Same. Yeah. Four weeks old. What would you say it was like growing up in Korea with burns? Since I've been in Korea, I've really noticed that image is important, how you look, what you do for a job, how successful you are. Did you feel that you had a lot of social pressure to fit in? Um, I... Give me a second. Oh, shit. I'm thinking more of you, 'cause I just think really, it's luck, do you know what I mean? Where you live, where you grow up. Growing up, whilst I was aware I was different, it wasn't a huge negative huge it was just, I was different. It wasn't until, and I got upset as well because you said you had trouble getting work because of your CV and the pictures. That my real trouble started when I was probably around 16 and all my friends were getting jobs in local shops, in the clothes shops and I couldn't really get a job. I'd go in and hand...'cause I went in and hand my CV in, no one would really want to give me a job. But beauty actually never came into it for me, if I'm brutally honest. And I always felt my mum always told me I was beautiful when I was a baby and growing up so I kinda just thought I was, in a way. Obviously I'm not, like, you know, Compared to the standards of other people, but feel lucky, that I grew up in an environment where I didn't think it was necessarily of more importance than your character. If I'm honest, I would have said probably the look a little bit more. I don't think I could be comfortable changing too far off of how I already look. I think I'd ever be comfortable looking at myself in the mirror thinking, Jesus christ, that is a very different face, but I would like my nose to be, because to be honest with you, it's embarrassing, I don't want to, you know, I want to have my nose a bit lower, I want to wear sunglasses. I think my nose looks weird with sunglasses. So yeah, that's for a look. I would like my nose to look nicer. I feel like the question is more what would I have if I couldn't have one or the other, would I go for a functional face? Obviously I'd probably go for function but no, I do want to look better. I would like to look better. It's the day of Myung's operation. She's having eyelid surgery at BK hospital, one of the biggest plastic surgery clinics in the beauty belt of Seoul. This place has 16 floors with three of them used purely for operating theatres. An incredible 10,000 patients come here every year. Myung is having a consultation with Medical Director, Dr Kim. He'll be performing her operation. This is a good example to make the eyes open bigger. Before surgery she has left eye weakness of eyelid opening muscle. So I serve... sell surgery to make eyes open bigger than left eye. So after surgery, she is more symmetrical. - That looks really good... - She has both eyes... ...and you can see how one is quite weak. Sometimes the plastic surgery procedure can make people more beautiful and prettier, but actually our purpose is to make people more, look friendly and they can have a good impression. Many Koreans and or Asian Chinese people have small eye opening and they have angry appearance even though they are not angry, everybody think that they are angry. After she opens the eyes bigger, she can have little more friendly, brighter appearance. Has this lady just had her eyes done or has she had anything else done? She has had eyelid surgery and nose surgery. - Her nose. - Yeah. If I am an employer, I will not choose the person who doesn't look friendly because when we hire people, they should look prettier and nicer and friendly to the customers. Do people say I want to look more friendly, more approachable? Many patients come to hospital to request surgery to change themselves to make them less scary and not angry. Right, OK. It's time for Myung's operation. I am definitely going to ask to keep this, unless blood splatters and then they can have it. Dr Kim has agreed to let me come and watch. I feel like I need to explain, I am not going to be helping at all. I'll be standing right at the back. I'm just about to go into surgery for the first time and whatever I said downstairs about it not bothering me is a lie. I'm not looking forward to this. This is local anaesthetic and after the injection of local anaesthetics, we wait for five or seven minutes. Did you always want to be a doctor? Yeah, I think this is the best job in the world. What do you enjoy the job? I think that this system is a pleasant job to make people beautiful and this surgical procedure can change the life of the patients. It looks so sore. The stitches are so small, it's almost like an art. Here it seems like your face is everything and I've heard that they take this to extremes. So today, I get to meet a face-reader so I can learn a little bit more about the ancient art of face reading. It's got a big impact on their society, on how they go for jobs, on how the direction of their life is, so I get to meet this guy, which he looks great, so yeah, I am excited. If it's good news, I'll take it. If it is bad news, he is a fraud. We'll just do that. We'll go with that. This guy, he works with some of the top companies, he works with Samsung, helps them pick who they're going to employ. Which is huge isn't it, all just because of their face. No, it's interesting, I wonder what he's going to say to me. I have good proportions remember so he better not try and rejig too much. If he recommends that I should have my nose done after what Dr Oh says, I might have to... No, I'm sorry that's off the table now, I'm not doing it. I don't, I'll have a think, it depends on what he says I'll get if I get my nose done. "Do your nose and you'll be swimming in riches and happiness" "for the rest of your life." It is a hard thing to turn down. Hi. This way? Should I take my shoes off? Is there anything you can read from my face? Mm-mm. I am, that's so true. Yeah, that's was so nice. So far, so good. Wow, yeah, that's so, yeah. Well, yeah, that's true. When I was a baby, I was in a caravan fire and then I was adopted out into a new family so you nailed it. Is there anything else you can tell me about my future? So you would advise me getting my nose done? Damn it. I'm back again. I thought I'd drawn a line under it. What are you doing to me? OK. I'll think, but if I do get my nose done, I would have... I can't just get my nose done like a regular face. I'd have it done and then there'd be more scars over my nose. And as you said a second ago, the scars impact your career. So, what would you recommend? This has given me a good insight to why the boom has even happened because obviously it's picked up huge amounts, the amount of plastic surgery people are having done, if people are being told directly by face readers that it's going to change their life for the better, why wouldn't they get it done? So yeah, I mean, I guess it's down to the individual and you just hope that they've got it in them to go, you know what, is it good for me, is it the right thing for me to do? The truth about plastic surgery here is that perfectly normal looking people are having really extreme surgery all in the pursuit of some strange idea of perfection. Back at BK hospital, I'm meeting Viv, who's about to have her whole face reshaped. Tell me about the jaw. OK, the jaw, I want to look like more slimmer because now I have a jaw that's quite, the shape is quite square. So after the jaw reduction surgery, I will look like more slimmer. - To slim your face? - To make it more sharp, yeah. Sharp? I want to get more prettier. - Oh, more prettier? - Of course. - You're gorgeous already! - No. So tell me about the fat graph, what's happening there. Fat graft. They're going to take my fat and they are going to inject it in my face So where are they going to take the fat from? You're tiny! Maybe they'll take some fat from my tummy or on my thighs. So thighs or tummy and then they are going to put it in your cheeks, to give you more fuller cheek bones? Yeah and the forehead. Put a little bit in the forehead, why the forehead? To make it more fuller because I think it's now very like... - Flat? - Yeah, flat. Oh, OK. I would never have thought that, but fair enough. Did you have a look in mind before? No, I don't have. You didn't have a look in mind. You came to see the consultant and then he sort of said, "You know, I think this would work for you?" Yes. So you weren't upset at all that he said, "Right, I want you to improve three big things in your face." No. You weren't at all, you were happy - that he said about this... - Yeah, I'm happy yeah. That's quite specific look, quite sort of almost doll-like, quite sweet look. Is that something that's popular with your friends? Most of my friends they have V shape look, which I don't have. Good. How you feeling about it? I'm feeling nervous of course but I'm ready for it, yeah. We are ready to start consultation. - Please follow me. - Sure. Come, let's go. She's, um, she's so pretty. The fact that the consultant told her to do those three big things, again it is nice she's come and he's given her advice but they're really big operations. She don't need it. Don't get me wrong, my doctors have even said these are options but fucking look at my face, I can get a load of crap on this sorted out. But her, I'm like... They are creating a slightly weird little army look. No one's looking like themselves, they are looking like they got that look. Of course you can do it, but in the end, does it need to be done? No, I don't think it does. That makes you think now, who is driving it? She didn't really have an idea. She's like, "Yeah, I just wanted to look prettier." It's a bit sad really, innit. I will draw a line for your surgery. The fat graph. Some depressions. I need on the temple. That will make your face look younger. You have some protruded bone, let me show you the x-ray. This is OK but here, too much protrusion, we cut this bone out. OK. Let's prepare your surgery. Can I come in? The surgery involves changing your entire facial bone structure and making the face much smaller. Right now being in here. It seems so excessive. Viv will literally have a whole new face by the end of this. I'm out. That was super intense. It's difficult to know what to say to that. Because I was having a chat with ole Viv and on a setae then I'm seeing her face being pulled from her jawbone. It's ridiculous. I've got a strong constitution in that area but, I was just like shitbags. Do you feel quite conflicted? I do feel conflicted, you know, seeing all of it and you just think as well like, you understand when people have big surgeries for big reason but, do you know what I mean, in the name of beauty and she is a gorgeous girl anyway. I don't know, I keep going back and forth because let's see, I haven't have my consult with Dr Kim yet. Do you know what I mean? He might say, "Annie do this, this and this." And there's like me, "Yeah, yeah, I'll be back in three months." Um... I don't know. It's just after that, you just... Do you know what I mean? You just want to hope that you can doll yourself up with some lipstick and a nice smile, don't you? Not all the doctors here are like Dr Kim. Sometimes surgery can go horribly wrong. I've come to meet lawyer, Shin Hyun Ho who specialises in plastic surgery-related lawsuits. Hello. He currently has 300 cases on his books. So are medical malpractices on the increase? How do you think the botch surgeries happen? And what would you say is the... What was the worst case you've seen? That's terrible. And how long has she been in a coma for? I can't believe that. That's horrible. You'd kind of think though she was a scholar, maybe she wanted to look into more who was doing the surgeries. It makes you think that... I don't know, I guess it can happen to anyone. Oh, my god, that's so bad. So do you worry then that cases are going to get worse so there's going to be more of these types of incidences if things aren't brought under control? So many young people are going under the knife. Do you think they are aware of the consequences? Thank you. Thank you. See you again. Meeting the lawyer has given me a lot to think about. Dr Kim is a certified surgeon and works at a government backed clinic. - Hello. - Hello. Hi. I've come to meet him to see what surgery he'd recommend for my nose. I made some computerised simulations for your nose. Yeah. Right now you have very shortened nose with this simulation surgery, we make some correction. We can see after surgery, your nose is coming down. Yeah. For the patient who doesn't have any scar contracture on the skin, it can release much more. Of course. But for your case, I'm afraid your skin has some contracture so I'm showing you a simulation surgery which can make only some degree of improvement. So this is without the graft, this is just with the cartilage. Do you know what, that's what would be the ideal because I don't really wanna have another skin graft. What would you recommend? Frankly speaking, if you want a little more perfect result, you still need skin graft. Right. Even though you need skin graft, I wanna recommend you to do structure changes first and if you really need it after structure change, you can try skin graft later. OK. So you think I can do one and then come back and do it. Not come back but its best actually to have a break? - Yeah. - Oh, OK. Do you know what, I can get on board with that. I can recommend another very simple one. This kind of scar should be released with skin graft. For example, your left finger, this joint should flex. - I know, it doesn't bend. - Should flex. You cannot flex that. That would be ideal, wouldn't it? - You cannot flex the joint. - No, I can't. The first one should flex like this. What, you think I can bend my finger? Yeah. Yes, that would be so good. I thought this finger would be long gone. My hands get really sore but I don't say anything because there's no point talking. My Sam always takes the piss, he says my hands look like a flipper. This surgery is not to make a cosmetic improvement, this is to make the functional improvement to make your fingers work properly. That would be so amazing. - I would love that. - Yeah. - I think I'm gonna cry. - I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed. Sorry. I'm so sorry. But yeah, that would be so nice, 'cause my hands literally are like, can't really... I think it's just annoying and they ache a lot and so I didn't think... I'm crying 'cause I didn't think that I could do anything about it. Oh, my god. If you're 30 and your hands hurt now, I think, well you know, what about when I'm 50 or 60? Do you know what I mean, you don't want... Yeah, I just think I worry that in the future my hands will, are gonna fail me, 'cause even if I write for like 10, 15 minutes. I'm like, "Oh, god That's got to go." So yeah. I want to make your big improvement of your function of the fingers. Yeah. That's so nice. That's much more meaningful surgery. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Thank you, bye-bye. Thank you. I didn't expect at all that he'd say anything about my hands which, you know what, was quite interesting because it made me realise what actually is important to me and speaking to him today, I got the feeling that not only that he can he help me functionally which was a huge shock. I didn't think it was on the table for me. If I can't use my hands, I can't work, you know. That's not something anyone wants to be thinking about at 30 and they ache a lot, you know. Day to day, they pretty much ache. So, yeah, sorry, I keep going on about my hands but I'm just... ...so happy about it. I made a joke to Sam, I said, "Sam, what you gonna do if I come home" "with like five different operations that I want?" And that's basically what's happened. This has gone horribly wrong, hasn't it? I thought I'd find some inner peace, instead I'm like, "You know what, I'll take it, the lot." "Thank you very much." I'm going to Call Myung-what? Choi now and have a little catch up with her and see, um... Yeah, how's she's looking. - Hi. - Hi. So how you feeling after your surgery? It looks brilliant. Ahh, that's good. That's ideal, that's lovely. OK, how about the love life? That's why you are not working, because you are focusing on your love life. Get back to the work. Success then. It's a successful operation. Its ideal. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. I think I've near enough made my decision about surgery. I think I am going to do it next year, there's next year at some point but my head's just not in the game right now. Look at me, I'm folding clothes, I'm thinking about him and can I breast feed, can I actually... Will I sleep, will I be a nice person still, will I hate everyone because I am tired? So cute, look at it. Actually, if I am honest, It makes me feel, I feel a little bit guilty thinking about wanting to have things done when I'm having a child. I should be not caring about that and all that mother earth and all of, you know... Focusing just on the baby, whereas there's still a part of me, that's like, "No, let's sort that nose out, sunshine." What it comes down to really, is what are you going to regret less. It sounds a bit morbid to say it like that but I think most decisions have to come to that. Because you are never going to be 100% on either decision ever and especially with a decision like this, because it is so grey, it's not black and white at all. I think I will regret less if I went for it, in light of history and how I've lived my life, I think, I'll probably have to do it, I know. Man. Pray. Pray, go for it. So... I'll have to go for it, won't I? Captioned by Ai-Media ai-media. Tv
