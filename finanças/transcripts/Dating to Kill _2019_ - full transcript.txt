Help! Help! Alright. How are you? Good. I'm so sorry, I'm so... I'm gonna be right back dear, okay? So you're sorry? Nancy, Nancy. What did the, look at this! It looks like a squirrel's nest! I can see that, did you remember to condition before the blowout? I kinda maybe forgot that part. Okay, can you fix it? Absolutely. Nancy why don't you go take care of my client, please? Thank you. I am so sorry Ms. Thompson. This will just take me about 15 minutes. And of course your cut, the color, and the blowout is on me today, okay? Well, it better be. Yeah, absolutely. I'm just gonna grab my product, okay? If you weren't my best friend I would... I'm so sorry. Melanie, could you hold my next appointment? I need to take care of something. Thank you. Oh, this is a really good one. You're gonna love that, yes. Aren't you gonna say hi? - No. - No? Why? Because I know what you want and I cannot do it. I just want a quick haircut. That is not what you really want. So what do I really want? You wanna go to lunch. Can't you see how crazy busy I am? I can but we don't have to go far. I'm supposed to go fix something. They are gonna see, they're gonna know we're here. I'm supposed to be getting lunch. No, no, no, there are more important things than lunch. - Get over here, now it's my turn. - Okay. Tessa! You home? In the kitchen mom! Hey sweetheart! How was your day? - Calculus test. - Crushed it! - That's my girl. - Yeah. And Will asked me to Fall Formal. Aww. Well, it's not like we didn't see that coming. Well, one should never count chickens before they hatch. You guys have been dating since freshmen year. I think those chickens have hatched sweetheart. For now but what about next year? Just enjoy every second of this time. And you only get these moments once in life. Thanks mom. You should do the same. You know, this time next year, I'm gonna be at some far off college unless you pull the trigger and move in with Christian, it's just gonna be you alone in this house. Oh, you had to go there, didn't you? Your little girl all grown up thousands of miles away. I'll get a cat. - Hmm, no! - I'll get lots of cats. Alright, go get ready. I told Nancy and Will we'd meet 'em for dinner. Ah, okay. It was like she'd been electrocuted. It was poofy and only slightly poofy. Oh no. It looks like a bomb went off on her head. Well that's what you get hiring your best friend to work for you. Aww, I wouldn't have it any other way. Oh please, I'm just glad working at the salon actually pays. Interning at this law firm for nothing is literally gonna kill me. You're almost done with law school, right? Oh, if two years is almost done, then yes. Let's change the subject to something less painful. Let's talk about Tessa and Will's college plans. Anything but that. Oh tell auntie Nancy about your scholarship, Will! Mom, you brag about him like he's your own son. That's because I'm proud of him. It's nothing, really. A full scholarship to VIT is not nothing. No way! How did you pull that off? Because he's brilliant? And Tessa is on the wait list temporarily with no doubt that she's gonna get it. Aww, honey that's amazing. So you have nothing to worry about. You're gonna be at the same school. Yeah, all the stressing about a long distance relationship for nothing. Hopefully! Okay, well I think that this deserves a toast. Yes, to Tessa and Will and VIT. Oh, and to your extremely successful salon. To your paying job auntie Nancy. Thank you. And to my mom who's the best parent a kid could ask for. I know you sacrificed a lot to give me everything that I need. I love you. I love you. And cheers! Cheers! I can put in some more curls when I pin up your updo. I'm sorry, hold on one second. Hey Tessa. Oh sure, yeah hold on. Honey it's Tessa. She seems upset, she's been trying to reach you. One second. Hi Tessa! What's up? Mom, can you come outside? Wait, you're here? Yeah. Well, Tessa can you please just come inside 'cause I'm finishing up a client. - Mom, please. - Alright, okay. Alright, hold on. - I got it. - Okay, great. I'll be right back, okay? Thank you. I'll finish blow drying you, sweetie. Tessa! Tessa, what is wrong? You are scaring me. Mom... I got in. I got into Vanderton! I got into VIT! What? You got into VIT? Oh my Gosh, that is so amazing! Okay mom, mom, just chill, chill. No, this is not the time to chill. This is the time to freak out! But seriously, how am I gonna pay for this? You're gonna get scholarships and listen I'll sell the salon if I have to. There is no way we're letting money stop you from going to VIT. Mom! That's it, it's done, you're going, okay? I want you to call Will, invite him over for dinner tonight 'cause we're gonna celebrate. I am so proud of you. So proud of you. Alright, let's go tell Nancy. Okay. I'm so excited for you, come on. This movie is a little scary for me. I'm going to bed. - Goodnight Ms. Taylor. - Goodnight mom. Goodnight. Will, will you lock the door on your way out? And Tessa, don't forget - to turn off the lights. - Turn off the lights. Got it. Thank you. Alright, goodnight. Oh my God. It's just a movie. These things actually happen. Not with me around, they don't. You made me miss the end of the movie. Well you didn't seem to mind. Okay, we are not messing around on my mom's sofa. What about the floor? Your bedroom? Will Radford, no! No, come on. Let's go. Okay. Get my jacket. Don't leave, no. I got to. See you tomorrow. Okay. Oh my keys. Sweetheart? Is everything okay? Yeah, why? Did Will go home? Yeah, he left a while ago. I thought I heard something. Alright, goodnight. Goodnight. Oh my God! Will, Will! Somebody help me! Will! Oh my God! Mom! Tessa call 911! Mom! Will. Tessa go back in the house and call 911. Oh my God! Will! Help! Hey I, nevermind. Hi. So when can we see him? Tessa... I'm sorry, he's gone. Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean he's gone? It was a massive heart attack. We did everything we could. Why? No, no, no, oh my God! No, no, no, no! There was nothing wrg with him. I love him, I love him so much. No! Sweetheart? Oh, babe. Can I get you something to eat? Sweetheart, I know this is the most horrible thing you've ever been through. And it's horrible. But just know I'm here for you. I'll check on you in a bit. Leave a message for Jessica. Hey, it's me. Listen, I know that you and Tessa are having a rough time right now. But I just, I wanna let you know that I'm here for you guys. And it'd be great to hear from you soon. That's it, okay. Thanks, bye. Okay, you've got some nice growth here in the back I think we should just clean up the sides a little bit and then a little bit on the top. I'm sorry, can you just excuse me for a minute? I think you'll like that. Hey honey, you okay? Honestly, no. I'm not okay. I'll be right back. What's going on? Honey, is Tessa still not eating? She's not eating, she's not talking. You know what I want you to do? I think you should call Christian and ask for a referral for a therapist. I'm not gonna be able to get Tessa to go see a therapist. Okay, then why don't you go? Maybe it would help to talk to somebody. Well, I just don't understand why she can't talk to me. Okay, I understand but maybe just being around you reminds her of all the good times with Will. Well, maybe that's true but certainly I don't need Christian to find a therapist. Why are you avoiding him? I'm not avoiding him. I'm just focusing on my daughter. - Sorry. - It's fine. I get it, okay? I get it, okay, go. Go home, okay honey I'll take care of the clients today. - I can't stay home. - Go! Are you sure? - I live for this. - Okay. Okay goodbye, be safe. - Katherine. - Hey. How did she do today? - It went very well. - Really? Yeah, she can talk about it now which is a big step forward. Okay, that's really good to hear. I'm extremely happy with her progress. She's well on her way to accepting what happened. Good, is there anything I can do that I'm not doing? All you can do is be there for her and I can tell you have been. Okay, well thank you. Thank you for everything. She's coming out of this, don't you worry. Okay. Well, we'll see you same time next week. - Yeah definitely. - Okay. - You take care. - Thank you. - Hi mom. - Hi sweetheart. What you doing? Just chatting with some friends. Oh really? What friends? Just some people I met online. You know, Katherine said that it would be a good idea to talk to people who have been through the same things that I've been through. Yeah, that's good. I'm really glad for you. Thanks mom. You know you can talk to me too, if you want. I mean, I know you think maybe I wouldn't understand but your mom's been through some pretty tough times herself. Hmm, mom, I know. But I'm really fine. Okay, well, can I make you something to eat? Sure, sandwich would be great. Awesome, I will make you a sandwich. Mom! Okay, sorry, one sandwich, one sandwich coming right up. Hey! Are you busy? I did wanna let you know that Katherine has really helped so thank you for that. I am glad to hear it. So, is that the only reason you called? I'm sorry Christian but things are still really complicated. Tessa has to be my focus. She needs me right now. Alright, well I understand. But it is really good seeing you. Alright, I'm really glad to see you too Jess. Hmm, look, I'm glad that you called me back because there's something I wanted - to talk to you about. - I know but Christian, - I just said I can't. - It's not, it's not about us. Okay. It's about Will. What about Will? Look, we always run a toxicology report whenever someone as young as Will dies suddenly. Yeah and you said it came back negative. It did, so then I ordered an individual tissue test and that's when I found something. You found what? I found very small traces of a rare poison, Oleander. It doesn't show up in blood samples because it's eliminated from the body so quickly. It only resides in certain tissues. Well, why didn't someone see this before? These tests take time, Jess. And besides, Oleander, it mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. It induces cardiac arrest, it's hard to detect. Are you telling me that someone poisoned Will? I'm telling you that it is highly unlikely that he ingested it accidentally. But who, who? I don't know, I don't know Jess. I just, I had to tell you because I alerted. So there's gonna be an investigation? And they wanna talk to everyone involved. And they're gonna drag Tessa right back through the hell that she's just recovering from. Most likely. Alright, okay. I'll talk to Tessa and I guess we'll just go from there. I'm sorry Jess, I know that this is the last thing you needed. Thanks. Tessa? Tessa, can I talk to you? Hey, it's Tessa, leave a message. Tessa, it's 2AM, where are you? I'm getting really worried. Call me. Tessa? Tessa. What are you doing out here? Nothing. I mean this obviously isn't nothing. Where have you been? Just out. Well, Tess! I need to talk to you for a second. Tessa, wait! I don't wanna talk and I don't feel good. I don't feel good either because I stayed up worried sick about my daughter 'til after 2AM! Now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? But I need to talk to you and you were out very late. Yeah, so what? I'm 18. Yes, you're 18, I don't know who you were out with and you used to tell me everything, so... - Things change. - Yes, sweetheart. You just went through a major life event. I don't wanna talk about that. It's fine. Let's talk about something, okay? Let's talk about anything. Let's just talk. Okay, fine. You bug me for weeks to hang out with my friends and then I hang out with my friends and you get pissed. So why don't you just make up your damn mind? - Tessa, Tessa! - What? Police don't think Will's death was an accident. Wait, what? They think that someone hurt Will. What are you talking about? They're launching a criminal investigation. Who would wanna hurt Will? I don't know sweetheart, I don't know. All I know is they wanna talk to the people who knew him. So have they talked to you? Are they going to talk to me? Yeah, they will in time. I just, I wanted to let you know. - Tessa. - I just wanna be alone. I don't know who she's hanging out with. Frankly I'm worrying. Do you think it's another boy? I don't know. Okay, well you still have her on your family cell phone plan, right? Yeah. Well? I'm not gonna invade her privacy like that. Jessica honey, you just said that you were worried. If something happened to her, you would literally never forgive yourself. - I know. - Exactly. So give me the phone. No, I can't. I would feel terrible. Which is why you have me to do your dirty work. Phone please, thank you. You are a sneaky woman. I know, right? It's also why you love me and I'm your best friend in the world. - I know. - Remember that. Okay. Okay, I found her. No, no, I got to talk to her. Okay, honey. That's just gonna make things worse. But thank you, I know you're just trying to help. I know. Thanks for making dinner mom. The chicken is really good. Well it should be, six hours in the Crock-Pot. Do you have plans later tonight? Yeah. And who is he? What are you talking about? I don't wanna pry into your life anymore. I mean, I want you to share things with me but if you're not there, I get it. But there's only one thing that makes a woman smile like that and it's not chicken. Well, it is really good chicken. It's not that good. Okay. Yes, I'm seeing someone. No, it's not serious but yes, it might be someday. And no, you cannot meet him yet. Cool. I mean, as long as he treats you right and you're happy. Don't forget I have to go back to the salon. So I won't be home 'til later. Okay. Yes, someone's broken into my salon. Yes, yes, hurry. I know it may be difficult but did you notice if anything was stolen? No, nothing. There was even cash in the register. He didn't take anything. Do you have any idea who would do this to you? No. Mom? - Yeah. - What's going on? Someone broke into the salon. Oh my God, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh my God. Tessa. Tessa? Where are you Tessa? Where are you? There you are. - Who is he? - Who? The guy you're seeing, who is he? It's Nancy, she saw you at a restaurant with a man. With a much older man, Tessa. Obviously, this is why you're not telling me anything. You're seeing someone twice your age. Age is just a number. No it's not, Tessa. You're 18 years old. This is only gonna end with you getting hurt. You don't know that. All I ask is that you just meet him for dinner. Please mom? Then I'll do whatever you want. What is his name? Tessa? Tessa! Tess! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! His name is Eric and he wants to meet you. So what we do is help US industries connect with skilled labor overseas in order to manufacture the products more efficiently. He has offices in Singapore, Shanghai, Bangkok, he's been all over the world. But this is home. I much prefer a small community over big cities. Well that's so nice. It sounds like you have a wonderful life. I do, I'm lucky. Tessa tells me you're an entrepreneur as well. You have your own salon. That must be fulfilling. Yes, it is. And go ahead and order whatever you want, Ms. Taylor. Dinner is on me. Call me Jessica. We're the same age after all. I'm gonna go to the restroom. Order me the Chinese chicken salad, dressing on the side. You got it sweetheart. I know you think I'm too old for your daughter. But Tessa is not just any 18-year old. She's a lot more mature than her age suggests. I mean, I've never met someone so interesting and smart. You don't have to tell me how great Tessa is. See, Tessa is not the problem Eric. The problem is you. I mean, why don't you tell me what a 38-year old man sees in an 18-year old girl. And you can cut the crap about oh, she's so mature and intelligent. You know what, don't actually answer that question, okay? I think I know what you find so attractive about her. The point is, what I'm trying to communicate is that I care about Tessa. And she's had a very difficult year. And I think I've been helpful in getting her past the hard times. And what would you know about the hard times that we've been through? I lost my sister last year, cancer. I'm sorry, I didn't know. When Tessa and I first started chatting online, I only wanted to help someone see past the worst moment of their life. To imagine a more hopeful future. I just wanted to help someone like others that helped me. You may not believe me and that's not important to me because I'm the one who has to look myself in the mirror every morning. Please know that I care about her very much. I didn't feel comfortable continuing to talk to her before I met you and asked for your permission to keep seeing her. But I understand your apprehension. And I will honor whatever decision you make. I am very sorry about your sister, Eric. And I thank you for being a good friend to Tessa but I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore, romantically or otherwise. Am I clear? Yes, of course. Good. I will let Tessa down gently and take the blame so as to not cause problems between you and your daughter. Well, I appreciate that. You seem like a good, decent guy and I'm sure someday you'll make someone very happy. Hopefully she'll be as wonderful as your daughter, only 10 years older. Thank you for agreeing to have dinner with me. Let's just get through this as if things went well. I agree. So, what did I miss? - Hey. - What did you do? What are you talking about? What did you tell Eric? He just broke up with me for no reason. What did he say? That things weren't working out. Listen, Tessa I know you're really upset but I always said that was never gonna last. I know you told him to do it. Is that what he told you? No, he didn't tell me anything, he just ended it. But I'm not gonna let you ruin my life. He has been the only thing that's made me happy since Will died. I understand but listen, babe, it wouldn't have worked with Eric. You're going to VIT in the fall. I mean, what would you have done? I'm not going to VIT. I didn't accept the offer. What are you even talking about? I don't care about VIT, I wanna be happy. All you care about is college and grades, you don't care about what makes me happy. Eric made me happy. I hear you, I hear how upset you are but you've got to know, this is all for the best. Oh God! Tess? Tessa! Hey, it's Tessa, leave a message. Tessa, hey it's mom, just please give me a call. Let me know you're okay. Alright, love you. One sec. - Hey. - Hi. What's wrong? Can I come in? Yeah, of course, come on. So I'm sorry to bother you. It's fine, Jess. Just tell me how long she's been gone. She left yesterday and she didn't come home last night. Okay, did you try to locate her on her cell? Yeah, she disabled her cell. And you think that she's with this guy? Eric Pritt? I don't know. I mean, he said he was gonna break up with her. He did break up with her. Okay, good, so she's probably just out blowing off some steam. But the police won't do anything for 48 hours. And I can't wait 48 hours, Christian. So please. Please. I mean, I guess I could use the hospital server to search his insurance records. I mean, if Eric Pritt has been to a doctor or a hospital in the area, at least his contact information would show up. It's just, it's really not ethical for me to do that. Christian, please. Please. Okay, fine. Okay, here we go. Eric Pritt, it looks like he was in the ER at Mercy last March. Lacerations to the torso, suspected knife wounds. Jess, who is this guy? I don't know but I'm gonna find out. Pull up his insurance information. Why? Just do it. Let's see, primary care physician, address, billing, here, looks like he's insured through his union public utilities. He said he was CEO of a corporation. Well that doesn't make any sense. What kind of a CEO works for a public utilities company? One who's lying. Thank you, okay, thank you for everything. Whoa, whoa, where are you going? I'm going to get my daughter. No, not alone you're not. Christian, you can't take this any further. You could already lose your license for the information you shared with me. Thank you for reminding me of that but Jess, something worse could happen to you. I'll be fine. Tessa! Tessa open up, I know you're in there babe. Tessa! Mom, what are you doing? Tessa, get in your car and go home. I'm 18, I can do whatever I want. Tessa, get in your car and go home now. Hello, Ms. Taylor. Stay away from her. I had every intention of doing that. You lied to me. No, I broke things off with Tessa just as I said Ms. Taylor. - Oh, don't call me that. - And I didn't say anything about you making me break up with her. Stay away from her! Your daughter called me last night. She said she had to get away from you. She said she never wanted to see you again and I convinced her not to do that. I know you lied about your job. Do you even have a sister with cancer? No, I lied about that too. If you come around Tessa again, I will have you arrested. On what charges? She can do what she wants. See whoever she chooses. She's a grown woman, Ms. Taylor. Believe me, I know. Stay away from her! Go home. Make things right with your daughter Ms. Taylor. You see, me and Tessa decided we're not breaking up. And I hope you will just let things be and not completely destroy your mother-daughter bond. If you try to keep her from seeing me again, I'll kill you. Do you understand? Bye, Ms. Taylor. Tessa. - Tessa, listen. - Mom, I really don't wanna talk to you right now. I know you don't but you've got to listen okay? He is violent, he grabbed me, - he threatened me. - Well, what do you expect? You broke into his house. I didn't break into his house, sweetheart. The door was open, I was looking for you. Rushing and screaming and yelling. I didn't know where you were last night, you didn't come home. I was worried about you. Okay, I don't wanna hear anything else about Eric. I love him, he loves me. We're not breaking up. Tessa. Tessa! Okay look, look at me. Does this hurt? No. It feels fine. Is that the face that you make when something's fine? Can you just give me some pain pills, please? You could've been seriously hurt. I know but I wasn't. You should go to the police. If I go to the police, Tessa is just gonna accuse me of trying to take revenge on Eric. He is dangerous, he threatened your life. I know but I can't make Tessa break up with him. I have to convince her that she wants to break up with him herself. And how do you do that? By letting her see how awful he is. Those stab wounds in the medical records. - Hmm mm? - Does it say how he got 'em? No, it was probably a street fight and that might make him seem cooler to Tess, if anything. People, they just don't become violent overnight. Well that's true. People usually have a long history of mental illness. So maybe we need to delve deeper into the medical records. Okay, contact information is one thing but I don't even have access to people's medical records unless they're my patients. Okay, but you could see who his primary care physician was. But that doesn't give us anything. Unless the court subpoenas his primary care physician for the medical records. How are you going to get a subpoena? I think I know. Without a trial, there is no reason for a judge to issue a subpoena. Okay, so what if I don't go to the police? What if I file a civil case? In civil litigation, it is the lawyer who issues the subpoenas. Yeah, and then I just need the evidence that Eric is not the great guy Tessa thinks he is. And I'm the lawyer why? I'll get on it, girl but I want you to do something for me first, okay? What? I want you to take this. Why do you have that? Just in case. Just in case of what? Just in case something like this happens. No, you know I hate guns. Honey, this guy's already threatened to kill you. I don't want a gun in the house with Tessa. I just want you to be able to protect yourself. Thank you, no. Okay, okay. Can you get me that subpoena? Okay, okay. Let's do it. Let's get to work. - Hello. - Hey, it's me. - Where are you? - I'm running. Jessica how quick can you meet me? Why, what's up? I think it's better if we talk in person. Christian, you're scaring me. Look, can you be at my place in a half hour? Okay, see you then. I'll see you there, bye. Okay, so thanks to you and Nancy, Eric's primary care physician was forced to turn over his medical history. Okay. He was in the psychiatric hospital for the last six years. God, why? The medical records don't give specific information but Jess it was a maximum security facility. So he did something criminal. He must have hurt someone. I'm afraid so. Do you think he could be the one responsible for killing Will? Maybe to hurt Tessa? To get to me? We don't know that, okay? But I think that we need to get you and Tessa some place safe. This guy is clearly crazy and possibly very dangerous. Okay, okay. What? I know you're mad at me but I really just need you to listen to me. I don't wanna listen to anything you have to say. Okay, okay, you don't have to listen. Just tell me where you are. I'm not home. - Are you with him? - Yes. Is he next to you? Yeah. Okay, don't alarm him, don't let him know you're talking to me, okay? But you got to get out of there. You got to just make up some excuse and get out of there. You're in danger. Okay, what's going on mom, you're scaring me. Tessa, your life is in danger. I need you to get out of there now, okay? Don't hang up but do it now. Go, go. Everything okay babe? Hmm, no, it's not. What's wrong? My friend, Emily, she's in the hospital. Who's Emily? You don't know her, I have to go. I'll take you. You don't even know her. I don't care, you're in no condition to drive. Eric, I'm fine. I love you, I'll call you when I get there. You promise? Yes, of course. Don't worry, I'll come by later. It's not like I can go home to my crazy mother. Okay babe. Call me when you get there. Let go. Why are you acting so weird? My friend is in the hospital, I have to go. Mom, what's going on? Just meet me at the police station, okay? And don't stop until you get there. I'll explain everything. Okay, I'll meet you there. Love you. She made it. She got out. Okay, it's gonna be okay. - Yeah. - Okay? I got to go to the police station. - Okay. - I got to go. Thank you, thank you. Hey. I don't understand. He seemed like such a nice person. Why is he doing this? I don't know. All I know is that this man was locked away in a maximum security psychiatric facility. He is dangerous, Tess. Well, what if I don't believe you? Have I ever lied to you? Have I? No, no, never. I mean... I just, I don't understand why he would do this to me. It's okay. No, I loved him. Come here. We are gonna get through this. We always do. No matter what. Right this way ladies. Alright, come on. Right this way ladies. Thank you. And you say this Eric Pritt assaulted you. Yes, he has a psychotic past and he's been seeing my daughter. Nothing illegal about a 38-year old dating an 18-year-old. Well, I don't care if it's legal or not. This man was locked away in a psychiatric ward for years. Well, you can press charges for the most recent assault. But I want him locked up again. I know he killed my daughter's boyfriend. And now my daughter is in danger so you need to do something. Did he ever try to hurt you? No. But he would have and he's already killed someone so what, are you just gonna sit around and wait for him to do it again? Okay, alright, let's just take a breath. I will look into the Will Radford investigation to see where they are at. I can also bring this Eric Pritt in for the assault charge but I'm afraid we won't be able to hold him for long. So what do we do in the meantime? You have a friend you can stay with just to be on the safe side? Yeah, Nancy. I suggest you go and stay with her until we can find him. You got this, okay, you got this. Do you really need this many books? I mean, ugh. Really? I mean really? Hello? Hello Nancy. We haven't met. I'm Tess' boyfriend. What, what are you doing in my house? I wanted to meet you. Tess has told me so much about you. My name is Eric. Don't worry Nancy, I'm not going to hurt you. Does... Does Tessa know that you're here? No, but she'll find out soon enough. Where you going? Nancy! No, get away from me, no, no! No, let me go, stop! - Let me go, stop! - Relax. Somebody, somebody help me! Stop, please! - Please, get off of me, stop! - Relax. Please, stop, stop, stop, stop! Hey, I finished packing. We got to hurry Tessa, he could be on his way. - Mom? - Yeah? You were right all along, I should've listened to you. I'm so sorry. Listen, it's okay. The important thing is we're together now and this is all almost over. But we got to go, it's not safe. Okay. Nancy never texted back. That's not like her. No, her class was out two hours ago, she'd definitely be home by now. Her car is here. Alright, let's go. Nancy? Are you here? Nancy! Tessa, Tessa! Tessa! - Mom! - Tessa! Oh no. Eric was here. We got to go sweetheart. Mom, what happened to Nancy? I'm sure Nancy is fine but sweetheart we have got to go now. Mom! What's wrong? Mom, is that a gun? - Yes it is. - What are you doing? Something I should've done when Nancy first offered. What happened? Eric took Nancy. I just need you to take care of Tessa. Yeah, of course but... Mom, I wanna be with you. I know sweetheart but you can't, okay? It's not safe. Jessica, where are you going? I'm going to make sure the detective does his job. What does that mean? Thank you, okay, thank you for everything. Jessica, be careful! Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm gonna need you to stay in the car. My friend is in there. And she could be dead because you didn't do your job when I first came to you. Stay behind me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Freeze, freeze! I said hold on right there! Hands up! Are you pointing a gun at me? Knock it out. Keep coming, keep it coming. Hands on top of your head. Down to your knees. Nice and slow, who are you and where is Eric? I don't know, I'm just his roommate. You're his roommate but don't know where he is, huh? No, okay? Then why were you running? 'Cause you're a cop. I didn't do anything, okay? I just hang out with him sometimes. God! Where are we going? Goodnight then. Well, I'm all done for the day here so we'll go to my house and you can wait there until we hear from your mom. Why hasn't she called? I don't know Tess. Look, everything's gonna be fine, okay? Come on. Okay, you have to tell me everything that happened when you were attacked in college. It was so long ago. And I only survived because the people nearby heard me scream. Help! Then they locked him up in a psych hospital. I just thought this was all part of my past. And in no point did you recognize Eric as the man who attacked you in college? No, back then I never even saw his face. I mean, the police used DNA under my fingernails to identify him. I only learned about his name. Jeremy Smithh. Yeah, at the trial, and even then I could not bear to look at him. And it was 20 years ago. I think I know why he's doing this. What do you mean? He was locked away in a psychiatric hospital for 19 years. Never had a chance to build a life for himself. Now that he's out, he's gonna try and take away everything I've built for the last 19 years. My daughter, the salon, now Nancy, my best friend. We're gonna find your friend. I promise. Yeah, but are you gonna find her alive? Leave a message for Dr. Christian. Christian, I've called you three times, where are you? Call me back. Tessa baby, where are you? Why did you have to go to the police? How do you have her phone? We were having so much fun and you had to rush off and call the police. What have you done with my daughter? I must confess you forced my hand. I hadn't planned on getting here so quickly but you proved to be pretty damn clever. Where's Tessa? What have you done with my daughter? Well, except for the part where you didn't recognize me at dinner, that was stupid on your end and pretty nerve wracking on mine. But I guess I have changed a lot. In the 18 damn years you had me locked away! Just leave Tessa out of this, okay? She had nothing to do with this, nothing. She's fine, stop whining! Listen, just don't hurt her. Don't hurt her, okay? I'll do anything, anything. - Anything? - Yes. Yes, anything Jeremy, anything. Tessa's here with me, we're hanging out. She's in perfect condition. Unless you decide to go back to the police and tell them we spoke. Then things could get very messy over here. No, no, no, I will not go to the police, no. Just tell me where you are. What's the fun in that? Please, please just tell me where you are. Like I said Jess, you've been very clever up to now. I'm sure you can figure it out. No, don't hang up. Don't hang up! Think Jessica, think. He took your daughter, took your best friend. Took your career. There's only one thing he hasn't taken. Mom, mom! - It's okay, it's okay. - Mom! Shh, it's okay, it's okay, I'm here. - Jessica, Jessica. - Not now. Jess he's behind you. So you did come alone. Let them go. It's me you wanna kill, it's not them. No, not really. What do you mean? You blame me for putting you in the hospital. You blame me for not having a life. That's why you're punishing me. Don't punish them, just let them go. I don't wanna kill you Jessica. That would be letting you off too easy. I wanted you to come here, not to kill you, but so that you can watch me kill your daughter and your boyfriend. I want you to live Jessica. But live as I do now, with nothing! No career, no family, no friends, and no lover. Okay, okay but you said if I didn't involve the police that you wouldn't hurt Tessa. I know. I know. But nothing has gone as planned with her. I was hoping that Tessa would've turned completely against you by now. But I guess the bond between mother and daughter is too hard to break. Stop that. Leave us alone or I will shoot you right now. No Jessica, really stop that. Don't make me Jeremy! You couldn't protect yourself then, you can't now. Don't move! Police! I'm up here! Up here, come up here! Alright, it's this way. Nancy, I am so sorry. Oh, honey, honey stop, it's fine. He roughed her up pretty bad. Left her by the highway for dead. But your friend is one tough cookie. Ugh, he didn't even hurt me. Thank you detective. I told you we would find her. I'm gonna let you ladies catch up. - Thanks for everything. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hi love. I need to go fix your hair. I know, right? I'm a hot mess. Alright babe, we're gonna let you get some rest, okay? - Alright. - Okay. - I love you girls. - I love you, bye, okay. Come on, this way. - Mom? - Yeah? What's wrong sweetheart? - I'm just, I'm so sorry. - I know. I know. - Again, let's go home, okay? - Yeah. Welcome home. This time you're in here for good. It's good to see you too Joe. How's the wife? I'm leaving now. I'm going to Vanderton but I'm taking you with me. I'm gonna make you proud Will Radford. You okay? Yeah, now I'm ready to go. Yeah but now I'm not sure I'm ready to let you go. Thanks for everything. Alright. Go makes us proud. And remember, no dating until you graduate. That's not a bad idea. Come here. I love you. I'm so, so proud of you. It's time for you to go start your new life. Time for you to start yours. Okay, go on. Okay, alright. Go. Get out of here. Bye babe! Bye mom! Let's go home. Okay.
