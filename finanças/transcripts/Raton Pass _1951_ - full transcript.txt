Whiskey and small talk It's that I can from you! You're forcing us to keep the earth that has only dust ... no one has the right do it for others! We offer you a reasonable rent ... and even our water barrier. If you were friendly like the others you may have had better things. Friendly? Take two make friends. Can we have water? If you want, you can have it. Whatever the truth about you ... also applies to landowners. This is not your type. It's my son's idea. And I say, take it or leave it! Define your passage. Sooner or later, every man you are making a mistake. Even a Halloween! Come here. Why did Mark do this? this choice? I still wonder Why did you choose Rathun? It's very simple. Why are you here. I? I have heard that the Chalons grow and grow ... and they fight with them. That sounded good to me. Do you have a better proposal? Many. And the first one is for you. I invite you to see our ranch. They imagined big area? Is it all yours? Up to this point you can see. That's great. I never imagined anyone could have either. Owning is one thing. To book, it is another.

And tell your Divine that only one person ... go to visit him on tomorrow's farm: I. Lupy! Joseph! Lupy! There is no soul in shed, the pen ... nowhere. Damn ungrateful. They shoved like rats. Mark did this. Nobody He was not with us. Maybe it's better. We're going to hire other people. workers. Foreigners Workers for us? At where? The people here hate Chalons, but they hate foreigners more. We will give them good wages. If we fail here, we will we left the area. Not May not be necessary go so far. I know a man. The ideal guy we need. Who? - Van Cleave. I came with him, with her. coach in the city. And he can to bring others. Where can I find it? Every sheriff can tell you. Incredible, is not it? In floor! Get up! Marc Talal eats powder. And there's much more you have to swallow. You are a great man Stand up! Stop this! All these years, I wanted to insulting a Halloween. Then your wife stole the ranch and you came to us with a beggar. All right, he fell to his knees. and I praise you! I said, on my knees! You always had a lot of help. in their fights. It's time to try your own medicine! You promised to hear it! It's all right. Arrives Not for him. I said enough! Leave that. I told my uncle that we are in love This will help us. Are you going to marry her, Chalon? I have to get rid of my ex-wife, Jim. If you want a good woman, I think this time you found it. Take the girl away, Jim. We came to find out what he wants here. Is good to have a reason and a good one. I have a good one, but I have to do it my way You play with your sadness ... and you wait we cry with you I'm not the greatest anymore landowner Chalon. None of those I was left behind. Nothing, understand? I finished I thought you wanted to come with me. I thought you wanted to to come with me. I want to close this passage. that I rented from you. Shut the mouth and keep it closed. I want to put 1,000 livestock this side of the lava. I have legitimate rights. The law is on our side. If there's a problem, we're together. What do you say, Pozner? It takes a lot of hate. to do this. I have more than that. And when the farm returns on my hands ... I will finance it irrigation work. You will have water. And what else do you need? And there will be enough for all of us. Wait a minute. It's all right. We will. You go close the passage. Come here. That was close. Very close. We will. From now on then we have to separate. Take some kids and go on the other side of the passage. Now? Is not it too hasty? Mrs Chalon should not fight for it. She is not a woman. who has been waiting for a long time. Kids, let's go. I have a lot to thank for you. Why did you lie like that? Why did you do that? About you and me ... It was not difficult for to convince Uncle Jim. You know, since I was so high ... I wanted you to. Me or him large property? Do you think that all women they are ambitious, are not they? You forgive me. You risked your reputation for me. You did it and you had no luck. What I've always wanted was to look at me. not up there. But down here. This is the only what we will do. I can do this. It was because of this You did not look at me. Why with this woman? you looked like a child with charcoal in hand. Because of that woman many men die, and maybe even a Halloween because of her. Jim Posner is not looking there is nobody to fool. Do you want to play a woman, is not it? good night All right, Sam. I'm with him. For me I go kill all. You do this for Elena. or are you a fool to believe in Chalon's promises? I have to believe him. It's nothing This is going to happen to us. And the battle will be with each other. we'll be after the smoke. And we can stay with the 1K thousand heads ... if it fails, we will accept. You know how to hit a man ... when it's already on the ropes. I learned from Chalon. On the other side of the passage, Van Cleave. Van Klee, are you sure? - Van Klee ... - speech! Come on, talk! Van Klee and many men. Yes! They came when we watched ... and without any warning. - Did something happen? Very. Van Cleave. Bring the cattle through the gate. - They took a lot on the pass. - There he is the Guardian. They killed him. Many left. I'll follow the tracks. Van Klee. A bunch of cowboys through the gorge. Some drive the animals. Go straight to Ganway Gorge. "Is Mark Chalon one of them?" - I did not see him. Come on! It's Jim Posner and his gang. Stop the fire! The law will take care of it. It's Van Klee circle you! Because? Not back? This is our opportunity. We can end forever. This will be the end. Sure, you want to finish? So he finished ... with his men. You did not tell us anything we will do. We fought with Van Klee and a band of armed men. Good evening, Miss Hall. Thank you Sheriff. Sheriff, you have to conceive Mark Chalon ... for stealing my cattle. To capture Mark Chalon? There was an error. Wrong or not, it was Mark Chalon. You have to play. Do you think that theft it's a joke Keep your mouth shut I'm too far ... to take orders from you. Is that true, sheriff? Mr Van Cleve is my supervisor. Chalon is not now the law here. We are. Mark and Jim Posner they stole a lot and they will not escape. You have to conceive it. I can not win Mark Halloween just because ... you want this. You should do it. You know what happens to the sheriffs ... who do not support landlords? And they still own land. Are you threatening me? No sheriff. Just remember ... their common sense. Chalon acts out law, sheriff. Land owners trust law, is under your protection. To capture Mark Chalon, I need facts ... witnesses. If this is not enough, What do you say about Poznhere? He was the boss of the gang. of Chalon. Poznhere is not a fool to risk his neck. Bring Chalon here, I'll bring Pozen when he comes back. And he will speak. I do not understand Mark. To participate in something. The affection is a serious crime ... he should know that. The penalty is hanging. He will come. To make sure that you do not will cause more problems. It's a bad night for You walk alone, Sheriff. My duty. "And why did you come here?" - I'm afraid, yes. I have to conquer you, Mark. Which category? Puppies that do not belong now for you. I would not do that, and you know this. Jim Posner will file that you did. He was there with you. Posner and me? He said that? No, but Van Cleve he saw you both. He will bring Poznner to the city. Come on, boys, come with me. Wait, Mark! Do not show up with me threatening my face! I pay you. You're not the owner anymore. of the city, Mark. And who is it? No one excludes the law. I'm not going alone. Next time, Mark. You did it! His kingdom came to an end. I'll let you know. The coat is bad. I do not see it that way. Why should we hurry? The Poznices. Have what Van Cleve, is in front of us. Get out, Pozner! Why do not you come? The light went on. So Mark stole them cattle, right? Do not deny it. I saw you. I saw you both. It was a bad deal. Did you make one according to the loser? But you may have a chance. You can be smarter and to make a better deal. I What you want? I want you to come along. in the city ... and send that mark Chalon was the leader of thieves ... then you will clean with everything. All I want is one a bow around his neck. No, they will hang you. is that you Do not trust them! Maybe this will make you to change your mind. No no i will what do you want! Now you're reasonable. Now you can understand. Maybe you understand what we are. You did Chalon. What happened here? Where's Jim? Jim was taken. Do not worry, Pozner will not stop. Let's meet the kids. Leave them personal You out of it. What do you mean, no? to move We'll be next. Who do you want Cheats, Cheats? It was what you wanted is not it? Burying in the same coffin? We will not knock. We will fight like should ... have fought against you for many years. Come on! Just leave. When we go to the city, they are the Van Cleve gang ... You should already have them have faced. and our only problem we'll be burying them. We're leaving the city. to become a battlefield? Not I'll convince the sheriff to leave. Posner. Careful here. Beware of things. He thinks I can take care of everything Not much, do not worry. Who's going to watch us? Not even a man like him can take care of himself. Pierre could help. Go to the city. Help to score as you can. I'll bring his father. In the city! Where's the prisoner? You, sheriff? I did not understand. They hit me ... and I warned Poses If Van Cleve does not hurry, he will Come with empty hands too. It seems that Van Cleve doing your job ... better than you. If he did not die ... no one can stop Mark Chalon now. It is? If he tries to save it Pozner, you have the right ... kill a man because tried to run away. Wait, Ann. Is not it an exaggeration? How far will it reach It depends on Mark. Okay, sheriff? Here's your witness, Sheriff. Speak, sir. I have to bring the woman. Are you here to remember? Mark Chalon is responsible for ... for stealing them cattle in the afternoon. It is not enough? Chalon has not yet been arrested. And you have to know that. He will come back. If it does, catch it. Do not need You, sheriff? Or do you want to deal with it? with that too? All right, men. Clean it and get the horses. It will probably come to Sheriff's Office ... and I want you to cover the road on both sides. Put it on a cross fire, along with them. A place there and another there. Go! Take your martyr and locked it. Stay in your office. You go I'll take care of the rest. Now there's a tough guy of Chalon that never was. I'll take Mark. I really do understand this job. - Leave it to me. "You're talking about murder." I'm talking about common sense. Let's not worry about Mark Shallow now, do not you understand? I'm not worried about him ... I'm worried about us! What does that mean? ranch for you? I'm surprised what did you do. Mark Mark died? He comes alone. No problem ... all is well. Mark, you finally made up your mind. I was hoping you'd come to deliver. Rathun's shrewd sheriff, licks Van Cleve's boots. Guardian of the law pretends to be the law. If we have a problem tonight, let's You have to review the orders. Where's Posner? Listen Mark, Posner You are my prisoner. It will cost you try to catch. And this will cost you. also if you do not set him free. The Posner gang they go crazy here. Better to let it go. first of all Lava, come here. Listen, Chalon, no. I did not want to say anything ... they forced me. I did not say you stole the cattle ... You have to get me out of here. Van Cleave forced me talk like this ... hit my husband You have to believe me. I know that. - Let's get out of here! - Are you serious? A Chalcon is in danger his neck to me? He opened the door. The Chalons gang is coming here. I stopped him, let's stop. and the same way. Stand out We define the sheriff's law. You hold ... I would like to comfort her. Widow, if I were in your place. All this years we were illegal Now is our time. Let's go out for them give them to understand. It does not benefit, Sam. What to do? Put him on his feet like him dog with a tail tail? Listen to all of you! Van Cleve wants a fight now. The crossfire did not is a good choice. Let's get the guy who we call men. We'll be a bunch of crazy people. if we do. We will meet and we will think about how to act. He is right. Go with Chalon, We're in it together. We have to act accordingly. in the scope of the law, is our only chance. Take Prentice as a shield, to get out of here. "They're taking parents." - Do not shot. Ended! What are the types of anger, I would not want to be in Prentice's position. You have to get him out of there. Maybe I can try. Idiot, if something happens to him ... I do not like to talk like this ... even if you are. Do you see this? This is Prentice's weapon. It will help you a lot. Where are you going? You will not like it. I do not like it now. Do you think it will I'm your supervisor. knowing what you are planning? You will keep me in your game ... and I'll hold you in mine. He will not have a toy. to kill him. And if I kill him, the banker Your account will also die ... That's what you're afraid of, is not it? Okay, I'll bring it back. - By arrangement. - Agreement on what? You'll pass me the ranch. and some animals. Think carefully. With your stillness. They do not kill quickly. like you and me. Jim!

He tried to catch it. from prison. Van Cleave stopped him. You do not know how badly I felt it, Mr. Chalon. You, Sheriff Ratun ... the city sheriff left kill a halloween? Van Klee is the supervisor from the farm. I just did what I did ... I supported the ranch. Mark and I are the ranch. Van Klee was with us all your gang and I was alone. You are no longer alone. You go follow Van Klee. Both of us? We will not have a chance against all of them. Call my people. He was here with Mark's body. Maybe they went to Pozner at home.

A woman must have the pride of her husband. Most have to he is proud of his children. A husband is not perfect. Was made. But a child is different. It was created as an image in mind.
