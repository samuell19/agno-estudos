The Red Army is retreating in panic. offering little resistance to victorious German troops. Please, call the grocery and order some strawberries with cream for me. - What? - I asked you to call and order some strawberries with cream. Didn't you understand me? What strawberries, Margot? I want some strawberries with cream. Here and now. Damn it! - 6 months. -What? I said that we had met six months ago. Are we going to celebrate this anniversary? -We can go out to some place. - I hate looking at the Germans. I have an impression that all the German armies invaded the Paris cafes. Do you think there is a single private of the first rank left in Germany? There surely is one left. -Where are you going? - I have to be off. Today is Sunday. And we are not through with the discussion of our jubilee... What would you suggest? I suggest we stay at home. We'll buy some wine. I’ll cook something delicious. -What products do you have? - Some oil. - Is that all? - No, I have some potatoes as well. I’ll cook some baked pudding. Again? Well, the last time was an occasional flop. Why are you staring at me? I can cook. I can cook. You'll eat everything, including my baked pudding. Today you’ll do everything I’ll ask you to do. - Today? - I can't wait for two days. After all, we could have met two days earlier. -Are you Mr. Gilbert? -Yes, I’m. This is for you from our quartermaster. Come in. Put it here. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Gilbert. - Do you know the news? -Yes, I’ve already guessed. So the cognac box has been delivered to you. My congratulations. You've won. The Russians are retreating in panic. Do you think we'll take Moscow by this Christmas? The Christmas is still six months away. Change your mood. There are only six months left. Yes, another six months... Yes, the Russian army is immense. But they won’t fight for their commissars and for their Jews. The population is said to greet our troops with vodka and flowers. - These statements are hardly true. -What? I said it was not true. Such things could seriously hamper our offensive. Can you tell me who needs our work now? We are still on the run Looking for something. Very soon all these chapels and pianists vanish on their own. There will be no one to listen to them in Moscow. I wish I were that optimistic. There is only one thing that is clear to me. For the Red Chapel this attack is a real blow. Yes, it is. Now what? People are people. Contact the police. Don't hesitate to report to me anything suspicious. I mean all outbreaks of violence and all suspicious types. -Well, report to me everything unusual. -All right. -What is all this fuss about? - They are moving. The building will host the Denitz fleet HQ. His headquarters? It is really interesting. it could lead to very interesting results. Well, the Germans have crossed the line. The Non-Offensive Pact is done with. I won't be ashamed to look into the eyes of the people back there. Come on! Do you think this war will end soon? - I don't know. - In about two weeks. - It might even take three weeks. -You seem to be bragging, man. I think the war will continue until this fall. Propaganda is one thing and the Wehrmacht military might is really not too small. Until this fall? Our troops will take Berlin in August. The most important thing is for the diplomats not to get into the picture. I understand all that, but what are we supposed to do? Us? We are free to do anything the wartime situation requires now. Calm down, man! -We won't derail the trains here. -And this is a mistake. - It is high time for all that now. - Right now... I want everyone to understand that. The age of coffee house intelligence is over. Eva mistake of ours will take us not to the courtroom. No Embassy will protect us. Our mistakes will take us to the hands of the Gestapo artisans. No one will help us. No one will even know about our deaths. Any mistake means death for all of us. - Take my words at their face value. - Come on! Don't frighten us! I’m not frightening you at all. I simply evaluate the situation. By the way, why aren't you in the shop? Damn it, what shop do you mean? You mightn't have heard that the war is on. -You... -You'll return to the shop floor now. And you'll show up in the office next time only when you are summoned here. Why so? You are just a shop assistant in the company and thus... you can not enter either this office or my apartment. I think I got it right. This is a vivid display of class inequality. Will you raise a toast for our victory? Yes, I will. Eric, did you listen to the report of the headquarters' new security officer keenly? -Yes, I even made a few notes. - That's good. Now you are to invert all the statements of this report in your actions. -What do you mean? - The security manual prohibits hiring local workers for the repairs in this building. Publish an announcement and take everyone. Did you say ''take''? I mean hire anyone. Find some old maps and stack one of the sections with them. - Take away the guards. -Yes, sir. That's all. This organization is called ''Todt''. Earlier they did the construction works only, and now they are responsible for supplying the troops with food and ammo. To put it in a nutshell, they are responsible for every aspect of rear supplies. -Are you listening to me? -Yes, I’m. Continue, please. You can hardly imagine what business prospects the Todt membership opens. Unrestricted entry to any county, tax breaks and access to some very hot data. What has happened to you? Tell me whether you think I’m guilty too. Guilty of what? I had to make them listen to us. To make whom? We've shouted right into their ears for last 6 months that... Hitler would start the war in summer. And they kept feeding us with that ''British provocations'' bullshit. Where is your professional intuition? We were told that this opinion came from the man at the top. We had to provide the Op Center with the data they couldn't ignore. We had to find arguments and work harder. And I got too relaxed during the last 6 months. Excuse me. I have to make a call. Hello, Jean. It is so good that you called. I’m almost ready. Please buy some bread on the way home. I forgot about it. What? Why? I have to leave the county on business. Will it be a long trip? I don't know. It might take a lot of time. Do you have to depart right now? - Yes, today. - OK, what time do you leave? What station? I’ll see you off. You won't have time. I depart by plane in half an hour. -Where are you going? - I don't have time to explain it to you. Jean, will you be able to write me a letter? I don't know. Excuse me. I must be off. Hello, Jean! Well, today you are a late bird. Well, this job takes a lot of time. -Are you a businessman too? -Yes, I’m. Only our dogs suffer. And the dogs too... Where did we stop? Oh, yes, this war with Russia... it is rumored to be very short. Guderian, Manngeim, Keitel, Kesselring... These names are the names of military geniuses. Napoleon had Murat, Daladieu, Elait and himself. The Russians had their own generals, but their chief general was General Bitter Frost. So do you mean that if they don't take Moscow before winter...? No, not that far. Napoleon failed the winter campaign because of his ego. When a man doesn't see some evident things, it speaks for itself. At least it means that he doesn't have the brains for understanding all that. - Do you mean ghosts? - No, I mean the heavenly revelations. Revelations, Mr. Gilbert Well, Mr. Dietrich, the heavens are not responsible for everything in our lives. Not for everything, but for a considerable part of them. As we live along, this area of responsibility keeps augmenting. I think you sound pessimistic. No, I would say I'm a tragical optimist. Hi there! Well, what's up? There are the HQ of the German navy right here in this city. Well, that's pretty convenient. Continue, please. I’m going to apply for some house painter job there... Now you are going to return back to the shop. - But you must listen to me! -What for? I know what you'd say. You are going to apply for some job there... find some heavily guarded room, and steal some top secret maps. -Am I right? -Well... Oh yes, before you depart, you'll place bombs everywhere. to blow the HQ to pieces. - Have I forgotten anything? - Now what? Nothing. If the Germans are going to repair this building... hiring total strangers, they either are imbeciles or not. - They are not idiots, Sergei. - So it must be a trap. You are right. So go back to the shop. Continue selling our overcoats. Well, see you later. You are lucky not to know our top brass. Especially the ones whose names start with ''von''. Here is an example. We received an order for the cloth for the Rommel army tropical uniforms. Before that we had purchased some cloth for our artillery. - Waiter! - Yes, sir. What's that? It is the caviar that you've ordered, sir. Good. And what was the amount I’ve ordered? 150 grams, sir. Gilbert, if this serving weights at least 100 grams, I’ll pay for our dinner. Don't tell me that you have no scales. - But... - Please, bring the scales... No, no, bring the scales here. -And what about that Rommel order? - The Rommel order? One of my aides made a mess of the production assignments and they produced tropical shorts for Rommel soldiers from this artillery crap. He must have disliked it very much. You are not right. At that moment he was so victorious that... he didn't care about the buying outfits of his soldiers. Still there were people who publicized this story. The Germans are fond of paying into other people's meals. Yes, your job is pretty difficult. Do you think I got this belly eating caviar? No, I have a nervous job. You shouldn't complain. While the war is on in Europe, it'll keep you busy. And I’m going to be ruined very soon. The overcoats do not sell this season. Although I think the German army needs both overcoats and inflatable rubber boats. What about that, Mr. Quartermaster? Now everything is in the SS hands. They check the backgrounds of all suppliers and the ones who suit their requirements, are invited to join the Todt organization. Mr. Gilbert, I’m a little man. Here comes our little boy. Look, it is 130 grams. Take away for the weight of the dish. We get 90 grams of caviar as a result. That's how they cheat upon German soldiers. Excuse me, sir. Sir, it seems to be a misunderstanding. We'll replace everything in a second. Mr. Gilbert, I’d like a roll back of three per cent. These three percent will ensure you a place in the ranks of the Todt suppliers. It is a deal. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Could you select me an overcoat that won't get visibly dirty fast? May I have something larger? Do you think it is larger? -Yes, it is. - Listen, I’ve come here to spend my money. Will you spend some of your precious time on me? - That's much better. -You are welcome. It looks great. isn’t it too wide for me? - It suits you perfectly. - Perfectly? This overcoat looks great. Simply great. Do I look like Clark Gable? A real Clark Gable. Well, the sleeves. Aren't the sleeves too short? Everything is fine, but the sleeves are too short. May I have a look at some other overcoat? How about that? Is it better? It must be ready in winter. It is going to be a success. Hi, Helen! - Helen! - Hi, Francois. Liz, hi! I’m so glad to see you again. -Are you alone? -Yes, I’m. And where is your capitalist friend? ls he busy counting his revenues from another war? How did you come to be a Marxist? As you know, I studied in the university, and the only thing I remember from the economics course is that capitalism is doomed. You've made a friend of the man from the dying class. Helen, don't listen to him. He's simply jealous. Your new boyfriend is a decent man. By the way, I want to make a business proposal to him. - Could you talk to him about that? - I can not. - He's left Paris. -When did he depart? - Is he going to be away for a long time? - It is none of your business. The session is over. Helen, will you talk to him when he comes back? - I don't know when he comes back. -When did he depart? - The day before yesterday. - What do you mean? I saw him yesterday. He was coming out of a hotel in the company of some German. You must have mistaken him for someone else. I’m not blind. You seem to have a nice place here. I can not afford it. I'm still in the army. - Thank you, Jeanne. You may leave. - Thanks. Well, let's drink for a new official trade partner of the Reich. - I’ll read it later. - OK. Well, this is your first order. These are patterns, sizes and other important data. But these are warm autumn overcoats. Yes, the warm ones. - Do you need two layers of cotton wool? - In Russia it starts snowing in November. Have you ever been to Russia? The only place I haven't visited is the Antarctic region. I skipped it because polar bears are hard to sell. Gilbert, read these papers attentively. If you have any questions, call me at home. Don't call me in the office. As to our deal... I’d prefer gold billions at the exchange price. - It is very reasonable. -Yes, it is. All currencies are not stable these days. Comissaire, I beg you to give it one more try. This isn't the most popular name in the district. Yes, I’ll stay on the line. Yes, yes. I’m writing all this down. Yes. Yes, thanks. Well, let's have a look. 450 overcoats for non-commissioned officers. And 170 overcoats for junior officers. Ranked up to an obersturmfuhrer. All the items require cotton wool lining. OK. A NCO usually heads a squad consisting of people. A sturmoffizer commands from 70 to 120 soldiers. All this adds up to 52 thousand people. It equals approximately... It equals three full-scale divisions. - Hello. Jean! Jean! Is that you? You've dialed the wrong number, lady. Jean! They've called the wrong number. So let's go on. These are blueprints. Rubber boots. - I’ll make necessary calculations at home. - Cloth... Emma is getting nervous. - I’ll finish the estimate tonight. -All right. And pass the results immediately to Kent. Not at once. Not at once! I’ll pass them over tomorrow. Gilie, dear, Gilbert has nothing to do with that. Helen, I had to do that. I don't have the right to be myself. I don't have the right to explain anything to you. Why are you silent? Why are you so silent? What should I talk about? Jean, I hated you so much yesterday. And today I really don't know. How could you do that? How could you do that? I’ve never asked you about anything. I’ve never made any requests. I accepted all the rules of your game. I stayed with you because I wanted to be with you so much. You can not treat me like that. Why have you done all that? Listen, I don't have anyone closer than you. I’ve done all that, because I feared for you. You can not be at my side. I can not explain anything else to you. I thought I would manage without you, but I can't I can not be without you and I can not be with you. I really don't know what to do. it is up to you to decide. -What's this? - The keys to my apartment. I hate myself so much. What for? Because I can not hate you. Waiter, can we have more champagne? Sir, would you like to honor us and raise a toast for brilliant victories of the German army over the Soviets? Don't you want to drink for the German army? - OK, Hans, let's go. - No, he'll drink for it. Drink! I order you to drink! Drink! Bastard! Gentlemen, he's a Communist! Where are you running, idiot? ls there any information from the Navy headquarters? Nothing. The trap didn't work. There are a few reports from the police. Only one is really interesting for us. There was a drunk fight in a restaurant. The participants were German officers and some drunkard. He managed to escape, but they alerted all the neighborhood. it helped to track him down. The officers knocked at his door, he never opened and... - The officers broke the door. - They broke the door. What followed it? When they got into the apartment, they found two more people over there. There also was some equipment there. -What equipment? - I don't know. Might they be our pianists? I don't think so. Although you should go there and check it. Find out what kind of equipment it is. Equipment, eh! Freeze, everyone! Halt! -Why are you standing still? Follow him! - Follow me! You two will stay here. Hurry up! Hurry up! You follow me! Can I see you papers? Take it down. Ask them to call the Todt organization to check his identity. -Who, did you come to see? - Charles. I came to see Charles Pignon. - Is he a friend of yours? -Yes, he is. - How old is he? - He's about 40. -What doe he look like? -What do you mean? What's the color of his hair and eyes? He's dark-haired. And I really don't remember the color of his eyes. What's up? The identity confirmed. He works for them. You should leave this place as soon as possible. His luck doesn't have anything to do with that. You must have set up the guards in the street. The guards... And still he was so fortunate. A good boy! Now he must look like this. If you had conducted the operation with Less fuss, he'd have taken us to his master. And in reality he went to the mattresses with a new set of documents or even... left the city altogether. Take a seat! Don't make too much fuss. The city is sleeping. Don't make any noise. How can you remain so quiet? Do something. Scream at me, after all. What can I tell you after that? it is your fault that we've lost our transmitter and that our radio operators are now being tried in the Gestapo prison. - I didn't want to... - I know what you wanted to do. You wanted to face someone in an honest battle. Do you understand that you've put all the network under fire? What should I do next? Should I commit suicide? If you've changed your mind about committing suicide, stop weaning. Go to the mattresses. Disappear. The only place for you now is our secret hideout. No contacts with any of us. That's all. But can I spend this night here? Should I sing a lullaby to you? And tomorrow morning all the patrols will be fresh and robust and your portrait will get into every policeman's hands... I’ll take my little one to the secret hideout.
