You're out of yourtiny mind Turn that damn music off You're an arsehole Vincent, don't push me too far All I ask is a bit of courtesy Show some respect, or else Clearly respect is Greek to you It won't go in yourthick skull Look at me M. Lefort? I didn't see you You look well What a lovely day Watch out, I'm starting up That bastard He's sick, plain sick Is it only to annoy me or does it amuse him? I'm coming Don't. Not yet Hell, it's good When's your husband back? He's up there, we're safe - It's me - I know. I heard you - Having a bath? - I felt sticky There's a funny smell in here Really? What kind of smell? That's odd, it's like sperm Ah, I know It's that new floor polish Just you and me, great isn't it? Yes, it's wonderful Look at this landscape You should see it from the air I often think of you up there Me too, I often think of you I try to imagine you. If you're bored? Me bored? Never. No, I'm always busy Good, I'd hate you to be bored My love Shit! It's not him It's not Vincent's writing You said he didn't suspect Yes, but now I'm scared I swear, he tried to kill me I think I'd better disappear. I won't phone you either What d'you mean "chicken"? I can't risk my life for a f... "Hail Mary, full of grace. Blessed art thou among women" Oh my God "Happy anniversary, my love. Meet me at the airfield "I've a surprise. Love you, Vincent" Darling, please forgive me - What d'you mean? - Let me explain Explain what? That I've become a workaholic? Blind to his wife's needs? Is that what you want to say? No need to, H?l?ne. I know It's I who should apologize. But I'm going to change You won't recognize me It's ourwedding anniversary. I'll take you up for a spin I'll show you something new Look, my love. Our house You've never seen this view Isn't it beautiful? To celebrate our anniversary, we'll loop the loop It's fun I've cut your seat-belt When we're upside down, out you go Not cross? I loved you so much Goodbye, my love Is Vincent Baraduc guilty or not guilty... ...of killing Mariano Escobar in a car crash? The jury finds him not guilty Is Vincent Baraduc guilty or not guilty... ...of killing H?l?ne Baraduc, his wife? The jury finds him not guilty Consequently, Vincent Baraduc, you're a free man No "buts". You're free, old chap. It's as simple as that Thanks for not wearing a bra When a woman's not wearing one, you can imagine her naked It's very arousing, believe me But when she's undressing, it's best if she wears one So she's not naked too soon It prolongs the pleasure. See? Just imagine the thrill... ...of slipping a bra strap over a bronzed shoulder... ...or solving the puzzle of a new fastener They make such gorgeous things nowadays in ladies' lingerie I've a confession to make I can't resist women who wear 'Jicky' perfume - Even if they're ugly? - That's what's incredible Women who wear 'Jicky' are never ugly When I met my wife, for example. One whiff, and I was in love You're married? It's awful. I'm here with you, yet I still love my wife But looking at you, I wish I were a widower Yes, life would be simpler if she were run over by a bus See the problem? Monsieur, yourwife has been run over by a bus 82 francs. Can I settle up? Marie? Hello, dear. Had a good day? Marie, for God's sake. This is serious No, it's not serious. I'm not in love Sorry, let me introduce you. Paul, my husband. Monsieur...? Monsieur Gora brought me home in his taxi - You can't do this - I can, because I am You're just doing it to hurt me Yes, just to hurt you. It's my turn Stop it Stop it, please Paul, imagine going into a tea-room lmagine seeing me with a stranger, fondling his fly and saying: "How divine, no underpants "And yet, it's so arousing taking off a man's pants" What would you do? Sit down at ourtable, smiling And order a cup of tea? Ah, I get it now. I hardly know that girl - I've not even fucked her - Pity. Lots of others, I bet Forgive me, Marie. I'm a full-time creep I only realize how much I need you when I'm with anotherwoman Forgive me I'm leaving. I'm sick of this Don't go. Don't spoil things I've forgiven you 100 times I'm tired. I've had enough Sorry we didn't finish Goodbye, Paul God, what a fool I am If you don't mind, I'll be off. You don't need me now Good riddance! About time too, Marie I can breathe again. Thanks That's right, you tell her. Women are bitches or nymphos Take yourwife, for example She hails my cab, she brings me here She doesn't ask my name, or offer me a drink And the end result? What a let-down Listen. Normally, I'm a quiet sort of bloke But right now, I'm pissed off, exceedingly pissed off So, do me a favour Go home to your monkey house and be nice to your family. OK? Sandrine? It's me There you are, silly So, had a good day? Bored all alone, aren't you? Fine. You sit and sulk. I'll make dinner And when I say "dinner" I mean dinner Dinner! Did you iron my shirts? Only joking, I know it's not your job Let's see what's on TV Never lift a finger, do you? Still, that's how I like you. Sweet and silent If I belch and fart, you don't complain Nor if I forget to put on my slippers I put my feet on the table, forget the shopping... ...stay in bed till noon... ...go to the Motor Show, smile at married women... ...and you never rant and rave, or make snide remarks You leave me in peace I do the same for you You're a great girl I dreamed of being single. No ties. Free to do as I like But she's been gone a month and I've no desire to do anything It's always like that But people get over lovers' tiffs Not this one. I can't forget her, I'm obsessed She's always on my mind She's more present than ever Some days I wish her dead You said it, not me - Sure it's here? - Yes - You do the talking - If you like - He may tell us to get lost - I doubt it Like the cut? - The cut? D'you like it? - Fine In court they call me Elegance That him? Yes It's fishy Really? Why's that? He has no line So? I don't trust him Paul, you're nice but spineless I hope you never find a four-leaf clover Hello. Any luck? My name's Fran?ois de Nemours. But people call me Elegance - I'm Paul, his nephew - Bully for you - Remember me? - Should I? Well, you might. But we're not here to test your memory We're here with a job offer - I'm retired - I know This is a job you can't refuse Killing this man's wife What do you think? Frankly, I think nothing Or rather, that you're crazy and I'm normal So, you loonies take a walk, while we normal folk fish - Without a line? - That's right, without a line Fish don't bug me, I don't bug them. Life's easierthat way Forgive me insisting but you're missing the point What we said was, it's a job you can't refuse So, I repeat my uncle's question. What d'you think? I'm cold, let's go in I show you my wife, you kill her, you come back, everyone's happy - Where's the problem? - I'm not a hit-man We know. That's why we're not paying you - What will make me? - Not much. Close your eyes Look. Imagine you're in a time machine "Is Vincent Baraduc guilty of killing his wife H?l?ne? "The jury finds him not guilty. Vincent Baraduc, you're free" - Ring a bell, pal? - We're pals? We soon will be. Why waste time? When you stood trial for killing yourwife and her lover... ...I slightly misled the jury so you would be acquitted - I sat on some experts' reports - Why? In my book, wife-killing isn't really murder And I thought one day I might need a guy like you And today's the day! If you refuse, I order a retrial In common parlance... We have you by the goolies Those reports prove you guilty, so if I dig them out... Oops, twenty years in jail What d'you say? Got a photo of yourwife? Damn, she's beautiful That doesn't help She'll be there Yes, women always run home to their mums - Been to Valence? - No It's charming. See, we even take you sightseeing You really can't complain You're quiet Living alone shrinks your vocab You're not alone now. We're here Listen, we really like you You sulking will spoil the trip Want a sweet? Strawberry, lemon, pineapple? - Whatever... pineapple - Good choice Trouble is, the lemon paper looks the same, and I hate lemon Got any other music? I only like this Sensual, isn't it? And fatalistic Does it have to be so loud? Yes, the volume knob's bust What the hell's that? What happened? We're lucky to be alive Why kill yourwife? She stops me living I was married forten years, now I want play But I can't. You're free of yourwife No questions asked I want the same. No questions That's stupid. All women stop men living If everyone did like you, there'd be no pussy left We don't say kill them all Just the ones who bother us personally The ones we're fool enough to live with You're in no position to argue I don't count, I've never been married - Never had sex? - 'Course. That's not the same My grandpa said "A good hand job beats a bad marriage" He mimed it as he spoke It made my grandma cry, but I thought he was right How can we help wondering if they're wearing bras? Or admiring a pretty bum in a summer skirt? Can I help it if women wear perfume? With Marie... - My wife's name was Marie - "Was"? She's not dead In my mind you've killed her Marie and I had some great times, but I rememberthe bad ones One shitty minute blots out a week's joy A bit of friction degenerates into an argument They watch us, smiling, waiting for mistakes Like refs with a yellow card Women are just a pain in the arse I disagree. I adore all women As long as we don't live with them Just look at that couple What did he do to deserve her? He had friends, life was good She spread her legs, and he traded his life for a moment's pleasure It's obvious. Men and women weren't made to live together We try, we hope But we're made for a quick wham, bam and goodbye... ...before we get hooked The joke is everybody knows it Look at your parents, friends But everyone thinks they can beat the odds That's how couples get married and end up hating each other You know how to depress a guy The worst thing is, I agree Of course you do. Look at them With three kids, he's had it. No more escape, no more fun And those two have bickered for 150 years without giving an inch See that little twit there Panting afterthe waitress because she wiggled her bum at him That one there interests me A nice girl stuck with a creep lmagine a lifetime with him He'll have affairs with sluts... ...just to prove something... ...while he has a treasure at home Look at his hands. Pig hands How many fannies has he groped? Disgusting! Don't exaggerate You'd have her pulling a gun and shooting her pig dead, that it? Once, ages ago, although it... Shit! Paul, the car Vincent, the girl. Nobody move Ladies and gentlemen. I'm a judge. It was self-defence You saw and heard nothing. It's a bad dream Step on it The volume knob's broken Tango's fatalistic, isn't it? Like a sweet? Take one. The pineapple... ...is delicious Here's a joke Look at us three A is going to kill B's wife underthe kindly eye of C Guess who's the killer? And who'll be the widower? Why kill anyone's wife? I can't forget her They asked me to do it You're a killer? No more than you are See? We've that in common My name's Madeleine Pretty name, Madeleine. It suits you - Was he your husband? - Yes - Know what the law says? - Not exactly, but I can guess - Are you afraid? - Yes, a bit My husband didn't exist for me. Shooting a ghost isn't a crime Why did a girl like you marry a guy like that? Maybe because I was bored. He sometimes made me laugh He didn't always drink beer, he weighed 20 kilos less Then one day, eating fish fingers, you take out a gun and kill him Why today? What good's a man who doesn't want children? Can I ask you a favour? Will one of you make me pregnant? I'm ovulating today He's stupid. He'll never even see the baby - Are you jealous? - Not at all I imagine them behind a bush Her, thighs wide, smiling Him, going in and out, white bum bobbing in the grass... ...fondling her breasts I couldn't have fucked her How d'you get a girl pregnant with yourwife on your back? He does as he pleases. I can't. It pisses me off Thank you - All right? - Yes, it's been ages How d'you know it'll work? You don't know till you try Once, ages ago, although it feels like yesterday... ...I hosted a dinnerwith all the women I'd loved but nevertold Some knew each other, but none knew why they were there I explained that at some point I'd loved each one of them But I hadn't told them for fear of ruining my life Most, being unhappily married, fully understood I looked them all over. Frankly, I had no regrets - Did you leave yourwife? - No, she left me last month So why kill her if she's off your back? She's right No, I can't bear her being alive without me She may be having fun, she's with another man... maybe several You don't understand I understand perfectly. You still love yourwife So? I hate it when she's there. When she's gone, I miss her At least when she's dead... Sensual music, isn't it? You dance well for a misogynist Who says I'm a misogynist? I love women, I don't want to live with one Why not? Maybe I'm afraid I won't make the grade. Who knows? So, how shall I kill her? Yourwife, how shall I do it? Search me. I've no idea Neither have I. You're the client. You choose What do I do? Strangle her? Stab her in the guts? Poison? Set her alight? Well? Decapitate her? Chain-saw? You're depressing me Tell me, will this kill a woman at point-blank range? We'll take it. How much? No ammo? Yes, you're right. The necessary, please I fish without a line so I shoot without bullets, eh? Skip the gift wrap. It's for now Don't mind him. He's like that. Bit of a joker Goodbye, Vincent Like it? I'm staying here I got a job in the dress shop where I bought this With luck, I'll be forgotten Not by everybody Not everybody Madeleine's going. She's bored. She'd rather sell dresses - We'll miss her - So soon? You dance well. We could've tried foxtrot, paso doble, bossa nova Well, let's say goodbye and skip the platitudes Thanks for everything - Will I know if you're pregnant? - No, it'll be my secret Goodbye, Madeleine. And stay away from creeps Promise Step on it Quick, I'm weakening Prevention is betterthan cure Hello, I'm a friend of Marie. I was in the area... ...so I was wondering if... If Paul sent you, tell that shitface to deliver his own messages No offence... ...but if he's a friend... ...I don't envy you Well? - Did you like Marie's mum? - Very much. Why? Nothing. She likes you too. But yourwife's not there - Where is she? - Too far for us to find Nice meeting you. I'm off home. You should go too Want to see your file? It's fascinating 20 years, minimum If I'm on form, it'd be 30. 30 years at your age... - You're bluffing - Think so? I wouldn't risk it. We still have you by the goolies We agreed to kill my nephew's wife, and we'll do it She's a million miles away Why bother finding her? She's gone for good - She ditched you. Forget her - No way A living wife, wherever she is, is always a threat So, where is she? In Africa with '"M?decins Sans Fronti?res'" The bitch! She's screwing a doc Well, you know what they say "Doctors Without Borders. Nurses without knickers" So the three of us set off, bound for Africa North orSouth? We didn't care Trouble was, ever since I lost my wife looping the loop... ... I swore I'd never again get in a plane It seems ludicrous driving down to Africa in a station wagon Were we in so little hurry to kill Paul's wife? Perhaps The truth was we got on well together We didn't want to break up too soon It was like a holiday Days without schedules, silence without nagging... ... vulgarity without guilt... ... the promise of good times, without women We haven't come very far What's the rush? In a hurry to be widowed? What a waste. That waitress What a waste An angel I knew a place where the waitress was the owner's wife One day he asked her not to wear any knickers It turned him on thinking of her waiting on tables like that Somehow the word got out and the restaurant was packed She was a beauty and the thought of her bare bum turned us on, too Funny, eh? D'you think she does the same? - Men are one-track minded - Aren't you? Of course, that's how I know men are one-track minded Sandrine, stop driving me crazy You know my name? You're really called Sandrine? I've never been so moved Think of all those bedrooms. Mine's 212. Will you come? Perhaps My cat's called Sandrine. She's pretty too Thank you - I don't think she'll come - Why not? You didn't do it right Did you sleep around? A bit. Actually... not much - But when she's dead, I will - How very male They think if they were single they'd fuck non-stop. Crap! Look at all these guys dying to get laid tonight But none will make a move Like to bet? Pick any single woman here, the prettierthe better In underthree minutes I'll get her upstairs If I fail, you can go home That one Excuse me, Madame, may I sit down for a minute? Be my guest I'm with two friends overthere, and we made this stupid bet I bet them I could sit down at yourtable... ...and within three minutes... ...we'd walk out of the restaurant and up to your room So would you walk out of here up to the first floorwith me? I'd like to win my bet Your bet's so unrealistic it's ludicrous How could a man like you seduce a woman like me so fast? I know, but I can't back out. I've bet a lot of money All right. I've finished my meal. You can escort me out. Let's go Not yet. It must be plausible. I said three minutes As you wish. Let's chat - Do you come here often? - No, not very Me neither It's very hot forthis time of year, don't you think? Yes, but... this is the South Well, I think... that should do it. Shall we go? - What do you know! - That you're not going home No, please, let's use the stairs. So I can be with you longer My room's on the third floor. Can you face all those stairs? Yes, willingly It's a shame it's just a bet If I had the nerve to seduce you, we'd be climbing these stairs... ...and I'd be admiring your legs, your behind... And aren't you? Yes, but it's all for nothing I could have described your swaying hips... ...memorized your undulating back... ...basked in your perfume Paul's taken care of, I may be lucky with the waitress What about you, my poor friend? I'm going to order dessert, a huge one, maybe two Then I'll have a brandy from the mini-bar And watch a porno film on cable TV Know what? I'll probably be the happiest of the three We would have reached the third floor Not out of breath because we'd have walked up slowly We'd have gone down the corridor Good evening Madame, Monsieur We'd have reached my room I'd have put my key in the lock, and opened it Well, goodbye and thank you You've beaten your friends. But you can't quit now I've made a bet, too I can't tell you what it is forthe moment. Come in Look, I'd love to but... I'm married, soon to be widowed I'm married too. You know, everybody is these days But... I can't see my husband, nor yourwife - Oh, it's you. What's up? - Get dressed - What time is it? - 5.30 Paul's not in his room. Don't like it - Where is he? - I've no idea But I said I don't like it. That's all Maintenance here. There's a leak in your bathroom Paul, we've a long drive ahead. Be downstairs in 6 minutes Was it good? Was it good? Forgive me, but it's my wife you've been screwing... ...forthe past six hours So I wondered if it was good - Yourwife? - Didn't she say? She's ashamed of me, she always has been We've been married for 20 years I was never good enough But I can't live without her What would become of me? I'm boring you Not at all. But I'm in a hurry, my uncle's waiting Her family's rich, she rents hotel rooms forthe year I work as a bellboy just to be near her Bellboy, at my age! Lmagine it Each year a different hotel Cannes, Biarritz, Deauville - I forget where else Always luxurious places. She loves luxury Well, you saw her room. Superb, isn't it? But don't let me keep you How many lovers has she had? I'd say 200, maybe more Next morning I do the room, change the warm fragrant sheets I don't airthe room; to savour the scents of her night Sometimes she's in the shower I hearthe water streaming over her body I'll be changing the sheets you screwed her in - Did you make a lot of mess? - Not too much - Look, I'm sorry - Don't be. It's my fault I made the best of a bad job. I deserve it, I assure you - Which is your room? - 417 Nice room. You should see the staff quarters Well, here's your room I've considered suicide, but what would happen to her? Goodbye, Monsieur I won't ask "Was it good"? No, don't ask I won't ask you, either No, don't In case you're wondering, and despite appearances... ...for me it was good OK, I lost the bet so I still have to kill yourwife But what's the point? She didn't stop you screwing last night. Be logical No! You can't be logical with women Why do we fall in and out of love with them? I just want to understand You can't. And that's that What the hell's he up to? You ran out of petrol, OK But when we flip a coin and the old boy loses... ...you grumble that he's slow That's a bit much! Here he is Shit! My wife. She was in that truck I swear. Marie was in the truck, next to the driver - You dreamed it - I did not. I saw it Marie ran off with a lorry driver. Come on - Will someone explain? - No. Get in Paul saw his wife in a lorry that went past Marie? Yes, Marie. I've only got one wife So "nursing the poor" in Africa means humping truckers What a nit I am Hey, watch out! Shut up I'm OK. I'll teach that shitface Cool it, Paul, don't get excited I'm cool as ice. Who's excited? Marie, get down You don't scare me But I'm not after you. I want my wife I want her out here. Now! Should we help? No... we do nothing D'you hear, Marie? Get out Get the fuck out What d'you want with my girl? I thought you were in Africa I'm going. He's giving me a lift This ape? Lunatic I'm talking to my wife Yourwife? The guy's a comedian. That's rich Marie, let's start again. Forgive me Come back Please No, Paul, it's over. I'm sorry. We can't go backwards I'll brain him Come on. Don't be afraid Stop it. You're grotesque Get him, Raymond. Beat him to a pulp - Grab my chick, eh? - It's all a mistake Fancy her, do you? He mistook your lady Ah, now he says she looks like any old bird? Go on, Raymond, kill them Hang on tight Next time you see yourwife in a car or a UFO... ...keep it to yourself, OK? So I made a mistake That's an understatement. You're off your head Step on it I won't rest until we shake off that loony My foot's right down Shit So long, you fags - What year is your car? - '70 Are spare parts easy to get? This is stupid Your uncle talked you into it. Now you can't back out, can you? You're killing yourwife to please your uncle Odd kind of family spirit - That's not the point - I know it's not Look at me. I killed my wife. Did it make me happier? No Call it off. It's forthe best Let's stop. Hey, Elegance! Listen to Paul Tell him, you'll feel better Look, I've been thinking I can see that from your face You don't want to kill Marie. You had a revelation... ...at the roadside OK, I agree. You're right Here, let me show you something Pascal Labadie, 36, surgeon Pierre Lassalle, 32, anaesthetist And how about Alain Gosset? Age 30, nurse. Nice-looking, eh? - What's all this? - Nothing Just showing you Marie's colleagues. Which one do you prefer? No, I mean which one will Marie prefer for starting a new life? To father her children? Get the picture? It's unbearable, isn't it? Listen to my nephew He's been thinking. About Marie. It's still on Shit. Fuck. God damn it! What's wrong, son? Cracking up? Yes, I'm sick of this shit. We kill her, we don't, we do She's the end of the world, we've no car, yet we carry on Just look at the three of us At what? Three men hitch-hiking on a sunny day. What's wrong? What's wrong is, even if an idiot finally gives us a lift... ...we cram ourselves in an Avis rent-a-car... ...and next week we're still in southern Spain lt'll take years to widow you I'm sick of this shit Want to kill her? Let's do it Is there an airfield nearby? Move over. Get the hell in Didn't you quit flying? This is an emergency Remember how it works? I'll soon find out Shouldn't we gain height? I can't Technical problem? Personal problem Vertigo Well, you get a better view If we crash, it's not farto fall Is it her? Sure this time? - No second thoughts? - It's too late forthat - OK? - Yes, I'm fine I loaded the gun with blanks - Idiot! Why do that? - Don't know. I just did I've a hunch you loaded blanks Am I right? Why come all this way? Leave it to me. I'm right - Are you Marie? - Yes Your husband Paul sent me He asked me to kill you. I don't want to But for complicated reasons, I can't refuse I see. But I really don't know what to say Ready? There. You're a free man Like it? Brill And your friend? She wants to be an air hostess Well? Was it fun? You won't do that in a 747 Sure you don't want to be a pilot? I'm sure - See you Sunday - 'Bye What a lovely age Yes, too bad they grow up Coffee, cream, biscuits... ...sponge, p?t?, Ajax... - Coming shopping? - No, Paul's staying I'm teaching him apple tart. It's fortonight With a scoop of vanilla. Never forget the vanilla See you later This is the life Even in autumn it's still warm If it does get a bit chilly... ...we'll light a fire and you'll play the guitar Cheer up, I'm only kidding lt'll be great, you'll see We'll eat fat meat, chicken skin, buttered potatoes We'll get fat, but who cares? We've only ourselves to please There'll be just us We'll tell dirty jokes... ...allow swearwords in Scrabble, hold dick contests We'll fart when we want You know... about Marie I wonder... I wonder, that's all Don't worry, lad. It'll pass. It always does Hello. How are you? What the hell are you doing? You're mad D'you want to ruin everything? I won't. Don't worry I just want to know something Now I'm dead, is Paul happier? It's hard to say You may not like this But yes, he's doing alright He gets a bit depressed but not for long. It's OK Ever mention me? Or rather, yes Sometimes. In his sleep So you didn't tell him? Will you? I don't think so What's your name? Goodbye, Vincent Yourturn, Vincent Yourwife was beautiful. I forgot to tell you I know. Why say that? I think of her. I wonder if we did the right thing I mean, if I hadn't killed her and she'd returned to France... ...she might've tracked you down to see how you are without her She might've moved here We might've met in the supermarket She might've wanted to come back At least we'd be four for Scrabble That's why I was wondering Even when they're dead, they're a pain in the arse
