May there be peace for all! May there be holiness for all! May there be happiness for all! May there be well-being for all. May there be peace for all. May there be holiness for all. May there be happiness for all. Om. How 'bout I join you for some downward doggie style? How was work? '71 Chevelry belt, sweet bitch. Cool. Is that how you spent your day? It's one in a new series I'm starting. Oh. It looks like a thing exploded. I'm gonna need new paints. Yeah, these shorts get me every time. You should clean up and get ready for the party. No, no, I don't wanna be dirty. I wanna shower. We got hours before the party. No, it's not a good time. It's a good time for me. Do you wanna shower first? Yeah, whatever. If we get to my uncle's party early, we can say hi to my cousins and then leave. He's even gonna pay for our ride. Whatever. Shane, please don't be like... Whatever! Go take your shower! If you wanna shower with me, I'll make sure you get clean. Hell yeah. Hey. Found these. Going back to school? I wanna finish my degree. For what? Drawing pictures? To get more options. Who's gonna pay for it? My scholarship is still good. Nothing's free. This is bullshit you're hiding this from me. I wasn't hiding it. You think you're so much smarter than me, huh? The world is friggin' Candy Land. Let's talk about this later. No, no, we're not going to your uncle's party, all right? That broken ass family of yours, that's what you should wanna run away from, not me. I'm not trying to, no! Fuck. God fuck, fuck, fuck! Now look what you made me do! Get out. I live here, all right, I'm not going anywhere. Lu. Trick or treat. I'm a driver for Cart, I'm here for Lulu, are you Lulu? Here we go. - Nice costume. - Thanks. What are you supposed to be? Little Red Riding Hood. Oh, food for grandma's house, I get it. Nice, nice. You probably goin' to a party or something, huh? Yeah, I wish I was. Gotta drive all night. So... Where's your wolf? No wolf. Oh yeah? That's too bad. You look kinda sad, everything okay? I'm okay. You sure? I'm not really doing my job if you're not smiling, you know? Why don't you give me a little smile, just, just a little one? Come on. Just like a little smile, just. Turn that frown upside down. Yeah. You have such beautiful lips. Wow. I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in. Right? Yeah, that's it. Just like that. - So. - Mm? Your daughter has something she'd like to ask you. Oh, see, my daughter is definitely your daughter. Yes, but see, I was never this honorary. Mm. Sweetheart, your mom says you have something to ask me? Do you remember how you suggested we build a tree house? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. How about an underground bunker? A fallout shelter instead. Oh, it, why, why would we need a fallout shelter? It'd be way better than a tree house for terrorist attacks that off grid destroying nukes. Or what if bacteria infested meteorite hits Earth and it triggers a pandemic of zombism? Yes, honey, I mean think about it. A bunker does sound like a very practical idea. - A pan, pan... - Demic, pandemic. Zombism huh? It goes to Provlo Lose prepares for every given scenario. Real or imagined. What she said. Oh, see I imagine you don't need a fallout shelter, I think we're fine. I'll draw up the blueprints for you to look over. You see that, she didn't even, just like didn't really... No, no. Just kind of right over me - and just like... - That's your daughter. - Well, really. - Your daughter. No, yours. Okay, all right, listen. Let's get crackin' on those. We gonna look at those plans, how 'bout that? Help, help me, somebody! Help, help, somebody! Help, somebody, please! Look. You need help. You obviously need help, I mean. Look, I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you. Hey. Look, I'm gonna call the police, you just have to tell me what happened. They... They? Oh! You need to sit back, sit back. It's okay. No, no, no. It's okay, I got it, relax. God damn it. May I help you? Yeah, we were in a really bad accident just up the road and my sister, she's autistic amongst other things and she hit her head and she took off hurt. From the way she took off, I thought maybe she'd come through her, have you seen her? Have you called the police? Yeah, yeah, we have. They said it would take awhile, you know, and I just couldn't wait around, you know. Do you have a cabin in the area? Yeah, our friend does. Do I know him? It's pretty far. You know, you two seem to be all right for being in an accident. That's weird how that happens sometimes. May we come in? You know, I'm gonna give the police a ring for you. I also have a buddy that's a forest ranger, they do a good job out here. Thank you, I appreciate that. Yeah, yeah. I'm really thirsty, you mind if I just come in for a glass of water? Look, I'll bring one out to you. Wait here. No problem. I've called the police. They're on their way. No offense, I'd like you to leave my property. You can wait at the end of the driveway. May I get my glass of water? He has a gun. Oh. Well that's very observant. I'm also black, with a really nice cabin in the woods. We won't take any more of your time, okay. Come on, baby. Please don't shoot us. I'll try not to. Hey, if you're in the bathroom, you can come out. I'm going to the police. Are those, those have been hunting you? I took a Cart to my uncle's house Halloween party and... Cart, you mean like a golf cart? No, no, it's a phone app, like you call someone and they pick you up in their car like a taxi. Wait, those men are taxi drivers? No, the driver, he was touching himself. Touching himself, is he one of them? I don't know, he was in a clown costume and he picked me up and he said that we had to go pick up another passenger. It was out of the way when we got there. That's when they attacked me. You're bleeding. He cut me all over. Why? Why? And you got a limp. I twisted my ankle when I was running. Okay, can I look at it? Look, you can sit on the bed. Listen, don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. I don't wanna make a mess. No, no, it's okay, it's okay, come on. I'll take it. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Look, I can tend to this ankle but we need to hurry. I'm gonna get you a wash cloth. You may not want to shower, if there's evidence. This isn't my shirt, I don't want it. Okay, I'm just gonna go ahead in here, okay? I think you and my wife wear the same size. We gotta get out of here. Neil! We gotta go. You let her go on purpose, didn't you? No. You got some kind of sicko fantasy about the two of you runnin' off and livin' happily ever after, huh, you fucking pervert. Maybe he's right. Maybe we should just go. Go, where are we gonna go, Snack, huh? You want me back in the penitentiary? No. This wasn't part of the deal. No, the deal is you finish what you started and we clean up the evidence, that's the deal. Come on, man, we don't even know if she's in there. She's in there. He said he called the cops. Cut the phone line. Oh, he cut the phone line. Well maybe he called another way, huh? Well there's still time to tidy up. Mm-mm, no, no, it's too risky. Did you use a condom when you fucked her, Chad? Baby, baby. Go get my pistol out the back of my truck. We'll see what this guy's made of. You can come in, please. Keep your eyes open and your mouth closed. They'll be coming out soon. Well when they finally come out, don't shoot Lu. Just make sure I don't shoot you. Shit. I hear something. I don't see them, now's our chance. Stay back, okay? Go, go, go, go! - Are you okay? - They shot at us! You have guns, you were in the military, you can fight them off. I have this gun and it is fairly new and no military, I was a floor manager at a brick plant. A brick plant? We made bricks mostly! - I took early retirement. - Okay. - I'm Dylan Troyson. - Lulu. Lulu, okay, so Lulu, it's a far walk from town, they cut the only landline to this house and I'm running out of bullets in this gun. Okay, what are we gonna do? Try not to faint. I don't feel so good. No, listen, it's not over. I got more bullets in the bedroom, okay? - Come on. - Okay. I think I've been shot. - What? - It burns. Let me see it. Ah, shit. Ah, baby, it grazed right through, baby. That's bad, she should go to a hospital. I dig chicks with scars. You guys are sick, you're gettin' off on this. You disgust me, pussy. I think I saw a first-aid kit in Chad's car. I can bandage this up. It's starting to numb already. I'll keep an eye on the cabin. Go with her. Yeah, go. And bring back that gas can. I'll give diplomacy one more chance. We should figure out how we're gonna get you to town. I have a feeling that's the last we're gonna see of them. I got up today and I didn't even tune in on the news. I didn't bother to catch on to whatever cancers and the chem trails or crazy lizard people conspiracies. Shit. I left my phone behind. But I was peaceful. And it started out as one of the best days I've had in a very long time. I'm sorry. All I have is cold bacon, please, please have some. Oh no, I'm vegetarian. Well you need your strength. And you know other animals they eat meat, so. I feel that humans have taken on the responsibility of a higher spiritual consciousness and eating animals as food is unnecessary. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I also heard? I heard that plants communicate with each other when they're in danger. You know, like, ah. I won't judge you for eating bacon if you don't judge me for eating plants. Okay, fair enough, here. Bread is vegetarian, hm? Mm-hm. We really shouldn't be here if he called the cops. He wouldn't try to make a run for it if he had called the cops. This isn't what I wanted. I thought it would be like a double date. Well, what does your wife think about this? Maybe if you invite her and the kids along. Neil does not know how to treat a woman. For god's sake he calls you a snack. Yeah, well, I'm his jellybean and he's my gummy bear. He's wrong. You've been shot, you need to see a doctor. So, you think that me and you, we should just jump in the car and take off? You can convince him, Snack, you could convince him. Neil protected your ass in prison. I paid. Yeah, well you may be able to betray your family, Chaddy Chad, but you're not gonna convince me to betray mine. - Got it? - Yeah. Now, the good thing about livin' out one fantasy in your head is it makes room for a new one. Let's go play. Hey cabin boy! Let me know you can hear me. Hey look, I'm unarmed, I'm unarmed. Ain't nobody comin' for you, man. Ain't no phones out here. Can't nobody hear you. You're not gettin' out of this fucking place. You understand? What do you want, huh? Why are you protecting that bitch, she's ours. We're both men, right, so let's deal like men. How about a 10% finder's fee, huh? You found her fair and square, I get that. I'll even throw in a little extra for the truck. Look, you don't know me and I don't know you, okay? I know you don't know what we're capable of. Just let the girl go, give her to us and you can stay here and everything will be fine. Last warning, you come any closer, and I will shoot you! I will burn this place to the fucking ground! Son of a bitch. If that's what you want, okay. Then you all die here! Nobody gets out! You hear me, nobody! God damn it! Fuck. How'd you know he wouldn't shoot you? Normal people don't shoot people in cold blood, baby. What makes you think that man's normal? He didn't shoot me. He might now if we try to rush him again though. We'll wait him out, let him stress and crack. How long? We'll wait until dark, then we'll go in and get him. No, we got a lot of hours before it's dark. You are just giving that man time to fortify his defenses. I'm done giving him clear targets. You want Snack to take another bullet for you, fat boy? Don't have to be so hurtful, Neil. I'm just stressed, I'm retaining water. I'm sorry I didn't shoot him when I had the chance. This is all my fault. Don't say that, we need a plan. We need to make sure the windows and the doors are locked. Look, do you know how to use a gun? No. Okay, so let me show you, see, the bullets in this gun are the only ones left. I can't. It's simple. No, I can never use a gun. Look, they have guns, this is our answer for that. Please don't make me. You may have to! Look, it's just like my daughter used to say, okay, she'd say, "Dad, I won't always be here to protect you. "So you gotta use the bullet." Oh. Holy shit. Lulu, what do you know about the zombie apocalypse? I don't. It's the undead and they roam the Earth and they feed off the brains of the living. Okay, so anyway, my daughter, she made it her hobby to prepare for the zombie apocalypse. So if zombies ever attacked this cabin, she would have defensive measures. Okay, look, we might as well go crazy, right. Might as well go all out. Let's start with the locks and doors, come on. Hey, you okay in there? - Lulu? - I'm fine, I'm fine. If you need any Aspirin, it's in there and I'll just stay out here in case you need me. ♪ There once was a girl with eyes of dream ♪ ♪ I cut her throat to stop her scream ♪ ♪ Pain of little death it begs ♪ ♪ Tongue to lick between her legs ♪ ♪ To taste the pulse of memory ♪ ♪ To make her come inside of me ♪ ♪ Come, come inside of me ♪ ♪ Come, come inside of me ♪ You knew what I was about when you invited me to party.

You don't want pets. You want treats. You eat 'em and throw away the wrapper. Is that what you're doing with Snack? It's the only woman I let hold my knife. She's my ride or die, it's different. Does she got a sister? I'll let you fuck the girl one more time. Then you get rid of her. And if I don't, you're gonna kill me? I'm gonna kill you if you don't. What if I make a trade? What? You make my wife and kids disappear. What's that worth? My wife has a fat bank account. We can talk about that on down the road. You could run her off the road, make it look like an accident.

Now this, she made this because I wouldn't buy her an ax. God. The pictures around the house, that's your daughter? Yeah, that's Sofia. You actually remind me a lot of her, you're very brave. No, I'm not. I'm gonna do what I can to get you back to your family. There's not much more of that. My mom and I aren't close, my dad was killed in prison. He and my uncle had some sort of embezzling scheme or something. When my uncle got out, he promised he would take care of me. Spent a lot of time with him and my cousins. Look, family isn't always perfect, but you gotta hold on to what you got. My uncle, Chad, he... He's one of those men out there. It was his Halloween party I was supposed to go to. So he must've sent that driver. They kept me tied up and blindfolded most of the time, but... I could hear voices and I'm sure it was him. He raped me. Get down, get down! Okay, let's move, that way, come on, come on. Now they know we're still out here. Thatta keep their nerves itchin'. - Gave me a boner. - Yeah, baby. I love you with a gun. They're toying with us. I should go out there and hunt them down. No, please don't leave me. Zombie defenses. It just seems so silly now. You're doing the best you can. I mean maybe we can wait them out. The only problem is they aren't zombies. They're vampires, you have to invite them in. We need to make it seem like it's their idea where to come inside. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna take a piss. If you shake it more than twice, you're playing with it. Eat my shit. You know, if you wanna cut me sometimes, you can. Well somebody's crazy. Inconsiderate motherfuckers, I got better shit to do than standing in these fucking woods. The fuck you smiling about? Where's the pervert? Chad. Chadwick. Where'd the pervert go? Are you gonna cry now? Are you gonna cry, little baby? Well then stay here and watch the house. There, there. Where you goin', huh? Hey, Neil. Where you goin', huh? The fuck you goin'? Hey, Neil. So glad to see you. I got lost, I thought maybe you were hungry. We could get some hot dogs and eat 'em. Yeah, go back to your cabin in your car, keep me out of money? No, no, no, no. Why would you? Is that what you were gonna do, huh? Huh, you think you're just gonna run off, leave me to clean it up, huh? Where you goin' now, huh, where you goin' now, huh? Yeah, you like that. You think you're smarter than me? Neil, Neil, Neil, listen. Is that what you think? Yeah, this is where you die, right here. Neil, listen. I don't wanna kill her. I don't wanna kill. - What? - I don't wanna kill her. - You have to kill her. - She's family! What are you talking about? She's family. The fuck you talking about family? What do you mean she's family? - She's my niece. - What? - She's my niece. - She's your niece? - Yes. - She knows who you are? - She's my niece. - What are you talking about? Oh, you dirty old man. you don't love anybody, you piece of shit! Get on your feet! - I got a plan. - Get on your feet. I got a plan. - Empty your pockets. - I got a plan. What are you talking about? Just get the gun out of my face. I'll tell you, I got a plan. What, what? These are your last words, so say 'em very carefully. Okay. Shane. Who's Shane? Her boyfriend. She does everything he says. She will come out of the cabin for him, I guarantee it. Just please, easy peasy, Japanesey. Stop pointing the fucking gun at me. Please, please. No, you're lying again. No, no, no, no, - I wouldn't lie to you. - You're lying again. Piece of shit. Oh fuck, stop hitting, please, please, - please. - Come on. - That's it, get up. - Please. - I'll be your ride or die. - Empty your pockets. Empty your pockets, to get your ID. Sit on the ground right there. Get out of the suit. Take off your clothes. I don't want to take off the clothes. Take off your clothes right now. Neil, it's not necessary, I'm your ride or die. Fuck! Jesus, okay, okay, okay. Okay, fuck. All right, it's coming, okay. Off with the pants. - No. - Take 'em off. - No. - Now. No. Pants are comin' off. We gotta finish what we started, right. We can do it. The fucking pants off now. Okay, okay. Put the fucking gun down. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. I got it, oh, god damn it. You wanna act like a little bitch huh? No, no, no, no. Is that what you wanna do? You wanna act like a little bitch? 'Cause I said so, that's why. Think you're gonna lie to me, huh? - No, I'm not. - You think you're gonna trick me again, huh? - I would never. - Is that what you think? - I would never lie to you. - You bitch. You think that's what you're gonna do, huh? No, no, no, wait. You're gonna get the boy and you're gonna get my fucking money. Okay. And now do you understand? Do you understand now, huh? How do you like that, bitch? How you wanna be punked? fucking punked, huh? Almost there! Okay, the carpet is there to cover the pressure plate. See Sofia's mother was an engineer and then she became a teacher, Nadine. She, she... I'm going back to college to finish my art degree. I don't know what careers I might explore, I just... I know I've been living in a dead end for far too long. What kind of art? I paint, abstract mostly. I'm proud of you. You don't even really know me. Yeah, well, I know something. I know that you were drug in hell and pulled yourself out. I've got goals, I guess. Yeah. It's all set. You actually got a signal. One bar, he's gonna GPS his way over here. Man can't even disappear in the middle of nowhere anymore. Well, let's go tell Snack what you're up to. If this doesn't work then the barrel up your butt's gonna be the highlight of your day. Come on, let's go, make it snappy, let's go. Who's that guy? I told you about him, he's the man who owns the cabin. Explain all that again. Kid, whatever fight you had with my niece, it threw her over the edge. I told her she can come stay with us, no problem, but next thing I know, she's raiding the medicine cabinet having who knows what coming to the house delivering things. Lu doesn't do drugs. Pills, man, everybody does pills. I know about you. You probably slipped her something. Kid, this is not fuck around time. She stole a car, she crashed it, then she broke into that guy's cabin and now she's holed up in there with some guy and they're acting crazy and suicidal. Some guy? Yeah, I don't know, her drug dealer probably. We need you to get her to come out to us. Take me to her. Go on up ahead, I'll be right behind you. Okay, we got company, do you recognize them? I'm not sure. She will show, you go with him. What? Just, come on. Lulu! It's your uncle. I'm here with Shane. We heard you were in trouble, we wanna help. Lu! It's Shane! Look, they're telling me some crazy stories out here. If you're in there, talk to me. Who is that? It's my boyfriend, Shane. Wait a minute, is he working with your uncle? No, he wouldn't. Baby, I love you, I really messed up this time, I know! Will you please just talk to me. We talked to the police. I'm gonna make it all better, baby. He can get us out of here. No, it's a trap. I hurt you, I never meant to hurt you but I did. The way I've been acting, I can fix all that. You should feel appreciated, if you'll just give me a chance, I just wanna get you home safe. Look, I don't like it, I don't like it at all. Let's get back into the house, come on, come on! This is stupid. I'm gonna try and go and get her. No. Don't! Fuck. The hell is your problem? Tell 'em to come out of the cabin or I'll shoot the boyfriend. Lu, they're gonna shoot me. Hey, kid, come over here. Who are you? You move, you're dead. Move and you're dead. - I'll go out there. - No, no, no! They'll kill you both. You have five seconds until I shoot this kid. You got five seconds before they shoot the kid! Please, we have to do something! Okay, okay. Shane, Shane run over to me! Come on! I don't have a shot! Shane, run! Shane! They're gonna kill me because of you. You selfish useless prick! Don't hurt Lu. It's too late for that. You heard her. How long have you known her? I loved her since she was a child. Get your hands off of there. You don't get to move in on her. Ruin her life, ruin everybody's life. You shit! You shit, you shit! Get in the backseat, Chad. Get the keys then, Chad. Take your pants off, Chad! Yippee, yippee. Hooray for Chad. Hooray for Chad. They'll be coming in soon. Hey, hey, hey, look, look, just calm down all right? You're here, you're safe, I'm here with you. Just let me go back and check on Shane. Okay, we have four bodies, all of the vehicles and both cabins to burn. Can't we keep one of the cabins? No, anything the perv touched is dead weight, just like him. We should've went and bought gas. I told you to get gas. Hey, guys. Where's the boyfriend? I took care of that. Yeah, we'll see about that. The three of us are going to that cabin right now, finishing this job. Let's go. Let's go. Is he dead? Yes. I'm sorry, I tried to, I tried to, hey breathe, please, breathe, breathe, breathe. Stay with me, please, Lulu, stay with me. We'll mourn him when we survive this. We'll mourn him when we survive this, I need you to just calm down, okay? What do you think? Keep your voice down, you idiot. Look, look, I can hear better out there, all right? So I'm right outside the door. No, no, listen, listen, listen, listen, you stay here until I give the okay. You scream, you scream if you need me, all right? I'll be right out here. Looks too good to be true. I'm gonna need the flashlight. Shut the fuck up! Look, I'm okay, okay, you all right? Just stay tight. Keep going, I'll find another way. Okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. We gotta go. We're fucked over. I gotta go to a hospital. - Where's Neil? - He's inside. We're going back in. You got an arrow in your arm. No, really? Hold on, I got an idea. There we go. Here. What are you doing? I'm gonna snip snap. You dumb fuck! No, no, no, no, it's gonna hurt. I can take it, I birthed two kids. Now quit being a sniveling dick, Chad, and grow yourself a pussy. I'm out, all right, so get ready to plunge. You do what I say or I'll swipe you open. I grabbed the girl. Get off of him or I'm gonna cut her throat. Motherfucker, you're gonna pay. Motherfucker, you're gonna pay. Now sit on the couch. Get over there, sit down! Let me kill this one. No, no, no, no, don't, don't, look. Look, you let her go, I'll pay you. She's already spoken for but I'll hear your offer. Where's Uncle Chad? He's outside. I love this song, reminds me of good times. I see you, get in here. What makes you so special, huh? Why does everybody care so much? Why are they so in love with you, huh? Why are you so special they're gonna pay? How much, how much, huh? 100 grand! 100 grand, what are you, a mountain man of Wall Street, huh, you some kind of rapper or somethin'? Lulu. Oh, Lu. My little strawberry. It's your, it's your Uncle Chad, you're safe now. Put her on the couch, set her down. Get over here. Sit down! Give me my knife. It's mine. Give me. Look, look, they're gonna kill us no matter what, okay? Shut the fuck up! His offer's better than yours. So I'll make you a deal. You two, you fight to the death. And whoever wins gets to fuck the girl once last time. Oh, yeah, yeah. No more boy games. I'm gonna have scars. If I have to remember this, then I want my fucking cake, get over here! Yeah, baby, yeah. Yeah. - Come here. - Move! Closer. She came crying to her uncle's party. The man, he tried to show me his pee pee. I didn't know what to do. Boo hoo. The pee pee monster's gonna get me. You're just another victim who can't stop spreading her legs. You're so broken. I'm gonna cut your dumb, dull head off. I'm not broken! May there be well-being for all, may there be peace for all. May there be holy for all, and may there be happiness for all. Lulu. Hold it. Lu! After all I've done for you. Behave! I told you, didn't I? Didn't I, you son of a bitch! Let's go. No, no, no! Come on, come on, you have to get up, okay? You have to get up. You have to get up. I have nothing, okay, wait, wait. No, go, go, go, oh, you can't put an eight on a 10. You can put an eight on a seven. No, no, wait, that's an eight. Nadine, my wife, she died of a brain aneurism. The last time I spoke to her. - Mom, Mom! - We had a big argument - because I wouldn't... - Mom! Take work off to get here on the same day. Mom! - They were all alone. - Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom! Sofia, she couldn't wait for help. She carried her mother out of the cabin and tried to drive her to the hospital. My baby. She crashed. And crashed. And they died because of me. Because of my stubbornness. I walk through these halls, there's nothing. I walk through this house, there's nothing. I put a gun in my mouth, what is it, what reason do I have to live? I'm only alive because of you. Oh, no, no, no. See, you're like my baby. You're like my girl. She's a fighter, you're a fighter, you're a fighter. You're a good dad and you are a good man.
