There you go. ♪ And still need help somehow ♪ Merry Christmas, hi! ♪ I'm not a child ♪ ♪ But my heart still can dream ♪ Merry Christmas! Hi. It's beautiful, isn't it? The lights... the music... It's my favourite time of the year. I'm pretty sure you're contractually obligated to say that, wearing that suit. Suit? What suit? This is just me on a Tuesday. Aren't you kinda young for Santa? I mean, I usually picture him with a little more seniority. Maybe a bit more of a gut. I'll let you in on a little secret. It's the Christmas spirit that keeps me young. That and a strict jogging routine. Okay. Good night. Hey, um... Mind if I get your name? It's not on your list? I thought you checked that thing twice. Well, the elves have been slacking a bit this year. They're a bit behind on their paperwork. Got it. You blame the elves. Okay. It's Taylor. Taylor Nichols. Taylor Nichols. Oh, yes, I remember now. Yes, I did spot that name on my list. And was it on the "nice" column, or the "naughty" column? You know, I've come here just about as far back as I can remember, but I don't remember ever seeing you here. Well, Santa, that's 'cause it's my first Christmas back since... Since I left a few years ago. Well, let Santa be the first one to welcome you back. So, Taylor Nichols, what do you want Santa to bring you this year? I'm sorry, I have to get going. My grandfather's expecting me at his store, so... Come on, everyone has a Christmas wish. Something they want more than anything else in the world. What is it? Some Christmas wishes just can't be granted. No matter how bright the lights, or how beautiful the tree. Christmas isn't about bright lights and ribbons. It's about a feeling you get inside. The feeling that even the most unlikely Christmas wish could come true. Taylor Nichols, whatever that Christmas wish is, I hope it comes true. Candy cane? Ho-ho-ho. Oh, Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho! Wait, I didn't get your... Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Name. Santa. Frank: Merry Christmas. Grandpa Frank! Excuse me one moment. There she is! Welcome home, kiddo! Oh, it's so good to see you! You too! How you doing, you doing okay? You're not too tired? Those bus trips can take everything out of you. No, I'm good, I'm good. I'm just happy to be back here. I'm sorry it was so last-minute. Work has been crazy. That editor of yours still cracking the whip? Like Santa with his reindeer. You know it. It's busy in here. Last minute Christmas rush. And it's just you? Had trouble finding help. Why don't I stay and help and you and I close up together? No, no, you're on vacation. Come on. Grandpa, there's nowhere else I'd rather be than right here with you. I was hoping you'd say that. Got one just your size! I love it. Woman: That's for you... Man: Okay, thank you. And... and... Go, go, go, go, go! Yes! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Charlie: Hey, Luke! Home just in time. Why don't you take a seat and grab one of those glue guns and help us out. Your mom and I are on a roll. Yes, we just broke our old record by 15 seconds. Wow. So if you could handle the pasting, wreath-laying, and tissue paper, and Charlie takes care of tinsel and chocolate, I think we can get there in under a minute. Charlie: Remember what I taught you. The secret to the perfect Christmas gift basket is structure. It's all about a solid foundation of chicken-wire. Lets the wicker hold the weight ten times. Yes, Dad, I remember. You taught me well. And how was your night? Did you make any Christmas wishes come true? It was pretty good. Yeah? Yeah, I made a lot of kids laugh. And a few adults, too. Ah! Well, it's a very nice thing you did tonight. The world could always use a little more holiday cheer, and more men in uniform. And... Charlie, are you sure you washed this thing out after last Christmas? I am putting this in the laundry. Speaking of uniforms, son... I just heard from my old friend, Clay Murphy. Colonel Clay Murphy? That's right. Seems you're impressing all the right people out there. I heard promotion chatter. Promotion? I thought that would have taken years to achieve. Honey, Luke just got home. Do we really need to talk about him leaving? No, you're certainly right. Hey, Peggy, would you please pass me the packing tape? And Luke? Do you mind getting me another one of these eggnogs? You know that that's my Christmas wish. Do you guys have any more of those baskets? Preferably one that's candy cane-themed? Uh.. oh, yes! Will this one do? That's perfect. Frank: What a day. Thanks for closing up with me. Nothing like a bowl of hot and sour soup on Christmas Eve. Reminds me of your mother. Yeah. She knew how to appreciate the good things in life, your mother. I've got something to show you. You framed my first published article? My first online published article, which means you had it printed out? Of course I framed it. That's what you do with a work of art. I can't tell you how much I love reading your stories. Like a special Christmas morning edition, every time. That last one, with that quote from Charles Dickens? "Remembrance, like a candle, "burns brightest at Christmastime." Makes me think of when we first bring the tree inside. You know, suddenly the whole house smells like Christmas. The smile on your mother's face, just grinning with anticipation... Or how the whole kitchen would come alive when she'd bake a batch of her gingerbread cookies. Right. You know, mom used to tell me the most important part of Christmas is to take the time to truly savour it. Because time is our most precious gift of all. Speaking of time, Taylor, how much longer do I have you here with me? Three days, a week at best. They need me back at the paper. I'm actually supposed to be working while I'm here. I have a few leads on a few human interest stories, so... Just like your mom. Always on the clock. I see so much of her in you. I could say the same about you, Grandpa. Your smile, your laugh. The way you'd rather risk a stomach ache than leave a single crumb on your plate. You remind me of her, too. Here's to running in the family! I wonder who that is. Can't be carolers. I think I scared them off last Christmas bringing out my bagpipes. Who was that? I don't know. There's a note here. It says, "From Santa." I miss you, Mom. Merry Christmas. Taylor? Taylor Nichols, right? We met earlier tonight. I was all dressed in red, fluffy white lapels. "Ho-ho-ho"? Well, if it isn't Santa Claus! I'm surprised you can even recognize me without my beard. How could I forget? Meeting the real Santa. I still have your gift. It's a whole lot of candy cane, to be honest. I'm gonna be working on this thing through next New Year's. I've been carrying it for self-defence. Wow. By the way, thanks for the gift basket. Luke: Oh, don't worry about it. You know, my family and I are pretty famous around these parts for them. We like to help Santa out with any last-minute deliveries. I was actually just delivering my last basket right now when I saw you sitting here. You're not waiting for a bus, are you? Because you're gonna be waiting a long time. The next bus doesn't come until tomorrow afternoon. No, I know. I'm not going anywhere. But I'm not really here, either. I see. Uh... Mind if I sit? Please. You know, coming home can be hard. It's like a mirror into your past. Keeping stock, making you remember just who you are. At least, that's what I read on a church billboard on the way over here. I'm Luke, by the way. Luke Malone. I pictured you more as Chris. Or maybe a Nick. I'm not so sure Luke suits you. It's more "outer space" and less "Pere Noel." Okay, well, how about Bob Cratchit? Or Tiny Tim, then? Ah, a Charles Dickens fan, no less. Well, I only know A Christmas Carol. And I didn't even read the book, I just saw the stage play once with my parents. Which reminds me, I... I have some people waiting on me, I should... I should get going. Hey, what's your plan? Can I... Can I give you a ride somewhere? Um... No. I think I'm good to walk, thanks. Okay, well, it was great bumping into you again, Taylor. Nice bumping into you too, Luke. Um, I wanted to thank you. Tonight. It's the two year anniversary of my mother's passing. And ever since then, well, Christmas, it's felt like this... thing that I'm looking at from the outside. Like home is this town that I'm a tourist in. Tonight you helped me find a bit of that magic again. You made it feel a little more like home. So, thanks. Well, I'd like to take credit for that, but that wasn't me. That was Old Saint Nick. Ah. Merry Christmas, Luke Malone! Merry Christmas, Taylor Nichols. And remember, the best gifts don't have bows. Woman: It's Christmas time again, a time for gift-giving and well-wishing. Stocking stuffing and carol singing. A time for all those children out there, dreaming of their toys. A time when, as Dickens wrote, "A thousand odours float in the air, "each one connected with a thousand thoughts "and hopes and joys." So make your lists, and check them twice. Even Santa Claus will tell you, the best gifts don't have bows. So? What do you think? Overall, I think you nailed it. You are really hitting your stride, Taylor. You are fast becoming our go-to voice for everything Christmas. Oh, wow. But the irony is, I'm not all that sure you even enjoy the holidays. No decorations at your desk, no crazy quilted sweater. I don't think I've once seen you belt back a peppermint latte. I suppose I'm more of an inwardly-celebrating holiday goer. Well, whatever the case is, you are mining pure tinsel up there, Taylor. Have a safe trip home. Fingers crossed for your first front page. Front page? Really? If the work stays at this high level, I don't see why not. I'll see you when I get back. And, Barb? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So, excited to head home? Five and a half hours on a crowded passenger bus? I'm thrilled! Well... Maybe you'll get a visit from a certain Santa Claus. I doubt he'd even remember me. Who knows if he's even around this year. Uh, he remembers the names of 6 billion people every Christmas, I'm sure he'll remember yours. Thank you, Bonnie, for the perspective. I'm telling you, Luke, the community spirit is off the charts. Everybody's asking to help at the dinner. Well, whatever you and mom are doing seems to be working. I think your mom is just so happy that you were able to come home again this year. You've been spoiling us. I wish it was every year, believe me. Ah, it's perfect! Ain't it, though? I think that it's our best find yet. Excellent height, colour, branch distribution. Our boy certainly hasn't lost his touch. It's like you've always had this sense, Luke. You can always pick out just the right one. Charlie: A dowsing rod for Douglas Firs. Yes, and you've been telling that story every year since. Well, it's a holiday classic. Now I know some folks prefer Fraser Fir because there's more room for ornaments, but you just can't beat that fresh... Douglas smell. "A thousand odours fill the air, and with them, "connected a thousand thoughts, hopes, and joys." It's Charles Dickens. Since when did you get so literary? I'm expanding my horizons. Uh-huh. I'm reading more. Right... Okay, where do you want the tree? Over there. Have yourself a Merry Christmas! Taylor, you're here. Hi, Grandpa. Oh! Have you grown? You look taller. No, it's just the boots, I swear. So, what ya been up to? I've been reading all your articles. Not much to report since our last phone call. I... I work, eat, sleep, work. You manage to get that editor of yours to finally take notice? As a matter of fact, I think I did. She told me I'm front page ready. Front page ready? Oh! I am so proud of you, Taylor. Your mother, she'd... Well, I think you know how she'd feel. I do. You got that extra apron handy? Coming right up. The sing-along was such a big hit last year, we decided to add a couple of new carols. That's great. And your mother got the whole church choir to sing along with us while we serve dinner. Well, thanks, no doubt, to the example of their hard-working director. I just want it to be nice for everyone. You know, for some of these folks, this is as close as they get to spending Christmas with family. Charlie: These old lights aren't working. Guess we're going to have to get some new ones. I'm sure Frank's is still open. Yeah, I'll just get a couple of boxes of lights. Great. Let me take a look. Are you sure you plugged it in? There you are. Merry Christmas. What can we help you with? Well, I'm just looking for some Christmas lights. Taylor. Luke. Hi. Um... Hi. Luke: These two. That's a lot of lights. Well, it's a lot of tree. So, how will you be paying? Oh, you can charge it, Wynona. It says "Wynona." Oh, yeah. No. It's still Taylor. I promise. I didn't know that you worked here. I... I don't. I do. It's my grandfather's store. I help out when I'm home. Oh, Grandpa Frank, this is... Malone! Luke Malone. Frank. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. Luke's been coming around here since he was about yea high. I didn't know you two were related. You telling me you can't see the resemblance? Well, the mustache does throw it off a little bit, Frank. You dropped off a gift basket at the house last year. That was you? Well, that was... that was Santa, he asked one of his elf friends who works for the city what Taylor Nichols' address was, and that was the address he got. Blaming the elves again, huh? Well, I'm gonna be in the back if you need me. Merry Christmas, Luke. Merry Christmas. So, a little late to be decorating. I'm helping my parents at the community centre, and every year we just try to go a little bit bigger. Oh, for the Veteran's Dinner. Yes. Yeah, we're planning on having enough lights to land a 747 this year. Well, um... There you go. Thanks. It was, um... It was good seeing you. Yeah. You, too. Listen, Taylor, I know you're probably busy tonight, I mean, of all nights, um, but I was wondering... Do you want to do something later? I have to stay and help my grandpa, it's a really busy night, so. Nonsense, dear. I got this. You two go and enjoy your little date. It's not a date. Well, it could be. You want to go? Have fun! Sure. So, have you been keeping up with your Charles Dickens? I heard they're making an animated kids version of Great Expectations. "I will honour Christmas in my heart, "and try to keep it all the year." Wait, have you been reading my old articles? I might have got a bit curious. Down a rabbit hole. Gosh, now I feel so exposed. Don't. It's good. It's really great. Thanks. So, what your next story about? Oh, gosh. I have an interview scheduled. I have to go. Oh, um, well... If you want, I could help you. How handy are you with a camera? I know where to not put my thumbs. That'll do. Come on. These are beautiful, Mrs. Grantham. Oh, honey, call me Annie. Alright, Annie. Hi, Annie. I'm... I'm Luke. A big fan of your work. Oh. Why, thank you. So, when did you start crocheting Christmas ornaments? When my first grand-daughter was born a few years back, I wanted to do something special, you know, for baby's first Christmas. So, I picked up my yarn and my hooks, and just let the inspiration take me. Just like that. Oh, once the rest of the family saw how the first few came out, I started getting requests from my own children and my grandchildren and all their friends, and next thing you knew I was shipping to strangers as far away as Katmandu! And I understand that all of the proceeds go to a local charity? I save some for the phone bills, but it's just me here alone now, so it just kinda made sense. Do you mind if we take some pictures for the article? Oh, you go right ahead. Great. Uh, why don't we get you guys by the Christmas tree? Here. I'll help you up. Oh, thank you. Ready? So, tell me, Luke, how long have you been with the military? What gave me away? Oh, let's just say I recognize the posture. A certain straightening to the spine. I've been around it most of my life. My late husband, he looked great in uniform. Well... Alright, here we go. So, you're in the military? Captain Luke Malone. U.S. Army Infantry. Captain. Wow, I... I had no idea. Well, you know, I don't like to talk about it much when I'm home for the holidays. I spend so little time here, it just reminds me that I'm going to be gone again. I think it's important to stay in the present. So... So, the night we met, I was going on about my own inner crisis and were you about to ship off? I like the fact that you thought that you could talk to me. And I'm glad that I was there to listen. Me, too. A few hours ago, I barely knew your name. So, why does it feel like now you're some sort of long lost... Don't say relative. Don't say relative. Fellow traveler? A fellow traveler? Fellow traveler. Well, um, fellow traveler, seeing how we are out all this way, can I show you something? Sure. Taylor: Beautiful. Luke: Yeah. Listen, I just wanna say that I know that this time of year isn't easy for you, but I think you have this... This perfect way of capturing it all. Do I? I guess I'm good at faking it then. Come on. Nobody's that good at faking it. Well, I mean, I can see it, and hear it, and smell that Christmas spirit all around me, I just... I don't know, I can't seem to feel it anymore. It's like my heart's been walled-off. Lower your window. What? Just roll down your window. Okay. Close your eyes. Close my... Close your eyes. Okay. What do you hear? I don't hear anything. I just hear the snow on the truck. Exactly. You know, whenever I feel the world is just too big or too noisy, I like to come up here. Just leave it all behind, and just... just listen to that silent snowfall. I think that if you can learn to appreciate that stillness... you'll find that your heart's not as... as walled-off as you think it is. There's a poetry to you, Luke Malone. Well, I think that's just you rubbing off on me. Maybe a little. Dad. Luke! You got those lights? What on earth took you so long? I was about to send out a search party. Well, hello there, I'm Charlie Malone, Luke's father. Taylor Nichols. Wonderful to meet you. Taylor, Taylor. I remember Frank Tabor at the hardware store once mentioned that he had a grand-daughter by the name of Taylor. Wow, Dad, you... you really know everyone in this town. What can I say? I was a captive audience. I must have spent 15 minutes hearing all about his genius granddaughter while I was there buying a screwdriver! Yeah, that's my Grandpa. Mom, um, this is Taylor. Taylor, this is my mom Peggy. Hi, nice to meet you. Oh, you too, Taylor. You have your hands full, Peggy, how can I help you? Well, if you could take the bag of lights there, um, and follow me, and we'll put you to work. Hey, Luke. She, um, she seems nice. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something about her, I just... I can't put it into words. Um... This arrived while you were gone. Oh, uh... Thanks. She's quite lovely. I am so happy for you. Yeah, well, don't get too excited, Mom. We haven't even had our first date yet. Oh, your father told me about the letter. What did it say? I'm in charge of winter mountain training. Yeah, I'll be training troops from over half a dozen countries. It's in Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe! Luke, I am so proud of you. Yeah. So, what do you think? This one looks good? But I'm gathering you wish the timing was a little better. Well, how do you say, "Hey, Taylor, I know we don't know each other that well, but I think we're meant to be together, oh, by the way, we just need to wait a whole year to find out." Just like that, son. And if the feeling is mutual, you'll have to let her decide on her own. Whatever the future might hold for the two of you, Taylor should know what it means to be with a soldier. Oh, and it looks like they're about to light the tree! You guys ready? Oh, yes, please. Alright. Well, on second thought, Taylor, why don't you do the honours this year? Okay. One, two... Three. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, honey. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Hey. Everything okay? You wanna take a walk with me? Sure. Taylor: Are you okay? Luke: Yeah. When I was a kid, I was frustrated about my dad leaving, I'd... I'd come up here. Seems like a good spot to think. Mostly I just yelled, actually. Yeah, I've been known to do that, too. But back in the city I usually have to resort to the fire escape. Taylor, I... I might be reading into this assuming that you would even care, but... I'm shipping out again. Just after Christmas. I got my notice today. Oh. Where are you going? Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe? Wow, that's great! Yeah, no. No, it is great. I'm helping train a squadron of multinational recruits. It's pretty remote. How remote? Well, let's put it this way, if you have a letter you'd like to get to the real Santa Claus, I'd be happy to pass it along. Got it. So, how long will you be gone? A year. When do you leave? In a week. A week. That's soon. Yeah, I know, I know. I wish... I wish we had more time to spend together. But you'll still be back for visits though, right? Weekend furloughs? That sort of thing? It's doubtful. We're helicoptered in. Satellite communications. It's survival training. So much for fellow travelers. Listen, I put in for this a while back, before... you and I... I like you, Taylor. And listen, I know this might sound crazy, but just talking to you, it just feels... Right? Yeah. It feels right. I know. Is this kind of how it's gonna be for us? We just say goodbye only to bump into each other at some random destination somewhere? Maybe this time we don't say goodbye. Maybe... Maybe we try to make it work. We try to keep it going. Write and email. They have phones out there, right? A pretty good satellite system from what I'm told, weather depending. I don't know, maybe we make the distance work. Whatever it takes, right? That's what the army's slogan is. Close, yeah. I like you, too, Luke Malone. You know, my mom, she used to tell me the most important part of Christmas is taking the time to truly savour it. Because time is our most precious gift of all. You know that. And what would your mom say if she knew that we only had a week together? She'd say... "Enjoy it while it lasts." Taylor As another Christmas approaches, it's time once again to pause for a moment in our day-to-day lives, look forward to the year ahead, and reflect on the one we've left behind. It's a time to remember all the people we love, the people we loved, the people above, the familiar faces missing from our table, and the welcomed guests who just weren't able. Hi! I think fondly of my friend, Annie Grantham, busy knitting ornaments, her heart out there to show. And my good friends, Peg and Charlie, arranging gift baskets to go. Sorry, to be continued. Hi! Oh, hey, Luke. How's it going? I think of all the moms we miss, the doting fathers we can't kiss, the siblings we can't hug hello, and the soldiers who aren't coming home. So, when you make your Christmas list this year, remember all those people who you never got to thank. When you make your Christmas list this year, remember to leave one side blank. So, thoughts? I think it's a little sad, but I mean, that's the thing about the holidays, you're enjoying what's there, but you're also... You're also aware of what's missing. It's not too sentimental? Oh, if anything I thought it was a little moving. Well, I didn't see you cry. In front of these guys? Come on, it would be the end of me. He's lying to you, Taylor! He cried when he read your piece out loud. Oh, you read it out loud? To the whole squad. Twice. Twice, okay. Well, thank you, Adam, for your honesty. I appreciate it. He misses you, Taylor! You're all he talks about besides Monday night football! Okay, bye! So. About the promotion. I have my meeting with Barb first thing this morning. Fingers crossed. Sweetie, you've got nothing to be nervous about. You worked hard for this. It's almost lights-out here, so you let me know just as soon as you can, okay? Taylor, um... Taylor? Luke? Can you hear me? Tay... It's... It's okay, it's just a storm front moving through. It's nothing to worry about. Luke, I... I think you're breaking up. Taylor, I love you. I love you... too. Barb: Oh, this is great. Thank you. Excellent. Oh. You wanted to see me, Barb? Yeah. Come in, Taylor. First I want you to know that I could not be happier with the work you've done here over the past two years. Thank you. But I also sense that you may feel a bit stalled in your career? Stalled? No. No, I love working here. And I love having you here, which is why I am offering you the position of Associate Editor for our Features Department. Editor? Associate Editor. You'd help find and assign stories, get first reads of copy, keep a close eye on the budget, as well as continuing to write your own stories. Barb, I... In other words, a lot more work for not a lot more money. Interested? Yes. Yes! Good! Now... have a merry little Christmas, and be ready in the new year to hit the ground running. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Here you go. So? What's the big news? Well, you are looking at the next editor. Editor?! Well, associate editor, but... Congratulations! That is fantastic. What did Luke say? Uh... Yeah, I messaged him. It takes a while to go through, so... I'm sure he'll be jubilant. Luke's still coming home for the holidays? After one whole year apart. Wow, you must be so excited. And a little nervous. Why? You guys seem perfect. Everything feels perfect, I can talk to him about anything. My hopes, my fears. Somehow, even from thousands of miles away, he makes me feel so safe. Like a warm, cozy blanket. Like a warm, ruggedly handsome, tough as nails, cozy blanket? Yes, all of that. I love him. And he loves me, and... It's magic. It feels like we're living a dream. But what if that's all it is? We've spent 99 percent of our relationship long distance. We've managed to make it fun, but this thing is no substitute for... Physicality. Okay, well, that is an issue of proximity. But I was going to say... it's no substitute for the real thing. Don't second-guess it. Hey. I know, without any doubt, that my best friend is in love with an awesome guy. It's written all over your face. I am. I am madly in love with him. Bad news, brother. What's the matter? There's a heavy storm front moving in. They've grounded all flights out. We're lucky we still have comms for now. Until it clears, none of us are going anywhere. Well, there was supposed to be enough time. What is this? A bad joke? I wish I was joking. Base says it's not safe to fly out. Adam, I need to get home. Okay? I made plans to... Sorry, brother. I know how much you were looking forward to going home, but it ain't happening. Merry Christmas, John, and thanks again for stopping by. This is a really great thing you're doing here. Ah, we're just doing what we can. Excuse me, ma'am. Is Captain Malone here? No, sorry he's not. We're actually not sure if he's coming home right now. There's a bad storm and no flights are getting out, so. Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that. Yeah. Can I pass anything on when I speak to him? I just wanted to thank him. Thank him? Captain Malone, he's been helping me out with a few things, getting me back on my feet. He helped me find my last job, but the contract just finished, so I was going to see if he had anything else. You know, I might have an idea. It doesn't pay all that well, but it could be a good fit. Really? Thanks! And thanks for doing all this. It matters. Of course. And any friend of Luke's is a friend of mine. Merry Christmas. I wondered where you got to. I was just checking. Ah, still no word? No. You know, it's really wonderful what you do here for so many people. After I lost my mom, I didn't understand any of this. You know, I could talk about it, I could even write about it, but Christmas, that was for everyone else. No matter how hard I tried, I didn't know how to celebrate. And now that I'm beginning to understand... the one person who showed me what all of this means, and what I've been missing, he's the one person I can't be with at Christmas, and I don't know what to do. Oh, Taylor. You will find your way. I know you will. Come here, come here. Luke? Is everything alright? It's perfect. Hey, Dad, I'm just calling because I need your help with something. Alright, son, name it. I need you to go in my old room and get something out of the dresser. Okay. Okay, and I need one more favour tonight. I'm all ears. Here's the plan. Taylor, honey, you've done enough work for tonight. Come, join us at the fireplace. Luke? Taylor? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I can hear you, Luke! Merry Christmas! Luke: Merry Christmas. Listen, I'm sorry I can't be there. It's... Well, it's looking more certain I'm not going to make it home at all this year. Still, I, uh... I wanted to get you something. Are you going to get your whole squad to sing me "Silent Night" again? Well, nothing that extravagant. Just a simple question. Look, I really wanted to do this in person, but... I guess this is just going to have to do. Taylor... from the first moment that I met you, all I wanted was a life beside you. Will you do me the honour of becoming my wife? Will you marry me? Luke called me about a month ago to ask for my blessing, and I said yes. Grandpa. Yes, Luke, I'll marry you! Yes? You said yes? I said yes. Luke, I'll marry you. She said yes! Taylor? Luke, Luke! Taylor, you're breaking up. The communications... Taylor? It's okay. Yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. I'm so happy. Congratulations. Thank you. Thanks, Grandpa. What's going on? Can we get them back? Comms seem to be down all over base. It could be an issue with the satellite. Alright, I'm gonna go check for myself. You're not thinking of going out there alone, are you? I know the terrain better than anyone. And what's your experience with repairing advanced radio communications systems? It's passable. I'm coming with you. Arm yourself, we'll be close to enemy territory. Adam: How are the wedding plans coming along? Funny. Well, you've been engaged all of 30 minutes. I figured you already have it all planned out. Honestly, I'm just running with my own intuition on this one, brother. You know it's not going to be the same in these snowy mountains without you. Oh, come on, you know I'm going to miss the freezing nights, the no internet, those MREs. Good times! You'll be having a good time. Training those newbies on Christmas while I'm at home, warm and cozy with my bride. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. I'm just sorry I can't be there. I'd better be there. I've known you a long time, Luke. I've seen you walk into situations that would have an average man buckle, but I've never seen you so sure about anything than you are about Taylor. I'd trust in your intuition. There it is. I gotta perform a reset. You hear that? I definitely heard something. Probably one of Santa's reindeer. Come on. Let's head back. Come on, you're not getting cold feet already, are you? Everything's cold. I know it doesn't help right now, but this isn't the first time I've ever lost touch with one of my guys. I once didn't hear from Charlie for over a week. Wow. That must've been awful. Longest week of my life. Sometimes I feel like I miss Luke, even when we do talk. He can get so quiet. He doesn't want to talk about what he's doing or how he's doing. No, he wants to talk about the Christmas Festival, or what's happening at the store. Or which carols the choir is gonna sing for Christmas dinner. All the little things. Yeah. When a soldier's away from the ones they love, they miss home more than anyone can imagine. So, hearing about those little things, those things that don't seem important to us, that's something they can hang on to. Especially at Christmas. So, hearing about the lights and the music, he feels a little less alone. Exactly. Frank: Well, I'll be. Look who's back! Oh! Can you guys hear me? We hear you loud and clear, Luke! Taylor? I'm here, Luke. Listen, I'm so sorry about all the communication problems, but I think we got it sorted out. Now, looks like we have a wedding to plan! That we do. Yes. Taylor, you're still here? I thought you already turned in your last story before the big day. I'm working on something else, actually. Luke and I decided to write our own vows, and let's just say the words aren't exactly flowing. Maybe I can help. What do you have so far? "Dear Luke." That's it? Uh-huh. Do wedding vows typically start with "dear?" It kinda sounds like you're breaking up. I've managed to write two words and one of them is so wrong. Well, don't overthink it too much, Taylor. Share what's in your heart that day. Now I'm off to Honolulu! Make sure you lock up, and remember to have some fun! Merry Christmas. Yeah, I'm just about ready. Bonnie's helping me pack. Hey, Luke! Hi, Bonnie. She's gonna be my maid of honor, did I mention that? I mentioned that. How about you? Everything okay? Yeah, no, it looks like Adam's pretty sure he's gonna be able to make it as my best man, and the weather's looking perfect for flying. So, I'll see you soon. I just can't wait to see you. That sounds so lame. It just doesn't convey the gravity of an entire year apart. Well, only a few more days now. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye. So? You all set? We have a wedding to finalize! Let's do this. Bonnie: Let's do this! Taylor: This is the shop here. It's cute, right? Bonnie: It's so cute. Oh, my gosh! Grandpa, we're here! Nathan: Oh. Oh, Nathan! Hi. Hey! It's so good to see you! Nathan, this is my friend, Bonnie. Bonnie, Nathan. Nice to meet you, Nathan. Merry Christmas! You, too. Merry Christmas. Taylor! You two are finally here! Hi, Grandpa. Grandpa, this is my friend Bonnie. Great to meet you, Bonnie. So glad you could be here. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't miss this for the world. I adore Christmas weddings! They're like a soap opera in a snow globe! Speaking of snow globes. Do you sell any here? I promised my mom I'd bring back a souvenir. Nathan, would you mind? Yeah, right over here. Oh, amazing. So, how are things working out with Nathan? Oh, it's working great. I had no idea how much I needed the help around here. We could all use a little help every now and then. Sometimes we're lucky enough to be in the position to give some. How are the wedding preparations coming along? We're getting there, inch by inch. I don't know what I would do without Bonnie's help, and Peg and Charlie, and you. Speaking of that, I am late for my dress fitting. Bonnie? Okay. I found the perfect one. It's beautiful, and it's a wedding cake. Ah! Just wait one more minute. You'll ruin your appetite. Impossible. Ah, you. Are you ready? Mm-hmm. Taylor: Okay, guys. I think I'm ready. Let me know if I've got this hemline right. Oh... So? What do you think? I think it might be bunching a little bit at the back. You look... Beautiful. Like an angel. Oh, Charlie, are you crying? Uh, it's just that mistletoe allergy of mine. Bonnie: It's perfect. Perfect. Okay. Now that we've finalized the guest list, I'll e-mail that to the caterer. And the photographer said she finally found someone to assist with the video. Do you think two cameras is enough? I was thinking, what about a drone? A couple of nice aerial shots. You know, I saw in this magazine they had this crazy high shot. Two cameras are plenty, Ms. Spielberg. Okay. Florist has the order for the bouquet. Mm-hmm. Poinsettias for the table settings. You don't think they're too, I don't know, traditional? No. It's a Christmas wedding. Poinsettias are mandatory. Well, then the decision is made. Chapel, music, minister, final dress fitting. Oh, and I can't make any promises, but right now, the weather forecast is calling for light snow. Hopefully just as we're coming out after the ceremony, for that cinematic effect. We're in the home stretch, Taylor. Everything else is in the details. I know. All we're missing now is the groom. I'm so sorry. That totally came out wrong. Bonnie, it's okay. I know he'll be here. This time, luck will be on our side. I can feel it. Thank you so much, Peggy, for all your help. I really appreciate it. You're family. Of course. Luke? Hi, Taylor. You're... you're here. You're early. Yeah. I thought I'd surprise you with some good news for a change. Charlie: So, there we were at the tree farm, all set to pick out the perfect Christmas tree. Yes. And this little guy, he's only three years old. It's his first time. But he keeps on saying, "Not this one. Not that one." None of them were right. Okay, Mom. I don't think anybody wants to hear this story. You don't want to hear this story, right? I think I do. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hear, hear! So, we were walking around... And keep in mind, this place goes on forever and it was snowing like the dickens. And you know what? The daylight was running dry. And so finally, Charlie says to Luke, "Buddy, we're going to freeze here. Give us a hint. What exactly are we looking for?" What did he say? Well, he said the trees all looked too plain. He was looking for one with decorations, like in the pictures. Aww. And ever since that day, we've always let Luke pick out the perfect Christmas tree. You still want to marry me? Definitely. Aw. Okay. That calls for a cheers. Ah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. So, home two whole days early. Well, that was Adam's idea, actually, not to tell you. He thought that you would enjoy the... Oh, the shock? Yeah. Actually, "surprise" was the word he used. Okay. And how long has Adam been married or had a steady girlfriend? You know, now that you mention it, he is a perpetual bachelor. Hmm. Shocking. Oh. I, uh... Sorry, Taylor. I just have to take this. It's a call from command at base. Is everything okay? Yeah. No worries. Man on phone: Captain, it's Colonel Murphy. My apologies for the intrusion. Luke: That's all right, sir. As you know, Captain Kerney has been in charge of the training mission in your stead. Yes, sir. Wait. Is everything okay? Kerney's team was on a training run when their helicopter reported engine trouble. They've been out of contact ever since. Uh, how long ago was this? Yesterday morning. Until we're sure, we have to assume their helicopter went down. Taylor, is something wrong? Luke just got a call from base. Oh. Well, you know, sir, communications are tricky up there. Maybe they're just not getting through. We've already got a search and rescue mission in the air. Sir, you're not going to see anything from up there. Not in that terrain. And there's nowhere to land, either. You're going to have to get a team in there, sir. A team that knows that area. Unfortunately, there's a blizzard coming in, and that window is closing. Luke, I know you're home right now, with your bride, preparing for your wedding. I won't order you to do this, but I know you're close with Captain Kerney and you'd want to be kept informed. I understand. Thank you, sir. Is everything okay, son? That was Colonel Murphy. What did he have to say? Uh, Adam and his team, they were on a training mission, and, um, the helicopter reported trouble and they've lost communication. There's a blizzard coming in, and it's going to cut them off and force them to make their way down the mountain on foot. Taylor, we need to talk. Can they really do this? Can they order you to go like this? It wasn't an order, Taylor. It was my decision to make. The car is going to be here in 30 minutes. Um... My dad gave 25 years of his life to the military before he retired. Did I ever tell you that? No. He was away a lot. Yeah. He missed, uh, graduations, countless birthdays, Christmas. I remember this one Christmas. My mom was... She was talking to my dad, and she put me on with him. And I... You know, I was so angry I barely said two words. But I remember hearing something in his voice that made me realize that... It was harder for him to be away for Christmas than it was for me. It wasn't his choice to go. He... He had to go. Because he's a soldier. Because it's his duty. Taylor, you know, we've lost so much time already. I... Luke. You have to do this. You won't make it back in time for the wedding, will you? No. So then, we wait. We wait just a little while longer. I mean, if there's one thing this past year has taught me, it's that some things are worth the wait. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you. And you will. As soon as you come back. I love you, Luke. I love you. Which is why I could never ask you not to go. Dance with me. What? Dance with me. Just here.

You'll go on foot from there. You sure about this, soldier? No one here would blame you for getting right back on that plane. Adam would do the same for me, sir. We'll find them, Colonel. You do that, Captain. Then let's get you home to your bride. Chopper is standing by. Thank you. Could you pass me one of those smelling salts, please? Absolutely, Frank. Thank you kindly, sir. There we go. Everything's going to be just fine. We'll be first to hear. I know. You know, I'll be right back. I've notified the caterer, the florist, the makeup artist and the chapel rental. The good news is Pastor Mandel is a veteran. So, and I quote, "Whatever it takes." I'm still not exactly sure what to tell the guests. Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie. I can't imagine what you're going through, and here I am going on about flower arrangements. Bonnie, it's okay. I really appreciate everything you're doing. Everyone's been so good. Has there been any news at all? No. Not since yesterday. "The best gifts don't have bows." Is that another Charles Dickens quote? Like "Bah, humbug"? No, it's something Luke said to me, the night we first met. If I'm going to have to accept all of this uncertainty... then I'm going to have to do it on my own terms. I'm done waiting and wishing and wondering. Maybe sometimes, we have to make our own Christmas wishes come true. Taylor, are you okay, dear? Charlie: I know it seems like worry is all we got right now, but I know Luke, and I know the army. We just have to have faith. You're right, Charlie. And I know you and Peggy have been in this same spot many times before, and you always made it through. But after I lost my mother, I made up my mind to take charge of my own life. I had you to help me, Grandpa Frank, but I made my own decisions. And I found my own way to be the person that I wanted to be. And now, now, I... Now, everyone is asking you to wait, to be patient, and it just doesn't feel like enough. Luke showed me what it means to love Christmas again. But all of these lights and decorations, they just remind me that he's thousands of miles away, that it's dangerous, and he could get hurt. So, I can't just sit here anymore, hoping. I need to do something. I need to do something to make things better. If there's anything that we can do, Taylor, you got it. Charlie, I need you to make a call for me. You made it. I have to say, when you called, I thought you were crazy. But now, seeing you both here, well, I still think this is crazy. It seems like yesterday. Been too long. Taylor, this is Colonel Clay Murphy. Clay, this is Taylor Nichols, Luke's fiancé. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. And thank you so much for making this happen. Ah, the pleasure is all mine. Charlie called asking for a Christmas miracle, and I was happy I could deliver. Captain Malone is one of a kind in my book. Well, I think so, too. Let's get you inside. Charlie: So, what's the latest? Well, there was a break in the storm long enough to drop the captain's unit here, where they went on foot and made contact with the downed chopper crew, here. When we last received word, they'd regrouped with their chopper and were making their way back. We've been told to prepare for injuries. Um, do you think they'll make it back tonight? Hard to say. It's a wild one out there. For now, they're on their own. It's not unheard of in missions like this, Taylor, to lose contact. I'm sure that everything is going to be just fine. We just have to wait it out. You okay, Taylor? So, this is it. This is all he has of home. Charlie: That's right. It's you. You're his home. Man: Near the entrance. Man: Warm. Woman: Try to get it warmed up. Woman: First aid kit. Woman: Open up. Clear in the back. Luke? Is Luke here? Taylor? What are you doing here? Are you okay? Is everybody okay? I'm fine. Yeah. Everyone's fine. What are you doing here? I couldn't wait any longer, so I made our Christmas wish come true. I brought Christmas to you. Luke Taylor, when you first met me, I was wearing a red suit with a big, long, white beard. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It's no secret to anyone here just how much I love Christmas. You look good, brother. Thanks. Luke But I didn't understand what it truly meant until I fell in love with you. It means that wherever we are, we'll always be together. Connected. Feeling the joy and happiness that we feel on this day. Taylor Luke, I remember the night we first met, too. Here we go. Here we go. Taylor Your bright eyes, your warm laugh. And I wondered how anyone could be so jolly wearing that scratchy beard. But most of all, I remember the way you made me feel when you said you hoped my Christmas wish comes true. You gave me hope on a night that I was feeling lost and afraid to move on. And now, thanks to you, I have only one wish on my Christmas list... and that's to spend every Christmas with you for the rest of our lives. Taylor, with this ring, I promise to love you and care for you, and spend the rest of my life making sure that all of your Christmas wishes, they all come true. Taylor: Luke, with this ring, I promise to share with you whatever lies ahead. Laughter, tears, troubles, and joys. But above all, a love that will last forever. Merry Christmas.
