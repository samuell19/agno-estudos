So it's the last day of the Bonzer Rally here in the Land Down Under. And Archie Vainglorious is still the driver to beat. Oh, come on. It looks like Team Hot Spots race has just been cut short. What did I tell you, folks? Nobody's been able to get close to Vainglorious since the amazing Gnash mysteriously stopped racing. Thank you. So that's one more rally cap for Archie Vainglorious. Legend, champ. One day, I'm going to be the champ. Rebel. Yeah! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Once again, it's time for the annual Slow Loris Day Festival here in the-- Yeah! Coming through! We have a new champion! The crowd is going wild! The crown is on its-- oh. Weirdo. How shameful for your granny. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen. Really? Totally. I really like your helmet. Thanks. I painted it myself. It's a soup pot. I know. By the way, I'm Zhi. Hi, I'm-- Zhi-zhi. Uh-oh, hide me, please. How many times do I have to tell you? You need to stop with your foolish racing fantasies. Granny Bai, Granny Bai. Uhm, nice meeting you. I swear he's just a stubborn as you were. Look at it, my best soup pot. I don't get it, mama. Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo when I'm just being me. And Granny, she doesn't get me at all. She just makes me practice Tai Chi. Tai Chi is how we learn to slow down the world by allowing the breath of life to flow through us. Whoa. And she makes me trim plants. The tree just knows how to grow, the leaves to bloom. This is their. The question you must answer is, what is your?? But I don't care about that kind of stuff, mama. I just want to race. Mama, mama! I got a slot in tonight's race. And I know I can win this one. Oh, hey, don't tell Granny, OK? Who's racing? I'm racing. Who's racing? I'm racing. Who's racing? This guy. I am racing. Whoa! And it looks like it's going to be a drag race into the final stretch with Local Loris VE on the move. He finds his pocket. And he takes the lead. This is it. I got this. I totally got this. Oh! Ooh, and with no one to blame but himself, that has got to sting. Hey, kid. Why the cloudy face? Oh, hey, Gnash. I saw you out there tonight. You looked pretty good. I think you might need to get your glasses fixed. I learned long ago to trust my gut, not my eyes. Ooh. Pretty good, right? OK, how about this one? Winners are always winning even when they're losing. Hmm, I-- I got to go. Do we have to do this? Yes, your is blocked again. Hey, check it out. Tai Chi with a beetle-- Tai Chitle. Wow. Tai Chitle is not a thing. Off you go. I'm begging your pardon, Granny Bai. I'm worried about you. When will you find your?? How do you know I haven't? Because is the path to harmony. And this, this is not harmonious. What if that's because I have a different path? And this is it. It's just a loop-- a never-ending loop of humiliation and rejection. What if this is my harmony? It's not. Whoa! What is going on? What the-- That's it. That's it. Down it goes. Vainglorious Industries? Like Archie Vainglorious? Congratulations. Your lovely home has been hand-selected by me, Archie Vainglorious, for temporary repossession and extreme demolition. Demolition? Yes, demolition. Echo, diabolical laugh. Have a nice day. How can they do this? No. Don't cry, Granny. This has to be some kind of misunderstanding. I'm going to go and try to sort this out somehow. Whoa! And Archie Vainglorious has just taken the Bonzer Rally Cup. What the? Whoa, that's a big toad. Huh? Right, who are you? And who let you in? Oh, hi. My name's Zhi. But usually, people call me Zhi. I'm a-- I'm a huge fan. Of course, you are. Congratulations, you met me, Archie Vainglorious. OK. Thanks, but I actually came for something else. I'm from the Slow Loris Village. And I want to talk about my Granny's house. I think there's been a misunderstanding. I mean, what would a cane toad and a legendary racer like you even want with the Slow Loris Village? Nothing. That's why I'm going to plant and flood it. Let me show you. Muddy Meadows-- luxury, high-end swamplands for the posh toad set. Muddy Meadows? To test it better than Funky Fields. But it's the last Slow Loris Village in China. How can you even be allowed to do this? Quite easily, actually, because who really knows what a Slow Loris is? Hey, now, if you were pandas, forget about it. But slow lorises? Please, who even cares? I do! OK, OK, no need to get your nickels in a twist. You and your Granny still have 10 days to pay. 10 days? We can't raise this much money in 10 days. Well, in that case-- Huh? Hold on. Hold on. Hey, hey, wait. Oh, coming soon. Ah The Silk Road Rally, Kashgar to Shanghai. Oh, it's going to be epic. It's a little presumptuous, isn't it? Building a trophy case? I mean, you haven't even won yet. But I will. Let me break it down for you, fellow. Daddy, grandaddy, my imbecile brothers helped me join in on the business. Help us bump the numbers. Real estate is boring. It's really quite a blunder. So they bring the coins while I bring the thunder. The fastest car, I got it. Your village, I bought it. It makes my daddy proud to have our name and all on it. Rally after rally, knocking trophies down like pins. Plain and simple, loris, Vainglorious wins. The album drops next year. You seem pretty confident you're going to win. Willing to stake a bet on it? What do you have in mind? If I win the cup-- Wait! You? You are the one who is personally going to be doing the beating of me? I laugh at the idea. I know it's crazy. Sorry, little champ. You were saying? If I win, you give me the deed to Granny's house free and clear. Such hutzpah, I love it! I accept your bet. But if I win, you become the face of Muddy Meadows. Me? But I'm not a toad. No, but you are toad-ally adorable. See you at the starting line, slow loris. Slow loris. Super nice guy. I look forward to annihilating him. Why the long face, kid? I kind of have to sort of race the Silk Road Rally and win it. The Silk Road Rally? Oh, that the race is no holds barred. 200 miles per hour for four days straight across unforgiving terrain against the craziest drivers in the world. Yeah, so why would you want to get mixed up in the kamikaze mission like that? Because it's the only shot I've got as saving our house from becoming Muddy Meadows. I don't follow. If I don't win that cup, Vainglorious Industry is going to tear down our house. Vainglorious? As in Archie Vainglorious? I know! How am I going to beat the best racer in the world? I'm in way over my head, Gnash. Our home is all we have. It's my mom's final resting place. Hmm. All right, kid, come with me. Whoa! This place is awesome. You were a race car driver? I've been lots of things. So this is how I see it, kid. You are like this part. You got everything you need, but it's just a tangled up mess. It can't do you any good. But you and me together, looking good. Nice, looking real good. Together, there ain't nothing we can't do. Together like me and you? Yeah, I've probably seen every one of your crisis-- I mean, races. You have? You've got raw talent. And you've got guts, but you're missing something. I can help you find it. But only if you're willing to listen. No questions asked. You would do that? But why? OK, that was two questions right off the line there. What part of no questions asked did you not understand? Hey, the heart of a champion beats in all of us, kid. See you tomorrow. That apple really didn't fall far from the tree, did it? I know. I know. I said I was walking away for good, but he's your son. What am I supposed to do? Birds got to fly. Fishes got to swim. And the goat-- well, a goat has got to race. So Zhi-zhi, how did it go with Vainglorious? Yeah, good. Very good. Yeah, I have it under control. Just leave it-- leave it at me. I just have to go away for a while. Go away? Where? To How to Defeat an Evil Cane Toad TedTalk? I got to go. See you later, Granny. You do know that when he lies to me, his left eye twitches. Exactly the same way yours did. OK, kid. Let's talk about your last race. It was yours to win, but then-- Ugh. So what happened? Do you see that guy's car? If I had a car like that-- What the? Cars don't win races. Drivers do. Although, yeah, we actually are going to need a car. What? Appearance is an illusion. It's what's inside that counts. Reluctantly crouched at the starting line. Engines pumping and thumping in time. The green light flashes. The flames go up. Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup. They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank. Fuel burning fast on an empty tank. Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns. Their prowess is potent and secretly stern. As they speed through the finish, the flags go down. The fans get up. And they get out of town. The sun has gone down. And the moon has gone up. A long ago, somebody left with the cup. But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns and thinking of someone-- OK, let's see what you got. He's going the distance. He's going for speed. She's all alone. All alone. It's just like in his last race. The moment he takes the lead, he chokes. The key to winning is focusing on the road ahead of you. Also, not crashing into walls is good. He always gets nervous when he's ahead. Oh, oh, oh. Whoa! Maybe if I hold him back-- that's it! Not yet. Not yet. Now. That was awesome! Go, Gnash. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. Pathetic. Moronic. Beyond ridiculous. Oh, this is too easy. Seahorses? Seriously? Hold the line. Who's this? The Amazing Gnash? Right. Well, you're not nearly as dead as I thought you were. Hmm, this is quite the wrinkle. If you're in the race, I could lose. It's V. What do you want? I'm ready for you to repay me that favor. Neil will be in touch with further instructions. Welcome race fans to the Silk Road Rally. I am Abby Jacks. And with me, at the repeated request of my husband, is my sister-in-law, Juni Hakansdotter. Hey, that's me. And hailing from India, India's team, Tandem. I wonder how they put their pants on. And there they are, the British Invasion. And straight out of South Central, China, Bling and Bling. Good morning race fans and welcome to the main event. Ha-ha! Who let the frog out? I got him. Who let the frog out? Who let the frog out? And, of course, no race would be complete without an entry from Britain's notorious, Team Vainglorious. Oh, he looks slimy. Come on, kid. Let's get out of here. Hey. I'm just so excited. By Vainglorious? No, by this. I'm due in less than two weeks. Wait. What? I'm pregnant. Oh, man, we are such a miracles, eh? Oh, I'm Berpe, Team Wet Lightning. Oh, hi, nice to meet you. I'm Zhi. Berpe, would you get your sweet little tail over here? Race is about to start. That's my Adalina. , good luck out there. Long before the internet connected the world, there was the legendary Silk Road. A road that's made of silk? I can't believe this. No, it's not made of-- forget it. The course is a 4,000 clickhorse straight across China. The race will take place in four legs over four days. And the race with the shortest overall time takes the cup. Other than that, there are no rules. And as the race is wide at the line, they're all thinking the same thing. Did I remember to put on my fireproof underpants? No, just for one brief moment, it's still anyone's cup. Remember Vainglorious drives dirty. And he doesn't waste any time. Trust me. Are you ready, Zhi? Ready? All right, fellas. Let's go. Vainglorious wastes no time trying to clear the field. Look out! Ah! You weren't kidding. That toad is crazy. You said you wanted to race the Silk Road Rally. Welcome to it. And the races begin to make their way across the Taklamakan Desert. You're supposed to be out of the race. Supposed to be. Ah! Get it off! Get it off! Ah, new idea. Echoes, attack. And here comes Argentina's Team Kale driving a car with no steering wheel at all. Ah! Holy molly, newbie team Muddy Meadows just took the lead from Vainglorious. Enjoy the moment, loris. It will not last. Diabolical laugh. Oh, yeah! I can't get him off my tail. All right, kid. It's all about focus now. Enter the zone. No distraction. OK, I get it. Hey, is that a loris? I'm pretty sure it's a loris right there. Gee, focus. Whoa! Whoa! You're right. That is a loris. We should stop. What? I was to say we just-- stop! Total loser! Unbelievable! The lead car just chucked to U-ey. What are you doing? No questions asked. You agreed. Gnash! Oh, come on, Gnash. Get back here. Hmm? What-- Hey, Neil. It's been a long time. Well, if it isn't the Average Gnash. Seriously? 15 years, that's the best you could come up with? Hey, you OK over here? Yeah, I'm fine. Whoa! Wow, this is heavier than it looks. Whoa, you're a loris. Uh. So you got a name or-- Uh. What if I just call you Speedy? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh, uh-huh. A racer and a great conversationalist-- my lucky day. Gnash, you all right? Never better. Hey, you dropped this. Huh? Well, that was fun. I don't think that tiger is going to give you any more grief. You'd be surprised. Thanks for stopping guys. And maybe I'll see you around sometimes, Speedy. Uh. Aw. Sorry to break up the fun, kids. Gnash, don't-- But we have to get back to our race. Bye. Nice meeting you. Penny for your thoughts, Speedy? Huh? Oh, it's nothing. All good. Oh, there you are, Shelby. I'm dying to hear. Give me the deets. Why didn't you tell me that your mark was a loris? What a scintillating question. Let me have a think on that. I don't know. Maybe because you work me. So what happened? Let's just say your pet kitty is going to have quite the headache when he wakes up. Sorry, I don't follow. Your tiger couldn't handle the goat. Vainglorious will be the first to throw his name up on the leaderboard. But with three more days of racing ahead, this race is far from over. Wait, so this race is actually four days. You cost us the race. Races aren't won or lost until the final second. We were ahead. Why would you make a stop? Feel with your gut, not with your eyes. That's not what I sound like. Let's do a whole training montage. But then, let's make it totally irrelevant by stopping and blowing our time. I don't know where this kid has come from, but he's clearly come to win. Oh, I know this one. He came from China. Oh my. Sixth place-- super impressive-- on opposite. Sixth place? You did great, kid. I was in the lead. Which is when you always lose it. But when you're behind, kid, you're a force of nature. Zhi, how could you not have told me that you are such a driver? Fantastico! Fantastico? Anyone else would have come in last after stopping like you did today. But then, oh, watching you drive, it's like a poetry in motion. I need a snack. I don't know, maybe a pint of ice cream and some seaweed pad thai. I know why he's doing it, but I'm still terrified every time he walks out of that gate. Watch over him up there, OK? For both of us. Who could that be at this hour? Oh my dears, come in, come in. Oh, thank you. What the? That was seriously me? How did I-- Not a big fan of parties, huh? Who said that? Hey! You, wait up. Hey, where did you go? Oh, hey. Hey, hi. It's-- it's you. Oh, I see you've been working on your conversation skills. Ha! my conversation skills, because that's what you said last time. So sixth place, huh, Speedy? It could be worse. Hmm. Oh, I get it. You're one of those all-or-nothing racers. And it's just all about the trophy. I wouldn't say that exactly. OK, so you're more of the fame and glory type. I don't think that's it either. Then what are you? Well, I'm really only here for my Granny. I'm trying to save our home from this psychotic toad. Save your home? Yeah. And not just my home. He's actually planning on destroying the entire loris village. The entire loris village? Yeah. And it's going to kill my Granny Bai. I just know it. Granny Bai? Granny Bai! Wait! You're that Zhi? I don't know. I guess it depends which Zhi you think I am. From the park at the Loris Day Festival. When we were kids, you were wearing a painted soup pot on your head. That was you? I looked for you a lot, but I couldn't find you. I never even knew your name. I still don't know your name. It's Shelby. Shelby. Why didn't I ever see you again? We moved to the city for my dad's job. My last happy memories are actually in that village. What? I just can't believe it's really you after all this time. I know. This is-- this is crazy. What are the chances? No, go back. What do you say we take a walk, Speedy? What's going on? Nothing. I just need to stretch my quads. Stretch your quads? I bet he's over you. I don't think he knows others. Time for round 2. Here, kitty, kitty. Not smart. And welcome, folks. It's fight night at the Happy Pagoda. Oh, I'm loving the party. So tell me something. What happened to old Bing? Did she ever actually start bottling and selling her own tea? No. But she's still claiming that when she does, she's going to be-- Deep in tea money. Oh, what about the Chu triplets? Are they still there? Yeah, they're all still there-- I think. I'm not really sure, actually. It's kind of hard to tell. Hey, you think you want to maybe-- I don't know. Are you asking me to dance, Speedy? I mean I-- Aw. The number you have dialed is no longer in service. Please check the number and try again. Gnash is in there. Oh, OK. Bye. Whoa, that the-- Gnash, hold on! I'm coming. Oh, snack time. Oh, boy. What is going on? This is weird. Wait a minute. Is this what Granny was always talking about? Holy golly. Did you see that? I did not. Oh, this is interesting. Excuse me. Not bad, Speedy. Not bad at all. Well, good day, race fans. It's Abby Jacks. And welcome back to day 2 of the Silk Road Rally. Oh, not necessary at all. Well, obviously, absolutely necessary. They're not the cheering for you. Of course, they are, horse of the sea who is hardly a horse at all. I don't think so. They are cheering for my best friend. Videos of Zhi saving me and by bambinos have gone viral. Viral? He doesn't even have a social media coordinator. Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! I think you got some fans. Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! Hey, slow loris. Emphasis on the slow. Care to engage in a classic raising of the stakes? What do you have in mind? If you win, not only will I give you the deed to your house, I'll give you the deed to the whole loris village. What's the catch? If you lose, you become my echo. Hmm? Deal. Aw! Hand buzzer-- classic. Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! Zhi! Hmm? What? We're talking away. I don't know what I'm to say. I'll say it anyway. Today is another day to find you shying away. Oh, I'll be coming for your love, OK? Take on me. Take on me. Take me on. Take on me. I'll be gone in a day or two. Take on me. Take me on. Take on me. I'll be gone. See that tree? Into that. Into that! Nice work. Nice work. I was talking to the tree. Congrats, you're no longer on my list. You, you're fine. You're fine. Take on me. Take on me. Take me on. Take me on. Well, that was weird. Well, you're not wrong. Unless Zhi has a rope and a trunkfull of tiny toads, he might be in some serious trouble. Aha! Hmm? All right. We did it, Gnash. Way to go, kid. That was awesome. There you go, little fella. Little fella? Come on, Gnash. We can still take the leg. Hey! Mama mia. Back up gently, gently. Oh, wait. My bambini! Zhi. I got a job. Oh, no. My bambinos! Berpe! Gnash, don't disconnect that hitch. We're going to lose a ton of time, kid. I know. But I entered a Silk Road Rally to save a family. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. Let's just make it quick, OK? Do you think this will work? Not a chance. I've got you. Punch it, kid. Punch it, kid. Oh, this is not looking good, folks. The weight and pressure are going to rip Zhi's car in two. Oh, he'd love two cars. Come on. Don't give out on me. Come on. Come on! Oh, no! Zhi did it! The queen is safe. It was super scary, guys. Ooh, yes! Berpe, Adalina! I'm so glad you guys are safe. Thank you so much for saving my babies and my Berpe. I don't know what I'd do without him. Well, this is truly a remarkable moment, folks. And one that I don't think we'll forget in a hurry. The moment went on unlikely. Little loris named Zhi became the face of this Silk Road Rally. Look, Granny Bai, look! It's Zhi! He saved all the other racers. New face on the Silk Road Rally. My goodness, look at what your boy has done. You must be so proud. Oh, I am. But I'm also so ashamed of myself. I wasn't ever really helping him find his ,, was I? I was just trying to force him to accept mine. So, folks, we are at the end of day 2. And what a spectacular day of racing it has been. Team Vainglorious nabbed first place again. No big surprise there. But the big story of the day is Team Muddy Meadows who has shocked the world by climbing into third place after a harrowing rescue. We are here with fan favorite and hero of the day, Zhi. So she we would be remiss if we didn't ask you the question that is on everyone's mind. If you hit yourself and it hurts, does that mean you're strong or weak? No. What were you thinking when you stopped in the middle of the race to rescue all your competitors? What was going through your mind? Talk us through it. Honestly? I wasn't thinking. My friends were in danger. Besides, I still have two more days. Like seriously? Two more? Well, Zhi, you definitely came off looking like a real winner today. Thanks. It's like an old friend told me, winners are always winning even when they're losing. s When I say vain, you say-- When I say vain, you say-- Idiots! Glorious! Reply is glorious! Idiots! Glorious! The reply is glorious! It's ironically hard to get a good call or response game with echoes. Ah! Daddy! Daddy! Good to see you, brothers. Good to see you, brothers. I'm so happy you can join the festivities in honor of and sponsored by me. A brochure? Archiebold you have risked our family's business over a bet. Bet? What bet? Oh, that guy. Don't even, daddy. He's in third place which is so many places behind first place. You couldn't even count him if you wanted to. If you lose Muddy Meadows, you lose everything. Everything? Please, daddy, I'm not as moronic as my brothers. No offense. Well, some offense. I've taken out an insurance policy. It's V. You don't have to say, It's V, every time. Your name shows up on my phone when you call. It's how phones work. Never mind. What do you want? Nearly striking out with the goat so it's up to you. You want me to beat up the goat? No, I want you to find Zhi's weakness. Greetings, dance fans. And welcome to the Nuorilang Falls Ball. And what a beautiful place to be. Hey. You realize. If you're tagged. Tomorrow. By 20 minutes. You'll only be. 10 minutes. From the go. If you can pull that off, mate, the next day, you'd have a real chance at the cap. Too right. Touch a nitro. I hope you seal the deal. Yeah, that'd be great. But nitro is a bit outside our budget which is nothing. Whoa, seriously? Thanks. This could really help us close that 29-minute gap, kid. Kid? So this is what a burgeoning superstar does in his off time. I'm no superstar. Oh, then what are you doing on my cup? So last time I saw you, I believe you were asking me to dance. Was I? Whoa! Looking good, kid. OK. OK, whoa, slow down there, Speedy. See? Isn't that better? Yeah. I like the way you dance. Then you should probably thank my Granny. She's the only person I've ever danced with. She taught me all my moves. Well, how do you like it then dancing with someone else? I like it. A lot less elbow skin. I'm sorry. I can't. Not like this. But wait! Shelby! Hey. Something get under your warts, V? Oh, there she is. Tell me what's the dirt on my little friend? You told me you were getting even with someone who double crossed you. You didn't say anything about hurting an innocent loris and destroying my childhood home. I'm out. You came to me appealing to my love of taking advantage of the helpless in their times of need and, in detriment, my evil whims, and asked me to have your father's name cleared for a crime that I clearly framed him for which I did for you and which, of course, I can undo. Therefore, when I say jump, you say-- You say-- How high? Right. And when I say side vegetable, you say-- Stewed carrots? Ooh, nice one. And when I say-- Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. Bop, bop, bop. What the-- Shelby and the Vainglorious? Oh, no, this is going to kill the kid. Well, don't let him find out until the race is over. And when I say dream first date, you say-- Moonlit dance beside a waterfall with a sweet guy who makes me laugh. I would have also accepted putting on a show. Slimy! How did I don't see it before? It's so obvious. See what? Perhaps if you're standing where I'm standing and I'm standing where you're standing, you could see what I clearly see. Go, stand where I was standing. Hmm. Huh? What exactly am I supposed to be seeing? You're right. It is worse this way. Go back, go back, go back. Hmm? What? What you are supposed to be saying is that you two silly lorises are falling for each other. You are the secret weapon I've been looking for the whole time. So wouldn't it just break his simple heart to learn that you've been working for me all along? Pow! No. Welcome race fans to day 3 of this Silk Road Rally. Today's course takes us right through the Stone Forest. - A - forest made of stone? I can't believe this. Huh? Oh, Zhi, great, there you are. In the car, let's go. I got to hand it to you, Gnash. You were totally right making a stop for Shelby. She is-- Dead weight, yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. That's not what I was going to say. You seem a little jumpy. Yes? What? What do you want? Here, let me get that for you. Gnash, what the? Oh, no, the window is broken. Shelby doesn't love you. She works for me. What's he saying? She does it long view rehearse the flea? Cuckoo, am I right? Uh-oh. Hey, Gnash! What the heck? These screens are a serious distraction. They destroy focus. You can't have that. You're welcome. All racers to your vehicles. Oh, yes, finally, here we go. Last night, dancing with Shelby, it was like a dream come true. But one I never even knew I wanted. Ah-ha. Well, look out. What if she never comes back? How could I ever be happy again knowing what life could have been? I couldn't, Gnash. I just couldn't. Then again, a winter wedding would be so Shelby. But a summer wedding-- Oh, enough already. You've been talking about this girl for 1,000 miles. You need to get your head back in this race. How's this for head in the race? Whoa, kid, that's 100% pure nitro. You will just-- Holy moly. Zhi just took off like a roo with a rocket in its rump. After I save Granny's house, I think maybe I'll get a place of my own, something worthy of Shelby, you know. I'm thinking karaoke room. Oh, for the love of-- Hey, seriously, what is up with you today? Who? Me? You're the one that wants to quit yammering on about Shelby when you should be racing. You're jealous. Oh, what in the world would I be jealous of? Me because it's not the amazing Gnash show this time. Oh, give me a break, wouldn't you? Team Muddy Meadows have broken the land speed record. Yeah, they're definitely going to crash. Whoa, we're too hot. Lay off the nitro. Come on! Whoa! Yes! Go, Zhi-zhi, go! Let's take another look at that finish. Yes, Speedy! You could have killed us. Nitro can't handle that kind of heat. You can't handle that kind of heat. Your pistons are misfiring, son. You are just like your mother. As soon as you don't get your way, you just fly off the handle. My mother? I taught her how to race. My mother raced cars? And she was great too just like you. But then this one rally, we were racing as a team. And I signaled to her to slow down and not take the easy pass, but she couldn't resist so she blazed by me. And-- and when she hit that next turn, she-- She what, Gnash? She-- she should have listened to me. What happened, Gnash? I lost my best friend. We could have been amazing. Could have been amazing. Oh, yeah? If I had middle fingers, you'd all know it right now. Hey, what's this? One, get out of here. Get away. Go on. Shoo. It's all mine-- the trophy, Muddy Meadows, totally conditional love of my family. Echoes, cue the victory simulation. Well, that was a dramatic end to a dramatic day, folks. He and Vainglorious somehow now both in first place. And with his car and his relationship with teammate Gnash both up in flames, there's suddenly no way for Zhi to finish the rally, let alone win it. He needs us. Hey, there she is. There she is. Oh, what are you so happy about? Haven't you heard? Zhi is out of the race. We did it! You and me, the two amigos. I don't want this. Oh, don't be shy. Take a pic. Shelby? Zhi, what are you-- what are you-- what are you-- what are you doing here? I came to make a trade-- me for the village. How noble of you. But seeing as your leverage just blew up-- what? Five minutes ago? Yeah, I was kind of hoping you didn't hear about that yet. I think I'll just take you and the village. Echo Training Program? Benefits? Wait a second. Why are you here, Shelby? What-- what's going on? Well, OK-- so this is a crazy story. You'll think this is funny. The thing is-- well the-- Oh, enough with the dramatic pauses. The lady loris works for me. No, no, wait. It's not like that. I hired her to destroy you. How did she do? She killed it. Speedy. Well, that was awkward. Oh, what an emotional roller coaster ride this has been for Zhi. And now, it looks like everyone's favorite slow loris is in for a dark night of the song. It feels like a saxophone moment to me. Zhi-zhi, where did you find that car? Kid, you're a force of nature. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen. When will you find your?? Going somewhere, Gnash? Granny Bai, what are you doing here? Making sure the past doesn't repeat itself. You need to help him finally embrace his.. I think you should talk to Zhi. You owe me this, Gnash. And you owe it to Zhi. But mostly, you owe it to yourself. It wasn't your fault. It was nice to see you again, Granny. You take care of yourself. Aw! Aw, aw, aw, aw, aw. Granny, let go. Oh, come on, Granny. Don't be an idiot. Well, that's a good one. Darn bumper stickers, why do they have to be so persuasive? So persuasive. Next race to start in one hour. What? The plant just knows how to grow. Zhi! Zhi! Where have you been? Come on, it's Berpe. Zhi! Look at what my Berpe did. It was awesome and a little disgusting. I swear I have a whole new respect for men. Come and meet the little tailbiters. They're so cute. Wow. Hi. They're beautiful. Everyone, say hi to Uncle Zhi. Look at him all tuckered out. I'm so proud of him. But doc says he's in no condition to finish the rally. Well, then, we can watch the last leg together because I'm out too. No, Zhi. This is where our road led us. But you, you need to get back out there and find out where your road goes. But even if I wanted to-- Zhi, we are a familia. I cannot sit here and let you offer this a hook. No. Familia, we push each other forward even when we think we can't possibly go on, especially when we think we can't. You can do this, Zhi. We believe in you. Shelby? I'm so sorry. Everything Vainglorious said is true. When we met, I was working for him but I didn't really know what I was doing or who I was doing it to. And then-- and then we met. And we got along so well. And you-- you were the kid with the soup pot on your head. And then I realized that you were fighting for the Loris Village which meant that I was the one trying to destroy it. Shelby, I get it. You didn't know. No, but that doesn't make it right. My whole life, I have been trying to find my way back to the village. And when you offered it to me, I betrayed you. But I want to make it right so that's what I'm doing here. I'm trying to do right by the guy I'm sort of into. The guy you're sort of into? She loves me! Did you guys hear that? She totally loves me. Whoa, slow down there, Speedy. We still got a race to finish. Shelby, I-- I blew up my car. There's no way for me to finish the race. There's-- there's not going to be a village to go back to. Unless-- Isn't this Neil's car? Not anymore. The starting line is the other direction. Oh, I know. Hey, wait. Gnash. Zhi? Gnash? What are you doing here, kid? I'm so sorry about what I said, Gnash. You've been nothing but good to me, and I blew it all up. We blew it up. I'm sorry too, kid. I should have told you about your mama sooner. And then when the road got rough, I just up and split without so much as a glance in the rearview. You know, truth is I would have been on that bus there too if an old friend hadn't stopped by to drop some wisdom on me. An old friend? Come on now, you two. I'm not that old. Granny! I'm sorry, Zhi-zhi. I never intended-- It's OK, Granny. It's OK. I'm so proud of you. You're proud of me? Even though I'm racing? Because you're racing. You found your ,, Zhi-zhi. Now, go save our home. I hate to be the one to break it to you guys, but I think it might be a little too late for that. Too late? But you're the one who said races aren't won or lost until the final second. Hmm? Yeah. Again, that's not what I sound like. Well, race fans, it's the last day of the rally. And with Zhi out, the only question on everyone's mind is-- Why don't croissants come in any other shapes? No, not that. Can anyone else left in this race actually beat Archie Vainglorious? Of course not. Where's Zhi? Yeah, he's totes going to miss the race. His village is going to be destroyed. We've got to find a way to buy him some time. Lovely idea, lads. All right, you lot, follow our lead. Huh? Tucks away. Well, that's just a waste of perfectly good people. Hey, what are you doing? 7 minutes in, and the other teams have a deadlock on Vainglorious. Wow, this map is really handy. Oh, we are four hours now. And these guys have no intention of letting Vainglorious pass. Well, hours? It was just 7 minutes like 12 seconds ago. Oh, that's a lot of numbers. My head hurts. I don't know what these guys are up to, but they're up to something. They're corralling him. Five trapped Vainglorious. Oh. And Vainglorious has broken free. Who would've seen that coming? Well, folks, it seems like it's a great day for evil everywhere as Archie Vainglorious has just secured himself a certain victory. Yey! Hang on a second. What's this? Some fool has just joined the race. Is that Neil? Oh! Oh, no way, that's not some fool. It's Muddy Meadows, the mini miracle! Mini miracle? Oh, that's a cool nickname. There it is, Shanghai! You got this, Speedy. If there's ever been a more exciting race for a cup, I, for one, cannot recall it. I've got to agree. That's because this is the first race you've ever seen, Juni. I've got to agree with you again. Steady, steady. Ha-ha! As if, loris. As if. I can't get past him. Not yet. Not yet. Now! See you! Yeah, way to go, kid. Right, left, right? Hold on. Speedy! Dang it! Back up, back up! You can get around him and take it. Coming down, look out! You're not going to make it through! Forward, Zhi! Forward fast, forward! Oh, Vainglorious has pulled ahead yet again. And this time, it looks like it's curtains for Zhi. What are we going to do? Gnash? I'm sorry. I'm all out of bumper stickers. Speedy? Hmm? Go save our home. What exactly is going through that giant head of yours right now, kid? Like you said, when I'm behind, I'm a force of nature. Oh, stiffen the wombat and thump the lizard. The mini miracle is headed straight into a colossal death spiral. It sounds like a very stupid idea. This is crazy. We're close to the finish line. No! Well, vanquish me Vegemite and call me a koala. You are a koala. The mini miracle has just won the first ever Silk Road Race! We did it! Hey. I'm his friend! Go, Zhi! Zhi, can I have your autograph please? That was great. Hey, you did it. What's up, Zhi? Hey, it's supposed to say the Amazing Gnash. Fired! Fired! Fired. Fired. Fired. Fired. Fired. Fired. Fired. Hey, Vainglorious. Ready to settle that bet? I'm sorry what bet was that? There you go. We got you, Zhi. Hmm? We had-- someone must have hacked my account. Daddy, you appeared to have accidentally nabbed me with your giant cool device. Yes. Look. We did it! Let me think. I never really liked that neighborhood anyway-- too many lorises-- sees? Lorisees? Lorises. Lorisi? Aw. I'm really going to miss that guy. Really? No. OK. Yay, Granny. Go, Granny. Go, Granny. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey. You know I seem to recall we've been here before. Or was it here? Actually, I think I was more like here. Oh, that's right. Hmm, I can't remember what happened next. Not this. Zhi-zhi, Shelby, are we going to play or not? Whoa. I don't know why I call you, Speedy. Hmm? Yellow mountain fruit peak? I know it was always your favorite. Your favorite? I'm still getting used to that. All right, game on. OK, but Shelby has to take it easy on me this time. Not a chance. I've been learning from the best. Thank you. Wait, I've lived with her all my life. How come I never learn to play like this? Because you actually have to listen. Oh, and as the sun sets over this happily restored Slow Loris community, there's only one thing left to say. This story is a lot like that turtle and the rabbit one. No, that's-- forget it. I get to be in the sequel, yeah? OK, OK. I got a rhythm in my body. No way, no way. Nobody's going to stop me now. Today, today. I'm going to hold onto the feeling, not going to worry about the reasons. No. The song is getting started to the beating of my heart. And it's getting me carried away. I got the feeling, feeling right now. Keeping it moving, and I'm making a part. Hey! This is electric, electric in there. Back in the rhythm and I ain't going to stop. OK, OK. Walking on the air like magic. No way, no way. I ain't going to let them drag me down. Today, today. I'm going to hold onto that feeling. I've been awaken from my dreaming. Oh. Something is getting started, the beating of a heart. It's getting me carried away. I got the feeling, feeling right now. Keeping it moving, and I'm making a part. Hey! This is electric, electric in there. Back in the room, and I ain't going to stop. Something getting started. There's something getting started-- the beating of a heart, the beating, the beating, the beating of a heart. Something getting started. There's something getting started-- the beating of a heart, the beating, the beating, the beating of a heart. I got the feeling, feeling right now. Keeping it moving, and I'm making a part. Hey! This is electric, electric in there. Back in the room, and I ain't going to stop.
