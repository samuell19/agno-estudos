Baby? I am so upset with her right now. Like why is he even there after he dissed her like trash. I understand they was unofficial, but after all the stuff she told us the other day, there is no way that bastard would be anywhere around me until after the baby came. Well, girl, maybe it's like the hormones or something, you know. Girl, screw that. She trippin'. I mean like, how does she not see what he's doing? How many wake up calls does she need. True, but we've all been there. I'm sure once she get enough, she'll bounce. Well, I hope so. 'Cause I hate to see her down. And speaking of down, you should have seen how down he looked when I congratulated him on the babies. Girl, he was shook. No, you didn't. Yes, the hell I did. The bastard wouldn't let me in my girl house. But, Nori, what if she ain't even told him yet. Guess I spilled the beans. Oh, my God. What you over there cheesin' about? No, I just got off of work. Sitting here with Nori crazy ass. Yeah. Okay, that sound good. Yeah, I'll be here. Okay, cool. Mm, I guess it's time for me to bounce. Like somebody got a booty call. No, I didn't with your nosy self. Lies. Girl, me and Renz ain't even slept together yet. I'm not saying it like we don't want to. I'm saying like, we just chillin', we takin' our time. - Whatever. - No need to rush. I don't believe you, but talk to your girl, okay. I can't deal with her right now. Girl, I will talk to her tomorrow. And Gis, wrap it up, okay. Unless you wanna spend every night for the next 18 years worried if your hustler baby daddy will come home. Bye. What? What Nate? What now, Nate? You fuckin' with our money. You mean my money. I don't got time for this shit. Look here, bitch. Don't fuckin' play with me. Let me go. You not runnin' a motherfuckin' thing around here. Now run me my goddamn money. And next time, you do what the fuck I tell you to do. Get the fuck out my car. Bae, wake up. Babe, wake up. I thought you were gone. No, I stuck around and made you something to eat. You been asleep all day. You good? Yeah, of course. Yeah, we never finished talking. Was there something you wanted to talk to me about? No, it can't wait until I have more energy. I been tired and stressed lately. See. That's why you need to eat. You made my favorite. And some red Kool-Aid. You must really be sorry. Just eat. Mm, mm. You want some? Nah, I'm good, I ate earlier. Nori came by here for you, too. She did? Mm. What'd she want? Nothing. I told her you'd give her a call back later. Mm, mm, mm. Here. Your drink. Ooh. You know I don't like off-brand Kool-Aid. Is this Wyler's? Here. It could be me 'cause my taste buds been jacked up lately. Look, hurry up and finish. I gotta make a run. Really? What's that supposed to mean? So I guess you gotta get back to her, huh? Man, look, Tash, I ain't got time for that shit today. I'm not in the mood for that bullshit. Just finish your plate so I can take it and go wash it. Fuck it, I'm done. I'll wash my own damn plate. Just lock the door whenever you leave. But look, finish your drink, you trippin'. Happy to see you, too. Whatever Renz. What's up with you? So you don't have nothing to tell me? No. Can't even be real. So, you ain't a drug dealer? That's why you carry that gun around, huh? And your phone stay busy. Oh, you a hustler. I'm not gonna even lie to you, Giselle. Yeah. I was gonna eventually tell you when things got right. What the fuck, Renz? You got me out here in the dark and not knowing shit. Oh, my God, being at your house. Anything could have happened. I'm sorry, baby. I just figured what you didn't know wasn't gonna hurt you. You know I wasn't gonna let nothing happen to you. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I didn't want you out here worried. Well, I'm worried. Damn, it's like you don't even fuckin' understand. I told you about my mother and my sister. That shit hurt me every time I gotta see her out here all strung out and shit. I don't fuck with no street niggas, Ren. Because of the street, that's why I'm motherless. The same dude that took my mother got my sister all drugged up and molested her. Say, just got her out here selling her body and shit. Fuck, I try so fuckin' hard. Giselle, you gotta understand. I'm not the man that you think I am, but I need you to trust me. Trust you? You know, I figured all along, but when I asked you and you told me no, I thought I could trust you then. What is it, you can't trust me? I trust you, but you gotta understand, it ain't easy for me to put this shit on people, Giselle. What you want me to say? Hi, my name is Renz and I'm a drug dealer? Well, you could have considered that when you was pursuing me. You didn't even give me no choice. Got me out here fraternizing with the enemy. Lovin' all you. You know what? Just get out.

So you didn't know Renz was a hustler? Yeah. And so you didn't think that was something I needed to know? I tried, but tell me something. Just a few weeks ago you was talking about how good a man he is and how sweet he is and how he makes you so happy and shit. Would you have given him a chance if I woulda told you? No, 'cause you know I don't deal with no hustlers. And I respect that, but you cannot give up on your happiness because of your standards. If he a good man like you say he is, then I promise you, he gonna make you comfortable. I ain't gonna lie, I do miss him. I know you do. So call him. He probably won't even talk to me. If he don't, then let it be. But if he's as good as you say he is, he ain't gonna let you go baby, okay? Now let's go. Go get your stuff, we going to the spa. Shit. What's up boss man? Money, what's up? Ain't shit. Just checking on things. Where O at? Up up around. Tell you they got Pop today. Pop? What'd they get. Nothing that I know of. This bag kind of light, though. What the fuck going on around here, Ricky? How come nobody called me? Anybody call you Money? Shit, man, hell, no, nobody called me. I can't leave you niggas for more than a couple of hours 'fore some shit go bad. Y'all the sort of thing just sneaking around here, huh? Hey, hey, hey. You got something you wanna tell me, nigga.

How am I gonna know everything gonna be okay? You gotta trust me. So, what this mean now, like, I'm a trap queen or something? A what? You don't want that shit. Honestly, I'm getting tired of this shit. Money coming up missing. Niggas going to jail, partners dying. Damn, I'm sorry. Nah, don't be. I been hustling since I was 14 and I always had me a solid team around to kind of keep me off the radar, but niggas just been slippin' lately. On top of that, my fuckin' brother home. Now, I know it's a lot of stuff that you ain't gonna be able to tell me, but I've really learned to respect you a lot more these last few months. I just don't wanna lose you to no mess. You know, sometimes, I think my mother loved these streets more than she loved us. And I never knew my dad. But, you know, like every now and then a new nigga would come to the house and say he was our daddy and stuff like that. Giselle, even though I'm a hustler, I move different. I mean that's why I got the club and a few other spots around town. So you mean to tell me, you got all the finer things in life and nobody to share it with? I ain't been in a real relationship in years. Didn't want to 'cause I knew what came with it. But seeing you made me realize this might be my last chance to catch that train. I ain't tryna miss it. I don't know what it is about you, Giselle, but you been on my mind, my heart, my soul, heavy, since the first day I met you. I mean, I've had things that weighed me down, but this weight, this weight is different. It's a weight I yearn to carry for the rest of my life. I love you, too. What up, nigga? What? I'm on my way. Sorry, babe. Gotta go. But I wanted some more of you. Save it for me, huh. Hey, can you pass me my phone on the bookshelf, please. Yeah, I got you. She don't know this. Is something wrong? No. Here. Thank you. I'll be back. 911, what's your emergency? What the fuck? Low, come on Low, come on Low, come on Low. Low! What the fuck happened? Low was on the corner posted up. He heard gunshots and came running. They popped him as soon as he hit the door. Nigga, this a one way street. How the fuck they get passed Low? I don't know. Was they driving? Yeah, yeah. Check the cameras. Yo, Renz, I just ran the motherfuckin' cameras back and I ain't see shit about no motherfuckin' black SUV. So you mean to tell me them niggas slipped past this nigga standing on the only motherfuckin' corner on this block. Renz, let me fuck this nigga up, man. Renz, that ain't it. I popped one of them niggas. He dead. He in the kitchen. Man, that's some shit you say from the start. I wasn't tryna get caught up. Hold up. You got something you wanna tell me, nigga? Man. Renz, what the fuck. Man, I ain't do shit. You sure about that? I swear, man. Man, chill! Man, let me kill this nigga, dawg. Put the gun down, Mo. Put the gun down, Mo! Stop crying like a little bitch. Clean this shit up. Call me when it's done. We shutting this shit down. Hey, man, hold up, man. We can't just shut down the spot, man, that's our money maker. I'll do what the fuck I wanna do, Money. All right. Hey, check this man. I'm a go by the east, man, check on things, man, make sure everything good. Yeah. No worries. Be careful, man. You know, Nate gonna be coming for his body soon. Damn little bro, what's happening? What the fuck you doin'? What you mean, I'm happy to see you. Fuck the small talk, nigga, what you need, money? A spot? What is it? You ain't changed a bit. Still a fake ass doughboy. I don't need nothing from you, man. What the fuck is you talkin' about. Unlike you, I'm the real brother's keeper. You ain't never gave a fuck about me, Rome. The reason I'm reapin' this bullshit I am now is 'caus of a dumb ass mistake that you made. One that almost got us both killed and your ass locked up. You was ruthless, nigga. I still got the scar to prove it. Yeah, you sat in that cell, but you left me in a fuckin' hospital bed on life support 'cause you was scared the cops was gonna come and get your ass. It's always been about you. I coulda died, nigga. What brother was you keepin' then? Look, you really want me to believe I ain't take that bid for you just now, man? Ain't nobody puttin' no motherfuckin' gun to your head. You chose to follow me, nigga. That was the best move you ever made in your motherfuckin' life. Fuck you, nigga. Hah, nah, fuck me? 'Cause you went around here with all these businesses, got your little lady friend and all that type of shit. Nigga, I know you, nigga. You fake. You could never run the streets like me, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. You see this shit. I built this shit, nigga. You fooled yourself brother. Get the fuck outta here. I don't wanna see your ass no more, nigga. I'm your brother, Renz. You dead to me. Fuck you! Mr. Reed. Just the man I was looking for. In a rush? How can I help you, Detective? You can start by helping me help you. I need you to go down to headquarters with me to tell me your whereabouts on the night of September 10th and what you know about Nick Jones' disappearance. I don't know what you talkin' about. Ah, but my sources, they tell me that you do. I ain't going nowhere without a warrant. You're not the only smart one, Mr. Reed. Go ahead and book him. Turn around. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, I'm sure you can. Let's go. You sure you just don't wanna come chill at my house? No. I can cook you something. You really need to eat. No. Cocaine. Cocaine, Gis? I've never done anything other than marijuana. I know it was him. A cocaine overdose. I'm so sorry Tash, I really am. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Trust me, he's gonna get what he deserve what way or the other. I could have fuckin' died. And my baby. And, I lost my baby. Tash, everything is gonna be okay. We all here for you. Look, I don't, I don't mind staying for a little while. I just need to be by myself. - Okay. - But thank you. Tash, I love you. We both love you. Please don't be mad at Nori. She had no idea you was gonna be hurt. She didn't have any idea that he didn't know about the baby. Man, fuck Nori. Fuck her, I don't have no words for Nori. It's like that bitch can't seem to see anybody else happy but herself, she's selfish. Tash, don't do that. That is your friend. You know she would never do nothing to intentionally hurt you. Says the one she called fat our entire childhood. Oh, shit. Look. If you callin' to fuss about Tasha again, then you need to, um, do something friend, okay, 'cause I can't deal with that right now. Girl, I'm not even worried about that. Plus, I've already said what I had to say. Anyways, the reason I'm calling, have you talked to Money or Renz? I been calling Money, but he gonna call me back soon. I hope he okay. I mean the last time I talked to him he said he had an emergency and like just ran out the door. Girl, chill. They probably just handling business or something out of town. I told you when they handling business they don't like to be bothered, okay. I told you this the other day. Why you all worried now? I knew I shouldn't have let my guard down. I knew I should never gave him none. I hope you make him wrap it up. What is that noise? Bye, Nori. Hey. Hey, how you doing? I'm doing good. Drew, is it? Yeah, that's me, how can I help you? Hey, I'm sorry to just barge in like this, but- - What's up? I'm just trying to figure out do you know where Lorenzo is? Oh, I remember you. No, I ain't seen him since yesterday. It was pretty late when he came through. I been trying to call him, but his phone be going straight to voicemail. There's some cats around here been asking about him and I think that's kind of strange. It's not like him not to answer his phone, you know. Yeah, I know. But at least, I mean, did he say where he was going? No, when he came in, he was pretty pissed. He took like two shots and he dipped out. That's all I could tell you. Well, now I'm worried. Yeah. You think I could leave you my phone number? Yeah, sure. And if you hear anything, can you please give me a call. I got you, Mama. Thanks, Drew. Ah, no problem, be careful. Nori! - What's going on? - They have him. Oh, my God, they have him Gis. Have who? They have Money. I don't know what to do. I knew something, I knew something wasn't right. Is he in jail or something? No, Gis. Some nigga that hit up the spot the other day took him. Ricky said they gonna kill him if they don't hear from Renz. Renz? Where the hell is Renz, Gis? I don't know. Look. Nobody has even seen or heard from him in days. They took him. I'm scared, I'm scared. Okay. Wait. I can call Drew down at the club. Okay, let's see. Hey, Drew, this Giselle. You know Renz friend? Yeah, have you heard from him yet? In jail? No. Don't even worry about it. We'll go get him. Thank you, Drew. Girl, come on. Hey, I am so glad you're okay. Take care. I got you. My God! This is all your fault, Renz? My fault? What did you do? I don't even know what the fuck going on. Come on, come on! Where the fuck is Money? Where the fuck is he? Right. Take me by the club. Gotta get my car. That's my jam. ♪ You drove away ♪ ♪ Here's my story ♪ ♪ I ain't never seen a man made ♪ You been in my shit, bitch, huh? Huh? Now you gotta get somebody to pay for that, don't you?

Look man, whatever this is is between you and me. Money ain't got nothing to do with this. He's what you call involuntary collateral. Collateral, nigga, I don't owe you shit. Which is exactly why I don't understand you taking out my main man. What? Nate, if I took out one of your men, trust me, you wouldn't know nothing about it. Now let him go. See, this right here. This is my motherfuckin' establishment. You don't run a goddamn thing around here. I thought you understand that, Renz. I thought we had a clean operation going on. But I guess I was wrong. What the fuck you talkin' about? According to your main man, here. You the one that set up the call, set up the pickup. Tried to off one of my men, killing one of them. No dirty work my ass. Now you know how I get down. Body for body. Motherfucker, you! I knew you was stupid nigga, but I didn't know you was dumb as fuck. Nigga, what? Nate, when have I ever not come to you about business myself? True. You or Money. That's exactly why when I got the text, I just made the call. Text? You motherfucker. Where the hell are they, Gis?

We're gonna have to call the police. What? Girl, hell no. Hell, that's gonna look like a set up or a bust or something. What you know about a bust. I guess you just hustler savvy now or something. Girl, whatever. Sit down. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? This nigga tryna set us up, Nate. He knew if I killed you, your men would be coming for me. This nigga been a leech and now you're blindin' his way to come up. This nigga lyin'. I don't know what the fuck he talkin' about, Nate. If that was the case, why would I bring him to you?
