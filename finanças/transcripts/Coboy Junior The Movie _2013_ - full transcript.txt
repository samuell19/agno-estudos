- Hi, I'm Kiki. - I'm Aldi. - I'm Bastian. People call me Babas. - Hi, everyone, I'm Iqbaal. - We're... - Coboy Junior. Okay, we first met on Laskar Pelangi Musical. - Then we met Patrick... - Effendy. LASKAR PELANGI MUSICAL - 2010 Thanks for the time. I'm Patrick Effendy, a music producer. I watched them on stage. Amazing. - I have a project for them. - They're still kids. What project will you give them? They're not construction workers. - Music project. - James, listen first. - I am listening. - Vocal group. - Boy band. - Oh, vocal group. - That's right. More stylish, modern. - That's good. Hold on. Aren't they too young to be part of a boy band? That's the thing. Starting at this age, they'll become more mature later. And there's no kids boy band on an international scale. We'll think about it. But thanks for the offer. And we also need to discuss it with the kid later at home. How about this? Let's say that I'm representing the parents here. Basically, I agree. But if there's a problem one day, I'm willing to replace them. - That can be done. - Liston. They're the ones being offered, not you. - If you join the boy band, then me too. - Okay, here. It's my business card. They have talent. I believe they can be amazing in the Indonesian music industry. Just call me, I'll be waiting. Whenever you want. - Where's Aldi? Come here. - Aldi! - Where's the sausage? - Come here. - Aldi! - Come here. - Tian! - Bread. - Bas, come here. - Aldi. About that boy band offer, honestly, I really support that. I'll back you up. That's a progress. I hope one day you'll replace Bataknese pride singers like Yudi Sitanggang, Charles Hutagalung, even the famous North Sumatra singer, Eddy Silitonga. - True. - Uncle, you're so old-fashioned. Why Eddy Silitonga? He's a solo singer, not part of a boy band. - He can't move a lot, he's old. - Tian... If there's the name of the clan behind, such as Silitonga, he's not from Solo, he is from Batak! Just like us, Simbolon. You need to know, Bastian. How can you, as a Bataknese, not know that? Someone named Silitonga must be a Bataknese, from North Sumatra. There's no way he's from Solo. Unless it's a Bataknese who lives in Norway, then it's Oslo. - Right? - It's just a word jumble. What I mean isn't Solo, as in the Indonesian city. - So? - But when you sing by yourself, alone. Ridiculous! No way someone sings alone. You can't be an egoist, you need to socialize. Eddy Silitonga doesn't live alone. Although he sings alone, there must be a band behind him, and also an entourage. Right, James? If there's someone from Solo, it could be the musician! Uncle, that's not what he means. A solo singer is someone who sings alone, not in a group. You're so serious. I'm just joking. Just forget it. Your father and uncle are the same, they love to joke around. When you become singers, and become famous and popular, you need to stay humble. You can't be arrogant. There's a Batak saying... Ton, translate that. Liston, you're a Bataknese. - Why me? - Because you're a Bataknese. Here it is. "As high as a squirrel jumps, that squirrel will never compete in the Olympics." You're just making that up. You're embarrassing Bataknese. That's not what it means. It's been so long since I've left North Sumatra. Don't listen to him. He makes things up. The saying means, "Like rice panicle..." Make this gesture, Bas. "Like rice panicle, the fuller the rice in it, the droopier it is." - You can't be arrogant. Stay humble. - That's what I mean. - I didn't say squirrel at all. - Squirrels eat rice. Just let it go. - Use your right hand. - Okay. Little brother, are you seriously going to join a boy band? Of course. What do you think? Dad? I'm still not sure about that offer. For me, school is more important. Just relax, I promise I won't forget about school. Don't make a promise hastily. A promise is a debt. And I don't want you to make a promise only to us. You also need to make a promise to yourself, and to Allah. Okay? Remember your task and obligation in this world. We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Have you done salat Isha? - Is it already Isha time? - It is. It's been a while. Remember, the best practice is to do it before. I'm the one who's gonna have to clean the table. Little brother! Ki. You haven't gone to sleep yet? Not yet, Mom. What's wrong? Tell me. What do you think we should do about this offer? If you like it and you're gonna do it seriously, I will always support it. But there's one important thing... You can't let others down. You also have to mean it. And more importantly, you need to give your best. - Are you ready to do that? - I hope so. I really want to be a musician like Dad. I want our family to be better. I don't like seeing you go to work early and come home late to support us all. I want to help you. Can I? You're such a big boy now. "WOMEN DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF A NATION, BECAUSE THEY'RE THE FIRST SCHOOL FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING..." So we believe our parents' blessing is everything to us in order to be better in music and singing. - That's right. - Because we all know heaven is under the feet of our mothers. Whoa! Whoa, so many posters here. That's Slank! Whoa, there's Purgatory! I love them, especially the DJ. So cool. Chubby, yet cool. Hold on. Where? We're offered to be a boy band, aren't we? - Yeah. - Why isn't there any boy band poster? - There's Trio Libels there. - Where? A trio consists of three people, there are four of us. Can you count? - Do you wanna compete with me in math? - Okay. How do you do Pythagoras on a triangle? What? - I can. - What? - See? I can. - What are you doing? - Here's Pythagoras. - Enough. Who knows, we're the first four-person boy band that'll put up here. Listen to Kiki's words. Lovely on the ear, cools our hearts. Wait, Kiki, make it more rock so I can dance to it. Okay. - Is it "bento" or "asyik"? - Bento. - The title's "Bento". - Hey. - Big brother Patrick. - A boy band's key to success. Unified, solid, uniting differences. That was cool. Let's jam together later. - Okay. - Now, let's take the attendance. What do you mean? Sorry. Teuku Rizky Muhammad. Born in Jakarta, Aceh descent, January 4. AFI's champion, afraid of dogs, loves science and math, shoe size 42. Dogs are scary. Iqbaal Dhiafakhri Ramadhan, Surabaya, December 28. Finished reading Al'Quran in the age of 8, then you became an ustad. - Gadget freak. - Gadget freak, and loves Justin Bieber. And you love white and purple. And the most important thing, your curiosity is sky-high. Kepo. Of course not. But how do you know all that? Kepo. - Sharing. - Sharing. Okay. - Alvaro Maldini... - Siregar. - Simbolon. - We're Batak brothers. April 14. Idola Cilik's finalist. And the most important thing, you have the complete Shaun the Sheep video collection. I have to borrow them. Annoying! Last night, someone was caught watching Shaun the Sheep before bedtime. - So that's why you look like sheep. - Last, our champion. Bastian Bintang Simbolon. September 21. Great at dancing. Emotional and doesn't like to be called "short". - Who called me "short" earlier? - Who? I take that back. Try listening to this first. His voice is like a rocker. Okay, that's it for now. We just have to find the range. Adjust it with your range, with the help of big brother Anggi. - Sir? - Yes? Find the range. Try it. - Iqbaal first. - Too high. It doesn't feel good? - Too high. - F. Make it lower? - Yes. Not too high. - That's perfect. Put this down. Now try imagining there's a girl in front of you and you're singing directly to her. - You're so trendy. - Bring it here. Just relax. Imagine there's a girl in front of you. Just sing. There! - Embarrassed! - Iqbaal! - Yeah! - Yeah! What makes you uncomfortable? Nervous? You don't feel relaxed? What? - It's my first time. Sorry. - Just smile. What's left is the name. It must be simple, catchy, unique, and represent you. But most importantly, easy to remember. Your first gig. The place is cool and popular. Not many can perform here. Really? Seriously? - Cool. - We'll watch an amazing performance. A boy band, consisting of four adorable little kids. Give it up for Coboy Junior! Coboy Junior. For me, it's really cool. A cowboy, sturdy, and great at shooting. We started to have a lot of fans. But for us, fans aren't just friends. They're like soulmates. That's why we call our fans comate, AKA Coboy Junior Mate. That's right, my boy. - I want to take a photo with you. - Of course. What are you doing? Hey! Hi, Bas. Bas, come here. - What? - Who's that? So angelic. That's Lo Vely, she's called Lovely. I don't know why people call her that. - So beautiful. - Come on. - Hey, take a photo of me. - Wait... Aldi. Can I take a photo with you? Take a photo. Cheese. One, two, three. - Thanks. - You Bataknese. Come on, let's go! - So pretty, Bas. - Yeah, yeah. Come on. - Aldi! - Give me your signature! No. - Is it on? - What's on? - That thing. - Of course. - Hi. We're going. - Bye. - I'm going. Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi, too. I'm Aldi. Everyone here knows who you are. Your photo is in every school magazine. Oh, I'm Lovely. Are you... - Are you sick? - Me? Sick? - I heard you just fell down. - Fell down from where? Aren't you an angel fallen from heaven? The bell's ringing. I'm gonna go to my classroom. Bye. When can I enter your heart? Enter my bag! Enter! - Bataknese sweet talk! - Annoying! Youngsters nowadays. When you're holding your phone, you forget about your company. It makes people who are far, closer. It makes people who are close, further. One thing's for sure, someone's close to the heart. I don't need to tell you. We already know who. That guy. - Orange glasses. - Smiling without a reason. Mentally disturbed. - See? I'm right. Lovely. - Give it back. "Hi, Aldi. What are you doing now?" "I'm hanging out." - "Hanging out where?" "In your heart." - Bastian! Give it back! - There are still some things below. - Annoying. How cute. "Hang out with me." Enough. We need to focus. We need to figure out how to make Coboy Junior soar higher! But we already have a lot of fans. That's the thing. We can't always be satisfied. Do you want us to only perform at school events? - That's right. - We need to be famous nationally. - Internationally, if we need to. - That's cool. - To Korea. To the US. - You want that, don't you? Especially when you go there with Lovely. Guys. There will be an event called Xplode. This is a boy band/girl band competition in Indonesia. The winner gets a trip to Korea and one billion rupiah. - Let me see. - I swear. Look. There. Cool. - I saw it accidentally while browsing. - That's a cosmic event. A crazy coincidence. That's why we need to talk carefully or it'll come true. There's no coincidence. Guys, we still need to win it before we can go. Then let's win it together. - Agree! - Let's tell Brother Patrick now. - Come on. - We can do it! Korea awaits! Are you sure you want to join this competition? It's not just playing around. The stake is your good name. That's the thing. What if we lose? What are you talking about? We haven't even started and you're already giving up? That's not what I mean. I'm just afraid Comate will be disappointed if we lose. But Babas is right. It's rare that he's right. Great. - Why are you all clapping? - Sorry. Face it, don't just think and talk about it, and don't be afraid. Di, listen. Don't be afraid. Here's the thing. Whatever you do, as long as it has good intentions, I'll support you. As long as you're not only following other people, just for fun. I think we need the challenge. To measure our capability. Agreed. I support that. Face it as a team. The most important thing is here, the intention. - Are you ready to compete? - Ready. - Ready to be the best? - Ready. Louder! Where's your energy? Ready to be the best? - Ready! - Okay, group high-five. I'm on top. Co-co-co-co boy-boy-boy-boy Junior! Comate! Chronic, bro! - Where are you going? - I'm going to meet someone. - How are you? - I'm good. I mean, how's your family? They're also good. - Let's sit. - Okay. What a cool park. Jakarta should have more parks like this. That's right. This is the biggest park in Jakarta. - Really? - Yes. I think the biggest park in Jakarta was TMII theme park. Love, there's something I need to talk about. What? Actually, I... - What are you doing here? - Picking you up. Today's our last practice. We'll have our audition tomorrow morning. - Are you gonna join us? - You're right. I thought love was blind. It turns out love is amnesia. - Annoying. - Amnesia! Come on! Rather than losing your memory, you'd better practice. For us, joining a competition is important. We can hone our talents there. We can also learn not to be easily satisfied. And the most important thing, we can learn to always show sportsmanship. To accept defeat and know how to act well in success. "SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS WILL UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF WHY THEY'RE CREATED..." AUDITION Is this the right place? It is. Whoa! So many people! What are you talking about? So many people. Just see for yourself if you don't believe me. Ta-da! Look. By the way, what's that? Why is it so crowded over there? - You're right. - Come here. - Where? - There. Look. Cool. Another boy band? Who are they? Please, how can you not know them? They're Superboys. Cool, right? Especially Brandon. How cute he is. Lovely? Nothing special. My boy band's better. Hey, what did you say? You said my boy band's not special? Maybe you heard wrong. If your boy band's great, let's just see who will pass later. Hey, use a magnifying glass to make your vision clearer. - Enough. - Who will pass later? You better continue your practice. Sorry. Bas. Don't be like that. - Hi, Love. - Hi, Di. - You're here. - Of course. You joined this competition? Yes. Hey, Di, look. I took pictures of Superboys. They're so cool, especially Brandon. So cool. Di, Brother Patrick is calling us. - See you later. - Bye! - You've practiced, now focus... - Movement. - Movement. Harmonization, performance. - Move! We're passing by! Mother-father! How arrogant he is! - Who is he? So pompous. - Iqbaal's right. Dong-suk, a Korean boy band trainer. Forget about him, he is arrogant. - Ki, lead our prayer. - Come on. This is our first audition. I hope we succeed. Let's pray according to our beliefs. Let's start. How are you? Where's the noise? Hello and welcome to Xplode Indonesia! Today, hundreds of boy bands and girl bands will audition and show their best talent. But today, I'm not alone. There's a judge panel there. Welcome, Dewi Sandra. Iwa K! And Nirina Zubir! It's time to start the competition, Xplode Indonesia! Superboys. Cute faces. Your choreography and vocals make our heart beat fast. Superboys. Superboys. Super expression. Superboys, super okay! Coboy Junior. From a dance point of view, you're too regular and boring. But vocally, you're pretty cool. Yeah, I have to be honest with you. But your movement... For me, from the first time I saw you, I already liked you and fell in love. So, other technical things, you can add them later... No. The technical side is important. What you perform on the stage has to be complete. You can't say, "The technical side, we can discuss that later." We do like them... - But as I said, they sound good. - Okay. - So, it's fair enough. It's enough... - But voice alone isn't enough. - They also need to dance. - They can. Where's the organizer? Organizer? - Bro? - What? The technical side. Should you take that aside? The choreography and everything? The vocal's the most important? For me, it has to be complete. The show. There's choreography and good vocals. I mean they can sing. - So just give them a chance. - The basic idea is a vocal group. Let's just discuss it backstage. We'll announce the decision later. - Let's just continue this. - Okay. This is the moment we're waiting for. After the judges had their discussion, the first contestant continuing their journey is The Bangs! The Rainmaker! Superboys! Honey K. Three 4 Step! Two Monkeys! Dazagi! Sky Poppers! Little Green! The last contestant going through to the top 10 semifinal, congrats to... Coboy Junior! That's our 10 Xplode semifinalists. Make some noise! And there's one new rule from the organizer and our judges. Every contestant that makes it to the next round can bring their own dance crew without reducing the member of their group. See you on the semifinal of Xplode Indonesia! - Congrats. - Congrats. - Do you wanna see the photos? - Of course. Forget it. I'm certain we'll be better than them next time. - Right? - You're right. - The video, please. - Video? Hold on. - Bastian, where are you taking us? - Just follow me. - I don't want to if it's scary. - Relax. - Come on. - There's nothing mystical about this. - Just relax. - Don't lie. Why are you so afraid, Iqbaal? Come on. Hurry! You'll be surprised to see this. - Wait for me. - Hurry! - Why is this place scary? - It's not. Trust me. Guys, come here. These are my friends. I've known them for a long time. Whoa! Crazy! What a great dancing! - Introduce them to us. - Okay, come on. - Amazing! - This is Fay and the crew. Cool! - How are you? - Hello. - Hello, Iqbaal. - Crazy. So cool! Cool, right? By the way, why is that boy wearing pink shoes? Praise be to God. Who said I'm a boy? - Don't drool. - Oh, God. One day, okay? Three or four more years. You're not allowed to date. Just straight to engagement. - Cool! That's right. - I'm Kiki. - Fay. - I'm Aldi. - Iqbaal. - Fay. - Not too long. - Sorry. Fay, they're my team. Introduce your team to us. My team wants to know. Come here. Let me introduce them. Phitos Animal Pop. Ali Lil 'Boiz. Cool! Memet Rock Ski. He's Fadil Krenz. Little kid! He's Raymond Frezhmotionz. Ibam Bamsky. She's Zara Nyenyes. - For us, practice is important. - True. Just like when we have a dream. We need to have a determination to reach it. That's why we always have a discipline when we do our practice. And we're sure it's all for our improvement. "WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT WE DO TODAY..." We moved on to the next round, right? We need to practice harder. Especially with Fay and the crew. We need to be cooler. - Okay. - Group high-five! Okay. We can do it! Co-co-co-co boy-boy-boy-boy Junior! Comate! Chronic, bro! Out. Follow my move. Don't just stand there. And four... Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three... The competition's getting closer. There's no other word other than you need to be number one. You have to win. Be the champion. Don't smear my name. - Understand? - We understand, Coach. Crazy. I never practice this hard. It feels like my knees are gonna pop. Me too. But it's for the improvement of our boy band. - True. - High-five. - Another toast. - Mine's finished. - I still have a little left. Look. - You still have a little left. - Just a little. I can't lick it. - Why did you pour it? Dirty. Aldi? - Oh, my! - Lovely? What a coincidence meeting you here. Yeah, a lovely coincidence. I'm having a birthday party tomorrow. Here's the invitation. Come, okay? - Certainly, I will come. - Okay then. Bye. - Aldi's the only one invited? - Don't you know us? - She only knows Aldi. - Hey! No. Everyone's invited. Come, okay? - Bye. - Bye. - Progress. - You always ruin my beautiful moment. We're your loyal friends. We'll accompany you to her party. Loyal? You're always interrupting. He's happy inside. - Give that to us, you have a lot. - He got a permission to get close. - Give that to me. - But she stopped him. - Whoa! - Hey! Remember, don't embarrass me in front of her. - Just relax. As if you don't know us. - Slow, bro. We won't embarrass you. You'll have no obstacle. What are you doing? You haven't even said happy birthday to her, but you're already eating. Sorry. That's Lovely. Let's go there. Hi, Love. Here's a present for you from the four of us. - But I'm the one who paid for this. - No, we paid for that too! I'm the one who paid. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Lovely. - Happy birthday, Lovely. Happy birthday, Love. I wish you a long life and more beautiful. - Thanks. - What's this? Lovely. Your beauty is at the maximum, you can't get more beautiful. Okay? Because your beauty is like an angel from heaven. Don't listen to Aldi. - What are you doing? - Ouch! - Why did you pull my hair? Annoying. - You're annoying! - We have to compete fairly. - Fairly? Enough. - Hold on. - See? She's leaving. - It's your fault. - I haven't tried the cake. Come on. - You eat all the time. - Come on! - How are you? - How are you? Phitos. Zara. - You know Lovely too? - Who doesn't? - Cool. - But where's Fay? I don't know. I don't hear from her. - Have you met Lovely? In the back. - Let's meet her first. - Okay, we're gonna eat. - Bye. Friends, thanks for coming to my birthday party. To make this night more fun, I've invited a cool boy band. You will know them. Let's give it up for Superboys! - You invited that Brondong guy? - You mean Brandon? Of course, he's my cousin. Hey. What a coincidence that you're here. Let's do a battle. I wanna see if your boy band is fit for the competition. Sorry, let's just compete in the competition, not here... - Okay. - Aldi! - We have not prepared! - Aldi! - No. Sorry, we're not prepared. - We haven't done our practice. - Aldi. - Don't worry. We're here. Brother Phitos! Aldi. Aldi! Aldi. Forget it. Look at me. - We're sad if you're like this. - It was my chance to defeat Brandon. Hey! Why did you try to do hand stand? You haven't even practiced that one. Hand stand is my specialty. Got it? Relax, Di. You'll get Lovely's attention next time. Next time? When? Does she celebrate her birthday every week? - Slow down. - Relax. - I'm relaxed. - Enough. This is dangerous. Remember, there are three things that are cause rifts. Wealth. Power. And women. This is the most dangerous. If we do it wrong, it can be poison to the world! That's too much. Okay then. Even though you didn't get Lovely's attention, you still have us. Iqbaal's right. Let's pay attention to Aldi. Are you cold? Let me give you my jacket. Here. Cold? Seriously? You swear? Sweater? Not funny! Your hair looks like a sweater! Why are you like this? Once again, we'll never be bored of practicing. - Practice is more than important. - Practice makes perfect. I always pray to God to not make me lazy to do my practice. Amin. - Good afternoon, Brother Patrick. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hello. Where's one more? What are you doing? You look so serious. Arranging your practice schedule. What do you think about this? - Every day? - Almost. There are still some days off. - So little day off. - You're in the top 10. You need to practice more. Ready? - Are you ready? - We're ready! Hey, Fay's waiting for you to practice in the studio. Come on. - Bye. - Okay. - Is the food ready? - It is. My heart breaks when I have to face you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm going to practice. Honey. Where's Iqbaal? Why is he not home yet? Maybe he's still at practice. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you too. Where have you been? Why are you coming home this late? I was practicing. The first time you joined the boy band, I told you I'm not sure of your promise. Am I right? Now, your exam is coming soon. But Coboy Junior got into the top 10. Just listen to your dad first. From now on, you'll focus on your studies. Study, study, study. Don't forget your task and responsibility. Don't have the wrong priorities. Okay? - Ki? - Brother. - Brother. - Where's Iqbaal? I didn't hear from him. Try calling him. I'm worried something happened to him. BROTHER KIKI He isn't picking up. What's wrong with him? Go practice without Iqbaal. Keep your spirit up. Come on! We can do this. When we're so passionate about practice, a problem always occurs, especially when the source of it comes from within that group. Like that time with Iqbaal. We got into trouble too. Iqbaal's not coming again today? That's the thing. I tried calling him since morning. He still doesn't pick up. - Why is Iqbaal so weird? - Your position is weird. That's right. Let me fix my position first. - What should we do? - What should we do? - Let's just practice without him. - Okay. - Come on! We can do this! - Come on! Keep your bag first. - Have you done your prayer? - I have. You can't force studying. You have to have the will and the seriousness. There, I brought you books. Read them, okay? I'm not even finished with this one. You can. That's what you have to instill. Don't make a target of 100%. A thousand percent, then you'll get the 100 percent. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay then. Continue your study. Tidy the books later, okay? Okay. Okay, we're done. Thanks to the crew and Fay. Top 10. Take a lot of rest. - Okay then. We're gonna go home now. - Okay. Come on. - Thank you, brother, Fay. - Thank you. - Bye, Brother Patrick. - Ki, Bas. - Yes? - Where are you going? - Just ask Brother Kiki. - We're going to Iqbaal's house. Because we haven't been able to reach him since yesterday. - Let's go together. - Together? - You're paying for dinner again? - Yes, eat. Eat. Listen. It looks like Iqbaal can't join this competition anymore. Why? Is he sick? No. I'm just worried his boy band activity will interfere with his studies. Here's the thing. I've told you from the beginning that these kids are talented. It'll be such a shame if we don't maximize it. They can be huge in Indonesian music industry. But there's a consequence. If Aldi, Bastian, and Kiki can split their time, I believe Iqbaal can do it too. Here's the thing. You can't compare that kind of thing. Each kid has their own way to study. Between Iqbaal, Kiki, Babas, and Aldi, they're all different. They have their own purpose, motivation, and capacity. And I'm not sure Iqbaal can do both. There's a higher priority in his life. And as a parent, I want the best for my son. - Okay? - I understand. Photosynthesis is The food cooking process by Green plants and leaves Helped by sunrays You can hear him yourself. He even sings while studying. - Brother Patrick... - Here's the thing. Before I go, I want you to reconsider what these kids can achieve in the future. I don't mean to interfere. The decision is in your hand. Okay. I appreciate your effort and hard work. But... Iqbaal already has a task and responsibility in his life. That's the main thing. Dad... Can I say something? Yes? You always say that since I was born I have a task and responsibility to take on. To worship God. To be useful for my family, my religion, and my nation. That's what you talk about everyday. But we both know we worship God not only by salat. Studying, going to school, giving alms, even smiling at someone is to worship God... until one day when I need to make a living for my own family. But... all those responsibilities I can only do with my willingness. But here... it's my right to determine where and how to do those responsibilities. It's my right to choose the thing that suits my heart. Iqbaal... are you sure that when you join this competition, there's a benefit for you in the future that suits what you said? God willing, I'm sure. I give my permission. But... you have to promise me, okay? You won't give 100% for this competition, but 1,000%. I promise. One more thing. Salat is still number one. Of course. Thank you. - Thanks, Uncle. - Thanks, Uncle. - Thanks, Auntie. - Thanks, Auntie. Iqbaal. Make some noise! For the first performance tonight, here it is... Singing while dancing isn't easy. But you did it easily. Next... Next, something super, Superboys! Steven, Fajar... Wilson who danced amazing! And also Brandon. Okay, Superboys. Two thumbs up for you. Can you lend me your thumbs? Four thumbs for you. Superboys, you're cool! Okay, judges and viewers, tonight, our last contestant prove... This is the moment. Don't waste the chance your parents gave you. Make them proud. Make yourself proud. Prove that you're the best. And I'm sure you are the best. - Come closer, everyone. - Brother Phitos, Brother Fadil. Co-co-co-co boy-boy-boy-boy Junior! Comate! - Chronic, bro! - So chronic! Here it is... Kiki, Aldi, Bastian, and Iqbaal, each of you has a unique vocal. But out of everything, I love your wonderful choreography tonight. And one more thing, we can already see it here that you entertained everyone. You're swag, cool, and amazing. - What's swag? - Swag is... single, relaxed, anti-confused. I'm sure your performance today will make your mothers proud. Okay, Indonesia, in my hand there are three contestants moving forward to the grand final. I believe it's not an easy decision for the judges because the contestants have shown their amazing talents, dancing, vocal. But only three enter the grand final. And the first contestant moving on to the next round is... And the second contestant moving on to the next round... The judges' decision is... They move forward to the grand final! Guys, come here. If you don't get into the final, no problem. The important thing is solid. Keep your spirit up and believe in one thing. God always gives us what we need, not what we want. - Are we certain? - We are. Keep your cool, stay handsome. Smile, look to the front. - Face this with bravery. - Yeah. But I'm nervous. - Cool and handsome. - Me too. Ten contestants, two have moved forward. Who's the other one who will accompany The Bangs and Superboys to the grand final? The jury has decided... that contestant is... Believe! Congrats to the three contestants moving forward to the grand final! See you on the more spectacular grand final! - Co-co-co-co boy-boy-boy-boy Junior! - Xplode Indonesia! Comate! Chronic! Where have you been? Why are you late? Sorry, Coach. We were exhausted last night. We haven't rested well. - That's right... - Not an excuse! Look at this. The Bangs. This one, Coboy Junior. They're getting more solid! Their dance is getting cooler, their voices are getting better. You should be better than them. You're Superboys! You're super boy band. From now on, your practice time is doubled. Especially you, Brandon. Your voice needs to be better than them. This boy band's win depends on you because you're the front man. Got it? Yes, Coach. Our heaviest competitor is Coboy Junior. I will never accept a loss! We need to win. Understand? What? Do what I just said! Don't dispute me! Understand? - Brother Patrick. - Hey. Brother Pat. - You rested well? - We did. - I can't wait for the final. - True. But what are we doing here? We better do our practice. We better be here, get to know the stage. - Come on. - Okay, we can do this! Move! You better go, because this stage only belongs to the champion, which is... Superboys? What's this? We came first. We should practice here first. You Dong-dong! - His name's Dong-suk, not Dong-dong. - Fifteen minutes. We're first. - What did you say? - What do you want? - Organizer team! - Whoa. What's happening here? First practice, Coboy Junior, 15 minutes. Hold on. Who first? Coboy Junior came first. - You can't be like that. - Thanks. Please go. Okay, Patrick, please practice the blocking. - Study math well. - Let's do this. There will be Fay and the crew here. The stage is huge, we can be wider. - The other way around, right? - But it's 1x8. First blocking, come on. Aldi! - What? - Ki! - Kiki! - Brother Kiki! Ouch! Don't move. Where's the organizer? Don't move him. Call the ambulance, Bas. I've been suspicious of them from the start. I'm so mad at them, I want to... We believe that something that is done not in a good way will result in something not good. "FOUL PLAY IS AN IDEA THAT ONLY COMES FROM THE MIND OF LOSERS..." - How is he? - Here's the situation. Kiki's neck bone shifted a bit. And he has a neck muscle injury. - So he needs to wear a neck cast. - I understand that. For now, he will need total rest. Sorry, doc, but can we speed up the healing process? I don't think so. Right now, he just needs to rest. - Excuse me. - Yeah, thanks. Brother Patrick. Kiki's injured. What should we do? He's right. The grand final will be held soon. Let's not talk about the grand final for now. We must lift Kiki's spirit up to avoid him having a mental breakdown. Go do that. Don't talk about grand final. Okay. Poor guy. - You can get through this. - Poor guy. - I'll massage you. - What are you doing? Stop. Still. What? I... Wait. Listen. I'm talking now. Listen to me. I just want a dispensation... Sorry to Fay and the crew if we're not enthusiastic today. Yeah, sorry. It's okay. I hope Kiki gets well soon. Amen. - Okay then, let's start again. - Come on! We start from here. After this, you kick. Okay? Ready? No, I don't ask for any accountability. I know that's the judges' decision, but... - What's wrong? - Nothing. Something just fell. Let's take a break today. Is it okay? Okay. We're done for today. Maybe we'll practice again tomorrow. Bye, everyone. Iqbaal! - Come on! - Let's go! Hold on. Wait! Hi, Love. What's up? There's something I wanna ask you. What do you want to ask about? I'm ready. I wanna know how is Kiki. He wears a neck cast and he needs total rest. Poor guy. And what about Coboy Junior? Let's go. We're gonna leave, Love. We need to visit Brother Kiki again. - That's right. We're gonna leave. - Send my love to him. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Open your mouth. - Let me do it myself. No. When I feed you, you eat more. - Let me do it myself. - Do you wanna recover? - It's hard for me to swallow. - Just eat slowly. But you still need to eat a lot, for your recovery. - Yes, but let me eat myself. - Okay then. - I'm here to make sure you eat a lot. - Okay. - That's it. Let me take some more. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you too. - And upon you too. Auntie. High-five. Hey. - Have you eaten? - We have, thanks. - Here. Eat. I'm going to clean up. - Okay. - Bas, make sure Kiki eats a lot. - Okay. It's great, isn't it? Visiting someone's house and eating their snack. - Cool. - What grade are you in? - Third grade of junior high school. - Age? - Fifteen. - Still being spoon-fed? Annoying. It's because I'm injured. - Let me feed you. - Annoying. - It's spilling! - Brother Kiki. Does it still hurt? - Well... - Wait. It is a little sore. But you can already dance like this, right? Arrogant. Has someone ever burnt your hair? - No. I'm joking. - Just burn it. No. Brother Kiki. If your condition persists, there's only one cure. - What? - Patience. - Do I need to say, "Wow"? - Not "wow", but "Alif". - True. - Then "ba, ta, tsa, jim, kha, kho..." - Then "wow". - Smart. Brother, Lovely sent her love. She said, "GWS." What's GWS? - I thought it's for when you're biking. - That's gowes! How's your progress with Lovely? - Nothing. - Tell her I said thanks, okay? Okay. I apologize. Because of me, there are only the three of you at the final. It's okay. We still have Fay and the crew. But we will still be missing you. Why is there... so many hurdles for us in this competition? It could be a hurdle or a warning for us. Trust me. Even if this is God's test for us, remember that God won't test us harder than what we can bear. The four of us can do it! For the best. - What do you mean? - A toast. The best. - For the best. - For the best. For the best. - Ouch, it hurts. - He's really drinking it. - Bas! That's my drink. - I'm thirsty. - You'll get his injury. - He went for snacks, then my drink. My house is nice, isn't it? The terms and conditions are clear. Check it out again. I've read it. I got it. But we know what happened on the stage is the organizer's responsibility. Wait, what do you mean? Sorry, the accident. I'm not asking for any compensation. I took care of the hospital's bill. - It wasn't our fault, was it? - That's right. I just ask one thing. Don't disqualify my kids, Coboy Junior. That's all. We can't not. That's the rule. Wait. - Hey, bro. - How are you? - I'm good. - He's Coboy Junior's manager. - Okay. - There's a problem. We all know what happened. I just want the discretion of the organizer and the judges to not to disqualify my kids. Sorry, bro. The rule of the competition is set in stone. We, as the judges, can't do anything about it. Moreover, it's not fair to other contestants. I get it, but we need to think about them. They're still young, they still have a lot of spirit. They'll be devastated if they lose this way. I get it. If the dance crew member lose its member, it's fine. But it's different for the vocal group, that's just the rule. - I know that, but help me here. - What can I do? That's just the rule. - Just let it go. - Agree. - Okay? - Okay. I'll be coming with you. - Okay. - Okay? So sorry. What's wrong? Why are you looking so sad? "During the competition, contestants can't add or subtract the number of its members." - You added the dance crew. - That's different. It's okay for the dance crew, but not for the singers. So Coboy Junior will be disqualified. This is what I'm afraid of. In life, you can't disappoint anyone. Your father once said every breath we take, we need to use it as much as we can for ourselves and for others. Are you sure you've given your best for everyone? Is there no other way aside from... disqualification? - Brother Patrick. - How will it be? The rule is clear. We can't add or subtract our members. So we're disqualified. The judges' decision can't be changed. It looks like you have to wait until next year to prove that you're the best. We can't say "wow" yet. If we can do it now, why should we wait until next year? - Brother Kiki? - I can say "wow"! Remember, not wow, Alif first. - Okay. - Slowly. - Hi, Bas. - Brother Kiki. - It still hurts. - Brother. - Di. Iqbaal. - Auntie. - Ma'am. Healthy? - Thank God, yes. What are you doing here? Why are you not resting at home? I wanted to watch you practice, but hearing what you said, I just realized something. To be the best doesn't mean we have to win a trophy or get the acknowledgment of many people. To be the best is to give the best of ourselves. - Cool! - Cool! Nice quote, bro. And I don't feel like I have given my best. Ma'am, what do you think? Can your son practice for the competition? Don't ask me, ask him personally. - I can do it. - Hold on. Wearing a neck cast, can you follow our moves? We move our lower body parts, you only moved your upper body parts. That's the thing. I may not be able to follow your moves but you can follow my moves, can't you? We can, but using the head, okay? Let me touch it. One, two, three, four... Then to the left. - Where's my position? - Below is better. The others, open. Like this. On the right. On the left, the opposite. Yay! It's a must. My dream is for Coboy Junior to be the best. Actually, the best is always within us. It's up to us to get it out. 1,000%. Nothing's impossible if we try and have a strong determination. Good evening, Indonesia! Make some noise! Tonight, we have the grand final! A spectacular round because there are three boy bands who will give their best performances. They'll be competing for... Now is the time for you to give your all. Show all of your abilities. Especially you, Brandon. We only have one purpose here, to win this competition. Only a loser who will go home without the trophy. - Got it? - Got it, Coach. Indonesia, for the first performance tonight, it'll amaze you. Here it is, a performance by The Bangs! Our next contestants, they're ready to be the champions, fly to Korea and win one billion rupiah, here is Superboys and crew! Amazing! They really are not Supermen because they are Superboys! What a cool performance. Where are Superboys' supporters? As Kiki said, tonight we're not proving that we're the best. What we're proving is that we're able to give our best. Now, that's the place to do it. - Pray. - We can do it! - Let's pray first. - Okay, everyone, let's pray. Let's pray according to our own beliefs. Let's start. James, come here. They start in a second. Move! Aldi's father is coming. Everyone else, move. - Give way. Come on. - The competition is getting hotter. But there's one last contestant tonight. I never asked for anything. I only ask for one thing now. Give the best to them. Let's give it up for the boy band who call themselves... What a great performance! Give it up for them! We saw the solidity of a boy band. Limitation isn't a hurdle for them to show their best. And now is the time for the judges' comment. I have to say to The Bangs, Superboys, and Coboy Junior, you really entertained us here. We're amazed by your hard work. You have proved that this is the result of doing something out of love. Give it up once again for our three amazing boy bands! But once again, this is a competition, so we have to choose one among the best. We've conferred. And the winner tonight is... Sorry that we lost, Coach. Yeah. How can that mediocre performance win? They're cheating. - That's right. - True. They don't have a great voice. They have a weak dance routine. Coboy Junior is good. They're better than us. If you can't see that, then you're not worthy of being a winner. I trained you hard. But I never teach you to have a bad sportsmanship. Accept defeat! - Who wins? - Us! That's right. What's this? Do you wanna fight? Come on. I'm ready. Congrats, Bas. You're welcome, bro. Your boy band is cool. And sorry for that time I was being uncool to you. I also apologize for when I said your boy band is mediocre. - It's okay. - Even bad. - Congrats. - Okay. - Who wins? - Us! Brother Patrick! - Congrats on your win. - Thanks. Your performance was so cool. Who's that? Are you doing anything this Saturday? - I don't think so. - Then... But I have a practice session with Coboy Junior. I want to focus on that. - Sorry, Love. - It's okay. I'm going to go. Bye. Bye. I'm not dating her. I want to be like Iqbaal, 3-4 more years. - Great! You're cool. - Good. We won! - Great! - Cool! We win. We'll go to Korea. Let's hope Kiki's condition is better. - I hope it'll be better. - Brother Patrick. Honestly, I don't really wanna go to Korea because I know Indonesia still has a lot of places that are much cooler. That's right. We need to explore every city in Indonesia. One of them is Lake Toba, my hometown. It's so cool. My hometown too. And I also want to go to Bunaken. Diving. Okay, how about this? We find a promoter. We go on a tour all over Indonesia for a year. Okay? But because we are fortunate to go to Korea, we go there first. Agree. But don't play hide and seek there. It'll be hard to find me. - That's right. - Are there many Bataknese in Korea? Not like that. "TO THE WINNERS, A DREAM IS A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE..." We're certain that dreams can come true. As long we try seriously. And one more important thing. Never give up. That's right. Do your best and never forget to pray to God and ask for our parents' blessing. - So true. - Amen. Don't make a mess while you take a bath or you'll make our bedroom wet. - Whose laptop is that? - It is provided. - To browse the internet? - "Whose laptop?" Okay. - There. - There. There, that's right. Come on. Bastian! This is Gang Nam (6) street. Now, where's Gang 7?
