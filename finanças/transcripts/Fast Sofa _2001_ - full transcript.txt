Radio announcer: Good morning. It's a beautiful day in downtown Burbank. 'Comin' up next, here's my best of the number one song of 1989. Let's go, Rick. I can't afford to be late for work. Hey, come here. Rick, I'm serious. Get up. We can play later. No, later sucks. I'm way more into now. I know, Rick, but work is normal. It's what people do in the daytime. [Sighs] Yeah, whatever. [Sighs] Ah. [Music plays on TV] [Rick laughs] Ginger: No! Come on, you bad girl. No, no! No, you have the wrong girl. I'm telling you, it wasn't me! It wasn't me! Oh, no, don't handcuff me. No, no, no. [Moaning] Oh, no... Ooh, you have the wrong person. Oh! Oh, no! Police officer: Cuff her to the bed. Assume the position. Oh! I am in the position. [Laughs] You go, ginger. Now what? Are you removing your clothes? I am in the position already, yes. No, way. Ah... Ooh, oh... Oh. So you'll pick me up tonight? Yeah. Don't make me wait, Rick. That place is a pit, and I'm dressed like charo. [Laughs] Hey, dude, where-- where the fuck you been? Rick: Oh, I don't know. Tamara's been buggin' me. I'm runnin' low on cash. She wants me to get a job. [Laughs] Rick: You know what the worst thing about lookin' for a job is? Jack: Enlighten me. Finding one. [Laughs] So you gonna pound the pavement, or what? Fuck that, man. This is america. I think it's time to harness some of that entrepreneurial spirit. What is that, blow? No, dude. Ecstasy. Mdma. The love drug. You fuckin' crazy, man? I thought you were broke. Well, see, that's the beauty of it, man. The dude fronted it to me 'cause he knew I could sell it. You wanna know why? 'Cause drugs are dependable. They sell themselves. You set the price, they pay it. Demand-side economics at its finest, baby. Groovy.oh... Hey, I got you these. A little present. Tamara and I went to magic mountain last night. Oh, hey, man, these are excellent, except for the fact that disco's written all over them and they're butt ugly. How do I look? Oh, bad-ass, baby. Super bad. Rick: So, what do you say, man, Mac in the box or taco hell? Jack: How about burritos?[Siren beeps] Fuck. The police, dude. Aw, dude. Chill out, please. Fuckin' Nazis. Oh, shit, man. You know, you just don't like 'em 'cause they got a badge and you don't. No, I just don't like people tellin' me what to do, and I especially don't like people who get off on messin' with my life. What the fuck are you doing? You're fuckin' holdin' drugs. You look like you're holdin' drugs. Now chill out. Cops are losers, man. They're a waste of taxpayers' money. In fact, the only reason we have cops is because of those stupid real life cop TV shows. So what? So they're cheaper than actors. Big deal. You're such an outlaw, dude. Company man. Cop lover. Jesus, man. Just fuckin' mellow out. [Tires screech] [Rick laughs]Jack: You devil. [Laughs] Those glasses rule. They look so hot. Heh. You wanna check some of this? No, fuck that shit, dude. That's a waste of... Totally reminds me of that white trash chick, Angela. Remember her? Rich, spoiled Angela from Pasadena? I wouldn't classify her as white trash-- more like the rich bitch variety. Man, all we would do every night is just tons of coke. We'd fuck all night long and then drink cough syrup to come down. Her lips were like a red, sticky bliss. What are you talkin' about, man? She cold dumped your ass. You were heartsick for, like, weeks. It was not pleasant to watch. It--it's just the way love is, man. That's the way chicks can be. Shit happens. Hey, dude, I... I feel kinda high. [Laughs] Oh, shit. [Laughs] It's osmosis. The--the ecstasy's seepin' through your skin. You're coppin' a buzz. Oh, shit. No, I can't get high, man. I... I got an n.A. Meeting. [Laughs] Oh, man. Mmm. Oh, right. Hey, so what's going on with you and Tamara, anyway? I don't know. She's been all over my case lately. She's tense about life. She's all talk-talk, worry-worry, suffer-suffer... And the other day, she talked about kids, you know, like, having them? I mean... I don't think she meant tomorrow, but... Someday, right, and... God, throw in the marriage thing. It's too hairy. Tamara is serious heaven, dude. Heh heh. I don't think I'm ready to sign off on the whole forever gig. Are--are you messin' around on her? No. I don't know, man. Sometimes, I just wanna want her more. I guess it's like havin' a Jaguar with leather seats and a wood panel dash and a kickin' steering wheel, but just kinda... Just kinda havin' a hankering to drive an airbrushed Van with shag carpet, swivel seats, and a 8-track stereo, huh? [Rick hacks] God, I gotta kill this love. Thanks. None--none-- none for me. I'm done. All right, you need some of this. Have some of this Mexican moonshine, bro. Come on, snap out of it. Come on, just have some. Whoa. Oh, my god, looky what we have here. You see--you see, this-- this is why I love Hollywood. You know who that is? I don't know. Some chick with big tits. That's my favorite porn star, man. That's ginger quail. Tamara and I watched one of her videos last night. Tamara? She watches that shit with you? Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, as long as the sex isn't too dirty and the people aren't too ugly. [Whispering] Oh, man, look at her. Look at her! Dude, um, you know what? I'm gonna have to cut out. No, no, no, no, no. You gotta stay here. You gotta--give me-- give me 5 minutes. She is full-on swivel seat monster shag carpet, if you know what I'm sayin'. My god, this is a crucial opportunity. You gotta hang. You have a girlfriend. Man, she's so unreal. Yeah. Not a fat chance. I gotta--i gotta get some air. I'm gonna go for a walk, ok? I'll catch up to you later. [Horn honks] What are you staring at? You, ginger. I'm a big fan of yours. Is that right? A big fan? Yeah. A big, huge, throbbing fan. Well, I've got a lot of fans, honey. Some even bigger than you. See you around, tiger. Nice wheels. I got a nice set of wheels, myself. Do you, now? Yeah, a real machine of the road. Rides like hot buttered velvet. You wanna flip for it? For what? For your hot-buttered car? No. Which one we take to go get a bottle of Tequila. I don't drink Tequila. I only drink champagne. Perrier-jouet. The kind with the petals on the bottle. Fresh out. Oh. What good are you? Make you come for a dollar. I can make myself come for free. Yeah, but you'd have a lot more fun if I was there. Really? Cocky little bastard, aren't you? All right, let's give it a try. You drivin'? Always. And don't you forget it, tiger. Whoo! Better strap yourself in. This car goes really fuckin' fast. [Tires screech] [Both laugh] Nice. Cheers. Mm-hmm. [Rock music blasting] Wanna fuck? Whoa. Hello. [Laughing] Oh, god. How do you wanna do it? Figured I'd use my cock. Get over here and fuck me hard. [Ginger moans] Ok, let's go. It's almost midnight. You want a ride or not, baby? I gotta go. I'll walk. [Moaning loudly] That was worth a dollar. [Laughs] [Phone ringing] Hello? Tamara, on phone: Hey, Jack, Rick didn't show up. Can you come get me? Yeah. No. Sure. Yeah. I'll--I'll be right over. Ok. Ok, bye. Rick: Who's Robinson? Ginger: My husband. So, uh, quail's a stage name? No, it's real. Like the birds, you know? Oh, don't worry, he's in the Navy right now. He's in the Philippines. I almost never see him. He just sends postcards. He's on a submarine or something. Nice digs, for a sailor. Don't violate me, you barbaric heathens. Oh--ooh-- oh, don't touch me there. High priestess of porn, starring ginger quail. Looks like you really enjoy your work. Yeah. I was really in the moment here. Oh, no, not the secret spot! Oh, my god! So, are they supposed to be torturing you? No, I was supposed to be torturing you. Well, it's working. You're killing me. Oh, wait, wait. This is a really good moment. Aah! Aah! What happens next? What happens next? Uh, well, what do you think happens next? Um...they fuck your lights out? No, I fuck their lights out. Mmm. Oh, wait, put this one on. This is a really good one. This is one of my best sellers. It was very, very popular. It's good. It's, um-- it's about these girls. They're on the beach in Malibu, and then all of a sudden they realize there's no boys. There's no boys anywhere. So, they have to kinda take care of themselves. They have to make themselves come and everything. Yeah. Wow. I like this one 'cause I'm really kind of natural in it. Um, I think my acting is sort of subtle. That's not my real hair. That was a wig. Oh, that girl there... [Gasps] Oh, my god, she was such a bitch. She was always telling me what to do. You know what? I just Rose above it. She's not the star. I am. That's what I always have to keep telling myself. Let me take that uncomfortable bikini top off. I don't want to get any tan line. No. Uh-oh, look at that. I'm out of champagne. Would you be a sweetie and get me some from the refrigerator? Yeah. Yeah, it's in the kitchen. I can do that. Yeah. It's in the refrigerator. There's lots and lots. Ginger, in video: I wish my breasts looked like yours. My breasts are getting really red. [Moaning] Uh, careful there. Watch your fringe. Thanks for the ride. You gonna be all right? What a jerk. Yeah, well, you know, it's Rick. He probably passed out or something or got stoned before. Maybe that piece of shit of his he bought broke down. And every phone in L.A. broke down, too, right? What a prick. Wanna--wanna do something? You wanna get a drink, or... Uh, yeah, sure. I don't know. I mean, you wanna go for-- go for a ride? Porn actress: Ooh, you girls are so creamy. Slippery. Mmm. Oh... So, what's your next movie? Oh, you know what? As a matter of fact, I'm gonna be in palm Springs this weekend. You could come out, if you want. Um, you can meet me on Monday night at a club called the vesuvius for happy hour. [Sniffs] I don't know. I been pretty busy lately. I'll see if I can pull it off. Want a snort? Oh, no. Oh, come on. No, thanks. Come on. Loosen up. I've got lots. All right. Thanks, sweetie. Yeah, I'm going out there. I'm gonna make a film, and i'm--also, I'm doing something else-- a friend of mine is gonna take headshots of me, so, you know, I can try out for some straight stuff. Really? Yeah. So you take classes for anything, you know, other than fucking? I don't take classes for fucking, ok? I'm a natural. But, I am saving up my money so I can take some acting classes, 'cause, you know, it's really important to have technique and everything. What's the matter, you don't think I'd be any good? Well, you know, I just-- I think you're kidding yourself. I mean, how many porn stars go on to be, like, regular actors? A lot of 'em do. A lot of 'em. Like, for example, what about Traci lords? She was in a lot of movies. She was in, um, she was in-- um, she did not of this earth. And sh-- what about Linda lovelace? She wrote a book. She wrote several books. I think she wrote 3 books. So what? Who reads books? Uhh. What about Marilyn Monroe? What about Marilyn Monroe? Oh, come on. Everybody knows about that. Back when she was what's-her-name, she made that porno loop. You know, her playing with herself and stuff. Give me a break. That wasn't her. Yes, it was. It was her. No, it wasn't. It was too. It was a fake. It was, like, some other chick. I saw the pictures myself. I saw 'em in penthouse back when I was a girl. I mean, she was fat and she was kind of gross, but it was her, all right. It was when she had brown hair, you know, and her name wasn't Marilyn. It was, um, Mary...something, or something. Norma. It was Norma something. Norma Jean. You remember the video Elton John did when he was dressed up like Beethoven? He's gay, right? Who, Elton John or Beethoven? Elton John. Oh, totally, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe he was going after liberace. I'm not gonna get that. What? Aids. They said liberace had aids. Yeah, that-- [Sighs] That would be a serious drag. Yeah, it was. Hey. Here comes ginger. [Laughter] You're just everyone's toy, aren't you? No. I get paid to make people like you think that you can have me. I'm just a fantasy, really. That's my job. Yes. Oh, really? Oh, yeah? Aaah! No! I always have to be on top. Aaaaaah! I'll show you a fantasy. Ha ha ha! You're... Overpowering me. Oh, my god. You could be a porn star, you know. [Moaning] Are you living in the hallway now, brother? [Groans] Man, the key is... Broke off in-- in the door. Oh, this is bad business. This is gonna run you. No, no. Fuck that, dude. This is your door. I-I-It is the responsibility of-- uh-uh uh-uh. What do you think you're doing, brother? I'm trying to get away from you, brother. Oh, shit! What is it? I ju--i forgot to mail a letter. I'll talk to you about the door later. Leave me alone. [Knocking on door] What happened last night, Rick? I waited all night for you in the restaurant. My place got robbed. Of what, your record collection? Well, I guess that's what you get for being such an outlaw. Are you hungry? I'll make you a tuna sandwich. Oh, god, I feel like I haven't eaten in a couple of weeks. Man, those fuckers. I can't believe it. My whole place is turned upside-down. Everything's all over the floor. My albums are all over the place, totally scattered and unorganized. The couch is all ripped apart, the window shades are down, the pink flamingo we got from palm Springs fell over. Thanks. Rick? What? I mean, you just-- you knew I was waiting for that ride. You knew I needed you to pick me up. Yeah. Well... Uh, it was just this thing, you know, just no big deal. Um, just kinda... Got it out of control and stuff, and, um, it wasn't a big deal or anything. Out of control? Yeah, uh...Well, you know, I mean-- uh, Jack and me were hanging out, having a couple of beers and, uh... There she was. Ginger quail. Right there, live in the flesh. It was just-- it was crucial. It was an opportunity, you know. I mean, how often does that happen? What are you telling me? Ginger quail? A porn actress? You fucked ginger quail? It wasn't against you at all. It didn't have anything to do with US. It was just-- it was just crucial. It was hilarious. I was safe. Ok. Safe? Safe. Do you realize you fucked a porn star? You fucked a porn star, and it's ok because you used a condom, and the whole thing's hilarious? Right? It's just hilarious? I'll tell you what's crucial, Rick. I am crucial. I'm crucial. I am totally, totally crucial. I know you are. I know you are. Really, it wasn't a big deal at all. [Groans] Tam, tam, it's not-- get the fuck out of here! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Tam, it's really not-- I want you out of here. Get out of here! Tam, listen, i-- get out! Damn it.

Whatever. Instead of blowing up helicopters, girls just moan. Same deal--just a bunch of people out of control. [Laughs] Hey!gimme your money, man. Come on, man. What's up? Where's your money?

Yeah, I love 'em. Fried chicken, roast duck, Turkey sandwiches. Now would you get out of here? You're interrupting my chow. Got it? I'm afraid you're not a friendly man, not very sympathetic. I understand. It's, uh, reflexive to distrust a newcomer. It's not necessarily, uh, instinctive to have, uh, sympathy. Oh, take the tale of the good samaritan-- [horn blares in passing] Heh, the good samaritan. What? The good samaritan. It's from the Bible. Look, you were right about me, squid, ok? I'm not a sympathetic man. I eat sympathy for breakfast. So take your good samaritans, fly off a freeway overpass. Where are you from? Arcadia. Arcadia? You mean like off the 210 freeway arcadia? Yes, of course. Are you familiar with another arcadia? No, I just thought when you said arcadia you meant, like, you know, a hospital or a treatment facility. Oh. You know, like the arcadia glade or the arcadia general or the psychiatric ward, you know, the safe place where they kept you. Oh, the safe place. You mean the safeway, the supermarket chain. [Wheezy laughter] [Sighs] Ok, I'm outta here. No more of this. I'll see you later, birdman. Much later. I--excuse me, one more thing. Yes? I happen to be very hungry at the moment. I'm without the means-- dude, you are the worst. First you give me this good samaritan crap, now you're spare-changing me? [Chuckles] You've got balls. I would never ask unless, uh... Things haven't been going well. I was--i was robbed. Well, you're in luck. I happen to be a little flush right now. There. There you go. Thank you. I wanted to offer my thanks. Later, squid. And, uh, ask for one more favor. I understand it's an imposition. [Sighs] As I was without the means to feed myself, I'm also temporarily without the means to return home. Beat it. Ok. All right. Um... I'm on my way-- I'm driving by arcadia. Yeah--really? Get in. I'll give you a ride. All right. Thank you. Well. Want a beer? I don't drink. Your problem. Well. Ahh. Ahhh. Very nice automobile. Thank you. It's an American-made machine. Buick skylark gs. Really? Yes, sir. Last of the big, bad beauties. V-8, power central. Jules: Going traveling? I'm a man of the road myself. Always loved the vistas, and, uh, great leks, the swoop of the kestrel. Right. Great. Yeah, that's, uh, something else. What is the purpose of your journey? I'm going to the desert to get laid. You know, bonk. Hump. Fornicate.oh. [Laughs] The desert's good for that kind of thing, you know. Sunshine, swimming pools. Cold, dark cocktail bars. Good lekking territory. What? Uh, it's a part of the mating system. Uh, certain species of birds travel to, uh, traditional sites year after year in order to, um... Display in competition for females. It's actually, uh, very exciting as they inflate, uh, brightly colored air sacs on their necks. Great. All right. So what exit am I dropping you off at? Do you perhaps, uh, require a companion, uh, for your excursion? Someone who could be of assistance? Ha ha ha ha ha! Assistance? Ha! How could you be of assistance? You're broke and seriously clueless. Well, on occasion, my father, uh, called upon me to assist with the tire-changing procedure. Oh, my god, brilliant! Mondo road warrior. Ha ha ha ha! Anything else? Yes. Uh, in the, uh, nontechnical sector, um, appraisal of the environment, wildlife identification, seasonal changes. Oh, wow, that must come in handy. You can tell whether it's raining or not, huh? Whoo-hoo! You must be great with roadkill. So you like driving? Yeah, me, too. Where's your ride? Oh, i--i don't get out much these days. And if I do, i--i use public transportation. What, the bus? Oh, bro. Please. Only wetbacks and insane people take the bus. Jesus. Ha ha ha ha ha. Well, don't you at least have any friends that have cars? I've, uh, been rather solitary lately. All right. So, what am I dropping you off at Baldwin Avenue or something? You ever been to palm Springs? One--once. [Sobbing] A long time ago-- time ago with my father. Grab me a beer, squid. We're gonna go catch US some quail. Really? Yeah. Fuck, yeah. We're on the road, baby. Here you go. Yeah, thank you. All right. High-five. It's the hand. No, hit my hand. Ah. Yeah! Ok. All right. Yeah, I thought you pulled a Rick. [Sighs] Where do you think he is? I don't know. You know. What about that girl, you know, ginger woodpecker? I think it's quail. I know her name. It's her stage name, Jack. I guarantee you her real name's like Theresa, ok, or Holly, or Laurie Ann. And her last name's probably kanker. Is she why last night happened? Look, it's--it's-- it's more than that. It's not just that. Just don't take it the wrong way, ok? Ok. How should I take it? Take it however you wanna take it. I mean, if last night meant something to you, that's great. It meant something to me. You know, Rick or no Rick. Are you being a bitch or--or just trying to sound like one? I'm sorry, Jack. Rick: Oh, you like to bowl? Jules: Yes, most definitely. I even used to own my own ball. It was cherry red. I came in second once in the junior tournament. Bet I could put some serious hurt on you. You know, defeat you? Dude, I just challenged you. I just said I could smoke your ass. Where's your competitive spirit, man? I'm not roadtripping with some squid that's afraid to bowl. Very well. I accept. Ha ha! You're going down. All right. What are the stakes? What are we playing for? I think I'd rather not gamble. [Chuckles] Tough shit, hombre. What do you got that's worth winning? I guess that wristwatch is gonna have to do, 'cause I'm not risking my awesome bowling reputation for some piece of shit. All right? I need valuables. I need loot. Well, I'm afraid I must ask. Uh, what about you? What are you going to gamble? [Shudders] What exactly is it? What is it? It's total bliss, squid. It's twister, you know? Spin the spinner, call the shots, twister ties you up in a knot? Man, it's sixties incarnate, brother. It's like, you know, it's a party game. Something you do with other people. My parents were never big proponents of that kind of diversion. Oh, my god, dude, are you telling me you've never played twister before? I mean, that's like stealing your dad's beer or pouring salt on snails. It's a crucial step in normal childhood development. I've, uh, I've never actually owned a pair of, uh, sunglasses. [Chuckles] My shades for your bogus wristwatch, dude? You're hurtin'. No way. Besides... Gear like this... [Sighs] It just--it just doesn't really work for hoedads like you. Well, i--i think that would be a fair exchange. Yes, I would accept those terms. Oh, you would, would you? Oh...big man. Big wow. Ok, you got yourself a challenge. Hoo! Psych. Be prepared for some serious butt-kicking, squid. All right, squid, time to pick a ball. What are you gonna roll with tonight, my man? Ha ha! You're going down.

Rick: Great gas stations, great bowling alleys. Great people. The people here are jerks. [Both laugh] So, how old are you? How old do you think? Uh, I don't know. 21? 16. 16? Heh heh. And you're hanging around the bowling alleys, flirtin' with random dudes? I'm not flirting. 16's kinda young, huh? What do you think? Like, not that young. Really? [Both laugh] You like my hat? It's kinda hot. It's my Hawaiian hat. Really? It gives me good luck when I'm bowling. You want to be my kahuna? So, where'd all your friends go? They went home. They go home when their parents tell them to. You're not that cute, you know. I can tell you think you're, like, super-cute or something. [Both laugh] What? I won. [Laughs] All right. And? The wager was for the sunglasses. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the sun-- ok, yeah. All right, squid. You won 'em fair and square. I don't want my new friend Tracy here to think that I'm some kind of a welcher.

Oh, let's call it a mugging. A mugging? Justice was had by all. Oh, well, that's good. I see you already got yourself a drink. Got a drink. Ah. You like my dress? It's black. Yeah, well, it's pretty, isn't it? A friend of mine picked it out for me. A friend? Yeah. This photographer I know. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I have a kir royale? Sure. Another Tequila? Yeah. Heh heh. I'll have a sauza hornitos, the one with the green label that tastes like gasoline. Hornitos it is. Ginger: Hornitos it is. Yeah, as in horny. Oh, yeah? How horny? Horny enough to shred that little triple-x pussy of yours. Mm. You know, it shreds back. It makes the bad boys beg. Well, here's to that beautiful little thing. Cheers, mate. [Laughs] I like that you came all the way out to the desert to see me. I didn't think you would do it. What, and miss our first date together? Is that what this is? Yeah, you know? When do I get to meet your parents? Ha. Parents. That's a laugh. Thank you.You're welcome. Well, the crucial thing is this is our first date. I'm nervous. You're nervous? Heh. So, how'd the shoot go? You know, it was all right. Except for one thing. We had to do this, um, shot. I had--was doing this scene with this really gross guy, and we were doing a shot where he practically climbs on my back. That's so the camera can get the action. For believability, right? Yeah, well, he's been around for a really long time. Practically forever. Only thing he has going for him is he's got a really big dick and he never misses a cue. A cue? Yeah, well, that's when the director wants him to come. He always comes right away. They call him ol' faithful. Ok. So, anyhow, me and Mr. Ol' faithful are doing the scene, and you know what he does? He climbs right up on my back and then he tries to stick his cock in my ass. I mean, I don't do that. You only do that if you're desperate. Not if you're the star. So, I told him off in front of everybody. I said, "you're just a life-support system for your cock." [Laughs] He thought it was a compliment. Ha ha ha ha ha! Mm. I'm gonna go freshen up. Would you order me another one of these? Yeah, sure. Wanna come with me? Oh, no. Wanna bump?No, thanks. You sure? No, you go ahead. Knock yourself out. All right. You could do better. Yeah? Much. That--that bitch! No, no. See, but that doesn't matter 'cause I'm into you. Ha ha ha. Oh, yeah. No, no. Ah ha ha. Crazy, man. Careful. Hey, where's your-- do you have a car or are we just gonna walk around the mountain? Oh, my thumbnail! She was sexy. She's got her own whole-- sexy? She knows-- sexy? She knows-- I'll give you sexy, you little-- she knows what it's all about. Come here. What? Come on. Ha ha ha ha ha! What? I'll help you. Here. Here what? Here. Come on. Mm. Mmmmm. Ahhh. You want to do it right now? Sure. All right. Ok. All right, sweetheart. Stick it in, baby. Stick it in. Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on, stick it in. Come on, honey. I'm losing my hard-on. Ha ha ha ha! You and your hard-on. I know. Come on. What are you-- what the fuck? What is this? What the fuck is that? Nothing. Do it right or don't do it at all, asshole. Ok? That's the safe thing. I don't want no fucking safe sex, ok? It's not romantic. I'm being respectful to you. Respectful? Fuck that. I hate condoms. They're not romantic. I'm clean. All right? You want it? Do you want it? Uh, yes. Yes. Ok. I just, you know, I mean, I just, you know-- oh, yeah. Ok. Wait. Yes. All right. Wait, hold on. Ginger: Ah...Ah...Ah... Hi, my name is Rick. I'm 6'2", 200 pounds. I like dry-fucking teenagers and catholic schoolgirls. [Ginger laughs] All right. Tell me a little about yourself, young man. I, uh, you know, I suppose I started working. Got a couple of, um, you know, I got a-- bullshit jobs, you know. That's fascinating. And did we start a family? [Laughs] No. No. We didn't start a family. So you don't have a sweetheart? There-- there was a girl. Was... Or is? Was. All right. Now, stand up and take off your pants. [Laughs] Rick. Come on. It's part of the game. Just come on-- just sit over-- just come here, sit down and have a beer. Come on. It's been fun, tiger. Run along home. Go play with your lego set. Ha ha. Hold on. Hold on. I wanna get this on camera. Action! All right. Ok. That's really good. Mmmmm. Ohh. [Gasps] Oh, my god, Rick. That is magnificent! Oh, no. Put your boots back on. Ooh, you are so sexy, Rick. You are turning me on. Ok, now. Caress yourself a little bit. Pull it out and stroke it. Turn yourself on for me. Come on. Come on. Let's make it get big and angry. Ooh. Ooh. Nice. Oh. Oh, nice. All right, now. Turn around slowly. Slowly. Show america what you've got. Oh, that's nice. Sit down. All right. Now I'll be the actress that's coming in. Hey, tiger. What have you got there? Is that for me? Mmmm. Ooooh. Mmmm. Feelin' mighty good. Mmmm. I love it. I love a man with a hard can of beer. And you say? What have we here? Mm. This feels really good. [Laughs] You're a natural, Rick. Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, wow. Rick, rise and shine. Damn. Let me sleep. Come on, Rick. Rise and shine. It's me. It's ginger. Hi. Hi. Hey... Where'd you get the green eyes? They're contacts. Everything about me isn't real, Rick. So anyhow, um... You kinda have to go. This, um, room is this producer guy's room, and he's coming out from L.A. today, and I don't think he'd be real happy to find you here. What? Is he your boyfriend or something? Sort of. Sort of my boyfriend, and he's sort of my boss. So, you better go. When you say "boss," you mean director or pimp? I had a really good time, Rick, but you have to go. I don't need to explain myself to you. Whatever. Ah. [Snaps] What? Oh. Was I staring? Sorry. I thought you were gonna come in here and fight with me, and then you just kinda spaced out. I don't fight, not with you, not with anybody. Don't come around here again, ok? I'll call you when I get back to L.A. I don't have a phone. You don't have a phone? Eh, ya know, come to think of it, I don't an apartment, either. Really? Well, um... How about... I'll give you my number. You can call me at-- [Sighs] No. Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. Forget what? Forget it. I can't see you again, all right? I probably shouldn't have even invited you here. [Sighs] [Sighs] I'm tired of men like you-- men who are boys, men who want to screw up my career. Your career? What career? You're a porn star. I mean, that's, like, bottom of the barrel, careerwise. Fuck you. At least I have a career. You know, I don't see how fucking me is going to screw up your career. I mean, isn't that like practice? Because... If I start fucking you, seriously... Well, that's different. [Sighs] I need things. I... [Sighs] I need to concentrate on my work and on my career. [Sighs] Well... I need things, too. I need a ride back to my car. It's at that bar. Well, aren't we independent? At least I don't call bein' a whore a career. A whore? A whore?! I'm a star, all right?! I'm a big star! Ok, fine. Whatever. Yeah, you are a star. Out! Get out! Get out! Get out, you stupid asshole! Get out! Go on! Move it! Move it! Move it! [Thinking] I find this all disconcerting. You consume this like a... A hummingbird consumes nectar. [Buzzing] Don't you get it, man? Come on. She's not like a fantasy. Real woman. I'm gonna go break some laws. Don't wait up for me. Drink some water. [Thinking] Do you know that some gulls... That are drawn to what threatens them... Drawn by, uh, the danger... It's a pattern that's repeated throughout nature. Maybe that's... Your enticement. Rick: Fuck you and your bird-shop whining! Ah! Uhh...Uhh... Oh... Ooh! Uhh... [Whipping] [Chuckling] [Whipping] [Ginger's voice on videotape] Aah! Uhh! Ginger, on video: Oh, my... What have we here? [Laughing] Fuck you, Jules. [Laughing] Uhh...heh heh! Oh... Uhh! Oh... Eh...oh... I thought you knew the rules, ginger. Ginger, on video: Oh! No pulling on the side. Now, if you wanna fuck someone other than me... Then I get paid for it, and I don't think that punk cowboy's payin' me, which means you just cheated on me and broke our deal. Which means... Aah! Uhh! I've gotta find a way to make up for that money, doesn't it? [Kissing] [Ginger, scared moaning] You're ok. [Ginger talking on video] [Ginger, painfully] Uh...Uh! Ahh... Puhhh! Monster predator. Robinson: Ok, guys, here we go. For you. For you. And for the man who hates anybody with a full head of hair, multi-edge electric. [Chuckling] How about a little shaving cream? Oh... [Whimpering] Honey? Oh! Oh! Shh! It's ok, baby. It's ok. Ginger! [Knocking] It's ok. [Knocking] Who wants to go first? [Crying] Who wants to go first? Ginger! Ginger! Ginger! Well... Well, if it isn't loverboy. I need to talk to ginger. Wait. Robinson: It's your boyfriend. Ginger: Oh, fuck! Robinson: He's drunk. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, robby. I don't. He's just some like-- shut up! [Whack] Get out there and get rid of him. All right. And don't come back here until he's gone. Ok, all right. I mean business. All right. All right. Go! What are you doing here? I thought I told you to get lost. You been in the shower? Yeah. Yeah. I have to get up early. Ginger, come on. Let's get outta here. What are you talking about? I'm not going anywhere. But you know what? You better leave, or you're gonna get hurt. Look, don't let those losers shave your head, ok? What? Let's just bail, all right? You stuck-up prick. You're calling me a whore, and you come crawling back here and peep in the window, and you didn't like the show. What's the matter, tiger? You didn't like my acting? Maybe you're just jealous, is that it? Maybe you want a little baby ginger that you can come and rescue? Well, fuck that! Fuck that! You better run along home, little boy, because I've got work to do! [Whispering] Ginger, ginger, ginger... Come with me. [Laughing] We'll just go, the two of US. The two of US. Let's just go now. You're a nice fuck, Rick, but if robby thought I was mixed up serious, you'd be in deep fucking shit, ok? Robby? Robby. Yes. My husband. Yeah, I'm already in a lot of trouble. I'm not gonna be able to sit down for a week. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Husband?! Yeah. But I... I thought your husband was in the Navy and in the Philippines. I lied. Does that surprise you? Yeah. Robby's my husband. He's not a husband. He's a pimp. A lot of actresses in my business, they-- they pull a little on the side. It's just another way to make ends meet. I'm sure you don't understand that. Ends? Like what ends? Like--like-- like champagne and fancy clothes and coke? Robby thinks I can be a great actress. Yeah. He believes in me. He's gonna help me make it in straight films. He believes in me. You are his meal ticket. He will tell you anything you wanna hear. He's just lyin' to you. And you wouldn't? I'll tell you anything you wanna hear. I'll lie to you all goddamn day if you want to. Let's just go. Let's just bail outta this place and blow off this fuckin' loser. Bail where? Where? I... Rick-- tell me you don't feel something. Tell me you don't wanna go with me, huh? Ginger... Look at me. Look at me, and tell me you don't wanna go with me. Huh? Come on. You can't, can ya? Tell me you don't wanna go with me. You know you feel somethin', too. You know you do. Please. Please, Rick. Please just leave now before you get hurt. I have to go back to work. I have to go now, ok? Just go away. Don't 'cause any more trouble. They're-- inside. You know what? Fuck you, dickhead. Uhh! Uhh! Ahh... Good job, baby. Ah... Uhh! [Cocks gun] Now... Take off his pants. Please, robby, just let him go. Take his pants off. Somebody put on ginger's favorite song. [I'm in youplays] There now. Fluff him, honey. Robby, please. I don't want to. Go on.

No doubt about it. We've been owning the fun. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! There weren't any Indians. What? What happened back there? There aren't any indigenous peoples wandering about, scalping people at will. Weren't you visiting a girl? I tried to get her to come back with US.

I want to show you... The castle of birds. The aviary that my father designed is a modern marvel. [Plunks down glass] Why not? This road trip's officially over. I can't even deal with it. Come on, Jules. Rick: How come you're so...Unique? Jules: Well, i'm, uh, simply a product of my, uh... Environment. My father... And mother... Owned the, uh, castle of birds. It was our family business. Ha! So what, you sold parrots and stuff? No, no. Our speciality was in raptors, birds of prey. I mean, to create a very nurturing environment for our...Residents... My father called them residents, but mother called them guests. Guests? Ha! Jesus. Occasionally, we were, uh... [Echoes] Were, uh... Contracted out by the Los Angeles zoo. [Echoes] Los Angeles zoo. In the care of finicky... [Echoes] Care of finicky... Avian cases... [Echoes] Avian cases... On one such occasion, uh... [Echoes] Such occasion... We were, um... Moving red tail... [Echoes] Moving red tail... That had been delivered to US... [Echoes] To US... For, uh, research... [Echoes] Research... In cyclic populations. The door should have closed automatically... ...automatically... But the latch must have failed. I--i--i-- I don't really know. [Wham] [Hawk shrieks] [Chirping] My father blamed me. [Echoes] My father blamed me... ...blamed me. Said... [Echoes] Said... I was... [Echoes] I was... Negligent. [Echoes] Negligent. [Wham] [Hawk shrieks] [Wings flapping][Chirping] That hawk was my responsibility. Relax. It's only a bird. It's a thing that... Flies around and drops shit on people. All right, one more or less bird in the world ain't gonna change civilization. That is precisely the attitude that my parents taught me to revile. All living creatures are connected, all part of the divine scheme. Humans must be a caretaker species. We must redefine our attitudes! [Bird calls] If we aren't careful we willdestroy our habitat! All right, dude. Jesus, the sky is falling. Man, you're breaking me. Goddamn. Sorry. Jules: You know what? I feel like driving. [Panting] I'd like to, uh, how do you say, take US for a spin? [Screech] Ok, look. Get your hand. Go-- whoa! Rick: Great. Uh... Can you handle? [Tires squeal][Both laugh] Whoa! Whoa! Your hand on 10:00 and 2:00 just like a clock. There you go. There you go. Take it easy. Whoa. Wha ha ha ha! Now, slow down a little bit. Whoa-ho ho! All right, you're a cowboy now. No wonder you were so bizarre. You can't live in the city of angels and not drive. [Chuckles] Hey, drive smooth. Smooth, ok? Smooth. Move over there. Stop light. Red means "stop," ok? Ok, hit the brake, the big fat one on the left. [Screech] Grab ahold. Grab--ok. Good. [Brakes squeal] Jules: I... This is, uh... This is-- they've, uh... Changed the entire, uh... The entire place is, uh... It's... It's--it's-- they've destroyed the entire facade of the building. It don't look so heinous. It's a sin, what they've done. They've ruined it. Uh, pardon me. Who's in charge here? Sir, welcome to pilatech's castle of birds. Um, this is tropical bird month. May I help you? You may assist me... By...getting me the manager, and I must point out that I am sure these are not all sustainable harvested birds. You're being requested at the front desk, please. There's a lot of birds, man. Rick: Lotta birds in here. Are you the manager? Yes, sir, I am. May I help you? I'd like to purchase this, please? He wanted you. Here you are. Uh... There you go, sir. Thank you for shopping castle of birds. To paraphrase drucker, there is nothing worse than doing the wrong thing well. Who? Peter drucker. He is at the forefront of rethinking business practices. You are selling a potentially faulty product. Due to your negligence, I could kill the birds. Did you warn me? Well-- this...sugar water-- if it's left unattended, it will ferment, and it can cause damage to the birds' livers. Did you warn me?! And would you have warned me that that damn seed can lead to poisonous mold?! Sir, if there aren't any other of our highly regarded products that I can help you with, I'll have to ask you to leave the store. Leave the store?! This store was my life! You philistine! You--you poacher! Jules, let's go to the car. Let's go the car, ok? Sorry, pal. My friend's had a hard road trip. He's just gettin' a little aggravated. Let's go to the car. Go to the car, Jules. Go to the car, ok? Just get in the car. Et tu, brute? Jules, you sold the place, fair-- Jules, you sold the place, fair and square. They paid you money for it. It's theirs now. Game over. Now, get in the car. This road trip's officially over. No! This road trip is not officially over until I go in there and I get that red tail hawk. That bird's legs will atrophy and it will die if it is left in that cage. It is time to get crucial! Oh, shit. Oh, come on. Aah! I want that red tail hawk, the one in the undersized cage. Have your assistant Mandy bring me some gloves, fit it with a hood, and crop it with some dead mice. Then bring her over here, now! But I don't know how to do that. I can only do this. I would take that up with management tomorrow. Just..get me some gloves and a hood... And bring the cage over here. Do not frighten the guest. The guest! The... The--the hawk! The hawk, you idiot! Hold it right there, fella. Been waitin' my whole life for a freak like you. You just give me a reason. Roll the guest out to the car, Jules. Do it now before I change my mind. The bird stays, or I'll shoot. Go ahead. Come on, man. Shoot! Do it! Got the balls, huh? Gonna blow me away over one lousy bird that you're gonna wind up killin' anyway? Jules, get the guest and get out to the car right now! That guy with the hawk... He's a f-- he's a friend of mine. His family built this store. He's been in the bird business since before he could walk. Now, he says you're hurtin' the bird, and I've road-tripped with this guy. If there's anyone in the galaxy that would know, it's him. So I say, if he wants the bird to go free, let the bird go free, ok? So come on, man. Shoot me. Whatever. Fine. Make up your mind, tough guy, but remember, you're gonna be doin' it with me unarmed and you shoot me in the back. I wonder what that's gonna look like on the police report.

I was just wondering... You have a... Back room here or anything? Because, uh... The kid here... Hasn't had sex with a girl in... Couple...
