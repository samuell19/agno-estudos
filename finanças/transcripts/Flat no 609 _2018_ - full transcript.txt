One minute... They know me... not Rono... If I say everything... will anyone believe... None will... Did you say your parents? It's not possible to say them... Already so many problems... Again if... What Arka is saying? Did you tell him anything? I told him but he ignored... You make him understand then definately he will... Listen... Tell... I'm calling you later... Coming... call you later... I can't wait for so long... Keep a bag outside... everyone use to do like this... Ok... I asked for 500 ruppees in advance... what about it... 500 ruppees for what?

You listen... Sometime she gets upset... You come to sleep... come... Come... Sin can't be covered... You bring Tony to yourself... Asked her many times... she didn't agree... It's sound like the ghost stories of childhood... It's not possible... Have you consulted a doctor for Tony... We can't force her to visit a doctor... And her husband is there to look after... I doubt on his sense of responsibility... Don't say like this... They did what they think good... I think it's a pshycological case... Ok, as you are saying... I will threaten the broker... Ok ...don't do anything extreme... Actually they are all under the shelter of politicians... So you can't do anything extreme... You don't worry... I'll find out the truth...

My daughter's dead body was rescued by the police... And Pupu? He was not found for the first two days... Then while searching Police found his body in the closet of the upper room...

Why will we come to a rented flat, when we have our own already That's true But as usual, he didn't listened to me Actually, I can't blame Anirban also... Because that flat is very near to his office Look, I don't know whether it is ghost or not... But we always felt the existence of another one Well, I mean... If you please tell me about the feeling At first, utensils were fallen... Then switched off the light autometically... At first I got those very natural But when Boon... I mean my son, who will be age of 7 years very soon... Suddenly he watched an unknown boy there He told that he will play with that boy He told me that the boy is standing by him... Hearing this, we felt very anxious... Then we left the flat Perhaps, some guests are in you flat Anyway, I saw a boy is standing on the window Tell him not to do so Otherwise I will be in trouble Bye... Hello, anybody here? Hello, anybody here? Anybody? My God... It's a blunder It is a 10 years old photograph And then also a face with beard Me also shall be looked like this if I make up A better one can't be found? No Sir, this is the only one... Okay... you do one thing, go to our graphic designer What is his name... Chitta... yes, Chitta... Ask him to make an image without beard... Will it be anything different? Then also, we can guess then... Have you seen? Pupu drew very well Mountain Birds This one He showed me after completing these drawings... He was with his parent He must show me No more... But, I didn't see this picture Who are they? These are new paintings When have you got those? Yesterday But there is nothing written which you have told... I also didn't see from the morning I am not feeling well Pupu is in this room What do you want to say? What? I won't tell anyone... Tell... I won't tell anything Tell me... Tony... Tony... Tony, are you in the room? Tony, I have rang the bell, but why didn't you open the door? Why are you sitting here? Tony... What happened? What happened to you? Why are you doing so? I know everything Tony, we will discuss about this... Can you tell me, why does the baby do so? Why does he do so? I know that... I know that... I know... Hello, Dr. Das? I am Arko calling I am bringing Tony to your chamber Just look at this What I suspect Now sedative is on... Let her sleep for sometime better you to go home You see her in the evening I have some queries Okay, come inside Look at this Sir... This is not a current issue It is a very old case It was started from 2002 Here are some incidents Everyone is linked We have shifted in a new flat Sayantani was telling that... Abnormal or paranormal? Well, Tony is telling so... In this type of case, psychological stress... Doctor... I didn't stress her by any means... In fact, I asked her to come to you and counsel herself Anyway, now it is useless Let her be under sedation... under supervision... Then we will decide what to do... Then also, how long it will take to cure? That's can't be told exactly, because this kind of patient is unpredictable May it be One month or Six months... Sir, your assumption was right... The face is same without the beard With a musk of good citizen, he is doing fraudulent activities, year after years And we are not able to catch him... In 2002, his name was Anirban Lahiri... he cheated a widow residing at Durgapur... In 2009, place was Siliguri, now his name was Mainak Chanda In this time his victim was a teenage model Her father was a billionaire... Very good... He married him for two months... Her father fixed it with a good amount of money To rescue his daughter... A mechanical Engineer, an employee of a good company... Then why he use to do this... They are pshycologicaly totally different.. Maintain a high social status... Can't make friendship with general people... May be disturbed for any childhood reason... He is also alike... Grown up in uncle's house... Father commited suicide as his mother left his father... Yes Amlan tell... What? Ok... I will see... What happened sir? You should knock before entering... I got afraid... What you fear so much? Get caught... Don't talk rubbish... What's the situation there? Well there... My story ended there... Listen, today will do the fund transfer... No need to delay... Did you do the account setup? I don't keep these works pending... Well, did anyone see you coming here... If saw then what... Officially, I have not done any crime... No records till today... Police didn't get any trace of you till now... No trace left to catch... Tell me one thing... Did anything really happen in that flat... I don't belief... But Pappu told me before that there is a strong rumour... People over there believe that... And in that situation if Tony starts enquiring from others about the fact... Then her stress will increase... Then the maid will deny to come at night out of fear... Suddenly, the lift will stop... Every time Pappu was there to support... I also didn't imagine of so quick impact... Well... Didn't have to deal much... all smooth... Matter of crores... you understand that... Everything is within it... Without princess... the whole kingdom is ours... Bye... I'm taking the bike, leaving the car here... You told to stay aware... Yes Sir, he is out... I think he understood... Playing with us... Let him play... and you also play... Ask the next traffic squad to block the bike... Can I know my fault? I wanted to call you... But you rided so first that... You got scared by seeing them? Anyone will scare seeing the police... Who wish to be in trouble? Want to say something? I have two questions to you... First question has three parts... Where were you on 15th july of 2005, 3rd march of 2008 and 5th september of 2011... It's not possible to remember for a normal human being... Do you exactly remember, what you did on those days... Then moving to my second question... Look at this photo... can you recognize him... He is my replica... Criminal or what? Be careful... I will Sir, thank you... Can I ask you onething? Hmm... sure... Why you made such a scene on road with bike, car... You could have call me on police station... Yes I could... Would that have good, if they put you behind the cell and have beaten you... After all you are a good citizen... I also have some moral duties... Let him go... I need to talk to you... Did your daughter complain against me? No not that, but the whole matter seems very strange to me... A complete fit girl... Complete fit... It didn't happen before? You want to say that bi-polar is not a disease... No, it's not a disease... Many have this problem... Who created this situation? I did... I imported a ghost in this flat... Happy... Listen, it's already too late... Your daughter is not here, so I have to cook... Will you have your dinner here? Look madam, we know everything... So we are not willing to disturb you unnecessary... So why you called me here without any reason? Not without reason... There is a reason... Your death is on both side... This side he and the other side me... Now the question is what type of death do you want? Slowly or... You are threatening me... You will get one... Then the whole world will see your actual face... Then you will become a celebrity... Sir, Jayanta informed that the boy went to an ATM... And there he had a problem... But now he returned home... You keep on watching that side... Ok, you call the force... Two will be enough and also take the S.I with you... I'm going to the control room... So much insecurity that you brought the gun with you... Sir, look at monitor 1... why you created this suspense unnecessarily... Did your pressure increase... Don't waste time... Why you opened my bank account? None knows the information except you... Your bank account? When it became your? I was calling you... why didn't you receive? Police caught me... Imprisoned me for two hours... Annanya, you arre my accomplish... I didn't expect such a bad story from you... Bad story? Good about your luck that I didn't say anything... What do you say? Then you had to say from the begining... You introduced me with Sayantani... That means, you want to be good now... So you don't want profit share... The whole money is mine... I don't want to talk... Just want to know, where is the money... Asking you for the last time, where is the money... Again another bad story... The whole room is under cctv surveillance... Everywhere camera fitted... What are you doing? Annanya leave... Annanya you are... She didn't take the money... Why you shoot her? You... you... How you did such a big drama of love? Have you never loved anyone in your life? Arka Mukherjee... a very cool headed criminal... Always targeted lonely girls... Do a good job... Naturally, no one suspected him... In last ten years made three such incidents... My daughter didn't give me any scope to check his background... Before that... No..no... She has no fault... Police got confused too... After five years again he re-appeared This time his target was Sayantani... Who can be mold easily... Easily trapped with love... As usual no court marriage done... Married in temple which have no legal validity... He ruined the wedding pictures... Where are our wedding pictures? Tomorrow I'm leaving, can't search now... Hacked my banking information from my laptop... Tell me your password... I didn't understand anything at first... It didn't even come to my mind... It's natural... And after that joint account in bank, locker... Have to open the bank account after returnig... it's urgent... Why you need to open a new account... I have my account... join with it... When you started doubting him? You didn't know about the ghost? Your husband knew everything... He didn't say you anything? After uncle told me... I started enquiring everywhere... Went to his office to do enquiry... Went to old tenant's house... Then met with you at lalbazar... Everthing becomes clear to me... Very clever... He managed Pappu to get that flat... And according to Pappu... I told Mr.Arka, that flat is haunted... He told that he wants that... Told that, will pay more, so I... What would I do if he want? One depressed lady... It's easy to stress her by showing fear of ghost... And if Sayantani is proved mad... Then nobody will doubt on Arka... I started acting... Arka was fooled by that... Doctor uncle helped a lot... The drama of admitting in hospital... confused Arka more... someone was warning me from the begining... Was giving me clue one after another... Pictures of old victims... Sketch of Arka... Forged flight tickets of Arka's tour... Repeatedly pointing towards Arka... Telling me to run away... One was giving all types of signals... Who is that? Let it go... Many things exist in this world which has no explanation... But that doesn't mean, it is not true Bye Ani... Let's go... Where will I go... I have no home... Will you drop me... Uncle... You... you were... I will tell everything uncle... But why you are still awake? I felt asleep... Suddenly I awoke with a bad dream... What dream? I saw Pupu, sitting on his mother lap on varandah... I wanted to call... then.. Then... No... I will tell you later... Youn go and take rest... I have a good news... After a long time, your aunty fell asleep without sleeping pills... Good... very good... You too sleep... Some words remain unsaid... To stare with lonely eyes... Kept to tell you... Memories comes in form of stories... My story starts and ends with you... Only you can make me flooded... Kept to tell you... Memories comes in form of stories... Kept only to tell you... Memories comes in form of stories...
