second assistant accountant at the bank in silver city and yesterday hey sheriff what are you doing posters out of date they got him yesterday who was a lucky guy a bounty killer from dodge city so i said to myself i'll go to cousin frank he's sure to have a hundred dollars he can advance me as dividends on my shares in our company frank what do you say ah me shares i don't know what you're talking about i sent you all my savings remember mine and jane's to sink into your gold mines and your railroads huh hi has the trouble is you sent me your funds to sink and all the railroad bridges fell down and the mines caved in and they sank without a trace but don't you worry we came out of this business pretty well ah so you mean we're okay that's a big relief yes we have understand but we don't know anyone a bean how's that that's a fat lot of good we haven't got look you've got to have heart your friend frank has plenty of irons in the fire and plenty of bright ideas let's have a look at you you know the costume couldn't be better well i'm afraid the poncho doesn't suit my figure and the material's not too good still it's perfect for what i have in mind i tell you we'll be rolling in money so really anyone seen you yet i don't think so marvelous this is my plan yeah we arrange a couple of easy robberies thanks a lot it's been nice knowing you hey wait you haven't let me finish there'll be only phony robberies no risks attached just enough to make them put a price on your head do what yes and when the reward is a sum that's worth having i'll pretend to track you down and hand you over to the sheriff just forget it wait to have her the best part the sheriff will put you in jail and then i'll collect the reward so long and don't write me i'll write you but i haven't finished after that of course i help you get away and then we split the bounty money and no one is any the wiser frank i think that's terrible huh i'd never dream of such a swindle man [Music] you can start by stealing those horses horses horses but they're too big why don't you let me begin with something a little bit smaller like ducks or chickens huh frank huh you've got to steal something important what about the owner he might be cross oh the old ninja boop's quite harmless huh well anyway i'm going to put on my disguise that's your pistol bill your face must be visible oh now the charu no i don't want it it makes me sick go on but suppose it makes a noise supposed to make a noise [Music] pull the trigger pull it [Music] say if i was you yes if you was me i put down that pistol son oh but if that's what's worrying you of course and now we'll have a little chat go on get inside oh no i wouldn't disturb you i just stopped looking at a nice view get inside yes sir do you told go on before i lose my temper i'll still show you who i am your young farmers thought you'd get away with it eh no but clarity john's no fool so there i once knew of a calamity jane by chance a relation yes a distant cousin oh yeah the further the better but she ain't the only one can use a gun oh no i'll just show you oh bravo bravo granddad do you see all those they were once the most desperate desperados in the whole wild west and i knocked them off one by one and now with all the bounty money i can live nice and comfy for the rest of my days and my friend said you were an old i'm very impressed really and i'll bet you live to be a thousand drop that gun or your dead as a door frank and tie yourself will i keep the old man covered right so long granddad you keep your hands up

hands up that'll fix him come on keep him up come on [Music] goodbye catherine we see it [Music] uh how much a hundred dollars not bad for a beginner wait and see there's a girl over there all alone now's your chance to go and frighten her oh why do you expect me to frighten her you put up a show of strength she's stronger than we are look you've got to drag her inside and force her to hand over the cash frank i'm not used to doing this sort of thing you want to keep your job in the bank yes then get on with it make sure she remembers your face come here the cigar no no i don't let go on enough to make your spit [Music] you lie down my ankle my ankle would die i may know you're little pressure has he got to pain don't worry i know the perfectest way to cure it all oh you're feeling better no no oh well yes yes but the treatment has to be repeated good work bill keeper abstracted while i abstract this material one minute frank who's talking about abstractions there's nothing abstract about this [Music] if your mother could see you now [Music] it's an insult two armed robberies but only a poultry 500 reward but all i'm after is 100 it's more than enough to settle the account pretty generous aren't you after all i've done to help you out all you can think of is your miserable hundred dollars but i'm going to give you the other 400. what's 400 worth these days we must go straight for the dead or alive but what it's the only one that pays thanks very much but i don't want to die but you wouldn't really have to die ah you mean i only have to pretend to die that's right just to jack up the reward a few thousand dollars oh a bank oh where no no it's just an idea i've had that's what we need a bank to rob a robbery to give us publicity a robbery yes an armed robbery yeah in a bank yes with a cigar yes no no the cigar makes me cough as i was saying i keep a lookout and you go inside but wouldn't it be better for me to stay out here i don't feel the poncho's quite right for inside the bank but out here i'm just part of the scenery go on it's all yours all right here we are hey what do you [Music] think next smoking is a habit i don't tolerate but

seen it the way they refuse to control prices is preposterous nothing more than an amateur the guy isn't worth another cent how do you like that so they reduced it an amateur is right you bungled everything you start by robbing a corral and surrender the sight of an old fogey you can't blame me for that you told me he was fighting a firearms didn't you you planned her ordered a senseless widow but end up just making love to her oh but she was like an amazon i tell you so then you plan to rob a bank and come out with only four dollars yes but the others were fakes you know what we need what do we need a touch of carnage ah i suppose you mean murder sure 1920. so that's all settled you go off to kansas city and you don't come back for at least two weeks i understand so that's all settled
