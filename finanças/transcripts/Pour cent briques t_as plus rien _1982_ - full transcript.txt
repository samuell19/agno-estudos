CENTRAL BANK So? Nothing for an hour or two… Is that Bouvard? Yes. Intimidating, isn't he? I will need the broadcast to start very soon. Get ready. Do you have the turbos? We need twice as much. What a pain, with their budget! Put the bank on. Yes? Here is the police chief. Bouvard here. I will bring you the money and the car myself. Don't attempt anything, Bouvard. You'd be responsible for a massacre. You have my word. Got anything to say? Calling all cars… Calling all cars… Use radio channel 17. I want the spotlights on the CX at all times. Especially when it starts. Okay? Quick, begin the broadcast! Stop, Bouvard! Go back 15 feet. Drop the bags. Move. Stop. Chaubourg, the dough. As soon as the car starts, duck. Don't try to have us followed. Okay, Bouvard? Come on. On the ground! On the ground! Move! You, there. Duck! Bouvard! Come on, it's over, nothing to see here! Say, 500,000! How long did it last? Around ten hours. 50,000 Francs per hour. Tax-free. Wait, let me guess! It was roast pork! You know what time it is? Not again… Paul, I can see you. Don't sulk! I'm not sulking! I work all day! I'm hungry. Are you judging me for not working? Not at all… It's not my fault. Is it mine? Okay, I'm leaving. I am leaving! And don't try to make me stay! Paul! Dinner is ready. ONGOING BOTHER I never ate anything like this. You don't want it? You can look, but don't touch it. If you came home on time, it wouldn't have burned and you'd have seen the hostages on TV better. Okay, we can see the details better, but you don't get the atmosphere. It's like rugby, we get what's happening. 500,000 Francs, no sweat. And merry Christmas everyone! They will get caught. Want to bet? Of course, they'll spend Christmas in jail! Want to bet? I bet everything I have… until the end of the year. 15 francs 20. You're on. Want to share? Yes. Is this your concept of society? Welcome. We have news about the hostage taking in Avenue Junot. Our special correspondent in Paris will tell you more about it. Alain, could you tell us where you currently are? I am in Porte-Dauphine. A few minutes ago, the two hostages were freed by the fugitives. One of these hostages is by my side, Ms Nicole Chaubourg. So, the torment is over? How did this release go? We drove around Paris for an hour. Then, they stopped here. They got out and took the metro. Brilliant. Ten hours, that is a very long time. How were they with you? They were a bit nervous, but very nice. And how is it going for the police? We lost them for now, but in a few hours… -So they vanished into thin air. -I didn't say that. There we go, that's it. What a pain, these guys. They stole 500,000 Francs and now I'm penniless. You're expecting someone? No. That's someone we owe money to… I'll let you take care of it, you're the best for that. Hello. You said I could come whenever I wanted, so I came. Who is that? That's Paul. But he was leaving, right? What? -You were leaving, right? -Well… You were. Right… I was about to go for a walk. How long did I say I was going to walk? You said two hours. Two hours. Cheers… Hi, girls! I am free next week. Not me. What a pity, right? You and I will be a thing one day, for sure. See you later. All good, my boy? You will carry the tools, as you are the intern. Hurry up, I would like to finish this job today. LOCK SAFETY SERVICES Ginette… Your breakfast… Yes, it's Paul. I made you breakfast. In the 14th arrondissement, people stay calm just like police chief Bouvard and the two men who have been holding a dozen hostages for an hour in a bank on Avenue du Général Leclerc. To be continued! They are on a roll, lately! You saw the news yesterday? Yeah… Are you sulking? Stupid Sam. He thought they would get caught. He's so stupid. Could you take care of it? That's surely for Sam. Hello, miss. Is Mr. Lecat here? -Paul! -Yes? It's for Sam! What is it? A certified letter from the electricity company! Should I sign it? Have you seen this work? Five anchor points, sound alert… It's completely armored. Indestructible. You don't know my ex. He's a true King Kong. He would need to use a bulldozer, and even then… Étienne… Instant demonstration. Lock everything. He is twice as tall and strong as you! Got it! Are you ready? -It's locked! -Good. Watch out! Five, four, three, two, one, go! Perfect. I told you. It's professional work. It was hard with the boss, but it's done. I can leave for Seychelles on the 16th. Too bad. I will be in Oslo on the 16th. I've been waiting for six months, I can wait a bit longer. Bye, girls! See you later! LOCK SAFETY SERVICES Mission accomplished. Here is the copy of the purchase order. Yes… The copy of the receipt… and the check. Are you happy with your intern? Yes, he now knows everything about the job. Well, perfect. See you tomorrow. Thanks for everything. Étienne! Étienne, I'm glad. Your boss told me great things about you. As of tomorrow, you'll take his place and he'll be fired. What do we say? Thanks, dad! Why didn't I kick his teeth in? Because he is taller than you. Here we go: another unemployed person. Welcome to the club. There will soon be three million of us. Right, laugh. Come on, with your job, you will find something soon! If that's Ginette, I'm leaving right now… Right? -Mr. Samuel Lecat? -Yes? You know your creditors… There are so many, I preferred to gather everything and disturb you just once. Here. Gentlemen… What will we do without the TV? LOCKS - ARMOR PLATING - REPAIRS What will we do now? What everybody does: read the classified ads. POLITICS, AN ACT -How much? -Thirty-four. Really… Wait… You're completely out? Well, I will take less, then. I will take one Libé. How much is that, with L'Express? 12,50. Perfect. There we go. Sorry, Mr. Lecat. I dropped a check four days ago. It was a quarter of your overdraft. I am only asking for 300 francs. I have instructions, Mr. Lecat… I've been a client for five years. Mr. Lecat, banks are companies just like the others. They need to survive. They can't, with clients like you. How do I survive? Another man who robs a bank! Well done! If all the banks could be robbed, it would be great! "Looking for a supermarket manager, 10,000 square meters. "The ideal candidate would have practical experience and people skills. "He must be able to handle a meticulous computerized management. "He must be geographically mobile. "Salary: 400,000 Francs." Are we geographically mobile? -Not really. -No? "Midi-Pyrénées. Young Communard farmer looking for someone nice "to help with the work on his little farm. "Chicks welcome." That's not for us. There's nothing today… There is Commercial Manager, Civil Engineer, Waters and Forests, doctor, lawyer, 20,000… 30,000… 40,000… Nothing for minimum wage? Nothing under 1,000. You know how much a nice condo costs? I don't know… 100,000 Francs? Right! You get nothing for 100,000 Francs, now. A nice condo costs 300,000 Francs. So 1,000 Francs a month isn't much. Still… A condo that costs 300,000… 300 months of work. One forth of a century. If a guy starts working at 25, he gets a condo at 50. If he saves every cent for a quarter of a century, without eating, going out, nothing. Some people manage. Hats off… Well, crap… They have electricity. It's only us. I'll call the janitor. It can't be! They shut everything off! Crap! Where are you going? I'll shower before they shut it off. I knew it. I'm sorry? I knew something happened. It's the first time in six months you didn't stop by the office. May I come in? There's a blackout. Is it that disturbing? No. Two round trips to Port-en-Bessin this weekend. What do you think? I don't know. I would need to study the file. You better start now. I could have left if I'd known! I came to get some news. This is Paul, a friend who's visiting. Yes, for real! Let me get dressed and I will leave. Don't bother. See you tomorrow. Caroline! I'd like to dine at your place tonight. I like how shy you are. At nine? Okay, I will be there. Number 31, the street after the office. If it weren't for you… Come on, you're going at nine. Eight thirty. You said nine. When you go to a girl's home, go thirty minutes early. She won't be ready. She will be in the shower or getting dressed… Anyway, she will be half naked. It's time saving. What's the time? About Port-En-Bessin… I am not ready. You are now. I'll be right back. Why don't you watch a movie? Hands up! This is a hold-up! 500,000 divided into small bundles. You have one hour. After that, I will kill one hostage every fifteen minutes. Move. Wait… Or we could go to Étretat this weekend. You decide. I decide? Okay. You, this way. Come! If you knew… But I know. -Where are you going? -Be right back. I never felt this way, you know… -Sam… -Yes? I would like to live with you. Hands up! This is a hold-up! What are you doing? Take a pencil and write it down. Two balaclavas, two sub-machine guns, two revolvers, two grenades… Stop messing around. Take a pencil and write it down. What a pain, do you know what time it is? Take this, go to sleep. Two balaclavas… Two sub-machine guns… Two revolvers, two grenades… Where will you find all that? Here. Not very warm today, right? Indeed, one could even say it's cold. Can I get you a hot toddy? 250 billion! What, 250 billion? Each year, we spend 250 billion cents to buy Christmas gifts. We shouldn't. Come. Come here. Not only is it a perfect imitation, but on top of that, listen… I'll take three. I have three children. Isn't your girlfriend exploiting us? Listen, we are fed, accommodated, banged… Sorry, but I am only fed and accommodated. It burned a bit… Don't move. That's great. Is it complicated? No, there is no focus. It's automatic, you just push the button. Not bad. Let me see. -You're coming too. -No! Well, all right. -Don't say I didn't warn you! -No! Hurry up, let's go scouting. REGIONAL RETAIL BANK It looks nice, no? -You think? -Yes. Come on. PARIS SPANISH BANK CENTRAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS I don't know why, but I know this is the one. Come on. Go and check behind the door. I'm sorry? In the movie, the bank has only one exit. Go and check behind this door. Sorry… It's an office. Is there a window? I didn't check. It's me again. -No window. -Perfect. Is there one here? That's the restroom. Go and check for a window. Fine… -Okay, no window. -Perfect. Then that's it. I will take a few pictures. Take a look at the staff. -So? -There are only three of them. An employee, a cashier and a manager in the office. Sorry. -No problem. -Sorry. 23 feet. 26 feet… And 30 feet… Can I help you? How funny, I was about to ask you the same question. It's okay, it's his back. He has a nerve that… Yes, I don't like to talk about it… I have a nerve that often gets stuck. To loosen it up, I have to take long steps. It eases the pain. I feel a lot better now. It isn't much, but how painful can it be! Yes, I know that. I get awful migraines, sometimes. -Really? -Awful. My mother does, too. It hurts right here. And it tightens like a vise. For me, it's the neck. It goes all the way up behind my eyes. It's throbbing, right? It is throbbing. It worries me a bit. Anyway, can I help you? We came for an ownership saving scheme. Come in. I would rather take a look at home, quietly, and come back to you by the end of the week. Okay, but be careful, we close at noon the day before Christmas. That's fine. We will come back in the late morning. See you on the 24th. Hands up! -Close the door. -What? I don't understand? Close the door, for God's sake! Well, articulate! The grenade is too cumbersome after all. The sub-machine gun and the gun are impressive enough. You're right. Again. You know it can blow up! That's a toy, remember? We know that, but they don't. Come on. So? You go in first, shouting: "Hands up." I go in first? Go ahead. -Go ahead. -I'm going. Hands up! I told you to shout! Hands up! Go! Hands up! -That was good. -Don't panic, that's a hold-up! Why do you say "Don't panic"? So they won't be scared. If they faint, we will be in trouble. Then we can't say "Hands up" either. It will make them panic. In the movie, they say the worst enemy of hostage-takers is the panic of the hostages. You're right. They even brought sedatives with them. -Mister janitor. -What's going on? Men… -What? -Upstairs! Hands up, this is a hold-up! Close the door and stay in front of it. It's not so hard, is it? Again, come on! Are you insane? What now? You left the keys inside! Well… You're a locksmith, no? Hands up! Yeah, right… Incredible. The only difference is the weight. And the sound, too. What show will you be in? It's for Chambre Syndicale des Serruriers. For Christmas. Right, for Christmas. Really? Could you rehearse again so I can watch for a bit? Yes? Hands up, this is a hold-up! No… I'm sorry, but if you hold your sub-machine guns like this, it looks completely bogus. Look, on a sub-machine gun… The trigger is here, not here. -Right. -Got it? Like this, and then… Go ahead. There we go! Now it's credible. -You? -I'm good. Go ahead. Perfect. Okay, I have to go. If you need any technical details, I will be downstairs. You should burnish them a bit. They look too new. Don't panic, this is a hold-up! But won't the word "hold-up" make them panic? Don't panic! But now, they will wonder why I say "Don't panic." Well, because it's a hold-up. How can they know if we don't say it? They aren't stupid. They'll see our weapons. Exactly. I would be scared. So we hide them. Let's see how that would look like. Go ahead. -Don't panic! -The door. Crap! -Go ahead. -Don't panic. What did you say? I didn't hear anything. Don't panic! Well, say that to the hostages. I can't picture them. Can you? Yes, I can. Here is the counter. In front of it, six clients are turning their back on you. Behind the counter, facing you, the cashier and the employee. Go ahead. I'm trying, but all I see are chairs. I'll demonstrate for you. I can picture them better now. You take a relaxed posture. A bit nonchalant, like Redford in Butch Cassidy. I haven't seen it. Then just watch me. Don't panic. Got it? Come on. Don't panic. Now, jump on the counter. -Jump? -Yes! Face the wall, don't panic! What's going on here? Caroline, I can explain. You and your friend, out! It's for a show. Get out of here, now! It's fine, we can stay. I'll watch them, get the manager. Okay. Go! With the others! And don't even try to fight! Now, like in the movie, we wait for clients to try and come in. They will be surprised to find a locked door and will call the cops. Why wait? We empty the checkout and leave. Do you know how much cash they have in such a small bank? 15 or 20,000 bucks! I won't spend 15 or 20 years in jail for a tip. -No. -Right. We take hostages and demand a ransom, like in the movie. How much? 750,000. The others always ask for 500. Well, I want 750,000 Francs. Well. Wait, let it ring for a bit. Hello? Yes? Sorry, I didn't get your name. Police chief who? What is this now? Basic psychology. He is already asking for something. So what do I do? I crush him. What are you doing? If they come from the back, then we're screwed! Right, sorry. Hands up! It's a costly mistake. Don't panic! Hands up! Now we're going to jail for 20 years! Face the wall I said! Never mind. You can put your hands down. Never mind. Let's forget the whole thing. You're too crazy. Do what you want. I'm still doing it. Hands up! You want to do this alone? And don't you dare come to me when I'm done! I won't give you a cent! Go. PARIS RETAIL BANK Awesome! Where did you buy it? Is it a Lindberg or a LS? Hands up! And don't panic! Don't worry, I'm here. Silence! Silence! I will neutralize him. Hands up. Be ready to lay on the ground. -Face the counter! -Yeah, right. Go back, face the counter! Crap. Who is this guy? A former bodyguard of the presidential residence. Let's not panic. Let's do everything he says and it will be fine. Are you okay? Sorry, it's the nerves. That's normal. Do you need some Valium? Don't move! Don't panic. Face the counter, I said. Okay. It would be nice if you could close the door, we're dying here. Do it yourself if you're so smart. Go! And no tricks! Or I will shoot someone! Calm down. Don't. Should I get the manager in his office? All right, but quickly. If we do what he says, it will be fine. Come in. Get out. Really? What's going on? A hostage taking. I see… Okay. A hostage taking, right? Don't panic, this is a hold-up! I'm not kidding! Hands up! Silence! He isn't easy-going. Face the wall with the others! Hurry, he could shoot. May I suggest something? Yes? Take the money from the drawers and leave. We won't try anything, I promise. How much is there? 17,500 Francs. Divided into small bundles? No! I wouldn't take a risk for 17,000 bucks! Come sweetie, let's get some cash. Silence! What did I do with my checkbook? It can't be. I took the wrong bag. Daddy is right! How so? You're forgetful! Marie, now is not the time. Crap! What is that? Toilet flush. What is he doing? Washing his hands. Oh. Should I go with the others? Well… Yes. This is a hold-up. I'm not kidding. Don't panic. And don't try to fight. There is no risk with me. Hello, how are you? How long ago did it start? Are you hurt? -No, that was my pen. -Good. Did he shoot this guy? Please, keep quiet. Sorry, I am late. I need to know what happened. It's a hostage taking. I got that. But I mean, is it going well? Is he panicking too much? No. It's only the bodyguard who fainted. Is he part of the commandos? Is it political? No, he is a hostage, just like you. I mean, us. I don't get it. Where is his accomplice? What accomplice? There is always an accomplice. Really? Hostage takers are like bikers, they always come in pairs. I'm sure it's him. He pretended to faint, but actually… No. No way. How do you know? Face the counter, quick! Excuse me… With the others. Quick. What did I say? How much did he ask for? He hasn't asked for anything yet. We're not out of the woods yet. Did we call the cops? No. What? I have so much to do today! Sorry, but why not call the police? What are you waiting for? For someone outside to notice something is going on and to call them. Are you kidding me? What time is it? 11:55 a.m. You're closing at noon today? Yes. Can you imagine? Tomorrow is Christmas and we'll have to wait until Monday. If you don't want to get stuck here, call the cops right now. We'll save time, I have things to do. We could just trigger the alarm. The alarm… Are you crazy? The alarm will warn the area's police station. They won't be here for 25 minutes, at least. The police chief can't do anything, so he will call Quai des Orfèvres. If we call the minister directly, that should save us four hours. I'm only thinking of you. I know what you're doing is exhausting for the nerves. If I may, I agree with her. I must pick up my children from my sister's at 12:30. I have a lunch that I absolutely can't cancel. Okay, but I don't know the ministry's phone number. It's fine, I know the manager of the minister's office. I will call him and hand you the phone. Is he your friend? Yes and no… I see him quite often lately. I saw him recently when I was a hostage in Rue Madame. Really? I often visit branches. He is a charming man. I met him a few years ago in the Breteuil hostage taking. -So it was you on the news, the other day? -Yes. You're really unlucky. The hazards of the trade. What is your job? Being a hostage! I create ads for banks. Should I call him? Yes, call him. Give me a minute! Don't worry, I am used to it. It will be fine. All right. Do it quick and no tricks or I will shoot someone. Relax, buddy. Could I get the phone, please? Jean-Louis? This is he. -Hello, it's Nicole. -Hello. -How are you? -Good and you? Good, thank you. How is Sylvie? She's doing great. -When is it due? -March 25th. It will be an Aries, then. That's great! Are you happy? -Very happy. -Anyway, I wasn't calling you about that. Guess what. Don't tell me you are being held hostage again… Well, that's right. Are you joking? Jean-Louis, I swear this isn't a joke! Where are you? Paris Retail Bank, Place Charcot. -How many are you? -There are… -There are six hostages. -Is it tough? No, it's much nicer than in Rue Madame. Really, it doesn't compare. -And him? -He is alone. -He must have an accomplice. -That's what I thought too. -Do you know what he wants? -I don't know. I'll put him on. See you later. Thank you. I demand… I demand! I demand 500,000 Francs, divided into small bundles. New Francs? No, old. I won't swindle. Right, that would be 5 million now. Whatever. But you have one hour! Then I'll shoot a hostage every 15 minutes. The car… Right, I forgot! I also want a car! Automatic, if you have. But hurry up! I will start shooting hostages in an hour! That wasn't much. You should have asked for more! Like 750,000 Francs! That's true, I would have asked for more. -Me too. -See? 500,000 Francs… That's a formal reception in the Élysée. Right, sir? Indeed. The more you ask for, the more seriously they take you. Of course! Why didn't you ask for 750,000 Francs? I don't know. I wanted to ask for that much, and then… I didn't dare. He didn't dare. He is so dumb! They must think you're so dumb! -Shut up or I'll shoot you! -Gentlemen, please. -Moron. -You're unemployed. Clown. I'm sorry. But such stupid things make me sick. Sick! Off you go! Face the counter! We'll do this later. Yes, I know. I'll go with the others. I don't know what's wrong with me. I must have eaten something bad. Odette, please… Sorry, sir. It's the nerves. After the matter in Avenue du Général Leclerc, I publicly declared we wouldn't yield, so we won't. Keep me updated. Yes, mister secretary. They will call any second. Should I answer? Hello? Jean-Louis? Yes, it's me. Okay, I will tell him. Thank you anyway. Well? Bad news. LOCKSMITH This is police chief Bouvard. We won't give you a cent. You have five minutes to free the hostages and give in. If you don't, you will be responsible for a bloodbath. You have five minutes. I'm starting the countdown! He can't do that. Please, do what they say. They didn't take you seriously. 500,000! Why not 10,000 Francs while we're at it… What a moron! Let's not talk about it forever. Maybe not forever, but 15 or 20 years for sure! Four minutes! You don't really have a choice. Give in or else… -Or else? -Kill a hostage. What's wrong with you? It will impress them. That's stupid! Don't listen to her! Shut up or I start with you. Three minutes! He is counting fast. What will you do? Hurry up! So? I will kill a hostage. Shoot him, it won't hurt. No, never shoot a man when he's down. Why don't you volunteer? For God's sake! It was your idea, no? I… volunteer. You are such a good man. Don't mention it. I don't know if I would be brave enough. I'm sure you would have done the same. So I'm doing it. If only we had met earlier… We can say we met at death's door. Especially me. Two minutes. -Life is so stupid. -No. I don't think so. Yes. It is too short… Don't exaggerate. I still have two minutes. Bastard. One minute! Sorry, but it's time. Everyone goes behind the counter. Come on! Go with the others. Face the wall, eyes closed and hands up. Face the wall and close your eyes! Farewell, my friends. And do everything he says. May my death be useful. Do you have a hobby, a passion or anything? I hunt, sometimes. You are lucky. Put the ministry on. You, the manager. Come forward. Open the door and tell him what you saw. Tell them that now, I want 750,000 Francs and the car has to be automatic. I want an answer in ten minutes. Or I'll keep shooting people. Go. Get out with your hands up, we won't hurt you. You have my word. You want me to go out? Absolutely. The door! I'm a hostage! The first months are always difficult for men as energetic as you are. He is as dumb as ever! Not even able to hit the target! I will talk to this ape! The door! Hey! He just shot a hostage! So now, he wants 8 million! And an automatic car! And a short-wave radio! He wants an answer in five minutes! Otherwise, he will shoot us one by one! And I almost forgot: he says you're both the same because you both shot a hostage! And above all, he said: "Screw you!" What were you thinking? I never asked you to say that! Do you want 750,000 Francs or not? You asked for 8 million! Are you sure? About the matter in Place Charcot, after the murder of a first hostage, a second hostage just got shot. The police say it was the bank manager who got shot by the gangster as he tried to run away. Good, Minister. That is a very good decision, Minister. Goodbye. We give in. Call Cervier from the Bank of France. It's Cazeneuve. The money and car must be there at eight. I'll take care of the lockdown. I'll do it. This bastard. Bouvard speaking. At 8 p.m., you will get the money and the car! Paul, we got them! 8 million! It can't be, you are dead. You are dead, it's impossible. You think? No, not really. But all the blood… It was ink. And the gunshots? Crap. May I? Go ahead. That's incredible. It's a fake! In that case… Goodbye, gentlemen. May I? It's a fake too? Maybe. You decide. Right, of course… In any case, Bouvard is out there. He rarely uses fake weapons. What's going on now? Nothing. You know, we get angry and we end up shooting stuff. No, no new victims. Well, not yet. And don't forget your promise! You were great. All of you. Can I hug you? Go ahead. You know, I'm happy you didn't die. So am I. I knew there was an accomplice. To celebrate this, I'll buy you lunch. Go ahead and order. BAKER - CATERER - CHOCOLATIER ICE-CREAM MAKER A bit more than three hours ago, police chief Bouvard, who manages this operation with self-control, provided the hostages with some food. To prevent bloodshed, and facing the deadly determination of the hostage taker, we decided to give in. But I assure you this is the last time. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, sir. The ultimatum was fixed at eight. The hostages must be feeling so anxious. Sorry… I know it isn't very polite to leave like this, but could you release me now? Why? Isn't it nice here? I can't stand my mother worrying. -It won't be long now. -Come on, be nice. We are nice. But we give you this and still you ask for more. Come on. What will you do with all that money? 8 million… I will show him, this bastard. It's for your own sake, Bouvard. It's the State's money. They're the ones paying you. I'd go on vacation. It's exactly what we planned. Come with us. -I don't have enough money. -We do. Well yes, but… How is it going? We locked the area down, more or less. What do you mean? We don't have any more cars? We will get more. Listen, just quit and come live the tropical life with us. No. That's nice, but no. She is so dumb! Stop insisting. You're embarrassing her. Right? It is a bit embarrassing indeed… That's funny. You look cool but you're actually very uptight. Anyone would accept. Would you come with us? How much would you need? I would have to compute… In a nutshell. With 600 to 700,000 Francs, I would settle the loan for my condo and I'd be able to leave. 600 to 700,000 Francs? -More or less. -And you? Me? With 4,000 Francs extra per month, my children would be safe. You need dough, too? Well, yes. We all need dough? So I have an idea… Let's share it. If you're joking, this isn't funny. I am not. You don't have to agree. That's not what I said. No darlings, that's your money. Keep it. See? Their money? It's the State's money, it's yours and mine… It's everybody's money. After all, you're nationalized, no? Yes, but… We didn't earn this money. Speak for yourself, Odette! I was shot in the shoulder! And if we hadn't acted as hostages, there wouldn't have been any money! How much would that be per person? Will you take your favorite gadget out again? Please sir, let the professionals do their job. It's always been our policy when it comes to professionals. Yes? Yes, mister secretary. He is next to me. Very well, mister secretary. The Ministry of Interior got the order. If you fail, you won't get to have an early retirement. So, Hubert? 1,142,857 Francs and 14 cents. 1.14 million… Well, if you agree… I agree. Anyone who doesn't agree, raise your hand. Well then, it's done. I don't regret staying here. Darlings, let me hug you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Really, thank you! It's him or me. In ten minutes, Bouvard will bring us the money in small bags. Be wary of him, he's volatile. We'll remove the bills from the bags and replace them with phone books. You planned on bringing two hostages with you, right? Of course. I will be yours. Who will be the other one? Well… Yes… -You. -Me? Just drop me in Levallois. Then we get out of the bank together. You two stand in the middle to shield us from the snipers. Don't forget to put your balaclavas back. We get in the car, go on the cops' radio channel and leave. Wait… If I got it right, we steal phone books and leave with them. -Where is the money? -Have a guess. The money will be with the hostages. They never search us. I could take whatever I want. Good point. If you get caught, we will keep the money. Enough! You will end up jinxing us! PRINT SHOP LOCKSMITH This is your last chance, Bouvard. Alpha, do you copy? They'll question us separately. We must agree about the description of the two killers. Do you see them? Look closely. What does he look like, for instance? He is handsome, for sure. No, he isn't! He looks awful! He has a cleft lip, a glass eye and he is hunchbacked. Okay? Got it? What about him? Well, he is a tall Black guy. Huge, with ceremonial scars and bloodshot eyes. That's great. Let's do it again. What does he look like? There are only two of you at Omega? Why? They only gave us two cars, boss. This is ridiculous. This isn't covering, it's a colander. Calling all the cars. Use channel 14. Over. Begin the broadcast, quick! There he is! The bags. Search him. Nothing. Go with the others. The phone books. Where are the bodies? Here is yours. And the other one? In the office. He is done for. He wasn't lucky enough to face you. Right, laugh now. You may change your mind later. Are you armed? I only found this. Sam! These 2,800 pages were a bit too heavy for him. I'm okay. That must be Jean-Louis. Hello? It's Jean-Louis. What happened? Your cowboy wanted to use the deadly moccasin technique again. Well, they were stronger than him, as usual. No, no bloodshed. You know he always misses anyway. He just damaged the 16% loan poster a bit. I can put him on, he may be able to report. No? Okay, I will tell him. Okay, Jean-Louis. See you later. I have good and bad news. I will start with the good news: Jean­-Louis wishes you a merry Christmas. The bad one: you are fired. Tough, right? You're on their side? They're nice, you know. And less dangerous than you. -You won't make it. -I'm sorry? The lockdown is tight. Why did you bring the money here, then? To save time. Bouvard, you set up this lockdown. So you know how we can go through. I'm sure there is a way. May I talk to you in private? You're leaving them alone? Where is the guy that was shot? You wanted to talk? -We go fifty-fifty. -I'm sorry? 350,000 for me… But we got 8 million in the bags. They always remove 100,000 out of principle. The bastards! It's simple, you won't make it without me. With me, you will share 3,5 million new Francs. There are only three of you. Well… May I? Mr. Bouvard, I think our friends haven't updated you about our agreement. PARIS RETAIL BANK How much is 700,000 divided by eight? 87,500 Francs. I could survive. Wait, I have another condition. You need to take me with you in the car. What about me? I must look like a plausible hostage, undeniable. I am a boss, a hero, a symbol. I fought you. So you will bring me with you, weakened, on the R30 road. Hit me here. No, you. Hit me here. Is it really necessary? Hey! Can I do it? May I? We need action! Is this an interlude or what? If it continues, I'll take over. What can I do? Ask them to hurry up? Does it look real? It isn't very visible, but it will do. What's this? Some of your salary, because it's not very practical in small bundles. We can't leave all that. No, they'd suspect something. Listen, it's very simple. There are safes here. Let's put the money we couldn't carry in there. And in a few days, we will do direct debits. Well, at night, of course. To not raise curiosity. Can I hug you? Is it really necessary? The situation with the hostage taking in Rue Charcot hasn't changed, so we will go back to our usual programs. Don't shoot! Crap… The door! It's over! It's okay, it's over. I thought I'd die. Crap, right. Channel 14. To the right, avoid Epsilon. They are in Rue Saint Robert, heading to the church. To the left. -Epsilon here. I didn't see anything! -Of course not, idiot. Could you slow down? I feel sick. Keep going. We will screw them! Crap, to the right. Not bad. Now, rush towards Omega. To the right, then straight ahead. I'm going to be sick. Please, this jacket is new. These bastards only gave me two cars. I saw them! They're going north! Bikers! I forgot about them. -What do I do? -Don't panic, slow down. Well, that's nice. Let them come. And now, to the left! They're going to the restaurant. The car and both hostages were found safe and sound in a parking lot in La Défense. There were two. One was very tall… 6'2", Black, with bloodshot eyes… …and ceremonial scars poking out of his balaclava… The other one was awful, with a cleft lip and a glass eye. The other one was smaller than the tall Black guy. They were the worst killers, and I saw many in my career. Thanks to the hostages' precise description of the gangsters, I can declare we are already tracking them and will arrest them soon. ONE YEAR LATER IN THE CARIBBEAN Honey, enough! Go and play. What's wrong, darling? Nothing. I couldn't feel any better. Miss, I'd like to call Paris, 522-290-290, from my bedroom. I'll take care of it. Have a nice stay, sir. -Thank you. -You're welcome. One moment, I'm transferring you to the phone number in Paris THE "LAS GAVIOTAS" CLUB THANKS YOU This is the Interior Ministry. It's Cottier. Put the minister's office on, it's urgent! One moment. Hello? One moment, I will put the minister's office on. Subtitle translation by: Rebecca Payet-Hoareau
