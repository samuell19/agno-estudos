- Mr. Gray, Martin Gray - Yes - You found them? - Mietek Grajevsky, the kike? You Jewboys know how to survive, don't you? Hitler and Stalin never managed to exterminate you, Even God's own cleansing fire couldn't do it. You Jews are like weeds. I know your wife wasn't one of the Chosen People, but nobody abandons their family. But you, you did, your wife... your kids, you let them die, alone, in the fire. And you? You're still alive. And how do you feel? Can Jews feel ashamed? Yes. Yes they can. Shhh! It's for daddy. Shhhh! Martin, do you remember you promised us one day you'd tell us the story of your life Now you can do it, Mietek. No more excuses. You tell it so well. It's for the children, for later, when they can understand. I'll be there, near you, in my white chair. Always . You can't postpone it. You promised. Yes. I was born with the war. At the age of 14. When the butchers came. WARSAW, WINTER 1939 I know almost nothing of the years of peace before. - You! - Sir I'm only 15. - I'm too young I assure you. - You lie. According to the regulations work's only compulsory from 16. You liar! Jewish pig! Get in! Don't worry. I've done this before. They won't kill us. It's just to work detail. Keep a lookout, I'll be right back. There's a thief here. Whoever stole the silverware has 2 minutes to confess. Either him, or 10 of you. You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! I did it. La?dak! La?dak! You know La?dak, I had a friend... He died for me and I don't even know his name. Nor had the courage tell his mother. But I can't worry about it. He died without a sound. He was stronger than them. Thanks to him, I'm not afraid anymore. I've found a strength I didn't have before. If you want, you can beat them. If you want, you can die without a whimper. If you want, you can survive. They won't catch me again, La?dak. I'll be just like you. A survivor. AUTUMN 1940 ...Zamenofa Street, Zelaska Street, Wielkast Street, These are the boundaries of the Jewish quarter All Jews will be inside by November 15th. This district is not a ghetto. The Central Government advises this relocation is for humanitarian reasons and public hygiene ... to prevent the spread of epidemics Thirty-nine years, thirty-nine years. My whole life is here. And now, everything is destroyed. - 200 Zlotys. Take it or leave it. - The frames alone are worth more. Take them to the ghetto then. They want to set the Poles against us. To make their work easier. - Where are you from? - From Prague. We had to leave everything behind. Soon, we would be 500 000 Jews, locked behind our walls. Another city, within the city of Warsaw. - This is it. - A real palace. Dasha, we're lucky to have a roof at all. There are hundreds of people who don't. Martin, keep an eye out. - I have to leave you. - No. Where are you going? - To organize the reception of all these refugees. So what are we? I'm sorry, Dasha, but someone has to do it. It's always you I don't give a damn. Help your mother settle in. Keep of the streets, the Germans are about. Stay at home. - I'll be right back. - I hope so. Let's get to work! Holy Mary full of grace ... "The Lord is with thee, blessed are thou among women, - Blessed among women, and Jesus... - Martin, what are you doing? - I learn the catechism. - Why? Because one day, it might save my Jewish ass. Mum! Mum, he said a rude word Mom, I just said 'Jewish skin' - Mrs. Grajewski? - Yes Let me introduce myself, Dr. Ciljimaster, your neighbor. - I've lived downstairs many years. - Yes, my husband mentioned you. Sit down please. My sons; Jeremy, say hello. - David. - They're beautiful boys. And Martin. Where are you going? - I don't want to be in the way. - Martin! Won't be long. Halt A Jew must always remove his hat, before a German Officer. On your knees! Pig! Move! Get back! It was really true! A Polish streetcar, forbidden to the Jews right through the Ghetto. A Guard, a 'Blue', stopped people getting on or off during the crossing. To beat the butchers, I had to do what was forbidden Get beyond the wall, out of the Ghetto. Halt I hope it's not Einsatz coffee... My dear, they serve the best coffee in Warsaw How much? I'll buy. Two loaves of bread? Fifty Zlotys. Okay? They're one kilo loaves. Here's my address. I'll buy everyday. Thank you. God bless you. - Sorry I'm late. - I told you to stay home. But dad, I've been out of the ghetto and back. - Golgolewsky's bakery - Get inside! I went on the streetcar. It was unbelievably easy. - Look what I got for two loaves. - You idiot! What if the Germans ... had got you? - They never will. - Now I know how to do it. - Don't go there, Martin. I have to. I found a way to help others. Like you. I can bring in food. The more I sell, the more I can buy. I can help people survive. He has a point. Good evening, Doctor. Yes, goodnight. Good work, Martin. Come on! You know what they'll do, if they catch you? You take risks! We all have to fight. You said that! Not so loud. I don't want your mother knowing. All right, Martin. I guess I'm proud of you. At last! Where were you? What's that? Are they cakes? So can you explain now? Day after day, I did it again. Smuggling became a habit. My neighbor, Havel helped me. He delivered the stuff I brought it in. We were buying time. I bribed the 'Blues'. I had my suppliers in all the streets of Warsaw Ariana. Hello Jew. What are you doing away from your sty? What a chubby pig. He's not starving, is he. Search him. How long have you been smuggling? Don't forget the shoes. Carry on, Jewboy. We'll see you soon. I played with or against the 'Blues', the police, or the Germans, I almost forgot the misery of the Ghetto. Remember me? - Who's he? - A Jewish pigeon. - About to be plucked... - Again. My name is Martin. Allow me. Today, I have nothing. Not even good shoes. A chair for our guest. Hell, we work him over and he brings us drink! Who are you? Stefan! Stefan Jowak. I'm called Admiral. He's Zamek, the wise. He boxes. And Cuteck, our fake Nazi. I speak Yiddish and I hate all Germans. I'm Mokotow. He doesn't talk much. Marie is my sister. Have you come to bring some more loot? I came to talk business. Not with a Jew! Money's money. Jews and money go together. Tell that to the beggars in the Ghetto. Food is like gold. I know who to bribe and who will buy. The market is too big for me alone. But if we are five ... It's dangerous to associate with Jews. What do you care? Your Swastika protects you. If there's trouble, I can pass for Polish. Listen, "Hail Mary, full of grace" If the Blues don't swallow it, you walk off and 'screw the Jew'. What do you think? Should we trust him? And him? He can he trust you? Oh! Yadia... You're new... Yadia, you're beautiful! What an ass! So it began. One trip, two trips, soon it was routine. But a dangerous life. Cutek and his Nazi armband, amused the Germans who strolled round the Ghetto like tourists visiting the Zoo We made 10 runs a day up to a tonne of food, who could belive it. Pity the children. Alms for my children. Mercy! Pity! Thank you, thank you, God bless you. The Ghetto survived because smugglers were everywhere. SPRING 1941 with them came corruption Halt! Don't move! Take the bag and get off! The bag. What's going on here? Hurry up! Everything in the truck! Stop! Come on, Jew. Go on! Down My knee! Aaaah! Are you okay, Mietek? Halt Stop Don't worry. I'll find the others. We have scores to settle. The Blues knew we were coming. I know who set us up. Stefan never liked you very much. We'll take you to the Ghetto tonight. Thanks, Lydia. Do you feel like a hero? Sorry Dad, I had some trouble, but it's OK now. I hear about your troubles. Thank God your mother doesn't know you were with those crooks. - Smugglers just like me. - You? You're a child, Mietek. You did your best. I know. But your luck's run out. The Blues will be watching. So Martin, swear you'll never leave the Ghetto again. I can't. Then I'll save you from yourself. You won't leave this room until I have your word. In the Ghetto, an elite group of dealers, spies and smugglers would meet at the Cafe Sztuka. - Abraham, the chef, at your service. - Cut it out. What did you get? Fresh herring from the Baltic, and cream... - What do you need? - Flour. - A bag. Okay? - Done. It's my father! See you later. At least I can tell your mother you're alive... and well - How is she? - She misses you. And she blames me. I miss her too. Mietek, you shouldn't come here again. I heard the Germans are preparing a raid soon. Thanks for the tip. Come home. You'll be free to lead your own life. We need you, Martin. We miss you. And the next time you cross the wall, can you deliver a letter for me? Dad, you've come to the right man. JEW = Lice and typhus. I'm looking for Professor Hulewitz He's out. I'm his niece. You can wait if it's important. Well, won't you come in? Yes. You live in a palace! So you're a princess? Just Sofia. I'm just Martin. - You remind me a clown. - Oh, thank you. Just before the war, in 1938 a circus came to Warsaw. - In the Old Town Square. - No, no. The Theatre Square. I was there. Old Town Square, I'm sure. I still remember it, Mr. Clown. I know my circus. With Sofia was as if the War never existed. As if I was not Jewish. Please have pity. Sweets and kisses. Hey? What's up? - Is the war over? - Mom, I think I'm in love. - She's beautiful. - Is she Jewish? No. She's blonde, Polish and Catholic. You'll be crazy about her, like me. She's called Sofia. I promised her you'd make a Cholet A Cholet? Yes, yes, I'll get all the ingredients Whoever she is, she's making you smile. "Mein Gott!" What is this? Two dead Jews taking up three places? Move over, gentlemen, make room for a neighbor. We're all equal in the Ghetto. Just ask our landlord Adolf! - Rubinstein says thanks, Mietek! - Germans! Attention! Gentlemen! This is where Diany Blumenfeld sings. Lady please have pity. Please help me. Have Mercy. Are you frightened? La?dak! La?dak? Come on La?dak! La?dak! Where are you stupid cat? May be he's jealous. He won't come while I'm here. Well, if I must choose... La?dak, forget it! My uncle says nothing lasts forever. - Do you think we will? - Do you want to? Yes. For ever and ever. AUTUMN 1941 We're a people without a country That's why we're persecuted. How ironic. Fate. In the time of the Czars the Russians tried to destroy us. It was the Germans who protected us. Today it's the opposite. - What next? - Tomorrow? Who knows? Maybe we'll build our Nation in the Promised Land... and at last be safe. Maybe! If there are enough Jews alive. The Germans have gone mad! They're killing the best of us. Doctors, scientists, artists ... It makes no sense. For centuries, Jews have worked for all mankind. Why destroy all that? It makes no sense. Documents. They're not Jews! Poles. The butchers are furious. The Underground killed Iwo Gossim. That actor who collaborated. They took hostages. Sofia! No, Martin! No! Sofia Sofia! Stop! No! Martin! Halt! Get back! Halt! There's no point, Martin. - You can't help. - Let me go! No! You'll get killed for nothing! We tried everything, Martin. I'll do it myself then. It's too late. They shot Sofia and her uncle today. Halt! Halt Come out Jew. I'll find you. Come out, Jew. You'll need a few stitches. But your retina is torn. The choroid is damaged too. It's blocking the pupil. I've lost the eye? In future, Martin, your one good eye will be your most valuable asset. You must take care of it. Please be careful You must look after yourself. You and our young people, are the only life we have left. The streetcar stopped running. It was death to caught outside the ghetto Have pity. A few coins to bury my niece. Those not shot in the streets, or starved, died of typhus. Mercy for the dead, I can't bury. Have mercy. Alms. Halt! What have you got? Prohibited Stop! It's forbidden SUMMER 1942 all Jews living in Warsaw, will be resettled in the East. You have nothing to fear. The decision was taken by Central Government, to assure you a better life, and better working conditions. The Jewish Council and police, will assemble 6,000 people daily. - the Central Square, - What's this? will be the place of assembly. Each family is allowed 15 kilos of luggage. Bring your money, and valuables with you. With effect from today, Jews documents and health will be inspected by the authorities. - Don't let us ... - Don't push! Where are we going? What is it for? - They arrested my son. - My wife needs her job. Save him. I beg you! - Let me pass. - Do something, sir. - I beg you, save my child! - Help me! Help me! I want to work. I want to work! I want to work. Have pity sir! It's a fake exemption card. You are supposed to be working in one of Schultz's factories. And them? These exemptions won't last long. The Extermination units are already here in Warsaw. Remember one thing, Martin. The Germans are efficient. They have a plan, but ... But what? All these trains to the east? - The East maybe the death of us. - Why don't we fight? With what, huh? To get weapons, we need help from the Polish Underground. Their leaders don't like the Jews. Come out here. Come on! Yes, I'm coming! I'd better go. Aren't you coming home? I'd like to, but the President of the Jewish Council just shot himself. The Organization is falling apart. Take care of yourself. - There, There, there. - Block the street, fast! Go! - Get up! - Get up! Take your things. - Take your things! - Fast! Don't forget your money. - Fast! - Hurry up! Out! Get going! Out! Out! Away The privilege of looting houses as they searched for Jews belonged to the Ukrainians of the Waffen SS Out, out ... To the street. - Why don't we stay here? - Come on. I want to go out. I thought you liked playing hide and seek? - I want to go away. - Me too. Let's play hide and seek. You must hide to win. - Don't you want to win? - Yes Why don't you play with us? I'm too big. - Martin! - Shhh! This won't last. - We will get away. Now our priority is to survive. You sound like your father. Back quickly. Be as quiet as possible. I'll be back tonight. - Where are you going? - Shhhht! Get back! Make way for the children. Thank you God for taking them At least they'll suffer no more. You can stay, Dr. Korczak. If there's a Jew who deserves to survive, it's you. I'll go with the children. - You know their destination? - Yes, that's why they need me. Women and children to the right. Move it. Hurry up! Hurry up! You can't stay here, Mietek! Don't worry, Szemerling I've got working papers. I have to do my job. It's them or us. Faster Fast! Quick! Fast Stop! To the left! To the right! Right! Left Hey! Forwards! - Dad! What happened? - They arrested me on the street. And you? Your mother and brothers? Are they here? You must get out of here. Right! Right! You left! - No, no. No! - Let me, my husband... Forward! Go! Leave it! They're selecting workers. Copy me. Dad, I know. - Just keep walking... - Go back home, Martin. You have a chance alone. Not with me. I know what to do. Forwards. To the left! You! You, to the left. You. Right. This man is sick. He's a good worker, Mr. Schultz. Right! To the left! Saved from the train. - Now. Let's jump. - Not yet. When I say. Now! You saved us! We saved each other. I survived. I'd almost forgotten. But my son, he remembered. Shall we? I'll never forget. Never. - What? - It's the best day of my life. It's Martin. Mum, what is it? Dad's OK. I just left him. You forgot us, Martin. So has your father. No. I can't stand this. Locked up with the children. Every noise... and quiet is even worse. Trapped here behind furniture. Where is everybody? They're hiding just like us It'll be better soon. The Underground is organising. You remember your Bar Mitzvah What a party we had! My mother wasn't there. You've forgotten her now. You were very small. She never saw your brothers. She was waiting for all of us... for the holidays ... in America. Mum, stop it. I beg you, stop thinking about the past. We'll go to America. I promise. Another section of the Ghetto had died. The survivors hid, awaiting the night and a brief reprieve. But each day was a new trial. They had to find food In the survival game, some had more luck than others. Stand up. Hands on heads. Don't move. Take them. The peasant and the Snow princess , lived happily ever after Why do these stories make me fall asleep instead of them? Maybe you're not as grown-up as you think. Tonight, I feel a 100 years old. Come on. Kiss Mummy, and off to bed. - Mum, I'll wait for Dad. - I wait for you, okay? I see him so little. He'll give you a kiss when he gets here. It's me, David. Bad news, Martin. It's my father? - There was a raid. - Where is he? He's on a train going East. Good luck, Martin. What is it? Martin! - What is it? - Nothing. Tell me! Was it daddy? Just David. Daddy's very busy, He won't be able to kiss you tonight. Well then, tell us another story. You go to bed. I'll empty this. Martin! Tell me the truth! I forgot this. AUTUMN 1942 Come out. Everyone out! Come on, hurry. Out! Out! Search the houses. Back! Back! Don't cry, Mum. I'm here. To the central square. Forwards, march! Come down all Everyone out! Men, left. Women and children, right. Men, left. Women and children, right. - Out! - Outside All Jews out! Right. Left. Right. Left. Women will not work! - Get back! - Martin! Go left!

Get all this sorted. Clothing, hats and shoes. Everything separate. Get to work! Don't forget they have to leave all their things. Watch your face. A scar means death. Klepssuda. Halt Open your mouth! Spit! Jewish pig! Thief! Over there! Klepssuda! Move! I don't want to die! What are you doing? What do you think? That's what they want. We must live to tell the world. At least get revenge! Come on, get to work! PARADISE STREET Open the doors! Let's get to work! to work! Work Faster, Jews pigs. Idiots! If you slack, I'll help you rest. Idiots! Idiots! Don't dawdle! Get moving! Zachariah! You! Take his place! Why didn't you check their mouths, Jew? Little children don't have gold teeth. That's logical Don't forget that. Jew pig! Work! Are you sick? Any scars? There's no mark. - Tell the truth. I won't kill myself. - There's nothing. I swear to you. I know you. You're Mietek. The smuggler from the Ghetto. I am Moishe. Do you remember my father? Grajewski. He come here. Have you seen him? Thousands come to Treblinka most die in the first 10 minutes. Abraham is here. In the kitchen. - Who? - Abraham ... The Cafe Sztuka? I puit a word in for you with the Kapo. Abraham? Abraham, you have a new helper. And for Mietek? A table near the band? I saved these. I'm sorry, no cream, no herring. Eat. Quick! Did you see my father here? Have I seen my mother? Who knows where the dead are? Eat, boy, eat. Men, left. Women and children, right. - What's going on? - It's OK, it's OK. Keep your clothes on! Don't undress! I'm a Catholic. I'm not Jewish I'm not Jewish Take the Jews! Look! I converted! I'm... You should remember me. You can open it. Now we're even. Long ago, in the Ghetto, my daughter was in the street. She was cold, hungry, you gave her some cakes. I remember. - Golgolewsky's bakery. - That's right. They were the last she ate. I am grateful to you, Mietek. You knew my father? Can I ask one more thing? If I can. You! Put that down. You look tired. Good luck to you, Mietek. Mr. Gray In Treblinka ... I was a man trapped. Under sentence of death. Now I was free, I had to forget. Learn to life again. Later would be time enough for remembering. I crossed fields and forests. I walked, ran, lived like an animal. I found Jews, who thought they were free. When I told them about the death camps, they wouldn't listen I learned later they died there. Sometimes the Poles hunted me. sometimes they hid me. But I survived. MARCH 1943 In Russia, the butchers were about to lose the war. at Stalingrad. Thanks to Polish partisans I returned to Warsaw, using fake papers. I'm Mietek. Mietek? Mietek? Mietek! You're alive! Thank God! Yours or mine? You're so thin! Mietek! Come in! Tell me everything, Mietek. There's not much to say! Everyone's dead. They didn't die in vain. Your people are fighting back. They're killing Germans in the Ghetto. If Jews were fighting in the Ghetto, my place was with them. You can go back now. Halt Good luck, Mietek Fifty thousand Jews had survived the deportations. Despite the Nazis' fury and the world's indifference. The greatest danger to the Nazis is from the chimneys of Warsaw. General Stroop, is ordered to 'clean' the Ghetto It will be a bloody battle but we have our faith. We fight not for our own lives, but the value of life itself. Not to avoid death but to choose the way we die. The longer we resist, the the longer the world must.. ...hear our voice. Our day has come. If we can just resist one week, then our voice will live forever. My father had also survived. He jumped off the train, before reaching Treblinka. Only life is sacred, Martin. But survival itself, makes no sense. it's ... It's who you survive for that matters. Remember that. One day you'll have children. Give them all of you. Because children... ...are our future. Like you, you are mine. Ah, the future! One day, you'll go to New York, see your grandmother. She loves you very much. I can't think why, she only saw you once and you pissed in her lap. But whenever she wrote, she's want pictures. So you see? You're her future too. Go and see her! She and mum were very close. The days were spent preparing for what would be our uprising. The butchers no longer dared venture into the Ghetto. Our combat unit, the OJC ruled the Ghetto for now. Confrontation was inevitable. Don't listen to the agitators! They won't give you work. Or feed your children. But I will! Come and work in our new factories outside Warsaw in Poniatowa. There, you'll have work and food. Even schools for your children. I give you my word. Work, and bread. And you'll survive the war. The evening before Monday 19th April 1943 ... large forces of Polish and German police, surrounded the walls of the Jewish Quarter. Families took refuge in bunkers that we built. At dawn, SS-General Stroop sent in his elite troops. 19th APRIL 1943. Grajewski Yes? Commander's orders. Don't fire until the Germans reach the crossroad. Did you hear? Go on! Fire at will! Get back! Back! Don't shoot. The street is ours! The street is ours! They coming back! Inside! Inside! Hey! Wake up! I want you to take this message to HQ On my way. Martin Take care, son. You're all I have That's all I ask. Don't get yourself killed. Don't worry. The 2nd day of the uprising, at the other end of the Ghetto, the factory sector ... where many Jews worked was still quiet. 'The Mila sector needs ammunition'. Shameka, David, organise it. There they are. They're coming! We want a cease fire for 15 minutes to collect our dead and our wounded! And to give you time to come to your senses. If you surrender, there will be no reprisals against Jews. You will be evacuated to a work camp at Poniatowa. Withdraw! Get to the Swintorjerska bunker! Get back! Martin! Your father isn't here. He left earlier with a group. - Where to? - To HQ at the brush factory. I come from, exactly. Jews, surrender. Come out if you want to live. Jews, surrender. Come out if you want to live. Surrender Jews, if you come out we'll let you live. Come out if you want to live. Victory! I will live! For all of you. And you will live in the memories of men. I swear it. Those who were not killed, or executed, were deported. The fighting lasted an entire month. The butchers blew up the buildings and razed the Ghetto. Take care of yourself, Martin. I don't want you to die. Don't worry. They missed their chance. They won't catch me again.. - Make them pay dearly, Mietek. - I will. Thank you both. For everything! Remember, we both love you very much. Marie especially. Goodbye Mietek. I never saw them again Goodbye Mokotow. Goodbye Marie. I'll never forget you. I had left to fight with the Polish partisans. When I returned, it was late summer, 1944. It was in the NKVD, a Lieutenant in the Red Army charged with hunting down Nazi collaborators. Already we were driving towards Germany. The Polish people ... who had fled the fighting, were returning home. Not happy Mietek? Don't forget... Our victory is yet to come. Execute them! Execute them! Quick! Quick! Quick! Wait a minute! Wait. To Berlin! To Berlin! To Berlin! BORDER Vengeance was bitter. We found a frightened coountry. The Germans who considered themselves a master race, were broken and pathetic. Can you print a poster? I need posters by tomorrow morning. And you'll put them up. Write! "All Aryans, over 16, are hereby ordered to wear a swastika armband. within city limits, this is mandatory". Sign it 'Russian Authorities'. Don't forget. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, wake up! They're going crazy. Nazi Pigs It's a provocation! Shoot them all. That's enough. Hey, soldier! Go on! Take off the armbands. You can go now. Go home. Just like in the Ghetto. They know how it feels. Like us. BERLIN - MAY 1945 I entered Berlin on my 20th birthday. It was the final assault against the butchers. With my comrades, I was there to finish the fight ... that had started in the Ghetto. But this time, the tanks, were on our side. You swore allegiance to Hitler? Yes. I saw boys like you, shooting at our soldiers. Did you do that? So what did you do when we were fighting in the streets? I was hiding in our basement with my mother. Sign it. So, Misha? What have we got? Children, Sir. The F?hrer called them Werewolves They all swore allegiance. Which makes them war criminals in our eyes. But I think most of them didn't know what they were doing. Children, but Nazi children. They would have glady killed us. You didn't win medals fighting little lambs. We weren't at war with lambs. So you can't make peace with them. They need to understand they're beaten. Once and for all. Misha, rumour is there are beautiful furs coats in Leipzig Not for ourselves. But for our wives maybe... You're Jewish. Jews are smart, so be smart and find me those furs. Yes sir. Jurek? He just condemned a dozen kids, and he's having fun. Halt! Load Aim Ready, fire! No! Mietek! Mietek - Mietek, I caught Schultz! - Fat Shultz, from the Ghetto? What do you want? Don't hurt me. What do you want? Come to see you, Schultz. Come here! Do you recognize me, Schultz? Remember the Central Square? You're Jews! I tried to always protect you. I gave you jobs. But I had orders too. Quotas to meet. I didn't know where the trains went... Nobody told me. Please Lieutenant, pay me something, no matter what, but something... Mietek They've released Schultz. He's going to work for them. It's impossible! I was there. - I'll speak to the Colonel. - It won't do any good. You were right Mietek. They're stealing our revenge. There's nothing for us here. - I'll talk to the Colonel, he'll listen. - No, Mietek. Goodbye! I'm leaving. Good luck You had Warsaw, we had Stalingrad. Don't count the dead with me, Misha. We also had Treblinka Dachau, Auschwitz and Majdanek, I know. I know all that. Thank you. There were Russians in those camps too. The trouble with you Jews... I'm sorry, Misha, but it's true, you take the war... so personally. I want the top Nazis, and Schultz knows them. He'll give me names and testify. But Schultz is a war criminal! That's debatable. I would say more an opportunist than criminal. The Red Army had taken me to Berlin. I had fought for them, we were even. But they sidetracked my revenge. We parted ways. I deserted. Go through customs at the end of the ramp Okay, okay. Keep it moving. All right, soldier. - Are you a Communist? - Just a Jew. A Polish Jew. Martin? My little Martin! Let him through, please. I knew it! I knew it was you. You're so like your mother. Like the pictures she sent. You're a man now. Come in, Martin! You're home now. You must be hungry. Put your things away. Your room is there, and the bathroom is next door, if you want to freshen up. You'll see your uncle tonight. He's got you a job in his shop. Martin I made you a cholet you like that? I'll teach your wife. When you marry and have children... And you will, Martin. I want to be a great-grandmother! I never met David! Or Jeremy! Why were they killed? Why? I worked. I worked furiously. it was the only way... I could bury my past. Over the years, I finally managed it. Luck was with me. I'd become a rich American. But, I was still alone. Until the day I met Dina. Maybe we'll see each other again. I must go to Holland soon. I have to go to Germany tomorrow. Thank you, Martin. I'm glad I met you. Wait! For my apartment. In case you want to use it. While I'm gone. Do you like children? I'd love to have them with a man like you. I wanted my own family and I finally had one. For ten years, day after day, we built our happiness ... in the South of France, not far from the sea, under the hills of Taneron. Arrival of Air France flight 22, from New York, gate eight. It was yesterday, Saturday. A fierce wind had risen, it hadn't rained for months and farmers were suffering. 3rd OCTOBER 1970 . What a wind! - Can you get home alright, Lelli? - Yes, the wind will push me. - Good Weekend! - Thank you. - Until Monday. You too. - Bye, Lelli! Michelle and Martin Does anyone want more? No, thank you. Good I think he's happy. It's because he's eating. And because he's home. And because it has "quesaco." It is said "coat" with a C is not "quesaco." I'm happy because we're all here in our house, and I have ... nothing else to do but enjoy these moments. And keep your promise to mum. You know why we built you an office. The window! - Mum! - Fire. The oil tank. - I want to see, Daddy. - No! Stay with mum. Hey, stay here with me. Come on Richard. - What do we do, Mum? - Let's get to the car! I'm taking the kids! Come on, jump. Quick! Go to Mandelieu. I'll meet you there. I'll see if Lelli's OK. Mandelieu! Mandelieu! Come on, jump. 'Martin, you must look after yourself' 'All life is sacred.' 'Remember that!' 'But survival alone, has no value.' 'It's who we survive for, that is important.' 'One day you'll have children. Give them all of you.' 'Because children are our future.' 'Just as you are mine.' Years later, Martin Grayewski created a new family. He remains a witness against the barbarism of the executioners. His life is an inspiration to us all.
