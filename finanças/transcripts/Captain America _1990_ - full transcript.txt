If you're not careful you'll end with a terrible wrinkles... ...Here and here... ...And here, like your mom. What's this? - Why invade my home? - Fire The pressure is normal, blood White down 30%... ...And have to reach 70%. Make it simple! Are you saying that even we can not do the implant. You can guarantee that you can do if blood pressure... - ...Decreases few points. - And when would that be? To be completely sure say...? Twenty minutes? What is this pistol, De Santis? What, this? This is not a gun. It is a surgical tool... Made specifically... for you. There is so much tragedy, Tom. Do not you understand that your people will happier with their new president? See you in twenty minutes. Follow telling the story it made, please. We can establish a complicity between the Soviets and kidnapping. - It's too obvious. - We always worked before. - Why not? - Sure! Yes! Not long now, General. This time I will not fail.

Today you will die. 50 years ago you were the ridiculous Dr. Vaselli idea! You're still a symbol ridiculous that no one cares. I care. You care. Then come to me, my brother. Let's see if this heart of yours is stronger than my hate. You're still a poor wimpy, little brother. Stop calling your brother! Steve! Mr. President! Thank you! You were this close when you killed my mother? Closer. No, that was very fast. To you rather see you suffer slowly. That was a submachine gun. This is a detonator! Did you really think you were going to capture me alive? In regard to megatones, this device does not have the same scope... But enough... to ensure... Throughout South... Europe will destroyed and uninhabitable by... Say a century... Perhaps one or two decades. Seventy million lives snuffed like the fire of a candle. And Captain America can not do anything about it. Dad! Do not get up! Whatever happens! - Twelve, nine - De Santis! Just a second. De Santis! The two are a tragedy. And now send our tortured souls to rest. Speak for yourself! Watch your back! Today in Rome, 116 nations agreed environmental protection treaty. In a brief statement after the agreement, President Kimball... ...asked to recall all people who sacrificed everything... ...to make our world a better place to live. The President closed his statement with this strange message... ...When Captain America, where ever you are... ...all stand back in the struggle.
