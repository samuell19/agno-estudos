Keep him here for further observation We will perform a bone marrow biopsy This can't be happening! Mom You are awake It's okay I guess my mom and dad were afraid I'd start to cry so they kept saying to me: don't worry, everything is fine Later I asked them about my guitar They told me: don't worry, everything is fine After that I started my new life and moved into the hospital To be honest other than the poking and prodding from the doctors and the nurses and other than being stuck with an assortment of needles it actually wasn't that bad Limited edition! Eat them, I will buy you coke Give them to me Mom I'm hungry You can't eat Mom, I want a snack I can't live without snacks Ow, that hurts!

Too Young to Die! Too Young to Die! Too Young to Die! Too Young to Die! Too Young to Die! I've started my chemotherapy How are you feeling? I just want to say the F'word Slowly Here, I felt the same when I was at first round of chemotherapy This was my patron Take it and you'll feel better Leave me alone It's so boring being staying in the ward all of the time Then, open the window and listen to the rest of the world Chemotherapy is too painful and I keep losing my hair Even if I am cured I am definitely going to become ugly I got solution for this give me your address How do you feel? There's a package for you It's already been disinfected Who sent it? A friend I met online A friend you met online? What kind of friend buys you so many hats? Eat slowly Slow down Here's my gift for you I think they will fit you perfectly Yang, it's time for your blood drawing Mom, I don't want to I don't want to Why do I have to draw blood every day? It's so we can examine your health I don't need any examination Can't you see how I am? I don't want to I don't want to Can we do this later? Ok, but don't let him eat anything Of course I won't eat anything just look at my mouth The doctor says Yang should shave his head OK... Mom, I want to sit up Slowly Are you comfortable sitting like this? I'm good Son, the other day Aunt Zhang told me something that made me laugh Do you know the girls today if they want to determine if an actor is handsome they'll watch him in a TV show set in the Qing Dynasty Do you know why? Because they believe that a man can only be considered handsome if he still looks good without any hair What do you think? Isn't that funny? That's not funny at all Stop lying to me I have a very risky leukemia The recovery rate is less than 50% Who told you that? I am 13 years old I can figure it out myself I'm very aware that one day I'll be just like Brother Chao I'll just die all of a sudden I haven't done anything I want to do and now you are forcing me to shave my head I don't want to die There are so many things that I haven't done Why me? Why not Steven? Why not Xia Chen or Wang Ji? Why am I the one who had to get sick? Now I have to shave my head I hate you I think I have been too patient with you these years Now, you won't even listen to the doctor Do you think I want you to shave your hair? Do you think that I want to see you sick? I'd rather it were me who was sick I'd shave my hair for you I would give my life for you So don't you ever say such words to me. Ever! You're going to be fine I know it! You have to shave your head I'm good. You should check on him Yang look what I bought for you It's a massage machine You can massage your shoulders, neck and legs It was on sale at 40% off! Here Enjoy it Dad I don't want to be bald I don't want to be bald Why am I sick? I don't want to be bald I don't want to be bald Don't be sad Don't be sad In comic books they say that having your head shaved is like having a fresh start From the moment my mother shaved my head I became a full-time patient From then on I was no longer the person I used to be Don't cry There's no need to cry You will grow new hair It's ok Even though I lost my hair I'm determined to leave something behind in this world Xiaoruo Come with me What about your homework? I'll do it later Wang Xinyang Stop making noise It's ok Why do you make so much noise? It's ok What are you doing? There's so much noise You're still alive? How's the chemotherapy? It sucks After going through all this I think I understand the way you felt a little bit more You guys keep talking I'm going back there to have a look Are you still playing the guitar? I haven't practiced recently The chemotherapy was killing me but luckily it's over now I feel better In fact, I plan to do what I really want That's why I'm here After this chemotherapy we are sort of on the same side So do you want to join our band? Wang Xinyang before I came here I played keyboard in a band A real band, by the way so much better than yours After I suddenly got sick they said they would wait for me But when I came to the rehearsal room after my first round of chemotherapy I saw a new keyboard player Why? Why did they find a new guy to replace you? They don't have to wait for a dying person Do you get it? Wait a second! I don't understand but I can tell you our band, Too Young to Die won't abandon you Do you know why? Because we're not going to die We will write great songs and sing them to the world We'll sing them to everyone Let the past be the past Please think about it And don't forget I saved your life once so you owe me a favor Hey Finished talking? Yes, let's go Wow, what a surprise Will this look too exaggerated? Ok, now we have something important to do Tie them to this Pass me that, Zhuang What? That It's down there Come on, follow me One, two, three, go After Brother Han joined us our band is getting better and better Great, I am happy for you! Brother Han improved my song he's so talented！ The guitar will start first Listen to the first part with the guitar What do I play? Don't eat like pears We haven't found the right match for Yang I'm afraid we have to wait For how long? Be patient It's not easy to find the right match for transplantation We'll try our best So many wrong answers What should we do? Don't worry I will help him with studies after he recovers Today the doctor told me about an imported drug Each injection costs more than 2,000 yuan More than 2,000 yuan? It works well Soon we're going to run out of our savings If it works, buy it We'll figure out a way Can you ask your brother to return the money you lent him? The other day I tried to ask him He can't return the money now He's my brother He didn't have money to get married,I had to help him We've talked about this before What about our son? Don't you care about him? Of course I care How? We are trying every possible way to give him the best treatment Which ways? I was thinking about... How can we afford his treatment? I have borrowed money from all my relatives Ask your parents for money, okay? What are you talking about? I haven't told them about Yang's illness They have heart disease, you forgot? I know So what now? This won't work, that won't work Should we just give up? Honey, honey, honey Don't be mad at me. Don't worry How can we afford treatment? Say something! I will figure out something tomorrow I'll think of a way We aren't suitable transplants for Yang don't you know? Let's have another child Another child? Yes You're back Where is Zhuang? What happened? You should work harder on your studies Too many wrong answers Are you going to abandon me? What are you talking about? You were talking about having another child Yang, we were talking about having another child so that maybe they can give us another chance to be a match for you Don't be silly Haven't you always wanted a little sister? Forget it This isn't fair for Wang Ziqing Wang Ziqing? Who is Wang Ziqing? It's the name I'm giving to my little sister You've done my job I want her to know that she wasn't born to save me but that she came into this world because her family loved her Mom what if... what if you don't love me anymore after she is born? What would I do? Am I being selfish? We will always love you Always Why haven't you gone to work? Why are you back? Who will take care of Yang? Yang is asleep I left in a hurry yesterday and forgot to bring my laptop You didn't sleep well last night? You don't go to work today? No We keep asking for time off to look after our son This can't be our long-term plan Are you willing to do that? Yes I've figured out that the money we would get for selling the car won't be enough for Yang's treatment I want to sell the house We have to sell it What do you think? You always liked the open kitchen OK We will buy a bigger one after our son is recovered A bigger one Be careful with the moon I'll take it It's ok How's your waist? It's ok The bike I'll get this, you go first Do you need help? No, I can handle it Now that Brother Han has joined us our band has leveled up Shouldn't we celebrate? I have an idea Come here, guys I think we can hold a Too Young to Die concert on the rooftop A concert？ The hospital will have a celebration over Spring Festival Here is the application form but you need a lot of signatures I'm not sure if this will work or not Nurse Zhang gave us the application form Please sign it It's getting colder The wind is very strong on the rooftop I'm worried that you'll catch a cold We won't catch cold You can't do this, Zhuang Yang, your mom is right Although it's summer, it's still cold outside It's especially cold at night It's not cold It's not a good idea to hold a concert given their health condition I know But while they've been in this hospital the children have formed very strong relationships And we, as parents, want to help them accomplish their goals Our band can put on a concert! Brother Han's dad will sponsor us You guys are so awesome! We are still practicing I hope we don't screw up Help yourselves It's my treat today Which is your son? May I invite you to our concert? Three, two, one Grandma promise me you'll come to our concert Sorry, I can't make it this time Would you sing for me when we both are recovered? Hi everyone We are the band Too Young to Die Today we will perform the song "When I grow up" for you The song represents our wish that all of us will be happy as we grow up The guitar plays in a chaotic rhythm It's my first song I'm a carefree youth with a young heart I don't understand what's in front of me I bravely run towards it without fear come on We shall keep in touch after all what we've been through Promise me you'll remember the song I wrote for you In the years ahead I will grow up with you In the big city there is a little me Time slows down the cloud sings with the sun Don't fear loneliness Heal the wounds Become stronger with a big smile I will embrace the sun and the blossoming flowers We shall keep in touch after all what we've been through Promise me you'll remember the song I wrote for you In the years ahead I will grow up with you Promise me we'll sing this song together when we grow up Zhuang, wake up!

I'm doing chemotherapy again I think the world is so unfair don't you agree? Of the three main indicators his hemoglobin levels are slightly lower the other two are within the reference range Which means...

Are you all ready? I fly away towards the light I fly away against the wind When I wander about in the clouds you'll remember that I can't forget your shoulders and arms we all remember the days when I grew up freely and wildly I fly to a far away place with your love Look up to the sky, you can see me sing with tears and my wings open wide We've had our best moments I flap my wings to make the wind blow against your face When I wander about in the clouds you'll remember that I can't forget your shoulders and arms we all remember the days when I grew up freely and wildly I fly to a far away place with your love Look up to the sky, you can see me sing with tears and my wings open wide We've had our best moments I flap my wings to make the wind blow against your face Thanks Thanks Thanks My life was kind of short but it was fulfilling I feel very happy So I want to use this song to thank my mom and dad and people who loved me and this beautiful world that I've belonged to when I grew up freely and wildly I fly to a far away place with your love Look up to the sky, you can see me sing with tears and my wings open wide We've had our best moments I flap my wings to make the wind blow against your face There's a question that I've been wanting to ask you What? How long will you remember me? Why do you call yourself "Sea-salt Cheese Cake with No Added Sugar"?
