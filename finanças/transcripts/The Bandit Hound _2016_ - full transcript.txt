Mr. , I really think once you see these numbers, you're gonna be convinced that we're gonna put because it's only the best option that you have. We've done some comparisons, oh, here, thank you, Madeline. As you can see, your investments will continue to grow even during difficult economic times. We can open an account right now. - I think I'm going to wait. - I understand. - But thank you for your time. - Good day. - It's a very good day. Send him in. - Merry Christmas! Excuse me! - Oh, hello. Good afternoon, would you be so kind as to fill my backpack with 100 dollar bills, you have two minutes, don't try anything funny. Oh, yes, I'm going, I'm going. Here we go, keys. Going, okay, okay, okay. Dog with a bomb, dog with a bomb, dog with a bomb, dog with a bomb, go go go, dog with a bomb! What are you waiting for? - The bomb! - How'd it go? - Keep it down back there, will ya?! - A tracking device. Would you have found this? You know Manny, I was thinking. Maybe next time we should use a real bomb just in case if they catch him. He'll lead them to us, not like we couldn't get another mutt. - What are you saying? That any ol' dog could do what he did? - If you train them, they'll do whatever you want. - It's not that easy. Bandit is one of a kind. A natural born thief, and not dog things like squeaky toys and bones. He steals gold, silver, jewelry. So no talk about blowing him up, okay? He's one of a kind. - Where are you going? - I'm going to the bathroom, if that's all right with you. Bandit, keep an eye on him! - Just to keep an eye on him. Such a stupid dog. I feed you a biscuit, best friends. See? Biscuit, best friend. Hey! Hey! Shut up! - What's going on here? - Probably a boy stuck in a well. - 1XL-520, 1XL-520, requesting backup at the abandoned warehouse on Hill and 6th. - What do you got in your pockets? Nothing. - Oh yeah? Come on, show me what you have in your pockets. - I got nothing in my pockets. Police! Hands up! - Oh "nothing in your pockets." - You should really learn to keep your dog quiet if you're gonna have him do your dirty work. Hey, don't move! Hold it! - Bandit! Don't move! Here, put him in here! It's off to the pound with you, boy. - Ahh! That's funny. - Thanks a lot. - Hey hey hey, don't blame me, blame the scrap heap of a bike. - Yeah, scrap heap! - Hey, give that back! - Hey, over here, over here. Hey, watch out. You play with dolls? - Man, busted toys, busted bike. What'd you come from, Skid Row? - This kid's a loser. - The way I see it, there are two ways that this is gonna go down. You can pick on me for a couple of months, I'm not really sure how bullying's done around here, but you'll probably learn I do not have as much money or friends as you guys do, and eventually you'll see that we're not all that different and I'm actually kinda cool. Or two, we could just fast forward and try to be friends. At least acquaintances. Is for dirt bags like you! - Geek! - You know what, fine, just give me back the Captain and I'll leave. - Captain? - Oh no. - What is he, like Captain Kirk? Yeah, who are you, Mr. Spock? - More like Mr. Loser. - Whoa! - Here here! - Hey, thanks. Cool dog. The mail! Did it come yet? - No. Yes, look, I'm telling you, you need to put me on a payment plan. Oh great, yeah, yeah, just have your supervisor call me, I can't wait to explain all this again. Bummer. Owen, what? - Report card didn't come. You know, we should just assume my Fall grades were good and go ahead and get a dog, yeah? - How's the neighborhood, kiddo? - I mean Christmas is just around the corner -- - Neighborhood? - Well to be honest, a plight. - That bad, huh? Look, maybe next time you should go out without the Captain. - Mom, be honest with me, are we not gonna be poor soon? - This new job is gonna give us a whole lot more than we had in awhile. I still have to sort out dad's hospital bills, but I will and at least now we're in the same neighborhood as Aunt Deb. Look, we will talk about a dog when your report card comes in. - Yeah, like it's ever gonna. - You wouldn't happen to mean this report card, would you? - You had it the whole time? - It's not bad, not too bad, but a B- in science? - I promise I'll try harder at this new school, so can we get a dog, pretty please? - Well... - I know the drill, I'll walk it every day and feed it, make sure it doesn't smell, clean up all its -- - I spoke to the landlord. Yes, we can have a dog. Wait, hang on, hang on a minute, on one condition. School starts in a couple of weeks and I want you to really make an effort to make new friends, it can't be just you and the Captain. You gotta give this place a fair shot. - I promise, Mom. Yes yes yes, woohoo! - Like I was ever gonna say no. - I've got a surprise for you! Who's that? - Well I found him on the street, he reminded me of Bandit. - You found him? - Yeah, he's a stray dog, you know, it's just like Bandit. - How come he has a collar and a tag? - You gotta see what he can do with a frisbee. I thought maybe you could train him like you did Bandit. Damn it, I thought I lost them. Don't open it! - Yes? - You stole our dog! - You stole our dog! - What are you two talking about? - You stole Leaper, I saw you! - What? - Give him back, or we're gonna - Punch you in the mouth! - Punch you in the mouth! - Yeah, well go ahead and try it! - Hold on a sec, sorry about this mixup. Here, you use this, you get Leaper the biggest bone you can find, okay? Here he comes. Come on, Leaper! - Come on, Leaper, come on! Good dog! See ya! - Jerk! - Yup. Police are looking for us. The kids could call the cops! - I thought if we had another dog, we could rob banks again. - Robbing banks is a difficult trick. Only Bandit can do it. - We can try, there are other dogs! - Not for me. Bandit's never coming back. - Let me just tell you, cleaning ladies hate dog hair. You'll never get anybody if you have a dog. I don't know that right now is the best time for the two of you to get a pet, I mean you just got here. Can you even afford it? - Yeah. Can we just not talk about money? Owen's always wanted a dog and we could never have one. With John in the hospital, I promised him. You don't even know where these dogs come from! I mean that one could have a disease, that one could be capable of eating small children. - Trevor, we found a new home for Abbie! - Oh, great, thank you. - Which one do you want, Toddy? - All of them. - Well you can't have them all. We'll take these three. How much do I owe you? - Can you just hold on a moment? - You realize his feet are filthy. Oh my God, are you... He has... His private parts. - It's a boy. - I know, but I don't need to see that. - It's a boy! - Oh, oh, don't put him, no no no no no! - You interested in this guy? - He seems sad. - Dogs can get that way. Especially when they're abandoned. Some of them lose faith, you know? - What's his name? - Don't have one yet. Only had him a few days. - Hey boy! You okay? He's a little scared, feeling all alone in a new place. Got him from the Central LA Pound and he was redlisted. - Redlisted? That sounds bad. - It is. Trick with the dogs, you let them come to you, you gotta let them gain your trust. Come here. Come here. That one too. - Are you sure, Toddy? - Yes, I want that one too! - I'm sorry ma'am, I don't think we have anything for you here. - What about all these dogs? - Why don't you two run to the toy store and just call it a day? - I'll have you know that money is no object, I can make an extremely large donation to your Heart Rescue Center. - Maybe you should buy yourself some manners. - Maybe you should buy yourself a doggy bone and chew on it. Maybe you should buy yourself some decent clothes. What is this, a dog shelter or a homeless shelter? - Okay, okay -- - Maybe you should buy yourself a life instead of hanging around with dogs. - That's a good one. You're so smart, Toddy. Come on, baby, let's remove ourselves from this kennel. Are you sure you don't want a pony? - That was bold, I'm impressed. - Well when you get right down to it, I'd rather them have a good home than just any home. - What's his breed? He's an Australian Shepard, very smart breed. - Shepards? Yes. - Joanne. - Seems like a very good dog. - Like a prison guard dog? They can be very aggressive, I've heard the stories, I'm sorry. - You're thinking of a German shepard, and those stories are about the irresponsibility of owners, if the owner is bad, the dog is bad too. - What do you think, Owen? That's a pretty good start. Okay. Okay, here are some papers, I assume your husband's all game for a dog. - Yeah, he would be if he were around, he passed away a year ago. - Oh, sorry to hear that. - Owen and I are making a new start, we just moved out from Ohio. - Ohio? I love Ohio, I'm from Colombus. - When did you move out here? - 41 years ago. - That would make you -- - 42. But I'm assuming things are pretty much the same. Well I didn't mean it like... All right, look, if you can keep me up to date on the little guy. And if you need anything, you can call me. I mean call us. Or me. Call whenever. - We're leaving the dog man now, Joanne. - Thank you. Could you go any slower? - You didn't want us to get pulled over for speeding, did you? We got the puppy pen sorted, and we're starting on the individual cages, oh, and a very nice couple wants to adopt Barney. - That's good, we did well. - Excuse me, I'm looking for the Australian Shepard I saw on your website. - We just found it a home. - That's too bad. - How is that too bad? - I promised my daughter a dog for her birthday and that's the only kind she wants. - I'm sorry, that's the only one we had. - You think it's possible I could talk to the people that adopted him, I mean they haven't had enough time to really bond? - Privacy policy restrictions, but leave your name and your phone number, next time we get one in, we'll give you guys a call. - Thank you, but the problem with that, her birthday's in two days. - Sorry, wish I could help, hey Sarah, I need your help with something. Sure, be right there! - Granted, he has a certain scruffy appeal, but he probably smells like wet dog when he gets home, you can't call him. - Deb, not in front of Owen. - No, I think you should call him, mom. He seems pretty cool. - Okay, that is enough from the both of you. - Hey boy, got a lot of space here to play. I mean outside, there's a lot of space here to play. Come on. - I mean come on, you gotta admit that's pretty cute. - Joanne, we need to talk. - You see? We got this doggy door for you. That way you can come out here whenever you want. Come on, try it. - Deb, enough! You treat me like I am some out of work truck stop waitress, I have a job, I start on Monday. - This is it. Casa de Owen. This is my dad. Wish you two could've met. Do you remember your old family? Found a hiding place, huh? A paralegal. - What is that supposed to mean? - Just please just take the check, just take it! - You know what? Money is not the answer to everything! Okay, I told you Deb, I need to do this on my own. - Oh God, if you say that one more time. - Money again. It's always money. Okay, come on, what do you want? You want the toy? Yeah, look. Squeaky, squeaky, I know you want it. What about the treat? Yeah, it smells very good, like bacon and chicken, yeah, come on, come on. You can't stay down there forever. - Are you sure that's the one? - Yeah, let's go. What's that for? - I'm not taking any chances this time with the cops. - Just keep it out of sight. Come on, it's a kid and a dog. Have you thought of a name yet? - Not yet. Mom, I don't think he really likes it here. - You have to give it time. - I know, but look. I mean I made his bed and everything, but he hasn't come out all day. - You remember what Trevor said. You have to gain the dog's trust. - Yeah, I know. - All right, give it time, kiddo. Okay, goodnight. - Night, Mom. The thing is, I know it's scary being in a new place. I mean after Christmas break, I'll go to this new school and make all these new friends and I know that you're probably thinking where am I. Well it's cool. I'll be here when you're ready. Night, boy. - It's locked! Yes, I know. What are you doing?! - I don't think I can fit in there. - You can't! - Don't worry, Manny, I got you covered out here! - Yell my name, why don't you. - I'm sorry, Manny. - Just get out. Bandit. - Wha... That you, boy? Are you okay down there? Good boy. Night. - Oh my God, hi you! You're cute! I want him for Christmas! - Consider it done, consider it done. - Oh my God. - Somebody, can we get a contract for the puppy? Let me put it in my bag. No, we're getting a contract. - Hey, where are you going with that? - He's not here. - Well? - He's probably looking for us. - So what are you gonna do? - We're gonna check the neighborhood. - Come on! - We're not leaving until we find him. Now that's what I'm talking about! You know, I'm not really a dog person, I'm more of a cat person. But I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship, pooch. Hey! That little... Ugh! That was my burger and fries. I was even gonna splurge and have a Coke. Now it's saltines and crackers! Why?! Why?! You punk! - It's okay, boy. The doctor's going to give you a checkup and make sure that you're healthy. I know the doctor can be scary sometimes, but it's important that they see you so that you can grow up to be big and strong. - Thank you, Doctor Schulman. Bobo's gonna be just fine. Not like him. - Aren't you, big guy? Don't make me a liar. Owen? - That's me. - Come on in, let's get this guy examined. Wow, an Aussie. Great breed, really smart, energetic, loyal, what's his name? - Actually I just got him and he doesn't have one yet. - He doesn't? Well considering he's so smart, how about Einstein? Smarty Pants? - What? - Plato? Never mind. You gotta keep yourself amused if you've been doing this for as long as I have. Well let's see. God, look at those eyes. Beautiful. Let's take a look at those chompers. Come on, open wide. He's got a little green stuff stuck back there. You may wanna think about brushing his teeth a little bit more. And his nails... He could use a pet-icure. Get it? A pet-icure? Okay, just another silly joke. - So how about training them, is that hard? - A dog this smart, this breed, you'd probably be able to train him to do anything you want. Okay, here you go, Owen. Everything went fantastic. - Thank you so much, Doctor Schulman. - My pleasure seeing you both. Alright, take care. - Oh, Doctor, your wife called and she needs your credit card number to buy those tickets. - Cool, absolutely, been looking forward to going to that hockey game. I swear I had my wallet on me. - Pew, pew, pew, kaboom, pow. It looks out we outnumber you two to one, soldier! We've only let you think that so you'd put your guard down. Oh please, you're obviously just afraid that we'll annihilate you! After all, you guys are completely weak! Oh you'll see. Bring out the beast! Come on, boy, that's your cue. Boy! Earth to doggy! Behold, the ultimate killing machine! Oh no, the monster's eating everyone. Hey! Oh. I was just... Picking up my old toys. - You just moved in, didn't you? Hi, I'm Lily. - Hey, I'm Owen. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Look, it's Oliver Twist! - Hey, just 'cause Miss Do Right sticked her stupid mutt on us, we'd leave you alone? - Can't we just be cool with each other? - Cool with each other? - You don't know what cool is. - No wait, I just... - Can you even afford to buy anything? Ugh, is this what you eat on Skid Row? Aw, look at the scared little dog. - Yeah. He's just like his owner, eh? - They were made for each other. - Come on, are we done? - I don't know, are we? Hey, yo! We see you here again, we're throwing rocks, okay?! - You can only take so much, right? - What's that smell? - Hey Todd! Aw! Hey, hey you get back here! What did your boss say exactly? - She blamed it on the economy, she said that she'd lost too many clients. - A week before Christmas. - Does this woman know that you moved out here for this job? - I don't think I can do this. Maybe it was a mistake moving out here. Taking Owen out of school mid year, maybe I should just go back to Ohio and move in with mom until this gets better. - Joanne, honey, listen, we're gonna pitch in, okay? I don't wanna hear another word about it. - No, that's not the point. They're so cute. Yeah. They really like each other. - Yeah they do. - What's your dog's name? - Lucy. Listen, I saw you with Terry, Tony, and Todd. Those three are famous for picking on the new kids. We call them The Terrible T's. - I call them The Three Freakos. Besides, they weren't picking on me. I know krav maga. - Oh. - Yeah. - Who's that? Oh, I just adopted him. Aw, what's his name? - I haven't thought of one yet. - Didn't I see you playing with him in your backyard the other day? - Playing? No, I was just... Training. - That's not what I saw. - Come on, is everybody a jerk in this town? I'm so sorry, Owen. I didn't mean to be rude. I still play with my dolls. - Why are you telling me that? Come on, boy! Hey mom, I think. What's wrong? Mom? Uncle Craig? - This must be that dog I'm hearing so much about. - Owen honey, why don't you go play in your room for a little bit, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. - Money again. It's always money. - Do you have a little delinquent of a child named Owen? - Excuse me? - My son Todd was minding his own business when your bully son, maliciously and unprovoked, threw a tomato at him. - He what? - Your son engaged in a vicious, unsanitary act against my innocent and unsuspecting child. - And his dog peed on my backpack. - Owen, is this true? - Of course it's true, my little Toddy doesn't lie. This is the perfect child, he's smart, he's friendly, he's well behaved. The kind of which your little hoodlum could learn a thing or two. - I only did it because he was threatening to throw rocks at my dog. - Todd loves dogs. If he made any threats, that's because your little mutt soiled his property. I think they stole money too. 20 bucks! - I'm very sorry, could you just give us a moment? - I have filed a report with Animal Control. This neighborhood will not be terrorized. Let's get out of this bungalow. - Mom, him and his -- - I don't wanna hear it! Is this how you handle your problems? - But you -- - I have enough trouble of my own, if you can't handle your dog, he's going back to the shelter! He was only trying to help me! Maybe he could teach you a thing or two. - What did you say? You're in the dog house too, buddy. Oh boy. - I blame you. Let's go. Dog. - Let's go, let's go, drive slow, drive slow. - Hey, you're up early. - Well I wanted to take him to the park and start training. - Well how about some breakfast, I'll make you something. - Mom, I -- - I'll make your favorite, P&J sandwich. - Could you make it to go? - Sure. Hey, listen, kiddo. I'm sorry I yelled at you yesterday. Been a little stressed out lately. - It's fine, Mom. - So you decided on a name for him? - Bandit. - I think he likes it. - All right, now sit. Sit! Good boy! Stay! Now let's get to the bottom of this. See it? - Oh what a cute dog. What's his name? - It's Bandit. - Is it a real bandit? - Best I don't answer that. Max! - Bye, I have to go now. - Bye. - Hey, wait for me! Hey guys. - Hey, Lily! - Hey, boo! - What's up? - Nothing much, just hanging, you know. - Yeah. - There's Owen. Who? - You know, the guy I was telling you about. Oh! Where? - Over there playing with his cute dog. - You sure it's the dog that's cute? - Oh Krystle, don't you ever stop? - Wait, is he in our class? - No, but I think he will be after the break. - Don't I ever stop? Right, Lily. - Yeah, way to go! - You two are too much. Hi, Owen! - Oh! Hey. - Listen, I'm so sorry about the other day. I didn't mean to be rude. - That's okay, I guess it's just a lot of stuff going on. So how long have you had Lucy? - Not long. My parents got her right before they got divorced. They thought having a dog would bring them together. Still though, it's awesome having her. Seems like dogs are always there for you. - Yeah, I've always wanted one, but we never could. - How come? - My dad was... In and out of the hospital a lot. - I'm so sorry. How about I show you around? I think you're gonna like the Christmas decorations around here. - Yes, sure, but I think I should drop Bandit off at home first. - And Lucy. Shall we? Let's hit it. - Awesome. ♪ Those days when I feel the world is crumbling down ♪ Are the days I feel like knocking at your door ♪ 'Cause there's nothing like friends in December ♪ I've never had so much fun before ♪ I feel the charge when I see you ♪ And you're watching me ♪ I feel so strong when I'm near you ♪ And you talk with me ♪ Do you remember when we walked along the pier ♪ Do you remember all the things we got to do ♪ We wrote this story as we went along ♪ And I'd trade it all for another night with you ♪ So I'll pick you up tonight ♪ Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight ♪ I love all this time we spend together ♪ I don't even care if there's no snow ♪ I don't really care about the presents ♪ But I sure would like to see some mistletoe - Okay, okay, okay, that was the best day ever. - I know, that was so awesome. ♪ So I'll pick you up tonight - Okay, make sure that you don't give him anything unless he earns it. Sit, stay, something. Here. All right, good boy. - Thank you. - Hey! Hey. - I've been meaning to call you guys, I just didn't wanna give you the wrong impression. - What impression is that? - Did Owen name the dog? - That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you have a second? - Sure. What's the problem? - Okay boy, which do you want? The treat? Or the money? No, boy! You want the treat! The treat! I'm not gonna tell anything that you stole the money, but you can't do that. They're gonna take you away from me. - It takes time for a dog to get comfortable in a new home, he'll settle down. - I just think I did this for the wrong reasons, I thought it would help Owen adjust, but I'm not so sure that either of us are ready. - I know, I don't know you, I don't mean to assume anything, but it does get better. - Wow, am I really that transparent? - How about I come over one day this week, see if I can help. With the dog, help the dog. - I, wha... What did you mean earlier when you said that you didn't wanna give me the wrong impression? - Oh, I just didn't want you to... Think I was asking you out on a date. I know that you and Owen are new in town, you don't need some guy. - Do you wanna ask me out? - Yes. - On a date? - I do. Would you? Could you? - All right, we're gonna do this one more time, and we have to get it right, so which do you want? The treat, or the money? Okay boy, which do you want? The treat... Hey! Bandit! Bandit! - Every year, it's the same thing, you know? What are you talking about every year? - I tell her Jen, I know it's Christmas, I know you wanna buy something for everyone. - Yeah, it's Christmas time, man. - Things are tight and we just have to be aware of the spending. - Bandit! Bandit! - When a woman wants to spend, she's gonna spend. There's no getting around that. - Larry, please, you're not gonna lecture me on the psychology of women and Christmas shopping. - It's in their blood, it's how they're trained. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. - Are you calling my wife an old dog? That's a cute dog. Hey, buddy. - Where's his owner? - Where's your owner, huh? - Where are you, boy?! Bandit! I wonder what kind of dog it is. - Oh that's an Australian Shepard. - A what? - I know my breeds. - Oh really? Okay Caesar, what can you whisper to me about this dog? - It's the most intelligent breed on Earth. And it's -- - Larry, I'm joking! - Well you asked, man. - Come on, Shaggy. - Where's your owner? Scooby's gotta wait here. Be good. - Bandit! - Hey Larry, where's your dog? I don't know. Scooby Doo, where are you?! - Oh very funny. - Rooby Roo! Ha ha. I don't know where he went. - So what are you doing for Christmas? - I don't know, I thought I might go on a little spending spree. What do you think? - That's funny, Larry. That's really funny. Oof, ooh, ooh! - What are you doing?! Oh man. - Geez, we're gonna get fired for this! - Just help me, help me! Man! Come on! Pick it up, pick it up! I am, I am! Over there, over there, all right. - Sorry, man. - Sorry?! If anybody from the bank saw that... One, two, three, four, five, six -- - Is it all there? Did any blow away? Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! There you are! Come on, come here, boy, come on! Come on! Oh there you are. Promise me you're never gonna do that again. Come on, let's go. Hey, where are you going? This better be good. Where did this come from? Whoa. This is definitely our secret. - Owen, sweetie! - Hey, Aunt Deb. - Where are you coming from? - You know, here and there. - I think I better have a conversation with your mother about discipline, you seem to have entirely too much independence. Is she home yet? - No, not yet. - Perfect, listen, give her this, tell her it's an early Christmas present, and tell her I don't wanna hear another word about it. Did you come up with a name yet? - Bandit. - Bandit, perfect. Now he not only looks like trouble, but he sounds like it too. - Yeah. Aunt Deb, can I ask you something? - Absolutely. - Do you know when you wanna help someone, but it may not be the right way to do it? - What do you mean? - Like if you wanna help someone that you love, but they might not ask for it. - Sweetie, are you talking about me trying to help your mom? I'm sorry, it's just she is the most stubborn person that I know, she insists on doing everything by herself, I mean what is wrong with asking for a little help now and then? - Nothing, I guess. - Thank you! You are a very reasonable young man, give you Aunt Deb a hug. And don't worry. How's he doing? - He's... Earning his keep. - Hey guys, I'm Detective Decker. Just tell me what happened. - Well we were loading up the truck and we turned around and one of the bags is missing. - Larry, you really expect us to believe that? - I think a dog stole the money. - Oh geez, Albert. Detective, I'm so sorry, I -- - No, it's okay. I know this dog. Describe him for me. - He's an Australian Shepard. - Blue eyes. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Excuse me guys, I gotta make a call. - Guys, I'm sorry, man, it's just, that's crazy. - Yeah. - Who would believe that? - Thanks, Mark. Santa's saying it's ho ho hot! That's right, the only frost you'll be seeing is on the frosty lemonade you'll be drinking to cool off. Reporting from sunny Santa Monica, I'm Stacey Stevens. - Hey kiddo, what you watching? - Just the news. - Since when do you watch the news? - Seeing if anything interesting happened today. - I'm sorry, honey, what? - How's the job search? - Do you want me to be honest or polite? - That bad? Oh, mom? - Great, another credit card offer, that's just what I need. - Mom. - That reminds me, we still have to do Christmas shopping. - Mom! - What? Honey, I'm sorry, how was your day? - Aunt Deb stopped by. She wanted me to give you this. She said no ifs or buts about it. This is from Aunt Deb?! It's her card. She said you had to accept it. - We are not a charity, okay? Owen! - Maybe you should just leave it alone! - Phone! - Why can't you just let somebody help you?! - Okay, I'm gonna keep this, but just to pay bills and I'm paying Aunt Deb back after the holidays. - Come on, boy. All right, look. This is gonna be our secret. We have to return that money without getting caught because if we get caught, we go to jail. You got it? Least you'll be a thief with some bright white teeth. Come on, there, yeah. - Hey, thought you might want some... Goodnight, you two. I'm Chip Holiday. Today's top story, why one pooch may have stolen more than just table scraps. Is that right, Betty Lou? - There was some sort of a bank robbery with an armored car outside of the national bank, and guess who they're saying the suspect is. - Oh hi, guys! Hey, Owen. - Hey honey, I was thinking that maybe we could all go to the park together today. - Sure, that sounds really fun. Mom, there's something that I wanted -- - That is a cool trick! - No! - Owen, you okay? - I'm fine, I'm good, we're good, we are both very good. - Okay, so what did you wanna tell me? - Nothing, it wasn't that important. - Are you sure? - Very. - Okay, well then let's go to the park, right, let's hit it. - I would, but I... Have a date. - A date? - Yeah, a date, I'm meeting, I'm hanging out with a friend today. - Okay, I didn't know anything. - We'll talk later, come on, you guys go on and have a good time. Okay, what on Earth's gotten into you? - I just figure you guys could use some grown up fun, you know, chill, relax. - Hang on, one second. Keys. - Way to almost get ourselves busted. - Hello? - Hi, is Lily home? - Well that just depends. - Oh, right, sorry. My name's Owen, Lily's dog Lucy saved me and the Captain from some bullies. - And what sort of Captain are you mingling with, young man? - Does sound a little bit weird without any context. - Oh, oh you're the boy she saw playing with the action figures. - War was our last resort, ma'am. - Hi. - Hey. I was wondering if you'd maybe wanna go for a walk? - Can I? - Go on. Oh, Lily honey, have you got your phone? - Right here. - Okay, be careful, you two. - I'll make sure to keep her safe and unharmed. - Mommy, I killed all the bad guys. - That's nice, dear. Come on, inside. Here you go. - You know, I might get that phone. Maybe even today. - Okay. Breaking news, I'm Dick James. - And I'm Sunny Sky. - Apparently a puppy has robbed an armed vehicle. Dick, how does something like this happen? - I didn't do it! - Look at this. - Actually, the dog went behind the armed vehicle. - What is he, a free agent? - He's stealing for the kid. - That's our dog! That's our money! - There are many levels of strange. I really wouldn't worry about this. Should've seen me at his age. - I'm sure you were a piece of work. He's just been different. New town, new dog, new. - Yeah, not when something's up. Hey! - Hi, Katie. Hey Lily, how's it going? Who's your new friend? - Katie, this is Owen, he just moved into the neighborhood. - Hey Owen, how's it going? - Good, and you? - Wow, cute and polite. You should hang onto this one, Lily. He's a keeper. What can I get you guys? - Go for it, it's on me. - That's really nice, Owen. I'll have one of the small lollipops. - Make it a large and I'll have one too. - Hey big spender. I guess you don't have an older brother somewhere, do you? Seriously, compared to the dweebs in this town, you're like a regular Zac Efron. Are you buying candy?! I'll have some only if it's gluten free. - Sure, why not? Hi, Lily, hi, Owen. Oh, you're buying candy? - Can I have a Zazzle Bar? Have two. - Hey, this is the new kid, what a great guy! You're Owen, right? - Yeah? - Pretty cool. - So what's your story? Where's the girlfriend or, I don't know, wife? - I was married for eight years. - What happened, if you don't mind me asking? - Well I was a 70 hours a week investment banker making a six figure salary. My wife always wanted to know why it wasn't seven figures. - Investment banker, I don't see it. - It was not pretty. No time. Plenty of money to buy things that can't save a marriage though. - How'd you end up working with dogs? - I decided I was just gonna give away a bunch of money. Clean house, do some good at the same time. I found this shelter and I just ended up dedicating myself to it. - I never saw anyone treat so many kids to free candy before. - He's really nice. - I don't trust him, I'd be careful if I were you. Oh look, Jessie's already moving in on your territory. - So Owen, where you from? - Ohio, it's a small but pretty -- - That is so cool, you know, we should totally hang out more often. What are you doing this weekend? - Well I'm not really sure, but I was thinking -- - Yeah yeah, because there's this one time where all these food trucks line up and you can get anything you would ever want. - Oh please, Jessica. Don't you ever stop? Give us all a break! - Give me a break, Angela, it's not like you have exclusive rights to him. - I'm sorry, Jessie, but aren't you seeing Justin? I thought he was your everything. - Come on! You know Justin and I are totally incompatible. I mean he's all and stuff like that. But Owen is clearly a man of more advanced interests. - Do you guys like video games because I was thinking of going to the toy store and getting some new ones. It's on me! Whatever you want, it's on me. - I didn't know that you had so much money. - Owen? Can I get whatever I want? - Oh brother, what a user! - Don't listen to her! - Whatever you want! Are you sure you don't want anything? - I should really wait 'till Christmas. - It's up to you. - Owen? Is this really all your money? - Of course. You remember what i said about my dad not leaving us with much? Wasn't true, I just didn't wanna brag. - Is that your dog? - Yeah? - You might wanna take it easy spending the money. Or the dog's gonna get in trouble. - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah, I know. - Let's just take him right now! - With all these kids around? - Hey, aren't you the - Hey, aren't you the - one who stole our dog?! - One who stole our dog?! - Yeah! - Aww, look at this cutesy wutsy little pie, come here! - Honey, honey, be careful, they have germs and stuff. - Okay, Jen, look, that's all we can do right now, okay? I can't afford anything else, not with my job on the line. - Oh they're not gonna fire you. - Jen, everyone thinks I'm nuts! - Oh Albert, you're overreacting, I mean just because you claim that a shaggy dog robbed you, it doesn't mean they're gonna fire you. They may put you in the dog house, but they're not gonna fire you. - Cute, Jen, you're so funny, you're so funny. - Oh I know, I'm very funny. - That's him. - Oh, no no, No, Jen, that's the dog! - No, Albert, not again. - No, no, that's him, that's the dog! Stop, wait, stop! That's the dog! That's the, is this your dog? - Sir, I'm not -- - Security! Security! - Hey hey hey, what's the problem? - That dog, he -- - What about the dog? - That dog robbed my truck! - My necklace is gone! He has my wife's necklace. Run! - Get him, get the dog! - Are we gonna follow them? - I know where he's going. - I'll go get the van. - That's the dog that stole my cup! Hey, did he steal your cup too? I want my other cup back. Hey, did you see a boy with a dog? - Yeah, he's been stealing from me! - That's our dog, all right?! - Your dog?! Well you owe me some money! - What'd you say?! - You heard me! Hey, where you going? Aw, don't leave a brother hanging, man! All right, that's a long drop. - Well maybe next time we do the park. - Oh yeah, setting up date number two? - Well I work fast. And I want Owen to keep his dog. - I have to admit, they make a pretty cute team. - I had a good time. - Yeah, me too. Hi. - Way to kill the moment, buddy. Lousy dog! Get the dog! - Looks like a circus here. Oh boy. - The cops are coming, let's go, let's go, drive slow, drive slow! - You stole the money! Fix him,! - Hang on, well we're definitely, we're working on it, I promise you -- - Ours too, I was here first! - I know you were, okay, but see, everyone, well okay, excuse me -- - You don't know understand, this is the dog that's robbed the bank! - I can't, I promise you we're working on this. - This is The Bandit Hound! - I know, and believe me, it's our main priority right now, okay? I just everyone to calm down, we have to fill out reports. You know what, here's what you do, do me a huge favor, step right over there, I promise this is priority and I will take care of it immediately, just step right over there please. - They're probably gonna make us wait another hour now. - I told you having a dog would be too much right now, but no one listens to me. - Oh Chief, oh Chief, this is wreaking havoc. - What? - That dog, that Bandit. - Oh the dog. - Yeah, stealing from the bank, purses, homes. Women are setting their purses down at a restaurant and the dog is taking their wallets out of the purse, they're going crazy. Mom, I -- - No. - So listen, all you gotta do is tell them the Chief is on it personally, he's very upset about this dog, he's gonna do something right away. - Just slam your first down when you're leaving. Son of a gun! - Yes, sir, yes, sir. - I don't wanna take any no for an answer here, I want you on it, do you understand?! - Yes Chief, thank you, I will get to it right away. - Somebody's gonna get fired around here if this is not taken care of! - Priority. - All right. Chief Burton, sir, I... I don't know what to say, I'm so sorry. - Well the lady got her necklace back, I think we're okay. Animal Control is on its way. - What?! - What?! - Sorry, why? - To take the dog to the pound. This is not the first time this animal has been involved in a problem, something about harassing two boys? - Three, and they were bothering us. - Well there's a Mr. Dyer outside who says that this dog stole a bag of money out of his armored truck. - Oh come on! Sorry. - You know anything about this, Miss Boit? - We're talking about a dog here. - Son, is there anything that you want to tell me? - Most of it is still here. - I am so sorry. I was only trying to help, mom! - The thing is, Mrs. Boit, this isn't the first time that this dog has been involved in a crime. We ran his microchip and six months ago he was involved in a bank robbery. His owners got away, but they took the dog to the pound. - Did the rescue shelter know anything about this? - Joanne, I know nothing about this. - What happens now? - Animal Control will take him to the pound and he'll be put down. - No, you can't! - There's gotta be something that we can do, repay the money. - We can't have a dog like this running loose. - Chief Burton, please, it's almost Christmas. Please. - I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, boy. I didn't mean to get you into trouble. - Came to check on you, you okay? - Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about. - Mind if I talk to him? - Sure. - Mind if I come in, pal? Kind of a rough day, huh? Sometimes when we try to help, we mess up. - He was doing it for me. - It's not your fault. - All my stupid talk about money. - Well look, I know nobody can replace him, but if your mom is up for it, maybe we can look at some other dogs on Saturday. - I don't want another dog. ♪ But I know we feel it's always buried ♪ We could soar the places we've never known ♪ I miss you like the grass needs rain ♪ I miss you on ever refrain ♪ You were always in the background ♪ Of the greatest of songs ♪ See, I've always really missed you all along ♪ Can't you see I really miss you all along ♪ Toothbrush, change of clothes, two pairs of socks.

I don't know, I hear Alaska's beautiful this time of year. - Sounds like a very well thought out plan. - I'm going. - How are you gonna stop them? - I don't know, but I have to go, they're gonna kill my dog. Now please -- - Wait a sec. - Look, I don't care if we have to talk about this all night, but I'm going! - I said wait a sec! - What?! - That's it. Good luck. - Thanks. - What? Mmmhm, wine. Okay. Sorry, chocolates? Sure. Me too. Right. Right. - I'll be honest, I'm not really sure where we're going. - You don't give up, do you? I'm taking my dog now, thank you. - Help! Let me go! All right, kid, where's the money? I turned it in. - You going somewhere? Are you running from home? Well we got Bandit back. - Wait, you named him Bandit? - Yeah, why? - I named him Bandit! - Well that's what he is. - You guys taught him to do this stuff. To steal things from people! - Enough with the lectures, I saw you spend money you knew was stolen. What are we gonna do about this? He can finger the two of us. He could sing like a canary. - It's just you and your mom that live in that house, right? - I just don't want anyone to get hurt. Then keep your mouth shut. - We got Bandit back, we're back in the bank business. - So tomorrow, first thing, Bandit and I hit a bank, you wait here. - This is my score! I picked out the bank and everything! - But someone's gotta wait with the kid. - Not if we... - Really? We're not gonna kill him. Just wait until I get back. - How are we gonna do this? Who's gonna let Bandit out of the car? The whole routine's messed up. - Plan B. - Plan B? - Owen, honey. You can't lay in bed all day. Owen? Owen?! - It's just me and you, boy. - Oh, I'm sorry sir. Can't allow dogs inside the bank. - He's my eyes. - Of course, I didn't... - Can you direct me to the manager? - Yes, sir. Mr. Robely, sir? This gentleman would like to speak with you. Mr. Robely? - Can't you see I'm... Oh I'm sorry, I didn't see you. I mean how can we help you? - Start by opening up the safe. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. - He's got a bomb! - Oh my God! - What'd he say?! - A bomb! - A what?! A palm?! - A bomb! - A bomb?! - Ladies. You're gonna bring my partner into the safe. You're gonna open a bag for him. Go get the money. Go! What's all this fuss about dogs? What about raccoons? Maybe more people should have raccoons as pets. - I gotta tell you something. Don't tell me you gotta go to the bathroom. - I didn't turn all the money in to the police. I buried it. The way I see it, there's two ways that this can go. One, you can miss out on it. Two, I can show you where it is. - Look, I like you, kid, but you're a terrible liar, now shut up! - I just bought this dress! - Shut up with your dress, who cares about your dress! - I hope you know what you're doing is very bad! - Happy holidays. - Dog. - Oh my God, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, no, get up, get up, get up. I should've used the ATM. - Whoa whoa whoa, no fast movement. - Sorry. - What have you got there? - It's just a stupid little -- - Is that an Action Man? Man, I used to have one of these. You ever think about putting one of these in a microwave? Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, easy, easy. - We are going to the police! You are gonna tell them you guys trained my dog to steal! - Tell me something, you think the cops are gonna care who trained the stupid dog? You think that's funny?! You think that's funny?! - No! What have you done? What have you done to my dog?! We gotta help him! - Here, keep this, put pressure on the wound, okay? - Pressure on the wound. - Bandit will be fine, okay? - It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine. - Let's go, get up! I didn't do it! - I know, I know, the police are coming, let's go, get up, get up! - Hold on, boy. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - You believe this? It's that dog again. Come on. - Help him! He's hurt! - You shot my dog. - At least we got the money! What is this? Oh boy. - That's a smart dog. - Owen? Owen? You awake? - I'm up, I'm up.
