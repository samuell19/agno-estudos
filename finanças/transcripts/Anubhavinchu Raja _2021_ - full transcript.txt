[old classic playing on stereo] [no posters allowed] [hail Yuva Samrat Nagarjuna] Are you kidding us! You didn't even sell a single ticket... How can you put up a 'House-full' board! Did you sell off the tickets in black? Yes, sir. Someone booked the entire hall for today. Who's such a bigshot in our village! YANDAGANDI 0KMS This is our village... Yandagandi. Don't judge me by the looks of my old rusty bicycle. All the land and fields that you can see around are ours. All that you can't see... belong to the villagers. This is our house. The villagers call it 'The Mansion'. He is the one who owns this mansion. My grandpa, Sr. Bangaru Raju. Oh, I didn't tell you my name, right? I was named after my grandpa. But out of love, people call me... Bangaram (gold), wash your hands and legs before you come in. [counting] -Dad... -Shh! -Here. -Profit from the fish business, sir. They say that money keeps changing hands. But even if generations change... The money we own just kept growing that we couldn't even store it properly. [beggar asking for money] Raju sir... Help me with some money. Sir! Donate me one rupee and you'll have a good fate. See, I get free good fate by praying to God. No need to buy it from you. Get lost! Grandpa, it's just a rupee, right? Why don't you donate? A rupee is like a baby. You should take care of it and double it. Never hand it to someone else. Remember this... The rich lives and dies. The poor die not being able to live. Understood? Get in. This won't work! -Dad! -What? The car got really old. -Nothing works in here. -Bangaram... You are a kid when they bought this car and now you have grandkids. Let's buy a new car, dad. Listen... To spend money on something... I need to have a profit of at least 10 paisa, or an interest of 5 paisa. But it should never get spent. Let's go. Sorry, President sir... No one made it. Bangaru Raju sir is breathing his last. What's the use of all the money? The entire family died at once. Just money won't cut it. You need to have luck to enjoy that money. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Get up, Grandpa! Grandpa! Don't cry. You should never cry. All my life I just kept earning money. Now I was left with just that money and no memories. Life is not about earning... It's about enjoyment. I get it only when I'm on my deathbed... From now on, don't miss us. Don't be scared of anything. Enjoy! Just enjoy... Keep enjoying... ['Mass' by DSP playing] It's a super hit! Hit it! His grandfather earned till his last breath. Now he'll enjoy it until his last. He's just a kid right now. Imagine what happens when he grows up! ['Devuda' by Anup Rubens playing] -What! -I couldn't see, brother. Brother, please move a little. Hey, sit! -Brother... -What? -I couldn't see... -Get lost! Please don't mind, brother. Please, brother... Thanks! Watch. Hey, wait for me... Let's eat together. Ok - Ok. Can I have some dhal i? That's what it is. Hey, keep moving. What are you looking at? Wash! Look at my life! -Raju... -Tell me, uncle. Jailer sir is calling you. Let's go. [chatter] Namasthe, sir. Listen Suri Babu, today Chennai is my favorite. I have already got a tip. Bet a 50 on my name. Just do it. I'll take care of the rest. Sir... What's this? At your age, you have to come in on a betting or a teasing case... What's with this case? You made bail. Go. Go on. Hey... If you think you can do anything with the support of your ancestral property... This is how life gets toppled. Automatically! Get lost. Bye, sir. -Good morning, sir. -What? Belt, sir. -I had a belt on already! -Not that belt, sir. Seat belt. Why do you keep blabbering rules all the time? What can we do, sir? We do what the company order us to do. -You guys have to cooperate, sir. -Of course, we will. Open the gate. -No, sir. I can't... -Hey, what happened ya? One minute, madam. What else can I do! Open open. Madam madam madam... Sorry, madam! No helmet. No entry. New rules, madam. It took me 30 minutes to straighten my hair. How can you ask me to wear a helmet now? Open the gate. -Nice hairstyle, madam. -Thanks! But... No helmet. No entry. -Keep it. -CC cameras! -Keep it... -Sorry, madam! He's just a security guard, but thinks that he's a policeman! Look at his silly face! -Ok? -Thank you, madam. Don't overact! Open the damn gate. Please go! God! Coffee. Thanks. I got so angry that... I could have killed him! I hate security guards. Forget it. Also, why do you hate curly hair so much? I hate noodles! What happened with the work you went on? I like that one guy from the entire list. Everything matched between us. Same to same. -Congrats! -Thanks! -Name? -Prem. -Age. -Same. -Colour? -Same. -Height? -Same. -Package? -Of course, same! Also, why are you asking me all this? To have everything same to same... Are you buying a matching blouse for a saree or what? Mismatch is the new trend. I didn't get you. The guy we marry should always be a little bit more... ...in height, weight, colour, and everything else. What's with this strange calculation? If we can't reach something... he should help us romantically. If we are too tired to climb the temple steps, he should carry us. Not just our weight... He should carry our head weight too. He should buy proper properties, and register them under our name. He has to be a king. But it has to be us who sits on the throne. He's calling... Answer it. Put it on speaker. Hi, I just spoke with your mom. She said even you too don't like coffee. You know what? Me too. Same to same. -What? 'Same to same'? -Yeah. -Don't call me again. I'll kill you. -Hey! Are you sure? Will all these calculation about life workout? Life is all about calculations. And I... am never wrong about it. [drill commands] Front salute! [drill commands continues] You pig! You have to step onto that side. Move! -See who's calling me a pig. -Shut up and move! Congratulations to the new batch that completed their training. Security doesn't mean saluting the owner when he comes... And lighting a smoke right after he leaves. Or taking a nice nap when no one is watching. None of these are going to happen. Forget about sleep. Forget about being lazy. You have to observe everything in your eye-line. Dude, you can't even see me, who's right next to you. How can this work! Soldiers are the country's security. Police are the state security. Temples, schools, cinema halls, shopping malls... From banks to ATM centers... Our security is the security for everything else. Even the police might arrive late to the spot, but... Security appears out of nowhere with just a call, 'Security'! Senior citizens will take care of ATMs. Come to this side. Senior citizens... Damn! Middle-aged ones will take care of cinema halls and shopping malls. This side. God! Don't stare at me like that... I look above my age. Your young batch will guard IDM software company. I'll keep watching you through the CCTV all the time. [everyone salutes] -Hi. -Hi, sir. -Darshan... Sudarshan, from Nellore. -Raju, sir. From Godavari distircts, right? I didn't get a job that suits my qualification. But the place suits my age. Yes! Why are you so excited? Hey, it's the software. Hi-fi world and Wi-fi settings. It's like a branch office of the heavens. Hey, it doesn't matter if it's the head office or a branch office... We only stand outside the gate. Remember that. I'm not like everyone else. Sir, this is a no-smoking zone. You can't smoke here. Who the hell are you tell me? Don't I know what a non-smoking zone is? Every Tom Dick and Harry tells us what to do! Get the hell out of here. My manager is already eating my brains. Now, this security guard joins in. Damn it! Are you feeling bad for what he said? What did I even say? Why is he getting frustrated? He's far better. The other block guy slapped me across my face. He hit hard! God! I thought software employees will be soft. How can they be this hard! -How did the duty feel? -[all]: Too hard, sir. -But you have to work hard, right? -Ok, sir. -Sir. -Sir. -Are you feeling bad? -Sir, that's... See, they don't have any personal anger on us. The head in America shouts on the local head here. The local head shouts on these people. They blow that frustration away through a cigarette. If you poke them at that time, they will shout at us. If you like someone, make friends with them. If you don't like someone, just compromise. But somehow... Of course, the entire mistake is mine! My first biggest mistake is marrying you. Second, doing this job. The mistake is not yours or my boss's... It's mine! Mine! Hell with my life! Oh God! Damn it... It's still on EMI! Can't even repair it! Dude... Wanna have some tea? -No. -Coffee? No! New dress... Oh my God! You look stunning! New dress you say? Not just new... They are branded too. I bought them with my one-month salary. US Pola! Is it that necessary now? I'm here just because of bad time. Or else, my range is different! Security guard job is already too much for our qualification. Let me put the glass back. He's not at all sharp! Don't know how he'll survive. US Pola! What? It looks great, right? US Pola! Hey, you are too young to know all this. I'll put this up for matchmaking. [both]: Fasak! Bye... You kids... Sorry, sir! What 'Sorry'? Huh? What? Kids, old people, people with clothes roam on the roads. You'll also find people like me who use only branded clothes! -You have to be careful, right? -Sir, I'm getting late for the office. -I'm in that hurry, sir. -I don't care. -RC, license, and sloution or revolution! -Sir... -Pollution? -Yeah, pollution. Show me all the papers. I told you to take the main road. See what happened! Shut up! US Pola got spoiled here. You show me all the papers... RC, license... Sir, I don't have all that. I have an ID though. Do you think that this bloody IDM card can save you? 'Bloody IDM'? It's our IDM, dude. Even we work with IDM. So what? We work for the same company. Let it go. How can I let it go just because we work for the same company? Did you forget what they said on the first day of our duty? Not even an ant should enter the premises without our permission. I'm leaving you on the basis of working for the same company. Professional ethics. You can go. -Thanks! -It's ok. I get dirt and he gets thanks! Stop it. See, he felt so bad just for the dirt that spilled on him. What if you fall into the dirty? That's why the helmet shouldn't be here... It has to be here. Have a happy ride. -Thank you. -It's ok. Bye! I forgot to tell you... Your dress looks great. Let's go have some tea? Stop acting smart and move. Namasthe, sir. You shouldn't miss the target at any cost. You don't worry about it, sir. I'll take care of it. You leave in peace. Manikyam... Here... Brother, we got a deal. They are contract killers. Like people who deliver us our daily needs... These people deliver our vengeance. Ghani and gang! They lead a normal life, as if they are not related at all. But they all meet when a deal comes. With the revenge of the one who pays... Or with the emotions of the one who dies... They have nothing to do. Once they get paid, they will kill anyone, anywhere. They won't speak of me if they get caught, right? Even if it comes down to their life or death... They won't give your name. Don't take tension, sir. Chill! [both]: Cheers! -Hello! -Where are you? I'm not feeling well. I'm going back to our room. You get the bike. Ok, bye. Why are you taking this route? You have to go the other way, right? Madam, you booked a share cab. Oh damn! I was in a hurry! I'll pay you the entire amount. Drop me first, please. Sorry, madam. I took the booking already. We are already at the location, madam. Sir, I'm at the location. Where are you? -I'm also here. -Please get in, sir. Give me the OTP, sir. 3-5-6-9. Wear the seat belt. Safety! Let's go? Hey... Hi! -Do you remember me? -Of course, yes. How can I forget someone who works in the same company as mine? -Shruthi. -Raju. And so starts the flirting! Ah, you said you work for IDM, right? But I never saw you in the office premises! Yeah... Even you never passed by me. -Mine is the night shift. Yours? -Day shift. Software solutions architect. Working on AI. How about you? Did they promise you an extra salary for talking in English even out of office? Sir! So even you don't know English like me, is it? What are you talking? Do you think I don't know English? You can't handle my English. I in parking, sir. Second floor coming, sir. Over, sir. Sir, I'm lift, sir. Upcoming, sir. Just one minute, sir. Over. Not because I don't know how to talk in English... Talking in Telugu feels like we are playing. But talking in English feels like fighting! We can't escape it in the office anyways, right? [in English]:Yeah yeah... [in Telugu]: Yes yes. You told us everything, except what you do. Security. Data security or system security? Not just one... I'm the security for everything. Madam, we are at your location. -Ok, Raj. Bye. -Bye. -What's the bill amount? -150, madam. -I don't have change for 2000, madam. -PTM? See if you can pay in cash, madam. I have to go to my village for this festival. Cash! Shruthi, I'll pay. Don't worry. No no, it's ok. I don't want to trouble you. What's the trouble in it? We work for the same company. You can pay me back later. Chill! -Flirt! -Ok. -Bye. -Bye! -Let's go. -Do you have cash with you, sir? I do. I'll pay for both and you are going to your village for this festival. -Move... Right right... -Ok ok. Good morning... Hyderabad! The city that echoes with traffic honkings all day... Went silent with no traffic on the roads. No people in the malls... A tensed Hyderabad went silent all at once. Because there are just two days left for Sankranti. See how peaceful the roads are. Hyderabad will be at peace for these three days. -Good evening, uncle. -Namasthe. Sign for me too. I'll go have some tea. What, uncle... Is sir here? Why do you look so dull? I'm here to ask for a leave for the festival, brother. -I don't know if he'll approve. -As if the festival will stop without you. Our place is where we live, that's it. Celebrate the festival here and you'll save the travel expenses. Hey, enough with your nonsense! Festival doesn't mean buying new clothes and gold. It's about being happy with our people, in our village. I don't know how much you'll save on the travel expenses... But if you do go, it will send you back with invaluable memories. Where we stay is not our place. The one we took birth in, that's our place. Here, I approved your leave for one week. Go. Thank you, uncle. What about my duty? -He'll do OT (Over Time). -Uncle! All this is because of you. Uncle... I'm not Rajinikanth Robo to work around the clock. Approve leave for me too. I'll go home. -Nagendra... -Brother? -Keep it. -No, brother. It's ok, keep it. You shouldn't go empty handed to your village. Thank you, brother. Bye. -Hello! -Hey, where are you? I'm at In-Orbit mall. I'll talk to you later. Bye! You keep selecting. I'll just come. Wow wow wow! Very nice, madam! Madam, heroine... You look like heroine Pooja Hegde. Madam, take it. Hey, how's this? Put on two more stones and you'll lose your neck. Hey, sorry! I thought you are my friend. It's ok. It suited you. Take it. Thank you! -How much is this? -300 rupees, madam. Ah, can you give it for 150? Will you bargain at the In-Orbot mall, madam? Just 150 more, right? Take it. Here. Everyone pays with 2000 note. Where can we get change from? It's ok, I'll pay. No no, it's ok. I'll ask my friend to... Even I am like a friend to you, right? We work for the same company. This is quite common. You can pay me back anytime. No issues. Here. Let's go? -So a total of 450 rupees, ok? -Madam... -It's ok. -Madam, please come. Hey, these guys are famous for Irani tea. -Let's have some? -Ok. Shruthi... -Tea. -Oh, sorry. Does it look good? It looks exactly like you bought it at In-Orbit mall. -It looks great. -Thanks! Also, why did you come to Old City without shopping in Hitech City? Today is my week off. What about you? We don't have that convenience. We have to work OT for leaves. Yeah yeah, security is really important for the company! Yeah. Where are you? I'm in a cafe close by. I'm coming home. No matter how careful we are, hackers keep hacking... How will you protect the firewall then? Not just the firewall, we take really good care of every compound wall. We can't give away some secrets. Professional ethics. -Yeah yeah... -30 rupees. I'll pay. It's ok. Please don't take out that 2000 note. The total is 480 now. I told you to book a cab. We would have happily gone home in a car. Cab 150... Tea 30. Jewelry 300. -What's the total? -Hey, what's with your nonsense? Seems like all my high will fly off! Seems like a movie shooting. Shall we go see? That's not shooting... That's a drunk and drive test. -Blow... -Move! -Hey stop... Blow into the meter. -Hey, SI! -Hey, SI! -Sir... Is it? Wow! You said stop and he did. Nice act! So do I need to get scared now? Sir, I'm scared, sir. -Do you know who I am? -No! Do you know who my brother is? No again! You don't know me, or my brother... But you stopped me in the middle of the road! Hello! Do you even know the spelling of 'Government'? -No. -No! Do you know the spelling of 'Psychology'? -No. -No! You know nothing. You know nothing except eating government salaries. Do you know how to blow? Hello! I'm an expert in it. Then go on. 200. Double century. You surpassed Virat Kohli! You fool, what did you just say? Do you know my brother, my sister! Who the hell are they? The right destination for you is jail. Take him away. -Come on. -Next! Hey, I have a doubt. Who's more beautiful, you or me? The answer is obvious, right? It's me. Right... Take the bike once. You are already a beauty! And I am just an average-looking girl. It's ok. If I get caught, I have to sit at home all my life. But you don't have that problem, right? Bye! Hey, where are you running off to? Rascal! Someone will marry you even after this. Hey, that's Shruthi... God, please save me. I'll never drink again in my life. Please! Blow... -I'm talking to you... -One minute. -Hey! -One minute, sir. What is this Shruthi? How can you come out of home, just for this? What will people think of us? What's that 'Just for this'? I need to know. We work in the same office, sir. We were in love for two years, and got married against our parents' wish. This is just a small thing, right? She works on day shift and I work on the night shift. We are together only for two days in the entire week, sir. That's why I asked her if we should cook at home or order from Swiggy. Wow! A husband should be like you. What's your problem then? As we eat outside all week, she said let's have home food and even cooked, sir. A wife should be like you. What's your problem then? I said the food is little salty... That's it. She came on to the roads just for that, sir! Hey, man... That's not a small thing at all. It's a huge thing! You come with me, I'll explain. Come. Brother, girls these days don't even cook, but she did. You just have to eat it silently, not criticize it. Your generation has no idea how to manage a wife! See, even if she cooks bad, you have to like it for sure. Even if you hate it, you have to tell her that it tastes great. Do you think a 'wife' will ever look good? Still... we have to tell her that she's a universal beauty. God created women and women created lies. Hey, do you get what I'm trying to say? Sir, you enlightened me, sir! Just a minute. Sorry, Shruthi. I thought it's your mistake that the food got salty. I failed to realize that it's the salt's mistake. Forgive me. -Super! -Move back silently. Thank you, sir. Stop it! Blow. Oh! No one can fool me. Thank you, sir. -All the best. -Hey hey hey! So you made it! I was just looking for you in the news. 'A girl, fully drunk, made a scene on the road'. I thought you'll trend on YouTube with this line. How did you make it out? Forget about that... I'll do it now. -What? Where are you going? -Trending! 'A girl, fully drunk, kills her friend'. -No no, Shruthi... Let her go. -I'll kill you! -How dare you to do this to me? -Let her go. You get inside... Go! -I'll kill you! -Shruthi, let her go. Listen to me! -I have to kill her. -Shruthi, listen to me. Let her go. -Please, listen to me. No! -Raju sir... Raju sir... I let her go... You better let ME go! Damn! Sorry, Shruthi. Sorry! Saying that you are my wife and holding you by your waist... It's just because of the situations. I don't mean them. Sorry again! -Ok, bye. Goodnight! -Raj... Your bag... Sorry. Ok, bye. Goodnight! -Raj! -Tell me... Tea 30... Cab 150... Jewelry 300... -What's the total? -480! Will you pay now? Yeah, I will. I will... -Let's deal with this later. -No, I will. It's ok. -Listen to me, Shruthi. -Here, take it. I think she won't stop using that note until it gets banned. Tell me your number, I'll GPay you. -It's ok, Shruthi... Let it go. -No no, give me your number. You fool... She's asking for your number indirectly. -What! -Ah... 98480... **** -Ok, bye. Goodnight! -You can call anytime. Move! Raj... Soma Raj! Traditional brand you know. You look like a well-decorated buffalo! -You should have given me ten more minutes. -It's ok, calm down. -I would have straightened my hair. -They might be waiting for us. -Hi! -Hello. Hi. Let's go. Don't mind me saying this... Rather than that silly straightened hair, these curls look more natural. Thank you. -How are you, son? -Uncle, I'm good. -Why are you standing in the line? -It's ok. Hey, come on. It's ok, come on. We have people everywhere. Let's go. Brother tea. Some uncle asked me to hand this to you. -What's this? -I don't know. -Who gave you this? Hey... -Yadagiri's man it seems. -Hello! -I'll pay you in full once the job is done. This is just an advance. Your plan shouldn't miss! Maybe ordering a kill is new to you. Making a kill is not new to us! -Hello! Tell me... -What? Who the hell is he? Did you like him? It's an America match. If you like him, he'll come to see you in 3 days and will marry you in a week. If everything goes well, you will be flying to America within a month. Your dad asked me to call you home at once. Mom, are you kidding me? Did you look at his face at all? Yaak! I already told you that don't want to get married now, right? Then when will you get married if not now? Tell me if there is something. Or else you'll blame me later. And then I can't help you. Mom, you are so intelligent! I'll send you his photo. Please convince dad somehow. -I was just saying! Who is he? -Ok... Bye bye! Forget convincing your parents. First, tell him about your feelings. Don't you think he'll express first? If that's the case, he should already have done that. So... It's better you tell him. Have you gone mad? -He's calling. -Answer. -Hello! -Hello... What's with the missed call, Shruthi? Sorry, I called you by mistake. Are you free this evening? -Shall we meet? -Sorry! I am so busy today. I am organizing the office function tonight. Hey, keep that board there. Oh, I almost forgot. Ok, shall we meet at the function this evening? -Ok. Bye. -Bye. -So you are proposing to him, right? -I have to, right? [Rang de basanti by A.R. Rahman playing] [Jiya Jale by A.R. Rahman playing] [Nagada by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Monty Sharma playing] Hope you all enjoyed the show. Next segment, annual awards. Regarding this, I would like to call upon... Mr. Sanjeev Guptha, the director and business head of IDM solutions. Welcome, sir. Welcome! Hi. And next, Suresh... Vice President, HR. Please come onto the dias. Ladies and gentlemen, give a big round of applause. Thank you, sir. Please come, sir. What's the matter? Here is the list of the awards... The best project of the year goes to Mr. Sanghamitra. Claps! Congratulations! Couldn't reach him on phone. Don't know where he is! The best team of the year goes to Logistics. Please come onto the dias. Claps! Why didn't you tell us all these days? What department he is in? The best security of the year goes to, Mr. Raju. Please welcome. Come onto the dias. -Forget telling... Come I'll show him. -Is it? Hey, Raju... Come on. Please come. Just as we respect the army, who guards our borders. We should also respect the security... Who guards us at our company. Did you see? She even changed her hairstyle! Yeah. Hey, security! You are awesome! People love security in life. But you fell in love with a security guard himself. Great! Hey, don't make fun of her. This is a very big advantage. To get into the temple... Or to get tickets at a theater... We need not stand in the lines at all! One phone call to her and everything comes free... free... free! You talked about height, weight... and the boy should be at heights! It's true! Your calculation will never miss. You won't follow the trend. You'll set it. Your mom is calling. Answer it and put it on speaker. -Mom, tell me. -There's nothing to say. Your dad saw his photo and decided that your calculation won't miss. He even calcelled the America match. -Bring my son-in-law home. -Mom, I'll call you back! Stop it guys! I can't take this anymore. Shruthi... Shruthi... I have been trying to tell you something but couldn't reach you on call. You didn't even attend the function. Ok... Have some sweet. Go on. I got the best employee award. They moved me to the day shift too. I even got a salary hike. We can meet in the office everyday. No need to meet outside. You said that you have to tell me something, right? Go on. Go on... tell him. Tell him. Tell me... What are you thinking about? I owe you money, right? Here you go. Do we need all these formalities now? It's ok. Don't try to act smart, just because I'm letting you close. Take it. What happened? You don't feel bad, dude. All the girls are the same. We can never imagine what they'll do or say next. What's wrong with what she said? We should have stayed within our limits. You can't be this soft! -Can't you see the No-Entry board? -But, brother... -Move! -Open it up a little... -Move! -Hey, let's go back. -How can you stop us at both ends? -Get lost! Move! -Where should we go from? Huh? -Dude, listen to me. Stop! -Don't stop me. -Can't you see? -As if this road belongs to your dad! -Just get lost! How dare you touch me? [commotion] -Move your bike. -Brother, please! -Hey, don't touch me! -Dude, let's go. Raju... What the hell! Hey, sorry! Let's get out of here. Raju, leave them. Brother, please! Raju, let's go. Dude, come on. Fast! Come on... Dude, come on! -Get on... -Move! Fast! Drive faster. -Move! -Stop! -They are here, drive fast. -Hey! Let's go... -Rama, did you see my ID card? -No, madam. Where did I keep it? Where did I keep it? God! Are you not coming to the office today also? I'm in a bad mood. I'm not coming! How many more leaves will you take? If I do come, I have to face him! I can't do that. He cheated me! Hey, get up. What did you say? Do you think he cheated you? If he really wanted to cheat you... He would never have asked you to meet in the office. And he would have never let you see him in a security uniform. He had always been the same. I feel like it's you who's misunderstanding him. -Madam, your ID card is here. -Yeah, I'm coming. Ok, I'm going to the office. Bye! 'Bloody IDM'? Our IDM. Even we work for IDM. Data security or system security? Not just one... I'm the security for everything. How will you protect the firewall then? Not just the firewall, we take really good care of every compound wall. Straight hair doesn't suit you. These curls look more natural. -Hello! -Sudharshan, where are you guys? Where else we would be at this time? On duty. I couldn't reach Raj on call. He's in the cellar. The signals are weak there. -Is it? Ok, I'm coming. -Ok. We thought he's just a security guard and so it would be an easy job. We didn't expect this! The postmortem is done... Sign here and take the body. Brother, the one who gave us the job is calling. You failed to kill just a security guard. What do you even need payment for? Of course, it's my mistake that I trusted fools like you. Who the hell are you? Damn it! Why do you even care? Advice to a man who don't know how to live. Payment to a fool like you, who can't make a kill. Both are mere waste. If you are that capable, finish the job and call me back. Hey... -What are you doing here? -What are YOU doing here? I'm talking with my friend. Let's go. Don't try to cover it up. I heard everything. So it means they deliberately fought with us last night, right? I don't understand! Tell me the truth. He have to come searching for me, right? Who gave us a job to kill him? I gave them a job to kill me. This is just an advance. The plan shouldn't miss. And I'm the one who killed him last night. All that you have seen and all that you have heard... is true! 2 YEARS AGO YANDAGANDI (BHIMAVARAM) To all the gamblers who are here at Yandagandi cockfights... This is our hearty welcome! The bets are about to begin soon. Be ready with your money in your hands. Don't feel bad if you lose. Rayudu sir is ready backstage to sanction gold loans. Credit and debit card machine is also available. The real match is about to start. Ammiraju sir's Falcon... And Rambabu sir's Hawk. The bet is for 5 lakh rupees! Don't know what's gonna happen. Hey, whoever wants to bet, go ahead. Don't create a scene here. Hey, move back. Mustache Raju sir! Where are you? The public is coming into the ring. Make a round! -Move! Back you go! Come on! -That's it! Hit them... -You... -Stop! Take a look before you take a hit. -Ok, sir! I will... -God, no! There they tie the knife. Make your bets... How much? -10k. -10k? 25k is the minimum bet. Get lost. Only when our eyes are on our Falcon while we tie the knife... Our Falcon's eyes will be on the opponent when he uses it. Mustache Raju sir... Move! Oh God! Look at the Falcon take a hit. Ammiraju sir's Falcon and Appalaraju sir's Eagle... It's a tight match! Hit it! Wow! Look at Ammiraju sir's Falcon fight. Ammiraju sir's Falcon is unstoppable with back-to-back victories. Clap for it. Now we take a small break. Those who want to drink, go drink. Those who want to eat, go eat. The king of all kings... That's our Ammiraju sir! i You are a lion in the ring. i A plam tree that grew out of a pond... That's how high you are. i You are as strong as the banyan tree. i Why don't you bless us with something to drink? i Why don't you give a go ahead for some liquor. i I can't buy his love with money. Keep this. That's why you should just act... Don't overact! It understood that winning is all about killing the opponent. -My hero! -That's it. Come on... Are there any more cocks ready to die in the village. If so... send them in. [old ANR classic playing] Tell me, Kasi... Bangaram sir... We just got the harvest. We got 25 kilos per ward. I'll give you the total count once I get home, sir. 25 kilos per ward means... A count of 40 per kilo will give us 1 lakh per acre. 1 lakh means approximately 2.5 tonnes per acre. So it will add up to 62.5 tonnes for 25 acres. Let's say 4 lakhs per tonne on an average... So the total will be 2.5 crores. Why do you have to go home just for this? First of all, close your mouth... Pick up the shrimp that's jumping on the bank and throw it into the pond. Hey, we are getting late for the match. Where is my Black Peacock? God! It has to be somewhere around here. Don't know where it went! Maybe it went behind a hen! Let's go search. Yes, sir. Coming. Where did it go? It's roaming cluelessly, just like you. I'll slap you across your face. I heard it! You go that side and I'll go this way. Go! Damn! Here I come... ['Vachinde' from Fidaa playing] [singing along] Here I come... As slow as a thief... i I made sure that no one is around... i I'm here for you... i -What are you doing here? -I made sure no one is watching. Who asked you to come? Leave! Get out... As if someone has to invite me seperately... Also, the cock always follows the hen, right? My cock followed your hen and I followed my cock. Oh, God! Of course, I believe you. Let's talk facts... You look ravishing! You've changed a lot. Do you know that? So beautiful! -Idiot! -What happened? You haven't changed a bit. The same flirting with every girl you come across. Why don't you get married to a nice girl? 'Nice girl', is fine... What's with the 'Marriage'? This Bangaram's heart is like a cinema hall... The reels keep changing by the week. Nothing plays permanently. God! Enough of your silly punches. Take your cock and get lost. Go! That's it? Nothing else to say? If I ever find your cock following my hen... I'll skin it... Cook it... And will eat it. What? Don't you have a little shame? Whatever you say... A hen has to lay an egg. And a cock... has to win the match. Get lost! Here starts the real match. A bet of 10 lakh rupees. Bangaram sir's Black Peacock... And Ammiraju sir's Falcon. With one hit from Ammiraju sir's falcon... Bangaram sir's Black Peacock hits the ground. That's it! Make it drink some water, fast. I understand your pain... If you can save my name by winning this match... I'll leave four hens into your basket tonight. Please! Bangaram will never break his word about things like these. Leave it... This match is ours. Hit it. That's it... -Come on. -That's it. Superb! That's how you hit. Hit it! Superb! -It ran away! -It's running away. -Damn it! -That's how Bangaram wins! -Bloody cock! -Done and dusted! With one hit from Bangaram sir's Black Peacock... With it's mind blocked... Ammiraju sir's Falcon shifted into running race from a cockfight. Damn it! What's this Ammiraju sir? You win a match or lose a match. How can it run away? Cheap! My name got dragged through mud because of you, sir. You are right... Here. You changed your bet onto Bagaram's cock at the last minute. Nice move! Here... Check the count. Such a clever fellow. I have put the bet on our cock during the first three matches, sir. But I thought why lose money in the last round... Just act. Don't over act! Ok, sir. Nookaraju... If Bangaram is ten minutes late for the match... It means he might be in a dilemma of what scent to use... Or his cock might be having a date with a beautiful hen. With Bangaram in this village and his Black Peacock in the ring... It's impossible for someone else to win. How dare he swirl his mustache right in front of you! Even shrimp can swirl its mustache. I just let him go as he's just a teenager. But he's trying to act smart. For us to win, his cock shouldn't be in the ring... And he shouldn't be in this village. -Right? -Yes, sir. -Right? -Yes, sir. Everything is gone, President sir. My entire life is gone! What's all this? I told you not to get attracted to people earning on fish business. You turned your perfect paddy field into a pond. Now when you failed, you only remembered the loans and interests... But not your wife and your children, right? Did you even think of what will happen to them? Lucky he saw you on time. Or else, what would have happened? What else? He would have floated on the pond, just like his shrimp. How can it be possible that everyone earn profits in this business! Also, what you need to run a pond is not just water and shrimp. Where is it born? How will it grow? What will it eat? Where will it sleep? What is its length. How much does it weigh? And how much loss we will have to face if it dies? You should be an expert in all this. Or else, an entire generation should have lived on this business like us. I asked him to sell me his 5 acres, as it's located right in between my 50 acres. Did he listen to me? No. And see where he is now. Ok... Whatever happened has happened. I'll pay you the loss. Come sign the land papers. It's ok, Bangaram. A farmer's sweat drop feed few mouths... And his tear drop fill some pockets. If he sells his land just because he's in losses today... He won't be having even a piece of land to stand on. God, you are right, sir. But of course, everyone comes to help with words. But right now, he can use the money over mere words. Hey, watch your words before you talk to elders. God! What did I even say? Why are you getting so angry? When tomorrow comes, only that sun will be present to witness his poverty. Bye, sir. Uncle asked me to hand you this money. Please keep it. I can't take it, sir. If I would have listened to him that day, I wouldn't have been here today. We don't say that we belong to the same village just for namesake. We are here to help each other in difficult times. It's ok. Keep it. Stand at ease. Attention. Stand at ease. Attention. -Tell me, Bangaram. -We are getting late for the match! Hey, my niece won first prize in cockfight... Damn! First prize in running race. President has to come, hoist the flag, distribute the prizes... It seems like it will get late here. -You talk. -It's ok. Overacting all the time! Don't be shocked. We have to earn our own freedom. You distribute the chocolates, I'll hoist the flag. Let's go. [kids singing 'Maa Telugu talliki' by Sankarambadi Sundaraachari] Hey, what are you doing? Kids are getting tired from all the standing. If we hoist the flag, kids will eat the chocolates and will go play. Elders will have the mixture and go to work. -It's just a small pull. -Hey... To hoist a flag you have to have some knowledge about it. And you have to have some value in the society. Do you think of August 15th as two chocolates and a holiday! Of course, I know about it, master. A festival come every month. People get a holiday that day. And this comes in August. Also, who's as eligible as me in our village? You don't understand all that. Move aside! Namasthe! -Namasthe, sir. Come, son. -Namasthe! Aravindh, you too please come. -Namasthe, sir. -Namasthe! Please sit, sir. Please! Hey, spending ancestral money doesn't make you eligible. Only this country's President can hoist our flag over the Red Fort. And only the President to this village can hoist this flag. Sir, please hoist the flag. Aravindh, you too. Please come, sir. Hoist the flag. -I'll take leave. -Please! It's ok, you take care of things here. Ok. Bye, sir. -Bye. -Students... disperse. Kids, move in a line. Where are we? Aah! You don't have that in you. But some kites on the way and hoist them into the air. Get lost! Don't push each other. See, master... If a man with power is only consider great enough to hoist the flag... Next year... By this same date... I'll hoist a flag right here. Not as Bangaram. But as President Bangaram. Send in the nomination! No one saw it, right! This is Bangaram's first salute to all the Yandagandi people. To fill your dull lives with hope and joy... To make it rain in the hearts that went dry... Life is not about just earning... He'll make you understand that it's about enjoying too. Our Bangaram gives us all these promises as our next President. Anu... Get up, we are home. Sir, that brat Bangaram... How dare he run for president against you? You have to do something about it. What's wrong in it? Let him run. Hey... What's with this surprise visit? -Not even a phone call! -Couldn't manage, dad. It's ok. Welcome... -Lakshmi! -Sir... Take her in... Please go. -Aravindh... -Uncle? What are you staring at? Come here. Go get water bottles from Krishna's shop. -Ok. -No no no... -Call him and ask him to bring. -Ok. -You go get some fresh coconuts. -Ok. Go... Come... -Sit. -Doing good? I'm good, uncle. It's been so long, right? Will you stay for a while? A while? He'll go after the carnival. Right? No. I'm here to stay. -Namasthe, sir. -Namasthe. -Dad, I want to go to America. -Hey, careful! You are saying... I'm thinking of moving to America, dad. We never thought of it, right? What's there to think of, dad? Life will be great there. I'm planning to settle there after my studies. What? Haven't you slept yet? -What are you doing? -I came here suddenly, right? My boss is asking about my return. I said I won't. You said everything there is great, right? Are you in trouble? Do you need money or something? No! Nothing like that, dad. Everything is cool. She went missing for a day and the father inside me almost died. Only then I understood... How big a mistake I did staying away from you all these years. -Sorry! -It's ok, son. As she carries us for nine months, we will get to know a mother's value right away. But to realize how valuable a father is... You HAVE to be a father. Complete the work fast and go to bed. Hey, don't push each other. Calm down! Hey, they are still minors. Not majors. As if I have no idea about that! Once kids used to listen to their parents. Now parents are listening to their kids. Hey... I don't care if you stop eating food... Or cry out loud that you don't want to go to school. Tell your parents... I want all your parents' votes in wholesale. -Go it? -[all]: Yes, we did! They are not minors. They are majors! -Our symbol is... -[all]: Rooster. -Our symbol is... -[all]: Rooster. Leave now... -Hi, dude. -Hi. -How are you? -I'm good. -How are you? -Of course, superb! You didn't even tell us before going to America, getting married and got settled. I can't even stay out of our village just for one day. How can you guys go to another country and stay there for years! Going on trips to other countries should only be to earn and come back. You shouldn't forget your own village. You haven't changed at all. You are just the same. Forget me changing... Once I'm President, our entire village will change. Sending petitions to government for streets lights and roads... Waiting for them to get approved for years... No way! I'm the one who applies and I'm the one who approves. Forget about district and state levels... I'll make our village iconic on Delhi level. I forgot to ask... Are you here to help your father win the elections? Nothing like that. Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday. You have to come. Ok, I'll leave. Have to invite others too. Come on, you can invite them later. Sit down. You are here after so many years. Let's have a drink. All foreign brands available. It's ok. I'm here anyway, right? Some other time. Ok, as you wish. -Bye, dude. -Bye. Click a photo. -All the best, dear. -Say 'Thanks'. Happy birthday. I'm really happy to see you like this. Everything will be great from now on. Damn it! The entire pension batch is here. We should have burnt them in the last Bhogi (festival of burning old things). -Let's burn them after they vote for us. -Ok, let's go. Seems like you are burning up. Have it. You'll cool down. Thank you. Have it. -Thanks! -Thanks! The food is about to be over. Go eat. Look at them drink in leisure. Move! Enough with your stares. Move it! Ok? Happy? -Who invited him? -The same guy who invited you. What's with the late, Bangaram? Was busy with the campaingning... Is it? Ok ok. Please do eat. -Ok? -Ok. Sit... [chatter] Happy birthday, dear. Ammiraju sir, it's ok... Come on, give me your hand. Look at his build-up for just a ring made of 3 grams gold. Hey, come on. Click a picture. We gifted 3 grams of gold and he's here with just a doll worth 300 rupees. Come on. He is my friend Bangaram. -My wife Mounika. -Hello! I thought he's the slowest in our batch. I'm still single and he's celebrating his daughter's birthday. Dude! Rahul told me a lot about you. You are too fast it seems! Let's not talk about that now! Hey, Bangaram. -Do you need to do that now? -Hey, keep quiet. Bangaram's gift should be the biggest. Happy birthday. Hope this will teach us not to mess with him. Let's go, Ammiraju sir. It's high time... We have to give me a finishing touch! Dude, did you buy all the votes from that ward? All the votes are into our pocket, right? Don't miss even a single vote. Give them all that they ask for. Not even a single vote should go missing... Ok, bye! You... Give away whatever brand they ask for. We have to have all the votes. -Namasthe, Mr. President. -Namasthe! Why will we even look at that side with all this booze here? -My vote is for you, sir. -Same here, sir. -Hey... -Sir? -Give them a full bottle each. -Ok, sir. -Such a great man! -Yes. -Don't forget to vote for me. -[both]: Ok, sir. -Hey... -Sir? Hand out a Gold for this Bangaram (Gold). Here, sir. Bangaram sir... Here is the bill. -Such a huge bill for just three days! -That's the bill for just a day, sir. Is no one drinking water anymore? -Get lost... I'll pay later. -Ok, sir. -[everyone]: Namasthe, Bangaram sir. -Drink as much as you want. -Namasthe, Bangaram sir. -Don't forget to vote for the Rooster! Fix me a peg, dude. Rahul is the clever one among us all. Of course... It's not a small thing... Even if he came from America after so long... He invited everyone, without leaving out at least one family in the village. He even invited him... who never gets invited to anything! As he's as clever as you said, he invited me. Forget about him... Once I'm president, everyone invites me for everything! Birthday or a death day... Ribbon cutting or flag hoisting... I'll be the chief guest to every function. I bet 10k... Bangaram will never win as president. I bet 50k. He can't even win as a ward member. As if liquor and biryani will get him our votes! -Of course, we won't. -It's ok... His grandpa earned a lot of money, even without eating. At least let him payback to the village in this way. Let him pay back... Such a fool! Why will we leave the great man who helps in our difficult times... And vote for him! -[all]: No one will. -Let's drink. What's with him? Did he forget all that have happened last night! -Namasthe, future President! -Namasthe, sir. Tips for the festival... -Of course... -Sir! -How much do you need? -[both]: As you see fit, sir. -I'm your king. -Yes, sir. You are the people of my kingdom. -You should always be happy. -[both]: Sir! Have fun! Go. Let's go have fun. Damn them... Such two-faced! See how cunning they are. They take free stuff from us and praise the President. Don't feel bad. Next time, you are the president. Dude... No matter how much they cheat us... Mother Mavullamma will never cheat me. No one can stop me from being the president. If drunkards like them can think that sharp... I'm the one who gets them drunk... How sharp I i would be? Keep watching... The real festival will start now. Rahul, come on. Hey, Aravindh. Hey, what's happening? Who are they? Don't panic! Thieves attacked the kingdom... Now this king will go save the day. People will get connected to the sentiment... And this Bangaram will be the... President! No! Hey... You! God! You are my people... It's my duty to save you guys. -Sir! -I'm here for you, right? Be assured! You... Come on... Hey, you! What did I tell you and what are you doing? What did I tell you to do? Damn you! Hey, Aravindh! Aravindh! Rahul! Rahul, where are you? Hey... Where's Rahul? Let me go! Let me go! What's this? Have you gone mad? Leave me! What did I tell you and what the hell are you doing! I have explained to you our plan, right? Who the hell are you guys? Bangaram sir, no matter how much we drink, we are still scared! You please hire someone else... We are not coming. -Where are you going? Stay here! -Hey, you can't go. -Hey... -Can't you hear? -Let me go. -Can't you understand? Why don't he listen to us! What's with him? What happened? As your master, I would have slapped you long back. You didn't just kill him... You killed his trust in you. -Did the food taste good? -Yes, sir. Everything is good, sir... Except for one thing. How can you invite our opponent, sir? Too much! What's wrong in it? He's also one among us, right? He's my friend too. How can you be friends with someone who has no sense of good and bad? True... For someone to know that, he needs to have a family. But he has no one! We all try to correct our family members who does mistakes. But if the same thing happens in the village, we point at them. We never try to change them. Everyone is leaving the village in the name of jobs and businesses. But he stayed back. He loves this village. We have to change him. Not keep him at distance. Up to my knowledge, Bangaram is a headstrong fellow... But he's definitely not a bad guy. Such a great speech! Thank God, you didn't ask us to make him the president. What's wrong in it? Duty changes the one who even God can't change. Who knows? He might change too. Let's see. You always say that you want to enjoy everything, right? Now enjoy this guilt for your whole life. I don't know anything! I have nothing to do with this. Why are you even crying? For supporting you as a friend, you killed him in return. Say 'Yes', and I'll kill him right here right now. The moment he became the reason for a man's death... He died as a human that very moment. Let him go. That's how I got blamed for something I didn't do. I lost the only friend who believed in me. And I could never go back to my village. If they are not the ones you've hired, who are they? Why did they kill Rahul at all? As per your description, they are not there for robbery. They came with a strong plan to kill. To know more about people like them... Go meet Yadagiri in Hyderabad. Right... What tattoo did you say he had? Mom. It's Ghani who came. Look... You can't find him to just meet and talk. For Ghani to come out... He had to recieve some advance. And you need a person ready to die in his hands. I understood that I have to risk my life to get him out. That's why I ordered my own murder. This is just an advance... I thought Ghani would come for me... But Manikyam came. Only Ghani knew who paid for Rahul's death. And to get that out of him, I have to face him. Brother, he's the one who gave all the information about us. He made fools out of us, ordering his own murder. Ghani brother, please forgive me! I beg you! Please forgive me. Brother... Brother, please let me go! Where's Raju? His phone is switched off. Where is he? To stay away from us, he shifted to temple duty. Lord Vishnu and Mother Lakshmi woke up with a jolt... And they saw the Great Sage Brugu visit them. They both bowed for him in welcome. And then Mother Lakshmi... As he kicked him on Lord Srihari's chest, which is her home. She got insulted and started leaving for the Earth... Mother Srimaha Lakshmi got mad at Lord Srimaha Vishnu... But she finally came down to Earth in search of him... And ended up in Tirumala. And that's how... What, Raju sir? You are done with telling stories... And now you're listening to them, is it? Seems like you are getting free holy food on time! Nothing like that, Shruthi ma'am... You were close to me when I don't know who you are. And you are moving away when I did. What does that mean? I mean... I don't want to give you any of my problems. What problem? I liked you without even realizing it... But I know what I deserve and what I don't. Before I forget that... You made me realize it. Girls do have a lot of expectations. Once a man enters our lives, they all get expired. If he's fair, or dark... Thin or chubby... We don't care about all that! We'll think that he's our entire life. -Listen to me once... -Raju sir... Stop your security expressions and bring out the original. What happened? I'm on duty, right? Your duty got changed, Raju sir! I have always killed someone else's enemies until today... But I never had one. I might still let my enemy go... But once I get paid... I'll hunt until I get my kill. You did a huge mistake, ordering your own murder. Hey, catch him. Hey, stop! Catch him! Tell me... why did you kill Rahul? Who ordered his murder? You... Tell me... why did you kill Rahul? Who ordered his murder? Speak out! Who ordered his murder? This is not good. Not good at all, Ammiraju sir! He taught kids until yesterday... And now he'll settle our problems from tomorrow. How can they elect a retired old man unanimously with you still here? Too bad! Tell me this, Ammiraju sir... Don't you have enough properties? Or don't you have your people who will vote for you? Once his son said that Bangaram will be the president. Now he says that this master is the president. What are we in between? Fools? Not everything we think will happen. There is one more day to go, right? Even kingdoms fell in one day. He's just a president... And his position is nothing! It's time... Shall we start? Two minutes, sir. Murthy sir will be here. There he is. -Namasthe! -Namasthe... You did a good thing, Murthy sir. You made everyone accept the proposal with just one word - unanimous. He's a good man with enough knowledge. Who says 'No'? -Aravindh, careful! -Uncle! Careful! It's not me who you have to kill! It's him... What's all this, Ammiraju? He'll tell you. What did you say? We have to kill him, but not you! Did you hear what he said, President sir? Why is Ammiraju there in Ghani's place? Why did they hit me instead? Is this what you are wondering about? This time the plane is not yours. It's Bangaram's. Tell me... Why did you kill Rahul? I thought one murder will change my fate. This time I'll surprise you with the payment... Not even one of them should live. Why should I believe you? I'm not here to make you believe. I came believing in you. I need your help. This Ammiraju is always your enemy who wants to win over you. But he's never your friend who will help you. If my victory made you my enemy... I don't want that victory in the first place. And if my defeat makes you my friend. I'll lose all my life! I need your help. Like your son once said, Bangaram is a head-strong fellow. But not a bad guy. I thought my brother's son shouldn't be an orphan. And I took better care of you than my son. Even I loved you more than a dad. Uncle, Reddy sir sent money. You take care of all that from here on. He loves him as a father and also keeps up his respect. He should be the next president. I thought the property, your chair, and your respect will be mine after you. He'll leave after the carnival, right? No, I'm here to stay. He came back and shattered all my dreams. Making him a good man, he thought of taking away my chair too. Bangaram is a head-strong fellow. Not a bad guy. One gets the properties, and the other gets the chair. What will I i get? That's why I killed him using his plan and made him leave the village. But you still didn't change. The same old good heart. Is the chair a family heirloom? There's no need for it to go from me to my son and so on... This time... Let master, who knows everything about the village, be the president. You kept me aside... And you wanted to make someone else the president, right? That's why I planned to kill you this time. Never show your face to me in this life again. Get lost! Sorry, Bangaram. I made you suffer for what you didn't do. -Forgive me. -Sir... Please don't say that. I was supposed to grow up an orphan... But I had a great childhood. I thought that it's because of my grandpa's money. But I got it only after I left the village... It's because of this village and it's love that I grew up happy. On his deathbed, my grandpa asked me to enjoy everything... I thought eating until full... Having a great sleep... And living on my terms is what he meant! But, the relations that are around us. Friendship! And gathering memories for life... I failed to understand that that's what he meant. Also, to enjoy life we don't need money... We need friends. I understood that we can't buy them with money. -Please forgive me. -Hey, don't! You can act... Not overact! I have so much to do with you... Come on! Come! Haven't you had a bath? This smell won't go away with just a spray of scent. I was happy to be a security guard in Hyderabad. You brought me here with a promise of a much better life. But now I'm living in hell, feeding these fish and shrimp every day! She says that I ate the missing shrimp babies the other day. Rather than taking care of shrimp babies here... It's better to take care of kids in an orphanage. -I'm leaving! Bye... -Hey, stop! -I'm here for you, right? -That's what ruined my life... Wait... I'll end this today! -Let me talk to her. Come on. -Yeah. She thinks I'm her servant. What's this? With 1 lakh shrimp babies per acre... It has to be 100 tonnes on a count of 50. As per today's rate, let's say 3 lakh rupees per tonne. The total adds up to 3 crores. But why did the total has 2k less in it? Do you know how valuable 2k is? Who else will know the value of 2k better than you? Shut up! What are you doing here without going to the pond? That's... I won't keep quiet if the count reduces this time. We HAVE to get the count we aimed for! Understood? -Move now! -Ok, sister. -Let's go. -Yeah. Sit. I just understood something... No matter how strong the king is... -It's the queen that actually rules. -You're still here! Yeah, we are leaving... -She might hit us! -Enjoy the married life! THE END
