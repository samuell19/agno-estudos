"He could not find one good man on earth..." "They had all corrupted their paths, and destruction rained down on the cities." Enjoy the show but mind your own fucking business, okay? Here, have your keys back. Nice parking! A couple of scratches, but with all those molotovs. I'll call the police! You sons of... Quiet, grandad, you participated in the revolution, you deserve a medal. Here it is! - You'll pay for that! - That's enough, buddy. And look, this doesn't fish, it shits! It shits big balls! - A donation for the revolution. - Leave us alone! Very generous! The people thank you. He did a good deed, you shouldn't upset him! Leave us alone. Go away. Go! What have we got here? You look like Brigitte Bardot. Anyone ever told you that? - A small loan. - Thieves! If you ever feel like singing, because you're a rat! Come on, move it. Forget about those bums. Thieves! 'Dirty World' Fuck you! Tripping without me? - We left you some. - How did it go with the old man? That fucking pervert's always horny! One of these days he'll be home alone and he'll take me there. - Happy? - At last! - Like a contract, orders executed. - Whose orders? - Who cares? - I'd like to know. The trick's enough for me. He's loaded, between films and politics he's made a ton of cash. About those photos. Everything's okay. - It's all for the country! - My compliments, Senator Aledericci. - No half measures! - That's how we must intervene! The party needs honest people! But if one of your own turns out bad, you look the other way. May I ask a question? Can a woman be half pregnant? No, you have to be one hundred percent honest. And if I find just one case of corruption in our party... I'll turn them in, regardless. - This campaign will serve you well. - I believe so. Gentlemen, an applause! Look who's here, my son the revolutionary! Decided to start following the rules? Who knows? If you can clean this place up! Dad, I'm in trouble. I need some cash. Well that's nothing new. What is it? Another ticket? Or do you want to finance some other revolution? What revolution? You know I don't think like you. Right, I had noticed. Listen, Massimo. I have an important meeting at the house tonight. I have to disappear, I get it. Yes, head over to the Rocca Fiorita courthouse with our friendly advisor. I'll see you later. - You must get that dossier. - Okay. - Well, are we going to the courthouse? - Let's go! It will all go smoothly. The son's away and the nanny has a day off. The information comes from a reliable source. Here he is, the big man has arrived. I see you've been waiting for me in good company. - Manuela, it's been a while. - Yes, he's Rene, do you like him? I told you about him. He knows lots of games. They'd like to join in, if you don't mind? Why not? Manuela might make a pleasant diversion. A photo, Senator, for the press! - Buddy, photograph my chest! - Get in the car, don't be an idiot! He took my photo, he's going to publish it! - I haven't seen you around, how come? - Because. And Nadia, has your great romance finished? I still remember the premiere of Massimo's film. That film really was terrible. - I had a small part in it. - And you were good. Massimo talked a lot about you, even before he started working on the film. Anyone could see he was crazy about you. Really? Then, when he saw you dancing with Nadia. You were flirting openly. God, he was angry! But I don't get it, Nadia, why did you do it? - We all have our weaknesses. - Well he didn't take it well. - And I don't think he's over it. - The crush or the rage? Women can be so cruel! - We've arrived, this is my house. - It's falling apart! The outside walls, but check out the paintings inside. The opposite of men, they try to look good on the outside... 'Homosex cocktail' Careful, it's an aphrodisiac! - We can trust each other, right? - Massimo doesn't know anything. A joint isn't going to be enough. I'm not lifting my dick if I can't shoot up. There's a syringe as well but you'll have to earn it. This dossier is hot! It's exactly what the Senator was looking for. Over a million has gone missing. Contracts. Building lots. My father had guessed as much. Dad, we've got the proof, he's trapped. Listen to this, two million lira allocated by the government... after the floods in 72' but the locals only saw 400,000! Not bad! The rest are silent, another smart move by the Party Secretary. - You can incriminate him. - You're such an idiot! Don't talk on the phone. If it's tapped, our work is pointless. And don't say anything in front of that counsillor, he's an idiot. Take the dossier and leave. Have you got that? But he's one of us! He can't wait to see Merelli on his knees. Don't trust him, he works for whoever pays him. I've done a good job, just bear that in mind when you become party secretary. Forget about politics. Stick to films, you'll be a director one day.. But even then you'll always be a nobody. - Is the Senator satisfied? - Yes, of course, and he thanks you. - You're a smart man. - Just doing my job. He told me to give you this little gift. Some discretion. Thank you. Please, this way. - Well, goodbye again. - Thank you, thank you very much. - Be seeing you. - Goodbye. - Let's bring her as well. - Later. You like beautiful things as well, don't you? The shapely splendour, the proportions, the balance of its parts. Look, they're over 600 years old. These ceilings ooze a sensual beauty. I couldn't live without them. Their beauty defies all conventions. Questioning morality. The fear of pleasure. What nature offers us is beautiful because we can enjoy it. We are composed of the elements that make up our dreams. Try to understand. I know it's hard for you but make an effort. The elements that make up our dreams! The elements that make up our dreams, my little Ascanio. And our brief existence, because life is always far too brief. Our brief life, I was saying, is all locked up in a dream. And then he kills him, if I remember correctly, my dear Ascanio. Take the sheet. Applause! 'Tempest' Act 4 Which is also the inscription in the cemetery for Hollywood's divas... where I enjoyed a memorable success. I'd like to show you a very precious item. This cadeux belonged to Francesca Bertini, the diva of my dreams! But no more games. So that diva gave you this jar? You're tickling me! Listen, Caligula, that's enough, hand over the cash! - I haven't got anything! - Let me jog your memory. Be reasonable, I don't keep anything here. Bastard! I don't have it, believe me! Help! You'll kill me! - That's enough, let him go! - Old pervert! Faggot! Are you crazy? - Why did you kill him? - He was a pervert! We weren't meant to kill him! Just look for the money! The safe! You lost, Senator. - Did you hear that? - Fuck! Our clothes! Hurry up. The camera. Who are they? Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Come on, what the fuck are you waiting for? Dad! God! Damn them! Who are you? Manuela! I can't live without you, don't you get it? It's over, deal with it. And don't judge me! What do you know about my aspirations? You're spineless! Living in daddy's shadow! I want to be independent and rich! Whatever it takes! It's all wrong, what you're doing is dangerous! If I get burnt, amen! At least I'm having fun! But this isn't a game, you're risking your life! I don't give a fuck about life! I sell guns to whoever pays best. Anyway, they're all the same! The easy life isn't enough for you. The parties, the debts I end up paying! - Please, dad! - Now you're all protesters and anarchists! - Stop it! - Stop it? I pulled you out of jail to protect my reputation. But if it happens again I'll leave you there to rot! And I won't say a word. It might do you some good. We all get what we deserve! You got that? - Well? - Nadia, it's Massimo. Surprised? Something's happened... that could turn my life upside down. Such as? What do you mean? They've killed dad! Slaughtered, like a dog! And Manuela's involved. She's wounded, it might be serious. Say something? - Christ, she's your lover isn't she? - It's over, a long time ago. - Leave me out of it. - You should be here. - I'm on duty. - I don't care, hurry up! I'll be there as soon as I can. - Who is it? - It's me. About the photos... Something's come up. - Deal with it. - Okay. We all get what we deserve! I had no idea it was her. Will she make it? I can feel the bullet, it isn't too deep. Who'd have thought she'd come back here to kill the old man. You can't trust a whore. She gave me her love, exciting, passionate! Like a marvelous summer! And then she ran to you, into your arms. She was your lover, but which one of us was she lying to? I can't figure out what Manuela and her friends were looking for. - You think they were looking for money? - Yes, perhaps. - That's what I think - Junkies always need money. Or something to blackmail him? Pass me the drip. The drip, did you hear me? What a mess. Don't you think you should call the police? Don't worry, I won't report it. Happy? If you report it you'd be dragging his honourable name through the mud. The champion of honesty, he wanted to shame the head of the party. Yes, he was a hypocrite, but a scandal would bring all of us into it. All of us? You mean Manuela, she'd be incriminated. And you don't care? You're still in love with her, aren't you? - What do you see in her? - She fooled you as well. There's something else... There's something else. Dad had a life insurance policy. 600,000 But there's a clause. He has to die of natural causes. You're not thinking of covering up a murder? You're a doctor, you could say he died of a heart attack. - You think it's easy? - It would be in everyone's interests. And we'll split the insurance money. Okay, I'll do it. I brought something that might be useful. Cosmetics? For a dead guy? It's a wax they use in the morgue. To patch up accident victims for their families. - It's like make-up. - Actors are used to make-up. You should stay for a few days. Your room's how you left it. Okay. I was thinking about the other two, who were with Manuela... Let's not fool ourselves into thinking they've disappeared. Don't worry, Manuela will have to help us when she recovers. I'm feeling dizzy. I feel like I'm blundering in the dark. I realise I'm all alone. I always wanted to be independent. In charge. But not like this... With my father's blood on my hands. At last! Well? - They killed him. - Christ! We need to cover it up. - Tell them something else. - What shall I do? Think of something. I'll say he died of a heart attack on his death certificate. - It has to be convincing! - We have no choice. Then try it. Teresina. Nadia! - You're back. - Yes, I'll be staying for a few days. I'm glad. Listen, I have some terrible news. You're not going to like it. - Yes? - The Senator is dead. A heart attack? He was never ill. I suffer from heart problems, I could die any time. But him? It's impossible! He was such a good man. - Do you remember her? It's Manuela. - My god, what happened? She's injured. Why is she here? An accident, they were playing target practice, Massimo fired a round... and injured her. It's all happening now. They're playing with guns, the Senator has a heart attack... Teresina, you're talking a lot of nonsense. Get back to work. - I was speaking for you. - Leave. - Who's that guy with the shades? - Calandra, from the insurance company. Merelli's arrived. Go over to him. Go! No one will bother him now. They organised this farce for that dumb faggot. My condolences, it's a tragic loss. He was a great man. Loved by everyone in the party. We're really going to miss him. I know he'd collected some sensitive information. Not that it worries me, far from it. But seeing as that inquiry isn't needed anymore. It would be better to archive it. I know you also worked on it and we'll come to an agreement. - Okay, I'll see you soon. - I'll be waiting. Who are they? Manuela's accomplices? They're already on to us. Damn them! So they didn't turn her in. They're treating her like an angel. Leave it, not now. - What do you want? - We want to visit the patient. - It's an act of charity. - It's our duty. Come back, when she's better. Tomorrow? Okay, tomorrow. Why did you open the door? What are you playing at? Playing at? I was with you. And she was already in the room when I heard her. Anyway, what harm has she done? What's there to hide? Out. - Giulio, hurry up! - Yes, I heard, I'm coming. Load up an infra-red roll. Sodom and Gomorrah. Civilization, refinement, but above all a symbol... of the worst kind of degenerates. They had all the vices. Theft, murder, hate and fury, just like today. And they unleashed the wrath of God. Abraham attempted to mediate, pleading for clemency, saying... Lord, you're right, you want to punish these bad people... but you can't destroy the good ones as well. The village may well be a cesspit of abomination and sin... but if I were to find fifty good men, will you spare us? God accepted and waited. A few days later the patriarch kneeled before God again... and he said, Lord, if I were to find forty five good men... will you spare us your wrath? God accepted again. But Abraham returned to the temple more nervous than before, and pleaded. Father, if I were to find just twenty good men..." If I found just ten, will you spare us? The Lord gave the man yet another chance... but he couldn't even find one good man... and destruction rained down on the village. The editor of The New Express. Yes? No, I don't have anything ready on the Senator. Sherlock Holmes, something smells rotten, get ready for a fiery funeral! - Hurry up with the announcement. - Yes, look. I wouldn't go around provoking certain political groups. - He's dead, let him rest in peace. - No, first his moral crusade... then he picks up two guys and his son's girlfriend. That's quite a bundle! - He went out in style! - Then the whore turns up at the funeral. Along with those two little angels. They're keeping vigil over the corpse. It isn't wise to swim upstream. We'll get caught in their nets! Not scared, are you? This scoop will set me up for life! We'll publish the article and it's going to cause a stir, but don't disappear. I thought you fought for truth and justice. 600,000 isn't a small amount. As an insurance company we must proceed carefully. Give us time to verify all the details. But everything's in order according to the contract. The premium was paid, he died of natural causes. I don't understand. - Neither do I. - Pardon? I don't understand why you're in such a hurry. As though there's something embarrassing about it. Speak up! What are you getting at? Nothing specific. A theory. Just a theory. Another week and it will all be resolved, you'll see. I'm counting on it. I'll see you soon. My condolences. Manuela! The inheritance will arrive just in time for Massimo. I lived in this house for ten years... but I never knew Massimo was in so much trouble. Because he's a subversive? For political reasons? No, his gambling debts with all the local gambling dens. He's being blackmailed by a loan-shark who keeps threatening to report him. Aren't you going to ask me who was on the phone? It was Rene. The Senator looks funny naked, a fascinating sequence, he says... but he doesn't know what to do with the photos, he wants money. It's old news, the photos are worthless, you killed him, amen. I had no idea it was going to end like that. A drug induced panic, I told you, it was a violent sex act. - Get rid of them. - They won't let me go so easily. You have to leave them. It's for the best, I'll take care of you, trust me. Yes? Look at this! 'The 1972 Floods' What is it? Nothing, papers, statistics, junk! An inquiry into the party secretary. Hot stuff. If some of these indiscretions got out... Senator Merelli would be walking on hot coals. You think? What can I say? He was healthy. I wasn't expecting a heart attack. A somewhat strange heart attack. - I'd like to know as well. - We saw that injured woman. She didn't hurt herself cutting her nails, what's that about? - Teresina, come here! - I must be going. What is it? A state secret? Why is he snooping around? He's a journalist. He's writing about the Senator. And you gave him something interesting to write about. I told him I didn't know anything. Serve the tea. Am I interrupting? No, wait. They're my friends. Long time no see. You're doing okay for yourself. Cowards. I wasn't expecting it... The first sound of gun fire and you ran away! What the fuck could we do? Our lives were on the line. You tossed me away like an old shoe, and now you turn up in this. Who have you ripped off? Tell us about you. Where did he get you? Listen, what's this story about a heart attack? Well, a gay scandal wouldn't go down too well. - Where's the money? - Leave it to me. Don't bother me again. I'll come to you. Listen, we need some powder. We're dry and we're desperate. We have visitors. - It's the little orphan. - The capitalist master. - The pervert's son. - Cut it out! Some discretion. He's still in mourning. Look at him move! Greetings, lord of the manor. What do they want? - Tell him. - Massimo... This is Rene and Lello, your father knew them. Are you queer as well? - What do you want? - Can't you guess? Don't strain yourself. If you don't know. He was your father's boyfriend, and he killed him. Son of a bitch! It's funny you haven't told the police about us. Do you like hard photos? We developed them with our own hands. And these are the softer ones! - How much? - That's up to you. We'll see if it's worth it. If not, well it won't be hard to sell them to someone else. It's a friendly proposal. - It's blackmail. - Really? Listen... When? Tomorrow morning. Manuela knows where to find us. And bring some gear, we'll celebrate little ducky's death. Do you want to get down with me as well, little orphan? See you around! I'll serve the tea! Criminal scum! Who do they think they are? I'll crush them! I'm going to prepare a little surprise for them. What the hell! Who's he? - What the hell are you doing? - I'm a photo reporter. I guessed that. Apologies for the intrusion. Giuliano Ray. Give me the film! - Got it! - Give back my camera! Forget it! Who sent you, spy? Talk, or I'll drown you! You'll feel this! Stop! Damn you! Stop! You wanted to kill him for a roll of film, you're crazy! Some of the cables must be loose. I'll have to get it repaired. Yes, I'll take care of it. They're all over us like vultures. You don't give fuck about me! But I swear if I go down you're coming with me! You know why I didn't turn you in? Why I didn't go to the police? Have you figured it out? Nadia told me it was because of the insurance. She told you about the insurance. How considerate. No, you've been misinformed. There's another reason. Remember our game? When you asked me to prove my love to you? Now you have it. That's enough! Sit down. We can always get those two lunatics arrested. Those fucks! We'll send them both to jail. That sounds like a solution. I'll take care of it. You'll give them the drugs and cash they asked for. They'll be so satisfied. Just one call. Let me have a word with Merelli. We'll get rid of them. Count on it! Senator, sorry to trouble you. This is Albericci. I found your number in dad's diary and I need a favour. I'm glad you called, we share some common interests. I know, in fact I wanted to tell you that I'll be coming to see you. - When? - Tomorrow, I'll bring that famous dossier. - I'll be waiting, I'm sure I can help. - I'm counting on it, tomorrow afternoon. I was saying, it's a little job for the drug squad. They're two thugs, I'll give you the details later, okay? Okay, I'll be waiting. Damn it! Where is that bitch? Bitch! Well? Did you get it? Looks like I've arrived just in time. First I want the negatives. - And the cash? - It's real. In the bag. - Hand over the cash. - Sure thing. - Will you be back? - Who knows? Bye, assholes! Are we disturbing you? Who are you? What do you want? Can't you tell? We're your guardian angels. Aren't you clever. Getting ready for a trip? Who? Us? No! Well it looks like you are. We'll sort you out! You like the hard stuff? Try this! You know you almost hurt me. Eat it! Eat the drugs you've thrown up! Eat it! - Stop him! - With pleasure! Still feeling rowdy? Look! Quite an arsenal. They're in with the big guys but they need a break. Documents, reports, conferences... Nothing's missing. Sales contracts and payments to the commission. Statistics. But I still can't find that famous dossier of ours. An unforgivable oversight. Please leave us alone. - You'd better come clean with me. - Yes? I know the temptation to exploit certain information can be seducing. We're talking about millions stolen from the state. Yes, I think a lot of people would be very interested. I shouldn't even have to ask for that dossier. But I might have some photocopies sitting in a lawyer's office. You're chancing it, but you'll never win. - How much? - I have a problem. That lawyer, Calandra, from the insurance company, isn't he one of yours? He's making it very hard for me to cash in my father's policy. Can you persuade him? Yes... The policy. 600,000 Calandra says there are complications. - Minor quibbles, he's nit-picking. - Nit-picking, you say? I'd be very grateful if... Yes, I believe I can persuade Calandra to overlook certain details. The Mafia commands, the soldiers respond. I want that dossier today. How about when the insurers pay up? Okay. - Go ahead, you play detective. - They'll have to exhume the body. You won't believe the scandal these documents will cause. You've done a good job. Those two junkies were picked up by the drug squad. They're politically motivated but it's all hot air. Where does Andrei the loan shark fit in? Massimo Alberrici, when he died, his father had sold some jewellery in a hurry... Then he ran to the boss and paid off an old gambling debt. - Look at that, a gambler as well. - Thanks. Leave it with me and I'll publish it at the opportune moment. - The opportune moment? - I don't want to upset any politicians. - Let's be careful. - What do you mean? - I'll want the negatives, of course. - Are you crazy? The order is to cover it up, sweep it under the rug. An order? Whose? A friend of the Senators', some big shot. Cowards! You haven't heard the last of this! Who are you calling? Be careful! It's about saving our prestige, for the country, for the party. How much did they pay you? The first rule of politics is silence. Official hipocracy. The public can't know everything, they're left in the dark. They say it's for the greater good. Who gave the order? Who's behind it? You'll still be paid for your work. You've turned me into a drug dealer. I need to get high. You'll feel better straight away. It's a sweet thrill. Try it as well. Have an experience. Making love feels so different. - Isn't that what you want from me? - You know I do. Bitches! Damned whores! You left her! It was over between you! Lying bitch! Whores! Good work, Teresina! We forgot you knew all the old man's secrets. What do you want from me? What a great idea! Steal this little gold mine and split! All these years I've dedicated to your father, I thought I had the right. I raised you. I could have turned you in. I knew it was you who killed the Senator. I could have sent you to prison and kept all the money. It doesn't matter. Keep it, just let me go. Where? What are you doing? No, put that drill down! - Stop her! - What are you doing? - Are you crazy? - Please make her stop! Stop her! What are you going to do? It's stupid to take risks and you're dangerous! You talk too much! The autopsy will show it was just a heart attack, genius! - My compliments. - Animal! Do you realise what you're saying? She was like a mother to us and that's all you can say? Shut up, hipocrite. How can you preach morals? My father's also dead and it was you who sent those two little angels. I figured it out, you know. Even if I don't know why you did it? We'll split everything. Including the insurance money. - Disappointed, lawyer? - The autospy confirmed the heart attack. So the doctor doesn't simply photocopy her death certificates. It was a joke, I do apologise. Two heart attacks, one after the other, seemed too much. Have you thought of anything else to stall the insurance company? The world government is in the hands of the politicians, they decide. But they're too high up to understand them, what can I do? Obey, state reasons. But you're not convinced. Take it. - What is it? - The receipt, 600,000 in your account. Finally! No one's going to suffer for it. You take it from one place and pass it to another, it's like a roundabout. My compliments and condolences. 600,000! Who's there? Good evening. I'm Senator Merelli's secretary, do you remember me? Yes, I saw you in his office. These gentlemen are with me. - I'd like you to return the dossier. - Yes, of course. I'll show you the way. Please, come in. Have a seat. This won't take long. - They broke the lock. - You mean it's been stolen? It's strange. I don't get it. I'll go and see if someone's moved it. I'll find out and I'll be right back. There was a file in the library. A dossier on Merelli, have you taken it? - I don't know anything about it. - It's disappeared, I'm in a real mess. Have you found it? There were so many people here for the funeral... - Perhaps... - Then it's been stolen! No, what are you talking about? I'll find it, it's got to be here. I'll call the Senator. Give me a few days and I'll find it. Calm down! - A deal is a deal, calling him won't help. - But I want to explain, it isn't my fault. I assure you it was here. The dossier! We've got to stop them! Leave him alone! Stop! - Upset? - Aren't you? That dossier is too important, I can control all of them! - It's worth more than him. - But they're killing him! What are you doing? Stop! Here's your dossier. We can go. So you took it. We happened to notice it. Sons of bitches! I'll get them, now I have one more reason to make a film now. They won't ignore me anymore. Because I'll tell them a story that's scary and real, that will hit them! - What story? - Our story! - You'll make a film about it? - Can you think of anything more cruel? What we've actually done! The drill, the heart attacks... The old man dying in an orgy, the criminals! You might be on to something! It could work, but it's dangerous. And Merelli will get what he deserves. I'll shame him in public, mercilessly! I'll reveal the deceptions in the dossier... The bids, the lynching, the corruption, all of it. If you tell them how your father died it would cause a scandal. Different names, different locations, they'll never know. You're living on the razor's edge. You really are crazy! And I'll be a star! We'll be a famous couple. The director and his actress! - Don't let him drag you into it. - You'll be a star as well. - You'll have a marvelous role! - No, I'm not involved. - Keep me out of it. - You are involved. And you're going to tell us when your role in all of this started? Don't be a fool, you can't fight them, they're too powerful. I've had enough of your jealousy! I'll always be with you on the shoot, on our honeymoon... - And you leave me alone! - No, let her speak. It might be interesting. Go on, tell us. What are you up to? What do I know? I swear, I know as much as you do. I'm just scared. Forget about her. Let's start. Yes, you're right. First scene. - Is that you? - Yes, it's me, we're still in danger. You have to stop them, no matter what. Me? How can I? Kill them, and don't get emotional about it. So you've finally decided to show yourselves. You weren't expecting us, were you? She isn't exploding with joy because she wasn't expecting us. What do you want? Nobody wants a scandal. According to the press the old man left behind quite a tidy sum... - and we do like the good life. - Yes? Sure, in the interests of the family's good name. You've gone quiet. - Don't tell me you're not interested. - I don't care about family business. - I don't give a fuck! - Ladylike! You haven't forgotten about your friends now you've got your millions? - Okay, I'll think of something. - What do you suggest? Give me some time to think. Greetings, Cecil B. Demille. He's dressed up like a movie director. Handsome little orphan! - I heard everything. - A spy as well. - Tonight, at Ponte Romano. - Hold on... - I prefer the stone cave, like old times. - Okay. But no tricks or I'll be calling the cops this time. Bye, capitalist. - You don't trust me? - Where is he? This has nothing to do with him, it's between us. Lower the artillery. I brought your share, 50,000. Much obliged! But the game's over. Stay out of my way... because I won't be blackmailed again. Right, you don't need your old friends anymore. You're living the high life. 50,000! - Did you get the money? - Done. Help me. We're free! Everything's going great! those two assholes can't touch us now! Love life, Nadia! We're rich! We're free! Hello? Police? Can you hear me? Come to villa Albericci. Hurry! Murder! No, I'm not a police officer. I'm a journalist, I'm doing a report. Is it political? Yes! Albericci was a senator. Hello? You're here as well! How did you know... They already told you? I was trying to call the police... But I got cut off. Did you know the phone is tapped? But the Inspector will still come, isn't that right? My compliments, a fine set of infra-red photos. You'll be able to sell them to newspapers all around the world. - It would be a real scoop. - I hope so. I get it, you're the one who stopped my article being published. Is that right? The film. Hold on, that's too convenient. You can't bury this and let it rot in the archives. Those two guys mutilated at the cave, and now these two! It's been very hard to keep all this quiet... and you want to re-ignite a scandal that could involve all of us. I've been expecting you. Doctor! Come down. You could certify that they both died accidentally. Electrocuted in the swimming pool, it's the truth after all. What about the police? Forensics? The authorities know what they have to do for the greater good. You've got it all worked out. What can a fly do against the system? Maybe tomorrow they'll read about how it was crushed to death in an accident. What can a fly do? It can fly away. Why be a hero? You'll find another scoop quite easily with your resources, Mr. Ray. I suggest you try in Central Africa. An inquiry into the new democracies. Negroes freed from tryanny and oppression. I think I'll pass. A vacation in the countryside, very healthy. - The film! - In Central Africa. You'll find a ticket at the airport. You leave tomorrow. My regards and good luck. That seems like it went well. Thank you. Poor Nadia. Keep an eye on her. She's suffered a lot. And she knows too much... too much. "This is the dirty world we've built and suffer in every day, like monkeys." "Monkeys that don't speak, don't hear, don't see." "History has taught us..." "He couldn't find one good man on earth..." "They had all corrupted their paths, and destruction rained upon the cities."
