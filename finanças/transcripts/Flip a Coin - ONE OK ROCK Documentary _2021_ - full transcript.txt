We have to think of it as an unexpected challenge and just go for it. Yeah, it's not unique to our profession. It pertains to people all over the world. So we have to keep challenging this circumstance. That's all we can do. Well, on the other hand, I want things to return to the way they used to be. I make it sound like it's been ages. Well, I'm hoping to perform in front of a live audience like we used to someday. We have to get through this and that's why we need to do this now. This really is backbreaking work. Well, we had lost so much. Honestly, there's a deep sense of uncertainty. When I first heard about it, I thought, "We can't do it." I tested positive. Like my future was swept away. This was the first time we really didn't know what to do. There was so much we had to do. We'll do it again on the day of the concert. You want us to die, huh? Who are we performing for? It's super slippery! But that's precisely why we wanted a massive venue. There were some huge adjustments along the way. -It's crazy! -We'll give it our best. Maximum concentration. Delivering our music. We can't let our guard down, ever. Are we about to go live? Let me check the monitor one more time. It's only once and that's why it's meaningful. Whether we stop along the way, no matter what… This is what rock bands do. I have to do this. Thank you! Let's go, everyone! Three, two, one, jump! This was probably the first time in my life when I really didn't know what I could do. When we performed in Australia, I thought, "Oh, can we complete the tour?" As the coronavirus spread, I felt immense fear. It was as if everything I wanted to do was being robbed away. The state of emergency was declared in April. We couldn't even leave our house for days on end. I felt that I was suddenly shut out from the world. Like I was thrown in a room. At best, it was a rare experience and at worst, well, it was the worst. It was the start of a time like that. Let's start. Let's go! We were talking about if there's anything we can do. Taka was the first one to come up with the idea. There was nothing to do and I was bored. That's how it all started. I also wanted to make someone smile. Yeah, we wanted to create something fun. At first, we were going to film it by ourselves. Something like remote work, you know. We didn't talk about how the other band members were preparing for it. Whatever we filmed, we uploaded. THAT WAS THE BEST! EVERYONE WAS FREAKING HILARIOUS! THAT REALLY WAS THE BEST! IT GAVE ME THE ENERGY TO GO ON! But we were the ones who benefited the most from it. I really enjoyed making those videos. It's been a while since I last played bass. It was loads of fun! ONE OK ROCK GUITARIST TORU CONTRACTS THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS Toru called me out of nowhere one day. I couldn't pick it up. I thought, "Why would Toru call me?" I felt uneasy. I wanted to know if something had happened. I was tired from training all day. I went to sleep earlier than usual. Around midnight, I had a bad chill. I had a high fever around midnight that continued until the morning. That's why I went to the hospital. That's how it all started. I called Mr. Yamashita and told him I tested positive. Of course, I couldn't go out of my hospital room, not even one step. The nurse wore PPE. I couldn't see anything but her eyes. It gave me time to think about many things. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. I never want to end up there ever again. Have you ever held a livestream concert before? No, never. Generally, the audience is what makes our concert. By sharing the space together, we create a symbiotic relationship where we build the powerful moments of a concert. I couldn't imagine a concert without the audience. I thought it wasn't possible when I first heard about it. But I wanted to do a live performance. Frustration was building up and I had too much on my mind. Moreover, we were supposed to be touring. My ideas began to develop. I had more time to think. "I have to start here". That's how I felt. You filmed it? I want to watch it. I'll send it to you. Please. Can't wait to see it. Wait, hold on. What is this? What the heck? This is absurd. There's something I want you all to be aware of. Do you know about American football? Yes. I want to do something like their half-time show. I want to create a ONE OK ROCK experience in the 90 minutes we have. Yes. Since the stage is so big, I want to use every bit of it. We have the venue and we have lots of ways to stage it. I personally want to use it to its fullest. I was prepared to take on all the risks from the beginning. I wanted to put on more than just a concert. I wanted to create an experience beyond just that. I thought it's much better to have some tension to it. To me, that's what being a rock band is all about. That's why I wanted a powerful performance in a huge venue. No matter what happened at the end, I wanted to put all my chips in this idea. The audience can only join us through a screen. What will we look like through a screen at home? I wasn't sure how it would turn out. We needed to rehearse. Try different things as we rehearsed, at that. -akkin. -It's been a while. -This is crazy. -Look at you. -akkin. -It's okay, I can hug you. What? Do you remember this, akkin? Of course I do. -Oh, hello. -Hey, sorry. Long time no see. -It's been a long while. -Toru looks younger. -I got a haircut. -Oh, you did. Well, -it suits you. -Are you okay? -Is it for coming back from COVID? -I have a pulse. -I'm back for good. -We were in the studio. -Well… -The three of us. -I still feel fatigued. -We were discussing future plans -Are you back to yourself? -when he tested positive. I am. Don't worry. You look like you lost weight. -Well, yeah. -You haven't worked out. -I haven't worked out. -You lost some muscle here, Toru. It really feels like today is the official start. We had a long break after we finished the Australia tour in March. I need to get back into the concert mood again. Was that too short? -It sounded a bit strange. -Yeah, it did. -Just like that. -I forgot how this feels. It feels quite short based on the feel of the instruments. It felt like therapy. When I heard the sound through the amplifier, it all started to come back to me. We needed to get back into our groove. Here's the worst that can happen. Imagine we contracted COVID at the start of October. Oh, man. That would be the worst. -That's my worst fear. -Yeah. We don't know when we'll get infected, honestly. That's my concern. No matter how many precautions you take, you could still catch it. What should we do, Toru? I'm really worried about it. What if we get infected around October? All this will be for nothing. Right. That's my worst fear. I'm worried. Mori, I heard about you on the news. Where did you go? I went to Atami. Yugawara. Why didn't you use sunscreen? Well, it's been such a long time since I went outdoors. I haven't done anything like that for a while. I forgot about sunscreen. You're a few shades darker. It didn't even cross my mind. It surprised me. You were on the news. You got super dark. I'm not just tanned. It's more like a sore. It really hurts. I got burned. Well, then… shall we talk about the concert? Let's have akkin-san join us. -Sure. -Okay. Well, last time, we discussed the string ensemble. What do you think? Well, I have one thing to say. Since we decided to keep it simple, I was hoping to have a pianist or a violinist or something. Just one instrument like that. Depending on the song, of course. I was listening to "Change" and it gave me an idea. That song will sound impressive if it sounds grand, so I want to do something special for that number. Maybe we can have more musicians or something like that. I don't know. It might also be fun to have background dancers in costumes, something like that. I'd like to expand the scene to get the audience excited. I mean, why not? Have we decided anything for "Change" yet? What about the dancers? Or extending the interlude? Let's try "Change" once more. It's powerful to have many performers. Whether that suits ONE OK ROCK's style is a different problem. It's also about how we convince the audience of this expression as musicians. I think that's important too. Good evening! ONE OK ROCK! This day is finally here. How are you viewers doing? This is a special live event. Our anger, frustrations, happiness… It's time to break them all! Now, let's start ONE OK ROCK live online! Together now, everyone! Wow. Good morning. Ryusuke-san, good morning. He's known me since I was in fifth grade. This is Ryusuke-san. Great to meet you. -Has it been 20 years? -About that long. Ryusuke-san has styled my hair for over two decades now. This sure brings back memories. Your hair was so long back then. Oh, that looked good. Oh, I look crazy. I didn't know what look I was going for. I think I was lost during that time. -Amusing. -That's pretty amusing. I uploaded this when I got married. It doesn't look too bad. I'm surprised Michelle permitted you to wear your hair like that. Can't believe Michelle allowed it. At that salon, at the beautician's place, there was a little yard with a lawn. You danced on that lawn. I don't recall that at all. Not at all? Yeah, I first got interested in dancing in the last year of kindergarten. I visited the dance school my older sister attended. I went for a tryout and really enjoyed dancing. I got really into it. I joined a dance group in fourth or fifth grade. When I was in junior high, the agency suggested that since we got pretty far, we might as well move to Tokyo. That's how Toru and I ended up moving to Tokyo. We attended junior high in Tokyo as we continued to dance, but it didn't go well. That was the end of our dance career. Honestly, Toru became passionate about music during that time. He told me he bought an electric guitar. I had no understanding of music at that time. I didn't know what the instrument was called, and he told me it's an electric guitar. That's when he learned how fun a band was. Later, he invited me to join his band. We spent most of our time at the studio at the house. I would make tracks. I've done that for ages now. Actually, I worked on some this morning too. But when I'm not working on tracks, I try to leave the house to switch things up. My grandpa is a huge fan of classic Japanese songs. He always had something playing at his house. He'd have me sing and dance to them. I'd think it's amusing and dance along. I really enjoyed dancing, but it became more work than fun. I felt constrained that I won't be able to do what I enjoy. I wanted to do music. I wanted to do something with music. That's why I joined a band. My friend introduced me to a really great vocalist. That's how I got started. This feels like home. My family's from Shibuya. Although, I ended up moving. Actually, I ran away from home. My family structure is my father, my mother, me, my second brother, and my third brother. There are five of us. We all work in entertainment. What is your favorite gift from your father? I'd have to say genetics, I don't know. Other than that, I had lots of unique experiences since I was little. There are many things I'm grateful for, now that I'm older. I got fired from Johnny's when I was in the third year of junior high. Afterwards, well, I had to attend regular school. I hadn't studied at all, so I couldn't keep up with the curriculum. But I knew I had to get some sort of result. I attended cram school every day for a whole year. I'd stay there until nine, ten o'clock after school finished, then I'd come home and sleep. I did this for an entire year. That really felt like hell. After spending an entire year like that, I was at my limit. That's when I started to fool around. One time, I came home late. My parents came into my room and took all my tobacco and beer. When I came home, my parents spread them all over the room. They scolded me and my mom told me they're disowning me. I packed my bags and skipped over to Shibuya station. At that time, I was thrilled to get away from it all. I'm not quite sure when it was, but it was quite a while ago. I wore chains. How lame. Daddy. Here. I usually wake up between seven and eight in the morning. Usually, my children are already eating breakfast. This is how I spend my morning. On a weekday, I take them to kindergarten. After taking them to kindergarten, I get some time to relax, then I pick them up in the evening. -We then have lots of fun together. -Play, Daddy. This isn't a joke. To tell you the truth, my wife is giving birth tomorrow. I think I was an active child, I did all sorts of sports. I played baseball. I played baseball with my older brother and did tennis for about a year. Well, I ended up in a band just like my older brother. I was really into Japanese indies. Something like the melodic hardcore and punk scene like Hi-STANDARD. I was scouted within the first summer after moving to Tokyo. I was approached by my vocational school instructor. Well, he asked if I wanted to play drums for a good band he knows. That's how it started. But I… I was part of a band from back home, so I wasn't that interested. I wasn't too into it at first, but I figured I'd give them a try. We've been together since. In that medley, I think the core is the songs like "One Way Ticket" and "Clock Strikes." The positioning also makes it so it would be fun to attempt a mash-up. Something like a fusion of songs. We've never tried a mash-up. Combine two songs into one. A real mash-up. That would place a focus on these songs. and would make the other songs sound even better as well. You hear that? It's coming together nicely. But you want an idea to make it more interesting. Right, and it would be just right. Toru has his guitar riffs in the beginning, right? What if we add vocals? That sounds good. After that, if we want to make it even more complicated, what if the song is "Clock Strikes" before the audience realizes it? Sure. "Eye of the Storm" is a slower song. Also… What was that song called? I can't recall its name. And after that, -let's do what we've been talking about. -Right. But I like that song choice. -Yeah. -I like it. I can see it happening. Yeah, just play the main chorus. We made more progress today. I love the balance too. We can take it in either direction. It's easy to tell that we're playing a mash-up, whether you're listening in-person or through the livestream. Actually, the AR images have arrived. Let's review them. You mentioned something dramatic for "Mighty Long Fall" and using cutting-edge CG technology. This is how the visuals look so far. As far as what we are creating, as you can see… Well… In the real sense, the stadium collapses. Similar to the music video for "Mighty Long Fall." the stage collapses. What do you think? Well, it's different from our usual visuals. We wanted something that we could only achieve through special effects. The challenge is how we can make ONE OK ROCK's visuals even better. Fantasy-like yet violent imagery. That's what we aimed for. We can also create a dilapidated world and have you fly through such scenery. That was our idea. That wasn't exactly my image. These cyber-like images and completely otherworldly graphics aren't exactly our style. We would be in the midst of this, right? Yes, this is the stage. It feels like we're placed in a completely different world. The sky, the background, the venue, everything. I see. I'd like a fusion of the real world and AR. It would make more sense to do that. I understand. In our previous performance, one of the difficulties of the piano arrangement was that the transition to the next part was rather awkward. We need to make it smooth somehow. Since we're performing, we want to have an arrangement, right? -The start at least. -Sure. We also have a violin. Let's make it more gospel-like. I don't think I can sing to this. That's crazy good. Pianists are crazy good. I'm feeling self-conscious all of a sudden. What were we doing all this time? Right? We specialize in one type of music. No. Also, that jazzy chord in the last chorus, I want to use that somehow. Can I do that? Of course, I'd love that. This part is difficult. This is the best! If there was a song you were to do acoustically, would it be "Yokubou ni Michita Seinendan"? Yeah. We have various possibilities, but I love the image of playing a song on the audience seat. I want to find a way to make that visually appealing. Is this the entire view of the venue, Goto? How many meters wide is it? To the rear of the stage, I mean. It's 120 meters from one end to another. -120 meters! -Right. From the stage to this #2, it's about 100 meters. I believe so. Wouldn't it be crazy if we ran and sang on it? This is to help you visualize the stage. This is the environment where the camera can be at the front of the stage while you perform. We'll position some LED lights, just to have some light from above. So that the stage can be seen from the air. In a way, we had endless possibilities. Since we are in a stadium, we wanted to use it to the fullest. Yeah, I wanted to use the entire venue as much as we could. Since we have a massive venue, I wanted to use it all. -This is the tape. -This one? -Yeah. Oh, the other side. -Okay. Can you please put it away? Where are you going? Wait, mommy's leaving too? Mommy's going to the hospital. She's spending a night there. She's having a baby. Daddy's a good driver. Daddy, you got this. All right. I'll go put on a show! -What? -Tomorrow. Mommy's going to have a baby tomorrow. The baby inside mommy's coming out. He'll crack open? Crack open? What? Like a dinosaur egg? Then I'm off. Good luck! I'll do my best! Have a safe delivery! -See you later! -See you. -You got this. -Yeah. See you. I'm opening it up now. Can you carry it? Do you need any help? Well, you see… Let's not say that they're from me. They're from the members. What? This is just a show of our appreciation for you all. What are they? Those are Jojoen! They are from the members, not me. From the members? Yeah, I mean, I paid for them, but they are from all the members. Of course they are. Sure, I guess. -They're from the band members. -Thank you! -Thank you! -Thank you! Well, the ones Tomo brought and these Jojoen. That looks about right. We'll all smell the same after we eat these. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Hirakawa-san. -Yeah? How's the stage looking? We don't have recording equipment ready yet. Watanabe-san is setting them up right now. Can I hear how it's sounding? Can you raise the volume for the rhythm guitar? The sequence? Yeah, the sequence one. How does the sequence sound overall? The mash-up part? Including the mash-up. The audio with the songs together. Did you have the chance to listen to the original recording? Of course. Yes. The entire balance too. I've been working on it here and there. -I see. -I am trying to replicate it. Why does the music kind of sound flat overall? I used my phone to listen to the sample yesterday. That's how the audience will hear us. They'll either use phones or earphones or speakers for TVs. People who are more particular about music may have speakers like the ones here. Considering that, we've got to start fine-tuning the balance right now, or else, we won't make it in time for the performance. Usually, we have speakers all around the concert venue. We won't be doing that since there is no audience. I want everyone to hear ONE OK ROCK's actual sound through whatever speaker they're using. This is how it sounds over an iPad. And this is through an iPhone. Via a computer. And here's a basic speaker. And this is a high-end speaker music aficionados would own. We have to make all those assumptions as a team from the rehearsal stage and build our sound. It's a very difficult process, especially since the stage is so big. Should we try each track? Let's start at the medley and play all the songs. What's the best way to do this? Should we listen to them through the speaker? Or listen to the recorded songs and check for balance? Let's use the speakers. -What? -Yes. Let's do it. I'm tired. I'm getting back in my groove. I've forgotten how this all feels. This pre-tour feeling. I mean, before performing, there's so much information coming in and it's difficult to decide what to process first. He might be sleeping. -Hello? -Hey, it's me, Taka. -What? -This is Taka. -What is it? -Well, I was walking around Shibuya for a shoot and decided to show my face. Sure, come on in. No, I'm with a camera. It's fine. -Camera? -Yeah. -You're with a camera. -Okay. Will I be on camera? You will, but I can edit it out. -What? -I'll edit you out. I'm not dressed to be on screen. I'm dressed casually. Is that fine? Yeah. This is my father's mother. My grandma. I've never met her, but… Moriuchi's ancestors. Yeah, they're my ancestors. After I left home, the first time I saw my family was at a shop in Aoyama. I was a live-in worker. Not like I had anything else going on. That's when my father drives in with his Rolls-Royce. He scared my manager to pieces. A Rolls Royce driving through a tiny alleyway. It was during lunchtime, but my manager left the shop to give us space. We talked for the first time in forever then. That was the first time I saw my father after I ran away. I was glad he came to see me. Now that I look back on it… Well, you are my son. True. I'm always thinking about you. I heard about you, that you were working there. Well, you know, I also left my family when I was young. I know how it feels to be alone. I know how scary it can be. Though you have hopes and dreams, things don't always go the way you planned. It's easy to feel lost. So when you ran off, Taka, I knew it was hard for you to come back. I really understand how it feels to feel stuck in the middle like that. That's why I thought I had to visit you. I left as soon as I wrapped up work. That's right. I was on my way back from work. He only had 40,000 to 50,000 yen. And he gave me money. I told him to eat something nice with that money. That was a heart-breaking experience. My dad also left his home when he was my age. He worked by himself in bars and such in Tokyo. He sent that money to his mother. That's why he worked so hard. My father didn't want his own son to go through something like that. Who would have thought that your eldest son would repeat your mistake at the same age? Right? It makes me laugh. But it worked out in the end. Yeah, it turned out great. I've been thinking about this recently. There are many kinds of people, and we are all made differently. That's just how things are. We are all different. It was wrong of me to expect you to turn out like me. That's why I'm proud of you as your father and as another human being with all your accomplishments and everything else you do. I guess that's that. I still have long ways to go. Well, all we have is the present. Can't help that. You got me. I wasn't expecting you at all. I thought you were an Amazon delivery. I thought it was an Amazon delivery, but it's just you. Oh man, I can't hold it in. I can't sing through my tears. Thank you so much. "MOUICHIDO" I planned on speaking in an Osaka dialect, but I'll be formal once I see them. It's amazing. No, don't be so stiff. You're here to work on the camera. Thank you. This is Shota Shimizu. Good morning. Incredible. This is Ayaka. -Great to meet you. -Great to meet you! Great to meet you. -She's Aimer. -Great to meet you. Oh, everyone's here. She's Mao Abe. Please greet her. -Hello. -Hello. And this is KENTA. Hello! I'm not used to this, but I look forward to working with you. ONE OK ROCK is the most nervous one here. That's for sure. Well, I was quite nervous. I've never met most of them before, including the ones I've never spoken to. Ayaka? Never met her or spoken with her before, but we are only a year apart, so we're about the same age. Well, I wanted to do this with people around the same age. At least, the same generation, and to be more specific, people who entered music around the time that I did. KENTA from WANIMA? I've only spoken to him once before. I was quite sure that they didn't have a high opinion of me. But even then, I knew at heart that we could get along. That's why I reached out to them. I have a suggestion. The original sound… The part that Ayaka's singing… Mao, can you try singing that part? Okay, let's take this part from the top. Can we change the order here? Let's do that. Yeah. It was such a pain to divide up all the different parts. We had to rework the same line over and over again. That's when I realized I crammed too much. One song doesn't need this many singers. But it made me happy that they replied right away. I usually don't even contact them. They all agreed right away to cheer people up during the coronavirus pandemic. Okay. Let's go through it one last time. Just to be sure. KENTA, you're very emotional. Sorry about that. That's so pretty. That's amazing! We got a big one! I caught one! It's huge! Yeah! Did you see my shot? I finally came here. This is crazy. This is insane! Say, "Good morning," wearing this. Cheers. That looks delicious. Isn't it good? Very. Good work today! I love this. I love this series. Here. Wow! Why are you… Toru, stop. Don't fall asleep! Ikeda is the older one. He was in his teens. -I was about 17. -Right. When I first met Toru, there was a globe at the corner of the shop. He was spinning a globe like this. He said he'll tour around the world. He was pointing at capital cities all over the world. -No way! -So cool! -A high schooler? -Really? Did I do that? I mean it! You did that. I was like, "Can I really join a band with a leader like him?" You were messing with a globe? We have an international contract with Warner. We'll become an international band. We'll meet with the president of Warner. I'll meet with the top five of their company and convey my passion to them. -Who will? -I will. Well, it's that it's important to do as the Romans when you're in Rome, but I also want to live and die as a samurai. That's also important to me. That's our mission. We need to stand our ground as samurais and have them understand our ways. We'll learn what we can and fight our way in. This is crucial. If that's what it takes, then that's the last thing we should do with our lives. Yeah. Tomoya, break it here. -Oh, using the stand? -Yeah. I've been wanting to do that. Please do. Toru and Ryota, you can break them too. We have the king on our side. He is quite unpredictable. I trust him completely. We may not understand his ways, but Taka has a vision he's trying to follow through with. His comments and actions are based on that. We've been massively successful because of him too. There may be many people who can sing well, so you need to have multiple talents. Well, he is considerate of others but he's also charismatic. More than anything, he's got such a strong personality. Because Taka has gotten us this far, we've been able to enjoy playing in a band like this. We share a vision. We want to make it at a global level. We really want to do that. We understand each other and respect one another. Isn't that the best? I believe what we have is the best. If Toru never asked me to join his band, I wouldn't be here today. That's why I want to be with them. I want to keep communicating with the members. I want to keep having fun with this team. Cut! Great! That was the best! Should we play a new song? This ex-dancer's going to bust a move. You're trying to make us laugh. Don't look at us. No, I'm being serious. When ONE OK ROCK reveals a new song, I really don't know what direction to take it. Revealing a new song during a concert can seem disjointed. So adding these elements, like dancing, to the reveal event will leave a lasting impression. Can't do both legs. Just one. Just one leg is fine too. If you use both legs, the video might get blurred. Lower the right shoulder. No, that's not it. This guitar is quite high. Right shoulder. The guitar is positioned high. Can we go through it one more time? It's coming together now. It'll turn out great. Hey. Since we don't have many opportunities to gather together like this, I want to discuss the actual concert. We'll rehearse on the day before the concert. We'll rehearse the actual music for the first two hours. Then we'll rehearse the camera angles. That'll take about four hours. We'll also cover all the requests from the staff. Amazutsumi has compiled the tasks. Okay. We'll go over each song in detail as well as the direction you'll face at specific times. And then dress rehearsal at night. Okay. For the day after, which is the actual concert day, well, the vocalists will be here on the day of the event. So we'll rehearse that song at that time. Later on, we'll do a dress rehearsal one more time. Okay. And then, the actual event. We'll be very busy, so don't forget it. You're telling us to work to death. The songs were turning out great, but there were many factors we hadn't covered yet. We had many uncertainties such as AR and camera work that were up in the air until the very end. As we got closer to October, we felt more and more nervous. 2 DAYS TO GO A LINE message stating that we might be on the direct path came from Hirakawa-san of the PA team. He sent a screenshot of the typhoon's projected path. I couldn't believe it. I thought, "Seriously? A typhoon, now?" We're called a sunny band, but we couldn't see a way out of this one. We were in the direct line of a typhoon. It was possible for a typhoon to land on the day of the concert. Cool, so that's the LED light. Don't slip. I see the tent for the drums. I could only hesitate. A stadium with no audience. How are we supposed to get the excitement going? I really wasn't sure. There was no cheering either. Who are we supposed to play for? We won't know about the lighting until nighttime. But we did get one interesting e-mail from the president of Amuse Entertainment. He wanted us to look directly into the camera so that we can connect with the audience. His words really resonated with me. After that, I was able to realize that on the other side of the camera are the eyes of the audience looking directly at us. I decided to think of the camera as the audience's eyes. It feels pretty secluded. I'd like to play, but… How is it? Hard to play? Well, it's hard. The inside may be rusting. Let's not touch the main one. True. This graphic. Let me tell you before we get started. We're discussing reducing the amount of light particles. We did try it yesterday, Guess the visuals still turn out like this. It's very bare. What do you think? Will it look this bare and structural? The video you showed me of the curtain rising. It doesn't feel like AR at all. The angle, the color, everything. When the audience sees this, they'll think that it's some special effects through a camera. It doesn't look special. We can achieve this effect through other means. Well, my vision was a complete fusion of reality and AR. I'm not happy that it doesn't even look like AR. We have to make them believable in the real world. That's a matter of perception. The same can be said about colors. Yes, the equipment might be set up here, but the camera goes from point A to point B. That's all it's doing. It's not even making a complete circle. I'd understand if the camera went around all the way and we can feel the presence of the visual, but if this is the only angle you're using and the color is like this and even this part obviously cuts off, then wouldn't it look cheap? Oh, it's super slippery! Man, it sure is slippery. This is bad! I'll come up these stairs. The guitar is stored beneath the stage. Got it. There's the tent for the drums. It's so tall. It makes its presence known. Like I said, "We are" didn't work out. "Wasted Nights" is no good either. "Wonder" is impressive for a moment. "Wherever you are" only had one visual. None of it worked out. We don't know anything about AR. Because we don't understand AR, we don't know how they're set up or how they are implemented. The actual problem is that, well, the AR team was saying this too… It's their first time setting up AR at this scale. When we actually tried to do it, there weren't enough days and we found technical problems with camera work. There might be financial problems too, but it's nowhere near the level I hoped for. That's why I decided it's better to forgo them. Okay, everyone, go back to the waiting room for now. We'll rehearse in 30 minutes or so. Okay. -Look at this rain. -No AR. What? We won't use AR. Just for "We are"? -No. No AR. -What about "Wonder"? Yeah, it'll just be our live performance. So do your best. We got this. In a way, it helped me commit to performing. I thought it'll be like this anyway. In the end, ONE OK ROCK should be ONE OK ROCK. That's my conclusion. Sorry, it's raining and I've made lots of big adjustments to the plan. However, I'll do my best. Thank you for all your efforts, everyone. -Thank you. -Thank you. Hold on, the visuals aren't what we asked for. Let me check the visuals. This isn't what I asked for. This is no good. No good at all. No. None of that. What about this lighting? I feel like the rain is on our side right now. It looks pretty, but when the rain stops, we want to look more flashy. The lighting is directed below the band members. We can shoot you from above and it'll look very flashy. However, the stage just tends to look dim. We can dye the stadium with light or use searchlights to solve that. The light also seems dim. Can you… -Brighter? -Yeah, will that be difficult? Well, even the light we're using now is pretty bright already. Like I said, we can't let our guard down. -Even for a second… -Yeah, not even a second. If you let your guard down while my face is zoomed in, just that can ruin everything for the audience. You can't let your guard down. -The entire time. -The entire time. It's my first concert like this. That's why this is hard, but we have to do this. I'm a super fine weatherman. I'm besties with the sun. The hurricane made a U-turn. I've heard of the path changing or veering off, but not making a U-turn. I must say that my luck as the bestie of the sun made the storm turn around. Shake my hand. Shake my hand. What about a finger? What a nice breeze. You look great in it. We're going live in an hour and 15 minutes. Are we starting already? We were relaxing in the back for a minute and it was already time! I had to be standing on the stage before I braced myself for it. Over 100,000 viewers and counting. -Seriously? -100,000 viewers at this point. Okay! Let's do this. Hi, guys! Okay! There isn't an audience. Like I told you yesterday, don't let your guard down. Don't. Always be serious. Okay. It's been a while since we last performed. Let's give it our all. Let's deliver our music to the viewers. Thank you for today! Thank you! I'm counting on you! We're live! A livestream! Let's get started! It's time! It's time to get started! PLAN CHIME Perfect. Thanks. 100,000 people are viewing our performance! I thought it would be an incredible concert. I wanted to give it my all. The energy was crazy. Please. What garnered the most attention was the fact that it was streamed live. It was about what we can transmit in one shot within the given timeframe. I had no doubts about our performance. After all, we were planning for months. We can't think of things in simple steps. Our roots were to deliver our feelings and music. Thank you for today! Thank you. It's meaningful because it's only once. I was passionate about betting everything into this performance. I had a lot of thoughts during it and I didn't know how I'd feel at the end of it all. I was ready to give my life for this concert. All right. Great, everyone's here already. Okay, everyone. Thank you for today. One minute left. Thank you for today. We're going live in a second. Okay. Four… Last two songs. Though it was short, thank you for joining our livestream. We lost many precious things during this time. Hopefully, we will, and you will too, have many more doors open from now on. So please don't give up. We always repeat this message, but it feels a little different to say it now. We'll put our thoughts into the last two songs and then end our livestream. I know we'll see each other again. I believe we will. I'll keep waiting for that day to come. So please let me put my all into these two songs. Everyone on the other side of the screen. Please sing with me. Are you ready? Are you ready? It sometimes felt like there were no dreams or hopes during this time, but as long as we keep pushing forward, we'll always find a way. There's no way that the way things are is okay. The effect life has on us, the challenges, the change in time. So please stay alive, no matter what. Experience life to its fullest and tell your loved ones how you feel. Got it, you guys? Thank you, everyone, for watching tonight. I'm really grateful that you're here. I hope I'll see you again. First, I'd like to introduce the wonderful performers who joined us for this special online concert tonight. Violinist, Emiri Miyamoto. Keyboard, Gakushi. Also, the dancers who joined us for "Change." Thank you, everyone from PLAN CHIME! And [re:]project members who joined us despite the busy schedule! Thank you! I'll never forget about today. So that you don't forget about this night, keep believing there will be a next time. Please live a healthy life until we meet again. I promise we'll overcome this distance. One day. We made it to the credits. You're offline. Thank you so much! That took years off of my life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Congratulations! How did you feel? Your performance was spectacular. What about a monthly performance? Oh, no! that was really a one-time occasion. That's why we did it. If we had to do it again, I'd take 20 years off of my life. See, that makes it much more difficult. I never want to do it ever again. I think I answered that already. No. Well, I sure don't feel like doing it again. Especially not monthly. That's what I mean. Next time, I hope to see you all at a concert. See you then. See you then. It really feels like things are changing rapidly. Especially during this coronavirus pandemic, there are things worth chasing after even if I have to sacrifice myself. I want more strength. No matter what occupation people have, I hope we all reach out to each other once this pandemic is over. And the kids who grow up after the time of the coronavirus will think, "What's up with these old geezers," and start a new era. Until that time comes, it's up to us to build our own era. That's what I think. Subtitle translation by: Megumi Hunter
