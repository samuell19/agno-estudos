Hey it's a wild idea, let's go down to the 'go-gos' and cause a little trouble, huh? Are you serious? That's, three miles away! Oh baby, it'll be good for ya. Harry, the overnight bags! Hey besides, there's this broad down there that I've always had my eye on, what's her name? Uh, uh, Nancy! Nancy or something or the wait a minute. (soft daydreaming music) (dog whines) When do your parents get back in town, huh? They're spending the night in Los Angeles. They phoned. Oh. There's a big landslide up the road. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll bet you are. Hey, Mike! Look what I got. Am2Su, HcSoF, and Magnesium Sulfate. How about that, Mike? That's very impressive, Genius. They're not compatible. This is supposed to blow up. I wonder why it doesn't? You and I aren't going to be very compatible either, Genius, if you don't get out of here. Mike, I don't know what you see in her. I don't know either. But, uh, whatever it is, I like it. Oh you're good for me Nancy, you know that? You are very, very good. I never knew you liked good girls. I don't. They talk too much. So? So, stop talking so much. (explosion booms) (substances bubbling) That's not really what I was trying to do. Genius, are you all right? Of course I'm all right. Why shouldn't I be? Well you could have been killed. [Genius] Oh, nonsense. Well, you could have. [Genius] I put an electric charge to that stuff I was mixing, and then pow, the whole place blew up! I wonder what that is. Do you think it might be ammonia-actride sulfate? No. It's either pancake mix, or an octopus. (cat meows) What a mess. All right, Genius, put your talents to cleaning this up. Go get a broom. The things this kid comes up with. Fantastic! [Nancy] I suppose. Anyway, he does keep things from getting dull, if he just wouldn't overdo it. (cat chomping) Shoo. Go on, beat it. (cat meows) Mike!! You nearly stepped on it. On what? You might have set it off. You really must be more careful. His burglar alarm. How's it work? Pretty good? I don't know. I never really tried it out. Only in theory. In theory, it works fine. Well, build a better mousetrap, and they'll beat a path to your door, they always say. Not mouse trap, burglar trap. I'm going to patent it. Am I nuts or something? (cat growls) (tense music) If you are, we all are. (cat growls) Go get him, Woof. Sic em, ' boy! (Woof barks) (cat growls) (Woof barks) [Genius] Atta boy Woof, sic em'! That cat was eating that. What've we got here? I suppose the correct name would be ammonia actride sulfate, diethyl chloricin. Perhaps we ought to call it Goo. Would that be simpler? No, not really. You know what? What? We're gonna make us a million bucks. (ducks quacking) (expanding jingle) With the price of beef what it is today, can you imagine if you fed this to cattle, or to chickens? Five, six times this size! Imagine the money. Genius, the first thing you gotta do is make some more of this stuff. If he can remember what he made it from. Of course I can! (ducks quacking) (ducks quacking) The first thing we do is patent the formula. First we find it. Market it. Can you imagine the problems we're gonna solve? Unlimited food supply at practically no extra cost! Oh, and we gotta keep this secret, absolutely secret. Of course. (Woof barks) Alright, Woof. (dramatic music) (Woof barks) Well, come on in. He must have eaten some of the Goo when you fed the du... Oh, Mike! The ducks are gone! Our secrets flown the coop! Okay to leave my stuff here? [Fred] Yeah, why not? They closed this place down, nobody comes here anymore. [Jean] Boy I was sure dirty. I'm glad we found this place to clean up in. (swords clanking) [Merrie] Hey aren't you guys ready yet?

(duck quacking) (upbeat dance music) Hey, listen. Pete's got a great idea. Harry asked the vital question: What they've been feeding those ducks? So? Well, it's some sort of a food additive, obviously. Well it couldn't be anything else, could it? They're keeping it a secret. A million-dollar secret they said. I like the sound of it. Thought you'd like that. Now, tell you what you're gonna do, it's gonna be very simple. Come on. (Fred whispering) [Mike] Okay, wattusi out of here. (substance bubbling) (substance pouring) (glass exploding) (Woof barks) Interesting, but not quite what we wanted. (Genius sighs) Okay, while the Beau Brummels take a break, it's record time. (light cheerful music) Okay? Sure. Don't you want to dance? Waiting for my girl. Bird in the hand, they always say. They say it's good for the figure, the jerk. Must be. How'd you get into town, anyway? The roads out. We walked down, all the way from the slide. It's a long walk. They say it's good for the legs. That's what they say. One Coke, please. Yes. Thank you. Say, they got a pretty good crowd here tonight. Uh, yes. Here you are, honey. I never saw anyone do that before. You got to have strong hands. I guess. Muscles are very important to me. Oh really? Oh yeah. What is it, some sort of vitamin? Vitamin? The stuff that made the ducks grow like that. Oh, yeah, that. Well, I guess you could, call it a vitamin if you wanted to. Like a pill of something? Yeah, yeah that's right. No I spend a lot of my time keeping around sides of beef, my old man's in the meat business in Los Angeles. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. A 400-pound side of beef over your shoulder really does tighten up your muscles, let me tell you. He's about the biggest in the business, I guess. My old man, I mean. Oh, yes. Yeah, you ought to see the size of his place, God. Got an idea: You and I, are gonna dance, little lady. Uh, wait a minute. Come on now, this is good music, this is the kind of stuff you don't like to dance to, you know? I bet you've got it hidden away some place. Sure we do. Like it's a secret? Like it's a secret. You wouldn't mind telling me, would you? I don't know, I'll have to think about that. Tell me? Getting better. Almost made up my mind for me. Hey uh, I just thought of something. You're supposed to be dancing, not thinking. Yeah, I was just thinking, right? Now this stuff that you guys came up with, like you'll need some help, won't ya? Mike knows what he's doing. Yeah but in a hick-town like this, I mean if you knew somebody in town, somebody in Los Angeles, somebody who really knows the business- Someone like you're old man. Exactly, right, right! I'd take him some of this stuff, see what I mean, and it would just be amazing what this old man can do- I see exactly what you mean. Please? Just one more time, and I think I'll make up my mind. There. We got a deal? Are you gonna tell me? The price is about right. But you're just a shade too eager, to pay it. Now, come on the level, honey, now come on, I'm trying to do something for ya, I wanna help ya. Why? Why? I guess it's just because I can't resist helping somebody I like that's all. And, uh, you: I like. It's as simple as that. What about your girlfriend, what's-her-name? Who, Merrie? Oh come on baby, she's not my girlfriend, she's, uh, she's one of the group that's all. One of the group. Come here. Suppose you and I take that stuff into Los Angeles, together. Just the two of us just you, and... Mike, baby. Listen, we were just, it's amazing we were just talking about this stuff - that you just- - Beat it. Oh. (gentle music) How do you like those ducks? Barbecued, that's how I like them. (people chattering) [Fred] Boy, that's a big enough duck for you, eh? Ohh, big duckie! Yeah, looks pretty good, eh? Come great strong warriors, turn almighty duck! Yeah, you like this, huh? [Pete] Big bird, huh? (fountain murmuring) You guys find a place to sleep? Hmm? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're campin' out at the old theater. It's good a place as any, I guess. Uh, yeah.

There's not much of it and they want me to make some more. But it's not easy. Why don't we, go for a walk, Genius? I'll buy you an ice cream cone. I never touch it, it's high in cholesterol, but I'll go for a walk with you. Okay! They were trying really hard to find out about the Goo, weren't they? Guess they can smell a profit. Guess this ought to be safe enough. (glass crashing) [Nancy] What did you break? Hm? [Nancy] Didn't you break something? Wasn't that you? No. (suspenseful music) (Nancy screams) (tense music) (dramatic tense music) Mike! Put that fool thing down. (water hissing) Get off the ground, get up the stairs, get up the wet floor!

(both chuckling) (Mike, Fred fall) (tense music) (Mike, Fred punching) (all grunting) Hey! Who's the Size 40? (energetic music) [Red] Well, they sure don't make em' like they used to. [Nancy] No stamina at all. Who won? We did. Don't we always? Yeah, that's uh... Who got the Goo? They got it. One of them ran off with it. I was going to stop him, but- But what? Reasons of pure logic: He was bigger than me. Holy smoldering crawdads. Don't worry, as soon as I find the formula, I'll simply make some more. I just hope you can. Sure I can, there's nothing to it. Just a matter of perseverance. (levers clanking) And then there was light. Man, while that lasted it was a pretty good rumble. Anyone get hurt? Fred! Ah no, uh, two more minutes and I'd have flattened him. Okay, now we got it. What're we gonna do with it? We get rich, that's what we do with it. Hey, I wonder if this makes, everything grow, huh? Ha-ha. You mean like, um, plants, and, things? No, I don't think that's what he means at all. Hey, don't be a jerk, huh? What's the matter Fred? Running scared? Yeah, he's scared. No, I just got more sense is all. You always said you wanted to be a big man, now's your chance (chuckles)! Yeah, a real big man. (chuckles) Unless you're scared. Show him Fred. Show him that you're not no chicken. Hey, will you cut it out? Hey, yeah, yeah, that's a wild idea, man. Yeah, that's what you think I am, chicken, huh? Are you? Merrie? Are you out of your mind? Hey, will you cut it out, and leave it alone, huh!? Listen to me, Freddy-boy, if I want to try some of this stuff, just don't you try and stop me, understand? You're some kind of, coward. What, are you trying to prove something, huh, is that it? Yeah. I'm trying to prove you're all talk. All talk, and no performance. Pete, you better do something... Pete? No, why should I? This'll be very interesting. Yeah, yeah eh-you want to try some of it, huh? I will if you will. Mm-mm, you're on the spot, lover. No! [Merrie] Shut up. [Fred] All right, give me your knife, huh? Come on. Huh? Let's see there's two, four six, eight of us. That's eight pieces. (tense music) Two, three, four, five. Not me Fred, heh, count me out. You too honey, just like the rest of us. We all take it. Well come on take it. And nobody chickens out, alright? Nobody! Well, eat it honey, don't be scared. (Elsa gasps) (tense music) (buttons popping) (clothes ripping) (clothes ripping) (dramatic music) What's the matter hotshot, don't you like your new size? I was big enough before. Huh-look what happened to us. And all these girls can think of is their modesty! (Laughs) Fred! Fred, what have we done?! Well whatever it is, we're stuck with it. "Stuck with it." So why don't we make the most of it? It's gonna make a difference. Yeah. I was just thinkin'. Wait til' my old man gets tough with me again, huh? We're freaks, Rick. Maybe we are, but you just wait'll the next guy asks me for my I.D. card. Oh, boy! (Laughs) Now maybe it won't be so easy for them to kick us around anymore. Yeah! Them? The adults, honey. This isn't their world anymore, it's gonna be ours! Yeah, we'll turn the tables on them. Come on, let's split, and have some fun, huh? [All] Yeah! Let's get out of here, huh? Right. But I don't have anything to wear! Be my guest. (machine rattling) (crowd murmuring) (dramatic music) (crowd murmuring) (Fred and Merrie chuckling) Hey, now what happened to the music? Let's wail! Yeah, come on, let's dance. (rhythmic music) Fred, tell her to put him down. (Fred laughs) (chair crushes) (Fred screams) Tell her to put him down or I'll beat the daylights out of ya! (Fred smacks) [Nancy] Mike? Now, let's cut it out, huh? I mean you little guys are taking this all wrong, we're on your side. All of us against the adults. Now how about that, huh? We're taking over them. And you regular guys are gonna be part of this, we're just gonna help you. Yeah, well what if we don't want to be a part of it? How can you say that, I mean, haven't they kicked you around long enough? Maybe we don't like your club either! You're in it anyway. Hey listen, you have nothing to worry about. Because when we've taken over, ama- Oh I'm already worried, I'm worried about how funny you really are. "When we take over," huh? Why you're just trying to trade places with them is all. It's the same result, if you had any brains you'd see that! Hey man, this guy's a lousy rebel. Yeah, look, whether you like or not, little man, we're just gonna have to show you what's good for you, that's all. What's good for all of us teenagers. Hm? (police siren wailing) All right, kids, listen. I've received a lot of complaints by the telephone that there's just a little too much noise- Sheriff. I think I'm seeing things. Yeah, I'm seeing 'em, but I don't like 'em. Now everybody go back, go home, and- Sheriff. Up there. Why can't you take care of things- For crying out loud, now what's this? Your guess is as good as mine. Listen I don't pretend to understand what's going on around here, but it's just been brought to my attention that the theater was broken into last night, and I got a pretty good idea who did the breaking in too. I want you to go back to the theater and wait there. Why don't you shut up and go home, Sheriff? (teens chuckle) Now listen you do like I say you go back and wait there for me, do you understand, is that clear? Anything you say Sheriff, you're the boss. Unless, how long do you think it would take me to bend that rifle around your neck, Sheriff? (Laughs) Or why don't we just step on them? Both of them! Yeah, why don't I do that? I never did like the fuzz and that old- Okay, man, okay, okay. Hm? Sure, Sheriff, there's no problem. Still a coward, eh? Do like he says, Rick. Leave him alone. Let's get back. (huffs) You little. Now Sheriff, listen, you really are a big man. At least ah, you were until we came. But like you say we'll go right back to the theater. No guns you have to worry about, nothing. Mike, you all right? Yeah, sure. It just feels like I've been hit by a ton of bricks. Oh, Mike! Ah, it's okay, it's all right. Don't worry about it. (uneasy music) How'd you sleep honey? You get a good rest? Mm-hm! But Fred, what's gonna happen to us? I don't know, uh, as long as it lasts, I guess we'll have to live with it. Let me do the talking. I want the rest of you men to wait here. Hello, freaks. Hello. They're coming. Mike and the Sheriff. He's got a gun. A gun? Yeah. No sweat, it's been taken care of. You get her? Yep. Where is she? Out of sight. Hey now what is happening!? You'll see. We got ourselves some insurance. I'm hungry too. What's for breakfast? Sheriff, on toast. (all chuckling) Morning Sheriff, Mike. All right, let's get one thing clear. Like I said, I don't understand what's happened and I'm not gonna worry about it. But last night you people showed me the kind of trouble we can expect from you. And this kind of town trouble is one thing I just won't have. I want you all pack up and get out of town, that's an order. I want you all out of town within an hour, is that clear? Just get out and don't come back. Yeah, well, that's clear enough, Sheriff, only we kind of like it here, you know, we kind of figure we might stay. And there's nothing you can do about it. Nothing. Well, you just do what I say or else there'll be some trouble. Oh no kidding, what kind of trouble, Sheriff? You aiming to use that gun? If I have to, yes. Sheriff, how many guns do you have in this town, huh? Look, that's no concern of yours, you're leaving. Oh don't make book on it. When Fred wants something, he usually gets it. Dont'cha, honey(giggles)? You better believe it. What makes you think I can't arrest you? Oh now Sheriff, you'd shoot me in cold blood? Mike, there's a coil of rope in the corner, will you get it for me, please? This is gonna be mighty interesting. (Chuckles) How was your daughter when you left her this morning, Sheriff? Show him, Rick-boy. Daddy! Daddy! Make him put me down! Please, Daddy! Go ahead Sheriff, use your gun, cut me down. (Cora whines) But if you miss, you might hit this loud, screaming little brat of yours. Cora, Cora dear, be still, don't move. That's not such a bad idea. Well, I don't like it, see, and I am the guy that gives the word around here. Like I said, Boss, we got ourselves some insurance. Something we need. They brought guns, remember? Just like always, "keep the kids in line." Okay, okay. But I don't like it. Oh, Pete! Don't worry, nobody's gonna hurt her. As long as the Sheriff is gonna play ball with us. All right. (gun drops) I won't argue with you. (gun drops) There's my guns. Rick, uh, are you sure you know what you're doing? Put her down now! Okay. Anything you want. You hear that, Fred? "Anything we want," that's what he said. All right, man, all right. Now, Sheriff, we are going to take over this town and we are gonna make quite a few changes. Now first of all, there's gonna be a nine o'clock curfew for all adults. How do you like that, huh? You'll all have freedom of speech, just as long as we approve of what you say. A working part is going to have to find food for us everyday. And well needless to say our appetites are gonna be pretty big, hm? In fact, why don't we start with something right now, huh? Mike, why don't you get me some chicken? Why don't you- Mike, Mike, Mike. Okay, come on, boy, jump to it. Mike come on, there, that's a boy, yeah. Do what he says, Mike. Now, Rick, Harry, now you guys know what you gotta do, huh? Now I want you to take care of all the communications, knock out the telephones, radios, everything you see, all right? [Cora] Put me down! Cora, everything will be all right. All right, I'll say it again, anything you want. Bring her down. No, she stays right here. Now, you do just as you're told, Sheriff, and nobody is gonna get hurt. And one more thing, Sheriff. We want all the guns in the town brought here. Is that clear!? Then I'll take my child home? We'll take care of her, Sheriff. Yeah, we'll take care of her, just as long as you do as you're told. (Cora crying) You see, Fred-boy? All it takes is a little cooperation. We're really gonna take over this town. (substances bubbling) (suspenseful music) Well, back to the old drawing board. (Sighs) I'll have to remember to try that again sometime. (Woof barks) (substance pouring) You'll regret this! You mark my words! Save your bad temper, Sheriff, 'til you can find a better use for it. Mike, you are amazing, man, really you're doing just fine, I don't think I could do any better myself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We might even put you in charge of supervising the adults. (both chuckling) Hey, why not, man, really. You and a few of your friends, we'll put you in charge of checking adult I.D. cards, huh? You know, just kind of keeping an eye on their social activities, make sure they keep out of trouble and, you know, hm? And our music, they've gotta leave it alone. Oh, quite definite. Yeah, yeah. Hey uh, man, what're you just standing there for, huh? De-part, man. Leave. (teenagers chuckling) It's up to us now, Horsey. There's only one thing we can do. But there's nothing we can do, Mike. Not while they've got a hostage. That's just it: We got to get a hostage of our own. (rhythmic music) (horn blasting) (tires squealing) (motor revving) (energetic music) (tires screeching) (cars rumbling) (Fred screaming) (energetic music) (tires screeching) Okay! Go! (car top thuds) (screams) Mike! Mike, Mike!! Let me go, I'll kill him! Okay, fellas, you want me to leave her up there or shall I pluck her down for ya? What'll it be? (dramatic music) I heard the noise, I figured you might need some help. Boy they almost got you, didn't they? Nearly got me. Take her down, take her to the theater. From now on she's gonna stay with us. Well, there's only one thing we can do. We gotta get those guns. Right. Basically, the problem is this: How to get into the theater, and get the guns without getting discovered. And how to put the guard, whoever that may be, out of action, long enough to recover the hostages with the guns. That's not going to be so easy. If we try to pull anything, who knows what's liable to happen to that child, or to Nancy? Mike, there's nothing we can do! Yeah, we're on our own. The road's still closed. They don't even know outside what's going on in here. On our own is right, the Sheriff sure isn't much help. Not much he can do under the circumstances. Yeah, that's why it's up to us, we got to raid the theater. Oh no. They always seem to leave just one guard on duty, sort of like a sentry. Mike, we'll never get away with it. We will. And there's just one thing we need: Ether. Ether? Genius, we need your brains! I thought you'd need me sooner or later. Do you know how to make Ether? That depends what kind you need. Psyclopople, Methol, Ethanpople, Poponeil ethel, Or Psyclopople Vinylethel. These are all fairly easy. If you want Dibynoxide, it might be a little more difficult. Trichlorethylene, of course, is terribly complicated. Any good anesthetic. I have nitric acid and calcium chloride. If you give me some vodka, I can make you some Diethylene then very easily. Vodka? Dig this crazy kid. Or whiskey. Any kind of alcohol really. If I were a little older, of course. Yeah. Yeah, we know about that. Hey, don't we have some alcohol in the first aid kit? Yeah, I'll get it. But even so, if we're disturbed. We won't be. Mike, you can't be sure of that. The main thing is to keep the rest of them away, keep them occupied. Red's come up with a scheme to keep the boys occupied. Don't worry. The way I plan it, the boys'll be watching me. And then? We got a problem with giants, right? Right. Ever heard of, David and Goliath? (rhythmic energetic music) Hey, have some chicken, man! Yeah. Wild stuff. She really knows how to move, doesn't she? Baby, I wish I was your size again. (boys chuckling) Go, go. Some chicken, Nancy? Daddy wouldn't let him hurt us, would he? Would he, Nancy? No, of course not, honey. Everything's gonna be all right. Now you don't have to be sore with me, honey. Did you see what they tried to do to me? They could have killed me with those hot rods. You're lucky they didn't. They should have. Now will you please not talk like that, huh? You know how I feel about you. Then let us go. Both of us. I can't know better than that. You see, in this town, for the first time in my life, I'm a big man, in more ways than one. You know how it is at our age, honey, "don't do this, don't do that, don't-don't-don't-don't-don't." It's like it's the only word they know how to say. "Don't drink, don't smoke, don't drive too fast." The only word they know how to use. Well, I'll tell you something, you see, in this town, the authority is all mine. And nobody is gonna say don't to me for anything. Okay, you're a rebel. I'm impressed. Well, you better be. (contemplative music) (sling swooshing) (window shatters) (sling swooshing) (window shatters) Hey Fred! We've got a visitor! (sling swooshing) What's he trying to do? Trying to show what a big man he is. (sling swooshing) Why don't I just pick him up and throw him away? Stomp on him'd be more like it. No, he's cute! He wants to fight! Okay, Goliath, here's your spear. Go kill him. You're all guts, Fred! (sling swooshing) All right. You're no better with a spear than I am with a sling! Well, don't make Booka. Go on, Fred, teach him! That's exactly what I'm going to do. (tense music) Nice try, Goliath! Come on, quick! Anybody want some candy? Not now! Let's go! Merrie, get in there and watch that kid. But I wanna watch. Don't worry, I'm gonna give you his head on a silver platter. That was Samson and Delilah. Go on, get in there. I'm gonna cut you in pieces, little man. Come on, baby, this'll be better than the ball game. That boyfriend of yours is gonna get the daylights beaten out of him. And how do you like that? (Giggles) (tense music) Nancy, loo- Don't try anything, honey, you just stay right there, and you'll be all right. Okay, I'm gonna need both hands for this. (sling swooshes) (Fred grunts) (sling swooshes) (tense music) [Horsey] Bombs away! (Merrie gasping) That's all for that, now for those guns. I've got to get to Mike. Chuck, take the girl home, will you? Right. Woof, we've come up with another Pumice compound. Failed again. Hey don't do that! Keep away! (Woof barks) (descending jingle) Doesn't work on me. (Woof barks) Woof, I have some quite astounding news for you. Fortuitously perhaps, we have discovered the antidote, and there must be something we can do with it, wouldn't you say? (Woof barks) (tense music) (stick crashes) Missed again! Come on, Goliath! (tense music) Oh, she'll warn em'! After her, quick! What do we do if we catch her? (sling swooshes) (tense music) Hey Fred, look. (tense music) (descending jingle) Just a little bit more, Freddie-boy. Yeah that's right, just a little bit more. (Mike punches) How'd you like that, Goliath? All right. Well, back down to size, huh? Where's your tailor, Freddie? You need some adjustments, right? Hey, hey! We're goin', huh? Just leave us alone! Leave us alone! (upbeat music) Well, we've got a long, long, long walk. [Man] Uh, beg your pardon. Are you people coming from Hainesville? Yes, we're coming from Hainesville. [Man] Is that the place where they have the Goo? Yes, that's the place where they have the Goo. [Man] Thank you so much. (light confused music) (dramatic cheerful music)
