(MultiCom Jingle) (rhythmic instrumental music) (singing in foreign language) (water splashes) (singing in foreign language) (rhythmic music) - Good morning to the O family. (rhythmic music) (singing in foreign language) (elephants trumpet) (beeping) (water splashes) (rhythmic music) (beeping) (elephants trumpet) (slow rhythmic music) (elephant trumpets) Damn. - The Shongwedzi's very famous for its elephants. Many elephants. It is one of the biggest elephant game parks in South Africa. (horn beeps) (slow rhythmic music) (helicopter whirs) - [Man] That's Askari. He's a rogue elephant. (elephant trumpets) (slow rhythmic music) The only survivor when his herd was culled. (elephant trumpets) (helicopter whirs) (rhythmic music) (singing in foreign language) - We've seen enough, Joss. It's what we thought. There's too many of them down there. (singing in foreign language) (rhythmic music) - But we haven't even finished the survey. - Exactly, Joss. The numbers are already far in excess of the '98 figures. If it's obvious to me, it must be obvious to you. We are getting too many elephants. - These conditions are temporary. As soon as the rain starts-- - In optimum conditions, they'll breed even faster. If we don't set the limits now and stick to them, we're going to be in serious trouble. - Culling, Patrick, the board is against culling. They publicly stated that. - Everybody's against culling. Who wants to kill the elephants? But you only have to look at the evidence to see we are facing a crisis situation. - Well it looks like you've already made up your mind. What about the other opinions? - There's a board meeting on Wednesday, and I want to convince them that we need urgent and drastic action. Joss, I know you are in a difficult position on this, with your wife and her connections with animal rights. - I make my own decisions. You should know that. - You mentioned other opinions. - I said options. - There are no other options, Joss. - What about relocation? We could sell some animals to other game parks. - Maybe we could, but it takes time to find these people, and time is running out, Joss. - I have plenty of contacts with other parks. Somebody's bound to need some elephants. - Maybe a few. What about the rest? - For God's sakes, Patrick, give me a chance to double check the numbers. - Okay. And once we've done that, then we'll talk again. Oh, of course I'm counting on your discretion, and this is just between the two of us. Do not tell your wife. (solemn instrumental music) (birds chirp) (slow instrumental music) - Emma, welcome. - Hi. - I see you took the shuttle. Your Aunt Paula must've been delayed. - Yeah. - How was your flight, did you get some rest? - No, not really. - Well, you can relax here. (speaks foreign language) Well, I'm sure you wanna freshen up. We made up your room if you want to rest. - Joss! Joss. - What is it? - The fence is down at the Lower Zabi. - Damn it, not again. Go get the Land Rover, while I show Emma to her room. (buzzing) (beeping) (slow instrumental music) (bird chirps) - Shut up, sorry. Shut up, you. Shut up, you. - Shut up, yourself. - Pretty bird. (squawking) (slow instrumental music) - Bye! - Bye, sweetheart, bye! - Bye, bye! - We'll miss you, sweetie. (slow instrumental music) (helicopter whirs) (slow instrumental music) (footsteps tap) (bird squawks) - Emma. Darling, I lost track of time. (gentle instrumental music) - I don't have a home anymore. (engine rumbles) - Here it is. (birds chirp) - White rhino, probably Casius. (beeps) - Joss calling base, Joss calling base. Do you copy, Russell? - [Russell] Copy, Joss, what's up? - Well, we've had another breakout. Savuti Flats, just below Manana Pools. - [Russell] Again? I'll send a team right away. Do we know who it was? - [Joss] Yeah, it was probably Casius. We need to find him quickly though before Ripshaw does. - [Russell] How fresh are the tracks? - [Joss] Probably yesterday, miles away. - [Russell] Okay, Joss, you go after him, we'll take care of the fence. - [Joss] Thanks, buddy. Over and out. - Ndhlovu. (chuckling) (tense instrumental music) Bingo. (chuckles) We got one. (soft chattering) Well go and fetch the count, let's go. He's paid to kill a rhino, so let's go get one. - Anything? - Still wet. He's close, boss. (dramatic instrumental music) (singing in foreign language) (slow instrumental music) - There you are. (slow tense music) (gun fires) (birds squawk) - Oh, no. (tense instrumental music) (camera clicks) - Nice one. - Isn't it? (bird chirps) Cut off the head for a trophy. (engine rumbles) (flies buzz) (chainsaw rumbles) (thuds) - (sighs) Damn it. (slow instrumental music) Okay. (slow instrumental music) I know. It had to be Casius. (slow instrumental music) (clanking) (slow instrumental music) Ripshaw, who else? (slow instrumental music) (door clicks) (footsteps tap) So, what would you like to do tomorrow, Emma? - Nothing. - Well, you must want to do something. - Okay, um, how 'bout a movie and a trip to the mall with my friends? Or maybe I'll watch the TV you don't have. - Well, there's plenty of other things you could do around here. You can go on a nice walk. - And get eaten by lions, good idea. - Why don't you go with your Aunt Paula to see the elephants? - No, you know, I wouldn't want to put you guys out, like, picking me up from the airport, or anything. (footsteps tap) - I was working. - You're always working. (door thuds) (gentle instrumental music) Sometimes I think all you care about are those damn elephants. - At least I care! - You can't hide behind them anymore, Paula. They're not the only life here. That girl needs you, she needs special attention. - Really? - I know. I'm sorry. But she has to be your priority now. She needs you. - Yeah, I know. (bird chirps) (buzzing) (door thuds) (owl hoots) (buzzing) (smacking) - Ndhlovu. Over population, mismanagement, corruption, that's Africa. What chance have the poor, bloody animals got against this lot? So what I say is this, shoot them while they're still around. 'Cause if you don't, somebody else sure as hell will. (soft chattering) (spits) (gentle instrumental music) (birds chirp) - Morning. (gentle instrumental music) Very well, thanks, you? (gentle instrumental music) Good, well have a nice day then. Thanks, I will. (gentle instrumental music) Bye. (gentle instrumental music) (tense instrumental music) (sighs) (helicopter whirs) (knocking) - Emma. - What? - I'm sorry. It was insensitive of me over there. Emma, you have to forgive me. I spent a lot of time on my own out there. It's not easy to share it with someone else, but I'd like for you to come out with me. Please. - Don't do me any favors. - Emma, please. (gentle instrumental music) (exciting instrumental music) (elephants trumpet) (exciting instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) (beeping) (gentle instrumental music) - [Emma] She's the matriarch, the boss. It's okay, they know me, they know the vehicle. - He's the baby. His name's Ollie. He's okay. No, don't touch. They can touch us, but we don't touch them. Hi. (gentle rhythmic music) (elephants roar) Ollie's mom. (elephants trumpet) (beeping) - Why do all their names begin with O? It's easier for computer logging. There are over 30 kinship groups in this sector alone. There was family group A, family group B. This is the O family. This is your favorite family, right? - Yeah. (gentle rhythmic music) (keyboard keys clicking) - We try to stay out of their lives as much as possible. We watch, we learn, we never feed them. Even if they get sick or wounded by lions, we don't interfere. We leave it to Mother Nature. Does the same rule apply to people? (beeping) (helicopter whirs) - [Joss] Government land. 80 square kilometers of perfect elephant habitat. - Yes, I know. - Well, we could buy it and move the elephants here. - How many times must I say we can't afford it? - Our income was up last year. Tourist figures are increasing. - Joss, look, if we could buy the land, which we can't, I would still have to pay for the electric fence, for more rangers to patrol the area, for more land management facilities and for, that's the way it is, Joss. (dramatic rhythmic music) (animals braying) (bird squawks) (elephants trumpet) (helicopter whirs) (elephants trumpet) - Hey! (helicopter whirs) (elephants trumpet) Patrick? (dramatic instrumental music) (helicopter whirs) (explosive booming) (helicopter whirs) What's wrong? (gentle instrumental music) I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. - No, no, obviously. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) - Askari. (elephant trumpets) Hang on! (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant roars) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) (tense rhythmic music) You okay? - Yeah. What was his problem? - That was Askari. He's angry. - He's angry, wait until I see him again. (gentle instrumental music) - [Paula] That's the A family. - You mean to say they shot all these elephants? Oh my God. The whole A family? - [Paula] Askari's the only survivor. (gentle instrumental music) (buzzing) (soft chattering) (buzzing) (playful instrumental music) (buzzing) - Can you teach me that one? Us country boys don't get to learn the new dance steps, you know? - Didn't anyone ever teach you not to sneak up on people? - Well, you should be more alert. I could've been a lion or a leopard. - You look more like a mangy stray. - Ooh, now you've hurt my felines. (chuckles) So, what ya doing? - Watching Discovery Channel. What does it look like? (soft chattering) - 'Kay. I'll leave you to it. I've seen this one before. (soft chattering) (sizzling) - Thank you. (gentle instrumental music) - So, why were you in the helicopter today? - Nothing, just looking for poachers. - Then why was Patrick up there with you? - We were just. - Hmm? - Yes, I was counting elephants. That's part of my job. Okay, we have to know how many there are in case any go missing. - I could have told you how many. I know, I do the count. - Look, I know how nervous you get whenever Patrick starts sniffing around here. Believe me, his policies towards sustainable game farming are as abhorrent to me as they are to you. - What are you hiding? - I'm not hiding anything. - Tell me. - Look, nothing's been confirmed yet. - Tell me. - I'm not supposed to tell you this. - What? - Patrick's talking about culling. - What? - Paula, there's just too many of them. - I'm not interrupting anything, am I? - No, no, come sit down. (tense rhythmic music) (clattering) (door thuds) Well that's one way of tossin' a salad. - All she cares about are her elephants. (gentle instrumental music) - That's not true, Em. You see, your Aunt Paula didn't deal very well with the death of your parents. She just sort of threw herself into work without really giving herself a chance to grieve properly. And now I think things are just closing in on her. (gentle instrumental music) - I guess my being here just reminds her. - She loves you, you know that. (gentle instrumental music) It's okay. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic rhythmic music) (growling) (creaking) (growling) (thuds) (dramatic rhythmic music) - A message from our man in London. There's a Saudi businessman with a private game park and he's looking for a young elephant, birthday present for his daughter. He's having trouble finding a supplier. People don't like the way he treats his animals, but he's offering good money, very good money. Do I need to remind you, Ndhlovu, that you're an illegal immigrant here? One quick call, you could be on a train back home, and I'm sure the new government would be very interested in your wartime activities. Excellent. I'm glad we've had this chat. Now get me that elephant. - So, what are these things you're making? - Well, to tell you the truth, Em, I don't really know. I just sort of express how I'm feeling at the time that I'm carving 'em. What about you? What do you like to do? - Um, listen to music. Dance, I guess. Can't you stop them Uncle Joss? It'll break Paula's heart. - Yeah, I know. What can I do? You know, when we first came here, your Aunt Paula fell in love with this place. She found something here, something that made her feel like she belonged more than ever. - The elephants. - Yeah. You know, she really relied on your mother. They learned how to sign together. They understood each other. Paula's always had a hard time with other people. With the elephants she found a dignity, a grace. They shared something. Paula's a very graceful woman. - She is. Now that my mom's gone, I guess she's only got them. - Yeah. You know, I never realized how much she relied on the elephants till you came here. I guess I just was always too busy working. But now I either cull or I lose my job, this house. If I agree, well, we only lose some elephants, but if I refuse, in a way, we could lose them all. (sandpaper scratches) - Where does Aunt Paula go at night? - She has her secret place. She thinks I don't know. (chuckles) I got something for you. We don't have much call for dancing around here. - Thanks, Uncle Joss. - You're welcome. (elephant trumpets) (singing in foreign language) (tense rhythmic music) (rhythmic instrumental music) - [Emma] He remembers me. - Ah ah ah. (rhythmic instrumental music) (tense rhythmic music) - Best behavior, Ndhlovu, new clients this time. A whiz kid investment banker. They're very rich, stinking in fact. Randolph Hughes let me introduce you to Ndhlovu, my assistant. He's one of the best trackers in Africa. - Hello then. - Ndhlovu. It means Elephant Man. In the circumstances, perhaps appropriate. - Hello, I'm Susan, Susan Hughes. I'm very pleased to meet you. Elephant Man, you say? - Yeah, it's, uh, tribal stuff, some sort of ancestral connection. (slow tense music) - Is that right? Some sort of voodoo? How fascinating. - To find the elephants, you must make a sacrifice. (tense rhythmic music) I must have quiet. (tense rhythmic music) (rhythmic dance music) (thuds) (chuckles) - Do you think that's funny? - Well, yeah, it did have you falling about, you know? - Don't you have anything better to do all day other than sneaking up on young girls? - What could possibly be better than sneaking up on young girls? - Are all you country boys such losers? - I'm a chopper pilot. I fly helicopters. Look, Emma, if you trust me I can help you. - I don't care, I'm never getting in a helicopter. Now go away, I don't need your help. (thuds) (slow instrumental music) (tapping) - I think you do. (slow instrumental music) (speaking in foreign language) (insects chirp) (creaking) (bird squawks) (tense rhythmic music) (singing in foreign language) (elephant growls) (tense rhythmic music) (insects chirp) (elephant rumbles) (insects buzz) (slow tense music) (elephants rumbles) - Hmm? - Shh, shh. (elephant trumpets) (dramatic music) (yelling) (elephant trumpets) (dramatic instrumental music) (clattering) (elephant trumpets) (dramatic music) (clattering) - Somebody shoot the bloody thing! (tense rhythmic music) (elephant trumpets) (tense instrumental music) Shoot! (tense rhythmic music) Shoot! (tense rhythmic music) (creaking) (thuds) (bird squawks) Damn it, man, why didn't you shoot? (gentle instrumental music) (rumbling) (helicopter whirs) (elephant trumpets) (gentle instrumental music) (birds chirp) (speaks in foreign language) (dramatic rhythmic music) (rumbling) (dramatic rhythmic music) - What do the ancestors say, Ndhlovu? (dramatic rhythmic music) (bird chirps) - Uncle Joss told me about this place. How Oleander died here seven years ago. He said that they can still feel her spirit here. It's like they're keeping in touch. (gentle instrumental music) My father came here? (gentle instrumental music) I know. I miss them, too. (gentle instrumental music) (keyboard keys click) (beeping) (dramatic instrumental music) - Morena Game Park is planning an elephant cull within the next few days. (tense instrumental music) (phone rings) Yeah? - [Russell] Joss, an elephant's attacked Ripshaw's camp. - When? - [Russell] The early hours of this morning. - Okay, I'm on my way. - [Russell] See you there. (speaking in foreign language) - It's Askari. I recognize the tracks. (soft chattering) (dramatic rhythmic music) - I hope I'm gonna be compensated for this. You're bloody lucky nobody got killed here last night. That elephant is one mean, nasty specimen. He's out of control. He needs taking out. - That elephant has nothing to do with you. He's my problem and I'll sort it. - I can save you the trouble. - Yeah, like you did with my rhino? - I don't know what you mean. - You disgust me. You lay off of my animals. - Once they're this side of the fence, they're no longer your animals, Joss. They're anybody's. Believe me, we won't rest until that elephant is dead. (tense instrumental music) - You, you surprise me. Abusing your gift. You're a disgrace to your name. - Anyway, what's wrong with me knocking over the odd tusker from time to time, ah? You're gonna be doing it yourself pretty soon. (tense instrumental music) You're no different to me, McKinley. Maybe we should become partners. Maybe your wife could put in a good word for us with the elephants. (chuckles) - I'm nothing like you, Ripshaw. I don't kill for gain or for sport. But if I catch you on my side of the fence, I might just kill for fun. (tense rhythmic music) - If you had any sense, you'd do what I do. Call in the billionaire industries or corporate maharajas, maybe even the odd crowned head. Any fool with money will do, really. Charge 'em a fortune, jolly weeks of acting as the big white hunter for a day. You'd make a fortune. Yeah, it'd help you fix all those holes in your fence. (chuckles) - I don't appreciate being treated like a fool, Mr. Ripshaw. (rhythmic instrumental music) (singing in foreign language) - That young elephant you saw, how old do you think? - Eight, maybe nine. (rustling) (slow instrumental music) (speaks foreign language) (tense instrumental music) - What is it? (speaks foreign language) (tense instrumental music) - Is that him? - That's your elephant. (tense instrumental music) - With our herd currently growing by 7% annually, we cannot hope to sustain the two square kilometers each elephant needs. We are currently able to sustain 1.6 square kilometers per elephant, and falling. The effect on our habitat is devastating. We have a 25% excess on our hands, and we'll only be able to relocate five to 8% at most. So, gentlemen, the figures speak for themselves. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - You have put forward a very compelling argument, Patrick, and backed it with impressive evidence. The mere fact that all three of you came here today to present your case is in itself an indication of how seriously you view the situation at Morena and how anxious you are to do something about it. It's an issue with, as you know, far reaching political ramifications. But if this is the right thing to do, then we should do it. - Look, I, I don't understand why we can't buy more land. I mean, where have our profits gone? - Joss, I have already demonstrated to the board there is no profit margin. Costs are going up. - Joss, if we do decide to go ahead with this proposed course of action, and bearing in mind your standing in international wildlife conservation circles, well, to quote President Lyndon Johnson, "I'd rather have you inside the tent peering out "than outside peering in." (laughing) (tense instrumental music) (insects buzz) (speaks foreign language) - I get the impression this elephant's a lot smarter than they are. - We think he can't be too far up ahead. - Yes, well, you keep saying that. - As long as we stay downwind, we'll be all right. Are you ready? - Down what wind? - You've lost him. - No, not really. He just seems to have vanished into thin air. - Now we're about a mile away from the boundary of the Morena Game Park. If he's kept heading in that direction, he'll have crossed it. - Is that where he came from, the game park? - Elephants are constantly on the move. - Why the hell didn't you tell us this in the first place? - Well you wanted to shoot an elephant. - Yes, but not a game park elephant. Surely that can't be legal. - We were under the impression that this was a proper hunting concession, all above board. - I do have a concession and it's perfectly legal. That is a wild roaming elephant. He's fair game. - Listen, Ripshaw, as far as I'm concerned you brought us out here on false pretenses. I don't want you to say any more about it. You'll be hearing from my lawyer. - Yes, if you don't mind I'd like to get back to the camp, please. (dramatic instrumental music) (phone rings) - Patrick. Oh, yes, tomorrow. So, I'll deliver him to you the day after. Okay, bye bye. Hey, Russell. How are you? - I know what's going on, Patrick, and I think it stinks. - It's not easy for any of us, Russell, but we all have a job to do. - No, I don't think you understand. I know what's really going on. You should tell your partners to be careful what paperwork they leave lying around. - I don't know what you think you know, Russell. Shut up and listen. But I think it would be in your interest not to mention it to anyone. It's not good to tell tales, Russell, is it? Just imagine if someone were to find out you're a farm boy pilot without a license. - I don't have to be a part of this. - Oh, but you do. You see, you work here, which means you do what I tell you, because if you don't I would have to send you back to that hopeless little hole you crawled out of. And I wouldn't like to see a young life ruined for the sake of a few elephants. Do you hear me? Good, lad. (engine rumbles) (birds chirp) (parrot squawks) - They're gonna do it. - It's a crazy world. Paula. Paula, in some places elephants are in danger of extinction, but here we protect them and their families get bigger and bigger. - Oh, please! - There's no other way, we have to cull. And I still am against culling, but we have no other alternative, Paula. Askari broke out and went on a rampage on Savuti Flat. You should see the damage. - How many? - We can't continue like this, Paula. We must reduce the elephant population. - But aren't there other more humane methods? I mean, isn't there any other way? - Look, this operation has been given top level approval. We have a job to do now. - Oh, damn it, Joss! How many? - 300. (somber instrumental music) Look, this is crazy, Paula. We're on the same team. - When? - I can't tell you that. Paula. Paula! Paula. (door slams) - Do you know which ones? - We haven't decided yet. - Uncle Joss, please, don't take Paula's family from her. (somber instrumental music) (door thuds) (soft chattering in foreign language) - All is not lost, Ndhlovu. You think you could still find that young elephant? - If you want me to, yes. - Good. We'll go in at sundown. We'll cross just below Manana Pools. There's that old gate there, they don't use anymore. Find out if they're still in the area. Take the radio with you. If they're still there, I need to know their exact location. We do this thing properly, we could be in and out of there in a couple of hours, and those game rangers won't know the difference. (dramatic instrumental music) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) (elephant roars) - It's like they know what's coming. (elephants roar) - I hope not. (gentle instrumental music) - Aunt Paula, have you seen Ollie? (gentle rhythmic music) He's not here. We have to look for him. - Tomorrow. - Do you promise? - I promise. (elephant trumpets) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) (tense instrumental music) (helicopter whirs) - [Man] All personnel leaving in 10 minutes. (dramatic instrumental music) All personnel leaving in 10 minutes. Report to the observational deck. - We've been monitoring their movements and have a relatively good idea about where they are. But, gentlemen, we must track fast. We know there was a large herd around here last night, but they could be anywhere within this radius now. There's another group up here just north of Mobedi Bush Camp. Elmon, that will be your region. It's nearly 50Ks from here. Let's go, gentlemen. (soft chattering) (dramatic instrumental music) (helicopter whirs) (tense dramatic music) Joss, I think we've gotta look at an alternative to H Group. We'll never get the trucks through the riverbed. The only other group in the area is the. (tense dramatic music) - Paula, we have strike. - Paula, I made the decision. Look, I know how you feel about these animals. - Don't patronize me, Patrick. - Paula has alerted the media. - Paula this exercise is abhorrent to us as-- - Oh, bullshit! Save it. (dramatic tense music) - Your wife had better learn to control her mouth for your sake. (dramatic tense music) - Aunt Paula, Aunt Paula! Thank goodness I found you. - Not now, later. - But you promised to look for Ollie! - Later! (dramatic tense music) Get in. (tense instrumental music) - [Ripshaw] How much longer are you gonna be? - Won't be long, boss. - [Ripshaw] Get a move on! - Yeah, boss. (speaking in foreign language) (elephant trumpets) (growling) (helicopter whirs) (dramatic rhythmic music) (helicopter whirs) (dramatic rhythmic music) (elephants trumpet) - Victor Bravo here, I think we found them. Smallish herd, maybe eight, just below the escarpment. - That's them. - Yeah. (dramatic instrumental music) (elephants trumpet) (helicopter whirs) (dramatic instrumental music) - Victor Bravo to base, we are unable to get a clear sight on our target. It's over to you guys now. (elephants trumpet) - And we copy that, Victor Bravo. Ground unit's on its way. (dramatic rhythmic music) - Base, this is Victor Bravo, we have the ground unit in sight and, uh, we're moving out. - Roger that, Victor Bravo. Proceed to next target at Lower Zabi. - Lower Zabi, isn't that where the O family is? (dramatic rhythmic music) (gentle instrumental music) (engine rumbles) (speaking in foreign language) - Come on, guys, this way. Okay, guys, let's get this over with. - I've got this cousin who's always bragging about how many animals he's shot, impala, wildebeests, zebra, springbok. Today when I get home, I'm gonna phone him up and say, hey, Trevor, guess what? Today I just shot 30 elephants, like sitting ducks in a fairground. - Oh, yeah? Even a lousy marksman like you can't miss on this on this type of shoot. (chuckles) - Give me that gun. - Sorry? - Give me that gun. You, too. Now get the hell out of here. All of you. - But, Joss, what about the operation? - [Joss] Forget about it. (helicopter whirs) (dramatic music) - There they are. (helicopter whirs) (dramatic music) - Go, time to go, run! Please! - Go! - Why won't you run? Go, move! (elephant trumpets) - Run! - [Emma] Run, go! - Go, damn it, run! (helicopter whirs) (yelling) (helicopter whirs) (elephants trumpet) - Go away! (dramatic music) Stop! - Move! Get out of the way! Get out! (dramatic instrumental music) - [Emma] Go away! (elephants trumpet) (helicopter whirs) - Victor Bravo to base, we, uh, we have a problem. - Base to Victor Bravo, please elaborate. - Uh, we're gonna have to land. We've been trying to get a clear shot, but Dr. McKinley and her niece are standing in the way. There's nothing I can do. - Damn it, farm boy. Get those women out of there. Firing a warning shot. Show them that you're not playing around. I don't care if they're in the way. They shouldn't be there. - Sir, I cannot shoot. (elephants trumpet) The elephants might stampede, and this is just way too dangerous. - You will do what I tell you. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Hello? (static hums) Damn it, farm boy. Base to Joss McKinley. (singing in foreign language) (rhythmic music) (cheering) Base to Joss McKinley. Joss, come in. Joss, come in. - Go for Joss. - Damn it, Joss, I warned you about this. What the hell is going on? - Patrick, I've called off the whole operation. Cancel everything, I can't go through with it. - You did what? Joss, are you crazy? You have no authority to make that decision. Go back to Lower Zabi and get us back on track! That's an order, Joss! Damn it! (engine sputters and rumbles) (dramatic rhythmic music) (engine rumbles) (dramatic rhythmic music) - No. - You have to trust me, angel. It's all over, the operation's been called off. (tense rhythmic music) - Really? (dramatic rhythmic music) - [Russell] Where do you think you're going? - Russell, it's Ollie, he's gone missing. I need to find him. - [Russell] Damn. - What, what, what is it? - Ollie, Ripshaw was looking for a young elephant. - Ripshaw the poacher? Please, Russell, I need your help. - Come with me. (dramatic rhythmic music) Come on. They've already got a head start. - I can't, I can't. - It's the only way we're gonna find him. You'll be safe with me, I promise. Come on. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic instrumental music) (helicopter whirs) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) - If you think I'm gonna help you get your little party swinging again, Khumalo, you can think again. There. (elephant trumpets) (brakes squeal) Don't. That is him. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get me a big elephant. (truck rumbles) (helicopter whirs) (soft chattering) (slow tense music) (guns click) (slow tense music) Enough! (birds chirp) (helicopter whirs) (elephant trumpets) - Russell, look, it's Ollie. (elephant trumpets) (helicopter whirs) (gun fires) (beeping) - We've been hit. Hang on! (helicopter rumbles) (chuckles) (yelling) (beeping) Mayday, mayday! We've been hit by gunfire. We need to execute an emergency landing. - It's Emma and Russell, they're in trouble. (dramatic instrumental music) - We're gonna land! (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) - Look, it's Askari. If we land, he'll crush us. - If we don't get him to calm first. (elephant trumpets) (dramatic instrumental music) (helicopter rumbles) (dramatic music) (yelling) - No, Ripshaw, it's enough! - Stand back, Ndhlovu. There's plenty other trackers in Africa. (dramatic music) (elephant growls) (dramatic instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) (yelling) (helicopter rumbles) (dramatic tense music) (gun fires) (elephant trumpets) (helicopter whirs) (beeping) (helicopter whirs) (elephant rumbles) (gentle rhythmic music) (elephant roars) - It's over. - Thank you, sir. You saved us. - I was trying to save the young one. (exciting rhythmic music) (dramatic music) - Help me up, damn you. (clanking) (tense rhythmic music) (exciting rhythmic music) - Thank God! Emma! - I wouldn't worry about her. She's a pretty touch cookie. - Go radio an ambulance. - Who would've thought after all these years of hunting I'd be shot by my own bloody tracker? - It was an accident, Uncle Joss. Ripshaw kept firing at us, but Ndhlovu knocked him down. (slow tense music) (soft chattering) (elephant trumpets) (gentle music) He's okay. (gentle rhythmic music) (elephants trumpet) You stopped them. (engines rumble) - Not yet. - Get these vultures out of here. McKinley, what the hell is going on here? Why did you stop the damn cull? - You gave the order? - No, I'm the one who gives the orders around here. Get that chopper back to Lower Zabi. - Enough is enough, Patrick. - If you don't get this show back on the road, I'll make sure you go to jail for this, McKinley. - I think that's you who's going to jail, Patrick. Why don't you tell them about the deal you made with Ripshaw? - What deal? Remember what I told you, farm boy? Don't be foolish now. - You made a deal to supply ivory at a very good price. - The sun's gone to your head. You are jabbering. Just switch this thing off! - Patrick, it's got your signature on it. (tense instrumental music) - It's a forgery! Ripshaw must be using my name to get access to the ivory. - I'm not taking the rap for this on my own, Khumalo. - You're finished, Patrick! Poaching carries a very heavy penalty. - You're not going to believe him, are you? You think I would also sink myself with someone who's no more than a common thief? - You do yourself an injustice, Khumalo. Why don't you tell Joss where all your profits went? - Guess you were right, Patrick. It is a shame to waste a life just for the sake of a few elephants. - You can't take me down, McKinley. I've got influential friends, I know people! (tense instrumental music) Let's go, Alex. (dramatic instrumental music) - Let him go, Russell, let him go. He's not gonna get far here. (dramatic instrumental music) (soft chattering) (dramatic music) We'll let the police deal with him. (engines rumble) I'm so sorry, angel. I guess there's more to it than just counting. (exciting rhythmic music) - What now? - I don't know, but we'll think of something.
