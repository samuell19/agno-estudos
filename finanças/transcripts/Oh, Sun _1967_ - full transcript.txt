OH, SUN Written and Directed by MED HONDO It's us, the Africans, come from afar. We had our own civilization. We forged iron. We had our popular dances and songs. We were very good at sculpting wood and working iron, spinning cotton and wool, weaving and basketwork. Our commerce wasn't just barter. We made gold and silver coins. We had pottery and cutlery. We made our own tools and domestic utensils, using brass, bronze, ivory, quartz and granite. We had our own literature. We had our legal terminology, our religion, our science, and our teaching methods. Father, forgive me for speaking Fulani. Father, forgive me for speaking Bambara. Father, forgive me for speaking Creole. Father, forgive me for speaking Laari. Father, forgive me for speaking Bamoun. Father, forgive me for speaking Kikongo. - Forgive me for speaking Swahili. - Father, forgive me for speaking Lingala. Father, forgive me for speaking Kisangani. Father, forgive me for speaking Sumbe. To live with Christ is to love God and men, and to fight against the fiend. Satan, leave these children, and may the spirit of Christ enter into them. There is the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God. As salt gives flavor to food, Christ, if we believe in him, brings meaning to our lives. Receive the salt of wisdom. May he purify you and help you enter the kingdom of God. To be baptized is to become part of the church and share the Christian faith. By entering God's church, you will, like Christ, have eternal life. You promise to renounce Satan, to fight sin, and to resist temptation. I bless you in the name of Christ our savior, and for eternal life. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Jean, go in peace. The Lord is with you. Jean.

One day, I started studying your writing, reading your thoughts, talking Shakespeare and Moliere, and holding forth. Sweet France... I am bleached by your culture, but I remain a Negro, as I was at the beginning. I bring you greetings from Africa. I am glad to walk upon your soil and to discover your first city, which is also my capital. Sweet France... I am coming to you. I am coming home. You poor thing. Marseilles... You know...

I'm looking for work, that's all. - I didn't know that was illegal. - This isn't a souk. This is a private company, you can't just walk in. But that man over there let me in. Madou, did you let him in? Yes, sir. Don't give him a hard time. He's only looking for work. You can't let just anyone in. This is a private company. VACATION IN BLACK AFRICA Excuse me. Thank you. What is it? What do you want? It's about the accountant job in the paper. Oh, yes. Yes. Pass me a number 14 wrench. Okay, okay. No. Is the job taken? No. - Where's that wrench? - It's coming! No. I mean... It's not taken. No. No. I know that discrimination isn't common here. Am I not in the land of the free? I'm as much at home here as anywhere. We are equal, you and me. We had the same ancestors. They were all Gauls. No, no. Run, run, comrade, the old world is behind us. Run, run, comrade, the old world is behind you! Is anyone in? Excuse me, sir. I... I need your help. - Who'll pay the car installments? - Oh, shut up! You didn't have to buy a sports car. I never buy anything! Why shouldn't I? I've had it up to here. It's always you. I work, too! - And I don't? - I work as much as you do! You make me sick! If this goes on, I'm leaving. I've had enough. - I pay for everything here! - And I can't do anything. - What do you mean? - I can't even hear my program. - Me neither! - Yours are stupid! Are yours any better? Mass! - Shut up, idiot! - Shit! And so he went with them to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus picked up some bread. Having said the blessing, he broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body." Then he took a cup. Having given thanks, he gave it to them and said, "Drink, all of you, for this is my blood, and that of the covenant that will be spilt for the many, for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I shall not drink this fruit of the vine, until I drink new wine with you in the kingdom of my father." Having sung the psalms, they left for the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, "This night all of you will have your faith shaken because of me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the flock will be dispersed. So the employment service sent you? Sit down. Thank you. With all your years of experience, I'd like to know what conclusions you have drawn on the profitability and the value of tests concerning African labor. Well, it's a considerable undertaking, but not one that incurs great expense. In truth, it involves no investment whatsoever. The only expenditure is in the transfer of materials. Or rather, personnel. In my view, it's the most profitable method. At least, I know of no company, that after having tried this method hasn't continued using it. And what was behind your thinking in developing this procedure? It is absolutely indispensable to choose individuals who are capable of understanding things like we do, of thinking like we do, of remembering, of... retaining. Yes, capable of retaining words as we do, and above all, of giving them the same meaning. In this way, there will soon be millions of white Negroes. White and economically enslaved. Slaves, only civilized. Yes. It may not be the best meaning, but at least it's ours, and the only one compatible with our technical world. Today, the aim of our lesson is to help you understand the meaning of words. One may believe he has been understood, without that being the case. For example, some of you here are less gifted than others. As soon as someone asks you to go and get some part or some object, you rush off, appearing to have understood, but return with something completely different. So, pay attention and listen closely. Repeat after me. Here. A hacksaw. A hacksaw. A handsaw. A handsaw. A screwdriver. A screwdriver. A crescent wrench. Flat-nose pliers. An alligator clip. A crescent wrench. - A broom. - A broom. Do you think it desirable for European companies, and also for migrant labor, that this selection process be extended to all Africans who want to come to Europe? Insofar as we do not wish to see Africans... as potential vagabonds... At 10 Rue Roque de Fillol, a man rented a flat that was in a very bad state, but which had seven rooms, a kitchen and a toilet. He decided to install 51 beds, that he sublet to African workers. Soon, 80 people were living there. Each one paid 23,000 old francs in key money, plus a monthly rent of 3,500 francs. The tenant therefore made a profit of over three million francs a year. When the flat became uninhabitable, the workers were taken in by a shelter in the 20th arrondissement. To wait for something better. Insofar as anyone believes that they can and should be employed by our companies, I think a selection procedure should be carried out before they leave Africa. That would indicate to us their potential for development. STOP THE NEGRO-ARAB MENACE Tell me what you think. No one's interested. The French aren't interested. What about those already living in Europe? The same principle applies. For example, when one recruits individuals at random, a lot of energy is wasted. Therefore, it is very desirable, and in the best interests of those workers living amongst us, to activate a selection process allowing us to choose those who are the most useful in terms of skilled jobs. The correct choice can only be made through a selection process. For this selection process to take place, people must be present. It is therefore inadvisable to restrict their departure. In your view, should Africans be allowed to come to France and Europe? Or should they be prevented from coming? Individuals will always have the desire, whatever they are and wherever they live, to go elsewhere to try their luck. Furthermore, on a practical level, I don't really see how we could stop them. But let's not forget that faced with this wave of migration, Europe's interests are being served. It is a continent in constant evolution towards a kind of bourgeois state, with the help of some elements... of the working class... in which the most onerous and banal jobs, we might say, are gradually being relinquished by native citizens. Therefore, others must take their place. After midnight, the demonstration moved towards the town center. By daybreak, calm had returned... Please, sit down. Fifteen people have been injured in the demonstrations. Students and workers from Gothenburg in Sweden have formed a solidarity committee with workers, teachers, students and artists on strike in France. The committee has asked me to contact the French strikers and give them a sum of money collected by the workers of Gothenburg. You know, according to our union rules, this strike is a national matter and it does not concern other countries. Our workers want for nothing, especially money. The union has made sure they can survive for another month. In my view, and contrary to what you think, this strike is not just about France, it concerns all countries. The financial solidarity of foreign workers is an important step towards revolutionary political solidarity. If I may say so, that is a romantic idea, peddled by irresponsible elements who have infiltrated us and who are trying to divide the working class by proclaiming utopian and ill-thought-out slogans. Believe me, we know that this strike is not a revolutionary one. Our demands are all that matter. The working class is sophisticated enough to understand that this strike is the result of patient organization by our activists over many years. Fine. What about the immigrant workers? Of course, the foreign worker situation is more difficult. But we can't contact them. They're not at work. Still, you could take the money and give it to them later. We have no special account for them. The only difference, in my view, is that their place should be taken by migrants from countries closer to us than Africa, who are naturally more adaptable than Africans. These workers are European, and they ask to come here. In this way, we would avoid having to confront the human, social, and political problems that will surely arise from the mass immigration of African workers, who risk becoming a sub-proletariat group. "Black invasion". The expression has been used and must be refuted. It's true that at the time, it related to the apparent tide of students and trainees from all over Africa who came to France to study or to learn, a new way of living. Some men went Apollo, to the Moon to look for summer Apollo, they challenged the cosmos Apollo, they sang without echo Apollo, leaving the Earth and its misery I don't know why Apollo, they went round in circles Apollo, did they want to discover Apollo, diamonds or sapphires? Apollo, leaving the Earth and its misery Love is there, open-armed Why leave if you can't cure it?

Towards the immensity that dazzles us Day and night We are all crazy We are all crazy We are all crazy Oh, yes, my brother. Yes. But in Tanganyika, in Rhodesia, in South Africa... Africa, Africa. Oh, yes, my brother. Yes. What is it? What is it? Who do you want? Where are you going? Hello, madam, it's about the accountant job. - In the paper. - We don't have an accountant. - But it's in today's paper. - They're not here. Please, I'd like you to leave. There are enough of you here already. Why don't you go home? Excuse me, madam, can you tell me where I'm from? - Please. - Stay right where you are! - Get lost! - What are you doing here? Go on, get lost! Hello. I'd like to talk to you about... It's an important matter. I assure you... Yes. Listen to me. You know... It's quite a big deal. - Yes. Why not? - Okay, I'll talk to the president. The check. Oh, shit! That's crazy! TAX-FREE SAVINGS ACCOUNT 37 francs 33. We are from the Republic of Tabaria. We are a new country, a poor and wretched one with no natural resources. We are under-underdeveloped. But we have several... several embassies in the world. - Hello. - Hello, my brother. All right? Hello. Hello. Come in. Sit down, everyone. Find a place. Do the best you can. Right, I think everyone's here, so I will tell you the result of our petition to the ministry. This is what they have agreed upon. A solution has been found... What did they say? Specialist associations will find us old buildings, which can be made liveable again. These old buildings... are bought and then renovated. The habitable area is divided into small dormitories of about four square meters. - For six to eight people. - Rabbit hutches, you mean! Comrade, I think we have a lot of difficulties surviving in this country. That's why we must now think about the problem of returning to our native countries. - To our native forests! - Exactly! That is the question, in fact. If they don't need us, then why invite us here? That is the question. We're better off at home. So why are we here? Forty people to a room is unbelievable. Enough words. We need action. - We all agreed on that. - But what kind of action? They are hypocrites. - We must speak out. - Profiteers. We're wasting our time, freezing. We don't even have homes. Incredible. Slaves forever. Unimaginable. You can't take people for idiots. Who brought us here? They did! We've been looking for six months. Nothing. Nothing at all. Now, three of our comrades are hospitalized because they've caught tuberculosis. Why? Because they live in terrible conditions in basements. This situation is due, it must be said, to the lack of will on behalf of many councils who fear public reaction to what they call "the influx of foreign workers." - They were the ones who colonized us! - You said it! Don't worry, we'll colonize them back. Look, let's not get angry. We have more important things to discuss. So, if you don't mind, let's move on. I think we need to think more seriously about returning home. Otherwise they'll put brooms in our hands and say, "Go on, sweep the whole of France." That's why we have to contact our respective embassies in order to return home. The ambassador doesn't represent the ones working in Paris. He represents France in Dakar. I know the embassy is in on it! That idiot of an ambassador... I think the ambassador should at least say to us, "Don't go to France, because they'll exploit you." - You're kidding! - Obviously! But all we can do is appeal to the relevant government department. Either that, or to the embassies of our respective countries. But the ambassador defends the government's interests. Absolutely. He represents Dakar in France, and France in Dakar. It's always about France! That's why I hate hawkers of Negro poetry who boast about being black. They're only looking after their own interests. They're traitors. - So, is France our country? - Yes, since our presidents all fail. - So independence doesn't exist? - Absolutely not. - That's rubbish! - It's obvious! "Black invasion." The phrase was spoken without spite, but with a hint of uneasiness, perhaps. It was aimed at the "new colored" who strolled along the Boul'Mich', or hung around boulevard Saint-Germain. There were several dozen of them in 1946, several hundred in 1948, over 15,000 in 1964 and 300,000 in 1967. How many are there now? How many will there be tomorrow? Beyond a certain level, a previously harmless phenomenon became more significant for some. "Black invasion." The words are loaded with dynamite. There are more and more of them. What are they doing here? They wanted independence and got it. Now they can stay at home. They get money, too. We support them. Do you realize that? You can't push your luck too far. Okay, they come here to do the jobs that we don't want to do. But they should invent machines to do them! It's simple, isn't it? Instead, look. Great, isn't it? We former, present and future colonized people have contributed greatly to the foundation of your industrial and economic capital. Should the interest on that capital not be our right? So please don't say that we're costing you dearly. Furthermore, the help you are giving to us is aimed above all at preserving your own markets and maintaining your economic privileges. - Got a light, please? - Yes, I do. Thanks. Let's see. I've got one, two, three, four, five. Two of them are teachers. They're nice. They're educated and polite, so I've got no complaints. - I've got a lot more. - Really? On the first floor, I've got two. On the second, two. On the fourth, I've got three. And eight on the sixth! Good evening! Hello. - Hello. - Hello, ladies. Good evening. It's okay. I've got my ID card and work permit. Can I come in now? I won't be thrown out, will I? - Go on. - Go on in, right at the end. You know, all my former tenants have left. Of course. People are more free at home. BLACK INVASION 500,000 WORKERS A YEAR! Yes. In short, the majority of the people want African workers to fulfill certain tasks, but only on the condition that they don't show themselves much and live elsewhere. Underground, for example. Why not? It is true that the current European policy regarding African immigration, especially that concerning overseas territories, will have serious consequences. It is storing up trouble for the future. Racial conflict, suffering, hate, despair. These ills will strike both communities, but especially the black community: the victim of being a minority. Absolutely not. My daughter is free. She does what she wants. I have nothing against anyone. But we must recognize that we're not all the same. For example, Africans eat millet... and we eat potatoes. We eat potatoes, too. You mean the ones who are already here? Well, of course. There are more and more of them. If it continues, we'll have to herd them like... the American Indians. Oh, goodness! I've been promising them I'd go for six months. - Don't exaggerate. - Apparently he's very cute. Will you hurry up? I'm coming. - Hello. - Hello. - It's been ages. - How are you? - We came to see the baby. - That's nice. Where is he? Right there behind you. All right. Come on, darling. Come and say hello to Grandad. Say hello to Grandad. See, that's Grandad. And that's our cousin. Come on, say hello. Come now. Here you are. This is for the baby. We were just passing by. We have to rush off. - Goodbye. Keep in touch. - Goodbye. See you soon. It's all right, darling. It's over. It's incredible. How strange. I've never seen that before. - Do you want a drink? - Yes, I'd love one. Have you ever slept with a black man? - Are you mad? - Thanks a lot. You're crazy! Wouldn't you like to try? One day? Out of curiosity. I would. He'd have to be handsome. Have you? Not yet. But I'd like to try. You know, I've heard... And I've heard that... - No! - Yes, really! That's not true! Some of them have big mouths, like this. "Open your big mouth!" That's so funny! - So, shall we try it? - Yes! All in all, man's great misfortune is his lack of faith and affection for his fellow man. We are all wrapped up in ourselves, admit it. Indeed. It's what everyone says. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Still, it's crazy. I can't understand it. - Really, I can't. - What? - That girl we just passed. - Well? What about her? - Didn't you notice anything? - No. Didn't you see she was arm in arm with a black man? Oh, yes. Is that all you can say? Whenever I see something like that, it bothers me, I can't help it. I've got nothing against them. And the proof is the fact that I love Negro spirituals. Pardon me, but I'm a Negro. You? You're joking, aren't you? So, did you sleep well? I heard that Africans in bed were... But... BIAFRAI THE END THE RIGHT IS UNSYMPATHETIC THE LEFT IS HARDLY REVOLUTIONARY I AM SICK OF THE WHITE RACE Hey, you blacks! Cut it out with your crap, you idiots! Look, my skin is whiter than yours! Dirty Negro, get lost! - Shit! - Pardon me. Look! Did you see that, madam? All these Arabs, they're all the same! One's just as bad as the other! What are you standing there for? Get lost! Go on! Order is chaos. That's clear. White people have always organized civilization with order. I mean, their civilization, for their profit. For whites, there are three kinds of living beings: human beings, animals, and then the Negro. In any case, what's for sure is that in their eyes, we've never quite been men. If I were a Negro, I would hate the white race. The cause of all our troubles. Yes. It's true. To your health. I'm telling you, in 100 years, all our grandchildren will be Negroes. Maybe sooner. Do you realize that Africa will rule over France? What do you expect? That's the future. Shit! Here's another one. Can I sing here? Yes, but softly. - Eh? - Softly. - For me, singing is singing! - Yes, okay. Sing softly, because the clients clap and the patrol car arrives. You have to explain everything. They're like children. Come and sit with your brothers. - There. - Thanks. Jordi! My God, what a white man's life, eh? My God. God is surely white. Unless he's a Negro. Well, if he's a Negro, he's the biggest bastard the world ever invented! - To his health! - Good health! What's on the tape recorder? Well, there's a very big surprise for you. It's an old African song. Did you see the three savages Who all turned up in Paris? They were as black as soot From their heads to their belly buttons They seek their fortune All around the Chat Nair By the light of the moon In Montmartre, at night Did you see the three savages Who all turned up in Paris? They were as black as soot From their heads to their belly buttons They seek their fortune All around the Chat Nair By the light of the moon In Montmartre, at night Did you see the three savages... They're nice people. It's the truth, and that's a fact. To the health of your Negro grandchildren. ...in Paris They were as black as soot ...to their belly buttons They seek their fortune All around the Chat Nair By the light of the moon In Montmartre, at night Did you see the three savages Who all turned up in Paris? They were as black as soot From their heads to their belly buttons They seek their fortune All around the Chat Nair By the light of the moon In Montmartre, at night It's true that if we don't force them to accept our way of seeing things, there's a good chance they'll carry on in their own way. It's also true that, not having their consent, we have no reason to be interested in their personal tastes. We are there to impose what amounts to our happiness, which should then become theirs. Love our uniforms, our Jesus, our culture, our manufactured products. Help us to maintain order in your country, and you will become possessed possessors. You will be rich. You will have millions of cars, refrigerators, radios, luxury soaps, mini-skirts, maxi-skirts and short socks. You will have tons of gold and diamonds, which we will have taken the precaution of extracting from your country. In short, you will be that which we have always wanted you to be: over-civilized, over-developed, over-abandoned. Thus, you will have acquired happiness and eternal joy. Yes, happiness. Happiness. If we raise them, bit by bit, to the dignity of an electorate, it is clear that whoever they elect will never have a mandate to work towards the realization of their goals. This last condition is imperative and essential. Without it, where would we be? It's the latest coup d'etat. He has replaced General Gulawa. - Mr. President! - Quiet, please. Mr. President, how did your meeting with our president go? It went very well. There were no problems. Everything went very well. On what policies will you base your new government? First of all, we started by meeting with the politicians... in order to allow us to better organize our power... to give new laws to our nation... and new democratic structures. This plan will be submitted to your government, to your president. AFRICAN CULTURE TOWARDS THE WEST THE EXPORTATION OF WESTERN CULTURE Come on. You are branded by Western civilization. You think "White." Go and work elsewhere. When I earn deutsche marks, I deposit them in Switzerland. Enter into my heart. Give me eternal life. Because money is freedom! Everything's burnt! Nothing's left! You have a glass of champagne in your hand. You have every right to throw it in my face. You are complicit in all the crimes on Earth. You allow the continuation of slavery, murder and genocide. You choose your victims and perpetrators by the color of their skin... according to whether they accept or refuse your policies. With a serene spirit, you sleep peacefully. A pleasant feeling of having a clear conscience envelops you. You become good Whites, good Blacks. All of you compassionate. All good Christians. But you know that all contact is out of self-interest. All dialogue is commerce. All aid is investment. All gifts are for future return. All truth can be bought. Man is dying before your open eyes, annihilated, scorned, rejected. Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa... Hello. How are you? It's nice in the countryside, isn't it? Run to the house. Come on. Come inside. Here we go. - He's eating a banana! - Don't eat bananas now. Julien, sit over here. Sit over there, this is my place. - I'm going to eat a banana. - No, start with the chicken. No, I'm starting with the salami. - I want salami. - Do you want some salami? Salami. - Do you want salami, Julien? - No! - Do you want chicken? - No. - Do you want salami? - No. - Do you want salami? - I said no! - Tomato? - No! Have some tomato, Julien. Have some tomato. - Do you want some tomato, Vincent? - No! Tomato? Serve yourself. There. I don't have a plate. Where's my plate? I've lost my plate. You've lost your plate? What have you done with it? These lunches just get better. My lovely chicken! - Have some ham. - Yes. Oh, the bananas! Oh! Oh, the bananas! Wait, look... Really! No. Right, can't you serve the tomatoes, too? Eh, Vincent? Crush the tomatoes. Feel free. Come away from there! Watch out for the bananas! The bananas! - Oh, the chicken! - The chicken! He's knocking everything onto the ground. What are your horrible brothers doing? Come on, children! He's going to knock over the table. Go on, Daddy. But... What's he doing? - Did you say something? - No. - Did he speak to you? - No. - What did I do? - Nothing. TO BE CONTINUED...
