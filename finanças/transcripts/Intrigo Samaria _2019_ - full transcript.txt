The people of the world are more or less the same. Though we may come in different shapes and colors, we all share the same inheritance. And we all have our back stories, and our secrets. Like this man, running along the river Scheldt in Antwerp. What is he running from? What is he trying to escape? Even though evolution might seem to mature us, there are still parts of our brain that belong to our reptile ancestors. Although we've convinced ourselves that hate, revenge, and nemesis belong to the past, our ancient ancestor's blood still runs in our veins, whether we like it or not. Feels like a bloody good campaign. As usual, you'd have to say. After holiday, we'll get started on images. I'll mail over a few suggestions for photographers. Excellent. Have a great holiday, and we'll be in touch. - Thank you, guys. Thank you. - Bye-bye. You're a genius Henry, you know that? Well, I don't know about that. Haven't we already discussed your raises? Five more days, guys, can't wait. - Until the holidays, you mean? - Yeah. John, we're waiting for you. Damn it. I love being at work. Come on. So what are your plans? For the holiday? We've rented a small house in Cote d'Azur. We're gonna head down there, do lots of long walks on the beach, piles of books, lots of good food, that sort of thing. - Sounds decent. - Well... In case you wondered, we'll be damp proofing the basement. Consider that when you complain about sand in your swimming trunks. - Hi, Henry. - Hey, Paula. - Yeah. - How are you? Paula... - Polans... Polanski. - Polanski. - Yeah, how are you? - I'm good. Wow. It's gotta be ten years since that... - Uh, almost exactly. Yeah. - Wow. Do you live, uh, here in Maardam? No, I live in Antwerp now. I'm just here on a couple of days work. Oh. - So, Film Academy? - Yeah. Mainly because I didn't know what else to do with myself, but, uh, I got in for whatever reason. Well, to make documentaries, which is what you're doing now, isn't it? I think I've seen one of them on ARTE. - Uh, Roman Beggars. - Roman, that's it. - Won an award. - Did it? - Yeah. - Good for you. That's great. - Thanks. Thanks. - Well done. I haven't actually been back to Kaalbringen since I've... Well, I stopped being a teacher. Wasn't really my thing. - So... - Yeah, I know. You work for one of those big, uh, advertising agencies. That's... that's right. How do you... The reunion. Oh, you're on the mailing list. Oh, right. The reunion. How was that? Almost everyone was there except you. Oh... All right, yeah. I don't know why that was. - I meant to come. - Yeah. Sure. Don't worry. You weren't the only teacher - that didn't show up. - Okay, cool. An actual fact, I was just a substitute teacher, not an actual teacher, so... - Yeah. - I don't... This is me. - Nice seeing you. - And you. I'm just staying at the Metropole, so... Okay. You live here in... in Maardam? Yeah, in Wassingen. It's a dreadful, dreadful place. But I probably have to win the Academy Award to get some advantage, though. - Anyway... - Well, listen, it's been nice seeing you. - Yeah, you, too. - Bye. Bye. Yeah, mainly because I didn't know what else to do with myself, but, uh, I got in for whatever reason. Well, to make documentaries, which is what you're doing now, isn't it? As far as I know, he's never had a visitor. You're the first. What's this for? It's a... it's a hard drive, just to store the footage. Oh, yeah. Hm... It's all beyond me, any who. If you ask me, Jacob Kall is a sick bastard. He's been in here ten years. He'll end his days in here. He'll never be released. It's a battery. All right. Yeah, I'll be outside that door. For your sake, just so you know. He sometimes gets it into this head to be violent. Yeah, yeah, I know. We never met, you and I, but I was in the same class as your daughter, Vera. You know, she never talked about you or her life on the farm in Samaria. Always cycled home when we went out drinking. We never really understood why. Well, she never talked about it, but, um, she was so... important to me. Well, not just to me, to all of us. We had a reunion a couple of weeks ago. Almost everyone was there. And it was really hard to avoid talking about her. Your daughter... your only daughter, even. Could you tell me a bit about your relationship with her? What was she like as a kid? Was she... happy? At the reunion, we talked a lot about how me missed having a grave to visit, and how you're probably the only person who knows where she's buried. That's if you even bothered to bury her? Only God knows where Vera is. Can I ask you what you believe? I believe in God and His will. Okay. I don't understand. Are you saying that Vera's death was God's will? Even though you never made a confession, and her body was never found, you were found guilty and banged up for life. Do you maintain your innocence? Do you also claim to be innocent of the accusations that you repeatedly mistreated her as a child? Injuries that were documented by the school nurse. The accident and emergency department at Kaalbringen. Although neither Vera nor your wife dared to speak out about it. Paula, I think you're looking for some sort of guilt. The guilt laid on my shoulders is of this world. But I'll tell you what, this world doesn't belong to me. What human being has the right to kill another person? We are all just simple instruments of a greater will. So you claim your innocence. So who did kill her? I sit here... most likely knocked up for the rest of my life. And it was probably meant to be. Sorry. It's meant to be. You see, I can get so much more work done in here. There are people in here who are willing to listen. So many lost souls finally have a safe haven. The question is rather if you, Paula Polanski, can understand this. I've been thinking about where you must have buried her. I know the police did some digging and searched with dogs. But down by the river, there's this little piece of land. And I'm thinking maybe that's where they should have looked? Or on the other side? In the forest? Yeah? I'm thinking she must have been heavy. Dead body weighs a ton. Maybe you used your tractor? Though you would've had to dug deep because you wouldn't want a fox to dig her up. I've never quite grasped why all you little people need to know everything. It's a human weakness to be obsessed with the truth. As if it were up to us. As if the truth even existed. Already done? Yeah. Didn't get very far. Right. Let's get going, Jacob. I'll just take him through the security gate. If you wait here, I'll see you out after that. Thanks. That question you never asked. No, I didn't kill Vera. Yeah, I've just finished. Just... just on my way to that meeting. Yeah, I know, I just wanna... I promise. Just... I hear you. I promise I will. I'll probably be on the 7:00 train anyways. No, don't be silly. I'll just get a taxi. All right. I love you. It was the first time we'd all been together since then. So... but it... It was like everyone needed to talk about Vera. Felt unfinished... somehow. I mean, really, we... Could have done with a grave visit. It was a strange time. It was... Life got too serious much too soon, it felt. More so for you than for me. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Uh, care for another? Um, yeah. Yeah, thanks. - Not for me. Thank you. - Oh. So... Hm? Apart from that, what's happening? Shacked up? Married? No. I'm living with someone. Clara, in Antwerp. She's... she's great. Ooh. Found these the other day. Oh, no. Ring any bells? Dear, oh, dear. Where have you got this? That's a long time ago. I remember that. Oh, this is the, uh, the graduation party at, uh, the, um... - Limburg Rooms. - The Limburg Rooms, that's right. Goodness me. You were walking around that night with your fantastic old camera, as always. Yeah. Nikon. - All right. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - I used to develop my own pictures as well. - Right. Was the worst kind of nerd, even then. Here you are. Schoolmaster Maertens. A tie? What on Earth was I thinking? Here's me with, um, with Sebastian. Oh, look at that. You haven't changed, have you? Oh, thanks. And here she is, Vera Kall. Oh. What was her father called? - Jacob. - Jacob. - He's locked up in Bittinger. - Yeah. Serving life sentence. Maintains his innocence. Actually, I met him yesterday. Met him? That Jacob Kall? Yeah. I... I interviewed him. I'm gonna make a film. Tell the story... story of Vera. I think she's worth that much. I'd really like you to be in it. - Henry... - I was a substitute teacher for one term, all right? I have to get my train. But you were an important person to all of us. And the film is not gonna be about you. I've already spoken to Beatrice Motte, I'm gonna speak to Commissioner Keller, and I'll speak to Jacob Kall again if I have to. Although, I'd... I'd... I'd rather not. A girl in your class was murdered. I'm really surprised you don't seem to care. I don't wanna be in your film. I'm sorry. What, because you think it's a bad idea? It will open up a lot of old wounds, and it will upset a lot of people. I do believe that. I think it's better to just let things lie. Okay. I know that. - Good. - But... I am gonna make this film. You'll have to do it without me. I'm sorry. Yes, I rented out the upper floor because it was rather difficult managing my own finances after my husband passed away. God bless him. He was useless in most ways, but there were certain things I'd still come to depend on him for. Sorry. Um... I'm gonna take this, actually. Sorry. - Hello. - Paula. Hi. It's... it's Henry Maertens. Am I calling at a bad time? No, no, no, no. Not at all. Great. I... I was thinking maybe I'll take a trip to Kaalbringen after all. - Yeah? - Yes, well, I was thinking about what you said. And, uh, maybe I could be of some help. Great. Is the Hotel Continental still there, do you know? Uh... uh, I think so, but, um, you could stay with me. I've, I've borrowed my parents' summerhouse by the river. No, no, I don't... I, um... There's plenty of space. And you can tell Clara that I'm gay, so... so no problem there. - Um... - Let's just leave it at that. Let me find The Continental, see if they have a room. Ah, okay, I'm just about to drive through a tunnel. Pau... Sorry. Okay. Uh, where were we? Um, were there lots of, uh, visitors or friends dropping in? Well, I don't know. I... I can't really remember. It was a long time ago. Wow. It's gotta be ten years since then. - Almost exactly. - An actual fact, I was just a substitute teacher, not an actual teacher. Yeah, I know. Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Kruggel. I'm Henry Maertens, the substitute teacher. Oh. I'm Susanne. Come in. Dad's waiting for you. Thanks. Can't imagine he'll ever improve. Always late. Always. Uh, Emil Bachmann. An idiot. Okay. Uh, Paula Polanski. She did very well in her, uh, in her standard test. - Paula Polanski? - I don't know, I... I haven't actually met any of the students yet. Ah, the mousey one. Yes. We're nearly finished. I promise. Um, Niels Buhltoft? Uh, neither fish nor fowl. Uh, unless he does something out of the ordinary in his special assignment on literature. Um, can I offer you a coffee or something? Um... no, do you know what? I think I'm good. - I think I should probably go. - Okay. Thanks so much for your help. I, uh, I have an appointment with the, uh, the headmaster in 20 minutes. So... - Hey. - Hi. - You all right? - Yeah, good. Welcome. Thank you. - Good to see you. - Yeah, yeah, you too. I... I was surprised when you called because when we met in Maardam, you sounded... - Yeah. - Very negative. Yeah, sorry, about that. Yeah, I managed to get a couple of days free. Clara's, uh, she'd step into work this week. She's a doctor, yup. Cardiologist. Did... did I tell you about Vera's mother? No. Well, she... she died a couple of months ago. Oh. When Vera's father was convicted, she left. She just walked out of that house, never went back. Moved in with her sister, apparently. Mm... - Samaria. - What? It's the name of the farm where Vera grew up. Ah, yeah. Sounds so beautiful. Samaria? Yeah. Yeah, I suppose it does. Like something out of a fairytale... almost. - A little like Vera herself. - Hm, yeah, maybe. Bit hungover today, guys? No pleasure without pain, isn't it? All right? You don't know what's happened, do you? What? Vera. Vera Kall. She never came home last night. - Oh. - Her mother report her missing to the police. Well, I'm sure she's fine. I'm sure she probably just stayed over with a friend or something. Okay? She'll be fine. - Hey. - Hey. Can I get a double espresso, please? Of course. Coming up. This is not only about Vera and her family, it is about all of us at City College. So I'd like to remind you that all information, anything you saw at the Limburg Rooms could be vitally important. You may think some item of information is of no use at all, but it could prove to be exactly that little missing piece of the puzzle, that will bring clarity to the circumstances surrounding Vera's disappearance. So don't hesitate. If for some reason you don't want to talk to the police directly, we are here. You can turn to any member of staff. Or to me, of course. Wow. It's great. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it? So I've, um, I've given you the room - that overlooks the river. - Okay. Sounds very flash. And I've, uh, I've moved myself into the box room. Ah. So how long can you stay? Couple of days, if not, more. Cool. How are you planning on making this film? Well, when you're making a documentary, you don't really know where it's gonna end, but I'm trying to meet everyone who knew her, interview them, and see if I can build up a picture of her. With all the plans to visit the grave, or whatever it is we're calling it? Yeah, that might have been part of my plan, but having met Jacob Kall, I'd say that's a little too much to hope for. Going for a new angle? Um, remains to be seen. You know, she... she clearly made an impression. Everybody has their own picture of Vera. I know I do, anyway. Maybe you do as well. Uh, yeah, as I recall her, she was a very good student. I want to understand, partially just who she was, but also what it does to us when someone just disappears out of our... You know, how we just carry on living as if nothing has happened. And is that what we really do? I suppose not. Do you want coffee? Please. Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks. At the same time, there is some strange stuff in this story. For instance, why did it take the police so long to arrest her father? And what was her mother's role in all of this? Is she completely exonerated? Or what if Jacob Kall is telling the truth and he's innocent? Are you serious? No, no, no, he's a monster, I mean, you just have to keep the door open - when it's a work in progress. - Of course. I'm guessing you know how to do that. I hope so. It was just like in that film with, um, Bill Murray. What's it called? Uh, Groundhog Day. I rented a room from an old widow, uh, Mrs. Kuntze. Same routine, every morning. It was me and this guy, Kellerman, an optician's assistant. Aged... - Morning, Kellerman. - ...somewhere between 30 and 60. We shared a bathroom with, uh, Tomas, Mrs. Kuntze's old cat. I don't think he ever said one word to me while I was there. Who? The cat or Kellerman? Very good. No, thanks. I, um... packed those in a long time ago. So tell me about... uh, about Clara. Yeah, what... what do you wanna know? - You live in Antwerp. - Mm-hm. - She's a... a doctor. - Doctor. Yeah. - You're a copywriter. - Mm-hm. What else? Any, any kids? No. No. We, um... Didn't, uh... Hasn't really worked out. That kinda thing. If, um... Yeah. Was... was it something I said? Oh, no. Don't be silly. No, um, things have been very hard on the home front of late but... - You wanna talk about it? - There's not a lot to say. Clara and I always intended to have children, but I've later backed away from it, I don't know why. So on Tuesday, she decided she'd waited long enough. She took the car and the dog and went to her sister's house. Cancelled the reservation for the house that we're about to rent in the south of France, - and doesn't answer my calls. - So that's why you came. No. How about you? Anyone? Um... Oh... I... I don't know, I've, um... - Taking some time out from that sorta thing. - Right. I'm not so good at the whole relationship, uh, thing, yeah. - Thank you. - She just, um... She started seeing somebody else. And everything just ran into the sand. I don't know. Maybe it s just as well. Yeah. So, uh, what do you remember about us? Us, your students... - Oh. - In class 3B at City College? I liked being your teacher. I liked it. Not everyone, of course. You know, some I like less, like, a lot less. But, you know, others more. It felt strange at times being in a position of authority when I was only a few years older than you. Don't forget tomorrow's the deadline for handing in your poetry analysis. Do not forget, please. But then that's how it was. I was your teacher and you were my student. Good. Every day, I'd pack up, and then home again to... to Mrs. Kuntze. And we lived in a beautiful neighborhood called the Pampa... well, the Pampas, you know. - Hi. How are you? - Nothing for you. Oh. Every time. I came and went as I pleased, really. - What have you been doing today? - Today was good. Today, uh, I have 30 students doing an essay - on narrative structure. - Oh, dear. - Yes. - Narrative... And Mrs. Kuntze, she was very kind. As was her cat, Tomas. And then every night I'd sit up, correct tests, prepare my work, eventually falling asleep, and waking again to another exciting day. When we got changed after gym class, I noticed she had a big bruise on her arm. She said she'd hurt herself on some gym equipment. - Oh, my God. - I didn't know how things were for her at home. - She never opened up about it. - She didn't with anyone. I mean, she could have moved in with me! I should have done something. It was before it was too late. That... that was... I don't think there's anything any of us could have done, you know? I remember that party as if it were yesterday, the one at the Limburg Rooms. When are you thinking? It was the last time I spoke to her, in the girls' loo. What time was that? Eleven? Half past. And anything else? I don't know. It's just... the whole thing's so sad. - Yeah. - She was so happy! Happy? She wasn't usually the sort - to be cheerful exactly. - No. It was as if something good had happened in her life. Anyway, that's all I got because her kid hit his head and started screaming and, you know. Great not to have kids. - Sorry, sorry. - I'm gonna go for a dip. - I think I need to cool down a bit. - Okay. Hey, uh, you know, Commissioner Keller is coming in an hour, if you wanna join. Um... maybe I could borrow the car? - Okay. - Great! Um, but, uh, my dad will kill you if anything happens to that car, you know. No, no, no, I'm... I'm serious, not a scratch. Nah, school's closed, it's summer. I know that. I know. I, um, I used to work here. I was just wondering if I could have a quick look around. Let me know when you leave. Thank you. Yeah. Can I come in? Of course, you can, yeah. Do with your help. All right. Okay. What can I help with? I can't make up my mind which one to choose? Okay. Ah... Journey to the End of the Night and Madame Bovary. Well, you've chosen two entirely different texts, both classics. Um, this is one of the world's best known love stories. Really, I'd like to write about both, but that might seem a bit overambitious. Yeah, maybe a little bit. Um, Céline, on the other hand... Uh, well, this is very dark. It's all about the First World War, a lot of anguish. He was almost obsessed by death, wasn't he? Oh, that's a little bit of an understatement, but, yeah. I don't know. I suppose if one... if one were to say that Céline is the true pessimist, then you could also say that Flaubert is his complete opposite. If I were you, I'd go for the Flaubert. - Hmm. - Because life is gloomy enough even without Céline in it. And a little bit of love, never did anybody any harm, so... - Thanks. - You're very welcome. Then I know. You've decided? Yeah. This one, of course. Thanks. In the beginning she was just missing, so we waited for her to return, but she never did, in the end. So we dredged the river, searched her cycle routes with dogs, formed human chains. I think we questioned close to 150 people. Wow. You had a few other suspects, didn't you? Before you detained Jacob Kall? Well, there was a known rapist who appears to have been in the area. An old jailbird who lived nearby. And her classmate, Emil Bachmann. That's what it said in the paper. He was in custody for a while, wasn't he? Arrested. Dr. No let him go. Oh, you mean, um... Neyman, the prosecutor? Neyman, yeah. Who actually had a point for once. Mm, could I have some more coffee? Three weeks later, you arrested Jacob Kall. Talk about dragging your feet. You'd been informed that he'd mistreated Vera for years. That was the only thing that annoys me. Yeah, but three weeks? Is that what you call good police work? Sometimes that's just how it is. But the worst of it was that it gave him plenty of time to cover his tracks. And although he'd scrubbed the place down, we quickly found Vera's blood in the kitchen. And eventually we found Vera's dress in her wardrobe, also covered in blood. We turned the house upside down. We dug up half the neighborhood. You didn't find anything? We didn't even find her bicycle. But, as I said, he had a fair amount of time. It still riles me. What about Vera's mother, Monica? What was her role in all of this? Who knows. We didn't manage to get one sensible word out of her. Do you think she was afraid? I don't think Vera Kall was the only one to come face-to-face with Jacob Kall's lunacy. Let's put it that way. Isn't it a little bit weird to sentence someone for a murder without a corpse? But not unique. And in this case there were, uh, number of indicators and technical evidence. And there was proof that she had been maltreated at home. - And now he's banged up for life. - Yes. Despite never having confessed to the crime. Jacob Kall is not the confessing type. So just turning the clock back a little bit. You interviewed some witnesses aside from the people at the Limburg Rooms. Yes, we had people who saw her cycling away from the party. Some claimed she cycled off in the wrong direction, towards town. Others saw her around the industrial estate. But everything points to having cycled home at about... about 11:30, in which case she would've got home about 45 minutes later. But that's not all, though, right? What are you suggesting? Emil Bachmann left the Limburg Rooms just before Vera. I know that for sure. But he didn't get home until half past 4:00 in the morning, that's what the newspaper guy said. It's in the Morning Post. - I have the cutting right here. - But one thing I can tell you, we had witnesses who saw Bachmann at the bus station at the exact same time as he was allegedly trying to break into a car on the other side of town. And there were people who could confidently say that they saw Vera Kall cycling home at 1:00 and 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. Even a drunk who says he saw her catch the first train to Altmaar at 6:15, wearing angel wings. If you take every tip-off seriously, you completely lose the plot. That's just how it is. And I think I'm going to call it a day. Okay. Well, thanks for coming all this way. Well, hello there. And who might you be lurking in the shadows? I'm Henry Maertens. I was one of the teachers at City College. Are you also involved in this film spectacle? Well, not exactly. I'm probably a bit like you, um, I'm a bit of an interview victim, I think. Oh, whatever. I'm off. Well, nice to meet you. Uh, good luck. Maybe you could cut that last bit. Yeah, I'll let you see the final edit before I lock it down, like I promised. - Um, one final question. - Yeah? Do you know if Vera had a boyfriend? Well, there was no indication, no one came forward. Her mobile was gone, and anyway she had one of those top-up cards. There was no diary or anything. No computer of her own. But I bet there was a bloke somewhere. She was an attractive looking girl to say the least. And her father wasn't the kind to encourage those kinds of liaisons. - So there's your motive. - But why would he... Jacob Kall is a true bastard. Let him rot. Paula, how about lunch in town on me? Well, I was all set up to interview you. There's no hurry for that, is there? No, not as far as I'm concerned. - Good. - Uh, good. Okay, let me just, um, uh, pack everything up. Yeah. - Is she not answering? - No. What's she like, Claire, is she attractive? I'll show you a picture if you like. Look, you're analog. I like that. Hmm. Thanks. Do you love her? Right now it feels... Feels a bit like I'm about to lose her, or something. Anyway. Emil Bachmann isn't answering either. I've emailed him and called him a number of times, but it's just... He's just declining my calls. It's hardly surprising, isn't it? If you've already emailed him, then he knows what it's about. He won't want to be reminded, will he? And he was never actually charged so... He was arrested for assault in town the previous year. Possession of drugs and bicycle theft. It was before your time, but everyone knew he could be fucking aggressive. Is this some kind of new theory of yours, some sort of alternative perpetrate? Emil left the party at 11:00, wasted, according to a number of witnesses including myself. And then wasn't seen again until half 4:00 in the morning by that paper delivery guy. I want to talk to him about what he was doing during those missing hours. If Emil did steal the car on the other side of town, I'm pretty sure he won't want to discuss it with you. Honorable guests, respected colleagues, and of course students, or maybe I should say cherished students. It must have been just after 10:00. Vasterman had been boring on for what felt like hours. And Emil was pretty drunk by then. Well, maybe not quite as glittering as it should have been. At some points there was quite a lot of tarnish going on. However on the whole... You know, I never got the stain out of that dress. ...was one of the great success... I was sitting just behind this pillar here, I remember. Couldn't see a damn thing. Congratulations to one and... Mate, just stop making that fucking noise, yeah. This isn't... No, seriously, you're pissing me off. - Take it easy. - Don't touch me, mate. - I just fucking said don't touch me! - Hey! Hey, come back inside. Don't be a dick. Fucking done, innit? Emil, where are you going? I don't have any notion of where Emil Bachmann was that night, but I'm guessing he must have left before me. I remember you said you were going home and you laughed and said we should go easy or something grown up, like that. - Good night. - Don't go, Henry. Don't leave me. - And then Claire turned up. - Yeah. I remember that. I think... well a bit too much wine I think. She wasn't the only one. - Another time. - Don't be such a boring old fart. - Good night. - Good night. But I don't remember if Vera was there. - Did you see her? - I actually can't remember. If Emil had been on his way home, it should have taken him 20 minutes, or 30 at the most, even in his condition. Emil lived there with parents and a younger sister. It's the third house on the left. His parents left Kaalbringen three or four years ago. And Vera would have taken this street on her way home. Of course, you wanna know what Emil was up to during those hours, yeah? Right. So all you do is push this red button. This feels wrong. Okay. It's rolling. Now you haven't done nada. Yes, I got your emails, and I'm not fucking interested, - otherwise I would've responded, wouldn't I? - I just... I wasn't sure, maybe that you didn't get them. It was the wrong email. Clearly, I got the fucking emails, and I'm not fucking interested, am I? Because this is my house, okay? I just wanna hear your side of the story. - I said fuck off! - Don't you wanna give your version of events, of like... You just wanna fuck with my life, don't you? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm leaving. Emil was a moron even back then. It's totally immoral to film someone who doesn't know he's being filmed. Immoral? Get off your high horse. It would've been immoral not to let him make a statement. That may be the case, but this definitely wasn't the way to do it, all right? I was the one who filmed him, all you have to do is pretend you weren't there. Emil, hi. Sorry. I... I just came around the back because I... I did ring on your door but I guess... You need to leave, Paula, you're trespassing. Um, I... I just... Yeah, I can't let you use that material, Paula. Well, it's my film so I can do whatever I fucking want. It was the wrong email. Clearly, I got the fucking emails, and I'm not fucking interested, am I? I... I thought this is meant to be the portrait of a young girl. You know, like a... "A community marked by grief," isn't that what you said? The... the loss of Vera? And instead you're... you're twisting it. You're turning it into some weird bloody police investigation. - It's wrong! - You know, um... It seems like you don't want me to make this film. You know, to be perfectly honest, no, I don't! Why did you come then? Well, that's a bloody good question! Look, I don't want you to leave. You and I obviously have a very different view of morality, Paula, 'cause you... you simply don't seem to give a shit. - You're right. - Yeah. I mean, if Emil doesn't wanna be in the film, he doesn't have to be. I was wrong. That is not what this film is supposed to be about. So delete it then. Okay. I'll delete it. I'll do it right now. So you'll stay? You know, to my mind, you should interview yourself. I mean, knew Vera as well as anyone, didn't you? Um, you know, I don't think anyone could know her, apart from possibly Claire. But why can't anyone know her? I guess it's like, like, B said, she was a... Well, she was the odd one out. To me she was a mystery. Or maybe you're just in love with her. Wasn't my type. You know, a week before Jacob Kall was arrested, - I was called in to see the headmaster. - Oh, wait... because I really wanna record you when you tell me. Okay? After dinner? After dinner, all right. Fine. Just gonna stick this on you. All right. - It's a mic. - All right. Got it. Okay. Keep it on your pockets. - Okay. - Here we go. It's very surreal. Um, I actually might have some more wine. - Do you want some? - No, no, I'm good. Thanks I want my wits about me. I'm recording. Now? While I'm washing. Is this some kind of kitchen sink drama you're making? You always need cutaways. Okay. - Here? - Yeah. Okay. Okay. So just... Uh, start talking about what you were talking about this afternoon. Oh, um... Well, yeah. Um, two weeks after Vera disappeared, I was called in to see Neumann-Hansen. The headmaster. Exactly. How are the reports coming along Henry? It can be a bit of a challenge the first time around. Yeah, to say the least. Um, the special assignment in literature, the essay, has been, uh, the deciding factor for most of them. It's a grave responsibility. - Mm-hmm. - Their futures are at stake. But I'm more than happy to help you if you feel unsure about it. Oh, thank... yes. I... I'm not gonna say no to that. I've only been with them a term so... - Good. - Oh, bring me the results, and we'll look over it together. Thank you. Thanks. Vera Kall... Did she have time to hand in her essay? Sadly, no. It didn't work out that way. I regretted it almost immediately, you know? You know, I... I knew very well that Vera had been getting good marks all the way through her time at college. And I should have just said to him, you know, I've given her the same marks that she's been getting during her Autumn term, but Neumann-Hansen insisted, you know, he felt that she must have had time to have written something before she disappeared, and if it wasn't in the locker at school then it must be at her house. So, I had to go around to see her parents, which is the absolute last thing I wanted to do. Even if, God forbid she's dead, she still deserves a proper school graduation report. Right. And it must be fair. Correct. Just because she's disappeared, doesn't mean you have to be excessively generous. Just fair. I think you understand what I mean. Erich Neumann-Hansen. Headmaster, City College. Hello. Henry Maertens. I'm the one who called. Yes. Might we come in? Oh, yes, please. Sorry about the food. We are the ones who should apologize, barging in like this during your lunch. But we have decided... that Vera must have her school reports, despite all. We mustn't lose hope. I'd like to take a look at a school essay that Vera was working on. I don't know if perhaps you know where Vera keeps... Of course, we know. I assume you mean her special report on Céline that was due to be turned in Friday? I was anything but comfortable with the situation. Hated it. - Top drawer. - All right. Thanks. I don't want anything removed from here. Yeah. Of course not. Of course. Could I get a moment to myself? At first, I found it very hard to concentrate. That was largely because I could... I could feel the presence of her father. His eyes just, like, drilling into my back. Even though he wasn't really in the room. But I could feel him. And then I got drawn into what she'd written. She's very good. She'd largely finished the work. And when I got home I regretted the visit. It just felt like we'd encroached or had butted into their sorrow. What did it really matter, you know, what final grade Vera received? Sorry for disturbing. Have you seen Tomas? Oh. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, come on. Come on. Two days later, Jacob Kall was arrested. How did that feel? - Surreal. - In what sense? In the sense that we'd been allowed to walk around the kitchen where Vera had been beaten to death by her father. Look... Samaria. It's for sale. Did you bring your camera? Oh, the house isn't going anywhere. Feels very strange coming back here. Really, what I what I was thinking. She's buried somewhere under your feet. Welcome. I must apologize for the state of things here, but the place is sold as seen. Perfect environment for children to grow up in. Great potential for conversion, renovation... Or rip it down, build your own. Why don't you have a look around? Thanks. Contents included. It's exactly like I remember it. Pieter Vogel. What? I'm just thinking maybe she had a thing with Pieter Vogel. Really? Have you spoken to him about it? No, he would never have been able to keep his mouth shut. Oh. One thing's for certain, anyway, Pieter never slept in this bed, because if he had, Jacob Kall would've knocked him off as well. Mm. Why don't you have a look around? So, when did you meet Clara? Clara? Why do ask? Just curious. We met a year... a year or two after this in Antwerp. What about when you were living here in Kaalbringen? - What? - Well, did you have some special lady friend? No. No, that wasn't, um... It wasn't in the script, so to speak. - Groundhog Day. - Exactly. Well, I know a couple of the girls from our class who were more than interested. - Taboo. - What did you say? Never on the cards. I don't think I found Henry incredibly attractive. Um, he was so sweet and, sort of, cute. And if you made a special effort and seemed a bit interested he blushed. So, without Henry Maertens, that last term would have been bloody boring. Yeah, so, all the girls had a crush on Henry Maertens? - Mm-hm. - What about the boys? - Who did they love? - You know... Yes, but you say it. Vera, of course. I think out of everyone you really knew her the best. Yeah. Vera was... the finest, the best, and I still miss her, so terribly still, and I think I told her everything. She was always so wise and thoughtful, as if she knew everything. Did she ever tell you anything about herself, her life? Oh, no. She didn't. Hardly anything. Some things. I know she had a tough time at home... I saw her bruises. She... she tried covering them up with makeup. Hi. Yes, yeah. I... I have it right here. That's... that's why I tried to call you earlier. Um... Ah, no, it's in the car. Never talked about it ever, she didn't want pity. Do you think maybe she was gay? - What? - Well, just, you know, that... As you said, all the boys were interested, but she was just really didn't seem to care about at all. It's not so very surprising, you know. Vera was smart. And she just wanted school to be over so she could start living. She longed to get away from her family. No wonder. And did she... Did she have a boyfriend? Not that I know of. Maybe Maertens, if so. Henry Maertens? Yeah. But she never told me anything. Yeah. Great. Yeah. I'll... I'll speak to you. But if you'll ask me, I'd say Henry. When did you meet with Claire Meitens? Before you and I met in Maardam. And when were you gonna tell me that? - Well... I... - Or... You know, I don't know what to think, Henry, because I know that you haven't been honest, - and I know that you've lied. - Lied?! Lied, Paula?! You're the one who's lied! - Yes, okay! - Yeah, do you know what I think this is?! This is jealousy! That's what this bloody film is! Your jealousy and the fact that Vera wasn't in love with you. - Okay, that's not true. - 'Cause that's what this whole bloody film is, isn't it? It's not actually about Vera, it's about your gigantic narcissistic ego. Yeah, I was in love with her. But I accepted that it wasn't mutual. You see, I knew it. You've got a fucking weird way of working, you know that? I mean, you and your twisted theories. And whether something is true or not, it just seems to be fucking irrelevant to you. Yeah, well, if it's not true, Henry, then why don't you explain this? "Be thou the rainbow and the storms of life. -H" For Henry? Where did you get this? I found it in Samaria about a month ago. - You don't know shit. - And you do? I loved Vera... and she loved me. No camera. No camera. Just give me some time. There's a darkness to it and a sense of foreboding to it. But there really is a sense of passion. There really is a sense of passion, but let me ask you this one question: Do you not think there is a pessimism to the whole thing, do you not think that there is death on every single page? I would say exactly the opposite. I think the language is so full of life and so incredibly beautiful. I would like to write about Céline's use of language instead. I set aside about 30 minutes, I think, but we must have sat there for about two hours. I would never normally have devoted so much time to just one student, but, uh... I didn't want to leave, And I liked her being there. I liked... I liked her laugh, and her thoughts, and her... Her everything, I suppose. We agreed to meet again the very next afternoon, I remember. Under the pretext of Vera wanted to talk about her idea of... of Céline's use of language, but we both knew that wasn't the reason. I mean, we... we made up various different excuses along the way just to be together. It's getting a bit cold. I'm gonna run in and get a jumper, okay? Do you... do you want one? No, thanks. The library obviously had its fixed opening hours... but I had a key. So, we knew we wouldn't be disturbed, well, at least for a little while. You must've had a fuck load of luck. Well, then, maybe. What would've happened if someone had found out? Honestly speaking, I don't know. I mean, it's out of the question, of course, it was taboo, like I said. But also... beautiful. Hm... The following week I, uh, smuggled her back to Mrs. Kuntze's house. I think Vera told her parents... she was staying on the library or something for an extra few hours. Maybe it's a bit exaggerated to say that I smuggled her in. I'm sure, Mrs. Kuntze would've been very accommodating. - Meow. - Shh. We just... we just had to be very careful. It's just one, one bit... that I have to talk to you about. Vera absolutely did not want her parents to find out that... - It's one bit. - I can wait. It wasn't even an option and I understood it. I'd seen the marks on her... on her body, not... not that she talked about it. Maybe it was then that I realized that I was actually exposing her to a risk. And now you're in trouble, I'd say. And when I was alone, and all of this initial rush had... had settled... I knew that our relationship just could never work. What about at the party, then? On the last night, did you not see each other? But of course, from time to time, you might just find yourself needing a bit of actual guidance from your highly salaried lecturer. And as you look up eagerly seeking his attention, you are met with the sight of your eminently qualified tutor, Wasserman, sitting bolt upright in his opulent chair behind his imposing desk, taking a nap... It's not true. It's all a lie. How does he defy the laws of physics? We were able to internalize this extraordinary feat of vertical hibernation with the help of your Jovan's mobile. And, as you know, it was published eventually in the college magazine. Even though it was very dangerous for Vera and I to see each other, my body just ached for her. Our only element of regret, looking back on it, is that we didn't manage to record the accompanying sound effects. Good night, kids. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Good night. - Don't go, Henry. Dance with me. All right. Good night, good night. I have to go, I have to go, I have to go. All right. Don't be such a boring old fart. Okay. Good night. Emil Bachman, I think had stumbled home, and then I went down to our usual meeting place. Far too early, as it turned out. I thought it'd take 15 minutes to get onto the bridge. I must have walked very quickly because it wouldn't have taken me more than five, I think. And so many thoughts were passing through my head as I waited and I remembered... Has she snuck at home or has she stayed behind at the party? I didn't know what to think. But then she arrived, slightly out of breath, on her bicycle. And then we went back to the Pampas, to my place. You're right, it is... it is getting cold, isn't it? And then you went back to Mrs. Kuntze's. She never went home, is that what you're saying? I'm gonna go get a... a sweater. - Well, I'll get it. - Coming right back. Henry, I can... I can explain. Stop. Stop, stop! I can... Come back! No! Stop! No! What the fuck are you doing? You're a sick person, you know that. No, please... Oh... No. No. Oh, no. - Are you awake, darling? - Yeah. I have to go. We should talk, Vera. We're always talking. I don't think what we're... I don't think what we're doing is right at this point in time. I'm sorry. What? I think we should maybe take a break, you and I. The thing is, Vera, you never tell me anything... ever. And I... I do see what's happening, I do understand. I know this man is your father, but you have got to report him to the police. I'm saying this for your best interest... And that would be to not be there for me? - Of course not. - How soothing. You can't continue like this. Vera, Vera. Wait, Vera. Suspected assault, damage to property, but you are also wanted for questioning... for withholding information into the investigation of the murder of Vera Kall. In other words, Vera Kall did not cycle home at midnight but three hours later. Now, although you were well aware that the police investigation into her disappearance was not making any progress, you chose not to tell us what you knew. I thought she'd ran away. I thought she was staying away on purpose. I thought she'd get in touch... once things had calmed down. Or you're lying and we've got the wrong bloke locked up in prison. I did not kill Vera, all right. I would never... All right, then. I don't happen to think that either. I loved her. Hmm. But apparently, not enough to share with us what you knew. Well, that was the last thing she would have wanted, for God's sake. She was terrified of her father. If we had known then what we know now we probably would have arrested Jacob Kall a few weeks earlier. We might have found the remains, or at best, found her still alive. He was hitting her. I saw the bruises on her body, if he had found out... I didn't want her to put her through that risk. How many times do I have to tell you? Well, either that, or you were just too much of a coward to own up to what you had done. - No. - I mean, a teacher seducing a student. Maybe not illegal but inappropriate. In no way are you being dropped from this investigation, but we're not gonna hold onto you any longer. As for the assault, you can expect a... a fine and a conditional sentence. Should I call the police? That's ten thousand Euros. It should be enough to cover the cost of your equipment, at least. Move. Are you coming? All her things were gone by the time I got back to Antwerp. Was she answering her phone? What did she say? What? Nothing endearing, then. I miss Clara. I miss my dog. Yeah. You've paid a high price. Me too, in a way. Obviously, I shouldn't have done what I did either. Definitely crossed the line. It's really made me think, I mean, your reaction was totally justified and I should prob... No, I should... I should apologize. No, it's wrong. I'm the one who's at fault, and if I had just told the truth when all this happened all those years ago, and then... Then I'd never have anything to hide from you. Instead, I've just chosen to keep a secret all these years. I loved Vera. My God, you must have hated Jacob Kall. Probably still hate him. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I hate him with every bit of my heart. I've dropped the project. It's not gonna be a film. Good. It's just too, uh... Too heavy. Sad. Too private. Sometimes it is just better to let things lie, like you said. And, uh... and maybe I just have to accept that she lies buried somewhere, the forest's edge, and that the memory of Vera is more important. Sometimes I like to pretend that the drunk at the station... - did actually see her. - Mm. That she'd reached an end point that morning and... managed to get away. That in spite of everything, she actually boarded the first train to Altmaar, while the rest of us were lying there, sleeping it off, she packed her bag and left Samaria for good. Perhaps without even knowing where she was going. And for the first time she felt free. Really free. I think she found a better life somewhere else; another town, another country... because she was worth that much. Vera deserved the best of everything. - Who's that? - No idea. I said her name was Clara, and she works in our Brussels office unless I'm mistaken. - Thank you. - Thank you.
