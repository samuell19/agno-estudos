(whimsical orchestral music) - [Man On TV] All right, fellas, I thought we went through this already. (metal clanking) - [Mrs. Colby] Is that the mail, Andy? (monster growling on TV) Andy? Come here and bring me the mail. (monsters growling on TV) - [Monster] Silence! - Please don't touch that, honey. - Why do you have wear makeup for? - Because. - Because why? - Because I'm going on a job interview and I need to look the best I can. - What's an interview? - Will you do Mommy a great big favor and go get me the mail? Bonnie, go. (Bonnie sighing) (men shouting on TV) - It's my turn to sit in the chair. - Go away. - It's my turn. - Leave me alone, you stupid copycat. - Mommy, Andy's sneaking out! - I am not. - [Mrs. Colby] Andrew Colby, you come here right this minute! - You could grow up to be a bad lady. - [Mrs. Colby] I thought I asked you to bring me the mail. - I forgot. - [Mrs. Colby] Well, you'd better start remembering things right now. Honey, we need this job and I want you to take care of your sister while I'm gone. - But Luke got laser tag, and he asked me to be the first one to play with him. - [Mrs. Colby] I want you to babysit your sister while I go on this interview. I don't think that's asking too much. - But he's waitin' for me to come over. - Andy, no. Now look, I'm gonna make you both some sandwiches and then I'm leaving. I expect you to be nice to your sister. It won't hurt you to spend some quality time with her. - Oh, Mom, give me a break! - Oh, come on. You can play a game or you could watch TV. - Mom? - Yes. - Can I rent a movie for us to watch together? - Andy, I've got to leave in 15 minutes. - I can make it. I'll ride my bike. Please? - (Sighs) all right, just don't get anything too scary for Bonnie. - Don't worry. (whimsical orchestral music) (tire skidding) - [Man] Hey! (whimsical orchestral music) - [Clerk] That tape doesn't belong here. That's not for children. - Where's Mr. Edwards? - On vacation. I'm watching the store while he's gone. Can I help? - Well, I'm lookin' for somethin' for my sister, but she's seen all these. Do you have any thing new? Please, mister, I'm in a big hurry. - All the children's tapes we have are in this section. (eerie music) - What's that one? - Which one? - [Andy] Wait, wait, that one, right there. (eerie music) The Incredible Video Adventure. Sounds good, I know she hasn't seen it. - I don't know if your sister's old enough for this tape. - Don't worry, I'll be there. - You'll have to be very careful with it. There's only one tape like this in the entire world. - Please, mister, I promise, I'll bring it back first thing in the morning. - Well, all right. (eerie music) There is something you must remember. Never let go of the remote control. (paper rustling) - Thanks, mister. - And Andrew, don't sit too close. (eerie music) (water bubbling) - Don't play with your food, Bonnie. (heavy footsteps falling) - I'm back. - What took you so long? Oh, never mind. Look, I have to go right now. Your lunch is on the table. Don't forget to clean your plate when you're finished. And, um, I'll be back at 5:30, okay? (kiss smacking) Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Oh, and Andy, be nice to your sister. (whimsical orchestral music) (water bubbling) - That's disgusting. - You do it. - Do not. - Do too. Do too. - Hey, you wanna watch a video? This is a new one. They just got it in. - You gonna? - Yeah, sure, come on. Come on. (video tape rattling) You ready? - Uh-huh. - All right. (heroic orchestral music) - [Narrator] Long ago, in a land far away, there lived a man who could make dreams come true. (thunder crashing) And he did-- (phone ringing) because he was a wonderful wizard with magical powers. But sometimes, ... - Hello? I'm coming, I had to do something for my mom. - [Narrator] Pull rabbits out of hats and sawing ladies in two. People traveled from distant towns so he could make their dreams come true. (static hissing) - Come on down, Bonnie Colby. Come on down and let Lord Chroma make your dreams come true for you. You know, whether it's an old dream or whether it's a spanking new dream, Lord Chroma can make it all happen for you. - It's just gonna take a few more minutes, okay? He's such a klutz, he'll probably break it. You gotta let me be first. - Bonnie, Bonnie. Come here. - You promised. - [Lord Chroma] I want to show you something. - [Andy] You promised you'd wait for me. Yes, something wonderful, something you've never seen before. Isn't that wonderful, hmm? Would you like to have one? You can, yes. (eerie music) (electronic humming) - I'll be there in 10 minutes, don't worry. (Bonnie screaming) (ominous music) Luke, hold on a second. (phone clacks) Bonnie, what's goin' on? - It's 257 to you. Do you know how long I've been looking for that color? (tense music) It's perfect in my dining room. And to think I found it in your beautiful eyes, hmm, hmm? I used to have 39,998 colors. - Bonnie, I know you're hiding someplace. - [Lord Chroma] Now I have 39,999. - Hey, we can go out and get some ice cream. - [Bonnie] Let go, let me go! - Bonnie? - [Bonnie] Andy, help me, help me! - Darn it, Bonnie. You're gonna get me in big trouble. (videotape rewinding) - Now I have 39,999. - Let go, let me go, let me go! - Bonnie, this isn't funny. (videotape rewinding) - Isn't that wonderful, hmm? Would you like to have one? You can. Just come here. Come up to the screen, yes. (tense music) (electronic humming) It's 257 to you. Do you know how long I've been looking for that color? (video rewinding) (electronic humming) (tense music) - Bonnie? Can you hear me? (tense music) (creaking) (electronic buzzing) (tense music) Weird. This is rad. (Andy yelling) (wind blowing) Bonnie? (electronic humming) Bonnie? (eerie music) (electronic trilling) - Andy, help me! Andy, Andy! Andy, (static hissing) help me! Andy! (static hissing) Andy, help me! (static hissing) (electronic thwack) - Guards, guards! I just don't know what it is. You can't get decent help any more. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're coming with me. (Lord Chroma laughing) (Bonnie screaming) (whimsical orchestral music) (electronic trilling) (eerie music) (wind blowing) - [Andy] Bonnie! - [Space Raider] You wanna do something about Robot Nine? - Bonnie? - They just tried to load Robot 18. (electric trilling) (men shouting) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Security breach, security breach! (exciting music) (laser guns firing) - [Man On Loudspeaker] This is an emergency!' - Wow, it's just like Star Wars! (laser guns firing) (man shouting) (laser guns firing) - [Man on Loudspeaker] Squad Nine to Depot Three, get to cargo bay 17, this is an emergency! Squad Nine to Depot Three, security breach! Depot Three, this is-- (laser guns firing) (electronic warbling) (laser guns firing) (heroic music) (laser guns firing) (man groaning) (laser guns firing) - Jess, we're covering you.

You get this crate moving. - [Man on Loudspeaker] They're stealing ship 17. Get all security forces to Depot Three. This is full priority! All security forces, all assignments are superceded. All security forces to Depot Three. Defend ship 17. (control buttons clicking) Depot Three, security breach, Depot Three. This is an emergency. - Back to our ship. They know where to link up with us. (adventurous music) (metal crashing) (laser guns firing) (engines roaring) (tense music) - Full thrust. Program for sector 309. (adventurous music) (engines roaring) (tense music) - [Hawk] We got the cargo ship away clear. - Let's catch up to 'em. (engines roaring) (tense music) (control buttons clicking) (adventurous music) Is Jess hanging on? - [Hawk] He's bleeding all over the place. - [Man In Black Jacket] As bad as you were that time on Cygnus Four? - [Hawk] Worse. - [Man In Black Jacket] I held you together, just get him on board. - [Hawk] Used to be you could steal something without gettin' your head blown off. - [Man In Black Jacket] If we unload that ship, we'll never have to steal anything again. Where's that medical kit? - I don't know, I saw it here the other day. - [Man In Black Jacket] Well, find it. (Jess groaning) (air hissing) (paper rustling) - Remind me to talk to you when you're done with this. I've been having these headaches. - I don't do headaches. I just do stuff that bleeds. (Jess groans) (sinister music) More oxygen, more oxygen! (Jess groans) - We're losing him. (mechanical humming) - Breathe, breathe! You never could follow orders, breathe! (mechanical humming) (mask clacking) At least he didn't die for nothing. We got the ship. - The ship's empty. - Not quite empty. - Hi. I'm tryin' to find my sister. (electronic trilling) - [Bonnie] Let me go! (whimsical orchestral music) Stop, stop! - Quiet, child. Look at my castle. Red and yellow, blue and green and every color in between, all the colors of a childhood dream. To possess them all, that is my scheme. (electronic trilling) (somber music) (door shutting) (somber music) (suspenseful music) - I want those thieves destroyed. No one steals my ship and lives. (suspenseful music) (engines roaring) - [Woman] Zadar's spiders are coming in! - [Man] Get outta my seat! (adventurous music) - We can take it. - Sure, there's only two of them and six of us. - Five! (adventurous music) (laser missiles firing) (adventurous music) (laser missiles firing) (engines roaring) (adventurous music) - Hit it! (engines roaring) (laser missiles firing) (ship exploding) (laser missiles firing) (adventurous music) (ship exploding) - The plasma module's hit. - Well, get the auxiliary. (laser missiles firing) I thought you fixed it. - It'll kick in. - Three o'clock. (laser missiles firing) - [Man In Vest] Aw, it's not kickin' in! - Keep firing! I've got a plan. - What, do you think I'm going on vacation? - Keep my seat warm. (heroic music) (laser missiles firing) (ship exploding) - Reminds me of a girl I once dated. I think it was on Epsilon Iridani. Just couldn't quite get to her (groans). Zadar will get us for sure if we can't make the jump to hyperspace. - I can do it. - You wanna give it a try? - Sure! - Help us out and we'll try to find your sister. (suspenseful music) (electronic hissing) That's the problem, that connector's loose. - [Man In Vest] Don't let it touch him. - [Captain] We'll get you something. Get him a pair of gloves. - Gloves. You know, while we're fightin' for our lives here, there are guys sleepin' in warm beds, guys eatin' gourmet meals. - You wouldn't know a gourmet meal if you sat on it. - There's another one coming in. (laser missiles firing) - Laser three's out. (ominous music) (laser missiles firing) - Watch yourself. What's his name? I don't know. What's your name? - Andy. - Watch yourself, kiddo. (metal clanking) (tense music) (laser missiles firing) (ship exploding) Shove that connector back! (suspenseful music) (laser missiles firing) (ship exploding) (Andy groans) - Get us outta here! - We still haven't got any power. (laser missiles firing) (suspenseful music) - [Zadar] Prepare to fire the stellar converter. Three, two, one, goodbye, little people. (laser missiles firing) - [Man In Vest] It's kickin' in! (whooshing) (Zadar groaning) (engine humming) (electronic trilling) - Brightest white and darkest blue, open up and let me through. (electronic throbbing) (electronic trilling) (adventurous music) - We need to steal some fuel, then we'll go look for your sister. The first sign of trouble, I'll come in shooting. (engine humming) (thunder crashing) (suspenseful music) (thunder crashing) (tense music) - [Andy] It's like a gas station for spaceships. (tense music) (footsteps running) - No!

Hawk, flight plan! I'm dead. Help, anyone! Anybody, help! (static hissing) (electronic humming) - Do you always make so much noise? - Who are you? - Well, the question is who are you? You're the one standing about in my home, screaming and yelling. - Well, I got shot by a blaster. Thought I was dead. - (Scoffs) it was probably only a movie. - Yeah, I guess it was. This is your home? - Well, in a manner of speaking, I have many. But, if you look at it from a different viewpoint, I have none. You could say I'm everywhere and nowhere all at the same time (laughs). - Who are you? - Not who, what? I am a glitch. I live in between channels and on video cassettes. - Well, I'm glad I'm not dead. - Oh, well, I should hope so. Drink? - No thanks. - And what are you ? - Oh, my name's Andy. I'm looking for my sister, Bonnie. Have you seen a girl with blue eyes about this big, no, this big? - Hm, little girl, blue eyes, hmm, I see so many. Well, it's hard. There's 75 channels and a lot going on. - Oh, she was kidnapped by a weird guy wearing a black hat. - Oh, that's a lot of help. - And a cape and a glove. - A cape. I can think of two thoroughly unpleasant fellows who might fit the bill. Count Shurka or Lord Chroma. - Where can we find them? - Well, Shurka's only a few channels beyond this one. Chroma lives in the higher channels. Terrible place, no color, I hear, just black and white. - Well, thanks for all your help. - (Sputtering) watch out! Aim that thing some place else, it's dangerous! - Dangerous? It's just a remote control. - Just a remote control, he says. Ever freeze frame anybody before, or put them into rewind? Well, I can see it's all a bit difficult for a boy like yourself. - But I've got to find my sister, especially before my mom gets home. - Well, all right, I can see you need help. Aim your control over there, yes, and hit the channel selector for your next channel. (electronic blip) (suspenseful music) Oh, dear, next channel.

Help me! (birds chirping) Help! - [Glitch] Andrew, use your freeze frame. - Well, I can't. I dropped my remote control. - [Glitch] And I dropped my Kool-Aid.

(Glitch scoffs) - No. - Well, I guess not then. See you. - That man has only one thing on his mind. - Oh, you know what? We should've asked him if he knew Shurka.

It's all wrong and it's ugly. (creepy laughing) (Bonnie screaming) No, let me go! (frantic orchestral music) (door closing) - [Chroma] Ugly, ugly? What do you know about ugly? When you get to be my age... - [Bonnie] I hate you. - Come to think of it, you never will get to be my age. (Bonnie screaming) (ominous music) (leaves rustling) (fire crackling) - Kor? - What? - Who are those guys? - [Kor] Cyclops. - What'd you do? - Something really terrible. I didn't marry his sister. - Why not? - [Kor] Because she's his twin sister. Look at him. (electronic trilling) (Chroma laughing) (metal clanking) - You know, very soon, soon, your color essence will be part of my beautiful world. Or maybe I'll use your head as a centerpiece for my new table. - No! (electronic trilling) - Whoa, what are they doing now? - [Kor] They're preparing a big wedding dinner. (fire crackling) I can choose, be the guest of honor or the dinner. (Cyclops growling) - Arrrgh! - [Cyclops] The good friar is very eager to perform the ceremony. Right, friar? So, do we marry you or marinate you? - I'll tell you, Cyclops, I'd do it but I just can't handle in-laws. - [Cyclops] Laugh while you can. - Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food? - [Cyclops] So it's dinner, then? Good, I'm hungry. (birds chirping) - Are you still there? - Yes, Kor. - Try to untie me. (fire crackling) - [Cyclops] Ummm. - [Kor] Reach down, reach down and put some dirt in my hand. Okay, now, get out of here as quickly as you can. - I see you've put on a little weight. More for everybody. - You know, as they say, from ashes to ashes, dust to dust. (Cyclops screaming) (suspenseful music) (man growls) (Kor growls) (man growls) (whimsical piano music) That's my sword. Hey, put my sword down, put it down! (Cyclops growling) What are you doing?

I've never seen the dome go backwards like that before. How'd you do it? How'd you do it? - I have magic powers. (suspenseful music) Why do you look like that? - Like what? - Like an old TV set, no color. - Oh, Lord Chroma took my colors. It's what he does here. Now come on, how'd you make the dome stop? - If I show you, will you tell me where my sister is? - [Gatekeeper] I already told you, I don't know. - Well, what do you know? - I know you'd better not get caught here or else you'll end up on the back of a milk carton. - Don't worry, I got this in case of emergencies.

That's Italian for blonde, because of my hair. Do you like my hair? - Well, I'm looking for my sister. - Oh, does she have blonde hair? - No, yeah, I don't know. Where is she? - Walls aren't supposed to talk, but who's listening anyway. Lord Chroma has her in his lab, in the dungeon. - Well, how do I get there? - Oh, you don't want to go there. - Yes, I do. I've got to find her. - Besides, you can't get there from here. - Everyone keeps telling me that. What do I do? - Go back to the hall of colors, through the white door. - Back? - This way. (door creaking) Good luck. - Thanks! (low rumbling) (tense music) (heavy breathing) (electronic zapping) - What happened? - I froze you. Now tell me where my sister is or you'll be playing freeze tag permanently. - Okay, okay, is that how you stopped the dome? - Yes! Now tell me where the dungeon is. - You just need to go downstairs. Always take the darker door. It's easy. - Okay, let's go. - Oh, no, she's your sister. - You can either lead me or make like marble. (Gatekeeper sighing) - The doors are always changing. This time it's eyes, next time it could be TV screens. Everything changes except the colors. The dark ones lead down, the light ones up. - Well, if you know so much, why don't you try to escape? - (Scoffing) can you imagine. Hi, Mom, I'm back. I'm sorry I lost all my colors. Please don't get mad, I won't ever do it again, I promise. - Well, what's the real reason? - [Bonnie] No! - Shh, be quiet. This is it. - [Chroma] Don't worry, this will only sting a little. - [Andy] How do we get in? - We gotta make it close. - Close? - Open is closed, so closed is open. If you can't get in when it's open, you can when it's closed. (electronic zapping) (electronic humming) - [Andy] Stop that! - Andy! - Well, who are you? - I'm her brother and you can't do that. - I can't, why not dude? - Because I said so. - (Laughs) but this is my castle.
