NAVAL ACADEMY No… Gianni, haven't you had enough yet? This mania for singing… I know. I got punished. I risked being kicked out of the Academy. I like to sing, and we're not in the Academy here! We Aleardis love three things. Sea, adventure and music. There's no sea here. Certainly no adventure. So I sing! I am crying and you ask me why I don't want to tell you anything But you will understand You will hear my voice When you Won't be able To see me anymore I will say "You only like doing what you please" You don't care If you hurt me My voice will tell you What I Think of you The truth I know you will be sorry Yes, I know how much you'll cry But when you will realize it It will be too late It will be too late I am crying and you ask me why I don't want to tell you anything But you will understand My voice will tell you What I think of you The truth The truth The truth Rome! Ten days of life, and then the sea! The sea is our life! I meant life on land. After this brief vacation, we'll board a cruiser. When we next set foot on land, we will be midshipmen. Let's think about women. There aren't many on the Andrea Doria. In fact, none at all! Saro! - We're finally at my home, Saro. - Good day, sir. Welcome, Mr. Gianni! You like it, Saro? - Good day, Tommaso! - Welcome back, sir. - Thank you. Anything new? - The little count is in school. The Count, your grandfather, is in his studio. The Count, your father, is on the torpedo boat. My mother? The countess won at bridge last night. She's been waiting by the window for your arrival since this morning. Saro, let's go! - I'll take the package. - Thank you. Halt. - Mom! - Gianni! - How are you, Commander? - Fine, Countess. I'm glad to have you with me, even for a short while. This is Saro. Spampinato. I know you from Gianni's letters. You're number one at the Academy. His friendship with me has him mixing up first with last. Aleardi! Yes, sir, Admiral! - Granddad. - How's it going, you old sea wolf? With storms and tempests we get by, young admiral. Good! I'm glad to see you again. I have to talk to you. - I have a guest, Granddad. - I know. Mr. Spampinato. We'll get acquainted later. May I steal my grandson for ten minutes? He's yours, Dad. Mr. Spampinato and I will get to know each other. Thank you, Luisa. Please, young man! Come, Gianni. To what do we owe the pleasure of having you as our guest? To the pleasure of meeting you, to Gianni's insistence, and because my dad is at sea on the San Marco. Is he the commander? No, Countess. He's the boatswain. A boatswain is the real commander of a ship. When you become an officer, you'll realize that. I know all that you did and I'm not surprised. Women, right? Women! Toujours la femme! We Aleardis are capable of any folly for a woman. When I was a student, as a marine guard, and as commander, I got in all sorts of trouble! I got punished more than all the sailors of the fleet. And yet I became an admiral. You know why? Because I had the sea in my blood, like you! No, Miss Gigliola. He's with the commander. Tell me something. Do you like that Di Blasio girl? Gigliola. I like all beautiful women! Good. Just as I do. - What about Gigliola? - A little more than the others. Watch out, because your mother and the girl's mother are organizing a party for you and her. The two mothers are in cahoots! It's a plot. They want to corner you with that girl! Don't worry. It's too soon to marry. Good for you! You've always got time to get a wife, especially a Navy officer! - Freedom is on the sea! - Undoubtedly so, son! When you are on a ship, you are in command! And when you return home, your wife gives the orders. Even if you become an admiral like me, you'll feel like a simple sailor with her. Remember that! Good morning, Mr. Maurizio. - Did Gianni arrive? - Yes, a short while ago. Your book bag. Catch, Pasquale! Can't you see? You need to learn to drive! - Gianni! - Maurizio! - How's it going, little brother? - Fine, big brother. - How's school? - Awful, big brother. For me too, little brother. - It's in our blood! - Let's worry about health! - Yes… - We must go to Mom now. - Sailor Aleardi, in my studio. - Yes, sir! You can go. Come in. Boatswain Tommaso reporting. Excuse the delay. Forget it. - Alright! - Sailor on board. Ready for drill. Go! Faster! Yes, sir. Faster! Faster! This sailor deals up with rolling marvelously. Faster! Halt! Get off. Why are you getting so affectionate? He is simply dizzy, sir. One of these days I'll degrade you. - You want to go ahead, sir? - One of these days! - Where have you taken me? - We are ruled by adventure! The girls here jump on us and never let us go! You want two girls? You want them? I can find 2,000! - What are you doing? - Wait and see! If something between us should change There will be a sign in your eyes The sun will leave your eyes If something between us should change I will no longer need The words you will say In your face I will see if I've lost you Forever If our love should end Words won't be needed I will see the truth on your face If our love should end And I will go alone Into the world without you I will be very sad if I lose you forever Tell me again, my love That you will not leave me If I tell you these things It's because I'm afraid of losing you If something between us should change Words will no longer be needed On your face I will see the truth If something between us should change And I will go alone Into the world without you I will be very sad if I lose you Love Forever Forever Miss! Miss. - Are you here alone? - No, with a girlfriend. - And you? - With a friend. Student? - More or less. And you? - More or less. - Embassy stuff? - More or less. Do you come here often? - It's the first time. - Me too. - Do you like it? - It's fun. Want to sit down? - I'm here with my girlfriend. - She'll look for you. What if she doesn't find me in this confusion? Great. You'll stay with me. Let's go. One! Strange. We made friends without knowing each other. Maybe we recognized each other. - I've never seen you before. - Maybe we met in our dreams. Yes, but dreams end. - Then close your eyes. - Why? Close them. Our dream must continue. It doesn't depend on us. Sooner or later we wake up. See? It doesn't depend on us. Next time, we'll dream somewhere there aren't any waiters. My name is Gianni. - My name is… - Wait. Don't say it. I want to guess. - Liù. - How did you do that? I guessed! It wasn't destiny that we met. In fact, my girlfriend brought me here. Without her, Gianni wouldn't have met Liù, and Liù wouldn't have met Gianni. Liù! - I have to go now. - Why? My girlfriend is calling me. Have her come here. She's calling me to leave. Stay, Liù. - I'll take you back. - I can't. But it's still early. Thank you. - It's late for me. - Then I'll see you tomorrow. I'll wait here, at this table. Don't wait for me. I won't be able to come. Do all you can to make it. Let me go, please. Only if you promise to come. I hope I can, but I can't promise. I'll wait for you, and you'll come. These moments spent together can't be just a memory. For the thirsty poet, a tear from crying is worth more than a sip of fountain water. Liù? Liù, let's go! Liù… - The countess is calling you. - I heard. Then go. - You're not coming to bed? - Yes. After the evening check, your husband will join you. Yes, right away. Locked. The kitchen… All of it? Yes, sir. - Good evening, Mr. Gianni. - Good evening. Excuse me. - When? - Two hours ago. Thanks. - Put the car in the garage, please. - Of course, sir. - Good night. - What happened? Nothing. Let's go. Gianni! Dad, when did you arrive? Just before your mother finished her bridge game. - She just went up. - Thanks for waiting for me. Saro Spampinato. My pleasure. You're my son's good friend and best student in the course. You risked being expelled. Dad, I'd like… I'm Commander Aleardi now. Listen, son. If the sea is not for you, it's useless to board. Stay on land. But if you board the Andrea Doria you must land as an officer, a real officer. You must decide, now! I've decided, Commander. I will board the Andrea Doria. Good. You'll always go out in uniform. An Academy student wears it, even on leave. That goes for you too. - Good night, boys. - Commander. Mrs. Di Blasio always wins. I don't know how she does it. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - What do you mean? - I said nothing. What is it? - May I dare? - Yes. You've been here a long time. May I dare? I'll dare! Your robe is out of place. Why? The commander is here. Oh, right! Poor dear. I left him alone for my game! I'll go be forgiven. Yes, but not in that robe. What's wrong with it? It's blue, Countess, like the waves of the sea the commander arrived from. - The monotony must be interrupted. - You think? Yes. After three months of navigation, he needs something that doesn't make him feel like he's on a boat. I can wear the orange-red one. No, that's the color of seafood. Then the cardinal red one. Yes. No… It's too "eminence" looking. Wait a minute. - Is this alright? - Yes, perfect. And what will you do with the other one? It reminds me of the sea too much, being far away. - I'd throw it away. - Yes, throw it away. Luisa. If Mohammad won't go to the mountain, the mountain must go to Mohamed. I should've come to bid you good night. - Forgive me. - You must forgive me. I neglected you for that endless game. Now we are together and can talk. Marco… You are the same woman that I once met. Still young, still beautiful. Marco, if you hadn't come home tonight, I'd have gone mad, wouldn't have slept. - Dear… - Listen to me, love. I was west, Di Blasio was south. The marquise plays a jack and I don't cover it with her king. I don't follow you. What are you talking about? Tonight's third round. - Must we talk about it now? - If I'm boring you, I'll leave. - No, go on. I'm interested. - Really? So, I was west… These Romans! Tommaso… - Virginia! - Tommaso. - Virginia! - Dear. - Virginia! - Honey… Virginia, you perturb me deep down inside. Tommaso, love! Hey! Are you turning your back on me? To avoid looking at you in that blue robe! - It's lovely, isn't it? - It's horrible! - What are you saying? - It's horrible! - It's terrible. Too gaudy. - Tommaso! - Take it off right now! - No! I said to take it off! - Don't cry. - I will not take it off! Don't cry. The driver, the cook and that idiot Pasquale will think we're arguing. - Isn't that what we're doing? - Be quiet! We're discussing good taste! - No. We're arguing! - Be quiet! You want me to lose the respect of my employees? They're surely eavesdropping, especially that idiot, Pasquale! You're overbearing! An overbearing coward! - I am a gentleman! - A butler! - A gentlemanly butler! - I won't take it off. I won't. That blue robe offends my sensitivity as an artist. Either the robe goes out, or I do. Out with the robe. - Alright. - But with me inside it. - Better! - I'm going back to Mom's. Watch out, because I'll leave. The suitcase is always ready, my dear. Here it is. Goodbye. Forever. - What's that? - It's English, silly! You are awful! You know I can't go to my mom's. I'm an orphan! I know. I couldn't risk having a mother-in-law. - So you're staying? - Yes. - I'm staying with the robe. - No. Be quiet. I'll even go to bed with it. I don't care what you say. Be quiet, please. Move the suitcase. It bothers me. Good thing you took off the robe. I am in command here! I'm fed up with you! I am a man with good taste! Be quiet, huh? If I could… Good morning. Hurry. Your grandfather is coming. Here! Hurry! We have a few seconds. - Here, Tommaso. - Get in the hammock. - There. Where did you go? - I'm here. Where? Here you are. Come here. The blanket. Here. Pretend you are sleeping. Here. Hurry! Wake up! How did you sleep there, sailor? Very well, Admiral. You have sweet dreams in that nest of young dolphins! - I'm pleased with you, sailor. - Thank you, sir. - Do some gymnastics now. - Right away, sir. - At 8:00, report to my office! - Of course, sir. My heart will always be close to you. My dad only landed yesterday. He wants me to be with him today. Let's see if you'll escape me tonight, too. Tonight? Excuse me. What did you say, Dad? Unfortunately, we can't be together tonight, either. Dad says we have a dinner invitation. What dinner? There's a party in your honor. Our mothers decided. I didn't know! Mom is still sleeping. So I'll see you at the party tonight. Of course I'll always dance with you. Who else? See you tonight, dear. You want a little kiss? I'll send it right away. Come on, come on! Happy? Kiss received. Over and out. Do you want to break up with Gigliola? I want to break up with the world! I am another man, in love with another woman! The Japanese girl? Love has no color, but it has a name. My love is called Liù. It's just a crush. I don't know. I'll tell you tonight when I see her again. - What about the party? - Who cares! I'll be late. I'm going to take a shower. - Saro, you want to take one first? - No. You take it first. It'll clear your thoughts. - Saro, call for breakfast. - Saro, always Saro! - Saro, toss my slippers to me! - Here! Go! The drill is over. Come here. Read the message I received. "From the admiral's ship to all units." "As of 12:24 a.m., radio silence must be observed." Turn the page. Turn the page, I said! And read. Read! "Special message." "Secret lunch in the kitchen today, just the two of us." Go on. "Rigatoni pasta with pajata." "Beans with pork rinds." - "What dessert do you prefer?" - Pudding. And you? - Chestnut cake! - Me too. What am I saying? Boatswain, you're taking advantage of my trust in you. I should've had you do manual labor! I'm abandoning the deck. Teach the sailor to smoke a pipe in the right way. You can smoke this in 20 years. What will Granddad say? Granddad, in 20 years? He will have forgotten. - Can't you eat after? - After what? We need to make breakfast. On an empty stomach? I should help you on an empty stomach? I can't even chew. - You're chewing. - Please! I don't chew. I nibble. - Just to get back my energy. - Sure… I'm the only one in this castle who works. "Do this, do that. Virginia here, Virginia there." I do everything! I have a castle on my shoulders. I have a kitchen, a whole kitchen! I don't have a husband who is a butler! Also because this butler didn't want you. Yes, Mr. Tommaso. Countess, good morning. - A cup of instant coffee. - Right away. Get moving. Why are you standing there? I have a question to ask you. Tommaso, listen carefully. I was west. South plays the jack. I don't cover it with his king. South plays a card. And she wins with a queen. I should look at the whole thing. - It's better to re-build the round. - Yes! Rolando, bring the green cloth. Rosa, you'll be the dummy. - Yes, the dummy. - I won't. - Come on, Rosa. - It scares me. - What does a dummy do? - Virginia, you too, come. - Please. - Thank you. - Instant coffee for the countess! - Countess… Rolando, the green cloth, hurry. - How scary. - You'll be the dummy. - I don't want to. - Be natural. So, Countess. I feel in my element this evening. There is an ocean of people. - Magnificent. - Yes. - They look very nice together. - They are made for each other. They've always gotten along, ever since they were children. Gianni is very much in love with Gigliola. When he gets back from his cruise, we'll announce the engagement. - Your usual, Commander. - Thank you. Remember, Tommaso? I was a cadet at the time. - Yes. It was the year… - Forget it. Cheers! - This is for… - Forget it. Cheers! Thank you, Commander. Cheers! - Let's go in the garden. - Why? To be alone a bit! Let's go! - You are… - What? Engaged? I don't have time to be in love. - Who is the cadet dancing with Alina? - Gianni's friend. - What would the baroness like? - Champagne, Tommaso. - Pasquale, champagne. - Right away. What manners! A glass. Please, Baroness. And excuse me. Thank you. It backfired. It happens with the rifle too. I'm not a sporty person. Follow me. Follow me… - Commander, do you like bridge? - To the point of having married it. Bridge is my wife. Come on! - Get up! - Excuse me. - Again! - Alright. Try again! - Put your weight on your legs! - Yes, sir. - Come on! - I made it! I made it! I… So I saw. I managed to see with only one eye. There are only eight days left and then you'll leave. I left many times, I returned many times. But this time you'll cross the sea. You'll see different people, meet other women. I can meet them here too. Are you thinking about your departure? Never as much as this time. When you are away You will have forgotten me And I will have lost you, I know But you won't be alone There will be many That will comfort you I will have no one because I still love you They will talk about easy loves And will make you believe That in love one should laugh And they will laugh at me You will laugh at me There will be many Who will comfort you I will have no one because I still love you What are they doing, instead of answering? Good. Is it coming or not… It came. I must take care of the rest. Aleardi, reporting! Yes. Right away, sailor. Here I am. Excuse me. What is it? - Any news? - A lot, sir. Good. Sit down and tell me what's up. Well? The mothers want to announce Gianni and Gigliola's engagement. We'll see. A flirt between my cousin Alina and Spampinato. In the garden, Gianni is dedicating a song to his girl. Wow! With your eyes in the Navy, you won't need binoculars. - I believe it, Granddad! - No Roman accent! Yes, Admiral! - Very good, Dad. - You always play wonderfully. No. I'm happy to play the piano sometimes, but life at sea has made me rusty. The sea has never made anyone rusty! Well, I say! - Who gave you that stuff? - Boatswain Tommaso. Go change right away. Yes, Admiral! Excuse me, Dad. Maurizio, come here. Come. You spoil him. Don't shoot the pianist, Pecos Bill! Gianni, why don't you sing that beautiful song? - Which one? - The one about the west. - Yes, "Deguello"! - Make him happy. - I like it, and so will Granddad. - You are spoiling him. The life of a man In your hands An enemy of who Hates as you do A best friend He should be but he isn't It would be best if he dies A gesture, and his end is here He'll fall But you know he will follow you The hatred in his heart Will live after his end When you live like that Life is no longer worth anything Someone will come To kill you And when you fall You will remember This man before you What does the life of a man Matter to you? But remember That when he falls The best part of you Will die If he doesn't become an admiral, he can become a good singer. No! He will become a magnificent naval officer! - Yes! - Admiral! Dad. What should I do now? Stand at attention, officer? - My son! - Dad! - I am proud of you, my son. - Not as proud as I am of my dad. - I heard great things about you. - I am one of the best students. Not one of the best, but the best. You're number one! - As you wish, Dad. - Number one. I don't want anything. I give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give to Saro what is my son's. You made it! - We made it. - No. I didn't do anything. You did it. You did everything. You study as you should. You're respected by everyone. When I landed in Naples, your aunt told me you were in Rome, a guest of a noble family, in a castle. So I thought… My son made it! I left and here I am! I called the castle. They wanted to know who I was. - I didn't want to say it. - Why? Times have changed, but nobles are nobles. - Go on! - It's easy for you to say go on! You are one of them now. You are an officer and I am a boatswain. I am not ashamed. I'm proud of it. Countess Aleardi says the real ship commander is the boatswain. Yes. She didn't tell a lie. Boatswains. What does the Countess Aleardi know about ships, sailors? Her husband commands a squad of torpedo boats. Wait. Aleardi was… No, it can't be. The Bengasi commander was a captain at the time… - It can't be. - Gianni's grandfather! - He is a reserve admiral. - Then it's him! It is him, his father! We called him "Dad". He loved us very much. He's a good person. He had me receive this World War II medal. - He'd be happy to see you again. - You think? - Yes. He plays at being an admiral. - He plays at it? Yes, with his grandson. He's always thinking of the sea. Yes. I'd like to see him again. - Then go see him. - No. Are you kidding? I should go without telling him first? For us, the admiral is like the Himalayan mountain top! - Try calling him. - That could be an idea. Yes, I'll phone! I want to hear his voice. I haven't heard it in a long time. Miss, please, give me 902654. - Here. You want to smoke? - No. Do so. Yes, I understand. Cigarettes are simple. They aren't sophisticated. Tobacco for sailors is like bread! Hello? Aleardi residence? Could I speak with the admiral? Spampinato. Yes, thank you. Good morning, Admiral. This is Spampinato. What do you want, young man? I am not Saro. I am his father, Boatswain Spampinato. I don't remember a Spampinato. I always called everyone by a nickname. True, Admiral. Yes, yes. You gave me one too. You called me "little sole". Little sole. Of course! Come to the castle immediately! That's an order! Yes, Admiral. - Are you coming with me? - No, Dad. I can't. I have an important appointment. - Write up these two points. - Right away, sir. You had ten. Plus two is 12. - How many do you have? - Sixteen, sir. - Sixteen… - All right. And… Great shot! And eight makes 24. - I'd like to withdraw my win. - Naturally. But you must admit that you were outrageously lucky! Very good, Tommaso. Tommasino! - You must not call me Tommasino. - Are you or not my husband? - I'm Mr. Tommaso on duty. - Alright, Mr. Tommaso. - What is it? - It's Boatswain Spampinato. - The admiral is waiting! Go, go. - Bye, love. Please, come. Boatswain Spampinato. - Come here! - Admiral! How are you? Here, on my chest! Old companion of past years. How's it going? Go away. - Go. - You haven't changed. Always in shape. Just like old times! You don't play around either. I must admit I don't feel the years. I could still command the entire fleet from my flagship. You look like a young man, still so thin. I do gymnastics every morning. "Mens sana in corpore sano." You should do it too. You've gained some weight. That has nothing to do with gymnastics. Macaroni is what ruins me. - I like pasta. - It's the ruin of Italians. From a little sole, I've become a big bass. Dear friend! We'll talk later about the good old days, just you and me. - You must tell me one thing. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Do you know how to play five-pins? Admiral, you don't know this, but I won three national tournaments and a European one. Perfect! In Ischia, my hometown, they call me "pin-eater". Alright! Then the three of us will have a nice game. - As you wish. - Our pin-eater boatswain… Spampinato. Spampinato and I against you. It's not possible. Are you afraid? Are you afraid of us? No, sir. The Italian game is individual or in couples. - You're right. - What do you propose? I would propose, as my companion… Me! Me. - Mr. Maurizio. - Yes, Admiral! Come here. I'll introduce you. My grandson, sailor Aleardi. - Boatswain, pin-eater… - Spampinato. - Saro's father? - Yes. - Pleased to meet you. - I'm pleased. - I am your son's good friend. - Thank you for this honor. My compliments for your grandson. It's like talking to a man. It's not right to play with a child who doesn't reach the table. - There's a platform, sir. - Did you hear that? My butler always finds a solution for everything. I'm sorry. I refuse. - Why? - I have to refuse. I can't. I'm a champion. I can't play with a child. It's not fair. Let's play! I want to teach my butler a lesson. He wins 3,000 liras a day from me. If that is so… Let's play. - Let's play. - I'll get things ready. Thank you. - Here's to you, sir. Please. - Thank you. The platform. Here. The usual 1,000 liras, sir? Five thousand. Or 5,000 for big occasions. Five thousand for big occasions! - We're playing for money with a child? - I want to clobber Tommaso. - Italian style without a rubber match. - Alright. - Let's count. - Alright. The youngest. Please, gentlemen. Four, eight, ten, eleven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. It's your turn, sir. - It doesn't matter. My shots are enough. - Let's hope so. Excuse me, gentlemen. Do you mind? Way to go, Tommaso! Eight points. Four balls, four pins, gentlemen. - Right. - I'll write it down. - Little sole, please. - Don't worry. - Eat up all those pins! - Don't worry, Admiral. I'll fix him. - Did you see that, Admiral? - Magnificent! - What a hit! - Four pins, ten balls, 14! Write that down, Tommaso. - Happy? - My savior. Write that down, Tommaso. - Sixteen and eight makes 24. - Game won, gentlemen. In two hits and with ten points more. Thank you, sir. Very kind of you. - To you, sir. - Thank you, Tommaso. Always at your disposal. Please. Pin-eater! What did you eat? I ate mine. You were left starving. - We'll do a return game later on. - Coupled with you? I don't think so! No, no, Gianni. - So courageous this morning and… - This morning was different. - She was away. - Now she is close! Saro! I'm embarrassed. - She must be sleeping. - Wake her. Come on! We'll become relatives, cousins! What are you doing, Gianni? The accordion Is playing for me tonight To remind you of a love Going back many years The accordion But don't cry It can't be cancelled like this Greater than ever My desire for you comes back When you lived happily with me If I close my eyes I see your face I see your smile again But faraway hands No longer clasp The accordion Is playing for us tonight Greater than ever My desire for you comes back The accordion plays for me It was night There was the moon I kissed your lips It was the last time You were leaving me Love Do you see? It went well. Trust Gianni! Let's go, cousin! I wouldn't know. If he promised, he'll surely call. My duties, Marquise. It was Miss Gigliola. I answered as you requested. I heard. Thank you. May I help you, sir? No, I don't think so. Actually… - Where would a Japanese girl study? - In Japan, sir. - I knew that. Here in Rome! - In Rome… - At the Oriental Institute. - Wonderful! You know everything. The more we know, the more we realize we don't know. - Ignorance is infinite. - Thank you, Tommaso. ORIENTAL INSTITUTE How's it going with the pipe? - Tommaso says that I smoke it well. - Good! - Do you cough? - Never. Very well! Now you'll learn how to drink whiskey. - It's as important as the pipe. - Yes, Granddad. - Excuse me! Yes, sir. - Come on. Drink! It's my first time. May I see how you drink it? Right, right. Watch closely. I sip it. See? Yes, sip. - Can I drink it in one gulp? - Yes, but it's not easy! I'll try. Son, what did you do? Come here! - How do you feel? - Very well, sir. Fantastic! You're the most Aleardi of them all. More than an admiral! The Queen of England will declare you lord of the seven seas! Come in! - How'd it go with the whiskey? - Fine. - You are a Jack of all trades! - You don't kid around either. Look who is in Rome! I never would've expected it. I want to take the two cadets there. It's a contact that could be helpful before the cruise. - Granddad, may I go? - Yes. Tell the two students to come to me. - Dear Prince! - Admiral. Dear Prince! How's it going? Your letter gave me great joy, that of seeing you again! The door to my humble home is open for you like a flower blooms in the sun, honorable admiral. Thank you. My grandson. A vigorous gem in the thousand-year dynasty from which you descend. A friend of my grandson, Spampinato. - Please. - Thank you. Friends of friends are the peaceful and calm waves of the same sea. The sea is everything for us. We are friends. Look. A pool… Very lovely. The house… - Please. - Thank you. Dear Prince. It's amazing! All identical, exactly like… Like my home in Yokohama. Yes. I built it like this on purpose. We live with sorrow, with nostalgia we die. From the corners of every home we can remove dust, chase away shadows, but not memories. After the delicate assignment… Please. …that the emperor entrusted me with, memories live here, in my little Japan, in the heart of your beautiful land. - Please. - Thank you. Incredible! Magnificent! Exactly the same! Identical! We spent our loveliest hours here, when your glorious ship was in distress, giving me the joy of having you as my guest. It was a mutual pleasure. Thank you. Your stay in my home was less bitter. My family. You'll remember Jen-Oha, my wife. Many years have gone by, Princess, but on my lips, with the salt of the seven seas, there is still the unmistakable sweet taste of your tea. It would have been bitter if your praise hadn't sweetened it. Our daughters. She is Sakya. She is Yen. She is Liù. Liù… The first two were little girls at the time. Liù was born after your departure. A flower that blossomed out of the ruins of the war. Speaking of flowers, remember my nursery? Did you move that here too? - No, because… - Come, please. Dear Prince! An extraordinary man. You don't care about the nursery? Yes, certainly. - Here it is. - Magnificent! Incredible! It's the same as the one in Yokohama! The orchids, beautiful! The same flowers! I bet that you take care of them. Certainly, as I've always done… Saro. - She is Liù. - I imagined that. - I must talk to her alone. - How? It's hard to get close to women here, like in the Middle Ages. Let's go, boys! Again, compliments, dear Prince. I didn't think it was possible. It takes me back. This is the place of prayer. We honor our great ancestors here. There, ourselves. When the circumstances of life don't allow us to keep our word… we cancel the dishonor with death. It is the law of the sea. The life of the commander is tied to the ship's life. Death is the sister of life. It is born with us and is always lovingly close to us, ready to rescue us in moments of need. - Please. - Thank you. It has the scent of all the flowers in the world. The generosity of your praise equals the poverty of my merits, honorable admiral. My honorable friend, Prince Hiro Toyo, had me learn about that wonderful country that will be the last stop of your cruise, Japan. It is not the Japan that they will see. As the storm tears the green leaves of a secular tree, the sad wind of collective folly destroys and contaminates our most wonderful customs and destroys noble and ancient traditions in Japan. Already in families they drink tea on uncomfortable rubber foam chairs. Despicable habit. There are girls who refuse our attire and costumes to wear horrible blue jeans and perform wild dances. Luckily, that wind of folly did not reach my home. My sweet wife worries about knowing if the spirit of the honorable guests is serene and free from cloudy and sad thoughts. Hospitality expects that you leave the house healthier than when you entered. I feel as healthy as a fish, and as happy as a seagull. Go ahead. I'd like to stay a few minutes with my honorable friend, Hiro Toyo. Saro, I must talk to her! - You are crazy! - Yes, you must help me. There must be a way to speak to her. Saro, help me! Maybe there is a way. Come, follow me. - Just do one thing. - Yes. Come here. Excuse me. That's it. Here. Thank you. Admiral! Gianni is sick! - What is it? - Gianni! Gianni! Son, what was it? Nothing serious. He just fainted. - Let's take him in the car. - No. Your grandson got ill here and here he must recover. - He's coming around. - What happened… You fainted. - Fainted. - Fainted… - How do you feel now? - Ill. He feels ill. Don't worry, go on. I'll cure him with medicines from my plants. Tomorrow he'll return home healthier than before. Thank you, my friend. Take care, Gianni. Prince. It must have been that strange thing they call tea. No, sir. It was what I gave him. - What? - A punch, sir. Why, Spampinato? To help him stay there. He wants to talk to Liù. He loves her. - Love at first sight? - He met her a few evenings ago. Love at first sight! An Aleardi characteristic. We hand it down from father to son. The girl is lovely. I don't mind her at all. She'll make him forget that unpleasant Gigliola. Filiberto, go home right now! Full speed ahead! This restoring mixture will soon make you sleep profoundly. When your eyes open tomorrow to the beauty of nature, your energy and vigor will return. Thank you, Prince. I wish for you to dream of beautiful things. Thanks again. What kind of Japanese pajamas are these? Liù! Love! I waited for you for so long. Why didn't you come? I couldn't, Gianni. I can't, and will never be able. But I love you with the heart of a 20-year-old. I don't want to lose you. I love you too, with the heart of my youth. My heart beats for the first time. But we'd better not see each other again. Why don't you want to see me again? How could I? They won't let me out. The canary managed to fly out of the cage once but when caught, cannot go back in the sky. I'll come to the garden at night. You won't be able to enter. I will. Promise that you will come. Yes, I'll come tomorrow, under the big willow. That herbal tea… Yes, I will be under the willow. The big willow. That herbal tea… I'll be under the willow. Love… Love. - Gianni. - Liù! Love. - A falling star! - Make a wish. I'd like my life to be one of your endless kisses. On the eternity of our love. Because your desire is also mine. I only expressed one. I'd like you to be a flower and me, a butterfly. You, the ocean, and me, a grain of sand. Me, your mouth, and you, my breathing. The stars in the sky wouldn't be enough to make my wishes come true. I am enough, Liù. Now leave me. Why? You must go. If you stay, our happiness is in danger. I will return tomorrow. No. It's too dangerous. Not here. I'll wait for you tomorrow at the lake garden, at 11:00 a.m. Promise that you'll come. Will you? I don't know what excuse to use. You must come. Promise me. Alright, I'll come. But go now. - Thank you, love. I'll be waiting. - Go, love. Think of me. I will dream of you. Very good! - How do you feel, sailor? - In my element, sir. - Good! - Again, sir? Sure! In the Pacific, storms last for weeks. Rough sea! Admiral… What've you got to do with storms in the Pacific? Enough! Go to my studio for a lesson on naval equipment. Here. You hold still! You ruined everything. - I ruined everything? - The water was for the boy. I didn't know. Rough sea… Hello. Hello. Say it. Say it. - Say it… - I should say it? Two words… It's not easy. For you it's easy to say, "Say it." But what can I say? I am a humble man of the sea, a boatswain. So what? Look at him. Duke, put yourself in my place! Yes, I'll put myself in your place. - Are you serious? - Of course. I always gladly put myself in other people's places. Excuse me, madam. Will you please lead the way? Excuse me. - Where are they going? - I wouldn't know. Maybe to talk about us, about the engagement. But we agree. - I don't understand your father. - Actually, I… Please. Come, boatswain. - Sit down. - Please. - Sit down. - Please, sit down. Let's get to the heart of the matter. Let's get to the heart, Mr. Spampinato. - I am here… - Say it. Come on! - Say it! - Don't worry, I'll say it. It's not so easy, boatswain. - You're talking to a duke! - I don't care about dukes! - Bravo, Dad! - No, I must say it. My husband is right. No, madam. I'm sorry. He isn't right. Also because now I'm your husband and I haven't spoken yet. - Then speak up and answer. - Of course I will speak. So… Say it. - Me? - Say it. So… I am here to ask you for my daughter's hand. Alright, for your daughter! Very good! I certainly am not biased regarding social classes. Of course not! I'm a duke with a crown on my head, and a head on my shoulders. I am a practical man. Practical. What can my son offer your daughter? A glorious uniform, a respectable social position. But let's speak clearly. The salary of a Navy officer we know is not much, and my son only has that. For Saro, I would give up anything. You are very kind, my child. But these are just words. Things that we do when we love someone. You are a gentleman, Mr. Spampinato. With this big act you wanted us to meditate, above all, our children. Thank you, Duke. Thank you, madam. What can I say? Be happy, kids. They will be happy. Then my assignment is over. This joke is over too. - I hope you didn't mind it. - Of course! - May I have my jacket back? - Of course. I would leave it, but… I can't. I can't, because I care for it. It's not a perfect cut or sewn by an important tailor. It even has a few flaws, but I like it. This was the goal of my entire life. It has flaws, but it is clean. Clean, without stains. - May you be as happy as you desire. - Thank you. It is lovely here. It reminds me of Japan, with its magnolias, willows, ducks! You didn't answer my question. You're hiding something. - What are you thinking? - No, Liù. Why have you changed since last night? You were afraid, but now you're happy, carefree. Why don't you answer? Last night we took things too seriously. We had forgotten that you are leaving and that we are too young to be tied down. - Let's just be friends. - Be friends? I love you and want to be tied to you forever. Maybe there is something, someone between us. Please don't ask questions. Let's walk. I want the memory of this day to be pleasant. We'll have thousands of days to remember. Of course, but many months will go by before you return. - Do you have a pen? - Here, miss. Here. What do you want to do? Watch out. They'll pop. Here. - What did you write? - I'll tell you. Liù and Gianni. United forever. It's already 2:00 p.m. Days like this should never end. But time goes relentlessly by like the water that moves that clock. A truly profound thought. Oriental wisdom. I remind you that it's time to eat. And I remind you that I must go home. First I have a surprise for you. He said you had called to order a complete meal. - Yes. - Thank you. But I said not to serve it. There is no time. I am already late. I ordered a simple tea. Poor me. I didn't remember that you don't like tea. I realized it when you came to my house with the admiral. I must get used to it… with a Japanese wife. Gianni, I… Here is our good tea. You will like it. I hope so. Women in Japan don't sit at the table with their men. What a marvelous sensation, being served and admired. I could stay here forever. Instead, I must hurry. It's late. This sea cannot separate us for very long. Because one day you will see me return. Don't forget me. Where have you been all this time? Who were you with? With Gianni Aleardi, at the lake garden. When will you see him again? - Tomorrow evening. - Where? In the garden under the big willow. The guest who enters my home through the door is welcomed. - I'd like… - I already know what you want to say! You must never come back! Liù loves me and I want to marry her. You can't refuse her hand. I'd be honored to welcome you into my family like a river welcomes another river, but I promised Liù in marriage 14 years ago, to Prince Katai. She was four at the time, a child. It's inadmissible! Liù loves me. You can't have her marry someone else without her consent! I'm the one who decides. I cannot go back on my word! But Liù… My word is hers. Please, Prince. Listen to me. It's late. We have nothing more to say to each other. A-7, B-7, G-7! Water. Where did you place your fleet? A simple sailor defends himself as best he can. Shoot! D-10… A-7. - You sunk my last two submarines. - Yes, sir. I will be generous and give you another three shots. F-4, F-5, F-6. You sank my flagship! I am not playing with you anymore! - Granddad, I'm not leaving anymore. - What? Sit down. Sit down! What is it? What is going on? - I don't want to leave. - Are you crazy? Maybe. I'm not even sure myself. I don't understand anything anymore! Tell me what's going on. There's a remedy to everything. Granddad, you must help me. What kind of man are you? Run! Face the situation. Talk to him, man to man, an Italian count to a Japanese prince! Their traditions are worth as much as ours, and love, since the days of Adam and Eve, doesn't give a darn about anything. - Granddad, I… - It's almost time to leave! Go! Yes, I'm going. - Did he argue with the Japanese girl? - It's none of your business. - Shall we play another battle? - I'm not playing with you anymore! No, Marquise. Mr. Gianni went to accompany the commander to the airport. Yes, he leaves tonight. I will tell him. My regards. - Did Gianni know I was leaving? - He's probably on his way. Give him my best wishes. - He'll be sorry he missed you. - Never as much as myself. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye, dear. I'll miss you. - But between rounds think of me. - I do nothing else! It's why I always lose. - Dad! - Don't forget. Study, be obedient and go right to sleep. Bring me a dolphin. I want to learn to ride one. Your son is becoming a pirate. - Take care of the pirate. - You can be proud of him. - Goodbye, Tommaso. - Have a good trip, sir. Thank you. Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad. Did you come to make me suffer more? No. Because I love you as you love me. Nothing can change our destiny. Not even your father. It would be dishonorable if he didn't keep his word. You were a child when he promised you to that man. Now you're a woman. You can't marry him if you don't love him. I can't marry you. We were dreaming, and now we're waking up. Dreams vanish and reality arrives. This home, my solitary life. The lute waiting for me to play it with my fingers. Your sea, your companions. Your ship waiting in the port for you. I am not leaving. You must do your duty! The sea will help you forget me. I wouldn't be here if I could. The thought of you marrying someone you don't love is killing me. I can't go. I won't leave. Please, leave. My life is destroyed. Why destroy yours? I'll go if you swear you'll wait for me. That you'll be faithful to our love and not marry that man. I swear it. I won't marry that man. Now I can leave. I'll leave with the memory of you in my hopeful heart. Goodbye, Liù. Goodbye, love. Goodbye… Love. - Are you satisfied? - Yes. She said she won't marry that man. It can't be. Your daughter would lie? Her lips were deceived by a heart in love. She knows she must marry Prince Katai. - I believe Liù. - Believe me. It's impossible! - Is my grandson back? - I was coming to tell you. He went up to the countess. I am worried about that boy. - You don't think he'll leave? - I don't. Here he is! I went to say bye to Mom. - How did it go? - I don't know. Did you talk to her? She promised not to marry him. But something escapes me. Everything will be alright. - Think of your career. Go. - Bye, Granddad. Bye. - Bye, big brother. - Bye, little brother. - Goodbye, Tommaso. - Have a good trip, sir. I am tired tonight. - Good night, Tommaso. - Good night, sir. - Maurizio, let's go to sleep. - Yes, Granddad. Liù! This weapon belongs to the past. My little Liù. Old shrubs, dry and corroded with time, disappear in the greenery of the new ones. It's the destiny of both plants and humans. Many centuries have gone by and I never noticed, Liù. - Where is the Andrea Doria? - There it is. Gianni! Liù! Wait for me! I will be back, forever! Yes, forever… Liù! When the sun will set Behind the mountains and hills In the silence of the evening You will remember me But if you call out my name You will see me returning Keeping you company Will be crowded thoughts And you will have silent lips If your heart doesn't speak But if you will call my name I will return From life I want to have Five things to remember The five things Are you You, you, you, you, you When the sun will set Behind the mountains and hills In the silence of the evening You will remember me If you call my name I will return From life I want to have Five things to remember The five things Are you You, you, you, you, you When the sun will set Behind mountains and hills In the silence of the evening You will remember me But if you call my name I will return To you When the sun will set Behind the mountains and hills In the silence of the evening You will remember me But if you call my name I will return To you THE END
