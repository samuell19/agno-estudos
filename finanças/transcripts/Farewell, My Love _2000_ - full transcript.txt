(dramatic music) (ominous music) (dog barking) (moaning) - Thank you. Well, goodbye. (gun firing) - How was it? - He wasn't my type. - There were supposed to be two. - Chino Sandoval himself will be delivering the other one in about 10 minutes. (ominous music) - [Chino] Hey, Tony! - [Weatherman] Spring showers this morning, followed by partial clearing this afternoon. (guns firing) It's currently 51. (gun fires) - [Brigit] The Karpov family left a long trail of death across two continents, finally settling here in the City of Angels, where they've continued their killing ways. Their time will soon be over. If my mother and father could see me now, I know they wouldn't be too pleased with the road I've taken to get here. I'm no longer the innocent little girl I was all those years ago. My parents and I often talked about visiting America one day, and I had always looked forward to a holiday together. I never imagined I'd end up coming alone. And with a job to do. (dramatic music) - It's a bit spartan. - All right. - There's a black car out back. Here. To a long life and quick death. (glasses clink) - Not bad. - I thought you'd like it. Okay, to business. For you. The best time would be late Saturday night. - Tomorrow? - Yes. At the club. They will all be there. Couriers make deliveries up until closing. Cash takes for the week from all Karpov business interests in the city. - Any of them legal? - A few. The club is straight. A business clientele. Now, this is Luc. Your backup. - I'm going in alone. It was agreed. - No, not alone. - I trust no one but you. - Then please trust me. He will be at the club tonight to answer any questions about the Karpovs or the club. He did all of the surveillance. My face is too famous in this town. Move fast. Don't hesitate. These bastards sniff out fear for a living. Well. Good evening.

And if I don't share your confidence in you and your skills, I assure you, we will have a very brief relationship. - Fair enough. Far wall, left of the stairs. It goes to the office. That's George. Big brother. He runs the club and most of the operations. His Pa, Sergei. Patriarch. He runs the business. He has a gift of investing illegitimate gains legitimately. And vice versa. - [Jimmy] Hey, Peter. Here you go. - Good evening. - Yes, it is. - I am Peter. May I buy you a drink? - No, thank you. I tend to get drunk when others buy my drinks. - He is too pretty, this boy. - His company suits me. Tonight, anyway. - And tomorrow night? - Anything special happening tomorrow night? - I will be here. - If I feel like going out and if I feel like coming here, if I feel like company, perhaps I'll look for you. - Don't take her money. Her drinks are on me. The boy's too. Nostrova. - And Natalya? - I've been here over an hour, I haven't seen her. She's probably in the office. I've been here every Saturday night for the last month. Sergei, George, Peter, and Natalya all cozy up in the office just before closing. Waiting for the couriers' last drop. It's perfect. There may be a bodyguard or a bouncer or two as well, but, no more. So, what's the plan? - Tonight we enjoy. And the drinks are free. - Well. (glasses clink) Here's to them paying. - Nostrovia. - [Luc] Cheers. - Hi. - [Brigit] Look at them all there, drunk arrogance. Oh, I am so looking forward to our time together tomorrow night. - What's your name? - Bogie. - (laughs) Gangster, huh? Well, you fit right in here. - And why do you say that? - Open your eyes, sport. (laughs) (glass crashing) - It's past your bedtime. (rock music) Tonight is a night of firsts and perhaps lasts.

But now good night. - Oh, you're booting me out? - We fucked, all right? Get past it. Tomorrow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, tomorrow. So, so does this mean you're confident in me now? - Well, I don't know how much help you'll be, but I'm fairly certain you won't get me killed. Renault assured me of your skills. I won't be holding your hand. - I'm not asking you to. - Yes, all right. If you're ready to kill? - I am. - And you're ready to die? - I am. - Then I'm confident in you. - I may even surprise you. - Then get some rest. You can find your way out.

Sure, you got it. - You're back. - Thirsty? - Alone this evening? - For now. - Perhaps a nightcap later at closing. - Can't say I'll still be here. - You will. - Will I? - [Peter] I fascinate you. - Hardly. - [Peter] I intrigue you. - Barely. - All right.

Sergei's asking for you. - [Jimmy] Let me top that off for you. - Does he always pour it on so heavy? - You've inspired him. I'd be careful if I were you. - I can take care of myself. - Yeah, I bet you can. - Thank you for coming to the Blue Parrot. This is our last number. We'll be back again next Thursday. - Last call. Last call for alcohol. (laughs) - Where do you live? - At home. - No, address. Watch your head. - 137 North. - 137 North Street. - Hey! - I'll meet you there. Let me go talk to my friend, all right? I promise I'll be right behind you. - I hope so. - Here you go. - Uh, Jimmy? Good night. - Aren't you gonna wait for him? - No. Tell him... Tell him that I left with somebody else. - He'll go nuts. - I hope so. - [Man] Hey, Jimmy. You ready to cash out? - Yeah. (upbeat music) Hey. Thanks a lot. (sighs) (ominous music) - [Man] See ya. (man grunts) (knocking) - Doorman? - Sleeping. (guns firing) (groaning) - All right, all right, calm down! Take the money! You? - You know her? - Shut it. - The others. Brother and father, where are they? - Speak. (car engine rumbling) - Shit. Where are they going? Are they coming back? - You have plenty of time to leave. Just take the money and go. Buy yourself something nice. - To be buried in. - Stop it. You're scaring me. - Do you know who we are? - Do you think I'd be here if I didn't? - Do we stay or do we go? - No, we stay until I hear what I want to hear. - Fuck you. - Not the magic word I was looking for. Now, Sergei and George Karpov, they will be returning when? Why is it so difficult for a woman to be taken seriously? (gasps) (smacks) - You're dead. You're very dead. My family will- - Will be joining you when? (dramatic music) - Shoot! (gun firing) - Sorry. Would you rather it were you? - No. - Then let's not get sentimental. We will not be fucked with, do you see that now? - I know who you are. - Do you? - Yes. The Reillys sent you. They didn't like our termination of the Sandovals, so they sent you. - The Reillys. The Reillys sent us. Well, perhaps. It's an ugly business, and you're pretty ugly. (Peter shouts) Surely you have other enemies. - Yes, but none with the muscle or the balls to do something stupid like this. - Are you certain of that? You all don't seem so intimidating to me. - Read my- - They were all supposed to be here. - They'll be back. Sergei likes to handle the money himself. They'll be back. It's always the same routine. (crickets chirping) - Ah, good. More fruit of the vine. Robe. - [Juli] There you go. - Thank you. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Shouldn't we have him answer it? - No. No answer will force them back all the sooner. Go watch the front doors. (sighs) (phone beeps) - You and all you Reilly bastards are going to pay for this. - And what would you say would be a fair price? - We will kill your whole fucking family. Exterminate the entire Reilly bloodline. - Hmm. An eye for an eye. Very Old Testament. I suppose that would be a fair trade. However, wouldn't you like to tell me if your father and brother will be returning together or separately? - Fuck you. - That's unlikely. (phone ringing) I bet it's for you. I'm sorry you won't get a chance to say goodbye. You're off to eternity. - My family. - I know what you mean. Oh, well. Adieu, mon amour. (gun fires) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Yes? - George, there's no answer at the club! - They better still be there. - Where are you? - I just made the pick-up. I'm on my way back. - I'll meet you. Bring the boys. I have to go to the club. Drink all you like, but keep yourselves ready for Papa. - Do you need us? - No, I'll be back. (upbeat music) - No!

We're expecting him any minute. - Another time. We must go. - Who are you? - Adieu, mon amour. (gasps) (slow music) (water running) Oh no. (groans) (crickets chirping) - [Michael] Is he going to live then? - Yes. It went clean through. He just needs rest, antibiotics, and a change of dressing twice a day. Antibiotics three times a day for 10 days. Painkillers as needed. And no alcohol with these. - Good night, Doc. - Boy, I sure am sorry to be trouble to you, Mr. Reilly. - No trouble. You did right to come here, Jimmy. - Well, I got out of there soon as I could. I told Sergei I could take care of myself. - Good, that's good. Now, tell me about the shooters. - Well, one was male, one was female. - Did you recognize them? - Guy's been in quite a bit lately, yeah. - And the woman? - Uh, just the last two nights. Didn't seem like they knew each other from before, but obviously. Somethin' about that girl, though. - [Michael] What? - She sure didn't seem like a killer. - They never do. (chuckles) - So, is it true? - It is. - Bastards deserved it. Nothin' but trouble since they weaseled into town. They get them all? - George, Peter, and Natalya. - Ah, a family tragedy. Boy, I'd love to have seen that. - Sergei's still alive. You can wager he thinks we done it. - Payback for hittin' the Sandovals? - Nah. They were insignificant sods. Sergei did the city a public service when he run them greasers out. This wasn't some little treat you were gonna surprise me with, was it? - Me, Dad? Love to take credit for it. But I gotta say no. - [Michael] Well, who would do us such a favor? - Don't know. - There was someone else there. - Who? - Renault. Renault showed up. He wasn't one of the hitters, but he was there. - Renault? Renault who? - Freelance fixer. Never a shooter. - Could he set up something like this? - Maybe, no. I mean, no one would go to him for something this important. He's good. He's thorough. But he's strictly small time. Hell, I've even used him myself. Never for wetwork, though. Maybe he was doin' some small side job for Sergei and walked in on the hit? - Find him. And put a couple of eyes on the Blue Parrot as well. James, does Sergei trust you? - I've been loyal to him for the last six months. Took a bullet for his family. Yeah, I think he trusts me all right. - Good. I want you to go to him tomorrow. See what he knows. Let me know when possibly we might finish the job somebody else started. Do you understand? - I understand. - Well, that's excellent. But be careful. Do you follow me? - Yes, sir. - Good night to you, James. (groaning) (dramatic music) (knocking) - Yes? - Renault. Bonjour. - Sava. - Breakfast delivery. Espresso and croissants. - [Brigit] Who's the third? - Luc. He's on the way. Hey, I haven't had a decent croissant since I left Paris. - What's the word on the street? - No word. And no one has any idea who did the job. - Not the whole job. - No. Not the whole job. - Well, when can I finish it? - After last night, Sergei certainly will be hard to get to. Ah, perhaps we wait. - No. - Give me one day then. Luc and I will do some snooping around to see what we can find out. - He shouldn't be showing his face. - Why not? No survivors, were there? - No. I don't think so. No, none. - Good. And your face certainly is not known in town. Maybe you should do a little sightseeing. - Not in the mood to play tourist. Besides, I didn't expect to be seeing anything today. - What? Why not? - I expected to be dead. - You weren't confident in your abilities? - It's just... It's not what I expected. I thought it would all be over. I'd be dead. No more worries. No more cares. - Don't speak like that. You're young. You feel too much. Tell me, how did Luc do? - Fine. - Just fine? - He was good. You were right to use him. - I knew he'd do well. Just like you. (knocking) The boy. Who is it? - [Luc] It's Bogie! - [Renault] Hey, hey. How are you? - How you doing? So, (claps) when are we gonna hit Sergei? - Look at him, all ready for business! - Well, he's alone in the club right now. - What? - I cruised by. Saw him go inside alone. Didn't see any of their thugs, no other cars. - Very strange. You two stay here. I'll check it out, call you from home. - Okay. It's good to see you. - Oh! - Are you all right? - No, it's all right. It's just a scratch. - Are you sure? - There's some breakfast for you if you'd like. - We make a good team, don't we? At work and play. - It was a one-time thing, you and me. - You saved my life. - And you saved mine. We're even. - We owe each other. It's a rule. We have to take care of each other forever or, or something. Isn't that how it goes? - Do you like life? - Of course. - Then find a new job. (ominous music) - Oh, shut up, and listen to me! I want every one of the Reilly operations watched. I want to know where Reilly is. I want to know where that Mick bastard's son is. I want those fucking potato eaters brought to me within an inch of their lives. Understand? - It wasn't the Reillys. - What? Yes, yes, sit. Speak. - What are you doing here all alone? You should have someone here- - I can take care of myself. Everyone is out after the Reillys. Now, speak. - Word on the street is, it wasn't the Reillys. - Bullshit. There is no such word on the street. The Reillys, they say we overstepped our boundaries. It was them. I can feel it. - It wasn't. - How do you know? - I have a friend, he helped me out with my shoulder. He says the Reillys are out looking for the shooter too. To thank him. Now, he assures me the Reillys have no idea who did it. - Impossible, how can this be? - I don't know. I mean, who, who else would have the balls to try something like that, huh? And why? - Good questions. But, if this is true, where to start? - Well, there's something else. - What, what else, what? Don't fuck with me. My family is dead. I have nothing left but hate. To kill you would be a welcome diversion. - I'm not sure, but when I was down, before I passed out, I think I saw Renault. - Renault? You are sure? - I'm pretty sure. He wasn't one of the shooters, but he was there. - It's a start. Find him, bring him here. Alive. (gun clicks) - Hey, check this out. Come on. Watch the movie with me. It'll help pass the time. I love these old flicks. - This is a good one. Everyone's a bad guy. Except the bimbo. She's gonna get them all killed. - Well, thanks for ruining the ending. - Well, they all end the same way. - James. How you flying there on one wing? - Oh, I'm fine, Mr. Reilly. Thanks for asking. - So then, what's the news? - Sergei's out sweeping the city. He's still not convinced it wasn't you. (laughs) - Well, is he covered? - No, not really. He sent me out to look for Renault. - No need. - Why not? - You must've made good time from the club. You beat 'em here. Into the kitchen with you. - Yes, sir. (slow music) - Here. - Thanks. - Renault is your name? - Yes. - Do you know where you are? - I would make an educated guess I am in the presence of Mr. Michael Reilly. - Indeed you are. Have we met? - A few years ago. You wouldn't remember me. It was a party at your home. - Aha. Well, you're right, I don't remember you. - Michael Jr., are you here? - I am. Do you know why you're here, Renault? - I don't have a clue. - We're looking for information. - Well, I will gladly be of help if I can. You know that. - Perhaps. Who contracted the hit on the Karpovs? - I don't know. No one does. Many think you did it. - Do you believe that? - I don't know. - We didn't do it. But you know who did. - Me? No. How could I know? - You were there. (smacks) Do you recognize him? - Bartender. - At the Blue Parrot. He was there. He says you were there. - No. - Who contracted the hit? (smacks) Is another family thinking about moving into town? (smacks) Are we targets? - Don't know. Sergei probably coming for you. - Whatever you're getting can't be worth this. We know you're talented, and we know you're loyal. With you on our team, we could send the whole Karpov organization to hell. And anyone else who tried to muscle in. You're on the payroll. Full time. What do you say? (mumbling) Anyhow, that's disappointing. (smacks) - Have we gone through his place yet? - Sean's over there now. - Paddy, go help him. (phone ringing) - He would've called by now. - Be patient. - I'm gonna go look for him. - Well, stay away from the club. - I'll try his place. Then I'll just drive by the club. Discreetly. Okay? You'll be here? - I'll be here. - Good. Just keep an eye on the place. If he leaves, I want to know. Karpov's still at the club. - He say anything else? - Nope. He's done talking. Sorry, Dad. We were too much for him. - Last week, he rented a loft for someone. Month to month. Near the Blue Parrot. - Go then! - Sean, stay here. (dramatic music) - [Paddy] Don't. - Wanna go for a ride, sweetheart? - Why not? Will I be coming back? - Now, that's up to you. - Mind if I bring a few things? - Now, James, go back in the kitchen. So you're the shooter be damned. - Shooter? What do you mean, shooter? - I've no patience for games. Now, get that off her face. My name is Michael Reilly. - I've heard of you. - And here's Michael Jr. - We've met. - And you are? - Brigit. - You're too young for this line of work, Brigit. Brigit who? - Does it matter? - No. You hit the Karpovs. - Yes. - That was quick. - Well, I have no reason to lie. I thought I probably wouldn't even be alive today. So at this point, every minute is an unforeseen bonus. - Who paid you to kill the Karpovs? - They're not all dead yet. - Allow me to rephrase. After you've killed Sergei, who will pay you for having killed the Karpovs? - Must one always kill for money? I mean, whatever happened to passion? - Ah, the first hurdle. It's to be a dance then. (thumping) Paddy, get him out of the pantry. Did some relative or friend of the Sandovals contact you? - No. - Then the next logical assumption is another family is moving in on the Karpovs' businesses. Is that it? - Not to my knowledge. It'll be all yours when I'm finished. - [Michael] And nobody's paying you? - No one. - She's just doing it out of the goodness of her heart. - Goodness has nothing to do with this. - Why then are you doing it? - Well, if you're not harmed or implicated, and you benefit from the result, my reason should be of no concern to you. - You see, that's where you're quite mistaken. We live in a world of information. Information can have great value. Barter currency, as it were. I like information. I like knowing things. I like knowing what's going on inside of my city and why. Do you get that? - That's all quite fascinating. But my reason is my own. It's personal, all right? Now, just let me go, and I'll finish what I started, and I'll be on my way. You'll never see me again. - Not good enough. You've gotta tell me what I'm asking if you want to live. If you don't, you won't. (Brigit gasps) Do you know him? - Yes. - He hired you? - I already told you, no one hired me. - He helped you? - Yes. - Tell me. Please, Brigit? - I'll tell you. All of it. But just to you and your son. You understand? Just to the two of you. - Paddy, you, Jimmy, and Sean go have a pint. Play some darts. Go down to the pub. - [Paddy] Yes, Mr. Reilly. - I was born in Paris, and I grew up in the Pyrenees. - [Michael] You're French? (speaking in foreign language) - Well, my mother was English, and my father was French, so (speaking in foreign language). - All right. Go on. - There was just my mother, my father, and me. We had land. A small vineyard. It was a simple, happy life. My father was tending to the land, and my mother and I were in the house. (speaking in foreign language) - We're celebrating Papa's first sale of our inaugural vintage. - You mean he actually sold? - Be nice. Look, if you work hard, one day you'll be able to take over the family business. - I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going to be a singer. - Oh! (upbeat music) - We heard a car coming. To me, they all looked happy, they were laughing. I looked at my mother, and she was worried. She could see that they were drunk. They had run out of liquor, beer. (gasps) My father didn't have a gun. (dramatic music) - Oh my god! - They shot him just like that. For no reason. (screaming) (man laughing) (gasping) (screaming) (gasps) Well, I did what I could. Nothing. George was first. (gasping) (speaking in foreign language) Then Natalya. Sergei was next. And then Peter took his turn. - Never heard of it. - They weren't finished. (speaking in foreign language) (gun fires) They left me for dead. (slow music) Our neighbor, Renault, heard the shots, but he came too late. Renault tended to my wounds, and most of them healed quickly. He was moving to America, so he sold the vineyard and some of my family's land for me, and put me in boarding school in Northern England. - That is a sad tale, to be sure. However, it could be just that. A tale. - Well, believe me or kill me right now. But promise me you will finish off Sergei. - I don't understand. I mean, what were the Karpovs even doing there? - It took me years to find that out. It was before the Wall fell. Apparently, Sergei and George were small-time hoods behind the Curtain up in the Baltics. Their name was Korchev then. They ended up in jail, and Peter and Natalya broke them out. They escaped to the West. Drank and robbed their way around the Continent for a while. I found out mine wasn't the only family they visited. They were on a drinking, killing binge, celebrating their freedom, if you will. They killed my mother and father for no reason. For no good reason at all. Interpol got onto their trail, but they got away. To America, the land of opportunity. Changed their name and went into business. - And Renault? - I was trying to trace them here in the States. I sold the last of my family's land, and I hired Renault. - You hired Renault? - I hired Renault. To track down the Karpovs. And he found them. Did he tell you where? - He told us nothing. He never gave you up, in case you were wondering. Continue. - While at university, I trained for this one job. I developed the skills I thought I'd need. Research, computers, fitness, weapons. I worked a few odd jobs that could get me access to international records. Then the time had come. My hate kept me going. I was ready. - Why didn't you just come to me at the start? Surely you must've known we'd be open to helping you. - It had to be personal. - You've proved yourself quite talented at the game. You're gifted. How do you fancy a job working for me? It can be a lucrative business. - Well, I'll think about it. Now, please, let me go. Let me finish it. (door bangs) - Whoa, whoa, hey. You all right? - My family's dead, you idiot. - What would it be worth to you if I knew where the main shooter was holed up? - Your life. - Mr. Karpov, a man's gotta know his worth, huh? How much? - All of it. Tell me. Do you know where the shooter is? - Yeah, I think so. - How? - The Reillys found her. - Her? Her, a fucking woman? - [Jimmy] Yep. - Fuck me. - The Reillys picked her up, but then they let her go. - So she could finish the job. - [Jimmy] Exactly. - Find out who hired her? - I don't know. My source was sent away while the Reillys questioned her. But he waited outside down the street, saw her when she came out. Michael Jr. put her in a cab and sent her home. The Reillys didn't even tail her. - So, where is she? - Well, I tipped back a few beers with my friend, and he gave me the address where she's staying. - [Sergei] Let's go. - Wait, wait, wait. Not yet. - What? - Why don't you let me make you a little coffee first? You're gonna want to be sharp, huh? - All right. - [Luc] Where were you? - I... - [Luc] Are you all right? - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Have you seen my dad? - Your dad? - [Luc] My dad. - Renault? - [Luc] Yes. - Is your father? - Yes. My mom raised me in London. I came out here a couple of years ago. I thought you knew. - No, I didn't know. - So, what, where is he? - The Reillys, they picked me up. - Well, how'd they find you? - Well, I don't know. But they caught Renault. Luc, they interrogated him. He was dead by the time I got there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (crying) - No, no! Father! Dammit! (crying) Did he say anything? - No, they said he didn't tell them a thing. - The stubborn bastard. - He was a good man. He took care of me. - He knew how to live. Full of life every minute. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - MJ. - This is Paddy. You were right. Jimmy's playing both sides. He gave me the slip at the pub, but I just found him at the Blue Parrot. - Go on. - He's with Karpov. They're pulling away. - They're going after the girl. - If they catch up with that sweet piece of action, I want front row seats. - I'd like to be there too, to see Sergei go down. Paddy, follow 'em. Wait for us outside her place. - Yes, sir. - [Luc] So what's the plan? - I have to find a new place. I can't have the Reillys or anyone knowing where I am. - Stay with me. - No. They found Renault. They found me. They will find you. We've both got to move. - Okay. Well, when we're done here, I'll pick up my stuff and we'll find a place together. - I don't think so. - Well, why not? - I said no. - We make a great team. - I can't think past tomorrow. It would be safer if we split up. - But we still have a job to finish. - I know! I know. There's only one target left. I will take him alone. - No. No, there is more than one target. (dramatic music) - How do you want to handle this? - I'll handle it. Very slowly, very painfully, she will die. - Where do you want us? - Stay here. I do not want to be disturbed. - You got it. - One last stop. (slow music) - Jimmy and Karpov just went in. There's two in the courtyard. (dramatic music) - [Sergei] Hello, young lady. - Hello, Jimmy. - Not what I expected. You can't be. - Maybe I'm not. - Oh no. It's her all right, Sergei. Trust me. - That's a good one. - I was expecting someone a bit more impressive. - I'll try harder next time. (whistling) (guns firing) - One question. And then? Now sit down. Now you will tell me who and why. - But that's two questions. (smacks) (laughs) - Now you answer! Who and why? - Well, my question is, who is your boy Jimmy really working for? And why? - Shut up! (gasps) (guns firing) (grunts) - Bravo. Bravo, very impressive. - You. It was you all along! - Ah. 'Fraid not, Sergei. Wish it was. But it was her. On her own. She wanted you all to herself. Said it was personal. - It's been a long time. - Why? - Ever heard of this vineyard? Faure Vineyards? A fine burgundy. My name is Brigit Faure. And this is the last bottle of a once-promising vineyard. My family's vineyard. (glass smashing) (groaning) You murdered my family. I executed yours. (speaking in foreign language) Remember? Remember? - The child? - Adieu, mon amour. (screams) (gun fires) - Well done. Do you have peace now? - Almost. Luc. These are the Reillys. Reillys, meet Luc. My partner. - If you'd like a job, I can use a man of your talents as well. - Oh, Mr. Reilly. I don't think Luc's your man. You see, you killed his father today. Monsieur Renault. (guns firing) Come on. Come on. (gun fires) Come on! (gentle music) Farewell, my loves. (kisses) - What are you gonna do now? Come on.
