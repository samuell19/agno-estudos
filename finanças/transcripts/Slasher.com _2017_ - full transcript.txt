Stop, please. The Springfield Chief of Police Greg Barns announced this morning that the FBI is investigating the murder of Hannan Williams as a possible thirteenth victim of the Slasher serial killer. It appears that the Slasher uses a Tor Onion Proxy to hide his IP address. Williams's body was discovered in her apartment Monday night after friends reported her disappearance to local authorities. And at times, they'll used a third party VPN software to create his own IP addresses. Now these IP addresses are associated with physical addresses within the area that the murders have occurred. Go. Get down, down, down, down, down! Down, down, down! What the hell! What the hell! Oh my good. Put your hands up! Hands in the air! Don't fucking move! Don't move! Shut up! Oh my God. People in danger of actually being falsely arrested for this murder? The ah, only danger at this time, well, you know I better not comment on that right now. Saturday evening Williams told friends she was meeting a man named Tyler Adler, whom she had met through an online dating website. Adler is one of several aliases the Slasher has used on various dating sites. I have no comment on new leads. But I can promise you this. We are following up on every one of them. We will find him. Look, until this Slasher is caught, we highly recommend nobody online dates. Hey, some people just have a hard time meeting people. That's about all I'm going to say about that. No. I have no comment on how he does that. Oh, we have five failed searches. Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze! Okay, move, move, move, move, move, move! Fuck! Move, move, move! Get down right now! Don't shoot! Fuck! Fuck! No! Take that thing off! The photo in Adler's profile has been identified as an Austin, Texas man and he is not considered to be a suspect in Williams's death. Internet records reveal Williams and Adler had not meet prior to Saturday but they have been communication online for a few weeks. The FBI was called into the investigation when forensics reported William's injuries were consistent with those of the previous victims of the Slasher. The last murder was one month ago in St. Louis and authorities believe the killer is still in Missouri. Women should exercise extreme caution when using internet dating sites. Kristy right? Jack. It's so good to finally meet you in person. Yeah. Come on in. Thanks. Um, picture? Sure. Not bad. I like your belt buckle. Oh Thanks. I've had it for years. You know you weren't kidding about living the meager lifestyle. Um, it's clean I guess. Yeah. I just don't know what to do with the space so I keep it plain. Keeps things simple though. How was your drive? Oh, it was fine, I make the drive between here and St. Louis all the time. For work? Family mostly. You know, you look different from the pictures you have online. Yeah, I guess I need to update them. No, it's fine. I'm pleasantly surprised. Most of the time with these things, it's the opposite. Wow, thanks. Yeah I've been trying to take better care of myself. Plus, I don't take very good photos. You look great though, just like your photos. Oh really? Which ones? Well, all of them. Wow, you are good. What happened to the smooth talker I've been chatting with these past few weeks? I guess I'm just a bit nervous. This is a crazy idea. Why? Do you think I'm the Slasher or something? Lighten up. I was just joking with you. Besides, you're not a girl. This just turned weird. Come on. It's an adventure. Our first real date is a weekend trip to a cabin. No menu to hide behind, nature, fresh air. It's a great way to get to know someone. You can back out if you want. I mean, I can cancel our reservation. But, it would make a pretty bad first impression. No, I think it sounds great. An adventure, right? Yeah. An adventure. You know you talk just like you do when we chat. You know, you don't. Sorry. I'm just nervous. Nervous, right. You really need some better pictures. ♫ I saw the World Wars coming ♫ Lost my wine along the way ♫ I pitch a tent... It's weird meeting face to face isn't it? Do you always take guys you just met out to the middle of nowhere? No, usually we just go to a dinner or a movie or something. Really? You don't strike me as the dinner and a movie type? Maybe that's why the guys I date don't stick around very long. So where'd you get this idea from? I mean I like it and all. Well my mom showed me an article about crazy first dates and I wanted to try one. So this is what I came up with. Aren't you afraid it could go badly? We chatted enough for me to feel good about you. Besides, if things didn't check out by my standards at your apartment, I was going to bail. Like what? You really want to know? Kind of. Okay. If you looked worse than your pictures. That turned out to be the opposite. If you really didn't have a car. It turns out you have a nice car. If your apartment was different than you described. Turned out to be pretty much like you said. Plus, you weren't forceful at all. In fact you seem kind of scared. Wow. You were evaluating me that much? Were? Who said I've stopped? And, uh, how am I doing? Not so bad, there's still critical data I'll need to collect before giving you the full assessment though. And what is that? Are you sure this is the place? Pretty sure. Shouldn't there be a big sign or something? I don't know? I'll call just to make sure this is the place. I don't have a signal here. Me neither. I guess that's just part of the fun though. Right? So you have been around here right? Yeah. I love this nature stuff. I thought I told you that? You did, I just didn't realize you meant this. I try to do as many outdoor vacations during the summer as possible. I come to this area a lot. Hiking, camping, floating, cabins. I never stayed here though. Well, shall we? It's an adventure. Man it's hot. Good old Missouri summers, hot and sticky. I hope the bugs aren't that bad. Man, you are a city boy. Sorry. It's beautiful though. You're beautiful. I think that you're beautiful. Smooth. Jesus. There's the sign. Looks like we made it. Should we just go in? Come on. Hello? Hello? Hi. Come on in. Hi. Oh you must be Kristy, and you must be Jack. What an attractive couple you two are. How are you two? We're fine, thanks. I was just cooking something and I just thought It smells very good. Yeah. Thank you hun. That's a nice spoon. Yes it is. It's been in my family for generations. It's sterling silver. Heavy. That's probably why I'm such a good cook. Is the reservation in your name? You'll have to forgive my appearance. I have been making lunch all day and cleaning down stairs. You have a basement here? We don't have basements, we have a rumpus room where we like to play games and have fun. And everyone around here calls me Momma. You can call me Momma. Thanks, Momma. So, I see that we have you in, we have you in cabin C. You booked that online I see? Yup. Very nice. Don't let those machetes dirty my house. Easy now, woman! Men. This is my husband, Jesse. Nice to meet you two. Nice to meet you too, sir. And this is my daughter Caitlin, who has blue hair. Hell of a place around here. Thank ya. Me and little Caitlin were just thrashing down some weeds around the property. You gotta keep beating mother nature back or she'll take over everything. Must be hot out there, huh? It's the perfect day to get naked. That's gross Momma. It's not gross, it's being human. What about you city girl? What do you think? I'm sorry? Do you like to get all naked up in the big city? Caitlin, I think you need to be quiet. It's alright. I'm from St. Louis. It's not really a big city like Chicago or New York. Yeah, I know where you are from. Caitlin! You hush now. Yes daddy. Oh these kids these days. You know, they're so curious. When we heard that you were coming all the way from St. Louis, Caitlin just kept on talking about you. Isn't that right, Caitlin? Yes Momma. Yeah, so, are we good to go? You need to sign just in case something happens to you. A little rental agreement that assures Myer's Rentals are not responsible for anything that happens to you or doesn't happen to you. Just right there. Sorry. We just have crayons. Oh, it's alright. There. Yes, there. You know we have a DVD collection because we don't have any internet, and it's right over there. And maybe you'd like to go see that if you are not busy tonight. I'll go have a look. Jesse, why don't you take this fine young man down to the cabin and show him where it is. Yes ma'am. Come on son. Are you alright in here? I'm fine. I'll find us something in case we get bored. We're heading in my truck. You're pretty near there as it is. You see that road? Yeah. Well sir, you take it south till you come to a fork in the road. You follow the left fork. A few hundred yards down the road, you're gonna come to a crossroads. Now you make a left. And your cabin, well it's going to be right about there. You can't miss it. It's the only one around. You got all that? Yes sir, I believe I do. Yes sir. What's it like to live in the city? Well it's busy. Way more traffic than here. What movies you recommend? I really need to get out of here. I'm not a little girl anymore like they treat me. I'm not sure what to tell you. Do you think I'm old enough to leave? That's enough right now honey. You best be getting back to your boyfriend. Yeah, I'll see you later. Nothing good? Guess we'll have to find other ways to entertain ourselves. Sounds good to me. Y'all know where you're going? Yes sir. You've been very helpful. You young folks have you a good time tonight. We'll be seeing more of you. Thanks. Straight up crazy. Straight up crazy. He drew a map on the hood of his car in the dust with his spit. Eww. Not a bad looking place. Quiet. It's peaceful. I love the country. You got the keys right? It's jammed. Pull the string muscles. Wow, this is a lot nicer than I thought it would be. What did you expect? Dirt floors or something? Well, kind of I guess. I'm going to go get the groceries. I'm ready for a beer. Now you are talking. Whatcha doing? Looking at these pictures. They're kind of weird. Why are they weird? I don't know. Who do you think these people are? I don't know. Satisfied customers? I've been wanting to do that for awhile. Our first kiss. It's nice. Exciting. Yeah, it's real exciting. ♫ To see a man slowly ♫ Take his own life ♫ And watch it wash away ♫ In oceans of fear ♫ Said I had a name for himself ♫ As he lies, I cry ♫ And a world of self loathing and tears Did you know this was here? I had no idea. It's nice. Too bad we don't have any suits. Who needs suits? What are you doing? Are you serious? Yeah. Why not? Okay, wow. I, That's nice. I mean good job. Good job? Seriously? Take off your clothes. Okay. Fine. Let's do this. We're doing this. I gotta say, as far as first dates go, this has been pretty great. It has. I'm really glad we did this. Me too. Our crazy first date. You're so beautiful. You're shaking. Hello? What the hell? I don't know. Are you two up? I can always come back if this is a bad time. Just give me a second. Hold on. God you are beautiful. Oh no. Morning breath. I like it. Good morning! I hope I didn't wake you. No, you're fine. We were just laying around. Good. Because I made you a breakfast casserole. It's kind of like a Myer's version of a B and B. Wow. That's really nice ma'am. I told you, you can just call me Momma. Right. Sorry Momma, I... It's good right? Eggs, potatoes, onions and parsley. Hi. Hi. It looks amazing. Good. All the ingredients are local. I grew the onion and parsley in my own garden. I hope you like it. It's really good. And you left this phone at my house yesterday. I didn't even notice it was gone. Thank you. Well just holler if you need anything. Thank you. Oh my God, it's good. Yeah? Oh yeah. This really your first time being out in nature? You got me. This is probably the most time I've spent outdoors. You're so cute. How do you like it? I'm getting used to it. You can't tell me you're not having fun. Can you? I'm having the best time. What's that? What? That. Are those cans? There's a lot of campers around here, you know? Maybe they just left their junk or something. Should we pick them up? You really don't get these people do you? What do you mean? People are different out here. Some just leave their junk behind. That seems wrong. Rednecks do redneck things. Don't judge. Looks like we walked to the main road. This is the road we can in on? Yeah. Not much of a road. Come on. So, what do we do now? Hiking isn't good enough for you? It's good. It's quiet and peaceful. This place seems to be miles from anything. What's that noise? Let's go check it out. Hey you two. It's Caitlin right? Yeah. How are you? Oh, I'm just playing while daddy does some work. How are you folks today? Doing alright? We are, thanks. Your wife made us the best breakfast casserole this morning. Yeah boy, that is one of her finest meals. You like her fried catfish too. You're going after that stuff pretty hard, huh? Got to, darlin'. You got to keep beating mother nature back or else that bitch will take over everything. Gotta beat mother nature back. So are we missing any sights on the property? Well we got us a lake. About a mile down that-a-way. You all been there yet? We had a great swim there yesterday. Maybe we'll go back today. We're also looking for a grocery store, some place we can restock on a few things. There's a general store about five mile up the road past the house. Six more miles, you come to town. They got some real good Bar-B-Que down at Petey's Smokehouse. Might go check the general store. Jack, what you thinking? What? Sorry. You wanna check out the general story or the town? Yeah, the store. We can get more beer for tonight. Great, thanks. We'll let you get back to work. Bye you two. Yeah, see you later. Did that seem weird to you? What? No. They're nice people. I think Caitlin was flirting with me. I think. What? Why is that funny? Well that's the first difference I've found with your profile. You were so humble online. Get you out in the woods and you think everyone wants you? No, it's not like that, I, never mind. I know you fancy him. I saw what you was doing. I'm sorry daddy. Little girls shouldn't act that way. Yes daddy. Who are you Caitlin? Daddy's little girl. That is right sweetheart. You're daddy's little girl. And only daddy's little girl. You stay away from them two. Hear? Yes daddy. That's my girl. Now you go play with your doll babies, I still got me some work to do. This place is old fashioned. It's rustic and cute. If you say so. I'm sure that they have the beer you want. At the very least, the beer you need. Hey guys, what's up? How's it going? Looks like you've been doing some serious hiking. Yeah, I'm on a two week hike through the Ozarks. Two weeks? Yeah man, I love this stuff man. Nature, wildlife. Wildlife? Don't you ever get nervous? Aww, no man. The animals they're all pretty calm. Keep to themselves for the most part. It's the people you got to worry about. More than wolves and bears? I'm just saying, you know? I hike through private property every so often. There're some crazies out there, I'll tell you what. Hell one time I even got shot at hiking down through Arkansas. I told the local sheriff afterword and he says "A man's got a right to defend what's his." Haven't had any problems up here though. As long as I leave the place like I found it. All the other hikers I've talked to though say pretty much the same thing. It's the people you better watch out for more so than the than the animals. Sounds like an adventure? Yeah. It's the only way to live. Maybe we'll see you later. Yeah. You guys take care and watch out for those mosquitoes. You too man. Afternoon. Good afternoon. Looks like they have a bit of everything. Yes they do. I'm gonna go grab some beer. So, you from out of town? Yeah. I'm from St. Louis. Oh, what brings you to these parts? We're staying at a cabin around here for the weekend. Oh neat. Which place? The Myer's. Momma's place. That's the one. Afternoon Jimmy. Howdy folks. Afternoon Sheriff. This couple's staying at Momma's place. The Myer's place eh? Yup. That's the one. First night? Second. Ah, where are my manners? Tom Westin, the Sheriff of these parts. Hi Sheriff, I'm Kristy Smith. Jack Roper. Pleasure. They're from St. Louis. St. Louis? Welp that's a great city. Love the pork steaks there. Lots of fatty goodness. Do you want anything else? I'm fine, thanks. What do I owe you? That brand's $7.34. Six beers. I guess you guys didn't come here to party too hard, now did you? Nope. Just the right amount. Course with a pretty thing like yourself, a man wouldn't need much to drink then, would he? Yeah, well, it was great meeting you Sheriff. But a guy like you in a town like this probably has a lot to do so we should get out of your hair. And y'all don't hesitate to give me a call if you need something. Sure thing. Don't you kids go having too much fun out there. Yeah, we'll try not to. Well Jimmy, what's the weather report looking like today? It's going to be a hot one sheriff. Lot of humidity. Just like this hell hole city we live in. Hot and slimy. Say Sheriff, did you see that thing on television last night about the Amish? You all don't hesitate to call me if you need anything now. I've had a really great time with you. This was a great idea. I'm kind of sad it has to end. Me too. Maybe we can come back for our second date? Yeah, you want a second date with me? I do, if you want one. If I want one? I think I do. Hello. It's Momma. I'm coming Momma. Hi guys. I just brought you a little nightcap. Wow. Thanks Momma. That's really kind of you. Oh, yours looks a little wilted. I can fix that. Yes, it's perfect. Thanks. By the way, your casserole was great. I'm so glad you liked it. It was delicious. Well good. So what is this? Oh, it's nothing special. It's just our little version of a Mint Julep. Wow. Mmm. It's really good. I'll let you folks get back to your night. Have a good one. - Good night. - Good night Momma. Please let me go. Please let me go. Please let me go. Please just let me go. Please. Why are you doing this to me? Please let me go. Please. No, please let me go. No! Please just get away from me. Get away. Get away from me! No. no. Please let me go. Please. Please just let me go. Please. Please. Please let me go, please? Please let me go. Please? Why are you doing this? Please. Please let me go. Quiet. Please. I know you're good people. Please. When I tell you to talk, you talk. When I tell you not to talk, you don't talk. Shut this girl up Jesse. Shut her up good. - Please. - Yes Momma. Please just let me go. Please. No! No, please! What are you doing? Well look who's up? It's our little city boy. Stop that. She can't breath. She can breath. Can't you? What's going on? Oh, would you like a gag too? I can give you a gag. Jesse, feed this to our city boy. I won't talk. I swear. Please no. No. Don't. No. No. Oh no. No! Anything else Momma? Maybe. Do we have any more use for that plaything over there? Yup, I think we've pretty much worn him out. I think he's all broken down down here. Ooh, this doesn't work. I think he needs to sleep. Yes Momma. I'll put him to sleep. Go to sleep, my little boy. Oh go to sleep, my little boy. Go to sleep. Jesse, get his gag. No. Feed the little boy. Feed the little boy. Feed the little boy. Ooh, feed the little boy. Feed the little boy. Feed the little boy. I love you, Jesse. I love you too, baby. Go get the room ready. Yes Momma. A strong body. You ever been with another man before? My precious little girl. My pretty, precious, little girl. Have you ever been touched like this before by another woman? Do you like it? Oh come on. We're just playing games. That's all we do here at the cabin. We just play games. I'm not gonna kill you. Jesse, please come on in here. Aw, come on now, we's just playing with all ya'll. I'm gonna let you go. You can have a nice vacation after all. Well look at that. She wants to stay after all. It looks like she does, Momma. Well then, take her into the other room so we can get started on our fun. Yes Ma'am. Finally, we get some alone time. I have wanted you since the time I first saw you. It wasn't fair that she got to have you for her lonesome with none of us around. It wasn't fair. It wasn't fair. Share and share alike. I should go take care of Kristy. See what she wants. Don't you worry, I'll be back for you. Momma, he got loose. My fault? You the one supposed to be watching him. I have seen you tie a knot to hold a truck. What the hell happened? Damned if I know? Forget about him! He can't go nowhere! You are a stupid son of a bitch. You stupid, stupid. Don't call me stupid, woman. I could break you. Ya hear. Break your little neck. Honey, calm down. You don't tell me to calm down. You don't treat me like no child. You are no child to me. You are my protector. You will always protect me. You are my life. You will protect me. Woman, I swear. You will protect me. You are my life. Momma. What do I always say? Your world would end if I should ever leave. That's right. You know it's the truth. That's right. It's just sometimes you get so damn mean. I know baby, I'm so sorry. I don't mean to get mean, but I just getting scared. I get scared. But you're my protector. You'll always take good care of me. I've always protected you. I always will. Wake and bake, man. Help! You've got to help me. Dude! You're in your underwear man. You got to help me. Those people are bat shit! They still have my friend. They're crazy! They drugged me! Look man, just calm down man. Have a smoke. I'm serious. We got go. Where is your car? What car, man. I hike these woods. We gotta go. You're not safe either. They're coming. It's cool brother. I know these woods, man. We're all right. I'm out of here. Those people are crazy. Well look, alright man, I just can't let you go traipsing around like that. I'll take you back to your cabin, alright? Just let me get my shoes. Hurry. You're on my property. No. No man. It's cool. I said, you're on my property boy. I can't stand you hippy types. You sons of bitches think you own the whole God damn world! This is my property! You hear? My Property! Well now city boy that oughta keep your ass from running off. You've seen what I did to that hippie piece of shit. I'm gonna do the same thing to you. But it's your lucky day, son! You're gonna get to play with Momma and me first! Please just let me go! I don't get it, city boy. We watched and that pretty young thing bumping uglies all day yesterday. What we got in mind, well, it ain't so much different. Me and Momma, we like the same things you do. Only we take it just a little bit further. Fact is, we're gonna open your eyes up to things you ain't never considered before. But don't pay it no nevermind. You ain't going to last too long anyway, pretty boys like you never do. Suppose we best be getting back to the house before Momma gets madder. Come on boy, we're going to have us some fun. You crazy fuck. Stay the hell away from me. You don't need that with me. The hell I don't. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help you. Then get the fuck out of my way. Wait! My parents, this land has been in our family for years. There are traps and lures all over. You won't ever make it. No one does. You mean, all these people? You won't make it out of here without me. I know the woods just as well as they do, maybe better. I can get you to the Sheriff. Why would you help me? They're monsters! No one knows that better than me. Then why are you still here then? I don't have anywhere else to go. You can get me out of here? Yes. What do you want in return? Take me with you, take me to the city. Wherever you go. I'm nothing like them. Please. You need me just as much as I need you. Okay. You promise? You promise you'll take me with you? Lady, if you get me out of here, I'll take you to London, Paris, anywhere you want to go. I knew it. I knew it when I saw you yesterday that you would be the one. We need to hurry. Yeah we should. Well let's get going. They could be here any minute. We should go. Mmm, baby. We need to, they could be here any minute. You need to calm down. Calm down? We need to focus on getting back to town. That's all you care about isn't it? At the moment? Yeah, that pretty much covers it. What about me? Were you just using me? What? You promised. You promised we would be together. How could you lie to me like that? Keep your voice down. You're a liar. You're a liar! Please. Baby please. Come back. Please. You said we'd be together forever. Please come back. Please. I'm going to fucking kill you, city boy. Please. Where are you? We'd be together forever. Forever! Come back! Come back! Baby, please! We're supposed to be together. Supposed to be together. Supposed to be together. You promised that we'd be together. I'm gonna fucking hurt you, I'll gut you like a fucking fish with this machete I got. I'm gonna fucking kill you, city boy. I got you right where I want you in these woods. You're so beautiful. Why did this happen? You were supposed to love me. We were supposed to go away together. You must love me. Love me. You see, electricity is like anything else, if you never really had it, you don't really miss it. Sheriff's office, go for Sheriff Westin. Thank God. You've gotta help me. I meet you yesterday at the grocery store. I'm at Myers Rentals. You gotta help. These people are crazy. They're trying to kill me. They're murderers. They've killed other people.

Okay. Sure, sure, I can meet you there. I can meet you there. I mean, I got some bad news though, the fastest way's there is through them woods. There is a path, if I remember correctly, that oughta follow out to highway 63. Put you out around mile marker 118. I can be there in about 10 minutes. I know the path. I'm leaving now. Hurry. Fuck! No! God dammit! God dammit! Why'd you have to go over there? Didn't I tell you not to go over there? You're daddy's little girl. I'm gonna skin that boy alive. You hear? You will always be daddy's little girl. I'll get you a new one. I don't want a new one. I want this one. Remember that old one you had? Annie? Yes, Annie. And you were so sad when Annie died. And then we got Caitlin and you became so happy? We'll get you a new one. Pick her up. Let's go. Ah fuck. What the fuck? Sheriff! I need your help. I need your help! Calm down, calm down. You're okay now. You're safe now. You're safe. Come on, have a seat. Here you go. Drink some water. Thank you. You alright? Pretty nasty cut you got there. Might wanna get you some medical attention. No, I'm fine. Kristy. They still have her. Kristy? You mean that beautiful thing you were with earlier? They still got her. Okay, well calm down. Everything's going to be alright. We need to go back. We gotta go back. Okay. Calm down. Everything's going to be alright. I need to call this in. Hang tight. This is sheriff Weston with disturbance out of highway 63, over. Copy that sheriff. Over. Looks like I'm going to need backup over here. I got a possible assault, a rape, murder, and God knows what else. Copy that. So you got him? Over. Yeah I got him Momma. I'm bringin' him in to ya. Whoa, whoa where you're goin' son? Please don't do this. Ain't no use in begging son. You did a very bad thing and now you get to pay the price. You ain't gonna hit me with no rock. Stupid ass Jesse.

You have no idea, but you have fucked with the wrong guy. Been a few like you from time to time, always talking shit. In the end, even the tough ones crumble. Surprised? You know, I've been wondering. Why you do it? You're about to find out, city boy. Yeah, sure, okay, but really, why? I mean, is it sexy to you? Does it fill a need? Some dark void left over from your inbred childhood? I do because I like it. It feels good! You about to find out why it feels so good, city boy. I'm gonna enjoy tearing up your punk ass! Really? Because it feels good? That's your only reason? And you do it with your family! I mean, that really threw me off at first. I was really scared there for a second. I don't usually let things get out of control like that. You ain't never had control. Sure, whatever makes you feel better. Oh, I'm coming for you boy. You know, I have been doing this a long time, never come across anyone like you guys. I mean you have a real mom and pop organization going on here. See me? I've always been more of a lone wolf, you know? I was planning on killing the woman who brought me here. You what? Yeah right? Fresh air? Seclusion? I have never killed in the country before. I was thinking it would be a nice change of scenery. Give it a whole "no one can hear you scream" motif. I love your death ditch with the lime, by the way. It's a good idea, I guess. You know, I like you in a strange kind of way. Well, like is a strong word. We'll say I admire you as a colleague and a peer. I'll tell you what. What the hell are you doing? If I did what I think I just did, I nicked your femoral artery. Call it a professional assessment. Eh? It's the main artery in your leg. You have about five minutes until you bleed out. Or maybe you find a way to stop the bleeding. You have got to learn to adapt if you wanna stay competitive in this field. Otherwise some young guns is just gonna come in and cannibalizing your territory. Metaphorically speaking of course. What the fuck are you talking about? You're going to want to stay pretty still. You're losing a lot of blood. You're probably feeling pretty light headed. I probably did some nerve damage too. Sorry. Now, you stay here and think about how you're going to improve your performance for next time. I'm going to go have a nice little chat with your wife. Good luck! You know, being a mother is a thankless job. You wouldn't know it yet but trust me, it's a thankless job. Oh, don't worry. Jesse's going to be back with your city boy. And then we're gonna go to a room. And we're going to have some fun. Won't that be fun? I did everything for her. And she still got herself killed by that pretty city boy. I mean I would understand it if it was a big man like Jesse. Well I guess she would have gotten herself killed by somebody. Don't you think? I'm sorry, I didn't realize rednecks had the monopoly on killing around here. Where's Jesse? Oh, he's just working some stuff out of his system. I am gonna gouge out your eyes. Oh good, you're awake. I was worried I did some real damage there. That would take a lot of fun out of this. Ain't this a son of a bitch? Lady, you really know how to ruin a guy's weekend, You know that? I'm so sorry I messed up your vacation. Kristy, I had big plans for her. Oh, do tell. Most girls I meet online are ready to go on a date before I even have the time to come up with a decent back story. I've never done that myself, so I don't know. Kristy, she took some convincing. Finally she agree to a date. She had this whole scheme worked out where we were going just get away from it all. You know, really get to know each other. And you know what? I liked it. I really could've used a nice getaway. Well nature can be a soothing to the soul. I was having a really good time. But you guys, man, I did not see you coming. Sorry to mess up your plans, city boy. What I was really looking forward to was just cutting loose. Really hearing them scream. Well, no point in wasting a good opportunity. You punch 'em first? You gotta take it slow. You gotta make them scream. You've got a knife? Otherwise you were the one who was lecturing me about wasted opportunities. Oh yes. Yes. That's much more better. All that talking you were doing earlier. That was all right. See, that lets them know you've got plenty of time and you're in no rush. Starts making it clear they are in for a long ride. Your instincts were right. But you did one thing wrong. You know when you're talking about all that stuff? You gotta touch them. All over, in all those places they never wanna be touched in. You touch them. Remember me doing that to you? Creepy right? That shows them who has the power, who's in control. It really adds to the sense of helplessness. Yes. Yes. That's it. Yeah. You're getting off on this? Being touched by the man who killed your husband? What? Jesse? He always comes back. Not this time. That's much better. You're getting it now. It's just not about the knife, everything about you is the weapon. I know what I'm doing. I've been doing this for a long time. I've been killing longer than you've been alive. I saw the pictures in the cabin. Caitlin told me those were your victims. I've killed many more people than that. Darling, I own five cabins on this land, every cabin has a mantle just like that one. I've never met anyone like you before. Like me. Momma? Hi baby. Stop! Leave daddy alone! No one knows you're here. She made all the reservations. We never met until I came over to your house. Online dating. Ooo wee! That is the most fun I've ever had at a gas station. We got some goodies for you. Here you go. Thanks Momma. I love these. I know you do honey, I know. And, we got one for your friend. Thanks Momma. Why was the gas station so fun? We got it all on video. Here, have a look. Man, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Come on. Come on, goddamn it! What the fuck are you doing? Just take the fucking money. Please, please! Don't! Don't! You don't even have to do this. You don't have to do this at all! Come on, man! Please man! You don't even have to do all. ♫ Just be glad you shot me when you did ♫ 'Cause you hither had've made ♫ Would've not been kind of you ♫ To see her gray and all that lonely ♫ Would've made me desire ♫ 'Cause still on my lips and my tongue ♫ To see a man slowly take his own life ♫ And watch it wash away in oceans of fear ♫ Does sinner have a name for himself ♫ As he lies, I cry ♫ And the world is self loathing and piss ♫ As of right now, I'm lonely ♫ Yes in their world ♫ Our dear, now I'm glad you ever would show ♫ The chills that I had ♫ And I brought it all for you ♫ I know that sort of fear ♫ The bullet hole to blame ♫ And tell it to the law ♫ That I saw that hole ♫ I never did ♫ As of right now, I'm lonely ♫ Yes in their world
