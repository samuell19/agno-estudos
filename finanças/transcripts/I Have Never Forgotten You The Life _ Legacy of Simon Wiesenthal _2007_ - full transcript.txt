(MultiCom Jingle) (orchestral music) - The man who was watching all of this very carefully is Simon Wiesenthal. - Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is with us now. (speaking foreign language) - The leading Nazi hunter-- - Known world wide as the conscience of the Holocaust. - Famous and successful Nazi hunter in the world. - He is a self-appointed instrument of world justice. - But he refuses to let his former tormentors live in peace. - Your organization have tracked down some 1,100. - Yes. - Nazis. Do you think it's still really worthwhile pursuing these men who must by now be fairly old? - [Reporter] Any lasting good is going to come out of tracking down these people relentlessly from country to country? - What do you do to people who say, Mr. Wiesenthal, it is time to forget, stop hunting these former Nazis, stop torturing yourself and the world and forget? - Mr. Wiesenthal, enough already. Enough time has gone by, enough heartache has gone by. There must be a statute of limitations on this. - Sure, sure, no. You must understand my office is the last office in the world. And because this is the last office we cannot close the office. I cannot stop. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] If you didn't know where you were as you walked down these steps, you'd think you were entering a beautiful nature preserve. But for Simon Wiesenthal, who arrived at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria two hours from Vienna in February 1945, this was hell. - [Simon] 185 steps. Every 10 minutes you must bring a stone from here on the top. During this time of this camp thousands die here on the steps. (orchestral music) Every step is for me dead corpses. Every stone is for me a corpse of a human, of a prisoner. And I am looking from the towers, you know, from the stones I saw people, dead people. This changed me. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] At the end of March 1943, SS chief Heinrich Himmler visited the camp. To entertain him, 1,000 newly arrived Dutch Jews were assembled at the rim of the quarry. One by one, they were thrown to their deaths 165 feet below. By the time of Simon Wiesenthal's arrival at Mauthausen, this had become a favorite pastime of the SS. They called it parachute jumping. (orchestral music) From 1938 to 1945 more than 130,000 men, women and children died at Mauthausen, gassed, shot, beaten, tortured or starved by the SS. (orchestral music) - It was something that I had never hoped in my life to see or experience. I was shocked, really and truly shocked, on my first visit to Mauthausen to see these dead people lying around in piles like wood, if you will, and others so sick and so weak, they're truly walking zombies. It was absolutely dumbfounding. And I thought to myself, what are we gonna do? (orchestral music) - [Narrator] As far as Simon knew he was the only survivor in his family. His wife and all of his relatives had been murdered. He was now a free man but what did freedom mean? - [Narrator] The man the Americans put in charge of granting the permits was a former Polish prisoner, Kazimierz Rusenik, who later became known as a leading propagandist in Communist Poland. - [Narrator] The following day Wiesenthal decided to seek Colonel Richard Seibel, the commanding officer at Mauthausen, to file a formal complaint against Rusinek, the man who had beaten him. While he waited he witnessed a sight in an adjacent office that amazed him. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal sat down and composed a list of 91 Nazi war criminals. It contained the names of such infamous SS criminals as Friedrich Katzmann, the SS major general who ran the murder machine in the Ukraine behind the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Jews, Amond Goeth, the commandant of the Plaszow death camp responsible for the murders of thousands of others, as well as many lesser known criminals. The document was unprecedented for its time, striking in its detail. Not only listing names and ranks of the perpetrators but specific dates and vivid descriptions of their crimes. - [Narrator] But the offices of the war crimes unit did not see Simon's involvement with them as anything long term. They tried to convince him that it was time to start rebuilding his life. - They say what you are, you are architect. Yes. Okay we will send you to our sanitoria, later you will go home and build houses again. Build houses? I say to him, you think you can continue in the same place that the life was interrupted? We have not only lost people and houses, we have lost everything, every believing. - [Narrator] Simon Wiesenthal now embarked on a career that would define the rest of his life. It was certainly not what his parents Asher and Rosa Wiesenthal had imagined for him when he was born 37 years earlier in Buczacz a small town in Galacia. (bells tolling) - I am born 31st of December, 1908 in Buczacz. In the time of my birth that was Austria, Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Later this was Ukraine, later that was Poland, later that was Soviet Union, then was Poland again. The whole population of Buczacz was 10,000, 6,000 Jews between 1,500 and 2,000 Poles and the rest were Ukrainians. (gentle music) - [Narrator] The family fled Buczacz and Simon's father Asher was conscripted into a Jewish unit of the Austro-ungarian army. Poorly trained and overrun by the Russians, the unit suffered tremendous casualties. - [Narrator] Around the time of Simon's 13th birthday tragedy once again struck the family. - [Narrator] Simon began attending the local high school in Buczacz, where he immediately stood out amongst his fellow students. - It was forbidden to speak Yiddish, and because I have to resist against such situation, so I teach a number of my non-Jewish colleagues in Yiddish. And the man, one professor of history he was antisemitic. He was comic, I had a quarrel with my non-Jewish colleague and he say to me in Yiddish. The professor was looking, what's going on here? (chuckling) - [Narrator] Simon also tried using his sense of humor to attract the attention of one of his classmates, Cyla Mueller. - He was sitting right behind her and my mother tells that she had this long blond hair and it was braided and whenever the teacher was not looking then my father started pulling those braids and she stayed there and she did not laugh and everybody around looked and started to laugh and as soon as the teacher came my father was. He liked that. - [Narrator] In 1928 Simon was accepted as an architecture student at the Technical University in Prague, which did not have the same quota restrictions against Jews that were the case in Poland. - In 1930, I was in a place, Reichenberg, I was coming to a friend. The majority of the population was German. It was a speech of Hitler in radio, before he came to power. And all the windows on the street, with the radio, with the speech of Hitler. I said, ach, this is impossible, this man cannot have a chance in a country of philosophers, of thinkers, of inventors. - [Crowd] Sieg heil! (orchestral music) - [Narrator] After finishing his studies in 1932, Simon went to Lvov, also known as Lemberg, and began working for a Jewish-owned architectural firm. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal was soon developing a reputation as an architectural engineer, designing apartment buildings, houses, and office structures. In the mid-1930s, he designed the building he was proudest of: a house for his mother and stepfather in Dolyna. (orchestral music) (roaring) (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Simon, Cyla and his mother Rosa gathered what they could and moved into the Jewish getto of Lvov. Within weeks, Simon and Cyla, along with thousands of other able-bodied Jewish men and women, were taken to the Janwska concentration camp and put into forced labor battalions at the Eastern Railway yards. Rosa remained in the ghetto. Occasionally, Simon and Cyla were able to arrange for passes to go and visit Rosa. - From all the stories that I remind my mother, about the time when we was in ghetto. She prepare something for us to eat. And then, she never eat with us. And then one day, she felled, and I catch her in the air. For five days she had eat nothing. Everything for us. This is, you know, so dramatic that everything else had not made on me this impression. Only this moment. This moment. A real Jewish mother. - [Narrator] Several hundred miles away, a high-level meeting was taking place in an elegant villa on the shore of Lake Wannsee, just outside of Berlin. Taking minutes of the meeting was an SS major, Adolf Eichmann. The subject of the conference? The implementation of the final solution of the Jewish question. Within the six weeks of the Wannsee conference, trains from Lvov and other parts of the Ukraine began taking Jews to a place called Belzec. Very few lasted the day. In the course of 14 months, approximately 1.6 million Jews were killed at Belzec and two other death camps in Poland: Treblinka and Sobibor. - [Narrator] Several days passed and Simon heard that Ukrainians were rounding up Jews in the ghetto. When he heard no word from his mother, he made his way to her flat and was met by her next-door neighbor. - [Narrator] Simon rushed to the main railway station in Lvov. He ran frantically from one cattle car to another. - People was naked in the wagons, without nothing. And you hear, "Water, water, water, water." (speaking faintly) Nothing, it was not the possibility to help. The situation with the wagons and these people, I have dream many times. Many times I see me, that I'm running, and I could not help. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] It was August 23, 1942. The train left Lvov, and a few hours later arrived at Belzec. - [Narrator] Simon was now concerned that the same fate would befall Cyla. He contacted a friend in the Polish underground. - [Narrator] Cyla was taken to Warsaw, where she was given a new official ID as a non-Jewish Pole. A few weeks later, Simon went into hiding for seven months. But in a Gestapo raid, Wiesenthal was discovered. After three failed suicide attempts, he began a five-month odyssey of pain, torture, and suffering as the SS transported him across Europe from one death camp to another. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] Wiesenthal's physical condition was so poor as he walked through the gates of Mauthausen that he was placed in a barracks for hopeless cases. Despite his weakened condition, Wiesenthal managed to draw what he was seeing around him. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] For the next few weeks, Wiesenthal continued to sketch, until his liberation on May 5th. - [Narrator] A few weeks after his liberation, Simon Wiesenthal was at work for the US War Crimes Office, helping to gather testimony of survivors to be used in hearings against Nazi war criminals. - [Questioner] What is your nationality? (speaking foreign language) Austrian. - [Narrator] Along with several other survivors, he was now living in the Leonding, Austria, outside of Linz, not far from Mauthausen in a former schoolhouse converted into a small displaced persons camp. From the window of his room, he could look out on the community's small cemetery and churchyard adjacent to the school. He had an uneasiness about waking to the sight of headstones each morning. But when he learned that his room also overlooked the graves of Alois and Clara Hitler, the parents of Adolf Hitler, as well as the Hitler family home, he put in a transfer to new quarters. He was soon living in a small rented room on one of Linz's thoroughfares, the Landstrasse. Just four doors away were the offices of his employers, the US War Crimes Office. In the summer of 1945, Wiesenthal and a group of other survivors put together a committee to search for family members and friends who may have also survived the camps. - [Narrator] He wrote to Biener and asked him to see if he could find out what had happened to Cyla in Warsaw. Amazingly, Cyla, passing through Krakow on her way home to Buczacz, found Dr. Biener. He immediately sent word to Simon that she was alive. Wiesenthal asked his superiors for permission to go to Poland to bring Cyla to Austria. But the War Office was concerned that Simon might be arrested by the Soviets on his way to Krakow. In his place, Wiesenthal sent a friend. - [Narrator] Three weeks later, Simon's friend appeared at his front door. - [Narrator] Pauline Rosa Wiesenthal was born in September 1946. She was named after her two grandmothers, both of whom had perished during the Holocaust. Simon was now spending a great deal of time traveling from one displaced persons camp to another, collecting testimony from survivors about war crimes. He was learning more and more about extent of the final solution and its chief architect. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] Without ever having pulled a trigger, this SS major was responsible for more murders than any other member of the Nazi party. At the request of his superiors, Eichmann formulated the details and organized the mechanisms which led to the systematic genocide of six million Jews. During the same time in Vienna, Arthur Pierre was also learning more about the crimes of Adolf Eichmann. Pierre's real name was Asher Ben-Natan, and his main task was working for the Jewish agency facilitating the Brichah, the illegal effort to bring Jews from the DP camps to Palestine. - I started to delegate new immigrants who came to the refugee camp in At-leet, (speaking foreign language) Nazi crimanls that they'd met, or they knew about. I had compiled a list of 700 war criminals, many of them Austrians. - [Narrator] That night, while poring over his files in his flat, his landlady came in to bring him some tea. - [Narrator] Just up the block, on the same side of the street at Number 32, was an electrical repair shop, Elecrro-Eichmann. One floor above was the childhood home of Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann's father and stepmother were still living in the apartment. The following morning, Wiesenthal convinced the Americans to immediately conduct a search of the Eichmann home. They found no trace of the son. The parents did not even possess a photo of their eldest child. - [Narrator] Manus was Manus Diamant, a survivor who was working with AFA in the Brichah. The plan was for Manus to romance Eichmann's former girlfriend. - This woman showed him all her photos, and suddenly he saw a photo of Eichmann. That's the way we got the first photo of Eichmann. In the meantime Wiesenthal found out that Eichmann's wife and two children were living in Bad Aussee. (cows lowing) (birds twittering) - [Narrator] Bad Aussee, in the lake region of Austria, is considered one of the most picturesque areas of the country. It is also where many high-ranking Nazis escaped to at the end of the war. It was to this small town that Veronica Eichmann and her sons retreated in 1945. There were rumors that her husband, having slipped through the hands of the Allies at the German POW camp at Rosenheim, Germany, was also hiding out in the area, occasionally sneaking into the basement of his wife's rented home for clandestine meetings. - Wiesenthal really fought, all his life, for something that at the time seemed strange, which is to say that Nazi criminals, one shouldn't just take revenge against them. The important thing was to bring them to justice and to leave the historic record of what they'd done. - Revenge is a human feeling. And after a time, you have enough, just like food. You cannot eat the whole day. You cannot hate the whole day. - [Newsreel Announcer] Out of bombed and devastated Nuremberg, comes the last grim chapter in the record of the Nazi war criminals. - [Narrator] Once the major Nuremberg war crimes trials were completed in 1946, many of the officers working with Simon at the US War Crimes Office returned home. Their replacements were more concerned about a new threat coming from Moscow than they were about Nazi war crimes. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal made a difficult decision. He would open his own documentation center. He gathered a group of fellow survivors together and explained what he was about to do. More than 30 volunteered to work with him. - [Narrator] As Simon was launching his new documentation center, Cyla was busy at home raising Paulinka and trying to create a safe haven for her family. - To grow up as a Jewish child of Holocaust survivors in Linz after the war was lonely. It was very lonely, very insulated. Books, lots of books and lots of books. Few friends, not much going out. My mother shielded me from the surroundings. I remembered one day, I came home from school, and I said, "Why don't we have relatives? "No uncles or aunts, or grandparents. "How can that be, what kind of family is this? "Only just the three people." - I cannot tell the truth, she will not understand. And when I don't tell her, she will look up the other children. Like of children from murderers. So I call a friend in Vienna, I told them the story. The next day, I say call your cousin and invite her. Then every holiday, we find somebody in Salzburg, some other cousin in Vienna. And when she was 11, slowly I began to tell her the whole truth. - [Narrator] The stress of Wiesenthal's work and trying to support his family began to take a toll on him by the early 1950s. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal took to his new hobby with the same intensity he brought to his work. He was soon meeting and trading stamps with very serious collectors, including an Autrian baron who invited to his home one evening in 1953. As they looked out at the view from the baron's palatial estate, Wiesenthal explained his line of work. The baron, who had been an anti-Nazi during the war, was quite moved. And then he remembered a letter someone had sent him recently from Argentina. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal sent the information on to Dr. Nahum Goldmann, the chairman of the World Jewish Congress, and one of the most prominent Jewish leaders in the world at that time. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal was crushed by the response. In addition, the new realities of the Cold War were making the work of his office increasingly impossible. Simon decided he had no choice but to close his office. - [Narrator] For the next few years, Simon worked as a teacher and a freelance journalist to support his family. But Eichmann was never from his mind. Wiesenthal knew that Veronica Eichmann and her sons had disappeared from Bad Aussee. He began investigating and learned that Veronica was now living in Buenos Aires with a man named Ricardo Clement. But was this man Adolf Eichmann? There was no recent picture to prove whether or not he was. This dilemma was solved when Wiesenthal noticed a death announcement in a Linz newspaper, for the funeral of Eichmann's father in early 1960. - [Narrator] The photo was transmitted to Mossad agents already staking out the Clement household on Garibaldi Street in Buenos Aires. - I had those pictures with me from Wiesenthal and could compare the men I saw near the house to the people he photographed at the funeral. - I remember seeing him on television. It was broadcast during the Eichmann trial. It made a tremendous impression on me. This is when I started being aware of what he was doing. - [Narrator] Simon Wiesenthal quickly become recognized around the world as the man who caught Adolf Eichmann. He wrote a bestselling book about the case, but did mention the role of the Mossad. Wiesenthal had been asked by the Israeli government to keep quiet about the participation of its secret police. - He said (speaking foreign language), he didn't say, "I found Eichmann." he didn't claim that. And he did (speaking foreign language), he did chase Eichmann. As a matter of fact, he was the only one who systematically tried to find him and work on his family and all the rest. He didn't, I read the book, I don't think he claimed anything that wasn't true. (orchestral music) - After the Eichmann trial, things changed. We moved to Vienna, my father reopened the office. And he was not going to close this office. There was no way that he would close it for a second time. - He was viewed as a man who could not stop thinking of the guilt of other people. And the Austrian politics for 20 or 30 years was we shouldn't talk about that, it's unnecessary. Are they really war criminals? - There were all these phone calls at night. Frightful phone calls-- - Hello? - in the middle of the night and my father runs to pick up the phone, and he puts it down immediately. My father didn't perceive it as a threat. - [Narrator] But Simon's attitude changed when the threats started being directed at his only child. - My father took precautions and I mas taken to school with police cars. Which was dreadful. A child, to have to go to school with a policeman trailing behind it and picking it up and taking it back. That doesn't do you a lot of good. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal was far more popular outside of Austria. In Holland, for instance, a group of non-Jewish supporters put together a special fund to help finance the work of his new documentation center. Simon felt a special affinity to the Netherlands because of the story of Anne Frank. - [Narrator] In the late 1950s, during a performance of the play based on The Diary of Anne Frank, young neo-Nazis disrupted the actors, tossing pro-Nazi leaflets and screamed that Anne Franks's story was a fraud. - Thousands and thousands of young people in Austria and Germany believed them. And against this propaganda, the best way was to find this man who arrest Anne Frank family. Because if he will tell that Anne Frank was existed, because I arrest her, this will be believable. - [Narrator] Looking in the appendix of the diary, Simon found a reference to an Austrian SS man who arrested the Frank family. - Mr. Wiesenthal in Vienna believed at first that the man was called Silbernagel. So he asked us whether we had information on a member of the German police force which was specializing in getting Jews out of their hiding places, called Silbernagel. We happened to have a document in our files. A really unimportant document as such, it's a telephone list of the commanding officers of the German security police in this country. And here on one of the final pages we found the name of Silberbauer. So we passed on this name to Dr. Wiesenthal and he was able to locate him as a member of the present-day German police. - It is 840 miles and 20 years from the house on the Prinsengracht in Amsterdam to this house, bell-let Strasse Number 5 in suburban Vienna, where police inspector Karl Silberbauer's past has come back to haunt him. - He was interrogated, and he tells right away. (speaking foreign language) "I arrest Anne Frank." The case was for me finished. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] On a trip to Israel in 1964, Wiesenthal was approached by a woman who asked, "Are you Wiesenthal the Nazi hunter?" When he replied that he was, she insisted, "You need to do something Hermine Braunsteiner." And she began to tell him about Braunsteiner's brutality. - She threw them just like you throw in garbage. Incinerated, this was the way she was throwing small children. She was tearing the children from mothers' arms, throwing them to the truck. And if a mother didn't want to give up the child, the mother was taken also. I could still hear the cries of the children and the mothers. Those cries you could never forget, never. - [Narrator] Back in Vienna, Wiesenthal began looking into what happened to Braunsteiner. Starting with her last known address in Vienna, he learned that she had disappeared in the late 1940s to her family in the Austrian Alps. Wiesenthal sent a young volunteer from his office, who was able to obtain the key information: Braunsteiner had met and married an American GI named Russell Ryan. Wiesenthal tracked the couple to a quiet neighborhood in Queens, New York. Armed with this information, he called the New York Times. - Joe Lelyveld, who at the time was a very young reporter, ripped apart the notion that no Nazis were in the United States and forced government officials to look at the real facts, the real truth. - [Narrator] It would take more than a decade to deport, and finally try, the Majdanek guard for her war crimes. - It was an embarrassment for the Justice Department, for the government of the United States, and there was pressure to set up an office of special investigations to investigate Nazi war criminals. And Simon Wiesenthal provided information on a great many cases that were prosecuted in the United States in the early days. - In Dusseldorf, West Germany today, a court ended a five-and-a-half-year-long Nazi war crimes trial, the longest and most expensive war crimes prosecution, by sentencing to life imprisonment a former New York City housewife. She was the first American resident to be turned over to West Germany for war crimes prosecution. - As he became more known, he became this man that you just couldn't push away. When things didn't work out, when he had gone to the ministry 10 times, he had written 50 letters, and no reply, he started using the press to put pressure to get things going, get things done. It didn't endear him to anybody, but there were results. - [Narrator] In 1966, Wiesenthal held a press conferenece at Schloss Hartheim, a castle built in 1600, about two hours from Vienna, which was the euthanasia testing center for the Third Reich. Some of the first experiments with Zyklon B, the gas used to kill millions at Auschwitz and other death camps, took place there. Franz Stangl, who became the commandant in Treblinka, responsible for the murders of 800,000 Jews, trained at Schloss Hartheim. A few days after the press conference, an odd-looking, unkempt man showed up at Wiesenthal's office. He had a proposition for the Nazi hunter. - [Narrator] Simon immediately called a contact in the Sao Paolo Police Department, and Stangl was arrested on his way home from work. But a problem arose immediately. - [Narrator] Kennedy, the former attorney general and now US Senator from New York, persuaded the Brazilian ambassador to convince his government to keep Stangl in custody. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal now had to make good on his promissory note. So he called a friend in the United States and the money was transferred as promised. He never revealed the identity of this or any other informer. - [Narrator] The strain of the trial and imprisonment took a toll on the Treblinka commandant. Less than six months after being sentenced, he died of a massive heart attack. While investigating the Stangl case, Wiesenthal discovered another criminal on his most-wanted list living in Brazil: Gustav Wagner, Stangl's former top sergeant at Treblinka, and later the commandant at Sobibor, where more than 250,000 Jewes had been murdered. When Wagner heard about his friend Stangl's arrest, he was petrified that Wiesenthal would come after him next. - The mere thought that Wiesenthal would be on the case meant that lots of malefactors could not sleep at night. - [Narrator] An error was made in the translation of the indictment, and Wagner was released by the Brazilians on a technicality. - [Narrator] In 1967, Simon Wiesenthal's memoirs, The Murderers Among Us, became an international bestseller. There was no question that here was the main address for anyone looking for information about Nazi war criminals. - I went down to Vienna, and I thought he would give 20 minutes, tops. He gave me two and a half hours. He became enthused, and his enthusiasm was contagious. - [Narrator] The young author outlined a story about a Nazi concentration camp commander for Wiesenthal. - Then I was saying to him, could we just devise a fictional concentration camp commander? And he just beamed and waved (chuckling) a proprietorial hand at a shelf and he says, "Why," you know, "why invent?" He said, "I have the man for you." And he reached out and he rummaged through these files, and he brought this file down. He said, "His name is Roschmann, "Eduard Roschmann, the Butcher of Riga." - [Narrator] The Oddessa File was not only an international bestseller, it also became one of the top-grossing movies of 1974. - O-D-E-S-S-A. - [Narrator] And now Simon Wiesenthal was a character in a major motion picture. - It was formed at the end of the war to help SS men to disappear, to get them out of Germany. - [Narrator] The worldwide release of The Odessa File ended up having a result that neither Simon nor Frederick Forsythe could have predicted. - Roschmann. - There was a man, an Argentine, sitting in a little town 200 miles south of Buenos Aires, watching this film. He suddenly thought, that man lives down the street from me. Really, that is him. He went and denounced. The local magistrate had him arrested. Buenos Aires involved the German embassy. The German embassy said we want an extradition warrant. And he panicked, and he ran for the safety of Paraguay. And he was actually crossing the Paraguay River and his fright overcame him, he suffered a massive internal heart attack right then and there. - [Narrator] Eduard Roschmann, the mass murderer of women and children, never regained consciousness and died a few days later. - I hope I can correct a false picture about me. I am not a Jewish James Bond. And I am not a Don Quixote, and I'm not between. I am only a survivor who pays with dedicated work for the privilege to remain alive. (speaking foreign language) (orchestral music) - The main thing was to write letters to lots of state attorneys, ministers of law, Yad Vashem, the police. Put down testimonials. - Sometimes he was so full of energy and ideas and leads that we had to jump at and to write letters and sometimes he was really - We got hundreds of letters and postcards. Some sent money, some asked questions. Quite a lot of letters and postcards said, "Well, you are a criminal." - We had to put a big M on these letters and go to these big boxes where we collected these things. That was File M, meshugge. - The meshuggene box. - Yeah. - [Narrator] Some of the letters asked Wiesenthal to become involved in a particular case. Like the one received from Sweden in 1971. - The mother of Rauol Wallenberg asked me to be occupied with this problem. - [Newscaster] More evidence came to light today that the man they call the Swedish pimpernel is still alive in a Soviet jail. - [Newscaster] As a young Swedish diplomat in occupied Hungary, Wallenberg saved tens of thousands of Jews by signing makeshift passports bearing the right to Swedish nationality and diplomatic protection. - [Narrator] Not long after the Soviets entered Budapest, Wallenberg was taken into custody by the Russians and disappeared. - For me as a survivor, and for me as a Jew, I feel our duty to help this man. The criminals can wait. But the man who is in oppression, whom the whole world must be thankful, cannot wait. According to a number of witnesses, the Soviet declaration that Wallenberg die in Lubyanka Prison, on July 17, '47, cannot be true. What we wish to know is the truth. - [Narrator] From the time Raoul Wallenberg's mother was first in touch with Wiesenthal, he never missed an opportunity to bring up the case in public, as well as in private meetings around the world. - [Announcer] The President of the United States. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal's efforts helped to gain honorary US citizenship for Wallenberg, so that the American government could lobby on his behalf as a citizen. It was only the second time in US history that an individual was given this honor. - You and I know each other fairly well. And I know you to be a realist. What are the chances that we'll ever see him alive? - Well, a Jew must believe in miracles. A Jew don't believe in miracles, he is not a realist. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] In 1975, Wiesenthal found himself going up against two of Austria's most popular political figures. - [Narrator] While going through an SS directory, Wiesenthal had turned up evidence showing that Friedrich Peter, the head of Austria's People's Party, had been a member of a mass murder squad responsible for the killings of as many as 350,000 Jews in the Ukraine. (gunshots booming) - [Narrator] Austria's popular socialist chancellor, Bruno Kreisky, himself a Jew, refuted Wiesenthal's charges. He was working with the People's Party to create a ruling coalition. When Wiesenthal went public with his information about Peter, Kreisky was furious. - [Narrator] The media battle between Simon and Kreisky reached its lowest point when the Austrian chancellor questioned how Wiesenthal had survived the war. - My father was in shock. I think he was prepared for many things, not for this. People did not know whether to speak up or to support him. And you didn't know which way it would turn. The papers turned this into a Jewish story, about the Jew Kreisky turning against the Jew Wiesenthal. Which made it even uglier. - Wiesenthal became extremely unpopular. 83% of the Austrian population thought that Kreisky was completely right. 3% thought Simon Wiesenthal was right. The main paper in the country, they wrote, "Wiesenthal should get out of this country." He was hated. He was hated. - [Narrator] The situation grew so out of control that the building housing Simon's office on the Rudolfsplatz was attacked by Nazi sympathizers. Windows were broken and bomb threats were made. Frightened residents, many of them older Jewish Holocaust survivors, begged Wiesenthal to move. He relocated a few blocks away. - My wife said to him, "Simon, why do you stay in Vienna?" And his answer was very simple. A soldier stays on the battlefield. - [Narrator] While Wiesenthal was being vilified for exposing Friedrich Peter's membership in an SS murder squad, a politician was being honored by the Austrian people. (German folk music) - [Narrator] When he retired from the parliament many years later, he received a standing ovation for his service to the country. (piano music) - [Narrator] Almost since the time of their reunion, Cyla had wanted Simon to leave Austria and start a new life with her in Israel. Now, as people literally spat at them as they walked together in Vienna, she begged her husband to move. Her desire to leave had become even stronger after Paulinka and her husband, Gerard Kresiburg, announced their plans to move from Holland with their three young children to the Jewish state. (orchestral music) - Despite my mother's hopes for a different life, there was this strong, strong bond that tied them. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] Simon Wiesenthal was one of the first Jewish activists to publicly discuss the plight of non-Jews who suffered during the Nazi era. - It was not only Jews, it was Frenchmen, it was Dutch people, it was Russians, it was gypsies. Why not, they are in a common mass grave, why don't mention them? - [Narrator] Wiesenthal became a special advocate of the gypsy or Roma community, which had lost hundreds of thousands in the death camps. - As well, the homosexuals. At that time, he was among the few people who said, "Well, we have to think "that 50,000 who were homosexuals have been killed there." - This is important. The young generation from many nations, for their benefit, should learn from our tragedy. Because what happened once to us can happen again. The only alternative is tolerance. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal's example became the inspiration for a young rabbi based in Vancouver, Canada. - I knew that Yad Vashem was a great repository of the story of the Holocaust. But not an activist group, they were not involved in doing something about it, in terms of counteracting anti-Semitism. And it occurred to me that no one more fitting could be found in the world than Simon Wiesenthal to create such an institution with an address in the United States. It was in August of 1977, we went to Vienna. We spent a morning session, afternoon session. He asked us many questions. What he said to us is, "There a lot of people "who gather information, store it in the freezer, "and forget about it. "I'm not into that." He said, "I wanna gather information, "and when there's a recurrence, "I want people to stand up and do something about it. "In that kind of an institution I'm interested." That's precisely what we had in mind with the Simon Wiesenthal Center. - [Newscaster] Wiesenthal toured the new center this morning with Governor Brown, and he officially opened it by affixing the traditional Jewish mezuzah above the door. (speaking foreign language) - [Narrator] The first official collaboration between the new Simon Wiesenthal Center and its namesake involved an issue being debated in West Germany's Bundestag: the statute of limitations for Nazi war crimes. - The statute of limitations will be at the end of next year, and after that time, when we will find new people, they commit crimes or I find new evidence of people, they are free, we cannot bring them for justice in Germany. - Simon comes up with an idea. We're gonna send a postcard with that very difficult and horrible photo on it, of one the Nazi war criminals torturing a prisoner. No time-limited justice. - One million postcards were mailed around the world. And we said to the people, if you want to make a difference, send this postcard to the German Bundestag, and to Chancellor Schmidt. - And he invited a small but representative group to come and discuss this issue with him, with the Bundestag, with the German officials. It's an extraordinary invitation. And we spent a week discussing, cajoling, twisting arms. The final vote, which we won by 23 votes out of approximately 500-person Bundestag abolished the statute of limitations forever. - Ladies and gentlemen, there's a time coming when I need your help. - [Narrator] Almost immediately, Wiesenthal and the Center initiated a second campaign, focused on a man Simon viewed as one of the worst criminals of the Holocaust. - Walter Rauff was one of the deputies of Heydrich. And this man was responsible for the gas trucks. They pick up people on the railway station, put them in a truck with the sign of the Red Cross. 50, 60 people in a truck. And this was a terrible death. After a half an hour, sometime after 45 minutes, the people was dead. And during that way, they killed 250,000 people. He lives free. - [Reporter] Undeterred, he walked nonchalantly toward his son's house. There at the gate he came face to face with an unwelcome visitor carrying a hidden radio microphone. - [Reporter] You live in Santiago, don't you? - Huh? - You live here in Santiago. - [Walter] Yes. - You are fighting your case? - No. (chuckling) - Walter Rauff was found in Chile. And the question was how to move Pinochet. Pinochet wouldn't easily give up a Nazi war criminal, even if an extradition request came. Simon came up with the idea that we should have a postcard campaign showing what Walter Rauff did. We put out 100,000 postcards with a picture of that van. When the postcards were received, there was international pressure on the Pinochet government. We got a message. The chief of staff in Pinochet's office, saying, "Okay. "If the West Germans reapply the extradition request, "we'll honor it." As soon as there was word of an extradition request, Rauff died of a heart attack. At his graveside, all of his comrades defiantly met at his funeral and gave a final Sieg heil. (clattering) (shouting) (sirens wailing) - I know it was on a Friday that my parents' house was firebombed. And I was in shock. This was serious, it was no joke. It started his police protection. There was no police protection at all beforehand. My parents' house became an island. Outside was the police in front and in the back, and inside was the island. Any threat made my father more convinced that it was his duty to continue. - I respect Simon Wiesenthal. And I am proud to call him friend, and prouder still that he calls me friend. - [Narrator] Helping to boost Simon's spirits were a series of events in the United States that put him into the spotlight like never before. - Freedom is not a gift from the heavens. You have to fight for it every day of your life. (audience applauding) - [Narrator] But then a dramatic, unexpected development in one of Wiesenthal's longest unsolved cases started to raise questions about the reliability of his work. - Medical experts in Brazil said today they were reasonably certain that the bones they have been examining are indeed those of Josef Mengele, the Nazi angel of death. - [Newscaster] After two weeks of study the doctors and investigators were conivnced. - This skeleton is that of Josef Mengele within a reasonable scientific certainty. - [Newscaster] What's known is that Mengele lived in solitude in various houses around Brazil for 18 years before drowning off this beach in 1979. - [Narrator] Almost from the moment he had started working for the US War Crimes Office, Simon Wiesenthal had been searching for Josef Mengele. - Mengele was the chief physician of Auschwitz. He was the hand of Eichmann in Auschwitz. Two or 300,000 children he killed for the experiments and also sent to the gas chambers. - There were many children there with their parents. Two, three-year-old, four--year-old, five-year-old. Then he told the man, the father, "Go on the right side." To the mother, he told, "On the left side." So the fathers start to cry and the wife, "Give me my children." And they took a child. And the SS man, one took his leg, and the other one his leg. And the head down, and they said, "One," or Dr. Mengele said, "One two three," and they parted the child, tore the child apart. And then gives the father a piece, and the mother a piece. Not one time. Not one time, many times I saw this my own eyes. - We need Mengele for a German trial, before a German court. A trial of Mengele will be a won battle against the deniers of the Holocaust. - [Narrator] Wiesenthal kept Mengele's name in the headlines by helping to stage events like a mock trial of his crimes in Jerusalem. - [Interviewer] If you had a personal statement to make to Mengele, what would it be? - To surrender. This was Mengele '43, and this is Mengele now. This man is living in Paraguay. - [Narrator] After tracing Mengele to South America, Wiesenthal kept an eye on the Mengele family in Gunzburg, Bavaria, where they maintained their lucrative farm supply business, one of the largest in Germany. He urged West German officials to tap the phone and intercept the mail of the family's busniness manager, Hanns Sedlmeier, in the hope of finding Mengele's exact address. But the authorities refused after Sedlmeier insisted he had never been in contact with the fugitive. After the announcement of Mengele's death, volumes of correspondence and phone records proving that he had been in close touch with the Auschwitz doctor for decades were found, just as Wiesenthal predicted. Yet he was criticized for having been on the wrong trail, claiming that Mengele was alive in Paraguay when in fact he had been dead in Brazil for years. - There were and still remain today alive, many people who personally suffered at the hands of Josef Mengele. And to hold out hope to them, and these people held out hope, that their tormentor, their torturer, this mass murderer would be brought to justice, when the information was not accurate, I think is cruel. - He had no official capacity. He had no subpoena rights, he had no investigators. He had no money, except the limited money to keep him going. I mean, if you go to any detective, US attorneys, there are more false leads than all positive leads. For these people to criticize him, that there were false leads, thank God he was making the leads. Thank God he was trying to get these people. There was one office in one place in the world where people who had information knew they could go. There had to be a place where accountability could start, and that's where it was. - But is going everything to a biological end. Criminals die, witnesses die. I will die. But how long people from these two generations are alive, the matter must remain an open matter. And as a warning for the future, that these people, they commit crimes, will never rest. (orchestral music) - Despite all he'd been through, despite all the pain he'd suffered, despite all the humiliations and the horrors he'd seen, there was a genial, jovial man there. - He was a very, very good storyteller. He remembered jokes, and one joke triggered the next joke. And what made me laugh was to see him laughing because he couldn't finish his joke. And halfway or towards the point he started to laugh, and we looked at him and started to laugh and say. - Lovey, possible-- (speaking foreign language) - He several times came from his office to our office and wanted to tell us a joke. (chuckling) But sometimes we didn't understand it. (chuckling) Sometimes it was a joke that he should have told perhaps to a male person. (chuckling) Not to a lady. (chuckling) - I remember when he attended the premiere of The Boys from Brazil. Gregory Peck was of course playing Mengele. And Sir Laurence Olivier was supposed to be a character like Simon Wiesenthal. And Simon said to Sir Laurence Olivier, "He is a better Mengele, "than you are a Wiesenthal." - As well as weeping all of his tears, he was a man capable of laughing all of his laughter. - [Narrator] Sir Ben Kingsley starred as Simon Wiesenthal in an HBO film based on his bestselling memoirs, The Murderers Among Us. (shouting) (orchestral music) - I'm one of the few people who have been allowed to create a portrait of Simon Wiesenthal. I met him in Vienna. And the first gesture I remember is this. And it's never left me. Never left me. We must never forget. I'd never seen anyone else physically embody a whole generation of grief in one gesture and have it completely communicated to the listener. Do not forget us, and do not forget our murderers. Can you believe? He manages to tap into the collective grief and the understanding of grief in all of us, whatever our history. This I think is tremendously unique. Because if you cannot grieve over loss, you cannot begin to address that loss and repair the damage done. And I believe that he was doing enormous service to healing wounds, and not keeping them open. - Some very serious allegations have surfaced this week against the former secretary general of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim. Waldheim is now running for the presidency of Austria. - [Newscaster] Recently released photographs and documents link Waldheim to two Nazi groups and to a general who was hanged for sending thousands to their deaths in concentration camps. (speaking foreign language) - [Newscaster] This is the sound of skeletons falling out of the closet. (speaking foreign language) - [Interpreter] You are traitors, you should keep quiet and stay in Israel. (speaking foreign language) - [Interpreter] Where were you in the war? You did shoot Jews, admit it. - [Newscaster] Still the issue remains: How serious are the charges against Kurt Waldheim, and what effect will they have on Austria's voters? Next month the voters will decide. - When the issue of Waldheim came up, and there were those people, including myself, who said, "Simon, condemn him," and he said, "No." Because he felt Waldheim did not rise to the level of a Nazi criminal. - [Narrator] In one press conference and interview after another, Wiesenthal tried to explain his position, to no avail. He believed that his views on Waldheim's character were being distorted. - I know that some people, maybe between you or maybe other people, will think I am coming here to attack Mr. Waldheim, no, believe me, not. When I present a case, the documents will be hard, very hard. The language very moderate. If not, people will say, you are a hater and we don't believe you. - No greater disaster could come by calling him a person a Nazi war criminal, taking him to court, and having the court acquit him for lack of evidence. On that, Simon Wiesenthal was absolutely right. But, to take no no action at all, we felt, was also not appropriate. Because here was a man who certainly knew better. He rose through the ranks to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. We had a disagreement, Simon Wiesenthal and the Center, about whether Kurt Waldheim should be placed on the watch list. - [Narrator] Responding to a public outcry in the United States, congressional hearings were held to investigate whether or not Kurt Waldheim should be placed on the so-called Nazi watch list, an act that would bar him permanently from the United States. - Based on your findings, is it your view that Dr. Waldheim is in fact guilty of committing war crimes? - What we know is that Waldheim is an indicted Nazi war criminal. We are fairly optimistic that the answer will be found right here at the US National Archives. - You cannot accuse and later look for documents. This is not the way of justice. We should never mix politics with justice. - [Narrator] Despite being elected Austria's president, Kurt Waldheim was not allowed to visit the United States, even on official business. - Professors and experts on the Holocaust, and I think one or two Nuremberg prosecutors, came up with the conclusion that Waldheim's acttivities did not rise to the level of a Nazi criminal. Which is the conclusion that Simon came to. It would have been so easy for Simon to condemn him. That's all he had to do, join the bandwagon. But he said, "Then I sacrifice everything I stood for." (audience applauding) - The Austrian people finally decided to come to proper terms with Austria's personal history and to accept that it shared in the responsibility for what happened during the Nazi era. At that point, Wiesenthal started being pulled out as this sort of living legend, a monument to the people who had tried to bring Austria to its senses. - Going to my grandfather's office. (speaking foreign language) - [Simon] Sure. - [Filmmaker] This is the room of Opa there. - [Filmmaker] This is a sculpture of Opa-tee's head. - He lived in an attached house in a suburb of Vienna. Always the same attached house. (speaking foreign language) And here is Oma-chen. - He had the same three suits. They were shiny after a while. He didn't take any money for what he did. His money that he took for his own personal living was what he wrote and his speaking. And that was it. - He had a battered Peugeot. That car was probably at least 20 years old. - He used to he used to eat nuts, and he'd crush them basically, by using this hand gear. The car was always a junkyard. - [Narrator] Cyla also had no interest in material things. What was paramount in her life was her family. - My mother was in love with the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren. - This was the pleasure of her life. This occupied her, and even though she didn't see them that often. I never figured out how she knew so much about them. - I now have pleasure to invite Mr. Simon Wiesenthal, special envoy of the Austrian government, to take the floor. - [Narrator] Almost 90 years old, Simon continued to speak out on the idea of justice for the victims of the Holocaust. He also delivered speeches and wrote articles about genocides taking place in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia, and Rwanda. He continued working on behalf of political prisoners around the world. In his ninth decade, it seemed as if the honors never stopped coming. - From the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, only a few voices survived, to bear witness, to hold the guilty accountable, to honor the memory of those who were killed. - [Narrator] In 2000, President Bill Clinton, in one of his final acts in office, awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Simon Wiesenthal. Too ill to leave Vienna, Simon asked Rabbi Hier to accept the award on his behalf. - I think it's Medal of Freedom. - [Narrator] By 2002, Simon's health was too fragile for him to continue coming to the office. He worked at home and stayed current with the affairs of the world. - Then of course when Cyla died, he went down pretty quick. He used to like to kid that she was four months older than he was. He used to say, "She's much older than I am." - The way I would like people to look at my grandmother is that my grandmother, in her way, played a very important role for this whole operation that my grandfather led to happen. - After our death, there will need, all these people, was killed by the Nazis. And they ask you, what you are doing after the war? And I will tell them, I didn't forget you. (orchestral music) - [Narrator] On September 20, 2005, Simon Wiesenthal died peacefully in his sleep, at the age of 96 at his home in Vienna. (orchestral music) At his request, he was buried in Herzliya, Israel, not far from the home of his only child. The following summer, a special ceremony was held, unveiling the headstones of both Simon's and Cyla's graves. - There are lonely years where no one listens. Sometimes the Bible says it's 40 years, sometimes it says it's 40 days and 40 nights. With Simon, it was a certain number of years where he was a prophet in the wilderness and nobody listened. It is the quality of being a genuine prophet that will get you through those years. Enormous inner faith. - Without Simon Wiesenthal's activity, without Simon Wiesenthal's vision, there would not be war crimes trials today, either in the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda. The reason that there is a permanent UN War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague is directly attributable to the work that Simon Wiesenthal began in 1946 with the American Army. - No one had a more stacked deck against him than Simon Wiesenthal. He came out of the Holocaust with nobody, nothing. 99 pounds and he was barely alive. And with that, he wouldn't give up. To me that's the lesson of Simon Wiesenthal. That one person, if they want to and if they try, can make a difference. He made a difference in the world. - It was a hard life, it was difficult life. But this little Jew, from this little village in Poland or Ukraine, wherever you look for it, which you can't even find on the map, look, it's a long way. (audience applauding) - One day he called me and he says, "Rabbi Hier, I wish to celebrate my 90th birthday "with a few friends in the Imperial Hotel in Vienna." I said, why the Imperial Hotel? And he said, "Let me tell you why." This was Hitler's favorite hotel. He had a permanent suite there. Heinrich Himmler, the head of Gestapo, had a permanent suite there. Hitler loved the hotel so much that he would conduct the Second World War from the hotel. And when he had to get out of Vienna, he would use the bunker underneath. And Simon said, "I want the history of this hotel to read "that Simon Wiesenthal held his 90th birthday here "with a kosher dinner." (orchestral music) We had people fly in from all over the world. He was weak, but this was a special occasion for him. He told me that he'd slept four hours during the day, in order to make sure that he'd enjoy every minute of this occasion. (orchestral music) As the band was playing Mein Shtetl Belz, a very popoluar Yiddish melody, he turned to me and he said, "Rabbi Hier, "look, even the chandeliers are shaking. "Because in this hotel "they never heard music like this. "Hitler is gone. "The Nazis are no more. "But we are still here, singing and dancing." (audience applauding) (orchestral music) (solemn orchestral music)
