FRANK: What are you doing, Luke? We're camping out tonight. Ah! Perkins' backyard. Well, good luck. We'll be at the Clancy's if you need some backup. Thanks. Are you set for school? I'm all set. What about clothes? I was thinking, the blue striped shirt with the khakis your grandmother brought you... Would go great with the word "dork" stamped on my forehead. Oh, come on. It wouldn't hurt to look nice on your first day of school. First day of middle school, Mom. And, yeah, it would hurt a lot. -He's right. -FRANK: We gotta go! Okay. Good luck at the talent show, and if I don't see you before, I'll put your guitar backstage after my face-painting shift. Okay. Bye, Mom. You must be really nervous, huh? Why would I be nervous? Maybe because the whole town is going to be there. If you screw up, that will be the most embarrassing thing ever. Well, we're not gonna screw up, okay? I hope not, for your sake, because in middle school, guys like Meat will "Henderson" incoming wise guys like you. That's such a myth. Really? When was the last time you saw Chris Henderson? -He moved. -So they say. Although, the last time anyone saw him, he was going into the boys' bathroom. Well, my back's covered. (SCOFFS) By who? A.J. and Riley? Please. Are you guys even in the same classes? Oh, then forget about your back, because you'll barely see each other during the day. That school is huge, and even when you do they'll probably be too busy hanging out with their new, cooler friends anyway. (EXHALES) We don't care about cooler. -Yeah, right. -"Yeah, right," is right. (SIGHS) Tomorrow is the last day of summer. Did you take all the soda? Maybe. Well, give me one. What do you say? Please? Well, I was saving this for a special treat later on, but... Hmm. You're welcome. (SCREAMING) Luke! (SQUEAKS) LUKE: It's gonna stink, no way around it. I mean, we get different teachers for every subject, and they all give homework like they're the only ones giving it, so we get five hours a night, which means after school is shot, and the school itself, it's so huge, we'll barely ever see each other. It's gonna stink. At least it will be fun to meet some new kids. See? It's already started. What did I say? You're already talking about breaking up the group. -No, I'm not. -Dude, Steel Monkey is, like, forever. Anyway, we can still see each other during recess. There's no recess. What do you mean there's no recess? There is no recess. So what are we supposed to do after lunch? You go back to class. So all we have is gym? Actually, that's called health science now. You're kidding. No gym, no recess. It sounds like the bathroom is the only break we get. (LAUGHING) What? (SIGHS) You don't want to go to the bathroom, dude. -Why? -If Meat and his crew catch you there, it's... It's what? Remember Henderson? Whoa! I thought that was a myth. Me too, until I found out otherwise. But what if you really have to go? Then you really gotta hold it. -Until we're in the eighth grade. -(CHUCKLING) We still got one last day of summer... -Hmm. -...to max it on everything worth living for. So what do you say, fellas, Steel Monkey to the limit? ALL: Steel Monkey rules! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) But there's only one thing left to say, gentlemen. -What? -What? -(FARTING) -RILEY: That's so rude, dude! -(GAGGING) -Must have air. The zipper's stuck! (ALL STRUGGLING) (VENDORS SHOUTING) -Hey, Mom. -Hey, sweetie. Mind if we leave our stuff here? -Well, actually... -Thanks, Mom. -Thanks, Mrs. Malloy. -Thanks. Sure. Have fun. I heard if you blow chunks on this, they let you ride again for free. Really? Cool. Okay, super powers. Would you rather have super strength or be able to fly? Hmm. Fly. Okay, fly or become invisible? That's easy, nothing beats invisibility. All right, invisibility or the ability not to smell A.J.'s farts? (LAUGHING) Oh, look who's heading our way. -Hey, guys. -What's up? Oh, my God, Sorenson, what happened? What? Oh, I'm sorry, it's just your natural face. -Oh! -(BOYS LAUGHING) Har, har, har. You're such a loser, Perkins. So what's the deal with Steel Monkey anyway? There is no deal, it's the name of our band. -Hmm. -Yeah. But is it steel, the metal, or steal, like, ripping something off. -Both. -Yeah. That's appropriate, because, like you, that makes no sense. You know, that hurt. I heard you guys are pretty good. LUKE: Yeah. So you got Molesky for homeroom, too, huh? Hmm-mm. I heard if you blow chunks on this ride, they'll let you ride again for free. -(DORY LAUGHING) -(SIGHING) Wow, thanks for the tip, Malloy. I hope you puke on loser here and then do it all over again for free. -Good luck tonight. -I'm sure you'll need it. -Thanks, appreciate it. -A.J.: Wacko. -Why do I ever listen to you? -What? Blow chunks, ride for free! That's what I heard, dude, what's your problem? The problem is that he likes Alice. What? No, I don't! Why do you even hang out with them? Girls are so annoying. I said I don't even like her. -Okay. -Sure. -Whatever you say. -I don't! (GROANS) I don't know. (ALL GROANING) (YELLING) (YELLING) Wait a minute, Luke, your diaper's on backwards. Huh? Really? (CHUCKLING) Whoa! Okay, get ready, get set, go! All right, stop the applause, guys, stop the applause. -(LUKE GROANS) -In your face! -Whatever. -Yeah. -Maybe Sorenson is right. -About A.J. being a loser? (A.J. LAUGHING) No, maybe we should debut another night. What other night? I don't know, I just don't think we're ready for tonight. Are you kidding? We've been practicing, like forever. You're not chickening out because of those girls, are you? No! It's just... What if we went out there and stunk? Stink compared to what? I mean, my seven-year-old cousin and her friend are doing a tuba duet. Yeah, but when they screw up, it's cute. We screw up, and we're the biggest losers in middle school, and we're not even there yet. If you're so worried about screwing up, just picture the whole audience naked. -Mmm. -Are you kidding? My parents are gonna be there. Point taken. Bad plan. I'm sorry. Look, Luke, we just gotta go for it and that's all there is to it. Uh, A.J.? -What? -You're not gonna eat that, are you? Ten-minute rule, dude. If it's been sitting here for less than 10 minutes, you can eat it. So it's cool. Scientific fact. The guy's slobber on the meat is also a scientific fact. Oh, and that's why we eat from the uneaten side. Like this. Oh, no. (MUFFLED) It's so delicious. You should try some. It is delicious. Not that. Meat and his friends, 4 o'clock. Your other 4 o'clock. Come on, stop. Coming this way. Hey, you dorks don't mind if we join you, do you? (MEAT CHUCKLES) So you guys are what? Going into second grade? (OLDER BOYS LAUGHING) -(SOFTLY) Sixth. -No way. You guys are incoming pukes. (MEAT LAUGHS) Well, new school buddies, you won't mind sharing some of your food with us while we visit? We're starving. (OLDER BOYS LAUGHING) We should get together like this during the school year. Heck, we should start tomorrow. Get together, stuff our faces, unless you'd rather we flush yours. (SOFTLY) Oh, no. Whoa! Hold up, little buddy. You don't want to drop that cone now, do you? Give it here. Whoa! (GASPS) There, now you don't have to worry about it. (OLDER BOYS LAUGHING) Now, where were we? MEAT: Now. LUKE: I can't believe Meat already knows us. RILEY: I guess we just have to pack double lunches and a set of nunchucks. You think since we'll be feeding them, they'll let us go to the bathroom? -Go, Maxine. That's it. -Okay. Hey, Maxine, you gotta keep pedaling. MAXINE: I don't know how you do this. (SCREAMS) Ouch. Been there. You all right? Here you go. She should've kept pedaling. MAXINE'S FATHER: One more time. (CHEERING) -Dude's a God. -He's beyond God. -What's beyond a God? -Dude is. Isn't that so cool? He makes my face hurt. RILEY: Huh? You know, from all the cool. Never mind. ALL: Oh! (CHEERING) -What say we go catch a little ourselves? -Yeah. Come on, Luke. It's no big deal. You can do it. We've only got 17 hours and 33 minutes of freedom left and that's if we don't sleep, so let's go. All right, all right. What? What is the matter this time? I just felt a twinge in my calf just as I was about to take off. Caught a case of the chicken fever is more like it. Come on, Ri, show this chicken how to fly. Whoa! Four, five feet, easy. (LAUGHING) Dude, that was awesome. Hey, that was fluid, little brah, that was fluid. Thanks, Snake, you were awesome over in the bowl. It's NBD. The secret's all in your melon, brah. Really? What kind? I mean, there's cantaloupe, honeydew... -(LAUGHING) -This melon, brah, this one. And you gotta be one with your ride. Are you fluid? Oh, yeah, I'm as fluid as milk. Well, then roll up over here and share some skin, brah. Oh! You're gonna see this little pup strutting with the big dawgs someday, sha? Let me get that board. This your sponsor right here? One down, one to go, huh? What are you talking about? He's just over there for a second. Uh-huh! What are you doing here, anyway? Hanging out. With who? Where's Audrey and Stephanie? I have more than two friends, unlike you. Nice helmet, man. Not like I didn't warn you, dawg. Warn you about what? All right, get on that board, show us that trick again, man. Nothing. (PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Hey, I need a little help to lift up the tail, I'll help you out. Hey, guy. It looks good. Looking good. Oh! Audio check. (FEEDBACK SOUNDING) Hello, Walker's Point. Fifteen minutes until show time. Summer's last hurrah! RILEY: Oh, come on, Luke. We will seriously spew if you're gonna be this way. Sorry, it's just... Hey, Luke, according to you, life basically ends tomorrow anyway, so we might as well go out and rock it. See in there. Why does tomorrow always have to come anyway, huh? Why can't it just stay today for a while? That's impossible, Luke. Duh, A.J., it's a wish. I wish it would just stay today for a month, a year, forever. MAN 1: Yo, a little help, please. -Heads up. -Thanks. -What do you mean? -What? MAN 2: Hey, Harvey. HARVEY: What? MAN 2: Never mind. (DOG BARKING) LUKE: Uh, what? (SCREAMING) What's the matter, man? -What's wrong? -What's going on? I don't know. What? How should I know? Well, you were the one screaming. Well, yeah. This doesn't freak you out? -What? -All this? We're in the tent, in the same clothes, surrounded by all the same junk. -And? -And? What do you mean, "And?" We're supposed to be getting ready for school right now, but instead we're back here. What's the matter with you guys? You don't remember? No. We did all this yesterday. We haven't done anything today, so how do you know... Because today is yesterday. Then what was yesterday? -The day before, which makes tomorrow... -Today. Except today is yesterday, so... Stop it! September 1st. It really is Labor Day again. Wait a second, it's coming back to me. When the aliens came last night, they did say something about time warp. -They did. -Really? I don't remember that. Dude, you're the one who's warped. Now go back to bed, you need it. (CHUCKLING) Wait, you guys are messing with me, right? By pretending that yesterday is not today, when, in fact, it really is? -Uh-huh. -Even though we were both just asleep? Ah! Look, we were all sitting around talking about tomorrow, and A.J. was getting all worked up about how there's no recess in middle school. -How can there be no recess? -There is no recess. So what are we supposed to do after lunch? Go back to class, I already told you. -So all we have is gym? -Actually, that's called health science now. You're kidding. No recess, no gym. BOTH: Sounds like the bathroom's the only break we get. Whoa. Cool. How did you know that? I've been trying to tell you guys. Yesterday, today, is happening all over again. Just like I... Oh, my gosh. It came true. -What did? -The ultimate do-over. All right, then. So what happens next? (CHIPMUNK SQUEAKS) Don't ask me, ask your butt. (STOMACH RUMBLING) (FARTING) Oh, that's so rude, dude. Air! The zipper's stuck! Can't get out! (GROANING) Dude, that's horrible the second time. A.J.: Enjoy it. (RILEY SQUEALING) I heard if you blow chunks on this, they let you ride again for free. Why would you ride again after a hurl? 'Cause it's free, duh! Okay, super powers. -Would you rather... -Fly. -Okay, fly or... -Nothing beats invisibility. Except not having to smell A.J.'s farts. Look, Luke, I don't know what you're doing, but stop it. I mean it, you're freaking me out. -But it's... -No, I'm serious. A.J. and I already talked about it. It's not funny anymore, so just stop it. Please? Okay? -Okay. -Good. I just hope the girls aren't heading our way. Oh, look who's heading our way. -(GIGGLING) -Stop it! Oh, it's cool. I'll handle this. -Hey, guys. -Hey, ladies, how's life on the Red Planet? What? Mars. Come on, you're not fooling us, we knew you guys were really Martians. What are you talking about? Why are you acting so weird? I was just trying... He thinks today is some kind of do-over. -What? No, I don't. -Yes, you do. -Do you? -He does. You do. Right, A.J.? You remember how you freaked out in the tent this morning? And you've been acting like you knew everything that I was going to... -Okay. -And we're the Martians? Okay, I know it sounds weird. That's all right. No need to explain. -(SIGHS) -Mr. Wacko. We gotta be going anyway. Hope you feel better. Good luck tonight. I'm sure you'll need it. RILEY: Thanks. -Thanks a lot, guys. -What'd we do? You made me look like a total nut-ball. And your point is? What do you expect? Between this do-over thing and liking Alice... What? Are you kidding me? I just called her a Martian. Exactly. What do you mean, "Exactly"? Well, in shrink talk, my folks would say you're overcompensating. Meaning, it's normal to say something stupid to a girl you like to show you don't like her, even though you really do. That makes no sense. But neither does liking a girl, dude. I don't like her. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't. What's that word again? Overcompensating. Now that's a good one. A.J.: I don't know. (GROANING) (ALL GROANING) A.J.: Riley. Get my hand, please. -Oh, thank you. -RILEY: I'm falling. (YELLING) (YELLING) Wait a minute, Luke. Your diaper's on backwards. Huh? Really? (SCREAMING) Ready? (SCREAMING) RILEY: Okay, get ready, get set, go! Hold the applause, hold the applause. -Whoa! -Oh, yes! -He beat you. -So who won? We only have one debut, one time to make a first impression, one time to launch the Steel Monkey legend, and I just don't think we're ready for that critical leap, you know? You're over-thinking this, dude. We just gotta go for it. And that's all there is to it. Why do we have to sit here anyway? What do you mean? It's gross. Let's go sit over there. This is fine. Lot of meat left in that burger, eh? Thinking what I'm thinking? I say it's been there six minutes, seven minutes, max. And if you eat it... From the uneaten side, slobber-free. Scientific fact. What are you guys talking about? Shh! (WHISPERING) Keep it down. Meat and friends approaching on the right. Your other right. Oh! Hey, you folks don't mind if we join you, do you? They're such jerks. How old are you guys, like, five, six? (LAUGHING) You guys still need your mommies? What should we do? We could go over there and get out butts kicked. Gotta do something. No. Let's leave before they decide to join us. (MEAT AND FRIENDS BOOING) Look at you, you're about to cry. -Wait. -Oh! If it makes you feel any better, he was gonna take it anyway. You're so dead, dude. Me? Why? -Come on, man! -Split up! LOLA: Hey, you barnacles! Don't worry, don't worry, I do not pinch. I am a politically-correct crustacean. Unless you got a pot of boiling water, then I'm scared. Hold on there to your britches, Captain. Don't you see these minnows crossing? You don't want to step on one of them, do you? Oh! You know what? Come over here. Come over here. Lay a little claw on this old crustacean, would you? I think I got something stuck up... Come on. Ah! Gotcha! That's an old arthropod joke, sir. Land-lubbers... What you gonna do? Okay, so who's having fun? Come on! All clear! Thank you, talking lobster lady. Over there. AUDREY: Hey, Luke. Hi, Audrey. Is your sister around? No, she's at the skate park with Snake and those guys. -Oh. -Huh. Okay. Well, tell her we said hi. -Over there, man. -There he is. Man, I can't believe that little puke got away. Don't worry, we'll get him. If not here, then tomorrow at school. -In the bathroom. -BOY: Yes. -You wanna Henderson him? -Good idea. (SIGHS) ALICE: What? Sorry. I was just looking for something. So do you speak Martian or would you rather talk in English? I have a sister, so, you know, I can go either way. So you got Molesky for homeroom, too, huh? -Yeah. -Me, too. You just said that. Sort of. Well, my Martian's a little rusty. Uh... You know, I heard if you connect the moles on Mr. Molesky's face, it looks like the State of Idaho, which is the state of famous potatoes. And who's the most famous potato? Mr. Potato Head. Get it? All Mr. Molesky needs is one of those little derby hats and... -(CLEARING THROAT) -What's the matter? MOLESKY: Nothing at all. Mr., uh... What are you staring at? -Idaho. -What did you say? I said, I don't know, sir. Good thing you have a sense of humor, Mr... -Malloy. -Malloy. Because starting tomorrow, you're gonna need it. You're toast, Malloy. LUKE: I will not be a dork. I will not be a dork. I will not be a dork. I am one with my ride. I am one with my ride. I am one with my ride. Okay, it's now or never. It's now or never. Yo, there's a guppy in the bowl. Get the stretcher. Go, will you? Take your spill and then get out of my way. We got a Dawg Pound try-out here. -You can try out for the Pound? -Invitation only, dude. Hey, Snake, tell this kid to take his tumble. I'm ready to shred. Hey, just chill, brah. Relax. Little dawg, is this your first drop? (CROWD HOOTING) -Word of advice. -Be one with my ride? Yes! Oh-ho! L-dawg's been carving into my melon! How did you know I was gonna say that? Irie, now be your ride, all right? Come on. Are you crazy, Luke? You're gonna die! Hey, just let him be, brah. Just let him be. Irie. The moment of vengeance shines upon us, people! (CROWD HOOTING) -Yeah! -Whoo-hoo! Let's get down to business. Come on. (SCREAMING) Ugh! (ALL GROANING) Oh! -Uh! -It's okay. That was, like, so awesome, dude. ALL: Oh! L-dawg, you were like a seven with your ride, which, if you do the math, is like six too many. It's a little more L-spaz than L-dawg. (ALL LAUGHING) Step aside. Are you all right, dude? I suppose, in a completely humiliating sort of way, yeah. A.J.: Hey, like Snake was saying... Actually, I didn't understand a word he said. -But you tried. -Yeah. Even if it was a... (BOTH SCREAMING) BOTH: Oh! Hey. That was crazy stupid, L-dawg. (INAUDIBLE) Oh! GIRL: Hey! (SIGHS) What is it with jerks like Meat, huh? What makes them so mean? Well, my folks just say, "He's probably a nice, sweet kid who's just insecure. "Chances are his home life's a mess, "causing feelings of anger and frustration." -That's why he bullies little kids like us. -(MUMBLES) It gives him a false sense of empowerment, which, if not addressed, could possibly lead to a life of crime. Oh! Now you know what my family dinners are like. So does it work? I mean, talking about it like that? Well, that's what they get paid for. Hello, Walker's Point. Fifteen minutes until show time. (IMITATING ELVIS PRESLEY) Thank you. Thank you very much. So what advice would your parents give for someone who's afraid he's gonna get taken out. What do you mean, "Taken out"? Yeah, 'cause chicken out is more like it. -It's not that. -Then who's gonna take you out? -Harvey. -Harvey? That guy. -But it first starts out with the Frisbee. -What Frisbee? -This one. -MAN 1: Yo, a little help, please. -Only this time when the guy yells... -MAN 2: Hey, Harvey. -HARVEY: What? -I'll duck. -MAN 2: Never mind. -Ta-da! (GROANS) LUKE: Let's just get this over with, okay? There's no more recess, you go back to class after lunch. A.J.: What are you talking about? LUKE: Gym's called health science, you have to hold it until eighth grade and Meat'll "Henderson" you. And, no, it's not just a myth. Now can we start the day? Oh, except one more thing. RILEY: What? LUKE: A.J., if you please. (FARTING) (GROANING) RILEY: Oh, that's so rude, dude! -Must have air. -(GIGGLING) I can't believe summer's almost over. Uh, dude, don't remind us about school. Hey, maybe tomorrow won't happen. Yeah. And maybe this ride will suddenly whip around and be fun, like the ride we should have gone on. How'd you talk us into this anyway? Well, I seem to be stuck in this day-long do-over time warp, so I decided to, you know, switch things up a bit. Did you know that "stool" is another word for turd? -What? -What? Seriously. I was at the doctor's office and this nurse asked a guy for a stool sample. And I'm thinking, "Metal or wood?" But then the guy hands him a tiny steamer. -Seriously? Are you kidding? -Oh-ho, no way! Yeah. So what'd the guy do, just leave it on the counter or something? No. It was, like, little plastic containers. You know the one they put the pills in? How does someone take a dump in a pill container? I have no clue. Just aim and fire, I guess. What's so funny, Perkins? Let's see. That time at lunch when you squeezed cherry yogurt out your nose, -that was funny. -Yeah, that was funny. And, of course, there's your face. ALL: Oh! Har, har, you're such a loser, Perkins. Nice, dude. Hey, you guys want something to drink? ALL: No! -Too bad. -Open wide. ALL: Oh! No! You're so dead, Sorenson. (LUKE LAUGHING) What's so funny? Come on, guys, you got them, they got us. What's that supposed to mean? It's a tie? Against the girls? (CHUCKLES) You want? You're kidding, right? Just wish me luck. What for? Hey, you guys don't mind if we join you, do you? LUKE: No, please sit down. We were hoping you guys would stop by. Well, then I guess this is your lucky day. (MEAT LAUGHING) Hey, you wouldn't mind sharing some of your food while we visit? No, please dig in. Uh, so, Meat... Mind if I call you Meat? Would you rather me call you something else? Mr. Meat, perhaps? How about I rip the tongue out of your head and you won't have to worry about calling me anything? -Uh. -Hey. You should look at me when I'm talking to you. What did you say to me? Hey, I know manners aren't taught in broken homes like yours, so... Whoa, whoa. Broken? What are you talking about? -Your parents don't live together... -Whoa, whoa. -Yes, they do. -Are you sure? (CHUCKLES) Of course you're sure. Hey, I'm just trying to start a dialogue here. To let you know that we know that bullying kids like us gives you a false sense of... What's the word? You talking to me? I hardly know this guy, Luke. If that is his real name. Listen, dog breath, one more word out of you and I'm gonna send you to tomorrow. Actually, that's harder than you think. Okay. Come on, Meat, I'm... You're probably a nice kid stuck in a big jerk's body. -Ooh! -LUKE: Shh! I'm just trying to save you from a... From a life of crime. Let's go! -LUKE: Split up! -Get them. I can't believe that little puke got away. MEAT: Don't worry, we'll get him. If not here, then tomorrow at school. In the bathroom. -Oh, yes. You wanna "Henderson" him? -Good idea. Okay. Hi, Alice. Hey. 'Sup? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yo, baby. MOLESKY: And a "yo" to you, Mr... -Malloy. -Malloy. Though I prefer the salutation "Mr. Molesky" to "babe." -I wasn't calling you... -Relax, Mr. Malloy, I was just dealing you the dozens. (CHUCKLES) Sir? Filling your sails. Giving you the old T-step, two-step, the Molesky shuffle. I doth turneth your crank. I was kidding, dude. Oh! See you tomorrow. MAXINE'S FATHER: Okay, here we go, Maxine. That's it. All right. I can do this. I can do this. Keep looking. I can do this. (MAXINE SCREAMS) Ooh! Are you all right? Are you crazy, Luke? You're gonna die! Hey, just let him be, brah. Just let him be. Irie. You should listen to your buddy. It's fluid, dawg. It's all fluid. Whoa! Listen to the cho, brah! (WHOOPING) SNAKE: Hey, that's irie, L-dawg. Moment of vengeance shines upon us. (CHEERING) Yeah! Ah! Be one with my ride. Be one with my ride. Be one with my ride. Ugh! (ALL GROANING) SNAKE: L-dawg. Drop wasn't a total woofer. But on the face you were more like a four with your ride, which, if you do the math, is like... Three too many. You been tapping my blog, brah? Come on! What? Hey, very few dawgs shred on the virgin drop. You just gotta keep rolling and keep spilling till those wheels stick to the plumbing. -Sha? -ALL: Sha! Thanks, Snake, I will. De nada, L-dawg, de nada. I can't believe you did it. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen you do. -De nada, dawgs, de nada. -Hey. -That was crazy stupid, brah. -Thanks. Hey, Audrey and Stephanie were looking for you. What did you tell them? I just said you were here. How did you know I was here? I...just did. Well, there's no law that says I have to hang out with them all the time. Hey, hey, hey. I was just giving you the message, not trying to arrest you. Good. First Meat, then the pipe, what's up with the death wish, dude? Empowerment. That's the word I was looking for. No, that's more like suicide. No, no, no, no. I tried to get Meat to realize that bullying kids like us gave him a false sense of empowerment. You sound like my parents. The only way to deal with a psycho nutjob like Meat is to kick his butt. Yes. Now he tells me. (FEEDBACK SOUNDING) Hello, Walker's Point. Fifteen minutes until show time. Summer's last hurrah! Pain. Humiliation. Pain... What the heck are you doing? Humiliation it is. It's hard to explain, but it first starts out with this Frisbee. MAN 1: Yo, a little help, please. -Heads up. -Thanks. -MAN 2: Hey, Harvey. -HARVEY: What? -MAN 2: Never mind. -Oh, yeah. Now, you go, Harvey. Oh, yeah. MAN 1: Yo, a little help, please. (LUKE SIGHS) -Heads up. -Thanks. -MAN 2: Hey, Harvey. -HARVEY: What? -MAN 2: Never mind. -Yeah. You go, Harvey. Whoo! Whoa. (STRUMMING AIR GUITAR) -MAN 3: Hey, look out! -(GASPS) Come on, Luke, we're about to go on. What are you doing? Looking for an answer. Well, what's the question? Am I the butt of some cosmic prank being played out by forces beyond my control? Hmm. (CHUCKLING) -MAN: Hey, Harvey. -What? (GROANS) MAN: Never mind. (METEOR WHISTLING) -A.J.: There's only one thing left to say. -RILEY: What? A.J.: Luke, what are you doing? LUKE: Playing fact or fiction. (STRIKING MATCH) -(FARTING) -(EXPLODES) (GIGGLING) (BOYS COUGHING) RILEY: Ew, that's so rude. LUKE: It's a fact. A.J.: Sit down, enjoy it. (GROANING) Let's go find Luke. Shoot. Hey. Hi. -Um, I'm alone. -Oh! Then what are you doing here? I was just checking out the butterflies. -You? -I love butterflies. Do you collect them? No, I like them better alive. They probably like that, too. Yeah. -So have you seen them? -Seen who? The butterflies. Uh... You gotta check this out. Wait. Close your eyes. Trust me. Okay, open them. Whoa, this is like the coolest thing I've ever seen. Where'd they all come from? Mr. Molesky. This whole thing is his exhibit. Really? Wow. And tomorrow he's bringing our class back here for the release. -He's gonna let them all go? -Mmm-hmm. He does it every year. I heard that it first starts out with this little speech he does about how all the butterflies are getting ready to take flight and how it's a new beginning and blah, blah, blah. But then, when he opens this thing up, this cloud of butterflies comes flying out. It'll be so cool. They like you. Great. I guess. Oh, it's a good thing. -Aren't you scared at all? -About the butterflies? No, tomorrow. Middle school. Oh. A little, yeah. I mean, I'm nervous, but who isn't, you know? Well, I'll see you later. Wait. Why is it a good thing that they like me? Well, some people believe butterflies are more than just insects, that there's something magical about them. Do you believe that? Why not? I'll... I'll see you later. Later? At the talent show. -You guys are still playing, aren't you? -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) You're so cool performing in front of all those people. Now that would scare me. Good luck. (ALL GROANING) Oh! (ALL GROANING) -Hi, Mom. -Hi, hon. Can I talk to you for a moment? Sure. Let me just finish up here. It's important. -Oh, go ahead, don't mind me. -Thanks. Come here, sweetie. You see, a while ago I sort of wished for a do-over day, and, lucky me, it happened. Oh, I see. -Well, that's wonderful, dear. -Not anymore. I'm stuck in this day and I don't know what to do. Did you get much sleep last night? It's not about that. -You'd be surprised... -Mom, you're not understanding me. Well, we mothers never do, do we? -It's not like that. -It's as if we were never kids ourselves. Look, I really need to talk to my mother here, okay? By all means. I wonder what he wants. I don't know how else to explain this, but for me, there's no tomorrow. Aw! Wow, you can see the future. You must know my son Melvin. He's in eighth grade and knows everything, too. I don't know him. Of course you do. Come on now. He's big for his age. He always wears black. Chains, leather-studded belt? Just a phase. Yeah, if you're a budding psychopath. -Luke. -Is that jealousy rearing its ugly head? -Jealousy? Are you kidding? -Luke Malloy. -What has gotten into you? -I've been trying to tell you. But never mind. Luke. LUKE: Oh, no. Not again. Let's just get this over with, okay? (FARTING) (MUFFLED LAUGHTER) Ugh! (BEEPING) One, two, three, testing, one, two. Nice. Just give me a minute, guys. (SIGHS) Hello? LUKE: Hey, buddy, you mind? I'm working under this one. Just kidding, meatball. -Who's down there? -It's your old buddy... Henderson. And you know where I'm coming from. What are you doing down there? (ENGINE STARTS) What's going on? What do you want? An eye for an eye, meathead. A taste of your own medicine. (WHISTLING) Whoa, whoa, wait. Hey, hey. Can we talk about this? (SCREAMS) (MEAT SHOUTING) MAN: Is somebody in there or what? Hang on. -Hi, Mom. -Hi, hon. A.J. and Riley were here a moment ago. They said they've been looking for you all day. Oh, uh... I'll catch up with them later. I've got a message for the lady here. Your son Melvin wanted me to tell you he feels like... (BLOWS RASPBERRY) He's over by the porta-potties. You might want to bring a hose. Hey, Luke. -Hey. -Is your sister around? No, she's at the skate park. Ah! Okay. Well, um, just tell her we said hi. Sure. Hey. Do you wanna know the secret to riding a bike? -Yeah. -Be one with your ride. -And keep pedaling. -What do you mean? Come here. Now we're gonna start. When I let go, you're gonna keep pedaling. You'll find your balance, but only if you keep going forward. Keep going for it? Exactly, keep going for it. Hop on. -So what are you gonna do? -Keep pedaling? -And? -Keep going for it? -Couldn't hear you. -Go for it. I'm sorry, did you say something? I'm going to keep pedaling. Oh, geez, I must have something stuck in my ear, 'cause I can't hear you. Keep pedaling and go for it! Yeah, Maxine, way to... -(SCREAMS) -Oh! -I did it. -Yeah, you did. I'll try to remind you tomorrow. I won't forget, I promise. Oh, yes, you will. I promise. Hey, there he is. Luke! Oh, 'sup, dawgs? What do you mean, "'Sup, dawgs"? We've been looking for you all day. Sorry, I'm just sick of the rides. What? I mean, I didn't feel well, so the rides would've made me sicker. -You know? -Yeah. -Right. -Mmm-hmm. Okay. Anyway, I gotta go. What? Where are you going now? To the bowl. Are you kidding, Luke? You're gonna die! Not today, brah, not today. Did he just call me a "brah"? I think so. Yo, there's a guppy in the bowl. Get the stretcher. (CROWD LAUGHING) Funny, brah. Truly hysterical. Hey, just take your spill and get out of my way. I'll go when I'm ready. Hey, Snake! Tell this kid to take his tumble. I'm ready to shred. So am I. ALL: Oh! What you saying there, ese- brah. I'm saying I wanna shred the plumbing so I can roll with the Pound. You fluid? Irie, L-dawg. We're fluid el mucho, boy! Come on, Snake. This is a joke. You shaking, dawg? Ooh! (ALL HOOTING) Well, well, well. Apparently ese -brah here is throwing down. -Are you rolling or running, dawg? -What? You mean I'm competing against this little squirt? Is there a problem, dawg? Then let there be shred. He's lost his mind. He did say he was sick. I hope you enjoyed yourself there, because in addition to pain, you're gonna be humiliated, too. Good luck. (SPARSE APPLAUSE) Cool. That was so awesome! Whatever. (CHEERING) Bring it. SNAKE: Oh, my God! Who is that little dawg? That's my brother. How come you never told me about your micro-brah, babe? Maybe because we've never actually talked before. Oh, sha. Now it's on, brah. Good. Oh, my God! Yes! Pack it in, squirt. I know what you got left, and it's called nada. Woo! ALL: Oh! RILEY: Way to go, Luke! You rule! You're the man, Luke. You were so awesome. You were unbelievable, dude. Hey, Tinker-brah! Fire hither and share some skin with your new peeps in the Pound, huh? BOY: Yeah. What are you doing? Poodle-pup, just relax, all right? Micro-maestro is rolling with the big dawgs now, you fluid? Yo, it's cool, dawgs. I'll catch you guys on the flip side. -Yeah! -I told you this kid is... What the heck? Forget him. Let's just get out of here. Welcome to my Pound, brah. What are you talking about? Well, I'm talking about the L-dawg here flying the colors and living the code, babe. -He's 11. -So what? -So? -So you're too young. You shouldn't even be here. Why aren't you with your friends? Why aren't you with yours? Hey, hey, guys, just let there be chill, all right? It's never too early to start living the three "N's," my friend. -What's that? -Well, that's "hangin'," "ridin'" -and "partyin'." -(ALL WHOOPING) -That's all you guys do? -SNAKE: Sha! We do other stuff, too. Like... Videoing ourselves ridin' and watching it while we party! What's up, dawgs? Where are your friends, brah? What? You're my friends. Wow. I hate to see how you treat your enemies. What are you talking about? Are you kidding? First, you ditch us. And then when we finally catch up with you, you blow us off. But Snake called me over. Well, whoop-dee-doo. -Come on. -Fluid, brah, fluid. Where'd you learn how to skateboard like that? You said you'd never been in a bowl, yet you've been flying and twisting around like you've been doing it forever. It's hard to explain. No, it's not, Luke. It's called lying. I didn't lie. Come on, guys, you gotta believe me. It's too late for that, dude. You're on your own. A.J., it's your turn. I got a bonus. RILEY: Oh! RILEY: Yo, you up? A.J.: (YAWNING) I am now. RILEY: Where's Luke? A.J.: Dude, you just woke me up. How should I know? Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Gotta stay in shape for soccer. What's the matter? Nothing. I'm all right. You're not upset 'cause you're such a big dork, are you? Look who's talking. Yeah? So what happened? I thought you were at A.J's. Remember this? Sure. Pinky swear. I swear to you I'm going to tell you the truth, Di. Okay? You know my Ted Williams card? It's worth a lot of money. And if I'm lying, you can have it. Okay, you've got my attention. So what's up? I've been living the same day again and again for I don't know how long. Today? I'm actually dying to go to school, even if I can't go to the bathroom for two years or get face-flushed by Meat. -Where you going? -To get your Ted Williams card. Fine. Have fun today. Running with the Dawg Pound, living the three N's. Irie, sha. Have you been spying on me? No, but I've seen you at the skate park at least 100 times. Come on, Di, you gotta believe me. Come on! Luke, this is crazy. I know, I know. Please, give me a chance. All right. Prove it. Okay. Hey, man! Yeah. How's it going? Two words. Purple thong. (CROWD LAUGHING) -MAN: It's okay. -(MUFFLED) Ew! Yellow balloon. KID: Mommy, my balloon! Triple fives. WOMAN: Oh, that's it. MAN: The winner, triple five. Pink pig. GIRL: The pink pig. Big hug. (SQUEALING IN EXCITEMENT) That was pretty random, don't you think? Here, take one. -Thanks. -You're welcome. (DIANA READING) MEAT: Get out of my way, kid. Hey, Meat. Or should I say Melvin? -(LAUGHING) Who's Melvin? -Shut up! Who told you that? Hey, back off or the whole middle school will know by second period tomorrow. Okay. Take it easy, kid. My name's not "kid." It's Luke. Luke Malloy. Okay, Luke. Be cool. Sure. Practice this, and your secret's safe with me. up and going in a snap. Can't believe the Net, dude. Okay. I'll be watching, Melv. Okay. So how am I doing? -Can I keep Ted Williams? -Yeah. A water? Fry? At this point, I'd rather gnaw on my arm than eat another French fry or drink another soda. Well, that officially removes my last shred of doubt. How'd you get yourself into this? I wished for it. -Why? -Why not? I didn't want summer to end. (SCOFFS) That's it? Or school to begin. I mean, you've been through middle school. Yeah. And? It's just gonna be so much different. So many new kids, which changes the whole friendship thing. And where being cool matters more than if you've been best buds forever. Are A.J. and Riley acting like you're not cool enough? Or too cool. Depends on the day. Why do you think A.J. and Riley will suddenly care about your, um, degree of coolness? You told me they would. Oh! I was just winding you up. I know, but it happened. What do you mean? Audrey and Stephanie? -We're still friends. -Not like you were. I see them every day. And when I tell them you're at the skate park, they give each other this look like you've moved on. And that's what I'm afraid of. You're such a dork. Well, thanks for the pep talk. But you're a cool dork, Luke. You're either cool or you're a dork. How can you be a cool dork? Well, you're honest with yourself, to your buddies, even with me. That sounds like the dork part. No, that's the cool part. Being my little brother is the dork part. -So if I were you, I would just quit worrying... -Hey, Luke. ...and go for it. Like with that girl that just walked by. Who? You mean Alice? You like her, don't you? She's okay. Well, have you told her she's okay? I think she knows. So you've been repeating this day over and over and you still haven't told her? -Hey, it's not easy. -Well, exactly. But you know what? Girls love to be told that stuff. Even if they're being told by cool dorks? Especially if they are. What's the matter? This is great, Di. Really. It's just... I'm afraid I'll wake up tomorrow and have to do it all over again. Well, maybe it'll be different this time. You've already changed my day. Now, go change yours. MOLESKY: Have fun and enjoy the rest of the exhibit. -Mr. Molesky? -Yes. Uh, not to be too much of a brown-nose moth, but I'm really looking forward to class tomorrow. And, actually, it's a brown-tail moth. I know, I'm just baggin' on you. Pulling your chain. Busting your chops. I'm kidding, dude. Good one. Good one. I'll see you in class. -Hi, Alice. -Hey. It's just me. Oh, then what are you doing here? I like butterflies. There's just something about them that makes me feel good. I know what you mean. I heard about the release tomorrow. Bet that will be cool, huh? I can't wait. Don't be nervous about the butterflies, they like you. Oh, it's not the butterflies on the outside, it's the butterflies on the inside. Talent show, huh? No. Well... There was another reason I came in here. Because I want to see you. And tell you that I'm really glad that we're in the same class this year. Me, too. Really? Cool. Well, see you. Good luck. * I'm a cool dork, I'm a cool dork * I'm a cool dork, I'm a cool dork I'm a cool dork * Make some room, make some room * (UPBEAT SONG PLAYING) * I'm a cool dork * Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool dork Oh, yeah * Fifteen minutes until show time.

For the first time in a long time, I'm ready to rock. Uh! Whatever works. MAN 1: Yo, a little help, please. -The problem is... -Thanks. ...I won't be around to find out. See? Harvey. See what? (TUBAS PLAYING) You never said your cousin was a tuba prodigy. I didn't even know there was such a thing. Oh, man. Ooh! (BICYCLE BELL RINGING) Hey. Hey. Thanks for teaching me the secret. I can really do it now. -You remember? -Sure. What's the matter? Remember how you felt before you could ride? Yeah. That's how I feel now. Well, keep pedaling. Right? Right. See you. Yeah. (CHEERING) Well! You got to feel a little sorry for the act that has to follow that terrific trough of tuba talent. (LOLA LAUGHING) Next up, Steel Monkey! Great job. Is that steel, like in the metal, or, like, steal like in ripping something off? (LAUGHING) Well, gotta go back to my cave. What are we gonna do? -I don't know, but we can't play without... -Let's go, guys. Where the heck have you been? Freaking out. But then I remembered we're in this together, right? ALL: Steel Monkey rules! Here we go. (FEEDBACK SQUEALING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Oh, man. (FEEDBACK SQUEALING) MAN: There we go, buddy. There you go. MAN: Let's hear it! WOMAN: Let's go! -Go, Luke! -Here we go, kid. You got this. Come on, guys. Let's go! Luke! You can do it! -Go, Luke! -Yeah.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING) (LAUGHING) This the greatest or what? This is the best day ever. (SCREAMING) (AUDIENCE GROANING) Hey, look who's up. Here, drink this. Special treat. I didn't shake it up. That would not have been kind, although it definitely would have been random. Anyway, I have to go meet Audrey and Stephanie. Thanks. How you feeling, sweetheart? A little drowsy. Today is... Your last day of summer. (SIGHS) Of course, it's everyone else's first day of school. The festival? It's over? Yeah, you certainly ended it with a bang when that chipmunk came down and landed on your head, and then you fell off the stage... We performed? Well, you really did bang your head. You guys were the hit of the show. You don't remember that? Wow. You've got some visitors here, if you're up for it. Sure. Come on in, boys. -Not too long, okay? -Yes, Mrs. Malloy. -Hey. -How you doing? Good. Actually, great. By the way, Alice told me to tell you hello. -What's up with that, dude? -Back off, man. He has a head injury. We'll give him grief later. (LAUGHS) You won't believe what happened at school today. RILEY: It was amazing. I'm walking down the hall, I'm looking for our classes, and I accidentally bumped into this very large dude. He was huge! -With a lot of facial hair. -And nasty teeth. Dude definitely stayed back a couple of years. Yeah. But I accidentally knocked down his books and the dude looks at me like... He's definitely gonna die. But before he says anything... Or kicks his butt. ...guess who comes to my rescue? Meat. -He's psychic. -How'd you know? Wild guess. Well, anyway. He tells the guy to chill and, of course, he does, and he helps me pick up the books. It was nice, but so random. Very. Then after that I saw Sorenson and she asks me where I'm going. And he says, "Well, the opposite way that you're going." And then she said, "Well, I'm sorry, "because we have all the same classes together." Then he says, "What'd I do to deserve this?" Then she said, "Let me think. "Remember the time we were on the Ferris wheel, "and you, like, talked about how..." (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
