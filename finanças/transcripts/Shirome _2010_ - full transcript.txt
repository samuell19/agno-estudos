THE URBAN LEGEND OF SHIROME Somewhere in an abandoned ruin, it is said that a god able to grant wishes resides Within this place is an ominous drawing of a butterfly If one were to stand in front of this picture and chant the words "Shirome, Shirome, grant my request"... ...and that request were pure of heart, then the god would turn their dream into reality However... If one were to make a wish in ridicule or without purity... ...then the god, in anger, would reveal it's white eyes... ...and drag the victim, to hell This is "Momoiro Clover", a 6-piece group commonly known as "MomoClo" Formed in May 2008, they began playing shows in the streets, gradually building their reputation... ...and gaining popularity. Whilst attending school, they held live shows on weekends And began to refer to themselves as the "Weekend Heroine's" After a couple of member changes... ...they decided on their current line-up in July 2009 In August of the same year, they signed with an Independant label... ...and released their first single, "Momoiro Punch", which debuted at number 11 in the charts Following this they released their second single in November... ...entitled "Mirai e Susumu" ("Advance to the future"), which climbed to number 6 in the Oricon charts In May 2010, they finally released their first major single "Iku Ze! Kaitoushoujo" ("Go! Phantom Thief Girl"), that reached the top spot in the Japanese charts They are now aiming to appear on the famous gameshow, "The Red and White Song Battle" at the end of the year This film was to be shown as a satellite broadcast But due to unforeseen circumstances, its release was delayed And has now been re-edited It has been speculated that the "Weekend Heroines", Momoiro Clover are cursed All of the answers, will be shown in this film (2nd June, 2010 - Dance Studio) Reni, turn a little more this way...that's it. And bring your hands down in front of you - Hey girls - Hey! (The Director is explaining the plans for a TV appearance) OK everyone, you all did a great job on getting your first number 1 single... ...so to celebrate, we're gonna be making a TV special about Momoiro Clover for cable Yay! Awesome! So here's what we're gonna do... - Wait, let's do a drumroll! - Yeah! 1,2,3 - (drumroll) - What the hell? - Eh? "TV Entertainment Survival MomoClo Special - Ghost Hunting" Well, what do you think girls? Let me explain what's gonna happen... (And so filming commences) For this programme, we're gonna focus on an Urban Legend, so we want you to go to an abandoned ruin Does anyone know about the legend of "Shirome"? - Ah, you've heard of it? - Yeah (The theme of the programme is the Urban Legend of Shirome) You know it? How? I heard from a friend at school. I don't know if it's true but I heard it has really white eyes - A person with white eyes? - Yeah, white eyes Is it a god? Have you heard anything else about it? I heard it grants you a wish for you Like Akari said, it's a god that makes your wishes come true But, about the white eyes, this is an ominous sign from the god The scary part is that, even if you make a wish, if it's not pure of heart, then the god will drag you away What?! No way! I don't know much about Shirome myself So we've got someone to come here and explain it more clearly to you - I've got shivers going down my spine! - Don't say that! What's happening?! No!!! I'm so freaked out! - This is too much! - Let's sing!!! Greetings My name is Kyoujin Yoshida, and I'm a ghost storyteller In Japan, we are blessed with many derelict buildings and abandoned ruins In particular, in the Kanto region... ...it is said that some ruins exist, with drawings of butterflies on the walls, but who drew them remains a mystery There, a god named "Shirome" resides within "Shirome" is able to make any wish become reality And if you stand in front of the butterfly drawing and say, with vigour... "Shirome, Shirome, grant my request" three times... Then the legend tells that your desire will come to be If that desire is pure of heart, your words will be heard However, if there is doubt in your heart, you will be taken by "Shirome" "Taken" means, you might become a missing person, be involved in an accident, commit suicide... ...or maybe you will simply, lose your mind About four years ago, an unfortunate case occurred In a countryside town in the Kanto district, there lived two Junior High School friends - Midori and Aki The two of them were the bestest of friends But one day, it was decided that Aki would be moving away to Hokkaido Naturally they were extremely depressed, but they decided that, no matter where they were, they would always be best friends As the day of Aki's departure grew nearer... ...they decided, one day, to travel to the next town, after hearing a rumour about "Shirome" living in the ruins there Of course, their desire was to be friends forever, even though separated When it became nightfall, they secretly left their homes and set off to the ruins And yet, no matter how much time passed or how late it became, they never returned home When their parents realised their daughters were missing, they frantically called their classmates Some of their friends said that they had gone in search of some ruins Their parents went to the next town to the ruins It was terribly dark, and inside this wide building, they yelled... "Midori?! Aki?!" They searched high and low for their daughters, but all they could hear was the sound of their own footsteps on the floor Soon after, they came to a long corridor, again with their footsteps echoing Suddenly, they stopped in front of a sliding door One of them put their hand on it, like this... ...and pulled it open Just after, in the faint darkness, with the room becoming wider... ...they thought they could feel a strange presence around them They steadied their eyes and gazed into the distance... The parents screamed in horror In front of them, from the top of the room, were two jump ropes hanging from a windowframe, at the end of which... ...were Midori and Aki's necks Their parents quickly cut them down, but their bodies had already turned cold But the other strange thing was, they were covered from head to toe in scratches and bruises Just like that, it seemed as if they'd attacked each other On a wall close by, was a black stain in the shape of a butterfly I myself, checked the newspaper on whether this whole story was true, and made this discovery This is an article reporting on two Junior High School girls commiting suicide Additionally, after this case, other people started dying at the same place Inside the ruins, three people committed suicide by inhaling poisonous gas Lastly, about a year and a half after this... ...another girl entered the same building alone This article reports on how she fell to her death In short...In short, during these last four years... At the same building, at the very same ruins The death toll has risen to six...risen to six people... Excuse me Mr. Yoshida? Woah! Are you OK? Stop filming! He needs some tissues! Clean this up! Bring a cloth! A cloth! Get a bucket too! Let's go outside, Mr. Yoshida - Is it alright to stop filming? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry umm... Shall we go downstairs, girls? We're gonna move to the next studio I wanna go home! - Is it OK to move to the first floor? - Yes, that's fine. I'm really sorry about this (40 minutes later, filming resumes) OK, take a seat girls - Ah man! - Just like always - I'm cold - It's freezing! Really sorry about that little accident back there So, about tomorrow's schedule... (The following Day's schedule is being explained by the director) I'll explain what we're going to do We'll be leaving Shinjuku tomorrow afternoon, it'll take about two hours... ...to get to the ruins Is this the place from the story before? Yeah, the place where the two Junior High School girls... - So, we're going to the actual place tomorrow? - Right What?! When we arrive, we're obviously going to get you to go inside And try and find "Shirome" Of course, when you're searching, you'll need to find a picture of a butterfly So try and find where it is When you find the picture, we want you to do something there (The girls are being given a mission) But before that, we'd like you to do an additional task - We want you to sing there - Eh? Seriously?! Which song?! (The mission is to sing at the ruins) At the ruins?! Could we even perform properly? We want you to sing and dance there After the song, we'd like to film you praying... We'd like for you to do this together, but the purpose of the visit is to wish for one thing (And so...) The wish is, well, you know right? To appear on the "The Red and White Song Battle 2010" show Right. So, in summary, you'll be praying to "Shirome", to get you on that show (In order to appear on "The Red and White" show, the girls will make a wish to "Shirome") No problem I think if you all have pure feelings about wanting to go on the show, the wish will become true - I think you all want to appear on it, right? - Yeah! And would you sell your souls to the devil to go on the show? Huh? - Would you even sell your souls... - If we did that we couldn't go on it! No, no, if you could sell your soul and appear on the show, would you? Would we survive?! Yes, if you could survive too... Ah, well in that case, yeah! "Shirome, Shirome, grant our request, make Momoiro Clover appear on the Red and White Song Battle show!" Ok well, that's all for tomorrow's schedule Also, if each of you can face the camera and talk a little about your experiences today... ...and about your expectations for the shoot tomorrow, that would be great - Is that OK? - Yeah, OK - Ah man, they're leaving already! - Don't go! (During the comment and feedback filming, another strange occurence happens...) I honestly don't wanna do this! But because all of MomoClo want to go on the show with pure hearts... ...I think Shirome will definitely grant our request! I'm gonna do my best! I've seen stuff about haunted places on TV before, but I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd actually go to one! But I'm gonna do this, so we can get on the "Red and White Song Battle"! I really don't agree with doing this show But... I'm gonna face Shirome without fear, and make our wish come true! I don't know why we have to go to these ruins! It's unbelievable, isn't it?! But...argh, I don't wanna do it! Everyone seems a little tense, so how about we do the "Kyu, kyu, kyu, kyu" song? - You don't want to? - Seriously?! Alright, OK I take care of my skin, rub, rub rub, rub! So Arin's cheeks are squishy, squishy! Squishy, squishy? Bouncy, bouncy right?! - Bouncy, bouncy... - Ah, you're all too quiet! That was rubbish! I'm worried we're gonna bring a ghost or something back with us We've already had weird things happen before during concerts - I told Shiori about my head getting grabbed by something during a live, remember? - Yeah Seriously, this kind of thing...you can't see it but you can feel it I know something is gonna come back with us. I hate this feeling! I won't be able to sing! It's ok, just do your... I hate this! What's happened? Seriously, I really don't need this! Are you OK? I've had enough of this! Listen, before you go in, we've hired two priests to perform an exorcism at the ruins They're going to accompany you and give you amulets for protection I don't care! I don't wanna go! The spirits there are definitely come back with me, definitely! This sucks so much! - What are we gonna do about tomorrow?! - Here, we've got the amulets I can't do this! Take them, girls OK, let's go tomorrow then, hey? I don't wanna do this! - Let's take a break for now - OK Turn it off, Furuya How is it? Can you take it back? (The frightened girls are calmed down) (Filming then resumes) Well, here we are! So, erm... (To create atmosphere for the programme, the girls are staying overnight in the studio) We've been told by the staff... ...that we unfortunately have to stay overnight here I wanna go back to the other room I know, right? Let's go to sleep quickly! Alright, but before that... - First up, Momoka! - Hey! If I fall asleep, I can forget everything, so let's get to bed! OK! - Arin! - Hey! I wanna...yeah, I'm kind of tired so... - ...I'm gonna go to sleep quickly too - OK! Akari, you're already... Well, erm... You can ignore me if you want but... ...I feel like I'm being watched Are you being serious? - Is something here? - Quit it, seriously You suck! I'm going to sleep! Hey! Wait a second! Grab your amulet then! It's just because I've been feeling really weird since before - Anyway, I'll do my best - Let's all do our best Takagi-san! Don't pretend you're asleep! You haven't said anything yet! I dunno what to say so I'll just go to sleep OK, Shiori! Save me Kanako! I'm scared too! Let's go to sleep together Yeah, don't let go of me, OK? Kanako, give it here Your turn Kanako! What should I say? If I sleep holding onto Shiori the whole time, I think I'll be OK Yep, I'll protect you! What?! It's the other way around isn't it?! - I've got to make sure the amulet's next to my pillow - Yeah, keep hold of it OK, everyone get in the shot! - I still feel like I'm being watched - Quit it already! Yeah, stop it Akari! Isn't it just 'cause of the camera? - It's coming from where Reni is - Seriously? - It's not the camera, It's like it's above... - Like it's all around you? You're creeping me out. Stop going on about it - It's not filming is it? - Yeah, it's still going Let's go! 1...2...Goodnight! See ya! (The next day) Hello!

We are the idols you can meet anytime, the "Weekend Heroines", Momoiro Clover! Nice to meet you! OK! We're now heading towards the place where, according to the legend, Shirome is said to live Right?! - I was just forgetting about that! - Me too! I don't wanna go! But, because it is said that when you make a wish to Shirome with a pure heart, the request is granted... ...and because our aim is to appear on the 'Red and White Song Battle', we want to make this dream come true! - Let's do our best! - Let's do it! Alright. So anyway, last night we were suddenly told by the staff that we had to stay in the lesson studio Yeah, we had to! How was it? Well, Akari heard something weird, didn't you? You're always saying that! You were going on about it before we went to bed! I don't know why, but I was kind of half asleep and half conscious And I heard this 'Patapata' sound, almost like footsteps, circling around me Hang on, hang on. What do you mean? (A sound similar to footsteps was heard last night) Well, at first I was like "Huh? Did I really hear that?" - So it sounded like footsteps? - Yeah Then, well...I thought I'd scare you all so I didn't say anything but... ...in my dream, well I don't even know if it was a dream but... ...there were white eyes on the ceiling What?! Really? On the ceiling, there were a lot of white eyes, kinda like needles (White eyes were seen on the studio ceiling) How do you mean? - So... - Hey, so did it feel like you were in a really wide, open area? Not really a wide area, just on the ceiling, you know, of the studio - And they were open, like this...all over the place - I saw it! It was crazy! So, I don't know where I was but it was like I was in a huge, open space (Another person too...) - And there were white eyes there? - Yeah, like lots of them everywhere (During a dream, lots of white eyes are seen) Yeah! Ahh! Quit it, I'm scared! (The girls will shortly arrive at the ruins where Shirome is said to be) OK, everyone - We'd like you to wear blindfolds until we get to the ruins, if that's OK - What? Blindfolds?! - So you mean we won't know what kind of place it is? - Right Until right before we go in? Seriously?! He's handing them out? OK, put your masks on everyone! It's too dark - Is that you, Akari? - This is creepy! Keep them on until we get there, girls Watch out, there's a step here Yeah, just one step and then you're on the ground Then slowly walk straight ahead My breath... Alright, you're all now standing in front of the ruins We're gonna count to three, and then everyone take off your masks at the same time I'm so freaked out! I don't know what to do! OK! 1,2, take your masks off! Waaaah! What the hell?! - No way! - It's a school? Yes, a school No way, no way, no way! I'm going home! We're in the schoolyard, aren't we? - No way, no way! - I'm scared even now! There's definitely something here. I've been to a place like this before - Really? - Don't say that! I hate this! So, right here, during the last 4 years, 6 people have died - Argh! - I don't want to know, I don't want to know! Like you were told yesterday, in this very spot, 6 people have lost their lives Because the 6 of us are all together, I'm gonna do my best and go inside... ...then we can find Shirome and make our wish to get on the 'Red and White' show I'm gonna do my best Erm, so I... argh, this really sucks. I wanna go home right now but... ...we really want to get on the show, so I'm gonna do my best Well, all I can think about is going on the show so, I'll go in with everyone else I hate this... I really don't wanna go in but, our desire to get on the show is stronger... ...so I'm gonna do this for everyone I just want to get this over with and then we can all go home I'm ready I'm gonna do my best and just hope I don't get possessed or anything I'm gonna come back having gotten us on the show OK girls, I'm going to introduce you to the two experts who'll be assisting you today Spiritualists Mrs. Sou Yuuko and Mr. Kamishima Kenjiro Please (Two spiritualists join the group) Nice to meet you Go ahead, Mrs. Sou Well, I'm Sou Yuuko Mmm, there is no doubt in my mind that something terrifying lies inside the walls of this building Like a supernatural kind of aura, you know... My name is Kamishima Kenjiro. I'm a spiritual exorcist This really is not a safe place If your senses are strong, then you will understand Take a look at that pine tree You can see that it's already half-withered - I can feel the energy of a curse, which consequently is draining the life from it - Woah, he's right! - Why, why, why?! - Creepy! Not cool! Why is it only happening there? It's very important that you all tense up your bodies and focus (Firstly, behind the school building, a spiritual purification cermony will be performed) Look at that. Not good! - Waaah! Desks?! - Now I'm freaked out Now, let us begin the spiritual ceremony We have finished. You may open your eyes Alright, so just to recap, the people that will be entering the building, are of course, Momoiro Clover Also, Mrs. Sou, Mr. Kamishima and the necessary staff members will go in too We also have a very special guest here today... ...that I'd like to call in. Just wait there a moment Take a look over there It's alright, it's alright It's OK! I hate this! I seriously don't wanna do this! No way, no way, no way! Calm down girls Shall we go back over there? - Do we have to listen to him again?! - It's OK, he just going to talk I don't wanna listen! We're scared! I don't wanna listen! - This is a special guest... - Who is this man? I haven't heard anything about this Ah, sorry about that It's just for a surprise in the show. Like you and Mr. Kamishima... But I can feel that this man's aura will aggravate whatever is inside here This doesn't bode well I think it would be better for everyone if he went home This man hasn't been purified yet, has he? - No, he hasn't - Hmm... I don't know whether this is to make the programme more interesting but... ...this is absolutely outrageous Well, erm...it's not to make it more attention-grabbing... ...this is Mr. Yoshida by the way, but he's brought us some new information This man is easily possessed People have a predisposition to many things But the true nature of this man, and I'm sorry to say this because he's right here... ...is that he is a man that can be easily controlled by evil I really think it's best for him to leave I'm sorry but we really have to get going with filming So I think we should have everyone listen to this story first After that, we can...erm... You really should have told us about this before I'm really sorry Sorry but we have to keep going Well, thankyou. I'm ghost story-teller Yoshida Kyoujin You all heard afew days ago about Midori and Aki - The two Junior High School girls - I don't wanna hear! Well, the place where they comitted suicide is actually a classroom in this abandoned school "Which classroom was it?", I hear you ask Well, I spoke today directly with one of Midori's cousins and we recorded the interview Seeing this will be of great benefit to you all If you'd please look this way They recorded this today, girls (Featuring the cousin of one of the girls who committed suicide...) I don't wanna see! I hate this! (...a video of the interview with him is being brought out) Well, excuse me But this may be a little shocking for you all - No way - I'm not gonna watch Nice to meet you You too Tell us about your relationship to Midori OK...She's my, um, Midori's my cousin My mum's younger brother's kid We used to see each other during the Summer vacation and at New Year's Day and we used to do things like play trump together, we were very close Just before she died, we met at a relative's wedding Like always, she was bright and cheerful and she definitely didn't look like she was contemplating suicide I honestly couldn't believe it when I found out she'd done that We heard about what happened to the girls through one of your friends but... ...you haven't spoken about this to anyone else, have you? That's right The other day, it was the anniversary of her death And while I was praying at her grave... ...three of her classmates came to do the same We spoke with each other a little And everyone said the same thing... That Midori and also Aki, never showed any signs of wanting to end their own lives Hearing this, I wanted to know more So the girls told me where the school and the classroom was and in the evening I went there by myself Sorry...erm...There was a broken window on the first floor and using my flashlight, I got through it So I set off for the classroom at the end of the corridor on the second floor The corridor was long and there was something not right While I was walking, I heard a strange kind of 'bash, bash' sound And it felt like there was some sort of presence watching from above Lastly, I heard a 'pata, pata', as though someone was walking right next to me I was really scared I wondered whether it was Midori, calling for me Then, I heard the footsteps going towards the classroom on the second floor I opened the door and... And? Mr. Murai? Yeah, I'm OK, sorry...erm... In the classroom, did you find a butterfly pattern? Butterfly? Yeah, there was Can you continue? Yeah...sorry, erm... I'm so sorry So, I opened the door, and went in As I did, there was...there... Are you OK?! Sorry, sorry...what the...what the hell was that? What was that? - It seems as though it was a kind of poltergeist - Poltergeist? That movement...it looked like he was floating... An evil spirit I feel that it came solely to attack Midori's cousin Anyway, like he said There is no doubt that the classroom where the suicide took place, and where Shirome resides is none other than the second floor classroom Which end of the second floor it is, we still...we still don't know... In this building...? Yes, which end of the corridor it is Wait... Are you alright? What did I tell you?! He's been taken. He's possessed - What the hell?! - Let go! No way! No way! Stop filming! Furuya, get Katou over here! I'm out of here! You can't! If you go, we can't finish the programme I want the exorcists to make sure it's safe one more time The God of Mercy now protects you through your amulets Alright? There are now Sanskrit characters written inside The top one is the God of Mercy He protects you now It's alright. We'll be with you It's OK, it's OK (At long last, at the School Ruins where Shirome lives...) (...the girls finally go inside) OK, well, I think we're now going to enter the building We'll try to film as much as we can so we can tell the world about this It's open Everyone! - Let's do our best - OK Lets do this - Alright, go on in - OK We should go in one at a time, right? It stinks! Alright, can we have Ms. Sou and Mr. Kamishima come to the front? Can you feel anything in here? I can sense something this way Well, shall we take a look up there? This is scary! What's happening? Did you hear that sound? It's guiding us there, isn't it - I hope not - I don't think we should go Wasn't it just a cicada? It was the sound of a spirit It's inviting us in I don't wanna go - Go slowly. Tell us if you sense anything dangerous, Souda - OK He's going by himself? Crap! No way, No way, No way, I'm serious! - Why is it... - Didn't you just look there? What was that?! This sucks! Please, let's stop! Stop! Stop! STOP! There's no point searching for anything, it's a poltergeist OK, well, let's just keep moving I hate this! Help me! Help me, help me What's that sound? Please stop! Stop it! Stop it! - Enough! - Why aren't we moving? Was that the wind? That door was shaking It was the wind!!! Definitely the wind!!! Just the wind... Woah! Quit it, seriously! - Stop, please - I just wanna get out of here! - Quit it! Seriously! - Is it even this way?! Argh!! I wanna get out of here Stop it now! It's from over there, isn't it? That sound... - Let's go back! - That's really strange, isn't it... What should we do? - It's coming from that door... - From here? I can feel a presence there OK, can someone open it...the door? Alright Kanako, try and open it It's OK, it's OK - It's OK - It was just something in the way - I jumped! - It's OK My heart stopped! It's shaking - Something's shaking - Sorry, that was me No, no, no...look at the light Yeah, you're right Look at this, why is it shaking? Hmm, shaking Let's check everyone's here!

It's still shaking, look There's no butterfly - No butterfly, huh? - I'm scared! What IS this room? - Doesn't it look like a principal's office? - Yeah, kinda That photo looks like it's a principal Sorry for the intrusion - Sorry about this, we won't be long - We're just looking for something I can't tell exactly what it was, but I can feel that some kind of spirit was definitely here It feels to me like it's hiding somewhere - Looks sticky... - It's over there too It's right above us aswell It's on the sofa, too I think it may well be in this room This is creepy! - There's something moving over there - I saw it! - There! Right there! - It was there! - Where? - There! - There's something moving over there - I saw it! - There! Right there! - It was there! - Where? - There! It went up into that corner over there It's going to the second floor, maybe to return to it's original form It's stopped, the shaking Yeah, it has! I wonder how It's stopped... The storyteller before, he told you about a classroom on the second floor, didn't he? - Shall we go up? - Uh-huh, let's go Sorry for disturbing you There they are, the stairs, on the left Was that the wind? The wind, just the wind What's that? What is it? There's something... ...there's a barricade here - A barricade?! - I dunno! Not only that, there are some decorations up there that bring bad luck This looks like it's cursed... - Mmm, there's all kinds of cursed relics here, huh? - Yes, absolutely - Can we get through? - Put the light on it This is...I don't even know what to call it - There, in the trashbag... - Yeah, there's something in it - Is that something soaked in formalin? - I dunno Dead flowers too Here, too. Dead flowers here too And this...it looks like egg or something This is worse than that white stuff we saw downstairs Don't touch this, I've a feeling it may collapse and fall Be careful - Let's go down - Slowly, slowly! Watch your step - There's nothing but corridor this way - Shall we try this way? Was it 1996? 1996? - I was born that year - Yeah... Akari? We're now in a place where the curse is very strong It's so dark The stairs are worse here than the other ones Are we going up? Let's just get to the bottom of the stairs for now - That made me jump! - What the hell?!

I have here a holy chime. Listen closely As long as you can hear this sound, our energy will protect you OK... Rely on this sound to guard you, and keep moving forward - Alright - I'm not gonna cry Let's do our best We're not gonna cry "The shining stardust lights up the darkness" "Without hesitation, we can go on" "Like a shining arrow flying in the wind" "I believe in my friends. Friendship is all around us" "The sign that can show us the way shines in my heart" "Without looking back, we keep pushing on" "We can go" "Let's swear on our lives, with righteousness in the depths of our hearts" "Now let's fly the dreams we have for tomorrow here" "Whatever we come up against, we can surely face" It's alright, it's clear up ahead The chime's still ringing. Keep going - Remember, we promised we wouldn't cry! - Not gonna happen! - Don't worry, hold my hand tight - It's alright Hey, I can't hear the chime What happened to the chime? Mr. Kamishima? Wait! It's alright, he's definitely back there somewhere Woah, that's the same thing as before, isn't it? - It looks like a doll - I don't think it's safe here - Doesn't look safe - Well...

It's dripping! Did this come from the ceiling? - Weird. This must've come from the butterfly - Definitely I guess there's been some bad wishes made here There's a photo here Found some incense here too And some glasses Chrysanthemums too - Is that a letter? - Woah... "I have a request for Shirome..." What's that? - There's a letter here - "I have a request for Shirome..." "And thus have found my way to his place" "I have a seven year old son who has just fallen ill" "We took him to the hospital, but they found a tumor" They wanted to wish for his recovery, huh?

I wanna perform for everyone! We're definitely getting on it - Let's do our best - Definitely getting on it (26th June, 2010) (The 2nd Anniversary Show) The last thing that was filmed in this programme was extraordinarily bizarre It may well be that for all their success, Momoiro Clover will carry a curse forever That was awesome!
