Father, you're building tens. Oh, yes, building tens. You lucky stiff! You've got big casino again. I have that, my son. Nevertheless, do not forget that I play with the most great reluctance. Yeah, with an extra deck up your cassock. That was oviedo. Flew in my squadron. Take it light, father, take it light. Oviedo never heard that volley. Lead travels faster than sound. Well there's nothing I can touch. Let us stop this foolish game, my son. You know what will happen at five o'clock. Father, where's your tact? You know, I couldn't sleep last night trying to decide what my last words were gonna be when I stand up out there. I sort of wavered between "death to tyrants" and "long live Liberty." But I finally decided to say it with music. What do you think of this? Please, my son. Here in these last few hours, isn't there anything I can do for you? Yes. Give me some better cards. I'm not of your religion, my son. I do not speak your American language very well. But within a few hours, you must face your creator. It is my duty to prepare you. As a volunteer fighting for a cause which, which was not your own, you have shot down seven planes. Seven, my foot! It was 12. Our official communique said 19. My son, examine your heart deeply. Do you find no repentance there? No regret? No regret? You bet I do. Nothing else but. Oh, god be praised. I had one life and what did I do? Wasted it in some palooka preliminaries in Spain, just before Hitler and Chamberlain warm up to the main event. I tell you, those Nazis know how to fly and when I think of the fun I'd have taking pot shots at those monkeys. Let us put aside the question of repentance. There are still other matters, my son. Are there no final instructions you wish to give? No last messages? Well, there's my will. And here's the menu I've drawn up for my last meal. Some green turtle soup, a little squab with some wild rice, bottle of good burgundy. And for dessert, a bubble dancer, served with some soft music in the next cell. Did you ever see a bubble dancer, father? Let us put aside the question of instructions. I wish I were more competent to deal with your situation, my son, you see, I was brought here from the monastery only because I speak English. This is my first execution. Don't worry, father, it's mine, too. Let us play casino. It concerns a pardon. Who's been pardoned? Not so fast, what's he saying? Look, I don't want to intrude, but is this my pardon he's talking about? Yes, my son. An interview was granted by the highest military authorities. Your wife has- my wife? Yes, yes. They have listened to the entreaties of your wife. It is a full pardon. She's waiting for you in the office of the governor of the prison. My wife is waiting in the governor's office? Yes. Let us go at once, my son. Let us go, go, go. Please, go! What a blessed outcome! This is a miracle, my son, a glorious miracle. It's a miracle all right. Now, strictly between you and me, and under the seal of the confessional, I haven't any wife. - Can you see her? - Yes. She's not your wife? You are quite sure? No, never seen her before in my life. Then they sent for you by mistake. Well we had a nice little walk from my cell. We'll have a nice little walk back. Tom, Tom, it's you! Tom, it's you! It's your funny old face. Oh, let me look at you. You look pale. You've lost weight. Oh, darling! Look at him, completely dazed. Darling, don't you understand? You're free, you're pardoned. Your wife is here. Oh, haven't you got a kiss for her? Darling! Oh, darling, it's been so long. One moment, senor Martin. A certain point must be settled. Despite your grave offenses against Spain, senor Martin, my superior has seen fit to show you clemency. He did so because of the pleadings of your wife and also as a gesture of friendship to your native land. Before the pardon will take effect, however, you must give to use your written pledge to leave this country at once and never take up arms against it again. Oh, once he's out of here, he'll never come back, I can guarantee that. You promise, don't you, darling? Me? Oh, sure, sure. We'll have the necessary papers drawn up. Is this your passport, senor Martin? Your photograph? Yeah, looks like it. It says, "Thomas Fuller Martin, born June 22, 1906, Cleveland, Ohio." That's me. It also says, "unmarried." Does it? That's how you got abroad! That's how you managed to enlist! They never would've taken him if they'd known he was married! That's why he did it. Yep, that's why I did it. Oh, Tom! Leaving me in New York in an apartment with back rent, and one child and another one on the way. Tom, I hate you. I hate you! Maybe I shouldn't have come for you, Tom! We'd be better off if they shot you. Oh, no! Senora, senora, he is a young man. When I was his age and engaged, I too ran away to a service in Spanish Morocco. You were engaged, but he was married. When I think of those months, those nights! The tears I've shed. There you are, governor. Now you can see why I ran away. Always crying, always hysterical. Now listen, baby, with you bawling like this, I'm not sure I wouldn't rather face that firing squad. Oh, Tom, you don't love me! Why sure I do. Salvador, bring the prisoner's belongings at once. I'm sure senor and senora Martin are in a hurry to leave. - Oh, thank you. - Pardon, governor. I would prefer not to assist at this scene. Perhaps we had both better go and see whether the papers are drawn up. Yes. Oh, darling! Say, who in blazes are you? Oh, Tom, darling! Be careful, for heaven's sake, if you don't want two people shot instead of one! They might be listening. But what is this? What gives out? You're just doing me a favor. Doing you a favor? I am? I'm Augusta Nash, for the "associated news." I thought it would make a great story. A what? A beat, a headline. Wait a minute! You mean you're pulling this stuntjust- for an exclusive story. Don't you see? A beat. But why pick me? It had to be an American for the American papers. You can see that. Well, sure. You don't mind, I hope. Oh, no, no, no, I'm glad to be of service. Oh, darling! Oh, I'm sorry. I hope we haven't come back to soon. It's quite all right. Yes, I've entirely forgiven her. You have forgiven her after all she has done for you? An amazing girl, my wife. - Amazing! - You will sign here. "Never, under any circumstances, to engage in any activity connected, however remotely, with Spain." Governor, I'm kind of a music lover. Is it all right if! Listen to "Carmen" now and then? Oh, Tom, aren't you cute. May I lend you my car, senora? Oh, thank you, I hired one. It's waiting outside. We're catching a plane for Paris at 2:55. Paris. It's kind of a pleasant feeling being in Paris tonight instead of a pine box. I hope heaven can wait, padre. Your chances of heaven seem remote to me, my son. You have everything, senor Martin? Yes, I think so. I'll leave the playing cards. But have them cleaned before you play with the padre. Has them all marked. Oh, come now, Tom. Thank the governor for everything and tell him you had a lovely time. Well, thank you, governor. Goodbye. Take care of Adolf. Adolf? Yes, I've shared my cell for six months with Adolf. He's a rat, but very smart. I taught him to hold out his paw like that. That'll be enough, Tom. He never knows what he's saying, governor. Goodbye, thank you. - Goodbye, padre. - Goodbye, senora. Goodbye, father. Good luck, my son. You're all right. Fine couple. Good looking, these americanos. A very inventive people, too. Oh yes, Ford, Edison, this bell. Oh, he's left this behind. Addressed to me. Listen to this part, it is interesting. What a man will write when he is about to die. "I hereby devise and decree that my entire monetary estate, consisting of $29.87, shall be distributed among the soldiers of my firing squad, 50 cents going to the drummer and 17 cents to the commanding officer, "with the compliments of the corpse." Light-hearted devil! Incorrigible! "Finally, I direct that there be no melancholy among these, my heirs, as I die an orphan and a bachelor, leaving no parents, no widow, no offspring, and no hard feelings. "Alley-oop, Thomas Martin." If the firing squad learns they've lost this legacy, they'll shoot me! "A bachelor", "no widow!" She's not his wife! I have been tricked! They must be stopped! The telephone! Oh. Give me the captain of the day. Give me the chief of police! Give me the airport! How'd you get away with it? That was all the makeup I needed. Of course, my passport had to be corrected a little. Weren't there millions of guards? How'd you get in? The agitant carried me in to the couch. On the what? Well, after waiting three days in the anteroom for an interview, I had to whip up a faint. Then came a couple of hours crying. Yes, sir. His excellency cried like a baby. I had to blow his nose while he was signing the pardon. That ought to tickle the readers of that... What was the name of that paper you write for? "Associated news." 400 of them, New York to Honolulu. Oh, I tell you what I'll do. I'll subscribe to each one for six months. If you take three subscriptions to each, I could get 400 scooters. Oh now, come on, you don't want me to read three "Wichita gazette's" a day. What kind of church makes a sound like that? That's no church. That's the alarm bell at the prison. What? Oh, don't tell me something's slipped up after all the trouble I've taken! Hey, what's the matter? Every car must stop when the alarm sounds, senor. Why? Oh, regulations. Some prisoner escaped maybe. - We'll never make it by car. - The roads will be blocked! Thought we were going by plane? But the airport will be covered. - Soldiers! - I see them. Hold tight, baby, here we go! There's one! Come on, get in! Oh, my typewriter! Oh, for the love of Pete! Here comes my little prayer. What prayer? Always when I take off. Song of Solomon, chapter 2, verse 13. "Arise my love, my fair one and come away." Hello, back home again! Well, you can sit up, we're out of range. Come on, get up, don't be so scared. - You think I'm scared? - Yeah. Well, I was. I was scared the story was petering out. You know, this comes in mighty handy. I needed a good climax. I'm delighted. You don't know how good the climax is. We've got exactly 47 gallons. This ship gets two miles to the gallon, that's 94 miles. It's 120 to the French border. You mean, we have to land in Spain! Well, if we get a slight tail wind, we may be able to glide the difference. "Gliding twixt life and death." That oughta make pretty good reading, don't you think? Yeah. Oh, I probably would've thought of that, anyway. Did you think of that too? Are they after us? They're not looking for bird's nests. They're pursuit planes! Yep. They'll be up with us in 10 minutes. Say, maybe this is a little too much of a climax! As for me, I'm living on velvet, anyway. - Well, don't stop pitching! - I want to write that story. There's a little cotton wool we can hide in for a while. We hid in the clouds, a sanctuary of whipped cream. Is that the sort of stuff you write, Augusta? Well, why don't you rewrite your name? Augusta! Like talking to a battleship. Well, they call me gusto. Three years I've had a column, "in Paris with gusto." Haven't I seen that some place? It's a fashion column. Flash. "Chiffon makes a comeback." Flash. "Suzanne scoops skunk corset." Don't tell me this story's gonna be what the well-dressed fugitive is wearing! No, sirree. From now on, it's front page features for me. With a by-line. Syndicated and copyrighted! You're not gonna write right now? Well right now is right. I want to be ready for the first French telegraph office we strike. Now, come on. Thomas Martin, what was that middle name of yours? Thomas Fuller Martin, often known as Thomas Fuller, malarkey. I'll bet. What's that for? Just wanted to hear if they're around. You know, with those planes after us and a weak gas supply, we got just about a 50-50 chance of making the border. Do you mind if I write one chance in a thousand? Look, why not be practical? Either we're caught and you've written that for nothing or we land in France and you've got all the time in the world. Well? Well, if it's gonna be our last hour, why not spend it like sensible people. For instance? You might move over and kiss the lobe of my ear. You know, it's funny thing that you of all people should be sitting beside me. You're precisely my type. How long were you in that prison? 10 months. As I was saying, the first girl I was crazy about when I went to Cleveland steelwood high was something like you. Or take Hazel, for instance. Hazel was the air hostess on the commercial line I was flying from fort worth to New Orleans. One night in April, very bad flying weather, no passengers, just Hazel and I. So I lost my commercial license. Well, anyway, what I was trying to say was, she looked an awful lot like gusto. Same hair, same cheekbones. Just what I said, precisely my type. Listen, honey, after 10 months in jail, anything would be your type, a Saint Bernard. No, ever since you kissed me in the governor's office, I've been... yeah, you're just hungry. No, no, it's you. Really it is. You know, there are three ways of approaching a woman, gusto. The first one winds between Rose bushes and forget-me-nots to the song of nightingales. It takes about six months. The second way is all dusty with deep understanding, good fellowship, common interests. That takes about six weeks. But the third way's a shortcut. The last time a man tried a shortcut, I bit his nose! Why, gusto! There they are! Right upstairs. Can they see us? No, all that can happen is when they start swooping, they might dent our fenders. Can it? Oh, can't you do something? Well. Let's go up and say "hello." Put your belt on. - You all right? - Yeah. How are you feeling? Oh, fine. Left my stomach back in the cloud. What's the matter? Are we hit? That's what they think, I hope. Now, if we can only locate your stomach. Don't bother. How soon before they find us? Well, they'll lose a good hour looking for our wreckage down below. Say you're pretty clever, aren't you? That's what I was trying to tell ya! Now, to get back to those three ways, huh? Come on you asthmatic slugs! The train's already in. They're in car 8. Hold it, gusto! Stay where you are, Martin. Come on, boys, step on it! Ready, you squirts? Miss Nash, as European head of the "associated news," it is my privilege to welcome you after an exploit as brilliant as it was daring. You have thrilled the hearts of millions of readers with your story which appeared exclusively through the "associated news" in 400 papers throughout the world. Congratulations, miss Nash. Thank you, Mr. Phillips. I'm glad I was able to do my bit for a fellow American and the "associated news." What you did will go down in the annals ofjournalism, side by side with the story of Stanley's rescue of Livingston. The legend of Tom Martin, the captured eagle, and Augusta Nash, who broke the cage and set the eagle free. Released exclusively by the "associated news." And now let me congratulate you, Mr. Martin. Thanks. We hope your injury to your face is not serious. Oh no, it's nothing, no. Maybe you will tell us all about it? Sure. I ran into an iceberg. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to bow out of this three-ring circus. Miss Nash, thanks. Whatever thanks life is worth. Hey, Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin! What's the matter with him? Cut it, boys. - Mr. Martin! - Tom! Hey, Mr. Martin, over here! - Hey, Tom! - Hello, pink! Shep! Oh, boy, I'm glad to see you. Nice to see you, too. So they didn't get you, after all. I thought you two would have been dead, buried and eaten by Spanish worms, too. How'd you get out of it? Well, they shot us down off the coast, near Barcelona. A British cruiser came along and took us to marseilles. Yeah, and in marseilles there was a vice consul, fella by the name of... hey, hey, isn't that one of my suits? - Yeah, that's right. - So is this too. Yeah, you see, we didn't think you'd have any use for it, so we claimed your trunk. Yeah, we wanted something to remember you by, something that had been very close to ya. How about a couple of pair of shorts? - Oh, yeah. - We're wearing those, too. - Oh, you are, huh? - Yeah. No, no, I'm won't sign this. Come on, you pilferers, let's get out of here. Listen! I'm the one you're writing for. Go away. Now, will kind you tell me why Martin walked out on us? It's just his nose. Nose or no nose, we need that guy. They've telephoned from New York. They're hot for more on him. I wired a thousand words. They want 50,000 and we'd better get it for them. They want a color photograph for their Sunday supplement. They've got to have it. Look, Mr. Martin and I had a slight misunderstanding. He tried a shortcut. Judas h. Iscariot, woman! First you yammer that you want to write something better than that fashion drool. Finally, an idea creeps into that bird brain of yours, you get a break, do you put your teeth in it? I see where they finally found somebody to play Scarlett O'Hara. And it looks like the Yankees in the American league again this year. Say, if we miss that world series again this year, of course, that all depends on the rabbits. Those rabbits! - Those rabbits! - What rabbits? Shep's mother runs a rabbit farm in New Jersey and she promised to send over passage money, that is, if the rabbits cooperate fast enough. Yeah, ma's pretty cute. Hey, listen to this! "And my heart is overflowing with Thanksgiving that you are alive, buddy, darling. "I want so much to see you again." Oh, here it is! "I took your letter out and read it to the rabbits and told them to hurry up so we can see you soon." Nice business. Couple of grown guys walking round and round in the place de la concorde waiting for some rabbits in New Jersey to multiply. You guys want to go home? Honestly? You bet! Back to mama, huh? Back under the old stove like a pair of wet galoshes. Oh, we figured we might hook up with jiggs Jackson. Yeah, he's starting a jerk-water airline out in new Mexico. Sounds like a riot! Why did you come over here in the first place? 'Cause you read a couple of articles on Spain. "Or is democracy is doomed." Because you got all steamed up like a Turkish bath. Because you said that a lot of big guys were kicking the tar out of some little guys, and it wasn't fair and it was up to us to come over and even things up. Take it easy, shep. So that's why we all came over, more or less. Me? I came over because I'm a hero. Flash Gordon, college graduate. Superman flying to the rescue of the shackled senorita with a Rose in my teeth. Aha, right on your best suit! There were 150 of us American flyers. And just because 100 get bumped off, you two want to fold up and go home? What do you want to do? The war's all over. You mean the first round's over. The whole thing, doggone it. You heard what Hitler said over the radio, didn't ya? "I have but three desires in my heart. Peace, peace and peace." And the next day he took czechoslovakia! Tomorrow it'll be Poland, Hungary, Romania! We'll get another crack at those boys. War is coming, I can smell it. Romania. Say, that reminds me, shep. Do you think Tom would go for that Romanian gal on the first floor? I'm not interested. She's got the cutest lisp. She had, but she left yesterday for Bucharest. Oh, she did, did she? How do you know? Well you shut up and stop talking about women! Self control. That's all they think about. They're nothing but a bunch of stuffy, chilly, self-centered. They bore the living bejeebers out of me. I don't want to see one again ever! Hey, what happened to you while you were in prison? Nothing. The desk for you. That's how people get killed. Who? Where? Well, send her up! Yahoo! It's about an interview! Miss Nash has a photographer with her. Hello? Hello? Alright. Room 417. Oh, thanks. Come on, Mr. Botzelberg. Joe isn't here, miss Nash. And I can't photograph without lights. - Well, oh, all right. - Well when he comes 417. 417, always every time he's late for supper. Well, I'll say this for him, you never know. After what happened, I figured she was as about as human as a mermaid on a municipal fountain. Half cast iron and half fish. "Forget it", I said. "Far as I'm concerned, you can sit in that basin 'til your fins rust." So what happens? Then the phones and the mermaid wants to kiss and make up. Just like that. It's that newspaper woman, isn't it? Oh, mind your own business and get out of here! Well, keep your nose down on the turns, both of you. Good fishing, chum. Go ahead. That's a nice pair of fins. Augusta! Come right in, Augusta. This is the pleasantest surprise I've ever had! Well, I might as well tell you, I had to come. You did? There was too much unfinished business between us. That's the way I feel. I've got to know everything about you, every detail. I'm at your complete disposal. You see, it's very important that we get exactly the right picture. Yes, I wish you would. We've had enough misunderstandings. Well let's get down to business. Now? Well there's no use wasting time. What about that light? Don't you think we'd better pull the down shade? Well how about a little drink first? No, I want my mind to be as clear as a bell. Well, a little music? Oh, come on now, Tom. Let's concentrate! Why, gusto! There. You look much cuter like that. Now this has to come off, of course. Why, the swelling's all gone! You know, I want you to look your prettiest. Now let's see. What's the best setup? Now don't be so scientific, gusto. Well what about that chair? Well. Maybe it's a little too conventional. What would you suggest? I'm gonna get that drink. Oh, Tom, I never thought you'd be so coy. Yeah, but this is all a little bit too fast for me. Now you sit right down there. Well I won't like it. You'll love it when you see it in the Sunday supplements. What's been happening in america since I've been in jail. - In full color. - What? - Is this is it, gusto? - Come in, Mr. Botzelberg. Hey, Joe, this is it! Hey, Joe! Joe! Come on! Oh, you're the flyer, the fella who was up in Spain, say, that's some important people today, when you're shootin' up them cameras. That's the moral pride that's in the airplane. We'll leave that for Augusta, I'll take the picture. All right. Who is this oddment? - Well, oh, that's Mr. - Botzelberg, the photographer. Miss Nash! I owe you an apology. I said you were half cast iron and half fish. Well you're all cast iron and all fish! We'll take one profile and one full face. All right, one and that's all you get. Joe, how many times have I told you, we need a place to put the lights. Look at your camera, can't you put it inside. Now, now, now wait. Just the hair. Oh no, no, no. Gusto. Oh, all right. All right. That's the calvary force. We'll try them. That's fine, that will preach. Hold the calvary. Oh, don't forget those airplanes when you're firing up the cossack. This man, it's gonna be the greatest sale of the picture. Now, smile! Let's have a nice smile now. Come on, smile. That's it, lighter force. Pull the calvary airplane. That'll force her. Hold it. That's fine. Now a profile. I said one and that's enough! Now, now. Be a good boy. Come on now, the profile. It'll only take a minute. Now as soon as it's over, we'll get down to a few facts about your life. You know, just an outline. A what? Smile. Let's have a nice, that's it. Hold it. Come on. We can't have you looking like the great stone face. - Come on. - Hold it. That's fine. Now perhaps you ought to take one- that's enough! That'll be enough, Mr. Botzelberg. He's the nervous type. Alright, buddy, that's all, that's all! You old. Full of pictures anyway, they're flying around. Hey, Joe, why don't you watch where you're going. Cameras, take pictures. Every time you, now come on. Let's get ready to. Never mind him. He's crazy. Come on, sit down. Now, about your early life. Any bright childhood setting? My mother was a manic depressive and my father had distinct homicidal tendencies. I shouldn't be surprised. Miss Nash, if you think I'm gonna sit here telling you the very dull story of my very dull life- you were born in Cleveland? Yes, miss Nash. I was born in Cleveland. But tonight I'm in Paris and they have a guillotine here for people who work at this hour. It's eight o'clock. 10 of. All right, it's 10 of. But on the champs elysees, the lights are bursting into bloom, in the great restaurant wines are growing cold, orchestras are limbering up their fingers, and women all set for their rendezvous stand putting perfume behind their ears. And expect me to sit here and tell you what happened to me when I was in diapers? Anything of interest? Miss Nash, have you ever been to Maxim's? Tourist stuff. That sort of place doesn't mean anything to you? Red plush and gilt, women's shoulders, a slow waltz, the fireworks and crepes suzette and a wine card so big you could hide behind it. - L'amour. - Alright, I'amour. I'm devoting my first evening to it. Also my second, my third and my fourth! That's an awful lot of amour. I was in jail an awfully long time. Miss Nash, I reserved a table for nine o'clock. I won't go, Mr. Martin. You won't go! Who invited you? I'm meeting a lady there. Ooh. With perfume behind her ear? Well, as a matter of fact, she's a Romanian. And she's got the cutest lisp. Is that so? All right, Augusta, that's enough. I'm gonna get dressed. I'll come back tomorrow morning. Oh, I'd better warn you. The last time I stepped out in Paris was on a Monday. I didn't get home until Thursday. Oh no, come on, Tom. This is no joke. I have a deadline to meet. And I have to meet life and love with arms outstretched. You know, when we were in that plane, I had a hunch you were a stinker. Now I'm sure of it. Oh, and when I was just about to make a very soft-hearted suggestion. What? Do you know anything about Romanians? Well, they have no sense of time whatever. And the lady I'm meeting tonight is notoriously late, even among Romanians. She always keeps me waiting. Now, if you want to come along to Maxim's I can give you the time until she arrives. I take notes between the plush and the crepes suzette? And when the lady comes, I expect you to run along like a good little girl. Only, run quickly, will you? Don't worry, Mr. Martin. There'll be no Balkan entanglements. Martini? Emil, two martinis. Now, that time when you took off with the hot dog stand mixed up in your landing gear, was that your only serious accident? Except when I broke my legs. Oh, when was that? Well when I jumped off the barn with my mother's umbrella for a parachute. - Oh, that's wonderful. - That goes way back here. I say, rather unusual that, isn't it, darshue? Undoubtedly, your lordship. That a secretary should actually take shorthand in Maxim's. I wonder what they do in the office. What! - Did you ever meet Lindbergh? - No. Pardon, monsieur, but monsieur's table has been ready now for some time. Well, I'm waiting for a lady. Then you will be three? Oh, no. No, no, Mr. Martin's waiting for the feature. I'm the newsreel. Very well, monsieur. Now, you said you never met Lindbergh. Where were you when he made his flight? I was in Canada for a hunting trip. Didn't hear about it for two months. Oh, no, no. No. No, you were in New York. One of the million cheering throats waving flags as he rolled up the Avenue. Right then and there you made your final decision to fly or die, hm? You don't mind a little embroidery? No, no, not a bit. Thanks. Consider the word stinker withdrawn. Chasseur! Get me the flower girl. Gusto. Do you believe in give and take? Within limits. Well how about me asking you a question now? In fact, asking for some advice. Shoot. Well, the lady who's coming, the last time we saw each other, we had quite a bit of a row. Guess it was my fault. She seemed to get the impression that I was abrupt, kind of out of control. Not you. Well, tell me, gusto, you're so smart. How can I erase a footprint that looks as though it was left by a heel? Why, that sounds almost human. Well, you see, I'm crazy about the girl. She's swell, really. Only she's got standards and you know me, I'm kind of heavy handed sort. So and I don't quite know how to handle the situation. The flower girl, monsieur. Oh, thank you. Yes, please. There you are, don't know one from another. What shall I get? Oh, you don't want anything routine. Oh, no. How about that great pile of Jasmine? Those little bits of things? Smell them. Wonderful. Chasseur! - Monsieur? - Put these on my table, - over there, will you? - Oui, oui, monsieur. That's all right. That's all right. Well, let's see. Commercial aviation, stunt flying. Were you ever a test pilot? No, no, that was gable. Say, isn't that your lady? No, mine's much more attractive. Than? And frankly, I don't think that floral tribute is enough to change things. What do you suggest for woman drinks? Well I'm not an expert on alcohol. I remember once, on the lie-de-France, there was a beautiful London doctor. A woman's specialist, oh, and believe me, that's just what he was. He told me I was looking pale and prescribed something for my blood pressure, champagne with a dash of creme de menthe. Any good? After two glasses, I was taking his pressure. Oh, I wanted to be his nurse. I begged him to take my tonsils out. Well, fortunately, a storm came up. Just champagne and creme de menthe? - Emil! - Oui, monsieur. Bottle of champagne some creme de menthe and two glasses. Oui, monsieur. About what proportion? You fill the stem and then a little of the base. Like that. About right? Check on that, will you. Too much mint. More champagne, will you. Fill mine, too. Oh, it's perfect. You try it. Well, here's to your success. Here's to yours. Kind of tickles the spinal cord, doesn't it. Mm, you know, I was thinking, when she comes, after you've dined and danced, why hide behind the wine card? Well, what do you suggest? Change of pace. Take her out of here, out where there's a breeze and some stars. Find an old fiacre and drive up a cobbled street on montmartre. Don't talk. Not a word. Just sit and wait. Count the clop, clop, clop of the horse's hooves on the cobbles. Count to a thousand. And then, possible, nowjust possibly, mind you, kiss her. Chasseur! - Monsieur? - Get me a fiacre and have it wait outside. Of course, you know, the lady being Romanian may loathe horses and despise Jasmine and be made actively ill by creme de menthe. Oh, look, about this dancing, do you think it's absolutely essential? You see, my waltz is bad but my rumba is a public scandal. Oh, just hold her tight and let the music tell you. You wouldn't care to help me brush up a little, would you? Sure, but if she comes? Oh, I'll keep an eye on the door. Okay. Say, you're not bad at all. Yeah? Wait 'til I hit an air pocket. Ask them for a waltz. Any particular one? Well there's an old one I'm crazy about, but I don't think they'd know it. Let's ask. It has a perfectly idiotic title, "dream lover." Do you know an old tune called "dream lover"? "Dream lover"? How does it go? Is this it? Yes, that's right. We call it "ma cherie." They call everything "ma cherie" over here. Do you want some good advice? There's nothing like the sentiment you get from an old song. I've loved this one for years. My big sister's Beau used to sing it. Oh, he had a terrible voice but a lot of feeling. They used to dance out on the porch. There were fireflies in the hydrangea bushes. Wish I knew the words. Well, if! Remember, they were pretty awful. It's 10 o'clock. Is it? Isn't she's late, even for a very late Romanian? Mm-hm. Maybe she isn't coming at all. Maybe. Maybe she doesn't even exist. Maybe. Maybe I walked into a trap. Gusto. Maybe I even helped to build it. Are you sore? You bet I am! We could've had dinner an hour ago! You cheated! I only made it 910. I couldn't wait. Do you mind? No. Hold me tight. Until we get to the corner down below. What's at the corner? Taxi stand, where I get out. Yeah, like fun you do. Oh, no, Tom. I'm sorry. I've had a grand time, really. Not just this evening, I mean, ever since I first met you, ever since they brought you from your cell and you gaped at your wife with yourjaw dropping. And then in the plane, you conceited lug! And in the hotel and at Maxim's, with your cheap Romanian tricks. Tom, I've loved every second of it. You tell me you like me and in the same breath you say you're walking out. What sort of woman are you? A career woman. I've got my foot in a door that I've been pounding against for years and I'm not gonna let anything turn me away from it. So what has all this got to do with us? Well, I know me. Some people get a light case of love. All they need's an aspirin and a hot water bottle, and it's all over. But not me. No. Do you remember, you said when you got started Monday, you didn't get back til Thursday? Well if I fall in love in January, I'm still miserable next December. Really! Temperature of 105, chills, fever. It knocks me out. I flunked geometry three times running because I was in love with the professor. Tom, Tom, I want my mind free! But, darling, it's too late now. Your cheeks are flushed, your pulse is unsteady. No. Driver! All right. Go ahead. It won't do you any good. You'll go up to your room, sit at your typewriter, and mess around with a few words, throw them in the waste basket, lie on your bed, put the light out, then put it back on again, go back to your desk. All of a sudden, you won't be able to stand it. You'll dash out of your room straight into cafe magenta. Why the cafe magenta? Isn't that opposite your hotel? Mm-hm. What if it is? I'll be waiting for you when you wake up. That's fine. That gives me a fade out on your life story. He lived happily ever after in cafe magenta. - Hotel descartes. - Au revoir, gusto. Don't speak bad French. You don't mean au revoir, you mean adieu. Cafe magenta. Pardon, may I have this chair? I'm sorry. I'm waiting for a lady. Garcon, please, a chair. Yes? I thought so. Thank you, it's going beautifully. I know it's across the street, but I'm not coming. Tom. Tom, don't say those things. Tom, you're making it tough for me! Tom, this is a public phone! Oh, please! No, no, you idiot, no! Hello. Hello, will you please send a boy upstairs? Come in. - Madame? - In here. Do you have a safe downstairs? Yes, madame. What time is it closed? Between midnight and eight in the morning. Good, well here, put this in. The shoes? Yes, it's five of 12. Hurry up! Oh, wait a minute. Here! Put this in, too. No calls. If a man wants to see me, don't let him up. Tell him I'm sick, tell him I'm dead! Oh, madame- or tell him I've left the hotel. Maybe we can find something more convincing. Tell him anything what you want. - Here we go. - Thank you. Come! - Madame! - Yes? That man's downstairs. Well, I'm not here! Didn't you tell him? We did. We told everything. Even that we'd call the police. Well don't let him up here! Well they're trying to stop him now. We're defending the stairs but he may get into the elevator. The monsieur's like a tiger, he keeps saying something that can't wait. - Oh, well, do something! - I'll do my best, madame. Oh now, all right, all right, Tom! Pull yourself together. All right, all right! - Calm down! - Phillips! Will you kindly tell me why I have to fight my way through the entire staff of a second-rate hotel? Why I have to knock out the bridgework of a perfectly innocent night clerk to get an audience with miss Augusta Nash? No! No! Bring him in. He's a friend of mine. Oh. Come, come now. You're all right, aren't you? Just a slight skull fracture. I'll deduct it from your salary. Oh, I wasn't expecting you. Who in heck were you expecting? Jack the ripper? I was just trying to work. Never mind, never mind. Gusto Nash, you're fired as of immediately. Oh, it's not true. I know it's not true! I just wanted to taste the words. Sheer rapture! Unfortunately, it's my painful duty to hand you the best assignment in Europe. What? What's that? I told them in New York you were an inexperienced jerk, and no good, but they seem to have gone crazy. They say anybody who pulled that Spanish stunt is good enough for- what's the job? Associated news correspondent in Berlin. They're counting on you for intimate personal stuff on Hitler and his gang. Oh! Say that again. Special Berlin correspondent. You heard me. Doggone you. Oh. Wait a minute! What happened to Stanley kirk? What happened to Stanley kirk? He's leaving Germany by special request of the Nazi government. First he sends a dispatch about dancing and how 10,000 German tourists are pouring into the city every day with butterfly nets in their hands and submachine guns in their knapsacks. They warn him right then. What does he do next? Goes to a reception at herr Von ribbentrop's and keeps yelling for gefilte fish. Mr. Phillips, do you think I can handle the job? No. No! I know you can't but you get a crack at it anyway. Of all the lucky breaks a fumbling female ever had! I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all! When do you want me to leave? Saturday. That's three days. Yes, that'll give you time enough to get your eyebrows plucked. - How about Tom Martin? - What? What about the stuff? Did you see him? I saw him. Did you get what you wanted? Enough. Good. Bat it out before you go. Mr. Phillips, about the Berlin job, I don't want to go Saturday. What's the matter? Got cold feet? No. I want to go right away, tomorrow morning, first train. Now, don't tear yourself to pieces! Oh no, please let me go, Mr. Phillips. Look, I've got a running start, I'm in my stride. I don't want to fool around Paris. It's no good for me. I want to work. I want to throw everything I've got into it. Berlin sounds tough and absorbing, it's just what I need. Wow! Listen to the swish of that new broom! Don't worry about the Martin story. I'll finish it on the train and send it to you. Pardon, monsieur. Thanks. Are you the one that broke the vase over my head? - Oh, don't worry, sir. - It was cracked anyway. Bad news? What? Oh! No, no. All right, gusto. There's a train about 11 in the morning. I'll have the office fix up your reservation. I don't know how to thank you. - Forget it. Good night. - Good night. - Mr. Phillips! - Yes? Where do you live? Out in neuilly. That's pretty far away. Yes. And it's getting awfully late. Yeah. Oh, I just thought maybe you'd like. What are you driving at, gusto? You wouldn't you like to spend the night here? Right here? I don't feel like sleeping anyway. I want somebody to talk to. You see, I'm too excited about Berlin assignment. You're not sleepy, are you, Mr. Phillips? Not now I'm not! Garcon, a cognac. Pardon me, have you by any chance just seen miss Nash? How did you know? - Oh. - Hello there. Hello. Allow me to wish you the most delightful of journeys and may I also take the Liberty of offering you a small bon voyage gift. Oh, thanks. How did you know I was on this train, you bloodhound? Well, Phillips ran into me last night and we exchanged some little confidences. I told him how to take care of a swollen nose and he told me about your new job. Congratulations, foreign correspondent. Thanks. What's this? Something to wind around your heart with my humblest compliments. Wait. It's typewriter ribbon. That's right. That's what's ticking inside you, miss Nash, a typewriter. With 26 letters from a to z, with numbers, a question Mark, an exclamation point. Well, thanks anyway, from the bottom of my typewriter. Goodbye, Tom. Take good care of yourself. So long, career woman. - May I help you? - Oh, thank you. Ever notice how these European trains always smell of eau de Cologne and hard-boiled eggs? Thomas Martin, you're crazy! Crazy? How? Running after me. I'm not running after you. We just happen to be going over the same track, on the same train, the same direction. It was pure coincidence? That's right. Oh, I see. Ticket, please. Yes. Berlin. - Warsaw. - Thank you. Oh, so you're going to Warsaw! Volunteer tomislaus martinofski reporting for duty with the Polish air force. Mm-hm and when did you enlist? - Before breakfast. - Oh. You don't believe me? My credentials. The Polish consulate is working night and day, signing up flyers. It looks like any moment now. It certainly does. You don't intend to Wade through that? It's my homework for my new job. Well, wake me up when you come to the part where he claims Milwaukee. It you're counting my eyebrows, I can help you. There are two! I wasn't doing anything of the kind. What do you see, gusto? A wood, trees. Yeah, forest of compiegne. Look at it, like a kind grandmother dozing in her rocking chair. Old trees practicing curtsies in the wind because they still think Louis xiv is king. In the shade, well-behaved crickets and woodpeckers scarcely breaking the silence. - Who said that? - Why? It doesn't sound like you. I was just quoting a French boy who was with me in Spain. He grew up here. Whenever the bullets got thick, he used to talk about it. I feel as if I knew every tree, every glade, every old inn. He wanted so much to see it again, to Wade in the Brooks, pick wild strawberries. His name was Andre. He sounds like a sweet boy. Oh, he was. You know, it would be kind of a nice gesture if we could step off this train and take his memory back, back to the crickets and the strawberries. Yes, it's a pretty thought. Yes. You're quite sure that Andre's no relation of your Romanian lady? Oh, gusto! You always think the worst of me. I wonder why! Listen, miss willpower, you're as safe as a church. You're worried about your career. Well nothing can stop you now. You're traveling toward it at 70 miles and hour, next stop Berlin! There's no danger. No danger whatever. Now that nothing can stop you, you stubborn little... You might just as well admit that you feel toward me exactly the way I feel toward you! Exactly. - All right, I admit it. - There's no danger now. Not at all. Even if went over to you and took you in my arms. Even if we decided to step off this train and steal three days for ourselves, three quiet, innocent days before we say goodbye, perhaps never to see each other again, perhaps never to see a forest again, or a brook or a sky of peace. The train doesn't stop. I know, no stops for us. 70 miles an hour. There's no danger- oh, Tom, you better stay over there. I said there's no danger, you know. Not now. Please, Tom. You might even be generous enough to say, "kiss me, you big idiot!" Tom. I said no danger. Got anything on the American embassy in Warsaw, something modern? I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all. Here, drink this, Mr. Phillips. Leave me alone. Belgrade, Naples, Copenhagen, Budapest, Bucharest. But where in blue brimstone is Berlin? There it is, Mr. Phillips. A lot of cheesy pap the feed our Berlin office from the propaganda ministry. Goebbels wrote every line of it. What happened to gusto Nash? Why did she think I sent her to Berlin? Mr. Phillips, we're trying to get the Berlin office on the phone. Shut up! I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all! But please, drink this, Mr. Phillips. Has anything come from Berlin, from Nash? Anything? Just a paragraph, just a sentence? Some slight indication that she's grasped the fact that Hitler is at war? Not a thing, Mr. Phillips. - I'm not happy. - Hello? Hello? Yes! Yes! - I'm not happy at all. - Yes, Mr. Phillips! Mr. Phillips! Berlin is on the phone right now. Berlin? What is the name of is the matter with your office? For four hours I've been trying to get this call. Are you all on the roof taking a sunbath? Where's the stuff from gusto Nash? You tell that incompetent female amateur I'll tear her apart bone by bone! The name is Nash! N-a-s-h. You tell her I'll kick... Why can't you tell her? What do you mean she's not in Berlin? Who are you kidding? She must be in Berlin, she left here two days ago. Listen, check every hotel in Berlin, every train that's arrived, every beauty shop! Maybe she thinks Hitler is waiting while she gets a permanent wave. As far as I'm concerned, her only possible excuse is if you find her in the morgue. I'm not happy. Tom. Tom, darling. It's dawn. Hello. Don't you think we'd better get back to the inn. What will they think? Nothing. It's a French inn. Come on. They get up early in the country. Oh, stay, darling. Just one more minute. It's so cool. There's dew in your hair. And there's an ant strolling up your cheek. I wish it were your lips. Such a little kiss. Such a little ant. I wish it had been an elephant. It's as though you had a brand new set of senses, isn't it. As though you'd been tone-deaf and color-blind before. As if you'd never laughed or cried. No tears, please. No, no tears, even if it is our last day. But it's a long day, darling, and it's still early. Maybe the sun will stop. Maybe. You know, in Spain, when there was just one more day between me and a hole in the sod, I didn't care a hang. Threw the hours away like a spendthrift. Now I feel like a miser. Holding the minutes, counting the seconds. Darling. Look. Aren't they adorable! Look at those! The seven dwarfs must be giving a party. Doesn't look like a party to me. Those are scared animals. Scared of what? I don't know, but they've got instinct. They're running for their lives listen. It's begun. Let's get back to the inn, the radio. With six German armies pushing rapidly toward the heart of Poland, and with Nazi bombs falling on important Polish town, the French and English governments await an answer to their ultimatum. General mobilization has been ordered in both countries. When is there are train for Paris? At 8:05. Agnes! Agnes! I guess we'd better take the same train. My wife will help you pack. Go, Madeleine. I'll get the carriage ready. I can take you to the station at sligo. Fine. It's like waking up and finding the house on fire. Yeah, only quicker. How will this affect your job? Oh, it'll be alright. I imagine Phillips is wild. But once I'm in Berlin and send some stories- war correspondent, gusto Nash. That's climbing your ladder two rungs at a time. Yeah, it's a break, isn't it? How 'bout you? You can't get to Poland. Who says I can't? A little detour through Switzerland, yugoslavia, Hungary. I'll be there. Taking an extra crack at them for robbing us of 12 hours. Yeah. They cheated us, didn't they? Well maybe it's easier that way. I was getting afraid of those last moments. They say you don't feel the pain so much if you're out quickly. Gusto. You're the best. I always said you were just my type. Come on, let's get going. Is madame going to change? I left out the for madame. Oh, thank you. Madame is very lucky to go back on a boat like this. You and monsieur back to america. I have a sister there, she's a chambermaid at the Waldorf-astoria. She married a barber, an American. Oh, the letters she writes! You can see peace in every word. Beds have to be made every night. Whiskers they grow and have to be shaved every day. And that is their life. So simple. So safe. We in Europe, we are sick. We think we've cured one war and it starts all over again. But worse. Worse. Our men have to die. And their sons, and their sons! You are very lucky, madame. Very. We regret that conditions beyond our control make it impossible for us to bring you the Cambridge crew trials at this time. - Any more news? - No. Dreadful thing. The world dropping apart and my wife wants to know about those crew trials. You see, we've got a boy up at Cambridge. Slight youngster. He hopes to be the coxswain. - John. John! - I can't get it, Agnes. But don't forget the sponge bag in the bathroom and my two pipes. Where did you leave your pivot tooth? In the, on the... Oh, Agnes, excuse me, Tom. - Come on down. - They're paging us Americans. This is the embassy in Paris acting on instructions from Washington. Due to the grave international situation, all American nationals in France are urgently requested to return to america at the earliest possible moment. For further information and advice. Kind of a panicky bunch we've got in Washington. "Run, do not walk, to the nearest exit!" Yes. Well, I suppose they have to do it for the old men and the lady tourists and the kids. Wouldn't you feel kind of foolish to beat it now the race is on? I suppose so. Imagine being in Cleveland, seeing the war from a newsreel in the little Nemo theater, watching the bombers dive and all you can do is hiss. And you, reading the war news instead of writing it. - That's for idiots, isn't? - Yes. We stay. We're not turning back now. We're not running home just because we got sentimental for a day or two. No, we make great gestures, don't we. We're gallant and reckless! We're the new lost generation. You, flying 'til it happens, 'til they smash you to bits. And I, writing and... I wouldn't care if I never wrote another word! That's female and middle class, isn't it. To think maybe our lives are worth more than 25 cents. - Gusto. - Oh, Tom. You laugh at the little Nemo theater in Cleveland. To me, it sounds like heaven. Like heaven. Sorry, the lie-de-France is sold out. Aquitania, sold out. Washington, sold out. We don't insist on a private bath. Listen, Alice, this is war. If they can squeeze us in the boiler room, we'd be lucky. I can let you have these, it's on a freighter from Lisbon. Anything, anything! Just get started before the cannons roar! Now let's don't get panicky, Jenny. We can go some place until the storm blows over. Wait in Holland, for instance, watching windmills. Nothing left on the de grace, but some cots in the ladies lounge. - Well, that's okay by us. - That's all right. - Give it to us. - Can't you take care of us? - Sorry. - There's nothing left. The boat leaves liverpool at four o'clock. - Good. - Plane in an hour. That doesn't leave you much time to see Phillips. Oh, it's all right, the harm's already done. I'll send him my official resignation from the boat. Are you sure you want to take this boat? It sounds kind of crummy to me. It's headed for america that's all that matters! Yeah, but in a week when panic dies, there'll be plenty of decent accommodations. No, Tom, it's this boat and today! Aren't those tickets ready yet? I'm afraid the little woman has the jitters. I understand. Here you are. - Thank you. - Come on. Please! One at a time! Gusto, you're as hysterical as those old hens inside there. Don't tell me you're afraid. I'm scared to death. Augusta, the war's 1,000 miles away. Well those headlines aren't, nor the radio, nor all those bugles blowing right in the ears of a confused liberal. Look, honey, I'm not looking and I'm not listening. You're itching all over like a reformed drunk going down main street on a Saturday night, every bar beckoning with a scotch and soda. I've taken the pledge, sister. Hallelujah! - Hey, Tom! - Martin! Martin! Hey, Tom! Why, shep! How are you? Hello, pinkie. Where the heck have you been? Say, I thought you were in Poland. Well, I started out that way, but I didn't quite make it. I, uh, oh, gusto. This is miss Nash. - How do. - How do you do? Gusto, I'd like you to meet my wardrobe. The blue one is pinkie o'Connor and the brown herringbone is Joe Sheppard. - How are you? - How do you do. Well, seeing as you boys are in this line, I take it the rabbits came across. Just like the johnstown flood! Look what comes this morning. A cable from ma with two tickets on the new Amsterdam and all paid for. Well, congratulations. And just in the Nick of time. Well, we're not going. What do you mean not going? Why, we're turning them in for a later sailing. We're going when we get good and ready. You don't think we're gonna leave you over here to have all the fun while we're back in new Mexico spraying grasshoppers, do ya? You mean you changed your minds? You really didn't think we were a pair of heels, folding up and ducking for home now that the show's on again? You can get in the royal air force now. I wish the whole gang was still here with us. 150 who started out. Now that they're getting real plans, they might have half a chance. Ships that make that junk we were flying look like a 1910 kite, hurricanes, spitfires, rolls Royce motors, 400 miles an hour! Let them come now. We're ready for them! I always wanted to drop a little something on Hamburg since I got so sick from that hamburger. - Funny guy, pink. - Yeah, I can see. Oh, say, there's a big chance they might send us to Poland. Imagine the three of us meeting in Warsaw? Naturally, you'll bring miss Nash along as a mascot or first aid or something. Just a minute, boys, I want you to know something. I'm the one that's folding up. We just came out of there. That ain't possible! Oh, come on, Tom, who're you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. It's on the level. We're going back and we're gonna be married. And settle down. In Cleveland maybe. Maybe Tom can get back his commercial license. I'll be writing for "American housewife", how to preserve peaches, kind of a quiet life. Well it's all my fault. I begged him not to break his neck. I like it too much. Well, all right, boys, come on. Why don't you say I'm a yellow-belly and a big mouth, at that! You yellow? Who thinks you're yellow? Did you hear what he said? A guy that's got the nerve to get married? That's more than flash Gordon ever did. You're the hero. And don't worry about those Nazis either, we'll give him a special kiss for you. Not until we get a kiss from the bride. - Yeah. - You bet! - Come on, come on! - Just a minute. Move along. Move along! - Yes, sir. - Goodbye, you lugs. - Goodbye. - So long, Tom. Oh, call up ma, will ya. And tell her it will be a couple more months. You bet. And if the girls at home start knitting sweaters dor us, tell them to make mine in the shape of Dorothy lamour. Okay. All the time we were talking to them, do you know what I was doing? I was saying your prayer. "Arise, my love and come away with me." Here you are, sir. Oh, good boy. We'd given you up for lost. Sorry for the delay, sir, but I had a little argument with the barman. He says as how champagne and mint never went together. Oh, it's a secret formula. Oh, shall open or shall I wait for the rest of your party? Oh, there is no rest of the party. Oh, I understood four glasses. That's right. Fill up all four of them. About this much mint and the rest champagne. Yes, madame. Expecting a storm tonight? Oh, no, sir. Just a precautionary measure for the night, sir, so the lights can't be seen. The admiralty has ordered a complete blackout for every boat. There's not cause for alarm, but we are at war, you know, sir. So we've heard! Does this look correct? Fine. This is sort of a little ceremony. Yes, sir. You see, we're gonna throw a couple of people overboard. Of course, sir. You ready, Augusta? Let's drink to those two dizzy fools, those show-offs with their out-sized ideals. Tilting at very large windmills with very small knitting needles. All right, here's to Augusta Nash, career woman, foreign correspondent extraordinary, ace of news hawks, queen of headlines. Goodbye, Augusta Nash, career woman. Here's to Thomas Fuller Martin, crusader, champion of the underdog, avenger of the oppressed, standard bearer of the great cause. Goodbye, Tom Martin, crusader! Now let's be merciless. No life preservers thrown at them, not even a thought. I might've known. Every time I try to see "the magic flute," something happens. I have yet to get a peek at the third act. Last time, king 209 lost Albania right in the middle of the opening Aria! Well? Well? What's come through about this confounded boat? There it is, Mr. Phillips. It's just a rehash of the earlier news. That's all, six lines? Well, six and a half. All right, all right, what are you sitting around for? The first boat sunk in the war! Come on, we've got to try to build a story somehow. Get a hold of the steamship company. Find out how many passengers were on the boat. Describe the sinking boat, describe the sea at night. Get matimer in London to meet survivors if any. London. Yes, sir. Compare it with the lusitania. I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all. - Where are the hebrides? - Off the coast of Ireland. Get a line over here! Here come some more boats! Tom! Tom! Tom! Here, give me a hand over here. Tom! Tom! Are these the last? No, ma'am. Over at the coast guard station they say some people were picked up by two British destroyers. Other lifeboats are coming in down the beach that's toward the village. Gusto! Gusto! Gusto! Gusto Nash! Gusto Nash! Gusto! Here, gusto! Darling! Darling, it's you! It's really you. Are you all right, gusto? I am now. Oh, darling! It's so good to feel you. You looked so little in that lifeboat as they pulled away. Don't talk to me about that lifeboat. I felt like jumping right out and swimming back to tell you what a liar you were. What a low trick it was to get me in there by saying you'd come, too. I'd have knocked you cold and thrown you in if necessary. What happened to you? I put to sea in a lifebelt. I was only in the water 40 minutes and they fished me out. Your eyes are all bloodshot. I guess that's from trying to see through that darkness and that fog. We were flying squares all night long. Flying? Yeah. Three seaplanes came along. One of them picked me up. Then we flew around looking for other survivors. Like hunting easter eggs. But those English flyers, do they know their stuff. We had a kid from New Zealand in ours. And the way he handled that 25-ton plane! Two dozen times he set it down in that choppy sea to pick up somebody and two dozen times he had to pick it up again. And that takes it out of you. The last time, he just fell right fonnard on the wheel, completely out, laughing, crying. - So you took over. - Well, I had to, gusto! Say, the first time I brought that boat down, I thought I'd split the bow! - Mr. Martin! - Yeah. - Mr. Martin! - Here! Beg pardon, sir. The commander says it's all right, sir. Well stand by, I'll be with you in a minute. Yes, sir. I was trying to tell you, gusto. I asked them if they could use me. This time we're going after that submarine. They think they spotted it while it was broaching. - Swell. - We'll get those babies! It's a chance I wouldn't miss for anything in the... Oh, gusto, I don't see how I can pass it up. I'm here, they need me! Please don't look at me like that. Like what? Don't make me feel as if I'm walking out on you. It'll only be for a day or two. There are lots of boats going home. Home! Who wants to go home? You think I do? Now that I've got a story, a great story, exclusive? Oh no. Look at me. Can't you see that old light in my eye? I'm Augusta Nash again. All I can think of is where is the nearest telephone and the next story and the next! Yeah, when was it? Only yesterday we thought we could throw two people overboard, their ambitions, their big dreams. God knew better. He threw us right back after them. Yeah. I've never loved you so much. That's the best time to say goodbye, isn't it? Gusto! Gusto! Are we ready, sir? Let's go. Have you a telephone? Sure, lady, if you're going to tell your people that you're still alive, oh, glory be to god! - Where is it? - It's round here, miss. Just there. Hello, operator. I want to speak to Paris, the "associated news." Here's something. The athenia was launched march 13, 1913, 13,000 tons, torpedoed at 7:13. All right, send it through. Anything to Mark time until we get one solid fact. I can't even see straight after a day and night in a boiled shirt. You're wanted on the telephone, Mr. Phillips. - Important? - It's miss Nash. - Who? - Miss Augusta Nash. You don't say. Hello. Hello! Miss Augusta Nash? How delightful of you to think of us again. We all thought that you were the victim of amnesia, miss Nash. You're not by any chance in Berlin, miss Nash, or with the German army in Poland? Where are you, miss Nash? In Ireland, miss Nash? How's the weather, miss Nash? For heaven's sake, will you listen to what I'm saying, Phillips? I was on that boat! - Oh, a little boat trip. - How refreshing, miss Nash. The athenia, miss Nash, the athenia! Judas h. Iscariot, why didn't you say so? Gusto Nash was on the athenia! You sweetheart! You darling! I always said you had a nose for news! What a break! Yes, wasn't it? A break like this doesn't come once in a thousand years, I guess. Put on the stenographers, will you? Sure, darling. - Get on the phones, you slugs! - Come on, let's go! Bring back all the photographs you can pick up. And get back here as soon as you can! There's a bonus waiting for you! Okay, gusto, give out, baby! Everything you know. After the first terrific explosion, a huge water spout jumped 70 feet above ship, came down over the lifeboats, washing half away. While the remaining lifeboats were being filled with women and children, another shell carried away the mainmast. It was evidently aimed at the wireless room, but missed its Mark. Susie. - Susie! - Yes, Mr. Phillips. Get me a bicarbonate of soda! Yes, Mr. Phillips. And that flyer's outside. Paris, city of lights, so gay, so full of charm, home of those three lovely sisters, iiberte, egalite, fraternite. What flyer? This flyer. Hello, Phillips. Quite a parade out there. I only hope when they get to the tomb of the unknown soldier, he'll sit up and spit right in their eye. Where did you blow from? I'm looking for gusto Nash. Thought you were flying somewhere? I was sent to the showers. Little souvenir of nonnay, andalsnes. They shot the plane out from under me. Rather, from under both of us. Broken just above the elbow. Not much use trying to mend the other guy. His name was Sheppard. Would you put a nice piece in the paper about him? Something that would read well to a bunch of rabbits? Join me in a bicarbonate? No. Where's gusto? Listen, you'd better get out of the occupied zone before the Germans start taking inventory! I'm all set. I'm taking the last refugee boat from Bordeaux tomorrow. But before I leave, I'm gonna see gusto Nash to say goodbye, even if it's only for a moment. She's not here and you'd better get out of harm's way. It's all right. I have a passport. I'm an American tourist. Now come on, how can I see her? You can't! She's at German headquarters with the official press. Nobody can get there, nobody! Nobody but a newspaper man. Exactly. Well, so, I'm a newspaper man. Now who's gonna swallow that? They will, when they see the credentials that you're gonna write! Now come on, give me a press card. Martin, you didn't fall on your elbow, you fell on your head. Gusto Nash is too busy to breathe. You can't drop in on her with a bunch of forget-me-nots for a sentimental goodbye when she's at compiegne covering the armistice. The armistice! - Did you say compiegne? - Exactly. - The forest of compiegne. - I guess that settles it. Yes, I guess that settles it. - Hello. - Madame! I can't believe it's you! Well, I didn't expect to come back here under these circumstances. What news of your husband? Nothing. He was with the 9th army in Sudan. And monsieur? Not a word. Your attention, please. Gentlemen of the press, and lady. In a certain railroad coach about one kilometer from here, the terms of the armistice will be handed to the French government and signed some time this afternoon. Official bulletins will be given to you as the negotiations progress. You will be permitted to visit the historic railroad coach in groups of five after the conference begins. As the fuhrer will be present, the smoking of cigarettes will not be permitted there. With regard to you fraulein- my name is miss Nash. Miss Nash, considering the importance of the occasion, it is suggested that you dispense with all lip Rouge. Don't worry. My lips will be as white as chalk. Until then you have about an hour. The time is yours to do with as you please. Thank you. Well, I don't suppose anyone feels like a rubber of bridge? Is it all right to take a walk? Hello, gusto. Hello, Tom. It's been a long time, gusto. A long time. I love you, darling. Don't let's count to 1,000. Turn around. I'm right behind you. It's all right. It's not done with mirrors. It's me! Tom. Oh, Tom! Oh, darling. Now, now, now, none of that frightened look! They won't shoot me. I've got a press card, Phillips fixed it. I can't believe you're here, here, of all places! Wasn't it here they robbed us of 12 hours. Well I came back to claim them for us before I say goodbye. Can you get to england? I'm afraid they wouldn't want me. I've got a compound fracture. - Oh, darling. - I couldn't break a match. They sure clipped my wings. All I can do now is crawl aboard a refugee ship and find some cushy job in america. Flying instructor, maybe, teaching kids what wings are for. That's a fine end! You don't think this is the end! Just because in that railroad coach this afternoon they'll be clicking their heels and saying that freedom is a sign of weakness and incompetence, and that slavery is a badge of pride and patriotism. Oh no. No, that can't be the end! You're not crawling back. We're marching back. Both of us! You're coming along? Of course I am. Tom, I've been watching them now for 10 months now. There are things I've got to say. My voice isn't much, I know, but I want to use it without somebody's hand over my mouth. And you, what a job you've got! Making tens of thousands of pilots for tens of thousands of planes. Tom, remember your prayer? This time we have to say it to america. "Arise, my love. Arise, be strong so you can stand up straight and say to anyone under god's heaven: 'Alright, who's way of life shall it be, yours or ours?"' gusto, I always said you were the best.
