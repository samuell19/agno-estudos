Please. No! Oh thank you. What are you working on? A crime watch story. Community stuff. These people got together and exposed a child molester that was living on their street. He was getting a little too friendly with some of the kids in the neighborhood. So they're trying to get all the communities together to form this perv watch. Perv watch? Is that what you're going to call it? Well, that's what I'm calling it, but that's not what I'm calling it in the article. Hey, covering perverts is better than covering high school right? I guess. What do you want for dinner tonight? Whatever. Something that is not too mess. Probably going to eat it right here. I got to get this story finished by midnight honey. I'll figure something out. Hello. Are you serious? OK. Alright, I'll be there. OK, not a problem. Thanks for calling. Alright. OK. Bye. What's that about? My grandmother died. Oh honey, I'm so sorry. Don't be. She was a wicked woman. She used to beat the shit out of me. Now my fat aunt Carol just guilted me into going to the after funeral party. Funeral party? What the hell is that? I guess it's a party after the funeral. I don't know. They're all having a get together. I'm just not looking forward to it. When is it? Saturday. What me to go with you? Nah, there is no need for both of us to suffer. Why don't you just hang out here at the house, or go out with your friends? I'll go and make a showing. I'll eat and then I'll jet out of there. I don't want to hang out with those assholes all day. Why Lynn? Why what? Why did you spend 2000 dollars last month on the fucking Visa? Maybe because you don't make enough Scott. Maybe that's the reason. They're going to take this house right out from under us. Do you understand that? You just need to get another job. No, you will have to get a job. I'm sick and tired of being the only breadwinner in this house, and I'm sick of asking my mom and Rod for money because you can't stop spending. I'm cutting you off. Right now. You are not cutting me off bub. Not at all. Do you understand me? I said do you understand me? You keep mouthing off like that, we can have two funerals this week. Understand me whore? You are not going to ruin me. Do you understand that? I said do you understand that? Yes. Please Scott. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're the sorriest piece of shit I've ever seen. You make me sick. Get out of my face. Do you have any plans today? How's that any of your business? Are you and your dad going out today? We only go out Mona when we get called. There are no houses to gut. I talked to my boss. We are looking for a third shift cashier. I'm not working in some donut shop woman. I'm not doing that! I really think it will be good for you and us to bring in some income. You haven't done anything in months. That's it! I'm not taking this verbal abuse. No way. No how! Hey dad. Hay is for horses. What the hell do you want? I need to borrow 20 dollars. I met this guy and I want to get my hair done. Oh how wonderful. Wonderful my fat ass. Where did you meet this great guy anyhow? Show him your titties at some bar? No, I met him online and there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that? Did you hear that Mona? She said there's nothing wrong with meeting some guy online. Don't you know that there are predators out there that want to rip you from mouth to asshole spill your guts on the floor and then face fuck your skull? They enjoy it. You're totally overreacting dad. So what's his name? Tyrone. Tyrone? That sounds like a god damn darkie. Y You spread your legs for one of those dirtbags, I will kill you. I will fucking kill both of you. No. No. What's the matter? Just had a nightmare. I'll say. You jumped halfway across the room. What were you dreaming about, pole vaulting? Very funny. No, I was dreaming about my grandmother. Why are you so afraid of her? I told you. She was a wicked woman. Yeah, that's all you told me. Tell me the rest. Why does she bother you like this? Well, she did more than beat me. She used to torment me daily. When I was a kid, like eight years old, I had this dog named skipper. I loved that dog to death. One day she comes walking in my room with that little Scottish terrier under her arm. She breaks his neck. She kills him right in front of me. Her laughter boomed in my ears, as I cried and cried. My god. When I was younger, the cops were looking for an old lady that had killed some kids in my neighborhood. They never found her. I know it was my nana. I would bet the fucking house on it. I can see why you have these nightmares. Yeah, but this one is different. This one was real. It was like she was trying to contact me through my dream. You watch way too many horror movies. Just shut off the light, go to bed and forget about the bitch. You have nothing to worry about. You can't come back from the dead. You're a church girl babe. You believe in demons. What if my nana was a demon? I've seen pictures of your nana, and even a demon couldn't be that ugly. Yeah, you got a point. Hey, get that away from me. Come on babe. I'm awake now. You're scaring me. You think of your nana and then you want to have sex? Come on fuck me nana! Fuck me nana. Come on. Fuck me nana. Hey Geno. Hey Wayne. You're looking lovely today. Thank you. Give me that wrench Scott. Hey Rod. I hate to ask you this. If it's about money. This fucking funeral has wiped me out completely. It's not about that. It's about your first marriage. Before you met my mother. Yeah? What about it? I think I'm going to divorce Lynn. I can't take it anymore. Whatever I make at the plant, she spends. I work more hours, she spends more money. I can't ahead. Stay fucking married. These cunts can rob your blind when you're with them. When you're away from them? God damn, they'll rip your fucking balls off. You got a young one too. What is he, 3 years old? Stay married. Open up a secret account and throw some money in there. Do you have a secret account? I have a lot of secrets but we're not talking about me now. Stay fucking married. Put some money in a secret account. Wait it out until the boy is 18 and then ditch the bitch. If she won't go, persuade her. How do you do that? There are ways my boy. You don't hear a word from my ex now do you? What's up with the get up Nelson? Did you want to look like a complete asshole? If I wanted to look like an asshole, Rod, I would have raided your closet this morning. You punk ass bitch. How dare you say that to me. How dare you! How dare you! Calm down Rod. Nelson what sort of statement are you trying to make with that ridiculous suit and top hat? Carol, you have no room to criticize, and I don't think I'm being disrespectful. This is my suit. Personally, I think he looks good. This is a funeral. We should not be arguing. Let's just mourn the loss, and forget about what everyone else is wearing. OK? Oh shut up. Who's talking to you anyway you dike? Nelson, you're out of line. If you're trying to make a statement this is the wrong time to do it. Can you believe the nerve of that pig? I told you not to wear that. How the fuck was I supposed to know that my suit was going to give Rod such a fucking hard on? Jesus christ. Hey stranger. What are you doing hiding out over here? Just hiding from that crazy family of ours. So, how you doing? Good. I visited dad yesterday. Oh Jesus christ, why'd you do that? He's still our father Geno. No matter what he's done, he'll always be our father. Anyways, he's old and harmless. Yeah, you need to give Mr. M some slack. He's a very nice guy. Then why don't you marry him? You would be perfect for each other. I think my father likes men in leather. I ain't no fag. Relax honey. Look, can we please not argue. I hate that we fight all the time. So, what else is up? Well, I got a promotion. I'm now the team leader. It's great for me. Congratulations. So, can I ask you a question? Sure. Have you been having any strange dreams lately? No. Why? I've been having these horrific nightmares about Nana. They seem so real. It's because you miss her. You may not think that you miss her but you do. It's your subconscious telling you the truth. You love her and you miss here. Where can I get a beer? Boy, it's just not a party unless you're getting wasted, is it Sam? I'm getting sick of your mouth. Claire, I gotta go. He's the reason we don't talk anymore. You lose that dead weight, we'll be friends again. Mom. Get out of here. You know how your father is. Sarah! What are you doing? I told you I didn't want you spreading your legs for any fucking monkey. Who the hell do you think you are? I'm her god damn father that's who the hell I am. You need to calm down. You bring this to your grandmother's funeral? She must be spinning in your grave to know your spreading your legs for an animal! Animal? What? I'll beat your fat ass up. Yeah, you people settle everything with violence huh? You're like a pack of wolves. When you're together, but by yourself you're not worth a shit. I'm not afraid of you! Suck my dick mother fucker. I'll kill you both. Remember what I said Sarah! I'll kill you both! I saw a new dress today. It was only a hundred dollars. And I saw a job posting today. No skills required. Perfect for you. You need to relax Scott. You're too tense. Why don't you go mingle. I don't know your family. Get lost! Hey Scott, long time no see. You could say that. I just did. What's it been? Like ten years? I don't really keep track of the time. What's up? Nothing. Isn't it strange how a family can so separated by time and then brought back together when one of their own drops? There are people here I haven't seen in ages. This is something else. Death can bring people together. That's for sure. I think most of the people are here for the free meal. So, what are you doing for work? Working at the newspaper. Writing articles about this and that. Nothing major. Still doing that crap? Crap? I mean, I'd rather be working at a magazine, but I'll take what I can get. You still working at the meat factory? Yeah, still a slave to the grind. Fucking bastards. Hey, remember when we were ten years old, and we had the super soaker water guns and we filled them up with disappearing ink? We shot up all Nana's clothing that was hanging out on the line. Not really. No. Come on. You remember! It sat out in the sun for a few hours. That purple ink dried in. Oh man. She chased us with a bread knife. We hid in the bushes. It was hysterical. Is that what you do? Live in the past? No. No. I just thought you might want to talk about old times. I didn't realize you were so miserable. My dad is so crazy right? Yeah, but I'm used to dealing with people like that. I'm sure if he gave me a chance, he'd probably like me. He's just so full of hate right now. He can't even see anything else. Listen. Forget that. Twin Obsession. Coming to Foxwoods next Friday. I got us the tickets. You want to go? I would love to go. I love Steven Joseph Adams. That lead singer. He's such a hottie. Should I be worried? I'm just happy I could do that for you. I checked out their CD. It's alright for a boy band. They are not a boy band. They look like sissies to me. They are not a bunch of sissies, but I want to thank you for getting me the tickets. I'm glad I could do it for you. So, you want to go have some fun? Hey, it's the Vershons. Good to see you. Geno, read your article on that pervert. Good job! I guess I just have flare when it comes to writing about perverts. Nelson, I don't believe I met your girlfriend. Geno this is Cindy. Nice to meet you. Likewise. So, does anyone know what crawled up Scott's ass? Either he's having a bad day or he's become the world's biggest douche bag. He's a douche bag. He's going through a lot right now with his wife and working a lot of hours. Crazy hours. It's really taking a toll on him. He looks like he's about fifty years old. Hello people. I hope you're having a good time. Hey, funerals always cheer me up. Very funny. Hold my spot for me? I'll be here. You sure now? I'm not going anywhere. Promise? I promise. Tyrone? Tyrone. Nana? Hey Geno, how's it going? Good, how are you? Great. So, when are you going to show me the ropes? Go talk to Carmichael. I'm sure he'll let you tag along on my next exciting interview. Exciting? Like what? Oh I'm just being sarcastic. One thing you gotta learn about journalism is it's 99 percent boring. Just like any other job. I'll catch up with you in five or so years, and you'll be just as disgruntled as I am. Come on. You're out in the world getting the story out. You're a valuable guy. I'm glad someone thinks so. I do. What the hell are you doing over here Britney? I asked her to come over here Carmichael. Really? Didn't I assign you to anything? No sir. I was actually talking to Geno about that. I would really like to cover something for the paper. Oh alright. Why don't you cover me a coffee and a couple donuts? Fat pig. I'll shove a cruller up his ass. Bad day? No Geno. A good day. A very good day. I got a hot one for you. They just found two dead bodies out there in the woods by the meat plant. I want you to cover it. Oh my god. Did they release the names? We don't know shit. That's why I'm sending you. Go over there scoop. Get the story. Get it back to me ASAP. Come on man. Hello Mr. Carmichael. How are you doing today? Shut the fuck up and take off that ridiculous hat. You look like an asshole! So, I see Carmichael yet another good story while I get to sit over there and cover the Ludlow High football team. Geibner, I don't have time for this right now. Of course you don't. You're too busy getting all the great assignments, and playing hide the salami with the interns. You know, kissing ass is one thing McGee, and you do it really well but you're basically sucking Gerald's cock right here. If you have a problem, you take it up with Carmichael. I gotta go. You thought you were really cute, right Geno? Running that piece on me? You ruined my life! You're a peeping Tom Carlos. You were looking at a 13 year old girl. I think people have the right to know. You ruined my fucking life. What gives you the right? You're not god! If you have an issue with it, take it up with the paper. They chose to run it. They assigned the story. People are out there killing, killing! And you focus on me? One of these days. One of these days you're gonna regret what you did to me. Threaten me again Carlos, the next story we write about you will be in the obituaries. I'll cut you to ribbons boy. I'll cut you to ribbons! Help you out there chief? Yes, my name is Geno McGee. I'm with the Springfield Herald newspaper. I was wondering if I could have a few words with you? All I can tell you at this point is that there are two victims. One male and one female. Victims? So they were murdered. They weren't murdered. They were massacred, but if you quote me on that, we'll have a problem. OK, no problem. So can I see the bodies? Why do you want to do that for? If I write about something, generally I like to see what I'm writing about. Come on. Go ahead and lift up the covers. OK. Oh Jesus. Ah Jesus. First time seeing dead bodies young man? No, that's my cousin and her boyfriend. Jesus christ, what happened to them? We should talk. What the hell happened to them? We are still putting the pieces together, but somebody had a bone to pick with these two. This is a crime of passion. Why would you say that? Because whoever did this turned them into hamburger, and didn't take any money or credit cards. Do you have any suspects? No, not yet. Still gathering evidence, but we'll find out who did this. Maybe you know who did it. Why would I know? Because whoever did this, was close to the victims. We'll meet down at the station, and you and I will have a little talk. OK. OK. Mike Tyson better watch out there. What's up Scott? Lynn kicked me out. I was hoping to say with you and mom for a while. These fucking cunts always get to keep the house and all they do is sit on their fat asses, and eat like a cow. Scott, you can stay with me, but that bitch wife of yours is gonna pay for this bullshit. I'm telling you, she's gonna pay for this bullshit. You tell Gamelli to fuck off. He can't have it both ways. If he wants the papers to move, they need some spice now don't they? Yeah, yeah. Let me let you go. What's up Geibner? Why did you give the murder case to Geno? He's my lead writer, that's why. I vied for that position, and I'm far more qualified than your golden boy out there, and yet you're keeping me on the sidelines covering high school football while Geno gets the story of the year? Maybe of the last ten years. There is something wrong with this picture sir. Look Geibner, we are team here. Everybody's got their role. Your role right now is to cover high school ball and whatever else I ask you to do. There are a hundred other writers out there that would be dying for your spot. They'd be out there on that field with tape recorder in hand and a big fat fucking smile on their face and you got the balls to come in here and complain? I want the murder case. Yeah, and I want three blondes. One for my face, one for my dick and one to take pictures, but that ain't happening. No, it certainly isn't. You wouldn't know what to do with it if it was thrown in your face. Get out Geibner! I'll go over your head if that's what it takes. Right over your head. Don't you cross me boy. Don't you even think about crossing me or you will regret it! See you later Gerald. Asshole! How you feeling? To be honest with you, I'm really not. I've only recently reconnected with my family. My grandmother recently died. We were all thrown together after the funeral. I haven't seen Sarah in years prior to Saturday night. Why did you disconnect with your family? Lot of gossip and bullshit like that. I just wanted to get away from it all. That's sad, but I understand. Tell me what you know about Sarah and Tyrone. I don't want to incriminate anyone or thrown anyone under the bus, but my Uncle Gary had a confrontation with them Saturday night. What kind of confrontation? Basically just a lot of yelling. He didn't like the idea of his daughter dating a black guy. Yeah Dave. See if we have a file on Gary Vershon will yah? Thanks. Does Gary own any swords or anything like that that you know of? I really have no idea. Like I said, I really haven't had any direct contact with any of these people. Thanks Dave. Oh, this is very interesting. What? Your uncle's been a bad boy over the years. Registered sex offender. Holy shit! What did he do? Child pornography. He was distributing online three years ago. Assault and battery on a stripper in 1998. Disorderly conduct in 1999. Shoplifting 2000. Breaking an entering 2002. Been arrested 11 times. No wonder he wouldn't go get a job. Who would hire a registered sex offender with a long rap sheet? Geno, I want to thank you for your time. I'm going to continue the investigation. Please don't talk to anyone, especially your uncle. About what you know. I'll make it worth your while. When we are ready to make a move, I'll give you a call and you can break the story, but if you fuck me, I will ban you from the scene. You understand? I just heard. I'm so sorry. They butchered her. They fucking butchered her. I told her not to fuck a darkie. Now's not the time for your idiocy Gary. Blow it out your ass you fat bitch. She was my daughter. Going to get drunk. Police have a suspect but they won't tell me anything. They will. They'll catch the bastard and they will fry them. You can bank on it. I just don't understand. Sarah didn't have any enemies. Did you read Geno's article in the paper? Yes. Cold bastard. So freaking matter of fact about the whole thing. I can't believe he's using this tragedy to try to further his career. I was tempted to call him and tell him off. He's always been trying to outshine Scott, but he never will. Even with this crap. Hey do you have to do that? Do what? Litter. You just through your scratch ticket on the ground. We try to keep our neighborhood clean. I'd appreciate it if you didn't throw your trash on my street. Oh I'm sorry sir. I kind of have a bad back. If you could help me pick that up, I'll put in the trash can right away. No problem sir. The nerve. The absolute nerve! I'm going to call the cops. They're going to haul your ass away. You don't want to mess with me boy. You'd better get to stepping. Mr. McGee, what are you doing here? Where's my son? He's inside. Boy, I need money. What? What are you doing here? I told you never to come around here. Why? Because your wife came onto me. It was the other way around, and you know it. When I tell you not to come around here, I fucking mean it. Don't give me your bullshit boy. You're not going to sit there and disrespect me! Then I will stand up and do it. Get out of my house. I need money and you have it. It doesn't matter what I have or what I don't have. You'll not get a dime of it. I should have drowned you at birth boy. I should have slit your throat. Get out of my house before I throw you out. Give it a try. I will fuck you up, and then I'll give your wife what she needs you faggot. You faggot son of a bitch. Never again dad. Never again will you come back here or you will leave in a body bag. I brought you into this world. I will take you out. Fucking ingrate. I'm gonna get that money. Awesome. Hey, I think you had enough. I had enough of your bullshit. I'm gonna take a fucking leak. When I come back, if there's not a drink right here, on this bar, there's gonna be some trouble. Can I help you with something? Fucking Massachusetts. They legalize that fucking marriage, and I see you two skirts in my bar. This is America. Yeah, this is my country, and you two deviants are part of the problem. Shouldn't you be up the street at the queer bar? Just go and eat something. I think I'm standing too close I don't want to catch AIDS. Don't let him get to you. I'm just so tired of dealing with white trash like that. Gary might be a rough customer. So be ready. He's likely to be more of a pain in the ass with all that booze in his veins. Want to call for backup? No, be ready. Ladies. I don't see my drink bartender. No, I'm cutting you off. You're lucky I don't come over this bar and strangle you. I'd like to see that. Hey man, you got five dollars? Get away from me you piece of shit. Wayne, leave Gary alone. Don't make me call the police now. Come on big boy, give me five dollars and I'll fucking suck your dick. Faggot fuck. They're coming out of the woodwork. Gary Vershon. He wanted his dick sucked for five dollars. Now Gary, you know soliciting prostitution is illegal right? Who the fuck are you? I'm detective Dwyer. This is my partner, detective Adams. We need to speak to you. I don't talk to no pig cops. This can go the easy way or the hard way. Let's go right now. I said no fucking way. Come on Gary. Put your hands behind your back. You're under arrest for the murder of Sarah Vershon and Tyrone Williams. Put your hands behind your back, or we will put you down. You think I killed that race mixing bitch and her animal lover. Your grasping at straws. Get away from me or I'll kick both of your asses. Let's take him down. Come on! Do you fucking mind? Not at all sweet tits. Let me see those melons. You pig. Come on Romeo. Fucking pigs. Fucking pigs. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Oh I know the routine. Better not put me in a cell with a monkey. You OK? Yeah. Just had another god damn nightmare. Have Carmichael take you off that case. It's messing with your mind. I was having these nightmares before I was put on that case. They've just gotten worse. Why are you having them? There has to be some root cause. I find it hard to believe that you're deathly afraid of some dead elderly person. I'm gonna tell you something, but if you call me crazy, I'll go sleep on the couch. I won't call you crazy. I think my grandmother has something to do with the murders of Sarah and her boyfriend. How? I don't have a clue, but I just feel it. Claire, get me another beer. Sam, get off your lazy ass and get it yourself. You have to take out the trash anyway. God dammit, I'm fucking tired of you telling me what to do. Well, you don't have a job now do you? So, I have to wear the pants in the family. Cunt. Anybody over there? Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Sam! Where the hell are you? You better not be out here getting high. Lazy fat bastard. Fat bastard. Hello. Are you serious? Yeah, I'll be right there. What happened? Somebody killed Sam. Your brother in law Sam? Yeah, I got to go make sure Claire is OK. Want me to go? Yeah, let's go. How long was he out of the house? Maybe 20 minutes. Something like that. Has there been anything unusual going on around here? Any phone calls out of the ordinary? Any strangers hanging around? Anything like that? No, nothing. Was Sarah killed by the same person? We don't know. But Uncle Gary is innocent, right? We can't make that kind of statement Mrs. Slone. Detective Dwyer, what do we know? Not much Geno. We are still making heads and tails of this. We should have something for you this evening. I'll give you a call. These detectives are top notch. They will catch this guy. I know. I just can't believe this is happening. You can stay with us if you want to get out of this house. Thank you. I think I'll be alright. We are going to finish up outside. If you need anything or you can think of anything to tell us, don't hesitate to call. Thank you detective. I just talked to the guy next door. He had some very interesting things to say. Oh yeah? He saw and old lady right here in the back yard, just moments before Sam Slone was killed. An old lady? Did he have any description other than that? Yeah. What was it? Remarkably similar to Phyliss McGee. Phyliss McGee, the dead grandmother? Come on now. What are you saying? We got three dead bodies. All related in one way or another. We got one slob in jail that couldn't have possibly killed Sam Slone. Let's say that somebody is killing off members of this family for one reason or another, dressed like the grandmother. Are you gonna write about this? I'll have to. I guess you do. It's OK. I understand. I know it's your job. Sam was involved with a lot of bikers. Do you think he could have messed with the hell angels or something? Sam was home all the time. He never left the house. He must have been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Uncle Gary didn't kill Sam. He probably didn't kill Sarah either. Then who did? I've been having these horrible nightmares lately. Nana's been chasing me around with a sword. It's funny that you say that. She had a sword. After she died we went to her apartment to pick up her cane, and hidden within was a blade. Anyone home? Where's that god damn money? Hanes her way. Better than panties. Phyliss? You're dead. Geno my boy, you are a smash! The old lady assassin is flying off the shelves and I have you to thank for it. Thank you Mr. Carmichael. Please call me Jerry. Listen, I've been thinking of a couple really good ideas to push this serial killer angle. I don't know if that's a good idea. I'm sort of involved. That's the great part of it. Have you thought about the big picture Geno? You're in with the cops. You're in with the family. Put that together and what does it fucking mean? I don't know. Movie deal. That's what it means. Listen, I know some people in New York City and they got deep pockets just looking for a storyline. You and I can make a fortune. We'll split the money down the middle. Look at the movies that made money. Amityville Horror. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Do you know why they were so successful? They were based on a true story Geno and that's exactly what we got right here. We need to jump on this. We need to jump on this now. I don't know. I got to think about this. Think about it. Think about having a million or so bucks in your bank account. You know where to find me. Hey there star. Thanks. How you hanging in there? Honestly, they're running me ragged. I think I need to go back and cover the pervert police. I'm not cut out for this blood and guts. You need to relax. That's what you need. You can say that again. My parents are away this weekend. Why don't you come over to the house and take a dip in the hot tub? I don't think my wife would approve of that Britney. To hell with your wife. Have some fun. Tell her you're covering something for the paper and stop by the house. I'm sorry. It's very tempting, but I know my wife, and I'm sure if I even stopped by your house to say hello, I'd be the next Bobbit. The offer is on the table. Yes Mr. Carmichael. Please shut the door. Take a seat. Yes sir. What's up? Your time is up young lady. I'm god damn sick of you walking around here like a cat in heat. Wait a second. Don't talk to me like that. I run the show here and I'll talk to you as I please. You got that? I'm not some walking hard on like some of these writers out there on the floor that drool whenever you walk by. You're a distraction Britney. What do you want me to do, wear a bag over my head? No. What I want you to do is go home. I'm done with you. And why is that? Um, mostly, because you annoy me, but you're also coming onto a married man. What are you, the morality police? No, I run this paper and you're gone. You're going to learn young lady that bad things can happen to bad girls. Very bad things. Hey there. Hello. What's the matter? Nothing's wrong. Just leave me alone. Do you like me? What? I'm a real good fuck. I can fuck all night long. Get lost before I call the god damn police. Come on bitch. Put out! Help! Somebody help me! We can share her! You sick fucking bastard. What? are you a homosexual? Are you OK? Yeah, I think so. Use your cell phone. Call the cops. Hello. A guy just tried to rape me. I'm at the Springfield Herald and a guy just tried to rape me. Yes I'm safe now. My co-worker knocked him out. He's in front of me. OK. Thanks. My unlucky day today Geno. I got fired and nearly raped. Carmichael fired you? Why? Who cares? You have my email address. Stay in touch. I will. You got a world of talent. Don't let this bullshit saw you from chasing your dreams. OK. Thank you. Hey there coach. How do you think your lions did today? Well we won, didn't we? Yeah, you sure did, but not by too much though. Did you think it was gonna be that close? You never know, but a win is a win. I think we'll do a lot better the next time out. That if we're not all butchered by then. You're referring to the recent murders. Well, the police are doing what they can which is admittedly not very much. Exactly. I want my team in the paper. It makes them feel good and try hard. There's a psycho out there and this is a waste of time. Why don't you try to figure this out. You're smart. I've read your stuff. Sharp as a tack. A lot better than the other guy they have on it. Well, my boss wants me out here covering this kind of stuff now. And my dad wanted me to be an accountant. Sometimes you have to go with what you feel. Go with your instincts. The cops aren't going to solve this. Your boy at the paper isn't. But you can. You can. Let's go over this. Geno McGee's grandmother Phyliss dies. Geno returns to see his family for the first time in years, and now we have three bodies on our hands. So you suspect McGee. Well, I don't rule him out. Let's put it that way. But why would this one death spark a blood bath? And why kill these particular people? Completely unremarkable people. Sarah was a high school dropout. So was Tyrone. And Slone hadn't worked for nearly twenty years. Maybe the killer hates laziness. He sees these three people aren't going anywhere and it bugs him, and perhaps he's close to the grandmother. Her dying sends him over the edge and now he has the balls to do something like this. I can't see it Adams. I just can't see it. The picture is bigger than that. There's a connection we are missing. There's a piece of this puzzle that we still have to find. Why was it that McGee said he lost touch with the family? Something about gossip and bullshit he didn't want his wife to have to put up with. Something like that. Well let's follow the money here Dwyer. Geno's the only one benefiting from the murders so far. How so? Think about it. Here's a guy writing about female fucking softball for the local paper but then this happens. Now he's a big featured investigative reporter. He probably got a raise and promotion. And his wife. She won't have to deal with his family anymore, is she? Once they're all taken out. So, why dress up like the grandmother? We'll have to ask him that when we find him. I think we need to pay a little bit of attention to this reporter friend of ours. I agree. But let's not focus on him alone. I don't get the vibe from Geno that he's capable of this kind of thing. He doesn't seem like the kind. They rarely do. People can hide what they are at their core very well at times. But eventually it rears its ugly head. It's nearly impossible to lead two lives. Nearly impossible. Geno, how are you? I'm fine. What can I do for you Nelson? Well, there's some fucked up stuff going on around here. I'm shit scared. I don't feel safe and I don't think you are either. Jesus christ, they killed my sister. Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry to hear about that. So is your dad still behind bars? No, they let him out yesterday. He's at home, drunk on the couch. Passed out as usual. Then what are you doing here. I overheard something the other day, and I think you might be interested. OK. My mother was talking to Carol, and she mentioned some sort of family secret. When I walked into the room, she totally dropped the subject. What do you think that means? I have no clue. What do you mean you have no clue. You're a god damn investigative reporter. People are dying and there's a family secret. Read the writing on the wall. They're talking about Nana. They could be talking about a recipe for mint brownies for all we know. They mentioned Papa too and they seemed worried about him. Like he knew something. You know, I'm not interested in your conspiracy theories Nelson. I'm not. You know, I'm not even interested in this case anymore. I can't sleep at night. I'm having nightmares about Nana chasing me around. My boss at work is up my ass and I'm at my breaking point. Wouldn't hurt to talk to him Geno. Talk to him about what? When we get there, we will cut right to the chase. We will mention a family secret. If he seems clueless, we'll split. And then drive three hours home. It's just not worth it. I mean what could he know? I think he knows what's going on and that's why he abandoned this family all those years ago. No, he hated his wife. That's why he wasn't at her funeral, and that's why he left this family. It's just that simple. Listen, I'll go alone, but I much rather you come with me. Hello. Hi, you probably don't recognize us. But we're your grandchildren. I'm Geno McGee. This is Nelson Verson. Oh my god. I can't believe it's you. Welcome. Come on in please. Come on in. You know guys, I feel I actually owe you both an apology. Many times I wanted to get in touch with both of you, but I didn't want to bring you into this. I wanted to keep you out of this, but you were always in my thoughts. Thank you. So, what do I owe this great pleasure? I'm a writer for the Springfield Herald newspaper. Oh a writer? I used to do some writing. When I first met your grandmother, I used to write her poems Speaking of Nana, did you hear that she died? I did. Yes, I did. We didn't see you at the funeral Papa. I had my reasons. I did have my reasons. Did you hear about the murders that happened last week? Yes I did and they were terrible. I was sorry to hear about them. A lot of strange things have been happening, and we thought that maybe you could help us sort this out. I'm just one old man. What can I do? Last week Nelson heard your daughter talk about a family secret and I was wondering what that meant. Let me ask you something Geno. If there was something out there that was so terrible, that if you saw it, it'd make you want to commit suicide would you still want to see it? Would you like to be dropped into a basket of live rattlesnakes? Look, I just want to do my job and maybe save a few lives. There is no saving lives. The only way to save lives is to get the fuck out of there. You're terrified. You're trembling. What the hell do you know? Interesting choice of words. Hell. I know a lot about hell and I'm not going to drop you in the meat grinder. The family secret has to stay a secret. And if you're not supposed to know it, you're dead. Does the family secret have anything to do with the murders? What a foolish question young boy. Yes, certainly. Of course it does. But do not chase this thing. Do not chase it. I am gonna chase it. And I'm gonna catch it. People are dying and I'm not going to stand back and let that happen. Geno, you're only one person. One. What you want to confront is beyond reason, beyond your comprehension. Even if you saw it, you wouldn't believe it. I thought I was tough. I thought I was a bad ass mother fucker. Until they showed me what they were and how far it spread. I've been having nightmares about Nana. They're calling you my boy. They're calling you. And they have their eye on you. What do you mean? Nana's calling me? She's not dead what? Let me put it this way. What's black is white. And what white is black. Don't believe anything you see, and don't trust anyone. They're all dirty. Hey. What's this about? Something big. Something really big. Been doing some investigation into this old lady killer. What? I told you to cover sports. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I am covering sports, but I'm looking into this too, and I figured some shit out. Been talking to some of the townies and they helped me piece the puzzle together. OK, tell me about your puzzle. What do you know about Geno McGee? He's my lead writer. I know that. Take a look. What exactly am I looking at here Geibner. When Geno was 16, he nearly killed his father. He attacked him with a knife for christ's sake. And now there's somebody running around, dressed like Geno's dead grandmother, killing somebody with a knife of some sort. Geno is no killer. You don't know that. What you do know is that putting him on this case was a massive conflict of interest. Look it. The only thing I know is that you don't know shit. Geno had it out with his dad. So what? What 16 year old doesn't? You let your jealousy get the best of you here Geibner. Geno is on this one, and I want you forget this case even exists. Not a chance. Then you're fired. So be it. So be it. When I figure this shit out, you're going down too Carmichael and I will own this paper. Leave right now! Sue, what's all the noise out here? Oh come on girl, don't be like that. Call detective Dwyer immediately. He needs to speak with you. Why are you so worried? He asked about your whereabouts the nights of the murders and Scott's house just burnt down. He wants to know where you were. They fucking suspect you Geno. They think that you're the killer. Bullshit. Yes, can I speak to detective Dwyer please. OK. Yes. detective. Yeah, yeah, I can come down. Can I ask what this pertains to? OK. I'm on my way. Are they gonna arrest you? For what? I haven't done anything. Look, just calm down. Have a cup of tea. Relax. I'll be home in an hour or so. They probably just want to bring me to the fire for my report or something. Just calm down. Geno, please have a seat. Sure. We have some things to talk about. You know you scared the shit out of my wife, right? Sorry about that, but let's move on OK? Geno, trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together and you keep coming up, everywhere. You don't show your face for ten years and now you're back and people are dying. You tell your sister that you're having nightmares and she should get rid of her dead weight of a husband and now he is dead weight. You visit you grandfather today and now he's dead. What? Found his body all sliced up. What am I supposed to think Geno? I was with Nelson all day. He was with me. Before, during and after my meeting with my grandfather. He can clear my name. Yeah, or he can lie for you. Fuck you. This is your idea, isn't it? I got to admit, dressing up like your dead grandmother. That's original. It's a first I think. Maybe Ed Gein thought of it first. But you're going to be right up there with John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer. You're gonna be famous. Detective Dwyer, I want to speak to you one on one, if not, I want a lawyer, now. Whatever you want. Geno, talk to me man. How do you explain this? Your grandfather dies immediately after you visit him. Doesn't make sense. None of this makes any sense. He knew something. Something about a family secret. They found out somehow and they got to him. Who are they? I don't know. He didn't say. But, the serial killer is only the tip of the iceberg. I'm telling you, if we get this old bitch. It might just be the first brick in the road of uncovering something enormous. Let's talk a little about the fire at the Garvey residence. I don't know anything about it. I was away all day, and if you clear me on that, you have to clear me on the rest. I'm not a killer detective. I'm a reporter. That's why I keep showing up. I'm covering a case that you're trying to solve. You're wasting your time with me. I'm gonna level with you Geno. I've dealt with some cold bastards. Killers that strangle their mothers and rape their grandmothers and never shed a tear. You are either innocent or you're the coldest son of a bitch I've ever met. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. You can leave, but don't stray too far. I'm gonna sort this mess out. This is a family issue. And I'm gonna find out who's spilling all this blood. So they charge you yet? Charge me with what Geibner? With murder. They're gonna figure it out and you're gonna get charged. You can't hide behind your granny's dress forever. Why don't you leave me alone? Hey arent you unemployed? What are you doing with this fucking tape recorder. You got no one to turn it into. Yeah, I don't shine Gerald's knob like you do. You didn't answer the question. They charge you yet? Get off me. I know you're the killer. I can feel it. And I'm gonna expose you to the whole world. It's no wonder you never got a promotion. Your investigative skills are worse than your writing ability. Whatever you say killer. I'm not afraid of you killer. Maybe you should be. Hey Nelson, you and your bitch watch this. This is how you fucking bowl. Yeah! I'm gonna take a fucking leak. I know Cindy. He's an asshole. Hey cunt. How about a date. Gary, you need to relax and keep it in your pants. Why do you have to play so hard to get? Because you disgust me. Cock tease. Hmm. Wendy are you alright? Absolutely. I know how to deal with guys like that. I can talk to him if you want me to. Thanks Banas, but I don't need a man to fight my battles. If he insists on being a prick, I'll just call the cops and have him removed. The offer stands. I got you Geno. I got you. What's your issue baldy? You're the one with an issue, not me. The only issue I got, is some bald pecker staring at me. Don't even talk to him Banas. Yeah, listen to your bitch. Get yourself hurt you bald fuck. Hello girls. Ready for another game. We should probably pack it in. It's getting late. Late? I'm in no rush to call it a night. Let's go to the casino. I'm feeling lucky tonight. Come on. Don't you need a job before you spend money at a casino? Who the fuck told you to talk? Don't you think it's messed up that you take your wife's money from that freaking donut shop and spend it at a casino? Why don't you get a job? Can we drop this already, please. Get her in line there boy. You get her in line. I'd never let your mother pipe up like that. Hey we're going to the girl's room. We need some money. Why would you need money for the girl's room. We need soda stupid. Give us money. I want the change. Lane six is jammed. Can you take care of it? On it. Wendy, I was wondering. I have a couple of tickets for the Danzig concert this Saturday night. Wanna come with me? Sorry, but I think we've been over this ground before. Forget it! Just forget I said anything at all. You know what your problem is? You go out with these total scumbags that treat you like shit. Maybe you like that kind of treatment. You won't hear another word out of me. Live your life. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I have a lane to fix. Hey Baldy. He's got no hair. No hair at all. He just introduced me to his parents. That's a good thing. Not really. His dad is 400 pounds. If he follows in his footsteps, he'll be a beached whale and I won't be with a guy that has a bigger chest than me. What is taking you so long? Other people have to use it. What, did you fall in or something? They can't still be in the bathroom. Larry can you check it out? I'm not going in the girl's bathroom. Come on man. Just go, knock. If they don't come out, just come back, OK? Fine. Angela! Angela! They ditched us. They took your car and they left us. Angela is a prankster man. She thinks this is cute. I got her cute hanging for her right here. Do you have your keys? No. Shit. I'll be right back. Changed your mind about those Danzig tickets huh? I don't blame you. Listen, this isn't going to work Wendy. Can you do me a favor. Grab me a nine, sixteenths. Nine sixteenths. Wendy. Wendy, nine sixteenths. Wendy! Yo Jeremy what you doing bro? Jeremy? Oh my god Jeremy! Oh my god! Jeremy! Come on. Let's go bitch. What the fuck is your problem? Who did you tell? Who the fuck did you talk to? Only you and I knew we were going to see Papa and now he's been butchered and the police suspect me. Let him go Geno. Let him go! You set me up! Whoever's going around killing people found out we went to see Papa and you're the only one who could have said anything. Geno, that's enough. Blow it out your ass Gary. No, no, leave my son alone. Or else. What, are you in on this too? Is that why you're protecting Nelson here? Why don't you chill out Geno. You're losing it. No, I'm starting to put it together. What's the god damn family secret? I don't know. There is no secret. Fine. Play dumb. But if I find out either one of your are involved in this, you're both going down. What a dick. Dad are you alright? Yeah, yeah. What is his problem? What is he talking about? Grey haired fruit. The other day we took a ride and visited Papa. He thinks I blabbed to someone about our conversation. Well, he's acting pretty irrational. You think he could be it? Be what? The guy who's hacking people up into hamburger. Geno? No way. Out of the question. Closing time. Time to go guys. We're leaving. Just give us two minutes. Fucking white trash. Hey we're closed. Where is that god damn cunt? Do you have to talk like that? Yes, I have to talk like that? What is that prison talk? You were in prison right? No, I was in jail, and I talked like I pleased there. I don't take shit from anybody, least of all some bitch. I bet you were the bitch in there. I bet you had a boyfriend. Didn't you Gary. Nobody cornholed me bitch. Open it! Open it! In here! What about Nelson? What about Nelson? Nelson is on his own. He's on his own. What kind of father are you? Shut up bitch. I'll fucking lay you out. That granny is out there. Shut up! Oh fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Come on! Come on granny fuck! Come on! What are you doing here? Research. You want a story. I'm working on one. Not like this you're not. You can't just come in here and look through anything you want. You need clearance. You're getting as bad as Geibner. Hey, be quiet. I just lost my grandfather and I want to know why. And the files here are going to help you? You bet your fat ass they will. Gotta be here somewhere. What exactly are you hunting for? The old lady killer isn't the story here. There's something bigger. Something my family has hidden for god knows how long. No, no, no. Geno let's not get crazy here. We got a nut on the loose. That's what we have. Yeah, and that nut may be a part of whole group of nuts. That's what I'm trying to find out. Oh shit! Let's get the hell out of here. I'm right behind you. Where the fuck were you. I've been waiting for hours. I saw her! I fucking saw her. Saw who? My Nana. She's alive and well. Come on. Sit down. Let me make you a coffee. No time for that. We have to go to the graveyard. What? Why? I want to see my grandmother one last time. You're crazy. You're out of your mind. Honey, the cops are gunning for me. I have to clear my name. Geibner is up my ass. Carmichael was slashed to ribbons and I was there. What do you think the cops are gonna say. I think my grandmother is alive, and I'm gonna prove it. How are you gonna do that? If she's in the coffin, then it's not her running around with the blade. But if she's not, she either cheated death or the devil sent her back to earth. Come on. Let's go. Jesus. Dwyer, you let that son of a bitch go and now look what happened. Fucking bloodbath. Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. He just butchered ten more people. That bowling alley looks like a butcher's shop. No, I'm taking him down tonight. You're not doing anything. Sit down and shut the fuck up. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? You. Now sit down. Let's talk. No, there's no time. There's no fucking time. What kind of ring is that? It's a ring. I like the design. Now let's think this out here Adams. No. Forget it. You think it out. I'm going to go take care of this. Well, here it is. Hold the flashlight please honey. This is illegal Geno. It's a lot less years for this then what they got pinned on me. Please just hold the flashlight. I'm cold. Relax honey. I'm almost there. I want to thank you for this romantic evening. Hey, if I don't figure this shit out, I will have plenty of romantic evenings behind bars. Now, just give me a minute. Jesus! Jesus! I told you! I told you! They buried an empty coffin. I told you! There has to be a logical explanation for this. Yeah, there is. Nana's alive and the bitch has snapped. What's the plan now? I got to figure this shit out. That's the plan. I want to know why my Nana faked her own death. When I figure that out, the rest of this will just fall into place. I'm gonna find out what's going on here and when I do, everyone involved is gonna go down like dominos. You're a writer. That's all. You're not a crime fighter. Just go to the cops. Why? So they can say I stole my Nana's corpse. Come on. They're idiots. They're looking for someone to blame and they're focused on me. I'm guilty until proven innocent. You should have stuck with covering high school softball. Wasn't in there, was she? No she wasn't. I just cracked the case. You're in danger. Get in the car. I need you to jump in. Both of you. Alright, let's go. Looks like your Nana faked her own death and she's on an all out killing spree. There's more and you know that detective. Yes. There's evidence of cult activity. But I found out where they're meeting tonight, and we are gonna crash they party. Us and what army? Don't worry about it. I got a shotgun. I didn't want to get anyone involved that we can't trust. I don't know how widespread this cult is. What's that? What's that noise? I don't hear anything. There's a thumping in the trunk. I got a bowling ball back there. It's rolling around. It's what you're hearing. What's your name there darling? Danielle. Well, Danielle. I'm gonna need you to stay in the car while your hubby and I take care of business. Understood? Yeah. This doesn't feel right. Trust me, will you? Let's kick some ass. Oh shit. Fuck. Oh fuck. Who the fuck are you? The man asked you a question. Scott? Surprised? Thanks for bringing him here. You're in on this too? Geno, you're not dead. There's a reason for that. Be happy. People are dying. They're dropping like flies and you want me to be happy? Just come to our meeting. It's starting in a couple minutes. Fuck you. You think it's loaded? You are too much. I'll get that. Just listen to them honey. No, not you. You wanted to know the secret. And you are gonna find out and you'll be glad that you did. You told these sons of bitches that we went to visit my grandfather. It wasn't Nelson. It was you god dammit. We're wasting time here. Follow me Geno. Learn something. Oh, so you like dressing like a woman, huh, Scott? I thought you were a man's man. I do what's best for the family. Dressing like a drag queen. That's what's best for the family? Silence. Silence? You sound like a fucking asshole. I wish I never went to that party. Three thousand years ago it began, and tonight we celebrate the addition of a new member of our group. Tonight will be night of sacrifice and rebirth. What are you? Fucking Satanists? No. Just listen. Geno McGee is with us tonight. Although he may not realize this. He shares our philosophy. He's ambitious and driven and he has discovered our existence, which is not an easy thing to do. Geno. We have had our eye on you for a long, long time. Being so observant, I'm quite surprised that you haven't realized that we have been with you all along. From the time ou were born. To your marriage. To now. It is now your time Geno. Your time to realize your destiny. So Rod. What you're telling me, my whole life has been arranged by you and this group of misfits. This group of misfits, as you call them, is part of a much larger society that rules the world. That rules the world Geno. All of the world leaders are told what to do and when to do it by us. To answer your question, we have made life easier for you. Mentoring you and molding you. You have had a good life. You have a home. A wife and a good job. Now things will be much, much easier if you allow it to. So, what do I gotta do? Wear a robe and worship an owl? Why do you simplify everything? Many have misunderstood us for thousands of years. Now Geno. To become one of us, you must make a sacrifice to Moloch. Detective Adams has been a thorn in our side for quite some time. And now, Geno, your future is now. Kill him! Honey please. It's a great opportunity for us. You want to become a world famous writer and this is your chance. Write a book about the granny killer. It's part of the reason for this ridiculous get up. All the pieces are in place for us to be great. I used to think we were great. But it would have never been enough for you, would it? Look at me! I have a fucking knife in my hand, and you're cool with me stabbing this guy and joining this sick group. It's for the good. They're not sick. People die every day. They die the streets and in bullshit wars. Those deaths are meaningless. This one means something to the both of us. Remember when you told me that you wanted to rule the world? Now you can. Literally. Dammit, you know I didn't mean literally. I thought you had more heart than this. I really did. You said the reason we don't talk anymore was become of Sam. Sam is gone now. Now we can be a real brother and sister again. No. I don't want the blood on my hands. It's not worth it. None of its worth it. I'm going to the FBI. The FBI works for us. Now, make your choice. Join us! Geno, this is a golden opportunity for you. You look good for a dead man Carmichael. I had to do something. Didn't expect my golden boy to show up and pawing through the files. Once Scott showed up, I had to do something. Make your choice! Join us. Fuck you. Jesus christ. What the fuck? Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! What are we gonna do? Continue with the plan. What if goes to the FBI? Let's get back to the meeting. He cannot run forever. I'm filing for divorce. I'm Agent Rivera. Sorry to keep you waiting. No problem. Read your statement. It is something else. You've had quite a night now. You could say that. I did some research on this Moloch character. Very interesting. Some people believe the Clintons, the Bushes, and every other world leader worship that damn thing. Imagine that. Worshipping an owl. Meet at this place called the Bohemian Grove, and now they meet at a small town, Ludlow. Next time you go to one of these places, say hi to Bill Clinton to me. You need to lighten up. Lighten up? How many more bodies need to pile up before you want me to take this seriously? I'm sorry Geno. The story is so sensational. It's tough to digest. Maybe it would be easier if you went up to that cabin and made some arrests. Here's my question. Your uncle said that this organization ruled the world. All the richest and most powerful men and women were part of it. Why is your uncle part of it? He makes less than I do. It's not about money Rivera. It's about usefulness I think. There's people from all walks of life involved in this. In all different levels. My uncle even said that the FBI was involved. Really? Why don't you tell me what else your uncle said?
