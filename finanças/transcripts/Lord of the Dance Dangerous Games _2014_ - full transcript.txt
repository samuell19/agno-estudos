(CLOCK TICKING) AUDIENCE: Aww. (MUSIC BOX PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (CLOCK CHIMES) (BELL TOLLING) MICHAEL FLATLEY: When we started this whole thing, it was really just a dream. Nobody gave us any chance to get out of the gate, let alone last for 20 years. We worked so hard. Blisters, blood, broken bones, sprains, fractures, pain. Night after night, for 20 long years. And we made it. Against the odds, we're still here. Lord of the Dance is the biggest selling dance show of all time. No matter what you go for in life, it's gonna be tough. You're gonna come up against brick walls but you've got to find a way past it. Go over it, go under it, go around it, go through it, but find a way to the other side. If you have a dream, and you're willing to work for that dream, you can have anything in the world. (RHYTHMIC TAPPING) Nothing is impossible. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) We didn't come this far to finish second. (AUDIENCE CHEERS LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING DIABOLICALLY) Wakey-wakey. Hello, sweetheart. Oh, you don't look happy to see me. Pity, I've been so looking forward to this. You can't have your dream without a little nightmare. The original lord, your proud protector, has gone. Forever! And you dare to come back here with some young pretender? This is a dangerous game. (BARKS) When I get my hands on you, little spirit, and that puny little flute, I will have all of the power and your Lord of the Dance will be dead. (LAUGHING DIABOLICALLY) MAN: Follow your dreams. Follow your dreams. - (BIRDS FLUTTERING) - (BELL CHIMING) (BELL CONTINUES CHIMING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (CRANKING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) (DIABOLICAL LAUGHTER) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY) (RHYTHMIC TAPPING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) (MAN EXCLAIMS) (ALL EXCLAIM) (EXCLAIMS) (ALL WHOOPING) (ALL EXCLAIM) (ALL COUNTING) (ALL COUNTING) (EXCLAIMS) (ALL WHOOPING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (ALL EXCLAIM) (AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (MEN EXCLAIM) (MEN EXCLAIM) (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND WHISTLING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING LOUDLY) (AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (THUNDER CRASHING) (RHYTHMIC BEATING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL COUNTING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING LOUDLY) (MUSIC PLAYING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) It was your dream then.
