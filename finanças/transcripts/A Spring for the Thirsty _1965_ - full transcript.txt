Holes in the roof. People are laughing all around. A well needs clean-up, it is only for pigs and beast ? too bad even for them. Damn fool! Why don't you clean it up, why don't fix it up, why don't do it, don't do up a fence. Don't do up a house. God's fool, you don't pray. An infidel. Die, devil! Nobody will come to your funeral. Your sons all gone. Grief, grief with that times. Mother cursed me when I was a child. Mother cursed me when she washed swaddles. Child, wish you... My water, my beauty. Wash me, don't evade me. My spring water, for good looks and health. Even there you carry my water? Grief, grief with that times. Mother cursed me when I was a child. Mother cursed me when she washed swaddles. Child, wish you have no luck... Needs a coffin. Boys, is there Andriy Serduk among you? Or Kyrylo Serduk? Or Vasyl Serduk? Have you met him? What's the deal, father? Only slime left, no water at all. Damned soul, why do you making that coffin. For what you need it. Do you have nothing to eat. Or have nothing to dress. You are brainless. What are you doing? You going to die, but never do. And the devil wouldn't take you, damned soul. He makes the coffin, but the devil doesn't take him. And he still makes the coffin. I will clean up the well by myself, for people, for you and me. Go to hell with no well, with nothing and everything. Longest July nights Judgement Day came Dad, you feel aggrieved, that I wrote you on rare occasions, but a letter like this - speaking - you probably never recieved. Accept Solomea kindly, Don't scare her with your grey mustache, because she is pregnant. You wrote us about that nickel bath, I shall get it for shure, I will seek it in every store. Someone may help me, I'll get it, so you will bath at home. So that you will not break the wash-tub. When you are laying it could be broken. Get up, Dad, get up from grave! Get up, Dad, get up from grave ? it's a woe to live near family. Get up, Dad. Get up, dear heart. Get up, Dad, get up from pit ? it's a woe to live near mother. Just when we prepared for a vacation, then this shocking telegram. Ah, fellows, at least my sons are here. So we will start with a good custom, the whole family will clean up the well. Don't be crazy, a child might remain without head. If came with head, then will go with head. Shut up! You don't used to follow rules! So, this well I digged along with your grandfather. And inside each of yours, my dear sons, this water among with mother's milk! Only a few of you liked water clear like a teardrop. But for instance, Petro ? Petro always got bad musty water, so that he grew up stupid and goofy. Dad, I went to neighbor to drink water. You care only of your belly. How your father lives, how's brothers... draw breath, you don't care. How with first one I made a fortune. How with first one I made a fortune. How with second one I came to blows. How with first one I had children. How with first one I had children. How with second one them kicked away. How with second one them kicked away. Don't say a word about this bitch. Don't say a word about this bitch. (Rus) Don't say a word about this bitch. Grief, grief with that times. Mother cursed me when I was a child. Mother cursed me when she washed swaddles. Child, wish you have no luck. My children, you brought me sorrow. Because no husband at home. Our mother, don't be sad. When we grow up, we will go away. Mother, we will go to mountains and plains. Mother, we will live in foreign countries. Mother, you will cuckoo like a bird. That you had children, no one to bring water for you. Mother, you will be like an eagle. That you had children, no one you can give a look. You wrote me, you couldn't got that nickel bath. I think I'll bring it. And you at least will bath at home, Everything will be OK.
