out of service NORA Hi, Nora! Hi, Atou. How are you? Fine, just fine. - And you? - Great. Slept well? Yes. With Bobby, as usual. Bobby still? Yes, twenty years on, it's still Bobby. Great, thank you. - Have a good day. - Thanks, you too! Morning! Can I see your badge? - How come you're all setting it off? - I have nothing. Nothing at all. - We all love Daniel. - That's great. Morning. How was your evening? - Not bad. - I had a great time. I watched a rerun of Dallas. - Seriously, Dallas again? - It's great. Every morning, it's Dallas. 150,000 years old, more plastic surgery than Barbie. If I was as rich, I'd be even hotter than I am. You don't think you're hot? - You're kidding me. - Why so jealous? - J.R., Dallas! - Come on, each to their own. Pamela, maybe, but the others, give me a break. Give me a break, honestly. - You love me or not? - Sure. - But not with Dallas. Period. - Love me. Your call. Me or Dallas? - For so little? - It's not so little. - For so little! - Look, we've had it with Dallas! - Marry each other for real. - No way! And fight all you want at home. - Keep it all at home. - Dallas is so over! You tell them, Nora. I've got a headache. You've given her a headache. - Make me a coffee, will you? - Not a chance! Know what? Get J.R. to make you a coffee. The love of your life, J.R. - Make me a coffee. - No, no more coffee. - What's wrong with you, Lila? - Stomach ache. - Stomach ache? - The yelling every morning. - Every day... - We're used to it. - I can't take any more. - You're not pregnant? - I don't know. - Perhaps you're pregnant. Inshallah. So, please, for my baby... If I have one in my tummy. That's not bad. Name it J.R. - Your baby. - Bobby. Not Bobby, J.R.! - See? - There you go. Everybody loves Bobby. There. The race is on! - It's a race. - Marco, you're getting old. You need long arms as well. What is it now? - There, there! - Where? - Open your eyes. - Open my eyes. I've had it with this. Look at me with the vacuum cleaner. Between the seats even! And the corners? Sure, I go in the corners. Look! Go on, do it. That's right. - This cake's a labor of love. - I'm glad you like it. - It's really good. - I put my heart into it. I bake for my kids and you. - But you never taste them. - I'm not a big eater. So we're your guinea pigs? The taste test. You enjoy it. You know I'd demolish it, if not for my tummy ache. - But I'm taking my slice. - Yes, take it home. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It was great. Atou, sing us the same song as in the car that time. Which one? She imagines... All right, that one. Let's go. She has, in her black eyes A whole history that is not her story She carries within her roads of exile The bright sunshine of mornings in April She is an orphan of another life She knows she's from the south by amnesia There's been so much laughter, so many tears too Like in a film she never got to see She imagines The still heat of towns painted white She imagines music from the windows Celebrations and sorrows in the sunshine She imagines All the laughing children in the streets She imagines hands saying goodbye Tears in their eyes Under the blue skies Mouth open, please. There we go. Okay? Quick check. In 2-3 weeks, your teeth will be here. I'm so pleased. All this time... 15 years, you know. - Already? - Yes, 15 years. Each time, I couldn't afford it. Now I've managed to save up. Good. - To get them fixed. - You'll see, you'll have beautiful teeth No more suffering. With the ones I've got. - So I can eat what I want. - Sure. Without pain. No pain. With these dentures, no pain. Eat and smile all you want. - It's my pregnancies. - I know. Children are important, too. In your tummy, they take your calcium. Our whole life, they take our vitamins. I know. That's kids for you. Pregnancy's tricky. Ravaged my teeth, my whole life. Not your whole life. How much more? Let me check your account. 1,000 euros still to pay. Okay? Yes, I have it ready. I'll pay today. Of course. I'll leave you with Deborah, for the payment. All right. Great. I'll prescribe you a mouthwash, too. Three times a day. Thank you very much. And your children? All good, praise be to God. Praise be to God. My eldest's getting married. Congratulations. Thank you. My congratulations. As the saying goes, Mazel Tov. That's kind of you. I'll send you a card. I'd like that. All right. I'd really like that. Hello, beautiful. How are you? And you, Vivianne? I'm fine. Not too tired? No, I'm good. You slept well? I'll get it. So what did you get for me today? I got you some whiting. Some good veggies. And a gorgeous lettuce. You'll love it. I didn't forget your favorite fresh bread. - Thank you. Nice and crisp? - Yes. - Thanks. - The way you like it. What would I do without you? What would I do? I'll put all this away. Stop. Thank you. A nice cup of coffee. And the little one? Good. Her sister, too. When will you bring her to see me? I will. I can't wait. As soon as I can, I'll bring her. She's a good girl? Yes. Like her grandmother? That's right. She takes after her grandmother. Really. A chip off the old block. She's my treasure. What's more beautiful than children? Honestly! Nora! When you've done your homework, can we call? - Yes. - Cool. Any plans tomorrow? I don't know. Maybe we could eat together? Sure, why not? Cool. You don't say much, it's intimidating. That's my Granny. I gotta go. - All right. - Talk later. - Yes. - Cool. Granny! All right? Fine, and you? I'm good. How was your day? I'm a bit tired but it was okay. Who's the girl? That's Carmen. My new next girlfriend. - A new one again? - With Jade, it was... It was hard work. I hope cancer gets them, motherfuckers! Repainting the elevator, the useless bastards. Madre mia, fucking elevator, it's always the same! Hello. - How are you? - I'm worn out, going up and down. The elevator's bust. I won't pay my rent, screw it. You're right, it drags on. Deathtrap elevator! A shithouse! Fuck them! - Have a good day, though. - Thanks, you too. Put your bag in my room. Maria? You're all alone? Where's Mommy? She's in the shower. In the shower, and you're alone? Something to drink? A glass of water, son, please. Give Granny a kiss, baby. Let's see if she's still in the shower. I'll go see. - Get out of the shower. - Coming! - Four showers a day! - I'm coming, Mom! - You don't pay the bills. - What's with you, Mom? That's my seat! Look at this mess. - Too bad. - You're bad. It's naughty! - Here, look. - Naughty! Your turn. - Want to watch TV? - Leave me alone, I don't know. - I was taking a shower. - Granny's angry. It's all good, just great. Here we go. I was in the shower, she was playing, Mom. Cut it out. Always criticizing. Either you're on the phone and she's alone... Is that relevant? Cut it out now. - You're irresponsible. - What? Leaving a 3-year-old all alone. All alone? She's got spunk. Don't push it! - When I'm not home... - Stop, Mom. I worry about you leaving her on her own. Where is she now? Playing with Jawed. - You guys arrived... - She was alone! I was in the shower. Anything could happen, leaving a baby on her own like that. This isn't cool, making me out to be an unfit mother. I was in the shower. Get off my back. Back off, always criticizing. - Can you turn it on? - No. Here? All wrong. Let me watch. - Put the cartoons on. - No. - Jawed, you're no fun! - I'm no fun? All right, Mom? Sure. What's up? You look pensive. You drive me crazy. Four showers a day, leaving her... It's always me, never your son. Sabah, Sabah.... - Always. - My son? - He's not here, he's got class. - He didn't go. He cuts class, fine. I take a shower... You're always checking up on me, Mom. I've had it with you. You're kidding? Here comes the slob. All right, you old cow? Shame on you. He's a slob, he disgusts me. All right, Mom? What's up, old cow? It's always on Sabah, never him. Easy with that! - Sorry, old cow. - You're the cow. You going bald? What's with the beanie? - I walk in and... - He wasn't in class. He's full of shit. Don't get on my nerves. - I had classes. - Why manipulate her? I had classes. You didn't go! My friend told me. Shame on you, lying to your mother. Show some respect. Then it's me the baddie. Go play your dumb games. - Can I drink my coffee in peace? - You can, Mom. For sure. Anything you want. Beat it! Gonna take a bath. Not a bath. With candles, strawberries, whipped cream. And... We have madeleines! - Who made them? - Vivianne. So good. They're for me? You disgust me. Beat it. Why get so worked up? Mommy, why are you crying? Granny! You disgust me. Your son disgusts me, I swear to god. - He's your brother. - The hell he is. Got it? Always me... How come? Like I'm not your daughter. You always mess up. Mommy, don't cry. It's okay. Yeah. Knock it off. Beat it! Why are you still here? Get lost! - Slob! Get the hell out! - Knock it off. Leave her alone now. I'm with my mother and you get in the way. Your body's in the way, always in the way. Get the hell out now. Beat it! - Stop! - Don't cry! It's okay. They're stopping. Stop talking. Don't talk with him anymore. He's not your brother anymore. Are you asleep or pretending? Talking to you. What a mess in the bathroom. Mom, I'm tired. Let me sleep, please. If it's not dirty pj's on the floor, it's water everywhere. Mom, I'm tired. Please! This can't go on. I'm gonna leave you guys. I refuse to live like this. It's not a life with you guys. You tire me out, that's all you do. It's a miserable life. Just misery. There we go, and I ache all over. Sleep. That's right, sleep. Sleep. The maid's here to clean up. And beneath your cassock? Just a leopard-print teddy and spandex shorts. Let's go with the music. Girls, positions! Who's that again? Elie Kakou. He's well-known? One of the great comics. - He was always on TV. - Never heard of him. I watched him a lot. How old is he? He's passed away, peace be with him. Old-school, though. No jumping, Maria. The neighbors downstairs! I've already told you. Don't jump. I'm home! Hi there! - Hey. - How you doing? - Not tired? - I'm good. And you? I'm sick of it, I nearly punched a customer. Don't worry, I'm eating. I was wiped out, done for the day, closing the checkout. She rocks up, like, "Ma'am, please, can I pay with you?" Lays it on thick. I'm cool, like, 10 minutes here or there. - Just rope to hang myself. - How come? Today, we had a special offer on men's socks. Ten pairs for 5.90, not bad. I got some for Ellyes and you, Amir. - Thank you. - Good job. And your hair dye. In the same bag. For free. Stolen? It fell in the bag. Stealing's not right. No, fuck the store. They're loaded. They budget for it, they know we do it. They won't miss 2-3 items. You'll get yourself arrested. Fired, with a bad reputation, following you for life. Anyway... Not anyway. Don't steal. Don't worry. I promise you. In her cart, she had maybe five packs of socks, so I scan everything. And she says... "No, why are you charging me 5.90? "It said 3.90." I tell her, not these socks. She insists, insists, insists. I felt like punching her. What did she say? "They're too expensive." She left the whole lot, the whole cart. I had to cancel each item. - Shoulda stayed shut. - Exactly. I was too nice. You do someone a favor... - I'd have gone ape. - If she was young, I'd have... - I'd have punched her. - That's why you're late? Yeah, closing up. It doesn't matter. A bad apple, that's all. Those are my potatoes! Quit swiping my food, slob! You're a big, fat chicken, honestly! A chicken, word! Fat chicken! No! You told him, you were slimming to look like a mermaid. - He's helping you. - I haven't finished! Eat up. Shush! Shush! Morning, ladies and gentlemen! First, the roll call. When we call your name, go see my colleagues there. Arms out, please. Sit. Sit down. - You all right? - Fine. - Not too tired? - No. Things at home? Good. Yeah? Everybody's fine? No worries. How's Maria? Good. She's growing. Always with me. A smart cookie. The kid's a ray of sunshine. And Sabah's there for you? Yeah, nice and easy. Sure? It's fine. And Muriel? Works a lot. Right now, she works too much. Poor kid must be knocked out. What about Jawed? Working hard? Jawed's really sweet, works hard at school. He has a girlfriend. A new one. Carmen. She's a gipsy, really pretty. - A new one every week. - And a story to tell. I've stopped listening. Since he was a kid. He'll talk for hours. I listen or I tune out. I just can't. And Amir? Amir, you know... Gaming. - Sleeping. - Lazing? He eats. Leaves me all the trash. There you go. Tell him to come see me. - He won't. - I'll tell him. Cuddles looks after himself. He said, "No, I'm tired." He sends all his love. Give him my love. I'm losing my hair. Really? How come? I don't know. I'm not sleeping. It's just a water issue. Or calcium deficiency. When I get out, I'll go to Turkey. What for? Transplant. You have to be bald to get a transplant. They add some on your... I'm gonna be like Zidane? With a big hole? Zidane's handsome. Thanks for the cash you sent. It's not much. No, it's... It's a lot. Thanks. - You bought food? - Some. That's good. Eat. Don't worry, I eat. Can you do something for me? Remember what you found in my stuff as a kid... Chocolate. Chocolate. I can't sleep. I can't ask Muriel. If I do, she chews me out. You know, young guys... A pretty girl rocks up, they go nuts. You're older, there's more... respect. They know it's for someone in prison. Or you wouldn't come. All right. It'll work out, don't worry. Don't make yourself sick. - And with her father? Where is he? - It's cool. He sees her now and then, no stress. He's not coming? No, I didn't invite him to participate in the party today. And you? My wedding's next week. - At last, about time. - I know. You'll come? - Let me finish. - You're lying. No, let me finish. Go on. - He lies before he starts. - Jawed! Listen! Say something, you. Go ahead, talk. You don't defend your uncle? - It might not be true. - Useless nephew. - Talk. - We're listening. I'll tell you anyway. Why wouldn't I? - You're full of it. - One day, I met Mike Tyson. Let me finish! He says... Are you Amir? He knew your name? Who doesn't? So I say to him, That's me. What's up? He says, You yelling at me? I say, Yeah! So he says, Come on. He takes me to a gym with a ring. He says, You're sure you wanna box with me? Like, you're hot stuff. All the girls want a piece of you. I'm jealous. I say, you're not wrong about the girls... They like me. So, first round, he aims a hook at me. I duck it. Left, right. He gawks, in shock. He says, You're the best I ever saw. I say, Sure, it's natural. Bam, I bop him in the head. Drop him. Yeah, right. Stop! Mom! Muriel, help! Blow it out now. Big kiss! The gifts! The gifts! Here, have some dress. There you go. Do you want some dress? - Apparently not. - Okay. - Can I have some dress? - Here you go. Who wants some cake? Who likes it? Who doesn't? You can tell me now. It's great! - My foot hurts. - This bunny weighs a ton. It's cool. Be nice, please. I'm starving, too. I hope there's chow. - Gotta be. - Piece of shit! Put on a smile. Like that? Won't even get this through the door. Coming. Hey there! Look who it is! Here, Maria, this is for you. - For your birthday. - Fantastic! You like it, sweetie? It's enormous! Happy birthday! Thanks, girls. Hey, Muriel, all right? Hey, how are you? All right, Sabah? - Say thank you. - You like it, Maria? - Fantastic! - She won't let go of it. You came just in time for some cake. - We won't say no. - Come on in. I'll wrap you a slice. - Wrap you up a slice? - Yeah, cool, sis. You got scratch, you get chow, anything you want. You're chowing for me. You've got two stomachs. Scratch, scratch, we're all stuck on scratch. I dream of scratch. - Every day. - Dream of a job! I didn't ask but you guys look out of wack. Times are hard. Not so bad, but yeah, I guess. - You're right. - Yeah? - It shows. - Broke. - Thanks a bunch. - I'm not gonna lie. Yeah, I know, I know. They never paid. I'm sick of it. - What were you doing? - Shitty jobs! Labeling. Sales, special offers, all that. Drudge work, real drudge work. I'm sick of it. I'm flat broke and it can't go on. There's my daughter. You guys are always loaded. You get nothing for nothing. So what do you guys do? Look, you want money... you find a way, right? So what's your way? - Way of what? - You're determined enough? Gimme a light. Tell me and I'll tell you. If you're not determined, I don't talk. I'm determined if it's for scratch, sure. I'm determined, worse than ever! More than your friend. Can I know now? You wanna know now? Yeah, I do. - Here's the thing... - You guys are fresh. Mashallah. Thing is, my aunt... You've seen my aunt around? Yeah, I've seen her. Anissa and me, we go back years. My aunt runs a business uptown. Her business there... I told Anissa years ago. She came in... What does it involve? - What's the business? - Simple. Dudes call up my aunt. We know them. They're regulars now. They call my aunt. They have a kind of kink. They've all got bigtime jobs. So to decompress, they need... girls like you, exotic, Arab maybe, to mess with them. You mean they have fantasies? Is this prostitution or what? It's not prostitution, it's... - Mess with them, how? - You just... - You hit them. - You cuff them, you beat them... They're into stuff like, you wear a costume... - Sounds creepy. - Like a bunny outfit maybe. - Hold on... - You beat guys up? And they pay you for it. You took so much shit from a loser, who gave you a bad rap, that's not creepy? - It's different. - How come? You have no choice, you let him bone you. He bones you, he dumps you. You shut up, you like it. Those dudes, there are billions of them. Guy bones her for a blunt. Sperm dumpster! It's simple, listen up. First off, it's tax-free. - So she... - How much do you make? - Up to 400 euros. - 400! You keep your benefits. Sounds awesome! It's all for you. My daughter's birthday, and there's another surprise on top. Awesome! - 400, that... - Who pays that? It covers your rent. And buy yourself a new dress, Cinderella. C'mon, Coralie, it's good money. Listen up, yakking's not my thing. The offer's there. Take it or leave it. You're sure no one'll find out? No one'll find out. Did you know? No but... We're here. You think we just let you loose? It's no scam bullshit or whatever. We're doing this, and you're doing it with me. I need the money. You think I'm staying in shit? Look, they're fresh! Are you nuts? - She's being prissy. - It's not prissy. Shut your trap now. Pain in the ass! Her mom's here, I can't shout. Shut it! I want silence. You're not interested, just dip. - There you go. - As we say, Hasta luego. I don't want to be a prostitute. It's not prostitution. You're a prostitute for free. Shut it! I'm gonna come over there. Whaddya mean? Stop talking with her. I'm in. You tell me, fuck his ass up, I do it dry! - I'm tired. - Just one more. I nearly went in there. My legs hurt. All right? Okay, Maria? - Holding the collar. - No, don't. Exact same as my ex. Just like her. Like her? - So hot. - Like, sure. - I'm gonna smash her. - That's not a thing! It is. My ex, I'm telling you. Come on, hit it. - Poor Laura, feel sorry for her. - Quit jumping! I'm not jumping, I'm floating! Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Know it? Muhammad Ali. Draw for Granny. No, I can't. You do the princess. I'm no good at princesses. You are. Granny's only good at cooking. No, you draw the princess. You draw her arm or leg. And then you get... I don't believe it. You suck! I swear, they drive me crazy. - Shouting again. - Again. They drive me crazy. I'll go. You cannot be serious. - It's not loud. - Come on, Mom. The neighbors can hear you. I'm ashamed. - Hello! - Mom, you're interrupting. Calm down. Take the hat off. In our home, you think snow falls from the ceiling? - It's my style. - I'll give you style. Off! I'm cooking. Take it off. Mom, stop. - Mom... - Granny! Love ya, Mom! You're too loud. Funny guy. You're always shouting. Quit cheating. - Cheat? In a beat 'em up? - Look! I'm winning. Quiet, loser. Hit the wall, cheat! We'll throw it away. - It's expensive, Maria. - It's not! - Really? - No. I'll clear up. You clear up, baby. - Sorry. - You're sorry? I'm sorry. Sorry, Granny. Why are you sorry? I'm sorry. I am so sorry. - Cheers! - To the end of hard times! Health and happiness! The rest we can buy. - Tell her to buy new shoes. - She'll buy ten. - A whole wardrobe! - Exactly. If you ask me, that's top of the list. Then there's new clothes, nails, hair... - Coco? Isn't this beautiful? - Lit. - You ever been in a place like this? - Never! We only bring the lucky few come here. See that tree there? This one dude wanted a submissive scene. He says, I'll play the goatherd. No probs. Here we go, up the mountain. - It's a forest! - Zip it! She's so gangsta! So I'm busting him like this. Busting him, busting him... What with? Busting his ass! Yeah, but with what? I grabbed... Not a tree. That's mad, bro. A branch! - Going off on all sides. - With me keeping an eye out for joggers. I bust him till he bleated like a goat. He was like... Fucked him up. She's lookout and she's like, Okay, Anissa? No worries, I fucked that ass. I used lube, fam. Use vaseline, it's on social security. Slides right in. It's on social security? They pay there and then? Come again? I clock him if he doesn't pay. He pays, you bet. I mean, they pay before or after? They pay up front, no worries. What'll you buy? I'll see my daughter right. My mom, the family. Are you still rapping? Yeah, for sure. - Still? - That's cool! I bought a studio downtown. In installments? Easy, sister. You drop any beats? Yeah, I did. Show them what you can do. They're in the gang, bro. They're with us now, in the gang! Show them. - A quick clip! - What are you waiting for? - Here we go. - Let's see who you are. Cue up the sound. The intro's solid. Your heart's hard and soul's fragile I know it's not always been simple From your memory, I'll scrub pain and wars, fears and scars Running down your cheeks, I saw tears, tears, tears Life tells me every day forgiveness wins over, over, over I knocked down doors when you gave me the force I needed You said, my girl, watch me carry the world on my shoulders while I'm cleaning You let me glimpse the sun, calm down, bury my enemies You worked hard for your money Big numbers on clocks in the hood She's killing it. Shut the fuck up! Yemma, yemma, yemma You know, it's for my ma. Respect. I saw your pain, eyes gleam Bury treasure in a seam My good mother in my prayers I try to be better than yesterday I hang, hang, hang, the whole noche I dream of bella vida, the dolce I tried to cover with cash The old man's world that's a bust Yema, my heart's breaking You read me with no soul baring Get you out of the projects Forget our troubles and defects One smile from you And I'll give all I have left You have to go work To earn your weekly wage Work, work, work A surefire hit! You have to go to work To earn your weekly wage Work, work, work I guess the girls got you up to speed. They explained the concept. I'll just run over it again, so we're all on the same page. BDSM has two distinct strands. Humiliation and physical pain, which may be combined, but here it's mostly humiliation. Physical pain? We hit them? - Yes... - You fuck them up. - Really? - Yes, totally. - Insults? - Exactly. Flagellation, insults or even sodomy. Exhibition, confinement, all that. - It's all by choice? - By choice, exactly. This is not a video game. It's not... The aim isn't to beat folks up. As an example, if he says to you, Grab the candle. We pour it on him? That's his request. Without setting him on fire, why not? - And if we set him on fire? - If he asks... Gauge the danger. If it's dangerous for him, you don't... He says, stab me. You don't, right? That's nothing like candle wax. The wax can go up in flames. If the guy says, stuff it in my butt... It was just an example. It's up to you, how far you go. In any case, as she pointed out, you won't be alone. Anissa and Ludivine will be there at first. We don't toss you out there. It's pro. Show we can trust you, and we step back. Exactly. Absolutely. I have a little idea. Anissa will demonstrate. I'll put some music on so you guys see what to do and how to act. Okay, Anissa... Over to you. Go for it. She hasn't lost it. Never. One of you want to try? Go on. Go, Sabah. Sabah, you're up. I proud to see that nothing moved. A real jewel. C'mon, show me what you can do. Okay, I'll show you. It's all about respect. Always. - You decide if he touches you. - It's your call. Girls, let's hear it for Sabah. Ready? Pops Brownie will be crazy for that. Magnificent! A good start? - See that ass? - Slaying it. They'll be springing boners. Pepperoni like this! You found some real talent. No kidding. That's the soft version. There's real potential. You'll take your time... Great. How about we move onto the photo shoot? You slip into the outfits... - It's pro, right? - Yeah. You were right. Then we'll upload you onto the site. And away we go. - On the site? - Sure. The site. The website. With the photos. The photos go on the site. You're unrecognizable with a mask. Discretion works both ways. Mrs. Drissi, I'm running late. Sorry. Let's go. This way. I must inform you that the case will go before a criminal court now the investigation is over. The investigating magistrate will instruct the case to proceed to criminal court. The case will be assigned a hearing, so we're given a date for a hearing to plead our case. It's good news. It means I'll give priority to your son's case, to our case. That implies you settling up with regard to my firm, agreed? I settled up, I already paid. - To be clear... - Several times. Settling up means there are outstanding bills. The first of those, the first bill... The first registered invoice, I have right here. Let's take a look because it seems quite old. My secretary flagged it up, and yes, it's two months old and that... The fees agreement stipulates that everything must be settled up before the hearing. So this invoice is for 1,075.14 euros, including tax. It must be settled up. You have your checkbook here? What do we do? No, I didn't bring it. You came without it. Fine. Look, what I can do, as a favor to you, would you agree to come back with the check tomorrow? - Pay you tomorrow? - Yes. The two other checks... - Two more? - Yes, that's my whole point. That's three invoices in all. Yes, three invoices. In six months, all I've done is pay. All right, Mrs. Drissi, but let's not forget, your son's actions require a defense. We provide that defense, with all it implies. You ask me for a lot of money. I ask for a lot of money but remember... The whole time, I give you more and more. Look what I have here... The fees agreement we signed. You have a copy. - And Clause 14... - Each time, another bill. No, that's all now. All right? - How are you? - Fine. - So I've been told... - Yes. I'm sorry, really sorry. - So we can't continue? - No. Problems. With my son. - You're sure? - Yes. It's lucky I called before you deposited it. The attorney offers no alternative? I waited 15 years. I'll wait some more. - This has to come first. - I understand. - I'll get your check. - Thanks. More money? That's right. I can't ask for an advance at work. No more. I've asked too often. I can't ask. They don't do it, the shits. No advance wages. Thinking it over, I had an idea. I have some jewels I can sell. And I hope they'll fetch a... A good amount, I hope. I'll see what I've got. No, don't worry. For sure. We'll work this out together. Don't look at me with stars in your eyes. - Where are you going? - I know I look magnificent. Where? To see one of my girlfriends. One of them? Naughty. A player's gotta play. What can I say? Take care, won't you? - How come? - Go. It's just a date for a quiet drink. Take care nobody spikes it. Mom, take care of what? I'm unstoppable. Take care? You forgot who I am? You know, I'm like lightning. Know what I mean? People see me and melt. Because I am the sun. Got it. Go now. - See you later. - Go. - You like my outfit? - Ew, ugly! Granny! Who put the earrings there? They're Granny's. The earrings? - Let me see. - No, they're Granny's. - They're beautiful. - Yes, they are. They're Granny's. - That's a ring. - Yes. They're rings. Granny's going to hide them all again. There are roaches there. - No, they've gone. - They're ants. Are the ants nice? Ants are nice. Hello! Can I get a 2-euro mix of candy? - A mix. - All different kinds? - They're gay. - Really? Yeah, lesbians. Seriously? Yup. For sure. You're positive? Stuck together like that, see? Hold on tight, don't drop them. Looking at me, you retard? - Who's a retard? - Don't bother. Coming by here, you missed me? - What? - You missed me? Came by to see me? - You think that? - Leave him his fantasies. Cool it, mind your language. Mind what. Watch your lip! Fat whore! - You've changed. - You look shit, worse than ever. Look at that beard, you bum! Like some homo sapiens! Homo sapiens? What do you want? Grow a pair. Go buy a pair! Look, I'm a bombshell, after a kid. You're a deadbeat. Fat whore! Everybody's had a piece of that ass! The whole neighborhood. You're a dumpster! Go scissor over there! Propping up walls, waiting for shit to fall into his lap. Zero ambition! Zero ambition, screw you! Go on, get outta here! Beat it, fat whore! Go whore it up! - You pathetic deadbeat asshole! - Beat it! Own it! Pain in the ass! - She's kinda nuts. - A fat whore! She claims her girl's my daughter. She had so many dicks, could be anyone. - No lie, there's a likeness. - What likeness? Have some respect. I don't know... - You guys gotta stop. - Gimme a break. Acting up outside the store. Blame that whore! She's going to hell, all the dicks she had. - Hey, tata. You lost? - Hey, son. I don't message first. - You replied to her stories? - No way. No way? And she... - She sent the first message? - Yup. You blocked her or... I blocked her. No choice. We're here, bro. We're out there, sure. I see that. See you around. - Aleikum, tata. All right? - Aleikum salaam. - All good, hamdulillah? - Hamdullilah. - Hello, son. - Hello, tata. All right? - I'm good. - Good. What do you need? Hash, coke, weed? 30 euros of hash. 30 euros of hash. Right. Here. - Thanks. - I gave you extra, tata. Thank you, son. Take care. You take care too, tata. Bye. Bye, tata. See you around. You've got to be kidding me. No, why? I'm shocked. About what? You guys. Getting into prostitution. - No, it's different. - Wrong. Why is it prostitution? C'mon, it's weird. There's no sex. - Really? - Only violence. An agreement between consenting adults. That's all. There are guys with fantasies. There you go. It's taboo but... It's nothing raunchy. We rock up, hit them, insult them... And take the cash. SM is still prostitution. There's no kissing, no penetration, nothing. They don't touch you, not even that. It's only you hitting him. Hit him, insult him and ciao! - It's lit. - Job done. He obeys you like, Yes, mistress. It's lit, totally lit. For once, the woman dominates the man. It's great. - You understand? - Sure, I understand but... It worries me. Be careful. In the world we live in... It's all about scratch. If you gotta go hit guys, you hit, you caress. I caress with my beauty. Teasing with my body, my eyes... Don't get used to it, it's easy money. - Just be careful. - It's not for life. If it's only me touching, that's what matters. Then it's cool. I hear you but just asking... Tell me if you want to try. Are you cracked? You guys are nuts. Count me out. Just now and then is all the money you need. - I'm a mother. - And I'm not a mother? Just count me out. Welfare all my life, no way. Like you're loaded? - Don't shout. - What's with her? - It's normal. - Shoulda kept the public defender. No way, you'd never get out. She'd better get me out. Stop shouting. I'm not shouting, Mom. - Calm down. - Don't worry, I'm fine. Guess what... I brought you your chocolate. But heck... No more. - Thanks, Mom. - Last time. I won't ask for anything more. I'm shocked by the place. - Why? - When can I give you this? - So I can get rid of it. - Here he comes. Fast! Give it, give it. - Sure? - They've gone by now. God forgive me. Turn around. Turn around, he says. I changed your diapers. Thanks. No more. You gotta quit 'cause I won't do it again or go there again. I saw those poor kids sitting there. Blame France. Don't talk nonsense. - "Blame France"! - Back home, it's legal. - You guys... - Like a pharmacy! - Yes. - Straight up. All your nonsense, it's always, Blame France! Not stealing, but this. Why do I get up at 5 to go cleaning? All these years? Folks get up at 5 to go watering it. That's too easy. Mom, in Canada, the USA... - Quiet! - Spain even... Don't talk about drugs. Let me be. Most meds are drugs, Mom. Young kids dying every day is mostly due to drugs. Prisons are full due to drugs. Stop it! Big pharma fills its pockets due to drugs, with opium. - That's cannabis. - Stop it! They treat cancer and even Parkinson's with it. Don't talk like that. - I won't talk then. - Right. You talk nonsense. That's gold. This one, also. It's just the... The chain and pendant, I'm not so sure. Really? We'll check but... The hallmark is... It feels plated, gold-plated. So it's not gold? It's not gold. How come it's not gold? It's not gold. Family jewels? Yes, my father gave it to me. It's not gold. - You're sure? - Yes, certain. That doesn't mean he didn't buy thinking it was gold, but it's not gold. It's not gold. - I test this one? - Yes, and that. That one, you said no. Gold-plated, too. Okay, well... Like that one. - So that's it. - Okay, let's see. That makes 13.40 grams. In other words, 280 euros. All right, done? - Okay? - 280? I'll add my earrings. I need more. Okay. Those are gold. Yes, they're gold. That makes 350. I'll add my wedding ring. - Hold on. - That's it. 350's good for us, sir. Muriel, let me be. Nora, not your wedding ring, please. Not the wedding ring! Let me be. Maybe just its value... - So you... - We'll keep the wedding ring. It's gold, for sure. That adds another 50 euros. 50 euros, Nora. Keep it. Your wedding ring. It's my decision. Let me be. All right, sir. I'll just need your ID card, please. My heart says I love you The only words it knows I don't want to lose you I need you too much You're here, chaos. Your daughter's here, chaos. Talking about him and love, his wife... Chaos, too. So the episode has rattled everyone. The upside here is the star card, relevant to both your son and daughter... And the focus is on the first card in the spread. The first card is the traveler but it is also a renewal. You close one cycle. You open another cycle. And there's the prospect of joy. Because of the star card. So we're looking at great joy coming your way. And a rebirth. So, work for your daughter. Your son will be out, I guarantee it. With cards as pretty as this. There's a blockage, it will take time. Progress is difficult. See? The transmutation card. It will take time but... A ritual might speed things up. To get him out? To speed it up. He will get out. Do not worry. He will get out but... I'd suggest a little ritual. You know, for some of my ladies, with this problem, I guarantee it works. I prepare a little mixture. In these bottles here. How much is it? 5 euros. Frankly, it's not much for the benefits that it brings you. If you agree, you have this bottle with my little mixture of sea salt, olive oil and so on. The first thing to do, you go to the sea shore. Okay? Facing it, always facing the sea. You start the ritual by emptying the bottle halfway. You know how to bake bread? All right. Then... You bake some bread. Because as you know we... Yes, of course. We give the bread to the poor, naturally. If you want it to work, you must help someone in need. Of course. So you bake bread. As we say, a sadaqah. Exactly, sadaqah. Now this bread must be organic. Completely organic. Keep it pure. The first poor person you see, either homeless or a lady begging... you give them the bread, okay? And go straight home. My hand's dirty. You'll see, it's couscous. Couscous isn't dirty. No, custard isn't dirty. You love Granny? Same here. Love her how? Real love? Like a princess. Like a princess? Am I Princess Granny? You... You're the queen. And I'm the princess. Baby! In my princess dress. Granny's your queen? Don't you have a prince? No, no prince. I don't need one. I don't need one either. Bravo, my girl! Bravo, Granny! Bravo, my little girl made bread. Hey there! How's my baby? How are you, Mom? You're baking a cake? No, bread for my coworkers. They want to try it. Here, Mom. - What's that? - It's to pay Ellyes's lawyer. Where's all that from? This morning, I went to buy cigarettes. I got a 1-euro scratcher. I spent 1 euro and won 400. You spent 1 and won 400? Ask Muriel, she was there. Why'd I lie, Mom? - It's not haram money? - For sure. - You're sure? - It's to pay the lawyer. Never bring haram money into my house. Mom, I spent 1 euro and won 400 euros. If you won it, fine. Make great bread, Maria. See you later, Mommy. See you, sweetie. Mommy's kind. Hello, Michou. How are you? Just fine. Just fine. Except for the dirt, I'm all good. Take care of yourself. I'm always going to see the doctor. I do X-rays, I do... All the time, non-stop. I had several close shaves with death. Really close shaves. Death didn't want me. Good, you're still here. I'm a devil. - I brought you some bread. - Very kind. - And water. - Very kind. Put it down there. I'll put the bottle there. And some fresh bread. You'll love it. Thank you. I'll be going. To work. Work hard then. I'll come by again. Yes, come by. I'd like that. Is that her? No. No, not her car. - I sense... - They're stopping. Hey, girls! What are two beauties doing at the roadside? Waiting for our girlfriends. - Wanna ride with us? - No thanks, boys. We'll have a fun time, drinking... We have plans. A girls' night out, thanks. That's too bad. See ya. That's your friends? Have fun! You too, guys. Thank god you came. They got chat here. - Let's go. - We're all gussied up, too. Yeah, mashallah. - You okay? - You guys look great. - Are we there? - Yup. Saber? - Who? - Guy I work with. In the forest? Yeah, he's down there. - The party's here? - He's picking us up. We can't go there by car. Saber! This is beautiful. They're way down there. Let's talk till they get here. It's beautiful here. What's going on? Why the long faces? We're gonna fuck you up! Why? What's up? If I talk, I'll lose my shit. You guys talk. What the fuck did you pull with Gilbert? We pulled him off. If you only pulled him off, I'd be cool. - He asked us to do it. - His ass is shredded. What's that bitchass look! - I'm just saying we did what he asked. - Who is Gilbert? I'm not messing with your heads. The optician from Catalans. The guy you went off-script with. He asked for an extra. So, Gilbert, who's been my client for 5 years, who's always been very happy, where is he now? In the hospital, isn't he? Flat on his belly. He can't even sit up, with your shit! How did you leave the client? In a pool of blood, and you take off? You said, if they want extras, sort it out with the client. You sort it out with me first of all. Quit bawling at me. I'm not bawling at you. Cool it. I'm not bawling. I'm very calm. When we were done beating him with what you gave us... - You'd given us lube... - Not a stick, though. He wanted a stick in his ass. I said, we're not savages. You're too nice. So I stuck it in his ass. Yes, it's true, but only because he asked me to. All right. He asked me to, guys. What is this? In the business 5 years, no problems. And two dumbass bitches ruin everything! We trust you, Anissa and me, and you fuck us over? - We didn't. - You fuck us over? - We thought you'd be happy. - Happy how come? Stick-in-the-ass happy? - It was a plus for you. - A plus for us? If it's a plus for me, when do you call? - What the fuck! - When do you let us know? When do you pick up your phone? We were going to call. So why didn't you? We forgot. Hold on a second, can we talk? Know what I forgot? To call you back. From tonight, we're through. See those rocks? Tuck in, they're dinner. The cash? Shove it! Like with the stick. - Calm your aunt. - Enough! Enough! Over! Know what? The moola, the villa, all your plans, no more, terminated. Terminated. But we came through for you. I'm talking to you. You're in deep shit. Tonight, you and your loony-tunes friend are in shit. You're gonna starve. Go back to labeling shit. Don't give one fuck. Fuck you, guys! - Fuck you! - You can't leave us here. Don't leave us in shit here. No, on the street. We have no clue where we are. The hogs'll ream your asses! - Like we give a shit! - It's a nightmare. Walk, bitch! You can't leave us out here! Terminated! Go blow your ex! What's wrong with you? Are you nuts? No way am I staying here! I left my stuff in your shitty car, okay? Don't leave us here! I can explain! He'll wake up and tell you it was consensual. He wanted it. You big whores! - They take their time. - Forever. He'll be here soon. It's normal. Here he comes. Thanks. Dad! How you doing? I miss you. - All right, champ? - You okay? - Fly! - Check it out. You got yours, too? - Great to see you. - Same here. I miss you. - You good? - How are you, son? I'm good. - How you doing? - Good, and you? Let me look at you, champ. Look at you! Big and strong and all. You're growing too fast. They'll kick us out. - They won't. - They will! It's his birthday. Thank you. So how's it going? I got good grades. 14.5/20. Overall average? Great! We're pleased. - Proud of him. - Me too. Bravo. Even English, you passed? I got 10/20. We're there, helping him. Specially Granny, in English. Sure. Come again? I want him to speak English. You help him? I can't speak English. I speak French, be happy. I passed it, at least. Sure, that's the main thing. Besides that, it's over with Carmen. Well, before it started. How come? I took her to a snack bar, and after we ate, I said, Well, then? You want to? She's like, No. She wants to wait. Wait for what? I don't know. She's not... Not ready. She was expecting a white wedding? You have no time for love. You've got to study. It's okay... Build your future. And then, think of love. Girls will come along. Look at me, I wasn't looking, she stuck to me. You weren't looking? I wasn't looking. She chased after me. I'll tell you all about it. - You bet. - She lay in wait. Don't lie. Ask Mom. Ask Granny! Downstairs, shouting, Ellyes, I love you! I promise, she was full-on. I have a gift for you. I wrote a poem. You did? Granny said you used to be a poet. I wrote stuff, I wasn't a poet. Yes, and you have talent. Why tell him that? I'll show him. - Don't show him that. - Why? You'll have to pay royalties. Royalties? To you? You're Beethoven, Picasso, or something? Picasso's a painter. Same difference, they're artists. Okay, listen... For My Dad Today's a special day for you It's a day of celebration for me too This magical date sums up all you mean to me Happy birthday, Dad My heart is full of emotions When I was a boy, you were my king You were in the sky and the stars for me Even today, Dad, you're an important marker This poem sends all my wishes to the best father Thanks. You liked it? Keep it, won't you? Forever. Over my bed. You're my most important marker. Thank you. I appreciate it. I want us to play soccer again. As soon as I'm out, inshallah. I miss you. I miss you, too. Hello, Nora. Hello, children. You had another fall? How are you? I'll go to work. You'll come back? Of course. You'll be fine. Get some rest. And I'll be back to see you. Rest. Bye, Salomon. - Bye, children. - Wait, Nora. - Hi, Granny. - My little ones! How are you? You gave us a fright. Raising hell again. Thanks for staying till I got here. It's normal. - You're working now? - The night shift. How do you get there? Bus, as usual. To the airport. - It's still running? - All night. I'm used to it. Take a cab, on me. Take a cab. Not to work. I always catch the bus. I'll take you, and leave my mother. - Stay with your mother. - In that case, you take a cab. I'm used to the bus. Anyway, thanks again, Nora. You're welcome. - Look after your mom. - We'll try. Bye, Salomon. This is so good! Very good even! Delicious! Who knew you were such a good cook! You eat it with bread? Always. Italians eat it with bread? Generally, yes. Two things are on every table in Italy. Bread. And wine. There you go. Not for me. I don't eat bread. For us, it's bread and a fizzy drink. Today, this takes me back to Italy. Next time, you'll have to make that famous soup of yours. Chorba? I never tried it. I'd really like to. I'll make some. I told him about it yesterday. He'd never heard of it. The guys want chorba. Atou, can you make chorba? With love, right. We don't make it. All right. You never know. They're too busy dancing coupé-décalé. - No way! - For sure. We have good recipes, too. There's attieke. Cassava couscous. It accompanies fish or meat. Or we'd make you fried banana. Delicious, dipped in tomato sauce! Talk's fine, but bring it in to taste. I will do next time. Nora bakes cakes for us. Luigi brings in canestrelli. Marco... Nothing. All I bring you guys is my love. All I have, I bring for you. Isn't that beautiful, though! Next time, I'll bring some in. I'll finish, okay? Go for it. Look, it's my third helping. Maybe you're right. Maybe there's a baby. For real? A little bambino? Great! So you're eating for two. It's scary. Have you seen this? Can we say congratulations? Luigi, until I'm sure, definitely not. A new baby uncorks the belly. Nora, you okay? I'm okay. Eat. I think this is a fine opportunity... after the wonderful Italian pasta cooked for us by Lila, to give you this envelope. The whole team chipped in. For your son's birthday. Happy birthday from the team. Happy birthday to your son. Thank you. I'm touched. We all love you. I love you all, too. Much respect, Nora. Exactly. I hope it's all sorted out very soon. Yes. It's not much but it's from the heart. You are family to me. I love you all. Keep calm, we're a family. - All the very best. - Thanks. You're a strong woman. It's okay, Nora. Really. We'll always be here. I'll pray for your son next week at... On my pilgrimage, I'll pray for him. Have strength. You'll get him back soon. Have strength. May God protect you, children. All right, Nora. Please. Amen. May God protect you, too. Amen. Hello, ma'am. - I'm looking for Mrs. Allouch. - Are you family? As good as family. Take a seat. And I'll explain. Mrs. Allouch passed away this morning. Cardiac arrest. No way. I'm very sorry. Really sorry. That makes me so sad. Same here. She was family. Of course. She was one of our family. All she did for us, over the years. Life goes on, though. Yes, but I feel such pain. Sure, same here. I feel such pain. You'll get over it. We're only passing through on earth. I called her son. To return the keys. How's he taking it? Okay. He said she left me something. An inheritance? No, the poor woman wasn't wealthy. What inheritance? I don't know. But she thought of me, left me something. Kind of her. Poor woman. Stay strong. I need you. Yema. As long as I'm upright, I'll stay strong. It'll all work out, son.
