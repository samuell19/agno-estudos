Goodnight, Guy. And thanks for an awfully nice evening. Goodnight. See you tomorrow? You haven't the slightest chance of avoiding it. Until tomorrow. Goodnight. Oh. Did I waken you, darling? I meant to be very quiet. Too quiet, my dear. Such overplaying of wifely solicitude might easily be misunderstood. If you are hinting that I was sneaking in .. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters anymore. The time has come when words fail to have meaning. When only what one feels is important. I am going to kill you, Ruth. I have to. No .. no! At that point, the dream always ends, doctor. How often have you had these dreams, Mr Bennet? Five or six times. Every night for the past week in fact. Have you mentioned them to anyone? To your wife in particular. A recurrent dream in which I brutally beat my wife with a perfume bottle .. Is hardly a cheerful topic for the breakfast table. Hardly. Are they always the same? Always. What is your profession, may I ask? I am a writer. Of the better type of fiction, I hope. Well, isn't it entirely possible that this dream, as you call it .. Is merely the subconscious development of another story plot? I rarely if ever dwell on the macabre, Dr Redmond. Mr Bennet, I am going to ask you some personal questions. You understand of course that .. Anything said here will be treated in the strictest confidence. Well, I don't know. Miss Kramer is entirely trustworthy. She has been with me four years. So I should know. Very well, doctor. I will do my best. But first. How is your health? Physically I am quite fit. Mentally? Mentally, I am frightened to death. Doctor. Do you think it possible that I might .. Slip my cables some night and .. Actually murder your wife? Yes. It is possible. Fortunately, you've had the good sense to take the matter in hand in time. Now, tell me. Are you unduly worried about anything? - I am worried about this dream. I suppose you would call it a 'fear dream'. There is no such thing as a 'fear dream'. Mr Bennet. There are only 'wish dreams'. Are you telling me that I wish to kill my wife? Not consciously perhaps. But your subconscious mind could be entertaining such a thought. Nonsense. I love my wife. Perhaps. And all men kill the thing they love. Some do it with a bitter look. Some with a flattering word. Or a quart-sized perfume bottle? Less romantic but just as practical. You reasoning is quite as bad as your rendition of Wilde Redmond. I resent them both. I apologise for the poetry but not for my reasoning, Mr Bennet. Does your wife return your affection? It is my honest conviction that she hates me thoroughly. Faithful? - Is she? I wouldn't know. Perhaps you covet your wife's jewelry? Now wouldn't I look fine walking about .. With a $100,000-worth of jewelry adorning my person. You could convert that jewelry into cash if you happened to need money. Do you? Frankly, yes. However, I can always get an advance from my publisher. Anything else? Would you like to know the color of my father's hair? Or my favorite breakfast dish? Kippers if that is any help. That is all for today, thanks. But I would like you back again on Thursday at four. I suppose I can manage it. By the way, Mr Bennet. Do you occupy a bedroom with your wife? Now look here, doctor. - I mention it merely as a precaution. Sleep in the guest room if you have one. You can make some excuse. I grasp your point. Yes. I think I can manage it. - Good. See you on Thursday. Thank you. I must have a talk with his wife. Call her please, and if she isn't in .. Leave word that it's imperative that I see her at once. Tonight if possible. - Yes, sir. I .. hope you didn't mind my little lie. About the four years? Well, If I'd said you'd been with me only four weeks I'd have scared him off. It doesn't matter. Now look here, Merrick. It isn't as if I am some inconsequential pulp scribbler asking for a handout. This is Alton Bennet speaking. I have got to have at least ten thousand dollars. Is that your final answer? But .. Nonsense. You've plenty of time. - But I really should get away. You can come in for a minute. - Fine. Oh hello. Have a good day? Excellent. How about you, Bayard? Any luck? - Not bad. Seeing we only got there in time for the last two races. Guy won $180 on a horse. Just because he liked the arch of his neck. That is me. Always the architect thinking in terms of line. Sit down, Guy. - Thanks. You arrived only in time for the last two races? Yes. We drove down to the beach property first. Again. Well, we thought it best to have another look at the building site. It was a wonderful day really. Wasn't it, Guy? It certainly was. I hope you know what you are doing, my dear. I know exactly what I am doing. I am building a beach house for my husband. So he will have a nice quiet place to work. Really? I was under the impression you were doing it to provide my Bayard .. With an architect's commission. Now look here. - Pay no attention to him, Guy. He is showing you his better side. After four drinks he is really detestable. I'll be running along now if you don't mind. Not at all. And. These. Are beginning to look a little frayed, aren't they. What is the life expectancy of a set of blueprints anyway? I'm sorry. Pick us up at eight, Guy. We're stopping by the Mallorys first for cocktails. Alright. You were in excellent form tonight. I am looking forward to a most enjoyable evening. I am sorry to disappoint you but I am not going. You don't expect me to stay at home? - Oh no, my dear. I wouldn't deprive you of an opportunity to make a vulgar display of yourself. Go ahead. Deck yourself out like some cheap little carnival biddy. You are so obvious. You hate my jewels because you can't have them. Stop encouraging Bayard. In what way? Well, you know I haven't the money to build this beach place. You have got to forget it. Oh that. I thought you were going to say I had to stop seeing Guy. Hello Kenny. Miss. Yes? Thank you. Goodnight. Come on, kids. Let me by. Hello, Poppet. Do you miss me? I love you. 7:30. Time to go to sleep. Goodnight, darling. [ Door knocks ] Hello Karl. - Hello, Kitten. Come on in. - Thanks. How are you tonight? I'm tired. Maybe you don't feel like a show? My feelings have nothing to do with it. Dr Redmond wants me back at the office at 9 o'clock for an interview. Again? What's the matter with that boss of yours? Doesn't he have a home? He hasn't much of one, no. His wife is still in Santa Barbara. Why don't you take off your coat and relax while I fix us something to eat. Well, I won't have time to go out. You like chow mein? Like it? I invented it. - Good. Turn on the radio or play a record or something. Thanks. Coffee or tea? Oh, tea sounds swell. [ Radio music ] You know, a thing like this could grow on a fellow. Music. Home-cooked food. I like the smell of your hair, Kitten. You'd better help me set the table. Here. Put these things away will you. What gives with you? Meet any interesting crackpots today? Our clients are not crackpots. They are mental cases. - Okay. Mental cases. How many wives with guilty consciences did you interview? None. Today was "husband's guilty conscience" day. There was one in particular that was out of the ordinary. Yeah? Yes. He dreams every night that he beats his wife to death with a perfume bottle. I suppose that means he's suffering from suppressed hatred of his mother-in-law. Or something. Dr Redmond seems to think that he has his wife's jewels on his mind. His subconscious mind, that is. They are worth a hundred thousand dollars. That's why I return to the office tonight. The doctor wants so have a talk with his client's wife. Can't you put something on a little less nerve-shattering? Sure. Anything new in the detective business today? A fellow came in to see me about framing his wife for a divorce action. You couldn't be such a heel. Why not? It is a legitimate racket. Racket is right. The next thing you know you'll be stealing pennies from blind old ladies. The blind old ladies I know don't have any pennies. You should have stayed on the police force. At least you were in good company. But there is no future in it. When you're 43 you make Sergeant. You make $318 a month. Uhuh. That isn't money. Well, I guess you are old enough to know what you are doing. Sure I know what I am doing, Kitten. I am after fancy dough. I'll show you what I mean when I get paid off for a job I did last month. That reminds me, honey. I almost forgot something. Will you give me five minutes? Yes. But not any longer. The things will be ready then. - Word of honor, Kitten. Five minutes. Papers. Get your papers. Paper, mister? Paper. Paper. Latest edition. Paper. Paper. Night edition. Paper. Open up, Charlie. Make impressions of these quickly. [ Police radio: ] "Car 12R. Out to City Hall." "Car 14. What is your location now?" I'll be back for the dupes later. "Car 135T. Can you handle the call?" "Car 43. Out to the station." "Car 135T. Amsterdam and 63rd." "Traffic accident." Papers. Papers. Get your paper here. Paper. Paper. Yes, sir. How am I doing, Kitten? Hold you up? Just in time. The chow mein is ready. I'll have to hurry you or I'll be late. Why Karl, how nice. What is the matter? Don't you like me? It isn't that, Karl. I just want to make sure. I couldn't stand to be wrong a second time. Sure, Kitten. I understand. It's just nine now. I had better step on it. Want me to stick around? You'd better not. I will be pretty late. Thanks for walking over with me. The pleasure is all mine, Kitten. You'd better come with me, Guy. I've never met this doctor Redmond before. Alright. Doctor Redmond: "Good. See you on Thursday". Thank you, Miss Kramer. You may go. And .. Put the Bennet folder back in the files please. Yes, sir. Well, Mrs Bennet. What do you make of it? The whole thing is too ridiculous for words. Alton just ate something that disagreed with him and passed a bad night or two. I do the same thing occasionally. And do you dream of murdering your husband, Mrs Bennet? Oh, often. Even when I am not asleep. No, Dr Redmond, I am not afraid of my husband. There is nothing wrong with him a good night's sleep .. And a royalty check won't cure. Believe me. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs Bennett. Well, what is it all about if I'm not being to too personal? It seems that my husband is troubled by a recurrent dream .. In which he beats my brains out with a perfume bottle. You don't mean it? At least that's what this Dr Redmond or whatever his name is, says. Frightening, isn't it. I've heard of such things but this is the first time I have .. You don't think there is any truth in what that man says, do you? How would I know? Does he have any explanation for this dream your husband is having? Yes. Something about Alton wanting my jewels. You mean they are real? They're insured for a hundred thousand. A hundred thousand? Well, what do you know. And all the time I thought they were five and dime glitter. Just to make the lady look pretty. You make me feel like a corpse already. I am sorry. I didn't mean to. Well, I have a feeling I am going to drink much too much tonight. [ Laughter ] Shut up. Quiet. [ Bell ] [ Police radio: ] "Car 61A .. 390." A nice haul, eh Charlie? Well? What do you say, Charlie? Well. For these little ones, I'll give 1,100 dollars. But what about the other pieces? I you are smart you'll dump them in the nearest ash-can. What is the matter with you, Charlie? You gone crazy? Just playing it safe, kid. There is a murder rap hanging over this junk. What do you mean? - That's right. Murder. Over at the Crayford Arms. Yeah. A load of fancy rocks is missing. I heard it on a police call. They'll have a list of everything. You got nothing to worry about, Charlie. I didn't murder anyone for this ice. I ain't saying you did. I'm just saying this junk is hot. They are specially designed pieces. And they're registered with an insurance company. You can bet on that. Get rid of them. That's my advice. Stop playing me for a dope and give me the $1,100. Play it smart like I said. Fast. You are not talking to a cluck, Charlie. You're talking to a guy who knows all the angles. I got everything all planned out. Very, very carefully. Morning, Kitten. - Morning, Karl. Work late last night? - Not very. See you later. Oh, Kitten. I almost forgot. Here is your money. And thanks. But you only borrowed five. Interest, baby. Buy yourself a present. You know, you're not half the heel you pretend to be, Karl. And you have only known me six weeks. Wait. Well, the extra five will make a payment on a coat I've been buying. You can have it back anytime you want. I won't need it. I'm loaded. That client I was telling you about paid off this morning. And it is burning a hole in my pocket. You'll find a way to spend it. - That's what I'm afraid of. Oh, Kitten. Have you got a bank account? Yes. Yes I have some savings. Then do me a favor, baby. Put this away for me and dole it out as I need it. There is a grand here. A thousand dollars? Are you sure? - Of course I am sure. If I hold on to it I'm liable to go on a binge and blow it all at once. You keep it for me. Well. Okay. I'll deposit it during my lunch hour. Swell. Goodbye, Kitten. - Goodbye. It's as I say. If you stop using the car long enough I can get the brakes fixed. What do people do, stand around and wait for a murder? I am sure all these people .. Dawson, Homicide. They've been waiting for you. - Yeah, I know. I grabbed a couple of hours sleep last night. I won't let it happen again. Fayle. Homicide Bureau. Photos. Alright. Stand back, folks. Dawson, Homicide. Don't fool around with that. Let's go upstairs for the bedroom stuff. Hey, Hal. Come on. Look, you heard what the officer said. You ought to stay downstairs. Why does everybody hear about these things before we do? Well, is this strictly an invitational affair? Or can anybody horn in? Where is Wilson? - Here, Lieutenant. I was just locking the service door to keep anybody from leaving. Are you sure everybody is here? We don't want to overlook anyone, do we. You are Alton Bennet I take it? You take it correctly. I am Lieutenant Dawson. Homicide Bureau. That does not excuse your bad manners. Kindly take off your hat and stop shouting. Sorry. Lieutenant. The Coroner is here and the ambulance. Okay. Would you mind taking us upstairs Mr Bennet? Alright. Henry. Could you get me another cup of coffee. - Yes, sir. Come along, Coroner. In there. Sit here, Sergeant. Keep that mob outside. It's about time you were getting on the job, Dawson. It's him alright. No. Not you again. It so happens that my company holds a policy on the lady's jewels. Okay, Cooper. If there is a stick pin missing, you will be notified .. Through the proper channels. Now beat it. Your slip is showing. Okay fellows, get to work. See if you can establish the time. A hundred thousand dollar policy, Lieutenant. And the jewels are missing. That perfume bottle was undoubtedly the lethal weapon. And I've a hunch you will find some interesting prints on it. Thanks for the apple. What time was your wife's body discovered, Mr Bennet? About 07:30 this morning. By you? - No. By the maid. Who was the first to notice that the jewels were missing? The maid. I was too .. too shocked to notice anything. Who else was in the house at the time? - The butler. Henry. Ask them both to come here. Was your wife wearing her jewelry last night? Yes. - You sure? Of course I'm sure. Remember the exact number of pieces? Quiet, Cooper. Did you sleep in this room last night, Mr Bennet? No. Neither bed has been used as you can see for yourself. Well, where did you sleep? In the guest room down the hall. Did you see your wife come in? No. Did you hear her come in? No. I was sleeping too soundly. When was the last time you saw your wife wearing her jewels, Mr Bennet? I think it was about 08:30 when they left the house, wasn't it Christine? Yes, sir. Who do you mean "they"? My wife and a Mr Guy Bayard. A friend of the family? Not exactly. He is an architect who my wife has engaged to design a beach house. I see. Where can he be reached? I think he has some office in the Stope Studios in Chatham Place. Are you in the habit of sleeping the guest room, Mr Bennet? No. I usually share this room with my wife. What made you decide to sleep in the guest room last night? I .. I haven't been sleeping too well lately. You may as well know the truth. You will dig it out sooner or later. I slept in the guest room because I was afraid. Afraid of what? Of myself. I have been having horrible nightmares lately. Terrible dreams in which I murder my wife. With a perfume bottle? Yes. That's why I knew before I went in there what I would find. Ruth in a crumpled heap on the floor. And beside her head the perfume bottle. It was horrible. Worse even that the dreams. That is why I went to Dr Redmond. Those dreams were driving me crazy. I was afraid of losing my mind or of doing her some harm during my sleep. Thank heaven I know it wasn't me. How do you know? I wasn't able to sleep. I asked Henry to bring me the sleeping tablets. Two would ordinarily be sufficient but I was desperate for relief. I took four. Anybody witness it? Henry. Yes, sir. I cautioned him about taking so many but he took them just the same. Any of those tablets left? Yes, sir. I put the bottle in the cabinet. Get it. I'd day she has been dead about six hours, Lieutenant. Which would place the time of the slaying around .. Two-thirty. There will be an inquest of course, Mr Bennet. Naturally. There is not much to go on. Some prints on the perfume bottle not Mrs Bennet's. We'll check them downtown. You will probably find they are mine. When I went in there this morning I picked it up. Looked at it. I started to put it on the dressing table. In my nervousness it hit the edge of the table and slipped from grasp. Wait outside. "When necessary take one for relief." "Take two .." In this dream of yours, Mr Bennet. Did you have any particular reason for murdering your wife? Jealousy, or jewels? You know what I mean? None that I could ever recall. That's why I went to Dr Redmond. I thought he might help me. In other words you wanted to ensure your tale of the dream was put on the record. I don't like the insinuation, Mr Dawson. I went to Dr Redmond, a psychiatrist, for help. Not as you seem to imply, to establish an alibi. In a murder case, Mr Bennet. Anybody that crossed your wife's path is a suspect. I may want to talk to you again. You mean, I am not under arrest? Not yet. But until the tablets have been analysed I wouldn't leave town if I were you. Get Bennet's prints. Check them at headquarters. Yes, sir. Cover the maid's and the butler too. What you got to say, Lieutenant? - Is Bennet guilty? Your guess is as good as mine. What's the name of the boyfriend she was out with? Guy Bayard. An architect. What is Bennet's alibi? Overdose of sleeping tablets. You guys want an angle? - Yeah, sure. This is a dilly. Bennet claims he dreamed he murdered his wife every night last week. So he went to a psychiatrist to find out what it meant. Oh boy. What a story. Hey, boss. Do you think that maybe I'll have time to get the brakes fixed now? Take care of him. - Sure, Lieutenant. That says 'Private'. About time, Lieutenant. The Doc doesn't feel so hot. I just broke the bad news. That is very kind of you, Mr Cooper. I don't know what I would do without you. This is Lieutenant Dawson, Homicide. Dr Redmond. I cannot believe it. It is too fantastic. And yet I had a feeling this was going to happen. That is why I called Mrs Bennet here. To put her on her guard. Sergeant Fayle. Homicide too. About that dream of Bennet's, doctor Redmond. Did you keep a transcript of it? Yes. In my files. But I may as well tell you that the transcript is missing. Who has access to your files besides yourself? My secretary, Miss Kramer. Where is she? I sent her home. She had a bad headache. I wasn't feeling too well either so I cancelled my appointments to let her go. Where does she live, doctor? On Green Street, just off Broome. 414 I think. How long has she been gone? Nearly half an hour. Did that have anything to do with cancelling your engagements? Yes, it did. I had a little accident last night. That's what I'd like to hear about, Doc. Last night. Where were you between midnight and say .. 4am this morning? At home in bed. Can you prove it? It would be more difficult for you to prove that I wasn't. When Bennet told you his dream, doctor. Did you get the feeling that he was interested in his wife's jewels? He considered them vulgar. At least in bad taste. Was Mrs Bennet wearing her jewelry when she came here last night? Will you close your trap about those jewels. When we find the murderer, we'll find the jewels. And vice-versa maybe. - Quiet. How did you get that bump on your head? After my interview with Mrs Bennet I went for a walk. And crossing Gramercy Park I slipped and .. Struck my head. Speaking of Mrs Bennet. Was she alone? No. She was with a Mr Bayard. Well, where was he while you were talking with Mrs Bennet? In here. Could he have heard anything that was said between you two? I am not sure. The door was closed. Go in there and say a few words in a conversational tone. Just the way you were talking to Mrs Bennet. And close the door after you. Sit in the same chair too please. No. All kidding aside, Cooper. Who tipped you off? Like I told you, Bill. I had your desk wired. If I ever find a leak in my office somebody is going to lose their job. Don't look at me. Don't get you ulcers in an uproar, Bill. The desk clerk at the Crayford Arms is a pal of mine. He tipped me off the moment the call went through. I advise you not to antagonise your husband. I am afraid you don't realize how serious his condition is. Do you hear me? We heard you alright. Every word. Okay, Doc. That takes care of you. For a while. Now, about this secretary of yours. How long has she worked for you? - Four weeks. What kind of references did she have? Excellent. - Still got them? I think so. Yes. Here they are. You know anything about her family? No. Nothing. She came from Los Angeles. Funny you would hire a strange girl. That you didn't know and .. And give her access to the secrets of those files .. Without thoroughly checking on her references first. What are you driving at? They are forged. All signed by the same hand. - I don't believe it. Whether you believe it or not it is true. You're not going to bother Miss Kramer are you? Why not? Good heavens, man. Surely you know who killed Ruth Bennet? No. Who? - Why, her husband. Did you hear that, Coop? The Doc here said .. Where is that guy? Well, what are you standing there for? Let's go. Paper. Read all about it. Paper. Paper. Read all about it. [ Police siren ] See what I mean? We're just lucky. That's all. How about this? Talk to him. He is the driver. What you putting the guy on me for? You can't fool around with taxicab companies. They'll screw you. They'll screw the city. Believe me. Here I am, standing here and minding my own business. And these cops come along. I ain't mad at anybody. Believe me, I'm not. Now what am I going to do about the boss? This is the third time this week I got hit. I'm sure I'll never get paid. I know that. 2B. Hey .. C3. [ Door knocks ] I'm the gut they'll call on the carpet. They don't blame you. Thank you. Wasn't that Cooper? Now look here, Cooper .. I beg your pardon. - Won't you come in? Thanks. Miss Kramer, may I present my colleague and bosom companion. Lieutenant Dawson of Homicide. Lieutenant - Miss Kramer. Pleased to meet you, Miss Kramer. - How do you do. Sergeant Fayle. Homicide too. You will have to excuse the place. This is cleaning day. Won't you sit down? - Thanks. Dr Redmond said he sent you home with a bad headache. I am glad it is better. Yes. I .. Feel much better since I had a cup of coffee. And very good coffee too, I might add. I suppose chum here has told you the news? I was shocked to hear about Miss Bennet. She was a beautiful woman. How long have you .. - You can skip the preliminaries. Miss Kramer already gave me the pertinent facts. Such as age, birthplace, favorite sport. Likes Gershwin and that she is not married. I will do the questioning for the police department. You just stick to your insurance investigating. Thank you, Mr Cooper. Who had access to those files besides you and Dr Redmond, Miss Kramer? No-one. What time did you get home last night? About .. ten. Were you the last one to leave the office? Dr Redmond and I left together. You came from Los Angeles didn't you, Miss Kramer? That is right. Who did you work for out there? Oh. Several different people. Firms. - I see. Why did you come here? Well, I .. I got tired of California. I wanted a change. That's all. Everyone needs a change once in a while. You might try it yourself sometime. Just what do you want to know, Mr Dawson? Just one thing, Miss Kramer. When you came here to look for a job. Yes? Were you running away from something? No. Then why did you have to forge references? Forged? Yeah, junior. You got a bad habit of running off too soon. You ought to learn to stick around. Well, Miss Kramer? Get out, Mr Dawson. You too Mr Cooper. Okay. But those references were forged, Miss Kramer. And crudely at that. I was hoping you would explain without forcing my hand. I don't want to book you on suspicion of murder unless you make me. But there is nothing to explain. I .. I had to leave California in a hurry and I needed a job and I .. I couldn't get one without references so I had some made up. How did you get the job with Dr Redmond, Miss Kramer? Through a friend of mine who lives right here in this building. What is your friend's name? - Benson. Karl Benson. He lives right down in the second floor front: 2A. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Miss Kramer. Come on, Sergeant. I'm sorry. I wish that there was .. - There isn't. See you again sometime. I hope. Well .. do you still think she makes good coffee? I thought her explanation for those references made pretty good sense. Don't let those sultry eyes of hers throw you, son. She hasn't told half of what she knows yet. We might as well check with her friend while we are here. Wait downstairs. Do you think I would have time .. No. I guess not. Are you Karl Benson? Yeah. I am Lieutenant Dawson. Homicide. This is Joe Cooper. Investigator for Underwrites Casualty. Glad to know you, Lieutenant. You too, Cooper. - How are you? Sit down. Grab a chair. Here. Thanks. Do you mind if I finish shaving? Go ahead. What can I do for you fellows, if anything? Do you know the Kramer girl upstairs? Sure. A nice kid. Not too bright, maybe. But a very sweet personality. Why? Know anything about her background? Not much. She moved in here about six weeks ago. Did you ever hear her say anything about serving time? Nah. She is straight. What is the matter? Nothing. I was just thinking about some water. What do you use for a .. Oh, I got it. Here. Let me fill it up for you. No, never mind. I don't like that faucet water. You writing a bond or something on her, Cooper? No. I am working on the Bennet case. Maybe you heard about it. Oh yeah. I just read about it in the paper. The Bennet dame got knocked off. Yeah, that's right. - I get it. Your company holds the policy on the missing ice? Yeah. Say, in case you didn't know it this thing is blocked up. It is probably empty. I never touch it myself. No. There's water in it alright. It is full right up to here. Here. Let me pour you a real drink. No, skip it. How do you figure the kid upstairs is in this? You got her a job with Dr Redmond, didn't you? Yeah, that's right. I heard about the opening and took her up. For a slight commission. Any idea who fixed up her references? No. Why? They were phony. Phony? How do you like that? Say, you don't think the kid is mixed up in the murder, do you? Well, she had access to the files and she knew about the dream. She and Bennet and Redmond. And Bayard. Don't overlook him. Say, maybe you got something. Maybe that's the way to lay your dough. Straight across the board on Bayard, the dame's boyfriend. Look. If I get a lead on this case and help break it .. Will Underwriters Casualty pay off? To you? Yeah, sure. I used to be on the force. I'm in business for myself now in a small way. Private investigations. Ask him. How about it? Well, I'm in no position to commit the company .. But I suppose they'd pay up to ten percent on the $100,000. The insured value of the jewelry. Who can laugh at ten grand? This is where I go to work. I'm sure glad you fellows dropped in. Always glad to talk shop with some of the boys. I'll be seeing you. - Yeah. So long. - So long. So long, Cooper. Drop in. Anytime. [ Door knocks ] Hello, Kitten. I heard your vacuum. How come you are home today? Doctor Redmond wasn't feeling very well. He cancelled all of his appointments and gave me the day off. May I come in? You don't mind if I go on with my work? - No. Go right ahead. They didn't try to push you around, did they? Who? - Those Dicks. Did they talk to you too? - Yeah, they tried to pump me. As if I'd put out anything. I told them you were a straight kid. There is nothing else you can say under the circumstances, is there? I wouldn't have anyway, Kitten. Not for all the tea in China. Thanks. That makes us even. Because I didn't tell them you furnished me with the forged references either. You know what I think? No. What? I think the husband bumped her off. Don't you? I don't care whether he did or he didn't. I have answered all the questions I am going to for one day, Karl. Now will you please leave so I can finish my work. Sure, Kitten. Sorry I bothered you. You want anything from uptown? - No thanks. If those Dicks come around again tell them to get lost. I am sorry I am so grumpy. That's okay. Be seeing you. Hey, Bill. Would you like to take a look at these? - What you got? Photostat copies of the Bennet woman's jewelry taken from the insurance policy. I've had copies distributed to all the pawn shops. If just one piece of that turns up we are set. You mean to tell me a woman wore all that junk on her at one time? I know. It's disgusting but true. I got Bayard inside. Let's hear his story. Give us an overall picture of your movements Mr Bayard. Form the time you left with Mrs Bennet until say, around six in the morning. There is no reason why I shouldn't. I called for the Bennets around 8:20 .. And learned from Mrs Bennet that her husband wasn't going. I'd gathered they had had words over it. Anyway, we went to the Mallorys for cocktails and .. Mrs Bennet asked me to go along with her to Dr Redmond's office. She had been in gay spirits until after we left there, but .. Then she became moody and wanted to drink. Did you hear what Dr Redmond said to Mrs Bennet? Enough to know they were discussing her husband. It wasn't until after we left that she told me about the dream business. I might add that she seemed rather frightened. Well, where did you go then? Back to the Mallorys but .. Ruth thought it was dull and got up a party to go nightclubbing. We went to the Blue Heron. Go on. Well. Mrs Bennet got kind-of high. And made such a scene the management asked us to leave. Now look here, Bayard .. - Just a minute. Mr Bennet. Go on. I don't drive myself so I put her in a cab and took her home. "However, she kept arguing until she .." "She got me worked up to the point where .." "Frankly, I could have cheerfully throttled her." "When we got to her apartment house." "I think it was around two o'clock." "I told the driver to wait and took her in." "She had a little trouble finding her key and wouldn't let me help her." "Finally she found it and I opened the door." "I put her in the elevator. She still wanted to argue, but I .." "I left her there and went out." "I got in the cab and drove away." That was the last time I saw her, Lieutenant. Where did you go then? - Home. Was Mrs Bennet wearing these when you left? Yes. I recognise most of them. All except that signet ring there but .. She would hardly be wearing that. - Hardly. Did anybody see you take Mrs Bennet home? There was a fellow in the lobby talking to a girl. I believe he lived there. I have seen him several times. He may have recognised me. - You recall his name? I don't believe I ever heard it. Well, I guess that's about all. For the time being at least. Thanks for coming down, Bayard. - Not at all. He is lying about Ruth. I have never known her to drink to excess. Well, you can check his story at the Blue Heron easy enough. I shall. And if Guy Bayard is lying. He shall answer to me. Not to the police. The more I see of him the more I feel he is putting on a terrific act. If I just had one bit of good evidence. That signet ring, Bill. Mrs Bennet wasn't wearing it and yet it is missing. Now. Only three people knew where she kept her jewelry. Her husband, the maid and the butler. You can toss out the last two. They go home at night. I checked their stories. It's airtight. - So is Bennet's. I had those sleeping pills analysed .. And four of them would knock you out like a scoopful of ether. Unless maybe the system had become immune from repeated doses. According to the butler that wasn't the case with Bennet. Dawson. Yes? Yes. Yes, dear. Of course I am busy, Stella. Well, why don't you send Judy? Oh. She is practising her piano. No, don't stop her. Let her get it over with before I get home. Yeah? Yeah. Bread? Yeah. A pound of tomatoes. Ground round. Yes. I'm writing it down, Stella. Yes. Goodbye. Immune. Bill. Immune. You got something. Yeah, I have. I got a headache. Well, goodnight, fellahs. Goodnight, boss. - I'm going home. Ground round. Bill. Come over to the police dispensary with me first. I got an idea. - It's too late for ideas. I want to get a good night's sleep. - It'll only take a minute. Now come on. Yeah. Yes, Stella. Why sure, but .. Ground round? Yeah, I thought it was something round. Sure I wrote it down Stella, but .. Okay. Be home right away. Look, Doc. This catalytic agent business is all very interesting. But if you don't mind, forget it a minute. Now. What we must know is this: Could Bennet have taken anything before he took sleeping pills .. To counteract their effect? That's a very interesting point you bring up. Will you step on it Doc please. You know the butcher's ships close at 6 o'clock. How many sleeping pills did Bennet take? - He took four. Yes. If he had taken two Benzedrine tablets of 5-milligrams each. Before taking the sleeping tablets. The sleeping tablets wouldn't have had any effect on him whatsoever. Well then, Bennet is our man. The Doc here just busted his alibi wide open. Yes. But did you ever hear of this stunt being pulled before? No .. but I am sure it is possible. You have Benzedrine tablets handy, Doc? - Sure. We have some of them. Then let's try it on me. I don't mind being a guinea pig. Where are they, Doc? - I got them here. But I got to make out a prescription, you know. Here we are. There. Two Benzedrine. You know Bill. This is very, very interesting. In my years in this dispensary I don't recall a case like this before. Do you? It will be very interesting if I get home without the groceries. Now, where are those sleeping pills that you analysed for Bill? I got them right here. Yeah. Exhibit 22C. Can I have four of them? - Well .. okay, Bill? Yeah. Give him anything he wants. Alright. There you are. Four. Will you join me, Lieutenant? I don't mind if I do. If they are on the house. But you can skip the Benzedrine. I want to get a good night's sleep. Now we'll see if Bennet could have stayed awake .. In spite of his having had those sleeping pills. No, if you fellows will excuse me. I will go home and get a good night's sleep. What are you doing here? Oh. There is a pawnshop on Green Street .. That reports picking up a piece of the Bennet jewels. I thought I would tell you. - You thought! Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go. Thanks, Doc. We'll let you know how this works out. Right. - See you later. It is one of Mrs Bennet's alright. A family crest ring. What name did she give? Name? Let me see. Jane Smith. But that doesn't mean anything. That is a popular name in a pawn shop. Did you ever see her before? No. But I got an idea she lives in the neighborhood. She was carrying a black and white striped jacket. And a black skirt on a cleaners' hanger. That's an idea, son. We'll search ever cleaning establishment in the neighborhood. I'll take care of this. What is the trouble with you? Do you feel sleepy? No. I feel fine. I took the Benzedrine first. Remember? No. I am sorry but we haven't had a black and white sports jacket lately. Why don't you take your friend home and let him sleep it off. A good idea, ma'am. Come on, father. Curfew is ringing. Sort of a black-and-white sports outfit. A black and white sport outfit? Yes. I remember that. Yes. It went out this afternoon. A very nice young lady. - Bill, did you hear that? Have you got the lady's name and address? Let's see. Yes. Kramer is the name. She lives up the street in a brownstone. Second from the corner. What did I tell you, kid? An inside job. Come on. If you don't mind I'd like to take that slip. It's all yours. - Thanks. Hey fellows, come and get him. Take him home to bed. Let him sleep it off. He's going to be hopping mad he missed his dinner. He'll be hopping mad he missed the Kramer girl. I'll phone the old buzzard tomorrow. Phil, tail him. Don't let him out of your sight. Sure, Sergeant. I never knew the boss to take a drink. I don't get it. Come on, Lieutenant. Let's go home. [ Door knocks ] Hello. Hello. May I come in? I guess so. Thanks. Are you going out? In a moment. I am just trying on a new coat. It is very pretty. Thanks. Well? I'd like to talk to you for a bit. Won't you .. Excuse me a minute. What do you think? She is lovely. You know, there's a look about the eyes. - She is my .. Well, I was going to say she is my baby. But she is quite a young lady now. Three years old. - You are very lucky. I think I am. Where is she now? In California with my mother. I am going to bring her here as soon as I can afford to. Well, Mr Cooper. What is it you wanted to talk to me about? Lots things. Including the Bennet case. But why don't we gab over a plate of spaghetti? I know a nice .. Nice, quiet little Italian place right near here? Who doesn't? How about it? Alright. Everything is alright? - Fine. Thanks. Say, there is a copper named Wilson hanging round outside. Make him a sandwich or something with my compliments. Si. Subito. A cigarette? - Thank you. The boys at the Homicide Bureau are really beginning to take you seriously. What about you? Well, I was wondering if I wasn't taking you too seriously myself. You said you weren't married so .. You didn't bring me here to ask me about that, did you. No, not altogether. I wanted you to straighten me out on a few things. For instance? This, for instance. Did you ever see it before? That's the ring I found in my apartment. Where did you get it? From the pawnbroker. He notified the police the moment it turned up. You mean .. To re-coin an old bromide, it is part of the missing Bennet loot. Oh. When did you find it? This afternoon when I was leaning my apartment. I showed it to the landlady but she didn't know who it belonged to. Then I asked Karl and .. He said it was worth 8 or 10 dollars. So .. So? Well, I .. Only owed 8 dollars more on this coat I am wearing and .. You believe me, don't you? Yes I believe you. But the question is, will Dawson? He is a tough nut to crack once he gets his mind set. And he has his mind set on me? Well, he thinks you're mixed up in it somewhere. In Mrs Bennet's murder? It doesn't mean a great deal. Dawson suspects everybody until he finds the guilty party. Now. Who was in the apartment today besides you, Dawson and myself? Karl. Karl Benson. The fellow I told you about. And who else? - Mr Bennet. Oh? What was he doing there? From what I gathered .. He was checking up on his wife's movements the night she was murdered. Were they there before or after you found the ring? It was before I think. You're sure? Yes. I am sure. Good. You know, we had better be going if we want to catch that second show. But I told you how she got the ring. Please, chum. You're not going to swallow that story about finding it in the chair? Hello, Benson. Hello, Lieutenant. Don't tell me that was you who just knocked on that door there? Well, who did you think it was? - I didn't think. I just left, but quick. How are you, Dawson? Okay. Come on in. Thanks. Hiya, fellows. - How you doing, Benson? Fine. Smoke? No thanks. What were you looking for? Anything in particular? No. Just snooping. Find anything interesting? Underwriters Casualty might just as well fork over that 10 grand right now. You mean you found a lead? The dame showed me a gold signet ring. Said she found it in the overstuffed. What about it? It's part of the Bennet jewelry. I recognised it. From the description in the papers. Why didn't you notify us? - I hoped to find the rest of it first. I waited until she went to work and then came here. We know about the ring. It was reported from the pawnshop where she hocked it. Then, she is our girl alright. Take a look at this bank book. Miss Kramer's. Alright. She has a bank book. What is so strange about it? A deposit of a $1,000 made yesterday. That is what is so strange about it. Where did you get that? - In the desk there. And you tell me she couldn't make a payment of eight bucks on a coat? It doesn't add up, does it. Why, with this bankbook and the ring we can throw the works at her. Fix the room up, boys. - Where you going? To pick up the Kramer girl of course. Come on. Okay, boys. Load up. I got to fix this lock. So long. See you later, Benson. - Yeah. Why don't you come along, Benson? This is your show, you know. - Thanks Lieutenant, but .. I've got something to attend to first. Okay, but you'd better hurry up. You might miss the fun. Don't worry. I wouldn't miss this. Not for ten thousand bucks, I wouldn't. I see what you mean. So long. - So long. Come in and close the door, Benson. Turn around. So you did remember me, Doc. I wondered if you would tie me up with that Kramer kid and those references. It took me a little time but I remembered. You can turn around now. And you can put that gun away. You are not going to shoot anybody. That depends, Benson. You know what I want. You don't think I'd be a sap enough to bring the junk here do you? Then get moving and take me to it. Put that away and sit down. You and I are going to talk business. I'll make you a proposition. What makes you think I'll listen? Because you are that kind of a guy, Doc. Only you ain't really a Doc. You are a phony. And what is more. You killed Mrs Alton Bennet. Now, Doc. That would only make two murders with nothing to show for it. Alright. I'm willing to trade. First, I'd like to know how you found out about the Bennets and .. My intentions. It was kinda funny how it happened. I stole Bennet's dream from your files and started out to do the job myself. I didn't know you had the same idea. I was waiting for the Bennet dame to come home .. When I discovered that somebody else was tailing her. I didn't know it was you at first. "I couldn't help noticing that whoever it was .." "He was watching that apartment house the same as me." "He came by a couple of times." "And then when a taxi drove up he walked down the street fast." "Like he didn't want to be caught there." "He stopped by a lamppost near the corner." "I still didn't know it was you, Doc." "But I figured something was up .." "When you started hotfooting it toward that pool hall on the corner." "That was when it hit me that maybe somebody else had the same idea I had." "So I followed you." "And holy smoke. It was you, Doc." "Well it didn't take no great brain to figure out what you were up to." "So I says to myself, take it easy, Benson." "Let Doc do it." "I knew you was fooling the Bennet woman." "You wanted to get in the easy way." "When you got back, there I was ready for you." "With an armful of groceries I picked up in an all-night delicatessen. Remember?" "You fell for it and held the door open for me." "There was a couple standing in the lobby." "Remember the dame saying 'No' in 14 languages?" "You were in there an awful long time." "I didn't mind waiting because I knew what you'd have when you came out." "I hated to hit a guy like that." "But I guess it didn't hurt too much." "I looked in the languages? < briefcase and sure enough." "It was all there." Why did you kill her, Doc? Why didn't you just tie a handkerchief over your mug and stick her up? Afraid she would recognise you? - Never mind about that. Where is the jewelry? - We'll get to that later. First, we have an understanding. Do we or do we not stick together? Stick together for what? Look. The police will keep stumbling around until they dig up something. Maybe on you. Maybe on me. So? So, we need somebody to hang this on. We build a case against the Kramer kid. A good case but not too solid. I've already laid the groundwork. At the right time .. At the right time the police find the stolen jewelry in Kramer's apartment. And she takes the rap. What do we get out of that? We save our necks and collect ten grand for recovering the stolen goods. We can cash in for forty thousand. Don't kid yourself. No fence in town would handle this junk with a murder rap hanging over it. I know. I tried. Alright. So I take it out of town. What do you suppose I risked my neck for? Now hold it, Doc. We play it my way or we don't play it. Alright. What is the next step? Tonight, get me those phony references I fixed up for the Kramer gal. It will take more than forged references to pin this deal on her. I don't need them for that. I've got the Bennet jewels. Remember? I want those references for myself. Now get out. I've got important business to attend to. Tonight, Doc. About nine. Alright. I'll be here. At nine. So you worked for this Los Angeles doctor for four years? And then he dies? Yes. This is an all-night affair. I'll call my missus and have her put the dinner in the oven. From natural causes, I suppose? Well come on, Miss Kramer. What killed him? He committed suicide. - Oh, he committed suicide? Are you sure he wasn't murdered? He left a note. He left a note but he didn't leave anybody that could give you a reference. Is that it? - Dr Citron worked alone. Well, what's the matter with his wife? Why couldn't she give you a reference? She didn't like me. You and the Doc weren't two-timing her, were you? No. Don't get tough, Dawson. You'll give the department a bad name. I never get tough. You know that. Miss Kramer. You deposited a thousand dollars in your bank account yesterday. That is right. - Where did you get it? I told you. - Well, tell me again. Karl Benson gave it to me to deposit for him. Well, what do you say to that, Benson? Karl? Well, Benson? I appreciate the compliment, Kitten. But I've never had a thousand dollars at one time in my life. Karl .. this is no joking matter. I'm not joking, Kitten. You've got to think up a better one than that. Miss Kramer. I give you one more chance to change your story. Where did you get the money? I told you. He gave it to me yesterday morning. He said he was afraid to keep it, that he might spend it all at once. Karl, you know that is the truth. Look, fellahs. I've known this kid only six weeks. Now I ask you. I am dumb, sure. But do you think I'd be dopey enough to trust her with a $1,000? If I had it? Karl, you don't know what you are doing to me. These men think I am mixed up in the Bennet murder. That thousand, that money. Please tell them you gave it to me. I'm sorry, Kitten. If you'd tipped me off in time I'd have cooked up a story for you. But hitting me cold like this. What else can I do but tell the truth? Why, you .. You take over, Wilson. A tough nut, that kid. She can think up more lies than a diplomat. Did it ever occur to you she might be telling the truth? Oh, come on, chum. Please. She'll break any minute now. You going to book her? Well, when I do I'll want an ironclad case. I get it. You won't have an ironclad case until more of the stolen jewelry turns up. That's right. I wish we had done a better job on that apartment of hers. Why, she could have an elephant hidden there. What do you say if I give it the onceover? Say. That's an idea. While we keep the dame entertained here. You give her place a thorough shakedown. If you do the job right there's no telling what you might turn up. Leave it to me, Lieutenant. You got a key? - Sure. I still got a skeleton I packed when I was on the force. Well, get going. We'll wait here until we hear from you. If you find anything we'll be right over. Right. Have you signed those papers yet? - What papers? Why those. Here is a pen. Let's see. Right there. Where the cross is. - Alright. And there. And there. No, not there. That is where I sign. Right there. Alright. One more. One more right there. Thank you. What is that? A requisition for the brakes. Give them to me, Benson. Tie them up in the handkerchief and hand them to me. Don't be a fool, Doc. This junk will land you in the chair. I mean business. Hand them to me. There you are. Now. Get in that closet. Close the door. [ Telephone ] Even money? [ Telephone ] Dawson speaking. Yes? You did? Good boy, Benson. I had a feeling you'd find something. In the overstuffed chair, huh? Well, what do you know. Now look, Benson. We want the girl there when we recover the jewelry. We will let her go and then stake out her place. When she goes in we'll give her a little time and then we'll pick her up. You understand? Right. Turn the Kramer girl loose. - Okay. Berry, pick up your people and we'll meet you over there. Good evening, Miss. We'll give her five minutes. Hello honey. Karl. What are you doing here? - Waiting for you, Kitten. I want to talk to you. After what happened today I don't want anything more to do with you. Ever. Get out! Take it easy, Kitten. I want to do you a favor. I can just imagine. - I mean it. I know a lawyer who works angles. If you give me that thousand you banked for me I can get him to take your case. Oh. So that's it. You want your thousand dollars back. Well, you're not going to get it. Not now. You told Lieutenant Dawson you didn't give it to me. Remember? Better give it to me, Kitten. Uhuh. Not if my life depended on it. That is just it. Your life does depend on it. I don't see how. I still don't understand. Stop playing dumb, Kitten. You know what is in that chair just as well as I do. You? You murdered Mrs Bennet? You killed her. The sparklers will be found in your possession, Kitten. You will have a hard time explaining that. Don't you come near me. It all ties together now. You giving me the thousand dollars to bank for you. Planting the ring in my apartment. Telling me to sell it so it would be traced back to me through the police. You got it all figured out haven't you, Kitten? No. I can't understand why you are doing this to me. I've never hurt you. Somebody has to be the fall guy. Somebody always has to be the fall guy in a case like this. And anyway. The cops were already breathing down your neck. Take it easy, Kitten. I don't want to get rough with you unless I have to. You're staying right here until Dawson comes. You can't get away with this, Karl. I'll tell them things I've never said before. I'll tell them it was you who forged those references for me. How you tried to pump me for information concerning Dr Redmond's clients. That you knew all about Mrs Bennet's jewelry and her husband's dream. I'll tell them everything I know. And when I can't tell the truth anymore I'll start lying like you did. I'll tell them you told me you were going to rob Mrs Bennet. And you offered to split the money with me if I gave you some information. They'll take you too, Karl! You are right, Kitten. I got to change my plans. Instead of finding you here they'll find you lying in the alley. A suicide. You wouldn't! If they ask me about it I'll say you jumped out the window .. When you learned you would be arrested. Alright, boys. Let's go. Coop, you cover the fire-escape with Fayle. You fellows come up with me. No! Don't. No! Don't! Don't! No .. no! No. Don't do it! Help! Let go of me. Stop it you little fool. Behave yourself. Don't jump. Don't jump. What did you do that for? It's all I could to stop her. The crazy little fool wanted to kill herself. Let's take her downstairs. Check. Check. Here. Have some more water. Feel better now? - Yes, thank you. Too bad, Kitten. I am sorry. Really sorry. Take it easy, kid. Is everything here? Yeah. Everything except the diamonds that Charlie bought. Charlie? Who is Charlie? - The key-maker downstairs. We've been watching him a long time. This afternoon we picked him up. Only six weeks in town and she locates a fence. Bravo. Oh, no. Charlie didn't buy them from Miss Kramer. No? Then who? - Sergeant. Get Bayard. Mr Bayard please. Mr Bayard. Did you ever see this man before? Yes. He is the same man I saw loitering near Mrs Bennet's apartment building. The night I brought her home. - Thanks. That's all. Hey, wait a minute. What is going on here? Fayle. Bring in Mr Boyd and Miss Lake. Mr Boyd, Miss Lake. Please. Miss Lake, Mr Boyd. Did you ever see this man before? Why, yes. You showed us his picture in the line-up of policemen dropped from the force. Of course. He's the man who came in the Crayford Arms lobby with a bundle of groceries. I am positive. He dropped a package and I picked it up for him. Okay, so I was there. I was following the Bennet dame for Doc Redmond. That's a lie. - It is true. I swear it. That's right, Benson. Keep on and you will lie yourself right into the chair. You are under arrest. Under arrest? For what? For breaking the health and sanitation laws. You've got a nasty habit of sticking gum in public places. Stop clowning, Lieutenant. What is the charge? Why, you poor dumb fool. Murder. Murder? No. No. I didn't kill the Bennet dame. It was Doc Redmond who killed her. Let me go and I can prove it. The Doc is your man. The Doc? He is dead. Jeb. I've never known a congenital wiseguy yet who didn't outsmart himself. They always bear down too hard. Now you take that ring, for instance. The minute it showed up I knew it was a plant. And who else but Benson? If you stop patting yourself on the back for two seconds I'll tell you something. We're going to have new brakes tomorrow. 0h yeah? Say, that's fine. Do you think these will hold out until tomorrow? I had to give these up to get new ones. You never saw so much red tape. You mean .. now? At this very moment this car is ..? Shush, shush. What they don't know won't hurt them. Look, sweetheart. I don't want to appear to be inquisitive for anything like that. But just how do you propose to stop this buggy? We'll worry about that when the time comes. How does it feel now? I feel like I've had Novocaine. Think you could eat something? I know a great big Italian restaurant on 3rd Avenue. Uhoh. The time has come! Start worrying. (-sd)-
