Am I crazy? Am I crazy? I think you're crazy. I think you're crazy. There's only one person, one person in this room that's crazy, and that person's not me! I don't like the way you're looking at me. I don't like the way you're looking at me! You always look at people like that? Is that how you always look at people? You think I'm crazy? You think I'm crazy? I think you're crazy. Mother needs someone who is nice. Someone who is caring. Someone who is... Someone who likes to take care of other people. Well, I am a few courses shy of my nursing degree. Anybody can be a nurse. It takes a special person to look after my mother. I'm special. Do you keep a rabbit's foot on your key chain? Yup. Do you use a curling iron to curl your hair? Are you afraid of death? I do remember my pet cat dying about a year ago. Mother is dying. I've never actually seen someone die in person before. Black or white? Hm. Definitely black. Is the sky blue? Last time I checked it was. So, I got the job? Is there anything else I can do for you? I did forget my alarm clock so is it possible to get a wake up call around 9AM tomorrow morning? Of course. It's more of a wake up knock, like this. Or, depending upon how I feel, it could be more like this. So like this? Or this? There are no telephones in any of the rooms. Mother likes it better that way. Did you know what Mother opened this place with all the life insurance money gained after Father's tragic death? Father was found murdered. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for your sympathy and concern, but that was over 20 years ago. You must have been very young. Just a mere boy of eight. Didn't cry then, not about to cry now. Is there a chance that your mother could make it? Make a full recovery? Not a chance, it's just a matter of time. I'm sorry to hear... Save your words. Dying is something that you should never have to feel sorry about. Death... Death is no more than a passing dream in the night. Every now and then, a motion picture comes along that is so terrifying, so gut-wrenchingly disturbing, so violent and horrifying... I just find him kind of, weird. Time is nothin' but the beating of your fucking heart, old man. The Killing Games. He's really creepy. I'm not sure if I'm gonna like this job. Yes, Mom. Did you see my little ho, huh? Every now and then, a motion picture comes along that will leave scars permanently etched into your brain. Birdie, get some more! Get up, bitch, come on. You're always asking me if I took my medication. It's like you don't believe what I'm saying. When I tell you this guy is creeping me out, Mom, he's creeping me out. And in other news... This just in. Police have found four more dead bodies in the Waterways River. The bodies were located 200 miles outside of Junxton. Police do not want to reveal too much at this time, but they will say that it is definitely a mass murder. All of the bodies were riddled with bullet holes, however, police believe the victims were actually beaten to death before they were shot. Two of the victims has been identified as a husband and wife. Uh. The two other victims, a girl and a boy, are alleged to be the children of the married couple. A policemen, a police spokesman, I'm sorry, says that this crime may be related to a slew of other recent murders and disappearances in the Junxton Area. The identities of the family will remain private and confidential until police have notified the next of kin. In any event, I am Maximilian Smith. I'll see you later, my friends. Ugh, enough, Mom, enough. No, Mom, no. Please, stop this, Mom. Mom! Mom! I'm sure I'll be fine. I'll see how I feel tomorrow after a good rest, and I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. It's a wonderful view, isn't it? All I can see is darkness out there. That's what makes it so wonderful. It's a beautiful night, isn't it? It's one of those nights when you can hear the wind howl. But it's more than just the wind howling. If one listens very closely, they can hear the slight breathing of a wolf. Can you hear the wolf, Loni? No. I can't. If you happen to hear screaming in the night or unfamiliar sounds of despair and woe, there's no need to feel alarm or even to call the police. I like to watch horror movies, especially at night. It's a beautiful night, isn't it? You want me to call an ambulance? She should be okay. Were you talking to Arthur? No, I haven't seen him all day. I think he was looking for you earlier. Oh, I've been out, I just got back a few minutes ago. You know, I hate to say this, but it looks like she's about ready to die. I am not ready to die just yet! If, um, if you see Arthur tell him that I'm gonna be in my room. How is she doing? Not so well, but she was able to talk a little today. Arthur. Her biggest worry is, she hopes that you can keep the tradition alive. She is in pain. Almost... 20 years... this place has been running. I... Don't worry, I will not let you down. After your father died, I... - I. - Save your breath, Mother. Goddess guide me. Two. Three. Four. Nine. 10. 11. 12. 13. "And it was a world where nothing bad "ever happened to anybody. "There was never any negativity, "and everyone lived forever and ever happily together "for the rest of eternity." Would you like to hear another one? Yes. "Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Matt "and a little girl named Tara. "Matt had a big crush on Tara. "He thought she was the prettiest girl "that he had ever seen in his entire life." That is so wonderful. "When school was out for the summer vacation, "Matt thought about Tara the entire time. "He couldn't wait until school started again "to see if Tara was going to be in his grade three class. "They hadn't talked since grade one "when Tara stabbed him in the shoulder with a pencil. "But all Matt thought about was Tara, Tara, Tara." See you in hell, bitch. Get away from him, bitch. This isn't over. You're right, it's only begun. Fuck you, bitch. Not a pleasant start to the summer vacation, two adults and six high school teenagers were found murdered at a summer cottage north of Watertown this morning. Also recovered was the body of missing teen Tiffany Means whose disappearance eight months ago was said to have been a runaway. Her deformed body was found at the bottom of the lake near the cottage. Police have failed to identify a connection between all the deaths, however, both the male and female teen have survived the horrible ordeal. They were found gashed and bruised at the scene of the crime and will be questioned after their release from the hospital. The two slain adults were renowned police superintendent Paul Schrider and his wife Kimberly. The identities of the other teens have not yet been released. Please stay tuned for further information regarding this troubling incident. My friends are dead and I found out my sister was murdered by them. I don't know what's real and what's not anymore. You going out tonight? No. Not tonight. Is that because you had too much fun last night? I'm sorry, I hope I didn't wake anybody up when I came in last night. Well, you did, you woke up Mother and myself. Who were those two men that spent last night in your room? Kept me up most of the night. Some guy named Jake and his buddy Johnson. I don't know. I met them when I was hitchhiking. Went out to the Roadhouse Pub. Didn't really know 'em very well. You sure got to know them well last night. Yeah, sometimes I do stupid things when I get drunk. You know that you have violated one of Mother's most sacred rules. You agreed when you checked in that you would sign in any extra guests. We need to know who is coming in and out at all times, Jocelyn. That is part of the agreement that you signed. You need to check in any extra guests. I am so sorry, I didn't read all the fine print. I will pay you next time and I promise that I will abide by all the rules. It's not that simple. You owe us more money for the extra guests last night. Okay, fine. Can I take care of it in the morning? I'd like to take a bath, maybe get a little rest. Get some sleep. Tomorrow morning is fine. We can take care of it in the morning. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. So were you able to talk to Arthur? Yeah, we just had a talk. - Awesome. - Yeah. You know, I was thinking, you are such a nice person. - Oh, thank you. - No, I really mean that. And you do so many nice things for so many people. You're always taking care of them, and I thought that somebody should take care of you for a change. What do you mean? Somebody should make you feel good. Make you smile. Make ya happy. Make you feel really, really good. Oh! No, I'm okay! I must say, you guys don't mess around. They're paying me to do what I do, and I'm really good at it. I'll probably have this place sold within a week. Would you like to come and join me for a tea? Actually, coffee's more my poison. I have a few more documents for you to sign. It's just all the standard stuff. And here. And here. I've been going back and forth in my mind with this. Back and forth with what? Whether I should sell this place or not. Mother wants me to carry on the tradition. Arthur, we discussed this before. You're just having last minute jitters about everything. It happens all the time. You're making the right decision by selling this place. Don't you think we could rip these papers up and nobody would be the wiser? What do you think, I'm crazy? You just signed on the dotted line, buddy. Once you sign, that's it. I have a lot of money riding on this baby. Am I dreaming, or did you just say? I didn't say anything. I guess we could rip these papers up and nobody would be any wiser. But is this something that you really want, after all our discussions and all of the hard work that we have both put into this? You just sign the papers, big boy, and that's it! You fuck me on this deal, I'll come back and I'll blow this place the fuck up, do you hear me? Your mother's in there on her death bed. You get rid of the guilt, Arthur. You must get rid of the fucking guilt! Do you really want me to rip these papers up, Arthur, or would you like me to sell this place to the highest bidder, just like we discussed? You're right, what was I thinking? Exactly, what were you thinking? So we have a deal? Yes, we have a deal. Perfect. Don't worry, I will get you the best price that I possibly can. Remember, my commission is also riding on this deal. It could be your street, your house, your life! You wouldn't wanna make the front pages lookin' like that, would you? What front pages, what are you talking about?

I think there may be a room but you'll have to wait here for the manager. The sign out front says there's a vacancy. Can I wait inside? - Yeah, sure, come on in. - Oh, thanks. I know what he was doing to you, and I let it go. Look the other way. Pretending not to believe that your own uncle could do such vile things to you. Uncle?

Police are stating that they're getting closer to solving the recent murders in the area. They now believe that the killer is acting alone and that he is a white male between the ages of 25 and 35. So remember, if you see any suspicious activity do not hesitate to call your local police detachment to report anything unusual. And now today, in our Weird Facts segment. A record has been broken today for the world's heaviest stillbirth baby. It has been reported that a baby girl weighing in at an astonishing weight of 27 pounds and two ounces in the port city of Wonsan in the Kamwon Province in the People's Republic of North Korea. Doctors say that upon exiting the womb, the baby was dead on arrival. They also go on to say that if they could have saved the baby, well, they certainly would have. The robbery, it went wrong. Listen. All of these places have safes. I'll fucking rob 'em, kill every last one. Nobody will know fuck all, Hank. I'll be long gone outta this place by the time they find the dead bodies. I just gotta take care of my last fix and uh. I, uh. Don't care what you do, Tracey. None of my business. You got another few hours to get me my money or you're a dead woman. They won't know what him 'em, Hank. I'll get you the money, I promise. I gotta go. I'm gonna hang up now, okay? And if you don't get the money to me... I gotta go, I gotta take the last fix. She's quite nice, don't you think so, boys? Well, what are we supposed do with her now? I've got a wife at home. I'm afraid she's become our uninvited guest. I must say, I've had worst guests at better parties. All right, Corby, all right. Let's not forget where we are. Even though we're lost in the woods, let's try to remain civilized. You don't even smile. You don't. Just a, just a minute! I said just one minute. Hey, what? Yup. Exactly what I thought, it's a flat tire. What else could go wrong tonight? Yeah, first we run outta gas and now this. And now I've gotta go change a flat tire. There's no tire wrench! How am I supposed to change a tire with no tire wrench? Well, it's gotta be here somewhere. No, we're shit outta luck. How could you, how could you not have a tire wrench? Mack, you need to calm down. You know I don't like it when you get like this. It's always something, isn't it, Janet? Mack, stop, stop this please. It just makes me sick to my stomach. How am I supposed to marry somebody that always makes dumb mistakes like this? Mack. It's just like the time you left the money sitting out on the table. Who does that? $4000, you leave it sitting out so a guy breaks in. Of course he's gonna take whatever he wants. I love you, stop! Yeah, you love me, that's what they all say. And then they lie and they cheat and they steal from me. I have never cheated on you and I never will. I would give my life for you and you know that. Mack, come on. Come on, you know that. Janet. I walked and walked for miles, and I couldn't find a cell signal anywhere. Sounds like we're in the middle of nowhere. We are. But at least there's a sign for Bed and Breakfast up ahead. How close, honey? I don't think I'm in any shape to be doing all that walking this time of night. Let's just wait until morning. See if maybe we can wave a car down or something. The wedding's tomorrow, honey, okay? We're racing against time, all right? We need to call roadside assistance. I just remembered where the wrench was to change to wheel. Where? At my Uncle Eddie's. Wait, Uncle Eddie's? The Uncle Eddie that lives 900 miles away? Look, are you gonna come with me to make this call or do you want me to just lock the doors and let you sleep? Okay. Arthur. Arthur. Relax, Pearl, relax. It's okay. Water. Water. No, holy water. Holy wa... She wants the holy water. She wants you to bless her with it. No. Art. She wants you to bless her with the water. I don't know how much more of this I can bear. She needs to die! Just say the word, Loni, just say the word! Put that down, Arthur! When your mother is ready to die, she will die. Why are you dying? Why are you doing this to me? Why, Mother? Looking for a room? No, my girlfriend and I broke down up the road, and I was wondering if I could use your phone to call roadside assistance. How far up the road? Just a few miles. We just need service to come out, we don't have a wrench. I got all kinds of wrenches in the garage. What's the make and model of your vehicle? Wait, what are we doing here? The guy came out to help us. The least we can do is go inside. He said we can wash up. Come on. Are you sure you don't wanna spend the night? We would but. We really need to get going after we get cleaned up. We do appreciate the offer and maybe we'll stop in on our way back through and stay here for a night. Hey, any bed and breakfast that offers a free shower is my kinda bed and breakfast. We'll definitely stay here on our way back through. Excuse me a moment. Uh, Arthur? The Lord of Darkness stands beside me, amongst us. I hereby declare this a mercy killing. Lord have mercy! I appreciate all of your help, Loni, but now it is time to die.
