INN OF FLOATING WEEDS Screenplay: Iwao Yamazaki Producer: Ryoji Motegi Cinematographer: Toshitaro Nakao Art Director: Teruyoshi Satani Assistant Director: Kazunari Takeda Editor: Akira Suzuki Song: "Inn of Floating Weeds" Performed by Hachiro Kasuga CLUB HARBOR LIGHT FIGHT AT UNFINISHED SEAWALL Mr. Shida, Marubishi Group Section Head, Stabbed to Death Kozue! Was Shunji really killed? I know how you feel. How can you? Do you believe he's dead? He must be! What did you say? If he wasn't killed in the fight, he may have drowned. -Shunji! -Kozue! Just try to forget all about it. How nostalgic! This is a song we all used to sing together. I still remember. I know it's painful. Still... ...in time we can forget such things. It's best if you just forget the bitter things. What are you talking about? It's not just whether I should or shouldn't forget. How could I ever forget Shunji? What will become of me now? No, I didn't mean... Stupid! Kozue! Kozue! Let's lighten the mood up a little bit! FEATURING Haruo: Hachiro Kasuga Yuri:Ikuko Kimuro Shunji: Hideaki Nitani Murayama: Toru Abe Toné: Jun Miyazaki Taki: Shoichi Ozawa Mio/Kozue: Hisano Yamaoka Directed by Seitaro Suzuki FIVE YEARS LATER Oh, you must be on shore leave! Want to have some fun? Is Kozue still here? Oh, you want Kozue! Kozue! Yes, yes! Sit down! -Drink up! -Kozue! What is it? Kozue! Remember me? -What? -Tsujita! Don't you remember? Hey, handsome! Come with me! I can hear the steam whistle... from the tavern at the harbor... ...drifting, drifting in and out... of the Inn of Floating Weeds. It seems it's both our fates. So we drink until the end of the night. So you had to run away to Hong Kong... ...and got a job for a shipping company ...and five years later, you came back for a woman. How romantic! ...looking at your face from the side... ...brings back a memory... ...of a woman I once cast aside. But what can I do about it after such a long time has passed? You're the one... ...who kept calling me "Kozue" earlier. Who the hell are you, anyway? What are you doing? I put myself at great risk to come back to see you. Who are you? Shunji. You're... Shunji? I know it's unthinkable. Shunji! Madame! What will you have? White horse. You like it straight? You used to drink sweet cocktails. Shunji... ...my name is Mio. I'm Mio, the Madame here. I'm not Kozue. I'm not the woman you're looking for. How unfortunate. Sir! Don't forget your hat! HANADA CONSTRUCTION MARUBISHI CONSTRUCTION I'd like to ask something. -Wasn't this a Hanada Group project? -Yes. Before I came here, Marubishi had a big fight with them. They crushed them. -Crushed them? -Yes. Since then, Marubishi took over. They're a construction company that's been expanding a lot recently. Where's their office? Get in, quickly. Quickly! Tell the boss I'll be back. Idiot! How could Shunji be alive? It's true! Where'd you see him? In front of the office parking lot. How'd you recognize him? We were sailors together. I don't know how he survived, but it's definitely him. I saw him myself. Boss... ...if it really is Shunji... ...we can't let him live. He's the one who killed Shida. Taki! Double check it's him. Taki. Wait a sec. Taki was too close to him. Leave this one to me. That 5-year-old incident is settled. If there's noise, we can't afford to let the name Marubishi be involved. Yoshimura can recognize him... ...so if we're sure it's Shunji, make it look like an accident. I understand, but... if he's back, he wants to start trouble. He's very irritating, isn't he? Shunji! You're... Do I resemble my sister so closely? I'm Kozue's younger sister. Sister? -I'm her sister, Mio. -Mio? I see. I'd like to talk to Kozue. Since she's your sister... ...do you know how she is? Where is she? Where's your sister? I came back for her. Do you know? Where she is now? Did something happen? Why are you silent? Why are you silent? Mio! Shunji! She thought we'd marry if you returned. That's right. When I came to Yokohama, you were already missing. By then, she'd stopped looking for you. Then she vanished. She didn't tell you where? She just gave me your engagement ring. It's been three years since she disappeared. For all I know, she's dead. Stupid! Don't say that! She's not dead. Kozue isn't dead! It's all your fault! Why did you kill someone? You have it wrong. That's not what happened! It wasn't me who killed him. He hit my head with a beer bottle and I fell. Who would believe that? Shunji! You're a criminal! That was the most difficult part for her It was too hard, and it killed her! It's too late! You can't bring her back! You ruined her life! Mio. Why are you so sure she's dead? -Let's find her together. -The police will arrest you. The police? We don't need to talk to them. We'll find her on our own. How about it? -We can pool what we know... -It's too late! It's all too late. Hey, Shunji! Let us borrow him a minute. Toné, stop it! The boss gave me permission. You'd better not get in our way. Stop this! -Tell your boss I told you to! -Mio! Are you connected to Marubishi? Toné! I see. Shunji! We've finally found you. I didn't kill Shida. -Who was it? -I dunno. -You fought with him. -Yes. A man with a knife appeared. Don't talk outta this! Big brother! Let's throw him in! When the flowers come out in my hometown when they came out It bounced with joy, the silhouette Now I'm at a fork in a hill road Let's forget it! I cry and stumble Somehow, I've even forgotten her whistle I forgot it all When I called the girl from far away Haruo Shima It allowed me, the silhouette When I covered in mud From the bottom of my heart Wrapping up a red kimono I miss her terribly How I miss her Are you better? Of course it was you. Thanks. Are you going out now? We'll be waiting! Looks tasty, doesn't it? Just relax. I've stirred up some trouble with Marubishi. I hope I haven't got you mixed up. It's all right. Don't worry about such things. You're very generous. What's your name? Me? Yuri. Your brother? Haruo. I call him "Harukko." Was he ever a longshoreman? Yes. Really? Why? You're sneaky. You haven't even told me your name. I'm Shunji. Shunji? What a nice name! Thanks. Where'd Haruo go? I'm not sure. I see. When he gets back, thank him. -You seem prone to danger. -I'll be fine. How obstinate! He'll be back soon. Shunji, won't you rest until he's back? Well? -I have an appointment. -You're going back? -Unfortunately. -I see. Your jacket. Don't go getting into fights like that again. Look after this body. Don't let it get broken. Promise? Not to fight? I promise. Whatever you say. I'm so happy! And come visit us. Here. Take it. I couldn't. Take it for now. For taking care of me. You're so coy. What is it? Why don't you open it when I get back? Be careful! Hey! Oh, it's you. I'm lucky you found me. How are your wounds? Nothing too bad. That's lucky. You'd better stay away from the Madame. I mistook her for someone. I see. She's with the boss of Marubishi Construction. I was wondering about that. Can I get a ride? Captain, a customer! -You're on the Saranga Maru? -How'd you know? Yokohama's a small place. Where's the customer? Just make sure you're careful. Where's Mr. Green? He left? He asked me to give you this. I don't get it. How about a glass? Hey, Toné. My name is Kang Ho-chun. My name is Murayama. Should we get straight to our transaction? There's someone here I can't stand. Why'd you shut off the light? He hit the wrong switch. I didn't think it was so expensive. It isn't the price. Don't accept gifts so easily. Why would I refuse it when he was being so polite? I'm in charge, and I forbid it. But why? He seemed very grateful to you. Just return it to him. We don't want to get mixed up with him. Why do you assume Shunji's bad? What do we do if he is? Then why did you help him? -If you were hesitant about him, why... -Yuri! I hate it! I hate your thinking! I won't talk to you about this any more. When the light flickers and shakes as it eventually will in this town I'll still have strength to sing. Nothing can force me to stop because I have a dream. In my memory of the night we parted secretly, in this town that doesn't change Today came like any other day If you call for me again, my passion will reignite because I have a dream, I will come Best to do it quickly. I'm counting on you. Mio. Don't get too cozy with Shunji. Tone. Don't screw up. By now, he knows we're after him. Got it? I understand. Mio! Step outside, will you? Yoshimura! Get out! Go home, right away! I have something to ask you! You're in danger! Since when are you Murayama's woman? Go back! What are you hiding about Kozue? Shut up! Mio! Are you interfering with my business? What's that face mean? Be careful! I'm an expert gymnast! You think I'm lying? I'll do a handstand! Ready? I'll do it! I understand, Yuri! You don't have to prove it. You didn't want this? Too much of a tomboy? The thing is... my brother said I had to return it. -Your brother? Le matin ennui You know? Le... what was it? Le matin ennui. It means he's cranky in the morning. So he told me I had to give it back. He was very angry! Your brother knows French? No, but he always complains in the morning. That's what you mean. Sorry. Shunji, how long will you stay in Yokohama? Let me guess. 'Til you find your long lost sweetheart. I'm right, aren't I? Well, Shunji? Who'd you hear it from? Yuri! No one. Your brother? I just guessed it. Was I right? I was right, wasn't I? The thing is, she died. Yuri! You'll look strange with only one shoe. Let's go buy new ones. Haruo won't scold you this time. How strange! What's my old sweetheart got to do with you? Let's go! Let's go. What's wrong? You're hopeless! What's wrong? You think Haruo will scold you for being with me? It's okay. I don't care if he does. Please, Shunji. The Saganmaru is up to something with Marubishi. Promise not to get involved? My brother says that your ship is bad. Yuri! Yuri! Let me go! Let me go! Let go! Yuri! You only want me because your sweetheart is gone! It's so vexing! I'm so vexed! I'm sorry, Yuri. You're so kind to me. Unlike anyone I've ever met. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? Wait. -Don't walk barefoot. -It's okay. It's all right. Wear them Thank you. Welcome. -What'll it be? -Red Label. Bro! Come out here! -Who is it? -Taki. Taki? Have you forgotten me? Bro. You don't look happy to see me. Never mind. -Let's drink up! -Thank you. I'm glad you're well. You seem nervous. I can't stay. I'm very sorry. No need to apologize. It seems it can't be helped. By the way, I want to ask you something Bro! Hurry up! It's all right. We can talk later. I'm coming! I'm at May Flower Hotel. See you there. -It's better not to talk here. -I see. It's the first floor. First door on the left. Oh, Taki? You beat me! Let's take it easy. It's been five years. Let's celebrate tonight! Come over here. Who are you? Mio! -Shunji, I... -Forget it. Let's have a drink first. You can relax. It's White Horse. Should I make a highball? I was moved to tears I cried without stopping I parted with that girl Lamentably Even the trees on the mountain cried While a solitary cedar tree Watched over like a stone Bodhisattva In the outskirts of the village Just how my sister liked it. White Horse. We loved to drink it. It was hard to get your hands on then. Whenever we managed to find it somewhere, it would lift our spirits. We drank a lot together. One time... ...after a night of drinking wine, it was a real mess... We were laughing like children but the hangover was killer. But what became of her? Shunji! I couldn't tell you in the bar... I... There's something I've hidden from you. About Kozue? I'm sorry. It was just after you disappeared... You were my sister's sweetheart. She... After you vanished... Murayama went after her. Shunji! You don't wanna tell anyone about this. Got it? Go help move her! Taki told me about it. I didn't know what to do! Shunji! -Where will you go? -Where do you think? Maruyama! It's dangerous! From far, far away... ...a memory returns... ...of the distant sky... ...when I finally arrive in Tokyo. I'm too late, she tells me. Like an apple... I'll have revenge against Murayama. You can't! I belong to him. Fool! After he killed your sister? Shunji! I'm closer to Murayama than you are. Let me go to him. I want to avenge her! That was why I got close to him! I'm so angry when I think about Murayama and my sister. But the thing is, Shunji... -He's too powerful now! -I don't care what he does to me. All I know is, I'll to anything to avenge her! Think it over. I called out, over and over... I called out on a moonlit night... ...she didn't return to me... ...I waited again on my way home... How long has it been? It must be twenty years or more. Much too long. Shunji! Please! -Shunji! Think this through! -Mio! I've waited 5 years. -I snuck back -Let's go to the police! The police? I'm a fugitive! And you? How'd you explain being with your sister's killer? I'm trying to protect you! You know about my promise. You ought to understand. -It won't be Murayama alone. -I'm ready for whoever gets in the way. Whatever happens, I'm ready. But Shunji! Don't say anything more! It's settled. Shunji! Wait! Taki? Murayama's doing, again. It's too bad running into you here. With this unfortunate business. By the way... I want you to make sure Shunji comes to the bar tonight. Got it? I didn't tell you to kill Taki. Just follow my orders from now on. Boss. He blabbed about Kozue after I warned him. -So what? -I had to kill him. He was there that night and saw everything. Who else might he tell? At this point, that doesn't matter. Shunji is what matters. That jerk may have talked, but we don't need heat from the cops right now. You might've exposed us. Toné. He's going to come to us tonight. Sit down here. I'll be waiting with Mio. Yoshimura. You know the plan? Who are you calling? The police? Don't play innocent! That Shunji bastard got to you, didn't he? It's you! You're under arrest for smuggling. Don't try to resist! We're taking you in! Bastard! You're Shida's killer! You... I rub out whoever's in the way. With Shida around, I couldn't rise in the ranks. Run 'em down! Big brother! You got a problem? Now's our chance! Bastard! What're you doing? Stop that! It's dangerous! Mio! Shunji! Mio! Mio! Murayama? Where's Murayama? Murayama... Harbor Light... Harbor Light? Shunji! They got him. Murayama My sister's ring... ...come take it. You're... I have to arrest you for smuggling. But for my sister, I'll use this instead. I've been probing into Marubishi's smuggling. So you... I know Saranga Maru is involved. I've arrested your captain. Won't you come quietly? Just for now. You'll manage. Brother. Why'd Shunji leave without saying goodbye? He must have been rushed. Will he come back? His ship comes back in a month. A month? It has to go to India and back. I see. That's so long. Yuri. When Shunji gets back, let's let him stay with us. This is yours. Go on, take it. It's all right. Shunji will be back. Even though I remember it... ...my pathetic love is just tears in the wind. What a fool I am. Like the mountains in the sunset... ...if you look into the sun... My heart inflames with passion. A deep, deep red. The Inn of Floating Weeds THE END
