The Vengeance of the Mummy Thousands of years ago, the Egyptian people spread their hegemony of power and culture across the known world During the 18th dynasty, wearing upon his brow the white and red tiaras of upper and lower Egypt, reigned the pharaoh Amenhotep. These are bad times for the Egyptian nation, as the pharaoh is a brutal being, despotic and cruel, under whose cruel reign the country moans and sighs The Egyptian Emperor is a tyrant whose horrendous crimes tinge the warm sands of the country blood red Amenhotep murders lovely young women to satisfy his repugnant and in confessable appetites No one, no matter how noble and powerful they may be, is safe from dying in the most cruel manner to satisfy the mad Pharaoh's whims The Pharaoh's reign is a hallucinatory nightmare of blood and horror Joining him in his outrages is Amarna, the most beautiful of his concubines, as cruel and bloodthirsty as Amenhotep himself Nevertheless, the pharaoh has a powerful enemy, one that is astute and tenacious and that has sworn to punish him He is the only one able to confront the sinister tyrant We speak of Am-sha, high priest of Amon-Ra We've been destroyed lord, our men lie forevermore on the battleﬁeld Defeated? My armies have been defeated in Ramose, overcome by the Nubians That damned Semut, who I should never have named general, has led us to defeat I'll order him executed, him and all his ofﬁcers! GO, dog! Living God, calm your just rage Tomorrow we shall sacriﬁce ten virgins and the next battle shall be propitious Deje, bring me a drink They've poisoned me My body is losing strength, only my mind remains clear Amenhotep, at last your reckoning has come A punishment that won't be as terrible as your crimes deserve, because your evil, is inﬁnite You will wander in the world of shadows eternally, with neither rest or sustenance, and you shall forever be denied entry into the world of the dead Anubis shall not weigh your soul on his scales, and it shall never join the divinity of Isis and Osiris Now the noble Raotep shall take your place and peace and prosperity shall return to our country Damned Am-sha, I always knew you hated me, but I am powerful and the forces of evil shall help me One clay I will be free and I shall unleash my hatred upon the world I will recover my dear Amarna and we shall embrace in the shadows My descendants shall hear my call Dig It's wonderful, and it's intact Nathan, intact It seems that way, there are no signs of it having been desecrated We've been lucky Did you notice? This is something unusual Yes, there are no offerings or food, only the sarcophagus - However, this is a pharaoh - There's no doubt, these are the hallmarks of royalty Imagine, an unviolated tomb, and of a pharaoh of the XVIII dynasty The foundation never dreamed of owning such a piece This will be a global event, and we are the discoverers Surely that papyrus holds the explanation to this mystery We'll study it in London, it will be exciting work Sir Douglas will collaborate with us, it will be the greatest accomplishment of his life Yes, and perhaps it will let him forget his disgrace a bit I am very proud of you, my lessons have borne fruit Yes, this is one of the greatest archaeological discoveries Here are the pictures I am eager to decipher this papyrus... with your help, naturally It's astounding, incredible He's very happy I've never seen father so excited since the accident I'm very happy too Helen, I know you'll ﬁnd it easier now to free yourself of that feeling of guilt I can never forget what happened, he will always be tied to that wheelchair The papyrus is related to the tablet of Bubastis! The name Amenhotep appears on both And they doubted his existence, but there, in that sarcophagus, Amenhotep has slept for thousands of years, the Cursed Pharaoh I have invited you to dinner tonight because I have a surprise for you No no, you don't have to accompany me, I'm feeling quite well today Sit down, I need to go ﬁnd something It's alright Meland Here it is I've ﬁnished the translation of the papyrus Read it Nathan Amenhotep, that despicable monster, brought the greatest disasters to Egypt He made a pact with the 42 spirits of evil and used them for his unspeakable purposes He drank the blood of virgins, ate human ﬂesh at diabolical banquets in honor of the renegade spirits He killed and destroyed without pause at his whim Amon-Ra is just and powerful, he gave us the strength to face the tyrant and today during the seventh moon the villains time of punishment has come We will bury him alive so that his black spirit roams without peace or tranquility, tied to a putrefying body His grave will be devoid of all that the soul needs to live forever in the land of the dead Amarna, his malignant lover, has also been punished, and her spirit won't ﬁnd peace either because no one will mummify her ungodly body In the seventh moon and during the XVIII dynasty, Am-Sha, high priest of Amon-Ra You'll have to forgive me, my head hurts badly - Goodnight - Goodnight Sometimes I don't understand her, evidently her mother's blood has overruled her English education and my own blood - She must have been an exceptional woman - Yes There were some who told me it was madness to marry with an Egyptian woman, some reproached me In those days was not well looked upon to marry a woman from the colonies I don't know, perhaps they were right, but no, I never regretted it I spent the best years of my life at her side Unfortunately... it all ended too soon Please sir, touching any part of the exhibition is forbidden Forgive me, but it's so beautiful that I couldn't contain myself Besides, the hall isn't open to the public I'm sorry. May I speak with Professor Stark? I do not know if he's arrived Where can I ﬁnd him? - I came from Cairo to talk to him - I'll ask It's quite possible that he's in the Society's founder Sir Douglas' quarters Lately they've been busy studying the pieces that were brought from Egypt Go into the living room and wait a moment please - Professor Assad Bey - Sir - It's a pleasure - Professor Stark, delighted to meet you I came from Cairo when I heard of your discovery We will begin investigations on the process of mummiﬁcation within a month Why wait a month? The news has aroused great interest among scientists from various countries and they've asked to attend I've just seen a small table from the XVIII dynasty that seemed very interesting It's ironic that we, the native Egyptologists, have to travel around the world to study our own civilization I have the translation of that tablet and it's a message left by Amenhotep himself Come in to the living room, may I offer you a cup of tea? Thank you I decided a long ago to live in the museum to be closer to my collection This is the translation of the message Amenhotep left It seems that the pharaoh had a presentiment of his end and wanted to ensure his vengeance It goes like this: I, Amenhotep, pharaoh of the two Egypts, lord of the red crown, lord of the white crown, trust in who carries my blood and is elected by the 42 spirits to complete the rite and and so bring me out of my state of helplessness For this, he must sacriﬁce three maidens and mix their blood with sap from the plant of life Then, when the conﬂuence of the stars is propitious, he will recite the kabbalah of Sothis and I will return to unite with him Later I will cause Amarna spirit incarnate again and so obtain together the eternal power of the 42 spirits. I, Amenhotep, pharaoh of Egypt Memphis, XVIII dynasty It's curious how all the pieces ﬁt if it weren't for the fact that I don't believe in curses or witchcraft I would think that the power of the pharaoh was real Hurry, we're going to be late again So what? I'm sick of Ms. Barton and her stupid rules You know what I say? We should change residences or rent a small house between the three of us Anne, Mary! Come here please! I've hurt myself, I can't walk! Look Oh almighty Horus, I invoke you to offer in sacriﬁce the three maidens that your worship demands Show your benevolence, and pull from his torpor divine my divine ancestor Amenhotep, lord of the headdress, possessor of the two crowns, pharaoh of Egypt! Horus, favourite of Osiris, you who does not fear the power of Amon-Ra, you who torment the souls of the dead that will never reach the land of their ancestors, hear out prayers so that the divine Amenhotep may be freed Your name please? Ms. Barton, Ms. Gloria Barton - Age? - 35 years - Excuse me? - Well, 42 Profession? Director of the Victory House residence for ladies Well Ms. Barton, now be calm, and tell me what happened It's horrible, horrible Mr. Commissioner, the three have disappeared, and what am I to tell their families? Calm down Ms. Barton, Tell me how old these three young girls are Annie and Peggy are 22, Mary's 19 At that age there are many reasons for a lady to be missing from home for a few days Those are decent girls, I don't accept any other kind of people in my residence, - my house is a very honorable one! - Of course Don't fear, we will do our utmost to ﬁnd those young ladies, and if they return, please let us know immediately Carmichael, please be so kind as to see Ms. Barton out Good day No thank you, I don't want anymore Alright, I'll be going - Goodbye - Goodnight - Well, I'm off to do my rounds - Goodbye Close the door, it'll get cold in here Nathan Nathan, dear, you work too much I have to ﬁnish the report Alright, but promise me that when you ﬁnish we'll take a vacation Yes? Who is this? What? He disappeared? Dead? When did it happen? It seems that it happened at midnight He was a good man It's maddening On examing the cadaver they discovered that he was covered in dust that's only found in a mummy's wrappings On top of that the ﬁngerprints don't correspond to any living beings The killers strength must be superhuman, he almost crushed his skull Everything ﬁts with the legend of Amenhotep, everything That's absurd, incredible, a mummy can't come back to life! I wouldn't go that far In our ancient civilization there are untold mysteries, it could be this is conﬁrmation of the curse of the tombs Do you remember the tragic death of Lord Bracks and his entire expedition? They violated the tombs of Thomoses Ill and Ramses ll That was a string of ﬂukes, just unlucky coincidences Yes, it could be Please Dorothy, put it on the table Assad Bey, you have been chosen by the 42 spirits to free me from my millennial immobility I will give you power, riches and eternal life but ﬁrst you must help me ﬁnd a woman whose body will be occupied by Amarna's tortured spirit For thousands of years she has suffered, wandering in the shadows Now she will come to my side to punish those who dared to violate the secrets of Egypt and you shall as powerful as you may desire I've gathered all the information I could on the legend of Amenhotep and there are many curious things For Amenhotep to escape from the immobility imposed on him by Am-sha the kabbalah of Sothis must be recited and his sarcophagus must be doused in a mixture of blood of three maidens sacriﬁced on three consecutive nights This will cause him to rise from his tomb To obtain his freedom for good another seven women must die in a similar fashion and Amenhotep will be free forever I see you're very worried about this business, but it's a police matter Three girls have disappeared and I fear that another seven will too If Assad Bey heard you he'd say the pharaoh's curse was coming true Assad Bey is an enigmatic person about whom we know nearly nothing about Perhaps it'd be a good idea to learn something about him We've arrived I'm so happy George - Do you like the house? - It will be a marvelous home - Would you like to eat something? - No Wait a moment before coming in It's very humid tonight This cold seeps into my bones When one gets old... I'm going to take the clothes to Mrs. Morrison - I won't be long - So long daughter Police! Police! It's horrible! Halt! Don't worry maam, we'll ﬁnd her Don't worry Ofﬁcer Brown, an envelope It was a mistake, a lamentable mistake, our authorities should never have allowed that valuable piece of our culture to leave Egypt That's absurd, senseless The theft of the mummy, those girls who disappeared, the legend of that cursed Pharaoh It's clear that a criminal mind wants us to believe that Amenhotep has come back to life That's childish, it must be the work of a madman Everyone knows a mummy can't come back to life An old legend says that lotus ﬂowers can grant happiness and wisdom It's an ancient tradition of our people My mother cultivated them, they're quite lovely Helen, we haven't known each other long but we share the same blood and that allows me to understand you much better I know something very bitter tortures you Tell me about it Helen I will be able to understand My father is paralyzed and it's my fault I didn't want him to go to that party on that infernal night He insisted on accompanying me and on our way home, the horses slipped and he became an invalid Helen, it wasn't your fault, everything is written You mustn't torture yourself, believe me Sanofed! Let's go It's late It's getting late, we have to leave It's not that late My parent's will scold me It's always the same thing, they have to accept that times change, we're in the 20th century - Tell me goodbye before you leave - Goodbye You know what I mean At last I will have my absolute freedom Soon my beloved Amarna will be at my side again I can't help it, I have a feeling that Assad Bey is behind all this Honestly Nathan, I don't believe it Assad seems to me to be a normal sort, and I don't believe him capable of wrongdoing no matter how small I agree that he's strange, introverted, mysterious, but consider that his mindset is different, he's of another race But his upbringing is completely European Helen has also been educated in Europe, half of her blood is English, however within her exists an undoubtable atavism Agreed, but it's something more than that! There's something perverse about Assad Bey, disquieting I think what's happened has made you nervous I'm sure this is the work of a madman, but not him When he arrived he showed great interest in everything concerning the pharaoh, despite his being an Egyptologist it seemed unbalanced Then, after the theft of the mummy, his visits slowly lessened He disappeared and we haven't had word of him for over two weeks It's very strange He's not going to visit us everyday, and besides, he could have left London Why don't you call him and dispel your doubts? You'll see there's a reasonable explanation Please put me through to the Metropolitan Hotel Miss Great Metropolitan Hotel I'd like to speak to Professor Assad Bey I'm sorry sir but Professor Bey is no longer here ls he still lodged there? He still has his room reserved, but I believe he's rented a home in the outskirts - close to the old mill - Thank you Assad lives in a house on the outskirts now, but he still has a room at the hotel Let's pay him a visit, it could be interesting May I accompany you? I'd like to see Sanofed again No Assad, the spirit of Amarna could never reside in that body, nor in this one! Assad, a threat approaches Come in please - What a pleasant surprise - And Assad? He'll be here in a moment, your visit will please him Your silence worried us I called your hotel and they gave us this address We planned to visit you one of these days - Why the move? - Assad wanted to isolate himself, he wants to write a book Welcome, you bring me great joy Sanofed, have you offered our guests some coffee? Or perhaps you'd prefer tea, that's more British I'd like some tea And you Helen? No, I don't want anything, thank you What news do you bring? Did the pharaoh turn up? I reserved my room at the hotel because I plan to visit London once in a while but I needed tranquility to be able to write What are you writing about? It's a study on the Middle Kingdom, I'll dedicate a chapter to your discovery Please Sanofed, bring me all the material I've written If you need more information you know I'm at your service I might need you though you've already given me so much I'm very grateful for all the information you've provided It's a shame we didn't get to study the mummy, and it'd be a catastrophe if the madman who stole it were to damage or destroy it Let's trust that it will turn up intact For what reason could it have been stolen? What will they do with it? Scotland Yard is very efﬁcient, they'll ﬁnd it, I'm absolutely certain Would you like to see my little greenhouse? I cultivate lotus too Come, let's go This is my books manuscript Sanofed, your words helped me very much I'm glad that was the case I'll be by your side whenever you may need me About my father's accident... I didn't tell you everything My mother had an Egyptian lover He had found out all about it That party was very important to my mother, she had planned to meet that man so they could run away together I understood that love, that's why when my father arrived I wanted to intervene on her behalf, but he managed to convince her to return to his side When we were going back home the accident happened My mother died I've never forgiven him If he had let her go she'd still be alive Helen, I feel a special affection towards you that I wouldn't be able to explain and I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you Let me give you some advice: distance yourself from us, from Assad Bey and myself Distance yourself That woman is Amarna! I need her! She will accompany me eternally I can't believe it, what reason could Assad have to commit all those crimes? I don't know, but I'm sure the key to all this is in his house I have to get in there and search it What are you trying to say? We'll watch the area, and when they leave we'll try to get in I'm sure I'm not mistaken! You're obsessed with that idea We'll go this very night, that is, if you want to come with me, if not I'll go alone I'll go with you, surely we'll end up at the police station for breaking and entering I don't know, I can't help it, but I'm sure Assad Bey is the one responsible for everything that's been happening Do you have some proof, some evidence? What you allege is very serious I don't know, there's something I don't understand - That afternoon when we were in his home - I'm going to go lie down, I'm very tired. Goodnight - Goodnight Wouldn't it be better to tell the police about your suspicions? That's what I think I'll do it when I have the slightest proof - Shall we go Abigail? - Yes, whenever you please - Then goodnight - Goodnight Thank you - Does the gentleman need anything else? - No, you can go Goodnight sir Nathan, this is useless, we should leave No, this is our opportunity, everyone's gone. Let's go Wait here Please Nathan, this is absurd We'll come back. We have to get in there No, it's not possible! Calm down, calm down Helen has disappeared, we should call the police Assad, he dominates you completely and separates you from me He's using us, and later he'll destroy us or what's worse, he will make us into his slaves I carry his blood, his very blood and he'll respect me, he'll grant me inﬁnite power He will make me immortal The night of the ﬁnal rite is approaching We'll mummify Helen and Amarna will ﬁnd her shell Afterwards we'll be more powerful than life or death We'll possess all the secrets of the lost civilizations, the world will be ours, and the dominion of the pharaohs will rise once again Professor Stark, a hunch isn't sufﬁcient cause for the police There isn't enough evidence to order a search warrant and besides, Mr. Bey is a foreign subject, it could cause a very delicate situation But I'm sure that the necessary proof is in that house! We have different proof that leads us very far from him Commissioner, it's very clear He's a maniacal fanatic, he performs blood rites before that dusty mummy, believe me! That's just a theory, and Scotland Yard requires proof, we'll ask for more information from his homeland You can be sure we'll do everything necessary once we have that in our hands Good day Professor The astral conjunction is propitious and we shall perform the great rite We will mummify this body and Amarna's spirit will enter it You shall be rewarded Assad For the great ritual of Sothis I want Sanofed's blood, that's why I ask you to sacriﬁce her, that way I can be sure you deserve everything I shall give you, only in that way We have to get in by any means It will be dangerous Follow me Idiots! Now you know my secret That will cost you your lives Tonight you will be sacriﬁced at the great ritual Let's go Commissioner, we've received the ﬁle on Assad Bey from Cairo Come with me, and have three men come too Where is Sanofed? I need her blood I don't suppose you've decided to betray me? I would never do that Where is she? What is she doing? Watching the prisoners Bring them all immediately We have to ﬁnd Helen Let's go Sergeant Look for a way in Peters, Jones, that way, Brown, come with me Lord! Professor Stark, is this the mummy that disappeared from the Lassbury Foundation? - But sir... - Quiet you ls this it? Yes Commissioner, this is the mummy The End Translation: Turdis August 2009
