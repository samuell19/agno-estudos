SECOND SKIN Alberto? Alberto, are you there? Leave a message after the beep. If you're at work again I'll kill you. We have to do the shopping, the fridge is empty. And we have to go to the cleaners, and pick up the little one. So... call me, all right? Bye. Hey, Rafa. Can you clean up? I'm late. Relax. When I finish this proof. - Are you in a hurry? - Yes. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, Ana. - Bye, Elena. Adrian! I'm coming! Not "coming". Come! Bye. The one time they play with me... - how was school, honey? - Fine. Bye, Adrian. We'll call you. We're always loaded up like mules. What can we do? Don't drag the suit, Adrian. Nice try, Adrian. Here. What's this? Its from the cleaners. Papers from Daddy's pockets. Ugh! You stink! Who needs a bath? - Me. - Go on. Bathtime. Mummy, I'm hungry! What's for dinner? What's for dinner? Pasta. Come on, Adrian. Take a bath. HOTEL FLORIDA ROOM: 16,000 PESETAS ROOM SERVICE: 3,000 PESETAS hi. What a traffic jam! - How are you? - Fine. - Where's the little one? - In the bath. I'm starving. Let's go out for dinner. No, I don't feel like it. Yes, come on. I'm in the mood. Monster! No, I'm already making dinner. - No? - No. I called your cell phone. You had it turned off. The battery must be dead. I was going to ask if you wanted me to pick up your suit. But I did it anyway. Its over there. Thanks. I'll take care of everything tomorrow. I'll set the table. This morning I bought a great book. Its a study about sexual practice in long-term couples. What for? Well, it just seems lately we don't fuck very much. Doesn't that worry you? I think what matters is the relationship, and loving each other. Sex is an automatic thing. There's no mystery to it. Well this might seem strange to you, but... lately I've forgotten that it even exists. I don't know. When I think about it, I lose interest. They're just phases. Alberto, should I see a psychologist? I don't know. Is it that serious? Maybe you should, too. Things are happening to you as well. What's wrong, Elena? Look... If you want to see a shrink, that's fine with me. But you'll go alone. Count me out. If you have a problem, you must see to it if you want to resolve it. We'll deal with it. - Right? - Yes. Well, well, well. Well, well, well... Stop it. Stop it! Stop. Your impulses always take me by surprise. Stop it. - Sorry. - No, I like it. I like it a lot. Didn't we make plans for later? Since you said you don't work Thursdays... I'll just leave then... You're not leaving! Come here. Yes, yes, yes. Hotel Canciller, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Is Alberto Garcia staying in the hotel? - One moment, please. - Yes. - No, he isn't. - He isn't. Thank you. Could you please tell me if he was there on the 2nd of this month? - Wait one moment. - Yes, I'll wait. Thank you. - Are you there? - Yes. Yes, he was here last Thursday. Very kind, thank you. Harder! Harder! No way. Sorry. Its work. I really hate cell phones. If someone's phone rings in surgery they have to buy lunch. - My boss has a fit. - Even the patient? - Especially. - What if he dies? If he dies, there's more for the rest of us. I love your flat. What's yours like? I'd like to see it. A normal apartment. I'm not there very often. - Are you leaving now? - Yes. How can you leave when I made you a fantastic dinner? What's your favourite? Guess. Your favourite food. No... - No... - What is it? - Guacamole. - Guacamole with... With lots of lemon and loaded with salt. So stay and tell them to call someone else. - I can't. - Please. I can't. I wish I could. - Come on. - I can't, Diego. I can't. When there's an emergency at the airport I have to go. I have to go. Come on. Please. I can't, I can't, I can't. You know what I'd really like? To just lose ourselves, far away from all this. I'd break that cell phone into pieces. Where the sea ends. What's that? When I went to the beach as a child, I used to love running into the water. I'd run as far as I could. - How far? - I mean, as far as I could before the waves would throw me. The waves threw you? It drove my mother crazy. - Where were you running to? - "To where the sea ends." People watched as if to say: "That boy is stupid." I was so embarrassed. I'd spend the rest of the day alone. Alone fishing in the rocks. Is a nice story, but the sea never ends. When you think it stops, it starts again. I'm sorry. I've got a conference next week. Want to come? Sure. Really? Yes. Great! Great! I'll call you tomorrow to plan the trip. Okay. - But call me. - I will. I'll walk you to the door. No, no, no. You don't have to. You don't have to. I think this was the best time I've had in my whole life. - Bye. - Bye. See you tomorrow. Go on, tiger. Mummy, we're home. Hi. Nice haircut! - You like it? - Yeah. Come here. - How are you, honey? - Fine. - Is short. - I know. I spoke to Aitor's mother. You can stay - the night. - Really? - Yes. - All right! You'd think we mistreated you. At Aitor's house we get frozen pizza for dinner. You're such a sweetie! They're waiting. Get your things. - Got everything? - Yes. See you tomorrow. - Bye, Daddy. - Enjoy the pizza. You like it? Yes. - Is different. - You don't like it. I do. I love it. I have more news. Really? Well then? Wait. You look hot. Sizzling. What about dinner? What's this? What? What? You'll never change. You have to ruin everything. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. Come on. I say we have to talk, and you ignore me. I say we need help, and you ignore me. Now I want to be with you, and you ignore me. Do you ignore everything? What do you mean, no? You always do whatever you want. We moved here because you wanted to. You know I don't like it here. But Elena, you found the house. - You found the house. - So what? You didn't have time to look! Remember? Alberto. Why are you sleeping with that woman? I'm not sleeping with anybody. You're not? Of course you are. I saw the hotel bill. Did you think I wouldn't find out? You think I'm stupid? Where were you during your shift? Tell me. What were you doing? Look at me! Who is she? - Who is she? - Someone. You don't know her. We studied together. Elena, tell me the truth. You've never thought of being with someone else? No. Well, I have! You're the one I love. And I love you. Please. Listen to me. Is nothing. It doesn't mean anything. Absolutely nothing. Forgive me. I don't know What's wrong with me. I'm tired. I work too much. You do, too. Forgive me. It only happened once. I swear it will never happen again. Alberto. I just don't know where you are. Movistar, operator. I've been calling this cell phone since yesterday, but is always off or out of range. Could you please try it? What's the number, please. Yeah, is 608... ...700202. - One moment. - Thank you. Everything's normal. Great, thanks. Could you give me the owner's address? - Can I have his name, please? - Alberto Garcia. - His address, please? - No, I don't know his address. - I'm afraid I can't help you. - Right. I understand. Thank you. All right. Hello? Hi. Where are you? With you. You could have called to say you weren't coming. Shut up and go out on the terrace. Come on. What for? Just do it. Go out on the terrace. But why? Over here, over here. What are you doing here? Are you crazy? Wait, I'll be right up. I can only stay tonight, Diego. Why? I have the nightshift tomorrow. I have to go in. Isn't tomorrow Sunday? So? You never work Sundays? Yes. Aren't you glad I'm here? Very. I thought... Did you come by motorbike? Yeah. Is near here. But don't you guys fly everywhere? No. Is much prettier on a motorcycle. Tell me about it. I earn a living operating on bikers like you who crack their heads open. You know why I came? Why? Because this morning I woke up and I couldn't stop thinking about you. I love you, Diego. I will for a long time. Is that true? - Hi, Viviana! - What's up? - How are you? - Fine. - You look great. - Thanks. - This is Quique. - How's it going? - Hello. - Where have you been? Alberto showed up. - Alberto, the famous Eva. - Alberto. I was looking forward to meeting you. Hey, you missed the Carvajal conference. What can I say? How was it? Excellent, as usual. Let's go out for dinner. Where should we go? The dinner's here, Diego. Let's skip it. Dinner, too? Yes. You two go ahead. I'll grab something in the bar. What are you saying? There's plenty of room. Someone always misses it. Of course. We'll make room for you to come with us. No, don't worry about me. I can meet some friends nearby. What? But you came all this way. We'll go to the port. Look, I'd better meet my friends. We'll hook up later. What do you want to drink? Here's the plan. Tonight we'll stay in, and tomorrow you'll get up early. We'll have food delivered. - Is decided. - Listen, Diego. If I say I want to meet my friends for dinner, then that's what I want. Diego, I'm going to have a drink. Take this, and call me when you figure things out. Bye. Don't drive me crazy, please. - Are you really leaving? - Yes. And be careful. Everyone's going to find out. Shit. Why did you tell her? What? About us? Yeah. Why? I didn't tell her a thing, Alberto. No. You told her. This affects me, Diego. You come here, you miss dinner and ignore your friends... Why did you come? Because its my job, Alberto. I see these doctors everyday and I like them, but right now... I prefer to be with you. I love you. Its that simple. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Shall we go? - Let's go. Let's go. - Hello. - Hi. You know Diego. This is his friend Alberto. He's a doctor. - Nice to meet you. - How are you? - Javier, right? - That's right. - You remember him? - Sorry. - From Barcelona. - Right. - You met in Barcelona. - Of course. We're anesthesiologists. Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. I want to try a little of that cake. - Here. What's that? - Its cheese. - How about a toast? - A toast, a toast. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here all alone? - I'll buy you a drink. - No, I have one. Bottoms up. There's something wrong, Eva. He's very strange. Did you see him looking at me at dinner? I don't know if he wanted to seduce me or kill me. No, I didn't notice. You didn't notice many things, my love. The better things get with us, the more he complicates things. Do you want some advice? I don't know, let's see. - Give it to me. - Stay with me. Don't get nervous, but I'm the best man you can get. Have you ever liked any of my stories? No. I'm going inside to look for men. I'll be right there. Maybe I don't love you. How are things? Alberto, Alberto. One second. - Don't be long. - Okay. - You're leaving with them? - You want to come for a drink? Do you care what people think? I'm asking, because people don't care, Alberto. They don't care at all. Who do you think you are? Yes. All right. I know people don't care. But I'm not like that. - Like what? - Like that, Christ! I'm not like that. Are you guys coming? - Yes, I'll be right there. - Come on. Are you coming or not? No. Go ahead. Go. No? Fine. - Are you coming with us? - No. - Come on. - I'm tired. - Take care, all right? - I will. Take care. I'm coming. Why are you playing games? Please, Diego. Let me sleep. I have to leave in 2 hours. Did you have fun last night? I don't know. I don't understand, but I'm sorry I upset you. Diego, can you let me sleep? Is that so difficult to understand? Why did you come? Why did you come? Okay. Leave it there. Thanks. Good morning. - How are you? - Fine. - And you? - Fine. Have breakfast with me. - Don't you want to? - No. Why do you look so horrible? I haven't slept all night. Did he come back? Yes. But we're finished. Its over. Indefinitely? I came alone, I leave alone. I haven't lost so much. How was last night? Good. You want to know if I saw him? Yes, I saw him. And I don't like him at all. Dad's cell phone. How strange. That's not like him. There are messages. Give me that, nosy! You have new messages. First message, sent at 9:16... - Mummy, What's wrong? - Nothing. Can I go play at Aitor's house? Be back before lunch. Okay. Hello? Hello. How was it? Where have you been? What? You're not going to tell me. You forgot your cell phone. Here it is. You have a lot of messages. Some are mine. One's from your brother. And there are others... that made me sick. Elena... Elena. Let me explain, please. There's nothing to explain. It doesn't matter. I don't know what's wrong with me lately. I start crying without knowing why. Is just that... I feel this huge void. Please, don't leave me. I need both of you, you and Adrian. Please. I need help. Please. What should I do? Tell me and I'll do it. I'll come back when things get better. Alberto, I can't be a man. This is a serious fracture of the tibia. Look. Is surgery free tomorrow? Yes, we had to cancel the hip replacement. Why? Lack of blood. Well... Prepare this for tomorrow. Yes, doctor. All right. Take this away. - Thank you. - See you later. - Alberto Garcia, please. - One moment. Dad, its for you. Say I'm not home. He's not home yet. - Tell him I'll call back. - I'll tell him. Bye. Why don't you ever answer? Because I'm tired. It was that man again. It must be the doctor who fixed my arm. I'll call him tomorrow. Shall we go buy that tracksuit we saw? Okay! Tomorrow when you get out of school. - Are you finished yet? - Yes. Then go to bed. I'll be right there. Here. Doctor. I'll finish up. Long scalpel, please. Why did you do that in front of the team, Eva? - You want me to explain? - Yes, please. Because you're obsessed. Why shouldn't I be if I call his house and a child answers? His cell phone says he's changed numbers. I just don't understand how you can leave files undone, cancel consultations, and abandon in surgery. No, Eva. I won't give you that one. It was only - twice. I warned you both times. - Twice? For you that's unforgivable. You can't play around with this job. Okay, but what happened when you separated from your husband? What are you saying? I remind you that for a month I took care of everything for you, sweetheart! Eva, wait. Its obvious, you know. What's obvious, Eva? You'll see. - Everyone goes through it. - I know. But it hurts. Sure it does. Death is the only thing that doesn't. Yeah. How absurd. Come here. - I'll buy you lunch, silly! - No, its on me. No. Its time. I'm going to stay and finish this. Can I stay and give you a hand? I don't mind. No, go ahead and close. I'm almost finished. - You're not in a rush today? - No. Its such a drag to go home. If you want we can get a beer. I'd better go. My mother will think I've jumped off a bridge. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Then call and say you'll be late. She won't throw you out for having a beer with me. Elena, are you leaving? Yes. I want to take Adrian to school. I've got a hangover. How are you? Last night... Don't tell anyone, okay? I don't go telling people my intimacies. - Can you talk for a second? - No. Sorry. I'm late, really. You all know the great monsters of the twentieth century. Godzilla, the Loch Ness Monster, the Wolfman, the Bogeyman, and the most terrible of all, cellulite. It reminds me of my mother. My father never let her paint her nails. And her hands were so pretty. - Sexism. - What? Your grandfather was sexist and old-fashioned. ...And they asked why he couldn't have baby food... Oh, God. It kills me to see you put up with that bum. He doesn't deserve you. I never liked him. And the boy. Poor thing. Maybe he has a lover. You're crazy, mum. If you're sure he doesn't, you should see a lawyer. You've left the house and he can take it all away from you. Luis Garcia Bravo is a friend. He won't charge you. Alberto won't take Adrian. Don't be ridiculous. Its a bad phase. It will pass. Oh, God... - What's wrong? - Nothing. My knees hurt today. Could you get that, please? My mother is home. Can I come in? Who is it? Its Alberto. Elena. Hi, Maria Elena. How are you? Hi, Alberto. Is everything all right? - Let's go. - Yes. Nice to see you. - She's intolerable. - So are you. Who would move into her house? I mean, if you want I'll leave. Yeah, you come here to live with her. What fun you two will have. Elena. What? I want you to know I haven't seen him since. You're the one I love. Is not about that. Then what's it about? I don't know. How's Adrian? Fine. He wants you to come back. I can't. Why? Because I don't believe you. I don't believe a word you say. Then I'll leave. For as long as it takes. Until you believe me. What did I do wrong that drove you to the arms of a man? No, no. You? You did nothing wrong. Its me. It was me. It was a mistake. I've forgotten all about it. Its past. It doesn't matter. Then what's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I want to fall in love with someone else but I only love you. Diego, aren't you home yet? Call me. I need some clinical background for tomorrow's operation. Bye. Hey, we waited for you until one and... hi, Diego. Is Raquel. You're impossible to reach. We're calling from the bookshop. Your order's ready. If you want, we can deliver it to your house. So we need to check the extractor, - and both fuel filters... - All right. Excuse me. - Yes? Who are you looking for? - Alberto Garcia. Alberto Garcia? In the office. There he is. - Thank you. - See you later. ...but I sent it yesterday personally. Fine, but they called me at 10:30 saying... Wait... Excuse me. - Saying it hadn't arrived. - I'll have Maite - send it again. - Relax. Hi. What are you doing here? Why didn't you call first? - I did call you. - Yeah? I left a message. Didn't the boy tell you? Yeah, I'm just really busy. Have a seat. - How are you? - Fine. Diego, I want to talk to you. Me, too. I brought you this. - Here. - Thanks. Open it! Is not a bomb, is a book. Open it. Later. At home. You're not going to open it? I prefer to open it at home. Good-bye, Alberto. Diego. I just wanted to say, despite everything, I miss you, Alberto. I just wanted you to know. Wait, wait. Can we talk sometime alone at your house? - Anytime. - Tomorrow? No, I can't tomorrow. I have the nightshift and I'll be up late. Give me a day, Alberto. Wednesday at four. Wednesday at four. Yes. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. How are you? - I can't shake your hand. - Don't worry. Is everything okay? - Where's Elena? - Downstairs. She'll be right up. You've made some changes, eh? When we bought the new printers. Almost two years ago. - How are you, Ana? - Alberto. What are you doing here? Hi. How are you? I bought you a gift. How pretty. It must have cost a lot. Guess where we're going for dinner? We have a lot of work to do. Can't they do it? Ana. - What? - Can you guys finish up? Sure. You two go ahead. - See you later. - Bye. - See you later, Rafa. - Let's stop by home on the way. So what do you think of the transfer? They're expanding the airports. I think for a child is better to live in a small city near the sea and with nice weather. We'd be much happier. What about my job? I thought you could do it via the internet. - Isn't it all by computer? - Yes, via satellite like astronauts. Then it wouldn't be so bad. I'm serious. What do you think? - Aren't those public jobs? - I'll take the exams. Besides, my friend's brother said he'd buy our house and with that money we could buy something even bigger. Excuse me. No, its for him. Thank you. - Bon appetit. - Thank you. Well then? I don't know, Alberto. I don't think we're ready for a decision like this. Why not? Because we were about to break up and anything could happen. We know what will happen. I know exactly what I want. I want to live somewhere else and have another child with you. What are you saying? I don't want another child right now. Why not? Because we have to wait. - Alberto. - What? If you want this to work, we have to talk seriously. But things are different now. We talk more, we're together a lot more, and I've changed, haven't I? You've stopped seeing him but that doesn't fix everything. I don't know. I don't understand you. Its very simple. If you want this to continue, we have to start over. And talk about us. How long have you been sleeping with men? You still won't tell me? Excuse me. Alberto, are you okay? Elena, help me. All right. We're going to do the hip replacement in 10 days. We'll do the meniscus block tomorrow, okay? Got that, Diego? Diego. Write it down. You make me feel like a teacher giving homework. I'm leaving, my love. Really? See you tomorrow then! I've got plans. I told you yesterday. Have you got a problem with me? No. Well then? - Personal stuff. I'm sorry. - Well, this personal stuff is costing you a lot of money. First of all, I didn't choose this job for the money. And secondly, you're speaking nonsense. Then why do you work in a private clinic that charges two million pesetas for a hip operation? Maybe you're the one who has a problem with me. No. No. I don't know. I can't stand to see you get hurt. If you don't want to see me get hurt, take a deep breath, relax, and shut up. You're not helping anyone like this. I'll get over this, Eva. Of course you will. But I might not still be here for you when you do. Well, then... Forget me and find someone else. Shit! I'm finished. I'm leaving. There's a tray with coffee and everything. Although it got cold. Call me if you need anything. Fine. Thanks, Tomasa. See you Wednesday. - See you Wednesday, thanks. - Bye. Wait. I'll go down with you. - Why didn't you come? - I told you. - I'm busy. Its my job. - No. No. Diego, I love you. Why do you tell me these things, Alberto? Don't you see its unnecessary? Listen... I haven't called you because I wanted to work things out. Filthy thoughts are better kept at home. What filth? The shit we carry inside. You mean that I'm nothing but shit to you? I don't know. I don't know what I mean. Its simple. Its either right or its wrong. Do you like being with me? Wait a second. What are you so afraid of? Who cares? We're together now. And I want to be with you. Alberto? Alberto, where are you? Your voicemail always picks up. I've been waiting over a half an hour. We have to buy Adrian's gifts, remember? Fine. I'll just buy whatever I see. Bye. Children, its already 8:30 and you have school tomorrow. Start saying good-bye. - Shall I walk you home? - No, that's all right. We can cross the street alone. - Did you have fun? - Yes. - Bye. - Bye, Adrian. - Happy birthday, Adrian. - Bye. They've left. Mummy, What's the matter? Are you tired? No, honey. I'm not tired. - I'm a little sad. - Why? I don't think your father and I will be able to solve our problems. Are you getting a divorce? - Shall I turn this off? - No, I'm staying. - Okay. See you tomorrow, Rafa. - See you tomorrow. - Take out the trash, Ana. - Okay. - I didn't know you're smoking again. - Neither did I. - Shall we go for a drink? - I'll buy you dinner. Okay. When I finish this proof. I'll buy you dinner, then we'll get a drink, whatever. - You're so strange. - Me? Why haven't you ever asked before? Because I don't like mixing things up. Besides, I don't have a husband anymore, and Adrian's with my mother. I'm free as a bird. - I'm sorry about your separation. - Don't be. I'm fine with it. We'd been together since school. I've never been alone. I went from living with my parents to a husband a child. I'm enjoying it. - Really? - Yes. I love being alone. You have time for more things, and you don't have to check with everyone all the time. I left Adrian with my mother. Did I already say that? What can I say? You live in that fantastic apartment. - Did I tell you I loved your place? - No, you didn't. Well, I do. I'm thinking of selling mine and moving into town. Something in your area. If you know of anything... My place. What? My place is free and I think its for sale. - You're moving? - Yes, I'm going to Valencia. When? As soon as I can, when I find a tenant. I was going to tell you. I want to start painting again. And you have to leave? Well, I met someone. Actually, I already knew her from school. She lives there. And? I'm in love with her. Elena, What's wrong? Nothing. I have to go. Tell me. Why the long face? My face isn't long. It isn't? When I said I was leaving it upset you. No. Leave if you want, but more lies. Before you wanted to have dinner with me. - You've nowhere else to go... - hey, hey! That's my business. Elena, I really liked you. But you led me to believe I had no chance. What was I to do? I'm sorry. Hey. Excuse me. - Are you Diego? - Yes. My name's Elena. I'm Alberto's wife. What? What else did she say? That you two had a son, that you just broke up, that she's known about me for a while, and she needed to meet me. And that you're lying. You're lying. All that will change. I'm already separated. Of course. But you think a woman will want to live with a faggot? But you're even lucky in that. Once again we do the dirty work for you. You don't have to leave her. She left you. You knew the truth about me. No, I didn't. You wouldn't let me. Wait a second. Aren't things good enough exactly as they are? Isn't it enough? I live alone. We see more of each other, as often as I can! You have no right to demand more of me! I'm not demanding anything. I just want you to understand me. The real me. You could do the same! Are you all right? I don't know. What's going to happen now? Its hard for me... to lie. It was so easy before. It was as if they weren't lies, as if built in another life. As if the pain I caused weren't my own. But now I can't. You're better off, Alberto. No, Diego. That's what I'm saying. I've been lying since I was a kid. You think I like being shut in that hangar all day? I hate it. I hated university, I hated all my classmates. Above all because it was my father's profession, and my grandfather's. I've spent my entire life passing everyone's tests. Is time to start being yourself. If that's not me... If I'm not that Alberto... Then who am I? You can't go on like this. I can't go on like what? Like you are now. I don't know. Should we forget it? I don't know. Neither of us feel right... Let's start over, please. From zero. We can't, Diego. Don't you see that I wouldn't be able to change even if I wanted to? Even if I try, I can't. I don't agree. That's how it is. It is? Then I'm leaving. And I insist that we never see each other again! Never again, please. No, no, no. Please. I'll leave. Please, no. Lord, give Alberto eternal rest, and let the eternal light shine for him. May he rest in peace. May his soul and those of all victims of earth's misery rest in peace. Amen. You may all go in peace. Thanks to the Lord. Elena. Elena, I'm sorry. Hi. Can I talk to you? This isn't a good time. Just one minute, please. Another day I might not be able to go through with it. If you've come for his things, go ahead. I don't want anything. I'm cleaning out my house. Why? Living there is horrible. Especially at night. Nights are terrible. They're terrible. I really wanted to see you, Elena. And to talk to you. There's nothing to say. Is all clear. I've seen many of his notes, they were among the papers on his desk. They spoke of you, of me, of Adrian... of what he wanted to be. He always wanted to be something else. When I heard your voice on the machine and I realized, it was horrible. Later it wasn't such a big deal that you were a man, it was that I saw clearly that our relationship was doomed. I didn't want to see it. As if by avoiding things I could make them disappear. How are you? I'm going back to work. All that's left are moments of very happy days, and I need to stay busy to forget them. Can we walk a bit? Yes. I have to pick up Adrian from school. Want to come with me?
