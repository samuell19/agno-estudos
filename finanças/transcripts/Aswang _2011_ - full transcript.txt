Most people think we only live within someone's imagination, but we're real. We once spread fear. And now, we're just waiting for the right time... to return. Are you going to take longer? I'm just going to finish it up to the dike. - Let me do it. - I know this well. Okay. Come home before it gets dark. (crow cawing) (crow cawing) (crow cawing) Guada, run! Manuel! Run to the rocks! Manuel! Manuel! You said it's 3 pm. They're coming. You're all wet. None of your business! Hey, pretty boy! What time are they coming? The secretary said it's 3 o'clock. 3 o'clock? - Looks like our watch is broken. - I can't take this anymore. Queenie, don't waste the gas. Carbon monoxide, global warming, that's why the Earth is getting destroyed. When papa comes, turn it off already. Ahnia! Oh fine! - Domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order. - See what happened? It's game over. - Family, genus, species. - There! You lose! Ahnia, turn the volume down. Fine! - Domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order... family! - Family, genus, species. - There! There they are. You're all too excited. Time to roll. Ahnia, your dad's downstairs. - Turn it off. - Yes, mama. Who's there? -Is attorney home? - He's here, ma'am. What about his wife? She's here too. Who are you? We're his friends. Come in. Come in? Ahh! Ahh! What's that? No! - Where are you going? - Wait! Oh, My God! No! You know what, Attorney? Sorry. What was that? Case dismissed. Excuse me. Mama? Let's go. Let's go. Guess what? After this, I'll put holes on the face of that Daniel. There are classes today, right? Today is Holiday. Kids? Kids, get out of there. Go to your mom. She's sick. - Pa. - Papa! Daniel! The kids! What did you say? - The kids are outside. - What? - Hurry, Ahnia. - Yes. There they are. No! - What happened? - Chief! - It's done. - Good! The thing is... there's a hole in the plan. Some got away. Why? Attorney's children were there when we killed them. The kids are already gone too? They got away. Now, it's traffic. We can't run after them. That's what I'm talking about. It's because of Daniel. Smooth move. Don't worry. I'll take care of him later. Do we have to run after the kids? Do you want to get paid? I'm just asking a question, chief. Wait for Anton's text. You're dead. Kuya (older brother), why don't you want to go there? I remembered what daddy told mommy last week... Whatever happens, don't seek help from the police. What are we going to do? I don't know. - Ruel! Hurry! - Sir! You know Attorney Arguelles' kids, right? - Yes. - Good. Kuya... Where are we going? To Uncle Randy in Pampanga. A police on duty during the crime scene just reported us that a massacre has taken place here in the house of Attorney Lito Arguelles. Approximately five people were found unconscious or dead inside the house. Included here is Attorney Lito Arguelles and his wife, their two maids and one bodyguard. We still don't know if the two children, Gabriel and Ahnia Arguelles are included to the victims. Until now, the location of the two children hasn't been found. According to our interview with Chief Superintendent Anton Magisa, there's still no confirmed motives from the killers, but it has a possible connection to the big issue about a commercial lot on Agham Avenue. I told you to go with your brother, the seaman. You could've left already. But I don't want to leave. Then why were you sobbing? What I said was Mayor is taking so long to get the street done. The hell if the abwaks come back again! The church took 2 years before having it cemented. Stop getting drunk. You might get eaten by an abwak. - Lily, we'll let you bite us instead. - What's abwak? Will you stop it?! Go home! It isn't abwaks' time yet. - Oh My! Damn people! - Let's go. - We're done? - Lily's snobbish today. Come on. Jake care, dude. Let's go. - Okay. Take care. (crow cawing) (crow cawing) Hey. Lucky day. Ahh! Ahh! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. - Blessed are you amongst women... - Ahnia. Ahnia. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Kuya. Hail Mary, full of grace, - It's so hot here. - Sir. Do you know where the town Tumana is? - Where's Tumana? - Tumana? - It's near Biroy, right? - There's no Tumana there. I don't know that. You can ask directions at the town proper. - Good morning, chief. - You took so long. Sorry, we got lost. Where are we? I don't know. I ran out of gas. I wasn't even given money for gas. Turn right. Are you sure? Just a hunch. - I haven't even had lunch. Pretty boy. Queenie said take the right turn. You might take it on me again. Bro, you might have money for gas. Bye, chief! Damn it! St. Isidore, help us. We beg you Father for the bounty grace for our land. St. Isidore, help us. We beg you, Father for the bounty grace for our land. St. Isidore, help us. (crow cawing) The abwaks are here! Run now! Run! Run now! Run! (crow cawing) Kuya, what's that? You can't stay here. Come with me. Kuya! Run! Hurry! Here! Here! What's happening here?! It's not safe here. Where are you from? Come on. Manang Guada (old lady)! Manang Guada! Hurry, get inside. Let's just wait here. Kuya, I saw the monster. Shh! What are those? They are called abwak. They usually attack every April or May. I don't understand why they're starting this early. They are a kind of monster. If others can change into a pig or a dog. An abwak can be a crow or a lizard who passes through underground. We don't know where they came from. They were already here since the time of my grandparents. Some families already left but most of us learned to endure. What the hell?! Oh, pretty boy... That's a pothole. Town of Tumana, you said? - Yes. - There's no town of that name here. Maybe it's in another city. I'm not sure of the name. We rarely go there. Where did you come from? Did you run away? No. Manang Guada, can we let them eat and rest first? I'll come back for them if I'm sure it's safe outside. Okay, Hasmin. - Take care. - Yes. What is it? Nothing. Just a ghost. A ghost? It seems it's already quiet outside. I hope they won't follow us here. What is she doing here? The abwaks are gone. Good morning, ma'am! Why do you have to come here now? We've been looking for two kids. They left the car in front of... Ah yes. There were two kids who joined the procession. I have no idea where they are now. We suddenly ran when the abwaks came. But are they here in town? I don't know. Maybe they're at the nipa huts. Just check it out. Thank you. Oh! Don't stay here in our town too long. You'll just get in trouble. Okay. What did she say abwak is? A monitor lizard? Lizards? So what's the plan? We'll split up. Make your own moves. We just have to meet up here by 1 oâ€™clock. Queenie. Queenie. Daniel. Do your job. You've made too many mistakes... Or else... Are you contented with your life, father? All the people here are prisoners. Leave this place while you still have time. That's only 15 pesos. Take it. That's the last piece. I once had this kind of clip when I was young. It was given to me by my sister. You're from the plantation, right? You're so beautiful. I hope to see you here in town more often. Women here are ugly. Ouch. It looks good on you, Miss. Maybe next time. I don't have money. Bye. You have one of a kind street here. The middle part isn't cemented. It wasn't finished because Mayor was in a hurry. We will run out of voters if all of us were eaten. Soy bean curd! Soy bean curd! Mister... Outsiders are not allowed here. Is asking a question not allowed too? Okay. Never mind. Why are you following me? I'm just going to give you this. I told you it looks good on you. You run fast. You're faster. Don't follow. There are lots of animals around. What's your name? Miss! My husband is the one in the picture. - Grandma... - I'm blind, my dear. Ahnia, stop bothering Manang. Let her be. I rarely have visitors. Except when Hasmin visits me. Is Hasmin your daughter? No. She's just my friend. She takes care of me whenever she visits. She brings me things that I need. Where did you come from? From Manila. Where are your parents? They're dead. Mom. Boss sent us to a province. How's Rodel? How about Nina? Okay, mom. I'll send you money by the end of the month. Take care. Tell them I called. Dad! Dad! (Crow cawing) (Crow cawing) (Crow cawing) Don't come near! Thief! Help me! Thief! Give me the cellphone. You're so stupid entering a dead end. Sir, you're the stupid one who ran after me. Asshole! Do you want to die here?! Finally, I found you. You're one of them who killed my father. Go on! I even want to hunt down your driver. But good for him, I didn't see his face. That's why I'll put more bullet holes in you instead. I'm just here. What a cute girl. Hi, baby girl. Baby girl, don't run. Baby girl, stop hiding. Uncle Gido's already tired. Don't you want to be with mommy and... Ate (older girl) Hasmin. Let's go. Ahnia, where have you been? Kuya, I saw him! Who? The one who shot papa! Who's running after the kids? What's happening? Get in. Hurry. The kids are in danger. What happened to you? I slid down the river. Stupid boy got ten points! The kids are here. I saw the girl. So what's the plan? We're going to look for them. What? We have to look in each and every house. Wait. Let's put it this way. Since, I'm sure the kids won't be able to get out of this place, why don't we eat or take a bath somewhere. We're going to take a bath together? No. Queenie, are you going to take a bath in the river? Don't! There are animals. You just saw an abwak? Miss, why is there a lot of lizards here? Abwak isn't a lizard. You have to bring the kids in San Rafael. There are more people who can help them. You know what I mean about the people here. Gabriel, Ahnia, you should stay here for tonight. I'll come back for you tomorrow morning. We'll walk to the next town. That's only 2 hours away. Won't they get mad at you? I'll take care of that. I just have to go home now because I might not be able to go out tomorrow if my sister gets mad at me. Stay here, okay? See the streets? It's cemented up to the end so that the abwa'ks won't be able to reach here. Abwak... The nipa huts in front are the only ones left undone. Maybe mayor ran out of money. Why doesn't he ask for money from the plantation? They don't even visit here. - We only get free sugar and sugar canes. - Pretty boy... Go around the place. You might see the kids. What are you going to do when you see them? - Call you. - Very good! I'm just here. Listen to me, Daniel. Even though people behind me want to kill you so badly, I won't let them. Because you know, you're good. Street smart. I admit, sometimes my crew are a bit stupid. But you're different. Because you were able to find them one by one. So, here's the deal, I'll hire you as a hitman. So you'll be able to pay me your debts. - Damn it! - Let's say... ten targets. Five targets in exchange for one of my boys you killed. What if I don't want to? It's payback time. I know where your mother lives. I'll pay you. Don't worry. I'm a good man. So, is it a deal? Daniel. How do you know my name? Hasmin. Hasmin is my name. Hasmin. Sorry about earlier in the woods. What happened to you? I can't remember. I was following you and then... I just woke up by the river. My clothes were dripping wet. I think I tripped. I don't know. But I think I saw an... animal. I don't know. I can't remember. Don't go back there again. - Nice drawing. - Thank you. We're leaving. Kuya, where are we going? Gabriel? Ahnia? I was just dragged here. I know. Why do you know so much about me? Hasmin! Hasmin! The kids! Daniel! Hurry! Where is that? You. Stay here in the van. Wait for my call. You. Come with me. - Where are you?! My stomach is getting upset! - What are you doing here? Don't! She's my friend. Oh that's why we can't find you. But she's beautiful huh. Why do you have guns? Let's deal with her later. Kuya, what are we doing here? Kuya. - Ahnia! Ahnia! - Kuya! Have you seen them? - I think they passed through there. - You think? Let's go. Hurry. Queenie. Take the van here in front of the plantation. And pick up Daniel. He's just there in the streets. Ate Hasmin, do you live here? Why didn't he shoot us? He's one of papa's killers. Did you see him shoot a gun? Sometimes, there are things that we have to do even if we're against it. But it doesn't mean we could already be considered a bad person. Shh! Stay here in the meantime. Don't leave this place while I'm not here. Yes, Ate Hasmin. Kuya Efren. Are we just fooling ourselves?! I really thought they passed through there. Daniel. You can easily be blamed. Just one call from Boss Eddie. Your sister has been looking for you. If Ipo Moises found out that you went out... Ramon wasn't able to come back. He went to the river to catch food but then I think he clashed with somebody. Do you have news from the city? Mayor's asking for a donation. If not, he'll have the streets by the nipa huts cemented. I'll tell Ipo that. We won't have a passage if the street is cemented. Don't worry, Mr. Carding. About Hasmin... She went to the city again. I know. Tell the others to prepare for the wedding tomorrow. Thank you so much, Mr. Carding. Were you entertained by strolling around? If Ipo Moises finds this out, I'll be damned as well. This woman should be in chains. What are you afraid of? You know your responsibility here, Hasmin. I'll be married to him but it doesn't mean I'm a prisoner of this house. Teach your sister a lesson. I know. Daniel. Have you forgotten our deal? No. Everything is in your hands, right? But you can also fall. But you know what will happen, right? Can you handle it? It won't happen again. That's what I like about you. Let me talk to Gido. Chief. When you're done with the kids, you can kill Daniel. Thank you, chief. Whoo! Who are they, Ate Hasmin? They're the one's who took care of me and your mother. When we transferred here in the plantation, they became like our parents. Are they like us? When the plantation was still new then, Ipo hired people from the city to work here. They are one of them. Where are they now? Gone. The moment people like us spread in the plantation, Ipo decided that he doesn't need humans anymore. That's why... Good thing, we're not like other regular people. Mom said, when you and Ipo Moises get married, our race will be stronger and we will spread. What really happened to our race? It's a long story, Isabel. Our power is useless... if we need to kill just to be able to live. The day will come that we have to pay for our sins. Do a recon first. You can go tomorrow night when Anton and his gang arrive. Text back. Tomorrow? What are we going to do here now? Let's leave this place first. - We can't. If the kids went out... - What if this plantation has a different exit? We'll scout first. Hey! We'll just take a peek inside. We'll make sure there's no other exit. Are you cowards? Let's go. Gido, let's get out of here. Why did you kill mama and papa? Sorry. It's just business. Kuya! What's that? What's that? Let's make this exciting! I'm going to give you 10 seconds. Go! Who are you talking to, lady? Such a beautiful woman. Damn. - They're not humans. - I know. Queenie. Queenie! Queenie! Gido! Help me! Gido! Gido! Let's go! Let's see first where they're going. We captured one. A woman. Gido! Gido! I think no ones following. What are they? - I think that's what they call abwak. - Monsters?! - Monsters. - What about Queenie? She's dead. Wait! Are you sure?! She might still be alive! There's nothing we can do. Let's go back to the city. Gido! Gabriel? Ahnia? What are you doing? Aren't you going to move? You're not really going to move? Suit yourself! Sorry, Ahnia. We're both scared. But we can't stay here long. Kuya, don't leave me. Not anymore. - I won't leave you anymore. - You're bad. Sorry. Hop on. No thanks. Your asthma might attack. When we saw them, they were already inside. - Do you know them? - They're not from the city. They killed Bing and Franco. Mr. Carding is also in pain. Why are you here? Just a taking a trip. I'm going to ask you again. There are two kids. We were looking for them. There's a woman. She took them here. Hasmin? Is she the one you're talking about? I don't know. I didn't see what happened. Search the whole plantation. Release me! Release me! Stop! Please stop! Please stop. Are you going to say anything? Efren. You might be forgetting, she is my future wife. Forgive me. I heard what happened. They said you weren't eating. You don't want to join our people. You prefer to stroll around in the world of humans. We rarely find someone like you in our race. The power to bring back life... The power to make human become an abwak... Because of you, we now have hope. Our power will be stronger again. We'll be able to bring back the number of abwak once again. You're important to us, Hasmin. Eat with me. I'm not hungry. Is this what you're going to do on our wedding tomorrow? You'll refuse in front of everybody else?! Please stop. Please have pity. Do you want her prepared for you? So fresh. We don't eat people like you all at once. First, we bite the fingers, hands, feet, all bit by bit. After three days, we will take your blood... slowly. Am I right, Hasmin? Are you hungry now? Please don't. Hasmin! Make sure she's ready for our wedding tomorrow. If not, you know what will happen to both of you. An abwak, monsters... They're not humans, chief. Queenie's dead? I think so. How about Daniel? He's here beside me. - He should've been the one dead! - Easy. Easy. You and Daniel just stay put. Anton will arrive around 6 pm. He's assembling his group. -6 o'clock? - Gido. Gido. It's almost 3 o'clock in the morning. Take a rest. Okay. And you don't have to show off. Queenie already died because of you. Okay. Kuya, I'm scared. Who are you? We're just passing through. -Isabel. - Ate Hasmin! You don't need to do this. They are my friends. I'm going to walk them down the way out. Don't tell others. Father! Hasmin! Kuya... I heard... you were the one who took the kids here inside. I didn't mean to. Because you meddled, they won't leave this place alive. Have pity... They don't know anything about this. Now, they already know something. Because of you. Ipo! Stella! Choose, Hasmin, your sister or the kids. I apologize, Ipo... I won't make mistakes again. Stop all your stupid acts. I can't take being with all of you anymore! You're not human, Hasmin. You're an abwak! I know what I am! I just don't want to be a prisoner of this place! Tell me... what do you want to happen? Let's leave this place. Let's run away. Let's take Isabel with us. Then what are you going to do outside? Do you think human beings are going to help us? Father and mother were supposed to take us away then, right? Don't you remember who killed them? They were killed because they're traitors! Because they don't want what they're doing! Ipo Moises gave us a chance. He gave back his trust on us. If you marry him tomorrow, we will be the powerful ones in this plantation. For what?! Power for what? What is there? The kid! They found the outsiders. I just want to remind you of our rules. No abwak should step on the land of San Isidro. We can only go to the alleyways and the entry point. Because if we go inside the city, and if the people got scared and flee, we'll run out of human blood and raw meat to harvest for important occasions. We should thank mayor for not letting the entry point be cemented. So we won't have a hard time. I'm telling you this because the 2 men who shot Bong, Frankie and Mr. Carding are in the city. Ato. Hilda. Get there. Kill both of them. Whatever happens, do not change your form. You are still stronger than humans. Take revenge in the name of our brothers. Don't you want to transfer to another town? Everyone is running away. I'll take care of the expenses. My child... I don't know how to thank you for all the things you did for me. You've given me everything. I'm not leaving. Okay. Guada! Run! Manuel! Child... Do you want to come in? I was just inside the plantation last night. I know what happened. The woman you're with is dead. How about the kids? The reason I'm here is... I need your help. You know what? I really didn't want this to happen. - I had no intention of... - You don't need to explain. We both don't want this to happen. We both want to live a different life. I just need your trust now. Can you help me? Get the guns. I'll be back. Neighbors! The abwaks are here! - Hurry! Come on! - Run! Run! Daniel! Don't worry. They won't be dumping here until tomorrow. - Wait. Why do you... - Daniel... When the clock hits 6 o'clock, follow this tunnel, there's a door at the end. That's the basement of the ranch. You will find Gabriel and Ahnia there. Take this way out. - Hasmin. - Daniel. Do you trust me? Are you one of them? Wait for me at the gate of the plantation. We'll run away together. Hasmin! Hasmin. Get ready. It's already 3 oâ€™clock. Go to Ato and Hilda. Then come back right away. Boss! You took so long! Boss Eddie will just follow later. Boss! It's just us? Now what? This will do. This is the beginning of the return of our army's power with the union of Hasmin and Ipo Moises' blood. Gabriel! Ahnia! Don't be scared. Hasmin sent me here. We're going to escape. Let's go. What happened to him? He has asthma. Hurry. Hurry. Fight for the ranch! Kill them all! You! I know what you're planning. Get off me. Hurry! Run! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Ahnia! - Kuya! - Ahnia! Kuya! Kuya! - Ahnia! - Kuya! Ahnia! Hasmin. You animal. We have to escape from here... because... Daniel. - Daniel... - I don't want to die. Hasmin. I can't do it. I don't want to die yet. Gido. How many headcount in the plantation? I don't know. But I'm sure not all of them want to fight. Sir! Blow them away! I warned you what would happen if your sister refused. We've been living peacefully for generations. Now... everything's ruined. Ruined! You're useless! That's enough, Ipo! Do you know what you just did to our race? I don't care. Let go of my sister. You wasted everything. My sister! Mother! Boss! Boss! Get out of here now! I'll take care of this! Is there no end to this?! 20 points! You brought a curse to our race. You brought the curse the moment you killed our parents. Never have I desired to be a human. I have accepted that you need my power. There's only one thing I wanted to do. To kill you. - Ahnia! - Kuya! We have to go. Gabriel! Ahnia! Isabel, let's go. Come with us. We can't live here now. Isabel... Hasmin, let's go. We can't do anything. Let's go. Isabel, I'll come back for you. This is your fault. I have to get back to my family. - If Boss Eddie finds out what happened here. - Daniel... Will you be able to forgive me? I wanted this to happen, Hasmin. I don't regret anything. You're still alive! I don't owe you anything anymore. They're all dead. Even Gido and the others. Don't worry. You're fully paid! What do you mean? I already sent my boys to your mom's house. Maybe, right at this moment, your siblings are dead. I told them to make your mom the last one to kill. Who is she? Poor girl. She'll be dragged into this. So you brought the kids with you. Thank you for that. I have to go to my family. I'll go with you. You know too little about being an abwak. What about the kids? This is your fault, Ate Hasmin. I will kill you all one by one. I will kill you all.
