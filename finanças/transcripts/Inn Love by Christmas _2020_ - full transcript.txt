- No, of course, Mr. Wilcox, I understand. And again, I apologize on behalf of Horton Hotels. I can personally assure you that this will never happen again. Well, I'm not supposed to do this, but because it's the holidays how about I offer you a massage to our spa and some vouchers for free room service for the rest of your stay. It's not a problem. Merry Christmas to you, too, Mr. Wilcox. Bye. - Wow, that's very generous of you, boss. You ready to take off? - Uh, yeah. Just-- Oh, just one second I have to get this. - Hello, is this thing on? - Hi, Gram, how are you doing? - Is it, Amanda, are you there? I can't see you. - Gram, hello? - Oh, there you are! Oh, there's my darling girl. - Now, I'm the one who can't see you. Tilt your tablet down. - Okay, all right. - Oh, split the difference. Almost there. - Ah! - There you go. How you doing, Gram? - Oh, you know, I'm just plugging along, counting the hours until my darling granddaughter comes home. - Me, too, Grams. I'm so happy I finally got some time off this year. Christmas just isn't the same when I'm in the city. - I'll bet. Now how'd you get your boss to let you come home this time? - Well, I am gonna have to work a little bit while I'm there, but it shouldn't take up too much time. - Oh, I'll just be so glad you're here. I don't care what you do. - Uh, [clearing throat]. - In fact, I can't wait to tell-- - Uh, just one moment, Gram, okay? Oh, yeah. Hey, Gram, I gotta go, but I'll see you soon, okay? - Yeah, okay, all right. I love you. - I love you, too. Bye. - Oh, I love you. Oh, you're coming home. - Wow, your grandmother seems like the sweetest person. - She's really special to me. Okay, I gotta drop these off on the way out. You ready? - Let's do it. - Let's go. Thanks. - This traffic is insane. These guys are treating it like a parking lot. It's a road! Any luck? - It looks like a fender bender up ahead. - Ugh, well it better clear up soon if we're gonna get you to, I'm sorry, what's the name of this place again? - Hollybush. - Hollybush, yes. That's right. Come on. Well, on the bright side I've checked you in, window seat. - Hm. - I printed you off a luggage tag in case you need it and we left 20 minutes early, so still if I was a betting man I'd say you'd get to the airport with enough time to get a chai latte in the lounge, your favorite. - I knew I hired you for a reason. - Yeah, well, I had a great resume, too, so. GinnyZee? - Yeah. - Look, if you need help with Ginny's account while you're gone I can handle it. - Oh, thank you, but you know I'm the only one she'll deal with. - That's ridiculous. It's sucky for you because you get no time off as it is. - Well, that's okay. - Look at this. Aha! - Yes! - See, I told you we'd get you to honeydew. - Hollybush. - Yeah, same thing. - Good luck, take care. Take a candy cane. Okay. Hello, welcome to-- - Hi. - Convenient Cars where the customer is always right. How can I help you? - I have a reservation for Amanda Leeds, L-E-E-D-S. - L-E-E-D-S. - Mm hm. - Hm, I'm not seeing it here. - Oh, that's weird. I, I have a confirmation number. Ah, here it is. - Okay. - 2539901 - Uh huh. Okay. Huh, that's weird. - What is it? - That reservation's already been checked out. - Really, by who? - By that guy over there. Um, sir, sir. Yeah, if you could just-- - Oh, I know him. - Oh, good, well, we'll get it all sorted out. Hi. - Hi. - Uh. - Leeds? Mandy Leeds? Okay, I haven't seen you in a long time. - Hi, Lucas. - Hi. I'm, what a coincidence running into you here. I mean honestly, I haven't seen you since what, high school grad, is that possible? - You might be right. - So, what's going on? You heading home for Christmas? - Well, I was hoping to, but it looks like you got my car reservation. - What? - Yeah, our system's been kind of wacky all day. I don't know how this could happen. I'm so sorry. - Oh, no, it's okay. It's not your fault. I'll just get another car. Right? - Yeah, yeah, um, just, just one moment. - Okay. - Just a few moments. - Oh, oh, okay. - I mean, I don't wanna overstep, but I could you a ride. I mean, technically it's your car. - No, no, no, I don't wanna impose. I'm just gonna get another car, it's fine. - Nah, don't be silly. Come on, two Hollybush High survivors, huh? Catching up on the road, could be fun. - Uh, no. - It'll save you like $400 and I'm going the same way. - You should take the ride. We don't have any cars left. - Oh. Okay, well, I guess I'm going with you then. - All right. - Okay. - Okay. - Great. - Thank you, take a candy cane. - Um, thank you. - Bye bye. - Heard any good jokes lately? - Not off the top of my head. - Really? - No. - I seem to remember you being like really funny. - I'm not not funny. - That was funny. I'm just saying, everyone's gotta have a go-to joke, right? Like in case of emergencies. Do you have an emergency joke? - I, okay, I did hear a joke recently, but it's like really bad. - Okay, like bad like cheesy or bad bad? - Oh like, it's a pun, so cheese city. - I love cheese, throw it out me. - I don't know. - No, you can't just dangle the carrot like that. Come on, let me hear it. - What do you call a fake noodle? An imposta! - Wow. - I know. - That was a really good bad joke. - I tried to warn you. - You did, you did, thank you. Maybe a better warning next time. What kinda music you listen to? - Uh, whatever. - This? - No. ♪ There's a place that-- - Oh, this is good. - Yeah, nice song. ♪ All the lights up on the street ♪ ♪ You're the only gift this Christmas I need ♪ - So, Leeds. - Hm? - Be honest. - Okay. - How come you didn't come to the high school reunion? - Um, I mean, I wanted to, but I was just busy with work and I couldn't get it off. Honestly, I'm still busy with work, but do you hang out with any of the old crew? - Nah, not really. I mean, Ashley from time to time. - Ashley Clayton? - Yeah. Yeah, that Ashley. Okay, I know you two didn't get along in high school, all right? But you were highly competitive. Not that you needed to be 'cause I mean what, you were good at everything. - Well, that's nice of you. I mean, I wasn't good at everything. - Oh, come on. Let's ring the old memory bell here, huh? - Okay, let's. - Yeah, ding, ding. - Mm hm. - Okay, so you beat me off for valedictorian. - Oh, I did. - Yeah, you were editor of the yearbook, huh? - Okay. - You remember that? - Yeah. - Head of the track team. - Oh, you have a good memory. - Yeah and you played Sandy in "Grease," you remember that? - Yeah, I do. Ooh, that was so fun. - You beat out like 50 girls. - Okay, well look who's talking. I mean, prom king, captain of the football team and you got voted class president. So. - That's true. - Mm hm. - That's true. You think we peaked in high school? - Definitely not. - Hey, are you hungry? - I'm starving. - Up ahead. - Hanks? - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh. They have the best french fries. - Yeah, they do. - We're going. - We're going. Oh, I haven't been here in a while. - Hey, welcome to Hank and Son's Diner. I'm Dave, let me know if you have any questions. Just grab any seat you like and I'll be right with you. - Thanks. - Thanks, Dave. - Thank you. - Nice hat. Think he works for Santa? - I heard that. Just kidding. - Oh, this is great. - Yep. Oh. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow, look at this. You see this mega mac and cheese? It's got two pounds of cheese in it. - That's a lot of cheese. - Oh, yeah, you know, people usually split that between three or four people, but if you can eat it all yourself it's free. Plus you get your picture up on that board. - Hm, I am hungry. - There's no way you're gonna eat that. - One mega mac, please. - All right, split? - Make it two, garcon. - Okay, two mega macs coming right up. - With extra cheese. - Whoa. - So, we're doing this? - Well, I mean it is a special occasion. Plus we get our picture up on that board. - Absolutely. So, how have you been? What are you doing? Are you in a relationship, are you seeing anyone? - Uh, I actually broke up with someone last month. - Oh, that sucks. - Mm hm. - Especially around the holidays. - Yeah, he thought that I was too focused on my career. I didn't even know that that was a thing. - Yeah, I know that feeling all too well. Mel and I, we just broke up about a year ago. - Mel and you? - Mm hm. - Mel, Prom Queen Mel? - Yes, Prom Queen Mel. - Interesting. What happened? - I mean, nothing really happened. - Hm. - We just, I don't know, we grew apart. I mean, we both changed but we didn't change together if that makes any sense. Plus you know, she wanted to stay in Manhattan and I didn't, so that was a big factor. - So, you wound up in New York? - Yeah, ended up being one of the Wall Street type guys if you can believe it. - Hm, you don't say. - So, what about you? I mean, what are you doing for work now? - Do you know Horton Hotels? - Yeah. - I'm a Regional Manager for three of their locations; two in Miami and one in Fort Lauderdale. - Wow. - Mm hm. - That's cool and you like it? - Oh, I love it. It's a great company and plus my boss let me have some actual time off this year, so I'm pretty happy about that. I mean, it does come with some strings attached, but. - What kinda strings? - Oh, well, you know that quant hotel off Highway Eight? It's kind of a mashup of a bed and breakfast and a motel. - Yeah, the Chesterwood, of course. - Right, well, it's up for sale and Horton Hotels is trying to get more boutique locations, so I tried to convince my managers to let me put a bid on it. Yeah. - So, what'd they say? - Oh, well, if I can close the deal by next week, then I am looking at a hefty raise and probably transferring to corporate office. - Wow. - I mean, it's not all about money for me. I just really wanna do a good job, you know what I'm saying? Sorry, do I make any sense? I feel like I'm really rambling. - No, it's fine, that's great. Wow, so, you're moving home? - Oh, no, well, no, not exactly. - Well, how's that work then? - Well, I can run the location remotely, just like I do for Fort Lauderdale. - All right, here you go. - Thank you. Oh, wow. - Hope you're not lactose intolerant. - We're gonna need a bigger fork. - Say cheese! - Cheese! - Cheese! - You know, I've never seen a couple take on this challenge at the same time. - Oh, no, we're not a couple. - Oh, we're not a couple. - Either way, you two make a great team. I hope to see you back here someday. Aw. - Thanks, Dave. - Oh, I got it, I got it. - Oh, you sure? - Yeah. So, thanks for the ride. - Anytime, Leeds. Hey, why don't I help you to the door. - Okay. - Amanda Leeds is that you? My, my, you have grown. And Lucas Manzino, twice in two weeks. Am I the luckiest gal in Hollybush or what? Manzino Junior here wants to buy the inn and I might just let him. - Well, I mean nothing's finalized yet. - Oh, no, but it's close to be final, wouldn't you say? When you were here last week you were ready to sign the check. - You know what, I do need to take this, so excuse me. - He's got some really fun ideas for the new menu. Very excited. - That's interesting. - Sorry to leave abruptly. I really do need to go. Tammy, we'll chat soon about the menu. Please let me explain this tomorrow. I'll call you? Great. - Okay, that was strange. So, young lady, what brings you into town? - Well, uh, I guess this is the best time to tell you, Lucas isn't the only one with his eye on the Chesterwood. That's what I'm doing here, I also wanna make a bid on it. - Oh. Okay. So, let me get this straight. You also wanna buy the inn? - Well, not me personally, but on behalf of Horton Hotels, yes. - Well, that puts me in quite a pickle to be honest with you. I mean, I'm very grateful to have two buyers interested, it's just, well, Lucas is moving back home and Bert and me, we just really want the person that takes over here to really care about the place. To run it like my family has for generations. - This is my home, too. And did you know that Horton Hotels is actually a family run business? I mean, it's a multimillion dollar family run business, but still, we know family. - I mean, I guess it wouldn't hurt to hear you out, but I should tell you this town relies on visitors and we haven't been getting many since that terrible blizzard last spring. I mean, we aren't the only people suffering from lack of tourism around here, businesses are closing up left, right and center. I tell ya, if we don't get more bookings for January, it won't matter who owns the inn, there won't be a town left to visit. - Oh, that's awful. - I know and Bert and me, we just don't have the heart for all the hustle and bustle anymore. So, we really need to find somebody who does. - Tammy, I completely understand what you need in a new owner and can confidently say that I wouldn't let you down. I have a ton of ideas for this place, and I can help this town. - Well, let's sit down over tea and chat this week. - Great. - Oh, oh, I guess I should check you in, huh? - Yeah. - Okay. - Hey, it's me. Are you around tomorrow at noon? Yeah? Okay, yes. - Ah, it feels like 80 years since the last time I saw you. Why didn't you call me sooner you dingdong? - I know, I'm the worst. But it was a last minute decision. - Whatever, I'm just happy you're here. When are you coming over for a movie marathon? - Uh, probably once the Christmas chaos dies down. - Or what are you doing tonight? - Ooh, I can't tonight. - Why not? - I'm going to dinner at my Gram's and then I have business to attend to. - Business huh? - Mm hm. - Yeah? - You heard of the Chesterwood? - You are aware that I live here, right? - Right, well, it went up for sale about a month ago. - I know, it's all anyone in this town can talk about. What about it? - Well, I'm putting a bid on it so that I can take it to corporate in New York City. - What? - Mm hm. - What about your job in Miami? - Oh, well, I love my job, I just need a new challenge. - Uh huh, so you're gonna buy the Chesterwood for your company and then what, move back home? - Oh, not really. Oh, but I will be home more. I mean, I'll be commuting from here and the city and just until the place gets in shape, so. What is it? - Well, obviously, I would freak out if you spent more time at home. - But? - But there's a teensy tiny rumor that Lucas Manzino is gonna put a bid on it. Apparently he's moving back home. - So I've heard. - And the entire town is rallying behind him because they say he's the voice of the new generation. - Hm. - Honestly, the guy could run for mayor and win just based on his charming smile. People really eat that up here. I'm sorry, Mans, I woulda sugarcoated the truth for you, but I love you too much. - It's not that I'm competing against him again, it's that I'm surprised that he didn't tell me himself. I mean, I had to find out from Tammy. - Hold up. I'm clearly missing something here. - Oh, we ran into each other on the way back into town. - And? - And it's a long story. And I have to get a dessert for tonight, so let's go. ♪ All of my wishes this Christmas ♪ - You're not getting off that easy. You know how much I love good gossip and I haven't had nearly enough, so, girl, you're on. - Well, the truth is he was different than I remember. - You are aware of how gossip works, right? You aren't giving me much to go on here. - I don't know, he was sweet. We bonded over mac and cheese. - Oh, Hank's mega mac? - Oh, that's the one! - Oh, that must've been a fun trip. Okay, let's get to the good stuff because if I know you there's something you're not telling me. - Is that little Amanda? - Hi, Jane. - Oh, it's so good to see you. How are you doing big city girl? - Good, good. - And the parents, how are they doing? - Oh, they're doing great. Soaking up the sun in Panama somewhere. - Ah, I can't wait to retire. And of course, hello, Jackie. - Hey, how's business been? - Oh, it's Christmas time. To be honest, we've had better years. Ooh-la-la. Grabbing something sweet for you and Mr. Leeds? - Oh, no, no time for Mr. Leeds. Just me. - Oh, well that's okay. Plenty of fish in the sea and everything happens for a reason, right? - Right. - When Mr. Right comes along, you'll make time I'm sure. - Yeah. - Look who it is. - Hi, Ashley. How are you? - I'm really great. Hey, Jackie. - Hi. - Hi, Jane. - I've been meaning to thank you for helping out with the food drive at the community center. - I do what I can. Everyone's gotta pitch in, right? So, are you home for the holidays? - Yeah, I'm here for Christmas with my Grams. - And she gets to spend time with me. - That's nice. Anyway, I'm just grabbing some chocolate chips 'cause I gotta finish up my holiday baking, so. - Oh, well, if I don't see you then I hope you have a merry Christmas. - Oh, I'm sure we'll see each other around. It's a really small town or have you forgotten? - Okay, bye. I don't love her. - I know. - So, just the fruitcake? - Yeah. - Okay. - You're here! Oh, look at you. Oh, sweetie. Oh, I finally get to hug my angel girl. Oh, my goodness. Oh, sweetie. Oh, and you brought dessert. You always were my favorite grandchild, you know that? - I'm your only grandchild. - Well, still. - Wow, Grams, you really went all out. - Yep. - I'm impressed. - Well, you know me. This is definitely my favorite time of year. Oh, this look so good. - Oh, good. There's actually a shop in the mall in my neighborhood and they have Christmas decorations all year round. It always makes me think of you. - Oh, sweetie. - How have you been? I miss you. - Oh and I miss you. And you know, I've just been puttering along. Yeah. - Well, you look pretty happy for someone who's just puttering along. - Really? - Mm hm. You're beaming. - Well, I do have a surprise to share with you my darling girl. - Oh? - Yes. Ah. - Who might that be? - That might be the surprise that I wanna share with you. - Oh. - Amanda, you remember Ernie Manzino. He's my boyfriend. - It's so good to see you again. - Ernie Manzino, how are you? I just ran into Lucas on the way here. What a small world. - Oh, great, then you're reacquainted again, 'cause he's gonna be along in just a minute. - What's that now? - Hello? - Hi. - Oh, hi. Hey, everyone. - Lucas, what are you doing here? - Oh, uh, well, my Gramps invited me over about an hour ago and I had nothing going on, so. - We thought it might be nice for you to have somebody your age to catch up with. - Well, that is really nice of you, Grams. I'm actually gonna head to the kitchen really quick-- - Uh, uh, uh, that's what Lucas and I are here for. We're gonna make you dinner while the two of you catch up with each other, okay? - Ooh! - Right, Luke? Come on, let's go. - Absolutely. - Thank you. Oh, Ernie, you. That's my boyfriend. - So, Ernie Manzino, huh? - Isn't he something? And wait till you try his turnips, they taste even better than mine do. - That's impossible. I wonder who told Ernie that my favorite food was mashed turnips? - Oh, I don't know, must've been a little birdy. - He seems nice, Grams. - Mm hm. - But just you know, be careful. - Be careful, what do you mean? - You know, boys. - Oh, hun, honey, don't worry about me. This isn't my first rodeo. Ooh, forks on the left. There you go, dear. - Oh. - And let me tell you something. When you know you just know, and someday soon you're gonna know. - Hm, I wouldn't hold my breath on that one, but if you're happy then I'm happy. - Dinner's ready, ladies. - Ooh, great. I hope everybody is very hungry. - Yes. I haven't had a home cooked meal in forever. - Aw. - Ooh, forever's a long time. - Oh, well, I've been busy. - So, Mandy-- - Mm hm? - Did you hear that the Chesterwood is for sale? - I sure did. So, how did you two meet? - Oh, my goodness. We love to tell this story, don't we? - You wanna start it off? - Okay. We reconnected at the Thanksgiving Day Parade. - And the weather for the day was beautiful, believe it or not. The sun was shining. - Mm hm. And with my fair skin I was afraid I was gonna get a sunburn, isn't that unbelievable? But anyway, did you know that Ernie does woodwork? - No. - Mandy, you should've seen it, it was like a giant birdhouse for a turkey. - It worked. - Well, after the parade I walked over to Eileen-- - And he said, "I wanted to come up with something clever "to say, but I thought I'd just wing it." I almost died laughing. - Okay, well, uh, I guess congratulations are in order for the love birds. - Oh. - Ooh, well, I mean, as long as there's no fowl play. - Ooh! - So, how did you two get reacquainted? - Um, what do you mean? - Well, you said that you reconnected on the way over here. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, well. - The airport was trying-- - Yeah. - To get Leeds, I mean Mandy's reservation at the car rental place at the airport and so, I got to give her a ride into town. - Well, that was awfully kind of you. - Well, I mean, they had my reservation but for some reason or another it got mixed up with Lucas's, so actually, he took my car. - Oh. - What a mix up. - Yeah, really. Well, it sounds to me like you two are meant to travel together. - Oh, yeah, I don't know about that. Those rental car places, their computers are really old. - Oh, come on, I think we had a pretty fun ride back, didn't we, Mandy? - Yeah, it was really fun. Um, Ernie, these turnips are amazing. You've got this like sweet and sour combo. What's your secret ingredient? - Oh, I'm glad you liked 'em. Lucas mixed up this batch, it's an old family recipe. - Mm. - Oh. They're, they're good. - Thank you. - Mm hm. - It's apple cider vinegar by the way. - Oh, is it? - Mm hm. - Interesting. - Uh, anyone want seconds? - Oh, I'll have some more turnips, Ernie, or should I say roomie? - Roomie? - Mm hm. - Huh? - Well, we wanted to wait until we could tell you in person. Ernie's moving in with me tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Wow. - Tomorrow? - Um, um. - Wow. - Well, that's big news. - Mm hm. - Yeah, uh, cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, yeah, right. Cheers. - Now, we know the two of you are incredibly busy young people, but we were hoping that you might be able to help us out with the move. - Would that be okay? I'm just not as strong as I used to be. - There's not a lot of stuff, but we sure could use the help. - Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, totally. Yeah, sure thing. - Yeah. - Oh, that's just wonderful then, thank you. - Ah, well, I am full. - Oh, thanks so much for having me over, Mrs. Leeds. - Oh, come on, you did all the work. Thank you and you can call me Eileen or even Grams if you like. - Okay. - Ah, well, this was a wonderful meal with wonderful company, too. - Are you all right, dear? - Oh, me, never my better, Grams. I'm just gonna take these dishes-- - Oh. - Because we have a big day tomorrow. - Oh, I'll help you. - Oh, no, that's not necessary, Lucas. You can just sit back and relax. - No. - I've got is. - No, I've cleaned dishes all through college and I know how to make 'em sparkle. - Okay, well, I can't argue-- - Huh? - With that, can I? - Well. - We get out of doing dishes. - Yes, we do. - I'll drink to that. - Good planning. Yep. - I shoulda told you I was gonna make a bid on the Chesterwood. - And why didn't you? - I don't know. I guess I just got distracted. I mean, I was having a lot of fun. And then when I found out that you wanted to make a bid on it too, I just felt bad. - Well, it felt worse hearing it from Tammy. - Yeah, no doubt. It's conflicting, you know? I mean, like, I really want this change of pace in my life and this is a great opportunity, but I don't wanna take anything away from you. And to be honest, I didn't wanna rain on your parade right then and there. - I get it. I mean, things get in the way. I just, I just wish you woulda said something. - I'm sorry. - No hard feelings. - So, friends on? - Friends. And by the way, about the Chesterwood, you haven't taken anything away from me yet. I'm still in the running. - Uh, yeah, I guess you're right. - Mm hm and just so you know, I have some stellar plans for that place. - Hm, well, as they say, may the best man win. - Or woman. - Hm. I should go get the rest of the dishes. - Yeah. Eye on the prize, Mandy. Eye on the prize. So, if you click that button there it automatically brings people to your new booking page. - That was so easy. - Mm hm. And if you click that it'll direct customers to your social media pages. Hm and that's weird. - Oh, it's actually not that weird. We don't have the social media. - Oh. Well, that explains it. I guess we'll have to get started on that, too. Good thing I brought my good camera. - Hm. - Ah, it's still lacking some flair. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go help my Grams today, but how about tomorrow I stop by and just spruce the place up? Nothing major, just a couple of tweaks to make it look a little more modern. - Well, as long as it's done by our annual Christmas Eve party. We're hosting it at the banquet hall this year and I don't wanna keep going back and forth. - Of course, I just need a few hours and it'll look good as new. Trust me. - Okay. So-- - Hello? Oh, hey. - Hey. - Hi. Oh, I'm sorry, don't let me interrupt ladies. - Oh, no, it's okay, hun. We're just gabbing about some much needed renos. - Yep. - Oh, really? - Mm hm. - Well, don't allow me to take up too much of your time. I just wanted to stop by and drop these off. - Oh, is that what I think it is? - You know it. - I just love biscotti. - Now, this would be the Chesterwood's signature cookie. Okay, we would serve it in every room with all the espresso machines. And this is what I'm working on for the proposed menu. - Wow, look at you, this is fancy. Let me just go put this in the kitchen. - You know how they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? - Hm. - Well, I have found that to be true for everyone, not just us guys. - Gotta hand it to you, Luke, you're a strong competitor. I mean, don't get me wrong, you're still gonna lose, but I do admire your tenacity. - Ditto. Are you ready for this move? - Uh, yeah, I'm in my comfy clothes and everything. - Yeah you are. - So nice to see you two are in better spirits today. - I forget how peaceful it is here. So quiet. - Yeah. That's why I left the city. - Hm. - I'm gonna warm up the car. - Okay. - Oh, come on. - What? - I don't know, maybe the block heater's too cold? Might have to wait till morning when it warms up. - Okay. - Guess we're spending the night. - Well, Ernie's cabin it is. What are we gonna do about food? We packed up all the cans. - Ah, you know what we didn't pack, the fridge. - Mm. - Huh. - So, mustard and pickle sandwiches? - I'm in. Why don't you have a seat, I'll handle this. - Okay. - All right. - So, what made you wanna purchase the Chesterwood? - Well, my family has always been in the service industry and I think I'm finally understanding why. I mean, the day-to-day can be quite simple, however, you can make someone smile just by making 'em a pickle sandwich. Plus just that whole Manhattan fast paced lifestyle, I think I'm over it. - You don't think that you'll miss it? - Yeah, maybe. I just wanna spend more time with friends and family. - Hm. - All right, one sandwich coming right up. - You know, I admire that. For me I'm just trying to build my career. Cheers. - Cheers. To being stuck together yet again. - Yeah. It's actually really good. - Thank you. So, how about you? I mean, what got you into the hotel game? - I just think there's something really rewarding about going the extra mile to make someone happy or making them feel special on their vacation. I'm really in my element when I'm working and I just wanna be the best that I can be. - Well, you don't have to tell me that. - Okay, I know, I'm competitive. But I don't know, I feel like I have something to prove to myself. - I get that. You wanna know something? I like spending time with you. - Oh, sorry, it's work. - You should try turning that off sometime, you might like it. - Well, it's just this one client. She kinda counts on me to be there. - That sounds time consuming. - I mean, not really. It used to be, but now that I've figured out what she likes and what she doesn't like, it's pretty easy. Plus we've kinda become friends. - That's nice. Well, I guess we should tuck in, huh? Get a good sleep so we can move everything in the morning. - Yeah, okay. - I'll show you to your room. - Thanks. - Here you are, my lady. Good night. - Night. ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ And all is bright ♪ 'Round yon virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ Silent night ♪ Oh, holy night ♪ All is calm and all is bright ♪ 'Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild - Hey. - Hey. - How'd you sleep? - Ah, pretty good, you? - Not bad. That bed is surprisingly comfortable. - Yeah. You all right? Hey, hey, what are you doing? Uh uh, you don't wanna do that. That's it. This is so on right now. Okay. Oh, nice! You ready for my specialty? Okay, I call this the big thunder. - Where'd you go? Do you give up? - Oh! - I surrender, I surrender. - For real? - Yes. - Turn around. I tried to warn you. - Uh, great, well, in my defense I didn't know that I was up against some sort of snowball olympian. - Yeah, three time gold medalist winner. - Uh huh. - Uh huh. - Yes! - Uh. Oh, no. - What is it? - They moved my flight to the 28th. - That's not a bad thing. Now you get to spend more time at home. - Ugh, I have a big meeting with my boss on the 27th. I'm supposed to debrief her on all of the progress I've made with the Chesterwood. - All right. - What's wrong? - Honestly? I mean, you haven't been home in over a decade and you wanna go home the day after Christmas. I just don't get it. - I mean, I don't want to go home. - You're not trying very hard to stay. - Luke. - Look, I mean it's one thing to care about your job, it's another to make it your life. Trust me. - I don't know what to say, Luke. I have to get back to work. I can't stay here forever. - Fine. Yeah, we'll get you back. - I was supposed to only be here for a week and then back to my life in Miami and now I don't know what to do. - Oh, I know, it's so stressful when they change your flight around. - Right? And I have meetings to get back to and my apartment and the sunshine. - Well, on the bright side, those things will all be there when you get back. - That's true. And I'm a little worried about the Chesterwood. I mean, I really, really want it, and how am I supposed to make biscotti? And when would I learn to make biscotti? And who even likes biscotti? All it is is a sweet cracker. - Biscotti? Is this about Lucas? - Okay, yes. He said there's caring about your work and then making it your life. And then we didn't talk on the drive home. - Yikes, that must've been an awkward ride back. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm so sorry, Mans. - It's okay. I actually need to focus on the inn anyways, so. - It's okay to be upset about it. - I'm not upset about it. Okay, I'm a little upset about it. - Okay, take a long, deep breath. And let's talk about how we're gonna turn this day around. - To be honest, I think I need to be distracted. Are you free this afternoon? - Girl, you know I'm always free as a bird for you. What do you have in mind? Self care day. We can get manipedis. - Oh, that sounds amazing, but I did promise Tammy that I would help her with a few touches back at the inn. I would be so grateful if you could join me. - Um, it's not quite as relaxing as a spa day, but if it helps you get one step closer to closing the deal with the O'Connors, I'll be there. - You're the best, Jacks, I can always count on you. Ooh, I'm late. Okay, I'll call you later. - Mm hm. - Ooh, wear comfy clothes. - Mm hm. The spa would've been really nice. - We're on the east coast, it's the same timezone. - Oh, so, I'm sorry, is now not a good time? - Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah, totally. Everything's completely under control. Actually, um, can I put you on hold for just one second? Yeah? Oh, yes, okay, can I deal with that in like five minutes? Okay, I'm back. - Level with me, Greg. - It's room 203. The guest is complaining that it's somehow too hot and too cold at the same time. I honestly don't know how you do it. I've tried everything. - Okay, how bad is it? - Well, it's pretty bad. I would say that the guest is irate. Um, I could really use your help in fixing it. - I can't. - Um, I'm sorry, can't? - Fix it. - Oh. - You don't need me, you're a great people person. I know you can handle it. - Um, um, thank you, but-- - Have you spoken to her? - Uh, yes, a number of times. - In person? - No. - What do you think, patterned or textured wallpaper? - Um-- - It's for the inn. I'm helping the owner with a few small renovations. - Okay, yes, how old's the building? - Uh, 1870s Victorian. - Textured. You can never go wrong with a classic. - Great. - So, the guest, any advice? - Bottom drawer, left-hand side, knock on the door. Go with the classics. - Go with the classics. - I'll tell you the truth. My main concern is that Lucas is local and he cares about this town and this town cares about him. And Horton Hotels is a big company. I'm just not sure this place will get the same attention and care, you know? - I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me start by keeping my promise from yesterday. A few simple fixes. I mean, why wait, right? - All right. I don't see the harm in getting some help anyway. - Okay. Let me just make a couple phone calls first. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for coming. - Oh yeah. - Of course. - Okay. - Okay, yeah, no, I got perfect stuff. ♪ Ooh ♪ Hurry home and come 'round here ♪ ♪ I really love this time of year ♪ ♪ Making plans to get together ♪ Memories that will last forever ♪ ♪ Sharing laughter and sharing joy ♪ ♪ Everyone is singing, all the girls and boys ♪ ♪ Some kinda magic is in the air ♪ To make a special moment we can share ♪ ♪ It's always falling deep outside ♪ ♪ The day is almost up ♪ Come inside and don't be shy ♪ 'Cause now is time to have some fun ♪ ♪ Christmas ♪ Ah, it's Christmas ♪ And I wanna share this moment with you ♪ ♪ Christmas ♪ Ah, it's Christmas ♪ And I wanna share this moment ♪ With you - When you're right, you're right. This place looks 10 times better than it did yesterday. And even better than it did on its best days. Thank you so much, Mandy, for your help, we needed it. - Well, this is just the beginning. I mean, imagine what we can do with some deeper pockets. - Ah, well, I will give that some thought. I promise you that, but in the meantime, I've gotta go check on Bert. He's getting a very nasty cold, but I'll be back in a few minutes. - Okay. - Hello? Oh, hi. Hey. - Hi. - Whoa, this place looks amazing. Did you, did you do this? - Well, I mean, not alone. I had some help. - Mm hm. - Mm hm. - Three amigos, huh? I mean, it looks really good. I mean, it's not too much, it's not too little. Whoa. - Yeah, I should go. I could use a shower. - Mm hm. - Right and I've gotta pick Ernie up from curling, so. - Oh. - Mm hm. - Bye. Guess I know how to clear a room, huh? I'm sorry about what I said earlier. You care about your work and that's a good thing. I had no right to pass any judgment on that. To be honest, Leeds, I mean that was me. I never took a lunch break, never took a vacation, and I got burnt out, like hard. So, I just want what's best for you if that makes any sense. - Well, for what it's worth I'm sorry, too. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in work I don't realize how glued to my phone I am. - Oh, great, great, you're here early. I was wondering if we could go over a few things on the menu you gave me. - Yeah, absolutely. - Excellent. - Okay, well, I'll just leave you to it. - I mean, unless you wanna stay? - Are you sure that's okay? I mean, just so I can check out what the competition is up to. - Yeah, we would appreciate the input. - Great. - Great. - Great. so, my first question is will my cook be able to make everything on this menu? He's not the brightest bulb in the pack. - Yeah, I have the recipes printed off, so I think he'll be okay. But if he needs help I'll come and teach him. - Can I take a look. - Yeah, absolutely, I mean most of them are from family recipes, but you know, I got creative with a few. - Hm. Chicken Cordon Blue. - Mm hm. - Oysters Rockefeller, these are good. These are like really good. - Really? - Mm hm. - So even this, this turnip, how do you say that word? - Tartine, it's French. - Uh huh, Tartine? 'Cause you know, turnips can be hit or miss with people sometimes. - Oh, turnips are a hit with me. - Really? - Yeah. - All right, well, you know what, if this is how people are eating nowadays, I'm all for it. But could you do me a favor? - Hm? - Could you put a couple of classics on the menu? I'm thinking something like a pot roast, fried chicken. - Deal, absolutely, done. - Great, well, I think it looks good then. Now, it is no secret that you both really want this property and Bert and me, we're thrilled about your interest. And from what I've seen from both of you is that either one of you would be a great choice to run this place. We just have a lot to consider before we make our final decision. - I'm sure I could put a good word in, see if I could get the secret family recipe for our spaghetti sauce. - The Manzino marinara? - Yeah, you know it. - Well, I can make a single phone call and get you a higher number for this place. - While I appreciate those sentiments, I should let you know that it's about more than just menu or money. Bert and me, we built this place and you know, we just really wanna make sure it's looked after with the same amount of heart that we gave it. And you guys both have heart, that's for sure. We just, we just need just another day to make our final decision. - I completely understand. - Thank you. I promise I will let you know tomorrow at the Christmas Eve soiree. Hm, see you're not the only one who can speak French around here. - Sounds fair, Tammy. - Okay, so, having said that in the meantime I've gotta go get prepared for said soiree, so if you'll excuse me. - Okay, see you tomorrow. - Later, Tam. - Bye, guys, thanks for your work. - Oh, yeah, speaking of work. We still have some moving boxes to unpack at your Grams if I'm not mistaken. If you still want help. - Wouldn't mind an extra hand. - I'll bring 'em both. So, Leeds, you like my menu? - Yeah, smooth move with that secret recipe. Must be some spaghetti sauce. - Gotta hand it to you though, huh? Coming in with the higher bid. - Hm. - Hm. - Not my first rodeo. Ooh. - You all right? - I cut myself. - Really? - Ooh, yeah, it's bleeding. - Ooh. - I'm gonna go sit down. - Uh, where does your grandma keep the first aid kit? - Uh, top shelf in the cabinet on the right. - Oh, I found it. I found it. Unit one, we got a cut. We're coming in hot. Okay. Hey, eyes right here. - Okay. - Follow my finger. Eyes here. - I see you. It's not bleeding that bad. - No, no, don't look at it, just focus. All right, knock knock? - Who's there? - Boo. - I've heard this one. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - Boo. - Boo who? - Oh, hey, it's okay, you don't have to cry about it. Just a little cut, see? Everyone's gotta have a go-to joke. - In case of emergencies. - That's right. Just like this. Look at that emergency. How's that? - It's great. - Mm hm. - Yeah, all better. Uh, thank you. - Nice to be home. - Yeah, I hear you. - Guess I should go. - Yeah. - I'll see you at the party? - Yeah, you were funny. - Of course. - Oh, wow, I can't believe how much stuff they brought in. Hey, Mandy, Lucas, where are you? - Hey, Gramps, Eileen. - Oh, well, thanks for all this, kiddo. We owe you one. - Not a problem. - Thanks. - Ah, you two look good together. - Oh, [giggling], good night. Thanks again. - Thank you, good night. - Hi. - You guys held hands? What is this, middle school? - Okay, well, when you put it that way it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it was cute. - Oh, no, trust me, this is a big deal. I'm still trying to recover from the fact that you guys are even on speaking terms and now you're gonna get married and have babies. - Okay, whoa, you've missed a couple of steps. I mean, we haven't even kissed yet. - Yeah, but you almost did, which means it's only a matter of time before [humming]. And no pressure, but just saying your babies would be so cute. - Oh, oh, no pressure, huh? - No. Are you sure you wanna stick around? I don't need my cappuccino that bad. - No, it's fine. - Look who it is. - Oh. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Look at us all together again. - What are you up to? - Uh, we were actually just about to go get ready for Tammy's Christmas Eve party. How about you? - We're keeping busy. - Ash, you're still Christmas shopping? - I'm almost done. It's been so tough for Main Street this year, so I'm doing all my shopping locally. And speaking of locally, Amanda, I hear that you're also bidding on the Chesterwood? - Yeah, I'm just gonna order something really quick. You want something or? - Oh, I would love a coffee. Thanks, Luke. - That's looks delicious. - So, the inn? - Uh, yeah. I mean, it's a great opportunity and I feel like we can really revive the business. - Hey, Lucas, what can I get for you? - Hey, I'll grab one coffee and one capachino. - Of course. - Thank you. - Well, this town really needs the hotel to work, but I just feel like Lucas knows Hollybush so well, you know? - What'd I miss? - Oh, we were just discussing how both you and Amanda are bidding on the Chesterwood. - That comes up a lot, huh? - Yeah. - Well, I personally don't think it's gonna be much of a competition. I mean 99% of Hollybush is rallying for you to win, and come on, we all know how much Tammy cares about what the people think, so. - I don't know, Ash. I mean, you should see what Leeds has been doing over there. It's quite impressive. - Well, this might sound harsh, but I just don't think she's as good as you, Luke. - I'm actually really good at my job. - Yeah. - Well, this has been fun, but Mans and I have to go get ready for the party. - Yep. - Okay, see you there. - Really? - What? - Okay, she is as bad as I remember. Let's not worry about her. We have a party to get ready for. - Mm hm. - Hey. - Hey. - Yeah, I'm gonna go grab, go grab my, whatever, I'll see you in the car. - Okay. - I meant what I said at the table. I think you're doing a great job with the inn. - I appreciate it. - I mean, I've had all these visions for it and you just keep bringing new ideas. - You just like the competition, don't ya? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. But I mean if I'm gonna lose, might as well lose to you, right? - Hm. I'll see you tonight? - Yeah. Let me get that. - Oh. Thanks. - You know, Jacks, you're seriously the only person in this world I trust enough to do this. - Well, that's because I'm amazing at it. - Mm hm. - And because that salon lady really overdid your prom makeup. That's when I got why you couldn't trust anyone to do anything for you. - Oh, no, okay, I think that is a bit of an exaggeration. - What, no, no, no. It's not a bad thing, okay? Some people just need to work a little extra to earn your trust. It's who you are and I love every bit of you. - Have I told you how awesome you are? - No, but if you lived here you could tell me everyday. - I know, true. - No, seriously though, I miss you. And call me crazy, but you seem pretty happy ever since you've been back. - It has been nice being home. I love seeing Gram so happy and I have a really good feeling about the Chesterwood, so. - I think you're forgetting something or shall I say someone off the list. - Yeah, Lucas? Things have been pretty great with us, even if he is friends with she who shall not be named. - No, dingdong, I'm talking about me! I make you happy! - I was saving the best for last. - Uh huh. - I was. - Okay, are you ready to head over and impress everyone with our sweet dance moves? - Absolutely. - Mm hm. - Let's do this. - Well, it's just been so nice of you guys to come. You know, every year at Christmas we do this. - You got this. I'll see you in there. - Wish me luck. Excuse me, Tammy. - Okay, I'll see you guys up there. Okay, Merry Christmas. Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't too forward when I was talking about a higher bid, I-- - Oh. - I want you to know it's not all about money for me either and I care about the inn. - It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. You know, I've been thinking about this situation a lot and you know and if I really went with my gut-- - Yeah. - I think I would, ooh, oh, those look scrumptious. - Oh, hi, yeah, I was just gonna run those upstairs. - Oh, no, that's okay.

I mean, she got really upset with me when I moved to New York. Probably didn't forgive me until I decided to move back. And again, I know this doesn't explain everything, but like many people here, they're just really protective on this town and the people in it. - I get it. It's just she can be a little frosty. - That's a good way to put it. Plus you know, I mean, she thinks that I like you and stuff. - Oh, yeah?

Gonna see you around here more often? - What makes you think I'm gonna get the inn? Your biscotti's pretty convincing. - Just a gut feeling. - Well, if I do get the inn then yeah, I'll be here for weeks at a time. - Hm. - What? - Nothing, will just be good to see you around here more. - Yeah? - Yeah, you know, maybe I'll ask you out sometime. - Maybe you should. ♪ But you always knew - There you go, I told you that would look sharp on ya.

You sure know how to throw a party. - Oh, well, I couldn't have done it without you. I wanted to thank both of you for everything. I mean, with your decorating skills and your cooking skills you'd make a heck of a great team. Just something to think about. Bert and me, we finally had a chance to sit down and chat about who should get the inn. And so, we've decided-- - Hello, everybody. - Oh, Merry Christmas, Ashley. - Enjoying the party, are we? Perhaps a little too much even. - I'm glad you make it, Miss Clayton. - Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world. Oh, Mrs. O'Connor, have you gotten a chance to say goodbye to Amanda yet? - What, what do you mean? - Amanda Leeds is not here to stay. She's going back to Miami after the holidays. - Well, of course she would wanna go back and get her things before she moved back home. Of course she would. - Oh, no, no, you're misunderstanding me. Amanda does not intend to stay here even if you sell the Chesterwood to her. That's right. She plans to buy the hotel and then leave Hollybush again. I guess she thinks she's too good for us. - I wanted to speak to you privately about this, but now that everyone is listening. I was planning on designating a team to this specific project, but it was just because I have to go back to Miami and I can't really do both. And so, I don't, and-- - No, no, no, now, now, now, now, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Now, now, now, now. I am gonna speak to Miss Leeds privately. Everyone just enjoy the party. Go on, enjoy the party. Bert, make more punch. - Yes, dear. - Well. - Tammy, I swear, I was planning on giving you a full run through before I assigned a team. Plus I'd be only a couple hours away because I'd be transferring to the Manhattan office, so that I could be here constantly while we got things up and running. - And I really wish it had happened that way, privately. But what happened in there doesn't look good on you, hun. It certainly doesn't look good on me and Bert. I don't know how we could sell you hotel right now, 'cause the town would riot. They need a familiar face in there. - I'm so sorry. - I... Me, too. I really didn't want it to work out like this. - Come on, Mans, please don't go. - I was just so close. - Honey, you should be very, very proud of yourself. - Yeah, you would've gotten it if it wasn't for that vixen. - She's a troubled one that's for sure. - I'm not even mad at Ashley. I mean, I expected it from her, but Lucas? I mean-- - Are you 100% sure that he's the one that told her that you weren't staying for good? - I don't know. - Yeah, it's just weird. He tried to run after you when Tammy pulled you aside, and when I cornered he said he had no idea how she found out. I don't know, it seemed like he was telling the truth. - Well, how else would she have found out? - I dunno. - Well, why don't you stay at my house tonight and you'll wake up with family Christmas morning, okay? - Okay, fine. I'll stay, but just for tonight. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna try to find a train outta here. But you know what we should do? We should watch a Christmas movie. - Absolutely. - Oh. Okay, I have an idea. - What is it? - Scratch the movie. This party's just getting started. foreign language] - Hello, everybody. My girl has something to say. - Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. I know a lot of you are upset with me right now, and I don't blame you. Um, I shoulda told Tammy about my plan from the beginning instead of all of you finding out at once. And for that, I am truly, genuinely sorry. I am formally withdrawing my offer to purchase the Chesterwood. And something that I don't want spreading is that I don't care about this town or the people in it because I do. This is my home. And just because I moved away doesn't mean that I forgot where I came from. I'm a small town girl at heart. And if there's one thing you need to know about small town girls is that they're the most loyal people you'll ever meet. So, now, I have a question for you all.

Seriously, how could you have possibly gotten cooler since high school? - Well, I obviously learned it from you. - Oh, well, that totally makes sense. But let's talk about Gram's dancing. - Oh, my gosh. - What was that? - Amazing, she's so cute. - Did you see that robot thing she did? - Oh, my gosh. - I think she was trying to one-up. - Absolutely, she definitely. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Grams. - Oh, honey. I hope you still like blueberry. - Ah, you know I do. - Great. - Is Ernie here? - Oh, no, not quite. Um, he uh-- - What's going on, Grams? - Nothing that I know of. Uh, he, um, Ernie, um. Would you, do you want some juice? - No thank you. - Coffee? Okay. - Merry Christmas, kiddo. - Merry Christmas, Ernie. - Okay, so don't be mad at him, be mad at me. - I could never be mad at you, Grams. What's Lucas doing here? - Well, I asked Ernie to pick him up. Lucas did not tell Ashley that you're going back to the city. I did. - What? - Well, not directly, but I played bridge with her grandmother and I was talking about how wonderful it was to have you here and how much I was gonna miss you when you were gone. Oh, boy, I didn't connect the dots until early this morning. I just feel terrible that I said anything and I'm so sorry if I jeopardized your career. - It's okay, you didn't do it on purpose. And honestly, I should've been upfront with Tammy from the beginning. That's my fault. - Lucas, would you like to stay for breakfast? - Could be fun. - I'd love to. Yeah, thank you. - Great, well, I better just get cooking. - And I'll help you. - Hi. - Hey. How are you doing? - I'm okay. I'm really happy for you. You're an amazing chef. You're gonna knock it outta the park. I wouldn't wanna deprive Hollybush of that. - Yeah, about that. I, I may have dropped out of the running and told Tammy that I think you'd be a better fit for the Chesterwood. - Why, you've worked so hard for this, too. - 'Cause I want what's best for this town and I think you're it. I actually told Tammy yesterday morning before the party, which is why I think she was so rattled because she suddenly went from two buyers to zero. - I can't believe you did that for me. I mean, isn't Tammy and slash pretty much all of Hollybush still upset with me for leaving? - Well, your friend actually made quite the impression. I mean, she started geo-tagging all her posts, started hyping the town, hyping the inn, I mean the bookings started coming in like hotcakes. Look, the inn's completely booked till after Valentines Day. - Really? - Yeah. And Tammy, man, I've never seen Tammy so happy before. - That's amazing. - That's you. But listen, Tammy wants to tell you rest herself, but I can assure you the inn is yours if you still want it. - I'm getting the inn? - You're getting the inn. And you knew when were dancing? - Yeah, yeah, maybe less of a gut feeling and more a secret surprise I guess. - I just wanna say-- - Why don't-- Get-- - No, I think-- - Time out. - Stop. - You go first. - I just wanted to say thank you for talking to Tammy. She values what you have to say. - Well, honestly, all I did was help Tammy realize what she already knew. That you're the best fit for the Chesterwood. I mean, hands down, no question. Right, you did the work and you showed that you cared. - Well, there was one thing I wanted to run by you. I was planning on talking to you about it if I got the Chesterwood. It's just an offer and see if you like it. - Okay? - I can handle the day-to-day operations. I'll be back and forth from New York City. - New York City? - Mm hm. That's where corporate is. Just a couple hours away and I'll be transferring there once the deal goes through. - So, I'll be seeing a lot more of you then, huh? - Mm hm. Well, that's what I wanted to ask you. I mean, we'll need a head chef for the restaurant. I mean, if you know anyone interested. - Um, you know, maybe, maybe. I mean, is there dental? Are you serious? - Yes. - Wow, no, thank you. That's incredible. You're incredible. - So, what did you wanna ask me? - Really just wondering when you're heading down south again, 'cause I'm assuming you gotta pack, right? To move to New York City. - Well, I was thinking of staying here through New Years. I pushed that big meeting with my boss. - Hm, that's interesting. - What's interesting? - No, just maybe we can hang out a bit more now? After all, if I'm gonna be your head chef, I mean, you're gonna have to approve everything on the menu. - Absolutely. - Right, there's gonna be a lotta taste testing. - Lots of taste testing. - And probably some one-on-one cooking lessons. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Maybe? - You really do know a way to a girl's heart. - It's biscotti. There's just one more thing. - Yeah? - So, after that I just said I'll see ya later. - Ah, well, Merry Christmas, everybody. - Merry Christmas. - Let's eat. - Merry Christmas. - Yes. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Oh. - Here's the plate. ♪ Merry Christmas to you ♪ The only present I need ♪ Under the mistletoe ♪ There's no place that I'd rather be ♪ ♪ The fire burning nice and slow ♪ All the lights up on the tree ♪ You're the only gift this Christmas I need ♪ ♪ If I haven't told you how my only wish this year ♪ ♪ Oh, it doesn't cost a penny ♪ Or get delivered by Santa or reindeer ♪ ♪ Oh, no ♪ You're the only gift this Christmas that I need ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh Merry Christmas.
