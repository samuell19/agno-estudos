Have I ever even seen you swim? Berman, nobody swims in these things. They're for floating. You fill them with plastic inflatables and you free-associate. The gentle swaying, it stimulates the brainpan, you know? Why not start with a hammock and then work your way up? Well sometimes I'm out here and I got to take a leak. The weather's nice. I want to stay out but I got to pee, I mean, just for that the pool's worth the investment. Rufus: Thank you. See you soon. Where's the girl? With her mother. Thought she hated her mother. She does. So what are you doing here? Go and-go and liberate her. It's forbidden. Dude you're sixteen, everything's forbidden. I mean the world expects you to disobey. I've been accused of unnatural acts.
