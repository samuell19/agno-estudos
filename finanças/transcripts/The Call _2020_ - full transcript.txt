Dammit! First day. What'd you do? Excuse me. What are you seeing the principal for? Vandalism? Smoking pot in the boys room? Bring a weapon to school? What? No, it's personal. Ooh, personal. Wait. You're the new kid, aren't ya? Busted. Tonya Michaels? Consider me the welcoming committee. Follow me. So what brings you to Willow Falls? Kinda late in the year, don't you think? Well, my parents split. My mom's a nurse and this is the only place that she could find work. Meaning what? Huh? What are you implying? This place is just some shit hole? - No, no, I... - Not good enough for you? I didn't mean that it was some shit hole. Relax. I'm just fucking with ya. Welcome, new fish. You got some major balls coming to this town. Most of us just wanna get the hell out. Yeah, why is that? It's a pleasure being your tour guide. Before I forget. Mr. Mitchell. We pride ourselves on punctuality at this school. Ain't that right, Ms. Michaels? I was just showing him the way. That's sweet of you. Class. Now. Look, I know why you called me down here. Maybe we should talk about this in private. There's not really much to talk about. I talked to your principal at your old school about what happened. Past is the past. And sir, I'd really appreciate if we could keep it there. I hear you. Let's talk about it anyway. After you. Nice office. Damn! Hey, honey. I didn't know you would be home. My shift ends at 10. Oh! Yeah. Right. How was your first shift? It was okay. Listen, I really need to get some sleep. Can you and Patrick- - TJ! He works at the bank. He took me to Dairy Queen. He's a really, really nice guy. You're really gonna like him. Can you do me a favor, hun? When you meet him, could you call him, dad? Okay. Goodnight. Night. Swing the hammer. Challenge the strong man. Swing the hammer. Pussies. Challenge the strong man. Swing the hammer. Three in a row is a winner. Okay. Okay. Bon Jovi, that's enough. Come on over, that's enough. You're not a winner? You're a loser. Take off. So what are your friends? Carnies? Funny. Let me guess. In your old town, you and your friends got drunk in the McDonald's parking lot and did wheelies. Top that, bitches. What's up, babe? I was wondering when you'd get here. Fuck off. I decided to drag the new kid out to have some fun with us. This is Chris Mitchell. Tonya does love her strays. This is Zack. He seems like a big jerk, but then you find out, he is. You used to love jerking it. Now you jerk yourself. Shut up. You look like a laffy taffy in that, you know that? What is it? A buck a piece? Yes, sir. Buck a piece. Three in a row, big time winner. Today, please. You got this. How about you, tough guy? Number three? - Jeez! - Mr. Chuckles here is Brett. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. Cotton candy? Nah, I'm good. You know it. - Let's go. - Cotton candy? Yeah. See you after the carnival. Come. Come, my friend. Come inside. Come inside. What do you want, man? What are your future, my friend. Sit down. I'm not paying you. It's free. Yes. Your hand. Yes. There's a man from your past. You need to reconnect with him. What are you talking about? You will have a long and prosperous life, my friend. Get off me, you freak? What's the hold up? You want some? Yeah, I didn't think so. The way you're drinking that beer, like a pussy? All right, hand it over. We should do a toast to Laura. Bro. Dick move. What? Who's Laura? Tonya's little sister. Oh, you never mentioned you have a sister. Had a sister. What happened? She went missing. Missing. We all know what happened. Edith Cranston got to her. What? She used to run this daycare center. One day Laura was there and then no one ever saw her again. Look, I don't want to talk about that. It's okay, babe. It's not okay. It's never gonna be okay. Look, we can't get her to confess, but we can make that old hag suffer. Oh yeah. I'm feelin' it. I think it's time we pay her another visit. Where are we going? It's an old tradition. You'll see. All right, Mr. Chuckles. So, fill me in on this little tradition. You'll see. We're going to Cranston's. Cranston's? Why? We like to remind her what kinda monster she is. Yeah? We flooded her basement, cut her tires. One time we left flaming shit on her porch, which is classic. And you know, she really is a monster. - She's a witch. - Bro. She is. Everyone knows it. Your sister. What happened? We don't know for sure. That's the hard part. On her birthday, she was at Cranston's daycare and she just never came home. The police questioned Cranston. They shut down her daycare completely, but they never found Laura's body. And that rich bitch, she hired a fancy lawyer and just got away with it. I'm sorry. Me too. The police forgot about Laura. But we never did, and we won't let her either. For Laura. For Laura. For Laura. I'm sorry. Pussy. Move your ass. Oh, shit. Going somewhere? Yeah. So get the hell out of our way. This is my property, and you are trespassing. You're lucky my husband is not here. He would shoot you right where you stand. And there's a little more blood on your hands. I am not going to be run out of my own home. You can shatter my windows and I will replace them. You can throw a dead animal and I will bury it. You can slash my tires, I will get new ones. But I'm staying right here. You wanna know why? Do you wanna know why? Because as much as you hate me, I hate you more. I hate you more. I hate you more. Then leave, 'cause we're never gonna stop. Not until you leave or die. I'm not afraid of you, but you, you should be very, very afraid of me. Where did you get that necklace, Tonya? See you in hell, you old woman. Yes, you will. And I'm gonna save you a seat. Now, get out. Oh my God. Penny for your thoughts. A penny. That's it? A kiss then. I'm trying to remember the adventures we had. The hopes, dreams, the children. But it's all gone. Edith, what are you... There's only darkness. Look at me. My dream was to be with you forever. And I am. So I'm happy as a clam. Good. Are you okay, Chris? I'm fine, ma. You don't seem like yourself. Are you sure everything's okay? You know, if you need to talk to someone, I'm here. Hey. Hey, you. I got your call. Haven't seen you at school the last few days. I got worried. You got worried. Actually I was a little worried. Are you okay? Not really. You do feel a little hot. Is this about Cranston? We were there the night she... - What if... - What if what? I don't know, man. What if she had a heart attack? - What if we were the reason? - We didn't do anything. And if anybody asks, you keep your mouth shut. Or what? You're gonna throw a rock at me? You think you're such a badass? Well, I'm not some little old lady you can just push around. I'm not afraid of you. Maybe you should be. Maybe you should come up with a better line. Relax. Relax. You're both pretty. Hey. You're a good guy. I like that about you. You're sweet. She's gone. And the world is a better place for it. Yeah, she was into some dark stuff. I'm telling you, man. She was a witch. What? You saw how she was that night. Acting all crazy. Fucking witch. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And we can't change that. And we, we're alive. We've got our whole lives ahead of us. So we should just bury the past and enjoy it. Hey, are we good? Yeah. I guess. Then say it. Tell me we're good. Yeah, we're good. We're good. Hey, you wanna play Pac-Man? I wanna play Pac-Man. Hello. Hello, Christopher. Come with me. Hold on. We're not going anywhere with you until you tell us why we're here. Patience is a virtue. We're not exactly the virtuous type, old man. Have a seat. Tonya. Zack. Brett. And Chris. You must be new. Doesn't matter. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. I'm sure you're heartbroken. And I know you all are because whose house are you gonna terrorize now? Look, we don't want any trouble. No one wants trouble. Sometimes it just finds them. Look, enough with the small talk. What do you want? Tonya, Tonya. If I got what I wanted, Tonya, this meeting would be a whole lot less civil. Edith was different. She was more forgiving. So it seems like she surprised everyone when she included you in her will. Bullshit. She hated us. That's what I thought. Yet, here we are. For what? Read. You can read, can't you? Or was your school too far from your trailer park? We don't have to take this. Sit down. I don't want anything of hers. Really? Not even $100,000? Did you just say $100,000? What's the catch? Pardon me? With people like you, there's always a catch. People like me. You don't know anything about me. You don't know anything about me or my wife. We know all we need to know. So you think. If you knew anything about Edith, you'd know there was one thing she liked. And that was to play games. I like games. What kind of game? Simple ones, really? Now, are any of you superstitious? Not afraid of ghosts or things that go bump in the night? I don't believe in any of that shit. So the answer would be no. It's a no for me too. And what about you boys? Good. Well, the game's simple really? There's a phone upstairs in the study at the end of the hall. All four of you must go up there one at a time. There's a number next to the phone. You call it. You stay on the phone for one minute, you get $100,000. That's it? That's it. Easy as pie. Who are we calling? You're calling Edith. See, she had me bury a phone with her. Okay, now that's crazy. Edith was always a little eccentric. Wait, so all we gotta do is stay on the phone for a minute? One minute. That's it. Then you exit out the back door and the money will be yours in the morning. And what if we hang up early? Then your money will be split between the people who stay on the call. I still call bullshit. I don't know what you're up to. Read the contract. It's all legal. Legal or not, I don't want your money. Hey, speak for yourself. If I get this, we're set. Zack, there is no we. You gotta get that through your head. And I'm outta here. Screw your game. Tonya, before you leave, dear, there's one more thing I need to tell you. What? Edith's death was not an accident. The paper was kind enough to omit the details, but Edith killed herself. That sucks. What does it have to do with us? Everything. You see, she left a suicide note. And in that note, she made it very clear that your constant threats to her, you and your little friends over the years was more than she could bear. She was a strong woman, but she was depressed. And all those years of torture- - They were just pranks. They were pranks to you. They were devastating to her. Devastating. Then your little confrontation with her the other night. That was the final straw. I was traveling. I wish to God I was here, but I wasn't. She was all alone. She was afraid for her life. And she knew that not one person in this town would protect her from you or you or you. Oh God! I didn't even know her. But you were here. You saw it. Yeah. What are you saying? I'm saying, you let me honor my wife's last wish by making the call. Otherwise, I'll go to the police with the note. Make sure that you all pay for what you did. I loved Edith more than life. Even more than revenge. That's why I'm giving you a choice. Now, I'm gonna pour myself a drink. When I get back, I expect an answer. You guys aren't seriously considering this, are you? Hell yeah. We may not wanna grow up in the shit hole, we'll tell him about this Right now I need this money to get outta here. Crazy as you say she is, I have to admit I've seen stranger things. I can't get the police on my tail. Why? You got a record? I just can't. A one minute phone call. There's four of us. We each call, we could be gone in five minutes. So what's it gonna be? Do you make your call or do I make mine? We're gonna do it, but if you try anything... You don't have to worry about me. I'll be outside the back entrance waiting to greet you when you're done. Just one of you can go upstairs at a time. The rest of you have to wait down here. Don't go snooping around. Once one of you has completed the call, the Lira clock upstairs, it will chime. Then the next person can take their turn. Zack. You're such a tough guy. You go first. Brett, you like following your brother's footsteps. You'll be second. Chris, you follow Brett. Tonya, you'll make the final call. Lucky me. So good. I know that Edith's looking down on us. Smiling knowing that her final wish has been granted. Once we're done with all this, we can put the ugliness behind us and we can start to heal. Well, that wasn't creepy at all. Hey, bro. It's just a phone call. I know that, dumb ass. Zack. Zack. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. I'm fine. We're not all pussies like you. Let's do this. This house is whack. What the hell! Hello. Who is this? I'm so glad you called. Okay. Fine, I'll bite. How're you doing this? Let's not waste time with questions. Can you do me a favor? Yes ma'am. And what is it that I can do for you? Be a dear and look in the mirror. What the hell is this? You're in my world now. You know what? The hell with this? Boys. Brett, get under the bed. No, Zack. I can't. There's monsters under the bed. Just do it. Come on. Unlock this damn door. How many times have I told you about locking the goddam door in my house, huh? Oh, you're gonna stand up to me now? Yeah. Let's see it then. Come here, you little piece of shit. I'm not afraid of you. Are you a big man now? Yeah? Why don't you show me? Take your best shot. You're pathetic. Both of ya. Come on. You know what time it is. I don't know why you make me do this to you. Zack. Zack. Zack. Zack. Zack, Zack, Zack. You know you cannot run from me, because I am always gonna find you. Dad. You. So just like I thought. You are still too much of a pussy to fight back. Dad... You're a complete embarrassment, Zack. I'm embarrassed to be your father I'm gonna give you one last chance to hit me, you piece of shit. I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. You can't? I can't. It's okay. That's a good boy. I just wanna go home. It's all right. That's a good boy. You're gonna go home. Son of a bitch. What kinda door doesn't have handles? He's taking too long. I want my money. Simmer down. It's only been a few minutes. Yeah. Yeah. All right. It's my turn. - Wait. - I am not pussy. If Zack can do it, so can I. See you when I'm rich. Hey, would you mind holding this? Yeah, sure. You can have it if you want. Weird day. You're fine. You're not weak, and you're not a pussy. Shit. It's just a phone call. Hello. Hey, I'm calling about my money. You've called the right place, Brett. Mrs. Cranston? Yes. You're alive. Holy crap. So this is all a joke? Wait, so you faked your death, and now you're fucking with us? Fucking with you was the last thing I wanna do. And speaking of fucking with you, Brett, how's your daddy? What did you say? How's Harliss? Where are you? I'm everywhere, and that is the amazing thing about being dead. The things you learn. The things you see. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? I mean, I knew your dad was a horrible man. The way he beat your brother, I can't imagine treating a child with my likeness- - Shut up. Shut up. But you, after his wife died, he started hurting you, in unimaginable ways. I said, shut up. Do you remember your favorite nursery rhyme, Brett. ♪ Something very scary is underneath my bed ♪ Could it be a monster underneath my bed? All you have to do is stay on the call. And? Check to see if the monster is under the bed. What bed? No, Zack. There's monsters under the bed. You can run but you can't hide. How many times have I told you about locking the goddam door in my house, huh? Oh, you're gonna stand up to me now? Why don't you show me? Go ahead. Take your best shot. Pathetic. Both of ya. Zack. Zack. Son. She wants you. You're so sick. I'm not afraid. You're scared your little friends can hear ya? You know why this happens? Because you're too weak to do anything about it. Have you seen this? Don't tell me he actually made it. I didn't hear the back door open. Me neither. But... It's your turn. All right. Weird or not, let's do this. See you on the other side. Hey. Good luck, new fish. Hello, Chris. So many secrets, so much pain. How do you handle it? Handle what? I love you. Me too. What's wrong? I wanna tell mom and dad. You're not having second thoughts, right? No. No, I just... Can't we wait a little longer? What? Just until the semester is over. We've got finals and that big trip with my mom. She's gonna totally flip when she finds out. She's gonna flip? My dad's gonna ground me for life? He's probably gonna make us get married. But you wanna do it? After we graduate. Look, this isn't just about you. We didn't plan this. It's happening and we have to deal with it. Bat can we just deal with it whenever the time is right? Now. Now is the right time. I'm already showing. What am I supposed to do? Just wear baggy clothes and just tell people I'm gaining weight till you feel comfortable to tell your mom? No. Can we talk about this? There's nothing to talk about? I have to tell them, and if you can't support me then... Sarah. Sarah, I... I do... What did you fucking do? Christopher. Christopher. Christopher Michael. Hey. Come, hold my hand. Listen, we don't have much time. We've gotta hurry. It's not over yet. I missed you so much. I missed you too. The way you got in is the way you get out. What do you mean? Find the phone. I love you. Always. Now go. Go now. Find the phone. Brett. You're alive. What's happening? The phone. It's the only way out. I think I saw it this way. What are you talking about? The phone is right here. Brett. Brett. Tonya. Tonya. Everything ready? Yeah. They bought it. The contract, your death, everything. Good. Two down, one to go. And once you take care of the little slut, the money will be yours just like I promised. Good boy. Tonya. I'm right here. Where is it, you bastard? Well, calm down. Where is the gun? The only gun I see is the one you're holding. - Yeah, right. - I came back for you. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't move. I saw you and Edith on the TV. You saw her? Yes. On the TV? Yeah. And I know what you're planning. I swear. I don't know what... Put the gun down. You're right. You saw Edith, but she's not alive. She's something else. What? I know it sounds crazy. I know this all sounds crazy, but there's no game. There's no money. The call. It's just a trap. It's just a trap. She tricked me. She tricked all of us. Where are Brett and Zack? They're dead. We've gotta get outta here. They were into some really twisted stuff. When I made the call, it was like I was transported. I don't understand. Where? Darkest reaches of my mind. I don't know. It's hard to explain. But what I saw there... But you're still here. You're alive. 'cause I didn't give up. Maybe you should have. You all... You all took the only thing that I cared about in this world. But we figured out a way to stay in touch. The phone. Technology's a wonderful thing. It can bring people together or it can tear 'em apart. Yes, dear. Yes, I know. The boy came back. It's a pity really? Yes, my love. She wants to talk to you. Fuck you. Get on the phone. We gotta get outta here. The door's open. Dammit. Dammit! There's an exit in the call room. Go! Tonya. Tonya. Tonya. No, please. Tonya. Leave me alone. No. You should have left me alone. But you couldn't, could you? Because you needed someone to blame. Shut up. Shut up, you fucking witch. So innocent, so pretty. Laura. Sit down. A little birdie told me today is someone's birthday. For your special day, I got you something special. What is it? Tonya. Why are we going this way? It's a shortcut. Did you see what Mrs. Cranston gave me? She said I was special. Yeah. Everyone thinks you're special. So special. Hey, give it back. No. I'll tell dad. Tonya. Daddy's little girl. I hate you. She was his favorite and you couldn't stand it. Now I'm daddy's little girl. Hello, Tonya. When I saw you wearing the necklace that I gave Laura, I knew she was dead, and I knew it was you. When they told us she was missing and I was blamed, I died inside. The demons, they swirled around me and I joined them. And they took me down, and they took me down and they took me down. Until nothing was left in me but hatred and rage. And you know what's so interesting? You're in the same boat. You and your stupid little friends, you're all gonna suffer, and you're gonna die violently with your own hatred and your own rage. Please, leave me alone. Oh, you don't have to worry. You are very alone. There's a special place in hell for you, little girl. Do you know what hell is? There's a special place for you, and it's not what the good book says. It is not fire and brimstone. It's reliving your worst nightmares over and over and over. Tonya. Come play with me. Tonya. Come play with me. I told you we'd be together forever. Tonya. Tonya. Mrs. Cranston. What do you want? Vengeance. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You're not sorry about anything. Certainly not about me. My husband. You're in my world now. Christopher. Sarah. Why'd you leave me? Why? I was coming right back. Liar. Hello.
