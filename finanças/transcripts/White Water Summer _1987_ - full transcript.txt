[ Birds Chirping ] By the age of 17, a person should have adopted the three guiding principles of his life. One is sexual, one ethical, and the third, optional depending on the circumstances. My choice: no camping. Nobody really great ever slept in dirt. You ever see a picture of Da Vinci pitching a tent? No. How about Einstein nibbling trail mix? No. Let's take a look at the really great campers. Genghis Khan. A lifetime under the stars. Mu'ammar Gadhafi, perhaps the world's greatest camper. Mr. and Mrs. Marcos. Well, they recently took it up. She likes the boots. For 14 years, I had ducked all kinds of camps-- soccer, sailing, tennis, computer, even chess. Till this guy showed up. My intellectual and sexual powers were just starting to climb, and my father wanted me to go to the woods with a bunch of boys? I'm supposed to do all this with a guy who doesn't know he's supposed to take a cab? And there was Jenny. Her parents were goin' away in July, and she was gonna be home alone. But I leave for six weeks of Rambo training, and Fred Bernstein'll be in there in one second. I become a man, and he gets the girl. What an asshole. Stay cool, Alan. Panic now, and it's summer in the Sierras with Robin Hood here and his merry men. [ Man ] It's his first. It's a beautiful fish. [ Slide Projector Shuttering ] That's his second day in Red Bluff. We camped here. [ Woman ] Beautiful! [ Man #2 ] It's wilderness, honey. That's the real thing. - [ Man #2 Laughing ] - [ Man #1 ] Tim caught this one. It was his first. Beautiful fish. That's his second day in Red Bluff, and we're heading upriver. We camped here. There's no sign of man for miles. It's just birds, animals, fish, a lot of silence. What if one of the children gets sick, like something serious? - That's what I'm there for. - Oh. That's Devils' Tooth. We climbed the face. There. - [ Woman ] Awfully dangerous. - [ Boy Narrates ] Good call. - Here we are, homeward bound. - Jesus, you really do make men out of these boys, don't you? Well, I think they make men out of themselves. That's it. [ Boy Narrates ] Oh, shit. This guy is slick, maybe too slick. We're making a big mistake. He doesn't want to go. Look at his face. - Alan, what do you say? - Well, I liked the pictures. God, when I was a kid, I was lucky if we got to "Y" camp in Jersey. It is awfully far. I think city kids need a time of isolation, of quiet. Yeah. Yeah, see, I think that's the point. Alan, it sounds great, doesn't it? - Last week, you wanted me to go to computer camp. - [ Sighs ] The thing is, Alan is not exactly the outdoor type. What do you think about that? I think that's right. And I think next year, when he's a little older. [ Alan Narrates ] Come on, Mom. You're my last line of defense. Tell 'em I'm too young, scared of heights, allergic to open spaces. Yeah. Yeah, that's the ticket. What do you say? Sounds like fun, doesn't it? I'll tell you something else. I wish my dad had done this for me when I was a kid. We run three groups in late summer. There's an opening in the third group if you want. - I don't exactly like big bunches of kids. - I know what you mean. - I was an only child myself. - You were? Yeah. I can't believe how much you guys have in common. - I don't know about that. - [ Man ] There's only one way to find out. - Besides, it's not a big bunch. There's only five of us. - You said four kids. Yeah. I'm five. [ Alan Narrates ] The moment of truth. To pull this one off, I gotta be firm. Absolutely not. No indecision. I will not go. Come on. How about it? I'm not sure. I mean, I don't know. [ Alan Narrates ] So I lied.

Alan, what the hell are you doing? This is the part where we eat, right? You're gonna cut your tongue off, asshole. I can handle it. Let me see it. Turn it around. It's a West Horn. One of the counselors had one of these where I went last summer. Showed us how you could really put an edge on it. Better be careful with that, kid. One false move, you cut your own balls off. I'll try to stay alert. Watch out. Let a real man take care of business for a second. You're never gonna get through it in one shot. [ Boy #1 Grunts ] [ Boy #2 ] Wrong. Ha. When do we eat? [ Boy #1 ] As soon as Alan gets back with the water. Great. We'll starve. - Alan. - Hiya, Vic. - We're waitin' for the water. - Oh, shit. - Any time now, huh? - Yeah. Dumb. Dumb. [ Groans ] [ Bird Screeching ] - [ Boy Screams, Laughs ] - [ Alan Screams ] You dumb shit. That scared the shit out of you! It did not. [ Laughing Hysterically ] Come on, dickface. Wait up. Yeah! All right! - [ Boy #1 ] Yeah! That's way cool. - [ Boy #2 ] Way to go! I wanna try that, Vic. All right. Check it out. [ Sighs ] That's the way we make the first fire. - From now on, we use kitchen matches. - [ All Laughing ] Look. Can you see up there? We're under the sign of Otagawa. Those four stars, they're his hands and feet. And the three in the middle there-- that's his belt with his stone knife. That's Orion. Shut up. What the hell do you know? Alan's right. That constellation was called Orion by the Greeks, but up here, he was Otagawa, the hunter. See, he hunted... not to eat, but to destroy. He was an enemy-- enemy of the land... and of the trees. He killed his brother, the rabbit and the deer. So the manitou punished him, flung him up in the stars, to stay up there forever alone. Chris, get the lantern. - Chris? - You could take his knife away. Take my knife away? George? That's fair. Mitch? Well, you could give it back to him after a while. - Alan? - You gotta say somethin'. It's fair, right? I mean, you gotta say it's fair. Do you think it's fair, Alan? [ Unsheathing Knife ] [ Radio: News Announcer Speaking, Indistinct ] Chris, come here. Ohh. Can you believe that? No. [ Both Chuckling ] That's incredible. I don't understand how they do that. [ Vic ] Okay, guys. Let's go. [ Chris ] See you later. [ Exhales ] [ Cash Register Ringing ] How you doin'?

George, last one across puts up the tent. [ Radio: Announcer Calling Ball Game ] All right! All right! Yeah! Cool it, asshole. It's not over till it's over. [ Announcer ] Nice play by Carter. Whoo! [ Chuckles ] Tent's all yours, bud. Fat chance. I won. Come on! Come on! [ Announcer ] Line drive! You can do it! Come on! [ Announcer ] Can't get to it! [ Vic ] What are you doin'? It's just the Mets game. They're playin' San Francisco. - We've let all that go, now, haven't we? - It's the top of the ninth. - Two more outs, and then we'll let go, okay? - Now! What are you doin'? Did you ever notice that people in authority don't say what they mean? Take Vic. I carve my initials in a tree. So I made a mistake. Does Vic say, "Don't carve your initials in the tree"? No. He says, "Over there's Otagawa. "They flung him into the sky. He's an enemy of the land. I think we'll take Alan's knife." Now I'm listenin' to the ball game. Vic wants to say, "Don't listen to the radio." Instead, he says, "We've let all that go, now, haven't we?" Obviously I hadn't. [ Chris ] So I go upstairs to take a piss, right? And I look in the medicine cabinet, and there's this little, round plastic box... with numbers all around it-- you know, the Pill. [ George ] What pill? [ Mitch ] The Pill, stupid. [ Chris ] So I opened it up, and I replaced every other one with something else. [ George ] What? What? [ Chris ] I don't know. Vitamin "C" or something. [ Mitch ] Bullshit. [ George ] Listen to this. She says she's a Leo and likes long walks in the woods and young-- [ Chris ] Let me see again. [ George ] What are you? A pervert? How many times you gotta see it? [ Mitch ] I got it next. [ George ] Who paid for it? [ Chris ] Will you just give it to me? Alan? Yeah? Didn't you say you liked to play chess? Mm-hmm. How about a game? Now?ut here? I got a travel board. Okay. All right. Check. Check this out. Shut up. Fine. - Damn. I took my hand off. Now I can't move it. - It's okay. No. Play by the rules. That's mate. Nah. Yeah. Checkmate. My bishop, my rook, my queen. - What happened? Dickface win? - Yeah. Dickface won. [ Chess Pieces Clinking ] It's not a bad run. You just have to remember everything I told you, okay? Keep your center of gravity low. Now, two of us are gonna take the canoe down, and the rest of you are gonna backpack the sleeping bags and stuff. All right. I'm gonna be in the stern, but I need a good bow man. Alan, put your helmet on. What? Me? Why him? I thought I'd be the one. - What do I have to do? - Just do your best. [ Water Roaring ] Vic?

I can't even believe this! Do you believe this? I can believe it. I don't believe it. I'm sleepin' in your tent, asshole. Come on! You know we needed those poles. Where'd you put 'em?

We've got a couple more weeks together, and I want to get a few things straight. There'll be no more radio, you understand? And no more lying. What are you talking about? The tent poles, Alan. I was there. I saw what happened. You never crossed the bridge. You were afraid. You saw me? You cannot lie. You cannot lie to me. You saw me? This is crazy. You must be crazy. I don't wanna hear that radio again. [ Panting ] Now different people have different ideas about what's dangerous and what's not. Let me show you something. You figure it out for yourself. This bridge is 5 feet off the ground. The real one was 182.

I'll buy you another one, all right? Forget it. You think he'll come back? Who cares? "Who cares"? How are we gonna get home? The only thing I care about is that I haven't peed in two days.

Next victim! That's you, Mitch! All right, we're rollin'! Let's go! Nice catch, Mitch. [ Whooping ] [ Vic ] Same thing, Mitch. Make sure you're locked, and don't forget the sling. You're gonna love it, Mitch! Ready. Okay, Mitch. Get a good kick off the rock. [ Yelling ] - Whoa! - [ Chattering ] All right! Hey, Alan, man, there's nothin' to it! Really, man, honest!

That's nothing to be ashamed of. - I'm not afraid. - You can do it. I can't. I know you can. Come on, come on! Trust yourself! - Come on! Do it, man! - [ Vic ] Alan, there's no other way. You gotta do it. - You gotta do it, Alan! - Do it, will ya? - Vic... please. - Alan, do it! - Do it! Goddamn it, do it! - Whoa, Vic! - Vic, help! - Vic, do somethin'! Grab somethin', Vic!

It's okay. Help, Vic. Now, can you get a foothold? Uh, no, I can't. Try. Try. Get a foothold... and ju push yourself off from the rock. I can't do it, Vic. I can't do it. Try. You gotta try a little harder. Help me, Vic. Why don't you go get him? Swing over! No! No, not that way. Alan, I know you can do this. - I can't! - I got you anchored. You're not gonna fall. - Oh, Jesus, Vic. I can't do this. - You can... if you try. For Christ's sake, Vic, I can't do it! - Don't you understand? I can't do it! - Then that's where you'll stay. - What? - Vic! - What do you mean? What are you doing? You can't just leave him there. You can't just let him hang. - Alan, we'll meet you down below. - Vic, where are you going? He said he couldn't do it! [ All Shouting ] Vic, the guy is scared to death! You can't leave him hanging! - Vic, come back! You can't just leave me here! - You can't! You're crazy! What if he falls? He could die out there! Vic, please! Mitch. George. Mitch. Vic! Come on. Where you goin'? Vic! I'm telling the truth, Vic. I'm scared. Mitch. Move it! Don't leave without me. Please. No! Don't leave, Mitch! [ Vic ] Let's go! Vic, you're not just gonna leave him there, are you? Yeah, I am. For how long? It's up to Alan. But, Vic, h-he's scared. He can't just-- He can... if he tries. What if he doesn't try, huh? Come on, Vic. Can't you just get him down this once? Well, someday I'm not gonna be there to get him down. Then what's he gonna do? Why are you doin' this? I am not doin' anything. Alan is doin' this to himself. Now, is that a problem for you, Chris? Yeah, it is a problem. I'm goin' back. This is not acceptable behavior. [ Gasping ] Is that clear? [ Clears Throat ] We'll camp here for the night. Okay with you guys? [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] All right. Do it. [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] The way I figure it, we won't go back to the old campsite downstream. No, we'll go north. We'll follow the great bear. You were wrong-- what you did to Alan, Vic. He's right, man. You must be crazy, leaving him up there. No. Yeah. Yeah, we'll go north. - Vic, I don't know why you're doing this, but-- - What's that? Shh! It's Alan! You did it! Son of a bitch. You did it, man! Way to go, Alan! You did it! You made it! All right! Way to go, man! All right! Way to go! Are you all right? I don't believe it! [ Laughing ] I knew you could-- I'm goin' home. Wait. Well, you can't. You don't understand. Don't you see? You did great! I knew you would. Don't you see that? We're all together again. Come on, we did it! Yeah, I did it. Fuck you. I could have died. He's right, man. Alan-- Alan, you don't understand. None of that matters now. Look at you! Look at what you did. You made it! I-I did that for you. I'm goin' home. Me too, Vic. You gotta take us home. We wanna go home! What's the matter with you? You don't want to miss tomorrow. Come on! We're goin' north! I can show you wolves up there. I can show you mountain lion-- Bye, Vic. Alan, wait. Wait! Wait. Where you gonna go? It's gonna get dark. You need me, guys. You'll never get down the mountain by yourselves. I don't care. I'm goin' home. No, you're not! I'm responsible for you guys. We're goin' home, Vic! [ Chuckles ] Chris-- You can't. You can't. You understand? You can't leave. You can't leave. Chris. Chris, what are you doin'? Go. Get outta here. Go! Don't leave. You can't leave. We're a team. Do you hear me? You can't leave me. We've been walkin' for hours. It's 'cause we've been walking in circles. [ Bird Calls Eerily ] It's too dark. We gotta camp. I think I like that plan. Yeah. Think we'll ever get outta here? Chris? I can't believe Vic did this.

I'd better stay with him while you guys go downriver for help. No, we'll just leave him here and send help back for him. - Somebody's gotta stay with him. - Alan, he left you! I don't care. It's not the same thing. He's hurt. - How the hell are we gonna find the ranger station? - You'll find it. You figure the river'll lead us down? Yeah. Just remember to keep the sun at your left. All right. We'll get someone here as soon as we can. Put that over him. All you have to do is hike downstream. You'll reach the ranger station by tomorrow. Sure you'll be all right? Yeah, I'm sure. We're outta here. Good luck, Alan, huh? See ya soon, all right? Yeah. Bye. [ Clears Throat ] The others went for help. You know, that thing you rigged-- it saved my life. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Makin' fire. Yeah. How come you're doin' it that way? I thought you hated all that stuff. We sort of lost the matches. [ Pained Breathing ] [ Laughs ] This wasn't on the itinerary. At first light, we're takin' the river. I thought you said help was comin'. Change of plans. Alan, you can't take the canoe. It's too dangerous. Y-You don't know how to-- We'll just wait here for help. We can't. Your leg is broken. You're losin' a ton of blood. [ Sighs ] I'll do whatever I can to help. [ Gasps ] Vic! Vic! Vic! [ Coughing ] Don't worry, Vic. You're comin' around! You're comin'! Reach out! I got you! Put out your arm! Grab! Reach! Grab my hand! Hold on. You got it. You got it. [ Grunting ] Pull. Pull. Hell of a ride, huh? Remind me to put it on the tour next year. How's your leg? It's been numb most of the way. Oh, man. What you did back there-- that was brave. It took guts. I didn't do this 'cause I wanted to. It wasn't fun, and I wouldn't do it again. I mean, what's the point? We didn't make it anyway. The point is, you made it down that river. I was trying to get you to a doctor. I don't give a shit about the river. You... are the most stubborn... son of a bitch! Except maybe for you. How did your father ever talk you into comin' this summer? I was young. It won't happen again. Alan, it's our ride home! We made it! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Hey, we're here! Hey!

I gotta tell you what happened to Chris, Mitch and George. They made it to the ranger station, grumbling somethin' about bad directions. What did I know? I was in charge. I had to say something. [ Sighs ] I made my peace with Vic, and I learned somethin' too: Everybody needs a time of isolation, time to be one with nature. So, every year I come to these woods to contemplate my place in the universe, fish, to live off the land. [ Alan Narrates ] I know what you're thinking: I've lost my mind.
