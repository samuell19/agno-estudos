Or perhaps she just has a very good imagination. It was probably easier to fall in love back then. There weren’t so many... Distractions. So you know her books, too? You could say that. ‐Thanks again. ‐Enjoy. Merry Christmas! - Happy holidays. - Happy holidays. So? What do you think? ‐Holland, I‐‐ ‐Fabulous, right? Diana, I am so excited to be re‐releasing your first book. You make my work look so good. Our frontier stallion’s looking better than ever. ‐Don’t you think? ‐Who, Greg? I didn’t notice. ‐He looks the same. ‐Don’t be coy with me. His perfect jawline and washboard abs have sold millions of copies. And your excellent writing, of course! But seriously, Diana, when are you finally gonna make a move? I’ve been a little busy. And, besides, I don’t think Greg sees me that way. He is intimidated by a talented, beautiful, extremely successful woman. Trust me, it’s time you took a lesson from your own heroine. Suzette St. James is a woman fulfilled. I’ll have you know I’m very fulfilled. You hide behind your work, Diana. I can’t even get you to do a book tour, for goodness sake. I’m not having this discussion again. If you don’t do it for me, then at least do it for your fans. If my readers find out I’ve never been in love, well, they’ll think I’m a fraud. It’s time to be the heroine of your own life. Go get the guy. Now? I leave for Maple Creek tomorrow. Invite him to go with you. Christmas together in a romantic, beautiful setting. Sounds like the perfect getaway for you to finally confess your feelings. ‐Do you really think that‐‐ ‐Tell you what... If you invite Greg with you to Maple Creek for the holidays, then the first chapter of your new series is due in January. If not, I’ll need it by Christmas. Uh, but that’s three weeks away. I only seem heartless. Your advance. We’re banking on another hit series. So let’s kick it off with a scintillating first chapter. I guess I better get writing. Oh, wait. ‐What cover did you decide on? ‐Neither. The pose works, but the background should be the maple grove where they had their first stolen kiss. Diana? Don’t over‐think it. Just be honest with Greg about how you feel. She awaited her love, ready to confess her deepest desires. No. As the sun beats down on the steamy plains of... No. People will just wonder if she’s wearing deodorant. Maybe she’s dreaming. Maybe she’s... Wearing completely the wrong thing! No wonder I can’t write today. Okay. That’s better. Okay. Now calm down and let the romance flow. ‐Yes? ‐Hey, it’s Greg. Greg? I thought we were getting coffee in the morning. Yeah, but I was in the neighborhood and I’ve got some big news. You mind if I come up for a minute? Diana? Hello? Okay, but walk up slowly. All right. Coming! Ah, hello, Greg. What a nice surprise. Diana Darrows, you look amazing as always. Stop. I’ve just been writing all day. No mas. ‐Diana? ‐Yes, Greg? ‐May I come in? ‐Come in? Oh, yes, yes, of course! Come in. - Looks nice. - Thank you. ‐This is my house. Yeah. ‐Yeah. ‐Oh. ‐That’s you. Um, may I get you something to drink? A wine? W... No, it’s, uh, it’s 2 o’clock in the afternoon. Oh, is it only 2:00? I lose track of time when I’m writing, so... Why don’t we take a seat? ‐Yeah. ‐Hm. Diana, are you okay? ’Cause y‐you’re acting kind of weird. I’m sorry. Um, my head’s a mess. Holland gave me this crazy new deadline and, well... Okay, well, that’s not it, um, I’m just a little nervous because... This is really hard. Well, it should be ’cause I benched over 300 pounds today, so... ‐Oh, no, not your bicep. ‐Oh? ‐Uh, it is hard, though. Yeah. ‐Yeah? Way to go, for you. Um, but that’s not what I meant. Okay. Diana, what is it? Uh, is this about the new covers? Because I was not feeling myself at the shoot that day. No. No, you’re gorgeous. The covers are gorgeous. They’re the best ones yet. ‐Actually. ‐Great. Save the best for last. Or is it the first again? Or... Does that make that a reboot? Greg, listen. Um, I have this crazy idea about you and I and... Well, I wanted to ask you about Christmas‐‐ That’s, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. ‐No way. ‐Yeah. I’ve been invited to the 23rd Annual Adonis Multi‐Triathlon. I leave tomorrow night, and it’s all thanks to you. ‐Me? What did I do? ‐Your books, of course. I mean, no one knew who I was until I appeared on your books, and now I’m getting all kinds of amazing offers. Can you imagine spending Christmas on the beach in the Caribbean? No. I guess I can’t. Uh, sorry, what was it you wanted to ask me? It’s nothing. Well, I was just thinking if you didn’t already have plans, that maybe you might want to experience Christmas in Maple Creek. Just because so much of my books are inspired by it. Wow. Um, that’s so nice of you. But this competition sounds great. And I’m so happy for you. ‐You better send me a postcard. ‐Thanks. Yeah, and I will. But, but, hey, um, I’d love to see what Maple Creek is like. Hey, how about, how about I, I give you a ride tomorrow morning? Greg, Maple Creek is three hours away. I’m sure you have better things to do with your time. Uh, no. No. I picked out all my favorite swimsuits. Oh? Okay. Uh, if you don’t have anything else to do, then... ‐Yeah? ‐Yeah. Well, what else are friends for? Right? ‐Friends. Right. ‐Yeah. ‐Right. ‐Yeah. Oh! Okay. Oh, yeah. ♪ November days turn gray in the middle ♪ ♪ Being alone makes you feel so... ♪ So how long has Maple Creek been a real town? Well, it was one of the first Frontier settlements in the west, some of the original buildings date back to the 1860s. When my parents were alive, they helped turn the site into an open‐air museum. And now my best friend Kayla and her mom Lynda run the place together. Oh, so they’re like the mayors? More like curators. I just wish you could stay and meet everyone. You would love Uncle Timothy. So your uncle works there, too? Well, we’re not actually related, but everyone calls him their uncle because he makes you feel like family. He’s been the town blacksmith for decades. Hey. A real‐life blacksmith? Get out of here. Turn right here, and we’re at Maple Creek. - Welcome to Maple Creek. - Thank you. ♪ If I could have one wish I would... ♪ Oh, there’s a chapel. ♪ With you ♪ ♪ And wash away these Christmas blues ♪ ♪ If I could make it snow ♪ ♪ Pass presents to people I know ♪ ♪ Help wash away these Christmas blues ♪ ‐Isn’t it beautiful? ‐Like your books come to life. Diana, I can’t believe I’ve never been here before. Oh, well, I would have invited you earlier, but I didn’t think you were into any of this history stuff. I’m not. I mean, I wasn’t. You just have a way of making everything more interesting. Right, well, I should probably hit the road. ‐Hm. ‐Merry Christmas, Diana. Wait! Greg, I have something to tell you. ‐Yeah? ‐Um... Go get ’em! "Go get ’em?" What am I, his gym coach? Kayla! Kayla, we need to talk! Kayla? Kayla? Uncle Timothy! Thank goodness! Are you here? It’s Diana. Really need to talk. Under here! Your voice sounds off. Are you coming down with a cold? Can I hand you anything? Uh, no, no. I’m almost done. Good, ’cause you’ve always helped me out when I didn’t know what to do. When did you know you were in love? ’Cause there’s this guy I may be in love with. Well, maybe not in love, but very much in like. The thing is, I freeze up every time I try to tell him. I don’t know what my problem is, if I’m more afraid of rejection or of Greg actually being my happily ever after. Does all that sound crazy, or is that what love is supposed to feel like? Depends. What kind of car does he drive? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, easy! Oh! Oh! ‐Oh! Ow... ‐What is all the yelling about? Diana, you made it! ‐Oh. ‐What happened to Uncle Timothy? I don’t know what happened to your Uncle Timothy, but my Uncle Timothy retired last month. I’m Carter Macintosh, his nephew. Hi. ‐Carter is our new blacksmith. ‐Part‐time blacksmith. By day I’m a history professor at the college in town. Now that the semester’s over, I spend most of my time helping out around here. What kind of history do you teach? Uh, Old West. Post‐Civil War mostly. Ah. What a coincidence! That is what Diana specializes in, too. You’re also a history professor? I’m a novelist. Historical fiction. Diana is too modest. She is one of the top romance novelists. A romance novelist scared of falling in love. How ironic. How does Carter know about your commitment issues? I don’t have commitment issues. Well, does Greg know that? Greg? Did you finally ask Greg out? Personally, I think you two would make a great couple. You don’t even know who Greg is, or who I am, and you should have made your presence known before I blabbered on to a complete stranger. And miss all the gossip? Nah. Can we go somewhere that’s private? Sure, yeah. You can leave your things. We’ll get it later. What did you do? Hey, my office is open any time you need to talk. Shut up! Although I charge extra for relationship advice! Romance novelist. Don’t mind him. Carter’s been a great help, you’ll get to know him. He already knows one of the most intimate details of my life. Yes, catch me up, please. So are you and Greg a couple now? ‐Ish. Almost? ‐Ugh! ‐Well, so close. ‐Mm. So he doesn’t know anything about how you feel. No. I didn’t get a chance. ‐Lynda! ‐Hey! You got here just in time for a special kick‐off Christmas picnic. And for the one true love of my life, bacon. Maple Creek Christmas bacon. Your combo of brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and whatever else you fry this in should be illegal. Hm. I shouldn’t. This is way too decadent. But these are Christmas calories. ‐Yeah, so they don’t count. ‐Hm. I better eat quickly before your visitors snag it all for themselves. I saw a few guests in the town square. When do the big crowds usually roll in? These are the big crowds. Hm. Attendance has been dropping steadily for a while now. We had to sell off the horses. You sold the horses? All of them? Had to. Upkeep was too expensive. And this is the first Christmas that we haven’t even rented out one of our cabins. But we’re hoping that the Christmas festival will help bring in the holiday crowds. A Christmas festival is a great idea. What do you have planned? You’re looking at it. Maybe we should’ve spent more money. But I didn’t wanna spend the money if I wasn’t 100% guaranteed that we would make back the revenue. The truth is, if we don’t get enough visitors or donations, we may have to close. ‐For the winter? ‐For good. Face it, Diana, people just aren’t interested in coming to Maple Creek anymore. Not like when we were kids. So let’s make them interested. Okay, but we need money to do that, so... Did the settlers who built Maple Creek have a lot of money when they arrived? No. So let’s use that same gumption and create an authentic Maple Creek Christmas. It wouldn’t take much. We can make snowmen out of the hay bales, and I’ll dress someone as Father Christmas, and turn the museum into an old‐fashioned candy shop. Well, are you coming or not? Yes! We can get a lot of ideas. And we could recruit some singers from the nice church up the street to dress in authentic clothes and sing Christmas carols. And what about you? Didn’t your new book just come out? ‐Two weeks ago? ‐Yeah. You could do a signing right here. You always said Maple Creek is what inspired you to write. Listen, I’m glad to sign books for you to sell. Yes, but it will be an event if it happened in person. Think of the crowds you would draw. ‐Lynda, I’m hardly Santa Claus. ‐No, you’re not. Although I’d love to see you try to climb down a chimney. Right now I would like to go to my cabin and unpack. Ooh, I meant to make up your bed. Ooh, sorry. Oh, just give us a minute to finish in there. Oh, we’re so happy that you’re back, sweetheart. ‐Hm... ‐Hey, uh... Excuse me. Excuse me. I have a message for a Diana Darrows. ‐Yes? ‐Oh, is that you? Hm. It’s from a guy named Greg. I believe his last name is, uh, Happily Ever After. ‐Why is Greg calling you? ‐Well, he wasn’t. He called the office and I picked up. Why didn’t he call my phone? Probably ’cause you can’t get a cell signal around here for like five miles. Nice handwriting. I think you missed your calling as a doctor. Sorry. I’m a bit messy. Let me see. Greg says, "Glad I got to see a bit of Maple Creek." Hm. "And don’t worry, I made it to the airport in record time. See you in the new year." ‐Fine. Thank you. ‐Oh! And he also wants to know if you wanna get married. ‐What? ‐I made that last part up. But, hey, if you play your cards right, I bet he’ll pop the question before you know it. The only thing about to get popped around here is... Listen, if he calls again, I would really appreciate you coming to get me. And miss all this fun? I also appreciate how amusing you find my personal life. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve a lot of work to do. Cabins are that way. ‐I knew that. ‐Hm. For sure. ‐Just around the, uh... ‐Thank you. Mm‐hmm. This is going to be the perfect place to write. I need to come up with an idea fast. Are you sure you don’t wanna stay in town with us? The last thing you and Jake need is me camped out in your living room. Besides, I want to embrace the rural lifestyle I’m always writing about. I will have the handyman fix that in the morning. Maple Creek got a handyman? Can’t wait to meet him. You‐you kind of already have. Uh, from the... ‐Sorry. ‐Yeah. Well, okay. Ow! Ow! Oh! ‐Are you okay? ‐Yeah, no. ‐I’m‐I’m fine, totally fine. ‐Hm. You know, I’ve spent most of my summers and Christmases here since I was little. I’m surprised we never ran into each other. I know. I’m sure we would’ve been best friends. ‐Are you almost done? ‐Nope. Actually, I’m all the way done. I repaired the window and fixed the door. What’s that? It’s an ornament that’s been in my family for years. Every year I put it on top of my Christmas tree. Wow. Great craftsmanship. I thought I would display it somewhere before I get a Christmas tree to put it on. I want this cabin to look the way it did when it was first built. For an authentic Pioneer Christmas? ‐Precisely. ‐Well... Then you better toss that thing in the forge and melt it down for tools. When settlers first came to Maple Creek, materials like this were too sparse to waste on something as frivolous as a Christmas tree. This isn’t frivolous. Maybe the family who lived in this cabin saw a decoration like this as uplifting, something essential to embody the spirit and soul of Christmas. The spirit and soul of Christmas? ‐Mm‐hmm. ‐Oh, I forgot. ‐You write historical fiction. ‐Historical romantic fiction. So who cares what people really did as long as it looks good? ‐Yeah. ‐Gotcha. ‐Excuse me. ‐Okay. I don’t ignore history, I enhance history with modern details and sensibilities that make it more accessible for my readers to enjoy. Which explains why my students have no clue what real history is, because they’re probably confusing your books for the real thing. How is that my fault? I’m a novelist, not a historian. Look, you screw with people’s ideas of the past by turning historical figures into bodice‐ripping lovers. I bet you don’t even know what a bodice is. Oh, please. I know what a bodice is. Mm. Why are you in my kitchen? Kayla asked me to make sure you have enough supplies to cook with. Well, I don’t need much. A kettle to boil water, a spoon, a fork and a pot for my oatmeal. Oh. ‐And maybe a new pot. ‐Yeah. Give it time to cool down, but it’ll get the job done on your oatmeal. What’s with the tribute to Montana? ‐Are you from there? ‐No, but I’m moving there soon. I’m saving to buy my own horse ranch. When are you going? Why? You wanna make a donation so I can leave today? The only donations anyone should be making are to keep Maple Creek going. I have no idea how I’m gonna do this. Yeah. Well, whatever you do, make sure you use the chapel. Lynda just refinished it. She’s been working on that for years. Come on, oatmeal. Let’s go see what else you have to work with. So what are you thinking? I know we’ll draw in new visitors if we make Maple Creek look just the way it did in the 19th century. Do you have a year in mind? Mm, probably 1870. Nice. You know, 1870 is the year‐‐ America officially recognized Christmas as a national holiday. Not all the history I studied in school was fiction, Mr. Macintosh. Touche, Ms. Darrows, do this right, and I may have to ease up on you. A Pioneer Christmas. That’s what we’ll call it! ‐Just like my book. ‐What? Who will call what? Holland, my publisher, says the title of a novel is as important as what’s in it. We could do an entire week of Maple Creek festivities in their authentic time. ‐Sounds like a lot of work. ‐Not really. Everything is already set up for us. We could do a Christmas pageant in the chapel and... Come on, you can teach your blacksmithy workshop. Can’t wait. And I know Lynda makes very good bacon. It’s a little burnt, but good. And we can do a Christmas bacon fest in the general store. And we have to turn the stable into a Pony Express station. Uh, could you make a Pony Express sign? Maple Creek never had a Pony Express station. But the Maple Creek I write about in my books does. That’s where Suzette and Thorne met. Sorry, Thorne? Is that even a real name? Yes, it’s a real name. And if you knew everything Thorne had been through, you wouldn’t be making fun. He was an orphan when the Pony Express took him in. Thorne was an orphan? It was love at first sight for Suzette and Thorne when they met at the Pony Express station. Wow. And then what happened? Oh, wait, these people aren’t real. No, but if my fans show up, they’ll want to see the Pony Express station Thorne worked at. Look, this is a historic site, okay, not an amusement park. I agreed to help you because I thought you wanted to recreate Christmas in 1870. Well, how authentic do you want this celebration to be, Carter? Should we serve everybody brown drinking water and, oh, take away a woman’s right to vote as soon as she walks through the door? Merry Christmas! By the way, your barber’s also your dentist. Enjoy the eggnog. Eggnog was considered an aristocratic drink. It was definitely not served at Christmas in the Frontier until the dawn of the 20th century. ‐Fine, you win. ‐Yes! I may not know what people were drinking in 1870 or 1970 or yesterday at noon, but what’s happening today is me making a success of this Christmas celebration with or without your help. So mark today down in your history book and remember it. It was a pretty good comeback, actually. "A Pioneer Christmas Celebration at Maple Creek." I like it. Yeah, every day of the week leading up to Christmas Eve we can focus on a particular landmark in town. And what happens on Christmas Eve? I haven’t decided yet, I was hoping you’d help me come up with an idea. Wait a minute, Maple Creek never had a Pony Express station. I’m just kidding. But I’m sure Carter will have a lot to say on that. That man is impossible. ‐That man is single. ‐Big surprise. And he’s been single for over a year, which means you don’t have to worry about the rebound situation. There is no situation as far as Carter is concerned. I like Greg, remember? ‐Hm. ‐What? Do you like Greg or do you like the fantasy of Greg? You two have known each other for years now and you still can’t tell him how you feel. So? My feelings needed time to marinate. You marinate a steak, not a relationship. Speak for yourself. ‐Come on. ‐I do love the idea, though. I think it’d be fun to start off in the church and... Ooh, and then we could wear costumes. I’m telling you, I think it would be a great idea. Well, Kayla, you know I’m not gonna do that. Well, he’s really cute and I think‐‐ You two! It’s like high school all over again. What’s so funny? I was telling Diana that Carter is single and available. He’s also stubborn and irritating. Besides, I don’t have time for men right now. I have a new book to write and Maple Creek to help save. Now do you like this idea or not? I love it. Let’s do it! ‐Really? ‐Yes! Hey, what are we doing? The Pioneer Christmas idea we discussed. With a special guest appearance by the Pony Express. ‐Thank you very much. ‐Kayla. Do you have enough money in your budget to pull this off? I can juggle the numbers and figure it out. Well, include this in your juggling. Absolutely not. This is too much. It’s the advance for my next book, so it’s money I wasn’t expecting anyways. And besides, every year I donate to Maple Creek. Oh, so you’re donating for the next ten years in advance? ‐Is that against the law? ‐Uh, we... I... I don’t know what to say. Say thank you and show me where you keep the authentic clothing so we can start dressing people up. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s just back here, the stuff. Wow, she really puts her money where her mouth is. She is an extraordinary woman. Carter, that popcorn is three days old. It’s easier to string garland when it’s stale. ‐I knew, I knew that. ‐Mm. I like it better this way. Yum. Oh, I used to love dressing up in these outfits for old‐timey photos. Oh, we should do a photo booth again, but holiday it up. So then people can dress up and make their very own Maple Creek Christmas cards! Oh, I love it! What if we take a few photos now and use them for an online promotion? Yes! And you would look great in this gown. We can style your hair and everything. Good luck! I’m a novelist, not a model. You’ll have to call in a favor elsewhere. We’ll see. And you’ll have to try on this hat. Oh, it’s perfect. ‐Can I be the model? ‐Please! Oh, we need to get a camera. What time are the models supposed to get here? ‐It’s almost noon. ‐I hope they didn’t get lost. Carter’s theater professor friend assured me they’d send over a few students. Maybe we should give her a call. Don’t bother. I just got off the phone with her. The students who agreed to model got stuck in dress rehearsal for their holiday show. I guess we have to reschedule the shoot for another day. There no time! Good thing I know two people, and they happen to be very photogenic. ‐Oh, that’s great! ‐Who are they? ‐It’s you two. Yes. ‐No. Th... I... You look great in this light. I promise. ‐ Really? ‐ Yeah. No, Kayla, let me see that. I wasn’t ready. Stop struggling or else I won’t be able to loosen this bodice. This is what it feels like to wear a bodice? No wonder my heroines always want this ripped off. It’s torture! Here, pass me a few bobby pins so I can put up my hair. Kayla, are you... Oh! Um, I wasn’t sure if I should wear the bowler hat or the cowboy hat. People will probably be expecting the cowboy hat, but the bowler hat was actually still in fashion out here, so... Oh, I look stupid, don’t I? No! I told you, I’m not a model. No, Carter, you misunderstood us. ‐Then why did you both laugh? ‐We weren’t laughing. We’re... I’ve never truly understood the word dashing until right now. Yeah? You’re smooth. Okay, Annie Leibovitz, where do you want us? ♪ Oh I can’t wait another day ♪ ♪ There is something I gotta say ♪ ♪ I can’t get you out of my mind ♪ ♪ And it’s about time to say I think I’m fallin’ in love ♪ ♪ Fallin’ in love with you ♪ ♪ There’s no one else I’m thinkin’ of ♪ ♪ Nothing else I wanna do ♪ ♪ I think I’m fallin’ in love ♪ ♪ Oh‐oh oh‐oh oh‐oh‐oh‐oh ♪ ♪ Oh‐oh oh‐oh oh‐oh‐oh‐oh ♪ ♪ Oh‐oh oh‐oh oh‐oh‐oh‐oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ I think I’m fallin’ in love ♪ Oh. Oh, I need to post one of these on my fan page. Just don’t use the ones where we’re wearing the Santa hats. They didn’t wear Santa hats in 1870. These are great, but if anything, they would have worn holly in their hair which is how Father Christmas, not Santa, was depicted back then. Oh, why didn’t you say something earlier? I’d love to wear holly in my hair. ‐Good to know. ‐Hey. ‐I’ve got some bad news. ‐What’s wrong? Well, our accountant double‐checked the projections on how much we need to raise to keep Maple Creek afloat. And even if we hit our target attendance, uh, we’re still off by a pretty large amount. Oh, honey, unexpected donations might come in. Yeah, I’m sure my colleagues will throw in a few bucks when they see what we’ve done with the place. That’s all really nice to think about, but nothing we can bank on. If we don’t raise the money then, this could be our last Christmas at Maple Creek. Since our festival ends on Christmas Eve, we need to devise something grand. Something that will attract people and get them to pay big money. ‐A dance marathon? ‐Uh‐uh. ‐A quilting marathon? ‐Huh? ‐A real marathon? ‐Mm. How’s it going in here? Any ideas yet? We’ve talked and re‐talked about so many ideas, and my head is throbbing. And we’ve eaten all the fudge. But Uncle Timothy always said that the key to unlocking any problem is to remain optimistic. Think positive. This will work out. Yeah, but we have to be realistic. We’re talking facts, not fiction. What about a big lunch or dinner on Christmas Eve? Mm. We went over that already. A meal is cumbersome and too expensive. No, we need something that’s already here in Maple Creek. Something that won’t cost much to organize, but will draw in a big crowd. Come on, everybody, think. ‐You. ‐Yeah. I’m trying to think, too. No. You. ‐You are the big idea! ‐No, he’s right! Oh, see, I told you, I have been trying to get her for years to come and do a signing. ‐Nobody wants to see me. ‐Why not? The only reason we’re making the stables look like that historically‐inaccurate Pony Express station is because of your books. And if your fans come and see a fake Pony Express station, then they will definitely come and see you. More will come and see you. ‐But I don’t do that. ‐Do what? Meet people. I have a reputation for being hidden away. Remaining aloof is part of my brand. Oh, I didn’t realize we were in the presence of the great Greta Garbo of the local literary intelligentsia. N... Oh, no, it was a joke. Who’s Greta Garbo? She’s so famous, Kayla. Okay, one thing history has taught me is that the public loves a celebrity. ‐I’m hardly a public icon. ‐Right. ‐But to your fans you are. ‐There has to be a better idea. Why? Because you don’t want to? No! No, it’s not that. It’s just that... I can’t believe I’m admitting this to you of all people, but I’m scared, okay? I’m scared, too. Maple Creek isn’t just special to you. It means a lot to me, too. What if nobody shows up and I end up disappointing everybody? Or worse, what if my fans do show up, and I’m a huge disappointment to them? What would my uncle say to you right now? "Diana, suit up and show up." ‐ Yeah. ‐ Fine. But there has to be more than just me... ‐For the price of the ticket. ‐Fine! Let’s do this the right way. What do your fans wanna see? What Suzette St. James would do if she was here. And she would host a Christmas Eve gala. We can encourage everyone to come dressed as their favorite Hearts Of The Wild Frontier characters. It will be as if they’re stepping into one of my novels for real. ‐ Oh, you want me to follow? ‐ Yes. Okay. Yeah. We can hold a dance in here. Nothing too fancy. Suzette may be dramatic, but she is also humble. What about auctioning off a dance with the novelist herself? Perhaps. These cabins are perfect for a writer’s retreat. We could sell packages. And I could even host a workshop or two. Wait, hold up, a minute ago you didn’t even wanna be seen in public, and now you’re scheduling more appearances? ‐You sure you’re up for this? ‐Yes, I think I am. Good, it’s about time you saw yourself the way everyone else does. Like you know me so well. We just met. Well, I can’t believe I’m admitting this to you of all people, but I’m glad we did. Oh. ‐Hello? ‐Hey, Diana. ‐How’s the wild west? ‐Greg? Hi! Hold on. Let me just say goodbye to Carter. Who’s Carter? Oh, he’s just a guy I met. Well, not a guy. Well, yes, in a physiological sense. I mean, I’m assuming all the parts are there. But, wait, why are we talking about Carter? You brought him up. Um, so how’s the Caribbean? Well, you know, I’m a little nervous about the competition. Figured I’d call you to feel better. - He is.. - Oh, my God! Really? Why me? ’Cause you’re always so encouraging. Maybe I just need another, uh, "Go get ’em." You’re gonna be great. Greg, I know it. So how’s the new book coming along? I’m having my first ever book signing. ‐Right here in Maple Creek. ‐Oh, what? I thought you were doing the whole unknown mysterious private life of the writer thing. I was, but Carter helped me realize how silly and contrived that was. Carter? He sounds so convincing. Has he swept you off your feet yet? What? No, of course not! I just met him. I’m‐I’m joking, I’m joking. Well, I’m really proud of you. Just wish I could be there for your big event. ‐I wish you could, too, Greg. ‐Yeah, yeah. I do, really. Before you left, I wanted to tell you that‐‐ Oh, they’re calling us to the line. I gotta run, literally. Wait. What did you wanna tell me? Um, it’s nothing. But good luck today. Thank you. This should be good here. Mm‐hmm. ‐ What do you think? ‐ Hey! ‐Here, look! ‐All the job’s been assigned? Mm‐hmm, and we have more help now than I ever thought possible. Calling in your fans with that post was brilliant. As president of the West Coast branch of the Diana Darrows Fan Club, I consider it an honor to be your Santa Claus. I mean, Father Christmas. That’s my man. The honor’s all mine, Jimmy. I can’t believe I’m meeting you in person. You’re younger than I imagined, full of so much wisdom. That’s the beauty of words, they speak for themselves. Would it be too much if we serve hot cider, cocoa and buttered rum? Just don’t serve eggnog, or Carter will have an aneurysm since only aristocrats drank that in 1870. ‐ I can hear you. ‐ I know you can. Look, I don’t wanna jinx anything, but I think everything’s going to work out. I think it’ll be great. I think we’re gonna have a wet Christmas instead of a white one. I know you, Diana. You’ll make it work. Holland, thank you for your generosity, donating the proceeds from the novels sold on site. Of course! This is momentous. The first ever public appearance by my number‐one novelist. Oh, by the way, how’s the new book? I’m revisiting the first chapter tonight. ‐It’s very clean. ‐Hopefully not too clean. Uh, hold on. I think there’s a wild animal trying to get me. Hey, the storm’s getting worse. I wanted to make sure you had enough firewood for the night. Kayla and Lynda already went home. Holland, I better go. Oh, before you go, Greg called the office today and he wanted to know if it’d be a good idea for him to make an appearance at your event. But Greg’s in the Caribbean. Just think of the publicity we’d get if fans saw the two of you together. It will be like Van Gogh with his Mona Lisa. Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh cut off his ear, which is what I feel like doing right now. I thought you liked Greg. No, I do like Greg, but I’m nervous enough with the signing. I don’t need the added pressure of having him here. You know, if you need help dealing with Greg, I can give you a few pointers. Thanks, Holland, but I... Hey, Holland? Diana? Hello? Are you there? Is Mr. Biceps coming for a visit? I don’t know. Perhaps. ‐That’s a good thing, isn’t it? ‐Perhaps. Why do you have this look like you’re about to be audited? ‐I do not. ‐Do, too. I do not. In fact, I do hope Greg comes for a visit. Great! I can’t wait to meet him. ‐He’s a tremendous guy. ‐A prince among men. He is! Very kind and charming. Which explains why you’re panicked at the thought... ‐Of him showing up. ‐Exactly! I mean... Oh, just get out and leave me alone. Nothing would give me more pleasure. Maybe you should wait here until the storm blows over. Believe me, the storm in here is much worse than what’s out there. My truck got stuck. It’s like a river of mud out here. Is that invitation to wait out the storm with you in here still open? I promise, no more talk about Mr. Muscles. In fact we don’t, we don’t have to talk at all if you don’t want. Do you have any marshmallows to, uh‐‐ I thought we agreed. No talking. ‐Seriously? ‐It was your suggestion. Besides, I’m behind on my writing and I need to concentrate. Okay, sorry. Won’t bother you. In fact, I’ll stay on my side of the cabin over here and you can stay on your side over there. But your side has the fire. But I gave you the kitchen. The kitchen and fire are neutral. Fine. Fine! ‐Where is that coming from? ‐Shh! Shh at you. Hey, I think I found it. Why are you standing behind me? ‐Why are you Macing me? ‐Oh. Um, let me get some water for your eye. Oh, I think I may be blind. Don’t be a baby. It’s just a little perfume. Why are you wearing perfume? You got a big date later? No, it’s part of my routine when I have writer’s block. ‐Can you open your eyes? ‐Oh, God! ‐Oh. Can I borrow that stuff sometime? It smells really good. Oh. You scared the heck out of me. What, me? I’m the one who should be scared of you. You macer. I was just trying to find the leak. Okay, I can’t get any writing done now. Call a truce and make dinner? What are you doing? Just making sure you’re not concealing any other weapons. ‐You’re clean. ‐Okay. ♪ Stay inside won’t you... ♪ At least the power’s back on and we’re not cooking in the dark. ♪ Don’t let ♪ Mm....

This is good! ‐ It really is! ‐It’s really good! ‐Wow! ‐What do you call this? ‐Frontier hash pie. I found the recipe while researching one of my novels. ‐Which one? ‐Hearts Of The Passion Trail. It’s the book where Suzette gets snowbound on a wagon train... And Thorne gets amnesia and she helps him remember who he is by cooking his favorite meal. So you have been reading my novels. Yes, but only out of morbid curiosity. I’ve been giving you such a hard time about your books being historically inaccurate. That’s putting it mildly. But now I’m completely hooked. You gotta tell me, do Suzette and Thorne finally end up together or not? You’ll have to read the last book. Oh! Wait, the last book? ‐So the series is over? ‐Yeah. Hearts Of A Pioneer Christmas is the end. I already miss writing about Suzette and Thorne. Hm. I’m going to miss reading about them. You’re a good writer. Did you just compliment me or are pigs flying outside? I’m serious. What made you want to become a writer? I love words, I always have, and the power they have to move us. And the Hearts series, I mean, why Suzette and Thorne on the frontier? I suppose writing the Hearts series let me live out a life that’s always eluded me. ‐ Romantically? ‐ Well, yeah. Don’t we all want a romance like Suzette and Thorne’s? Well, that’s not it. I’m an only child and I lost my parents when I was young, so Suzette’s close relationship with her family has always been wish fulfillment for me. You know, everyone living together under one roof. I’m sure your readers connect to that. And what about your family? Are you close? Yeah, but we moved around a lot for my dad’s work. When I was a kid, we never had that one‐roof thing, you know, a real home, except when I was here visiting Uncle Timothy. I guess that’s part of why Maple Creek is so special to me. I’ll toast to that. To Suzette and Thorne. May the romance they’ve always wanted finally come true. How was the couch? Eh. How was the bed? Probably better than the couch. I didn’t mean to wake you. I was ready to make a clean getaway. If I could only find my other boot. ‐Here, I’ll help. ‐Go back to bed. It’s early. No, I should have been up hours ago. I still have no idea what I’m writing about. I don’t know why I’m having such a hard time. It’s not like I’m writing the sequel to War And Peace. Well, maybe that’s it, maybe you’re struggling because you don’t believe your writing is special. You should value your talent. Well, I appreciate the sentiment, but my books don’t exactly change lives. ‐ Ah! ‐ Are you okay? Wait, isn’t this yours? ‐Oh, it broke last night. ‐It’s actually not that bad. I think I can weld this back together. ‐You’d do that for me? ‐Yeah. As long as you tell me if Suzette and Thorne get their happy ending. Go read it! I’m not spoiling the ending for you. Well, fine, then I guess I don’t have time to fix broken ornaments, you know, with so much reading to do. Okay. Fine. Then you’re never getting this back. I see, you can play dirty, too. Are you serious? ♪ Stars twinkle at night ♪ ♪ Hot chocolate Rudolph leading the skies ♪ ♪ All I need is you ♪ This is really beautiful work. Thanks, part of me is kicking myself for agreeing to auction it off at the gala. I planned on taking it with me when I move to Montana. ‐Why Montana? ‐Uncle Timothy’s out there now. And a buddy of mine is the dean at a nearby college. He’s been begging me to come out and revamp the departments. And frankly, it’s time for me to move on. Kayla mentioned you had a breakup last year, and so... ‐Oh, jeez, sorry, I’m prying. ‐No! No, it’s okay. Yeah, we split summer of last year. For a long time I felt really brokenhearted over it, that I wasn’t enough for her. Eventually, I realized she wasn’t enough for me either. It’s probably why I’m a bit guarded. If you don’t let anyone get too close, you don’t get hurt, right? Um, the way to make sure this never gets broken again is to put it on top of a tree, where it belongs. Yeah, there, uh, there are some great trees in the meadow behind the chapel, all sizes. We should go. Right, but you have writing to do today. Hm. Carter, do you wanna know what the secret is to writing a good novel? What? Putting it off as long as possible. What’s your ideal number of horses? ‐My ideal number of horses? ‐Mm‐hmm. Uh... Do I have to say it? I’m just, just unlimited horses. - Out with it. - We’re almost there. Okay. Take your pick. They’re all so beautiful. ‐But I think that one. ‐This one? ‐Yeah. ‐Good choice. And how can I properly thank you? Don’t worry about it, I just want you to enjoy your Christmas. Okay, fine. I’ll tell you. Yes, they do. "Yes, they do?" In the final book, Suzette and Thorne finally get their happily ever after. ‐Wow! ‐And then that’s it. Is that a bad thing? In a way, because I can’t write about them anymore. And I can’t think of anything new to write about, because I keep wanting to write about them. So do it. Just because two people get their happily ever after doesn’t mean their story’s done. The rules of romance novels are very strict. You get your happy ending, and then that’s it. No more. The end. Goodbye. Right, but that’s not how life works. Yes, it is. Take you and I for instance. After Christmas you’ll move to Montana and I’ll be back in San Francisco. ‐End of story. ‐Hm. I didn’t know you and I had a story. No, we don’t. I was just using us as an example. Ah. I see, so the rules of a romance novel don’t apply to us? ‐No. ‐Good. Because I always thought rules were overrated. You are both alive! Ugh! That storm last night was awful! Carter, did you know your truck is stuck in the mud? You don’t say. Was I interrupting something? ‐Yes. ‐No. No. I’m just gonna just go that way. Uh, let me come with you. Oh, but the tree... No sweat. I got it. What happened with you two last night? ‐Nothing. ‐Oh. I love it when that kind of nothing happens. Kayla, your mind is more twisted than a Jackie Collins novel.

The Pony Express station! It’s exactly the way you described it in your book. Does that answer your question? I know I look silly, a guy like me, gushing about your romance books. No. My books are for everyone. My wife, Amy, she got me hooked. She always talked about Suzette St. James like it was her best friend. I love that. Where’s she? I wanna meet her. Ah, that’s not possible, ma’am. Uh, Amy died two years ago. Oh. I’m so sorry. It was real hard for her when the cancer got into her eyes and she couldn’t see to read. One day I started to read the stories about Thorne and Suzette to cheer her up... I still read the stories out loud every night, hoping that wherever Amy is, she can hear them. ’Cause they made her so very happy. Thank you, Jimmy, for sharing that with me. It really means so much to me. It’s my pleasure, Diana. I mean, thank goodness there are stories like yours that we can all escape into. It’s those little escapes that, they give us the strength to face another day. I’m sorry... for giving you such a hard time about the Pony Express station. It’s very real to your readers. I guess my books do have meaning after all. Diana, Carter, come on, you have to see this. Come on. Whoo! You like it? Now just wait for this, though. Now, Carter, before you get on me about how Maple Creek didn’t have electricity in the 1870s, keep in mind, it also did not have a fire marshal, so I had to improvise. I’m willing to make an exception. Are you still doing the auction, to dance with you at the gala? I suppose, but it won’t be much of a prize. ‐With my two left feet. ‐Hah. Well, maybe you should practice. ‐With him! ‐Hm. Um, if you’re not too busy. You wanna dance with me? Oh, I’d ask Fred Astaire, but he doesn’t seem to be around. ‐Your hand is trembling. ‐Sorry. I’m a bit nervous. I haven’t danced with anyone since... Uh, maybe this isn’t a good idea. Uh... no. I think we both need the practice. ‐ May I cut in? ‐ Greg, what are you... Ta‐da! ‐Hi. I’m‐‐ ‐Carter. I figured. ‐Diana told me all about you. ‐Um, Carter, this is‐‐ The Adonis on your book covers. ‐I recognize the chin. ‐Mm. Greg, what are you doing here? You said you wished I could be here. And I started thinking, maybe Christmas in the Caribbean alone might be a little, well, lonely. ‐Is it okay that I came? ‐Of course. I’ve just been so busy getting ready for tomorrow night’s gala. Holland needs a new chapter by tomorrow. ‐ I’m a mess. ‐ Please! If anyone can do it, it’s you. Plus I’m here to help. ‐With my book? ‐No. No, with the, with the gala. I thought maybe I could pose for some pictures with the fans, raise some money for Maple Creek. Greg, that’s genius! The fans will go nuts. You know, I would have come earlier, but, uh, I had to stay for the, uh, award ceremony. You won? Wait, don’t let go. Unless you wanna go dance with Carter. You know, he’s not a bad‐looking guy, but I don’t think he can bench as much as me. Oh, that’s a very smug thing to say. What can I say? That’s how I am when I’m jealous. Ah. Do you want a tour? Everyone who comes to Maple Creek for the first time gets a horseshoe. ‐It’s pretty cool. Yeah. ‐Yeah? Make sure you hang it with the prongs up so your luck doesn’t fall out. Thank you. Diana, I didn’t come here for a horseshoe. Although, this is, this is awesome. I came here for you. The whole time I was in the Caribbean, I was thinking about your invitation for me to come here and spend Christmas with you. I spoke to Holland, talked to me about your book singing and she did more than hint at the fact that maybe all you wanted for Christmas was me. ‐She what? I... ‐Diana, it’s okay. I didn’t have the guts to do it myself. I’m glad she did it. Actually, I never thought that I was good enough for you. What? You not good enough for me? ‐Greg, that’s crazy! ‐Yes, you. A woman who can create worlds for others to see, simply by reading the words that you write... You’re, you’re inspiring. And to be honest, hearing you talk about Carter, I got worried, when I saw the guy was gonna snag you before I ever got the chance to tell you... Greg, I don’t know what to say. Don’t say anything. Listen, tomorrow night, after the gala, I’m driving back to San Francisco. I want you to come with me. Think about it? ‐Hm. ‐Okay. Thanks. Oh, hey. Did I catch you at a bad time? No, um, I was just reflecting on how quickly these past few weeks have gone by. Yeah, time flies when you’re having fun. So Greg’s here. That’s good. Right? Diana! Diana! Wait. Tell me I don’t have a chance with you and I’ll leave you alone. I’d be lying if I said you haven’t come to mean a lot to me. ‐So I do have a chance? ‐Look. I’ve only known you for a couple of weeks and we’ve spent most of that time arguing. No, we spent most of that time talking. Is that supposed to be a compliment? It is. You don’t take my crap! Just when I became jaded with everything, I met you. You reminded me how beautiful and special and fun Maple Creek is. And not just Maple Creek, but life in general. For the first time I’ve met someone I can truly be myself with, who seems to actually like who I am. I do, so much. So what do you think, can we give this a shot? Are you still set on Mr. Calendar Man? There’s more to Greg than his biceps. We have history. And I’ve only known you for two weeks! Oh, come on, you forgot all about Greg until he came out of nowhere and asked you to go back to San Francisco with him... And that was a very private conversation. In a very public place, which I did not interrupt. Y‐you stayed and listened, didn’t you? I feel so stupid. Diana, please don’t leave like this. Carter, these are my decisions to make, not yours. If you don’t mind, I just need a little space. Diana, Carter? Kayla, it’s really not a good time. They’re gonna close us down. An inspector from the state came by today. What’s the problem? Well, uh, we’re being rezoned and so we need new heating, and plumbing. And basically, the entire infrastructure has to... Even if we were to make twice as much at the gala, we can’t, we can’t do that. We... So what happens after tomorrow? We have to close down Maple Creek. How much more do you need? I’m sorry. I tried so hard to make a miracle happen. I... ‐ Carter? ‐ Only me. You’ve got quite a crowd out there. ‐You’re not bailing, are you? ‐No. I just can’t seem to get my hair right. ‐Oh. ‐It’s this stupid holly. Sit. I’m a professional at this. ‐Have you seen Carter? ‐Not since this morning. He had a bit of business to take care of in town. I need to talk to him. I said some things last night that I regret. I’m sure he’d be happy to hear you out. I see the way Carter looks at you. And then there’s Greg who seems to be enamored of you also. I’m gonna screw it all up. I should stick to writing about romance. And Holland needs a chapter by tomorrow. I can’t do this. Yes, you can. You’ve always been able to see both sides. That’s what makes you such a great writer. This isn’t fair, two of the most wonderful men I’ve met in my entire life, both want to be with me. There are worse problems to have. I won’t pick either one. That way no one gets hurt. Except you. I can handle it. My parents gave me a thick skin. I’m sure your mom and dad would be thrilled with the woman you’ve become. ‐You think? ‐Absolutely. You know what’s great about the times we live in? We get to choose who we want to be with, who to build a life with. And what if I can’t make up my mind? Well, it’s not always about what’s in your mind. You’re no longer the little girl who hides behind her books. You’re a woman who writes all about hearts. You have a chance to make your dream come true if you choose. So, remember your heart. ‐You ready? Let’s go. ‐Let’s go. Ugh. Go for a ride on that horse. ‐Thorne, too? ‐Yes. ‐No way! I wanna sit... ‐Oh, my God! Where’d you go? Thank you. Take two minutes. Hey. How’s it going? ‐Um, busy. ‐Yeah? Hope we have enough copies. ‐How are things with you? ‐Good, good. Yeah. Three ladies already asked me out, so... Oh! And what did you say? I told them that I had an inquiry out for someone else. Did I use the word inquiry right? Yeah. ♪ Ha‐ha‐ha bells on bobtail ring ♪ ♪ Making spirits bright ♪ ♪ What fun it is to ride and sing ♪ ♪ A sleighing song tonight oh jingle bells... ♪ I just, I wanted to impress you, I got a word‐of‐the‐day app on my phone, so... Greg, do you mind if we talk later? We just have so many fans waiting. Yeah, I just, I just need to know if you’re coming to San Francisco with me tonight. ‐ Oh! ‐ Hah! A perfect picture of a picture‐perfect couple. The trades will go wild for this one. Holland, I was getting worried you wouldn’t show up. And miss all of this? No way. Besides, I’m also here for my Christmas present. You promised me the first chapter of our new book. But it’s only Christmas Eve. So tomorrow. I said by Christmas. Hm, you sound exactly like my father who wouldn’t let us open any gifts until Christmas morning. Oh, Greg, the Caribbean sun looks good on you. We need to talk. Kayla, why are you hauling all those books by yourself? Hey, Carter can help. Ooh. He’s still not here. ‐Do you know where he is? ‐Uh... My guess is now that Maple Creek is folding, he’s packing his bags to Montana. Don’t say that. I mean, look around. Maple Creek is more popular than ever. I love your enthusiasm, but this isn’t one of your novels where we can write a happy ending. But if this is the end of Maple Creek, I’m happy I’m here with my best friend. Whoo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo! Yes! Yes! Diana, I did it! I‐I... You did it! ‐ We‐we‐we all did it! ‐ Greg, shush! We haven’t even inked the contracts yet. ‐Right. Right. ‐Uh, contracts? For what? Exercise books, online videos, and if everything goes well, my very own line of exercise equipment. They’re gonna call it The Cardio Casanova. And it’s all because of you. Because y‐you put me on your books, and... What would I do without you? Oh. The gala is about to start! Mm, mm. Will you two please lead us off in the dance? ‐Yeah, of course. Let’s go. ‐Mm‐hmm. Uh, Greg, I think you might be forgetting something. ‐Huh? ‐Your jacket. ‐Oh, right. ‐Yeah. Right, I’ll... Yeah. You are the Grinch who steals all my Christmas fun. Mm. Oh. I’m sure he’ll show up. Who? Come on, Diana. I’m not that naive. I need to talk to him. The way we left things last night... I said all the wrong things. I... I’m sure he’ll understand. How? I barely understand it myself. You know, Diana, before I met you, I thought all my dreams were just fantasies. But now all those dreams are reality. And I want that for you, too. You know what I think? I think everything you ever wanted is right here. I mean that literally, right here in Maple Creek. There you go. Carter! You missed the bacon. Ah, sorry. Everything took longer than I expected. ‐Where were you all day? ‐Ah, not important. How is it going with the fundraising? You make any more? Kayla did more than anyone ever expected. ‐I am so proud of you. ‐Thank you. Kayla, the reason I was gone today‐‐ Is because you’re mad at Diana. Why would I be mad at Diana? Uh, well, that’s what she thinks. She’s been out of her mind with worry wanting to see you today. ‐She has? ‐Yes. ‐Where is she? ‐She just... And I’ve been thinking long and hard about us. I’ve been thinking long and hard about what I asked you yesterday. I don’t want to be with you. Wait, what? I mean, you’re in love with Carter. That’s clear as day. Yes. You’re right. But wait, why don’t you want to be with me? Don’t get me wrong, I thought I wanted to be with you, but now that this whole Cardio Casanova thing is really lifting off, I‐I think I need to focus on my passion. ‐You know? ‐That’s wonderful! I like us as friends. We’re better that way. I agree. Oh. - Wanna dance? - Yes. ‐What are they so happy about? ‐Ah. Looks like those two finally got together. Took long enough. I’m so sorry, Carter. No. Don’t be. She finally got her happily ever after. Isn’t that what we all want? I think it’s time for me to head out. You can’t leave. It’s Christmas. Which is why I should be with family. If I leave now, I could be at Uncle Timothy’s by tomorrow night. There’s nothing here for me anymore. But I’m glad she found what she was looking for. Oh. I almost forgot. This is for you. What is it? A happily ever after for Maple Creek. I can’t believe this. Should I go tell her? Oh. Okay. Diana, I have the best news. You won’t believe what just happened. Oh. We have good news, too! Yeah. We’re not gonna see each other. What if we’d actually gone through with it? It would have ruined the friendship. To think we almost kissed. Diana, you’re not making any sense right now. Then again, neither did Carter just make any sense. Anyway, here it is. Look! This money will help us cover the expenses that Maple Creek needs. It’ll help us thrive for years to come. He give you all his life savings? No. That money was for his horse ranch in Montana. Oh. I can’t believe he’d give all that up for this. I can. Where is he? I need to see him. ‐Oh, Diana, I’m so sorry. ‐What? When he saw you and Greg just now, he thought you two decided to be together. But we’re not. Well, I know that, but he didn’t. He left for Montana.

But when I was little, I always wanted to know what happened to Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and all of the others after they found their prince. To me, happy endings didn’t seem so happy if that’s when all the fun stopped. I never wanted the dream to end. But what if nothing really ends? What if it’s just more beginnings?
