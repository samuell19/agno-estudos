(SCREAMING) (BEEPING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (SPEAKING JAPANESE ON RADIO) Why do they name typhoons after woman? Come on, baby. What's he saying? Why don't you learn to speak Japanese for yourself, Mike Takashima? Wind velocity, 85 miles per hour. Taxi! Well, it looked like a taxi. Maybe that's the reason they name typhoons after dames, baby. Come on, let's make a run for it. -Morning. -Good morning, Colonel. What have we got? There's no change. Could be a little worse. -Okay. Thanks very much. -Yes, sir. 26 degrees, 20 minutes North. 123 degrees, 27 minutes East. Roger. (ALARM RINGING) Ten-hut. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. This is Ashiya airbase. Ashiya Hikojyo. Hi. Is Captain Jim Anderson registered there? Anderson-san kudasai. Anderson-san kudasai. Hi. Lie. I do not know his room number. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Never mind. Thank you very much. Domo arigato. Good morning, gentleman. I trust you slept well. Okay, gents. Here it is. A Japanese freighter broke up in typhoon Kathy right about, uh, here. If you have nothing better to do, they'd appreciate it if you flew down there and picked them up. -Trouble. -Right here, Colonel. Captain Cooper and his crew are ready for takeoff. I'm trying to round up somebody to fly cover. -What's the hold up? -Captain Deeds is still in the hospital. -What about Carson? -Well, Carson and Lundquist are marooned up at the dam. Power lines out. I've been trying to run down Jim Anderson. No, that's no good. He's still on furlough. Well, there's nobody else, Colonel. I see. Well, I'm still qualified in the SA-16. I'll fly cover. -Well, that would certainly help. -What's the crew? Lieutenant Gregg is your co-pilot. Captain Sumpter's navigator Sergeant Garrison is flight engineer and Airman Dennis is on the radio. Paramedics are Takashima and Smith. Lieutenant Gregg, co-pilot. Mmm-hmm. -Okay, thanks a lot. -Yes, sir. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -Good morning, Colonel. -Oh, Lieutenant. Well, seems we'll be flying together again. I'm flying cover. Yes, sir. It's been a long time. Yes, sir, it has. I'll start the pre-flight check, sir. Okay. How do you like that? Somebody had to fly the mission. Yeah, but why Stevenson? He works for the Inspector General now. He doesn't fly missions. Look, you got no sweat with Stevenson. You've been flying as well as you ever did. Yes. Co-pilot. And never with Stevenson in the left seat. It had to happen sooner or later. You'll be okay. Yeah. Well, I better start that pre-flight check. Is that you, Colonel? Yeah. Let's go! I'll pick you up after school, buddy boy. Don't get your feet wet, Captain. -Good morning, Major. -Good morning, Miss Caroll. Smoke? I don't smoke when I sleep. Smart. Might stunt your growth. Take over. I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. How's our boy doing, Colonel? He'll be okay. Just a little jumpy flying with me again. That's all. -That'll wear off. -Sure. I killed them. I killed them all. What are you doing in Germany, Colonel? Studying rotor wing operation. How do you like that? Colonel Glenn Stevenson flying co-pilot for me. You escaped from prison camp. Shot down 19 Japanese planes. Of course, you wouldn't know it, sir, but you were my pacer. You know like milers pace each other to break their own record. While I was still at Princeton, I picked you. I even kept a press book on you to keep myself on my toes. And after I enlisted, I kept telling myself "Now, there's a man you have to beat." So how did you do? Just my luck. We won the war before I had a chance to fight. I guess that was a lucky break for me, huh. So, here I am. The Flying Boy Scouts hauling vaccine for the Red Cross. Down there, sir. On our right. That's where the trouble is. Yeah, you can see the avalanche is all along there. Yeah. It's getting hairy. You're telling me. Now you'll have a chance to see what these coffee grinders can really do. High tension cables, all through here. Colonel. I think I'd better set it down and see what we can do. Starting up again if there is a wind is murder. How long do you think we'll be? I don't know. Just as long as it takes. Well, I guess I better save the fuel then. (ENGINE SWITCHES OFF) Here. We are 28. From a village of 100. Last night, we took refuge on the church top. Below, there's a woman. Her baby comes too soon, from shock. Pick six or seven of the roughest cases. That's all we can take back. You take care of the others. I'll treat them later. This one can't wait. Okay. Okay. Here we go. By the looks of it, this is the first time for both of us. What are you standing around for? They think we're gonna take them all back. How can I tell them? Now look, I told you to pick the most critical. Look. I can't pick who's gonna live or die. I'm not God. No, you're not God. You're an aircraft commander responsible for this mission. Now pick your people and get them aboard while you've still got an aircraft to command. (BABY CRYING) It's a boy. You mind taking care of the mother, sir? Sure. Steve? Loyal Japanese patriots are dying in battle for need of medical supplies. So then understand that I couldn't in honor give any of this medicine to an enemy. You Japanese! What the hell are you staring at? Get a move on, Takashima. Move! (BABY CRYING) Break the news to them. That's all we can carry. We'll try to get back. That's all. Tell them. Come on. Tell them. We uh... I can't. I can't. Tell them we're taking off now. Our plane can only carry eight people. You have the supplies we've left. We'll make every effort to get back. Go ahead. Tell them. (SPEAKING GERMAN) Well, don't just stand there looking at me. What the hell can we do? They'll all be dead by morning. Couldn't we take at least one more? We can't take one more. Let's go! We're overloaded as it is. All right. Stand back everybody. Stand back. (STARTS ENGINE) Two more trips would do it, sir. Look, Lieutenant, there's 20 people back there. You can carry eight. We've already evacuated the serious cases. Now there's no active need for medical supplies. We can carry 10 each trip. Buddy boy, you have been reading your boy scout manual. Take a look at this weather. It's closing in. You don't really think it's possible to get this chopper up there and back. Even if we only make it once, we save 10 lives. -We lose all 20 if we don't try. -Well, I just can't... You all look like you could use a cup of coffee. Yeah, we could, Miss Caroll. Thanks. I think we'll need it. Because it looks like we're going back. Yes, sir. Hey, Lieutenant! Welcome to the Flying Boy Scouts. Well... Well, I'll stock up on dextran and penicillin and a big load of bouillon cubes. There's no room for you this trip. We're trying to lighten the load to carry more survivors. I only want a one way ticket... To set up a corner drug store and lunch counter. In case you get delayed on that second trip... Okay, Sergeant. Go ahead. Takashima. I, uh... I want to apologize for what happened up there at the church. No sweat, Colonel. It was just something I couldn't... I guess these things run pretty deep. If that's all, sir. I will get the supplies. Yeah, that's all, Sergeant. The landing field's gone. I can find it. Gregg, you're starting an avalanche. The rotors are starting an avalanche. (SCREAMING) I killed them. Cut it out. I killed them all. You're still in command of this chopper, Lieutenant. Take the controls. Listen to me. Take the controls! Take them! Come on. Move. Take 'em. Now fly it! Take it easy, John. Careful now. Watch it. That was a pretty lousy landing, son. Let's take it up and try it again. Yes, sir. Well, come on, let's go. You wanted action, you got it. I killed them all. You're gonna take this thing up. Now. -Oh, no, I can't. -I gave you an order, Lieutenant. Take it up. -I killed them all. -Take it up! I can't! I can't! 294, this is 296. Over! Colonel. Colonel. 296. Go ahead, Stevenson. Stand by, Colonel. I've got a target. Dead ahead. Raft. Crew, from pilot. Put on your Mae Wests. Binoculars, Dennis. Here. I'll take it. Engineer from pilot. Prepare to drop a smoke bomb at 2,000 feet. Find out what kind of a sea we have here. From 060 degrees at 20 knots with a quartering crosswind of 30 knots. All in all. A nice confused sea. Complex sea. Wind wrong. And eight to ten foot swells. Our radio operator hasn't been able to contact any surface craft in the area near enough to pick them up. What does your boy report? I'll let you know. Radio from pilot. Any luck? Report negative, sir. I haven't been able to establish radio contact with any shipping in the area. Keep trying. Cooper, this is Stevenson. We still have negative radio contact. Colonel, I'm gonna drop a MA-1 kit and attempt a landing. Right. Take it easy and good luck. We'll back you up. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Flaps 40. Flaps up. -Sumpter. -Yes, sir. Put down in your log. Captain Cooper crashed into the sea at 1354 hours. Crew, take positions for scanning. Search for possible survivors. Do you see anything, Gregg? No, sir. I don't see anything. Sumpter? Nothing, sir. Garrison? Do you see anything? Nothing of Cooper's plane, sir. Nothing, sir. Dennis, have you been able to raise any surface craft? Negative, sir. No radio contact. General Stevenson, Mike Takashima. Yes. What is it? Sergeant Smith and I request permission to jump, sir. Someone has to show them what that rescue kit is for. Have you figured the risk in jumping and landing in these conditions? Yes, sir. Only... There's just two of us, but twelve of them. All right, it's up to you. What altitude do you want? We'll jump at 1,000 feet, sir. 1,000 will do. He says 1,000 feet. Good luck. -Here, Charlie. -Okay, G.I. -Charlie. -Ok, G.I. Over here. Here. Colonel. This is Garrison. I'm prepared to drop a smoke bomb. If you want to attempt a landing, sir. I'll tell you what I wanna do, when I'm ready. Captain Cooper just had a bad break, sir. I'll decide that, Sergeant. Colonel, this is Sumpter. May I say something? What is it? Well, if it concerns you, sir, I'm sure I speak for the entire crew. We'll be quite willing to attempt a landing. I take that for granted. It seems pretty lousy if Captain Cooper and the others if somehow they got scratched for nothing. Look, son, you just simmer down and do your job. Randy, Randy. Hey, call the radio. -And get Stevenson on the horn. -Okay. 294, over. 294, over. This is Stevenson. Go ahead. Colonel. This is Mike Takashima. The situation here is critical. You'll have to do the best you can. These people need immediate hospitalization. Over. We are trying to make radio contact with shipping. We'll send help as soon as we can. We can't wait for that kind of help. Takashima, you can't save them all. You can't save the whole world. No matter how many I save, I'll always be one short. Nothing has changed in our favor, Sergeant. We'll have no better chance than Cooper. -Colonel? -That's it. These things run deep. MIKE: Do you hear me, Colonel? You said that, these things run deep. Now listen, Takashima and listen good. I will not risk the lives of my crew, just to prove that I don't hate Japanese. Not to you, or myself or anybody else. That's your decision? That's it. That's my decision. First they probably thought there was no hope of being rescued. They just get used to that idea and we show up. To give them back hope. It isn't fair. What do you mean it isn't fair? We just sacrificed seven lives for those Japanese down there. We don't owe those people anything. WOMAN: Don't hate, Steve. Not because of them. Because of what it will do to you. Mark down in the log. Nickel, steel, Manila, and Maria, Christina, Mindanao, May 27th, 1941. Are you Mr. Glenn Stevenson? That's right. They tell me you are shuttling supplies to the earthquake area at Lake Lanao. -I am. -Will you take me down? I don't think those people are in the mood for sight seers at the moment. I'm not a tourist. I'm a newspaper man. And I don't mean, take me down for free. You are a newspaper man? Yes. Well. I didn't know reporters came looking like you. -I also take pictures. -You do, uh? Well, okay, but you better get out of those clothes, and into slacks, that's rough country down there. Where do I unearth a pair of ladies pants around here, Mr. Stevenson? You just wait a minute. Follow me. Tight squeeze, eh? -Here, try these. -(GIGGLING) -Where are you in from? -New York. -I'm Caroline Gordon. -Oh! I knew I hadn't seen you around Manila. I got a lousy memory for names, but I never forget a leg. You peeked. No, I didn't. I looked. Grab a seat and fasten the safety belt. Can I ride with you? I got a ride, I'll meet you back here in a week. I forgot to pay you. That's okay. You will. Caroline! Caroline! You stupid little broad. Where have you been? Hello to you too. I have been looking to hell and gone for you. I have been right here. -At lovely Lake Lanao. -Who is this? I just got adopted by an orphan child. Oh, fine, fine, fine. What... Hey, he is a cute one. Don't you know what can happen to you down here? Floods, earthquakes, epidemics. It's bad enough when you are used to this climate. Why, Mr. Stevenson. You care. Yeah. Hey. Wake up. (WHISTLING) Come to. Wake up. Where is the baby? I gave him to the Red Cross. He is in good hands. Thank you. Why didn't you send word that you were all right? I have been thinking all kinds of things. Have you, Mr. Stevenson? Yes, I have. That was the idea, when I changed into these in front of you. -Huh? -A cheap woman's trick. I see. You know there were times when I was very happy to meet you, Mr. Stevenson. What times? When I tried to get some sleep. I could turn off those kids and turn you on. -You are very nice in my sleep, Mr. Stevenson. -No, no, no. Now, don't go to sleep again. We are going to fly back to Manila now. Do you have a house in Manila? Mmm-hmm. -Are you married? -No. -Are you? -No. I'm glad neither of us is married. So am I. Where is your house? Overlooking the bay. Do you have bougainvillea? All over the place. (LAUGHING) Can I have a hot bath in your house when we get to Manila? You sure can. Come on. How do you come to be in Manila, Mr. Stevenson? I fly airplanes for a living. I know that, but why here? I run the airline. One plane. Any more questions? I'm making small talk because I'm a little bit embarrassed. And I think you should know something about the man whose pajamas you are wearing. I think so too. Anyway, I'm curious to know why a nice American male ends up as a flying beachcomber in the Philippines. I don't know, I just like it here for the moment. I guess I'm a barnstormer. Unreliable type. Are you trying to warn me? Could be. I'll take that drink now. Where do you go from here? Hong Kong. Hong Kong, eh? Why don't you hang around for a while? My plane doesn't leave until noon tomorrow. No, I don't mean just for tonight. We are just beginning to know each other. You know something, Mr. Stevenson. What? You are a nice man. Well, you keep thinking that. I'm a little frightened. The spare bedroom has a key. Just bring my drink. Please don't think I'm trying to act coy. It's just that I'm frightened. Because I have never felt frightened before. I... I don't need that drink now. I'm not frightened any more. Well. I don't know what I have gotten into with this broad. When I said, "Hang around for a while," I meant it, sure. I didn't mean all summer. The trouble is I like it. -Inverters? -Now, don't get me wrong. That's the trap. Off. She knows. She has been around. -Radios? -It's for kicks, hit and run for both of us, a lot of laughs. Off. Shocks? But they are all alike, it's a law of nature. Get the hook in, get married. Settle down. Kids. In place. I got to face it with this broad right now. Especially, after last night. Parking brake? You know how it is sometimes. Get a few drinks. Moonlight. You say anything. -Off. -All switches? Last night was a killer. Phew! Not that I didn't mean it. -Off. -Check complete. Check complete. But this one I got to face right now. Caroline. Lin. Miss Gordon went out on flight 62. She was in a hurry. Flight 62 is the milk run. She won't get to Hong Kong till Friday. She wasn't in a hurry to get to Hong Kong. She was in a hurry to leave Manila. -Can I use your phone? -Yes, sir. Give me the Stevenson hangar, please. Stevenson. That's right. -You're sure it was Flight 62? -Yes, sir. Freckles, roll it out. We are flying to Hong Kong tonight. -Thanks very much. -You are welcome, sir. What took you so long? I can't marry you. I love you. You know, that's what I like about you. You make sense. You don't want a wife, Steve. You don't want roots and kids. -All that routine. -You are beautiful. I'd like to. I'd really like to. -But I just can't. -Why? Why can't you? Okay, here goes. I'm going to have a baby. Well, what do you know? You can back out. So, that's why you ran away. Who wants a bride with a built-in baby? That's it. That's roots. Settling down. Monotony and reliability all in one package. Darling, our roots are in each other. Where ever we are. Together. And our baby won't be roots. He'd be people. And people are portable. -Thank you, father. -Thank you. Good bye, father. Hey, that will do it. That will do it. We'll see you in Manila. (FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING) Good luck. (BOMBS WHISTLING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Yes. Follow me. -Stevenson. -Yes. This is Mrs. Stevenson. -Did you bring the medicine? -No medicine. Here, Stevenson. Steve? Oh, gosh! What took you so long? They kept me in Bilibid, military prisoner. Till they found out, I was just a reserve officer. Didn't know any military secrets. You need a shave. I know. This is Dr. Horton. How are you doing? He helped me. A lot. Darling, I'm so sorry. We'll just have to make another one. We will. It was a boy. We made a son. We'll make a dozen sons. Will we, Steve? She has a high fever. Some infection. Probably puerperal. Do something for her, Doctor. Please. Do something. I'm a doctor without medicines, Mr. Stevenson. Your wife needs hospitalization. Will you stay with her for a while, please? I have no place to go, Mr. Stevenson. Hey! I appreciate your courtesy, Major. Very much. Do you speak English? Yes, Captain. My wife just lost a child. She is running a very high fever. She has to have medicine. Our supplies are extremely limited. Dammit, you have to give me drugs for her. No, I do not have to give you drugs. My wife is dying. All I ask is that you help her. The way any human being would help another. Loyal Japanese patriots are dying in battle for need of medical supplies. Japanese woman and children are asked to sacrifice. Even rice, if necessary. So then, understand that I could not in honor give any of this medicine to an enemy. That is all. (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) I'll get you some water. Here you go. That's a pretty lousy drink you're mixing these days. What would you like? I'll get you anything you want. Something long and cool. Lots of ice in it. And a cigarette. Cigarette? -I think, I know where I can get a cigarette. -No. Don't go now. Please. All right. Don't hate, Steve. Not because of them. Because of what it would do to you. I won't. I'm scared. It's all right. It's all right. Everything is gonna be all... Lin. Lin. (SOBBING) Lin. Oh! CAROLINE'S VOICE: Don't hate, Steve. Don't hate, Steve. Harrison, drop a smoke bomb. Yes, sir. Crew from pilot. Prepare for an open sea landing. Dennis, have you raised Ashiya? No radio contact at all, sir. But I have a commercial pilot on the horn. All right. I'll talk to him. MAN: Pan Am one here. Captain Lee here, bound for Hong Kong. Can I be of any assistance? Will you please contact Hong Kong? Ask them to notify Ashiya rescue. One of our aircraft crashed at sea. We are searching for possible survivors. Roger, will do and, sir, lots of luck. CAPTAIN LEE: Ashiya rescue. This is Ashiya radio. Hong Kong is calling you. This is rescue. Patch me through direct to Hong Kong. MAN: Ashiya rescue. This is Hong Kong. This is Ashiya. Go ahead, Hong Kong. We are relaying a message from air rescue mission, East China sea. One of your aircrafts crashed at sea. They are conducting a search for possible survivors. That is all. Over. Which one? Why didn't they say which one. Hong Kong, this is Ashiya. Request your attempt to contact the rescue plane for the identification of the lost aircraft. Over. Ashiya, this is Hong Kong we will do our best. Listening. Out. There is Gregg's wife. Mrs. Cooper. Judy Victor. That's it, isn't it? No one else has anyone in either aircraft, have they? No, sir. No one else has anyone on either aircraft, I'm sorry, Lu. I feel so darn silly. Eating your heart out about a guy who couldn't care less. Ah, jumpers. Jumpers. They all count jumps. He has jumped 128 times. It's like a game of chicken between him and his little jump guards. Every time I die, la petite mort. That's what the French call love. "A little death." Here is the... Charlie. (YELLING) (YELLING) I know you... Oh. Please sit here. Oh, the ankle? Busted landing in North Africa. Je ne comprends rien, monsieur. Ah, no English. Well, there's no problem, lady. It's okay. I guess everyone understands okay. Oh! No, thank you. I mean, ah, merci. -Merci beaucoup. -De rien, monsieur, vous parlez francais? That's it, baby. You just heard all of it. Donnez-moi votre bras, monsieur. It's you again. That's a crazy ring. Merci beaucoup. You know no matter what I want to say. It's gotta come out merci beaucoup. De rien, monsieur. Well, how about a drink? You know, a drink? Non, merci, monsieur. Why "no"? (SPEAKING FRENCH) -What's all that about? -Grand-pere. So that's what you've been hiding behind that curtain. Yes, sir? Oh, two beers please. Beers? That's impossible, sir. Because your lady is Arab, alcohol is not permitted. Oh, well, thanks, pally, make it two coffees. Two coffees, yes. Oh, where did you get that crazy face? -Poof? -Yeah, that's me. Regiment francais? That's right. Now you've got the whole picture. Broken down lend-lease paratrooper assigned to demolitions with the French regiment. Oh, that face. Merci, monsieur. Hey! You can't leave me now. Monsieur. Merci. Can I be of service to you, sir? You could do me a favor. -Do you speak French? -Why, naturally. Would you tell the young lady that my name is Mike Takashima. And I would like to know her name. But, monsieur, I don't think... Well... Monsieur voudrait savoir votre nom, mademoiselle. Il s'appelle Mike Takashima. De rien. Michel? "Michel." Well, I never thought of it that way. Je m'appelle Leila. Leila... Michel. Leila. What can I do for you, sir? Oh, I would like some information. Would you ask her if she might know where there is a beach. (TRANSLATES IN FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) The young lady says that it so happens she's on her way to the beach. She'll be happy to take you there. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Monsieur, can I interest you in a pair of... Hello, Michel. It wasn't just that face you were keeping under wraps. Je ne comprends pas. Don't try to understand. We're on the magic carpet. Just don't try to understand. Can you imagine such a thing happening to me. Mike Takashima. Father Japanese, mother Polish. And somehow I come to North Africa. And find you. Oh, I am not going to try to understand anything either. (CHUCKLES) Okay, I understand, time to go. Now, where do we eat dinner? -Non, Michel. -But you have to eat, no? -Non. -Well, why not? (SPEAKING FRENCH) Ma famille. "Famille"? Family? That crazy ring. Look, you're not married? -Marriage? -Mariage? (LAUGHS) -Non, Michel. -Oh, baby, I like that "non, Michel" a lot better than the others. Maman, papa, grand-pere... Okay, baby, comprends. But when do I see you again? I can't let you go now. Once you put that mask on, I'll never find you again. -Michel, je suis tres en retard. -No. How do the flyboys say? Rendezvous... When do we rendezvous? Rendez-vous? Uh, how to explain this? I come into town only on weekends. Now, next weekend. Now, look, twice around the clock means tomorrow. Tomorrow, ici, la plage. No, no. No. Tomorrow, tomorrow, seven tomorrows. Next week. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow... Right. Right. The time. What time? (REPLIES IN FRENCH) 10:00. Okay, baby. You got yourself a date. Mais oui, the world grows smaller. In war time even smaller. The customs of one carve the customs of another. And so as you say, on the street she wears the bed sheet, on the beach she wears a fig leaf. But, take my advice. Don't be a sucker, monsieur. (CHUCKLES) -"Sucker." -Mais oui. Don't be fooled by the fig leaf or by your defiance of grandpapa. With this girl, there is not a chance, monsieur. Not a chance. Very old Arab family here. Very proud. I know this one. If it is pleasure you want, monsieur, that I can arrange for you. Next time you come into town, I... No, thanks, pal. I've got a date with a mirage in a fig leaf. At 10:00, next Saturday morning. Hey! Hold it! There's that crazy ring. How do you say "sucker" in French? Leila! (SPEAKING FRENCH) I'm sorry, pal. Oui, monsieur... Pally, I need your help. Oh, how nice, monsieur. And what type do you prefer? No, no, I want that girl, Leila. Are you out of your mind? She's not of that sort, I told you. Just tell me where she lives, that's all. Now I could not do that. It's a very old family. Regular customers. My job... How much? Well, you could never find the way alone. Just tell the taxi driver where to take me. Come on, give a sucker an even break. Come on. (INAUDIBLE) I'm looking for Leila. Are you Leila's mother? Oh, please, it's important. I have to talk to her. Leila, is she... Leila... Where is she? Tell Leila rendezvous important. (SPEAKING FRENCH) MIKE: No, no, you don't understand. The troops are leaving very soon. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Michel... Michel... Oh, Leila. Oh, Leila, where have you been? Michel. Cher Michel... I love you, Leila. Je vous aime. Je vous aime aussi, Michel. Je t'aime. Je t'adore. I love you. You do? You do love me. Maybe someday we'll do that. Together we'll go everywhere. Italy. Italy. France. Oui, Michel, la France. Spain. L'Espagne. America. L'Amerique, toi? Japan. -Le Japon. -I'd like to see that too. And then... Then we'll come back here and build a house. A crazy big house. Just for us to live in. You and me. Michel... We're going to be married. Now, look, the troops will be moving out any time, any day. I want to marry you right now. Comprends? (SPEAKING FRENCH) Why not? Why not? (SPEAKING FRENCH) Non. We have to talk about it. Now, come. -Now, what? -I need your help. Please, tell her we're going to be married right away. (SPEAKING FRENCH) It is quite impossible as she says. We'll make it work, baby. Tell her I'll do anything to make it work. (TRANSLATES IN FRENCH) Please put some more feeling into it. Pretend you're selling a tie or something. (SPEAKING FRENCH) I'll take up Arab citizenship. (SPEAKING FRENCH) She's quite right, you know. Your people will never accept it, nor hers. But we're not marrying people, we're marrying each other. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Muslim, Muslim, Michel. My father was a Buddhist, my mother a Seventh-day Adventist. Does she love me... That's all, that's all that matters. Monsieur, you're breaking the glass. (SPEAKING SOFTLY IN FRENCH) The young lady loves you very dearly. She wants you to understand that. But it can never be. That's why she did not come to see you last weekend. And this is what she came to tell you today. Voila. (EXPLOSIONS) MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA: Attention! Attention! All who wish to be evacuated, report back immediately. An enemy squadron of bombers has destroyed our garrison and will return. Everyone else should remain in their houses. Repeat. Remain in your houses. Attention! Attention! -Wait for me, pally. -Okay. (ANNOUNCEMENT CONTINUES) Leila! Leila! I know you can hear me. We're leaving now. But I'll be back. Listen, wait for me. You must wait for me. Wait for me. (EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE) For God's sake, let me know you can hear me. (HONKING) I love you, baby. Je t'aime. Je t'aime. (WHISTLING) Non. Non. This will hold them up for a while. Michel. Michel. Get down. Down. Get down! (YELLING) How many times today do I have to save your life? -Okay, Charlie? -Okay, G.I. Before landing checklist.
