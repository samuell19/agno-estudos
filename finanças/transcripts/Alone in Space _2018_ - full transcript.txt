Hello from the children of planet Earth. - Momma, tell me about the gold disc. - Of Voyager? Okay. A long, long time ago, long before you were born ... NASA sent out a space probe called Voyager. On the spacecraft, there was an audio disc of gold. The gold disc? - Yes, and on it was all of Earth's sounds. All languages, even baby talk and animal noises and music. Chuck Berry was on it. Go, Johnny, go! Woof, vovv, woof, woof! Miaow! Hello. Hoping that someone out there in infinite space would find Voyager. And maybe look us up and try to understand us. So while you and I are here ... Voyager is whizzing around up there somewhere. - Bye, Voyager. Good luck. - Good luck. Alone in Space. Now you sleep. Will anyone find it? Found. Sleep tight. Try counting sheep or something, honey. One two three four... five, six, seven ... I loved mother's stories about space. But I did not think I would be traveling in it six years later. 96, 97, 98... 99, hundred! I am coming now! Keaton? Keaton! Where are you? Where are you? Yes! Help me! Down here! Hello! - Keaton? - Help me, Gladys! Help me! Yes, help, hurry up then! What are you doing?! Gladys, I'm sorry. I lost all the parts. Everything can change. You think you are prepared for everything. Then suddenly, you are alone in space. For six years, we have traveled from Earth to the planet Vial, our new home. The spacecraft Svea was built for thousands of passengers. But now it's just us. Me and my little brother, Keaton. In the beginning we were three. Mom was also on board. But she tried to save us and disappeared. - Oh, that was outstanding. - Keaton longs for mom. He hopes she will come back. I long for Vial, humanity's hope. Dagfas, nattfas, day and night. Just me and Keaton. Alone in an eternity. And Otosan. The Japanese on board computer. Good morning, Otosan. Otosan, how many days it is until we get there? Always the same. Gladys, it's always the same. - Can you fix it? - There is something wrong with the clock. Count the number of passengers, thanks. A child, two children ... No Speedy. Otosan, Speedy file, please. Here is my nice little momma and my sweet little brother Keaton. Hello, Keaton. Hey, baby. He was born here in Svea. A real space baby. - Don't film now, Gladys. Turn it off. - I want to film! I promise we'll play, but not now. Don't film now, please. Crew of Svea XVI, turn around! Speedy file again, please. Here is my nice, little mom and my sweet little brother Keaton. Hello, Keaton. Hey, baby. He was born here in Svea. A real space baby. - I miss Speedy. - I know. When will she come back? Soon. Really soon. Crew of Svea XVI, turn around! You are have stolen military property! Sometimes I think of the time before. I'm the only one who remembers. Turn around! Do you also miss Speedy? Not as much as you. Don't film now, please. You have stolen military property! Turn around! - Do you have to stare at that? - Yes, I do. - She's your "mother," not "Speedy." - She is called "mother" and "Speedy." (Otosan) Gladys? Can you hear me? Hello, hello, hello! Do you hear me? It's Keaton. - Can you hear me? -As usual: call only in an emergency. Okay then. - See if you can find some candy. -Roger. Hello? Hello? I cannot hear you. Once we were on Earth, but now we are here. Nothing can happen in reverse. Time ... it just goes in one direction. The only thing I have left from earth ... ... is mom's favorite song, "Johnny B. Goode." ("Johnny B. Goode" - Chuck Berry) Keaton wants to save mother with a little spaceship. I ... I'm just trying to pass the time. (Otosan) I sometimes dream about Mom. Of the time before. Of sleeping in my own bed at home - on Planet Earth. - (Otosan) - Ai! I cut myself. What do you want? I'm bleeding everywhere. I did not steal! There's no one to steal from! Okay. I'll just keep these two. Candy, chocolate. - Otosan, what happened? - Gladys! - Gladys! - Keaton! Keaton, are you okay? Respond! Gladys! Keaton! Otosan! What's happening? Otosan! You have to help me! Otosan, monitors, please. Gladys. Open, Keaton! Gladys. What happened? I'm scared. - Something collided with us. - Otosan, what happened? It was just some space debris. Only worse than usual. It's OK. - Tell me about Speedy again. - Okay. Mom went to look for an asteroid in space. Because it had important metal on it. Then she got lost. Now she tries to find a way back home to us. - But she will soon? - Yes she will. Do you hear? It is very quiet everywhere. That's because you're used to it, brat. Listen. Nothing, it's just quiet. Here there are maybe 20 different sounds. But on Earth ... There were millions and billions. The wind, all languages. The sea. And birds. - But ... I like our 20 sounds. - Me too. Finish it like Speedy did. - She did so every night? - Yes. Now I have to look at Otosan. Everything broke down, everything on the Earth. Right? And all the others, those who are left behind, the dogs? I do not know. One can not think about it all the time. Come on, help me build my ship. You can fix the wing. The forest and the sea, there is nothing left. The people are gone. Earth is empty. Gladys! Come! Come on, let's go inside. The situation is untenable. We appeal to the public for help. People are fleeing from their homes and gathering in the tent camps. Everything would have been different if people hadn't destroyed the Earth. If the Svea project goes according to plan. Evacuation of the Nordic countries will take place in two years. Your passports will determine if you are selected to join the evacuation. But Momma had been building Svea. She had a plan that would save us. Gladys! Otosan - he is working again! Otosan, count the number of passengers. Otosan, Speedy file. Otosan, food, breakfast! OTOSAN, water. No food, no water. - It's on the ship. Do not be afraid. - I'm hungry. - I'll get it. - No, do not go! - How do we get it then? - I do not know! (Voices) Gladys? Gladys? (Noise) - Gladys, what was that? - Shhh. (Noise) - Wait. Can't we just stay here? - Follow me. I can tie your shoes. No never. I can tie my own shoes. - Show me then. - Not now. I'll be back soon. (sound) Gladys? Otosan, what was that? Hello? Is anybody here? (sound) Otosan, answer. What was that noise? (sound) Otosan, is it safe there? Otosan. How many of people on the ship? Count the number of passengers, please. One two... Speedy! (Cracking and Wind) Has Speedy come back? If she has, you have to open. Please? (Door opens) Thanks. Speedy? Mother? Mother? (Ape sound) Otosan, open up! That's not Speedy! Hello? Hello? Yoo-hoo! Uäääh! Get away from me! Otosan, gender. (Ape noise) It's just me. What's going on? I do not know. It's in there. Look. - Come come. - No! No no no. - What is that? - I do not know. (Ape noise) (Whining moans) (snores) - What is that? A monster? - No. - Gladys? - It is okay. What are you doing here? (Ape Noise) Uäääh! Are you hungry? - No! It's my candy! - Relax, he needs food. - That ugly old man is not getting my candy! - Namnam. What is it doing? (Nasty sound) Greetings from a programmer in the university town of Ithaca ... ... On the planet Earth. What did you do? You are ... alone in space. You are just a child. Do you understand what I'm saying? Vojajer. Vojajer ...? Vojajer. His name is Vojajer? Is that your name? - Namnam? - No, my name is Gladys. - And that's Keaton. - Katon. Not Cat-On. Keaton! (Swedish word for)Roof! Where are you from? We come from Earth. - Home. - And we're going to Vial. Planet Earth. - Vial. - Going home, the planet Earth? Don't you understand that we can not go home? You can not be here. Piss off, old man. Aaah! Have you harmed yourself? So have I. I can help you. Same. Ojojaj. Problemo? Whatta, whatta? I-I, my, my, aye. Problem. That is very nice. "The Sounds of Earth." - Earth? - Home. - The Gold Disc with all the sounds! - What are you doing? You found it! You found the Voyager. - Mom always told us about all the sounds. - He found Voyager. - It is absolutely amazing. - He said it wrong. Don't you understand how big that is? That someone would find it was almost impossible. - Home. - Home. Do you know where Speedy is? Speedy. - Keaton, stop. - He isn't named after the space probe ...! You can see he doesn't even know what it says. Relax. You need not be afraid. It's OK. You're with us now. You need not be afraid. It is not with us. You and I are with us. - Now he takes my candy too. - It is clear that he must take the candy. Namnam! What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Now you are scared, huh? Keaton! Wait, do not go! We'll come back when you have calmed yourself. Come on. We'll pick up my backpack. Do not worry about Keaton. He'll get used to you. - Oops! Oops. - Jump ... oops. It does not matter. This is the mess hall. Here, people would eat. - Namnam. - Yes, namnam. Gently! So that you do not cut yourself. It's sharp. Come, let's go! Here is the sports hall, I think. And there it was probably thought that people would live. Here is the ship's lung. Where the formation of oxygen takes place. Here's the airlock. Here I float around sometimes. Weightless. It was scary at first. Once I threw up. Have you ever seen weightless vomit? You should try it sometime. Not the throwing up, but ... weightlessness. Bye. - Why "goodbye?" - Come on, let's go. Bye. Otosan, why is Voyager here? What? What do you mean? I do not understand. Is he dangerous? This is the journey to Vial. Or ... well ... that round thing, blue thing, that's Vial. It's just a painting, but ... Not home. Not yet. No, not yet, but ... Your people have a bad reputation out here. Turn around. What? You will never get there. - You never have time to catch up. - Catch up? Space grows. You should not be out here. What do you mean, "space grows?" - Turn around. - We can not. Earth is dead. It is dead. Do you know? Are you sure? I do not know. Earth may live. What if the Earth is alive? Space is no where. Wrong place for home. There is no Vial. Otosan, how long is it until we arrive? Gladys, where have you been? - It's always the same. - I know, there is something wrong with it. No, there's nothing wrong. It's for real. We can ask Speedy when she comes back. Otosan, change course! - Change the direction! - But it can not change direction. - Turn back to Earth! - It can not change direction! Gladys? Roof? Here you are. Namnam! Have you spit on it? Aargh! Creep! Yes. I was ju ... Plug. They understand enough. They're just kids. Not dangerous. Please, do not come here. I can communicate with them now. I'll send you what you need. Learn what is called "Swedish." Learn Swedish? - Yes, exactly, you will understand. - You know your place and your mission. - Do you need help? - No, you have to listen! Come to you? No. No, do not come here. Leave us alone. Come. Come on. - Are you okay? - Yes. You're tough. Here. (Music: "Johnny B. Goode") It's not dangerous. Okay? Mom was wrong. It was dangerous. Escape from Earth was not fair. Only a few would go to Vial. Only a few would be saved. Most would not. - Petra Karlsson? - Yes. - Kristoffer Arvedal? - Yes. - David Pettersson? - Yes. - Lisa Lerian? - Here. Maria Nebolah? - Maria Nebolah? - Yes, here. Mother? Your name's not Mary. We would be (saved), at any cost. Johan? Look at this. - Come on! - She took the card! - Mom! What are you doing? - Run! No! Stop! Get her now! - Get her! - Look out! - Hurry up. - Mom, where are we going? Hurry! Sit still. The ship has no crew, stop! - Mom. - You must not start the ship! That's an order! - Evacuate the platform! - You can not do this! Good morning. Time for work, brat. Rise and shine now. - What are you doing? - Come and help. - Come on. - Are you fixing Otosan? No, I am accessing the trip computer so we can go to Earth. - To the Earth? But what about Vial? - We will not reach Vial. - Yes. - No. You know the numbers? 8400? There is nothing wrong, it's true. Space is growing faster than we move. - You can't change Otosan's course. - I don't care. I want to go home. - This is my home. I was born here. - I'm the oldest and I decide. - I know things you do not know. - What are the things I do not know? - Nothing. - What do you mean "nothing?" Tell me! You're not the oldest. Speedy decides. I decide for Svea. Not you, not Otosan and not Speedy. Hello! Speedy! Speedy, can you hear me? Speedy! Speedy! Speedy! Hello? Stop! For real! Don't you see that she will never answer? - Keaton. -Otosan? What is it? What do you mean? I'm going to die? If I don't beat Voyager? I do not want to. I love you too. Pe ... ehh ... - What is it? - No ... Gladys. Eh... - There are ... others ... like ... - What "others?" Others who ... I. The ... Your family? If they want to come and visit sometime, it would be great fun. I like guests. And Keaton will get used to it. Guests? The motherboard! Yes. Friends ... all ... Otosan's hard drive! We can control the phases. Good Start. (Laughing) What is he doing? Dancing disco? Yes. - Whatta? - He knows what he must do. Yes, I do not know, I ... (Snoring) No, do not come here. They're just ... children. Otosan, I cannot. Are you sure? What has happened? What are you doing? What have you done? It's dangerous. Otosan told me to kill the monster. - He's bleeding! - He told me. He said my name. - Who told you? - He said: "Keaton, kill the monster!" - You do not even understand what he says. - Well, he said my name! No, no, stop! What are you doing, Gladys? Stop! Look out, Otosan! Otosan, the Speedy file! Here is my nice, little mother. Mother ... Hello, Keaton. Hey, baby. He was born here in Svea. Speedy is coming back soon. Then everything will be fine. Right? No. - Yes. - No. She's never coming back. She has been missing for too long. Do you think you would survive if you stepped out into space? There is a clip you've never seen. Mom was a hero. She went to fix everything, but she disappeared. You were there. You were. I do not believe that. She was going to the asteroid. You said that. My ship then? We could go and rescue her with it. - Mom ... - Here, take this. Please come back. Everything can be changed. You think you've prepared for everything. I will soon. Then you are alone in space. Voyager, you are alive! - You are alive. - It was so cold. I saw a light. I will tend to you. Come on. I'll help you with the wound. It is okay. You only got a bump. (Laughing) Keaton. Come down. Roof? Roof? Roof, ho-ho! Roof? A spaceship! What's happening? - They're here. - What is this? Guests. Whatta! Whatta, whatta! Ahumba! Whatta, jump. Komsi, Komsi. - Bomma-grandmother. - Bomma. - Whatta. - Kasika. - They found me. - Your family? - Your family? - I was supposed to catch you ... I was supposed to catch you and take you to them. - What are they doing here? - They hate. They hate people. They make them prisoners. (radio static) Whatta, whatta. Do you hear me? Attention, people. Surrender voluntarily. Give up! Open the door! The Bar-Bar! - Check. Fine data. - What? No. Focus! Have they been following all this time? - Why did not you say something? - I ... I said "guests." When you said "guests," I did not think you meant the kind that kills. We have to hide. - I have to go to them. - No! We like Voje, so you can go to hell! Do you hear me, homos? Fuck off! Sorry, Voje. I don't mean you. I mean those homos. - Keaton? - They probably did not even know what I said. - Wha? Bar. - Yes! - What should we do? - I know! If we can control the phases, we should be able to control the doors too. Are they close? Near. How close? Very close. - Thanks, I noticed. - You're welcome, you're welcome. You take care of the doors, and I'll talk to Gladys. Gladys? - Are you ready? - Yes. Whatta. Whatta. Bomma-bomma! - The doors - now! - Now. - We got them. - Yeah, we got them! Be careful, Gladys! Do not shoot! - Door 4 - now! - Now! Voje, we got him! Get loose! Get loose ... - No! - Get loose, get loose. - There. - I know! Min pickadolla! Bomma! - Okay, Keaton, it's our last chance now. - Okay then, we're ready. Little man. - Now! - Now! Did we do it right? - Let me go! - Where are you? Hello! - Hey! - Look out, Gladys! What are you doing? No! Stop! - Wait! - Help! Okay, yes, yes, yes, yes. - Shit, I couldn't. - Gladys, what happened? It did not work. They are too strong. What should we do? They are there outside. (bang) - Stop! - The game is over. Give up! Give up! - Let me. - No no. Can we talk about this? They're just kids, they are not dangerous. What? Are you stupid? Mollycoddler! It was wrong of us to send you. (barks) What are you doing? - Whatta, whatta. - Kokobello. - Take this shiny shit. - Thank, thank you. Vojo! Where were we? Give me the laser. Give it to me. Thanks. Ole dole, doff. Loading ... laddi ... Whatta? Whatta?! Keaton, get behind me. - Gladys, do something! - Vojo! No! Run! Whatta, whatta. Whatta, whatta. Hide now. I'll trick them. - No, wait, do not go! - Keaton. I would never leave you. You're the best I know, brat. Hey, homos! Take me, then! I will take you, you little ... Little friend. Buddy. Friend. Friends. Children. Whatta, whatta! Ho-hoo! Whatever. Whatta. Hello? Come here. Whatta. Bomma-bomma. Whatta. Whatta. Help, Gladys! Help me! Keaton? Keaton! Hm, what this is? Bag. Yes, yes, yes, yes. What? Hello? As if, as though. Comma, comma. No! Hurry up, Keaton! - It's coming! - Come on! Come here, come! Vojo! Hey Voje! Voje, do not die. My ship. We never had time to finish building it. If we had, we could escape now. Keaton. There is one ... ... more ship. Guests. The monster's ship? Every day we say: "I hope." "I hope I get to see my mother." "That I get to sleep in my own bed." "That nothing bad happens." But sometimes it is more important to dare than to hope. Sometimes you just have to do something about it. Otherwise, things fall apart. Voyager found the golden disc, against all odds. It brought us together. Momma had loved it once. Me, Keaton and Voyager. Our journey is not over. We'll go home, home to Earth. Together. Oh thank you. Gladys. Trust yourself. You know what to do. - Lets go home. - To Earth? - Can we fix it? - We can try. - You get this. Here. - Thanks. Go home. Hold on now, brat.
