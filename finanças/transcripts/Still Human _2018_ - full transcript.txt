The pay is higher, and the workload should be less Thanks, but I'm good Why? It's not difficult to change employers How should I put it?

Evelyn, you don't have to be so nice We are here just to work They always say "We treat you like family" But do they really think so?

Remember I told you about Carmen? She used to work for a middle-class family She married a white banker. Now she lives in the mid-levels Richer than her previous boss And she has her own maid! You've said this many times before We don't even know if this Carmen exists Evelyn, if we work hard, we can be "Carmen" too I don't want to be Carmen. I just want to be myself Many terrible things can happen in a relationship that lacks love Without love, he can hit you simply because he's not happy He can make you liable to all his debts He can force you to give up on your dreams I don't want to get into a relationship without love again If the person I love loves me the same He doesn't need to give me anything I'd rather accomplish what I want to do on my own Yes, I agree Although my husband is not rich, I'm happy with him Now I just want to take care of my own children instead of someone else's Well, for me... I just hope that when I go back some day My husband and son won't treat me as a stranger But can you accept that our children will grow up... To be the maids of those girls' children? We have to make changes Out of 100 poor women, maybe only 1 can succeed on her own I don't have any talents, I can only think of getting a reliable man 1 out of 100 I don't know if we're that one woman But we're definitely within the 100! Cheers! Today we are no different than them We all can dance! Let's dance! "Wang Chun-yin - Busy" Dad, why are you calling so late? Son, did I wake you?
