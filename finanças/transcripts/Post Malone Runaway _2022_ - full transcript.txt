Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. My name is Austin Richard Post. I sold this bitch out two nights, Daddy, and opened up... opened new seats. ♪ I feel you crumble in my arms ♪ We're gonna look back on this in 50 years and we're gonna say this is the new generation of rock. Y'all are fuckin' rockstars and nobody can tell ya shit. On stage, there's no band, it's just him. When you see the growth of a performer who you already thought was a star, then them taking it to a whole other level. People love him. I fuckin' kissed his hand! Play that shit! There's often a moment in an artist's career that really defines them. Right now, Post on this Runaway Tour is having that moment. I'm watching this guy that I've known complete the first leg of an arena tour and be one of the biggest selling artists of our generation. Let's make a song with Post and Ozzie together. None of it's normal. Hey, I call it what I see it. Greatness is greatness. ♪ Take what you want ♪ I'm just a guy doing my best at something that he loves to do.

There's an incredible amount of pressure that's felt by the entire team to execute every show at a very, very high level. And those shows in less than a year went from playing amphitheaters to arenas and stadiums. You can't deny him anymore. He's real. You really can't say he's not here to stay. ♪ I just keep on hopin' that you call me ♪ You're nobody till you play MSG. It's just a mind-blowing thing to be able to go to, like, one of the most renowned music venues where literally everybody, like, all your heroes have played. ♪ We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go ♪ ♪ Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home ♪ - Here we go. Let's get it. - All right. Yeah. Tour's always an interesting thing because you can either be ready or you can't be ready. You gotta get pumped up before. You know, you go on the road for months at a time. How was the drive down here? It was beautiful, good. No traffic, no accidents. Everybody's safe. That's a beautiful ride. I don't care how long it takes as long as we safe. How is it driving for Post? This is my second tour with him. I've been around a lot of artists. I've been out here 30 years doing this shit. Thirty years driving some of the best artists, but he's special. Like a family, yeah? Oh, yeah, definitely like a family. - London Lounge. - London Lounge? Fuck. Fuck! - Straight from South London. - South London, innit? Man don't... Man don't... Man don't hang around Kensington. It's not man's end. Dre, he just believed in me ever since the start. He knows what's really going on. Man'll make moves. Get out of my way. Move. The first time I ever heard Post was in 2014. I was like, "Wow." He was playing the guitar. He was like 18, 19 years old. It sounded like an old man, like old man tone. Like, I couldn't explain it. Like, it was just next level. I was like, "Yo, how the fuck am I gonna get the whole world to hear this?" Nothing else to it. I just wanted to know how I'm gonna get the whole world to hear him. As you can see, I figured it the fuck out. ♪ We couldn't turn around ♪ ♪ Till we were upside down ♪ ♪ I'll be the bad guy now ♪ ♪ But no, I ain't too proud ♪ ♪ I couldn't be there ♪ ♪ Even when I tried ♪ ♪ You don't believe it ♪ ♪ We do this every time ♪ ♪ Seasons changed and our love went cold ♪ ♪ Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go ♪ ♪ Run away, but we're running in circles ♪ ♪ Run away, run away ♪ ♪ I dare you to do something ♪ ♪ I'm waiting on you again ♪ ♪ So I don't take the blame ♪ ♪ Run away, but we're running in circles ♪ ♪ Run away, run away, run away ♪ ♪ Let go ♪ ♪ I got a feeling that it's time to let go ♪ ♪ I say so ♪ ♪ I knew that this was doomed from the get-go ♪ ♪ You thought that it was special, special ♪ ♪ But it was just the sex though, the sex though ♪ ♪ And I still hear the echoes, the echoes ♪ ♪ I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go ♪ ♪ Seasons changed and our love went cold ♪ ♪ Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go ♪ ♪ Run away, but we're running in circles ♪ ♪ Run away, run away ♪ In the song, we're saying you run away, but you're running in circles. The Runaway Tour is almost, like, you know, indicative of that line where it's kind of like he's a runaway train. There's no stopping him. No one has control over him but him. So I think that's kind of the symbolism. Essentially, you know, the studio bus was a great idea. A place where you could always go to work, a little sanctuary-type deal. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Kind of just make some different shit in the vibe of tour. Working with Post, like, sessions, they're so whimsical. They can kind of be anything and you kind of don't know until you dive in. 'Cause we could switch the melodies if you've got the lyrics. It is probably better to get his feel on it. Post is an amazing writer on his own, but I think, like, he enjoys the collaborative process. I don't think this... I don't think this first part needs guitar. Ultimately, he's the filter. He's got great taste and he knows what he wants. Yeah, this should go two times. There should be no words yet. No words yet. Hi-hats when the vocals come in. In the same way that I feel like his music is a natural expression of himself, his audience's, like, attachment to the music is as natural because it's like... I think that you can really feel in his music that... who he is. The songs, I guess, are what they are and I am who I am. I wanna make this music for everybody else, but everybody else supporting the music gives me the same feeling back, which is incredible. My name is Austin Richard Post and I just wanna say thank you to each and every single one of y'all for coming out tonight. ♪ You prolly think that you are better now, better now ♪ ♪ You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, I would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ You prolly think that you are better now, better now ♪ ♪ You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ You know I say that I am better now, better now ♪ ♪ I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ I seen you with your other dude ♪ ♪ He seemed like he was pretty... ♪ ♪ I was so broken over you ♪ ♪ Life, it goes on, what can you do? ♪ ♪ I just wonder what it's gonna take, ayy ♪ ♪ Another foreign or a bigger chain, ayy ♪ ♪ Because no matter how my life has changed, ayy ♪ ♪ I keep on looking back on better days ♪ ♪ You prolly think that you are better now, better now ♪ ♪ You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, I would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ You know I say that I am better now, better now ♪ ♪ I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ I promise, I swear to you ♪ ♪ I'll be okay ♪ ♪ You're only... ♪ ♪ The love of my life ♪ Sing that shit! ♪ Better now, better now ♪ ♪ You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, I would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ You know I say that I am better now, better now ♪ ♪ I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around ♪ ♪ You know I never meant to let you down, let you down ♪ ♪ Would've gave you anything, would've gave you everything ♪ ♪ Oh-oh ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ He doesn't have a genre. He doesn't need a genre. How many stories have you heard of record labels saying to the artist, "You know, you can't make that kind of song or that kind of song, you have to have a sound, you have to have that"? He shattered that concept. You know, we carry the equipment with us on tour, so there's a room designated to that. Just being on guitar and... Being loud with our drums, being loud with the guitar, the lead singer, microphone, speakers. Even before the show, he might've did a damn private show for hisself and, like, a couple of his homies. Two, three, four. Fuck! He opened my world of music up from using bands that I don't even know how he knows them 'cause he's younger than me, but he was telling me about the Dead Kennedys and, like, his knowledge of music is, like, insane. He's like a encyclopedia of music. It's one thing that... I was always, like, impressed with him. A lot of people nitpick genres like, "Oh, this isn't metal. This is, like, sludge metal or doom metal" or anything like that. But I mean, at the end of the day, it's music and if you like it, then you like it. Post is influenced by so many things he was listening to... Slayer and Metallica and Biggie and 'Pac and Wu-Tang... And you take all those influences and put them in a kid that loves music, they're naturally gonna have instincts to be able to rap and sing and play guitar and do this and do that. So I think it's kind of, like, all these different things together that make him Post Malone. You can't really put a genre. The place Post holds, when we look back at the history of music, he contributed to the decategorization of music and how powerful that is. No genre. no category, no... no walls that box you in. Every time I hear his music, I'm actually surprised that it's him again. You can tell that he has, like, a real diverse, eclectic love of music. I mean, he done played everything in there tonight. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. And I think that comes through in his music. He's in there being him, no shoes on, no socks on, beer pong, in his world, playing trap, playing rock. So now he's just choosing what channel he wanna turn to, but he's always been turning back and forth to all those channels and that's why the merge of that is something special. What are you telling me, playboy? Hey, what up, baby. Miami, we here. You have the bottle, but just one person. - Two people. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One on stage. One on stage. - One on stage. - One on stage, one behind. And then your voice, like you singing this shit. Yeah. People don't be singing no more. Like, you singing that shit. See, man, you make me feel so happy. No, man. Hey, I call it what I see it. Greatness is greatness. And I just like to be a part of all greatness from every generation, including from my generation to this generation. I'm like, I only see not a lot of... There's good stuff, but not a lot of great stuff. This is great. Just trying my best, man. Trying to keep up. It's up to your boy to keep up. You got that. Hey, you're Lewis Hamilton. Rock music almost sonically got to a point where it could only be so loud, but hip hop is what he grew up listening to. "Rockstar" was, like, at that moment, I think he felt like rap was kind of the new rock, you know, and it was about rebellious music. It was whatever music you could turn up and piss your parents off. You ready? It's not just traditional rockstars anymore. You know, it's just kind of, like, the attitude that comes with it. That's always came with it. I'm gonna be myself and I'm gonna express myself anyway. And if you don't like it, fuck you. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies ♪ ♪ Man, I feel just like a rockstar ♪ ♪ All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta ♪ ♪ Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man, them the shottas ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, when my homies pull up on your block ♪ ♪ They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta ♪ ♪ Ooh, shit, hey, switch my whip, came back in black ♪ ♪ I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" ♪ ♪ Close that door, we blowin' smoke ♪ ♪ She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, act a fool on stage ♪ ♪ Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, shit was legendary, threw a TV out the window of the Montage ♪ ♪ Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn ♪ ♪ Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryin' to get in ♪ ♪ Sayin', "I'm with the band" ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Now she actin' outta pocket, tryin' to grab up on my pants ♪ ♪ Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man ♪ ♪ And they all brought a friend ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies ♪ ♪ Man, I feel just like a rockstar ♪ ♪ All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta ♪ ♪ Hey, hey ♪ ♪ Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man, them the shottas ♪ ♪ Damn, hey, when my homies pull up on your block ♪ ♪ They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta ♪ ♪ I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars ♪ ♪ Feelin' like a pop star ♪ ♪ 21, 21, 21 ♪ ♪ Drinkin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool ♪ ♪ And they ain't got on no bra ♪ ♪ What ♪ ♪ Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks ♪ ♪ And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" ♪ They like, "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage and you only got six cars?" ♪ I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? ♪ ♪ Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack ♪ ♪ Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks ♪ ♪ L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" ♪ ♪ Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car ♪ ♪ Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard ♪ ♪ I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard ♪ ♪ Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar ♪ ♪ Hey, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies ♪ ♪ Man, I feel just like a rockstar ♪ ♪ All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a Rasta ♪ ♪ Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi and show up, man, them the shottas ♪ ♪ When my homies pull up on your block, they make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta ♪ We were at Quad Studios in New York and we just kind of were fucking around. As soon as that beat came out and there was the vocals there and then the whole shit just came back in. I thought that was pretty damn awesome. It was a strike of lightning. There's a freedom to it. It's like, we don't care what you think. We're just gonna be ourselves. It's either you're with it or you ain't and if you're not, I don't give a shit. You know what I mean? If you watch him perform, I mean, he's a rockstar. The guy literally just controls an entire audience of people and he lives that life. Guys, make it quick. Let's go. I love slamming brews and going nuts. It's the best. How the fuck y'all feeling, Miami? God damn! Tonight might be the most fun I've had in a long time. If you're having fun, people can tell that you're having fun and they'll have a good time too. I'm fucked up and there is at least one million dollars US cash on the floor right now. Hot daddy!

Can I have another brewski? God damn. Thank you very much. Despite everything that everybody was saying about Post and us getting ready to do arenas, a lot of people didn't think we could do it from the beginning. You know, there was always questions that you're not a strong enough artist. It's rough sometimes mentally. You know, just sometimes I feel like I'm not a real person. I got cameras on me all the God-damn time. How many times you need to film this? Probably filmed it 30 fucking times by now. - Easily. - What's the fucking difference? It's bizarre. Sometimes I'll be shopping in a store and there'll be, like, a group of people just recording me while I'm just, like, you know, walking around. And it's just like had you come up and just asked for a picture, you know, that would be... would be better for me, you know, as opposed to just, like, kind of, like, spying. It just feels like I never get any privacy, you know? No one's ever lived his life. Even you could go back to Elvis and say, "Well, Elvis was big or Michael Jackson was big," but they didn't have social media. Someone couldn't hit Michael Jackson, be like "You suck" five seconds after a show. No matter how big Madonna was or anything, they didn't have this social media aspect of it to kind of interfere with their own belief in themselves. I deal with shit a lot. You know, a lot of insecurity, a lot of self-doubt and everything and like, "Oh, I'm not good enough" because oftentimes I do feel like that. And it's not because, like, "Oh, I'm famous or whatever, I don't have to deal with that shit." Sometimes it just gets tacked on a lot more. And that's one of the reasons I stopped with the social media and everything. It's just like, "Oh, I don't... I don't wanna hear that I look like a dog today." Now before I play this next song, I wanna take a moment to dedicate it to every person in this building who's ever had their fuckin' heart broken. This song is for you. And if you know the words, sing it as loud as you fuckin' can. ♪ Ooh, I fall apart ♪ ♪ Ooh, yeah, mm-hmm ♪ ♪ She told me that I'm not enough ♪ ♪ And she left me with a broken heart ♪ ♪ She fooled me twice and it's all my fault ♪ ♪ She cut too deep, now she left me scarred ♪ ♪ And now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain ♪ ♪ And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh, I fall apart ♪ ♪ Way down to my core ♪ ♪ Ooh, I fall apart ♪ ♪ Down to my core ♪ ♪ Ooh, I didn't know it before ♪ ♪ Surprised when you caught me off guard ♪ ♪ All this damn jewelry I bought ♪ ♪ You was my shorty, I thought ♪ ♪ Never caught a feelin' this hard ♪ ♪ Harder than the liquor I pour ♪ ♪ Tell me you don't love me no more ♪ ♪ But I can't let go ♪ ♪ Everybody told me so ♪ ♪ Feelin' like I sold my soul ♪ ♪ Devil in the form of a whore ♪ ♪ Devil in the form of a... ♪ ♪ No, you said it ♪ ♪ No, you said it, hey ♪ ♪ No, you said it ♪ ♪ That we'd be together, oh ♪ When you listen to his music, he's really saying what he feels. And that's how Post communicates. Music helps you put those therapeutic moments of "I need to talk to somebody" into a sonic form, into an artistic form, that actually becomes an experience. Everything under control? Everything is under control. Don't you think? It's a hot daddy winter. To Swae's mother and father. Mark, get off our bus, bro. And stop filming. Fucking broken down. Man, look at all this. Shit. ♪ Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin' ♪ We're about to turn this up to another level. You ready? Ra-ta-ta. You know how we do. London Lounge on the track. Listen, listen, bro. This is on the movie. Get to... Get the point, nigga. It's draining a little bit because when you're doing, like, close to 40 shows, seeing that many cities and stuff like that and be lit every single night and then you gotta get back up, drive to this next spot, do it all over again. On tour, when we have those runs, you get tired, you get beat up mentally. Post, if he's tired and he's stressed, he's gonna be real down. You already missed. Because stress also kills the body. Why y'all act like y'all never played this game before?! On tour, you're surrounded by people every single second of every day. And it's exhausting sometimes. Yo! Rest in peace, cups. Rest in peace, cups. RIP, Lil Peep. Forever. Rest in peace, Lil Peep. We love you more than you could ever fucking know and more than you could ever fucking understand. I swear to God, you changed the fucking world. Lil Peep forever. In Atlantic City, you were listening to Lil Peep. Can you tell me about that? Lil Peep, he was on tour too and just... He passed away in a really unfortunate way and, like, some nights when you just get drunk and you just put those songs on and you just... You just feel that emotion. He was a 20-year-old kid. We're all in that world and it just hit so close to home. I think Post felt that too. Peep was such a cool dude and such a, like, a trendsetter and a sweet guy and a troubled soul in himself. He impacted other people and helped a lot of people through their dark times. Peep's just an incredible dude and we miss him very, very much. Everybody has pain in life and if you say you don't, then you're just hiding. If you share your pain with other people, it's the most intimate and I feel like it's... There's nothing else more to share. I have no fucking idea what I would do without, you know, being able to make music, you know? It's, uh... It would be way different. This next song is off Beerbongs & Bentleys. It's called "Stay." If you know the words, then... I think it goes like this. ♪ It's true ♪ ♪ That all that you know ♪ ♪ Is all that you are ♪ ♪ You said that it's all that you want and more ♪ ♪ Fuck off and pour another drink ♪ ♪ And tell me what you think ♪ ♪ You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now ♪ ♪ You put your cigarette out on my face ♪ ♪ So beautiful, please, woman ♪ ♪ Don't break your back for me ♪ ♪ I'll put you out of your... ♪ ♪ Misery ♪ ♪ Tell me that it's all okay ♪ ♪ I've been waitin' on this all damn day ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Call me in the mornin' ♪ ♪ Tell me how last night went ♪ ♪ I'm here ♪ ♪ But don't count on me to ♪ ♪ Stay a little longer if you convince me ♪ ♪ And tell me all the things that you have against me ♪ ♪ Every time we make up, the truth is fadin' ♪ ♪ Everybody's blind when the view's amazin' ♪ ♪ Damn, who are we right now? ♪ ♪ Can we have a little conversation? ♪ ♪ Figure it out with no intoxication ♪ ♪ We carry on, what is our motivation? ♪ ♪ We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it? ♪ ♪ Maybe we're used to this ♪ ♪ Tell me, what are we to do? ♪ ♪ It's like we only play to lose ♪ ♪ Chasin' pain with an excuse ♪ ♪ I love that shit and so do you ♪ ♪ But don't break your back for me ♪ An entire arena of people night after night, he takes that song and makes it for them.

It's awesome. ♪ Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went ♪ ♪ I'm here ♪ ♪ But don't count on me ♪ ♪ To stay ♪ Thank you so fucking much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. I've always thought of it as, like, kind of me and then the audience and we're all together. At the same time as being a big arena, it still feels like it has a intimacy, like it's just... just a couple friends hanging out. Yeah. I've seen a lot of good shows here. That was fucking awesome. - Thank you very much. - Yeah. That's everything, y'know. The crowd is everything. And you fucking did it, dude. Thank you, sir. Post does a show singing in front of 22,000 people, kills it, walks off stage, and then go right back to playing beer pong without skipping a beat. Take us to the promised land. Everybody relaxes differently, but I go play beer pong with the boys and just shoot the shit, listen to music. You're gonna be an explosive player. Oh! Like, I like to have a nice balance of... I don't wanna be fucking miserable all the time, so sometimes I like to, you know, just go buck wild with the boys. Ooh. I actually lost 50 grand to him in a beer pong tournament. Get the fuck out of my face, dude. How do you think growing up in Texas shaped you? There was just people who believed in me the whole time, so that's awesome to me. And now you're going back and playing Posty Fest. Yeah, which is fucking awesome. Get that shit. You catching that? You see that shit? You see that shit? Posty Fest was the mountain in the road of the Runaway Tour. We did the first one in 2018 and that was a much smaller scale under different circumstances. But you fast-forward a year and we're the middle of a arena run at a venue that holds 80,000. The arenas are big, but the stadiums, they're four to five times that size. Well, we got to play in God's stadium, which is the coolest thing. Yeah, the top opens up so God can watch his team play. Post is the best! Post Malone, I love you! Never in a trillion fucking years would I have imagined that the city would come out and support new music and just, you know, spread love. It's bitchin'. Make some fucking noise! He's 25 years old and he has a festival at the AT&T Stadium in your hometown where you grew up, where his dad used to work. You tell me, is that... That's pretty legendary. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. It's genuine, it's me. I mean, I'm a goofy kid. I like to have fun. I like to fuck around. I never took myself too seriously and I feel like the fans relate to that. And I think that's what helps my music be so, uh, relatable, is it's just like, "Oh, he's just like me." I killed somebody with this hammer and I cut him up with this buzzsaw. And then I chopped a watermelon in half with this Claymore. And then, with these waves, I washed away all my sins. He was always kind of an eccentric kid, always creative, artistic. And fortunately, Austin has been able to be who he is, um, since he was two. My dad's bigger than me in Texas, you know, especially at the stadium. I'm just like 2.0. I'm just a little cooler than he is. You can't believe how proud anybody could be watching him. Everybody watching, the family's all here tonight. But as a dad, it's incredible. ♪ Said she tired of lil' money, need a big boy ♪ ♪ Pull up 20-inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy ♪ ♪ Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy ♪ ♪ Shawty mixin' up the vodka with the LaCroix, hey ♪ ♪ G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon, G-Wagon ♪ ♪ All the housewives pullin' up ♪ ♪ I got a lot of toys ♪ ♪ 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy ♪ ♪ You was talkin' shit in the beginnin' ♪ ♪ Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' ♪ ♪ I know I piss you off to see me winnin' ♪ ♪ See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin', hey ♪ ♪ Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me ♪ ♪ Hundred deep when I roll like the army ♪ ♪ Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely ♪ ♪ It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" ♪ ♪ Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me ♪ ♪ Yeah, your grandmama probably know me ♪ ♪ Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely ♪ ♪ It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" ♪ ♪ Everywhere I go, catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo ♪ ♪ 750 Lambo in the Utah snow ♪ ♪ Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah ♪ ♪ Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck ♪ ♪ Pull up to the house with some big butts ♪ ♪ Turn the kitchen counter to a strip club ♪ ♪ Me and Dre came for the... ♪ ♪ When I got guap, all of y'all disappeared ♪ ♪ Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared ♪ ♪ Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid ♪ ♪ This is not a 40, but I'm... ♪ ♪ Used to have a lot, but I got more now ♪ ♪ Made another hit 'cause I got bored now ♪ ♪ Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down ♪ ♪ Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy ♪ That's all we do, just make music, have fun, enjoy life.

Man. Get this fuck out of my face. What studio are we going to? - Huh? - What studio are we going to? I don't know where he's going. Music's what I love to do.

Okay, I need more. I need more of everything, Louis. ♪ When I'm looking at you, I got nervous ♪ ♪ Looking at you, I was with a virgin ♪ We made a song called "Virgin at Night." It's, like, some real, like, Beatles-type song or like... That's just one of the beautiful songs we made. Like, it's... You know what I'm saying?

Get the fuck out of there! You don't try to make a hit, you just go in there and you do what you do. You can't just be like, "I'm about to go make a hit song, where the studio at? Point me to the mic." You gotta go in there and just do what you do and catch a vibe and really listen to the music. You gotta know your voice. You gotta know what you're trying to say to the people. I feel good about this song. Like, this song stands out. You know I'm saying? Everybody loves it. We love it. We don't even really know what it is. We know it's just this happy vibe, joyful song. The Swae-and-Post combo was crazy. They're such good friends and stuff. It's just, like, the vibe is there, you know. Has everyone in here seen the second-newest Spiderman movie? Me and a good friend of mine, Swae Lee, made a very special song. You never know that a song's gonna go that big, but yeah, I mean, "Sunflower" felt amazing. It was like, "This is special," just the feeling of it. It just has a certain vibe and a certain feeling to it that is, like, rare to come by. Come on out. Hot daddy. God damn. ♪ Ayy, ayy, ayy ♪ Post and his people, they invited me and my camp. You know, we did, like, seven songs that night.

And even if they don't know who I am or Swae is, they're like, "Oh, yeah, I know that song," you know, no matter where you are. It's pretty wild shit. You know, it's... It's a crazy feeling.

Ahh. - What's up? - We're good. - How are you, man? - Ain't nothin', chillin'. - You all right? - Yeah, what's going on? Aah! Dangerous photo right here. Dangerous photo right here. ♪ Tryin' to have some dinner with some candlelight ♪ - This group, who is it? - Post Malone. - Who? - Post Malone. Say his name again. Post Malone. You sing? Yeah. You gotta be good, man, to have this big-ass bus. Why can't you have Travis Scott and Ozzy Osbourne on the same song? Why the fuck not? That was all Watt's fault. He was like, "Yeah, I'm doing shit with fuckin' Ozzy Osbourne. Do you guys wanna do a song?" And I'm like, "Are you fucking shitting me?" I met Kelly, Ozzy's daughter, at a party and Post was working on his album. We had talked about, you know, him collaborating with different people. So I asked her if Ozzy would ever do a song with Post and she said, "We all love Post, but let me ask him." And he was into it and Post was like, "Are you fucking kidding me? Of course." That's Post's hero. Are these monitors on? Is it possible to have a little guitar coming through them? No problem. That would be killer. Run the track. Let's go with track, Willie, please. Ozzy comes over to my house, we put on the track, and he just immediately just started writing lyrics and melodies and it was just like this gleam came out over his eye. And he killed it. I mean, you hear the recording, that does not sound like a 71-year-old man. It was the first time I was ever involved in music that was larger than the song being made. It gave someone, like, a new lease on life. We have the house or we can't? Yeah, yeah, we can have the house, sure. Yeah, but we're gonna start from the beginning. We'll bring you out to here and then the song starts. Right, Dennis? You'll start when I come here? Yeah, you'll start when you come here. Okay. Roller coaster. I'll end up in the fucking front row. Look at this, this is just like a landing strip. Hey, can you just hold for a minute? - Yeah. - It's like a model runway. Open the machine, I'll go... Then we should probably do it with the show queue for him. So are we done? Yeah, we wanted to have Post run it with you one time. Where's Post? Post and Ozzy, this is gonna be the first time they shake hands, hug each other. The fuckin' Prince of Darkness. He's coming down the ramp right now. - Post is? - Yeah. Okay. Um, Post is here. He's walking onto the stage. Okay. How are you? Hey. Good to see you. How are you? I'm all right. - You look great. - Thank you. - Are you excited? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You ready to party? Good afternoon, sir. How are you? - Hi. Thomas. - You all right? - Hey, asshole. - Hey, brother. Sorry, dude. It's fuckin' Ozzy Osbourne. - Are you kidding? - You're cute. Look at this. Look at it, man. It's the best. This is gonna be bad-ass, man. Really. I was nervous meeting him, not as much performing. But meeting him is terrifying 'cause, you know, what the fuck you say to Ozzy Osbourne, you know? "I like your pants." I don't know, you know. You have no idea what the fuck to say to him. It's mind-blowing. It's absolutely fuckin' mind-blowing that, you know, being able to work with, like, one of the biggest dudes in fuckin' rock and roll history. It's pretty bad-ass. Okay, Willie, let's go for track.

Andrew fuckin' Watt! And that's pretty fucking cool. I don't care who you are. I mean, when I saw Ozzy on stage, it was just... It felt almost surreal. It felt like, "Wow, this is gonna be a part of history." He's becoming an icon and he has icons that wanna be on stage with him. And it was such a special moment. Thank you. Thank you. You know Jared? - Oh, my God. - This is my mom, Sharon. It's only been, like, how many years? Oh, my God. It's gotta be 20. It's so good to see you. He's one of those people that manifests. And when he says something, he says he wants to do it, he goes and he does it. Staying pure and doing exactly what he wants has always been the way for him. Did you know my friend Austin? Just be yourself. The natural way is the... is the best way I feel, like, for me. There's no constraints on it. You can just kind of, like, do whatever you want. It's endless. Good to see you. There's been so many moments that we've all been there to be like, "Holy shit, this is real." You know, I think you can count maybe on one hand how many hip hop artists can sell out arenas. Didn't Eddie Vedder say you're nobody till you play MSG? Two nights in Madison Square Garden sold out, sold out arena tour, but it's not just any arena tour, it's Madison Square Garden. It's where you dream of. It's the things that you fuckin' dream of all your fuckin' life. Thank you so much. Yeah, right, and then this is to really commemorate your time here. Wow. It's a ticket. Yeah. This is so cool. It's just a mind-blowing thing to be able to go to, like, one of the most renowned music venues where literally everybody, like, all your heroes have played. And it's just pretty fuckin' neat. You know, I remember when you were playing in the theater. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a couple of years, it wasn't even that long ago. And now you've sold out literally every single ticket for these two shows. - That's bad-ass. - Yeah, it's bad-ass. - Amazing. - Yeah. - So congratulations. - Thank you very much. I think sometimes it takes a while for, like, critic-type people to, like, come around. Once he knew that he proved them wrong, it was just exciting, man. This Runaway Tour, it's different. It's, like, a full-blown experience. The things that you're gonna look back on and be like, "Wow, that was nuts. Like, that was historical." This is one of those pinch-yourself moments. You're truly, truly blessed and thankful and kind of in awe of what's happening. Post Malone, my man! - Whoo! - Whoo! Fuck what they say. You know, just be yourself and tell 'em to fuckin' shove it. Honestly... Words cannot express how fuckin' grateful, how fuckin' thankful I am that we can all come together tonight, sing these songs, and forget about all the hate and the violence and the bullshit on the outside world and just have a night filled with fuckin' love! ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Metro Boomin want some more, nigga ♪ ♪ My momma called, "I seen you on TV, son" ♪ ♪ Said shit done changed ever since we was on ♪ ♪ I dreamed it all ever since I was young ♪ ♪ They said I wouldn't be nothin', now they always say congratulations ♪ ♪ Worked so hard, forgot to vacation ♪ ♪ They ain't never had the dedication ♪ ♪ People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it ♪ ♪ Yeah, we made it, hey ♪ ♪ They was never friendly, yeah ♪ ♪ Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah ♪ ♪ And I know I sound dramatic, yeah ♪ ♪ But I know I had to have it, yeah ♪ ♪ For the money, I'm a savage, yeah ♪ ♪ I be itching like a addict, yeah ♪ ♪ I'm surrounded, 20 bad bitches, yeah ♪ ♪ But they didn't know me last year, yeah ♪ ♪ Everyone wanna act like they important ♪ ♪ But all that mean nothin' when I saw my dog ♪ ♪ Everyone counting on me, drop the ball, yeah ♪ ♪ Everything costin' like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ If you fuck with winnin', put your lighters to the sky ♪ ♪ How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind? ♪ ♪ Comin' with that bullshit, I just put it to the side ♪ ♪ Ballin' since a baby, they could see it in my eyes ♪ ♪ My momma called, "Seen you on TV, son" ♪ ♪ Said shit done changed ever since we was on ♪ ♪ I dreamed it all ever since I was young ♪ ♪ They said I wouldn't be nothin', now they always say congratulations ♪ ♪ Worked so hard, forgot to vacation ♪ ♪ They ain't never had the dedication ♪ ♪ People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it ♪ ♪ Yeah, we made it ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey ♪ I love you more than life itself!
