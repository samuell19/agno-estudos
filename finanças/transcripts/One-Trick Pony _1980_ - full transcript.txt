Got any spare change, man? Excuse me, brother, could I talk to you for a second? Brother, you got a second to spare there? Excuse me, brother, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi there. Can i-- do you have a minute? Excuse me, brother, can I talk to you for a second? No, thanks. Not interested. Well, do you mind if I walk with you? Are you from Cleveland or are you just visiting? I'm really not interested. How do you know you're not interested? You don't even know what I'm going to say. I know. This is not my first airport. Hey, you're into music, brother. That's great, beautiful. You ever hear of George Harrison and Stevie wonder? You know what? They're into the baghavaghita. They wrote songs about it and everything. Can--can I give you something? No. It's free. Here. No, thanks. No, thanks. Uh, I got a lot on my mind right now. Krishna has a lot to say about a troubled mind, man. You should check this out. No, thanks. You said that your mind is troubled. Why don't you check it out, brother? You know, this is such a minor point, I hate even to bring it up, but I have a brother. We're all brothers. No, I mean, I have a real brother. We're all real brothers. This real brother used to sleep in the other bed in my room. Look, look, all I'm saying to you is if you want to purify your existence, get into your spiritual self, check it out. Ok, ok. Hari krishna. Ok, ok, Harry chapin. [Music plays on radio] Man: Did you see the bird? Second man: Yes, I did. Takes a lot of chops to prove it. Radio dj: Back soon with the boss of bosses. Will you please buzz on down? I'm going to bribe it up with some rock n' roll concert tickets coming up after we take a break with the news. News flash: He calls them niggers, I call them trash. I'll let you know what's going on in the world out there. And keep it beautiful. If you're in the park system, keep your pants up and your eyes open. [Changing channels] [Man laughs] We--we--we--we were up for a while. Commercial announcer: And the track is slow going on Broadway, except by your favorite watering hole. We've got to keep up our reputation. So, come on down tonight to the agora for our weekend stretcher with the Jonah levin band. Hey, man, how come you came so late? Second man: I thought it was Friday. See, they done told me it was the 20th and 24th. Third dj: ...52nd street, and some motown memories... The tempting temptations... Hello. Uh, Jonah levin. A reservation for 5 rooms. Hey, junior, what time's the first set? Clarence, come right in. I mean, taking a bath's usually a private moment for me, but I don't mind sharing this time with you. What time's the first set? 9:00. But we leave at about 8:15. That's it, huh? I am, after all, a Caucasian. I understand and I sympathize. Clarence Franklin on piano. Danny duggin on drums.

Excuse me? It goes booch! Ha ha ha! Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, I got 2 Heineken, I got 2 Remy, a sloe gin fizz, and a Jack Daniels neat. Club policy is 1/3 off the menu. Who wants to sign? Warner Bros. Going to pay for it. Waitress: Oh, come on. You guys aren't with Warner Bros. I got to turn in a slip. So, you know, who's it going to be? Jonah: Just leave it here. We'll straighten it out later. [Music plays] Come on in. Richie? Who's Richie? [Arf arf] He's my dog. I picked him out of a garbage can when he was just a tiny puppy. Literally a garbage can. Incredible. I know. I was outside the kitchen in the alley, you know, behind the club just grabbing a smoke or something. And I heard this little, tiny whimper, and it was him. It was Richie. Richie. I used to have a dog. Oh, what happened, did he die? Oh, no. He's very much alive. He's my ex-dog. He lives with my ex-wife in my ex-apartment. Oh. Do you have any kids? I have a son. Your ex-son? Nah, he's not in the ex-group. He'll always be my son. Yeah. What's his name? Matty. You live alone? I have a boyfriend, if that's what you mean. But we don't live together. I mean, he loves me and all, but we don't live together. How long you been divorced? Well, I'm actually just separated. Separated. So, you'll probably try and get back together. Where is your boyfriend? On the road. He's a roadie. Travels a lot? A lot, yeah. What do you do when he's gone? So, when I got my job waitressing, I just quit my other job. I mean, it doesn't pay as much as my first job, but I get to hear all the rock n' roll I want. So, you know. You really love rock n' roll. Oh, Christ, yeah. Kept me sane when I was a kid. Why is that? Oh, because we were always moving around the country. My dad--well, my dad's firm, they would transfer him to a different city about every other year, so, you know, so... What does he do? He's an engineer. Like, I was always having to change houses, change schools, you know, change friends. I think that's when I really got into A.M. radio. 'Cause it didn't matter where I was in the United States, they were always playing the same songs. That was like the thread that ran through my life. A.M. radio and rock n' roll kept me sane. Oh, don't use that one. That one's perfumed. Come on, look here. Use this one. Anyway, wh--oh. I guess I must've been somewhere around 13, 14. Anyway, around there. You know, the real awkward time. And I decided that I was going to be a singer like Janis joplin, you know? Get up on stage and scream, drink a lot of southern comfort, meet cute guys. And so I told my mom-- I told my mom that I was going to be a singer. My mom, she says, "doral, I never knew you could sing." So, I hopped up right there in the living room in front of the TV, and I sang the first two verses from Bobby McGee for her. Blew her mind. ♪ Busted flat in Baton Rouge ♪ ♪ waitin' for a train ♪ ♪ feelin' near as faded as my jeans ♪ ♪ da da-da ♪ Those are the drums. ♪ Da da-da ♪ ♪ Bobby found the diesel down ♪ ♪ just before it rained ♪ ♪ he rode US all the way in-- ♪ Etcetera, etcetera.

What are you doing at up this hour? Yeah, I know it's early. Well, I had a bad dream, and I woke up, and I decided to call. What happened? Sounds like there is something really wrong. Nah, just a weird dream in a motel room. Hold on, I can't hear. Matty's got a television show on. Where are you? I'm in Cleveland. Just wanted to hear your voice. What? I can't hear. I say, I'm in Cleveland. And I just wanted to hear your voice, and know that Matty's fine. Yeah, he's fine. Christ, long distance calls at 6:30 in the morning. I thought the police were going to tell me you're dead or something. Nah, not dead. I'm in Cleveland. [Music plays] Um, Matty would really like to see you. He's a little upset about things. Jonah: Well, he could stay with me for a couple of days when I get back after our date. Mmm. Jonah, I made an appointment for a meeting with the lawyers. We both have to be there to sign. Why do we both have to be there? Well, that's what I said. Yeah, well, uh, I don't know about you, but I don't particularly look forward to having your lawyer and you and my lawyer... Marion: I know. I don't look forward to it either. Well, that's why we should call them and say-- I don't think we should talk about it right now, ok? Ok. Ok. Well, good-bye. Ok, good-bye. [Click] Your daddy said to give you a big kiss. You're going to go spend a couple of days at his new apartment when he gets back. Danny: Ok, here we go. "2 bands perform at the agora." We got reviewed. "The agora presented an evening "of diverse musical styles last night "when it paired a new wave band, the b-52s, "with the veteran Jonah levin band. "The b-52s are the latest darlings "of the new wave of rock that is sometimes called punk." Uh, skip that shit. Let's hear about US. ♪ Lord, I am a working man ♪ ♪ and music is my trade ♪ ♪ I'm travelin' with this 5-piece band ♪ ♪ I play the ace of spades ♪ ♪ I have a wife and family ♪ ♪ they don't see much of me ♪ ♪ god bless the absentee... ♪ "This highly regarded band "of the late sixties and seventies "hasn't appeared in Cleveland for some time. "Perhaps this accounted for the muted reception "that greeted their performance muted reception?In the early show last night." They call that a muted reception? ♪ ...and music is my knife ♪ ♪ it cuts away my sorrow ♪ ♪ and purifies my life ♪ ♪ but if I could release my heart ♪ ♪ from veins and arteries ♪ ♪ I'd say, god bless the absentee ♪ ♪ I miss my woman so ♪ ♪ I miss my bed ♪ ♪ I miss those soft places ♪ ♪ I used to lay my head... ♪ "The drummer, whose name I didn't get..." Oh, great. "Was as solid as a metronome. "The bassist and piano player "were equally competent if uninspiring." Uninspiring? "However, "lead guitarist, Lee-Andrew Parker, "was a real gem "playing some of the most mellifluous solos this reviewer has heard in a long time." Hey. What's mellifluous? I think it means about the same as bodacious. ♪ My son don't need me yet ♪ ♪ his bones are soft ♪ ♪ he flies a silver airplane ♪ ♪ he wears a golden cross ♪ ♪ god bless the absentee ♪ ♪ lord, this country's changed so fast ♪ ♪ the future is the present ♪ ♪ the present's in the past ♪ ♪ the highways are in litigation ♪ ♪ the airports disagree ♪ ♪ god bless... ♪ "The band's 50-minute set "consisted of some familiar levin compositions, "though he left out soft parachutes, "his anti-war hit of the late sixties. "Levin himself seems somewhat less ambitious these days "or maybe we just caught him on an off-night. "The fire of his earlier works "seems to have dimmed somewhat, "although sparks were still visible at times last night in the agora." That's it. Clarence: Ah, who gives a shit. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em, right. Yeah, fuck him. Who gives a shit? Yeah, who gives a shit? Would you read that part about me again? He's mellifluous. What are you doing here? I used to live in this apartment house, and thought I'd come by and see my old room. Hmm. I thought you were supposed to be in Dayton. I came home early. How come, weren't you working? Yeah. But they canceled everything but our weekend show. Um, I just can't imagine them folding. Christ, that club was around for a long time. Well, it's gone now. Yeah, I remember this place. The fern is doing very well. Yes, the fern isdoing well. It's doing very, very well. You spray it regularly, do you? I spray it every day, and I talk to it, give it lots of encouragement. [Whispering] You haven't told her about our separation. No, absolutely not. I didn't think it would be wise at this time. It's just beginning to sprout new leaves. Where's Matty? It's only 2:00. He's got his play group on wednesdays. Oh, yeah. I'll bet he'll be surprised to see me. My mother came down for a few days last week. Oh, that's nice. How's old Florence doing? Well, she's fine, I guess. You know, it's the same old story with her. The broad hints about reconciliation, that sort of thing. After 2 days, I am ready to scream. I'd like to talk to you about Matty. No yogurt. No strawberry yogurt. Well, you were the one who liked strawberry yogurt. Boy, you get a little separated, and you can just forget a few strawberry yogurt. Talk to Matty about what? Well, he's got this idea that he wants to be a songwriter and play in a band. Role model identification. I wish you could supply him with some other role to model himself after. I don't see anything wrong with the model he's got now. Well, it hasn't turned out to be so great for you. I don't know. Hasn't been bad. It's been 15 years. 14. It's the longest adolescence I have ever seen. [Sighs] Well, admit it. In 6 years you'll be 40 years old. Now, you've gone directly from adolescence to middle-age. In 6 years I'll be 40 years old. In 16 years I'll be 50 years old. In 26 years I'll be 60 years old. In a mere 66 years, I'll be 100 years old. A grown man living in a kid's world. "Grown man living in a kid's world." You don't always have to be sarcastic. Well, I'm not always sarcastic. Well, I was sarcastic in the late seventies-- maybe '77-'78-- but, really, since February '79, I have hardly been sarcastic. You see, that is sarcastic. Well, what do you expect? Grown men living in a kid's world. What do you think I'm doing out there, cashing in my "e" tickets for a ride through the magic kingdom? You think I'm playing my gigs in the haunted house? No. What I mean is, you have wanted to be Elvis Presley since you're 13 years old. Now, that is not a goal you're likely to achieve. He didn't do so well with it himself. Don't you think that it's time you gave up the illusion? Wait a minute. I know that voice. That's the voice of the infamous Dr. Engelhart about to deliver her "be a grownup" speech. Isn't that so, Dr. Engelhart? I really think you ought to examine your hostility to Dr. Engelhart. I have no hostility to Dr. Engelhart. I'm just tired of hearing engelhart's toy phrases come out of your mouth. They're not toy phrases. She observed--i'm merely passing on the observation-- that kids play rock 'n' roll, kids listen to it. Really? Well, is she aware that Anna Freud-- Anna Freud-- happens to love rock 'n' roll? She came backstage and sold US some blow in akron, Ohio. That's where she lives. Do you want a cup of coffee? Yeah. Any stimulants will do. Look, everybody's getting older. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just... I don't know, when you get to a certain age, rock 'n' roll is... It's kind of pathetic. You know... I gotta go. It's been great, as usual. What are you so afraid of anyway, young girls won't like you when you're on the road? I'll tell you what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of you boring me to tears. Yeah. You know, Marion, you used to, you know-- you're so fucking boring! [Crying] I'm sorry. I don't know what you want. You want me to drive a cab? You want me to give guitar lessons to 13-year-old kids? I'm a player. That's what I do. No. I just want... I just wanted... I wish that when you were here, you were really here. I mean, really with US. Not just sleeping here or talking on the phone here or trying to write songs here, but...here. A family. The road is the road. This was supposed to be home. It's a great day for baseball here at yankee stadium. The New York Yankees take on the Boston Red Sox. On the mound for the Red Sox, their ace, the fantastic starter-- Dennis eckersley. I'm frank nesser, and I'm Phil rizzuto. We'll be broadcasting the game today. We should be ready to begin right now. Eckersley has finished his warmups. The first batter for the Yankees will be... Reggie Jackson. Reggie Jackson, just entering second grade at the little red schoolhouse down in greenwich village. Ok. Reggie digs in. Look at the concentration on him. Incredible. Here comes the pitch... Swung on and missed. Strike one. And eckersley is looking very sharp today. He's throwing smoke up there, throwing smoke. Reg knocking some dirt off his spikes. Eckersley looks in, he takes a sign. Around comes the left arm, here comes the pitch. And it's... Swung on and missed. Good swing. Good swing. It was a very good swing. It was a miss, but it was a good swing. Looked like he's going for the bleachers, didn't it, Phil? It certainly did, frank. He's almost up to fractions now, the reg. Yeah. That second-grade class is moving at a fantastic pace. It's just amazing that a guy can learn fractions, completely finish his reading assignment, and still be in there on the last day of the pennant race. Well, that's just the kind of kid he is. Eckersley looks in for the sign. And the pitch... Reg swings-- it's swung on. That could be outta here. It's big trouble. Reggie's going around first and second. It could be a home run. This could be the play at the plate. And here he comes down the third base-- holy cow! I don't believe it. I don't believe it. And eckersley is arguing the call. He's saying he missed the plate. Did you hit that plate? Yes. Well, it's a home run for reg. ♪ Who knows my secret broken bone? ♪ ♪ Who feels my flesh when I am gone? ♪ ♪ Who was a witness to the dream? ♪ ♪ Who kissed my eyes and saw the scream ♪ ♪ lyin' there? ♪ ♪ Nobody ♪ ♪ who is my reason to begin? ♪ ♪ Who plows the earth, who breaks the skin? ♪ ♪ Who took my 2 hands and made them 4? ♪ ♪ Who is my heart, who is my door? ♪ ♪ Oh, nobody ♪ ♪ nobody but you, girl ♪ ♪ mm-mm ♪ ♪ nobody but you ♪ ♪ nobody in this whole wide world ♪ ♪ nobody ♪ ♪ who makes the bed that can't be made? ♪ ♪ Who is my mirror, who's my blade? ♪ ♪ When I am rising like a flood ♪ ♪ who feels the pounding in my blood? ♪ ♪ Oh, nobody ♪ ♪ nobody ♪ ♪ nobody but you ♪ ♪ nobody but you, girl ♪ ♪ nobody in this whole wide world ♪ ♪ nobody, girl ♪ ♪ no, nobody... ♪ "...lawful for the wife and the husband "to live separately and apart from each other "for the rest of their lives "and free from interference, authority, "or control by the other as fully as if he or she were single and unmarried." ♪ No-no-no-nobody but you, yeah ♪ ♪ yeah, nobody but you ♪ ♪ nobody in this whole wide world ♪ ♪ nobody ♪ ♪ nobody ♪ ♪ mm-mm, nobody ♪ ♪ nobody ♪ [Answering machine beeps] Man: Hello, Ziggy.

[Beep] Dad, mommy wants to know if this is the weekend I'm staying at your house. Call back. Bye. [Beep] Jonah. Bernie wepner. Listen, Walter fox is willing to meet you at his apartment and give a good listen to some of your new material. Uh, call Debbie for the address. I don't have it right in front of me. Bernie promises, Bernie delivers. Jonah, I don't mean to rush you, but, uh... Why don't you play what you consider your strongest material first. Uh, ahem, well-- I think it's very important for you to make the right record at this time. Not from, uh, just a career standpoint, but from--really from a whole industry point of view. Because you're known as someone who's been around for a while, and people feel-- perhaps erroneously-- that they know you, and they don't pay as much attention as they might to something that's new, that's--that's flashy. Not necessarily flashy, but, uh... New and... Cal? I want to hear what you think. You know, through the ears of A.M. radio. Well, you can have my opinion for whatever it's worth. For what it's worth, Cal, you have uncanny A.M. ears. 20 years of A.M. ears. That's what they're calling this profile piece that billboard is doing on me. 20 years of A.M. ears. Did I tell you they were doing a profile on me? No. Congratulations, Cal. Ahem. Uh... This song is called ace in the hole. It's been going over really well in the clubs that we've been playing. The only thing about it is that, uh... We alternate verses. I sing the first verse, and then Clarence Franklin, who's our keyboard guy in the band, he sings the second verse. So when you hear the second verse, you have to sort of imagine it's another voice.

Of course, a lot of people will tell you that it ain't music in those big halls. It's spectacle. But here's my point. Are you listening? And this is what I said in my profile. Music, spectacle-- what's the diff if it sells records? That's true. That's what I said to the guy at billboard. I said, "now, listen, "I'm a funny kind of guy, "but I will go out on a limb and I will tell you "that the stones-- "the stones are the only group "that ever successfully combined music and spectacle." Hmm? Maybe Springsteen. How about Albert schweitzer? Who's Albert schweitzer? You know, Africa, disease. He played the organ. Albert schweitzer--the king of music and spectacle. What label is he on?

And, uh-- what's this club like? Well, it was a folk club on the circuit where everybody worked-- pussy time. Tom Paxton, Dave Van ronk... New lost city ramblers, Bobby Gibson... Lee: Play something... Phil ochs. And then when everybody went electric, it became a blues club-- j. Geils band, Paul butterfield blues band, Sonny Terry and brownie mcghee.

Let me tell you something: We been friends a long time, but I can't live on no $400 a week. It doesn't cover my alimony or my dope bills. What dope bill? You haven't bought anything in years. Fuck you, years! You're not the only one with alimony and dope bills. But I am the only one with enough brains to notice when it's not working.

No. No, I'm not. Ah, yeah, yes, you are. You were always good at that stuff anyway. So were you. Yeah, so was I. You were good, and I was good. Everything was always good. Yes, that's the way it was. Then how come it ended up in such a mess? I don't know. Listen... Let's get in a couple more laughs here before we slip into our postcoital depression. Here's a joke for you: There was a rabbi, a minister-- Jonah, look, I told you this wouldn't be good for me. No, you didn't. You didn't say that. Well, you know, I knew I was gonna have to pay for it later. Yeah, but why does later have to come so soon? You mean, why doesn't it come after you've gone so you won't have to deal with it? Hey, I was just-- I was just trying to kid around. Oh, look... Look, Jonah, you can't just come here and fuck me anytime you want and then go on your merry way. I'm not on my merry way. No, I'm sorry, but I don't care about the band anymore. I care--oh, Christ. No, I don't care about the band breaking up, I care about our marriage breaking up! You left Matty and me! I don't know, Jonah. I just-- I just don't know. If you love something, somebody, you have to give, you have to be there. Anyway that's how it is for me. Jonah-- hey, Matty. Hey, Matthew. You ok? Yeah. Everybody's yelling, so I woke up. I know, sweetheart. Come to bed, I'll tuck you in. I want daddy to tuck me in! Ok. We'll--we'll both tuck you in. Jonah: Ok, back to bed you go. Is it too late for a story? Oh, yeah. You know what time it is? It's after midnight. That's not so late. Once I stayed up till 2:00. You did? Well, tonight's just not a good night for a story. So you have sweet dreams, and... I'll see you in the morning when the sun comes up. You aren't here in the morning when the sun comes up. Would you just go back to sleep, ok?

Well, you're the bright boy. I figured you'd know. [Chuckles] Steatopygous. What? Steatopygous. It means a large rump... A fat ass. Why is that the good word? Well, it's like, see-- what if I was-- if I was to say to you, "Cal, you have a very fat ass"... You could be offended. But if I say, "hey, good evening, Cal, you sure look steatopygous," then you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, do you? Hope you don't have any plans for getting your records played on any radio stations. Not really, no. Well, you shouldn't, 'cause you won't get any. Nice talking to you, schweitzer. Real little prick, don't you think? Gee, I couldn't tell. Couldn't tell?! Some more red wine, please. Yes, sir. Ah! Jonah, Jonah. Sit down. Jonah's leaving. I'm gonna put a fist right in his mouth. He's leaving.Either he leaves, or I do. Excuse me, John. Look, Cal says that Jonah called him a fat ass. I'd like Jonah to leave right now. I'll call him tomorrow. Thank you. Hey, John. Hello. Come over here. Hello. Hello. Do you remember me? I sure do. You're... Walter. Walter. Walter, uh, has asked me to discreetly get you out of here before you do any more harm to him or yourself. He mumbled something about... Cal Van damp's ass. Did you say something about that? You know, I did. [Clearing throat] I mentioned that it was fat. It isfat. Yes, well, uh, putting veracity aside for the moment... Walter feels that your presence here could be disruptive, so he has asked me to entice you to leave. To entice me to leave? Well, actually, he just said, "get him out." I added the word enticement. I thought it was a more appealing exit line. You know who's here tonight? Dick and deedee. You know what the whole buzz is around over here? They're getting back together. I think so. I think it's gonna happen again. What enticements could he have in mind? Oh, he had none. He had none. What enticements do you have in mind? Thank you. Why do you have this room here when you have the big suite upstairs? I don't. I just thought we might make some music while the occupants are out. Oh, where are they, at the party? I don't really know. You mean they could come in here at any moment? It's unlikely, but it's possible. You're crazy.

He's got a good sense of what's danceable, too. He's very top 40 oriented. That's the kind of album you should cut, don't you agree? Yeah. Steve, Jonah levin. Hi. We met in Chicago. I remember. I want you two to collaborate. Keep your eyes out for singles possibilities, something that has integrity, but still commercial. Great. When do we start? Anytime next week. Good for you, Jonah? Yeah, fine. That will give me a chance to rehearse with my band. Oh, your band. I have an idea about that. Well, now's the time to discuss it. I've been working with a rhythm section that I really like. I'd like to use them. Jonah, is that a problem for you if you use Steve's rhythm section? Yeah, it is a problem. See, I always work with my band. You worked without them in Chicago. That was a big mistake. I shouldn't have done that. And, uh, I just can't do it again. See, I've been with them for 10 years now. Can we do an experimental session? Not without the band. I, you know, I don't-- you know, i-- not without the band. Boys, let's don't make a melodrama out of this. Steve, why don't you work with Jonah's band? Uh, I'll be with them in a moment. I'm going to have to kick you guys out of here. I have some people waiting. It seems we have a plan of action. Steve? Absolutely. All right, my friend? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, uh, it's good to see you again. Nice to see you. Are you happy? I really appreciate this. Listen, i--i never figured that you'd ever want to see me again or talk to me or-- Jonah... Jonah... You wouldn't by any chance be fucking my wife? Because that wouldn't be conducive to a good artist/record company relationship. What was I going to say? "Yes, Walter, I am sort of fucking your wife." Is that what we're doing, sort of fucking? Well, what are we doing? Why did I come here? Why'd you call me? You're here because you came. And I called you because... Because you needed a job and I was sympathetic. Oh, is this my job? I don't hire my lovers. I can still actually score my points on the honor system. No, I'm not the one who's desperate. Look, I don't want to make my record because you told Walter to give me a break. You've got that all wrong. You ought to learn to take a friend's help when it's offered. Did you tell Walter to let me record? No. It was entirely his idea? No. I'll be 45 years old on my next birthday. The exact date I have succeeded in erasing from my memory. I don't particularly like the record business. I don't enjoy going to the conventions. I don't like going backstage. I don't smoke dope. I gave it up when they were still calling it reefers. I lost interest 10 years ago. You, on the other hand, you want this record. You need it. I'd like to see you get it.

The electric piano that Clarence is playing on the bridge, there's a beautiful thing there. I think we could have some strings in there. You know, nice, nice, nice heavy kind of string section. Texturally, it'd be beautiful. I think it's worth the time and the money to go in and book a session. Ha. What do you think, Clarence, strings on, uh... Ah, come on. It'd tear your heart out. You see, it's not that we don't want to have our heart torn out, it's just that we're trying to make a ballsy record here, you know, and we don't want it to be, uh...Lush. I want to make a ballsy record, too. Riv-river deep, mountain high, now that's a ballsy record, wouldn't you say, with strings in it? So we open it up texturally, then maybe we could add saxophone on the end, on the solo, on "roll on, roll on" part? Oh, no, you can't take out Lee-Andrew's solo. Listen, for crying out loud, he's all over the record. No, Lee-Andrew is the lead guitarist in this band and-- sure, he is. Sure, he is. This doesn't take away from Lee-Andrew. I'm sure he'd love it, too. Just broaden things a little bit. You know, don't you want to try for some airplay on this? You tell Lee-Andrew that you want to replace his solo with a sax. Now, listen, you know, what do you think I am, just a knob-Turner here? I made--i made a couple of records myself, you know. I know what I'm doing. I'm not here just to play with you.

Yeah, I like a lot of it, but see, now, he said that anything that we didn't like we didn't have to keep. And I think-- this is the most commercial thing you've cut in a long time. It's great.
