Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, lived a prince and a princess. The prince was without a kingdom, without a castle and without any subjects. That's why, in his shoes, you would also feel sad. As for the princess, she was not the prince's princess... She was a princess by birthright. They lived in two far away places, so far apart, it seemed impossible, they could ever meet. Yet, without knowing, they were already looking for each other, to become part of the same story. As in every respectable fairy tale, at some point, someone decided that it was time for them to meet... A fairy, you would say? A wizard? A malevolent witch? No. Much more! A psychotherapist. - Name? - Roberto Marino. - Can you please repeat it? - Beatrice Benassi. - Tell me something about yourself. - I'm a kleptomaniac. - I'm a narcoleptic. - Why have you chosen to change therapist? Doctor Allegri kicked me out. I stole her notes. If you agree we can meet on Thursdays. From 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. I have my Spanish course, I snack from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. So from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. would be perfect! From 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.? Yes great, I've got nothing to do, anyway! - Any questions? - Can I take a photo of you? Is there any chance you can give me a discount? - Let's go through downtown. - If we take the ring road it'll be quicker. Yes, but the ring road makes me sad. And don't worry about the meter, OK? - Are you crazy? - I'm sorry, sorry, so sorry. - I almost killed him. - Yes, I saw that! - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Valerio, pass it here! Excuse me, sir, can you give us back the ball, please? - Down to the ground! - Who is it? - Hands behind your head. - Face to the floor! - I am on the floor! Where do you think I am? I'm already on the floor. - What is going on? - Sorry love, we were playing "Bad Boys". You scared me to death. Idiots. - I'm sorry. - Now, you clean everything up, OK? Yes. - Sooner or later you going to end up shooting at someone. - It's empty. What are you doing with a gun? You work at the passport office. - Momentarily. - Momentarily, for the past four years. - We're going to the cinema, tonight. - Good for you, go. - And, you are coming as well. - No, I don't think so. You can't leave me alone. Dear? Robby is coming to the cinema with us, OK? - Great news! - You see? - Francesco, this has to end. - I'll pay for your ticket. - I don't care. Why don't you stay at home? - No, at home we have to talk! - So don't talk. If I don't talk, I have to breed. - Did you write these? - Yes. You should feel ashamed of them! Aside from the fact that these fairytales are written in a very disputable Italian, do we want to talk about the plot? - Are you listening to me at all? - Yes, yes. Do you really think that a 6 year old kid feels passionate about Daddy's dialysis? Gets excited about the adventures of Peppino, the pawn broker? Laughs wholeheartedly at the arrival - of an illegal immigrant plastic boat in Lampedusa? - No... But the stories with the fairies, the princes and the gnomes... they're beautiful, sure, but then the world is what it is... So, I've said to myself: "why not tell kids stories directly taken from the reality that awaits them?" It's none of my business, nevertheless I want to give you my most honest advice. - Seek psychological therapy. - Yes, of course. Trust me, it can only do good to you. I was admiring the effects of the combination of a grey jacket and a white hair dye. Perfect. The only way forward when you start to go salt and pepper. It's not a dye. Great... Where is your husband taking you tonight for Saint Valentine? - I'm a widow. - OK, from long... Three months. My parents are also dead. Since I'm eight years old. A terrible crash. Near Orte. It made history. It was in the newspaper, in all its incredible details. My father was at the wheel and my mother was next to him. But when they found them, my mother was at the wheel. Maybe it's now time to talk about the other problem... The child opened wide his eyes in amazement and said... What is your name? My name is Aghir and I window wipe cars at the stoplights. - What about you? - My name is Elia. Elia. No, that's not right, though! - Do you like the name Elia? - Sorry, but who are you? Do you like the name Elia? I've never liked male names that end in the letter A. I was just asking because I was recording it... What do you want from me? I don't even know you! - Do you live here? - Yes. - And you, do you live here? - Sometimes. - Sometimes? - I just come and go. Are you an airplane pilot? No... Usually they're incredibly cool and dress impeccably. You, look more like an electrician. Let's just say that I've flown a lot... before the crisis and the cuts... Anyway... Would you like a coffee? With an airplane pilot? Are you crazy? It's stopped raining. Goodbye. What's your name? You can tell me that, at least! Sara, Sara Berruti. I'm Roberto... Rob... Roberto Marino. I don't want to seem indiscrete, but what are you doing with the mixer? I mix. Are you currently in a steady relationship? What do you mean by steady relationship? A relationship with another woman that is full and satisfying, that is not limited by a mere physical one night stand. No, then no. The answer is no. Tonight is Saint Valentine. Don't you feel sad about spending it on your own? No, I will not spend it alone. Sadly, I won't. You wanted to let me down on Saint Valentine day? I don't know what tell her most of the time, imagine tonight! - What is it you have to tell her? - Today is lovers' day. It's dangerous. Look around you, so many couples looking at each other in the eyes. - Yes, I see it. - Today is a day of planning! All these cute tunes, cute hearts, cute little candles... - I've really had enough... - She's coming! Let's converse, find something to talk about. So Robby, what do you say? You insisted so much on joining us, we brought you along, so tell us something, now, come on! Yes, OK... I've met someone. - Great! - A waste of time. Not for you. - What do you know? - What do you know? Instincts. My instincts are never wrong. I've developed them a lot, in my work. - Stamping passports? - Do you think it's easy? You have a fraction of a second to know who you have in front. Sometimes I stamp it, sometimes I don't. It depends... - So how is she? - She's a bit weird. - See? She's weird. - What do you mean? She seems hard, but maybe she is just a very fragile person. - Like many of us women. - Anyway, she doesn't even look at me! - Better. - Why don't you surprise her with a gift? I don't know... Something small. Women love surprises. - Who is it? - It's Robby, I was looking for Sara. She's dead. - What do you mean... she's dead? - You haven't heard? - No. - She's gone. - Were you her friend? - Yes. No. We had met recently. I'm sorry, I feel terrible. How did she die? It was raining, she lost the wheel and crashed. It was Christmas Day. Christmas Day? But I saw her last week. Me too! I see her all the time, but she is gone. - I saw her down at the gate. - I saw her on the washing machine, but she is gone. So, I'll be going I guess. Goodbye now. - Is that a gift for Sara? - Yes, just a thought... I'll take it, it will keep me company. - But she is gone. - She is gone. Sara? Sara! - Who? - Sara. There has been a misunderstanding. I passed by to bring you a gift, but there is another Sara Berruti here. An old woman opened the door. What do you want from me? I brought you a small gift... to get to know each other a little better. - What gift? - The old woman has it now... A goldfish. No! Animals in cages, have always given me the creeps. I'm going to go now, anyway. Goodbye. - Hi... - I already told you last time. - No more gifts. - I just took the libert... - Hello! - Oh my god! Not you, again? I got you this little thing... a little retro for you... You don't need to buy me any presents! - But, no... - Salmon color especially, come on! Surprise! - You almost gave me a heart attack! Are you crazy? - It's a cactus! Stop it! I have already told you a thousand times. Stop it! I don't want these presents! - It's a cactus... - Stop it! Stop it now. - It's a desert plant. - No more! Thank you. Happy? - You're welcome. - Goodbye. The gift is inside. I'd like to get to know her better, take a trip with her, maybe just a stroll down the beach... Even find out how she was as a child! Tell her these things, a woman loves to hear these things! I feel like I have something in common with this girl. You recognize love from the smell, right? She smells like the woman of my dreams. - Oh my god! That's so romantic! - And what does it smell like? It's not perfume. The smell is a metaphor. Leave him alone! Keep on this road, it's the right path. The way of the romantic, tender kind of man is out of fashion. - Who told you so? - I'm telling you. Women of today like a man who treat them bad. Treat her bad! Leave him alone. I think she is now somewhere thinking about you. You think so? Roberto Marino is a depraved individual who continues to court me with absurd gifts. His haircut is terrifying, and dresses like a bum. Instinctively, I don't like him. A person who is without a doubt to avoid at all costs. Do you think, there was the need for all those details? - What details? - What details! The smell, the perfume of love, the walks on the beach. Who do you think you are, some Neapolitan poet? - No, but I think about these things. - Keep them to yourself! You instigate her to ask me: "Why not us?" - Yes, and why not you? - Because a decade has gone by. I want to see you, in my place, in ten years time! Now she has decided it's time to have a baby. Can you believe it? - I don't know how to stop her anymore. - Why don't you leave her? Matteo. Less mistakes, Matteo, please be more careful next time. Michelle. - Francesca. - Yes, teacher? I was reading your essay... Why did you write about something so sad? Because the thing that scares me the most in the world, - is the death of my parents. - You should not worry about it. Your mum and dad love you very much and will never leave you, ever. How do you know, that? It happened again. It happens mostly when I get excited. Has it ever happened to you with your partner? I don't understand your question. You said, "it happens to me when I get excited." Right? Do you get excited with your partner? What does that have to do with it! We've been together for 16 years! Do you love him? Of course, I could never be with a man I didn't love. You seem nervous when I ask you about the relationship with your partner. Amedeo is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me. Robby? Yes, but don't shout, OK? - Carlo asked if you could substitute him in the kids section. - I'm going. Once upon a time there was a little kid. His name was Marcolino. Marcolino had a Granny, whom he was very fond of... - Do you all have a Granny who you are very fond of? - Yes! But, Marcolino's granny was getting older, and his parents decided to take her to an old people's home. Marcolino was sad and kept asking: "What happened to Granny?" So, his parents decided to buy him a nice video game. He had wanted one for a long time and so it happened to be a great idea. The day after, Marcolino was less sad. Weeks passed, then months passed, and one day Marcolino's parents called him aside and said to him: "We have to give you some sad news: Granny has died." And Marcolino answered: "Granny? Granny who?" Now, did you like it? OK, thank you. Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. That was Doctor Grimaldi. - She asked me if I was ready to start group therapy. - Good. But, I also have my swimming course and was thinking that... Saturday is the only day we can spend together. But there is Sunday also, my dear, isn't there? It's not easy for me to be here and speak in front of all of you. I started thinking about suicide just before starting secondary school. I'm sorry about being late. I've had a problem with my scooter. Roberto, please sit next to Beatrice. - Please continue, Giovanni. - Shall I? - Yes. I always liked to be able to say something... So your real name is Beatrice! ...but then I thought that what I was saying was not that interesting... - Not Sara, but Beatrice. - Don't touch me. I don't understand. - I don't understand. - Don't touch me. - Beatrice, what is happening? - This man is bothering me. I've just asked for her name. He's been courting me for weeks buying me the weirdest gifts ever. Roberto, please introduce yourself to the group. Please. My name is Roberto Marino, I'm 36 years old, I'm single and I'm a kleptomaniac. So the pearl necklace in the box... They weren't real. I stole them, 16 euro and 90 cents. You gave me a stolen and fake pearl necklace? - But she took them! - Look at me! - One risks imprisonment... - Did I ask you to? - Excuse me, I was trying to say something. - You, shut up. No, you shut up. Group therapy is something to be taken seriously. You need to respect your companions. I require harmony, and your needs permitting, please clear the situation, before a next time. Today, both of you are dismissed. I'm sorry. Sorry. - Goodbye. - Hi. - Are you waiting for someone? - No. - You? - No. - Excuse me, sirs? - Yes. - Are you going to be long? - Just the time that it takes! He's saying... The necessary time required to finish the job. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'll leave, then. - Excuse me? If I bother you, I'll leave the group therapy. He's a hero, our airplane pilot. I'm not a pilot. Nor a hero. It's just that I'm used to it. - Used to leaving? - Used to being kicked out. I've been kicked out from everywhere and everything. From school, from the scouts, from the football team... One kick more, one less, what difference does it make! Excuse me, gentlemen? Where are you going? - We're going for a bite to eat. - He's saying... I've understood. But, when are you going to finish here? When we come back. Just wait a moment, OK? Wait. Please. - How come are you seeing Dr. Grimaldi? - I'm a narcoleptic. - Great. - You can't imagine how much! - What job do you do? - I'm a school teacher. Has it ever happened to you in class... Yes, but I've found a solution. I made a deal with a little girl and gave her a whistle. If I fall asleep, she whistles in my ear and I wake up again. Cool! Why you are always walking around with that big red book? This big red book is my life. Everything I do, see and most of what I think, goes in here. - What happens if you change your mind? - It rarely happens. But when it does, I take a post-it, I write on it my revaluation and stick it on. - Can I see it? - The big red book cannot be seen by anyone else but me. - Really? - Yes. Not even my boy-friend can see it. Are you seeing someone? Yes, Amedeo, we'll get married, next year. What does Amedeo do? His family owns a factory that makes watches and pendulums. - Amazing. - Are you seeing someone? You know what... It's not easy to fall in love... with someone who steals in your own home. So, only short-lived but intense experiences for me. Sometimes they've been real dramas. Like when I fell in love with someone I met at therapy. She had my same problem. - How did it end? - We both got arrested! But surely sometimes you've must have felt it was time to stop and spend time with someone? It's happened to me, yes. But it takes two... What did I say? Beatrice. - You've been very kind. - It was just a few drops of rain. - I missed my swimming lessons. - Yes, but I'm soaking wet instead! I apologize for asking... but, do you like lemon and coffee? I love it. It's my favorite. You should really try it. Maybe next time, thank you. So, it's time to go home early. Will we see each other, next Saturday? Yes. Bye. - Can I take a picture of you? - Yes, of course. Sorry, sorry... My hands are free, right? Don't move. Smile. Voilà, thank you. REVALUATION LEMON AND COFFEE MY FAVORITE FLAVORS Excuse me, are you going towards the ring road? Yes. It's less trafficked at this time. Amedeo? Bea! Good, OK. Let's start. - Shall we wait for Beatrice, Doctor? - Beatrice is not coming today. Sandra, how was your week, then? I can proudly say that it's now five days since I've eaten tofu. I'm crazy about football stickers. We are all fond of them: I have this one, I'm missing this one... I would also like to find a woman like this. But, I can't seem to find her. In a bigoted society, a woman is made to feel ashamed about saying certain things! - I call it a penus, but it's called a... - Thank you. Please continue. It can be a real problem for my boyfriend, sometimes he accuses me... So, how is my favorite patient feeling today? I feel irritated, fed-up, annoyed, bored, exhausted, tedious, exasperated. The concept is very clear! But we can also use less words. Not really. There are 143.000 words in the dictionary. Every word corresponds to something. So, when are you going to let me out of this institute? - Aren't you happy with us, here? - Absolutely ecstatic. A beautiful landscape and some exhilarating companions! If I don't kill myself first, I'll come back next year. You have to be patient, Bea. We made some giant footsteps thanks to the rehabilitative therapy, we can't just interrupt it now. You'll see that time goes by fast. Hello, good evening everyone. Excuse me Doctor, but more than a month has gone by... and, what has happened to Beatrice? Mrs Benassi has decided to interrupt her therapy. I can't say more, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. - How long now? - Only another twenty days. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - He's born? - She is! Sofia. - Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. - Merry Christmas. - Happy Holidays. - Happy Holidays. Sorry, sorry. Beatrice! Bea! I'm Roberto. Roberto Marino! Do you remember Doctor Grimaldi? The pearl necklace! I apologize profusely, but I had some issues lately and I can't seem to remember every man I spend time with... - But, what's wrong with your speech? - Do we know each other? Look in your big red book. There's a picture of me in there. You also remember the existence of a big red book? Yes, I remember it. You can't imagine how long I've been looking for you, Bea! I'm off in five minutes. Can I buy you a drink? I would like that. I really need something fresh to lighten my thirst. I have been sad, not seeing you anymore, so suddenly. - Roberto Marino, right? - Yes. It's weird, I can't find you. Yet your name is familiar. Look better. We talked a lot! To be honest, I even thought... There you are! Precisely, Roberto Marino, yes. We didn't really start off as the best of friends... I have to make my way towards the exit. No, wait. You and I really became friends! Really... Look, it's written "revaluation". No, revaluation is written over the ice cream flavor. - In fact, lemon and coffee, it sucks. - Exactly. - Precisely. You insisted, but I told you so, already. - I'm sorry but I really have to go. - Wait a second. - Please, do not touch me. - I beg you. I'll call the police! Do you understand what you are asking of me? - Consider it a favor. - You call this a favor? - A big favor. - It's called a crime. Break and enter, 614 of the penal code. Anyone caught unlawfully entering a private property... I understand, Francesco. That's why I'm asking you for a favor. If the owner had agreed, I would have knocked. You think asking a cop for this kind of favor is the right thing to do? You are the only one who is capable of accomplishing such a delicate mission. I need someone with special training. Someone who is an expert. A person who is used to dealing with danger. Do you understand? Risky. Very risky. But, I'm asking you for a favor. I need to understand... Show up at the designated place at midnight. Dress dark, no cellphone. It's traceable. No personal vehicles. It's a psychiatrist studio not the Bank of Italy. - You want me to do it or what? - OK, you do it. - Give me back the stamps. - What stamps? - The ones in your pocket! - One. It's just one. - Who did you come dressed as? - Cover me. Keep calm. I can't understand you with the torch in your mouth! It's a double lock key mechanism with an added security block. - We'll need more time. - But, I thought... - Don't distract me. - We just need to... - I'm working here. - But if we... I said don't distract me, I have to concentrate. It's dangerous. Who is it? Mrs Berruti, I'm sorry but it's Robby, can you please open? Thank you. My hands are sweaty, it slipped through my fingers! No! Francesco, it's in there. Don't blind me! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Wait. - All clear? - Yes. - All clear! - Got it. - All clear! - Stop it. Is it there? Here it is. Benassi. "The patient is suffering from a rare disassociation syndrome, if subjected to a powerful and stressful situation, she undergoes an immediate short term memory loss, for a variable amount of time. To help herself psychologically in her everyday life, the patient brings with her, a big red book in which, her whole existence is condensed." "On the 15th of April, the psychological therapy was interrupted due to a sudden attack. After a long recovery period in an appropriate specialized centre, where her memory was artificially reconstructed, the patient is temporarily residing in the private clinic: Villa Maria, via Mario Piccoli 4." - You again! - Wait a second, don't leave! I swear to you that I'll keep my distance. Listen to me. - What do you want? - Taste this. Lemon and coffee. Just a small taste. If you don't like it, I'll leave forever. So, if I don't like it I'll never see you again? - How is it? - It's delicious. This is where we met. I mean, we had first met somewhere else. But this is where we got to know each other better. - Do you remember? - No. We spent the whole afternoon on that bench over there, we ate ice-cream... - Then you told me about Amedeo. - I told you about Amedeo, also. Did I? You just mentioned that you were about to marry each other. Good thing I didn't do so! - You didn't get married? - No. But tell me something about yourself. - Tell me about yourself. - I don't have anything to say. I'm a nobody. I work in the supermarket where we met and I write fairytales. You write fairytales. That's nice. - If you wish, someday I can read you one. - I'd really like that. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Great. So he found her. - Yes, and I'm worried, though. - Worried? I wouldn't want him to have... a blow, a big delusion. What blow? Think positive. Maybe one day the room frees up and... - And... - What do we want to do? - We want to rent it out, right? - Don't be stupid. It could become the kid's bedroom. What are you saying? - It could, right? - Yes, I guess... It could. "Omar, the little kamikaze." That's terrible! Language aside, it's really inappropriate as a children's story. I'm glad you liked it. What about structure? Structure is important. Yes... for you it's even too important. - What do you mean? - Can you tell me the time please? It's 15 minutes to 3 p.m. No, it's quarter to three. No, it's fifteen minutes to the fifteenth hour! - It's the selfsame thing. - The "same" thing. You see, you are a bit tight. Me, tight? I think, it would do you a great deal of good to let yourself go sometimes. I'd like that. If you want, I can help you out. Tomorrow? - Do you mean in 24 hours? - Are you making fun of me? A little. First we need to start from language. You need to start to learn how to speak more normally. Therefore? Imagine you have something in your hand. Suddenly, it falls and breaks in a thousand pieces. What do you say? - Darn! - No, there is a better term: "Fuck!" No, I don't like to use swearwords. No? Let's see. - Let me off! - Let me advise a nice "fuck off". I will never say it! Fuck off! I'm shitting myself! Fuck off! - Put them in jail. - Who? - These bastards! - Great. Bea, that was the real you. Yes! Yes, that's the real me. Fuck off! Yes. Now, let's go to the tunnel of horrors. What happens usually in the tunnel of horrors? Nothing in particular. There's puppets of monsters, of Frankenstein. Then at some point, some loser worker comes from behind and goes... buh! - Is it fun? - It's for kids. To feel scared. But what about if someone is scared as an adult? They go back to therapy with Doctor Grimaldi. But I'm still afraid. There's nothing to be afraid of, let's just stay close, like this. But what if someone apprehends us from behind? What if they apprehend us from behind, you say? We shall use the swearwords that we've learned on roller-coaster. Like what? I think that you could get away with your "fat git!" Wanna try it? Hey you fat git! - No... now try with... Idiot. - Idiot. - You have to sound more convincing. Cretin? - Cretin. - Asshole. - Ass... No, I can't... No... Don't... don't touch me. Bea! - Bea, come on. - No, I really can't do it. Come on, just let go. No, no, I'm completely useless at dancing. It's a big block for me. - That's why we are here. - No, no please. - Come, let's go, come on. - No, wait! Come on. Come on! Ready? - Go! - What shall I do? - Copy me. - I can't! Move your head. - Like this? - Yes, but add in your arms. Bea, move your arms, go, go. You're stuck, free your leg. Lead with your leg, go. Like this? Looks like you're getting rid of an old pair of slippers... I can't do everything together. You need to listen to the music, understood? - Like this? - Yes! Keep going. Much better! - Everybody is looking at me! - Of course they are. Yes! You feel better now? Yes, I owe you my apologies about what I had written in the book... Don't you think it's about time to use it less often? No, I need to find myself, still. You should say I still need to find myself. Look for yourself, but find yourself like you are now and not like ten years ago. You're different now... you dance also! Come on! - What were you like as a child? - Beautiful. Come on! Were you happy? Mostly yes. Until I was eight at least, then less. Why? My mum left and I never saw her again. Lacking care and attention I started to steal things, or eat voraciously and often I would do both. I stole food and then ate it! What are you doing with that thing? - It's a door handle. - I can see that. I passed by the hardware store... Do you need it? - No. There is nothing to open here. - Surely. You really can't remember anything from your past? Sometimes I have some sort of deja vu. But I can't make out if they are dreams or remembrances. Remembrances? That's really poetic! - Are you making a fool out of me, again? - No. You're so antiquated. The sun is about to rise. Well, it's not the first time you've... Robby? - Robby. - Who is it? - What do you want? - Did you screw her? - I said, did you screw her? - Shut up, or you'll wake her up. - Please tell me everything. - Go away. - Tell me what happened. - You need to leave now, Francesco. - Tell me everything. - Go away, I said. We're missing coffee cups. I need you to steal some more. I'm kidding, just tell me what happened. - What do you want me to tell you? - All the details, your approach. - There's nothing to say. - A typical one night stand sex encounter. I haven't brought anyone back home in years. Exactly, you need these one night stands, without a future, without attachments. We'll see her a few more times, and then she's gone into thin air, right? - What are you talking about? - Nothing serious. Be very careful, Roberto! She's the classic type that attaches herself and never lets go. Have you seen her face? She's a loonie. - Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. I'm Francesco. - My pleasure, Bea. - Welcome. Good morning. - Would you like an espresso? - I'd love one, thank you. Here's mine, I haven't drank it yet. - Sugar? - A little. - Is this OK? - Yes, great. Shall I mix it? It's clean anyway. Very clean. Valeria. Bea. - Hello. - Hi, Valeria. Oh my god, excuse me, I'll be right back. You can't imagine how happy I am to see you here! - Robby has told me so much about you. - So we can talk about it later! - Would you also a coffee? - Do you want to give it to her in that glass? I didn't want to give it to her in the eggcup... Of course... - What's up? - It was Lecci, the editor. - He wants to talk to me. - He wants to publish you, then! - He said he hates my fairytales. - He must have changed his mind! I hate your fairytales. That's a concept you have outlined already in the past. - But. - But? Send my son up, please. By chance, yesterday my brainless son red them. - Nice! - Nice. - He finds them exceptional. - So cool. When they arrive on the plastic boat in Lampedusa... that part is dope! You're heavy man! Your fairytales are going round the whole school. So, I've decided to publish them in our teenage collection. - Really? - I share your bafflement. I'll look for a great illustrator immediately and we'll go to press in two months' time. Nice one, dad! WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO GRANDMA? Go! Do it! To the first of a long series of masterpieces. - Masterpieces! Don't exaggerate! - Come on, let's cheer. I want the author's autograph. No, first we have something else to cheer about. We have to make another cheer. Shall you tell them? Valeria, we need your help. Do you think that your flat agency can find us a nice apartment to rent? Roberto and I have decided to go and live together. That's great news! - So, will you help us? - Of course! I've started to work at the school and he has this project. If we don't do it now, we never will. It's a very troublesome moment to find an apartment to rent... Troublesome? Don't exaggerate. We'll find something... She's a home seller, it's her job to find you one, of course. But it's a terrible moment. Over-the-top prices. Why do you have to discourage them? They're in love and they want to live together. It's fantastic. We're renting right here next door, at number 19. Shouldn't be a problem. If they have to be our neighbors, why can't Bea move in with us? Robby's room is free. What are we going to do with an empty room? What are we going to do with it? I was saying as a temporary measure. - We had plans, right? - As an assessment phase... You know what you are? I can't even tell you what you are. Starting tonight, you'll have all the free space you need. - Valeria? - Don't even try and follow me. Excuse me. Bea, we'll speak tomorrow. I'm going to get her. - It's carrot color! - You asked me to. I said I wanted something bright, this is too vivacious. But it's the third time you make me redo it! But this is a color we'll have in front of us for years, centuries. - So what color do you want it? - Wisteria. Wisteria? Oh my god, no! Francesco, not again! I can't take this anymore! Excuse me for a moment, love. Yes, Francesco, what's up? - I feel terrible. - Yes, you've told me already. Be patient, it's just my third phone call today. - It's the sixth time you call me today. - I love her, I love her! You should feel better, you told me you couldn't take it anymore. But, it wasn't true. It was just part of the ripening phase. It's the ripening of love, love is bitter without ripening. I think she is seeing someone else. She has someone else, right? She's got someone else! Excuse me, should you desire, I'm leaving for Cuba. Possibly a couple of weeks there will do you some good. What do you want? Perriconi Enrico, I'm here for my passport. Three pictures, family status and absolutely no confidentialities. - I'm sorry. - I'll call you back in ten minutes. No, I'm busy, so I'll call you back. I'll call you, Francesco, don't... Bea, promise me we will not end up like this. And we'll also have a son? Yes, yes. Of course. - What are we going to call him? - I was thinking like my dad. Giuseppino. Sure, then they'll call him Pino. Your surname is Marino. Pino Marino. - We need something more classic. - I have it: Ruben. - Is that a classic name? - It's a nice name. It's something somewhat reminiscent of his father... It has the R of Roberto and the B of Bea. It's perfect. Try and call him. - Ruben? - Not like that. Louder. - Ruben? - Decisive, otherwise he won't come. - Ruben? - Mum. Here he is! And dad... What about dad? The only variable in the story of good versus evil, is eternity. Say cheese! - I'm going to pick up Ruben. - Yes... - Isn't it early? - I've got to run some errands. OK, I'll see you later. Haven't you noticed anything different about me? - The headband. It's nice. - Ok, see ya. The big red book. Bea! Very good, my love. Excellent. I'll see you later. Good morning, can I help you? I was looking for Herta Muller's latest book. I'm sorry, it's out of stock. But I can order it for you. What would you like me to do, madam? Madam? Francesco, years have gone by and Valeria doesn't want to have anything to do with you, anymore. She'll change her mind now, we're made for one another. Do you remember what you used to say about her? Yes, but they were just phases. It's impossible. She's got someone else now. - They left each other two days ago. - How do you know? "Don't call me anymore, don't send me anymore messages, don't make me have to change my telephone number..." When a woman tells a man these words, it can only mean one thing! How do you know about this conversation? Let it be. I just know. - I can't believe you did it. - War is war. Francesco, you cannot bug Valeria's phone. - Love takes no prisoners. - You're a cop, it's a crime! It's a crime of the heart and a heart crime, is not a crime. - Not a crime. - Ask anyone. - Hello? - You'll see what I'm capable of. - I'll take her back. - I'm coming straight away! And every one of you will have to tell me that I was right. Beatrice didn't pick Ruben up from school. I'll call you later. Ruben was crying because he wanted his mummy, so I called you. You did right. But I don't understand what has happened to Bea. Probably nothing to worry too much about. Ruben, Mum has had a small delay, shall we go home? - Yes. - Let's go. Beatrice Benassi, B of Bologna. Nothing, are you sure? Ametrano, hi, it's Poggi, I'm looking for a missing person. Benassi Beatrice. I don't know about times. You can check from 1 p.m. tomorrow. Lavini, it's inspector Poggi, can you please have a look at the incidents reports from... I don't know if she's been hospitalized there, I'm trying... Height: one-seventy, one-seventy two. She had a yellow headband on. - Nothing. - Did you hear from Valeria? She is the first one I called. She hasn't heard from her in two days. - Did she ask about me? - Francesco... I did not know who else to call. I was hoping you had heard from her. No. Unfortunately not. I don't know what to do, what to tell Ruben. Do you think she could have had another amnesia? Who can say? It's possible, though. - Did she have her big red book with her? - No. She felt serene and decided to leave it at home. Since Ruben was born Bea felt better, she seemed healed. I'm afraid something ugly has happened to her. Roberto, lets not jump to so rushed conclusions. Not even 24 hours have gone by. Let's just wait. - Finished? - Yes. - What about the banana? Yes? Half. I don't want it anymore. OK, let's go to bed. - Say goodnight to auntie. - Goodnight. - 'Night. Run quick to brush your teeth... I'll go. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Come in? - Of course. - Robby? - He's putting Ruben to bed. - Do you know? - What? - Bea... - Yes, of course. Ugly, eh? - I'll bring out a third plate. - No, these are for you two. - But you just cooked... - Yes, but now I'm going. The pasta is ready, it just needs reheated. I'm sorry, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe it's better that I go now. - No, no, I'll leave. - No... I am going now. Tell Robby to call me. Can you please stop it? Lights off, come on, it's late. Is mummy coming to pick me up tomorrow? No, love, Mum is not coming tomorrow either. Not even tomorrow, but why? Do you remember the fairytale I told you about? Round and Round? See, Mum is like Round and Round, now she is going around the world to collect new stories, so when she comes back she'll tell them to us. - What about the song and dances? - Especially the song and dances. - She'll be back soon? - Yes, sweetie, she'll be back soon. If it weren't for him, who know where I'll be right now. He did everything to find me again, everything, and finally he did it. He showed me the letters we wrote each other, and I saw the pictures. He's everything to me, doctor. He's my father, my man, my lover, my everything. Sometimes he can be a bit rigid. But, sometimes, it's the right thing. - So how did it go, love? - Good. I'm happy. The teacher says that my drawing is the most beautiful of all of them. Dad? - What' up, dear? - You weren't listening to me? Sorry, dear! Daddy was distracted. Tell me. I need some colors, some crayons and some pencils. OK. We'll go and buy them straight away. Give me five, first! - Hi. - Hi. - Do you know where the colors are? - Yes. I'm sorry, so sorry. - Ruben! - Dad. - Ruben! - Dad. Dad! Beatrice? Are you with us? Excuse me, I was somewhere else for a second. Congratulations on the Sacher cake, it's delicious. Cooking is my passion, after Beatrice, that is. We know it. You are the brain, Beatrice is the hand. - Bea, it's delicious. - Thank you. So, is everything ready for the wedding? Yes, almost. Aside a few minor details, right? Where are you going to spend your honeymoon? I'm taking Beatrice on a photographic safari in Africa. - That should be wonderful. - For fuck sake. I'm so sorry, I don't know what got into me. I'm going to the bathroom. Dad? - Can you come and play with me? - Yes, love. Daddy is going to finish off shaving and is coming straight away. I'm coming. - I found her. - Who? - Bea. - I don't quite understand you. - I know where Bea is! Let me explain better, come here. - Hi. - Hi. - What do you mean by "I found Bea"? - Calm yourself down. - She's fine, at least I think so. - Where is she? It plopped on my desk today. A passport renewal request, in her name, from Switzerland. From Switzerland? And from the same place another renewal request arrived in the name of Amedeo Bartolomei. Does it remind you of anyone? Amedeo is her ex-husband. But what does that have to do with anything? Do you know anything else about Amedeo? Absolutely anything at all? His family owned a watch factory, I think. Is this the factory? I don't know. - What shall I do. Call? - What if it's not him? I'm going to call him. Bartolomei headquarters, good evening. Hi, I was looking for Mr Bartolomei. He is not here. He'll be back in a few days. May I speak to Mrs Beatrice, then? - Mrs Beatrice, you say? - Yes. Usually at this time, everyone has gone home, but let me try for you. Yes? Hello, who is it? Hello? - It's Robby. - Robby? It's me... Roberto. Roberto who, I'm sorry but do we know each other? No, maybe not. I'm calling from Rome. How may I be of assistance to you today? I wanted to order some watches... They put you through the wrong number. This is the admin office. I'll put you through the sales team right away. Goodbye. Sleep here tonight, and leave tomorrow morning, OK? No, I'm going now. - Do you want me to come with you? - No, I'm going on my own, thank you. - Robby, what are you looking for? - Bea's book. It's not here. Ruben. Ruben? Did you see Mum's big red book? Darling, did you see Mum's big red book? Why are you not talking to me, Ruben? Did you see Mum's big red book? It's underneath the bed. Thank you, sweetie! Listen darling, Daddy is coming back tomorrow. - Be a good boy and stay with auntie Valeria, OK? - Yes. Bye. Possibly at this time there is less traffic leaving Rome. Yes, that's true. OK... I'm off. If you haven't eaten already, I made some pesto. Yes, I haven't eaten yet. For lunch I just had a small sandwich. So, Ruben, here we have different options, you choose. There's the recently fired fairy on benefits tale, always a classic. The forest of the frozen hobos. The little factory worker. No, I want a nice story. One that ends well. Your father doesn't write stories with happy endings. Let's see, there's Alice in the land of the earthquake survivors, maybe... No, I know it already, and I don't like it. So, I don't know. Here's one I don't know, let's try with this one. Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, a prince and a princess lived in two far away places, but were part of the same fairytale, even if they didn't know it, yet. Until one day someone decided that it was time for them to meet. A wizard, you would say? A malevolent witch? No, much more, a psychotherapist. A sweet psychotherapist with silver white hair. From that day onwards, they got to know each other, through many adversities, they learned to protect themselves and had a beautiful child. But things are never as we want them to be and destiny still had something else in mind for them. The princess fell under a powerful spell that erased all of her memories and she disappeared. The prince began to look for her everywhere. On roller-coaster, on the flower bench, in a tub of ice cream. Lemon and coffee flavor. Until one day, by chance, in a small inn of a lonesome town where he had stopped to rest, a weird big man, a very big tall man approached him... his eyes were benevolent even if he didn't look too intelligent. He was also a loner, alone, very alone. He told him about himself and the legend of the land without time. A desolate region where he lived, deprived of love. The prince didn't hesitate and exited the inn, jumped on his horse charging away like lightning, determined to get his princess back, in that forsaken land. The end is missing... You would make an excellent dad. You think? No... Good morning, I'm Roberto Marino. I wanted to speak to Mrs Benassi. Benassi Beatrice. - Do you have an appointment, sir? - Yes, at nine. - At sixteen past nine. - Please wait a moment. Madam, Mr Marino is here. Yes, Marino. Third floor, fourth room, and you'll find the elevators there. Yes? Hello. I'm Roberto Marino. Please sit down. Tell me. I am a fairytale writer for children. I am looking for a sponsor, you see, for... for a new publication. We make watches, so I don't see how we could... But, it's a love story, taking place in a watchman's shop, between a beautiful pendulum... and a wristwatch. It's funny. I'm sorry, but we've never done anything like this. I understand. OK. At least I tried. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye... - Mr Marino. - Yes? I was thinking that even though we've never done it... it could very well be a good opportunity for our business. But you have failed to mention the fairytale's title. Mr Stealer and Missy Forgetful. - Mr Stealer and Missy Forgetful. - Yes, yes... The pendulum is Missy Forgetful because she always forgets about time and the wristwatch, he's Mr Stealer. What does he steal? He steals... He's always stealing time as he is always forward. - So he's not that great of a watch. - No. In fact, they always feel left out because... because they are considered out of time, but they're not that concerned with other people's opinion. Because they love each other very much. Excuse me, I don't know what is happening to me, it's weird... - I feel ridiculous, but... - No. No. - Would you like a coffee? - Yes. I would prefer an ice cream. Coffee flavor. Lemon and coffee. I know a place near here. - Would you like to go? - Yes, let's go. - It's nice here. - All in order. I had imagined Switzerland to be a little different. - Different, how? - I don't know with snow at least... - But it's spring time! - Yes, the snow has melted already. Yes, it's melted away.
