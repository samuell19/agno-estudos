No~! No~! I wanna go~! No!! No!! I wanna go see the moon rocks! There's nothing I can do... What is this place? The World's Fair. The World's Fair? In 1970, the World's Fair, Expo '70, was held in Osaka, Japan. With Progress and Harmony for Mankind as the theme, 77 countries around the world attended the event, along with many private corporations. Within 6 months, the number of visitors reached... ...64,210,000 people?!?!?! WOAH!! That's more than half the population of Japan! This boasts the highest attendance record of the World's Fairs. This is also probably one of the greatest events for Japan... As expected of Mum! Ancient things are her forte, aren't they? Of course not! It's all written here in this book. It also says that, there's just too much to see... ...and that one couldn't possibly finish it all in a day! Japan Pavilion There are a lot of people lining up over there! I heard that people had to line up for hours just to get into the popular pavilions! Oooh! Someone's signing autographs! Mum! Famous people! No, that's not it! It was rare for us to see foreigners at that time... That's why it was popular to ask regular foreign tourists or pavilion hostesses for their autographs. Hostesses? Like the ones Dad likes? Yes, yes... No! Not those kind of hostesses! Let's see, I think they were typically called "companions". Oh look! That's them over there! OOOH! I like them too! COMPANION!!! Hello! Tallo! Okamoto Tarou! [Note: Okamoto Tarou was a famous post-war artist who designed the tower of the sun that was the centerpiece of Expo '70.] My name is Nohara Shinnosuke. I love you, Tameno Yuu~ Bonjour! Hi. Hey companions, can you sign this for me? My underpants that is... Mum! I want a pen!! I'M SORRY! MY KID IS SORRY! I'M A BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WIFE! PRETTY, SEXY, FINE THANK YOU!! Oh! So intense! By the way, what are we doing here anyway? Your Dad said he wanted to come here. Eh? Where's Dad then? He should already be here... Everyone, please take note. A beast is currently approaching the fairgrounds. We would like everyone to please leave the fairgrounds immediately. A ball to be opened 5,000 years hence... Time Capsule We would like everyone to please leave the fairgrounds immediately. We would like everyone to please leave the fairgrounds immediately. Repeating the announcement. A beast is currently approaching the fairgrounds. We would like everyone to please leave the fairgrounds immediately. Shinnosuke, now it's our turn! [Note: The following sequence is a parody of Ultraman.] Oooh! Roger! The World Fair Defence Team to the rescue! It's Hiroshi here. The beast is moving from the Japanese Garden to the Soviet Pavilion. Go attack it. I will be there immediately. Alright! Let's go! Shinnosuke! Alright!! Alright!! Crayon Shin-chan Storms are brought! Really intense! The Adult Empire Strikes Back! No No No No All adults say is No No No No No No No No No No Not again, Shin-chan No No, this is how you have to do it, No No No No No No Even thought I don't want to do it like everyone else, No No No No No No No No A mistake-ridden attack of many No Nos DO AS I SAY! No No No, Can't do that No No No, Can't do this EH?! WHY!? No No No, Can't do that. Can't do this sometimes Isn't that just whatever's convenient for adults? Leaving my green peppers... YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED! Chatting up these ladies... YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED! Wearing panties!! YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED! I gotta tidy up. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED! I was seriously gonna do it too... Something's weird~ Adults are weird~ No No No No All adults say is No No No No No No No No Hey, Hey Shin-chan with big eyes, No No No No No No Stop nagging me! No No! Demon No No, should I say something? No No No No No No No No I'm just gonna try hard... as of tomorrow... It's so scary! Run! Move it! Move it! Misae's more violent than any beast!! You'll get beaten up! Do YOU wanna get beaten up, HUH??? OOH!! It's the companiooons! That fool! Our duty comes first! It's big! Big! Misae's ass, that is! Where the hell are you looking at?! Damn beast, how can it disrupt people's progress and harmony like that?! Take this! Let's start our attack, Shinnosuke! The Soviet pavilion has been destroyed!! WOAH! There's a beast here too! Let me see... No. That's the Gas pavilion. Gas? And that's the United States Pavilion. It says the moon rocks are in there. Ooh! It's like the Tokyo Dome! Argh! The moon rocks! I haven't seen them yet! Why you...!! Unforgivable!!! Dad! Dear! Damn it!!! Ah! Hiroshi Sun is here! Hiroshi Sun is here! [Note: "Sun" here plays on the centerpiece of the Expo, the tower of the Sun. Also, Ultraman's power is derived from the Sun.] It's just Dad... No. The "Sun" in "Hiroshi Sun" is "Taiou" but in English! [Note: Also, "Sun" sounds like the honorific "-san" which is used as a pun.] He came from outer space, an invincible hero! We're counting on you, Hiroshi Sun~! Take care of the beast for us~! Dad, that's not fair!! I wanna play too!! Damn you, damn you beast! Let's have a challenge! Hey Shinnosuke, enough of your nonsense. Sorry. Can we have a "cut"? Cut! Maybe he got a little excited... You cannot run out like that. Dad, let me at him! Kid, you are so strong. Sorry. Come over here quick! Sorry. Excuse me. Alright. Get ready... Start! Ah! Hiroshi Sun is charging his Solar energy! There it is! The Expo beam! Incredible! The fallen pavilions have returned to theur original state! This way, the World's Fair can continue without incident! Thank you, Hiroshi Sun! You have saved the World's Fair! Alright, thank you! Good work everyone! Good work! After I've finished editing the video, I'll mail it to you. Okay, thanks. Here, take this as a souvenir Thank you very much! Hehe! I got it!! Ahhh, that was so embarassing! Really? You acted so well, Misae! How come only Dad got the lead?? What's more, a hero of justice normally wears a mask! But...if I wore a mask, no-one would know it was me. Well, I'm up next. Go change, everybody. What!? What do you mean by "What!?"??? You promised, right? I guess so. Are you going to the human world no matter what? [Note: The following sequence is a parody of Mahoutsukai Sally.] Yes, father. I want to go to the human world and befriend the humans. If you go, your young siblings will be very sad. Don't cry for me, young siblings... I want to be the bridge between the world of magic and the human world. Excuse me, can we have a "cut"? Okay. Okay, let's continue with the acting. We'll use roses next time. It must be expensive. Thank you. This is the list of "memorable TV programs" and stories for easy searching. If the guest requests, we can also make an original story too. Ah! This is so nostalgic! That's for sure! I'll have to trouble you then!! Sure. Have a nice time. See you later, and behave! Bye~ Yo! Yo, yo. Everyone's gathered around, what's going on? Everyone's in the same boat you are. We've been running into each other recently. Ah! That's mine. It's free. Why can't you get one for yourself? That's because I only want Kazama's! This is great! You can eat as many sweets as you want! And also do what you want! He's still as carefree as ever. Hey, the adults seem to be acting strange ever since this museum of the 20th century started. There's no need to be like that even though they miss their childhood. Yeah, it really is too much for them to be like this! My mum was playing with her dolls a few days ago. See? My mum speaks baby talk from time to time. It isn't just our mums too. Even our teachers are into it. Are old memories really that great? Who knows? You'll only get it if you are an adult. Yeah. Don't worry. You'll understand it later. It'll be way too late by then! If this continues, mum will not be mum anymore. Yes, is this your first time here? To the museum of the 20th century...? Shops here sell everything from the 20th century. There's also wide open spaces for you to enjoy all your old memories. As well as a studio where you can become... ...the hero or heroine you admired in your childhood. There are also restaurants that serve memorable food, where guests can all reminisce their past memories. Reclaim your childhood self, and have fun to your heart's content. Welcome to the museum of the 20th century! Ahh! That was fun! I'm so glad that the museum of the 20th century was built in Kasukabe! It was no fun at all! Only you guys had all the fun. You do all that shopping and stuff! Can't you take us somewhere different?!?!?! There are a lot of antique cars out these days. Maybe everyone thinks they don't have to limit their play to just at the museum of the 20th century. That's so cool! How about we change to an antique car as well. Yeah, why don't we. There are lots of records here. Whoa! Beautiful! Kasukabe is getting more and more fun! Nohara Hiroshi Misae Shinnosuke Himawari Hey, Dad. Come on, Hiro-Sun! [Note: "Hiro-Sun" is also a paly on "Hero-san"] Oi! I want to watch the Action Kamen video! No. We have to watch my Majokko Sayuri movie next. [Note: Majokko = Magical Girl. ] I want to see Action Kamen. Shinnosuke, you must watch too. This is much better than Action Kamen. Himawari, you must watch Majokko Sayuri with Mummy later, okay? Hey, aren't they advertising about the museum of the 20th century on TV later on? Oh yeah, about what time? In another 30 minutes. The 21st century will end in another 20 minutes time. It went by so fast. Long enough for me. The stench from the 21st Century, is just too much for me. I just hope it'll end soon. It can. Ken, the smell you created of the 20th century... ...is what all the parents can't stop thinking about. Of course. Everyone wants to go back... to the 20th century. The future will be destroyed soon. The future is now. The DREAMS of the 21st century that we all had... Summon the different branches around the world. Yes. Please take note, this is Kasukabe HQ. This is from the leader, listen up. Go on. Our project "Yesterday Once More" shall make its first step. Our generation, the golden 20th century will revive itself. All plans are in place. Tomorrow shall be a busy day. It'll be really intense. Do your best, my comrades! That is all. Everyone, let's get back to work. Shall we watch from here? Let's go back, back to our town. Welcome...Bargain prices! Bargain prices! How is it? I'll give it to you cheaper. A new batch of croquettes fresh from the fryer! Get 'em while they're hot! [Note: Croquettes are deep fried dumplings made with ground beef in mashed potatoes, battered with egg and covered with bread crumbs. ] Sunset Town Ginza Shopping District [Note: Ginza is a High Class Restaurant/Shopping District in Tokyo. ] I feel so relieved when I come here. This place doesn't have unnecessary things, unlike the outside world. Long ago, when the outside world had the same appearance as this town... ...people were full of dreams and hopes. The 21st century used to be so shiny. But all that's left in Japan now, is smelly money... ...and rubbish that we can't burn. Is this really the 21st century? Everyone is feeling empty, that's why... We try to satisfy ourselves with material things. That's why we keep buying things we do not need. The world is becoming uglier and uglier. We have corrected it back to the way it was. Let everyone in Japan... like the people in this town... ...return to the place that's filled with hopes. Return to a plae where we believe in the future. How I wish the outside world was like this. That day will come. It makes my heart ache. What greatness! The museum of the 20th Century Things will go back to the way it was tomorrow morning. Let us all happily pass this time together. What was that just now? Was that all? Get ready for tomorrow. Sleep early. Yes. You're going to sleep? Aren't we going to have dinner? Hey mum! I am so hungry. Hey mum!! What's this? Spring onion. Dad! Mum! What are you guys doing?! How can you have tidbits in the morning?!? Shut up! I'm hungry damn it! I am hungry too!! Mum, why aren't you making food for us?! Why should I? Do it yourself. What the hell?! Stop screaming all the time! That's my special Royal Chocobi!! Don't open it without my permission!!! GEEZ!! Dad and Mum are so weird!! Go back to normal now! Make us food. Clean your teeth and wash your face!!! No. Change your clothes, go shave and get to work!!! No. What? It's not a holiday today, right? Is it okay for you not to go to work? Stuff like morning meetings or rounds to make or clients to entertain? Oi! Who made the rules that adults HAVE to go to work? A decision by Parliament? EH?? Forget it! I have to go to kindergarten! Yes, go, go. Go wherever you want! You don't have to come back either. Damn it! What's wrong with them? Why is the bus so slow? Oh, there, there. Be good... Don't cry. They'll come for us soon, right? Let's go. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... Kagome, kagome. The bird in the cage. When, when... Futaba Kindergarten Okay~! Let's play~! Rock, paper, scissors! Hey, Hey! Let's see who'll lose! Let's see who'll lose! Hey! Hey!! This time... Who's he? I forgot. If I remember correctly, he's Shi... Shi... Shintaro? Yes, yes. It's Shintaro. I am Shinnosuke, dumbasses! Don't go and make that mistake on purpose!! It wasn't on purpose~! Don't bother us, Shintaro. Come on! Shoo! Shoo!!! Like we'd ever be friends with the likes of you, Shintaro. 1, 2, 3, 4... Miss Nanako!! Don't go and skip your job at the kindergarten! It's Mum and Dad. Mum, Dad, where are you going? Mum! Dad! Speak to me! Don't ignore me! The adults of Kasukabe have disappeared. Just where did they go? They probably all went to the museum of the 20th century... Why did they go there? To have fun, of course! They don't want us anymore! EH?! I don't want that... I wonder if the adults really went there to play? They won't secretly be creating a world without kids, will they? OH!! An Adult Empire! An Adult Empire? What about the kids? Shiinosuke! Please be serious! No matter what others say, I'll believe my parents. Don't worry. They will come back soon! Oh! You too, Bo-chan?!?! Grab... an... ass. Emergency interruption. At about 9am today... A massive disappearance occurred around the nation. This is really unbelievable. In a word, chaos. Witnesses have seen... It wasn't just Kasukabe!! ...a lot of empty cars. This is most likley related to the disappearing event. The police has began checks. What actions will giant man take? A slash to the cervical vertebrae. He must be getting serious. The masked man strikes back. The masked man... is incredible. Why are they playing such an old program? Let's watch the other channels. Eh? Eh? How come? I'm really sorry. They're all showing old programs. We are arranging the arena now Welcome the God of the Arena... I am hugnry. Me too. It's already the afternoon, isn't it? Let's go out to look for some food! I am scared! You should have some food over at your place. My Dad and Mum finished everything off. The convenience stores in the neighbourhood should have lots of food. You can't enter. Why? Yeah! Let us go in! There's no food here! There's heaps of it! I can see it! None of it is for the likes of you! What did you say?! If you don't leave, I'll show you what we're made of! They're pissing me off! What the hell was that? Bullies! What should we do? I have a good idea! Alright, retreat. It's Chocobi... Hey, help me out for just a little while. What are you doing?! You'll be discovered if you stay! Who's that? Search! Maybe it's those little brats from just now! They might have snuck in!! Over there. Catch them! Everyone, escape! Hold it!!! So this is all that's left. Everything else fell out during our escape. I guess this will hold us for a while. That won't do at all... I am so sorry, Himawari. That bugger Kazama is just too useless. You're saying it's my fault? Dear, don't you feel pity for this child? Stop this. This is too tiring. Damn it!! What's the use of studying so much, if you don't have street smarts? Forget it, I am going back to work. I don't care even if you find yourself a new guy. Oi!! Wait!!! I am sorry... Kazama... I was just kidding! Just kidding... L-Let's go to that shop. There may be something to eat. Here, have more. It's on us today! It's my first time here, I feel so anxious... Oh? It's your first time? You must come more often in future! Ahh! Delicious! I was so thirsty. Sorry. There's only Oolong tea. I'll give you some wine in 15 years time. Somehow, Ne-ne looks so much older. What's that for? She's a newbie as well. What's up with the act? It's still too early for you! I'll never give up the number 1 spot to you! There's no need to give it up! I'll just take it from you! SILENCE!! Wait, what are you guys doing?? Alright! Again! Masao! This is just Oolong tea. You! That's right! Like there's anyone else! Take your hands off that girl. There are kids looking! Geez! Stop it! You are all acting strange. Pfft! Women are all the same!! Are you even listening?? Really! For whose sake did I become a mama for? Right, Bo-san? I only love mama! Bo-san... Mama! Damn it! I won't allow that! How old are you? 5. Eh? So young... Please! Don't throw me aside!! What are we doing? Is it because of the shop's atmosphere? Maybe it was the smell of alcohol. I think I have a hangover. Being an adult is so fun! Are the adults not back yet? Why did the electricity get shut down? Maybe because all the adults are gone. I'm sure there's no one at the place where electricity comes from either! Probably the same with the gas and water works... I've never heard of that sort of music before. Maybe it's some old songs. They must have gained control of the radio station as well. Sorry for the interruption We shall now broadcast the news from the museum of the 20th century. Good evening, good children. I am the leader of 'Yesterday Once More', Ken. Yesterday Once More? Your parents are all over here at the museum of the 20th century. They are enjoying themselves living in the past. Time has begun to move backward, and shall never again move forward. You have no future anymore. There'll be a cart coming to fetch you. Get on it. You can get hot food over here. And you can see your papa and mama too. If you don't come, you'll be marked as traitors. They shall start catching people starting tomorrow morning. The ones caught won't be allowed to see their papa or mama as well. You're free to make your choice. But I like kids who are good boys and girls. Hey all you good kids, come on out. Follow us to find your parents. Come on, quickly. Alright, line up properly now. Make more room there in the back. Masao, be quiet. Why are you not going with them? You get to see your parents! I want to see them too, but... ...don't you find it strange that they sent a car for us? Yeah, I agree! They abandoned us just this morning. Maybe it's a trap! They said they'll be coming again tomorrow morning. Yeah, it'll be by force next time. Anyhow, we must find a place to hide. I know of a good place! Will the kids really get to see their parents? No. I think they'll be put into isolation. They must be taught, and they'll have to lose the smell of the 21st century... Then, they'll become a citizen of that place. What about those who disobey us? Who knows? You mean, this is the place?? Yes. This is the place. I guess this place is well stocked up, and does have a lot of hiding places as well. See? Just once I've wanted to stay over at a department store. [Note: These lines were popular phrases from the comedians of the period that's untranslatable to English. ] Sorry to impose on you. It's so surprising! Whatthehellareyoudoin? Gachooon! You didn't ring for me? Oh my, excuse me! Did you get it? While I was watching the sunset, Ma was having heartburn. That's really tough! We shall start the child hunt now. Everyone shall go to Kasukabe... ...to catch those little brats. We must capture all of them. Why do I have to go too?!?! Because your kid is not here yet. But it's not only mine that's not here yet!! I am so sleepy right now, I don't want to go into the outside world!! I'll give you something good if you manage to get them. A Missing Child Badge! I want that! Give it to me. Please! With this, you can get unlimited access into the Expo '70 room. I'll give one to the rest of you as well. But, you must bring the kids here in exchange. Let's go. Alright. It's morning already... That's right! The adults will be coming at 8 o'clock. We can't sleep anymore. Geez! You make too much noise in the morning! Oh no! It's already 8 o'clock!! Why did it ring so late? Geh! Shinnosuke!! Oh~ Good morning~ You set the timer, right? Not too early... Not too late... Just right at 8 o'clock. What's the point in that??? The adults are coming to capture the kids at 8 o'clock! Which means, we have to leave before 8 o'clock to avoid being captured! The adults are coming at 8 o'clock. And we just woke up at 8 o'clock! It's too late to leave now! Damn~! DON'T JUST END IT WITH "DAMN~"!!! The principal is over there. Do your best! Ahh!! They got caught! At this rate, we'll also be... Look. The adults are coming! It's stil warm. They must still be nearby. Excellent! This is a good hiding spot, isn't it! But, no matter how you look at it, it's just too small! I'm in hell... Crap! Be quiet! Are they gone? Hey, hey, Kazama... What? If you wanna go, you call it 'pee', right? So what? Well, what do you call if you have to let out gas? That is... Fart. Oh! Fart, fart! Hey... don't tell me... Yep! No! If you let it out, we'll sure be discovered. It'll be fine, don't worry. It'll just make a small sound. Oh come on everyone. You exaggerate too much! Huh? Dad! I've found the brats! Dad! Stay put, you damn kids! Don't even think of escaping! Damn this stinks! What is this?! Oh... I can't get out... Stay where you are!!! Damn brats! I'll definitely catch you! Ah ha! I found you! Be good, okay... Mum! Himawari! Whose baby is this? Let go of me! If you don't let go, I'm not liable for my actions! Oi!! Let go of me! Himawari! Oi!! Let go of me! Stay put you damn brats! We'll never get away now. Let's hide out above until the number of adults lessen. Where did they go? Take a look there. It's no good. There are more and more of them. Oh! I've thought of a good idea! Let's use the bus to get away! What are you talking about? How can kids drive? I... ...know how... ...maybe... I've always paid attention to how the principal drives. Bo-chan! Let's go! Roger! It's impossible!! The brats are up there! Second gear! Yep! Give me back my bus! Fire!! You've done it now!! What?! Come on! Come on! Come on! Stop it. Don't fight amongst yourselves. Everyone, calm down. Move! Move!! Stop! They have injured my soul... Unforgivable! Capture all of them! Yes. Are the adults still on our tail? Oh, not at the moment. It's okay. Fourth gear! Yes. Eh? Shinnosuke! The clutch! I don't wanna do such a boring job! And no fair, Bo-chan! You keep hogging the wheel... That's unfair! Fair enough. Alright, let's start a rotation. Masao shall get the first round. Masao fight!! It's okay!! I like this boring job. This is your chance to get others to notice you. It's okay! I don't need that! Hurry! Okay! Th-Th-Th-They're here!! I don't wanna!! I'll kick the crap out of you all, baby! Come on! Come on! What are you doing? I can't help it!! Wait. I have a good idea. Attack! Hold on tight, everyone. Alright, let's do it now! We succeeded. Yeah! Change drivers! Can I increase the speed? You can't. That's because the speed limit is at 40km/h. Must keep to the rules. But we will get caught this way! I've discovered the brats' tracks. What are you doing??? Even if we may get caught, I still can't disobey the road rules! But you don't have a license anyway! ARGH!!! That's right! I am condemned anyway! The wheel! The wheel!! Change drivers! I want to be known as a bus guide, not a bus driver! That's right, a bus guide as pretty as Ayumi Hamasaki. Everyone, thank you for choosing the Futaba Tour Bus services for today. Miss bus attendant. I have been waiting so long for you. Thank you for your oyaji-gag support. Please look to the left. There are many weirdos seated in the vehicle beside us. Please look to the right. There are many bad adults staring at us. We should smile up to them at this point. Get ready... What are they doing? Jack is on a peak, atop the lofty thousand Alps~ Come on everybody, let us dance the Alpine dance~ Change driver. Finally! My turn! Let's go, Shin-mobile! Ohhh~ This takes up all my time. Relax... Relax... Transform! Save me! T-Thank you. My bus! I won't be defeated by something like this! Magical girl, Misarin. Feel the power of my magic of justice! I shall punish you! Mum, you forgot something. Success! I wanna pee. Shiro~ Beg, Shiro. I wanna pee so bad! So help me drive for a while. Heh. You can't escape any longer! The skies are crystal blue... I-It can't be... Damn! How can they treat my 2000GT like that?! Ohh~ Here it comes... Here it comes... That felt so good... Oh no! The bus is headed towards the museum of the 20th century now! Hey, hey! There's no point running away now. We'll go to the museum of the 20th century then! Alright. Let's go. We can see our parents there. Okay! I understand! I'm in too! In that case, let's get the adults back as well! The Kasukabe Defence Team... Fire!! ROGER!! Look! Shut the main gates. Yes! The attack is a success. Well done! Shiro is the best dog in the world! How can it get to this stage?! This is so humiliating, isn't it? I've surrounded the pesky brats. It can be counted a success! Give me that! We just want to see our parents! There's no point. Your parents have already gone back to the past because of its smell. The tally doesn't add up. Hey, what about that foul-mouthed kid? These are all of the ones we found inside. That's impossible! Over there! Wait you stupid brat! This is so tiring. I really dislike the outside world. Lock them in the kids' room. Yes. What is it, Shiro? I've seen this sign before... No... I wanna see my moon rocks! Hiroshi, you're so unreasonable! Why do you want to line up for 3 hours just to see a bunch of rocks? You might as well come with me to the other pavilions to see some pretty companions. Dear! How can you say such things?! They're not just ordinary rocks! They're rocks from the moon. Apollo brought them back. Dad! I came to fetch you! Let's go home. Are you talking to me? Who are you? It's me, Dad. Dad, it's a weird child. I am not weird. It's me, Shinnosuke! Dad! Mum! Where are you going? It's you, Dad. Let go of me! I am not your Dad! Your parents have already... ...gone back to the past becasue of its smell. That's the smell! It's so smelly! Oh! Give it back! Smelly... Dad, you are my Dad! Do you remember this smell? Dad, do you remember me? It's so smelly! Dear, Shin-chan, Himawari, Shiro! Is it really that bad?! Very smelly. Really very smelly. Misae, let's change. We have to get out of here! That was rather interesting. It's you! We want to leave here. I have something to tell you. Come with me! The sunset will let others think of the past. That's why it's always evening down here. I can't believe this is inside a building! It really feels like we're back in the past. Just like a movie setting. No matter how good it looks. It's still a fake. But the citizens here and us don't think it's a fake. Citizens? Are they really living their lives here? To us, this is reality. And the outside world, is the fake world. Because there is no smell there. Smell? The smell of the past... and I obtained that smell. How is that possible? And you went berserk because of that smell. All the citizens here love this place. To remain in the unchangeable past... ...this place is fully surrounded by that smell of the real past. No wonder this place smells so nostal-- That was a close shave. You can go back. Yes. Come in. This apartment is so old. Is this where you live? Right. Be careful. I am back. We have a guest. Welcome. She is called Chako. How are you? Watch yourself. Is tea okay? Yes, yes, anything will do. Me too. Are you a couple? No. You look like you are cohabiting. Drink up. And afterwards, with the advent of this event, our town created a scent of nostalgia. Then, we make use of the tower to let out the scent, and let it envelop the whole country. Our Smell index has already reached its highest peak. Next, if we press this switch, the tower will effectively spread the intensely nostalgic smell out. The people will become a victim of the past then. Though everything appears to be the same on the surface... But everyone is already filled with longing for the past. The following program on the Yuuhichou local television station is... Once I finish my drink, I shall climb up to the tower... And press that switch. This time, even smelly feet won't be able to shock you back. Why you!! And just when we got our family back together! If you really want to live in the 21st century... ...then go. Let us see your future. Hurry! If you drag on, the smell will get to you again. What should we do? What should we do about the smell? Relax, nothing can be worse than Dad's feet. OF COURSE! No matter what, we have to destroy that machine first. Nohara family, FIRE!! Fire!!! What do you intend to do? I haven't been running a lot recently. What should we do? Should we look for the elevator? No, we may get trapped in the elevator! What? Then... Didn't our parents give us a pair of legs? You're kidding! There they are! Welcome back! Defending your country must be tiring. You must be hungry. Come and have some food. We are having curry rice tonight. Really! It's the smell of curry. I am so hungry! Dad! Mum! Ah! That was a close shave. We're pressed for time. Bye! You will regret this~! They've appeared!! IDIOT!! BE CAREFUL! Whoa, it's like an old anime! This brings back memories. No... Damn, return the bike to me! Ohh! Dad's a delinquent! Thank you! Get on. Let me borrow it for a while. Eh?? W-Where are you going? To the 21st century! Damn! Why does this place bring back so many memories? What's up with you? You can't drive with people sitting at the back. Oi! Where is the exit?? Hurry up! Otherwise I'll go crazy because I miss the past so much! Alright! Let's set off. Yes! Stop! What, you can't handle it? We have to climb some more... I have no confidence. You must go! Our future depends on this. Climb! It's so scary. Don't look down! What is it? Damn! Dad, over here! Okay! I don't wanna. I can't! You must! Be careful! Let me carry Himawari. Faster! Why must it be hollow at the bottom? Here they come! Come on and have some of this! Fool! No provocation! Look! Faster! Wait!! If you stop, you'll be captured! Misae, go. I don't want to!!! Go! They are coming! Faster! Oh~! Mum looks so happy. I'M GONNA DIE!!!!!!! They are coming. Fool! Don't come over! Shinnosuke, go! Okay. That's cheating! Misae, faster!! Let go of me!! Misae, take care of Himawari... Dear, are you okay? Oh no! Dad's in trouble! I'm coming!!! Dad, I'll save you! Mum, thank you for your leg. Just my leg? My balls retracted just then. It was my first experience... Misae. Mum's leg, you must win! Grab hold of my hand. I thought I was going to die!! Did they retract?? Shinnosuke!!! Yes. Go back. Oh! Roger! You guys... Misae's got a big ass. Go everyone, move out of the way! It's not just big, it's got 5 days worth of constipation!! Move away, quickly! Mum's ass... Stop talking about my ass! The ass, it's coming! Why you~~!!!!! Stay put! I am going! That was so scary! Are we really alive? I want my balls to retract again... That's enough from you! Alright, they'll chase after us. Come on. Okay! They at it again?! It's them! It's just the two of them. Just the two? It's a good chance. Hey Dad... Dad... You can see her underwear! Really? Fool, what are you looking at? Come on, quick! Don't you want to turn back? No! I want to live in the future with my family. Right! What a pity, Hiroshi Nohara. It must have been a boring life. Go! After him! Dear! Dad! Go----! They are getting away! My life was not boring! Let go! You all wish to be happy with your families too, right?! Ken, hurry up and get this guy to let go! It's just a lone opponent and you can't even deal with him! I saw them! Oh, how intense! You finally got some humanity in you! That hurts! Damn! How can you peep into Miss Chako's underwear? What colour were they?!!! It's white. White! Mum! Don't stop! Hurry up and go. Faster! Damn! No. Look, the smell index. After looking at them, the others want to live in the 21st century as well. No... It can't be. Has our city turned against us? That's it. It's been hard on everyone. It's up to you how you want it now. We just want others to live well even if they get outside. Why? Why? Reality is ugly. This is a fact. That's because I wanna live with... ...Dad, Mum, Himawari and Shiro. Even if we quarrel, I want to live with them too! Also... I want to grow up. I want to grow up and get to know many pretty women like you! This is the end, huh? Yes. The 20th century is over. But I will not go to the outside world. Alright. Kid, I shall return your future to you. Shinnosuke! Shinnosuke! Are you okay? It looks like we succeeded. Yes! It seems so. You are great! The uniformed men suddenly retreated, so I was worried that maybe-- What about those two? The smell has diappeared. The others will recover soon. Good bye. Don't tell me you guys are... Don't come over. You cheaters! I don't wanna die! Yet... another family hindering us! Cheaters! You two were going to go bungy jumping all by yourselves. Let me play too! No. We're not going to do it anymore. Why? Afraid? Did your balls retract? Yes. What about the two of them? Who knows? Maybe they went to live some place else. Hey, Dad! Dad! That girl was so pretty! Yeah, really! What the hell are you talking about?! Hey, it's Kasukabe! Finally back. Our home sweet home. We are back! We are back! Welcome home, Dad, Mum! Hey, Mother. Do you remember? The sports day's... lunch? That fried egg was great. The one you woke up early just to make. I want to eat it again~ Even so, Mother... The first... school performance day... I was playing... a frog... I messed up a line and I almost cried... But when I saw you in the crowd... I was relieved~ After all this time, I can finally say... Thank you~ Forever... forever... Please stay happy~ Even when I become a mother. Stay happy forever~
