They come from somewhere slightly deeper within the soul than the level of a pure hit factory. I think Cliff's latest single is a work of genius, a perfect pop song, but this lot are doing the same kind of thing, they're using melody and rhythm in a hypnotic way, but because it's slightly sinister and Gothic, it won't be played, which seems a shame. ♪ And she turned around and took me by the hand ♪ And said, I've lost control again ♪ And how I'll never know just why or understand ♪ She said, I've lost control again ♪ And she screamed out kicking on her side ♪ And said, I've lost control again ♪ And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die ♪ She said, I've lost control again ♪ She's lost control again ♪ She's lost control ♪ She's lost control again ♪ She's lost control ♪ Well I had to phone her friend to state my case ♪ And say she's lost control again ♪ And she showed up all the errors and mistakes ♪ And said I've lost control again ♪ She expressed herself in many different ways ♪ Until she lost control again ♪ And walked upon the edge of no escape ♪ And laughed, I've lost control again ♪ She's lost control again ♪ She's lost control ♪ She's lost control again ♪ She's lost control. ♪ Wait your bloody wait your bloody lost and bloody found Stuck in bloody Chickentown The bloody pies are bloody old The bloody chips are bloody cold The bloody beer is bloody flat The bloody flats have bloody rats The bloody clocks are bloody wrong The bloody days are bloody long It bloody gets you bloody down Evidently Chickentown. Far from crazy pavements The taste of silver spoons A clinical arrangement On a dirty afternoon The faecal germs of Mr Freud Are rendered obsolete The legal term is null and void In the case of Beasley Street In the cheap seats where murder breeds Somebody runs out of breath Sleep is a luxury they don't need A sneak preview of death Belladonna is your flower Manslaughter your meat Spend a year in a couple of hours On the edge of Beasley Street Where the action isn't That's where it is State your position No vacancies exist An X—certificate exercise Ex-servicemen excrete Smiles and a baby dies In a box on Beasley Street In the kingdom of the blind A one-eyed man is king Beauty problems are redefined The doorbells do not ring A light, full burst, like a blister The only form of heat Where a fellow sells his sister Down a river on Beasley Street In the boarding houses and the bedsits Full of accidents and fleas Somebody gets it Where the missing persons freeze Wearing dead men's overcoats You can't see their feet A riff joint shuts opens up Right down on Beasley Street... As you can see, everything has just vanished. The whole thing has been erased from the face of the earth. I feel great anger. I feel massive sadness It's like I've had a complete loss of childhood because although I've always lived in Manchester and I've always lived relatively close to here, this part of Manchester. Now, when I pass through here, or even being here today, it's just so foreign to me.

Some of these fans have travelled hundreds of miles. They queued for hours for a glimpse of their idol and to buy the book in which he chronicles the first 25 years of his life. He's my idol, really. He's a really good footballer and everyone loves him. I went to see the game last night and he was really good. We've got a ticket for the next one. Hopefully it'll be good. He's gorgeous. He's a brilliant football player. I love him. For someone apparently so ordinary, Beckham excites an extraordinary response from his fans.
