What If You can't expect 1,500 euros in alimony. Plus 500 as compensation. I get dumped like a shit and... Gerard makes 3,200 If you get 2,000 he'll only have 1,200 He left so he has to pay. I see to the home, the kids... He owes me for all that. You gave in... You sound like him! If you had kept studying you'd have a better post. Who'd have brought the kids up? Some minder? I don't care, I don't have any. I work 12 hours a day, I pay my taxes... You've never known childbirth, So spare me your world view! My view is a woman should work. Really work! You give it all. You've got to leave a mark. I'm sick of you whining women I worked my butt off to give us a good life. And now he decides to take off. It's not fair. Gerard's giving you 500 euros. That's not bad. He has 2,700 left. It's more honest. What do I care about being honest? I'm 40, with two kids and no husband. I'm nothing now. There are hundreds like me. What guy needs a depressive? Okay, but why wear Campers? What's wrong with my Campers? You won't hook a guy that way. You have to fight. The Campers mean you've given in. Hi, Juliette. Okay? How are the kids? What do you think of my shoes? Your shoes? I should have an opinion? No, Margot. I want the male view on this. Well I think... Go ahead, I don't mind. You're sure? A girl in those shoes won't be much fun in bed. Cut it out. It's pathetic. You wanted my opinion. Your shoes say you're hot? It's different with men and women. Mr. Loisel! Loisel's having an attack! Call an ambulance! It's locked. Edouard, hold on. Look at me! It's Margot. Remember telling me "It's no free ride?" No history of heart trouble. The stress killed him That's terrible! Clementine, put out the silver. Show her, Margot? So a partner's position is free? We're all on tender-hooks. They'll pick the new partner in-house. We're in the running. We've killed off the competition. It all hangs on the interview now. No, we didn't kill anyone. It's just an expression It means we... How can I put it? For heaven's sake Someone died. This is worse than Dallas. What's Dallas? A dumb TV show. Dallas was brilliant! Dallas, Your ruthless world.... How did it go? Just a second... Yes, that's it! What came next? Hello, everyone! Hi, Dad. For my favorite grandchildren. Mum, I got a light saber! Great! Let me see. I got a Barbie! Oh no, Dad, not a Barbie! Dad... My soufflé! Let's eat! Okay, Dad? Yes, and you? I'm fine The Barbie was a bad idea? Oh, you know her. I don't understand. This position as partner.... How many get picked? Just one. Quick! Look before it collapses! No. it's sinking. It's perfect! You'll be competing with each other? Technically, yes. But we share all our cases. We form a team We'll just have extra prestige and money. But if you split up, what happens? I'm serious. How will you manage? Delicious! You've really outdone yourself. Gerard's a real fool to leave a cook like you. Pierre... You go wild over a Barbie but lap up dad's praise. My soufflé's good. We know Victor isn't with you for you cooking! I totally agree. We can't refuse! It's the fast track to our own firm. But my sister was right. What if we split up? Is this okay? Wouldn't pants be better? You look fine. Here I can't imagine splitting up. You say that now but maybe you'll tire of me one day. You're the woman of my dreams. No one tires of dreams. You'll have to leave me. If i do, I'll have given up men. Come on. Hold on, I don't feel right. We can't be late. Just three minutes! Shit! Where are my pant? You look fine! I can’t mess up our last interview. I’ll get a taxi. Don't complicate things! You do that! Just let me change or go on ahead. My appearance counts. Going together would be more romantic. The skirt's a plus. You can play on seduction, unlike me. Pants would have been wrong. Shit! That's them! Is everything okay? High heels are a moral mistake. What partner dreses like a stewardess? It's a male domination thing? No wonder you giggle at my shoes. Still mad about that? I've made a tower! Good, but I'm talking. Look at his tower! It's brilliant. It's just a pile of wooden blocks. Try them instead of Barbie. Let us talk now. Deep down, it changes nothing they chose Victor. It’s true, I’m glad. If you’d worn Campers… Stop it! I’m sorry I didn’t wear pants. If only I'd taken the time... Bravo! I'm so happy! I was sure they'd pick Victor! Me too! It's incredible. It's progress. I bullshitted them. I said I had three brothers, grew up in a totally male world. and that there'd be no baby at 40 since I was sterile. And Victor? What about him? How's he taking it? He's taking it well. Why wouldn't he? He must be surprised. And since all modern men see women with scissors, you must have garden shears! You’re so negative No. It’s reality. A man needs a woman for food, status, and sex. Anyhow, you'll see what happens. Just keep a low profile and run the house. Antonin, come here! What on earth are you doing? Two new messages. Today at 11:02 AM Hi, it's Jean-Michel I just heard that the firm has a first-class partner at last. You were always the best. Call me. Tonight, champagne on me. Talk to you later. Press 5 to call back. Hiya, Honey What is all this? We’re going out to a great restaurant. Thanks, honey. that’s sweet. but I’ve made vol-au-vents for us. You’ve cooked? Hi, Samual! Okay? We’re really happy. Want to congratulate Margot? She’s on her mobile right now. Can she call you? Okay, great. You too. Take care. What’s wrong? People keep calling. I want to be with you tonight. It’s okay. Call it a mushroom soup with croutons. Good job we stayed in. Stop it. I’m a useless cook. I did it for you. I’m kidding! What’s wrong? Nothing. It’s so good to be here together. So what’s happening? Do you get Loisel’s old office? Do we have to talk work? What’s wrong? Why are you like this? Everything’s fine. I feel so good with you. Let’s go to the bedroom. I’m trying to eat. Sorry, this is weird. You jump on me… What’s wrong with you tonight? Calm down? He wouldn’t make love! I tried everything. The dress, the dinner, the works… It’s because I got picked. Those shears of yours. If that’s how it is, I won’t be a partner. Yes, I’m sorry… If they’d picked Victor, I’d have been happy. We’d have had a great party. We’d have danced all night. We’d have gone wild! Want to clean up in the kitchen? I’ll show you where it is. Use paper towels or sponge it out. Without salt? Salt is used in dyeing to fix colors. No, not like that. People put salt on wine stains. People! You need to absorb the wine, then rinse it before it dries. You should rinse your shirt out now. Why should I take your word for it? I’m 40, on shit pay, with two kids, a cheating husband, pathetic alimony… My self-esteem’s so low, if I claim somthing, I check my sources first. There. Five minutes on high to dry it out. My self-esteem isn’t that great either. One day, she just told me we’d evolved differently I know: “Our expectations differ, there’s no desire.” I got, “Desire doesn’t flow between us.” He was screwing one of his students. How does it feel to get banged by the new Bervesier partner? Say that again…. We’re in the way No. His shirt’s in the oven. It takes all sorts. I spilled wine. Make yourselves at home. Here. You were right. The collar… It’s fine but clause 37 is fishy. It’s too easy on the client. Your conclusions are too harsh. Let them save face. Victor, look! You’re in Les Echos! You’re a star now. Seen this? Profit needs a photo. I don’t have one. I can mail one from my phone. I’ll fax all this to Durand. Thank you, my love. Sorry. Goodbye, everyone. Here? Sorry, but could you keep still? Try to look natural. Smile though. I’m really ugly. Just a bit tense. Your tie’s not right. May I? It’s a bit too limp. Sorry. Forgive me. Come on, smile. It’s a great photo. Love makes you blind. Heard back from Durand? No why? That’s odd. Gentlemen… Ms Dieterman will work the case with me. Would you like coffee? I’d love some. Coffee all around? Eleonore! Seen Eleonore? Looks like she’s vanished. Let’s get started. I’ve studied the file and there are a few problems. I’ve come up with some ideas. Okay! Fine and you? Fine. Here to see Margot? Yes, about my lawyer’s conclusions. She’s in a meeting right now. Want me to take a look? Come to my office. Is this your little girls? Where is your borther? Just a second. What are you doing here? Is Auntie Margot a waitress? Of course not, she’s a lawyer. Delighted to see you. Let me introduce you to Goudal. Henri, meet Victor Bandini our new partner. I saw you studied in Rennes for a while. I love Brittany Come with me. When he starts on Brittany, he moves on to business. I want you to meet someone. You look ravishing. Nadine, meet the wife of Nicolas’ new partner. We’re not married… Same thing nowadays. Nadine is our concert fixer. She knows all the top soloists. Bravo for clause 37. We found a dubious debt. Do you like music? Excuse me. And Martinez? Vibert is refusing to pay liability. We’ll get Tellerman to help. He knows Vibert well. We’re having lunch next week. Ah! Here’s Mercier! You remember I warned you about clause 37? I was going to say so. As long as you know. Dear friends, our concert is about to begin. I don’t have time to check my messages. Durand? He still hasn’t called? That’s odd. Give him a call. I can’t, I’m in court all day. Shit your ex! Margot? What a surprise! Pascale! Congratulations! I heard Victor’s partner now. I should congratulate you. Due in two weeks and I’m working non-stop! I run an employment law firm. We’re rushed off our feet. And you? Well, nothing much. I’m working for Victor… I mean, with him. Keep in touch. Great. Thanks. See you. Okay, girls, let’s go She’s my ex’s girlfriend. She’s not in great shape. I’ll check on it. I’ll call you back. He never got your fax. What? The transmission report is in the file. Pascale has her own firm now. She could never find work before. You sent the fax to Chenal! Oh shit! You faxed the information to the opposing party! It’s not my job! You bask in glory… Clause 37 again?! Help me, I’m under pressure here. So I see. That’s all I see. A big man with responsibilities. Hold on, what is this? It’s easy for you to just walk out. Don’t worry. I’ll call Durand and say it was my fault. You’ve cut your hair? Yeah. Hi, mum. How are you? It suits you. Not at the office? I’m sick of working so much. I need time for myself. Hi, how’s it going? You write really well now! That’s a great drawing! Here is Bertrand and you serving coffee. He thinks you’re a waitress now. By the way, Bertrand is taking over my divorce. That’s good of him. I saw Victor’s ex. She’s pregnant. No, Clementine. Don't use feminine. A vase, masculine, and flower, feminine. But the adjective is masculine. Know why? The masculine is stronger. It always rules. I’m the strongest. You’re a little shit. Are you nuts? Come here, kitten. He’s only six. Come here. It’s not his fault if you serve coffee now. Come here, kitten. You thought you’d never end up like us. Well, tough! If they’d picked me, I wouldn’t have some mad cow yelling at me. I’d be at a business party, and much more at home. You’re very lucky. A bright future awaits him. May I borrow her? All the best to Bandini. It’s an ideal time to meet Mercier. The bow tie by the horse. How did it go with Goudal? Bandini this, Bandini that… You heard him send his best? Ignore that old fart. Don’t move. Dieterman… Useless, I hear. Probably slept to get the job. The guy was brilliant but they picked the woman. He’s her guy too! I get it now. They’re counting on him to provide back-up. Forget them. They’re young farts. I’m all yours, Nicolas. Francois, meet Ms. Dieterman, our new partner. Francois Mercier. So, you work with Bandini? Is he here? I’d love to meet him. He’s at his mother’s but you’ll meet him on the 18th. Concerning your project… I’ll talk to Bandini on the 18th. Let’s enjoy the evening. You liked the music? Yes, very pretty. Pretty? Well, you can’t call Berg pretty. Schoenberg, you mean? Schoenberg, yes. Did I say Berg? Ridiculous. Totally different period. I don’t like the interpretation. They seem to want to explain serialism to us. The harmony is illegible. Schonberg’s modernity is… more subtle. So true. You know, Dieterman, I insisted we chose you rather than Bandini. Unfortunately, you lack something: A sense of legitimacy. Without it, a lawyer sucks. So change cars, read up on music, play golf, try what you like, but get a hold on your sense of legitimacy! On the 18th, keep Bandini away and impose yourself. What? You love him? I’ll see to it then. I’ll send him out of Paris. You can comfort him. Come on, Dieterman. Show me I was right to insist. How was your mother? A drag, as usual. How did it go? You met Mercier? I’ve got him in my pocket. He’ll sign with his eyes closed. I said we were there to relax, not work. I talked music… You hate music. I went on about serialism and Schoenberg. I had him eating out of my hand. Where did you get that? Come here, you little shark. I’m so proud of you. I’m really happy you’re a partner. Want to get married? Are you serious? Now you’re getting rich… I love you, you know. Me too. I’m totally wasted! Bandini, I have a problem. That farm machinery case near Le Mans… I said I’d go but I’m stuck in Paris. I’ll go. When is it? Just a second. Eleonore… When’s that assessment set for? Let me check… The 18th. Thank you The 18th is a problem. We’re seeing Mercier. Really? Things went well at the concert. Dieterman quite impressed him. It should go smoothly. Right? I could send Lavoisier to Le Mans… No. I’d rather you go. If Dieterman screws up with Mercier. It’ll mean we made the wrong choice. Ten already! I hate this situation. Come on, we got what we wanted. We have to stick with now. I love you. Me too. Guys our age… It’s tough but someone has to start to make room for women. It’s a bummer. That’s progress, see. Want to be an asshole and fight it? You can tell your kids you helped women get ahead. Come and see something. We make room but we’ll keep buying them rings. I need you advice. Which one do you suggest? How should I know? Which do you prefer? This one. Not this one? Six months since I touched a woman. I can’t focus on a ring! That’s unhealthy! React! Eleonore, got a minute? Could you give us the woman’s view? Give Eleonore a go. I tried. Straight off, which do you prefer? Don’t think about it! Well, this one’s more classical and this one’s more original. Which one would you like? Why. You’re buying me a ring? Just say so. I’ll take it. Honey! I told you to wake me. I was making breakfast. I’m off to Le Mans! I’ve been thinking. Forget the train. Here. What’s this? Open it! I don’t believe it. We can’t afford it. We can. On credit. You like it? Well? It’s the best gift ever. Really? My ring looks cheap now. I love your ring. I didn’t need a car anyway. Fancy a spin? No. I have to get ready for Mercier. Bye, love. Morning, Ms Dieterman. Good morning, gentlemen. Ms Dieterman. We met at the Schoenberg concert. Yes, sorry. I wasn’t in great shape. Eleonore… Coffee, please. Let’s start. We have a lot to get through. Yes, Isn’t Mr Bandini here? No, he’s away today. Yes, Near Le Mans. Mr. Mercier? Allow me to be frank. You can’t risk making an acquisition like this. There are gaps in the accounts, a hazy tax status and three current court cases whose outcome is far from certain. Turn to page seven, please. Thank you, Eleonore. I knew you were made for this. You’re back? How did the evening go? Okay. The wedding invitations are great. I had 50 of them done. Let’s invite Bertrand. Maybe he’ll hit if off with your sister. Him and Juliette? Maybe. Blue looks good. How’ll we have kids if you’re always out? Who mentioned having kids? I’ll work less, to look after them. I’d tell you about their day after work. I told the firm I was sterile. We’ll say it’s a miracle It’s too early. Wait until I settle in. How long will it take to settle in? Five years? Try to understand. In my shoes, you’d want kids too. Imagine if I wanted to wait. You can’t compare. I can. You’d be mad and I’d be a career-obsessed jerk. Mr. Bandini? Wife on telephone. I’ll call her back. He’s in a meeting. Even if he’s with the Pope, put him on. I’ll hold. What’s going on? I told you two weeks ago. You even noted it in your diary. I cancelled a meeting. We have to screw. No, I have to be in court after. The doctor told us to be precise. You want a kid or not? I’ll be waiting. You’re trying to bring the insolvency date forward. Right here. Can you wait for me? I won’t be long. If you establish insolvency prior to March 31st, You can cancel the loan. Yes, I know the law too. Sue the banks for poor counsel? He must be dreaming. Talk him out of it. I have a meeting. I’ll call you back. Goodbye. Ready? Very stimulating. Don’t play up now. I’m a woman. I need time. I like to talk… What a drag. You used to be more down-to-earth. You used to be more inventive. No, always cut fennel lengthwise. As if it matters. You follow the fibers. What do you mean? It’s okay. I can do it. It just tastes better cut that way You’re a real pain. So how do I cut zucchinis? Tell me. If I do cubes, you’ll say you want slices. Do what you like. Slices? You said you’d do cubes. And? I’m baking them. You’re nuts, you know. That’s why Gerard left you. You need to change to keep Bertrand. This must be Victor. I need help with Gemora. The appeal deadline is tomorrow. You have to come here. No way. This was planned weeks ago! I have a ton of work to do. We have to meet Bertrand. We’ve known him 5 years. No, not like this. Thank you. How are you? Sorry. Are you okay? Yes, I’m okay. I don’t care. I’m not paid enough to work all night! Go to hell! The Gemora file, how often do I… Here it is. But you dinner just arrived and I’m only human. You’re welcome. I’ll copy the contracts now. And so the Chinaman gets out and says, “Hey, that’s my car!” I screwed up the punch-line Fennel’s great like this. Juliette’s cooking always is. No one else dares to cook and she has to do it all. Following your letter of… Check date. I can now inform you that my client is read to… I’m off. Good luck. Try to get a little sleep. Remember what happened to Loisel. Good night. Mr Matoub on 4. Put him on. Eleonore, you can go home now. It’s an emergency. When I’m sock of it,I’ll get a 9 to 5 job. Your call. Mr. Matoub, how are you? She’s so aggressive. She’s not in her usual state. She isn’t pregnant like she thought. What are you doing? Let me do it. You need a much finer blade than this. The way you carve a bird matters. If you cut the joints instead of dislocating them, you get cartilage everywhere and… Sorry. I’m a bit obsessive. I love it. Go on. Eleonore. I can’t find what’s his name’s fax. Is it in the meeting room? I’ll check. It’s okay. I’ve found it! It’s me. You must be hard at it. I’m sorry for earlier It was hell, they talked about cutting fish and meat all evening. I’ll tell you about it. I’m very happy with you even if we argue a lot lately. I really like you. I really like you too. But you can’t leave your wife because she’s too fragile. But it isn’t this hot with her. So you’re wondering if sex and love have anything in common. I thought, “Shit, I’ll have him like the others.” That’s why I’d have preferred Margot. Just to see… True. Margo wouldn’t bang her secretary! Come and meet Emmanuelle who’s replacing Eleonore. Try to be friendly and welcoming. I love her name already. She’ll need a big wicker chair. You’d fly with her, huh? Meet Emmanuel Garrand. Dieterman, we’re late. Emmanuel, that fax? I sent it, Nicolas. Ready? Delighted. It’s always been Eleonore and Mr Bandini. Very polite and formal. Same here. “That file, Eleonore.” ”Yes, Mr Lavoisier.” Exactly! I mean, secretary is a woman’s job. Women are kind and caring. They bring you coffee. A guy’s a competitor. It’s all first names and who’s got the bigger dick. You’re awful. I know. But it feels good. I’ll get Margot for this. With you new secretary, It’s absurd for us to keep using Mercier and Dieterman. I’ll ask him to stop. No. You can’t turn back the clock. From now on, it’ll be Margot and Nicolas. I have to get my wife a birthday present. Could you help me? I’d love to…Nicolas. You were right to bring madam to try them. The ring, please. There. Perfect. It’s a unique piece, like each of our models. The necklace… It suits her beautifully. Not bad… I’m sure she’ll like it. Excellent. Is she looking at me? The car does that. Go for it! No Go on. Hello. It’s his car. It is. I’m loaning it to him. He’s worth knowing. I have to see you again. Really? Call me. Fantastic. Better than Meetic. You use Meetic? I’ve never tried it myself. Good morning. Morning, Emmanuel. Margot, a runner brought this. Bandini! In shape? Can you help me correct some contracts? Let’s go. Margot, join us after you check your mail. Shit… What’ll you do? Nothing about his note or his attitude signals… If he gave you this, he wants to shag you. You don’t know him. He’s very classy. He’s helped me a lot. He’s married as well. You should give it back. Say you can’t accept it, because of Victor. I mean, what’ll you tell Victor? You’re right. It is magnificent, though. I said I’ll give it back. Good evening. Nicolas… I can’t accept. Rubbish. We’re hunting big game tonight. And it suits you beautifully. Who’s this? What are you doing? Having a drink.Bertrand, a colleague. Juliette, my sister-in-law. I’ve heard a lot about you. Yeah? I’m with someone. Seen a short, very dark man? Hiya, boys! It’s them. Great place, isn’t it? Meet Solange. My sister-in-law, Julette. I’ll get drinks. What would you like. I have to be going. Have fun. Don’t go. It’s okay. I don’t need this shit. It was Bertrand who… That creep looks sexually frustrated! I don’t get it. You’re with a woman who truly loves you but… Just a second. Spare me the talk.You’ve no idea what it’s like. I sit at home while she turns clients on at parties. where I’d be in the way. I’d spoil her Amazon act. Margot’s ashamed of me. and that’s wrong. I’m allowed a drink with my sexually frustrated pal. and some fun girls. To prove you can’t stand being inferior? Didn’t you hear me? She’s the one who can’t stand it! You think it’d be better if you had her job. I can’t help it if society works this way, In my shoes, Margot would have had kids. and I’d be at the parties. And bang your secretary, you jerk. It’s impossible to talk to you. Are you free, Eleonore? I need my wedding invitations. Too bad. You’ll have to come and get them. People won’t understand. Just say lace or cotton. I can’t, Bertrand… Look at this. I’m wearing it just for you. Cut it out… Juliette? I think Victor’s sleeping with his secretary. No! You saw him? She flashed her suspenders and he grabbed her ass. His secretary? What a crap cliche. What do I tell Margot? You don’t know? You land this on me and… I have to go. What do you think? I don’t know. It’s a bit weird. It really looks like a wedding dress. Well, it’s for a wedding. You shouldn’t ask me to help pick a wedding dress. Marriage allows a man to annex a woman’s body to control her urges. Read Francoise Heritier. She was a housewife for 15 years, got dumped and found feminism. How does Bertrand put up with you? Careful he doesn’t run off with his secretary. You look so beautiful! A spring flower. Am I a flower too? Yes, you’re a flower too. It’s only a rehearsal anyway. The father escorts the bride. So what? We’re not even in church. Let’s go, children. We’re behind the music! Stop the music. Let’s try it again. One more time, children. You shoelace is undone. The music’s late. Don’t look, she’s here. Who? Hello, Eleonore. Let’s kiss today. Congratulations. Thank you. Okay, honey? Fine. Wonderful. Wonderful you could make it. I’m nude under my mac. Stop, I’ll get hard! My sister’s kissing Victor’s mistress on her wedding day! Relax. Calm down. My belly hurts… What’s wrong? Come and sit down. It’s an instant ulcer. Oh, shit! What a crazy world. I was so relieved when they picked Victor. I’m so ashamed now. I was jealous of her. It’s dumb. What did I care if she got the job? Don’t say that. No one can tell. No use crying over spilled milk. Only idiots have no regrets. If she’d been picked, she’d be rich and free. You don’t know that. Maybe she’d have been overworked. Maybe we’d never have met. Margot Dieterman… That’s the office. Emmanuel, can you ask Victor to take my meeting tonight? I’ll be held up here for a while. A long while. No, I have a meeting for the SMEP brochure. Call an assistant, say you’re held up with a very old client. Maybe Margot took it. Is this it? Hold on… We can’t send the rough version! Josephine, go and check the Xerox room. The runner’s waiting. Margot, the SMEP accounts. Call me. On her desk! I woke you? No I got to bed at 4. Don’t worry, another dud. So all men are jerks? No, it was a woman this time. She was sick of bitter straights turning lesbian on the rebound. I wasn’t her type either. How can I sink any lower? My period’s two weeks late. Don’t get in such a state. Margot. Come on… Work’s going well, you’ll get organized. I can look after it. It’s not that. What then? I don’t know who the father is. You kept the necklace! You didn’t use a condom? I tried to. I insisted, believe me. But everything became so complicated. What an idiot! People tour Africa teaching women to use condoms. and you with all your diplomas… Can we do without ideology? The world wants to do without it! You pain! I’m going crazy here! We lost the SMEP. You’re kidding? I don’t believe it. What’s up? We lost the SMEP. Josephine! Bring all the SMEP files. Where is she? Margot? Are you in there? We didn’t get approval for the SMEP. What? Hurry! Just a second. Some faulty subsidiary in Brazil… The SIP. I mentioned it. It’s one big mess. You kept cancelling meetings. What do we do? I told Martinez we’d float on the 10th. What are you doing? Face this. I can’t! Please… It’s impossible Margot screwed up. Ms Dieterman just left. What’s up with the SMEP? It’s my fault. She mentioned the SIP but I forgot. Overwork. You’re mad. You realize the damage? Margot wouldn’t make such a mistake. You need to call Martinez. I’ll tell you when to come out. Victor Don’t thank me. I did it for our child. I’m so happy! I dreamt of this. It’ll all be okay now. We’re going to be happy. Smile! I’m so happy! That’s a good one. Let’s have a kiss. I’m so happy! I thought you’d never have one! To my third grandchild! Sorry, excuse me! Don’t answer. While Margot works, I can chat up mothers at the creche. Here, dear. Cheers. Cheers. You’re not drinking? This is total madness! What can I do? I have to keep it. Victor will leave me otherwise. What about Bervesier? You’ll ask him to be godfather? I don’t know… I’ll split up and tell him… It’s Bervesier. Yes, just a second. What’s it like to be an auntie? It’s great. I can’t tonight. I can’t make up yet another meeting. This is getting complicated. I agree. We can’t go on like this. It doesn’t make sense. Margot, I am leaving my wife. I can’t be without you. I miss you. As a boy, when imagined my dream woman, it was you I saw. I can’t let you get away now. but I’m married too! I can fire your husband. He really screwed up on the SMEP brochure. See you at Place des Vosges. I’ll text you the room number. See you there. I want that one. I have another one. Me in the maternity home. She’s so cute. She’d like a copy. There are others. I’ve never seen them. Stop seeing him. It’s harassment! He can’t fire Victor. Get a lawyer. No, have to find a way. I’ll pretend to leave Victor. If Bervesier sets up a firm for me. I tell Victor I could get fired for being pregnant. So I need a firm of my own. That’s ridiculous, Margot. You can’t keep lying.Talk to Victor. And tell him he’s fired because I slept with the boss? Is that him? What a pig. I’ll set him straight. Shit, Juliette, you’re not helping me! It’s okay, he’s gone. No, don’t give me that look. It was do dumb of me. What was I thinking? You thought he’d guide you. Women can’t be groomed to take over without some cheap Pygmalion act. Would Victor have had this much trouble? No, he’d be like a son to Bervesier. They’d stroll along. discussing the world’s complexities. You remind me of myself at your age. I hope I’ll be like you. I was lucky. It was easier back then. I set up my own firm because I was asked… To drop a client. You told me. I’m rambling. How tragic! I probably invoked ethical reasons. but the truth is I hated to lose.Just like you. Sometimes, you have to accept it. Martinez? We haven’t lost in court yet. Goudal’s on the Vibert board. So we back off. Martinez won’t agree. He’s a crook. He won’t want the IRS brought in. I’m his lawyer! I can’t… I insisted we picked you rather than your wife. Come on, Bandini, show me I as right to insist. I admired that guy. How could I be so wrong? He acts like he’s scared you’ll quit. He’s right to be. It makes me sick. All because Martinez isn’t in their clique. I’ll resign Your wife won’t agree. It’s my life, okay. We’re free, Eleonore. I’ve been too weak. It’s time to react. I have a life to live. I admire you. I don’t even dare ask for a raise. Look who It’s Daddy. What’s that? I’d forgotten how much I like it. I saw an apartment earlier. We have to make an offer. It’s ideal. We need to talk. No way! You can’t resign! I’m sick of the job now. We’re having another baby. Act responsible. I have a life. All the sacrifices I made… It’s true! I was a brilliant student at university! Enough of this! The sacrifice was your decision! You wanted to raise the baby! What would we have done?Hired child-minders? You want kids raised by minders? You always dodge the real issue. Okay. Okay. Victor, where are you going? I don’t want to live with you. I love you. There’s more to this than just sex. There is. Because I always agree, flatter you and blow you? That’s not love. You’re only here because your wife doesn’t agree. I pretended to believe you’d resign to make you happy. You did? Try to be realistic. What’ll you tell your kids? ”Meet Eleonore, “my mistress since before you were born?” You’re horrendous. I love you. I know I’ve screwed up. I don’t understand what I did. You need to know. Forget it. I should have stepped aside and let you be partner. You’d have been the best. Who cares? I care. Thank you. I’d like to thank “Career Woman” for this award. It’s a very great honor. To young women starting out, I’ll say, “Go for it.” The world is waiting for us all. Everyone was so kind. No one has ever done me down for being a woman. I think the obstacles in a woman’s way are above all inner ones. I’d like to dedicate this award to Mr. Bervesier who gave me the confidence I lacked. As I branch out on my own. I remember what I owe him. Thank you. Inner obstacles? Brilliant. Has she forgotten how I supported her? What a smooth talker! As for resigning because she’s pregnant… Mr. Bandini? Hello, my name’s Estelle. I write for my law school magazine. Could I interview you? Certainly, I’ll tell you all about inner obstacles. Appearances can be misleading. Ms Dieterman’s speech earlier. didn’t really reflect the truth. How can I put it? Shit, my shirt! Very clever… It was an accident! Do you have any salt? Salt is used to set colors. I don’t need you. I can manage alone. Asshole. May I? Go ahead. Is Ms Dieterman leaving because she’s pregnant? Did you oblige her to give up motherhood to become a partner? Do you think society is ready to accept women. but not women with children? Maybe my question isn’t clear? May I borrow her for a second. You’re pregnant? I think Bervesier knows. Yes, I told the reporter all about their misogynist policy. Why? You’re crazy! It’s not that serious. I’m in pain. A glass of water, please. Don’t get in such a state. Margot loves you. You and no one else. She’s sleeping with Berversier! But you told me she got picked for equality. I told yout that? And that her guy was briliant. Well, he’s lost everything. We’re talking business. Real business or how to fuck her? What’s to say this kid’s mine? Don’t be vulgar. We’ll do a test. I won’t chicken out. Big mistake. You’re finished. I’ll crush you. I’ll wait in the car. I’m going to puke. Victor, please forgive me. It’s all my fault. I replaced your pills with sweeteners. What? How could you do that? You’re a psychopath! Forgive me, I couldn’t stand you getting it. and I couldn’t stand having it. My love. We should have fled. Left to travel the world, build a boat with a big white sail. and just drift along. I love you so much. We could have been so happy. Honey, it’s too late. Let’s start over again. Pretend we never went to the interview. Remember that morning? We woke up late. We arrived after them. That’s them! We started running to catch up with them. We weren’t fast enough. We ran up the stairs. Suddenly, for some reason, we slowed down. You took my hand. Let’s get out of here. I followed you without doubt. What happens now?
