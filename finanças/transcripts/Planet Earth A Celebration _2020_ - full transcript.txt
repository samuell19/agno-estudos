We are living in extraordinary times. The pandemic has changed all our lives. But while WE are restricted... ..wildlife is free. SWEEPING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS In moments of crisis, the natural world can be a source of both inspiration and escape. So we are taking you on an adventure... ..to some of the wildest places on Earth... ..bringing together spectacular stories from Planet Earth II... ..and Blue Planet II. And accompanying this special journey, there's a new score created by Hans Zimmer and Jacob Shea, who composed the music for the original series... ..performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra, and featuring, on piano, the award-winning artist Dave. Working remotely on opposite sides of the Atlantic, they've come together to create a visual and a musical feast. Our adventure will take us to some of the most extreme environments on Earth. From the hottest deserts... ..to the freezing poles... ..and from highest mountains... ..to mysterious kingdoms under water... ..where, against all odds, life flourishes... ..giving us all a message of hope for the future. This is... PIANO TINKLES SOFTLY STRINGS TRILL WAVES CRASH The Atlantic. Off the coast of South Africa, it collides with the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. Spectacular winter storms create colossal waves. But one species turns these turbulent seas into a playground. Bottlenose dolphins. They are extremely intelligent... ..and with this intelligence comes playfulness. JOYOUS, ROUSING MUSIC PLAYS They surf... ..and as far as we can tell, they do so for the sheer joy of it. MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC FADES The coastal waters of South Africa teem with life. And below the surface... ..one of the greatest of all kelp forests... ..which is home to some truly extraordinary creatures... ..including one smart individual who's found rather ingenious ways to survive. Barely visible except for the pulsating siphon through which it breathes, a common octopus waiting for prey to pass by. A crab will do. The octopus sets off in pursuit. OMINOUS STRINGS PLAY INTENSE BEAT MUSIC QUICKENS And then, lurks... ..with the patience of an ambush hunter. MUSIC FADES MUSIC MIMICS STRIKES But the octopus shares the Cape waters with a great concentration of other predators. UNNERVING, SINISTER MUSIC PLAYS Fur seals... ..and sharks. They all eat octopus... ..if they can find one. And pyjama sharks are experts... ..at hunting in the undergrowth. Time to disappear. But these tough-skinned little sharks are small enough to reach deep into crevices. FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC BUILDS DISCORDANT CLIMAX MUSIC FADES But the octopus is far from finished. She slips her tentacles in to the shark's gills. That prevents the shark from breathing. When caught out in the open, and vulnerable, this octopus does something truly extraordinary... ..and never recorded before. She disguises herself... ..with a protective armour of shells. The shark can sense its prey. But the shells confuse it. SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYS In a forest full of hungry mouths, superior wits allow this octopus to stay alive. Surviving in this submarine jungle can be a challenge. But above the waves, over 700 miles to the north... ..lies a world with challenges of a different kind. The Namib Desert. It's the oldest desert on the planet... ..believed to have been dry since dinosaurs walked the Earth. Life here for a hunter is as hard as it gets. A pride of lions. One of the very few that endures this desert's scorching temperatures and lack of water. A herd of oryx. The only prey within 20 miles. Out here, there is no cover for an ambush. It will have to be a straight chase. INTENSE DRUMBEAT DRUMS FADE They have failed. And each failed hunt brings the lions closer to starvation. To find enough to eat, the pride continually searches an area the size of Switzerland. Three days and 100 miles later, and still no kill. These are desperate times. A dry riverbed on the edge of their territory. The only animals here are giraffe, but these one-tonne giants could kill a lion with a single kick. Lions seldom tackle such formidable prey... ..but this pride can't go on much longer without food. TENSE MUSIC BUILDS The whole pride must work together as a team if they're to succeed. Two lionesses lead the chase, others race to cut off possible escape routes. The giraffe has the speed and stamina to outrun the pride... ..but it's being chased into a trap. Up ahead, the lead female waits. It's now up to her. DRAMATIC MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC STOPS HOOVES THUD LION GROANS Most lion hunts end in failure... ..but no lions fail more often than those that live in the desert. And yet, for generations, despite overwhelming adversity, they have managed to endure. Dawn breaks in the Andes. Here, high altitudes bring their own set of trials. Wildlife faces scorching days and perishing nights. Mountain viscacha are up early to claim the best places to catch the sun's first rays. PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYS For others up here, the sunrise is even more welcome. At over 4,000 metres, this is the highest flamingo colony in the world. At night, it gets so cold that even this salty water freezes over... ..and now the flamingos are trapped in the ice. Eventually, the sun thins the ice, but it's still a struggle for the flamingos to break free. COMICAL, CHEERY MUSIC PLAYS Walking on thin ice is always risky. And it's hard to retain one's dignity... ..especially when you're wearing stilts. At these altitudes, the sun's power can quickly turn from salvation... ..to threat. The atmosphere is so thin, there is very little protection from ultraviolet radiation. By mid-morning, it's risky to linger out in the open. Out on the lake, there is nowhere to hide. The white crust of the soda lake reflects the sun's glare and increases the impact of its ultraviolet rays. By midday, uncovered human skin will burn in four minutes. But this doesn't seem to bother the flamingos... ..in fact, they are on parade. COMICAL MARCHING MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC QUICKENS During the breeding season, the flamingos perform these peculiar courtship dances, even through the hottest time of the day. They're so eager, they don't even pause to feed. The rules are something of a mystery. But after a month of dancing, all the birds will have paired off and will be getting ready to mate. MUSIC STOPS Up here, there are few other creatures to bother the flamingos, but then few other creatures could even tolerate these conditions. Wildlife has colonised almost every corner of our planet... ..even the slopes of its highest mountains. AWE-INSPIRING MUSIC PLAYS The Himalayas. Lethally cold... ..scarred by gales and blizzards... ..these mountains are among the most hostile places on Earth... ..yet a few special animals manage to live here. The snow leopard. Seldom seen, the detail of their lives has long been a mystery. But now, at last, helped by the latest remote camera technology, we are getting closer to them than ever before. They're very rare, only about four of them in 40 square miles. There is simply not enough prey to sustain more. LEOPARD SNIFFS They live solitary lives. Nonetheless, they are well aware of the presence and the movements of their neighbours, because they leave messages in a few special places. They rub particular rocks with their cheeks... ..and then spray them with urine. The two perfumes create a unique signature. Any other leopard can know which of its neighbours passed this way without ever making direct contact. But there are times when snow leopards must come together, and the event is often violent. LEOPARD YOWLS An adult female and her daughter. She has devoted the last two years to raising her cub and very soon it will be weaned. For now, the cub is still entirely dependent on its mother. But staying together as long as this could cause problems. The female is now in heat again, and any male that smells her signature will know that. LEOPARD SPRAYS From this moment on, her cub's life is at risk. Males kill cubs that are not their own. But the mother is now driven by an urge that she cannot control. She lets the males know exactly where she is. LEOPARD CALLS ECHO From up here, she can be heard for miles around. LEOPARD CALLS A young male emerges from the wilderness, eager to find her. Snow leopards meet so infrequently that there is uncertainty and tension. LEOPARDS SNARL AND HISS LOW GROWLING And it's about to get worse... ..another bigger male has arrived. GROWLING HISSING The mother and cub are trapped between the rivals. The cub is now in danger. Mother must act fast. To divert the males' attention from her cub, she rolls over submissively. DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC BUILDS With the males fixed on the female, the cub has a chance to escape. LEOPARD SNARLS The males close in on the mother from both sides, keen to claim her for their own. A fight is inevitable. LEOPARDS ROAR The female moves to escape and protect her cub, but the big male follows her. SNARLING AND ROARING He will not let her leave until he has mated with her. GENTLE STRINGS PLAY With the males gone, the female is, at last, reunited with her cub... ..but she has been injured. The cub, however, is alive thanks to its mother. Until her injury heals, she won't be able to hunt. Mountain animals survive on the very edge of existence. Mother and cub were not seen again. MUSIC BECOMES MELANCHOLIC Until over a month later, high on a ridge, a remote camera was triggered. The female cat. She's no longer limping, but she's now alone. Then an hour after the female has left, the camera is triggered again. ROUSING, VICTORIOUS MUSIC PLAYS LEOPARD SNIFFS It's her cub. Taking her first steps towards adulthood and independence. She is unlikely to see her mother again... ..but every now and then, they will be reunited through the messages they leave on the marking rocks. Her mother has succeeded in raising her, but life ahead will be challenging, and she will spend nearly all of it alone. Existence in these unforgiving mountains is fraught with difficulty... ..but surviving on remote islands can also be tough. The Galapagos lie in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles from the coast of South America. This is Fernandina Island - volcanic, harsh and desolate. To survive here, wildlife has had to evolve specific skills... ..and that has made the iguanas here different from all their relatives. These are marine iguanas. They are vegetarians, but since there's little food for them on the land, marine iguanas graze on the sea floor. A big male like this one can dive to 30 metres and hold his breath for half an hour. There are more than 7,000 individuals on Fernandina alone. And by bringing nutrients from the sea to the land, the iguanas help other animals to survive here too. Crabs feed on dead skin on the iguanas' back, and in turn provide a welcome exfoliation service. FLY BUZZES While smaller lizards prey on the flies that pester the colony. But not all the relationships on this island are so harmonious. Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand. In June, when the hatchlings emerge, they're vulnerable. They must join the adults at the edge of the sea... ..but the journey will be a dangerous one. Racer snakes. TENSE MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC CALMS The snakes miss their chance... MOROSE MUSIC PLAYS ..but more babies are hatching... ..and now the snakes are on the alert. This is the best feeding opportunity they will get all year. MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC STOPS FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS On flat ground, a baby iguana can outrun a racer snake... ..but others are waiting in ambush. MUSIC SLOWS AND QUIETENS Another hatchling has its first glimpse of a dangerous world. DISCORDANT CLATTER TENSE MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC STOPS MOURNFUL MUSIC PLAYS A snake's eyes aren't very good, but they can detect movement. So if the hatchling keeps its nerve, it may just avoid detection. MUSIC BUILDS DISCORDANT MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC FADES FRANTIC CHASE MUSIC PLAYS STRINGS INTENSIFY FRANTIC MUSIC RESUMES A near-miraculous escape. The lucky survivors can begin learning the unique way of life here. Other islands may seem more welcoming places to grow up... ..but appearances can be deceiving. BIRDS CALL During the dry season, over half a million terns crowd onto this remote atoll in the Indian Ocean. Their chicks are still in their dark juvenile plumage. COMICAL, CHEERY MUSIC PLAYS They vary in age. Whilst the more advanced chicks take to the air... SOFT, INSPIRING MUSIC PLAYS ..others aren't quite ready yet. Those just starting to learn to fly use the shallow lagoon that occupies the centre of the atoll as their training ground. It's difficult for some of them to stay aloft for long. DISCORDANT MUSIC PLAYS Giant trevallies. QUIET, EERIE MUSIC PLAYS Usually, they are solitary hunters, but about 50 of them have come here from neighbouring reefs, attracted by this abundance of potential prey. The fledglings stay out of the water if they can. They even drink on the wing. If the trevally are to catch one now... ..they have to up their game. So there is a fish here that, amazingly, has a brain capable of calculating the airspeed, altitude and trajectory of a bird. The time comes when every fledgling has to take to the air and collect food for itself. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC BUILDS Their parents lead them to the training grounds. INSPIRING, SWEEPING MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC FADES TERN SQUAWKS TERN CALLS MUSIC BUILDS EERIE, ETHEREAL MUSIC PLAYS If they are to survive... ..they must learn quickly. After a month of practising over the lagoon, the youngsters start to leave and take their chances out over the open sea. 6,000 miles to the north, and the warm waters of the tropics become a distant memory. The Arctic. For millennia, animals have survived in a world where temperatures can fall to below 50 degrees. And every winter, the Norwegian fjords in the Arctic Circle are crowded by one of the most spectacular assemblies of fish to be seen anywhere. Herrings. Billions of them. And following them... ..orca. There are up to a thousand of them. It's possibly the greatest gathering of orca on the planet. ORCA SQUEAK The herring may be plentiful, but in these winding fjords, they're not always easy to track down. These particular orca, however, are fish-hunting specialists. They work as a team, coordinating their approach by calling loudly to one another. ORCA SQUEAK They herd the herring into tighter and tighter shoals. They swim below them, trapping them against the surface of the sea. And now the orca deploy their special weapon. They beat their tails with such force that the shock waves stun the herring. And then the senseless victims are easily collected. But all this underwater noise attracts others. WHALE GROANS Humpback whales. They move in on the action. They approach the shoal from beneath, and then lunge upwards... ..gathering up to 100 kilos of herring in a single mouthful. The humpbacks are comparative newcomers. They only started coming here within the last decade. But these polar seas are so rich that there appears to be enough food for everyone. We share our planet with spectacular wild animals... ..which have adapted to live in the strangest and harshest of environments. Now, more than ever, they are an inspiration for us all. For this special Planet Earth musical celebration, to raise our spirits during the pandemic, we brought together composer Hans Zimmer and top-selling artist Dave. ..quarantine, whatever happens, you know, that's the composer's life. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't have seen the world ever stopping, ever, if it wasn't for something like this, you know... They're both passionate about the natural world. Anything I write, in one way or the other, is determined, in one way or the other, by nature. You know, that episode everybody's always talking about was the iguanas and the snakes. Every director I've ever worked with only wished that they could have had a car chase like that, or an action scene like that. We're trying to provide you with an experience. COMICAL MARCHING MUSIC PLAYS An experience which gets under your skin, and you start to understand a little bit more what this world is all about and how we fit into this world. To be performing with an orchestra as talented as the one that I did today - amazing. I get a lot of inspiration from the natural world for my music. ELEPHANTS RUMBLE Music is everywhere. There's a tone to the birds when they sing. BIRDS CALL The air, the wind, the trees. The elements. The soundtrack to nature... ..is a beautiful thing. Music and images can create an experience that can teach us something on a profound level. Make us feel... ..a hope. Let's look forward, let's look towards the future. Let's make a better future. Never before in the history of humankind... ..has it been more critical to protect and nurture the natural world... ..which is, after all, our home too. ROUSING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYS
