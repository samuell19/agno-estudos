Stop. Wait. Let me put it under this. Do you remember the scar on the forehead of Tassos? My father. One day he was walking one of his dogs. It saw a bitch across the road and went crazy to get to her. Nothing could stop it. Not even Dad. But Tassos would not let it go. He was scared that it would cross the road and get hit by a car. But the animal was stronger anyhow. It dragged Dad down? ?onto the road. He hit his head on a rock. He was lucky that no cars were passing by just then. His face was badly damaged. If you'd seen him, you wouldn't have recognized him. He looked like a monster, like... I don't know. None of us wanted to look at him. Even the cats were scared. He looked like Rocky Balboa. Go away. The water. Tassos! Can we pass by my parents? I need to get some clothes. No! Your name. Surname. Your phone number. The back is full up again. -The car makes a strange noise. -Why? I don't know. You take it. Our girl came by. She left a bag of aloe for you in the kitchen. Tell him the freezers are full. What the fuck is he doing? Here. Thank you. I hope you didn?t make him pick up roadkill. It?s forbidden. I?ll throw both of you out. There are rules here. Take one. What's going on with the two of you? We have many more animals than just those coming from owners. We'll cremate all the extras tomorrow night, when no one is here. I'm going up. Don?t forget to lock up. Come. Well done, you asshole. Get in position. Shoot. Come, I'm switching it on. Come on! The day after tomorrow. See you. A fly trapped in a car. Is it lost when it escapes? Perhaps miles away from where it started? Have you ever thought of this? I don't know. Can they adapt to this kind of forced migration? Do they have a sense of... ...loss or nostalgia? Do they want to return home? Your pet will be cremated individually. The ashes will be returned to you within 24 hours. With the certificate to go with them. Surname. Phone number. -The name. -Of the...? Yes. Date of birth. Leave it! Eat something. Wait... Pull yourself together. Go away. Oguz! Tomorrow at eight. Okay? What is it? They want you next door. -Why? -An animal. Go and get it. -What kind of animal? -A dog. Is it yours? Never mind. How did it happen? Don't worry about it. I will sort this out with your boss, don?t worry. They didn't pay. He says they will sort it out with our guy. It's from hunting pellets, isn't it? Yes. Get in the car. Come on. I will leave. Get in the car. For fuck's sake. Go look around the back. A little bit more here. -Don't put in more. -It's only a little. There won't be enough left for the other one. This is for two people. They may want to share it. What did you do? What was that? I don't know. Stop. Where are you going? What did you hit? I don't know. Oguz, hurry up, let's go. Oguz! Let me introduce you to the boys. He is one of us. Here is the boss. Let's have a toast to the boss, our neighbour. N e a n i k o P l a n o Subtitles
