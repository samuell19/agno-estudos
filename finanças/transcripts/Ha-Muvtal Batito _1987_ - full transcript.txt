DVD / DVDRip Duration: 1:25:00 FPS: 25 A Zeev Revach film. "Batito the Unemployed" I want all the workers to disperse and clear away from the gates. "Bread and work with a little garlic and jam..." I want all the workers to disperse. "I am Batito, a veteran worker with a paycheck of 700 shekels. "They arrested me, and opened a file on me. "And threw me to the dogs. "The lady's screaming at the clerk about the high prices. "Now I ask you, what can we do?" "Bread and work with a little garlic and jam..." I repeat myself for the third time, Disperse now and clear the gates. "There's a woman on my block with a body of a panther," "She works night and day in our neighborhood." I require a water cannon be sent to the site to disperse the protesters. Over! All the water cannons are in use at other protests. Make do without. "Bread and work with a little garlic and jam." "Bread and work to increase the birthrate." Did you see? They closed down the factory? That's life. Take it from me, life is nothing but a bunch of shit. Look at us. We work like mules and we can't even wear these uniforms with respect. I can't afford to feed my children. And what about me? You call this a salary? Vaknin, Vaknin. Vaknin get back in line! There's a water hose from the fire-fighters and we could turn on the water at maximum force and disperse them. Good idea, Sergeant Meir. "I laid beside her." "There's no work, nor income so go and strike." I'm asking you as politely as I can, let's be civil about it, and come to terms as nicely as we can. I'm asking you to go home. Really, I'm asking nicely! Let's finish this in a civil manner. Break up the demonstration and go home... Great, great! I'm asking... Captain, the car is at your service. He got hit in the head. All day in front of the TV? Don't you have anything better to do besides just watching TV all day long? No, father, no. It's the middle of the movie. Get back there and start studying! You have finals! Instead you watch movies and if there aren't any movies, you're always listening - to Michael Jackson. - Calm down, relax. - Relax... Shai, my dear boy, Shai! Shai, honey, Shai! Why are you irritated? - Do you know what I'm going through? Do you know what happened to me today? Mirav. - I don't want to hear from her. No, it's not Mirav, it's little Nisim. He needs money for the trip tomorrow. Nisim? - Only 40 shekels. Where I'm gonna get him 40 shekels? What can we do? The whole class is going. - Tell him to be sick. - But he's healthy. Don't interfere! Let him be sick. Batito, come here! Come have a seat. Come sit down and have a little something to drink. Hello! Cheers! Cheers to the blessed memory of my wife. - Cheers! - Cheers! Are you listening? When my wife was alive, we had a black and white TV. When she passed away, this store opened and what did I do? I went and bought this thing, a remote control. Can you see the beam of light? That red eye. It's a good eye, good eye. It makes an evil eye on all the TV sets. Just like this... turns on everyone of them. Look, boom... it's... Drink, drink. No problems, huh? Cheers! Look. And when I finish all the TV shows I'll go to the port. I'll go to the port, and catch a fish or two. Afterwards I'll go to sleep for a two, three, four hours, and after that I'll go to work. Drink, drink. Where do you get all those thoughts you have in your head? - What's wrong? - What can I tell you, Zaki, when you have work you're happy. But since I haven't been working I haven't been sleeping. - I'm going crazy. - No, you don't need to go crazy. Life is lovely. Look at me. Do you see? I work in a conference room of different parties. Everyone comes here and everyone says the same thing. And I host them the same way. Drink, drink, what do I care, let them talk. Let them talk about whatever they want. What about changing to the other channel? But you turned it off. I guess there was a short circuit. - Not a short, it's... You... don't know. It must be the remote. Push here. - On this? The third one, did you say? It must be broken. - No, this button doesn't work. - So what? Push this. - On this. Wow, look, where have you seen a thing like that? It's free, free! Come on... There's a thief here. A thief? - Yes. Miriam, maybe you should call the police? Which police? It's a pity... The poor thing could have killed us. I'm sorry that I woke you like this in the middle of the night, it's... Look, look, if we had... If we had, we would give you, I swear! But, but we don't have anything that's why the shade is open. Do you understand? - It's all because the money for the trip for the boy. I'm not a thief. A thief? What, did you steal anything? The luck of a poor guy! Up there is Mr. Friedman, from the city council, who lives upstairs and travels abroad every year. They say that his wife has had her face lifted like this. - Just like a baby's butt. - A baby's butt. What, from where? It costs a lot of money. Where did they get it? From bribes? Who's that? Where's he going? Here, it's here. I haven't seen him in ages. They say he went to investigations. Once I was in his house, I'm telling you what a house. The whole living room was filled with French antiques and vases and every vase was worth a year's salary. Chinese from China, everything was real. Maybe you should try getting into his house. Nobody's there, you could take a vase or something. I didn't say a word. Here, do you see? It's right there. Here on the second story where the shade is open. I'll return this before they say I broke it. I rented the apartment this morning, with three great windows. Nobody knows. I'm sure we're being followed. This time, if my husband catches us, he'll kill me. But honey, it's not a motel that's very public. Even to the real estate agent I used a fake name. I said that my name is... Come here. So? What, this is the nest? The nest you promised me? Eilon, are you nuts? Look, Eilon, I really love you, close the door. Eilon, this time you went over board. What do you think, that I'm someone off the streets? Why, Razia? Why, my sweet pie? Look what a nice apartment, a beautiful apartment. What do you want? Four big windows. What windows, what air? They will be closed all the time. But really Razia, everything will be okay. Tomorrow I promise you I'll have the apartment furnished with the best. It will be a beautiful apartment. We'll go to the flea market, I'll get you exactly what you like, the furniture that you pick out. It's all because of your jealous husband, I'm guilty? Do you want to almost get caught again in the middle...? It's here where the shade is open. The investigator told me, to come here! Wow, I'll catch them red-handed. Good, it doesn't matter. Listen what I want from you. - Yes. We're going upstairs now. Look at me, you idiot, I want you to take sharp up close pictures. Closeup! I don't care about closeups. Just make sure it's up close. Got it? Check the lights to make sure it works. See that it works okay. If he ever catches me, he'll kill me. - He won't catch us. He can't find out. I even told the agent that my name's Eilon. - This time he'll kill us. - He won't kill us. I know it, this time he'll kill me. Now I burst inside, and you're with me while we storm in and you click the camera... Why are you clinging to me? Give me some space. Give me some space, don't be so close. My husband will kill us. It's the end of us. This time it's really the end. Where is he? Where is he? - Eilon, don't go. - Where is he? Not me, for Christ sakes, I can't see a thing. Move, where is he? Oh God! G'dalia, don't kill me! Here's my wife, the lovely and nice, the pious, the bitch! I'm gonna kill you. Where is he? - Where is he? - Here, over there. There he is, the roach! Here he is, the piece of shit! Come here! Come here! Come here! Here's your Apollo. The dregs of the earth. Here he is! Him? You chose him over me? Come here, take a look, look! Who's more handsome? You're still laughing at me, you idiot? - But I don't even know him. - You don't know him? Maybe with his clothes on you don't know him. She doesn't know... Not me, you asshole. What are you smiling about? Okay, get to work! What do we do? A kiss? You want my wife to kiss that scum bag? What, you're making a whore out of my wife? A good idea. Kiss him. - I don't even know him. I said to kiss him! We need paint, G'dalia. - What? Paint. - Paint's a good idea. Spread this and kiss him. G'dalia, I'm begging you, - I don't know him. - Spread it and kiss him. You don't want to? Okay. What are you taking pictures of? What are you taking pictures of? I want you to photograph the evidence. Why are you shooting me kissing him? You want everyone to think that I'm gay? Nobody will know, I'll blow it up - and put it on a shelf. - On a shelf? A good idea. Are you laughing at me? Wipe the smile off your face, you piece of scum. G'dalia, I'm willing to do anything, just don't kill him. I don't want to hear a word out of you. We'll end this either in court or in the cemetery. I wanted to say... What are you butting in about? What are you smiling about? Wipe the smile off your face, you shit head. Okay, so what do we do now? I once saw a hot pose in a film. Hot? - Yes, the girl... She's on her knees and the guy comes at her from behind. - From the back? - G'dalia, he's nuts. Shut up, you slut! What, you want to make my wife into a slut? It's my wife you want to turn into a whore? - Good idea. - I told you. - Kneel on all fours. - No! Kneel down or I'll kill him. Get down on your knees, come here, you Don Juan. Come here! I want to tell you, I have... What are you so pleased about? Wipe the smile off your face. Don't move! Great! Great! Clean the lens so it will come out nice and clear - for the court. - It's okay. It's okay. You know, that position really is a turn on. It's a mistake... Shithead, that's enough, did you finish enjoying yourself? Come here and take your things. Get out of here. Get out! Just a second, are you the new tenant? Do you know that you haven't paid the house committee yet? It's been four months already. I'm from the house committee and I demand that you pay in full today. What do you think? What are you doing here? So under no circumstances do I agree that you'll turn this respectable house into a whore house! Ma'am... - And wipe that stupid smile from your face while I'm talking to you. Do you hear me? Cheeky! And I want you to pay up today! Today! Shai? Shai? Shai! Good morning! Good morning, my darling, good morning. Good morning... - You've arrived? - Yes. - What, yes! What, what yes? - Where were you all night? - I was out. You were out. I know that you were out. - But, you were out where? - I don't remember, Tikva, I don't remember. I hung out in different places. I paced the floor all night worried sick about you. And you tell me, "I don't remember!" Who were you with? - What do you mean? Who could I have been with? I want you to tell me with what girl were you out with all night that your whole face is covered with her lipstick? I don't remember. I really don't remember, Tikva. I just remember that I was in some house and something fell on me. There were a pair of eyes that looked at me all the time. That put an evil eye on me. There was lighting all the time. Afterwards some woman told me in the morning - that I owe her 70 shekels. - What? - She said that I owe her 70 shekels. - What are you talking about? I don't know. I don't remember. Besides that, I don't feel good. I don't feel good. Tikva, leave me alone. "Welcome to the Party's Jubilee Convention." Gentelmen, please exit the lobby and enter the auditorium. That includes those that are sitting near the kiosk, please leave the lobby area and enter the auditorium. Please. - Mr. Shmueli, how are you? - Fine, thank God. - I haven't seen you in ages. - I haven't either. - I quit with the shit. - That's good. "Henei ma tov uma nayim shevet achim gam yahad." Look, that's the Knesset Member's wife... What's his name? The Crocodile of the Knesset. The one who mediated at the closing down of the clothes factory. Yes, yes. Look what fur and diamonds she's wearing. Where do they have all the money to buy stuff like that if not...? Are you missing diamonds in your life? What do I need diamonds for if I have you? Orit, did you see how much your mother loves me? I'm going to sleep. Ayelet... - Put them to sleep, honey. - I'm also coming to sleep. Asshole, you almost ran me over. Oh, my nose... The screw. The screw. What kind of world is this? Be here exactly at three. Don't make a fool out of me. Trust me. What are you worried about? "Vera! Congratulations on winning the election." - Vera, you have a call. - I have a call? Yes, who's it from? Hello? It's Boazi, my son, just a second. Just a minute, Boazi. Hello, Mom! Yes. Yes. Now. No, of course not. I have time to get a bite and take a shower, and I'm getting picked up at 3 o'clock. But not from the table, Boazi honey, not off the table, that's for the guests that are coming after the election. Good, so go to sleep. But not from the table. Promise! Okay. Bye. Vera! - Yes, Verashvski. Boazi is here. - Yes? Great! - But only for three hours. - Will he be at the convention? No, he won't be. I told him not to come. - He's very tired. - What a pity. In the beginning he wanted to, but I told him not to. - Let me have your speech. - What speech? My speech that I have to give. What's this, Shmuel? I told you to bring my speech. You didn't tell me to take anything. - I'm going crazy. Shmuel, what am I to do now? Shmuel? Okay, I'll ask... Ruti! Ruti, come here for a moment, dear. Ruti! I'll ask Ruti. She'll bring it for me. I'll ask... What? - Do me a favor. He forgot my speech at home. It's on the bookstand in the bedroom sweety. - The speech? Yes, take the keys, take the car, and drive very carefully. Here are the keys to the house and these are for the alarm. It's very important that you turn off the alarm, do you understand? Boazi is sleeping. Do it quickly, okay, honey? Drive carefully, honey! I don't have a choice. - How could you do this to me? - You didn't tell me. Yes I did. Ruti, what are you doing here? I can't find the key to the alarm. Why are you hysterical? Come here, did you come looking for me? - You wish. Your mother sent me to get the speech and to check that everything is ready for the party. So Mom's already been elected? No, they are about to vote any moment. - It's final? - What's final? Boaz, I have to get the speech. - What's wrong? Are you mad at me? - Mad, no, of course not! For two weeks you haven't called, why should I be mad? You don't understand that I'm in the reserves for the month? You think I'm enjoying myself there? - I don't care. - You don't care? - I don't care. And besides that I need to go get the speech. - The speech? - Yes, the speech. - The speech? - The speech. The speech... Nothing, nothing! "My Granddaughter Vera From Grandma Sabina." Grandma Sabina. That's enough Boaz, I know the whole story with Tami. - Tami? - Yes, Tami, your secretary. - That little slut, Ruti. That slut, that communal mattress of yours. - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? Every time I call you, she laughs at me on the phone. Ruti, that's her natural laugh. You should see her. She's nothing. I've seen her. I saw her at a party. A party! At the party she had makeup on, if you'd seen her without it, - you wouldn't be concerned. - You saw her without makeup? Ruti, you're really something else! - The speech! - What, which speech? - The speech. No, I have to bring it to the convention, - your mother is waiting for it. - Forget about the speech, Ruti. No, I have to get to the convention. You'll get there, you'll make it. By the time of the vote, you'll make it. Boaz, stop it. I can't do it on your parent's bed. It's not nice. - Okay, okay. - What was that about? - What? What about what? - Someone is here. - Nobody is here. Dear friends, you all know how much I appreciate and value our veteran and loyal member, Vera Vertman. May I ask Vera to join us here on the stage. They're waiting for me at the convention. - Let them wait. Hello? Yes. At the convention. Can you call later? Thanks. - What was that? - Just a journalist. But I feel that someone's here. No one's here, only me. but before we go to the vote, let's decide on a second candidate, a different candidate very close to her and very experienced in pressing economic issues. I invite Mr. Vertman to the stage. For us, Vera is our representative. For us, Vertman is our representative. Quiet! It's a legitimate democratic process. We are all one family, that are interested in one thing: All we want is for the good of the party. Lonik! Lonik! Who's for Shmuel Vertman, please raise your hand. One... Who's for Shmuel Vertman, put your hands up. One, two, three... Quiet, quiet, gentleman! The eyes of the nation are turned to us. Gentleman, I'm asking you, take a seat, return to your seats so we can begin with the voting in a democratic fashion. Stop this immediately, it's enough! "So long as still within our breasts." "The heart beats true..." The coat, the coat, open the door, oh shit! What's this? I'm waiting for the speech and she's still here. - Maybe she didn't find it. - Drive, drive, it doesn't matter. The convention is over, the speech. I'm in a hurry. Hand me the dress quickly, quickly. It's okay. Calm down. - I won't be able to look at your mother. - There's no problem. - I'm gonna die. - She won't come up here. So! - You can leave through the porch. - Are you a friend of Boaz? - Sure. - From the army? - Sure. - Did you shower? - Sure. Can you say anything else - besides "sure"? - Sure. - When did you get here? Where's Ruti? Where did they run off to? I can check. Boaz, Ruti... - That's Boaz. - Mom, she took the speech and ran to the convention. - The convention I thought she's running after you. Where's Dad? Hypocrite and a cheat! Thief and bandit! Ma'am I think you're exaggerating. Mom, I understand that I can congratulate you. Dad doesn't need anything. "Vera! Congratulations" Can we remove these decorations? Throw it in the trash! Mom, what happened? You weren't elected? Let's not talk about it, okay? Because I'm fuming! Fuming! I'll make him so jealous. I have no idea what's going on here. I'll kill him. I'll kill him. Thief! - Why is she yelling? They'll think a thief is here. Forget it, you know how she is. - Sure. - From the party? - Sure. Listen, you have to tell me what happened there. No, I don't have to, I have to go. Forget it, At least wait 'til Dad gets back. Come sit down. Boaz. - Batito. - Excuse me. - Batito. I understand that you're also in the Movement. Lately, I've been doing a lot of moves. You know, I can't grasp people like you. - No, there are those that can grasp. - Day and night. Lately, only at night. Yes? Do you at least find satisfaction? Not really satisfaction, but at least a livelihood. - At least you admit it. - No, I don't admit it. Sometimes you could sit for years. - You're telling me? - Of course, on condition... No, on probation. - And to check the paper for your name. Believe me, I personally am not interested in publicity. - Do you know what you are? - What? - An idealist. Idea what? - Idealist... That's what you are. - Idealist? Look, I... sometimes it's part of... It's part of the profession, you understand, I need to go. Wait a second, you didn't tell me what happened at the board meeting. Don't ask what happened at the meeting. - Yes. Don't ask about what happened at the meeting, they sat and sat and there were more meetings and you know how it is at meetings when there's a meeting they sit. They need to sit on it. At the meeting, what happened was that they sat and sat... No, no, Verashvski, it'll be okay. Believe me, it will be okay. You shouldn't get so agitated. It'll be OK. She needs to calm down. Don't ask what I've been through, I... you can't, I... I didn't intend to stay for so long. - Okay. - Bye, Boaz. - See you, Batito. - See you. Goodbye. - This is my house... - Dad, Dad calm down. - Please meet Batito. - Batman. - From the Movement? - Sure! - From which department? From Acquisitions. - I'm from the board of directors, on the side. I'm also on the sidelines. Come sit down. Make yourself at home. Batman, is she still upstairs? Don't ask how pissed off she is with you. Why don't you go upstairs and calm her down a little? It won't help. Batman, if you hear of differences of opinion in the family. "Tell it not in Gat, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon." No, I'm not going to Ashkelon. I'm... by chance I'm... You don't desert a sinking ship. That's right. But that ship has given me sea sickness. - Do you want to hear what happened? - Don't start with it. Boazi, you look horrible, what happened, son? You're so thin, it's terrible, honey. You don't look so good yourself. Let's go have something to eat. Boazi, don't be afraid of my threats to your dad. Are you listening? Sit down, my dear. - Come on. - I'll make coffee. Yes, have a seat. Feel at home. What a mess! Where are the spoons? How can I serve coffee like this? No, no, we don't need coffee. - Mom, I want coffee. - So we don't need spoons. - Something alcoholic? - For me that'd be nice. - I want a Bloody Mary. - And you? I... Maybe you have a Bloody Arak? Mom, some journalist was looking for you. Gabriela. - That's just what we need now. I'm not interested in publicity right now either. I agree with your friend. She's already turned us into friends. We're all friends in Israel. One Arak, one Mary, give your mother one. - Thanks, dad. - Cheers! - Cheers, Batito. - Cheers. Cheers! - Cheers! May I have another one, please. Excuse me. How could you do such a thing to me? I devoted my life to the Party. The Social Welfare Department is whom? - It's him. No, it's me. - "The Baby Project" is whom? - It's him? No, it's me. "Lend a Hand to an immigrant", is whom? - That's me the immigrant. - No, of course not. It's him? - No it's not him, it's me. And then my dear husband, the poisonous snake, stole it. The neighbors will hear her and call for a patrol car. You'll excuse us for these expressions? On the contrary, I feel at home. Maybe we'll continue this later? - No, if I'm bothering... - Doesn't matter, let him hear it. How could you! If you can't get along without me... We're fine. It shows that you're in the Social Welfare Dept. Look how many welfare cases there are in this country. That's true. There are many welfare cases in this country. Everyone's against me in this house. They're all deserting me. Oh come on, don't start crying. Don't cry. Come on now. You're not deserving of a wife like me. You don't deserve it! You hate me, right? You really hate me. I really don't hate you. Not you, him! How could you? This villa, my dear husband, this villa, is from the money you got to build a nursery school downtown. Maybe for once you should decide what to do. We simply need to decide which one of us will run for Knesset. As far as I'm concerned, he can run for the Knesset. Why don't you decide already before this herring comes out of my ears. Batito, we were prepared for twenty guests. Maybe you could give in to him... You need to give in. Stop it! I can't deal with this. I'm going back to the army. I'm sick of this house. Do you see? Do you see what you did to the boy? You stole him. - He's such a sensitive boy. - Sensitive. Yes, he got it from me, not from you. - We heard already. - I'm his mother. With a mother like that it would be better being an orphan. - You high class whore! - Everyone stood in line for me! I don't have the strength for this. the services she provides for members of the party. I hate him! - Batman, let's go. - Go! Go to Verashvski. But I'll get the position. And only I'll sit in the Knesset, dear Sir. I'll sit in the Knesset and tell Verashvski, that I know about the bank account you have in Switzerland. Yes, I do know. 425 million dollars that you stole from the party and hid away in a Swiss bank account. Would you like to know the number of the account? The number is 623715. I told you that I know. What are you looking at me for? As far as I'm concerned you could have left ages ago. Get out! So, Verashvski told you about that as well? And you went with him behind my back! - My wife turns against me? - You're starting up again? Harlot! Still keeping up with your movements... Don't mention the Movement. Six, seven, three, seven, one, five. without me you're zero. - Since back then you're making eyes... And you didn't go behind my back to Verashvski? You went behind both our backs to Verashvski? - You're smart! - Don't start fighting! I have an offer you can't refuse. Just a moment. Heads or tails? Believe me, there's nothing more democratic than this. Heads! - I'm heads! - You really are an empty head. - Tails. Tails. Where is it? Just a moment, Sir, Mr. Vertman... Just a second... Excuse me, Mrs. Vera... What are you looking for over there? - A coin. Boazi, wait a second. Wait just one second, my dear. Your friend decided to flip a coin for it. Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry we ruined your evening. It won't happen again, I promise you. Boazi sweety, tell that friend of yours Batito that he shouldn't say anything in the army. - What friend of mine? Batito's your friend from the army, no? No? - He's your friend, no? Wait a minute. - He's your friend, his friend, Everyone in Israel are friends. From the party, no? From the party... from the house... from life... - He came with Mom, no? - No, of course not! He came with you from the army, no? - No. You didn't say that you were from Acquisitions? - Sure. Wait a minute. When I came into the house he was on the stairs - and after a shower. - That's right. Batito! What's going on here? - Batman, who are you? - Batito! God damit, who are you? Shmuel! Hey man, who are you? The spoons! Shmuel, Shmuel! Shmuel, a thief! It's busy. Dad, I got to get going. I'm telling you that I'm not staying with him down here. Don't worry, Mom, in his condition he wouldn't be able to harm a fly. What a hell of a night. All I wanted to do was catch a couple hours of sleep. See you, Dad. So Batito, from the party? You've ruined my evening. Don't say a thing in the army, do you hear? You have a nice boy, really nice. How did you sleep? - A great night, dead as a log. - Really now! Drive! - Let me go! - It's busy. I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'll show you. You stole all the herring. I'll show you... Wait, wait... Mrs. Vera, I... Shmuel, Shmuel! If I was you, Mr. Vertman, I wouldn't call. - You still have the nerve to talk? - You know what? Call. Call the police, go ahead and call. Call Verashvski also. Plan whatever you want. I'll do my own figuring. What's wrong with me doing my own figuring? I'll tell the whole world about 425 million dollars that you stole and hid away in Switzerland and you put it in a safe. And you think I don't know the account number for the safe? Six, two, three, seven, one, five. I'll repeat it: 623715. Now you can do whatever you want. So, call. Yes, call. Why aren't you calling? Go ahead and call. Mr. Batman. Just between the two of us you're in a fairly shitty position. And you're not in a fairly shitty position? - You have nerve. Let me, I'll show him. I'll show him. I swear that I'll still kill you. I'll kill you! Murder? - Why not kill him? - It's not a good idea. You swear that you won't tell a sole what you heard here? I'm simply a small time thief. Just a moment, just a moment. Why shouldn't we behave as if we were human beings? Come on, Vera. Come and have a seat. Relax a bit. Mr. Vertman, Mr. Vertman, I swear not to say a word to anyone. You understand, Mr. Vertman, I'm simply unemployed with seven kids. It all began because of the money my boy needed for a school trip. Mr. Vertman, I think I'm in shock. I lost my memory. Believe me, Mr. Vertman. Even your name I don't remember. Even the number of the bank account six, two, three, seven, one, five, I already forgot. I'm asking for a little pity from you Mr. Vertman. A bit of pity. Shmuel, what are you doing? What's that? - Leave me alone! - Mercy! Get up, get up, calm down. Get up... Sit down... sit! - Sit down already! - To sit with a dirty thief? Soon you'll be inviting him to sleep with us. I didn't bring my pajamas. - Tighten it, tighten the spring. - You little thief. You piece of shit! Bigger thieves than you have been caught. - Are you sure? - He's just a little extortioner. - Extortioner? - Extortioner! - I'm an extortioner? - You're an extortioner! If I'm an extortioner, how much do you pay a little extortioner, who won't go tell the whole world what he knows? I knew this was coming. One thousand dollars. One thousand dollars and that's it. Take it or leave it. Not a sent more. You have no luck, just a month ago we changed the furniture, what do you say about that? Maybe you have a cigar, Mr. Vertman? - Please. Actually you said that you're unemployed, right? Maybe we could help you out through our Social Welfare Department, what do you think? Tell me, are you a party member? No, no, I'm from the Opposition. Okay, if you don't want, so maybe I'll be going. No, no! Have a seat and a cigar. - I never smoked a cigar before. - Please. Mr. Batman, we can both speak as cultured people, right? Cultured? - Yes. - Okay. - Nice. - Let's be cultured... - Please. With lots of culture... - With culture... - Yes. - I... I didn't see that you offered any constructive or cultured proposals that would turn me into a happy and cultured man. Besides that since I've finished your Bloody Arak, I don't think I have anything else to do here. Maybe I'll go to the papers? Maybe I'll go to the television? Then they'll have a reason for a real celebration. Hold it, what are you angry about? Let's sit and talk about it. - Where are you going? - Bring me the thousand dollars. Vera, what did you do? Get that off him before he suffocates, Shmuel. I'm afraid, maybe he's electricuted. - Oh, no! Dear God, he's not breathing. What did you do? You killed him. Can you not be so hysterical? Relax. - Do you have immunity? - I'm not a Knesset member yet. What do I do? I can already see my picture in the paper tomorrow. What a catastrophe. Let's throw him somewhere. - But Boaz knows about him. - I'll speak with him. I don't know what to think. Wait, maybe we'll take him to the ocean? We'll throw him in. They'll think he was drunk. What are you saying, dear Vera? Instead of talking, let's get him into the car. Help me, help me! Pick up...! That's it! Get him by the legs. Put him in the trunk. I can't, I can't... We'll put him in the back seat. Open the door, I can't. He's so heavy. Straighten his legs. That leg. Shmuel, drive already, drive! What's this, don't you have a house? Why are you outside? Oh my Lord, where are we? Let's go... Let's get out of here, before someone sees us. Get in, get in. Get into the car. - I'm getting in. Throw the things, tie the boat. Get up here already, we're wasting time. Come on! Captain, the guys have been waiting all night. I think they tricked us. There's no trick. The information was correct. You stay in your positions. Help! Bring the binoculars. Wow! Here he is. That's him, Abu Halil. I've been waiting for that scum bag for two years. Now, I'm gonna get him. Stay in your positions. Abu Halil? Come here, Abu Halil. Is this Beirut? Of course it's Beirut. Where were you? Come here! Finally I got you, Abu Halil! I'm not Abu Halil, I'm Batito. Batito, huh? - Batito. What do you mean? Are you kidding me or what? - What are these stories? - I'm not telling any stories. Captain Shisal, believe me, last night some electrical things fell on me and my whole head has been electrical things and lots of lightening and suddenly I woke up and I was inside a boat. Far out in the ocean. I was frightened and scared, and used the board of the seat I did like this... and the boat drowned at sea and I... I started swimming and suddenly I saw these wheels from the car man... Thank God, I was able to grab onto it. Tell me, what are you babbling about? You don't have any connection to this hash? What are jabbering on? Believe me, Captain Shisal, I told you the whole truth and only the truth. - Maybe it's possible... - What? Could I have a drink of water? I'm so thirsty thanks to the herring last night. - Why not? There are other ways of doing an investigation. Tell me, how long do you think I'll keep listening to your b.s.? Captain Shisal, call the Vertman family. What? - Phone up the Vertman family. Which Vertman? - Vertman from the party with the convention. Shmuel Vertman? - Vertman. What kind of a relationship do you have with Vertman? - A connection. Ask them who's Batito. Hello? Captain Shisal? Good morning, Captain. Yes, yes, how are you? Yes, yes, were you at the convention yesterday? No, I wasn't at the convention. She knows me. - Mrs. Vertman, I'd like to ask you about someone named Batito. Batito? Just a moment, Captain. I'm sure my husband could help you out. - Shmuel! - Yes, Ma'am. - Go call my husband, quickly. He's coming, just a moment. Yes, Shmuel. What are you yelling about? Nothing was said on the radio. Captain Shisal, come here. Captain Shisal. Captain Shisal, take it. Hello, Captain Shisal? Mr. Vetman, I'd like to ask you about a man who works for you named Batito. Batman? - Batman? - Batito. - Batito. - Yes, Batman. - I'm asking you - to come down to the station. - No problem, no, no problem. We're on our way to the convention anyway, we'll stop by before. See you later, Captain. - They found the body. - We're done for. Captain Shisal, may I have a glass of water? I need to... Very salty taste in my mouth. What? What happened? Hey, come here. So as we agreed, he was over at the house last night, drank a whole bottle of Arak and went home happy as a bee. That's all we have to say. Along with that you could add that you knew him from your Social Welfare Department. Like I told you, the most important thing is not to lose your nerve. Just stay calm. Keep composed. Stay cool... He's dead. - Mr. Vertman. Hello, Mr. Vertman. - Hello, Captain Shisal. - Please, come into the office. - Yes. She was the one with the lampshade, hit him... Shmuel, are you nuts? What's wrong with you? - With the lampshade. - Shmuel what's wrong with you? I saw him. Monster, you said that you wouldn't say a word. Excuse me Ma'am... wait a sec... We are at the police station, just a moment! I can't stand it with you any longer. Mrs. Vertman, I'm asking you. What's with you? What's going on here? We are in a police station. It's not a convention. I saw you on TV last night. What television? I'm gonna give it to him... I'll show him... He's gonna get it... I'll show him... Leave me alone! Let me out! I'm asking you, just a minute. Why didn't you tell me such important people were coming? I would have made them something to eat. There's no need, get inside the house and don't interfere. Instead of being at the convention we're here. I explained to Verashvski the whole situation. They're waiting for us. It'll be okay. I'm really sorry, Mr. Vertman - that you had to wait so long. - That's okay. I felt terrible. Now I feel much better. Batman, we have to get to the convention. I want us to speak openly, okay? How can we compensate you? Batman, I see the situation. Think about it, don't be modest. I'll abide by any request. You see. I... Batman, don't stammer. We're among friends, right? If we're among friends. - I have problems with my teeth. - Yes. - Right here. - Yes. - Yes, I can see. - I pulled them out by myself. - Yes. And when I chew. - Yes. - Sometimes all the food stays in my mouth. - It doesn't get grinded. - Yes. I don't have money to go to the dentist. That's no problem. Vera, tomorrow morning call your dentist and we'll make your mouth as good as new, right? As good as new. And... - Yes, yes, yes? My daughter, Orit. - Yes? Such a sweetheart. Really wonderful. Believe me. - Yes. She's studying for her final exams. - Nice! Yes. - All day long Michael Jackson. - Jackson, yes. - Michael Jackson. And if possible for college, some assistance like a scholarship. - Believe me, God endowed her. - She's gifted? Gifted. - Gifted children are Vera's department. Vera, we'll favor her, right, Vera? - Blessed favors. And... - Yes, yes, yes? I want a little money. From the account of the safe over there in Switzerland, 623715. Not a lot, just a bit. Not too much. - You still remember the number? - I forgot. Well done, well done. Really well done, Vera? How much? - It's not for me. Believe me, it's not for me. How much? - For our factory. Believe me, the workers are good people. Twenty-two years we've worked at the factory. My spine goes... due to the tractor... I'm telling you that the management stole the money. The management stole the money. Calm down Batman, you're a good man. You bring tears to my eyes. Isn't that right he brings tears to my eyes, Vera? You don't think about yourself, Batman. Batman, you'll be the factory manager and I'll make sure that they return the funds from Switzerland. - I'll take responsibility for it. - You'll take responsibility! I'm telling you, I'll take care of it. - And... - Yes, yes... - Is it possible? - Everything is possible, Batman. - Only if it's possible. - Anything. - I would like... - Yes. I'd like to be a candidate to the party instead of you - and be elected to the Knesset. - What did you say? I want to be elected to the party and afterwards to the Knesset. Of all the nerve! Vera, calm down. Relax! Batman. I'm gonna kill you. I'll kill you. Tell your husband. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll show you, I'll show you... I'll show you what happens if you touch my husband. - I'll show you... - Batman! - I'll show you. I'm telling you, leave me alone. Let me go! - Batman, tell her. - I'll show you who Batman is. - Batman, help! - Let go of me. Batman, look what she did to me. What did you do to him? I told you not to get involved. Go into the house! Batman, look what she did. Why did she do that? I wasn't okay? Take a look at me. I gave you the teeth that you wanted. I helped your daughter. I gave you the money from Switzerland. You're going to be the manger of the institution. I can't have you elected to the party. We have democratic elections. Why is she doing this to me, Batman? Take this, go let Vera clean off the egg - and we'll meet in the car. - Vera? What are you laughing about? Stop laughing. What's so funny? Shmuel, look where you've gotten. Okay, okay, very funny. Okay, okay... Mr. Vertman? - Yes. - My wife would like to apologize. - It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. But with us it's unacceptable to have a hand raised on your husband. Take the beret so you won't catch a cold. You're after a shower. Okay, take the towel and go inside. Batman, let's talk about it. You can't be elected. It's a party issue but I have an offer you won't be able to refuse. Ten thousand dollars and part of it in security bonds. What do you say? I say that you still owe me another half a shekel. From the coin toss. - Right, I was heads. - I was heads. I was heads. - I was heads. You were a dumb head. You can't demand from us that you be elected. You want to see me. There'll be a big commotion in the party. - A plowing of the fields. "Planting of tears, Reaping of joy." My whole life I devoted to the party. What will my future hold? - What will my future hold? - That's the difference between us. You have a future, and I only have a past. Wait, Batman, don't go, let's go to the convention and talk. Come on, get into the car. Get in and we'll talk there. Forget about the convention, let's just call Verashvski we'll go to some restaurant, and settle everything over a beer. As much as I drink, I'm still thirsty from all that herring last night. Drive! In my opinion they should have been here by now. They went to a different place. Where did they go to? To a restaurant at the Mesubim junction. Mr. Verashvski, this sounds very serious. - Do you know where it is? - Yes. - Take us there. - Okay. "Tikva's Grilled Meat Restaurant." Hello, Mr. Verashvski, I'm very very pleased - to finally meet you. - I'd like a small group of friends to meet to clarify the details. Don't worry, Mr. Verashvski, don't worry. The party's secret is sealed here in my heart. Just like in a safe in Switzerland, 623715. - I'm happy that you understand. - I'm happy that you're happy. Smartass bandit, Al Capone. Why are you standing? Why are you standing? Sit, sit. Have a seat. Feel at home. Waiter, put a spread on the table fit for a king. It's all on me today. - How was it? Is everything okay? - The fish was great. - Would you like anything else? - What do you have? We have ribs. - On the grill? On the grill. - Make them... well done, okay? Mr. Vertman, pass me the humus. Until he brings the ribs, we'll enjoy the... Why aren't you eating anything? Sit down and have something to eat. Eat something. It's a pity that it will get cold. - Why not Ma'am. It's very good. - Excellent. It's not like the herring you had at home. - That's right. A completely different taste. - Vera, what a surprise! - Hello, Gabriela. - Hello. - I hope I'm not disturbing. - No. - Of course you're not disturbing. I'm happy even if you were disturbing a little. So to whom may I offer my well wishes? No, we haven't gotten to the well wishing stage yet. We are just at the stage of wishing. Excuse me? - Yes, what did you want? - Who are you anyway? I'm... Sason Batito... I will help the people and all the workers so that there will be food for everyone to eat. And more than anything I'll take care of the soccer teams. I understand that you are one of the candidates for the elections. You understand correctly and I believe they don't have a choice. Mr. Vertman, let me have the... no, no... - There, the salad at the end. - The salad, the salad. - I need your picture. - A picture? - Yes, I need a picture of you. - My picture? I think the police have one. A profile and a close up. - You have a real sense of humor. - He'll make it. - Thank you. What a scoop! What a scoop! Where are you? - Just a second. Look here, look! Great! "Welcome to the Party's Jubilee Convention." Wonderful! What a great suit! "He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill." It's fantastic how you took care of things at the factory. The management dispersed and everyone's talking about you. - Believe me, it's all from God. - May God help you, Amen. Believe me I miss the factory. I'm not cut out for all this party and convention stuff. Believe me, it's a jungle. They're animals. They're not human, believe me. It's not for me. They'll do it to you. Don't be afraid. I must go in to welcome the people. Good. - With your permission. Ben Porat Yosseph, what nice children you have. Save the first row before there won't be any room left. Sit next to Mrs. Vera and Mrs. Ruti, quickly. But how will you speak to them? Did you prepare a speech? I'll take the speech, I spoke with Ruti about I'll using Vera's speech. I would kiss you, put I don't want to get you dirty. What are you spitting on my hand for? - Children come on. - Go in already. I see that you brought the whole tribe with you. - God bless them. - Very nice, Mrs. Batito. Hello, Mr. Batito. I'd like to wish you good luck. - Thank you. - Good luck! - Thank you. - You look familiar. - Sure, you don't remember? Where do I know you from? You don't remember me? I... I'll give you a hint. My wife has been a fan of yours for years. And in line with her, so am I. Here, look. Nice, huh? I thought it was a dream. No, it's no dream! It's reality. Here you are on top, and she's underneath. You came to swindle me? - Me, a swindler? - You are an extortioner. No, of course not. - So, why did you bring the pictures? No, of course not, look it's... Wait, let's say I was a blackmailer, how much would you pay to a swindler like me to keep our little secret? I'll give you a more constructive answer later. Forget the constructive, just make sure it's in large bills. - How much? - Later. Wow, believe me, you're really something, we love you! All the best! Dear friends, I am happy to tell you that the Party has unanimously decided, without any abstentions, to choose Mr. Batito as vice... - Ruti, let me have the speech. - Good luck. That's my speech, Ruti. - I don't know how to give a speech I'd like to invite Mr. Batito to the stage. Mr. Batito grew up amongst us. Step by step he advanced in the community reaching his goals through his actions. Mr. Batito, I ask you to say a few words. Bravo, bravo! "Ladies, and gentlemen." I'm standing before you, filled with excitement. "I wasn't expecting this honor - "and I'm not deserving of it." - Bravo! "I'm just a small screw" Bravo "in the workings, and maybe I'm not a screw at all." - "But rather a nail." - Bravo! Very nice. "And maybe I'm not a nail, but rather a tack." "A tack stuck in the sides of some of the members." This speech isn't for me. Mrs. Vera, this isn't a speech, it's a junk yard. It's the speech that I wrote, Batito. You should have read it with more emotion. I'm very sorry, Mr. Verashvski, members of the board, party members, it's not for me all this bullshit. - All this politics, I... - What do you mean? I relinquish my candidacy. - What is he doing? - What does that mean, Batito? I don't want screws... My candidacy is up for election. What are you fighting over? What are you fighting about? Over honor? To get to the Knesset? Such an honor, you don't understand that this whole country laughs at Knesset members that run after the television and then afterwards they show them asleep in the Knesset. You have no idea what goes on with normal people. What normal people feel. People are suffocating here. Move! This country is suffocating. It has no air. No, I don't agree. Open up the doors and the windows. - This country needs air. - Don't let him resign. He represents the silent majority. What are you doing to me, you scum. I was counting on you. Everyone's behind you, sweety! Batito! Batito! Gentlemen. I'm closing the meeting. "So long as still within our breasts." "The heart beats true..." Move! Move! - Hello, where is your manager? - Over there! Work manager. That's the suit of a work manager? - It's what they made for me. - Good, so cut with the bullshit. Tell me, where's the constructive answer that you spoke of? You think I have time for your construction? Where's the constructive answer? Would you like me to show those pictures to all the workers here at the factory? Is that what you want? You want to show those pictures to my workers. Those pictures you want to show to my workers? That's a good idea. Guys, take a look, that's his wife, - that's you here, no? - I'm here. Yes, that's me here. I'm here on top looking down. That position is a real turn on. Wow, can I have her number? You're making a whore out of my wife? A whore? That's a good idea. "Batito the Unemployed." Translation: Beth Kuzi. Subtitles: Elrom Studios
