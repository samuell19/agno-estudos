Forever! I'm warning you, young man. This is your last chance. Now, go. (SHOUTS) Go! (QUEEN WEEPING) Oh... The Queen's filling the royal pond with her tears. Why is she so sad?

Why, only yesterday, I turned an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. You did? With special spells. You mean you might even have a very special spell just for me? You see, for so long, I've wanted a child. Still, I have none. Well... If I gathered the tail of a rabbit and some apple cider, take some fresh snow from a hilltop, and from a true queen, take a teardrop, and with this rosebush... It has the power. Put under your pillow, it will flower. And with all this magic from the wild, within a year, you will have a child. Oh! What? (FANFARE IN DISTANCE) Oh, the King! ADVISOR: Ah, the King's carriage!

(BIRDS COOING) (INHALES DEEPLY) (CORK POPS) Hey! (HICCUPS) (LAUGHING) Oh, she's gorgeous. Oh, she looks just like you. What's her name? What shall we call her? When I longed for a child, I was given some magic in the form of a thorn rose. I've decided to call her Rosebud. Oh. (ROSEBUD GURGLING) Dearest Queen... Fairest Princess. We shall proclaim this day a day of feasting and merriment to let all the kingdoms and all our subjects know that we have a new princess! PEOPLE: Oh. (EXCLAIMING) Furthermore, we shall have to make a list. Now, let me see... There are the dukes and duchesses, the barons and baronesses, the counts and countesses... Umm... Uh... The lords and ladies. Yes, the lords and ladieses... "The lords and ladieses." Am I going too fast for you? "Am I going too..." (LAUGHING) No. No! And to bestow good graces upon the Princess, we must invite all the fairies of all the lands. All the fairies? Of all the lands? (PEOPLE MUTTERING) Yes. Oh, what an excellent idea. Of course, my darling, we shall send out invitations to all the fairies in all the lands. Take this down. Um... "Spirits of the universe..." No. "Honored magical guests..." Hah! I have it! "Dear fairies..." Oh! (BANGING STICK) (BANGING HARDER) (RESOUNDING CLANG) By royal proclamation, the King has ordered that a great feast be held to celebrate the birth of the Princess Rosebud. (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) All the most important people will be there, especially all the fairies from all the lands! Therefore, it is vital that you prepare the nine golden plates! Mmm... (CHUCKLES) Yuck! Well? Boy! One. Two. Three. (SPITS) Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine... What is it? There aren't enough golden plates. What?

(CROWD EXCLAIMING) Do you know what this means? No! Well, it means... It means... Tell him. Tell him what it means. (STAMMERING) It means that the fairies can only eat off golden plates, you fat... Sire, this means we'll have to scratch one of the fairies off the list. Oh, but can we do that? No! No, we cannot do that! My Lord, each of the fairies will bestow upon the Princess a very important gift. Now, if one of them is not invited, Rosebud could be missing a virtue. Ah! Well, then we shall examine the list very, very carefully. Bring... Bring me the fairy list. Fairy list! Bring the fairy list! That one. (GASPS) Oh, Sire, not the Fairy of Blue. Why, she is the fairy of beauty. She will bestow great beauty upon the Princess. Oh. Well, then... That one, the Fairy of White. Oh, no, no, My Lord. She is the fairy of wisdom. Oh, well, then... How about this one? The Fairy of Gold. No, no, no, no, no. No, My Lord. She lives next door. Oh, next door. Well... Here. Who's this one? The Fairy of Red. I haven't heard of her before, Sire. She must live very far away. I'm sure she won't be missed. (LAUGHING) Well... Then there we have it. Make sure you do not invite the ninth fairy on the list, the Fairy of Red.

Dear Queen and King, for I still have my gift to bring. She'll prick her finger on a spindle, but sleep, not death, is all it will kindle. And she will sleep 100 years so by my gift your evil clears. She will awaken from sleepy bliss when a true prince finds and wakes her with a kiss. Fairy of White! Is there nothing more that we can do? (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) ELF: Psst! Psst!

Where did this cloth come from? Oh, this was made a long time ago. Long before you were born. Now we don't make cloth anymore. But why? Because... We just don't. Doesn't anyone make cloth anywhere? Maybe someone makes cloth somewhere. Where, Nana? Well... There must be a king in a country far, far away. And in this kingdom, there are many wheels upon which they spin yarn. And all the people in the country are very happy. Except for the Prince. Why is the Prince so sad? Well, he's looking for a princess. But he cannot find one. Maybe he shall find me! I'm a princess, am I not? And then we shall have all the cloth we need to make fine new clothes. And I'll get you a new apron, and a new dress for my mother, the Queen. And a new robe for my father, the King. Oh, Nana... Rosebud, wait. (GASPS) I mean, look at this! And this! WOMAN: What about me? Look at this! MAN: What about me? I can't stand it any longer!

No. But I'm supposed to be Rosebud's guardian, and her parents are due any moment now. Has it been 16 years already? Time certainly flies! Yeah. Yeah, but it happened. She pricked her finger, and she fell asleep. Of course she has. It's fate. I did all I could at that party. But can't you wake her? No one can, at least not for 100 years. A hundred years? Oh, poor Rosebud. She'll be all alone when she wakes up. That's terrible. Now, now. You'll be there for her, won't you? Yeah. But her mom and her dad and all her friends.

There once was a princess by the name of Rosebud, so pure, so gracious, but she pricked her finger and it couldn't be worse, 'cause now she's branded with a terrible curse and has to sleep for 100 years. And no one has come to save her yet? Yes. Many have come, but none of them have been true princes. And now the Princess sleeps to this very day, waiting for the right prince to awaken her. I am a prince. I am on a quest. But this castle is not on my map. Let me see! You're right. It's not there. You see, Sire, this kingdom here is a trap. You've seen the skeletons.
