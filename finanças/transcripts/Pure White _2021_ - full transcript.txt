Can I talk to my son alone, head? ﻿Sure. ﻿Did you cheat in the exam? ﻿Did you cheat, son? ﻿No. ﻿Then why won't you look at me? ﻿Look at me. ﻿I swear I didn't. ﻿So why is your paper a copy of your friend's? ﻿Ali. ﻿Ali what? ﻿His name is Ali. ﻿Okay, his name is Ali, but why are your papers the same? ﻿Weren't you sitting behind him? ﻿I took a picture of my paper. ﻿Then you sent it to Ali? ﻿Why did you do that, son? ﻿He said if he failed, his dad would beat him up. ﻿Why didn't you tell your teacher? ﻿Because we're friends. ﻿Come here. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come here. ﻿PURE WHITE ﻿What's the purpose of your visit? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿What's the purpose of your visit? ﻿What's the purpose of your visit? ﻿Tourism. ﻿It's so cold in here! ﻿Have you had the window open? ﻿I opened the door at one point. ﻿Were you smoking again? ﻿Of course not! I'm done with that. ﻿I saw a bug there and threw it out. ﻿In this weather? ﻿It's the cold that drives them in. ﻿If it snowed, it wouldn't be so bitterly cold. ﻿But there's no sign of it. ﻿Have you seen that? ﻿Seen what? ﻿Those two big cracks in the wall. ﻿- What cracks, son? - Take a look. ﻿Weird or what! ﻿How did it happen? The cold, I guess. ﻿It's not the cold, son. ﻿Then how did it happen? ﻿You'd better call someone to fix it. ﻿No. They'd charge a fortune. I'll do it myself. ﻿Never mind the money. ﻿I don't want the shop looking like this. ﻿I don't get it. ﻿How can I help? ﻿No, let me help. ﻿Remember you took my photo? For a visa application. ﻿Yes? ﻿They didn't accept the photo. ﻿How come? ﻿They said my ears should show. ﻿But they were showing. ﻿Let me take a look. ﻿Exactly. They show. ﻿They said they didn't. ﻿But they do. ﻿They said they didn't. I had to get another appointment. ﻿I don't get it. Why are they like that? ﻿Okay, we'll take another one. Go on through. ﻿Let me take that. ﻿- Will it take long, son? - No. ﻿I'm almost done. ﻿Be quick. ﻿It's time to go. ﻿Stop! Stop! Someone will see. ﻿When's your new appointment? ﻿Wednesday. ﻿Wednesday. ﻿They won't give you a visa. ﻿Okay, let's say they did. What would you do in America? ﻿Huh? ﻿Go and clean houses? ﻿It's better than here. ﻿Are you running away from him? ﻿Or from me? ﻿He was back here two days ago. ﻿You never said. ﻿What difference would it make? ﻿Did he do anything to you? ﻿Did he hit you? ﻿No. ﻿Did he do anything else? ﻿- Did he? - No. ﻿He brought knuckledusters. With blood on them. ﻿And he left a gun. ﻿Why? ﻿He said he'd got into a situation. ﻿He told me to hide them. ﻿He said he won't be back for a while. ﻿- Did he shoot someone? - I didn't ask. I don't know. ﻿He'll show up again someday. ﻿- Are you done? - No, not yet. ﻿Give me a bit more, will you? ﻿Halil's teacher called from school today. ﻿He sits on his own in break time. ﻿You think his friends leave him out? ﻿Why would they do that, Mukadder? ﻿It's normal at that age. ﻿The boy's alone. He's so alone. ﻿Why would he be alone, Mukadder? ﻿He's with us, isn't he? He has us. ﻿It's not like that. Being an only child is hard. ﻿If he had a brother or sister, he'd have company, huh? ﻿Wait. Wait a second. ﻿Where are you going ﻿To brush my teeth. ﻿You go to sleep. ﻿How did you know I was here? ﻿It doesn't take a psychic to find you here. ﻿Where else do you go? ﻿You want a raki? ﻿- No, thanks. Just tea. - Okay. ﻿Psst. ﻿- Have a glass, huh? - What? ﻿- Raki. - Get out of here! ﻿Go on, just one glass. ﻿Give me a break! ﻿Why aren't you home at this hour of night? ﻿Thank you. ﻿Speak for yourself. Why aren't you home? ﻿I mean, every night... You're better than that. ﻿Take a look at yourself. ﻿What's wrong with me? ﻿Isn't it tough on your wife being on her own every night? ﻿- Did she call Mukadder? - Uh-huh. ﻿- Really? - Yes. ﻿- Don't say a word to her. - Okay. ﻿- Or there'll be trouble. - Okay, okay! ﻿I told my dad the other day I was seeing you. ﻿And? ﻿His face fell. ﻿That's how he sees you. ﻿Wow. ﻿Uncle Ibrahim... ﻿It's because I drink. ﻿Rubbish. ﻿Sure, it's because I drink. ﻿You're talking rubbish. ﻿What you do isn't drinking. You've become a total alcoholic. ﻿Look, you can't be a Muslim through the sins of other people. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿He should look at his own past before opening his mouth. ﻿Don't be ridiculous. ﻿He swore off drinking after the accident and hasn't touched a drop since. ﻿Right, and that brought your mother back. ﻿How can you say that? He served his sentence, right? ﻿Six months. ﻿- Six months, man! - Kartal, for God's sake! ﻿He sees you as his own son. ﻿I see you as my brother. I'm telling you this for your own good. ﻿No one's telling you to pray five times a day. ﻿- Come on, let's go. - No. ﻿Psst. ﻿Did you go to the doctor? ﻿Yes. ﻿And? ﻿Any news? ﻿The guy didn't say a lot. ﻿He did tests and stuff. ﻿So we can't have kids. It's not going to happen. What can we do? ﻿Sometimes it's better not to have them. ﻿You shouldn't push it. Just let it go. ﻿Call it fate. ﻿God gives some people kids and not others. ﻿Slow down, you idiot! Slow down. ﻿I'm fine. Don't you know me? ﻿I'm okay! ﻿I'm okay. ﻿I'm doing great! ﻿Psst! ﻿Vural! ﻿Look the other way. ﻿I can't do it if you watch. Look the other way! ﻿You're just like a kid. ﻿Come on, there's nothing to see. ﻿I'm not called Eagle for nothing, man. I see everything. ﻿For God's sake ﻿- Come on. - I'm okay. ﻿Get moving then. ﻿You've fouled up the street. Move! ﻿- Give me a break, man! - Move, come on! ﻿I'm fine! ﻿Look at the mess you made. Come on. ﻿- Salaam alaikum. - Alaikum salaam. ﻿Take these to Nº 12 llkbahar St. Apt. 3. ﻿- Can I get a pack of Muratti? - Muratti. ﻿And don't forget the milk. ﻿- Vural! - Hey! ﻿Can you play backgammon yet? ﻿You bet. Come over tonight and I'll teach you. ﻿Okay! I'll stop by. ﻿Hey! Come when my dad isn't there. ﻿Okay. See you later! ﻿Didn't I give you the change? ﻿No, you didn't. ﻿But I put it right there. ﻿If you had, it would still be there. ﻿It's early, I guess I'm not all there. Sorry. ﻿Thanks! Have a good day. ﻿You, too. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Did you take the change? ﻿Don't make me search you. ﻿- Did you take it or not? - No. ﻿Swear you didn't. ﻿Why did you do it? ﻿Do you need the money? ﻿God sees what no one else does. ﻿Do you hear me? ﻿Right, you're going back. ﻿You pretend you found the money on the floor... and give it back to the shopkeeper. ﻿- Okay? - Okay. ﻿Swear you won't do it again. ﻿Swear! I swear. ﻿Okay, off you go. ﻿Okay. I'd say that's okay. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Chin down a little. ﻿- ﻿Bismillah. - I'll get it. Sorry. ﻿I've got it. ﻿Photon Color. ﻿I'm working. ﻿Yes. ﻿I have a customer. ﻿Okay, but I have work to do. ﻿Mahmut. Okay, I'll call you back. ﻿Okay, we'll figure it out. Don't worry. ﻿Okay. Thanks. ﻿Okay, bye. ﻿What are you doing? What's the matter with you? ﻿Why call when you know my dad's at the shop? ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿I send your calls to voice mail, then you call on the landline! ﻿What's wrong ﻿Okay, it's okay. ﻿Okay. ﻿Okay, I'm sorry. ﻿Come on, don't cry. ﻿Look at me. What's wrong? ﻿What is it? ﻿Huh? ﻿What's wrong ﻿Did someone hurt Huh? ﻿Look at me. ﻿Talk to me. Did someone hurt you? ﻿Huh? ﻿Did you go for your visa appointment? ﻿Did they turn you down? Is that it? ﻿Is that the problem? ﻿To hell with their visa! ﻿Why let it get to you? ﻿You have your own beautiful country. Stay here. ﻿I'm here for you. ﻿Don't do this to yourself. ﻿You can get a new job and start working again. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come on. ﻿It's okay, I'm here. ﻿I told my dad I needed five minutes. ﻿He's on his own at the shop. ﻿I have to go. Okay? ﻿Don't go. ﻿- Don't go, please. - But I have to. ﻿- Don't go. - Look, I really have to. ﻿- He's alone. I won't hear the end of it. - Please. ﻿- Don't do this. - Please don't go. ﻿- What are you doing? Stop it! - Please! ﻿Stop! ﻿You're really losing it! ﻿Get out! Don't ever come back! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Get out! Get out of here! ﻿- What's got into you? - Get out! ﻿Fine! Do what the hell you want! ﻿Put that down! What the hell are you doing? ﻿- Let go! - You let go! ﻿- Are you crazy? - Let me go! ﻿What the hell are you doing? ﻿- Are you out of your mind? - Let go! ﻿- Are you crazy? - Let me go! ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿Calm down! ﻿You've really lost it! ﻿Are you crazy? ﻿What the hell are you doing? Huh? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Get a grip on yourself. Get a grip! ﻿Don't make me crazy. ﻿Come here. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Look at me! ﻿Get a grip on yourself. ﻿I said calm down! Calm down! ﻿Are you going to kill yourself over a visa you didn't get? ﻿How ridiculous is that? ﻿Is your life that worthless? ﻿Are you crazy? Huh? ﻿Look at me. Now get a grip on yourself. Okay? ﻿Calm down. ﻿There's nothing in life that can't be fixed. You understand? ﻿I'm pregnant! ﻿What do you mean? ﻿You're pregnant? ﻿I went to the doctor. ﻿And? ﻿It's 11 weeks. ﻿Eleven weeks? ﻿Is it mine? ﻿Is it mine? ﻿Huh? ﻿Yes, it's yours. ﻿Swear on it. ﻿Swear on it! ﻿I swear! ﻿Calm down. Okay? ﻿We'll figure this out. ﻿Is that the problem? ﻿I'm here. ﻿We'll find a way. We'll get a termination. ﻿We can't. ﻿What do you mean "we can't"? ﻿The doctor said you can't after eight weeks. It's illegal. ﻿How can it be illegal? ﻿Didn't you realize until now? ﻿I don't get it. Anyway, he's not the only doctor around. ﻿If he won't do it, another one will. And it'll all be okay. ﻿It's too late now. ﻿What's too late? ﻿You have to talk to your family. ﻿What do you mean? I can't talk to anyone. ﻿What am I supposed to do? ﻿Tell them everything. I'm sick of this whole thing! ﻿Sonay, what are you talking about? ﻿- Vural, if you don't tell them, I will. - You can't. ﻿- I'll go to the shop and tell... - You can't. your dad everything! ﻿Don't be ridiculous! You're not going anywhere! ﻿- I'll tell him everything. - You can't. ﻿- I'm going right now! - Where are you going? ﻿Let me go! I'm going! ﻿Sonay! Look at me! ﻿Get a grip on yourself! ﻿Get a grip. ﻿Okay. ﻿God damn it. Okay. I'll do it. ﻿I'll talk to my dad. ﻿I promise. ﻿Okay? ﻿I'll tell him everything. ﻿I'll tell him we've been in love for months. ﻿And then I'll talk to Mukadder. ﻿I'll tell her everything. ﻿I'll talk to them. ﻿I'll say this is the way it has to be. ﻿I'll say there's no other way. ﻿I'll say it's fate. ﻿I rang the doorbell, but no one answered. ﻿You seriously didn't hear it? ﻿There was a loud bang. ﻿Something must have crashed on the floor. It was probably that. ﻿Come on, come here. ﻿I'll just get the towels. ﻿Father's asking if you're going to eat. ﻿No. You go ahead. ﻿Have you lost your appetite? ﻿No, I don't feel like eating right now. You go ahead. ﻿Shall I make you a herbal tea? It'll settle your stomach. ﻿You go ahead and eat. ﻿If I rest a little, I'll feel better. ﻿Okay. ﻿You look terrible, I tell you. ﻿I think I'm getting sick. ﻿Really? So dress warmer! ﻿Everyone keeps saying it's going to snow and it never does. ﻿It's this biting cold. ﻿It goes right through you. ﻿It's enough to give you pneumonia. ﻿I want to say something. I was with you midday yesterday, okay? ﻿In case my dad asks. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Nothing. You know my dad. ﻿He never stops asking questions. ﻿I told him I was with you. ﻿Fine, okay. ﻿You really got into fishing, huh? ﻿What else is there to do, for God's sake? I don't know. I mean, doing it week in week out. ﻿Don't you get bored? ﻿No. It passes the time. ﻿There's this girl who marries a ﻿Soon the guy gets into drinking. Okay? ﻿Sounds familiar. ﻿I'm telling you a story, man! ﻿Okay, go on. ﻿For God's sake. ﻿- Hey, okay. Keep going! - Okay! ﻿Anyway, the guy gets into drinking. ﻿So the girl tells her father-in-law the guy's drinking and ignoring her. ﻿The father-in-law says, "It's a passing thing. Just give it time." ﻿Turns out he's right and it passes. ﻿Then the guy starts chasing other women. ﻿She goes back to the guy's father and says he's into other women. ﻿And the father-in-law says, "It's just another passing thing." ﻿Turns out he's right again. ﻿This time he starts gambling. ﻿So the wife goes back to the father-in-law. ﻿And the father-in-law sings the same tune. ﻿But he's right again! ﻿And then the guy starts fishing. ﻿So the girl goes to his father and says, "He's started fishing now. What do I do?" ﻿And the father-in-law says, "Now you're in shit. It'll never pass." ﻿Fuck you! ﻿Did I tell it that badly? ﻿No, standard for you. ﻿I'm just passing the time here. ﻿The fisherman and the fish face the same story. ﻿They both die in the end. ﻿A woman killed herself in the neighborhood. ﻿- Really? - Yeah. ﻿How do you mean? ﻿Just that. She committed suicide. ﻿- Really? - Yeah. ﻿The gossip started right away. ﻿The girl was a whore, her lover killed her... All that shit. ﻿What goes around comes around. Mind your own business! ﻿Turns out she was a decent girl, cleaning people's houses and stuff. ﻿But you know our neighborhood. ﻿I know someone from the same building. She told me about it. ﻿You know Talih Street? It's right there. ﻿Who's that? ﻿Who's who? ﻿Who's this "someone"? ﻿Just someone I know. ﻿What does it matter? You wouldn't know her. ﻿Anyway, she hears the gunshot. ﻿She goes downstairs, rings the doorbell. ﻿No one answers. ﻿A few hours later she goes back down. ﻿She rings the doorbell again. Still no answer. So she gets suspicious and calls the police. ﻿Calls the police? ﻿Yeah, she calls the cops. ﻿When the cops come, they break down the door. ﻿The girl's brains are all over the place. ﻿This happens two blocks away! ﻿Vural, can you imagine? ﻿Who knows what her problem was? ﻿So it was suicide, right? ﻿Yeah, suicide. A bullet in her head. ﻿Come here! ﻿What's going on? I don't know what to do! ﻿Hold it! Just hold it! ﻿Aha! Here it comes. Hold it. ﻿Got it. - Hold it, man! - I am! ﻿Bring it over! Look at the beauty! ﻿- Look at him! - Watch out! ﻿It's okay. ﻿Come to daddy! ﻿Hang on! ﻿How can I help? ﻿- Hello. - Hello. ﻿We're from the homicide department. ﻿We have a few questions to ask. ﻿I hope nothing's wrong. ﻿They say we should drink it without sugar. ﻿But you know... ﻿It's supposed to be so bad for you. ﻿I'm not allowed it in anything. ﻿But I've got used to it in time. ﻿I have a sister. She's a little chubby. ﻿She's just had a baby. A cute little girl. ﻿God bless them. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Anyway, she goes to the dietician. ﻿She says no matter what she tries, she can't seem to lose weight. ﻿So the doctor asks if she eats a lot of bread. ﻿No! ﻿Does she have a sweet tooth? ﻿No! ﻿Does she go for pastries? No! ﻿Whatever the doctor asks, she says no! ﻿Then the doctor asks how many cups of tea she drinks a day. ﻿She says around 13-14 cups ﻿So he asks how many sugars she has in each cup. ﻿She says three. ﻿And the doctor has his diagnosis! He figures it out right there! ﻿I mean, do the math. ﻿That makes 40 sugars a day! ﻿Can you imagine? ﻿We go through 40 sugars a day without even realizing. Like a horse! ﻿There you go. ﻿Right, we don't want to take up too much of your time. ﻿A woman was killed a few blocks away. ﻿Talih Street, chief. ﻿Who was she? ﻿A young woman. ﻿How did it happen? ﻿How was she killed? Someone shot her. Have you heard about it? ﻿Well, I... ﻿I heard there was a suicide, not a murder, but... ﻿No, we don't think it was suicide. ﻿How come? ﻿We have our reasons. ﻿We found blood stains in the bathroom. ﻿Whose blood? ﻿Dad, stop asking questions all the time. The guys are working on an investigation. ﻿I was just curious, son! What's wrong? ﻿The blood of the deceased. ﻿And someone had tried to clean it off. But anyway. ﻿It wasn't a break-in, was it, chief? ﻿No. ﻿Forgive me. It wasn't a prostitution thing, was it? ﻿Why do you say that? ﻿Well, a young woman living alone. ﻿Maybe she had a man in? ﻿Dad! That's really shameful. ﻿Son, if you knew the things I hear! ﻿There's no decency left in the neighborhood. ﻿No, she wasn't a prostitute. ﻿She was a decent woman working to make a living. ﻿If that's the case, God rest her soul. ﻿Amen. ﻿Her name was Sonay Cevriye. Do you know her? ﻿- Cebriye, chief. - Huh? ﻿Cebriye, with a "b". ﻿What kind of name is that? It has to be Cevriye. ﻿I checked her ID, chief. It's Cebriye, with a "b". ﻿Well, I'll be damned! ﻿They must have written it wrong on her birth certificate. ﻿Whatever, Cebriye. ﻿Do you know her? ﻿No, I've never heard of her. ﻿You? ﻿It's the first time I've heard the name. ﻿The week she was killed... she applied for a visa. At the consulate here. ﻿Is it the consulate or embassy? ﻿I think the embassy is in Ankara. The con... ﻿Chief, if it was a visa, she'd go to the consulate here. ﻿Well, she made the application there. ﻿We found the photos in her home. ﻿They were taken in this shop. ﻿You mean we took the photos? ﻿Yes. ﻿Here you go. ﻿The thing is, we have so many people coming in and out every day. ﻿I don't remember her right off. ﻿Let me take a look. ﻿Yes, it's, you know... ﻿The girl whose photo they didn't like at the consulate. ﻿- Then she came back. - Oh, right! ﻿- You took another one. - Okay, I remember now. ﻿There was the thing with her ears. ﻿Her ears didn't show. She asked for a retake. ﻿Now I remember. ﻿So it was this girl, huh? Shame. ﻿- It was Friday, right? - Yes. ﻿How did you know right away it was Friday? ﻿It was Friday two weeks ago. ﻿My dad and I went to Friday prayers. That's why I remember. ﻿- Right, dad? - Yes. ﻿Did you notice anything unusual? ﻿About the woman? ﻿No. She seemed normal, right? ﻿Yes. ﻿Was she alone? Was anyone with her? ﻿No, she was alone. ﻿Yes. ﻿Was anyone waiting outside? ﻿I didn't see anyone. ﻿Someone in a brown... ﻿Light brown. ﻿Someone in a light brown coat. ﻿Light brown? ﻿No. ﻿How long was she here? ﻿Not long. ﻿She had the photo taken and left. ﻿When you say "not long"? ﻿I mean hardly any time. ﻿It must have been five-six minutes at most. ﻿Right, I see. ﻿We've taken up your time. Thank you. ﻿- No problem. - Not at all. ﻿Thanks for the tea. ﻿You're welcome. ﻿- The tea was five-star. - Right, boss? ﻿We're sick of stale office tea. ﻿You're always welcome, chief. ﻿Call by whenever you have time. ﻿What kind of name is Cebriye? ﻿Cebriye with a "b". I agree, it has to be wrong. ﻿Sorry. ﻿I feel so... ﻿The woman downstairs... ﻿I heard the bang! ﻿I saw the guy outside! ﻿What a life! ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Shh. It's okay, don't be crazy. ﻿Come here. ﻿Why do you keep coming all the time? ﻿Who gets a massage every day? ﻿Ceylan. ﻿Come here. ﻿Yes, all the paperwork was fine. ﻿I don't know why. ﻿Where are you now? I'm coming over. ﻿I'm freezing. Really freezing. ﻿It's so damn cold. ﻿We're almost out of firewood at home. ﻿swear to God we'll freeze. ﻿I'll take care of it, dad. Don't worry. ﻿Like the cracks in the wall, huh? ﻿It upsets me whenever I see them. ﻿I talked to a friend. We'll fix it. ﻿We'll do it together, don't worry. ﻿I can see I'll end up doing it myself. ﻿What's that there? ﻿What? ﻿There's a bag here. ﻿- What bag, son? - A woman's bag, dad. ﻿There was a girl on the phone there. She went that way. ﻿You think it's hers? ﻿That's so strange. ﻿Look, here's her wallet. ﻿Let me see. ﻿Here's her ID, dad. ﻿Take a look. ﻿It says "Nurgül Seyhan" ﻿- Ha, that's her. - Who? ﻿She'd come for a visa. She left her phone with us. ﻿She picked up the phone just now. ﻿It's her. ﻿What's this? ﻿Whoa! ﻿These people have their head in the clouds. ﻿Put it back and let's lock it in the cupboard. ﻿They'll pick it up sooner or later. ﻿Maybe they won't, dad. ﻿There's enough cash here to see us through two winters. ﻿Don't even think about it, son! ﻿That money isn't rightfully ours. ﻿God sees what no one else does. ﻿I always take refuge in God, dad. ﻿It was a joke. ﻿Don't. Don't make jokes like that. ﻿They begin as a joke and then stick in your mind. ﻿Whatever. ﻿You take it. Put it in the cupboard. ﻿We'll give it back when she turns up. ﻿If she doesn't, we'll take it to the police station. ﻿They can trace her from the ID. ﻿Right, Vural Beyaz. Is there anything you want to tell me? ﻿Well. ﻿No. ﻿Like what? ﻿Where were you that day? ﻿What day? ﻿You know what day. ﻿No, I don't. ﻿Sure! How would you know? ﻿Dumb question! ﻿We talked about it, remember? ﻿A woman was killed in your area. ﻿What was the name? Sonay... Cebriye. ﻿I'm asking about that day. Where were you the day she was killed? ﻿Chief, are you trying to... ﻿Are you implying that I... ﻿Relax! We're just talking here. ﻿Now answer the question. ﻿Well, when you ask all at once... I don't remember exactly. ﻿What day was it again? ﻿Wednesday, February 6th. ﻿Where else would I be? At the shop. ﻿How do you know it happened during the day? ﻿Well, you mentioned the day it happened so I assumed it was during the day. ﻿Did it happen at night? ﻿No, during the day. The middle of the day. ﻿Around 1.30 p.m. ﻿The neighbor upstairs heard a gunshot. ﻿But you weren't at the shop that day. Vural. ﻿Huh? A delivery arrived that day. ﻿Something you ordered. ﻿A memory card for the camera. ﻿Your dad took the delivery. ﻿My dad always takes the deliveries. That's his job. ﻿But we spoke to your dad. He said you weren't at the shop in the middle of the day. ﻿Wednesday. ﻿Look, Vural. Let me tell you something. ﻿The way things stand right now, you can't afford not to remember. ﻿Okay? ﻿- You understand? - Yes. ﻿Okay. ﻿Wednesday, February 6th. I... ﻿I went to see a friend that day. ﻿I went over to a friend for lunch. ﻿- A friend. - Exactly. ﻿Who is this friend? What's their name? ﻿Kartal. ﻿Kartal. Does he have a surname? Gezenoğlu. ﻿Kartal Gezenoğlu. Gezenoğlu. ﻿Right. ﻿How do you know this Gezenoğlu? ﻿From the neighborhood. We grew up together. ﻿Where will we find him? ﻿He works at the consulate. ﻿He's a cleaner there. ﻿Okay, I get the picture. ﻿I don't understand, chief. What picture? What's going on? ﻿You told us you didn't know the woman. ﻿But she called you 15 times that week. ﻿Your number is on the call log. You didn't say. ﻿Look, chief. That girl... ﻿I mean, I took her photos. ﻿Her passport photo. ﻿Then the consulate didn't like it. Her ears didn't show or something. ﻿She called me to ask if we could do another photo. ﻿So I said of course we could. I took the photo and that was it. ﻿- On your cell phone? - Yes, I gave her my number. ﻿Vural! ﻿Did you kill the woman? ﻿What are you talking about, chief? How could I... ﻿So what did you talk about? Huh? ﻿Her ears not showing in the photo? ﻿No. Look, let me explain, chief. The girl called me. ﻿She called again and again on my cell phone. ﻿I told her not to call. ﻿I told her I was married, but she kept calling. ﻿I rejected all her calls. Then she started calling the shop. ﻿You see what I'm saying? I mean, she had this thing for me. ﻿She called one day. ﻿She said she was going to hang herself or jump off some place... and kill herself. ﻿I pleaded with her. I said, "Don't do it. It's all wrong." ﻿I explained that it was a sin to take her own life. ﻿I mean, I did my duty as... ﻿Then why say you didn't know her back in the shop? ﻿Chief, how could I talk about it in front of my dad? ﻿The man has a heart condition. I'm married. ﻿I couldn't have told you... ﻿If you weren't having an affair with the woman... ﻿what was there to be afraid of? ﻿It's not that simple, chief. You don't know my dad. ﻿You don't know my wife, Mukadder, you don't know the neighborhood. ﻿Believe me, if anything gets out, there's no way you can stop the gossip. ﻿And the mud sticks, you know? ﻿How did you meet this Sonay? ﻿She... ﻿She came to the shop seven-eight months ago. ﻿With her mother. ﻿To buy a photo frame. ﻿Her mother has died since, God rest her soul. ﻿That's how we met. ﻿Then she started calling me. So I said... ﻿I said I was married, I had a family, and there was no way... ﻿So you didn't show any interest. ﻿No. ﻿- And nothing happened between you. - No. ﻿But she wouldn't leave you alone. Is that right? ﻿Yes, chief. ﻿Right. Okay, Vural. ﻿So let's ask Kartal if you were really with him or not. ﻿Right? ﻿Okay. ﻿Then I guess I'll go. Can I go? ﻿Where are you going? Relax, have a tea. ﻿Sure, but my dad is on his own at the shop. I should... ﻿He can manage for another day, don't worry. ﻿We've got business with you. Huh? ﻿But wait, forget the tea. ﻿Have a tangerine. These are something else. ﻿Tangerines from Manavgat. Here you go. ﻿Fuck. ﻿Kartal. ﻿Come down to security. Some guys are asking for you. ﻿The ballistic report on the gun has come in. ﻿Do you know someone called Bekir Ugur? ﻿No. ﻿I don't. ﻿Why? ﻿So you've never heard of him? ﻿No. ﻿Who is he? ﻿Okay, you can go. ﻿Vural. ﻿Don't disappear anywhere. ﻿We'll need to talk when the autopsy results come in. ﻿I was worried all day. ﻿Why did they keep you in so long? ﻿They didn't keep me in. ﻿The guy must feel some kind of connection with us. ﻿That's the reason. ﻿In fact, he sent you his regards. Remember the chief? ﻿Send mine back. ﻿What did they ask? ﻿If I know this or that person from the neighborhood... ﻿...what those people are like. ﻿The guy's trying to crack the case. ﻿- Dad. - Yes? ﻿When did you talk to the guys? ﻿What guys? ﻿The police. ﻿They came to the shop that once, son. You were there, remember? ﻿Why do you ask? ﻿No reason. ﻿They just acted like you'd spoken again. ﻿No. I haven't spoken to anyone. ﻿So they really killed that woman, huh? ﻿That's what they say. ﻿And the chief said she was a decent working woman. ﻿God damn whoever did it! What else can I say? ﻿Amen. ﻿I've missed seeing white. ﻿I wish it would snow... ﻿and cover the whole place. ﻿You think... ﻿it would cover up our sins as well? ﻿Kartal, if you keep up this drunken ramble, forget it, I'm going. ﻿You said you had something to talk about. ﻿A new coat, huh? ﻿No, I already had it. ﻿- Really? - Yes. ﻿I've never seen it before. ﻿How much have you had to drink? ﻿Forget that. You said something the other day. ﻿What? ﻿You said if your dad asked about you... I should keep my mouth shut. I should say you were with me. ﻿- Huh? - Uh-huh. ﻿Well, your dad didn't ask. ﻿The police did. ﻿Well? ﻿I called by at the shop in my lunch break. ﻿You weren't there. ﻿Mahmut said you'd left with the cops. ﻿Then they turned up at the consulate. ﻿They asked a ton of questions. ﻿Where was I the day the girl was killed, who was I with, what was I doing? ﻿And? ﻿I said I was with you. What else would I tell them? ﻿Good. ﻿Where were you that day anyway? ﻿At home. ﻿Where else would I be? ﻿Talk to me! What are you staring at? ﻿Talk about what? What's wrong with you? ﻿Why did the cops take you in? ﻿Look, it's nothing. ﻿- That girl. - Yes? ﻿She came to our shop to get a photo taken. ﻿- Really? - Sure. ﻿So they asked me about it. That's all. ﻿You're being shifty, I know you! ﻿You said you were with me. That's why they came to find me. ﻿What are you talking about? Why would I be shifty with you? ﻿Vural! ﻿Look, that day. ﻿I was with a girl. ﻿From another neighborhood. ﻿I told my dad I was with you. ﻿So when the police asked where I was in front of my dad... I had to tell them the same thing. ﻿That's it. ﻿- When was that? - That day. ﻿Which day? ﻿- The day the police came to the shop. - Okay. ﻿That day. ﻿Man... ﻿Look, what don't you understand? Just drop it, will you? ﻿I've told you everything. Enough is enough. ﻿You're like a broken record. ﻿For God's sake... ﻿Listen, you know what? ﻿I'm thinking of going to America. How do I get there? ﻿As a tourist. ﻿You walk! ﻿All we need is you being a tourist. Why would they give you a visa? ﻿- Won't they? - No! ﻿Can't you do something? Don't you know anyone? ﻿I know a few officials. ﻿But it's not that easy. ﻿Anyway, why the hell do you want to go to America? ﻿What's it to you? I'm just going. So tell me how it works. ﻿You have any property in your name? ﻿Yes, some land in the village. ﻿Any money in the bank? ﻿- No. - No? ﻿They want land, they want bricks and mortar. ﻿They want money in the bank, security. ﻿How are you going to fix that? ﻿Clear that hurdle and you can waltz into America. Great! ﻿Do you have money? ﻿When will the US pull out of Syria ﻿Let's see the famous double-slit experiment and how it demystifies particle-wave duality. ﻿To perform the experiment let's make two slits in the top of a box. ﻿Salaam alaikum. ﻿Alaikum salaam, dad. ﻿You left early. ﻿I couldn't sleep. ﻿So I went to the mosque for dawn prayers. ﻿May God accept your prayers. ﻿Amen. And everyone's. ﻿I imagined there was work to do. ﻿Remember you said no one can get in the way of destiny? ﻿Yes? ﻿That no one can stop a person dying if their time has come. ﻿And that no one departs this world if their time hasn't come. ﻿You said it was God's will. ﻿That's right, son. ﻿What's up? ﻿Nothing. ﻿But say you're walking down the street. ﻿And then a car hits you. ﻿Who's the arbiter of death? Is it the driver? ﻿Or God? ﻿I mean, is the driver... just God's driver? ﻿Are you referring to someone? ﻿No, not at all. ﻿Say someone's time has come. ﻿Is the arbiter of death guilty? ﻿It's all God's will. ﻿Now drop the subject. ﻿And don't bring it up again. ﻿Your father came here years ago. ﻿Right after losing your mother. ﻿Like you, he asked if the door to repentance was open. ﻿God sees everything. He watches everything we do. ﻿He punishes sins... but never closes the door to repentance. ﻿The door to repentance is always open. ﻿What's the purpose of your visit? ﻿Tourism. ﻿My son's phone is turned off. ﻿Why don't you have a seat? He'll be back soon. ﻿There was an envelope inside the bag. ﻿It had some money inside. ﻿My son... ﻿My son found the bag there. ﻿We took the lady's bag and locked it in the cupboard. ﻿I swear to God, we wouldn't do wrong. ﻿Leave God out of this. ﻿Where is your son? ﻿What are you trying to say? ﻿I'm saying that money isn't rightfully yours. ﻿Look, son. I've been in business for 40 years. ﻿Every cent I've made has been rightfully earned. ﻿- You have no shame, do you? - Honey! ﻿You'll have the police to deal with, I warn you. ﻿You want to call the police? Go ahead! ﻿Go on, call them! Make the call! ﻿Don't yell at me! ﻿Get out! ﻿You thief! ﻿- Get out! - Fuck you! Asshole! ﻿Get out of my shop! ﻿You're all thieves! ﻿It's okay, Adem. Calm down. ﻿I'm your father's age! ﻿- What's up, uncle Ibrahim? - He called me an asshole! ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿Adem, what are you doing? ﻿Fucking thief! ﻿- Mahmut, what's going on? - Vural! ﻿We had a row with a guy in the shop. The dickhead smashed the door. ﻿Uncle Ibrahim passed out. ﻿- Where? - Here in the shop. ﻿He called uncle Ibrahim a thief. ﻿No, I mean where is he now? ﻿An ambulance took him to the hospital. You know the hospital up there? ﻿Vural! ﻿What's going on here? ﻿My dad got into a fight with a guy. He passed out and was taken to hospital. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to see him. Vural! ﻿Vural, you're coming with us. ﻿- How come? - We're going to forensics. ﻿For a test. ﻿- What test? - A blood test ﻿Why? ﻿Okay. ﻿First let me tell my family. ﻿And we'll go see my dad. ﻿Then I'll go wherever you want, chief. ﻿Is no one saying anything? ﻿No. What would they say? What can they say anyway? ﻿He's in intensive care. ﻿They say we have to wait. ﻿Oh, God. God help us. ﻿I have to go. ﻿The window is broken and I have to close up the shop. ﻿Mahmut has been waiting there for hours. ﻿Tell Mahmut to close up. ﻿He can't. I mean, he doesn't... ﻿- Why not? - Well... He doesn't have the keys. ﻿He doesn't have the padlock. He doesn't know how to close the shutters. ﻿What am I supposed to do here on my own? ﻿Halil. Come with me, son. ﻿Come here. ﻿Look at me. ﻿I'm leaving now. ﻿But I'll be back later. ﻿Okay? ﻿Okay. ﻿I want you to look after your mom. ﻿Be a good boy for her. ﻿Stay with her all the time, okay? ﻿That's a good boy. ﻿That's a good boy. ﻿Off you go now. ﻿Go sit with your mom. Go on. ﻿- Is this the place? - Yes, that's what Mahmut said. ﻿I'll go in and see. But you know what? ﻿You don't mind staying here, do you? ﻿Okay. I'll be waiting just there. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Vural! ﻿Hey! ﻿Hey, Vural! ﻿I don't get it. ﻿Take a seat over there. ﻿We'll be keeping you until the results come back. ﻿Vural. ﻿Is there anything you want to say? ﻿Chief. ﻿Can I pray? ﻿The baby isn't yours. You can go. ﻿I see. ﻿They're paying for the broken window. ﻿And you've returned the money. ﻿So why are you still pressing charges? ﻿- They're paying for the window, huh? - That's right. ﻿They pay for the window and that's the end of it, huh? ﻿Look, my dad's in intensive care. ﻿I can't be with him because of all this. ﻿I don't even know if he'll make it. ﻿Okay, but how was the guy to know you took the money home? ﻿That's my point. I keep it safe at home, not knowing where the hell it came from. ﻿I don't touch a cent, and that's what I get for it! ﻿You're right about that. ﻿What would the guy have done if I'd said the money was gone? ﻿- It doesn't work like that. - He attacked my dad! ﻿- You're right, but... - He tried to beat up an old man! ﻿- It's outrageous! - Just listen, will you? ﻿My dad's life is in danger. For a few bucks? Isn't his life worth more than that? ﻿There were no blows. They just pushed each other. ﻿You should have told your dad you'd taken the money home. ﻿If you ask me, you won't get anything out of this. ﻿But if you still want to file charges... ﻿here's the petition. Go ahead and sign. ﻿The stone he threw... smashed the window and then hit the wall. It cracked the plaster. ﻿He should pay for that, too. ﻿Good luck with that. ﻿Thanks. ﻿- Sorry about what happened to your dad. - Thanks. ﻿But looks like he's doing well. What a warrior! ﻿Yes, he's doing okay. ﻿- Aren't you cold like that? - No. ﻿You go inside. Put the heater on, make some tea. ﻿Mukadder will look after you. I'll be right there. ﻿No, I've already seen them. ﻿I wanted to check on you. ﻿Fine. ﻿Are you just going to stand there? ﻿Vural, I need to tell you something. ﻿Go on. ﻿You know the girl who was killed? Who came to your shop? ﻿Turns out it was... her lover who did it. ﻿The cops took him in. ﻿The police chief came by. ﻿Ekrem. He told me. ﻿- Really? - Yes. He broke the news. ﻿Is that what you were going to say? ﻿No. There's something else. ﻿There's someone I'm seeing. ﻿I mean, there's someone in my life. ﻿I've been seeing her for a while. ﻿Ceylan. ﻿You never said. ﻿I was going to. But anyway, that's not the issue. ﻿Ceylan lives in the same building as the girl who was killed. ﻿So that's explains the "friend" you said you had in the building, huh? ﻿I was there when she heard the gunshot. ﻿At first, I said, "It's not a gunshot. Something must have fallen on the floor." ﻿Turns out it was actually a gunshot. ﻿She went down and rang the doorbell. No one answered. ﻿Then she looks out the window and sees a guy leaving the building. ﻿Vural, you had a light brown coat. What happened to it? ﻿What are you talking about? Huh? ﻿I haven't seen you wear it in a while. ﻿On my way to the hospital that day, you got in a police car and drove off. ﻿I'd just heard what had happened. ﻿Ceylan was with me. ﻿She recognized you. ﻿She said you were the guy she saw. ﻿What the hell are you talking about? Huh? ﻿Was it you who killed the girl? ﻿No. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Vural. ﻿Swear on the Quran you didn't do it. ﻿I swear. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Are you done? ﻿No, not yet. ﻿Give me a bit more, will you?
