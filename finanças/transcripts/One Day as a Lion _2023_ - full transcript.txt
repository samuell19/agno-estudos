They told me, but I had no idea. Lulu? It's Lola. Well, who gives a shit? I'm paying you to sit down? There's no one here. Oh, you want to be a smart ass. Get up. Come on, sweetheart. Get to work. Time's money. Get back there and batter them calf fries. When you're done with that, wrap some silverware. Plenty of work to do. Gotta tell you goddamn kids everything. What the fuck? Jesus Christ. - Is it done? - No, it's not done. The guy just pulled up on a fucking horse. - So? - So you can't kill a guy on a horse! Well, is he still on the horse? No, he just went inside the place. Great. Problem solved. Think about your kid, do what you gotta do, and call me when it's done. Look, Dom, hold on. No, Dom. Hello? Dom? Fuck! Ahem. - First day, darling? - Yes, sir. - What happened to Flo? - Flo passed. Poor Flo. Thirteen years been with me. - Lulu... - Still Lola. Coffee for Mr. Boggs, if you're not too busy. Make it quick. All right. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you, ma'am. Would it be okay if I use the bathroom? Some piece of tail, huh? I think that girl belongs to The Black Widow. Come again? Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Can I help you? Look, I don't want to hurt you, Walter. Okay? Excuse me? You owe Pauly Russo a lot of money. And you are? Uh, um... I work... Well, I don't work for Pauly. I know Dom really well, and he works for Pauly. Do you know Dom? It doesn't matter. Look, I don't want to do this. I really don't, okay? So if you could just pay Pauly the money that you owe him... If you could just do that, everything will be cool and no one has to get killed or anything crazy like that, okay? Coffee? He's not staying. Okay. What do you say, Walter? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Hey! You! Is that guy dead? - Would you like me to check? - Yes, please. - Looks pretty dead. - Oh, shit. What? What shit? You gotta come with me. I'm really sorry but you gotta come with me. - What? - You heard me. Come on, now. Go. Fuck. Come on. Lola. What'd you just say to me? What'd you just say to me? - My name. - Your name? Give me the keys. Where the fuck... I got the keys. Give me your phone. - Why? - Because I have a gun and I said so. That's why. Give me your fucking phone. Now. Now. Now. Why did you do that? Stop asking me questions. Do what you're told. Don't move, okay? Stay put. You hear me? Nod your head. Stay put. Okay? It's not fucking funny. Please, come on, come on, come on. - Are we good? - I fucked up, Dom. Jesus Christ, Jackie. What did you do? - He got away. - How is that possible? - You guys didn't tell me that he'd have a gun. - What difference does it make? What difference does it make? What kind of a question is that? Guns kill people, Dom. You see this, Jackie? This! - This is why I don't stand up for you. - I'm sorry. Stand up for me? Yeah, you come to me, "I have a problem. I need help." Every fucking time, it's an unmitigated disaster. Fuck you. When did I ever ask you for shit? Twenty-five fucking years, I ask you for something? Yes, actually. You did. All you had to do is take a dive in the second round. What do you do? You fucking knock the guy out in the second round! Okay. All right, all right. That guy was a bum, okay? He was a bum, and I barely touched him. That was very long time ago. Jackie, I'm done fucking with you. Just tell me what happened. - I think I killed the cook. - The who? I-I might have accidentally mentioned Pauly's name to the cowboy guy before he got away. Jackie, where are you right now? Where are you right fucking now? Jackie? Jackie? Fuck. Lola? Fuck! Fuck. Stop! Fucking stop! I'm not gonna fucking hit you back, now stop! - Fuck you! - Stop. Fuck you! Fuck! Stop! Fuck! Draw. Fucking stop! - Okay? No more running. - Fine. Do you promise? You might be the worst criminal in the history of the sport. - I am not a criminal. - Clearly. I'm not. I swear to God, this isn't me. I only agreed to kill that guy Walter because my kid's in jail. I need the money to get him a lawyer. You agreed to kill someone so that your kid could have a lawyer? Yeah. Are you stupid? Welcome to the jungle, motherfuckers. You don't eat. You don't sleep. You can't even shit without my permission. I don't give a fuck if your eyes pop out and your face turns red. But you don't have to worry about that, do you... chocolate drop? Who'd you sell crack to? Your sister? Your aunt? Your baby mama? I bet you think you and me are the same. Best believe I'll bust your black ass just as quick as I'd bust that white bread cracker standing next to you. And who the fuck are you supposed to be? What's your fucking name? Billy Powers. Billy Powers... Welcome to the jungle, motherfucker. What the fuck are you telling me right now? - I'm not really sure, Pauly. - Why is that? I guess because I'm short on information. - You're short? - On information, yeah. Well, I need you not to be, Dom. I can't even fucking repeat that. I'll find out what happened. Well, that's good. That's really fucking good. - Yeah. - This? - Not good, Dom. - I know that. Well, it's good you fucking know. That's good. I hope you also know that this is on you. This is your fucking fault. Go. Go fucking take care of it. You give me fucking agita. Sorry, was that cook a friend of yours? What happened? If it's okay with you, maybe we can skip the pleasantries. I've been kidnapped, I'm walking back to the car. Let's just leave it at that. You don't have to put your hands up. That's great. - This is obviously an awkward situation. - Yes. Well, I figured maybe if I knew a thing or two about you, - it wouldn't have to be-- Right. - It won't be awkward. Okay. I'm Lola. I've said that already. I moved to Costa Rica a few years ago to open an acting school because living here reminded me of two things... failure and trauma. Anything else? You, uh-- You opened an acting school in Costa Rica? - It didn't work out. - That's shocking. I'm sorry about all this. Okay. Wasn't your car right here? Fuck, I give up. Just fuck it all, man! Just fucking... fuck! Are you fucking crying? - I'm really not a criminal. - Yeah. - I'm getting that. - I'm trying to do right by my son. That's all I'm trying to do. This poor fucking kid never had a chance. You think I'm an asshole? You should meet his mother. If you want to run now, or walk, or whatever, I'm not gonna hold it against you, so you can go ahead. Well, are you just gonna sit there? No, I'm either currently wanted for murder, or I'm... Yeah, I'm gonna be murdered by the guys who hired me to murder the guy I did not murder. So, yeah, sitting here seems-- seems like the move. You got any better ideas? I'll take any suggestions. Maybe I can help you. - Are you fucking with me? - No, I wouldn't do that. You're a big scary man with a gun. Also, pretty sure you're out of bullets. Why would you help me? Maybe we can help each other. I should have my fucking head examined for trusting this idiot again. - It's my fault. - No, no, no, no. It's my fault. It was your fault 10 years ago, when you told me he'd throw the fucking fight. It's my fault for listening the second time, okay? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... It's just that we grew up together. He used to be a smart fuck. - I don't know what happened. - I just said it was my fault. You want to get me hot? Yeah, but you said it was your fault for listening to me, which kind of makes it my fault if you think about it. I don't want to fucking think about it. That's what I'm saying, Dom, okay? Now you want to get me fucking hot? You want to get me fucking hot, or you want to let it go? - Fine. - Thank you, that is fine. Thank you. Now tomorrow, first thing, I want you to go and see that fucking degenerate cowboy and see if you can straighten this fucking out, all right? Who knows? Maybe it's all for the best. - You did the right thing. - What? You did the right thing, I'm saying, having the guy clipped. He owed you 100 grand for six weeks. You did the right thing. Are you being a fucking wise ass right now? - Are you fucking with me, Dom? - What do you mean? What do I mean? What do you mean, what the fuck do I mean? It didn't fucking work. It didn't work. What do you mean, "I had him clipped"? - I'm just saying. - Don't say. I don't want you to fucking say, all right? Do! I don't want you to fucking say. In retrospect, I would like to have my hundred stacks, - if that's okay with you. - I got it. Good. Now, tomorrow first thing, you go out there and you take care of this fucking thing with this cowboy. Hopefully, with some success, and then I want you to find that fucking cunt Jackie and I want you to bring him to me directly. Are we fucking clear? - Yeah, yeah. We're clear. - Yeah, yeah. What the fuck is going on with you? What's happening? What's happening? What the fuck are you doing? - What are you doing? - Why are you hiding? No one knows that I work at that fucking diner. - I'm being fucking discreet. - Oh, discreet! And pertaining to the others of concern, one's dead and for all we know, the other might have killed him, okay? - Shh! - Just relax. Oh, don't shush me! This is my fucking neighborhood, okay? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. By the way, speaking of your fucking neighborhood, what were you doing working at that shithole? - You're clearly rich. - No, no, no. This is my mom's house. She's rich. Truth be told, her ex-husbands are rich. - She's just lucky. - Uh-huh. I'm sorry, did you say ex-husbands with an "S"? All four of them. Rich and dead. They call my mom "The Black Widow." Oh, great. Okay... This is all we got, unless you want to wear something of mine. My stepdad's. The last one. Okay, here's the deal. We take my mom's Jag to the hospital tomorrow. You and I are a couple, and we plan on getting married and going back to Costa Rica. She buys it, and I'll give you some of the money for your son's lawyer, and I get to go back to Costa Rica and pay my mortgage. You gonna say anything or are you just gonna keep nodding your head like that? Okay, why are we getting married? Because... it's the sole condition of my mother's will. - I'm not killing your mother. - I appreciate that. - Well, what the fuck? - I don't want you to kill my mom. Okay. If we can lead her to believe that we are getting married, the idea would be that she would advance me some of the money that I'd be getting after she died, but before she dies. - I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. - No, Jackie. What's ridiculous is that you probably killed someone this morning, and then you kidnapped me, or you tried to, and here I am offering you a place to hide, some clothing, and a way to make money. You got any better ideas, Einstein? Okay, look. My son's detention hearing is in three days. That's a day that will basically determine how the rest of his life plays out. I don't even have the lawyer yet. Hmm? My mom's dying of cancer. I don't want to get in a pissing contest here, but sometimes life is tough. We're in this together now. Well, that's nice. Separately. All right, try to get some rest. This ain't gonna be easy. My mom's an animal. - Where do I sleep? - There's, like, five bedrooms. I don't know. Choose one. Thank you. Yeah, hey. This is Raymond Chandler, from the probation department. I just got a call from the D.A.'s office about a kid named Billy Powers, who's awaiting trial with you guys over there who was processed last week, I believe. Anyway, apparently, this kid's diabetic and, uh, it wasn't listed when he came in, so you guys would be doing me a big favor if you could look out for him. Maybe throw him a candy bar here and there. It'd really, really keep us all out of the hot seat if you could do that. That'd be great. That'd be great. I really appreciate it. Billy Powers. Here you go, Powers. Thank you. Let me know if you need anything else, okay? Did I interrupt the orgy? Have a seat. Is this all for me? Or do you greet all your guests like this? No, not all of them, just the ones that try to have me killed. That guy-- That guy was just supposed to scare you. I look scared? Yeah, you do, actually. This ain't me scared, boy. This is me pissed off. Well, whatever it is, facts don't change. You owe Pauly Russo 100 grand, going on six weeks now. If we wanted you dead, that's what you'd be. Well, here's what's gonna happen. You boys are gonna forgive my debt now. That's pretty fucking cute. I'll tell you what. Can you, uh, pour me a glass of whatever that is that you're drinking there? I got a lot of ties to the law out here. I make a phone call, you and your boss have a shitload of trouble that I promise you you don't want. Now you're threatening me? That, I don't like. I appreciate the advice. You got a week to come up with the bread. And I'm sorry about yesterday. That guy that came to see you, um... he must've gone off his meds. I don't know what else to tell you. Can I say something now? It's your fucking house... or barn, or whatever you call this shithole. I had every intention of paying what I owe. We just move a little slower where I come from. Now, patience ain't your thing. I guess I can understand that, but you boys crossed a line. I can't tell you how easy it'd be for me to call the law and tell them Pauly Russo tried to have me killed. So don't fucking tell me what I will or will not do, especially not in my own barn. You ain't going to the police. The fact is, only two people really know what happened yesterday. Might be somebody else knows what happened yesterday. Just saying. I'll see you inbreds around. - The answer is no, Lola. - I don't understand you, Mom. "How are you feeling?" "Oh, not so good, dear." It feels like a diseased fat man is sitting on my lungs. I asked and you said you didn't want to talk about it. - Sometimes "no" means "yes." - Mom, we're getting married. - We're getting married. - Oh, congratulations. I'm doing what you always wanted me to do. Yeah, that's the problem. You think I'm an idiot? Don't you find it slightly off-putting that you show up here out of nowhere and ask me for money? Now? Here in this place? - I came here to see you. - Oh, really? Because I'm dying, or because your acting career that I told you repeatedly over the years was a waste of time didn't work out? - You won. I gave that up a long time ago. Acting school in Guatemala. Jesus Christ. - Costa Rica. - Even dumber. I didn't come back here to be ridiculed for my poor life choices, Mom. And by the way, when was the last time you checked in on me? That's not my job. A daughter calls, a mother answers. You know how many times my mother called me? Your mother tried to kill you when you were 13. Exactly. You know, Mom, I don't want to lose what I have down there. All of our bullshit aside, don't you want me to be happy? I want... crab legs. - What? - I don't know why. I never had a thing for crab. Now I'm waking up at night thinking about crab legs. - Hey, Jackie. - Hmm? - You like stories? - Sure. - I've got a good one. - Here we go. Do you know what they call me? The Black Widow. That's right. She did tell me. Mm. Four dead husbands within a year of saying "I do." I can only assume I earned that title because when the black widow reproduces, she often kills her mate, but that's ridiculous because I didn't mate with any of them. This one's father got away somehow. - Lucky, lucky. - Now you tell me... Is it because I kill people when I bite? Because when they die, I wear black? Or could it be that I have a red birthmark somewhere on or around my vagina? - Oh, my God. - I'm a survivor, Jackie. Now, interesting fact about the female black window, - and this is science. - Science. They're meant to outlive their mates. And why? It's because she's focused on what she wants. And nobody or nothing is gonna get in her way. And what I want is a cigarette. And some crab legs. Be a doll, Jackie. Oh, you want me to... - Never make a lady beg. - Okay. Uh... - The keys, dear? - In the ignition. Oh, good. Um... I'll be back before you can say "crab legs," okay? - He's handsome. - You scare people. Kenny Walsh loves golf. Kenny Walsh loves a nice cup of coffee. Kenny Walsh loves himself some trim. Who talks? Money talks. I'm Kenny Walsh... and Kenny Walsh loves the kids. Are you gonna help me, Mom? So, what do you want me to do, Billy? Get me out of here. Oh, okay. Well, and how do you expect that I do that? Tell me. Tell me. I don't know. I don't know, but I'm freaking out, I'm, uh... I was talking to my counselor and he was saying I could even end up in prison-- Uh-oh! Uh-oh. Yeah, that's not good. Yeah. Well, maybe you should've thought about that one before you kidnapped another child. I did not fucking kidnap anyone, Mom. I told you. I showed up at Chad's, and the kid was there. Yeah, and what did I tell you about the last fucking time that you hung out with fucking Chad? - Huh? - You're right. I'll never go to Chad's ever again. Yo, hurry up, man. I need to make a phone call. One sec. It's my girl. - Are you gonna get me a lawyer? - You know what? I've been spending every fucking day looking for a fucking lawyer for you, Billy. I can't even afford to feed myself, all right? Yo, hurry up, man. You didn't hear me the first time? - I need to make a phone call. - Yeah. Connection. Are you gonna come see me tomorrow? I'm gonna do the best I fucking can, all right? I'm sorry, man. I just got off the phone. - I told you that two times ago. - Yeah. Hey, Mama. How you doing? I think that's my last crab. So how about that cigarette, Jackie boy? You know what, Mom? Forget it. I knew I shouldn't have come back here. God forbid I need anything from anyone, let alone my own mother. Oh, the drama of it all! You should've been a thespian. If you weren't dying, I'd say something horrible right now. Yeah, well, if I wasn't dying, maybe I'd give a shit. - Okay, you want the truth? - Jackie. - That's my favorite. - Great. My 15-year-old son was arrested last week for something he did not do. It's a serious charge, and he needs a lawyer. Your daughter and I have not known each other for very long, okay? But she is, without question, the most interesting human being I have ever met in my life. I love her and I want to marry her, okay? But the truth right now, we need that money for a lawyer so we can get my kid out of jail, all right? - Well, I thank you for your honesty. - - Thank you. - But why don't you just bail him out? - There is no bail. Uh, in the juvenile system, there's no bail. It's different. I need to get him out, like, now. So how much does this lawyer cost? Uh... I'm guessing like $25,000? You're guessing? I will know the second I secure the lawyer. Well, you do that, and when you come back, - I will write you a check. - Oh, thank you. Unless, of course, I change my mind. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Wait. Oh! - I love you, son. - I love you too. I love the both of you very much. Oh, God. He's a keeper. That means a lot coming from you. Tsk. All right. I'm sorry I can't give you any money right now. I will, however, put up the money for your soon-to-be stepson, because, for some reason, it seems like the right thing to do but beyond that, my instincts are telling me otherwise. I know we don't understand each other, Lola. We never did. But if you could accept the things that I do... that even I can't explain... that would be my final wish. Can you do that? I can try. She's known you for two minutes! Crab legs, a sappy abridged monologue, and she's ready to write you a check? Do you know how many times I've asked her for money over the years? - I can imagine. - My whole life. My whole fucking life, she's treated me like shit. "I'm talented, Mom. I'm really good at what I do. All I need is a plane ticket to New York City, and a little bit of cash." Nope. Fuck off, darling. - Look, I'm really sorry. - What are you sorry for? You got what you wanted. Bravo. You should've been the actor. Look, you deserve better, period, okay? But so does my kid. I know you're upset right now, but I'm begging you, please, please stick with me on this. I also want you to know I meant what I said back there. Which part? I really gotta get to a phone. I'm sorry, but I gotta-- I gotta get to a phone. What the fuck do these people do? She blows rich guys. It's the girl's mother's house. I'm out here all fucking day. Nothing. You really think Walter is gonna go to the police? I can't be too fucking sure, can I? But what I can be 100% fucking sure is that I don't want to fucking find out. My uncle back fucking home with the RICO charges, all I need now is to face a fucking murder rap, okay? So do me a fucking favor, and find fucking Jackie and make him understand, make him fucking understand, I need him to turn himself in, and if he does that, when he gets out of fucking jail, if he gets out of fucking jail, we're gonna take care of him, okay? Do that for me. - What about the kid? - Fuck the kid, okay? - That ship sailed. - What the fuck? - Go, go, go! - What? - Gun it! Go straight! - What are you doing? Gun it! Go! Go! Go! Go! This is a fucking bust. I need to get back to my fucking life. I think I got an idea where he might be headed next. Now you're talking, Dom. Now, go follow that idea and fucking make him understand. - Yeah? - Yeah. Tomorrow, I'm gonna go up, I'm gonna see Walter. I'm gonna take care of this bullshit by myself. Careful. That fucking hillbilly's ready for war over there. I'm gonna come in peace, obviously. - It's gonna be fucking amazing. - Right. You believe this shit? I gotta go beg for fucking money? I gotta go beg for my fucking money? Anybody at home hears about this, they're like, "Wait, what the fuck happened to Pauly?" "I don't know. He moved out to Oklahoma and became a cunt." Fuck. Jesus Christ, Taylor. What are you, on dial-up here? If you don't like my shit, then go somewhere else. In fact, you should just go elsewhere and you should take this whore with you. - Excuse me? - Please, Taylor? This is a family matter. I don't know what you're doing here. Call me a whore again and see what happens. - And who are you? - A friend. That's weird. Jackie doesn't have any friends. - Can you please, Taylor? - You want to know why? - I don't. - It's because he's a really big asshole. - A big, gaping asshole. - Lovely. Lovely. - Would you like some advice? - I definitely don't. Well, what I think you should do is, you should run and run as fast as you can. And if you're pregnant already, then make a left - and go straight to the clinic. - All right, that's enough. I can see that your life's shit here, and I'd rather not, but keep it up, and I'll knock your fucking teeth in. - Is that a threat? - What the fuck else would it be? Hey, uh, Mr. Walsh, my-my name is Jackie Powers, okay? My son is Billy Powers. He's currently at Haskell awaiting a detention hearing, which is in two days. Please call me back at your earliest convenience. My number is 918-793-1248. Thank you very much. Why did you give my number? - Oh, my God. - It's for your son, Taylor. Okay. Ahem. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Go ahead. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck. Back door, now. Let's go. Out, out, out. Back door. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. We gotta go. - What are you talking about? - Now, now, now. - Listen to me. Listen to me. - What? - That is Dom, okay? Please... - Oh. What? If you mention that you've seen me, Billy is fucked. Do the right thing. Don't fuck with me, Taylor. Don't fuck with me. Do the right thing and give me your word you will not mention that you've seen me. Okay. Go. - Get the fuck out of here. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Who is it? - It's the police. Yeah, right. Where is he? Who? Come on, don't be cute. Jackie. I haven't seen him. What was that? All right, it was him, okay? But I really have no idea where he was going. Why don't I believe you? Because you're a fucking asshole, that's why. All right, Taylor, with the bullshit. All right, you're just gonna leave? Yeah, I didn't come here for that. You know what your problem is? You treat me like shit for a reason. No, I treat you like shit because you're an asshole and you deserve it most of the time. No, you're still mad that I chose Jackie and not you. Chose Jackie? You didn't choose shit. Look at this fucking place. I'll tell you why you ended up with Jackie and not me. It's real fucking simple. You made a mistake. It's no big deal, but don't treat me like I'm the bad guy. You want me to stay and throw a fuck in you... just tell me to stay. Always gotta be a fucking thing with this one. They were all out of crab legs. I just can't believe you had a child with that woman. Like, on purpose. Yeah, well, you should've seen her 20 years ago. Whatever. Same brain. What? Uh... Do you, um... Do you-do you... Do you like me? What if they don't let me in to see your son tomorrow? - They-- they will. - We have different last names. Right. Do you know how many kids in that place have two parents with the same last names? None of them. But what if impersonating someone's mother to visit is, like, a thing? - It's not. - How do you know, though? Because I grew up in there. That guy, Dom? Him too. We met in there when we were 13 years old. You see what he's doing with his life? There's no rehabilitation in the juvenile system. The place just fucks you up, period. I'm gonna help you get Billy out of there. Ah-ha. So, is that-that a yes, you do like me or...? You really want to play this game? An exercise? Yeah, why not? Okay. - I'll play then. - Okay. What are you doing? I don't just like you, Jackie. I love you. The second you walked into that greasy spoon, my heart skipped a beat. I knew in that moment things were gonna change forever. I knew the man I was gonna spend the rest of my days with just walked into my life. But then you shot the cook. - Pretty good, right? - Yeah. I told you I had talent. That was very good. Amazing. Should we go inside? Uh... There's just one bed in there, so I figured I'd let you get some sleep. I'll just crash out here a little bit, I guess. - Okay, good night. - No, I mean... Such a fucking idiot. Lola? What the fuck? "Don't worry. Just went to get donuts and coffee. Love, Lola." Thank you. Jesus Christ. - Hello? - - Hey,, uh, did the lawyer call yet? No, uh-uh, no. It's 7:30 in the morning. He hasn't called yet. Okay. What happened with Dom after I left last night? - Oh, it wasn't bad. - It wasn't bad? What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means that he came in, he asked if you were here. - I said no, then he left. - Come on, you bitch. Get the address. And I'm really tired right now, so can you please let me wake up? Whatever, Taylor. Please, just, if that lawyer calls, let me know immediately. It's very important, okay? I'm at the Western Inn on 11th. Street. Room 129, okay? Okay. Great. Thank you. Fucking weirdo. Things have gotten way out of hand here, Walter. Well, there's something we can agree on. It was never my intention. Okay. Well, now that you mentioned it, what exactly was your intention? Bottom line is, you made some very serious bets with me. - You lost. - I don't have a problem with that. Apparently, you do, because I'm here with you now. I pay my debts. I just needed more time. But we're not talking about me now, are we? We're talking about you and your intention. You know... Look, Walter, as far as I'm concerned, whatever that fucking jerk-off did, he was way out of line. It's not what I wanted, okay? But that is no longer my problem. I already told you, he's on his way to turn himself in as we speak. Okay? Now, I'm sure you take some kind of fucking comfort in knowing the jerk-off who tried to kill you is gonna spend the rest of his life behind bars eating shitty ham sandwiches, Walter. I'm here to work this out with you, man, peacefully. That's a courtesy, Walter. Please don't mistake it for anything else. You know anything about raising cattle? I'm from Brooklyn. It isn't a complicated business. I deal with them. They belong to me. Time comes to sell, I let them go. One of my steers gets sick, or one of them just don't do right when they land, that's my responsibility, and I own that. Okay. I've been in these parts a long time now, almost 40 years doing what I do. I got a lot of friends, law and otherwise. You are a guest here. Now I understand... you might have your own feelings about things, but... whether or not you feel responsible for where we've landed is unfortunately irrelevant. I only asked as a courtesy. Let's not mistake that for something else. You see... a force has swung the tide here. And while I appreciate the visit, Pauly... I stand by my word. I don't owe you a goddamn thing. You really want to take this road with me, Walter? You are welcome to find out, my friend. Hey! Fuck! Here's what's gonna happen, Jackie. You're gonna turn yourself in. You're gonna confess to killing the guy in the diner, and that's the end of it. Okay. Okay. - What about Billy? - Stay right the fuck where you are. Come on. Billy is, uh... He's not our problem anymore. Okay, then no. Get fucked. - "No, get fucked"? - Yeah. - What are you, a fucking parrot? - Watch it, Jackie. Oh, I'm supposed to be scared of you now because you got a gun? What the fuck? Jack, you got yourself in this fucking situation. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you, big tough guy from Boston. - Your first day in Central... - Fuck you. ...you looked like you were gonna piss yourself. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have lasted two seconds in that place. You are nothing but an errand boy, ho. Hey, you're a punchy cocksucker. You know what I think? I think you got hit one too many times in that dopey fucking head of yours, - and your memory is mush. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. - Yeah? You're an ungrateful little motherfucker, you know that? - I ought to fuck you up right now. - Oh, yeah? With or without the gun, tough guy? This ain't the fucking ring, Jack. I fucking dare you to put that gun down. It won't be the first time I fucked you up. - I'll bust your fucking hole right now. - All right. Let me see it. - Come on. - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Can I put my clothes on first? Please do. Oh. - Donut? - We should probably go, okay? Now. - Cool outfit. - Thanks. Come on. - Are you gonna wear that? - No. All right. Listen... I'd be doing this myself, okay? But on the off chance I'm currently wanted for murder, I don't think it's a good idea. - Probably not. - Look, you're not-- you're not actually committing a crime. No, I'm pretty sure I am. Okay, fine, yes, but it's like jaywalking. It's illegal, but people do it, you know? - Got it. - You're gonna be great, okay? And please, do not forget to get a copy of his files. By law, they have to give them to you. - To his mother. - To whoever. Whatever. You get what I'm saying, okay? You're an actor. Act. - Anything else? - No. Yes. Tell him I love him, and everything's gonna be fine. - Please. - Okay. Hurry up. Tell me when. - Tonight, 7:00. - Oh, no. Dude... Dude, I couldn't walk until Friday after last Tuesday. Yeah, she was huge. I mean, a girl that big, who looks like her? She had shoulders like John Elway. - Hello? - That was a big girl, T. - What time? - 7:00, baby. 7:00 P.M. 7:00 P.M. I'm here-- I'm here to visit my son, Billy Powers. Jesus. Hang on a sec, John. Lola... Brisky. Lola Brisky. Yeah, just visiting my-my son. All right. Fill this out. Take all your belongings and put them in that locker. I'm also gonna need a copy of his files. You'll have to talk to intake after the visit. She sounds hot, man. Oh, dude, she was hot. What the fuck was her name? - She was smoking. - Fuck. Yeah. Lola Brisky. Let me tell you something, partner. Kenny Walsh has represented more juvenile cases than anyone in this town. Kenny Walsh is not perfect, but... he's pretty damn close. Now, Kenny Walsh spent 15 years in the D.A.'s office. That doesn't hurt. No, I-I-I read that on your site. Just to be clear, who are you? I'm Kenny Walsh. Who the fuck do you think I am? Great. Okay, I was just clarifying. I did call that number that you left on my service several times this morning, but no answer. Right. Right, that figures. I'm not sure what that means, but clearly you have some problems, or else you wouldn't be here. But enough about Kenny Walsh. How can I help you? Okay, um, uh, my son, as I mentioned on your service, Billy Powers, his detention hearing is tomorrow, okay? I know that that is very short notice, - but I assure you, he is a good kid. - Uh-huh. Never been in any trouble with the law whatsoever. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Stop right there. - Okay. Kenny Walsh is not the judge. Good or bad, doesn't make a difference to him. Okay. Let me ask you. Who talks? Money talks. Ah. Yeah. Right. - You have his case file? - No. But I will have his case file and a check for you for $20,000 by the end of the day. - Today? - Today. Kenny Walsh will be here. Great. Once I get that aforementioned in my hand, your son will be too. And that's a good thing. Kenny Walsh always gets it done. That's-that's very good. Okay. Thank you. - Um, help yourself with a lollipop. - Okay. I'm your mother, Billy. Your father is outside, and he says he loves you very much. I'm just getting your files for the lawyer. Do you understand? - Yeah. - Good. I'll go get your files. I'm really scared. Will you just talk to me? - Yeah. - Thank you. I didn't do anything wrong. They'd already kidnapped the kid when I showed up. I just don't belong here. Yeah, I believe you. My mom... I mean, that woman. I haven't seen her in two weeks. I don't-- I just-- I just don't want to stay here. Your dad's working on it. Oh. Oh, great. That's supposed to make me feel better? - Hey, he really loves you. - I know he does. - He's-- He's just... - What? He's just always been such a fuck up. I mean, you must know that, right? I actually think your dad's pretty special, but don't tell him I said so, okay? I won't. By the way, are you diabetic? No. Do I look fat? This is very, very, very... fucking embarrassing. - You're telling me? - Yes, Dom. I'm fucking telling you. You know why? Two reasons. First, you're the only fuck sitting in front of me, and the other reason is, because you're the fucking cause of me being embarrassed. I'll find Jackie again. Oh, I know you're gonna find Jackie, and this time, you're gonna whack him. Come on, Pauly. Get the fuck outta here. Look at my fucking face. Look at my fucking face. I look like I'm joking to you? Do I look like I'm joking to you? I should've never listened to you in the first place about this fucking kid to begin with. That's what I said to you two days ago, and you said-- Don't fucking tell me what I said. Don't fucking tell me what I said. I know what I fucking said. I can't change my mind? Jesus fucking Christ. Listen to me. Listen to me. What the fuck happened to me? I mean, look what I'm wearing. I'm wearing a fucking belt buckle. I swear on my dead mother, I can feel my fucking ego melting out of my-my-my asshole. I'm telling you, Pauly. We take care of Jackie's kid, we get him a lawyer - and this whole thing ends. - No. No. Fucking no. No. No. Fucking no and no. And no! And no! You don't fucking tell me! I fucking tell you! You don't tell me fucking nothing. I'm in this fucking jam to begin with because of you. - Yeah. I'm clear on that now. - Oh, good. Okay, wise ass. Watch yourself, okay? You want to be clear on something else? I'll tell you. Nice guy fucking Pauly is done. I'm gonna drive out to that cowboy cocksucker's fucking ranch and I am personally gonna shoot him in the fucking head. But you are gonna find that little cunt and you're gonna fucking shoot him the same way I shoot the other fucking guy. Are we clear? Oh, God. How'd it go? - You have a good kid. - Oh, it's beautiful. All right, we're good on time. Let's go. - Hopefully, she didn't change her mind. - Please don't say that. Oh, Jesus. This fucking thing. Okay, I'm an excellent driver. I'm so sorry. She was eating crab legs. She seemed fine. I swear to God, she did this on purpose. Died? Yeah. Take me home. I don't think that's a good idea. Fine, then. Take me to the airport. So what, you don't think there's a chance that we can still get the money? Are you fucking kidding me? - It's a legitimate question. - Hey, yeah, sure. All we have to do is just get married real quick. Okay, is that something we can actually do? Oh, my-- I wasn't being serious, you fucking sociopath. If it were that easy, I could've married some other asshole - a long time ago. - That's very nice. You know, the people who control the will, they have instructions. It takes time. It's not like I get a chunk the second I say "I do." I'm just trying to figure out what to do, okay? And for the record, so you know, I would marry you. I know you would. You're a fucking sociopath. Will you stop calling me that? All the shit that you said to my mom at the hospital about how much you really like me and you want to spend the rest of your life with me? It takes a certain kind of person to do some shit like that. Oh, okay. What about you at the motel? "I love you, Jackie. In this greasy spoon when we met eyes," and all that bullshit, whatever it was you said, huh? That's different. We were just messing around. - No, no. I don't mess around that way. - Whatever, okay? Whatever! I'm getting the fuck out of here. You just go to your lawyer, take my mom's car, maybe he'll take it. - That's great! - I'm getting the fuck out of here. That's great! I'd love to do that, except that my lawyer's fucking closed. I know that because we just passed the place. Well, sorry for the hold up. Dead mom gets you every time. Oh, cut the crap! Like it was a big loss. You hated her anyway. Fuck. Okay, you're gonna have to stop the car now. Get the fuck out of it, and pretend that I don't exist. That's great. That's great, because I have a new plan - and it doesn't involve you. - Great. Okay? I'm gonna go into that courtroom tomorrow, I'm gonna bring this, I'm gonna get my son and I'm gonna shoot my way out - of that miserable place. - That's brilliant. Maybe you should get some bullets and learn how to use it first, you fucking moron. Fuck. You're welcome, by the way, for everything. Can you look at me? Thank you. No one in my entire life has ever been there for me the way you have the last couple of days. For whatever it's worth, and I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I really do love you. I gotta go take care of my kid. Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's go get this cowboy cocksucker. Okay, what's next? Detention hearing for Billy Powers, Your Honor. He's 16. No priors. And what's the charge? Kidnapping, Your Honor. Do we have a lawyer? We are told he has an attorney, but... All right. It's kidnapping, so there's really nothing to talk about. He's gonna remain a ward of this court until the trial date. I need the public defender in here, so we can make that official. Very good, Your Honor. I'm sorry, Your Honor, I apologize. May I? Not until you tell me who you are, you can't. Of course. My name is Harold Hunter. I'm representing Billy Powers here. And again, I apologize. I'm new in town. I got a little lost. I'm with Kenny Walsh's firm. - Oh, you are? How is Mr. Walsh? - You know, the guy's my hero, so I'm only gonna say nice things. Well, I was just saying to Mr. Thomas here that we're gonna go ahead and set this matter for a trial, and your client can remain in custody until that time. Yeah, I don't think that that's a good idea, Your Honor. - Oh, no? - No. If I may? - Please. - Thank you. At the time of arrest, my client was found to be under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. There's no excuse for that. A charge worth punishment, if you ask me. Now, I'm not here to speak on the other juveniles who were arrested for the so-called kidnapping, but the way I understand it, they took a classmate against his will back to one of their parents' homes. - Yeah. - Kidnapping. Right. Again, I'm not here to speak on what those other children did, but my client, he showed up after the fact and he had no idea what was going on until after he arrived. Well, why didn't he leave? I can't answer that question, Your Honor, and I'm not implying that that question doesn't need to be answered. He's a good kid. No priors. I mean, aside from not making the right decision to leave immediately, and, of course, the drinking and smoking, the only thing Billy Powers is guilty of is bad taste. I believe that he should be allowed to stay with his mother while awaiting trial. Of course, with the court's recommendation for monitoring. Well, that leads me to my next question. Where is the mother? - I'm here, Your Honor. - She's here. Ma'am, come up here, please. I'm looking at a report, ma'am, that says that law enforcement attempted to make several calls to your residence. Those phone calls were never answered. There's also indication that the probation office did as well, yet no call back? No attempt by you to contact anyone? I cannot release your son into your custody without a reasonable explanation. I was scared. I was so scared, I didn't know what to do. We only have each other. Billy's father died in a... in a horrible boating accident back in 2015. Billy was just a boy. When I received the messages, I, uh... I did some research, and upon learning the severity of the charges, I just broke down and I couldn't find the will to get back up. I knew we couldn't afford an attorney. I'm currently working three jobs just so we can get by. I don't know how I did it, but... somehow I managed to pick myself back up, and I reached out to Mr. Hunter here, and he told me that Billy was in a lot of trouble, but at the same time, he wasn't gonna stand for this injustice. He believes in the law... and, out of the goodness of his heart... he agreed to take Billy's case on free of charge. God bless you. He's a good boy, Your Honor. He deserves better. If there's anyone to blame here, it's me. I've just been so busy, you know... I've been so busy with the three jobs - and the-- and the cancer... Yeah, uh, Your Honor, she's obviously upset and, uh... I think that we should, uh, move to... to move, really. Um, but you get-- you get the point. And I know it is not your fault. I recognize that, I do. Your mother and her beliefs, they were not that of the Apostle, but of her own. She instilled them into you, and I need you to see that. And then the steel rings with the iron cross. You know the iron cross? When you do... like this in the rings. It's the muscle moves, okay? After rings, you got parallel bars. Who the hell is that? Can I help you? Yeah, we got a pizza delivery for Walter Boggs. We didn't order no fucking pizza. Well, somebody's gonna eat it. I'm coming out! Fuck! Walter! You cocksucker! I'm coming in, you motherfucker! I'm coming in! Walter! Come out, come out, you cocksucker! Big bad wolf is here to collect. Come and get it! I got all night, fuck-o! Shit, I live here. Come on, come out, Walt. Let's talk. No, you're my guest. I insist. Hey, buddy. Hey, Dad. - It's good to see you. - Thanks. Should we get out of here? Yeah, that's probably a good idea, huh? You guys are gonna take me to my mom's? Is that what you want? Uh-uh. Costa Rica? Walter! I told you I got all night... Walter. Yeah? You sure about that now? Fuck. Fuck. Yeah, fuck. Fuck you. Fuck! Are you okay? - Jackie! - Dad! Dad! Hey, stop it! What are you gonna do with that, Billy? Let him go. You're a tough guy now too, Billy? A lot of balls, kid. You want to play guns? You want to play fucking guns? No, get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. Come on. Come on. Heart of a lion, Jackie. Heart of a lion. Make sure I never see you again, okay? You won't. Hey, Jackie. You still hit like a girl. - Here's what's gonna happen. - Tell me. You're gonna confess to killing that guy in the diner and then this shit is over. - I mean it. Over. - Okay. What about Billy? What... Whoa! Don't fucking move, all right? Billy is a big boy. I'll write to him. What are you, a tough guy with a gun now? - I'm supposed to be scared of you? - This is not my fault. We are not in this situation because of me. No, no. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you specifically. Once a bitch, always a bitch. - If I'm a bitch... - Uh-huh. ...it's because every single time I help you out, I get fucked in the ass! You looked like you were gonna piss yourself your first day at Central. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have lasted three seconds in that place, okay? Jackie, I'm not fucking playing, all right? You're gonna do it, or I'm gonna fucking shoot you. I fucking dare you to put that gun down. I fucking dare you. Please. - Without the fucking gun! - Okay. Can I put my fucking clothes on first? Put your clothes on! I don't want your balls in my face! - Oh, fuck! - Fuck! Fucking... Oh! Fuck.
