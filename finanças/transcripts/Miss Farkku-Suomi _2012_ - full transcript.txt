That girl is too fat. That girl's got squirrel teeth. What's she think she is? Fags ain't supposed to be seen in the pictures. So our Pirjo's gonna be Miss Blue Jeans? This yours? - Library's stuff. Whose is it? - Välde's. You're a faggot? You're a queer. Let's see. You weren't at school. So what? Gonna drop out a class again. Right now I got better things to do. This what you listenin' to? You can't play Deep Purple to women. Minibar ready yet? This'll be handy for vodka bottles. And the seats recline. So you could sleep too. Yeah, sleep. Jesus freaks. And the cabbage. Fine. Thanks for borrowing. Good looking bras. So what are you listenin'? - Lou Reed. It's about a transvestite - who wants his guy to lick his boots. - Turn it up. Old man will hear. - He's eatin'. Me and Lassi eat on the second sitting. You listen, I got other things to do. Did Jouko's mum put a potty on 'is head and cut around it? Jouko's got proper track shoes. Our Jouko's gonna break the record? Today is the Cooper test. Ossi'll run four miles then too. Välde's got cool joggers. You could lend him some stripes from yours. This is the last athletics class this spring. Then we'll start playing soccer on Välivainio field. Partanen. One minute! Tipi, Tipi! - Go on Jussi! Four minutes up! Seven! Eight! Nine! Poofter. Välimaa!! Up! Ten! Cooper was a Nazi. - Sure was. Välimaa! - We ain't runnin' this shit race. Time's up! Any idea why people who're even a bit different - are bullied and called fags? Coz everyone's scared of being queer themselves. Lou Reed openly sings about mankind's dark side. He's written that everything abnormal is perfectly normal. Who? - Lou Reed. Sure all men wanna fuck their mums sometime. Or kill someone. Sure you've been horny for your friend - or wanna put on your aunt's bra. Or kicked a dog. Everybody, even the Pope and our bishop has wanked. So in that case we're all queer, right? I mean there's stuff you're not allowed to talk about. Kaitsu comin' to Pike's bash? - On Saturday, yeah. Välde, you comin'? Not invited. - You are now. It's my old man's confirmation suit. Is it overdressin' if I wear this? - How come? You know, if you don't know how to play baseball- an' you anyway go to the pitch with a bran' new glove. Ain't no matter. Works better than the cardigans mum bought. Gonna show'em I'm so special- they better ask me for every gig in town. Gonna get laid tonight? Got myself clean pants just in case. Wanna hear some music? Captain Beefheart? A masterpiece of avantgarde rock. You've gotta be tough to listen to both sides. Tell us something. Tell us about the girl. She gonna be your girlfriend? People like Pike value others - on the basis of their social status. I'm too low class. How is that? - Many things effect it. Looks. How famous you are. Dough. Social skills an' violent behaviour. Good looks is a must for women, but useful for men, too. Fame means you get into ordinary people's lives - in the paper, on radio, or tv. Like you managed to "get" in the paper. Wealth I don't know much about - but if you're a rich, big shot mother fucker - they appreciate you twice as much. An' if you're an unhappy wimp they hate you. Social skills don't just mean talk the talk - but you gotta know the right people too. Take Jussi Ekdahl in our class. Everybody knows and respects him but he's nothing special. And what? - Bein' tough. Nobody throws shit at you bible bashers, but for others, - if you wanna get respect you gotta prove you ain't a sissy. Gotta walk on thin ice or jump out a movin' car. Swear a lot. Piss on the town hall. Get stone drunk, wet your pants and puke. Beat-up some moron. Violence is a scary thing but you gotta respect it. It's better to be on good terms with a violent jerk - but just try to keep out of his way. It's real easy for me 'cause I got no place in the hierarchy. I got nothin' to lose and everything to gain. Welcome Kaitsu and Välde. Have some punch. If we beat Ropsi at home - we gonna get to the county championship. Did you see last weekend at Seelari disco? Köpi'd bought the exact same type of Amazon - that he'd just wrecked. What are you talkin' about? - Nothin'. What about disco? - Circus Marcus is gonna play there. So fed up with him. - So who's better? Henri Hakala. - He's no real DJ. Pike, Dj Marcus is the best dj in Oulu, ain't he? How'd I know? Bring me some more! - And me! Wanna go somewhere? Tiina, you've grown tits. - How fuckin' funny. Sure I am. Can I try? Where you goin'? - For a fag. Was that girl your sister? - Oh Katja. Yeah. I don't know. I'd like to go to London. Yeah. It's happenin' there. Lot of cool bands. Did you read in newspaper, some unemployed guy went crazy here? Shot at kids playing in a sandpit. A little girl who was already deaf, she's blind now as well. Some of those folks live here. Com' on. Gonna kill ourselves, eh? You've got guts. You're gonna be a writer, or somethin'. Go for a coffee tomorrow? Gonna go to Helsinki tomorrow. Miss Blue Jeans finals gonna be there. Who'd you ring, if you could choose anyone? - Lou Reed. I got a coin. - I ain't got his number. We tories just want the talented - to be given a chance to shine in this world. The tories just wanna be buddies with the US and NATO. If we joined NATO there'd soon be a third world war. What about the YYA Treaty with the Soviet Union? And Solzhenitsyn? Not part of the school board election! Could Finland join NATO? - And Hungary? Let Kurkku speak! The whole Nobel prize is bollocks! Solzhenitsyn got it - 'cause they just wanted to fuck around with the Soviets. The Soviets want peace an'... Pike won! Pike won! Pike won! Pike got into the Ronski Gang tour bus. Oh, it's nothin'. - And one's goin' to London. Pike! We tories want to promote - just your kind of young and talented people! Pirjo, phone! Pike. - Congrats. Is that Välde? - Yeah. Are you Miss Blue Jeans now? - I guess so. A journalist! Pike'll call you in a minute. ...fair and fun, we've been friends since we were kids. Pike is great. What's Välde doin' sittin' here alone? You're eyeing on chicks' arses? - Or blokes'? Or you came to see if Pike'd ask you for a walk again? I think Pike's got another date. You're pissed that Hakala won in the school election? You wanted the commies to win. Fuck you're such an ugly bastard. You're uglier than your mum. - If I was you, I'd shut up. What are you saying? What's the little faggot saying? Ever even seen your dad? Or did he fuck your ma in the looney bin? Faggot! - Moron! You got thrown out too? They took me bottle, but I had a back-up. Want some? What's up? - Couldn't be better. Hey beautiful, gimme some pussy! - Never mind. She's way better lookin' in the flesh than in photos. Listen to these morons. Our band is way better. You got a band? - Sure the fuck I do. What d'you play? - You know Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground? What's your name? - Sasu. - Välde. Heard of the New York Dolls? And you Patti Smith? Fuck, what a bitch. Wanted to buy "Horses" but they didn't have it. I got Iggy and the Stooges' Raw Power. - Syd Barrett. Roxy Music. Did you read the story of Andy Warhol in a paper? Know Robert Maplethorpe, eh? He's a queer too. Pals with Patti Smith. Let's kiss. What'd Lou Reed say if he found out - there's two fuck faces on some edge coast drinkin' booze - and singin' his song? - Faggots! Morons! You play somethin'? - No. I gotta a guitar, but never learnt to play. We need a vocalist. Wanna come and listen us play? They fuckin'? - Who? Well, Pike and Hakala. - I guess so. You're givin' up? You mean I'd settle for a regular old bitch - and an average life? No. I rather kill myself. Guess you know who gets the best lookin' chicks? - Well? Rockers. Gotta start playin' the guitar. Gotta lose weight. Gotta start joggin'. I'm goin' out. We eatin' soon. - Not hungry. You wanna be someone, you wanna break through, - be some-one-e... But where's your personality crisis? Did it already pass, is it all over now? In English please. It's more personal in Finnish. Without English, we can't reach the world. Let's do it in Finnish. Pike? You can get the A-note from the phone. In this fuckin' guitar there's no god damn rock'n roll. Had to get some echo. Gotta invent a new past. Gotta be hard and a fucker. Heard the latest Deep Purple? - Yeah. Any good? - I'd say it's bloody fantastic. I thought so too. Only dorks listen to Purple. My home town Oulu is full of ordinary bitches and blokes - who aren't interested in anything else - but the price of coffee. A typical Oulu citizen - wants a house of grey brick to barricade himself in it. Finally when he's bored to death, he gets drunk, - fucks everyone up and pisses on his own house. In the mornin' he's got a hangover, - he's remorseful and cleans his mess up. God has created this ugliness - and permits the wars, starvation and pollution. This landscape of trivialities - which the water tower watches over like a mushroom cloud - forces us to make choices we don't want. And makes us into the unwilling cogs in the engine of society. The Bible, pisshead teachers and trash tv entertainment, - religion, violence and sex are things Oulu people believe in. What d'you think of that Karjalainen? They say he'll follow our president. Ain't he got some drinking problem? - So right! The guy is a real drunkard - and still they wanna make him the next president. What took so long? - Got detention. What are you orderin'? - Iggy Pop's The Idiot. And you? Sex Pistols. We can swop later. Should we become unemployed and play punk - like the blokes in London? - Not punk. They gotta listen to us without havin' to be three cuts drunk. And we ain't usin' no safety pins or rags. Oh my god. Is that Välde? Green? - He's gotta fuckin' green head! Doesn't he, Tipi? - Soon you'll see. What-the-fuck-you-think-you're-? Fuckin' bacteria. One day you all come and say we were pals at school! Nutty bastard! Baboon. That your son? He's changed a bit since last summer. I saw you at the school gate - having a fag with others, you looked so fine. I didn't dare to stare. I said God, just let me have her - and I will believe in you. - You believe in God? I'd like to believe, - but someone who's fair with some sense of humour. I don' believe in a fuckfacegod. It was autumn and the yellow leaves of the park trees... Lou Reed writes about gays and druggies, - but he lives in New York. In my life there's only one thing with some drama. I saw you... I don't wanna use Pike's name in this. I saw you at the school bash. The band was too loud. - What is "in a bash"? It's slang. Sounds more like rock'n roll. I was probably the only sober one, - all the others were drunk like cocks. You pressed against my chest, no word came from my mouth. My hands sweating so I wet the back of your blouse. A-seven? There's no such chord. - There's now. I said God please gimme the words, so I can get you. But mighty God got bugged and didn't talk to me. The dude's done a track. Tart? - Välde made it up. It's the new name for our band. Why not Slab? Or Snot? - We got a song as well. I saw you at the school gate havin' a fag with others... What now? - I've had enough. Drummer wanted for Velvet Underground style band. Playing ability not important. The electric guitar and drums - dampen the message and sensitivity. They destroy the sense of hearing. The original music was played with acoustic instruments, - like harp, flute, harmonica... - With a comb. The comb, kazoo, clapping hands... - Piano. Piano, organ, horn... - These folks are totally out of it. Singing around the camp fire, in markets, church... You some kind of punks? - The Left keeps punks on a lead. And then the music was sold to the masses. Record managers and publicity took... Let's go ask if they'll give us pussy. You know them? - Who? Oh, Ana? He's Flash's manager. - Next to him. Kara, eh? That's his bit. Must be thirty or somethin'. I'll go n' ask. What? - You got coffee? What d'you want? - Coffee. Fuck off. Do I have to call the coppers? - I saw you yesterday. At the acoustic evening. Are you spying on me? Nah, I called Ana and asked where you live. You're a musician? - I got a band. What d'you play? Sort of Lou Reed and Velvet Underground type of stuff. You look like Nico in the Velvet Underground. Your mum's waiting for you at home. Not possible 'cause she's dead. Live alone? The babies are born as old men, - and the young men are ready to meet their graves. That's Eino Leino. I'm shaggin' with a house wife livin' next door. I read poetry for her in bed. - Get movin'. Got work to do. Why don't you paint that hay? Or the trees and the power line? You know art? - All national romanticism and dadaism is shit. More interested in Kalervo Palsa and Edward Munch - who really put themselves in it. Yeah, yeah, go now. - Can I borrow this Sinatra record? To give you an excuse to come dropin' around again. Sure, but get goin' now. - Yes, sure I could... An' Smith&Jones? You could watch it together. Be nice. And no mess. Välde said we can watch. Oh yeah, you're not supposed to. Thanks. Thanks. You been to Kara's!? Get some pussy? Nah, gotta be careful with women. Once they get to know you better, - they fall in love and then you never get rid of them. You gonna go again? - In a few days. Gotta show her I got other things to do. - Välde! You started playin'? - Yeah, this is Sasu. Heya. - Pike. Been modelling? Nah, some but it's not so hot as I thought. Quite small really. Had a trip to London. Did you see any celebrities? - Well yeah. We were in a party and this man started chattin'. He says he's a musician. I says my cousin plays in a dance hall band. "Old time dance hall" I says. And that he plays gigs in local dance halls. He was really interested. I asked which band he's in, and he says he's in Queen. Drums or bass, I don' remember. Yeah, only remember their singer with the protruding teeth. Goin' to sixth grade? - Yeah, an' yourself? Changed to another school so I could read French. Quite a few goin' to the vocational college. The boys at least. Tipi an' Partsu and Jussi Ekdahl. But have a nice summer. See you again. Guess if you made me look like an idiot?! You looked like an idiot! She was waitin' for a minute - for you to say somethin' to her. Why didn't you ask her out? - Not ready yet. You'll never be ready at that speed. Return. I wanna be an artist too. Drink wine, play records, and sit on a sofa all day. And wonder where to get money from for the next rent. My home town... This the girl from your class? - Guess so. Where've you played? - In jazz college. And eight. Here, that's your first month's pay. - Thank you. Is that all? - Yeah. I gotta pay all the overdue rents and the grocery bill. SECOND HAND BAND EEUIPMENT 4900 MARKS ...and the silent guy, wind, licks my hair. The concrete surfaces of my home town. The bridges of my home town, - goods yard and the coal wagons of my home yard. Trash bins of my home town, fences of my home town. Parking lots of my home town, nothing is missing from me. This is a fuckin' great piece of music. You gotta forget about Gene Krupa - and the academic monkey games. We ain't no jazz band. Attitude is the most important thing. All punk bands are shot against a brick wall. But we ain't no punk band. Why did we come 'ere where there's no one else? You afraid your commie friends will see us? What's you got against commies? - They're so predictable. USA and commercialism are bad, - the Soviet Union and developing countries are good. And they are never alone. - Move to the US. I hate them even more. Who'd you ring if you could call anyone? - Definitely not you. Why not? - You ain't got no phone. I don't go for them. People talk on the phone without emotion. How can you talk when you can't see who you're talkin' to? Your mates, eh? Take this? Rattori is the hottest club in Oulu. You can't let immature brats come screamin' in there. We ain't whosoever. I'm the most interesting songwriter - this country's ever seen. - Take it yourself? You're the one hangin' around with Ana. Could I stay over night? - How about growin' up first? Teenage years excepted, I've always been an adult. Ana's bigger, is that it? That's what it's all about? Show me. Ana's bigger. Välde! This is Anki, and Välde. - Hi. We got the gig at Rattori. - Really? What the fuck! Support for Flash. - When!? Next weekend. Call Karhila and say we meet at seven to rehearse. Sasu ain't comin' today. To steam. - Tomorrow. You're Pike's sister? - That's your band? Seen those on every lamppost. What are you readin'? - Angelica. Bet you just read Dostoyevski, or somethin? - How come? I've heard you real good in writing essays. Oh yeah. I read other stuff too. Kafka and Mukka What kind of music d'you play? - A bit like Velvet Underground. Says nothing to me. Great hair. What was the band again? - Velvet Underground. Say hi to Pike. What did he say? - Who? Välde. - Nothing. He gave you somethin'. What's it? - Nothing. Who we're waitin' for? - Nobody. We're on. Great Sasu! Fuck yeee! We're Tart! - Wow Tart! Just dumped a tart myself! - Shut the fuck up, you faggot! Come here and say that! Our first song's called Cooper Test. Runnin', runnin', this is Cooper Test. Runnin' slow on tartan, - Heikinoja checks the time on his watch... How do you know them? - I don't. Gotta try to catch someone, try to be some kind of man. Better than nothin'. If not good, at least some kind of man. Better than nothin'. I ain't runnin' in your shit race. What the hell are you doin'? Not interested in those statues on de roof. I ain't listenin' when you're yellin' - and I dodge away when you strike. Runnin', runnin'. This is Cooper Test. Cooper was a Nazi, a sergeant major in the marines... That went fuckin' great! Or what? - Yeah. But Ana left half way through the gig. During the Miss Blue Jeans song, a piece of shit anyways. You're a poet. You're in an art school, are you? - No. Come to Liminka. That's where you find a human being. What are you doin'? - You taken them? My tights. - What? And my mascara! We ain't taken nothin'. What's gonna happen to them liars again? You said yourself there's no such thing as hell. People die and there's just an announcement in the paper. It's meant to be a new kind of Bowie. We want to listen! And you guys had somethin' to say? - Nazi. Thank you. Välde, hi. You're at home? Er, is Pike there? Did you give Pike the flyer then? Yeah, but she's gone to Henri's cabin. What are they doin' there? Ain't none of my business, I guess. How old are you? - Thirteen. I've been to the library. Wanna have some juice? - Yeah. We got beer as well. - No thanks. Don't tell Pike I've been here. So she don't get no ideas. - No, of course not. If you want it you can get it. We gotta keep our own style. We got one. - Our style. Like what we agreed. If you're askin' me--. - No one's askin' you. So Cooper Test is good but stuff like Miss Blue Jeans... The same if the guy sings with his eyes shut. Those lyrics happen to mean a lot to me. How do you think people can... - Oh shutthefuckup! You said exactly... - Just shutthefuckup!! Who's done this? Disco Datsun. Kai's got a nice Disco Datsun, he parades it around. Decorated Disco Datsun, - bass drum kicks the beat. This is hard core... Found my way real easy. Saturday same time? Sasu? - Yeah, yeah. I see you're judging me. My clothes and my watch and all. It's gonna all change but it'll take some time. Is Pike back home yet? Ain't heard no sounds of fuckin' for some time now. Henri, Dad is comin' to help. Do not shout there, we men fix this. How about gettin' ladders? We men don't need ladders. Be careful not to break it! - It's notgonna break! Heya. You wanted somethin'? - Yeah. Show me what you can play. Could you hold me close a moment. Would you hold me like the earth that rustles quietly. The motorway is there, - a criss crossing string of light. Trucks swallowed by darkness. Keep goin'. Sounds good. What's this? You got a good touch, but a shit band. These Flash guys play better than they sing. I figured you two could join forces. I got a band already. Flash's gonna play at Kuusrock. We gotta get somethin' done here! More gigs! New songs and a demo. You're with me? Yeah if you stop kicking these. ...and eight hundred. Could you give the boys a hand with the truck? As it is payday... Let's call. These must have cost a fortune. - In instalments. You could gimme a hand, you know. Anki's gonna be in the band. Doing what? - Er, singing. And me then? - You can play bass. Maybe this is the one? - Limminranta. Thanks. Hi Partsu. You're busy? When I open my eyes and see you there so close to me, - so warm you are there next to me. Thanks Kaitsu. What are you doing here? Pike! Go away! We only gonna play some CCR and Stones in Kuusrock, er? What else? - You said yourself I'm good with words. We can try sometime, eh. Now we goes ahead with these. Why don't you talk to him? - You're so impatient. Why? - My songs are better. Better than the Rolling Stones? Can I borrow your mascara? There you go. We didn't have nothing. It's you he loves just like all the rest of them! One song, Pauli. Otherwise it's all useless. I know you like to play my songs. One. - Ana's gonna have a fit. Oh hidihow, and uupsie daisy honey bunnies. Now start movin an' lift your butts off the grass. Come 'n see what's happenin' up on the stage. A local band, the monster of your home town - FLASH! Välde! We were in the same class, ain't it right? I'm your new rock 'n roll idol!! Our first track is Miss Blue Jeans. What the fuck!? Miss Blue Jeans, let's go crazy, - go loud mouthin' to the morons, and then we run away. Miss Blue Jeans, - let's go crazy, disappear before you go to London, - before you're on the cover of the magazine. Saw you puttin' eye shadow on in front of the mirror, - got all stuck up, couldn't help it. Saw you try on a tank top at your home. Ana! Folks like it. Miss Blue Jeans, you are the queen. Your hands make art when you light a fag. Every guy is waiting, your move, - but you hold still. You ask for a fag. That's a sign for me to follow you through the night. Wherever you go, can't help it. That's a sign for me to follow you through the night. You're one true crazy girl. Miss Blue Jeans, let's go crazy. Miss Blue Jeans, let's get deeper. Miss Blue Jeans, let's run into an icy lake. Miss Blue Jeans. Brown Sugar? My next song tells - what kind of stuff a horny stud could see at the school gate. KEEP GOIN'! - Okey lads! I saw you at the school gate havin' a fag with others. You looked so fine, I'd no guts to stare... I said please God give her to me, so I will believe in you. That was in the autumn, and the leaves were yellow. ...Kaitsu drives in the frosty night. You know this Pike who's got hearts on her rivet belt... ...could you hold me for a while next to you? ...that's a sweet baby, she's gotta divine body for sure. ...if I ever want a love of my own... Let's run the Cooper Test... ...I saw you at the school... ...havin' a fag with others. You looked so fine... ...could you hold me like the earth that rustles quietly. The motorway in there, criss crossing strips of light. The trucks are swallowed by darkness... ...this is just teenage dreaming... Could you describe your music? Is it punk? Oh Välde!! I couldn't believe! Excuse me. How old are you? Excuse me, could I get in! I really gotta get inside. You gotta queue. Just like everybody else. No really, please let me get in. Fuck you bitch, get in the queue. Who do you think you are? Välde!! -Hurray Välde-Välde!!! Välde, gimme an interview! Pike! Heya. How you doin'? - Guess alright. We're on our way to a jazz dance competition. And you? I heard you quit school? - Yeah. Heard it from Marja-Leena. I'm still in sixth form. And your band is called Välde now? Not Flash anymore. - Right. Yeah, changed it. It was a stupid name anyway. Välde is better. Gotta come an' listen some time. I was there at Kuusrock, in summer. Well ok, see you then, eh. It's workin' now? - Let's try it. Hello? - Happy birthday. I can hear real well. - I am going now. Bye. Mauno Raappana. - This is Välde, Pike's old school friend. Could you ask Pike to call me back? - She's in Kemi. If she could gimme a ring when she gets back home. I'll give you the number: 33454. - I'll tell her. Thanks a lot. You didn't come to the funeral. You could've come. There was a lot of folks from your class. You wanted to have some coffee? - No, thanks. Son of a bitch has become a big star. You gonna make a record, are you? To Helsinki, er? - Yup. Will you come back? Which one of us ordered Suicide? - You did. The rest are yours. Whatever you do, whatever you be, - the guitar is screaming and go go. You need help, you need help. What ever you do, what ever you be, revolting crowds and go go. You need help, you need help. You gotta rebel here, you gotta rock here. To the roaring heroes you gotta bow with starry eyes... How's guys? - Nothin'. I'm leavin'. - Yeah, we know. We read what you're doing from the papers. We read papers even if we don't have no tv. Want the guitar? - Can we have it? Yeah. See you. Välde! You're gonna get a good beatin' from your old man.- Already did. Be good. Call me when you get there. Buy something to eat from the dining car. Mum Thursday 28th March. They opened a first pizzeria in Oulu. Went for a meal with Marja-Leena. Food was a bit strange. My photo was in the magazine yesterday. Everybody says is our Pirjo gonna be Miss Blue Jeans. I think I'm in love.
