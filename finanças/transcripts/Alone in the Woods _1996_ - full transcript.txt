(upbeat comical music) - Justin, vaminos amigo. - [Justin] Coming! - [TV Announcer] Stay tuned. We'll be right back after these messages. - Hey kids. I'm Stu Stuart, president of Toytropolis, maker of many fine toy products including the hottest item this holiday season, our facilitator, the definitive lifeline for any young adventurer. - I got mine. - I just wanna wish each and every one of you the happiest of holidays and remember, when you're thinking toys, think Toytropolis. After all, you can never have enough toys. - Katie, could you see if the garage door was deadbolted? - No. - You go check? - No. - [Mom] Where's your suitcase? - I'm wearing this. - You know, I don't mean to criticize your new trend but don't you think you should bring at least one change of clothes? - If I do, can Collin come with us? - Katie, we've been through this. - Don't I know it. - You know, we like Collin a lot. He's a very unique young man. - Yeah, sweetheart, Collin should spend Thanksgiving with his family. - His family's dysfunctional. He's trapped inside a living hell. We need to help him. - He doesn't need help, he needs treatment. - Way to go, Dan. - This is gonna be good. - Sorry to rush you, buddy, but we're on a schedule. - Did you remember to set the burglar alarm, honey? - Don't worry, I got it covered. Oh, hold on, I gotta tie my shoe. - Okay kids, all set? - You bet. - Yippee. - Oh come on, sis. Where's your family spirit? You used to be such a happy little girl. - Shut up, dweeb. (air blowing) - Did you leave food for the lizard? - [Family] Howard. - No, you did. - Oh, that's right. (popping) (screaming) What was that? - What's so funny? - [Mom] What is it? - Gotcha! You guys should have seen your faces. - Why do you do these things, Justin? - 'Cause they're funny. - Young man, you're on probation. (upbeat music) (grunting) - Stop that, it's bugging me. (grunting) You're such a dork. - Slacker. - Get a life. - Take a shower. (grunting) - I said stop it! - [Dad] Hey, hey, knock it off. You want me to pull this car over? - Justin, stop bothering your sister! - She started it. - He's being a jerk! - Yeah right. - Just put a lid on it. - You put a lid on it! - Apologize to your mother, Justin. - No, I didn't do anything. - You wanna be grounded? - I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry for anything I've ever done. You guys cannot take a joke and she's weird and smells funny. I wish I wasn't here. I wish I was spending Thanksgiving by myself. - You really feel that way, Justin? - Yeah. (downbeat music) - I'm ready to fall asleep. I gotta stop and get a coffee. - I'm serious, Perry, I think you're addicted to caffeine and that scares me. - You know what scares me? Your face. - We have to stop at the mountain store. I forgot to get the cranberry sauce. - Can't do without cranberry sauce. - Man. (gentle music) Justin, are you coming? - [Male] Perry. You know, I wanna get some liquid. - Yeah, yeah, fine, there's a store up ahead. (downbeat music) Now let's make this snappy. We ain't got all day. Hey, hey, look at this, copy cats. What are you doing? - Hey, did you lock the patio door at home? - The answer is still yes. - You know, Perry, I've always been the bad person. I mean I got thrown out of nine different grade schools. I never even made it past seventh grade. - What are you talking about? I saw your eighth grade diploma hanging on your wall. - Yeah, they gave me an eighth grade so I would leave the school. Can you believe it? - [Perry] Some guys get all the luck. High school. Man, no kid should ever have to go through that. I don't care how rotten he is. - What I really wanted to say is you're like a hundred times badder than I am. - I try real hard, I do. - Well we finally made it. Here we are. Don't be shy about helping us unpack. - I've gotta call Collin, I can sense he needs me. - I get the sense he wants you to call him collect. The phone bill is gonna cost more than this trip. - Honey, she's in love and there's nothing we can do about it. - How could she be in love? She just met him two weeks ago. Justin, come on. Help us unpack. Hey buddy. Hey honey, did Justin go inside? - No. - He's not here, he's gone. - How can that be? - Must have gotten out at the store. - Oh my god, let's go. - I hope this isn't another one of his jokes. Katie! - What? - [Dad] We're going to the store to find Justin. He's missing. - That's the best news I've heard all week. - Just stay here in case he comes back. - And stay off the phone in case he tries to call. - Can I have the key? - Doormat. - Justin! Justin! - Nobody's seen him. - Well he's gotta be here somewhere. He can't have just disappeared. - He's just blowing off some steam. He's probably back at the cabin right now. He knows the way. - What if he's not? - We'll have to take it from there. - Ah, the great outdoors. There's nothing like it. - So what do you say? Build a campfire, make some s'mores, sing a song? Tell a joke, a song and then a joke? You gotta mix it up, right? - Ha ha. - [Male] Ah, the mountain makes me so giddy. - [Perry] Yeah, well you just keep it to yourself. (suspenseful music) - What a dump. - [Perry] I wanna order a pizza. - [Male] In this neck of the woods? Come on, there ain't a pizza parlor for a hundred miles. - [Perry] Maybe we're in a delivery area. Give me the cellphone. - Telephone. - You got a clip? Thanks. (knocking) Who knows we're here? - No one that I know of. Put that thing away and act casual but be ready to smack someone. - Thank you. (mumbling) - Excuse me but where did you come from? - Austria, I come here with my father. He make go go budget American movie. Ah, I see you have a telephone. I must use it now. I need call my father. - That is a cellular phone. It costs money to use that phone. You got money? - Give me quarter, I make dollar for you. - What do you mean make dollar? - Quarter, give me. - Whoa, look! Did you see this? - Telephone? - It's over there. Keep it under a minute. - Hey, give me 20 dollars. - What, are you crazy? - Come on, this kid could make us a lot of money. (beeping) - I know you're hurting. I'm here for you. - Arnold please. Papa, it is me. I am with my new friends. Yes, papa, I will be very nice. No, papa, I do not want to hurt them. Okay papa, see you soon. - [Perry] That was your pops? - Mm-hmm. - Dude, you mean to tell me your dad is-- - Mm-hmm. - Look kid, we'd love to have your company but we've got things we gotta do so why don't you run along? - You mean you won't let me stay? - No, now beat it. - Can you make a hundred out of this? - [Perry] What are you doing? - It is possible. Guess not. (groaning) - Can't beat up a kid. Look kid, it was nice meeting you but be a good kid and don't let our whereabouts be known, okay, we're here for rest and relaxation and do not wish to be bothered so why don't you go play with your bears. Are you nuts? (gentle music) - Where's that phone book? I can't find it anywhere. - You could be a brain surgeon and try 911. - Lose the sarcasm, Katie. - I'm not one to say I told you so but hey, I told you so. - Oh my god, what's this doing in the oven? - Do you think Justin will get mauled to death by a bear? - It's ringing. - [Officer] Sheriff's department. What can I do for you? - I wanna report a missing person, my son. This is Danny Rogers. I've got a cabin up on Quail Pass. - [Officer] Fooled you, huh? (laughing) We ain't around right now. Went to the big city for turkey day. We'll be back on Sunday. We hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Leave a message if you like. We'll be checking in. - What, what's wrong? - Sheriff's out of town. - How can the sheriff be out of town? - [Dad] That's what you get when you vacation in Mayberry. - Give me that. State police, please, it's an emergency. - [Female] Hold please. - [Officer] Station 42, may I help you? - Yes, I wanna report a missing child. - [Officer] When did you see him last? - The last time we saw him, this afternoon. - [Officer] Can't do anything about that-- - What do you mean you can't? - [Officer] He's gotta be missing for 24 hours. - That's ridiculous. - [Officer] Sorry, ma'am, that's standard procedure. Now if you wanna leave us with a number-- - Damn. - What? - He has to be missing 24 hours before he can be considered missing. - That's unbelievable. - Sarge, some woman just called and said her kid was missing. - Well did you tell her what the standard procedure is? - Sure did, standard procedure. And then she hung up on me. - Well ain't nothing we can about that. Besides, that's a county matter. - We promised Earl we'd cover for him this weekend, remember? I feel terrible, Sarge. What if the little fella's hurt? - Earl's 47, he can take care of himself. - No, I mean the missing kid. Anything can happen out there in the woods. - Would you quit griping? Why don't you spend the energy on something more useful like getting this place cleaned up. (beeping) Oh, Betty will have my butt. - I've been meaning to, Sarge. I just didn't get to it today. I didn't have time-- - You can start tomorrow. I want the floors mopped and the windows washed and see if you can't find them festive Christmas lights and string 'em up. This is a holiday season. We should show some seasonal spirit. - Right, Sarge. Good night. - What's on your shirt there? Ho, gotcha! (ripping) Oh, that boy's dumb as a box of rocks. (mysterious music) (wolf howling) - [Perry] Kurt, what are you doing? Will you come on already? We ain't got all night. - [Kurt] I'm coming, I'm coming. - [Perry] Enough with the packing. Come on, let's go, will you please? Come on! - [Kurt] Okay. - [Perry] Here, I'm driving. - [Kurt] No, I want to drive now. - [Perry] No, I'm driving. You're lucky I'm even talking to you. - [Justin] Tight security. - I'm never gonna get any sleep tonight until we find him, you know that, don't you? - You think I will? - Justin, we're back. Are you here? I feel so helpless. - All we can do is keep looking. We'll get an early start tomorrow. - We can put up some mug shots. - That's a good idea, Kate. We'll drop some pictures off at the mountain store. Hey mom, how you doing? - Do you think we were too hard on him? - I hope not. I hope not. You know Justin, he'll be fine. (gun firing) (trumpet playing) (suspenseful music) Nothing like a good short sheeting. Uh-oh. (owl hooting) Dad, turn off the TV, I'm trying to ... - [Perry] Give me a hand with this. - I can't, I have a bad back. - Mayday, mayday. - You're unbelievable, you know that? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. The door's open. (mumbling) Perry, take it easy with the merchandise, okay? - Must have been that foreign kid. - Yeah, he's probably still here. Goldilocks. Papa bear is home. And he's got some porridge for you. - Porridge? Wait a minute. All the TV dinners are accounted for. Come on, let's take care of business. (gentle music) (radio static) - [Announcer] We interrupt this broadcast for a special report. Chelsea Stuart, daughter of billionaire toy magnate, Stu Stuart, was kidnapped late last night from St. Mary's Academy Boarding School for Girls. Two suspects were spotted leaving the scene in a white minivan. And now back to our top three billboard countdown. (suspenseful music) - Now you promise to be quiet and I'll remove that gag. You promise? - The man asked you a question, sister? - Put her in the chair. - Here goes nothing. - Now we wanna be hospitable, little girl, we really do. - That's right. - But we're gonna get what we want and we're not gonna play games. - [Kurt] That's right. - Now you cooperate and you won't get hurt. You don't, you will. - That's right. - Is that all you can say? - That's right. - Alright. I'm gonna remove this, be quiet. (knocking) - Are we expecting someone? - Ah geez, I knew it, it's that annoying kid. - Well let's pretend we're not here. - He already saw us. - I'm so sorry! - Alright, come on, come on, come on. Get your hands off him. What do you want? - I want to say sorry! I stole your money yesterday and I feel so bad! Here, here it is! I don't want it and I don't need it. - Give it to me, it's mine. - Wait a minute, Perry, it's my money. - What do you mean, I gave it to you. - That's why it's mine. - I didn't say for keeps. - You fight over it! I not want it! - Gimme! Gimme! - [Kurt] Nope, it's mine, give me that. - Gimme! You're a bully, you know that? - I not wish to cause problem. - Yeah, right, good, now beat it. What, go! - May I ask large favor, please? - No! - Pretty please? - Negative. - Pretty please with gobs and gobs of Swedish meatballs and wienerschnitzels? (groaning) I need to use restroom. - Okay, last room all the way down the hall but don't get lost. - Thank you. - Hey, you think I can ask his dad for an autograph? He's famous. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Happy holidays from station 42. May I help you? - Morning, Ethel. (screaming) - Is that a fact? (banging) I'll call you back. Sarge. Sarge. (slamming) - How many times have I told you to keep the files all closed? - Sorry, Sarge, it was an accident. - Hit the head on that. Will you stop cleaning me, boy? Stop cleaning me! Here, get back to work. - Sorry, Sarge. Hey, (mumbling) just called from channel three. He said they got a fax of that missing child this morning. The mother must have phoned the papers too. - Damn, that's all I need. A bunch of panicky parents trying to take matters into their own hands. Alright, make the usual calls and put it out over the wire. - Yes sir! (smacking) (gasping) (slamming) - Oprah or Jenny Jones? - Price is Right. - Cartoons? - That works. (suspenseful music) - Sh, I'm here to help you. - You're here to help me? Who are you? - Rogers, Justin Rogers. You're Chelsea Stuart. I heard the story on the radio. I know all about it. - Where are we, Justin? - That's a good question. See, I'm lost. - You're lost? - Shh. - How can you help me if you're lost? - Well I kind of know where we are. We're in the Timberland National Forest. - The Timberland National Forest? Timberland National Forest is huge! - Can you pull your arm out? - [Announcer] We interrupt this program for a special late breaking report. A young boy is missing in the Timberland National Forest. (laughing) This marks the first reported disappearance in the park since last-- - People get lost in this forest and never come out. - Don't you think your current situation is a little bit more dangerous? - Yeah I guess. - [Announcer] Justin Rogers wandered off yesterday afternoon at the mountain grocery store. The store is located-- - Probably dead by now. - Yep, coyote food. (laughing) - [Announcer] Here is a recent photo of the boy. (spitting) If you have any info on his whereabouts, please contact your local authorities. If you are in the Quail Pass region, the number to call is 1-800-881-059-- - Got one. - [Perry] Come out, you little freak! - You're dead meat, kid, we know who you are! - He ain't in there. (shouting) (banging) - What are you doing? - It's a transmitter so we can talk to each other. - Ram, ram it, ram it! Come here, let me in there! (banging) - What are you doing? - I know you're in there, kid! You delinquent, I'm coming in! - Keep that free hand out of sight! Bye! (slamming) (groaning) - Excuse me, would you mind getting off of me, please? Now? - Oh, sorry. - We do appreciate all you're doing. It's not that at all. - [Sarge] We're doing everything we can, ma'am. - Tell them it's been almost 24 hours. - They're aware of that, honey. No, no, I didn't call you honey. I was talking to my husband. As you can understand, we're just very worried about our son. - [Sarge] I understand totally. - Couldn't you send somebody up here just a little sooner. (mumbling) That would be wonderful. - [Sarge] Just stay calm. - We will. Thank you so much. - [Dad] What? - They'll have a trooper up here by this evening. - I'll believe that when I see it. We'd better get moving. - Thank you, sweetheart. We'll be back as soon as we run out of flyers. - Hold down the fort, Katie. - Aye aye. - Lyle, I want you to call Andy and tell him to get his big butt in here. I need somebody go over there to Quail Pass and do a report on that missing kid. - Andy's big butt is in Florida visiting his pap. Sarge, maybe I can-- - [Sarge] Call Fred then. - He's in Reno. - Well how about Frank or Sisco? - They're still in Frisco? - Damn. I got no extra men. I need somebody to go over there and get a report on that kid. - I could go! Sarge, I know I only been here a few months but I really feel I'm ready to take the next step and get some field experience. (zapping) - Oh lord. (swinging) (screaming) (plopping) Lyle, I believe I will let you take that report 'cause it's about the only way I can think of to keep me out of intensive care! - Fugitive to prisoner. Are you there? - I'm here. - [Justin] Are they still mad? - Well they've calmed down a bit. At least they stopped screaming at each other. How are you? - Okay. I made a campfire. - [Chelsea] You did? Are you roasting marshmallows? - Pine cones, I'm out of marshmallows. I'm getting pretty hungry. - Me too. I think they're cooking dinner. I could save some for you. - Thanks but that's too risky for right now. I've gotta come up with a plan. I'll talk to you in a few hours. Fugitive out. - Fried chicken or Salisbury steak? - Steak. Let me see the box, please. Give me the other one. - No, you said steak, this is chicken. This is mine. - I just wanna see something. Come on, come on. - What are you doing? You're gonna break 'em. - Good, they're 31 grams of fat in there. - What? - I retain fats. - You what? - I retain fats, I have a slow metabolism, alright? I eat them at bed, I'm a cream puff. - Oh come on, they're not gonna kill you. - But I told you to get me some non-fat stuff. - Well they were out of it. - [Kurt] No they weren't, you forgot. - Alright, I forgot. - Because you don't care. Why should you? You don't care about your body. Why should you care about mine? - Fine. Starve yourself. I'll eat 'em all. I like fat! - Give me the keys, I'm going to the store. - Eat the TV dinners! - I can't! - Alright, alright! Alright. Hey, grab some of those chocolate eclair cookies if they got 'em there, please. (crickets chirping) - He doesn't understand me. (comical music) - Be cheerful but serious, helpful but businesslike, understanding but not namby pamby, neutral but intense and lastly, knowledgeable but modest. Now you got that, Lyle? - Yes sir. Chunk. - What? - Cheerful, helpful, understanding, neutral, and knowledgeable. That spells chunk. Helps me remember. - Right. Chunk. (upbeat music) - Okay. Folks, looks like I got all I need. - Now we've already alerted the media and we'll keep searching too. If you like, we can give you a map of the areas we've already covered. Well? - Ma'am, let us handle this. - Well at least we got 'em out here. - Congratulations my good man. How does it feel to have a free five minute shopping spree? Great, thanks. I think it's a good way for true savings and to avoid comparison shopping. Well, on your marks, ready, set, go. Let's see, what do we have here. Ah, breakfast foods. 99% fat free, see? Perry? - Please develop these pictures of the kidnappers. Thanks, Justin. - Oh, this should be good for my skin. (whistling) Well how do you expect me to pay for all of this? Oh, you want to pay me for shopping here? Thanks. (dinging) Figures, figures, figures. Oh, what do we have here? A camera? (laughing) Suckers! You know, I like this place. I think I'm gonna go shop here again. Thank you, sorry about the door! - Maybe we should do one more sweep before bedtime. - The trooper said we shouldn't be out searching. - So he can arrest me. - Mom, dad! - Oh honey! Are you alright? We were so worried about you, you okay? - You guys have to listen to me! Kate, why are you hugging me? - Sorry, I forgot myself. - You guys gotta listen to me. There is this girl and she got kidnapped and-- - Just a second. We should call the state police and tell 'em he's here. - You guys gotta listen to me. Okay, you might not believe this but it's true. Yesterday when we stopped at the store, I got out of our van to get some gumballs but instead of getting back into our van, I got into a van that looked just like ours but it belonged to these two kidnappers. One guy's really short and he talks really fast and the other guy's about 10 feet tall and I spent the night at their place last night but this morning they kidnapped this girl and her dad owns Toytropolis and we have to save her. - Liar, liar, pants on fuego. - I'm not lying. - So this guy's 10 feet tall? That's pretty tall. - I didn't measure him. He's just really tall, buttface. - That's enough, Justin. I think it's time for bed. - [Justin] No! - Yes, go to your room! - Why don't you believe me? We have to save her! - No more nonsense, Justin. You are grounded. You've been nothing but a headache all weekend. Now go to your room and don't come out until we tell you to come out. - What in the hell are you doing, Lyle? - Waltzing. Taking Shirley to a dance on Sunday. Could you do me a favor, Lyle? Could you pick up that pencil? I dropped it. (ripping) - Oh no. (laughing) - What happened? Did you tear your pants again, Lyle? (phone ringing) 42, how can I help you? - [Danny] This is Danny Rogers. - Oh, hello, Mr. Rogers. How are things in your neighborhood? (laughing) Quite a joke, huh? - [Danny] Funny. - [Sarge] I'm sorry, I'm just a little full of the devil tonight. - [Danny] Justin came home. - [Sarge] Oh he did, did he? - [Danny] Yes. - Well hold on, let me get a pencil so I can cancel the search. (whistling) Well that's great news, Mr. Rogers. Yeah, we're real pleased that the little brat, uh, (mumbling) is back. (whoopee cushion rumbling) (laughing) Uh, no sir, I meant no disrespect. - [Danny] Then what was that? - Don't know what that was. - [Danny] Are you making fun of me? - Uh, no sir, I'm not making fun of you. If we can be of any further service to you during the rest of your vacation, you please call us. (laughing) Shut up. The little Rogers boy is back home safe again. - I sure did get you back good, didn't I, Sarge? - I hate it when you do that! - I sure did get you good, didn't I? (splatting) - Lord, give me strength with this child. - [Danny] Maybe we shouldn't have put him on probation. - I don't know where he gets this stuff. Just seems so out there. - He's back, he's in bed. We'll worry about it tomorrow. (comical music) - [Justin Voiceover] Dear mom, dad, and Kate. I'm sorry I have to do this because I know you're gonna be mad but Chelsea needs help and I promise I'll be careful but if I don't come back, I'm sorry in advance for all the trouble I've caused you. Love Justin. Very special. Best Stuf Glue. Cool. - Boy, do I have plans for you. Chelsea, are you awake? - Yeah, where are you? - I can't reveal that in case someone's eavesdropping. - [Chelsea] I understand. Are you okay? - Yeah, are you? - No, I've been kidnapped! Did you find some food? - Yeah, my mom made me dinner. - You saw your parents? - [Justin] Yeah, I went back to our cabin. - Well did you tell them? - [Justin] I tried to. - [Chelsea] What'd they say? - Looks like we're alone in the woods on this one, Chelsea. - I'm not playing games, does it sound like I'm playing games? Don't tell me you ain't got that kind of money. All you rich millionaires got it hidden around. No, I won't take a gift certificate to Toytropolis. I want one million dollars in unmarked bills by three tomorrow or she dies, that's that. - I really hate that kid. - What? I said three, are you deaf? Three, three, three! Oh, sorry, p.m. (upbeat music) - He owns 500 toy stores. He's gotta have the cash. - Sure, sure, he's got it. He's just toying with us. Granted, we're in a recession year and many consumers are reluctant to spend rather than maintain some degree of fiscal solvency, but Stu Stuart's got a lot and I want a piece of it. - What if he don't pay? - We're men of our word, we whack her. Why, you got a problem with that? - No. - Good 'cause I don't. I'd rather be a cowardly sociopathic, morally bankrupt murderer than a hypocrite. It's important to me. A man's gotta keep his word. (horn blaring) What was that? Quick, go see what it was. - You find out, I gotta hit the head. - I don't see nothing. Whoa! - First boob trapped. (laughing) - You bum. (shouting) Perry! I need some TP! - That kid. (dramatic music) - We have ignition, Houston. (flare firing) - What an unusual sound. Uh-oh. (yelling) - Bullseye. - [Kurt] Oh, my ass! My ass! - Hey, hey! Wait, wait! Holy gee! - Stop (mumbling), Perry. - [Perry] Your butt's smoking! - We don't have much time. - What was all that screaming? - It's the big guy. He is not in a good mood. - [Kurt] Do something, do something! - They're coming! - Yes! Front door. Jump the porch, it's rigged. - Hey, come back here! (shouting) You run away, kid! You're signing your own death warrant! I guarantee it! - [Kurt] I guarantee it myself! - Honey, Thanksgiving's a day to be thankful. - I am thankful, there's not one but two good football games on today. - Well, I thought we'd spend the day together as a family. - Agreed, call the kids. They'll miss the opening kickoff. (laughing) - That's not funny. - [Reporter] And now an eyewitness news flash. The search continues for 16 year old Chelsea Stuart, daughter of billionaire toy magnate Stu Stuart. She was kidnapped a day and a half ago from St. Mary's Academy Boarding School. Here's a photograph of the suspects taken by an anonymous photographer known only as Justin. - [Both] Justin? - Justin, get up. - Oh my God. - [Katie] Look, he left a note. - I know this sounds outrageous but the fact is he's gone again and he left a note saying he's going to rescue this Chelsea Stuart. - [Sarge] You're pulling my leg, ain't you, Mr. Rogers? - No, I'm serious. What do you think I am, a liar? - [Sarge] Hey, there ain't no reason to get rude about it. - Give me the phone. Hi, this is Ms. Rogers. Yes, like we told the officer that came last night-- - [Sarge] Won't you be my neighbor? (laughing) - Won't I be your neighbor? - [Sarge] Sorry, couldn't resist that one. - Oh. Oh yes, that's very funny. - [Sarge] Bet you never heard that one. - Yeah, no, I never heard that one before. I'm sorry I'm lacking in sense of humor. It's just that I think my son may be in a great deal of danger. - [Sarge] Well Mr. Rogers said he had a whopping imagination. - Yes, I know my husband told you that Justin has a big imagination but I'm really sure that he is not making this up. - [Sarge] Sorry ma'am, I don't have anybody to send out there right now. - Well when can you have someone up here? - [Sarge] It's Thanksgiving weekend, Ms. Rogers. - Yes, I know it's Thanksgiving. - [Sarge] Well then you know half my guys are off celebrating. - Listen, we pay our taxes, we obey the speed limit. We watch COPS. How about sending someone up here right now? - [Sarge] Hey, don't have a cow on me, ma'am. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just a little tense. - [Sarge] Well as soon as possible we'll make-- - Yes, oh, yes, as soon as possible would be absolutely wonderful. Thank you. - The kid's gone again. Damn it, Lyle, you are a magnet for disaster. Get your stuff, you're going back to Quail Pass. - Right, sarge. - You're not going like that are you? Get over here. I'll help you pull it off. I want you to call Emmitt at 38 and tell him we might need some of his men for a search party. - Right. - Hey, hey, sit on the table. Alright, put your foot in my chest. In my chest! Alright, on three, you ready? One, two, three. (screaming) Oh! - It's stuck to my chest hairs. - I have absolutely no response to that. - I want you to drive up and down the road. That's their only easy way out. And then I'm gonna call in the secret weapon. - The secret weapon? - The tracker. - Who's the tracker? - No one really knows. But he can sniff a mouse fart from outer space. I'll never forget the first time I ever met the tracker. It was many years ago. I hired him to do a little investigative work for me. He possessed a keen sense of smell and an uncanny knack for finding things. He also had a very complicated wrist watch. He was a master of the unexpected. He searched for what seemed like an eternity until my closet could yield no more. I was worried. No, pensive. But the tracker came through for me. I probably wouldn't recognize him today but he'll get them back and fast. He's gonna cost us. But it'll be worth it. - Oh yeah, it'll be worth it. - Okay, we got about three hours til sundown. Let's get to it. Kate, you got the map? - Sir, yes sir. - [Danny] Come on, hurry up, let's go. - [Katie] Stop it, dad. Woo! - [Mom] Honey, take it easy. - Chelsea. I'm pretty sure but I'm not totally sure that we're going in the right direction. - I thought you did? - So did I but when I came up here last time, I took the main road. This is different. I'm kind of confused. - It's okay, Justin. I have no clue where we are either. Do you remember what direction the highway is? - West. - [Chelsea] Let me see your facilitator, the radio. - Why? - We need the compass. - What compass? Whoa, how did you know that? - My dad tested it out on me when they were researching it. One of the developers told me about the secret compass. - You got to test toys? - Well I lived away from home since I was 10. Prep schools. Almost every day there'd be something new on my doorstep to play with. - Every day? Dominators? - Twice a week. Die-bots, video games from the Valkyrie system. You name it, I had it. I have toys that haven't even come out yet. - You're a luck out. - Guess so. - Thank god he had the sense to take the tent. - You see anything? - Not yet. - I see a lot of trees. - Let's try another road. Kate, mark this one off. - It's gonna be dark soon. - Perry. I can't believe the kid short sheeted the bed. I feel so violated. I'm so stressed out I can't sleep. - Tell me about it. You just can't kidnap like you used to anymore. There's always some fly in the ointment messing up the whole bowl of wax. - Perry. My butt is killing me. (suspenseful music) Are you the tracker? - I am. - The same tracker that uncovered (mumbling) 72 Chevy Impala 20 years after it disappeared from the Bakersfield, California Rotary Club parking lot? - The same. - What color was it? - White with a black vinyl roof. Rally pin stripes, pewter interior. - Let's make a deal. - Alright. - Alright. (mumbling) seasoned steel belted radios. Sheep skinned seat covers, pine tree deodorizer. 16 head of corn fed cattle. One pregnant sow? Flannel bedsheets. Is that all? - You forgot something. - Oh yeah. 15 cases of diet cola. - Caffeine free. - [Perry] The bottom yellow copy is yours. Hey. Blanket. - We had her wrapped in there for four hours. (sniffing) - You are one weird hombre. - Don't judge me because of my super advanced olfactory nerves. - Ol-what? - We're gonna split up into two groups. I'm gonna go this way by myself. Kate, you take your mom in the car and make sure she remembers she's eight months pregnant. - Roger, Mr. Rogers. - We're gonna meet back here every 30 minutes. We're gonna keep this up until the police search rescue team comes, alright? Ready? - Honey, be careful. - You too. Get some rest when you need to. Justin, Justin! (dramatic music) - Sarge, ain't we a little far away from the group. - That's the whole point of spreading out, Lyle. We can cover more ground that way. - Oh. - Speaking of which, why don't you go off down over there and I'll go up off over this way. - But then I'd be alone. - That's the general idea. Don't worry, we'll connect up later somewhere down the road. - Hello, little lost boy? (groaning) I'm stuck! (screaming) - What are you doing? - I'm stuck, can you help me? - Did you say you needed help? Hang on! - I can't! - We're almost home! - [Lyle] I'm so tired! - You can reach! Yeah! Let's go! Come on, come on! - Lyle! Hey, Lyle, what the hell is going on here? - Oh nothing, Sarge. This nice gentleman just saved me. - All in a days work, amigo. - We're looking for a missing kid. You didn't happen to see one, did you? - Kid, blonde hair, about 10 years old? About yay high? - Exactly. - Nope, can't say that I have, sorry. - Huh, well. If you happen to run up on him, you'll give us a call, won't you? - Sure. - Come on, Lyle. Let's go back to the office. It's getting late and we'll get another run at it tomorrow. - Thanks, mister. - You got any candy bars left? - No, we're out. My parents are gonna kill me. - Aren't you tired? - Yeah but I think we should keep going. - What? - I thought I heard something. (honking) The highway! - I can see it! (shouting) (groaning) - That wasn't very nice! (groaning) - Justin, you gotta run! - I'm not gonna leave you! - [Chelsea] Go, run, get away! - Leave her alone! - Just doing my job, sparky. - Well you have to get past me first, dirt bag. - [Perry] You think you're pretty cool, don't you? - Lay off him, you cretin! - Shut up, brat. Hey Justin, you always wanted to hang with us. Well now here's your chance. (laughing) (phone ringing) Give me that. Yeah. You gonna play ball with me, hotshot? Good, you're smarter than I thought you were. You get the coordinates for the air drop? Alright, now remember. If the law shows up, she dies. - Justin! - Justin! - Justin! - Justin! We're never gonna find him, mom. We've been driving around for two hours yelling our heads off. - Well we can't give up, Kate. We'll find him. - Needle in a haystack, mom. - [Mom] Honey, pick that up. You know how I feel about littering. - I didn't drop it. It's Justin's handwriting. Mom, it's a map. - Look kid, while Kurt and I are in Bermuda lying in a bed of a million dollars, I'll be thinking of you hanging here, starving, crying like a baby. Then I'll eat a plate of nachos and I'll laugh. (laughing) Well, it's been fun but we got a money drop in the clearing and a plane to catch. See you around. - Later, dude. - You'll be okay, Justin. I'll get someone here to help you, I promise. (suspenseful music) - [Danny] Which way, right or left? - It's hard to tell. His drawing is really bad. - Pick one. - There it is. - Oh Justin! Oh, baby. You've got to stop doing this. I feel like I've got a thousand ulcers. - I'm sorry, mom, I'm really sorry. - No, no, I'm the one that's sorry. I'm sorry we didn't listen to you. - Mom, the kidnappers took Chelsea. - Oh my god. - You have to help me save her. - Baby, I'm not the bionic woman. - Mom, please? - Katy, I need you to stay here and call the police. - But I wanna help. - Do what your mom says, that's how you can help. Tell them where we're going. - Where are you going? - The clearing. - The clearing. - Brilliant, no phone. - Have a seat. I said sit. - There she is right on time. Yes siree, there's nothing like the smell of racks of money in the morning. - Ain't that beautiful? - Is this seat taken? It's the hat, isn't it? Sorry. - Perry, five bucks I can catch it. - You're on. Sheesh. - You're uptight, I understand, of course. I mean we didn't exactly meet under ideal circumstances, did we? (laughing) I guess what I'm really trying to say is I'm vulnerable, vulnerable but ready. I'm an open book, aren't I? Do you like opera? I love opera. - I have a boyfriend, we're pretty serious. - Okay. - Hey Kurt! Your socks are untied. - What socks? (groaning) (laughing) - Look. You ever get lonely or you ever just feel like talking, as friends of course, have a cappuccino maybe or a latte, call me and my beeper number's on there or feel free to drop me a fax. - Jackpot. Come on. Let's go. Take this. Alright girly, let's beat it. - You spaz's got what you wanted, let me go. - Do I look like a total moron? Don't answer that. You're gonna be our million dollar insurance policy. Hey, hey, watch it with the money. - And you're sure this is the only road coming out of here? - Yeah, pretty sure. Did we have a plan? - Yeah, I've got an idea. - [Justin] Alright mom! - [Mom] Okay, here's what we're gonna do. - Hello. Baker one nine, this is radical chick. I've got an emergency. Hello, is anybody there? Breaker breaker. I repeat, I have an emergency situation. Hello? Hello? 10-4 on a 10-20. (mumbling) - Lyle, what the hell? - My leg's asleep! - [Katie] Hello? I'm wearing a bikini. Hello? - [Mom] Okay, here they come. Yoo-hoo, hi, hello! Over here! Hi! - What the hell? - Hi. We have a flat and we don't know how to fix it. - We'd really appreciate your help. - How dumb can you be? - We're really sorry to trouble you but we're from the city, we're not from around here and we don't know what we're doing and I shouldn't lift anything heavy. - Justin! - Shh. - This is a jack. It is used to raise the vehicle so you can change the tire. It goes like so. - Oh! You know, I always wondered what those little things were. Now what does this thing do? - It loosens the nuts, lady. - What are nuts? - You know much about cars? - I used to work at Sears for a couple of years. Tune ups, tire changes, shoe department. - I'm having a little trouble with my gas cap. Wanna look at it for me? - [Tracker] Sure. - [Danny] It's been making a strange rattling noise. - [Perry] Hey, give me that. What a banana. - [Justin] Come on, follow me. - Ah, what you got here is a loose gas cap. Ow. - Time's a-wasting, let's get going. Look, lady, I'm sorry but we cannot teach you the most fundamental task in the automotive world. - Wait, I think there's something wrong with the motor. - [Perry] Lady, I told you, we gotta get going. - Alright everybody, hold it. You, come over here. Yeah, you. Drop it. I said drop it! - [Perry] Kurt, what's going on? - We've been tricked, that's what. - Oh well, I don't know what you're talking about. - Come over here, come, come. - [Danny] Hey, take it easy. - Of all the dirty things. Wait a minute, I smell a rotten egg. Where's the kid? - [Mom] What kid? - Hey kid! You better come out or we're gonna blow a hole in your mother! - Wait, don't shoot! - Ah! You thought you had us! Well you thought wrong, pipsqueak. - No, please sir, don't kill my mom. She's very sick and she doesn't have many months left. We're hoping she'll make it through the birth. - You're full of it, kid, she ain't sick. - No, really, she's got hypercalisthenia, a very debilitating and contagious disease. (coughing) - [Perry] What are you waiting for? Waste her! - Nice try, kid, you're dead. - Don't you think you're gonna need this? - [Kurt] Hey, don't do that! - Alright, nobody move! - Uh-oh. - Get over there, get over there, get over there! You didn't account for this now did you, smart boy? Huh, you think I'd be stupid enough to leave the house without my gun? The question is who am I gonna shoot first? Engine, engine, number nine. Going down Chicago line. If the train goes off the tracks, do you want your money back? Y-E-S spells yes and you are not the-- - Alright Kate! - Alright, let her go, you creep. One false move and you'll become just another victim of an angry teenager. - [Justin] We did it! - [Danny] We sure did, son. - [Katie] You okay, mom? - [Mom] I'm fine, sweetie. - Major bummer. I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy. They're the crazy ones. This is a postcard of a dysfunctional American family. - Have fun in prison! - Oh screw you. - Frankly, your son's an ass, he has no manners! You people must live in a barn! Secondly, we'll be back, just you wait! Hey, watch it. (sniffing) - I can't smell anything! - I hate you, you miserable little punk, I hate you! (screaming) (laughing) - Is he coming? - Supposedly. - Gumball? - Thanks. You know something, Justin? You're really lucky. Not many kids' parents would do what yours did today. - Yeah. I guess not. - Something to think about. He's here! - Whoa! - Hi hon. You alright? You need to see a doctor or anything? - No, I'm fine, really. - I'm so relieved you're safe. - It's good to see you, dad. - I got here as quick as I could. And you, young man. I don't know how to thank you. But I think I do know how to make it up to you. I see you like the facilitator XL model. - It's my favorite! - It's yours and any other model you want. All the toys you can cram into your house. I'll get a mack truck and you can fill it. - That's very generous, Mr. Stuart, but I think Justin has enough toys already. - No, really, he's mistaken. - Come on. You can never have enough toys. - Very well put, Stu. - Justin. I'm Sherry Rogers. - Stu Stuart, good to meet you. - Danny Rogers. - [Stu] Pleasure. - I'm Kate. - Very nice to meet you. Well what do you say, Justin? - Well sir, I think my dad's right. I'm pretty well stocked in the toy department. I know it sounds weird but I'd really like something else. - What's that? - I'd like our families to have Thanksgiving together. - Oh honey. Thanksgiving was yesterday. - Well who says you can only be thankful one day a year. - Yeah, I think it would be real cool if we could all spend some time together. - I'd love that, Justin, I really would but unfortunately I'm short on time. Anything else, you name it. - I can't think of anything else. - Dad, please? - [Stu] You have the extra space? - We'll make room. - I'll get your mother on the first plane out. (mumbling) It's me. Cancel all my meetings, I won't be in til Monday. No buts, cancel them. Come on, kids ride with me in the limo. We'll follow you. - Your dad seems really cool. - He's getting there. - Chelsea, I've decided something. I'm not gonna put myself up for adoption. - I think that's a good idea. Thanks for saving me. You're a way cool kid. - Hey, anytime. You're pretty okay too, for a girl. (laughing) (victorious music) (comical music)
