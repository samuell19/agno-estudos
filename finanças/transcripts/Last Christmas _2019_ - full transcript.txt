No, you can't do that. No, no, no, no, no. Everyone keeps everyone's secrets around here. It's like an unspoken rule. Well, you just told me Gideon's. Fair point. You're one of us now.

Must have been hard. Yeah. Dad was a lawyer. Um, and now he stays away from home as much as he can because he'd rather be dead. Except he's a minicab driver, which is sort of the same thing. Can he not practice here? No, he couldn't afford to retrain, so he's out all the time. Also to avoid my mother, who's given to depression in much the same way as, um... What? You're looking at me like some sort of science experiment that's gone wrong. Sorry. - No, I'm interested. - Huh. I mean, your mother... when was the last time you saw her not being depressed? Ooh, I think when I got really ill. And she was happy about that? No, but she was happy about the attention. I mean, I got a lot of attention, but I was unconscious. She got more. Just the doctors, the nurses, the hospital staff. Drama. God, she loved it. She sort of flowered under it like a... like a late blossoming or something. Anyway, when I got better, it all went away, and she's just never been the same since. Well, maybe she enjoyed being needed again. Oh, trust you to come up with something understanding. That is truly horrific. I mean, who buys this stuff? Santa. She's Chinese, so she's, you know, got access to some really freaky outlets. She just loves Christmas more than anything else. - More than taste or sanity. - Yes, exactly. And that isn't even the nastiest thing we sell. Inconceivable. Hang on. - ♪ Dun, dun, dun! ♪ - Oh! - Check it out. - What is it? - Is that donkey actually smiling at me? - Yeah. Yeah. And that baby has a full set of teeth. - Oof. - I sold four of these last week. I'm that good. Oh, it's a... oh, it's a techno manger. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool. It's a disco nativity scene. Is that really a good nutritional choice? Oh, God, don't you start. Where are you? Look up. Yeah. Yeah, after you... what you've been through, I mean, shouldn't you be eating quinoa or kale or something? Yeah, but this admittedly rank burger is all part of my grand plan to become a famous singer and die like Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and all the rest at the age of 27. - How old are you? - 45. Oh. Good to have dreams. Not really. I'm 26. Oh, thank God. You still have time. - Come on. Get rid of that. - Where...? Wait. Let's go. I've got a surprise for you. - Ugh, really? - Mm, yummy! There's something wrong with me, you know. I'm too trusting. Down a dark alley again with a complete stranger. I don't even... I mean, seriously, - where are you... - Pop yourself over here. - All right, then. - Need a hand? No. - Oh, Christ. - Oh. - Oh, my God. - Oh! That looked painful. - Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine! - Ah, you... you're fine. That was like poetry in motion. - Piss off. - Come on. Sure. Never wanted kids anyway. Okay. Now I am intrigued. - How are you gonna dispose of my body? - Shh... - Shh! - I... am shh-ing. Stay back. Are you seriously doing a James Bond impression? Now is not the time for unpleasantness.

So, this is our selection - of nutcrackers. - Working hard over here. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. You know, from the ballet? - Tchaikovsky? - Ah. Which kind of music is this? - I want something to be... - Listen. Be quiet. This is Christmas music. You must enjoy it. This is a big nutcracker. Can my nuts fit inside there? Uh, depends on how big are your nuts. But it's too big. We can't take that with us. Santa, um, I think I can take over from there. Because, um, there's also someone here, a gentleman, who requires your specific assistance. Yes, you can have a look. Think about it. I'm gonna show you to the even bigger nutcrackers around the corner. There's bigger nuts? - For your big nuts. Here we are. - Oh. Have you come back for the gibbon? Of all the things in my life, this is my best thing. What is? Christmas. Really? This is why I love to come in here. I also love it. That is why I have this shop.

I can smell the commitment. Do you know we have people turn up here, never been on an ice rink before? I just couldn't imagine. Do you know we had a woman turn up in a crop top? - In a crop top to audition. - Yeah, I remember. Do you remember her flip-flops? - Remember those? - Of course I remember. - I remember. Thank you. We'll be in touch. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think she'd be good for the horse. Don't you think? - No, we can... - Oh, no! - Are you all right? - I, uh... I did that just in case you thought I was too perfect. Okay. Okay. Thank goodness for a heavy woolen tight. Idiot. Skaters fall. It's fine. ...at the same time. Also, nobody's clapping. So, it went well, and I am happy. Good. All set for your date? Good Lord. Okay. - Right, um... - What? We're just gonna need to dial this down. I'm making an effort. He's gonna think he's wandered into the llama enclosure. Close. Ow. Mm-hmm. - Ow. - Oh, yeah. Serves you right. So I defer to the Swiper queen. - Blot. - Mm, mm. There we are. So, where is See-Through taking you? - I have no idea. - What's his name? I can't pronounce it. Lots of glottal stops. "Yogh..." Oh, when I try to say it, I sound like a cat with a fur ball. So I've decided to call him "Boy." Mm. Well, at least your name's easier to pronounce. What? Huang Qing Shin? You're not really called Santa? Of course not, idiot. - I chose it for the shop. - Really? Yeah, when I worked at the pet shop, I called myself Kitty. - No. - Mm-hmm. And at the health food shop, I was Miso. - No, no. - Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Guess what it was in the bakery on the Edgware Road. Uh, Crumpet? - Sausage Roll? - Muffin. - Muffin? - "Muff" for short. Excellent. More important is: how do I look? Really hot. Did you just giggle like a girl? I am a girl. - Not really. - Oh, shut up. And where's this man of yours? The one you keep looking out the window for instead of working. Oh, he's just... I don't know. He hasn't got a phone. - Oh. He's wise. - Mm. - What is he doing with you? - Nothing. Mm. Don't worry, elf. He'll turn up. We woke him up. Hi. Excuse me. I'm just looking for someone. - Who's that, then? - Uh, Tom. Ta-ta-ta. Would you like a biscuit, Arthur? Have you got a bourbon, Danny boy? No, but can I press you to a custard cream? Ooh. I wish somebody would. - Tom, did you say? - Yeah. Tom. Um, h-he's tall... Tom! Take your pick, young lady. Right. Yeah, see, the thing is, he's not homeless. Well, what's he doing here, then? Um, well, he works here. - Nights, I think. - Ah. Well, I don't see the night lot, me. - He must be a volunteer. - Yes. That's... Oi, Danny! Give us a hand? Speaking of which, be a pet and serve the teas while I get the soup sorted. And only two biscuits each, mind. I'm not made of bloody biscuits. And watch this one, 'cause last week, he filled his pockets. Come on, then! Tea's up! Okay. I'm Tom. - Ex-grenadier. Will I do? - Lovely. Um... Do you know, actually, it's... a whole different Tom. But would you like a biscuit? I could... make some tea. Just the two, then? Just... Anyone like a cup of tea? Try and keep it down to... Oi, oi. Nice of you to volunteer. Well, I-I didn't. I was press-ganged. You want to help us with the soup? No. Thank you, but no. If Tom Webster does come in, could you just tell him that Kate needs to talk to him? - Not "needs." - "Would like"? Yeah. Yeah. - Got it. - Yeah, 'cause he doesn't have a phone. Would you like a bowl of soup? You've earned it. No, I'm good. Thanks. Dan, what do you reckon? Bit up herself, I thought. - Yeah. - And-and she's very happy. - She was. - You show... I show you picture. - You showed me, Mum. - A little beautiful picture. - You showed me last time. - Easy, easy, easy. - And she's a... - Hey. - Ah! Oh, at last. - Hey. Uh, there she is. Ah. Hey, at last. I was so worry. Where you are, huh? - Huh? - Um, I was volunteering at a homeless shelter. - Uh, what it mean? - It means helping, Mum. - You? Helping? - Yes. - Ha, yeah. Sure you were. - Oh, really? And I just rescued an orphan from a burning car. Did I miss something? Oh, wow. Oh, jebote, Marta. I'm sorry. The dinner to celebrate your promotion. Second promotion. - Second. - Great achievement. Thank you, Dad. Now you are here, we have krem torta. I'm sorry. Seriously, Marta, I am sorry. It doesn't matter. - Oh, thanks a lot, Mum. - Your favorite. - I'm all right, actually. - What? So, is there something wrong with your favorite cake now? No. I'm just not hungry. Well, I'm... There's always something, isn't there? Like, you're hungry, you're not hungry. You're tired, you're overexcited. - You've got a tummy ache. - Give... Gosh, you're so tiresome, Katarina. Nabijem te na kurac, Marta. It's "Kate." Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You taught her this terrible word? - Of course not. - Do you actually even know what "nabijem te na kurac" means? Uh, yeah, I actually do. It means, "I will nail you to my dick." - Yeah, I knew that. - Not "dick." "Penis." Well, "dick" means "penis." - "Dick" means "penis"? - "Dick" means "penis." Yeah. - No, Dick is our neighbor. - It also means "penis." Dick, our-our neighbor, is called "penis"? Dick is penis. Penis is dick. That's the same word. - Would you stop saying "dick" and "penis"? - It's just... - I'm trying to explain. - Uh, uh, whatever, you know. - I'm just so bored of your shit. - Marta, stop. She's ill. - She's not ill anymore, Mum. - She is not ill anymore, Petra. And what you know? What you know anything about this family? You're never here. I'm not ill anymore, all right? No, she is still ill... why is she still working in silly Christmas shop when she was always the b-bright one? Nabijem te na kurac. You are very hard worker. Wha... Oh, right, yeah, well, well, apparently, with my pathetic, inferior little brain. Now she's wasting her life, which only a miracle save her. Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum. And you have job you dream of. Yeah, except that I didn't dream of it, did I? You did. You know, Dad can't be a lawyer here, so I had to be. No matter what I might have actually wanted to do. Yeah, would you rather drive minicab? Look what it done to him. He look thousand years old. Oh, thanks. - Nabijem I tebe na kurac. - And you... y-you sit there, and you think it's absolutely acceptable to say that she's cleverer than me. And I'm expected to swallow it just because she's been ill. - Marta, calm down. - No, don't you dare tell me to calm down, all right? - Marta. - All right, you don't care about anything, Katarina, or Kate, or whatever your name is now, because you're ashamed of who you are. Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am? What about you? Where's Alba? Shut up. On your big celebration dinner, where is your girlfriend? Alba? Alba is... Alba is Marta's flatmate. Yeah, and that's how it's always gonna be. I bet she's really happy about that. What she say? Oh, God, you're a piece of work. Marta. - Marta. - Marta. Eh. Eat. You look like skeleton. I got to go.

'Cause... because I've just been really stupid. I've been really, really stupid. I mean, it's a bit of a stretch, but... have you had a couple drinks? Oh, bugger off with your cleanly manliness. All right? Just... just go back to work. Leave me alone. No, I've just come back from helping the needy. Great. You know, just a bit of psych work. I work with the severely distressed. You know, when they get off on one. - Ah. - In fact, you're severely distressed and have just gone off on one, so I'm glad that we bumped into each other. Shall we go get my phone from that cupboard? Okay. Let's go. Where are you taking me? Home. - It's down here. - Yeah. Come on in. Uh, wow. You weren't kidding. Place is so tidy. - Come take a seat. - No. Uh, no. I can't.

Maybe this is more you than anything. I'm a mess. Kind of. In here. When I was ill, it was a heart thing. Right. I had a heart transplant. I don't tell people, 'cause they get weird, but I don't think you'll get weird. No. Is this okay? They took out my heart. They took it and threw it away. And I... and I don't know what they put back, but it felt weird and different and strange and... and like I'd lost my most special part. And they kept telling me I was lucky to be alive. But I didn't feel alive. I just felt half dead. Come here. I was supposed to be special. I didn't ask to be, but... they made me feel special when I was ill. And then I was special when I nearly died and had a transplant, but... then they just expected me to be normal and get on with life. There's no such thing as normal. It's a stupid word. Does a lot of damage. Nothing feels right. You're the only person that makes me feel, like, I don't know... ...solid. Like I exist. I'm a part-time cycle courier who doesn't even have a phone. I know. It's pretty sad. And I could sing before. Turns out... I can't do anything. I think the whole special... being-special thing is overrated. I think just to be a human being is hard. You know, really hard. You seem to manage all right. One thing someone said to me helped me. "Every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character." It just means that you're built of everything you do. And that's okay. Who am I? I don't know. What's all this "me" business anyway? Hmm?

Oh, my God. Jump in there. - Oh, the bed. - In the bed there. Bed. What...? Tom, I said... "we." This is close enough for now. - We hardly know each other. - Wha...? What do you mean?

No, it's never gonna happen. Why? Well, we... He just won't commit because he thinks I depend on him too much, and he basically said that I had made a career out of being a victim. Hmm.

Uh, I don't think so, unless he's with you. - No, no. I just came to find him. - Oh. - He'll probably turn up. - Right. So, shall we get started, then? Ooh, started on what? Just taking a little look, huh? Right, well, I've looked, and there it is. Small but compact. It's neat. And that's one of its selling points. - It's for sale? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Freehold this one, not for rental. Yeah. That's why he keeps it so tidy. Oh, yeah. There's no room for clutter here. But there is plenty of storage space. Et voilà. Huh. What have we got here? Oh, my God. Literally in the cupboard. No wonder it died. - I'll give it to him. Don't worry. - Give it to who? - Tom. - Who's that, then? Tom, who lives here but is selling the flat. No. No one lives here. It's-it's been empty for months. Maybe he was squatting. What? Was there a squatter here? - Oh, bloody hell. - Um... Excuse my language. It's typical, that is. It's all that probate stuff that stops us - from getting on with our jobs. That's the prob... - "Probate"? Yeah, you know, when someone dies. It's a pain in the fundament. Who's died? Oh, previous owner. Who...? Uh, someone Webster, I think. Uh, youngish bloke. Sad, really. It was last Christmas, by all accounts. Madam. Hello. Madam? Are you all right? Yeah.
