And speaking of which, can you upgrade me to first class for my trip to Bali? -[assistant] Okay. -[sighs] Wow. See, looks like everyone's already gone on vacation. I can't wait to leave for mine on Christmas Eve. [assistant] Copy that, Nicole. Oh, have my swimsuits arrived yet from Saks? [assistant] Sure did. Two teeny, tiny bikinis. Yes, honey, eight months ofPilates or your girl can't wait to slay this beautiful bronze body all over Bali's white sands and slay it for the gram. [assistant] Well, before you slay, what should I do about ordering Christmas presents for your family? Uh, like the last three years, just sign my name, send holiday cards for my sisters Diedre and Tammy. [assistant] Done and done. And what about gifts for your parents? Pick ten options for me to review. I wanna get something nice for my mom and dad. [assistant] Will do, by the way, Mark came by looking for you earlier. He said it's important. Of course, the bank's managing partner is looking for me. It's bonus day. It's time for the queen to collect her coins. [instrumental music] [exhales] All right, you ready? -Get lower. -Oh, my God. -Like that? Oh, my God. -[Spyder] Lower. [Spyder] Okay. [chuckles] -All right, you good? -Yes. All right, let's go down. -[Spyder grunts] -[Tammy sighs] [Tammy] Oh, okay. -[Spyder grunts] -Okay? -Okay. One last deep breath. -Okay. And release. Release. Go forth in peace and in love. -Yes. Hm. -Namaste. Oh, that feels so good. I needed that. -Good stretch, Tammy. -Namaste,boo. [exhales] And now I'm starving. What's for breakfast? Yes, sir! I thought you'd never ask. -Good and good for you. -Mm. Here you go. -Um... -[Spyder sighs] Spyder, what is this? It smells like chitlins and broccoli strained through a sweaty gym sock. [laughs] This is an ancient Eastern detoxifier I got from this vegan juice spot in East Atlanta. So drink up. Pinch your nose back. It's, it's good for you. Okay, I'm just throwing up in my mouth a lot right now. You gotta keep this body right and tight if you wanna open up Rashad's lounge tour, right? [knocking on door] -I'll be back. -Okay. -Drink that up. -Okay. Sorry, Jeremiah. Ooh. Better you than me, babe. What? Evicted? W... I thought you said you paid the back rent. Yeah... So, so that money you got for singing at Estelle's, I had to kinda hand it over to Malik in order to go to the studio and produce some more beats. He wouldn't let me come in unless I took care of that $2500 balance. I just wasn't thinkin'. Where are we gonna go, Spyder? It's the week before Christmas. And we're gonna be out on the street! Namaste,my ass. I want some real food. That's fair. ♪ When it's cold I've been told ♪ ♪ You just need a hand to hold ♪ ♪ So take mine... Uh, Diedre? Diedre! Come help me and your mom make this call to your sister. [sighs] No, dad, I'm busy. Little girl, don't make me take my belt off. [Diedre laughs] Excuse me, daddy, but I am 32 years old. Besides, you know you were never the disciplinarian. It was always mama whipping out the switch like a ninja on me, Tammy and Nicole every time we got in trouble when we were little. She's right, Gerald. You could never punish the girls. I was always the bad cop. -Mm-hmm. -All right, Diedre. Now come on over here and help me make this call before your mama breaks out her switch. -[guitar music] -[cell phone ringing] -Hi, daddy. -Hey, baby girl. -Can I call you back? -[Gerald] Hold on. Your sister Diedre's patchin' in your sister Nicole. -[sighs] Oh, dad. -Oh, go on. [Santa] Merry Christmas! Really? Santa, here you go. Merry Christmas. [cell phone vibrating] -[sighs] Hey, daddy. -Hey, Nikki. I'm sorry, c-can I call you back? 'Cause I'm-I'm kinda in the middle of something. [Gerald] Nikki, hold on, let me tap in your sister Tammy. W-wait, no, no, no, dad, I can't... Hi, girls! Merry Christmas! [Tammy and Nicole] Merry Christmas, daddy. -Is mom okay? -I'm here, babies! -I-I miss you! -[Gerald] We're both fine. Don't you worry. Your sister Diedre's here, too. [Nicole] Dad, look, I-I'm sorry. I love you. I'm just, I'm in the middle of something. I have to go. I'll call you later. Daddy, I was actually gonna call you... Listen, girls, we won the lottery! -What? -What? You won the lottery? We won $10 million in the Lonestar Christmas Lottery! Yeah, and I want you both to come home to Houston for the holidays so we can claim the prize together as a family. Now, look, you're both overdue for a trip home. It's been three years. Look, your mother wants to see you both before she... Uh, look, look, just come home. Come home, girls. It is time. [instrumental music] [sighs] Look, honey, doesn't our Christmas card photo look great here? [mumbling] Mi amor. I said, doesn't our Christmas card look great? Oh, yes. I'm just trying to finish this paperwork for Karen. I'm gonna have to drop it off to her tomorrow because Christmas is a week away. We need to get all of this in before everyone breaks for the holiday. Okay, look, I know that we want to turn this paperwork in, but it's stressing you out, and it's not about the paperwork. It's because your dad asked your sisters to come home for Christmas. Yeah, you know Nicole and Tammy haven't been home in over three years to help with mom, claiming that they're so busy. But the minute dad wins the lottery, they're on their way to Houston looking for a payday. Look, honey, you and your sisters didn't always get along growing up, because as the oldest, you had to stay at home while your parents worked the restaurant. It just seems like you still resent Nicole and Tammy because they got to be kids and you had to grow up. No, it's because they're selfish. They have no clue how hard things have gotten for us here. We help dad every day at that restaurant and help take care of mom on the weekends when he needs a break. I know, it can be hard with your mom sometimes. Her dementia comes and goes. But today she had a good day. Her memory was sharp. And she was telling her, uh, old stories again, talking about her music school. Yeah, I guess that is one good thing about the lottery money. Dad can finally get mom that music school that she's always wanted. Oh, I'm so happy for them. It's just sad because with mom's dementia advancing the way it is, she may not even be able to run the school that she's always dreamed about, or even teach the students. You know what story she told me about today? The one about how the bully stole Tammy's bike and you fought him and his brother to get your little sister's bike back. Yeah, I remember that. She got Tammy that bike for her seventh birthday. You know, those boys learned the hard way that day that nobody comes for the Davenport sisters, okay? [laughing] And now that I'm finished with all this paperwork, I can finish wrappin' these presents so we can drop 'em off to mom and dad's. Well, aren't you Santa's little helper? You know how much I love, love, love Christmas. Decorating the tree, singing the carols, eating all those delicious desserts you be making. -[mumbles] -Wrapping these gifts. I can't wait for mom to see the gift I got her. She's gonna love it. You know what would be the best gift for your mom? For you to make up with your sisters. I'd give anything to have my family back in my life, Diedre. You're lucky that you still can. Look, babe, I'm sorry that your family doesn't accept our marriage. But, look, we are your family now. -Okay? -[sighs] We not going nowhere. You good here. [instrumental "Joy To The World"] -Oh. Damn it! -[object clatters] I can't even seem to do the simple things anymore. Oh, honey, it's fine. Don't worry about it. It seems like I'm breaking more ornaments than I'm hanging on the tree this year. We have plenty of ornaments. The tree looks beautiful. And best of all, the girls are coming home and they're gonna love it. Oh, I hope so, Gerald. And when we get that lottery prize, we're going to open up your music school, my love. Oh. [Gerald] Yeah. Well, well. Look what the lottery drug in. Well, hello, sis. Nice to see you, too, Diedre. Sorry, Nik. You know, it's just been so long. Nicole, it's nice to finally meet you in person. Merry Christmas, Belinda. Merry Christmas and welcome home. I heard you're killing it in New York. And I have heard such great things about you from my parents. Right, because she couldn't be bothered to come to our wedding three years ago. Look, I really hate that I wasn't able to make it to your wedding, I mean, but I was in the middle of closing a really big deal at work-- Don't worry about it, we had a quick little ceremony at the courthouse a week after your sister proposed. Yeah, I had to make sure I got her down there before she changed her mind on me. A lot of people couldn't make it on such short notice, so we had a cute little reception, you know, just your parents and friends at the restaurant. Yeah, I mean, look, a week's notice. I mean, well, it is a bit challenging to try to navigate. You missed our wedding, but then the minute dad calls to tell you that he wins $10 million in the lottery, you come running home. Damn, Diedre, like, do you have to come at me as soon as I walk through the door? ♪ Merry Christmas my sisters Uh, excuse me. Merry Christmas. Damn, how long are y'all staying? -You got it, babe? -[grunts] I got it. [sighs] Yes, sir. -Merry Christmas, y'all! -Come on in. Yes, ma'am. Merry, Merry Christmas, Tammy. [softly] Hi, sis. Merry Christmas, Titi. [Tammy] Merry Christmas. So nice to finally meet you, Tammy. Oh! Merry Christmas, my sister. Merry Christmas. Ooh, that's the oven. -I've gotta go check that. -[car honking] -[sighs] -Uh... who is that? Oh, that's the cab driver. Fact, he need to get paid. Somebody got $60? I got to... -Do you... -Appreciate that. BRB, PBM. Thanks, sis, Spyder just booked a lounge tour for me and we're putting all the money towards my new demo. We're just a little short this month. -Hm. -This month? You forget I help daddy with his banking app on his phone every time you ask him to send you and, uh, Roach some money. You know my man's name is Spyder. -My bad, sis. -Hell, no. Hold on, hold up. You mean to tell me that daddy is giving you and hashtag Yoga Bae money, too? Uh, well, you mean, hashtag Bum Bae. [scoffs] See, I thought I was the only one that was getting the calls, the texts, the carrier pigeon messages, the faxes, the DMs asking for money for... What was it? Oh, I remember. Studio sessions, head shots. Website developers, promotional fliers... Girl, whatever, don't act like you can't spare the money for your little sister, Nicole. I told you, it was just a loan. We're gonna pay you back. [Nicole and Diedre scoffing] -[Nicole and Diedre] When? -After the tour and the demo. Yeah. Hey, hey, my baby is about to blow up. All right? This lounge tour is about to be litty for real. Not to mention, T done got all these new social-media followers who needs new clips for the music that's about to come out. -Come on now. -[Nicole] Okay. Last time I checked, social media and likes don't pay bills, litty or not. Right, I guess that's, uh, why you guys are here with all your worldly possessions. Evicted again, Spyder? I know you ain't got my little sister Erykah Ba-don't singing on street corners for incense and spare change. Huh. Very funny, Diedre. We were actually thinking about moving anyway. Oh, whatever, just make sure you don't come asking me and my wife for any money. Actually, you know, speaking of wives, are you and Spyder married now, too? Did I miss that wedding invitation, Tammy? Uh, actually, no. Me and Tammy, we don't prescribe to the Western culture's oppressive, patriarchal notions of tethering people together. See, Tammy and I are in a committed bond. -That's right. -One connected at the heart. -Mm-hm. -And the spirit. -Yeah. -And in the after-life. [Nicole] Oh, Lord. Now you see, that kind of bond is a bond that no man's institution can break apart. Ain't that right, my queen? -That's right, my king. -Mm-hmm. Our committed bond is more lasting and sacred than anything the government could construct. Okay, in other words, sis, this broke fool can't afford an engagement ring. Exactly. [indistinct chatter] -Oh. -Oh, mama! -[laughter] -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Nicole Elizabeth. Oh, I've missed you, my love. It's been too long. -Mommy! Merry Christmas! -Come here. -Oh. -[Tammy] You look so good. Well, of course I do, Tabitha Grace. You know my black don't crack, it just gets fine like wine. -What were you expecting, hm? -Hey, Ms. Diane. Hey, you remember me, from the video chats? I'm her boyfriend Spyder. The doctors say I have dementia, Spyder. -I'm not deaf. -Okay, cool. That's good to hear. Give me some love, girl. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I missed you. -What's up, boss? -[chuckles] Oh? Oh. [Spyder] That's what I'm talkin' about. Well, look, why don't you girls take your things upstairs and come down for dinner in about an hour? Diedre, Belinda and your mom have been cooking all day long. -Sounds like a plan. -[Gerald] Yeah. -I'm starving. -[Gerald] Okay. [Diedre] Come on, mama, I'll help you set the table. Oh, thank you, baby. [Spyder] That's right. -You got it? -Yeah, I got it. -Ooh. Yup. -Be careful with that one. I'mma be careful, babe. You know me. Oh, oh, shoot. [Diane] Ah! Will you look at that? [Nicole] Is that what I think that is, daddy? Yes, indeed, baby girl. It's my double-smoked pineapple honey-glazed ham. -Yes! -Ooh. [Nicole] Hey, and it's not even Christmas dinner yet. I bet you can't get food like this in New York. [Gerald] It is so nice to have everybody home. -I had to break out my smoker. -Mm-hmm. Yeah, this is, uh, quite the spread y'all cooked up. But y'all have some like, uh, vegetables, whole grains, tofu, anything like that? -Tofu, at Christmas time? -Mm. -Are you sure you're black? -We're vegan, Diedre. -We can't eat any of this. -Vegan? There's some carrots right there. What's that? -Diane, you hear this? -Hm? Our kids done joined a cult. -A cult? Where's my holy water? -[all chuckling] Daddy, that basically means that they can't eat anything with parents or flavor. We know, sweetheart. We know. Uh, to be honest, I mean, y'all shouldn't really be eating this stuff either. [Nicole chuckles] Well, watch me. Shoo, daddy's ham will have you Crip walkin' at Christmas, right? So you can pass on all this ham, tomatoes, mac and cheese, fried chicken grains if you want to. -Just that's more for me. -And me, too. Let me, um, pass you this fried chicken, sis. [Nicole] Thank you, sis, I appreciate that. You don't want none of this, Tammy? N-no... No, I-I'm good. My body is a temple. Now, I felt like this was gonna happen, so I packed us a little something something. -Oh, babe, you did? -Yes, sir. I'm starving. Yes, sir. I can't be starving for too much longer. -[mumbles] -[Diedre laughs] Mm-hmm. Yes, sir. There's mine, right here. -Babe? -Hm? What's this? Oh, that's quinoa, chickpea, squash, Brussells sprout casserole. Oh, quin... what? Boy, better come over here and get some of this ham. -[Nicole] Okay. No harm. -[laughter] -[Tammy] Babe? -What's up? This is all you brought for us? Oh, I'm trippin'. Hold on. Oh. [laughs] Bon appetite,Tammy. It is so good to have all of my girls home. -It is truly a blessing. -Yes, it is, Gerald. But don't you girls go thinking you're grown and you gonna run the streets all hours of the night while you're home for your Christmas break from school. I got my eye on all of you, especially you, Nicole, with your fast behind. I caught you trying to sneak that boy in your bedroom window last week. [Diedre] Um, mom, don't worry. We're all gonna be home in time for curfew. -Even fast-tail Nicole. -[Spyder] Yes, sir. Speaking of blessings, I've got a $10 million blessing. My number finally hit! [Spyder] But since we on the topic, how do you plan on splitting this here, uh, family earnings? Because me and Tammy want to open a recording studio for... [Spyder groans] [Nicole] When do you have to claim the prize, daddy? Actually, have you talked to a lawyer? You know, you should have representation. Have you told anyone outside of the family about this? Because once the news breaks that you won $10 million, you're gonna have all sorts of people and scammers lining up outside that door with their hands out. People with their hand out. You mean, like you? [Gerald] Don't worry, Nikki. I have to claim the prize by Thursday, Christmas Day. But, daddy, today's Saturday. Why didn't you turn the ticket in when you first won? That's what I told daddy to do. I wanted to wait for all of my girls to be home so we could claim the prize together. This is a big moment. Dad's, that's nice and all, but-- Diedre, your sisters haven't been home for Christmas in years, Tammy always has Christmas gigs and Nikki always has her big deals around Christmas. Time is precious and you all need to fix these issues between you, so all the arguing and the fighting has to stop or none of you will get a cut of the lottery prize. And I mean it. Well, daddy, can we see the lottery ticket? I'll get it after dinner, T. But right now I think I hear a surprise. Mom, I think some of your students are outside. What?

[piano music] [Tammy] ...I'm gonna do with the money. That's a good question. Hey, speaking of that... Shouldn't we be helping your dad find that lottery ticket? I mean... Listen to you. You got your hand out already. Diedre, please. It's Christmas. -I mean, I'm just saying. -Don't worry, Belinda. We're used to being judged by Diedre. It's her favorite thing to do. Actually, I didn't get to do any of my favorite things because I'm busy taking care of my responsibilities, like, working at the restaurant and helping mom and dad. And we appreciate that, Diedre. [Diedre] You know, both of you could have came home more often to see mom. [Nicole] Diedre, we didn't know that mom was so... [Tammy] Dad, what's wrong? The lottery ticket, it's gone. -[all] What? -The lottery ticket is gone! [Diedre] What do you mean it's gone? [Nicole] It can't be. You must have overlooked it. Uh, maybe I'll look again. Look, dad, are you sure that you put the ticket in the safe in your study? Well, of course, Nikki. That'd be the safest place to keep it. Only your mom and I know the combination. [humming "Gloria In Excelsis Deo"] [Gerald sighs] Sweet pea? Sweet peach? Diane? -Hm? Oh, hello, husband. -[Gerald] Hi. Do you remember when we put the Lonestar Christmas lottery ticket in the safe? Well, of course, Gerald. -We won $10 million. -Yes. Does that mean I can open my music school now? Yes, sweetheart, yes. But, um, I just need to find the ticket. I put it in the safe, but now it's gone. I know. You know? -Well, how do you know? -Because I hid it. You hid it? But, angel, we-we said we'd keep it in the safe. Mama D, do you remember where you put the ticket? Shh... I'm not telling. We don't want anybody to steal our money. But, mom, we need you to tell dad where you put the ticket so we can claim the lottery prize. W-what are you talking about? He, he put it in the safe. Mama, daddy's trying to tell you the ticket isn't in the safe. Yeah, Mama D, where the ticket at? What? I-I thought we all wanted to know where the ticket was. What did I do? I'm so sorry, Gerald. W-what did I do? Mama, mama, you didn't do anything wrong, okay? It's okay. You did nothing wrong. -It's all right, honey. -Let's get some rest, okay? -Yeah. -I-I'll take her upstairs. -Come on, honey. -I'll make her some tea. -Come on. I understand. -But... [Gerald] It's all right. All right, so now what? How are we supposed to find this lottery ticket? We? Don't act like you're a part of this family. Remember, you don't believe in marriage. Diedre, fall back. Spyder is just trying to help. Yeah. Help himself to my mom and dad's money. Okay, look, stop, I'll put a plan together, assign some tasks and we'll find this ticket before Christmas Day. The only reason why both of you are home right now is because both of you want some of mom and dad's money too. Okay, hold on. We came home because daddy asked us to. It's not about the money, you can't sit up here and act like we don't love mom and dad just as much as you do. You know I'm always busy at work. So don't sit up here and treat me like I'm flighty and irresponsible like Tammy. Okay, I'm not flighty. I'm an artist. Dad asked us to come home, and I came even though Christmas is the busiest time of year for me with holiday parties and club gigs. Okay, we get it, you're an artist and you're sensitive about your ish. Sorry, not sorry. And what about you, Ms. Nikki? What were your plans this Christmas if dad wouldn't have called and said that he won the lottery? Hm. Bali, okay? I was gonna go to Bali. -[Diedre] Yeah. Exactly. -Shocker. And you, dad works his tail off to keep this restaurant afloat while sending you, a grown woman, a monthly allowance. The only gig that your little boyfriend manager is gonna get you is singing at the homeless shelter that you're about to be livin' in. I mean, at least a homeless shelter has a captive audience. [Tammy] You need to mind your business, Diedre. I'm pursuing a career in music, going after my dreams. Yeah, that must be nice because I didn't get to follow my dreams, Tammy. I had to stay here and help mom and dad. Oh, my God. Okay, blah, blah, Diedre, we know. The dutiful daughter who always does everything right. -[Diedre] You know what-- -But we're here now. Exactly, Diedre. We are here now. [Tammy] Plus, we didn't know mom was deteriorating so quickly. I mean, we video chat every week. Why didn't anybody say anything? Because mom made dad promise to only video chat on the good days. She didn't wanna tell you guys until after Christmas. There's times that she spoke to you earlier that day and then didn't even remember later that night that she had just spoke to you. Why wouldn't you tell us this, Diedre? I shouldn't have to, Nicole. -[cell phone ringing] -Oh. I need to take this. Work calls. So, you know, put that before your family, right? Typical. Typical. Hey, Dan, what's up? So did you blow through your severance package already from the bank yet? Very funny, Davenport, I'm calling because I'm heading into a meeting with some of our former colleagues. We're starting our own hedge fund. Really? Who's joining the team? We're keeping the group small, it's me, Thomas, Ray, Kim and you, if you're in. Baxter will head up London. We've identified the institutional investor targets and we think we can close them quickly. Ah, I see, institutional investors. My specialty. So basically, you need my rolodex. Your rolodex and your financial buy-in if you're joining the team. Well, what's the buy-in for partners? [Dan] One million, 50 percent in 48 hours, the balance due in 30 days. I'm not that liquid right now. We have to move fast to close these investors. I need your answer ASAP. Look, do you want to spend the next six months... -Looking for a new job? -Of course not. Then can you come up with the money or not, Davenport? [exhales] I may have a way. [Dan] I need your answer in 48 hours. I'll email the term sheet. This train is moving fast, Davenport. Get onboard or get left at the station. -[door opens] -Hey. Yo, baby. We gotta find that lottery ticket. I know. My dad needs that money to take care of mom. He can't be working in that restaurant all day and all night anymore. Yeah, yeah. We need the lottery ticket, too, baby. Look, if we got it, we can make a studio. Look, if we did that, we wouldn't have to grovel at these labels anymore, baby. With your voice, my dope beats and that lottery ticket, come on, you'd be a star. I don't know if I'll get much of the money, Spyder. I mean, in addition to using this lottery money to take care of mom's medical needs, my dad's gonna wanna open mom's music school. And really, there's nothing to talk about until we actually find the ticket. Okay, well, then let's just go ahead and find the ticket. Talk to your mom again. Spyder, you've seen my mom's condition. She doesn't even remember where she put it. -I just... -Okay. -One second. -[sighs] [sighs] No more nuts and cranberries, Spyder, please. Girl, this ain't no nuts and cranberries. I bought these special gummies because I knew the trip would be stressful. -Oh. Nice. -You want some, don't you? Yes, sir. Take that. Wait. How did you get these on the plane? You didn't smuggle these up your... What? No. No, TSA Tammy. Come on, now I didn't smuggle these... Your boy got connections, all right? I picked these up from the homey's house when your dad sent me on that run to go find some extra bulbs for the outside Christmas lights. -Oh. Hm. -Take one. [sighs] [laughs] Stop playin'. You can't leave these around the house, you know? -My parents would kill me. -Oh, my God! Tammy, will you relax? Jeez. Come here. Come here. There we go. Yes, sir. Relax. Jeez. [sighs] Here we are... in your high-school bedroom. -Mm. -Mm-hmm. Now, what secrets would these walls tell about teenage Tammy if they could talk? -I was an angel, thank you. -Mm-hmm. So you weren't up here sneaking no boys or nothing like that? No way. You heard mama. That was fast-tail Nicole. Oh, sorry. -Well then, I got an idea. -Hm? [Spyder grunts] I think it's time for us to christen this bedroom, what you think? -You think? Yeah? Yeah! -Yeah. Okay, come on... [instrumental "Jingle Bells"] Yes? Thanks for calling the Magnolia Corner Cafe. We'll have your order ready in 30 minutes. Wow! Magnolia Cafe looks good, pops. I love those new chairs! No thanks to you, of course. Really, Diedre, because if I remember correctly, I was the one that paid for the brand-new air-conditioner when it broke last summer. There you go. Throwing around your checkbook. What are you doing here anyway? I told mom that I would help paint her nails today. Oh. Look at you, so much help. Listen, girls, please, let's have a peaceful family Christmas. I'm sorry, I'm just gonna review some documents. When I'm done, I'll paint mom's nails. Okay. -Sister. -Oh, no, no, no, no. I shouldn't. That holiday weight will creep up on a sister. My triple-layer cake is calorie-free. Scout's honor. Okay, well, in that case, maybe just one. Oh, my goodness! What is this heavenly creation? [chuckles] It's a family recipe passed down from mi abuela. God rest her soul. No wonder my sister married you. Yeah, I'm just happy that your dad let me add some of my family recipes to Magnolia's menu. I see why. This is delicious! Is your family gonna be joining us for Christmas dinner? I actually haven't seen my family in years, since I told them that I was marrying your sister. Oh, no. Belinda, I'm so sorry. -Uh, I didn't know. -It's okay. I just keep hoping that one day they'll accept me and my wife and... Enough about that. It's good to have you home, Nicole. Oh. But let me show you something. I love this picture of them. The day they opened this place. Look at them, married, opening a business. Sometimes both of those things seem so far away. You're only as far away from something as you wanna be. I should have done more. I've just been so busy with work and-- Nicole, you're here now. That's all that matters. It's never too late for family. Excuse me. Looks like someone is still that greedy girl from high school who could never save me a bite. Tyson... Oh, my God. Hi! Um... [Tyson] Mm. [Nicole] How are you? How are you, Ms. Big-Time Banker? I haven't seen you in years. Wow. I, I haven't seen you since... Four years ago. The Christmas block party. And I believe it was at the mistletoe kissing booth. Ah, yes. The mistletoe kissing booth. Mom's favorite time of year at the block party. I can't believe I used to sing with my sisters every single year. Since you're home, are you all performing this year? [snorts] Seriously? Not even if Jesus was the opening act. I'm sure your mom would love to see you all sing together again without the second coming. It wouldn't be the same... now that mom can't play the piano anymore. I think you'd be surprised to see what your mom could do. And how would you know? I see your mom about every week or so. Really? Why so often? That cake you were inhaling when I first walked in is one reason. Belinda's triple-layer cakes is one of my favorites. See, and that's why it's a good thing I live in New York because I would be 300 pounds eating Belinda's desserts. [sighs] So are you still killing it in the Big Apple? Yeah. Yeah. No, I-I love New York. New York is great. But is it all work and no play? Who said there's no time for play? [chuckles] I don't see a ring on your finger, so it means you probably don't have much time for a man in your life. Maybe I just haven't found the right guy yet. You know? But enough about me. What about you? You are suited and you got your tie on. I never took you for a suit-and-tie kind of guy. I'm the head basketball coach at Texas Canyons University. We won two conference championship two years in a row. Impressive record, coach. Okay. And what's up with the briefcase? This is the secret to my two state championships. I hope four slices of my cake is enough this time. It's perfect. Thank you, Belinda. -[laughs] -Wait a second. So you put cake in your briefcase, coach? [sighs] Have you ever been around college athletes? When it comes to food, they are like human vacuums. So I put my food in my briefcase because I know they won't go looking for that on the bus. -[laughs] -[Cherry] Tyson! There you are! You know, I've been calling you, honey. Hey. Cherry! I'm sorry. I-I didn't hear my phone. Ah, no worries, silly. I'm just glad I finally found you. And, of course, you're at Magnolia's Corner Cafe on game day? Ugh! Anyhoo, Tyson, I've got good news. Oh, really? What's the good news? [yells] Ta-da! Oh, your Christmas sweater came in the mail today! It's perfect! I love it. [chuckles] It certainly screams Christmas. Ooh, mm. I got one more surprise for you, boo bear. -Oh, wow, another surprise. -[Cherry] Mm-hmm. Surprise! I also got one for Sprinkles. Me, you and Sprinkles can all wear it tomorrow for our Christmas card photoshoot. [Cherry] Don't you just love it? Don't you love it, boo bear? Oh. I'm rude. I'm Cherry Richards, Tyson's girlfriend. [chuckles] Okay. Nicole Davenport. I-I think you, Tyson and Sprinkles in the same sweater... It's an amazing card, Tyson. I know! Isn't it just to die for? I'm sure someone wants to die. I just hate the fact that we only have tomorrow to do it, but we've been traveling so much with the team that tomorrow is our first available opening. Thankfully, I was planning on emailing the cards. We've? We've been traveling with the team? Yes, I'm the head cheerleading coach, so my girls and I cheer on our boys at every game. Go, Texas Canyons! Go, Texas Canyons! Oh, wow! Yay! Texas Canyons! Tyson! Cherry, we should probably get going, I gotta meet the boys back at the bus for the game. Okay, but before you go, we have to find a holiday prop for the photoshoot. A-a prop? The sweaters, uh, aren't enough? No, look, we need something that's gonna make the photo really pop, like giant candy canes or reindeer, Santa hats... Ooh, I have an idea. What about mistletoe? You can hang mistletoe over your heads, Tyson. I love, love, love that idea! You can hold the mistletoe and Sprinkles and I will give you a little kiss! Don't you just love that, sweetie? Yeah, don't you just love that, Tyson? Oh. Thank you, Nancy. What a great idea. Nicole. Wait. My name is Nicole. [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] Shouldn't we be at home trying to find this lottery ticket? I didn't even get to finish looking through all the closets before dad said mom wanted us to come to this stupid block party. Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Spyder is ransacking the house right now as we speak. Okay, will you stop sweating Spyder-- -I mean, I'm just saying that-- -Stop! Mom wanted us all to come to the Christmas block party. So can we please pretend to be a happy family for once for her? We'll find the ticket in the morning. [cell phone vibrates] Babe, Nicole is right. Let's just do this for mom. I mean, we can find the ticket in the morning. Nicole, isn't that Tyson over there? Oh, Ty... Oh, it's Tyson. Don't act like you don't see him. Don't be trying to hide from your ex. -He's already seen you. -Merry Christmas, Davenports. Merry Christmas, Tyson. How was your game? Oh, my boys whooped Fullerton College. So you going after that third ring this year, huh, coach? As long as your wife keep making them cakes, we good. -I know that's right. Hey. -[laughter] -Merry Christmas, Tyson. -Ah. How's your singing career coming along, Tammy? I can't wait to hear a hit song from you on the radio. Oh, we're working on it. It's coming. Just wait on. Mm-hmm, just remember the people who knew you when you was a little girl singing into that hairbrush pretending to be Beyonce in front of stuffed animals when you become a star. Okay, believe me, when I become a star, I'm forgetting all of y'all. -Oh, really? -Oh, okay. Except you, mommy. Look at that. Peanuts? No, thank you. So, about earlier. I was gonna tell you about Cherry before she showed up. Tyson, I'm not trippin'. It's all good. We're good. -Um... -Where's Cherry and her dog? She dropped off Sprinkles at a last-minute grooming appointment at the doggie spa. Apparently, he wasn't camera ready. Sounds about right. Wow, look at this. The mistletoe booth. What do we have here? [Cherry] Tyson! Tyson, over here! -Oh. Hey, hey. Hey. -Oh. Cherry, I-I thought you said you took Sprinkles to the groomer. Yeah, I did, I dropped him off for color and a cut and then I went to pick up more presents. Dang, it's too bad Sprinkles isn't here because you guys could totally take your Christmas photo at the mistletoe booth. Oh! That is a great idea, Nancy! We could take the card right now. Right now? Um... Uh... What about Sprinkles? And-and I don't have my Christmas sweater. Oh, Tyson! Duh! I still have the sweater with me. Duh, Tyson! Ask and ye shall receive. -So perfect. Thanks. -Yeah.

I saw y'all at the restaurant talking and he definitely couldn't keep his eyes off you at the block party. Ain't nothing going on between me and Tyson. That man got a girlfriend. Who? That girl? Um, uh, what's her name? Pineapple, Kumquat, Tomato, whatever it is? You are not right. You know that woman's name is Cherry. Oh, well, she definitely don't seem like his type to me. I'm just sayin'. Not everyone is as fortunate to meet someone as awesome as Belinda. They could if they tried and didn't just work all the time. Wow, you couldn't give me five minutes, five minutes, Diedre, without judging my life. I'm just stating an observation because you always put work ahead of your family. Why do you think that you get to police how people show up for family? When people stopped showing up for family! Both of you left me here, alone, and just assumed that I would just continue to be the caretaker forever. That is ridiculous! Why are you never there for me? You missed my wedding. Of all days, Nicole, my wedding? -You know why. -Do-do me a favor. And explain to me why. Because I'm working! Ow! What the... Stop fighting! God, I'm sick of it! You know why I don't come home anymore? This is why. I can't stand all the fighting. And if I try to say anything about it, it's, you just dismiss me like I'm just a little kid! Girl, stop being so dramatic. You want to know why neither one of us came to your wedding? -Why? -Because you... Obviously didn't want us there. We had to find out from daddy that you were getting engaged and then, surprise, married a week later. And not to mention, it was a week before Christmas. You didn't give us enough time to get there. And, yeah, I didn't have money for a flight, but I would have driven across the country to watch my sister marry her best friend. You stop acting like the victim all the time. You are just as much to blame for us not being there as we are. And what about you, Nikki? What, your, your private jet was in the shop? -Are you serious? -You don't get it. -Are you serious? -I'm just saying... -No, no, don't get it. -Stop... Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I can hear y'all all the way upstairs. -Sorry, dad. -We're sorry, dad. We didn't mean to wake you. Is mom okay? Well, thankfully, she's still a sound sleeper. I cannot believe that you all are down here caught up within yourselves. Don't you know how hard things are for your mother right now? It breaks my heart to see you all still fighting like when you was children. -Sorry, daddy. -I'm sorry. Well, you all know what happens when you fight. It is time to settle things like when you were little girls. Oh, no, no, no, daddy. Please, no. Oh, dad, we won't fight anymore, we swear. No, dad, we're grown women. -We're not little kids anymore. -Right. You act like little kids, you're gonna get treated like little kids. Now suit up. Man, we look ridiculous! I can't believe daddy bought these brand-new sumo suits after all these years. I've been waiting to whoop y'all since we was kids. -Let's go! -Bring it. Ooh, it's about to go down. [all screaming] -[laughter] -[clamoring] Get off me! Got you! -Got you! Got! Give me! -[Spyder] Hey, baby! Baby, you're embarrassing me. Use your core! -Use your core! -[Nicole] Hey! You better not be recording this! -What you got? -I will sue the kid! [clamoring] -Look like a meat ball! -[clamoring] [laughter] [Spyder] What? [Diedre] Where you at, Tammy? [laughter] -God. -Daddy, help us! We're sorry, dad! -[Diedre] Dad! -Come on in now. Come on. [Nicole] I'm fallen. I can't get up! [Diedre] Oh, shut up! [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [Nicole] Hey. -What are you doing here? -[chuckles] You're going viral. My cousin posted this video on social media. -No! -[clamoring on video] -Can you sue kids? -Not at Christmas time. Don't... Don't worry, you can't really see your face in it. The folks at your bank won't see it. That doesn't even matter anyway. I got laid off last week. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that, Nikki. You're actually the first person that I told. A-are you okay? I mean, I'm okay. I guess so. You know, I have savings. And now with the lottery, it's kinda like... Lottery? You have to promise you won't tell anybody. But dad won the lottery. He made us promise to keep it a secret until we claim the prize Christmas Day. [stutters] Of course, I won't tell anyone. That's amazing! Congratulations! Mm. Mom can't remember where she hid the ticket. So no congratulations yet, but we'll find it. -[exhales] -[cell phone vibrates] Ah. It's Cherry. I'm-I'm sorry. I-I gotta go. No, it's okay. It's cool. I'm sure y'all will find the ticket. Let me know if you need anything. Okay. [mellow music] Nicole, come inside, they're about to talk about the Lonestar Christmas Lotto winner on the news! Come on! -Right now? -Yeah! Now! Lottery officials have confirmed there is a winner of the $10 million Lonestar Christmas Lotto, but they have yet to claim the prize. Yeah, that's 'cause Ms. Diane can't remember where she hid that ticket. Officials also tell KNPX that if the winning ticket isn't presented at their offices by Christmas Day at noon, they forfeit the $10 million. [sighs] Well, you heard her. We only have three days left to find this ticket. -So what's the plan, Nikki? -Yeah.

[Nicole] Look in the closet again. Tammy, did you check the ba... Where's mom, is she lost? [Nicole] Where you going? What are you checking? [Nicole] Check something. [Diedre] Everywhere. -Mm. -My goodness. I have so much... [indistinct chatter] [Gerald] Ain't in here! [Diedre] It's gotta be somewhere. [indistinct chatter] [Nicole] Are you sure you looked, Diedre? -[Nicole] What about you? -Oh, yeah, I found it. -You found it? -Yeah. -Are you serious? -No. -Spyder! -Keep lookin'! Keep lookin'! Actually, let me check your pockets. -Check my pockets? -[Tammy] Get off... [fire crackling] How is it... that you're just as beautiful as the day I married you? What if we can't find that lottery ticket? -What are you.. -[sobs] I'm such a burden. What are you talking about? The vows we made 35 years ago... for sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, never expire. But you can't keep running that restaurant and taking care of me. When we went on our first date, you were wearing perfume that smelled like magnolias. That's why you're the inspiration for my life's work. Well, I don't want to be the cause for you not getting that lottery prize. We already got the prize, Diane. Our three little girls are all home... under one roof... for the holidays. I hope they sing for me before they leave. I'm sure they will. Then we're gonna find that lottery ticket, then we're going to open up your Magnolia Music School... and then we're gonna get you the best of care, I promise. I just don't wanna forget you. I won't let you. -[indistinct screaming on phone] -[laughing] Oh, my gosh! Diedre, no! Oh, my gosh! -[laughs] -[clinking] [clinking] What are you doin'? I wanted to talk to you, so I figured I'd go old-school like when you snuck me into your room in high school. [chuckles] What do you want, Tyson? Come outside. I gotta show you something. So what is so important? [exhales] Did you find the lottery ticket yet? [scoffs] No, not yet. But we'll be back at it first thing in the morning. Then it's a good thing I came over. Oh, really? And why is that? How can you help? I brought you some good luck. Tyson, what are you talking about? It is late. I am tired. Close your eyes, Nikki. Trust me. Okay, you can open 'em now. Look up. Tyson... you know you have a girlfriend. I-I broke it off with Cherry. I know it didn't seem like it, but we only been dating for six months. And I knew when I saw you at the restaurant, you've always been the one. Mm! But you know I live in New York. [chuckles] Have you ever heard of these things called airplanes? [chuckles] Okay, very funny. So, what you think? Second time's a charm? I think... I think we should take things slow. [cell phone ringing] -What's up, Dan? -I need to know if you're in. -Davenport. -Look, I-I'm in. I just need a little bit more time to get this money together. [Dan] You got 48 hours. And, unfortunately, instead of only 50 percent of the one million, we need the full amount. One million in 48 hours? [Dan] When we lost our jobs, we knew how tough it was gonna be to launch this fund given where the markets are. Investors need to know we're serious. [sighs] So when were you gonna tell us that you lost your job? Why are you listening to my call? I just heard you say that you were gonna get a million dollars from mom and dad. Well, you don't know what you're talking about, Diedre. You are still the same selfish-ass sister that you've always been. You don't give a damn about what anyone else in this family is going through. So you need the money? If I do need the money, at least it's for something more meaningful than your stupid business. And what is that supposed to mean? Exactly what I just said. Let's just find the ticket so you can get back to New York. You know what, Diedre, you are just so... [Diane laughing] [Gerald] Oh, boy. -What is that? -What's going on down there? -Do you hear that? -I do. ♪ Come on [laughing] -[indistinct chatter] -Whoo! ♪ Dance Ooh, we haven't danced in a long time. -[Gerald] Watch it now. -Whoo! -[indistinct chatter] -All right.

[together] Shut up, Spyder! What? They seem so happy. Who doesn't seem happy when they're high, Spyder? Of course they're happy. They're high! Diedre, don't yell at my man, okay? We know we messed up. We're sorry. What about the drugs interacting with mom's medication? Did either one of you think about that? Tammy? Spyder? No, we didn't think about that. -Did you? -No. Of course not. Look, I'm gonna go call mom's doctor and see what she has to say about the gummies. How could you be so irresponsible? Look, you don't have to say anything, okay? Let's see what the doctor says, we'll look for the ticket and then we're out of here. You never have to see us again. -Want more? Okay, cool. -Give me that! [indistinct chatter] [Belinda] Cheers. [Diedre] Yes. Cheers, baby. [Belinda] Cheers. You don't wanna hear this, but you need to make up with your sisters. Belinda, they won't change. Have you changed, Diedre? Tammy still acts like a little baby making stupid decisions. Thank goodness the doctor didn't think mom's meds would be impacted by those gummies. Does Tammy still act like a baby or do you and Nicole insist on treating her like a baby? And what about Nicole? She needs a million dollars for her new business and she didn't tell us about getting laid off. I mean, who keeps secrets like that from their family? I mean, we need the money, too. And we have a secret of our own. Mm. Our secret's different. It's still a secret. Babe... Just, please make up with them. We need all the family we can get. -Please? -[sighs] -I'll think about it. -Thank you.

We have one day, one day left to find this Christmas lottery ticket. These right here are your final locations... that I want each of you to search in the house. By the end of the day we should have covered every square inch of this house and the restaurant. -Oh. -Hey. Oh. -You must want the kitchen? -Yeah. Okay, good. Thank you. Come here. Is it in this jacket? Oh, hey. Whoa, whoa. Um, this, did you look there? -Yes. -What about here? I told you, I've looked everywhere. It's gotta be here somewhere. -Here. -[groans] Thanks for heading over to start the search. Yeah. Of course. No problem. I already looked there. Matter of fact, we've looked everywhere, okay? No ticket. Okay, well, the ticket has to be in here somewhere, Diedre. -We have to look again. -[sighs] I'm so tired of taking orders from you, Nikki. I cannot wait for Christmas tomorrow so you can be on your way back home to New York. -Okay, Diedre, stop! -No! It's time for her to go. Trust me, Diedre, I'm ready to go. Good. Uh, what do you think you're doing? Cutting a piece of cake. Tyson told me Belinda's cakes always give him and his basketball team good luck. So, I don't know, maybe it'd do the same for us. I mean, besides, the restaurant's closed anyway Christmas Day, so what does it matter? That cake is for the homeless people mom invite here for Christmas. -It's family tradition. -Tradition? -Well, when did that start? -What does it matter? You're never home for family traditions anyways. [Nicole scoffs] [scoffs] No, you did not. Oh, yes, I did. Okay, this is crazy, you guys. Wha... What? [clamoring] [laughter] You are five years old. -[laughs] -[knocking on door] Belinda? Babe, what's wrong? It's your mother! She's missing! M-maybe we should be outside looking for mom, too. We looked everywhere we thought she'd go until the police told us all to stay together at home. And they'd call us as soon as they found out something. We're gonna hear from the police soon. They're going to find her. [cell phone vibrates] Is that... Well, in the meantime, why don't we just continue looking for that ticket? [sighs] Can you just... -You look... Yes, thank you. -I'm out. All right. [Spyder] Yeah. [Gerald] Where could she be? I thought she was upstairs sleeping. W-w-what if she can't find her way home? Dad, the police are gonna find her. It's just so hard watching her slip away. Oh, daddy. Look, you've done the best you could, okay? There's no one that could do any more. I was hoping to use the lottery money to hire somebody to help take care of her. None of that matters now. I should have just been focusing on her. Don't blame yourself, dad. We all could have been here, but we're here now and we are gonna help you take care of mom. [instrumental music] [sighs] Hey, baby. I can't just sit here like this. I got to go look for her. We'll go with you, daddy. -Yeah. -Let's go. [doorbell rings] Is that her? Hurry, dad, hurry. -Oh. -Mommy! -Oh! -[Nicole] Mom! Oh. Diane, we, we were worried sick about you. Are you okay? I went to go find the lottery ticket. But you've been gone for hours! You m... You must be hungry. Well, I left my wallet at home and I didn't have any money to get some food. But I did have one of those delightful candies I found in Tammy's room. Um, mom, what, you had another gummy? I did, but, and when I ate it, I remembered where I left the ticket for safekeeping and so I went to go get it. -What? -What? Where? The safest place I knew to hide something. You hid the ticket in the photo? It was the safest place. -[sighing] -Well, did you bring it home? -Oh, my God, the ticket. -Oh! Tyson, how did you know to go to the restaurant? When you called me and told me your mom was missing, I thought about the place she would go to if she was lost. And she was sitting in her booth. You must've just missed her. It was the strangest thing. And when I went into the restaurant, there was cake everywhere. We're gonna have to clean that up before the people from the shelter come for Christmas dinner. -Yes, ma'am. -For sure. Thank you, Tyson. Thank you. Merry Christmas, my beloved. Merry Christmas, husband. [laughing] I'm so happy to have you back, mommy. [Diane] Oh, I'm happy to be here. -We're so happy. -[Diane] I'm happy to be home. It's like I already told you, man. We gonna have the money tomorrow. Yeah. It's comin', bro. Well, her mom a little cuckoo for cocoa puffs and lost the ticket... It don't, it don't matter. Relax. We still will have this money tomorrow anyway. Okay. I'mma call you back, all right? All right, yeah. Mm-hmm. What's up, baby? Everything cool? Oh, did you guys find the lottery ticket? We found my mom. Thanks for asking. [sighs] I was worried. Worried about my mom's well-being? Or worried that she was cuckoo and gonna keep you from the money? Baby, come here, come here. You know that ain't... Baby, I don't know what you think you heard. But I'm happy that your mom is home safe, okay? It's two wins. You got your mom and you got the lottery ticket. No one cares about the lottery ticket anymore, Spyder. We're all just grateful my mom is home safe. We are all happy that your mom is home safe. I know that, come on, now hopefully your dad put the ticket away for safekeeping, though. He did, and tomorrow daddy is going to claim the lottery prize. Perfect! It's even better! I'm not gonna ask for any of it. [sighs] Baby, w-what do you, what do you... What do you mean you're not asking for none of the money? This week, seeing my mom struggle and my dad trying to take care of her, it's made me think. I wanna stay here in Houston and help my parents open the music school. It's my mom's dream. What about your music in Atlanta? What about Kid Genius? There are producers right here in Houston who cost a lot less. I need to stay here and take care of my family. Baby... I'm not stayin' in Houston. Then maybe you should go back to Atlanta without me. [mellow music] [Tyson] What's wrong? Why are you crying? I'm just so thankful that mom's home safe. God, I've been so selfish. I left dad and my sister here to care of my mom and to run the restaurant. W-what if you didn't find her? But I did. Nikki, your mom's home safe. You're here now, that's all that matters. I need to make some changes in my life. I don't know, maybe getting laid off was just what I needed. I've never heard somebody say losing a job was a good thing. I mean, it's given me a-a brand-new perspective. I don't know, maybe I don't need to go back to New York. Are there any other reasons why you wouldn't go back to New York? I think I can think of a few. Here's one. And another one. And another one. [laughing] -My God! -Look at her right there. What are these bags? And why is she dressed like this, though? What are y'all in here laughing at? We're looking at pictures of you in the eighth grade carrying around a briefcase. I mean, dang, sis, you've always been wound so tight. I mean, who carries their lunch to school in a briefcase? -Hm. -She does. Well, looks like someone isn't wound up so tight anymore. We saw you on the porch kissing Tyson. Mm-hmm. Doesn't Tyson have a girlfriend? You better be careful... Before you end up on Santa's naughty list for real. Oh, actually, Tyson broke up with Cherry. I guess he found somebody else he wants to kiss under the mistletoe. Oh, girl, well, you know what Santa says. -[both] Ho, ho, ho. -You know what... [laughter] -Oh, look at mommy! -Oh, so sweet. That's got to be me she's holding. -No. So it's me. -It's the cutest one. -Gotta be me. -Her head's a little big. -I think that's Tammy. -Ooh. [Tammy] Rude. It's a cute head. I think we should talk about mom. Yeah. I agree. I'm not going back to New York. It's not right that you and Belinda are the only support that dad has. Me, too. I told Spyder I wasn't going back to Atlanta. And what about the dream of you having a singing career? I can pick up singing gigs right here in Houston, and help with the music school, and help dad take care of mom. And I'll be here, too. Thank you guys so much. You don't have to thank us, Diedre. We're sisters. [instrumental music] Oh, give me a hug!
