Manuel! Manuel, hurry up or I'll leave you here! - I'm already there. You need more time than a woman. There is so much to do in Carterville. What did you put on your hair? Are you going to visit the governor? Not the governor. Four French girls have arrived. They dance the can-can and drive the whole town mad. Come on! Manuel! Hold on, I forgot something. Collect money in exchange for this gold. But watch out! Keep a close eye on it. Especially when weighing. Don't worry, Dad. See you later, father. Give me the reins, Lisa! - Let me! Hold on! Shut up, Lisa. This is where I need to be. Hey, I have to bring provisions for the whole month. I'm not going to have time today to help you. Bye! I should have known. I'll do it alone. You are strong enough and you know that. Manuel! Shall we go for a ride? Please. Father gave me a beautiful new horse. Fine, but I've had enough of horses for a while. I haven't seen you in almost a month. I have so much to tell you. I don't like to disappoint you but I'll see you soon, Rosa. Manuel... Good morning, Mr. Barnett. - Good morning. I'm already out of beans today... and I expect the cornmeal even by tomorrow. Then I'll have to come back tomorrow. I'll have to come anyway. To get Manuel out of jail. - And then I might have what you need. Are you succeeding? Let me, Miss. Not really. This is not a job for a sheriff. Not even for a young lady like you. Your brother should be ashamed. I'm used to this work. I know, but... it can't be easy for a woman alone. Take care of the ranch and watch two men. How is Diego? Haven't seen him here in weeks. My father is doing well. Thank you. And what about gold mining? You're going to get rich soon, aren't you? From what we find there? I do not think so. Good morning, Mr. Miller. - Hello Lisa. Bye, sheriff. Why don't you want a helping hand, Miss? Here's the bill, Lisa. Did you know... that almost all men escaped from Francisco's gang? Just across the border. Then maybe your other brother will come back soon. I hope he's still alive. Is that right, sheriff? You must be happy to see him again after all this time. Thanks for the help, sheriff. Always at your service, Miss Lisa. That's what I'm here for. Nice to see you. I do not understand. When I started talking about him she blushed like a bride. Like a woman does when... Sheriff who? Him who? That other brother of hers. They call him... Gringo. You never miss with your left hand, do you? Francisco, flee while you still can, I cover you. No, Gringo, we're fighting it out here. I stay with you. Are you crazy ? Just a little while and we'll be trapped. Come on, get out of here. Quick, I'll cover you. We did it. Here they passed. - Then we have to go over there. There they are. Stop! We can't go any further. This is the border with the United States. It's done, friend. Not a brave way to die. - What are you saying, Francisco? Dying on the run... and on the wrong side of the Rio Grande. But it's better this way. There's nothing there for me anymore. But you don't make the same mistakes I did. You... Francisco! You must be very thirsty, Manuel. You can be sure of that. My throat is bone dry. That I'm so thirsty because of that work in the mine. Stay out of it, Manuel. Thank you. You're a good guy, Manuel. Is this private or can anyone play? Senor Kincaid? Did you say something, Zeke? I haven't said a word yet. Did someone say something? Not me. You shouldn't look at me. Then I must be wrong. Who wears a sheepskin? Or is there a sheep nearby? What is this, "Snow-white" Kincaid? Something wrong with the color? How long before you buy the whole town? When we're done with our mine, we buy all of Texas. You'll have to share by four, right, Manuel? Only three, Senor Kincaid. My brother Gringo fights for glory in Mexico. We take the glory we find here. Cards? One. None for me. Two. The dealer takes three. I open. And I raise with this. I understand. Not me. I want to see you. What have you got, brother? Winning cards, Zeke. You lost, Martinez. - No! No! That is impossible! Show your cards, Wilson. I'm not offended by a dirty Mexican. Dirty Mexican! You dirty Mexican! Act normal! Let me. Come on, Manuel. We go to my room. Come on, back to your seat. The show is over. Thanks Sanchez, I can do it now. And now stop drinking. I don't think that dirty Mexican knew what a dirty game you played. Hey, Senor Wilson. What do you look like? You should be ashamed of the way you behaved last night in town. You were as drunk as a cannon. I bet there's not a drop of whiskey more in Carterville. Can't I have some fun sometimes? Sure, but not afterwards to lie in bed all day. Good morning dad. - Here's your sister. Why aren't you like her, Manuel? Your dinner is ready at the ranch, father. Go get some rest. - Thank you, my child. If you want food you have to finish your work first. I'm going a little higher... you make the water way too dirty for the laundry. What a luck ! I don't even want to hear your sermon. How stupid! You didn't have to kill him. Do not worry. Take the gold. Come on, get out of here! Father! Ricardo, my son. You're back! Father, who were those men? Don't know. Three men with their faces covered. Manuel... Lisa. Take care of them. Let that revolver... and get out of here, or I'll shoot you! Lisa! Don't you recognize me anymore? Gringo! I could have killed you. How could I know it was you. I saw a strange horse outside... Don't mind, honey, don't mind. Who shot? - Don't know. I found him here on the floor. Who? Father. Calm down, Lisa. Manuel! Bring me some tequila or whiskey and some connection. Father, where is he? Murdered. I'll kill these cowards! Run, Lisa. You've been gone so long... More than four years. Are you staying here for a while now? Yes, I'm staying forever now. Those three masked men? - Yes. How do you know? I've seen them. What did they come here to do? What did they want? - Our gold. How many? - Enough to kill for. It was hidden in a hole under the table. So that no one would find it. - They've got it anyway. Now try to be a little calm. Is Dr. Bancroft still in town? Yes, he's still there. What are you going to do? - I'm coming with you. Leave that gun alone you don't need that there. You better stay with Manuel and our dad. If I've seen the doctor I also speak to the sheriff. If old Riley's still that fast, I don't need a gun. Maybe. Because Riley's been dead for years. We've got another sheriff now, Lance Corbett. And he's certainly not as fast as old Riley. Especially when he has to help Mexicans. I could offer him my help. What happened to you, Gringo? I don't know you like that. You never offered help. You've always been a loner... and you were always right to help yourself. I've acted alone for far too long, Lisa. What I want is peace and law and order in my life. Law and order, you say. There is only one law that counts. And you know which one that is. The law of survival. And that means killing before you get killed. I am going to the doctor... You put that revolver aside. Right now. Welcome to Carterville. Here are the remains of it Tom 'Mad dog' Bowers and Red 'Trigger' Jones. Hanged by law by Sheriff J.R. Riley for the Cassidy murder March 2, 1869 Doctor! Doctor Bancroft! Gringo! My boy! Wait, I'll be right over. Where is he? Welcome home, welcome Ricardo. How long have you been gone? Way too long. Let's go have a drink. We should celebrate this. There's trouble at the ranch, Doctor. When I got home I found my father shot. Is it bad ? - Three masked men killed him. They stole the gold and injured Manuel. Where did he get hit? - In the chest, just below the right shoulder. I took care of him but you must go and see. I quickly get my bag. What a sad homecoming, Ricardo. Do you mind going alone? I have something to do here. AS you wish. Do you know who they were? - No. Not yet. But I do find them. Sheriff Corbett? What do you want from him? Are you the sheriff? - One of his helpers. I'd like to speak to Sheriff Corbett personally. He is not here. Come back later. - I will. You're Gringo, aren't you? - Yes, and who are you? Rosa Cardenas, daughter of the blacksmith. Don't you recognize me anymore? I remember a little skinny girl. Not the lady of today. Manuel says I am still that little girl. Tell him he's wrong. - He doesn't listen to me. Let me do it. Bye! Hey Gringo! What a surprise! Where have you been for so long? You don't look too good. Come in, we'll fix you up. Sit down. Okay, shaving then. - Shall we. See if I survive this, after all this trouble that I had, over the border. As always, Gringo? You don't even have a face to... sorry, friend. Didn't you see three Mexicans here, today or yesterday? Think carefully. Two of them were big, the other was smaller. Two of the horses were brown, the other grey. I do not think so. You didn't see many Mexicans here recently. Is it that important? - They killed my father. Okay, enough for today. This one is on me. You have changed, Maria. The local too. More or less? - Much better. I noticed that things are going well for you. I am happy for you. Come on, let me introduce you to my friends. Let's get acquainted. Ricardo Martinez, an old friend of mine. Lou Stedman, my partner. Pleasant introduction. I've heard a lot about you. Welcome home. - Thank you. And what was it like in Mexico? - Bad, but it's getting better. And in Texas? Excellent. - I see. These are the Wilson brothers, Zeke and Kincaid. My dear customers. Livestock dealers. An old friend of mine, Ricardo Martinez. Martinez? That's Mexican, isn't it? That's true. You dress like them, but you don't look like them any more than I do. You don't even smell like them. He was adopted by Diego, when he was a child. What does a Mexican smell like, Wilson? - Don't listen to Zeke, he's drunk. Answers my question, Wilson. Can't take a joke, amigo? - Let me explain, Kincaid. Martinez was with those perverts so long, that he has already forgotten. You can easily lose the influence of that smell. No, Gringo! Put that gun away. What was all that? These gentlemen had a little disagreement, sheriff. Nothing important. Who are you ? Ricardo Martinez. Back in town for the first time. I already told you about him. They call him Gringo. He gets excited rather quickly. You'll have to keep yourself under control, if you want to stay here. There are people I don't want to see offended. Who? My family. Same as offending me. No one is insulting you, Martinez. It was for fun. Very low, Kincaid. I've had enough of your jokes, there is no room for that here. As long as I'm here you keep a low profile. You shut up or I run you out! I don't want any more trouble from either of you. Okay, sheriff. There have been no problems for a while. Hopefully it stays like that, Martinez. There's trouble already, sheriff. That's why I'm here, but you weren't at your office. I'm here now. What is it? Three men raided our ranch. They killed my father. How bad, Gringo, Poor Diego. He never hurt anyone. Who does such a thing? I wish I knew. What's the damage? Three tables, four broken chairs and a railing. Together $3.25. Here! Let's go. Sit down. Bring us a bottle. This is bad. I understand your mood. And those three men? - They were masked. I saw them riding away from the ranch. They left my father for dead. Mexicans? - I couldn't see that! That's true, sorry. But I'll tell you what everyone thinks. I'm not against Mexicans. I am against bandits of any kind. I tell you, if it was Mexicans, they are already over the border. They headed for Carterville. That doesn't mean anything. But when they're in Carterville, I will find them. Your whiskey, sheriff. Are you sure this is all what can you tell about them? Two of them rode a brown horse. The third on a gray. I'll take note of that. - Is that how you work, sheriff? I understand your feelings, Martinez. But I manage to maintain law and order without anyone complaining about me. Don't fight them now. Forget it. Leave that to me. - I will, sheriff. I'm tired of fighting. I just want to rest. That's what I strive for. I looked up at Diego. He raised me. Don't make me forget this. Or I'll do the job myself. - Like I said... Leave it to me. I'll see you. Hello, Gringo, welcome back. I just heard from your father. If there's anything I can do then let us know. Thank you, Don Esteban. Glad to see you. Hey Sheriff! Sheriff Corbett! What is it now, Martinez? Number one, sheriff. Two more to go. Juan Guardo, what does this mean? He comes to Carterville every month. Why do you suspect him? He ambushed me in the canyon. - He's Mexican. Like I told you. This one was. How do I know you're telling the truth? I'm telling you. Is my word not good enough? All right, this time I'll believe you. You'd better watch out though with that gun of yours. I'd rather do this the legal way. understood? You're the sheriff. It seems that the peace has disappeared in Carterville. I think so too. Is one of our horses missing a horseshoe? No, not that I know of. Are you sure? - Yes. From one of the robbers? Maybe. But no real proof. - Better than nothing. How many people know about the gold, Manuel? A lot, I think. That is no secret in the area. They must have known the hiding place. Maybe not, but they did find it. They knew about the hole under the table. So they knew very well where it was. They went straight for it. Who did you tell, Manuel? I think of Maria Huertas. - Maria? I don't remember very well. I was in the saloon the night before. Played poker with those mean Wilsons. They've seen my gold. I lost it there, I think. Who was still there? - Just the usual. I remember talking to Maria. I don't know how I got home. It's all my fault. - How so ? What happened to father. You were drunk and out of your mouth. You didn't kill him. Whoever did it they know everything about us, Manuel. And they want something else. What else would they want? Our soil. What are you doing, Lisa? I'm looking for my undershirt. Stupid question! Why don't you ask for help? You're so busy fooling around, I didn't want to disturb you. Sometimes you find interesting things by fooling around. If the sheriff wants proof... I'm sure I have a serious clue for him. Evidence. By the time it gets to the sheriff, you have already lost it. Don't count on him! He represents the law. Sometimes you have to exercise some patience. Isn't patience a feminine quality? That's true. That's why I'm so happy that I am a woman and not a man. Look, do you see what's happening now? Come here I help you. You can lift that wagon by yourself. I want to speak to Maria. Is she coming? No, she's in her room. She wanted to rest. Headache or something. Who is there? - It's me. Nice office you have here. - Are you here on business? Could be. It didn't turn out the way I wanted. It isn't, Maria. You've been gone for 4 years. A woman cannot wait. It's not that simple for us. - You did the right thing. What was to become of me? A nun? You can't blame me for that. I hope you understand. - Naturally. Do you drink anything? - Certainly. On what once was? - The good old days. Was my brother here the night before my father was killed? Yes, he was here. He was drunk. You know how he is. He won't stop drinking. Towards evening he became noisier and roared how rich he was. And then he had a fight with the Wilsons. I brought him here 50 he could get some sleep. Later I was able to put him on his horse on the way to the ranch. I took this from him. I was afraid he would lose it. That is the truth. You believe me, don't you? You have to believe me, Gringo. You have to believe me! Only after 4 years do you decide to return, but now... are you in a hurry to make up for your lost time to catch up. You shouldn't look at me. Continue. What were you talking about? Ricardo had questions about Manuel. I told him what happened that night. Why are you so nervous, Maria? Do you want something to drink ? I see you already have. I'm getting one too. I found a horseshoe on the ranch. But not our horses. Could be one of the killers. It's moving forward, Martinez. I'm not there vet... but... like I said... this case belongs to the Mexican authorities. We'll never find the killers here. Where is Guardo's horse? In the stable of confiscated animal is. Can I see it? Don't worry. Maybe it's missing a horseshoe... but... don't shoot it! I only shoot wanted people. Good night, Maria. - Goodbye, Ricardo. That Gringo... Are you glad he's back, Maria? Why wouldn't I? We are old friends. What do you want? I want to see Guardo's horse. Well I don't know... - Sheriff's permission. In that case... No, this is not what I was looking for. Can you judge a horse through his horseshoes? That's how I do it. Do you have any others? Is that for sale? - No, that's from Mr. Stedman. I'm sure he's not selling it. Maybe if I pay enough. - Does not matter. Is the horseshoe here? Do you really want to buy a horse? No, I'm looking for the horse of my father's killer. I'll teach you, friend! Just wait... Call me a murderer! Throw a bucket of water over him. Was there a fight? - He's going to the blacksmith. Who did your father work for recently? My father is eating supper now. Sorry about that, but it is very important to me. He doesn't mind. How's Manuel? Better? - Much better. Rose. Tell me... That night when he was so drunk. Did you see him leave then? - No. I then waited for him for a long time. Do you know who did it yet, Gringo? I am not sure. But I'm on a good track. Don't worry about Manuel. I'm going to call my father. Good evening. Sit down. What can I do for you? Sorry for the late hour, it's just for a while. Take your time, Martinez. I ate so much that needs to go down! I heard shooting at the blacksmith, call a doctor! Now I understand what you said about shooting certain people. Give me your weapons. I didn't shoot. It came from outside. I shot from the window on someone who ran away. I only heard one shot. I only heard one shot. I'm telling you it came from outside. I didn't shoot him. Why would I? Wherever you go people die. I have warned you, but you wanted it your way. I have to lock you up. Do you still think that my father's killers be over the border? While I was talking to this man, did someone kill him. In the middle of the city. Someone who wants me dead too. Why don't you do something about it, sheriff? That's your story, Martinez. Everyone knows your reputation, your violent nature... and the kind of life you always led. This city was quiet and peaceful, until you came back. And if something needs to be fixed, I do it my way. And I'll put you behind bars if I want it. I heard 2 shots. Like Ricardo said. That's right, sheriff. Two shots. I heard them right. Are you sure, Don Esteban? Sometimes we hear what we want to hear. Especially with friends in trouble. I'm sure I wasn't mistaken. I heard two shots. I also heard two shots. And Martinez is no friend of mine. One can always be wrong. I don't know how come but then I was wrong. Listen... You want to do Carterville a big service? Get out of town and stay away! And let me do my job in peace. Then show it off, sheriff. You have work lined up for you. What do you have? something wrong? I am full of admiration. Yes finally! I've got a picnic. Why? A peace offer? If you like. - Naturally. How did you get those clothes? - From my mother. Do you like them? Wonderful. Glad you like them. I didn't mean you your clothes! Nice compliment for a lady! Sorry, I think you're crazy in that outfit. Is that right? I'll teach you to laugh with me! Richard! Come back! You rascal! Richard! Come back! Now we have forgotten our picnic. - I'm not hungry vet. Just fine here. Gringo... sometimes I even forget your other name. The Mexican kids gave you that name. They always teased me that I had a strange brother. But I was proud of it. He had something special. They didn't have a brother like you. I remember when we were little. We were happy, weren't we? How we played here. I often dreamed that I was here. When I was in Mexico with Francisco, I often looked at the sky... and dreamed of this fine place. And if I looked at another river, then I saw our river. So peaceful and quiet. How I longed for this place. I told Francisco. I've had enough of fighting but he... he loved his country too much. What horrible things I've seen. All that bloodshed. Everything has changed, Lisa. We probably too. I love you Gringo still. A man can grow up, thinking that girl is his sister. And then suddenly... I never thought of you as a brother. - Yet... You gringos talk too much. What are you doing now? I'm testing my arm. Everything is fine again. Are you ready for a dance party? Mind your business. Try to hit the target first, Jesse James. Are you laughing at me, Miss Martinez? Let's see if you can do better. But beware, this thing hits back fiercely. So watch out for your beautiful teeth. I know what you're thinking Manuel, forget it. I can not do that. Father died because of me, how can I forget that? I'm not asking you that. I'm just as impatient as you. But we have to wait for the right time. Hold on for a while longer. You don't have to risk anything. Bravo! I'll keep practicing. That can't hurt, can it? Not for you, no! Hi, Manuel. What will it be? - Whiskey. It's so quiet today. You hardly see anyone. Good morning, Manuel. - Hello Doctor. Don't call for help! One word and it will be your last. Are you drunk? I don't know you like that. - Come on, open that safe. Why Manuel? What interests you what's in it? We'll see when it opens. Show what's there. Come! Explain this to us and no lies! If you don't want me to kill you then tell me the truth. I have nothing to do with this. I had to hide it from them. Who? Who was it? Leave it, Manuel. - He found it, Lou. Hand it over. Hand it over, I said. Manuel shot Stedman! Stedman has been killed! It was Martinez. - Gringo, right? - No, his brother Manuel. He's got the gold. Come on, men! What happened? - Manuel threatened me with a gun. Look, our gold. From Maria's safe in her room. Stedman was the thief. He wanted to kill me but I was faster. Where's Corbett? - He's after me. Take my horse and leave as soon as possible. Right now? - Yes, right now! But I fired in self-defense. why can't I stay here? Because you're Mexican. And Corbett doesn't like Mexicans. I don't want him to find you here. Go away, Manuel. Hurry. You can hide in the old sheepfold. I'll still visit you. Go now. If it wasn't you then your brother, huh Martinez? Come on, where is he? Don't know. I do not believe you. - Hold on, sheriff. I lead this posse, Mr. Miller! Ricardo, we accuse your brother of robbery and murder. Those are very serious crimes. Theft and murder? Is it murder if you defend yourself? This bag belongs to my father. Everyone recognizes them. That's right, sheriff. Is it a crime to retrieve what was stolen from us? Like your brother did. That's my job. He should have come to me. What did our gold do in Maria's vault? And who killed Cardenas? I was on Stedman's trail. I would have captured him sooner or later. If Manuel hadn't acted himself. He was within his right to do so. Number two, sheriff, one more to go. Enough, Martinez! Where's Manuel? Search around the ranch. You, Zeke, search the house. Kincaid, you too. We smoke it out. I ran into a feral cat, Sheriff. Get out! Go away! Watch out Zeke! Get rid of your revolver, Gringo. Take off your belt. Not with your left hand. Use your right hand, Gringo. AS you wish. This was your last crime, Martinez. This time the law will speak. Zeke was officially part of this posse. You'll hang for this, Martinez. Are you going to hang me, sheriff? In a legal way? - Unless you spare me now. Get a rope and tie him up. Take him with you, he's going to face justice. You were better off without that Gringo. Don't you agree Lisa? I'll give you until tomorrow morning to bring Manuel. Otherwise, Gringo will hang. Corbett, when do you plan to hold the trial? I can not say. But he definitely comes first. I count on a fair trial. Mr. Miller, I'm the sheriff. And I'll decide on that. Good evening. - Never mind, Miller. What's that for? - What do you think ? He killed my brother. I don't like pointless violence. Come on in. How is Maria? - I just can't calm her down. She doesn't want to rest or go to bed. All she does is drink coffee. You better drop by. I'll pay attention to this. Why is she so worried. I'm here. What time is it? - It is 4 o'clock. Almost day. I'm going to have a look. Don't leave here. - Do not worry. Try to get some sleep, Maria. You worry for nothing. I can't rest, |I can't sleep. And you don't have to be with me either. We're almost there now. Everything is going according to plan. How can you say that? Diego murdered... Cardenas killed and now Stedman. One murder after another. I didn't want that! Try to calm down, Maria! The hardest part is now behind us. Gringo is imprisoned. And as soon as we get Manuel there will be no problems with that girl. We can then live on the ranch and get married. I'm not going there, I'm not setting foot in there. I do not want it! I didn't want any of this, Lance. What I really wanted... Don't upset yourself like that. Just say what you want. I would give you everything. I want to forget everything. How can I? If only I could forget all about that, Lance. You're dead tired. Raise your hands and shut your mouth. Go inside! Forward! Take off your hat off, Kincaid. - Why? Take it off, can't you see there is a lady present? What are you up to ? Are you crazy? - Come on, don't waste any time. Is he dead? - No, he's asleep. And a headache later... - Come on, get away from here! Wait a second! That came from prison! You come with me. He escaped! Ringo escaped! Manuel and Lisa helped him. I was totally surprised. We must prevent them to get to their horses. You go to the stables there. Two to the saloon. The rest comes with me. Watch the street. The rest follow me. Where are the horses? - With Rose. That was the best place. We have to cross the street. There is light. Go check it out, Kincaid. I'm going, sheriff. - The others split up. Hey, Ms. Carter! Is someone with you? - No, nobody's here. Try over there. Go! Harry, check out the blacksmith. - Yes, Sheriff. And also look around the Mexican warehouse. Come on, we shouldn't be here. Being quiet. Stay behind each other. They can't be far, sheriff. Go back. Who is there? Come on. Back to the stables. They must have taken the horses. Now! Stop! Now! Who is there? - Stand still! Harry, what's wrong with you? Don't you recognize me anymore? You're even more nervous than when I run my knife across your Adam's apple. I'll buy you a drink, okay? - Good idea! Yes, yes, you have to eat. You had almost nothing yesterday. Who is there? Then answer! Then I'll go see for myself. Let's see who it is. Gringo! What a surprise. You bring the whole family. I think it's a strange hour to visit someone. Sorry, Doctor, but this was the best place that we could find. I thought it was weird all that shooting. But in my profession, I always try to be deaf in that kind of music. Is it you, doctor? Get out before it's too late. Leave that to me. Go upstairs. Do not worry. I believe we will soon settling down with a lot of bodies, eh sheriff? How long have you been here, doctor? Half an hour, about. Why? Just like that. Come on, nobody's here. I'm sure they're still here somewhere. I think so too, sheriff. we'll keep going until we find them. Come on, let's keep looking. Follow me, men. That's one of them! Come after him! Mary. Mary! Whose horse is this? - Van Corbett. He often asks me for his horse 10 put here. Why? It's just steamed up. I was looking for that horse. - Why? It belonged to one of the killers. Do you recognize this horse? It's yours, Corbett! Number three! Finished? Stay out of here, Lisa. Go inside. Use your right hand... Gringo. As you wish, Corbett.
