What is it? Is nothing. Does Jenny know? I'm the man of the house, Tom. I do not hide anything from my wife. I will not tell her. I appreciate it. Try this. Nicotine is not your problem. It's your oral fixation. You just need something to suck on. I read it in a magazine. What kind of magazine have you read? Calm down. A man has to be able to have something alone. How many shooters did you tell? Five. Six. Someone broke them. All I know is we've lost two damn years of work. Want to take a look? As long as it's just a look. Three. Three. * ROGUE: THE KILLER * Son of a bitch! Hey, Tom. Support is coming. FBI, stopped! Tone! Jesus Christ! John! John, are you okay? Yes. Come on. Did you get him? Yes, I got it. Are you sure? I put a face in it. He is dead. Relax. The morgue is full of people... who thought they'd got that bastard. What are you talking about, John? You look like you know this guy. No. They say the Yakuza hired an independent killer... to take care of Triads. It's supposed to be the best. The same shooter the CIA used in Jakarta that one time. The same guy who turned on the coaches, then killed three agents. I heard there were five of them. This is bullshit story, John. You know that, right? Rogue is a ghost. He is a myth. Someone from the agency is trying to upset you. Titanium capsules, empty uranium bullets. It's your signature. Do you really think Rogue was working for the Yakuza? That's the problem with this business. You never know who you are working for. This is the San Francisco Police. Stay where you are and with your hands raised. Yes. He's right here. He's right here, John. See you later. All right, see you later. Tell him not to smoke in front of children. If he wants to smoke, go to the backyard. It's all right. It's all right! I thought he was stopping. I thought so, too. Hey, Tom! I got you! Daniel, please. It's ok. I'm on the phone. Come on, come on. You better get on the road. The game starts in half an hour. I'm on my way. If we do not take traffic... We arrived in half the time. John. It's a fixation. Hey, come on. Get your coat. So, how's the case going? John, forget the case. Enjoy your license. Do you know who screwed up the operation? Do not. The investigations are in progress. Until now, nothing. Someone spoke. Someone inside. Close to us. Do you know what happened to Rogue? No, they did not find the body. They drained the bay for three days... it's nothing. By now it's fish food. It's ok. Game day today, right? Yes, I know that. Just tell me you did not forget the steaks, right? No, idiot. I did not forget the steaks. Wow, when are you gonna stop this? Diane asked to see you. She also asked me... Yes, yes, yes. I heard. No smoking in front of children. Honey, we have to stop and get some steaks. Diane, are not they here yet? No! Please! No! Diane, what was that? Diane? No! No! No! John. John. Darling. Darling. Darling. My God! Stay with Daniel, my dear. Where do you think you're going? What happened? I would have to... We have three fatalities. What? A man, a woman and a child. Hey, hang on, buddy. FBI or not... Sir, the criminal investigation team must finish. We have to let them do the work. Sir? You have to get out of here now. "SAN FRANCISCO THREE YEARS LATER" "YAKUZA DISTRICT" Hello, dear. I'm next. Get him! Daito, together! What is this drug? Rogue Do you know what Shiro does to the traitors? These Japanese really know how to party. IT IS. This is looking like a pigsty. Shut up please. See all those tattoos? Japanese Yakusa. Each of those stripes... represents a bastard they killed. We have some bad men here. IT IS? What are the people who did it then? Make way. Get these people out of here. And who the hell are you? Asian Organized Crime Unit. We assume from here. With what authority? The Major's, the President's, choice. You do not look very Asian to me. I'm surprised you have not solved the case yet. Did you check this out, Einstein? Yeah. Someone cut the cables. There is nothing there. Agent Crawford? I found this in the back room. We found him hiding under one of the bodies. He looks awful. Yes. What did he say? You're kidding me, right? Who can understand all this shit? This staff comes to this country... and you think they at least learn the language. Do you think a pair of cops who work in a full district... Will Yakuzas Want to Learn Japanese? If they were not completely idiots... Give me a minute with him, okay? Hello. I'm a cop. What happened here? You know what I do when I'm not a cop? Earring of doctor. Hey! You can not do that! If I do not take this bullet away... will infect. I caught. No, this is a bone. Excuse. You want me to go back to my normal job... so give me something to do! I wanna die... before he comes back. Well, I see it's going to be a party to work with. You will not work with me. This case is from the FBI now. Do you want to help? Take my shirts to the laundry. So what do you think? A lot of Japanese bullshit. Vindictive spirits. Ghost stories. Jen? Yes. Did I wake you? It's almost nine o'clock. I worked late last night. Well, I just called to remind you... that Daniel has the first basketball game this Friday. You forgot, did not you? No. I'm just a little tired. See you. My head is full now. Right. And what is it this time? I found it, Jen. Found who? The guy who killed Tom. He returned. I can feel. This time I'm going to break up with him. John, it's been three years. Look, your obsession with this man has already cost you our marriage. Do not lose your child. Tell Daniel I'll be there. No! Tell you. If you say you will be there, then be there. For those of you who did not meet him last night, this is Agent Goi. Recently trained in Quantum. What is your specialty? Oxford. What's the fun? In other words, he is a spectator. Is that you? T.D. Defensive Tactics. That's it. I like to get close and personally. IT IS. Well, my gun is bigger than yours. Choose a table. We're still getting along. Deep down. These are all the photos that exist of Rogue. The guy does plastic on his face every six months. Come on, John? Anyone can use titanium capsules and DU bullets. The ones that were found... The ones that were found... last night combined with the findings three years ago. The Rogue is back. Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza... Why would he kill the Yakuza? Maybe he changed sides. It would not be the first time. Which side are we talking about? Shiro Yanagawa. He commands all Yakuza activity in Japan. Probably the most powerful man in San Francisco... and yet he never set foot on American soil. It is half the reason why this task force has been brought together. Li Chang is the other half. Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here. In a beautiful mansion in Marin. You think it's JD Rockefeller, or something. He has 4-89. Chief of Triad. You're into everything. Bribery, extortion, murder, just choose. Thirty years ago the Shiro massacred Chang's family. And still had the courage to fly to Hong Kong... and kill the whole clan. He spent the next 30 years selling all the goods of the Chang dynasty... for collectors and museums. The only thing left is a pair of horses. Statuettes. Two, this size. They say Shiro is looking for a buyer right now. For the Chang losing the honor means more than his financial loss. I do not care about the losses. I do not care for family offspring or family intrigues. For the first time in three years, we have a chance to catch the Rogue. All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen... is to pull the fucking trigger. "MANSION CHANG MARIN COUNTY - CALIFORNIA" She is of a very rare breed. Andalusian. That's my wife, Maria. In my father's time, such a union would not be possible. But times have changed. Those who accompanied this change... survive. Come here. I'm very impressed, Mr. Shaw. Now that you have shed the blood of my enemies... Let's drink to our new partnership. I have to admit... I had some doubts when you, for the first time, came up with the proposal. But leaving Shiro was a wise move on his part. But it makes me think. How to be able to trust a man... Who betrayed your master? I have no master. So do not betray anyone. So tell me... my horses, will they arrive tonight? It's been thirty years. All this time, my family lived in shame and disgrace. All because of Shiro's betrayal. Tonight, I'm going to get back what they stole from my family. And everything will be different from here on out. Shiro's men will protect his treasure with their lives. Are you sure you can get them back? I said I can do it. These two are the Ti brothers. They will give you everything you need. I'll get in touch. Watch him closely. "COMPOSITE OF YAKUZA TOHOKU - JAPAN" I beg you pardon. It was not your fault, it was mine. I'm the one who got my guard down. I believe you have news of San Francisco. Yes, everything is going as planned. And the horses? We've already transported them by boat. They will arrive in San Francisco tonight. You must return to San Francisco... before my arrival. But, Father... I do not trust our people there. They have become too lazy to be useful. I was hoping to stay here... and play my part in the clan. Nothing in the history of our clan... was already so important. I will not let you down. Now go. Watch the sale of the horses. "CHINESE AREA SAN FRANCISCO" Hey, what's going on, man? I'd like to see Benny. There's no Benny here. We need to talk. I do not talk to feds. Somewhere private. Now. My fighter is really losing. Business is good. Too much for National Security, right? So, how's the family? Daniel's fine. Now Jen, that's another story. I really liked her. How did you end it all? It was not difficult. Anyway, thanks for everything there. You make me look good. I hope this helps. The people I track down expect the FBI to pay a visit like this. Makes me look legitimate. Was that in the Interpol manual? Come on, John. There is no science to catch cheaters. You know that. They just said they had something for me. Yes. Our friend in Brussels, the guy who makes those titanium bullets. I met him two days ago. So I checked to see if anyone connected to Rogue... was having some problem. Last week, a plastic surgeon in Panama accidentally... cut himself with a kitchen knife while making a turkey sandwich. A week before, one more of our fellow surgeons from Florida... was swimming naked. He found some crocodiles. Looks like he did not read the signs. Anyway, these guys, they specialize in facial reconstruction. Both. Our man is leaving clues. Well, there's another surgeon gone. I think he might still be alive. Maybe it's hidden. Let me know as soon as he shows up. He is mine. Button the shirt, this is not a nightclub. Is that our contact? Yes, my contact. Get rid of him. He is my brother. Is with me. Who does this guy think he is? Get back in the car. Wu, please. He's a stranger. Go! Do not make me repeat it. After you finish this... You and I are going to talk. The horses are intact. Shiro will be grateful. We will contact you when we get there. Are the horses safe with these people? Of course, as far as they know... they're just handing over cars. Remain calm and cooperate. It's just a routine operation. I need them out of the car. Both. Put your hands where I can see them. Officer, we belong to Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises. You're making a big mistake. We have a deal. Out of the car! Let's go! Turn around. We have a gun holding license. Call your captain! Shut up. He can confirm this for us. Shut up! Damn corrupt cops... I told you to shut up! Good evening. Captain Andrews? What the fuck is this? What about our agreement? It's just a little change of plan. I need my money. Now. And then we can go? Yes. Can go. Wait here a second. Let me and my boys go first. Let's go. Do it. Mr. Chang sends his regards. "CHANG DEPOSIT - 16" Greetings from Mr. Chang. There's something serious here, man. Yakuzas, all of them. All in a row. Shots in the back. Execution style. Excuse. The criminal lab wants to know if they can come. It was a robbery. What? Notice the space between these two Sedans. These guys were escorting something big. Whatever it was, it must have been important. They were the guard dogs. But they left their guns in the cars. Only one thing would stop these guys from leaving. Cops. At least they thought they were cops. Wait a minute, are you saying that cops did this? If they did not, they were involved... No way! For all we know, it may have been one of you. I suppose you know who I am. You're the bitch of Shiro Yanagawa. Is not that you, Captain? And the person who gives free-for-all to his boys for the fucking contraband. And he's the one who betrayed you last night. I do not know what you're talking about. I never found him. This is a federal matter. Look at this! Look down the pipe and tell me if you can see the bullet. Can you see her? Yes! He said he would kill me. He said he would kill my family. Who? Who said that? I do not know who it was. Who? I do not know who it was! He works for the Triads. He works for the Changs! He knows where I live. You know where my kids go to school! You fool. What do you think Shiro Yanagawa will do... when he finds out that you screwed him up? Take his statement, and call the officers. Put your family on protection. Damn it! Get down, get down, get down! Everyone on the floor! There's a sniper on the roof. It's him. This is Agent Wick. I need support from the chase squad and an ambulance at Sloan. Now! Hold on, you shit. Anything! This guy was gone. The Triads made me a fool. Kill. Kill them all. Give me the order... and I make them disappear. Do it. Find them. I want the heads of all of them. Nobody told me that you were the boss now. Welcome, Kira-san. Your presence is an honor. And your stupidity insults my father. We were just arguing... I have direct orders from Shiro. You must not do anything until he sends it. The horses were stolen! If we do not retaliate... Want to disobey my father? Great. I want a salad. I just got off a 14-hour flight. I want a salad. Can someone get me a salad? Of what What kind? The Chef. No blue cheese. No blue cheese. Takada. With the sauce on the side, please. Bitch! Yes. Special Agent Crawford. Who is it? A messenger. Messenger? Was the police commander in the restaurant part of your message? He was a corrupt cop. I just did what you wanted to do. What do you know about what I want, you bastard? I saw it in your eyes, John. IT IS? What you saw? Hate, anger. Loneliness. Let's do this way... Why do not we meet in my office and discuss this? Do you want stolen cargo? Deposit 16. One hour. "DEPOSIT OF THE CHANG - 16" What? Are not you happy to see us? This is a private property. We have an invitation. We came to enjoy, dear. Li Chang. Still pretending to be honest? Pay attention to what you say. You're forgetting who you're talking to here. Open it. I said open it. Open it! Put your hands behind your head! Now! Bastard! Put your hands up, you bastard! No guns. He's clean. Victor Shaw. Is that what you call it now? Hong Kong Passport. And a gun license issued in Tokyo. Check them out. Check the warehouse. Make sure there is nothing hidden. And you are not? I remember your eyes. There is something very familiar about them. It's the only thing that surgeons can not change, is it? Your eyes. Although they did an excellent job on the rest. They would not even know it's the same man. But it is, is not it? I know it is. What makes a Yakuza killer work for the Triads? I know you understand me. It was you on the phone, was not it? What? Do not you remember? Maybe you will remember my partner. You remember, do not you? Do you remember his name? Tom Lone. Remember his wife? Diane. From her four-year-old daughter to Amy. Remember the cabin in the woods? The cabin that you set on fire? With the bodies still inside. Remember that? Do you remember this? Tell me! Tell me. Say if you remember. Tell him you remember blowing my partner's brains out! You will only find pain living in the past. Crawford, there's nothing here. Check out. It's him. I know it is. And if it is? But now we have nothing. Let's go man. There will be another day. Right? Now it's waiting. We're smart. We do the right thing. Other day. And on that day, you and I are going to end it. You can count on it. Everyone, out. How did you know the FBI was coming? Experience. You impressed me once more, my friend. As you can see... the FBI declared war on us. Damn it! "I know my horses are safe. - They 're safe. I still have a lot of work for you, my friend. It's best to stay in my house for now. And watch things. Understood. Oh! Victor... this FBI guy, Crawford. He is a problem. He's chasing ghosts. Give me a new one. I said to put a new one! Did I scare you? Where are your mother? Let's play catch catch? Go and find your mother. I have things to do. What is it? Wow, do it again! Dwarf? He's showing me some magic. Why do not you go downstairs and play? But we were joking. I know. But I come down... Pretty soon, okay? Goodbye. I understand you have business here. But I'm telling you to stay away from Anna. The work of my husband and our family are two different things. Do we have a deal? Yes, Ms. Chang. Great. Do not think that I do not know what you're doing. Mr. Chang may think he's the best right now. But it's still me... who is dealing with things here. And I remember that things change. "TRIADS DISTRICT" Do not make me repeat it! He told me. What the hell! Motherfucker! Damn Yakuza! Let's go! Let's teach a lesson in this fucking Japanese. Triads are coming! Wretched triads! Get them! Damn Yakuza! You fucking bastard! I knew we should never have trusted you. Subtle, is not it? It's got Shiro's mark. And now? Get ready for war. Joey Ti, you already were. Park, I want you to stay outside Chang's house in Marin. Daniels, you stay with Yanagawa Motors. Kinler, you take deposit 16. Wick with Goi, keep an eye on Sayu Tea House. I'll take the rookie, shall I? I think I know how to use... a night vision device. Stay tuned, people! This is gonna bust somewhere and we better be ready... to act when we are called. Binoculars, no night vision. The authorities are waiting for us to fight back. If we attack now... we risk everything. What if it was your family? What the fuck is wrong with you? You forgot? It was once my family! Joey was like a son to me. Revenge is a must. But you have to be patient. I will not let anything put our family at risk. I do not want you to do anything. Was I clear? Shiro knows his days are coming to an end. One thing is right... more blood will be shed before it ends. Mr. Shaw... I want you to promise that my wife and daughter will be safe. Nothing bad will happen to them. A man should never give up his honor... or the honor of his family. Keep it. I do not smoke. "SAYU TEA HOUSE" Wow! I did not know your mother was working tonight. Keep your eyes on the target, Goi. Attention. Looks like Takada is having a great party. Shit! Talk to Crawford and ask for reinforcements. We're going now. Crawford. We have problems. Wu just arrived, as you said. I'm on my way. Understood. I'm going in. Cover me. This is for my brother. He is dead! Let's go! Three. What? Three. Shit! Stopped! Shit! FBI! All stopped. Drop your weapons! Hands on the counter, where I can see them. Situation under control. All units back down and fire. Damn it, Goi! I told you to cease fire! We got a sniper, guys. I found it! Do not fucking move! Fuck you! In Japan... you'd already be dead. This is not Japan. Yes? Wu and his men shot Takada's tea house last night. What? The Wu Ti? Are you sure? I tried to stop them. Damn, I told him not to do anything. He leaves me no choice. You did well. My father is very pleased. Now he asks one more thing from you. After I kill Chang, his operation will be destroyed. What else could Shiro want? The head of the wife and the child. Because? That is the order, there is no reason. Never had a problem killing women and children before. But he dares to disobey his master. I have no master. These are my guards. They will assist you in this task as you decide best. What if I refuse? You dropped it. What's going on, John? There are armed men in my front yard. It's just a precaution. A precaution? For what? What have you gotten us into? My God. It's him, is not it? He's coming after us. This will not happen. Sorry, Jen. Not just for this, but for everything. I tried to do the right thing. Give a good life to you and Daniel. Give you what you need. It never had anything to do with what we had or did not have. It was the job. He always came in 1st place, even now, even knowing... that could put us in the same danger that Tom and his family were. You know, I'm not mad at you anymore. Most days I just feel sorry for you. From what you've become. It's Benny. Say hello to Benny for me. What have you got there, Benny? We found the plastic surgeon. Welcome to the house, Dr. Sherman. Hello, boss. What is it? Stop right there. Agent Crawford, right? I do not know anything, really. Doctor, come on, you kidding me? Can you explain to me why one of the brightest surgeons in the world... Are you hiding in the favelas of Mexico? Who are you? A fucking Nazi war criminal? If I were you, I'd be seeing lots of women... in South Beach, taking advantage. Come on. I do not even want to know about the laws you broke. That's not why we're here. I need you to identify this man. You know what happened to the other two doctors, you could be next. We can protect you. You do not know him. Protect me? You can not protect me, you can not stop him. You found me here, he can find me here too. I can stop him. All I need from you, is a "yes" or a "no." This is the Rogue? This is the Rogue? We... we used to be asked... by the US government. And we did surgery on him when he worked for the CIA. We change your face many times. He came to see me three years ago. His face was almost undone. I did what I could. I recovered the muscle, the nervous tissue. I reconstructed the facial bones. And I never saw him again. That's where I made it. Look, Doctor. Let's take it with us. We want to protect you, understand? I want you to get some of your things and we'll leave. Doctor? It's ok? Yes. It's okay if I... Of course, of course. Go. Do you believe in fate, Benny? In destiny? Yes. You know, no matter what you do, your future is already settled. I do not know that. I always found that the future depends on the choices we make. I have prepared everything that is necessary. I'll meet you as soon as I'm done here, okay? Do not worry. Right? I'll be back to walk you to the door. I love you! I was left without my men. My brother is dead. You brought this to yourself. And how did I do that? I gave you my trust. I gave you my loyalty. I sacrifice everything for you and that's how I'm treated? You have the courage to come and talk to me about loyalty. You're a fucking traitor! Shit! He tells me he's loyal... and that is my friend. I trusted him. He was right. He was really loyal, and he was his friend. Base of the AOC, Agent Clark, we have a lot of movement in Chang's mansion. What is going on? Is the boss okay? Mommy loves you, okay? Chang's dead. And the woman and the daughter? Take me to the bodies so I can cut off the heads. No. I killed them. I'm the one who should have that honor. Are you alright? Where is my husband? Where's Clark? On my way. Did he send the photos? Yes sir. What the hell happened there? It seems that Rogue killed Chang and betrayed Shiro's killers. He was wearing them, set them against each other. Why would he do that? John, you will not believe who just got on the plane. Dad, I'm so happy to see you. I'm happy to see you, too. This country seems to be very beautiful. Your English is improving. I have practiced. After all, this is my new home. Rogue insisted on handing the horses in person. It makes me very proud. I gotta ask you for one more thing. Anything. Go back to Japan. But I want to be with you. If I have to oversee our expansion here... I need someone who can insure... our interests in Japan. The only person I can trust... It's in you, Kira. Shiro Yanagawa. Special Agent of the FBI, John Crawford. Back. Welcome to America. Do not unpack. It will not stay for long. Agent Crawford, I'm a busy man. Well, we have a lot to sort out, I think you know that. Three years ago Rogue killed my partner and his family. And you know what? Rogue works for you. Rogue is a myth. Just a rumor. Do you really think? You can not always trust rumors, can you? Rogue betrayed you and broke the killers you sent. You have to wonder why he would do such a thing. I've never seen this man before. Look, I do not care if you kill each other... if they are all dead and buried. That makes my job easier. But if I find evidence to tie some of this shit to you... he will never see Japan again. Not your beautiful little girl. Thanks for the tip, Agent Crawford. Finally. My most loyal unknown. We met in person. I waited a long time for this moment. It is all merit of you that we now have this opportunity. Kira liked to work with you here. One day, she will be a beautiful leader of the Yanagawa clan. Yes one day. This reminds me of Sengoku. When the Daimyo warriors fought each other, to unite Japan... the one who won was a man named Oda Nobinaga. And you know how he did it? He killed everyone who opposed him. Thanks to you, all those who opposed me are dead. I exist just to serve you. In Asia, this could never be sold. But the fortune that will pay here in the West... will be more than enough to continue our expansion in America. And now it's time for your reward. Open the. All future threats should be eliminated. You allowed a threat to remain... by not killing the woman and the child. You disobeyed me. And broke my most sacred code. Your code, not mine. A betrayal can not be forgiven. Take him down there. Convince him to tell us... where the wife and child are. They are truly magnificent. So many deaths for worthless things. False! Find the woman and the child. They will lead us to the real horses. After all these years... Why did you do this? It was you who ordered the murder. I ordered many murders. This was different. You should have left the wife and daughter alone. I did not leave anyone to want revenge. You left one. Your killer, Rogue, has never left alive. So, you're Tom Lone? He changed his face, his voice. All to get to me. Pain can be a weapon if you choose it that way. How do you think... Did we find out you were from the FBI? It was Crawford. "You killed my family." - It was Crawford. He gave you up. Crawford works for me. Because of him, his family is dead. Someone spoke. Someone inside. Near US. You never know who you are working for. Someone spoke. Crawford... Shiro is dead. Get out of this branch while you can, Goi. "BUILD A NEW LIFE" Of America? Skirt! "BUILD A NEW LIFE" Crawford. Do you remember the night we met? I remember my partner ending up with his face. You're only alive today thanks to what he did. I only live today to kill you, you miserable one. Meet me there. Goi! Where are you? Show up! I'm with your surgeon. He identified you. Come on, Crawford. Catch him. It's over, Rogue. Are you listening to me? Why did you do that? What did Shiro promise you was worth... kill me and kill Diane and Amy? No, you're not him! It can not be! It does not even look like him. Look into my eyes, John. The one thing surgeons could never change. Oh, my God, Tom. Is it really you? Yes. Why did not you tell me? It was the only way to get to the responsible man. I never thought it would take me to my best friend. I did not know they would send the Rogue. For God's sake, I thought he was dead. They said they wanted to teach you a lesson... for firing on Rogue. Scaring you a little, that's all. Is that what they told you? Shiro ordered everything. I tried to stop working for him. I tried to go out so many times. I thought I could make that son of a bitch pay for everything that made you... in some way, would make it all right again. Do you think you can forgive me, Tom? Tom Lone is dead. My name is Rogue. No!
