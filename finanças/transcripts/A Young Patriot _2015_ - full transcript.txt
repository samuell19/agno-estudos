Long Live China! Give back Diaoyu Islands! Release our captain! Long Live China! Give back Diaoyu Islands! Release our captain! Come on! Come on! Release our captain! Japanese coastguard collided with Chinese fishing boat near Diaoyu Islands. Our captain is being illegally detained by them. Just watch him and shout slogans when he does. Just watch him and shout slogans when he does. Go on! Keep going! Let's chant the slogan together! Ok! Give us back Diaoyu Islands! Release the captain! Long Live China! Our mother country is growing stronger and stronger. I'm not just mouthing cliches. I see it with my own eyes. I was born in 1990. I see how much stronger China has become ... ...in the last 19 years. When we used to watch TV, the antenna hung from a poplar tree. But now I watch TV ... ... with a remote control, very cozy on my sofa at home. I was born at the time of the Asian Games. But I got to see the Olympic Games at 18. The Olympic Games is a global pageant. We can't have "Coca Cola" out here ... ... at such a patriotic event. It would change the nature of the event. "Coca Cola" has no place here. "Coca Cola" is very foreign. Only Chinese products can show up here. I had a lot of thoughts today. One guy asked me: "How much do they pay you for one day?" I got so mad. I wanted to beat the shit out of him! I particularly admire Chairman Mao. Our founding President! I was born on December 26th, 1990. We share the same day of birth. As if there was some special force connecting us. I love songs from Mao's era... I love songs from Mao's era... like "Nanni Bay" and "My Motherland". And "Nine Nine Sunny Day". Listening to these songs... makes me really happy. Beautiful day the 9th day of the 9th month. A young lad of 18 is sitting by the riverbed. The easterly wind gently propels the windmills... I always look forward to the future. I haven't finished this stage yet... but I like to see what will happen next. I do have a clear major direction. My short-term goal is: to get accepted into university. And if there is an opportunity, I want to join the army. I like photography. I'd like work for the army's publicity department. Or be a photographer. That'd be nice. "For the service of the people" "Patriotism" is not just a slogan. "Patriotism" is not just a slogan. Our country values us. We should show our gratitude by action. What kind of people are achievers? Those who can turn their ideals into real actions. We have to turn our patriotic zeal... and our passion into real actions. Devote ourselves to the construction of the country. My dream of the future is join the army for sure. I'd prefer to go to the border areas. I don't want to stay in safe mainland areas. Only in places like Xinjiang and Tibet... will I be able to realize my full potential. I should go to the harshest places with the army. Our army is like the sun, we are walking on the soil of our motherland. Our nation's glory rests on our shoulders, we are an invincible force! We are the brothers and sons of workers and farmers, we are the military of the people. We are not afraid, we will never yield, We will get rid of all counterrevolutionary elements! Chairman Mao's flag will fly triumphantly high above! This song is so great! I feel so much power, passion and enthusiasm! My brother is the post80s generation, me the post90s. He took part in the grand National Anniversary Military Parade in 2009. But I express my patriotism through ... ... my own actions. I applauded you when you marched with your flag. Really, I was your supporter! Why I did I choose this form of march? I was inspired by the students of the 1919 "May 4th Movement". (Anti-imperialist movement sparking an upsurge of Chinese nationalism) It was started principally by student, joined by workers and businessmen. They organized a huge march of May 4th. It seems there was a student movement in '89 (nota: TianAnMen massacre). But I'm not sure, I don't know much about it. I heard from the adults. It seems that the students were also protesting. I don't know much about the details. It was anticorruption or something like that. Anyway, it was students. Protesting in Tiananmen Square. Then there was a Ker... ...not really a crackdown, they were sent back, I think. But students that year didn't have good prospects. They didn't have nice jobs. Students that year were pretty poor.

Let's just say they weren't good. I evaluated my alternatives. I ruled out going to technical schools. Or a bad university. I decided right away to repeat a year of high school. It's too shameful to have to settle for a technical school! I'm the only one of the 3 boys in my family still in school. When he was in primary school, even high school, I didn't have much time for him. You know, adults are always busy. It's all about money. All about making more money. In high school, I started to notice some change in him. He saved his pocket money, that he got from adults, to buy shirts on the internet. Then he started to march in the streets. I didn't know it at first. Later I saw him in that old military uniform, carrying a flag. I asked him what he was doing, he just said he was joining some activity.

There is no new China without the Chinese Communist Party. The nation ... The nation is the government. How should I put this? I was born at the People's Hospital. As I grew up, everything I needed like food and diapers, milk powder, hospitals, kindergarten, all my education, house, clothes, food, transport, are given by my country. Everyone is part of the big family of our country. We live in the big family of our nation. There are no individuals if there is no country. We didn't have enough money for his school, the family always brought over the money right away. Just to get him in school first. We spent several tens of thousands of yuans, to build our houses. In fact we had to borrow all the money. I asked him, what are you going to do with your life... now that you didn't get into university? You're not very smart or sophisticated. It's impossible for us to find you a job. It's impossible for us to find you a job. You have to count on yourself. My parents and my family... my teachers and even myself, all put huge pressure on me. Many people have high expectations of me. I watch my old classmates get into university, one by one. I'm the only one left behind. In my hotel work, 3 types of people most impress me. The first type: when I open the door, they would say: "hello" before I do. And then I would say "hello". That's the first kind. The second type: When I open the door, I greet them with a "hello". They respond with a "hello". Very polite. The third type: I open the door and say "hello", they don't pay attention to you. These come from mainland China or are local tourists. Here is the internet cable, let me know if you need something. let me know if you need something. The lift! Did we go the wrong way? Where's the lift, little brother? The lift? This way please for the lift. There's a local enterprise... whose Japanese technology investors stayed in this hotel. Japanese people look very civilized. They are simply and neatly dressed. They are amiable, not ostentatious at all. It's simple. There are very few Japanese tourists in China. There are very few Japanese tourists in China. Most of them are on business trips. So they carry lots of luggage. But when we go to help with the luggage, they always decline politely. They wouldn't let us carry their luggage for them. They do it themselves. Japanese people are very independent. When I think of patriotism, I thought of it as the virtue of a person. Now I have a new insight. I think It's our own personal pursuit. I'm accepted by a university this year, I'm so glad! There's been no university student in our family for generations. Now it's even harder. Very few kids get accepted. Who would have thought! When he decided to repeat high school last year, we agreed as long as he wanted to study. So what if we have to spend more money. Even if the family finances have to suffer a bit. Actually, to enable him to go to college, my younger son's working as a cook. Even the younger brother's every penny is saved for for Chantong's education. "May your spirit soar to the skies!" Thank you, all my relatives, for your support. I won't see you very often after I start college. You are our family's 1st college student, so work hard! Work hard and contribute your talents to the society. I will do my best! Take good care of yourself, keep safe. Be careful when you are out there in society. Be careful when you are out there in society. I'm just pretending to be sober. My head's clear, but my feet are not mine. I won't lead a decadent life in university. I will work hard and get good grades. I will work hard and get good grades. It's really not easy getting into university. This way, please. They ask it we can drink some white spirit. I don't want to drink too much white spirit. We shouldn't drink too much white spirit. Self-control! Let's have a good time drinking today! I am kind of drunk already. Drink up! Drink up! Don't say anything more, just drink up! Sichuan people love playing Mahjong. Sichuan people love playing Mahjong. I hate it. I really hate it. I hate Mahjong. I thought getting into university means everything. That it means getting all the so-called honors. You'll no longer be bullied. But now I think it's like I've opened a door, that connects to the outside world. The rest of your life depends on this door. My younger brother is a great worker. He won an "outstanding employee" award. I know that he's doing a great job. I always feel bad that, he dropped out of school at such a young age. I owe him a lot. I'm not good at expressing my feelings. I feel so guilty about my brother. I owe him a lot. Each month he... He's not paid very well, and every penny he earns he gives to the family. Today I've been talking too much from my heart. I shouldn't be so truthful. The whole world is a lie. We are the red guards of Chairman Mao. We come to Beijing's TianAnMen from our countryside. The brilliant red sun rises from the east. Its golden rays shine all over the land. The prairies people love you Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Here comes Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao! "People's Liberation Army" Look, my big backpack. Isn't he cool? Time to get up. Let's imagine. if North Korea had lost during the Korean War, all of Korea would've been under US control. all of Korea would've been under US control. It'd have had a severe impact... and represented a big threat to our capital Beijing. If we hadn't joined in the war, and the whole eastern Korean peninsula... had fallen under US control, if we joined the war after building our production system, we'd have suffered even bigger loss. we'd have suffered even bigger loss. If we joined after our whole financial facilities were developed, our cities developed, our buildings completed, our losses would have been very great. Chairman Mao thought about that, and decided to join the war. His thinking was right. In fact the US is very worried that... we'd be taking the same path again, we'd be taking the same path again, and arm our army and our people with Maoist doctrines. I have no alternative. You really need a computer in college. You really need a computer in college. You need it for homework ... You need it for homework ... or for other activities. I also needed a camera as I'm a Photography major. The two things added up to about 10,000 yuan. This money came from... My dad borrowed 20,000 for different things. My dad borrowed 20,000 for different things. (Did you borrow money yourself too?) Yes, I did. (You did too?) Yes. "The Students' Union (Publicity Department)" Zhao Changtong, can you take photos of these certificates? The ones of this year? Right. Take photos of them ... I'll do it when I'm on duty the day after tomorrow. Better do it tomorrow. We made our posters, did our own PR. We have our own style. My tongue's tied, I can't think of anything to say. I become mute if I have to follow your rhythm. Just shows we've always been rebelling, Give me a B! I have my own way of singing. People say hip-hop comes from the US... People say hip-hop comes from the US... let's show them here in the east... in the orient we have our own voices. Chengdu of the east, CD's own way. Chengdu of the east, CD's own way. Our rap is super cool. We Asians have our own attitude. They have to admit defeat... whether it's Biggs or Tupac! whether it's Biggs or Tupac! They'll see how cool Asian rap is... They'll see how cool Asian rap is... Yeah! How should we do our work? How should we plan activities? How should we go about it? At every meeting with department heads or association presidents, our university's leaders always say : our university's leaders always say : there are two big experiences in university, one is to get involved in the student union, and the other is to fall in love. I had a military training officer who told me, He said I have to join the Party at all costs. To join the army, you have to be a Party member. You have to spend some money or use some relations. But you must join the Party. You have to join the Party even if... You have to join the Party even if... you have to beg some people to do so. Party members are privileged everywhere. Whether it's writing an exam to be a civil servant, or trying to get a job. or trying to get a job. Joining the Party in university is the right thing to do. Only the most representative person can join the Party. It's different at local grassroots levels. Many join the Party for political advantage, Many join the Party for political advantage, (Students' Union Officers) University is still quite an innocent place. Still, some thing are not right. For example, something hateful: some decisions are made internally, without consultation. Jiang Cenpei, come out and help me! Quick, quick! Here, take the rope. You should go to Taotao for this kind of thing. I only realized I needed help after I got here. Get Xiaopang. Where's Xiaopang? How 'bout here? Where are you going? Over here, here. Hold this, let me tie the rope. I can't hold it. It's so big. Hold it just for now. Hold it just for now. Just put it on your shoulders. I'll squat down. Why didn't you call Xiaopang to help? Wow, it's so damp! Anything else? Then let's get them out to take photos. Ok. I'll go get them. You just wanted me come out to help you, right? I'm too busy at the moment. Look, this angle looks good. I'm taking a photo of you taking a photo. Wow, they're cool! History is created by the people. And if the people don't choose you, If you have a system the people don't like, If you have a system the people don't like, If you have a system the people don't like, then the people can overthrow you. then the people can overthrow you. Our system suits our traditional values. Our system suits our traditional values. It's as simple as that. Why didn't we choose capitalism? Why didn't we choose capitalism? Capitalism doesn't suit us. It doesn't correspond to what our culture pursues. You must realize that, though there are the 4 Asian Tigers, the 20th century was the American century. What about the 21st century? What about the 21st century? Some say it'll be China's century. Who put an end to the tragic history of the Chinese people? Who led China to renewed prosperity? Who led China to renewed prosperity? It's the Communist Party of China. Let's see what a neutral observer has to say. Let's see what a neutral observer has to say. What does Li Ao (famous Taiwanese historian) say? "We can safely say that, if we want to stop China from becoming a super power, we just have to implement Occidental democracy in China." What Li Ao means is... all development, whether before WWI or after WWII, the development of the 4 Dragons in the late 20th century, it all comes from a centralized government. On December 9th, 1935 6000 students in Beijing gathered at Xinhuamen, protesting the Nationalist government's noninvolvement policy. It was suppressed by the Nationalist government. About 100 were wounded and 30 arrested. The Dec 9th Students' movement is important in Chinese history. A land beset by war, covered by corpses of the starved. The wind bitterly cold, air filled with wails of despair. China wept in humiliation. But History did not linger. That day, the roaring sound of the Yellow River, accompanied our slogan and our oath, Stand up, my people! Our homeland is full of scars, Our motherland is being burned. A group of youths ignite their blood with passion. I get so emotional when I hear this piece of music. When I hear this music and see everybody, When I hear this music and see everybody, it moves me so much! Do you feel as emotional? Put your hands here. I'm feeling very emotional. 3, 2, 1. Come on, yeah! There's no new China without the Chinese Communist Party. Chongqing Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai met with red songs (propaganda) artists. The artists thank Secretary Bo for developing this platform to promote Socialism. Chongqing Red Songs Committee (promoting Mao era music) is an excellent initiative. I am a Chinese national. I wear my national pride on my chest. (Banner) Build the "5 Chongqing" (Banner) Learn the Party's history... No big change for me since I arrived in Chen The biggest change is having a girlfriend. Her? How should I say? There is a special quality about her. She studies hard. She is probably number 1 in our class. Do you want Ramen? No, the other kind. Both our friends carry a bottle of vinegar with them. You guys from Shanxi love vinegar! But she also does all those things I hate: But she also does all those things I hate: she smokes, she drinks, she plays mahjong. Shit! She does them all! That's the trouble with Sichuan people. My dad's played mahjong from young to old. So much so that he destroyed our family. I shed tears when I found out the truth. You betrayed my love. You are in my debt. You can't pay it back, however much love you offer. You wanted to go, and we parted. Now you want to coax me back with true love. Happy birthday to you. Wish you joy, health, and a bright future. Happy birthday to you. Wish you joy, health, I don't know why. I can't control my feelings. I can't explain it. I just feel that it's really great to be in university. Maybe I'll join the army one day. The army is quite complicated. I don't want to be an officer, nothing special. I just want to be a simple soldier. A pale face with brilliant red lips. Wasn't Marilyn Monroe a white woman? Wasn't Marilyn Monroe a white woman? What color did he give this white person's face? Pink, green, red... So how do you say APPLE in English? I won't tell you, I don't know! I want to ride a boat again this afternoon. Like this? Look, we can see more or less. 1 minute. Good. Go. Idiot, you've pushed the shutter! Push it down and then push it up. Ok, you do it. No. I stand in the middle, between girls. Clean up your face. "Difficult to forget the past..." "Difficult to forget the past..." - Thank you. -You're welcome. I'll call you if there's anything else to film. In China, we often say, when you have money you have power. My mom says it's better to have power, with it comes money. All at once people got all confused. All the central newspapers talked about rectification. It wants to reshape people's thoughts, suppress thinking. (Did you read those newspapers?) I didn't read many. (So how did you know about it?) It was all over the internet. Right from the moment the news broke. It must be a complicated affair. But to put it frankly, he was just caught. During Bo Xilai's time they promoted singing red songs and fighting corruption. Now they say the opposite. Now they say the problem came from the fight against corruption. Bo Xilai is still someone very capable. His father Bo yibo is also from Shanxi province. Before coming to university I thought it'd be... a great training ground, for example, the work with the student union. I still consider it a great training experience. I do feel annoyed by some small things. I do feel annoyed by some small things. This changed my previous opinion. I'm quitting the student union's publicity unit. It seems so far away now when I used to march with that old uniform. I know I've changed. What I was then is different from what I am now. So cool there! So cool there! I especially like Liang Qichao's essay On China's Youths. "If its youths are wise, then the country is wise." "If its youths are strong, the country is strong." "If they're independent, the country is independent." "If they're better than Europeans, the country's better than Europe." "If they're better than the world, the country's better than the world." "The rising sun spreads its rays all around." "The river flows from its source, becomes part of the ocean." "The hidden dragon rises and shows its claws" "The young tiger roars, all creatures tremble." "The hawk tries its wings, prepares to fly." This is the passage I love! Long live Motherland Long live Motherland Long live Motherland Let's leave quickly. This way. Weren't you bored? (He used to be an activist.) Even I find it boring, though it's my 2nd time. (You don't let him go to participate?) No. He didn't want to go himself. (Really?) I kid you not. (I always thought that he was an activist.) Him? He's just a pile of shit. Who says he's an activist? In high school I always hid in the bathroom, with a cigarette in one hand, behind my back. Always watching if a teacher's around, and.. Do you remember when we met that early March? Those moments I will never forget. That's the tune. It provokes a soft tremor in my heart. On a summer day, Yinglian's 18-yr-old lover told her he was joining the army. Time is like a butcher knife. It slices and chops. And then without you knowing, time has gone by. The classmates and friends you grew up withK are all getting married now. Everyone has gone his separate way. I realize that time is like a butcher knife. When I just got into high school, I thought I must come home to Pingyao later, to take care of my parents. But now ... this decision has wavered. this decision has wavered. There is no direct train, you have to transfer. You mean, from Zhaojue to Xichang, and then from Xichang to Xide? Congratulations! Ticket purchased! Volunteer teaching is the only reason... I'm staying around in Chengdu right now. Otherwise I'd already be back home in Shanxi. We've never been to the Ta-Liang mountains. I'm told that education is very backward there. It's so backward that... the children don't go to school if there's no teacher. So there is a big number of "left-behind children". We are going to be volunteer teachers. We want to find one or two among our student... photograph and record them from their point of view. - You should just come this way. - OK. Don't look at us when you're walking. Don't look at us when you're walking. How much is a dozen of this notebook? RMB 200. And this too. Give it to us as a present? Your student card is only valid for home journeys. Isn't it valid for the whole country? Who said so? It's only from home to school and vice versa. You stupid woman! Can't you just shut up, you're such a nuisance! We can't take the tickets. I told him it wouldn't work with the student card! He didn't listen! Is there anything else we should take with us? Let's take the umbrella. (Please line up to get on the train.) I represent the Yi ethnic group... to welcome our volunteer teacher friends. Thank you. You may change the life of a kid in 15 days. It's a very important thing. Another problem. It's drugs and AIDS. It's drugs and AIDS. If you have any information, how to prevent AIDS, please teach them. how to prevent AIDS, please teach them. How AIDS infects others, and the danger of drugs. What do you think we should teach? We're only there for 15 days. Some courses need long-term teachers, like Maths and Chinese. We can't make a huge difference in just 15 days. We need to make some adjustments. They're just mountain kids. What we can give them, firstly, is the desire to get out of their isolated mountain, and to seek knowledge. And secondly to improve their self-confidence. "Zhaojue to Xichang" For 10? What're you doing here? We are going to teach at the school. I see. 10 people? It's gonna be a little tight. Can you take us directly to that place? Can you take us directly to that place? Ay, slow down. Close the door first. The school is a little bit far from here. A little bit far. I'm upset because we'll have to make 2 trips up. We'll take you there. We have more people to help. The problem is it's very heavy. Just go, it doesn't matter. It's not so realistic to do 2 trips, It'll get dark. We can carry another bag. Should we take more bags? It takes hours just for 1 trip. Is this bridge safe? It's unshakable. Don't shake it. Is it unshakable, Ok? I dare not walk. You should run, don't you know? Don't be afraid. Just slow down. Thank you so much, Miss Xu. Hey there's a cow by itself. It runs so fast. I can carry it myself. I can carry it myself. I'll carry it up for you. I must rest a bit, comrades, I'm too tired. (Yi dialect) He said you must be tired walking uphill. (Yi dialect) He said thank you. Put it down first. Where are we sleeping? Right here? There, that small black hut. And where's the stove? How do we cook? We can make one ourselves. Where is the toilet? Right, Miss, where are we sleeping tonight? We usually sleep up there. It's ok up there. Won't it break with all of us sleeping on top? No. We do it all the time. Hey brother, did you fall asleep? No, we are making the beds. We are not sleeping. If someone asked me, what this place was. I would proudly tell him, 'this is my homeland'. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, raised us and guided us. (Yi tribe song) Thank you for working so hard. No problem. Zhao Changtong, we will have to teach tomorrow. This wine you made is so tasty. What's this called? Ba Ba It's so delicious. It's such a great pleasure to come to a village of the Yi tribe. The Yizi village on Kuyi River. We are so happy to come to teach. And be able to share a meal of your ethnic cuisine together. And have this conversation with you. And to introduce us to your wine. It's such a beautiful experience in our life. It's priceless. It's a gift of friendship. It's more than just a meal. It's our sentiment for each other. We Yi people don't mind this. We Yi people don't mind this. I love you all so much! Should we let them in now? I have to go check. Class will start this afternoon. Come back then. It'll take them 2 hours to get home. Then sit home for 2 hours and come back. Do you need any help? Not today. Just tell us if you need anything. Is 200 RMB enough? 200 RMB? Buy enough food for 200. Take more money, you should buy more. 200 may not be enough. You can't buy food for 15 days, they'll go bad. Just enough for a few days. For 200? "(hello, teacher)" Is it far? It's far! Make a wheelbarrow! Be quiet, everybody. Second grade students sit here. First grade students sit here. (in Yi dialect) Second grade students, raise your hand. Let me count the 2nd grade students. Keep your hands up. How many 2nd grade students? Be quiet, be quiet, don't talk! (Village chief in Yi dialect) Kids, don't make noise! Or else we'll tell your parents. These teachers come from Chengdu University to teach you. They'll teach you for 15 days. We're going to take notes, on who is absent in those 15 days. After we note down your names, for each day you're absent. you'll be fined 20 yuans. You can't skip class either for a picnic or something! He'll be the first grade class captain. He'll be captain of both classes. You must obey him. We should give other kids a chance. Ok, he'll be captain for 2nd graders then. The girl over there, do you understand Mandarin? Can you two understand (Mandarin)? Do you understand what I'm saying? You are a second grader, aren't you? We are very happy to be here, to teach you for 15 days. (Yi dialect translation) We hope you will cooperate with us actively. We are here today, not just as your teachers, but also as your friends, your brothers and sisters. Little friend, please stand up and say loudly, in Mandarin. I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese, I'm from Sichuan. I'm from Sichuan. Can you ask if everyone understood? (Yi dialect translation) I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese, Chinese... Changtong, I saw that book. What? I saw that book. You should bring it over. It's in the classroom on the desktop of the first row. - Or the second row. - OK. (Talking about the Japanese coastguard incident) Even the people are blase. Why should we care when our government doesn't? It's all lame bullshit. Even North Korea dares to hold our captain hostage. Fucking North Korea. They even beat up our captain! Think about how Japan was just after the war. It almost became a colony, and it woke up. Didn't America almost take over Japan? Japanese government immediately put great resources on education. But look at us in China. Most of the money is squandered by the government officers. Who are those in the executive positions? Do they really represent the people? "People's democratic autocracy" I really don't get what people's democratic autocracy means. Actually, in the political textbooks, it means the Deputies in the People's Congress. And whom do they represent? How many of them are farmers? You can find out from the list. They're all fucking CEOs or executives of some big companies. We've been brain-washed all this time. If we say it bluntly. it's brainwashing. If we say it nicely it's called Raising political awareness. Isn't that right? We must be loyal to our country and to our Party. They are delivering the firewood. Come inside. There's so much wood just taking 1 piece from each kid. Do they bring one every day? I think it's no longer necessary. We can't use them all. Don't push, stop! Two by two. You go first. One boy and one girl at a time. Everyone should be quiet during registration. I think this boy can keep the class under control. You mean he can communicate with the class. Yes, communication. Tell them to be quiet, now! Quiet! Quiet! Stop talking! Tell them to sit down during the lesson. Don't put your legs up on the table in class. Teacher would get very angry! We have to make sure that she can come every day. - It's sure. - What's going on?

No class this afternoon? - no school this afternoon? - No. - You went fishing? - Fishing. Why didn't you come to school this afternoon? That's big enough. OK, please wrap it up for me. Could you make it a little cheaper? No bargaining here. Don't talk! Be quiet! Be quiet! (National Anthem. Rise up! You who don't want to be slaves...) Slave ... Slave ... Slave. Look here. This word is 'slave'. Repeat after me, slave... Slave ... Slave ... Slave ... OK. What does 'slave' mean? 'Slave' is someone without personal freedom. He is not his own man. You understand? He has to obey his master. He has no personal freedom. Yi ethnic nation, the Mongolians, Zhuang ethnic nation, the Hans. The Uighurs. What else? Bai ethnic nation. What else? Miao ethnic nation. All these ethnic nations combine to become the Chinese Nation. The Chinese Nation. We used to be oppressed, but now we've risen. We have our own flag. We just want to put up a flagpole over there. That tall or taller. Arise...Arise. You who refuse to be slaves. With our flesh and blood... build up our new Great Wall. (Kuyi Village Grade One students) The Chinese Nation is at its most perilous time. Indignation fills the hearts of our countrymen. Arise, arise, arise. The Chinese Nation is at its most perilous time. Arise! Arise! Arise! Many hearts with one mind, marching on under the fire of the enemy. March on. March on and on. Hello, Teacher ZHAO.

I love Grandpa Mao. Yeah! If there is any demolition against our will, all this can be used as evidence In a court of law. Check it out! It costs 100RMB. It takes a TF card. (Was this land allocated or did you just occupy it?) Allocated. It was allocated legally. Not the one being dug over there. (You just occupied it?) Yes. Why did the government grant us this land in the first place? There was something fishy even during the allocation process. You see the corrupted village leaders, they occupy several properties. They buy other houses in advance, They buy other houses in advance, so that they can make profit from demolition compensation. (Why is your mother building this house?) (Why is your mother building this house?) Apart from the question of demolition (and compensation), we have the feeling of owning our home. That means a lot. There's a feeling of belonging. It looks very good, it makes us feel happy. This is a sitting room. One sitting room and three bedrooms. Another small room over here. This is normally the toilet. This is normally the toilet. It takes 2 years to build this house. It took us two years. It takes only 40 minutes to tear it down. I once personally saw the demolition of a house, the owners just stood there looking numbly. My mom asked if he was savoring it. It's exactly the indifferent onlooker described by (writer) LU Xun. Just numb. (Yesterday grandma said you are 90 years old.) She is 88. (She says you are 90.) I'm also 88. My grandpa used to be a railroad worker. He retired in the 80s. He is a huge fan of Jin Opera. Look at his photo in stage costume. His award In the Pingyao Jin Opera Amateur Contest. Ok, come, get up! A little effort! Come! Ok, let's sit up... Hold on to me. Good. Here, give me the hand. About the demolition (of my grandparents' house), it'll happen , it's for sure. All you can do is to hold out for more compensation. It's just being realistic. We have no idea about relocation. Where will the other thousand inhabitants live? Does anyone know? Hold this, hold this. First we have to know where they will relocate our parents. Let's see what they're going to suggest. Let's see what they're going to suggest. Otherwise our parents will stay here. We'll see when they pass away. Grandma, brother hit his head! Bang! Where? Here? He just jumped up and hit the top. Oh it's 'Taming of the Princess'.(Jin Opera) Let grandma see? 'Taming of the Princess'. Yes I know. It's ok. It's red. Beijing's Golden Mountain shines with brilliance. Chairman Mao is that golden sun. Its warmth and kindness light up this heart of a slave. I have a bad feeling. Are they coming after us? Hey, seems that way. Come back, Hao hao! Get down from there! Let's go! Get down from there! Get down from there! Whose bike is this? Bike. Get down quick! What's it with you guys? You want your bike? What are you shouting about? Are you coming down? You just shout to scare people. What are you doing? We're shouting about demolition! Wait a minute. Down! Down! Down! So come do your demolition! All of you, come down. All of you. Let's stand over there. Don't think about them. You're killing people! Anybody there? Told you guys to find a safe shelter. There was nobody. It's ok. It'll be ok soon. It's over. Then they tore our house down. It was a deadlock with the government. We couldn't win. The village chief was threatening them, that if they didn't sign the agreement right away, they'd tear the new house down too (without compensation). My uncle thought there was no point to drag on ... about my grandparents' house. So they signed the agreement. The compensation he signed for, is identical to the first one they proposed. Our resistance efforts amounted to nothing. Our resistance efforts amounted to nothing. People grow up. What we say at each stage, People grow up. What we say at each stage, reflects our reaction to that epoch. reflects our reaction to that epoch. As we grow up, our thinking becomes more complex. We had little contact with the outside world, during high school. We had simple ideas about our country. We had simple ideas about our country. What are you trying to do with my beard? These kids have so much energy. These kids have so much energy. It was hard to photograph them. Can this be bigger? We love peace, we love our hometown. We will destroy anyone who dares to invade it. Each specific epoch has its own patriotic expression. You cannot define real patriotism. Real patriotism... is very broad. I don't know if you know what I mean. Hello, village leader. Can you hear me? Is that villager leader Leershuge? I'm sending you something from the post office. You'll receive them in two days. You'll receive them in two days. Please distribute them to the villagers, and the children. I wanted to join the army since high school. The desire was just so strong then. I was always talking about it. I was always talking about it. But it's now fading. I don't think so much about it anymore. Though we keep developing throughout life. I'd like to improve things quickly... financially or life in general, improve things quickly in the short term. To work harder for it. Be more stable. It all seems so complicated. Superman... Cynique... Corruption... Evil... The right to vote. How many people use it right? We can't really vote in China. We can't really vote in China. We are different from other countries. The right of supervision, for example. The right of supervision, for example. What do we supervise, corrupt officials? How would anyone find the time to prosecute a corrupt official, when he can't even assure his own daily necessities. Never mind prosecuting others. Our awareness is in one system. Our awareness is in one system. but our actions are in another. but our actions are in another. We can't put the things we have to do ... We can't put the things we have to do ... into an idealized system, it's impossible. Chantong is becoming the "Angry Young Man". The government is now talking about prosecution. Against greed and corruption. President Hu Jintao talked about Party plans at the 18th Congress. To build a better Party. Otherwise,' said he, "there is danger of demise of Party and Country". It's the most serious warning he's ever voiced. It's the most serious warning he's ever voiced. The Communist Party couldn't let itself be ruined by this generation! Is it going to be ruined only after 60 years? China seems prosperous and strong. China seems prosperous and strong. GDP is top 2 in the world. But what is this prosperity built on? Japan's GDP is built on high efficiency, high development. Ours is built on high consumption, high pollution etc., What are you laughing at? You ride the bike and I'll carry it. Father, Weiwei is home to see you. He can hear you, but he can't talk. Father! Did you see his eyes move? Do you see Weiwei? There's nothing we can do. - Did you see it? - hum... He knows everything but just can't talk. I want to keep more photos of my grandpa now at the end. The demolition made my grandpa's health deteriorate. Although we can't blame everything on the demolition, it's still related. If you lived in one place all your life, you get used to it. The change was sudden.
