(upbeat orchestral music) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Please. Mr. Dodgson, just once more. - Yes, please tell us that story again. - Yes, do! - That's all till next time. - Ah, but it is next time. - That's enough till we've landed and had our tea. Peer over there, please, Miss Alice. There's our picnic spot. - Oh, lovely. - Yes. - Come on, Duckworth. - Look at all those daisies! - They're lovely. - Yes. Oh, look at it. - I remember so well that golden afternoon when I first told the story of Alice's adventures underground. It was a beautiful midsummer day in early July. My friend, Duckworth and I had, as usual, taken the three little sisters, Larina, Alice, and Edith, out on a river picnic. (birds chirping) Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do, so she was considering, in her own mind, as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisy. (suspenseful music) When suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. (cards clattering) (suspenseful music) (Queen grunting) (soft orchestral music) - How strange. (light orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Alice chuckling) - Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I shall be too late. - Goodness, this is quite extraordinary. Why is everything so enormous? What can have happened? It's such a large rabbit hole, I'll just take a look inside. (intriguing orchestral music) (Alice gasps) Goodness, I'm falling. What's going to happen to me now? And where shall I fall to, I wonder? Perhaps I shall fall right through the Earth. (chuckling) How funny it'll seem to come out among the people with their heads downwards. The Antipathies, I think. But, I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is. Please ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia? No, no, I mustn't ask. Perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. Oh, this looks interesting. Maybe something on here will tell me. No, only tea things and marmalade. (sighs) I wish my cat, Dinah, was down here with me. Dinah, my dear, there are no mice in the air, I'm afraid. But you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse. But do cats eats bats, I wonder? (Alice exclaims) (suspenseful orchestral music) Goodness. (light orchestral music) - Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting! (footsteps pattering) (uplifting orchestral music) - Which way? (door knob clicking) (key clicking) (Alice gasps) (enchanting orchestral music) (Alice gasping) Oh, what a beautiful garden. But how do I get out there? Oh, even if my head did go through, it would be of little use without my shoulders. (gentle orchestral music) (lock clicking) Where did that come from? It certainly wasn't here before. (gasping) No, I'll look first to see whether it's marked poison or not. (gentle orchestral music) (Alice sniffs) (gasping) What's happening to me? (intense orchestral music) I must be shutting up like a telescope. Oh no. The key! I've forgotten the key! (Alice grunting) Come, there's no using crying like that. I advise you to leave off this minute. Well, I'll eat it. And if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key. If it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way, I'll get into the garden. And I don't care which happens. Which way? (suspenseful orchestral music) Which way? (Alice grunts) My head. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Great girl like you to go on crying in this way. Stop this moment, I tell you. (crying) (tears splattering) - The Duchess is waiting, I mustn't be late. She will be mad if she has to wait. I'll zoom like a rocket as fast as I can, now that I have my gloves and my fan. - If you please, sir. - What? (soft orchestral music) - He's left his fan and gloves behind. Everything is queer today.

Things are worse than ever now. (Alice exclaims) (water splashing) (gentle orchestral music) Oh, I wish I hadn't cried so much. I should be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears. - [Mouse] Tentative pool is that important. - That will be a queer thing, however, everything is queer today. Oh, mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I'm getting very tired of swimming about here. - Oh, tentative pool is that important. (laughing) - Perhaps it doesn't quite understand English. It must be a French mouse. (speaking foreign language) (Mouse exclaiming) Oh, I beg your pardon. I'd quite forgot you don't like cats. - Not like cats? Would you like cats if you were me? - Well, perhaps not. Are you fond of dogs? - Please, don't talk to me about cats or dogs. Young lady, you seem to have an unfortunate habit of saying and doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Take this, for instance. You've cried so much, you've made a big pool of tears, and now, I'm most uncomfortable and very wet. Well, really. That's no way to carry on. Tears are very precious and not to be spread about. You silly girl. You know you can't go through life forever crying. - You're right, of course. Oh, dear. I do wish I hadn't cried at all. - You should do things in moderation. Now, let us get to the shore, out of all this, and I'll tell you why. - All right. (voices muttering) - Oh. Goodness, where did they come from? - To the shore. Come on. This is the way. (all muttering) (laughs) Come on. Come on. Gather round, everyone, and listen to me. I'm going to show you all how to get dry.

(all speaking at once) (light orchestral music) - You promised to tell me why it is you hate cats and dogs. - Mine is a long and sad tale. - It is a long tail, certainly, but why do you call it sad? - Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house, "Let us both go to law. I will prosecute you. Come, I'll take no denial. We must have a trial, for really, this morning, I've nothing to do." (laughs) Said the mouse to, you are not attending. What are you thinking of? - I beg your pardon. You'd got to the fifth bend, I think. There. - I had not. - A knot? Oh, do let me help to undo it. - Hmm. I shall do nothing of the sort. You insult me by talking such nonsense. - Oh, I didn't mean it. You're so easily offended. Please come back and finish your poem. (all speaking at once) What a pity it wouldn't stay. I wish I had our Dinah here. She'd soon fetch it back. - Who's Dinah? - Dinah's our cat. (all gasp) She's such a capital one for catching mice. (all gasp) I wish you could see her after the birds. Why, she's- (all speaking at once) I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah. Nobody seems to like her down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world. - Oh, the duchess. The duchess. Oh, my dear paws. Oh, my fur and whiskers. She will have me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets. Where can I have brought them, I wonder? - He's looking for his gloves and fan. I remember seeing them when I was in that great hall with the table and the little door into the garden, though where they've all vanished to I simply don't know. - Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?

This must be the white rabbit's house. I'll just go in and see. Yes, it is. "W. Rabbit." Hmm. It's rather unusual for a rabbit to live in a house. How queer it seems to be running messages for a rabbit. Yes, here they are. I know something interesting is sure to happen whenever I eat or drink anything, so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me large again. I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing. But really, there isn't much room to grow anymore in here. Oh. (suspenseful orchestral music) Goodness, that's quite enough. I hope I shan't grow anymore. As it is, I can't get out of the door, so I can do no more whatever happens. - Mary Ann. Mary Ann. Fetch me my gloves this instant. (knocking at door) (both grunting) Then I'll go round and get in at the window. - That you won't. (gasping) (glass shattering) - Pat! Pat!

What is that in the window? - Sure it is an arm, your honor. - An arm, you goose? Whoever saw an arm as big as that? Why, it fills the whole window. - Sure it does, your honor, but it's an arm for all that. - Well, it has no business in there. Go and take it away. - Sure I don't like it, your honor, at all, at all. - Do as I tell you, you coward. - Look out, your honor. Oh, your honor. You've gone and done it again. You've destroyed me cucumbers. Oh, dear, dear. Ah! - I wonder what they'll do next. - [Pat] Pull yourself together. We've got to have a plan of action. - They're up to something. - Where's the ladder? Bill, Mick, come here. - Oh. - Come here. - Fetch it here, lad. That's the spirit. - Look at this arm. - Put it up against this corner then. - No, tie it up first. Tie it up. - All right, all right. - Go on then. (light orchestral music) (sniffs) - Will the roof hold him, your honor? - Mind that loose slate. - Here it comes. Heads below! - Ow. Who did that? - It was was bill up on the roof, I fancy, your honor. - Bill, you must go down the chimney. - Nay, I shan't. You do it, Mick. - Oh, that I won't. You will. - Bill must go down. - Oh, no. - Down the chimney. - Bill, the master says you have to go down the chimney. - [Rabbit] Bill must do it. - Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he? Well, we'll see. - I don't think you can let Bill go down- - [Alice] I think I can kick a little. This is Bill.

Oh, thanks. I'm better now. But I'm a deal too flustered to tell. All I know is everything's as nice as pie. Suddenly, I'm in the sky. It's nice to be back here on land. But what's me tail doing in me hand? - Oh, never mind the old fella. - Oh. - We'll have to burn the house down. - If you do, I'll set Dinah on you. - Pat, a barrel full of pebbles will do to begin with. - Barrel full of what? (all muttering) - [Rabbit] Wa-hoo! Right in the nose. - Oh, I'll put a stop to this. - There she is. (all muttering) See? See what I did? She's scared to come out. That one must have hit her. It must have hit her. You are not in charge here. I'm in charge. This is my house. It's my room. - If I eat one, it's sure to make some change in my size. As it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose. (mysterious orchestral music) (Alice whimpering) (Alice sighing) I know what I'm doing. There's no need to tell me anything. We have my plan. (Alice sighing) - Oh, thank goodness. (all muttering) (light orchestral music) - There she goes. Come on. Come on and get her, Guinea pigs. - [Pat] Which way did she go, sir? (all yelling at once) (grumbling) - Oh. Oh. (light orchestral music) Oh. - Now the next thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. Yes, I think that'll be the best plan. In the meantime, I think I'll try and sing "How Doth the Little Busy Bee", if I can remember the words.

Explain yourself. - I can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself, you see? - I don't see. - I can't put it more clearly, for I can't understand it myself. And be so many sizes in a day is very confusing. - It isn't. - Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet, but when you have to turn into a chrysalis, you will someday, you know? And then after that, into a butterfly. I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you? - Not a bit. - It would feel very queer to me. (laughs) - Who are you? - I think you ought to tell me who you are first. - Why? (light orchestral music) Come back. I've something important to say. Keep your temper. - Is that all? - No. So you think you are changed, do you? - (sighs) I'm afraid I am, sir. I can't remember things as I used to. - What kind of things? - Well, I've tried to sing "How Doth the Little Busy Bee", but it all came out different. - It was wrong from beginning to end. What size do you want to be? - Well, I'd like to be a little larger, sir, if you don't mind. Three inches is such a retched height to be. - It's a very good height indeed. - But I'm not used to it. - You'll get used to it in time. One side will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter. - One side of what? (yawning) The other side of what? - Of the mushroom. (mysterious orchestral music) - How strange. I wonder where it could have gone. Now, which is which? (mushroom tearing) (light orchestral music) Now, really, the next thing I've got to do is to get into that beautiful garden. But how is that to be done? I wonder.

Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing nohow. - Contrariwise, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak. - I'm sure I'm very sorry. - I know what you're thinking, but it isn't so nohow. - Contrariwise, if it was so- - It might be. - But as it isn't- - [Both] It ain't. - I was thinking, "which is the best way out of this wood?" It's getting so dark. Would you tell me, please? First boy. - Nohow. - Next boy. - Contrariwise. - You've begun wrong. The first thing in a visit is to say- - [Both] "How do you do?" And shake hands. (lush orchestral music) - Oh, I hope you're not much tired. - [Both] Nohow. So much obliged. - Now would you please tell me which way leads out of the wood? For, really, it's coming on very dark.

We've no objection. - [Both] Contrariwise. - Selfish things. - Do you see that? (gasps) - It's only a rattle. It's old and broken. - It's spoiled, of course. - You needn't be so angry about it. - But it's new, I tell you. I bought it yesterday. My nice new rattle! Of course you agree to have a battle. - I suppose so. (both grunting) Only, she must help us to dress up, you know. - Do I look pale underneath my helmet? - Well, yes, a little. - I'm very brave generally, only, today, I happen to have a headache. (Alice laughs) - And I've got a toothache. I'm far worse than you. - Well, then you'd better not fight today. - Oh, we must have a bit of a battle. What's the time now? - Half past four. - Let's fight till six and then have dinner. - And all about a rattle. - I wouldn't have minded so much if it hadn't been a new one.

Secondly, because they're making so much noise inside, no one could possibly hear you. - Well, please, then, how am I to get in? - I shall sit here until tomorrow.

I heard every word you fellows were singing. - Tell us a story. - Yes, please do. - Yes, and be quick about it, or you'll be asleep again before it's done. - Well, once upon a time, there were three little sisters, and they lived at the bottom of a well. - But what did they live on? - They lived on- - Psst. Treacle. - What? - Treacle. Treacle. - Oh, yeah. They lived on treacle. - Ah, but they couldn't have done that, you know. They'd have been ill. - So they were, very ill. - [Alice] Oh. But why did they live at the bottom of a well? (stammering) - It was a treacle well. Treacle, treacle well. - Treacle well? Oh, it was a treacle well. - There's no such thing. (all shushing) - Look, if you can't be still, well, you better finish the story for yourself. - No, please go on. I won't interrupt you again. - I want a clean cup. Let's move one place on. (grand orchestral music) - But I still don't understand your story of the three little sisters. Did they really draw treacle out of a well? - You can draw water out of a water well, so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well, eh, stupid? - But they were in the well. - Of course they were. Well in. Yeah, and, you know how you say things are much of a muchness? Well, did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness? - Well, really, now that you ask me, I don't think I- - Then you shouldn't talk! (both muttering) (light orchestral music) (grunting) - In you go. - [Both] In you go. (light orchestral music) - Well, at any rate, I shall never go there again. Stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life. (laughs) I wonder where this leads to. Now I'll manage better this time. I'll eat a piece of mushroom, and that should make me grow smaller. (light orchestral music) (all muttering) - Look out, five. - I couldn't help it. Seven jogged my elbow. - Yeah, that's right, five. Always laying the blame on others. - You'd better not talk. I heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded. - What for? - That's none of your business, two. - Yes, it is his business, and I'll tell him. It was for giving the cook tulip roots instead of onions. (laughs) - Well, of all the unjust things. - Would you tell me, please, why you're painting those roses? - Well, the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to have been a red rose tree, you see, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the queen was to find out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know? So we was trying, before the queen comes, just to make this- (brass fanfare music) - The queen! The queen! (stately orchestral music) (grand orchestral music) - Who is this? (hiccups) Idiot. What's your name, child? - My name is Alice, so please your majesty. Why, they're only a pack of cards after all. I needn't be afraid of them. - And who are these? - How should I know?

Do you play croquet? - Oh, yes. - Come on then. (Rabbit mumbling) - Rather nice day, isn't it? - Yes, very. Ooh, where's the duchess? (shushing) The duchess is under sentence of execution. - What for? - She boxed the queen's ears. (Alice laughs) Hush, hush. The queen will hear you. You see, she arrived rather late, and the queen said- - Take your places. - Ooh. (light orchestral music) - Off with his head. (card moans) Off with his head. Off with his head. - Come. - Off with his head. Off with- - They're certainly fond of beheading people here. The great wonder is that there's anyone left alive. - Shush. Come on, come on, come on. (laughs) - Oh, this is an impossible game. - Hello there. Here I am. Over here. - It's the Cheshire cat. - How are you getting on? - There's no use in speaking to it till its ears have come, or at least one of them. - Did you enjoy the croquet game? - Well, they certainly don't play croquet the way I remember it played. - How do you like the queen? - Not at all. It's so extremely unlikely to win that it's hardly worthwhile finishing the game. - Who are you talking to? - It's a friend of mine, a Cheshire cat. Allow me to introduce him. - I don't like the look of it at all. However, he may kiss my hand if he likes. - I'd rather not. - Don't be impertinent, and don't look at me like that. - A cat may look at a king. - Well, it must be removed. Oh, my dear, would you see that that cat is removed? ♪ Off with his head ♪ ♪ Off with his head ♪ ♪ Mutilate it ♪ ♪ Decapitate it ♪ ♪ And there'll be one less mouth to be fed ♪ - Executioner. - Off with his head. - I can't cut its head off unless there's a body to cut if off from. - Nonsense. Anything that's got a head can be beheaded, so stop talking nonsense. - If it's not done immediately, everybody's head will be off. - But it belongs to the duchess. You'd better ask her about it. - She's in prison. Fetch her here. - Fetch her, fetch her, fetch her. Come on, come on, come on. (whimpering) Psst. - You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing. - When I'm a duchess, I won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without it. Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered. - You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit. - Perhaps it hasn't one. - Tut, tut, child. Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it. - Uh, it's gone. It can't have disappeared. - It was here a moment ago, sire. - Is his head off? - Well, its head's gone, if it'd please your majesty. - Good. - What are you doing here? - A fine day, your majesty. - Now I give you fair warning. Either you or your head must be off, and that's in about half no time. Take your choice. Have you seen the mock turtle? - I don't even know what a mock turtle is. - It's a thing mock turtle soup is made from. - I never saw one or heard of one. - Come on then, and he shall tell you his history. (yawning) Up, lazy thing, and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history. - What, what, what? - I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered. - (laughs) What fun. - What's the fun? - Why, she. It's all her fancy, you know. They never execute nobody. Come on. (mumbling melodically) (Alice panting) - Everybody says "come on" around here. I never was so ordered about in all my life. Never. (sobbing) - What's his sorrow? - It's just his fancy, that. He hasn't got no sorrow, you know. This here young lady wants for to know your history, she do. - I'll tell her, but don't say a word till I'm finished. - Oh. (stammering) - (sighs) I don't see how he can ever finish if he doesn't begin. (sobbing) - Once I was a real turtle. - Ah, yes. Yes. - When we were little, we went to school in the sea. The master was an old turtle. We used to call him "tortoise." - Why did you call him "tortoise" if he wasn't one? - We called him "tortoise" because he taught us. Really, you are very dull. - You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such stupid questions. Carry on, old fellow. But don't take all day about it. - Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you may not believe it. - I never said I didn't. - You did. - Hold your tongue. - We had the best of educations. We went to school every day. - I've been to a day school too, you know. You needn't be so proud as all that. - With extras? - Yes, we learned French and music. - And washing? - Certainly not. - Ah. (laughs) Yours wasn't a really good school. (indistinct) - At ours, they always had at the end of the bill French, music, and washing, extra. - You couldn't have wanted it much living at the bottom of the sea. (muttering) (sobbing) - I couldn't afford to learn it. (sobbing) I only took the regular course. - What was that? - Well, reeling and writhing to begin with, of course. And then the different branches of arithmetic, ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision. Then there was mystery, mystery ancient and modern. Seaography. - Ah, that's enough of lessons. Tell us something about games now. (stammering) (wailing) Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, it's as though he's got a bone in his throat. (muttering) Oh, dear. Carry on. - You may not have lived under the sea. - I haven't. - And perhaps you have never been introduced to a lobster. - I once tasted- - What? - No, never. - Then you have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is. - No, indeed. What sort of dance is it? - Well, first you form into a line along the seashore. - Two lines! (all chattering) - Those seals, salmons, turtles and so on. And then when you cleared all the jellyfish out of the way- - That generally takes time. - You advance twice- - Each with a lobster as a partner. - Of course. Advance twice. Set to partners. - Change partners. Retire in same order. - Then, you know, you throw the lobsters out to sea as far as you can. - Swim after them. - Turn a somersault in the sea. - Ahoy, Matey. Change lobsters again. Yippee. - Back to land again. (light orchestral music) - Step up. Step down. Right, left, right, kick. One, two, next point. Yee-hoo. Hurry, hurry, hurry. (all mumbling melodically) (upbeat orchestral music) (sighing) - Oops. (laughs) That was a very pretty dance. - Do you want to see some more of it? - Oh, very much indeed. - Come on then.

Yes, yes, of course I did. Yes. (all muttering) Oh, silence. Silence!
