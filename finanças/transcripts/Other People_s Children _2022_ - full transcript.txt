Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE @KG - This is not like in the book! - Because it's an adaptation. - Madam, tell us how it ends! - Badly, obviously! You know this since you've all read the novel, right? You can all go without noise please! But madam, I didn't understand anything! Who's taking the bus? Bye Madam. - How are you, sweetheart? - Speed! - Here, take this. - Ah, the keys. - I left the remote in class 128, and the video projector is on... - Alright, noted. - All good? Can I leave this, please? - Yes, no problem! - Thanks. - Oh please! - Ciao. - Ciao. Wait, wait! - What? No way... - I'm not well at all... - What's wrong with you? I don't know. - Cool! - Yes, very cool. - So, let's see... Regarding internships, we are always faced with the same problem: Companies benefit from tax exemptions, and don't want to take in our youngsters, So I wanted to know where we are on that matter. What are we doing? Students don't know how to write a motivation letter. They're not to blame, we never taught them, but something needs to be done. That's a great idea, I'm thinking French, Rachel? Yes. I had thought of that too. It's something we already mentioned. That in the autobiographical curriculum... sorry, on the autobiographical narrative, and on the self-narrative, we could do preparations for motivational letters. - That would be great. - Perfect. We're going to talk about "VienVoirMonTaf" association, so... - Oh shit, Paul... - Bye, Rachel. - Yeah, bye! - Damn, did you forget? - No! - Not at all, no! - No? You didn't forget? - I'm sorry. - You really piss me off. I have guitar lessons, I couldn't have said Tuesday. Are you sure I said Tuesday? Fuck it, I'm not your driver. I'll drop you off at the first metro. What time is your lesson? What is this watch? You wear watches now? - It's a gift. - A gift? It's a present from my father. Don't start. If I tell you it's from a girl, you're gonna laugh. You really piss me off. I don't have to feel guilty. - I said nothing. - I know you. We haven't been together for eight years. Eight years and I'm still justifying myself. I'm sick. You have a message. Who's "Ali Guitar"? Ouch! Careful, shit. Bye! - Bye, Ali. - Bye. - See you, boss. - Bye, Ali. Yes? - No, no, nothing. - Ah. Go ahead, please. Excuse me. - Where are you going? - Eh? -Where are you going? Where I'm going? Wherever you're going... - And you? - Uh... It's crazy because that's exactly where I'm going. - No way! - Yup. That's amazing! Let's go together. Wanna go for a drink? Yeah. Red coke, with a Lungo. No, not red, sorry. A diet zero rather. No, uh, uh... No, not a diet coke... - Are you always like this? - No. Here, for example, I'm just a little nervous. - What do you want? - Excuse me, sir. I'll take a diet coke, with a Lungo, at the same time. - A coke and a coffee? - Yes. - At the same time. - Okay. Yes, I've decided to ruin my teeth tonight. Here. Come. I'm just dropping you a coffee. - Are you gonna rinse your eyes? - No, I think you're handsome. No, I don't see you, where are you? Huh? Are you kidding me? We're gonna miss the horn. 7:53 p.m. Never mind! - I was looking for you! - We're supposed to meet at the subway. - That was too specific. - Well, yeah. Calm. - And he has a 4 year old little girl. - How is she? Don't know, I haven't met her yet. - No, his ex. How is she? - Oh, his ex? - I only know her from afar. - Wait, I'm having a flash. She wanted a second child, he didn't. Suddenly, she cheated on him, he found out. She returned to the arms of her first young love, the type of guy from inter-religious scouting, a Christophe. You know what I mean? So they have a five-year-old girl, and he left? No, dad, he didn't leave. I just said it was she who left him. If he is so good, why did she leave him? - Oh God... - Are you kidding? - I was just asking a question! - Dad, you're aging badly! I'm not aging badly. I was just at Margaret's, my acupuncturist. She told me I was doing great! She got me back in shape. She heals everything. Of course. Then I want her number, Simon has hives right now. Really? - Purulent? - No. I can't talk about it, it's... I knew it was the kind of joke I shouldn't make. - He has pimples? - Everywhere? And you, Rachel? - What? - For internships. - What about them? - Did you fill in the table? No, I didn't fill in the table, but I have someone. - Yeah? The name of the referent? - Benattia, Ali. - OK. His number or email? - 06 45 15 68 22. A description? - Brown, 1.95m, athletic... - Not that. A job description. Automotive designer. - That's great. - Yeah, I know. Dylan? Dylan? Can you stay for two seconds? Just two seconds. - Yes? - Did you find your internship yet? Because I have something that might interest you. - What? Remember when you told me about the traveling carnival with your uncles, that you'd love to know how all the machines worked? Automotive designer. I think you might like it. - And where is it? - It's at Croix de Chavaux. Forget it, I'm not interested. The school pays for all transportation that week. And the company pays for all the lunches. OK? Think about it and let me know. Thanks. Where are the ashtrays again? The cabinet above the TV. There! - Hello, Mrs. Diabara... - Excuse us. - No, no bother at all... - Come in, come in! - We meet at last! - Good evening. A pleasure, Ali. Mia, pleasure to meet you. Ali. I want to meet her. I want to meet Leila. - Really? - Evidently, you think I'm joking? No. It wasn't evident, you know, other people's children sometimes... You ever notice people who have children complain about it all the time? It is to deflect the joy of having them. I can confirm, she is adorable. But she can be a pain in the ass too. You're a bit far there, come here. Come here. Take that off, it's hot. - Do you have any? - No. Am I the only one? You're the only one. Am I the only one? Oh, Ali! Wait, I'm counting. I'm not on the pill. We'll do something else. Good morning. - Rachel, Leila. - Hello! Are you saying hello? But what am I seeing? I was expecting a little girl, but I see a big one. How old are you? - Manners, are you gonna answer? - Four and a half years. - And a half. - And a half, it's important! - No, no, no! - Oh yeah... - No, no, Leila! - Oh yes! - Yes? - Come on! Well, yes then. - Which ones do you want? - Those! Up there! - Are they your favorites? - Yes! - Rainbows? - Yes. Me too! Could we have that candy pack? Thanks. Thanks. - Gonna say thank you? - Thank you! - Did you say thank you? - Yes, she said it. Food-wise, it's not the best. Bur on the field deserted by the army of the Grand Duke, Wonder bears discover plenty of stuff. Such generosity, these men! Look. They left us lots of things. Saltpetre, an elegant and ambitious bear. He is fascinated by men. Maybe a little too much. Mémé comes to my room, and he tells me stories. - No way... - Yes. Does daddy know, or is it your secret? It's a secret! - Mémé, come! - Yeah! - Don't move. - What a nice dog. - Don't move. - Oh what are you doing? Sweetheart, time for bed. Come here, come on. Say good night, my night. - Good night. - Why does he call you "my night"? Because Leila, means night in Arabic. Wow, that's so beautiful! So good night, my night. - Give her a kiss? - Can I give you a little kiss? There you go! - We're going to put on our pa... - ...jamas! - We'll brush our... - Teeth! - And we're going to read a... - Story! "Grr grr", says the monster behind Bernard's mom! "Not now, Bernard," says the mother. She still thinks it's her son. The monster bites Bernard's dad's leg... "Not now, Bernard" says the dad. Will you stay a while, at least? Yes. At least. What? You okay? If it bothers me that you're here when she wakes up, It's not because I think it would go wrong. It's just that... I need to talk to Alice about it first. Yeah, that's between you two, it's your business. And you don't have to justify yourself, Ali. You know... I'm fine taking it slowly. You know, I find that admirable, actually. You are a nice guy. - Wait... - What? You didn't finish your sentence there. I'm a nice guy... Despite everything, is that it? Exactly, despite everything. Hush. Dad! Do you hear a noise? I heard something. Dad! - No, wait. - Dad! - She's going to go back to sleep. Hold on. Dad! - Go ahead. - I'll be back! - What's the matter, baby? - I just had a nightmare. - I was scared. - Is it because of the story? Yes... I want to sleep in your bed. No, no. You know you can't do that. - I'm going to your bed. - I said no. Where are you going? - I'm going to your bed. - No, Leila, what did I say? Shit... Yes, what do you want? Want a cigarette? A lighter? Some water? Sorry. - Are you cold? - No, not at all. - Everything okay? - Yes... It's no "folie in the follicle" I see some, but not many. What does that mean? It means that if you want a child, Now is the time. You want kids? Yes. Why did you wait so long? Do you have the dad? I just met someone, yes. Listen to me. If you want to start an assisted thing, it's now. Hurry up! It's like a countdown has started. You know that. And how much time do I have left? I ask myself the same question every morning. So? - It's not exact science. - How much approximately? Think of months as if they're years. Now I'm going to look at your breasts. - Pardon? - Your breasts. Oh, sorry. - Can I try this one? - Yeah it's for you. Tell me, this is going to sound weird to you, but do you remember if mom was already menopausal or not? I have no idea. Just ask Wiseman. Why? Just a thought. Just a thought? You have time, Rachel. No? Come on, let's change the subject. OK. Let's talk about dad's prostate, right? You're high! You're distracting me!

See you next week. - Goodbye, my little angel. - Goodbye, Mommy. See you soon my Love. You okay, Alice? You look quite pale. Seeing Jeanne like that makes me... You're crying. She's a close friend of yours? I get it, it's heartbreaking. - It'll be fine, I'm sure. - I don't want her to see me... No, she doesn't see you from there. Thank you, Rachel. It happens... - Yes, it does. - Yes. - See you soon. - See you soon. Why are you doing this? Do you know how lucky it is to do an internship here? But he works at least, when he is there. Except when he's ripping the local supplies. - What? - It's nothing, Rachel, who cares. No! Alright, Dylan, that's enough. You express yourself there, Shit. I'm talking to you. I don't understand this job, I want something simple. Simple. Simple how? I don't know, telephony, Restoration... It's not the same thing. Tell us what you prefer: Is it telephony, is it restoration, what is it? Restoration. Well, that's great. Okay, no problem. We offered lots of internships in restoration, didn't you see? - I did... - So why didn't you... - I'll let you settle this. - We'll be done shortly. - Goodbye, Dylan. - Ali... I'm sorry. I don't care if you're sorry. I don't want that, I want you to move ahead. People won't care about you. So move your ass a little. Okay? Do you have such little love for yourself? - You forgot your coat. - I don't have a coat. Are you serious? I'm not cold. How much did you pay for it? That's not the point... That's not point... Yes, that's point. If I was mean, I'd say it's narcissism. But since I love you, I'll say you're too kind. Didn't I tell you it was going to be a waste of time? I know kids like that. Oh. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why is Rachel here all the time? Because she's my lover. - No, mom is your lover. - No. I love mom so much, but Rachel is my lover. - No. - You're tired, let's go to bed. But why is she here all the time? She is often here, not all the time. I want her to go away. Did you lower the heat on the sauce? You know it doesn't mean anything, Rachel, she's five! At that age, it means nothing. Of course I know, but that doesn't stop me from feeling sorry. I don't know. - What don't you know? - I don't know, it's not about you. She does the same to her mother! And the same to me too! It's not about me, are you serious? From the beginning, I aligned myself with your schedule. I met her when you wanted. I dine and sleep when it suits you. Same for holidays, day care. I didn't think these were concessions. Stop it Please. Stop. Are you pretending not to understand that I'm getting attached to her? You see, I too have to deal with her sulks, her moods. Except that I actually... I will always remain an extra. - You're exaggerating. - No, I'm not exaggerating. You say she does the same to you, except I don’t know what it feels like... to have what she gives you. At the end of the day, you're her mom and dad, forever. I'm ashamed, that's it. - Of what? - Of this conversation! But why? Because it's banal, I feel banal. This girl in the street who tells you "I want a child". I blame you for making me realize that. Rachel, I know how old you are. And I'm not 25 either. But... We have time, we have all the time. Well exactly, we don't have that much time. I'm afraid it won't be possible anymore soon. Compassionate God who dwells in heaven, grant perfect rest on the wings of the divine presence, in this supreme abode of the saints and the pure whose name shines like the light of the firmament to the soul of our mother Nora, daughter of Joseph of the house of Lévy... Who has gone for eternity. So the merciful will cover her eternally with his protective wings And will join her soul in the divide of life. May she rest in peace. Amen. Amen. You only put one? Exactly, I asked myself the question. I don't know. I don't know if he is considered already alive. Or if as long as he isn't completely alive, it is not a life. - You following me? - Yes. Well, Precisely in Judaism, the fetus is not considered a full human being. Oh okay. Are we the only ones okay with abortion? I love that idea. According to the Mishna, to take the life of a newborn, even of a few hours, it's a crime. But in the case of a fetus, then, it's debatable, it depends on the rabbi. So, one or two? - Clutch, Gear up. - And then I go second gear? And then, you go second gear. - Stop... - OK, yes, yes, yes. - Take it easy! - We're not going to run over anyone. It's not them that I'm afraid for, it's my car. Your car is two centuries old. - We'll go see Foufounette. Okay? - Okay. - It's been so long! - Do you think she changed, Foufounette? Let go of Foufounette, that miserable. No dad, we do what we want! Well anyway, where she is, she won't move anymore. This is hilarious. I think Foufounette would make a great podcast topic. I would like to tell her story, potentially a made-up story, Because nobody knows Foufounette. I think she had a relationship with Richard... Now there's a happy case, Linda Lo, we all agree, huh... What do we write to Linda Lo? For me, it's immediate congratulations. - An excellent average. - It's not often we agree like this. That's why we should be happy. So... Oh, uh... Dylan Leclou. I think we are all in agreement too? Internship class, I'm not taking it again next year. I agree, Fadila. It's impossible. Too much absenteeism. It's not even absenteeism anymore. He comes when he wants, and when I say that, it's so rare. He's more absent than present. I know he has family difficulties, but that's no reason to excuse everything. Sorry, can I say something? I agree with your observation. But I don't think we mobilized all our resources. And there are still things to do, to undertake, We have done more, with other students in the past, we can't give up. So the internship class for me, has to stay. Rachel, you can't just say that we gave up. And did you see his notes? The notes, we know what they mean and what they don't mean. I know he would need... It's not him who would need, it's also us who need him. I mean from him, from them. From his generation. We can't say that it's over at 16, That there is no more hope. That's not possible. Me, I felt in him, I saw in a concrete way, an opening, a space. I have to make this heard, I can't take my hand away. Otherwise it makes no sense, actually. Otherwise what, what are we? A stepping stone? No. It's important. I agree with Rachel. Of course, he is well below the class average. It's true. But I have seen real progress, in his speaking and in initiative. That's something we have to acknowledge. Otherwise what's the point? He is 16 years old. He still has the right to a chance. He shows no will. - He showed some. - In my class, he shows some. In one out of 10 classes... What he says deserves to be heard, though. They are right. He is only 16 years old. Shall we keep him for next year? Do we agree? We'll take care of that. - Okay, we'll keep him then. - We'll keep him. Rejoice, everyone! We will have Dylan next year. Which one?

What will my students say, If I don't grade these? - What is dad doing? - I don't know. Me neither. The news are not good, about Elsa's mom. Alice says to expect the worst. It drives me crazy to have to tell Leila, if it ever... The first thing to tell her, in my opinion, Is reassuring her about her own mother. That it won't happen to her, that her mom isn't sick. I know, but Alice doesn't want us to talk about it. Period. Really, but why? You absolutely have to talk to her about it, I assure you. You have to be able to name things, so that she herself can talk about them. - I know what I'm talking about. - I know, but you know Alice. Well no, exactly, you don't know her, but... when she has something in mind... If she has something in mind... What's planned for Saturday? - Saturday? - Leila's birthday. She'll be with us so, I thought of something... I was about to tell you... We're going to do it at Alice's parents. They are in Essonne. They have a big garden. It's hard to say no to her grandparents. I didn't say anything. Don't feel left out, my Rachel. It's just that... This year, it was easier to do this one as a family. Madam, mobile phones are prohibited for everyone during the exams. Hush. Rachel, we are with my parents in Essonne. I wanted to tell you, thank you for understanding. Leila is talking about you. See you soon, Alice. Wait for me! You okay? So so. - Do you have anything planned this afternoon? -Yes. Stop, you have nothing planned. - I do, I assure you. - No. I feel that you have nothing planned. Come on, I'll take you to lunch. I was with my high school sweetheart, Paul. He works at a big newspaper now. I thought... We're not going to think about it, then one day, It will happen, and we will keep it. It will be like that, it will be obvious. Then the day came. And I didn't keep it. He was mad at me, I think. He would have liked it. But... we never talked about it again. And I know that... No. That what? If I still had my mother with me, I would have made a different decision. How old were you when she died? Nine years. That's too young to lose a mom. How did she die? Car accident. I was with her. That's rough. But I think... I think that's why I'm so late. I wait until it's too late. Because it reminds me of her. Is it that bad not to have one? Bad, no. I don't think a woman is complete just by having one, but... I even believe that somewhere in me, I am proud to... Belong to the community of women who have none, but still. It's like... A huge collective experience, that the whole world is going through And to which I don't have access. I would have forced you to have a child for me. You say that because deep down, you are a child yourself. Sorry, Vincent. Look. It's day. Ready? Let's go! - Dad! - All good? I knocked the judo teacher down and hurt myself. - Oh dear, all that? - In my feet. All that... Oh shit. shit, shit! Fucking shit! No, no, no. Leila, don't do that, please. - I'm driving here. - My tummy hurts. I feel like throwing up. We're almost there, We'll open the windows. - I really want to throw up. - Breathe. You're okay. You're okay. No, put your belt back on, it's very important. You put your belt back on now! Put your belt back on! Put it back. - I'm gonna throw up. - No, no no! Oh god. I can't believe this... Wait... Shit! Here. You're alright, we're almost there. We're going to stop for a minute. How do these shitty buttons work? So, are you okay my angel? Come on, I'll put your belt back on. You okay? You were scared? Okay. It's okay now. It's done. Sorry for yelling. Leila! My baby! My night! My love! How are you? - Good. - Any boo boos? No. I was scared. I was so scared. - Are you okay? - I'm sorry. - Did you see a doctor? - Yes, it's nothing. - And you, did you see a doctor? - Yes. - No? Yes? - You weren't hurt? No boo boos? - No. We're going home, okay? What do you wanna do? - Did you know Louana gave birth? - That's good. How did it go? Good. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? That Jeanne was dead. I didn't want to bother you with that. - With these sad news. - Bother me? But it's my life too. Ali, look at me. I only have one life, and it's with you. What happens to you, happens to me too and vice versa, right? I was wrong, I have it all wrong. - I'm sorry. - No, but... I know, Rachel. I know. I'm so tired right now. ♪ "Again" ♪ ♪ (Doris Day) ♪ Leave me alone! Shit! Rachel, stop! I don't love her anymore, you know that? It's true, Rachel. Please stop... I think that deep down, neither does she. It's no coincidence, that we meet around a funeral. She shouldn't have asked me that. To try again, to ask me to come back. But... Now that she asked me, I can't tell her no. I understand. Actually, no, I don't understand. Why? For Leila. Now she's here, she's in my life. My choices aren't just my choices. I'm not going to tell you that you'll understand one day, but... - But that's what you're doing. - But it's genuinely what I think. I sincerely, deeply, wish that this happens to you. Really. Even if it won't be with me. I understand that. I feel trapped. I'm trapped too. Trapped? You? What are you trapped in? You want to love, you love. You don't want kids, you don't have any. You still want children, no problem. It's whatever you want. What are you trapped in? Nothing at all. For me, it's too late. I'm trapped because I love you. Please, stop. Stop. - You're not sleeping? - I don't feel sleepy. - Why are you crying? - I'm not crying, sweetheart. - Did you have a nightmare? - A little nightmare that will pass. - Here, take my moon. - Thank you. How nice of you. I don't want you to cry. Should we make a sandwich? Yeah, we'll make a sandwich. Wanna make the cheese? - The salad. - The salad, okay. Come. Daddy, you make the bread. - I have to go. - No, stay here. Come on. - I have to go, it's late. - No, stay. - Come on, sweetheart. - No. Stay. - We're going to bed. - It's bedtime. - Stay here. - Honey. Do you promise me that you'll stay? All right. I'll see you tomorrow morning. I'll make you breakfast. Good night, Rachel. Good night, my night. I blame you, Ali. I know. I know you know. Rachel! - Feeling good, sweetheart? - Yes. How was it? It went well? - Was it fun? - Look at my casserole! Oh, you made a casserole? Come on, I got you your snack. Shall we go? Remember when we used to go for a walk? - Yes. - Yeah? Careful! - So, who will take me to judo? - Lots of people. Lots of people you love. Will we still see each other? Leila, it's not up to me to decide anymore. But maybe, yes. But much less than before. It doesn't mean I'll stop thinking of you. One, two, three, hop! - Is it because you're going to die? - No. No, no, not at all! I will be alive and well. Are you going on a trip, then? No, I'll be... I'll be in the same town, I'll be alive, But we won't see each other like before. Can we go on vacation, you and me? No, we won't go on vacation anymore. - You see, that's over. - I'm sad then. No, no. I don't want that. I don't want you to be sad. Never. So you don't forget me, but you don't think about me too much. Okay? - Hello. - Hello, Alice. Here we are. Mommy! I'm sorry, Rachel. No. It's Ali who's making me suffer, it's not you. We're going to stop apologizing on behalf of men. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Rachel. - Goodbye, Alice. Bye. I'll go get the mail, I'm coming. Saturday... Sunday... Hello, Rachel. There are still ways, you know? But chances are slim. Yeah, I know. Did you talk about it with the dad? There's no dad anymore. But yes, we'll see. Life is short and long. Indeed. Life is long. Thank you. - Can you keep it for 5 minutes? - My baby! Go ahead, no worries. - Can I leave you two? - Yes, of course. Will you leave mom alone? - I'll leave you with Auntie. - Mom will leave you alone too. Go on! Go for it. - So, I'll leave you two. - See you later, darling. Oh no, look, you dropped your cookie! Look, my little darling. Look, did you see this? Did you see this? There you go. Mémé, come! Mémé, sit! Don't move! Leila! Leila! Okay, it's good! Arnaud, start with the library. Sorry, I'm late. Oh shit! sorry, excuse me. No, stay! "Epilogue" Madam Friedman? Can I? Dylan! Yes of course! But you... You, you... You work here? Yeah. It's incredible to see you here! Do you come often? Sometimes, yes. - Are you a server? - Head waiter, careful! - That's amazing! - Mimou! The lady doesn't pay, put it on my bill. Oh be careful, I'll come back every day. I'm real happy to see you. It's a sign. - A sign of what? - Fate. You haven't changed at all. Oh how I did. But it's okay. - Are you good here? - Yeah, very much. It's cool. We have a good team. I'm glad you work in a place you like. Thank you. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. I was a little jerk. I caused you trouble. I often thought of you, and I never came to see you. The important thing is that you can do without me. - Are you still at Maurice Ravel? - Yes. And now we can see each other. All is fixed. When I wanted to see you in recent years, it was to thank you. I wanted to tell you that you left a mark on me. I wanted to tell you that... That I haven't forgotten you. Dylan, come here, we need you. I'll be back, don't move. ♪ "Les eaux de Mars" ♪ ♪ (Georges Moustaki) ♪ OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE @KG
