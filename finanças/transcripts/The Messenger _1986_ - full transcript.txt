(dramatic music) - What the hell you mean you got nothing to do with it? You used as much of this shit as I did. Listen, I'm telling you these guys are serious. Eight kilos missing ain't no joke. You can't screw the syndicate in the States and expect them to the turn the other cheek. (dramatic music) (chuckling) Oh, yeah. That's what you think. That's bullshit. If it's my ass, it's yours too. (dramatic music) - Ciao, Luigi, (speaking foreign language). - What is this? - Judgment day. - I stole nothing. I just don't have it. - Those are both wrong answers. - [Thug] Goodbye, Luigi. (gun fires) (upbeat funky music) (mellow music) (knocking on door) - Enter. - Good morning, Warden Palmiero. The American is ready. - Ah, yes. Jake Sebastian Turner. Bring him in. Well, Jake. Three years, eh? Has it gone by quickly? - It could have been quicker. - Now that you are going, prison a weary place. No music to calm my nerves. Nobody to play chess with. Look at that problem there. Drink? Three days I struggled with that problem. - I'm waiting. - What? - Come on, Louie. Gimme the lecture so I can get outta this place, will ya? - It's not often we get one as fine as you, Jake. A true artist. A true gentleman, though you were a crook. All along wherever I go, people still whisper your name as one of the (speaking foreign language) cat burglars of all time throughout Europe. I can only hope that is all behind you, and you go back to your music. - Music never went anyplace. - Yeah, but that truly did. I don't understand. You like to act like you don't know what I'm talking about. I hope for your sake, there are no sudden increase of robberies, or you'll be back in here. And I'd hate to see that, my friend. In fact, if I was you, I'd leave Europe and go back to the boat that you came on.

And you, sir? - Jake. - Sebastian Turner. - The legendary Jake Sebastian Turner? - If that's how you feel about it. - Oh, please forgive me. (chuckles) This is Molly. - But why, why? Why do you speak to me when you have a (mumbling)? - Isn't she sweet? Oh, Jake, will you please come in and join us. Make yourself at home. There are several rooms for pleasure, you understand. You will excuse me. Thank you. - Why? Why isn't he... - Come on, do as De Santis says, love. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. (mellow jazz music) (slow romantic music) I believe this is my dance. - (chuckles) Okay. Sabrina. - Yes? - Thanks for waiting. - I love you. - The feeling is mutual.

I keep telling you I have nothing to do with Luigi's crazy ideas. Stop bothering me. I'll pay you. I'm through. (suspenseful music) - Where could she put eight kilos of coke? - Up her nose, up her cunt. How do I know? - Maybe she doesn't have it. - Just follow the orders and leave the maybes to me. - If you don't like the coke, there is another room, for fun? - [Sabrina] Looks like you could use some help. - Nice talking to you, Ma'am. Problems on the phone? - No, nothing important. - Drink? - Uh, Sebastian? There's so much that's happened to me in the past few years that you don't know about. - Wanna talk about it? - I'd like to try, when we get home. - All right. - Maybe by then, I will have figured out a way. (dramatic music) - Here she comes. (dramatic music) - Sebastian. (dramatic music) [Man] No. No. (grunting) (dramatic music) (sirens blaring) - Four dead tonight. This way. One in the car. Two over there. One dead. - Where is Senor Turner? - There. - Get rid of that corpse. (engine starting) (dramatic music) So, you are responsible for all this mess. And they started shooting at you first. Is that right? - I told them everything. - Oh, perhaps, yes, yes. Perhaps. - Perhaps what? - Perhaps someone had an old vendetta out for you. - [Jake] Yeah well, they had three years. - I remember your case quite well. I was a rookie at the time. You just got out of prison. So there is obviously a lot you don't know about your wife there now. - Obviously. - She was, what you would call, a shady character. She might have dealings in something illegal. And this was evidently a professional hit. Orders probably came from someone high up. - Fact or fiction? - Speculation. - She had lovers, Mr. Turner. Like Cesar, she was every man's wife and every woman's husband. As I said before, you obviously knew nothing about your wife's affairs. - Yeah, you're right. And there's a lot I don't wanna know. But what I do know is that for one a month, for three years, she dragged her butt up to prison to see me. Now, that means more to me than whose fly she unzipped or whose tits she sucked.

(woman crying) (upbeat funky music) - Next time you want to kick some ass, try a man. - Please, Mr. Turner, spare him. He has his problems, but he is such a great caretaker. - I'm gonna kill you! (sobbing) (upbeat funky music) - I'm glad you could make it. A drink, Mr. Turner? - Let's get to the point quick, Gieldgud. - They say information is power, Mr. Turner. The information I got on you I find quite fascinating. Former Vietnam vet, weapons expert, a Green Beret, and a musical prodigy of sorts. Born and raised in Chicago. - I know my story, Gieldgud, what's yours? - Two weeks ago, my stepson, Luigi, has been killed by the same group of people that had your Sabrina killed. I met Sabrina through Luigi, few years back. I can't tell you how devastated I am that they are both gone. But, by killing those men you only scratch the surface. I want to pay you $500,000 to get the people responsible for this. The ones who gave the orders to have them killed. - How was Sabrina involved in this? - She was part of a drug syndicate that stretched from here to the United States. She was trying to get out, but it was not possible. - It's tempting. - As I say, it's the people at the top I want. - $500,000 is a lot of money, Mr. Gieldgud. - I'm willing to pay you more if that's not enough, Mr. Turner. I know you are man for the job. You can stay here for a few days and think about it. And don't turn your back to the caretaker. I'd hate to lose you so soon. - After three years in prison, Mr. Gieldgud, even my back has developed eyes. - Come on, give it to me. - Nicole. - That's not fair. - [Man] I don't care about fair. - Hey, looks like Nicole has a new friend. - Please? Give it to me. - We'll be back later for this, Nicole. - Give it to me. (guys chuckling) - Your uncle always use you for a punching bag? - Not always. - How old are you? - 19. - So why don't you leave this place? - We all have our place in life, Mr. Turner. Mine's here. - Those two boys I saw you with. Tell me about them. - Oh, they're just, just friends of mine. - What do they do, where do they come from? - They're just locals, I don't know. - So, tell me about them. - Hey, man, are you jealous or something? You're asking too many questions. - What was that I saw them put in your pocket? - [Nicole] Nothing, you're seeing things. - [Jake] So, what do you need this for? - Give it, that's mine. You don't know what it's like to have an uncle that beats you every goddamn day. This made it a little easier for me. - So, how do you pay for it, Nicole? (crying) (dramatic music) - Ciao, Nicole, hey, we came to collect our fee. - Hey, listen, I changed my mind. Please, okay, I'll give you the coke back. Please. - We got enough dough. Now, you can join us-- - I'll give you the money. Please, get out of here. Please, don't. - C'mon, don't scream, you don't wanna be loud. - [Nicole] (crying) No, please. Please. No, please, don't! (crying) (dramatic music) (grunting) - Peddle your stuff someplace else. - [Man] Right. You won't be seeing us again. (dramatic music) - I'll take the job, Gieldgud, for Sabrina. - Well, I am certainly surprised at your immediate response. But, uh, I must say, I'm delighted. - I'll pack my things. (upbeat funky music) - Please. Please don't. Please. Please. Please don't. (Nicole crying) Jake, I tried to stop him. I tried. (crying) - It's okay, kid, it's okay.

He sold her on the fast way to make that dough with him. She got hooked. Was it him? - No, they burned him too. Look, Benny, I know you're wired. Who was your contact here in Chicago? - A real sleaze named Sweet Louie. But Luigi did business with the big boys. - Then they're next, after Sweet Louie. - They're mafia, Jake.

Gang land stuff or what? - Strange. It seems after Louie was off, the guy took his dope and he threw it into a spit to him. Full of crap. (Carter laughing) - Well, the man's got style. At least we know he didn't want the dope. So, think we should give him a medal? - Why don't you sit down, Mr. Parker. He's got style, and we give him a medal, must be quite a guy. Leroy, you got a description? - In a joint like that? You couldn't get 'em to ID a toilet paper. See no evil. Capiche? - [Carter] Well, Mr. Drug Stomper, you're playing in my precinct now. What you gonna do about this? - [Parker] I'll probably watch it on the 11 o'clock news. - On the news? - Yeah. Maybe it's a, um, a serial killer. - You know, Leroy, we better start watching TV. You might pop up on 60 minutes or, better still, you might wind up on Barbara Walters. An oddball, fucking shit!

No, no, please. - You comfortable, Mr. Parker? (grunting) - This goddamn city is weird. Blows away two guys, and he strolls out. He didn't care if he's made or not. Now, that's, uh, that's suicide stuff to me. There's got to be a connection somewhere. - And I'm sure you're gonna tell me all about it. - Did you know that Paolo was indicted several times. - Several times? - Yes, several times. Drug monster. And never convicted once. I've been doing some checking. Sweet Louie testified at Paolo's trial. Now get this. Louie got five years suspended sentence for selling dope, supposedly, from supplies brought in from Paolo in Europe. - What do you think? You think I'm some goddamn dummy? We all know! All America knows. It's always the little guy they pick up. He's the one that's visible. The big guys, the guys like Paolo, they're the ones, but they are all hidden behind legitimate fronts.

Gentleman over there wanted to see you after you're done. - You know him? - No, never saw him before. - Let's see what he wants. - I have a business proposition for both of you. I have $5 million at your disposal. - What are you, some kind of kook? - These are the banks where the money is. - [Man] What's the catch? - No catch. I wanna buy in. - Buy in? In to what? A tool company? - No. Your dope business. - What the hell do you mean, dope? Are you a cop or something? - No, I'm a man with money that wants more. Read this. Now, I'm not bluffing, I want in. I know you're in business with Harris in San Francisco and Rico in Las Vegas. So, I suggest you call them and tell them about my offer. Now, you have six hours before I change my mind and start eliminating the competition. Have a game, fellas. - Hey, where will I find you? - I'll find you. - Now what do we do? - Don't worry about it. Just go home, make yourself a drink. I'll take care of it. - Want me to contact Rico? - I said I'll take care of it. Now go home and play with your wife. - You're funny. Real funny.

I mean kill, dead, bang, you know what I mean? - You are serious, aren't you? - Yeah. - Why don't we call the police? - (laughs) Now, that's a joke. - Why? - Read the paper, the headlines. - Come on, this isn't funny. - Who's laughing? Listen, honey, where do you think I get the money to buy this house? Those two cars, the cabin? You think from the tool company? - You mean drugs? You've been dealing drugs? - Yeah, not just dealing. The tool company is only a, a front to launder millions of dollars of drug money. It's big business. - But, how could you? What about our kids? - What about 'em? You think we can afford the nice big college he's going to? Or the private school for Mary on tool company money? - What about all the other kids out on the street whose lives are destroyed because of drugs? And because of people like you! - Come on, don't give me that high and mighty bullshit! You live pretty good. You wanna change now that you know where the money's coming from? Okay. Give back the minks you have in the closet. Hand over the diamonds in the safe. Turn in the Mercedes. Go on! Let me see you give up all this comfort. Bullshit. - You're nothing, Emerson. You're no better than the people who are out there selling it for you. I hope he kills you slowly. So that you can suffer the way your family will and the people whose lives you've destroyed. - Bitch! (Mrs. Emerson crying) Damn you, get out of here! Get out of here! Get the hell out of here!

What is it? What do you want from me? Look I got money, jewels, and drugs. Take it, take it all. There's a million dollars of stuff in the next room. Just... (crying) Just don't kill me. - [Jake] What's the matter, you afraid to die? Don't worry. It'll be over quick. - [Mrs. Emerson] Shoot him! (guns firing) - Either use it, or hand it over. I'll get rid of the gun for ya. - The police, what should I say? - Just tell them, he was killed by an intruder, and if I were you, I'd get rid of the dope in the other room. - How can I ever thank you? - Just put flowers on my grave. (upbeat funky music) - We didn't have any enemies in the whole world. He was a beloved husband, and a good father, and a true Christian. And... To be killed so violently at the hands of an intruder, I... If you need any more information, you can reach me in Las Vegas. I have to get away. Thank you. - [Jake] Time is marching on, Clark. I don't like the counter offer your friends made. Also, you can count Emerson out of your next deal. - [Clark] Wait a minute. I talked to the others, and they're interested. They want to meet in Las Vegas. - Good idea. Tell them I'll meet them there in two days. (dramatic music) (Carter clearing throat) - This just came in from L.A. Same M.O. as the other killings. The only thing is our guy uses a .357 Magnum. - Mr. Parker, Mr. Emerson was killed with a .38 caliber pistol. Now, he was a big dope dealer. We knew and we know that, but we couldn't prove it. Ah, go ahead and tell him, Leroy. - The difference with this guy is, he was connected with partners in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. - Have there been any hot drug deals in L.A. lately? - We got a bulletin about three hoods, known coke muscle, being blown away in the street. - By a lone guy? - By a lone guy. - Just strolled away? - He just strolled away. - Goddammit, it's death wish himself. That sucker's cool. - [Leroy] How did you make what he did? - [Carter] Yeah, how? - Instincts. - Bullshit. - Only us Feds have it. Should have been a Fed. - Your superiors know that you're a crime groupie? - Yeah, they know I'm a butt man too. I'm going to L.A., see if I can find a link. (upbeat funky music) (people chatting) - [Man] Come on, let's check it out. - You should try it. - You sure it'll be good? - Tell me what you think. - Well, look, yeah, I like the idea of no interest and no pay back. When can I have the money? - Whenever you want it. - How about tomorrow night? - [Jake] That's fine with me. When I'm set, I'll name the time and the place. I'll have a wire sent to each of my banks in cash tomorrow. - (sighs) Very good. You know, I like your style, paisano. Maybe I'll make you an honorary Italiano. Yeah, sure, okay, ciao. Until tomorrow night, okay? - You tell me. - It's good flavor. - Yeah. All right, let's get some, let's party. Get down and have a good time. I'm ready. - Let's do it. It's good stuff, let's do it. - [Man] Yeah, it's good, let's get some more of it. - Excuse me. I see an exterminator who cleaned the large rat out of my house. Well, fancy meeting you here. May I? - Please. You certainly seemed to have recovered pretty fast. - Why not? Maybe I didn't know what living was before. Maybe I've been dead for 10 years. - Does that mean you didn't get rid of the stuff like I asked you to? - Look now, if I kept it, I kept it for me, not to sell on the street, you understand? Don't include me on your list. Look, you don't scare me. I know who you are. - [Man] You don't understand. Let me handle this-- - She's gotta party with us. You do it. - Trust me, I know what I'm doing. - Look, here she comes now. - She's gonna be a hard one. Let me handle this. - Okay, let's get down to business. 500 in cash in a half hour.

First of all-- - Give it up, huh? - Give it up. First of all, this shit ain't even ours. - Take it. - We met some broad at the bar, some blonde. What's her name, Ingrid? - That's right, that's right, that's right. - This shit'll get you five years. - What are you doing giving it back to me? - What's going on, man? - Wet it down. - Take it to the sink, wet it down. - Okay, okay. - This is a bathroom. - Oh man, you don't want me to piss on him, golden shower. - You want me to get security? - No, no, no. - No, no, just do it.

What the hell's wrong with you? - [Man] I'll just send your pants to the fucking cleaners. You wanna do five years?

Master people, and don't push me. - That's right. Nine o'clock. Outside Las Vegas, Phillips Road. - [Rico] Your wish is my command. - Asshole. (suspenseful music) - [Thug] Hey, paisano! We got something for you from Rico. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Oh, shit. What took you so long? - Not you again. Look, I don't care if you're a Fed. You back off my case. Now, I got some hardball playing friends in high places who'd smash your nuts for fun. And the way you keep praising the vigilante freak, will cause them to lean heavily on you. You got that? - You should have gotten laid last night. Relieve the tension. - You're gonna get yours, son of a bitch. You ready, Mr. Parker? Go. (upbeat funky music) Like an almighty Fed, the butt man. Let's see if his ass is bullet proof. - I want him to say, "I'll bring the money tonight." - Freeze! - What kind of nut are you? - Hard hearing, butt wipe. No nasty weapons. - Well you just met the nut cracker suite. - You're surrounded! Drop your weapons! This is police business. Unlatch your weapons and drop them on the ground. - Hey, look, pal, you see too many movies, we don't go for that here. - Carter! Get your ass in here. We're on the same team, Carter! Carter, Carter! - You got a big stupid mouth. - Carter? (chuckling) Carter? (men laughing) - You called, Mr. Parker? Okay folks, show is over. - Hey, what's going on? Who are you? So? - Got it all wrong, I ask, you answer. First, put the heat away. - All right, go ahead. - Didn't you know that pointing a gun at an officer of the law is hazardous to your health. - You're in deep shit now, suckfish. - Hey, look, I'm charging you with illegal entry. - You can charge him or me with anything. But I'm telling you, you are going to jail, Rico. - Oh yeah? - We'll take care of the other guy. - Why is that, I'm a citizen. - Are you? - I have a right to bear arms, protect my property. - Ah, bullshit. Clark and Harris, I presume. - I'm Harris. - Clark here. What are the charges against Rico? - I beg your pardon? - I said, what are the charges against Rico? - Charges? - Yeah. - No charges. - No charges. (laughs) - Protective custody. - Ho, ho, ho, you-- - Protective custody my ass. It's just a waste of tax payers money. Protective custodies... We should take these shit sticks, and blow them away and flush them down a toilet, every last one of them. - You know, that's the first thing you've said, Mr. Parker, I agree with. I hate treating these creeps with kid gloves. Hate it. - Maybe we should let our friend do it, you know. Be a lot easier, and a lot cheaper. - A lot cheaper. - What do you mean, what friend? What is this, what kind of double talk is that? - Yeah. - Just what are you getting at, squirt? - Shut up. - Ooh, beautiful, you saw it. - Yeah I saw it. - You saw it, and Captain Carter saw it. - Yeah, I saw it. - I'm going to nail your ass. I'm going to have your badge. I think they call this police brutality, shorty. - Get back. - That's enough. That's fucking enough. - Fine. If your people don't pull their chain, I'm sure in the hell gonna do it. - [Carter] Now, to answer you, you sick bastards. Selling your sick shit to sick people. The authorities have known for a long time that you three have been guilty of drug smuggling. - Hey, I stand on the 5th Amendment. - [Clark] Yeah, I wanna see my lawyer. - I don't care what you think, I'm still going to sue your ass. - Go ahead, sue me. - I will. - Now we haven't been able to prove that you're dirty, but we know it. And there's something else we know. If you stay on the street, you're dead meat. - Hey, look, you don't give a damn about us. - That's right. But I care less for vigilante heroes. And we got one right now who's bending the letter of the law by icing a few top coke dealers. Doing a good job. Oh, he's got a list of names. Your, your names are on it. - What list? What kind of freak is this guy? - He praised himself as a messenger. You read the bible, there's something about the messenger of death. - (laughs) The what, the messenger of death? You know, you're really funny. (phone ringing) Holy shit. - What's the matter? Guilty conscience? - Yeah. Yeah, this is Rico, what do you want? - [Jake] Rico, we're supposed to be together at two, not get us in the Sloppy Head, come down. It's off, Rico, the game's over, you're a dead man. - [Rico] Um, are you the guy they call the messenger? - [Jake] Right to you and who ever picked up the telephone. Now don't try to put a trace on this call, you won't make it. Got any questions, good, because this is last message you'll get from me or anybody else. - That was him, Rico. That was the messenger. - It was? - Yeah. - He was right in front of me. - [Carter] Yeah. - He could have killed me then, why didn't he? - [Carter] I figured he wants to make you sweat first. - I'm sweating, don't worry about it. Oh, that's why you're here. Why don't you go out and get him? - Usually, I like everything about my job. But I hate this part, protecting rats like you. You go outside, flank the area. What's he look like? - He's tall, dark, with a hard face. You'll recognize him. - What are we supposed to do? Just sit around like clay pigeons or what? - Hey, I can't stand us sitting around. - Well, I don't know. Take a hike, it's your life. - Do something to get this show on the road. It's better, anything is better than this waiting. (banging on door) (upbeat funky music) - He's here. - Get him, get him! Order your men to get him. - Oh, he's coming! Here he is. - There's something on the roof. It looks like there's a fuse on it. - What the hell are you doing here? Go up and check it out, now. - Yes, sir. (upbeat funky music) (switches to dramatic music) Oh shit, it's dynamite! It's dynamite, there's dynamite out here. - Dynamite? - I'm getting the fuck out of here. - Harris! Clark, what's happening? Where are they going? Stop them. (dramatic music) Hey look, you're not going to leave me, are you? Stay with me, come on. - He's out there with a rifle and a telescope. - Oh no. For me? I'm a tax payer. It's your job to protect me. What the hell are you doing in here? You should be out there. Why don't you go out there and find him. - You don't find him, he's found us. - What about the dynamite on the roof? - Probably a dummy. To get you to run out of the house. Don't you move. (dramatic music) - I'm, I ain't moving. Oh yes, I ain't moving. (dramatic music) - It's a fucking grenade! - Rico! - Oh! (house explodes) - Looks like you owe him one now. - What's that supposed to mean? - He saved your ass with those phony grenades. - Yeah, son of a bitch sure did. He saved my ass. I'll be goddamn. - We can dispense with the formalities, Parker. I'm Conners, Chief FBI Field Inspector. I'm here to haul your ashes, clown. You don't screw up in front of witnesses. In private, I care a rat's butt. You could stomp his pecker off. You've been screwing up by the numbers, and now you got to pay. - Pay what? - They asked me to pull you in from this one, but I'm not. If you don't know how to play the game of kick a citizen's tail in private, I'm supposed to kick the hell out of you till you learn. Got that? - [Parker] Yeah. - What? - I said, yes sir. - What do you got to say for yourself praising this scumbag messenger the way you do? - He just seems like he's walking, talking death and destruction. He's clean, smooth, has nerves of steel. - I didn't ask for a sermon. - Okay, look, I've been doing some checking. This messenger stuff started about six months ago when a guy named Jake Sebastian Turner was released from prison in Italy. He blew away two guys who were connected with drugs, and they, in turn, blew away his wife. - You told me zero. Nothing. - Look, Turner's wife was connected with the drug dealers. If it was my wife, I'd be out there doing the same damn thing. - What are you trying to tell me? He's kind of a cocaine vigilante? - Yes, sir. - Well... You got another shot. But, no more public displays of affection for this scum. - You got it, sir. - That's all. (upbeat funky music) (funky music) (patrons chatting) (suspenseful music) - Goddammit, not another robbery. (guns firing) (screaming) (grunting) - Who sent you? Who sent you? Las Vegas Police Department, please. FBI Agent Parker. (phone ringing) Parker, I'm smart enough to know that my time is running out. I just called to let you know that the messenger is out of your-- - First call American Airlines Flight 202 for New York, now boarding, Concord C. - Bye now. (phone clicks) - Damn. He's not as smart as I thought he was. Jesus. (upbeat funky music) - TSA, Flight 41-- (upbeat funky music) Now boarding-- (upbeat funky music) - Hold it. Police. Excuse me, I thought you were somebody else. Mr.? - Jones. - Oh. Have a nice trip, and I hope we don't meet again, if you know what I mean, Mr. Jones. - Yeah. - Last call, Western Airlines. - Right. - Flight 96 for San Francisco, now boarding-- (upbeat funky music) (dramatic music) - You put a contract out on me. - It wasn't me. - You're lying, Gieldgud, it was you. That was a big mistake. - Turner, listen, you can make more money than you ever dreamed of. Now, I control most of the drug traffic into the States. We will make a good team. - No thanks, Gieldgud. You are scum, just like they are. - You're stupid, Turner. You will die for nothing. - One of us will, Gieldgud! (dishes shattering) (upbeat funky music)
