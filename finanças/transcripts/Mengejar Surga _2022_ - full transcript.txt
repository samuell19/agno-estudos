I've come to defend the love that I'm fighting for. Everything needs assurance. Even though there will always be an obstacle in every fight. I am hoping to find the answer at this place. Fatma, I need to tell my mother. -Okay, sure. Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too, Mom. I already arrived in Amsterdam. -Thank goodness. Fatma has picked you up? -She's with me now. How are you, Mom? -I am good, dear. How is grandma now? -She doesn't know yet. Please take care of yourself over there, okay? Yes, I will. Pray for me as always, Mom. I'll update you again later. I am going to Fatma's apartment. Take care, okay. -Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Amsterdam is well-known as the city of bikes... ...because we have more than 800,000 bikes in the city. That's why cars cannot go fast here. I see. I am sure you're tired. -Yes, quite tired. Tika. -Yes? You're engaged? What's the matter? It's beautiful, right? You're not answering me. You have no explanation? I'll tell you the story. Later I will tell you. -You have to, okay? Thank you. -Thank you so much. Here we are. House number 4. We are on the second floor. We need to take the stairs. I will help with your luggage. Okay, let's go. Can you hold it? -Yes. Here you go. Please come in. Welcome to my apartment. Do you want to take a rest? Maybe coffee or tea? No, it's okay. I want to take a shower now. All right. Your room is over here. So, please tell me, why did you come here? All right. What does this ring mean? Hendrik? Who is Hendrik? Curious? Wait a moment. Hello, peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. I am in Fatma's apartment already. I thought you cancelled the trip. -I shared my location with you. Sure, I trust you. I will send you our wedding invitation format. I just want a simple invitation. Sure. I'll update you again soon. I'm catching up with Fatma. -Okay, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Thank you. -You're welcome. So, I am going to get married soon. With Hendrik? No, with Iqbal. This is the guy. He's the one. He's my senior at the university. We got close when I was doing my thesis. He is a very nice person. He is so smart and wise. I am sure that he is the one. By the way, how is your thesis about modern society going? I have reached the extraction chapter. I am writing about the urban community... ...and community in rural areas. -Okay, good then. It's raining. Let's go there. -Let's go. It's raining heavily. Do you know that you are so similar with the rain? Similar? -I really miss it. That's so lame. -But it's real. Let me go home now. -It's still raining. You're being so annoying. -But that's a fact. Really? -Yes. I am here because I want to have a more serious relation with Atika. I want to propose to Atika. Before I give you an answer,... ...I need to know about your future plans. Marriage is a serious commitment. You need to consider it thoroughly. I am very sure of my decision. I am aware that I just graduated from the university. But I have sincere feelings for Atika. This is Atika's choice. Then, who is Hendrik? Hendrik. Hendrik is my father. You know that I never knew my father since I was a kid. Marriage is not a simple thing. What you need to think of... ...is the life after marriage. How do you want it to be? Have you told Iqbal about our situation? About your father? You will need a guardian for your marriage. What will people say if you don't have a guardian for your marriage. I can find him, Mom. I can try to find my father. It's not that simple. -You said he is in Holland. I can go there to find him. No one said that he's dead, right? You've never been there. And we don't have any relatives there. I can contact Fatma. You still remember her, right? A friend from my childhood. I can ask her to help me. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Mom. I also want to meet him in person. I've wanted a father figure since I was a child. What is wrong with that? Am I asking for too much? Atika, what's the matter? It's nothing, Mom. In the end, my mother allowed me to come here. What about your grandmother? You are her favourite. Grandma. Atika. -I'm going out of town for a bit. I have some assignments from the university. How long will you be gone? -Not that long. A few days maybe. Take care of yourself and always keep me informed. Yes, for sure. Fatma, please help me find my father. Sure, we will try to find him. The problem is I don't know which part of Holland he is staying. You have never heard from him? You have never searched his name on Google, Facebook or Instagram? I have checked all social media and Google, but... ...I couldn't find anything. I don't know where to start. My mom just gave me this ring,... ...a letter, a photo and this. This record belongs to my father's band group. He was the vocalist of the group. Okay, you are too tired now. Let's just rest for tonight. Then we'll start looking for him tomorrow, okay? Atika. I am very certain that we will find your father, okay? Amen. Thank you. I feel like the whole universe is supporting me this morning. The thousands of people that I saw in Amsterdam... ...seems to be accepting and encouraging of me... ...and of course Fatma too. I realize there are a lot of bad possibility... ...that can happen to me in this unknown country. But those thoughts were beaten by the feeling of fear. I fear if I don't start now,... ...the chances of me finding my father might change... ...from difficult to impossible. We have searched all over the city, but can't find any clues. It's okay. Let's continue tomorrow. We are freezing and tired, so let's just go home for now. Okay, let's go home. -All right. Let's go home, Atika. I am sure we'll find your father. Amen. -Amen. Do you still care for him? More than just care. If you are wondering,... ...if I am still in love with your father or not,... ...there's only one answer for that. I fell in love with him sincerely. At the time,..... At the time,... ...I didn't get the chance to tell him that I was pregnant. What happened the last 23 years... ...is no longer a problem. What matters is the future. And of course about your wedding plan. I hope your father still remembers this ring. This is the only picture I have left. And also this cassette. This is his band. Forgive me for bringing up your old pain. And I am making you feel sad again. Nothing can make me happy... ...other than your happiness. Go and find your paradise, child. If we can't find him here,... ...is it possible for us to try to find him outside of Amsterdam? There are a lot of cities with Dam at the end of it. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Volendam. I don't think we can go through them one by one. Yes, it's impossible. -We can, but it is not efficient. Hendrik De Jong. That is his full name. We have a lot of De Jong in Holland. So that won't make it easy to find him. My father's descendent is Indonesian and Dutch. My grandfather is a Dutch, and my grandmother is Indonesian. The problem is you don't have any clues about them. The only information that we have are... ...a cassette, a letter, and a photo. Atika, I have to be honest with you. If in the end we can't find him,... ...please don't be too upset about it. As long as we try first. Wait. I am sure there's a record when my father entered the country. Especially if he's living here. I am also thinking about that. This is the best way, let me call my friend in the embassy. Yes, that's right. -Alright. Let's go. Coincidentally, Mr. Slamet is in Amsterdam. So we don't need to go to the embassy in Den Haag. Thank goodness. We'll get down in Gaston. Good afternoon. How are you? -Afternoon, Mr. Slamet. Sorry I am a little bit late. Good afternoon, sir. So, what can I help with? We want to give you the documents. Here you go. All right. Fatma, what brought you here? No, sir. I have a different business. This is my friend from Indonesia, she's trying to find her father... ...whom she has not heard from in the last 20 years. Yes, his name is Hendrik De Jong. He entered Holland around 1997. If he chose to keep his Indonesia citizenship,... ...I am sure we will have the document. All right, maybe we can send some documents that we have... ...to your email, sir? -Sure, I will update you... ...when I'm back in the office tomorrow. Thank you so much. -No problem. By the way, the event we planned for next year is still happening. It's still happening? -Yes. What is the plan now? -Some kind of art show..... The merciful and loving, Allah... ...You've witnessed my present in another part of the world... ...just to find my father. The father figure I have never met, but is always longing for. Only Your guidance will lead my way. If he's still alive, please unite us. If he's already with You, embrace me to accept it. I'm surrendering everything to You. Can Mr. Slamet find the document and the address of my father? I am sure he can. Don't be pessimistic. It's only been a few days. All right? -Yes. You already prayed to God, right? God's willing, we'll find him. -Amen. Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. How are you? -I am fine. How are you there, Iqbal? -I am fine too. Why do you look so sad? I don't know, I feel..... I feel confused thinking what if I can't find him. You need to be patient and keep him in your prayers. I am sure you'll find a way. Amen. I got an email from Mr. Slamet. -Really? There's new information? -Yes. Hendrik went to them once... ...8 years ago to file a working permit. Do they have his picture? -No, but we have a number... ...and an address. -Thank goodness Let's try to call him. -Okay. Hello? The number is not available anymore. Let's just go to the address now. -Sure. Okay. I hope we get a new update from there. Alright, let me shower first. Yes, hello. Hello, is Hendrik De Jong living here? He no longer lives here. -Do you know where he lives now? No, I don't know. -Okay, sorry to bother you. How is it? He doesn't live here anymore, and they don't know where he lives. Where should we go now? Let's find a place to drink coffee, so we can have another clear idea. Besides a picture, you also have a cassette from him, right? Yes. I am curious about the songs. Where can we play that kind of cassette? It is a digital world now. It's hard to find a tape player. Atika. Wait here for a moment. Hello, may I ask you something? -Yes, sure. Do you know this band? -This band? Yes, I know this band from a long time ago. Do you know where can I get their information? This band? Yes. Someone near knows this band. Yes, I can give you the address. It's close from here, I can show you. From here, walk a few blocks there. Then this way, and you'll see this. Okay. -Yes. Thank you. -You're welcome. Good music. -Thank you. Your dad's letter sounds so sad. I can imagine how he felt when writing the letter. Yes. My mom said grandma did it for the good of my mother. Because she is the only daughter. And a musician got no regular income, right? Is this the place? -Yes. To have a musician son-in-law who has no fixed income... ...made grandma worried that he can't make my mother happy. But he was trying to find a better life for her by coming here. I am sure your father is deeply in love with your mother. That's why I really want to meet him. I think this is the place. -I think so too. Maybe this is the place. Sorry, sir. Do you know about The Dams? The Dams? Wait a minute, let me think. In the 90's they practiced here,... ...but in 2001 they disbanded and separated. They were never published. Luuk, found dead from an overdose in a cheap hotel in Paris. And Jan is working as a truck driver in Belgium. What did he say? You don't want to know. One of the members is dead. Oh my God. What about my father? What about the other band members? -The vocalist, he is more private. But Gerhard the drummer, he works at a convenience store nearby. Here, I have a photo of him. Who is this? -This is Gerhard, the drummer. He is working as a cleaner here. -Really? But he doesn't know where my father is? Let's try to go there. -Alright. Thank you, sir. -You're welcome. Good luck. Sorry, excuse me. -We're closed. We just want to ask you something. -Look, we're closed. Get Out! Okay, okay. Sorry. Gerhard. How do you know my name? You know about the band The Dams? Hendrik is her father. You can find him in this neighbourhood. Thank you. Thank you. -You're welcome. What's wrong? The area he gave us is a bit scary. Especially if you are wearing a hijab. And this is a bar area, we can only go there at night. That's okay. That's the only way, right? Hello? Atika, someone is looking for you. -Peace be upon you. Oh my God. Peace be upon you too. Iqbal, how can you..... How can you find this place? How do you know the address? You shared your location before. -Really? Why didn't you tell me before? I forget to introduce you to the house owner. This is Fatma. -I'm the one who invited him in. I already introduced myself. Don't be that nervous. How is it going? Have you found your father? Not yet. But we got an address that we need to visit tonight. Hopefully we find him. What do you want to drink? Make some drinks for him. I know you are too tired. Let's sit over here. Are you okay to sleep on the couch? -Sure, no problem. Iqbal's presence won't help me find my father faster. But at least, he will look after me and keep my spirit up. Are you sure you want to go here? -We don't have a choice, right? That's the only lead we got. -It's okay. I am here too. Thank you. Just stay calm. We need to be optimistic. We will find your father. Yes, we have to go to those places, but I am here to protect you. Thank you, Iqbal. We have come to this place with a strong will,... ...so we should not give up. But since we need to go to those places,... ...we need to be extra cautious and keep our safety as a priority. Let's go home and rest for now. We will continue tomorrow. Hey, beautiful. -Hey, let her go. Don't touch me. -Iqbal, let's go! Sorry. Hello, beautiful. -Hey, don't bother her! Hey, get off! -Stop! Iqbal! Wait a second. -What? Sorry sir, excuse me. -Yes. Do you know Hendrik De Jong? -No. You're at the wrong place, lady. Would you like something to drink? No, thanks. -No? Get Out! I told you. Let's go find him in another place. Let's go to another place. Forget it, Iqbal. Let's just go. We want more, we want more. We should not have entered that place. We don't have a choice, Fatma. Iqbal, we are strangers here. Try not to get into trouble. Sorry, I got carried away. I don't want them to touch either one of you. Thank you, Iqbal. -Thank you. But we do need to be more cautious. -Yes. Cigarettes, give me cigarettes. Give me your cigarettes. -I don't have any. We don't have any! -Give me your cigarettes! Don't touch me! I don't have any! -Where're your cigarettes? Give me! We don't have any cigarettes! -I need a cigarette. Hey! Are you crazy? Are you okay? -Yes. Everything okay? -You're okay, right? Where are you from? -Indonesia. Oh, from Bali. Listen, my bar is nearby. Let me give you guys some drinks and you can calm down there. It's nearby. Its okay, don't worry, I'm good. This is Amsterdam. Many people ask for cigarettes. Don't worry about that. He asked for cigarettes right? -Yes. Don't worry about that. This way, it's just nearby. You don't drink alcohol right? This is safe. Thank you. -You're welcome. That's the guy from before. Why is he following us? Let's just get out of here now. -Let's go. What happened? Come on, Iqbal. Why is he following us? Are you sure he's following us? -Not really. It looks like he is. Let's just hope we get home safely tonight. Hey, hey, hey. Those are the people from earlier. Wait, wait. Who's that guy? Hey! Get out! Get out! Okay, relax. -Okay. We'll go from here. Let's go, let's go. You have to leave this place. Come on, let's go. Come on, Tika. Please come, sit down. You're safe here. I have to go now. You guys wait here until the situation gets better. Thank you. Johan, who is that? Why does he sell cigarettes? I don't know his real name, but I call him, Mr. Cigar. Mr. Cigar? Yes, because he always sells cigarettes around here. Here in the Netherlands, it's actually illegal. That's why he always wears a hoodie to be more undercover. By the way,... ...have you ever heard of this band? The Dams? Are they from here? -Yes. I'm looking for my father. He's Indonesian. He used to be in this band. His name is Hendrik De Jong. I see. We need to find another way. Maybe this way of searching is not effective. I agree with you, but what other way is there? My father was a member of that band. The only information we got led us to that kind of place. Let's just try it again. Okay? All right. Let's try to go there again tomorrow. I am proud to have a wife to be who is as strong as you are. There are not a lot of woman as strong as you. You know that I really want to see my father. It has been 23 years and I've never known who my father is. I also really want..... I really want my father to walk me down the aisle at my wedding. Let's work this out together, okay? I'm confident your dream will come true. Amen. I think we should talk to the guy who was selling cigarettes. Okay, sure. -You guys agree? Guys, maybe I have some good news for you. I have a friend and he is a music journalist. His name is Jarwo and he is also Indonesian like you. Maybe he can help you to find information about The Dams. Can we meet him? -Sure, I can arrange a meeting. How about Mr. Cigar? Do you know him? To be honest, I don't know much about him. Sorry, I can't help you with that. But I can arrange a meeting with Jarwo. You can ask him anything about The Dams. That's something, right? -Yes. Okay, maybe once you've set up a meeting with him... ...you could call me? Should we exchange numbers? Yes, that would be handy. -Yes? Just give me your phone, I'll give you my number. Here you go. -Hold on. Iqbal seems to be the right man for you. I hope so. Since the beginning, I already feel right with him. Hurry up and get ready. I'll wait downstairs and we'll have breakfast. Yes. Iqbal already made breakfast for us. That is so sweet. I'm coming now. Hold on for me, Mom. Mom, we're almost arriving at the hospital. Doctor, how is my mother? -Please stay calm. We are doing the best we can. Keep praying for the best. Sorry, I have to excuse myself. Why didn't she pick up the phone? Hey, guys. -Hey. This is my friend Jarwo that I was telling you about. Jarwo, this is Iqbal. -Hello, I am Iqbal. I am Jarwo. Fatma. -Jarwo. I need to make a phone call. You can ask anything about The Dams to Jarwo. Okay? See you. Jarwo, what do you know about Hendrik from The Dams? Hendrik? Vocalist of The Dams. I know him very well. But we are busy with our own thing. Hendrik was busy with The Dams and I was busy with my thing. So, how long have you not seen Hendrik The Dams? The last time I saw him was 8 years ago. Since he suffered from a burnt injury. A very serious injury. -Burnt injury? He disappeared after he got that injury. But do you know where he is right now? Or do you know where he lives? I think I kept his number in my phone before. Let me look for it. Hold on. Where is Atika? I told her what happened. As soon as she finish her thesis, she will come back. It's okay. I already know everything. I am sorry, Mom. I have lied to you. I'm the one who should apologize to you. Mom. What did you say to Hendrik? Why did he leave and left this letter to me? What do you mean? -Hendrik left me, Mom. It's good that he's gone. How can you say that? Ratih, you can have a better man than Hendrik. But I only love Hendrik, Mom. Forget about him. I have been harsh to the both of you. I should have understood you better. I realize how much you love him now. Johan, come here. -Yes. This is Hendrik's address. Do you know where this is? Yes, it's not far from here. -Are you sure? Hey, I know this address. It's actually not far from here. I can take you there. -Really? Yes. -Sure. But sorry I can't join you guys, I have another appointment today. It's okay, Jarwo. -I hope you will find him soon. Thank you, Jarwo. -Thank you so much. Are you sure this is the place? -Yes. Take a look first. If it was not because of me,... ...maybe you two would live happily. It's okay, Mom. I made you wait in an uneasy situation... ...for more than 20 years. Atika went so far to find Hendrik, all by herself. Just to find her guardian for her wedding. Mr. Hendrik? Iqbal? It seems he's not here. I will try to check it again. If I was given another chance... ...to turn back the time,... ...I wish to be back at the time before Hendrik left. Mom. Please forgive me, Ratih. I am so sorry. Mom. Dad. Oh my God, this is really my father. This is really my father's house. This is really my father's house. That is Mr. Cigar, right? Peace be upon you, Mom. Peace be upon you, Mom -Peace be upon you too, Atika. Grandma. I am so sorry, Grandma. Hendrik. Atika asked me to give this to you. I'm sure she's your child, Hendrik. You have to go there. I can't. She came from Indonesia just to look for you. And she just asked you to come to her wedding, that's all. After all that has happened in the past,... ...you can fix it all by going to her wedding. Come on. After all that has happened..... Hey, you must take responsibility. Grandma. Grandma. Please wake up, Grandma. With this I am marrying... ...Hendrik Bin Franc De Jong... ...with Ratih Binti Ahmad Yusuf Jainuri... ...with a mahar of 2 grams of gold ring... ...and a set of praying equipment in cash. I accept the marriage of your daughter... ...Ratih binti Ahmad Yusuf Jainuri... ...with the agreed mahar in cash. Praise to God. Ratih, the light of my paradise,... ...I am lost for words to describe how much I love you. I don't want to make things more complicated. Plus, it seems that I always make your mother feel irritated. I am trying to find my own way out. Wish me all the best in the path I choose. When I find a new hope or a new way,... ...I will come home to find you. Love, Hendrik. Hendrik left me, Mom. -Very well then. How can you say that? -I don't approve of him. Please forgive me, Grandma. Grandma? I am also... Grandma? Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! Mom! Mom. We belong to Allah, and to Allah we return. Grandma. Atika, my condolences to you. You must stay strong. -Thank you. Please excuse us. -We will go now. Atika, our deepest condolences. Stay strong, okay? May she rest in peace. Daddy? Hendrik? Mom already forgave you, Hendrik. "Three months later" This struggle made me realize... ...that every sincerity, prayer, and hard work... ...will bring us to something bigger. As the paradise that I am longing for. I accept the marriage of your daughter,... ...Atika Purnamasari Binti Hendrik De Jong... ...with the mahar agreed upon in cash. All agreed. Praise to God. Now you can put the ring on each other's fingers. Praise to God. As we end the wedding ceremony, let's hear the ustaz's advise. When are you going to marry? Pray that I will find someone like Atika. As single as you are, you will find the end of the story. What ending is it, Ustaz? If not a wedding, it's a funeral. Marriage is simple. You and me equals us. There's no reason not to marry. The Prophet Muhammad was saying... ...there will be no marriage... ...without any true guardian and witness. We have both a guardian and two witnesses. Your marriage is rightful by law and religion. Praise to God. A true love sometimes can't be united. True love can be separated miles away. But one thing for sure,... ...a true love will never change. "He has placed between you compassion and mercy." "Surely in this are signs for people who reflect." "Surah Ar-Rum 21."
