Joon-su! Dammit! Seriously?! You’re out, trash! Get the hell out. Mine! - Nice! - Awesome! Nice! Good, here we go! Nice shot, sir! Attention! This is HR officer Lt. Lim So-yeon, she’ll be with us for a month. Lt. Lim, could you kick us the ball? Over here! Kick it here! - Nice! - Mine! Take this! THE RECON Capt. Kang Sung-gu She’s up at this hour? Look who it is! I was actually thinking of giving you a call. Where are you stationed at? Captain, I need to consult you on something. Yeah? What is it? Go on. The thing is... - I’ll call you right back. - Captain! I don’t believe this! They could fetch it themselves... Little punks... What’s that? Please don’t do this! I’m so doomed... Time went by quickly, it’s been a year already. Young-sik should be doing okay? Lt. Lim came by earlier. She’s being tricky. One-on-one interview’s enough. Even if we enlisted together... Sgt. Yoo, I think I should... Hang in there. She’ll be gone after the upcoming tactical training. Sgt. Yoo! Holy crap! I just witnessed something as spectacle as a tsunami! Get lost and pass out. There’s no time for that. Man, I watched it happen with my eyeballs... Watched what? Lt. Col. Baek was like a wild stallion. He took Lt. Lim from behind, and he was like... I think it came from here... Training Officer Lt. Lim So-yeon Lt. Lim! - I’ll take care of it. - Yes, sir. - Dismissed. - Salute. Salute! Did I disturb your sleep? I was going over tomorrow’s training program. May I ask what this is about? Have you heard? Truth Commission on Deaths in the Military, it’ll likely be resurrected this year. - Defense Ministry’s inves... - I guess... they were uncomfortable resolving the issue. Since the media’s up in arms, they want another go. No need to worry. That incident wasn’t your fault. If you’re so worried, you could destroy all records. Do you know... why Jesus was nailed to the cross? He tried to save every single lamb. That’s why people say he’s great. But I’ll gladly sacrifice that lamb. I have a mission for you. What’s dope about it is, Lt. Lim turned back like this... Hey, hey! Are you messing with us? Corp. Park, as a future career soldier, do I look like someone who’d lie about this? I’m serious, Lt. Colonel grabbed her hair, pulled down her pants. - And from behind like this... - Song, re-enact it for us. Stop eating that. - Song, re-enact! - Yeah! Legs apart more! In this position, he grabbed her hair! - I love it... - Yeah? - Faster! - Faster? - You bastard. - She just took it. What are you doing? That’s the emergency siren! Where are you going?! Hurry! Go! A deserter was reported at guard post 307! He shot a senior soldier and ran into the DMZ. Your mission is to search the DMZ and arrest the deserter. You are allowed to open fire as per rules of engagement, but do not engage the North Koreans. What the hell are you doing?! Salute! Salute. It looks to be a suicide, sir. Anything else? Nothing out of ordinary, no suicide note either. - Report it. - Yes, sir. Division HQ Amazing. Capt. Kang! You said you’d be done by 4! Sgt. Kim, come here. I’m developing this for my diner menu, it’s... Forget it, you always make me eat weird crap... I went too easy on you! Get over here! Could you not drink booze in the kitchen? Here, taste it. How is it? So hot! What a mess! Who’d pay for this? Buddy, this is incredible! What are you talking about? It’s so delicious. Salute! Sir, could you critique this? I made it... with dried radish greens, it’s incredible. Get ready, we got a suicide. I’m off duty today. I got a startup meeting at 3, and I gotta meet with real estate agent... Come out in 5. But there’s Lt. Han and Master Sgt. Yoo too... Sir! Come on... Idiot! There, there! Wait in ambush with Corp. Jang. Yes, sir. - Come with me. - Pardon? Take the lead. Pardon? Me, sir? Take the lead! Lt. Cho? - Is this the right way? - It is. Lt. Cho... I think I stepped on a mine. Wait, wait, wait! Lt. Cho, what are you doing? Who’s there?! It’s me, Joon-su, Pvt. Kim Joon-su, sir! I’ll shoot if you move! Please don’t shoot me! I won’t move at all! I’ve never seen a goddamn moron like you! Damn! Stupid moron! 1 year ago A soldier lost a magazine? You call yourself a soldier, moron?! Yo, Seoul U. What’s the use of your brain, when you’re useless? I’m sorry, sir. I had it a moment ago... Shut the hell up! Min, you stupid bastard. Do magazines have legs, then? What will you tell them when you return?! You dodged? Christ, are you out of your goddamn mind? Hello? Is anyone there? Crap... Dear Lord in heaven... Darn it, Sgt. Yoo! Corp. Park! Salute! Salute! It’s been a while. How’s your father? Still well? He’s busy with expansion of the Bundang Army Hospital. And you, sir? Everything’s the same here. I haven’t seen him before. He transferred 7 months ago. He’s discharging next month. Capt. Kang Sung-gu, sir. My apologies, I’m in a bit of rush... Bloodstain direction, gunpowder scent, no other external wounds... we’ll have to do an autopsy, but it looks to be a suicide. Done already? Do you even know how long you were in there? I’m sorry, sir. Get the photos and submit a report. One second, sir... You know I got the startup meeting later. So write it quickly. I got a meeting too. I will, sir. Stairs here are steep, be careful. She came all the way here only to die... Take it easy, you bastards. I’m sorry. Lim So-yeon Is anyone there? That sounds like Joon-su. Park and Song, follow, you two, standby. First time in the DMZ? I came here once as a private. Did you know this place is a mass grave? I didn’t, sir. When you dig a hole here, you’ll find bodies. Americans, us too, when something happens, bodies get buried and covered up. Demilitarized Zone? Screw that. This place is filled with resentful souls, a Soul Zone. They buried mines to hide those facts. Hey! And we’re smack in the middle. Please help me! Over there! - Is anyone there?! - Hey, Pvt. Kim! Sgt. 1st Class Bae! I’m saved! What are you doing? I stepped on a mine! Don’t move a muscle. Be careful, sir! We’re in a minefield! I said don’t move, you brat! Be careful! Lt. Cho was going to kill me. I’m serious! He was... Shut the hell up and don’t move, moron! He really tried to kill me! Look at this! He brought me here to kill me! That must be it. It’s because I witnessed the rape, so to hide... - She’s dead. - Pardon? Who do you mean? Lt. Lim committed suicide early this morning. Damn, that’s why I was sent... Deserter spotted! Cease fire, you bastards! The deserter shot first. Following the rules of engagement... What?! Is it true? Were you trying to kill Joon-su? What are you talking about? Tell us! It’s because he witnessed Lt. Col. Baek’s rape! You son of a...! What the hell do you know?! Are you out of your mind?! Eat trash! Son of a...! What are you doing?! Let me go, bastard! Fess up! Fess up, bastards! Who’s got the balls to yap away?! Was it you? Was it? What are you doing, are you nuts?! Park, put the gun down. Put that down! Lt. Cho! Put it down, dumbhead! Lt. Cho! The Dreyfus Affair. In 1894, French officer Dreyfus was convicted of treason for allegedly being a German spy. It took 100 years before the army accepted their mistake. Min-seob? How are you? If you leave now, you’ll fail this program. Okay. This case sets a precedent, that when those who fight for truth and justice don’t give up, the truth will always be revealed in the end. Aren’t you taking it too seriously? You were like that when you were my boss. Me? You were legendary for your seriousness. You got the boot for digging into military corruption too. That’s why you should take it easy. ‘Truth will be revealed’ is only in a textbook... You don’t remember? That’s what you said. Army Note Lt. Lim So-yeon HR Priorities 1. New Recruit Credibility Test... Protest to Investigate Mysterious Army Death - Min Young-sik, could not adjust? - Real testimony exists? Min Young-sik? Army sentences 4 for murder over death of Pvt. Yoon “The Dreyfus Affair. Truth will be revealed,” Capt. Kang Sung-gu Because of her likable personality, she got along with everyone. Everyone went to consult her, saying they were depressed. Was she acting weird yesterday? She looked a bit tired, but this is ATT period. I feel bad for her. Do you know... someone named Min Young-sik? - Min Young-sik? - Yes. He committed suicide in the 3rd platoon. Suicide? He shot himself on his first DMZ training. Why do you ask? It’s nothing, just curious. She had no motives to kill herself. She adjusted well to the army life. If you dig for motives, you’ll constantly find more. But even so... Don’t you have a meeting? Send the report. Did you know a private named Min Young-sik? It looked like Lt. Lim was reinvestigating his case. Are you implying that this case is somehow related to that? She didn’t have a reason to kill herself. So, have you found anything? No, sir. If a hunch is all you got, get back to me when you find something solid. I was taught that all cases start with a hunch. Christ... Have you ever stationed at the DMZ? No, sir. This is the spearhead of the frontline. You can never show your weakness. You'll be discharged soon? Dismissed, Capt. Kang. Lt. Han, do me a favor. Could you send me Pvt. Min’s suicide case files, and Lt. Lim So-yeon’s too, ASAP. What happened? What the hell happened?! Lt. Cho apparently cut the comm cord... What do you mean? Lt. Lim So-yeon committed suicide. What? It’s because of Lt. Col. Baek’s sexual assault. Joon-su witnessed it, so he ordered Lt. Cho to kill him. Are you all right? Damn it... What happened? Where’s that bastard Park Kyung-su? Joon-su and Sgt. 1st Class Bae are dead. Did Lt. Col. Baek... Where the hell did he go? Bunch of craps... Where did that moron go? That way, sir! Who's there?! Hands up! I'll shoot if you move! The deserter? Who are you? Come on out! Come out here, bastard! It's a suicide! Why do you think so? I think he wanted to screw us. It's a suicide for sure! Why are you doing this?! Get your hands off of me. Our men are dead. This isn't the time nor place! Do-cheol! Hey! Moron! Are you out of your goddamn mind?! There's something... Where’s what, thickhead?! Someone's here, there's someone here! Cease fire! Cease fire! Kyung-su! Park Kyung-su! Goddammit, who was it?! He was shot from behind. Someone shot him from the back. What’s with you all? Why’re you looking at me? It wasn’t me! Crap, you’re at it again? Just like when you killed Young-sik? You killed Kyung-su. No, I didn’t sense it at all. How did Lt. Lim look yesterday? She felt the same as always. She was close to the 3rd platoon. She had a counseling session with Corp. Jang yesterday. Around what time? After 5? They sounded serious. 3rd platoon Orderly? Salute. Is the 3rd platoon on duty? They were sent on a mission to DMZ to find a deserter. They haven't returned? That's right, sir. Salute. Stormy 3rd Platoon, We Are One! 1st Company, 3rd Platoon Register Yoo Sang-tae. Han Min-seok. Park Kyung-su. Jang Sung-ho. These are the 3rd platoon files you requested. I see. - Capt. Lee? - Yes? How did Lt. Lim transfer here? There wasn’t a program for her. I heard she got an approval from Defense Ministry herself. Is that right? Okay. Sgt. Ko Tae-seok Pvt. Min Young-sik Friend: Jang Sung-ho - Enlisted together - Death – 1.13.2016 Sgt. Park Il-su Hello, I’m Il-su’s predecessor Kang Sung-gu. Did he... It’s enough already! I talked to the lady lieutenant! My boy killed himself! Capt. Lee Presumably Murdered - Ko Dae-seok / Park Il-su - Platoon knew anything? Platoon knew anything? Consult Counselor Kim Ji-hyun I don’t know. So stop coming by! Park Il-su - Min Young-sik, could not adjust? - Real testimony exists? Lt. Han: I emailed you Min Young-sik files You piece of trash! How dare you! I’ll beat you up! What are you all doing? Hold him back! You trash! What did you just say? Did I say something wrong? Young-sik died because of you! That case ended as a suicide! It’s a closed case! Did you know today is his death anniversary? You killed them all! I said it wasn’t me! If not! Then why did you take Joon-su into the minefield? What the hell’s going on? Then... are we next? Who is that? Who are you?! Damn it... We’re running again? Wait for me! Lt. Cho! Sung-ho! Crap... Where the hell did everyone go? Holy crap! I don’t think I should... Do it, douchebag. Buddy. Don’t get involved. Friend or not, you gotta cover your butt first. But this is... I hate guys who get in my face. 2nd Lt. Cho is perfect for grilling guys like them. No? A soldier lost a magazine? You call yourself a soldier, moron?! Shut the hell up! You stupid bastard. Do magazines have legs, then? Christ, are you out of your goddamn mind? Young-sik... Is this your doing? Did you toss his magazine?! It wasn’t me! I had no choice! Sgt. Park ordered me to do it! Sgt. Han? Sgt. Song! Sgt. Han! What happened? We were supposed to go on vacation together. Who was it? Who did this to him?! It’s the deserter. That bastard killed him! No, there never was a deserter. Min Young-sik Shot in neck and shoulder, died instantly on the scene. Parents refuted the suicide, and requested a reinvestigation. Testimony: Cho Sung-hoon Bang, bang, I heard 2 shots. Pvt. Min, who was on the suicide watchlist, went missing during our ambush training at 1600 hours. I heard a gunshot then. My platoon ran to the sound, and found Min with gunshot wounds on his neck and chest. I called it a suicide, and reported to the base, and followed the battalion commander’s orders. This makes sense? How did they put Min on the suicide watchlist? Lt. Cho’s testimony doesn’t make sense! How could he shoot himself twice while killing himself?! We were told that it was a burst fire. Right? Yes, that’s correct. - Clean that up. - Yes, sir. You can’t barge in here! Where's the commander? He went to inspect the training facility. Please leave. I got an earful from him early in the morning. Why? Lt. Lim came here yesterday. He found out and went berserk, please get out at once. Why was she here? I said I’d shine her boots and she took up my offer. She was going in and out of here, then ran off. She left her boots like Cinderella. Jeez... Wait... What are you doing? Lt. Lim did not commit suicide. Kang Sung-gu. I’m absolutely sure. I’m gonna find out the real cause... You can champion that after the autopsy. I bet. You already determined it a suicide before arriving here. What? If not, why did you bring me here? What happened to you? As a Military Academy grad, you’re discharging as a captain. Your future was set 7 years ago, when you cried corruption of a brigade commander. I don’t regret that decision. You got a startup meeting. Fine. Do whatever you want. If it wasn’t the deserter or you, then who was it? It can’t be, it has to be the deserter. I saw him too. The deserter mission area isn’t here. Corp. Park said someone was here. The man I saw was Min Young-sik. Does that make sense? He died last year. You’re putting the blame on him again? You pushed it as a suicide. Lieutenant, your knife... Then the one who stabbed Sgt. Han... It wasn’t me! Where’s your knife then? We’ll return to base. Once we’re back, I’ll expose everything. No one can leave before we find out who killed them. You did. It wasn’t me. I didn’t do it! If you want to stay, be my guest. Lieutenant! It was! A suicide! Min is already dead! We must stop additional sacrifices! What did these men do wrong? They all deserve, to go home, no? For that reason, your testimony is excellent. But as your superior, I have to know what really happened. Write it again. The real one. No need to be nervous. This version... is the one I’ll be submitting. Lieutenant, I’m really curious. Did you really kill Pvt. Kim and Corp. Park? With Han like that, I’m so lost! I really believe you, but what I don’t get is... - Song! - Yes, sir? What the hell! Sgt. Yoo! Sgt. Yoo! Lt. Cho, you bastard! I got vacation next week... Sgt. Yoo, are you okay? That piece of crap, he wants to kill us all. Damn it! Sung-ho! What do we do? Go back and tell the truth. Where is it? The deserter is found! - Current location? - We’re verifying that. Where’s 3rd platoon? They should’ve been back, but not yet, sir. What?! Tiger, Tiger, this is Eagle, over. Tiger, come in, this is Eagle, over. Try again. They went dark since the morning. Tiger, come in, this is Eagle, over. No other comms? Let’s see... At 10:12, guard post 307 reported gunshots from the DMZ. - Was this reported? - Yes, sir. The battalion commander told me to just monitor it. What? - Capt. Kang! - Get lost! Captain, you can’t go in there... What was the objective of this mission? The deserter was reported at 17:32 last night. Why were they deployed early in the morning? I’m the one in charge of all missions in the DMZ. Min Young-sik died a year ago today. I’m sure you know that Lt. Cho’s report was a complete fabrication. Lt. Lim was reinvestigating that incident, and she probably found the real testimony. From right here. You found that out and went to her dorm. And there... You bastard... A murder could’ve taken place. You bastard, say that one more time. What was the real purpose of this mission? Kang Sung-gu. 3rd platoon is back! But just 1 man. Run! Dumbhead, get in! Salute! What happened? Where are others? Go outside. I need to hear what happened. Everyone out! Take him outside! I’m the investigator! I have the right to listen! What happened? I asked you a question, soldier! We were chasing the deserter... We split up... and a mine went off... and there was a skirmish... I collapsed... and the firefight... Then Lt. Cho... I don’t know... I can’t remember... 3rd platoon? They haven’t returned, sir. Don’t let anyone in before they return. Yes, sir! Salute! Startup Support: Please attend the meeting by 3 PM today. Dammit... I heard you’re discharging soon. 20 days left. You should wrap it up when the platoon returns. That’s how it is here. If you’re not going to go all the way, don’t bother. Is that how Min’s case got shelved a year ago? Salute! Get it together! Get off! What’s wrong? Out! Out! What happened?! 1 injured, rest are all dead. The survivor? Sgt. Yoo is in a bad shape, he’s been admitted. Salute! You really can’t go in there, you could get me killed! What happened? What went down in there? Jang Sung-ho! Everyone went mad... Lt. Col. Baek’s rape... That was the start of it all. This mission was deployed to kill Pvt. Kim, the witness of the rape... Lt. Cho intended to disguise the incident as a mine accident. But Sgt. Bae got killed... and everything went to trash. When we became suspicious, Lt. Cho killed everyone. He tried to make it look like it was the deserter. Sgt. Yoo and I were the last ones left... and I shot Lt. Cho in the firefight... What about Sgt. Yoo? He was shot by the deserter. I ran like hell... Do you have anything else to hide? You have nothing to say in front of your dead men? Why did you kill Lt. Lim? Because of the testimony? Or the rape? That... was an accident. Lt. Lim So-yeon Open this door! What’s going on? Where is the testimony? I don’t know what you mean. I asked you where it is. I’ll be requesting a formal reinvestigation of Pvt. Min. Give it back. If it’s true, we must follow laws and protocols... What the hell do you know about DMZ?! Where is it?! Tell me! Where is it?! - Tell me! - Please don’t do this! Please leave! If you don’t, I’ll report everything. Lt. Lim, what you see isn’t everything. But you still can’t hide the truth! We’re in a wartime situation, I decide the truth! So you covered it up as a suicide? Where is the testimony? So many men... are dead because of it. Had the truth come out about Min’s death, Korea would’ve lost a good officer. And lives of my men would’ve been in ruins. Do you think... that exonerates your actions? The living... must go on living. Stop your bullcrap! In the end, it was for your own survival. In the DMZ! One can’t achieve the best outcome. If you want to arrest me, follow the procedure. Yes, Lt. Col. Baek confessed. Corp. Jang will back it up. Yes, I understand. Capt. Kang! It’s the deserter file you asked for. Thank you. - Sgt. Hwang? - Yes, sir? Is the body location correct? It’s not the 3rd platoon’s mission area. That was sent from the division. He was shot by the deserter. I ran like hell... Sgt. Yoo Sang-tae Salute. Capt. Kang, you really can’t, I’m begging you. Capt. Kang! I don’t believe it! Corp. Jang Sung-ho Hey, you two are enlisting together, what’s there to be afraid of? Am I right? Right? Sung-ho, it’s less than 2 years, let’s go all the way. It’ll go quick, right? It’ll be over in a blink. Probably, right? Of course! I’ll visit often, just to see Young-sik! You punks! Break up. 2 years is long enough. I’ll introduce you to a cute older gal... Trainee Jang Sung-ho! You need a good beating, come here... Hey, hey! Let’s take one last selfie as civilians. - Yeah? - Sure! Here we go, one, two! The real testimony you mentioned... I found it. This is why you didn’t tell me? Sung-ho. You should’ve said so... You’re a friend... Just verify that this is correct. The position’s all wrong. This angle isn’t easy to pull off. - I love it... - Yeah? You like it? You... killed us all. I don’t regret my decision. Then and even now. Jang Sung-ho! You came to seek revenge? Lim So-yeon and Min Young-sik... You came to avenge them? The deserter was never at the 3rd platoon’s mission area. Who shot Sgt. Yoo? What happened to the 3rd platoon? It was me. I killed those who deserved to die. Why? For what?! Everything started, on the day Young-sik died. What happened that day? Young-sik... was killed by us all. What? Why is that important now? I’m still... alive like this? No! No! God no! 10 days later Ministry of Defense, Investigation HQ End the investigation? What’s going on? It’s from the top. Nothing’s been confirmed! If it ends like this... Will you get it together?! 8 men from a platoon died. We have to find out how they died! What will you do with that? Have you thought about who’d want this? Rather than meaningless deaths, it could be honorable, so their family could be compensated, are you really that thick?! Even so! They’ll want to know the truth. It’s already settled with the rep of their families. Dammit! What about Min Young-sik? And Lt. Lim?! They all committed suicide! Buddy! Capt. Kang Sung-gu. Don’t even bring them up. Go away. Sir. Please wait until Sgt. Yoo wakes up. You think he’ll spill everything like you imagine it? You think he’ll say Corp. Jang shot them all? Get discharged without an incident. You got 10 days left. Yeah, hey. What? Wasn’t it in 2 days? Damn... Lt. Lim So-yeon, who suffered serious depression, committed suicide when she couldn’t adjust to the army life. Early morning that day in the guard post 307 area, a mission to capture a deserter was carried out. It resulted in a skirmish with North Korea, and 8 of our men died, with 1 injured. North Korean army also suffered damages, and Lt. Col. Baek Young-cheol was overwhelmed with responsibility and took his own life. The army is deeply saddened by loss of a great leader and men, and as per violation of Armistice Agreement... Stop this nonsense, douchebag! This press briefing is a sham! It’s all a lie! Pull him out! North Korea was not involved! Pvt. Min Young-sik, Lt. Lim So-yeon, and all men of 3rd platoon, deserve reinvestigation! Pull him out! North Korea did not do this! If not, then who is behind it? Who is Pvt. Min Young-sik? What’s a lie? Let go of me! Do you have any evidence? Are they hiding something? A survivor of this incident exists! Who’s the survivor?! - Is this true? - Who is it? He’s right. There is a survivor. Who’s the survivor? Who is it? He’s here. It’s the survivor! State your name and rank. 2019 Recon, 3rd platoon, Sgt. Yoo Sang-tae. Sgt. Yoo, could you tell us what happened that day? Will you turn Corp. Jang into a murderer? Think about what their families need the most right now. Sang-tae. Don’t you want to go home? On January 13 at 04:07, the 3rd platoon entered the DMZ to arrest a deserter in the guard post 307 area. But due to unprovoked North Korean gunshots, my men were shot, and a firefight broke out... One by one... they began to die. And I... fled the area with Corp. Jang, and managed to survive... and returned to the base alone. That will be all for now. As you can see, he needs to rest. Do you have anything else to say? How did you survive? Did North Korea start this? What’s going on? Do you want to say something else? Tell us! We’re all behind this incident! Yoo Sang-tae... We... caused this incident! Go on, get him out! What are you doing?! He wants to say more! Let him talk! Sgt. Yoo! We caused this! Let go of me! What did you do to him! What did you do?! Quiet down please, we’ll continue with the briefing. Once the survivor stabilizes, we will schedule... Sgt. Yoo! Sgt. Yoo! Yoo Sang-tae! Yoo Sang-tae! What are you doing? Sgt. Yoo Sang-tae, I’m so sorry. Wait, did you... You know there’s something I should’ve done a long time ago. Sung-ho, but this is... I’m sorry. I still have something left to finish. We won’t have ramen together anymore. I saved up so many of them. - We are one! - I’m going home! Lt. Lim So-yeon... I’m sorry. As the cold air swoops in, atmosphere circulation will improve, and micro dust index will drop. With clearer field of vision, you’ll see blue sky... Yoo Sang-tae. Congrats on your discharge. We’ve met once before, do you remember? That day... what were you trying to say? It’s all in the past. Not yet. Because I haven’t given up. Didn’t you discharge? Why are you going this far? It’s embarrassing. You pretend not to know even though you do. Presidential Truth Commission on Deaths in the Military Someone said once, truth will always be revealed in the end. Do you think Lt. Lim also thought that way? Lim, Min and Jang, did you know they were friends? This is a testimony written by Lt. Cho. How did you... Testimony: Cho Sung-hoon I propped him against a tree and made it look like a suicide. Sgt. Yoo! If this is true, Jang had his revenge, why did he need to kill everyone? The three of them... should be together by now? Please no! Sgt. Park, this is wrong! Do you want to get blasted?! This is still not right! Will you be happy when we’re all in jail?! Get your mind together! Lt. Cho! You can’t do this, sir. Lieutenant! Please don’t do this... Lt. Cho! Min Young-sik Here, you do it. Why are you asking me? I gave you an order, moron! Hey, bring that bastard over. You do it! Pardon? You enlisted together. This is how we all get to live. I can’t do it! Take this. He’s already dead. Hold it, bastard! I can’t! Please! Sung-ho... Don’t forget, we’re all accomplices. We must take this to our graves. You all got that?! Yes, sir! Hey, hey! Pvt. Min Young-sik! Stop zoning out, okay? Young-sik! I told you to grabs the ball! Get over here, let’s take the pic! Smile, guys! Show me your teeth! Move aside, brat! He said move! Do I need to tell you? How else would I know?! New recruits, you two smile for real. Yes, sir! Stormy 3rd platoon! - We are! - One! THE RECON
