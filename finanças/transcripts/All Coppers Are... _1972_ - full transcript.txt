Nobody talks to him, see. -21,21. - You don't play the winner. - 21, alright. He had to have a go, didn't he? - Of course he did. - Yeah, well, he had to.

There's a possible cigarette raid on, they've no idea where as usual. - Huh, typical. - Snout's information, but you never know. There might be something in it. - If they knew any more about it, sir, they wouldn't be telling us, they'd be doing it themselves. - Probably.

Oh, alright, sorry I spoke, I'm sure. - Still doing this all on your tod, don't want no help? - Thanks all the same, Mr. - Wade, but I've worked this out on my own and I don't need nobody else. He is brave, isn't he? - Look, Mr. Wade, I know what I'm on. - All the same, you fancy yourself a bit, don't you? - All I'm looking for, Mr. Wade is a buyer. Look, I mean, you said- - you just deliver the goods, then you get your money, right? - Yeah, you drive the lorry straight in the yard. - Right. Well, like I said, Mr. Wade, it'll be there. - Yeah, so will your money in dirty fivers. You got a car to carry it all away then, have you? You drive a lorry straight in the garage, your money will be there, then you're off out of it, aren't you? And don't worry, I may not like you, but I won't double you. - I know that, Mr. Wade, I know that. I mean, that's why I come to you. - You come to me, 'cause you ain't got the brain to move the stuff yourself, that's why you come to me. Now don't give me a load of toffee, son. I've had it from the best, not rubbish like you. - Ta'ra then. - Come on. - I haven't finished my drink. Come on. - Oh, he's straight too. What a waste. Suit yourself. You don't make it easy, do you? You say you're gonna take me out, then you leave me sitting on my own, you don't even let me finish my drink. Oh, shut up, get in the car, you silly bitch. Officer, I've lost my dog. - Where, madame, where have you lost it? - I don't know. - Alright, come on, old love, let's go somewhere quiet, where we can talk about it, ey? - Sonny Wade upset you? - I don't give a sod about Sonny Wade. Just 'cause he's a big buyer, who reckons he can talk any way he likes to anybody. Rotten puff. - Big buyer for what? - Here. Did I tell you I was meeting Sonny Wade? - Then how did you know, that it was him? - I've been around a bit, love. - You know what I am, don't you? I think so. Yes. - Yes. Hey, this is better for you than that. - That copper, how well do you know him? - I don't. No. - But if you did, it's over? - It never started, love. - Another one over, Joe? - Yeah. Here, Charlie, give us your lighter, will you? - Alright, lads. Morning, sarge. - Sorry about this, there's a demo today.

Listen, I keep on seeing this car. - Big, American job, fairly new, lousy condition. - Blue, silver and blue. - Reckon it's a possible? - Yeah, well, I've checked with the central registry, they've got nothing, I wondered if you're knew something. - Mean anything to you, Terry? - No, nothing. - Oh, well. - Yeah, but I'm on demo later on. Thanks. - Not gone home yet? - I'm on my way. - You get off, see you get some kip now, you're gonna need it. Oh, Jesus! - Didn't know you was a housewife an'all. - You don't know nothing about me, love. - I know all about you, dear. - Wanna eat now? It's ready. You worried about something? - No, I'm alright. - Then eat. It's alright, isn't it? - Yeah, sure, it's fine. Just not hungry, that's all. - Not still bothering about Sonny Wade, are you? - Then eat your breakfast. - No, I won't have anything today, I'll be sick. - Hey. Are you doing something special today? - Oh, Christ! - Joe. - Oh, no. - Are you awake, love? - Well, of course I'm bloody awake, I haven't been to sleep yet, have I? Well, it's half 10, innit and I'm on at two. - I'm sorry to wake you, love, only Sally's got a temperature. - It's 101, she's all hot and sweaty. I've tried to phone the doctor, but I can't get through. If you'll look after her, I'll go and- - I'll go and get him. - But he mightn't be in. - Feel her cheek, it's red hot. - Oh, there, little love, we'll soon have somebody to look at you. - He won't always come on Sundays. I'm living here now. - Are you? - Hm-mm. Don't think you have to be polite, Joe. - My kid's sick, little girl, she's got a temperature. I must go. - I hope she'll be alright. What did the pig want? - Leave him alone. He's alright. He's an ordinary boy. - He's not, my love and you know it. - He's got other things on his mind, his little girl's not well. - Yeah, well, let her stay that way, keep him off of my back. - It isn't anything, I don't think, just a slight cold infection. - That's a blessing. - Yes, you could easily have brought her round to the surgery tomorrow morning. - I'm sorry, doctor, but you see, we were worried about her. - You are new patients, I know, but I don't usually make house calls on a Sunday. - How is she? - Oh, I'm sorry, I, um, I didn't know you were in the police force. - No, well, now, um, well, she'll be alright. I've given her something to take down her temperature and if you should have any more trouble, well, um, no, better still, I'll pop in again tomorrow morning. - Yes, doctor, thank you, doctor. - Well, goodbye. - Thank you, goodbye. Thank you, doctor, bye. There, there, you'll be okay now. - Oh, can't we go out somewhere? - Why? - Because. - Barry, come on. - For god's sake, what difference does it make? - It makes the difference between out and in. - Oh, here you are then, grub up. - Oh, ta, let me help you with that. - Sorry you're going so soon, Barry. - Yeah, well, my fiancee's brother's fixed me up with a job up north, I've got to go where the lolly is. - Fiancee? - That's right, yeah. - Well, I'm sorry you're going. I don't get many nice lodgers, do I? Silly old bag. - When we're gone, she won't give us another thought. If anybody asks any questions, I'm just a bloke that went off with a bird. - What happens to me then? - Whatever you like. - You have been inside, haven't you? - Maybe. - Is it today? - I'm likely to tell you, ain't I, darling? - Don't do it, Barry, please. - Shut up. - I don't care how we live. - I do. - Don't do anything just for me. - Don't kid yourself, dear. - Job, any job. - Who'd give me one? - Anything. - Anything won't do, dear, some people have everything. They do nothing for it, but they've got it. I'm like you, I never had anything ever, I never even belonged to myself, even in the Nick. When I was a kid, somebody owned me, get that? Owned me. - Sorry. - Don't be, love, no need. - I do understand, you know. - Don't be funny. - People have owned me too, you do now. - Balls. - You do. - Well, I don't want to own you, like those other fellas that had you. Go on, eat your grub. - I hate these demos. All them flying stones. - Oh, they just bounce off of me, love, they really do. - Be careful. - Course I will. - I mean it. And so do I. Joe, take care. Except once. - It's when you link arms and you can't do anything. - Well, there are others there besides me, love, I mean, I don't do it all on my own, you know. - Now look, you just look after her. I'll be back before you know it and don't forget now, if her temperature goes up again, ring the doctor, okay? - I will. - Right, I'm off. If I'm late, I won't wake you. - Joe. - What? - Wake me up. - Ey? - When you get in, promise. - Alright. - At least have some coffee. - Yeah, ta. Sue. Come with me, if you like. - I don't know, do I? - You do. - Alright then, I do. - But you're not telling. - No sense in it. - Out of the country? Maybe later. - A big job? - Big enough. - What do you want me to do? - Take the car. Wait in it for me outside Wade's place. Then we go off together. - I've never been involved in anything like this before. Never. - There's always a first time. I'm not pushing you. - Oh, I don't know. - If not, this is goodbye, love. All I can spare, dear. I'm sorry, it's- - alright, alright, it's my fault. You had this in your mind from the start, didn't you? - Right when we first met? - No. - Liar. - Course if you've got better prospects elsewhere, something you'd rather be doing, some other fella, there's no problem, is there? - Got yours in then? - Never take it off, even in bed. Alright. Weather forecast says rain later. Should be a quiet day. - Aye, that's what you think. Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! Pigs out, fascists out! - Did I say quiet? - I hope they're sending for reinforcements.
