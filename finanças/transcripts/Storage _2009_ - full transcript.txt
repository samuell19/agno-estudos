You and you, out. Not you. Do you believe in Jesus? Yes, I do. Well, you're gonna meet him. - Well? - What? What do you rate it? Death Wish 2, probably the greatest movie ever made. If by greatest you mean the most ridiculous. What do you mean? You didn't like it? Charlie Bronson, mate. The greatest actor that ever lived. Dad, his face looks like a bloody walnut. That's the only expression he's got, walnut. It's better than the shit you watch. I mean, who do you like? Christian Bale. Just because he can diet doesn't mean he can act. I mean, Charlie Bronson, mate, he's as tough as nails. If you wanted something sorted out, he'd be the bloke you call. Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen. They were tough guys, you know? Just like you, eh, Dad? Yeah, just like me. Very tough bloke. Yeah, well, since you hated it so much, next time I'll go on me own. I just thought you'd like to spend some time with your dad. Obviously, you just want to make fun of me. Dad, I was just joking around. Jesus. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Dad, listen, I'm sorry. I did like the movie. Well, that's good, mate, because next week, Death Wish 3 is playing. No, no, it's better than-- Give me your wallets! I'm not fucking around. - You're kidding now, huh? - Dad, just give it to him. Stay right where you are, Jimmy. Give me your fucking wallet. - Piss off. - Give me your fucking wallet! Shit. Give me your fucking wallet. No, no, no, I don't have anything. Fuck. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Uh, you're gonna be fine, okay? Help! Help! Help! Dad? Dad? Jimmy, your uncle is here. You still have a few minutes. - Hey, mate. - You're late. I'm sorry, mate, I got here as soon as I could. You all right? No, they haven't found the bastard yet, have they? I know, mate. I know Why aren't they doing anything about it? Well, they're doing the best they can. - Did you speak to them? - Yes, I did. Look, Jimmy. Sometimes good people get cut down, and there's not a lot the cops can do about it. I know you don't want to hear this, but they haven't got a lot to go on, mate. You know what? I'm gonna find the guy who did it, and when I do, I'm gonna fucking kill him. Hey. Jimmy, hey. Okay, you're gonna come back and stay with me for a while. Okay? Hey. We'll go through your dad's stuff tomorrow, and then you can fly over when you're ready. You're gonna stay at my place in the spare room, come and work with me at the storage facility. What do you reckon? Jimmy, I am gonna take care of you. I promise. Now, let's go and make your old man proud. Okay, deep breath. Up straight. - You're early. - Yeah. Jimmy, this is Zia. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Jimmy? Close the door, please. She's not bad, is she, mate? Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, Just don't get any ideas, though, because she won't be here too much longer. - Why's that? - She's, um-- She just really hasn't got the right attitude. Hey, come on, I'll show you around downstairs. Okay, this is where the storage units are. As you can see, it's a-- it's a pretty basic setup. Now, each storage unit has its own padlock, and the storage unit owner is the only person with a key. What if you need to get in? Well, you just call the customer and ask them come down, unless they've fallen behind on their rent. Now, if I haven't paid for a month and we can't contact them, we cut the lock with bolt cutters, we do an inventory of all their stuff, and then we put one of our own locks on. Now, see the blue one? Okay, they're ours. Now, I picked these up for Trans-Pacific. They were just gonna throw them out. So I just let the customers use them for free. You can get some pretty strange types coming in. As a rule, we just let them do what they want. But if you do see anything really dodgy, you come and get me and I'll sort it out. Oh, and your mobile phone won't work down here. You don't get any coverage. This is the boiler room. This is where the air conditioning unit is. Basically keeps the place from turning into a sauna. Why have you got so many rat traps lying around? Oh, no real reason. Just better safe than sorry, I reckon. And that's where you type this in, eh? And then press record. If you have any other questions, just ask me. The computer system only went in three months ago, and Leonard's still having problems. Don't tell him I said that, though. Hey. Leonard told me about your father. I'm really sorry to hear about what happened to him. Yeah. If you need anything... just give me call. Thank you. Excuse me. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hello. - Hi. I was wondering if you could offer me some assistance. The light bulb's gone in my room. I was hoping you might be able to go down and change it for me. - Yeah, sure. - Oh. Uh, I know where every single thing is in that room, so... no touchy. Thank you so much. Hey, Jimmy. - How you going? - Yeah, um, this woman-- Yeah, that's Carol. She's a fine one, isn't she? You know, she keeps her storage unit full of her dead husband's stuff? He's been dead for five years. That's really weird. Mate, everyone's doing something weird in this place, Like, have a look at this guy. He's going bankrupt, so he's trying to stick the tax department by hiding his furniture. I mean, he's even getting his little girl to help him. Oh, and, uh, okay, that's Jobbo. He's got boxes full of chemistry equipment he uses to make meth. I reckon he sells it to school kids. How do you know all this stuff? Well, you just talk to customers, you know, keep your eyes open. You can tell a lot about someone by what they keep in the storage unit, mate. Wow. Hello. Yes. What do you want? I, um-- I heard something. I was just checking if you're okay. I'm fine. Fine. Yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, you sounded upset. You listen to me. This is my private unit that I've paid for. What the hell are you doing watching me? - No, no, no, I wasn't, mate. No. - Bullshit. Whatever you got in there, I didn't say it, okay? - You cheeky little bastard. - Excuse me. I know what you're up to. You sneak around here, peak into people's units, see what you can find, hm? What? And you come back for it later. Yeah? Well, you're fucked now. I've done nothing wrong, okay. I was just doing my job. The fuck is wrong with you? You fucking prick! I'll snap you in two. Bloody hell. Get the fuck off me. Want to have a go? You want to have a go? Come on, take your shot. No? I didn't think so. Holy shit. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - What happened? - He just kind of went crazy. He thinks I'm trying to spy on him or something. Excuse me, sir. Can I speak to you for a moment? Jimmy, stay. Excuse me. Mr. Piasecki, is it? - Yes, that's right. - Hi, I'm Leonard Walker, I'm the manager here. My nephew, Jimmy, seems to think there might be a problem. I was putting some things away in my unit, and I turn around and find this kid spying on me. All right? It startled me. No, I can understand that. I hate to ask this, but do you have anything illegal in there? No, of course not. Look, I'm extremely sorry for this intrusion. It's Jimmy's first day on the job, and I just think he just got a little bit overexcited. - Good, good. - Well, thanks very much for your understanding, and I guarantee you this will not happen again. We'll let you get back to what you're doing. Thank you. Jimmy? Leonard, he had a gun in there, and he was smelling something. Well, maybe he hit up a florist. Leonard, he had something in a garbage bag. - Like what? - Something dodgy. Everyone's got something dodgy in their units, Jim. - Yes, but Leonard, this-- - What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do, Jimmy? Right. Let's just go. All right, mate? Come on, come on. Can you get the door, Jimmy? I'm just gonna get dinner ready, so will you be all right? Yeah. Okay, here, we have in here a steak. Real big. Listen, you want a drink, Jim? Hey, you all right? I should have done something. Hey. It's not your fault. Never forget that. The bloke who killed your old man, he was the scum of the Earth. He was an evil man. - You'll be all right. - Yeah. Let's go have something to eat, eh? Yeah. Oh. Buggers. Why wasn't I born a cat, eh? Eh? Stuck in traffic? Car wouldn't start. Piece of shit. Where's Leonard? He's, uh, downstairs. Don't worry, I won't tell him. Thank you. What are you doing there? Just checking out this guy with a gun. Hey, how can I find out what he has in his unit? Well, apart from asking him... Yeah, obviously. Um, well, you can look at the surveillance footage, see if you can catch a glimpse of him sneaking in with his contraband. How would I know which side to look at? It's all on the system. Customers have to key in and out every time they visit. Show me. It's just a box. Hmm, fast forward. Why'd he put the box in the barrel? We tell people to do that if they want to put something away for a long time. Protects against mold. And rats. At least you know he doesn't have a dead body in there. Yeah, unless he's chopped it up in little pieces. That's revolting. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Well, why don't you get up, have a shower, wake yourself up, eh? We've got to go in a half an hour. - G'day, Jobbo. - G'day. Jimmy, this is Jobbo. - How you doing, mate? - Hm. He's a nasty piece of work, isn't he? Yeah. Might as well have drug dealer tattooed on his forehead. Okay, get your camera ready. Okay, good? Bit of a mess, eh? Jesus. Okay, Jimmy, this is a legal thing. I need you to take photos of everything in the unit, and I'll fill out the inventory list. - 'Kay, 'kay? - Yup. Hop to it. What do you do if you find something illegal in one of these units? Well, I don't know. It depends what it is. What if it's something really bad? Would you call the cops? Jimmy, I can't tell you how many times I've seen something dodgy and I've called the cops, only to have them do absolutely nothing about it. Why do you ask, mate? It's just that guy. The biker? No, no, no, the guy with the gun, Francis Piasecki. What if he had something illegal in his unit? Okay, Jimmy, right now, I just need you to focus on what we're doing. Yeah, okay. Leonard. Yeah. Oh, shit. They're just kids. It's a whole box full of them. - Jesus. - That's him, Jimmy. That's the guy who owns the store unit. Where is he now? Well, I don't know. I haven't heard from him in months. I reckon he's probably buggered off to Thailand or something. - Should we call the cops? - No, we're not gonna call the cops. Then what are we gonna do, Leonard? We're going to burn it. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thinking about your dad? Listen, um, you know that guy I was looking at the other day, Francis? Yeah. Is there a way to get into his unit without breaking the law? Uh... not really. There is, isn't there? I don't think I should tell you. Zia, Come on, please. You have to. Leonard's got lock picks in his desk. They're for when rats die in the units and he has to get them out without the customer knowing, but you won't know how to use them. So just forget about it, okay? Yeah. Okay. - Zia. - Yeah? You stole the lock picks. Are you crazy? No, I just borrowed them. And as soon as we go find out what's in Francis' unit, I'll put them straight back. You want me to go with you? Yeah. Can you use them? - Maybe. - Can you? Jimmy, go and talk to Leonard, okay? Don't you get the feeling that Leonard knows these guys are storing illegal things and he's covering up for them or something? Do you know what I'm talking about? Come on, it's a one off thing. He won't find out. I promise. It'll be fun. Okay. When are we going? It's reassuring for me to come here and visit. Just being in that room surrounded by Terry's things, I almost feel like I'm with him. I-- I do miss him terribly, but make no mistake, I have moved on. Which one of these things do you think I should sell? Terry was fond of his collection, but he'd understand the position I'm in. After all, a man is more than their possessions. I couldn't agree more, Carol. - Hey. - Hi. You got everything? Let's do it. Good. Did you hear that? Shit. What are you doing? We, uh-- We just, uh-- - You were just what? - We're just looking for rats. Leonard, listen, Jimmy was just worried - that one of your clients-- - Okay, you're fired. I can't have you breaking into people's units, and that's all there is to it. - Leonard-- - Go. - Leonard, Leonard, she had nothing-- - Shut up. Shut up. What the fuck were you doing? - We just-- - Do you realize if the police found out about this, I could be shut down. They're not going to. Well, what if she decides she doesn't like us anymore, Jimmy? What's gonna stop here from going to the cops or suing us or blackmailing us or anything else? Leonard, she wouldn't do that. And you know her so well, do you? Give me my lock picks. I told you, if you have a problem, if there's something dodgy that you need checking out, you'd come and ask me. Leonard, listen to me. There is something in that barrel. Just go have a look, please. Please. Okay, w-what else is in there? That's it, a bunch of clothes. No, no. This-- - Smell this. - What? Smell this. Oh... It's dirty. Why has Mr. Piasecki got a bunch of dirty women's clothing in his storage unit? I-- That's it. That's-- That's it there. Whoa. Ah... He shot her. Okay, Jimmy, let's get out of here. Wait, did you see that? Look. Leonard, that's an arm. Yeah, you're right. Leonard, we have to do something about this. Okay, yeah. No, I'll get back to you. Hey. Hey, how you doing? Fine, good. Uh, listen, I was really wanting to call you, but, um... I couldn't. That's okay. - Do you want to come in? - Yes. Yeah. You're, uh, leaving. Yeah, I'm gonna head up north and get a job on the reef, get some sun. Oh, yeah? Um, listen. I just really want to say I'm sorry for what happened the other night. It's okay. Doesn't matter. You should have got two weeks notice anyway. What's this? It's, uh, $720. - Where'd you get it from? - It's my wages. - I'm not taking it. - No, no, no, it's yours. Why'd you do this? I just thought it'd be the right thing to do. Well, you could have left it in my letterbox or slipped it under my door. Yeah, I just thought that if I came in... What? What did you think? I don't know. I just wanted to talk to you. Well, if you wanted to talk to me, you could have-- you could have called me on the telephone. What did you think would happen in my motel room? I don't know. Did you think we'd make out? - No. - Get a little frisky? - No. - Well, what did you think would happen? Nothing. Nothing. Thank you very much for the money. You're a... good man. Yeah, I-- I just thought that I'd make it up to you. I was just about to go out. So... - I -- - Shh! Shh. You should come up north with me. We could get a place together. It would be fun. I'm serious. You should come with me. I'll look after you to you. What about Leonard? He's a big boy. I think he can take care of himself. Yeah, I-- I can't just leave. Yes, you can. You can do anything. I can't leave. He's my family. Well, just have a think about it, okay? Yeah, okay. Oh, I'll definitely think about it. How can I help you? I want a refund. I'm sorry, we don't do refunds. You do now. No. No, we don't. I paid six months in advance. You know what you did, don't you? Um, I-- I haven't done anything. You don't want to fuck with me, kid. - I'm not. - Then hand over 600 bucks, and I'll leave it at that. - Jimmy? - Yeah. Give him the refund, come and see me in my office. Okay. There's $500. 550, 600. It's your lucky day. No, mate. It's your lucky day. Shit. What do we do now? Did you see that? - What? - The boxes in the garage? Yeah. Looks like he's going somewhere. - What should we do? - Well, we can call the cops. They'll go and knock on his door, he'll give them some bullshit story and by tomorrow morning he'll be gone. He'll get away with it. Just like the bloke who killed your father. So, what should we do? What do you think? We should find out where he put that body. You're right. Leonard, where we going? Just gonna borrow some stuff from one of our clients. - What if he notices it's gone? - No, he's in China. He won't be back for months. Have you got a black top with you? No. Okay. You can wear my jacket. - It's up in the office. - Okay. ♪ Take me back ♪ To the way I was ♪ Just a vacation - Hello. - Hey. So, what have you decided? Do you still want me to come with you? Of course I do. D-Do you want to come with me? Yeah, yeah. I think I do. Great. Um... Okay, uh, why don't you come over tonight and we can talk about it? Uh, listen, not tonight. Um... listen, I'll give you a call tomorrow. Okay? Okay. Um, just give me a call in the morning. Be good to see you. Nice to see you, too. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay, he should be asleep by now. What if someone sees us? Middle of the night, mate. We'll be all right. Here. Put that on. What for? Just give him a bit of a scare, eh? Close the door. Leonard, what the-- Shh. Pick up the bag.

What about the bloody clothes, Francis? - What about the gun? - They were my wife's. It was she was wearing when she shot herself. I asked the cops for her stuff back. I didn't know what to do with it, so I thought, I'll put it in storage. You got it all wrong, guys. Put it back on, Jimmy. He fucking already knows who we are. I'm sorry, mate.

Okay, Jimmy, put the rope in the bag. Close it. Close the door. Here. You'll be okay to follow me, won't you? Yeah. Jimmy, hey. Just hold it together, okay? You did good. Stay under the speed limit.

Yeah. - Wait, what are you-- Just a bit further, mate. - Just hang in there, Jimmy. - Okay. Okay, okay. Jimmy. Jimmy? Jimmy, help me put him in. We'll have to chop his legs off. We'll be all right. What's in those barrels? What do you reckon? Holy shit. Oh, fuck. That's Stuart. The kiddie fiddler with the photos. You killed him? Yeah. When did you kill him? Four months ago. So, when we cleaned out his room, you had already killed him. Yeah. I had to know I could trust you, mate. Uh... - Jimmy. - Oh, my God. I just thought you of all people would understand this. To your father. He was killed by some fucking animal who doesn't deserve to live. My brother. He's dead no reason. He didn't do anything wrong, Jimmy, just like the kids that Stuart abused didn't do anything wrong. He abused them, and then took photos of them and then sent them to his mates. I watched him for months. I wanted someone to stop him, but no one would. No one would stop him. This coward killed a 93-year-old woman. You want to hear something funny? That fucker was a cop who had a thing for young girls. I killed him two years ago, and it was the best thing I ever did. Or are you saying I did the wrong thing? Hm? What would you do, Jimmy? Would you just ignore it? You just let people rape and murder and not do anything about it and just say, Oh, well, that's the way the fucking world is? No. I do what must be done because no one else will do it. No one except me. But now there's me and you. What do you reckon? And what about Francis? What about him? - He didn't kill his wife. - Yes, he did. He killed her, and he made it look like a suicide. I saw his fucking face! He didn't kill her! He confessed to the crime! What more do you want? And anyway, even if he didn't do it, he would have done it sooner or later. You could see it in him. Shit, Jimmy, you were the one who wanted to get him. This is fucking hard work doing what I do. - You set me up. - I thought you'd be happy. You fucking-- You fucking set me up. You fucking set me up. You settle down. Get the fuck away from me. Calm down. Thought a night down here might help slow you down. Now, if I let you out, you're not gonna go crazy on me, are you? Shit, Jimmy, what did you think we were doing here? You shouldn't have killed him. What did you expect me to do? He didn't do anything wrong, Leonard. He killed his wife. End of story. Don't you fuck with me, mate. I saved your ass when everything was falling down around you. You owe me. I could just forget about you down here. No one would know. No one would come looking for you. So I think you better start showing me a little respect. Leonard! - G'day, Zia. - Hi. Uh, is Jimmy here? No. Where is he? Well, I don't know. We had a fight, and when I went back home to see if he was there, his bags were gone. So... I thought he was with you. No. Now, where do you reckon he is? I don't know. Um, his-- his phone is off. Okay. - Why did he run away? - No, he didn't run away. No, he wanted to go out, and I said he couldn't. Then he started calling me some rude words, and basically, he just took off in a huff. Maybe something's happened to him then. - Maybe. - Should we call the police? I don't know, Zia. Where you headed off to? Um, heading up north. Oh, okay. What, you got family up there? No, I'm gonna work on the reef. Oh, it's great, Zia. Good on you. Well, and you're driving up there by yourself, are you? - Yeah. - You're a brave girl. You want to be careful you don't pick up any of those dodgy hitchhikers. Eh? - I'm-- I'm gonna, um-- - Hey, listen. Actually, Jimmy left a letter with your name on it. Now, I didn't know if you're coming back or not, so I just put it downstairs with the rest of his stuff. If you like, we can go down and get it? Uh... Or, look, don't. I don't give a shit. - You want to get it? - Yeah, yeah. You know, I'm really sorry about what happened. You're a good little worker. Just a shame things turn out the way they do. After you. Just in there. Why did you put it in there? Well, that's where I keep all my stuff. Leonard, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. You might have to hold it in. Keys and phone. - Leonard? - Back it up. Back it up! Leonard. - Pl-- - Shh. Holy shit. Jimmy. What's going on? Get down on the ground. See, this is your fault, Jimmy. You should have done what I told you to, eh? Leonard, don't! Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay. No, you're right, Jimmy. You're going to kill her. I need to know I can trust you, mate. Now, either you kill her... or I'm gonna have to kill you. I don't want to do that, Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy? Quit bullshittin', or you're fucked. Step back. Jimmy. Hey! Zia, run! Fuck. Jimmy! - Come on, come on! - The keys. Give me the keys. Jimmy, come on. Oh, shit. - Come on! Come on! - Shit! Shh, shh! What? Fuck. We gotta go. We gotta go. Wait, wait. Oh, shit. What the fuck is going on? To the fire escape. Come on. Oh, shit. Oh! Zia! Jimmy! Ah, shit. Jimmy! Tell me where you are and we'll sit down and talk about it. Come on, Jimmy. This is silly, mate. I'm getting tired, Jimmy! Fuck, Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy. Drop the gun and turn around. Ah, Jimmy. You can't do it. You haven't got it in you. Now just put--
