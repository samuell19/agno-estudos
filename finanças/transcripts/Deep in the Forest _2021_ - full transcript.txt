Welcome to politics today. We're speaking with professor Gerald loss Sinclair fellow of political science at Eldridge university. Professor loss is America becoming a fascist state? Well frankly I think it's preposterous the idea that the United States could somehow become a dictatorship. It's a science fiction. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that fascism is fiction or that fascism doesn't flourish all over the world but this is America. We have a system of checks and balances designed to prevent any one branch of government from exercising an inordinate amount of power. Believe me this too will pass. America will never be governed by a dictator or demagogue or a king. The America of today is not the Germany of the 1930's. The average American is not going to buy into a philosophy of hatred. We are a nation of immigrants. How is anyone going to convince us to hate ourselves. Our democracy is resilient. We will come through this and without the civil war some people are talking about. Look I understand people are scared but I can assure you there's absolutely nothing to worry about. Believe me. It's all Much Ado About Nothing. First up one great American news we have field correspondent Malecki reporting from the capitol building. Well Charles as you can see immigrants, minorities, socialists and other dissidents are once again protesting in the streets. These traders are making it abundantly clear that they have one objective. To destroy America. Enough. Mom! Off. Don't you want me to be informed? The world is going to hell in a hand basket. There you're informed. That's censorship. Yes it is. Now come on honey, you gotta go do your homework. Hail the conquering hero. You won. Maria Rodriguez is on a path to citizenship. Score one for the good guys. How was school? The board is trying to ban "1984." Oh yeah? Actually it's pretty ironic if you think about. It's scary is what it is. Do you think your law firm could get involved? We do civil rights not censorship. I know but aren't the students civil rights being violated somehow I mean they have a right to a complete education don't they. They do. A lawsuit won't do it? No. Oh, it was worth a shot. Don't forget, we got the Dem club meeting tonight. Right. Right. Hey kiddo. Mom wouldn't let me watch the news. That's censorship. That's what I said. You took these with your cell phone? Yep. You have a good eye. I know. You also know that when you use a printer you don't have to let them dry right? Yeah but that's how they do it in all the movies. Okay. The babysitter is gonna be here soon. Your mom and I will be back in a few hours. What's the democratic club? It's a place where lonely leftists rehash the same arguments they've been having for years. So why are you still going? Because your mom needs to feel like she still the activist she used to be. She's standing right behind me isn't she? I can't believe you said that! What? The activist she used to be. Come on. You do more for social justice in one class then Dem club has in the last ten years. You make it sound like a coffee klatch. Okay before we get started let me remind everyone that the coffee is on the back table next to the minutes from last month's meeting. The September meeting of democratic club is now in session and the first item on the agenda is going to be the Christmas fundraiser. I understand that we have some options here. You're not serious with everything that's going on you want to talk about a fundraiser? We have a process Max. You know that. Max what would you like to talk about? Where to begin? The suppression of the free press. State sanctioned hate crimes mass deportations. I've even heard that the government is building detention camps... Have you heard that? Okay okay okay. Let's start with the camps. There has been questionable construction going on in most states. Also that the government has been making lists. Exactly what kind of lists are we talking about? I'm chief of staff for senator Quick and I... Would that be state senator Quick? The point is if the government were compiling lists I think I'd know about it. I don't know what to tell you David. Who's that? The information we have is that government is... Definitely a government spy. Is listing names of... progressive academics, journalists, activists... May I say something? I was a professor of European history for forty years. We all know who we are Max. I'm simply establishing the fact that I'm qualified to speak with authority on the subject at hand. That guy's really starting to creep me out. It's not new the government is normalizing fascism. Just going a little further further each time. The national socialists did the same thing. Hitler didn't start with Auschwitz. He started by demonizing immigrants. Harassing dissidents and controlling the press. Does any of that sound familiar? If you'll permit me to read to key article of our constitution. I think... Max, I don't think we have time. Oh my god! There's been a bomb in the capitol building. What? They're claiming it was the protesters. It's the Reichstag fire all over again. You think the government did this? What better excuse to crack down on dissidents? Just because there's a motive doesn't mean... How are protesters going to get into the capitol building at ten o'clock at night? We are not talking about a plane or a van. Somebody had to have security clearance. Due to the latest incident I think we should call it a night. I move to adjourn. Second. The meeting is adjourned and I suggest that you all stay home tonight until we find out what the government's going to do about this incident. What was that about? Amy fell asleep editing photos. Don't tell me, we have an artist on our hands. God help us. What did you think about what Max saying tonight? You're asking if I think the government orchestrated the bombing as an excuse to crackdown on dissidents? It's a Brave New World. Sure, you know Max he's always been paranoid. Hands in plain view. What the hell? You are under arrest by order of the United States government. I wanna see warrant. Noted. Now move. I said move. Grab the girl. Come out with your hands up. Mommy, I'm scared. I know honey, just try to think of it as a game. Nancy? Nancy Washington? Who's there? It's me. It's Max. Max Steiner. What's going on? I don't know. Is thank you Ethan? Yeah. I'm here to David Gretsch. And Jack Visby. There's somebody else here. Who are you? Abi. Abi Dabiri. Dabiri? You're new at the club. I've only been to a few meetings. How come we haven't said anything? I haven't had anything to say. This isn't a coincidence. No. They must be using the Dem club's membership list. Okay, but who are they? Where do you think they're taking us? Maybe some kind of detention camp? Let's hope so. What are you talking about? He means it's preferable to the alternative. Everybody out. This is how they do it. Anybody with a dissenting voice... They round you up. Take you to the forest and make you dig your own grave and put a bullet in your... That's enough. Mom, are they gonna hurt us? Just try to be brave okay. Halt. You can take your hoods off. Oh thank God. You made it. Will someone tell us what's going on? Are you all right? I'm sorry about all the drama. If this is some kind of joke... Believe me, if there was some other way... Some other way! Do you have any idea what we've just been through? I mean Jesus Christ here's another way how bout you just fucking tell people first. People thought we were gonna be killed for fuck's sake. Please! I'm gonna tell you all I know. Last night the government started arresting dissidents. People who have been signing petitions or going to rallies. Or belong to a democratic club? Exactly. What you mean all across the country? The president used the bombing at the capitol building as an excuse to invoke the war powers act. Five minutes later he declares martial law and the military starts rounding everybody up. Thanks to Martin we knew it was coming. So you just kidnapped us? Would you rather be in a camp? No of course not but you can't keep us here wherever the hell here is. Now listen, there's armed conflicts happening across the entire country. You're a wanted man. You want to go? Go. In fact, Martin's heading back to the fighting he'll take you with him, sure and all of you whoever wants to leave, leave. Be my guest. So what do you think? It's... definitely different. Is it safe? As long as they don't find out we're here. Who owns it? Someone from the resistance. Free America, they call themselves or I guess I should say what we call ourselves. Free America? Smart branding at least. Is there any electricity? Yeah, we have a generator in the basement. Okay everyone. Coffee will be ready in about five minutes. I'll give you hand Sandy. Now it really is a Dem club meeting. How are you feeling? Oh, uh, much better thank you. Do you mind if I check your pulse? You're a doctor? Neurosurgeon, although right now I'd rather be a cardiologist. Can I ask you a question? Shoot. How did you pull this off? You mean how did we get you all out? Yeah that and this place. It was mostly Martin. Free America was organizing on the dark web for months. A few weeks ago Martin came to me and said that all of us run arrest list and he was assigned to get us to a safe house. Sounded crazy but... for some reason I believed him. Are there other safe houses? All over the country. Speaking of all over the country, where exactly are we? I don't know. What does that mean? Well Sandy and I got here the exactly the same way you did. The less we know the better. You mean if we're caught. Still you could give us some warning. No I couldn't. The arrest had to look legit. You know Martin risked everything to bring us all here. You doing OK bubba? I'm perplexed. Join the club kid. Listen, I'm going to explain everything to you later okay. Want to go grab a couple cookies from the kitchen? Hey no TV but I, uh, I found a radio. Raids continued throughout the night. Thousands of suspected terrorists have been taken into custody prompting the military to declare Operation Patriot an unqualified success. So it's over? That's state media. See if you can get a Canadian station. How much of the military is on our side? According to Martin, it's not just guerilla raids we're talking full blown civil war. Here we go. Here's more of Tom Davis with updates from the U. S. Fierce fighting continues in all major cities throughout the United States. Preliminary reports suggest that casualties are already in the thousands. Jesus. It seems that the Free America forces are well organized, well equipped and prepared for a prolonged conflict. How long can we stay here? As long as we need to. Or until the food runs out. Well that shouldn't be a problem. Martin will be back in a month to resupply. No the... only concern is that make sure that nobody knows we're here. Anybody have a cell phone? Good because one GPS signal and we're finished. I have a question. Okay. Who put you in charge? Mark risked his life to save ours. I'm not questioning that and believe me I'm grateful but just because mark is the president of a democratic club doesn't mean he is the right leader in this situation. But you are? I didn't say that. No but you were thinking it. David's right. We haven't had a vote. I make a motion that mark leads us. I second the motion. Any discussion? Hearing none. All in favor? Ay. Ay. Any opposed. Motion carried. Okay well let's get to work. A Muslim and a Jew putting up Christmas lights. That's funny I didn't even think about that. You're a journalist. You know what people are. All I'm saying is that this whole Shangri la thing eventually it's gonna come down to survival of the fittest. Are you listening to me? No. Rice? On top. Yah vol. Need a hand? We've got it thanks. Suit yourselves. We're putting the food in that corner and everything else over there. By we you mean... You. Right. Food. Not food. So we're gonna do for clothes? I'm partial to Armani. Mark went to a thrift store. You can't be serious. Not food. MREs... Yum. You said you'd explain everything. I did didn't I? Did you and Daddy do something wrong? No, of course not honey. Then why are we here? Well... your dad and I want the world to be a better place. And this is it? No. Not exactly. What are you doing? Martin says there was a safe room behind the display in the basement where we can all hide. And you think this is it? Yeah I do. I think so. Move. I was about to do that. What are you doing? Taking pictures. Is the GPS on? No. Thank God. I don't want strangers to know where I am. Me either. So can I keep it? I don't think that's a good idea kiddo. But Dad, we're stuck out here. My art is my only means of personal expression. I'm serious. I can see that. All right. I'll tell you what. If you actually promise not to tell anyone. I promise. I'm serious. So am I. How you guys doing? We're almost done. Did you find that room? Piece of cake. I'm gonna go make some coffee. How did you do? Well, I divvied up all the clothes. Now we're thrift shop chic. What the fuck is this? I'm glad to see him good for morale. Someone has to be on the look out all the time? Yep. We don't want anybody sneaking up on us do we? Can I try? Sure. Use that to focus. Does that work? Yeah looks great. Let's just hope we never have to use it. I see a car. What? The basement. Come on move everybody. I gotta get Amy. Food in that corner and everything else over there. How about my foot in your ass. Oh shit! Amy! Ethan! We need to get downstairs now. Okay, okay. Go, go, go. Run baby, run. Faster, faster. Go, go, go. Get in. I saw the car first. Very good work young lady. But from now on we're gonna have to whisper. I found this in the first aid kit. It might help you hear better. Yeah that's worth a try. How many are there? Just one. He's not military. Maybe a neighbor? If it's just one guy. We're not there yet. He might be a fugitive like us. Who just wandered by a safe house? Maybe he's the owner? Or he knows the owners not here and it's the best time to rob the place. Maybe he'll just take what he wants and go away. And what if he doesn't then we lose the element of surprise. I'm aware that. Maybe we could talk to him? There's an old Russian proverb. One meets no friends deep in the forest. Shh. He's coming downstairs. I know you're there. I have a knife. And I've got a gun. What's your name? Jeff Mills. You're on the run ain't ya? Hey, we're asking the questions. Says who? Says the guy with the gun. I thought we were done for. Where did Mark get the gun? He says Martin gave it to him. What are you doing here? My job. Which is what? I winterize the lodges. Lock them up. Make sure the pipes don't freeze. So what you're saying is you don't have anything do with the war? I've seen the soldiers So what's the story? Well he says he has nothing to do with the war. Do you believe him? I do. So we're detaining an innocent man? What are you his lawyer now? Well it looks like he needs one. Let's focus on what we're gonna do with this guy. We don't have to do anything. We just let him go. What makes you think that redneck's not gonna turn us into the first local he comes across? That guy's country to the core and I got news for you. Those folks are not on our side. That's a classist assumption. Maybe... but I'm not going to gamble with my life just to prove that I'm PC. Mark, what do you think we should do with him? Well... I think we should lock him up. Are you serious? It's ironic isn't it? Righteous fugitives become reluctant jailers. Locking him up. What would that entail? I can't believe you're even considering this. Any of you. Where would you keep him? We. I think it's important to realize that if we're going to do this, we're all going to do this. There's a walk in closet. We can convert it into a cell. A cell? We can make it like a bedroom. What if... somebody misses him? He's not wearing a wedding ring. A guy like that is dating his right hand and a bottle of Bourbon believe me. No one is going to miss this guy. What about the moral considerations? Look, we're not talking about hurting him. That isn't the point. And what is the point? It's not who we are. Max. Am I right? Maybe it's who we have to be. You don't have to do this. Yeah I'm afraid we do. You gotta be fucking kidding me. You'll get plenty of food. A shower a day. This is bullshit. I agree but it's the best we could do. Just out of curiosity, what do you think of the president? The president is going to win this war and scumbags like you are going to get bullets in the head. Jack was right. That guy is not on our side. Put his truck in the garage. On it. You're not listening to me. I am listening to you. What I'm not doing is agreeing with you. You realize he's just some guy who looks after the lodge. That doesn't mean we can trust him. What are you doing? Looking for something to read. Shouldn't you be annoying your parents? You don't like kids, do you? No. Why not? Because they're short. That's fucking stupid. Do your parents know that you swear like a sailor? They say it's okay as long as I use the expletives for emphasis. Do they have the lord of the rings? No, just airport thrillers, celebrity biographies, What are they? Gossip for the mentally deficient. How much do you know about the constitution? Nothing. Now that is a situation we are going to have to rectify. Sit. You know what this is? This is a copy of the constitution of the United States. Little book. Big ideas. I regard this document with the same reverence other people reserve for the Bible. You know why? Because this is the owner's manual for our great democracy. Fuck off. Starve if you want to. It won't be my doing. Hey. How long are you going to keep me here? Not a moment longer than we have to. Six weeks into what is now being called America's second civil war, military strategists have begun referring to the conflict as a war of attrition. Neither side has gained significant ground in recent clashes and it seems certain that hostilities will extend through Christmas. Mom. What? I need a hat and gloves. What? Why? It's really cold outside. Thanks. Worried about the weather? The cold is going to be a problem. It's gonna get worse. Why don't you call everybody in for a meeting. Where's Amy? She's reading up stairs. Twenty four weeks on the outside. I mean... All right people listen up. Clearly we have some decisions to make. Martin is two weeks overdue. It doesn't look like the war is going to be ending anytime soon and... now we're gonna have to deal with the winter. We could throw a Donner party. Too soon? How much food do we have left? About a month's worth if we start rationing. What about gas for the generator? About the same. We could use the fireplaces for heat. The smoke. You'd see it for miles. So what do you think? One of us is going to have to go on a supply run. You realize you are not gonna have any idea where you are once you get out there. I have a watch with a compass. I'll be back before you even know it. Listen, I need you to be in charge while I'm away. I need you to do this. I'll need this. Mark. You know I can still go if you want me to. Thanks. It's gotta be me. Mark. Don't think we're not grateful. She's right. You did good. Hey. Get over here. You be careful in those woods you hear. You too. Deal. Give me a hug. Yeah yeah yeah. I'll be back in a couple of days. This for Mills? Yeah it should still be hot. What? The gun. Oh right. Make sure you bring it right back. Yeah. Where's your boss? Mark's not my boss. Man, I really get you doing some shit work don't they? Get it? Shit work. I have a master's degree in political science. So that's it. What? That's why they have you emptying my latrine. Oh why is that? Because they're jealous. They know you're the one who should be calling the shots. They can't handle that so what do they do They make you shit boy. I dumped my deuce for the day. Run on shit boy. Fuck you. You're not on for another hour. I know. I just thought we could talk. About what? Do you like movies? Not particularly. I ask because the situation here reminds me of a movie called The Quiet Earth. It's the story of a woman who has to choose between the last two men on earth. Not gonna happen. What? Never mind two, I wouldn't sleep with you if you're the last man on earth. Come on, I'm a journalist I'm just asking questions. The latest reports suggest that at least six U.N. infantry divisions have crossed the Canadian border. Those divisions are expected to begin supporting resistance forces in Michigan, Wisconsin and New York by the end of the week. Ethan. I think I see something. What? Where? Over there. I don't see anything. Look again, way in the distance. They're not government. And they don't look like free America. It's probably just some yahoos out to steal whatever they can get their hands on. You mean looters? Every war's got them. The U.N. is sending troops to support free America. That's great. Shit. Where's Amy? I don't know. Amy, Amy! Cool. Amy! What are you thinking? Where did you get this? It's mine. Who else knows about it? Just Dad. Thank God. Mom knows about the phone. Later. Is everybody in the panic room? Sandy went to get Mills. Sandy? Downstairs. Go, go, go. I need you to come with me. Is there someone here? Help! Now get on your feet and keep your mouth shut. You bitch. Keep an eye on him. Jesus, what did you do to him? What I had to. There are two armed men up stairs. Hopefully they're just gonna take what they want and then leave but in the meantime I need you guys to stay back. What about you? I got the door. Shouldn't you have a gun? No. All clear. Let's see we got. So. What's the damage? They took all the valuables they could carry. We can't eat valuables. They also took three quarters of the food. We have maybe... ten days if we stretch it. What about the gasoline? Gone. Not what was already in the generator but everything else. We could use the camping lanterns at night. And if we run the heat for a few hours. We're gonna freeze to death. Okay... What do you suggest? I think we should leave. Because it's so much warmer out there in the woods? Look... food's not coming to us. If we leave now we've got ten days to find some. If we wait we lose that option. Didn't Mark try exactly what you're suggesting? At least we'll be doing something. It's not just a question of doing something It's a question of doing the right thing. Nancy, what do you think? I think we should stay. There are just too many unknowns out there. We don't know where we are. We don't know which army controls which territories. We don't know where to find supplies. We don't know where to find shelter. We only have one gun. At least here we have a roof over our heads. We have some food. We have some protection. Going out there, blind and defenseless. I think that's suicide. Why don't you tell us the real reason you don't want to go. I just gave you a handful. You know Amy would never make it. Now wait a minute. I'm just saying what everybody's thinking. No, actually you're not. One speaker at a time. Oh. Wait, wait are you in charge again because no offense but when those rednecks were having a field day at our expense back there you weren't exactly a pillar of strength. How come everyone always prefaces an offensive remark by saying no offense. Maybe David is right. Maybe we do need a new leader. Fine. Now I obviously have the most leadership experience so... Not the whole chief of staff monologue again please. I think Nancy should take over. She's strong. She's reasonable. She's a natural leader. Nancy is our best option. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. I abstain. I'm biased. Well... assuming Nancy is willing... that's five yeas... one nay... one absension. So. Do we stay or do we go? We stay. Fuck. Democracy's a bitch. Oh fuck off. I don't think I've ever dressed up for bed before. Amy is wearing so many layers she looks like a beach ball. Come on Nance, are you gonna talk to me? How could you let Amy keep her phone? The GPS was off. Do you really think anyone's going to believe that? Is that what you're worried about? That's it isn't it You're worried that if the others find out about the phone they'll put somebody else in charge. Why didn't you back me this afternoon? You mean why'd I abstain? Because I don't like what this place is doing to you. What protecting my daughter? Our daughter. Then act like it. Oh Sandy. You're gonna catch your death out here. I keep hoping Mark will come driving out of the woods with some crazy story about how he couldn't possibly get back until now. Not that you're doing a bad job or... No, no I get it. I understand. Did... you want something? Some breakfast. Oh geez. You standing out here and I completely... No worries. I'll get on it right away. Thanks Sandy. Good morning. I'll take three eggs over easy, two pieces of bacon and a warm croissant. And some French preserves please. Or some really old oatmeal would be great too. Sit down. I take it this is some Avant garde art project. Toilet paper. Right. Nancy. Do you have a second? Of course, I was just hoping that the looters had left something behind but so far no luck. What's up? Max didn't do to well last night. What happened? The cold is debilitating. And I think he's been having chest pains he's not telling me about. How do you know that? His nitro tablets are almost gone. Okay. I'll run the heating for three hours tonight and, uh, could use an extra blanket? It couldn't hurt. I'll take care of it. Thanks. That's it? Nancy said to put Mills on half rations. Given him a full portion. But Nancy said... I'll talk to Nancy. David, how many blankets does Mills have? Two, I think. Take one please, we need it for Max. Okay. Hey shit boy. What's this? Your rations have been cut. By her? Me! I don't know. Looks like somebody got a demotion. What do you mean? From a handgun to a crowbar... That's a demotion in my book. I don't need a gun to deal with you. She took it didn't she? Your balls and my breakfast. That woman's a thief. I'll tell you what. You want full portions again? You have to do something for me. I ain't going to blow you. How well do you know this area? Like the back of my hand. Why? You thinking about making a run for it? You are aren't you? If you do you're gonna need me. In your dreams. I know these woods. Sure as shit know how to get out of 'em. I can find food, shelter. Hell I'll even vouch for you if we run into the government patrol. What do you say? We got a deal? I'm waiting. Give me a second, I'm thinking. What's the matter? It smells funny. It's old. It kinda smells like you. I'm old too. Where'd you get it? It belonged to my father. He had to study the constitution to become a United States citizen. And after passing the exam, he carried that with him everywhere he went, the rest of his life. Like you do. Exactly. Amy. Max needs to rest. One more question, please? Okay. It's about the man in the closet. What about him? If we keep him without a trial doesn't that violate amedment fourteen? You mean not shall any state, deprive any person, of life, liberty or property without due process of law. That's a tough question. I guess I'd have to say that the constitution governs policies, affairs and actions of the government. And we're not the government. We're just a group of people trying to survive. What's the difference? Two pairs of socks and my feet are still freezing. Did you tell sandy to give mills full rations? We can't starve the guy. No, but we can't afford to waste extra food on the criminal. How many times do I have to remind everyone that the man's only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time? He goes back on half rations tomorrow. That's it? No discussion? It's not a debate. I thought it was a conversation. What are you doing out of bed? ...out of breath, I... I'm sitting... Why aren't you under the blanket? I was choking on my back. We can't have you freezing either. Are you having chest pain? I can't have you questioning my orders. What? You heard me. Orders? Listen to yourself you sound like... A leader? What do you want me to say? Somebody's got man up. I don't know what to say to that. Oh, fuck. Max. You have to stay put. You sound like my wife. I didn't know you were married. Widowed. Nearly twenty years now. I'm sorry. No. It was a good life. Try to get some sleep. That's not what you said three days ago. The situation was different then. Yeah, we had three days more food to keep us going out there. Where's Ethan? I'm here. What's up? We're discussing whether or not we should try to make a supply run. I thought we settled that. The circumstances have changed. Max's health is failing. I can't be sure without the proper tests but I think he has pneumonia as well as angina. I don't have any antibiotics and he's out of nitroglycerin tablets so there's nothing to treat either condition. You think we should go looking for medicine? Without it... he won't be with us much longer. So... we go? Wait, we can't sacrifice the whole group just save one person You just don't want to go. No, as a matter of fact I don't. We made a decision as a group, that staying here was our best shot at survival. I don't see how Max's condition changes anything. Abby is talking about the death sentence. I understand that. We have eight days of supplies correct? Correct. Let's lay out our options. Option one. We send one person. We tried that. Anybody heard from mark lately? Option two we send a few people. That just increases the chances of somebody talking if they get caught. It's got to be all of us. Max can't go and I won't abandon a patient. Fine, everybody but you and Max. Ethan? We can't just let him die? What about Amy? How well do you think she's going to do out there? What about the obvious choice? We stay here. We do what we can for Max and we wait for help. I think we all know that that's the the safest, most rational thing to do. He's right. We can't make this an emotional decision. The last we heard the U. N. was sending troops in through Canada. For all we know the war could already be over. Or it could go on for months. The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members. What are you a fortune cookie? How about this? The most justice can be found by doing the most good for the most people. I'm gonna go check on Max. What about the gun? What about it? If anybody leaves they're gonna need protection. The gun stays with me. And I'm not going anywhere. So what? You have the gun so you decide whether the rest of us live or die? Max left this for you. Thanks. Shall we begin? Max... well... Max was a pain in the ass. But he was our pain in the ass and often enough our conscience. Max was not shy about voicing his opinion as we all know. But he wasn't just a talker. Max believed... that our best chance... for survival lay in us remaining within these walls. So he did what he had to do to make that possible. To Max. Does anybody know a Jewish prayer for the dead? We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America. Here here. To Max. We're getting out of here. Great. Stay there. We're gonna need a map. Draw the area and anything else that might be useful. I thought you said you knew this place like the back of your hand. If we're both going you don't need a map. Draw it. Fuck off shit boy. Draw it! I said fuck off! Ah shit. I'm gonna kill you. Why couldn't you just fucking draw the map man? You're a real fucking asshole you know that. Fuck! You okay? Yeah... I was just wanting to straighten up some of Max's things. You know those aren't actually Max's things. I know. How's Amy doing? Has she said anything to you? No. She's resilient. You know before when I said somebody's gotta man up. That was harsh. Yeah. I'm sorry. Oh shit. Stop! Don't! No! How could you do that! Shit! You fucking killed him! He was going to tell the troops about the lodge. Don't look at me like that. Don't! It's not like you were going to do anything to stop him. That's not fair. Really? Name one time in this whole fucking nightmare when you put your ass on the line. One time when you've had some skin in the game. What are we gonna do? We're gonna make him disappear. One, two, three. Shit! Smoke! Cheers. To your cracker. Yeah right. Thank you. Who lit the fire? I did. What? The war is over. It's true. We heard on the radio. Free America won. The government just surrendered an hour ago. An hour ago? We're polishing off what's left of the booze. Are you okay? Mills escaped. Good for him. The war is over right. Don't move! Don't any of you make a move. You don't understand. Shut up. I can't take all of you prisoner. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Soldier! It's okay. It's okay. You don't know do you? Know what? The war is over. Yeah right. No, I'm serious. The government surrendered. We can all go home. Bullshit! Whoa! Easy, easy, easy. Just please. Listen to me. All right you've been wounded and you're not thinking straight but that's okay. I just need you to try to focus. When were you separated from your unit? Two days ago. Okay, okay that's good. And I'm guessing you followed the chimney smoke here. Am I right? So? So if the war was still on we wouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves with a fire would we? Maybe not. No. And believe me you do not want to kill anyone after the war is over. A thing like that would haunt you for the rest of your life. You don't wanna be a murder do you? I'm a soldier. Exactly. Now it's time to stand down. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. We got you. Okay. Okay. Nance. Nance. Nance. Nance. You ok?
