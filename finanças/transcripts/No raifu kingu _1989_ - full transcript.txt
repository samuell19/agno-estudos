New Century Productions Production: Shinchosha and Suntory Liquors Ltd. Sunday, July 15th. At least seven hundred people were waiting for the store to open at 10:00 AM. Some had spent the night there. It was a windy morning. We lined up at 9:30 AM, and managed to buy The Legend of Life King IV. NO LIFE KING The Legend of Life King IV The problem is... The battle has begun. It is unlikely to end as long as you are alive. I'm playing. Minoru called me just now. He said he hasn't gotten there yet. Haven't you been leveling up? That's not what I mean. Oh, sorry. Wait a second. I'm getting a call. Hello? Oh, mom? Hold on. Hello? My bad. It's my mom. I have to go. Sorry! The opening of Life King IV is cool. It's different from the rest of the series. When did you get these? Yesterday. Why didn't you show me right away? - It's hard to control your character. - Listen to what I'm saying. What's this? - It's from cram school. - "Guidance counseling". "Fourth graders and above only..." Shall we try it? I don't want to. Why not? We should go, don't you think so? How about enrolling in a summer course? I'll do that. - When? - Tomorrow. - At your cram school? - Yes. Don't spend too much time on the phone, all right? Okay... This is Makoto Osawa. I'm not at home right now. Don't hesitate to leave your message after the beep. This is Katsuya Muroi. I heard a crazy rumor that some copies of Life King IV are cursed. I'll see you later. Kuromiyama Elementary School, Tokyo They say the devil himself created it. - And if you lose, you're dead. - That would be so intense to play. My brother and I each bought our own copy of Life King IV. That's bad! I wonder if my copy is all right... - I bet yours is cursed. - No way! How do you know if it's cursed or not? What's going to happen to me if it is? The cursed Life King IV is called No Life King. No Life King? They say you can't tell the difference between it and Life King IV. There's one guy who had a perfect run through the final labyrinth of darkness. Really? That's awesome! But right after the game ended, he had a heart attack and started puking blood. What?! We don't know whether our copies are cursed or not. You can't tell the difference between Life King IV and No Life King. - So, what can we do? - Nothing. Okay, double-file towards the right please. Who's gonna be able to beat an impossible game? Someone will. Kids who get bullied will be the first to die, 'cause they're weak. We don't even know who's spreading the curse. Attention, please. Teachers, please come to the front. Please, stand up. We will now begin the closing ceremony for the first semester. Raise the flag. Turn to face the flag. Please, turn around. And now, your principal will give a speech. Good morning, everyone! - Good morning! - Good morning! I see you're all in good spirits. A long, long summer holiday begins tomorrow. Be sure to do something productive. That aside, just this morning, I was reading the newspaper. Newspapers have a section called the editorial page... Do you all know what that is? It's a section in your newspaper that says, "This is what I think." That's what an editorial is. This is what it said. Little kids just like you are crazy about... are crazy about... The problem is... The problem is... video games... - Are you all right? - Principal... Call an ambulance! He died just like in the game. Life King IV is bad news. The rumors about No Life King are true. I'm scared. - When does your summer course start? - August 1st, I think. All right. Do your best, okay? Let's see, what should we have for dinner? Today, during school... Never mind. Should we order some food? Makoto, what would you like? Meat musubi. How about noodles or rice? All right, anything's fine. Call me when the food arrives. I'll be in my room. Don't just play games. Finish up your homework. - I keep getting doubles. - Wait, I'll take it! - Hooray! - I'll take it. Minoru! He's dead. Go Miyakawa, the actor who played Pris Man. No way! Go Miyakawa who played Pris Man... He's really dead. I just watched Pris Man. That was his ghost. You don't have to believe it. It's still true. If you have a Pris Eraser, you're cursed. Your bones dissolve from the inside. Then, you die, you know? - Exactly! - That's a lie. When he died, he transferred his pain into the Pris Erasers. If you have one, you're in big trouble. - What's her name? - Noriko Kamei. I'm in love with her. Nobuhiko Mizuta Mr. Mizuta? I'm Mori's assistant. I'd like to speak with you about the principal's death. - Mr. Ota, excuse me. - Hold on. Here are the totals for each class. Sudden Death of Elementary School Principal That's fine for the school year. Principal Suddenly Dies at School Closing Ceremony Can you tell me what happened? July 8th. 09:16 AM. He died of a stroke. That's all we know. But you have to crouch when you're inside Yggdrasil. That's right. You can't go back while you're crouching. When you crouch facing right, you hold down and right while pressing the B button. If you do that, you can change directions while charging. Use your blaster to defeat Audumla, then use three capsules to generate a barrier. If the barrier is about to break once you enter stage six, take one of the capsules and keep pressing the A button. That way, the barrier will regenerate for a moment. Otherwise, your barrier will be in bad shape on stage six. There's no way Pris Man is dead. That story is so fake. Mochizuki's always making stuff up. Why is he like that? He's got family problems, right? What are you doing today? I wonder. Are you going to play Life King? - No. - Me neither. What, then? ♪ Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda... ♪ Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda... - Should we eat out? - Okay... By the way... There's a girl called Noriko Kamei in your class, right? - Yes. - Her parents run a bakery. People are saying their cakes are dangerous. Dangerous? I heard people have been getting food poisoning. The neighbors are talking about it. It might sound crazy, but they said Kamei's house was built on top of an old cemetery. What an awful rumor. Oh, it's dad. It's dad... - Dad! - Dad! I understand. If you excuse me now, goodbye. - I'm back. - You came in through the shop again. - How's mother? - No word yet. I see. Minagawa and my brother are really close. - Welcome home. - I'm back! - Makoto, long time no see. - Hello. - I'm here. - Welcome. It's so hard... Wanna try? No. I want to see Satoru's techniques first. - You brought melon? - Yes. Can I put it here? Be careful. - I'm sorry. - Is the baby coming soon? Not yet, but I'm going to the hospital later. I hope it won't be much longer. - Thank you for the meal! - Thank you for the meal! Which is better? A little brother or a sister? Both are fine. Either a sister or a brother. We're going back to the definitions. You learned this before summer break. You can't keep struggling with the fundamentals. If you don't understand, you can have a hint. If you've already finished the multiplication and division problems, try solving this one. I'm sending it now. It's from a middle school entrance exam. Most fifth graders don't know how to solve it, but you should be able to. Yoshiyuki Yamanaka from Stonehenge has a cursed guitar. It started bleeding during a concert. A policeman from Sakai Street got drunk, and went around killing the neighborhood puppies. If you listen to Kumiko Honjo's radio show, one of your friends or relatives will die the next day. Beware of transfer students without shadows. When the sun sets, their eyes light up, they'll suck your blood and kill you. If you're carry a photo of The Cookies, you will be kidnapped and your nails will be torn out. If you see the commercial with the Pomeranian puppy four times in one day, you'll die three months later. The Dog Man from Kararia Adventures is cursed. Rumors say you'll die if you watch it. Nomura's mom took his cat, put it in the microwave, and cooked it to death. In The Cherries' new single, Ryoko, the member who committed suicide, can be heard yelling, "Help!" If you see an old lady with one completely black eye, you'll die within three days. In the scene where the main character is riding a taxi at night, you can see the reflection of a dead crew member in the window. If you see it, you'll get a fever, and die within four days. There's worm meat in the Prince Burger. They say their warehouse is full of worms. If you eat a birthday cake from Mangetsu-do, you'll wake up paralyzed when you sleep. A worker at the Asahiya bread factory died. His rotten body was found inside a tank. They say a child's finger was found in the ham at Toumaru Supermarket. If you eat Meisei cup noodles, your body will be covered with scales. A white snake will crawl out of you and you'll die. Osato, have you finished the multiplication section? I'm looking at your screen. How many problems did you miss? You missed two. That's a lot. Please bring up the hint screen. What is it? If you have a question, just press the help key. Get a good night's sleep. You can go home. I'm leaving. You're from Kuromiyama Elementary School, aren't you? The school where the principal died during a ceremony. Can you tell me what happened? Anything would be helpful. Fujimaru's custom microphone contains a hex... If you see a Puchi Jeanne doll dancing at night, you'll die. If the late-night weather report shows the same number of sun and rain symbols, a child will die in a car accident the next day. - Why are you taking my picture? - I'm sorry. You know a lot about this. Just a bunch of nasty rumors. What's going on with kids these days? Is this what you came here to ask me about, mister? Because of kids' rumors, cross-promotional events have been postponed, ratings have dropped to one sixth of what they used to be, and imports have been canceled. Stories like that are pouring in one after another. You don't believe any of it, do you? Kids are really something. Do you know what these are? Pris Erasers. Kids are afraid that they're cursed. Everyone gives them to me. I wonder what's going on with kids these days? - Do you play Life King IV? - No. - What does "No Life" mean? - Something without life, no? The universe is huge, so it takes a long time for starlight to reach the Earth. Some of the stars we can see have already died. We see light from stars that no longer exist. You better believe me! You'd better throw away your Pris Eraser. What are you going to do if you get cursed? Your blood will turn black, and, then, you'll die. Kids are getting sick one after another. Hey. These, too. Hurry up. Lighter! Come here, hurry up. Hurry up! Or do you want to get cursed? Quick! Do you really want to get cursed? Minoru is absent today... It's your fault if he's dead. Apologize to everyone. Looks like it was true. It was in the weekly paper. Minoru... Did he get rid of his Pris Eraser? Of course! They're cursed. Then, why wasn't he at the pool? Let's call him. We should. Is the number busy? It's ringing, but he's not picking up. - Still nothing? - Still nothing. He isn't dead, is he? Minoru? Minoru? Yes... Got it. He's alive... What's wrong with you guys? - Oh, so that's what happened! - What? What is it? Minoru skipped the pool because his grandpa's sick. So, that's why! Hello? Hello? Yes... Huh? What? Can we come by? The day before yesterday was rough. They said he might die. I'm supposed to stay at home, so grandpa can see me before he dies. Do you want to see him? These are my friends. - Sorry to bother you. - Hello. They all said he wouldn't make it. But, then, he got better? He said he had a dream about driving away demons. Grandpa said, "I'm fine. As long as I'm not dead, I'll keep living". - Keep living as long as he's not dead? - That's obvious! Minoru, we were worried you didn't come. Mochizuki even said, "It's your fault if he's dead". I'll get rid of my Pris Erasers. - Wow. - Amazing. I made up my mind to throw them away. They're cursed, after all. That's enough. "The Pris Erasers died so we can live on". "But they all went to heaven, and that's good". "The curse is probably lifted when they get to heaven". "The end". It's over now. Brother! There's nothing to be afraid of. Brother, don't be scared, okay? I was just playing Life King IV again. Life King IV? The enemies are too strong, and I just keep dying. It's crazy. - Has anyone even finished it? - No way. I haven't said anything about how the rumors should be dealt with. The rumors circulating among children all center around death. Japanese children don't have a sense for the deaths of individuals, but, instead, they may be feeling a larger collective death. In other words, a lifestyle is emerging that encompasses living and dying at the same time. It's important for kids to understand this and adapt to it. It's one of the steps for new children to become new adults.

Yota Koyama There was a family cursed by No Life King, and they all committed suicide. [Yukio Tanaka] They say you'll die if the curse isn't lifted. My mother took my Life King IV cartridge away, and I can't lift the curse. Our store went under, and dad beats my mom every day. Someone please defeat No Life King! There's a kid that couldn't break the curse and committed suicide. [Yuji Saeki] Cursed copies of Life King IV are called... If anyone can get to the ending, the curse will be broken. How's Tokyo? Makoto Osawa I'm Makoto Osawa from West Tokyo. It's scary, but... - Hello! - Hello. ...we'll die... How are you today? ...if we can't break the curse... Did you practice in summer? ...so I'll do my best. I'm inserting the disc. It's scary, but we'll die if we can't break the curse. So, I'll do my best. Looks like everyone is present today. Summer classes are quite important. Today, we'll continue with the task from last Friday. But, before that, let's see how you're feeling. - Yes. - Yes. Great / Very Good / Good / Not Very Good / Bad Wait, wait. Excuse me, just a second. Mizuta! I thought I saw a familiar face. What a coincidence! I want to ask you a favor. You work for Akiyuki Mori, right? Can you put me in touch with him? - I'll have coffee. - Yes. Where's Mr. Mori? I want to interview him for my magazine. - I don't know. - Here you go again. Mizuta, everyone is at their wits' ends. Diet member Kenjiro Koda has resigned, all over something so trivial. Construction got delayed at Kanda Station, too. Then, there's Sakae-ya in Funabashi. Right after re-opening... If that's all you know, Mori won't have anything to tell you. Isn't Mori the one setting the media narrative? Maybe that's why he's been hiding. A lot of people have their sights set on him. Rumors. Just rumors. Japan's first end-of-the-century produces nothing but rumors. Those rumors... This is what gave birth to them. The cursed game, No Life King. If you can't lift the curse, you die. People are pushing for it to be banned. All that does is bring more attention to it. The problem is not video games. Did Mori say that? There's no such thing in this world as a cursed game called No Life King. Tens of thousands of copies of Life King IV have been sold. Someone's going to beat it for sure. That's not the problem. Cursed Pris Erasers. You can have them. We'll be in trouble if our parents find out. Even if I explain, they won't believe they're going to die. What is this? Half Life. When Life King is fighting in the labyrinth of darkness, his damaged body parts turn into little Life Kings. What's this? The Wiseman's stone. The Wiseman's stone? Half Life leaves it behind when he self-destructs. That's the Wiseman's stone. "Mother. Melon. Flute. Forest. Full moon". Those are the things that Half Life loved. So, no one will forget that Half Life was here. Osawa Makoto. 10 years old. AB+ blood type. Height: 139,7 cm. Weight: 29,2 kg. I was born a little earlier than normal. Asunaro-kai West Tokyo Branch.

Makoto, if you don't break the curse, we're really going to die. - Do your best and lift the curse. - We beg you! - Do your best! - Please, lift it! It's scary.

Give me back my New Famicon. - I'm finished. Thanks for the meal. - Makoto! It's going to make me really sad if you start acting strange. Don't go too far. I'm asking you. Makoto... Then, tell me... What would you do... What would you do if I died? If you died? You aren't going to die. You're young. Me, I'm going to live to a hundred. And you'll be around after that. For everyone's sake, please break the curse. Good luck! Do your best! We're counting on you. Do your best. Sapporo Branch Chat [Yota Koyama] Makoto, can you keep doing your best? [Makoto Osawa] It's simple to do your best. I'm always doing my best. Hello. Hello... How is everyone today? - Number 201, Chikako Togawa. - Yes? Please wait a moment. He can get into the better mid-ranked private schools. The better mid-ranked schools? The rest depends on him. There's still enough time, if he does his best. The low, or even the middle range of top-ranked schools could be within reach. Makoto. If you really go for it, I know your grades can turn around next semester. Can you promise that to me? Can you promise to try hard and raise your test scores by 20 points each? I promise. Do your best and show us what you're capable of. I will do my best. I can tell that Makoto has determination. Makoto! You're Makoto Osawa, aren't you? Yes. Nice to meet you. I'm Nobuhiko Mizuta. This is Mr. Akiyuki Mori. Hello! Hello. Good evening. You must be wondering who we are. We're trend seekers. Never heard of us, huh? Lately, we've just been researching rumors. You see, Mori often says this, although I don't really know what it means. "In order for new children to become new adults," "children must face new trials". Have you heard that phrase? What was it? "Look towards the new real". I've read those words so many times, I memorized them. Is the new real something you can benefit from? I don't know. That guy, Mori, has got a big head, huh? No Life King, right? You brought No Life King, didn't you? Aren't you scared? It's scary, but we'll die if we can't break the curse. See you. Could you break the curse faster with help from your friends? Could you break the curse faster with help from your friends? What's this? Hello, this is Chisui. Yes... Hold on a second, will you? Your friends are on line one. Yes? Akira and Satoru, do your best to beat No Life King. - We're begging you. - We're begging you. It's them again. Minoru, I'm going to the hospital with grandpa, understand? Hello, this is Kajima-ya. Makoto Osawa? He's my friend. Input Text: "Real" Please wait... Makoto Osawa can't beat No Life King alone. He teamed up with his friends. Did you hear? There are five of them. I heard there's a legendary gamer at Kuromiyama Elementary. His name is Satoru Nakamura. He doesn't talk much, right? They're all working together to lift the curse of Life King IV. No Life King? [Makoto Osawa] To Yota Koyama from Hokkaido What should I do? It's me. I'm alive. I didn't die. Come visit me today. You can see Masaru. Masaru is my younger brother. - He was born very slowly. - Slowly? - The doctor said so, too. - You never know how it'll go, I suppose. Welcome. - Hello. - Hi. Can I show Masaru to them? So, this is him. He's awake. He's looking this way. We don't know if he can see yet. He can definitely see. He's looking at me. His hands are so tiny. He's not crying. There's nothing to cry about. Makoto, bring in the laundry from the balcony, all right? I'll do my best. [Yota Koyama] Makoto, go outside and look around. Is it... real? Makoto, go outside and look around. Is it real? Do your best, Makoto. Makoto, please do your best. It's all real. Do your best, Makoto. The curse of No Life King. Did you finish Life King IV? I did. So did I. Me, too. What's your level? 47. 46. Ours is 35. Mine is 47. My grandpa died. Yesterday... He kept living until he was dead.
