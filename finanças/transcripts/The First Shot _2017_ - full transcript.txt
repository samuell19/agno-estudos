2019 Seoul Webfest Grand Winner 1993 Tteokbokki, please. Tteokbokki, please. Your Super Powers What do you need, kid? Ramyeon, please. It's a ramyeon house. But with a soft-boiled egg. What egg? You should put an egg at the last moment. Don't flip the egg. Serve it right before the yolk is fully cooked. How do you want it cooked? Can you repeat that? Yeah. Bon appetit! Welcome. Hey, take these. Sir, the Jongno guys want to see us at Sejong Hotel after an hour. Things have gotten worse than expected. How bad is it? Kim Sam Sik of Myeongdong, Choi Doo Chan of Ulgiro, and Huh Sam Soo of Jonggak. They all got split. Lunch, first. - Auntie. Six rice soup here. - Yes? Wait. Sir? What is that kid eating? What is this? One more each? Soju, Sir? Order it! Order it! Sir, the head office's coming to check this afternoon. The Jongno guys are waiting, Sir. Forget it. Forget it. Let's ditch them. Ditch! Soju, here! Hey, hey! Hold on! Dig it! Bury it! Stomp it! Double-check! My palate just woke up at that time. A new world came to me, and my delicate palate pleased me and everybody. I thought life would bring me all possibilities and accomplishments like that. But it didn't take long to realize that the world is not that easy. Auntie, it's me. Who? Congratulations! I ordered soft-boiled... What are you talking about? See the line here. Wait in line, please. Auntie, the other day... Who is this kid? Hey! Line up! Don't you see all the other adults lining up here? What's wrong? What? Babe, what's going on, huh? No need to step in, gorgeous. Kid, wait in line or this man will punish you. Okay? Hey, little guy. What? Want to say something? Get rid of him. Go to your mom. Hey, go home. It can be said to be a revolution in the snack industry. The Ramyeon House once struggled with an annual sales of five million won, as you can see, this place is packed with customers. This 33-square-meter store is selling more than 300 bowls at lunchtime on average. The rumor has it that the owner got many offers from big franchise companies. The offer will be at least billions of won and the store will move to Myeongdong, the former site of Hanil Bank. I have been waiting in line for two hours myself but I'm still not sure about when I'll get in. Mister, you're doing it wrong. Stir it left twice, then right three times. Stir it left twice, then right three times? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Delicious. Who did you pick? Kang Suzy. How about her? Well. You? I picked Kim Hee Sun. How about her? Well. And you? Me? Yeon Joo. Yes. As always. My precious ones have gone to others before I call their names. Even a dog. Like that. Mostly-deprived. Single. Mid-30s. I became a salesperson of a pharmaceutical company. A veteran of the sales division, Kim Min Sik. My boss. The youngest head of the sales division. Leader of Team 2, Kang Ji Hyeon. Loves soju-beer bomb shots. You scared me. The ace of Team 3, Kim Hyeon Woo. My dear fellow. Yes, Mom. I told you not to do a night shift. Are you okay? Take care of yourself! Dinner? I'm going to. Kimchi? Huh? Kimchi? What kimchi? Radish? Ah, radish! Still some left. I don't eat it every day. I'm not a cow. Mom, another call is coming in. Don't skip dinner! Yes. Bye. And Assistant Manager Kim Seo Yeon. I haven't spoken to her yet. Who the hell is he? Hello, Senior. Really? Good night. The main office? Planning Department? You were eager to go there! Yeah, it happened. You have to drink this. Drink. Drink! Then, can I stop making new credit cards for you? Look at this! For your own good. - Have a drink. - Okay. Wow. Great salmon today. Oh, this is my cousin. My uncle's son. This is Ji Hoon. We went to the same university. Cousin? I kept this for a special occasion. - Wow. - Here. 30-year-old. Fu... Sto... p. Oh, yes. My beautiful aunt is doing well? Yeah, yeah. Help yourself. Great salmon today. Thank you. He looks scary but has a warm heart. His philosophy on food is the real deal. As he says, every single food has its own texture. Just like people, every single food has its own characteristics. And it can taste different depending on how you cut it. It is the knife that matters. You need to use different knives for different foods. The way you sharpen it is also different. Who uses the knife or who cooks it is the most important part. What kind of mind the person has. That makes the difference. Well, Ho Yeon. To you, I wanted to give it in person. What is this? Look inside. Oh. That? More to celebrate. Seoâ€¦ Seo Ji Hye? You are here. Ho Yeon, you know her. Hi? Babe, did you have dinner? The one who shared my 20s, my Ji Hye. You like whiskey, right? It happened, Ho Yeon. Yes, yes. It's our reunion, so... Ho Yeon, give a toast. A toast... to us! Great! It reminds us of old times, right? She has gone. I have to remove her. Son, are you asleep? Yes, are you going home? Yes. Finished early so had ramyeon with some fellows. Why are you awake, son? I was half asleep. Okay, is everything all right? Nothing. I'm worried that you always give yours to others. Not anymore. I'm old enough to know better. The bus is here. Sweet dreams, Lee Ho Yeon! But still... there is someone on my side. Good night. Good morning. Yes... Goo-Good morning. Gosh, come on! I'll call maintenance. The bottle! Bottle, the bottle! Oh, what a workout! It's working now. So refreshing. Thank you, Lee. So... you haven't met Prof. Gook yet? Darn! Okay. Good job. I'll tell the president later. Do you need help? Oh, no, Ma'am. Ah... I feel much better. Did you jog here? You look pale. Ah, no. I drank a lot last night. You didn't drink that much at the dinner with us. - Morning! - Mr. President. I just need some water before the meeting. Let me! I'm good. Ho Yeon, did you drink last night? You look like you gained some weight. Or just puffy. No, Sir! It's okay. You are still young. I'm jealous. By the way, do you know any decent curry place? I'm into it recently. Oh, you mean Indian or Japanese? Japanese. Then, there is "Abicco" across the Kyobo building, towards the post office. An old man, who made curry in Myeongdong for 30 years, he's running that place. There are 3 kinds of curry, 2 curry pasta, 1 hayashi-rice. You can choose from five spicy levels, starting with the baby step to the master level. Good thing I asked. And any recommendations? What's the occasion, Sir? Oh, with my wife. At my age, wife means everything. You should find your own girl. No need to hurry, but there's no harm in getting married. Yes, Sir. If you're going with your wife, how about getting one beef curry and one mushroom cream curry pasta and sharing it? And baby-step each. It seemed like you had trouble eating spicy food. Good! Good. Text me what you've just said. Yes, Sir. Keep it up, you both! Don't fight. Yes, Sir! Incredible! Are you working out, Mr. Lee? Yes! I should. At my age. No girlfriend. To survive. - By the way... - Excuse me, just... Please, give it to me. Let me do that. It's heavy. Thank you. Mr. President! Yes! Please, go ahead. Late in the evening? Great, great! Yes, then I'll make a reservation. So... Are you doing well, the pants wetter? Are you an assistant manager or a manager now? I'm a manager, Sir. Manager. It's been almost 10 years since I joined this company. Is that so? So, now you tidy up our own nappy? Former president, who hired me when I was a college student. My drinking buddy and mentor. Ah, Sir! Please. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Who's taking care of Prof. Gook now? Ms. Kang's team is working on it. You know, Sir. It's not easy. You know? You little. Good evening, Mr. President. Not a president. I'm just an old man now. Does your youngest boy go to middle school this year? Yes. Thanks to you. Don't mention it. It's nothing. Go with your kids this weekend. Thank you, Sir. I'll prepare the usual. This "gonowada..." Do you know what it means? You made a reservation here, not knowing what this is. It is the gut of a sea cucumber. Being fresh isn't enough. It has to harmonize with the texture of halibut, and the temperature of the sea cucumber's gut. Temperature is critical for the chemistry of the two. It looks delicious, Sir. You only care about eating. Here, take this. Wow! - It's fantastic! - Not bad, huh? This is why I always answer your call right away. - What about me? - Oh, right. The best one for you. That's enough. Yes, Sir. Eat when you drink. Many people around me, who drank without food, they were all screwed. You can drink until my age if you drink with good food. Yummy. It is quite different from my old days of how people lived. It's great. Everyone has something they want to do. But you must remember that the work you are doing now is what you were eager to do. How much effort did you put into this job? Don't forget about that. Everybody talks about work-life balance, and it's good. But your life after work should not be an escape. Don't escape to a mountain or a golf field every weekend. Push yourself to the limit. But enjoy it. Do you know why I buy you dinner? Because I'm good-looking? Because you eat food with delight. Do you know why I buy you drinks? To do good work. - Sir? - Do well. Doing your best isn't enough. Do well. Don't give what you've earned to others. Do your own job well. Do all the things you want. Yes, Sir. And you should have guts. You'll be a wonderful salesman with that one thing. Also, you should care about only yourself sometimes. Even though I call you, if a pretty girl asks you out, just go there. But... You. Yes, Sir! Long speech again. Open your wallet, shut your mouth. Sir... you'll keep your wallet opened for me? Is it yours? Where's the drink? Busy? Oh. Yes. Cheers. Thank you for dinner, Sir. When a soldier goes into battle, he needs to arm himself in combat gear. A necktie is a weapon for a man. It's yours from now on. Be gentle. It's an expensive one. Giving your time and affection is like commitment and sacrifice. Like giving some of mine to another person, such as an expensive silk tie. From that day, I go to work wearing the tie he gave me. The curious thing is that the pattern of the tie changes every day. But it doesn't matter. I, who once was timid and unsure of myself, get more and more confident. Good morning, Mr. Lee. Beautiful morning, Mr. Lee! Morning. What's that? 14 swords were needed to kill Caesar. But those swords were defeated by the speech of Marc Antony. The cloth which covered Marc Antony's neck for protection is the origin of a necktie. Oh! Love your fellow! Lov... Shit! I swallowed it. Love your fellow, love your country. Always together in the men's room. You don't like it? Hyeon Woo, handsome dear. Want a hug? It's gross! Hey! Don't throw trash on the floor. My fellows. Did anyone get GK's offer? Not me. Me? No way! Anyway. Anyway, don't let me hear the news from elsewhere. By the way, people are talking about inside recruiting. Inside recruiting. Important. We, the North branch, set a goal of 15% year on year growth. Focusing on propranolol which was launched last year, the following are the people in charge. We, South branch team 3, will do more aggressive sales of newly launched Fresubin protein drink. I'll report to you the issues, focusing on Samjung Hospital. We reached more than 35% compared to last year, based on the KPI. West branch has no significant change in the market except for university hospitals. But there will be a shift in doctors, so we need to reorganize the team including a replacement. Keeping Prof. Gook? He got a promotion as the chief of the Department of Psychiatry. He is tricky, isn't he? Professor Gook. Only the ace can handle. So you need a new player? I wrote a thesis on psychiatry, but can I get a chance? We are short of hands and need to build up a new strategy. How about insider promotion? Um... I'll report all of this to you separately. Right. Talk to me later. You're all doing well and I appreciate that. But the company is not simple. It may not be easy. If you can't fit in this company, you should go somewhere else. Right? Inside recruiting is a rare case, so discuss it with your team. Don't be shy. Okay? Can I get it? Good morning, my son. Are you awake? Every joint is screaming. My body aches all over. Not coming home? It's a holiday. Very small amount of water. Put noodle and powder together and boil it. If water boils, put half a glass of cold water and boil again. Stir noodles to contact the air. When it boils, put water and boil again. And again. You should have the guts. You'll be a wonderful salesman with that one thing. Believe in yourself. Did you jog here? Are you working out, Mr. Lee? Are you working out, Mr. Lee? Are you working out, Mr. Lee? You are working out. Huh? What? What do you mean what? What are you doing here alone? Breathing. Working out to survive. You? We just finished our club gathering. Coffee dripping? Yes. Dripping. I see. I see. Our ace, Hyeon Woo. Sunlight. GK is recruiting aggressively. Paying double. You got an offer? No. I'll keep my position. Right? I'm thinking about handling Prof. Gook. There will be reshuffling. Yeah, right. I'm sure you can. Hey. Are you guys close? I told you, the coffee club. Right, dripping. Are you into Seo Yeon? Do you call her by her first name? Why? Good. Who cares. You can talk casually. It's not a working day. Hey, you'd better call me "big brother" out of the office. All right, Big Brother. Shall we have a drink? What would you like? The eldest will buy us drinks. Iced Americano, please. Is there slushy ice? To burn fat, I'll take hot Americano. And Ms. Kim... Seo Yeon? I... need sugar, so iced Cafe Mocca? But it's probably not here. Seo Yeon, that's too... No. Everything is possible in Korea. I'll take a Cappuccino. Americano with slushy ice for Heezee. Thank you. Wow. It's really slushy. Iced Cafe Mocca for Ms. Seo Yeon. Thank you. And... the last. Our ace. Americano, hot. Thank you for the drink. See you tomorrow. I was busy, busy. Today? It was a great day. So... apply it if you have something in mind. But with determination. Is there anyone in our team? Who knows. All of you are the infamous traitors anyway. Lee? Which Lee, Sir? Lee is Lee Jung Eun. Ho Yeon is just Ho Yeon. At your service, Sir. At... your service. Thank you that I'm given two Lees with whole different loyalty, Amen. Sun Woo? No way, Sir. Kang is so eager to bring people into her team. And it won't be the newbie. No, Sir. Give me a break. I am a "Gireogi" now. My wife and kids are gone and if you guys leave... I think she'll take Hyeon Woo from Team 3. She'll need an immediate backup. Otherwise, Il Hyeon or Nam Jun will get promoted. So, you mean not you? What do you want for lunch, Sir? By the way, Ho Yeon's tie has been looking nice, lately. You don't have to wear a tie when it's hot. Isn't it hot? When a soldier goes into battle, he needs to arm himself in combat gear. Got it. The company wants to get applicants who are inclined to move. Any traitor should be prepared before reporting to me. Dismissed. Choi, what's for lunch? You drank yesterday, so spicy pork stew? Master's idea? Let's go! Oh, Kang. - Do you have an appointment? - Sure. With my guys. You old man. They hate that. Have lunch with me. I'm going to eat pork stew. I'll buy you pufferfish stew. - Lunartail? - Fresh puffer. Come with me, Ma'am. You must have drunk a lot. Hey, hey! Not spicy stew. Pasta. Let's eat pasta! Thank you. It's tonight, right? So nice. If you don't feel well, take some medicine. Not a drink. My insomnia got worse. Hey, drug seller. Is there any good medicine? Why don't you sell it to me? Or I'll recommend a doctor, so go see a doctor and get a prescription. - Deal! - Deal. - Bottoms up! - Up. Do you have to move to another branch if you guys get married? Ridiculous. He's the one who should move. I'll build more of a career in the foreign exchange department. That's my girl! I hope you are happy. You too. Are you okay? You won't cry at my wedding, will you? Drink. Drink. I waited for you here at that time. Here? Yes. Here. At the end of the semester. At the end of the semester. You didn't show up. You crazy. Hey, lady. Watch your language, new bride. You are crazy. Hey. You didn't show up. YOU, didn't show up. I waited for forever. Just leave it here, please. Thank you. Back then, you told me that you'd be here at eight. Yes, six... eight? You were always like that. You always blow your chance. Ho Yeon, thank you for taking care of my girl. Have fun. Mix coffee man! Mr. Lee? Bottoms up! Oops! Napkin! Napkin! Listen carefully. Carefully. Chum churum or chamisul. Chum churum! What's this? What's happening? Spicy noodle or soy-sauce noodle! Soy-sauce! Spring onion kimchi or gat kimchi! Gat kimchi! Thank you! I figured life is a gift. And I don't intend on wasting it. I figured life is a gift. And I don't intend on wasting it. The good old days have gone, and a new day has come before I know it. give Are you busy, Babe? Today, Ma'am? Yes, today. Let's have dinner with me and Song. Good? Good? Good? Colleague Colleague Welcome. Welcome. Colleague Come on in. Teach me a lesson, Ms. Kang. No need. Teach me a lesson. Wow! I like zucchini savory pancake. Delicious. Take this, Sir. I'm good. Take it. You don't like zucchini? I can't eat zucchini. I can't eat my own kind. Have it, handsome. What? You are handsome. Am I? I'll mix it up for you. More, more. It's too much. I'll do it in our way. Love Lee Ho Yeon! It feels fantastic! Great. I love you so much, bro! Dong Hwan, are you expecting a promotion this year? - No, Sir. I got two more years. - Two years? But you already look like a senior manager. It has been like that for long. Mr. Song, we're always careful around you. Don't tease me, please. Hey, Mr. Lee! Give me your glass. I'll make a wonderful blend. More soju. - Help yourself. - Thank you. Look at this. So plump, right? Color, sentiment, and mood. I'll take the Arabesque greenling first. - Please. - Take a bite. I'll take the bones out. Time has made this. Delicious. Delicious. By the way, Ma'am. I thought you had something to say. Nothing private. Just have a drink and chill out. I thought... Prof. Gook, can you handle him? You mean from psychiatry? Yes. Is there another Prof. Gook? Me? You heard me. Do I have to repeat it? Ma'am, you know me. It's outside my capabilities. Why? I think you are the right person. Mr. Park seems to be quite good at it. No way. He is barely holding on. - And he'll leave soon. - He's leaving? Yes. He got an offer from GK. Great contract. So, you just let him go? He has his own life. I can't stop him. I told him the sooner the better. My fellows... let's drink. You should take it. No one but Lee Ho Yeon can do better than Park Doo Sik in this field. Anyway. For now, focus on eating and drinking. - Got it? - Got it. - Let's drink. - Let's drink. I feel so good! Mr. Lee, let's go to karaoke. You can sit in the back seat, Ma'am. No. You can take it. Ho Yeon, it'll be twenty years after a few more years. You know it's not easy for a woman to work in pharmaceuticals in Korea. Yes, sure. You know? A bit. A little bit. I never sit in the back seat together. And fortunately, all of my mentors let me take the back seat and they sat in the front. The seat doesn't matter but... Lee Ho Yeon, you have many talents. I can see them. You should see them yourself. You think so? What do you worry about? Honestly, I still don't know what to talk about with doctors. You mean the product? Yes. They were approved over ten years ago, so there is nothing new about our products. So? I can't talk about the weather or golf anymore. That's pathetic. I'm sorry. Let's think about that. You and I, everyone in this jungle, should keep going; overcoming our own issues. I don't mean that I should wear a short skirt, and you should treat doctors at a hostess bar. Also, you have to use your super power. No need to save it. Right. I'm not sure yet. But, sales, work... It is all about people and winning the hearts of people. I can see your heart; warmth. Stop around the corner, right? Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, Senior Kang Ji Hyeon. - Good morning. - Good morning. Go, Mr. Lee! Good morning, Mr. Lee. Hey, Ho Yeon, morning. See you in the meeting. Take these. The report you asked me about yesterday. What's going on? The ticket you mentioned. How did you get it? Best for a hangover. Thank you. Sir. Danke schÃ¶n! Take care of yourself. - You better not. - You better not. You better not. Yes, Mr. President. What are you doing tomorrow? I have a product presentation and workshop tomorrow. How about next week, Sir? Never mind. Get back to work. Sorry, Sir. No need. Work first. Don't forget to eat when you drink. Yes, Sir. Let me mix it up. Is your mother okay? Yes. Thanks to you. Take care of your parents. They tend to collapse all of a sudden, especially when seasons change. Yes. My uncle was healthy. But one day, he just... Just? He just didn't get up in the morning. Right. My mom and dad passed away one after another the year before last. So there is no applicant for inside recruiting in my team? I think... If you can't take the heat, you should get out of the kitchen. - But if you don't like the chef... - Bear it. Yes, bear it. And that chef is about to fall... Ouch! My neck! And now he's gone. You traitor! Are you sure, Ms. Choi? By the way, Ms. Kang is more thoughtful than I had expected. I thought she was going to keep it confidential. She took Hyeon Woo to another bar to close the deal right now. No, no. She left early today. And Hyeon Woo went to Itaewon with his assistant managers. That handsome one? With Seo Yeon? Bingo! Mr. Lee, give me your glass. Make it strong. It's too bland. What a temper! You mean, strong enough to wet your pants? Gosh. You still wet your pants? No more wetting! No more. Anyway. All of you, thank you for staying with me in this situation. I'm not the only one who thinks we have good teamwork here, right? - You're right, Sir. - Yes. Steadily. Let's keep it slow. And Ho Yeon, I mean you, long sight. Yes. You're seeing the bigger picture better than Hyeon Woo. Cheer up! Let's go up! - Cheer up! - Let's go up! Go up! All glasses. - I'll mix up for you. - Ho Yeon! Yes, Uncle. Where are you now? Your mom is sick. She is sick! Mom? Where are you? She's going to die! Uncle! I can't hear you. Explain... Hello? Uncle! Mr. Kim, can I borrow your car? Call a driver. Driver. Ho Yeon! Ho Yeon! Where are you! Your mom is sick! She's sick. Mom. Please. Please. Where are you? She's going to die! - Take care of your parents. - Mom, please. They tend to collapse all of a sudden, especially when seasons change. Come on! He just didn't get up in the morning. Pick up the phone, Hye Jung. Son, are you asleep? Yes, I finished early so I had ramyeon with my fellows. Why are you awake, son? Okay, is everything all right? I'm worried that you always give yours to others. Are we there yet? Every joint is screaming. - Son, my body aches. - I'm sorry, but can you drive faster? - Aren't you coming home? - Faster, please. Mom! Uncle, where is Mom? Mom!! - Son! - Cousin! My cousin! What? - Are you guys still seeing each other? - Yes. Son. Your son? Son? All grown-up? Whose son? That's Ho Yeon. Ho Yeon! Your mother is looking for you. She's looking... - Come on! - Dad! Mom! Stop yelling. Come over here and have a drink! Let's have a drink. What brings you here this early? Who called him? Won't you come here quick? Are you guys not coming to Seoul? Didn't your father tell you to go to Seoul? Why? I love this place so much. Is that so? How have you been, Yoon Ho? Can you support her? Hey! I'm making good money. I launched Jung's chicken pop second store. Really? Yes. She's earning a fortune. In my humble opinion, it's way more than regular salary in Seoul. And you? I'm the boss of the second store! Boss? Absurd! You're just an employee. Don't you dare to bleed her dry! My smart cousin, did you think the people around here would just stay in their houses after you went to Seoul? Your mom can live without you, but not without me. Screw the first son! I'll claim all the inheritance! Sure. It's all yours. - A little. - You have some though. Are you Lee Ho Yeon? Yes. Yes, Sir. I'm Yeon Joo's father. Do you remember? You don't remember her? Oh... Sir! Yeon Joo? You know Ho Yeon, the one who went to Seoul. Okay. What's up with your hair? I heard you are on a roll. Come to the barbershop tomorrow. I'll make you look good. He seems to like that. Son, did you think I had died? Cried? I bet you cried. No, I didn't. Lying. You have puffy eyes. I said no. - Mom. - Yeah? If you are sick, take some medicine. Not a drink. How did you get here? It was too late. Gosh, my driver fee and toll fee... â‚©350,000... What? How much? Whatever! You are always fooled. You don't have to come here every time. Are you sure you are okay? See. I'm totally okay. Your uncle's worried about his big sister, and always takes care of me. How wonderful! You, only focus on your work in Seoul. He needs to stop drinking, seriously. Once a drinker, always a drinker. He might die. Everyone thinks he's over 60. No one knows he is my younger brother. He'll die. He'll die of alcohol poisoning. I don't want him to die. Anyway, it's good to see you here. And how much was the fee? Excuse me. Mr. Park? Morning, Sir. Hey, handsome boy. I can see your heart; warmth. You have to use your super power. No need to save it. Keeping Prof. Gook? He is tricky, isn't he? The days when I hesitated and dithered. And my people. I met thirteen-year-old me. Yeon Joo, almost everything is the same here. Compared to Seoul, time goes by slowly here. Time goes by and leaves its mark. People around here even walk slowly. Ho Yeon, this... This... I fell asleep thinking about you with the light lit. You walk through my locked heart. The day when I heard the sound of the sea waves, I wanted to send you into the sea, but it's not that I can do as I like it. Fall in 1997. Lee Ho Yeon. Thank you, Yeon Joo. Thank you, Ho Yeon. Now I go my own way. What is it? A new car? Mom, just get in. Get in? Mom, and they are... - Cute. Aren't they? - And they are... I think they are crazy. Here! I caught a sea bream that you asked for. Careful. Careful. Take this. Take this. Drink. Drink. Cheers! You know what? What, Mom? It's the first time we have a drink together. No way. It's true. Think about it. I never lie. But a holiday... A holiday! A holiday! You guys didn't care about me. Then it's the first shot that you and I have had. It's an honor, Mr. Lee Ho Yeon. You have a great time with your friends in Seoul, but you didn't know that I like to sip it sometimes. Right? Are you crying again? I told you I'm not. Enjoying your work? Work is not something you enjoy. If you don't enjoy it, just quit. Come here and fry chickens with them. Come on! Mom, I'm quite popular in the office. Popularâ€¦ You have a master's degree. I am interested, but there's no point. Too many people with a master's degree, too many from the U.S... Still, you are the expert in my family. That's because of Father... Are you still taking medicine? No. Well, sometimes. Don't count on that too much. You are so weak. Was he like me? You are the spitting image of your father. It's in your blood. Why did you marry him? Your father? Because he was handsome. Was he? Then, what's going on with me? What's wrong with me? What? - Whatever people say, you are handsome. - Liar. I'm not a liar. You are handsome. You are all the best parts of us. He was a pain in the butt and gave all to others. He was a good man. Get greedy sometimes. It is not that bad, after all. I don't mean for you to take from others. What you want to do or what you like. It is okay to be greedy for that. Mom, do you want to eat my special ramyeon? Ramyeon? I learned it from Jongno, called "disarming" ramyeon. What's in that "disarming" ramyeon? Wait for it. I like chewy noodles. Perfect noodles! It looks delicious. You finished a bottle already before it cooked. - Tell me about it. - Aperitif. Aperitif. - You two can share. - Yes. Give them enough noodles. I'm going to get fat. You need to eat enough food to work. - Thank you. - Share it. Let me see. We regret to inform you that Sin Jung Hee, the former president of Henkel Korea, has passed away. - I'm here. - You're here. Get in there. Ho Yeon. You're here. You don't eat zucchini, do you? Right. It's good. What happened to him? He didn't get up in the morning. He went peacefully. Did you cry? Yes. Perhaps because of the memory. The time I was a newbie. He really adored you. Why did he call you pants-wetter? Well, you know my father died a long time ago. I really liked him when I first met him. I sat next to him at that first dinner with him. I had to pee but didn't want to miss his words or my seat. I felt like if I got up, someone else would take the seat next to him. So I held it. And I wet my pants a little. Really a little. No laughing. It's okay. Hey. I'm considering taking the psychiatry position. And your name was also mentioned. Huh? And I'm telling you that I'm in. Love your fellows, love your country. You are awesome, Kim Hyeon Woo. My fellow. Did you eat? More stew? Oh, Ma'am. - Is he the one? - I'm good. He likes to treat you well. You seem to be eating well. No, it's okay... Eat when you drink. Many people around me, who drink without food, they are all screwed. Some more, please! And Ma'am... This. I borrowed it from him. And I used it well. It's a little late to give it back. I'm sorry, Ma'am. Do you know why I buy you dinner? Because I'm good-looking? Because you eat food with delight. Do you know why I buy you drinks? To do good work. Do well. Doing your best isn't enough. Do well. Don't give what you've earned to others. Do your own job well. Do all the things you want. As you said, I'll eat well and drink well. Like the first shot. A throbbing heart. I'll keep that. And I won't forget to eat food with a drink. Especially an egg. Thanks for everything, Jung Hee. Farewell. Choi Ji Hoon & Seo Ji Hye Please, come. And you should give your blessing to her, who no longer belongs to you. You traitor. Fighting! Thank you for everything, Sir. Sure. Welcome, Lee Ho Yeon! I'll do my best, Ma'am. Let's have a drink. It's still bright outside. Good? - Good! - Good! Then, the place we went to together the other timeâ€¦ Good. Let's go. - Let us go. - Yes. I'm sorry, but you can't meet him today. Please. Would you do me a favor? I'm begging you. I'm sorry, but you can't meet him today. I'm sorry, but you can't meet him today. I'm sorry, but you can't meet him today. I'm sorry, but you can't meet him today. It's my seventh visit. Can I see him just once? Just once? He's too busy. Maybe next time. He really is not here today. He is waiting. Me? - Ho Yeon. - Yes, Ma'am. I told you that you can count on me. - Prof. Gook agreed? - Yes. I arranged another meeting and gave him our products. Good job! Join here. I thought you'd go home after the meeting. I will. After a drink. A drinkâ€¦ Good? Good? Good? Sorry, Ma'am, I have an appointment today. - An appointment? - - Yes. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Seo Yeon - Hello. - Seo Yeon, going home now? Yes. You have an appointment with your fellows tonight. Fellow gatheringâ€¦ You guys are close. No. Who are they? I'm not going there. You always say "love your fellows." Love your fellows. No, we're not that close. Really not close. Never. Really? Can you come to the place of which I'm sending the address now? What place? It's a wonderful oyster bar, especially in this weather. - Oyster? - Right. Hmm. Good! Okay. Someone said, "pretty with a close look, lovely with a long gaze." I was like that. I was slower, hesitated more, and crouched more than anyone did. But now, though I might be swayed and stumble, now I will do what I want to do.
