-Can I help you with something? Oh. - This can't be the whole shipment, Philby tell me this is not the whole shipment. - Oh, where's that packing slip? - It's on the counter. Can we sell of this at a book signing? - If Donald Fiske is doing a signing, I am. - Don't count your chickens before they hatch, he's always canceled two times. - Three. He's kind of... Temperamental. - Unreliable. - Deceitful. - Eccentric. The man has not made a public appearance in over two years. - Which books are shortly ordered? - His second, Murder By Ice Cream. - I read that one, not as good as the first. - It was a best seller, Cassie. So, um, how exactly did you get the elusive Mr. Fiske to agree to a signing. - He couldn't resist my charm, my grace. - Uh, you've never met him, have you? - Apparently my telephone voice is pretty enticing. - More than just your voice. - What. - That guy over there, he's been looking at you more than that book he's been pretending to read. - I, no he hasn't, really? - Yeah. Go ask him what he wants. - Has that worked for you? - No, I'm a DA. The only guys I meet are public defenders and alleged felons. - So what, all your dates end with a plea? - Sam, Sam, I'll see you later. Hi. Um, someone will help you in a minute. - Oh, thank you, I, I was just browsing. Is this your store? - No, I'm just a friend of the owner's. Bye. Go. - Are you looking for something special? - Are you Samantha Kinsey? - Yeah. - Randy told me about you. - Randy? - Randy Lawrence. He says you've known each other since... Bradley. What are you doing here? - Just looking out for my interest. - Your interests have nothing to do with my business. Besides, I thought you thought this whole idea was stupid, remember? - But then I thought you might be right about test- marketing the game. - Stinky. Stinky Lawrence. - Nobody's called me that since... - You're Stinky Lawrence, from Colbert Olsen Elementary, Mrs. Donner's class. I haven't seen you since freshman year of high school. - I knew you'd remember, Sammy. I heard you took over your uncle's bookstore. - Samantha. - Randy. - Who are you? - Bradley Stillman. - Emusing Games. What is that, video games, computer games? - Exactly. - Hours of mind-numbing glee watching some non-human kill and maim everything in its path? - But the sound effects are awesome. - No thanks. - Hey, you see now, that's why I created the world's very first computer game mystery. I call it, Whodunit. It's gonna be available exclusively at Mystery Woman. - I sell books, not games. - Whodunit's very much more than just a game, it's the next step in the evolution of mystery. Your bookstore is a perfect launching pad for it. - Most of my customers don't have computers, and even if they did, why would I want to sell them something that kept them from reading? It's bad for business. - You're tough, Sammy. I like that. Tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put the game on your shelves, entirely on consignment. No cost to you whatsoever. We'll sell it for $24.95 a unit, I'll cut you in for half, that's $12.50 a unit for doing absolutely nothing. - $12.50 a unit? Wow. - Don't decide right now, take it home, play the game. If it's not the greatest mystery that you've ever... Thanks, but no thanks. - Sammy. - Stinky. - It's great seeing you again. - You, too, Randy Lawrence. - Very nice meeting you. You know, we can take this game to the next gamers convention. - Samantha? Fiske just called. He's cancelled again. - That's four. Uh. -This is Donald Fiske. Please leave a message. Oh, hello Mr. Fiske, this is Samantha Kinsey from Mystery Woman, and I was just looking at my calendar and I realized that the last week of the month is, uh, the Western Days Festival, so I was thinking that we could reschedule your book signing, um, to feature your book the Pale Horse Dude Ranch, which I know is your first, and probably very close to your heart. So, um, anyway, just, give me a call, please. Thank you so much, Mr. Fiske. He's never gonna call. - Maybe the sixth message is the charm. - It better be, or I'm gonna be left with over 100 books if I can't sweet talk him into rescheduling. - You know, I couldn't help but overhear... - Randy, not now. - Were you just talking to Donald Fiske? - I believe the lady told you to leave. - Okay. - Wait, wait. I know I'm gonna regret this. You know Donald Fiske? - The writer, right? Yes, Fiskey and me go way back, I used to bump into him in LA all the time. - Fiskey? - Hates when I call him that. Funny guy. Total slob. It's a wonder he gets anything done, start to finish, through all that mess. - So Donald Fiske actually takes your calls? - Well, I haven't seen him in a couple years, but yeah. Yeah. Total first name basis. I'd be happy to put in a good word for you, next time I'm in LA. - He lives here now. - Really? - Yeah, he moved out of LA, trying to get away from crazed fans and all. - Hmm. - So, you could really give him a call, and put in a good word for me? - Sure. What kind of quid do I get for my quo? Everyone who plays it loves it. - I don't know. - Just play the game. You won't regret this. - I already do. - See you Sammy. - Samantha. - Right, right, Samantha. - You know, I ought to take a cue from him and do a little hustling of my own. You know you want me back. - Get out of here. - Oh, come on, come on, - Can I help you? - Um, I'm, I just stopped by, is, should I come back at a better time? - If you want. - Are they okay in there? - It's nothing, my parents are just communicating. - Maybe if you'd stop complaining for five minutes. - Don't try to get your hands on everything, not anymore that's over. - Everything I did, I did for love. - Yeah, a love of money. - You need me, Fiske, and you know it. - Hey why don't you go back to your general jerk boyfriend. - Excuse me. - Who are you? - I'm Samantha Kinsey, I own Mystery Woman, I'm here about the book signing. Maybe this is a bad time? - What would be a good time. - Uh, for the signing? - When and where, Susannah? - Samantha. - That wasn't my question. - Thursday. - Wednesday, 6:00 PM. - But he said... - I'll do the speaking for Mr. Fiske, and he'll be there. Cameron, in the car. - What are you doing here? Hmm? What do you want from me? - I was just, uh, rethinking Armageddon. - Oh, that's funny. - That woman... - Jody. - Jody. She said that you would do the book signing. - Well, she lied. That's what she does, she opens her mouth, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, pay money to anybody who could shut that woman up for good. - That's a pretty scary thing to say. - Well, you know, I don't mean it. See, that's what you do, is you terrorize the ones you love. - Is that from your new book? - No, that's from being married to that woman for too many years. - She said you'd do the signing on Wednesday. - Well, I won't. Mice. Not loyal like dogs, but their good company. - Better company than your wife? - Jody is my ex-wife. She left many years ago, she ran off with a hustler who spent all of her money. Excuse me, my money, 'til I cut her off. - And the boy? - That's Cameron, he's my son. I didn't win any prizes in the parenting department, but she's got him so messed up that he won't even walk through the front door of the house. - Never? - Never. They've only been around for a few weeks. She says she's ready to reconcile with my wallet, I think. Jody used to be my muse. When we first met, we were like butterflies in heat. Hmm, when she left, um, she took my wings. Writer's block. Tell you what, I'd sit around for hours, days, sometimes. I used to fiddle around with this computer game that I was tinkering with. - Well, uh, thank you for your time, Mr. Fiske. Hey, uh, listen, um, I, I have a, deadline, but, uh, my publishers are after me to turn in an outline, but if I finish by Wednesday, then I'll, I'll, uh, I'll do your book signing for you, yes? - Really? Well, in that case, get to work. - Hmm. - Thank you. - Hmm. - Thank you. - Oh, this is the part. Oh. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What am I waiting for? - For the picture to come back. - How about we try voodoo and stick hot skewers in the set? - No, it's no the TV, it's the DVD player, I spilled coffee on it. - So much for old movie night. - Well, we still have lots of popcorn. - I know I'm going to regret this. Let's play Whodunit? The dorky game for computer geeks everywhere. We will play for five minutes, make fun of how lame it is, until the popcorn is gone, or die of boredom. - I'm in. - Let's give it a try. Lame. - So lame. - This doesn't look good. - No, no, no, don't go in there. - Don't let her go in there. - Hey, try the bridge. - See, there's the guy. - Lookout, he's got a gun. - I see it, I see it. - Throw the cat at him. - Throw the cat? Oh, you got a better idea? Throw it. Yeah. - Nice. - I'm opening the doors. - Look at, there he is, there he is. Don't let him get away. - I'm getting him. Ooh. Ooh. - Right in the eye. - Oh, he's getting away. - Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it. - Oh, oh. Here, here, let go. You do it, you do it. There, there, there, there, there. Ooh. - Wow. - No. No, no way. No way, the mayor's daughter did it. - The slingshot was in her cabana, she must have done it. - Or, or, unless, the meter maids trained squirrel planted it there. - I love this game. - And we're only on level three, there are 31 more to go. - All right, let's do level four. - Oh, it's 1:00 in the morning. - Mm-hmm. - I gotta go. - But we just started. - I am hosting Donald Fiske's book signing in 17 hours, give or take. Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. Okay, how do I get fingerprints off a squirrel? - Hey, Sammy. Try my game yet? - Hi, Randy. - Hi. You tried the game? - Uh, yeah, but I really can't talk to you right now. - But you liked it, right? I mean, don't tell me you didn't like it. Everybody likes it. Just tell me you like it. - It's good. It's really good. - See, I told you. So what do you think? You gonna sell it? You've gotta sell it, it sells itself, look, I printed up postcards for the, uh, mailing, don't worry, I'll pay for the postage of course. And does your customer mailing list computerized. - Randy, Randy, I am happy to talk to you about this, but I have Donald Fiske's book signing in 30 minutes. What? - Nothing. He's, he's coming here? - Well, you ought to stay, I'm sure old Fiskey will be happy to see a familiar face. - I gotta go. I, uh, I gotta pick up the posters. I'm going to paper every telephone pole in town. Come to Mystery Woman Books, the exclusive distributor of Whodunit. - Randy, don't do that. I have not agreed. - I'll call you. Come on, Bradley, let's go. - I think I'm going to have to take a break. Or I will be dictating my next book. - It's an honor, Mr. Fiske. - Thank you. - Well, I will get you some food. - Okay. I think I'm gonna get myself something to drink. Hello. - Mr. Fiske, I, um, got you some Shoo- Feng Green Tea. I read in an old interview that it was your favorite, so. Mm. I just wanted a lazy reporter to look up the spelling. - Oh. - Doesn't mean I don't like it. - You know, you're really terrific with your fans. I'm surprised that you didn't want to do the book signing. - What's this? - Oh, it's just a computer game. - Whodunit? - It's actually pretty great. I didn't think I'd like it, but, once you get into it, it's got these great clues, and these wild characters. I mean, it's, it's not as good as a book, of course, but, um, the guy who designed it, he wants me to sell it here, and, actually, he said that he knows you. - The fellow who created this game? - Yeah. Uh, his name is... - Oh. - Excuse me. - Who put this tray on the edge? It could have taken off my toe. - Whoa, hey. Hey. - This is disgusting. - Aren't you glad you didn't serve sloppy Joes? Yes. - Where is my husband? - Um, did you check the aisles? - He's gone. - He left? Shock that marriage didn't last. - Your guest of honor left without signing all the books. - Yeah, I wonder where he went. - Cameron. Have you seen your father? - No. - We're leaving. - Hello? Anybody home? - Nino, I want pictures of everything in this room. - You got it, boss. - Especially that desk. Guys, I want nice, clean prints. - Yes, ma'am. - Just tell me how you killed him. - I keep telling you, I didn't. -Dr. Esperanto, do you have the cause of death yet? - Looks like asphyxia. - So you suffocated him. - No. He was like that when I came in. I didn't even know the guy. - Oh, really? Well, my witness here... she... Miss Kinsey? How about we don't go around contaminating the crime scene, leave this up to the professionals. It's a crime scene. - Sir, can I turn this computer off? - Never. What's on stays on. Just tag it. - Okay. Miss Kinsey, please. - Coming, Chief. She says you told her you did know Fiske. Even bragged about it. - Because I was trying to impress her. I wanted her to sell my game. - He's probably telling the truth. He really did want me to sell his game. - Sorry I'm late, fill me in? - The writer is dead, and I'm getting ready to arrest Randy. - Why? - How about you found him standing over the dead body? - That doesn't prove anything. The door was wide open, anybody could have come in. - Wait a minute. This guy just lied to you about knowing Fiske and now you're gonna vouch for him? - I am just asking for the facts. - The facts. This guy just strangled your friend. - Donald Fiske wasn't exactly my friend. - I said asphyxia, not suffocation. - Asphyxia is lack of oxygen. - Which can be caused by suffocation or, when the respiratory muscles are simply paralyzed. - How simply? - Best guess, poison, so you'll have to wait for the toxicology tests. - I need those, quick as you can. The fingerprints and all the rest of the forensic data, ASAP, please. Poison. Hmm. He's going with us. Let's go. - On your feet, sir. Let's go. - So the last time you saw him alive was at the bookstore. - Yeah, I was at the book signing, I was getting them some tea. So that's when I turned away from him, and I went to pick up the tray that Jody Fiske spilled. - The ex-Mrs. Fiske dropped a tray? - Hors d'oeuvres. - So right in the middle of nothing in particular, she just drops the tray of food. - I guess. - You guess? - That's what I said, Chief. - Sorry, it's taking so long folks, I'll get to all of you. First you. Mrs. Fiske. Thank you. Last door on the right, please. - I already told you, the last time I saw him was at the bookstore. I can't believe you have me waiting here for hours, for this. - Just a few more routine questions, Mrs. Fiske. - I'd look for unauthorized visitors, but, I can't take my eyes off of this. - Now, after you left the bookstore, where did you go? - You want me to give you an alibi? - Yes. - I went to the hotel, with my son. We watched TV. - That's all? Just straight to the hotel? - Yes. If you ask me, that little bookstore tart had something to do with this. - Miss Kinsey? What makes you say that? - She's suspicious. She's short, and she's nosy, and she wears bad shoes. - If Sam were here, she'd have something to say about that. - Am I short, Cassie? - Shh. - When did you leave the bookstore? - Right after my mom and dad. I wandered around town a while, and then went back to the hotel. - Was your mom with you. - No, I didn't see her until breakfast. - What'd you do back at the hotel? - I watched a really good old movie. - I wanted Fiske to give me an endorsement for my computer game. - Why didn't you ask him at the bookstore? - I left the bookstore before he got there. - And the next day you snuck into his house? - I didn't sneak, I went to see him, because he's a famous mystery writer, and his name on my product would help boost sales. - And when he wouldn't' cooperate, you murdered him. - Now how's that gonna help my sales? - And once again, everybody is innocent. Not much new there. - We know Jody's lying, and her son didn't give her an alibi. - He didn't give himself one, either. - I don't know why Chief Conners didn't press that issue. - Cassie. Preliminary report, I was right. Asphyxiation by poisoning. - A nerve agent? - Nerve agents are really common, a lot of pesticides use them. - Fiske drank pesticide? - I wouldn't leap to that conclusion, although by the looks of the body, he died very quickly. No thrashing, no convulsions. - So what does that indicate? - Well, either he ingested a lot of poison, or it was very, very potent. - So the key to finding Fiske's killer is finding the source of the poison. - Which is what Chief Conners will do, once the tox screens come in, and he knows which poison to look for. Here you go, Don. - If we put in a key word like poison, we'd be here all day. - The key here is the victim, start with the victim and work outwards. - We have to correlate all the databases. - Who benefits from Fiske's death? - And then looking for coincidences. - Randy has no obvious connection to Fiske. - Then narrow it down to unexplained coincidences. - Jody and her son could definitely benefit from the inheritance. - And there you have it. Correlation, the shops that sell the poisons, all the people in this area that bought it, and the credit card records of the purchasers. - Correlation. - And a lead. - Philby, how do you have access to these databases? Aren't they supposed to be protected? - They are. - You bought the poison. - Oh, please. - You can either talk to me, or you can talk to the police, but I know they're looking for a good suspect, and I'm happy to give them you. - Let's discuss this in private? I am nobody's suspect. I loved Donald. - Fiske was killed by poison. You bought the poison. - Poison? It wasn't to kill Donald, it was to kill his rodents before I moved in. - You were moving in? - Yes. We were gonna get remarried. - Wow. I, didn't know Fiske very well, but from what he said... - Exactly how well did you get to know Donald? - I met him the day I met you, we talked, he accepted my invitation. - You mean, solicitation. - What are you talking about? - Like I didn't know where he was headed the minute he stayed behind at the bookstore. - He left. - Waiting outside is not leaving. - Uh, okay, wait a minute, are you saying that, Fiske stayed outside my bookstore after he left? - Listen to little Miss Innocent. You think I was never onto his games? - What games? - They were always the same. I've got an emergency meeting here. I've got, uh, crisis there. Be home in five minutes. And then he shows up, hours later, reeking of infidelity. - Fiske told you that he wanted to see me romantically. - He didn't have to. He was waiting outside the bookstore. He asked me to leave without him. Said that he had to talk to some guy. - What guy? - I don't know, Rocky, Roary... - Randy? Randy Lawrence? Fiske was talking to Randy Lawrence. - It was just an excuse to get me to leave. - Maybe. - Miss Kinsey, May I make a suggestion? Keep your nose out of other people's business. - Thank you for the advice. - Sammy, hey. What are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood. - Come in. You weren't supposed to see this yet. It's gonna be a surprise. I built it for your store. See? It accommodates three customers at once. Each one playing a special limited loop of the software. - Why did you lie to Chief Conners about knowing Fiske? - I didn't know him. - You told me you did know him. - Well, that was just to get you to try the game. - Somebody saw you talking to Fiske outside my store. - No, they didn't. - He certainly acted like he knew you. When he saw your promotional materials, he got really aggravated, the kind of aggravated reserved for people who have actually met you. - I never met him. - Never met who? Are we talking about Donald Fiske? - I was. Randy not so much. - Arrest him for murder. - Look, I didn't kill anyone. - The damning evidence came out of your own mouth, son. You claimed you never touched anything at the murder scene. - That's right, I didn't. - Well, your finger prints were found on several items, including the drinking glass that had traces of poison on it. - No, no, no, no, I never touched. - Don't say anything without talking to your lawyer. - As my good friend Miranda would say, you have the right to remain silence, Miss Kinsey. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - You don't think that Randy killed Fiske, do you? - Just because I didn't oppose bail doesn't mean I think he's innocent. - The evidence is circumstantial. - Poison is premeditated. People don't just carry it around unless they're gonna use it. - Okay, so how did Randy get Fiske to drink it, it's not like he had a weapon pointed at his head. - I don't have all the answers. Sometimes circumstantial is all you need to infer the truth. In this case, it looks like Randy did it. - Why? - Because no one else could have. I gotta go. - You know, not a lot of lawyers could have come up with that bail money so quick. Coming in cold like that. - Yeah, yeah, you did a great job. Thanks for finding him for me. And paying for him. - That's what partners are for, right? - I guess. - Oh, I've been in touch with some marketing people. They think they can get us some key product placement on those CSI shows. We'll time it to coincide with the release when my company takes the whole thing national in time for Christmas. - Sammy. What are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood. - Again. Huh. - How are you? - You know what they say, three hots and a cot, what more can a man ask for? - Yeah. - Well, I better go check on that bail money transfer. Nice seeing you again. - So. You played my game. I knew you'd love it. When do you want to start selling at your store? - You're in jail for murder. - Well, it's mistake. I'll be out on bail soon. Why would anyone think I killed Fiske? - Besides the fact that you were standing over the dead body, that you were scene arguing with the deceased, and that you lied about knowing him. Your fingerprints were on the glass that killed him. - Yeah, besides all that. - Randy, why did you lie about touching anything in the room. - I don't know, 'cause, 'cause how often do I walk into a room and find a corpse in it? I panicked. I, I don't know what I did. - That's not your best defense. - I did not kill Donald Fiske. - Well, that leaves the question, who did? - All we have left, is probably flowers. Lots of flowers. Lilies. I'd like, only white lilies, I mean, if you put the amount of money I'm spending, that shouldn't be a problem. - White lilies it is. I'll make all the arrangements and then call you later this afternoon for your final approval. - Thank you. - It's not easy making funeral arrangements for a loved one, is it? - No, it isn't. At least he can rest in peace, now that they've caught his killer. - The evidence against Randy is purely circumstantial. - Well, I'm sure that will be of great comfort as he's rotting in prison. - They're gonna need more to convict him, like the poison. Nobody's found it. - I have a vague memory of telling you to mind your own business. - If in fact it turns out that your poison did kill Fiske, Chief Conners will be looking to you as a co-conspirator. - I never even opened the poison. For all I know, it's still in the gardening shed. - Well then, you have nothing to worry about, do you? - The woman's weapon of choice is generally poison. Agatha Christie killed more than half of her victims with it. - Yeah, fictionally. - I just don't believe that Randy killed Fiske. But, Jody isn't panning out as a suspect, either. - I had an envoy once. - Envoy? - Oh, that's what she preferred being called. - She? - This envoy said, when you hit a dead end, go backwards. - I thought an envoy was a go-between. - The point is, what do we know about our suspects' activities, prior to the crime. - Well, for Jody, nothing. But for Randy, pretty much everything's a big hole after the first year of high school. - Huh. I'll make a few inquiries, see if I can fill in the background. Can you think of anything else? - I'm stuck on the poison. We still don't know what it is. - I'll make some calls. - Cassie? Come on, Cassie. - Hi. Was I expecting you? - Why was your door locked? - I didn't want to be disturbed. - Can I come in? - Sure. I thought you'd never ask. - Why are you acting like weirdo? - Weirdo? I got a heavy caseload, I'm working late. - I came to see Fiske's toxicology report. - Fiske, Donald. Third one in the heap. - Autopsy. Blood test. No toxicology. - I wonder how they isolate poisons. They probably have a hundred different color canaries. - Canaries? - You know, like a canary in a coal mine? If a red one dies, it's cyanide, green, lead. - Yeah, I'm sure that's how they do it. Wow. Suspects fingerprints are a 10-point match. - I'll bring that up in opening arguments. - Suspects fingerprints found on the drinking glass, the desk, and the computer power button? The power button? Thanks. Why don't you get some rest? - You touched the computer. - What computer? - You know exactly what computer I'm talking about, and don't tell me you panicked. Your fingerprints are on the power button. Why? - I don't know, when I came in, it was making noises, like an alarm. I turned it off. - Randy, you're lying. The computer was on when they were dusting for prints, that means you turned it on, not off. Why? - Uh, maybe I thought I turned it off, maybe I just hit the reset button. What are you asking about the stupid computer? I didn't kill Fiske, remember? - Randy, I really want to believe you. I'm probably the only person on the planet who wants to believe you, but the problem is, I know you lie. - Hi. - What took you so long? - Uh, I was just heading out the door. - Meet me at the Fiske house. - Why? - Because it's a crime scene, and I need you to go in with me. - Now? - Yes, now, tonight, it's important. - All right, I'm on my way. - Thank you. Come on, Cassie. Hi, you've reached Cassandra Tilman, - Miss Kinsey. I told you to mind your own business. - Oh. I'm telling you, the computer was there, and now it's gone. Ooh. - Easy honey, easy. - So why would anyone steal a computer unless there was something important on it. - Research, his next novel. Texas Hold 'Em. Oh, what, like I'm the only one. - Jody was there. - You said she didn't hit you. - No, there had to have been someone with her. But who? - Is she gonna live? - Probably just a minor concussion. No memory loss, she's not dizzy. - So a couple of aspirin. - Some rest. - Good. Go do that. - Chief, I got hit in the head. - And you didn't see who did it. I got your statement, Miss Kinsey. And I've got patrols out looking for the ex-wife. You think it's so cute, this amateur sleuthing of yours. Well, there's no such thing. It only happens in books. - And computer games. And, you know, your job, too. - I don't solve mysteries, Miss Kinsey, I solve crimes. I put bad guys in jail, and I try not to risk my life or anybody else's when I'm doing it, including yours. I had your car taken back to the bookstore. Go home, Snoopy. Keep the ice on your head. - Is that her kid? - Yeah, do you believe the story about his mom being missing? - I don't know. Chief Conners was trying to be polite, but chances are, Mrs. Fiske has a boyfriend. - Big guy, likes to bonk people in the head? - I thought you said you only saw her at the house. - Yes, I, but while I was waiting for you outside I saw a shadow. - A guy? A big guy? - I don't know. - You should really get some more rest. - I feel better, though. Thanks, Cassie. - You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. - Putting up posters, huh? - I'm trying to find my mom. - You have a reward. Where are you getting the money? - I got some money. I'd have more if my mother hadn't... - If she hadn't what? - Nothing. - When was the last time you saw her? - We were supposed to meet for dinner last night, I waited, she never showed, so I went back up to my room. - She just didn't show. - Yeah, that happens sometimes. - And so you were in your room all night. Has your mom said anything about your dad's house? - She went there earlier. - Earlier? Like in the daytime? - Yeah, I heard her talking to her realtor. - She's looking to sell already? - She hates that house. - Because of the mice? - I don't know. Maybe because it's of all that cool stone and tile work. It's not really her style. You gonna help find her? - Cameron, I don't know what I can do. - Right. - How's your head? - News travels fast around here. - Well, your car was out there this morning when I opened up, and Cassie just called checking on you. - She told you what happened last night? - You should really leave that type of investigation to professionals. - Like Chief Conners. - I was talking about myself. You should be home in bed. - Philby, we need to add Fiske's son, Cameron, to our list of suspects. - Really? - Really. - Why? - He knew about the stone and tile work in the house. Fiske told me that Cameron had never been inside. At least, not until last night. - You think he's the one that hit you? - Well, I saw Jody Fiske right before I got hit. - Well, it doesn't mean he was out there with her. - He admitted to knowing his mom was going to the house. He knew where she'd be, figured she'd be alone, and now he's going all over town, saying his mom's missing. - So you're thinking that maybe Cameron got rid of his father, and now his mother? - I don't know. To be honest, the kid kind of gives me the creeps. Did you find anything? - It turns out that Jody Fiske and Randy Lawrence are both dead broke. - It would explain why Jody's in such a hurry to sell the house. - Did you know that Randy was in computer graphics? - That makes sense, for him to be able to design a game. - Yeah, but he didn't start designing games until two years ago, before that, he did graphics for hire. Websites, that kind of thing. - Oh, we're missing something. - You're still not convinced that Randy's your man? - He's a liar, a hustler... But he doesn't need to kill anyone, he just wears them out. - And that's not one of our current causes of death. - No, it's not. Randy makes me very angry, but there's a certain honesty about his dishonesty. Jody Fiske and her son are impossible to read. I know they're up to something, I just don't know what it is. Hello? Hey Cassie. Okay, we'll be right there. The police found Jody Fiske. Let's go. - But you never saw their faces. - Most of the time I was wrapped up in that disgusting blanket. I couldn't' see if it was night or day, let alone what anyone looked like. - Scott, tag and bag all that stuff for evidence. - You got it, chief. - We're on it. - You don't know how many there were because you were wrapped up in a blanket. - That is correct. Plus the fact that they tied a blindfold around my eyes, and they stuck this just filthy rag in my mouth. - Did they tell you what they wanted? - No. - Do you have any idea why you would be kidnapped, and then released? - No. - Okay. The only thing we're sure of is my officer found her in the park wrapped up in a blanket, bumbling around. She claims she was kidnapped, but person, or persons of unknown origin, motive for the kidnapping, unknown. - Kidnapped with no apparent motive? - Number of assailants, unknown. - Big guys. - The same guys that hit me? - I didn't see anything. I mean, it all happened so fast, and, it was dark. - Did they ever speak to you? - Not in English. - What language were they speaking? I don't know, Spanish, I guess. - Do you speak Spanish? - No. Gora. Gora this, Gora that, Gora. - Gora. - Gora. That's Spanish for hat. - They were talking about a hat? - That makes no sense. - Of course not. None of it makes any sense. - How dare you accuse me of lying. I didn't make up the fact that I was kidnapped, it happened, it was real. - You know what's real, the bump on my head. - Ladies, ladies. Shouldn't you be home getting some rest. - Samantha. - All right. Mrs. Fiske. - You're not scoring any points for diplomacy. - That woman is so obnoxious it's just hard to stay collected. - This is important. You're never gonna get anything out of her by being on the offensive. - What do you mean? - She knows more than she thinks she knows. - Or she's just making it up as she goes along. - Like that part about the Spanish guy? - Right, and the hats? - Unless he's not talking about hats. He may not even be speaking Spanish. - Go on. Eh gora , it's Russian, for game. - As in computer game, as in Randy? - Fiske's computer went missing the same time she did. - I'm sure she has it. She's probably lied about everything. - Do you remember The Maltese Falcon? - Yeah, Dashiell Hammett. Sam Spade finds the woman who killed his partner. - He finds her, he falls in love with her. He gets her to confess, then he turns her over to the cops. - Makes you wonder about love. - He kept his eye on his goal. - Solving his partner's murder. - Keep your eye on your goal, put your personal feelings aside. - Thank you, Philby. - Okay. I'm gonna have one of my officers give Miss Fiske a ride back to her hotel. - That won't be necessary chief, I'll give her a ride back. Here, you ought to call your son. I know he's worried about you. - You talked to him? - It's you he wants to hear from. Just think of it as a peace offering. I've been a little cranky ever since I got hit on the head. Call Cameron. He needs to hear from you. - A shower felt so good. I just want to scrub the whole experience off me. I felt like a hostage. - Well, they say that the easiest way to get over a trauma like this is to really purge it. - Meaning? - Well, you said that you were in the trunk of a car, that it was bumpy, what did you hear? - What did I hear? I remember hearing jets. Jet engines. - Take a ride with me. Come on. There's no airport within 100 miles, so the jets you heard have to be something else. We'll just see if this sounds familiar, okay? Here we are. Is that what you heard? - My jet engines are an industrial laundry? - They made Arnie move his business out of town. Too noisy. - This is where they threw me down. What is it? - My guess? It's the missing computer. - Philby. - What is that? - That's the hard drive. - I thought a hard drive would be bigger than that. - Oh, it's been badly beaten up. It's like somebody laid into it with a hammer. - So all the information that was once on it is now gone? - Not necessarily. - What's this? - This is my secret weapon. - Will it explode? - It's not that kind of weapon. It's more like a tool for invading other computers. - Philby, are you a hacker? - Computer forensics is not hacking, it's like, uh, doing a, autopsy on an invisible patient. - So do you think there's a chance you can recover anything? - Well, I have to make a forensic image, a mirror copy. Any work that's done has to be done off that. - Jody Fiske seemed pretty unnerved. - Do you think she set all this up? - You mean, do I think she's dumb enough to lead me to the computer, by accident, or, smart enough to lead me to the computer, knowing that we won't find anything, or desperate enough to do anything she possibly could to distract me from finding Fiske's killer? - Oh, I got, it's all that banking information. - Off Fiske Inc? Is that his corporation? - Look at the signature. See who it's made out to. - The Lawrence Group. As in Randy Lawrence? This is from two years ago. Why did Donald Fiske pay Randy Lawrence $3000? - I doubt if it was charity. - I know who to ask. Do you need anything? - Just time. Forensics is not pointing and clicking. Samantha, what exactly is the question? - Why did Donald Fiske pay you $3000 two years ago, and don't lie to me. - I did some graphics work for him. - You told me you didn't know him. - I didn't. I mean, I knew him, but I didn't know him, okay, not like a friend. - But you did computer graphics for Fiske. - I used to do a lot of that stuff. Website design, I could do one for your store. - Oh, no, let's stick to the subject here. - There's nothing else to tell. Fiske threw a check at me for half of what he owed, and kicked me out of his house. - I'm gonna find out you're still lying to me, aren't I? - Miss Kinsey, Miss Kinsey, can I have a word with you? - What about? - Our friend Randy. - He's not exactly my friend. - Did he tell you that he's backing out of our partnership? - No. - Look, I have no intention of changing his game. - So tell him that. - I've tried, but you know Randy, he's not exactly the most trusting person. But for some reason, he trusts you. - And you want me to talk to him as a favor to you? - As a favor to him. Now, Randy kids living off of credit cards. - Yeah, he mentioned he was over extended. - Did he happen to mention that the credit cards he's using belong to other people? - They're stolen? Are you sure? - Look, I don't want to get him into any trouble, and the police don't know about this yet. I'm offering him a big advance, lots of cash. So he can get back on his feet, start over again. He'll listen to you. - At this point, I think Randy is beyond my help. - Well. I gave it a shot. - Yes, you did. - Thank you. - Thank you. You know, Cameron, you've been so wonderful through all of this. - I am a man, not a child. - Of course you're not a little kid, what's wrong? - Why do you always do those things? - Keep your voice down. What are you talking about? - You know exactly what I'm talking about, mother. - Cameron, wait up. Cameron? Cameron? I Donald Fiske, last will and testament. Hello? Hey, Cassie, what's wrong? Okay, I'll be right there. Cassie? Cassie? Cassie? Cassie? - I'm back here. - Hey, what's wrong? - Everything. - Well, that's a lot. - Me. I'm wrong. I'm a terrible person. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. I should have been there for you, and I wasn't, and you got hurt, and something else could have happened. - Cassie. I got hit on the head, that is not your fault. - Yes, it is my fault, I should have been there, I should have protected my friend. - What are you talking about? - This. - Randy's game? - It's all I do. I don't call my friends, I don't do my work, I didn't go to your book signing, and I haven't washed my hair in two days. - It's a look. - Take it. Please. Destroy it, it's addictive. I had to get out of my house, so I could get away from my laptop. - You poor thing. - I feel like such an idiot. - You are. You are. Philby, what you're doing there is amazing, it's like magic. - It's more like stubbornness. - Well, that suits you. - There's not that many places to look, unallocated spaces, slack areas. One tiny fragment, that leads you to another, and pretty soon, you put the whole thing together. - Like a mystery. - Somewhat. - That's why you like it? - That's why it's so frustrating. - Like this murder. I've got all these fragments, poison, kidnapping, and a hand written will, but none of it fits together. - Ah-ha. - Ah-ha what? - Whodunit? - Philby, what are you talking about? - The videogame was on Fiske's computer. - Really? - It's a pretty big file. You really can't miss it. - You said was? - Well, it was erased recently. - So it's gone? - Well, erased is not gone. - So can you recover the part that says when it was erased? - It should be in a tiny dat file. Here. May 26, 10:23 AM. - That's the day after the book signing. And I think that's about the time I saw Randy at Fiske's computer. He touched the computer and erased the game, but why? - I'm sure Randy has a perfectly distorted answer. - Before I ask him, I think I need some more information. Can you launch the game from this file? - Probably. - Not the same. - It's not the same game? - It's not the same version. It's the same set up, but the sound isn't as good, and the graphics are rudimentary. On Randy's version, the girl doesn't look like... - Olive Oil. - Philby, can you find out how long the game's been on Fiske's computer? - It was created on Fiske's computer. - Fiske created the game? Well that explains why the mysteries are so good. - Fiske wrote the original version. - But I think as an exercise for himself, when he had writers block. Fiske told me that he fiddled with the game. And Randy must have seen it when he did graphics work for Fiske, and he stole it. - Randy was a very bad boy. - Bad enough that when Fiske found out, Randy killed him? - Gonna talk to Randy? - That's not my job. - Hmm. - The court has deemed you a flight risk, don't be surprised if your bail is revoked. Get him out of here. - I hope I did the right thing. I just don't want to believe he did it. - You did what you had to do. - Morning. - Hi. You getting ready to leave town? - No, in fact, I'm staying. Until I prove Randy is innocent. - There's a lot of evidence against him. - According to you. - According to Chief Conners, he's the one who made the arrest. - Because you called him. - I just turned over what we found on Fiske's hard drive. - Which proves nothing. - It proves that Fiske created the game, not Randy. - That's your so called evidence? A difference of opinion over who created the game? - It's not an opinion, it's a fact. - Because you two saw it on a hard drive. - Not just any hard drive, Fiske's hard drive. - It's a reason to hire a good lawyer, not a reason to kill somebody. - And you're not just saying this because you want the game. - Randy trusted you. He thought you were his friend. - You're only interested in cutting deals. You don't even care about the fact that somebody died. - I'm not the one ghoulishly making profits off a dead man's books. - That's not fair. - Which part? Exploiting the guy that got gassed, or railroading Randy? You know, you may not believe this, but in the months that I was pursuing Randy, I've come to respect and admire him. He's creative and passionate. But apparently to you, he's just a nuisance. - Well, you did the right thing by turning in the evidence. You had a potentially dangerous killer off the streets. - Unless he didn't kill him. - He probably did. - I have doubts. - Well, get over them. - No, seriously. Where did the poison come from? How did Randy get Fiske to drink it, who hit me, who kidnapped the ex-Mrs. Fiske? Yeah? Really? Really? Well, thanks Melinda. - What? - You're never gonna guess. - The ex-wife was kidnapped again? - Ooh, nice twist, but no. Toxicology just came in, the poison that killed Fiske was more lethal than the pesticide. It's called VX. - What's that? - It's a chemical weapon. - Weapon as in military? - Yeah. - So what does that mean? - It means that I'm gonna be fielding calls from the Department Of Defense, Army, Homeland Security... - So no more running? - No, I'll be knee deep in reports. - Well, there's gotta be some exercise in that. - See ya. - Philby, where would the average person get their hands on a chemical weapon? - Have you tried Ebay? - It turns out the poison that killed Fiske is something called VX. - That's odorless and colorless, it's 10 times more lethal than sarin. - You've worked with it? - Oh, VX is Russian. The KGB created it. At the FSB, secret lab, right outside Moscow. - Not so secret. Russian poison, Russian kidnapper, are we thinking that Fiske died as a result of some weird Russian spy thing? - Probably not. The Russians stockpiled most of their chemicals in a little town, right in the middle of Russian Mob territory. - Some of it's getting out. - The Russian Army can't afford to pay it's guards as well as the Russian Mob can afford to pay them off. - So the Russian mob has VX. - Possibly. Possibly. - Yes, Medical Examiner's Office, may I help you? Oh, I'm sorry, she's not in at the moment, may I take a message? - Come in. - Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. - Oh, how's your head? - So much better, thank you. All these are beautiful. - Well, it's a lot of work, really, but, without them it's like a morgue in here. - Oh, I get it. You're a medical examiner. - It's okay, none of my patients laughed either. - Hello. Oh, Miss Kinsey. - Chief. - Doctor, am I too early for our appointment? - We were just going out to lunch. - Oh, well, don't let me keep you. - I'll be gone about an hour, if you need me, page me. - I heard Donald Fiske was poisoned by VX? - No mystery there, Miss Kinsey. - Yes, it was VX. - Well, how was he poisoned? VX is pretty powerful, it wasn't just sitting around waiting for him to drink it. - Respiratory evidence is that he inhaled it. - Probably administered as an aerosol. - Have you found an aerosol sprayer anywhere? - No, we didn't. But we're still looking. Doctor, shall we? - Have a nice lunch. - Thank you. - You probably didn't expect to see me, did you? - I was just working on an idea I had for a new video game. It's called Prison Escape. Lots of digging tunnels with spoons and saw blades in cakes. - Why did you go to the Fiske house? - I went there to make him an offer, 50/50 if he'd just let me go ahead and sell Whodunit? - Why would you cut him in? - He designed a computer game. He hired me to do the graphics for it, on his computer. I told you, he didn't pay me everything that he owed me. - Was the game called Whodunit? - Yeah. But I figured he owed me something, so, I, uh, I broke into his house, and stole a copy off his computer. - You're finally telling me the truth. - That was two years ago. I thought I was home free. He never intended to go commercial with the game, so, what's the big deal? - It wasn't yours. The game was stolen goods. - Yeah, but I improved it, a lot. Better music, better graphics. - So you started feeling guilty, and you offered him half of his own game, but he wasn't gonna go for it. - Well, I never got around to doing that, 'cause he was already dead when I got there. - And you panicked? - Yes. - But not so much that you didn't stop and exploit the moment. - I figured if the game was erased off his computer, that no one would ever know. But I didn't kill him. I, I didn't even talk to him. - Except for outside at my bookstore. - Why does everyone keep saying that? - Because people saw you. - That wasn't me. You saw me leave. I never went back. The next time I saw Fiske, he was dead. - Miss Kinsey? Miss Kinsey, I just wanted to say that I heard you were responsible for the arrest of Donald's killer. - The police arrested Randy Lawrence. - The computer game guy? - You know about the game? - I overheard my dad talking to you about him at the signing. - You said you saw Fiske talking to Randy outside my bookstore? - Yes. - Did you tell the police that? - Yes, I have now. - Where exactly where they? - Over there, in the corner. - And they were just standing there? - Well, Donald was by the gates, and that Randy fellow, he was, behind him, in the shadows. - Are you sure it was Randy? - I'm sure that my husband's killer is in jail. - Well, I guess you guys can move on with your lives. - Whatever that means. I mean, there is movie rights, there's memorial collections. It's a big job. - I'm sure that'll all get sorted out when the estate is settled. - I am the executor. - Hmm. Well, good luck. - Thank you. Cameron? - Hey. Ooh. - Philby, it's me. I need your help. I've seen this man before. - But you don't know who he is? - No, but I just remember him from somewhere. - And you had to get close to get a better look? - I used my flash to light him up. - When exactly do we stop printing photos and report the shooting? - As soon as I find what I'm looking for. It's amazing how a near death experience can jog your memory. - People who escape death often recount a feeling of irrational exuberance. - He's got to be the same guy who hit me, the same guy who kidnapped Jody, the same guy who stole Fiske's computer. And the first time I saw him was right here. - Fiske's book signing. - Yeah. He's our Russian connection. - Are you sure about that? - No, that's why I need you. - Hard to find out who he is and who he knows. - He's our connection, but not our killer. - He came to steal Fiske's hard drive. - But only after the evidence against Randy had been turned in, so what doe that tell us? - There must be something else on that hard drive. - I am so glad you made a copy. - See if I can come up with something. - Yeah, but in the morning. - It's morning now. - Really? - Yeah. Don't forget, we gotta report that shooting. - Did you report the shooting to Chief Conners? - No. - You're nuts. Obviously someone's trying to do you harm. - What do you know about the Russian mob? - Only that the more you know, the scarier it gets. Do you think the Russian mob is after you? - You worked for the US Attorney's Organized Crime Division. - I clerked there after law school. - I think Fiske has a Russian connection. - You mean the poison, the VX? - Did you know it was Russian mob? - I'm not surprised. - So what else are they into? - Besides drugs, prostitution, people smuggling and murder for hire? - I was hoping for something that connects Fiske? - Well, there is a potential connection, but you're not gonna like it. - What is it? - Bootlegging. - Bootlegging. As in pirated DVDs and software. - Yeah, and computer games. - There's that magic word again. - Lucrative word. Pirated games sell in the hundreds of millions. Tempting for people like your friend in jail. - Cassie, none of it adds up. - Yeah. I'm on my way. You may want to come along for this. - For what? - Chief Conners just found the aerosol sprayer can used to poison Fiske. Hello? - I got a name to go with that face. - You got an ID already? That's great. - Ilya Kalugin. Europol connection to a number of Russian mobsters. He freelances, former KGB. - Russian mob? - You know how they like poisons. Remember when they sprayed that gas into the theater with all the hostages? - That's right. Thank you, Philby. - What was that about? - Later. I've told you, I've never seen it before. I don't even know what it is. - Counselor. - Chief. - It's a compressed air atomizer, with industrial strength o-rings. So the poison stays off you, but it hits your target. - It's not mine. Don't you understand? - Well then how did it get in your room? - Stop asking me that. - Then answer my question. - How did you find out the sprayer was in her room? - Anonymous call. - Was it recorded? - No, the switchboard took a message, said it was a male voice. - Whoever planted it, that's who called, that's your killer. I didn't kill anybody. - Maybe not, but there is other evidence, evidence you thought you destroyed. - If you have other evidence, Miss Kinsey, now'd be a good time to spill it. - The night she got kidnapped, the night I got hit in the head, what was she doing at the Fiske house? - You got hit, get over it. - Maybe I did get over it, because I remembered something. The first day I went to the Fiske house, you two were arguing. - We're always arguing. - No, this was about something specific. Get out of here, all right? - Maybe if you'd stop complaining for five minutes. - Don't try to get your hands on everything, not anymore, that's over. - Everything I did, I did for love. - Yeah, a love of money. - He was talking about his new will. - There is no new will. - There is. Donald Fiske wrote it in his own handwriting, and he signed it, and that night you went to the house, you destroyed it. But I found the legal pad, just like a carbon copy, it's still legally binding. Cameron gets everything, and it names a new executor. - That is a fantasy. - Well, we have photographs of the crime scene, everything that's on that table. Won't be that difficult to check it out. - I did not kill Donald. - That remains to be seen. Hook her up. You have the right to remain silent. - Please, save it. - Things keep getting weirder and weirder. - There's just something too convenient. - I thought she was your prime suspect. - This was so convenient. - You, too, Goth boy, let's take a ride. - This is ridiculous. - We'll see how ridiculous it is. - All right, I'll go wrap things up with Chief Conners, I'll see you at the car? - Hi. - Hi, can I help you? - Uh, Bradley Stillman's room, please? - Mr. Stillman just checked out, but if you hurry, you might catch him out front. - Thank you. I thought you were staying? - Business, but I'll be back. - Well, give my regards to Ilya. - Who? - Ilya Kalugin? At first I thought the Russian mob was involved, but then I realized that you just hired a goon. - Don't know what you're talking about. - Bradley, I am talking about the man you hired to get rid of Fiske, the man who kidnapped Jody, and then delivered her to Chief Conner's arms, very conveniently, making her a suspect. - And what possible purpose would that serve? - Conniving ex-wife of the victim, you knew that nobody would want to believe her story. And it took the blame away from you. It was you she saw talking to Fiske outside of my bookstore. - That's a good story, it would make a fun game. - But you really weren't interested in the 50/50 share with Fiske. You got greedy. And once you had Randy all signed on the dotted line, you knew he was taking care of, and you were left with a multi-million dollar video game. - You have an overactive imagination. - You said he was gassed. - What? - When you came to my bookstore, pretending to care about poor, innocent Randy, remember? - Which part? Exploiting the guy that got gassed, or railroading Randy. - You said he was gassed. - Everyone knows he was poisoned, that's no secret. - Everybody thought he drank the poison. Only the killer knew he was gassed. - You read too many mysteries. - Well, apparently I haven't been paying close enough attention, because I made the mistake of letting you get to me, just like you planned. You knew that we had Donald Fiske's hard drive, but you were the only one who knew that. So you came in, and you stole it. Or you had Ilya do it. You wanted to eliminate any trace of the game. - You know what? Call me when you got your fairytale figured out. - You want a happy ending? Ilya only took the original hard drive. We have the copy. - You're bluffing. - Then I'm also bluffing about finding a gas mask in your nice designer bag. You planted the sprayer in Jody's room, but nobody in their right mind would spray VX without a mask. - So you think that I have the gas mask in my suitcase? Take a look. -Ah - Hey. Miss Kinsey. - There's you're killer, Chief, I'll explain everything later. - Loni, get him out of here. - You got it, Chief. - Uh. - I thought I told you to let me handle this. It's nice footwork, though. - Were you gonna tell me about this? - Later. - Well, at least tell me how you learned that move. - If I told you how I did it, I'd have to kill you. - Where did you learn that? - Just talent. - Sammy. Samantha. Uh, I'm heading out, I just wanted to say thank you. For believing in me. - All you had to do was tell the truth. - I'm working on the whole credit card issue. - And the game? - I'm gonna manage it for the Fiske estate. - Nice work, Stinky. - What are you doing here? - I thought you might be here. - My mother said he liked you. - Not in the way she probably meant. - Yeah, maybe not. - You left that legal pad for me to find. - Maybe. - You got your mom in some trouble. - Well, she shouldn't' have taken the will. She was always, I don't know, pushing him away from me. Keeping us apart. - I'm sure she was just doing what she thought she had to. Cameron, I think she really loves you. - Yeah, in her own, twisted way. - He said that he regretted he wasn't a better father to you. - He told you that? - You ought to have this. - My dad's game. - Have you ever played it? - No. - It's amazing. There's this, uh, meter maid, and she's a complete psychopath, but, she has an alibi, and a trained squirrel, so, she basically gets through everything, totally unscathed...
