Aladdin and the Magic Lamp There was once a celebrated mage who practised sorcery. Rich with treasure, he still remembered poverty. Master of Darkness, Who made me the most powerful mage on earth, You who've enabled me to turn an owl into a dog. A dog into a cat, a cat into a rat... To send wind to the desert. Dark Master, help me to find a magical object. A magic lamp contains all the powers obeyed by the spirits of earth. Earth, wind and fire. Master, reveal to me where the magic lamp is hidden. Listen here, I know where it's hidden. You're interrupting my meditation. You better listen to me or you'll regret it! Clear off before I cage you! Master who I call. I await you. Master, I see you. I await your command. I want to know where the magic lamp is hidden. Let me concentrate... I see the lamp in the far-off Orient. There is a small village on the Chinese border between three hills. A powerful Sultan rules over the people. There you will find what you seek. But I warn you... Only an innocent hand can retrieve it from the earth. Where do I find this village? It's for you to find. But I warn you again not to touch it first on pain of death. However, if you obey, you will be the most powerful in the world. I will obey. I will find this village. And the lamp will be mine! I'll be the master of the universe! We'll both be masters of the universe! The universe! We'll both be masters of the universe! Open sesame! Let's go! Walk! Let's go! Will you move? Forgot to wind you up. And now... off we go! Rascals! Who threw the ball? It was me, uncle. It was an accident. Uncle? I'm no uncle. I could use this opportunity to get to know them. No problem, my boy. You look familiar. Tell me who your father is. What's your name. -My name is Aladdin. My father was Mustafa, a tailor. I live alone with my mother. My father passed away long ago. Aladdin... Of course! He is just what I need. What good luck. Darling nephew! My brother's son! What a shame. Such sad news. You caught my attention as I was going to see him. I just wanted to leave him a letter. What happened to him? I don't remember. I was too young. Not surprising. Been a long time since I left. Have a gold coin. Surprise your mother. Tonight, I'm dining with you. Thank you, uncle! I'm so happy! With my shiny gold coin I'll buy slippers for my feet. Made of silk from Borneo and lots of treats to eat. A turkey stuffed with chestnuts and a dozen rainbow trout. Ice cream topped with chocolate sauce and tons of sauerkraut. Mama will gobble lots of pork and lobster Thermidor. A big plate of Baked Alaska, and Russian caviar. With my shiny piece of gold, I will buy a thousand things. Mom would like a diamond ring, and a monkey on a string. I'll treat the beggars to a feast with lots of wine to drink. I don't think they would end up fighting with my cousin. With my shiny gold coin, I will get fine food to eat. All the foods I love to eat. Put them all into my mouth. Mama, look what I got! A gold coin! Look at that! Where did you get a gold coin? Who gave you a coin? -My uncle! He gave it. -Your uncle? You don't have any living uncles! Yes, an uncle. Father's brother! He recognised me. He's invited me to dinner tonight. Now he has an uncle! An uncle! An uncle! It all seems strange. Your father has an uncle? But I thought he'd passed away. A coin! A coin! Take a look! My uncle is rich! Very rich! Aladdin, open the door. Your uncle is here. My dear sister. A pleasure! A joy to reunite with my family! After a life of loneliness you give me a reason to go on. To live or not to live, that is the question. I have a vast fortune and Aladdin will inherit it all! How can we ever repay you? Tell me uncle, can we stay with you forever? Yes, stay with you! We'll have plenty of gold, gold, gold, gold! You stay on the ground! You'll anger him! Don't be angry. Why didn't you tell me the news? Sister, I didn't know where you were. I have been travelling all over the world. I spent long years in Africa. In the marvellous land of Egypt... For long I had travelled India. Land of the Maharaj and of fabulous riches. I made my fortune in China. I visited the celestial kingdom. From Peking and Tongking. In boats and in junks. I travelled with rich Mandarins. Then to the fabulous land of Persia. Where the ground is paved with gold. The flowers are rubies and the pebbles are emeralds. I amassed a large fortune. In the hope of one day sharing it with my brother. But, alas I returned too late. But I am glad to have found his son! I have tried to find him all this time. He's my dearest. Well, I agree. That's also my view. I will take him with me for a tour of the world. Oh yes, uncle! When do we leave? The great day has arrived! The sun is shining brilliantly as usual. That morning at his front door, Aladdin awaits the hour impatiently for his uncle to arrive. Just like that you look far more presentable. You look as handsome as a prince. Really? Thanks uncle. For all that you have done for me. Now I'll show you the most extraordinary palace in the world. A palace? A real palace? I've never been to one! Take a good look! It's magnificent! Will they let us in? Of course, but you must obey everything that I say. Don't touch anything without my permission. I swear! The garden of a thousand marvels! These exotic plants grow nowhere else on earth! Here all the animals have wings. Oh uncle, it's extraordinary! Marvellous! Pretty flower. Don't touch anything! Who touches the flower will drop dead! But they don't look dangerous. They are so pretty. Let's go. We've lost our way. There's nothing but bats! - Be brave, boy. It's so dark! Don't be scared! We've reached the end of our journey. Keep completely still. In the water, on the earth, in the fire. Master, appear! Mage of Egypt, don't forget what I told you... You've found the secret hiding place of the magic lamp. It will give you power over everything. Remember: You must not touch the lamp nor enter the cave. Only this boy is able to bring back the lamp. If you disobey, the world will swallow you up. Uncle, let's go now! Leave? No, we need to find the secret passage. Aladdin, see that slab? If you open that you can enter a realm of marvels. It's too heavy for me. I can't lift it. -Take this ring. This time, repeat your father's name three times. Mustafa, Mustafa, Mustafa. Aladdin... Remember the magic ring can open any door. That's true. I forgot! Mustafa, Mustafa, Mustafa. Careful, Aladdin. If you yield to the sin of greed, evil will befall you. That'll teach you to obey me. Mustafa, Mustafa, Mustafa. This is the Enchanted Garden. All the trees are covered in diamonds, ...rubies and emeralds. Beautiful! Aladdin, we are so glad you have visited. Come on. Come closer to us. These diamonds are for you. All yours! Here are rubies. Take them. Stop, foolish boy! It's a trap! It will turn you into a tree for the rest of your life. What must I do? Where must I go? Count three trees to your left. Advance two steps. Now three leagues to your right. There you will find an immense stairway. There is a platform at the top of the stairs. There you will see an altar on which a lamp is shining. There is the lamp for which you've searched. Monsters! I'm awake. I must be brave. Don't be scared. -They're blocking my way. Shine the ring's rays! -I'm too scared! I order it! -Yes. Yes, uncle. Take the lamp! The lamp! It looks amazing! Hurry! Return to me! Don't be afraid. The lamp will protect you. The diamonds have been turned into fruit. Eat! Nothing will happen. You are the Master of the Lamp. Master of the Lamp? Really? I'm protected? This fruit is delicious! It's you! I've brought you the lamp. It's marvellous! Give it to me! Give me the lamp! Once I have the lamp, I'll leave him in the cavern forever. Get me out of here! Then I'll give you the lamp, I promise! First the lamp or I'll leave you here. Little lamp, save me... I'll be grateful. Mama! Oh please Allah, help me to get out! The ring! I know it can help me! It can open any door! Mustafa, Mustafa, Mustafa... You called? Master Aladdin. What do you wish? I don't know who you are. But if you must obey, please send me back to my mother. Aladdin! -Mama! It's ok, you've arrived. Where is your uncle? Don't mention him! He locked me up in a dark cave. My poor boy. I might never have seen you again. Yes, but I don't regret anything. I saw many magnificent things! There was a garden of trees, covered in diamonds. And rubies and emeralds. Rooms full of gold coins! Gold coins? We could use some now! Yes, we have nothing to eat! Alas, all that I brought is this old lamp. Perhaps if I polished it we could sell it. We could get a few coins for it. I am the genie of the lamp. Your wish is my command. Ask anything and it will be done. I didn't call you and you've scared my mother! Yet she called me when she rubbed the lamp. What is your wish? We're hungry. Bring us food. Mother, wake up! Look at what the genie has brought. The genie? What? Oh yes... Where is he? I was so scared. What has he done? Help yourself! I'm hungry too. It's to share. This one's for you! But who has provided all this? The genie! The one who gave you a fright. He is the servant of the lamp. He said: your wish is my command. Don't mess around with the genie. It was all finished. Later on, the feast had all been eaten. All that the genie had miraculously provided. Forgetting the powers of the lamp... they began to worry about the future. Aladdin, stop worrying so much! I'll sell this yarn at the market. My poor mother! You work so hard. You ruin your health for just a few coins! I have an idea! Plates for sale. Anyone for plates? Get your plates! Hey squirt! Let me see what you're selling! Cream of the crop! I'll sell them cheap. I'll give you good price! Very well, I'll give you one gold piece. A large sum for someone like me. Thank you! My mother will be pleased! Gold plates! Best deal of my life! With my shiny gold coin, what can I buy, sir? Silken suit from Borneo. For a prince or just for you. How much, Mr. merchant? For a pair of slippers. First you must give me money. Pay before you take a shower. I'll take a bag of cinnamon, some peppers and some rice. See how rich I am? Be sure to treat me well. I'd like a dozen donuts and I'm prepared to pay. Take some honey cakes that I baked today. Music maestro, please play your melodies. Play your flute and tambourine. It sounds great when you play together! With my shiny gold coins... Many months and years passed since the rich magician abandoned Aladdin in the cave. Meanwhile, the magician had tried to get the lamp back. But he assumed it was still in the cave. I blame that rascal. That thug! The lamp might be lost forever. Instead of moaning, why don't you ask the crystal ball? You don't even know what happened to Aladdin. I am certain that Aladdin has disappeared forever! Magician, but how do you know? Shut up! You evil bird! Aladdin has been dead for a long time... May he roast in Hades. May the ghosts gobble him up. Now let me get back to my magical ruse. My various mixtures, my powders and tinctures. My lotions and potions. My extracts and beeswax, my fires and ju-jus. Aladdin's alive as he can be. Hiding inside your distillery. He's bewitching all of your recipes. He's there as snug as a bug in a rug. He's right there in your arsenic jar. You perfidious foul! -Don't touch or I'll howl! I'll stuff you with sawdust, you silly old owl! Aladdin's alive, he's still on the prowl. Aladdin is dead, now let me get back to my sorcery! I'd watch my step if I were you. You're liable to end as a sorcerer too. Pluck my feathers and leave me to freeze, Freezy is easy when weather is breezy, Now you will see I'm right. In the water, earth and the fire... I am calling you! Master of Darkness... Tell me what happened to Aladdin and the magic lamp. God, he's ugly! Let me concentrate... Aladdin is now a handsome young man. Thanks to the lamp, he has become rich and respected. He's alive! And he has the lamp! Evil bird! I'm not defeated yet. I'll find that lamp and get him! I'm off to the Orient! By order of the Grand Vizier, Take today to win tomorrow, your doors and windows must remain closed. On pain of death do not look at the street. For Her Highness, the princess, the Sultan's daughter, will take a bath. Mother, I saw the princess and can't stop thinking about her. That's a crime against her majesty! Punishable by death! Forget her! As fast as you can! Oh yes. Forget all about the princess. Nothing is impossible when you sleep. To see you is worth all the world's money. Though his home be a palace and his power supreme. He's a pauper without love. You live in a tall tower. Or a cottage small, I will come to call. I will come on tip-toes and in simple clothes. Come and tip-toe in simple clothes. To offer but a rose. Living life upon the path. In a grand palace, love will take your heart. Come and tip-toe in simple clothes. To offer but a rose.... Come and tip-toe in simple clothes. To offer but a rose.... Oh mother, I saw the princess. I will never forget her! I can't live without her! This is madness! The Sultan would never give you the hand of his only daughter! He's crazy! The Princess will be my wife! Tomorrow you must ask the Sultan for her hand. I'll try... But don't delude yourself! What do you want, woman? This is the Sultan's tribunal. It's invitation only! I have not come for a lawsuit. I need to speak to the Sultan on a personal matter. By what right do you dare interrupt these proceedings? Grand Vizier, let me hear this woman. Thank you for hearing me. Well, what is it? Before I ask I wish to beg mercy for my boldness. You are forgiven. You have my pardon. I am the widow of Mustafa the tailor. I have an only son who is in love with the princess. I have come to ask for her to marry him. Silence! It is custom to offer a gift to the father, when asking his daughter's hand. Or did you forget? I would not dare to forget that! Here is my gift. Stand back! Be careful! What if it's full of poisonous snakes? I have asked this woman for the marriage gift. Come forward. Have no fear. Look... Here it is... What magnificent stones! Nothing is too beautiful for the princess! Daughter of the venerable Sultan! I have never seen such perfection in my life! Look Vizier, perhaps you disagree? Whoever can afford such a gift is worthy of the Princess. I will do all I can to prevent it. I was promised she would marry my son! Your present pleases me, good woman. And I will look with favour on your son's request. But I request his presence within three days from now. He will do everything you command. That's not all! I want him to bring me a wedding present. I want 40 coffers of gold! Brought to me by 40 white elephants! Each elephant accompanied by a richly dressed slave. He must build a magnificent palace next door for the bride. It must be worthy of my daughter! Oh, what an amazing palace! It's even better than mine! To have built such a palace in just one night! Aladdin must be a remarkable young man! Father! Father! What a splendid palace! Your fiance built it for you as a sign of his affection! My fiance? But I have no fiance! Father, I beg you to keep me with you! Don't make me marry him for gems and gold! You do as I say! A princess must obey her father! Father, I don't want to get married! Silence! Stop blubbering and get dressed in your finest clothes and jewels! Illustrous king, I bring you gifts from my master. The magnificent and powerful Aladdin! Those forty elephants are splendid! 40 barrels of gold. An amazing gift! Yes, father. Truly beautiful! Illustrious king. I have kept my promise. Now I ask for the hand of your daughter. I grant your wish. The gifts you brought were worthy. The wedding will take place tomorrow. Weren't you the one I sang with? It was me. I hope you come to love me. By the command of our illustrious and powerful ruler, you are notified of the impending marriage of the Princess Badroulboudour and Aladdin, son of the tailor, Mustafa. Aladdin with the princess? The public is invited to partake in the festivities! Celebrations will last three days. I've finally found you! Much may happen between now and tomorrow. I have not eaten in three days... Please come in, you poor man. The poor are always welcome here... Thank you. Thanks very much. You seem so tired. Have you travelled far? I've seen that face somewhere! Yes, I come from far away. In my own country I was a very rich merchant. But my foes took all I own and left me in rags. Since then I wander, begging from town to town. I've already found what I came looking for. What have you found? -It's him! It's him! What's with that stupid bird! Look out! It's the evil uncle! He's a thief! Squawk all you like. I have the lamp! The marvellous lamp! What a happy day this will be. For today, he'll marry me. Pray to heavens our marriage is blessed with every joy today. May the promise of happiness, sing on my wedding day... Princess, there's a man outside who wants to see you. He can't wait; he says its urgent. Who are you to request my presence? I am the great magician of Africa! One of the great sages of the world! Everything in this palace belongs to me! Lies! This was given to me by my fiance! Aladdin. Leave now! Or my servants will throw you out! You don't believe me? So much the worse for you! Your wish, is my command. Servant of the Lamp, move this palace and its inhabitants to Egypt. Your desires are my orders. Stop that noise! Instead, tell me how the Princess feels today. Does she think of me? Mutual feelings? The Princess! The Princess doesn't love you! She will love me! Not even she can resist the lamp's power! Oh, no! It won't work! Don't do it! I am the Servant of the Lamp. What do you wish? You order, I obey. Bring me the most sumptuous jewels and robes. Make me the most handsome man in the world. As you ordered, Master. Is that all? That will be all for now. It was a new day and everything had changed. Aladdin was accused of abducting the Princess. He was led under heavy guard to be judged by the Sultan. You're charged with sorcery. With black magic he caused a palace to disappear. Using his demonic powers he spirited away the Princess. Beloved daughter of our Sultan. Where is the Princess? Speak! If you don't return her at once, you will be condemned to death! Noble Sultan, I do not know where the Princess is. But I swear by Allah I will find her. Don't believe him! Aladdin has deceived you once already! He is a cunning sorceror! Vizier, I know how much you hate Aladdin. But the fate of my daughter is in his hands! I ask only for five days' grace. If I fail to find her I will return to be judged. Granted! But if you fail to keep your vow, I will find you wherever you hide. Thank you, Sire! You will not regret this. I swear on my honour! I'll find the Princess... Sing rub a dub in a tub full of bubbles. Pretend you're a submarine deep in the foam. Bring the brush with the bristles to polish my dome. And for scrubbing my toes, to curl my moustache. You've taken a bath, that's nice to see. Lift your arms. -Don't dare tickle me! You can't overdo it when you're a pursuer. You'll sure look like a wower and wooer. It's true, its a fact. -I'll take a towel. Without a game I'll take the prize. You're devil-may-care when you're 90 years old. Bring my girdle, my vest and my best. My cloak and my dagger, my turbin, my sash. I must admit, you're quite the hit. If I were the princess I'd fall in your arms. If she has any taste, she will succomb. I am as handsome as any prince charming. Not bad at all! How handsome you are! Oh Princess, I have searched for you in vain for four days. Darling, I prefer death than never seeing you again. I know a place where nobody will find me. I will go there and disappear from this world forever. I just have to lift this slab. Then I can bury myself in the bowels of the earth. Wherever you are I pray that my words may now reach you. I love you with all my heart and soul. Eh? The magic ring! Mustafa, Mustafa, Mustafa! I am the servant of the ring. And to all those who wear the ring. What is your wish? -Servant of the ring... To return my palace and all that is in it. What you ask is impossible. What you ask concerns another genie. Then take me to the genie and my love. I will gladly do that. Hello, my princess. Did you sleep well? Alas no. I dreamed many dreams. My beloved came to find me. It was no dream. I am here, my love! No! Ask him to show you the magic lamp. What did you say, my dear? If you truly love me, show me the magic lamp. Here it is! It's marvellous! Would you let me try it? -Enough! Be my wife or I will summon the genie! Help me, Aladdin! -You can cry all day! Look out, magician! Rascal! Oh, beloved. Quickly! Give me the lamp! Will you call the genie? I'm scared... Don't be afraid. He's a friend. You called the servant of the lamp? Your wish is my command. Genie of the lamp, I wish to be rid of the Egyptian magician. You have ordered, I shall obey. Perhaps we could imprison him in a shell. And then shoot him up into the clouds. Fly him to the moon in a mysterious machine. Up there he can't bother us again. Maybe not. He might come back some day. Ah, I know! Your wish is my command. Lock him with his evil own in that crystal ball forever. Farewell Magician! Now my love, will you accept me as your husband? Yes, my beloved. I love you. More than ever. Have you any other wishes to ask? Return this palace and its inhabitants to the land of the Great Sultan. The father of my love, the princess. Nothing. Still no news. And today is the last of the five days I granted Aladdin. I warned you, master, not to trust the word of that magician. What's this mirage? It is Aladdin's palace! Yes, it surely is! Where is the Princess? Father! Daughter! My daughter! My child! How happy I am to see you again! Oh father, Aladdin has saved my life! Aladdin, come here. I think I should punish you for your offences. Whatever you desire, gracious Sire, I will accept. If Aladdin deserves punishment, I wish to share it with him! Perfect! I sentence Aladdin to be married tomorrow morning. And so the tale of Aladdin ends with festivities and merriment. Subtitles by shaunx (cg)
