Come on in, sit down. You can just sit on the floor. It's fine. You look better down there anyway. You wanna experience me again? Just tell me what you're into. Alexandra Snow, she's a very well managed brand. She's a professional person and she's very good at her craft. The moment she came onto our site, we're very honored. She's a very big name. Mm, you love this. I always admire women that have a good hustle and do really well very quickly, and she had that, like, right outta the gate. What's wrong? You don't wanna disclose all your deepest, darkest fantasies? Take it down. There we go. You're doing dirty, filthy, kinky, wonderful things, and it gives us the spice that we need. It's weird, you sit online and you, like, humiliate guys, that... wanna lick your dirty feet. We payout a model just shy of $35,000 for a month. I can't guarantee that I'll take good care of you, but I will be exceedingly thorough. It's making, you know, a lot of girls successful and happy, and it's making a lot of guys realize that they need to bow down. I'm gonna break you into the smallest little pieces and reassemble you as something else entirely. Yeah. Goes something like that. All right, please say again. All right. Uh, custom JOI CEI clip. "Please make me follow your instructions as I jerk off to you with some humiliation about what I'm doing for you. Uh, depending on how cruel you're feeling, it's up to you whether or not I have to ruin my orgasm. Um, either way, please make me eat my cum for you while you give me a bit of humiliation. Please make me thank you afterwards, thank you. Um, and if possible, please also blow a kiss at the end." So thank you and the blowing a kiss at the end - is what you have to remember. - Okay. I'm super in love with this lens. I have this, like, little ritual that I do that I get set up, I look in the camera, I'm like, "Okay, we're good." I go and I turn the camera on. I go back, I throw my hands to my hair, I look down and then it goes. I... I have no prep, there's no nothing. I've gotten it down to a science. You look so cute over there with your cock so hard. She draws a lot of it from herself and her own experiences, but, like, she articulates it in such a way that makes it fantastic and draws you into the fantasy. I did want to pursue, uh, an acting career at some point, and I decided to pursue psychology and IT instead. I'm really glad that I did because now I do get to act and make way more money than most actors will ever get to make. You like it? So obviously a female domination is the role of a female in the dominant position, right? There will be no cumming at all... until I say otherwise. Femdom is at its heart. The empowerment of... Of a woman to be able to have her pleasure and power, have the way that she wants to have it first and foremost. Uh, slow. I would have said it's gonna hurt more. It's a bit of a misnomer because it's like, the... the idea is that somehow femdom is... is very selfish. And... and the reality is... is that it's not, it's just that that's the other side of masculine culture that said male pleasure comes first. Stroke for latex Goddess. Your rubber Queen. I'm Alexandra Snow. I'm a professional dominatrix, media producer, um, visionary entrepreneur and I believe that all of this is just a grand adventure. Good boy! Down, down, down. Fucking bug. There's Dominus Snow and there's Goddess Snow. Dominus Snow is the real life dominatrix. She is the real deal. Does sessions, interacting with slaves, like hands on dominant woman persona. And then there is Goddess Snow who is more of a, like, almost a religious deity. You want us to look into your future and by looking into your future I became it. Guys don't have to actually physically feel their... Her hands on them, like when they're... When she's peering magically into their mind and making them jerk off or whatever. I'm selling through several different pay-per-view platforms. Things like Clips4sale, Kink Bomb, iWantClips. And, uh, each one takes on average, like, between 40 and 60% commission. I have six unique videos per week therefore I'm less concerned about how much one video sells, I'm more concerned about how all of them sell. You're ready to choke it down? Are you ready to slobber that whole face full of juice? I bet it's right there, isn't it? - Uh-huh? - Uh! Should we give 'em a countdown? I think we should. There are so many different reasons why someone might be into kinks and fetishes and power exchange. Uh, and it's all, for the most part, healthy. -Aw, there we go. It can also be very cathartic. Um, a lot of people work through trauma and work through difficult experiences that they have. It can also be a way to deal with stress and anxiety. And again, it's just fucking sexy. -Two. Thank you God... One of the biggest stumbling blocks for folks is that they have this fear that if they see a mistress that, "Oh, this is... I'm... I'm seeing a prostitute. I'm... I'm... I'm seeing a sex worker. And what if people find out and... and this is just bad. This is dirty." And, you know, which goes back to this really old belief system that women's sexuality is dirty and that women's sexuality is threatening and dangerous in some way. Which, you know, was a really wonderful way to keep women at bay and... and keep them in their place by not allowing them to assert their sexuality and their sexual power. We could be more careful. ♪ I was third generation animal person, right? My grandmother bred horses and then dogs and my mom bred dogs. And... and so I was like raised in a kennel, literally. Like, that's what... That's what I did for fun. Like we... we went to dog shows on the weekends. So first grade, my grandmother gets called to the school. I'd gotten in trouble, I was in the principal's office and my grandmother comes in and she goes, "What seems to be the issue?" And the principal gets up in huff and she says "Well, she was out there calling little girls bitches." And my grandmother looks at me... and she's like, "What?" I was like, "We were playing dog show and I had them all on all fours as dogs running around me in a circle 'cause I'm the judge." And my grandmother is like, "Do you have a dictionary?" And, you know, the principal's like, all, huff and huff, gets the dictionary. "Like, I'd like to show you that bitch is the correct term for female dog. This is a school and we're we supposed to be educating our children." My grandmother pulled no punches, right? And then my grandmother turns to me and goes, "Well, who was gonna win?" And I was like, "I hadn't got the judging yet." Remember... ♪ When I first identified as being a dominant female, I thought there was something wrong with me, right? Like I... I genuinely thought there was something wrong with me. I'm having this like, um, like therapy session which I'm like pouring my heart out to this guy. I thought maybe I was having an... an identity with my gender, like, I was identifying with all these very masculine, you know, characteristics, but yet, um, still thought I might have sexual attraction to both. And I had this... This doctor laugh at me and it was just like, just thought it was so funny. He was like, "There's nothing wrong with you. You're not broken. You're not having a gender crisis. You're just rare. You know, dominant women tend to be fairly rare and you don't have a model for it in society." There was this, like, a strange dichotomy of femdom in which that you're supposed to feel powerful wearing hyper feminine clothing, but exhibiting hypermasculine attributes. I was like, "Okay, well I suppose if that's the name of the game, I already have a lot of these characteristics and fuck it. I like... I like the clothes." As a femdom we're definitely giving more scope to gender. You know, you can play with these different roles and experience the loss of control that that role provides. There we go. That looks better. The femdom creates a space where there's no judgment. They create a space where there's no shame. So the person has the opportunity to explore and create and go, "Huh! This is what I'm missing in my day to day, and this is what I want here." And it's a turn on, right? Because imagine being able to be in a space where you can truly be yourself, where the person across from you isn't judging you, there's no shame or blame. That's the sexiest place you can be. I actually got into the adult industry through dancing, through erotic dancing. I took all of the money that I made from being a stripper and used to bankroll my whole business. I sat down probably for three or four months and created a business plan and then completely broke apart everyone's business models and said, "You know what? None of you are doing it the way that I would wanna do it," and I wrote a new one. I'm a big fan of medieval bondage and medieval torture devices, and I wanted to take some of these really cool old medieval plans and modernize them. This is my whipping post. I could really pull someone up and even off the ground. I was talking to a friend about the nature of opening a dungeon and she said, "Wow, it's kind of like you're creating this Garden of Eden thing." And I said, "Ugh. Yeah, A Wicked Eden." And she was like, "That's brilliant!" And I was like, "Yes, it absolutely is brilliant." That's... that's it. That's the name. The training process at Wicked Eden was intense. We had to know how to use every toy in that dungeon ten different ways. We had to know sanitation procedures. We had to know, uh, medical procedures. Everything that I teach the girls, I break into modules. I have an entire training program. There is an actual curriculum with lots of tests. They have to actually be able to go through beginner, intermediate, advanced bondage. BDSM is bondage and discipline, sadomasochism. Those two people, they come to the table as sexual equals, they come to the table with mutual consent. Then they have the opportunity to explore a role that they may or may not live in their day to day life, and that gives them a sense of not only sexual satisfaction, but also release. I forget sometimes that for someone walking in the door for the first time, this may be the most terrifying thing that they've ever... They've ever done, and, you know, that I need to honor that bravery a little bit. I don't think there are actually any vanilla people. I think that there are people who have not been introduced to the right kind of kink for them yet. Count. Thank you. I started my business in Columbus because that's where my now ex-husband was. So my original business partner is... Is Joseph, who is also my ex-husband. Joseph was very adamant with me that I couldn't be out. He had children, they were my stepchildren, and that it would be a threat to... to them, it could be a threat to, you know, the... their custody battle and it was a threat to how we were perceived, you know, in the regular world. He was very obsessed with how others would perceive us. I wanted to be outspoken. I wanted to be proud of what I did, and I didn't want to feel ashamed and have to hide it. And then after I... I had separated from... From my ex-husband, um, I thought, "Okay, well here's my chance." Alex is determined to come out and I think the reasons are right. I think her heart is in the right place and I feel like it'll be a good move. But it doesn't mean I'm not worried about her. What if this is just another tool that people use to exploit her or to put her in danger? I think the public at large has a lot of misconceptions about not just kink and BDSM, but sex workers. And the more we can talk candidly about what we do and have real conversations about those things, the better it's gonna be for everyone. Come on, stand up. -Come on, pussy. Oh, see this little bitch, huh? So how I got started was I was 17 years old just filling out social media profiles and, uh, I would get random guys messaging me. And one guy in particular started to message me and he had a fetish for getting peed on. That was his thing. And then, so eventually he was like, "You know, I really think that your piss should be bottled and sold." And so I was like, "Okay, then buy it," you know? And two weeks later he sent me $250. I started doing webcam and videos and here I am today as a cyber dominatrix. Now look at that camera and say, "Thank you." -Thank you Princess. I met Ceara Lynch, uh, through a chance meeting. We, um, went bowling together. She's telling me about how she sells her dirty underwear to perverts online and I was like, "What? This sounds amazing. How can I get in on this?" I was kind of a starving college student at the time and to be able to make money off something you wear every single day, that just was like, you know, the American dream. We all just started filming these very naive fetish clips at the time. It was really funny. You know, we'd wear our sunglasses and be popping our bubble gum and be like, you know, talking about loser and stuff like that. I filmed every single day when I began, and I posted videos every single day. And I've seen so many girls get into this industry and they couldn't cut it. They didn't make the money because they weren't hardworking. My name is Raevyn Rose and I've always kind of been into porn and, you know, watched... Watched all sorts of kinky porn and stuff. I grew up 50 minutes south of Seattle. It was a small town. It's like a white redneck country down, I don't know, it was pretty trashy, AKA meth central, you know? That's what they called it. Wow! I don't know. It was okay. I'm glad I... I'm glad I don't have to work there. I'm glad I don't have to work in essentially where I grew up because I don't wanna have to see anybody that I ever knew ever again. I was only the odd one out, I guess, because I was religious. I was raised Jehovah's Witness and that, you know, I didn't get to do a lot. I never went to any school dances. I didn't get to do any sports. I didn't really get to express myself a whole lot. I just wasn't allowed. I... I got caught sneaking out once and they basically put me on like kid probation, this thing called 'youths at risk'. And I just, like, followed the rules and did what I had to do, and I was only on it for like two months and then I got off of it and I kind of just did the same thing again. I was just smarter about it. I've been involved in the kink scene for, I'd say two years. I was, um, just going to play parties and I didn't think I'd have any, you know, I guess professional involvement or, you know, turn it into something I'd make money from. When I first met Astro it was at a play party and she was... She was in all leather and she had a slave with her and, you know, she was just telling him to do stuff. She used him as a footrest and she was just, like, really powerful. And this was, you know, my first time seeing her and I was like, "I should go talk to her. I should see how she does this." I saw that she's, like, this really keen, young, energetic, warm-hearted, um, woman. She's a little, I'd say like, not lost, but adventurous and wants to learn a lot about the industry. Astro asked me to do a video, just a... a simple fetish video, which was fun. My first time in front of a camera it was a foot video and yeah, that was... That was pretty much my start. Hey. How's it going? I got into bikini coffee about a year and a half ago. One of my vanilla friends had been doing it a while and she said it's the best money she's ever made. Um, let's see. I have hot coffee, iced coffee, energy drinks, we have Monster and Red Bull and I can make anything blended. Uh, tea, smoothies. I've had customers tip me $50 to $150, um For just looking nice. And then I had one come through because he follows my Snapchat. He's like, "Well, I watch your... Your Snapchat all the time and it's really good and I feel like I should be giving you more money for it." I see him maybe once a month and he'll tip me, like, about a hundred bucks. This area's pretty good. It's pretty innocent. They don't... I rarely get shows or asked for shows here. In my couple years of doing this, I haven't had any really, really scary, uh, instances. But about two weeks ago I did and I... I just... I was working, doing my thing. I had this guy come through and gave me a $10 tip, which is nice, and then, um, you know, I was done and... and then he's like, "Here's a $20 for a show." I was like, "I don't do shows." He's like, "Yes you do. All the other girls do." I'm like, "I'm sorry, I don't. Not my style." And he's like, "You have to do a show." And I'm like, "I'm not doing a show." And I walk away and I'm like, "You have to leave now." I'm just cleaning up and doing my thing and then I walk back over to talk to him and his dick's out. And I was just like, "That's disgusting. You have to leave, you have five seconds to leave or I'm gonna throw hot water on you." And he's like... and then he's just going off on me and calling me names and just flipping out. So I'm, like, pouring this hot water and I was like, "I'm gonna count down now." And I'm... I'm counting down slowly and he's just calling me a cunt and a bitch, just going off. So I get closer and closer and he starts moving. He's like, "If you throw water on me I will fucking shoot you." I'm like, "Okay." So I didn't think anything of it until he came back, like, within two minutes and... and parked his car and starts banging on my windows and my door. And, uh, I had a customer in front of his car and I was like, "Can you wait here while I call the cops 'cause I don't know if he has a weapon, and whether or not he does, he's banging on my windows." So I called the cops, filed a report. He came back one more time, kept doing the thing and... and like kicking rocks at the building. And like, I mean, after arguing that much, like even before he got out of his car, like, why would I wanna flash somebody that's fucking yelling at me? This hot, sexy coffee is nine dollars. It was fun dressing up all the time at first, but now that I have to, like, some days I don't feel like being naked. Like, some days I don't feel like being stared at and with the job I'm entering now I get to choose when I get to do that, I get to choose when I'm getting the attention or when I wanna address the attention. You know, I've only... I've only been camming for a few months, maybe... maybe five-ish times. It's been fun. I talk and... And I even had locals on there. They'll watch me and then they'll come visit me at work. The next thing they're like, "Wow! Your cam show is awesome." So that always feels good. I have 11 people on here right now and six of 'em are guests, so that means they don't have accounts. Tipping is always an option and private rooms are, you know, paid for by second or minute. Being that I'm working a day job already, that kind of takes away from, um, camming and making my own videos because I'm on call. My schedule is all over the place, but everything... All of my work, all of my income is, um, sex work related. So I can... I can advertise myself in many ways through, you know, each of these work outlets, I guess. So that was a tip. Yeah, it was 100 tokens, uh, "Just found you. Would love to be added as a friend. Hello from East Coast USA. Kiss, kiss." When I started doing this it was just me and my webcam, me and my camera. I would get guys who had fetish requests. You're my little cum eater. You're my little bitch. Suck it! The fee and be bossy to me and... and be mean to me and I thought, "Oh, this is kind of funny." I wanted to be a bitch. Like, that's how I'm in real life, you know? Do you want me to take control of that little mind of yours? Mm-hmm. Do you need me to make all of your decisions? I knew that I was making money 'cause I was... I was sexualized, but I didn't feel like I was doing anything sexual. So in the beginning I didn't... I didn't care. I just wanted the money. Honestly. I love the internet in a lot of ways when it comes to folks that have sexual preferences and proclivities that are outside of average, because for so long they haven't necessarily been able to connect with other people that have preferences like theirs. ♪ Well, I've been a pervert since I was five years old. It's been, yeah, pretty much a lifelong thing. Uh, the femdom, um, thing... Part of, I think, I didn't come into it until about I was 13 or 14 and then I discovered my first dirty magazine, femdom magazine. In the early days it was... It was a little more difficult because obviously back then we only had like 14.4-bit modems. There was no HD 4K video. You know, this is, like, all on usenet groups and bulletin boards and ASCII text porn. Ten point bonus. You had to pay for the, like, the membership sites to get like videos because it was really expensive back then, of course. And when the internet speeds caught up, uh, then of course people were able to make their own videos and sell them online and you could see it instantly. ♪ I'm not gonna fuck you right now. I want things to be a little spicier. Like I said, I've been planning. Hey. All right. So I was an exotic dancer and someone came up to me in a club and was kind of a... A mild mannered guy with glasses. And he is like, "So how do you feel about like being mean to guys, like yelling at them? You know, like being a bitch?" I was like, "Why is this so hard to explain? Like, yes. Yes, I'm into that." He'd pay us, like, a lot at the time just for a whole day of like, "All right, get in your brattiest outfit, um, and imagine you're a sorority princess." We found out where he was putting the videos and we were like, "Is he just jerking off to this? It seems bigger than that." So we found it and we found clips for sale and we were like, "Shit, we can do this ourselves!" I think, yeah, clips and indulging in your fetishes instead of like looking for instance, uh, through a whole DVD of regular porn just to see a foot. You're able to find exactly what you need. Our world is busy. You've got ten minutes on the subway real quick, I guess. But like, um, don't jerk off on the subway though, please. There is like a driving change in the porn community and fetish porn allows people to access some desires that they might not be able to access in real life, to fantasize about stuff that they thought was too evil or sick or weird to fantasize about. And I feel like there's a lot of self-acceptance that comes with, like, accepting one's fetish. There's always been perverts, there's always been, you know, these kind of groups and the internet obviously helps people find each other. A lot of people will associate this with like sort of dark... Undercurrent, dark web sort of thing. And it's not, it's just regular people who for obvious reasons don't want to go public with their deepest fantasies. We have a lot of cam girls coming into the industry. We have a lot of porn stars, um, coming into the site now that are shooting content for themselves rather than for a production company, um, where they never get royalties, where they never make money after that one shoot. They think it up from start to finish, they shoot it, they angle it, they make it how they want, and you're getting a connection with the artist and, you know, I think that really goes far with the consumer. I remember the first thing I watched was, like, the very stereotypical like, uh, someone fucked my, like, stepsister and like, she's like extremely, like, dolled up and like... Like, very effeminate voice, "Eh," type of thing. And from there it got really dull, I guess, like, very quickly for me. At first I didn't, like, understand that there was this like whole underground sort of... like, I would even say, like, punk scene of, uh, porn where like it's self-produced, self-published, uh, self-promoted. And I guess that's what... That's what keeps me coming. Uh, no pun intended. I do a lot of research in how our clips are selling. Um, I do... like, I run the analytics on what categories, uh, what clip titles. Um, video lengths, like, the difference between doing a full length video and then doing part one and part two. And, like, we... like, there's a full, like, analytics system that happens that determines what our schedule is going to look like for the next month. So we're gonna do some stuff around, like, kind of just be worshipping my... my legs and we're kissing and doing kind of stuff like that. And then we're gonna do, um, the face sitting part. When we do the face sitting, I'm gonna have her flip around so her head is here. - Okay. - And for... I want to get some very specific shots of like here with... Of like looking up my ass. You're gonna wanna try to get an angle from underneath. If you're doing it, like, right where you are standing... Okay, like go down. Go down further. See... see that's much better? Do not stay in the same place. - Okay. - Okay. Um, ready? And... Oh, this looks nice. -They are very cute. That's so cute. Oh, I know. It's like a reinforced toe here. Fetishes are defined as any sort of, um, sexual attraction to a non-human object or a body part specific, so not the totality of a human being. We don't really know what causes fetishes. You know, we have all sorts of anecdotal stories as to why. We know that when you look at, um, FMRI studies and you look at the brain that the turn on that they get from... And the dopamine burst that they get from seeing their fetish object is the same as the dopamine burst that someone gets when seeing their romantic partner that they're attracted to. I'm a lifelong foot guy. And women's feet in particularly, obviously, that men's feet are kind of gross to me. But, uh, I think they're just amazing and... And pretty and they're really underrated part of the body. They're very sensual and there's been a lot of just, like, scientific research, you know, in it where the feet and the genitals and the brain are very close to each other. There's like possible connections there. There's different experiences you have that inform your fetishes and things like that. And I have often thought about those things and actually thought about a lot of the things that have happened in my life that I definitely probably gave someone a kink or gave someone a fetish. You know what? I'm not, sorry. Not... not sorry. This online world of fetishes has exploded. I think probably before the last decade somebody with a fetish really wanted to be closeted. It was taboo, it was weird. Now, um, it's just all over. It's so popular. It's kind of amazing. You start getting these communities of people online that are into all kinds of crazy things. You know, clown fetish and fart fetish and wedgie fetish and balloon popping. Um, certainly without the internet I don't think that would be the case. Perfect. So I'd like for you to tell me a little bit about where you think you wanna take the Raevyn Rose brand or like what... how you would describe, you know, the... that persona? Yeah, I really am curious and open to trying all these new things. It's... it's truly a new life for me. All right. So cu... curious is a good keyword. - So we're-we're gonna... - I met Alexandra through a mutual friend's birthday party. The way I was coming into the industry, I was taking it very slow. I was only, you know, doing camming and considering doing videos. Which fetishes really speak to you right now that you could... You could kind of see yourself marketing like more than... Than other things? - Humiliation would be one... - Okay. Just 'cause it's... It's very exciting. Or public stuff, I really like public stuff, - figuring it out. - That's a really good one. You know, Astro had told me, "This-this chic's really rad and you're really gonna like her." And... and I was like, "Okay. Okay." So I messaged her and I was like, "Hey, you wanna do some weird stuff in Vegas?" And she's like, "Uh... yeah, let's get weird." I am queen of Khanum... I've come from a planet, that's very far from you. But unfortunately I have been unable to find a suitable host for the perpetuation of my race. I did set up the filming that day, um, for her to be essentially submissive in the first half, and then I brought in a film slave and had her be dominant to him in the second half. I watched her go from one to the other pretty seamlessly and work with me in both roles and was like, you know, excited to learn sounds and excited to learn bondages. And she was like, "Cool, we're gonna dump this guy's cum in his mouth? All right, let's go for it." That's so, so rare to find someone to... To really be like that. No matter what kind of video you're doing, even if you're doing a foot fetish video, an ass worship video, like a masturbation on anything, put your face in as much of the shot as you can because that's actually what's selling your videos. I have turned away probably the last 200 people that have come to me and asked me to train them. I definitely had some individuals for whom they were not as morally and ethically sound. I feel like at this point I've become a much better judge of character and I no longer, "I'm interested in teaching someone who's only motivated by money." Okay, so, when you're setting up, you're gonna set your lights up... There's a big difference between selling a persona and selling yourself. People will always try to pay you for more than you want to do. The best way to combat it is to not... To not be offended, to not be aggressive about it and to... like, to the line just, like, we were doing before where you're like, "Nope, that's not something I offer," right? But there may come times where someone badgers you enough or offers you a lot of money and you're on the fence about it. I want you, and I really, really want you, that if you begin to feel even the slightest bit oily, uncomfortable, you know, like... like feeling like... I'm getting goosebumps thinking about this 'cause it's such a... such a powerful thing. If you feel in any way that you are going to start to compromise any part of your morals or ethics to get paid, don't fucking do it. Don't... don't do it, because it's never worth it. Because afterwards you feel like you gave a piece of your soul that you didn't need to sell. ♪ There's a certain quality that you need as a sex worker to kind of believe that what you're doing is inherently good. We live in a society that people still tell you that being a sex worker is... Is like dirty or gross or it's immoral, or... Or that, you know, "You should be ashamed of it." And it's hard to get that dialogue outta your head, right? But if you inherently believe that the thing that you're doing is positive, it does good for other people, it does good for you, like being able to express it and participate in it and all those things actually has some real intrinsic value, then it's just very, very nourishing. I've been taking these big steps and it's all, you know, towards a career, which is a great feeling for me. With the training I'm going to go through with Alex, eventually producing my own content is going to be my... my job and I'm not gonna have a day job. It's just, like, very surreal to me that I've been making these moves all within the past six months. ♪ We're shooting in Mistress Tia's mansion her place here in Vancouver. What I think we should do is it's gonna be... Like, you have to work late on something when it's kind of a thinly veiled threesome with your boss and your hot coworker. You need 25 videos to launch your store. - Mm-hmm. - Okay? 25 videos shot. If you can't release a video every single day, then you're gonna lose all the traffic in the beginning and you're gonna get a bunch of traffic in the beginning. And all these websites feature you as a new store, and if you are uncomfortable with whatever you're saying or you're like, "Oh, this sounds stupid," I don't care how stupid it is, just keep on going. Many times I'm like, "This is... this is moronic," and the guys are like, "I love this too much." So don't worry about it. I would try to do a nice product mix of solo, like, switchy stuff, as well as dom stuff. So if they only see one type of... of a particular fetish, then they may not come back. I mean, I could terminate you for cause right now. Or do you think you feel like you really need this job? You know, a pervert like this, what do they value? All of this time in the office has been so devoted to his colleagues, his female colleagues. I'm definitely nervous having a little bit of a crowd. And it also being my first time having a whole lot of improv dialogue, I'm a little... I'm a little warm. Yeah. My... my grandmother used to say that I was such a ham that when... When the refrigerator light came on I did a number. And I was like "That's not true." Oh, my God, this porn is so fucking hot! You know what? I don't see your pants growing yet, why? There's nothing going on here. You want a better look? You're gonna start making a lot of money. The money feels really good. But once you get to the point that you're being able to cover all of your own expenses, try to keep your cost of living at 50% or less of what you're making. Because no matter how much money you make, this is... you... you cannot do this forever, right? Aw, you're so... You're so weak and sensitive. Good enough. Good enough, I guess. You know, I think I'm gonna get myself some toys and, uh, and please myself a little more. You can clean up. Good job. - Okay. - Cut it. So next time you do more small penis stimulation stuff, talk more about the size of the dick - and how the dick doesn't... - Yeah. Um, especially 'cause you do solo masturbation stuff... Not many people combine small penis stimulation with like, nudity and masturbation. So maybe you're gonna be like, "This is the kind of cock that pleases me. Your cock doesn't please me. Well, I guess you can watch what it would look like. Ha, ha.", you know, and then... And go from there, it's really... it's a good angle. - Okay, cool. - I'd definitely do that. - Good job. - Yeah. Thanks. She comes from a generation that has... Has the least amount of stigma attached to sex work that's ever happened, right? She's not having to unpack the baggage. My mom first thought I was a stripper and I was like, "Mom, I can't dance. Like, there's no fucking way I'm a stripper." And then... and then she thought I was escorting and I was just like, "Maybe if I'm completely honest with her, she'll feel like I'm safe." Feet... ass. Mm-mm, what really fucks you up the most? She thinks if I'm nude, it's the worst thing ever. So I try to explain to her like, "Guys are still jerking off, but I'm clothed and I'm at home and I'm safe and I'm happy." And I try to give her detail and she just doesn't wanna hear it, but she's okay with it. My brother and my dad know and, um, I had to wine and dine him first. I kind of I had to, you know, make sure that they're drunk for the, uh, reveal. And, um, my brother had already known for three years, he was just, like, keeping it a secret. He gave me this burst of laughter and then just, you know, "I... I've already known and... And I'm cool with it." My dad held my hand, gave me a stern, serious look and he said, "It doesn't matter what your occupation is, you're still my daughter." So some of my family knows and most of my friends know. Uh, like some of the older members of my family, I'm waiting specifically until I'm in a pretty good financial position to tell them. I feel like people judge you less about what you do in this industry if you're making enough money to, like, do well for yourself and to do well for your family. I feel like once I'm pretty solid and like, "Oh, I've been here for three years. Oh, by the way I've been editing porn this entire time. Don't be mad at me." I... I had a thing that I could tell people in the vanilla world. When people asked me what I did, I could say, "I breed cats," if I knew that they really would not be okay. I broadcasted my kittens from the time they were born until they... Until they went home and uh, the cats were very popular and my stream, you know, used to get a million views, uh, on average. I found out about Alex's double life, so to speak, probably when I was like 19. A part of me was like, "Is this safe? Is this okay? Should I, you know, not be as close to you when you're doing this?" Like, I just didn't know. She kind of appealed to my science side and knew how much I loved that and would talk to me a lot about the psychology of this and why people feel this way and why this stuff exists. And if you approach me from that way, I'm a lot more receptive to that understanding. She'd show me things online or she would explain why that this fetish exists or why these people did this profession, and it helped me. It helped me a lot and it also opened me to a concept that there were more than traditional types of porn. And once that kind of hit for me, I really didn't... I never became judgmental again, really. Um... I do see a connection between her childhood and what she does for a living, and in the ways that she has a self-importance in real life just as she does in these videos. And I think that happened because she was raised in a situation that required that for her. Growing up was not something I'd like think about much or talk about much. My mom had... had her many mental issues and... And I came to find out some, you know, drug related issues as well. Alex was essentially my mother and I've actually bought her Mother's Day gifts and I've called her my mother-sister hybrid. You know, she... She was that person to me. The things that my mother... That my mother did throughout the course of my childhood, I should have been fucked up. To understand as a kid, I used to have to take money out of her purse when she was sleeping to pay the bills so that we would have hot water or that we would have food or things like that. Like... like, she'd had no functional way really, or functioning, honestly, after... after addiction. I always went through some anger, I know, over it. She saw a lot more than I did. You know, when my parents split I went with my dad, and she wasn't, um, my dad's daughter so we didn't really have the... An ability to see each other. Um, I know that I was really attached to her so, you know, I remember it hurting. I remember it being really hard and uh... Oh, geez, I don't wanna cry. The one thing that our... Rather tumultuous childhood taught us was if you hold on to things from... From your past, it takes up room where love could go. After I had my son and she flew me up here, um, and we were just hanging out and she kind of started to casually line up her business, and um, you know, I didn't... I don't think I got the full scope immediately as she... I think I was definitely fed in a little bit of it. So I think it was a way to kind of reconnect us all together and... and be honest, you know, about what she did. But I feel like the women who really thrive in femdom are women who have either been through adversity or have been through situations that have, like, tried to beat them down and have become stronger for it. Because you're not a woman in any business without having a thick skin and without having a kick ass attitude and surviving. So I have these guys send me a list of pirated videos. When they find them, they'll send 'em to you. - Right, Right. - Anytime you find... I do a thing called DMCAs, which is, uh, essentially a privacy protection and I have to contact, um, the heads of these sites that are illegally taking her videos and using them for their capital gain, um, and kind of send them a request to take it down. Alex described it as, um, you know, mushrooms after the rain. You're constantly chopping 'em down and they're gonna come back. But it's about controlling it. Yeah. This industry porn in general is going more towards bespoke or custom porn. Porn has to change because it will die if we depend on the same model because they're stealing from us. Like, people think, "Oh, yeah, they'll always make porn, ' but it will be shitty porn. Just like they'll always make music, but it will be shitty music because you stole it all. So it's definitely going more towards independent amateur custom porn. But I remember the first few times and it was the same... same producer that kept taking it, or same uploader. And I was like, "If I ever saw this guy in public, I would definitely punch him, like, straight in the face," 'cause it's really disrespectful, you know? Thank you Goddess. First or second date is when I tell people about my job. You know, guys that are my age are not the most confident, especially with the kind of work I'm doing, a lot of the time they're insecure. You know, they think that they're not good enough and it's... it's like, you know, it's work and it's personal relationships and they... you know, guys don't really understand how that is. Everyone knows that you're with me even as I put my hands between a strange man's legs right in front of you all. I've seen girls have their stuff taken down that they've done for years and years because their new boyfriend wants them to do something else. Red flag number one, "Stop doing what you're doing for me," and it's a guilt thing, like, "Oh, well if you love me, do you care about that more than me? Do you care about everyone else's dick more than me?" Like, that's a really manipulative way to approach that. I used to call it stripper boyfriend because that's where I used to see it. They would spend their money and play with the Xbox that they bought them, but then call them a whore at the same time. And it is so common and a lot of people are just like, "I don't date till I retire." It's quite challenging, actually, 'cause you don't know if... if they are interested in you because of your... Of what you do, or if they're really dating you because of who you really are as a person. And I have a really strict 'no dating a client' policy. Very, very strict. I have never broken that rule ever since I started in this business. But, you know, when it comes to me having casual sex and, um, just being me as a girl, it... it's so much fun... It helps. Them knowing that I'm a FemDom and that, you know, it'll be a fun sexual experience, it's always, uh... It always comes in handy when I try to pick up men. I was actually, uh, I was going on a second date with a guy that I kind of, you know, I kind of liked. You know, I hadn't really made up my mind about him yet. And he brags to me that he's told all of his friends, "Oh, I'm going on a date with a dominatrix." And I was like, "And now we have no more date." And he's like, "Why? Well, I just find you really interesting." And I said, "You have distilled me down to my profession, but I am not my job, okay? I put... I breathe life into my job, my job does not breathe life into me." When"s the last time... you were truly happy? Alex likes to care for others. Alex loves to give back to others and support others. Um, but it's a... It's a major problem for me with a lot of the people in her life who don't care for her and support her enough. I fit into Alex's life as her creative other half. Alex and I are each one piece of a happy soul. She's somebody I love so much and to see somebody that you love... heartbroken or struggling and there's nothing you can do to fix it, is really difficult. After Alex left her marriage, uh, she also left the studio and we didn't see her for long periods of time. And when that happened, things really started to change. I would say they really started to go downhill. The way that we'd split the business was that I still maintained ownership of the dungeon. Like all... all the content in the dungeon and its name and the training program that I developed, and that he would operate its day-to-day activities. We were still working the same amount, but we were making a lot less. And I would say we were actually even working harder, putting in more hours, taking more sessions. And I'd look at the schedule and I would see like... Like there'd be nothing for few weeks, and then there'd be all these sessions and nothing for a few weeks. And I'm like, "God, that's gonna be so difficult for the girls to do." Like, I mean, it's... like, it just seemed to be... It seemed to be a lot of work. Joseph is a very charismatic individual. I met Joseph right off the bat, um, when Alex and I were starting to get to know each other, and he is an engaging individual. He's... uh, on the surface, he seems to have it all put together. He seems to be very coordinated. He seems to be very on top of it. If we had a problem, it was Alex who would go and talk to Joseph and, you know, fight the fight. You know, we lost our advocate and Joseph has a very loud voice in a lot of ways and, um, we... We weren't able to stand up for ourselves as well. I sort of felt worried. I started to go, "Okay, well, if I get a phone call tomorrow that, you know, like, the lease hasn't been paid, what am I gonna do? Like, if I get a phone call tomorrow, like, well, about... About, you know, one of the girls wants to quit." And I was realizing I didn't want to run the dungeon the way that I had before. It was exhausting. You know, I'm gonna, unfortunately, have to continue to untie things from him legally. I had kind of left some things here and there because I was like, "Hey, we trust each other and... And, you know, divorce sucks and it's messy. And, like, unraveling a business is messy." And now I have to be aggressive about unraveling these things. I'm gonna have to go in and either exert control over it and reclaim it or decide what's gonna have to go and what's gonna stay. I do feel like, sex work is work... and... you know that people are gonna say you're a whore. "Like you're a fucking whore. Like, oh, you can't... You're so stupid. You... you can't use your talent. So, you... There's nothing going for you. It is where you have to use your body to make money or you have to use sex to make money." And I think that, yes and no, because I feel like I'm smart, because I figured out that I can use this to make money. I built a business. I, you know, I... I pay my taxes. I... I'm a... I'm a legit company, you know? It's not that all sex work is empowering because it's not. But it's not empowering, not because it's sex work, it's not empowering because we do not empower sex workers in our institutions. Let's begin. I want you to take a nice deep breath. These are some of my favorite. These subliminal style videos. Um, they sell really well and, uh, they're a lot of work to make, but they're, like, really trippy to watch. When it comes to what we can and cannot say when we upload clips, um, what we can and cannot use in titles and in descriptions, um, it has more to do with the banks and the credit card companies than it has to do with, um, how we believe the content actually is. The best ways you can serve me is with your financial worship. You're putting them into a mind state, um, where they don't have control over their bodies, and then you can make them... Make them do things that they don't wanna do. Which isn't real, which isn't a true thing about hypnosis. It is a perception about hypnosis that banks and credit card companies don't wanna be associated with. You want to see me... Have everything my heart desires? They work in a certain way. I know because, uh, I fall asleep sometimes while, um, editing them. I can't edit hypno videos after lunch. Good boy. Good boy. There's sort of that myth of the "captain save a hoe'... -With sex workers that... That, "I... I will save them from themselves. These girls, they don't know what they're getting into. They're being taken advantage of." Are... are there women and girls being taken advantage of in the world? Absolutely. Some of it is through sex work. Uh, most of it is through our everyday interactions and institutions. Today we bring, Mr. Speaker, HR 1865 It allows states and victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act or FOSTA to the floor, finally. For too long, bad actor websites have operated with impunity in selling young women and girls forced into the commercial sale of sex. They have misused the Communications Decency Act as a shield to avoid criminal liability in state courts. The intention of FOSTA and SESTA was to limit the avenues in which people could use the internet for sex trafficking, but what actually happened was that it made websites liable for the content that independent people put onto those websites. All of the clip sites and all of the social media sites were immediately very, very frightened. Alex lost her 60,000 follower Instagram account pretty much immediately. So on its face SESTA and FOSTA seemed like a very good idea, but as with most things that affect sex workers it's often rolled up in something that everyone universally thinks is terrible, such as sex trafficking or child pornography. And what it ever fails to address is that people who... who do trade any type of sexual services, legally or illegally, are... are marginalized in it. The biggest thing was that many... many sex workers who had... had transitioned to online or, um, indoor locations for... For sex work, now were forced outdoors. They're now forced in the street. Prosecutors tell me that they would oftentimes prefer to use prostitution laws instead of sex trafficking laws, when charging these websites. FOSTA gives prosecutors the freedom to use both. So one of the pages or websites that was shut down because of SESTA and FOSTA was Backpage, which is an advertising site and a blacklisting site. That is also where, um, adult workers write reviews of clients. You know, people that have been abusive or have harassed them or blackmailed them, so that, you know, no other sex workers have to work with them. And now all this information is lost. A lot of escorts and, you know, doms, or people that are... you know, do that kind of exchange on that site, they're going out with new clients that they've never met before who may have had a bad review and now they're totally in danger. FOSTA combined with the SESTA Walter's amendment that adds back in victim-centered provisions from my original language, will finally create these serious legal consequences. That's kind of the... One of the foundations of working in this industry. Things will change, because the rules change all the time and you don't get a say in whatever is happening at any one point in time. Sites can change what they allow, what fetishes they allow. Um, other sites can change what kind of content that you can talk about in your messages. And sometimes the laws change and unfortunately, because we are not a protected class of anything, we just have to pivot, we just have to switch and we just have to keep going forward. We're not easy people to stand up for. Why in the world do we have an entire class of people for whom it is very easy to consider them less than human because of their life choices? ♪ Hi. I love it. It's so cute. I've had the most insane past ten months of my life ever, and it's all thanks to the industry. I've done more traveling this, you know, past ten or so months than I have in my entire life. ♪ Baby. How are ya? Good, how are you? - How was your flight? - Oh, it was great. - Yeah. - It was very warm. I slept the whole time. The main goal that we had after Vancouver was 25 videos. We're only about halfway there. Just, you know, life got in the way. My other job, I requested to work, you know, three or four days a week and they were still continuing to schedule me for six or seven. To her 30 videos sounds like an astronomical number. I shot 17 videos last week when I was in LA. Yeah, yeah, that looks great. She doesn't yet conceptualized how much content she has to have and how much content she has to make on a regular basis. It's been a little overwhelming. I know I can do it, I just haven't really applied myself. You know, I have all of the materials to do what I need and I'm stalling myself. Um, it's just a matter of putting my own foot down and really doing it. She didn't realize how much work there was. She started to get really overwhelmed and a little bit discouraged and a little bit depressed about it. And, you know, that's my job to go in and be like, "Nope, you're doing great. You're doing great. Keep your head up. You know, everyone's done this. I'm not gonna let you, you know, drown. Don't worry. But I'm also not gonna give you a free pass." Finally. Finally, I have a daughter I can give all of my clothes to. -Just kidding. Thanks sex mom. What's interesting is that the... the best content that is made by... By male producers, at least, specifically inside femdom, seems to be made by... by guys who are inclined to be submissive. And that's just really because they get the kink, right? For the same reason that, like, we get the kink. But honestly, they get the kink better than I do because obviously, the person who's watching it the most often is a male submissive, right? I'll show you what my site is, what it's about and how the shoots generally work. The storylines mostly come from my head. You know, as I said, I'm a sub and... and, uh, I enjoy these types of things, so I spend a lot of time coming up with ideas and, uh, I get a lot... A lot of great clip ideas from the members of the site. And generally what I do is I come up with a list of ideas and, uh, I'd like you to go over and look at them and pick out which ones you like. "Cause obviously, the ones you like more, you're gonna be able to speak better about. You're gonna have fun doing and... Mm-hmm. He had a lot of good ideas. He had, uh, a huge list of prompts to pick from. We're rolling with, "I love knowing that you're sitting at home jerking off alone in your room about to eat your own cum for me." Take one. So you've come to the end of a very long day, haven't you? And you've come to me, to my videos. Like, he's still there behind the camera, and as I'm rattling off and I'm talking and he's shaking his head and giving me a thumbs up and... Or he's, like, laughing a little bit. So that... That really encourages me when I'm in front of the camera and I'm, you know, just making the words. Let me get that little last bit. Just keep going until there's just a little left right here... and you lick that. That felt good, huh? A lot of girls say they can just do this by turning the camera on themselves and not having anyone around, and... So why would they need to go shoot in front of a guy? So it is hard, you know, and I spent a lot of years really trying to build my reputation as someone that girls could feel comfortable around. - That was great. - Okay. Yeah, it was really, really good. By the time I'm... I'm done and I edit it and put it all together, it'll have nice transitions, it'll flow. One thing I've always need to work on when it comes to performing or presenting is talking slower. Actually, your... Your pace was pretty good. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Your delivery was actually... Is actually very, very good. Raevyn is a natural pervert, right? She's gonna conceptualize the... the scenes a lot differently than... than someone who is really playing pretend. Uh, and I think for her, the physical activity of doing things comes a lot easier than just talking about doing things. Okay, uh, we're rolling with, uh, "Satanic blasphemy." Take one. I met Alexandra Snow, uh, I am pretty sure it's been a few years, but I'm pretty sure I reached out and contacted her. Um, she has always been one of the top three Clips4Sale girls, um, you know, and someone I highly... You know, I... I knew would do very well on my site. Were you a good, good little church boy? Did you always do all the right things? All that morality didn't make you very happy, did it? No, it didn't. Very good. And tell me, it does feel good, doesn't it? Touch your cock for me. They told you to beware of women like me. And cut it and move here. - Closer? - Yeah, go ahead. Oh, cut it first... "cause I'm gonna go get a Bible. She gets the mind game. You know, she knows what to say. She knows how to play to the camera. I mean, she... She's the whole package. You know, and not only that, but as... as being a top seller, you know, uh... you know, I just saw it as a complete win for... For my website to have someone who had a big name, um, and who, you know, had lots of followers. I'll read you a little passage right here. "She's a tree of life to them lay hold upon her and happy is everyone that retaineth her" Worshiping me? This is your new salvation. - Okay. - Perfect. That's gonna do really well for me. - That was fantastic. - Yeah. Yeah. Good. Watching Alex shoot and, uh, perform for him, that helped me a lot. She's... she's great. She's very fluid with what she does, so I... I took a few mental notes. I always felt, like, sometimes, when you go down the route of... of religious videos, it collects a little bit of bad karma, you know what I mean? Like, I get a lot of requests where people want me to, like, to piss on the Bible or, you know, to like, rip up pages out of, you know, the Quran and stuff. And I get it. I understand it. It's definitely not for me. It's mostly just because I... I really don't want to downplay anything positive that... That group's culture has ever done for it. And I feel like a lot of... A lot of religion makes you feel ashamed, so maybe that's a good thing to get away from. Also, I just wanna spank people with this bible. . Some people wear that amount of makeup. - Do you like? - That's what I'm saying. Yeah, normally. Alex wanted to keep things very cordial, and, um, open with-with her divorce and... and with her ex she was trying very hard to not rock a boat, to do things smoothly. Um, still owning a business together and still... I mean, they all shared the same friends, you know? Like, it... It's a big life change so I know that she wanted to be as, uh, mature and smooth as possible, initially. So, you know, I... I... I have been really careful up until this point about not wanting to badmouth Joseph. Mostly because it's really easy to look like a vengeful ex and there's kind of no way for me to be able to describe so much of the things that have happened, that I let happen and, you know, I participated in and all that stuff. He wouldn't even let me meet the new staff, let alone train them. I'm not gonna have my name attached to any of that. Like, I've worked... Worked too hard, uh, to build... To build the... The ethical foundation that the whole place has been run on, right? When Alex was gone, um, where we were encouraged to take sessions that we wouldn't normally take, um, indulge in fetishes that were not necessarily our bag, um, film custom videos that weren't necessarily something that we would normally do. And I think a lot of that had financial reasons. You know, we... we were encouraged to not ever say no. I'll put it that way. The entire arrangement that we had was that, you know, I... I was... I was going to help transition the business, the... the one portion of the business over to him and then, you know, go into my... Into my business, um, and still stay involved, you know, with the dungeon and stuff. And... and he just... Things with Joseph now are quite... Quite odd. Um, Joseph on the surface will tell Alex one thing, but then his actions will say a different thing. Joseph on the surface will say, you know, "Hey, I'm going to sign these papers," or, "I'm going to do this, this and this for the business." And Joseph on the other hand, will not do any of those things and continue to put things off and delay as long as he can. Even when Alex asks him, you know? You know, he started lying outright to me about... Lots of things that changed, the passwords locked me on. Like, I... I was half expecting to, you know, go in and find that the dungeon door's locked or something like that. A lot of us were being played off Alex and, um... I think that was very carefully crafted. I think that was a calculated move, and that's really where I started to question things. Um, I dunno what's gonna happen with... With... with the dungeon in its current form, but at this point, the point that I'm currently at, um, I... I might just fucking close it. I'm usually the one who's directing it as well as being in it. If I have you in a position, I have you doing something and like something doesn't feel right or, you know, like, something that's going wrong, - just speak up and tell me. - Okay. Um, in the videos, you know, call me... call me Goddess, or call me Ms. Snow or call me, ma'am. And if we need to stop rolling for any particular reason, you can always say stop, or just talk to me. - I... I'll manage it for you. - Okay, cool. - Sound good? - Yeah. Great. I first discovered femdom, basically it was... It was a gradual shift in, like, how I browsed porn and sort of discovered my sexuality. First my mind was blown, I was like, "Wait, like, the roles could be reversed, Like the man can be dominated in... in these scenarios?" And my first thought was like, "That's not okay. That's not how like things should work. Uh, I want to grow up to be this, like, tough, strong, like, dude figure that just, like, reams his penis into everything." Uh, uh, thank you Goddess. Delving into that was cool. And then I stumbled on an instructional video. Slow, slow... It was, like, more interactive, I guess. It was more stimulating for my brain. I'd be instructed on like, I guess, how to masturbate, which I thought was kind of cool. And from there I ended up on one of Domina Snow's hypnosis videos. Ten... nine... And it just ended on, like, me having to eat my cum and it was just like, "Wait, what the fuck is happening here?" The crisis that I had after I discovered that I, like, really enjoyed this content and I would watch it at least once or twice a week, was like, how would I ever find someone in my life that would, like, think that this is, like, an okay thing for me to do? Telling friends like, "Oh, this is what I'm into and this is, uh, how I express my sexuality." Uh, will I be hooded for the scene itself? - Would you like to be hooded? - Yeah. Okay. Absolutely. Just like, I... it's mostly, like, family worries like that, like, it'll, like, make it to them somehow, that it's, like, obviously me. I was doing, like, my usual, like, Saturday night after-party, like, popping on my, like, specific Domina Snow Twitter and just scrolling through it. And I saw the blog post, like, "Hey, if you're in LA or San Diego, we're doing shoots. Uh, applications for this wonderful opportunity." And I was like, "Hell fucking, yeah." Like I get to meet my favorite dominatrix, I get to shoot with her. There was no, like, real second thoughts at first, but when she responded to me affirmative, I'm like, "Wow, this is... This is really happening." Tell me when you're ready. I'm both extremely excited with a tad of, like, just extreme, like, butterflies in my stomach. I'm... I'm very like, nervous. ♪ You gonna be good for me? - Yes, Goddess. - Yeah? You wanna make sure that you'll... obey every command? Yes, Goddess. And Domina Snow's content, it really feels like it's really been practiced and there's been like research into how the psyche works and how certain triggers are used in sexuality. And I would say it feels like there's intention in like every shot. It... it just feels like... -high quality content. Good boy. Like you kept your arms there. Oh, I'm so impressed. Scoot over here. They come in and have this, kind of, like, they put me on a pedestal and I'm larger than life and I wanna live up to that. But I also wanna live up to that in a way that shows them that I'm a real person and I care about them, not just I'm this fantasy that they've, you know, kind of concocted. So do you have any ideas for things that you really like to... Like to do or try? I wanna try some CBT, definitely want to do that. So CBT stands for cock and ball torture or cock and ball torment. So these are instructional videos often along... like, masturbation instructions too, where I have them assemble things from around the home and then instruct them on how to do it. Sometimes, I'll even have like a dildo that has like balls on it and like "here's how you wrap this, and do this thing," and I kind of help them to lead along with it. What do we have in here? So have you done, like, self-bondage? So, like, cock-ball-bondage? How do you... How do you fare there? I... I was trying it again, like, last night before this. Stick your tongue out. Let's see. Oh yeah. I've like been able to tie the entire thing up. I've done the rubber band one, where, like, you're basically, like, your cock is just encased in like rubber bands. That was pretty intense. I've gotten to, like, maybe seven close pins on my balls. It's a pretty good number. There's not a lot of room there. You say you got to seven before? Yes, Goddess. Oh good, "cause we're getting to eight. - Thank you, Goddess. - Yeah. There we go. Although, um, I'm... This is all gonna be authentic and real, um, because I don't have a history of playing with you, I'm gonna probably increase the severity as we go. And so it's gonna be really important that you communicate with me. It's better that you communicate with me even if you feel like it's gonna somehow screw up the video rather than... Than just, like, hold it and take it. The thing that I really don't wanna happen is like, don't do the typical, like, guy thing of, like, "Oh, I'm just gonna take whatever you have and I'm gonna be stoic and... And... and non-responsive." Like, the more responsive you are, the better I'm able to reach you. - Mm-hmm. - There we go. I'm like a cat. If... if it doesn't make noise then I'm just not very interested in it. Some of the slave content was a little hard for me to edit at first, um, because I'm kind of an... Like an empathetic person, so it's like, "Oh, uh, uh," you know? But eventually, like you kinda get over it. And especially talking to these guys after they do sessions like that and they're like, "Man, that was great! That was something I totally wasn't expecting." Or like, they've got this sort of high afterwards and that's what they look for in that fetish. So, I know that this is what these guys are looking for, so I don't feel bad editing it anymore. He did such a great job. He... he really did a great job. And then he was young and he was a college student, and either they're like super gung ho and like really, really into it or they're absolutely terrified, have no experience whatsoever. And I was really excited when he arrived that it seemed to be the former. Cut. Good job. How're you feeling? - How're you doing? - All right. Good. Wow. That was an experience. I am so happy and when I go on with my day and, uh, I feel glowing, basically. One of the many considerations that I have, like, going through my studies and, like, looking at my future careers, uh, outside of, like, food, housing, a happy family, is like being able to afford to visit a professional dominatrix and have experiences like these. ♪ Oh... do I love... being a man eater? You wanna take a big cock like this because I told you to? It just turns me on so much to think of you with another guy. You know, come to think of it, maybe you should get on Grindr right now. I can tell after opening my stores I was... I was able to upload a clip every single day for about two weeks. I noticed that, you know, if I were to upload every single day, five or six days a week, I'm gonna do great. I can see that in my sales and, you know, it shows me all these graphs and it helps things make sense to me. Have you ever been to a Bikini Barista before? No? Well, they're one of my favorite places to go get coffee. I mean, why wouldn't you wanna -come get coffee from me? So tell me how it's going. Um, let's see. I actually haven't filmed in a couple weeks. I did go to Portland and I filmed - Okay. - With somebody down there. I know I'll do... I'll do well as long as I fully dedicate myself, and I can't even dedicate myself halfway when I'm spending four days a week working coffee. I'm... I'm just a little nervous about leaving a job. Like, you know, being... I'm going to do it. I just... it's a little scary. Well, of course it's scary, but this... But you already have a job, this is just investing more time in a job that you own... - Yeah. - Versus, you know, a job that somebody else owns and you're working for them. If it was me, I could... I could do both jobs... but I don't know the me at 22 could have done both jobs. She's proud of me, she tells me she's proud of me all the time, which helps me a lot and makes me feel good and I appreciate that. That's pretty much all I really need, is to, you know, keep getting encouragement from the people I'm close to. I did notice your... Like your staging looks better and, you know, like the stuff you shot, uh, in, a nice hotel room. I still don't know if I'm going to be strictly dom, so we will... You know, I... I don't know... I don't know what I'm gonna look like. Sure. And the great thing is... Is that you can grow - and evolve and change. - Yeah. - Like, no one's gonna stop you. - Yeah. I hope to have empowered an entire generation of women... who choose sex work because it's the vocation they want, not because they felt like they had no other options in life. That's what I really wanna see. Certainly that's probably the reason that I'm training Raevyn the way that I am, right? Like... like I wanna see her take on the mantle and be the next generation and then I wanna see her do what I'm doing and train someone else. Nip slip! We rented the Stimson-Green Mansion and we did photo shoots. - I like that. - Yeah, yeah. We had Sarah Skinner as the photographer, who is an amazingly talented artist and also really hardcore. She's just really, really intense. ♪ Honestly, she was the right person to wrangle all these doms "cause, you know, she's like, "All the things you think you know, we're not doing any of them. You know, we're gonna make really different things." I think this industry is incredible. The women and men involved that I have been exposed to and... and have actually become friends with are an incredibly diverse cast of people. They're all incredibly well-spoken and intelligent. Um, they're very well read. It's kind of a breath of fresh air because they're all kind of taking the world at their own pace. They're doing what they want in the world. They're shaping their life to be exactly what they want it to be. And that's... that's it, girl, come on. I grew up with very bad skin and very flamboyant fashion sense. So I was known as the weirdo. I didn't know where I belonged, didn't have a lot of friends. I don't feel like you need these. And then I find out everybody loves that I'm weird, and that I open my big mouth or I stand up for people or whatever. This industry is a really good reminder that, "No, we like you "cause you're you." That's the best. -Yeah, come on. Come on! Because of the way this society is organized because of the. Bring your head... I want you to look at her. Look at her. It's a labor of love, being able to serve amazing women, being able to play a part in amazing things such as this event and hopefully make... Make them happy. Real fucking hot and um... I feel like this is, like, a... a Dolce and Gabbana. You know, this is about enjoying what you enjoy and turning that into good work and... And just making everything nice for everybody else. Yeah, good job guys. -Whoo! It's a group of strong independent women who are kinky and very liberated and free spirited at the same time, and it's a good mix. - Thank you. - Thanks. We"re in a really unique, weird industry and I think that if you don't have friendships within it, you're gonna go fucking crazy. It could be really, really lonely. The umbrellas? I was going to get food. I'm very thankful that I do have these women that even if we don't see each other, but once a year, I can still message them. Or when I see them, it feels like no time has passed and we have this connection and they advise me on things. And I value their opinion on everything "cause they understand completely what... What we're all going through. Get ready for the internet to hate you guys. . I believe when the majority of the people in the industry have passionately, you know, confidently chosen what they do, then the landscape of that industry changes radically. And... that's what I really... I really hope to see. I don't want you guys holding your backs. You know, at the end of the day, we're people like anyone else. So, you know, most of the women are really cool, down to earth and just rad human beings. I mean, that's the least I could say about Alex. Alex is fucking awesome in... in so many ways. -No rules! No... no rules? No, that means you say it. I love the women in this community. They have made me feel so accepted and so loved just because they see in me the same kind of qualities that drive them as like business women, and they've really accepted me into the group and I love them a lot. They talk about being goddesses "cause they are. They're powerful women. I have such an incredible sense of belonging. I've never had that before. You know, I've never had a group that I fit in with and I've never had my people, and... and these are my people. I have the best support system imaginable and all of... All of these people are really close. You know, it's not just, like, they're friends on... online or they're friends for... for the photos. You know, we all have really strong close connections. The only people that do lobby for sex work... sex worker rights tend to be other sex workers. And it's too easy to label us as being the undesirables of, you know, of... of society, and therefore our voices don't make a difference. The thing I had wanted to do for some time was I wanted to build a... an independent collective model... Business collective model in which that all of the... The people inside that as... as sex workers were all their own individual businesses and that they got to make the decisions for themselves. When Alex was, like, in the final stages of her divorce, like we had... We had summoned him to court many times. He didn't show up and so finally the judge was just like, "All right, Alex, you're divorced." "You get all the stuff that you want in the divorce because Joseph never showed up." In the process of leaving Wicked Eden in the place that it was before with Joseph, we started The Wicked Collective together. Um, both her and I are equal share owners in the Wicked Collective and I am the director of operations there. I think the collective will continue to grow. Uh, I'm excited to teach other girls the things that I know and the things that I've learned through my experiences. We just had to dismiss one of our sad little slaves. - Mm. Yeah. - Didn't we? I'm excited to grow my business in production. I hope the people watching this documentary are inspired to go home and do some kinky dirty shit. It will be a different dungeon, uh, when we buy our new place, um, but the collective will... Will persist no matter what Wicked Eden ever looks like. Wicked Collective will always be the group that, um, is... It is formed around it and empowers and upholds each other. Since starting the documentary, one of the things that I promised myself was that I would stop... I would stop lying to people, um, that I didn't know well. You know, like when... You know, like you... There's lots of people that you're gonna be faced with, that, um, that, like, you know, ask you, "Well what do you do for a living?" sort of thing. And I always gave them a very, like, acceptable answer. You know, "I work in a production company," or you know, like, whatever, "I do life coaching, you know, I breed cats." Um, and I just stopped. I like just stopped trying to protect people's feelings and just be authentic. And I thought, I'm gonna deal... I'm gonna be dealing with a lot of shit this year. I'm just gonna deal with a lot of people's... A lot of stigma and their stereotypes and everything else, but you know what? I've really encountered very little of it. I've encountered so much support and acceptance and people being, like, "That's amazing. I have some questions for you." And, like, and then calling me and asking me things about their lives and, like, their kinks, and like, it just felt so good to just be able to just be you, you know? So I'm... I'm glad you're doing it. Yeah. Doing this basically means that I'm gonna have to be somewhat public about how I feel about this. Like my best friends and roommates need to know about this at the very least, I can't just keep up this facade about like who I am and how I enjoy my sexuality and pleasure. Look at your face. It makes such a good foot stool, doesn't it? Wearing a mask is uncomfortable and it was probably, um, obscuring his ability to like, to see me and, like, interact with me in a way that felt... Like, felt more... more natural. He just said, "I'd preferred to... to do it with it off," and, uh, and I said... I said, "Is it just uncomfortable?" and he goes, "I just feel like I don't need it." And we had also just kind of had a conversation about the fact that, you know, um, I was kinda coming out with my identity as part of... As part of the documentary, and I feel like that may have inspired him a little bit to feel like, "Hey, if you're doing it, I can too. I can... You know, if your face is on this thing, I can do it as well." I wish our society at large was more comfortable being honest about their sexual desires. America's porn watching habits or their search history is it tells a totally different story from what we would show to our friends or show to our partners. . Thank you, Goddess. ♪ I really think if we"re gonna move America forward to be more sex positive, then what we need to do is, one, integrate this into our education system. We need a comprehensive sex ED system that goes K-12 and beyond and really talks about just consent and communication and, you know, ownership of our own bodies and our own selves and gives us agency to say yes or no. - Happy Pride! - Happy Pride! -Mwah! I want people who are thinking about getting into sex work or early into sex work, to know that there are other people out here doing this thing and in groups. You don't have to be alone. Uh, you don't have to do it all on your own. And uh, there... There's a safe way to do it. There's a safe way to do sex work and... and it's okay. I think this country sees the women in the industry as deviants and degenerates, when they're real people doing real jobs. And sex workers are real workers. Sex work is real work and sex work should be empowered. They shouldn't be persecuted for what they do. And I feel like very soon there may be a time where the world looks at sex workers and goes, "You know, hey, maybe... Maybe we've been wrong this whole time." I make a great living off of this character, this persona who embodies a lot of my own traits, but also, you know, has to, like, make them larger than life. I feel like the big thing is... Is that your clients, your fans, they are so... so convinced that your life and your... And who you are needs to be exactly this fantasy archetype. That you are not a real person, you are a comic book character. I love people who like think that I... I... I might wear something like this around my house. I had to bring this, I had to bring all this stuff from my studio, bring it here, and this doesn't even live here. None of this stuff lives here. I... I don't want it to. I want my normal clothes. I want my... my normal life with sweaters and shit to live here. See this? This? This is amazing. This is a dress made out of unicorns. Yep, and I can't wait to wear this in a picture and someone... and someone say, "Oh, but Goddess, I miss you were in... You were wearing latex and leather and stuff." And I'll be like, "Bitch, I'm in my unicorn dress. I look amazing." Alex is going to be coming out with her name on the documentary and that's going to be a step in normalizing sex work, so people don't think that they have to use stage names and they can use their real name because it is a job and this is something that a lot of people could do. Who makes things legitimate? It's not some magical, like, external force, it's the people inside that industry. Inside of that field who say, "We will legitimize ourselves." And the only way to do that is to present to the outside world that you are worthy of it. My name is Jamie, but it's still Goddess to you.
