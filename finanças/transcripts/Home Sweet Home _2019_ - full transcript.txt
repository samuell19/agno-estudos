(Mekong Delta I 1990) Where did you go? Bring me some more betel nuts. Yes madam, one moment. If I don't win this round, I'm your servant! See? I said I would win. One, two, three... Damn, bad cards. (Home Sweet Home) Be careful, son. Husband! Oops, I thought you could climb up by yourself. Stop always thinking I can do everything! Nanny! Come and get Tam's baggage. Nanny, hurry up! Gosh, you're so slow! Here... Who paid for the hospital fee? Who else but us? I had to borrow from some relatives in the city. We should pay them back as soon as possible! Money you can earn back sooner or later, but we have only one heir. If anything bad happens to him, how can we answer to our ancestors? Right, nephew? Do you feel better? Yes, I feel better now. What the hell are you doing? He is still recovering. If you keep breathing your whiskey breath on his face, he's going to get your germs! Your nephew is just out of hospital. You don't help anything, drinking all the time. Cousin Hai! Come here and play! - Aren't the flowers beautiful? - Yes, so beautiful. Look! I'll keep the leaf. - Okay, let's go! - Go! Cousin Hai! Are you okay? - Nephew, are you okay? - I'm fine. Isn't it good to be home? Yes. Thien Tam? Yes? Are you ready to see your grandpa? Dad, Tam is back. Your grandpa doesn't remember anything anymore. His eyesight has gone, and his health is weakening day by day. I think your grandpa... he won't live pass this year. Tam. In this family, your grandpa loves you most. Why has he become like this? When your grandpa heard about your accident, he had a stroke. Your mother and I had to use all the money we had to keep him alive. I did all I could! I'm sorry dad. - It's my... - Don't blame yourself. Just get some rest... and then tell your grandpa to give you the deed of the land. We need to sell it to pay our debts. If the creditors come here to collect... it will be so humiliating. - This is for you. - Thanks, cousin. This grasshopper is beautiful! Look, it's dancing! ♪ Two poles make a ladder holding up a pumpkin, ♪ ♪ The poles stick together, always supporting ♪ ♪ An oil man crossed the bridge and died... ♪ ♪ So why did the frog man still stay alive? ♪ ♪ The duck is drumming, his trumpet toots... ♪ ♪ While the cuckoo plays along on his flute ♪ How's it going? Did your father say anything? What could he say? He's just lying there like a corpse. I don't know, even if he dies we still have to wake him up to resolve this. You don't know anything! He will only give it to Thien Tam now. If you want to get it, you need to let his grandson wake him up gradually. Don't you remember what the doctor said? I don't care. Whatever you do, just give me more money. What did you just say? I couldn't hear you. Are you deaf? I said you need to give me more money! Has alcohol made you lose your mind? Who lost their mind? - You should remember... - Stop it! We don't have the money yet and we're already fighting. Yeah, right. Your family is happily together now so you want to kick me out. - Don't forget about Hai Lam... - Brother Ut! Dad, why is Hai Lam's room locked? You are still recovering, what are you doing here? What if you get sick again? I'm fine dad. Your father is right. Why don't you rest in your room? Why are you here? Mom, did something happen to Hai Lam? Okay, fine. I'll tell you. Hai Lam, she... your grandpa kicked her out. Why was she kicked out? Sixteen years old, pregnant and unmarried! She disgraced our family! How could that happen? If she was dating anyone, she definitely would have told me! Plus the day I got the accident, grandpa had a stroke. How could he kick her out? Are you calling us liars? I wouldn't dare. It happened right on the day of your accident. Your grandpa was already in shock with what Hai Lam did, then the news of what happened to you sent him over the edge. Son, the six months you were in a coma, a lot of bad things happened to our family. I already told him. Mom, so why did uncle Tu stop being the butler to work as a boatman? We don't have the money to pay for uncle Tu anymore, so we had no choice but to let him go. A penny saved is a penny earned. Just go and rest well. When you are fully recovered, we will tell you everything. I saw something in the mirror! - What did you see? - I saw... Nanny. Nanny. Son, it's daytime. Nothing can happen. Tam. It's been a long time since our whole family had dinner together like this. Eat son, this is all your favorite food. Eat up before it gets cold! Yes. Dad, mom and uncle Ut, please enjoy. God damn it, there is only one chicken leg for my son! Who allowed you to take it? And you dropped it too! I'll knock your head off! What the hell! Why are you crying? There are head, neck or wings, why don't you eat those? Gosh! I can't even have dinner because of you. Why don't you just die with your mother? Leave her, just eat dear. I... I want to go looking for cousin Lam. Dear God in heaven! Do you even know where to look for her? Even her own father doesn't know where she is! But I'm very worried about her. Even if you knew where she is, what's the point? You want to bring her back to provoke your grandpa or what? What you told me, I find it difficult to believe. I want to hear from her with my own ears. And the weird thing I saw in the mirror. I told you that you are recovering. You were too tired and just seeing things. - But I... - Don't argue with your father! You have to listen to me! I'm full, please excuse me dad, mom, uncle Ut. Please continue. Tam! Tam! I told you to stay calm. - Nanny Nam. - Yes? Tomorrow get rid of all the mirrors in this house. Yes. Actually, I miss her more than you do Tam. But I think... she is guilty as hell! If she continued to live here, she would be better off dead. I don't believe cousin Lam is guilty. She was born a girl. For your grandpa, that's already her biggest sin. But cousin Lam had no choice in that. Besides, she is your daughter anyway. Honestly, I never blamed her. If there's anything to blame... it's her unlucky fate to be born into this family. Anyway, let's change the subject. I want to ask, your birthday is coming up, how do you want to celebrate it? If cousin Lam isn't here, I don't want to celebrate it. That's up to you. Uncle Ut! Tomorrow... can you help me make a telegram to the city, announce that I'm back home and will celebrate my birthday? So who knows, maybe cousin Hai Lam will come back. Hai Lam is your daughter, don't you care about her? It's late. Go to sleep. We'll discuss it later. I need to ask your parents and your grandpa's opinion. Cousin Hai, wake up. Cousin! Hai Lam? Don't make a noise, if my dad hears I will get in trouble. Let's go and catch fireflies! Cousin Hai, hurry up! I'm sorry to make you sad, Hai. Where did you go? Let's go home, Hai Lam. I won't go home. Grandpa doesn't let me. I am here now. I won't let anyone bully you anymore. The fireflies over there are so beautiful, cousin Hai. Hai Lam? Hai Lam, where are you? An oil man crossed the bridge and died... (Optical Fluidity) Tam, what are you doing here? I want to go inside the shrine to burn incense. Why is this door locked? I locked it. I know burning incense for our ancestors is your duty, but the doctor said you are weak. You shouldn't be exposed to fumes and smoke. So who will pray for the family? You just get some rest, your father will take care of it. I'm going to school. Auntie Hai, please let me go to school with my cousin. Why would a girl want to study? To learn how to write love letters to boys or something like that? I hate you, you've been neglecting me lately. Adorable! You smell so good! So good! Are you playing hard to get? Are you playing hard to get? Hard to get! Hard to get! - You're so strange! - Hard to get! - No playing... - I'm so dead! I'm so dead! Anyone, please help! Help... Help, help! Anyone, please help! Tam, I forbid you to tell what just happened to your mother. You already promised to grandpa... In manhood, we have four big addictions. This is the least of them. Why do you care so much? But don't you think it's strange? I have never had trouble swimming before. I already told you, you are still so weak. Don't just wander around. Do you see now? What have you done to your children and grandchildren? I'm speaking honestly, Dad... I'm bored with this house. He's drunk again. Why is he the only heir? Where is Hai Lam? Come to buy more wine for your dad! - Crazy bastard! - You motherfucker! Leave him, son. Go inside and get changed. All you have to do is buying wine for your dad and you can't even do that! That's why people look down on you, and they look down on your dad too! Giving birth to you is my biggest mistake! - Who's that? - Nanny... Nanny Nam here. I put your clothes outside. Go. Grandpa, I want to give you this. Grandpa. Grandpa, are you missing cousin Lam? I miss her too. Please forgive her, Grandpa. She's all alone outside, Grandpa. Poor her. Tam! If I was at home, she wouldn't have been kicked out, right? It's all in the past now, why carry it with you? You are still sick. - Uncle Tu, I have something to ask you. - Yes? What is it? Why did you come here to be a boatman? It's partly my fault. But I don't want to talk about it anymore. ♪ An oil man crossed the bridge and died ♪ ♪ So why did the frog man... ♪ Uncle Tu, do you hear Hai Lam's singing voice? Hear what? Well, it's dinner time. Let's go home, your parents must be worrying. We can't leave this much longer. Whatever you do, do it quickly. Don't push us! We are the ones with the biggest pressure here. If you weren't an alcoholic, our family wouldn't be in this mess. Are you saying you're a good son? About breaking the family, I'm not sure who is the worst... Come on! This house owes a lot of debt and both of you are to blame! What about you? Do you think I don't know about your debts from card games? Stop it, brother Ut! I've already reminded you, whatever you do, just make sure I will get this. Do it quickly, or that old man will either give the deeds to his 2nd line relatives, or he will die suddenly. In both cases, we will all become beggars. He is so weak lately. You're an animal! It's your fault dad is like this! I'm telling you... Even if you had 72 magical powers, you'll never find those papers! Why are you doing this, Dad? If you die, you think you can take it with you? You bastard! Luckily, I'm blind now, so I don't have to see your mongrel faces. Yes, I cannot bring it with me. But I won't let an alcoholic, a gambler and a playboy exhume my ancestor's graves and sell the land! So don't think about this family's land anymore. Since Thien Tam turned out to be this way, I already sent the telegram to tell Uncle Hai, from the second line of the family. Tomorrow, he will come to collect the papers. From now on, he will take care of our familiy's graves. Get away from me. Get away! Go! Which bastard dares to search my room? Speak! Where have you put it? If I feed a dog, he won't bite me! You're worse than a dog! You! How dare you I'm your father! Have you ever considered me your son? Insolent! God will punish you! Thien Tam... Are you back? Come here with your grandpa, Lucky. Come here, Grandson. You... You... Do you think I'm stupid? I know it's you, Hai. Who's that? It's night. What were you doing in the garden? Tam, my dear, you need to remember you are still sick. If you collapse out there, what will happen? You must take care of yourself. We don't forbid you to do anything. We just worry about your health. Dad, I don't want to argue with you. But you and mom keep avoiding my questions. Why is someone burning offerings? And what happened to Hai Lam? What are you hiding from me? Keep calm and sit down. Sit down! What would we hide from you? This afternoon I talked to uncle Tu. What did he say? Nothing. Uncle Tu only talked about the time when I got treated in the city hospital. I also went to Grandpa's room. He forgave Hai Lam. So tomorrow morning, I will ask him to take me to the city and look for Hai Lam. Tam. Tam! Damnit! Who knows what the hell Tu told him! Brother Ut is right, we cannot delay any longer! Hai Lam, is that you? What did you say? Sir... I didn't say anything, Mr. Hai. We didn't tell the cops on you, so you should be grateful. Sir, I know that I owe you a great deal. You know it, so keep your mouth shut! If I ever see you gossiping again, don't blame me for what happens. Are we clear? Yes, Sir, I understand. Tam, what are you doing? Stop it! Tam, please stop, dear. Tam! Stop it now! Lam is dead! When you went to the city to get treated, she suddenly went crazy. She always locked herself in her room. No one thought she would do something so stupid. Because you are still so weak, we decided not to tell you until you are fully recovered. Can you not be like this? The dead cannot come back. Lam... Where is she buried, Mom? Mang Thit. The graveyard for other lines and girls of this family. When you're fully recovered, dad and I will take you there. I want to stay here for a bit. Mom, you can go. I'll be okay. Don't blame everyone. The family just cares about your health. Rest soon. Why are you sleeping here? Nanny, you don't have to avoid me anymore. Mom told me everything. Really? Mrs. Hai told you everything? It's all my fault. If I was at home... Cousin Lam would have confided in me. She wouldn't have felt so desperate to commit suicide. Suicide? No, it's not true! Nanny Nam, where are you? I've got to go! If Mrs. Hai sees me talking to you, I'll get in trouble. - Nanny... - I've got to go! About cousin Hai Lam, if you want to know, go to the attic. Just don't let anyone know. Nanny... Nanny Nam! Uncle Hai, I apologize. I don't dare to ask cousin Hai to go out again. An apology isn't enough. You need to be punished. Yes. Your mother died, and your dad doesn't know how to raise you. If your uncle Hai won't teach you, who will? Dad, please. You don't want me to teach you? Okay, fine. She is your daughter. I'll let you teach her. Do what you feel is right. Dad... please, Dad... Dad... please, Dad... Dad... Dad... Why do you let your cousin carry hot things? Mom, It was me. I wanted to carry it. It's not her fault. I told you many times, if Nanny Nam doesn't do it, it's Hai Lam's duty! Go! You are the only heir of the whole family. You need to know your place. Why are your eyes so swollen? Are you okay? Didn't you sleep well last night? - Yes... - Nanny Nam, make two omelettes for Tam. Yes. Dad, Mom, Uncle Ut. What happened? Why did you guys wake up so early? This morning we went to see your grandad. - We wanted to ask him- - Brother Ut. Tam is your nephew. Why are you beating around the bush? Son, it is your birthday. - Do you remember what grandpa promised to you? - Yes? He promised to give you the deeds when you turned 22 years old. Remember to put on a happy face. Why are you so sad? Well, I... Dad, today we are alll here, including me and my wife, - Brother Ut Nghia... - Thien Tam. - Thien Tam, grandson! - I'm here, Grandpa. Your Thien Tam is here. Thien Tam. Dad... I think today you should give your only heir all your fortune. It is time. Grandpa. Dad. Excuse me, but I can not accept. What are you saying? What? Dad, Mom, Uncle Ut. Please, let me deny the position of heir. Hey! Are you kidding me? Brother Ut. Son, why are you talking like this? Your grandpa loves you. He is gifting you this, you must accept! If you refuse, he will give it to the second line! Our family will be left penniless! Tam, hurry up! I'm sorry Dad, Mom. You wanted to see your only heir. We brought him back from hospital for you. What else do you want? And you? You want to play games? Tam, this time, I can't take your side. Apologize to your grandad and tell him to give you the papers! Mom! Grandpa... Dad, damnit! I can't understand you anymore! We did everything you wanted! You have to keep your word. For God's sake! Okay, fine! If you don't give it to us, we will find it ourselves! Dad... Uncle Ut... what are you two doing? Why are you looking? Last time, we searched everywhere and couldn't find anything. - Dad. - You stay there! Thien Tam... Thien Tam... Uncle Ut, what are you doing? Damn! Go to hell! Motherfucker! You show up after I lost my voice calling for you! Are you deaf? Uncle Ut, please calm down. Get away! Uncle Ut, stop! He is dying! You already... killed... Hai Lam. Now you want... to kill me too? Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Why? Why have you all become like this? What else are you hiding from me? Son, calm down and we will talk. What are you doing? Do you want to kill your mother? I just want to know why Hai Lam died! - Put that down! - My son. Let me go! Let me go! Tie him up to stop his madness! Tam, dear. Please eat. Nanny... Grandpa said the whole family killed Hai Lam. Is it true? I can't talk, dear. I beg you, please tell me. Dear, I owe a lot to Mr. and Mrs. Hai. I cannot betray them. Please forgive me, my dear! This is my gift to you. It will help me to protect you from now on. Two poles make a ladder holding up a pumpkin. The poles stick together, always supporting. No patient should be discharged so early. The illness is still quite serious. It should be left to the city's hospital, having professional care... is better this way. What do you mean, "still quite serious"? Are you still experiencing hallucinations? Okay, fine. I'll tell you the truth. Hai Lam, the poor little girl. Six months ago, you and her went out to the river. Hai Lam fell down into the water and was drowning. You couldn't save her. Cousin Hai, help me! From that day, your mind became muddled. Crazy. Your mother and I had to bring you to the city for treatment. I... I'm sorry. Me, your mother, your uncle Ut, none of us is mad at you. If you remembered this, you would become crazy again. So I forbid everyone in this family to mention it again. Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Hai Lam... My God, Hai Lam... Hai Lam. Hai Lam, where are you? - Brother... help me. - Hai Lam! Nanny! I'm in pain! Hai Lam... Cousin Hai. Hai Lam. Cousin Hai. Cousin Hai, please help me! You rest here. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back right away. We cannot keep waiting. Let's sneak in dad's room. Don't let Ut know. No way! He's very fierce and short-tempered. If he finds out, he will kill us both! Kill us? Isn't this a bit immoral? Immoral? I'm dad's firstborn, the rightful heir. I'm just taking what belongs to me. What's wrong with that? Grandpa. My grandchild. It's me, Grandpa. - Grandpa... - Don't let them know. - I'm afraid... - Just follow my words, dear. Grandpa, please come with me. Promise me. Promise. Yes, I promise. I promise. My grandchild. You... You go get... Get... Get... the calendar. It's about time... It's time. You must get what belongs to you. Go to the shrine. You will get the answer that you need. Grandpa, I must get you away from here. Go! Go! - Grandpa... - Go! Thien Tam. Hai Lam. Hai Lam. Thien Tam. Your grandpa apologizes to you both. Dad. Dad. Gosh! Dad! Why are you doing this? Gosh! Fire! Dad! Thien Tam. Thien Tam. Thien Tam. Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Hai Lam! Your're alive! Thien Tam. Thien Tam. Thien Tam. Gosh! Go to the hell! Go to hell, you evil bitch! Die now! Don't be scared. I'm right here to protect you now. Cousin Hai, please don't go, stay with me. The duck is drumming... the poles stick together... An oil man crossed the bridge and died... Thien Tam. Where is my only heir? Hai Lam, good girl. Don't cry. I will not let anyone bully you again. Thien Tam. Dad, don't worry. In a few days, I'll bring Tam back to you. She is still not in a clear mind. She is still calling herself Thien Tam. Be careful, son. Husband! Oops, I thought you could climb up by yourself. Stop always thinking I can do everything! Dad! Why did you do that? Why would you rather die than give me that? Fire! Fire! Put it out! Put it out! God damn it! Put it out! Gosh! Dad! Hai Lam. Hai Lam. Give me back the papers! Where are you going, dear? Hand them over to your uncle Hai. Give me them. Now! Mr. Hai. I already kept quiet... and did many wrong things for you. But today, even if I die, I need to do the right thing. You dare to go against me? - Run, dear. - Nanny! Go! Against me? Fire! Fire! Put it out! Put it out! Hai Lam. Are you abandoning your dad? You are stubborn, like your mother. Always arguing with me! Arguing with me! Go. Quick! Hai Lam! Hai Lam!
