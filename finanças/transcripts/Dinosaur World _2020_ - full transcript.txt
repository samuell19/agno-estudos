Verifying behavioral functionality. Alpha testing complete. The total immersion VR game, "Dinosaur World," is almost ready for release. Five million will be awarded to the participants of the upcoming closed beta, the ultimate test of program effectiveness. 20 players will be selected at random to compete in our pioneering gaming experience. Survive the game and share in the grand prize. Everyone is welcome to enter "Dinosaur World." Have you figured out how to pay your tuition next semester? We've tried about everything, but it's hopeless. Just can't afford it. So that's that. Game over. See you around. Go ahead. No way. Down. Go down. Right. Move right. - Yes! - Let's get a drink. - Can I get water? - Water. - Soda. - Soda. It's Peter. See what he says. Peter! What do I owe the pleasure of your call? I hear you and Lily are going to be beta testing Russell's new game. You have your own gaming company to worry about. What's it to you? Let's just say a little bird told me. It was easy. I hacked into their system and left a little subroutine. It's a recursive operation that submits our names with a callback frequency of every five seconds. Wow, color me impressed. It was nothing. Ass kissing aside, Peter, what do you want? We never hear from you unless you want something. Through my own means, I'll be in the game with you. Yeah, good luck with that. We'll need more than luck. I want to win. We can figure this game out in the process and produce a copy of it. How about we partner up? I have a plan that will guarantee we win the five million. We'll split it three ways equally. Think about it. Not bad, right? Well, five million split two ways is even better. Hm? Would you two rather work with me or against me? You might end up with nothing at all. He's got a point. Dinosaurs are gonna be hard enough. I'd rather not have to worry about this sneaky asshole stabbing us in the back. So? Can I count on your cooperation? Mm. Okay. We're in. But we gotta share the prize equally. Cool. You're on. - Hey. - Hey. Is he asleep yet? He just passed out waiting for your call. But we should let him sleep for now. When you tried calling earlier, I was working. Sorry. He's probably upset with me. Don't let it get to you. He'll understand. Mm. Hey, know what? Mm-hm? You know how much he likes to play the games made by Mental Abyss? Well, they're releasing a new one. I signed up as a volunteer tester. And you won't believe what happened. Me, they've selected me to take part. I really wanted to tell him today, but I was swamped. And I just got back. It's okay. I'll tell him in the morning. You know, he's gonna go crazy. I better get going. Tomorrow's another long day. Love you. Love you too. - Hi. - Hm? You were picked for the beta too? Mm-hm. Their games are great. I've played every single one. Wow, cool. Oh, what do you think that is? I'm gonna go check it out. Oh, I recognize this. - It's the... - Oh! - Sorry about that. - It's okay. Excuse me. Um, I'm... Whoa. Uh, hi, Peter. The name's Eric. I know you. Yeah? Well, I don't know you. - Sorry. - Beat it. My friend must be mixed up. What do you think? Our AR tech is pretty realistic, huh? Hello, players. Welcome. You made it. This game is like nothing you've ever experienced before. There are two things to remember. First, when you enter the game, there will be backpacks scattered throughout the starting field. Each one will carry a variety of equipment to aid you. The second is that there are no rules. Players still alive after four hours share the grand prize pot of five million. And if you're the last one standing, you take it all. Now get ready. Start-up can be a bit disorienting. Welcome to "Dinosaur World." Let the game begin. Run! Leave the bags. We'll come back. You won't last long if you stay here. They look so real. This game is tougher than I expected. You could've left me to die back there. Thank me later. We still got 12 hours in here. Stay back. Come on! There's a cave here! Run! Yeah, let's go, let's go! Get in here! Shh. One. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Yes. No, no. Don't, don't. I think we're good. Looks like it. Thanks. I know it's not real, but it sure feels real. Heart's beating like crazy. I've never been so scared before. We've been hounded nonstop since we got here. You smell something? Did you fart? Huh? It's you. Huh? You're covered in dinosaur spit. I suppose they meant it when they said it was real, huh? That? If this part feels real, then what would being eaten feel like? Whoa. We should head back now and see if there are any bags left. Lily, grab that one. With a little cover, this place should be safe for a while. If we're lucky, the T-rex scared away the other players and, hopefully, the smaller dinosaurs as well. If we're lucky? That's not exactly a reassuring sentiment. I can't guarantee anything. We know next to nothing about the game. That said, if it's like the others I've played, hiding won't work for long. Sooner or later, it's fight or flight. - What d'you think? - Huh? It's good. - Let's rest. - Oh, yeah. - Huh? - My name is Eason, by the way. Oh. Eric. Nice to meet you. I think we should team up if we want to win. I can really use that prize money. Yeah, sounds good. Hope we make it. Did you have a look in your bag yet? Not yet. Hm. I got a rope, looks like. Rope against dinosaurs? What good is this? Whoa! Got this knife too. Mm. Seriously, talk about ineffective. - Not against players. - Huh? Hey! Medicine. I may live through this after all. When I fell during the chase, I got scratched up. Hey, help me with this? It'll probably sting a bit. I'm tough. I survived a Tyrannosaurus rex. I can take anything... Really, tough guy? Don't be so loud, dude. Just a bit more. All right, calm down, dude. Nearly there. Almost done. The man survived at T-rex, defeated by salve. Let's get back inside. We need to keep a low profile for now. Think we're good here. Yeah. I hope there's something awesome in here. Hey, how about this? Hm? What do you think this is? Whoa. Cool, man. It's a smaller version of the game map. Hey, what are the dots for? I think the green dots show our current position. Red dots are likely the dinosaurs. There's no way we can lose with this. Not really. It doesn't display the other players. Antivenom? What's this for? Toxic dinosaur? Ha! This. This is what I'm talking about. Nice. That could be fun. We've got to go, quick. Okay. So here's my plan. We just stay here hidden. Yeah, sure beats running for our lives. - We'll win this for sure. - Shh. Someone's here. Amateurs. Hey! The hell?! Why'd she do that? - 'Cause she's mean. - What you did... It's a mess. Hey! Was this your master plan, to hide behind some sticks? Yeah, he was almost eaten in the first few minutes. What? Wasn't only me. Look, she's hurt, and no use to us. We should take her out. She hasn't done anything to us. She needs help. I get that, but it'd be one less person we need to worry about. If we don't work together, I don't think anybody's gonna win this game. I won't do it. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna help you. Hold on. She might just be faking it. No, I don't think so. Don't you dare. It's okay. Trust me. I'm going to need your medicine. - But we might need it. - Hurry. Okay. Before I begin, could you pull your shirt down? Ju... ju... just a little so I can see the wound. If you try to take advantage of me, you're dead. I won't, I promise. It feels so real. Trust me, I know. So how did someone so tough get hurt so bad? I was careless. It didn't take long for people to turn on each other. I'm Vivian. I'm Eric. His name's Eason. Okay. All done. Thank you. No problem. Hey, is this a dating app or a game? Whatever, dude. Hey! Better give that back. I'm sorry! Sorry. Okay. Watch out! Looks like a raptor. Where's she going? I knew it was a mistake to trust her. She just left us here. Oh. Oh, oh. Whoa! What are you guys doing? Don't just sit there! Run! I knew we could trust her. - Wait, hold on a sec. - What are you doing? Help! Help. Help me. Help! Over there. He needs help. Grab on! - Oh, sorry. - I'm sorry, man. What's happening? Wait, wait. We're friendly. - Don't worry, fellas. - We're friendly. This will be quick. Sorry. You guys are so dead. Whoa! Oh, yeah. Another player is dead. Let me see. Pterodactyl got him. That building is too big for there not to be something useful in it. Let's go. Hey, hey! - Open the door! - Open up! I open this door for you, and we all die! - Asshole. - Come on. Hey! Hey! Why didn't you let us in?! It's everyone for themselves, you know that! All right, let's go! This is way more stressful than I expected. We're trapped. Any idea how to get out of this one? - Hey. - Huh? What are you here for? I attend a local university. - Uh-huh. - Masters in paleontology. It was going pretty well, but a year ago, my mother became very ill. The medical bills are adding up. On top of the tuition, we just can't afford it. Might have to drop out and take care of her. I see. So this competition is your best shot. It is. The prize money could go a long way in paying for her procedures and giving me a chance to stay here. - And you? - Me? My life isn't what you'd call fulfilling. Wanted some fun. I'm a math teacher, and I hate math. - Math? - Yeah. That sounds awful. Right? I tried my best for my students, but it just wasn't enough. They still don't like me. This test is being streamed online, so let's win the prize to show them... that they have a cool teacher. Deal. Eason! No key. - What about the machine gun? - Help me out. Uh-huh. It's not moving. You guys know how to hot wire a car? Do I look like I know how to? This isn't a movie. Oh, yeah. That's right. The knife. I think that was a gunshot. Let's go. Come on, you son of a bitch! Someone has a gun, and I want it. They're not just gonna give it to you. I know that, idiot. Unlike you two, I have a plan. I asked you to join me because you're supposed to be the best, so less talk, more show. I think he's alone. Wait, he's still armed. Hey, I got this. Don't shoot! I'm unarmed. Slowly. - Are you alone? - Yes. I was with another player, but a raptor killed him, and I ran this way as fast as I could. Have you killed anything with that big gun? Yeah, I just got three raptors. It's so big. You're so strong. It's nothing. Woopsie! Hey, I think he was shocked to see me. Yeah. Tie him up. Let's go, big boy. Help! Help me! Hey! Come on. I can't trust you. Why? I could've walked away and let that raptor eat you. Hm? Okay, fine. Bye. Seriously? - Come on, guys! - Bye. You can't leave me here like this. - Hey! - Hm? Look, I don't even want the gun. You can have it. Just please let me go! Sorry, can't do that. Oh, by the way, I've seen bigger. Hm. Help! - Somebody help! - Wait. Did you hear something? - No. - Help! You heard it that time. Yeah, I did. - Hey, help me! - That way! Anyone! Hey, someone's coming. Hey. Hey, over here. Could you guys help me? Please. - What do you think? - I don't know. How did you manage to get yourself in this position? I was tricked by three assholes. They took my rifle. Would you guys just get me outta here so I can go kill them? He's pissed. Might come in useful. Yeah. All right. Just hold on. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Now we're playing. I like it. 10 players remaining. New equipment has been delivered to the starting area. Everyone will be headed that way. Well, then, let's go back. What the hell? Poison. Come on, that was so close. Wait, did you seriously catch that dart? - Wait right here. - Hm. Hey, hey, man, I'm sorry! Hold on! It's just a game, dude! Hey! Stop! Keep away. You crazy?! Why'd you shoot it at a kid for? What's your problem, man? You are, you spineless coward. Picking on those who are too weak to fight back. Seriously? How about a taste of your own medicine? Whoa. All right. Come on, man. You take away consequences, and people show their true colors. Where is he? I killed him. I had no choice. You saved my life. Yeah, of course. That's the second time I saved you. Let's not make it a habit, okay? - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Now do you trust me? Okay. Okay. Let's get the new supplies. Come on. Don't fall behind. That way. Give me it. How come no one has shown up yet? I don't like waiting. We don't know how many players are left. Don't worry, whoever's still alive will show up. Hey, why did you sign up for this anyway? Hm? Russell's a talented game designer. Most of my classmates love his games. We all wanted to be chosen to test "Dinosaur World." You don't know how envious my classmates are that I got picked. So I tried to stay hidden. I know I probably won't win the prize, but I didn't want to get killed too soon. I have a son about the same age as you. He really loves the games Russell makes too. What do you do in the real world? You don't look like a gamer. I'm a bodyguard for the rich and powerful. My job usually keeps me away from home. I don't get to see my son very much. My son was looking forward to this game, so I signed up to surprise him. I thought that if I won the competition, maybe I'd be a little bit closer to him. I didn't expect to be chosen. When the game is over, we'll have a lot to talk about. Hopefully, he'll be proud of me, you know? I would be proud if you were my dad. Let's team up. Come on. Where were you? I got lost. Huh. Huh? What's going on? Feels like an earthquake. Let's go. Whoa. See that? Man, they thought of everything. Quick. Shoot him. Wait. Something's chasing him. Oh, damn! Shh. One less to worry about. Can't be many more. We're not the only ones here. This doesn't feel right. There. They're camping the supplies, picking off those who come along. Hey, over there. This is too easy. Wow! Watch out! Eddie! Hang on. Still too dangerous. Just a bit longer. They ran after them. Now's a good time to get a bag. Wait. Okay, but let's be quick. Hurry! Eddie, hold on. We have to win, remember? Just leave me. Why did you do that? You could've got away. You saved my life twice. I still owe you one. You're a good kid. You're gonna be all right. Besides, if you still owe me one, you have to hang on for me, okay? Go. They'll be here any moment. This is painful. Hey. Hey! You're gonna wake up safe and sound. Kid, I'll make them pay for what they did to you. Weird. I think he was over here. Where's the other one? Poor kid. Better luck next time. It's our lucky day. - Look at this. - You found the key. Now the jeep is ours. Let's go. Someone's over there. They're here! Run! I don't think they're armed. It'll be hard to track down where they went, but they need to die. Lily and I will go after them. You check the supplies. Okay. I'll check the bags. Go. Huh? Time to pay for what you did. Help. Help! Jeremy. That guy with the kid we shot. What happened? Poison dart. Did you get him? - He got away. How's Jeremy? - It's poison. I threw away the antivenom. He also took the scope. Damn it! This guy's tough. We need to be cautious. What about the other two?! Gone. Great. Damn it! Hey. Shh. I'm not a threat. I know who's chasing you. They're chasing after me as well. We saw them shoot that boy. - Was he your friend? - Mm. So we should team up and kill those two and be done with it. Huh? Weren't there three? Managed to poison one. Got him! So what should we do now? It won't be long before the game's over, and it doesn't seem like there are many players left. Those two pose the only threat. They're professional gamers. As if that wasn't bad enough, they've got a sniper rifle. As things are, we can't compete against that. The grand prize means nothing. I don't even want it. But I want to make sure they don't get their hands on it either. I promised Eddie that I will avenge him. Mm-hm. So let's assess our situation, come up with a plan. Do you have anything in your bag we can use? Oh. I have two hand grenades. You should take one. Mm. Hey, I got the scope. I don't need it anymore. Take it. Move! Move! Hey. Go! Take it. Something found them. Maybe the dinos will kill them for us. We have to make sure. They didn't last this long with only luck. All right, let's go. - Mm-hm. - Clock's ticking. Not bad, you two. Alex, there's one more over there! Go! This way! Grenade! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. This guy doesn't give up. Even with a bullet in him, he nearly took us out. Are you sure you can kill him? Yeah. With those wounds, he won't be alive much longer. We made a good team. You have to go. Just leave me. But we haven't helped you avenge Eddie. The longer you stay here, the more dangerous it becomes. Live and fight on. Run. I swear, we're not gonna let them win this game. Survive till the end, and get rid of those two bastards. Now get going. Let's go. Don't move! He's still alive. I'm sure I got him. You're a lousy shot! Your aim was off! Then prove it! Seriously?! Didn't you see your friend?! You want to end up like him? You two won't stand a chance against me. Listen, how about you step out and we can talk through a solution to this? Is he dead? One of the best players I've ever seen. What about the other two? We still need to take them out. There's not much time. Let's go. - Get the jeep. - Okay. We can't stay here. It's too dangerous. - Man the gun. - Yeah. Woo! Let's get those two. - Yeah! - Yeah! Woo! Hey, Eric! How's it going down there? Are you kidding, dude? You're actually still alive? Yeah. Pterodactyl dropped me in her nest and flew away. I found some Easter eggs. - Easter eggs? - Yup. Come here. Let me show you. See? There. I can talk to dinosaurs. Get outta here. Huh? Hey, do you hear that? Sounds like an engine. Over there. It's them. They've got themselves a jeep. Huh. Of course they did. And it's got a machine gun. Then we're as good as dead. What do we do? We can't take them on. - Triceratopses. - Huh? Where? They're like scale-covered battering rams. If only we can use 'em somehow. I got this. Where are you going? What are you waiting for?! Shoot! Yeah! Huh? Yeah! You gotta be kidding me! Just keep shooting! Huh? No more ammo! A man and a woman in a black jeep heading that way. All right. Gonna talk to the pterodactyl and T-rex now. Thanks, guys. Okay, they're gonna help us out. You sure they got the message? You doubt me? Come on! Why are they chasing us? It's those two. I'm sure of it. It's the volcano. We should get to higher ground. Yeah. The game's nearly over. Almost there. Yeah. - Hey! - It's over! - Wait. - Come any closer, and he's dead! I win! Hey, easy. Easy. - It's okay. - Don't you move! It's okay. It's okay. - Not a muscle! - Wait, wait, wait. - Stay back... - Forget about me. ...or I'll kill you too! I swear it! But I know how you can get what you really want. - It's not worth it. - I know, it's not about the money. You want to copy the code. We found an Easter egg. It's yours. - What? - If you let him go. Don't do it. Take me. I'll show you. Good game. - Huh? - Hey, man, Easter egg's right here. It's a gift from Alex. Congratulations. You win. Eric, thank you. Congratulations to Eason for being the last man standing, and thanks to all the chosen volunteers for their exemplary participation. Thanks. 35 million viewers watched your performances and voted on which player would receive an additional five million. They voted for the person who most embodied the virtues of selflessness and good sportsmanship, which was the true objective of this competition. And the vote went to Eric! Good job. Congrats, man. We always believed that games were about more than points and leaderboards. You showed that the determination to stick to your principles is more important than winning. Dinner's on me tonight! - Hey! Congratulations. - Good game, dude. - Hey. - Good game. Jeremy, Lily, in response to hacking our systems to secure entry into the competition, you are hereby banned from all Mental Abyss games. What?! - This is all your fault. - My fault?! It was your idea to hack the system in the first place! Peter is also banned from our games for hacking the system. Plus, his in-game conduct was witnessed by all his customers and clients. - Congrats. - Good game. Come on. - Mm. - See you later. Hey, I was thinking we'd share the prize money, but I guess there's no need now. I mean, I won't say no to more money. Oh, greedy! In your dreams. Let's go!
