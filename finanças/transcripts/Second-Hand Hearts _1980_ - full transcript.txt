Well, I have did just about everything there is to do. I'm probably the most qualified person ever come into these parts. Down there in, in Corpus, for a while I worked in a chicken factory.

That's the main thing we gotta be thankful for. (Dinette) 'He's not mournin' like us.' 'Tears and all.' 'I think he's being ignored to death' 'like an Indian on a reservation.' 'Oh, my God!' 'Everything is so tragic' 'in New Lizard.' 'Nell, Nell, Nell.' Oh, my heart just broke. 'Oh, Ermy!' 'Why didn't she say goodbye. Ermy?' Uh, she's got a plane to catch, and I gotta help her catch it. That's no reason. Children, you say goodbye to Aunt Ermy. Smile and be polite. 'Ermy? What's she doin'?' It ain't the kids' fault, you know? She-she's just a little nervous. Well, these kids is Nell's blood. That's why. Look, we brought those kids in because we wanted to 'and they all would say the same.' (Dinette) 'I know that. But, it's apt they was here'' 'There's half my blood and half Jim Bob's blood.' 'And so, therefore, they belong here.' 'If that Ermy's gonna be saying that-that, well, Nell was took' because of these kids, passin' judgment on me makin' me feel like I'm sin all over and now my kids my innocent kids. Well? Well, what do you say to that? We ain't to blame. The blessin' is that she went before this sorry day. The main thing is.. It's not the kids' fault. - Ha-happy. - Happy. - Oh, kids, they do not. - Happy. [engine revving] Human, impolite to stare. 'Loyal.' - Yeah? - 'It's over.' - What? - 'They're lowerin' her.'

She wouldn't want me to wallow. She wouldn't wallow and she wouldn't want me to. (Loyal) 'You're absolutely right, Uncle Voyd.' I'm a good friend of yours. I should've thought of that for you my own self. What you need to do is just get away and do some killin' for a while. Mummy. She'd say, "Voyd, if it becomes "my unpleasant duty to see to you "I will see to you as simply as possible and catch the next plane to Miami Beach, Florida." That's beautiful. - Isn't that beautiful, darlin'? - Mm-hmm. What's he gonna do with business for her? Oh, hell, you don't have to worry about that. We-we've about got it down now. He can break me in in no time. Is that what you sayin', Voyd? That Loyal and me's goin' to take over the place 'when you're gone?' Well, I'm selling the place, Dinette. The place is up for sale. Sale? That's the first thing I'd done was stop by Miss Nighty's comin' back from the airport. Oh. For sale? (Voyd) 'I'm done with the place, Loyal. I'm going huntin'.' Oh. Uh.. Whoa, whoa, Voyd. I know it's your hour in need but you gotta think clear now. 'You just gotta.. In, uh..' 'Think about the brood.' 'Jim Bob's brood.' (Voyd) 'Well, they's your brood now, Loyal, I'd say.' (Loyal) 'My brood?' My brood? - I'd say. - My-my brood? You're hungry, honey? My, mine? (Voyd) 'She'd say to me' "Voyd, you'd be "gettin' deer season. I can see that far away look in your eye." (Loyal) 'Is this thing loaded?' (Dinette) 'Loyal, what you doin'?' What you're going to do? (Loyal) 'I'm gonna..' Huh? You behave yourself, kids, now. Stay here. Loyal! Sweetie. [door shuts] And I'd say "You better clean out that freezer, Nell. 'Cause I'm bringin' home some deer." [birds chirping] Loyal? Sugar? 'Now, why is it, I wonder' 'you don't call your mother up.' Oh, Loy. If I had somebody.. ...I'd call them up. Sure. 'I don't have anyone, Lo.' You're my only soul. You and the kids. My, my, my. You know how I've been treated by the Dustys? Voyd comes to me after three pregnancies. Huh, he says, "Well, me and Nell. "We prayed and thought that you, Dinette would at last straighten our Jimb Bob out." God. How was I supposed to know? I don't know why I'm cryin'. Oh, God. Twelve years with a man. Comin' at me with toy handcuffs. [bell ringing] And make believe.. You wanna know what? [train horn honking] You open the car door. Yelled "Geronimo" and jumped. You mean, when he.. Oh. Leaving me and the kids to our own devices Eighty miles an hour. I don't know why I'm cryin'. Because you're good. That's why. I just can't, Dinette. I just can't take you to California, that's all. [Loyal sniffling] Do what you can, Loyal. We do what we can. Yes, Loyal. [crickets chirping] [telephone ringing] (Loyal) 'Later, ah, somebody to travel with.' Okay, sure. We're entirely done, honey. - 'What's this all about?' - Where is Human? Human? Human. Somebody homesick before even went? Get in the car now, hear? - Have 'em with you. - Oh, Voyd. You are.. Thank God, bless you. - Look what Voyd gave us. - What did he give? - Ten dollars. - Oh, that's wonderful! Wonderful! Come here, Voyd. (Loyal) 'I think, we're just leavin' you in the lurch.' 'We should be living with you.' One thing about California is that they got the welfare. Oh, you mean, uh "Look on the bright side. Ding, ding, ding." Huh? (Dinette) 'For you, you just bend over backwards for all of us.' 'Too far and, and you just, and just..' I don't know, we loved every minute of it, because of you. (Voyd) 'Well, when you get in the movies' 'you let us know, you hear?' (Loyal) 'The movies?' 'Now you're talking about the movies.' (Dinette) 'Yeah, alright, kids, now..' 'You be nice or you'd be left behind.' 'And now, Human, you sit near-near the window.' 'And Sandy Dee should come up with me. Okay?' - There she goes. - 'Sandy Dee in the front.' (Loyal) 'Huh?' No reprise, I guess, huh? All you can get hangin' around here is flies. So, drive careful, you guys. (Dinette) 'Now, Voyd, you've always got place with us.' 'Do you know that? You do, don't you?' 'You're always welcome.' 'And-and, and, Loyal, your mother have a couch?' It's just sink or swim from here on in. And all the catastrophe's over. All, all the tragedy. Everything is good up front of us. Okay, okay we're safe and sound 'and secure, and, and, and..' 'Say goodbye to grandpa, kids.' 'Say bye-bye, because he's bein' left behind.' [instrumental music] Ain't you listenin'? Yeah, you-you, you played in the church. You know, this is the bluebird, right? And the bluebird flew away on stage like this. A-a-and Tittle said, "Oh. '"Oh, the bluebird.' '"A storm on the way.' It has gone and forever." See, look here. What the hell am I supposed to make out of that? (Dinette) 'So, we'll just pretend it's gone.' And the bluebird, you know for all intents and purposes went away. And then I-I set the whole auditorium. 'Oh, the bluebird' 'a happiness' it's flown away. Because you should never put happiness in a cage. I don't understand. According to that damn sign we are heading for Florida. But once it is gone.. Listen to this, honeys. Once it is gone you can always find the bluebird again because love.. ...is the key that opens every door and happiness. Happiness comes from the heart. 'So, it always comes back.'

'She's had him this long.' (female #2) 'Don't you worry, he'll run out on her.' It's just a question of time. Hi, everybody decided? [guitar music] [crickets chirping] (Iota) 'Mommy.' Loyal. Someone will come along. Nobody's comin' along, Dinette, I told you. There ain't nobody gonna come along. Typical Thomas. Always doubtin', aren't you? You all the time pushin' me this way and pushin me that way. Loyal, not here. I didn't stop you from gettin' gas, did I? You're leapin' on me now. Oh, but, I wasn't even in charge of gas. Make me in charge of gas and see if we run out-- No, but you've been breathin' down my neck that's what you've been doing. Um-umm. You said you was in a hurry. I was helpin'. And all the time actin' like if I'm out of sight for two seconds I'm, I'm gonna run off somewhere and desert you. Where on Earth? Where on Earth did I get that idea, I wonder? Well, you just better not because I just damn near might! Loyal, I'm well aware of the idea that you're plannin' on dumpin' us the first chance you get, I'm well aware. Talkin' about dumpin' I gotta go see a man about a dog. - 'Where's the toilet paper?' - Used up. (Loyal) 'Where in the hell is the toilet paper?' - Used up! - 'Used up?' Use the comic book, they finished it. I got to use the comic book 'cause it's used up on account of we're out because you and the kids blow your nose on instead of usin' it for the purpose it's supposed to be used for! Loyal! Damn you. Loyal! What the hell we're gonna do? (Loyal) 'Nothin' important except for me to hike on down the road' 'to a Loco Junction.' (Dinette) Oh, sir. And leave us here, uh-uh. Uh-uh, no, sir. (Loyal) 'Well, we can't all five of us go marchin' off' 'into the goddam pitch black now, can we?' You know what? I have an instinct someone's gonna come along. (Loyal) 'Yeah, if we wait long enough' 'maybe, the bluebird will come along.' [dogs howling] (Dinette) 'Loyal?' Yes, ma'am? Have you ever been in love? We're out of gas and what does she get? Romantic. I mean, other than Lady Claroil. Well.. ...there was for a while up in Ogden, this.. The waitress. She used to put whipped cream on the pie pretty regularly without chargin' me extra. I do think about her quite a bit. Quite a bit? That's serious. Very. I don't get too close too often. This means.. ...that you discriminate. - Is that what that means? - Mm-hmm. Of course. Well, you select. You know like pickin' and choosin' the good one. - Oh. - Hmm. Well.. ...hell, you know you.. ...take somebody out nowadays and.. ...it's gonna cost you.. ...fifteen, 20 bucks.. ...without drinks usually. And look what happened when you did that. [instrumental music] What's the matter? Nothing. Well, I thought, uh, you know I was talking too loud and-and the kids are sleeping. Are you still sore at me? Because of the way.. ...because of...the fact that we tied the knot and all. - Oh, no. - Ever? - No.. - No? You can't win 'em all. You gotta lose some of 'em. It's wonderful. I...you have to learn to take the bitter with the better. That's my philosophy. Do you know that you have.. ...every right to.. ...be hot with me on the subject of marriage. - No. - Yes. - I'm not hot, Dinette. - Well, why not? But there's that and then.. Also secondly.. ...as a man you are entitled to privileges.. ...and.. I am entitled, I mean.. ...it's the law. I know that. Well.. It is the law. - Will it stop, honey? - I don't know. I damn sure would. I'll give her a check. Forget it. Why? Where's your mustard.. - It's a diesel. - What's wrong with a diesel? They can't stop. It's against the rules for them. [horn blaring] [indistinct chatter] - It stopped.. - The hell it did. It did! - Goddamn! - What did I tell ya? What did I tell ya? Stay here. Lock the doors and roll up the windows. And I'll be back in about an hour. - We're comin' with you now. - No! You can't, Dinette. Loyal, you gonna go down that road. I know you. You're gonna quit us. Loyal! Loyal! No! No! There ain't room for five of us. Oh, lord. Pity sakes. Lord have mercy on me. He ain't gonna wait. I'll be back! I'll be back! [thunder rumbling] Loyal! [screaming] Oh, I don't care. Loyal! You can just let me off any place in loco junction. You won't find any gas until Prague. 'I'm gonna have to let you out five miles inside too.' It's as close as I can get in this rig. The truck route turn off or I'll get a ticket trying to go through town. Five miles outside of town is where I started. Hell, if...if I ain't gonna get no place.. Goddamn. [instrumental music] [engine revving] I give muchacha dinero. Por take me fgasolina in the towna. Oh, yes [speaking in foreign language] - What'd she say? - She said to call my brother. Call your brother? He and his friends will take you. - Well, why can't you take me? - She say no. Well, uh, I don't wanna make any trouble-- [speaking in foreign language] Loco junction...I think I be-better go. - 'Mister?' - Huh? You wait a minute. They come pick you up later. 'Don't be scared.' No! I'm not scared. There's nothing to be scared of. I just, uh. I'm just in a hurry. [Dinette singing] (Iota) 'Isn't Loyal Muke our daddy anymore?' You know how to cut to the bone, don't ya? (Iota) 'Is he, or isn't he?' I ain't no mind-reader. Go to sleep, Iota. I wouldn't say it's very likely. [humming] (Iota) 'Don't sing anymore. It's scary.' Ol' Loyal can handle it. Been on the road too long. Yet here now.. Listen. I, uh, I didn't mean to.. Oh, sorry man. I just.. Bullshit! Oh, please, Mr. Beaner, go away. 'I'm sorry for everything' [engine revving] Damn! [train hooting] Oh. Oh, keep going legs. Almost there. Hang on, Dinette. I'm coming. Oh, boy. Oh! Whoa! Oh, thank God! I'm saved. Oh! (male #4) 'Can't hear a word you're sayin'' 'you might as well save your breath.' Insisted on me buyin' one of these things and it hasn't worked since the day I got it. - 'I'll be..' - You can't hear? Why there was nothin' wrong with my hearing since she started here. Is there another all-night gas station that's open all night? Before I come up there and beat the living hell out of the both of us. - Yes, sir. - I understand. - I can do that. - Oh, oh. What can I do for you? Yes, sir. Shall I fill her up? Hey! Where's your car? - What's your phone number, sir? - Where? What's your phone number? - Where did you come from? - I got.. [Dinette singing] [car door opens] Done nothin' but just turn me so deep. Listen here. Are you there? I can't hear a damn thing with this damn thing. - Is she there? - Oh, uh.. Is she there? - 'Uh, the phone's ringing.' - Is she there? - I said the phone is ringing. - Is she there? The telephone is ringing. ...there's nothin' wrong with my hearing. Except I'm just sick and tired of listenin' to her. That's all. (Loyal) 'Uh, hello?' Uh, uh, your husband's batteries are dead. And my wife is out in loco junction out of gas. And I was supposed to be gone for an hour or so. You sure this here is it? I'll let you know in a minute. Just hang on for a sec. This is it! I've got it! You sure? Yes, sir. I can prove it if I have to. Well, what do you want to do? Call the highway patrol or what? Oh. (Loyal) 'Uh, kinda of rough country out here, ain't it?' (male #5) 'Yeah, you got nothing but ordinary well-pushers' 'stirred-up Mexicans and Indians with their hands out' 'the way I see it.' 'Say..' 'Are you a drinkin' man?' (Loyal) 'Oh, uh, well, see.

I'm afraid that won't stand up. - Stand up? - 'In a court of law, sir.' You're lucky I don't throw up in your lousy court of law. I left the coffee on, how about it? (Dinette) Mm-hmm. I ain't talking about these gals who have kids and go out all the time. They goin' to the dogs. They goin' to extremes. What I'm talkin' about is where did you come in? Oh, well, I just wanna get to California and-and that's all I wanted. And if I get to California, I will be fine, I'm sure. That's what my folks thought too. Now you'll sit down, huh? Thank you.

We heard that one. The way I heard, it was these two nuns.. No! It was Rastus and Lizzy. Really happened. The way I heard it, it was Indians. I was telling you...about my people. Yes, ma'am. They thought the answer to all was California too. Same old story, huh? Well...it got this far. And the transmission blew. And all they had.. [coughs] All they had was nine cents, little lard and me. So, what do you figure they did? [coughs] 'Made perfect sense at the time.' They were childless here and the Dodge was overpopulated. You mean they left you. And never come back. Isn't that awful?

(Loyal) 'Well, I'm catching up with you for one thing.' You're catching up on me? 'Oh, fine. I'm catching up with you is more like it.' Miss Innocent, huh? I might have guessed. A car thief in my own family. A car thief? 'You're a wife deserter, that's what you are.' I was in jail is what I was. And running all night on the highway. 'And them beaters out there have been running me ragged.' Does that sound like deserters to you, ma'am? It sounds like the tallest story I ever heard is what it sounds like. This is life and death is what it is. What you've got to do is you gotta go out there and, and start that car because we got to make a beeline for the highway and hit the road.

[Loyal screams] - You flooded it! - I didn't, Loyal. - You flooded the car. - No. There was nothing wrong with this car until you got in.. [screaming] They're here! Get away! Roll up the windows! Roll up! Dinette! Dinette.. [car engine revving] [instrumental music] [whimpering] Oh.. - Here they come! - Here they come! - Here they come! - I hear you, goddammit! - I know they're coming. - No. Well, with that language, I'm just getting hurt. So quit with that language. Well, you can just open the door yell "Geronimo!" and jump if you don't like it. I can't help on account. You can't get along with people. "Wife leaps from speeding car. Foul language to blame." - Ha-ha-ha. - 'He's gaining on us.' He's gaining on us. (Loyal) I could've been halfway to Canada by now. But no! (Iota) They're gaining on us! (Loyal) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Now can't you go any faster than this. Can't you? Come on, you log, try! (Iota) 'They're gaining on us.' I'm gonna get it, Dinette. Oh, you don't know that. - Try, hear me? - Try? Yikes, you never hear the word before? Try! (Loyal) Well, she-she's.. [indistinct chatter] (Dinette) Say it, "Try." Alright, sugar. Okay? Try, Loyal. Say it. "Try." - Try, Loyal! - Tryin'! - Try! - Try! Try. (Dinette) Alright, sugar, try.' Sugar, put your foot on that pedal and don't let it off until I say stop. - Try! - That's it, Loyal. Tr-tr-try! - Try. - Try! For the sake of your wife and children.. Try! - Try! - Try! (Loyal) Try! (Dinette) 'Try.' (Loyal) 'Try!' We're, we're, we're going 80. Yoo-ho-ho-ho! If you don't get it up to 90, you're gonna hear from me. I-I-I ain't never been over 65 in my whole life! Whoa! Try! (Loyal) Hey, Dinette, look in the mirror. (Dinette) I know. I'll say. They've given up. They have given up! You know what, Dinette? This is the first scrap I've ever been in my whole life that I won! Well, that's 'cause you never met me to tell you how fast you really is in real life. - In reality, you-- - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I never had so much fun in my whole life! I can't remember when I had so much fun. When did I have any fun? [laughing] You beat 'em, Loyal. We beat 'em, Iota. [instrumental music] [sheep bleating] [Sandra laughing] [Sandra babbling] It's an American eagle, almost extinct. Named Igor. - 'Igor?' - Hmm. Poor thing. Guess I always liked old Igor. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Go on, get in the car. - Loyal Muke? - Huh? - What you got? - Never mind. 'Cause if I tell you, then we'll both know. You get it? [Sandra laughing] (Dinette) What's that? - That big? - Yeah! Now.. ...they didn't have no bluebirds so I did the best I could. Ahh! Mr. Bluebird of happiness. It's a, a hamster.. ...of-of happiness for all of us. - Oh. - You can hold him. [babbling] - Easy, now. - Iota. [Sandra laughing] Thank you, darling. [murmuring] For them. Put-put-put, put it up here. Ah. [car engine cranking] No, no, no. No. [car engine revving] (Iota) 'Good you didn't get two of them 'cause they eat each other up.' That makes us very lucky, don't it? (Loyal) 'Anyway, this song is all about Harry Buddy always asked him..' '...where he was from.' Or maybe never asked him but, see, that's what was on his mind. What it was like to.. ...live on an island when you're little. Sugar, if you write that song, I will sing. Meanwhile, he's not living on an island anymore. That's was hard. 'See, it's kinda hard to explain.' Like in the city you gotta walk fast and count your change. I was born on an island. I was the only baby born on Santa Catalina island the whole month I was born, maybe even the whole year. That always seemed like somethin' to me. The mysterious world I knew. That's what you think. [chuckling] [humming] Are you blushing? (Loyal) 'How about it, Human? Want some swim fins?' 'One, anyway. Ha-ha!' You see that picture? I knew that girl when she posed for that picture. 'And believe me, that don't show the half of it.' Maybe you need some help in there. I could help you look for them patches. (Loyal) 'There better be a pump here, too.' Or we're doomed. Hey, wait a minute! Here, I got something for the whole family. See, I used to sell these up in Beloit, Iowa. Them's encyclopedias. Oh, my.. A, B. A, B and A, B. Good for a start, ain't it? See, it was a introductory offer. Just A through B, but that's something. (Loyal) I'd come up with this invention in Anchorage, Alaska. Can't roll no tire with your hands freezin'. See, you, you've got use the old mind if you're gonna make it on the road. 'Cause America's different. Any place you're at. Oh, it's the same too. But, it-it-it's different too. Now, you take car washes for example. You kids, listen to uncle daddy. He's got expert advice. Well, some places in America, they are you do-it-yourself car wash. In other places, they are you pay somebody else to do it for you. Now, in some places, say, like, Pocatello they think it's wrong not to wash your own car on Saturday afternoon. Sissy or something. Here, hold that thing. - Man on the road. - Oh, bless the Lord! And you'll learn facts like this if you're real interested in what's going on around you and what makes one place, one place and another, another. Used to be you could always step in to wash dishes if you was hungry or needed a job but not anymore. Nowadays, everything's electricity. What's got me worried is when it comes your time, Human.. ...there ain't gonna be no way a bum can make it anymore. There won't be no place to go that's away. And all them places I told you about that were different.. ...they'll all be the same. Hmm. Look, like the man says we gotta be philosophical. (Loyal) 'That's progress.' [instrumental music] [music continues] I can sure in hell see where they get that purple mountains majesty from. Don't you? What's that, sugar? Do you know what the thing about a sunset is? That it's beautiful. Oh, yeah, honey, it's beautiful. But see, the thing about a sunset is the worse the weather the better the glow. And I think so in my heart just paint a picture of this whole thing. Yeah, you know another thing about a sunset? What? The longer you wait the more beautifuller it gets. And I think the more beautifuller it gets the longer it takes. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. You have some tongue on you, Loyal. And when you put your mind to it...it's silver. Goddamn, it's, it's breathtaking. You're one hell of a man, Loyal, you really are. I love you too, Dinette. Oh.. I love you. (Dinette) I can't even believe it. 'I got so damn lucky.'
