I will always remember the I first saw the Redwoods. That was the day that my life began. Someone is ready to... go! Good morning. Go get dressed Billy. Your grandparents will wonder: "Who is this handsome guy? ? You are so grown!? ? You can not be Billy... or can? "O my God, really?! ? It's Billy!? We need shaving cream? In the closet store room next to the toothpaste. And you know what? There will be enormous, really huge ship in Seattle. What do you think of this? Billy goes to brush his teeth, dear. You can deal with the mold shower while we away? And the brown rust stains on the ceiling. I'll get disinfectant. I found them such vouchers, but are for packages of 26 gallons, not 13. - The 26 are too large. - I know. Everett... not so easy to get your nails in the carpet. - Billy? - So... I want to buy 13 gallons without the coupon? Billy wanted to brush his teeth? Sorry, you say? Nothing. Billy? Its alright all is well. I just have great job this week. I'll wait for you here... when you get back. I promise. We have to go, Billy. - Do not forget to arrange to have sprinklers. - Okay. I'll call you when I get there. Drive with care. Goodbye. Come with me and Anna tonight. Shane No offense, but... Watch straight guys get drunk is not my definition of fun. Sometimes we have to make trouble. You are really good at it. You know, you're as bad as him. Actually... I am desirous of spend some time alone. Do not you think... have been alone long enough? Hello .. I'm lost. Where to? For Humboldt Bed & Breakfast? It is in the Humboldt Street, right? This is the Alameda de Humboldt. Not so far. All you have to do is back on this road... Can you show me the map? I am a bit bewildered. Sure. Very good. - Sorry to be boring. - Nothing. The owner of the place is a good friend of my mother. - Bad with directions. - She was probably drugged. - Really? - Do not tell her I said that. Word of scout! Here's where we are... - Sorry... - No, it's a. .. So you have to return to this road here... and when it's Mayfield... Mayfield will drive you exactly... the city. Yes. It does not seem very complicated. When in doubt avoid gravel roads. Good advice. - By the way, my name is Chase... - Everett... Thank you for being so helpful. I did not do much. Where is it? Guess... I'm here to finish a novel. I hope. He is a writer. I aspire to be. It also aspired... - In times. - Really? It's a long... and very boring story. I better get back to work. Yes, yes, I better find my way into town. Goodbye Everett. Goodbye. This piece was perfectly in the spare bedroom, but... your dad would kill me for sure if I took something home. It is I who should protest with all the contraptions of golf. Are you okay? Yes. - What? - Nothing... work is crazy at this point. - It is not even tax season. - It's always time for taxes. O my God, are 10 hours. Gotta go. I leave you at home? I. .. I'll stay here a little longer. You'll stay here? Do what you want. Raisins there then? This is a small town. Do not expect to find you here. I love antique shops. You should meet my mother. For your information, dodgy... I left the store before him. I mean, Wilson, is not it strange he has not gone to Seattle with Miles? Walk not looking for trouble, Tess. I do not walk looking for trouble! All these old pieces have stories behind, you know? Imagine the secrets it contained. You speak as a writer. You never told me what you were doing. It's so... boring you probably forgot. I am accountant. It seems... challenging. Yes .. allows me to stay home with Billy. You have a son? And a partner. They are... out. - How long have you been together? - 8 years. No. .. seven. Yes .. Seven years. I have... What are your plans for today? Everett, what a surprise! - Behave Didi. - Never. You have become fast friends. The Everett agreed graciously being my tour guide. For today. Lucky. I know I have to my camera here somewhere. I. .. I wait outside if you want. What? No, come in! I'll just take a minute. What about this? Ring if you want... I do not know how. Just... blows. What are you writing? Good question. It makes you feel so... insignificant. Some of these trees have been here since... the time of Christ. How many things endure the test of time like this? Not many, I suppose. It may take us a picture? Sure, no problem. Just press the button. - See? - Yes. - Try to catch as much of the tree as you can. - I'm not very photogenic. I doubt it very much. Ready? - Nice... already. - Wait! You can take one more? Sure. No problem. Perfect. Peter Pan represented here, in the sixth year. It seems to have been the perfect casting. I want to read your book. Are you serious? I had courses in writing creative while I was at Stanford. They accepted you Stanford? Very funny. Still needs much work. So?! You got to lose? ? I was born in Faith, North Dakota. [? \u003d Fe] Population: 800. The nearest doctor was 218 km. In Grand Forks. To my family, Faith was not enough. But for me, Faith only offered isolation. One of my earliest memories is a bitter winter morning at the ranch. Was six. And as he shook and looked to the plain, a sudden awareness struck me like a stone. I do not belong here. I've never belonged. Was lost. Lost in Faith. (Lost in Faith) Now all these years Faith then left behind. My accent has disappeared, my few friends there are gone, however, I'm still one kid lost in the dark fields, trying to find my way. There are no professional in this? We have some lakes in Minnesota. I never imagined in a million years, which would end up staying here. Do not you tell me what you think of the book. You even ran away from home? Gives a good story. You have a style writing clear and succinct. And I worried with the character principal, not only for being naturally curious but get me really relate to it. My parents were academics e. .. and almost all were kids at school *. I was the wet dream of bullies. - You have a gift for words. - No. Yes, you. Not really. - You can not accept a compliment? - Okay! Thanks! You can steal them for your book. - I will. - The title has to change. I like the title. It's a bit... It's a bit extravagant. Extravagant? Faith is a real place, is a play on words. I realized. But it sounds religious. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just... You never you enter it. Are you being too literalist. Well, as you gird just the facts and characters... your story is really exciting. When you stray from the subject, or play with words as you like to say I have a tendency to become a little sentimental. O my God! We do not we become sentimental? It was already expecting that. What is wrong with you when you talk about writing? You become so aggressive! Taste. Didi... you are hiding something. And not only marked cards. He came only to visit a friend Minnesota which is housed here. One thing turns, however... if I had less than ten years... Do you mean twenty...! Look who's talking. So this... friend, have a name? His name is Chase, okay? Chase? Gin! Very nice. 'Quarrel. You have good taste. I did not do anything about it. Just waved... immense. It seems he knows what he does. They are... stable. Leal... good with Billy... I love my partner. Amo. I just... You know something sprinklers? I think it is repaired. - It's almost ready to open water. - What? Should I turn it off? Are you okay? You're right. Not... a problem of water pressure. Just for future information... "Almost ready" not means "fully ready" since the objective is watering the grass and not my face. I am so sorry. Even... I feel really bad. Seriously. - You did it on purpose. - No! I swear. I wish I could be so smart. Are you? Stop! Stop! These things are great, to diet. First you tell me that write in the wrong direction, then you tell me you do not have a phone and now this? What they taught you in Minnesota? Not much, apparently. Thank God for small miracles. ? Hello .. ? Well .. ? You showed him some ships? ? Great... ? Yes, let me use the coupons. ? Right... ? Yes .. ? Is he there? ? Hands him the phone. ? Hello? ? Can you hear me? Hello Hello Can I help you? I'm searching for Didi. She left. Buy some supplies. It's true! She talked about it. Gave me the idea. It should not take. Want to sit? I do not want to bother him. Not to bother. Sit. In this case... thanks. You're welcome. Beautiful day, huh? Do you by any chance... will not be the Chase? ... Then had rivers I sweat to run down his face, right? Standing there like a deer blinded, this is just the largest stadium in the state, ok? There were hundreds of people in the stands, could well have been millions... There was a TV crew... - It seems important thing... - Yes, yes... I do not know who was more nervous, me or that damn calf. Trust me, it was the calf. - I go the calf roast. Me too. Then later, after... I chase, chase, chase... and BOOM! Tie it, right? And somehow... I do not know how... tie gets stuck in my foot, and was dragged 50 meters into the arena. Appeared on the news of 11 hours. Are you invent... It looks terrifying. Totally humiliating more concretely. Can not wait to read your book. Do not have many expectations. He did not connect... He is very talented. Thank you. It's the truth. So Chase has a girlfriend? Or should I say, a boyfriend? Mother, let alone type. Someone wants more beans? I want to. Fine. Why not ask me first? - Well, you never introduce me to your friends. - Note the indirect! You know that the mother does not want you do this when there are visitors. Yes, yes, yes. So? What do you think? I think... this is the perfect temperature. About Chase! Who? You mean your new boyfriend? Dodgy! It feels good. Not what you think. Never is. The Everett used write their pieces, you know? put all the neighborhood kids in the cast, rehearsing in the back. I saw his masterpiece, "The Massacre of the Twisted Humboldt" Three times. He paid to have seen. I am surprised by he'll never have mentioned. Thank you. - Hello - Hello I understand that all this has been embarrassing for you, They love you. Listen... if it is easier for you, I keep my distance... Chase? Duty calls. Chase? I have plans for tomorrow... be with you. I'm looking for Humboldt man more attractive. You must be lost. No. .. I'm in the right place. You really ought to think about having lessons harmonica. Shut up! I'm making you a serenade. This is... even scary. What? Not kidding me, but... Since childhood I wanted visit the region of the redwoods. I do not know why, just... something told me. Ever had such places? You always wanted... visit? Barcelona. Buenos Aires. - Bakers Field... - Stop to enjoy. - Stop! - Someone has tickled. Stop! Tell me how you do. Do what? What thou wilt. It seems to me that no cues concerns interfere, not that there's anything wrong with that, I admire him. What stops you then? I need to eat. Guaranteed. If it makes you feel better, this routine as a writer dying of hunger, not exactly... Worry-free, you know? Odd jobs, odd hours. I have to constantly remind myself that... continuing to do what I like, everything will be solved. Most people when you know it is uncomfortable, or worse, have pity on me. My God, Everett, give me more credibility than that. So I do not know until point have dealt with children... Tell me more about Billy. He likes boats. Never would have guessed. I used to stutter all day. Could count up to 10 in Spanish, thanks to the servant. And one day it stopped. Hey, baby... What is the name of a fish Golden beginning with 'P'? Six letters. Palmer? Right. You know, Chase seems to me a good boy. Let's not there, okay? I was not going anywhere. Well, whatever. Good night. Father? Yes? What are we doing here? We're here because this is the last place your mother would look for me. The mother is well? Yes, yes. Chase still out there? Yes. Is busy writing. The wounds can lead long time to heal, son. I'm in trouble, Shane. You two already...? No. Mano rays, have self-control. Not only have responsibilities. You know, there is a line... I can not overcome. Listens Everett, Love it? Good morning. Good morning. You do not know that you are attractive, do you? I think not. It's good. Wanted this weeks last forever. And it can. ? Now all these years later, ? Faith left behind, ? my accent has disappeared, ? my few friends there are gone, ? However, I continue to be that boy lost in the dark field, ? trying to find my way. What's happening? Nothing. Continues. The image of the lost boy is beautiful. But... I do not understand the meaning. The significance? Only some of we still lost. But this is really a journey? What do you know about journeys? What does that mean? I do not know. Some of us prefer keep in our safe corners. Some of us can not afford to wander around without a destination trying to find himself. At least I try I find myself. Why are you writing this book, have now? Nor have the courage to say why you fled. You know? You walk around saying that searches special person with whom to spend the rest of your life. But the truth is that you do not trust anyone. You know what? You never take a risk in your life! I'm risking everything to be here with you! What are you risking? You do not ran away from home. I was unwanted. Still needs much work. No. It's so free. It's what makes it so powerful. ? Hello? ? Hello .. ? What? ? When? ? No! You are good... ? Yes .. They will return soon. When? Tomorrow. Has some disinfectant? Good afternoon to you too. Sorry. I have a fungal problem. Well, let's see... Challenge someone to realize this system of organization men. What's happening? Nothing. Realize very afraid more than what you think. I had it marked until Sunday. I gotta go. Why do not you give a long walk, Chase? That's why I came here, right? It was the last thing I expected it to happen. I hope you do not think I'ma bad mother. I never think that. I do not want to lose perspective on whether your father and I had a wonderful marriage. I love him deeply. Could not ask for a better partner. And when I look back at the my life is difficult for me to imagine it without him. Gave me in crazy at times. And keeps on giving. But build something. Something meaningful. Ever made of it to do? No. He continues in St. Louis, at least the last time I had brave enough to look on the internet. Ever... think it? What is it? Just a little reminder. Everett, I... Hope you like it. I would like more if I could open. This might help. One for you... one for me. You have no remedy, you know that? Learned from the best. Promise me one thing? Five years from now... no matter where we are, no matter what happens... find ourselves in this exact location, at exactly this time. I promise. Do not forget that when you travel south of here, at the intersection of the road. I am no longer lost. We have arrived! Welcome. Hello My God, look what you grew up in a week! I like that t-shirt. What kind of ship you have here? His grandmother gave him, was not Billy? It's really cool, eh? Someone called? Just the usual. Let's put this to others, ok? How was your trip? Funny. The weather was good. Good. Everett, mold still in the shower. Sorry, I... OK. Guess I'll have to go to the store. - No. I can handle it alone. - No. Okay, seriously. Okay. Yes. I love you so much! Tell me what to do. Do not know if this will work, but it's just what they had. I have to leave for awhile. What's happening? Billy! What's happening? Billy, all is well, drop it baby. Billy! Alright! Billy's alright, he just goes out for a bit. I'll be back for you. Goodbye. Not delay. He said where he went? He mentioned one last stop but... can be anywhere. Five years later Someone is ready to sail. You come here first or go right to their parents? Depends on traffic. There are still many road works. Today just buying a model ship. Otherwise we have to enlarge the house. That's an order, Billy. Do you want something to Eureka? No. Just enjoy your day. No, no, no tires. Almost done. It's great, bro. He probably will not appear. It appears. You are the Everett? Yes. I've heard so much. My name is Jessica. We could talk? I do not believe. He never smoked a lifetime. Why did not he tell me? It happened so quickly, know? Until the end he thought it would improve. Chase knows... is an idealistic, right? At the time that morphine acted, he... hardly knew where I was. God, you would be so proud of him now. He continued to write, e. .. did some work with autistic children. The day before his death, was... incredibly lucid. He insisted that I was here, in Humboldt, this day this box. He said you was his favorite cousin. There is one more thing. Where is his key? Buried with him. ? Now, five years later time we meet we again ? so many things happened, so many things have changed, ? but as the very forests of redwoods, ? something... ? will always stand the test of time.
