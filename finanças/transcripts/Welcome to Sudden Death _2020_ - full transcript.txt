Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar. - Where are they? - No, no... Where are the rest of the troops? Tell me! - Where are they? - No! Hey, leave her alone. She doesn't know anything. String him up! - No, no. - Okay, American. Now you will tell me. Where are they? Where is your unit heading? Go kiss. What did he say? - Go kiss. - Go kiss? What is Go kiss? Go kiss. Go kiss my ass. What are you doing? I am getting the information we need! You killed him before we got the information! No matter. We got two left! Do not question me! I know what I am doing! How'd you get free? Let's just say those Cross-fit classes paid off. Get outta here! No time to defuse it. Go! Go! Morning, daddy. - Mara? - Mm-hmm. Please knock first. Come on. We can't be late. I wanna go on the first patrol with you. - You sure you're up to this? - Of course. I've been counting down all week. I was talking to your father. I've survived worse. I think I can handle this. Where's your brother? In bed, playing on his pad like he doesn't wanna go. Mara, can you give your father and me just a few minutes alone for some morning grown-up talk? Ew! So gross. - Uh, babe. - Hm? Morning grown-up talk? I think she even saw through that one. No. I actually wanna talk. Okay. Ever since you started this new job, you're hardly around. Look, babe, I gotta work, right? We got bills to pay. I'm just saying, you missed his last three ball games. And she just finally got her scouts badge. What happened to family first? Well, that's why I'm bringing them to work with me today, so we can have some quality family time, right? - All you do is work. - And, baby. You know what I've been going through, readjusting to civilian life, struggling to pay these bills. And now I'm finally feeling like the provider again. We miss you. And we need you. Ah-hah. "We." Me. - I hear you. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get them dressed. - Mm-hmm. And I'm going to make them some breakfast for their busy day with their daddy. You better get goin'. Mm. Mm. Mom, are you watching? Mara, I'm watching, I'm also working on not burning breakfast. Watching what? I was just trying to show mom the flying back kick you taught me. Okay. Let's see it. Let's see it. Okay, now remember, when you jump and land, that's when you extend your leg. Maybe she should extend her lip over her face. - That's it. I'mma kick ya ass. - Uh, Mara. This is what I have to deal with all day while you're at work. Ry, what'd I tell you about teasing your little sister, huh? - Apologize. - Why? You're not even here for some of the things she calls me. Hey. Watch that tone, young man. - And show some respect. - It's okay, babe. His little pre-teen hormones are kicking in. - Give me that. - Hey! No, we're gonna sit down and have breakfast and talk like a regular family. Let's scarf and go! Walking around the arena all day? - Sounds wack. - So you don't wanna go? No. Not really. Okay then, well, Mara and I will just enjoy the Falcons' game by ourselves. Whoo-hoo! The Phoenix Falcons' season opener? My favorite player, Micah Crews, just got traded to the Phoenix Falcons. Too bad you don't wanna go. Hm. What? Change your mind? Who cares about the stupid game. I just wanna go on patrol with you. Oh, well, I'm gonna have to play that one by ear, baby girl. Uh, now, I'm still learning my way around the job myself. - I guess it'll still be fun. - What are we waiting for? Let's go! I can't wait to see Micah Crews in action. I can't wait to see you in action, daddy! Probably not gonna be too much action for me, sweetie. This is just a regular day at the office. Hey, Freeman, these can't be your kids. They're adorable. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Hey, Jesse, what's up? - How you doin'? Daddy, is it always busy like this? Well, it all depends on who's in the venue. Well, today is a special day, not only because it's the Falcons' season opener, but the governor and the mayor are comin' to watch the game with the new stadium owner. - Guess who. - Who? - Diana Smart. - OMG, Diana Smart? When I grow up, I wanna be a genius billionaire just like her. Yeah, dream on. - Hater. - Stop. Why is the arena all thrashed out like that? Ms. Smart is doing renovations. Daddy, can we please meet her? Oh, sweetie, she is a very busy lady. - I doubt we'll even see her. - Okay. Yo, we have to bring out the big boy. Check my lady out, killin' it, as usual. Yeah, and so we checkin' out the spot where she's the owner doin' her thing, you know? Damn, girl, we like the new Jay and Beyonce up in this piece. We love you, Diane! We love you, Milli! Oh, we love you, too, baby. Give me a complete digital sweep. Yes, sir. Thompson here. Vendor key. I'm having Wi-Fi problems with system 12-B. The IT team I requested should be coming your way soon. I'll let you know when they arrive. - Copy that. - Right this way. - Our seats are right... - Hey, what's up, tight shirt? - Oh. - Good-lookin' kids right there. - Sure they're yours? - Guys, this is Gus. He's the, uh, maintenance engineer. So he's a janitor? Hey, I got an important job for you two today. Stay real close to your dad. Now he only gets lost, like, once a day now. You get lost? What a noob. I wish my dad would've taken me to work when I was your age. But I never knew him. Alright guys, let's go. And this is the security office. - Wow. - Wow. Got some good-lookin' kids there, Freeman. Are they yours? Why is everybody so amazed that I have good-lookin' kids? I mean, what am I, a troll? Dad, where's your gun? Guns don't make you safe, son. Strategy does. - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome. This is head of security, Devlin Montez. He's my boss. All my guards are given state-of-the-art security tablets to communicate with each other, and to track down any security problems here in the arena. The arena has the most sophisticated weapons detectors in the world. No one could get on to the lot with a small handgun and not be detected. So no gun, huh? Lame. Get your family situated. I'm gonna need all the guards on duty on first patrol. Our VIPs are already in the building. Yes, sir. Now... you guys are VIPs. - Cool. Jinx! - Cool. Jinx! Now, do not take those off as long as you're in this building. - You understand? - Mm-hmm. You and your hormones understand? Can we go now? I'm not trying to miss tip-off. Hey. We're here to fix the arena Wi-Fi. Wow. It's a lot of you for one job. You ever try to bounce a digital signal around 950,000 square feet of total space with a seamless signal? It's not a two-man configuration. Whatever. That's above my pay-grade, pal. We got the Wi-Fi tech crew here. - Send 'em up. - Copy that. Welcome to the arena, sports fans! And we got a packed house just rarin' to see an exciting basketball game. And we got new Phoenix Falcons superstar, Micah Crews, in the building. How does it feel to be playing on a new team this season? Your seats are right here. You didn't get us floor seats? These seats are wack. Well, how about you sit your little wack ass back in the car if you like? - I guess these will do. - You know what, dude? - Why don't you shut up? - So I will be back... I'm getting tired of hearing this. - I'm trying to enjoy a game. - Hey, hey, hey! - Can you stop? Please, stop. - You guys break it up. - Take your seats. - What're you gonna do about it? I'm warning you, do not put your hands on me, sir. - Sit down. - Kick rocks, rent-a-cop. - Okay, you're coming with me. - You mother... - Oh! - You're coming with me, too. - Let's go. - Come on, man. You two, stay put. Ryan's in charge till I get back. - But, daddy... - Stay put. - Come on. - Come on, dude. - He started this. - That's my daddy! Oh, snap. Man, the governor pullin' up on us. - We run this town, boy. - Hi. It is such a pleasure to see you again, Ms. Smart. - Oh. Thank you. - You look absolutely stunning. I told her that same thing in the limo. Your bodyguard is very observant. Oh, snap. Did he just call me the bodyguard? You know, I think what the, uh, what the governor here was trying to say is just that we're forever grateful to you, Diana, for taking your success and investing it back into our city. Well, of course, mayor. I was born and raised here. I grew up coming to the arena as a kid with my daddy, to watch the hockey games. It was my dream of one day being able to give back. You're also making us look good for re-election. Just remember why we're here, governor. Don't forget who you work for. The people. Don't forget about the 'hood, either. Oh, of course, of course. People first. Always. Love the 'hood. Um, shall we head to the owner's suite? I've got a few surprises for everyone. - Good idea. - Great. Governor's an asshole. I'm just sayin'. We got five minutes. Set it up! Two minutes, people! Let's make sure we don't blow our escape prematurely. You mean, like that time Beta lost his virginity in Guam? Almost pee on myself every time I think about that job. If she can't stay focused, maybe I should plant the bombs, Alpha. Now, that's funny. Be my guest, limp biscuit. Enough! Stay focused on Alpha. Yeah, you're right, you know, Gamma is a little crazy. But she's the best. Ain't that right, Gamma? But if you wanna handle explosives, be my guest. - Never mind. - What? Yeah. Just like I thought. Pussy. It's experimental weaponry. You get six shots each. They only work at close range. Make 'em count. Alright, we all know the end game. Wait for the signal. We all clear out after the fourth quarter. Oh, yeah, and, uh, have fun. Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the national anthem. Who's this? Third floor? Oh! Yo. You gotta switch to decaf, tight shirt. Ooh, sprinkles! Isn't there something you should be doing? - Doin' it! - I gotta get back to my kids. Hey, listen, man, the south hallway's that way. Just go straight, gets you right back in the action. No turns. - Can't get lost, tight shirt. - Alright. Alright. Jesse. But there's so much in here. - Here. - Thank you. Alright, follow me. Let's go, Falcons! Oh! Let's go, Falcons! Let's go, Falcons! Just wave your hand in front of there. Refrigerator, open. What? This is on to the next level-ish, bae. Mm-hmm. Can I take this on tour with me? - Only if you take me with you. - Oh, for sure. I got you. The renovations you're making to the arena are definitely impressive, Ms. Smart. The most impressive thing about The Odyssey is how we're providing job opportunities in both the green and tech sectors amongst minority vendors. Oh, now, see, that's what you should really be proud of, Diana, is creating opportunities. And making us all look good in the process. Asshole. - What? I said, "Let's roll." - Uh... Hey, guys. You guys new? - What's that? - You new? Oh, no, first day. Excuse me. Sorry. Hope I'm not interrupting something that's important. I mean, this is a room filled with very important people. Well, holy shit. You're Milli. That's Milli. Hey, uh, can I call you Milli? Um, I mean, I'm just a... I'm a huge fan. Yeah. Yeah, that was cool. I hate to admit it 'cause I'm more of a old-fashioned rock music kinda guy. In fact, I hate hip-hop. Security, is there something we can do for you? Uh, first of all, that's, uh... I have a small confession to make. We're not really security guards. Look, I'm just here to collect. Whoa! Hey, hey! Excuse me. Who are you? Me? Who am I? Well, my, members of my team there, they, they call me Alpha. That makes me the alpha. Yo, I know what this is. This is one of those prank shows, right? Where the camera at, babe? You in on this? Now, is he with you? Are you guys, like, some kind of like, uh, thing, Ms. Smart? Or can I call you Diana? Can I call you Diana? Diana it is. Alright, here's the thing. I'm only here for one reason and one reason only. Actually, uh, I lied. Uh, one billion reasons in your Digi-Coin. D... do you know who I am? I am the governor of this state. And on behalf of the United States government, you are in a no-win situation. America stopped negotiating with terrorists years ago. Terrorists? You're joking, right? No, tell me you're joking. You're not joking? Governor... I'm just here to get what's owed to me. Oh! No! Oh, my God! And I'm dead serious about it, too. I wonder when daddy's coming back. Who cares? I'm all about this game. Why are you so mean to him? Can't you see he's trying to be a good father and take care of us? Take care of us? He's a security guard. A nobody. A loser. Daddy's not a loser. He ain't a superstar like Micah Crews. Yeah, that's who I wish was my real daddy. - You take that back! - Now will you leave me alone? I'm so into the game. Where are you going? Sit down. I'm in charge, remember? You ain't in charge of my bladder. I gotta pee. Mara! Shooting, number thirteen. Can I get a glass of double, please? - Oh, man! - You know what, make it two. - Get her! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What do you wanna do with her now? What do you think? Get rid of her. I ain't killing no kids, man. I didn't sign up for this shit. Let's take her to Alpha. Let him deal with it. Hey! Another one of you's gonna die in the next quarter if my demands aren't met. How am I supposed to send you one billion? I can't just pull up my banking app for that. Oh, come on, Diana. You're not the only tech-savvy one in this room. You will enter routing numbers, bank accounts and PIN numbers into this. Once you get past the firewall, we will begin to transfer the Digi-Coin into our cloud. Block-chain tech. Clever. Oh. Now, is that a compliment coming from you? You can jump out the suite window. Babe, what is it... Don't piss the man off. Yeah, babe, why don't you listen to your dipshit boyfriend here? Now, if I can bring your attention this way, this little lady can hack into the entire Odyssey communications grid. Isn't that right? Remember what I did to that airport in Haiti? Oh, yes, I do. Do it. Beta? Why don't you cut me some slices? What you gonna do with that? Oh, God! No, no, no! Hey, come on, man, I'm too pretty to slice! Look, I still gotta record "The Booty Clap" video, man. You know what it is, man. I, I can't be looking like... - How come he looking crazy... - Relax, R and B. Gamma. Are you in play? I'm in the game. Communication scrambler attached. Alright. Falcons! Falcons! Falcons! - Ryan, where's your sister? - I don't know. What... what do you mean, "I don't know?" I... I know I left you in charge. She said she had to go pee. Son, you had one job. What was I supposed to do, make her sit here and pee on herself? You're supposed to go with... Did she have her security badge on her? My wife is gonna kill me. Sir, we've lost connection to all security tablets. Wait, Freeman is still online, sir. Oh, sh... shit. Someone's following us. What is... Let me see this. Damn, this is a VIP badge. - Encoded footprint. - Ah, shit. She's being tracked by security. She must belong to somebody important. Yeah, but we took out all the security. Obviously not. Hurry up, take this. You take him out. I got her. Come on, let's go. Come on, move. - Let me go! - Copy that. - Mara? - Daddy! Get up, go! No! Mara! Where are you going, Mara? Mara? Oh, come on. Oh, sorry, man. Where is she? Where is she? Where's who? This badge belonged to a little girl. Where is she? I don't know anything about a little girl, man. Oh, you think I'm playing, huh? Does it look like I'm playing now? Ah, that tech gun's way above your pay-grade, guard. Shut up, and tell me where she is. Chill. Stop. Stop. Okay. Brah. Come on, man. Man, stop doing that! Jesus, he's dead! Yeah, well, I don't know him. Yeah, you know what? I don't recognize any of these new guys. It's like they all got replaced. - New? - Yeah. You're the only one that I know. Something strange is going on here, man. Look, I have no time for this. I have to find my daughter. Come on. Jeez. - I can't wait. - For what? To watch my daddy kick your ass. Yeah, that'll be a neat trick. Man, get up here. My shoelace! Get up. I said keep it movin'. Can't a sister tie her shoe? What if I fall and hurt my cute self? Hm? - Hurry up. - Fine! Damn. I hate kids. I've taken care of all communication, digital and Wi-Fi signals in the stadium. I've also disconnected all of our lines before second quarter, as scheduled. Yes! The Odyssey is mine! What? Too cliche? You know, I'm picking up a lot of heat coming from your direction. You got something you wanna say to me, Ms. Smart? I know you. Jobe. Jobe Davis. Ex-CIA, counterterrorism agent. Well, holy shit. I'm starting to understand what this is all about. What this about? This is about what you did to me. What you did to my team. That's what this is about. Okay, excuse me, mister, I... All that I'm trying to say is, whatever she did, I'm gonna be the first to apologize for her. What in the hell did you do to this dude? Jobe Davis mistook an innocent American family for a Muslim terrorist cell and killed them. A mother and father with two kids, six and eight. I hired a team of attorneys to uncover the truth. They discovered that Mr. Davis was responsible during an illegal raid on their home. Everybody makes a mistake on the job. A mistake? That family is dead because of you! Which resulted in the destruction of my life, including my family and destroying the lives of my team. You. You ever experience anything like what's happening right now? No. I... I think it just hit me. Like, you really killed that dude. I might have PTSD. I'm talkin' about the Wi-Fi, not the murder and stuff. This whole situation's nuts, man. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Excuse me. Uh, where is Devlin? - Run. - Right now? Go! Shirt, this way! - You sure? - Trust me! - Shit. - Which way? I don't know. Fuck it. Those guys are assholes! I think I pulled my hamstring. Thanks for locking that. We'll be good in here. I, uh... Sorry about the mess. I don't get a lot of visitors normally. I can see why. It's like the John McClane shit. - What? - "Die Hard." You never seen "Die Hard?" Bruce Willis? Like, all these terrorists, they took over this Nakatomi Building and he's like "Yipee ki-yay, motherfucker!" Hey! - What the hell, man? - Watch the pens. You're talking about a movie? I'm talking about real life here. Could you just please show me a safe route out of here so I can find my daughter? We can take the east hallway. Uh, that's the quickest way we'll get to 'em and it... it's always empty during game time. - Come on. - Thanks. Sorry about your pens. Shit. I don't have time for this shit. I'm only gonna tell you this one time. You do that again, and I'mma cut you in pieces. Go! See? Told you. There's nobody around. Who's that? Excuse me. Oh. Hey there. - Where's your badge? - It's my first day on the job. And where's your security pad? Oh, must've left it in the break room. She's lying. Uh, what is she, five-seven, 125? - I got this. - Gus... Ah-ah-ah... You got the last one. So you're tellin' me you don't have your security badge or your security pad? Like I said, it's my first day. Got her! I don't got her. All of you were supposed to be dead. I'll call you a paramedic. Just tell me where my daughter is. I have no idea what you're talking about. Who are you with? It's too late. The clock is ticking, and you can't stop it. - Gus, get her earpiece. - Uh-unh! She already kicked me once. Hold this. - Ah! - Unh! When the game is over, you're all dead! Yo, that is one crazy bitch! Now let's look at this bomb. Bomb? Holy shit! This is a Ping-Pong bomb. Activated via remote, or motion-sensitive. These are designed for maximum collateral damage in close basis, or for troops in one place. Or like a large crowd leaving an arena. You sure you know what you're doing? - Can you back up a little bit? - Sorry. And... disarmed. Just one of these has the potential to kill hundreds. I say we get your son out of here, get him safe, call the cavalry. I'll be very honest with you. I'm not getting paid enough for this. No, I'm not gonna send my son through exits rigged with explosives. There could be more of these, like, at every exit. There's, like, a dozen main exits in this arena. You heard what she said, right? The clock is ticking. I have to do something to stop this. Besides, my daughter is still in this place. It's gonna be suicide, man. Well, then I'll commit it saving lives. You can't save everyone by yourself. You're right. But maybe with your help? Hell, no! The entire arena layout. Look, all the exits, right there. Yeah. They're the most logical places to plant a bomb. So we'll start there. We also need a solid way to communicate, should we get split up. Ooh! Analog, baby! They'll never hear us on these frequencies. There you go. Well, we got a lot of ground to cover, and time is not on our side. My girl Bessie'll help. Who? Tight shirt, meet Bessie. Go, Bessie. Fuck, yeah. Diana didn't have anything to do with your mistake. Mayor, you're really starting to piss me off. Sit. You know, someone like Diana Smart there, who has money, they play both sides, judge and jury. You don't know how dangerous my job was, how many innocent people I protected. I protected. How many years I served my country and how quickly she took it away. Look, I'm sorry you lost your family, but they're alive, the Faakhirs are not. You're damn right you're sorry. And that's why you're gonna pay. Anything hit the account? Nothing yet. Hey, please don't kill me! Look, I just started working on my second album, man. - Kill her, kill her! - Just give him the loot! Listen to R and B here. Virtual currency transfers take time. - Please be patient. - Stop playing me, Ms. Smart. You keep playing me, I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna kill the mayor, here, I'm gonna kill your dumbass boyfriend. - Shit! - Alright? I'm gonna kill everybody in this goddamn arena. Get up. Come over here. Come here. Turn around. It's your turn. You're gonna choose... - Who dies next. - No. Yes. Is it gonna be the honorable mayor? Or your Booty Clap R and B boyfriend? - You choose. - Come on, man. - Who is it gonna be? Do it. - Bae. Look, I know you're not gonna let them kill me, right? My album's streaming top 100. Y'all know how hard it is to do that? If anything, you shoot the mayor, goddammit. She ain't even helping the black community properly. Really? - Just calm down, Milli. - Calm down? Bitch, I ain't tryin' to die. Yo, no, don't, don't shoot me. - Man. Come on, man. - Wait, wait, wait! We have an incoming deposit. You know, I knew I could count on you to do the right thing. It's not so easy to pick who lives or dies, is it? Now go sit your ass down. What we got? Good. Let's check in with Gamma. Looks like Gamma's only got one more bomb to activate. Who'd try to bomb a basketball arena? There's kids, there's old women. That's not cool at all, man. Gamma, where are we at with the last bomb? Hello? Who's this? An arena security guard. Who's this? - What's your name? - Let's start with yours first. Well, I'm Alpha. I'm running the security now. Okay, Alpha, where's Devlin? Oh, we've briefed the new security on duty. Why don't you tell me your location? We'll bring you up to speed. I think I'm already up to speed. I'll find you. How's that? Hello? Alright, listen up. We got a rogue security guard on duty. I want you to find him, take him out. Copy that. Well, now, who do we have here? This opener between the Falcons and the Knights is just giving you nail-biting intensity. Dad, did you find Mara yet? No. I... Um, I... I just came to check on you. I wanna help you look for her. If you wanna help, stay here, okay? - It's the safest place for you. - Why can't I help you? If your sister comes, I need you here waiting for her. Son, I need you to be a soldier right now. I need you to follow orders. No matter what happens, no matter what you hear or see other people do, I need you to hold your position. Do you copy? Yes, sir. Okay. Alright. I'll be back, son. Move! Get out of the way! I'm tryin' to save your life! Get out of the way! We'll cut through Concession C. It's faster. Move! Get out of the way! Okay. Let's check the northeast exit ahead. Yup, got another one. Pull over right here by this exit. No way! So you're not gonna tell us your name? I don't talk to strangers. Didn't your mama teach you that? As a matter of fact, she did. Told you. She's got a smart mouth. Somebody needs to shut her up permanently. - You leave her alone. - Relax, Ms. Smart. No one's gonna hurt the girl. Sit. I'm a huge fan, by the way. Thanks. - How old are you? - Almost eleven. But I already feel that black-girl magic. I have a little girl around your age. She's cute like you, too. Her mother left me and took my daughter with her. I can see why, loser. Oh, I'm far from being a loser. In fact, today I'm gonna win it all. How we lookin'? Still on track. Digi-Coin coming in. Good. I can't wait till my dad finds me. He works here in the arena. He's probably looking for me right now. Oh, really? Why don't you tell me more about your daddy? Start of the third quarter, 95. Did you find anything? I have searched every entrance to this wing. Then we need to get the message to everyone in this entire place at the same time, to leave through the exits we know are safe. How? How do I get to whoever controls this? Oh, take this hallway all the way to the end. It dead-ends at a elevator. Listen, take the elevator to the top floor. When the doors open, just keep going straight. It ends at the Jumbotron operator's office. Guy's name is Al. Knock twice. I'mma stay here and keep looking. Okay, if you find anything, don't touch it. Call me. Oh, I'm not touching shit. Man. - You ever heard of knocking? - I'm sorry. But this is an emergency. We're all in trouble. What do you mean, "We're in trouble?" The arena security's been taken over by outside hostiles. Man, whatever you smokin', you need to give me some, 'cause this job is boring as hell. - I'm not... - Look, look. Look. Do you know what this is? - No. - It's a bomb. Would you like to see how it works? Is that a rhetorical question? Are you sure you really want me to send this message out? 'Cause this, this, this message is gonna evacuate the entire arena. That's exactly what we want. Man. If this comes back on me, I'm gonna tell 'em that you held me hostage with a bomb! Fair enough. Now would you just please send the... Oh, whoa. No, no. No! Please, no! No! Ah! Oh, s... sorry. Sorry, sir. You okay? Freeman. I'm surprised you're still alive. I'd assumed they killed all the guards. You stuck around even when you realized something was off. My daughter's missing. I can't find her and I'm not gonna leave without her. I'm really sorry to hear this, but I need you to stay focused and finish telling me everything you know. Well, whoever they are, they're professionally trained. Prototype weaponry, maybe, uh, covert or special-ops trained. Maybe even a terrorist cell. - Anything else I should know? - Well... They planted motion-sensitive explosives at the exits. I managed to dismantle most of them, I think. I always knew you were an exceptional employee. A man that would do anything to protect. - That's why I hired you. - But, sir... What do you suggest we do to take them out? Well, I think the first thing, unfortunately, is... taking you out. Really? Spider. Caught the fly. - Excellent. - You're with them? How could you betray your own people? Life isn't about loyalty, son. It's about green, lots of it. - Continue to surprise, Freeman. - Shut up! You don't know anything about me. If I submitted my real resume, you would've been too afraid to hire me. Now take out your cuffs and get on the ground before I put one in your leg. Can't do that. Okay. Have it your way. I don't care who you really are. You're still gonna die. - Hello? - Where's Devlin? He's on break. Jesse, did you kill your boss? How do you know my name? Oh, well, a little birdie told me. - Daddy! - Mara! She's a cute little girl. Smart mouth, though. I swear, you touch her, you die. You stay out of my way, allow me to finish what I started, she'll be just fine. What if I can't do that? Well, then your daughter will be one of many who die today. Where are you? Come on. - Where you hiding? - I'm not hiding from you. Actually, I got the best seats in the house. So you stay off my grid, and maybe your daughter will live to see 11. I've got intel on our security guard. Putting it up on the screen now. "Jesse Freeman. Unconventional warfare operations." "Airborne, demolitions, hand-to-hand expert." "Counterterrorism and recon." - Jesus. - I told you he was a badass. Now, don't get cocky, kid. My team's gonna eat your daddy for breakfast. Hang on a second. Freeman has a VIP badge assigned to him. Onscreen now. - Now who do we have here? - Leave my brother alone. Oh, I don't believe in breaking up families, kid. That's Ms. Smart's job. Especially children. Omega, bring his dumb ass back here. Excuse me, young man. - Last name Freeman? - Who are you? I work with your dad. He asked me to come and get you. But my dad told me not to go anywhere. Hm. Smart kid, huh? But your dad sent me anyway, so come on, let's go meet him. My daddy told me to stay put, no matter what. Look, man, I don't have time for this. Get your ass up. Stranger danger! Stranger danger! Hey, you. Leave that kid alone! - Man, sit your ass down! - Hey! Digi-Coin's still transferring. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Wish I could say the same, murderer. Hm. It could've gone much worse. Come on, it wasn't such a total loss for ya. At least we found out before it got too serious that your boyfriend was a bitch-ass. Hey, man, come on! I'm just trying to live! Sit down! You're gonna let us go alive, right, man, Mr. Sir Alpha? Don't start kissing my ass just yet. 'Cause if someone's daddy decides to play hero, I'm gonna send your ass and everyone in this arena on a one-way ticket to the after-party. And that's not just an evil cliche, Ms. Smart. Found him. He's in section 301. Omega, Delta, Zeta. - Fly's in section 301. - We're on our way. - Kill him. - Copy that. Mara! Oh, I... I'm so sorry. I... Oh, okay. Now, he said the best seats in the house. Dad! Giving it all to you today, sports fans. Hey! - I'm working here! Hey! - Move! Move! Where's my daughter? - Where's my daughter? - Owner, owner's suite... - Owner's, owner's suite. - Thank you. These two teams are battling it out here at the start of the fourth quarter. Dad, where are you? The owner's suite, huh? See, that makes sense. That's where the rich people go to watch the games. Nobody would ever think to look for the bad guys there. Well, assuming they've the same weapons as the other bad guys, I need the element of surprise. Yo, shirt. You go in through this way, surprise the hell out of everyone. Well, looks like I got no other choice. You're gonna need this. I'm gonna need a lot more than... What? Look. I gave you the money. Now just go. You and I both know I can't just walk out of here. Just killing you, that wouldn't be enough, would it? No. I need something bigger. I'm gonna call it the, uh, Bloody Escape. Pretty good, huh? Please, don't hurt the innocent citizens in the stadium. They just came to see the game. Who, these people? Fuck 'em. Psi. Thank you, Psi. This is for you. Yeah, go on, take it. Open it up. Now you see, Diana. Your name, your face, everything that you built has haunted me for two years. Soon I'm gonna fly away from here, look down on you like a fucking God and watch everything that you built... be destroyed. Boom. Oh, man, we missed one! Fuck! Goddamn it! Thirty seconds left in the period. We're not gonna make it. How did he do it? Five, four, three, two, one! Micah Crews, two-pointer, Falcons. Tie game. You know, I couldn't have planned this any better. The audience is all gonna stick around for the amazing conclusion, and all exit virtually altogether and chaos will still reign supreme. And by the time the cops have dealt with the fallout, I'm gonna be long gone. Micah Crews has a chance to win the game for his new team. Blue. White-blue. Eeh! Oh, no. I should have called in sick! Shh! Shh! What's that sound? Oh, yeah. This is "Game Over." - Drop it! - Daddy! - Hey, sweetie. - Alright. Now you must be the security guard. - You must be Alpha. - Hi. No, no, no, no... Micah! Micah! Mi... You're too late. No, no, no. No, please don't blow. Please don't... - Let's go! Let's go! - Hey! What happened? What happened to the explosives? That's right. We defused your little game, player. Hey, freeze. - Don't move. - Wait a minute. That's just a T-shirt gun. Kill him! Refrigerator open. - Come on, come on. - Daddy! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! - Go! Alright. - Daddy! Oh, hell, yeah. Much love, black man. - God bless you, man. - He said he's flying away. My guess is he's heading to the helipad on the roof. Take the main stairway to the rafters. I'll shout you out on my next album, man! Ladies and gentlemen, please proceed to the nearest exit. Keep movin', kid. Hey! Daddy! Breaking news live from The Odyssey Center. There have been reports of explosions from inside the arena. Emergency crews are arriving at the scene, but no confirmation of injuries or fatal... Oh, my God. This is a breaking news item, live from The Odyssey Arena. - Let me go! - Hey! Let my daughter go and I'll let you live. Yeah, okay. You can have her back. - In a few minutes, in pieces. - Argh! - Ow! - Stay. Daddy. Your guns don't work that far, anyway. At least I figured that out. I had a perfect plan, and you fucked it all up. Kick his ass, daddy! Kick his ass! Dad. Mara. - Ah! - Uh! Daddy, look out! - Ah! - Daddy! Leave my daddy alone! Boo. - Daddy! - No! Daddy, don't drop me. Ah. You can do this, daddy. You can do this. Ah! Come here, sweetie. We gotta get this off of you. Hurry, daddy. Daddy. Hurry, daddy. Hold on, baby girl. You know, I wish I could stick around for this sweet moment, but I think I hear my ride pulling up. Plus, I just hate bad endings. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna kill you and your bitch daughter there and call it a day. Fuck. Enjoy your last few seconds together. Hey. Remember me? You bitch. You just fuckin' killed us all. - Uh, sweetie, are you hurt? - No. - Are you okay? - It could be worse. If I came home without you, your mom would kill me. Hey. You saved my life and everyone in the arena. Uh, how did you figure out how to work that gun? Basic thumb-press safety switch. Okay. Hey, let's go get Ryan. - Yeah. - Yeah. Alright. - Son. - Dad. Mara! I was so worried. Were you really worried about me? Yeah. I saw the whole fight on the rafters. - You were amazing. - Amazing? - He was lit. - Let's go. Um, let's just keep this whole day between us, okay? Nope. Hey. How about you consider a new job, as head of my security? Oh, you know, I really appreciate that, but I'm a 9:00 to 5:00 guy from now on. I need to be home, really home, with my family, you guys. - Family first, right? - Yeah. I understand. Just know the new job pays seven figures. This family has bills to pay. We'll get back to you in 24 hours. Is she for real? Yo! Jessie. - You guys need a lift? - Uh, this is my partner, Gus. - Oh, thank God! - Mom! Babies, are you guys okay? We had the best adventure with daddy today. Did you know dad's an action hero? Actually, I did. - Hey, babe. - Baby. Hello. Yeah. - It's not as bad as it looks. - Oh, sweetheart. Yes. Come on, guys. Come on. - Help daddy out. - Can you walk? - Yeah, yeah. - Slowly, slowly, slowly, guys. Dad, you really need to get to the hospital. Hey, you're right. You're right. I sure do love a happy ending. Oh-oh. Get your popcorn ready. Welcome to Sudden Death! The security guard said there're three bodies in here. Where's the other one?
