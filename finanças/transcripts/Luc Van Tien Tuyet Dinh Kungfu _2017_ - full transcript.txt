I'm the main actor, the star! Are you blind? Hey, stop! Stop now! Hey! Stop! Hey! - Teo! - Yes! What the hell are you doing? Yes... Yes. I'm so sorry. Watch out or you will lose your job. This is your final chance. Thank you! I just have the first chance. Can you believe this? Beside me is a piece of gold. No! A block of pure gold. An author is moving with his horse. I swear I speak the truth this time. God! The amount of money I owe you, right? Okay. Now, it's just a piece of cake. Just hold on. - Stay away! - He looks familiar... Haven't I seen him before somewhere? In the textbook? Right! The same drawing is in this book. It is Van Tien! Luc Van Tien! Tien! Who's Tien? That crazy horse! Stay away! It kicks the hell out of you. Hey. Bill, please! Thirty thousand dongs. What kind of clothes is that? Maybe he was filming. But he looks handsome, by the way. Do you see anything strange? The world is very dangerous. I don't think you should use your real name. Just use a stage name. What is a stage name? To avoid trouble and curiosity, your name from now on will be... LVT! - LVT! - That's good. Hurry up! After this, I will take you to meet clients. What clients? Filming, photoshoots, advertising, everything. - Filming, advertising... - Exactly! What is that? Just do what I tell you. Do you get it? Go! - Where are you taking me to? - Go. Where are we going? Let me go. Hey! That is not your business. - Sit down. More beer, please! - Okay. How is this batch, bro? So bad! What's your name? Nga. - Bill, please! - Yes! So, who will pay? Hey, come over here. We have to pay her for the food. This is money. Give me all you have. I don't have money. Looking at your glorious suit and mannerisms, I thought that you were rich. Named "fairy" but don't have "money"? I did not know because everything is free up there! Oh my God! Rustic. Good! Very good! Take off your clothes! Catch her! Nga, stop! Nga? Let me go! This white horse is unique. -If you don't take a photo of it now, -Here you are. the price will go up five or seven times when it is sent to the circus. Come on! I'll offer you a discount of 10,000 dongs. No need to go to Thao Cam Vien or Dalat. Come on! Okay! Cash on delivery. Money for the bill. Your tip! Oh, sorry. Thank you. Hey, wait! Let her go, you bullies. Don't do harm to the innocent villagers! Who do you think you are? Huh? He thinks he's good. Even if I have to walk to the end of the Earth, I will find her by all means. Hey! Where did you go? I don't know where she is. Okay! I will find her for you later. First, you must earn money to pay your debt. The noodle bill. - Okay? - Okay. Remember to study after your meal! Don't make trouble. Come on! - Yes! - Hey! What? - What? - Let's go! You have money to pay the debt? Now, the debt is not a problem. Come on! What do you think? Is it good? What do you think about this beautiful horse? This is a unique one. Can this be a circus horse? Circus? Let me ask him. Can you be a circus horse? Wow! He says it's as easy as duck soup. What about that guy? God! With him, it is even smaller than the bunny. Two, three. Tam! Tam! Are you okay? I told you not to make trouble. Why do you always make trouble? - You... - Ah... Thank you so much! You are so good. Without you, I don't know... So, my debt is paid, okay? Dasher Bui, may I get you a lotus tea as usual? I'm not in the mood. Bring the wine! Only the Mistress can help me forget that sadness and anger. What makes you look so unhappy, Dasher Bui? The customer agreed to buy my item at a good price. Then, a strange guy appeared and disturbed us, so, the deal failed. Hey, stop! - Let go of me! - Stop! - Stop it, please! I told you no! - Hey! You think you're so special? - Don't you want a tip? - Let me go! Don't you want it? What the hell are you doing? Making a mark so you will never come back here again. What did I do? What's up? Let me go! What did I do to get arrested? Stay away from me! I wish some of my guards were as brave as you. Bro, we found that man. - Go get him! - Yes. Who is that dangerous man? I don't know! A weird man with an ancient costume that came out of nowhere. It is my pleasure to introduce the first exciting horse circus act performed by the famous actor LVT! PINK LOTUS THEATER Dammit! Time's up! Hurry up. Let's take a group shot. No time for individual shots. One, two, three. Smile! Done! Group photo but individual rates. Ten thousand each, please. Hurry up! Time's up! LVT! Focus on the performance. I will find that girl for you. LVT! LVT! Get off the stage. Boo! Get out. Oh my God! Get off the stage! I can even find ten people named Nga at once. Today was very hard. Hey! You are in the wrong place. I'm sorry! I'm starving. Why do I keep on meeting poor people today? - Sit down! - Yes. Eat it! - Yes. - Make yourself at home. Thank you! I am not easy as I look. I earned good money just by having a horse photographed. - Count it! - What? Count it. Don't hesitate! Count it! I hold in my hand a super weapon. A showbiz bomb. More importantly, I must find a girl named Nga tonight. After that, I will become a manager. My money! Stop! Stop! - Run? Stop! - Somebody, help me! Don't robbers take money? Is it just jealousy? Where is your home? Why are you out so late by yourself? I live in the countryside. I was seduced in coming here. They said I could earn good money. But it's not true. Outside, there are so many cheaters that seduce young girls. Turning young girls into toys. Now, you can stay here. I will have my people teach you how to make tea. I have been lonely and miserable. Now, you help me. Thank you so much. Tie him up. Take him to the police! God! I am innocent. My butt! Selling fake products to me is the reason why they fought and created a mess. Do you know how much damage you caused? Not to mention, my head was nearly hit. Now, you are complaining. Complain more? I don't know what happened as I wasn't here. Alright! I will check the damage, then I will treat you. My God! I am really innocent. Okay, if you agree to leave the horse here. Release him! Hey, wait! Where are you going? You can stay at my place for now. We are brothers. We can share rice. - Still have some money. - Who is that? - We can live modestly. - He is such a weirdo. He is strange, isn't he? Mom, his outfit is so weird. Hey! A historical drama. Nothing to see. Is it a Sun Wukong film? Zhu Bajie. - Let's go. - Yes. This is my mansion. It's small but comfortable. TV. Lights. Come here! This is the kitchen. And this... the toilet! This is the refrigerator. Take food whenever you feel hungry. Fruit is always available. Hey, that water is not for drinking. Come here! Oh my God! What's wrong with you? Oh, God! Your head looks like Son Goku. But this outfit... Hey! Why are you guys so slow? We want to come quickly, but it's a little hard. Nga! Stop! Stop! - Help me! - Stop! - Nga! - Hey! - Stop! - They got her. Nga! Here come the noodles. Where is he? What happened? What happened? Why did you let him in and make a mess? Call security. Take him out immediately! Yes! - Get out of here. - Get out! Hey! Sorry! - Nothing! - Get out! Go! Bro, that man looks like him. Hey! Stop! One is like a man of eternity, the other is like a psycho. How come they look similar? Are you blind? Sorry, bro. Come back to the apartment. Let me get more suitable clothes for you. Okay. In the afternoon Stand on The west side of the west floor West floor west See you mourning but carrying water Watering the parasol tree Is that you, Teo? A cat eating on the sly doesn't sound like that. You have to learn more, son. Dad, I am sorry. I have an urgent matter. I have to go. Oh no! - What did you take? - I... There is nothing worth selling, right, Teo? You make me... Dad! I am sorry. I don't want to make you sad! Dad! Is it that difficult to become a good man, son? Huh? I am trying to do good things now, Dad! What did you take? Give it to me! Oh, God! Teo! These clothes, I wore to the engagement ceremony with your mom the other day. Do you know that? How dare you... God! I have no words! - Take it! Get out! - Dad! It's for my friend. He only has one shirt. What? Is he poor? Right! No. He might look rich, but actually, he is very poor. He has no money, Dad. Dad! I will give you one more chance. The last time! Okay? Did you find her? Yes. Sir, the owner will prepare welcome tea for the esteemed guests. Good! Understand? Pleasure! Sit down! Where are you from that you speak so many languages? I am an international citizen. The world is flat! Our Noble runs all sorts of business. Where there's money, he can be found. Money is hot, but there are other hotter things. That's... - Oh no! - I am sorry. Sweetie, bring a towel for the Noble! Hey! Help! Urgent help, please. Hurry up! Press it! Go to the clinic! Hurry up! The top floor! Are you kidding me? God! Very urgent! Please! You said it's an emergency, but she is not here yet. I beg you. Oh my God! More! Don't stop! Excellent! Come on! More! Has it come out yet? Ready for a recovery injection. Done! PET CLINIC - EMERGENCY Done! A healthy delivery! What golden hands he has! Oh my God! So cute! Don't tell anyone, please! You want to leave without saying goodbye, don't you? I am sorry! Tell me. Who are the two guests? Why do you avoid meeting them? They are chasing me. Luckily, I was saved. This man... Did he save you? Yes! Oh, God! He is so good at fighting. Last time, he didn't need to fight, but they all fell down. Hello! Dasher Bui speaking! I have news that will surely interest your noble boss. You have my attention! What news? About the girl you are chasing. Is that right? I am looking for her. I know where she is! Getting married to a foreign husband. He is a rich man. You are as happy as a lark. Crying for what? Hello? We have an audition. Why is no one coming? Alright, we charge for our waiting time. - They are coming. - No! The film crew must have vehicles and lights. Someone is crying! Come on. It's none of our business! So troublesome with this old-time wedding. Damn heavy! Come! Hurry up! Bride gets off the palanquin! The groom comes to take the bride! Hi! Hey! Oh no! We consider the protocol completed. Take the bride to the boat. Come on! Come on! Stop! Don't touch her! Who are you that dares... Take the law into my hands. I will never forgive the criminals. Guys! It's a little difficult! Are you scared of this guy? Bro, this guy is not easy. Don't go! Allow me! Help me! Hurry! Hurry up! Teo! Take her away! Chase her! Take him down for me! Quick! I'm tired. It hurts. - Hurry up! - I get in trouble when I'm with you! Guys, stop! - Which way? - This way. - There they are. - Hide there! Hurry up! I saw them running this way! Are they going away? Keep quiet. Yes! Not yet. Stay here! Close your eyes! Be careful! They will see us. - What's up? - It tickles. I didn't do anything. What tickles? No, it tickles below. So, do I... Do you want to take advantage of me? You bastard! Hey! Where are you going? They are still there. Get in the queue. Hurry! - God! Why are you pushing me? - Calm down. The bigger birds stand in front, the smaller ones go to the back. All must be in sequence. It's crowded today. I am suffering! This bird is very small. Go back! Here! It's big! Go ahead! This stands here. Hey! That's so big. Go ahead! Stand in front. It's the biggest. Oh my God! Very good! So excellent! Too neat! God! The birth delivery master in the lift is over there! Master! What a weird vet. Why are his clothes all wet? He must have done a fish birth. Hurry! Master! Introduce yourself! Birth delivery master. She has not run away yet. She is somewhere here. Split up! Catch her! What? I am going to be caught. No. Hey! It's me! What? Turns out it's you. I thought it was a robber. Change clothes. Come with me immediately! Go where? For an advert? No. I'm taking you to her. Who is she? Who is she? What? Wine! Tonight you drank so much! Did you lose? Lost! Lost miserably! Lost all your money? So, is there no tip for me? I lost! I was defeated by LVT. Why does he always defeat me? Hey! I'm here! If it rains in the meeting scene, it will be called lasting rain. Such a romantic scene. Did you have to wee, bird? I'm Nga, who you saved! But you have changed so much coming here! I have always been here. My home is a hick town. Strange. The two of them... Why is their reunion not like that of Nguu Lang and Chuc Nu? It's strange. Do you come from overseas? No, from the above! Where is the above? There! I passed through nine levels of clouds to find you. In the past, we could understand each other with just a glance. What has caused you to change so much, Nguyet Nga? Who is Nguyet Nga? My name is Mong Nga! So, you are not Nguyet Nga, who was kidnapped from the sky? I get it! It means both people are called Nga, but she is Mong, not Nguyet. She was also kidnapped, but lives in a hick town, not in the sky. Hey! Where are you going? To find Nguyet Nga. Is it an interrogation? LVT! Stop these enticing and bribing jobs! This party is just for you. Enjoy it! The job is not completed. I'm so sorry. For the groom, I will compensate appropriately. No need! Look! Hello. But LVT came out of nowhere. His eminent kung fu is so fast and dangerous. Only then do we know who a friend is and who an enemy is. What you mean is...? Take a guess. I asked LVT if he is from overseas. He said he is from the above. Where is this "the above"? I don't understand. So easy to know. Here! Let's open Google maps. This is overseas. - The above is Canada. - Yes. Above the above is the North Pole. Full of white snow. See? Who did you take the photo with? LVT. At that time, he just came down from the above. Looking at the painting, his mistress's face looks strange. Could she be the Nguyet Nga who LVT is looking for? Nguyet Nga. I have found you everywhere! Who did you find? Don't you remember me? We are engaged. Now that we meet, why do you...? You are mistaking me for someone else. No! You are Nguyet Nga! Anybody? Nguyet Nga. Nguyet Nga. Poor man! He'll get hurt if he keeps punching like this. You should care about the palm tree. His hands are difficult to get hurt! Teo! Yes? Why are you so clumsy? We say, "Cut off his nose to spite his face." I understand what you mean. Sorry! Are you okay? Serves you right. Did you find him? I saw him everywhere last night, but he went MIA. Poor man! He might suffer after the rejection, right? Because he's so kind. His kung fu is eminent, but his manner is feeble. Things will be different when it comes to me. It's easier said than done. Do you dare to reject me? If I do, then what? I'll throw myself on you. - It tickles! - Stop! He... It's me! Teo! Have you been lying here all night? What's wrong with you? Maybe the coconut knocked me out. Hey! You! Thank you. Last night, even though we were in danger, you still tried to save him. Thanks to this. Plus a karaoke system and a large speaker. You're so smart. Mistress, there's trouble. I heard LVT came here to harass you. I brought people to help you. Why are you so late? Do you want to check? We always believe you! Who are "we"? I would like to drink with the lady to cheers on our special relationship. Thank you very much for your sincerity. Dasher Bui always praises your talent. Especially your delicate business relationships. It depends on how we use it. Isn't that right, Noble? I don't think so. I think that if we have faith, we'll have a relationship. Is that right? And the fourth person is...? It's the best warrior. Please! Sir, the goods from the highland just arrived! It arrived? Good! Very good! I bit my tongue. Why are you here? I have a concern. Why is the fourth person selected strictly? LVT is not a normal guy. We need a superior to fight him. The Noble is a far-sighted person! Thank you for your kindness. But it's time to go. There is no exception! Stop! Before you go, can you play a final chess game with my father? It is a strategy to postpone him. My father is awesome. Wish you were half the man he is. It's said that "If the child surpasses his father, the home is blessed." Keep waiting! Nguyet Nga! Luc Van Tien, help me! Even if I have to walk to the end of the Earth, I will find her by all means! - Van Tien! - Nguyet Nga! You... You're so beautiful. Let me go! Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Prepare a car for me! Yes! Retailing is outdated. Not only little profit but also more risks. We need to change our business method. With my support, I hope that our goods will be catchier and more valuable. Sir, I have good news! How is your kung fu? Show it! I don't need to learn kung fu. Boxer Trinh, although his legs are not strong, his arms can fight 100 people. Stop! The button of your jeans will pop off. I told you so! Good! Very good! Oh my God! Excellent! No foreign language is needed. I'll speak Vietnamese from now on. So wonderful! Darling! Do you need the toilet? I want to ask you a question. If I die, will you marry another? No, never! You're a liar! Trust me! I'm not that foolish to meet another lion. - So, you're saying I'm a lion? - It tickles! Hey, be careful! We'll both fall down. When Teo's mother died, I was desperate and hurt. I cried beside my wife's tomb for three days and nights. My eyes couldn't see anything. God! That time, I wanted to die. Thanks to this instrument, I felt better. Play it for me. Play it! Find your own faith. No. You are Nguyet Nga. Guards! Nguyet Nga. Sometimes I miss you so much and just want to return. Many nights I lie awake, expecting your warm hands. Love will boost my strength to help me. My guess is right. Van Tien! Van Tien! Let me go! No! They paid a 25% deposit. Good! Good! Good! Hey! How can you be so rude to such a nice girl? What do you want from me? Many things! Because you are a secret every single man wants to discover. I want to know why you brought Nga to me but still told LVT to save her? If I did not gain your trust, how else would I get here? Knowing kidnapped girls are imprisoned here. Shut up! Your curiosity kept me from acting. And the call of love made you come to LVT and expose you. Bro, she is too dangerous! I love dangerous girls. Stop! Let her do the perfect dance. I'm Teo! Teo! Sleeping beauty, do you need a prince? Leave. They will catch us. Noble is as good as God. I give up. A wise person knows when to lose. Do you want to know about our conspiracy? The shipment will be taken across the border. Marriage procedures are passed and we'll sell at a higher price. You got it? For safety, we must find an unexpected time. Why are you laughing? Dozens of girls across the border. Do you think it's easy? Right! It's not easy. But if I bring them on New Year's Eve, when the entire city is enjoying the fireworks, is that very good? Is that very good? Is that very good? Is that very good? Huh? Huh? Who? Who dares to fart while I'm discussing business? Who? Stop! Wait! Be gentle. Hello. Where are you? Are you playing with a girl? Don't talk nonsense. Is LVT there? It's urgent! Hurry up! Get down. Stop! I have an idea. Why don't you stay with me for a few days and go on the next ship? Get in! Let me go! Let me go! Stop him now! - Stand still! - Stand still! - Freeze! - Hands up! - Stay right there! - Hands up! - Stand still! - Go, quickly! - Hurry up. - Hurry up. Search everywhere. Do not let anyone leave. Copy that. Are you kidding me? Very good. Very good. There are no girls left. Let's go! Sister. Stop! Please forgive me. I'm here! I escaped! Look out! No. I said that... love makes me strong. Do you remember? Who threw the rock at me? How can a statue throw a rock? Boxer Trinh, although his legs are not strong, his arms can fight 100 people. Beat his leg! Dammit! I was so busy that I almost forgot my Mong Nga. Teo! Teo! It's Teo! It's Teo. God! What are you doing? After overcoming many obstacles, Van Tien and Nguyet Nga finally found a happy ending. Their story inspired me to finish this painting.
