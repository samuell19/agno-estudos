WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDRES LAPETEUS? Andres Lapeteus: EINARI KOPPEL. His war fellows: Kaartna: ITA EVER. Põdrus: HEINO MANDRI. Roogas: UNO LOIT. Pajuviidik: KALJU KIISK. Haavik: REIN AREN. WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDRES LAPETEUS? Reet Lapeteus: ADA LUNDVER. Jürven: ANTS ESKOLA. Muruk: OLEV ESKOLA. Sammelselg: HARRI TIIDUS. Uncle: ELMAR KIVILOO. WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDRES LAPETEUS? I'm listening. I beg your pardon? Say again, please. Volga 73-98 was driven by Andres Lapeteus, son of Ado. Moskvitch 91-02 was driven by Viktor Haavik, son of Peeter. He had a passenger - Reet Lapeteus, daughter of Johannes. We've have determined that she is the wife of the driver of the Volga. How are they? - Citizen Haavik died instantly. The Lapeteuses are in the hospital. The accident was caused by the Volga. A weird coincidence: the husband in one car, his wife in the other. I'm very glad you came. Really glad. We haven't seen each other since you left Viljandi. That's seven years. Come on in. Hello. - Pajuviidik, you haven't aged a bit. Oh, you just wait till Kaartna arrives. Kaartna is not coming. - Why? She asked me to tell you that she can't come. Eh, guys, I'm so unlucky. I only came here because of Helvi. I have secretly loved her and I wanted to tell her that today. Why on earth would I want to just sit and drink here with you guys. Three drinks and you'll be talking about digestion and blood pressure. I talk about radiculitis. Yes, it's a shame Helvi couldn't come. Hey, captain, where's your wife? Are you going to leave us entirely without women today? My wife went to the country, her aunt suddenly fell ill. It was good idea to get us all together. Yes, I'd been meaning to do it, but something always came up. Well, boys... What are we waiting for, eh? Oh yes, Haavik is not here yet. You didn't forget him, did you? I haven't forgotten anyone, my friends. I invited everyone. A-ha! Excuse me. Why did he invite us here? Haavik phoned from Rakvere, an unexpected work assignment. Asked me to give you his regards, said he's thinkging of his comrades. Well, let's take our seats. Was it an accident or something else? Lapeteus was not quite himself last night. I feel kind of guilty. Sure, we chinked glasses, but we did not understand each other. Damn it, life is a hellishly complicated affair. What time did he take you home? - Take? I came on my own two feet, Põdrus stayed there. But I don't think he went to drive Põdrus home at night. No, he was at home when I left at about two in the morning. The accident happened a few minutes after four. Why and where was he driving? It just sounds unbelievable. Does Lapeteus know whom he crashed into? Probably not. He won't be told until the doctors allow it. He couldn't have seen people in the Moskvitch, it happened so fast. After you left, we sat and talked, about the times and the people. He seemed offended. - Yes. He seemed odd. Did we even... know Andres Lapeteus? It should be Kehra soon. - Yes, it will be Kehra soon. Hey, Captain. - Stop it, Viktor, drop the ranks. Don't forget we're demobilised. - You'll always be a captain for me. I like it when stars are no longer the measure of a man. If that should happen to me, I wouldn't know what to do. War is the only thing I've learnt, so I guess it's my calling. I don't believe you. War cannot be a calling, least of all for you. The army has been my workplace and home. Hey, Captain, do you know where you'll be assigned to work? There's tonnes of work. - Yes. There sure isk. The whole country has to be rebuilt. But who will do it? It'll be us, the guards officers. And feels damn great. One thing's certain: wherever we go, we'll have friends from the war. The men we've shared ammunition with are now ministers, directors. You'll be a city or county committee secretary. - What job would you like? I'll go anyplace where the Soviet government needs me. What is your calling? I know what isn't my calling, but I don't know what is. I know your calling. - Well? - You want to be staff. Leadership. What's wrong with that? We're all staff. You too, Pajuviidik and Helvi. I'm not staff. I'm a weaver. Before the war, I worked at Iron Yarn and I think I'll go back there. Formerly a weaver, now the director of the Red Iron Yarn. Hey, I'll be up for some stockings. - You wear socks. No stockings. - An awful sin, forgetting about your fellows. We should never forget the friendship forged in war. You speak true, Viktor. Friends made in war will be friends forever. Let me carry your case. - No, thanks, it's not heavy, almost empty. I beg your pardon. Beautiful weather. Tallinn is smiling to us. It's lucky Toompea was left intact. You should let me carry your case. - No, it's really not heavy. Farewell. - When will we see again? I don't know. I really don't. Yes... I'll find you in a few days, if that's alright with you. I don't know either where I'll be assigned to. Let me see you home. - No, that's not necessary. Please let me. - Not necessary. Good bye. The awful cold look in your eyes, when you put on a smile. From your cold eys I can see that you're not true to me. The awful cold look in your eyes, although you're pretending to smile. Although you're pretending to smile. Cheer up, guys! Cheers. Where is Helvi? - I don't know. I'll go and dance. Why aren't you dancing. You've grown terribly gloomy recently. You know, Põdrus, my wife ran off with the Germans. She's supposedly in Sweden. - That's why... We got married a year before the war. Sometimes we have to be stronger than our feelings. I don't want to go home. Silent walls and dusty furniture. If she didn't care about her homeland and me, to hell with her. You know that they demoralised many with horror stories. We were declared dead. Well, my friends. May she be happy. - Let's drink to all the hardship we've left behind and to the victory we won and all the good new things to come. Cheers. My apartment in Tallinn will be free. You could have it. You'll probably need more space soon. - No, thank you. The premises I have are quite sufficient for me. I apologise. I thought that... - You'd be marrying Helvi. Andres is not the first man to fall in love, burn, and cool down. Do you really think that army women would make good wives and mothers? You're blind. Or just an ordinary jerk. Helvi is history for me, just like the war is history. Good day. - Good day. You've worked in forestry. - Yes, 2 years in Saarevere forest district. First as a feller, then in the office. And as a substitute quality inspector. What would you say if the party assigned you to the Forestry Ministry? I'm not really at home in forestry. - What are you at home in? I lack a professional qualification. - Foresty needs trustworthy people. The composition of staff is of utmost importance. All sorts of rabble are now working in forestry. There are former constables and even cutthroats from the former police battalions. We wouldn't be assigning you to an easy job, comrade Lapeteus. I'm not sure I can fulfil the task. - You'll learn, you'll be taught. We'll help and supervise. So, are we agreed? By the way, you served together with comrade Põdrus? Yes, he was the assistant political commander of our battalion. How did the men like him? - Very well, he was a good comissary. Very good. I wish you luck in your new job. Excuse me, comrade Lapeteus, are you married? No, comrade Jürven. Has my husband been here? - Calm down, you can't have visitors. Call him, he's comrade Lapeteus. Head of People's Products Combinate. Tell him I'm alright. The phone numbers are... Don't worry. We'll do all that's needed. - Thank you. Can you tell me about Haavik, the man I was in the car with... He was not brought to our hospital. When my husband comes, please let him see me. No, you misunderstand me. I was protecting Roogas. Haavik! What's happened to Haavik? We're surrounded. We should get out of here. Have you got any tobacco? - What? Here, roll a fag. See if there are any rifles lying about. Comrade Comissary, we should retreat. - We have nowhere to retreat. Comrade 2nd Lieutenant told us to save ammunition. Take care of the Captain first, I'll manage. Stay calm, nurses will be here in a second. Nurses, hurry! Hello. Hello. This is room number 12? - Yes. Yes, I invited you. - Oh, I see. So this is were you work now? - As you see, I'm an instructor. I was transferred from the factory. - I see, I see. Please take a seat. - Thank you. It's a beautiful day outside. I hurried, the Party's orders. Forgive me for inviting you here, but I had no one else to turn to. The matter concerns our war fellow, Roogas. He needs work. Roogas? He stayed in the army. - He was demobilised a year ago. Everyone said he was a good officer. - True, military life suited him. From the army, he went to work as a physical education teacher. He recently left the job, because Jürven demanded his removal. Why? - Apparently a misunderstanding. I am categorically against people like Roogas raising our youth. He served in the bourgeois army. His wife in Sweden or Canada. Comrade Roogas lives in Estonia. He fought for the Soviet rule. He became a Red Army major. The Soviet youth must be raised by people of impeccable reputation. We must be vigilant and ban schools for people imbued with old ideology. Comrade Jürven, we mustn't exclude good people for just vigilance. Comrade Jürven, your final opinion? The Party tells us of the class war. My opinion remains unchanged. Did Jürven tell you to talk to me? - No. He doesn't know Roogas, we do. I understand that acquaintances matter, but... You were brought to the field hospital on the same sledge. Sorry, I bothered you. Yes, you're right. We need people in Viljandi, send Roogas to me. You came as an official? - Põdrus and Pajuviidik send their regards. I asked them not to let anyone in to see me. Don't make your situation worse than it already is. Would you like to tell me how that accident happened? My fault. - You were speeding? I don't know, I didn't look at the speedometer. You were driving from Pirita towards Tallinn. Where did you go? Is it important? - It is. I went to Pirita. Your time is up. What of those whom I hit? - Comrade Major, enough. - Tell me! One was injured, the other was killed. The driver was killed. Well. What concerns me the most is the patient's despondent mood. Do you think he could have seen whom he hit? I would also like to know. It is a very important aspect. It's as if he doesn't want to get better. Reet Lapeteus is in this ward. Thank you. I don't blame my husband. And if Haavik could talk... Haavik was a friend of Andres. It's a pity he can't defend Andres. - Excuse me for asking, but where were you going that night? - You can ask me anything. I was on my way to a friend from school, she lives at Pirita. We'd agreed with Andres that I would spend the night at her place. And then I accidentally met comrade Haavik at the taxi stop. He drove by in his Moskvitch, said he came from work in Rakvere and agreed to take me to Pirita. It's hard to get a taxi at night. - Thank you, that's all. Get better soon. - Hold on a moment. I have to confess something. I asked Andres to lie to you that night. I didn't want to meet Helvi Kaartna and therefore I couldn't stay at home. Please understand, I couldn't force my heart. I sometimes feel as if Andres still loves her. Oh, why did I not stay at home? What awaits Andres now? Hello there. - Hello, comrade Lapeteus. Where is Lapeteus? - Hello, may I come in? Comrade Lapeteus, 18 minutes... - I'm coming straight from Lassiaru. How are they doing? - Good, their plan is full. Only half at Rägavere. Of course, with woods full of former defence league soldiers, cutthroats. To change, we must remove the old, appoint the new. I need your consent. Going back tomorrow. - What about the report? The assistant can write it. I need to get work done in the forest. Alright, we'll talk later. Let's continue work now. Oh, it's good that you're here... I'll try and get it done today. - I'll see you at 10 in the morning. Comrade Lapeteus? - Yes, what is it? Do you know what you are? You're completely bonkers. Oh. - Yes, we're all wondering how you can work and learn like this. There's nothing to wonder there, I simply want to keep up to date. Yes, but not everyone can do it. You are a man of steel. People like you can move mountains. - You're exaggerating. Mountains are not my speciality. I'd rather handle the forests. Is the forest really that dear to you? - Of course it is. Must be. That's good. My friends, I'd have invited you over, but my place is small. Plus there's no lady in the house to take care of us. - Yeah. You were stupid not to marry Helvi. Yes, perhaps. But we remained friends. We recently arranged... Oskar knows - the appointment of Major Roogas. I've been wanting to ask: why was Roogas demobilised? None of us can explain that. I took him under my wing, it's better for him in Viljandi. Well, friends, let's drink to him. - Cheers. You, Captain, are a Guards officer through and through. I don't get it how those people think who remove men like Roogas. Well, his history... - History... What tools do these anointed people use to weigh men? I guess those who have been given the scales know what they're doing. You think when God gives you a job, he also gives you the brains, yes? You, Pajuviidik seem to divide the world into two: superiors or dimwits, and subordinates or smart cookies. No, it's not quite like that. The percentage of imbeciles is about equal among both. The idiocy of the bosses is just more visible than that of the flunkies. Viktor, am I babbling nonsense again? - No, absolute sweet wisdom, Salomon. But talk like this won't get you far. - But you'll make it far. You string words together so well... - This is no place for talk like that. I think this is just the place. If we only talk of socialism on a speech pedestal, and elsewhere just think of kopecks, vodka and big tits, we'll see the new life as much as we see our ears. Why can't we talk about our life goals here, among friends? You know what, comrades, great ideas are not for joking about. You oppose the use of Marxist-Leninist classics? - You've been misinformed. I only said a citation in itself is not an argument. You don't think the viewpoints of Marxist classics are arguments? Põdrus. Hello. - Hello. You're here as well? - I was called for some reason. How are you doing? - Getting by. What happened? - Ah, nothing. You must go in. May I? - Please, come in. Is someone named Roogas working in your system? Yes, in Viljandi. You know who he is? Roogas... served in our division. He was injured, got two medals. Comrade Lapeteus, do you not see he's an officer of the bourgeois army? That his wife lives abroad? And you defend him, just like comrade Põdrus. Comrade Põdrus knows people well. - But you know people poorly. Haven't you wondered why the Germans did not shoot Põdrus' parents? My parents weren't killed either. - You were one of thousands. Põdrus was a well-known man, the kin of such were watched, killed. His parents stayed happily alive. - The Germans couldn't shoot everyone. The fascists murdered 120,00 people in Estonia. Don't forget that. That's the first thing. And the second thing: don't think I wish that Põdrus' parents were dead, but in evaluating a person we must not omit anything, not even the tiniest factors, may the person be Põdrus, Roogas or whoever. Very well, let us get to the matter for which I called you here. We want to elect you secretary general of the Ministry's party organisation. Pretty flowers. They're waiting. Would you like me to give them a message? Greetings! Pull through, be strong! Helvi, Põdrus. The situation in our schools is far from good. Many teachers still carry the old spirit, but education leaders like comrade Põdrus refuse to see it. Instead, he sends a bourgeois army officer to us as a teacher and that makes the situation even worse. We must talk about things using their real names. Põdrus protects the bourgeois element, he has become their loyal servant. We've talked of the flawed work style of the Head of Education Department. I don't want to reiterate. I would ony like to add that he banned consistution teachers from using quotes from Marxist classics. Comrades, participants have pointed out to the committee that one of the audience is constantly writing something. It is our well-known friend Põdrus. What is he writing? The committee thinks the vigilance towards a man like Põdrus - I struggle to call him a comrade - is never excessive. It is proposed that Põdrus bring his notebook here and leave the meeting. No otherp proposals? Let's vote. Who is in favour of revoking Põdrus' right to attend the meeting? Who is against? A tiny minority. The committee's proposal is approved. Põdrus, please bring your notebook here and leave the meeting. Recess, 15 minutes. Hello, did my boss not come downstairs? - No. I don't even properly know him. Asked for data for his presentation and has now just disappeared. See you. What shall we order? - I'll only have coffee. Coffee's crap here, let's have lunch. - I don't understand Jürven. I thought there is nothing worse than the war. Have at least a couple of sandwiches. You've become so skinny. - No, I'll just have coffee. And a cake, if I really look that skinny. We'll have a drink as well, yes? Who knows, perhaps Jürven is right about some things. We'll order some cognac, yes? - No, I would get drunk. What can I get you? - So we're agreed? Two cakes - you're that skinny - two coffees and 200g of cognac. If you don't want any, I'll drink it all myself. I'm grateful to you. I'm going to leave if you talk like this. I apologise. I don't understand a thing anymore. No, maybe I understand a few things. Perhaps I have really made a mistake somewhere. And it is right to criticise it, but... - I don't understand you. You're being treated as an enemy and you approve of it all. You know what's bothering me the most? I have new friends. People who publicly showed me their teeth now show their sympathy. Do they really think I'm their ally? That would be terrible. - I'm afraid of something entirely different. I'm afraid that after what's happened you won't trust anyone anymore. Not even yourself. That is even more terrible. Perhaps you're right. I am rather confused. But why did they drive me out like a leper? No one understands that. Not even those who raised their hand in favour of Jürven's proposal. I'm so glad you came with me. I haven't lost faith, Madis Jürven is not the entire Party. Pour me some cognac. It is unimportant that I came. One of us always comes in hardship. You work too hard, Captain. Studying and studying. You'll soon burn through. - It's alright, I can handle it. I saw Põdrus a few days ago. At a cafe with Helvi Kaartna. I accidentally heard what they were saying. Our comissary is a weird man. Põdrus is having a hard time. - Perhaps. For Helvi though, he seems to be your replacement. Don't talk of Helvi like that to me. - Apologies. You'll always be a man of honour, but their words enraged me. They were not happy with anything, kept criticising everything. Jürven is right. I'm see now how the class struggle is intensifying in our republic. I also want to join the Party now. Will you give me a letter of reference? Me as a former frontline man... - Jürven is right. Põdrus should not blame others, he should blame himself. Blood. Where are the mats? - In the cellar. I scrubbed, but the blood won't go. Is he going to survive? As a cripple. - Will he even get a pension. You now take care of him. You lived like a cat and a dog. Divorce him. If I divorced now, everyone would blame me. - They'd soon forget. Andres has ruined your whole life, made you unhappy. - Leave me alone. He never became a minister. - Shut up for once! You were sleeping with Haavik, Andres knew about it. - That's a lie. That's a lie! Do you understand? It's all my fault. I should have stayed at home. You were right, we must go our separate ways. - Don't talk like that. Try to understand me. And forgive me. I've nothing to forgive you for. Why did you come here? I talked to the doctor. Your condition is far from hopeless. I also consulted a lawyer. Nothing severe awaits you. We agreed that attorney-at-law Debin will be your defence. Now you're being who you are. Come and celebrate our new house. - I'm going to Võru. Don't go. Or go a day later. I can't, I have to go. Send your assistant. He stinks of ink anyway. I have no love for this desk here. I understand, you find it stifling. Excuse me. Yes, I'm listening. No, I don't support your proposal, the solution is only partial. The minister agrees? Why are you talking to me then. No, I will keep to my opinion also on the panel. Goodbye. Telephones - my great enemies. You yourself are your own greatest enemy. See that? An enemy overcome. Goodbye. We shall be expecting you. Yes, come in. May I? - Good day, come on in. Have a seat. I came to say that I'm leaving my job. That's news. Why? Do sit down. I don't want to be fired. Or you to be reproached because of me. What has happened? Among other suspicious people whom Põdrus allegedly favoured, the city paper listed my name. It has caught attention in Viljandi. - Yes, the times are difficult. Have you properly considered this? The ministry hasn't raised your issue. I have. I can't work if people don't trust me. Yes, of course, I don't want to force you, but... Think about it again and do what you think is right. Don't forget that I support you. We fought together at the frontline. Thank you again. I honestly admit I liked the job. But there's nothing to be done. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes, I can no longer protect him. Hello. - Hello. Shall we go and sit somewhere? - I'd rather walk. Did you think everything will come by itself? That there'll be no rocks on your path after the war? I understand why I'm being mistrusted. But why do they persecute you? Let us not look at life from our own low hill. In the war, you were the battalion comissary. And I was a communist. But now we're both 'suspicious element'. I don't believe you've suddenly become the tool of the bourgeoise. What can I tell you? I cannot consent to you being considered suspicious element. Would you give me a letter of reference to join the Party? I didn't mean it seriously. I still retain a certain sense of reality. I would, of course, but my recommendations have no power now. The day before yesterday, I was expelled from the Party. I'm sorry. The most important thing is for us to always feel like communists and to act as communists in every situation. I'm glad you came. - I was told to postpone my trip. You don't dance? - No, thank you, I... It is so good to see a leading Soviet worker in our modest company. Here's to you. I cannot eat liver and fat. They cause sclerosis, for they contain cholesterine. I shouldn't really drink alcohol, but oh well, who cares. Cheers. Macaroni! It is unbelievable how much an Estonian can accomplish. He can literally create something out of nothing. If he's left be. Even the house we're now partying in is confirmation of my words. A toast to you, comrade Lapeteus. Comrade Lapeteus. Do you want to leave? This is not why I invited you. To hell with it all! You moron, what did you come here for? Comrade Captain, permission to talk, sir. Sgt Pajuviidik of 2nd PL of 5th Co, awarded Order of Glory, three medals, qualified brickmason, union member, humble newspaper reader. - At ease. Do you have a cigarette? - Yes, I do. - Be at ease. I saw from afar, a familiar figure. Warmed my heart right away. A guy from my own company! I drank with such poopheads tonight that I'd like to take a shit now. I wouldn't have expected to see the minister's right hand man nodding off on a train platform where all the smaller folk bustle about. Have they scorched you out? It's the days of terrible scorching. Everywhere is full of thick smoke. Where did you get this pissed? Hey, explain something to me. Why are you guys flogging each other so furiously? Removals from jobs and expulsions from Party ranks. The anti-people element is being rooted out, that's all. You're as if reading from the paper. Speak like a human. You're drunk. Come and talk when you're sober. Don't insult a soldier. I was injured twice just like you. I ask you like a brother from a brother, but you... Ah, fuck it. Let's sing something instead, eh? Do you remember? Let us smoke, boys, let us smoke... Oh, alright, I'll stop singing. A song could mar a minister's man, plus you can't keep a tune. Have you got any vodka? - No, I haven't. - I have. Let's drink to those who never returned from Velikiye Luki. We had a strong company. Don't embarrass your company. I guess I'll head off on foot. You coming? Andres. Where were you when they labelled Põdrus an enemy of the people? Põdrus... Damn it, we all know him. Did you put in a good word for him? Or was your mouth full of water? - Keep it down, my friend. Oh, guards officers... You have to shout, Captain. But you - you didn't even squeak. Comrade Lapeteus, may I offer you a cup of coffee? I always make coffee when I'm on duty. Here you are. - Thank you. You're still sitting here and working till midnight? I must apologise. That night... - There's nothing to apologise for. We were truly glad you could come, and sorry you left early. The coffee is superb. Well, I won't keep you any longer, I'll get back to my telephones. And should you want more coffee, I've got a full pot. Why won't you have a seat? Let's drink to your new position. I don't understand you, Andres. You're the Deputy Head of the Oblast Executive Committee and still unhappy. Reet, you're just playing with me. And to you not doing all the work, but giving some to your subordinates. No, you are wonderful. How reckless you are. I waited for this just like you, but I didn't want to be your lover. I wanted you for good. Or don't you like me anymore? I like you more and more. It's odd that our dreams never come true. It's a shame you're not allowed to go to church. Imagine us: you in a tailcoat, me in a white wedding gown. The church is lit up, the organ is playing bridemaids and bridegrooms behind us, twelve pairs of them. Oh well, you're a Party member and can't set your foot in a church. But I do want a grand wedding. And you'll wear a tailcoat, yes? Can you wear a tailcoat? - No, no tailcoats, no tuxedos. I can wear a black suit, but only on national holidays. Oh, don't joke about it, darling, that's terrible. Such a beautiful moment in a woman's life rendered so banal. I've always argued that Bolshevism does not mean people are a mass. Your new personal salary proves that Soviet people are all individuals. But you're still banal. Squeeze me, squeeze me tighter. You could probably have raped me. Why didn't you try? Let me go, you're crazy. You're crazy, we don't have time. We can start leaving later only when you get a car. Two tickets, please. You'll get a bad husband who'll stay at work late or go on work trips. Reconsider before it's too late. - No. You'll get a bad wife who won't share you with work and trips. At least until she's bored with her big iron boy. Invite the Head of Oblast Executive Committee to the wedding. Don't look at me like this. We're in a tram, not in bed. You talk about the wedding, but I haven't even said I love you. If you don't want, we won't have a wedding. We'll get the marriage registered, buy a bottle of vodka and go to sleep. You are wonderful. I admire you. What should I do? Cry? Would it be better if I cried? Do you love Andres? - He is my husband. How's his condition now? - Poor, very poor. He looks like a corpse. Perhaps it would be better for him if he died. I think the peak of my life is past. I'm not interested in anything anymore. Do you think they'll expel him from the Party? They protect their own. Andres will get off lightly. I'll got to the Regional Committee tomorrow. The oddest thing is he doesn't want to get off lightly. Yes, definitely go, talk to Jürven. Good day. - Good day. I need to speak to cormade Jürven. - He no longer works here. How so? Who's replaced him? - Comrade Kaartna. Kaartna? - Please come on in, she's free. You are comrade Helvi Kaartna? And you are comrade... - Comrade Lapeteus' wife. Tell me how your husband is doing. - He is dying. No, no. The doctors are convinced he'll recover. Please, take a seat. I can't stand to watch how he suffers and reproaches himself. For him, work is the most important thing. Work and the Party. You knew him, didn't you? What awaits him? Did your husband send you here? - No. He must not know i was here. And how could I help you? I'm sorry. I don't even know why I came here. Calm down, you're upset. Sit down and we'll talk. I actually wanted to talk to comrade Jürven. Good day. There are some among us who refuse to see that the class struggle exists. You all know who Põdrus is. But one of our instructors does what? Still talks to a people's enemy. I'm referring to you, comrade Kaartna. Do you have anything to say? Why are you scaring us? Why are you always threatening? - You oppose to the Party? I said on the panel I don't think Põdrus is a tool of the class enemy. Comrade Kaartna, we must trust the Party more than ourselves. The Party has always taught me to be honest. - Honest? Quite right. Tell me, have you met with Põdrus or not. - Yes, I have. For what purpose? Answer, your comrades are waiting. - I won't answer your questions. I'll answer to everyone else here. But not you. Yes, take care of the matter. Hello. - Hello. Haven't seen you for a few of years. - Yes, two years. I'd love to chat with you, but a meeting is about to start. If you ever have time, pop by. My office is one floor up. I'm sorry, but I have to go now. Hello, boss. May I come in? - Please do. Stop messing around, come on in. Isn't this a grand command station. Until now, I've never understood why we needed the oblasts. Our republic is smaller than some reasonable oblasts. They were created to bring leadership closer to people. - Very good. Well, step closer to people then. Hello. What brings you here? Come and visit our construction site. You should know what chaos we have. Really makes me mad. The design gets changed 10 times, we keep demolishing things and... Please get me a line to comrade Malts. Go on, I'm listening. - They're throwing away time and money. A load of cement goes to the site, another goes to a private dwelling. Did we fight for some speculants to erect private castles? Malts? I didn't find your reports on my desk, send them immediately. I hope I don't have to remind you about things like this again. Have you got any facts? - Are these not facts? Send your people and come yourself, talk to the working people. Otherwise they sit in offices and talk all the facts straight. You sound like... - Like a class enemy. Should an honest worker whose soul cries for sloppiness and stupidity shout Hallelujah to everything? - Sorry, ten areas, tens of meetings. Well, I haven't much else to say. - You may be right about a few things. Yes, apparently we need to delve deeper into construction problems. I'll come and see you, definitely. Farewell. Comrade Kaartna, the director asked to see you. - I'll be right there. Rushing at the end of months tells of grave problems in work organisation. We must ensure that the operation of every workshop and plant is rhytmical and strictly organised. Hello. - Hello. I didn't know you work here. - Yes, I work here again. Comrade Kaartna is our partorg. - Yes, you have a good factory. Our factory is great. - Time flies by, you seldom meet old friends. Roogas left Viljandi. Beats me why. Haavik is doing well, workign as a deputy editor-in-chief. Põdrus was unlucky, but it's largely his own fault. Põdrus has remained a communist. He has always been one. I'm not so sure about it anymore. - You're serious? - Yes. I don't believe you. Comrade Lapeteus, a call from the Central Committee. - Thank you. Yes, Lapeteus speaking. Alright, I'll be right there. Comrades, the meeting is cancelled. Hello. Where are you working now? When the oblasts were abolished, I was appointed combinate director. By the way, look at that man over there. He once asked me why your parents weren't shot. - What did you say? I told him my parents weren't shot either. I must salute you. I must admit he confused me back then. - Well, yes... I've been wanting to ask you something. - Yes? Tell, when I was thrown out of that meeting... were you really looking for your boss? Yes, I recall. The minister did actually ask me for data. It's time to go back in. - Yes. Long live! Twice long live! Three times long live! Hurray! To the beautiful lady of the house, may she have a lot of happiness. Plant oil is the most efficient tool against sclerosis. Stay away from meat and butter and prefer olive and sunflower oil. People here have more cardiovascular diseases than in Ryazan and Astrakhan. True, how very true... - Excuse me, let me tell you more. Butter, meat and fat mean strokes and infarctions. But the medics forget what it does to the nerves of average Estonians. One rule comes, another goes. One slope begins, another ends. Nothing permanent or secure. What does that do to the nerves? To people's nerves? It's easy to blame pork and butter... - Let's not talk of gloomy things. To the beautiful lady of the house. No, thank you, no. - No, have some. Thank you. They're starting to take down monuments. Honestly, monuments. Stop it. Stop this guffaw! No, what I said is not crap. You really need to prepare the body for digestion, rest and... Resting, eating, drinking, sleeping... You forgot work, the most important thing! - Yes, well... What about work? What's wrong with Andres? - A man of iron. To hell with it all. - What did you say? Andres is a bit odd tonight. - Wish it was only tonight. It's very difficult for me. I can tell you, you're his friend. - I'm also having trouble reading him. What on earth is he lacking? I would like to be in his shoes. Just you would be enough for me. Andres, come with me, let's go. Yes, go on. You know, Viktor, I'm fed up with everyone, you as well. For you, socialism is a woman's bare bottom. Go to hell! Goodbye! Come on now. Went to play everywhere, everywhere... Arrivederci, senora! Reet. You've lost your mind. - You can't live with Andres, I without you. Get undressed. You must leave soon, Andres gets up at six. I invited my wartime friends over for Sunday. Who? - Põdrus and Roogas, Pajuviidik... You know Haavik... and Kaartna. Why them? - I'm fed up with your speculant and kulak mates. You can invite just your Helvi, why the others? - What does that mean? You think I don't know you lived with her three years, expected to marry? Yes, invite them. I won't tell anyone. You destroy everything beautiful between us. If you think there's nothing between us, we can divorce. You can live upstairs until you find an apartment. So you've found your minister? - How petty you are. Petty, petty. I was wrong about you. Wrong, do you hear me? It's good they keep a soldier like you even in your current job. Heavens, how could I have been so blind? Thank god I haven't had a child with you. Please come in, make yourself at home. Welcome. Go on. Yes, fine work. They don't make it like this anymore. - The house is ten years old. Just like in the movies. My wife wants everything to be very modern. Do you feel comfortable here? Excuse me. We'll have cigars later, with the cognac. I'm very glad you came. Really glad. We haven't seen each other since you left Viljandi. That's seven years. Come on in. Hello. - Pajuviidik, you haven't aged a bit. Oh, you just wait till Helvi Kaartna arrives. - Kaartna is not coming. Guys, do you remember that night before the attack on Velikiye Luki? It was cold. But we couldn't make a fire - rocks don't burn and we had no wood. Captain, it's maybe impolite, but not asking would be dishonest. Why did you want to see us tonight? What's wrong with wanting to see one's wartime friends? Do you remember, how you once said that friends made in war will be friends for life? Do you remember, Captain? I've never forgotten those words. You forgot. You forgot, Captain. When Põdrus and Roogas had it rough, you did everything you could to stop their problems from disturbing your life and mood. I won't even mention Helvi. - Are you all thinking that? We've grown apart, Oskar. It's a shame. At least I think it is. I sometimes feel so utterly lonely. And old buddies now accuse me. - Grown apart? You're right about that. No one feels a particular hatred against you. But no fondness either. That's why everyone rushed to leave. - I considered you as my friends. Time showed that our friendship was superficial. Time... Time was rough. Every one of us bears it marks. It didn't pass anyone by untouched, neither me nor you. Cult of personality was not about one person being declared right. Cult of personality created a way of thought, dogmatism. Everyone expected directives from above. Did you ask me to stay to explain the cult of personality to me? Please understand, Oskar, it's hard for activists like me now. People point fingers: see those bootlickers, those situation actors. Everyone else was sensible, only they were struck with blindness. I do understand, but... - I didn't. And those who now say they just went with the flow, are actually true situation actors. I can't stand those who now whine in self-pity: "Oh the hard times!" Still, thousands were in prisons or deported. You were beaten. Yes, beaten, you're right about that. Many were beaten, oppressed, physically destroyed. But we must look at the times past as they were. Joy was not unknown to us. No nation achieved the results we did in those years. And when I talk of whiners, I mean people like you, who never sat in jail, but now act as the biggest victims of the era. You mean to insult me? - Whining doesn't cost anything. It was a painful lesson for us all. And we must draw our conclusions. And one of the conclusions is: don't moan, don't whine. All that you did, you did yourself, now take responsibility. And we must take responsibility, we must make things better. Not go begging for sympathy. No one pities us. Think with your own head. Think and act. Think, act and be responsible. - I don't owe anything to anyone. Perhaps only Helvi. Do you love your wife? You're not being very tactful. - No, I'm asking that for a reason. Helvi and me are getting married. To your happiness. - Thank you. To hell with it all! You forgot, Captain. Don't whine, all that you did, you did yourself. No, don't see me home. It's not necessary. Goodbye. Where are we going? - Pirita. I told Andres I'd stay the night there. WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDRES LAPETEUS? Screenwriter: PAUL KUUSBERG. Director: GRIGORI KROMANOV.
