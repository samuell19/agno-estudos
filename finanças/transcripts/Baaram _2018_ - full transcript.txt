(Babble of voices) - How much for the balloon? - Ten rupees. Which one? Balloon vendors don't stand middle of road Move way - How much for this one? - Fifty rupees. - This one? - No, thanks. (Folk song) Rajan, how're you? I seeing every things I'll see if I can find it. - Brother! - Hi! Alright, I had to come here. (Folk song) - How much? - Fifty rupees. Fifty rupees! What unfair? But it's just 4 holes! 50's too much. Give it to me for ten. Your face has holes in it! Ten rupees! Get lost! (Babble of voices) Hello, sir. Hello! Here, take some. What brings you here? Come, uncle. - Come in, brother. - Coming ma. - Here, darling. - She's just stuffed her face! - Want to drink water? - Bring it. I will bring it. Hi uncle What a crowd at the festival! You didn't come? How is now? It used to be exciting when we were young. I made dry fish curry and rice. - Bring it. - I will bring it. Study, child. Remember those flutes we used to buy at the fair for 50 paise? Do you want to play with toys at this age? Will a toy flute scare away a thief? It's not for me, silly! Come, come, Mani. Didn't you set up the stall today? The new beat cop came. Why? Dry fish curry. We have to pay 500 rupees a night after 8 pm. And what's left for us? - Sweetheart! - Veera! Hey Uncle! - Come...come - Mother - Come, eat. - I will eat ma. - Uncle... - Come, Veera. Special feast? Was yesterday they told like that? It was aunt's death anniversary 3 days ago? You didn't tell me? It happens every year, son. I came for my Aadhar card. Mani! So how much is that flute for? Never mind. This fish curry's delicious. I'll have some more. Veera, come sit. Here. What is it? Guavas! Where did you get so many from? They're from Vellaisaamy's garden. He gave them to me. That old miser only has a soft spot for you. Yesterday, I was planning to visit you at work. But you came. You wouldn't have found me if you'd come. Why not? I quit my job. Quit your job? What's he saying? Are you insane? It's a government job with a pension. You're not married yet. And you've quit your job! Do you know how many people I had to beg to get you that job? I thought I'd join the union full-time. Really? That's okay, too. What's the use of being a government bus conductor? See you. Bring me some water. Veera, wait. - He never stand here. - Come...come, Uncle Drive safe! Go carefully, uncle. Why did he quit his job? Veera! Lend me 20 rupees. I'll return it when I'm paid. Is that what you've been trying to ask? No, no. just 20. Keep it. I'll remind you if you forget. It's Senthil's daughter's birthday. How time flies! She's 9 now. So I thought I'd buy her a flute. It's tomorrow? Fine Uncle. Don't get me wrong. You're old now. Why are you still doing this watchman's job? There's the 3 of us. Or you can move to Senthil's. Why are you struggling? Only moths fall into the flame. I'm a firefly. You never listen. Come, I'll drop you off. Why, don't you like to see me in one piece? I'll walk. (Kids playing) 'The Burden' Run, run! Mister - Careful - What happened? Give him some water. My hip! Watch his hip! - Let's go that way. - Easy, easy. He is here only working. - Where does he work? - Here. Lift him, bro, he's heavy Brother Gently. Lie down carefully. Brother. Who's it at this hour? Sorry to bother you. He's the colony watchman. A motorcyclist hit him. My home's too far away. We didn't know what to do. - Has he given you his address? - No. He's not talking. He only said his hip hurts. Is this really an accident? Yes. We saw it. We'll get in trouble. - Have you packed her lunch? - Yes. - ‘Bye, ma! - You better come straight home. No stopping to play with your friends! Bye grandma. Take the container. Bring the bag. ‘Bye, ma. ‘Bye, sweetie. Oh God! Tell me. I sent the cash yesterday but he's still asking us to close early. Muruga... One second, ma. Hey Muruga... - Listen to me! - One second, ma! Your uncle hasn't returned from work yet. I'll call you back. It's 1 o'clock. He can't bear to stay hungry. Ma, he always comes straight home from work. He must have stopped to chat with someone. You're crying over this? He's never done this before. He'd at least call. Tell me, Muruga. He's not back yet? He said yesterday that he was going to Senthil's house. It's his daughter's birthday today. Maybe he's gone there. Okay. I told you, ma, he's gone to Senthil's house. Call Senthil, son You know Senthil can't stand me, and you still want me to call him? He is such a nuisance - I'll dial. Will you speak? - No, no, you do it. Sir... Are you feeling better? Can you talk? How's your hip? Sir... Try to talk. Should we go to the cops? No, it'll become a problem. They'll turn around and accuse us. Forget it. Sir! Can you remember anything? Can you hear me? Please try. You're fine. How long will we keep him here? Who'll be responsible if something happens to him? Keep quiet! It's getting too messy. He's conscious! Sir! My hip hurts. Don't worry, we'll go to the hospital. Is there anyone we can call? A phone number? Such arrogance! Does it hurt you to make one phone call? Alright, ma, I'll call Senthil. Don't yell. Where's the knife? Check near the grinder. Who's this? Yes, speaking. Yes, he's my uncle. - When? - What happened? Where? What? What happened? Okay, we're coming. Ma, uncle's had an accident. Mani! I told you. Did you listen? What happened? Call Pachai! Uncle's had an accident! Ask for the tempo. I knew something was wrong! What happened? The protest will last 10 days. Saiyesh, how many have you called? I've spoken to 30-35 people But only 10-15 will come. They laugh when I ask. We need to explain why we're protesting. Retirement benefits have been withdrawn. What will the workers do now? One second. Tell me, Muruga. What? Oh God! - Call Pachai! - Pachai, hurry! Lift him. Oh God! Gently, gently. Mani get down. Mani, lift him! Just bear it. - Did you ask? - Oh God! - Have you checked his BP? - Yes, doctor. Who's with Karuppasamy? The doctor wants to see you. Nothing...nothing Greetings, doctor. - Are you his family? - Yes, sir. Come with me. His hip is shattered. We have to operate. Will he walk again, if we operate? - He's healthy. Is he around 65? - Must be, doctor. If we operate now, he'll live at least another 10 years. - Do we have to operate? - Yes, absolutely. I'll have to check with his son about that. - Who are you, then? - His nephews. Ask him to come at once. Let's go, pa. I'm ready. Call your mother. Ma, let's go. What a pain! Tell me, Muruga. "Your father's had an accident. Come at once." Accident? When? We don't know. We got a call saying he'd had an accident. We've admitted him to Dharani Clinic. Hurry and come. "I'm going out." He needs an operation. You have to come. That's not possible. Bring him here. "To the village?" "How can I bring him from town to the village?" Why, don't we have hospitals here? It'll be cheaper, too. Bring him. Hang up, now. Hey! Hey! Senth- - What's he saying? - He hung up! 1500 rupees! Are you kidding? I do all the work. You're paying so little? If you want more, you find the people. If I do, that's all I'll pay. - Can you help? He's hurt. - Hurry, Mani. My hip hurts. I can't sit. What happened? Accident. Watch his hip. Senthil, I can't bear the pain. - Greetings - Yes come in. It's a fracture. There's no option. You have to operate. An operation will be expensive, doctor. Not really, but otherwise, he'll never walk again. His hip bone is broken. If you see a doctor now, it can be fixed. Can you fix it without operating? No, we don't have the facilities. We can't afford it. But if he can't walk, you'll have to look after him. Consider that, too. We will operate him in that hospital. Why is he unwanted travelling? I can't. Nothing uncle Don't worry. What happened? You took him away this morning, and now you're back. They said we have to operate. I told you that in the morning. Why did you take him away? It's still not too late. Admit him to a specialty hospital. That will be expensive. Who said that? Bring me his residence and income proof papers. We'll insure him under the Chief Minister's Welfare Scheme and the operation will be free. Where will I get those documents? Ask the Revenue Collector's office. - Bring them quickly. - Okay, doctor. Your poor father. Don't drag him around anymore. Go get the papers. We'll handle things here. That side. Little Bear it, uncle. I told him then. Who's listening? - Muruga... - Come, Veera. - Coming from union? - What did the doctor say? He gave tablets for the pain. He took them, and slept. Uncle. Uncle Who is it? Veera? Come. What's all this? Shouldn't you watch where you're going? How's the pain now? Much better, now that you're here. You'll be okay. You're the one who keeps saying, 'I'm not a moth, I'm a firefly.' I'm a firefly alright. Let the operation get done. Then we'll play leapfrog. Let's see who wins. You will, uncle. Where's the doubt? Fine uncle. I've been invited to a protest out of town. A group of us is leaving tonight. - I'll be back soon. - When? I'll be back in 10 days. Your operation will be done by then. I'll be back soon. Rest now. Sleep. Mani, come here. Where's Murugan? He's gone to the shop. No, no, I have money. Take it, for medicines. Keep me posted. I'll call Murugan. Drive carefully. Uncle, will you have some juice? I can't take the pain. I'll ask the doctor for some tablets. - Doctor. - Yes? He's been crying from pain for 2 days. - Does it hurt? - Unbearably, doctor. He's been saying this all night, doctor. I can give him painkillers, but we need to operate. What took so long? Did you get the papers? I thought about it. Doctor? I can't come here every day from the village. So I'm taking him home. Home? He can't even turn! And you want to take him home! What were you doing for 5 days? It's impossible to get those documents. There's a good traditional healer in the village. He says he'll mend the fracture. With what, superglue? If we don't operate now, he'll never walk again. It's your call. Listen to the doctor. I know how to look after my father. Don't teach me. Shut it. Easy, go slow. Stop, Pachai! Mani, pick him up gently. Oh God! - Pachai, take his legs. - Yes, sir. Hold his legs gently. - Get down now. - Will you hold him? Lift him gently. We're home. - In this room? - No, come ahead. - This one? - No, no, come further. - Where, here? - There. Gently...gently Gently mani. Pachai, lay the mat down. Hurry! Lift him from there. Ask pillow. Get me a pillow. Gently. Nothing uncle. Where's the pillow? Nothing to worry. Just lift his head Lie down. Nothing. Take care of yourself. We'll leave now. Could you - Okay, go. - What? - No, nothing. - You were saying something? - Nothing. Okay, look after yourself. I'll be back soon. Okay. Let me know if there's anything else. Senthil. Like we don't have enough trouble. - Why did you bring him here? - What do you want me to do? You should have left him at your aunt's. Why dump him here? They'd take care of him. He gives them all his money. - I'd still have to take care of him. - So? Am I just sitting around? I also go to work, don't I? Now I have to take care of him, too. Senthil. Senthil. We have to pay school fees, buy new books, uniforms. There's gas and light bills. Where's the money? I won't cook for him. I won't clean him up. It's just rice gruel for him. - Shut up! - What should I do? - I'm hungry. - Go away! Nuisance! Senthil. What? Why are you yelling? I can't take the pain, son. Take me to the hospital. I'll have the operation done. - That's not possible. - Why not, son? What do you mean why not? Who has the money for an operation? But that doctor said it's free. Only the operation will be free. I'll have to bribe everyone from the village officer to the ward boy. Such a nuisance Leave me at your aunt's house, then. She'll take care of me. We'll handle all the expenses, too. Is this a game to you? As it is, Murugan can't stand me. Will you humiliate me more by going there? Stay here quietly. Don't pull my leg. At least call Veera. He'll look after me. Don't make me beg, son. Nagamma! One minute. What? What? - My father's bedridden. - So? Will you come and clean him every day? How much will you pay? 25 rupees a day. Who'll do it for 25 rupees? In this day and age, nobody'll work for 25 rupees. Who'll work for 25 rupees? Okay, 35 rupees. Nobody'll come for 35 rupees either. You just have to wipe him down. You can do that yourself. Why ask me? Okay, 45 rupees. No, add 5 and make it 50. No, I can't. I'm busy. Take 45, just come and clean him up. If you add 5 and make it 50, I'll do it, otherwise I'll be on my way. If you want to save 5 rupees, you can do it yourself. Alright, 50 rupees. You should have agreed upfront. He's there. Clean him up. - Who is it? - I've come to clean you up. No. Go away. Let me do it. - No. - Turn. Turn. I have other work. I won't hurt you. Write, child. Tell me, bro. Hang on. Have you fed him? Enough. I'll call you after dinner. - Darshini. - What, ma? Come here. Give it to him. Child Child Come here, child. It's grandpa. See what grandpa bought you For your birthday. Here. No? Why not, child? Look. Do you like it? Here. 3,500 rupees? Come in. This is sudden. I came to see your father. He's lying down. It's so hot! Careful, watch your step. Senthil. Why are you shouting, pa? Menmozhi aunt's here. You're well out of it. Menmozhi! Menmozhi! Oh god! You chat. I'm going to work. Come, sit. Stella, ready? What a state you're in! Come, sit. Is there no place for you in such a big house - What a fate. I'm not blaming anyone. God protect you. What happened to my job? They've paid for the month. Here, use it for fruits and medicines. Don't give it to your son. I'll keep it under your pillow. Why are you so quiet? Is Senthil taking care of you? Very well. Like a king. He's hired a woman to look after me. And yet you're like this? If there's a problem, I'll take care of you. There's no problem. A traditional healer's coming tomorrow. They say he'll fix my hip. Then, you watch. I'll come home, and eat fish curry again. I'll make it for you every day. You get well quickly and come home. Shall I leave now? Could you ask Veera to visit? I'll tell him. He'll take care of me. Look after yourself. Careful with the money. - Tell Veera. - I'll tell him without fail. Okay! - Didn't go to work, Mani? - I'm leaving now. Where did you get the greens from, ma? I get nearby home Come, come, Veera. - Tea? - Yes. Could you make him some tea? Did you go see uncle, ma? I went yesterday. He said he was okay, but I didn't get that feeling. Why? Senthil said they'd operate. He didn't allow it. He took him home, saying he'd hire a traditional healer. I don't know what he's done. Damn! How's he now, ma? I don't know. He won't say what's on his mind, but he can't hide it either. He kept asking for you. Shall I go see him, then? Yeah. Don't talk to Senthil - Yes - Talk to uncle only Why would I? Why's he calling? Who? Tell me, Senthil. I called to tell you Father passed away. What is it? - How? - What is it, son? It was a good death. He went peacefully, in his sleep. - What is it? - The funeral's at 6 pm. Tell your mother. I'll hang up now. - Oh Lord, what will I do now? - What happened? Uncle's dead. What?! When? Your uncle died. How? He says he died in his sleep. I knew he wouldn't I knew he didn't do for him He was fine when I saw him yesterday. What will I do now? You left me My brother, when will I see you again? Where shall I search for you? We were born of the same womb. I saw you just yesterday. You were fine. He was a good man. He taught me how to live, and now he's dead. All of us have to die. But how many die peacefully in their sleep like this? You killed him needlessly. You didn't let him be even 2 days. Grandma, Uncle died in his sleep. No, son, he was killed. Killed? Veera, he murdered him. Shut up, old woman! Keep quiet. Who killed him? That one, there, killed him with a lethal injection. Killed him? Hush, he wasn't well. Uncle, is this true? No, don't make a scene here. Who's making a scene? Hey, who killed my uncle? Keep your voice down. What do you know? Who killed my uncle? Keep quite You don't talk. Who will if I don't? What did you do? Who killed my uncle? He died naturally. She says you killed him. And you believe her? How did he die? Do what you came for, and leave. You don't interfere. One second. What is it? Pay your respects, and leave. He was my uncle! How dare you interfere to this? Senthil! If you killed my uncle - If it's true you killed my uncle, I'll burn this village down! Bugger off! How dare you come here and insult me, you dog! Don't talk without knowledge If I find that was you I will kill you (Lamenting) Granny. - Who is it? - Veera. - When did you arrive? - Just now. Sit. (Calling cattle) Mariakka, come here. - Excuse me. - Who is it? - How are you? - I'm good. You said that Senthil had his father killed. How do you know? The whole village is talking about it. About what? Thalaikoothal. We've done it ourselves. - Really? - Yes About 10 years ago, I came home from work, and found that my wife had done it to my mother. But I don't blame her, because my mother had been sick for a long time. We tried everything. I was thinking of doing it myself, but she did it. When a person's been ill for a long time, the family members call me. I give the person a cold water head bath, and lots of tender coconut water until they get a fever. Within 3 days, they pass away. It's a custom here. - Since when? - Since my grandmother's time. One must live happily. What kind of life is it to be dependent and miserable? How much do you charge? I don't charge. It's a service. It's better to ease their pain and let them go. They mix mud and water into a thick paste. They push that down the throat, and suffocate them. Some people ask to be killed with mud from their own land. It gives peace to their souls. So many ways to kill... They say there are 26 ways. - Really? - Yes. They choke them with hard snacks and sweet buns, feed them milk laced with thorns, pesticides. There are 26 ways to kill. Hundreds of people are killed in our village every year If elders get a headache, they run away from home. I can't work. I have arthritis, so I tend the cattle. Why don't you stay with your son? My son's a struggling daily wage laborer. Rather than die at his hands, I left. They say uncle was killed by lethal injection, right? Who did it? They say a woman who works as support staff in a hospital did it. There's a broker here called Rajan who does this. It's his trade. In Senthil's father's case, they say he used a woman called Meena... to give him a lethal injection. Doesn't anyone go to the cops? Don't they have to come back home? Nobody does it. - Why not? - Complaints won't work. The cops know everything. Nobody's going to talk. The cops will say it's a family matter, and close the case. We just have to accept it. Okay. Okay Thank you very much. Don't repeat what I said about Senthil's father. No I just told you what the villagers are saying. 'To: The Police Superintendent, Srivaipuram, TN Police' 'Subject: The Killing of K. Karuppasamy' 'My uncle was killed under the guise of 'Thalaikoothal', or mercy killing,' 'at the behest of his own son, K. Senthil.' 'However, this was no mercy killing,' 'but cold-blooded murder.' Veera, stop! Tell me What happened to that problem? Uncle's case? They've been jerking me around for the last 5 days. I wrote to the police. They keep putting me off. I was there yesterday from morning till 5 pm. There's no response. Veera, this is your battle. You have to lead. Don't depend on anyone else. You keep going alone, understand? Okay. It's getting late. Come and eat. - Next time. - Come, eat - Okay. Give Murugan my regards. - OKay Bring the salt. - Aren't you eating? - In a bit. You start. Bring the pickle, too. Did you bring in the stuff drying on the terrace? Yes. Sit, and eat. What's this? - Sit and eat. - I'll just change. Later. Eat first. Give him his food. - It's uncle. - Let's see. Show him Ma, give me that plate. Here, ma. Bless his cheerful face. You didn't choose one of him in uniform? He looks so young in this. I chose it because he's smiling. It's nice, ma. He's left us and gone. Put this on the shelf. Give it to me. What happened? What are you thinking about? Why? The cops are ignoring my complaints. Can you hurry these things? You're impatient, like your father. Nothing happens overnight. Eat. - I complained 5 days ago. - So what? - Why get tense? - I keep going there. - They just don't respond. - It takes time. If I let it go now, the issue will never come out. Such impatience! Mani, hand me the newspaper. Why do you want the paper during dinner? If I shout, even our dog won't get up. But the right people will shake the world. 'Please find attached a copy of my police complaint' 'to which there has been no response.' '...my letter to the State Human Rights Commission' 'to which, also, there has been no reply.' Hello? Mr. Veera? I read your mail. This news should go big. Okay, sir. But we're a small publication. If we cover it, it won't reach everyone. Oh! Let me see what I can do. Okay, sir, thank you. Hello, Mr. Veera? Who's calling? This is the editor of the National Debate newspaper in Chennai. Tell me, sir. I've received your police complaint. It's a big story. We're printing it tomorrow. - Give me an ND paper. - Take it. We're sending a reporter to investigate. - Tea? - Yes. They'll call you tomorrow. Hello! Hello. Mr. Veera? Yes, who's this? Deepa, National Debate, Chennai reporter. Tell me, ma'am. Everyone knows Meena, even in the neighboring villages. Even little children threaten their grandparents. If you nag, I'll call Meena. She'll give you a poison injection. So everyone knows her. She works in a hospital. People call her to dispatch the elderly with an injection. You need to be careful. One important matter You don't get any problem for it Yes? I need a medicine, but this is the wrong shop. Which medicine? We have everything. We have a rat problem. I came for some poison. Is someone not well - Hey! Always babbling. Get out! What do you want? My grandmother's not well. I thought I'd give her a tablet. Who said you'd get it here? Where are you from? I've never seen you before. I'm from the next village. I'm visiting my cousin. I told her grandma's not well. She told me I could get it here. How much is a tablet for? Only 10 rupees, but I can't sell it without a prescription. Go see Compounder Ganesan. Hello! - Ganesa, where are you? - In the forest. Boss! - Ganesa! - Yeah, come. They're here. I'll call you back. Come! This is her. What? I need some medicine. They said you'd give me a prescription. You can't decide whether it'll be injection or tablet. We do that. Right? Yes! What else can I do? There are lots of ways to do this. Go meet Rajan. He'll see your grandmother, and discuss rates and methods. Come No, that'll be too expensive. But the tree will fall silently. There'll be no risk to you. No, just give me the prescription. Is this cat killing a rat? It's a human being. If the cops come, who'll be responsible? If you do the job in 10 rupees, what are we here for? - Take her! - Come. Hurry! 6,000 rupees. I need an advance of 2,000. I don't have that much. You're asking me to kill someone. Do you know how risky it is? What was the name of that man last week? - Karuppasamy, boss. - Karuppasamy! 8,000 was the fee. He was dead in 4 hours. I've already given you a discount of 2,000. It's risky to get those injections. Understand? Give me an advance of 2,000. I'll start the work. What was the name of that man last week? - Karuppasamy, boss. - Karuppasamy! 8,000 was the fee. He was dead in 4 hours. You're in the papers today. What do they say? Hide your syringes, or you'll hang. Thalaikoothal is a traditional form of senicide which is practiced in more than 40 villages in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu. It is practiced by the members of the family themselves. They feel burdened. They don't like old people's habits. They wander off, and are messy. It's burdensome. So they think, 'If we do something so they die, 'we can live peacefully.' So they do it. It's awful to take a life, but it's also hard to see them suffer. They have trouble sleeping and breathing. So it's a good thing, but killing is problematic, too. Why do we have children? So they'll care for us at the end as we cared for them, and wash our clothes. That's why we have children. That's why we have children, not so they can kill us. 'Today, we're discussing Thalaikoothal' 'and the killing of K. Karuppasamy.' Everyone knows he did it. At first, we were told that my uncle died of natural causes. So we went to the funeral. There, we heard that his own son had him killed. So everybody knows that he did it in the name of Thalaikoothal. Look it Who did involved.. - What's this? - Senthil, my cousin, - See what Veera's done. - His wife, and 3 other people planned the murder. I should have broken his legs that day. Keep quiet. I only learnt later that this was being done in the name of Thalaikoothal. I found out after my uncle's death I found out after my uncle's death He's on TV. Will it be a problem? No. The whole village does it. Just keep quiet. When Senthil got married, my uncle gave him the house, and moved in with us. After the accident, we said we'd take care of him and the expenses. That hurt Senthil's ego. He felt that people would talk that he didn't take care of his father. When I learnt of the killing, I went to the police. I can't bear his face. I told you he'd make trouble. Forget it, it's not that serious. - What's your name? - Senthil. - Where do you work? - I'm a fitter in a spinning mill, sir. How much did you pay to have your father killed? Why would I kill my father, sir? You paid Rajan 8,000 rupees to kill your father. I didn't kill anyone. What do you mean? I don't know anything about a killing. Here, listen. What was the name of that man last week? - Karuppasamy, boss. - Karuppasamy! 8,000 was the fee. He was dead in 4 hours. I've already given you a discount of 2,000. That's not my voice, sir. How do you make your money? You kill old people for money. - I don't understand. - What? I don't know anything. What? Do you know Meena? No. Is she your wife, or your keep? Are you pimping her? Who's Rajan? Thousands of people come to the hospital, sir. And Rajan's such a common name. Your father died. Did you tonsure your head? I'm looking for a job in Dubai. I can't go bald to interviews. We know how to get the truth. We'll hang you up, and make you talk. Will you talk or not? Who did this killing? I'll tell you, sir. I'll tear you apart. How long have you known Rajan? Speak! - 5 years. - How? He used to be my money lender. One day, he said 'There's a way to make some quick money. Will you do it?' What was it? If I injected certain people with poison, he'd pay me 1,000 rupees. I said, 'I'm not a nurse, I don't know how to give injections.' So then? He gave me some money and asked me to learn from GH Ganesan. Ganesan taught me how to give injections, and how the poisons worked. Her husband kept falling sick. They couldn't afford hospitals. She asked for an alternative. So I taught her how to give glucose injections, sir. - Taught her! - It's the truth, sir. How many people have you killed with poison so far? Answer me! How many people have you killed? Write the names. - I can't write. - But you can kill. - I'll tell you, you write it down. - Tell me. Talk! Ramasami, last month. Then? Before that, Pechiakka. Next? Hurry up. Before that, Bhupathi. The last was Karuppasamy. Mettu street Karuppasamy. You've killed 21 people. How did you carry out the Karuppasamy killing? Speak. What did you do? If you don't talk, I'll eliminate you in an encounter. How did you kill Karuppasamy? Answer me! Tell me, Meena. You said you'd pay 2,500 rupees if I brought a case. Pay me. - Why? - I've found a case. Who? How do you know? I found out from my neighbor, Nagamma. You know Senthil? Gopalan's nephew. His father's bedridden. - Why, what happened? - He broke his hip in an accident. Nagamma's been cleaning him up. He didn't want to pay her 50 rupees a day. Will he spend money on medicines? The tree's rotten. If you touch it, it'll fall. - Will you talk to him? - Yes. Senthil is...? Gopalan's nephew. - Right. I'll talk to him. - Let me know. Senthil. - Who is it? - Sir, one minute. - What do you want? - Come here. My name's Rajan. You don't know me, but I've seen you around. Your uncle Gopalan is a friend. What do you want? I heard your father's bedridden. Was that him calling? What is it you want? I'm late for work. I don't want anything. I've come to help you. Help? With what? Medicines are expensive. Illness burdens the family. How will you take care of him and your family on your salary? What are you suggesting? A small expense, cheaper than his medical care. You say okay, and I'll handle everything. Senthil. How much? Give me 5,000. I'll finish it. 5,000? Impossible. Wait, we're like brothers. Give me 3,500. I'll finish it quietly. 3,500? Come, aunt. This is sudden. I came to see your father. Come, he's inside. 1,500! You said you'd pay 2,500. Keep your money! He's only paying 3,000. How can I pay you 2,500? This is how you keep cheating me. If you want more, you should have spoken to him directly. You can't, right? Keep the money. He's called us at 11 pm. You and your head Cheat! Who's there? Senthil! Senthil! Who are you? Senthil! Don't hurt me. - Don't hurt me. - Nothing Senthil! Don't hurt me. Senthil! Hurry! Hold his hand. Don't hurt me. Don't shout. Don't shout. Don't shout Give me the money. Hello. SP Sekhar. Home Minister. What's the status of the Karuppasamy case? Sir, the enquiry's over. Next, we have to arrest the accused. Look, Mr. Sekhar, Thalaikoothal seems to be a norm in that village. So, if you arrest one person, they'll all accuse each other. You'll have to arrest the whole village. More importantly, the local election is next month. We have to solve this problem before that. Think it over. Sir, this is open news now. I don't know if I can control the press. You'll find a way. Hurry, I need to get home. Me, too. One second. Both of you at the same time - Come, let's go What a bad omen! 5 kilos of rice, 1 litre of oil - We don't have it. Shop somewhere else. Ants never break formation. What time should I come, sir? Okay, I'll be there at 7.30 pm. - Will the Sub-Inspector be there? - Give me some water. Okay, I'll be there. Thank you. - Who was that? - The police station. Who were you talking to? - The editor, Ram. - There's no need. Enough of this running around about uncle's death. He hasn't eaten or slept in 3 months. And that's not all. Can we show our faces outside? Women who used to fear my voice Now mock me to my face. Can this child go out and play now? When I asked the shopkeeper for oil, he insulted me. We've become refugees in our own home. What do you want me to do, ma? You can't change anything, son. You can't change the world. Your dead uncle's not coming back either. Let it go. Listen to me. I won't loss all of you for this. Go, ma. Look at him anger. There's no evidence of murder. If we had the body, the post mortem report... could have uncovered some evidence. Since there's no proof, we're considering closing the case. Sir, is the sting operation on Rajan not enough proof? You can't say that. There's no proof that Karuppasamy was killed. But Meena confessed, sir. That's what you in the media say. When we investigated in the village, people said that Meena was only giving... glucose injections to the elderly. So we've come to the conclusion that Karuppasamy's death was not a case of murder, but a natural death. Satisfied? This is what happens. What can we do? Nobody was ever punished for the killing of Karuppasamy. All set? Shall we leave? Not forgotten anything? A few months later, Senthil got a job... and left with his family for Dubai. I never saw him again. I don't believe in God. But they say the truth will prevail. I'm waiting. 'The Burden'
