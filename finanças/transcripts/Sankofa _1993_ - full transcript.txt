Here is sacred ground, covered with the blood of people who suffered. It is from here that our people were snatched and taken by the white man. Get away from here. Leave this ground. And you, you! Return to your past. This ground is holy ground. Blood has been spilled here before. It was from here that we were bought and sold to America, to Trinidad, to Jamaica.
