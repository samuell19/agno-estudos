French Republic Ecole Polytechnique ALL FIRED UP Who wants good sage? I have good sage! This is very good sage! I still have 3 kilos! 3 kilos and it's over! - Ladies, what would you like? - How much is this? - Hello. - Hello, Miss. - Is this veal or pork? - Pork, Miss. - I'll take this. - Very good. - There you go, Mam. - Thank you. Thank you. Here. And for you, mam? - Sir? - Yes? - The change is wrong. - Excuse me Madam? - Delphine. - Oh, Pauline! Help me. Where were you? - With a friend. - Who? - You don't know her. - What did you do? - Well, we talked about... Next time, tell this boy to come up. - Which boy? - Don't lie to me! I want to talk to him. - I don't want you to talk to him! We know what you want to tell us and we don't care! I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm fed up, fed up, fed up! - What's the matter? - She was with that boy. Again? Did you take green beans? - I took a cauliflower. - The girls won't like it. They'll eat what we have. We'll make a gratin. Who does she think she is? Always on my back! She's spying me like I'm still 8 years old! She decides everything! Who I can see, who I can't see! I can't stand it anymore! I'm suffocating! Hey, don't shout like that! I'm sick. You're not! I can't stand you neither! I'm sick of it! Go, if you're sick of it. Yes! I'll do that! I'll go live with Julien! This boy may be nice. But let me tell you... Shut up! Nobody loves you! But someone loves me. Someone loves me! - How do you feel? - Okay. - You still have a fever? - No, 37 degrees. - My legs hurt. - Because you stay in bed. Tomorrow, you'll go back to school. It will be Friday. I'll go on Monday. Delphine? - I'm off! - Put your slippers, you'll get cold! Delphine, open the door. You'll be fine. - It's OK, my little one. Calm down, calm down. Someone's asking for Dad. - Who? - A man. - Miss Valance? - Yes? - I'm trying to reach your father. - He doesn't live here. - Do you know where I can...? - No. He's in Canada, I believe. - Not anymore. He's here, in France. You didn't know it? He didn't write or call you? No. He's not that kind of a man. Really? I'm sorry. Well, if by chance you hear of anything, I'll be in Paris for a few days. I really need to see him. You can reach me at this number, anytime. My name is Nash. Mister Nash. Goodbye, Miss. Madam. Do I send Juliette to school tomorrow? Do I send her to school? Let her do what she wants. I already told her 15 times. I am tired, Granny. I get mad. Everything I do is wrong. Don't say that. You do everything right. You are my little Pauline. What would we do without you? Minister, how do you feel about this meeting? We've been delayed by weather problems. We will have... Minister, do you think Great Britain will be an obstacle? - Do you have a dead line, Minister? - Will you make any concessions? I will talk to you later. Listen, let's talk seriously. I won't accept that. France won't accept that. We're not bargaining here. Mister President, we shall return to the agenda. - Let's set them up. - How? Let's just create a relation between pound and others currencies. - OK, but... Every country ownership rate would be equal to the middle rate of these currencies. Let's apply it on total population. - And GNP. And that on trade balance. Gentlemen... I have a proposal to make to you. Disorganization... Disorganization of the international system of payments could have been a new link between the European community members. I note with regret that it hasn't been the case. In these conditions, France won't continue the negotiations. Gentlemen, I'm sorry, I have to report this to the President first. Minister, isn't this break good news for Breton farmers who are your electors? Please, M. Quentin, spare me that kind of comment. Miss Valance, a few words. - I'll see that on Tuesday. - Good. They say France is lost without you. Where were you this morning? I want to write a great article about you. Or a weekly TV show that could be called: "In the corridors of power, a mysterious young lady..." If you write about me... - What? - I'll never see you again. It won't be a big change. I see you once every 3 months... I miss you Pauline. What's wrong? - Nothing. - Why don't you stay? - No, I can't. - Why? - Because! - Miss Valance! - Yes! In 30 years, when you'll be talking on TV, I'll tell my children: "I was in love with this old lady and now she's Prime Minister." "In love", yes... But "love", with her, means... - Thank you. - No, thank you. You are my body- guard. - Well, it's my job, Sir. I feel a little guilty towards you, Pauline. - Why? - I am sorry that I never can find a time when we could talk about something different, about you, your life... - Yes. Well, good night Sir. - Would you like to... - See you tomorrow. Take me home. Miss Valance, it's impossible! We can't sleep! Close the windows! And tell your Grand- mother we still don't have hot water! - I told the manager! - But she's the owner! - Pauline! - Pauline! Here is her little dad's pride! Pauline, I didn't see you coming in. We called you, you were gone. - When did you arrive? - At 7:30, nobody was... - Granny wasn't here. - I mean here in France. Since about ten, fifteen days. I wasn't in Paris, otherwise I would have come earlier. I had to go to Jura. No other choice. And I have to tell you that Jura, at this time... - Yes... - Why, is Jura dangerous? - Depends for who... - Did you have diner? Take a piece of cake. - You could have let us know. - I sent a post card from Canada. - We never got it. It might be lost. It happens. - When do you leave? - I'm staying here. - For a long time? - Forever. You don't look happy. No, I'm very happy. OK, everybody's here? Now, the presents! Yeah! Presents! Presents! Presents! Presents! Who is all that for? Here we are! This one is for you, Mum. That one is for Juliette. No Delphine. That one is for you. - Thank you, Dad! And that one for my big little daughter! Take everything, kids! - All that? - What is it? A rabbit? - No, they all wear that in Canada. - It's too big. - It's better than too small. Try the gloves. - What is it? - Look! Oh thank you, Dad! It's from Peru, I found it in Toronto. Do you like it? - Oh yes! How did you know I needed a watch? That's how it is. Look! Here, give it to me. We've got to put battery in it. - What's your plan? - Uh? - What's your plan here in France? - Well, I don't know yet. Are you going to manage a casino? A casino? Not necessarily, why? - Wasn't it your job in the Bahamas? - Well, I can do different jobs. What else can you do? Look, I add 18 and 29 and I push this button. Not bad, uh? Hello? It's for you. Who is it? Who's asking for him? M. Nash, the man who came yesterday. - I'm not here. - He's not here, Sir. No, I swear. Well, I don't know why I... Sir? What? What? Give me the phone. Hello Nash, it's me. What do you want? Who told you that? How much? No, certainly not. Not even for the double. No, I don't want it. We don't have to talk, I told you it's impossible! That's how it is. You'll tell them. Well, I have to go, I'm busy. Yes, I know, I know. Goodbye. Mrs Chapeau... I recognise this. This is Arlette's house. How is Aunt Arlette? - It's the same: always complaining. We should live in a house like that. It's too small here. - Yes, I want my bedroom. - Yes. I can't stay here, you live cramped together. Tell me, did you repay Aunt Arlette? I'll do it, Granny. You're going to hurt yourself. - Don't worry. - Is that you with a moustache? - No. No, it's me, in my "Chat Bott?" suit! Oh, yes. Oh, Pauline, you're beautiful with your long hair. When was it? It's not me, it's Mum. Are you OK? He didn't do it on purpose, you know him. Yes, I know. Come in. Look. Isn't he cute? - Who is that one? - His name's Jean- Marc. He's so nice. But Pauline forbids me to see him. Why not, if he's nice? Does he love you? - Yes. Well, he doesn't say it, but we like each other. Well, that's fantastic! What's better in life? What do his parents do? She's taking her Bac in one month, so if you don't want her to work, go both of you! You'll teach her French and Physics, she's bad. - It's not true! I had the average! - Because you cheated! - Liar! - Forget about it, kids! Would you like some coffee? No, thanks Mum. What time is it? - Half past midnight. - Really? I've got to go. I promised people I was coming and I forgot. I'm sorry, really. But I have to go. Goodbye. I'll call you tomorrow, without fail. Tomorrow or... the next day. And... Bye! Don't cry, don't cry. Oh no! No, girls, no! Granny, you're not going to start! - That's because of the girls! It's so sad! He was here and now, he's gone! Maybe we won't see him again! - So what? He always does that. With Mum, with us, everybody! What's different? Miss Valance! Don't implicate us in the consequences of decisions we could not have made. How was the meeting? - Very good. - I made that for you. - Blandin is at the Council. It's great, I'm very happy for him. He's brilliant. - The problem is that he is careerist. - I don't know what you think about it. - Uh? Oh, yes. - He's great. - Hello. Sorry! Excuse me. I'm really sorry. I am absolutely sorry. - It doesn't stain! - It's just Champagne. - I'm absolutely... What are you doing here? - I was at your office. A nice guy told me where you were. - You can't stay here. - Why? - How did you get in? - Calm down. I arrived... What's the problem? What have I done? Excuse me. I haven't slept. I needed to talk to you. Last night was awful. We can't stay like that. It sounds like you hate me. Oh, I know what you think. I didn't do the right thing. With your mother, I should have... But we can't always talk about the past. Life goes on! And look at what you've become! And a little thanks to me. No? - What are you saying? Think about it! You had the desire to fight, to get out of it. Why? Because I wasn't here! If I had stayed here, all soft with you, you would have never done anything, never. Pauline? Do you remember the Chinese protocol? - Yes. - Come with me. Sir. - Sir. - Sir, you don't know my father. Oh, excuse me. Nice to meet you, M. Valance. Pleased, very pleased. He's saying that you didn't respect the equality between our two countries. Well, I don't understand. We'll both work on this project purely at the same level. - It's not what you said. - Sorry? He is not translating right. He apologies. It's a misunderstanding. - Oh, good. Thank you M. Valance. Where did you learn Chinese? - Singapore. What is he saying? - I don't know! M. Valance, do you have a car? - I'll take a cab. - No, I'll drop you off. The daughter wasn't enough, now he wants the father. - Where are you going? - To my hotel. - Where is it? - The Plaza. - Oh, you live at the Plaza. - Yes, it's convenient, central... Goodbye sweetheart, I'm leaving for 8 days. I call you when I'm back. Goodbye, thank you. - Good night, see you soon. - Good evening M. Valance. - Good evening. No message? No, nothing. But two men are waiting for you. Listen Nash, do not insist, the answer is "no". Is that clear? - You're wrong. - Really? We want to be part of this business. You get it? I don't need this kind of money. So go back say that to your friends. They won't be happy. Ah, sorry. Good, excuse me... Valance! You won't find the money. - You think that? - That money you don't like, you will cry to get it back. Excuse me. Here. Can I make a confession? I was always thinking of you over there. - Where? - This winter, in Canada. It was so cold. I would wonder where you were, what you were doing. Before that, in the Bahamas, it was always sunny and time went by so fast. And one day, I said: "It's over. I'm going back home." And now, here with you, a real life can start. You want me to stay? Yes. - Are you sure? - Of course. You know what we should do? We should buy a house. A big house, where everyone has their room. - Oh yes! I found one in St Cloud. There's a big garden... - Really, so I can have dogs? Of course! What do you say, Mum? - Maybe, yes. But... - But, what? - Would you be living with us? - Sure, we would be all together. What do you say? How much is this house? - I don't know, 300, 400 million. - You have the money? - No, but I can find it. - Really? Where? We just need to sell the building. It's not useful. Do you agree, Granny? Selling the building! Wait! It's her building! It's all she has. - Well, Dad talked about it first. - Me? - Yes, you said... - I said, at the moment, the business is good. - We don't want to do business, isn't it? - I just want you to be happy. - You changed your name? - It's a friend's card. I'll explain later. Here. For your trip. Your attention please, on track number 2, passengers are informed that Europe- Express number 53, going to Metz, Luxembourg, Frankfurt... Girls, don't get into trouble. - When will you be back? - Next week. Don't forget the dentist. See you Granny. - Don't get cold, sweetheart. - Don't worry. Work well! She's not going to school. She's a big girl now! Remember your school Rue St Jacques? You didn't want to go the first day. We had to bring you back home. - You were there? Yes... Exceptionally! OK, let's go. - Where are we going? - To St Cloud. - Why? - To see the house! - The house? - Yes! You're going too fast. Title 2: 206 585 250. Title 3: 341 194 000. Title 4: 2 billion... - OK, how much in total? - In unit of account? - In Francs. - I'll tell you. Let's multiply that by 5,9. - My respects, Minister. - Hello. So in title 4, you'll find community policies, with regard to research, technology, industry, environment and energy and raw material supply. Excuse me. Antoine! But, but... Sorry, it's dangerous here. There have been accidents. Thank you. Wait for me! Come, come! - When can we talk? - After the meeting. You grand- mother is on the phone. - I can't talk to her now. - She said it's urgent. - Ask her what she wants. - It's about a building. She wants to sell it... - Where is the phone? Excuse me. Granny? - Oh Pauline, my dear! - What's happening? You dad found buyers for the building. He was like madman! Calm down. I'll see that with him. It will be too late. It has to be signed today! Say no. He waited for 20 years, he can wait for 2 days. - He's at the notary. - He can't do anything without you. - I gave him a proxy. Oh no, you haven't done that! - Was it wrong? - Have you lost your mind? - It's him that... - Don't trust him. Now he can do what he wants! Run to the notary! I can't with my leg! Go with Mrs Chapeau. Where is it? Rue Dufau. - OK, take the metro. - I don't have tickets. Well, I don't know, take a cab. Don't you get it? He's ripping you off! Remember Aunt Arlette. You'll be penniless and you'll finish in an asylum and it will be... Hello? Hello Granny? Hello? What's the matter? Are you crying? Are you sick? Answer me! Hello? Can you hear me? Granny, are you there? Talk to me. Pick up the phone. I'm scared. Don't cry like that. Granny, hello? Is everything OK, Pauline? - My grand- mother is in trouble. - Do you need to go back? - Yes, maybe. Hello, Mrs Chapeau? It's Pauline. Please go to our place, my grandmother just fainted! Pauline! Where are you going? - To Paris! What's happening? Why didn't he stay in Canada? He said it was too cold. And too hot in Bahamas. - What was he doing over there? - He was managing a casino. - Which one? - Abaco. - Abaco, wow! - Why? There was a big scandal 2 years ago. You didn't know? - No. The games were rigged. They had to close. Oh no... - Was it at that time? - Yes. - How did he get away? - I don't know. I can't believe it! - What? - The building is sold. - Really? What about your father? - He disappeared. - And your grandmother? - She can't stop crying. Well, this house can be nice. Have you seen it? You don't get it. He did everything in my back. Come on, let's go, hurry up! - Do I wait for you? - Yes, no, as you wish. Miss Pauline, I did what you told me. I gave her syrup. She felt asleep right away. - What about my dad? - Still no news. Your sisters are looking for him. Well, I think I'll go... - OK, Mrs Chapeau, thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - You're really... - I can come back. I keep the keys. - Yes, it's safer. Pauline! Pauline, Pauline! Sorry, it's our fault! - Did you find him? - No, we went to the Plaza. He doesn't live there. He lied to us! So we thought he was buying the house in St Cloud. We went there and you know what they told us? The house is not for sale! It never has been! He lied to us, he lied to us! - Excuse me Sir? - Yes? Miss Valance? That's me. "My dear Mum, my dear daughters." "We won't be able to buy the house. It's not for sale anymore." That is why... "Don't be disappointed. We'll buy another one," "maybe more beautiful. The big project I have in mind" "will provide us money for ever. This battle is hard." "If I win, you'll be proud of me as I am proud of you." - What does that mean? - He's setting up a business. - Which business? - He doesn't say it. - Read the rest. - That's all. - He doesn't say where he is? - No! Impossible! Give me the letter. Give it to me! - He can't be gone with the money. - That's what he wanted. He got us. - No, he'll come back, he will call. He always calls back. Well, don't trust him... Where can he be? Call the notary, he might know it. Mrs Chapeau! Mrs Chapeau? - Stay in bed, Granny! Oh Pauline, you're back! - Why are you up? - I'm fine. Leave me alone! Antoine! Antoine, help me! Leave me alone, Sir! - Calm down. Calm down! - I have to talk to your dad! - He's not here. - It's very important. Do you know where he is? - I'll find him, don't worry. Call the notary. Quick! We'll find your son. And we'll bring him back to you, I swear. I knew it. From the first day, I knew he was lying. His eyes become yellow. What's funny? - Nothing. I see you smiling. You're glad I've been duped? Where are we? We should be on the National Road. - Hey! Ho! Excuse me! - Turn left! Turn left! It's like you're doing it on purpose! For once in your life, can you stop telling me off? Uh? Radio 47, 24 hours a day. The worst part is everyone forgives him. He's been a disaster for this family and they forgive him. It drives me crazy. 15 years ago, he found some land near Montpellier. He wanted to build a palace, a casino. We all put our money into this project. What happened? He built one floor and that's it. We lost everything. After that, he left France. - Don't do that. It's... - It's wood, yes, you told me that! You don't care, he's not your father. That's so you, the people watcher, indifferent, the journalist... What are you doing? - There is a hotel here. What's happening to you? I don't want to go there! Listen, it's 3 in the morning. I've been nice, now I'm tired. Here, the car papers. You'll go fix your problems with your dad and I'll go sleep. Come back! How will you get back to Paris? - I'll take the train! Watch out! Move! - I'm looking for M. Valance. - Why? I'm his daughter. Oh really? Sorry. Wait, I'm coming. You father could have warned me. Nice to meet you, Raoul Sarazin. - Where is he? - Close to the lake. You haven't seen him? - No. Come with me. So what do you think. It's beautiful, isn't it? Of course... - Who are you? Sorry? Who are you? - Me? Your dad didn't tell you? - Not really. So we... You're his daughter, right? We were missing 1,2 billion. So I found a Swiss bank. We are partners. We buy the casino together. Come. No, this won't stay like that. You'll see, it will be beautiful. Victor! We had a party yesterday. - When do you buy it? Today. You're right on time. We sign the contract at 11 at city hall. Victor! Look who's here! Jane... Jane, wake up. No, no, no... Oh, who do I see there? - Where is the check? - What check? - The one for the notary. - It's at the city hall. - And the proxy? - Same thing. We're signing today! You won't and you neither! My grandmother won't buy a casino. Your partner is a crook. Find another. - Don't worry Raoul. - Victor? Pauline! - Victor? - She's my daughter. Is that true? What is she doing here? I don't know! Tell me the truth Who is that money? - Me. Don't listen to her. - Who was the building? - None of your business. - Are you kidding? Raoul, leave me alone. This is my business, my daughter. So I see that with her and you take your breakfast, OK? Hello, gentlemen. Hello. Hello? Hello, yes? Can I... Hello? Can I talk to Ma?tre Lambert? Oh, it's you Ma?tre. - What do you want from him? - M. Valance? - Yes, what? I have two guys. Should we start? What are you waiting for? Go ahead! Should I file a complaint? An application? To which court? What if I refer to the prosecutor? What are you doing? You want me to go to jail? - That's it! - Can I explain? Can I explain? Good. You know what this casino is? You know what it represents? When the owner died, everybody wanted to buy it. His wife never wanted to sell it. I convinced her. - Really, how? I knew how to talk to her. She's an old woman, but very artistic. Yes, I see. No, no! Can't you do that elsewhere? - You said... - Go further. - OK, let's go to the patio. Yes, Ma?tre? Yes, it's me. We've been cut. So, what do I do? Wait. Leave me alone! - No, you have to see this. Look. The border with Switzerland is here, on the lake. They don't have casinos. So when they want to play, they'll come here. It's a jackpot! You want me to pass on an idea like this? No, I won't. One day, you'll thank me! - Are you leaving? - Yes, but I'll be back. You know where the police station is? - No. - I'll find it. Victor! Don't let her go, she's going to the police! Where is she? Pauline! Pauline. Don't be stupid! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Are you OK? - Yes. Stop her! Stop her! - Stop the car! Stop her! Stop her! - Hey, slowly! - Be careful! Open the door! Back off! Move back! Come here! Give me your hand! Come here. Come, give me your hand. Leave me alone, I'm fine. There, on the bed. Oh, oh, oh! Hey! Here my dear, drink, drink. There you go. Call the Lord Chancellor. Tell him to see Granny. OK, Madam. - Oh no! - OK? - Don't tell him anything. - OK, OK. I'm cold. What are you doing? She has to be undressed. She can't stay like that. Help me. Help me! That's enough. Thank you. Very nice, thank you, bravo. Leave me alone! You'll go to jail with him. Then you'll have him for you alone. We quit. You can keep him. - What is she saying? - Whatever. She's shocked, of course. You organized everything with her. That's enough. Take that off, it's wet. Pauline! - No! Yes, what? The doctor's here. Well, Miss, things don't look so bad. Doctor, take me with you, quick! You must call the police. - Yes, of course. They took my grandmother's money! You have to stop them! All of them! - We'll leave you, doctor. - Good. That's all she had, do you understand? Every time, it's the same thing: she wasn't here when we sold the building, so she's furious. She wants to do everything. - What happened? When? Stop it, I'm tired. What happened with your mother? Nothing, she's very happy! - It's wrong. - What do you mean? - Yes, it's wrong. - Well, if nobody trusts me... Oh my goodness! My bankers. - Already? - Yes. - Go ahead, I'll join you. - Hurry up, uh? M. Valance. It's all good, don't worry. She's losing her mind but that's normal... Today's young girls are under pressure. It's true. - They are fragile. - They are sensitive. Anything can scratch or scare them. She has to sleep. I'll give her an injection and... What are you doing? Open the door! Will you open! Pauline, do you hear me? Open it! Open that door now! Pauline! - Well, in this business... - Come here! Pauline! Help! Leave me alone! - Calm down, calm down! - No! - You have to stay in bed. - No! It's embarrassing. Look at these people. They are Swiss bankers. - Swiss bankers? No! Good Lord! Don't put your money there! They are crooks! Don't let them do it, they will rip you off! I know what I'm talking about, I work for the Ministry of Finance. Sorry, she's my daughter. She's a little... Come here! Watch out for him, he is a liar. He did it to my grandfather too! Just a moment, gentlemen, I'm coming. A girl so young, so pretty... It's so sad for a father. - Now, that's enough, you stop it! - No, never! You got all of them, but you won't get me! What are you saying? Remember what happened 15 years ago? - You know nothing. - I know! - You were too young. - Mum told me. Don't you get it? That's why I'm doing this. This time, I'll succeed! It will be the greatest casino in Europe. And it will be for you, your sisters. - When? - Later. - When you'll be dead? Well, yes. When is that? You are everything I hate. You are cold, you don't have a heart. You're like ice, hard and sharp. You're the opposite of a woman. - Oh my God... - Doctor! Doctor, help me! Help me! They are upstairs! I gave her an injection. She will sleep all day long. Tomorrow, she will be OK. Just call me. Are you leaving her here? - Yes, she'll be fine. You'll come check on her. - Why me? Because we have to go. The appointment is at 11, I'm not dressed. - What are you doing? Are you locking her up? - Yes. She's sick and... I'm doing my best! It's complicated enough. What's the matter with me? - You don't love anybody. One day, nobody will love you anymore. And you'll end up alone. Hello? M. Brenno? Hello? What's the problem? Why is he running like that? His daughter is sick. Are you sure he doesn't know? No, it's fine. - Ah, Sir... - Here he is. Got to go. We're going first. Follow us. - M. Valance. - Ah, splendid! Perfect, M. Minot. Gentlemen... M. Sagoni, on my right. Charming... Superb, isn't it? M. Minot, bring us some appetisers. Some saveloy, some duck p?t?... We need to add a plate. - For who? - M. Nash. - What? - He's coming. - What's he doing here? - Having lunch with us. Impossible. What's wrong Raoul? Can I sit here? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Oh, you didn't know? The bank of Zurich, is our bank. It belongs to us. You were so obstinate. We had to find a way. So we spoke with your friend Sarazin instead. Wait, I can explain everything. Listen Victor, don't be mad... M. Valance, M. Valance! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down! Stop him! Gentlemen, stop it, you're fool! - We have to catch him again. - We'll do. I'll call an ambulance. Valance! Why did you come? Everything was going well. You said he would never know. - Did I say that? - Yes, you promised me. - Really? I might have forgotten. - Is the contract signed? - Yes. - OK, see you on Monday. - Goodbye. Victor. - Is she still sleeping? - No, she's awake. - OK. How is she? - She looks better. She doesn't want to eat. She's not hungry. - What is it? - Soup. - What's in it? - Mushrooms. She hates mushrooms! She only likes sugar. It's not hard to make a dessert! What happened? What's wrong, Victor, tell me. - Nash. - What "Nash"? He owes Raoul's bank. Oh no... and Raoul? Raoul, the bank bought him. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. What do you mean? It's not possible! You're not going to repeat the Bahamas... Stop. Keep your advice for later. Don't worry Sarazin, in one year, you'll be both rich and all will be forgotten. These qualms never last. Good night. I heard you're doing better. You must eat. You haven't eaten since yesterday. Look, I made blazed apples for you. You still like them? - I'm not hungry. It was your favourite dessert. Just try them. Come on. Go ahead, it's not that hot. Come on, open your mouth. Come on... No! You're wrong, it's very good. What's the matter? No, don't cry, please. - Leave me alone. - Don't cry, it hurts me. And your eyes will go red. They are so beautiful. Ten times more than your sisters' eyes. But don't tell them. I'm so proud of you, you know? You're very beautiful. It's not true. I'm ugly. And cold as ice, you said it. - I said that because I was mad. I'm like this because of you. You were never there. - Well, I'm here now. - Now, it's too late, I don't need you anymore. Go away. Go find your American! I hope you're happy together, because I'm happy with nobody. Go away! Victor... Well, let me talk to you! I couldn't refuse. It was a miracle. I didn't tell you, but I'm broke, I'm penniless. I owe 60 million in taxes. So, when they found me... It's not that bad, the casino is ours. - What do you think? You know what will happen? Rigged games, laundered money... I worked ten years for them, I can't anymore. And you bring them back to me. - But... - Go away! Leave me alone. What are you doing? Are you leaving? - I can't stay, Victor. I like you a lot, but now, I can't do it anymore. It'll never change. We came here for a new life, and look were we are after 3 days. I am out of here. I can't take it anymore. I'll find a plane in Geneva. Can you close my suitcase? Victor! It's nothing. I'm OK. I'm fine, I'm fine. Sir? Do you know where my clothes are? No. Are you leaving? Yes. Can you bring me to the train station? No, no, I can't... - He's sick! - Who? Victor? Yes. Are you happy now? You won! It's your fault! Where is the phone? - Oh yes, the phone! Faster! It's not plugged in. Wait. - Hurry up! - Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening. This time, it's the father? - Yes. - And the daughter? - She's OK. Good. Is this common? - I don't think so. Does he have a family doctor? Is he under regular care? Well, I don't know. So M. Valance, what is it? Leave us. Leave us alone. I'll be fine. I feel better, it's over. But don't tell them. Tell them I need some rest, some tranquillity. Anyway, it wouldn't hurt me. I had a big day. - A hard one? There are days like this. - I don't know what happened... It happens to me. I see white. - That's the eyes. - You really think? - Yes. You see, Doctor... It's terrible. Every time I start something new, it becomes the opposite of what I want. Why? They own companies all around the world. They infiltrate everywhere. When a business looks juicy, they take it under control. He should have been prudent. A Swiss bank... He trusted them. He was so happy. Can I talk to you, Ladies? You stay out! - Antoine? - Oh, is that you? - Did I wake you up? - No, I was working. Where are you? - Close to Evian. Oh... Are you mad at me? I behaved badly last night. And I'm always like that with you. You're sure you're not mad at me? - I'm sure. I like you a lot, you know? I like you a lot too. Are you there? - Yes. How is your father? Not very good. He's sick. Can I ask you to bring here my grandmother and my sisters? - When? - Now. It would be very... - With what car? - Yours. You have it. It's true. Well, find another one. So you go to Evian. You take N5 to Amphion. Then you turn right, stay on that road 3 km, and then on your left... Tell me, where is your car? - Wish I could kiss you. - Really? - Yes, kiss you. - Me too. Yes? - M. Sarazin, please. - Just a moment. Sarazin! Phone! - Hello? - Sarazin? M. Nash. Yes, it's me. - I'd like to see you both tomorrow. - Tomorrow, it will be complicated, he's sick. - He's sick? Yes, I swear! He fell like a stone! Is this your friend? Give me the phone. No, no, leave it! But, don't... Hello, M. Nash? It's Pauline Valance. We know each other. Listen, I know everything. Forget what you want to do with this casino. My grandmother won't like it. And that's her money. You wanted my father, now you've got an old lady! And you've got me! And trust me, you won't fool me! It's over for you. Tomorrow, I'll call the financial police. - Shut up! - Forget your European projects. Your bank is Bank of Zurich? Yes, I know them. - Stop! Give me a break! - Hello? Hello? Hello, M. Nash? Hello? He hung up. I think they got it. Good night. I was living with friends near Mexico City. One night, there was a party. Your father arrived. It was very late, two in the morning. He was laughing. He looked so... I couldn't move. He looked at me and voil?, we stayed together. - When was it? - Five years ago. The next year, we went to the Bahamas. And there, he started to talk about moving back to France. He was always talking about you. He was proud of your studies. Why didn't he come back earlier? Maybe because of me. I was afraid of you. I was thinking: "If he gets back to his daughters, I'll never see him again." Roberto, you stay here. Where is Valance? - Over there, but... He's sick. - Where is his daughter? - Why? - M. Nash wants to see them. - Both of them? - Yes. Don't pay attention, she's crazy. It's OK, it's OK! Wake up, quick! Victor! Don't open it, don't open it! Victor! No! No! - Where are we going? - To Switzerland. Watch out! It's Raoul. Wait. No, don't touch it. - Are you Antoine? - Yes. Where are the girls, the grandmother? I don't know. Weren't you supposed to bring them? Yes, I went to pick them up but they weren't there. The door was open, nobody was there. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Can you open the window? Thank you. Slow down, she feels sick. Hey! Tell him to slow down, she's sick! Are you OK, Pauline? Here! Come! Let's go. Hey! It's this way. - It's this way. - No, this way. Wait. Come here. Take one. Come on! What's wrong? - I don't know how to ride. You never learned? No. Who? Come on, push it, pedal! Push it, push it, push it, push it! There you go! Where are we going? Up there. We'll go down the other side, to the valley. OK, let's go. Are you OK? - Yes. You think they'll find us? - No, don't worry. Come on, just a little bit further. That's better. Help me! Give me the stones, over there! Good. Bring another one. Is that good? No. - Are you still cold? - A little. Hold on. There you go. There you go... I love storms. I've always loved them. Liar... In the country, at Aunt Arlette's, you would hide under your bed. - I just wanted you to look for me. - I never came? - No, never. That's so me. All my life, I've been looking for I don't know what and I missed everything. I understand why you're mad at me. - I'm not mad at you anymore. Yesterday, you wanted to put me in jail. That was yesterday. Look! There's a house. They must have a phone. - Wait, don't run. Are you coming? Leave me alone! I want to see her! Pauline! Run, run! It's a trap! - Pauline! - Daddy! There they are! My girls! My girl... My darling. Juliette! Oh, my children. I'm exhausted. Pauline! Antoine! So, Victor? Am I still your friend? I did not hesitate. The police are here thanks to me. - Who's that guy? - Her fianc?. - Her fianc?? - I mean, her... A good guy. If he wasn't there... Dad, this is my friend Antoine Quentin. - Hello, Sir. - Sir. Good evening, Minister. Tonight, no Minister. I'm here privately. - My respects, Madam. - Sir. Go ahead. - Very nice colonnade. - Isn't it? Ah, the casino... I've been hearing about it for 6 months. Your daughter is obsessed with it. I couldn't have done it without her. You know she restarted the business. With English capital, I know. Smart move. - What are you doing? - We need tables. - Minister, this is Raoul Sarazin. - Good evening. Good evening. OK, let's go. - Sarazin? Your ex- partner? - Yes, yes. - He's still in the business? No, he's broke, but he's my friend. Place your bets, gentlemen. Square, horse, plain. Nothing's missing. My dear Pauline. My wife. - Good evening. - Good evening. M. Valance. Two men are asking for you. M. Valance? Commissioner Jeanset. Can we talk? - Come dance with me. - Wait, I'm feeling lucky. Stop it, you're going to ruin us. Come. OK, look: all on red! No more bets. 17, black, odd and missing. OK, let's go dancing. I have to go. - Where? - To the Bahamas. - Are you kidding? - They want to question me. Don't worry, they can't do anything. They'll question me. So what? - Do you know why? - Guess. - M. Nash. I'm going with you. Goodbye! See you soon! - Shouldn't we... - Don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Can't they wait 'til tomorrow? - No, they're waiting for me. - That's true? - Yes, Miss. - You won't stay there, uh? - No. Bye sweetheart. Bye, my angel. Don't be scared. I'll be back. And I didn't kill anybody. OK, let's go. You take care of everything. I will. How are you going to do it with your job? I'll resign. - Good night, Miss. - Good night, Georges. - Are we open tomorrow? - Of course, at 4. Nothing's changed.
