What's goin' on down there? Dad? Harriet priestly just called your mama. Her husband drove by the store and said the lights were still on. What are the lights still doing on? I'm cookin' the books as usual, dad. The sign, guy. The sign is still on. Are we open for business all night now? No. Sorry. I, uh, I'll turn that right off. Is that music playing on one of the store hi-fis? I'll turn that right off, too. "Turn that off, too." Dang. Ohh. But I thought you already decided on the echoes. Nah. Some band in buffalo's the echoes. Anyway, I wasn't wild about that. Let's just... Call us the... band you're about to hear. How 'bout the corvettes? Is that the corvettes or the chordvettes? No. Corvettes, like the car. Well, see, I was thinkin', like, the chord... Chordvettes. Like chords in our music. No. Here you are. That's 10 cents. Is that skitch Patterson? - Hi. - Hey there. Mornin', everybody. Mornin'. Hey, guy. Well, here we are. Erie's lone beatnik. Any others? What about the tempos? You know, tempos? Not the tempos. Tempos... I was in a band already called the tempos. We were... Terrible. Hey, guy, weren't you the drummer in the tempos? Heard that. I keep comin' back to the herdsmen. How 'bout the big tippers? I like it. Ok, skitch. You wanna experience shame tonight? We're playin' the mercyhurst college talent show. It's gonna be hilarious. Jimmy and the herdsmen. Chad gonna solo on wipeout? Oh, you know, every song is wipeout to Chad. Enjoy your breakfast. See ya, Faye. I gotta pass, but if you kids need any new wires or plugs, give me a call. All right, well, you're gonna miss it. College giris, co-eds... By the fistful. Ooh, hey, my dad wants a roto-antenna. Tell him to come by the store. He already talked to a salesman at tele-mart. That's a big mistake. Lenny, those cats don't know squat about service. Hey, hey, hey. Lookin' good. Hmm? Morning. Don't we open at 10:00 on Saturdays? Yes, we do. And it's a good thing. You know, like the flock that follows, but it's like " herds" with a e-a. So it's like heardsmen, - so it's one of the six senses. - Right. So it's spelled like that. What do you think? A big herd. Heards. I don't get it. No, it's spelled like this, so it's heards, so it's one of the senses. Music heards. I don't- i don't get it. Yeah, do it. Oh, heards, like hear. Yes. It's, like, heardsmen. Heardsmen. Oh, no. Oh. Ow. Guys. Chad fell down. Ok, Venus? Ok, Steve. Right. Let's go. Unh! Oh, hey. Look at this. See this? My grandma and I watched this. Three weeks, we've been watching it, and last week, she realizes there's strings. They're puppets. Yeah. They're marionettes. That's what they are. What can I help you with today, gentlemen? We have a big proposition for you, guy. You, uh, you still, uh, playing percussión? I told you he was, didn't I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every day. We need you, skitch. How 'bout sittin' in for Chad, just for tonight. Why? Asshole... Just broke his arm. Let's check out these clock radios over here, huh? Oh, yeah. Would anyone notice if Chad busted his arm? Ha ha. These are the clock radios, fellas. So... what's this tune? Well, it's an original that I wrote. Hey. We wrote. It's nothing you can't handle. It's just for tonight. And if we win, we split $100. Um... Wow. Playin' in a group again. Man, that sounds like fun. All right, here's the deal. If you want these magic hands, you gotta buy two new record needles. And this radio. Are you serious?

That Jimmy fella certainly has a gal pal in Faye. They make a cute couple, huh? The only other band I was in was my uncle's band. We played this wedding for free, and then we broke up. This one gets a paying gig. So, what are you doin' next weekend? Are you kidding? I'm gonna see my boyfriend's music group. Award-winning music group.

Hell, he couldn't turn a light off at the house. Why would he ever turn one off down here at the store? Know what that is? Presidential flash cards? A bonus. Do you know why? I have no idea. To entice you back. The word is out on you o-neders. Hey, that's o-nedders. The door went up on your second set tonight. People were callin' their friends to come down to Villapiano's. Yeah?

Yeah, I mean, we could, like, sell copies of them right here for a buck apiece. There's a sound booth at tele-mart that we could use. No, that's for, like, two people. That's for birthday greetings. You're talkin' to Spartacus here. I happen to have a relative in the record industry. Ooh. Uncle Bob? Uncle- who's uncle Bob? He records church music.

One of the good things about your group is there's a nice... Natural, raw quality. I like that. Thank you. And I wanna tell you, I've been around. And I think this... Is a hit record. And I found that a hit record is like a stew. All the ingredients have to cook together just right. Otherwise, it's just soup. Not too early in the day for one of these, I hope. I'm thirsty. I'm not sure about this. It's a standard management contract. It says if I do my job, you guys make money. How do we make money? Yeah, how? You gonna wrangle us up some dances at roller rinks, youth for Christ jamborees- rock 'n' roll shows in steubenville, youngstown, Pittsburgh, places like that. - Really? - Yeah. - Pittsburgh? Steubenville. Yeah. And how would you like to hear that thing you do on the radio? I'd love to. Um, sure. Well, then, leave it to me. And here's your guarantee. If I don't get this record going, and I mean serious radio airplay inside of a week- 10 days at the most- we'll tear this up. I'm no longer your manager. I don't know. I'm reluctant to sign anything that has to do with my music. What, are you crazy? A man in a really nice camper wants to put our song on the radio. Give me a pen.

Would you play some friggin' music? Come on! All right. 1... 2... Forget it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right now! Look, guy, I keep telling ya. You are the drummer. You're the backbone, the timekeeper. You can't let a tepid reaction from one matinee house affect your dedication to the band. I was playing like one of those wind-up monkey toys. They booed us off the stage. Jimmy couldn't even hear how off-key he was. You're gonna get it all back tonight, i promise you. You know what you need? You need to sample the exotic cuisine of the far east. What do you say? Come on. I'm buying. Well, son of a gun. We're right on time. Here's somebody i want you to meet. Mr. white... This is guy Patterson. Hi. Sit down. Mr. white is with play-tone records. He just happened to be in town this week, and he caught the show this afternoon. Oh, great. Nevertheless, I think he wants to talk business with you. Well, I have heard your record, guy, and I like it. I like it a lot. That thing you do, you know, it's snappy. Yeah, snappy. It's a hit record. We'd like to release it. And add the one-ders... To the play-tone stable of artists. Just like that. Well, some papers will have to be signed, and you'll have to get me the master recording tapes, and you will have to say good-bye to Phil here. Wait. No. Phil's our manager. Not anymore. My bird-dogging is done. Play-tone's gonna take real good care of you. Uh, what if we don't wanna be with play-tone? I don't know, no offense. None taken. You want to stay in Pittsburgh and play to the three rivers crowd, Phil here is your man. No, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Guy... Play-tone has a show touring state fairs. This is the big time. The full bore. This is a rock 'n' roll tour that will feature the one-ders provided you quit sitting on your brain. We'd be on tour? Yeah! A tour? With other stars of the play-tone galaxy. I have to talk this over with the rest of the band. See what I mean? Smart. Very good. Next... this one-ders with the o-n-e... It doesn't work. It's confusing. From now on you boys will just be simply The Wonders. As in I wonder what happened to the o-neders? That's right. Play-tone will release the record nationally, but you'll be doing an awful lot of promoting as we go, so be prepared. All my only dreams is on the " b" side? Mm-hmm. We only got one take of that when we did that in church. Could we re-record that? I don't think so. I think it's great just the way it is. We are gonna get you some new clothes. Matching suits, nice suits. Nice, because you are nice boys. Except maybe for you. So when do we cut our next record? Touring is the priority, um, Jimmy. We're gonna meet up with the rest of the play-tone gang in Columbus as soon as possible. You'll be out on the road with them until labor day. Not me. Is this a mutiny already? No, see, um... Well, I joined the United States marine corps back at home. So, um... I have to report to south Carolina at the end of August, which means I have to leave the band at the end of August. But you will stay with the band until the end of August? Yes, sir. Ok, next, uh... Who is Faye? Uh... Faye's sort of, uh, like my girlfriend. Oh, that is so sweet. You want her on tour? She's your costume mistress. All right, boys, do better tonight than you did today. I'm gonna go up and have a chat with boss Vic kosslovitch, make sure your Mikes work this time. Ah! Guy... See what the worid looks like through those. And you... Percussionist foster Grant. Well, you're an adult, so go on. Go on off then and bang on your bongo drums as long as you like. It's for the summer, dad. I'll drop you a line. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. You do that. Tell mom I love her. I'll tell her. Well, mama, your son who loves you just left us in the lurch. Darlene, you just got promoted. You mean, you're gonna start paying me? I didn't say that. Oh, hi, folks. How're you doing today? Hey, isn't it about time you got going? Special moment for any recording artist. It's our record! Wow! Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Ooh! It's got a hole in it. It's got grooves. It's a play-tone record! Hey, you're missing somebody, guy. Where's your bass player? Oh, he went sniffing around the chantrellines' bus. Guess he's trying to get a glimpse. A big crush on them sirens. Diane Dane! Diane Dane! We love you.

Let's try maybe these. Thinner frames. Ok. Take those off. Put these on. Ok, look at me, guy. Look at me. These are hip? No. Something else. Try these on. Hide your cards. Sit down. Watch these guys.

Next weekend: The Beverly hillbillies. Ah, miss Elly may. Miss Elly may go skinny-dippin' in the cee-ment pond. Elly may. I love her. Inside, inside. Come on. Change of plans. We are leaving here just as soon as possible. That thing you do is the fastest-rising single in the history of the play-tone label. As of tomorrow morning, you wonders- you've got the number 7 record in the country. Aah! - Oh, my god! - Ohh! Ha ha ha! Watch the shelf. Look, state fairs are small potatoes. We are on a plane, flying to the coast... As long as we make the airport on time. - To California? - Disneyland? That's right. California. Number 7 this week. Number 1 next week. If we become number one, does that mean we get a gold record? 500,000 copies for a gold. Heyyyyy! Put your glasses on, shades. Give 'em what they want. Ha ha! Shades. The horses are coming. Where's the limo? All right, men, let's go! Ha ha! Cool! No, wait. I'm with them. Jimmy! Ladies, climb on top of the car with us! Hey, hold it! She's with us! Well, I like Wisconsin. Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hey, fancy meeting you here. That does not sound good. You feeling ok? No. No? It's cold in here, isn't it? No, you've got a fever. You're warm. Here, lie down. Just gotta bundle you up. Skitch, band meeting with herr play-tone. Ok. There you are. Now, sleep. No talking. We're winging our way to the coast. Mmm, California. Here we come. You know, Faye's not feeling very good. I wanna know when we'll get into a recording studio. First things first, fellas. You have to go off and pay homage to Mr. sol siler. He's the founder and chairman of play-tone records. What hotel are we staying at? It's the place Lucy and Ricky stayed when they came out with Fred and Ethel. And then we go into the studio? Exactly. 'Cause the point of all this is to make more records. What would you fellas think about making an appearance in a major motion picture? Whoa-ho-ho! What movie? Then, something very grand on the horizon, if I have worked the phones correctly- the Hollywood televisión showcase. Hmm? We are gonna be on TV. Man! Then after that, sometime, discmaster studios on sunset... We cut another record. Any questions, don't ask. I'm tired of talking to you, and I want to sleep. Lenny, give me that paper. Give me the paper. Lenny, why don't you go and see if you can visit the cockpit? Tell them it's your birthday. Go, go, go. Hey, rose. Hi, lamarr. I don't have any cash. Well, then charge it to your room, cherie. 2242. Excuse me. Ooh. And I'll send you up some soup, too. Oh, thank you. My name is lamarr, and this is my hotel, and we take care of people here. I'm Faye. Didn't I check you in with a quartet of gentlemen? And why aren't they here to take care of your needs? They're off making a major motion picture. Oh, we got movie stars in my hotel. They're musicians, actually. Even better. Whoo! Rick! Anita! The music stopped. Yeah. Keep playing. All right, Anita, i get the message. It's about time you noticed, Rick. Thanks, goofball. Sure thing, Anita sweetheart. Keep dancing, goofball. Now look out at the ocean. Say the line. We're being invaded! Run out of the shot! Playback! Playback! - Cut! - Cut! Cut! Cut! Print it! Excellent! Hey, guys, boots Randolph! Yeah! We look like a bunch of chimpanzees. No. We look like a rock 'n' roll band playing a rock 'n' roll song during weekend at party pier. We're not The Wonders right now. We're cap'n geech and the shrimp shack shooters. Hey, good news, fellas. You get to keep your wardrobe. Ha ha ha! Hey, do we have a top-10 record? You sure do. Then we shouldn't be here. Would you rather be back on that state fair tour? They're playing north Dakota this week. No, no, no. I vote for weekend at party pier. Smart man. You should have told us about this Rick and Anita movie. So mark that date- Saturday and Sunday, August 20th and 21 st, pacific car showroom. Just look for the kmpc hit caravan and me. I'll be out there signing autographs. If you want a picture of me in my official dodge boys rally team windbreaker, well, then I just might oblige. But hey! I got some exciting guests on my show today. Makers of a hit record, visitors from the east- oops! Hold on, giris. Not those mop-tops. Ha ha ha. No, I'm talking about America's own wonderful... wonders! Say hello, fellas! - Hi! - Hi! And here's their hit- a big L.A. fave rave at 10 minutes past 7:00 in the morning on kmpc... los ángeles! Thanks, guys. Just leave the headphones in there. That thing you do breaking my heart- let me ask you cats this question: Who were your influences? Which artists popped your cherry? The chantrellines. The chantrellines. Dion and the belmonts. Cap'n geech and the shrimp shack shooters. Uh... Stan getz- anything he did on the verve label... Bill Evans trío, ira Sullivan, Kenny durham, John young... Del Paxton. Yeah. Time to blow. My uncle gave me that record, and we played it in the high school band. Del Paxton in the high school band- that's wild. Yeah, we were pretty wild in erie, penn. There was this one time when we stayed up way past midnight, and... Smiling, smiling... Wait a minute, gigi. Hold on, hold on. Let's have the label right side up, shall we? Hey, how come you guys don't have long hair like the Beatles? Don't you guys like the Beatles? You, in the linettes, are those prescription, or are you just trying to look cool? Well, I am the drummer. Oh. Where the hell is solly? Sol siler is here! - Hooray! - All right! - Solly! - Hi, gigi! - Hey, solly! Billy, how you doing? Hey, Fran, is that you? How was acapulco, sol? Wonderful, wonderful. Did Mimi go with you, or did she have to stay home? She had the flu. Solly, how's your pals in the sheriff s department? You guys spend a little too much time in the wrong places. Solly, is it true don drysdale gave you a sock in the snooker? Old news, Fred. Old news. Business, gents. Got to take care of business. Wanna tell you about my new boys, The Wonders. Top-10 and fastest ever teen sensations. Caused the worst riot in Texas since oswald got shot. So, solly, saw you at chasen's with Suzanne pleshette. Quit with that. The wife works upstairs. Let's go have some deli. Lookin' good. What about the Dave Clark five? You think all this British beat stuff is new? Give us another month, we'll be invading them. Is that it? Yeah. I'll be sure to give him the message. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. How you doin'? Good. So, how long have you worked here at play-tone? How long you been wearing such tight pants? Wow, if that was a pick-up line, we're a match made in heaven. Excuse me, Mr. siler. James mattingly ii, lead singer ofThe Wonders. I wrote that thing you do. I wrote many other songs that I think we should make an appointment and share. What is Jimmy doing? Arrghh! Jimmy! What in the bloody hell is this? This is during my lunchtime? Yeah, like I got time on my hands- you wanna get Fabian away from me? He doesn't know who we are. To him, we could be anybody. He knows who The Wonders are. He didn't listen to any other songs? That guy hasn't even heard that thing you do. I don't think sol siler's the person who listens to songs. He's the guy who's in charge of the entire play-tone galaxy. This is the man who's in charge of our collective fate, our creative destiny. Oh... come on! Diane warned me about this. Diane Dane? Diane Dane. What'd she say? Never trust a label. And I'm beginning to believe her. Lenny: Oh, I agree. Come on, they put us up in a first-class hotel, all expenses paid while our record climbs the charts. Bunch of lying snakes. I'm sorry I'm bugging you. I guess I'm alone in my principles. Come on. There he goes, off to his room to write that hit song, alone /n my principles. Young squires, young squires. Faye, I'm glad to see you're feeling better. - Lenny, right? - Yeah. Listen, a major blonde in a major car just pulled up. I think she wants to show you the town. God! Great! Breath-good? No? All right. See you guys. Hold my calls. Listen, have you kids had dessert? Try the peach cobbler. Best in the southland. Hey, I got you some flowers. You gotta understand something aboutjimmy. His-his standards are way up there because he's so smart. He tested in high school at genius level, so that's why... I feel terrible. I'm gonna go back to bed. Yeah, that's a good idea. Bye, Faye. Bye. Thanks. - Ma'am. - Thank you. Ifjimmy's a genius... I'm u thant. Who's u thant? He's the secre- forget it. You wanna get out of here? Go see some of the coast? Yes, definitely. Or maybe, um... What's that theater that the, um- the movie stars put their hands in the front? Oh. Grauman's Chinese theater. That'd be fun. Excuse me, sirs. Um, I wanted to inform you that I'll be joining your ranks soon, and, um, I can already do 200 pushups. Really, boot? Yes, sir. Why don't you give us 100 right now? Yes, sir! Count 'em off. 3, 4... Coffee, please. Thank you. 5, 6... I like this kid. Louder, son! 9, 10, 11, 12... Hey, taxi, young squire? Um, yeah. Anybody calls for me, I'll be at chasen's with Suzanne pleshette. Gotcha. Hey, lamarr, is there any place around here with really good jazz? Oh, you want good jazz? Good jazz? Let me ask you a question. Who played coronet forjacques St. Claire on vital stats? Scotty McDonald. Get in the cab. Get in the cab! Take this young man to the blue spot. Oh, good jazz. They're fine! Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah! Yeah. I left Vancouver for Tacoma, Tacoma for Portland... Oh, I got married in Portland. Yeah. Oh, and then I left Portland for Reno, and then I got divorced in Reno. Then wised up and faced the inevitable. You know, I moved to L.A. Is the trío going on again? I don't know. Looks like they're kind of busy doing the cock 'n' bull with del there. Del? Yeah, del Paxton. One of the regulars. Roving hands, but good cock 'n' bull. Del Paxton. Mm-hmm. Del Paxton's sitting over there? Yeah. Gabby, ha ha ha! Oh, Gabby? He owes me money, man. Oh... oh, oh, my god. Oh, my god. Del Paxton is sitting over there. Oh, heh heh heh. I just lost you, didn't I? You wanna meet him? What? No... no. - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! - Ain't that the truth. - That's Gabby. Marguerite, what you got here? You may not believe this, del, but this kid has heard of you. That right? Well, sit down. Buy me a drink. Del Paxton. Who are you? I'm guy Patterson. I'm from erie, Pennsylvania. I'm in a band called The Wonders, and we're-we just cut a record, and we're out here on the coast, and I play the drums, and I have all your records. Well, not all of them, but a lot of them. At least I did until some of them got swiped when I was stationed in Germany, and you were playing in Germany at the time I was stationed there. But, you know what? I couldn't see you because you were playing in Hamburg and I was stationed in Munich. But I listen to your records, and I think you're great. You are my biggest fan. Heh heh. Thanks. I'll have another hennessey. A hennessey for del Paxton. All right. Ain't no way to keep a band together. Bands come and go. You got to keep on playin', no matter with who. You guys any good? Yeah. Yeah, man, we got- Jimmy and Lenny and me and... Faye- we got something snappy. Really think we do. I'm sure you do, but sooner or later, something makes you crazy: Money, women, the road. Hell, man, just time. Well, we've only been together for 2 months. Some bands I been with, that's 2 months too long. Last call, lovers. I'm gone. You keep on playin'... And watch your money. You'll land on your feet. Thanks for your hospitality. Thank you, del Paxton. Nice young man, huh, Marguerite? Oh, very nice young man, del. Good night. Night, Marguerite. Thank you, del! Just look at you. You're no good to me now. Lamarr: Taxi! Over here! Good morning, guy. We have a crisis here. Your bass player has disappeared, and you are still in bed! Just calling to tell you to get your patootie down to the televisión studio! You're gonna be on TV tonight! Excuse me! Excuse me! Hiya! Where's Lenny? Gettin' me a soda. Where's Jimmy? He the guy throwin' up in the bathroom? Holy cow! What's wrong with you? Hey, guy, I think- I think Faye gave me something. We're on TV in a few hours. I know! Hey, guy, what do you think of her? She was a playboy bunny! Took me up to her apartment last night, way up with the coyotes, where I did me some howling. Where's our bass player? Isn't he here? No. I gotta call the hotel. How far a drive is it to las Vegas? 'Cause I'm driving there tonight, through the desert with the top down. I'm in love, skitch! Freakin' stars in my head. Upchucking, Mr. hammerstein? Are you nervous about tonight's big live broadcast? Huh? Huhhhhhh? No. I've left 15 messages! Where the hell is he? Aaaah! Whooo! Yeah! Yeah! I don't know where he is, but he was joining the marines in August anyway. This was gonna happen sooner or later. Guy, say hello to wolfman, Mr. Scott pell. - How you doing? - Replacement? Yes. Who's he played with? The techniques... Uh, Roy Maxwell and the corsairs. Ha ha... Really? He's your new bass player. Mr. white, no offense... I- we've been together for a while. There aren't a lot of options here, guy. Can he handle our tune? I think I can handle it, junior. Ok. All right. Mr. white... Faye's not gonna miss this, is she? Oh, no. She'll be here. I've taken care of her. From the brand-new city of broadcasting in Santa Monica, California, it's the Hollywood televisión showcase! It's starting! It's starting! It's starting! Get in here! Oh, look, look! It's starting! It's not 10:00 yet. Canadian funnymen, Fletcher and o'shaughnessey! Astronaut Virgil "Gus" Grissom! Paul pope's primitive primates! Teen sensations The Wonders! Aaaaaah! Aaah! Oh, god, I'm scared! Give me the remote control. Give me the remote control. Hey, Mr. p, do you think guy got to meet Gus Grissom? Oh, man, wouldn't that be something if he met Gus Grissom? That's a good picture there now. Look at that. Nylon, and acrylon fibers. And now, here's the star of this week's showcase... Troy chesterfield! Thank you! All right now, everybody settle down. He won't be on for another half-hour. They got a bunch of other acts that come on before. Yeah. Last week, they had this elephant- oh, playing the harmonica! But seriously, Gus... What is it like flying up there in outer space in the-what is it- the gemini? That's right, Troy. It'll be called the gemini. See, I guess I'd have to say that flying in outer space is a lot like your working with Gina lollobrigida in your latest movie- it's out of this worid. Here's a question I have... Going back to one. How's the food? Go one! It's pretty good, Troy. NASA's working on new zero-g food all the time. - Take 2! - Like what? Well, just last week, I sampled a compressed Turkey product, processed succotash, and a packet of concentrated prune juice- oh... that's gotta hurt. Teen sensations The Wonders to the stage, please. Boys, we go. Teen sensations The Wonders to the stage. You look fabulous in the black suits- hi-fabulous in the black suits. I can just imagine guy backstage right now, just waiting to go on. You think they'll show a shot of him backstage, dear, waiting to go on? No, honey, they won't show him backstage. They'll show him when he comes out to perform. I wonder how many people are watching this. How many people saw the Beatles on the ed Sullivan show? Excuse me. Is that where The Wonders come out? Yeah, right there. Hey, skitch... How did we get here? I led you here, sir... For I am Spartacus. We're coming back! 5, 4, 3, 2... And now... For you kids, the latest rock 'n' roll group to challenge the Beatles to a hair-combing contest- that's just what we all need- the new teen sensations, The Wonders!

Even knew about the heartache I been goin' through well, I've tried and tried to forget you, girl but it's just so hard to do every time you do that thing you do I... Ready 4! We don't have to hurry this. Things you play slow move in. There's not a big hurry here. Not a big hurry. Nice and easy. That's a pretty shot. That a baby! That a baby! 'Cause we could be happy, can't you see? And knowin' that we... Quiet down! I'm trying to hear it! Ahh ahh to keep me here with you well, I've tried and tried to forget you, girl but it's just so hard to do doo-ooh every time you do that thing you do I don't ask around, girl I don't ask around... Supers coming up. It's time for America to meet The Wonders. Let's make 'em look good. Haven't got, girl and I just can't take it anymore... And go! Leo, there's a good-looking kid. And go! - Too scary. Go! Shades, that a baby. And go! Jimmy. Careful, giris, he's engaged. Congratulations, Jimmy. Hold it... Could be happy, can't you see? If you'd only let me be the one to hold you and keep you here with me 'cause it hurts me so just to see you go around with someone new new-ooh and if I know you you're doin' that thing every day, just doin' that thing I can't take you doin' that thing you do aaaaah! I'm doin' that thing for you, babe I'm lovin' I'm lovin' that thing you do oh, that's hilarious! Oh, thank you. Whoo hoo hoo! So, it just appeared... Like magic... For the whole worid to see. I didn't say anything. I was just as surprised as you. "Careful, giris, he's engaged." Am I supposed to buy you some diamond ring now? You're ruining this beautiful moment. Where'd you get the idea that we're engaged? We're not! That's the last thing i need in the worid. - We were great! What, are you kidding? You're kidding. You kidder. Hey, man, you have a couple of hundred bucks? I need some extra scratch for the craps tables. No. No? Come on! Just a little bit. This is my first trip to Vegas. Try guy. He's a sucker. Well, that was very nice. Whitey, can you spot me some Blackjack cash? That would be against my policy. Mr. white, it isn't true. Oh ho ho ho! Guy, can I borrow some money? 200 bucks. How much you want? Hah. Chump change. Good lord, Faye, you look gorgeous. Now, next up for you kids... You get to make another record. Can I say something? Hey, the fair Faye wishes to address us all, so it's... Jimmy... From now on, you stay away from me. I have wasted thousands and thousands of kisses on you. Kisses that I thought were special because of your lips and your smile and all your color and life. I used to think that was the real you when you smiled. But now I know that you don't mean any of it, and you just save it for all your songs. Shame on me for kissing you with my eyes closed so tight. Should've dumped you in Pittsburgh! Which one of you butts said we were engaged? The same person who said you had class, Jimmy. Let's blow, babe. Get that desert air in my hair. Ok. Do we really have to go with the top down? Take those stupid sunglasses off. Why couldn't you have dumped her in Pittsburgh? We do my songs, or we don't record anything. You got that, white? Ok.Jimmy. I was looking forward to working with you. You know, you're a liar, white! You're a liar. And you're in a tough spot, Jimmy, 'cause you didn't read the play-tone contract that you yourself signed, because it says you do what I say. And I say you cover these songs from the play-tone catalog. You record that thing you do in Spanish. You get one cut per side of the lp, but I don't want any of this lover's lament crap. I want something peppy, something happy, something up-tempo. I want something snappy. All right. I... I quit I quit I quit I quit, Mr. white. Jimmy just quit. Your band is falling apart, guy. Where's Lenny? I have no idea. I am so happy! Oh, I can't wait for tonight! Oh, yeah! Thanks so much. I really- thanks a lot! Thanks for being here! Thanks for sharing! Oh, wow, I'm really so happy. Well, I guess you don't need me today. Yeah. Wolfman, thank you very much. You're a good man, Scott pell. Give me a call later on in the week. We'll do something. I can't believe this. The Wonders are in breach of contract. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Mr. white. Well, don't worry. No one's going to prison, son. It's a very common tale. Well, maybe for you, but I was in a band, and we still have a hit record. Yeah, you do. One-hit wonders. It's a very common tale. My first time in a real recording studio. You want to hang around for a while? Ok by me. But you're out of the hotel this afternoon. Can't help that. You know, guy, Horace was right about you. You are the smart one. Lenny is the fool. Jimmy is... the talent. Faye is... Well, now, Faye is special, isn't she? And you are the smart one. That's what I think anyway. How you been? Doing all right. How about you? All right. Hanging in. What do you call that? / am Spartacus. Ha ha ha! You wanna lay it down? Nah. I was just goofing around. Hey, my man. Hey, del! What's your name again? Guy... uh, guy Patterson. Guy. Yeah, that's right. Hey, you're good. Oh, you heard that? Swing. Thank you. Uh, can I jam with you a bit? You want to jam with me? Why not? Sure. Sure. All right. What are you doing here? Recording some tracks in studio c with Willy Walker. Willy Walker? Can he jam with us, too? Nah, let's keep this a duet. Let's play that Spartacus again. Hey, Ernie... Roll tape on this. You got it, del. Go ahead. Count it off. 1...2... 3... 4. Hey! Yeah. I'll talk to you later. Hey, hey, hey. Slow down there, young squire. Life is long. I got to check out. Oh, you're leaving us today, too, huh? Yeah, well, that partner of yours- the one with all the attitude? He left here hours ago. And your little Fifi is about to vamoose as well. Wait, Fifi-you mean Faye. Is she still here? Yeah. She's sitting there in the coffee shop. At the counter. Alone. Now, where I come from, that just ain't right. Take that. Lamarr here. Yes, sir. Blue impala. Absolutely. Uh-huh. Thank you, sir. Hey, hey, hey! Now, that ain't your job. Del says I got the chops to make it as a drummer in L.A. - Oh. - So I think I'm gonna give it a try. Really? So, you're-you're gonna be a permanent west coaster? Yeah, it looks that way. Wow. So, what are you gonna do? Hmm... I'm gonna go back to erie. Figured that's what you'd say. Guy... Can I ask you a question? Shoot. Were you in love in erie? You know, I thought so. With that Tina woman? She wasn't right for you. Was she a good kisser? Yeah. Yeah? It would be ungentlemanly for me to elaborate. Gentlemen-i forgot what you fellas looked like. Well, sir... If you ever come back to erie, please stop by and see me. Right. We'll listen to records. That'd be nice. And here's good-bye. You know that none of this would have happened if you hadn't joined the band. And I mean that in a good way. Bye. So, young squire... Before you go... Let me ask you one question. Shoot. When was the last time you were decently kissed? I mean, truly, truly... Good and kissed? Dave gammelgard... New year's Eve... '61. Ok. Mm! Whoo. Whoo. We should have done that a long time ago. Yeah. Lamarr, would you mind watching our things?
