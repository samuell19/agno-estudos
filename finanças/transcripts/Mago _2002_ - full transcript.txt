MAGO The Age of Red Grapes Heartless slaughter, crimson blood of death, People turned into beasts from greed Ghastly shrieks of fading ghosts and this bloody sin-racked world. I shall draw my curtain. Block this crazy, bloody world from my room. I shall go into a world of my own I shall concentrate on only one thing To find my lady I don't understand Who are the women I see when I search for my lady? Are they hallucinations? Have my symptoms become worse? Hallucinations appear and disappear without trace. What do they have to do with me? It was not just in my room that the women appeared. When I was ten, I first rode in an escalator and on the subway and crouched with unfamiliar eyes among silent people. Even then, the dark silent people were trying to tell me something. You poor humans surviving on two bodies. You are prisoners of your bodies. Discard your primitive bodies and move into computer chips. Nothing is impossible. Transform your soul into information. Immortality shall be yours. May your cells become ripples everywhere; running, reproducing, and replicating, May true freedom be yours. May you all become cyber citizens. Run, you essence of desire. Crouching in your capsules of foam. Rush furiously into the arrogant circuit. Empty desire of dark shadows, fragments disintegrating in impatience and repression, Delicate nerve networks hang limp. Crimson whirlwinds of desire writhing in lust like Medusa's head. Run and rush. Run and rush. Dash and soar, rush ahead furiously. Toward the glamourous ovum up high Dash and soar, rush ahead furiously. Toward the glamourous ovum up high There is only one master of the world. Only the victor rules the world. You sperm of desire, trample on others to ascend. Toward the glamourous ovum... Only one of you, the victor can have his place in your Paradise. You cyber followers. You are all chasing after illusions that will disappear in vapor. A meaningless illusion... Futile efforts... The women appeared everywhere and tried to show me the cruel world for I had been trying to close the curtains on it. I implore you, departed spirits. Let me be. Let me be. But once again I was led by the hallucination I named Sky to hear the moans of another world filled with pain. The women in my hallucinations are always speaking out, crying, in the midst of all the pain for the world and myself to hear. I am weeping behind you. In the deformed back of polluted fish. In the heart of a black bird choking in oil waste. Please, let us breathe. Release the wire strangling me. Gripped by your brutal, blackish red hands. We are dying helplessly. Dying. Beneath apartment buildings filled with deep dark desire, ghosts are swaying in this crazy city and only the howls of vengeful spirits can be heard. Their mournful cries are heard from afar. The woman died in the polluted water. As I witnessed her death, I thought of the name Water Spirit. The Water Spirit is dead. The spirit who guarded the water. Maybe that is why I was able to clearly see the world she was dreaming of. The crystal clear water of the valley, the innocent people, and the world she was dreaming of. Maybe it was the home of innocence where they once lived and since forgot. My old memories Oh, where have they gone? I long for the old Mago Castle and the people of the sun. The hills and fields where we played, the Mago River's milky streams. I miss them all though they be forgotten in Moon Island where we dreamed of love. What do I yearn for now? When have I heard that familiar song? The Castle of Mago, the people of the sun, the milky streams, the Moon Island... It is strange. I feel all their joys and sorrows. The hallucinations, the spirits I see. What do their yearnings have to do with me? It is a strange thing. When I long for my lady I find myself looking at the spirits. What face will they show me today? Mother? You take on my mother's form today. The Age of Mago Castle's Yulryo Ever since I knew we were victims of atom bombs, I suffered from the fear that a bomb was always about to explode. I always heard the explosions. I must have been ten years old My symptoms got a little better and I went out for the first time. Ah! A new world spread before me. That's when I first saw the spirits. How can I describe the joy I felt? A picture is imprinted in my mind. A picture of a spirit running toward me over the field. She held out a red flower which became a flame in my young heart. That is why I came to call her the Fire Spirit. But the Fire Spirit watched me with uneasy eyes, predicting my deep wound. Mother!! Mother!! Mother! I'm sorry you have to see me this way. I will just rot away, but you... I saw her face for the first time. Never imagined it would be so horrible. I was scared Make a toast for this chilling hazy fete. Raise your glass filled with death. Despair ends in flight. Pour and drink you distorted souls. The blackish-red wine overflows and wets the living to the bone. Who indeed completes our emptiness? You thoughtless human beings! Everything you touch crumbles to destruction. Do you see your red blood trying to swallow up all life? Do you see your reddened tongue? I can't do this. I just can't. I can no longer let your flames play the music of destruction. The flame of life may go out. I cannot let human beings exploit you any longer. The last flame of light may go out. Life may be snuffed out. The Fire Spirit who had been close ended up... Maybe because the world races to destruction. Sky's dance is even more sincere today. Where will she take me today? I feel her guiding me carefully back through my childhood, to a past before my birth, to my previous life far back. I feel her guiding me carefully My yearning for the spirits grows stronger. I fall deeper into my memory. I begin to see the spirits. They are trying to tell me something. Look at the world first opening its eyes. How mysterious are the paths I touch. They turn into rivers and trees. They all long for you. If I listen carefully and open my heart the sound of life is within me. Now I know. And now I can feel the world full of you. It shall reach down with its soft touch. That is me. I shall make you breathe. You always shine new light on me. Until the day longing becomes a fragrance. I dream of waiting for you. For my love. I feel the desperate desire of the spirits to merge into one. Maybe it is because of their despair. If it were not an illusion I want to return to their world. That is to be expected. Would you believe? You were with us spirits once. I was with the spirits... Let us go down... to a past further back. That man is you. That was really me? That woman is the first woman, the 12 spirits merged in one body. We call her Mago. And you were the first man. We still feel it. Consummating with you was an amazing joy. We cannot forget the trembling moment. We were one as Mago, then scattered into the 12 spirits. Even when we had to live in silence, you were our strength. We felt your seed growing inside us spirits. When we were released from the long silence, we could to see the man we created. In the grass, the flowers, and all life, we trembled from endless joy. We could not see you anywhere, but we were happy knowing that you were wherever we were. The heavenly voice of Yulryo came out of the sky. People realized the laws of heaven. Nourishing oils flowed from the earth. Slaughter for food was unnecessary. Plants, animals and humans came together. Linked to each other, they were as one. All living things between sky and earth lived harmoniously together. The world produced a magnificent opera to the melody of Heaven's pipes. It is indeed a beautiful world. Was I really the first man who created all that life? The woman I have been searching for is Mago, the first woman, the mother of all life? When did it happen? When were the joyful spirits tainted with bloody pain? We are not sure exactly when. Probably from when people ate the forbidden red grapes. The people's blood became murky, blocking the Heavenly voice of Yulryo. The spirits lost their powers and the earth gradually dried up. I remember you raising your tired self in search of the light of innocence. We saw the dead Mago people strewn all over the black rocks. Yet we could do nothing. The 12 spirits had to leave, too. The place I am going to where even God's work is distorted, and the vast destiny cannot be avoided. I lie as a weary beast and the dawn light awakens me in the desert of death. The spirits dispersed into barren places unknown to each other. Ominous secret predictions. Gods who rule the world with hands of death. Everything you bestowed shall be resurrected in my heart as eternity. You wandered endlessly. Only death greeted you. The precious lives you created with Mago in love... You had to wander around fields laden with death. The oils stopped flowing and broke the balance of Yin and Yang. Only men gained power and brought in the age of violence and destruction. And my lady Mago? She also disappeared. The twelve spirits lost our powers and scattered separately for we could not return to Mago as one. So you are the incarnations of my lady Mago. Yes. Your suffering and bitter tears came down in black rain, turning the Castle of Mago into a desert. Mago! My lady! Solemn resentment was reflected in the dark sad eyes of the spirits and then turned into dust over and over again for years. The memory of parting became a deep wound as deep as time. A deep and secretive river of sadness began to flow within our hearts. Sadness is the seed of existence. The lifeforms we gave birth to all developed wombs. All things gave birth to generations all yearning without knowing. But life was short and turned back into foam. They were reborn as heartache and had to caress each other in shame as they tried to embrace their wounds. So many lives came and went. They would lie their weary bodies in the earth's womb. The spirits and you were born having inherited mankind's destiny. The Age of the Black Spirit I'm closing the doors. We've got enough good-looking girls. Do you know who they are? The Rain Spirit and the Wind Spirit. They cry and fall apart with mankind's rotten world. I'm buying! Drink up! Give it to me! The sky outside the window fills me with ecstasy. This hateful world is so strange I want to bite my tongue. When the prongs of darkness flash and fall on me I see the crazy light of your eyes. Marijuana takes over the wasted brain cells. Gloomy days of intoxication. Love in a bitter saliva-filled tunnel. How I miss the odor. You become the lethal poison. And the world locks you up in an enclosed solitary cell of addiction. Your eyes are blank from intoxication. Yet I know the world was poison for your innocent soul. Therefore, I love you. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Humans! You will never know! You will never know the confusion swirling inside you! You are being sucked into a deathly swamp, and what do you do? We can only watch. Watch and despair. Despair. Tell me one last time. Pray for us. You have nothing to say? My bleeding hand embracing you falls limp into death. Like our blood mixing together on the cold concrete ground. When we are reborn as innocent spirits past the horizon of extinction, our souls shall not be lonely, knowing that we are together. How I miss the memories of light. When light sounded in the distance, we had joyful light festivals. When the wind and rain spoke, the grass swayed in anticipation, the pipes of Heaven would sing. The spirits of beautiful life. Your warm embrace covered me. The enchanting spring of life. The spirits ran with me in each faded memory. My beloved people of light. What will you show me now? I don't want to see the spirits, the lives we created, suffering in pain anymore. Look. Some are happy. The Tree Spirit, the Shadow Spirit, and the Cloud Spirit. Let's drink it Today I fall at your axe. I die helplessly, helplessly. I'll be watching you merciless humans as a mass of meat in the butcher's. I will reel out and go homeward to Mago's native ground. Dragging my legs with no head and my torso with no legs. I will walk into the foggy streets of Seoul. You will see us search for Mago. The red, bare mountain is my bare bosom. We quiver under the cranes. Do you not feel it? Stop the hand of death. What are they doing to the Tree Spirit? That reeling woman is the Earth Spirit? The earth that was filled with the joy of life is now so dismal. I hear the sound of all life wailing in pain and sadness. I saw men with blank eyes. Sperm with sticky glances. I saw bullets sprout up like cotton. The mass of desire burning red. The skulls swelling bigger. The weak hands trembling on earth's deathly pale bed. This diseased world, diseased dreams, Old children kill themselves. My hand embracing you divides the air and your empty hand is mist within me. Who planted the seed of death in you? What has awoken within you? Destruction is light and uncontrollable, blaming you to the end. In your breath and in your body, can you not hear the bird's cry, the breeze, the black wind, the clamor of light, the cries of the plants? They are all dying. The Tree Spirit and the Earth Spirit, are being killed by men and cranes. The Moon Spirit is carrying a child whose genes have been engineered. My women are being trampled on and I can do nothing, I can only watch helplessly. While the whole world is dying... I watch your blood fall off my hands and flow into the moment of death. I am drawn into your eyes as they gaze at me in death. Ah! I love them. Your thin trembling lips. The trembling sadness burning in your flesh. Sensitive nerves crouching in your brain watch me. And I go to your soul as you watch me. You creep into my eyes, my nose, my rectum, and my pores. And I... I love you. The world is shedding tears of blood, and the men who are leading the world are becoming slaves of big red desire, dropping the world into turmoil and pain. Those red hands, the essence of desire. Everywhere they gather, they contaminate the earth. Citizens turn their backs, sneaking away, avoiding. Drink and pour. May orgies live on forever. The conscience of the era. The ones who will be patriots. The citizens keep their silence. Why the hell are you struggling so? What are you doing here in this accursed wasteland? Rotten water, rotten sky. Don't you hear? The funeral song of white birds is sad. It all over. It's the end of the world... It's the end. Only the cunning keep silent. Silence... The whistle of the wind, the screaming of birds, the painful outcries of lifeforms, the moaning of the world. I hear them in my heart. I am in pain. You know I atone for your sins. But do not think of worshipping me. There are too many gods in this world. Why are you climbing up here? Doesn't it smell? Isn't it cold? The Moon Spirit is being dragged off to give birth to an engineered child. Please, please... Why are you breeding me? I am not your guinea pig. Do you hear the suppressed cries of the genetically engineered child? One week past the due date, but it refuses to come out of the womb. Don't you see? It doesn't want to be born as an experimental animal. Stop it. Please don't force it out. It doesn't want to come out. Let it stay huddled up in my womb. Please... The Age of Light and Arirang Can you feel the rage of the spirits? Their enmity toward mankind is changing the spirits one by one. Even the animals and other life now feel like vengeful spirits. The vengeful spirits' revenge and their deathly fallout is falling over the world. Mago, my spirits. My women are turning into vengeful spirits... vengeful spirits... And I am helpless... Can I be only helpless? All raise your hands. We shall announce our declaration. All life is one and it is myself. All things, especially all life are equal with equal rights. Be it a microbe, a plant, or human. Therefore, we judge humans based upon this declaration. Judge the humans! Judge the humans! These men trampled on us and savagely killed us! Vengeful Spirits! Roast and cook these men and leave not one bone. These men contaminated the water and killed schools of fish. Drown them in waste water! Let their flesh rot off their bones and their polluted bones float around! Drown them! Drown them! These men blew away precious lives. An eye for an eye. Burn them to ashes! These men wielded their power, squandered millions a night and took pleasure in all! What filth! Roll them up in straw mats and beat them up! These men killed life for their experiments, manipulated genes, and produced deformed children. Use them as live experiments for AIDS, and exterminate all who have manipulated or destroyed our lives. An eye for an eye. They plowed through the mountains, destroying the environment, eating all that they heard was healthy. Bury them in the waste dump. Humans and spirits are all children of our love. The spirits are all part of Mago. We are all one family. What shall I do? Give me strength. Drown them! Drown them! Tell me, Sky. Is there no salvation for us? Go back far into your memory. To the deepest depths. Your previous life reaches far beyond your life as a human. It reaches to the Han People's Paradise where your father lives... Guide me, oh, Sky. I am already going down into my deep memory. Who is that woman in bright light? Mother? Mother, my poor mother... You have found your face. Where am I? Is this the Han People's Paradise, my father's country? Why are you silent? The woman I covet... Mother, why are you silent? Where is Father? Father, the Han who presides over the world. Why did you cast the curse of the red grapes on us? What did we do wrong? What love is my brush confessing? Mother! I loved my mother... Mago! Mago was my mother, I took Father's woman... That is why I brought on my Father's rage. Cursed Mago. The oils of the earth run dry. Rain falls once in a thousand years. Let the Castle of Mago turn into a desert. My children born from the seeds of sin. Dear Han. I shall reap the seeds I sowed. I give my everything. I give even my immortality to you. Empty, empty, all that is in me. Looking back, my empty heart is the wind and the water. All the lifeforms in the world feel like they are me. Everything looks new and I feel love. Yulryo's world, arirang, arariyo... Arirang, arariyo, arirang, arariyo
