How you doing, Mr. Black? How the fuck do you think I'm doing? Ha. Check, check, check. Fuckin' check! Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Black! That is... That is way too much excitement. Son of a bitch... I mean, this is all fun for you guys, but I gotta fuckin' work here! I'm thrilled to see you all out here this evening, I... I really didn't think that the audience that... I kind of... Am lucky enough to have... Gathered... Could afford Broadway prices. It really is... Nice that people are... Are actually coming out to see me now. I'm kind of... Well, I'm amazed and... And I... I am. And I... And I think it's terrific. But, you know, you bring your friends... And I don't really need them. You know, you and I have developed a relationship. I don't need these fuckin' strangers hanging around. You know, you... You spend... You know, you're... Two weeks... Before you see me, you go, "oh, you got to see this guy! He's really funny!" How do you think that makes me feel? That puts a lot of goddamn pressure on me. Because if I'm not funny, you're fucked! It was a really special winter, wasn't it? If you're a fuckin' moose! If you got fur on your nuts, it's been a fuckin' festival. It was the coldest winter ever! I thought last winter was the coldest winter ever. But I was fuckin' wrong, wasn't I? You see, because I travel all the time. So last winter I'd be in the Midwest and the blizzard would hit. And then I'd fly home, and the blizzard would hit again! But it has been... Way too cold this winter on the east coast. I mean it's un... The, the, the... The temperatures have been ungodly! Where the fuck is global warming when you need it?! I think the people of this city should literally every day have been on the streets with aerosol cans. Nobody should have to live like this. And even if they hadn't told me, I would've known it was the coldest winter ever. Because I have not had one thought. I have not been able to complete a sentence in my own head. I find myself walking around going, "you know what I should really... Fuck it's cold!" We don't need to live like this. I had a tremendous idea. A way to change the climate. And we had the money to do it. Just a few years ago, our country had the largest surplus ever, two trillion dollars. And now, just a few years later, we have the largest deficit ever, three and a half trillion dollars. That means we went through five and a half trillion dollars in just a few years and nobody explained where the fuck it went! If we actually went through five and a half trillion dollars, you know what? Each one of us should have gotten a goddamn coupon. For shoes or a coat or whatever you need. So, the federal government decided the way to make this money up was to have a 350 billion dollar tax cut. Okay? And by the federal government, I mean republicans and democrats working together. And the only thing dumber than a republican or a democrat is when these pricks work together. We have a two-party system. The democratic party, which is a party of no ideas. And the republican party, which is a party of bad ideas. And the way it works is... The republican stands up in congress and goes, "I got a really bad idea!" And the democrat says, "and I can make it shittier." These guys believe that a 350 billion dollar tax cut will stimulate the economy. And they're full of shit! Because they don't know what stimulates the economy. The economy goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down. Nobody knows why the fuck it happens. And I know this... Because I took economics. And I'd explain it to you, but I flunked that course. It's not my fault. They taught it at eight o'clock in the morning. And... And there... Is absolutely nothing that you can learn out of one bloodshot eye. After I flunked the first two tests, I grabbed the professor by the throat and I said, "why you teaching this shit at this ungodly hour? Are you trying to keep this stuff a secret?" So they come up with a 350 billion dollar tax cut... At a time in which every city and every state that I've been through is broke. Is broke! And you're gonna cut taxes. They're so broke that they've actually cut essential services. In many places, they've cut policemen 'cause... Who the fuck needs them? Or firemen. Son of a bitch, it's much more fun watching something burn down. In our city, New York, they cut after-school programming. And if anybody needs to be distracted, it's those little pricks. So I said, "you know if you're gonna cut" "after-school programming, it seems to me the least "you could do is give each one of those kids a knife. "And they could whittle. "They could whittle. And sell their crafts at the fair." But... But if you're a parent, hold onto your hats. The federal government is gonna give you $400 for each child you have. So if you've got 1,000 kids, you're on fuckin' easy street. You might want to start adopting 50 at a time. Just pick some up off the street and take them home with you. $400. That's the... That's where you go, "what... What's the federal government thinking?" I mean what... What, what do... What do congressmen's children eat? Mites? All $400 does is remind you how fucked you are. You would have been better off if your congressman just came to your door and pissed on your foot. It's a dollar a day. One dollar a day. Um... You know, you know how to stretch that kind of money? Put your kid in a box and send him off to a Sally Struthers country where a dollar goes a long fuckin' way! And he can have all the dried milk he can choke down. And at... And at the end of the year, you've got $35.00 left over. So at Christmas, you can give your kid two nice boxes of shit. See, what I think... You logically do with the 350... Instead of having a 350 billion dollar tax cut, what you do with that money is do a public works project. See, what that is... Is you pay a lot of people... To build something. Okay? And that way you employ people who are unemployed. And... And then they get money, and they spend it. And that stimulates the fucking economy too! See, you pick a place that really needs something. You know a state that could really use it, like... Mississippi. Of course Mississippi. Because that's the place that no one has ever thought, "boy, I got a vacation. I need two weeks in Biloxi." And you go down there and you find a place that's totally in the shitter. You won't have to go far. And what you do is build a big fuckin' thing. I don't care what it is as long as it's big and it's a fuckin' thing. And then the economy will explode, because people will say, "I gotta see the big fuckin' thing." And then there'll be a big fuckin' thing restaurant, a big fuckin' thing hotel and casino. A big fuckin' thing spa! See, what... What I felt they should have done... For our first public works project... Is build a giant wall... Across the entire border of Canada. Because that's where the cold air comes from. I got to... Travel a lot this year. I got to get out of the country, which was... Which was really great. And, you know... It would have been nice if... If our president, when he was young, had had some intellectual fuckin' curiosity and he'd gotten out of the country too. I was shocked to discover that he never even went to Canada. How's that possible? Even drunk on a bet you make it to Canada. I got to Italy. I'd never been there, it's extraordinary. If you've not gone, unbelievable. I didn't know this, but Jesus Christ is... Woo hoo, he's big there. Everywhere I turn there's Jesus, there's Jesus, there's Jesus, there's Jesus, there's Jesus. He is like the coca cola of Italy. And I'm jewish, and I have to say after three weeks there, I started to think he might be the real thing. I went to New Zealand... This year, and... Man... I know a lot of people want to go there. But let me just tell you, it's 22 hours by plane. So if you have the opportunity... Don't. You don't want to be on a plane for more than eight hours. 22 hours is like a stress test that's out of control. You're locked in there, the treadmill's going, you got wires everywhere. "Where's the fuckin's nurse, where's the fuckin' nurse?!" You want to know what it's like to be on a plane for 22 hours? Go home. Sit in a chair. And squeeze your head as hard as you can. Don't stop. Don't fuckin' stop. Then take a paper bag and put it over your mouth and nose... And breathe your own air over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Now they say... You know, that you should fly first class. Well, that doesn't fuckin' help. So the chair is comfortable, you're still squeezing the fuck out of your head. And if you're in coach... Kill yourself. What you want to do... Is when you finally have snapped, walk back to one of the bathrooms... Go in, put your head in the toilet and flush it. The suction is such that your head'll be ripped right off. Because you're better off... Literally traveling with your head in toilet water than spending more than eight or nine hours in coach. Who do you think designed... This... The coach seats on an airplane? I think it's a guy with scoliosis who was really pissed. "Goddamn it, this is the most comfortable chair ever. "I don't know what they're bitchin' about. This is perfect." But what they should do... I think just take all the coach seats out of the planes and give everybody a five foot stick. That way you can sit wherever you want. You just take it, shove it up your ass, spin around. When you get bored then after 12 hours you can just beat the shit out of each other. The airlines try to distract you. They bring you food, food, liquor, liquor, food, liquor, liquor, food, food. Cognac. They offered me cognac. I don't even drink cognac, so I said, "fire that son of a bitch up and throw it at my head." Then they show you a movie. Then they show you another movie. And when all that's done, there's still 14 hours to fuckin' go! If the people... Of New Zealand... Want to be a part... Of our world, I believe they should hop off their islands and push them closer. Now... They say that New Zealand is beautiful, and I do not know. Because after 22 hours on a plane, any land mass would be beautiful. We could've landed on a tiny iceberg, and there could have been just two penguins blowing each other and I would have been thrilled to see them. And I would have performed. The most important part of travel is when you come home. Because that's when you see your country with new eyes. I was amazed to realize that we are... We are the only country that... That tells the rest of the world, on a nearly constant basis, that we are the greatest country on earth. And that is a little fuckin' obnoxious. And I know it's obnoxious... Because if you were in an office and there was someone there who came in every day and said, "I'm the greatest fucker here! "And you sniveling shits would die without me! Ah-ha-ha-ha!" I can guarantee by the end of the week... You would've killed him and eaten him just to try to possess his power. The amazing thing is there are people who've never left this country who talk about the fact that we're the greatest country on earth. How fuckin' dumb is that? 'Cause you don't know. If you haven't left here, you don't know. There are countries that may be giving shit away every day. Canada's one of those countries. You know what they give away? Health insurance! And we don't have national health insurance. And if any country needs it, this one does. Because this country is more obsessed about its health than any other country on earth. We're completely obsessed about our health. We're obsessed so much about our health that we worry about it. And when you worry about your health, you're fucking gonna get sick, aren't you? I flew back from... From Los Angeles. And on the plane was a "time" magazine. And there was a 30-page article about diabetes. And I read every page. And by the time that plane landed, I had diabetes. And for all we study about health, we know nothing. Is milk good or bad? I rest my case. You don't know. You don't know anymore. And a lot of you were sitting there thinking, "fuck, I'm an adult. I don't have to drink that shit anymore." When I was a kid, you knew milk was good. Because there was only one kind of milk. Moo cow fuck milk and that was it. And you had to drink four glasses a day. Now you don't know. Because when you go down the... The aisle of the grocery store, the... There's milk... The milk aisle goes on for fuckin' ever. There's one percent, two percent, low fat, skim, acidophilus milk. What the fuck are you talking about? Acidophilus milk? Milk doesn't need a friend. That shit belongs in the yogurt section. Lactose intolerant milk? Kiss my dick. If you're lactose intolerant, you can't drink milk. So what's in the fuckin' carton? Get it out of there. Get it away from my milk. It is talking to my milk and making it feel bad about itself. Soy... Milk. Beyond belief. I was... In Los Angeles and I... I ordered some coffee, and they said, "would you like..." "Whole milk... Skim milk or soy milk." And my fist stopped right in his face. There's no such thing as soy milk. It's soy juice. But they couldn't sell soy juice. So they called it soy milk. Because anytime you say soy juice, you actually start to gag. And they put soy milk in with my moo cow fuck milk. And it doesn't belong there, because we all know there's no soy milk because there's no soy titty, is there? We care so much about health... That during the last 25 years we destroyed water. Because when I was a child, this was the simplest thing of all, this was the essence of life. And when you were thirsty... That's the operative word, ladies and gentlemen. The word is and has and will always be thirsty. Not hydrate. They made that fuckin' word up. I could go anywhere in my house when I was a child. You know that... There was three or four different rooms. I could go into my basement, and I could get clean water and drink it. And then go back out and play. And those were great times. But then... Then we decided... Every town and every village which had the... Water coming to it and all they had to do was clean it said, "we'll save money. "We won't clean the water so much. "And with the money we can save, we can then buy the water at the supermarket." Try to go through this logic with me. Our country... Had water... Coming to our homes. And even if we were locked out, we could still get it. Clean water. And we said, "no, fuck you! "I don't want it to be that goddamned convenient. "I want to drive and drive and drive and look for water, like my ancestors did." So we now buy water from Coke and Pepsi. Because when I think clean water, oh yeah, I fuckin' think Coke and Pepsi. The water that they sell is actually so shitty they won't put it in Coke and Pepsi. And that's not funny, because it's fuckin' probably true. Aquafina? I think it means "the end of water as we know it." Then there's spring water. All sorts of spring waters. Deer park, which I don't touch because there's a picture of a deer, and you don't need a deer pissin' and shittin' in your water. There's all sorts of spring waters. It's bullshit. Because nobody's ever seen a spring. Nobody's ever fuckin' seen a spring. There's no such thing. Fuck, when was the last time you said, "boy, I can't wait to go to a bottling plant."? You know where spring water comes from? There's a couple in Pittsburgh that sits in a bathtub and fills these fuckers up. Because that's how stupid they think we are. They think we're so stupid that on many bottles of spring water they print the nutritional facts. The nutritional facts of water! How dumb do they think we are? It's as if they believe that we fell asleep on a nuclear reactor, and our brains had melted. And we are now nothing more than meat with eyes. "I wonder how many calories are on water? Let me look!" Total fat. Total fuck fat in water. What that implies is that there's water with chunks of fat in it. And I got to find that water 'cause that's the tasty goddamned water. And if that weren't enough they print next to the... To the... To the calories and the total fat, all of the zeroes that are there, they print the percent of our daily requirement. If they think we're that stupid, the labels on... On spring water should just be written in crayon. With the "r" reversed and a finger like this. When I was a kid, and water was free, nobody ever told you how much water to drink. Ever. Four glasses of milk, nothing about water. But then they started bottling water. And as soon as they started bottling it, they said, "eight bottles a day." Eight! Eight, you fuckers! That's like a goddamned homework assignment. I can't remember what day it is. Now I got to remember how many bottles of water I drank? Fuck you! That's 56 bottles of water a week. You need a burro to carry that much shit around. And if you don't drink 56 bottles of water a week, many doctors say at the end of the week you should take the garden hose and shove it up your ass. Here's the kicker. You're gonna love this. Scientists have begun to experiment to find out the effects of water on our system. And guess what? We're probably drinking too much water. And by the sound of your reaction, I realize that some of you are fucked! You been scarfin' this shit down. You been yellin', "look at me, look at me. My pee has no color." That's because you've pissed all the nutrients in your brain away, and you're lucky your head hasn't caved in. There are people... Who walk out of their apartments... In New York city... Every morning... Of every work week... Carrying a liter bottle of water in a sling as if it was a little baby. They're carrying a liter bottle of water with them, as if they were crossing the goddamned Mojave! "What if I never see water again?" The bottom line is, is that... Nobody knows. Nobody knows shit about health. I know this because there was an article written a few years ago about a gentleman living in the Bronx. The oldest man living in New York, 115 years old. Living by himself. Having no health problems. Getting around without any trouble whatsoever. Mentally clear. And they asked him what his diet was. And he said that from the ages of 90 to 115, he'd narrowed his diet down. And it now consisted of bread fried in fat back. And three gallons of Thunderbird wine a week. When they asked him... Why he didn't fry his bread in bacon, he said, "because bacon's too lean!" Imagine if he went to a doctor. Guy had been doing tremendously, and if he sat there and described his... His diet, the doctor would have gone, "what the fuck's the matter with you? "You can't eat that anymore. You have to start on a diet of fruits and vegetables." And he would've. And he'd have been dead in a week! 'Cause they don't know. They try to come up with these general rules of health. And they can't do it, it's impossible to do. Because everybody's health is different. What's good for one of you will kill the person sitting next to you. Every one of you has a health that is unique and totally different from everybody else. Completely. Because we... Are all like snowflakes. I've thought of two general rules of health. And I think these actually work. The first is... The good die young, but pricks live forever. So if you want to increase your longevity, if there's a kid who lives across the street, whenever you see him, run outside and go, "get out of here, you little shit!" And it'll be just like taking vitamins. The second is... If you masturbate 20 times a day, you'll never make it out your front door. You might make it to the door, but when you squeeze the handle you'll pass out. And let me just say that I did that experiment in my own lab, wearing a white lab coat with a rectal thermometer in my pocket. Now for women, my belief is it's probably 30 times a day, but I can't find a woman to come to my lab! We have a... Health issue that still looms in front of us. It's extraordinary that it does, but the fact is, is there could still be a smallpox epidemic in this country. And the reason for that is, is that the vaccines that we were given, and I was told was gonna last forever, wore the fuck off. And they waited until a possible emergency condition to tell us. That's as if you went to a public bathroom, flushed the toilet and the water just hits you in the face. And as you left, on the door, as you're leaving, it said, "danger, water may hit you in the face." I can't believe it wore off... And they didn't tell us. Because that means my whole life has been a delusion. Because every day I'd wake up and I'd go, "well... It's gonna suck today, but at least I'm not getting smallpox." If I get smallpox, I will file suit against my government, because they took me out of a very important class... To get that vaccine. And if I had taken that class, I wouldn't have to do this bullshit for a living. I'd have a real job like with Worldcom or Enron or Tyco. Global crossing. Adelphia. Or any of those wonderful, wonderful businesses that did so much to inspire us to invest in the stock market. The people who ran these companies are the greediest group of fuckers ever. There's... I know this, because we have a lot of greedy people in this country. And the greediest of the greedy saw what these guys did and went, "wow, that's really fucking greedy. I wish I'd thought of it." Father and two sons run adelphia. It's a cable company. And they take from the company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people. Three people took a billion dollars. A billion. What were they gonna do, start their own space program?! "Let's send a monkey to mars, dad." If that weren't enough, they took 13 million dollars of company money and used it to build a golf course in their own backyard. What amazes me is the people who worked for that company and knew that they did it, that they didn't rise as one and slay them. I've never understood why the people of France chopped off Marie Antoinette's head. Now I fuckin' get it! Then, of course... There's Dennis Koslowski. He took from his company 463 million dollars because, well, he had to buy shit. Are you kidding me? He gets on the phone, "I'd like all the corn in Iowa, 'cause I'm having a hoe down." Dennis spent $16,000.00 on an umbrella stand. I will repeat that, my gentle snowflakes. He... A guy, it's a guy, it's a guy, not even... Not even fruity, it's a guy, spent $16,000.00 on an umbrella stand. None of us... None of us would do that, because we have an umbrella stand where we live and we call it a bathtub. My parents spent $16,000.00 on a used car. You could put a lot of umbrellas in there. Or you could drive to where it isn't raining. Now... When you spend $16,000.00 on an umbrella stand, it has got to be made out of something that's very special. So that you say to yourself, "I must possess this. No one else shall own it." And I think it was probably made out of Martha Stewart's vagina. I can tell some of you are shocked, 'cause you didn't know she had one. But she does, and I heard it goes with any decor. I think... These greedy fuckers who ran these companies should have been put into insane asylums... For 20 years... Minimum, where they should be forced to sit next to someone who's crocheting something that isn't there. I was wondering what I would do... If I had 463 million dollars. Because what these guys did they just bought stuff. That's what they did. They acquired things. In order to one-up each other. That's, in part, why it got out of control. They... They bought things. How many things can you buy? How much shit do you need? They bought art, a lot of it they didn't look at. They bought car after car after car, you know, some of them which they didn't even drive. They bought three, four and five homes and redecorated them. And they got a tax write-off, and I'd have a joke for that, but I'm not that fuckin' funny! I don't believe you one-up people by buying something bigger. Or... That's not the way it works. If you really wanna shake somebody up and you wanna fuck with them and... What you do is you be creative. You use that money in a way that these idiots could never imagine. You know what I would have done with that money? I would have hired a young girl in her early 20s. I would have paid her a remarkable salary. Um, I would give her the best pension and benefits that money could buy. I'd give her health insurance. And she would be my personal... Ball-washer. You know... You know what? I can sense some of you pulling away from me. And all I can tell you... Is that... I came a long way just to share a dream with you. There's nothing sexual about this. I think if you're an important person and you want to show off to other important people what would be better than having a woman walk in front of you rinsing and scrubbing, rinsing and scrubbing. Scrub, scrub, rinse, rinse. Scrub, scrub, rinse, rinse. Because I am an important C.E.O. And my nuts should be clean. And then the other C.E.O.'s would gather and they'd go, "who's that?" Who's that? That, my friends, is my very esteemed personal ball-washer. What did you guys buy? Another car? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! But there is good news. I know that we all feel a lot safer now that homeland security is in place. I know that every day you wake up going, "goddamn it, nothing's gonna happen." It's unbelievable. Homeland security is a problem because... It's a good idea, but it's a problem because the man who runs it is tom ridge. And he is someone who has the leadership qualities of a gerbil. He was a part of coming up with what is the color coding system of security. You know, orange and yellow and whatever the fuck the others are. Okay... And what's stupid about it is they have the color coding like we're in fucking elementary school! There's no need for that. Because every time they tell us what the color is then they have to fucking explain it. So get rid of the fucking color. Simplify it. There should be three levels of security. Jesus Christ. Goddamn it. Fuck me. You see, I thought the color coding meant that was the color clothes you were supposed to wear that day. And that way we could find out who the enemy was. I'll never forget the first time we went to code orange. Tom ridge came on television to speak to the American people. His job, really, as the leader is to keep us calm. "I know this is a terrifying time," he should have said, "but everything's gonna be alright." "Just keep your... "Keep alert. We're gonna pull through this together." And what did tom do? He came out and he went, "we're fucked, we're fucked! "I don't know what's gonna happen. "There're gonna be giant ticks everywhere. "We don't know. Run, scurry, flee, flee." But in case of a chemical attack, be absolutely sure that you have duct tape... And lots and lots of water. Our government... Told us... That we could protect ourselves from a chemical fuck attack with duct tape. The only way duct tape protects you from a chemical attack is if you have enough that you could wrap it around yourself and suffocate before the chemicals killed you. As soon as... As soon as they told us that we should protect ourselves with duct tape, immediately a group of citizens should have been sent to Washington on our behalf. And they should have taken everyone, from the president on down, out for an afternoon of electro-shock. Just to get them back on track. Just to get them back on track. I'm always amazed when... When I hear people saying, "that George Bush, he's a great leader." And I wonder, "where can one find a drug that would make one so delusional?" But, you know, I had the exact same reaction when somebody tells me that they think Bill Clinton is a great leader. It's beyond belief to me. It's extraordinary. These, these... These guys... I will tell you this. If you are inspired by either George Bush or Bill Clinton, then you were probably inspired by your high school principal. I'll tell you why Clinton and Bush aren't great leaders, okay? It's simple. Neither of them took responsibility for fuckin' anything. None of them. They're unbe-fuckin-lievable. They pull shit and then they go, "well, I don't... fuck." They are exactly the same group of assholes that when I was a kid told me in case of a nuclear attack to hide under my desk. And the... and... And bush and our leaders now have no memory. They keep going, "oh, this is the most terrifying time ever." Fuck you! That time was pretty fucking scary. You know what they would do? They would come to my elementary school with... With films to show me how to protect myself from a nuclear fuck holocaust. They would show this giant nuclear fuckin' bomb just blowing the shit out of everything. Goats and monkeys flying everywhere. The windows of the elementary school blown out. The teacher banged up against the fuckin' blackboard. But... There were the children... Hiding safely under their desks. Writing poetry, playing guitar. Every two weeks, when I was nine, my elementary school would have an air raid drill. I guess to remind me I could die at any minute. So I'd go hide under my desk, put my hands over my head and look at my penis and say, "goodbye, old fella." And we'd just become friends. And I'm sitting there thinking, "the adults in the community have said that I could protect myself "from a fire-fuck-ball by hiding under wood." I'm hiding under kindling. Maybe I can get some sticks so I can burn faster! And I thought, "wow, if this was a real attack", when the "all clear" sounded, I could get up and go out to the playground and melt! So why was I surprised... When our leaders... Couldn't find the weapons of mass destruction? They couldn't find them. Nobody could find them. And nobody takes responsibility. Are you fucking kidding me? If that's the case then, you know, make me the head of the C.I.A. Because I can watch TV and guess with the best of them. I believe that the C.I.A. Is truly filled with frustrated weathermen. How is there no accountability? How is that fuckin' possible? They failed on a massive fuckin' level, and there's nobody... Nobody's taking responsibility?! Are you fuckin' kidding me?! If you had somebody who you worked with who just fucked up like these idiots did, they'd be gone! What if I came out here tonight and I said, "I'm not really a comic, I'm a magician." "Watch me make this rabbit disappear." And then I'd just rip the fur off of it. Close enough, fuckers! You'd go and ask for your money back or you'd need psychiatric care. If they couldn't find the weapons... Which were the... The reason we went to war... Then why... Didn't they make something up? Why did they stop lying? My government has always lied to me. I'm comfortable with that. Son of a bitch! What's so tough? They could have done it simply. Just send two kids to Kinko's. "I need a picture of a camel with a nuclear weapon on its back." Thank you. Goodnight, guys, safe home.
