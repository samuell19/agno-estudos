Kuznetsov - ROMAN BORISOVOV GROMADSKY... LENINGRAD METRONOME The First Film The fact that in in the second week of September 1941, the blockade was baptised "Leningrad's Ring." The name "ring" is literally not appropriate; It was three huge circles. One from the shores of the Gulf of Finland to the western shore of Lake Ladoga. The other from the south-western shore of the Gulf of Finland north-east to Peterhof Petrodvorec. And the third, the longest arc, on the southern edge of Leningrad that starts at Forel Hospital, and ran interrupted on the south-western shore of Lake Ladoga, then opposite the lake, south-east, and continued beyond the coast. There was only one water corridor left that connected Leningrad with the rest of the country, along the southern shore of Lake Ladoga. This passage was only 60 km wide. But still the "Way of Life" - as it was then called, symbolised the constant exposure to air strikes, bombings, and the long-range German cannon fire just like Leningrad itself. SAVE THEM! DEFEND THE CITY OF LENIN Commander of the artillery! Zhdanov. Please prepare for a massive attack with all kinds of long-range weapons and shoot at the enemy points from where the city are fired! Immediately! Andrej Alexandrovich, we have reached the limit of the number of bullets that can be consumed today. Andrei Alexandrovich, can you hear me? Well, how are you? Better, thank you. During these hours on the Eastern Front again, extra-ordinary events happen. I didn't talk to you about the beginning of the war. I'm just talking about it today, because today I can definitely say, our enemy was defeated and he can never get back on his feet! Moscow's fate is decided! Heil! Heil! Heil! What are your orders, Comrade Stalin? Get the staff of the Western Front to immediately start to thoroughly study situation and call from there at any time of the day. Yes, sir! What happened? Revaz Bakanidze has contacted you several times. - Who? - He says you've known him for a long time, he wants to meet you. He is in transit in Moscow. Revaz Bakanidze? - Good afternoon, Comrade Stalin. - Hi, Rezo. Hi, Koba. Long time no see. - A long time ago... - Yes. 15 years ago. With me... for dinner? Or do we have breakfast now? Are you hungry? I have to be at the Belarusian railway station in 40 minutes. The composition of the train of my division begins. - Are you a division Commander? - No, I'm a Commissar. Let's sit down. Married? How is your wife? Keto died in '29. Oh, well..., Long time no see. Your son? - I know you had a son? - He's dead. He was called up in the first days of the war. He fell at Leningrad. I remember him... ... he was still very small. - And yours? How is Yakov? Yakov is not. Certainly, he died too. Don't hurry, you will get there in time. Say, Commissar... What do your soldiers think? And what do you think? About what's happening. We believe in you, Koba. You. At the party. But still... I want to ask you something. - Are the Germans close to Moscow? - Yes. And with very great forces. And at Leningrad? They are... 4 km from the Kirov plant. If we don't break the blockade as soon as possible, the city will starve. - And in the south? The Donetsk Basin. Do you still have questions? Yes, there is more. In another situation, I would hesitate for a long time before I ask but if I left without asking, I would look like a coward in front of you. Answer me please. How could all this happen? I would like to ask, as a man to a man, as a friend to a friend, as a communist to a communist. Do you have a cigarette? Just stay. Are you aware... what forces are on our shoulders? I'll tell you everything now. According to our intelligence... at least 190 German battle-hardened divisions - with gained war experience in Europe - are fighting against us armed with... 5 thousand aircraft, in addition to 4 thousand tanks. - And we? - Less, much less. - But why? Why? You know how the defence grew in our industry in the pre-war years? Of course not. This is confidential information. Yes, it was, but now it's no secret. 39%! Every year! - Enough? - Sounds little. Enough? More than two and a half thousand new aircraft and all this in the first half of this year. Do you think that means little? Compared to what? To the Germans, for whom the whole of Europe produce? Answer, Commissar. Answer, I want to hear your answer. - Our history seems to have doomed us to failure. - No! Our history is for us, not against us! No other country in the world have withstood a blow like the one that hit the Soviet Union! But we survived! I understand. But why, can you explain? Why is that in the war, which we prepare for every time, we do suddenly collapse like an avalanche? We have endured such losses more than once. An attacker always has an advantage, the surprise. We've done everything we can, Rezo. Almost everything... Hand... mistakes must be acknowledged. There have been so many reports that Hitler is not attacking us now, but in a year or two. It would have been hard to believe that Hitler... decide to start a two-front war. But the fact, the fact... We made a mistake in our calculations. But before we tell people that, we have to... defeat the enemy. And for that, we have to have strength. You got it! You're hoping for our reserves, Koba. My division was formed in the Urals, and I saw... It's not just that! The Germans wouldn't be able to keep up continuous attacks for long. Our soldiers are fighting bravely! Very bravely. But not only in this war the number of people decides it is a war of machines. We need weapons. Lots of weapons! And if it happens...! Then there will be a turn! - Until then... - I understand. We have to persevere until then. And one last question, Koba. We will never give up Moscow, will we? We can't allow that, no way! About 3 million people live in Leningrad today. The evacuation, Andrei Alexandrovich, as you know, was done quite intensively. We managed to get inside the country with 282 train-sets, to evacuate 636 303 people. - To few! Forgivably to few. But the Leningradians resisted the eviction, they didn't want to leave their home town. Many also fled to the Baltic Sea. Now is not the time to self-justify. Comrade Kuznetsov, what's going on in Ladoga? Continuous storm, not to mention enemy cannon-fire, bombings. Yesterday, the Germans again sunk two barges with flours. What is our food supply Stock? According to the norm in force - it is enough for the city for 2 weeks, for a maximum of 3 weeks. The bread is baked with various additives, with soy flour and feed flour. If the blockade of the city continues, the situation can become very dangerous. We need even more strictly check the release of each kilogram. No... every gram of food. With all the severity of the war, speculators must be punished, and looters too. We need to gain time. To your knowledge, for how long do you think St. Petersburg can withstand the blockade? I didn't understand well, Führer. Are you interested in the food supply of the city? I think they have for a few days, maybe for a week. I think with the complete blockade... A complete blockade doesn't exist! If you think so, one could supply St. Petersburg by air or sea... - Exactly! For them, this is not a blockade! No! It's just fiction! Holders of a huge army near St. Petersburg, and the Bolsheviks calmly provide their care on Lake Ladoga. But the waterway is not eternal, Führer, and as soon as winter arrives... We? Experience? What do you think? Do you intend to wait until winter? Just a villain, a traitor; only a traitor may think I'm waiting with my eastern campaign until winter. My Führer, now when some forces have redeployed to Moscow, so I don't know if I have the strength with which I could attack St. Petersburg. We will increase our bombing on Lake Ladoga. Nonsense! Party solutions. Look! Move your loafers here, dig you land and don’t just swallow my bread. Ide to Volkhov. Tychvin and Malaja Visera. This will be a surprise for the Russians. Carl Gustaf Emil von Mannerheim will join to the army of east of Lake Ladoga, on the river Svir. The Finns are sitting there in the woods waiting. St. Petersburg will be squeezed into a double ring! Strictly! So your main goal - to join the "Central" Army Group, which is headed for Moscow. Understandable? - I have to rethink this. - Don't delay! I've already decided that! And remember! The attack must begin on the 16th of October. The 16th! Not a day later! The headquarters are planning the operation here. Nevsky Dubrovka and to the edge of the Volkhov front. The attack was planned to start on the 20th of October. The task is to encircle and destroy the enemy groups on the Slisselburg-Sinjavino ridge. How many enemy divisions are there in the Leningrad district, Comrade Fegyyuninsky, according to the information available to us? - More than 50. - The Headquarters thinks so. Can we hope for reinforcements from Headquarters, Comrade Voronov? There will be no reinforcement, Alexei Alexandrovich. The situation in Moscow is very acute. All the reserves goes there. We will be forced to withdraw our troops on other parts of the fronts as well, to create strong defence. At Nevsky District in Dubrovka we have triple superiority over the enemy. On the left bank of the Neva, Nevsky Dubrovka, there was a small bridgehead that our troops had. It was occupied in September 1941. Here is were the military forces are grouped for the impending attack. Look, Commissar. Oh, well. Cheerful place. The Division Commissar called, he was interested... in whether the soldiers were well fed. I think, a bowl of hot food, serious would be provided. They say the situation is even worse in Moscow. Why did he tell you that? To raise the soldiers' fighting spirit before battle? I have to believe with the intention of upbringing, because of you. - You teach others. - Like others, so do you. You are the Commander! If we, with great efforts, can engage the Germans here, it reduce pressure in Moscow. War logic. It is very important that... everyone understands this. - Report readiness! - First century ready! Second finished! Third is ready! Forward! - What a silence. - Don't complain. What do you think, Comrade Major, when we first break through to ours, will the blockade be lifted? I don't know. We have to break through. Here they are. Help! Help! - Is Major Zvjagincev here? - Here, here. Corvette Captain Sukhorev. - Is it a big loss? - I don't know, I didn't count. No problem, then count later. - Continue to care for the wounded! - Mine? Yours will follow. Those in greater danger are those who have been here since yesterday. The enemy is waiting for you. This is the prospect here. That's it, Major. - What job did you get? - I need to contact you at Arbuzovo with the 54th. Familiar task. Yesterday morning, Arbuzovo was ours. By the afternoon, it belonged to the Germans again. Commissar! Squadron Commanders to me! - Where can I place the battalion? - You can place it here, right on the beach. We have no other choice. Look... your eyes are so sad. You should be angry! Angry! It's like shaking his fist. I will take this piece of coal and... No, no! Understand, no. What can't be understood here? Not just the hand of a hungry man, his legs also stop moving. Give me one of your pictures here, I'll bring you bread for it. Varvara Semyonovna, thank you. I'll be myself somehow. - It's kind of awkward to bother you. - Give it, give it! You don't have to do anything. Just work. DEATH TO CHILD KILLERS! For the city of Lenin, hooray! Ah, you bastard! Where are you going? 5! 5! Shoot it already that machine gun in the bunker! 100 metres, to the left of the burning house. How come you don't have a projectile? To hell with it! After me, comrades! Forward! Forward! Forward! We're going to the Baltic plant, to shipbuilders, we want to produce carts to transport tanks through the Neva. What's new at the bridgehead, Comrade Armyuninsky? In the past hours, we have managed to Tolja back the enemy half a km, in the direction of the 8th power plant and the village of Arbuzovo. Thus, we extend the starting point of our upcoming attack. Permit? - Telegram from the 54th Army order. - Reading! "On 16 October, at 4:00, the enemy's 39-year-old motor corps dealt a big blow between our 4th and 52nd Armies in the area of Chudovo to the Volkhov front. They are the main forces of the enemy starting through a designed gateway an the attack was launched in the direction of Budogosh and Tihvin. We are forced to reallocate quickly, to block the enemy's path towards our hinterland. Commander of the 54th Army." So, the Germans are in front of us. Maybe the Germans did find out of our intention? - That's why they attacked first. - I don't think so, Andrei Alexandrovich. They are heading for Moscow, this is now Hitler's main goal. Maybe the enemy engages in a diversionary operation. He wants to cut our main forces apart. Thus, the numerical chief gets to his side. Very simple strategy. And if it's all more complicated? From Tychvin to Volkhov and Svir... just an arm's length. If the Germans unite with the Finns, they also shorten the last thread, which connects Leningrad with the country. And we immediately find ourselves in a double ring. - What do you think, Comrade Voronov? - This is the worst option. But we have to consider... How many times have we burned ourselves, because we underestimated the enemy? - Tie it up. - What else is wrong? He suffered a concussion. - Did you go to Arbuzovo? - No, you can't go there without tanks. Let's raise! - Careful! - Tolja it a little. Well, doesn't it hurt much? Better that way. It just wouldn't be all that foggy. What are you smiling at? There in the woods, he remembers, when I saw him. I thought - a miracle happened. But to make the miracle to happen again, you have to be very lucky. What a luck, injured a second time. He remembers that as the evening of the first of May? Before the war? I don't want to remember anything, Aljosa. Sometimes I feel... I wish I could forget everything. There is such a disease - amnesia. When one remembers nothing. It seems to me... you are hiding something. Sister, please drink! The headquarters don't understand this hesitation on your front? Comrade Stalin instructed me to forward: "You probably don't know the extreme danger that arose Southeast of Leningrad." - Comrade General! - Wait! I was ordered to say: "If you do not immediately break through the enemy's positions, and not merged with the 54th, you will, in the end, be taken prisoner by the Germans." What's going on with you, Ivan Ivanovich? What are they waiting for? Alexander Mikhailovich, we hold the bridgehead firmly on the left bank. But we don't have the strength to expand it. We don't have enough transportation to float cannons and tanks. Our infantry is in a hopeless situation, the enemy keeps us under constant fire from the ground and the air. - We don't have enough... - You don't have to list we can't dot! I really don't understand that HQ now isn't in a position to help. neither by soldiers nor by technique. We have to evacuate our troops from Ogyessa in the south. The state of siege has been introduced in Moscow! - In Moscow? - Yes, yes, in Moscow, yesterday! We try to do our best. Not so fast, Major, I'm falling behind. - Did you give the letter to Vera? - Yes. - If I were you... - Listen, I told you once. Don't interfere in the affairs of others! DEATH TO CHILD KILLERS! Information from the local air defence order! Air Alert! Air Alert! And you, comrade soldiers, are you waiting for a special invitation? Fast, down! Fast! - Damn, that wasn't enough! - Faster! Faster! - Sit down here. - Let us stand. Leave. Sit down! Sit down! Who knows when they'll blow it off. Just sit down! What are the news from the front? - The fighting is going on. - We know that by ourselves. We read about new directions every day. They say... the government escaped from Moscow. The government with Stalin is headed by Moscow. Mama! Mama! BE ALERT AS A HERO! Back! Back! Go! Everyone to the ground! Find some angle. Here it is. - And if it doesn't survive but falls? - Shut up! - Leave the lamp here and go. - And you? I do, at least I think. Do it. I'm always lucky. But fate should not be haunted for the third time. We may not be given the big encounter, therefore, you need to know... I love you, Vera. Maybe this is the first and my last letter to you. I wish you great happiness! Alexei. All right. All right, I'll think it over. Yes, come on. Seems right to me, comrade. Hi, come on. Sit down. Now your hand? Yes... but not serious. The bone is intact. - And the other? - Oh, well... An unexploded bomb in the shelter. - This is once where you want to seduce? - You? - Probably on the front line again, if you ask? - Please. I'd like to refer you to Fegyuninsky. Here, to the staff? I'm not staying. The general is no longer here. He was appointed Commander of the 54th Army. - What, have they been replaced? - Not really. The general himself applied. He explained it to General Hozin that you have more experience in order and staff work. You also have a higher rank. But it seemed different to me. Fegyunininsky understands that Volkhov and now the fate of Leningrad may be decided. If the Germans occupy Tihvin... it will be very bad for us. In this case, a general is needed. You understand? Well, once you understand... you can go too. - Where? - The hospital next door was hit by a bomb. A fire broke out, I had to jump out the window. And the others... - Next! - Hey, you! Put that gun down! I'll put you down... I'll put you down! - Who is this? - Maybe his wife. He tore a grenade to pieces, demanded that we take him to the hospital... Katya... My Kat... And they don't want to... take you to the hospital, bastards! Operated on! And... Katya? - Where's Katya? - Calm down. I'm going to have a surgery, as he wanted. Yes, yes... Operated... How did it happen? Vera! We... we have not met since the beginning of the war. And here... they gave me three days off. I sent a message to one of my comrades, that... I'm coming today. And he... came to me. I've seen him before... As he ran towards me... Heated... And then a bomb... Right in front of my eyes! They get it right in front of my eyes... I was just standing... I was standing! Let them go. Let's all go. Vera... the pistol. What's your name, Comrade Captain? She has a husband? - No. - It's luck. Wait until the war is over. Comrades! Under severe conditions we today have to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the October Revolution. Despite temporary setbacks, our army and navy, along the entire face line heroically repels enemy attacks. The spirit of the great Lenin and the victorious flag inspires us just as much today as the Patriotic War 23 years ago. Is it possible to doubt that we can defeat but we must be defeated the German robbers of land ? The devil is not so black as he is painted. The German robbers are stretch to their last strength. A few more months, another season, possibly a short year, and Hitler's Germany has to crack under its weight of his atrocities. Take care of the victorious flag of the great Lenin! That's right, Markelics! Another year, and you're already hanging your nose. - It could be different, Maksim... - We? Things are wrong. We live on our last reserves of power. You can also organise a parade to nurture our souls. No! No, Markelics... No! They'll take care of their troubles in Moscow, you'll see. - Tolja! - Dad! - Tolja, son! - Dad! Tolja! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Sit down! Sit down, just sit down! Undress. Come on, undress! Sit by the fire! I can't even offer you... No, no, yet... I have hot water. I hope it hasn't cooled down yet. There is hot water... There are two cups. There will be plenty for the two of us. That's great! We can have a tsarist feast. Sugar? The boys shared their dose with me, when they learned I was going on vacation. Among others, Commander of our construction battalion, the chief engineer, did as well. He listened to your lectures. He signed my leave. Give him my deepest greetings. All right. - Do you need a lot of people? - I need a lot of people, Tolja... It is humiliating to realise that the work of the brain... thoughts from a slice of bread and depend on a cup of hot water. What is this? Ah... this is... soul warming. We have to prepare some monuments after the war. The names of the heroes must be engraved in granite. I wanted to imagine, to sketch, what will it look like on a pedestal the victorious soldier! Dad... you are always sober, you were a thoughtful man. But I haven't been able to understand you for a while. Why you had to join the militia when being so old? Why didn't you travel too - during the evacuation - with mum? Explain this to me. If I think about common sense... No, I don't know. What are the benefits of how did you stay here Who needs your triumphal arches? Do you have any idea about these? I think it is. - Especially when I eat. - I don't understand. When I eat my own portion, I think I take it from others. Especially from those who would need it more... Leningrad. What an impossibility! I don't have the strength to get out of here. It would seem like a betrayal to me. They can destroy this city, they can destroy our values, they can leave us here without heating and electricity, but we cannot let it be destroyed the faith, in the souls of the people! No! We will not leave! Forgive me, Dad, but these are just big words. You hate them yourself. I also see it's bad for you. We are all at the gates of death. And you, who are you wise man, whom I respect very much, you may not understand the present situation. Even if you're tired of it. I'm thinking... I'm trying to remember since when can you be like that. - We? - He's so selfish. It could have started on the day when you left... and the Germans... you left the girl... Vera. You remind me for a long time again, what this war like! - With your relentless illusions! - No, son... There are people, who are in the name of the Holy Thoughts, they go to the place of loss. Are! - Where did you come from, brother? - From Arbuzovo, where else from... From under Arbuzovo again. Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Faster! Forward! Where are you going to your mother? Forward, come on! This! After the fall of Tychvin, Volkhov is in danger. If we waited for help before, from outside the siege ring, it has now become necessary to help the Volkhov front ourselves. I ask you, comrades, the communists of the army... give an accurate and clear answer. In this situation, we can to cope with this task? With heavy artillery and tanks without maintaining supremacy we can't break their defence, Comrade Military Council. But if the ice soon is formed on the Neva, we have a plan according to which strong gateways can be designed in several places. - We could deliver on that. - We will give you all the help to produce in Leningrad. Workers in factories, they work together to the fullest. This is unacceptable, but the need breaks the law. Those who are on the "Nevsky Piggy" may be. So what do they suggest? Shall we hand over the coast to the Germans? We will fight for every piece of land. For crossing while we live. Because here... it's easiest to die. Who do we need dead? In which month we were trampled at this damn Arbuzovo, we also made huge and unreasonable losses. No. It wasn't in vain... the shed blood of the defenders of the "Nevsky Piggy". There are already three enemy divisions that broke into pieces here. There is also evidence that the enemy was forced to give up another division. Hitler could have used them on other places, either at Volkhov or Moscow. Our big losses, even if severe, we had to tolerate them. And not just at the fronts... Ask Colonel Bichevsky, why do you need as many militia as possible? In the mass graves of the Piszkarjovka cemetery those torn apart by explosives are resting. Just yesterday, hunger killed approximately 6,000 people in the city. It can be compared the losses of the battles with those that reach the population. And these women, old people and children, they didn't take part in the attacks. It's you, Verocska! We haven't waited today. Good afternoon! What about mum? How is...? She went to bed. Don't wake her up, let her sleep! Sleep! This I... That's all I managed... I would save the week. - Why - Verocska - take it away? - Thank you... - Does mum need anything? To tell you. She doesn't complain to her heart any more. But very weak. You too, Verocska, are weakened. I had a hard day today. We took care of the wounded all night. But good luck these days. Our department received tickets to the Philharmonic. We drew... and I won. That's why I came. Do you want to go to a concert? Don't you want to? - It'll be best if I go with my mum. - Go ahead, Verusa. Go, you don't have to be in the hospital all the time to sit next to the wounded. Go, you're going easier than you are with me. Go! How can they shoot the city at night? Do you want to see what happens? First, second and third cannons, prepare! Attention! Target 13, ready! - What do these numbers mean? - This is my invention, Danwitz. Each number covers one target, the location of the shot. №21 - arms factory, №9 - Hermitage, the main museum. №192 - the Pioneer Palace, №70 - the hospital, etc. Some prepared! These two are prepared! Triple prepared! In your honour, Danwitz. Fire! Now let's go to the bunker. Fast! The reply is coming soon from the artillery of their ship. One might think you want to live your life here. I love comfort. Do you have any news about the end of the war? If they weren't so unfit, our aged generals, we would have been in St. Petersburg a long time ago. No, Arnie... we didn't mean the Russians, when we started the war. They resist wildly. This hell was not included in the Führer's plan. Their resistance will decrease day by day at Moscow... And until others harvest it the fruit of victory, until then we are hiding underground here, like rats. You think Moscow is ours, they won't get stuck like we do here? Beethoven. Is this from Berlin? No, from here. Petersburg. This is crazy! Beethoven - Egmont Overture. Beethoven - Egmont Overture. Goodbye, Vera. I was with you, the neighbour said you were here. What about you? - How strange... - What? Strange, I was just thinking about you. I was just thinking of you. To what happened then... Then, with us. Kravcov... He was killed, do you know about it? Yes. That Zsogin killed him before my eyes. But let's not talk about it. Nice to meet you. It wouldn't have occurred to me, that there is music playing here in these times. How did you manage to... escape? Vera, I have a hard time talking about this. Simply, the Germans believed the tale that Kravcov invented for me. That I... I was the son of a White Guardsman, who was shot by the Bolsheviks. And I hated Soviet power... Why? Kravcov ordered me to say this. To stay alive and complete a mission. - He seems to have sensed all this in advance. - What? That you can't perform because they kill him. He trusted me very much. And I did the homework. Strange... As is all strange. Wait! I was afraid of this meeting, Vera. You would have a hard time imagining that I survived. But I can't forget what happened then. But I'm not capable of it. Wait. I'm sorry, but I have to rush to the hospital. You are too much like my dear father! You could be glad I survived. That you weren't killed during that nightmare! Yes, I survived. And no one has a right to blame me for that! The enemy clings forward, not caring about his losses. They want to break through to Moscow at all costs, with their armoured motor units. Georgiy Konstantinovich (Zhukov), do you think we can keep Moscow? I ask about this... with pain in my soul. Answer honestly as a communist. Moscow will unconditionally be kept. But no less than two armies and at least 200 tanks are needed. It isn't bad that he has such confidence. Call the staff and make sure to focus on the two reserve armies you ask for. They will be ready in a week. But tanks... we can't provide any now. They count how many mortar-launchers can they provide and how many guns as soon as possible. We currently have 200 mortar-launchers in stock and there are other weapons. Few. Forward... Today we can calculate our opportunities. Thank you for the guns. We will send the individual aircraft. With us, that's all. Send more... Please headquarters, send a plane to us loaded with complementary food. We understand that our request is a burden to you but it's very hard very for us. Zhdanov. Wait, Comrade Stalin asks to forward his deepest Thank you to the Leningradians. We fulfil your request, to facilitate the supply of the city order of Headquarters: prepare for attack for recapture of Tychvin. How are the plans going? It's hard for you to see what the options are, but try to drive. Meet Vasil Vasilovich. He has met one and a half standards since the changes. So, you are Vasily Vasilovich? I. Hi... Vasily Vasilovich. - Hey, Maksimovich! - So! - Help! - Now. - I don't have the strength. - Where would you be, aristocrat? It will not thaw in this frost. One more time. I'm just missing the patent shoes... from your feet. And you, like a scarecrow, you are always bossing over us. Got it, it worked. Good afternoon comrades. Good health! - Alexei Alexandrovich. - Good health! What did you bring? Frozen? Let's go to the stove. To warm up. Well, what's the news? With that request we turn to the workers in Kirov, to increase arms production 25-30%. We need to set it up to protect Moscow with a new army and we don’t have enough weapons. You know, people are on the brink of their strength. I haven't told you everything yet. From tomorrow, we will again reduce food ration rations... Workers receive 250 grams of bread, the dependents - 125. Death is better than that! Alexei Alexandrovich... You have to endure! You have to endure! It needs to be explained to people this is temporary. As Ladoga freezes, care will improve. People are dying. - We can't let that happen. - They're dying. Here in Kirov is the good of the working class, the backbone of the party organisation. - Listen to me, secretary. There are no meetings. You also know the Communists of Kirov, as long as their hearts beat, they work. And others help. How can you live with such doses, you say? Patients should also be considered. Young people, Komsomolists... we send instead of those who can't stand the job. For those whose condition is very severe, we organise on-call duty in hospitals. We will feed them little by little. One week, one and a half... What do you think? Action is needed. Is anyone here... Did you live? - Markovich? - Yes. Are you... Ivan Maksimovich? No, not me. In the image of the Holy Spirit. How could this happen... Markelics? As an old Peter worker... have you become unemployed? They starved me, Maksimovich. They starved? They starved. I lost my ration card. Or stolen when I was in line. - The ration card? - Yes. And you... you did not report to the plant? What about you, are you joking? Someone just... can you replace the grocery card? I had five biscuits... And a little sticky... It will be enough for four days. The plant would certainly help you somehow. The hospital was opened. You can also lie there. They also give food. I don't have the strength any more, Maksimovich. I wouldn't reach the plant either. - How does the workshops work? - How? Children. Comrade Kubarev is heaven, he stands at the gate. Waiting for admission. Are you joking? It's over for me. There's no reason to laugh, it's not funny. I came to you on the instructions of the party committee. Your party book... where is it? With me. Where else? Would you give it to me? - Why? - Because? At your place... the gate is open... You don't have one. - Maybe you'll die... - What? The living, remember, that the communist... didn't die in his bed in difficult times! I don't have the strength... Vanya. But I'm here with you... I brought you dry food. Is that what you... me? By yourself... did you visit me? I'm not a benefactor... He sent it to you by the party committee. Take it, don't be shy! Eat it! And this, I... I'm going to the... woman. To check. I want a staff member and a dependent. - Could it be a day in advance? - You can't ask, you know. A child, a worker. My bread! My bread! But why, sir! Stop! Don't run away, I'll catch you anyway! What a villain you are. Stand up! To stand up! What kind of villain are you... It's like your own you would steal your mother. I don't have a mother. - Neither do my brother - Your father? They died a long time ago. Go to the Kirov factory, to the Komsomol Committee. Look for Saveljev. Tell him Korolev sent him. - Are you going? - Counties. Wait. Eat! - Go! - Thank you. - Goodbye, Tanyecska. - Goodbye. Where are you going? To get hot water. There's hot water for everyone now, it costs three kopecks. Clever. - Are you well, is my wife home? - At home. Just... Anjuta? Anjuta! Sleep... Then, I'll let you sleep. - Why is the clock not moving? - Mum stopped it. Annuska. My dear. Why is it like... Why... Leningradians, my children! Leningradians, my prides! To break the steel door, like one who is hungry forever Fooled by the losses, like the multi-headed predator boa He grabs it and realises Without teeth and scales, The writhing snake just hisses, Ear ears sing again, Our family will be free again. Leningradians, my children! Leningradians, my prides! Jabayev Jambul's poem. This ice can't stand take yet... not even an empty lorry. It also failed. They still can't pull it out. It takes at least another week. It's bad to think about it, here are a thousand tons of food, grain, sugar, and there... It will be even worse if Volkhov falls. Here in Ladoga, the road will not help either, you will have to do it yourself destroy everything here, so that it doesn't fall into the hands of the enemy. We keep the defence with all our might, Comrade Commander. We repel the German machine gunners' sixth attack too. We persevere for the time being. The Germans are trying to encircle us. Listen, Zamirovsky! Do you know what perseverance depends on now? Volkhov is behind them! I demand! I order hold on at all costs! The fights are taking place near my battle position, Comrade Commander. Why are you telling me this? Keep fighting, Colonel! Because you failed the enemy. Keep your distance, fight at your battle position. Zamirovsky? Zamirovsky? Allow me, Comrade Commander, to move to the division and I repeat the order to them. Go! Fetch the car and go. And forward the order. Persevere to the last man! Otherwise we will lose Volkhov. And the Germans would break through to Ladoga. Go. I'm counting on you. - Where's the leader, comrades? - Where he is right now. - Where's the fight? - Who knows, everywhere. Answer normally! You'll find out, Comrade Major, You see. What happened, Molchanov? On not other front do they fight like we do, and we don't even got one tank. - And you, coward, brother? - I'm not in a hurry. It doesn't go much here with a gun. You have to go left! "Violet"! "Violet"! This is "Chamomile". "Violet"! "Violet"! Here's "Chamomile," "Chamomile." "Violet"! Sincerely, show respect! Every messenger is in the trenches, no one left, Comrade Colonel, just me. "Violet"! "Violet"! Here's "Chamomile," "Chamomile." "Violet"! "Violet"! Where's the division Commander? I'm the division Commander. And you, come on, call them, come on! Comrade Colonel, Major Zvjagincev from the army headquarters. - Did you bring soldiers? - None, just the driver. The Commander asked me to forward: "You can't retreat in any way!" Yes, I know. I have no connection with the regiment. And the message: "go and fight!" What about you, can't you see? Wherever you stand, they fight too! My whole staff is fighting. Officials, chefs, the hairdressers, are all fighting. Comrade Colonel, Chief Sergeant Holopov poses. Lieutenant General Sisov asked me to forward: "The battalion Commander was killed, the Commissar was injured." - Don't shout! Deaf? - Yes, a little... concussion. - Speak more calmly. - Which battalion? - Third, Comrade Colonel. Third. So... Comrade Colonel, let me take over order, I have experience. Do it, come on, if you're like that. - Holopov, lead the major. - Got it! Let's go, Comrade Major. - And you, go back. - I don't know, Comrade Major, that's the way it is. I have experience too. Stop! Stop! Lie! Come on, machine gunner, come here! Fast! Comrade General, the marching column is prepared to cross. As they set off, order the drivers for the doors to remain open. - And strictly adhere to the distance. - Got it! - Well, Captain, have a good trip. - Thank you. I want permission to leave, Comrade General! - Permitted. - Got it! Departure! Stop! Stop! - Are you blind? Detour! - You can't see any better either. - Do you want to get under the wheels? - Avoid it! Avoid it! Exactly one track, like the driveway in the garage. - Let's go, Comrade Captain. - Open the door! Come on, go! Where are you...? The bread... I ruined the bread. They are coming... These bastards are coming again! - "Seven"! "Seven"! Are you listening? - I'm listening. Don't rush like last time, don't waste bullets! - Let them get closer! - Aren't you running away? They do not escape. Calm down, boys. Calm. Calm down boys, let them come closer. Shoot at the green signal! Pass it on, only shoot at the green sign! Colonel, why are the Russians listening? Maybe they escaped? Primitive tactics. Go ahead, Schmidt. I'll avoid them. There's a swamp! It's frozen, Schmidt. I checked it. Kirimov! Kirimov! Look at that! Where's the major? Comrade Major, A section of a Ladoga sailor arrived under your order. The Commander of the section, Sergeant Rosly. - All right, shake your head, Rosly. - It's okay, my destiny is written. To be? Put the cannons on the edges. Holopov, Solomatin, show me the positions. Roger that! - Leave the machine gun here. - Got it! - Come on, boys, keep going, keep going! - Take position of the section! Gunners after me! Fast! - Fire! - Fire! FOR THE HOMELAND! FOR STALIN! - What do you have? - We repulsed the enemy. We kicked them back a kilometre. - Thank you for the sailors and the machine gunners. - OK, I see. If we repel the enemy by one kilometre every two hours, it will hopefully by the evening be at a distance from your position as ordered. Exactly, Comrade Commander. Wait, Major, who has arrived of those I did send there? Arrived. The major is fighting. What the hell are you wandering there for, why didn't you come back? He took order of the battalion, Comrade Commander. What? Who authorised it? I allowed it, Ivan Ivanovich. That is what the situation required. - Tell him to come back immediately. - What, I can't hear you! I don't know, Comrade Commander. He's in battle. Unplug the appliance. Let's joke a little. They were disconnected again, Comrade Commander. Can the major stay here with me? We still have to fight the Germans, I will make him a regimental Commander. Zamirovsky? Zamirovsky? Can not see. 40 kilometres and now this snowstorm... Not an easy task. I could go with my regiment, aren't we waiting for them? If a truckload of flour fails, how do you want to go with weapons? Comrade Captain, the Commander of the 54th Army is looking. - Chirokov, I'm listening. - Thank you to the sailors and naval gunners. They were a great help to us. We defended the Volkhov hydro-electric power plant adorned with the name of Lenin. . So don't be sorry, Captain. I am not sorry. Comrade Kuznetsov is also here. - Welcome him on my behalf. - Welcome. Thank you. Our losses are great. What about the youth? - The supply is on its way. - Haven't the ice road opened yet? Not yet. - Take care. - Thank you! They are coming! They are coming, they are coming! Can see their lights. It was nice! Congratulations! On the 9th of December, 1941 the Volkhov front, under the command of General K. A. Mereckovwith, liberated the city of Tihvin in a night attack and continued attacking to the west. On the 10th of December General Yunininsky 54th Army continued their attack under his leadership and drove the enemy away from Volkhov. Therefore, Hitler's generals failed to establish a second ring of blockade at Leningrad. THE END OF THE FIRST FILM OPERATION "SPARK" The Second Film The lake transport operated day and night "The Way for Life". But even when shipments arrived every day it could not even provide for 1/3 of Leningrad's daily food and ammunition needs. Driver, remember! Each of the two transports provides care for 10 thousand Leningradians. In early December 1941 Major Zvjagincev unexpectedly was called to the headquarters of the Leningrad Front. - But it's mysterious. - But why...? He got the second star and so listen. - How does he know? - A driver has good eyes. Now you may have noticed. - I just got it today. - For your correctness? - That's it. - Congratulations, Comrade Major, as they say, sincerely from the heart. Thank you. And you, what did you get? If all lorry drivers would give recognition neither silver nor gold would remain the country. Oh well. We definitely write to division headquarters... you'll get an award. I'm not doing it for the honour. I need a pendant... for "Your Courage." A war order of merit. SHELTER Comrade, you can freeze! - Look! Here's a frozen man. - They'll take you tomorrow. How-how tomorrow? What is he talking about? The car is coming on schedule to collect the dead. There is a huge hunger in the city. Leningradians die. They sacrifice their lives as heroes smashing the enemy to their last breath. Death hovered over their heads, while living in constant struggle. And the fights were never seen they continued with perseverance. That's it... boys. Take it off. The power was turned off. So, what's the matter, Markovich? Did the artist patch it? Like the trapeze, do you work? - My legs can't take it any more. - I figured this out for myself, for my job. Come on, you! Sow-inventor. Can't you handle it yourself? Did you need a reputable lathe here? Of course not, but Markelics insisted. Here is an experienced welder and immediately understood what to do. Get to know each other. The prestigious lathe, Gubarjov Vasily Markelics. He is Major Zvjagincev. He arrived to confirm the protection of the plant. Boys, come there, I need your help. Well, Markelics, are we alive? Well, after I recovered a bit in the hospital. And, Maksim, give me a food ticket for the children. Give it to them in the dining room. Now you know that they... that food must be one week in advance, after two days. Children. All right, Markelics... I'll change my mind. Ivan Maksim, I understood everything. But I was ordered to confirm plant protection from the Gulf of Finland. Yes, yes. Yes! - Ivan Maksimovich, the situation is extremely threatening. - Don't want to agitate me! We call people together and you can tell them. You can outline the situation. Nothing nothing... Last summer, the Baltic Fleet guarded the bay, but now... If the Germans drop paratroopers on the ice nothing prevents them from reaching their objectives. Required... The existing dozens of bunkers need to be re-enforced. And a hundred more men are needed for be construction. You have to dig... about three kilometres of ditches. I can't do that alone. I need people. A 150 people, but at least 100. I give the floor to the secretary of the city party committee, to Comrade Kuznetsov. Hard... It's very difficult, comrades. No electricity,... no heating, we are all hungry. It's not a military secret... that every day a lot of us die. And now this is what he just talked about, Comrade Zvjagincev. Strengthening the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Maybe a question arises by somebody that; "Isn't it all in vain"? Here is a letter that arrived in Smolny. I'm reading it now. Dear Commander, Comrade Zhdanov! I, a simple worker, I am writing to you for I have no strength to endure this suffering. We are all left to our own devices, and you know that well. Thousands of people are dying. Hunger riots will begin soon. Wait, wait, I haven't read it yet! As a committed proletarian, on behalf of ordinary people, please declare Leningrad as an open city, following the example of to civilized France. Our newspapers wrote this city is similar to Paris. So what? No one is hungry there, no one dies. And everything is as it was with their culture, they survived. We don't have a lesser culture than that of Paris. Therefore, in the name of the proletariat, please do it for the culture, and announce on the radio that by now Leningrad is an "Open city". Signature: V. V. Andrejev, a worker at the Kirov plant. Where's that rubbish? Shut up, comrades! You are interested in where this garbage is. I'll tell you. He left with impunity! - Why? - Why? Because he's such garbage we don't tolerate him at our plant... No! Usually... throughout Leningrad, no such person can be found. Turns out it's a fake. Nonsense! But someone wrote this letter. Did you have to bring it to Leningrad? You had to throw it in the mailbox! Therefore, even greater vigilance you need, comrades! Vigilance and vigilance once again! Well, what do we respond to Comrade Major? 6th of December, 1941 Quiet! our troops on the western front, were attacked by the enemy from their former combat positions around Moscow, and switched to counter-attack. A blow was measured to the flanks of the enemy! As a result of this the attack we launched divided the enemy troops, who quickly retreated, leaving behind the technique, weapons suffering great losses! Those who go to build fortifications gather in the defence Center! I demand you to stop the retirement of H. W. Guderian! Why do the Russian soldier knows how to fight to the end? You might want to say that the soldiers of great Germany less capable of heroic deeds, unlike the Russian Bolsheviks? Usually I hate the Russians, but especially the Bolsheviks, Führer. My soldiers do not spare their lives, in the case of Germany or the Führer. Yes, then why are they retiring? My order is immutable and irrevocable! The retreat is over! Now that my soldiers know that I took over the command of the troops, they won't take one step back! My Führer, your order is law! But to implement it would mean that we have to go to war in an area, which is unsuitable. There is no point in looking for new victims. I want to say that the victories were stolen from me? At first von Leeb stole it, now von Bock? Thieves! All thieves and cowards! Not only Walther von Brauchitsch is soft, your too, all of you! Sleep, Keitel! You see, my waist is generals and cowards. Why are you carrying a gun, Keitel? You should have been around a long time ago shoot him at least once. But cowardly to it! He will never shoot him! All thieves and cowards! OK! I will give you an order. You will receive it today. Aljosa! Oh, to me! Aljo... Aljosa! Did you get my letter? It's hard now, Aljosa... to think about the future. But without a future, how could it be...? - That's why... - Don't talk about it now! People suffer a lot - ours, Darya Vasilyevna, with you. Oh, the roaring sky of the night, - Most... - The earth is shaking, let’s not talk about war at all. For the poor Leningradians a slice of bread - As if it weren't. to live on in the ring of the blockade, death hears its whistle every day - we need a lot of strength, neighbour, - Sorry. how much hate and love... Vera, to the operating room! One cannot know for oneself. - Can I stand it? Will I have patience? - That's Aljosa. - You can handle it. Patience. You will live. Darya Vasilyevna, for a while, the sun will come - over our heads Last worries fly away - This is O. F. Berggolc. I know his voice. Yes, this is Olga. And how distant, so old this war will seem to us the moment the hand pulls it up... Yes! How can I help? Don't get me wrong. I was instructed to call you on the radio for a conversation. Me? Why and what? We should talk about how you interpret war, the blockade. There beside you will be the composer Shostakovich, writers. Vishnyevsky, Tikhonov, Sayanov. Just like her, Olga Berggolc. Thank you for the honour. Then, tomorrow morning at 10 we are waiting in the radio studio. I'm sorry, but we don't have a car. But I'm ready... to come for you. Don't worry, I'll leave myself. - Goodbye. - I'd charge you. ... depressed leaving a simple appearance. Exactly the same: skinny or chubby She hurries her scarf in a rush, Just like when you reach for a grenade... Here you are! Just so you don't forget to bring with you the text of your speech. Yes, yes, of course. What happened? Is it wrong? No, no, no, no! I just slipped on the floor. Goodbye! Yes, yes... The parquet. Here, here! - Is it allowed? - Fyodor Vasilyevich, please come in. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Fyodor Vasilyevich. Thank you for coming. Did you bring the text? Yes, yes. - Thank you. - I... ... seems like the wrong time? Did the comrade have an accident? Yes... you just came back from a mission... and your father, mother, and... everyone died in your home. Attention, broadcast! When I found out that it's an honour to speak to you... ... I can talk to you... it occurred to me... Who am I to ask soldiers, workers, to listen to me. What have I been doing in my life so far? I built some public buildings, two of them have already been demolished German aeroplanes and by their artillery. I wrote a book about architecture, but that's just... a drop in the ocean. Still, I'll be proud that even after my death they will stand for a long time, these buildings for a long time. But today I am proud that I'm wearing a military winter coat that I got when I was with the militia. I just want to tell everyone, who listens to me... There is no academic winter coat today, which I would prefer to wear, like this one! It seemed that the whole world has deteriorated and is precarious. Constantly only we made it of stone. But the war forced me to understand, nothing is more valuable than man, who carries and protects his great thoughts! In the past, hunger and cold seemed to the threatening scythe, death; it makes a man adhering to life at all costs. But I was wrong! I have lived in this world for over sixty years. But I never wanted to live so much as I do now. Because I want to live... to the Victory! I want to see the victory of truth over the lie! I don't believe those, who say a lie can win even for a short time! Chase away that man, no matter how close he was to you before. If doubt is nestled into the soul of man, then that means... dead. And I don't think that with temporary victories, which the enemy can boast, can save him from a final defeat! It will even be on our street... a holiday! Fyodor Vasilyevich Valicky they heard the architect's speech. - You can't come in here, Comrade Major! - Stop! Attention, Comrade Major, you can't come in here! You are a soldier. - When did that happen? - Last night. - And the people, the people? - Which people? They saved me all night, only a few survived. "That's it, Aljosa." In April 1942 a new front Commander arrived in Leningrad, Lt. Gen. Leonid Alexandrovich Govorov. Maybe we could stop? Let's wait, Comrade Lieutenant. No. What is your impression of the city, Comrade General? Clean. I saw in photographs that Leningrad is full of snow. Clearing the snow in the city was completed a few days ago. Everyone was out on the street, those who endured strength, both old and young. A complete blockade to no one didn't cause an infectious disease. The water supply didn't work, the sewerage. You can imagine what efforts had been put in to these problems. I can imagine. However, the blockade is not over yet. Hello, Andrei Alexandrovich. Hello, Leonid Alexandrovich. I was worried something had happened on the way from the aerodrome. I asked the chief of staff to take me for a drive in the city. I haven't been to Leningrad in a long time. - Welcome! - Thank you. As we begin, Leonid Alexandrovich? First I want to know our situation, where is the enemy? I need to know exactly everything where, and what kind of equipment they have? Their identity. As well as our own defence and our communication readiness, and about positions where the enemy could break through. - Did you meet Comrade Stalin? - Naturally. The Commander-in-Chief called me, before I was appointed. The instructions are three... limited to: First. Prevent Leningrad from further destruction by the siege and the enemy's heavy artillery. Second. Let's transform the city into a completely impregnable fortress. Leningrad is also called the "Fortress City". I saw a section of defence where the Narva triumphal arch stands. There could be no resistance there in another attack. Third. Let's gather our strength for a future offensive operation. You know Leningrad is still in an extremely serious situation? Yes! I know. Are you in a hurry? - Yes, Andrei Alexandrovich. - Tired of the road, do you want to relax? No way. Of course, I didn't count the time but the staff ordered, me to report at 20:30 to the head of intelligence. And now it's 20:22. Then I won't even arrest you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Like a professor in the department. He starts the exam. Zhukov endowed him with excellent qualities. St. Petersburg can barely breathe in the grip of our blockade. No! My two armies and Luftwaffe will crush these Bolsheviks. 100,000 German soldiers have, for 11 months, not been given the opportunity to take part in military operations, which could decide the outcome of the war. He's dying, but through his throat keep yourself alive! Leningrad and Stalingrad the embodiment of Bolshevik Russia. The fate of Stalingrad, it can be said as already decided. And the German army, like a poisoned arrow, dug its body into Leningrad's body. I ask you, Manstein, could this arrow have been removed? Are you sure, Führer, the 11th Army, from south to the north grouping, doesn't slow down Stalingrad’s revenue. Nonsense. Stalingrad will be delivered to me by Paulus. But victory would not be complete if in the north, everything remains the same. Look at the map again, Manstein. Kluge's troops are actually waging a stand-off war with the enemy near Moscow. After the occupation of Stalingrad, von Bock's troops will have a long way to go through the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea and on, on. They will need support. I just miss the air fleet, which is with General Georg von Küchler. St. Petersburg must be finished, Manstein. I don't specify, how you choose and from which direction you attack this damn city for the last time. Burn it! Break their resistance with heavy cannon-fire! We don't need this city! Do this, Manstein. Germany will not forget your deed. Yes, as you order, My Führer. We have reason to believe that... the enemy is attacking the city again. With our entire force you have to face. Our homeland, our party, our conscience will not forgive, if we just idle and let go allowing the enemy take advantage of this. It should be revived as soon as possible to give Leningrad the status of "fortress-city". This already sounds familiar to the Leningradians. I mentioning it so often that they are already very familiar. It seems to me that the concept of "fortress-city" will have some saying it's only one category, which is, to say, it's purely emotional. You have to become a category - an engineer! The unbiased figures they show exactly the number of fortifications, and equipment. Nonsense! - What are chimneys? - That Kirov plant, Herr Feldsmarsall. The tanks are made there. - When do they start the shift? - They're not starting any more. By then, we have already ruined the city. What is the name of the street in front of the plant? - "Stacs" (Strike) Street. - Stacs? What it means? I don't know, Herr Feldmarsall. I think it could be a Bolshevik name. Amazing! I saw the streets of St. Petersburg, trams, people who walk as if nothing had happened while we're standing here on the outskirts of their city! We're used to that, Herr Feldsmarsall. We get them used to it. I have two weeks to break the people of St. Petersburg. Up to three. Will you allow me, Alexei Alexandrovich? Order, Leonid Alexandrovich. I saw light. It turns that I am only one who can't sleep during such late hours. More specifically... in such early hours. - Reserve a seat, please. - Thank you. What's up... Leonid Alexandrovich? The enemy attacks Stalingrad. I assume, after the fall of Sevastopol, Hitler regroups the heavy artillery and move it here, against us. Construction of new fortifications needs to be accelerated. I understand. I think our country is in a big danger reached the brink of collapse. If we lose in the south, the situation will get worse. This, with my permission... my personal request. To the General Staff of the Leningrad Front, to the primary party organisation. Please pick it up all the ranks of the All-Federal Communist (Bolshevik) Party, without which I can't imagine myself in the decisive days of the danger lurking in Hazama. Govorov. The new plan of attack to occupy Leningrad It has been given the pseudonym "Feuerzauber" by Hitler. - Magic fire - The 1st of September, 1942, was determined by Manstein as the beginning, but on the 27th of August the Soviet attack began with a "roar" of artillery fire on the Volkhov and Leningrad fronts, against German troops in the Sinjavinsk-Mga area. As a result of the complicated combat situation the German's well-designed plan collapsed occupation of Leningrad. The time has come, the blockade to prepare for its final breakthrough. The excavated ditch is visible along the coast, and there are a lot of shooting ranges on the shore at varying heights, extended for a long time. Cannons at the ruins of a hydro-electric power plant and other artillery weapons are dug in. A fortified fortress is visible half a kilometre from the coast. He adds to that a large number of bunkers in the cellar system, and some destroyed buildings in the settlements. Very mysterious? Comrade Front Commander, I ask permission to speak to the Major General! - Tell me. What happened, Lieutenant Colonel? There was a loud noise from the enemy troops at night. - Tanks? - According to the reconnaissance, they pump water from the Neva and flood the shore with it. I didn't miss anything else! Can we all tie skates now? - Have you been here a long time, Lieutenant Colonel? - Two months ago. What do you see? I think Comrade Front Commander, to unite our troops, the enemy will not leave you without a word. Order, Comrade M. P. Duhanov, to merge our forces in greater secrecy. In the trenches, it's heat only at night. Ammunition and food on the front supply to the line is only by hand. No... in the event of an attack unexpectedly touch them to teach the soldiers everything. Work out every detail. Every manoeuvrer... ... every detail! - Got it, Comrade Commander. I do not agree for why do we have to do so many stairs? They say they will be sent to Leningrad, to repair St. Isaac's Cathedral. You say to Isaac to reach the heaven? The economy of Zvjagincev Zvjagincev! - Alexei! - Ivan Maksimovich! - Good afternoon, my friend! - Hi. Oh you! How did you get here? My dear friend, I always find myself where I am needed. I work here now with the plant's repair team, and what I see here is your name between the trees. What a thing! It's good we met. Why are you doing this, you bastard, why don't you give him a life sign about yourself? - So he's alive? - He's alive. He lives! - Where is he? Where? - Somewhere in the hospital. He was on the "Velikaya Zemlya" behind us. After treatment... he was sent to the Volkhov front. They put me here. People say they plan for the war to be over. You know that too! No news came from you, I was sent out of the plant. This is a letter from him. He writes about you in it too. Read it! I already know him from the outside. I wrote to Aljosa Zvjagincev, but the letter came back with it - "Recipient unknown". I hope with all my heart that he is fine. If you meet, tell him everything. I remember and think a lot about it. Glad, comrades from Leningrad, that we are like that together again... such - for Leningrad - an extremely important moment. Comrade Stalin sent me (Vorosilov) here, on behalf of the General Staff. And the staff sent your old friend to the Volkhov front, General Zhukov. Everyone present knows that the staff approved Operation 'Spark'. I pass the word to the Commander of the Leningrad Front, Lieutenant General Govorov. Order, Leonid Alexandrovich. Comrades! The Supreme command has ordered the Leningrad and the Volkhov Front, to launch an attack and break the blockade of Leningrad. This here... the part between the 8th power plant and Slisselburg. We are also launching on an attack at the Worker's Village No. 5. as the next blow in the south, at Sinjavino, We have to meet the Volkhov Front in the area of the worker's village with soldiers of the 2nd Strike Army. We cross the Neva, we will have 2 hours 20 minutes before the artillery preparations are carried out by the two fronts, reinforced with the Baltic Fleet and the defence of the Nevsky area. Date of attack, tomorrow, 12 January, at 09:30. The attack is launched by the following divisions: Colonel V. A. Trubachov's, P. Simonjak's, Colonel N. Borschov's and General A. A. Krasnov's. Questions? I think, Comrade Marshal, everything was understood. The division Commanders have already received their specific tasks. I give the floor from Andrei Alexandrovich to Zhdanov. Comrades! I make a call to you, our Bolshevik party, on behalf of the Leningrad organisation, as communists. In every communist's life, - and here we are all communists, party members and non-party members. These are special moments when we have to control our souls, and the will powers. And now this is exactly the moment that has arrived in the lives of all of us. Breaking the blockade, is not just a military operation. No! This is our duty to Leningrad, a tribute to our great leader, whose name the city bears, in front of the whole Soviet people. Comrade General, Colonel Commander is on the line. This is Simonjak. Attack! Simonjak means: Regiments of the division that pass through the Neva and continue their attack. Let's start with relocation of the tanks and the artillery. I need permission to start it. We keep in touch via radio. Permitted. We have to try, Hertsch, to stop the attack by the Russian battalions. Here. With the attack on the Volkhov front the shore is also getting stronger. It is possible that the Russians want to narrow our room for manoeuvre. Somewhere here they unite and cut us off from Slisselburg. God forbid! - Where did they gather so much power? - Anything can happen... Our prosperity in recent times changes accordingly. Move in the entire reserve. The whole! Transfer the armoured regiment here. - Where's the Führer's arrogant favourite? - Carry out order. But it's at night, General. And according to the map, there are no roads. I f the order hasn't been fulfilled in the morning you will lose your rank of lieutenant colonel! - You didn't appoint him. - What? About this behaviour we will talk later. I think the Führer wouldn't like it either. - Heil, Hitler! - Heil, Hitler! Danwitz often remembered Hitler's words, what he had told him at the beginning of the war. "The world I am building now, it will be made up of people like you, Danwitz. Five weeks after the start, we can already celebrate victory in the east." But here he remembered also the voice of the dying Captain Müller. "You've never seen how they are equated with the earth? The destruction started easily, then, everything became difficult. The complications began, it broke... We thought the Russian land was... very soft. But this only applies to the top surface... Towards the middle, it's like granite. " It is already clear and we should go another 20 km. I spit on it. Stay with Lindemann, try to crawl through your stomach. This is a Barbarian country! Even the women wear cotton pants. - Would you like some brandy? - Please. - Listen to me, Georgy Konstantinovich. - How are you, Klement Jefremovich? I returned to normal in the morning. Like you, Georgiy Konstantinovich? The attack was successful. Unfortunately, we have a hard time with the tanks, peat is everywhere. It's hard with tanks too. After a while the ice is hard to bear, we make floors. Keep in mind that Lindemann deploy your reserve wherever possible. I personally questioned the prisoners. To you, Lieutenant Colonel, immediately set up and bring two battalions to the fortified area. And a second battle line near the city. Here! The enemy is putting pressure to Borschov's division. If you manage to get to Nevahoz, our whole right wing is in danger. I do ground reconnaissance myself as I am personally responsible. - I understand, I'm responsible for it myself. - Where did the tanks come from? - According to intelligence, they shouldn't have been there. - To hell with them. - Comrade Lieutenant, "Elso" is looking for you. Comrade "Elso", the enemy is using the gap to attack... I know, just tell Borschov. Your battalion is out of position! I ordered the artillery open closing fire. Let me check the situation of Vostrisev's division in person. Instead of I am at the checkpoint, Sokolov stays here. Permitted. And remember, hold out to the end! We knocked-out several tanks, but some broke through. Shoot more accurately with the weapons! Hello, Battalion Commander? Shoot more accurately with the anti-tank cannons! Hallo! Hallo! Borschov, hey! Can you hear me? Tanks and their infantry broke through to our battle position, we need help! Urgently! They're not attacking you alone, I am also squeezed by tanks and infantry! It was beautiful, artillery! Prepare for another attack! Fire! Fire! Fire! Look at that! That's a good guy, Borschov. Still, it helps. Let's see if we stand. The tanks were hit, all injured. Please help! What happened? Why did they retreat? Here "Eagle", my four tanks are burning! I'm going to the "Kruglaja" grove. "Eagle!" "Eagle!" I order you to keep fighting! Schmidt, can you hear me? I'll keep fighting! Colonel, the general is waiting. Where is the Lieutenant Colonel? His tanks are fleeing, like rats from a sinking ship! They will not escape, General. They were shot at and burned out. You're a coward, Danwitz! It makes no sense to count successes when the Commander panics! I was never a coward, General. But you can see for yourself, the Russians surrounded us. I don't even know how to save the remains of my regiment. You don't know? I'll tell you what to do. This will be your last chance, Lieutenant Colonel! What is this? Old people and children, drive them in front of you! What are they doing, are these invertebrates worms? What are we doing, Comrade Commander? We stopped firing on the tanks, but how do we protect the people? We will protect them! Reduce your gunmen on the edges. - All right! - And you... if I raise my hand, fire! - Is it clear? - It's clear! Why, you, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, can I go? Don't shoot, let him get closer. I know the Russian wants to compromise. When I raise my hand everyone lie down! Everybody! Walter, what did the Russian say? Fire! Name, rank, position and ID number? Arnie Danwitz. Lieutenant Colonel. Commander of an armoured regiment. Have you had a regiment at Leningrad for a long time? Since September 1941. And what did you hope to achieve? We expected that the Russians wouldn't be able to endure the blockade, and surrender. If a white flag had appeared, immediately a hundred thousand Leningrad hands would have broken it. I saw different Russians. There were some... who have cooperated with us. Especially in the first months... Where are you going? Minefield! An attack is being made inside the blockade ring. Through the Neva and from Volkhov. I'm punishing you and Küchler for treason! You betrayed me, Lindemann, and my faithful soldiers, fenced under Stalingrad. United, Comrade Commander! Congratulations! That was nice, Commander! I hand over the phone to Andrei Alexandrovich. Comrade Simimanjak! Accept my appreciation. Tomorrow, the whole of Leningrad will know about your great victory. After seven days of fighting the Volkhov and Leningrad fronts military merged on the 18th of January and they broke out from the encirclement of Leningrad! Oh, my dear, far away, you hear? They broke the damn ring! You squeeze your hands, take a deep breath, with glittering tears on your face. We cry too, we cry too, mother, not ashamed of tears, warm our hearts are light and stubborn, He hasn't been crying since February last year. Let us entrust these tears peace of mind. And the enemy - melts like lead, let them fall at the moment of the fight For everything, for everyone, who perished in the blockade. Where we live - even in the beginning, long maintained by the enemy. We take revenge for everything, in beautiful silence, for everything that remained hidden on the Velikaya Zemlya! I've never wanted to live that much before, as I want it now. After the merger, the front turned south. We launch an attack at the height of Sinjavinskoye. Your battalion is on the right wing. Your objectives: They occupy the remaining parts of the fortified area and secure the area. It is possible that the Germans will try to counter-attack. - Do you understand? - I understand, Comrade Commander. In a matter of person a decision will be made later. As a result of breaking the blockade, the southern shore of Lake Ladoga was liberated in the morning of the 7th of February, 1943. Leningrad was first met at the Finnish train station by a train coming from Velikaya Zemlya. The date the blockade was broken coincided with the victory of the great Volga. The defeat of the fascists at Stalingrad confirmed Leningradians in their faith in the ultimate victory. But Leningrad was under siege for another full year. Finally, it was time for revenge on the 14th of January, 1944 with the first attack that shook the enemy troops of the 2nd Strike Army at the bridgehead of Oranienbaum. They met the 42nd Army Soldiers on the Pulkovo heights. The two forces merged on the 19th of January, and defeated the enemy troops at Peterhof and at Strelna. Then they headed further west. At the same time, the troops of the Leningrad Front continued, with the soldiers of the Volkhov Front, their attack on LUGA which resulted in 12 days of fierce fighting. The blockade of Leningrad was completely lifted. On the 27th of January, 1944 fireworks flickered in the sky above the squares and streets of the "fortress-city" in honour those who broke through the blockade of the enemy at Leningrad. It was a hard and cruel fight to the Soviet people to fight the fascism. The war killed 20 million Soviet people. Of these, approximately a million were Leningradians. They fought between the living and the dead to achieve this great and immortal victory; saving the city of Leningrad. GLORY TO VICTORIOUS HEROES AT THE LENINGRAD FRONT THE HEROES OF LENINGRAD FOUGHT 900 DAYS 900 NIGHTS THE END
