(intense music) (intense music) (radio-transmitted conversing) (indistinct conversations) - I'm Robert Kolinzki. I'm a reporter from the, uh, weekly L.A. newspaper. - Good for you. - Can we get started? - I'd like to order coffee first, if you don't mind. - Okay, sure. Uh, let me get the waitress. I saw her. Waitress. - My name is Maria, and I am your waitress today. May I help you, please? - Coffee. - [Maria] Coffee. - Straight up, black. (Mr. Karr speaking Spanish) - Yes, sir. And for you, the young one? - Uh, just a hot chocolate. No whipped cream. - No whipped cream. Okay. For the sir, black coffee, no sugar, no cream. And for the young one, hot chocolate, no whipping cream. Okay? I will come back. - I'm gonna set some ground rules here for ya, understand? - But you told me you would tell me everything you know. - And I will. But you must promise, never divulge my name. Or any description of me. No recordings, no photographs, no likenesses, no nothing. I must remain completely anonymous. Do you understand? If you want to refer to me, you can refer to me as a high-ranking government official or an inside source. - Okay, Mr. Karr. - Let me ask you something. Have you ever divulged a source? - Never. I once spent three months in jail because I wouldn't tell the judge what my source was. - I know. I checked up on you. - All right. Then you know I won't tell. - Very well. Let's begin then. First things first. I want you to picture, if you can, an indiscriminate white van traversing city streets. Nothing particularly remarkable about this van, except for the cargo which it contained. And when it reached its final destination, it delivered its cargo. And it was The Beast. - Okay. - Let me explain. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Project S74 is among our highest classified military programs. The subject underwent severest scrutinization imaginable. This program centers around an induced physical ability of every cell in the subject's body to rejuvenate itself. He is, in essence, indestructible. His primary function is to serve behind enemy lines, where he functions solely as a killing apparatus. He has the distinct advantage over the use of biological weapons in that he has the ability to distinguish between friendly forces and enemy by means of a computer chip implanted into his allies. He is programmed to kill anything which does not possess such a chip. He is not, unfortunately, programmed to stop once he starts. And he requires a full 20 seconds to rejuvenate. (jet engine whining) (ominous music) - That motherfucker killed Ramirez and Carter. There's no way this motherfucker's gettin' off this plane. - He's not gettin' off this plane alive. (suspenseful music) - You ready? - Yeah. Go. (guns firing) - Mayday! Mayday! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (jet engine whining) (horses whinnying) (cows mooing) - Come here, boy. (horse whinnying) (high-pitched engine whining) (jet engine roaring) - Get out of there, get out of there. (high-pitched engine roaring) (exploding) (horses neighing) Whoa! Did I just see what I think I saw? Or maybe it was a little bit too much of this here. I-I'm gonna call the Sheriff's office. (phone ringing) Yeah. Yeah, hey, this is Old Man Johnson out here on, uh, I'm on my ranch, and I just saw a plane go down. I mean, it crashed over there. Yeah, you bet. Yeah. Well, you,you tell Grady that there's a plane crash out here. Yeah. All right. All right. Bye now. (country western music) - [Voiceover] Sheriff. Sheriff, what's your 20? Sheriff. Sheriff, what's your 20? Sheriff Grady, do you read me? - Come on, Jenkins. This is Barett City, not L.A., I'm in my truck. I'm about a hair past Juniper Point. - [Voiceover] Copy that. Do you see anything out there close to Juniper Point? - Jenkins, all I see is the trees and the settin' sun. - [Voiceover] We got a call from Old Man Johnson about a plane crash. Do you see any smoke, anything? - Old Man Johnson, huh? Was he sober? - [Voiceover] I guess, probably not, but he sounded pretty convincing. - All right. I'll take a look. - [Voiceover] Copy that. (engine starting) (country western music) (siren blaring) (grunting) (engine shutting off) - Carl. - Grady. How ya been? - I've been good. And you? - Been awhile. - (chuckles) Yep. (grunts) Oh, yeah. - Kinda missed ya, you know what I mean? (Grady laughing) Want a sip? - Oh... (coughing) That's good stuff. - (laughing) Thank you. - Yeah. Whoa. You been hittin' that a bit much today? - Well, now, that's a fair question. I'll tell ya this... I saw what I saw. - You saw a plane go down? - Yes, sir. - You sure about that? - You've never known me to be a liar, have ya, Bill? - No, Carl, I don't know you to be a liar. So, whereabouts did you see this plane go down? - Well, it was right... right over there. About a mile and a half up, right over that ridge there. - Hm. Did ya check it out? - (laughing) Walkin' isn't one of the best things I do these days, you know what I mean? (laughing) - (chuckling) All right. I'm gonna go call the deputy. Do you mind if I take another pull off that bottle? - (laughs) Oh, sure enough. You betcha. (laughs) (moaning and coughing) Don't, don't be going anywhere with that there. - (gasping and clearing throat) Yeah, Jenkins? - [Voiceover] Go ahead, Sheriff. - I'm over here at Old Man Johnson's. Yeah. He's pretty sure he saw a plane go down. Yeah. Have you heard anything from the FAA, or the airports or anything? - [Voiceover] Negative. Nothing at all. - [Grady] Nothin'? - [Voiceover] No, sir. - [Grady] Uh. All right. - [Voiceover] Are you gonna check it out? - I'm gonna go check it out. Yeah, yeah. - [Voiceover] Copy that. - Go easy on that, big boy. I'm serious. - [Johnson] All right. Don't worry about it. I'll take it easy. Now, you all be careful out there, ya hear? (engine starting) - You be careful. I might need your help. - [Johnson] Okay. All right. Hey, be careful, ya hear? Be careful. (rock music) (indistinct conversations) - [Kirk] Hey, brother. What's up, man? - We've got a small problem. - Problem? Wh-What are you talking about, problem? You told me that your brother could handle everything. - Problem, Kirk. I don't think you pansy-asses... can handle all this glorious beer! - Oh, yeah! (shouting and laughing) - Plus. (hooting and hollering) We got a couple bottles of the hard stuff! - Dude! - Yeah! Woohoo! - Bringing the hard stuff. Good man! - Finally. Jeez. - [Mike] We are gonna get so wasted! - [Both] Yeah! - Yeah. This weekend, we are gonna redefine wasted! - Fuck, yeah, motherfuckers. (hooting and hollering) - Dude. (crunching) They have no idea. - This is gonna be the best weekend ever. - Oh, great. I'm going camping with Cheech and Chong. - You love it. - Good job, brother. I don't know why I doubted ya, man. This is, this is lookin' good. This is a nice selection. (indistinct conversation) - Um, you guys do know we're just going away for the weekend, right? (indistinct conversation and laughing) - Apparently, these kids went up into the mountain for a weekend of drinking and sex and debauchery. - Yeah, you know, uh, fun... they were gonna let off some steam. That's what kids do. - Call it whatever you like. On top of that, two curious reporters from a local newspaper, decided to stick their noses where it didn't belong. (country western music) - What are you staring at? You've been lookin' at that thing for hours. - I had the most interesting text earlier today. - What was it? - It's a video. It's this convict. He's all chained up and being transported under really heavy gunpoint. - Who's the convict? - I have no idea. But the interesting part about this? He's being transported by the military. - That's interesting. - Yeah, it is. - Well, where'd you get it? - I got it from my brother, but he got it from someone. - Well, did you ask your brother who he got it from? - Of course I did. I'm, he hasn't called me back yet. I want you to check this out. This could be something. - Is our coffee ready? - Where's that waitress? Here she comes. - This is chocolate. Be careful. It's really hot. Enjoy. Here is your black coffee. No cream, no sugar. Enjoy, sir. - Please, continue. - [Voiceover] They had managed to procure some used beer kegs from a relative or friend that worked in a liquor store. Anyway, these beer kegs contained backwash, or very limited amounts of alcohol in them. But still enough to get 'em drunk. (suspenseful music) (sighs) - Okay, babe, look. It's fine. Let's go. - Babe, we're not even done settin' up the tents yet. - Okay, there's gonna be plenty of time for pitching tents, all weekend. (chuckles) Let's just sleep here, under the stars. It'll be romantic. - Um, no. I'm gonna sleep in the tent... and you, you'll sleep wherever you pass out. And that's not gonna be on me again. - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... that was one time, okay? One time that happened. Thank you. (distinct singing) Yeah (laughing). Yes. Yeah. This is gonna be the best weekend ever! (laughing) * Don't have to be funny * 'Cause he don't care * No need for money * 'Cause there's no doubt * He'll respect you * When you put out (laughing) * My brother tells you * Maybe you should smile * And your sister says you could * Run a couple miles * But your dad shuts up * 'Cause he knows what it's about * Boys respect you * When you put out (suspenseful music) (beeping) (beeping) (suspenseful music) - Miss Martha. Um... how later are you and the Senator planning on staying tonight? I just want to make sure everything is clean for tomorrow. - We are going to leave when we're going to leave. And it's better you don't come back to this office until we're gone. Capesh? - Huh. Aren't we high and mighty today? - Today. And the next day. And the next day. And the next, darling. - Okay. I'm not gonna argue. Especially with someone who-- - Who what? What were you going to say? You're done here. You're done cleaning. Leave. Leave. - It's not worth it. It's not worth it at all. - If you continue, you'll be done, for sure. I promise you. (beeping) - Uh, Miss Martha, is there anybody waiting in the reception area? - [Voiceover] No, there isn't. - Excellent. I wanna see you at the office the lounge in five minutes. You know, our... playroom. - [Voiceover] No, I thought this would never happen. I can't wait to see you. - Okay then. - [Miss Martha] Oh! - Oh, yes. - Ride the bologna pony. (moaning) Oh, sorry! (laughing) - Don't be sorry. Oh, oh, yes. (moaning) Oh, yes. I promise I will. - Martha] The bologna pony. Oh, yes, yes. Ooh, baby, baby, baby! Yes (moaning). Come on. (moaning) (phone ringing) Don't stop, don't stop! - No, no, no, no. I gotta get this. (groaning) Hello. Senator Struggess. (breathing heavily) All right. - Well, I thought that meeting went well. What'd you think? - Yes, sir. I think he's got a good handle on our needs. Seems to be behind us all the way. But you can never tell, you know? (knocking) - General, I'm glad you're still here. Senator Struggess requests your presence at his office. It's an emergency. - Wait here. Let me see what this is all about. - Yes, sir. - (chuckles) Hi. - Um, excuse me, Senator. You have a wet spot. Stain on your pants. - Well, you know how it is. - No. Sir, I don't know how it is. - Well... Project S74 has been activated. The subject's loose, due to a plane crash. I'm giving you full responsibility, and do whatever means necessary to recover the subject. You'll have full support of this office to help you out. He was found in the woods of Colorado. A place called, uh, uh, Juniper Point. - My god. S74 is on the loose. Sir, we'll get right on it. - Thanks, General. Oh, and uh... let's not have any fuck-ups here. I need this to be cleaned up and kept under wraps. You understand. - Yes, sir. As it is. Oh, as you were. We got a serious problem. - Sir? - What I'm about to tell you is top secret. And I want your input on this. - Anything I could do to be of service, you can count on me. - Good. What I'm about to tell you, only a handful of people in the world know this. A Russian scientist defected. He was a pioneer. A leader in his, uh, in his lab. - What happened to this scientist, sir? - Well, over the past 40 years, and the advent of technology, we set him up in a state-of-the-art laboratory. We gave him all the equipment he needed. And he finally finished his masterpiece. A soldier that has total regenerative cells. The ultimate killing machine, who can infiltrate the enemy and wipe them clean. - That's incredible. - We implemented a chip that allows him to detect friendly forces and not fire on them. - Amazing. It's... it's unbelievable. - Well, he's on the loose. And our mission is to capture him, and neutralize him. - How? - We'll use a magnetic field. It will neutralize the brain and reset that chip. Then he'll be manageable. - Okay. - We've just gotta make sure that he has no contact with any civilians, like hikers, campers, and hunters. Because if he has, they're gonna be shit outta luck. - This is Karr. Who the fuck is this? Yes, General, it's a fucking secure line. What the fuck do you think I am, some kind of fucking amateur? Look, I told you what would happen if he got loose. The ball was in your court. You guys dropped it. Yes, General, I can do that. Oh, you know... since we're drinking buddies. But you fucking owe me for this. No. The only way any word will ever get out is if I leak it myself. (intense music) (helicopter blades whirring) - Go, go, go, go, go, go! (intense music) - [Soldier] Got visual? - Negative. - You finished? How was your hot chocolate? You enjoy your coffee? - [Mr. Karr] Gracias, senora. - Gracias, senor. Thank you. Sure, my pleasure. - While I was still in my vehicle... Are you out of your fuckin' mind! How in the fuck did you let that bastard get away? Do you know how much fuckin' trouble we're gonna be in, if this gets loose? It's one of our contingency plans, General. Yes, I'm quite sure. Look. You guys fucked up, and now you want me to clean it up. But I'm gonna clean it up my way. (intense music) - Command, command. This is Cobra One. Command, over. Roger. We have reached primary objective. Stand by for a report. Out, copy. (intense music) Command, command. This is Cobra One. Stand by to copy. Roger. We have two KIA. Break. The package does not appear to be on sight. Out, copy. - Roger that. Keep me posted. And again, gentlemen. I need to stress that discreetness is the key here. - Roger. Moving out. (intense music) - Deputy. Deputy, come in. - [Voiceover] Go ahead, Sheriff. Are you gonna check it out? - Yeah, I am now. Did you get any reports back on a plane going down? - [Voiceover] No, sir. Nothing from the FAA. Nothing at all. - All right. 10-4. (sighs) (suspenseful music) I'll be damned. He was right. (approaching footsteps) Who are you guys? I'm the town sheriff. - [Soldier] Get outta here. - [Soldier Two] Leave! - [Soldier] And stop asking questions. - All right. Okay. (suspenseful music) - Well. What are you waiting for? - [Jenkins] Coffee. Black. - You got it. - Hey there, Jenkins. What's goin' on? You're in late tonight. - Hey Derrick. Sheriff's got me workin' late. - Really? Why's that? - No, I am not tellin' you nothin'. - You can tell me, Jenkins. What do you know? Come on, you can trust me. I know you know somethin'. - Promise you won't tell anyone? - Yeah, I promise. - Well... apparently, there was a plane crash. - A plane crash? - Yeah. - Where? - Just outside of old Mr. Johnson's farm. - Really? - That's the word. - Huh. There has been any word from the FAA or anything. - Yeah, I know. - [Derrick] Well, did anyone else see it? - (sighs) Just old Mr. Johnson. (clicks tongue) - (laughs) Is that so? - But Grady believes him. - Hm. What do you think? - I think it's worth taking a look. - I mean, it's not like we're doing anything anyway. - You said you wouldn't say anything. - We're not gonna say anything. We're just gonna go take a drive. Let's go. (humming and guitar strumming) (intense music) (sighs) Come on, come on, come on, answer. - Still no answer? - No. - That's so strange. Your brother always called you back. - Yeah, I know. (indistinct singing and guitar strumming) (ominous music) - You're the prettiest girl ever. You are. You're so pretty. (ominous music) (rhythmic slapping) - Zach, what the hell did you bring that thing for? - That's fuckin' awesome, man. Here. Let me see it. - Hey, hey. No. - [Kirk] Just for a sec. - Don't let him touch it, please. - It's like my guardian angel. - This is the truth. This is the truth. - You know, that might be true in your world, Zach, you clever dick-fuck, but in the rest of the world, you bring a gun around here, your chances of accidental death go up by 44%. You add alcohol to that... your chances of mortality goes up exponentially. - Hey. What if we add weed. (laughing) (ominous music) * He'll respect you * When you put out (laughing) * If you put out and have a gun * - Come on. I'm just sayin'. All right, let's shoot some shit. All right? (howling and shouting) (indistinct conversation and laughing) (ominous music) - What is that? - That's something you don't see in Bear Mountain every day. - You got that right. - [Soldier] Road's closed. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn it around. Just turn the car around. Find an alternate route. (engine starting) (dramatic music) - But... why did we have to set up our tent so far from the group? (mud splashing) Why? - (slurring) Was a good question. The answer is because I know that you like to scream. (ominous music) - Got that right. Cool. - (slurring) So, ya wanna get down and dirty? (ominous music) - Hold that thought. I have to go pee. - But why? You always gotta pee all the time. (slurring) - Don't you have pee after all the beer you've been drinkin' all night, you silly goose? (ominous music) - Yeah. No. No, I've gone like 20 times. I'm good. - I bet you have. Okay, I have to go pee. Whoa. You. You get little Kirk ready for me, 'kay? Whoa. - Hey. Hey! It's big Kirk! He's big. Big Kirk. (urinating) (ominous music) (thudding and grunting) Honey, that is hot. (gasping) - What the fuck. Ah! (slashing and thudding) (suspenseful music) - (heavy breathing) Who are those guys? (engine shutting off) - [Voiceover] Nothing from the FAA? - No. You? - [Voiceover] Nothing. - That's strange. Hey, have you heard from Grady? - [Voiceover] Nothing at all. - Try his radio again. (suspenseful music) - Katie, are you sure? - Am I sure about what? Of course, I'm sure. This story's gonna be huge. - Yeah but, I mean, have you thought about what we might find? I mean, think about it. - I want this story. Let's go. Hey, let's shoot a piece. - Here? - Yeah, here. Okay. - Ready when you are. - [Voiceover] So basically, the idea is really an exploration of the duality in human nature-- - This is Katie Donahue, reporting live, just off Highway 5. Where reports have come in that a plane has crashed, just off Juniper Peak. No other details are known at this time. But take it from this reporter, we will find out. Stay tuned. (sighs) - Deputy? Deputy, come in. (footsteps approaching) - Holy shit. What was that? - [Katie] What? What'd you see? - Something just moved behind you. - What? (heavy breathing) - [Derrick] Oh, shit. - Okay. Come on, come on. I want to see. Okay, great. - All right. [Katie] Hurry up. I want to see. Okay. Okay. Right there. What was that? - I don't know. But it's out here somewhere. Let's get outta here. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not kidding you. Th-There's something not right here. - You know what? And that's what's gonna make a great story. - This is insane. (crunching) - Come on. You've got a gun. I'll get the camera. Let's go. This way. (suspenseful music) - Man, I'm fuckin' high. - Dude, I hear you. (laughing) I could fly away right now, I'm so high. - Think you got something that can do that? - I don't think. - Hey, man. You remember that story about the killer who's out here on the loose in the woods? 'Cause I don't. (laughing) - [Zach] Don't say shit like that. - [Ashley] Yeah, seriously. (ominous music) - (laughing) What if you were like...(laughing) What if you were like, you were like swimming in the ocean, and there's a dead dog there? - [Ashley] How is that fucking funny? (laughing) - That wouldn't be cool, man. (indistinct talking) (ominous music) - What the hell, Zach! - [Zach] I forgot my gun. - (sighs) That's not the gun I want. (ominous music) (fire crackling) (approaching footsteps) - Dude, where's my gun? - Dude, I don't know. - I left it right here. - I don't see it. (ominous music) (screaming) (thudding) - (laughing) Ooh, she really wants it tonight. - [Zach] Yeah, well, it's been almost a year. - Dude, what are you waiting for? - [Zach] Good point. Hey, tell me if you see my gun. - Yeah, sure. (ominous music) (dragging) (screaming) (Mike laughing) (grunting and thudding) - Mikey. Hey, Mikey! Let me see the gun, man. Give it here! Right to me. - No! After I've seen you piss on yourself at Mr.Magniputi's math class, I ain't gonna give you the gun. It's gonna stay right here with me. - I want to shoot it though! - No, Brett, you're too high to shoot a gun. - Oh, I am not. (mumbling) - Brett, I bet you're so high, you can't even find the woods. (laughing) - Yeah, dude, you couldn't even find the woods. (laughing) - Ah, you can't! - [Mike] Let's go with this. - Go with what? - Let's have a contest between Brett and Joe. - A contest? - I bet that neither of you could find the woods. - Dude! We're in the woods. We win. - (laughs) Yeah. We're in the woods. (laughing) - Listen. I want you to get all the boys together. And I want you to get 'em up to Juniper Point, ASAP. (suspenseful music) - Let's have a race. - What kind of race? - A sleeping bag race. (laughing) - Like a, like a sack race? - (coughing) Exactly. - I'm in. - [Brett] That's gay. - No, that's fun! Do it, do it! - Yeah, dude. Do it. - Okay, I'm in. - [Mike] (laughing) Sweet. - (squeals) What the fuck! Help. - [Joe] Dammit, Brett. - (laughing) I'll go get the sleeping bags. - Honey, didn't the kids and Zach go camping up at Juniper Point? - Yeah, I think they did. - Well... I heard earlier that there was a plane crash up there. - So? Call 'em. - I did. - (laughing) Well, of course you did. And? - Well, I got nothing. I mean... it went straight to voicemail. - Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, would you answer a phone call from your mother if you were out camping with your friends? - I guess you're right. - And besides, if there was a plane crash, or something serious, I'm sure we would have heard from the kids by now. As they would have probably filmed it and put it on the internet. - That's true. - On your marks! Get set! Go! - He's like a rabbit! (laughing and indistinct talking) (laughing and indistinct shouting) - (laughing) Hey, yo! Check me out. (thudding) - Get away from me! W-Who are you! Get off me, man! Get off me, please, please! (thudding) (ominous music) - Hey. - [Mike] Hey. Run! - [Tiffany] What! (ominous music) - Come on, let's just try and relax. Enjoy the night home alone. - Okay. So, what do you have in mind? - Well. Remember the night we went camping? - (chuckles) Yeah. You were a naughty boy. - Yeah... It's been awhile. - Yeah. - In addition, we were armed with smart bullets that would render him incapacitated for a period of approximately 20 seconds. This is enough time to enable us to put our device onto his head. - Okay. I get it. Uh, this is pretty fantastic. - It's also the truth. - Please, continue. - (crying) What the hell was that, Mike? - I don't know, and I don't care. - (crying) What about our friends? - Do you want to go back to them? - Yes, Mike, you have a gun, don't you? - Do I? - Yes, don't you? We have to go back for our friends! - Do we? - Yes! They're our friends! You have a gun. No man can stop a bullet. - You're right. - Let's go! - Let's go get that piece of shit. (suspenseful music) (gun shooting, screaming and yelling) - [Soldier] Hit the ground! Now! (Tiffany screaming) Shut up! - [Tiffany] Please help us! - [Soldier] Shut up! - [Tiffany] Are friends are out there! - [Soldier] Shut up! Get a hold of yourself. - We just saw our friends get cut in half! (muffled yelling and screaming) - How many? - I don't want to die. I don't. - Goddamn. - [Tiffany] I don't want to die. I don't want to die-- - Shut up. - (heavy breathing) You're freaking me out, Tiffany. Shut the fuck up. - Get down. - Are you kidding me? I don't want to die. Please, I'm sorry if I don't know how to. I don't want to die. You're gonna compromise and shut up. - Sorry to burst your bubble, but I think he already knows. (crying) I don't want to die. - Oh my god. You gotta help us. Please! - Please. Right now. - Oh god. Don't go! - [Tiffany] Please, god. - [Voiceover] Well, folks, if you haven't heard, Juniper Point has been closed down. Uh, James, have you heard about this? (knocking) It's a military exercise. We've got a call into Sheriff Grady's office... - Hi. Hey. - Has anyone talked to the sheriff? - No. - Oh my god. I've been calling my son all night. He hasn't answered his phone. (clock ticking) - (sighs) I can't believe this is happening. (suspenseful music) (heaving breathing) (bushes rustling) (ominous music) (slicing) (heavy breathing) (ominous music) (thudding) (groaning) - Hey man, are you okay? Hey. - (gasping and panting) They're all dead! - Who? - All of 'em! - Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on, get up. (groaning) (ominous music) (moaning and crying) (suspenseful music) - [Voiceover] Sheriff, this is Deputy Dillon. Eric Taylor was just picked up on a dirt road covered with blood. - What? What he, what he say? - [Voiceover] They're all dead. All dead. Over. - What? What, who? - [Voiceover] I don't know. - Has anyone talked to the parents? - [Voiceover] I don't think so. - Well, don't you think that'd be a good idea? - [Voiceover] I'll contact Jenkins right away. - Yeah, get on it. 10-4. Seems like we got ourselves a little situation here. Ah. (groans) - Office Jenkins, what the hell is going on? - Listen, everyone. At the moment, we don't know what's going on. But we are trying to figure it out. (clock ticking) The military has the road into the campground sealed off. They aren't letting in any traffic. - W-Whoa. The military? - What? The military? (suspenseful music) - You got visual? - [Soldier] Negative. (suspenseful music) - Oh, god. Oh, no, no. (retching and vomiting) Who did this? - Katie, that video wasn't a hoax. It was real. That plane went down there. He's out here somewhere! - That must be why the government's here. Let's get some of this on camera. - [Derrick] What? - Let's get some footage. I mean, what has our government done? How could they let this happen? Why wouldn't they warn us? It just doesn't make any sense. How could they let this happen? (twig snapping) Keep it running. (approaching footsteps) Oh, Sheriff! Oh, Sheriff. Thank god it's you. - Katie, what are you doing here? - Sheriff, what's going on? - Oh my god. - Sheriff, what the hell is going on? - I don't know. You two probably know just as much as I do. - Well, we think we have an idea. - Well, why don't you enlighten me? - Well, it may sound strange. - Derrick, things are pretty strange. (indistinct panicky pleading) - [Tiffany] Oh my god, no, please, no, no. (crying) (thudding) - The hell with this! I'm going up there! - Let's go. I'm going too. (dramatic music) - Good evening, gentlemen. Nice of you to come. - We know there's a fucked-up situation. Tell us what you know. - You know that information's highly classified. - Why did you call us? - We didn't call the two of you. We called you. See, that's where you're mistaken. Who's he? - He is, shall we say... someone who needs to know. If you want approval for any situation you have, he has to listen in. Got it? - Okay. We need to clean up a little situation that has to deal with national security. Gentlemen, we're gonna blow up a mountain top in Colorado. And we need your approval. - You're gonna what? Blow up a mountain? - Exactly. It's the only way to guarantee full containment of the situation. Putting it simply, we need your approval, and we need it now. - What's your cover story going to be? - We'll tell the masses that a military jet went down carrying full ordinance. Close off all the roads and the access points to the area until we clean up. - Sounds plausible. What do you think? - I like it. Let's blow the shit out of the mountain. - There you go. - General. We're a go, sir. I will. Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Listen to me. Don't tell me how to do my fuckin' job. Do you understand? If you did yours, I wouldn't have to do mine. Now, I'm the clean-up expert, and I'm here for a reason. Now, you listen to me, General, and you fuckin' listen good, motherfucker. 'Cause you owe me. I own you. Do you understand? - You getting this? - Oh, yeah. (intense music) - Oh my god. There is a plane, Derrick. Look. A-And it's the same one from the video. I looked, it's the same tail number. Unbelievable. - What happened? - I don't know. I don't know, but let's do a report. - Ready when you are. - Hi. This is Katie Donahue, reporting live-- - Turn that camera off! - [Tiffany] Hey, what's going on? - Turn that camera off! - What is going on? We have rights. - Not anymore. - [Sheriff] Hey. Hey. Where you taking them? - [Soldier] Move! Move! - [Tiffany] What's going on? - No! Please, don't! (screaming) (thudding) (suspenseful music) - [Soldier] Is he in your sight? - 12 o'clock. 100 meters. 10 feet up in the tree. - [Soldier] We got him. - No one gets through. No one. I said no one. No parents, no cops, no sheriffs, no one. (suspenseful music) - [Soldier] Is he in your sight? - 12 o'clock. 100 meters. 10 feet up in the tree. - If you should fail, we have no other option other than to blow the top off that mountain. - We got him. - He's coming down. (suspenseful music) He's trying to set us up. Look at him. He's not hiding at all. He's not movin'. Maybe we can get him in time. (roaring) - Listen to me. You have eyeballs on him. Shoot! Don't wait. Fire at will. Yes! What are you fucking waiting for, moron? Fire! - Do you still have him in your sight? - Yes. - Why aren't you firing? - He's trying to set us up. - Take the shot. (gun firing repeatedly) - Target down. Move. - Target is down. Target is down. Move. Move. Move. 12... 11... 10... 9... 8... Move. Move. 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Cobra Three, this is Cobra One. - He's gone. - (exhales) He's recovering faster. Continue pursuit. Be advised. You have 15 seconds to collapse on target after impact. Stand by for mark. - Have your men fire at will. You have the magnetic pulse bullets, right? Well, use 'em! Take him down. - [Soldier] Execute. Execute. (shooting) Execute. (shooting) Target is down. Target is down. Move. Move. Move. 12... 11... 10... 9... 8... Move. Move. 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Cobra Three, this is Cobra One. He's recovering faster. Continue pursuit. - Yes, General. I understand that. General, I insist on extracting my troops before we blow the top off that mountain. We went in with the sole purpose of incapacitating him long enough to... we have a sophisticated magnetic resonating device that will attach to his right hemisphere. Will reset the chip in his brain. Thus rendering him more or less... controllable, for lack of a better word. - Let's move. - Good god. I'll get back with you as soon as I can, gentlemen. We have to proceed with our last option. We're going to blow the mountain top. (intense music) (indistinct radio-transmitted talking) (intense music) (indistinct radio-transmitted conversing) (intense music) (jet engine roaring) (intense music) (indistinct radio conversing) (slicing) (chopping) (beeping) - You got visual? - [Soldier] Negative. (ominous music) (jet engine roaring) (intense music) - So, now we've got a bionic psychopath on the loose, cannibalizing the good citizens of... Bumfuck. (indistinct transmitted conversation) (beeping) (helicopter blades whirring) (suspenseful music) (helicopter whirring) (jet roaring) (helicopter whirring) (jet roaring) (helicopter whirring) (jet roaring) (helicopter whirring) (helicopter whirring) (suspenseful music) (jet roaring) (beeping) (jets roaring) (blades whirring) (jet roaring) (exploding) (exploding) (exploding) (fire crackling and roaring) - Watch his head. - Be there in about five minutes. (helicopter blades whirring) (dramatic music) - Our orders were to blow the top of the mountain off. We used a sophisticated smart bomb that not only wreaked havoc and destruction, but it also emanated a magnetic pulse so intense that it was closely akin to that emanated by a nuclear explosion. We had to detonate an explosion large enough to make sure it could get The Beast. But it had to be within a restricted area so we could control it. So, we flew in a B-2 with jet fighters. Then we dropped these smart bombs. Then, we flew in helicopters and extracted our troops. I stayed on the mountain until the last man left. When I looked back, I could see the destruction that we had wrought. I feel sorry for those kids who were left on the mountain. I'm sure they had no idea what they were going to encounter. You have to understand something. The Beast is programmed for survival. If he needs protein, he'll eat whatever's available. Including human flesh. It's not so much that he's cannibalistic, it's just that he's programmed to survive. You understand? So, to sum things up. We blew the top of the mountain off. We extracted our team. And we recovered his body. The rest is classified. - What do mean classified? You told me you were gonna tell me everything. - And I have. That's all there is. - Is The Beast still alive? Is this program still going on? You know, who's gonna pay for all the lives of all these kids that are dead now? You're going around blowing up mountains, wreaking havoc, all in the name of peace. Who's gonna pay for this? - I'm afraid you are this time. Senora? The receipt, please. - Oh, thank you. So good. - There you go. I'm sure you can handle that. By the way... I couldn't help but notice you had such a wonderful family. - What... the hell are you talking about? - Well. - When did you see my family? What you know about my family? - I stopped by to see them yesterday. - What the hell is this? - Well, I stopped by to check on them. You have a lovely wife and two beautiful children. And I even managed to have a picture taken with them. - What the fuck. You motherfucker. - I told 'em I was gonna see ya. Now, Robert... you listen to me. You follow my rules, and you and your family will be okay. Got it? Do you understand? - Look, look, I'll follow your rules. Just leave my family alone. But you gotta tell me. Is he still alive? - And don't cross me. - Karr. Karr, is he alive? Dammit, Karr! Is he alive? Is he alive? (ominous music) - [Voiceover] The government agencies which protect our freedoms are faced with many harsh decisions. We make these decisions, some good, some bad, the very best we can. There are many reasons why we cannot divulge the complete truth to the public at large. Security breaches, panic, pandemonium, anarchy, to name but a few. But they all lead back to the same reason. They protect us, and our way of life. For this reason, what you see and hear, and what actually transpires, are not always the same. Peace is best obtained through superior weaponry. Be it nuclear, chemical or special ops biological. The quest for military supremacy is essential. It is not just a race, and it much more than a marathon. It is an unceasing struggle to maintain an advantage over those who would harm us, and our way of life. Second place is not an option. Sleep tight, and goodnight.
