Rockstar, astronaut. Secret agent. Sex god. That was me, wishing my life away, listening to Elvis, munching on nuts. But now I know you've got to be careful what you wish for. It might come true, because at 1:05 pm, on the 25th of February, my life changed, forever. There she was. She looked like a hair advert. She hit me like a truck, but with a bit more grace, and a lot more force. She was everything you could ever want all wrapped up in this linen dress. Size six it was. She would chew things for a long time. Women around here, they never chew, just shovel it in. Goes down their neck like a bobsleigh. She was a tourist. Definitely a tourist. You think she's out of my league? He who desires but does not act is prone to dream. He who acts but does not dream is lost. I bet she eats it. Well posh. Every day, she would sit there, gorging on uncooked flesh, like a vampire. If those lips were to talk to me, I would die a happy man. She is gonna love that desk. No, she will, really, I'm telling you. One look at that desk and she will be absolutely gagging for it. See you. Who was she? This creature, this mystery, this girl. She wore a mac, like those old detective movies where the women used to kiss and chew gum at the same time. I loved her. I didn't know anything about her, but I loved her. I'd like to see the Lecture Theater, please. Are you from New York? No. Neither am I. Can I see it now? They're knocking it down. Then I guess you'd better hurry. Yeah, yeah. The wood's imported. It's from Norway. It was actually built in... 1972 by Carter, Dixon, and Gray. That's right, yeah. You study architecture? No. Dance. Would you like to go for a drink? No, why? You know when people say they've seen miracles, amazing things like, you know, they say they've seen the face of the Virgin Mary, but, in the end, it's just a piece of coal or something? Yeah. Well, what's important is they've witnessed something of such humongously large, religious proportions that their whole life just shimmers. Yeah. That's me, that is. You are my Virgin Mary coal thing. I just want to sit beside you in a bar. Go on, then, say no, I know you're gonna say it. All right, then. One drink, no fuck. What's your name? Miranda. Miranda. Lovely research, Missy, they lapped it up. Now, with the Japanese, they have to think that they're getting a bargain, so whatever they query, just agree, and if they notice the damp, fine, it's damp. It's the fucking Titanic. Agree and drop the price five grand. Agree and drop it another five. Just do as I say, and everything will be fine.

Because I loved it more than him. I never knew my parents. She wrapped herself around me like a vine, wild as the sea, and yet so fragile. It could take your breath away. Literally. In that moment, I loved her with all of my heart. Nice carpet. It's imported. It is. You're for real, aren't you? What do you mean? This room's massive. Do you want the teaspoons? No, I've got some.

I go to the shop for two bars of chocolate, 20 cigarettes, a packet of condoms, and a pint of milk. We'd have a competition to see which we could finish first. Usually, it was the chocolate, followed by the condoms, then the cigarettes. The milk lasted longest. It was long life. I always buy stuff with preservatives in it. Makes you live longer. How long have you been dancing for? About... That's nice. Weird. But nice, like you. How long? 10 years. I don't believe you. Why not? Your skin. It's like silk. Oh. What? Let's just enjoy ourselves, okay? Don't leave me. That night, she went missing. Didn't know where. She didn't say, and I didn't ask. But wherever she went, it must've been a very sad place because when she came back, a part of her had gone, forever. Here's my secret place. I have a cottage in the country. I like it here. Then stay. You're a very beautiful man. So are you. I don't even know who you are. Yes, you do. I don't know your dog's name. I don't know what you're like. I don't know anything except I love you. Shh. Tell me something, something that you've never told anyone. Why? So I can trust you. The dog's name was Sydney. Happy? Very. I like it when you stroke my hair. I'm sorry.

Maybe she was kidnapped. Maybe she just left. Life's a bitch. I know. And life has got a lot of sisters. An army of strike-busters to step in. I'd love to have a go at shagging someone really posh.

So, tell me, what did you do? What do you mean? When you made love. Are you serious? Deadly. You did fuck her, didn't you? Yeah. What was she wearing? This. Look, I'm worried... Look, fuck! Frank. She's devoted to me, right? I have this vision, right, and what I think, happens. And this, this hospital, we're going there tomorrow, together. And this little vision here. Frank. Wow, what's going on? Voodoo. You two know each other? You sent him over, I can't believe it. Look, this isn't right, all right? That is my girlfriend. Frank. No, hang on, you, right, you, you're just some, no offense, you're just some businessman. She's not gonna go for you, is she? Who is this boy, he's sensational. I don't think I'm getting through to him here. Can you help me? Right. You are coming back, yes? Yes. Jerry, that boy, the one in the Hawaiian shirt. Look, I'm in the middle of something really important. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. Frank, I think about you all the time. Going down. And I wanted to call, but you don't have a phone. Meet me then! Trafalgar Square, four o'clock. You in a hurry? Yeah. She must be important. I said, she must be important. She is, actually.

You'll make 10 times that on this. Let me be candid here. Yes, Charles, be candid. This entire deal is bullshit. The only reason you're here is because my superior is charmed. I am not. Question. Shall we start with the big one? Why on earth would an officious, inefficient health authority want a quick sale? That's a good question. Call the health authority, ask them. I will.

Why, what did she say? She told me to fuck off. Yeah, right, you know, to me, you know, that sounds quite clear. But it wasn't her. It wasn't Miranda. He who listens... Rod, Rod, not now. Do you want me to come down? Maybe I was in love with a girl who didn't exist. It was ridiculous. All those little things that I loved about her, her hair, her eyes, her smile. None of them were real. And, yet, when she kissed you, your entire body turned inside out like a surgeon removing a glove. And I bought it. I bought it all. Don't destroy yourself. Go home.

Then we can be alone together. It's my hotel. Be there. She lied. She said she was a dancer. But she wasn't. She said she was a brunette. She wasn't. She said what you see is what you get. It wasn't. She lied. Tell me something that you've never told anyone. So what? When we were together. The dog's name was Sydney. I didn't care if I'd ever been told a truth in my life. Frank. I just wanna know who you are. I'll disappoint you. You won't. I promise. Please, tell me. When I ran away from my dad's, I lived in New Jersey, and then Christian came along, and he was kind and funny. He taught me to do these card tricks that I could do in bars, you know, to make myself some money. It was so easy. I wasn't taking people's money. They just gave it to me. It was like, for the first time, I was really good at something. And then it just grew. We sell people buildings. They don't even exist. It's like whatever we say just becomes true. If Christian told you it was sunny, you'd believe him. The rain could be coming down so hard your head's bleeding, and there you are, smiling up at the sun. It's amazing. It's a con. It's what I do. It's who I am. No, it's not. The girl with the brown eyes who lay beside me by the sea, that's the real you. You haven't understood a thing. I owe him. When our heads are close, I can hear the ocean. You're late. Out. One wrong move and I'll be right up your ass. Not on your salary. I thought we were meeting in a conference room. How old fashioned. Charles, I'm glad you could join us. He's just leaving. Stay. Yes, I think I should. Have a drink, Charles, downstairs. Relax. I just need a moment or two of privacy. It's your prerogative. It is. Free hold and utilities. All in your name. I've kept them all. You're outrageous. Let's do this. The deal. Sorry. Business before pleasure. You know what you need? What? The access code. N-7-underline-B. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Give us this day our daily code. No. Hold the four and the nine down at the same time. Do it. No more games. Let's be children. Castaways in the hotel. When our heads are close, I can hear the ocean. Wait here. Let me watch. Watch this.

And then we can go to my house, my cottage in the country, the one I was telling you about with the walled garden, you know, in the fields. Yeah, I know, what the countryside is. It'll be great. Well, once we fix it up a little. What? It's not gonna happen, is it? What do you mean? How can I believe you? Because I'm telling you. Trust me. I can't do this. Right. Okay. You know, you've got the face of a child, but your eyes are old. They're not even yours. When I see my reflection in them, that's not me. I'm happy. I smile. I come from a stupid little town where me mates live, and it's called home. I thought you were gonna save me. I'm sorry. No, Frank, I can learn, I can be anything you want me to be! Frank, please! - Congratulations. - You pig. - What? - Your fucking emails? You're such a prude. Get a move on. I'm not coming. Congratulations, darling. It looks like we pulled it off. You're all grown up. Makes me feel old. You are old. You know it's a myth, don't you? What? Love. It's just an incentive to propagate the species. No, it's not. We won. But I lost. Lost my Missy. I did love you, you know. I'm sorry. Hello? Sorry I took so long. I had to see a man about a mantra. Rod? She's a conman. And? It's bad. No, Frank, your hair is bad. She is exciting. No, no, she's beyond exciting. She's international. Get out there, conquer it. I can't. Why not? I'm a librarian. Frank, you're clinging to the past. You haven't even got one. You just stayed in. He was right. That's all I did, I stayed in, read books, until I met her. And what had I done? I panicked. I'd thrown it away. In one month with her, I'd been kidnapped, we'd nicked five million quid from a psychopath, and I was alive, electrified by raw, painful, horrible, glorious life. I was in love with two women, and that was fine because both of them were her. That's the thing, I don't just love the girl with the brown eyes who lay beside me by the sea. I love the girl with the blue eyes, as well, the one in London. What was her name? Miranda. That's the point, I love both of them. The good and the bad. And the ugly. Exactly. I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her. What are you going to say when we get there? I don't know. Can I use your phone? Hello, Miranda? Hello? The fuck? How did you find me? Your smell. I can smell you 500 miles away. Look, there's 750,000 in that case. I can get the rest. I wanna know what it feels like inside your body with all those lies. I'm a caesarian. Cut from the belly of a woman, dragged into this world with all its sharp little edges. Spent my entire life trying to buy my way back in. That's sad. You deceived me! I'm sorry. Say it like you mean it. I am sorry. You deceived me. Let's start with something, shall we? Almonds, here, you want one? Hurts. With this ring, I thee we'd, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and ill health, till death us do part. That's lovely. Put down the pickle. We come in peace. You have got to be joking. I cannot strike first, but, cross this line, I act in self-defense. Your eyes betrayed the movement. How sweet, we're all together again. We come in peace. Love is a powerful force. Romeo topped himself. So did Cleopatra. Samson pulled down an entire city to win Delilah. Love conquers everything, and, yet, there are times when even love itself is powerless. At those times, I prefer to use a breadboard. You know, I used to think you were this Virgin Mary coal thing. And then I had to find out that you were just coal. But the thing is, that's all right. That's fine. I don't know what you're talking about. It's okay. What is? Everything. Then you'll come with me? Why? Because you make me wanna run around the field. Yeah, but why? Because I need you. Yeah, but, really, why? Because I love you. Okay, I wanna know the whole story. School reports, family trees, facts, everything. I'm a size six. I have bad circulation. And I was christened Alice Elizabeth Wayne. Alice? Your name's not Miranda? I have one filling and a dead root in my back molar. I've been worshiping that name. What molar? Back one on the left. Oh yeah, it's little. Yeah, it's little. There is one more thing. It involves shagging. Sounds nice. What is it? It is shagging. And there you have it. You gotta be careful what you wish for. It might come true. What are you looking at? You fancy me or something? You're not my type. Jerry, do me a favor. You've got no soul to you, Bob. I mean, look at you. You don't emotionally engage with people. You know what I'm saying? I think it's something you need to work on. Oh, you do? I tell you what birds like nowadays. A bit of vulnerability. That's what Frank's got.
