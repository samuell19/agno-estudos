- Reine! Open up! - One twenty-eight. Mum! A new record! What are you doing? I can soon do 3 minutes. You?re not to do these experiments. First child in the Guinness Book of Records. It?s dangerous. You might drown. Promise me you won?t do this at the summer camp. You said I was to go. But you don?t want to spend the summer with Granny. Let?s call it off. Go to bed now. You must leave early in the morning. It?s Stig. I can?t help it. He?ll go soon. We?ve had our moment, you and I. I want to ask you something. - Not now, it?s late. Is there a God? Off to bed now. I?ll see you off tomorrow. You?ll be away the whole summer. - When does your train go? - 11:22 Don?t tell Stig I?m going away. Promise! Stig - what a bloody silly name! Aren?t you going to bed? You?re going to the summer camp tomorrow? Did I tell you about... our turn-out with the ambulance the other day? A pensioner blew himself up with dynamite. Straight to the mortuary. We had to scrape the walls. Mop up with a cloth. Brains on the wall with a tooth in them. We could only find one eye. So you?re not going to bed? You little sod. I?m a nasty little rat. Say it! Say it! I?m a nasty little rat. 50 kroner. Go on, say it! You?ve no one else but Mum to go to. He can?t tell me what to do. We?ll just have a little talk, then he?ll go. He?s not my dad. I?ll wake you in the morning. Off to bed now. I?ll close the door now. Who is my dad? I?ll never get a boner, and never fuck. I promise. Decision made June 14th. I won?t let myself be deported to the summer camp. I?d rather die alone here in town. Procedure one. Prevent Mum from coming with you into town. How? Let her oversleep. P.S. Angels don?t fuck. Wake up, Mum. She?ll say: What?s the time? I?ll say: Ten to seven. She?ll say: When does your train go? When does your train go? - 7:15 We?ll never make it. I haven?t packed. I?ve plenty of time. I can go alone. You can?t come with me to Uddevalla. I have a job there. You?d only be bored. How you?ve grown, Reine. I?ve time to go home and pack now. To the staff at the summer camp. This is to inform you that 11-year-old Reine Larsson has suddenly expired. He is dead and cannot come. Resepctfully, his mother, Harriet Larsson. Hi Mum. Here at the camp it?s sunny and green. We swim and play football. The food?s okay. Tonight there?s community singing. I had a good trip. I caught the bus all right. I have a room to myself. There I can do just as I like. One of the boys here is Ronnie Pettersson?s son. Love, Reine. Nothing there. Nothing there either. Good. The daily check of the position gave a favourable result. June 15th at 15:24 hours. Not a single hair visible on either scrotum or penis. Terrific. One more day to live. I am a part of the world. I?ve a right to say what I like. No one can come and contradict me. Everything?s under control. You?re in control of things when you?re alone. The daily check of the position gave a favourable result. 16 June at 09:02 hours. Not one hair on scrotum or penis. One more day to live. I?m starving. Can?t think. Food, money, job. Get a job. Helene, look! Look! Cadillac. Look, Helene! Have you bought a new car? - Cadillac ?59. What will Olga say, Hester? What a nasty smell! - You?re late. - My watch is wrong. - We start work at 8. - Sod the lot of you. I can?t breathe here. You haven?t washed the brushes properly. Why can?t they wash their own brushes? So Helene with her handicap is to wash her brush because you won?t obey the rules? Brushes are expensive, 18 kronor. Three times 18 is 54, deducted from your wages. Sod the lot of you. Everyone must be punctual. Up yours, you bitches. I?m quitting. - Get an alarm clock. - Do you know why I?m late? Because I had a fuck an hour ago. You here! What the hell? - Mum?s not here. - Open up. - Mum?s not at home. - Open the door. Shut up you bloody mongrel. Why aren?t you at the camp? It was postponed... There?s an epidemic... Diarrhea... Where?s Mum? At the hospital. That is, she... She?s on night duty. Looking after old people. God help you if you?re lying. I?ll wait here. I?ve told them here you work at a hospital. There?s a caretaker here too. He hides the keys from the children. He?s noisy and silly. And lonely. Nobody likes him. He consoles himself with beer every evening. Straight to the mortuary. A pensioner blew himself up with dynamite. Straight to the mortuary. We had to scrape the walls. - You think I?m mean, eh? - Brains on the wall, with a tooth. You think I?m mean, eh? - Damn the kid. - We could only find one eye. So you?re not going to bed. Why do you think Harriet likes me? You little sod. Why do you think I come here? Open the door! Where the hell is she? Open the door! I?m a nasty little rat. Say it! Open the door! I?m a nasty little rat. Why do you think Harriet likes me? Say it! I?m a nasty little rat. You?ve no one else but Mum to go to. I?m a nasty little rat. Say it! I?m a nasty little rat. Say it! Don?t tell Stig that... In the Congo it was no problem. Stand up! Yes, sir! Where is she? Open the door! She likes me to fuck her. That?s why I come here, see? Harriet likes me to fuck her, see? Stand up! Lie down! Stand up! Lie down! Stand up! Night. Second day of freedom. Survive. Find someone who?s sorry for you. Be quiet, good, shy and harmless. Give them the feeling of power. Must have a job, must have grub. The big questions must wait. Quick-change artist Reine Larsson shows you how to survive. Work here, well... Stand on the stool, so the girls can look at you. We haven?t had a man employed here for a long time. Well, he?s hardly a man. I?m not sexually mature. If I move up to lettering someone?s needed in shading. He can go out to the cemeteries too. Can we afford anyone else? What shall we do? Let?s ask Kristine. There?s the brush washing too. I?ve begun to get eczema. Kristine, answer! I?m allergic. It itches. It?s no good asking Kristine. What does Kristine say? How are old are you? I?m... uhm... He?s fifteen. The boy stays. When?s lunch? It?s a funny story... I?ll go. Olga?s Studio. He?s cadging money again. Olga has a son - Hester. He always comes asking for money. - He?s a real rowdy. - You know how things are. Olga drinks. Soon she?ll say she must give the cat its milk. That means she?s having her whiskey. She says her blood pressure?s too high. Was that Hester? Eat up, Reine. I?m going out for a moment. The cat must have its milk. We make mourning ribbons. To be hung on the wreaths when there?s a funeral. Mostly we write "A Last Greeting" in gold. There, isn?t that nice? The lettering must be like this... so that it?s harmonious. You dip twice. And you mustn?t be afraid or hesitate. Do you think it?s hard? Board of the Arts Council. Twenty-one letters. Hester sat on that stool when he learned lettering. He was sixteen, just like Reine. He was so sweet. And you don?t mind helping someone in a wheel-chair. Good boy. I was a ballet dancer. Do you like dancing? Let?s dance sometime. Yes, let?s. Stig, blast him! The key. He chose death before the crowds. The Master. The Greatest. We?re alike. The Master. To Ronnie from his son. Are you watching properly? - Mind you don?t fall! - Quiet! Now for the start. Are you watching? Here I am, Ronnie Pettersson?s son. I think he ought to stop. - Let him try. - It?s no fun now. Absolute greatest possible silence. Music. Little scamp, he?s pretending. Well girls, back to work. Helene has a way with little boys. You must quit as soon as possible. I like it here. I have nothing against you, but you?re being exploited here. It?s nice here. - Have you been paid? - I will be later. When business is better, eh? Reine, you?re not needed here. Another thing: Why do you think Helene rubs her arms like that when she looks at you? She?s very unhappy. Imagine wanting to be a dancer and having that handicap. Never having intimate relations. And now with you here. Helene wants to die. It?s her greatest wish. To die. But she doesn?t wish to. Such people are dangerous. Watch out for Helene! I?ve been waiting for you. Are you coming? I?ve got that feeling again. As if I could get up and walk. Reine, if... If you were grown up and I could dance... Would you like me then? Oh, another epidemic? We were sent home for Midsummer. Then Mum will be along soon, eh? She?ll be very late. Then we?ll sit and wait. We?re going to go sailing. It?s Midsummer. Mum, you and I. It?s a pal of mine and his girlfriend. A posh boat he has too. - Another vodka please. - And your son? Son, eh? What will you have, Reine? Have another Cola. We?ll go sailing. Uddevalla, did you say? That means taking the train to Gothenburg. Yes, the night train. It?ll be late. It?s Midsummer. Cheers. Cheers for your Mum. Question No. 1. Is there a God. That?s a deep one. Is there a God? Is there a God? Who is my dad? Stig isn?t my dad. Cheer up, Reine. You have no dad, eh? You should have seen my dad. Bloody hell. The beatings I got. Forget it. Tomorrow we go sailing. You and I and Mum. Tomorrow we go sailing. Can you sail? Look! Where do you think he?s going to sleep? How have you planned it, eh? Why didn?t you fix another girl when Harriet couldn?t come? Tricked. Bloody well tricked. You should have one in reserve on a night like this. I do my share for Christ?s sake. What do you do? Not a damn piss. Bring this brat along. How do you like that, eh? Midsummer and no one to fuck. That kid?s squirting ketchup on my deck. Christ. It?ll stain it! What the hell do you think you?re doing? - What are you doing? You?re crazy. - Little bastard. Take it easy, he?ll float up. He can swim. Little bastard, squirting ketchup on the deck. Where is he? Where is he? Oh God, where is he? Damn the kid. Dive, Nora. I can?t swim. Don?t stand there. Come and help. Why don?t you dive? He mustn?t die. Christ, you know I can?t swim. What a feeling. I know I?m alive. To die before the crowds, perhaps he was meant to. Robbie Pettersson, he died before the crowds. Record of three minutes. I nearly had it. An angel came and helped me. Nora. Darling. Why will you never get married? If I do it?ll be with someone who?s as pure as an angel. Almost like a doll. I work with dolls. Dummies in shop windows. The kind without any hair? - How old are you? - Eleven on 14 August. Same birthday as me. Shall we spend it together? Yes, let?s. You can come to my place. Ask for Nora. What was that? Look! Fireworks. I love fireworks. Let?s go for a trip together. I?ve met a pal who has the same birthday as me. We?re going to celebrate it with fireworks. We?re collecting empty bottles. All over. Don?t tell them that I?ve paid for them. Reine, come home with me. Everyone who sees you will say: You?re the most beautiful they?ve seen. You keep your floating walk. And every step you take is like walking on a sharp knife. If you want to suffer all this I will help you, said the little mermaid, thinking of the prince. No hair there, and none there. Good. One more day to live pure then it?s all over. Damn. My last summer as a child. I must make the most of it. Then I?ll be hooked by lust. I won?t be caught by it. Poor grown-ups. They stop thinking then. - I don?t drink like you. - The wages. What about my installments, Mum? The old car was all right. Hell, Mum, I had to move up. There are two Cadillacs in town, one?s mine. Bugger the lift. People look at me. That?s power. It?s my life, see. Bloody hell. I can?t go on. Fire one of the women, there are too many anyway. Fucking lift. Tell that kid you?ve got to take a holiday. Get rid of him somehow. Fucking rockets, I?ll take them. How the hell do you afford them? Lousy sod. The longest time a volunteer has endured complete solitude without any form of stimulus to the senses is 92 hours. World record for voluntarily staying under water is 13 minutes. Come and see the play about the Virgin Mary. Tonight we present the play about Mary. Who?d like to dance with Mary? Love?s mother. Theater is power! Who?d like to dance with the Virgin Mary? The pure Virgin. Who will be the first to dare? Who will be the first? And the angel began to preach to heaven. Dear Mum, what do you think we have our own theater here at the camp. We?re playing "Jesus Christ Superstar" I?ve been given the lead. Can he do Bjorn Borg in the next play? As a kid. Can?t you do Bjorn Borg? He?s wonderful. Reine, you have a job. The Master. Charlie Chaplin?s son plays Bjorn Borg as a kid. Straighten up. Let me see. Smile. Good. I have an idea. Stick your chin out and you?ll be more like Bjorn Borg. Stick your chin out and close your eyes. It?s something about the hair? I know what it is. It must be cut. Cut? Do you think so? Marie, see that Reine gets his hair cut. This is a political ploy, see? The sports movement as a system for elimination. As a competitive amplifier, see? It?s about practical fascism. Here we see Bjorn Borg being forced into the backhand corner. He has to let go of his two-hand grip to reach the ball. It?s a big stretch. - You?re sweet, Reine. - Yes, that?s fine. Bjorn Borg 11 years old with a hair cut. Reine, we didn?t mean to laugh. 24 July, afternoon. Man is a swine. To be in control of things is to be alone. Is there a hell? Don?t know for sure. Is there anyone else but me? We?ve a kid here who?s lost his key. - His mother?s away. - Is he doped? Well, his eyes are glazed. Over. Take him to the hospital then. Over. We?ll check an address first we got from a neighbor. He says a Stig Uttler has a key. You can go. He?ll take care of me. What is it? I want my key. - Can I have the key? - He says there?s a key here. Your key? Oh, yes... Will you take the kid home? No, we?ve got other things to do. Who is it? Mum? Man is swine. Is there a pure man? Don?t know. Do I exist? Hardly. Is it important? Don?t know. Let?s have a little talk. We?ll talk tomorrow morning. Good night. I?ll give up looking for answers. I?ll look for the questions to the answers. Death. Blow it all up. Wake me in the year 2000. The power and the glory. Amen. I shall be powerful. Give others the creeps. They will all do as I say. Hell... Come and help me. Come and help me, I say. Help me with my leg, I can?t move it. Where are my rockets? What bloody rockets? Come and help me with my leg. Don?t you recognize me? - I?m Reine. - Want to see something? Wooden leg, see? But I have a Cadillac. Come and put your weight on me. - Doesn?t it hurt? - No. - What about my rockets? - They?re in the trunk. - I?m going to dance. - Can you? Bet your bloody life I can. I know a bird who?s alone out there. Show her to me. Then you can ride with us. Come on, piss off. This is as far as we go. Piss off! What?s to become of me? Mum?s worried. She?ll be wondering where I am. Can?t you drive me home? Clear off! Go on! 10 August, morning. Bloody murderer. I?ll soon show you. I?m going to be powerful, hard, cold. Dangerous. What are you most afraid of? Not knowing who I am. Not existing. What now then? Good thing you let me in. Everything else is just dirt and fraud. You are pure. Only you have no intestines... I may disappoint you. I already have your present. Tomorrow?s our birthday. Tomorrow we?ll take our trip. - Give me my shoes. - No. It?s our birthday. - I can?t go barefoot. - Can?t you go out? - I may want to dance. - Let?s stay here. - Aren?t we going to eat? - I?m not hungry. 14 August, evening. We?re celebrating with a dance. What a feeling! My mate over there needs a girl. We need help. You?re a smart guy, eh? You?re one of the Death Gang. I?m here with my girl. - With your girl? - Cola, Nissa? My name?s not Nissa. Ever tasted Finnish Cola? I wasn?t half thirsty. I must go now. Have another swig. Go on. - Got a match? - Yes. Good job, Nissa. Are you going to bed? He?ll go soon. That girl of yours. Can?t you bring her here? Sure. You screw her, I bet. Every night. Tell us how you do it. How do you do it? The usual way - in and out. Randy Nissa. What?s she like? You don?t think I?ve screwed her, but I have. Little Piss-Nissa hard at it, eh? Tell me another one. You haven?t fucked her. You?re just a little shit. A little Piss-Nissa. A nobody. You?re nothing. I?ll bloody well show you. - You hold my head down. - Sure. 3 minutes. A nobody. You?re nothing. What a feeling. 3 minutes under water. First child in Guinness Book of Records. I?m alive. I?m somebody. The daily check-up has shown a negative result. One hair visible on scrotum and penis. To hell with it. One more day to live. End message. Best wishes, Reine Larsson, almost twelve.
