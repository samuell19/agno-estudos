Let's celebrate love in a manner apart And wipe out sorrow from every heart Namaaz (Islamic prayer) being heard on loud-speakers. Bharatanatyam's uniqueness lies in the beauty of its postures... See, this is called Aaramandi. When I bend my ring finger and little finger and lock them with the thumb and spread middle finger and index finger, then it becomes kartari mukh! Looks like your father's knife... Yes! When I straighten the little finger, club the middle and index fingers, - it becomes peacock. - Oh wow! Looks just like a peacock's dance! - Come! You also try. - No, I'll feel sick. Come on. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Dad! Dad!! - Sakina! Sakina!! - Get up mom! Support her from there. Call Dr. Ansari! Dad, please darn this for me. Aunt (mother's sister) called. She's reaching in 10 minutes. There's no place to even hide in our small flat. (A prayer for the dead.) I'm sick of repeating myself. But, who's listening! I pity poor Maryam. Really. As a father, he loves her, sure. But, how can one give so much freedom to a grown-up girl? - Now, what happened to you, mother? - Nothing, nothing. Your blood-pressure rises for no reason at all. I wonder what she's going to wear today. O my poor Sakina. May God grant her peace in heaven. What're you wearing this flashy cap for, Hyder? It's a post-death ceremony, for God's sake. God knows how they're going to handle it. - Salim has no idea about hospitality. - Dear Pritam Prajapati, adored by all... What're you babbling for now! Keep quiet. Quiet. Finger on lips. Your fare. No, no. Please don't be formal. Keep it! Formal, indeed. Aunt. O my child, my child, my dear... What're you going to wear? No. Wear this. C'mon, kids. There's a lot to do. We have to organize everything. C'mon! Hello! There's a smell of milk burning. Mom, the milk hasn't even come to a boil yet. The vessel will get stained, I tell you. That won't happen, Mom. Just grate the coconut. Quick. Maryam, sugar please. How can this be enough? Salim, please get 2 kgs of sugar. And, 5gm of saffron. Mom! What? Cash. Please repeat. Can't hear you. Cash! (A prayer for the dead.) O Almighty, Why did you take my Sakina! I told Salim. Hashim Seth's here. Greetings! Salim, my condolences. May God bless her. Pass me a cigarette. What're you doing, Kazim? God forbid, you'll get cancer. Shut up. Look, Hashim Seth! - What're you laughing for? - Where am I laughing? Aunt has called you. For the prayer. Come. Let's go after two minutes. I feel suffocated inside. Let it play, please. I missed Alia Bhatt's call, man. - Okay, Salim. May I? - Stay for lunch, please. I would've. But, I have a 4 PM train for Delhi. I understand. Thank you very much for coming. Not at all. And, if you need anything, do not hesitate to ask. Please don't embarrass me, Sir. You've already done so much. I haven't yet repaid you for your help during Sakina's illness. It's nothing. If we don't help the community, who will. You're all this child has. Do take care of her. Yes. Maryam, before replacing the extra vessels do wipe them thoroughly. Yes aunt. Take care, okay? Come, Imtiaz. Come on. (Classical Bharatanatyam dance music.) Have it. Child, where did that money come from? Mom used to save regularly. Look, Mom's bird. Mom's bird. Here. Dad, what's this? 'Naan' or 'roti'? It's a 'roti' that wanted to be a 'naan'. Eat now. Eat. Dad, it's time for school. Greetings! Welcome to Gullu's restaurant. Enjoy various cuisines. - Last night I had this terrific dream. - There he goes again! Listen... I saw that I am in a lonely place. There's nothing for miles. Silence all around. Then, suddenly, I see a goat standing before me.. Oh please. With it's forelegs crossed, standing on two feet, wearing spectacles, watching me. With pity in her eyes. And, then? My hands began to shake. And, then my legs. Gangnam style. And then I noticed, that the goat was smiling at me. That's when I was convinced that my luck is about to change. And, a fantastic idea struck me. Business idea! Dark glasses for animals. Now, when a madam steps out in the sun with Timmy, his eyes will be shielded from sunlight by dark glasses. The company will be called, 'Goggies for Doggies'. How is it? Glasses for dogs? He's nuts. Do you even know anything about the outside world? You won't stop dreaming, will you? Hyder, if we stop dreaming, life will lose its colour. (Classical Bharatnatyam dance music.) If you like it, why don't you learn? - What? - Dance. Dance? Bharatanatyam. Bharatanatyam? Why're you repeating everything? Yes, Bharatanatyam. Which is taught there. Nah, I was just doing it idly. Really? Okay then. I thought you wanted to. Anyway, I did go there to inquire about admissions. They gave me this. Classes are from 4-6 PM. May I learn? Why not? Won't there be a problem? What problem? You want to learn, so learn. That's it. Dad, it'll mean fees. Should, too. It's a school, after all. However, it's better that we keep this confidential. Imagine if your Aunt came to know! This is Maryam. From today, she'll learn dancing at our academy. Maryam, at the beginning and at the end of the dance, we always offer salutations. Ragini... Hands thus, in 'katakhamukha' position. Left foot, right foot... Accepting the blessings of the Goddesses of Knowledge and Wealth... in full 'mandi' position, we accept Goddess Earth's blessings. And then, up - 'Anjali' position, saluting God, teacher, and the audience. Okay? Yes. Now, you try it. Very good. Down. Well done. First time? Very good. Thank you, ma'am. Maryam! Yes, ma'am. Come here, please. Yes. Bye! Sit. Have you really never danced earlier? Oh I have! With friends, at weddings, with my mother. Is she a Bharatanatyam dancer too? My mother is no more. But, she could replicate every dance shown on TV. Really?! Maryam, you must come everyday. Okay? And, from tomorrow, bring ankle-bells. Okay? Maryam, wait. Yes, ma'am. No need for you to bring ankle-bells. I'll arrange for them. Okay, ma'am. See you tomorrow. Bye ma'am. Bye. Oh man! For God's sake! Did the machine breakdown again, Dad? It's only a machine, not a relationship. Oh Dad, what kind of a machine is this? Which keeps breaking down so often. Time's come for you to junk it. Forget the machine, what's come over you? - I'm learning in class. Shall I teach you? - Nah, not me. C'mon, c'mon, Dad.. Come dance with me. This is called 'Sundariattami'. I see. Very good. - Very good. - No, not not... You're doing great, really. Is it? - Feet too? - Yes. My sewing action is much easier. You are doing great. Very good. (Bharatnatyam mnemonic.) You don't say! But, the truth is that Muslims consider business beneath their pride. What if they accidentally earn a profit! What're you grinning for? Am referring to your father. - Aunt! - Oh my dear girl. - How have you been? - Good. Granny! - Wow, your hair has grown. - So has she! God bless you. Aunt, why didn't you come all this while? Where do I get time from looking after them? I didn't want to come at all. It becomes such a bother for you people. No no, Amma-jaan. If you didn't come, it'd be more of a bother. Is that right? More of a bother for you, is it? Nah, I was just kidding. Is that so? What're you twisting around for, Salim? No, just horsing around. Why don't you show them? Uncle, why don't you try it too? What're you upto, pal? Sit down. Maybe I should reveal to her what I feel. Go! Go in right now. And loudly declare: Down with this oppressive society, and long live your love! Not at all. Our Imtiaz prays for his departed aunt every day. You do, don't you? Yes. How? Like this. Oh my sweetheart. Salim, how's the shop doing? By God's grace, good. You stitch Ashfaque's clothes, don't you? Uncle, do you wear dark glasses while stitching them? But, I like his style. That reminds me. Imtiaz, let me show you what I've made for you. - Go, son. - Come come, child. So, Maryam. My dear Maryam. - School work going well? - Yes. Grades? Okay, Aunt. Just okay? - I get good grades. - Well done. Salim, Laadli Aunty's son is tutoring Imtiaz these days. So, please send Maryam there. She too will study with him. That'll be good, right, Maryam? Would you study together? Yes but... Don't worry about the fees. I'll take care of that. That's not the issue. What is, then? Aunt, I have dance class after school. Dance meaning? I'm learning Bharatanatyam. What?! What're you learning? My sister's corpse is still fresh, and you're sending her daughter to dance?! Do you want to make her a courtesan? Who's visiting courtesans? What're you people talking about! This is a proper school. Charges fees. Other girls learn there too. - Don't they, Maryam? - Yes. The teacher is a lady. If this goes around, it'll bring shame on our family. You will ruin this child. Salim, have you lost it? What if the community hears of this! My love, listen. From tomorrow all this dance business will stop. Understood? Immediately after school, you'll come to my stitching class. At least, that'll be of some real use. Learning dance, indeed! Uncle, where is the power? Here, straighten this. - Ragini? - Yes, ma'am. Hasn't Maryam come today? No, ma'am. She hasn't come today. Oh? Okay, continue. Maryam? Come here. Yes, Aunt. Sit next to me. Child, you're not paying attention. I'm not able to do this. What am I to do! To learn you have to concentrate. Look... I'm not your enemy. This Bharatanatyam, that you want to learn, is not of our religion. Life isn't easy, love. If you learn to stitch etc., it'll ease things a bit. Got it? Got it? Are you okay? I don't know. I know. Your heart is just not in all this. If you already know it, why're you asking? You know what your aunt is like. No one can change her mind. If mom was around, I wouldn't have to face this. Maryam Your daughter's such a magnificent dancer, Salim! She's very talented. When she dances with abandon, it feels like she's claiming her right. My Guru had a theory. Some people choose art, while some people are chosen by art! And, Maryam, has been chosen by her art. She must be given every opportunity to dance. But, how? She can't come in the evenings. There is one way, Salim. Hurry up, child. You have to be there at 6. Hurry up, child. Wait, I'll make a wrap for you. Am getting late, Dad. Bye. But, eat it on the way, child. Listen, child.. God be with you, child. - What news of Jaffar, then? - All's well. God's grace. Oh God! Greetings, Uncle. Greetings... Uncle, is my shirt... done? Yes, it is. Just wait outside, please... This'll be done by next week. Okay, greetings, then. My shirt? What if they'd seen it? - What? - Wouldn't they be shocked? Shirt! Where do you get such... fabric? Why, you want to do fashion designing, do you? God forbid. Oh Sir, believe me. Just make it once. It'll sell like hot cakes. This is what people want! Otherwise, these new readymade garments' shops will swallow your trade. They already have! That's exactly what I'm saying. Sir, I'll pay you for this in... in, a day or two. Okay, okay. Gather your savings properly, and pay me later. Okay. Uncle... Thanks for this. Be off, now. Maryam? Yes, ma'am. Child, may I ask you a question? Sure, ma'am. You don't find learning Bharatanatyam strange, do you? Strange? I mean... since you're a Muslim... and, Bharatanatyam is connected with devotion and prayer. No, ma'am. I don't feel strange, at all. Okay. Just thought I'd ask. You didn't feel bad, did you? No, ma'am. Ma'am? Yes. Talking of strange, you know my mother taught me a strange dance. Shall I show you? Show. It's called 'Killing Flies'. Killing Flies?! I've never seen anyone catch flies like this! - You also do it with me. - No no... Ma'am! Wasn't it fun? Lots. Killing flies! We have to do it. So, tell me what happened? Dancer, dancer! Go away! Rhino! Rhino, Rhino! Shut up! Or else I'll punch you guys on the face. What happened? Why're you sulking? I'll never speak with Rohan again. Who Rohan? My classmate, Dad. Oh yes. Rohan. Why? Ever since he heard that I learn dancing, he teases me all the time. Such a small thing? How's it a small thing? He never loses a chance to tease me. And, now more so. I can't figure what's bothering him. I feel that Rohan likes my daughter. Dad! After all, my daughter is so likeable. Okay, tell me, do other boys also tease you or only Rohan? Stop it, Dad! I won't speak to you. Sorry. Now, go wash up, and eat. If Rohan comes to know that you don't wash, he'll tease you more. Dad! I'm going. Salim's daughter. Maryam! Greetings, Salim. Greetings, Priest. Please come. Everything okay? Yes. Actually, there's talk in the neighbourhood that your daughter is learning dancing. At the school on the other side. When Hashim Seth heard, he was sure it was not true. Because Salim is not that kind of a person. No. There's no misunderstanding. Hashim Seth heard correctly. My daughter is learning Bharatanatyam. At the school on the other side. Now, if you'll please excuse me, I have work to do. Maryam? Yes. On the day after tomorrow, we've organized a small prayer programme at home. I want you too to attend. Yes, ma'am. Sure. And, after the prayer, Ragini and you will give a small performance. Performance? Why, is there a problem? No, ma'am. Actually, some people known to me support the talented children of our Academy to learn further. I want them to see the two of you perform. Okay? Dad, I'm scared. As you should be. This is the first time you're performing before so many people. When your grandfather had asked me to stitch a sherwani for the first time, I too was scared like this. Really? Then? My father realized my fear. Asked me to start from the first stitch. And, then, your talent will automatically rise to the surface. Then? With the name of Allah, I began. Slowly my feet began to move, the clothes began to get stitched, and suddenly, God knows how, the machine picked up speed. Then, lo and behold - the sherwani was ready! See, child, I don't know about dance, but the thing is, start with the first step. After that, your hard work and your talent, will begin working automatically. Okay? - Go, doll, go! - Dad, I'm not scared now. First step, okay? Just focus on that first step. (Bharatanatyam mnemonic) - 'Namaste'. You performed very well. - Thank you. - Well done. - Thank you. Both of you were wonderful. - What's your name? - Ragini. And, yours, child? - Maryam. - Maryam? So, you're a Muslim! A Muslim girl, and Bharatanatyam! And, so wonderfully performed! Wow! Your parents must surely be educated people. What does your father do? Come, let me introduce you to the other guests. Okay, 'Namaste'. Come. He's a tailor. My father is a tailor. Pleasure to meet you. Thank you, Mr Jai Prakash. Thanks truly for coming here today. My pleasure, Uma. Your students danced very well. Congratulations. Thank you, Sir. Your help is very important for us. That's okay, Uma. By the way, since when has this Muslim girl been dancing here? Maryam? For a few months now. She's a very talented girl. Wonderful performance! I see. A Muslim girl... Bharatanatyam... Interesting, huh? Wait, let me introduce her to you. - Yes. - Maryam? Come here, please. This is Mr Jai Prakash, our dance academy's patron. He is the one who sponsored your anklets. - Thank you, Sir. - Welcome, welcome. You danced very well. Excellent. Thank you. Anjali, you too could come sometime to learning dancing? Yes, aunty? Her mother's spoilt her. How can she do anything else, consumed as she is by iPhone, iPad, iTunes, ithis, ithat! Come, I want to speak about something important. (Sufi song) Nice song... Isn't it awesome? Wait. See. For that... For that if we could... (Very popular sufi song plays.) Anjali! Turn off that damn thing! I like your dance by the way. Thanks. What was that move? It's called 'Katakamukha'. 'Kataka', What? Anjali! Let's go. Okay, bye. Bye. What's this sufi stuff that you keep listening to? When that Muslim girl can learn Indian dancing, why can't you? Muslim girl, Indian dance? Meaning? Isn't she an Indian? Drum some sense into her. Dad! How did it go? It was good. I knew that my little doll will shine. Was Uma madam happy? What's wrong? Nothing. Just that some people were raising odd questions. What kind of questions? Stuff like why, what, how, etc. Why, what, how meaning? Dad, let it go. But, you started this topic. And now, I'm asking you to drop it. Okay. We'll drop it. Hashim seth! - Greetings. - Greetings. Come, please come in. - Care for a cup of tea? - No, thanks. So, what can I do for you? Is your daughter not at home? She's at school, Sir. So early? - You see... - I've heard that... she goes to learn dancing. I don't want to hide anything from you. Before school, she does go with some girls to a dance class. It's her hobby. Hobby! Salim, kids don't have a sense of what's good for them and what's not. But, you're not a kid. Surely, you should know what's right and what's wrong. I understand what you're saying. But, where's the question here of right and wrong? After her mother's death, the child was very depressed. But, ever since the dance classes began, she's begun to smile again. What could possibly be objectionable about this? Yes. A mother's death can be an awful blow for children. Look, Salim. We do not object to dancing at weddings, at home rituals. But, what this girl is doing, is not right. Our people are very upset about this. With Bharatanatyam? Why? What's so bad about it? This dance involves idol worship. And, historically, it was the dance of temple prostitutes. You know who they are? Sir, I only know that Bharatanatyam is a part of our country's culture. And, even if it were as you say, why should we be bothered about the past? - I'm more worried about the present and... - Okay, let's speak about the present, then. You think that these people are pampering your child, because they want communal solidarity? Or because they seek friendship with a poor tailor? Don't be naïve. These people will make a spectacle of your daughter in public, - humiliate her and... - Thank you for coming to my humble home. Am much obliged. It's only when drops join together that an ocean is formed. A lone drop cannot withstand the sun. It turns into steam and disappears. Your livelihood depends on the community, Salim. Insult it, and you will never be forgiven. 'Fee Amanillah' Yeah Nehra. Howzzat? Hey, that's a no-ball. - How's it a no-ball? - He chucked. - I didn't chuck. - You chucked. You're cheating, Ashfaque. All of Mijwan swears by my honesty! And, here... I haven't heard anyone swear by your honesty. - That's because you're deaf. - Even I haven't heard. - Because you're blind. - I'm not deaf.. Give me the ball.. You're cheating.. Very cunning. - Sister? - Yes. What do you think of Ashfaque? Why? You do know that he likes you, don't you? Yes. And, you? Why not? Because he drives a rickshaw? Perhaps. You think my parents will agree? No chance? No chance. Greetings. Salim, what brings you here? I've come to fetch Maryam. I see. They seem have become quite friendly. They're kids. But, you should know better, Salim. Sorry? I can see what you're trying to do. But, nothing will come of it. Look, while our people will never accept you, you'll end up losing your own people. You must've heard: 'While trying to imitate a swan, the crow also lost his own identity'. Understood? These days, all I have understood, Mr Jai Prakash, is... be it Hashim Seth or you... there's no difference. You both are the same. Dad! Hello uncle. Come, child. - Bye - Bye Oh, priests? Greetings. Come, please come. We've come here to speak straight. Yes, tell me. Hashim Seth tried to explain to you, but you didn't listen. This is not an appropriate place for this. Come inside, please... we can speak at length. The time for that has passed, Salim. We've come to hear your decision. I can't do what Hashim Seth wants me to. Think about it, Salim. There's still time. - Change your decision, or else... - Or else? - Or else, what? - Maryam, go inside. - No, Dad, I won't! - Maryam! - Sir, I'm sorry about... - Enough, Salim. We've heard enough. Sorry... Why're you humiliating us? In front of everyone, we are being disgraced. You've turned us into a spectacle. Think of getting the girl married. Think of us... I've been crying hoarse that this girl's dance is going to bring disgrace to our family. But no one paid heed. God knows what our Sakina saw in this man, that she married him. Now you decide. Whether you want to dance or relation with us. To hell with all of them. If they want to ruin their lives, let them. Fine! Do what you want. Send her to the dance school. Turn her into a cheap dancer. For God's sake, Mom. Enough. As it is, they're in a difficult situation. And, we? Instead of helping out, are cursing them. And, what is your problem, anyway - with Maryam's Bharatanatyam? It's only a dance, after all. Mom, the world's changing. With it, why don't you change too? You shut up! You can't even chop potatoes properly. Trying to teach me about the world. Nothing's changed in the world. Even today, a family's honour is a woman's burden. Greetings, Salim. Greetings, Azhar. Salim, the fabric that I had sent with my son... Yes. for a trouser... I want that back. Actually, my son brought you the wrong fabric. As soon as I realized that, I came over immediately. I'll send you the right fabric later. Sure. - Thank you. - Greetings. Please come, Rahim. Greetings. What can I do for you? The thing is, Salim, I've come to take my fabric back. Actually, I wanted it for a wedding. But, that got postponed. So, there's no need. So, please return my fabric. I see. I was about to work on your fabric. But, never mind. But, doctor, you'd said that it was my turn this time? No, Salim. There's some misunderstanding somewhere. I had said that, God willing, it'll be your turn next time. On your word, I've been depositing money for two years now. And, right now, I need money desperately. Salim, in this neighbourhood, everyone needs money. When God wishes, your turn will come. Greetings. Tell me, Doctor. Loosing my turn was God's wish or Hashim Seth's? - Greetings, Uncle. - Greetings. Have some tea. To live life, I'm having to barter its very dignity. Eid is near. This year, celebrating it may not be appropriate. But, I do want a new pair of clothes for my daughter. Am doing all I can, of course... If there was an alternative, I wouldn't ask you. Are you really doing what you can? What're you gaining from all this drama? Tell me. You're no longer allowed to even socialize with our people. When people see you, they look away. Look, Salim. If you want to live in the neighbourhood, you'll have to obey the elders. Hashim Seth and Maulana Wajed are our community's leaders. It's our duty to respect their decisions. Understood? Here. Please convey my salutations to our mother-in-law. We must try to help Uncle. The source of this problem is that Hashim Seth. - Shall we abduct him? - Oh come'on. - I have an idea. - You and your ideas! Forget it. So, tell me. How do I look? Salim! When you make something for me, how can it not be perfect! Oh Ashfaque! Greetings, uncle. Your shirt's ready. Oh wow, uncle. Ready so soon? These days there's no dearth of time. Wow, this is great. I keep saying, you should design clothes for film stars. Because you can't pay me, you're flattering me? Oh no, uncle. I've brought the payment. Crisp notes. Here! No, let it be. Please take it, uncle. No, keep it. I'll be off, then. Ashfaque, Kulsum is looking for you. Where? Where? Let's go. There's Kulsum. Here. Have chocolates. Kulsum. You sent for me? Yes, Ashfaque. I have a job for you. - Ashfaque? - Yes. What job? The other day you said that you had an idea. Idea? Yes, which'll help Uncle. Yes. I do have an idea. What's the idea? I was thinking that we can get him to stitch designer clothes. Your drawings are so good. And, I'll get the customers. Okay. Greetings. Greetings. Allah-o-Akbar! (The call to prayer.) You better go from... It's the Friday prayer. Should be recited with the community. Worship is performed by believers. For God's sake, control yourself, Hashim seth. God's house is not meant for quarreling. You better not side with him! The worship of such people is not acceptable to God. Shall we leave that decision to God? Get him out of here! Ashfaque! This will disrespect the mosque. All this is not right. Don't worry, Doctor. They can keep me away from the mosque, not from God. This town, which is your home Where even evenings and nights, feel like scorching afternoons. This town, which is your home Where even evenings and nights, Feel like scorching afternoons. Where fireflies of dreams, do not twinkle any more. Diffused in whose air, Is some strange poison. Where everyday we die a little, I quarreled with myself yet again today. I slept even less today. I quarreled with myself yet again today. I wept a bit again today. Here everyone is angry with everyone else, Here souls seem to be missing from bodies, Here just no one cares about anyone, Here all you have are meaningless crowds, Here one can't seem to recognise anyone, Here even taking a breath makes you choke. I quarreled with myself yet again today, I slept even less today. I quarreled with myself yet again today, I wept a bit again today. Everyone's been asked to boycott Salim Khalu's shop. Boycott?! Why? Because of your dancing. My sister's corpse is still fresh, and you're sending her daughter to dance?! Do you want to make her a courtesan? Here there is no childlike comfort anywhere, here even hunger doesn't evoke any compassion, you'll die of exhaustion, your peace stolen, here truth no longer means anything, here people just don't smile anymore, here I seem to be upset with everyone, I quarreled with myself yet again today, I slept even less today. I quarreled with myself yet again today, I wept a bit again today. Dad! Dad! Dad, why are there no lights? Lights come and go, what's new about that? What's new is that only we don't have lights. There are lights in the entire village. I haven't paid the bill, so they cut the electricity off. Once I pay it, it'll be back. Go wash up. We'll eat together. I didn't know that the price of dancing is going to be so high. Really? And, what is that price? Don't worry. - But, Dad... - You like dancing, right? Debate's over. Go wash your face. I'm laying the table. I have a surprise for you. I've sent Ragini and your name for the Inter-District Bharatanatyam Competition. And, if you win that, you'll receive a scholarship from Delhi's Dancing Arts Academy. Isn't it a wonderful surprise? Uma ma'am, I won't dance. Why are you scared, Maryam? Ma'am, I'm not scared. Just... like that. But, you did perform at the prayer event. And, received such praise too! So, what's happened now? And, I'll be there with you. No, ma'am. In fact, I will not dance at all now. Uma madam? Yes, Uma madam. All well? Uma madam called. Maryam? Dad, I do not want to dance. Why? Dad, I'm not so naïve. You think I can't see. Eid's upon us, but no one's asking you to stitch any clothes. And, then this machine, which breaks down repeatedly. We're facing such difficult times, but no one's helping out. And, then this Hashim Seth. Dad, let's just go with his wish. Child, it isn't about Hashim Seth's wish. It's about what's right and what's wrong. And, it isn't just about dancing. It's about living life on one's own terms. Dad, but all this is happening because of me! It isn't because of you. It's because of their petty mentality. And, shall I tell you a truth? This will happen again. And, much more so. But, we won't bend. And, we won't break. No, Dad. I've decided. But, participate in this competition, at least. No, Dad. I won't dance now. Yes? Tell me. We needed some clothes stitched. I see. Come. Right. Tell me. Ashfaque said that you also make designer shirts and trousers. Yes. So, can you make one like this? The shirt should be yellow, and this checkered fabric for cuffs and collar. For me, this is the trouser fabric. Shirt. And, for cuffs and collar. Okay, sure. - What happened, Dad? - Wait there! Let me see. Infidel. Dad, please give me your phone. Phone? - 'Maryam?' - Ma'am. - Are you okay? - Yes, ma'am, all's well. Ma'am, I wanted to ask: If it isn't too late, can I participate in the competition? 'Yes, of course you can.' Thank you, ma'am. Mom's courageous daughter! Greetings. After working against our religion, you want to come to the mosque? Against our religion?! Fulfilling one's daughter's innocent wishes is against our religion? Priest, our Islam isn't so weak that it'll be disrespected by a child's dance. Strengthen your courage, Salim. You're going to need it to answer God on the day of judgment. You're right, Hashim Seth. All of us are going to need that courage. Maryam, are you ready? Yes, almost. Ashfaque's here, child. - Here, let me apply that. - No, let it be, Dad. Would you have refused your mom? Give me. Hey, autorickshaw! Stop there. Autorickshaws are not allowed inside. - I'm just dropping them a little ahead. - No, but rickshaws are not allowed. - But... - No. Go back, c'mon. We'll get off here. Come, child. One minute! Are you with the artiste? Yes, they're my family. You go to the backstage from here. All the artistes are there. Okay, child. - 'Namastey' uncle. 'Namastey'. Maryam, you're here! Come, come, the green room's that way. Uma ma'am's waiting. Come. All the best. C'mon Maryam. We're running late. Hey. Where're you going? This entrance is for important people. You go from the back. - From the back? - Yes. Come. It was too high. So, I've tied it lower. Okay? All the best. Looking lovely. Thanks. May I ask you something? Go ahead. A Muslim girl doing Bharatanatyam.. You must've faced a lot of problems. Yes. But, more than me, Dad had to face them. I see. Didn't your morale crack? It did. I decided to give it up. But, when they threw a brick to warn us, I decided. I will definitely dance! To cock a snook at them. You're a dude, girl. I like you. (Bharatanatyam mnemonic) Maryam! I knew in my heart that you'd come. Music? Yes. You're ready, right? Your performance is about to happen. - Sultana? - Maryam. Yeah, same thing. Look, finish your dance quickly. Don't take much time. And, yes, when I introduce you, you should touch my feet. Ma'am, one request. Sure, Maryam. Please seat my father and Ashfaque in the front row. - Sure. - No. The front rows are only for very important people. Understood? Friends! Bharatanatyam. The dance of India. Of India. An invaluable legacy of our country, of our culture. You're all aware, that our tradition is so great, that even if an outsider wants to learn it, we do not refuse. And today, you'll see a unique example of this very quality. You will be astonished to know who the last dancer of this programme is? Can you guess? A Muslim girl! Oh yes! Brought up in a poor family, the daughter of a tailor. Who is from Azamgarh. Friends, what does the name Azamgarh conjure in your mind? Poverty, hooliganism, violence. Its women - illiterate, hidden behind veils, mute, imprisoned in their homes. But, I... We... pulled out a girl from there, and offered her this platform. Because we... we do not believe in discrimination. So, friends, please join me in welcoming our final contestant - Sultana! Greetings. My name is Maryam. Before starting the performance, I'd like my father and Ashfaque, who are sitting in the back row, to be brought in the front row. (Bharatanatyam mnemonic) Ali... Natraj... Let it play, pal!

And, the winner of today's contest is... The girl from Mijwan, Azamgarh - Maryam! Maryam! Congratulations. Uma ma'am! You too deserve congratulations for this success. Today, proud as I am at Maryam's victory, I'm as happy about the fact that Maryam's dance has proved that art has no boundaries, no religion. Freedom is the soul of art. Now, I request Mr Jai Prakash to come to the stage and personally hand over the trophy to Maryam. Sir! A few words for our winner, please. - Today, Sultana was... - Maryam! Maryam was... wonderful. Very good. But, tell me, Maryam. How did you manage to perform Bharatanatyam to Sufi music? My parents have taught me that our country's glory lies in the diversity of its culture. Dad, please come. We all were witness to Maryam's magnificent performance. But, we never saw the person who boosted her strength, her morale, taught her to fight people's prejudices. And, that is, Maryam's father - Salim.
