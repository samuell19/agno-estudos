Who's there? No! No! Hey. You okay? What was it this time? Hey. - Breakfast? - No, I'm good. Suit yourself. But I know a guy, fries up a mean omelet. I'm good. Tell you what? I'm going to cook up some of your favorite blueberry pancakes just to... Hmm. - What? Oh. Oh, sorry. - Yeah. No, no, no, I'll take the... yeah. - See, that's why I don't do... - I need to teach you. - laundry. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Domesticate me. Yeah. Hey, I was thinking we'd take a drive down the coast, get out of the city for a bit. What do you think? I must have missed one. Sorry. Whoa, whoa. Hey, no heavy lifting. No heavy lifting. They're just some clothes, Danny. Doctor's orders. Thank you. Marie Sullivan? - Yes? - Let's see... follow-up surgery seems to be keeping the sepsis in check. Good. Think that should be all. Uh, the pain? How much pain? It comes and goes, but when I move in a certain way, it's a six. I'll send something to the pharmacy on file. Can... Can you talk about treatment options? I know this is hard. But even IVF has no real probability of success. - Can we do something? - The damage was extensive. I'd focus on recovery and forget any... distractions. - But Doct... - Yes? Want to talk about it? Talk about what? Anything. The doctor said I should focus on getting healthy and forget about anything else. Is that so bad? So bad? You can still have kids, so I guess it's not so bad for you, is it? Who am I having kids with? Someone else. Wait. Stop. I'm sorry. Stop. I'm sorry. I j... I don't know what we're gonna do. Come here. We're going to live. Okay? Come here. Just live, okay? - You know what I was thinking? - What's up? I think that trip down the coast sounds pretty nice. - What? - Uh... nothing to worry about. Um... It's from the hospital. Twenty-six thousand dollars? They want us to keep paying them for what they did to me? Look, I'm... I'm sure we can negotiate it down, it's just... We just got to call up the lawyer and... Goddammit. Hey. I'll be right back. Okay? Just wait right here. All right. Okay, come on. - What's that? - Nothing. Are you gonna tell me what that is? So, I was doing some research online and I came across this herbal remedy. Figured we'd try the holistic approach? This is where we're at now? Three rounds of IVF, second opinions, third opinions, fourth opinions, yeah. This is where we're at. - What... - You're supposed to take it with food. I thought you said you wanted to give up. I'm in it as long as you are. Hey, are you okay? - What happened? - I ate a little bit. Did you take it with food? Drink up. Here. I am so, so sorry, that was stupid. Don't apologize. Okay? We're done with all this. Done. Just give me a minute, okay? Okay. Yeah, I'll go, um... I'll just take care of some work, then. All right. Welcome to the Lands Institute. Welcome to the Lands Institute of Reproductive Science.

Let's, um... Let's put this all behind us and move on. Sure you don't want to hear 'em out? One free vacation courtesy of Dr. Lands coming right up. The other one. Oh, come on, I thought you'd be getting a little excited by now. I don't want to get my hopes up, okay? Don't be afraid of hope. It's what keeps us. Even if it's all bullshit? Marie, you need to cut out this negativity, okay? If this has any chance of working out, we're gonna have to put every ounce of ourselves into it. You don't get it. It's all on me. The doctors, the checkups, the drugs. It's all on me. Marie, you haven't thought that this could have been really hard on me, too? Look, I wish I could tell you not to worry, I wish I could tell you everything's gonna be okay, but I can't because I don't know. All I can do is promise you aren't in this alone. Okay? - Together, right? - Right. Go ahead. I'll take your bags. Cheer up. Come on. - All right. - After you. We wanted to get out of town, right? Right. Don't worry, it'll be here when we get back. Come on. We have snacks and juices, so feel free to help yourself. Um, how long is the drive? A few hours, but we'll get there in a flash. Just sit back and relax. Want one? - One? - No. Oh, come on, try one. Come on. Try one. They're really good. Don't like it? Here, I'll eat it. Hmm. Where we goin'? We ain't in Brooklyn anymore. Yeah. It's literally in the middle of nowhere. You'd have to drive back an hour just to get to nowhere. Great, the place 5G forgot. Yeah, you'd think it'd be centrally located for all the fancy people. Well... it is the middle of nowhere. Yeah, the doc believes in the health properties of the great outdoors. Welcome to your new home. Yeah. Wow! Smell that fresh air? It's nice. - Hey, I'm rootin' for you guys. - Thank you. Hey, listen, I, uh... Um... Take care of yourself. - Welcome. - Hi. Hi. Careful, they're heavy. Okay. Right this way. All these babies, these families... they're from here? These are just the recent ones. Right this way. - For your use on campus. - Oh? We wear these, not normal clothes? The Lands Institute for Reproductive Sciences is more than just a clinic. It is a world-class research center, wildlife sanctuary and holistic retreat to nurture the body and mind. Okay, I didn't see any medical equipment. A lab is downstairs and there are additional facilities nearby. Okay. And when does treatment begin? The doctor will explain all the details himself. Okay, thank you. It's almost like a vacation, huh? Yeah, maybe for you. Did you see all those pictures? If anyone can help us, he can. - If this doesn't work... - It will... - You should find another part... - Oh, my God, stop that. And if it doesn't work, so what? We can always adopt. - You sure? - Yes, of course. Babe, there are a million beautiful babies just waiting to be taken. That didn't sound right. What I meant to say was there are so many kids out there who need a loving home. And we can give it to them. 'Kay. We're in this together, right? Now, can we please have some fun? Yes. Try this on. Fancy. Who's there? Dinner is served. Dinner is served. Can't believe we fell asleep. No... I hope the food's not too weird. Alfalfa sprouts and all that. You remember the slop those hippies fed us at that music festival? Hello, everyone. Oh, these must be the new guests. Steve Williams. And this is my wife, my life... - My paycheck. - Oh, Mel. Don't embarrass me in front of the new guests. Oh, I didn't realize you felt shame, dear. - Um, I'm Danny. - I'm Marie. - How do you do? - Pleasure. Oh, and these are... Oh, well, I suspect they might get offended if I, as a man, dare introduce them, so... Steve, don't be obnoxious. I'm Izzy. And this is Blu. Hey, guys. - Hi. - It's really great - Welcome. - to meet you guys. Mm-hmm. Good to meet you, too. Here. So... Welcome to Paradise. Paradise? Yeah. I mean, everyone's been tested for everything. There's healthy food and the freshest air in the Northeast. I mean, if this isn't heaven, I don't know what is. It's like being in rehab. You'd know about that, right, Steve? But I don't care about the appointments. We're here for results. My lovely golden toilet is far superior to the common porcelain I find here. - Ah-ha... - Ooh, well, I am famished. This is quite the, uh, interesting spread. Yeah, where... where did you get the stuff from? It's all grown on the private farm and greenhouses. I thought it looked weird, too, but... it's yummy. Try something. Okay. It's not bad. I'm game. The doctor designed the whole process to supercharge the body and shed the world's everyday toxins. The doctor? What's he like? Oh, he's wonderful. He's so caring, so brilliant. A bit of a control freak, but I suppose you must respect the intellect. He speaks five different languages, dear. - Who doesn't? - Don't worry about anything. I'm sure you'll be fine, too. She's just upset that at her advanced age, fertility is an uphill battle. I'm sure you two bitches are cozy as clams with God knows what designer sperm he's sold you. Don't be crass, dear. I'll be what I damn well please. Now go fetch me a drink. So, you're here for artificial insemination? Mm, kind of. It's... A boring medical procedure. Nothing to discuss at the dinner table. Welcome. Let go of all your fear and doubt. You're exactly where you need to be. Oh. Dr. Lands, it is an honor to, uh... to be here, thank you. Yes, thank you for accepting us. Oh, please, it's my purpose. Everyone, please welcome the new guests. - Willkommen. - Welcome, guys. It's gonna be a trip! Mm, we do so love fresh meat around here, do we not? Well, it'll be good to have some nice people around here for a change. No offense, Doc. It's amazing what you seem to do for people. Nonsense. It's what they do for me. Come, you must nourish your body if you're going to let the seed take root. - Why do we wear these tunics? - To allow for circulation. Normal clothing's just too restrictive. You must learn to rhythms of life. It begins with the primordial fluids. They're a key element of treatment here. It's a cocktail of herbs and roots, sourced everywhere from India to the Amazon. - There are drugs in this? - Not pharmaceuticals, if that's what you're asking. Many pharmas are just synthetic copies. The drug companies can't profit, so they just twist the molecules. These are pure. Oh, I'm completely healthy, thanks. This is for the therapy. Everyone is tuned. Danny, even if you are healthy, can you not exist at an optimal level? To ease Marie's burden and meet her halfway? Bottoms up. Cheers. Oh, you don't drink it, Doc? Bless you, Danny, but that ship sailed a long time ago. How many children do you have? None that exist in society. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Oh, don't be. I have hundreds of children that it's been my privilege to help bring into this world. I don't cry about the past and neither should you. Now, eat. Eat! Aquatic life is among the most fecund on the planet. - I'm starving. - Yeah, me, too. To create another life is the most strenuous task the body can ever undertake. You must give it every tool to help it scaffold its mysteries. Well, if you excuse me, I must turn in. Do enjoy yourselves. Be sure to get some rest. - I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you. Marie. - Want to go lay down? - If you want. - Let's make a fire. - Okay. Oh, man. Oh. Shit. Hey! Hey. You still want to lay down? - I think there's something... - Stop thinking. [sultry synth-pop music Who's there? The doctor wishes to see you. The doctor wishes to see you. The doctor wishes to see you. - Good morning. - Morning. You wanted to see me? Uh, yes. Uh, walk with me. I like to talk with, uh, each of my charges in an informal setting at first. It helps to ease the rigors of treatment. Okay, what, uh... what did you want to talk about? You see this little sapling? Do you know what it is? A bush? Arbor vitae. It seems so small and inconsequential, does it not? I mean, yeah, I've seen more impressive bushes. That's exactly it. These little runts are the fastest growing trees in the world. Given abundant sun and water, they'll soon tower over us. But right now... any weakling could easily tear this out with his bare hands. Sorry, I'm not following. Beginnings are delicate things. Just as I protect them, they will shelter me. Like I nurture you, you will nurture your new child. I'm sorry. No disrespect, but I've had a lot of doctors, and I've, um... tried everything. I know what they did to you. The travesty of that botched delivery. It infuriates me that doctors like that are permitted to continue their practice. You won't have that heartbreak here. But you must trust me... and trust the process. I'll do anything you say. Then success is all but yours. Get the pistol out. What are you doing? They're quite invasive this year. Paralysis. I'm a doctor. I can't let any creature end its life through trauma. No matter what the nuisance... it must be done humanely. Wait. He killed it? Yeah, with a syringe. He... He said it was... it was like some pest control or something. Well, it is the country, I know they cull the animals out here from time to time, so maybe that's it. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. - It was weird. - You're overthinking it. It's time for your appointment. Come with me. whirring] Okay, you're done, you're done. Hold out your tongue. Ah... Excellent! Any swelling or discomfort? Any reactions at all? No, no, Doctor. Nothing bad. I just... Well, I've been having a lot of energy and I've been feeling these really, really... heightened sensations. Sexual? - Yes. - That's wonderful. Your body's blooming, signaling its readiness. Oh. Really? Well, that's great. Izzy's gonna be stoked. Let her know we're ready to move forward to the next stage. Wow. Welcome. Please step up. What is this? I call it the gen-dine. And what does it do? Many things, but today we're scanning. It's safe? More than safe, it's rejuvenating! I've never seen anything like it. Of course not. It's the only one of its kind in the entire world! It uses a combination of ultraviolet light, high frequency sound... ...and beta particles to regenerate the follicles. I'm certain you have had far too many of these examinations, so I'll do my utmost to make you as comfortable as possible. Danny, I trust you're empathetic, because this is an indignity that no man has to suffer. Hey. I'm here for you, baby. I read the medical reports. I'm sorry. It must have been very difficult for you. For you both. Why are you apologizing? It's not your fault. I'm apologizing... because I know they never do. Now, you're gonna feel some pressure. There is much tissue damage. Is everything okay? You are a viable candidate. - Viable? - Mm-hmm. Wow, that's... that's a really big needle. Don't be intimidated by the size, it's what's inside that counts. No, that... that's too big! Yeah, no, if she's uncomfortable, let's just... No need to be so dramatic. Now I'm going to repair the uterus. It's just some stem cells. There. Nothing to worry about. Uh, there's just one more thing, my boy. - Me? - I said this was a partnership. Tag, you're it. I'm gonna go get changed, okay? Don't worry, the boys have it easy. Yeah. I'll catch up with you later. Okay. So, what do you need to check, exactly? The same as in any measurement: quality and quantity. That's a weird way to spell "vagina." Hey! Here. - What's this? - I don't know, some kind of Brazilian restorative. It's good for you. And yummy. Drink it. Drink it. Hey, was there anything weird about that exam? - Anything odd? - No. What about that machine? What was that like? Mm... A little tingly. That's all. You're telling me everything was totally normal? You laying naked on the machine and him chatting you up while... prodding you? Was that hard for you to watch? No, I'm just checking. What's up, Danny? It just didn't seem aboveboard to me. Like it almost felt like he was flirting with you. What?! He's, like, 100 years old. I get it, that was weird for you to watch, but... I... I think it was sweet of him to include you, no? Yeah, maybe you're right. Just... I thought he was enjoying it. Ew, Danny, why... why would you put that in my head? We're getting medical treatment from a world-class physician and you're going down the jealousy route? I get that he's eccentric, but don't forget, this place is our last shot. I don't know if I can have you in the room anymore if you're gonna keep freaking out like this. Yeah. Yeah. Just go with the flow. Chaturanga. Oh. Oh, yogi, man. Oh, please. Ow, oh, God. Yogi man... Psst. Not one bad day job, is it? Oh. You'll thank me later. Up dog. Oh, no. You can do it, Mel. No, I don't plank. Baby, just get down, babe. - Shut up. - Up dog. - Okay. - Inhale. - Ow. - Down dog. Exhale. Oh, dear. It's good for the baby. They sure do get the blood pumping, don't they? Yeah, I'm not so sure about that. Oh, you will be. Ugh. Just look at 'em. Like two little kitty cats playing in the Sun. Meow. Ah, what a waste. At least we've got a good guy to girl ratio, though, right? I love my wife, man. She's all I need. Right. Right. So, you're saying you have no desire to watch those two... make out? Eyes front, soldier. I'm kidding. Relax. Funny. Why are you not drinking your drink? I am, see? - Yummy. - Good. 'Cause I want to show you something. Come on. Baby, what... Ah! What are you doing? Just a little love bite. Hmm? I'll kiss it, make it better. What'd I say? What? - Hi. - Mm. How are you feeling? Oh, like I was ravished by an animal. Oh, God, I really hope they don't charge us for that. Oh, shit. What're you doing? I'm late. What're you doing? Oh, God. I'll see you later, okay? When are you coming back? Marie! Oh, God. Marie! Hey, Marie! Oh! Hello. Can I help you? Uh... have you seen my wife? No, you are scheduled at 11:00. Right. Did you have an accident? Oh, that? No, no, that's... that's... that's nothing. Please ready yourself. Jeez. Privacy. Ah, shit. What's this gonna... Huh. Again? All vitals are progressing well. I believe you have a good chance at gestation, and soon. So, how do you feel? Good. Really good. Hey. Hey. We're in great shape. Isn't that right, Doctor? I would say excellent shape. The uterine damage is healing and the viable follicles nearly developed. Isn't that great? It's wonderful. Okay, well, I'll, uh, leave you boys to it, huh? You know the drill. Here you go. Excellent volume and consistency. You're really coming along. Coming along? Where was I? How is the new diet and environment treating you? Good, uh... Really good, actually. Uh, I don't know how to quite say this, but... my... - Oh. - ...has been off the charts. Oh, that's common. What do you guys put in those drinks anyways? Spanish fly? Cantharadin? No, no, Danny, that's highly toxic. So, then, what do you use, exactly? I won't bore you with the composition, unless you're familiar with orgo and biochem. - No, not really... - Ah, very well. Bet a lot of people would buy this stuff. Does it look like I'm motivated by commercial interests? You seem to do pretty well for yourself, Doc. That's why I'm treating you and your wife for free? - What's in it for you, then? - It's not for me. It's for humanity. With the falling birth rates and the rise of congenital problems, the work we do here is of vital importance to the species. Species? That's a bit grandiose. Our breakthroughs have the potential to shift our understanding of life forever! Breakthroughs? You mean, you're still doing research? Danny, I appreciate an inquisitive mind, but the tone of your questions is getting tiresome. I take copious notes on the efficacy of treatment. - What scientist would not? - Yeah, sure, Doc. Of course... Danny, let me ask you a question now. Are you sure you're ready to be a father? Me? Yes. I love my wife. Hmm. The feeling is incredible and sometimes last for hours. Wow. No side effects? Not that I've felt. When do I get to that level? You'll get there when you're ready. So, have you been feeling a little more... I guess. Isn't that a little weird for medical treatment? Not for what we're trying to do. We were curious about what all the extra activities were about. He's sometimes a little much. But I like that he's different. Our other doctors never seemed to care, but with Dr. Lands... we're special. Yeah, I felt that, too. Honestly, I didn't think I, um, had another chance. We're here with you, girl. Thank you. So... has Danny been okay? Mostly well. What do you mean? How's he been taking the treatment? - That's good. - Why? Some people aren't as ready as they may say. Right, but Danny found this place. Did he think this place was a guarantee? I don't know. There you are. Hey. - Hey. - Hello, ladies. Uh, can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah. What's up? Uh, alone. - Okay. - Sorry. - Come on. - Ow. Hey! Easy, buddy. She's not your property. I'll bring her right back, ladies. Come on. Look, I've been noticing more and more things that just don't make sense. I mean, everything's different. What exactly are you worried about? Don't you get the feeling that we're being watched? By the staff or whatever they are? No, it's more than that. You remember that lamp we broke? Yeah, what about it? It didn't look like a lamp on the inside. I don't know, it's just a feeling, but I, uh... I think we should go. You're the one that told me to have some hope... - I know. - and now that things are starting to progress, you want to go? Are you sure you want a baby? Yes, I'm sure, Marie. I love you more than anything. It's this place that I'm not so sure about. Look, I can't put my finger on it just yet, but something is going on. Okay, I'll check the closets for a monster. I'm serious. Okay. Fine. I will. - Okay. - Promise. - I swear. - Okay, come on. What did you just say? What? Dance with me, Danny. Dance with me. Dance with me. Dance with me, Danny! Oh! This is all so lovely. Yeah, it's so nice. Hey, what is healthy living without a little outdoor action, eh? Hey, oh-ho-oh, I got us all some fruit. Grapes, bananas, the works. Attend to me, Steve. All right. Oh. Here you go, sweetie. Here you go, yeah. Guys, what's up with this treatment? It's worth every penny. You'd know about that, right, Izzy? Except for having to hang out with you. Oh, shush. You love me. I'm the one male you can throw all that negativity to. Marie, how are you feeling? This is all too perfect. I mean, who wouldn't love this? Right, but is all this really necessary for a medical treatment? Perhaps, perhaps not. I believe everything that affects the mother affects the embryo. So, why not surround her with beauty and bliss? But Doc, there's no baby yet. So... are we just... dangling this idea in front of us so we believe it? Oh, Danny, have some faith. Marie, you have faith, don't you? I do. Well, I don't know about y'all, but I got so much faith that I am gonna pull some of the Earth down into my womb so we can make a baby. I know what you're saying! Do you want to channel some rays with me? Oh, please put it... Oh, the... all of it... - There we go! There we go. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to drink more. Steve... No, I'm not. No. That's a little... I have a little surprise for you. Where are we going? - Away. - Oh. Okay. ♪ Take me away... ♪ - Bye! - ♪ Into the woods ♪ ♪ Keep watch ♪ ♪ Keep watch ♪ ♪ For the leprechaun ♪ Oh, there they go. You ready? - For what? - A picnic! - Hey! - Hey. Hi. Just having a little fun. [soft music - Hey. - Hmm? I think I forgot something. - Okay? - Okay. I'll see you soon. - Mm-hmm. I'll be right back. - Mm-hmm. - Hi. - Hey. [suspenseful music Ah, what the... ah. Okay. Huh. Wonder if... Still got it. Let's see now... What the... What the... That mother... Doctor... - Hey, did you find it? - Uh, yeah. Do you wanna take a little walk? Oh, no. Now, we call foul. Yeah, babe. Give me a minute. We're going to sleep soon. Okay, so Izzy, you were saying? Oh, just that Blu will definitely make a better mother than me. Right, but how... how does that work? Because you're both the mom. The ovum merge uses both our eggs but only mitochondrial DNA from one. What she means is it just... Marie, I need to speak to you. - Fine. - Come on. Sorry. I'll be back. What's going on? Shh. - What's up? - I was right. - About what? - He's watching us. Of course he's watching us, he's our doctor. No, no, there are cameras everywhere. No camera... I don't see any cameras. Look, that's my point, Marie. They're hidden. I saw the feed in his office. - You broke into his office? - Shh! Yeah. You know you can get us kicked out of here, right? - Did you think about that? - Wait, hold on. You don't care that he's watching us? Marie, in our bedroom. If he was watching us, then why didn't you run into him? - I... I don't know. - Exactly, exactly. 'Cause he's asleep, like I need to be soon if we're going to keep up with this regimen, okay? So please, stop being a weirdo. Geez... Hey. Hey. Just wanna sleep. Really? Can we... No, shh. I'm tired. - We need to talk. - Go to bed. - Marie. - Shh. - Marie. - Shh. Go to bed. Hey, Marie. Marie? There's the Sleepyhead. A flute for Danny, please. Are you sure I can't have just one sip? Mel, I'm sorry, but we take no chances here. Wh... What's the occasion? I'm gonna be a father! Danny, won't you join us in a toast to the happy couple? Isn't it amazing? Right. To more beautiful babies. To more beautiful babies! Mm-hmm. Thank you. It has come to my attention... that we are doubly blessed. No way. Hmm. No way. No need for all that. It's a happy occasion, after all. Yeah. - We did it! - Yeah. A toast to Marie. To Marie. Congratulations. Thank you. Oh, shit... Shit. Oh, my God. The delicate spark of life. We must nurture that spark into a fire - and the fire, an inferno. - Marie. Shh, this is about what we have to do next. And the role of the father is key. The heavenly vessel that is woman carrying the light of divinity. Who must care for her? Pay homage to her? It's you. And you. What about you? Are you also like a father? Is that what you consider yourself? Is that why you're watching us? - Danny. - You know, from the cameras you have all over the place? All I do, I do for your care... You all know he's got cameras hidden throughout the entire house? That he watches and records your every move, - even in your bedrooms. - Is that true? Danny, what's gotten into you? Have you had your tonic today? - I'm through with your tonics, - Danny! your machines, and the poking and prodding! Doctor, what's he talking about? Can't you see he's unstable? Unstable? Unstable? I'm not the one giving people God knows what to drink. I didn't sign up to be your lab rat. No, you are my patient and you will respect this place! Your outbursts are endangering the harmony of the new mothers here. Please sit down. Danny, sit down. Sit down. Stop. Danny! Danny! Ever since we got here, you've been acting strangely. Be honest with me. Do you still want a baby? Yes, of course. Then, what are you doing? I mean, this... All of this is wrong, whatever he's got going on, it's all wrong. Do you still love me? More than anything. Then please, stop this. - We finally have a shot. - I know. - Don't mess it up. - I won't... mess it up. Please, listen to me. We will have a baby. We will have a baby. But we don't need to do it here. Wrong, Danny! This is the only place you can do it. Unless you don't really want one? What? What are you still doing with that? Do you remember it? Danny, stop upsetting her! We made a baby together. You made a baby without this doctor. You and me. That's all we need. - Please? - Okay. I'm sorry, I... Thank you for your hospitality but I, uh... We, uh... We're being too disruptive for the delicate work here. I... We have to go. But you cannot! - Excuse me? - Weren't you listening to me earlier? Your pregnancy is just beginning. Can't you prescribe me something and I'll take it at home? I would if I could, but the gen-dine is here. It's key to this. If you leave here now, your baby will die. Are you willing to take that chance? No. Marie, I'll ask you one last time. Do you have faith? I do. Hey. May we please sit down? Sit down. No, please. No. Everyone... we're going to do a breathing exercise here to calm our nerves. Danny, you can join or you can leave, but you will not be disruptive again. I'm not leaving my baby. Won't you join me, Danny? Are you a student of history? A bit. Why? Do you know the origins of the world's space programs? The original ballistics program of von Braun for Germany? Do you know the details of his past? What's your point? That past includes thousands, if not tens of thousands who suffered and died in the cold, wet mines of metalwork. Yeah, the guy was a Nazi rocket engineer. Are there any more historical villains you'd like to discuss? I know you've been snooping in my lab. Whatever you think you've seen, I'm asking you to put it behind you for the sake of your wife and your child. Is that what you wanted to talk about? Because I should really get going to bed. I feel you've become critical of my methods. Who am I to judge, Doc? I mean, you've obviously gotten results. I bring light to those who are bereft of it. Is that not a worthy task? Sure, Doc... but what's that have to do with spying on people? The more data I have, the more I can help... What kind of data do you get from watching people fuck? Are you certain you want to conceive? Because questions have been raised. If you try any of your bullshit with Marie, I'll... You'll what? Don't try me. Where am I? It's a little late for questions. You should've thought of that before you started creating all these problems for me. You... Oh, don't fight the anxiolytic. It's not as if you're gonna remember any of this, anyway. Now, there's just one more thing we need from you. No... No. You're not a cooperative guy, are you Danny? Not like your lovely wife. She's much better. We like her, don't we? Marie? Oh, God. So, I had a dream and we were back at my childhood home and, like, my friend, Kate, was there... Where's Marie? Oh, come on, you guys are gonna ignore me? Hey, hey, look. Some of us want a peaceful environment for treatment. Fucking charity case. Sorry. Have you guys seen Marie? What? You guys hate me, too? I believe she's with Dr. Lands. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. Did any part of the doc's treatment ever feel off? The examination or treatment ever feel not right? Now that you mention it... no. Danny, he is a goddamn genius. He's with Marie now? Oxygen supercharges the body's regenerative powers. It helps to make the baby strong within you. What are you doing to her? Why does she have a mask on? No, I don't have to explain my methods to you. Hey! Stop that! What are you doing? We're getting out of here, baby. Will you stop that? Danny! I should've done this a long time ago. We're leaving, honey, we're leaving. Come on. Don't... Don't touch her. We're leaving. Know what's good for you, - you'll leave too. - Stop! Nobody's going anywhere. We must have calm for the gestation. Come on. - Stop that! - Wait! You can't do that. - You're with him? - I'm with the baby. You're all in on it? Danny, stop. You're acting crazy. Stay out of my way. Doctor, what is that... Oh! Dammit, everyone upstairs! Stop that! - Sebastian! Stop them! - Come on. We have to get her! That mad man is taking them away from us. Who are you? Danny! Danny... - Run! - What about you? I'll be fine! Get help! Marie! Ah! Shit! I know you're out here somewhere. Come back to the Institute. This is just a big misunderstanding. All that stress and tension... It's not too late to have a healthy baby. Is that what that thing is? Why so quick to judgment? I admit he has some imperfections, but then again, don't we all? I think he's unique and beautiful. He's an abomination! That's not very nice of you, Danny. You might hurt his feelings. Seba, hold him there! Hold him still. - Let him go. - You sure about that? Doesn't seem like he knows how to swim. He's all that I have left. Is this your son? Oh, you couldn't possibly understand. Please bring him to shore. Drop the gun and back away slowly. Drop it now! Okay, back up! Find her. She's the important one. Help! - The fuck do you want? - I... What the fuck are you trespassing on my property for? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I... People are chasing me. I don't know where I am. Help me. - Help you? - Yes. How the fuck I'm supposed to do that? I... I don't... My husband and I, we're at a facility nearby... a... a medical facility. - And they won't let us leave. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, a fucking medical facility? What are ya, a Goddamn junky? No, no, we're lost... I don't give a shit. Fuck I care if you're lost. Look, I don't want no part of any of this bullshit so get the fuck out of here, lady. - Please, I'm pregnant. - Oh, horseshit. Yes. No, I'm serious. Please, please help me. For real? You ain't fucking with me? All I need is to make a phone call. - That's all I need. - Well, I don't have a fuckin' cell phone. What you think? I want cancer of the dick and balls? Jesus Christ. What? What? All right. Look, just calm down, lady. All right, look, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. There's a payphone at the gas station down the road a piece, all right? I'll give you a ride down there... - Ah! - Ah! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me, get off me! Get off me! Look at me. - Did he hurt you? - No. - You okay? - Yeah. Hold this. Come on, baby. Let's move. - What? What? - Oh, God. Come on, we gotta keep going. Go? Go where? Where? We pick a direction and we keep walking until we find someone, come on. I... I can't anymore, I can't anymore. Baby, come on, please. I can't, I can't. Baby, just a little further, we gotta keep going. - Just hold on. - Hey. My stomach hurts, hold on. Look, look, look, look. I told you. - Help! - Help! - Hey! - Oh, my God. Over here! Hey, could you help us out? Oh, my God. Thank God. Thank God. Hey, we could really use your help, man. Hey, could you help us out? You won't believe the night we had... - Danny. - Thank you. Danny. No! Stop! Stop it, stop, you're hurting him! No! Danny! No, no, no! No! - Danny! - Stop! Danny! No, no, no. Stop! No! There, it's going to be okay. - What? - I'm sorry it turned out this way. No, no, no! No! Gently, gently. Gently. No! No! No! No! Danny! The subject is a 31-year-old female. The C-section is standard. Welcome to this cold, new world. Do you want to meet our son? You want to meet your mommy? Don't you?
