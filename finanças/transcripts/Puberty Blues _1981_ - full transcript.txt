The Mackerel Beach Hilton. - [Sue] It's great, look at this Danny, lots of rooms. - [Danny] Who owns this place? - Don't know, it's a holiday house. They never come here. - It's better than study. - No thanks. - Do you want to smoke? - What's that? - Coke. - Garry, where'd you get that? - Down the pub. - Where'd you get the money? - I hocked my old man's cassette player. - You oaf. - Don't worry, I'll get it back. - Ah, shit. Sturdy chair. - Do a line, mate? - No thanks. - You two could stay here tonight, couldn't they, Deb? - I suppose so, nobody would know. - I don't mind. - What's wrong? - I don't like you doing that. - Kissing you? - You know what I mean. - Will you come here tonight? - Might not be able to get away. - You can sneak out? - My olds would really freak if they found me missing. - Well, we might as well go, there's no surf or anything. - [Debbie] Surfing, that's all you ever think about. - No it's not. You know it's not, Deb. I really want you to come here tonight. (light crashing) (crickets chirping) - Hey. - Get back to bed. - I'm going to tell mom. - You do and I'll kick your teeth in. - Give me 50 cents or I'll scream. - Okay, okay, I'll give you 50 cents. - [Sue] Come on, Deb. - Not now, later. Get back to bed. Hi. - [Sue] We're lucky we got here at all, Debbie's little sister - - Shh, just watch this, it's a top show. (muffled speech) How are you? - Good. - How are you? - Found some blankets and sheets. Would you like a drink of juice or something? - No thanks. - We found some teas in the kitchen. Be back. (birds chirping) (waves crashing) I really like you, Deb. - I like you too. - I mean, I really like you. - I've got to go outside. Give it to me and I'll throw it away while I'm there. - It's gone. - What do you mean? - [Garry] I can't find it. (laughing) - [Debbie] Oh, rats, let's hope we find the soddy thing. (laughing) I can feel something. - Where? - There. - Oh shit, it's the last time I use one of those bloody things. - Debbie, quick. The sun's coming up. Quick, jump in some clothes. - Morning. - Hurry up, your parents will freak. (chattering) - [Debbie] Nothing. - [Garry] Jesus, how many days is that? - [Debbie] Six. Tracy reckons you should start worrying when you're more than three days overdue. - [Garry] Well, what are you going to do? - [Debbie] When Cheryl's overdue she rides a horse bareback. - [Garry] Does it work? - [Debbie] I don't know. Some of the girls get Strach to punch me in the stomach. I think I'd rather be pregnant. - [Garry] I've got a science test tomorrow. - Hello, darling, I've got a surprise for you. - What? - We're getting a new car. Aren't you excited? - Oh, yeah. - Honestly Debra, I don't know what gets into you. You've never been the same since you've stopped going to fellowship. Your father's coming home early so we can go and pick it up. - [Debbie] Do I have to come? - Of course you do. I'd thought you be excited about it. Carol is. - Yeah, we'll Carol's only a kid, isn't she? - Just hurry up and get changed, Debra. Come on, Debra, I'm not having you spoil today for your father. - No one cares about spoiling my day. - Oh, come on. - He comes the young lady now. We're waiting to hear what you think of the color. - Come on, sweetheart, what do you think? - It's alright. - Well, it's better than the old heap, isn't it? - I suppose. - Most young ladies like blue. I bet that's your favorite color isn't is? - No. (honking) - Carol. - Don't worry about it. I bet it's red then. Right? - Ours is the same as this only it's red. - Hope you won't be disappointed, Frank. - [Frank] No, I'm sure you're right. - We're the toilet? - Over there. (chattering) - Check Debbie Vickers with her olds. - Don't know why we had to come to this one. - Why not, it's the closest to home. - Yeah. - Here. - Thank you. What's wrong? - I'm not hungry. - [Carol] I am. - What's she doing now? - Going to the toilet, I think. - She just ... She just went.
