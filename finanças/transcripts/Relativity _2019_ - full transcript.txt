Have you ever had a déjà vu? Have you ever met someone and felt you've known him for a lifetime? All of us know these mysterious phenomena. The explanations go from wrong synchronisations in the brain to reincarnation. I want to give you another one today. Recognising the signature of the true structure of space-time. Relativity says that future and past have the same influence on the present. We call it: Time-symmetrical. One can reverse the time's arrow in any physical equation and it stays the same. Which leads to the question, why we humans remember the past but not the future. I think we do. In the form of dreams and déjà vu. I know the theory sounds ambitious. But I hope that I can convince you during the next hour that my method can quantise the gravitational field without divergence. And how it avoids some paradoxes in understanding quantum mechanics. You made it! I could swop shifts because Eva didn't have to fetch Leon. Thanks. -Hello. -Nora, that's nice. You made it! Hello. - Hello. -Your professor thinks highly of you. -Remember your socks next time. - You'll go to a concert later? - Yes. Do you want to come along? - We already have plans. - But you'll come to Julia on Saturday? - She has the wedding pictures. - Unfortunately, I have to work. Too bad. I wanted to show you the coat. Next time, okay? Thanks. We'll go to her chancery now. - Say hello. - Yes. But do you remember the day when we first met? - That's a stupid question. - Yes. The weather! - It poured down. - So I took the subway. Yes. If the sun had shone, we hadn't been at the same place at the same time. And the weather exists because gas came from the inner earth, 4 billion years ago. So it's the earth's fault? Yes. And the earth exists because of the Big Bang. So how can future and past be separated if something that happened 14 billion years ago is the reason we got to know each other? So it wasn't my decision to call after you again? It was. You could have driven on. What shall we eat? - I don't have my card yet. - The new one still hasn't arrived? - No. - There's a bank on the other side. I think it's still open. - I have a surprise for you. - A surprise? Yes. I didn't just lie around while you worked on your lecture. - I see. - You have to stop! Wait a sec. That's the coolest I've ever seen. Do it again! - I can't do it anymore. - No? - I'll show you later, okay? - You have to teach me! - I promise. - You promise? - Guess how to do it! - How to do it? With magic? - Right. - It was that simple! I'll call the bank for you tomorrow. You won't do it anyway. - There'll be a lunar eclipse tonight. - Really? When? - 3:15, I think. Would you give me your cellphone? My alarm doesn't work. - I wanted to ask you - Put your hands behind your heads! You guys, face to the wall! Get your cellphones out! Now! Put your phones in here! - I have nothing with me. - Your cellphone! - I don't have it! - Give me that! Cellphones in here! Face against the wall! Out! Out! Quickly! - On the ground, cunt! - Can't you see the state she's in? Shut up! Get on the ground! Go on, quick! Everyone on the ground! You, too! Get on the ground! Money! Put the money in there! Hurry! Put it all in there! Shut your puss! What are you doing? Give me your phone, you cunt! Did you call the cops? You called the cops? No! No, please don't! You called the fucking cops! Do you want me to kill you? You fucking cunt! You fucking wanker! Motherfucker! Aron? Everything will be fine. Aron? Look at me. Beginning... What? Help will soon be here. Let's go. For how long haven't you been on the ice? - Six years. - It's like cycling, right? Are you okay? Alright? It's nice to be saved by an ice-princess. Who will be coming? Fellow students, some professors, my parents. How long is your shift? I'll close shop. Let's have dinner then. And then you'll make the presentation again, just for me. To fall asleep? Ava? Ava? Where is she? Ava? Where is she? Where is she? Has she conjured herself away? Ava? Where is she? Hello, Ava! - I'm ticklish. - Where are you ticklish? I didn't know that. Again! What's that? Did you fall? Please, dad. Okay, one more time. Then it's off to bed. Ava, eat up! My bracelet's always open! Mum! - What happened here? - I have to go. Daddy built a time machine. - I thought your shift starts at nine. - It changed. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Is there anyone we can call for you? - Could I wash my hands? - Of course. Over there! Wait! The family is here now. Jenny is so talented! When I think back to how you were at her age! - You have to see her! - We'd love to. For how long have you been together now? In summer it'll be two years. What do you do, Aron? I'm working on my dissertation in physics. Impressive. And you, darling? - You know, she was a princess. - Mum! An ice princess. Her trainer said she'd never seen anything like it. - She'd have made it to the Olympics. - So what, mum? I'm just saying. - There you go. - Thanks. You should have just started again. When I think back to all those years... All those lessons... What's that for? You know it. I think that's more than fair. If you think so. I have to catch my train. Take good care of her. I have to ask. I can't just find out where she works. Hi. - So? - There you are! - I can't stay for too long. - You look shit. - Look into the mirror. - The job kills you. Thanks. You can start at mine again. You can go to him again now. You know, sometimes that's good. It helps you realise that someone's died. Thanks. You can think about it. My shift is about to start Maybe you shouldn't work today. Of course that's your decision, but Hello. - It's the last time. - It's fine. Ava, come! Faster, dad. Faster! I'll be right back, okay? Are you waiting for me, or what? - In that hovel? - Sure. I've always lived here. Ava! Ava, baby! Ava! - Baby! - Dad! My bracelet is gone. How did Jesus like his chicken? What? Cruci-fried. We'd love to meet your mother and her boyfriend. - To negotiate the dowry. - We don't meet too often. Shall we dance? - You? - You? Yes! Sorry, my rhythm is different. Let me hear it. Shouldn't we invite her once? - My mother? - Yes. We now know what we're dealing with, so we can treat it. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be cured with intensive combined chemotherapy in 30-50 percent of cases. We'd now test you as donors for bone marrow and native cells as the chance to find a donor is highest within the family. One moment. Excuse me. Bermann... No, it surely is in the laboratory. Right. Call there first. No, I'll call then. Do you have other relatives who we can test? Yes. There's something else that complicates the whole thing. Some leukemia patients undergo a genetic change. It's called the Philadelphia-Chromosome. It's rare amongst children, but unfortunately your daughter has it. What does that mean? Patients with that anomaly react worse to normal chemotherapy. But for a few years, there has been new medicine. After the treatment their results were very good for the patients. But they're only paid by a private additional insurance. I have to take a look... I see! That's... Your employer. So you're well insured? That's good. Finally some... good news. Is she dead? No, she isn't. Nora isn't doing too well. We have to help her a bit. Come here. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. It's not my fault, either. Hello, bro. Thanks. I owe you one. Sure. They play like shit! The Italians called. The flowers will be delivered at 4. How is your daughter? Everything's fine. - Call me if I should step in again. - Thanks a lot. It's with LED. Why is Aron dead? Do you know why? Because we didn't finish my dinosaur. No, I don't think so. Will he be buried? No! Good. Why? Because worms eat you then and you'll become worm poo. What will happen to him? I think he'll be burned. Will he go to heaven that way? Maybe. And if it rains? It rains Aron! Are we on time today? Yes, it won't happen again. How were the last nights? Good. Except for the delivery from the Italians, everything was cool. I'd like to show you something. I looked into it. Don't get up! Is that you? That's theft and you know it. That... I'm sorry. Sure. - It won't happen again. - Definitely not. Because you don't work here anymore. What? Because of three euros? Morale isn't measured in materialistic worth. And it's not just about the bracelet. Lately, several valuables were stolen. - Electronic devices. - What do I have to do with it? It wasn't me. This job is very important to me. You should have thought about that before. The insurance! Will it keep going? Of course not. Please think about that! My daughter is really ill. We need the insurance. Enough! This is no fun for me, but you leave me no choice! Please, I'll make up for it. Tell me... You should be glad that I won't report you. The bracelet! Yes. Here. I forgot. Where did you get that? I saved it. Nora, don't shit me, that's more than 4,000 euros. I realise that you get stuff from work that disappears again. - Stop it! - It doesn't harm anyone. Don't be so naive. Did you ever have to earn money? What's it for? Nora, what is the money for? - For my mother. - What? She invested so much in me. That's crazy! Crazy! Crazy! That's not your fault! Look at me! If it helps you finish that, I can give you the money. Or lend it to you, or something But please stop it! Okay. Are you nuts? You okay? Be more careful next time. You're early. I don't know whether I can bear this. Baby... - I have to talk to you. - Natan, I don't want to fight anymore. We're in this together. If we stand together, we can do this. Yes. Hello? No, unfortunately not. He's dead. He doesn't need the new card anymore. Just send the documents here. So am I. Thanks. Please record your message. What would you guess? - 800. 900 if he's in a good mood. - How much? How is your daughter? Chemotherapy starts on Monday. Do you remember uncle Louie? Shut up! I'm serious, shut up! This is Aron Richter's voicemail. Unfortunately Aron died, so you can't call him. Nora? It's Christiane. Christiane? I'm sorry I haven't called yet. I'll drive to my mother for a while. If you want to go into the flat, you can... Thanks. Christiane? I'll call you once I'm back, okay? Bye. - Look at this bitch! - Calm down! - Don't touch me! - Otherwise I'll call the cops. - Do you even listen? - Call the fucking cops! It's okay, I'll take care of her. Hey, your phone! - Let's go to mine, I live right there. - Leave me alone! - I've got drugs. - Leave me alone! Don't touch her! What do you want? Is she your girlfriend? I know enough about you. Shut up! - Shall I send the cops to your home? - Don't touch me! No! Aren't you feeling well? Do you want to throw up? You'll feel better then. Shall I show you? It's easy! Shit, nothing! I'll call you a taxi, okay? I'm fine. Fuck. Are you okay? Put your head back. Will you wait for me to fall asleep? Aron? Is it the fear? Breathe calmly. You know, I'm scared as well. I'm scared that a plane crashes and falls on us. Or... that lightning strikes. Although... we'd probably survive that. But... there'd be a fire. The fire department would have to come. They'd try to stop the fire, but they'd forget that we're in here. They'd keep pumping water in here. Until we drown. Luckily we're good swimmers. We'd have a chance. That reminds me that the socket in the kitchen is broken. So the water would conduct the electricity and we'd die from an electric shock. And everybody would think we died from the lightning. Nobody would ever know what really happened. Except for us. Nora... Me too. What's your name? Natan. I remember you. From the bank. It's the second time. What? That you saved me. It doesn't seem you want to be saved. Koppermann from the CID. Are you in? Miss Bach? We've been trying to contact you for days, we really need your testimony. Please open the door. Please call us. Do you already have to leave? Yes, I still have stuff to do. Hi. Why? Did you think nobody would realise? Can I explain it to you? You don't give a shit about your daughter. Baby, stop! Stop, please! - Stop! - Don't touch me! Listen to me! Let me explain! - Do you want to break my nose as well? - Let me explain it! Piss off! - Shall I call the police? - Piss off, motherfucker! Shall he call the police? Sort it out! It can't be that hard. Sorry. Go to 17. I'll take care of this. Would it be that bad? - What? - If he kicked you out. Boy, Nora! I'm glad you're here, otherwise I'd die of boredom. But this isn't really a dream job. Ava? Where have you been so long? I had something to do. Will you forgive me? No? Fine. In that case I have to give the gift to the boy in room three. A gift? You want to see it? There's nothing. - I see. I forgot that it's invisible. - Invisible? You don't like it. - What is it? This is a magic bracelet. - A magic bracelet? - Yes. If you wear it, you'll quickly get healthy again! Really? It has magic powers. Shall I put it on? Is it too tight? Which colour is it? Red. My favourite colour. - Really? So far the treatment works quite well on your daughter. Really? That's a good sign, right? But a colleague from administration just came to me. Is it possible that your job situation's changed? What will the costs be? With 400mg per day, and looking at the treatment time 100,000 euros. If the treatment goes longer, it'll be even more. Until the end of the month it'll keep going like this. And then? Hopefully we'll have found a donor then. They open longer on Thursdays. - How much time do we have? - 5-7 minutes. Where will we get everything? - I know someone. - You know my rules. It's fail-safe! Nothing's fail-safe. You're late. That's Natan. Polito. Okay, come along! Lillith, Bang Bang, PK 50. Which one? This one. Sure? - Yes. - Blank? Just pack them! Yes? Stop that shit! What's this? Give me real ones. You forgot your wallet at mine. Where are you? I'll bring it to you. There still is room in here. Schrödinger's cabinet? Never! Why? Because the plates are already broken, even though they aren't. Not if we open it in space. Ingenious! Have you ever played an instrument? Yes, piano. When I was six. For two weeks. And do you sometimes regret that you stopped? No, do you sometimes regret that you stopped? I think I sometimes rather regret that I ever started. But everything you did brought you exactly here. Hi. Here! Thanks! How about a drink? I was just about to leave. Here's your goulash soup. Enjoy it! Do you want some bread with it? Alright. There you go. - Hi. What do you want to drink? - Vodka. What's wrong with you? You look sad. Did the idiot do something wrong? I'd marry you right away! Kurti, that'd be a bad catch for her. He has pancreas cancer. You want to hear a joke? After three days, a seasick passenger gets on deck again. He looks around and sees nothing but water. He's really shocked and says: We've only made it here? I like it. Natan, show him how it's done! You sing? No! - He's a real talent. - You're mad! Come on, do it! - After all, the lady is here - Exactly. - No way! - Don't let us beg for it. I sing for you, I scream for you I burn and snow for you I forget myself and remember For you, always for you, forever and you I laugh for you, I cry for you I rain and shine for you I relocate the world for you For you, always for you, forever and you I talk for you, I'm quiet for you I go and stay for you I'll paint the skies blue for you For you, always for you, forever and you For you, always for you No matter what you call me, no matter where you sleep I lied so many times for you, I'll even bend the rainbow For you, always for you, forever and you You aren't particularly good. And you aren't particularly nice. Do you do that often? To be honest, I always wanted to be a drummer. Why? I don't know. They always look cool. What happened? I never started. What's the problem? What do you do instead? He works for me. Am I disturbing? I thought you had family business today? How rude of me, my name is Maxi. Nora. Have you known each other for long? Since kindergarten. We're like brothers. And you? How did you meet? Could I talk to you? Come on. See ya. What's your problem? Why didn't you call me back? - Relax! - What's wrong with you? You wanna go somewhere else? Yes. - Nora... - Thanks. For what? For being here. Do you want to move in? What do you think? Rather not. Why? Are you afraid? - Of what? - Because I am the way I am. But I like you because you are as you are. Yes, but you'll get to know me and then you'll think I'm boring and then you won't like me anymore. True. In that case I shouldn't even start liking you, right? Yes, I think that'd be easier. I don't know. I think it's too late for that. But I can stop being in love with you. I just have to snap once. It'll stop immediately. With one snap? I can teach you. You don't have to. You and I that's something special. Everyone thinks they're special. But nothing is forever. All is forever. Hands above the heads! - Get on the ground! - Faces to the wall! Get all your cellphones out. Put the cellphones in here. Empty your bags! Cellphones in here, face against the wall! Out! Out! Get on the ground! Here in the middle! Shut up, bloody shit! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Come on, money! Money! Money! Money! Quick! All of it! Quicker! Quicker! Quicker! Go on! - Shall I kill you now? - What? You fucking wanker! You motherfucker! Come on! Down there! Why was it live ammunition? Why was it live ammunition? Calm down! Calm down, man! Sure. Is he dead? Is he dead? I have to go back! - No! - Let me go! Let me go! I have to go back! - No! - Yes! You won't get us into prison! Take the gun down! Have you noticed anything? - No matter the detail, anything? - No. Let's start from scratch again. Excuse me! Koppermann. Why? He should stay where he is. Excuse me. He's our son. I'll call the doctor. He'll pick you up. Dad? Where's the woman? Sleep on. I was allowed to eat ice cream today. - Really? - Two scoops. - Which flavour? - Strawberry and vanilla. And mum said that once I'm well again I can have as much ice cream. Did you want ice cream as well? Dad, you're crushing me! Next time, I'll keep some for you. Yes? Sleep now! Bye. 39 cents. Exactly right. We'll see each other later, right? Sure. Why not? - Is that him? - Yes. Yes. - I'm off then. - Yes. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Are you a stalker or what? I don't think so. You were talking about oatmeal. Are these the right ones? Yes, thanks. I've got something for you as well. You kept it! Coincidence. I don't believe in coincidences. Why? They're just a lack of information. Are you nuts? Are you sure? Nora, don't mess up. - Hello. - Hello. Come along, the nurse will be here soon. Do you have any information yet? There you are! Are you here for the test? Can we meet? I'll pick you up. Get out. Kneel down! Do you really want to do this, Nora? On your knees! He never wore socks. Not even in winter. On the sidewalk he always walked on the road-side. As if he was scared I'd run onto the street. Why? Why did you do it? Tell me! Why? For Ava. URGENT DONOR MATCH How does it feel? One doesn't feel a lot, as one sleeps. Is that her? Daddy. It worked. - What? - The bracelet. - When did you move here? - Almost a year ago. - Why did you move here? - Next question! - What do you like to eat? - Oatmeal. - Where do you have to go now? - To work. - What's your job? - Nothing special. - What's nothing special? - Earning money. - Why? - Why I earn money? Why don't you do something special? Not everyone can do something special. You could. So what's your job? - In a supermarket. - Why? New challenges all the time. Sometimes the bar code doesn't work and I have to type it in manually. And the products in the shelves always have to be at the very front. And I like to work with people. - Did you always want to do that? - You'll do it. - He'd like that. - Is this the last one? - Yes! I'll finish this. We'll wait for you downstairs. Do we know each other? What's your name? Why? That's a weird name. Nora. Really? My end is your beginning. I have the same name. Only backwards. - I have to go. - Okay. Take care. - You too. - You too. Hey, Aron! RELATIVITY
