In the beginning, there was darkness. A world changed at the flip of a switch. Suddenly, the darkness was gone. The power had arrived. The age of electricity had begun. It moves us. It delivers us. It connects us. We depend on it for food and medicine, to make everything from the cars we drive to the world we live. We are linked, slaves tied to a leash made of copper. Our money, our security, our entertainment, forever changed. What then would we do if that power suddenly went out? - Watch out! - Oh, jeez! TJ! Are you trying to kill me or something? Sorry, I'm just late for work, like usual. When are you gonna start enjoying your summer, like a normal person? Two days, Hannah. You know what happens in two days. Yeah, rub it in. Ugh! All right, I gotta go. I gotta make that money. - But- - See you later! Where's our adventure, TJ? Can't wait all summer! You better have a good excuse, Miss Bradcock. Greg's gonna have your head. I've got five oil changes and an alignment waiting, and it ain't even noon. It's, like, 9:02. Get off me. Well, last I checked, your shift began at 9:00 a.m. How about instead of riding my ass, you pull the change into bay two and shut the hell up? Bay three. And watch your back. Your day's coming. Ooh. What a jerk. TJ, you almost done with that one? TJ! What? - Yeah, yeah, I'm almost done. - Hurry up! I've got a Honda out front, needs brought into bay two. Okay, I'll get it. Now! Sir, your card didn't go through. You're gonna have to call your bank. - Can you run that again? - Where are the keys? Sir, I've tried it three times. Greg. Keys. We do take cash. Aaron. Where is my Chevy? It's done. I took care of it for you. You're good. What did you do? Just trying to help you out. Taylor Jo! You did the oil change on that Chevy, right? Yeah, like an hour ago. I see. Did you maybe forget something? What are you talking about? The oil, TJ! You forgot the goddamn oil! - No, that's impossible. - The customer just called. Her motor seized up on the side of the goddamn freeway. What the hell am I supposed to do? Okay, I can explain. It was Aaron. - He's the one who- - Look, it's just one thing after another with you. And I'm sick of it. You're fired. - Greg- - Get your shit and get out! Looks like you'll be needing this. Rot in hell. Nice working with you. What's wrong? Come in. Come in. Sit down. Just breathe. Just breathe. That's it. Deep and slow. Now, tell me, what's going on? I got fired. What? I didn't even do it. It was... - The car, it was Aaron- - Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What's going on? You can't live like this. You don't have put up with his shit. Who are you calling? - My dad. - Hannah. What is he gonna do? If you're suggesting what I think... I can't do that. We're sorry, you have- - Hannah. He'll know what to do. What is it? Please check the number and try your call again. We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and try your call again. I mean, my dad lives on his phone. He never has it turned off. Where are your parents? They're on a business trip in New York. Why? The outage started just after 3:30 this afternoon, spreading across the Northeast. Portland, Boston, and New York remain without power. A faulty transformer is said to be the cause of the blackout, but details have yet to be released. Crews are working to resolve the issue, but, still, no word on how long the power will be out. In other news, the U.S. Stock Exchange was forced to close due to the outage. The market has not been closed since Hurricane Sandy struck New York - in October of 2012. - I made dinner. Swiss steak. You really slaved away all day on that one, huh? So how was everyone's day? I don't wanna talk about it. They say the blackout is spreading. Hospitals are out of power. Cars out of gas, blocking the freeways. Panic in the street. Wonder if the Russians are involved? Many grocery chains have established purchase limits on food items- - So you're really gonna take his side, aren't you? He's been working for me for 12 years. I've been your daughter for 14. Doesn't that count for shit? Watch your mouth. Greg, I need that money. I almost got enough for a car. You're not being fair. You know, maybe I overreacted. Maybe you can show me how sorry you are. I may reconsider. You remember that one thing? Stop it. - You know. - Stop. You promised you wouldn't. You think it's fair the agency stuck us with you for this long? I raised you, I fed you, I put a goddamn roof over your head. Everything the law requires. Least you can do is show me some goddamn respect. You're not even my real father. Well, thank God for that. I hate you. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Maybe it's North Korea. Definitely North Korea. So after you left yesterday, I did some research. And it turns out, you don't have to stay there anymore, if you don't want to. Hannah, can I use your phone? Mine's not working. Hey, TJ. How you doing? God. Just go away. I just wanna use your phone. What's wrong with yours? I can't get a signal. Try dialing your asshole. Sorry about that. It's okay. What do you think? I don't know, Hannah. I don't think it's great idea. I mean, just hear me out. You turn 16 tomorrow, which means you're legally old enough to apply. Yeah, but emancipation? Where would I go? I don't even have a job anymore. How would I pay rent? I mean, you can stay here. We have a spare room. I appreciate that, I do, but I don't think that's a great idea. Why, because of Patrick? I can handle my brother. And besides, don't think about that right now. Just go home, pack up a few things, and tell Gina you're gonna spend the weekend here. Look, no one's forcing you to do anything you don't wanna do. Just think about it. Okay. Gina. Door. You're useless. Robert? West Virginia? What are you doing all the way up here? Woo-hoo! You know, we keep meeting like this, I'm starting to think it's destiny. Yeah, in your dreams. Are you okay? You still up for an adventure? How about a road trip? Going somewhere? You had no right, Greg. Uh, yeah, I actually did have the right. What am I supposed to do? Customer's pissed, the motor's shot. Somebody's got to pay for it. I already told you, it wasn't my fault. I need this money. Maybe we can work something out, huh? Hey. Hey! Where do you think you're going?! Staying at Hannah's. Don't remember you asking my permission. Well, I wasn't asking for your permission. Fuck you! No, don't touch me. You don't ever get to touch me. You walk out that door, you're not coming back. Nice knowing you, Greg. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah, absolutely. Jesus. Patrick, get out. This doesn't concern you. Mom and Dad are so gonna kill you. Get out. You ladies have no idea what you're getting yourselves into. You don't even have a license. Somebody's gotta watch out for you. And if you don't want me telling Mom and Dad about your little adventure, then I'm coming too. Damn it, Patrick. We don't need anyone watching out for us. Hannah, it's fine. He can come. So, where we headed? Just don't talk for the rest of the trip, okay? That'd be great. Come on. Where'd you say you found this thing? Why did you really come? What? Why did you come with us? You could've had the house to yourself, and thrown a huge party. Told you why. Expect me to believe you care about us? Think a couple of girls can't fend for themselves? Something like that. Okay. What is it you hope to find, anyway? I mean, West Virginia isn't exactly the center point of civilization. I don't know. Answers, I guess. It's stupid when you think about it. I don't know, I mean, I'd be curious too. Cautious, but curious. For all we know, we could be headed into a cult or some serial killer's freezer. Or both. Charming. Where are we? Not far from the bridge. Are you guys sure you wanna do this? Patrick, this is not your party. You joined us, remember? I'm just asking. Are you gonna be sick or- - I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Just calm down. Stay calm. What is wrong, TJ? - I don't know! - Okay, okay. I think you're having a panic attack. Patrick, get her some water. Please. Yeah. It's okay. You know what? That's it, we're going home. No. No, no, no. TJ, look at you, you're a mess. You don't have to do this. What if they don't wanna see me? They don't want me. TJ, that is not gonna happen. And I'm here with you. All the way. I know it's not a cake, but happy birthday. You gonna be okay? Yeah. R.R. Robert? You know, had a lot of things planned for today. Getting shot? Not one of them. This can't be right. I think we need to go back. I know that name from somewhere. Trust me. Do we just knock? What? Hold on, hold on! Don't shoot. Just one second. Do you know who this person is? Sorry. Do I know you? No, but I sure know you. Are you R.R. Robert? I can't believe you've come. You look just like her, you know? Spitting image. I'm sorry, who are you? The name's R.R. Robert, but people call me Jack. To you, my dear, you can call me Grandpa. How did she die? Cancer. She was so young. Yes, she was. Please, sit. I reckon you're full of questions. What was she like? She loved music. She earned her way playing gigs from Charleston to Columbus, if you believe it. Wasn't much money, but, Lord, she had the voice of an angel. I'd go to see her every chance I got. I wish I could've known her. Oh, my dear, after you were born, everything changed. You were the most important thing in her life. The last one to put a smile on her face. I lost two of my girls when she died. They took you away from me without giving me a chance. You were all I had left of her. I want you to know, if there was any other way, it would've been my honor to have raised you. The Jeep was hers, wasn't it? Yeah. I'd hoped, one day, to pass it to you, to continue her adventure, to be free. I never thought you'd come, then I saw you standing in my door. It was like my Amy had finally come home. I would've loved to hear her play. There's something I wanna show you. Hey, Jack, whatever happened to my father? Your mother's passing hit him hard. He joined the military and I never did see that man again. What is it? Open it. Tapes? Yeah, tapes. You know, music. I'm familiar with the device. What are they? Your mother's music. I want you to have them. I don't know what to say. Happy birthday, Taylor Jo. We recording? All right, this is Amy Robert and this is track four from our new album, "Brave." Ready? One, two, three. ♪ Pick me up for the first time ♪ ♪ I'm thinking and a bottle of cheap wine ♪ ♪ We were laughing at the same jokes ♪ ♪ Bothering the old folks ♪ ♪ And we took down my two-piece that covered us ♪ ♪ Ooh, I'm falling for the boy ♪ ♪ With the girl looking back in his eyes ♪ ♪ And, ooh, I'm falling way too easily and it's scaring me ♪ ♪ Oh, ooh, you got me with my cards on the table ♪ Can you chill with the white trash banjo playing for, like, one second? Thank you. Literally can't get any signal. I mean, is this like a black hole or something? Those things never work out here. You gotta get up higher. I can't even check the weather. You wanna check the weather? Then stick your head out the damn window. Thank you. You know, I couldn't help but notice how clean that jeep is. Too damn clean. What say we get some mud on them tires? Yeah, and maybe check the weather. God. Who uses these roads?! This was logging country. They came here about 10, 15 years ago and cleared out miles of these. You can cross the entire state if you know where to go. Oh, god. What do you think? I could get used to this. Left, up here. Amy used to love to come up here and watch the sunset. She felt like she was on top of the world. What town is that? That there is Buckhannon. Population 5,600. It don't look like much from here, but it's home. I've been here most my life. We best get moving. You don't wanna get caught up here in the rain. Saddle up. TJ? I can feel her. Of course you can. She's apart of you, in here. We best get moving. Great. We just can't sit here. I know a shortcut. Come on, now. Little tight in here. Watch your step. TJ, I can't. - I- - Come on. - Can't, I can't. - Come on. Come on. Patrick, wait. Wait. TJ, I can't do this. Patrick, can you... Calm down. I can't. I can't. Okay. - I'm right here. - Okay. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Okay. You got this. You got this. - I'm right here. - Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Hannah, let's go! Patrick, okay. - I'm right here. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I just can't look down again. Almost there. - We're almost there. - Okay, okay, okay. You're okay. You're doing this. Okay. Almost there. Almost there. Oh, my god, okay. Don't worry, we'll get her in the morning. I don't know who's waiting for y'all back home, but you're welcome to stay here as long as you like. Y'all don't know me, I know that. We'll get your jeep fixed and get you home. Well, let's not all stand out here. I'm hungry. You know how to start a fire? Yeah. Sure. Don't be useless, go get some wood. Well, that should be interesting. TJ, you know I'm with you, all the way, but, like, I'm in enough trouble as it is. If my parents find out about this, they're gonna kill me. Hannah, it's just one night. It'll be okay. I'll get you home. Okay. I just really hope you know what you're doing. So do I. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. Guys. I'm hungry too. What the hell are you doing? All these cabinets, and not one goddamn can of soup! Soup?! Tomato, chicken noodle, anything! Are you drunk? Shit, you are! You have some nerve coming in here like this! You want soup?! Then drive into town and buy your own! I'm out working my ass off all week and have to come home to this shit?! You wouldn't be working at all if it weren't for me! - Hey! - Hey, piss off, old man! Jack? Jack? Are you all right? I'm sorry, Taylor Jo. Did I wake you? You're sorry? Here. What just happened? Who was that? That's just Raymond. He's a little rough around the edges, but you get used to him. And he lives with you? For a time. I'm his AA sponsor. Guess I'm not really doing my job, am I? Look, I'm okay. Go on back to bed. Can't sleep. Seriously, I'll be fine. What about him? He's just had a bad week and comes home a little crocked. He'll sleep it off. That don't make him a bad person. Go on, now. Go back to bed. Okay. Goodnight, Jack. Goodnight, Taylor Jo. Thanks for waking me up, guys. Hannah? Patrick? Hello? Jack? Jack? Hello, TJ. Good morning. Is it? It's damn near lunch. You get that last cord chopped, yet?! I'm working on it! All right? Calm down, old man. Well, get to it! They ain't gonna chop themselves! Hillbilly. You chop some... Lord. Millennials. Zoomers. What? Nothing. You ever fire a gun? No. I see. Nothing wrong with knowing how to defend yourself. It's a crazy world we live in. Hard to know who to trust. Take a look out there. What do you see? I see grass and trees and Patrick making a fool of himself. You know why he's doing that? Probably because you have a gun. That ain't it. I've seen the way he looks at you. I've been round this Earth a time or two. Make sure you have no regrets. You sound like an old man. I am an old man. Our choices define us, makes us who we are. Will you chose to be brave, to be strong, to love? Who will you choose to become? It's 90 degrees out, anyway. Who the hell needs a fire? Okay. You got this. You can do this. Are you fricking kidding me? Okay, I've got this. I've got this. Did it before, I can do it again. Okay. Just like when TJ was here. Just think of TJ. Okay, okay. Let's not look down. Yeah, you're gonna get to high ground. You're gonna get to high ground. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine. You'll be safe. Oh, my god, okay. Okay, bad idea. Bad idea. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, boy! Where's my wood?! Shit. Shit. Help! TJ! TJ! - TJ, help! - Hannah? Help! Help! Help! TJ! TJ! Patrick! Hannah! Help! Help. TJ, help! Someone help! TJ! Hannah! Help me! TJ! Help! I got you. I got you. Okay. Oh, my god. What happened? Just Hannah. I need to see your phone. I don't have it. We can't stay here, okay? We need to leave, right now. What has gotten into you? I need to show you something, okay? Okay. What is it? We never should've come here. Hannah! I can handle her. You two best get going. - No, let me go talk to her. - It's getting late and you got a hike ahead of you. Don't worry about her. She's had enough of the outdoors for one day, I think. What can I do? Mm. Think it's the wiring. Car's been in storage a long time. Rats. That does not look good. Can you fix it? I could try. Can you hand me the electrical tape? - Here you go. - Thanks. So what do you think? Nothing's impossible. No, I mean about Jack. All of this. You think we should leave too, don't you? Mm. Thought crossed my mind. It's amazing. Should hold for now. She just needs a little love. You think you can fix anything. Willing to try. It's been hours. Shouldn't they be here? It's not just a stroll down the road. Give them time. You seem worried. Should I be? Do you ever think about the past? Your past. What got you here, to this moment? Sometimes. What's your first memory? And not something from pictures. Like a real memory. When I was about three or four, I grabbed a bottle of baby powder, shook it all over the room like snow. It made such a mess. And I'm pretty sure I hid under the basement steps for about a week. I don't know why I remember that. What about you? What do you remember? I remember playing hide and seek when I was a kid, with my foster parents. I would hide in the closet 'cause I didn't think they'd ever find me there. Greg eventually caught on, and he started to hide in the closet with me. And put his hands... - Jesus, that's not okay. - I don't know why I'm telling you this. It's stupid. Hey, TJ. When I look at you, I see a girl who's not afraid of anything. I just wish she was still here. Yeah. You have Jack, and you have Hannah, and me. Why did you come here? When I was little, when Hannah was born, the moment I saw her, I knew that I was gonna keep her safe and protect her. I know that's embarrassing or whatever, but I would do the same for you. What the hell was that? Uh. What did you do? Just forget it. I'll deal with it later. Let's go. Where the hell have you been? Is everyone okay? Just a power outage. Probably the damn squirrels chewing on the wires again. No, it wasn't the squirrels. We saw it. You saw what? A bright blue explosion. Like a welding arc, but bigger. And then everything went black. Do you have a radio? What's going on We don't think the blackouts are accidental. We think we're under attack. Attack? That's ridiculous. I'm sorry, but were you there? Because we saw this with our own eyes. I've been working for the power company for 10 years. Just a blown transformer. That's what you saw. Jack, I don't know what you've heard, but shit like this has been happening for days. It's called a cascading blackout. Combination of old equipment and too much strain on the system. Been keeping us busy for days. Jack, are you sure this thing works? 'Cause I can't get anything. Try AM. Okay, now, you're really freaking me out. Listen, what happened in 2003 is not the same situation. New York, Boston. 12 hours later, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit. In a blackout, whole sections of the grid go down in a matter of minutes, not days. This was orchestrated, timed, planned. People are panicking. How long is it going to take for you to realize... Hold on. Hold on. I'm getting additional reports of new outages from Virginia to Tennessee. It's spreading across several more states. People, if you are listening and you still have power, I urge you, stock up on food and water. I will continue to- So, like, this is the end, isn't it? Hi, TJ, this is your mama. Not really sure how to go about this, but here it goes. If you've found this tape, that means you're old enough to hear what I'm about to say. I have stage IV breast cancer. It's very invasive. The doctors say that I've only got a couple of months. I know you're going to grow into a strong, beautiful woman. And I'm sorry I won't be there for you, honey, to hold your hand one more time. I can't imagine what you must be thinking. I wanna tell you everything. I wrote a song I wanna play for you. I want you to know that... Well, maybe I'll just let the song do the talking. ♪ Mm ♪ ♪ I wished on a star ♪ ♪ And here you are ♪ ♪ Sent from above ♪ ♪ My little dove ♪ ♪ If I could've said hello a little sooner ♪ ♪ If I could've done it, I would ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, believe me, I would give anything ♪ ♪ For some more time with you in my world ♪ ♪ Mm ♪ That was beautiful. Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude. You wanna be alone? No. Still nothing? We're gonna be all right. What's happening, Patrick? Feel like I'm falling apart. Hey. Hey. What's going on? Nothing. Doesn't seem like nothing. You wanted to tell me something? What is it? I was scared, TJ. You left me. I needed you, and you left me here all alone. You said that you wanted to go home. I just went to get the jeep so I could get it fixed and get it running. Mm, and did you fix it? Not yet, but I'm- - How convenient. Hannah, you're not being- - You know, whatever. Hannah! You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We have some Band-Aids here. So, what's your story, miss? What's a girl like you doing in a place like this, huh? Looking for a little adventure? Can you please stop? Stop what? Ew! I said stop! You're gonna need these more than me. Who the hell do you think you are? Jack's granddaughter. Who the hell are you? This was a mistake. You shouldn't be here. Morning, sweetheart. Hey, I found two boxes of MREs in the garage. Are we sure these are okay? Where's Ray? Have you seen him? Where the hell you at, Raymond? You know what's going on out there. Get your shit and let's go! Calm down, man. I thought it was handled. There's a situation - up at Foley Mountain. - Relax! I've got it under control. Get in the truck. Who's that? That's Raymond's boss from the power company. He's pissed. Yeah. TJ? - Hm? - Can you come with me? Please? Yeah. Just let me go change. Hannah, where are we going? Come on, TJ. Just follow me. Okay, I'm coming. What the... TJ, come. What? It was here. It was all here. - Okay, what was here? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Come on, come on, come on. - Hannah. No. Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but there were guns and other things in this box. Guns? Like hunting guns? No, I don't think so. Are you sure you weren't imagining it? TJ, I find a metal box in a tunnel, in the middle of fricking nowhere, and you think I'm crazy? I didn't say you were crazy. What's that? It's just trash, Hannah. Patrick. Where's Jack? He's inside. Why? You need to come with us. Now. We'll explain in a second. But we need to ask Jack something, now. Jack, I'm only gonna ask this once, so turn up your hearing aids. What in blazes is this all about? Where do you keep your guns? What? What kind of guns do you have? What's this all about? Answer the question, Jack. My 12-gauge and 9 mill. Any machine guns? No. Would someone please tell me what the hell is going on? Show him. Where did you find this? In the old culvert, in a metal box with your name on it. Is it yours? No. Any idea why it was stashed on your property, then? No. That's Raymond's room. I know who's room it is and I don't give a shit! What are you doing? Damn it! Jack. What is this stuff? Looks like electrical schematics. Substation maps. So it was him. He did this? Someone's here. Raymond. Shit. Come on, man. Grab your shit and let's go! We ain't got all day. I think we've got a problem. Is he gone? Shit. They're sealing us in. Hey! What are you doing?! Raymond, you're an asshole! Let us out! Raymond! Let us out of here! It's no use. It's a solid wood door. We're trapped. This was a mistake. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. We'll find a way out. What is that? I'm at home, I'm in my bed, and this is all just a dream. Shut up. Sounds like water. Water? Gas. What? It's no use. We're gonna die. I'm sorry, guys. This is all my fault. There's gotta be another way outta here. Jack? Jack? Grandpa! Jack. We gotta get outta here. Is there another way? Jack, please. What? The map? No. No, no, no, we need another way out. No, it's not the map. We can do this, but you gotta help us. Grandpa, we have to get out. I need you to get up. Hannah, go. Okay, quick, quick! You've gotta get out! Let's go! Come on! TJ, you're kidding? We have to go. Go! You gotta stop him. I don't give a shit about Raymond. You don't understand. He's your father. You lied to me. And I trusted you. I never meant to mislead you. After Amy died, Raymond started drinking hard. He'd gotten into some trouble with the law and I thought, one day, he'd change, get sober. Maybe I was being naive, but I thought, of all the people, you'd be the one to bring him around. I can't, Jack. Your whole life, you wanted to know where you come from. And now, you know. I wasn't trying to keep anything from you. I just wasn't ready. It wasn't your decision to make. This wasn't what I wanted. But now, you know, and he's out there. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. There comes a time in all our lives when we have to make tough choices. Do we sit back and watch the world go to hell? Or do we stand up and fight for the good that's left in it? Today is that day. You have to try. I can't do it alone. You're not alone. We're here, with you. All the way. There's just one problem. Try it now. Damn it! What am I missing? This piece of shit is never gonna get us outta here. Hannah. Come on, have some faith. Did you check the distributor? - Twice. - Battery? Plenty of power. It just won't start. Are you sure you're not outta gas? Hannah, seriously? Not helpful. Uh, TJ? What? You ever heard of gas? Why? 'Cause there's none in this car. From what I can figure, this is where he's going. What's Foley Mountain? Gotta be a substation. He's trying to take down the grid. Yeah. Parts of it, anyway. So what do we do to stop him? It's less than a hundred miles from here. If we can intercept them before they get there, we might have a chance. Okay, let's go. You gonna make it, old man? I ain't dead yet. This is crazy. You know that, right? These logging roads run clear across these parts like a web. But no one knows them like I do. Give me that. What are you doing? Trying to send out a text. Got a signal? No. Are we getting close? We're just outside of New Castle. It's not far now. Are you sure? Getting dark out. I worked for the power company for 25 years. Trust me. We didn't have any GPS back then, we still found our way. Yeah, you navigate by the stars too? It's a piece of paper. It's called a map. What do you got? Uh, it's called Google. Yeah? How's that working for you? Faster! Faster! Are you guys okay? Jack? I'm still here. I can get us out of this. There's no time for that. Come here. I believe in you. I always have. What will you choose? What are you waiting on? Go after her, you fool. Hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Let's think this through, okay? Say we get inside, then what? Well, I'm not letting him do this, so I'm gonna go over this fence with or without you. Okay. Okay, no, no. I'm here. I'm with you. But what is the plan, exactly? They're using blasting caps. C4 is basically Play-Doh without it. Blasting caps? You know what you're doing? No, not really. Confidence, love it. Wait. Look. All we have to do is cut the caps off once they place the charges on. It's simple. Simple. Yeah. You got that thing set yet? I got three more of them. What does it look like I'm doing? I'm almost done. You changed the frequency on the remote, right? Not yet.

Turn around. Girl, you are persistent. Must be genetic. So the old man told you, did he? Well, it doesn't change anything. I'm not finished yet. Whatever you think this is, it's over. You don't get it. This was the last one. Once this station is down, this once great, powerful country will be on its knees. Nothing will stop them. Them? Who's them? They're everywhere, watching our every move, just waiting for the right moment to strike. You're insane. Maybe. But I think that runs in our family too. I am not you. I will never be you.

They promised a future and a shit ton of money. You're better than that. You're better than them. You can make a choice. And you can help us end this. You don't know what they've done, what they will do if we fail. I'm as good as dead. I've made my choice. This is the way it has to be. Dad, please. Please do not. Mom is dead, I'm still here, though. Please don't abandon me again. Please, I can get you help. I'm afraid it's too late for that. No. Goodbye, TJ. Dad. Dad, no! Please! Dad! Please! Dad, no!
