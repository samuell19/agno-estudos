Maya, why are you ignoring me? Maya, I come behind you every day. I love you, Maya. I keep talking, but, you are ignoring me. I'm talking to you only. I love you so much. Maya, I'm asking you. Reply me. Whatever you said now, say it tomorrow too. Then I'll tell my decision. Okay, I'll wait for you here and the same time. Bye. Hey, who's that? Who? Hey, who are you? Hey. Who's that? 'If you dote this virgin, you're destined to die.' 'Money for Guts 2' (A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa) Meenakshi... Swamy, did you see my daughter? No, Swamy. Where has she gone? Kumar swamy, did you see my daughter? What happened? I went to get the offering of god. Wonder, where she left meanwhile! Swamy, you search that way. - Okay, brother. - I'll search this way. - Tell me, if you see her. - Yes, swamy. Meenakshi... Meenakshi... Lord Ayyappa! Please, give back my child safely. Dad! Where did you go, dear? I was in search of you, dad. Dad! God saved me! Which god, dear? There... (A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa) Swamy... Swamy, you've saved my child. Thank you very much... Swamy! Dad, I need biscuit. Come, I'll get you. Where did he go? Dear, you shouldn't go anywhere leaving dad. Leave the way, Swamy. (A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa) Swamy... If you're here, then the one who saved my child...? Is he the lord, then? Praise Lord Ayyappa! Swamy. Just now I spoke to you and came by rear door. You create tales in between that. You lost the child when gone to have donated food... ...and you expect god to save your child? Already, problems are mounted on god to toss out. You must take care of your child. Go... You make a series in between. Praise Lord Ayyappa! Uncle, upon hearing your high voice, the lord might go to Andhra pradesh. Pray calmly. Maa... Ayyappa... Lord... Swamy! swamy! Be careful. - What happened? - Nothing. Come, step slowly. A well mannered guy in this generation! Swamy... - Hey, look at his head. - Swamy, be quiet. When the priest blessed him with sacred grains... ...it didn't stay on his head. - Be quiet. Swamy... A man can live with bald head, But shouldn't lead a bare life. You're yet to come up in life. Don't get his curse. Give respect to elders. Praise Lord Ayyappa! Praise the Lord! I'm watching everything from the moment I came. Wonder, how devotional, submissive and respectful, Vijay is! Is Vijay married? No. Why are you asking? My daughter works in a software firm. I'm looking for a marriage proposal. I think of getting her married to Vijay. - Swamy, get up. - What happened? Swamy get up. Did I say anything wrong, for him to faint? Swamy, get up. What did you say? You've seen Vijay only in devotional stance. But, you didn't see his contradictory. (Song from 'Vedhalam') You dog! He has started again. Shit! Dog. Hey, how dare you bark at me, who saved you once? You've become so pompous. Okay, Come. Let's see who wins. (Song from 'Vedhalam') Oh no, how to sleep? Oh no! (Song from 'Vedhalam') Crazy, to whom are you competing? Take it, Swamy. Does he behave so? For me? Take it. He doesn't look like that. Can't you see the people around you? Leave the dhoti down. Can't you behave decently in public? Ask Guruji, what he needs? Excuse me, don't throw the cups here. - Swachh bharat...Clean India. - Okay, swamy. If you do these, you'll be named as 'Anti-Indians'. I can't believe you when he has such a decent uncle. You mean, decent? Hey, goof. Uncle... Dude. - Uncle... - Dude. Shit! What an indecent act of you, when everyone is sleeping? My wife doesn't want to keep my attires in this wardrobe. It was the dowry from her parents. So, going to bang with it on her mom's head. Egghead, you're an affectionate person! Above that, you're a sensible person! Vijay, what nonsense is going on? Your nuisance is waking up the entire colony. Drunken morons. Shit. Mr.Doctor, This is our own problem. Better, don't poke your nose. Else, I'll yell at you in cuss words. If you don't understand, shut your trap. Who asked you to see all these? You...get in. Uncle, a man shouldn't cry. - Master... - A man shouldn't cry. - Master... - Uncle, don't cry... - Master... - I'm coming. He has started again. Ask him. - I'll take care, wait. - Master. - Vijay will listen to me. - Master... - He has more respect on me. - Master... - Uncle. - He blabs. It's not good, taking booze and creating ruckus every night. What's your problem, tell me? I'll sort it out. On Saturdays, when taking head bath... ...if I try to take the soap, it falls into the closet. Will you come to take that with your hands? Dear, he's asking you to take it. Get inside. Ladies are around. Behave decently. You go inside, I'll come. Here it is. Get inside. It has become a routine for you. Come, let's complaint to the president. It has become a routine for them daily. - It's menacing. - What's happening here? Why are you drunk and creating ruckus here? If I get angry, then I won't leave you. Whose brief is this? - Do you've Aadhar card? - Why now? Now, Aadhar card is must, if you go dead to the graveyard. - Wait I'll call the police. - You've crossed the expiry date. Go away. Get the aadhar card, can't keep your body for more than a day. What's this, dear? Give respect to elders. - Do you want respect? - Oh no, my legs. Do you want respect? - Do you want respect? - Viji... Viji...what's this? Non-veg, I ate chicken. Viji, see who has come? Who is that mushroom head? He is the President... Isn't Ramnath Kovind, the President? Is he the President now? Uncle, it's the president. Left, right...left, right... About turn. - Viji, what's happening here? - Shouldn't we sleep. Did you take the medicine? - No... - Not yet? Take the medicine, Go... No, he hits him not even considering his age. Dude, it's the police. I'm not the police, but a thug. - We can sleep peacefully, here after. - You made a call to the police. Are you a thug! go... Is it true? (A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa) It's irrelevant to what I witness and to your narration. Swamy, still you don't believe us? Come to watch the fun, now. You'll know, then. (A devotional song on Lord Ayyappa) Praise the lord. Look here, after taking the Mudra mala, You mustn't take booze for three days. How dare you say that, monkey faced? When everyone is taking booze on the way itself, Why're you framing new rules? - How dare you call guruji as monkey? - Is he Aravind swamy, the actor? Look at his face, he looks like a monkey. Hey, you must be... Sorry to everyone... I shouldn't talk so, to guruji. Sorry. Swamy, drinking is one's personal choice. Why are you...? Guruji, I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk filthy. - It's my fault. - Sorry, swamy. How did they step into devotion, when they behave audacious? They didn't. Someone must have, when they were sleeping. But, they aren't aware that we did. Praise Lord Ayyappa! Praise lord... Viji, you're wearing the mudra mala. Uncle, you too wear the same. Hey, who did this when we were sleeping? Do you think, we'll be scared if you put the mudra mala? Dude, remove that. Viji... Without a valid reason, you mustn't take off the mala. Dude, my body won't withstand. It's related to god. Any rules and regulations to take it off? It's possible, only if someone dies. Dude! Oh no... God... Save me. - Hold him. - What happened? Uncle, Is he dead? No. Just missed. Shit. What's going on between you and Viji? That's nothing. Known that, if anyone dies... ...we can take off this mala. So we tried, but missed. Whom to try next...? Praise Lord Ayyappa! It's okay. What will you do, after he takes off the mala as soon as you reach? God has to take care of everything. Maya. Sir. One minute. Okay, sir. I'll be back. Sir. Why weren't you seen yesterday? Sir, I asked permission for two days. You mean, two days? It's been four days. Sir, I went to Kerala. Is the Kerala government paying your salary? - Sorry, sir. - Then? Sorry sir, I didn't get the ticket. Is the ticket you mean for Mohanlal's movie? Why are you laughing? I'm very upset with you. Sir, what I must do now? That's good. Today, you're joining me for lunch. I need to do some important discussions with you. Right? - Okay, sir. - Don't delay. Yes baby! I completed my medical studies so easily. But, it seems very difficult to propose Maya. Somehow, I must convey her, today. I shall do it, Karthik. Yes, you can. Maya, 'I love you'. Shit. 'I love you'. It's alright. Maya, 'I really love you'. Shit. Once again. Maya, 'I love you' Doctor, Maya has left as she got an urgent call. She told me to inform you. What? It somehow goes missing. Praise Lord Ayyappa! Thank god. Ayyappa! Wine shop? You dare to put Mala while sleeping? How could all of you sleep today? What is he doing? Is he going for a long journey? Oh no, he is watching. - What's that? - Don't know, mom Oh God! Ganesh Chaturthi pooja has been arranged in our colony. You must come for sure. Very happy. I'll definitely come. - And make the festival grandeur. - You must come. Keep it inside. Hey Kiruba, donate the bazaar's one day collection to the festival. Thank you very much, sir. Very happy. Take leave. Greetings, boss. - Palani, are you fine? - I'm fine. Boss, why did you donate money for that zone? Why shouldn't we give? We can't paste a poster or fix a banner there. Is it butter milk outside and booze inside? If you do anything in my street, again... No Viji, if my boss is aware of this... Go and tell your boss. If he does all these in Viji's place, The line drawn on the banner will be on his face. Who's that? It seems that Chockalingam, a big shot was there in our party. - He is his grandson. - Is it? His grandfather died for the sake of the party. But, when his mother died in an accident... ...no one helped him from the locale and from our party. He behaves odd, from that day onwards. Is he creating ruckus to that extent? Okay, we'll handle him next time. Hey, take the pieces first. Don't give plain biryani. Take that biryani. Has anything fallen into the biryani? You're searching in the tub, when I sound like a cat. Are you mixing the meat of cat? Bhai shop biryani is for, 'Quality, faith and honesty'. Is he Hansika, the actress? Hey, get lost. Go and get the bag of onions. Come, Vijay. - Have you brought the load? - Yes, boss. Take it. I'll call you in the evening for load. Parcel a pack of biryani with leg piece. - Dear. - Tell me, You borrow from the neighbour, the side dish of your food. But, buying biryani now. Have you got money for free? I'm coming here for ten years. Your house is nearby, why do you take so long years to come? I mean, I'm regularly coming here. - What's that in the hand? - Shirt. Is it? You got two. If you buy one, get another for free. I'm getting a shirt free without buying anything. How, dear? Like this, dear. Dear, what you do is not good. Yes, I'll take this. Dear, give. Though you're a regular customer, give me the money. - It's routine for you and Viji. - Give me the money. - Leave me. - Either give the parcel or money. Maya. I wish to talk to you in person. Tell me, sir. Don't call me 'sir'. Call me, Karthik Tell me, Karthik. That sounds sweet! Maya. I love you Listen to me, Karthik. go away from here. No. Go away, Karthik. I love you Where has she gone? Hey, open the door. Hey, open... Hey, look here... Sir, what happened? 'If you dote this virgin, you're destined to die.' What, dear? Are you all fine? (A devotinal song on Lord Ganesh.) (A devotinal song on Lord Ganesh.) Pour it, dude. Uncle, is this okay? Dude, it's of little difference. Measure it right. See now. Oh,no. Again it's a mistake. Pour in that. - Now? - Pour it, dude. What? I was checking the measurements, dear. Are you mindless? If he has mind, wouldn't he hit a better chick? - Hey, come here. - Yes, coming. Why do you behave like this at this age? It's same only. Take it. Look now. Cheers. (A devotional song on Lord Ganesh) I thank the few people who applauded. Another name of Lord Pillaiyar is 'Ganesh'. Our brother has donated for this concert. If there exists any problem, in this Chockalingam colony. Our boss will stand for us. Why are you doing like that? This colony is named after your grandfather. Instead of giving you the due respect... ...they show respect to him. Why are you provoking me? I want you to rise in life. -he'll teach you not to spend lavishly. -even the colour of currency will change, but not his attitude to donate. -the hands which has turned red by donating... We thank him with love and affection. Shit, if I listen to him speaking like this, I get enraged. He doesn't get tired to donate. We praise his glorious soul. A beautiful song, dedicated to him. "He gave everything." "For whom did he give?" "Did he give for only one person?" "No he gave for all..." "He gave everything." What did he give? "For whom did he give?" To whom did he give? "Did he give for just one person?" "No he gave for all..." He gave shit. When the boss is here, he is doing like this. Mic Maran, 'His greatness!' 'Revolutionary leader!' 'People's star!' He has donated for all. It's appreciable if you sing a song in praise of him. That's okay. Whom did he give? He gave to his illicit wife. Keep silence. Hey... Go and graze the cows that way. Then, what you said? So, his hands turned red on donating? Was he giving sindoor in the temple? Hey uncle, don't laugh. He is fuming. Look at him. He is leaving, uncle. Hey, I'm watching you. You're crossing your limits. Kiruba. Wait. It's normal at festivals to indulge in fuss with the influence of booze. We shouldn't bother all those. Did you understand? Come, let's go. Sir... No, I'm not angry. I'm leaving. You continue with the concert. I'll leave. Laugh... Laugh well... Bye. Ask him, what he want? - Viji, it's not good. - You too don't look good. Isn't your wife living with you? I'll hit on your head with the mic. Go and sit. - Hey, egghead. - Give mic to me - Take it - Go away... We are sorry for the interruption. The musical programme continues with the voice of Maran... Go ahead, Maran. - Viji... - Come, uncle. Will you please tell me, about whom I must sing now? About whom? - Sing about my uncle. - Dude, I'm feeling shy. Uncle, don't feel shy. About him? Sing about his attire... I'm feeling shy. Sing about his physique. Sing about his loony attitude. Instead of singing about him, I'll sing about you. Okay. Then, sing about me... Dude... Uncle, what? Ready, start. "Crazy, to whom are you competing?" "Crazy, to whom are you competing?" "Hey bash, If I let go, it booms." "Start off, slap off, Get rid at once..." "Either you hanker or you don't hanker," "I told you to shut your trap." "Curb your hostile feeling, you'll get slapped." "If our buddy comes, the locale is like a fine flour." "If he is not there, the locale is like sour batter." "If I barge in, your face will be torn and sheared." "If I hit you, your head goes staggered." "Come on...come on... Breach up..." "Come on...come on... Breach up..." "We are tip-cars, You don't be silly." "You aroused the lion..." "Crazy, to whom are you competing?" Hey come on, boys "Crazy, to whom...?" "Crazy, to whom...?" "Hey, a monkey was caught by a goof, in a tree." "The oldster's attire was grabbed who went to catch the monkey." "Check in the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter..." "...the likes and shares goes countless,when posting the snaps" "The loss and labour are like dust to our brother," "Our boss, highly the mass in the locale," "Our boss, highly the mass in the locale," "Don't let down the goal, you won't thrust," "Always enjoy your life, you'll triumph in all sorts." "Hey, food at home... Booze on road..." "Be with me... Ever to enjoy..." "We are tip-cars, You don't be silly." "You aroused the lion..." "Crazy, to whom...?" "Crazy, to whom...?" Sure sir. I'll do it. Definitely. On the way sir. Hey, Good morning, sir. - Hey, - Good morning, sir. I greeted you. Hey, who need your greetings? I can't lift my hand. Get me the medicine. I must go to office urgently. Can't you sweep late today? I'm the team leader. You mean, without doing any work, always finding faults on people... ...who work under you, isn't it? What is this, like a percussion player? Go. Get me the medicine. My hands are paining. Hey, come here. Where do you take me? Viji is not well, can you get him medicine? He has joined me. Viji, don't mistake me. I must go to job, urgently. Hey, everyone says the same right from the morning. Everyone in this world will say that they go... ...for jobs in the morning. You've got up early today because of the pain in hand. That's why, this confusion. Hey, Come here. Are you calling me? Can't you know, that's you? Come. Come, doctor. What's the problem, Viji? Yesterday, as I banged them, I can't lift the hand. Do you have medicines for that. I'll check. Are you going to shave my underarms? Viji, I'm a doctor. Okay. I'll see. Tell me, whether it's painful? - Is it paining? - Yes. Is it paining? Sir, do you need an auto? Is it like calling an auto, when I'm getting slapped? Get lost. Come. Wonder, all the doctors are the same. You keep asking whether it's painful? Do something. I'll message you an ointment. Apply that. Buy it for me. You're teasing more. Hey, egghead. Karthik. Why are you looking somber? Are you okay? Don't call me, 'Karthik'. You can call me as 'sir'. Okay, sir. That sounds good. What happened, sir? Nothing. Hey, Maya. Sister. - Sister, when did you come here? - Just now. - Is everyone fine at home? - Yeah. - Sister, you don't have any problem, right? - No, I'm okay. It's been long time since we met. - Do you know that girl, Maya? - Yes, I know. We belong to the same place, Chottanikkara. 'If you dote this virgin, you're destined to die.' I wonder, what medicine he gave. The pain is aggravating. Hey, alien faced... Why are you acting like a monkey? It's an exercise, dude. You're teasing me as I can't lift my hand. Call the doctor. Do you have a pricking sense in heart? I feel so, when you're asking. Do you feel like an elephant banging you? No, I feel like it blessed me after getting five bucks. Why are you asking all these? All these are the symptoms of heart attack Do you think of yourself as a cardiac surgeon? Dude... I can't even hit him. Excuse me. Who is she? - Who is Viji here? - I'm Viji. Who are you? Dr.Karthik has sent me. Where is he? Hello sir, don't strain yourself. The pain will be more. Just relax. I've come to treat you by physiotherapy. Uncle, she wants to give something. Get that and send her. Go. Drop in this. Sir, physio is a treatment. I'm here to give treatment for his pain in hand. Are you drunk? Don't lie. I have to give treatment. He told me that I'll get rid of the pain, if I take booze. How will you sleep? I will sleep freely. You said that I shouldn't lie to doctor. Not that, I asked about the position of your hand when sleeping. He doesn't know where he sleeps when drunk? You're asking him how he sleeps? You go ahead. It's good. It's not good. Shut up. Remove your shirt. Dude, shall I stay out? Give that. Can't you be quiet? Can I get hot water? Hot water... Is kitchen available here? - I'll get on my own. - There... - No, just a minute. - Don't worry. - Don't go there...I'm telling... - It's very clumsy. - Tell her. - It's a bachelor's house. - Who is she? - Don't know. Where is the match box? Is there a match box? It's near my mom's photo. Dude Dude, it's an old type of love, falling at first sight. How to fall in love without seeing, you goof. Sorry, uncle. I blab because of pain. It's okay, dude. Come to the hospital, at a stretch of three days. Okay? Sharply at 8 a.m. Okay, bye. Dude, I know your feelings. You're an auto driver. She is a doctor. It won't work out. I'll try my best with other acts. Shut your trap. - The water has become cold. - Is it? Are you saying, it won't work out? Oldster, who'll it be? I'm also seeing like you only. Will she be his relative? He doesn't have any other relatives apart from his uncle. Are you wondering at the girl who has come to Viji's house? - Who is that girl? - I sent her. Are you running out of income? Nonsense. I have a plan. You people will not understand. How many days Viji tortured us? He is going to suffer for everything. How? If we en masse and make him to love her, that's enough... ...his chapter will be closed. - That means? - Super. It's over. Do you know who her father is? Is he a big hooligan? No. A politician? More than that. 'Chottanikkara Mukkanni graveyard' Swamy, my problem is with my daughter. She loves a guy who is not right for our family status. But, she... Do you have that guy's attire and the sand he stepped into? Now, the chief priest is going into trance. Now, the bad and the soul of the dead will come back. No one should be afraid or get scared. Guruji, will come back from trance in ten minutes. Now, by the power of my pooja, See what happens to the guy who loves your daughter. Chanda... Witchy oldster, What, dude? Get up, we have to go. The wine shop opens only at 12 o'clock. Are we going to get it illegally? I'll hit you. She told us to come at 8 a.m for physiotherapy. What? Come, let's go. I'll brush and come. Anyway, it'll stink after smoking. - Come. - Dude, I haven't wear the shirt. Dr. Karthik, orthopedician. Sir, register the name at reception and wait. Is any out patient here? You? OP? Tell me, are you OP? She is asking whether we are out patient? Not him. It's me. I was asked to come for physio, - Referred by Ortho doctor. - Viji. Dr. Karthik... Hey Viji, I made you to wait for long time. It's okay, doctor. I'm very sorry. Preethi, they are my neighbours. Let them wait in my physiotherapy room. - Viji, I'll be back. - Okay. - Come. - Yes. When you got injured in head at a brawl, You took it easy. But, just for a sprain you've come to hospital, now. I didn't come, uncle. She made me to come. She was looking deep into my eyes. Did you notice that? See now, though there are many patients... ...she'll come as a sweet laddoo to meet me. As you said, a laddoo has come. But, it's Tirupati laddoo... Who is the patient here? - He is. - Hey, what? - Don't lie that it's not paining. - He is lying. It's not me. It's paining. - Maya. - Sir. I asked you to treat Viji. What are you doing here? Sir, Dr.Geetha has said she'll take care of him. That's why, I'm looking at the report of this patient. It's not important for me. Go and attend Viji. Okay, sir. Maya, just a minute. Advice Viji not to take drinks, when giving treatment. Sir, that's normally advised to all patients. Absolutely. But Viji is not normal, You must say him with utmost care. Because, he is my neighbour. Okay, sir. You got me caught, right? Geetha, Doctor calls you. I'll attend him. I told you, right. Hey Viji, how are you? Are you feeling better than yesterday? You came for this moment. Look at her. After getting up in the morning, if you do this exercise... ...ten times for two days, it'll be quite normal. Come, let's go. Then, you shouldn't take alcohol till the treatment gets over. What? Shouldn't take drinks? Why does he gets tense, if I tell you not to take drinks? He'll get free booze from me. Dude. I'm telling for your goodness. Are you aware of the side effects of taking alcohol? Failure of liver, pancreas, increase of sugar and... ...cholesterol levels, and even heart attack. Maya, are you advising him a lot, just for a sprain? Are you so caring on Viji? It's alright. Viji, don't be careless neglecting the treatment. Because, bones are important in the anatomy of human body. Doctor, do you know which is the weakest bone in our body? Asking me? He is a funny fellow. He is questioning an Ortho doctor. It's lacrimal. No doctor. Show your hand. Don't you feel like electrocuted? This bone, doctor. Okay, I'm leaving, doctor. - Bye. - Bye. - Come, you're going to get knocked. - Bye. Bro, don't hit at that sister's house. Viji, are you playing cricket? Hit well. I asked you to hit the ball, but you hit my butt. See now, how I'm going to tease Viji? Viji, we want six. We want six. We want six. Throw the ball. We want six. Oh God! He thinks of him as Arya, always accompanied by women. Master, what are you searching for? Throw the ball. I'm searching for that. Here it is. Catch. He hit very hardly. It's paining. Dude, it's enough of playing cricket. Come, let's have booze and play. I was advised not to drink till the treatment ends. I don't want, uncle. Oh, as that girl advised, you stopped drinking. How many times our locales would've asked you to stop drinking... ...did you ever listen to them? The locales told me for their goodness... But she told me for my goodness! Come, let's have booze. - Come here. - Brother...? - You carry on... - Come, let's drink. Uncle, when I'm not interested, why are you spoiling me? Am I spoiling you? Tell me, am I spoiling you? In whatever modulation you speak, it's you spoiling me. Are you defying your uncle? - In the death bed of your mom, - You weren't here. When your father died, You were in inebriated condition. You speak, whatever you want. I can riposte for all. Will he drink? Take it, dude. I was thinking that happiness lies only in intake of alcohol. Yes. But, now I feel happy, if I think of her. Then, why I must take this? Dude... "Knitty-knotty thug driven into willy-nilly." "The guy who went on a spree tip-toed and got hedged." "Got hedged." "Got hedged." "Till now, I wasn't so..." "I never spoke alone, I never smiled alone." "She created arson in my heart, oh...oh..." "She played a game of love with her beauty," "Let the silence speak out... Speak out..." "Hey beauteous lass... beauteous lass..." "Hey I shuffled like a kite...oh..." "I was totally shattered when you looked at me, oh..." - Hey catch... - Who's that, thief? Shit! Is it love? "In the down pours, under an umbrella," "We both will go alone..." "In the storm, like a tree, I fell to your beauty..." "Twining the fingers and when looking at your face," "The shyness ingests you." "Like you, my heart beats for a young one." "With a ploy, oh...oh..." "She made him to fall." "With a ploy, oh...oh... She lifted him." "I forgot myself when you see me, dear." "I shuffled like a kite...oh..." "I was totally shattered when you looked at me...oh..." "I shuffled like a kite...oh..." "I was totally shattered when you looked at me...oh..." Tell me, Viji. You wanted to say something. Tell me, what's that? The food I buy goes waste. Why? I feel the food like a poison. I can't eat. See, how skinny I've become. I was thinking, only the intake of alcohol gives me happiness. You made me to realise, that happiness is different. If you stay with me, throughout my life. I'll be very happy. I'll take care of you too. I can understand. I'm a reckless fellow. You think, how to trust me? The speed breaker will set right... That is...everything will be set right after marriage. I'm blabbering in anxiety. - That's why... - That's why? It'll be good if you tell your decision today itself. I can understand, Viji. I'm going to my native, tomorrow. After I'm back, tell me the same thing again. Then I'll respond. Hello, I can't bear till then. Finalise it now itself. You tell me the same again. Then I'll respond. You want me to say again? I'm telling you now itself. I'm telling you at this moment. 'I love you' First, you leave from here, Viji. Reply me. I love you. Go home carefully, Viji. - Hello... - First leave. I'll rove around like a ghost, until you accept my love. Listen to me. Go. I love you Don't get into problems voluntarily. Why? Are you going to get me an offer? You might kiss me on the lips, if I permit. Stay back. Don't stand here. Go away. Don't stand here. - Why are you chasing me away? - Go away. Have you asked any girl to come here? First, you leave from here. Go away from here. I'm telling for your goodness. Go away. Do you know what happened to Viji? His phone is not reachable. So, our plan has worked out. Isn't it? Yes. I was waiting for this good news to sleep well. He shouldn't raise up, after hit by her, proposing his love. I'm expecting that to happen. Doctor, the auto has come. God bless you my child. You said he'll be collapsed, but he comes fresh.

Master has good talent. You blinked your eye in a moment, isn't it? Run away... Will you go without getting caught? Why do you all await for my love proposal! - Is it a setting? - That is... No...leave that, Viji. In the same romantic mood, if you go to bed soon, you'll get that... What's that? Love...Pyaar...Romance, Viji. Enough of shaking your stomach. You didn't do anything funny? He'll die when he enters his house and gets hit by the ghost. 'If you dote this virgin, you're destined to die.' Don't worry about anything, Viji. Visit the mosque on Friday. Everything will be fine. Your uncle is telling something. What happened, Viji? You've told everyone. Have you come to ask again? Not that, we can't believe. Hey, you want the ghost to hit him again... ...just for the sake of your belief. We found the reason for this. Yes, Viji. Maya! With whom you're in love. It's her father. Yes, only he do this black magic and witch craft. Our Viji will thrash even fifty henchmen. He has sent a ghost. Is he pompous though a magical plaintiff? He is also a human. Anyhow, his daughter will be married to someone. Why that shouldn't be our beloved Viji? Absolutely. It's easy to manage, if her father dwells here. What can we do, when he is in Kerala? Guys go from continent to continent for the sake of love. Kerala is a nearby state. We'll accompany you, if you are afraid. Hey, how dare you ask him whether he is afraid? He thrashed his senior in school days. He has seen many hooligans. Let's leave, dude. We aren't afraid of anyone. We have made others to be afraid of us. Don't think Come Uncle, why have we come here? inquire them? I've asked for chicken and egg. It'll come now. If I slap you, your ears will rove. How? It'll rove. Now, did you understand what to ask for? I'll ask. Wait. Hi all, There is a strap thief, a bear king here... Where is his house? What happened, uncle? Everyone is shocked as if they're trapped in actress Sri Reddy's leaks? Yes, dude. Hey, where is the magician's house? Are you new to this place? Which place? Tell... Hey, How'll he tell if you close his mouth? Yes, we are new to this place. Do you know that Bhattadhri's house? You aren't aware of that Garudaraja Bhattadhri! He is an expert in blackmagic and witchcraft. What did he have as side dish? Lentil snack or dry fish pickle. Dude, don't talk to him. He might ask egg for credit. The great black magician, Garudaraja Bhattadhri... Take your hands off. No one will drink. Tell. Everyone is afraid of him. No one can sleep in peace, if you oppose him. Why, will he snore lying beside us? Stop praising him. Give us his address. Mukkanni graveyard. Now the great magician, great friend of evil souls is going into trance. Soul of the dead-demon-devil... Uncle, I've seen people feeding dogs. But, here they feed the ghost. Dude, it's beetroot rice. I don't need side dish. You eat. If the evil spirits create any trouble here? Oh no! It stinks. It might be the food mixed with blood. Take this and rinse your mouth. You all should not get panicked or become afraid. Who are you being drunk and creating troubles here? My guru is 'Lord of the Lords'! Will you witness...? What are you blabbering? Did you see the lord? Hey sister, Even the kids won't get afraid of this. Don't do these gimmicks to me. Hey... - Everyone stay calm. - If you touch my dude, I'll lynch you. Sister, I know he is a big shot. It's the problem between me and my father-in-law. It's the family issue. No one must interfere. Understood? Sister, If anyone interferes, They'll be thrashed. Uncle. Uncle, relax. Uncle, relax. See here for a minute. Uncle, Sorry. This should be discussed by the elders. You come and talk. Not that, dude. I'm feeling hungry. Give me that egg. Egg...Here it is. - Take it. - Thanks. If we love the daughter of a cop, they cuff us with police. If we love a politician's daughter, they pound with henchmen. If we love a black magician's daughter, you whip with ghost. How the world will survive without love? What's this? I don't understand. Tell me. Dude. - What happened, uncle? - Stomach upset. It might because of the black magic egg you had. I brought you here to talk with him, thinking you're an elder. Go... Hurry up. Come fast. If he accepts for engagement, as an elder, you need to be here. - Go and hurry up. - Don't get angry. I'll hurry up. Uncle, I'll tell you an information. - Your daughter... - Dude. What's your problem? What about the water? Here it is, take that. Dude, I can't use this with one hand. - Take this. - Okay dude. - Leave that. - That is guru's dome water. - I need water urgently. - It's very important. - Without water, how can I wash? - Don't take that. This is some sacred water. Get the leftover for him. That's not what I asked for. - Oh, my goddess, it's dome water. - Leave me. - Something is going to happen. - Relax, it'll come. - Uncle, get the leftover water. - Okay, dude. Uncle, you must understand one thing. Is your daughter so beauteous to whip me with ghost? Nothing like that. But, she'll do one thing. Uncle, she is an affectionate girl. I fell for her. Your daughter's forehead glows like a blue label bottle. Her eyes turns red. Her lips turns pale when touched. Very chubby. She is cute, uncle. I'm an orphan. If you accept me to marry your daughter... ...I'll take care of her in my heart. Uncle, open your eyes and look at me Mic testing... Uncle... Uncle... Uncle... Please, uncle. I won't go from here, uncle. Uncle... Uncle... Why have you dressed badly, when ladies are around you? Dude, why are you lying on his lap as a feeding baby? Uncle...have you come back? Have you spoke to him? Didn't he open his eyes, still? No, uncle. He is sitting like Lord Kubera's doll. Hey, toad... Go away. How long, uncle? He doesn't open either his mouth or his eyes. Leave it, I'll take care. In-law, behave like an elder. In-law, we have come down to meet you. You've done and only talking. Keep quiet, dude, Enough of making fun. In-law, tell us either you like the groom or not. Uncle, he can't say that he doesn't like. He ought to say that he likes me. Though you whip me with a ghost, I came to meet you, that's because of my love on your daughter. So, stop all these and think of a good name to your grandson. Shall I leave? Chanda... Uncle... Weapon. Dude. Dude, weapon. Come on... Stop! Can I ask you a question? Why did you push that Panicker's workers? That is... The magical plaintiff's daughter, And my son-in-law are in love. That's why we came here. Hey, will it be Malayalam, if you use that slang for tamil? It's enough for me suffering in your amity. Just shut your trap. Brother, it's a love matter. Oh, is it love? Yes. See. No one from this place will help you to go against the black magician. But, there is one. Brother, who is that? Kunjukuttan. Kunjukuttan. Where is he? You mean, where? He is here. I'm that Kunjukuttan. What's the rationale to help us? There is a reason. Do you know what happened between us? This is what happened. Mr. Kunju... Don't waste the time asking what happened?

Are you combing? Why do you make fun of me? As the scalp is itchy, I'm scratching. Kunju, what's the feud between you and the magical plaintiff? - Feud? - Yes. This is what happened. I'll never ask about your flashback. I swear on you. Why did you come here? I came to buy banana chips as it's of low cost. Okay, I only told you to propose me again. For that? Will you come to my place? Viji. I'm feared, my dad might do something. Go away from here, Viji. Please. Tell that you don't like me and not in love. I'll leave now. Tell me. I don't like you. Are you telling me to leave or not? I don't know. Are you confused? This girl from Kerala has fallen in love. Switch off the song. You play a song as soon as the love onset. Think of what to do next. Brother, there is a balm for headache. - A good for a bad. - Okay. Similarly, there must be someone to oppose him. Yes, only one person. Hey, won't you tell when you put the brake? Chakra Mahadevi! (Devotional song) Tap on. (Song from 'Velipadinte Pusthakam') Hey, uncle. What's that you do, as if she performs a street dance? I thought it's 'Jimikki kammal' song. Song? Hey, what do you say? Hey egghead, is she dancing for 'Jimkki kammal'? Do you know, who is she? Parasakthi! What's the matter? She is my cousin, who got many proposals. Nothing worked out. You must give us a solution. Devi! Touch this coconut and pray for your heart's desires. You got a flower Within forty one days, your desire will happen. Are you happy? Oh no, what's this? Rudram. It means your time is not good. What to do for remedy? (Blessing) Ma... Ma... - God will bless you. - Ma... Fall at her feet, egghead. Pray... Bless you. What's your problem? I'm Kunju. He is... I know. You have come from Tamil Nadu. Your name starts with 'V'. Your girlfriend name begins with a letter 'M'. Am I right? She is the daughter of Garudaraja Bhattadhri. There is a hindrance in the marriage. Goddess, Lalithambika! Come near. My mother's blessings will be with you. You must attend the Sri chakra Pooja tonight. Okay. (Chanting verse) You can leave. Viji has gone to that Chakra Mahadevi's place. Dude, the hermitage itself is in furore. Did the poet Vairamuthu has said anything? Is there any special pooja today? The plaintiff comes here. So only these arrangements are going on. See, by knowing she is doing favour for us... ...the black magician is coming here to spoil it. What to do? Let him come. A climax awaits him. Hey, come here. Why do they close the doors like it's going to be their first night? Both Mahasakthis will can join A cataclysm will occur here. If you are sneaky, then I'm stealthy. If you are stealthy, then I'm crooked. Hey, it's enough. First, think what to do with that guy. What is happening? He has come to you, in order to toss out me. If I chant mantra and weed out you, He'll go away in fear. Hey, Are you going to finish me by chanting mantra? Just an acting. Can't you do this for sake of my daughter? I'll do for you. How will I be benefited? Will you give me your rubber plantation? What? Rubber plantation? He is thinking too much Will he give it? I'm okay with the deal. Call him, we'll start the drama. Okay. Done. Viji. Come here. Jai jai Chakra Mahadevi. Mangalam Bhavathu. Why sir is grazing the goat inside the hermitage? Don't say that way. No. You don't know. If I say 'I love you', he'll whip me with the ghost. Sir, don't act. If I tell my love now... ...will you whip me with the ghost? Hello darling, Why did you call me, now? My dad may see. He is watching. He has a big face, only half will be visible. See him now. Oh no, dad. Viji, what are you doing? Now, I'm going to propose you before him. Oh no...please don't do that. I love you What? It's not me. Hey, boy. Oh, god. Don't be a bait for my anger. Bhattadhri, you can't harm him ahead of me. Did you witness the power of our Rajamadha? Do whatever you want. Please Viji...don't say. I love you, Maya... Don't get frightened. I'm unable to understand what's happening? 'If you dote this virgin, you're destined to die.' Stop there. Forgive us, Guruji. You made business practicing the 'Malayalam black magic' Betrayals of guru! Get lost. Guru, his only daughter, is in danger. Save us! save us! You have to safeguard, Guruji. Don't punish us and my daughter, Please, safeguard us, Guruji. Okay, Tell me, what's the problem. The priests at present aren't aware of this black magic. Because, my ancestral gurus had said... it learning from the 'Atharvana Veda.' She is 'Yatchi Maya'. Do you know about her? No, guruji. Don't know. At the end of 18th century... ...George Williams, a lust fellow, I Love you The words he used to seduce was, 'I love you' He spoiled the lives of many women by these words. Once, George Williams came to Kerala in a transfer. His lustful thoughts fell on the beauteous Devyani. But he is not aware, that she is the daughter of... ...the 'King of black magic, Marthanda Varma'. He had the administration power and strength... ...so he can't go against Williams. Citing this, he decided to kill by black magic. He took the most dangerous palm script, secured by his ancestors. On a full moon day, Marthanda Varma started... ...the pooja as noted in the palm script. Welcome... Welcome, Yatchi! If anyone comes close to my daughter with love and lust, They must be smashed. He ordered Yatchi and seduced her. and made her to safeguard his daughter. Hi, Devyani I love you. The moment he said that, Yatchi appeared and smashed him. After throwing him out of the country, He stuffed Yatchi in a statue... ...and buried it in a corner of his house. Guruji, a similar Yatchi is in my house. Still it's been active. How did you get this Yatchi in your house? A middleman called me to perform pooja in a old bungalow. Look out for any evil forces. It's here. Some evil force is here. To get rid of that, four plates must be buried in four directions. Luck favoured us. I was happy of finding out a treasure. But, it's a novelty! A nail in that too. The moment you took the nail on the Yatchi... ...the spirit took possession of your daughter. Is all these your work? Swamy, it's problematic only if that is in house. What if thrown away into the sea? Why gururji? Even if you throw into the sea, or burnt in fire, That devil won't leave your daughter on the whole. You must perform a 'Yagna', where it is glorified. For that, a bachelor is needed. He must agree to whatever happens. He is leaving to his place. I said enough. he is not listening. May all auspicious shower on you. Viji, are you afraid? I'm here for you. Get lost You have cheated him asking for money. - Uncle, to her... - Wait, dude. What you think is right. Dharma may be seen losing but finally, dharma triumphs. Look there. Seen him? That evil force, coerced him to ask for forgiveness... ...and marry his daughter to you. No, dude. Don't ever believe that he has renounced. No... Come, let's go. - Wait. - Bag...bag... Wait. He takes his bag often. - Come, let's go. - Viji Come, let's go. - Viji, don't go. - She is speaking. Listen to her. Viji, please. Get your daughter married to an evil force. You've to caress with the skull not with the child. Go away. Come, let's go, dear. - Don't listen to anyone. - Viji, please stay. Listen only what I say, understood? Viji... Dude, no. Love is blind. I... Viji... No! Don't say that! Everything is after the Yagna. You mean, Yagna? Yes, Viji. The Yatchi, is acting against me. To subdue that, the one who marry her... ...must perform a ritual. Yes They're a cheating clan. How come his ghost oppose him? A good question, egghead. Let it be, reply me. - Have you seen the film, Robot? - Yes, I've Didn't the robot created by Rajinikanth, finally oppose him? Hey, oh! That's logic! Yes, it's the logic. - Yes. - Correct When, where and how I must do the ritual? Viji, the gate opens on its own! Hey egghead, see well. That half pint is opening the gate. Leave the vehicle inside. I'll close the gate and come. Yes. You'll panic others, at once said as ghost house. This is the place where Yatchi is glorified. Uncle... It's good to be a ghost instead of being poor. All the ghosts reside in bungalows, isn't it? Yes, dude. I wish to be born as ghost in next birth. What about now? Are you looking like a hero? You're like a ghost. You better stay here. Now, I'm going to perform, Yatchi Samhara Pooja. The most important is the palm script with mantras. Only, If you find that, we can destroy the Yatchi. Guruji, won't that Yatchi harm us, till then? It won't come near to you till I complete the yagna. But, the other evil forces will hinder you not to take the palm script. Be careful. They said as rituals but now panic us... ...saying as ghosts and demons. Why do you panic? The peak of black magic and 'The mountain of witch craft' is with us. Swamy, you start the pooja. We'll search for the palm script. Let all be good. Hey... Don't leave me. Are you going for construction work? You accompany him and search out. Go up and search. We'll search inside. I'll take care. Oh no, a bandicoot. I've come. It's very dark. - What happened? - Don't be afraid. Why must I panic when you're with me? I'm not afraid. Why are the doors closing? Hey, It's good to be a ghost after death... ...and taking the offerings on new moon day as a crow. What attitude is this? If I nail down all the doors with help of carpenter... ...then you can't panic anyone. You'll be ashamed. I will get ashamed Then what, ma? Don't you have respect on us? See, the respect shown now. Have you noted the respect after snubbing. Hey, you must've that respect. Ma, you be seated. Won't you swallow even if numerous ghosts arrive? They don't know your power. Guruji Oh no, it's disrespect. You get up. What are you playing with so disrespectfully? Viji, I don't want any respect. We have come for an important matter. Oh no! You touched Mahadevi! See what happens now. He is teasing the ghost and in turn, it might tear me apart. Viji, don't go alone you'll be afraid Guruji If you get it, stuff in a bottle... ...I'll keep it on the TV. He too... Guruji, isn't there something? Just for fun. Hey, goof... You're playing unusual. Why should I fear? when Guruji is here. Why should I fear? when Guruji is here. Are you mad? Don't you know when to play? I'm not afraid. (Chanting mantras) Viji, it won't be in this room. Ma, it's not in this room. That's what I too said. Let's go down. Come. Come... We'll search in some other place. Come. Oh, escaped. Viji, what are you doing? There is a saying, if dog barks, ghost will go away. See, It's gone... Listen here. We shouldn't play with the invisible souls. Always the time won't be favour. Do you know what happens if it gets angry? Hold me. What sister, you're flying like a balloon? Chant the mantra. I'm in tailspin, You ask me to chant now. Pull me down. It's highly twirling! Jai mahishasuramarthini! Jai mahishasuramarthini! Jai mahishasuramarthini! Enough of it. Oh, my hand. You've become a mop head, still you cheat me. Oh, my hand. Look Viji... Hey, change the modulation and speak normal. Oh God! Greed of money, I do this job. But, intend to save her, I came along with you. If you're fake, then what about Bhattadhri? He too is fake. What's the stance of my uncle? Guruji Where did you go? You made me to tailspin like a goat. Come... You are thrashing the same person. Thrash the one who is hiding there. Leave me. Leave me. Hey, bandicoot. I'm escaped. Is the bandicoot gone? It's me! not the ghost. get me down. (Chanting mantras) I know everything. You're a cheating fellow. Sir, what do you do? Come, there is a ghost. It's no ghost. It's demon. It's well known to us. Come. Come and see. Is he? If I haven't come, both of you might look... -...through the door till dawn. - Yes. Why did you sent me along with him? He is panic stricken, when looking at ghost. Better, you would've sent me along with sister. If gone with her, you would've flee. Is she also a fake? Yes, both of them are fake. Bandicoot. Oh, no! When everyone is feared of ghost, Instead, he fears of bandicoot. See, it's of no use to believe them. Let's search alone. Come. Come? They are big wigs. Who? They? She is a fake queen and he is a fake top brass. You provoke me to yell at them. You are damn cheap. Come. It's a shame. We must do something. Wait. I have an idea. Don't turn. It's confirmed, there is a ghost. What to do now? How will you go if you see a creditor? I'll go with my face closed. Uncle. You search in this room. - I'll go this side. - Okay. Is it conjuring ghost? Dude's idea is right. I shouldn't turn. Hey egghead Hey... Hey, the ghost! A ghost is there! Hey, listen to me. A ghost is there! He didn't listen to me. Goof... (Chanting of mantras) - Who? - It's me. You afraid of your voice than the ghost. What are you doing instead searching for palm script? Come. Don't go there. There is a ghost. Nothing is seen. Not seen? I'll show you. It's there! Seen? Not seen now. It's there now! Not seen now. This is the problem. Hey loony, ghost is not here after switching on the light. Why do you play hide and seek still? - Go. - Keep quiet. The ghost was here. - It was here only, might do something. - Why are you searching now? Come and search for the palm script. My stomach got upset feared of the ghost. Have to rest somewhere. We have to take the palm script by cheating the ghost dressed up similar to it. Yes. How about my dressing? Feel like biting you. Hey, why do you panic me? Don't come close to me. Go away. You go that way and I'll go this way Go. My hands aren't wet. Then, how I cleaned up? Why do you come like a thief? I'll yell at you filthy in malayalam. Go, be normal. Go. He is dead. Who upturned it on my head? Leave my head. Leave me. The vessel stuck on my head. Someone help me, please. Who is that? Seems like Bhattadhri. Bhattadhri... Dude! Dude! Dude! Why are you shouting? Uncle, are they ghosts or basketball players? Playing with us vigorously Kiss me, close your eyes And Miss me Close your eyes And kiss me Come on...come on... I'm coming. Kiss me... Close the eyes... Kiss me... Uncle! Be careful, uncle. Uncle, blood is oozing. Better you take rest. I'll search, uncle. Dude, what you say is right. Go safe. - Will you take rest? - I'll stay safe, dude. I'll hit you, haven't you taken booze with me earlier for free? Come. Wish to sit idle. I have got a knife, not bothered about the ghost. Like cutting a cake why did you do this? - It's hurting, dude. - Shall I leave, then? No...no... take it slowly, dude.

Water. No time for that. We have to search for the palm script. Come. (Chanting mantras) I'm going to drink your blood. I'll be drinking... I'm not a ghost. Leave me. You're falling here and there and get hitting on your head. Get up... What's this? Your head is like a white washed pot. I thought of cheating the ghost dressed up similar to that. Can't you do anything without cheating? You have a hefty body even if the ghost... ...chase, you can't run. Why do you do this job? Where is the fake queen? She is coming with me and stares at me... A group of ghosts together here... I'll manage. Dude, check whether it is? Viji, check whether it is? Viji, check whether it is? Don't confuse me with fake materials. It's said as the palm script. It's like a notebook. Search for it. Simply showing off as if you're working. Don't hit me. Didn't take bath for years together it seems. It's a haunting smell. Turn that side. Step forward. Oh, no! It intruded into the door. Will it expect me to come in a similar way? We will become ghost after we dead Are they breathing after they became ghost? I'm coming Me? I will come They don't want entrance then why do they need this fort? They can go and be in the forest I'll open the door and come That is... I died only two days ago. So, I'm yet to get the power of intruding into the door. I'll get it in two or three days. Till then... Oh my ghosh! Save me... Hey come out. The bandicoot will hurt me, if I come out. Be seated.

Why everyone is shocked as if caught in 'Me too'? Why are you posing like you're in washroom? Hey, how cleverly you made me to love a ghost? Did you get caught by the ghost? You told that he is going to meet his fiancee. Why are you silent now? Tell him...tell him... Hey, as you perform suddenly, the co-stars can't react. See here, still he is reacting wrongly. At last, what that black magician has said? You're standing far. Come close. Why dear? He told me to spit on your face. It's good to believe even the ghosts. But, shouldn't believe people who are jealous like you. You planned to end my life, but my life has got a beginning.
