I've been sweeping and dusting, mopping. Just can't keep up with it. Hmm. I wonder what range that wolf poster is. Fifteen feet? No way. Twenty at least. Uh... uh... Although, I'm not sure.

No, he's not. My father's the best hunter. Yeah? Well, we're hunting wolves for the Lord Protector. Lord Protector put my father in chains for nothing. You English think you're so great, but you're not. You should all just go home. But first, give us a go on your crossbow. No! - You'll pay for that, English girl. - She pushed him! You're dead now! - What's going on here? - Soldier! Leg it! Uh. Why must you wander off like that, Robyn? I was trying to help you, and then there was a boy, and he said his father was better than you, - and then he wanted my crossbow and... - Robyn! We are not so welcome in this land yet.

No children beyond the walls. Lord Protector's orders. If he could just see how good I am, what a hunter I am, then he'd have to let me come along. What are you, Merlyn? A falcon or a chicken? - Kill the wolf! Kill the wolf! - Hmm? Leave me alone! Get away from me! Got you now, wolf! Aha! Lads, we got a flag! Come on! Down with the Lord Protector! - Oi!

What are you doing out here? - I was trying to help you. - Help me? I told you, you shouldn't be out here! This is why! - Father, they took Merlyn. - Lass, no. No, you're not going after him. Not in there. But we can't leave him. Look, I promised your mother I'd keep you safe. It's all right, love. You'll be safe back in the town. Come on. It's for your own good. By God, you're one lucky girl. Did you not see? 'Twas a Wolfwalker, by Crom! Now calm down, will you. Everyone knows you can't be cutting down their woods. If you do, they'll get you. Sure, that's the deal. There's no deal with anyone. Saint Patrick made it with the old pagans and you're breaking it, you eejits! - We need to clear the woods. - Did you not see? Actually, I did see the wolf attack. The way them wolves answered her call. Them forests is riddled with wolves, I tell you. Well, won't be long before the wolves are gone. It won't be long before they're inside the town walls with the hunger. No. No, we'll tame these lands. The Lord Protector has ordered it. Ah, the great Lord Protector. Renowned for being true to his word. Hilarious. At least the old king kept us safe. He's just an upstart. Lord Protector. Lord Protector. Protector of what? - Oi! - Come here! If you have grievances, you should speak with me directly. What are you doing? No! - Get your hands off of... - Hold still! - Jesus, Mary and Joseph. This is a joke. - Ah, get in. Let me out of here! I did nothing wrong! By Crom! The devil take your head! - Another wolf attack? - Aye, my lord. A few more like him and we have another rebellion on our hands. If we do not clear the trees, the farmers cannot work the land, and the woodcutters cannot clear the trees with these wolves. - This is not acceptable. - Aye, my lord. We must show them the wolves are no threat. They're just beasts. Finish them. Yes, my lord. And this is your girl, yes? It is, my lord. Uh, Robyn. There should be no child beyond the walls. Why is she not in the scullery? My lord, she... She doesn't work there. She... You! See to it that the girl reports to the scullery. Father. Do as the Lord Protector commands, lass. I ride out to deal with the revolt in the south. When I return, I want all the wolves gone from this forest. - Yes, my lord. - Goodfellowe, you have two days. Don't waste them. Hey, psst, girl. The one who took your bird, I've seen her before. A while back with her mammy. Cross my heart, she's one of them Wolfwalkers. Wolfwalkers? Yeah, Wolfwalkers. The ones that can talk to wolves, like. But you know, they can heal as well. Her mother healed me with some wild magic. Maybe she'll fix your bird up. Maybe she'll eat him. - I don't know. - Oh... I need to get him back. I'd say once we're behind them walls, neither of us is going anywhere. - Can you keep a secret? - Huh? Aw! My sheep. Lads, you didn't lock that gate right at all. You let them sheep out, didn't you? Oh, yeah. Blame me for that too. Everything is Seán Óg's fault! Get back in the cart, you. I feel like stretching my legs! - Help me with my sheep, you langers! - I'll show them out! Oi! Get him! Hey, whatever your name is, get back in that cart! Round up those sheep. Off of me! Have you no manners at all? Get back in there, you! An extra week in the stocks for that. - Where's the girl gone? - Don't see her. Maybe in the woods. Oi, you two, look out for a girl. She ran into the forest. Get her and bring her back to the castle. Lord Protector's orders. - Uh, yes, sir. - Devil take... English soldiers. Who do they think they are? Bossing us around. - What was that? - Uh, nothing!

I was trying to get you out of that trap. And anyway, you came into my woods. Your woods? They're our woods. Your wolves are attacking the woodcutters and the sheep. They should be staying closer to the town and so should you, townie. Now give us a look at you. - Are you seeing things? - Ugh! Get off me! - How's your smell? - Ugh! Stop it! Smells like townie. Any extra fur? Ugh! That's mine! Get away! Now, stop moving and let me fix it before it's too late. Hey, get off me! Will you stop? Let me fix it! Ugh! Fine. But what? Well, fixed now. Never happened. Off you go. You did heal Merlyn. Yeah. I fixed you and your bird and saved your life. You're welcome, townie. Bye! No, wait. Who's that? Is she your... your mother? Ugh. You better go or the wolves will eat you. What? But I don't... Oh, no. Too late. They're gonna eat you! No! Whoa! Ah! Run away, townie girl! The wolves are after you! Can't get away from us, townie! Get away from me! But you're so slow. Scared of your shadows, you are. What would a townie know about wolves? Why do you have so much stuff? Hey, stop! That's my gear for hunting! Oh, a hunter. Ha! A little girl like you? Uh, well, you're a girl too. I'm no girl! I'm a Wolfwalker! Whoa! Up you go! When I sleeps, I'm a wolf. When I'm awake, I'm me, Mebh! Mebh Óg MacTire! What's your name, anyway? - Robyn. - Robyn? Mm. I like birdies. I climb so high to catch them. I'm too smart for them, though. They can't get away from me for long. Ugh. Oh. Caught again. Some hunter. That's two for me, none for you. Whoa! Ugh. Stop being so annoying. It's not funny, you know. Argh! Let me down! All right, townie. If you say so. No, wait! Oh! Oh! Hey! Stop calling me "townie." All right, Robyn. Back home with you. Fun's over. Well, Mebh Ogamacatemera, your idea... - Shh! Do you hear that? - What? A man. I'll get rid of him. A man? Oh, no. Father. Ah! Just one townie. I'll give him a bit of a scare. No, stop. Huh? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. That was too close. What are you so scared of? We have a pack of wolves with us. Hey, I told you. You can't go out in the daytime. Mammy said so. Go back to bed. Is that your mummy back in the cave? Of course! Sure don't I look like her? And are any of the other wolves, uh, people too? No. Jeepers! Are you mad? How big do you think my family is? I'm not supposed to be out here. Listen, I've got to get back. Great, I'm mad to get rid of you. Close your eyes. What? Why? Don't want you coming back to my den. It's secret. But I already found it. Oh, just shut up and walk. I'll point you back to the town. No, I need my crossbow back first. What do you need that for? Shooting your bird again? No, shooting... Oh, never mind. This way, hunter-townie-Robyn-girl. Hey! Stop pushing so fast. Oh, will you stop complaining? Smell that? Ugh, Mebh. Town tasties. "Town tasties"? What? Where's she gone now? What did you tell them? Just she's going home, isn't she? 'Tis obvious. Ned, say if that wolf bit her, like, could she turn into one of them? A wolf? No. One of them half-wolf, half-witch, half-people? Wolfwalkers? Will you stop? We are cutting down their woods, Ned. Shouldn't be doing it. Save me from that nonsense. Seán Óg and the soldiers making us. But if old Lord Ironside doesn't sort out those wolves, it won't just be us who'll stop taking his orders. No more orders for me, Ned. Those town tasties are mine. I'm not after that. I need my crossbow back. Oh. All right. But those town tasties are mine. - No stuck-up lord in our city again. - No, we won't, Ned. Whee! - What? - What is it, Ned? Uh, the wind, maybe. Hey, what did you do with the spuds? The spuds, Ned? Hey, the bread's gone too. No spuds and no bread? - My hat. Give me my hat. - My bread. Give me that. Oh! There's someone in there! What the... My milk! Something took my milk! Go! Go! Go! They nearly caught us. Nobody can catch me, townie. How can you stand living in there? All the smells. Ugh! It is pretty smelly. I don't like being stuck in there. I miss England. What's an "England"? I used to live there. I could go wherever I wanted, play with my friends. It was really nice. Sounds like the forest. Merlyn and I even used to help Father hunt for food. Now he wants me to stay in town all the time. Stay here in the forest. It's great. - Loads of running. - Playing. Eating, messing, climbing. Free. I can't. I can't leave my father. He has to work for the Lord Protector and... Mebh, you can't stay in the forest either. They're cutting it all down. No way! I'll scare them off. The Lord Protector wants the wolves gone. Dead! You have to leave. We were leaving. Me, Mammy, with the pack. What stopped you? - Mammy went off. - As a wolf? Yeah, to find us a new place to live. I'm sure it's some huge den with no stinkers around and loads of food. It's going to be amazing! So then, where is she? Do you think she got caught? No. She's fine. Nobody can catch my mammy. And anyway, if she was caught by those stinkers, I'd get my wolves to eat them! So, you're waiting for her to come back? Yep. It's just her and me in the whole world. Like me and Father. But what if they find the den? No, they won't. Nobody has. Well, I did. Yeah. Only 'cause I let you. I have to tell my father about you. He didn't know... We didn't know that Wolfwalkers are real. That you were people. I better get back. Aw. Look, I'm gonna help you. Wait for me at the big tree tomorrow. I'll bring you some bread... I mean, some "town tasties." All right so. Smell you later, townie. Not if I smell you first. Oh. 'Tis yourself. Mm. So, they didn't eat you? That's great. You were right. That girl healed Merlyn. Didn't she, now? I told you. I better get back. So, you'll know where to find me anyways if you're looking for me. Father? Father? I've got to convince him. Hmm. We need to tidy this place up before he gets back. "My, Robyn, this place is sparkling." Thank you, Father. Take a seat. Put up your feet. "Don't mind if I do, lass." Hard day hunting? "Aye. Not a sniff of wolf out there." Well, what if I told you I can get all the wolves to leave and we don't even have to kill them? "I'd say you're telling tall tales again." Oh, but I'm not. Now, promise me you won't get angry. "I promise." You see, I met a girl in the forest who has magic healing powers. She healed Merlyn. And she's a Wolfwalker. "A Wolfwalker?" It's true. When she sleeps, she turns into a wolf. She can talk to the wolves. Her and her mother were going to take the wolves away, - but her mother went missing. - "Missing? Poor thing." I know, but if we can help her find her mother, then they can all leave the forest together, and you will have done your duty to the Lord Protector. "Oh, brilliant, lass. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you. Our problems are solved. We can go back to how things used to be." My girl, come here to me. Are you all right? How are you after that wolf attack? A bit shaken? No, I'm fine. Take a seat. Put up your feet. That's nice. And how was your scullery work? You must be tired, love. Well, about that. What if I told you I could... And Merlyn is back. My, you've had quite the day, lass. Yes, I have. But what if I told you... My day has been awful. Every trap I set this week has either been broken or sprung. Never seen the like of these wolves. Father, what if I told you I can get all the wolves to leave and you don't even have to kill them? Now, promise you won't get angry with me. Go on. You didn't promise. I know. Go on. Tell me. - You see, I went back to find Merlyn... - You were out in the woods? Father, listen. She's one of them. A Wolfwalker, like the woodcutter said. They're real! - You went back? - But, Father... You left the scullery? Well, I didn't actually get to the scullery. What? The Lord Protector ordered... - If we can just find her mother and... - Listen! You have to follow the Lord Protector's rules. He gave you a direct order and you disobeyed him. Have you no fear of the stocks? We need to work together to stay in this town, lass. I'll bring you to the scullery tomorrow myself. But please, I thought you would understand. I-I can help you. If we just... Help me by doing your work and staying in town, away from danger. Now, promise me. I promise, Father. All right. Now, go to your bed. Mother would have listened to me. She would have wanted you safe, Robyn. Sleep well. We'll find a way to help her, Merlyn. - Robyn? - Father? - You all right? - It's nothing. Just a bad dream. Well, should make an early start of it, both of us. Let's go. Oh, nice to have a new girl joining us. - Keep an eye on her. - Aye. - She's to work the full day. - Aye, aye. - Work is prayer, Robyn. - 'Tis all right, child. Sure wasn't I only half your age when I started here. Just do what you're told now, and you'll be grand. It's for your own good, lass. Work is prayer, girl. Better if you don't stop. Oh, no. Girl. Girl. Girl. Girl. Girl. Girl! Jesus, Mary, Joseph. Get yourself out of this room, girl. The Lord Protector has forbidden anyone from entering. You're lucky 'tis me that found you, child, not His Lordship. Put you in the stocks, he would. The Lord Protector expects his rules to be followed. Remember that tomorrow. Now, off home with you. Oh, now. There you are. Did you see your new friend again? Robyn! Come in. You'll catch your death out there. Are you a hunter or a housemaid? Work is prayer, Robyn. Then I prayed the whole Bible. Good lass. This is still new for you, but it's a righteous life for a young lady. Well, it's no life for me. I can get the Wolfwalkers to leave. You just need to listen to me... Robyn Goodfellowe, enough of your stories. I can go look for her... You must do as you're told. No more fairy tales. - But the... - No buts. - The Wolfwalkers... - Wolfwalkers are not real. They are real. Right, Merlyn? Huh? Merlyn, can you smell that? Merlyn, what's happened to you? I can see your scent. What? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. What? What do I do? How did this happen? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - Wolf! Wolf! Robyn, wake up! - Father, help! No, no, no, Father. It's me! Father! What was that? Did you see that? Mebh! Mebh! Robyn! Something's happened to me. Yeah, I can see that. I thought I'd fixed the bite. I thought you'd be fine. Oh, Mammy's gonna kill me. Well, my father will kill me. Huh? Hey! Calm down and give her room! Anyway, sin é. That's it. Now, I see you like this. It's flipping great! I thought we were the last ones. It's great? I'm a Wolfwalker! I know! Mammy said this would be bad, like, never to bite anyone, but I love it! Is maith sin! It is bad. I'll get killed like this. What about my body? It's asleep. Nice and cozy. Look, you're a wolf when you sleep, a girl when you're awake. No big deal! But the soldiers, and... and my father... Don't worry about that. Learn how to be a wolf first. Come on. Why do you want to be a human? Being a wolf is way better. I'll show you. Can you smell me?

You must go, Mebh. Lead the pack away to safety. I told you. I'm not leaving without my mammy. Mebh, you have to listen to me. You must leave the forest. Take the wolves and go. But... you said you'd help me. - I am helping you, the only way I can. - You promised. The Lord Protector will burn the woods. He will kill all the wolves by sunset. You have to get them out. Do you understand? Now go. You said you would help me. You promised. Go, Mebh. Take Merlyn with you. Goodbye. I hear he's got a wolf. I hear it's a giant beast to behold. Much bigger than a wolf. - Mammy? - Ah, won't that be a sight. Do you suppose he's going to kill it? Oh, yes. 'Tis a monster. - Mammy! - Crazy child! - Careful, girl! - Watch out! You'll hurt someone like that. Come on now, ladies. Everyone's to go to the courtyard. The Lord Protector wants everyone outside, girl. Come on. They brought out that big cage. 'Tis up on a stage. Oh, no. Listen to me! I'm the best soldier! Push! Push! A little further. Good. That's enough. Step away. Return to your positions. - Mebh, stop! Please. - My mammy's here! Get off of me! Mebh. No! People of Kilkenny, I have heard your concerns. Wolf attacks, livestock lost, a wolf running through our very streets. - But listen to me. Have no fear. - Mebh, stop. Get off of me! You must get out of here now. Let me go. Let me go. Hey! Hey! Over here! I've caught a wolf. - ...a civilized country. - Look! She caught the wolf. We cannot be... My fellow hunters, we have a new wolf to kill. No. No! Get off of me! I have to find my mammy. Get away from me. Robyn, stop. What are you doing? I'm gonna eat you all! Let me out! Mebh, your mother told me to keep you safe. You liar! You knew! This is for your own good. I'm sorry. Get the wolf, wolf... I have been sent here by the Lord himself to conquer the wild. And I will show you it can be tamed. Behold. - Wolf! - Mammy! - Kill the wolf! - Kill the wolf! Kill the wolf! Kill the beast! He has got a wolf. Enough! That's enough! Calm! Calm! You have nothing to fear from this beast. Now, open the gate. - Kill that wolf. - Come on now. You see? This once wild creature is now tamed. Obedient. A mere faithful servant. I will rid our land of all its wretched kind. Mammy. Mammy! Mammy! Mebh, no! Hey! Mammy, Mammy. It's me. I'm here. - What's this? What's going on here? - I'm here, Mammy. Let her go! That's my mammy! Let her go! Goodfellowe, take charge of this wild thing. Goodfellowe, can you not catch anything? What are you doing? Collar that demon and put her in the stock. Father! No! - Guards! - Stop! Don't move. Hold it right there, you wildling. Father! Don't! No! Robyn! Stay back! Father, stop! This is wrong! Robyn! Get away from here! Whoa! - A soldier's been bitten! - Father! The wolf bit him! Pull it back. Pull it back. - Whoa! - That's it. - Whoa! - Lock it up! - Oh, no, you don't! - Cover it, now! Mammy! Mammy. What have they done? Huh? Come here, you. Ow! I am a Wolfwalker! I'm getting my wolves and coming back for my mammy! Then we'll eat you all! People! Listen to me. Listen to me. Do not fear wild girls and wolves because tonight we put an end to this. I will burn this forest to the ground. I will lead cannons to the den of these beasts - and send them all to hell. - No! We shall prevail. It is the Lord's will. - Prepare a squadron. - Yes, sir. - Move along. - Get a move on. Move along. Goodfellowe, what have you become? You can't even catch a little girl? Prove yourself a worthy soldier tonight or tomorrow you are in chains. Now, put an end to that wild beast. What cannot be tamed must be destroyed. No, please. You can't. Robyn! Stop this. And for heaven's sake, put manners on that girl, or manners will be put on her. - Over here. Come on. - Steady, steady. Move along. - Come on, lads. Let's go... - Off home, you lot. Off the castle grounds. No, please. Father, please don't. Enough. Robyn, return to your duties. - But you can't. - Now, girl! Hurry! With that weapon, our victory is at hand. Robyn, what are you doing, girl? The Lord Protector will have us in chains. He's wrong, Father. All this is wrong. Don't you see that? Robyn, step aside. We must do what we're told. Why, Father? Why? I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Father? I won't be here to protect you forever. I'm so afraid that one day you will end up in a cage. But I already am in a cage. Wolves! Wolves! Wolves! Wolves! - What is happening? - Huh? I'm sorry, Father. Robyn! - The beast is loose! - What the... No! Grab her! Cover the gate! - Lower the gate! - Incoming! Fire! - No! - Don't let it get away! I tried to stop her, but I failed. She's gonna get herself killed. It's coming this way! Go on, then! Shut the gates! Draw the bridge up! Ready your arms! Go. Fire! Aim for the beast! Wolf! Watch out! It's time for us to attack those townies! Let's eat them all! They have my... Mammy? Mammy. Mammy! Mammy. Mammy, you're back. Mebh. Mm. I thought I would never see you again... until this one freed me. Mebh, I'm so sorry. I was only trying to keep you safe. Trying to help. I didn't know what to do. I was... - I'm sorry, Mebh. - Ugh. Aw, come here to me, townie. I'm not a townie anymore, Mebh. Thanks for helping Mammy. No! Mammy! No, no! Mammy, what happened to you? No! Mammy! Mammy! No! Robyn! - Mammy! - Robyn! Run! Quick! Mammy, what happened to you? No, Father! - Come on, Robyn! - No, Father! - You shot her! How could you? - Come on! Robyn! Run! Let me go! Mebh! - I have to help her! Let me go! - Back! - I said back! Stay back! - No! - What have you done? - Get back! Get back! Get away from here! Huh? Stop! No! Let me go! - Robyn! No! Stay! - Stop! Mebh! No! I have to help her! She's dying! Come on, Robyn! Let me go! Mebh! Mebh! No, Robyn! Why? I don't understand! Don't you see? I'm one of them. I'm a Wolfwalker. No, Robyn. Please. Stay with me. I can't let you go. Father. Robyn. Robyn! - Forward! - Ready arms. Formation! Goodfellowe, have you lost your senses? What is going on here? Robyn, she... She's gone. - Chain him. We'll deal with him later. - Yes, sir. That's a fresh track. Move on! Burn it all! Yes, sir. Forward. - Hold still. - Forward. - Burn the woods! - Burn it down! Oh, God, what have I done? Robyn... Robyn, wake up, please. Please. Mammy! Please, Mammy, breathe. I've never healed anything this bad before. It's gonna take time. I'm not leaving you, Mammy. Huh? I'll hold them off. Follow her. - Watch it, boys! - Ready arms! Get ready to march! They're in there! Advance! Aye, sir! Forward, men! Continue onward. Push, men! Push! We can drive them back. We are wolves! - Formation! - They have guns. A cannon. But don't be afraid. They're in our forest. Let's go! - Brave on! - Push, men, push! Keep going! Load your weapons. - Burn them out. Pick them off! - Yes, sir! - Spread out! - More fire! - Over here! - Burn it! - Huh? - Burn the woods! Onward! - Hey, more fire over here! - Burn it down! What on Earth is this? Spread out! Get more fire going over here! Take cover in the trees. Huh? Use the traps. Oh, bloody hell! Draw their fire. Then strike from the shadows when they're reloading. Report? Report? No! I can't, Mammy. I can't. I'm not strong enough. Please, tell me what to do. The pack. I need the pack. What? What is that? Run! Dear God. What was that? It's a Wolfwalker. Witchcraft. - Run! Get out of here! - What do you think you're doing? Reform your ranks! Get back to your positions! - We're surrounded. - Run! Huh? Have mercy! Have mercy! Fire! Fire at will! Fire! They're everywhere! Robyn. Robyn, go! Gunners, don't let them get away! Slay the foul beasts! Quick! Everyone, down here. I need your help. Robyn? Where's Robyn? Men, run and you will be killed! Follow my command and we will prevail. The Lord is guiding us. Robyn. Forward! Load the cannon! Aye, sir. Show yourselves, you wicked creatures. Come, meet your end. There it is, the devil's lair! Our victory is at hand! Gunners, fire! Take cover! Robyn! Musketeers... fire! Get back here! No, Robyn! Robyn? Robyn? Robyn, get up. Get up! Run! Enough, Goodfellowe. Foul bird! Stop! She's just a girl. By God's glory and punishment, he vanquishes thee. Robyn! No! Lord God Almighty, protect me. Goodfellowe. Into your arms, my Lord... I commend my soul. Father? Father. We have to help Mebh. Please, Mammy, don't go. Don't go. Don't leave me again. Please. Mebh. Robyn. I tried. I really tried, but I'm just not strong enough. I need her. I can help like I promised. Mebh, there's two of us now. There's two of us now. Show me what to do, Mebh. I don't know how. I'll show you. Follow me. - What is that? - Sorcery. Jeepers. Do you hear that, huh? 'Tis lovely music altogether. - Mebh. - Mammy. Oh, Mebh, my little wolf. Mammy, you're back. I thought you were gone again. I've missed you. Thank you, mo chara. My friend. Father. Don't go. Stay, please. You're one of us. Father, you're in our pack now. All is well, my love. All is well, Father. Come on!
