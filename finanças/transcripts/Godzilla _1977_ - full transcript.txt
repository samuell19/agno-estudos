The force that caused it was, up until recently, completely beyond the limits of man's imagination... ...a force lying in wait, ready to lash out against an unsuspecting world. There were many people here... but now only a few survive... My name is Steve Martin. I'm a foreign corespondent for United World News. I was on layover in Tokyo, en route to Cairo, and hoped to visit a friend. It turned out to be a visit in a living hell. Emergency hospitals were overflowing with the injured and dead... ...and there was a lingering fear that the events of the previous night could happen again at any time. Everyone who had survived and was able was helping to care for the human casualties... Emiko Yamane, daughter of a famous Japanese paleontologist, was one of those helping. For some there was hope, but for others there would be no tomorrow... I can't remember how long it was before one of the hospital units found me... I knew it was day out... and that I was lucky to be alive... Emiko, Emiko! Steve, Steve! So you survived... I'm very fortunate considering what happened last night. - It's a miracle that any of us made it through. Oh, Steve, what did we do to deserve this? I don't know, Emiko... I don't know. And your father, is he all right? Yes. He's in a meeting of the political leaders now... Just rest, Steve. I'll try to get you medical attention. It's still unbelievable that I'm alive when I think of the hundreds of thousands who are surely dead or dying in the ruins around me. Just a few days before I had been on my way to meet up with a university friend of mine... Serizawa... a scientist who was gaining great respect in the Far East for his unique experiments... Though it was unknown to me at the time, three thousand meters below an event was about to take place that would shake the very foundations of civiization. After what's happened since, it's impossible for me to believe that I'll ever see Tokyo like this again. Are you Mr. Steve Martin? - Yes I'm Shigeri, Dr. Serizawa's assistant. - Oh! It's very nice to meet you. How is the doctor? He's fine but he regrets not being able to meet you personally. - Is anything wrong? No, but he's away working for the Department of the Interior. He's conducting some experiments that are most important. He's very sorry he couldn't be here. That's okay. Did he say when he'd be finished? - Yes. He hopes to be before your flight to Cairo. Until then I'm at your service. I appreciate that. Excuse my interruption but I must ask you to come with me for questioning, Mr. Martin. - Is this a gentle way of telling me I'm under arrest? No, no, you're not under arrest. It's just imperative that you come wth me for questioning. - Of course! I'll take these. . . going to the Mikasa? - Nope! Hotel Imperial. Permit me... I'm Iwanaga. - Nice to meet you. Mr. Martin, do you remember anything out of the ordinary happening while you were on your flight last night? I read a bit, spent some time writing, and the rest of the time I was sleeping. - I see. I see you're questioning everyone on my flight. I'm interested in why. I work for United World News. I don't know what's going on, Mr. Martin... I just don't know. Or... if the public should know at all... I don't understand... - Early this morning a fishing trawler was swept from the face of the Earth in a matter of seconds. Was there any communication? - Yes. They reported a blinding flash... and that the ship burst into flame... Could it have been a mine or a collision? - If it had they would have reported a mine or a collision... Point taken... Well, I'd like to know whatever is being done about it. - All right. Come this way. This is the chart room of the Nanking shipping company... It was their ship that was reported missing... Do you mind telling me what they're saying? - They're at a loss for what could have caused the disappearence. Any survivors? - None have been reported... A search ship is on the way now - it should the ship's last known whereabouts soon... This is a message for George Lawrence. Care of United World News, in Chicago. Whole world stunned by Japanese ship disasters. Eight ships destroyed by a mysterious blinding flash of fire. No survivors. Radio reports give same message. Exactly. Terrible sea of fire engulfs all. Enormous death toll forces all shipping schedules be cancelled. Will remain in Tokyo unless word from you. Sign it Steve Martin. Right. Thanks. Like an illness panic crept across Japan... The Nanking Shipping Company was soon deluged with people demanding information about relatives lost in the shipping disasters. The few survivors who were found were suffering from shock and horrible injuries. With disaster following disaster the terrified people began to demand that the government take action. Security officials in the government called a special meeting. Consulting would be Dr. Yamane, Japan's foremost paleontologist. Excuse me... Dr. Yamane... - Oh, it's good to see you again. Do you really think that a monster might be behind these disasters? - Heh, who can say for sure? I heard you are heading an expedition to Odo island... - That's right, we leave this afternoon... I was wondering if it would be possible for me to go along... - Of course you can! You can meet us at the port at 2. Thank you very much. The port was full of well wishers for Dr. Yamane and the rest of his investigating team. But a feeling of dread was in everyone's mind... Every ship that had followed our course had met with a tragic end... Yes, we were all afraid... With the possible exception of Emiko and Ogata, a young naval officer... For the moment they were more interested in each other... When I had last seen Emiko she had just become engaged to Dr. Serizawa. It was the usual triangle. Most knew that, though engaged, she was having a secret relationship with Ogata. Odo Island, a small speck of land in the Pacific... It was home to a small population of natives who were the only witness to the disasters... It was decided that we would stay the night... It gave us an opportunity to be witnesses to a rare ritual... The islanders are surrounded by many dangers - some real and others imagined. This ceremony is dedicated to one of them... There is a legend here that, somewhere off the island shores, there exists a monster too terrible for any mortal to imagine... Long ago they used to send a young girl to the sea on a raft as sacrifice to the monster... And what did they call this monster? Did you hear that? Godzilla. Do they believe that this Godzilla is responsible for the recent ship disasters? - Yes. They're certain of it... It was more than just a storm in the night... much more... But just what exactly was unknown to most... The natives of the island knew, though. They said it was Godzilla... This well is contaminated. It's dangerous drink from it... Look at this... These indentions seem to be the footprints of some living thing! They're also radioactive... - This area is dangerous, please stand back! Emiko! It's a trilobyte - a three lobed worm that's supposed to be extinct! - Don't hold it in your bare hands, doctor... What does it mean? - It's a fantastic discovery! Trilobyte... isn't that a... What is it? - It's safer in the hills... Look at the size of those footprints... Two million years ago this Brontosaurus and other giant reptiles roamed the Earth in a period known as the Jurassic age... At this time an intermediary reptile evolved as well - a cross between the terrestrial and marine animals of the time... This creature is called Godzilla in accordance with the legend of the people of Odo Island. Judging by this photograph he is over 150 meters tall... So... what could have caused this creature to appear after so many centuries and so closely to the shores of Japan? One idea is that some miracle of nature allowed this animal to reproduce itself and, for centuries it lived peacefully with no reason to appear to us... but Geiger counter readings taken in the monsters footprints revealed the the presence of high levels of radioactivity and Strotium 90 - byproducts of the hydrogen bomb... It is my belief that Godzilla was forced out of hiding by the repeated testing of nuclear weapons... Can you hear me, George? - Perfectly! Hello. Steve, what else can you tell me about this monster of yours? It's huge and terrible - more horrifying than anything I could have imagined... You realize your story is front page news? What do they plan to do about him? They plan to kill it. The military is launching a depth bomb attack on Godzilla this afternoon. - That's fine, but how can you hunt something if you can't see it? The same way they find submarines - Sonar. The big questions is whether or not it will kill him. Well, keep up the good work, Steve. Keep me posted. - I will. See you, George. Thank you... Hello? - Excuse me, is this the home of Dr. Serizawa? Steve! You're a better reporter than linguist. It's good to hear from you! - I just got the message that you called. How did your experiments go? They went well. I just finished with them yesterday. Excellent, what about lunch? - Make it tomorrow. Emiko is coming over today and said she needed to talk to me... Check with you tomorrow then? - That would be fine. Goodbye! Emiko's engagement to Serizawa had been arranged and she was visiting him to tell him of her intentions to end it and marry Ogata. It was proving to be a difficult task... It's very good to have you home again... - It's good to be back... I'm glad we have this time to be together. There's something important I have to tell you. There is something I need to show you that is of even graver importance... - What? Will you come with me? - Yes. Stand back! Emiko, the world must not know of this. Please keep it a secret... - I promise I will. I won't even tell my father... What happened? - Nothing... Nothing happened... Father, what's wrong? - They are such fools... Godzilla's destruction is not the answer... He should be studied... Emiko, please make sure I'm not disturbed... Of course... It took less than a day for news of the depth bomb attack and the destruction of Godzilla to reach the streets. In Tokyo people were in celebration. But the celebration was not a long one. I couldn't tell Serizawa about us... - I understand, Emiko. Stay back, stay back! Stay back! He will be back... The damage had been severe but confined to the dock area. Godzilla was still in the bay and there was every reason to believe he would attack again unless some way was found to counter him. The military spared no man or resource in an attempt to stop the onslaught of the monster... Steve! - Make it fast... What'd you leave for? - I have to get this story off to the paper... Any new developments? Yes. They think they've come up with a way to stop Godzilla! How? - I'll show you! Tokyo is surrounded with a network of high tension wires. Should Godzilla attack, he'd have to break through 300,000 volts of electricity to get to the heart of the city... They're trying to have everything ready by nightfall... I need to get back... - All right. Thanks! See you, Steve! - Goodbye... The Japanese security officials ordered a full scale evacuation of all non-essential persons. It was a monumental job, but one that had to be done. By nightfall everyone was off the streets... The news office commanded a good view of the city and recieved constant radio updates of the situation... This tape recording is for George Lawrence of United World News, Chicago... Everyone remaining in the city was on a watch and wait basis... And the wait was not a long one... In Tokyo time has turned back two million years. This is my report as it happens. The gigantic monster the Japanese call Godzilla has just emerged from the bay... He's as tall as a thirty story building. Now he's heading towards the main line of defence: 300,000 volts of electricity strung around the city. I can't believe what's just happened... Now Tokyo has no defence! They are moving an entire tank corp to point blank firing range. I'm saying a prayer, George... A prayer for us all. The fate of the world may hinge on this attack... George, the tanks have been destroyed by a wall of flame. Neither man nor his machines can stop this monster now... Godzilla has turned the heart of Tokyo into a raging inferno - beneath the flames thousands, millions may be dead or dying... Nothing can save this city now... This is it George! This is Steve Martin signing off from Japan! Water! Hello, Emiko... - You've been sleeping very restlessly... Hello, Ogata... - Hi, Steve... Any new developments? - Not yet... there won't be any unless... Unless? - I was shown something that may be the only way to destroy Godzilla... Well what is it? - I promised Dr. Serizawa that I would reveal his secret to no one.... Emiko... Emiko, last night this city was destroyed... Tomorrow it might be Osaka or Yokohama... If you can help then you must... I had gone to visit Serizawa with the intention of telling him about Ogata... But there was something he had to show me first... Stand back! Serizawa had discovered something horrible... In his work with the oxygen molecule he had stumbled on a way to destroy all oxygen content in water and, thereby, destroy all living matter in it... An amount of his experimental chemical no larger than a baseball would be enough to turn all of Tokyo Bay into a graveyard... Serizawa had discvored a terrible force... and until he could find some positive use for it he didn't want the rest of the world to know of it... He made me promise not to tell anyone... - Emiko, we need Serizawa's help. There may be no other way! If I could just see him... talk to him... - Maybe I can convince him... Ogata will go with me... Whatever you do, Emiko... You must not fail... Have a seat! Doctor, I know of your oxygen destroyer. We must have it... - I don't know what you're talking about! I broke my promise, Serizawa... I told Ogata and Steve... They both agree that we must use it to stop Godzilla... No! - Serizawa! Doctor, doctor! No! You mustn't! We must have the formula! We must! - Let go of it! Please, I'm begging you, stop! Look what you've done! Help me! I'm sorry, Ogata... But the oxygen destroyer must not be used! If we don't defend ourselves now... against Godzilla... then what will become of us? And what would happen if a weapon such as I have invented were to fall into irresponsible hands!? Then you a great responsibility, doctor... To decide between your own fear and Godzilla... ...and which one you think is the greater danger to us... Attention, attention. At this moment a nationwide prayer is being observed for the survivors of devestated Tokyo... The voices of our youth are now offered up on high in commemoration of the destruction of today and in hope for peace and light tomorrow... Have you decided? Yes. But this kind of destructive force must never be utilized again! The location of Godzilla had been found... and preperation of the oxygen destroyer was complete... Serizawa insisted on helping Ogata to place the weapon... They've reached the bottom. Ready. - The doctor is ready! One of the men is up - it is Ogata... Serizawa is still in the water... Ogata, it's working! Be happy with Emiko... Goodbye! Pull him up! Respond! What are you doing!? Serizawa... He said, "Be happy." The menace was gone, but so too was Serizawa. Humanity is saved.
