Hello again, sir, and thank you for waiting. Your room is now ready. So let's get you settled in. As you can see, we like to maintain a nice, quiet atmosphere. Guests tend to appreciate that. There is literature in your room about the Renata and the facilities we offer for the comfort, enjoyment, and security of our guests. Well, if there's anything we can do for you? -Actually-- -You may reach us in reception within the prescribed hours. All the information is inside. Well, I'm sure you're eager to unpack and relax. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We hope that you are enjoying your stay at the Renata. Tonight's update is as follows. The swimming pool, located on the ground floor, is now available for use. Though strictly for exercise purposes. That is all. Night cap? No, thanks. Don't let his rules bother you. Don't just stop enjoying yourself. Well, if you change your mind... Good read? I just started. You can't beat a gripping story. Takes you right out of yourself-- Leave him be. So how will you fill your day? Just peace and quiet, is it, dear? He heard you. He's not interested. I'm sorry. What? In here again? Thought you'd just leave me to it, did you? My apologies if she's bothering you. No. So inconsiderate. I worry where you'll turn up next. How's my technique? I-- Sorry. You know, you're lucky to have me around. Keeping everything ship shape. Do it yourself, they call it. There's not many would put up with you sitting around all day when there's this place to be run. And those other two. You're not even paying attention to me, are you? It's hard even to talk to him these days. Especially now he's growing. Ah, a guest. Come here. I'm getting no cooperation at all today. Pass those to me. Here. Afternoon. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We hope that you are enjoying your stay at the Renata. Today's update. The billiard table in the game room located on the ground floor... is missing a red ball and therefore cannot be used. And remember, the pendulum of the mind... alternates between sense and nonsense... not between right and wrong. Hi. Evening. Is it okay if I join you? Of course. You sure? I won't be disturbing your read? No, I was just relaxing. We all need to unwind every now and again. You're in 267, aren't you? Sorry about that. The rules are kind of dumb. It's okay. I-- I don't mind. Mm, so you do hear us? No, I mean-- Yes. Sorry, I'm distracted. Relax. I'm teasing. It makes it, hm... kind of interesting. Right. You know... the thought of another man. Being just... there. Inches away. That does look like a good read. It's fine with me. Are you-- See you around. I can take them down if that helps. What do you need? Can you feel it? The nicotine. Soaking through the mucous of your lungs. Entering the blood. In eight seconds it's inside your brain. Forcing itself into your receptors, pretending to be part of the normal brain chemistry. But it's faking it. Increasing pleasure chemicals, improving short-term memory. Tobacco gets such a bad press, but it makes you feel... ...so good. I imagine lung cancer has something to do with that. Yeah. Nasty habit. Good evening. For the good of their own health and the safety of others, guests are requested to decline from the distribution of carcinogenic materials within this establishment. There are signs present in all public and private areas to remind guests of this important policy. So. Enjoying our little slice of paradise? Has its ups and downs. Or it's ins and outs, eh? Oh, I know all about those two. Come on. Yes. That again. Nasty habit. You have no idea. That's enough. Do you know whose room this is? I think you had breakfast with them. Lovely couple. Jesus. Very rude things, key holes. You notice that? The tight little ones for modern keys. The deep, wide holes.... the ones that take a big... solid key. Not even a little tempted? Hm. Oh, hello again, dear. I'm feeling quite peckish myself this morning. So, how are you enjoying your stay? Leave him alone. Hold on, friend. Good to see you again. Come in, join me. It's nice to see another face around here. Your call. Heads. Heads it is. Your break. How long have you been here? A while. Did you come up here for some rest? -A little bit of escape? -Mm-hmm. That's a good thing. Every man needs to escape from time to time. Helps him get things in perspective. Wouldn't you agree? I guess. Yeah, you're a smart guy, You? I'm not on a break, if that's what you mean. Business. Purely business. What business is that? Pharmaceuticals. -You're a scientist? -I wish. I just sell what they make. You should be careful. Oh, the manager and his rules. We wouldn't want that, now, would we? What? Well... forgive me for saying, but you're not looking great. Not like a man enjoying his well-earned R & R. I'm fine. If you say so. Have you... seen anything strange here? Strange? I'm not exactly sure I know what you mean. Forget it. You should be in bed, my friend. I can't. I'm-- I'm not sleeping. Well, I can help with that. Try this tonight... and tomorrow you'll feel like a new man. I can tell you I'm sure. -It's just-- -I know, a man you've just met gives you a pill. What's the catch, right? None. I'm just helping out a fellow traveler. What is it? Brand new. Top of the line. And perfectly safe. You'll get the best night's rest you've ever had. -Well, we'll see. -You will. Okay. How much? Put that away. That one's on the house. One pill is good for one night, But I have a lot more of these with me. I like you. So here's the deal. That next shot you were going to take, if you make it, then a dozen more of these babies are yours. No strings. And if I miss? Oh, you can still have the extra pills if you want them. But I need something from you. -What? -Relax, it's nothing sinister. I just need something picking up, I'm a little busy right now. You'd be helping me out, that's all. What is it you-- Looking at how you've set yourself up, I don't think you'll have a problem. Jack Ruby couldn't have asked for an easier shot. How about it? Weeks of blissful nocturnal release. Okay. Oh. Tough luck. Here you go. Try this. Trust me. And when you want a full dozen, you know what to do. What is it you need picking up? It's a key I misplaced. Find it for me and the others are yours. That's it? That's it. When did you last see it? What are we having? Right. Well... I guess it's my turn. Again. Actually... Okay, everyone. We hope that you are enjoying your stay with us. Here is a short reminder of the rules. This is nice. Isn't this nice? We never get to do this anymore. Mother? Are you happy here? Mother? Mum. With all this? Hm. Yummy. Yummy mummy. Do you want some more? It's good for you, Mum. Full of vitamins, enzymes... fructose. Hm. That's it. All gone. Well. Maybe one more. And the little train goes into the station. I'm sorry. I'm so stupid. -Are you okay? -I'm sorry. Please let me. I think that's-- -So, are you-- -Why are you here? Good evening, one and all. We're pleased to have you all here together tonight. To keep you entertained while you enjoy the carefully prepared food... we have a little welcome light relief. Ladies and gentlemen, without any further ado, may I present your first act for the evening. Good evening and thanks for bearing with us. She's a bit of a free spirit, this one, but we ran her to ground. So, I can see we've got a lot of familiar faces in tonight. Are we ready for a night to remember? Is this thing on? Thank you. Really, there is no need. I'll start you off with one of her favorites. Why do bees hum? I don't know, why do bees hum? Because they don't know the words. Speaking of bees, when I was young, my father asked me, did I know about the birds and the bees? And I said I didn't want to know. When he asked me why, I said, "Dad, when I was five, you told me there was no Father Christmas. When I was six, you gave me the whole, "There's no Easter Bunny" speech. And when I was seven, you told me there was no Tooth Fairy. So, if you're now going to tell me that grownups don't really fuck, then I've got nothing left to live for. Really? Maybe later. Thank you, thank you. You have been a great audience. You really do make it all worthwhile. But it's enough from me and more than enough from her. Say good night, dear.

There's so much going on. So much that needs doing and there's only one of me. We were supposed to have an equal share. That's how it always works. But lately, I don't know. You have to start helping out more. I need you to do your job. Otherwise this entire thing-- Why don't you just come in? Enjoying your evening? How did you find dinner? All very agreeable, we thought. It's a key I misplaced. Is there anything you need? A drink? Rules. Couldn't you relax that rule? What's the world coming to? Once you start bending the rules, what's then? I'm just-- A place like this needs controls if it's to run smoothly. I know you believe in that, don't you? - Well, I'm just-- - Thank you. Of course, there are always a few hiccups... bumps on the road. But between us we can sort those out. If you start to do your bit. Exactly. Jesus! Fuck. How do you get up here anyway? Wandering around the place. I'm just going to have to-- Oh! Good evening. Well, close the door. You'll let the warm air out. New hand. You're blind. What? You're the big blind. You put in two without seeing your cards. That-- that's right, isn't it? Indeed. I'm in. All right. Ah, I think I have you both. Well? Oh, just give me a moment. It'd be a shame to waste a moment. What? Do you really want the old guy to win? You want to cheat? If we don't, he will be here all night. Everything okay? I could have sworn-- Where were we? I believe you were about to fold. Ah! I think I was about to win. Okay then. Time to reveal our hands. -Ladies and kings. -I knew I had it. I'll be here for a little while longer, gentlemen. Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. I don't-- Uh, I think maybe it's time to cut your losses. Uh, yes. E-- Excuse me. Didn't take that so well, did he? Easy. How was your night? Good. I'll wager it was better than that. I'm a businessman and... I don't believe in giving more than I get. -We had a deal. -And we still do. You've earned these, but... ...if you'd care to play me fair and square one hand of blackjack, winner takes all. I'm not sure. It's lot more peaceful nights. You don't want to end the night a cheat, do you? Okay. I'll stick. Dealer sticks at 20. Looks like Lady Luck is with you. I know. No bombing. Sue me. Right. I'm sorry about last night. The family show? It's not easy. Uh-huh. He makes us do it. -What? -He makes us perform like that. He even provides the material. I don't-- It's his way of keeping control, to embarrass everyone. It makes me feel sick inside, but sometimes it's just easier to do what he says. Avoid the-- I'm sorry, I shouldn't be saying any of this. Avoid what? What does he do to you? He controls us. What? We're locked up. Tied up. How? Shackled. He shackles you? No, that's... that's not right. It's completely wrong. Anyway, I shouldn't drag you into this. And I'm ruining your swim. It's fine. It's not your fault. You do have good technique, though. -Right. -You do. Very smooth through the water. It's the sign of a good swimmer. Streamlined, peaceful, disturbance. Smooth and... slick. Still, the old man might set all the rules around here, but I think we both know who really runs this place. Secretly. Deep down. And with that comes all sorts of opportunities. Showering? What is it? A cordial invitation from the old man. -To what? -Dinner. It's your turn at the Captain's table. -Tonight? -In an hour. He's a stickler for routine. I'd understand if you declined, if it was too... awkward for you. Who'll be there? The dress code is relaxed, but not this relaxed. Uh, pea and mint. - Excellent. - Mm. This is delicious. Well, quite. Well done, dear. It's a shame not everyone appreciates the effort. Filling and light at the same time. It's very nice, yes. That warm, savory goodness just trickling down into your tummy. Thank you for the invitation. Oh, right, uh... well, it's good to have you here with us. I-- I suppose we should have done this before. Good idea all around. Is your daughter not joining us? Do you see a space at the table? And who would serve us? I don't mind helping. It-- it's a system. It's important. Oh, yes. It's all about control. It's all about balance. Because we have a lot of that at the moment. Next course. Clear this away. Uh, claret? Oh, you must. -Water's fine. -I insist. To the world as we like it. Had a very good swim today. - Hm? - Hm. Very... invigorating. I-- I must say, I'm enjoying my stay. Um, the facilities are excellent. Really? Uh, thank you. We do try to keep you comfortable and relaxed. So, um... what's the history of this place? Oh, just a quiet place. Always has been. Always will be. -Well, this is farcical. -Quiet. -Why? -Because I say so. -Because you always say so. -Yes. Because this is your table. Yes, it is my table and my rules. Ah, the rules. Bingo. Look, I don't want to cause any-- Please-- please stay out of this. This shouldn't concern you. -Of course it fucking should. -Enough. My rules are there for a purpose. -They are absolute. -Really? We are not having this conversation. -We have a guest. -Well, maybe he has a view. Actually, I'm-- I'm a little tired. Are you all right? I'm fine. This was-- Good evening. It's okay. I'm not here to hurt you, don't be afraid. No. You can't help me. This isn't right. I know. I can stop it. Please trust me. Take my hand. Nasty habit. I was just-- It's okay. Relax. I don't care. We all have our needs and yours right now is crossing that threshold. You should've just asked me. Like I said, all sorts of opportunities. All yours. - Hey! - Oh, are you joining us? - What in God's name? - Get out. What the hell is going on? Get out. This is wrong. Do you even know what you're doing here and who for? What are you sick people trying to do? -Right, that's enough. -Ow! What kind of charnel house is this? There are children exposed to this depravity. Let go of me, you bastard. Enough! You must stay in here. It's for your own good. The show is over. All of you, back inside. If I hadn't got there when I did-- oh, this is all too much. He's out of control. There's just no balance anymore. Do you hear me? I can't do this on my own. I need you to do something very special for me. I need you to go to his room. You're going to help him. You know what I mean by that. Ah. No, don't. Please. Does this thing even have a name? Is it a babyish name like... Foo Foo or... Missy Munchkin? Or is it a practical... functional name like... -Rag Dolly? -No. You will make him see how special you are. Do you understand? -Do you understand? -Yes. There. That was easy, wasn't it? Make it special for him. If I have to take Rag Dolly out again, she will go back in blackened pieces. Clean yourself up first. He'll need you pretty as a picture. Go on. Now. Do you like this? What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We've got to get you out of this place. You're not safe here. It will be okay, but we need to leave now. Do you see what he's doing? Corrupting your investment, taking it from you. They must be stopped. Out of the way. What have you done? I'm just getting started. Come on now. Open this. Be reasonable. This isn't how it works. We could sit and talk about it, old man, but that isn't really my way. Hotel guests, ignore the alarm and please return to your rooms. Everybody return to your rooms immediately. This is an urgent safety announcement. No running in the corridor! No cutting other guests! Stop it! Leave it alone. This is no place for you. Now you're free. No. No! What were you thinking? No... running... corridors. No... rules. ♪ There are loved ones ♪ ♪ In the glory ♪ ♪ Whose dear forms ♪ ♪ You often miss ♪ ♪ When you close ♪ ♪ Your earthly story ♪ ♪ Will you join them in their bliss? ♪ ♪ Will the circle ♪ ♪ Be unbroken ♪ ♪ By and by ♪ ♪ By and by ♪ ♪ Is a better home awaiting ♪ ♪ In the sky ♪ ♪ In the sky ♪
