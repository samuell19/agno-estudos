[MEN CHATTERING] - Teng! - Yes, boss? Where have you been? I've been waiting for you. Hey. What are all these crap? [CHUCKLES] Boss, that's what you think. Take a look at this bike, it may be missing a tire but look at its export-quality handles. A sewing machine that doesn't work. And this, ta-da! Roof from the house of our national hero Jose Rizal. I got it for a cheap price but it's antique and expensive. - Expensive? You idiot! - Ow! Why? These are all rusty! But, boss, it won't be antique if there's no rust. - Look at you–rusty. - What are you trying to say? - Ow! - You're so lazy! You know nothing, but eat! You should be fed to crocodiles! Ow! - Damn it. - Boss! - [CLATTERS] - That's just great. I just want to work and now this. Teng, there's no medicine for idiocy. Same on a face like that. You're tough. - You want to fight me? - Did I say I want to fight? [KIDS CHATTERING] - Alright. - Here's your change. [WOMEN CHATTERING] Good evening, Rose. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hey! You really have the guts to court my niece. You're interested in foreign-looking women? - Rosemarie, go inside! - But, aunt, I thought– No! The dishes are waiting. Wash them. But, aunt, how can I? There's no water. There's some in the pail. Then you get the tabs and then you bush. Aunt, what do you mean tabs and bush? Oh, come on. Get a dipper and use it! Rosemarie, this is for you. - Thank you. - That's so cheap. - Bread? - Return that bread. - But, aunt! - The dishes are waiting. Tengteng, next time, bring some chocolates. Focus on the dishes. What are you standing there for? I'll go now. - Tengteng. - Yes? Next time, take a bath before facing other people. - Mrs. Tinay, are you sure that it's me? - What are you trying to say? - This idiot! - I don't mean anything! - Got to go. Bye, Rosemarie. - What are you trying to say? Don't show your face here again! [SCOFFS] Oh, just go on with your food. - Three. - [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Tengteng? Tengteng? Tengteng? Tengteng? Tengteng? - Tengteng! - Come in. Oh, Bugoy. I was just preparing your jeans. [SNIFFLES] Bugoy, what brings you here? Teng, I have a problem. I think I'll be having one, too. My grandma is sick. I knew it. I thought your grandma was already dead? This is a different grandma. Come on, Bugoy. You have a lot of grandmas. Almost every month, someone from your family is getting sick. I belong to a big family. Could you lend me some money? For medicine. - How old is your grandma? - She's about 89 years old. Bugoy, maybe you should let her rest in peace. Hey! I love my grandma! Oh my. Stop being too sensitive. About that money. My grandmother also got sick and... - [YELPS] - You want me to hit you in the face? Relax, Bugoy, buddy. I have a dream of becoming an actor. Don't you have the money? I won't lie to you especially when you want to make crackers out of my face. I don't have the money, I swear. What's this? That's not money, that's just some bottle caps. [CHUCKLES] So you have the money. - I do? Where? - This! - I'm borrowing this money. - That's not mine. - Really now. - Wait, Bugoy. You don't even know that there's money in this. Just tell the owner that I borrowed the money. Wait, Bugoy. What if the owner asked me when you will be paying? What should I tell him? Tell him that I will pay him when I'm able to. - No money. - Bugoy! Bugoy, the money. - [SCOFFS] - [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] That's what you think. Ten, twenty, thirty... [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] - Hey! - Oh, no! - What are you doing? - Nothing. You're just thinking of Tengteng. Of course not! Go to sleep, Yoyong. I saw you eating that bread he gave you. Shut up, I'm getting mad. There's a lot of food. - We can eat these. - Put them here. - We hit the jackpot. - Hey, what are you kids doing? - This is our food. - Food? Don't eat that, that's not clean. Take this. - Who's she? - My sister. Don't eat this, okay? It's not safe to eat. If you need more money, look for me at the junk shop. Name's Tengteng.

I told you to prepare my jeans because I need them tonight. - But you didn't. - Hey, wash mine first. - Okay. - Wash mine first. Sure. - Buddy, I have some bottles here. - Perfect. What a life. I'll be washing their clothes again. Damn it! Wash your own clothes! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLES] You know, mom... Dad. Grandpa. Maybe... If you haven't left me alone. I wouldn't be dealing with trash. I could be a doctor. But... This is maybe how life is. You just have to bear a little. A little hard work. If there's no hard work... there's no success. But. I promise you, mom, dad, grandpa. Time will come. That you will be proud of me. I promise you. Isn't he deserving yet? I think his heart is pure. We still need to know for sure. So we can be sure of his purity and loyalty. Looks like you've found the one, grandpa. I think so. I think so. Drink up, it's my treat. - No problem. - We need more drinks. More beers here. Bochok, get the beers. - Bring them here. - Look, it's Teng. - Where? Hey, Tengteng! Wait! Tengteng. - Teng, let's have some drinks. - I have an errand... Come on. I thought, we were friends.

We just had it filled, right? Wow! - Why? - The tank leaked again. - Stay here. - Where are you going? - I'm going to look for a gas station. - I'll go with you. Just stay here, and watch the car. My dad will kill me. I took it without his permission. Rody, I don't want to stay here by myself. This won't take long.

Rody, is that you? - [GROWLING] - [SCREAMING] [GROWLING] [WINDOW BREAKING] Jesus, they do it everyday now. This isn't humane anymore. Aunt, you shouldn't read things like that if they're just going to scare you. Hey, Rosemarie. Listen to me. Your mother and father sent you here. In the republic of the Philippines so I can take care of you. You and your cousin Yoyong. Mom, just say it in Tagalog if you can't say it properly. - It's embarrassing. - Yoyong, shut up. You need to be careful. Look at this newspaper, there are a lot of kidnappings happening. If they kidnapped you, how are we going to pay them? With these pots of soup? - Coke, please. - Get coke. You should be careful. We need self defense. Teng, what happened to you? Are you watering your head so you could grow some brains? Morning, Rose. Morning, people. Well, it's nothing. I have a cold. You're catching a cold? No, I'm not catching it, it's here already. You should stay home and rest. - Well... - Hey, woman. Since when did you become a doctor? Come on, go upstairs. Hurry up. But, aunt. I'm not doing anything wrong. Yes. But what's wrong, is this guy! Come on, go upstairs. Hurry up. And you, Teng. You're like a fly wandering around here. Are you hoping to get some rusty junk here? Mrs. Tinay, maybe you want to sell me your pots. Get lost! You're pissing me off. Get lost! Scram! - But I want to eat. - No, you're not allowed to eat here. I'll give you some poison to chew on! Scram! Don't ever come back! You're spreading dirt here! Scram! Fishball! Fishball! Fishball! Old man, hold on. Are you trying to kill yourself? I'm just planning to sell this. I'll carry it for you. You shouldn't be carrying things this heavy. [GRUNTING] Ouch! [MAGICAL SWOOSH] Well, this is quite heavy. No, you just lost your balance. It's actually very light. Lift it again. This is light? - See? - You're right. Let's go, old man. Good thing the boss is here. What is this? It's called a barbell, boss. I know what it's called. What is it doing here? I was wondering if I could sell it to you. I buy metal, not rust. Remove this dirt from my shop! What should I do now? I'm sorry about my boss, old man. He got rich from being greedy. I don't know what to do. I really need that money. Here, old man. This is all I got. - Take it. - You're buying it? I'm not buying it. You can sell it somewhere else. Not to someone, like my boss. This is my gift to you. It's not yet Christmas, why would you give it to me? Just take the barbell. [CHUCKLES] Well. What will I do with that? I didn't dream to be like Rambo. There are only a few people in this world like you. You deserve to be given a gift of power. Power? What do you mean? Take care of that barbell. You will understand everything at the right time. No one deserves to be the owner of that barbell, except you. But, old man, what am I supposed to do with this? I don't have enough space in my room. And... Old man? Old man? Old man? This damn barbell. The rust is really thick. Damn. I won't stop until you're all cleaned up. I think I overdid it. [POWER SURGING] What's happening? - Don't be afraid, Tengteng. - Oh, my God. You have been blessed. You are one of a kind. The barbell chooses you to be the bearer of its power. Me? Old man. Please, please don't do this. I have a heart problem. You will embody its power. The world is on the brink of destruction. You will save mankind from the forces of darkness. What? Me? Every time humanity is threatened by the forces of evil lift the barbell and call out the name– ''Captain Barbell'' And you will embody its power. Wait, old man. You are the chosen one. Why me? You will understand when the time comes. Oh my, Tengteng. What is going on? What did I get myself into this time? [KNOCKING] Tengteng! - Yes? - Tengteng! - Yes? - Why are you talking to yourself? It's nothing. - Who are you talking to? - No one. Go to bed, it's late. - Go to sleep! - Okay. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - Have you waited long? - Not really. Sit down. Al. I know what happened. I read it in the newspaper. What now? What will happen to you? I don't know. I really don't know. Why don't you just surrender to the cops? Or try seeing a doctor. - Maybe they can help you. - No. They can't help me. Al. I just want to end this. But how? Al, there's still God. No! Al. Al! Wait, Al! If you won't surrender, what will happen? What about me? What about our future? You said it before... That life isn't always about darkness. That there's also light. That our life will be as beautiful as the break of dawn. What will happen to us if you won't surrender? If you will die. I will be thankful if I die. Stay away from me, Elvie. I can't bring light to you. I am evil–a demon who kills innocent people. Do you want to be part of this curse? If only I knew what to do to stop all this. I would have done it. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - Al? - Elvie, you have to leave! Get away from me! Go! No! I won't leave you! Al! Al! Al! [GAGGING] Al? Al? [SNARLING] - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - Al, no! - Rose. - What? Rose. Rose. Tengteng, aunt might hear us. You know, Rosemarie, your English is nice. Stop teasing me, Tengteng. But it's true. Can I invite you on a date? Where will we go? Over there, over there. Where? - Just around here. - Around here? Where exactly? Just someplace. Tengteng, how will I tell aunt that we will go ''Just someplace.'' Jesus. Why, do I look like a rapist to you? Don't be silly. So what do you say? Just call my name, and I'll be there. We'll see. But I guess we have to bring Yoyong with us. I'm in, as long as, we bring Bing, too. Oh gee, oh my, oh God. Rosemarie, I'm courting you, not your cousin. I'm sorry, Tengteng. But I don't think my aunt will let me go out without a chaperone. - Hey! - [GASPS] Rosemarie! We have plenty of customers, to the left and to the right. And you're chatting with this guy? Aunt, we were just chatting. - Rosemarie, go upstairs! - Aunt! If you don't want to go, just cook in the kitchen! Tengteng, if you want to chat go chat with Father Cruz at the church, not here. I'm just trying to relax. I don't believe this idiot. Do you think this is a park? Hurry with your food, and scram. - Hostage! - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Mrs. Tinay, Bing is taken hostage! She was taken by the crazy guy! He took her to the City Hall's rooftop! - He will kill her! - What? - What? - It's true, people are panicking. - Come on. - Let's go! - Please! - I am Rambo! - No, please! - This woman is mine! - Calm down. - Excuse me. Let us through. - Excuse us. - Let us through. - [BING SCREAMING] - What are you looking at? Aunt, it really is Bing! - Bing! - Help her officer! - Go away, or I'll kill her! - Please, help me! No! Officer, what are you waiting for? Help her! - Bing! - Call the fire department! Or, Mr. Ramos! Anyone! - Go and help her! - He might push her! Excuse me, coming through. Step aside. Step aside. Step aside. Give way. - I will kill this woman! - [BING SCREAMING] Sir, whoever you are, let the woman go. No, she's staying with me. [MAJESTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Captain... Captain... Captain Barbell! [CHUCKLES] Captain Barbell? [GRUNTING] It's not working. Tengteng. Tengteng. Use your right hand. Not your left hand, and say it again, ''Captain Barbell''. - Right hand? - Yes, your right hand. [HEROIC MUSIC PLAYING] Captain Barbell! - Bing. - Chief, what are you waiting for? - Help her! - Aunt, let them do their job. Mom, enough with the acting, the TV crew isn't here yet. Get down from there! You keep telling him that! Stop meddling! Shut up! Get down from there. We will give you five seconds. If you won't, we will be forced to take action! - Where's Tengteng? - Mr. Officer... - What? - He's gone. - Please, help her. - Your boyfriend's a coward. Excuse me. He's not my boyfriend. One! Two! Three! - Four! - [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Who fired the shot? - [GUNSHOTS] - Who fired the shot? [GUNSHOTS] Rosemarie! Aunt! [SOBBING] Don't cry. Aunt! - I'll leave him to you, chief. - Thank you. - Who are you? - That's not important. Take him. [CLATTERING] - Hello, my Rosemarie. - Go away! What's wrong? Why are you mad? I'm not your Rosemarie! You're a coward. Besides, look at what happened. We went out for a while during that crazy incident people took all our food and nobody paid for them. But I paid for my food. I'm ashamed of you, Tengteng. You are such a coward. You ran away. - No, I didn't! - Where were you then? Well, I was... - Where was I anyway? - See what I mean? [SCOFFS] Coward! Rosemarie... [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] That's just great. Whether you explain... or not. Whatever. - Why is there a hole in my roof? - I don't know, boss. I don't know. - Where's Tengteng? - He's outside, doing some stuff. That damn kid, he put a hole in my roof! Hey, man. Look! What is that? I don't know. What are you doing here? You need something? Nothing, we're just fixing your bed. Nice room you have here. See you. Aunt, it's already late. Why don't you just go tomorrow? If I go tomorrow, that woman will escape again. It's now, or never. Mom, you never learned not to lend money. Now you're giving yourself a problem when they don't pay. What can I do? I'm a charitable person! Charitable is different from being gullible. Shut up, you two. Shut the windows and the door, too. Okay, I'll be back soon. I will get my money from that witch. My canteen was robbed, because of that hostage incident. I need capital. But, aunt, is it safe to go outside now? See this? They shouldn't mess with me. Or they will get holes in their waists. Keep the windows closed. The door, too. - Remember not to let anyone in. - Yes, aunt. Shut the door! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Good evening. Good evening. Can I ask for directions? Do you know where Real Street is? Good evening. Good night. Good evening, Mrs. Tinay. [SCOFFS] Demon! Thank you. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - [SCREAMING] A monster! Help me! It's a monster! A monster! Help!

Put him in the cage. Untie me. What? Are you an idiot? What if the She-spider caught us? - She'll definitely kill us. - Right, so don't try to escape. She'll kill us eventually. We'd rather die fighting. I don't want her to eat us alive. Go on, untie me now. I'll do it. Hurry up. Untie the others. Let's go. - [SHUSHING] Keep quiet. - Hey, get up. - Wake up. - Hurry, the guards might hear us. - Get up. - Hey, get up. - Hurry. - Hey, come on. We'll try to escape. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [AWRY MUSIC PLAYING] I'll go first. Go over there. Keep going. There. [MUTTERS] Hurry up. - Hurry. - Keep going. - Wait up! - Hurry. - Wait! - Hurry up! Hurry. Hurry up! [ROARS] - Run! - Hurry! [CHILDREN PANICKING] Let's help him! [GROANS] Let's get him! That's enough. - Let's go. - Run! That's enough. - Careful, you might fall. - Hurry, let's go. Hurry. [SCREAMS] Stop, She-spider. Please don't. They're innocent. It's all my fault. I knew you'd be a nuisance. You will pay for what you did. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Everyone, watch this! Watch this. So you won't try to escape again. [CHILDREN CLAMORING] [SCOFFS] We finally meet, Captain Barbell. Now, we will see who is more powerful. Do you want to see what I do to naughty kids? Is it the power you're bragging about? If you're really powerful, why are you picking on kids? Is that so? Do you think I can't fight you because I'm a woman? I'm not just an ordinary woman. In world history, we, women, fought against many civilizations. Well, prove it! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Narda. I think Tengteng's life is in danger. He needs your help. Okay, grandpa. Darna! Go ahead. Alright. [EXPLODES] Tengteng! Tengteng, I'll go after She-spider. [EXPLODING Captain Barbell! Oh, shoot. Captain Barbell! Yoyong, take care of the kids. She-spider! She-spider! [EXPLODES] [EXPLODING] [CHILDREN CHEERING] It's Darna! Darna, higher! Fly higher! I'll send Yoyong home. - Take care of the kids. - Sure. - Sure. - We're going home finally. [WHOOPING] - Fly higher, Darna. - Higher! Fly, Darna. You're amazing! Pork blood stew. Yoyong, promise me... that you'll never tell anyone about my true identity. I promise. It's important to keep his identity a secret. If anyone finds out, Tengteng will be in danger. He's your friend, right? - I'm your friend too, right? - Of course. It's our secret. It's between the two of us. No. It's between the three of us. You, me, and Tengteng. - I can't believe that you are Tengteng. - [SHUSHING] You promised. Get inside. - [SOBBING] - Mom. Aunt, it's Yoyong. - Yoyong, my son! - Mom. I'm glad you came back. -You bastard! - [GROANS] Where have you been? Didn't you know that I'm worried sick about you? We've been looking for you all over the place. We called the police, we even called radio stations. - And TV stations. - Where did you go? - Hi, folks! - This moron! It's all your fault! You took my son with you - to go places. - Me? No. No? Because of you, my son learned to disobey me! Hey! Get inside! - I said, go inside! - [GROANING] You see, Rosemarie. I'm not doing anything wrong. - but your aunt– - Look, Tengteng... you're useless, you're just a garbage boy. My aunt doesn't want a garbage boy for me. She wants a decent man for me, like Captain Barbell. Please leave, I'm closing the restaurant. Captain Barbell? [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] What a life! Damn it! Who is she proud of? You? I can lose you whenever I want. I don't care if I'm Captain Barbell. Damn it. This is your fault, you moron. You are a curse. I will lose Rosemarie because of you. Why are you mad at me? Of course not, who told you that? Then what does that mean? Well... Forget it! Tengteng, didn't you know that because of me you've done good things for many people. Yes, to other people. What about me? You haven't done anything good for me. You know how much I like Rosemarie. But what did you do? You're taking her away from me. The woman who I'm willing to pray for on every church From Laoag to Bicol. I even prayed to the saints to convince her to go out with me. But what did you do? Why? Is that your problem? What do you mean? Look, Tengteng. You and I are the same people. Don't you understand? I am you. Come on. Don't be silly. Look yourself in the mirror. Do I look like you? As you've said, I am nothing without you. That is true, Tengteng. But didn't you realize that my strength and my courage to fight evil they're coming from you. They only see a fearless man who can fly. They don't realize that anyone can fly. Anyone can be a hero. As long as their heart is pure. And those who believe in righteousness. That's the truth. Right, Tengteng? Always remember in every battle, no matter who your enemy is... as long as you know that you're on the good side you will never lose. That's the law of the world. That is the all-knowing truth. I'm just a friend who's willing to fight for justice. Don't lose hope no matter what happens. Change comes from within you. Never trust anyone but yourself. If kindness and change doesn't come from within yourself, you can't expect it to grow. It's you, old man. Tengteng. I'm taking back the power I've given you. Why? I'll still give you some power that you can use. You can use this little barbell. Oh? Old man! Old man? Old man. Old man, wherever you are. I'll ask for your help this time. You know how much I love Rosemarie. There's only one thing that can make her love me. I want to show her that Tengteng and Captain Barbell are the same people. It's your call, Teng. Again, you only have little power. It doesn't matter, I'll still use this. Rosemarie. [CHILDREN PLAYING] - Rosemarie. - Leave me alone, I'm busy. You're busy counting tricycles? No, I'm busy thinking of my hero, Captain Barbell. - Captain Barbell. - Cousin. - It's Tengteng. - So? [CLEARS THROAT] Rosemarie. This will be your last chance. I'll say it one more time. - And this will be the last time. - Tengteng, will you shut up? I already told you that I'm busy. Well, you know my motto is to keep on trying. Keep on trying. Besides, I already told you that my heart can only belong to one man. Who is that? The taxi driver? The man who loves porridge? Introduce me to him so I can beat his ass. You are no match to him. Teng, why did you bring the barbell with you? I got this. Wait, who are you proud of? Is it Captain Barbell? Now, you will meet the real Captain Barbell. Teng, what are you planning? I can't take it anymore. It's now or never. Your cousin needs to know my true identity. But it's our secret. We need to keep it a secret. - What secret? - Hey! - What's going on here? - You too, Mrs. Tinay. You treat me like dirt. Now is the time for all of you to know the real Tengteng. - [MUSIC PLAYING] - Tengteng, no! - Tengteng, don't do this. - What's going on? Tengteng, the power you have is very little. Just a reminder. Captain Barbell! Tengteng! Where's Tengteng? - He's gone. - He's Captain Barbell. Oh, no. What happened to me? - Why did I shrink? - Is that Captain Barbell? That's the Dwarf Captain. Old man, what happened? What happened to me? Tengteng, anyone can be a hero. You don't need to use others to prove your worth. Within you lies the power of change. - Come on. - Hurry! I can fly! Old man, why am I flying this way? Help me, old man. [SCREAMING]
