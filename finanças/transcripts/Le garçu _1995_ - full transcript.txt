For Simone Danton I'm coming to talk to you. But I'm not here anymore. No, wait. You're hurting me, Antoine. Stop hanging off me! I want to see someone. Tell him... Oh! What...? - It was me. - Let me hide first. Take the feet. If I were... You put on my boxer costume, and I'll put on the... The bear costume? But the bear's too big for you. - Come on... - Look! I'm not a costume, I'm a real bear. - Come on, come on... - What do you want to do? Sit down and stare. You can be the bear, and I'll be here. I'm here! You scared me! Listen! I've had a great idea. Let's hear it. You're a cowboy and I'm a cowboy and out there are Indians. - Not very original. - Yes, it is. - I'll have to think about it. - Why do you have to think? Brain needs to warm up. What does it mean, to think about something? It means you try to have some thoughts, and to think of some that aren't too dumb. And if we have dumb ideas, then we don't play. We don't play. - But if you have bright ideas... - We play. - Right, that's why I'm thinking. - Yes. Here's a wonderful thing. - What? - I have a good idea. Go on, tell me. I need to think about it. Can you feel your brain warming up? But it's already warm. - It's boiling... - Yes, it is. It's boiling. Touch my brain. - It's hot. - It's really boiling. It's 2,190. Can you get me 44 42 00 88 on the phone? Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. Hey, it's me. I've got nothing for Antoine. Can you come out and buy him something? I bought that thing for Isabelle, and I got you a suit at Dorothée Bis, it's a collarless jacket. I'm not sure about the size. I tried it on the salesgirl. It didn't look good on her, it's all ruffled. You know me. Now's not the time, it's a sale. Listen, I'll go and get the tomato sauce. Love you. See you later. - How much did you say? - 2,190. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Mommy, there's someone at the door. It's open. Where is my present? - Your present? - You don't have it. Yes, I do. Give me a little kiss first, darling. Just a little kiss. I said where is my present! Is it there? I haven't seen anything. - There. - It's here! Your present. I wonder what it can be. - Will you give me mine? - Here, honey. - I hope it fits you. - Thanks. I'll go and try it on. - Where's Isabelle? - She's with Antoine. Ah, there you are. - Alright? - Yes. I have a present for you. Oh, you shouldn't have. Thank you. It's very nice of you. There. Hairdresser didn't go easy on you, did he? - Not really. - You like it? Yes, I like short hair a lot. - Careful, it's gold. - Thanks. If anyone asks, tell them I gave it to you. OK. Thank you. There you are. - How do I look? - Good. It's pretty. - You think? - I thought you'd like it. Are you OK? I'll go... and have a look in the mirror. Mommy? Mommy! Mommy! Look at the number here. I want you. Reshmah's coming. She's here. - Is that you, Reshmah? - Yes. I'll be right there. Reshmah? - Alright? - Yes. Gérard and I are going to Grand-Goâve for lunch. Antoine's sleeping. Make him something when he wakes up. There's food in the kitchen. Are we having shrimp? No, lobster. You don't want lobster? - We'll stay home, then. - Meat would have been better. Do you like lobster? No? You could come with us. - Goodbye. - See you later. It's so hot, you've got to be kidding. I want to make it spin. Please, let me spin it. OK, here we are. Watch out. Right, I'll take care of this... Here we go. There. - Alright? - Yes. So, did you catch any fish? No, we didn't fish. We did. Oh, wow. Is this all you've caught, then? There's an octopus, too. - An octopus? - Yes. Did you catch that, the octopus? We have to take the engine out. Vroom, vroom! - We have to row. - No, we don't! I'm going to fall. Up, here we go. You've put your Sunday best on. - Is there a party? - No. - Why are you wearing it, then? - To look pretty. Oh, to look pretty. For whom? - Just for the house. - Really? You want to open the wine? No? Does he have to water while we're eating? - That's what gardeners do. - Oh, yeah? - Does he water under your skirt? - I don't know. Maybe. Just like the other one. I can see what he's up to. Antoine loves playing with him. - Not like with his father. - Perhaps it's more fun. Can you fill my bucket with water to clean the boat? Thank you. See, sometimes I surprise you... Did you see that? You did it first. This is good, isn't it, Bernard? I almost fell again. Can you... Can you put some water in my bucket? Right. - This is nice. - Is it? This is nice... It's nice. There you go. Wait a second. I want you to show me where the little one is. Sure. Nipal. Nipal, I'm hungry. Hey, Nouné, what are you doing? I'm feeding him leaves. - Are you hungry? - Yes. - Are you still hungry? - No, I'm full. Hey, Nouné... Nouné! I'm here. We're going fishing. He doesn't care. He's not interested in me. Nouné! What are you doing? What? Don't you care about Dad anymore? Don't you? Fine, keep him. I'll send you to boarding school. I'll take off your vest. I'll do it, I'll do it. There we go... Great. Let's go. It stings, you know. Really? It stings? Not anymore. - What are you doing up? - I can't sleep. - Why can't you sleep, sweetie? - I'm scared. You're scared of Bobodi? What is he gonna do? You think he's out there? - Yes. - No... Where do you see him? He turned... He turned into a plant. Oh, you think... You think that's him? It's him. - Is he moving? - Yes. Let's take a look at him. Listen to that. He's scared. He's so scared... What is it? Look. What do you think it is? It's right there. Give me that. Give it to me. Hello? Who are you calling? Is that all you have to say to me? You think this is a good time? Is that all you have to say? Stop it. I don't want to. Stop pulling at me. - I'm gonna leave. - Fine, leave. I mean I'm going back to Paris. Great. Go away for good. Come here. Easy... Easy... Come here. Come here. Why are you such an idiot? Maybe because I'm with you. There are lots of good reasons. You're a complete idiot. Get out of here. I've had enough now. Stop it, I'm tired. Stop it, stop! If you could just be tired of your stupidity... Get out! That's right. You're just not made for love. Shut up! Shut the hell up and leave! Get out now. Get out! You're too big to push out. You're a big, fat burden. I can't do this anymore. - Go away. - Stop that. - Go away! - Give me a break. Stop hesitating. You come and go, and come and go... - Just go. - I'll go when I feel like it. You can't always do what you want. I should have left long ago, I'm done. Why do I always get into stuff like this? - Mommy, come here. - I'm coming. Go back up there. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go for a swim. Will you take this off? Yes, I'll take it off. Of course I'll take it off. Come on, let's jump. No, not like that. Up you go. - Stay here. - Minibee... Mini... - Stay here. - I'll show you how it's done. Like this. Can you be quiet for a minute, Antoine? - OK, stop now. - I'm flying! Yes, you're flying. That's enough, now. Hi! The red one. - Give me the red one. - Wait, here it is. This here. Yeah, I'm taking him. Come on, kiddo. Don't tell your mother, though. Come on, let's go. - Ready, darling? Off we go. - Yes! Goodbye. - Slowly, OK? - Yes, slowly. - You OK? - Yes. - Not too scared? - No. - Not too cold? - No. You can't tell Mommy about this, she'll give me hell. - Alright? - Yes. Not a word. Move! Robot number one. Go! - Robot? - Yes? Don't tell Mom. I don't want to get yelled at. Here we are. - What do we have here? - Ouch! You don't just let him go like that. Anyone could take him. - It's his father. I thought... - No, you call me first. But he looked so happy. I thought he would like it. I didn't want to ride on your bike. Mommy doesn't want you to. I'm going to tell Mommy that you don't have a scooter. Sweetheart, no... He's running away. Alright? So you brought him back? - Are you coming, Antoine? - I'm coming. Come on. - You brought him back. - On the bike, yes. Are you feeling better? Come, take a look at this. Check this out. Look at this. - I'll make you some juice. - Great. No! I said no! You don't want juice? He wants to ride the bike. No, we've just arrived. We'll see what we can do. Don't ever do that again. Come on, we're going home. Don't run away. - We're going home. - No! What's the matter? Antoine, stop. See the state he's in now? You just randomly pick him up? Come on, let's go. Enough of this nonsense. You call me and ask me. - See the state he's in now? - He was very happy. He's doing fine. It's alright. What's going on? Nothing, just a kidnapping. He was happy just now. I got him on the bike, and now look. Why is he crying? I picked him up from school by bike earlier on and now his mother makes a scene. - I kidnapped him. - Not really. That's what I say. Bye, Thérèse. Why are you doing the dishes? I did your dishes for 15 years. You can sleep here. Why the hell did you let her have your apartment? - My son needs it. - You've never cared for him. Exactly. He needs that. If it bothers you that much, you can leave. This place cost me twice the price of the other one! Damn it. What are you doing here? You stink! You smell of men. I don't know how he puts up with you. You're nothing but a whore. You like men, don't you? Yes, you do. And he just lies there, reading his paper. You disgust me. I'm out. Fucking bastard. What a jerk. - Are you keeping this house? - No. The rooms are tiny. I'd like a well-kept house. - Nicely decorated. - Meh. You used to have one. Your skin is a bit too pale. You don't like it? I do. What I do regret is not getting laid more. - No feelings involved. - No. Just fuck, fuck, fuck... - What? - That's right. Tic, tic, tic... Tic, tic, tic... I'm not laughing. I am, which is quite something. Tic, tic, tic... - Gérard? - What? I'm coming. God, it hurts! I'm dying! Here, have some more. The rise of the dead. Stop it, you're scaring me. - Gérard? - I told you, it's afterwards. It hurts. What would you do if I died? I don't know. I think I'd... What'd you do? Would you just leave me? - I wouldn't believe it at first. - How's that? You'd believe it at the end? - Do you have those in my size? - I'll check inside. You do that. You're not here by chance, are you? Come on. Let's pick him up. No, wait, I am buying shoes. I'll go with you. You coming? - Hi, Nouné. - How are you? Daddy's here too. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Don't forget your puppet, Antoine. Hold on, I'll take it. - Which one is it? - There you go. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Antoine. Bye-bye. Let's put your coat on. Put him down. I can't hold everything - the puppet, the coat. There you are, darling. Put his hat on. There you are. Give him the puppet. How are you? Are you carrying him? - It's broken. - We'll fix it. Let me see. Fix it, please. Here, give me the puppet. I'm gonna fix it for you. Did you have a good day, Nouné? How are you feeling? You look tired. Let's get going. Get in the car. I don't like him sitting in the front. Put him in the back. Get in the back with him. We're sitting in the back because that's what Daddy wants. Here we go... Watch your head. You're gone, but you're here. It's unbearable. I love you. You don't love when you're gone. I've suffered too much. And me? You think I haven't suffered? Nouné, come here. Come here, little man. I'm here. He's amazing. - You're not listening. - Sure I am. Look. He's really... a little devil. Where'd he get that from? Well... Antinea! Antinea! I want to see her. Antinea! No! Antinea! Who is Antinea? Antinea... Antinea... Paris! Paris! - Come on. - What? Come on, let's see how you dance. The leg. You have to lift your leg. Do it with me. Put me down, I don't like this. - You don't like this? - No. - Where is my son? - He's with Sandrine. - I don't trust her. - He's fine. What if something happens to him? Let's finish with the lumbar vertebrae, left to right. From left to right. Now we'll go up and down. Go ahead... very well. Up and down. Gently... that's it. Also move back and forth to vary the pressure. Go on, very well. Not too quickly, though. That's it. Very good. I'm sorry to say that's the end of the session. Have a nice day. Thank you. What did Grandpa say? Something nasty... Ah, there you are. Please... have a seat. So, you had dessert and straight to boogie! You've had your boogie. What are you drinking? - I don't know... - What do you want to drink? - Same as you. - Red wine? - Sure. - A little glass, then. Thanks. - Your friends are on fire. - They're pretty good dancers, eh? Are they doctors? Drug representatives? - They're doing this... - This what? It's like French cancan, you know, the dance... First you need to know what motherhood is about. I don't feel that urge. I don't feel like having a child just yet. Meeting someone, having babies... No, I'd rather dance. Careful, you might get pregnant. - I bet she dances well. - Huh? I bet she's a good dancer. She's full of energy. They all wear black stockings, it's annoying. It would be better if they wore no stockings at all. That girl in the polka-dot dress. She dances like she's making love. It's a rabbit convention. Look at all the guys in suits. They have to be doctors, or... I reckon they'll be having some anatomy lessons tonight. - It's gonna bang. - Yeah, you're right. This place is like every other place. Look, it's late, the dudes are drunk, they're all hot and bothered. It's a well-known fact in this job and any other job, for that matter. - I'm off. - Stay a bit. No, I'm tired. Look, Jean is here. Come on, stay with us. No, I'm going to bed. Why, are you upset? I'm not upset, I'm bored. Have you seen the way she dresses? Unbelievable. - Why did she go? - She says she's tired. I don't know why she wears massive pants, with that killer body. I mean, look at them. They know what they want. Look at those moves... They're pretty hot, actually. They're happy, you see. They're feeling good. Oh, dear... So they're all drug reps? I think so. They're tall, they're beautiful... Models shacked up with doctors. - It's a tough job. - You think? I wouldn't mind being a doctor. Have you ever wanted to be a gynecologist? A gynecologist? No. - Why not? - I don't know. Looking at those girls there... I wouldn't like it that much. - A surgeon maybe. - Surgeon? Nice. Why does she dress like a hobo when she's with me? Well, well... I'm going to bed. What? What did you say? I'm off, I'm beat. - Why? - You didn't dance, but I did. - I'm going, too. - I'll go with you. - Where's my bag? - Wait, here it is. - You're leaving? - Yes, I'm gonna walk her home. - There are bastards out there. - Good night. Come on. Let's go. Are you walking me because you don't want to go back to your wife? - No? - And you? Have you split up with that monster? I knew all about him before I met him. He said he used to beat his wife. So you went to see for yourself? Everything was fine at first. First time he tried, I left him. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. So there... He was an idiot, but still, I couldn't hate him. You know, there are worse people. What I don't like is hypocrisy. - Hypocrisy? - Yeah, I can't stand it. You were lucky. - You think so? - Of course. Well, I dodged that bullet. What are you up to now? I'm taking care of myself, that's all. - I'm doing... - You're doing what? I go to museums and to the gym... - The gym? - Yes. What do you do there? - Same as everybody else. - You do squats? Are you waking them up? No, I have the key. I don't know if it's the right one. Leave it. You're shaking from the cold. - From the cold. - Yes. I can't... Give me that. Give me the key. It's stiff. It won't turn. Let's go through the parking lot. Come on. - What parking lot? - There. Crap, they've changed the system. They've changed the system. Gérard, put your hand on my ass. Touch my ass, Gérard. Yes, come on... Hold me tight. Put your hand on my ass. - Give me your mouth. - No. - I'm not like Sophie, eh? - Sophie? I could see you wanted to leave. And find a cab at 2 a.m. in the middle of nowhere? Come on. Oh, fuck. You can't walk down here, people. We're not doing anything wrong. Hello? For a luxury hotel, the soundproofing is really under par. How long is this hullabaloo going on for? A little bit? Anything wrong? Not only am I awake at 3 a.m., which is no fun, but I'll also have to hear you snore till 5 a.m., so, yeah. I'm not snoring. I wasn't sleeping. I've already told you that people can snore even when they're not sleeping. Are you listening? You were snoring. - You snore. - But I wasn't sleeping. I just said that you can snore even when you're not sleeping. - Now I'm completely awake. - That's good. Ouch, that hurts. Come on, let's play trains. I don't want to play trains. Look. Here are your shoes... You have to pull me. You're the train, I'm the passenger. Come on, let's go. Come on. I want to go somewhere sunny... the French Riviera. I'm waiting for the train. Come on, I'm in the sleeping compartment. You're the sleeper train, are you ready? Great, there's no one here. Shall we sit there? So, where was I? It was the middle of July, I was at the beach with a friend... We had some white wine, lukewarm, but still very good, and the oysters... - Hi. - Why don't you sit here? - Hey, Cathy. - Thank you. - Let's order some water. - There's no rush. For once, let's not chuck drinks down our throats and eat like crazy. We can take our time. Alright, Cathy? You look a bit sad. Should we sit by the window? - Good idea. - OK, great. It's a little bit dark here. Come on. We're taking this table. I'll just move the flowers. I know you don't like them. I've never seen a woman's bag so neat and tidy. See the bag, know the woman. You just don't get it, don't you? You know I don't like it when it gets dark. It gives me the blues, but you've never cared. Now all your attention goes to some bitch who doesn't give a damn. You're such a pain. Oh no, Cathy, stay. It's nothing. No, it's not. You don't have to go. Goodbye. Have you ever wondered if you make me happy? - Of course not. - You're a pain in the ass. You think I'm happy? Are we happy together, Jean? Crazy love, passion and all that is long gone. As soon as the woman gets pregnant, it all vanishes. Charming. Look ahead, kids. Don't talk like that, Sofiane. Let's keep moving. We're almost there. Excuse me sir, who are you? I was just passing... It's Big Gégé! I see, but... It's alright, Marianne. The gentleman is his father. - Goodbye, sweetheart. - We're going in now, sir. Bye, Daddy. Bye, darling. Nouné! Mommy's picking you up today. Alright, darling? I love you. Bye, Nouné. Bye-bye. Bye, Daddy. Tété! Dinner's ready! Ouch, my ears! Give me one more shrimp. No, this shrimp is for Mommy. He hasn't done that since... Well, since the last time you left. What do you think? He's like that because of Jean. He's all excited because you're here. Hold on. Here, darling. Here, open your mouth. - Wait, I'll take it. - Go ahead. You have to pull. You have to pull while I'm eating. OK, come on. Daddy's food... Right, let's do it. There. - What? - It's working. This thing's annoying. - Do you like TV? - Yes. You don't like TV, you like cassettes. But that's not TV. Look, I don't know how this works. - Don't get mad. - I'm not mad at you, darling. I'm not mad at you. We can play trains. I'm not mad at you, OK? Here, look. Let's play with this here. Let's play. I want to play with this. Did you know Micheline sneaked in the daycare to see Antoine? She told me earlier. - They let her in? - Yes. I don't think she saw him, though. They were in the park. And the best thing is, she's rewritten her will in favor of him. What? She's included Antoine in her will. You don't say! He's going to be rich. That's it? That's all you have to say? Well, he'll be able to buy himself a super apartment in a fancy area. - Is there any wine? - In the fridge. - In the fridge. - Are you nuts? It'll ruin it. It will ruin the wine. Well, I'm sorry. Good Lord... Time flies. It stinks in your fridge. Seriously. You could come every so often to stock the fridge. You'd have everything you need. Can I have a glass? It's in the usual place. Think you have enough canned food in there? That's too much canned food. No, not really. Can I have a light, please? You smoke? In here? Every now and then. Yeah, well... Do you make soup for the kid? I don't want him eating any old... Can I still touch you? What is this doing here? I put it there. Little man. Antoine used to play with it all the time, and... I was worried he'd break it, so I put it away. There's the other one, too. The little boat. I used to... make fun of people who tuck in their children at night. Because children throw off the covers. I did that until the day... I started doing it all the time. He was always pushing his covers off. It's not like you to say these things. I think those were the happiest moments of my life. You were so late the night I gave birth... You left me alone all morning with my mother. You never took pictures of me pregnant. You were always saying you'd do it, but you never did. No, I didn't, because... Well, first because... I love you so much. It's intimidating. What about the other one? I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I've nothing to say about him, he's nice. I prefer someone I like, you know, because... Having to deal with his presence, his being here... Good God, that's just... That's what hurts the most, you see. In the morning, my little darling is probably like, "Hello, Mom", "Hello, sir". Yes. Precisely. That's not how it is. I've no idea how it is, that's just how I see it. Maybe I should have... But I don't know how to take pictures. He probably does. Me, on the other hand... It's not fair, he loves me exactly as I wanted you to love me and... And...? That's it. That explains everything. Love, you say. What's love to you? Why can't I walk faster? You have to be careful when you're not holding my hand. There. Watch your fingers. Come on. Hi, Micheline. - Alright? - How are you? - Where are you going? - Shopping. - Do you want to come? - Sure. OK, here we are. I'm wiping my feet. Hold on. I'll close the door. Why did you put my coat back on in the elevator? I'm just having a quick beer. Help yourself. Help myself to what? You want something to drink too? I'm sorry to say this, but... He's never loved anyone like he loves Antoine. He can't love him, he's never around. I can tell he loved you when you were young. It's obvious. I guess. He loved his father in his own way. How're you doing? No, I don't know... I don't know if I'll make it. Micheline's here right now. She came to see Antoine. Give me a minute, I'll call you back. Don't go, Micheline. I'm not leaving yet. I'll call you in a moment, OK? We have to get those cream shoes. We get the cream shoes, and then... Do you want to play pinball first? No, first... First, I want us to go to the... - You want to buy the shoes? - Yes, the cream shoes. First, we get the shoes. - What are those shoes like? - They're cream. They're cream and I want to buy those shoes. The big ones you showed me? No, the little ones. I want little... no, I want big cream shoes, and then it will be fine. I saw them in the apartment. Let's go play pinball, then. - What do you want to do? - Video games. Because there is a man who wants to play. - We'll do both. - No. - There's a man who wants to play. - He'll let you play. No, it's that way. That way. We'll go this way first, and then we'll buy the shoes. Alright? Good? Yes... but no. First I would like to buy the shoes. Come on, let's go. Let's go say hi to Sylvie. - There it is. - Is it broken? That one's broken. Come on, let's play pinball. Thanks for the... Wait, I'll take a chair. Because I'm little. You do know I'm little. Let's insert a coin. No, I'll do it, I'll put two in. - No. - You want two? No, four. - I'm playing with you. - Yes. Come on. - Do you want another ball? - Yes, please. There you go... Wait. You have to let it go to win more balls, otherwise, you lose. See, this is... What's wrong with this flipper? Look! There you go. Oh, look. - Oh, hi! - Who is it? - Alright? - Great. Keep playing, Antoine. Come on! I'll play with you later. You keep going. - What are you having? - Coffee. Let me tell you, I have lost. - Doing good? - Yes. - He's happy. - He skipped school. Oh, yeah? What about you? I'm not working right now. I'm available. He's better here with me than he is at daycare, right? - Yes. Mind you, daycare's not bad either. And Sophie? - Sophie? - How is she? She's home. I can't do both. There, I got one. Did you have a good night? - Yeah. - You did? I mean, I slept a bit. I hardly sleep at night. You don't sleep? You're tired. Too much work. It's quite the opposite for me. Exactly. You think too much when you don't work enough. I've won! - He loves pinball. - He won. I've lost. - You've lost? - I've lost again. Here, you have one ball left. Can I shoot? No, I shoot. Can you leave me alone, please? Are you playing alone? Can I stand here? No, that's where he stands. - What about me? - Take this side, Gérard. There. Right... You can have some coffee. Go get some coffee, Gérard. Hold on... There you go. OK, ready... Look. - I'm leaving. - Goodbye. Bye, Jean. You're going? - I am. Bye-bye. - Bye. Look, something happened. It tilted. But that's wrong, it didn't have to tilt... Bye, sweetie. Bye. Come on, come on! Don't worry, this one will come up, too. What? Antoine! You have to press. Very good. Wait! You have to... - We have to take this off first. - Take it off. Come on! Careful. Get in, you'll see. The forward gear is right here. OK, hold on... Look at this. Forward gear... Here. Careful, now. Turn slowly. Start moving... now press this. We've got an accident! Leave it open. Here's "forward". - Won't you help him? - Sure. That's funny. Can you put the door on, please? - Can you let me do it? - Well, do. All I hear is complaints. You wrecked my son's truck. - Big Gégé... - Yes, darling. Drive me around. Go! Look at that. Shoot, we busted a wheel. Start the engine, we don't have all day. Hold on! Now go. Come here. - OK? - What are you talking about? Give me a kiss. Can you move over? If I drive, I'm going to run you over. Come, darling. Give me a kiss. Why are you sweating? Because I carried the truck all the way up here and then we went for a ride. - Is it too hot? - It's too heavy, I'd say. - He's overexcited. - Because a broken truck is a pain. You know what I wanted to do, little man? I wanted us to go out for dinner. But I already ate. He was sleeping. And now he has a truck. He could have taken us in his truck to dinner. But I can't because... - Goodbye, sweetie. - Bye. - Hello, Gérard. How's it going? - I'm fine. - Hello, Janine. - How are you? Oh, I'm alright. - I'll have some ham. - Make yourself comfortable. Just a drop. - OK, stop. - That's it? When was the last time that Sophie came to see you? That was a while ago. How long? I don't know. About a week, maybe. Sorry, I... Janine, could you please give me a little... So I can put the... - No problem. Here it is. - Great. This... and this here. Thank you. - Did she come with... - Yes. ...with him? I'd never seen him before. Oh, OK. Was he nice to the little one? From what I saw, yes. There's no way to know. Antoine is still unruly? Well, in that sense... Nothing has changed. It's only natural. Excuse me. Go ahead. - I'm in the way. - Of course not. Nothing to worry about, you're thin. I could use a beer. Men have bad breath after they drink beer. Have a gin. You smelled of gin when you first kissed me. I like gin. This was taken last week. You're leading a double life. Hello? Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. When are you leaving? I'm in. Gérard's father is ill. - Are you upset? - Well, yes. - How will you get there? - Driving. - Flying's better. - I hate it. Plus, I don't want him to drive all alone. Alright? Can you... Wait. Here. He can't eat. He throws up everything, even liquids. Yes, he's completely dehydrated. You're not looking after him. I'll take him to Ambert. They'll put him on a drip. We're taking you to Ambert. We'll get you out of here. Good. It's for you, sir. Someone wants to talk to you. Hello? Come with me, I'll walk you. He didn't suffer. He passed in his sleep. You've been a good son. All that hill, everything you see there was ours. It was "the wood of the fleet". The trunks were so straight, they were used to make ship masts. While on an expedition to the Giroux station one day, the garçu's father died, along with his helper. In fact, the garçu held his mother responsible... ...for his father's death. They drove to the station after a very heated argument, but then one of the straps got detached, and... The logs shifted, the helper was killed... He had nothing but a tiny scratch here, but he was killed instantly. The water's not moving and yet there's a current. Yesterday, we were alive, he and I. In the end, I never got to know my homeland. I'll never come back. "Teuchi, le garçu". "Le garçon", the boy. No. I've always called my father the garçu, ever since the day we were down there catching crawfish, my father and I, and you showed up saying, "What are you doing here?" I remember he answered, "I'm the garçu from Cunlhat." And then you said, "Teuchi, le garçu." That's how it went. I've always called him the garçu. The pronunciation changes. See that taxi there? He also uses it as a hearse. On the threshold of His house Our father is waiting And the arms of God Will open for you When the doors... Do you have anything other than plastic? That's on the client's request. On the threshold of His house... I didn't... I could have... I could have taken something of his. When the last day comes As the Lord calls you You will rise up and walk... Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. - Back in town? - Oh, certainly not. Too ugly, too many pine trees. There's nothing left. - What's new? - We're leaving. - Already? - Indeed. Is there any way you can stay for a moment? We can't, because... - Goodbye. - Why don't you come in? - Have lunch with us. - I can't, but I'll come back. That's what you say, but you never stay. We'll give you a call first, OK? - Safe journey, then. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Sophie. Give our love to your son. See you soon. - Bye now. - Don't forget to call. - Goodbye. - Bye. Call me tonight if you'd like to come for a drink... Bye. - Hi, Thérèse. - Hello. - Anything for me? - Nothing. - Come on. - I want... Take your coat off. You're not going out, are you crazy? Calm down, Nouné. Go to your room. He's a pain. Always whining. You didn't wait for him, he doesn't understand. Also, I haven't dealt with overload in ten years. What's the real reason? Tell me. Three days. Three days without news. I told you where I was and with whom. It's not that hard! I'm not a dog, damn it. - Like this? - Yes. Press on the frog if you want to change colors. - So... - Want a piece of paper? I'm writing a note. Wait, don't write on the book. - Where can I... - Here's a notebook. - You can write on it. - A notebook. It's not working. Press harder. Try it on your shoe sole. That's not a very good idea because... - I know. - But it's cool. Can you write my name on the shoes? Both of them. - No, here. - On the canvas? - No, not on the canvas. - Why not? You can't tell everybody they're yours. It's a secret between you and me. A... We need an A. So, A... N... T... O... and then comes I, N and E. OK, give it to me. No-one will steal them from you at daycare. You'll say, "These are mine". Let's put these on the table. - Is it already paid for? - You have to sign. Here, please. How come the door's open? - Thanks, bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hi. Goodbye. Don't leave the door open. You never know. Oh, wow. I'm not sure about this. You gotta go easy on chocolate. It's not like... When will she be back? Any minute now. Right. You have an afternoon snack every day? Not every day. - It reminds you of your childhood? - My teeth hurt. I'll give you my dentist's number. He's good. - Call him. - I don't like dentists. Rotten teeth give you terrible breath, you know. Quit it, Gérard. Ah, there she is. Go and have your teeth checked. Otherwise it'll be too late, they'll start coming out. I have to go. Pop in, pop out. I haven't seen you in ages. Yes, I've been busy. You could check in from time to time. - Were you worried about me? - No news is good news. Fantastic! Now that's really... Where's Antoine? He's at Charles' for a sleepover. He's gonna stay glued to the TV, like all kids nowadays. He'll turn into a piece of bacon. - When's he coming back? - Tomorrow morning. Where does Charles live? - Nearby. - Is there a balcony? He lives on the ground floor. The ground floor? I don't like that. - He's grown up a lot, you know. - Well, that's... He's not getting any smaller. He's going to school next year. No more daycare. Why is that? I've no choice. School spoils everything, if you ask me. It's a special school. They only have classes in the morning. So you take him in the morning, pick him up at noon... Remember Montreuil? All those crazy mothers... You've got such a big mouth. You'd make a perfect politician. You speak of Antoine... Do you look after him? Take an interest in him? Have you ever watched him without talking? With him, and more importantly, for him? Listen... I do what I can, Jean. I'm snowed under with work right now, I should take advantage of it. There's one thing I can tell you, though - I am certain that Antoine knows that I am his father. That's for sure. - OK, I'm off. - Where to? - I'm on a big project. - Really? A Cnemis village. A duffel town. In Cyprus. Oh, I have to write you a check. You look handsome in that suit. It's a business thing, you know what I mean? You should wear it more often. I only ride bikes in Paris, I can't always wear suits. Right, this is for Isabelle. You fill it out. Also, you're gorgeous. What's the secret? Is it the 5 p.m. snacks that got him into shape? I'm sorry. You look tired, though. I'm tired? OK, if you say so. - Do I look tired? - No, you look good. Alright, sweetheart. - Bye. - Keep us posted! See you. - Don't leave us hanging. - I won't, don't worry. - Alright, bye now. - Bye. That was quick. I hope he didn't mess with you. No. Gérard's a nice guy. You made all that for yourself? Yes. I'm not having dinner tonight. Now you can get off the train. Alright, let's take this... Let's wake up the wolves! Stay on this side, kids. Alexina and Margot, come here a second. Antoine... You can play on this lawn here only, and all around this path. We're going to bring the tricycles. Please don't go down there. Yes, we're bringing them now. Antoine! Antoine! Stay on this side, kids! Over here, please. You can't go there, Sofiane. My little bunny is very sad He no longer eats or hops in his little garden Hop, hop, hop, my little bunny And quickly kiss Someone you love well Come on, little bunny. Are you going to kiss someone? - Yes. - OK, go ahead. A boy? As you wish. A boy or a girl. Christopher, your turn. Antoine, stand between Maximilien and Sofiane. OK, Christopher, you're the little bunny. My little bunny is very sad He no longer eats or hops in his little garden - Hold each other's hand. - Are you ready? Shall we sing? The train's running off its rails. Choo-choo, little train Here it comes, little train Pulling its wagons And whistling a song Oh, what luck What a beautiful trip Oh, what luck Choo-choo... Antoine, please, we're almost there. I know you're tired, you've played a lot. - Let's do choo-choo. - Choo-choo! Listen up, how am I going to drive this train if I don't have proper assistants? Don't do that. Choo-choo, little train Here it comes, little train Pulling its wagons And whistling a song Oh, what luck What a beautiful trip Oh, what luck It's going to the park Get in. How are you? Why don't you drive? Because I don't know where we're going. - The Japanese place? - No. Not the Japanese place because they're not happy, so... They don't want you there either. Japanese poison Mom and Dad. We're going to Philippe's. I don't want to go there. Because... because... because you bug me when I'm on the stool. You always bug me. I don't want to. We're gonna go to Philippe's and eat some shrimp. We can go for a ride if you want. - Alright. - Let's go! We could go to that little garden I haven't been to. - If you want. - OK, we're going there. Thank you. Thank you, Sophie. I'll take the bill. I was watching you walk. And? I like coming here. The food is good. But you don't care for food. Your affection for my father... You love other people's families because you didn't have grandparents. Grandparents are important. When you had none... you can feel the absence. How do I look in this suit? You look great. - Are you kidding me? - No. - It looks good on you. - Look. I don't know. The pants don't fit well, they get stuck in my... - There's a plate missing. - I got it! OK, we're good, then. Put it here and watch out. Give me one of Philippe's fingers. Give me Philippe's finger or some ham. That's too little, sweetie. - We'll cut a slice for you. - What is this? We'll cut you a big one. You're going to get cut. Hey, your slices are too thin! - Me want big ham. - Go ahead. Let's see. He got a big one. Ham is good. You give me shit about balconies but you're not afraid he'll get cut. When I say "more", you slice one more. You're gonna eat all the ham! It's OK, Philippe's with him. He knows what he's doing. And for the record, he's just picking up the slices. I know, but... I tried it, it's good. Go on, one more. - Another slice? - Yes. This one's nice. Not bad at all. OK, one more. Look, there's Gérard. Give him one more piece. A little one... There you go. He's eating! - He's having a hard time. - Yes, he is. That's it? - What do we do? - One more. Wait, let's turn it off. We'll turn it back on afterwards.
