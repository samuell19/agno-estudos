(light music) (birds chirping) - [Voice-over] (mumbles) most about that? - Not the people. - [Voice-over] Right. - No. I'll (mumbles) I'll miss everything. But I had everything so I can't feel too terrible about missing something that I had for so long. - [Voice-over] Wonderful. - [Voice-over] Well you know what? I think I have a broken heart, so how do I not have a broken heart? Well I'm telling you this, if I knew this kid, Harvey West would’ve loved California 100 years ago. (light music) they say Harvey West would love California 100 years ago. - [Voice-over] I am an actress. - [Voice-over] Do they know each other? Harvey. - [Voice-over] I am an actress. - [Voice-over] Harvey West would have loved California 100 years ago. - [Voice-over] I'm an actress. - [Voice-over] Colleen West never liked the first light of day. It made her nervous and desperate for night. Colleen met Harvey two months ago during a production of Star Witness. A play in which they both acted. To have the same last name, it meant something to both of them. It was their first connection, and as time passed, Colleen wondered if it was their only real connection. And the silence, silence. Of you. - [Voice-over] Please make it stop. (unintelligible talking) anytime? How are you? How are you? How are you? - [Voice-over] This is the hardest part this is the hardest part - [Voice-over] Things become so clear. Have you ever stared in a mirror for too long? To a point where you become disgusted with yourself? I once looked into a boy's eyes and felt that way. He had eyes like a deer. He would look away and it would only get worse. Sorry I lost... Why does he look away? (screeching) a shit year. One. Two. Three. This must be what (mumbles). (dinging) (light music) (humming) - [Voice-over] Can you believe that I'm retiring? Can you believe that I'm... - [Voice-over] Colleen West. I think I could look at your face for 1000 years. (laughter) - I'm happy. - [Voice-over] You're happy. It hurts. - it hurts me too. - [Voice-over] He's so hurt why then don't you show it? - It hurts me too. (unintelligible talking) - did you want me to stay in there? - You know. The play, our play I can't believe its over. - It's always over. You get used to it. - Do you think I'm a good actor? (laughter) - what? - Do you think I can act? - I think you are full of many... Gifts. ♪ I don't wanna be mean ♪ But I'm not afraid ♪ Anything you steal ♪ Baby you'll pay for in spades ♪ Little girl in the running water ♪ Run Run shake me clean - I didn't expect you to use your tongue. - No? - No. (mumbles) ♪ Well I hate that window ♪ You don't come through no more ♪ Don't talk in your sleep ♪ Don't you leave a trace ♪ Cause a woman woman ♪ Can have the devil's face ♪ I don't wanna be mean - nope.

We understand you wish to make things right. Then we will help you make things right. - What kind of information do you need? - In order to provide the best simulation possible, we will need to know everything. - [Voice-over] Ask me anything. - Excellent. We need to collect a breathing sample. Will you be able to provide that? - A what? - We need to understand how he breathes. - I don't think I know how he breathes. - In order to provide the best simulation. - Okay, I just breathe like him. - If you're able. Will you place this under your tongue? - Are you recording this? - Was it accurate? If you question your ability to provide information, you should let us know, now. - You don't really think how someone breathes. - Maybe not, but we do. Can you please try again? I'll count to 10, please do not stop until I have completed my count. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. Hold still. Hold still. - [Voice-over] I'm happy. - [Voice-over] Do not close your mouth. - [Voice-over] I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy. (horn) (chirping) - Hey. What are you doing? - The horn wouldn't stop. - Its' fine now. - Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it? You sure? (blaring horn) they don't understand our relationship. - What's our relationship? - You tell me. - What? - Do you think it's shit? - Hi. You hear the birds this morning? - Have a nice day. - [Voice-over] The birds have been going off. - I only hear machines. - Yeah man what are they building over there? - Maybe birdhouses. - Right. Did you just move? - Sorry. - I haven't seen you, I live just down the road with my husband. - That's great. I live over here. - Oh I didn't know anyone really lived over there. - I do. Now. Very tired. - Oh. What from? - I was with the circus. - Really? Wow. - Wow. - What was your talent? - Well I walked on ropes, I ate fire, and I was able to speak to animals in their native animal tongue. - Wow. Really? - Really, wow. - Must have been hard to leave something like that. It becomes like your family doesn't it? - Well you know I slept with two of the clowns and they were brothers. Caused an enormous amount of grief for everybody, we all felt it was time for me to go. - Oh. - Yeah all I want is... (mumbles) - yeah me too. I mean that's why James and I moved down here. - We have so much in common. - Oh yeah? Do you jog? - No no. Circus injury so no. - Well you should really come over some time, James loves interesting people. - Really, me too. When I get one I'll be sure to bring him over. - Oh, well... Okay great. I'm gonna finish my run. - Sounds wonderful. (singing) - [Voice-over] Bet you get sick of that. - Okay is that enough? - No. - All right all right. - No. You're not wet. - Okay. Gross. - Come back from the light. (mumbles) - all right that's enough. - Yeah. Hold still. - Thanks for the ride. - Yeah well I heard it was gonna rain. - Riding a bike in the rain sucks. - It sucks. - True. - So tonight's your first dress rehearsal. - Yeah. - Are you nervous? - Horribly. - [Voice-over] You'll be great. (mumbles) (mumbles) - your house, it's so dark. - Yeah. People came and they took the windows away. - Yeah? - Yeah, took away the light, only took them a few hours. Dear darkness. - You don't feel trapped? - By what? - The darkness. - It's better than being exposed. - Yeah I guess so. - People they provide too much light. - I want you to hit me. In the face. - (mumbles) - we're fucking. - [Voice-over] Miss West can you give us a sound check please? - Sure, one two three four five six seven eight nine. - You know it really is an honor having you here. - Thank you (mumbles). I'm very happy to be here. - It's funny that this might very well be your last interview ever. - Could be. - Kinda like the end of everything and the start of nothing right? - Looks cold. - Well it was. (mumbles) - I'm fine right here. - You sure? (mumbles) it's freezing. - What do you want to be when you grow up Harvey West? - Well Miss West, I don't know. Maybe some guesses. - You could be an explorer. - (mumbles) explorer. - Life would be low. Underwater. You're a natural in there. - What about sharks? - What about them? (unintelligible talking) - I am afraid of.. - What? - I don't know anymore. - How can you not know what you're afraid of? - I don't know. Maybe as you get older... - Come on tell me. - Forget it. - No tell me. - I'd fear the end of loss. Kiss me. - Right here? - So is this the beginning of the end? - Beginning of the end? - Beginning of the end. - What do you mean? - I don't know our play's over and I'm retiring. Who knows where you're going. Away from me. That's okay if this is the beginning of the end. Kiss me (mumbles) - all right. I don't know. - Something's waiting for you out there and it sure isn't me. Am I wrong? - [Voice-over] I don't know. - You don't know. You know you're not allowed to say that anymore. - [Voice-over] We have everything prepared. Unfortunately it's not quite what we told you it would be. If do not wear the mask, his face will not appear to you. - Do you hate me? - I can't hate you. - Oh, good. - I just want to make things right. - Are things wrong? - I haven't heard from you in.. I miss you. - I've been busy. - Have you? - Busy is good. This mask is so uncomfortable. - It's state of the art. - Is it? - Much time has gone into it. - Yeah? Did you help? - Do you hate me? - I... How long are you gonna be here with me? - I don't know, is there a window? - Window? - Of time. - I don't know. Windows are awful. - But am I supposed to be here? - What? - Do you want me here? - Yes. - Yes? - You don't seem like you. - What do I seem like? - You seem like a shadow. - [Voice-over] It's the light, the light is different here, I am different in this light. - [Voice-over] No. - [Voice-over] Its the light. - [Voice-over] No it's not the light. - [Voice-over] The light is different here I am different in this light. It's the light. The light is different here I am different. - [Voice-over] I can't wear this thing. (mumbles) (heavy breathing) - [Voice-over] It's the light. The light is different. I am different in this light. (screaming) - [Voice-over] No, no. (crying) (wind chimes) - you're happy. This hurts. - [Voice-over] It hurts me too. - If you're so hurt why don't you show it? - [Voice-over] It hurts me too. - You know few actresses ever really retire completely. Can you confirm that this is the real deal? - Yeah this is it. The real deal. I absolute hate those words together. But for the sake of your show I will allow it. - Thank you. Are the parts simply not what they used to be? - Well you know as an actor, when the writing is poor, you make it interesting. That's something i learned a long time ago. I considered writing a piece for myself once, but... - What sort of themes or... - Completion. - Completion. - Yeah. - Thank you so much for coming down. - Oh my pleasure. - Will you be staying in the area? - Los Angeles, no. No my house just sold I'm moving into a cabin I own. - A cabin? - Yeah I've owned it for years. Somebody told me to buy it so I did. We know who that person was. - Is it in the general area? - Miss West, sorry, this came for you earlier. - One last fan letter? - It's from my agent. - Oh maybe they want you back. - [Voice-over] Dear Colleen, it's been an amazing adventure, good luck with your retirement. We went ahead and donated six world globes to the alternative academy in Avalon. Enclosed you'll find a letter from one of the students, thanking you for your gift. Keep in touch, Adam. - [Voice-over] Dear Miss West, thank you so much for the gloves. We can now spend hours dreaming of going to places that we'll never get to go to. One of the globes is broken, it probably happened during shipping or something. It's okay though, because we use that one to play with when we're bored. Have a great day, Marcus. (horn) - [Voice-over] Four, five, six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. - [Voice-over] The newly retired bring in wealth, and also jobs as they get older, and need help at home. Perhaps (mumbles) calls into the joys and properties speculation. And will throw away society. Kathy Flower. Peasant world with lessons from the past for us all, perhaps. But I have to say I think I'd be completely hopeless and any sort of wild asparagus. I don't know where to begin. How do you catch them I wonder.

It's the second part of the morning. I guess I must have missed the first. - Right. - So? - I have something for you. It's an antique. - Is it a doll or a friend? - Well both I guess I mean it's yours now so... - I'll have to add it to my doll collection. - Do you have a... - I've been meaning to start one. A doll collection. I guess I forgot. I think it was my terrible childhood. - Yeah? Well have you ever heard of apple dolls? I'm gonna be making one this weekend if you want to come over and help. Or even make one for yourself. - I'm not familiar with apple dolls. - No? You seem so craft friendly. - Cat friendly? - Craft, like arts and crafts. - Oh no. I'm not. Friendly in that way. - Well. - Listen... - Shelly. - Shelly. Tell me something. Have you been sleeping? - What do you mean? - Well, I haven't been sleeping very well. And I don't know maybe it's like all that nature. Or maybe there's something in the woods. - Okay. Well you'll let me know about the apple dolls? - All right. - Bye. - It's a doll made out of an apple. An apple. Yeah isn't that great? Great, that is fantastic. Yeah. I once tried to make a doll out of a grape. But it just didn't work out. Those would have been some tiny dolls. Oh yeah, but everybody loves tiny. They certainly do. Oh why don't we get together once, and we can talk about the things that everybody loves. That would be great. What about a pumelo? Think we could make a doll out of one of those? What's a pumelo? A pumelo is a Chinese grapefruit. Oh that's fucking fantastic. I love Chinese horoscopes.

Does everybody play this stuff? Is it like some kind of rule or something? - You should try working here. - No it really is everywhere, look at this. - Tis the season. - You know what I like to do? I like to put it on in my house. And then I pretend I'm there. (light music) (unintelligible talking) - Tamales? - Fuck off. Oh right, the apple puppets. - Dolls. - I don't know. - Oh come on. You can't stay in your house all day and night. - No that would be a terrible thing. - I'm making an apple pie. We have really fancy crackers. - You mean you have enough apples for (mumbles)? - What? - What time did you want me to come over, if I come over? - Seven. - 30. - 7:30. - Mine is not really coming together. - No it's fine. - I think you're maybe using too much straw. - Not enough. - It's your first time. - My first time. - Colleen. - What? - Were you really in the circus? - Kind of. I was an actress. - Yeah? Have I seen you in anything? - I don’t know. I did about 35 movies in 30 years. - Wow. - It's strange to remember your life by what project you were involved in. Most people have kids or vacations. Pets. Something to remind themselves how they lived. Or that they lived I should say. - I could never be an actress. - Why not? - I don't know. Memorizing lines, pretending you're someone else. Just doesn't seem like it would be for me. - Being someone else can be very addictive. It's funny how familiar being a stranger can be. It's so comfortable it's like... You can't think of another way to breathe. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Too cute right? - My doll turned out terrible. - No. Tomorrow the glue will be dry. Can add a few touches. - You're so close to my house. - What do you mean? - I wish we could just keep walking. - We could keep walking. - No no I mean keep walking home. Wouldn't that be wonderful? - I don't know. I have to walk home after. - What am I doing here? - What? - I'm surrounded by a world of nothing. How did this nothing become my something? My... My middle of nothing. Nowhere. - It's beautiful here. - Nothing is. Beautiful. Tamales tamales tamales. Nothing. No one. - Well.. There certainly aren't any tamales out there. - No there are no fucking tamales. - No. - Did I tell you about Harvey? - Who's Harvey? - He's a fucking disaster (mumbles). A fucking disaster. I loved him. Or maybe I thought that I could love him. Losing my hope oh God, I hate that word. I never liked that word, never. Hope. Never trust a four letter word. Apparently I was just just a way for him to pass the time. (mumbles) a circus act if you will. - I'm sorry. - I had a terrible year. I lost everything. You know when I was 17 years old. I saw this blind woman walking down the street with her groceries. And there was no one around to help her. But she didn't seem to mind. I mean not at all. Not one bit. So I followed her home. She lived on the first floor of an old brown stone. I was fascinated by her. I looked through her window for about an hour. She started to put away her groceries. And then she began making dinner. She was so beautiful. And it was so different from my life. I signed up for my first acting class the very next day. I think I needed something. Some way to channel all that empathy. That woman changed my life. She really did. He was 22. - Who was 22? - Harvey was. Can you believe that? - Maybe it's time. - For what? - I don't know, to appreciate it. - You know that they say that a change of scenery is like a death. But one of those good deaths. You know like we had start fresh. You have a new devotion to yourself. But you know what, since I got here, I feel like I lost something, and I don't know what it is. I have no interest in starting new. I feel like I lost something, and I don't know where. Maybe it's in these woods. - You know your house is right up the road, maybe we should go there first. - No no I lost something, and I think it's in these woods. - Colleen. - No. I'll be fine. - I can't just leave you out here like this. - [Voice-over] Please do, I will be fine. - [Voice-over] Was the character named Harvey West? - This isn't about him is it? - [Voice-over] What do you mean? - The reason I'm here. - [Voice-over] He's your most recent disappointment. Would you like to take something? We can help you feel better. - [Voice-over] Your smell is enough. Your smell is enough. - [Voice-over] Your smell is enough. - [Voice-over] Your smell is enough. - [Voice-over] Your smell is enough. - [Voice-over] Limb to limb, I follow you. Limb to limb, I follow you. - [Voice-over] All of the sudden I miss the sun. - [Voice-over] We will listen to the warmth. - [Voice-over] All of the sudden I miss everyone. - Tamales. - Fuck off. - Merry Christmas. - Rick. - How are you? - I'm terrible. - So I got in my car and I started driving. And then I said wait a minute it's almost Christmas. I've gotta come and visit my sister. - That's so thoughtful of you Rick. - So how are you? What's it like out here? - It's not good. They're building an absurd number of houses across the way. - Everywhere. - I get about 30 minutes of quiet in the morning and then. I have all the time in the world to myself. Glorious, uninterrupted, beautiful, gorgeous, time alone. - I couldn't do it. - Yeah which part? - You have any visitors? - No, no I don't. You are my first. - Really? What about neighbors, you got neighbors? - Yeah. There's one lady and she took me out in the woods and left me there. - That's good. The kindest of strangers. - I wish she was a stranger. Sometimes I think that the kindest part in my heart is for strangers. Do you know that this woman, she took me over to her house, and she made me make these dolls out of apples. And straw. - [Voice-over] I've been writing. - Sounds great, fiction or non fiction? - Fiction. Started out as a short story but, the ideas just kept growing and I mean my mind's on fire all the time, it's just gotten so big. - Fantastic, what's it about? - Office supplies. - Office supplies. - Yeah you know when the employees go home and the office supplies intermingle and they play games and stuff like that? Its a great idea, you know what it wouldn't be a bad movie. It would be a great animated film. - [Voice-over] Well those are certainly very popular. - [Voice-over] Exactly, I don't think they've done one yet on office supplies. - That's very observant of you. What the hell is that? - It's a rat. - What is a rat doing here? - It's either sun bathing or it's dead. - Get it. - I'm not getting it. - Rick get it. - Not getting it. - Pick it up please. - I'm not picking the fucking rat up. - What does a dead rat mean? You think it's an omen? - In love and death, the most important thing is letting go. - It's a rat Rick. - Regardless, it's the end of a life. - I think we should go back inside. - I think we oughta give it a name. - What? - The rat, can you name something you never knew? - Do you feel you never knew me? - Why does it always have to come back to you? Can't we give the rat a minute of respect? And while we're at it, why don't we bury that moth eaten coat? How many minks did it take to make that thing? - It's our mother's coat. - It is? - Yeah. - Oh. Well it's beautiful then. I love mom. I love when she would walk around the house in that coat. And dad had one too do you remember? They had matching coats. - They did. - [Voice-over] To understand you. To understand you. To understand you. - What are you doing? - Painting. - The wall's already white. - Yes. But another coat won't hurt. - Who's that? - [Voice-over] A friend. - She's very beautiful. - Yes. She's beautiful in many ways. - You're painting a wall that's already been painted. - I know. - Yeah why? I just want to know why. - If I don't paint it, who will? - Yeah but... You don't need to paint it now is this some... Did someone tell you to do this? - I don't know. - That girl did she make you paint this wall? - Why do you keep asking me that same question? - I don't know. - Are you mad at me? - You're not allowed to ask me that anymore. - Do you hate me? - That either. I want to touch your face. Can I just touch your face? - You wouldn't want to get paint on your hands would you? - Where did you go? - I'm right here. - You're here but you're not here. - If I'm not here, then I am with her. - [Voice-over] So... You're not here with me. - [Voice-over] No I'm here with you too. - So you're here with both of us? - Yes. - When you leave. - I have to finish painting before I can... - But when you leave will... Will we leave together? Will you leave here with me? - I'm not sure. - Why are you not sure? - Because I don't know. - Why can't you know, I just I need you to know. - I'm not sure. - You don't need to paint that wall. (machine noise) - over easy just like you like them. Why don't we take a walk to see what they're building down there? - A walk in the woods? - Yeah that would be fun. We could see what they're doing, we just hear noise, let's find out what the noise is. - Did you ever wonder if there was another version of you somewhere in the world? Maybe they were a day ahead of you or a day behind you. - What? - Another version of yourself. A more realized version of you. - That's a little over my head. - Nevermind. - You know once I was at a bar and this woman told me that I had a twin. And he was a garage mechanic and he lived right down the street. But I never saw him. - Right down the street. Why were we never close? - You know I hate California. - No, Rick. Close like families are. Close. - Because you were always working. And when we would get together, it was for such a brief amount of time. I mean we never got below the surface. You know I stopped watching your movies. - Really? When was that? - A few years ago. - Everybody else stopped a few years ago. - I just couldn't watch you anymore, I mean I know it doesn't make any sense. - Oh no it makes sense. - I just didn't want our relationship to be through your art. - You know what occurred to me? That of all the parts I played, all those characters. They never experienced joy. They were joyless. And then I started to wonder if I ever experienced joy. And I had moments of happiness but, I was never able to hang onto it. (mumbles) I'm joyless. - You know when I heard you were retiring I panicked. I thought you were dying. - Jesus. - I mean why else would you do that? Why would you do this? - Is this some kind of debt? - Do you think it is? - Rick, do you think a person can be aware of their own madness? - I've told you 1000 times, you're not mad. You're just lonely. - My whole being is in pining. - Where should I look? - Look at me. Look at me like I'm the only. - [Voice-over] What, the only what? - [Voice-over] Don't say anything. Just hold still. Hold still. Don't look. Look up. Look up. Eyes to me. (light music) I'm here to make good. - Yeah? How so? - Well my agent sent me this letter. And according to Marcus, I am responsible for a broken globe, so here I am, I'm here to make good. Maybe I could just bring it to his class room. - I'm sorry we don't have a Marcus here. - Well who wrote the letter? - No idea. You said your agent sent you this letter? - Yeah I was one of his actors. - No Marcus here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - So so... Is this real? - It could be made up, I don't know. - Why would he make it up? - I have no idea. The letter made you feel good though right? - No. Between you and me the letter made me feel like crap. And this Marcus, he's a little piece of shit. - There is no Marcus. If there was a fucking Marcus, he would be a sarcastic, ungrateful, piece of shit. You're not getting my globe. Fuckers. What brand are those? Give me one. What kinda school is this? - A shitty one. - Alternative academy? So you're a fuck up. - Definitely. You seem pretty fucked up. - Do I? - Yeah. - That's very fucking observant. - Well they have a psychology class here. - Learning is so important. - Sometimes. - You know if I ever saw again, I'd call you fucking Marcus. - Did you ever want to have kids? - No. And then yes. - No and then yes. - I was so committed to my craft, to myself as an artist that I couldn't give any part of it up. I was totally selfish. Could I have been some child's mother who knows? They say that you get the kids you deserve, something like that I think. I don't know what I would have deserved. - Well you know in many ways your characters could be thought of as your children. - That's a horrifying thought. - [Voice-over] Its never occurred to you though? - Yeah it has but, who would want to hold on to something like that, I mean, as an artist you must let go. It's different every time. - [Voice-over] So you're saying there's not one way to go about it? - No, of course not. The process is so liquid. Takes a hell of a lot to keep yourself from drowning. I think it's just, I don't think they - [Voice-over] Do whatever they want. (unintelligible talking) - [Voice-over] I think the head can get in the tail. I don't think the tail can get in the head. - [Voice-over] Yes. I think you're right. - [Voice-over] I think so. - You know they're spraying tonight. - Spraying what? - The new houses. Guess they have a moth problem, the moths are eating the trees. - I thought they killed all the trees. - They're called skeletons. - Sounds like something I could love. - Guess we're supposed to stay inside while they spray. - Oh yeah because they wouldn't want to kill us. - They probably do. - You know. I bet you wouldn't think to check on me for a week. Maybe even 10 days. - But if I was dead, I wouldn't be able to check on you. - But I could still go to the woods. - You're going to the rat party right? - Yeah. You going? - Yeah. See you there.
