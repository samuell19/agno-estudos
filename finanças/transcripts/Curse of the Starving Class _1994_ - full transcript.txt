Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment Emma! Turn that damn thing down! Emma! I don't know how you can get any studying done with that mess blaring out. Come on, cinnamon. He ain't sleeping with me, and neither are you. Good night. I was lying on my back. I could smell the avocado blossoms. I could hear the coyotes. I could hear stock cars squealing off down the street. I could feel myself lying in my bed... My room... This house... This town, this state, this country. I could feel this country close, like it was part of my bones. I could even feel the presence of all the people outside at night in the dark. Even the sleeping people I could feel, even the sleeping animals-- the dogs, peacocks, bulls-- even tractors sitting in the wetness waiting for the sun to come up. I was looking up at all my model airplanes hanging by their thin metal wires, floating, swaying very quietly, like they were being blown by someone's breath... Cobwebs moving with them, dust covering their wings, decals peeling off their wings. My p-39, my messerschmitt, my jap zero. I could feel myself lying far below them like-- like I was on an ocean and they were overhead on reconnaissance, floating, scouting me, taking pictures of the enemy-- me... The enemy. I could feel the space around me like a big, black world, and I was listening like an animal, and my listening was afraid. It was afraid of sound. It was tense, like any second, something could invade me. Hey, John. See that man over there? Give him a drink on me. You never seen anything like this. So she takes her tassels, puts them on-- get your ass out of here! Hey, listen! Did you hear that band? Hey, pig face, you going to buy me another cocktail, or you want me to baptize your ass with this one? Man's got to do what a man's got to do, will. Besides, let's let bygones be bygones. I'm a changed man. A changed man! Isn't that what will said when he fired your ass? He can kiss my ass. Kind of like that. That's what I like there. Weston, if you do that again, my daddy's going to kick your ass. I love it when she talks dirty to me. Let's hear the one about the-- about the cat and the rat, huh? Dumb son of a bitch, I've told you that story a thousand times. It was an eagle and a cat. An eagle? And a cat. Tate! Hey, weston! Game's over, party boy. You got that right, boy. Tate! Where's that fucked-up dirtball? Son of a bitch said he'd be here. Ooh! We're tired of looking for your ass. Show yourself, you faggot son of a bitch! Come on out here, son. You're up to your ass in debt, weston. Time to pay the Piper. You don't pay up, we'll gut you like a pig, you bastard son of a bitch! That's right, baby. You got that right. Where are you? Shh! I can smell your ass. You tell that son of a bitch he's a fucking dead man. Slither out here, you scumbag. Kind of a posthypnotic suggestion. Better tell him he's a goner. Come on out. Come on out. He ain't going to get away this time. You don't pay up, we're going to gut you like a pig. Boy, we'll kill you! What? It won't hurt for long, Tate. Tate, you slippery son of a bitch! Bingo! Get out of the way, you fucking faggots! Goddamn it! Who are you calling a fag? Sure glad that ain't my fucking car. Weston... You're pushing your luck, boy. Trying to catch me, goddamn it! I'm just gone with the wind! Yeah, take this, you motherfucker! ...damn particular about everything. You can have it or not have it! They can kiss my ass if they want to, but I have the answer, and that's it! Goddamn, I told that kid to fix this thing! Can't keep cars clean anymore. O.K., baby! Old weston's home! Yeah, that's right! Come on! Get the fucking, goddamn door! Damn it! Yeah, well, you think you can keep me out. Well, you can't, goddamn it! This is my fucking house! Scat, you damn cat. Kiss my ass, you furry fucker. Come here! That old damn cat and everybody else can get into this damn house, damn it. Open this goddamn door, Ella! Damn it! Can't keep old weston out. Thought you were going to stop old weston, didn't you? Open this door, damn it! Ella! Wesley! Emma! Can you send somebody out here now? Ella! You open this door, damn it! To--to the Tate farm. This is my castle! This is my home! Ella, baby. Now, come on. It's weston. Here's your old eagle, flying on down to his nest. Now, come on. Damn it! My husband's breaking in the house. He's out of his mind. He's getting in here now. Sons of bitches! Ahh! Sons of bitches, I'm leaving. Fuck you all. He should be doing that. He's the one who broke it down. He's not here. Well, just leave it till he gets back. He just wanted to get in. There's plenty of other ways to get into a house. Climb through a window. You locked the door. Sure, I locked it. Told him next time that happened, I was locking the door and he could sleep in a hotel. Well, what did you think? He was going to kill you? Smell him right through the door. He was drinking that much? Not that. His skin. Oh. You want some breakfast? No, thanks. Well, I'm going to have some. It's humiliating to have the cops come to your house. Makes me feel like we're someone else. We're not in trouble. He's the one who's in trouble. Yeah, well, you didn't have to call the cops. Now, I know the first thing you'll think is that you've hurt yourself. But I want you to know the truth, all the facts, before you go off and pick up a lot of lies. Now, the first thing is, you should never go swimming when that happens. It can cause you to bleed to death. The water just sucks it right out of you. But, ma, the Johnsons have a new heated pool. You should see it. They even got these blue lights around it at night, you know, like a fancy hotel. I said no swimming. That's what I meant. This thing is no joke. Your whole life is changing. You don't want to live in ignorance, do you? All right, then. Now, the next thing... Is sanitary napkins. You don't want to buy them out of any old machine in any old gas station bathroom. I know it says sanitized on the package, but they been sitting around those places for months. Gross. You don't know whose quarters go into those machines. All those innocent-looking silver quarters just spewing germs all over the napkins. How come they call them napkins? Well, I don't know. I didn't make it up. Somebody called them napkins a long time ago, and it just stuck. Sanitary napkins. It's got a funny sound, you know, like a hospital or something. You should know that anything you stick up in there should be absolutely hospital clean. What are those things? They're for my demonstration. What demonstration? For 4-h. You know, I'm giving a demonstration at the fair. I told you all this before. I don't believe-- where's my chicken? What chicken? Oh, I forgot you were doing that. I thought that wasn't for a month yet. I just stuck it in here yesterday, ma! You didn't use it, did you? Why would I use it? Don't start screaming in here. Go outside if you're going to scream. What are you looking at, you goddamn hick? That was my chicken, and you fucking ate it! I raised that chicken from the Incubator to the grave, and you ate it! I didn't know it was hers. You used it with no consideration for the labor involved! I had to feed that chicken... Well, did she have her name on it? No, of course not. Then she's got nothing to be screaming about. Then I had to kill it with an ax! And I had to pluck every feather on its goddamn body! I do all this work so you can take it and eat it! Ugh! I can't believe what goes on around here. Shut up! If you didn't want anybody to eat it, then you should've put your name on it. Yeah. Fuck you, o.K.? What's all this stuff? Her charts. She's giving a demonstration. On what? How to cut up a chicken. What else? Everybody knows how to cut up a chicken. I know how to cut up a chicken, for Christ's sake! Oh, you do? Did you know there's certain bones you have to crack and, if you got the anatomy right, you're halfway there? It's just a chicken. There is no consideration! If I had come across a chicken in the freezer, I would've asked someone first before I ate it. Not if you were starving! Yeah, well, no one is starving in this house! There's food on the table right now, so nobody's starving! We do not belong to the starving class! There's no such thing as a starving class. There is so! There's a starving class of people, and we're not part of it! Well, I'm hungry. That's starving enough for me. You are so ignorant! Did you hear what she said? Oh, my lord. Emma. What? Emma, hon, I think you better come in here. What kind of family is this? I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen. I'm leaving. Can't say as I blame her. Why not? You can always blame someone. A real investment for the future... The future, the future. Mr. Tate, you may not realize it, but there's corporations behind me and this place here-- executive management, people of influence, people of importance, people such as yourself. Weston--may I call you weston?-- you look like the country-club type to me. Am I right? Huh? Am I right? The clubhouse is going to be right over there on that hill, just a five iron away. There's going to be shopping centers, banks, churches... All kinds of great things are going to be developed right here. A real investment for the future. Oh. Welcome home, wes. Welcome home, wes.

You real piece of shit. Call Sylvia Richards. Offer her my sincerest condolences on the passing of her husband John. I mean Jeff. Mr. Taylor? Yeah? Don't forget your appointment, honey. Find out how much she wants for the house. I got to get me an "a." Well, she's already decided to leave home. That's a beginning. She's too young to leave. And get out of that refrigerator. You'd think we were starving. We're not rich. We're not poor. So what are we, then? We're somewhere in-between. We're going to have some money, though, real soon. We'll get out of this place once and for all. Where are we going? Paris, maybe. Wouldn't you like to go to Paris, Europe? No. Oh, they have everything there-- high art, paintings, castles, buildings, fancy foods. They got all that here. Why aren't you sensitive like your grandfather was? I thought you were just like him, but you're not, are you? No. You're circumcised just like him. It's almost identical, in fact. How do you know? He's dead. When he was alive is when I looked. Don't be ridiculous. What did you do? Sneak into his room or something? We lived in a small house. Come on, girls. Bawk bawk. Come on, girls. So where's this money coming from, anyway? What money? The money that's going to make us rich. I'm selling the farm. It's not yours. It is mine-- or was. We got married and mortgaged it. You're not telling him about it? No. Then it's not legal. It's legal. I already checked with a lawyer. A lawyer? Yeah. He's very successful. He's a real big shot. He's handling everything for me. How are you going to pay this big shot? He's only taking a small percentage. You know, Wesley, people like us don't always have a lot of choices. You're just going to-- you're just going to split the money with him without telling anybody? You could come with me. No. No. This is where I live. This is my home. I want to make a go of it. Some home. You're not even going to make enough for a trip to Mexico off this house. It's infested with termites. This is wonderful property for development. Do you have any idea how much land is going for these days? Not very much. You're crazy. Thousands and thousands are being spent every day on properties just like this. Who takes care of the place, anyway? I take care of it! I'm talking about fixing it up, making it look like somebody lives here, like it did when your grandpa left it. Somebody does live here. Who? Not your father. He works on it. I've seen him. He waters it. How often is that? He comes in and passes out for 3 days at a time and then disappears for a week. You call that work? I'm selling. That's all there is to it. He's going to kill you when he finds out. We'll be dead of starvation by the time he comes home. Same as it ever was. Here, boy. Steady. There you go. No! He dragged me clear across the corral. I told you not to play around with that fool horse. He's insane. I had the whole trip planned out in my head. I was heading for Mexico. How am I ever going to get out of here? I can't stay here forever. Honey, nobody's going to stay here forever. We're all leaving. We are? Yeah. We're going to Europe. Pops, too? Um, no. Probably not. How come? He'd like Europe, wouldn't he? I don't know. You mean just you and me and wes are going to Europe? Yeah. That sounds awful. It would be fun. It would be like a vacation. It'll be the same as it is here. No, it wouldn't. We'd be in a whole new place. We'd be in Europe. Everything else would all be the same. We'd still be the same people. What is the matter with you? Why do you say things like that? I want to work on a fishing boat. You know? Make my way down the coast. Stopping at all the little towns... Speaking Spanish. Mexico? I'd learn to be a mechanic. Oh. You know? Work on four-wheel drives and transmissions... Be a short-order cook... And write novels on the side. I can't follow the way you talk anymore. Well, that's good, because if you could, then that would mean you understood me. Hello! Anything in here? We're not broke, you know, so you don't have to hide. I don't know where the money goes to, but we are not broke. We're not part of the starving class! You haven't seen my chicken, have you? Motherfucker! Last call. Last call. Locking the gate. Everybody out. Oh, damn it! Damn it! Goddamn it! Hey, will! Will, old buddy! Hey, whoa! Anything open up for me yet? For crying out loud! Will you give me a break? You were the best I had. Then you stuck your head in that damn bottle. Will, a man drinks once in a while. Doesn't make him a bad person. I've changed, anyway. Yeah. Looks like it. Yeah. What you are is pitiful. I'm not pitiful, you son of a bitch! I was dropping bombs for my country! You were out wearing ladies lingerie! Don't you have any pride? I got pride! Here's my pride right here. Kiss my ass. Kiss my chicken ass. Oh, yeah? Go home! Well, look, I just pulled up. Yeah. Well, don't worry. You're going to get a taste. O.K. All right. Hello.

What do you want my mother for? I already told you. Does she bleed? What? You know. Does she have blood coming out of her? I do. Marvelous house. Marvelous. You know what I see? I see potential. Yeah. Oh. You must be the son. Yeah, I'm the son. I feel like I'm on enemy territory. You are. I haven't felt this way since the war. What war? What's the matter with him? Maggots. Well, can't you keep him outside? He's going to spread germs in here. Invisible germs, mysteriously floating around in the air. Tstz! Tstz! Anything's a potential carrier. It does seem that if the animal has maggots, he shouldn't be in the kitchen... Near the food. We haven't got any food. Well, when you do have food, you prepare it in here, don't you? My brother peed out there on the floor where you were standing. God! Do you always talk this way to strangers? It's the truth. He peed right out there on my chart. Oh, God. These are new boots. You the one who's trying to sell the house? We're negotiating, yes. What? Trying to sell what, this house? Where are we supposed to live? You're leaving home. What do you care? Mom! Is all this shouting really necessary? I wasn't expecting you for another half-hour. Well, I saw the car outside, and I thought-- if I'm imposing. Wesley, what's that thing doing in here? It's got maggots. Get it out of the kitchen. It needs warmth. Get it out. Mamma, are you selling our house? Who told her? Well, I'm afraid it slipped out. I'm not going to discuss it now. Just go change your clothes. Very nice to have met you. He's sullen by nature. Picks it up from his father. I see. Why, thank you. Ha ha ha! You always wear the prettiest suits. Yeah? You like this? Yeah. Who's your tailor? Ha ha ha! Taylor's tailor. Taylor's tailor. I got my own tailor. I am Taylor. Ha ha ha! Here. Let me get this. I'll move the briefcase. Put it back here. There we go. Your chariot awaits. See you later. I'll miss you. Ha ha ha! Yeah. Got reservations. Eat American lamb. 20 million coyotes can't be wrong. You know, you're lucky this is a civilized household. You're lucky this isn't Africa. You're skinny and starving, but it makes no difference because there's someone starving more than you, and their hunger takes them outside, with a knife. Slit your throat and eat you raw. Ssst. I got to get this fixed someday. Damn it. Who put these goddamn boxes here? God! Damn it! What the hell are you doing in here? Is this inside? Or outside? Even with that door out, it's still inside, right? Right. So... What the hell are you doing in here if this is inside? Hello, baby! Perfect. Zero. Absolutely nada! Goose eggs! Gone and left everything up to the old man once again! What's everybody hoping for around here, a miracle? The age of miracles is over. No, sir. They've been all used up. Aah! Oh, man! What are you sneaking around for? What are you yelling for? There's nobody here. You'll get yourself killed doing that. What's in the bag? Artichokes. Artichokes. Groceries. Somebody's got to feed this family. Hello, baby! So where'd you get them? I got them for half-price out there in hot Springs. You went all the way out there for artichokes? Do I look like an idiot to you? I went out there to look at my land. What land? My desert land. Can't you see it? Now, you stop talking. Everything was all right till you came in. I was talking to myself, and everything was all right. I didn't know you had any land in the desert. Of course I do. I got an acre and a half out there. You never told me about it. I told your mother. Why should I tell you? She never told me. Here's to Paris. Here's to hot couture. Whew! Yeah. The way I see it... You need me. Yeah? I'll tell you why, mon cherie. Because I'm what they call... A winner. I made my first mil before I was 20. 'Course, I lost it before I was 21. My first wife said I peaked too early. But I say-- shh! I say a kiss is worth a thousand words. So what kind of land is it? It's not what I expected, that's for sure. What is it, then? Some guy talked a real good line, said it was an investment in the future, all kinds of great things. Golf courses, shopping centers, banks-- great things. So I bought it. How much? I borrowed the money. It wasn't real. So you were had, weren't you? A real piece of shit-- just a bunch of strings on sticks with lizards blowing across it. So where's this guy now? What's the matter with him? He has maggots. Poor little bugger. You poor little bugger. Huh? You poor little bugger. Better put some of that blue shit on him. That will fix him up. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. The blue shit. Little bugger. Yeah, I was even thinking of selling this place. Oh, you were? Yeah. Don't tell your mother, though. I won't. I was thinking of buying me some land down in Mexico. You little bugger. Don't forget about the blue shit. Can't afford to lose any more. Only had but 2 sets of twins this year. 3. 3, then. Three's more than 2, but it's still not that much. Hey, where are you going? I'm going to hell and back, boy. Going to hell and back. Yep. Hey, darling, you want to dance? I can't dance with you, Wesley. I got maggots. Maggots? How'd you get maggots? Picked 'em up on the farm. Ate some bad stuff. I'll fix you right up. Take you inside. Annie, honey, get me an outside line, will you? Thanks. Well, dial it, then, o.K.? It's 856-7392. Yeah. Dave... All systems go. I don't think that will be an issue. No. No. Just call him. Yeah. Ig...Nore...It. Yeah. O.K. 2 hours. Honey pie! Do you think she's making it with that guy? Who, Taylor? How should I know? Well, I think she is. She's after his money. Well, he's after our money. Why shouldn't she be after his? What money? Our potential money. She sees him as an easy ticket. She doesn't want to be stuck out here all her life. She should have thought of that a long time ago. She can't think. Pop can't, either. He won't let her. How can you think when you're behind the eightball all the time? You don't understand what's happening here, do you? With what? The house. Taylor. He works for an agency. It's land development. So what? So it's more than just losing a house. It's losing a country. You make it sound like an invasion. It's a zombie invasion. Taylor's their leader. They'll be filing through the door soon. Stop being so ignorant. Everybody knows there's no such thing as zombies. Big bulldozers crashing through the walls, foremen with their sleeves rolled up, blueprints under their arms, cement pilings, prefab walls-- a whole zombie city right here. Get your coat? No. Whoa! Ho ho ho! Shit! Who the hell was that? Probably looking for pops. Assholes! Let's get back and see what the deal is. Hey, asshole! What's the matter, hon? Nothing. Feeling a little guilty? No. You're not ready to put that little gold ring back on your finger and run home to papa now, are you? Say, uh-- Hey, darling, ever heard of a fella named weston Tate? No. You're sure? No, I haven't. I'm sorry. Because we need to find him real bad, darling. I left something in the room. I'm going to go get it. I'll be back in just a few minutes. O.K.? Real dream. Well, business first or pleasure? Well, pleasure. What do you think? There you go. Heavy elbow. Come on, Ellis. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Me. Now... Here's to it. Yeah. Now... Business. What is this? What the hell is this? I fixed the door. What was the matter with the old one? You broke it down. My laundry done yet? She didn't come back yet. Who didn't? Mamma. Well, it's been all night. Hasn't the sun rised and falled on this miserable planet? Yes, sir. Where's she been? She went with a lawyer. A what? Some guy named... Named Taylor. Taylor. A lawyer. Taylor. Yeah, Taylor. And you knew? I thought she'd be back by now. You want to sit down, pop? What's that smell in here? Artichokes. Artichokes? What happened to that goddamn sheep you had in here? Is that what you were building, a damn barn for this sheep? I told you what I was doing. I was fixing the door. She didn't do any of this. None of it. It's the same as it was before! I'll do it. No! It's not your job! It's her job! Goddamn it! What does she do around here, anyway? Do you know? No. What do you think of this place? What, the house? The whole fandango. The orchard... The sky... The air. It's all right. It's a farm. What do you think of it? I wouldn't sell it. Wouldn't sell it. It's not yours to sell, is it? Well, I know, but... I wouldn't if it was. What good is it? Nothing around here but sorrow. It's just here, and we're on it, and we wouldn't be if it got sold. Your brother's not much in the brain department, is he? You're the straight-a student, aren't you? Yes, sir. Ahh... What are you thinking of doing with yourself? I--I don't know. You don't know? You don't know? Well, you best start thinking about something, because I found a buyer for this place. Cash on the line. Now what's gotten into her? She started her first period. Her what? Nah. She's too young for that. She's got it. What happens when I'm gone? You sit around here talking about your periods? You're not supposed to know when your sister has her period. They keep their periods secret. Damn. Go to sleep so I can finish fixing this door. What for? I'm selling the place! Why build a new door? Because I plan on living here right up to the point when I leave. Courageous outlook, my boy. I envy you. You don't envy me, do you? No, sir. That's because I'm full of poison-- infected. Yes, sir. Does my poison scare you? Nope. Good. You're growing up. I never saw my old man's poison till I was older than you. You know how I recognized it? No. I saw it in myself! I saw it in myself. How do you poison coyotes? Strychnine. How? Not what. How? You put it in the belly of a dead lamb. In the belly of a dead lamb. That's right. Watched my old man move around. Watched him move through rooms... Out of the way of my mother... Away from my brothers. Everybody was right there. Nobody saw him... But me. He lived apart... Right there in the midst of things. He lived apart. I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm so sorry. Who's the buyer? The buyer... The buyer. Oh, the guy who owns the alibi. He's going to give me cash, enough to get me down to Mexico. Can't touch me down there. Who? It's none of your goddamn business who! Why is it you always drive yourself under my skin? Because we don't get along. You're like having some kind of espionage spy around. Why are you watching me all the time? Huh? You know, you can watch me all you want, but you won't find a thing. You know, mom's trying to sell this place, too. That's who the guy is. I'll kill her! I'll kill them both! Where's my gun? I had a gun here, a captured gun. I took it from a gook. Now, take it easy! Youtake it easy! This is like living in a den of vipers. They're all snapping at you, trying to eat your face off. Goddamn it! Shh! Get out of here. I'm the one brings home the food! Where's my gun? Goddamn it! Huh? Look at this shit! I can't find anything! This is my house! She can't take it from me! You understand? It's mine! So back off and tell her-- where's my gun? Just go to bed, pops. Ha! I'm all right here. I feel numb. Feels good to be numb. Oh, God! You know, we don't have to sell. We could fix this place up. Nah. It's too late for that. I owe money. Taylor can't buy it without your signature. Taylor! God, I'll kill him! I'll take myself out with him at the same time, drive the old Cadillac right over him and crush his skull like a nut. Taylor--I forget. What's he look like? Crook. What the-- yeah, that's it. Like a crook. I'll find him. Your mother, too. I'll track their asses and shoot them in their bed! I'll splatter their fucking brains all over their fucking magic fingers vibrating bed. Then I'll slit his throat. Where's my knife? Ah, fuck it. I know how to kill. You know why? Because I was over there. You learn... How to make an adjustment to convince yourself it's all right. That's all. Just take it easy, pops, get some sleep. I'll kill him with a brick. I got one out back. Goddamn it. I'll kill him with my bare hands! I'll fucking... I'll strangle him. Damn-ass dog. Tear him apart! I... I flew... I flew... I flew bombers... Over nam... Cambodia. Oceans... Blue oceans. I need a drop on my command... Now. Ah! Ah! Aah! I'll snap his neck! Just snap it. Oh, yeah. I got into a mess of them old fire ants. I hate them things. I got a bite here. Why, Ella Jean Tate! Didn't I see you yesterday over at the motel? If I'm not mistaken... That wasn't wes. Uh! Where have you been? Out. Where's your boyfriend? What is that smell in here? It's artichokes. Pop brought them back from the desert. They smell like that? Yeah. Went down to look at that pathetic piece of property, huh? He never told me about it. That's another one of his shrewd business deals. Taylor? What? Taylor sold it to him, right? Don't be ridiculous. He knew it was worthless, and he sold it to him anyway, didn't he? Something can be worthless today, priceless tomorrow. You never know till afterward. I ain't leaving. We're all leaving. I sealed the deal-- the whole enchilada, over, including your father. Nah, you're too late. You missed the boat. He's already sold it. What? Where is he? Couldn't sell a goddamn shoestring! He's out there in the barn. Get this junk out of here! I'm tired of looking at it! It ain't broken. Well, get it out of here! I'm not going to tiptoe around here anymore. I will not feel like a foreigner in my own house! You hear me? He's going to kill Taylor. Oh, he's always going to kill somebody. No. He means it this time. He's got nothing to lose. He never did. He's going to kill you, too. You know what this is? It's a curse. I can feel it. Goes back and back to little... Cells and genes. It's tiny little swimming things just... Making up their minds without us... Plotting in the womb. Before that even-- in the air. We pass it on. We inherit it... And then pass it down. It just goes on and on like that... Without us. Whoo! Looky here, des. I ain't letting you in. Weston...Where is you, boy? Oh, man! Where is he? Huh? Sleeping one off, huh? Few too many, I bet. I told him to lighten up on them boilermakers. Kind of like farting in the wind. Name's Ellis. I run the alibi. Oops! Heh heh heh. Hey... What is that smell in here? It's artichokes. Artichokes, huh? Let's see. Damn! Smell kind of like stale piss to me. I never was much on vegetables. I'm a steak man myself. Meat and blood-- that's my motto. Makes your bones hard as ivory, boy. Do you always make a habit of wandering into people's houses like you own them? I do own this place, ma'am. Signed, sealed, and delivered. Got the money right here-- $15,000, cash money. $15,000? Yep. That's what he owes. That's what we made the deal for. Don't let him do it, mom. Look, boy, I did not have to show up here. Boy, your father's such a pushover. He signed the deal before a dollar crossed the bar. Now, I could have stung him easy. Just happens I'm a man of honor. Get him out of here. Don't you do it, boy. I've broken many a back in my day. You see, I don't realize my own strength. Before you know it, somebody gets hurt, and I really hate when that happens. You can't buy a piece of property from an alcoholic. They're not responsible for their actions. He owns it, don't he? No. I own it! That's not what he told me. I own it! It's already been sold! Get the hell out! Look, ma'am. I got the deed right here. Now how do you explain that? Uh, uh, uh! Who does he owe money to? Some pretty rough trade. Goddamn it! Where is he? He's passed out in the barn. Goddamn! I'd like to wring his neck! That's my boy. Hey. Hey, let me see that deed. Weston. Weston. Weston. Aah! I've seen some hard cases in my day, but this boy, he's dedicated, that's for sure. He drinks just like an irishman-- flat out. Ha ha ha ha! You say these guys are tough. What does he owe them for? He's borrowing all the time. He's got payments on the car, land in the desert. Always got some kind of scheme. Weston, get up! They'd kill him for 15,000 bucks? Yeah. People like that, you never know what they'd do. Maybe you could deliver it to them. No. I've done my share, even more so. He is going to have to do the rest. I ain't no messenger boy. Well, give it to me. What? I'll deliver it. Wesley, don't you touch that money. It's tainted. I'm his oldest son.You're his onlyson! All right, Sonny boy. Now, don't you go off half-cocked. That's a lot of spending money for a young man. Wesley... Wesley, give me the money! It doesn't belong to you! There's not enough here to live in Europe, mom. Heh heh! You know, I think I'll turn this place into a steakhouse. Would make a good steakhouse, wouldn't it? Yeah, sure. Whatever. It's yours. Wesley, give me the fucking money! It's my dad's farm. It's my farm. Wesley, come back here! Yeah, I'm going to work this baby. Ha ha! I might even have one of them eight-hole pitch 'n putt miniature golf courses. Nine holes, stupid. Full of potential. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had company. I've got the final draft all drawn up here. It's too late. What's too late? Weston sold it. Who is this guy? Sold it for $15,000. That's impossible. He can't sell this piece of property. He's incompetent. We've already been through that. Look, I don't know who the hell you are, but I suggest you get the hell on out of here. This is my deal. Who is this guy, anyway? He's the buyer. Took it right out from under you, didn't he? Nobody takes anything out from under me, son. I guess we'll have to settle this like men... In court. Hey, look. I had this checked out at city hall. Everything's aboveboard. Ha ha ha! The deed's got nothing to do with it, friend. I'm talking about psychological responsibility. Does that apply to the buying, the same as selling? You keep out of this, boy. Does that apply to... Selling a dried-up piece of land in the middle of the desert, no water, a 100 Miles from the nearest gas station? You're trying to divert the focus of the situation here now, see? Now the point is your husband is psychologically and emotionally unfit to be responsible for his own actions, and, therefore, any legal negotiations issuing from him cannot be held binding. Hey, who did-- you some kind of lawyer or something? Yeah. Where the hell do you get off talking like that about my house? It's not your house. That's what he's saying. Are you deaf? Listen, lady. I sell booze. Whole lot of weirdness come across my bar, but I have never in my life seen anything as crazy as this since my wife. Hey, des! Let's go home. I've got corporations behind me, people with vision who can see the future. You people think the whole world revolves around your petty little existence. You better take off, too, before it all catches up to you. We could have had it all, mon cherie. Just wasn't in the cards. John, I need two shooters. Two shooters. We got it. I.D. Yeah. Right here. Where's Ellis? You say, uh-- Oh, my God! Holy shit! Ah! This way, ma'am. Yeah. She shot the whole place up, and just lucky nobody was killed. What place? The alibi. What alibi? Oh, it's a little honky-tonk over on the West Side. Good God. Well, where do we go from here? Well, she got to spend the night here. She'll get arraigned tomorrow morning. Go on in. You can't fight other people's battles, honey. You never win that way. Hey! Where's my goddamn money? Oh! Give me my money, thief! Oh, jeez! Oh! Damn it! Get off of me, goddamn it! Hey, des. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Ah! Uh! Uh! Uh! Ella! You want paradise? Tell me about it. Telling me about paradise? Talk about paradise! There was some girl right there, and I didn't know. I said-- Fire, corpsman! You fire, corpsman! And you, my son... Why hath thou forsaken me? Uh! Oh... Oh, God. All I asked... I asked at all-- and then I got nothing! Nothing from you! Uh! Nothing... Aargh! Ahh... Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Oh... Oh! Oh! Ahh. Heh. Ohh. What happened to you, son? Huh? Hey, everything o.K.? Same as it ever was. Just ran into a brick wall, that's all. You been drinking or something? Let me smell your breath. Ellis took the money back. He's a damn crook. He got the house, too. Igot the house, and I'm staying. Look at this. I even fixed the door, see? Look at this. Didn't look. Yeah. You walked right through it. Watch. Perfecto. I'm going to fix up this whole place. It could be something if only somebody would take some interest in it. Got some hot coffee, nice and fresh. Have some. Fix you right up. Here. Straighten you right out. Here you go. Yeah. There. You know, I started thinking... Who is this... Walking in the orchard at 6:30 in the morning? Who owns it? You know, this farm was your grandpa's. I never felt it was mine, even when it was. You didn't? I took off my clothes. I walked around naked. It was like seeing a whole new person... A stranger... A stranger on my own farm. Then I come in here, heh! I find a whole mess of groceries in the icebox. Surprised the hell out of me. I felt like it was Christmas. Mom bought that stuff. I felt it was like coming back to my life after a long time being away and still being welcomed back. Then I started doing the laundry. Every time I'd bend down to pick up somebody's clothes... I could feel that person like they was right there in the room... Like they were... Still attached to you... Like they were part of you. And I could just hold them in my arms... Forever... So I'm thinking about giving this farm another shot. Is that old tractor still working? I could even sell that desert land I got. That's a prime location. It's only 3 hours from hot Springs. You know what that's like. Hi, darling. Damn it. Who put that lamb back in here? Well... I got him on his feet. It was nip and tuck for a while. He had them damn maggots right up into his small intestine. Blue shit did it. So where you been, anyway? Jail. Ha! Whoa! They finally caught up with you, did they? More likely than not they'd be after you, but that's not it, either. You want some breakfast? You're cooking? Yeah. Who did all this laundry? I did. So, now, where you been, huh? You been off with that fancy lawyer of yours? I've been to jail, like I said. On a visit? Yeah. Yeah, I was visiting our daughter. What?! Possession of firearms, malicious vandalism, breaking and entering, assault, violation of equestrian regulations. There's not many people her age can run up a list of credits like that. That's for sure. Could you? I'm not self-destructive. Doesn't run on my side of the family. You're the only one who doesn't have it. See? Only us. You know, I got it all figured out. See, the only way the curse sticks is if you let it. Oh, so now I'm the outsider. You come from a different class of people. Nobody raised their voice. You sobered up and awoke to a brand-new morning, didn't you? Please. I've been down there all night pulling Emma back together. I come back to Dr. Jekyll. Well, I'm not buying it. Would you like some coffee? No, I don't want any damn coffee! Get that goddamn sheep out of my kitchen! You got the language down, but your inflection's a little off. Weston, please, just leave it, will you? I'm exhausted. I have a headache! Try the table. Table? Yeah. See? Nice and hard. You'll sleep like a baby, and when you awake... The table? You see, that's the trouble with too much damn comfort. See? Here. Makes you forget where you come from. You think you're making headway, but you're not. You need a hard table, once in a while, just to bring you back, make you remember what you come from. Goddamn hard table to remind you! You should have been a preacher. You think so? Mm-hmm. You have the voice. Hmm. Wes! Deep... Resonating. Breakfast's on! Sometimes a little comfort isn't a bad thing. Mmm! Brand-new morning. Damn it. Now, what the hell's going on with you? I was yelling for you. Didn't you hear me? Nope. Your breakfast is ready. Now it's cold. Now, what are you doing in them old clothes, anyway? I found them. Why in the hell would you put on some old bum's clothes that have been throwed up in, pissed in, and God knows what? They fit. What did you do with that lamb? I butchered it. You butchered it? What for? 'Cause we're starving! The fridge is crammed full of food! Now, look, I know I ignored some of the chores around here, but I did the best I could. Hell, you know... We're not so bad off. I have seen real people starving, and we're not. You know what your problem is? You are too spoiled! This place is a paradise for a young person! What am I-- I'm supposed to feel guilty? You hear me? I am a reborn man! I am a whole new person now! They're going to kill you. What are you talking about? Who's going to kill me? You owe money. Who? Uh...I don't remember that. That's behind me now. Maybe you've changed, but you still owe them! Uh-uh. This is my house. You signed it over. Shut up! Now, see, here. I'm going to sell that land. Remember? It's phony land! The guy's run off to Mexico already! What guy? Taylor, mom's friend. No. This isn't right. I was on a whole new track here. They moved in on us like a creeping disease. We didn't even notice. I started over! Goddamn it, we can all start over! Get out of here. I ain't going to run anymore. Why not? You've been running your whole life. 'Cause this is where I settle down! I got nowhere to go. This is it! If you don't go, they'll kill us all. So go, get, while you still can. When I was in hock up to my elbows, I always banked on the future. Things couldn't get worse, only better. And so everybody wants you to buy things. Refrigerators... Cars, houses. Bullshit. They wouldn't be so generous if they didn't figure you had it coming in. Why not go into hock for a couple grand if it's all just numbers? And they want you to borrow even when they know you can't pay. You never hear the sound of change anymore. So I just figured, why not take advantage of it? I just went along with it. I just played ball. Better go. You must have thought I was dead or something. You must have thought I was never coming back. I never felt like I belonged here. You did. You were always going off. You kept looking for it out there, trying to piece it together. You couldn't figure out the jumps, from being born to growing up to dropping bombs or raising kids to hitting bars to this! It all turned on you somehow. What you needed was right here. You needed us. It's too late. They're coming for you. They know where we live! Where should I go? Mexico. Mexico. Yeah. Yeah, I can start a whole new life down there. You could, uh, join me. Maybe. If they find that guy and... Get my money back-- that real-estate guy-- what was his name? Taylor. Ruined me twice. Forever. Forever. He won't last a day down there. That's the first place they'll look. Don't eat off the floor! You're going to wind up diseased just like him. I'm hungry. What are you doing with his clothes on? Hmm? Are you supposed to be the big cheese now? Daddy bear? I tried his remedy, but it didn't work. He's got a remedy? Tried taking a hot bath, as hot as I could stand it. I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing happened. So, you know, I went outside, and I started digging in the garbage, and, well, I found his clothes. In the garbage? Lamb's blood. Lamb's blood! All down my arms! And for a second, I thought it was me. I thought it was me that was bleeding. You're even more disgusting than him. Every time I put on one of his things, I could feel him growing on me. Like the changing of the guard, I could-- I could feel him coming in and me going out! You did the best you could. You really did the best you could, and that's all you can. I didn't do a thing. That's what I mean. I just grew up here. How--how come I'm going backwards? Because you don't look ahead, that's why. You can't just believe people when they look you in the eyes. You have to look behind them and see what they're standing in front of, what they're hiding. Everybody's hiding. Hey, where are you going? I'm out of here. Off to find pops. Long silence. No sound. No sight. Planes still hanging. Hearts still pounding. Then no sound. Then mom... Crying soft. Soft crying. Then no sound. Then softly crying. Then moving around the house. Then no moving. Then softly crying. Then stopping. And far off, the freeway could be heard.
