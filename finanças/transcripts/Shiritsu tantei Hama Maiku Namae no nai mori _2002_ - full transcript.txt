WESTERN -JAPANESE CINEMA CENTER MISSING HOSTESS FOUND DEAD Another murder in Kanagawa prefecture. This makes the third one. Another woman? Says she was 25. Oh, what a waste. Ever since Maiku was commended nothing good has happened. Been busy, too, since the papers wrote him up. Yes, it truly is a sad state of affairs. Today's really a slow day, isn't it? PRIVATE EYE SAVES CHILD This is Private Investigator Maiku Hama. I found the person you were looking for. That's right. I found her. My motto is "speed and certainty." I've already sent you her address together with the report. Yes. Good-bye. - I set up your fax machine. - Thank you, Akane. Now you can fax Yuriko. Come on. That's not it. I'm using the fax for work All right, all right. You're meeting her today, aren't you? You should bring her a present sometimes No, that would be embarrassing. Just take it. You don't understand a woman's heart. A woman's heart? Give her the present, okay? I'm off. All right, take care. A woman's heart? A woman's heart? Wait. What do you mean by that? Come in. Are you looking for someone? I charge 200,000 yen for two weeks. That is, unless it includes long-distance travel. Give me the description. I want you to look for me Asa! Here's the money I owe you with interest. It's weird having you pay back a loan. It's only natural. Are you busy? - I have to turn down work. - Refuse work? You'd even hunt down a dog for a buck. - You see a strange man go by? - Strange man? No one came by, did they? Really? Well, I'm off then So busy, so busy. Oh, look at this spotless car! - Good morning. - Thanks again. Take this. Have a drink. Thanks! I'm off then You take care of yourself now. The name's Maiku Hama. My real name. Private detective born and raised in Yokohama. The economy is bad, but my business is booming. My sister Akane has been admitted to a real good private college. My personal life's great too. Hate to admit it, but I'm in love. Everything's coming up roses. The first victim was a 22-year-old nurse, Rie Nakajima. The morning of May 4, she went home after the night shift Later that night, she went to a convenience store nearby. She went missing, and three days later... The second victim was a 25-year-old office worker, Reiko Ozawa. On May 19 at 4:00 p.m., she went to visit her fianc? Two days later... The third victim was a 23-year-old hostess from Yokosuka, Shizuka Kaneko. On the evening of June 3, she disappeared on her way to work. Two days later... The cause of all three deaths was poisoning. It caused respiratory failure. The name of the poison was ravonal. The victims were injected with over 50 mm. The bodies were moved later. The victims were all women in their 20s from Kanagawa. They were beautiful with long hair. No fingerprints have been found. Listen up. This kind of criminal will not stop until he is apprehended. Do everything in your power. The honour of the police force is on the line. That's all. - How long have you been a detective? - Three years, sir. - Still green. - Yes. I have a lotto learn. Look, kid. I don't plan to work with anyone. I can do this all by myself. But, sir- My style doesn't allow for preppies like you. Did you find out? Sure Maiku didn't catch on? Course not. I'm the best P.I. There is. Don't brag. Just tell us. Her name's Yuriko Yoshida. Born on June 1, 1968. She's 27. Works at the Yokohama post-office Volunteers at the Tsurumi Church. She grew up in an orphanage. - She's Christian. - Then it won't last. - Maiku and the church don't mix - I know he beat up at least five priests. Anything else about her? Yes. She's extremely quiet. Quiet? YOKOHAMA POST OFFICE I wanna eat. You hungry? KOBE RESTAURANT I bought a fax machine. Here's the number. L-U-V-M-A-l-K-U. Easy to remember, right? Let's eat. This is a great place. Today's my treat. I won at the races the other day. Since meeting you, I've been lucky. What's wrong? Horse-racing? No good? How about boat-racing? No? Auto-racing? Mah-jongg? No? All gambling- Don't like it, huh? How about my having lunch with you? It's not your volunteer day, is it? Can you skip the church? I see. Oh, right. What? You're happy? Really? Great! See you tomorrow. Hey, give that cat back. Come on. Let's do him in. Give it back! Let's get out of here. Let's split. Mikki, go home. Your sister's worried. Listen. I'm looking for a pervert around here. A guy who kills women with long hair and dumps them around here. It's not us. If you hear anything, you tell me. Not some other cop. Got that? Scum. Detective Nakayama, may I ask something? What? Why did he make the bodies so easy to find? Because he's trying to challenge us. What else? But why were they all wearing the same kind of dress? And why were they all wearing make-up? "Why?"You ask. You think we're on some TV detective show? Only TV detectives ask why. You don't think about his psychological profile? No. What's this smell? Some kind of perfume-don't know what On all three victims? They were all wearing the same kind of dress, the same make-up, the same hat, the same perfume. Must be the murderer's taste. - What is this smell? - Don't know. But we found traces of poison in the perfume on the dead women's clothing. Poison perfume. What are you doing? It's too soon. Sorry, I didn't understand. Shut up! No excuses. Mikki. Go back to your room. Idiot! I told you not to come in here. - Go watch the bath. - I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm really terribly sorry everyone. Don't worry about it, Mizuki. Mikki. You go and wait in your room. I'm really sorry. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. Excuse me, Manager. Can I work overtime today? Again? You really ought to rest. But you've been so good to me and Mikki. I want to make up for it. You're always working hard. I can't thank you enough. PAWN Do you like that girl? I'll ask Uncle. He'll do anything for us. Maiku. We're drinking till morning. No, I've got work to do. Work? Important work? Yes, I'm risking my life for it. Maiku, come and get me at the church at 7:00 tonight. Yuriko. What's this? You said you were risking your life. Maiku, you cause her problems, and you'll answer to me. Since I've been drunk, this country's gone to the dogs. Earthquakes, terrorists, serial killers. But whatever happens, you have to protect the woman you love. Protect her with your life. I know all that. I'm so happy. Akane's going to college. You've done well. I acknowledge that. Now it's your turn Hey, I'm talking to you. - Look at the time! - Wait! Maiku, wait! Stop it! Bastard! Yuriko. You okay? He's the murderer. I'm busy right now. Fools call me up every day. "I saw the murderer." "I was attacked." Some even tell me, "I did it." Any girl of yours must be pretty ugly. So this guy couldn't be him. It's just some stupid jerk. Some jerk wouldn't do something like this! That masked man is a client of yours. - But I turned him down. - I don't trust you. A hungry dog jumps at any bone. You wouldn't turn anyone down. And you call yourself a cop? Watch your lip. I'll tell them you're the murderer. Get lost, punk. You're interfering with my investigation. - You - - Excuse me. I'll look into it. If you need anything, call me. My name is Kozu. Please forgive Uncle. Sorry about that How's Mikki? You two getting along all right? Not as well as we get along. Really? Sorry to make you go through with all of this It doesn't matter I just want you to be happy. He insists that... he really wants that woman It's a problem. Have to get rid of that nuisance first. What shall we do? Use this. PRIVATE EYE SAVES CHILD FROM BURNING HOUSE This is the guy who's in our way This is from Uncle. We identified the poison in the syringe. Ravonal diluted with water. Ravonal. It's a sedative, but diluted, it becomes a sleeping potion. - Any fingerprints? - Only one set. Strange. There should be two. The criminal's and the private detective's. There was only one set. So, I have to postpone. I'm sorry. THE ADVENT OF HAPPINESS Listen. Did you send this? You wanna say that you're okay, right? From tomorrow... my own... work... returns. I'm doing this because I want to Don't worry about it. Good night. - Hey, wait up. - You come and get me Where are you? Let's do it now. Where are you? Ayumi! Where did you go? May I get in? What does Nakayama's man want at this time of night? I've been looking for you I want to ask you something about that incident. You said you grabbed his hand as he attacked your girlfriend. Yeah. His hand was really cold. Was he bare-handed? Yes. I see. What is it? Nothing. The langue des fleurs referent for valley lily. Langue des fleurs? Other referents, "Maria's Tears" and "Stairway to Heaven." For a cop, you know some strange things. Is it strange that I know the langue des fleurs? Mr. Hama. Is it interesting, being a private eye? Yeah, it's interesting. How about being a cop? Want a swig? You always carry this around? If I don't drink, I can't get through the day. Take this. I'll call you. Put it on carefully. Don't kill me. Not if you do as I say. Now, stand up. Stand. Walk over there. And embrace him. Go over there. Now say this. "Sorry, little boy. You must have been lonely." Sorry, little boy. You must have been lonely. "Mama's not going away. Mama's going to stay with her little boy." Mama's... not going away. Mama's going to stay with her little boy. Go on. Go on. Sorry, little boy. You must have... You must have been lonely. Mama's not going away. Mama's going to stay with her little boy. Let me go! Let me go! Is it your mother? We have a suspect. Detective Nakayama, it's someone you sent away to reform school. That punk will do anything for money Now that you mention it, he's been acting strange lately. Get an arrest warrant, and we'll follow Detective Nakayama's lead. Okay? - Detective Nakayama. - What? A word with you. What do you want? I was with Maiku at the time of the murder. What? You met Maiku Hama? Yes, I had some questions about the incident. Got any witnesses? No, just the two of us. Good. Don't tell anyone. But- Maiku is using you for an alibi. It won't stand up to questioning. A fingerprint is one of a kind. That's a standard of investigation. A fourth victim has been found. We got fingerprints off of her possessions. They're yours. What? And on the syringe too. What about other prints? Only yours. There's another you on the loose. That is, if you aren't the murderer. I didn't do it! I know, but fingerprints don't lie. Anyway, you need to get out Nakayama's coming to your office with an arrest warrant Why are you telling me this? I was with you at the time of the murder. I want to find the murderer. Keep your cell phone on all the time. I'll call you later. Wait, wait. You have to buy a ticket. Search the whole theatre Where did he go? Put his sister and his girlfriend on 24-hour watch Tap his phone too, on my authority! The suspect's car was found in front of the church. Another unit is on its way. The church? I'm going over there now. MARIA'S TEARS. I'm leaving, but don't worry. Trust me. Just keep telling them that you don't know me. Maiku. Burn this letter at once. You only call me when you're in trouble. Damn it! How could my fingerprints be on the victim? You mean, you didn't really do it? No way I could have! But the fingerprints- No one will believe you. - Did she say something? - Seems she can't speak. I'll talk to her. He escaped. Don't worry. Who are you? He didn't do it. Speak more slowly. Who are you? His friend. He was framed. Framed? By who? What are you saying? I asked where he was. She doesn't know. He's been pretty persistent, but they're not even lovers. Course not. Who could overfall for Maiku? I can see she doesn't know much I'll leave her to you. Keep questioning. I'll go look for him. Know anything about "Advent of Happiness"or"Maria's Tears"? No. You know this smell? This perfume? Where did you get this? I got it from Maiku. PRIVATE EYE DISAPPEARS - Brother! - Maiku. Maiku, calm down and listen. Akane's admission to college was rejected. Don't worry Who wants to go to that kind of college? I'll pass the test for a national university. Akane. Which school is that? I'll set fire to it. What does him being a serial killer have to do with you? I'm not a killer! Your phone's ringing. Detective Kozu is asking where you got the perfume. The perfume? This perfume? A young woman bought out the whole stock. They stopped making it 10 years ago. Made from valley lilies, but it's said to be poisonous. What kind of a woman was this? Nice young woman. She said she worked in a factory near Tsurumi. Excuse me. Can I ask you something? Do you recognize this smell? None of the women here wear stuff like that. Wait. I've smelled this before. Mizuki used to wear this Something you want? Yes, I have some questions. Do you know this perfume? This perfume. Two months ago I bought this scent in Yokohama. I bought it out of nostalgia. I certainly can't wear it around here, so I gave it all away. I regret that I didn't save a bottle for myself My mother-she's dead now- used to wear it. What about this perfume? So, it's all gone then? I've done all I can on my own. Perfume, a serial murder, and the langue des fleurs of lilies of the valley. What will you do? I'm going to find the actual criminal. How can you do that? A private eye has his own way of working, kid. The police have decided that it's you. If I don't go after you, it will look bad. Please be careful. About Yuriko- Please take care of her. She's under 24-hour surveillance. She's rather safe. Since the police have already decided that Maiku is the murderer, this is a challenge to all private eyes. We're going to find the real murderer... and save Maiku. Let the investigation begin. I know how you feel, but leave it to us. Maiku a murderer? I don't believe it. Something unbelievable happened. He was well-known in his youth as a delinquent. He was really wild. Called him Rabid Maiku. As in rabies? Idiots! Maiku would never do such things! P.I. BOOK I'm reporting on the perfume. The perfume is known as "Valley Lily". Made from the lilies of the valley. It has poisonous extracts which were detected in the perfume. I'm reporting on the factory woman. Mizuki Yamaguchi, around 30. Began working at Tsurumi Rubber Factory a year ago She's cheerful, well-liked there. In the end of April, she said she was going to her uncle's but went to a psychiatric hospital. She saw a certain Dr. Saburo Tachibana. They've known each other for a long time. Could he be the murderer? He killed himself on May 1. Gave himself a fatal injection of Isomytal. Unusual way to commit suicide Foul play was suspected but they found a suicide note. So the police concluded it was a suicide. What did it say? "Trying to save people is a trap. I'm killing myself to get free from this trap." He ran a third-rate clinic, but he graduated from a good medical school. He initially tried to help children with mental illnesses. He married Kimiko Sumida and founded the Tachibana Care Centre. Among the children were two kids who were left there at the same time. After that day, they only had bad luck. First, his wife was in a traffic accident. She was paralysed and had to be hospitalized. Then he was arrested for child molestation. His wife is still in the hospital. I think she is the key to this riddle. I'm going to see her. No. Leave it to me. You keep on hiding. Let me go! I want to do it myself. All right. Go on then. If you get caught, the game's over. Cops win. Remember that I understand. Let's go, Hoshino. Why me? You're the most dangerous man in Japan Why is it always like this? This'll cost you Maiku. What are you going to do? I'm going to walk right in. You know where her room is? Hello. KIMIKO SUMIDA Dr. Tachibana. How do you know that name? Back then I used to be your patient. Back then? At the Tachibana Care Centre. I really don't think too much about those days any more Not about Mizuki Yamaguchi either? Mizuki? That's a name I can never forget She's a demon. Get caught in her trap too? Could you tell me a little bit more about her? She is a girl who has very, very cold hands. Because of her schizophrenia, she has two personalities. That poor girl, we really wanted to help her. We worked so hard. At the same time, a little boy was left with us. He had a name, but we all called him Mikki. He was an orphan with serious non-congenital brain damage. Mizuki decided that he was her brother. She really took care of him. From then on, she caused all sorts of bad things to happen around her. Even one of our patients died. He fought with her, and she killed him with a knife. She took such pleasure in the misfortunes of other people. One day, she asked me to take her for a walk. Mikki came along too. We came to a busy street. She suddenly started to go across. I got worried and started after her. I stopped, relieved, when I saw that she'd gotten safely across the street. But then someone pushed me from behind. Who pushed you? I don't know. But when they saw me get hit by that truck, the two of them stood there and laughed. My husband didn't believe me. He tried even harder to help those two children. Why was your husband arrested? Mizuki reported him to the police. She said he'd molested her. Do you think people can save other people's souls? We don't even know what's in our own hearts. How can we know what is in theirs? What about Mikki? He was probably the sane one of those two. He kept looking for the mother who'd abandoned him. But that mother was just a figment of his imagination. After all, he'd been just two weeks old. There's no way he could have remembered her. Do lilies have a meaning for you? Lilies of the valley? Yuriko, don't turn your head. Don't worry We know Maiku's okay. I WANT TO HEAR HIS VOICE I understand. It's Yuriko, right? I've got more pieces to the puzzle. Soon, I'll know it all We'll be able to meet soon Are you near the church? Are the cops around? Sorry about all this. We can't talk till It's over. Okay? You'll find the serial murderer at this location. The number is- Who is this? I told you not to call. Yuriko. Yuriko? Maiku, the jig is up. Hoshino! Police Helicopter calling Headquarters. Presently above Sector P, heading to Sector V. Please inform on suspect's location. Watch out! Damn it! - Hoshino! - Sorry. Stop, or I'll shoot! Maiku. Getaway now. I'll do what I can. If they get you, I'll lose a close friend. - Hoshino. - Don't worry I've always wanted to do this. Just get out of here! Hoshino... Maiku, it's all over for you. Just give in. You - Hoshino! This toy gun just doesn't cut it. Why did you come back? Good-bye, Maiku. Open your eyes, Hoshino. Open your eyes! What are you doing? Your car was the most important thing! Hey! I'll sell it. Open your eyes! Stand back! Call an ambulance! Hoshino, you'll be okay. You'll be okay. Maiku, spit it out You'll feel a lot better afterwards. How many times I got to tell you? I didn't do it. Then whose fingerprints are these? They're yours! Even if you don't confess, as long as we've got these, you're going to hang! But if you confess, you might get off Probably only life. Don't you get it? I'm looking out for you! I didn't do it! You murderer! Maiku, spit it out Tell us everything you know! Let me take care of him. Get in. - You - - Sorry. We're getting out of here. What's taking you so long? How's Hoshino? He's got the devil's luck. He's all right. That bullet went right through his chest. He's in the police hospital. It's okay for you to do this? If I don't find the murderer, I'm in as much trouble as you are. I have to tell you something. What? Yuriko's been kidnapped. What? Your colleagues have found out where she is. They can save her at a moment's notice. We're going there now. Hurry up. Please. How's Yuriko? Nothing's happened to her yet We have a secret mike in her necklace. Stay calm, now. Yuriko told us that if something like this should happen, we should catch the murderer before saving her. Above all, she wants to save you. If you don't understand, then you just go and barge on in. Make yourself up. Put it on carefully. Stand up. Stand up. Walk over there.. and embrace him. Now say what I told you. Sorry, little boy. You must have been lonely. Mama's not going away. Mama's going to stay with her little boy. She's not your mother, is she? Let's kill her. This girl can't speak. You don't know your mother's voice. You were abandoned at birth. Your mother is me. I'll be your mother. Can you hear it? You are in here. I'll give birth to you, and I'll be your real mother. Are you happy, Mikki? Why? Why? We were... two people... as one, weren't? Mikki. Are my hands cold? Kozu here. I found the real murderer. Come quick. Yuriko! You are the murderer. THE MURDERER ARRESTED - She has no fingerprints? - That's why. I bet you're relieved, Akane. June 15, 1995, we commend you for capturing the serial murderer. This closes the Kanagawa Murder Case. The special task force is disbanded. Many thanks. Sneaky, doing it without me. I'll give it to you. Don't patronize me, punk. I'm quitting the force. What? What are you going to do? Going to be a private eye. Tulips everywhere All sorts of tulips, red, white, yellow This solved the case. Life is back to normal. First, put your heart into the investigation. Second, put your best into disguises.

I'll come meet you tonight. No? Will you be late? I see. How about 10:00? How about 10:30? Okay, 10:30 it is. Wait for him inside. Have some coffee. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN Mikki. Mikki. How many people have you killed up to now? Does it make you happy? With each one, your heart gets blacker. Like the darkness here. Is that right, Mikki? You thought you had me. But telephones transmit more than voices. Mizuki wasn't manipulating you. You were manipulating Mizuki. Was it revenge against the mother who abandoned you? No, right? You just kill because you want to Anyone will do. You have no reason. Isn't that right, Mikki? And you're just playing the fool, right? No use any more Yuriko would sacrifice herself to save others. Even a guy like you. But I won't. If you kill her, I'll kill you! Don't worry, Yuriko. I won't make a mistake. I've promised you. You - Bastard! Hey. Hold it! Mikki? Where did he go? Where did you go? How long has it been? What? Since Maiku disappeared. About nine months. I wish he'd told us where he was going. Just like him. What gets me is that he left with a woman. Hey, aren't we married? Oh, yeah. I forgot. Thank you. - I'm home. - Welcome back. Did everything go well with your freshman orientation? You're really something. You got into Yokohama National University. But where's Maiku gone off to? Hello. Thank you. I'm going back to Taiwan. Thank you for everything You are a true friend. My only friend.
