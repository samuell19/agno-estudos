Geppetto! You mischievous little boy. Look at what you've done! We'll tell your father... I want to fly! Fly high, my beautiful kite! I'm an airplane, a bird, a flying dragon! Look at me, kite! I'm a red and yellow kite, just like you! Hey,no! Don't leave me! I want to fly, like you, my kite! No! Don't leave me! Who's there? Who spoke? Last night's wine must be playing tricks on me. I could swear I heard a child's voice say... It spoke! The log spoke. Did you actually talk? Yes! What are you laughing about? Since when does a hunk of wood laugh like a child? A Child... Long ago there was a king who was lonesome on his own... Wooden eyes, why are you staring at me? What a cute face! But this nose, it's just too long. Coochi, coochi coo, little Puppet Geppetto! What's up? Lost your tongue? Hey! Give that back! You little rascal! You're not even carved yet, and you're already showing disrespect for your father. Oh, we'll so enjoy life together. We'll travel the world! And I'll call you, I'll call you... Pinocchio! - Pinocchio! - Pinocchio! Pinocchio! RED LOBSTER INN What in the world... If I catch you, you're through! What manners! What is he up to? Stop. An ill-disciplined puppet causing chaos. This marauding marionette must certainly be brought to justice! No, let go of me! Good morning, Geppetto! Do you know this thingamajig? He is my son. My son! Let's go. You're in for it when we get home! Poor little thing. He doesn't want to go home. That Geppetto looks like a decent man, but I'm not sure he can be trusted. There's no telling what he might do to that puppet! Come with us to the precinct. No more picking on that poor, persecuted puppet! Forward, march. - Help me, Pinocchio! - Come, Alidoro. I am your father. Don't let them take me away. - Pinocchio. - Who said my name? It's me, here. Where are you looking? I'm up here! I'm the Talking Cricket. I've been living here for over one hundred years. I am Pinocchio! The child who defies and disobeys ends up sorry in so many ways. Blah, blah, blah. Tomorrow I'm off. I'm leaving to see the world. If I stay, I'll be sent to school like other kids. If you don't want to go to school, why not learn a trade? You comedian cricket. The only job I'm interested in is eating, drinking and sleeping. - Poor Pinocchio, I pity you. - Why? Because you're just a defiant puppet with a wooden head and you'll end up in hospital or jail! - You irritating cricket! What's all this smoke? I don't know. Something must have caught fire. What could have caught fire? My feet! My poor feet! - Don't move! MY feet! My poor feet! What a disaster! Please, I beg you, make me new feet! Why on earth should I? So you can run away, wreak havoc and burn the house down? - Because you're my favorite father, daddy. - Oh, no, no! If this is the way you behave, I don't want to be your father. Yes, but you are, because you made me. You're my dearest daddy and I'm your precious Pinocchio. Please, daddy dearest, I promise I'll be good. I'll go to school, I'll help you, I'll be a comfort in your old age! - This is all my fault. I should have made you into a door-stop! Holy moly! Father, wonderful father. To show you my appreciation, I want to go to school, right away! School, my dear, is where one is taught what's true! You'll be tidy! You will speak only when you are spoken to! You'll do your homework, you'll learn reading, writing, arithmetic... You'll arrive on time, well-starched, well-groomed. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, of course, Headmaster, thank you. You're welcome. - Beg your pardon for your time, sir. - Father, we're not beggars. Please forgive our intrusion. So Pinocchio may begin tomorrow, yes? 8am, sharp! No, no, my boy. It's not polite to peek. ...how many apples will grandma have, in the end? - Are they always frozen still like that? - No, not always. Only for four hours a day. Now, wait for the lunch bell and sit up straight. Daddy, why is everyone so happy all of a sudden? Because lessons are over. Pinocchio, come on, wake up. Rise and shine, young man! Good morning, my boy! Get ready. It's time to go to school. School? No daddy, not today. It's my stomach. I have a terrible tummy-ache. I wouldn't understand anything, I'm too sick. I beg you, father, I also have a terrible headache... See what happens when you tell lies? Some lies have short legs, others have long noses. But I didn't lie! I'm sure that if you tell the truth, your nose will grow short again. SQ? My stomach ache's over. So is my head ache! Good, so let's have breakfast. Breakfast? Daddy dearest, I really do want to go to school, but too bad... Holy moly! There's a big problem. All the kids that go to school have a big book to read and study. I don't have that book, so... - You're right, son. That big book is an ABC book. It's a very expensive book. Unfortunately... Now you have your book, Pinocchio, because your father bought it for you! And inside, there's even money for a snack at school. Where's your coat, daddy? - I sold it. - Why? Because I was hot. Thank you, father. Thank you! Today I'll learn to read, tomorrow how to write and the day after that arithmetic! Then I'll be smart as a whip and make lots of money and buy father a new coat. Hello! I'm Pinocchio. - So what? I'm Pinocchio. That's right, Pinocchio! Cotton candy! Hot cotton candy! One, please. Here's ten cents. Thank you, sir! - Three, please! - Thirty cents. - Here you go, mister. - For ten cents, I can only give you one stick, son. That's not fair, I wanted... Come, ladies and gentlemen, step right up! A culturated theater-goer! Do you want to see this extravaganteous spectacle? Starring the haranguing Harlequin and numbskull Punch! Yes! Well then, procure your ticket before they sell out. Thank you, have a nice day. Next in line, step right up! Four coins. Enjoy the show! - Four coins... - Enjoy the show! Where do you think you're going? You have to pay for that ticket! - I know, but I don't have money. - Then you don't see the show! Could you lend me the money? I can give you my jacket. Give us his jacket! - Or my shoes, maybe? - Shoes! - What about that? - Yes, that! It's the brand new ABC book my father bought me and... Next in line. Four coins. Enjoy the show. No, it's a deal. Go on in and enjoy the show! Look, Punch. Do you see what I see? Oh my goodness gracious, it's our brother, Pinocchio! - Pinocchio! - Friendly players, I'm sorry. I don't have brothers or sisters, I'm an only-puppet! - Harlequin, did you hear that? - Yes! He said puppet! - Come here! - Come, chip off the old block! So you two are... YES. - My uncles! - And you're our nephew! What's going on here? Since when do puppets walk off stage in the middle of my show? Mr. Mangiafuoco... We recognized a relative out in the audience, and... - Good evening, Mr. Mangiafuoco... - Good evening, Mr. Mangiafuoco. What's that thing? He's Pinocchio, your Eminence. How dare something called Pinocchio interrupt my show? No, I was just... You stay right there. I'll settle my account with you tonight. - I don't know how to count. Actually, I was supposed to go to school... - Silence! The fire is almost out. You two, go get that Pinocchio. He's nice and dry. He'll make good firewood. Quickly, I'm hungry- Move, move, move. My friends, you've come to free me! Yes, we'll free you for now, but we have to take you to Mangiafuoco. He wants to throw you into the fire. What? No, I don't want to be burnt! Daddy, daddy, come save me! I don't want to die! It's about time. Give me that thing, I have to feed the fire. Please have mercy on me, Mr. Mangiafuoco, Sir! There are no sirs, here. Have mercy, good gentleman! There are no gentlemen, here. Have mercy, kind doctor! There are no doctors, here. Please, your Excellency, Sir-Doctor-Gentleman-Mangiafuoco, You must know that if you burn me, my dear daddy will die of heartache. - Well done! Mangiafuoco sneezed. - That means you've warmed his heart. Yes, and my poor mother will pull out all her hair and wander the streets calling my name. And at night, when the wolves howl at the moon, the poor, trembling woman with torn clothes and a starving belly... That's enough, you're spared. Soldiers! Grab Harlequin and throw him into the fire. What did you say? And what is that thing? Your Excellency, I lied. I don't have a mother. But I beg you to spare Harlequin. I spared you, now I have to burn him. Well then, take me, soldiers. Throw me into those flames. I'll never allow my dear friend Harlequin to die in my place! Alright, I'll eat my mutton half-cooked tonight. But, you, Pinocchio, have proven yourself to be a loyal friend, a good boy and a great actor. Come over here and give me a kiss. Cat! Fox! - Yessir! - Our illustrious prince! Take this precious puppet home to his father and protect him from thieves and charlatans, for I am giving him a gift and I don't want anyone to steal these five golden coins from him. Thank you, thank you so much, you have a kind heart, Mr. Mangiafuoco! Enough, that's fine. Go now, and be careful! Your wish is our command, boss! Come along now, come with us, you little whipper-snapper... - You're in our charge now. - And we'll be charging you. So tell me, dear boy, what will you do with your coins? First thing, I'll buy a beautiful new coat for my father, with a gold and silver lining, and with diamond buttons. And then... - That's too bad! - What's too bad? No, nothing. It's just a pity that all of your five measly coins will be gone. Your pitiful, paltry pittance gone. What a shame, considering it could become hundreds! Hundreds? Dozens, singletons! You mean thousands, millions. Right, that many coins. Pity! So... How can it become more? Hook, line and sinker. Well, it's fiendishly simple! In the City of Catchfools there's a meadow known as the Field of Wonders. - What happens in this field? - If one digs a small hole, and into said hole buries his coins, and punctiliously waters his crop... ...by the next morning there will have blossomed a splendorous tree full of golden coins. Could I go to the Field of Wonders? You? Certainly! - Where are you going? - I'm going to hug my father and tell him about the Field of Wonders. No! Why not? Because“. - Because if you do, you'll spoil the surprise! - In dubitably! The surprisee cannot be aforknowlegable of said surprise or the intended effect is effectless. - Are you sure? - Absolutely! What say we repair post-haste for succulent sustenance at the Red lobster Inn? - Let's stop for a bite and some rest. But wouldn't we be too late? Absolutely not! You're right. You two are such good friends. Let's go! Hey, close the window, we're freezing! - C'mon, we can't breathe! - What can I bring you, sirs? Just a sample, small portions. The doctor put me on a strict diet. A teensy tasting will satisfy me. I'm nauseous about food today. Ah, here's something light... I'll take 35 mullets with white sauce, four portions of tripe, two pepper steaks, a leg of lamb, four pounds of roast-potatoes, asparagus and carrots. And to add a few nibbles: I'll have one braised hare, three chickens, four bowls of veal stew, two partridges, a side of frogs' legs, candied beets, a bowl of grapes, nuts, dates and an assortment of desserts. Oh, and six coffees. Me too. And what about you? Bring whatever's left. Thirty-five fried mullets in white-sauce Four plates of tripe two pepper-steaks A leg of lamb, four pounds of potatoes Asparagus and candied carrots on a side dish Shrimps, zucchini, tortellini, vegetables and squid The gentleman ordered the braised hare And from the barbeque three roasted chickens ought to do Four bowls of tasty stew, six rabbits and frogs Some fruit and nuts and lots of dessert-treats Six coffees as well! Eat and drink and eat and drink... Holy moly! An earthquake! It was nothing. I was just coughing. - Where are they? - Your friends? They went outside to get some fresh air. Then I'll go, too. - There's a bill to pay. - Didn't they pay it? Are you joking? They're too refined to insult you that way. I wouldn't have been insulted. Give me one gold coin. Right now. - I ate practically nothing! - Are you on a diet? No, they ate practically everything! Really? Yes, so... I couldn't care less! Who's there? - Who are you? - I am the ghost of a cricket past. What do you want from me? Take those four coins to your poor father. He's desperately worried. Tomorrow he'll be happy because my four coins will be a million. He who promises great riches for free, is not to be trusted; that's certain! Puppet, don't leave! I'll do as I please. It's late in the eve! - I'll do as I please. - Don't be so naive! I'll do as I please. - You're being deceived! - I'll do as I please! - Leave me alone! - Your money or your life! Help! I don't have anything! Ah, yeah? We'll see. Where did you put the coins? Tell us. Talk. Surrender the gold or we'll terminate you! And we'll finish your father, too! No, not father! Ah, jingle-jangle. So that's where the treasure's at. Spit it out. Spit out the coins. Think you're so clever, huh? Hold him still. You're not holding him still. - Well you hold him then. And now let's prize open those jaws. Where did you leave your brain, you dummy? Whom are you insinuating to be a fool? He escaped. - He ran away! - So, what now? - We track him down. And catch him lickity-spit! - He's up there. - Descend, friend! I'm not a dummy. I'll show you. There's no need to go up a tree, if we can bring it down. Burn tree, burn! Puppet-boy, the flames are coming, very soon you will be succumbing Fire is fun, we can't help gawking. Pyro-mani-acally-talking! AH the colors, so exciting. Can you feel your feet igniting? Red and violet, blue and yellow, let the smoke just make you mellow. Shadows dancing, flames combusting. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust! Puppet-boy we tried to warn you. Now, alas, the world will mourn you. That puppet is indestructible. Quick. Have a nice bath, you mean villains! Hem: help! The bad guys want to get me. Open, Open! Please, I beg you, I'm being chased by bad guys. Open; Grab the coins. Wretched Puppet! - Help! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! - What on earth? Who is that, Geppetto? What are you doing down there? - Angelina, it's my boy. He didn't come home last night. My Pinocchio, where could he be? Go home and rest now, Geppetto. Tomorrow morning, the police will set out to search for him. Good morning to you, little snail, you've gone far along your trail. Barnaby, Barnaby, get the carriage, quick! Puppet! Answer me, little Puppet. Wake up. Can't you hear me? Aren't you alive? Oh, it's so sad, what a tragedy! Such a handsome puppet! Clysterium donare, Postea curare, Infinem purgare Clysterium donare, Postea curare, infinem purgare Quae sunt remedia Quae in maladia Dicta hydropisia Convenit facere Cum grandia difficultate Et poena de respirare Voletes mihi dire Quid illi facere? Quae remedia eticis Pulmonicis atque asmaticis, Trovas giustus facere Clysterium donare, Postea curare, infinem purgare Ma si maladia Opiniatria Quid illi facere? Cum grandia difficultate Et poena de respirare: Voletes mihi dire, Quid illi facere? Ma si maladia Opiniatria Non vult se guarire Quid illi facere? Good doctors, how is he? My dear Turquoise Fairy, I believe this puppet is dead. Unless of course he isn't dead. In which case he's still alive. I'm sorry to contradict my colleague, but I believe the puppet is alive. Unless by some terrible misfortune he's not alive, in which case, he'd be truly dead. Dr. Cricket, why haven't you spoken? I am a very cautious doctor. When I'm not sure what to say, it's best to stay quiet. After all, I know this puppet very well. He's a true rascal, an incorrigible ne'er-do-well and he's broken his father's heart. - Oh, good! When the dead man cries, he's evidently getting better. Well, well, I hate to contradict my colleague, but I believe that when a dead man cries, he's evidently sorry to be dead. Dear colleagues, time is money. We mustn't dwell on these silly details any longer. Whether the patient is alive or dead, our duty is to give him some medicine. In any event, call the gravedigger. - I couldn't agree with you more. - Right then, for the patient. Have a nice day. Give him this as well. Goodbye. And don't forget this. Farewell. Thank you. Goodbye, doctors. Come on, drink the medicine, poor sick little puppet. Oh, beautiful girl with turquoise hair, I'd do anything for you. But I won't drink the medicine, it's too bitter. I'll give you sugar if you drink it. - Give me the sugar, and I promise I'll drink. - Alright. That is just what I needed. I already feel better, much better actually! Little turquoise-haired girl, what do they want from me? We've come to collect you. But I'm not dead at all. Actually, I'm feeling great. Do you really feel better now? Yes, but it's not the medicine that's helping me. - No? Then what is? - You. Oh, dear girl with turquoise hair, I want to marry you. But how can I? I'm just a wooden puppet. You're just a lying, mischievous little wooden puppet. Yes, and you're so beautiful. Perhaps if you behaved like a good puppet, you could become a real child. Really? Please tell me how. I'd do anything to be close to you. The first thing you must do is go tell your father that you're alright. I promise I'll be a good puppet. I'll love my daddy and give him comfort. Then I can become a real boy, grow up and marry the turquoise-haired girl. I'll always be with her, but also with my dear father, of course. My ABC book! Hey wait, stop! Don't go! Stay still. The talking-twig doesn't realize that it was us. Ah, it's you. Hello, friends, what happened to you last night? What happened to us? We met up with some cruel villains and we defended our little friend, but our friend abandoned us like chumps in the middle of the woods. Oh, really? I'm sorry. You won't believe what happened to me. What's wrong with your paw? - My what? What's wrong with what? He fought like a hero against those vicious villains. Oh, friends, thank you. You needed something? We're on our way! I need my ABC book. What? Give us your money then. No, we don't want your money. You'll need it to buy a gift for your father. Regrettably, it will be a small, itty-bitty gift. But if in the alternatory, you made that money grow... You could buy him thousands of marvelous gifts. What a pity. Friends. YES? Could I ask you a favor? Absolutely! Quick! Here. - So? - The coins. Quick. Thanks. Now, you take a walk to town for at least an hour. When you return, your money tree will have sprouted. Thank you, friends. Soon, I'll be able to repay your kindness handsomely. No, absolutely not! We don't want payment. We like enrichifying nice people. Farewell, Pinocchio, we're off now. We have a world of good-deeds to do. Goodbye, friends. Thank you. What honest people! And what if I find two thousand coins instead of only one thousand? Ah, I'd buy a huge castle and fill the cellar with candy. Who'll he be? This woodpecker-puppet-boy in front of me Who strays, and spends his days so happy-go-luckily We'll see, who'll he be? Watch yourself, little fellow! Don't do things that are naughty or you'll see your nose... Take a look, little fellows! Ladies and gentlemen, don't miss this evening's fireworks display honoring the birth of Prince Coddleroy, the first son of our beloved Grand-Duke Archibald. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? - What time is it? - It's twelve o'clock. - Do you believe an hour has passed? An hour since when? Since an hour ago. Well yes, certainly. Thank you. Thank you so much! What are you laughing about? Haven't you figured it out yet? What? The Cat and the Fox came back, took your coins and ran away. Oh no, that isn't possible! And you seriously believed a tree full of money could grow from your coins? Have you ever seen such a tree? Holy moly! And when I returned to the Field of Wonders, not only was there no tree sprouting money, but I didn't even find the coins I had buried. For this reason, I ask you, Honorable Mr. Judge, to condemn the Cat and Fox. - What happened? - Your Honor, I was asking you to... - Yessir! - This poor devil was robbed of his golden coins. Take him and put him in jail. - What? I... Justice is served. Next. And it turns out your puppet-child Pinocchio is under arrest in the City of Catchfools, locked-up in the Dimwit Dungeons. Thank you, I must go now. Snake. Turquoise-haired girl! Open, Open! There once was a dream that wished to fly away It got lost in the rain and can no longer play No, no! Come on, jailbirds! Hit the road. And thank the Grand Duke who pardoned you! Guard, open up! Hey, I'm here, too. What do you want? I want to get out, too. I have to go see the girl with turquoise hair! I'm innocent! - You're innocent? - Yes. Then I can't free you. Only the guilty were pardoned. - Your Excellency! - What do you want? I'm guilty, I'm a dangerous criminal. Why didn't you say so? You're free. - Oh, honey. - I missed you so much. Dad! Finally you're back! I've been waiting so long for this day! Pinocchio, Pinocchio! My boy, I'm here. Pinocchio! Father, I'm home! Father, I'm back, where are you? I'll go to school, just like I promised you. And I'll be a good puppet, a good boy. A good puppet, a good boy... Good morning to you all. My name is Pinocchio. Look at that. It's a talking piece of wood which goes to school. Hey, my new chair has arrived. He's a silly blockhead! Pinocchio's a joke-io! Hey, Pinocchio the joke-io! What are you up to? Do you want to do something with us? We'll go into school together? School-schmool! Today we're going to the coast to see a huge shark. They say he's enormous. Holy-moly! Enormous? But what about school? - Go if you want. But today's a girls-only day at school. Joke's on you! Pinocchio the joke-io! Tomorrow we'll tell you how big the shark was. Hey, wait for me, I'm coming with you. Well, if Pinocchio is coming, then go get your binoculars. - As quick as lightening. Here, pass. I don't see any shark that's enormous. He must have gone out for breakfast. The Headmaster! See? You wanted to go to school, and instead the Headmaster has come to you. You're rotten, you called him! Stop it! We'll see what the Headmaster does to you on your first day of school. Get up and defend yourself. Arturo, I said get up! Stop fooling around, get up. - It was his fault! - Mr. Headmaster, hurry. Arturo isn't moving anymore. Arturo, Arturo, answer me! Gervaso, run and get the doctors, tell them to hurry because Arturo is unconscious! Sit, Alidoro. You're coming with us, puppet! - But I... - Get up. You're under arrest! - I didn't mean to... He started it. - Tell it to the judge. Forward, march! One, two. One, two. Mommy? Where am I? Come Alidoro! One, two. One, two. Ah, my poor legs. Pinocchio! Where are you, my poor little Pinocchio? Why are you so lazy? Pick it up, you hooligan puppet. You think that's picking it up? Come on, step lively. Let's go! Wait, stop in the name of the law! Help, I don't know how to swim! I don't care! Please, help me. I'm drowning! If I save you, will you stop chasing after me? Yes, I swear. Come on, Alidoro! Help! Oh, has the sea been kind? What fishes will I find? Dover sole's delicious Yummy, yummy, yummy! And Arctic char is nutritious Nummy, nummy, nummy! Mullet, grouper, speckled pollock, tuna, cod and walleye Barracuda, mackerel, flounder, herring, hammer-jaw Lobster, snapper, mahi mahi, barramundi, octopi A fish extravaganza! What strange fish are you? I'm not a fish. I'm a puppet. Ah, good, a puppet-fish. I've never tasted you before. Tasted me? Can't you see I'm not a fish? I speak with reason, just like you. You're right. You're a fish that speaks and reasons. So I'll let you decide: how do you want to be cooked? Fried or poached in red sauce? I don't want to be cooked. I want to go free. Are you joking? Do you think I'd pass up the chance to savor such a rare fish? A word of advice: fried in fat brings out all the flavor. No, help! Daddy, Cricket! Turquoise-haired girl! I can't end up like this! So, my friend, you must feel a little better now that you're cleaned up? That terrible green fisherman... Good evening. What a nice warm fire! Hey, what's wrong? See that puppet over there? He's really messed things up, and now... And now I can't go to school, I can't go home, the police are searching for me, my girlfriend is gone and my father has probably died of a broken heart. He's in a pickle! The situation doesn't sound great. It's terrible and it's all my fault. I tried to be good but look what happened. Hey, calm down. I know what you should do. I should jump into the fire and end it here. Out of the frying pan, into the fire. - Do you think you're funny? - Listen to me, Pinocchio. You have to fly the coop. One two, one two... Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye, Pinocchio. Now you go slow, Pigeon, and don't fly too high, but not too low either. And beware of hunters. Hold on! And once we reach the port, you have to stow away on a ship that takes you to countries where no policeman will come looking for you. - Where are these countries? - Faraway, beyond the sea. - What's wrong, Pinocchio? - Nothing. Bless you! And whereas said truant puppet made a shocking seaside attempt on young Arturo, he was apprehended. But he then deviously stole away, whereat obedient canine Alidoro joined the chase and tracked the assailant. With the subsequent return of same canine, and in consideration of the conspicuous nonappearance of said fugitive and given the salt-water-soaked-state of Alidoro's coat, we have concluded that Pinocchio must have attempted to escape by water, and thereafter succumbed to accidental drowning in the aforementioned sea. My poor son... - Be still, Alidoro. - Be good, Alidoro. Sit. What? This dog is intelligent. He seems to be saying no. Did you see that? No, what? The canine's gone crazy. No, he's trying to tell us something. Pinocchio is not dead. What is he trying to say now? What is he indicating? The sea. The puppet drowned in the sea. No, that's not so! Alidoro, sit. - Farewell, Pinocchio. - Good bye, Pigeon, thank you. Hi. Hi. Lampwick. I'm Pinocchio. Are you coming to Toyland too? Me? I really don't know where to go.

Toyland is hailing A life of pleasure, it's sure to come true! Do you see that? What? They're all donkeys. And they make Toyland work. Who cares? We're not donkeys. Lampwick, what are those ears? What ears? What are you talking about? What are these? What's on my head? Pinocchio, your ears. They're donkey ears! ' No! ' No! You, come here. Lampwick! You come with me. Lampwick! Sir, we've all become donkeys. That's right, now you have to work. Where are you sending me? To work with the circus. Aren't you happy? Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to meet the most astonishing, exotic, best-trained donkey that ever came into existence. Pinocchio, the amazing donkey! Come on, Pinocchio, say hello to the audience! Now walk. Trot, gallop- Stay still. Shame on you! This is what happens to donkeys who behave like jackasses. Help, help! Save me. Help! Holy moly. It's father! Father, father! It's me, Pinocchio! Daddy dearest, it's me. I'm here! - Pinocchio? - Daddy. - Pinocchio! Daddy! Dear, dear, father of mine! I've finally found you. From now on, I will never leave you. Never, ever, ever. Do my eyes deceive me or are you my son? Yes, it's you, my dear sweet Pinocchio. Now we are forever stuck in the dark, my Pinocchio. That was the last candle stub I had. Daddy, tell me a story. Long ago there was a king Who was lonesome on his own But he carved a little puppet-son and he began to sing About giants and ants And of travelling far and nigh Long ago there was a boy Who dreamed one day he would fly And once there was a father So loveless and so alone! But he carved his sweet Pinocchio And the child became his own And his heart sang day and night-time And the fishes danced the music of a loving father and son! Now I feel just like a king My dear son means everything. Long ago there was a king Now that king has everything... Oh, where was I? Then one stormy day, the father went to sea searching for his son. The weather was violent and a great wave washed the father from his boat. And almost as soon as he hit the water, the father was swallowed up in one gulp by a sea monster who was swimming by. And how did the father survive? Fortunately, that very same storm had also sunk a small cargo ship and the hungry sea monster had swallowed that, too. What? The whole thing? Yup, the whole thing! And in that little ship, father found meat, cookies and candles. But now that's all gone. Well then, father, now we must find a way to escape! Yes, but how? By sneaking out the sea monster's mouth and swimming home. - A fine idea, Pinocchio, but I don't know how to swim. - It doesn't matter, father! I'm a great swimmer. Get on my shoulders and I'll take you to shore. It's a fantasy. How can a little puppet, only forty inches tall, have the strength to carry me on his shoulders all the way to shore? You'll see father! But if it's written in the stars that we are not meant to make it, at least you and I will have the consolation of struggling together and hugging each other right to the end. Dearest father, do you see land? What land? No, I see only the ocean. Water... Father! Daddy,no! Daddy, hang on to me, c'mon! Don't worry, your son will take care of you. Yes, my son will take care of me. Father, can you see anything now? Can you see anything? Land,land! We're home, father! Help, Alidoro! Help! Pinocchio. - What's wrong Alidoro? - Bring the stick. What are you doing? - This is insubordination! - Come back! - Help, help. - Persevere, my son, he's coming. I can't per-se-vere any longer. Pinocchio, I'm here! I learned how to swim. Help me, my friend! Yes, grab on to my back! Please, save my father. - What about you? - I'll be alright. - Don't give up! - Persevere, son! Per-se-vere, per-se-vere. Pinocchio! Dear son, how are you this morning? - Oh, father, you're alive. Yes, and you are, too. I'm soft. I've become a boy! A real boy! Right now I feel like a king Every dream I've had has come true! My heart's learned to fly and sing And it's all because of you! My heart's learned to fly and sing And it's all because of you! I'm not a puppet anymore... I'm a boy with a dad I adore! And I adore you, my son! Come, Pinocchio, let's go out into the sunshine! - Pinocchio! - Pinocchio!
