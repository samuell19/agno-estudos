This is quite an aircraft going to land. Report to the commander. Going to land now. Robert, put it on. There it is. Attention control tower. 148 wishes to land and is on course 232 now. Passengers. Look. It's been blocked. That's another signal. The controls are blocked. S.O.S. 148. Answer! We're going down! Tangiers, the crash of a private airplane was reported in the Sahara desert this morning. On board, in addition to two pilots, was the noted physicist Professor Landersen and his son Robert. The cause of the crash is unknown. All are presumed dead, although the body of Robert Landersen has mysteriously disappeared. Moscow, the Russians formally announced today that they intend to send another man into space. The launching will be attempted next month. May 10th, Cape Canaveral. Mysterious explosion of a Titan rocket. May 10th, Atomgrad. Satellite lasted five minutes before planned launching. May 10th, Nevada. Mysterious fire completely destroys atomic installation. May 10th, London. British spacecraft in unexplained disaster. Gentlemen, our governments have ordered us to meet in order to solve the series of unexplainable disasters that have recently taken place. Even as I speak to you, we are fighting to control the enormous fire that has destroyed our Nevada installations. As you know, this was followed several hours later by explosions in Cape Canaveral and Atomgrad. The situation is most serious, and we must confront it together. I'll speak later. It's very plain to my country what it is. Sabotage. But what country would be interested in destroying weapons in America, and in the Soviet? Professor Miller. Now Washington has sent him down and I'd like you to hear him. Please. Gentlemen, I shall begin by showing you some films which have been dispatched to me from the National Security Agency, from the Soviet Secret Service and from our own intelligence department. Now this film was shot shortly before the explosion of May 10th at Cape Canaveral. Notice the man in the center. Atomgrad testing site in Russia, May 10th. As you can see, the same person. And now in Nevada, the same day, and the same man. In each one of the disasters which have occurred in the last few days, the respective security forces have noticed the presence of this individual, who after every one of the explosions vanished without leaving a trace. There's another baffling factor. Meanwhile, each one of the nation's top military commands was aware of some puzzling breakdown in its radar system. But even more fantastic, and listen well, each one of the scenes I have just run off showing the mysterious observer was filmed at those widely-separated missile sites on the same day. That is, not only on the same day, gentlemen, I would say not even hours, but minutes elapsed between the taking of those films I have just shown you. It's impossible for a man to travel distances like that in one day. It's absurd to think a human being... But is he human? Or is he supernatural? A thing of which we know nothing. Belonging to another planet? Nonsense. I agree it sounds crazy. Almost any theory might be considered. Right now we haven't got one logical explanation. I wanna show you just one scene. Sorry, you're all wrong. That was Robert Landersen, who was killed in a plane crash over the Sahara desert a few months ago, together with his father, the famous atomic scientist. But see here, the man in the picture is so like Robert. The resemblance might be only a coincidence. But when Professor Landersen's plane crashed, all radar receivers in the area were unexplainably knocked out. The same thing happened immediately before all the recent disasters. You think, then, there is a connection between the plane crash and the disasters in some way. Absolutely. I am convinced that the striking resemblance between our suspect and young Landersen is the key to the entire case. The danger persists unless he's captured, doesn't it? If you can get hold of his picture, you can get him. I'll warn the police now that... My dear general. We all have tremendous respect for your police efficiency, but our losses have been enormously expensive. It's evident the man has unknown weapons in his hands that are useless to fight against. We shall do whatever you want. Anything you suggest, Professor? First we must locate him. We must find out all we can about him. Exactly who he is, what purpose he has. Then maybe we can take some action. Yes, of course, but how? First, we must warn the security department of every known state. Set up a constant, worldwide control. It is most important that I be notified the minute this man is found, or that there is a radar breakdown anywhere. I shall instantly fly wherever necessary, and make every effort to solve the secret of this man's, this being's power. What's the mixture now, Cassoni? 3%, shall I add more? Surely. Be sure to go slowly. Stop it. Stop it. Before you get to 6%. This new combination now takes effect instantaneously. Cut the gas, and add the oxygen. Months of experiment, and finally we succeeded. Don't you know what a weapon we've got? Professor Borri, this gas is able to paralyze an entire city for two or three days. Good day, Professor. - Thank you. - Good day. - Hello Marina. - Hello. Waiting long? No. Be honest now, which do you need more? Your fiancee, or her car? Come on, Marina. I always need you. But my car's in the shop, you know that. Yes, I know. For a whole month. Yes, but to stay on your good side, I pay all your parking tickets. Where do you want to go? To the club. I have an appointment with Audrey. That crazy girl again. Yes, that's right. Well, all right. On to the club. Reporting unidentified aircraft proceeding north. Reporting unidentified aircraft proceeding north. What's this? It's blocked. Tell Lieutenant right away. Lieutenant, it's the same thing as yesterday, our radar's been interrupted. Are you sure? We were following a plane, trying to identify it, when suddenly it blocked. Hello, Control? Our screen's blocked again. Can you follow that plane? It's impossible, there's some strong magnetic interference. Our machines here show nothing. I see. Wait outside. Operator, let me talk to Major Michelotti. Emergency! Major Michelotti. Major Michelotti is wanted on the telephone. Oh. I'm sorry. Major Michelotti. You win. Then why the hurry? Why are you running off like this? War hasn't broken out, has it? Oh no no, I hope not. Pity, another disappointment. I really could've had him at my feet, but they always have another appointment. But Audrey, do you know who he is? No. But he's the only man I've seen here today that I could be interested in. Well, there's always tomorrow. Oh, I've shocked the professor now. Oh, I do beg your pardon. Ah, but then all your biology study should've made you realize there is such a thing as sex, don't you think so? We're not in the laboratory. Go on defending your man no matter what, Marina, and keep saying the professor is right. You have quite a surprise in store for you, dear. You're liable to spend your honeymoon contemplating the bees anyway. I'm going, it's late. Wait a little, dear. I'll take you back. No, I better take a taxi. Audrey, give up the gin. Alcohol's killed off better painters than you. That's biological. Yes. Yes, well I'll come immediately. - But... - Taxi. Quickly, to the Ministry of Defense. Hey, hold it. Please. Did you ask me for my portrait? I've got no use for it. I'm Audrey Bradbury. Sometimes it happens that a person's face inspires a portrait. Not of me. It's the police, we should get out of here. It's better not to get mixed up in these things. Now tell me what they call you. My name's Bronco. Slavic? Yes, originally. But that's all in the past. You haven't seen me before today. No. I wouldn't forget if I had. I rarely meet anyone as special as you. Your eyes have a mystery I want to unravel. I want to find out why it is you're afraid. In bed, of course. I had to get you to go along. Getting models like you isn't easy. So I put on a wash of cerulean blue and thought it was a seascape. - Hello. - Hello. Hello there. She certainly knows how to pick them. Come on. Why do you say that? Here we are, Bronco. Let's go up to the studio. We can't afford the taxes, eh? Third time this month. Yeah, sure, and the same policeman picking us up because we don't pay protection. You keep on, you know where you'll end up. But that's honest work I have with an English painter. She thinks I'm extraordinary. That's what we all are, models. What do you think? She models every day. I'd like to see some of her poses. It's a good thing she wears clothes. Wait a minute, I'll show you. I want you to take a look. Here's some of the papers that she draws on. See? Just like she told you. But this one isn't you. That's a man. Here. Ah, he was just standing there today. He went off with the painter when they were raiding the street. Take 'em away. Come on, madame. If located, notify police headquarters immediately. Captain Carloni. This man is dangerous. Operator, get me extension 26, Captain Carloni. I'll put you through right away. Captain, the telephone. Hello, Captain Carloni, headquarters speaking. The vice squad? What's this about? Just a minute. A painter, Audrey Bradbury. No, no, you'd better leave it to us. We'll look into it, thank you. Thank you. It was about our man, I think it's worth looking into. I must say, I can't believe it. Anyway, call Captain Clark, US Embassy. Yes sir. Carbonelli, come in here to me. Captain. Send out the alarm. Alert all districts. Yes sir. I want Captain Clark. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Viamaguda 23. Your men will be stationed in the center of the city? I'll be there. Jack? The telecamera and transistor. Viamaguda 23. Sir, is that it? Yes, thank you. The child of the ocean. Or a portrait to reveal your feelings. I imagine it that only in her jade eyes was there a world as mysterious as I see in yours. But not now. There it is. Don't you feel it? I have the title for your portrait. Bronco, man of many mysteries. And I'm determined to unlock and solve all those mysteries. Who was it today who called the police? The black marketeers gather at that place near the river and it always happens. Tell me, what Earth do you inhabit? Never had a drop of whiskey, never heard of the black market and police? And even after I've told you, I never see a change on your face. I must know your mystery. I just need more time. But time's precious for me, you know. Who is that? That's Marina. She's engaged to Professor Borri, a scientist. Scientist? Are you interested in the model or the artist? In her. Marina? Is she married? Pretty, rich, and wouldn't appeal to you. To Borri. No, Borri's her fiance. You surprised? Look, I'm invited to a big party tonight, and I know that she's coming. Do you want to go out? Only I'm determined to save you for myself. You'll bring me? Certainly. Except you're not going to escape me. Let's go. I want you to meet our new butlers. This is Fulco and this is Vicenzo. Now don't steal them like you did the others. Of course not darling, we'll behave like angels. Tell me, what do you think of the new man Audrey brought tonight? I must say he looks like something Vidalli dreamed up. Too spooky. Don't play the intellectual. You really don't do it well, darling. As a model he's interesting, but as a man - I couldn't judge. - How do you say that? I haven't met him yet. I'd like to know what Audrey thinks. Extraordinary. Inconceivable. Just marvelous. Well, you might take me over and introduce me. I'm curious. Bronco. I'd like you to meet a friend. Looking over the pool, huh? I had it constructed this year instead of getting myself a new mink. Better than that. I see. But wasn't that good? I don't know much about minks. What are they? - I couldn't see... - Hello Marina. Hello friends. - Anybody see Audrey? - Over there. I want my portrait, show me my portrait, it's me and I must have it. Art belongs to all, and even if it is your portrait, you've no rights. I see. I must find minks to convince you. - It's so nice. - Hello. You look marvelous tonight, Marina. I'm Marina Ferri. Don't pay attention to Audrey. Of all the women I know, she's the most dangerous. Unless you can dominate her. And I must say, I think you're just the man. This might turn out a nice evening. You know, you really shouldn't mind Marina. She's mad tonight. Going to test the water of the pool now, absolutely naked. One catch though, no line. Oh, fun, hurry, hurry. This is something to see. Now come on darling, drama. Oh come on now, take your clothes off. So cheap. You mustn't talk like that. It makes you into a bloody bourgeois, doesn't it darling? I didn't hear what your name was. Was it Dracula? It wasn't mentioned. But anyway, it's Bronco. Now what do you say? I'm hardly enchanted. Let's get out. What about Audrey? She doesn't matter. Take this, now. That's him. That's our man. They're just a bunch of petty snobs, don't you agree? Where are we going? I thought the party was boring and I'd rather be here with you. Or Professor Giorgio Borri? Is that all we can talk about? Sorry. I thought you'd be interested in his experiments since you're engaged to him. Don't you realize that he's attempting to use people in his experiment? To paralyze man's willpower? I have also tried this. Where is he? Take me to him. I must see him. Take me to where he is. Then you must forget. You must forget all of this. Why do the swans act strangely? I don't know. Is that what they are? Swans? It must be very late. Come on, come on, quickly. All right, we're going right now. Don't get angry. I'll take you home and then I'll get some sleep. Operator number one calling central police security and step on it. Come in number one. Julietta spider, 46628, now departing Villaborgasi heading towards Porta Pinchana. You keep on them, huh? Further orders will be issued. Make sure you're in contact. Major, this is urgent. Will you step in here, Bob? Yes? These are the orders to capture our man. Set up controls and I want you to supervise the whole thing. Yes sir. I'll be there with you as soon as possible. Yes, very well. But don't wait for me. Oh, keep in touch with us and don't take any chances, will you? I won't. Please stay right where you are. I must ask you and the lady to come along with me to the police commissioner. It's just a matter of questioning. What is it?! The doctor, quickly. Hold it, don't chase that man! He mustn't be touched. It may be very dangerous. I'll go after him. Stay away! He never had a chance. The man with the Geiger counter's ascertained that there was lots of radiation. The way I see it, that monster killed our man with a touch of his hand without the slightest trouble. The man's radioactive. We never should've tried to arrest him, that was my mistake. What are we going to do, sit around and wait for orders? Not at all. We must stay close to him. We must be alert to anything that happens. Organize a police surveillance so that this man is under constant watch. But why is he in Rome? And what has Professor Borri's young lady to do with this case? After all, he's not concerned, Borri is. The fact is that that poor girl is in constant danger from that maniac. We must do something to save her, Major. What can we do? After what happened, we can't take any more chances. If we make another mistake, it could very well cause a catastrophe. They said to bring radiation suits, sir. Put it up here. The girl looks strange, doesn't she? This whole affair is a terrible menace to everybody in the world. Yes. It's much too serious for any one force to handle alone. They have reported this last event to the British Secret Service, and we're awaiting their instructions. I hope these things work. - Supposed to. - Yes, he's right here. Major Michelotti, the Secret Service and the Ministry of Defense informs us that all radar installations in our zone have been blocked, and General Rossi wants to talk to you. Hello sir, the major is on the way. Michelotti, General. You've spoken to the US Air Force. And they advise us to keep him under surveillance without taking him in. Very well, sir. At last they finally stopped. He's getting out. He's letting her escape. Hello handsome, listen, got a match? Guess it's an important case, huh? Up all night just tailing the guy. Slow up a bit. Hello Audrey. Where did you and he go? We just went for a drive. I can hardly remember where. He's really a very strange man. Is he with you? I dropped him near the river. You dropped him? That's right. Oh, I know where he is, then. You shouldn't have left me, Marina. After all, Stefano tried to take me somewhere. Well that's natural. I'm tired, come on home. Listen. Must be the... Hello, police security patrol. Don't worry, Captain, we're keeping on top of him every minute. When are you free? I don't know. I will see you again. Perhaps in a few days? But my time here is short. Why? I'm going away again. Well, how's Thursday? That's too late. Well, it's too late tonight. I can't recall much of what's happened this evening. Only confused impressions, like after you've been dreaming a horrible nightmare. How can you explain that? Perhaps I'll explain when we meet again. Are you sure we will? Really, I mustn't see you. You have to. Oh, all right. Tomorrow morning. Near the river where I left you. Good night. Who's she? Doesn't matter. - Hey, not bad. - Hey, look! Bronco. I never thought I'd find you. What are you doing here? Psst, hey, come here baby. I'm coming, now what? Want a ride? All right, let's go. Just hang around. About 10 minutes? - Don't go away. - Hey, wait a second. I'm in a hurry! Bronco, answer me, don't look at me like that. Wait. I've been walking up and down the street for hours wondering where you were. Please don't be like this, please. Excuse me, I am not Bronco. But you are, you must... But you must be Bronco. Give him a minute, then follow him. Bronco! Just a second. Isn't that... Damn. Must be two of them. Twins? What do we do? We'd better call headquarters. Car 223 calling headquarters. Car 223 calling headquarters. Hello, this is urgent. Bronco. I guess I drank a little too much. But that other man looked just like you. But that doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is now, and that at last I was able to find you and that you're here alone with me. Bronco. Now who's that over there? You have got to go. You can't stay on the bed. I don't know who he is. He'll be a new friend, isn't that enough? Even though he runs off with... Marina belongs to Professor Borri, you know. But the whole thing was still my fault. Come and kiss me. Please, Bronco. - Welcome Professor Miller. - Glad to see you. May I present General Rossi? This is certainly a great pleasure, Professor. How do you do. The others are waiting. It's very good of you to come to meet me. That the painter was murdered is definite. But which one was responsible? At least we know now there are two, and maybe even more of these incredible creatures. Of course, this explains the simultaneous appearance of what we thought was one man in such widely separated places. Now let us consider again the odd circumstances surrounding Landersen. I do have a theory. Are you still on Landersen? But I can't see what he had to do with this. Because I can prove it. Professor Miller, I know your theory. Science has gone so far in the laboratory, they can take human beings and reproduce them. So overdeveloped science could overcome death too. Perhaps, but that isn't precisely what I have in mind. In my viewpoint, we're confronted by beings from another planet. You mean outer space is invading us, is that it? To keep men from reaching into space. That explains our rocket installations being demolished. But how many do you think there are down here, to complete their evil work? Two, 20, 1000, why not, and then a million? They send them down when they want to. What are we going to do about that? We must see they're destroyed, and we must warn the people at once. Apprising the whole population of this would be sure to set off a panic that would be of no help. I'm positive the whole thing should be kept absolutely secret, no matter what the results. Gentlemen, has it ever occurred to any of you that the mere fact that this creature has shown an interest in the gas formula of Professor Borri might be of help to us? What if we were to get him down to the research institute and examine him there without his knowing it? That's much too dangerous. Just suppose he should get hold of the gas. We must take that risk. It's the only possibility I can see to solve this mystery and work out a plan in defense of humanity. By producing this new type of gas in great quantity, we could actually paralyze the entire population of a city for two or three days. Do you recognize this man? Here. Take a look. No. Who is he? I've never seen him. Oh, he's interested in the work you're doing, Professor. You mean, a spy? Well, we might say that. And I, what should I do? We're certain that this man is going to try to contact you, and you must help us to carry out this plan. Now... And when was the last time you saw Audrey? That night at the party. And you were there. She was so drunk it was unpleasant. Basically though she was nice. She liked you a lot, did you know that? It seemed that she was infatuated. Infatuated with me, you mean? She wanted an affair. My, respect the poor girl, but you didn't have the affair. Audrey knew more than was good for her. She wanted the thrill of the unknown. Oh yes, absolutely. There, that's better. What do you mean? Why do you say that? I don't know. We're becoming good friends, it seems to me. And I must say I'm glad. Are most girls like you? What do you mean? What I mean is, your shape is very beautiful. My shape? What a funny way to talk. My shape? I must say, you keep surprising me. I don't think there is anyone else like me. And if a girl did exactly resemble me, I'd change myself. Hey. Don't be like every other man when he's all alone with a girl, it's not nice. Go on. I'd like you to tell me why you wanted to see me again, Bronco. Go ahead. But it's hard to explain. Let's talk about you. What were you like as a baby? I don't know. I can't remember being a child ever. Just a second. Let me see. There. Here's the money. Somehow I don't know just what you're like. Sometimes you're ingenuous, then mysterious. Now I know your secret. You're a baby. And here's a nice toy, go ahead. I won, I won, I won! No. Go on, go on. Hurry up, get in. Let's stop down here. Bronco. What are you looking at? With you they could bring a fresh spirit to the Earth, and restore the world to a new state. What does that mean? An invitation to romance? I'm engaged, don't forget that. I was asking about you. I tell you I'm not human. Don't say that. You know you shouldn't. What you know about me. It's best not to ask, please. You're not human, eh? Well we'll see, all right? Your lips, they're like ice. Your gesture was quite moving. I guess it is a primitive sign of affection. I have the power to judge you. You people of this puny world move swiftly towards your own destruction. You still fail to understand, even after thousands of years, what a magnificent gift life is. Your planet, all of nature with its own delightful mysteries. Consider the world from which I have come. The shapeless creatures who live in it, but who in ages past were also men and women, each of them unique and precious even as you. Those men too made the foolish mistakes that you are now repeating. All science was theirs, and they conquered all secrets which preserve the harmony of nature. Now, you must forget. Wake up. Do you feel badly? I was stupid to talk so much. I was neglecting my mission, and time is running out. I can't betray them. I can hear you, speak. You are going to help me. My mission is to help those beings in some other place. I must do it, I must. Will you take me to Giorgio Borri? Take you to Giorgio Borri. Come on. It's Marina. Listen to me, Giorgio. Someone here and I want to ask you... Well, have him come up. But do you feel all right? I'm going home and take a rest. Will you ring me up later? Yes, I'll be all right. Yes Giorgio, I must go now. There, it's done. Giorgio expects you, but I'm feeling strange. I feel a beginning of a cold and my head aches. I must go home. Don't touch her. Go and call an ambulance. Be sure to get them to come here at once with anti-radiation equipment. Almost every day now, new discoveries are being made, which explain problems which had been unsolved mysteries the day before. In time, undoubtedly, man will learn to master all of nature, the good, the bad. And then mortality. But then what happens to him? All men are overconfident. They disturb the harmony of the world without knowing the mistakes they can make. You've no faith in them, in mankind? They only value themselves as humans. They don't realize the infinite realm of science. Please. They're going toward the x-ray room. I can just see them. Come over here. Here they are. Our newest laboratory, where we carry out extensive experiments in radioactivity. Humanity is so tired. Its nerves are broken and its equilibrium is unbalanced. Perhaps all of mankind should have a long sleep, a rest. You mean by the use of your gas, Doctor, is that possible? No, not exactly. The effect of my gas is much lighter. It wouldn't last that long. If used on a man, it would not be dangerous, it would rob him of powers to act and speak. Yes, I think so. What is the formula of this gas? Answer me. Why is it taking so long? It's done now, sir. Someone is spying. X-rays have penetrated this room. But no no no, it's normal, it's our procedure. It's just that there's a radioscope in there. If you like, there's another very interesting room. Come with me down here. That's him. Here are the results of my deception. We now have an x-ray of our weird adversary. A well-defined skeleton made of some metallic substance, possibly steel. Only one lung, clearly artificial. Total absence of any kind of heart whatsoever. All this confirms my theory. They are all robots, made in a resemblance of Landersen's son. Gentlemen, they're not human, they're something supernatural, and an enormous force of destruction. That explains it, doesn't it Major? We must find the source of its power, or it may destroy us all. Isn't that so, General? At any price, you must. Captain Carlini, urgent, they're calling you from the hospital. Yes? What is it? Suspected radiation? I'll be right there. The girl has gone into a coma. Let's go together. That girl can undoubtedly be of help, even now. Get the injection, quickly, and remove the shield. And call Professor Demates. The injection's ready, Doctor. No visitors. Captain Carloni, police. Her heartbeat, Inspector. What happened to you out there? Your lips are like ice, Bronco. Please say you're human, Bronco. Well, I don't know. Professor, Professor. Professor, can you save her? Sometimes there is a miracle, but in this case I'm sure her memory's gone. I don't think we can save her memory. Let's hope she may forget whatever she imagines she has seen. That might be better. Marina. Tell us of Bronco. What is Bronco's world like? What did you discover? Bronco. Who? On one of the distant and unidentified planets, some incalculable and unrestrained scientific power has violated the divine balance that governs the laws of nature. This power begins to create numberless, frightful human beings, of which so far we can only know the vaguest examples. Raise the screen, please. Wait outside. There we are. We observed, for instance, the phenomenon caused by the atomic explosions on Hiroshima during the last war. These deformed beings required a new environment, one uncontaminated by poisonous radiation. Today we have only a general idea of the creatures who live on that mysterious planet, but the Earth is for them a marvelous, virginal place where they can still save themselves. For this reason they have transformed some of them into creatures resembling human beings, and they have entrusted each one of them with specific missions, in order to make ready their preparations for their mass migration to Earth. They must be far ahead of us, mustn't they? In the nuclear area. Undoubtedly. But they refrain from their use, lest they turn the Earth into a planet of monsters. Gentlemen, let me try to describe for you what I believe happened. We have to return to the hour when one of their planes forced Landersen's down on the Sahara, as it headed for the Tangiers airport. We can never know for sure just what their plane looked like or the weapons it used, as the Landersens' plane was completely demolished. But one thing is certain. Young Robert Landersen was on that plane when it went down, and as you can recall, his body was never found, which leads me to believe that it served as the model from which the creatures who are now invading our planet were formed. Probably they have developed a scientific laboratory of which we could only have the vaguest idea. But owing to their superior scientific and technological knowledge, they have been able to recreate such beings. Either out of a pliable metal or other mysterious substance, they've developed a material that appears to function as human epidermis. Out of their seemingly unlimited knowledge, they install an oversized brain into this robot, ready to carry out their orders. Today, we are confronted by these creatures, who seem like men to us, but are in reality machines of extraordinary intelligence which pose an enormous threat to our entire civilization, both material and spiritual. Watch it, there he is. Where is he? He disappeared. Disappeared? Turn back. Car number five reporting. Major Michelotti, we've lost contact. But how could they have lost contact? We can't find him, he's disappeared. What can they do? Is it blocked again? Post eight, post eight, point 10A calling. Sighting large unknown object. Well no, our radar is blocked. Last observed moving southwest toward Lazio. Will you call back? Well then I'm pulling out. Yes we will. Thank you. Bronco was last seen at Professor Borri's. Stayed there only a few minutes, but the professor can't remember a word he said. He seemed to want Marina. And the agents who were to follow? They lost Bronco. The men say he disappeared. And the assistant to Borri? Disintegrated. The professor said that lying on the floor were Bronco's gloves. Good lord, do you suppose he's taken the gas formula away from Professor Borri? We will soon see. There's one thing we must do. Track him down no matter where he is. And no matter how many men it costs. I better telephone to Washington. Major Michelotti, institute plan X immediately. Yes General. But why was he searching for Marina? He must be in love with her. It's a strange love. Attention, attention. All cars assigned to police headquarters prepare for plan X, emergency. Prepare for plan X, emergency! Everything set? Plan X, emergency, going into affect immediately. This is an emergency. Come on, hurry up, let's get going. All cars assigned to police headquarters, effectuate plan X. May I see your papers, please? What's going on? Sergeant, anything come in yet? No, nothing yet, Major. Control tower number four to security headquarters. Control tower number four to security headquarters. A civilian pilot reports an unidentified flying object he has spotted near Castelle Delava. It was impossible to pursue it, as his plane began to lose altitude for some unknown reason. Wouldn't you know it? And our squadron is patrolling another zone. Listen Major, I'll pick up some men and get out to Catelle Dalava. - Right. - Be careful. Air Force extension one. Michelotti here. Cheer up, kids. You're almost home. I'll drop you off and then... Car five calling security headquarters. Hello, hello. The man is right here. In front of the medical clinic. Nothing I can do. I've got two kids with me. Hey, who's that? Hide. Down, get down. Don't move. Car number five, answer. What the devil's happened? - I've got you. - I got you. Escape, it's the police, go on! It's a police car, go on! Armed, stop. I'm sorry sir, move ahead. A security headquarters car. Around here's where it'd be. I don't see anything. Neither do I. I'd swear that was Bronco. Quick, follow him. Driver, stay at this distance. Right sir. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It's impossible, that man was in here. Use your camera. Use your camera! That's all that remains of Bronco, Major Michelotti. What is it? Metal, that's all. A mass of metal. Anything else? Just a moment, I'll look. Here's something. I found this object. What is it? A souvenir of St. Peter's. Can you see it? That's all that's left. What is it? They're making a movie over there. They're always getting in the way. The formula of the gas is all right, don't you think so? And so our battle is finished. No, gentlemen, Bronco is finished, but our struggle has only begun. Other terrifying beings, not much different from Bronco, are all watching, lurking, prowling, observing us from dark places. Cleverly hidden among the careless throngs of every cities in different population, and they are powerful, ruthless, maniacal. Yes, it's a dreadful, menacing, but silent invasion. Even at this moment, this very second, there may be one of these monsters right next to you, watching, watching, about to destroy you now.
