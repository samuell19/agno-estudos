Okay, which is fine except it takes out all the nutrients. Like that, see? I'm thinking about cross breeding a strain of wheat that already has a white hull. That way you make pastry flour or dough or whatever from it, or dough or whatever from it, and it'd still be a whole grain. Massive financial upside. And you might get your face on a bag of flour, too. Of course. Carter, that would be real good. Well, what are you going to do with your money? You going to get yourself some whores? I'm believe I'll get myself a harley and find some Korean whores. Move it, Ben. Okay. For your information, smartass, I just might start my own fortune 500 company. You're sure dressed for it today.

The kid's a rube, and Carter and Jack are getting too wise to my operations. Maybe I ought to get rid of them all. Tough to lose Carter, though. Mr. green thumb. Mr. green thumb. And Jack-- I used to think he had management potential, but I'm afraid he's lost the hunger. Nobody would miss them. What the fuck, man? Who knows? Maybe they'll disappear on their own. Stranger things have happened. Have a good night? Nothing wrong with a little celebration, right? Sierra kahan knows something. What? What could she know? She said something about Malcolm learning his lesson. She said something about Malcolm learning his lesson. You think she was in on the murder? No, that wouldn't make sense. She's more into nonviolence than anybody. I don't know. Just gave me a weird feeling. You know? Man, would you look at all this fucking beautiful footwear. Hey! Shit! Shit. They're here. What? Who? Come on. They're coming up the back road. What are you talking about? Who's here? It's the cops. It's a bust. It's the cops. It's a bust. The cops. What? The hired guys have already run off. Let's go. Can't believe this shit. We paid them. I paid them. Maybe you didn't pay them enough. Then why did he invite me to his goddamn nephew's carousel play? Then why did he invite me to his goddamn nephew's carousel play? Shit, where's the... This is just totally fucked. Goddamnit, I paid them. I paid all of them. Let's go. Hurry. Here, let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Jesus Christ, they must think we left already. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for? Just calm down, Harlan. You're coming too fast. Yeah. Yeah, those are not cops. They're rippers. Rip-off artists? How can you tell? Look at their tennis shoes. What do we do? Oh, shit. Wait a sec, guys. They got guns, too. You know? Let's let them have what's left. We got enough at Lucy's. You got enough at Lucy's. All I'm saying is, Carter, all I'm saying is, Carter, I don't want to die for a bunch of dope. That's stupid. We fight for what's ours, Harlan. That's the way. You don't want to fight? Fine. You get nothing. But you get in my way, I'll kill you myself. You wouldn't dare. Oh, wouldn't I? Why don't you try me? Why don't you try me, you little fucking coward? Harlan, you don't dare somebody to kill you. Jack, fucking Ben up there! He's their spy, man. You guys just stay back! Fuck you! Guy in the red. Got 'em now, guys! There are only three of them, and they're right below me. Great, Ben! Did you get the asshole in the bathrobe? Fucking Ben. Yeah, I think so. Hey, the guy in the red coat, he's behind that log. Cover me! Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit. Jack! No! Hey, you all right? Go on, you fucks! Go on, you fucks! Where's Harlan? I'm so sorry. Jesus, I'm sorry, man. I told you he was a ripper. I'm so sorry. What do you mean, you're sorry? This motherfucker, we save his life, he steals one of our goddamn guns, then tries to ambush us. What do you mean, you're sorry? What do you mean, you're sorry? Motherfucker. Stop it, man. What are you doing? Well, how bad is it? He's losing blood. Here. I can't believe I did this. I just-- What are we going to do? Sorry. Well, I can't stop this bleeding. We gotta do fucking something. Shut up. We gotta do something! Shut up! There's only one thing to do. Moose. A moose. Yeah. A moose? Yeah, a moose, but we missed him. I think probably what happened is a bullet ricocheted off an antler or something. Does he have insurance? Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, it's-- I'm sure he does. Right there. Oh, and you may want to contact his wife. Oh, and you may want to contact his wife. Is there anything else you need me for? You can sign right here. Right there. Okay, signature, right? Okay. Uh... You did what? I didn't know what name to use. Okay? I didn't know what name to use. Okay? You didn't know what name-- What if they go up there and look around now? They're not going to go up there and look around because the guy's a ripper, and he's going to cover his ass. And they're doctors. Okay? Are you kidding? You're fucking delusional. You guys are smoking too much. You're going to have to stop smoking this shit until we're finished with this thing. Oh, you're real clear headed, huh? You're not fucking up at all. Are you? Malcolm. You weren't in any hunting accident, Ben. You know that. Hell, I know it. You know that. Hell, I know it. And how you know I know it because I just told you. Now, understand I'm not one of your local candy-ass cops, so you can keep on lying to me, in which case you're going to receive the worst medical treatment this side of Indonesia. Or you can open your mouth and let all them pretty little beans just spill on out. Yes, this is Malcolm stockman. Could you send roses to my mother, please? Could you send roses to my mother, please? Yes, the regular. Good. And the card should read, "to my darling mother, "I adore you as always. Your incorrigible son, Mel." Thank you. Malcolm. Hey, it's Christina, the babysitter. It looks like the sheriff's got some information about your case. I didn't get to overhear everything, but it seems like they're moving pretty quick. You can call me here if you want. And maybe I can see you again sometime. And maybe I can see you again sometime. 3:00 A.M., fucked up. And it's not the weed this time. Really. Really. It's the dreams, bad ones, the growers versus gianni. Are they closing in? I should protect my back, though, to tell the truth, I haven't. To tell the truth I haven't. I'm up on the hire wire, mama, without a net. Holy shit, Jack. I've been trying like crazy to reach Malcolm, man. What happened? There's a whole platoon of cops, deputies-- Oh, shit. And they just gassed up, man, and I think it's a bust for sure, man. I think it's your place because I was looking, man, you know, with what he's paying me, man. You know, with what he's paying me, man. I'm like-- I'm on-- I got my eyes on the prize, man. Headed north, putting out fires, while Rome burns, etc., etc. Were there really fiddlers then, or was that just some opposition party's propaganda to discredit nero? What was that experience? From innocence to experience, innocence to cynicism, then back to innocence again. Baudelaire, yeah. Fleur de mal. Mal. Malcolm. That's me, babe. Mal. Malcolm. That's me, babe. Out of the shit, comes a flower. There it is again. Fuck you. Fuck you. All right? I don't hear anything, I don't see anything, and I'm not stopping every 15 fucking seconds for you to have a psychotic fucking episode. Now, come on. Jesus. Come on. What are you doing now? Oh. I thought we were going to try to quit? Just a few puffs. Just a few puffs. A few puffs of this shit makes you hear shit and see shit. Now, put it away. Goddamnit, put it away. Come on, Carter. Sorry. I'm sorry. You son of a bitch. I didn't mean to hit you. I'm sick of your shit, you fucking hippie! I'm sick of this! Get the fuck off me, man. You shit pile. Shit, come here. Huh? Fuck with me? Huh? Come here. Huh? Huh? Cut it out! Hey, it's real this time. What? It's real. Go! Go! Go! Come on. Fan out. Scotty, Mike. Don't touch anything. There might be evidence. Yeah, in a pig's ass. Ro-pan international. Leave a message. This is gianni again. Call me back within 24 hours. Do you understand me? Just kept kicking you? Yeah. First he slapped me. And then I slapped him back. And then he went insane, just hitting me and kicking me, and he wouldn't stop. For no reason. Yeah. You know, if it was about you, I'd understand completely, I'd understand completely, but he's with Heather, and she's supposed to be the best fuck around, and-- I don't mean you're not, Lucy. Nobody's sexier than you. Nobody. You know that, right? At least nobody I ever met. I had this idea that maybe you and I could go away together, you know, just the two of us. Yeah. Hello? Jack! Hello. Malcolm? Yes. We want a meeting tonight. Uh, well, I'm afraid that's out of the question. I have three other meetings tonight. Cancel them. We're not screwing around here, Malcolm. In that case, I'll send my assistant, Jack marsten. He-- In that case, I'll send my assistant, Jack marsten. He-- No. No, I'll see you 10:00 P.M. behind the constance building. Alone. Hello? So? Everything's cool. So you're positive we should do this. The way that guy sounded on the phone, the worst possible thing we could do would be to ignore him. Do you know you're acting exactly like Malcolm? What's wrong with that? Nothing. It's just kind of creepy. Well, if I'm acting like Malcolm and all, you should be grateful. Malcolm got himself killed. You remember that? You remember that? I just think we should stop and think about this. I have thought about it, and I agree with myself. Look, if you don't want to go, I'll go alone. What do you mean? I mean you back down the alley and wait for me. Should we figure out some kind of time thing or something. Son of a bitch, man. Hold on. Sit. I believe in what you're saying. What the fuck is that? Malcolm? Johnny? Johnny? No, it's with a "g," two "I"s, two "n"s. It's gianni. Of course it is. I knew that. I just started off with a little joke there. It's good to-- Good to finally meet you. I was afraid you might not come. I was going to have to find your brother. Well, no, there's no need for that. It's a nice place you got. Yeah, it's a toy factory. Yeah, it's a toy factory. I got kids and grandkids. They pop out of the shoot so fast, I can't keep count of them. I give them stuff. Oh, yeah? Hey, Malcolm, is the harvest complete? Almost. I'm sorry I haven't called, but I've been out of town. There will be 1500 pounds, like we agreed? Absolutely. The only thing is it's not going to be exactly as soon as I expected. You told us it would be on the fourth. You told us it would be on the fourth. Why, that's tomorrow. Isn't it? Yeah, that's-- That's tomorrow. Yeah. The thing is that you just can't-- You can't predict how things are going to grow. You know? It's just-- Why don't you stand up? What's that? Help him stand up. Why-- why would I-- What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? What's the deal? What am I going to do with you, Malcolm? I'm just here doing business. You have any ideas? How about I bash in your fucking brains with a sledgehammer? How would you like that? What did I do? How about I cut your fucking balls off and feed them to my dog? He's had testicles. He loves them. He's crazy about them, Malcolm. Now, wait. I'm picking something up here. You don't believe me. Do you? You think I'm not going to do this. No, look. I believe you. I'm just saying I don't-- Pull his pants down. I don't understand why-- Pull his pants down. I don't understand why-- Pull his fucking pants down! How many times do I have to tell you shit? You idiots! Why would you want them to pull my pants down? Fuck! I want him to see his balls. I want the dog to see his balls. Where's the dog? Go get the dog. Get the fucking dog. I'm sure we can work something out. Goddamnit! Shit, man! Maybe we should just talk-- If we lose that dog, my wife's going to have-- shut up. What? You know, you cheated me. You lied to me. I gave you $2 million, and I got you into Hawaii and I got you into Hawaii because I want to be into northern California. I appreciate that. I really-- shut up! Let me assure you of something. Are you trying to take advantage of me? No, absolutely not. Good. You're going to be prompt with your delivery? Next week, I promise. I guarantee you. Believe me, next week. Okay? Cross your heart? Yeah, cross my heart. Whatever. Yeah, cross my heart. Whatever. Pull up your pants, man. Okay. You're a nice guy. I like you. Thanks. Fucking dog. Get him-- get him some grappa. Will you? Yes, sir. What's that? You want a toy, something to bring home? What? I don't really have any kids. Maybe we have one of those barking dogs left, kind of a memento. Here you go, sir. Here you go, sir. The mafia? Apparently Malcolm gave them the whole crop so he could get into Hawaii. Well, fuck me, man. They're the ones who killed him. They think he's still alive. They think I'm him. Then they're going to kill you. They just want the crop, Carter. They're going to kill somebody, man. That's what the mafia fucking does, is they kill people. Everybody kills people. Well, the mafia's really good at it. All right? I mean, if they want the crop, we're fucked, Jack. They expect it next week. By then we can have our money from Danny by then we can have our money from Danny and be way the fuck out of the country. I don't know, man. I know you don't know. That's why I'm telling you. Oh, look at that shit, man. Would you look at that? Shit. Fuck shit. I don't see anything. Exactly. All right? Exactly. Are you going nuts or something? Good night, fellas. Get down. Get down. Get up, Harlan. It's nothing. I thought I saw something. Jesus Christ, man. What's going on? Nothing. Lucy says it's not the outside people we got to worry about. What is that supposed to mean? Well, it's just more likely well, it's just more likely somebody on the inside just offs everybody else and... Harlan, that's a real smart thing to say right now. Sorry. Oh, god. Hey. What? Hey. What? I'm just going to take a piss, man. Enough. Enough, damn it. Uh, uh, sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. I was just leaving. Lucy, I don't think we're going to make it. Too many people are after us and I just want you to know that... I love you. We're going to be fine. Silence. Come on, man. Now, where's Malcolm? We don't know. He's dead-- he's dead, man. You're lying. Where's the body? Please. Where's the body? God, I don't know. Okay, there he is. The face. Finished? Lie down! Come on, man-- Right now! Please. Lie down! No! Hey. Get the fuck off me, man! Come on, man. Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! No! Oh, god, help me! Get the fuck off her, man. Motherfucker! Fuck you! Do you know who I am? You're the fucking helicopter pilot. I swear we didn't see anything. If you ever talk to gianni soletsko again except to break the fucking deal, except to break the fucking deal, I will personally and not because I've been hired, but for my own pleasure, bring you back to these woods, shoot you in the fucking stomachs, and bury you alive because we don't want out seed poisoned by mafia fucks! Is that clear? Yeah. Is that clear? Yes! Yes, it's fucking clear. You all right? You all right? You? My fucking god. You shut up! Shut the fuck up! - My feet hurt. - Shut up! What? They hurt. Fucking a. Guys! What the hell's wrong with you? Um, the-- of-- the-- What? Would you talk? He's parking. He's parking? Who? What the hell's he talking about? What the fuck now? Look. Look, see him? Shit. See? His face was rotten. I had this once before after my father died. I saw him in the bathroom. Shut up. I did. Shut up. I did. He was combing his hair. Quiet. What do we do? Should I open the door or not? No. We didn't kill him. That's right. We didn't kill him. Okay. Oh, god. What the fuck is going on here? What do you people think, you can do whatever you want, you have free will or something? You don't have free will! You don't have free will! You don't have carte blanche. Didn't you hear of private property? That's my family's dope you are selling. It belongs to me! Okay, all right. I-- uh-- We-- We thought you were dead. Yeah, I'll bet you did. Unless you give the dope to gianni soletsko, I will be. And so will you, too. What are you, mute? Stoned? Hey, let's light up a j and wait to get whacked. Hey, let's light up a j and wait to get whacked. You listen here, hipsters, because I'm only going to say it one more time. This is not fantasy island. You are not winning the marijuana lottery here. You are giving the Mary Jane, as promised, to gianni the wop. Okay, but why? What is this, philosophy 101? Why? Because I say so. I didn't go to Princeton fucking university to get whacked by some Guinea slime ball who thinks that I stiffed him who thinks that I stiffed him in some stupid pot deal! Your voice. It's different, right? Yeah. It's like... Yeah. You're not Malcolm. You're Robert. Robert? What? You're Malcolm's brother? Good morning. Is anybody awake yet? So they're twins. We're getting up to speed now, aren't we? Pedal to the floor. I bet you're the one pretending to be my brother. Yeah. You did some job. Yeah. You did some job. Well, thanks. I was working on the voice. I didn't get it exact, but I, you know-- It's not a compliment, asshole. He was a megalomaniac. Marijuana empire. Partners with the mob. And he was supposed to be the bright one. Where is he now, huh? Feeding Wally the worm. If I let that go down, I'm sure not going to think twice about you punks. You think I can't kill on my own? Huh? Like flies. Goddamnit. Okay, do we all feel like men now? You know? Okay, Robert. What about the pilot? What about the pilot that killed your brother? Yeah. The pilot timmie? His bark is worse than his bite. I can handle timmie, okay? I can handle timmie, okay? You just get the loco weed to gianni, and I'll send you your wages. Hold on. I still don't understand. Okay, double your wages. Just do it and forget about it, or you're all going to the crowbar hotel. Huh? For the murder of my brother. Capische? Comprenez-vous? Here. Here's 10 bucks. Get a fucking haircut. Um, wait. Can I just ask you one thing, please? Now I'm really confused. Okay. Okay, what? Let's do it. Do what, Jack, what Robert said or what the ski mask guy said? Robert can kiss my ass. Let's get the dope to Danny and get our money. Come on. Let's go. Won't Robert kill us if we do that? He knows the pilot, timmie. He was in on Malcolm's murder. Robert's a pussy, okay? He said he let it happen to Malcolm. All right? He said that. On his own, he wouldn't hurt a fly. Maybe not, but somebody would. Maybe not, but somebody would. Somebody did. Who the fuck hired the pilot? Could somebody tell me that, please? What difference does it make? What difference does it make? Who cares? Someone's going to kill us no matter what we do. No, no. No. No? No, gianni's not going to kill us. How do you figure? He's not going to kill Robert either. He wants the dope or the money. All right? That's why the rich bastard came over here. To protect his money, not his life. All right? All right? And now he's going to lose his fucking trust fund to the mafia. Isn't that great? He pays the mob, and we walk free and clear. I don't know, man. Are you sure? Because that sounds like eight different kinds of insane to me. Show some fucking guts, Carter! Goddamnit! I'm sick of you pussying out. Show some fucking guts. We're talking about millions of fucking dollars here. That's not a walk in the park. You bastards are not going to screw this up for me. You bastards are not going to screw this up for me. Do you understand? You remember three weeks ago we didn't have shit. And now we've got $3 million right there in our grasp. All we got to do is take it. That's all we got to do. So are you with me? Is anybody listening to this? Do you understand me, you fucks? I'll be back in an hour, maybe less. Um, Jack? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't all split up right now. You know? What are you talking about? I'm saying, man. You know. What's to keep you from just driving off with all the money, man? Hey, look, look. Somebody's got to run this show, right? And that takes some concentration, something you folks wouldn't know anything about right now, so don't talk to me about that. Be that as it may, man-- what if... What? What? Jack, what if maybe just one of us goes with you? It's one buyer, one seller. You know that. Yeah, we know that, Jack, but, you know... But what? You want to do something really fucking stupid and blow this deal? Is that what you want? This is what I'm talking about. What? Okay? I'm sorry, but I'm just going to have to insist, not to ride-- Insist? Yeah. Not to ride with you but just to watch, man. I mean, things have just gotten too crazy. You guys are the biggest fuckups in the history of dope dealing. That's a huge fucking statement. That's a huge fucking statement. You know what I mean? Hey, Jack, no. No. No, you're not going alone, man. All right? You're just going to have to trust me. Jesus. Okay? Just fucking trust me, Carter. Hey, guys! What the fuck's wrong with you? Shit. Get the fucking door off of me, punk. What the fuck's wrong with you? We're going. We're going. Hey, stop kicking, man. - Stop it. - I'm not kicking. You're not kicking? No. Back hurts. A little louder, guys. Think there's still a couple people in the mall who can't hear you. We should get a bigger car. We should get a bigger car. Shut up. Stop it. Shut up. Hey. Hey. Beautiful day, huh? Yeah. Life is good to me. What's happening? Exactly. I'm glad we practically killed each other to get here. I can't see a goddamn thing. So let's adjust the mirror. What are you, crazy? Jack is right. We have to stay cool. Since when do you agree with Jack? Yeah. Yeah. I don't agree with anybody. This is taking way too long. Could you say that again? How do you know how long it's supposed to take? Danny's got to check the crop, right? So chill. How many pounds? How many pounds? 1500. I'll say one thing. Whoever grew this shit had a green thumb. Thanks. That's some of the highest thc content I've seen all summer. All right. We're proud of it. Hey, you know anything about hunting dogs? How so? Bloodhounds. You know that they can smell a trail days old? A deer walks by, just barely touches a twig. You know what I'm saying? A deer walks by, just barely touches a twig. You know what I'm saying? Just grazes it. That dog, he could smell it a week later. It's amazing, huh? To tell you the truth, I don't know a lot about dogs. Amazing creatures. The thing is, I can smell things, too. I can just smell when something's going wrong. Well, nothing's wrong. No? It would've been a whole lot better if you two comics had been straight with me from the get go. I mean, I'd have preferred that personally, I mean, I'd have preferred that personally, as a matter of personal fucking style. You mean about Malcolm. I mean fucking everything. Go on, count. I'm sorry. I can't stand this anymore. Don't, Carter. I just want to take a quick look. I said don't. Like you're really going to fucking shoot me, right? Try me. So what are you, with Jack now? Please. Please. You're with Jack. Yeah, I can see that now. Look, what you guys don't seem to understand is that everybody likes you. They'd like to see you make a little profit on this deal. Everybody? The community, Sierra kahan, the growers. Christ, we're just trying to keep the peace up here, you know, keep those Guinea bastards out. You guys are such amateurs. But you make good suspects. You even buried Malcolm for us. You even buried Malcolm for us. Wait a fucking minute. You're saying everybody was in on this? Everybody knew? Everybody always knows, man. Everybody knows everything up here. When are you going to learn that? I'll be you and Jack planned this whole thing, and you've been stringing me along, stringing Carter along. You'd actually fucking shoot me, wouldn't you? Yeah, even though I love you. Yeah, even though I love you. What? I don't understand. You're with Jack, you're with Carter. Am I missing something here? Is that what it is? Okay, that's fine, but, Danny, when I was counting this, it seems to be about 2 1/2 million. What's that all about? That's good counting. Everybody likes us but you're fucking us on the deal. Is that what you're saying? Look, if it was Malcolm, I would've given him four. I might've given him five. I told you I'd give you three. But I took out a half a million 'cause you lied to me but I took out a half a million 'cause you lied to me about Malcolm, all right? It's two and a half. That's it? Take it or leave it. Okay. Hey, we were having a verbal conversation. Yeah. We were. So, you love me? Well, then... Please don't. Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey. All right. The rest of the money's in the grocery bag. He's walking away without the briefcase. He's walking away without the briefcase. Let me see. Wait. What the fuck? No! Shit! Wait! Wait. Danny, hang on. Fuck! Wait! This is bullshit. Come on! Listen! What's going on? Listen to me. Here, here! No! Let me fucking go. Please! This is nothing. It meant nothing. Would you please... Danny, listen. Listen. Listen to me. This is a missed opportunity, man. Get the fuck away from the car! Get the fuck away from the car! You get away from Danny! Shit. Goddamnit. Shit! You fucking idiot! You horrible fucking idiot! What are you, a genius? You walked right towards our car! Shit! We had the briefcase! The plants! Let's get the plants! Come on. I don't have the fucking keys. You don't have the keys? Are you fucking kidding me? Unbelievable. God damn. Where's the fucking keys? How should I know? I fucking had them! How should I know? I fucking had them! Would you help me? Find the fucking keys! I got them here! Come on! Here! Wait a minute. Where are we going? Anywhere. I've got to get in. Let me in. Sirens! I hear cops! The cops! No, no, no, no, no... I'm not leaving the dope! I'm not leaving the fucking dope. I've come too far to let you motherfuckers... I've come too far to let you motherfuckers... Jack! Come on! Goddamnit! I'm not leaving this dope. Come on. Hey, over here, guys. Over here quick. We're with you. We'll protect you. Yo, motherfuckers. Go home. It just breaks my heart. It just breaks my heart. Look at all that green, man. Yeah, smell it, baby. Whoo, damn shame. Messed up, man. Come on. Hurry up. Whoo! Hey, your boss let you off work? Yeah, he's right over there. What do you think? Hawaiian seeds? Afghani. Afghani. I can't watch this. My life is over. First Lucy. Now the money. You guys, too. You guys, too. You hear me? You're all fucked. You know what? By god, we're not fucked. There's some land down the road for sale. We got the seeds, and we got the knowhow. You know, by next harvest season, we could be right back where we were. Getting fucked by Danny. Yeah, maybe the cops could tow it all right back here and burn it all again. And burn it all again. You know what? I think we should do this every year. Yeah, what do you say, Harlan? You in? Yeah.
