ON BORROWED TIME With Story by Screenplay by Music by Editor Director of Photography Directed by Please, gentlemen. Your ticket, please. Your ticket, please, sir. Your ticket, sir. Your ticket, sir. He's dead! He's dead! Driver! Stop, please! Get down! Please, get down, gentlemen! Come on! Please, get down, gentlemen! Let's get down. Come on. Mr. Cesare!? It's aImost eight o'cIock. Mr. Cesare?! Mrs. Proietti has called. She says you should go for that repair. She says nobody coud wash themselves this morning. What am I to tell her? Alright! Mr. Cesare, aren't you feeling well?! No, no, I'm just fine. How come you've dressed so smartly? Yesterday, I saw a guy die in the tram. - Did you make it up? - No. But we had, more or less, the same age. Yeah, sure, laugh, laugh... Laugh! But that one laid there, stiff... Do you get it? Heart attack. Heart... attack... And he was my age! That means... your age also. Do you get it? One gets in the tram in the morning... like usually... fresh like a flower... and suddenly, the heart... fails! Don't go by tram anymore... I'll do something else. Let's hear it... I've stopped working. But you're almost 53 years old... You're not a child anymore. It's just because I'm 53 years old. How much more will I be around? 5, 10... 15 years. And, who knows, maybe less. Then you shouldn't have started working even as a child. Even new borns die. At a child, it's a misfortune. But at our age, we live with death. Do you understand this? Do you remember my poor wife? Strong, sturdy... she seemed in perfect health, didn't she? But, then, in 15 days... she was gone. Come on, climb up! But who's gonna support you? That's the least important thing. I've got some money put aside. This means that when it'll be gone... something will happen. Did you see it? Did you see how you die? Keep it up! Keep on working! Go on! - Hey, Ce'! Wake up! - Come on! It's daybreak! - I really feel well. - Yeah, sure, sure. Sleeping one night in open air, it already makes you feel younger. - Amilcare! - Where're you going?! Somewhere. Wanna come? Come. Come with me. Amilcare. Don't be afraid, come. Look. Come here and look. Takke a look. This one here was born the same day I was. You see? The 11th of April, 1908. The same date, exactIly the same one. April... 1908. And what does it mean? What does it mean... It means... it means... Don't you get it? It means I'm on borrowed time. - This or that, we all Iive on borrowed time. - Exactly. And so, I'll go on hoIiday. - Show me your identity card. - Why? Show it to me. Come on... Quicklier... What do you want with it... it's expired... Amilcare Franceschetti... painter... Italian nationality... domicile... Whar are you doing?! No! What are you doing? Where're you going? Eh? Where could I go? After all, what do you want from me? - Why? - What did I do to you? Why do you want to harm me? - I?! - You wanna make my heart sick?! If you don't want to do anything, you don't want to work, don't work. - I'm tired... wanna go sleep. Gravedigger! - I?! Gravedi...? Why?! Come here! Stupid! Come here! Come here! - Come on! Let's go! Follow it! - Get down! I must go to work! What work? You'll go afterwards! ''WE WANT HOMES!'' - It's the 2nd time we demonstrate for houses. - Is there a doctor's office here? - Yes, and I'm the doctor. - Oh, it's you... Could you tell me the scientific name for ticks? - Argas reflexus. They come from Africa and can even carry meningitis. Before making this demostration, have you notified the authorities? Yes, in fact we did, but to no avail. - How many inhabitants are you here? - We were 11 ,000, but it's only half now. - And the ticks? Tell me about the ticks. - Some stray dog mus've got'em, kids took it inside. - I'll show you the ticks. - Why, is there a certain place? - Yes, they're found by kids on the wall. - Here, look... Here! - That's where you saw them? - Yes. - There's a nest! There's a nest! - There's a nest of big ticks, dog ticks. And not only here. In Quarticciolo also. - So there are more cases. - The mother passes it to her son. - Is it dangerous? - Yes, they prick, they attack... - Where are you taking them? - To the slaughterhouse. - Where? - To the slaughterhouse! Sir. Sir! What's happened? - Nothing... Excuse me. - Leave me alone! Doesn't matter! Come on! Cut them. How come you didn't go to work this morning? I work the afternoons. Ah, the afternoons. Hearts. What are you doing! Play, it's your turn. Damn it! Now I'll have to play a trump. What are you doing? You must first draw a card. What's with you this morning? How much I'd like to be able to swim... Eh? To swim? Well, learn. I'm afraid of water. But, it's so good staying at home and doing nothing! Mr. Ce', you're even teaching her to play cards now?! Can I have a smoke? Be careful! Your mother's around! Smoke, smoke... Excuse me... - You've got patience... - They have to be washed. - Get lost! Get lost! - Get lost... And where? Go take a walk. Don't you see what a beautiful day it is? If only I couId go... Get lost! Good afternoon. - Your ticket, sir! - Eh? - Your ticket. - But... - How much is it? - 300 lire. - Who painted it? - Raffaello. - How much could it cost? - How should I know... Not that I intended to buy it, but... - And this one, whose is it? - Cranach. This one is really beautiful, no? - It's beautiful, this one, eh! - No. Why not? Then how come I like it? Simply because you like it. What work do you do? What has that got to do? I'm a plumber. So you're a solderer. Everyone with his craft. - Why, are you a painter? - No, I live among them, I'm an art dealer. - You're a solderer, no? - Yes. What are the connotations of this painting, eh? Soppiness, melodrama,... sentimentality Haven't you ever played with beautiful figurines? What do I know about beautiful figurines? Then, even this is melodrama, sentimentality? This is not melodrama. This is life, not make-believe. - It's Raffaello! - He seems alive! You see, professor, if one like me understands only today certain things, they tell you it's too late. And this is unjust. Don't you think so? Or at least it's sad, isn't it? No, it's fair. You'd have had to be Einstein to know more than... This is the most dramatic sign of old age. Why should a 45 years old man have to get involved with 45 years old women? Why? Because one... come, come to my house, I live here, in the back, near the lock. I'd like to show you something... new... artistically fulfilled... somehow distinct... with shapes... See, yours is a modern problem. You're, without even knowing it, an existentialist But... who's in there? No, no, don't expect finding models, nude women... See, my guest paints in a totally informal manner. How's that? In... Informal... Come, come... You don't have to understand... just watch. Come, come... Society expresses it's issues... these paintings... - Society alienates... - Alienates... History in itseIf is... Well? Still stuck? That american's waiting. - I had said an informal one... - Yeah, sure... - No, this is zilch. - My friend, the plumber. - Glad to meet you. The bog's in there. Incredible things... these blessed painters they use lavatory... tub... for a wastebin... jars, canvases,... caulifIowers... and then it gets blocked and... you need something to clear up... - Do you have a monkey-wrench? - I don't, but I can find one. Please, there, in that corner, on that brick... spruce it up... we're trying to make it look decent, after all, ... You, you do what... sweep it... Do it, do it... We think we know so many things, but we know nothing! Got it? Nothing! We are like cats, prisoners in a sack! - Got it. You have drunk. - I have drunk... - If il professore sees you, you're done for - Why? Why... Because it's too obvious... You understand immediateIy what this is, a zebra crossing! - Look here! - No! - A dot! - I'll lose my jOb.! - Go away! - If you'd be a free man like me... - Mad man! Yes! I'm mad, and you... You are mad! You! Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God! Listen! This stairway, did you climb it running? - Yes, running. And it left you breathless. - You still smoke 30 cigarettes a day? - Unfortunatelly, yes - Well, this is it. - What's wrong with me? - What did you expect, a giant if you'd make him smoke 30 cigarettes a day, and then make him climb a mountain running would be breathless! Who knows, then... where the attack will come from? What attack?! Doctor! What? - Doctor, I'm afraid! - Afraid of what? I'm afraid of... the thing. - Of cancer. - I'm afraid also! What are you saying! Doctor! Doctor! I'd like you to tell me... you surely must know, you've studied so much and... - if... you must surely know this. - What? I'll tell you, you might think it's a stupid thing, but... wouldn't it be possibIe to know from now when... will I die? - Did you take me for a fortune teller? - No, no, doctor! - Go, go. Excuse me, you know... don't be mad... you've known me for so long examined me for so many years maybe, just maybe... you must know it... - At least, at least not now, no? - No one of us can know it, Cesare. - How come you don't know? - But I can't know it! - Excuse me, there's peopIe waiting for me - I'll take my jacket - Thanks, doctor. Good bye. - Don't worry, good bye. - Could I have a bath, please? How much? - 2.50. - Bath. - Bath? Giulia... You didn't recognise me at first, did you? But I, I have recognised you as soon as I saw you. You haven't changed a bit. No, no, you haven't changed. My God, a little something... that's bound to, time goes by for all of us... Look at me... Will you take the bath? Eh? Well... sure... But I don't have anything, no towel... no soap, I've got nothing. I saw you a few times. One day, you were on Corso Vittorio, with your wife, I think, five years ago... Did you? And why didn't you call for me? How could I? I was with Rodolfo... - He's called Rodolfo, your husband is. - Yes... Come! - Get in. - Do you know I can't remember anymore why we didn't get married? - I do remeber. You didn't want to. - I? I didn't want to? I was saving money! What money? The one you were playing every evening at the cafe? If I, afterwards... I'd have looked for you after you had married the other one, Why ask me these questions now? And if... I'd have stopped you, asked you to see each from time to time... would you have said yes? How should I know? - It's ready. Take your bath. - Couldn't we meet again? - Why? Nothing. I just wanted to spend some time with you, speak... What's there to speak about?! Alright. Go! I got things to do. I've got to make important decisions. I need help. Why shouldn't we meet one of these days? In front of the Giulio Cesare Cinema... - In front of a cinema? - Yes, yes. - What's with all this, Ce'? Yes... step in, please. I've got a husband, children... I even am a grandmother, and we are to meet in front of a cinema! You must come, Giulia. I must have your advice. - Giulia.! - Are you mad? Departure Of Air France flighT Number 609 to Paris. - Excuse me, where does it fly to? - To Paris. Excuse me... Wouldn't there be a smaller flight available? - What do you mean? - I don't know... a short flight, if not a small tour, above the city... Then, sir, you should go to Aeroporto dell'Urbe. Yes. Yes, hello? Thank you. Look who's here, Robertino! Come, hug your grandpa! Now, grandpa's going to give you a pack of sweets. Why have you come? You need money? What are you talking about, papa?! I haven't seen you for so long... - Take the child - Come to papa, come Exactly. Since the last time you needed money. Now, if Robertino gives grandpa a big kiss He's old, and miserable, grandpa gives him the sweets. Just a moment, the kiss first! A nice kiss. I wanna feel it! - Have you eaten yet? - Yes. - And you've even drunk. - Yes. You smell it. What do you intend doing? - You bring it out at last? - What do you intend doing? - What do you care? What do you mean what do I care?! I've been working until half an hour ago. But I still can't afford to rest. Maybe in a few years time... I don't know, but at first I must settle down. Allow me to get started and then we'll see... I get it. You want to retire me... naturally. When I'll be stenching, no? Papa, don't be childish! No need to call me 'papa'. If you're tired rest for a while. You're thinking about how much wouId supporting me cost. True? Come here, you! Let's not allow the child to hear us this way. Take him home. Good bye, Robertino. Kiss grandpa. Come on. Take him... Come on, go. Go! - Isn't Graziella eating tonight? - She's working very late, poor soul Oh, yes?! I don't even know where to go this evening. I really haven't decided. - Try seeing the Coliseum lit. - Oh, yes... What are you talking about... It's only a big scam! Then go at the station... see all those people I've really thought about that. - But... same thing as going to bed, no? - Sleeping?! Go in a night club. What should I do in a night club? Watch the others having fun? I'm not even hungry tonight! Sometimes, I think I don't care about anything anymore. Will this story go on long, Ce'? Or will it end with you telling me one evening you don't have the board money? Here's Jupiter! Average distance, 777 million km. And Saturn? - 50 lire - 50 lire. Here's 50 lire - Please. - Thank you. - Don't touch it, yes? 1,400, 000, 000 km. Watch it. Admire those rings! They look like a priest's hat! What are you looking at? Have you told my mother anything? No. Mr. Cesare, I wanted to tell you one thing. I don't want to hear anything you've got to say. But don't you want to help me? I just did what you did. I've stopped workin'. But what are you saying? In fact, I've had the idea before you did. I've quit my job two months ago! - Does your mother know it? - No. At the end of the month I givve her my pay, like before. What do you imagine? I've worked all my life. I. Since I was 12 years old. I'm oIld. I'm 54. Do you get it? And I'm 17. You get money from those with cars? Eh? It's someone I've known for a long time. He's nice to me. But he's old! He's your age! And you're not at all old. - I... I'm ashamed. - What for? 'What for'? To hear you talking like this. I wanted to have fun. Mr. Cesare. Do you think I didn't look for other jobs? I had even found one. But it was a cashier's job. They asked for a deposit. 50,000 lire. Who was going to give it to me? How could I find 50,000 lire? I don't care anymore. 30... 40... and with these ones, 50. Here's your 50,000 lire. But start working again! Got it? Go immediateIy back to work! Go! Or I'll let your mother know. And when must I give it back to you? 100 llire per month. Are you ready, Amilcare? Let's go, Spartacus! I'm not bathing, the water's cold. So many people! I often feel like stopping them, one after the other. Who? All these ones. They always are the same ones. And why wouId you want to stop them? To speak to one another, to find out what they do, where they go, what they think. But what do you care about it? What do you care? You walk amidst strangers, get it? How many human beings have I known in my life? One hundred? Two hundred? What?! Three hundred, tops! Isn't it? You don't care you don't know your fellow men. The most one does is read in the papers: cuts open his wife, six children, then kills himself. Or: cuts his father's head, then runs away, and so on. I see to my business. After all I know nothing about anything. I don't even know a Russian! Got it? What do you want to be when you grow up? - I? Nothing. - How's that 'nothing'? - You'll have to do something, isn't it? - I... astronaul. Astronaut! - And you, what's your trade? - I'm a solderer. I'm a solderer, my friend... A good trade! What do you think! You play around with the blowtorch! Pipes break down in houses, and then everyone's calling for you: rich, poor, film stars, Ministers, Cardinals, you go in everyone's home! - Got it?! - Which houses? - What's happened? - Someone has drowned! - Has one of us drowned? - What am I to do with you?! - Why? - Where have you been? We've been looking for you for an hour! - But I was here, on the beach! - The hell of a fright you've given us! - You though it was him that had drownwed? - Yes, him! There's nothing! Nothing! It's a scam! The one that should have died is alive! Imagine!... Had I really drowned... More, imagine the three of us... we are dead! We are three... ghosts! LOOk.! LOOk.! LOOk.! You see? You see the people? The people have fun. All of them. They all have fun. We are dead and all goes on as before, without us. You're a fun-killer! I... I try to understand. I'm tearing myself apart to understand! That's what it is! Hi! I've aIready bought tickets. Look at her! You've bought new shoes! Oh, Ce', what a fun-killer you are! Why fun-killer? What did you want to tell me? Nothing. You know... I wanted to be with you a little, I wanted your advice, because... I don't know, strange things have been happening to me for these last days, I feel I'm getting a little crazy... Nothing bad... I don't know, maybe I've decided to return to my home village but here it's not the place to speak about this kind of things. Let's see the movie! - Where's your hand? - No... - I don't even have my glasses... - God how they're shooting! Thank you. - What are you doing? I'm no seat! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry - There's no excuse! - Please, don't get angry. - What happened? - Oh, nothing, I've only sat on someone. It's so dark... I'm sorry. I'm deeply sorry. - Do you want... my glasses? - No, thank you. I'll do without. - What are you looking at? - Eh? Nothing. What did you want to tell me? What are you doing here? Haven't you gone to work? How was it? They wouldn't give you the job? I didn't even go. And what have you done with the money I've given you? I've bought a periwig. A... what? A periwig. What's this? You've bought yourself a wig? A wig?! That's madness! I shouldn't have spent that money, no? I took 50,000 lire from my pocket and gave it to you so you could pay the... the the deposit. And you go buy yourself a... a periwig! But that's laughabel upon my word! Don't worry about the money. Somehow... I'll pay it back. You'll pay it back... how will you pay it back? I don't like being in debt. Please... Lucky you! Life, you understand,... Years go by. They go by. They go by, they go by... And how they do go by! Do as you like! Are you alone? This is called The Drops Mountain... Nobody ever comes here... who knows why... They say that in Antiquity here was the Roman Customs. They broke all the jars... Oil jars... All in pieces. It must be because of the climb. It has even worn me down. Do you want to make a drama out of it? Stop it! - Who are they mad on? - With the wholesalers, who else! - But why? - 'cause they buy the fruits cheap and sell them pricily. - Damn bastards. - That's how it goes. What do you want? I appologize, ma'am, I only wanted to take a look. Come in. Thank you. - These are americans, no? - Yes. - Well? - There, inside... - that's where I was born. - Have you finished? Oh, yes. Good bye, then. Good bye... and thank you. - I sell it 'cause I need the money for my family! - If you want, give it to them! I won't! If I have to take from the tree, I won't! I need the money! I ned the money! - And what about your rights? - What rights! The money! Then wholesale dealers Will always win! I can't recognize noone here anymore. Some went to Rome, some to America... some are dead... - Who has died?- For instance, SempIlice Santurri, the postman - The one a with a little hunchback. - Ah, Semplice Santurri, I think I remember - What did he die of? - DruNnkard. That's why I only drink when eating. You should know that around here, wine is for killing time. By the way, how much does land cost around here? They shove earth in your face. They give it away, 'cause nobody works it anymore! - If you don't mind... - Please do. - Oh my God you don't recognise me! - Who are you? How come who am I? I'm Cesare! Constantino! Know what I've decided? I've decided to return here, home. We are good here. I'm pleased. Little work and can sleep a Iot. Here's real wine. Bread from flower. Let's go! What is it? Come on! Come on! We have arrived. - Thank you. Good bye. - Good bye. 'FORWARD' I'm coming. I'm coming. But can an existence made of thousand identical moments be called a life? A chain of imposed moves and steps? Without a holiday or a getaway! A job he didn't like, and a family... that didn't love him! 365 days a year, for more than 40 years... You are the ones... That should send this maN into prison. - No! But what else has his life been until this very day? If not darkness, prison! Penitenciary! Forced labour! Forced residence! It's true. Silence! Or I'll evacuate the court room! - What has she done? - Her son got 15 years. 15 years! - And he's innocent! - Categoricaly not! Rape... attempted murder, caught in the act...

Ce'! - Hi! - What are you doing here? - GIad to meet you. - GIad to meet you. Oh, nothing. I've got nothing to do. So I come here to kill time. At the bad Palace. To see what's happening. What are you doing here? There's a little thing... I'm a witness. - Witness at what? - A law-suit, a friend... Do you who know he is? He taught me being a solderer. I worked in his shop. The only thing I know how to do. - Listen, Ce'... - What? Listen... - Is it true you don't want to work anymore? - Yes. I mean... what will you do when money runs out? It has already run out. - What will you do, steal? - Come on... I'll teach you a scam Nice, quick, three big ones! - They'd all do it! - Sure, all... There's the fright. You have to make a sacrifice. The judge won't wait for us! Let's move it! Ciao, Ce'! Hurry up! Are you coming? Move it! We already are half an hour late! Move it! - Everything's ready. Come back the day after tomorrow. Don't forget, please! If you please, where should I go for craftmen's pensions? If you please, here's for pensions? - What's your trade? Plumber. - For how long? - Almost 30. - What's your name? - Conversi Cesare. - How oId are you? - 53. - 60 are needed. - Oh, yes? How much do I get at 60? From 12,000 to... - 12,500. - How much? Around 12, 000. And a little more. I'm no Bank of Italy! Enough it's enough! And with those I gave you yesterday, it makes 7,000. You do as you want... but if you wanna eat, you must toil! It's easy doing nothing, and making us work! Go at your son, at least! What am I to do? What do you want? Listen! You must tell me something. You must tell me how much can a man like you make in one day? I don't speak with you. I don't speak with anyone. What do you care? The check. - Alright. 2,007. Keep the change. - Thank you. - 2,007? - Sure. We've eaten fish, chicken and the wine... - And you even gave her a 300 tip! - Sure. Of course. - Have you gone mad? - Why? I don't know, you probabIy eat like this, only once a week, or even a month. Hey, I eat everyday, you know. I don't care a damn about anyone. I do anything. I steal, I only think about myself, I think about protecting myself! Have you ever helped anyone? No one. Must hold tight! You must defend yourself! You must steal! Got it? Hold tight! For instance: I'll give you a very simple one. Watch the bus. Keep watching it! When it leaves, there's always a... jump. watch it. I'm impressed. - Exactly. - Yes. It's legal. So, when the bus starts, you fall and pretend you hit your head. And if you know how to do it, the transport company... pays. - Got it? It's a very simple trick. Yes. It's simple. You can even do it without any organization. It's a loner's job!... You don't make much! - Counselor, he is Ce'. - Glad to meet you. - Glad to meet you. You must subtract 30% from the insurance money. Let's say you get 3,000,000. The net sum you get is 2,100,000. That's how it is. Yes, that's how it is! First of all, there is my cut. I don't want any percentage, but a fixed cut! Then there's us. You must give us two 5%. - And there's the executioner. - Who? The executioner is extremely important. He's a technician. It's in your best interes for him to be chosen with the utmost care. Executioner... Hello?! Yes, speaking. One second. Please go in the garden. Come on, let's go! - What executioner? - He must be very precise, like a surgeon. I know one better than Valdoni. It's nothing, I've done it three times. You'll see. - Yeah, sure. Only one hit. The arm breaks exactly at the right place. Yeah, yeah... who knows how strong the pain will be! Excuse me, besides this... technician, is there anyone else to be paid? Well, the driver... -Eh? - The one who is supposed to have run you down. - Pardon? - He'll take 100,000. And the witness. I can't go to the courthouse without a witness! Think about it! It seems simple to me! Do you know I like you? You remind me of my father. For him I started doing 'accidents'. I organized it. The flakes 'accident'. You want an ice-cream? - No. Cream, chocolate and caramel. Take the peanuts. - What did you break him, your father? - A leg. This one. Who could say the pain the poor old man felt? He didn't feel anything. He got scared. Courage! - But then... - Then? What was the scam? I broke him a finger. This one. 30,000. Peanuts! What do you advise me? An arm or aleg? A leg. It pays more. But it's more difficult. Better an arm. Maybe. But it pays less. A leg... or an arm. Mr. Ce'.! - Who is it? - Vinicio, on the phone, says he wants to talk to you. Nothing, nothing, tell him that... that I'm not here. I'm not here! It only takes an instant, you'll see. Once it's done, we'll take you outside, on the street, where we've set everything up. You'll see they'll gather round, one will notice you have a broken arm they'll say you must be taken to a hospital. Let them take care of it. - Got it? - Vinicio! - All set? - All set. The car's here. Waits the signal. The witness also, he's in the bar. - This is... - Cesare. - Glad to meet you. You must take off your jacket. - Alright. - Got it? You must roll the sleeve of your shirt, got it? - Yes. - You must roll... - Stay calm, don't butt in - Courage! Yes, courage. Courage. - I've already done it three times. - Yes? Then show me! Courage. Don't you question my courage, I've got it, just hurry up. Let's do it! - What am I to do? - Nothing. - I... - Get down. - Come on! - Eh? What? - Nothing. Sit. Like this. - Like this? - Like this. - You've got guts, I won't harm you. - What? What?... Very well. I won't harm you. Very well. I won't harm you. When the arm will be numb, you'll tell me. Got it?
