SCHOOLGIRL REPORT Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again. You'll remember us if you're among the 30 million people... who saw our first three Schoolgirl Reports in 28 countries... and turned them into a global blockbuster. Still, no film has ever been attacked as ours. But almost everything you saw came from authentic sources. Life writes the most interesting scripts. Of course we will not claim... that all schoolgirls behave the way they are portrayed in our films. But it would also be foolish to close your eyes to the facts. SCHOOLGI RL REPORT 4: WHAT DRIVES PARENTS TO DESPAI R Based on the book by Gunther Hunold With an epilogue by Kurt Seelmann Former Director, City Youth Office of Munich Starring many anonymous youths and parents Written by Music by Photography Design Edited by Executive Producer Produced by Directed by Schoolgirls today. They have the same problems as previous generations... but they find solutions their parents would have thought impossible. I'm Elfie and I'm 18. I'm about to finish high school. I have a big problem: Math. Unfortunately, your last test was again a big catastrophe. I told you that this test could serve in a way... as a dress rehearsal for your graduating exams. Elfie, with such a poor grade, how do you see your future? Actually, it's easy. A nice expensive car, a villa with a heated pool... a few horses and a CEO. You see, I'm quite modest. Then you better get busy. With your math skills, you couldn't even sell hot dogs. I've never seen such muddled work. If all students were like you... I'd want to leave this profession. I'm sorry. But here's a proposal. Let me graduate with a C, and you'll be a happy man. Elfie's quite sure ofherself. Where does this confidence come from? - You're great. - Really? No wonder I almost got seasick. You're like a storm. What do you think the wind force was? Category 4 or 5. - No, it was a full-blown hurricane. - That's what you think. Why do you give me bad grades? You talk about school again... and now the mood is gone. Don't take it like that. It'll be over in a few months. I hope so. That's what I thought last year, but then I had to repeat it. If I don't pass this time, I'm finished. I have to do it. Forget it. Just be nice to me. No, please. Let's go back now. Fucking math. It really gets on my nerves. - Are you up for it today? - I'm always up for it. Let's just say, "Wind force: Category 12." - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - I'll talk to him. - He's too senile. He won't understand. I don't think so. Most tough teachers usually have a heart as soft as butter. Him? Don't make me laugh. I need a C in math. That's how it is, Mr. Studienrat. I have to pass the graduating exam. Repeating the year once was bad enough for my father. He would send me to the factory to work there. What can I do? You have connections in the education department. I must have the math questions. Before the exam. Understand? Do you know what you're asking, Elfie? If I did have those connections, as you say... you certainly know... that such behavior would jeopardize my entire career. I wouldn't tell anyone... and besides... you wouldn't be expected to do it for nothing. Are you trying to bribe me? No, I'm not. At least not with money. Where would I get that? Are you saying you'd offer me... Why not? - Get out! - It wouldn't be a sacrifice for me. I think you're very nice. I mean it. - You're crazy. - Why? I should expel you. - But, Mr. Studienrat... - Please leave, Elfie. Are you kicking me out? No, I'm not. But I ask you to leave. Wouldn't you like to see what you'd get? I asked you to leave. - Go. - You're saying no? You'll hear from me. The department of education? Please connect me with Undersecretary Mahlzahn. Mr. Studienrat. - May I speak with you? - Yes. Well? You're a coward. You're not a man. You wanted to see me, Mr. Studienrat? Please go to the desk. - What is it? - There, behind the books. I've risked my career for you. The math questions. You're a great guy. I'm not so sure that it's good. I'll be very nice to you. I won't tell anyone. I'm not mean. How do you like it? I'm quite experienced. You. Elfie. Do you like it this way? I like it. I'm crazy. I know I'm crazy. No, you're sweet. And some say you're senile. Come. You... I've always loved you. You can never leave me again. You know... many teachers have married their students. What is a difference of 20 years? You must stay with me always. Congratulations, Elfie. More luck than brains, eh? Why? I've always been a math whiz. It's just that nobody noticed. What matters is that we can forget about school. You and a C in math. Honestly, it's a miracle. Miracle or not, I got my C, and that's all. Let's celebrate tonight. When can I pick you up? Just a second. - Mr. Studienrat. - Yes? I wanted to thank you. Without you, I would have failed. - The main thing is that you passed. - Still, it's because of you. Can I see you again? Tonight, my place? Mr. Studienrat, what are you thinking? Our transaction is complete. You've had your fun, and I'm graduating. Did you really think I'd continue sleeping with you? That's what my boyfriend is for. Bye. Newspapers have stories like this every few weeks... because today's girls know full well... that their bodies are a great asset. The topic also concerns the abuse of this asset for mischief. I'm Angelika. I'm 16 years old. There's Rolf, my boyfriend. Hi. Damn, my parents have canceled their trip. Now you can't come over. We'll have to think of something. My place is off-limits too. Did you see the story in the papers about the alleged school doctor? School doctor? Yes, he pretended to be a doctor to meet young girls. - And did he succeed? - Yes, 42 times. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Meier. Doctor Meier. I'm from the education authority, medical services. An epidemic has broken out. I need to conduct a preventative exam. - Can I talk to your parents? - They aren't here. But they'll be back, right? In two hours, at the earliest. That's fine. My job is not to examine your parents, but to examine you. Take a seat. Thank you, but I have to see many other students... and the disease is spreading fast. Let's get right to it. Please undress. - I don't know about that. - But, child, don't be shy. - I'm a doctor. - Of course. I need to do a full exam... so you should take off all of your clothes. Doctors are so highly regarded... that more and more criminals can pass themselves off... as "Uncle Doctor. '" Well? Now, now. Have you never undressed for a doctor? There you go. That's it. Excellent. Now we'll find out if there's anything wrong with you. Interesting. Please turn around. Maybe it's there. You have to be careful. Does this hurt? Excellent. No, all good. Pressure's good. Let's look down here. Cough. Good resonance. Again. The kidneys are okay. Cough again. Does this hurt? Interesting. And if I do it like this... or like that. Is that pleasant or unpleasant for you? I mean, when I do it gently. Yes, it's pleasant. Do you do that yourself? Good child. Good. Epidemics can hide anywhere. Why don't you lie down here? Don't be afraid. It will soon be all behind us. Let's see what we have here. - Does that hurt? - A bit. - And here? - A bit. And if I stroke you like this? And if I go lower? That's swollen. Close your eyes. Try taking it in. When I touch you here, do you feel pleasure? - Or pain? - No, no pain. And now? No. It's nice. Excellent. Now you're in a state where I can treat you best. Lay on your belly, please. Lift your bottom a bit. Yes, just like that. Now relax. Loosen up. Please don't hurt me, Doctor. I'd be a bad doctor if I couldn't handle schoolgirls. Doctor... is that your thermometer? Yes. I didn't know they had such big and thick ones. Why do you keep sliding it in and out? To get the correct temperature faster. Won't you leave... your thermometer here, Doctor? I'm afraid not. I only have one, and I need it myself. That's crazy. But a great idea. - Why? - I could drop by as a school doctor. You'd get the special treatment. But it ended badly. The parents came home early. And the doctor got it. They took him out of circulation. They won't catch us. Still no score for either team. The thousands here in the stadium... expected to see a hot battle between them... but none of the audacious attacks and maneuvers... have materialized yet. What idiot would visit now? Wait. I'll go. If it's someone for Angelika again, throw him out. Tell her to get busy with her homework. And he takes the ball and adds a bit of action... to this otherwise dull game. - Yes? - Good day, ma'am. I'm with the education authority, medical services. I'm Dr. Muller. I'd like to see your daughter Angelika. My God, Doctor. What's wrong? Don't worry, ma'am. It's routine. - We suspect an epidemic. - This way. We have to conduct preventative exams to be sure. Finally! Goal! That Muller is great. This is my husband. Dr. Muller, from the education authority. If your name is Muller, you're welcome to stay. Related to our bomber? No, I'm here to examine your daughter. No, don't get upset. It's simply a preventive measure. How can I not get upset? Look at those fools! Come on, kick that ball. He loses the ball... But he'll take the big money. Go ahead, Doctor. My wife will go with you and be there. - This way. - Please, ma'am. I don't want to keep you. No, it's better if I'm there. Our Angelika is still a child... and a bit shy. As for shyness, I'll take care of that. Especially if I can see her alone. If you say so. But I'll introduce you. Don't you hear? The water's boiling. Really, ma'am. I can introduce myself. As you wish, Doctor. And please do not disturb us. This guy should be penalized. What a colossal fool. They're not playing soccer, but cowboys and Indians. Out to lunch. Did they buy it? Come in. Good day. I'm Dr. Muller, from the education authority. Hello, Doctor. Man, he's really teaching them a lesson. I don't know. Maybe I should have stayed up there. Nonsense. For a school doctor, it's a boring routine. What's all this fumbling? If you have the ball, go and attack! Attack! - You're so... - Hey. Down there. You're so sweet. This is the nicest examination I've ever had. They've finally figured it out. Now, it's working. Come on, get it in! Goal! Goal! Good God, one minute left. Victory! What is it, Otto? I slipped a disc. Wait, I'll get that school doctor. Doctor, come quick. My husband needs you. Sure, I'm just finishing up. Let me pack up my things. Yes, Doctor. I'll wait. I love you. I love you too. Put candy in your cheeks tomorrow, and I'll examine your throat. Doctor, my husband needs you urgently! Well, ma'am, you can rest assured. Your daughter is the picture of good health. The examination was very satisfactory. That's good, Doctor. But since you're here, can you check on my husband? He suddenly can't move. I don't know why. My back hurts so bad. - What are we to do, Doctor? - There's only one thing to do. Call for a doctor. Of course, great idea, Doctor. Bye, Doctor. Otto? Pass it over here. You have feet for hands. I'm Caroline Aschauer. I'm 17. Caroline Aschauer is an adopted child. Her adoptive father is an engineer. Until two years ago, he and his wife lived in Africa. Since the loving couple couldn't have children... they adopted Caroline. She was 18 months old then. They gave the smart child all the proper care. Back in Germany, they sent her to high school... to give her a good start in life. The Aschauer family has its affairs in order. Caroline has grown up without worries in an environment of domestic security. But what about outside her home? Take it. Give it here. If I were black like you, I wouldn't swing my tits like that. You won't get a boyfriend that way. That's how it is every day. The girls hate me, because I'm not like them. They'rejealous of my body. The boys? They see me as an exotic sex toy. Man, she plays like a champ. She's great, I tell you. She'll be even better when it comes to fucking. Blacks really get going when they're fucking. They can never get enough. You're all talk. You're scared to go out with her because of what people might say. Of course I wouldn't go out with her... but I'd fuck her in the dark somewhere. Yes, like the coal cellar. Watch out, guys. Talk about something else. Hans goes into a rage when people talk about his kitten. Hans is my boyfriend. He's the only one who understands me. The girls avoid me... even though I've always been polite and behaved. But they still reject me like on the first day. We can party now. My dad gave me 100 marks. Impossible. He's always so tight with money. Did you catch him with his lover? No, he dumped her. Don't get hysterical. I just want to scrub your back. Do you think I'm a lesbian all of a sudden? Back to the party. It will be great. You'll see. You'll be impressed with my plans. Really? Hey, is she nuts? Are you coming to my party, Caroline? - You can't be serious. - Sure, I am. You've been here for two years and we should be friends. See you at 8:00 tomorrow. I'll gladly come. - I'm happy you invited me. - It was long overdue. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. Are you crazy? Inviting that Negro girl? That black bitch can't come. I won't have the party ruined. - You're crazy. - If she goes, then I won't. I don't like her either. I just invited her because I've got plans for her. - Don't think I'm stupid. - You and your crazy plans. You can't imagine how happy I was. They'd finally accepted me. As often, Hans and I took a ride that afternoon. The two or three hours with him were always great moments. Hans was so different from the others. He was gentle. He was sweet. He wasn't vulgar like the rest. With him, I was so happy I could have embraced the world. I love you so much. What would I do without you? Caroline. My Caroline. That was beautiful, the most beautiful ever. - Are you happy too? - Yes. You're coming to the party with me tomorrow, right? I don't want to go alone. Depends. I have to go to Grunwald with my dad tomorrow night. Too bad. I really wanted to go with you. But you'll pick me up, right? If I can. I hope so. Good evening, I wanted... It's all right. Come in. You can hang it there. - Nobody's here yet? - Look around. What's going on here? You'll see. What do you mean? Why are you doing this to me? I haven't done anything. You ask why? Because you're a Negro slut... driving the boys crazy with your damn brown body. Let's see if you're really better than us... if you stand up to me. Look who's here. You know why? The girls asked us if we wanted to fuck you... - and we do. - Are you insane? We're not good enough to fuck them, so we'll do you properly. Depraved schoolgirls. "My daughter wouldn't do that, '" you'll say. Don't delude yourself, because psychologists know full well. The white girls are mad... because the boys are more attracted to the sexuality of the black girl... than to theirs. They have to destroy the perceived advantages of the exotic girl... to restore order to their world. You pigs! I'll kill you! Shut up! You're gonna get it! You fucked her too! Give it to him. My Caroline. Get lost and take your black slut with you. All that for a Negro? You pigs. You goddamn pigs. I know exactly why you did it... out of fear that she might be better than you. You're all scum. I'm ashamed of you. Hans is right. It was mean. It'll be all right. They're not all like that. You're so good to me. Thank you. Hans was indeed good to her, but what good did it do? The story made the rounds... and soon he was tired ofbeing teased. He left her. And Caroline was alone again. The ideas students can come up with can be seen in the next story. This is Diedlinde. She's 16. Her parents didn't want her last name or hometown mentioned. Don't take that to mean this story was invented. Unfortunately, it actually happened. The variety of characters... is perfectly illustrated by the various women. For example, take Gertrud Stauffacher. She's brave, smart and has a good heart. So the poet has her say... "If my heart were bound like this... I'd burn it down myself." That's our school. Ms. Koller likes hearing herself talk... which is the only thing that interests her about herjob. Of course, we take advantage of it. We do what we want. "Look forward, Werner, and not behind you." They do what they want. Blame it on her teacher. She is doubly to blame... because she has failed to understand the most essential thing: Namely, that youth will always push against the boundaries of what is allowed... pushing them further out. That's their right. But where will schoolgirls end up... if no one, in this case the teacher, sets boundaries? They will become ever more daring... and will begin to regard as freedom... that which society has already condemned... or what may be of interest to the prosecutor. "Where would we find such a bless'd island... if not in the land of innocence?" Notice the metaphors. Island, land of innocence. Schiller, in contrast to Goethe... was always known for coming right to the point. He did not leave any room for misinterpretations. For example, take Act 1, Scene 2, page 15, at the bottom. Schiller has Stauffacher say... "He who presses such a heart to his chest... can fight for his house and home with great pleasure." Then he shifts the initiative back to Gertrud, who says... "You are men, know how to use your axes... and God will help the brave." Then Gertrud lets her femininity speak for her... "You have to accept whatever God sends you. Unreasonableness, a noble heart will not suffer." In all of Schiller's dramatic plays, women have several faces. They may be servants, but they are also strong. WHO DOES HE BELONG TO? Schiller is not only a great poet, but also a great strategist of the theater. It is in the women characters that we see... how Schiller magnifies greatness by contrast. Are these students corrupt? Never base general conclusions on isolated cases. But these things do happen... as reported by schools, youth services and courts. Shit, if Dad finds out that I took his car and wrecked it... he'll kill me. Where will I get 1,300 marks for the repairs? We could chip in. - I have about 15 marks left. - I've got 20. Guys, you must have money. Can you lend Josef some? Bring it out. - He should get a job. - I'm broke. I can you give you 50. That's all I have. You have a lot more. You could be rolling in money. Listen, if we all agree... we could helpJosef while earning so much money... that we all could buy anything we ever wanted. Do you want to rob a bank? Nonsense. I have a much better and safer idea. But the girls have to cooperate. How? You know, Otti, you're not quite right for it. - Why not? - Because of the men. They'll have a few words to say about it. - What do you mean? - You idiot. Haven't you seen the girls? Girls are given great assets by nature... between their legs and also up here. Assets should be put to work. And? Well, if you combine work and pleasure... You mean we should... We'll fuck men and give the money to the boys. We' re not whores. "Whores." That's nonsense. It's just how you look at it. Just think about it. We'll find you some guys who're hot for schoolgirls. The money will be divided equally. - And you'll enjoy it too, right? - You're crazy. I don't know. I could use some money. My parents are too stingy. - Same here. - Not such a bad idea. Why not? - Count me in. - Me too. Great. Okay, me too. Deal. I'm in too. Otti, we can't sell you. Surely you understand. When they look at your pudding face, they'll lose their appetite. - You're mean. - Nonsense. I'm realistic. Look. We could share the money with you, but... I don't care about the money. I want something out of it. I want to be fucked too. - Come on. Let's go. - Yes, I don't like it either. - Bye. - Bye. What about you? We don't want anything to do with this filth. Ah, the Salvation Army. No problem. We can't use such ugly birds and wallflowers anyway. If you rat us out, you'll get it. We've never ratted on anyone. Stupid twits. We wanted to helpJosef get 1,300 marks... and this was the fastest way. The girls will undress now, completely. We can't sell it to them sight unseen. Understood? Get naked? You're crazy. Listen. Egon is right. To land guys for you, we need to know what we're offering. - You already know. - Yes, you, Christa, but the rest? The boys are entirely right. How's that for goods? Man, Otti, we really can't use you. The customers would slip on your grease. Screw you. I'll get some action regardless. All right. Now for the rest of you. Don't be shy. Fine. I've got nothing to hide. - Me either. - Same here. If you see my breasts, they'll take your breath away. Good quality. Top sirloin. There you go. - I have a problem. - What would that be? I'm still a virgin. I could fix that. Are you crazy? Touching our assets? As a virgin, Angelika is worth 100 extra for the first time. That's a premium. Our headquarters will be the Rio Caf?. We'll find your johns there. I'm telling you, guaranteed virgin. A 16-year-old schoolgirl. A schoolgirl? I'd be interested. - Can I see her? - Back there, to the left. Get Angelika and tell her to show her stuff. Angie, swing by that guy. I think he'll go for it. - She's really a virgin? - That's why her price is so high. You've got yourself a deal. Should she come to you or how do you want to do it? I'll take her with me. My car is right there. I'll bring her over. - Deal? - Yes, all clear. I think he wants me. What should I do now? - Close your eyes and think of the money. - Sure. Okay. We did think only of the money, most of the time. A hundred marks a trick. For special requests, a bit more. We became an insider's tip for real connoisseurs. They're crazy about schoolgirls. Every afternoon, we had one or even two guys. We even had a contest once. Who'd get the most guys between 3:00 and 7:00? I won, I had five guys. It was an engineering conference, with many delegates. In the hotel where they were staying, I was handed from one room to the next. Angelika made the most money. Her selling point was that she was still half virgin. Once she had her ears boxed... by a manufacturer who's daughter was exactly her age... and she got 5,000 in cash for it. We lived and we loved. Suddenly, we were rolling in money. The boys and us, we had tons of money. We didn't need anyone's permission. - Great, eh? - Yes, paid in cash. I like it. How much? 490 marks. I'll take it. - Do you want it wrapped? - Yes, please. Five bottles of champagne, that comes to 170. - Make it 200. Live a little. - All together? Yes, sure. A schoolgirl, just turned 16. Sweet as sugar. A schoolgirl, just turned 16. Sweet as sugar. We see misguided young people... parents who don't care... incompetent teachers... and beyond that in life... sophisticated temptations in the form of advertising... forcing people to shop and shop... constantly trying to keep up with others... the addiction of always being up-to-date. It becomes so easy when young people put money first. It may be carelessness, or superficiality... or morbid greed for boosting one's ego... or whatever. The shocking fact remains... that 16-year-old girls and 16-year-old boys... from one day to the next... become whores and pimps. We got busted because Egon tried to sell Angelika... to the father of a classmate. What a mess. The school went nuts, the youth services, thejudge... they all told us that we were corrupt. I'm only 16, and I think they're right. I shudder to think of the kind oflife we would have led. We had to show you these scenes... because our report on the dangers girls are exposed to... would not have been complete without it. Because you as parents cannot be too careful... or you daughter will one day have too much pocket money. Schoolgirl pranks, 1972. Here we have Margit, Ilona, Jessie and Doris. They are the best four of their class. They think this entitles them to extra benefits. - That was quite cold. - You're right. Who cares? This way, I save the money for ice cream. Hold up the towel. I hate these wet things. It won't kill you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. See, you're dry again. Imagine that. The guy looked under my towel. He saw every inch of my little treasure box. - He was staring at it? - With eyes this big. - What did he do then? - What do you think? He just stared... but he wanted to touch it. - Let's arouse him. - Yes, let's do it. - Good idea. - He won't forget us. Take off your bikinis and show yourselves to him. Cold water makes it shrink again. - That didn't take him long. - He's coming back. I'll stoke his fire again. Just watch. Can you help me do my top? The top? Sure, anytime. The clasp is stuck. I can't reach it. Hey, you're tickling me. Cold water makes it go away again. - Poor guy. - He's gone flat twice now. - We showed him. - I showed him. When he touched my breast, he instantly blew a fuse. How does a man's hand feel on your breast? You know that. No, I haven't been touched yet. Don't tell me you've never done it. Sure, I'm not a baby. I need it at least three times a week. Three times? I would have starved with only three times. I also do it myself four or five times a day. And you didn't break your finger? - You're just showing off. - All talk, no action. No, I'm telling you. I need it like others need bread. I don't believe it. What do you want? I'm 100 percent sensual. Look at him now. I do bodybuilding to become handsome man. Really? How exciting. I'm training for competition to become Mr. Rimini. I am from Rimini. After I am Mr. Rimini, I become Mr. Italia. - Then Mr. Europe and Mr. Universo. - Can I feel your muscles? Man, as hard as steel. Girls, you've got to feel this. Really? I'll have to see for myself. - Man, so hard. - And his thighs. It's like granite. He must be a big hit with the ladies. Touch him here where he's starting to shake. Hair like a puppy dachshund. Maybe he has some flabby spots. If he knew what he's in for, he'd go back to Rimini. Watch, the fun's starting. - Stop. - Give us a lift. A moment, per favore. - Take me. - Take the bar. - There's only one bike and one seat. - Let's go. Mamma mia. I want to ride his rod. Girls, you're confusing him. Come, Mr. Body, we know a great detour through the forest... that will get us there much faster. I give up. Crazy idea, taking a bike through the bushes. - This is nice here. Let's rest. - What? Rest? Sure, we're not monsters. We don't want to break Mr. Rimini. But why rest? Drop your bike, man. Hey, spaghetti, show me your muscles again. I want to see them again. I didn't try them all. I touched the wrong ones too. No need for glasses. Don't be shy, spaghetti. Show us your macaroni. Still as hard as before, but he's still holding back. - What a muscle! - The Leaning Tower of Pisa. Standing there alone is not allowed. What a beautiful man. So that's what you put in the cold water. Girls, I'll go first. And people say Italians are tiny. Vesuvius is erupting. - He's a wild man. - I make love to you. Amore! My God! Mamma mia! You know what I do in Germany? I am sewage worker. Here we go. Like jackhammer. Not there yet. Only a sample drill. Wait. Let's try again. I can't go on. Don't worry. I'm only getting started. I deserve a little pleasure. Look at that. He needs four women. That's not a poor dog, but a poor pig. - He's coming. - Mamma mia. Don't look, they'll corrupt you. I'm done for the next three years. Next, please. Enrico getting warmed-up. - Let's go in the water. - Then, I'll take you again. Stay. Why you leaving now? Enrico just getting started. Look here! I'm Barbara Heimbach. I'm 16. That's my brother Wolfgang. He's 18. We both attend high school. They not only go to school together, they also live together in one room. Education is open to anyone, but decent housing? Here are the facts: The father is a clerical worker... the mother, an unskilled factory worker. They can only afford rent for a three-room apartment. I like my brother. We're inseparable. When one of us is invited to a party, we both go. The 16-year-old Barbara and 18-year-old Wolfgang... have to share a room... during the riskiest stage of their development... when they become sexually aware. Look how that silly cow is putting her claws into Wolfgang. She's too old for him, but he's going along. It's a bit too loud here. Why don't we go somewhere else? What do you think? Come along. Are you afraid of a grown woman? Unbelievable. My Wolfgang falling for that dumb cow. You're just my type. Let's see how far they go. Silly me. I shouldn't worry. I know my Wolfgang. I like young, strong boys. Kiss me. Touch my breasts. You have good hands. I knew you would be good. You're so good. See my nipples? They're so hard. Kiss them. Kiss them. - It's finally you. - Yes, Father. Who else? - Where have you been? - At a party. I don't want you roaming about at night. It was just a party. Don't be so strict with the children. Come to bed. Don't tell me how to raise my children! Strict, but fair. Next time, you'll be in bed by 10:00. - Good night. - Good night. Drill sergeant. - Was that for my benefit? - No, why? - Lucky you. - Good night. I'd secretly watched my brother undress so many times. But the thought of wanting to have him, physically, I mean... only came to me that night when I saw him do that woman. I'd always idolized my brother, everything about him. That night, he became a mere mortal again. Are you asleep? Did you hear me? I asked you a question. How can I hear if I'm asleep? - But you're not asleep. - So? Was it that beautiful? Leave me alone. - Was it beautiful? - What? - The thing with the girl. - Like many others too. Don't be coy. You know what I mean. I saw you. Nonsense. - I saw it all from the very beginning. - What did you see? I saw you do it... on the bench in the garden. I saw you leave and I followed you. You spied on me? No, I didn't know what you were up to. You were really watching? Yeah. I wanted to see how it works. Then try it for yourself. With whom? Don't be silly, there are many nice boys out there. Why don't you do it with me? Are you crazy? What do you mean? I'm just as beautiful as that silly cow at the party. Sure, but unfortunately you are also my sister. But first I'm a girl like any other. Be reasonable. You got too excited tonight. That happens when you watch. But it will pass. Go to bed. You don't understand. You don't like me, be honest. Good night. Why are you doing this? I'm here. - Why don't you do me like that cow? - You're crazy. What's that noise again? Can't I have my peace and quiet? You know I have to get up at 5:30. I have to work for you. Good night. Barbara's case is a textbook case for psychologists. Stress at school for the mediocre student... and her ambiguous feelings oflove ofher brother... have triggered an exaggerated sexual awareness in her... that has taken perverted forms in her dream world. What's this? Didn't I tell you to go to bed? In Barbara's pathological dream world, distorted images take turns. You, Susie Bergemann, are charged with seducing Wolfgang Heimbach... the brother of Barbara Heimbach... thereby destroying the divine love between brother and sister. You are sentenced to death. Fusiliers. Ready. Aim. Fire! Now carry out Barbara Heimbach's sentence. She is sentenced to die. Because of a forbidden sibling love. Ready. Aim. Fire! Orgiastic dreams of a confused young love... that cannot distinguish between right and wrong anymore. I woke up dripping with sweat... like so many times before. Schoolgirls today... precocious and with access to more information... than any previous generation. More critical than ever... but also as romantic as ever. Despite the candor with which one of the most crucial topics... for girls is being discussed... Iosing one's virginity. I'm Sybille Redinger. I'm 18 years old. I'm Anna Dorn. I just turned 17. I was 18 when I lost my virginity. I was 16 when it happened. I just wanted to put it behind me. I hesitated for a long time until it happened. I'm a romantic. Without love, I couldn't have done it. Georg Hold has been my boyfriend for almost three months. He's 27 and in advertising. We see each other almost every day, but we haven't done it yet. And he doesn't like that. Darling, you must give in. I've been extremely patient. That's why I like you. - You're considerate. - Of what? Of me, my parents and the fact that I'm barely 18. First off, you have a funny idea of considerate. Most girls are mad when a guy doesn't take them. And second? I don't give a shit about your parents. I want you, not them. - You want me to deceive my parents? - What's it got to do with deception? They don't ask for your permission to have sex. You're mean to say that. Nonsense, which brings us to the third thing: Your age. You're 18, old enough. You're like a madman today. It's not a matter of age, but of maturity. You're not immature. Thanks for the compliment... but I'm not an animal only driven by instinct. No, you're the top of creation. Just make sure you don't fall. - You don't believe in love. - I do, that's why you make me mad. Funny idea of love. When two people love each other, they must get physical too. - I disagree. - That's where you're wrong. Well, then we have nothing more to say to each other. I can't force you. Where can I drop you off? - Stop. - Here? Yes. I never want to see you again. Don't be silly. We're good together. Oh, he's in trouble. He's actually quite nice. I'd like to do it with him. He could help me get rid of that bothersome hymen... that barrier to love that people make such a fuss over. He's alreadyjumped in. - Can I sit here? - Sure. - Just got brushed off, eh? - Things happen. - An espresso. And you? - No, I've had three ice creams. - Are you always so generous? - With a nice girl, yes. Nice girl? You mean if she sleeps with you? You're quite direct. - I'm right, aren't I? - I don't know. I just have a filthy mouth. - Your espresso. 1.20, please. - Thank you. Here. What do you mean a filthy mouth? Wanna bet I'm a virgin? Bet? How would I know? It's easy to check. Careful, I might take you up on that. - Are you in? - Okay, what's at stake? Honor, of course. Schopenhauer said it's not much of an honor... that women keep defending... which is just inches away from their ass. - What's your name? - Anna. I'm Georg. You're damned beautiful. - Does it matter? - I think so. It helps. - Why aren't you playing along? - Do I have to? I've never seen the likes of you. You talk like an adult, but you're clueless. - I'm starting to think... - What? - That you're still a virgin. - That's what I said. - Are you messing with me? - Not at all. Watch. You're funny. You come in here, talk nonsense... get naked. So you'd like to get served? Sorry, but we have a bet. Right, about honor. Lie down. I've informed myself about losing your virginity. If you do it right, the hymen can be pierced at once. It's supposed to hurt a lot. After the initial pain, you feel pleasure, they say. If you relax, you can even get an orgasm the first time. But only four percent of girls climax the first time, according to statistics. If the partner doesn't look after her... she can suffer emotional damage. Those become frigid... and those who feel disgusted can turn into lesbians. It's great to have all that information today. That hurt quite a bit. See? You're not a virgin anymore. - Are you on the pill? - No, it's my first time. Do you like it? It still hurts, but I can feel something. - You're so analytical. - Continue, I am almost there. Georg lost the bet, and I lost my hymen. I was happy to have done it. I wanted it myself. In the evening, Georg called and apologized. Everything was okay again. We didn't talk about it anymore. I didn't want to see Georg again. Sometimes we run into each other, it can't be avoided. But he's served his purpose. Four weeks later, my parents went on a trip... so Georg and I went on a little excursion. It was a great day. We acted like children. In the evening, he asked if I wanted to go to his place. I went with him. He's a big fan of music. We listened to records. We both fell asleep. Later, I woke up. "It's sweet how he lies there, '" I thought. At that moment, I knew the time had come. I love you. I'm a bit scared. Don't be silly. Come. - I love you. - I love you too. - What do we do now? - I have an idea. - I know, you only think of fucking. - Fucking has a future. I'm not saying I wouldn't, and you know that. Look, there's Georg. He's being all romantic now. She never let him touch her. "A girl can only give herself if she loves him with all her heart and soul." She can go turn into a prune, that romantic cow. - What's wrong? - Look at Romeo and Juliet there. Gag me. But just fucking around, that's not fulfilling either. What do you think? "Butjust fucking around, that's not fulfilling either. '" Empty words? Or an insight? We hope for Anna's sake that she really believes it. Because that special age, when sex plays such an important roll... will be over in a few years, even for her. Then, you look for a partner for all facets oflife. And then, sex alone is indeed not fulfilling. Schoolgirls today. Their desires, their dreams... their flaws and their virtues. Once again, we have given you the facts. Facts that make many parents despair. Sure, there are exceptions... but knowing them gives you a complete picture of girls today.
