GET OUT OF OUR RUT, DEAR ? OH! ? LET'S GET AWAY FROM IT ALL ? PA! BA DA! IT WAS 1957. WE WERE DRIVING FROM FLORIDA TO UTAH. AFTER MY MOTHER WAS BEATEN UP BY HER BOYFRIEND, WE GOT IN THE NASH AND HIGH-TAILED IT FOR THE URANIUM FIELDS. WE'D GET RICH AND CHANGE OUR LUCK, WHICH HADN'T BEEN SO HOT SINCE OUR FAMILY BROKE UP FIVE YEARS BACK. I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE SOMETHING THAT BEGINS WITH... "C." CACTUS. CACTUS. NOPE. NOPE. NO? UPWARDS. UP, UP, UP IN THE... CLOUDS. CLOUDS. YAY! O.K., YOUR TURN. I WAS CAUGHT UP IN MY MOTHER'S FREEDOM, HER DELIGHT IN HER FREEDOM. SHE'D GET RICH ON URANIUM, AND I WAS GOING TO HELP HER. ? I'M GONNA WASH THAT MAN RIGHT OUT OF MY HAIR ? ? AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY ? I'M GONNA WAVE THAT MAN ? ? RIGHT OUT OF MY ARMS ? ? I'M GONNA WAVE THAT MAN RIGHT OUT OF MY ARMS ? ? I'M GONNA WAVE THAT MAN RIGHT OUT OF MY ARMS ? ? AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY ? WE'LL TRAVEL ROUND FROM TOWN TO TOWN ? ? WE'LL VISIT EVERY STATE ? AND I'LL REPEAT THAT I LOVE YOU, SWEET ? ? IN ALL THE 48 HOW DOES THIS THING WORK, ANYWAY? WELL, I THINK IT CAUSES LIKE A, UH... IT MAKES A BLACK LIGHT THAT CAUSES URANIUM TRACES TO GLOW. SO WE CAN WALK ALONG THE STREET AND FIND SOME GLOWING URANIUM? WELL, IT WAS EVERYWHERE IN MOAB, THEY SAY. WE WERE TOO LATE IN MOAB. THAT GUY AT THE OFFICE SAID NOBODY'D FOUND ANY URANIUM IN SALT LAKE CITY. WELL, THAT MEANS WE'LL PRETTY MUCH HAVE THE PLACE TO OURSELVES, HUH? YEP. GOD, THIS COULD BE A BIG BREAK FOR US, HONEY. I MEAN, IF THIS WORKS OUT, JUST THINK ABOUT IT. WE COULD GET A REAL HOUSE, AND I COULD GET RID OF THIS DAMN NASH. WE...WE'D HAVE NO MORE MONEY WORRIES. BE JUST LIKE HEAVEN ON A JUNE DAY. HEAVEN ON A JUNE DAY. ? LET'S ? GET AWAY ? FROM IT ALL DAMN IT. YOU KNOW, IF I HAD ONE WISH RIGHT NOW, ONLY ONE WISH, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD BE? I'D LIKE TO BURN THIS GODDAMN NASH TO A CRISP. I'M SERIOUS. I HATE IT. I HATE THE MAN WHO INVENTED IT. I HATE THE FACTORY WHO PRODUCED IT. ALMOST MAKES ME WANT TO SEE ROY AGAIN. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD MAKE IT STOP OVERHEATING. MY GOD, HE WAS BORING. BORING AND MEAN. YOU SURE GOT CRAPPY TASTE IN BOYFRIENDS. COME ON. LET'S GO GET RICH IN SALT LAKE. [FATS DOMINO] ? BLUE MONDAY ? I HATE BLUE MONDAY ? HAVE TO WORK LIKE A SLAVE ALL WEEK ? ? HERE COMES TUESDAY... WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE, NOW. YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG, RIGHT? NO. WE CAME HERE TO LOOK FOR URANIUM. MY GOD, LADY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR URANIUM, WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO MOAB? OH, WE WENT THERE, BUT EVERYBODY HAD BEATEN US. WE WERE A LITTLE LATE. SO YOU CAME HERE JUST ON THE CHANCE YOU'D FIND URANIUM? YEAH. LISTEN, YOU MIND ME SAYING SOMETHING TO YOU THAT MIGHT SOUND RUDE? LADY, YOU GOT MORE COURAGE THAN YOU GOT COMMON SENSE. SO WHAT DID THE MAN SAY? DON'T ASK. [ENGINE WON'T START] MY MOM HAD HER OWN WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS. SHE LEFT THEM BEHIND. THAT'S WHAT SHE DID WITH THE NASH. JUST LEFT IT THERE. THINGS ARE GOING TO START LOOKING UP. CAN YOU FEEL IT? YEP. I CAN FEEL IT. THE GOOD TIMES ARE COMING. MY MOM HAD HIGH HOPES, ESPECIALLY FOR ME. I'D BEEN GIVING HER NO END OF GRIEF SINCE SHE LEFT DAD. I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO DO BETTER. I WAS GOING TO HAVE STRAIGHT-ARROW FRIENDS, I WAS GOING TO GET ALL As IN SCHOOL, AND I WAS GOING TO KEEP MY NOSE CLEAN. I PROMISED IT, AND I MEANT IT. WE GENERALLY LIKE TO GIVE NEW BOYS THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN 2 WEEKS THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF ME. NOW, I THINK YOU'D BETTER GIVE YOUR MOTHER A CALL, TELL HER TO COME DOWN HERE. SHE WORKS. SHE'S WORKING. IT WASN'T ME WHO BROKE THEIR STUPID WINDOW. OH, PLEASE. OH, GEE, THANKS A LOT. BELIEVE THEM INSTEAD OF ME. IF YOU CARE ANYTHING ABOUT ME AT ALL, YOU'D JUST BE QUIET. OH, YEAH. IF YOU CARED ANYTHING ABOUT ME, YOU WOULD HAVE STAYED MARRIED TO DAD. I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT. I KNEW IT WASN'T TRUE. MY FATHER WENT HIS OWN WAY A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY CALLED IT QUITS AND TOOK MY OLDER BROTHER GREGORY WITH HIM. SOMETIMES I HAD TO BLAME SOMEBODY, AND SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE. WHAT TIME IS IT? 7:00 ALMOST. WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP? I STARTED DINNER. THE POTATOES ARE FRYING, AND I'M HEATING UP SOME HOT DOGS. I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU ARE. HONEY, I KNOW YOUR FATHER DOESN'T CALL YOU AND YOUR BROTHER DOESN'T WRITE, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

I USED TO IMAGINE I SAW MY FATHER COMING TOWARD ME AND WAIT FOR HIM TO RECOGNIZE ME. I KNEW IT COULDN'T BE HIM, THOUGH. HE WAS LIVING BACK EAST, MARRIED TO A RICH WOMAN. HIS NICKNAME WAS DUKE, AND THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT OF HIM-- AS A DUKE LIVING IN A CASTLE FAR AWAY. A FEW MINUTES LATER, I'D PICK SOMEONE ELSE. [DOOR CLOSES] I'M HOME. HI, HONEY. WE GOING SOMEPLACE?

THIS WAS THE IMPASSIONED TESTIMONY THAT HELPED SWAY THE JURY TO ACQUIT 14-YEAR-OLD CHERYL CRANE OF THE MURDER OF JOHNNY STOMPANATO-- BOYFRIEND OF CHERYL'S MOTHER, HOLLYWOOD FILM STAR LANA TURNER. THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE AFTER A SHORT DELIBERATION, ALLOWING YOUNG CHERYL TO GO FREE FOR THE KILLING OF STOMPANATO. THE STABBING OCCURRED IN THE MIDST OF A HEATED ARGUMENT WHEN THE 14-YEAR-OLD GRABBED A KNIFE AND SAID TO HER MOTHER, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT," PLUNGING IT INTO THE STOMACH OF THE UNSUSPECTING JOHNNY STOMPANATO. HIS THREATENING BEHAVIOR WAS CLEARLY A FACTOR IN THE JURY'S REACHING A VERDICT OF JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE. A VIOLENT FINAL CHAPTER IN THE STORMY AFFAIR ENDS IN THE FAMOUS PINK BEDROOM OF LANA TURNER'S BEVERLY HILLS MANSION. [CAR STARTS] [EDDIE COCHRAN] ? I'M A-GONNA RAISE A FUSS ?

MY APPLICATION FORMS MUST'VE COME TODAY, AND HE THREW THEM AWAY. HEY, I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING HIM. THOUGHT I'D SAVE HIM SOME TROUBLE 'CAUSE HE'S GOT NO CHANCE OF GETTING INTO SOME FANCY PREP SCHOOL. ALWAYS GOT YOUR NOSE PRESSED UP AGAINST THE BIG SHOP WINDOW. HAVEN'T YOU, DWIGHT? WHAT? YOU'RE SO AFRAID THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO GET SOMETHING THAT YOU NEVER HAD. IT'S WHAT MAKES YOU MEAN. AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DWIGHT? ONE OF THESE DAYS, ALL THAT MEANNESS IS GOING TO SNAP BACK AND SLAP YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE. OH, I AM SO SCARED. I AM SO SCARED! I AM SO SCARED! OH-OH-OH! THIS IS ALL YOU GAVE ME FOR DINNER? WHEN I WENT TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION FORMS, I RAN INTO A WALL. THEY WANTED LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FROM TEACHERS. I FIGURED I COULD WRITE THESE MYSELF, BUT THEY WANTED MY GRADES ON OUR OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT FORMS, AND THIS WAS A PROBLEM. I WON'T DO IT. WHY NOT? YOU WORK RIGHT IN THE OFFICE. NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW. I'M SURPRISED YOU WANT HELP FROM ANYONE WHO FIGHTS FOR THE PINK TEAM. LOOK, I'M ASKING YOU FOR HELP, MAN. I GOT WORD YESTERDAY THAT I DID REALLY WELL ON THOSE TESTS, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. I'VE GOT TO CHEAT AND I'VE GOT TO LIE. IF THEY WANT As, I HAVE TO GIVE 'EM TO 'EM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IT'S SUCH A SIMPLE THING. YOU'RE THE ONLY WAY-- NO. WHY SHOULD YOU GET TO BE THE ONE WHO LEAVES? WHY NOT ME? [BELL RINGS] YOU COULD LEAVE, TOO, YOU KNOW. NAH, I'VE GROWN PROGRESSIVELY FOND OF CONCRETE. I THINK I'LL STAY HERE ALL ALONE AND DRESS UP IN MY MOM'S OLD CLOTHES SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU SAID. [SAW BUZZES] OW! OW! EXCUSE ME. I NEED SOME HELP HERE. FUCK. JACK! JACK, YOU GOT LETTERS FROM THOSE SCHOOLS! [LAUGHTER] HEY, WOLFF! BRING THAT BOTTLE OVER HERE. BRAND NEW WITH THE NICE SHINE AND EVERYTHING, DEFINITELY. OH, BULLSHIT. NOBODY IN YOUR FAMILY'S EVER EVEN BEEN IN A CORVETTE. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO OWN ONE, RIGHT? YEAH. GO DOWN TO THE DRUGSTORE AND PICK IT UP. I'M GOING TO MOVE DOWN TO SEATTLE, I'M GONNA GET A JOB AT BENDIX, AND THEN I'LL BE DRIVING TO WORK IN MY VETTE EVERY DAY. MY UNCLE CAN HAVE ANY CAR HE WANTS. MAKES BIG BUCKS AS AN ELECTRICIAN. OH, YEAH? HOW BIG? 175 A WEEK TAKE-HOME. BULLSHITTER. THE SUPERVISORS AT BENDIX DON'T MAKE THAT. THEN HOW WILL YOU MAKE ENOUGH TO DRIVE A VETTE, FUCKFACE? I'M GOING TO DRIVE A T-BIRD SOMEDAY. YEAH, AND I AM GOING TO OWN A VETTE EVEN IF I HAVE TO HOLD UP THE BENDIX PAYROLL TO GET IT. LOSERS. BUNCH OF LOSERS. WHO YOU CALLING A LOSER? JACKIE CALLED US LOSERS. [LAUGHTER] [GLASS SHATTERS] OOH! JACK'S TOUGH! ALL OF YOU. OOH, JACKIE. BIG, BAD WOLFFIE. YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE A FAIRLANE JUST LIKE YOUR DADDY DOES. TELL ME SOMETHIN', PSYCHO, TELL ME... HOW YOU EVER GOING TO DRIVE A T-BIRD IF YOU'RE A JANITOR LIKE THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY? YOU COULD FORGET ABOUT BEING AN ELECTRICIAN 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN PASS 10th GRADE MATH. WHO DIED AND MADE YOU KING SHIT, WOLFF? YEAH. YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN US. I KNOW. THAT'S MY POINT, PSYCHO. YOU GUYS ARE MY BUDDIES. YOU GUYS ARE MY PALS. MY DEAR OLD DAD'S CALLED DWIGHT. WELCOME TO BEAUTIFUL CONCRETE! WE ONLY TAKE BOYS THAT REALLY WANT TO WORK HARD. IS THAT YOU? I WANT YOU TO START EVENINGS NOW. AND I'D WANT YOU TO WORK ALL SUMMER. NO VACATIONS.

YOU SEE, BOTH MY FATHER AND BROTHER WENT TO PREP SCHOOLS. IS THAT RIGHT? WHERE? DEERFIELD AND CHOATE. I SEE! WELL, YOU MIGHT LIKE IT. UH, UH, HILL WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME, THOUGH. ACADEMICALLY, IT WAS HARD. AND THEN MY LAST YEAR, THINGS CHANGED. THE GUYS IN MY CLASS GREW CLOSE IN WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. SO CLOSE THAT--WELL, I STILL THINK OF THEM AS--AS SORT OF MY SECOND FAMILY. I WANT THAT. I DO. SO SHE SAYS, "NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT." I SAID, "OH, JULIE, WHY NOT LET ME GET DOWN AND GROVEL IN IT?" I MEAN, I ATE HER PUSSY TILL MY TONGUE WAS CALLOUSED. AND THEN I NOTICED THAT HER NIPPLES GOT NICE AND HARD. YOU KNOW, NOT THOSE BIG FAT NIPPLES, BUT NICE, HARD, RAISIN NIPPLES. SO ANYWAY, SHE GOES OFF LIKE THIS ROMAN CANDLE. I MEAN, THAT WOMAN CAN SCREAM. AND I SAYS, "YOU LIKED THAT, DIDN'T YOU, BABY?
