The Golden Triangle encompasses the delta area overlapping Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand. The area is responsible for 75 percent of the world's illicit drug trade. In February of this year, the Thai government decided it would destroy that drug trade, as well as the drug lord, General Samfon. The government sent out a specially recruited group of men which included many Chinese. Some men joined out of idealism. Some joined to get a US green card for their children. Some joined to escape from their families. And some joined just for the money. But they all resigned themselves to selling their lives at whatever cost in the middle of nowhere. Be on your guard! Don't slack off! Move quickly. Hurry up! Load that up. The product will be transported from here in Thailand through Cambodia to the Vietnam coast and then placed on board a refugee ship headed for Hong Kong. Yes, sir. Let's go. Protect the general! Handcuff him! Don't let him get away. Don't harm the general! - Guard him. - Don't hit the general! Start the jeep! Ah Yee! Ah Yee! Ah Yee, jump in the jeep! Hold it! Ah Yee! After them! Come on! Tell headquarters to put people on the Thai border. Get going! You can't get away. Tell me how much the Thais are paying you. I can pay you in gold. Release me, and you can stay alive. I advise you to not go up against me. This is my territory. You've already lost. No one's ever beat me. When I fight, I don't hold back. Get going. Auntie, is Daddy back yet? Not yet. Chan Chung said he'd be back by noon. What's going on? Daddy is always on time. He wouldn't lie to me. That fool will get himself killed for money. Chinese can be farmers as well as fighters. I don't understand. How could you just wait around for him for five or six years? My sister has been dead for so long. I'd hoped that you would marry well and let me live out my days in ease. I don't understand what you plan to do. Daddy! - Grandpa! - Daddy! - Grandpa! - Daddy! You killed my father! I hate you! - Let me go! - Stop it! Shut up, or I'll kill you! - Shut up! - Auntie, save me! One more sound and I'll blow your head off! - Auntie! - Shut up! Save me! One more sound and I'll blow your head off! Stop right there! - Let me go! - Stop it! Daddy! - General Samton in exchange for your son. - Don't move! Lay down your gun. Do it now! And the other one. You bit me! Don't. Easy. Are you all right? Daddy! - Daddy! - Keung-chai. Daddy. Keung-chai. Keung-chai, you've grown so big. Come on, give me a kiss. Your beard is hurting me. It's so itchy. Don't. The border is on the other side of this mountain. Black-pepper steak. Delicious. That smells so good. A little garlic, a little salt. A little black pepper. Black-pepper steak is really delicious. Stop that sniffing! More brandy. Twenty dollars, US, for the steak. How about it? You want to have my steak for $207? If we were in a fast-food restaurant in Hong Kong, that might be enough, but that's not good enough out here. You can't spend your life gambling. You may lose everything before you finally pass away. Back in Hong Kong, "Big Shark" was after me. That's no way to live. That's why I came out here. It's a good thing I can shoot straight. Thirty dollars more, okay? All right, let's throw the dice for it. Just one roll. Agreed. Large, large! Give me a large one! Six, six, six! I'll even wear a cuckold's hat. Even the cuckold's hat? Here's your cuckold's hat! This is your cuckold's hat! You enjoy that yourself! Twelve! Oh, no. My steak has turned into shoe leather! Never mind. I'll make your steak disappear. - Six. All six. - One, one, one! - One! Great! - How come I got a one! - Give this back to me. - The steak. Excuse me. Your luck is blacker than the black-pepper steak. Nice. Where did you get it? Off a dead black soldier. I carved it out of his butt. What? Human flesh? Daddy, let's eat together. Good boy. Dad's got it for you. Eat. Here. They're coming! Let's go! Hurry! Leave that behind. Hurry! Come on! Run! Hurry! Get in the car! Keung-chai! Hurry! Daddy, I need to pee. - Don't be long. - All right. Hurry back! Hurry, Keung-chai! - Hurry, Keung-chai! - Keung-chai, quick, they're almost here! Don't rush me! I'm coming as fast as I can! There's a car behind us. Let him go ahead. Stop! Stop! They've soiled our country's flag! Get them! Don't let them get away! No, no! Oh, my God! What has happened? What did we do? Keung-chai, don't go. We're going to kill you! We're your friends. Please, take it easy. Damn you! Who do you think you are? You pig! I'm a French reporter. I'm a reporter. - I'm a reporter! I am French! - He's only the driver. It's all a mistake. He's only my chauffeur! You cannot do this to him! - It's not fair. This is not right. - Please, listen to me! - He's our chauffeur. He's innocent. - Please! Let him go! Chop! Oh, my God! What's happening there? An execution. It's common enough. They are animals! How many times have I told you not to come along with me? I do what I want to do! - Go tell officer! - Yeah. Officer. Officer, you look like a reasonable man. Here. Here's my my passport. You can see I'm a French citizen. We are friends, no? - We are friends. - Friend? Remember Dien Bien Phu? - Open your dirty mouth. - My God! Open your dirty mouth! - Let them go. - Goddamn you! You're lucky. - Get lost now! You animals! - Get in the car now. Get in there. I'll handle it. No! Please. Please forgive her. She did not mean it. Oh, my God! Leave me-- Get away from me, you animals! What's going on now? Nothing much. Another one got his head blown off. Get away from me! Leave me alone! - Chin, let's get them! - Forget it. Don't get involved. Daddy. Help me! Save me! Please, somebody! Help me! Oh, God! Somebody help me! Please! The colonel's been shot! Open fire! I respect you very much. You are the best trackers. Help me hunt a man, a Chinese man. You can spot him easily. I can stand... to lose an eye, but I can't stand to lose my honor. You have no choice. If you don't obey me... I'll kill you, just like killing a dog. - Thanks for saving my life. - It's okay. Why have we stopped? Did it break down? We've run out of gasoline. We'll have to walk. Keung-chai. What do we do now? Walk! Go! Go! Their sense of smell is better than a dog's. I said it before. You can't get away once you enter my territory. Uncle. Are these yours? If you throw away your Buddha medals, you can't get Buddha's blessing. Take them back. Chin! Are you all right? Chin! This is gonna hurt. Chin, how are you doing? Big Man, are you okay? Are you all right? - It's okay. I'm fine. - Keung-chai? Where's the kid? Where is he? - Keung-chai! - Where is he? Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! - What should we do now? - Keung-chai is missing. Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Keung-chai! Set him on fire! More gasoline! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, save me! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Save me! Daddy! Daddy, save me! Daddy, I'm scared! Save me, Daddy! Save me, Daddy! Save me! Let me go! Let me go! Keung-chai. It's me! Daddy! Look, you got yourself all dirty. Close your eyes. You go that way. I'll go this way. Hey, come here! You've lost everything we had. How are we supposed to eat? Is there anything else you can gamble with? I have something. I bet her. You devil! You'd bet your wife? Don't do that! All right, bet her! Large! Large! Full house. You don't even get a chance to throw. Take her away. I see. Twelve-- full house. Full house is the sure winner. I get to play the good guy for once. Hey. I'll win your wife back for you. Let's play for this woman. Good. God of Wealth, bless me! Full house! God of Wealth has blessed me! God of Wealth shows up if you have a good heart. Full house. You don't even get a chance to throw. Don't try to fool me. Thank you. Hold it. Me first. Throw large. Large! A pair of eyes. Fool. Bad luck. I'll make you a sandwich. Sandwich! Sure enough! Is the sandwich good? Just think. Out in the middle of nowhere, and I make myself a fortune. So it's true. How much wealth comes to you in life is decided by fate. You want to play Russian roulette? Don't be afraid. There's no need to worry. These are our village guards. There's no government jurisdiction over this area. You are very safe here. The village chief would like to gamble with you. Sit down. Four pounds of the powder against what you've got there. You first or me first? Who throws first? Our chief says we are your host. You are our guest. You throw first. Great luck! I hope you are not offended. You are an honest man. The four-face Buddha-- protection from evil and bad luck? You first or me first? You first or him first? The chief says he goes first. No. You first. Large! I'm not worried about you, chief. I'm getting out of here. You can have all the money. I'll just go. The chief says that giving back the money is an offense to his honor. He must win it back in a fair bet. We have lost everything to you. This machine gun is our village's most valuable treasure. Our chief says that he will bet it against you in one final game. What? Are you trying to scare me? The final game? The chief says he is not trying to scare you, but it will be your last game. Hey, hey! Big brother. You first or me first? Large! Large! As large as my wife's belly. Amida Buddha, smile down on me. Your turn. Heavenly spirits, help me. I have to lose this time. Let my parents walk under a ladder. Let them bring me back luck. Let my kids open an umbrella in the house. If I make it back to Hong Kong, I'll change my stripes. Lose, lose, lose! After this awful experience, I'll never gamble again. Wow! It's a Rolex. Sorry. I'm getting rich. Let me put this away first. Gold teeth! I can put these gold teeth to better use. Let me go! Let me go! I'll shoot you! You dead ghost, you bit me. Search over there. Over here. Come on. Look around. - Go there and search. - Look around. So many bodies. See if there's anything valuable. - How dare you kick me! -1 didn't. It's gold. That came from back there! Search the area! Don't let him get away. Hold it! It's you! Where have you been? This bag is loaded with gold. -1 got this bag of gold. - That's great! The bag has a hole in it! I told you long ago that how much wealth comes to you in life is decided by fate. I gambled at dice and won a fortune. But now, I still have nothing. Live with it, brother. Hey! Where have you two been? - Chung is looking for you. - Let's go! What? Man's luck depends on fate. I'll pull it out. Try to bear the pain. Why did you kill him? If I didn't kill him, he would have suffered even more. Chau Sang! We sowed chrysanthemum seeds around your grave. You will never be lonely again. Think of us when you look at the chrysanthemums. You killed him. You'll pay for it! - Cool down! - I'll kill you! I'll Kill him! I'll kill him! Calm down. You can't kill him. What about Chau Sang? Can't you calm down? Stop crying. The trackers are here. If you pull the trigger, you're a dead man. Louis. Come on! Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Let's go! Don't leave me! Louis! Oh, no! Chan! For God's sake, don't die! How come you haven't been blown to pieces yet? You're not dead yet. How can I die before you do? It's only a matter of time. Hey! You can come on up! From now on, we are brothers because we have the same enemy. When it's over, you'll have Samton, and the Chinese is mine. It's a deal. The food has no taste. Where are you going? Hey, Keung-chai. I'll drag in a buffalo for you to eat. Yeah! I'd love that! Wait for me here. I'd rather have buffalo than eat this. Your reward for catching Samton is moving to the USA with your loved ones. You think the USA is a great country. Have you ever been there? America is no different than this place. It's dog-eat-dog. The USA is your native country. Why don't you go back? China is your native country. Why don't you go back? All right. Let's quit talking all this bullshit. Cheers. That girl is so pretty! It's worth dying for such a beautiful girl. - Are you Chinese? - I come from Hong Kong. Huh? You speak Chinese? -1 live in Thailand, but I'm Chinese. - Where in Thailand? - Chiang Mai. - Chiang Mai? So you're a Chiang Mai girl! Your skin is so white and smooth. No wonder so many people in Hong Kong want to travel to Chiang Mai. What is your name, Chiang Mai girl? Marsage. Marsage. "Massage." You must be good at it. Marsage, where's your family? Are they here? The army killed my whole family. I'm the only one left. That's so sad. What brought you here? The Thai government hired us to catch General Samton, the drug lord. Did you catch him? Yes, we caught him. Now we have to bring him back to Thailand by going through Laos. Then we hand him over to the Thai government. - Why are you doing this? - For the money. That's so good. Don't stop. So heavy. That's all right. Are you sure? Come on, let me try. Come on. Thanks. - Want a drag? - It's real good. I never touch drugs! You hear that? Somebody out there? You're all dead unless you surrender. Shut up, you bastard, or I'll kill you! - Daddy! Daddy! - Keung-chai, don't be afraid. Get down! Take cover! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Get over here! This house is full of explosives! Don't shoot! Get back here! One more sound and I'll shoot off your knees. Don't try anything funny! Auntie! I'm so scared! Auntie! I'm so scared. Don't be afraid. Calm down. Cease fire! Cease fire! - What are you doing? - Our general is inside. I give the orders here, not you. Understand? Blow that house apart! Destroy it! Burn it down! Destroy that house! Destroy that house! Destroy that house! Black group, retreat! Daddy! - Keung-chai! - Oh, no! Get down! No! - One, two-- - Three! Daddy! Catch. Don't try anything! Daddy! I'm out of ammunition. - Daddy! - Keung-chai. Keung-chai! Come back! Go! I've never lost before. Chin! Chin! Motherfucker! Chin! Get up! Get up! Chin! You can't die! Wake up! We're partners! We can't fight together if you die! Those bastards are coming! Wake up, Chin! - Let go of him! He's dead. - No! Who told you to shoot him? I want him alive! - Daddy! - Brother Chung! Daddy! Daddy! - Keung-chai. - Daddy! Keung-chai. You'll be all right. Take him with you. -1 can't leave you. -1 beg you. What about you? Forget about me. Daddy! Keung-chai! Daddy, I won't leave you. Push down on this when they come close enough. Come on, let's go! The French woman is gone. I want my daddy. - Is she behind us? -1 want Daddy. No! Are you scared? If we die, you die too. She's dead. - Let's go. - Move! An eye for an eye. You're pretty tough, aren't you? A Frenchman can stand one hour of this. An American, 30 minutes. We'll see how long a Chinese can take it. This is the place. Why is there nobody to meet us? No one is going to meet you. I'm going to save Daddy! - Keung-chai, don't go. - Don't worry. I'll find him. Keung-chai! Give me the explosives. If anything happens, blow him up. Where are you going? I'm going to find Chan Chung... even if it's only his dead body. Don't try anything funny. Move. No man can stand this for three hours. You're not human. Our game is over. Blow up. Blow up. They've come back! After them! Daddy. Daddy, are you all right? Go! He's getting away! Hurry! After him! He's alive. Hurry up. Why are you just standing there? We don't want to fight. Too many of us have died already. That Chinese has nothing to do with us. Why not leave it alone? We-- Come back! Come back! Get them! - I'll blow him to pieces. - No! We have to think. Tie them up! Press the button if you're brave enough, you fool. - Fool? - No! Don't do anything stupid! - Surrender now! - Calm down. Hand over the general, and ['ll let them go. If anything happens to the general, they're all dead! Don't! Julie, are you okay? Don't be afraid. I'll kill this walking ghost. No, don't! Don't fire! They're crazy. They'll blow us all up! Shut up and don't move! Please don't! Don't do that! Let me go! Get off me! No. Are we just gonna wait to be killed? We need to calm down and think. Julie. I can't stand it any longer. I can't stand it any longer! They'll come back. - My God! - No. - No. I'll think of something. - All right. It's horrible! Good-bye, my friend. Good-bye? I'll do this on my own. Don't be stupid. My life doesn't count for much. I love my country. I'm tired of being a deserter. I have nothing now. But you still have your son. Get away. Don't do this. Get out! The whole place is going to blow up! Get out! Let's go! Don't move! - Big Man! - Brother Chung. I can't go to the States with you. I did it to give you a stable home. Nothing matters to me anymore. But there's one thing I can't give up on. My son needs a mother. Daddy! Daddy, save me! Daddy! Daddy, save me! Damn kid! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - Keung-chai. - Daddy. Even if you hand me over to the Thai government... you still won't accomplish anything. I'll just spend some time in jail, but your friend is gone forever. Good-bye, Chinese.
