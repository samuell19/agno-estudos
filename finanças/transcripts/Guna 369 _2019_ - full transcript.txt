The first breath gives us life, and the last breath brings us death. Whatever good or bad happens, is what we call life. Between the first and the last breath, our life may get spoilt by our mistakes. But we should never spoil another man's life because of our mistakes. WELCOME TO THE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION - ONGOLE. FLOCK OF EAGLES. What happened, brother? -Who's inside? -Madam. What happened? We got into a fight with someone. It was nasty. Before we could respond, we were surrounded by people. Which village? Chirrikurapadu, madam. When death is upon you, the ears cannot hear good things. That is their fate. Is brother at home? Why will he be at home? Are you looking for a good time to step out? Don't you know that... before the news reaches us, he will be on his way. If anyone dares lay a hand on anyone from Gaddala Gunta... CHIRRIKURAPADU. Who are you? Oh God! Who are you? What happened, sir? Sir, sir... please let him go. Father! Father! Look at him. Sir... please let my son go. Sir... Please let my son go. Why are you beating a man from our village? Sir... sir... please let him go. Radha! Gaddala Gunta Radha! If someone still wants to be a hero, if you need fertilizers for your farms... if your children have to study, or even if you have to go to the hospital, you will have to come to Ongole! No one, who comes there, will ever return! If anyone retaliates here, your head will be in the backyard of my house and the rest of your body will be in your village! Please let him go. Sir, sir... looks like he may die. Please let him go. Sir, he didn't know what he was doing. Please let him go. Because you are telling me that he didn't know what he was doing... I am letting him go without killing him. Otherwise... BEACH ROAD. Why did you stop here? I’ll go get a bottle of water. -What do you want? -A bottle of water. Okay. Anything else? I want some condoms. BEACH ROAD. What's going on? You said we will go out for a bit of fun. -Oh God. -Please wait. -Please. -Please. Come on. -Please, dear. -This is not the right thing to do. -I don’t like coming out with you. -Nothing will happen. Leave me! Leave me! Hey! If you scream, I’ll kill him! Please... leave her. But you let him sleep late. And you wake me up early in the morning. Why, mother? Darling, give this to your father. I’ll make a breakfast for you. Go. Why did they send Kumaran Sri Ramachandra away? Think about it. Dad, please have some coffee. What is this? How can he send his own son to the forest? What, dear? Why can’t you let the TV be? He is preaching morals. What? And, they call these morals? How can anyone send their son to the forest? I won’t let my son even cross our threshold. Oh! Why do you care about all that? Just listen to the moral of the story. Watch some other stories. They talk about morals at other places as well. Keep this on. Okay. I love this show. -I am going to get my books now. -Come back soon. Okay. Mom! I am coming. Oh! Is the sun disturbing my son? What is it, dear? Hey, why are you screaming like that when our small child is sleeping? -Small child? -Yes. Wake him up. It’s already late. Hey, the longer he sleeps, the better it is for his health. Did your son tell you this? Hey, Guna! Are you still asleep? There's a fight going on outside. Son, don’t ruin your sleep for them. Enough! Shut up and go inside! -What will you do? -I’ll take care of you! How dare you talk to me with that attitude? -I won’t hit you. I will kill you. -What will you do? Hit me? Stop. Stop. Here take this. Take it, I’ll explain. This is perfect. Now beat each other up. Are you making fun of us? What is this, Guna? It is fun for whoever watches people fighting. Not just for me, uncle. Anyway, what are you fighting about, uncle? Hey, Guna, don’t you know how I worked hard in my childhood? How I struggled to educate him? How I struggled to get him married? I asked two extra feet of the property we are staying in, that’s it. For that, he says he will kill me, beat me up and stab me. -What did you do? -I, too, worked hard. You are fighting about the property. Okay. I finally got it. It will be 70 to 80 lakhs. It’s okay, you can fight about it. But after your fight, you need to pay for it, uncle. You will have to pay the police, the courts, the lawyers... the judges and the verdicts. After going around in circles for the next couple of years, you are still in debt of another seven to eight lakhs. You will realize apart from spending all the 70 to 80 lakhs, nothing is left. Expect animosity and grudge. If you keep fighting... not only will you lose the property but everything else. I don’t know how much courage does money give a man. But the courage another man can give you is so much more than that. Even if 100 people are against you, you will find the courage in knowing that... it’s up to you. Fight! If you want to let go of this kind of courage, I am not responsible anymore. You have to figure it out. Anyway, I felt like saying it, and I said it. Ah! He’s my son. He is the strength of our colony just like a rock-solid wall. Guna is a man of morals and he won’t let our internal problems outside. He won’t let the outside problems inside these walls. Is that all, uncle? I like you. But you may leave now. What the hell! Why is this so heavy? Hey, did you start eating betel leaves first thing in the morning? -How dare you poke me! -Hey, wait. Leave me, leave me. -Please listen me. -Leave me. Look at how she is poking me! You are no less... you are great... otherwise, I would have killed you. You are saved because of him. Leave it. Let’s go. Can’t you eat some rice as well? By the way, why do you always eat leaves? That one eats leaves. And these people eat you. What kind of society is this? When we want people to look at us, they won’t. When we don’t want people to look at us, they do. -Hello, Mr. Subbarao. -Hello, sir. Change your clothes here. You've come dressed up as a software guy and you have a tag. And I have to help you with it. Why is that work not done? -Go take care of that work. -Well... I have to... -Guna, are you done with the job? -Yes, sir. We need to export it to China. Go to the quarry and select a stone. Sir, I cannot come in for the next two days. How can you say that when there is such a lot of work? Well... I have B... I don’t know what exams you have been attempting for the past two years. What will you do after you pass the exam? Anyway, how does it matter? You are making 60 to 70 thousand rupees. Do you intend to make more money than that? And he’s waiting to display it on the wall, sir. Will the board be displayed this time at least? I’m wondering about it as well. Make sure the board is finally displayed. Somehow, I have to write the exam. Yeah. Come. Come. Come to me the 10th question on the 10th page. You are troubling me a lot. Come. Come to me. Come. Hey, Guna. Seems like this year you will fail as well. Destroy this inauspicious talk! -Come. -Wow. Come to me. You are so close. Come here. What is he doing? You are here now. Come here. What are these tantric rituals? Enemies are trying to disturb me. But I can’t lose focus. I will concentrate. Mom, call her inside. -Hey, go. -Go! Come to me. Write well and earn a degree. Here’s your hall ticket. Thank you, Dad. Cross my path and wish me luck. Why are you looking at me like that? Oh no! Last time when I wished you luck and you failed... your father refused to speak to me for three months. So, I won’t do it again. -Please, let me be. -You cross my path and wish me luck. He stopped talking with Mom, but he hit me... and wish me luck. Okay, at least you cross my path. And I don’t have a problem wishing you luck, but it’s not nice when men do it. That’s it. Let's see... if anyone comes and wish you luck. Wait. Listen to me. Did you scare all of them, Dad? They are getting scared themselves. I did not scare them. Anyway, why do you need anyone to cross your path and wish you luck? They need to be fortunate to wish you luck. Only those who are fortunate will come forward and cross your path. You go, son. You will pass this time. Oh my, look at the way he looks. If I see his face, I, not only will write my exam bad but I won’t even reach the exam Center. Let's change the direction. I knew it. What's this? I was feeling bad that no one was coming forward to wish me luck, and now you have crossed my path. Oh, are you going to write your exam? Sorry, buddy. Take this. Ah, no. It’s a sentiment. This one fell so don’t pick that one. This is my lucky pen. If you write your exams with this, you will pass your exams. You said, no one crossed your path to wish you luck, right? I will. My father asks me to cross his path and wish him luck every time he has some work. I guarantee that whatever work you do, you will be successful in it. Come. Today, you drank it so quickly. You used to take an hour to have beer. My dad’s wish is almost fulfilled. So... drink another beer. I quit drinking beer. This is my last beer. Why are you so shy? I don’t know whether she will agree or not. She? Who is she? She crossed my path today... instead of going on my path. And now, she is stuck in my heart. Why are you thinking about girls so much? You are unaffected when it comes to girls, right? What? I don’t know. When I saw her beauty, all my pride went away. Does she look pretty? It’s not about her beauty. Her personality inspired me. She has a good personality. From today, my family is not just the four of us. With her included, we are a family of five now. This is how we do it. Wow... what a pose. Hey, your dad is with the board. Hit it, Dad. Very good. I'll fix the board now. Uncle, but the results are yet to come. I will do it once my son tells me to do it. My son is gold. He will pass for sure. He is a brilliant student. He will pass the exams. Are you very confident that you will pass? What? Why is sir so happy today? Can’t you see the confidence in my eyes? Yes, I can see that. If you are so confident, then buy me a gift. Is there any link to your gift and his confidence? Hey, go. Dad, he doesn’t look like he’s going to pass, so stop putting up the board. If my son tells me, I will do it. So, Dad... You want a gift, right? I’ll buy you one. I think there is something wrong, dear. If there is something wrong every ten days or so, it doesn’t matter. Even if there is something off, it's better to pretend like it's not. Oh! What a royal look! Yes... yes... he is drunk, right? Now you will see the real royal look. Hey, what happened to the store that was here? I brought you here because it has changed. Come on. I have moved into the colony yesterday. They are quite close to me. They have to be close to me, not her. How are you? -Hey, Sahiti. How are you? -Yeah, I'm fine. Have this sweet. I have brought my brother and his friend. -Take this sweet. -I think that uncle has a sweet shop. No, this is his shop. We don’t eat carbs after 9 p.m. in the night, uncle. We don’t eat them, but we drink them, uncle. A liquid diet is good, son. That's even better. Go ahead, dear. Daughter, Sahiti has come. Show her the cell phone. -Okay, boys. -Okay, uncle... She is close to me. Hey, my sister is a goddess. Why because she asked you to buy a cell phone? You said you couldn’t see her then, right? Now take a look. It doesn’t matter if you hit me, but she is beautiful like Goddess Lakshmi. From today, you cannot call her, sister. Why? Because... how can my sister call the girl I love as "sister." Okay? -Okay, sister Geetha. -Again, "sister?" -Geetha, show me the cell phones. -Give me a moment. Let’s go. Excuse me. Can you give me a smile? I want a selfie. You can give me a smile, right? My dear darling. Stupid! Son! How come you are awake so early? I think if I go on the bike, then Geetha will fall for me. Will Geetha fall for you? I mean to say, my fate will change. Go, son. If your fate will change then you have to go. You give life To the imaginations of the heart Like a dream That you see early in the morning My poor heart is drowning In your intoxication Do you know what is happening to me? I am dreaming endlessly Do I believe this to be Some kind of sweet disturbance in me? Is this our first meeting? Is this my first taste of ecstasy? My heart is asking me to reach out to you Before I burn in this desire Is this my first taste of ecstasy? Is this our first meeting? My heart is asking me to reach out to you Before I burn in this desire -My desires have increased... -Is it so? -And have now become my every breath -Love! Don’t look at me like that and Cut my heart in pieces Should I accompany you like the Shadow that follows you around? Should I make a promise To never leave you and sign my name? Even though you are in front of my eyes You are tempting me with your smile... Every step I take is towards you Is this my first taste of ecstasy? Is this our first meeting? Before I burn in this desire My heart is asking me to reach out to you Is this my first taste of ecstasy? Is this our first meeting? Before I burn in this desire My heart is asking me to reach out to you Even though I have hidden you in my heart My love for you overflows Why are you so close yet so far, my dear? Like a cloud floating in the sky Raining down on me You walked into my life like an umbrella Over my head, my dearest I give you every bit of Silently tormenting me Even though you tempt me with your eyes me Is this our first meeting? Is this my first taste of ecstasy? Before I burn in this desire My heart is asking me to reach out to you Is this our first meeting? Is this my first taste of ecstasy? Before I burn in this desire My heart is asking me to reach out to you Hi, Guna. How are you? I’m good, uncle. Tell me. You were talking to me about your sister’s marriage, right? I brought you a nice alliance for her. I will send you the boy’s details. Okay, uncle. Please do. If you can send me your sister’s photo and her details, I will pass it on to them as well. Don’t send my sister’s photos now, uncle. -Why? -First. let us meet the boy and decide if he is okay. -Okay, uncle. -Okay. Bye. Mom! Oh, you're here. Come, Dad, sit down. Sit down. What do you think of him? I have got a match for my sister. Hey, come here. It’s your selection, right? The boy is nice. Ask him to come to meet us for fixing up an alliance. Wait, Mom. How can you just look at a photo and ask him to come home? We have to send our girl to a home where they will look after her even better than we can. True. -Greetings, uncle. -Greetings! Are you talking about a match? Nothing, we were just talking about an alliance we got for my sister’s marriage. Whoever that is, is dead. What does he do? We don't know much about him, but here is his photo. How is he? Looks like I have seen him somewhere before. What’s his name? -Sashi Kumar, I think. -Sashi Kumar. Are they from Narsingi? He used to study well in those days and you know how I studied anyway. Really? Does that mean he is a good guy? I only know him from back then. Anyway, you want his details, right? Let’s go find out. Apparently, he owns a medical shop now. Hey, wait. Don’t we have to do this on an auspicious day? We are not going there to fix a date for the marriage. We are just going there to have a look. Anything, related to my sister, however small it may be, we have to do it on an auspicious day. Can I take him to the factory now or should we wait for an auspicious day? Let’s go! -Namaste, brother. How are you? -Hi, Sharat, what brings you here? Nothing, brother. I wanted to discuss a small land problem with you. Tell me. Two months ago, my friend and I bought a plot together. Since he had some issues, I paid for his share as well. Now the rates have skyrocketed. He wants me to pay him at the current rate. If the rate had fallen, would he have given it to you? Call him here. Let me talk to him. Brother, you will have to talk sternly, as Radha is involved in this matter. Hey, stop those machines! You said coming here is a small problem. But this is a big problem. The plot is not more important than your life. Give it away. Because Radha is on the other side. If Radha is involved, then it’s better we back down. Go. Hey, Sharat. Since I said no, you may go looking for political leaders and other ways of help. But it’s Radha. Radha makes all the political leaders shake in fear. This guy is your follower, I believe. Radha is involved in this. He is involved in this settlement after knowing about it. Also, he says he knows the MLA. Once they hear Radha’s name, how can they hear another name! If I come to know that you knowingly did this... Sit down. You got this post because of peoples' votes. I got this post because of the people I stabbed. This should not happen again. Go... Go and try to sell the plot. Don’t lose it. Don't lose your life! Brother, is Radha so powerful? Oh, yes. What did you think? He’s very powerful. But he’s close to me. Really? Is it? How would you know the relationship I have with Radha? You are a newcomer to this place. Go do your work. You are interested in everything else but your work. Go! I’m going. Your phone is ringing. I’ll answer it. Okay, sir. I’ll get it done. Oh, no! No, stop! Oh, no. I broke my phone. It's a new phone. I need to take it to the cell phone shop and get it repaired. Oh my! What tactics! You go and change your clothes. I will get the bike. Oh my, what tactics! Why is this breaking all the time? I don’t understand it as well. Is it happening only now or did it happen even before this? No, it’s happening now. Why is it happening now? How would I know that? You have to tell me that. You need to tell me about it. I mean, how will I know about cell phones? That's my height. Who asked you to grow so tall? That’s why I grew so tall. That’s it. Girls like tall people, right? Great achievement. How is the screen guard breaking without anything happening to the phone? If you break the screen guard it's just a hundred rupees. What do you mean? But if you break your phone, the cost would be more than two to three thousand rupees. What do you mean by breaking it? It's breaking on its own. My friend can’t seem to articulate it properly, that's why he said that. Don’t pay attention to him. By the way, where did you break your phone? In the factory. If it broke there, why bring it here? There are many mobile stores on the way here. -She is asking you. Answer her. -Let me think about it. -Yes. -You. Okay. We have come to your shop. If there are so many shops in the world... why did we come to your shop? Think about it. Hello, Kamal Hassan. I have a good reputation. My name is Guna. If I come to your shop, others will come to your shop as well. Then your shop will have a good business and then you will be happy. And if you are happy then I will also be happy, right? That is what we want, right? Hey! We don’t need an Oscar. Let Kamal Hassan be. Sit down. I will be here. I'm comfortable. I have seen people talk for hours on their phones. But, for the first time, I am seeing someone who is using his phone as an excuse to talk for hours. He’s like a small child who cannot even hold his phone properly. How sad. Who? Is he like a child? Why don’t you carry him then? Do you know how to repair a cell phone? Yes, I do. Ah, these days even my phone is not working well. Have a look at it. Wait. We can’t repair your phone. Why? Why can’t you do it? We didn’t like your cell phone so, we will not repair it. How can you not like my cell phone? Yes. We didn’t like your cell phone. Hence, we won’t. We will only repair it, if we like it. Brother, did you listen to her? She's like a cart’s wheel. She's making noise. Call her a cart’s wheel or a mortar. Don’t disturb me. I am feeling love right now. Right? Oh my, his tactics! Look at what he’s up to. And you call him a small child, who cannot even hold his cell phone properly? Can’t see all this drama. Hey, what are you doing? I will leave soon. I never thought I would close the shutter like this and forcibly talk to a girl. Geetha, please listen to me... When you see a girl, you may be attracted to her. When the attraction increases, then love starts to grow. If this love has to remain life long, then I need to open up and tell her how I feel, right? I don’t even know how to propose. Because of that, all these days, I have been roaming around you like this. But somehow I feel, you look at me like just another person who is after you. I am not ordinary. I want to marry you. And then have kids. When they grow old enough to fall in love, then you tell them that... that is why I fell in love with your father and he loved me a lot. And then they will say... we can see that he loves you. Doesn’t he love you the same way even now? Trust me. I will love you all my life. I will always care for you. My love for you has given me the strength to talk to you like this. You don’t have to talk to me. Just talk to yourself about it. Ask yourself, why haven’t you stopped a guy from talking to you like this, while you look into his eyes. Ask yourself. Ask yourself, okay? You will ask yourself. -Really, bro. She is super. -Yes. Even though she’s mad, she looks very hot. Yes, she looks very hot. -Hey, look there. -What curves! Look. Look. Ah, Dad, stop the bike. What happened, Geetha? Just a minute, Dad. Do you have any sense? -Hey, let’s go. -Come. -What is it, dear? -Just a minute, Dad. Hey, here. Take this. Take it! Wait. Hey, don’t remove it. What are you doing? What is this, dear? You are also mad like that girl. Geetha, you have done enough. Come. Wait, Dad. Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Hello, he’s my son! Such a nice boy. I'm proud of you. Geetha, dear, let’s go? Oh no, the whole town is looking at him and are casting their evil eye on him. Hey, what is this? Why are you taking off your shirt? -Hey, come here! -See you. Coming, Mom. Come! Evil eye? On him? -Here, wear this. -My son is a gem of a guy! Hey, Alia Bhatta! Pick the leaves and give them to me. Bhatta! Why are you calling me Bhatta? Bhatta? So, what if it's Bhatta or Butt. First, pick up those leaves. Come here... -Hey, stop. Stop. -Old woman. Because he stopped me you are saved, otherwise... Here, eat your leaves. You just missed a gory bloodbath. Come on now. I have some urgent work to do. Yes, we will see. -Watch out. -I’ll be there in five minutes. Okay, sir. I will be in touch with you over the phone. Damn! Is this your urgent work? No, this time it fell for real. You won’t bother about my cell phone, but you take such good care of his cell phone. -I have to get my phone repaired. -Let’s go. Generally, the cell phone signal comes from the cell phone tower. But, look at how the cell phone tower has come to the cell phone shop to get the signal. Yes. He keeps coming again and again. This time it broke for real. Have you fallen for me? I love you. Why? Because you saw me put a shirt on, on that mad girl yesterday? Girls, don’t just fall for guys who help mad people or give food to orphans. That is why I fell for you. I like the way you are. Will you look after me, just like he said you would? Who? Our son? Ah! My sweet darling! It’s hard to believe that This is not a dream You have changed the whole story, my girl I will always hold your hand and not let go You have made it so, my man I can’t believe, so I have to pinch myself To know this is real The pain I feel is making My heart burst with joy My stomach hurts, laughing so much At the way you are jumping about in joy Now you have to get used to this My darling My sweet darling Your beauty is sweet and spicy My darling My sweet darling Your antics are making me even more shy I can see new paths form, In my hometown right in front of my eyes That is how it is That is how it is when you are a couple I can’t remember the days I spent with my loved ones anymore When you fall in love, This is the magic it creates I have to give you So many kisses I have to send these kisses through the air Till I have breath left in me I am right in front of you Why do you tease me like this? Now you have to get used to this My darling My sweet darling If your antics get out of hand They will become a crime My sweet darling Don’t keep me away from your beauty The moment I touched you I feel like luck is finally on my side Enough of this Reduce your praise I am giving you this life and my next life, It's up to you now See, how the madness is increasing in you Many have said these words I have heard all these words before There are so many wonders in empty words Okay, we have said these words before You have heard them everywhere I will show you in action, anyway Now I have to get used to this, my darling My sweet darling All your antics, I will like them on Friday My darling My sweet darling Your beauty is making a garland of flowers Here's the shop... stop. -Tell me, sir. What do you want? -I want a bottle of alcohol. The liquor store is there. -This is a medical shop. -Really? I need some water for my alcohol. Give me some. Hey, what is this? Hey, Sashi. Give me some water at room temperature. Are you Battu? Why will you recognize people like me? It’s been so long. Sorry, bro. He’s my friend, Guna. -Please sit down. -Come... let's sit and talk. Sit down. -How is the shop running? -There you go. There is no problem. It’s quite peaceful. What do you do, by the way? We break stones in a granite factory. -Where do you live? -In Ongole. I keep coming to Ongole. Call me when you are in town next. We’ll meet. How come you opened such a small medical shop? You studied well back in the day and said you had to get a good job. Sometimes things do not work out the way we plan. This is life. I understood that my parents couldn’t afford to give me a higher education. That’s why I started this shop. My parents are happy. I am even happier. Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Tell me. Hey, what work do you have with his phone? Wait a minute. That's the passcode. Hey, do you have any sense? Why are you using the phone? Boss, we will leave now. Hey, wait. I’ll be right there. -Just two minutes. -Hey, no problem. We will meet. Let us know the next time you are in Ongole. Don’t forget to call me. He seems like a nice boy. He's sweet. Yes. He’s a nice guy. Looking at his medical shop, I don’t think he makes enough money. You have to think about that as well, right? I don’t know about all that. But I know he’s a responsible person. I am sure he will take care of my sister very well. What about his education? If you work hard enough to eat and a place to stay, that's enough. They will be happy. What else do you need? Hey, if you are happy. I am doubly happy for you. Wait. Let me go and talk to him, right away. Hey, wait. Let me have a word at home. Yes, tell me. Tell him I told him, so. Okay. Hey! Have you lost your sight? Sorry, brother. No. You said something, right? Say that again? If I was going on the wrong route, I would have hit you as well. So... So, you mean to say that I made a mistake? I made a mistake? You said, "Have you lost your sight" or something. No, brother. I did not say that. Yes, it is nice. No, you said something. -What is that? -I will do not it again, brother. -Wait, I’ll just come. -Please, brother. How dare you tell me if I have lost my sight! Hey! What are you doing? Do you understand? Who are you? Hey, what's this? He’s my friend, brother. Brother, they are my family. Please let them go. Please let them go. The dangers of the world can come in any shape and form, Guna. If you want our people to be safe, you need to tell them. I am letting them go. I know you from childhood... What were you doing? Hey, do you have any sense? What about you? Do you know who he is? He would have killed you. Why do you have to interfere? My heart stopped for a moment. Battu is your friend, right? If he’s your friend, then he is like a brother to me. If anyone lays a hand on him then how can I keep calm? Tell me you are sorry. Hey, go. Tell me. Hey, you. I will break up with you. Hey, Go away. Why am I getting so many Facebook requests these days? Oh! It’s her birthday! Happy Birthday, darling! Thank you, dear. Only wishes? Do you want a cake? Don’t act smart? Hey, I am talking about cutting a cake. Really? What do you want then, darling? Will you give me whatever I want? I will give you whatever you want. I want a nice gift. Okay. I don’t want an ordinary gift. Then? It has to touch my heart. Oh, it has to touch your heart. -Where is the gift? -Here’s your gift. What is it? Open and see for yourself. It's an extraordinary gift. Why did you slap me? What is this? You asked for something that will touch your heart, so, I brought you something that will touch your heart. You are so stupid. You are fit to be in a museum. What a laugh? You... -Hey... that's right. -Shut up. You say... -I'll kill you. -Hey... what happened. Hey, this is for you only... I’ll go and get a water bottle. Oh my! Why is my body getting hot? Be cool. Hey, dude. Her profile is fantastic! What do you mean? Her front and back profile. I don’t know who's her boyfriend but he’s very lucky. Yes. He’s not just lucky. He’s very lucky. She is so hot! How come we never come across people like her? Why will we get such women? She looks like a nicely roasted corn on the cob with spices. Hey! What is this? Enough of this nonsense! Hey, you. What do you think of yourself? Hey, let me teach you a lesson. Hey, I'll break your bones. Come here. Come here! Hey, where are you running off? Hey, you... I’ll kill you. What do you mean shameful? Black as a crow! Hey! I will kill you guys! Why are you running away? If you have the courage, come face me. Hey, please run away. -Leave me! -Run. Let's go. What happened? Why are you hitting them like that? Maybe we can stop the tide from flowing but not a woman’s anger. What did they say, by the way? Well... They spoke badly about me. You got angry for this? They gave you a compliment. Is this a compliment? They said your boyfriend was lucky to have you. I am lucky, right? They said you look sexy. You are not just sexy, you are more than that, my sweet darling. Won’t they give a compliment, then? My darling. They said you look superhot. You are hot. Why should you have all this anger towards them? Lose your anger now. It is nice when you say these things to me. Maintain this feeling, I will take you away from here. Okay? Let’s go. Why are we here? You said you wanted a gift, right? Let’s go. I simply said that. No. Not simply. I decided to give you a gift, so let’s go. It will suit you perfectly. Take it. -I like this one. -Which one? -What’s so nice about it? -I’ll take this one. This one will suit you. That is not nice at all. This is nice. Excuse me, isn't this nice for her? Yes, it is nice. Take this one. This is nice. Don’t worry about the cost. I will take this one. No. I liked this one. Okay, give it to her. What did I say now? Take it. Guna, since my childhood I believe that my selection is good. Okay. I love my dad. But if he says he’ll bring me, someone, who is better than you, will I accept it? Till now, my family has been the best thing in my life. From now on, it's you too. So, what now... that ring, right? Okay, pack that ring. My dear, you are the breath I take I have been born just to love you I can spend a hundred years In the garden of flowers My dear, this life of mine is yours With you, I am part of you I am always following you This is the truth, the only truth We both are one Even God blesses our union In this auspicious time In this second, both halves of our bodies become one The sweet taste of your lips is divine No one should say anything about it. Take care of the merchandise. Okay, brother. Namaste, brother. Hey, waiter. Send them to another table. Clean it up. Clean it fast. Two minutes, brother. Hey, clean it fast. Hey, it’s Radha. Gaddala Gunta Radha. He looks good, just like his name. Where is the beer, brother? Hey, how long will he take with our order? Look at him, they served him so quick. No one cares about us. Hey, where is our order? Brother! Hey, I did not hit you on purpose. Really? Hey, you! Who the hell are you? How dare you come here! How dare you hit Gaddala Gunta Radha! Hey, you idiots! Oh no, what have they done! -Now we are dead. -We hit him without knowing who he is. Catch them! Run! Run! Hurry! Wait! We didn’t know he was Radha and we hit him. Let’s go! Bow down your head. I am going to behead the ones who touched me. I want them! Only then I will lift your heads up again! Hey! Where are those idiots? RESTAURANT AND BAR. Now, what do we do, bro? What can we do now? Why did you fight with Radha of all the people? Fighting with Radha is like picking up sticks for our own funeral pyre. Brother, please you have to help me. I only have you guys. He was about to hit me with a bottle, because he was about to dash into me when he was coming from the wrong side of the road. Otherwise, I would have been dead by now. Guna came and rescued me at the right time. So please ask him to help me as well. You told me that your friend knows him very well. Boss, please. I generally don’t get into fights. I was trying to save my friend and now I am caught in the middle of it all. That time, because he knew me from childhood, he let him go. Also, he stays right next to us, in the next lane. If something goes wrong, he will create a scene at my house. Sorry, boss. Please understand. Please convince him. If something happens to me, my entire family will be on the road. My father is not well. My family needs me. Please... Please, boss. Please help me one time. If you help me one time, you will be saving my entire family. Why are you insisting so much? I came to you that day regarding something. But today you are making me rethink everything. Also, you say that if something happens to you, then your family will be homeless. So, even though I have a small doubt that something may happen to my family. I am risking it for you. I am doing it only for your family. I’ll go to Radha and talk to him. If he agrees, it's fine. If he doesn’t, then I can’t do anything. You guys figure it out. I am not responsible. -Please try to convince Radha. -Hey, Guna. Do we need this? It’s okay. It's about his family. What is it, Guna? I want to talk to brother. There is a small issue, brother. Is there a problem? No, nothing like that. It’s about the small fight that happened in the restaurant the other day... and the guy who pushed you is someone I know. Tell me. What should I let go? His life? Or my respect? No, brother. You should not let him go. You should kill him. That is what is going to happen now. But, brother... What is it? When there is a poster of the Prime Minister on the wall, a passing cow can chew it and spit it out. But that doesn’t mean the cow has no respect for him. It only did so because it had no knowledge of him. These guys are also the same. Had they known it was Radha, they would not even have sat down, let alone laying a hand on you. Brother, if they lay a hand on you without knowing it was you, then how is it laying a hand on you? Brother, you are Radha. You want to catch them and kill them. What do we do now? I will bring him here and he will fall on your feet and apologize. You will make him apologize. Yes, brother. Ask him to come here. Here? Okay. Not here. I will come there. You decide a place and let me know. Thanks, brother. Tell me. Everything is fine. -Radha has agreed to compromise. -Really? He also asked me to decide on a place to meet. Ask Sasi to be ready tomorrow. I will take him there. How can you compromise with the guy who touched you? Compromise with Radha. Let him come here. Where are you off to? I am going to meet a friend. I will be back in an hour. Go. Hey, why are you following me? To see you. Where are you going? I have some work. I should be back in an hour. Yes. I am sure. Sure? You said you had some work, right? Go and come. I have to go out in twenty minutes. Brother will be here in two minutes. Why are you so tensed, boss? I spoke to him. You just have to say sorry and we are done. Okay, boss. Brother, I told you... Thank you for coming. Come. He’s a good guy, brother. Hey, say sorry. He will tell you sorry, brother. Hey, say sorry. Why are you hitting him, brother? Brother, please leave him. He is asking for apologies... Leave him, brother. Hey, move. Sorry, brother. I have made a mistake, please forgive me. Please forgive me. I am sorry. Brother, please leave him! Please don’t hit him, brother. How can you get away by saying sorry after laying a hand on Radha! Leave him, brother. Brother, please! He says he is sorry. You said you will let him go. What is this? Brother, please! Leave him! Please let him go. He didn’t know it was you, brother. Thanks, brother. Please! Leave him! Fall at his feet. Fall at his feet. Fall at his feet. I am sorry, brother. I didn’t know it was you. -Please forgive me, brother. -He didn’t know it was you, brother. Do you know who you are laying a hand on? Hey! Do you have any sense? I know. I am going to kill him! I have come to kill him. What will you do? If anything happens, I am going to die! What do you mean? Then die. Come! Come! Then die. Come! I’ll kill you too! Come. You can also die with him. Come. Brother, I am not responsible for this. You know me since I was young. I am not that type of guy. Please let me go, brother. I am not related to this. Brother! Hey! What are you guys doing? Don’t leave him. Kill him. Don’t let him go. Come here! Catch him. Don’t let him go. Kill him. Hey, come here. Come. Hey, Mastan. Come here. Hey! That’s it! Hey, no. Hey, no. Hey, no, please. No. Hey, no. Hey, no, please. No. Please don’t kill that trust. I brought him here on trust. Hey, no, please. No. Hey, wait... Tell me. Dear... Dear... According to the primary investigative report of the police, and after listening to all the victim testimonies... they have concluded that Guna is the primary suspect, in the murder case of Gaddala Gunta Radha... and that the accused is to be sent in for remand. The police have been ordered to further investigate the case, and catch the remaining suspects as soon as possible. Go on now. Come forward now. Go now. Go. How many people? Three of us. Three? Have you come for a marriage? Can’t you understand? Only two can go. Uncle, you go. Come on, now move. What is the name of the accused? Dad. Dad. Sorry, Dad. You were there to do some good. Who knew this would happen? Son. Son? Don’t worry. Sister? She said she wanted to come. But I didn’t want to bring her to such a place. Okay, Dad. You also do not come. You should never come to such a place. Ever! Please, Dad. -Guna! -Do not come here ever. I will come home. It's not like that, son. Till I come home, you don’t come here. -Guna... -Guna... It's time to leave. Let's move. Let's move. It's time to leave. Move... This is venom for heart It feels like a death For every second If I cannot see you in front of me My life becomes disturbed This is the devastation for desires My heart is crushed in them Even if life becomes heavy, The bittern pain will be shared by us The restlessness is making me sad The sky has fallen on me Like a bolt of lightning I’m unable to control my beating heart and has overwhelmed me like a deluge Without you, There are always tears in my eyes Knowing I cannot be with you, My heart is roaring like ocean waves The darkness never ends I don't know where you are? How do I meet you? Even when I sigh, I feel your breath Even in my sadness, I think of you I don’t know how I can free myself From this trap Surround on all four sides Why is it like this? Pain in me has been expressed In my sleepless eyes Like yesterday and day before, I am not with you today We were together in happy times We are still together in troubled times Sadly, our love has been sacrificed to fate Having faltered in the first chapter itself The story of our love is weeping Not knowing how it will end It is moving forward Without you, There are always tears in my eyes My heart is roaring like ocean waves Knowing I cannot be with you Don't know where you are? The darkness never ends How do I meet you? Even in my sadness I think of you Even when I sigh I feel your breath I don’t know how I can free myself From this trap Why is it like this? -Brother? -I'll meet to you soon. Is he back from jail? Uncle, how are you? I’m fine. I will meet you again. I'm just going out for some work. See you. Hey. Hey, bro... I went to see you at the jail. But they told me you had left. Come, get on the bike. Let’s go. No. No. I could lift my head high and walk around in this colony before. Today, I have to hang my head low. If you are next to me, you will also have to do the same. I am your friend. Get on the bike. I am telling you because you are my friend. I should have listened to you when you asked me not to get involved. As a friend, you are right for wanting to be by my side. But having you around me is not the right thing to do. Nothing will happen. When everything settles down, I will call you. Hey, what happened? Why are you like that? What happened to you? Oh, about that. This is such a small issue. I had work in the factory. I messaged you. Don’t take me so lightly. When I was very young, even before I could remember, I believe I would cry if my mother was not with me even for a second. Now, if you are not around, I feel like crying. I will not leave you again even for a day. Smile. Okay. Shall we go out tomorrow? I will never leave you again. What is it, dear? I wanted to meet Geetha... I know, Guna. My daughter talks about you. She told me that you are a good guy. And that you don’t like getting into fights at all. She says, "Guna is just like you, Dad." But what my daughter had described about you, are you still that? -It wasn’t my fault. -Let’s assume, it was not. If your sister got a marriage proposal from a guy who has been to jail... would you let her marry him? -Will you do it? -I mean... I explained the same thing to my daughter so that she would understand. That it's not right. Drink this milk. Drink it. Here, put this inside. Geetha... why are you so dull? The boy is coming to see you tomorrow. You need to look your best. Now drink your milk and go to bed. Not like that, Dad. Go to bed. Then, why have you brought me up? You know I'm right, and that my choices were right from my childhood. Now, I feel this is also right, Dad. You chose everything for me and I thought it was right for you and that is why I never opposed you. But... now I don’t feel this is right, dear. That was a mistake Guna made without knowing. A mistake is a mistake, even if it was done knowingly or not. Forget it. I am a simple man who thinks of what will happen to his reputation if people saw a police van near his house. How can I make a son-in-law of a man who’s been to jail? What is this, Dad? Why are you worried about people? A reputation is like a weight we carry on ourselves unknowingly. Great! Great, dear. What you said is right. We taught you about good and bad. But, once you grew up, you are teaching us lessons with a tight slap on our face. If we agree with whatever you say, then we are good. If not, we look like the devil, right? Not like that, Dad. What do you mean? The worries of children are not their own... it is the worry of the parents. If you are even a little sad, we feel sadder than you. Okay, dear. It’s your wish. Even after I told you all this, if you still want to be with Guna, you can leave now. Even if you marry the one I choose for you or if you marry Guna, I will be there for you. Because I am still your father. But after you marry Guna, you will not take those seven steps around the holy fire... but around my funeral pyre. My daughter has taken a good decision. As a daughter, she hasn’t let me down. As a lover, she hasn’t let you down as well. I am your daughter, Dad. I cannot marry someone else, and promising to be with him all my life. This is venom for heart It feels like a death For every second If I cannot see you in front of me My life becomes disturbed Till now the best part of my life was my family. From now on, it's you too. You are my life You are love You are with me Stay with me My heart yearns for you I look for you I want you by my side You and me are meant to be Forever and always I need you, my love I need you I can only live in your light I need you What has my family done? Brother, it’s my fault. -Hey, no! -If you want, kill me, brother. Leave my family, brother. You want me to leave your family, right? The pain we felt when our brother died, you should feel it too! -Hey! -Guna... Hey, I am telling you don't do this! -Dad! -Dear! Brother... Dad... What is this? My son is gold. Because he doesn’t want to trouble me, so he works hard himself. He used to proudly tell everyone about this. Then why have you brought so much trouble here? "He won’t trouble me", he said. Let us observe him for an hour. Hello, doctor? There's nothing to worry about. He cut his hand, so there has been some nerve damage. But he’ll be fine in a year’s time. We will shift him to the room this evening. Doctor, can we see him? Any one of you can go inside. Nurse, give me the medicine slip. Go and see him. Hey, dear... Come. Are you crying? What is it, son? What is it, son? Is it because they cut my hand? It's okay. You are there now, son. It's enough for me. Your sister... Take care of everything, son. Don’t cry, Mom. Don’t cry. Nothing will happen. Sit down. She will be back. I’ll get her. Take care of Dad. Nothing will happen, she will be back! My sister will be back. People like us get scared of people like you, and sit quietly if there’s a fight, not because something will happen to us! But... do you know... if something happens to them, then it is not fear that you will see, but something much more! Go inside. Nothing to fear. Go inside. Go. I’ve risked everything and come. I will burn you down. Did I kill him? How do I know who your enemies are? If not these guys, then someone else would have done it. Do whatever you like with me. I told you it was not my fault. What has my family done? Come on. Come you, idiots. Come. I am here to answer one person. I didn’t do it on purpose, madam. I went to do good and came across evil. But even I asked them to do whatever with me, they unjustly chopped off my dad’s hand. If you want to kill someone, then kill me. But leave my family alone. Why are you talking about my family? Your father only lost his hand. My son lost his head. I had to cremate his headless body. What did you say? Kill you? If we had to kill you, the moment you stepped out of the jail we would have killed you. If we wanted to kill your family, we would have killed them the moment you went to jail. I wanted you to know how it feels when something bad happens to someone you care about. I am going to make your mother and sister homeless. I am going to make your dad run around like a mad dog. What? Since you have come, you were saying you were going to burn us down. Let’s see you do it. If we lose ten people, there will be another ten. Then another ten people. They will keep coming at you. Will you stop them? Because you said it was not your fault and are worried about your family, and have fallen on my feet begging for mercy. I will give you a chance. You have only a week’s time. I want to see the death of all those people who murdered my son. You have to catch them. Even if an hour past the week’s time I gave you comes to pass... then whatever I said will happen, one after the other. After that, it’s up to you. It’s my fault. I helped those idiots. I have troubled my family. I have made her sad. What she said is right. I will not let anything happen to those I call my own. I will not let anything happen to those I call my own. Grief has left me, In a merciful time like this The life I wanted, Is now destroyed by the darkness Even though my tears cannot express The pain I feel in words I feel the anguish that Never seems to end Even though I tried to help It has only led me to the dungeons The culpability that was misguided Has now wrapped itself around you Am I not just a pawn In someone’s revenge? Even though I am walking into a nightmare Even though I haven’t committed a crime I am now a criminal All the beautiful love I had Is now withering away The help I gave without thinking Has fulfilled its justice By placing the blame on me Even though there are many directions I am now directionless My tears cannot express The pain I feel in words I feel the anguish that Never seems to end Even though I tried to help It has only led me to the dungeons The culpability that was misguided Has now wrapped itself around you -Sit down. -Uncle? Did you find out anything about them? Sorry, bro. Just like everyone else, I didn’t want to get involved. But I feel like telling you about it. Raghu is someone from the batch. He used to work in the same shop like me. He has a lover. I saw them once... in Bhagyanagar at an apartment. When I inquired, I came to know that the girl lives there. Maybe if you ask her, she may have some information for you. Thanks a lot, uncle. Tell me. About Raghu... Who’s Raghu? I know Raghu is your boyfriend. Will any girl tell you about her boyfriend, if you ask her? She will tell you... if you can give her something more than her boyfriend. What will you give me? I will give you whatever you want. Come on. Here I am, burning up because someone set me on fire. And you are asking me to stand still so that you could warm up. Okay. Okay! This is wrong. A woman who loved me dearly gave up her life for me. When she valued me so much, I cannot do something meaningless like this. When a woman promises someone that she will be with him forever... she will be with him till she dies... like my Geetha. Because of women like you, everyone thinks all women are like that. They are not. Women are not like that. They are very sincere. Wait. If you really love someone, then they are very sincere, is what I learned by looking at you. Raghu came by recently. I don’t know where exactly is that. But I know he’s in Ongole. Come. We will play the game "Police versus thieves." I am the police and you are the thieves. Yes, we are ready. All the thieves in their place! We are hiding in his spot and yet, why hasn’t he caught us? He doesn’t know we will hide here. My grandfather used to say that... if a thief hid in the police’s house then even the police cannot catch him. We are thieves, right? He is the police. How will he know that we will hide in his place? He will never guess. Tell me. What do you want? Sir, will you tell me if you know the police? For what? Sasi and his guys are in Ongole. What do you mean they are in Ongole? The police have combed through the whole of Ongole. How do you know that? They are hiding in the police's house. He’s in Ongole. How will he catch us? If a thief hid in the police’s house even then police cannot catch him. You said it yourself that... the police have combed through Ongole. But still, haven’t caught him. You are talking in frustration because you haven’t found Sasi’s gang. Are they someone great, that the police will support them? Before you believe in something, don’t you think if it’s right or wrong? Okay, sir. Tell me. What do you think? What should I do? Which way should I go searching for them? Sir, my situation is like being in a desert. I cannot see anything else but sand dunes. I am very thirsty. At that time, I have found only a little water. I do not have the time or strength to think, if that water is good or bad. I will have to drink it to quench my thirst. If you believe, then tell me. Otherwise... There is an SI in One Town called Sivaji. I will call him. You go meet him. Yes. Cool. It’s okay, sir. Have it. It's nice. So, you mean to say they are still in Ongole. And that too in the police's houses. Yes, sir. Or if I am mad to listen to this. I don’t know if you are mad for telling me this. Tell me. Do you want me to listen to you and look in the police's house? As far as I know, they have no relations or friends in the police. Look here. After the murder, they escaped us here and are said to have gone to Anantapur. We are in touch with the police there, as well. Don’t know how, but they escaped the police there too. No, sir. You are looking for them in the wrong place. Really? Why do you speak like a blind person, when you can clearly see? I can see clearly, sir. But the direction I am going is pitch dark and scary. I am hopeful that I may see a ray of light somewhere. Come. Sir, no, sir. Take it. Will I save this money and build a building? Do one thing. Go search for the light. -You come to the station. -Okay, sir. Hey, elderly person, what is it? -You’ve asked me to come and meet you. -I will take care of the case. Okay. Is that all? I mean... Listen, elderly person. If we asked you to come here and not to the station, you should understand. Ah, I understood. -Only, you can get him out. -Think your work is done. Okay. That Guna is not an ordinary fellow. He has information that even the police don’t. He was discussing it with me, not knowing that I am the police who has given you shelter. If he has found out so much, then he is sure to catch you soon. There’s no doubt. Hey, it’s Guna. You go open the door. Open it slowly. It’s you. What is it? We met that time on that matter... I told you there itself. Well, sir. What is it? -A bribe? -I mean, sir. It’s only because I know that person who introduced us, I have kept quiet. Otherwise, I would have put you behind bars then itself. Sir? What do you think of me? Hey, get away from here. I am telling you! Why are you coming in like that? Sir... sir... Go! Let’s go. Let’s go. Run! Run! The drum of Lord Shiva is making a sound Dham dham dham dham When the raging torrents make you run Like Keechaka You will be killed in sacrifice The drum of Lord Shiva is making a sound Dham dham dham dham When the bolts of lightning make you run Many demons are killed in sacrifice Won’t evil be destroyed If it infuriates the heart of a saint? Won’t destruction be eliminated If a kind-hearted man wants revenge? Won’t brutalities end If Lord Shiva is after you? Won’t the terrorists be disposed of By Lord Shiva if He sets his mind to it? Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... Oblation... oblation... These feet are on fire This is the destruction of evil The graveyard is where The courageous Lord Shiva resides This is the calm before the storm This is an act of fearlessness This is the rage of one Who had drunk the poison and absorbed it Thank you for calling me now. Don’t worry. We will catch Sasi and his gang, and hand them over to Radha’s mother. Okay? Then we will be out of this fight. Dad? Hello, Guna? You said your son was like your right hand. But for a few days, you will not have your son, Dad. What are you talking about? I have taught a lesson to whoever betrayed us. I am going to jail again. Son... what do you mean? I will be the son you always wanted, Dad. But once I am back from jail... Hey, son. Leave all that. Come to me, son. Come to me. Guna? What are you talking about? Why would you go to jail again? I will cut them in pieces. I will not spare anyone who’s betrayed me. I will chop them up. What happened to you? Do you have any sense? If you know where they are, why not take them to Radha’s mother... and let her decide if they want to cut them up or kill them? Why are you getting involved? Do you want to go to jail again? Why have you become like this? How much do you love your friend? If you really loved me so much... then why did you do that? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Radha has agreed to compromise. Everything is fine. He also asked me to decide on a place to meet. Okay. I will take him there. Ask Sashi to be ready tomorrow. What happened, Battu? It’s done. Guna will come and take you. If you fall on Radha’s feet and ask him to forgive you, then you will reach a compromise. If we apologize then we will survive. What do you mean? He’s Radha. He will hack you to pieces. Then what do we do? What will you do? Either you die by Radha’s hand or he dies by your hand. What if we run away? You want to run away. Where will you go? Do you want to run away leaving your family behind? If he finds them, he will slaughter them, and you will not even know! Then what do we do? Either you die or he dies. I told you, right? Hey! How can he dare to kill us? We will only kill him! Yes, we’ll kill him! You said you were my friend, stay right next to me and betrayed me. I didn’t do it on purpose, brother. He hit my dad. He dragged my mother. He beat up my brother. We lost our respect in front of our whole village. That’s why I did it. I’m sorry. Hey, why are you saying sorry? You reacted because he attacked your family. Didn’t I kill, when my family was involved? You have to kill. If you kill then you are the son. I wanted to leave them after I beat them up to my heart’s content and that is why they killed him out of fear. They were scared that Radha would kill them. Because your family was attacked, you behaved that way. That is why, even though it was really difficult, I thought I would bear it... and let it be. But... But... that police said something. If I let you go even after listening to that... then it will be my mistake. Hey, there was no fault of mine. Not your fault? It was not my fault. Not your fault? No... Not your fault? Not your fault? I need to talk to you. I am outside. A little outside of town. It’s okay. I will come to you. Brother, I have to speak to you urgently. Okay. Hey, what a figure. Hey, look. She made us enjoy a lot that day. Yes... You were the one who said, "let’s not take a video." Because of the video he took, now we can enjoy it. But that day, we had good fun. Whatever it is, this girl was great. He came with him and married him. Hey, Battu. She is the one who is saving us all. We are happy because of such girls. She was born to satisfy us. Which father will be able to bear it, if we show his naked daughter around town? Right, brother. He knows if he talks about us, this video will go viral. Now, he has to keep quiet and watch, no matter what we do. Till there are wrong girls like that, wrong guys like us will always have fun. This is fun. I can do this for the rest of my life. What is it? At this time of night? Brother... Brother that is... the threshold of Guna’s house, he will kill himself. Brother, Dad is saying that if I ever cross I won’t marry anyone else, but Guna. But I don’t know what to do. Help me, brother. I don’t know anyone but you. Brother, these people... Brother? Brother, you... You... Leave me. No! No! Leave me. Leave me. Hey, what are you doing here after getting us this super figure? He cannot do it. You think he is some big man or what? Hey, aren’t you a man? That is the girl you brought us. Go. If anyone lays a hand on him then how can I keep silent? Don't do this. Don't do this. Hey, untie her. She may tell someone if she goes out. If this video goes viral, her father will have a heart attack. She will not. Her boyfriend, who is in jail will go mad. She knows it. That's why I did a little more. It was fun. She was super fun. Hey, give me a cigarette. Hey, instead of going home, she is going up there. Hey, first light the cigarette, brother. Here. No matter how high she goes, she has to come down. Where will she go? Unnecessarily we have brought another one on our heads. They will think that since the parents didn’t accept her lover so she committed suicide. If there is a postmortem, they will know everything. Hey, the police we have has to do something. He will manage everything. To protect my own daughter, I could not save your daughter from this injustice. Please forgive me. He is the ruler He is here All bow down to him The ones at fault will fear He is the master of masters He is the king of kings The evil will be doomed Only truth will reign She thought you would be her support, called you brother and came to you. You killed her instead of saving and protecting her. Please, no. What do I do with people like you? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? This one... This! This! These are the videos you take! Damn! This is the video that has to go viral! Are you filming? Are you? Take it. What? You betray girls and proudly parade around like men! Let him watch! Let him watch! You watch all irrelevant things. Now this is what you have to watch! Why am I killing him? What has he done? Either he won’t do it or he will stop another one from doing it! Courts may have no answers nor tears for guys like you. But the knife in my hand will teach you a lesson. Are you scared? Scared? Should I not kill you? Should I not? Brother, please forgive me. Sorry, brother. Forgive you? Forgive you? How can I forgive you? Forgive you? Brother, please leave me! Brother... I will never do it again. -Leave me, brother! Leave me, brother! -Brother... I will never do it again. Leave me, brother! She must have also begged like this. Did you leave her? Did you leave her? Did you leave her? How come they die just like this? Is that all? No, this is not enough. I need something else. I need something else. There has to be a bigger fear than death! What is it that I can do to make them feel that? What can I do? What can I do? If I do this, will you be scared of me? Will you be scared of me? Will you now not come onto women? Are you now scared? Can you feel the fear now? What I am doing is not wrong. This is right! From now on any man, who has a twisted thought and misbehaves with a woman, he has to piss his pants thinking about it! Will you do it now, you idiots? Will you touch them? Will you? In a serene life, if vengeance becomes a part of it... its peril is more dangerous than death. Because of our mistakes, the others should not be harmed. If it happens, then it’s not a mistake. It’s a crime. We can forgive a mistake... but we have to punish a crime. Guna created a sensation in Andhra Pradesh. The atrocities on women are increasing day by day. If we have to stop them, the laws should instill fear in them. "What I have done is correct", says, Guna. Many women welfare associations and people in the country are expressing their support towards Guna. My son, Guna is the rescue... for women like this who are targeted by rotten men. FEW YEARS LATER. A punishment should not just scare people. Not only will man change, but even those looking at him will change. CENTRAL JAIL. I love you, dear.
