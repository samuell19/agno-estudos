I spent all afternoon on this heap! There's not a speck of dust on it! - [Actor On Screened Movie] Captain, sound the alarm. It's coming toward the city. - [Captain On Screened Movie] Right, sir. (sirens on screened movie wail) - Kenny! If you really loved me, you wouldn't do that. - Do what? - You know what, with your gooey old tongue and everything. - What brought that on? - I just don't like it, that's all. - Why not, everybody does it. - Oh, well, then maybe we just better go. - [Actor On Screened Movie] There it is, Colonel. - Kenny! - Good Lord! I don't know if we'll be able to stop it. - But certainly the tanks. - John, John! I thought I'd never find you. I heard... John, it's getting bigger by the minute! - You promised! You promised, and you did it again, you pinned it! God, I'm going crazy, and I'm gonna be as crazy as you are! - Let me out. - Let yourself out! - Just let us out, Pete. - No! - Just come out, go around, open the door, and let us out. - No. - Why not? - Just no is all. - Malorie, we're through! You've ruined my night and my entire weekend! I never wanna see you again! (dramatic music) - Girls. - [Actor On Screened Movie] Hey, I told you to stay away from this thing. Haven't you caused enough trouble? - She broke up with you. Gosh, I'm really sorry, Pete. - [Actor On Screened Movie] Ever since you discovered this thing and started playing with it, it hasn't stopped growing. Now look what it's become. - Think she meant it? - Sure sounded that way. - Yep. Sure did. - John, what can I do? - I've got one suggestion. - You think I should've told her? - Don't play with it anymore! Get the hell out of here. - Told her what? - She gets me so excited, I can't even stand up, let alone open the door for her. (Kenny laughs) - Well, sure you should've told her. Girls love to stuff like that. (creature on screened movie roars) - Look out, Colonel! (woman screams) (doors bang) - [Blonde Girl] Goddamn Pete! - What'd he do? - All he ever wants to do is feel me up. - Oh, Sharon. - I don't wanna talk about it. - What am I gonna do? - What are you gonna do? - Yeah, I mean, this morning, Mom promised my grandmother that I'd look after her house while she's off at a buyer's convention. - [Sharon] So? - So, Mom said no boys. She was dead serious, too. If Kenny came over, and Mom ever found out. - She'd cut your tits off. Well, your mom. - And I'm afraid to tell Kenny about it. I can't have him over for a picnic or anything. - At least you've got a guy who'd wanna come over. - [Brunette Girl] But it's the 4th of July. Kenny's my steady! - I remember having one of those once, for six months, six months, three days, one hour, and 44 minutes. - Oh, Share, I'm really sorry. Hey, I know! Let's spend the holiday together! We can just both disappear. - And not even think about them. It's gonna be a long, lonely 4th of July for you and me. But I just thought of something, a terrific idea, so they'll never, ever know. We're gonna join the Sweater Girls Club. - Huh? (tense music) - Oh, tomorrow's the 4th. It's gonna be a big day for a lot of people. Least, I know it's gonna be for Judy and me, right, Judy? - Yeah, I'm real excited about it, too. I just hope it isn't too rushed. - Oh, it'll be worth it. By tomorrow night, we'll be full-fledged members in. - In what? - We're joining the Sweater Girls Club. - And what the hell is the Sweater Girls Club? - You'll find out. (tense music) (woman on screened movie moans) (men chattering) (relaxed music) (men shouting) - What are you guys doing tonight? - I don't know, what about you? - I have a date with Lynne. - You wish. - Would I lie to you guys? - If the opportunity arose. - Think you'll score? - Does a goose go barefoot? (relaxed music) - Aw, Jim, your next piece will be your first. - Yeah, try telling that to your sister. - Hey, what do you mean by that? - George! - [Jim] You'll figure it out. - Oh, well, funny she hasn't mentioned it. You think she'd be proud of that one. - Some girls are funny that way. - Shoot it, Jim! - Hey, that's what I'm gonna do tonight. - If you do, which you won't, the shock will probably kill you. - If I don't, the shock will probably kill Lynne. I've got her kinda used to it by now. - Yeah, you wish. - Hey! - Hang loose, you guys, I gotta run. - Hey, don't break up the game. - Get Henry, he'll play. Take it easy, fellas, or anyway you can get it. I'll be thinking of you bimbos tonight. - That yo yo can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. - You know, if he had half the chicks he says he has, he'd be lucky to weigh 50 pounds. - Come on, Henry, let's play, come on. - Ah, come on, Henry, you're on my team. - I quit. - Oh, come on! - I'm with you. - Well, how'd you make out last night? - The same. No, worse. She's on the rag. - So what? - It ain't sanitary. - Ain't sanitary, huh? - What ain't sanitary? - Never mind, Henry, you wouldn't understand. - Here it is the 4th of July, and we're playing B-ball. - Yeah. Maybe we should go down to the lake. Might be some chicks there. - Ah, I don't know. - Yeah, and I know where we can get some beer. - [George] Where? - Henry's old man. - Come on, you guys. - Hey, Sammy, you coming? - Yeah, I gotta go mow the lawn. I'll see you guys later. (lively rock music) ♪ I drive around town, hey boy ♪ ♪ Yes, I drive around town, hey boy ♪ ♪ I'm gonna make love tonight ♪ - This stuff tastes like piss!

You coming, Henry? - Where you going? - [Pete] Down to the lake. - Nah, it's too crowded. - Don't worry about it. We know a private spot, come on! - I better not. (lively rock music) (girls chattering) - Hey, hi, Lynne. - Hi, Lynne. - Hi. Hey. - Got you working today, huh? - Only a few more minutes. Boy, am I ever glad you guys stopped in. - You've already heard? - Heard, it's all over town. It's just awful, terrible, horrible. - [Sharon] Well, I don't think it's all that bad. - Sharon Standish, how could you? - Well, after all, I'm the one that broke up with him. - What, you and Pete broke up? I can't believe it. - Yeah, and she really, really loved him. He's so popular. - Oh, Sharon, you poor thing. - It isn't as bad as what you heard. - That isn't even what I heard. I had a date with Jim last weekend, remember? And we're supposed to go out again tonight. - Well, what's so horrible about that? - This morning, that crappy Penny came in here and told me Jim practically got on Voice of America about me. - [Sharon] And he said? - He laid me. - He didn't ! - He did. - He laid you? - No, he said he did. - Hmm. - [Lynne] All we did was neck a little. - I believe you, Lynne. You know, you're not the first girl he's said that about. He's even said it about me. - About you? Boy, is he a liar. - [Sharon] You know it. - I think I'm gonna kill him. - Oh, there's no need to do that. There are lots and lots of ways to manage this situation. - Yeah, with Sharon and me on the case. - Now, this stuff about your reputation, that's what you get for playing the field. - You might be better off with a steady. - No decent guy is even gonna look at me at this rate. - Oh, Lynne, sure they would. - Yeah, if you join the Sweater Girls. - The Sweater Girls? - Yeah! And you're in luck, initiation's today. - It's at 9024 Hollyhaven Avenue. Think you can find it? - Sure thing, what time? - Be there at two o'clock, and, remember, the password is lamb's wool. - 9024 Hollyhaven, lamb's wool, two pm. Got ya. - Okay, we'll see you then. - See you later. Uh oh, Joella Gilore, the mysterious whore. - Look out, Lynne, it's skag time. Let's get outta here. - Oh, no, that's all I need is the kids to see me with that tramp Joella. - Hey, hey, Lynne, it's me, come on, I need to talk to ya. - Gee, Joella, I would, but I have to close right. What happened to you? - What do you think happened? The usual, only maybe a little more so. - Just sit back there in that booth, and face away from the door, okay, do you mind? - No, anything you say, Lynne. You're the only one who's ever been nice to me. (bluesy rock music) - [Radio DJ] Hope you're enjoying this July 4th holiday. KMRT, Los Angeles. (Pete whistles) - I think there's a Ford in our future. - No, it's him, here. - [Judy] But! (tires screech) - Hey, Sharon! Gosh, Judy, I didn't mean to give you fits or anything. Here. Bet you think I'm really a creep, huh? - Joella Gilore's a creep. Henry Crankite's a creep. Maybe he's just a brain. But you, Pete, you could never be a creep. - I couldn't? See, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. - God, those guys from Fairfield, they just go (grunts), zip up, and roll you out on the sidewalk wherever you happen to be. God, never again. - [Lynne] Do you mean that? - Well, just look at me. - Do you really mean never again, Joella? - You mean, do I mean I'll never do it again or never do it again with a guy from Fairfield? - Never do it again, til you're married. - Til you're married? - The way it's supposed to be. - Til you're married? Oh, God, I wonder if anybody would marry me this weekend. Gee, but nobody will even talk to me this way. I'm not getting anything but laid. But what will I do with my time? I already spend hours and hours in the public library. The library closes at seven, and, after that. - Joella, what you've always wanted is popularity, right? Well. (romantic pop music) - [Judy] What was it you wanted to ask me? - Yeah, what was it you wanted to ask me? - Petey, you were gonna ask me something about her. - Who? Must not have been very important. - Come on, Pete, let's go! Come on, let's get going, all right? Come on, beer's getting cold! - [Pete] Looks like I gotta run. - Me, too, or I'll be late for you know what. - [Pete] Yeah, well, I'll see you. (romantic pop music) (tires squeal) - Well, what did he say? - Oh, I'll tell you later. - Hey, come on, get it, get it! Oh, Kenny, get him! Down, look out! (boys chuckle) - Tired, Pete? - A little. - Yeah, just like your Ford, old and tired. - Outrun your Pontiac any day. - (laughs) My ass! You must be dreaming. You get a little beer and it goes straight to your head. - There isn't a Pontiac made that can outrun a V8 Ford. - You wanna bet? - Yeah, anything. - How about a case of beer. We're almost out. Loser springs for the next one. - Yeah. - You bet your sweet ass. - Hey, what about Henry? - [Andy] Leave him. - You can't do that. Come on, Andy, put him in Pete's car. - That's not fair. - Why not? - Extra weight. - Don't worry about it, throw him in. - Come on, throw him in. - Wake up, Henry, wake up. - Come on, Henry, come on! - Come on, get up. - Let's go. Come on. Come on, will ya? Come on, come on, get down, watch your head. - Hey, if you're coming with me, come on, let's go! (engines rev) (birds tweet) (gentle music) - [Judy] What time did you tell Bonnie to be here? - [Sharon] About 20 minutes ago. - Well, I certainly hope she hurries. We could use a few laughs. (person knocks) - Guys, angora, um, cashmere. Oh, damn it, I forgot the secret word. - Hi, Bonnie. - Come in, Bonnie. (girls chuckle) - Hey, where'd you get the crazy sweaters? - My grandmother's a buyer for Miller's, Bonnie. - Chin-chi-chitti, so that's where you got the sweater idea. No wonder, no wonder. - That's not exactly how it happened, Bonnie. You see, we, no, forget it. The real story is too complicated. - Too ridiculous. - Too sad. - To go into it, I should've guessed. Let's get with it. (gentle music) - Lamb's wool! - [Sharon] Oh, that must be Lynne. - Geez, what planet, Janet? - What is it? - [Sharon] It's a Joella Gilore. - Set fire to it. - Better get her inside before somebody sees her. - Lamb's wool, damn it! - Joella, why are you here? - Well, golly, Lynne told me to come. Don't you believe me? - Well, I guess we have to. - Well, you better, 'cause, from now on, I'm turning over a new leaf. This morning or, gee, I guess it was about noon, I quit putting out. - Well, I never! - I know you never, but I used to all the time. - We know, and it's got you the lousiest reputation in three counties. - But I never did it for money, not a dime. - Then I give up, it's hopeless for this girl. - Listen, I know you guys don't like me much, but you gotta listen to me. From now on, I'm saving it for marriage. - What's left of it. - No more jaw jobs in the library? - No more backseat bangs? - It was usually the front seat, it used to happen so fast, but, no, no more. - Promise? - Yeah, and I wanna join the Sweater Girls. - Is she serious? - Well, look at it this way, the guys don't know where we are, so if we let her join, we're safe. - For today, anyway. - Please. - Okay, you can join. - We'll get you all fixed up, and you can run around with us and everything. - But, first. - You gotta tell us what it's like. - To go all the way. - Can't seem to remember. - (sighs) Really rich. - [Sharon And Judy] Oh, come on, Joella! - My sweater, girls.

We'll come back for it later. - Yeah, we're out of beer. (bottle shatters) - I'll be back, I promise, baby. Wait for me! (soft pop music) (doorbell rings) - Hey, it's me Lynne! I mean, lamb's wool! - [Sharon] Well, Lynne, you better tell us. Are we expecting anybody else? - When does Marilyn Monroe arrive? - What do you mean? Oh, hi, Joella. You mean did I tell the guys? Of course not, how dumb do you think I am? Don't answer that! Hey, you guys didn't, did you? - Positively no boys allowed. - This isn't a trick, is it? I mean, Jim isn't here, is he? - No, he's not here. - Lynnie, you're gonna keep that date. - Not this kid. - Oh yes, you are. - You wanna get into the Sweater Girls, don't you? - Then there's this little matter of your initiation. (gentle music) - You're what they call continental. - What's that? - Russian hands and Roman fingers. - What the hell? I wasn't trying anything. What's the matter? - Oh, nothing. (gentle music) Wouldn't it be easier if we got out of our clothes? (Jim gags) - What? - I said, don't you think we ought to get undressed? - That's what I thought you said. - If I take off something, will you? - Sure. (gentle music) - Your turn.

(light pop music) (door creaks) - Henry Crankite, you're peeking! - No, I just have to go to the bathroom. - Well, obviously it's not in here. - You sure are pretty, Lynne. - [Lynne] I thought you had to go to the bathroom. - I do, badly. - [Lynne] Well, don't you think you better? - That's okay. - No, it's not, Henry. I mean, it's bad for the kidneys. - Is it? - Yeah. It can cause complications in later life. - Well, then, I better go. You wait right here. - Sure, Henry, sure, cross my heart. - Okay then, remember, you promised. (light pop music) - I guess I just don't understand what you were doing in the kitchen with the lights out. - I told you, man, we were just talking. - Talking? Talking about what? - About you, Kenny. - Me, what about me? - Well, uh- - Just things. (tires screech) - The cops! - What about him? - Let's go! - Joella, where are you going? - I gotta go potty. - Go! - [Kenny] Hey, come on, let's go. - [Sharon] You guys better get outta here. - [Kenny] Pick him up. - [Andy] I got him. - [Kenny] Get his legs, head first in the closet. - [Pete] Okay. - Okay, I got it. (doorbell rings) (tense music) (cop knocks) - Okay? - Okay, let's go get outta here. (doorbell rings) - You guys better get outta here! - Out the back door. (doorbell rings) (tense music) - [Andy] Quick, in there! (tense music) - I'll get the front door. - Sorry to bother you, little lady, but we had a report of a burglar in the house. Are your parents at home? - Grandmother, sir. No, sir. - Mind if I have a look around? - Well, as you can see, there's no one here. - For your own protection, I better have a look. - [Judy] Yes, sir. (tense music) (boys grunting) - Did you hear that? - No, no, I didn't hear a thing. - Not me! - Stand back, girls, this could be dangerous. (tense music) Reach for the sky! Now what's going on here? (George snores) Did you girls know he was in there? - Yes. - No! - Now which is it? - Oh, morning, Chief, how's the crime business? Har-de-har-har. - What are you doing in there? - I just stopped in to take a bath. So if you'll excuse me. - I never will understand you young people. Why can't you all be more like my daughter? She'd never do anything like this. She's a lady. Anyway, I'll just take my beer to my car. Now don't you girls go away, I wanna talk to you. (tense music) (crickets chirp) - That son of a bitch, there goes another case of beer. - He shouldn't be allowed to get away with that shit. - He's going back into the house. (crickets chirp) Hey, I got an idea. Where the hell is Henry? - Joella. I hardly recognize you tonight. - It's true, there have been some changes made. - I'm sure you're still the same hot, I mean, warm-blooded individual I've heard so much about. - And I'm sure you're every bit as clever and inventive as they say you are. - Why don't we find someplace to be alone? - And talk? - Yeah. - Why don't you wait right here for me. I'll be right back. (dramatic music) - Hey. You look like you could use some sobering up. You're drunk! I see two of you. (Joella shouts) (George laughs) - You creep! (George laughs) (Joella whimpers) (George gurgles) - Joella? Gee, Joella, you're all different again. - Henry, it was awful! - What happened? Come on. You better get those wet things off. So, what do you wanna talk about? - Politics. Who do you wanna win the election? - You mean presidential? - Of course. - Well, confidentially, Joella, I've never liked Ike. - Me, neither. Stevenson, though. - Yeah, Stevenson. They call him an egghead. - Just brilliant, just a brilliant statesman. - [Henry] Brilliant. - I expect you all to act like ladies just like my daughter. And I'm calling that young hoodlum's parents to come get him right now. - No! No, we'll call them. - Well, all right, but you girls listen to what I say. - We will. - You bet. - Thank you very much, Sergeant. - Sorry you couldn't stay longer. - I am, too, but I have a job that must be done. Goodnight, girls. - Goodnight! - What the fuck? (comical music) - Quick, give me Jimmy's car keys. - [Driver] Look, give it a try. Are you so stubborn? Please! (tires squeal) - I'll get you, you son of a bitch! (tires squeal) Shit! (comical music) Goddamn bastards! When I catch you, I'll cut your nuts off! (tires squeal) Oh, what now? (tire whirs) (tires squeal) (tire whirs) What the hell? Goddamn it! Oh, no! (dramatic music) (cans clang) (Sergeant pants) (police band chatters) Goddamn! - [Judy] Yes? - May I use your phone? - Of course. Please, don't sit down. (girls chuckle) - You mean you've never had a girl? - No. - That's too bad. I wish you'd told me before. I mean, before tonight. - [Henry] Why? - Well, now it's too late. I'm not allowed to do it anymore. - Why? - [Joella] I had to swear off to get into the Sweater Girls. - The Sweater Girls? - Yeah, the club. - What club? - I wish I could help you out. - Boy, so do I. - Henry. Henry, I don't think it's a good idea, Henry. Henry. Henry. - Okay, smart-A, stop with the jokes, get somebody over here. You just wait til your parents hear about this. - Hear about what? We didn't do anything. - You know, somehow, I just don't believe that. And, believe me, they're gonna hear about it. When I think of all the trouble we went to to raise you kids, the sacrifices we made. (Henry coughs) (Sergeant speaks indistinctly) You know, I was young once, too. I never would've thought of doing something like that. - Good grief, it's Daddy! (plate shatters) - Now who else is here? - Nobody. Besides, you're not allowed upstairs. - Why is that? - Because Grandma said so, and she meant it. - Well, I'm going out to my car and wait for reinforcements. Now, you girls better be good. - I wonder where Joella is. - Joella. - Let's go find out. - What's the matter? - Daddy's downstairs! (comical music) See, you're wrong, Henry. This is a Corinthian column, and that's an Ionic. - Yeah, okay, you're right. She's so smart. That's what she was doing in the library. - [Bonnie] And I always wondered. - Well, now you know. - Well, I'm certainly relieved. - [Joella] Why? - Well, we didn't see you around and none of the guys. - We got a little suspicious. - I told you, I turned over a new leaf. - We were discussing Greek architecture. - Yeah, well, if it was anybody but Henry. (tires screech) - Oh my God. The police. - Hey, you, hey, you! Wait a minute, get out of that car, punk. You thought you'd try it again, huh? - Try what again? - Don't get wise with me. You're going to jail, smart ass. - I didn't do nothing, I just got here. - And another thing, what are you doing running around like that? You some kind of fruit or something? - Oh, please, please, let me go home. - Home? Jail will be your home! - So how come you were sitting in the kitchen with the lights out? - What are you getting at, Ken? - You're taking my girl. Damn it, I thought so. (Kenny screams) (Kenny groans) - What's the matter? (Kenny shouts) What are you doing? - I'm drunk! - Well, aren't we all? Come on, let's go inside. - No. I'm real comfortable here. - Suit yourself. (TV chatters) - Hi, Pete. - Hi. - Where's Kenny? - [Pete] He's outside on the lawn. - Is he hurt? - No, just drunk. - Oh. I think I'll go get a drink. (romantic music) - I thought she would never leave. - All ducks on deck. Okay. (Joella hums) (light music) - Ow! Pontiac! (lively rock music) - [George] Hey, big Ken, come on outta there. Pete wants to talk to you. - Leave me alone, I got work to do. - Hey, I know how to get him out. (beer fizzes) - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Hey! Hey! You're always pissing on me! What the hell's the matter with you, anyway? - You know what you are? You're a pain in the ass. - Me? I didn't ask you here. Why don't you just buzz off. - I'll leave when I'm ready to leave. - Well, get ready, 'cause you leaving. (boys grunt) (lively rock music) (Pete laughs) (Kenny laughs) (George laughs) - What are you guys doing? Come on, guys, can't you take a little kidding? (George screams) (Kenny laughs) - Oh, shit, it's almost noon. - Why, what's happening at noon? - Nothing, I just gotta go. (lively rock music) (George whimpers) (romantic music) - [George] Who are you? - Hi, I'm Candy. I just moved here from Fairfield. - Fairfield? - And Kenny was nice enough to ask me to go to the lake. He was the first cute guy I met. - Well, it pays to shop around. - I'll say. What's your name? - George. - (sighs) That's nice. And yours? - Pete. (bluesy music) - Hey, why don't you come to the lake with us? - I don't think that would be such a good idea. (bluesy music) - Well, maybe some other time. - Yeah, maybe. - Well, I'm sorry, but we can't stay. We're in a big hurry. - Why? - Important business. See you guys later.
