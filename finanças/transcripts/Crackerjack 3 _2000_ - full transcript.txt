(dramatic music) - So, you been doing this long? - Moving the big bombs around? - Yeah. - Ever since we won the war. - The Gulf War? - The Cold War you idiot. - I never heard of that one. - Well, most have been before your time. How old are you anyway, son? 12? - 19 next Wednesday. - Jesus wept. They're sending these babies as backup. (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Agents in position. - Roger that, Command One. - Huh? - Oh, Command One. New band. Not your style. (dramatic music) So, you ever have any problems on these trucks? - Nah, take a landmine to stop this baby. - That's what we figured. (dramatic music) (explosion booming) - [Soldier] Red alert you're surrounded. - God. - Coming right up. (gun firing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - [Man] Come on. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) Two men over here. (dramatic music) (bright music) - Did you pack my personal stuff yet? - Most of it's already in the car. - Excellent. What about my tickets? - All taken care of. - I don't know what I would've done without you. - Gotten fired. - Probably. Bit late for that now though. I like being retired. Kel, did I ever tell you that you're one hell of an assistant? - Assistant, huh? Best intelligence analyst you'll ever see. (hand knocking) - Come in. - Hi, Jack. I'm glad I caught you. I thought you might be gone already. Just wanted to wish you a fond farewell. - I bet you did. I'll be out of here before you know it. - No, take your time. Just came to give Kelly her schedule for the economy conference. Korea? Infantry? - No. Vietnam. Navy Seals. - Well. Anything before the Gulf War is ancient history, Jack. The world has changed. May I? - Sure, help yourself. - Thank you. You know that nine out of 10 kids couldn't even show you Vietnam on the map and Korea is a place that can't even afford to make knockoff Nike's anymore. It's time to step down. Smell the roses. Go fishing, Jack. - And that's exactly what I intend to do. Go fishing. So it's an out with the old, in with the new kind of thing is it? - Yeah, something like that. See, no more of this organization of governments and training counter revolutionaries in lost causes. We are the new wave. - And exactly what kind of wave is that? - It's money management, Jack. You know the kind of thing that you could never figure out. (soft music) Nationalism is out. Colorization is in. Goodbye. - We'll see you, Marcus. Absolutely amazing. - I can't believe they sent us a Canadian money manager to run this place. - That man is a very interesting combination of the human failure. Has he given you your new assignment yet? - He assigned me to the G7 economic conference in Germany. Data analysis. Boring. - Well it might be boring, but at least you get to do some traveling. - He's phasing out covert action altogether. He calls it corporate downsizing. He says he can get more intelligence from the stock market than he can from 100 guys like you. Not to mention the fact that he doesn't trust me. Thinks I've been infected by working with you for too long. - Have you been infected? - I've got a serious case of the Jack Thorn virus. I may never get over it. - You know, it's been an interesting day for me. Clay calls me a dinosaur and you tell me that I have an infectious disease. - So take two aspirin and you can call me in the morning. - What's this? - It's the latest in cell phone technology. - Oh my god. You know, I couldn't figure out how to work this thing in a million years. I appreciate the thought. Thank you. - Well, it comes with an instruction book. - I certainly hope so. (phone ringing) Now that phone I know how to work. (phone ringing) Jack Thorn. - Jack. Is that you, Jack? - Pierre, you old frog. I thought you had died already. Are you still tracking down Algerian terrorists? Are you okay? - I'm well (speaks in foreign language). A little tired from my workout perhaps. - What are you doing up in the middle of the night? It must be like midnight in Paris. - I thought I would call and congratulate you on your retirement. I've never regretted my own. Believe me (speaks in foreign language). Plenty of time for the finer things in life. - Oh. And what color hair does your latest finer thing have? - Put it back in the safe for me, would you? - [Woman] Sure. - You are a wicked man for thinking such a thing, Jack Thorn. Enjoy your new freedom, old friend. Treasure every moment as though it was going to be your last. Just as I do. (speaks in foreign language) Jack. (speaking in foreign language) (bright music) (speaking in foreign language) - Next week. - Of course. - Nice man. Terrible cook. (bright music) (speaking in foreign language) (bright music) (explosion booming) (sirens wailing) - We've got a problem. - What kind of problem? - You don't work here anymore. - That might be but he still has clearance. What's the problem? - Well someone hijack an X47J2P. Been shipped to the Richmond arsenal in Virginia. - An X what? - A neutron bomb. Tactical. - Wow. When? - Eight, maybe 10 hours ago. They missed two check ins. We found them 10 minutes ago. - Any survivors, witnesses? - Those convoys are supposed to take the back roads, so no one saw anything. - Okay, here's what we're going to do. Organize a command post. Contact the Pentagon. - Go fishing, Jack. We don't need you here. - [Kelly] He just wants to help. - Well he can help if he can get the hell out of here, so we can finish our job. - No one hijacks a neutron bomb without help from the inside. So start your investigation closer to home. - [Kelly] I'll remember that. - I think we can do without your input, Jack. (soft music) I'm the one running this section. Not you. - Marcus. This is not an issue of your ego. This is a matter of national security. - And it's for me to handle it, not you. (soft music) - [Jack] Maybe. - What's that supposed to mean? - Maybe I'll do a little bit of investigating on my own. - While you do that, I would get you arrested before you can cash your first pension check. - Oh boy. - He's right, Jack. Just leave it to us. - How 'bout you listen to her? She's giving you good advice. Safe advice. - Take care. Keep in touch, huh. - I'll do just that. I'll see you, Kelly. * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living the life of ease * 'Cause me and my boat and the fish on pole * - Hey fish. Here I come. * The sun is up and the birds are singing * * I feel a gentle breeze * 'Cause I've got all the time in the world * * To do whatever I please - Yeah. Okay, thanks. Lapin is dead. His girlfriend just called. Someone blew him to pieces. - Jack was just talking to him yesterday. - Is that so? Quite a coincidence if I believe in coincidences. - What's that supposed to mean? - There is no record of Jack's whereabouts during the time when the weapon was hijacked, and I checked the logs and it says personal day. - You don't believe Jack was involved, do you? - I just believe in facts, Miss Jones, and Jack said it himself you should start the investigation close to home. - Are you trying to tell me that Jack is a trader? - I thought you might be interested in a piece of news. One of the bodies we found at the hijack site was Simon Bartlett. The name ring a bell? - He was a friend of Jack's. Went into private security after he took early retirement from MI5. - A north wig is found at the hijack site five minutes after Jack talked to another old friend. The man is blown to pieces. And today the French Intelligence calls to tell me that they found the minutes of a meeting in Lapin safe concerning the hijacking. Come on, Kelly. This is MI5. KGB. East Germans Nazi. The Mossad and even the Cubans. And now Jack. (soft music) No coincidence anymore. I'm telling you Jack is involved. - I don't believe it and why all the bodies? - I don't know. Cold War score's been settled. Who knows? Whatever the case it would appear that Jack was trying to pad his pension with a little larceny while angling to sell the bomb to the highest bidder. Who knows? - That's crazy. - You know it is crazy to think he could get away with it. (soft music) Now, where is he? (soft music) - Vermont. I don't know the exact location. - Vermont. I'll find him. (bright music) - No. (bright music) Yes. * There ain't gonna be no worries * - It's my first one today. * Just me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please * The sun is up and the birds are singing * * I feel a gentle breeze * 'Cause I've got all the time in the world * * To do whatever I please * Ain't nobody bugging me * I ain't got no bills to pay * There ain't nothing else I have to do * * But hey, I got all day * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living a life of ease * Just me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please (phone ringing) - [Woman] You have not entered the number properly. Please hang up and dial again. (bright music) - How can I dial? There is no dial. (bright music) - Come on, Jack. - [Woman] If you would like to send a fax, press the pound key. If you would like to send email, press the star key. If you would like to consult our online directory, press the star and pound keys together. (bright music) * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living a life of ease * Just me and my boat and a fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please - [Woman] The telephone customer you are trying to reach is presently unavailable. - Damn. * Doing whatever I please - Evening, sir. - Thorn could be a problem, Griswald. - [Griswald] Yes, sir. - Solve it for me. - [Griswald] Of course, sir. (soft music) - [Kelly] Good thing I found you before Clay did. (soft music) - [Marcus] Hans? - [Hans] Yeah. - [Marcus] Sergei. - [Sergei] Yeah. - [Marcus] Percival. - [Percival] As requested. - [Marcus] Maurice. - [Maurice] Me. - [Marcus] Good, so we are all here. Well, I'm happy to report that we have achieved our predicted goals with respect to the situation we discussed at our previous meeting. - I take it there will be no disruption to ark of the plan and our receivables will remain integral. - There might be some last minute adjustments in terms of the optimal person terminations of the senior element but nothing we can't handle. - You have reached a provisional assessment presumably. - [Marcus] Yes, we have. Flow indicators gave us a yes no equation in the area of 93% in our favor. We quantify the device parameters. It will shift deniability to the retro grouping of senior personnel as we agreed. Growth rates are promising. - Clay, can you be a little more specific? - When the bomb goes off, the market will fall. - Yeah. - [Marcus] If we sell short on all currencies immediately beforehand, then that fiscal position should be showing positive with no exposure to us at all. - So, this means we get to keep our job, yes? - Yes, but mostly it means that we get rich and the old guys get the blame. - And Thorn? - He's as good as dead. (bright music) - Here fishy, fishy, fishy. Here fishy. (bright music) Here fishy, fishy. (gun firing) (dramatic music) - You're slipping, Jack. - Really? (man groaning) (dramatic music) - What are you thinking? - Huh? - What are you thinking about? - Oh. Pierre Lapin and Simon Bartlett. It doesn't make any sense that someone would have them murdered. They were retired. Out of the game. Just like me. - Well, Clay's making a case that it all ties in with the theft of the X47 neutron bomb with you as the mastermind. - Me? - Look, there's some evidence from Lapin's safe that you and half the people you ever worked with or against are part of the conspiracy. Presumably you and your friends have had some kind of falling out and you're now killing each other off. - Well we know that's bullshit. I wonder what the hell Clay is up to. - Ask him. - I think I will. But first I'm gonna call in a couple of favors. (bright music) - [Operator] Operator. - Patch me through to Miami. (bright music) (dramatic music) - Honey, I'm home. (bright music) Ambush by a bunch of retired old farts. I'm ashamed of myself. - [Kurt] Stand down. - It's time for your pill, old kraut. - Hey, gained a bit of weight I see, Ricky. - Watch yourself, Benny. - I thought everyone in Cuba was a Fidel giant these days. - Eh? No food yesterday. No food tomorrow. No food today. Used to be called the Moscow diet. - It's good to see you. - See much of your grandchildren, Ricky? - Well as much as I like. They keep stealing my boat and try to take it to Key West and I keep bringing them back. I tell them wait. Fidel won't live forever but they're not patient. - The same with mine. No patience. - For my friends. From Fidel's private supply. Rolled on the thighs of young virgins. Politically incorrect. I know. - Oh. - Jack. - Good to see you again. - It's good to see you, my friend. - It's been awhile. - Sooner than more often. - So. We need to talk. About him. (bright music) - Who is he? One of ours? - No. One of ours. (bright music) - [Yuri] What exactly is going on, Jack? At a time it is one thing but this is ridiculous. Lapin, Bartlett. They're swatting us like ants. - [Benny] Flies, Yuri. - [Yuri] Flies. I do not like the thought of ending up as a bug on the bottom of someone's shoe. This friend of yours, Jack. You say she's on our side? - You bet she is. - [Ricky] Where? - She's at Langley keeping an eye on things. - According to her, Clay and his friends are setting you up as a mastermind but a mastermind of what? - I don't know. Maybe it's time to play truth or consequences. Did that hurt? Aw. That's nothing compared to the pain you're gonna feel unless you tell me everything I wanna know about what your boss is up to. - Screw you, Thorn. - Really? Boys. - I took a course in this. You're not gonna get anything out of me. - Excellent. - He's resisting. - You were raised old fashioned that way. It's the KGB training. Give him a rubber hose, some brass knuckles, and he's a happy, little commissar. - Hold off, boys. Maybe I should talk to him. Make him understand. Give him a chance. - What is this, one of your stupid American talk shows? You don't chat with people like this. You use pliers on them. - You can't torture me. This is the United States of America. We have a Bill of Rights. - You also have Home Depot. They got good pliers there, Yuri. Very cheap. - Griswald. I would listen to my friends if I were you. They mean business and they did not sign the amnesty international agreement. - You can't do this to me anyway, Thorn. - [James] Is that right? - No civilized nation can condone an act of violence against its own citizen by agents from a foreign power. - Is that so, Jack? - Yes. Especially bodily harm. So excruciatingly painful physically as well as mentally as to render the subject into a. Give me a word here. - [Yuri] Turnip. - Good. - Imbecile. - Very good. - [Kurt] Babbling idiot. - That too. - Guacamole. - Excellent. All of that. - Screw you, Thorn. - No. Screw you, Griswald. You can have him, boys. I'm going fishing. - It's night, Jack. - So? I'll go night fishing. - Thorn, you can't just leave me here with these idiots. - Is that right? Watch me. - Thorn. - Spill the beans now and save yourself a ride on von Brunner's chemical rollercoaster. And with those East Germans Nazi types, you never know where the needle's been. - Sodium betanaphthol? - Arginine and nitric acid. It will set his veins on fire and give him such hallucinations that they'll make him think he has got a million scorpions under his skin. - I can take anything you guys can dish out. - I've got some very nice scopolamine from a Mossad pharmacy. Turn you into a parrot in about 30 seconds. - To hell with you nursing home scumbags. - That was a poor choice of words, Mr. Griswald. I got a cure for a shit mouth like you. - One of ours? - A Bulgarian knockoff. - Chemistry. Boy scouts stuff. - I didn't know you were a boy scout. - Well, young pioneer actually. The Lenin batch. - Senior Lenin batch. - I thought you only got to senior Lenin batch if you turned in your parents. - I did no such thing. - No? - As usual you got your facts wrong. - Oh yes. You didn't turn in your parents. You turned in your wife's parents. And then he turned in his wife (laughs). - Get on with it. So, who goes first? - After you. - Maybe it should be, Ricky. Let the ugly one go first. - In your dreams, Benny. - I'll sue. - I know what. We are in the United States of America, aren't we? A democracy. - So? - Why don't we do it together? All for one. - [All] One for all. - No. - I just had confirmation, people. It seem that we have a weak link in our little chain. Someone who has forgotten where his or her allegiance lies. Someone who is playing with my patience. Someone who illegally used $852.53 worth of her own shrinking budget to use the satellite up link for his or her own purposes. To scan for a location. A location in Vermont. You would not know anything about that, would you, Kelly? - Of course. I'm an intelligence analyst, remember? I looked for Jack Thorn. You are looking for him, aren't you? I did the right thing, didn't I, Mr. Clay? - Should have asked first. - I'll remember that next time. If you'll excuse me, I have to take some files down to the archives. (soft music) - I want her watched 24 seven. Please, someone find Griswald. (soft music) - But it wasn't my fault. She loved me. She loved me. She loved me like I was her own son, but I wasn't her son. I didn't even know her. I didn't even know her. I didn't wanna know her. - This isn't getting us anywhere. - But I went to the doctor and the doctor told me that I was okay so I decided to just join up and everybody said that would be great. - It's time to end this foolishness. - We can't kill him yet, Yuri. - Chemistry. Waste of time. - You have a better idea? - You're betting your life. - Don't. Okay. Mom. (bright music) - Time to make a few phone calls, huh. (bright music) Dial 1-800. I talk fast. (bright music) - [Griswald] All the love that I ever had was found in the valley. - Where you going to attach them to, huh Yuri? - Can I go home now? (bright music) - Kind of crude, don't you think? (gentle music) (man screaming) (gentle music) - [Woman] These are the initial satellite images we picked up. (dramatic music) We put a GPS transponder on her vehicle just as you requested. (dramatic music) The plate is hers. We checked. (dramatic music) - Is she still in the building? - [Woman] Yes, I think so. - Good. Good, that will give you a lot of time to get everything in place. Bug everything. I want to hear that bitch brushing her teeth at night. Don't forget her cell phone. - [Woman] Yes, sir. (dramatic music) - Hook, line, and sinker, Mr. Thorn. Hook, line, and sinker. - So, now we know. Thanks to me. - Clay and his people are gonna blow up this international money conference with the neutron bomb we stole. - And we are going to catch the blame. - We need to do something about that. - [Ricky] We need a plan. - Plan? Plan to do what? We're just a bunch of old men. - Speak for yourself. - We can argue about this as much as we like, but no one's gonna help us. All we have is us. - Clay and his pals set this up to look as if we hijacked the bomb. I say we prove him right. - How? - Well, we just do it. That's all. We know where they're taking it. - Just how are we going to get there, huh? - We'll fly Air Fidel. I'm the Minister of Trade. - What this got to do with trade? (soft music) - Sometimes we do our trading between Bogota and Miami. They're very loyal to us. - Oh you don't get too high. (bright music) - I never knew you could fly a plane so close to the water. - Keeps us under the radar. Easier to see where you're going, too, compadre. (bright music) - See this low plane has its disadvantages, too. - Columbian air conditioning. (bright music) - [Yuri] What you reading, Jack? - How to place an international phone call. - Calling? - Kelly. (bright music) - Hey, you aren't supposed to use cell phones on planes. You screw up sensitive instrument. - What sensitive instrument? What this crate? Get out of here. - Hey. You hurt me, Jack. Old as crate. (bright music) (alarm ringing) The Santa Maria. - Is there a problem? - We're running low on fuel. - What? - We're running low on fuel. It's okay. I got extra. Put 120 on that side. 180 on that side. (bright music) - When are we going to get there? - Sometime late tonight or early tomorrow morning. Or maybe tomorrow afternoon. (bright music) (phone ringing) - It's ringing. (phone ringing) These gadgets aren't bad. (phone ringing) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) Kelly? - Jack. What's all that noise? - Oh. It's the stewardess. Listen, Griswald cracked. We're on our way to Germany. Where are you? - Already there. - What about our package? - Hang on for a second. (soft music) Me again. It was nothing. Coming in at the old NATO airstrip in the Koenigsmacker forest. - Koenigsmacker. Sounds like a breakfast cereal. - Midnight tomorrow. - Midnight it is. You take care of yourself, okay. - You're the one who should be taking care, Jack. Clay's getting even more suspicious now that Griswald seems to have fallen out of the loop. Bye. Good luck, Jack. - Whatever did happen to Griswald? - He was talking about fulfilling lifelong ambition to join the Bolshoi. - Join the Bolshoi? (energetic music) (bright music) (speaking in foreign language) (bright music) - Grandkids? - Sometimes I bring them over from my sister next door. - Tell me something. You don't actually manage to sell these, do you? - You'd be surprised. I just sent a shipment to Algeria. - To the desert? - Oh, I sell it to anyone who needs a gnome to drag out the dollar. - Even okay with noises. Marta. I think it is time the children were going. - Oh children, it's time to leave now. (bright music) Come on, come on. (bright music) - Nice kid. (bright music) - Wow, von Brunner. You always keep this much ordinance around? - For protection only. - In case somebody wants to steal the seven dwarfs. - Gifts from France when I retired to remember them by. - Had I known we were playing the dirty dozen, I bring my own stuff. This is garbage. - Yeah, things haven't been the same since the war came down. - Well I tell you I don't mind this old stuff. It's reliable. I could never get used to this modern laser aim fire and forget stuff. With my luck, I'd be facing someone somewhere and my battery would be dead. - Lead is lead no matter what kind of gun it comes from. - Katchkov, careful not to shoot the merchandise. - Very profound, Yuri. Is that Marx or Mayo? - Bonnie and Clyde. - Just don't shoot at my gnomes. They're very fragile. - Hey Jack, by stealing this thing, aren't we just digging ourselves deeper? - We don't have a choice. Clay has set the whole intelligence community against us. Our pensions are at stake. We gotta stop him and stealing the bomb is the only way to do it. - But Clay and his people have covered all the bases. - He has his weaknesses. - I'm not seeing much evidence of this. - Clay has all the wisdom and pride of youth. - Which means he has very little wisdom, Jack. - And pride goeth before the fall. (bright music) - [Soldier] Looks like we blew a gasket. - [Man] Oh damn. (bright music) - You're needing help perhaps? (soft music) - Not from a pair of old geezers like you. - Did he say geezers? - He said geezers. - [Benny] No, really? - Really. - Don't say I didn't warn you. (gun firing) - Lousy shot. - Military training has gone to hell these days. - You want geezers, I'll give you geezers. Catch. (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Hold on. - What? - Move back. (guns firing) (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Let's go. Let's get out of here. - They're running away. Caught you. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic music) - Turkey shits. - Chicken, Yuri, chicken. - Eh. Ducks, gooses, chickens. They're still cowards no matter what sort of birds they are. (bright music) - We risked our life for a bunch of balloons. - Geez. (dramatic music) - Blanks. - I think we've been had. (gentle music) - Well, a little bit of editing and this will be perfect at the congressional hearings. Nice shot of Jack and his fellow conspirators. Don't you think so, Miss Jones? (soft music) - I used to think you were just an overdressed, pompous ass. Now I know you're crazy, too. - Really? You know, treachery is a matter of record. - [Kelly Voiceover] Coming in at the old NATO airstrip in the Koenigsmacker forest. Clay's getting even more suspicious now that Griswald seems to have fallen out of the loop. - Now, who's the crazy one, Miss Jones? You see you left a trail a mile wide incriminating yourself. - [Kelly] You'll never get away with it. (soft music) - I already have. That's a fact of life. - Maybe. Sometimes the old fights back. (soft music) - And loses. - Not too much excitement my doctor says. Lower your stress levels he says. What does he know? I feel young again. - The Israeli's been taking Ricky's tree frog drug. Tonight was a disaster. (bright music) - You actually enjoy the thing? - It could've been a lot worse. - People are trying to kill us. They'll probably try again. (bright music) - We walked into a trap and hijacked of balloons, Jack. What could be worse? - We could've been killed. - He has a point. - You see me take out the truck, Ricky? - I saw. You did good, Benny. But they really weren't fighting back. - Maybe my reputation preceded me. Two gun Goldman. (gentle music) - Well, let's just hope it doesn't happen this evening 'cause I'm tired. Oh shit. (explosion booming) (bright music) - [Man] Move it. (guns firing) (bright music) - Stay down. (guns firing) (bright music) - [Man] Watch out. All in position. - They can see in the dark. - [Man] Peters, I need ya. - [Peters] 10 four, 10 four. (gun firing) At checkpoint, sir. - They can hear us, too. (guns firing) (bright music) - [Man] Roger that. I got 'em, I got 'em. (guns firing) (bright music) - We'll never make it. (gun firing) - Got weapons. We fight our way out of here or die trying. - Stop quoting Stalin. - [Man] This on a take train. - [Soldier] Yes, sir. - Stalin taught scared. - There got to be a better way than dying a hero. - You wanna smoke them out with your cigars? (guns firing) (bright music) - What are you gonna do talk them to death, Jack? (bright music) Huh? - Something like that. (bright music) - [Soldier] We're holding, sir. Can't quite make it out. - Who you gonna call? - Everybody. (guns firing) (bright music) (bright music) - [Woman] Call me at 555. - [Man] What is this? - [Woman] SEXX. - [Soldier] Yo Thompson, you seeing what I'm seeing? - [Woman] Give me a call. I'm waiting for you. - [Man] How'd that get on there? - Yes. - [Man] What's going on? - [Woman] Call me at 555-SEXX. Go on give me a call. - [Man] Come on, guys, focus. - Yes. - [Soldier] You might have a job, gentlemen. - [Man] Get that thing fixed. Go to manual. (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Come on. Let's go. (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Take this. (dramatic music) (explosion booming) - Way to go. - [Man] Let's go, let's go. (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Everyone okay? - [Yuri] Jack. - Yuri. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (explosion booming) - My god. - That's a hell of a handgun you've got there, Brit. - What I really need now is a nap. - Little dog needs a little sleep, huh. (gentle music) (bright music) - Rick. (bright music) - It's an email for you. - For me? It's from Clay. Clay has taken Kelly and he's keeping her at the old US army base at Braunschweiger. - That's right next to the Chateau where they're holding the G7 conference. - Unless I give myself up, he's gonna kill her. - That's it. Game over. - I've gotta do what he says. - No. It's a trap. You'll be committing suicide. - I have to agree with Yuri. He's right this time. You'll be throwing your life away, amigo. - I am not going to abandon her. - This man Clay has been one step ahead of us from the beginning. He still is. We've ran out of options. - No. I spent my whole life fighting for causes that I believe in. We all have. Do we throw this away for a gang of (speaks in foreign language) like Clay and his people? - No, we don't. I agree with Rick. It's not over until the fat lady sings and there's always light at the end of the tunnel. The question is which tunnel do we go down? Do we rescue Kelly or do we go after the neutron device? If Braunschweiger is anything like any other military base it's gonna be riddled with ducks and vents and there's got to be a way to get inside. - You get the girl. - And we get the bomb and stop it from going off. Jack. How do you stop a neutron bomb from going off? - I can't even get my VCR to work, so how do you expect me to disarm a neutron bomb? - Is this an X47 series neutron bomb or a Y79? - Oh, it's an X47. - That's the one with the dutra radon lithium six. Try tying the iridium driver. (bright music) - Oh. Well. If you say so. - The core normally gets compressed to hyper densities of around 10,000 times the norm. That generates about a kiloton of energy. (bright music) Enough to fry anything organic in a small city. To stop it, all you need to do is preempt iridium driver by exploding the shell of the bomb prematurely. - Okay. How would we do that? - Simple. Use a high quality plastic explosive like Semtex. - This Semtex, you learn about that from your Uncle Kurt? - No, picked it up on the web. - And the neutron bomb? You learn about that on the web, too? - No. - Where then? - "Men in Black". (upbeat music) - "Men in Black". (upbeat music) - Whoa. I don't suppose he knows where we can buy a truckload of Semtex. (upbeat music) - The Semtex will not be a problem. - [Marta] Ah children, it's time for supper. Come on. (upbeat music) - As you know, Semtex is the most popular terrorist explosive in the world. While the Czechs best efforts along with the scorpion machine pistol and the vorgelesen burner. You can mold it into any shape you want. Hit it with hammer. Throw it on the floor. Even set it on fire. - Yes, well I don't see any. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (explosion booming) - Oh yeah. - [Kurt] You just wasn't looking in the right places. - Algeria? Now I get it. Let me guess about who the other places, okay. Bosnia, Czechia, Libya, Bulgaria. Anything ending in ia. - A few dry lands as well. Very planned gardens in Belfast. - Chateau Braunschweiger. Your standard black forest lunatic prince's summer house. A NATO conference center until they tore down the wall. Nice and isolated. This is the base. - Okay. Getting in is one thing. What about getting out? - All these old places have secret tunnels. We'll find something. - So that's it. You two find the bomb and you two bring in the gnomes. (bright music) - [Man] What's this? - Gnomes for your garden, yes. - Gnomes? (speaking in foreign language) (bright music) - Snow White. (speaking in foreign language) - Gnome, yeah. (speaking in foreign language) Gnome. All right. (bright music) - [Ricky] Gnomes. (bright music) - Did you have to hit him so hard? - Go. (bright music) - I should've used a pillow? Besides, he was in the way. (bright music) (dramatic music) - Arthritis acting up, Yuri? (dramatic music) Brains meet raw. (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Was this the storage? (speaking in foreign language) Yeah, okay. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - My god. If only I had this before the war came down. Wow. - Tempting, isn't it? (gentle music) - Cold War is over, comrade. We both lost. - Hey, compadre. - [Yuri] Just take a look at this thing. (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) (dramatic music) - Brings back memories, huh? If only we had one of these during the missile crisis. - [Benny] Just be glad Khorodkovsky never got his hands on one. - He almost did. We sent him a knockoff. It blew up on the ship. - Freeze. (dramatic music) - You left a trail a mile wide. Reinforcements? You'll have to do better than ugly garden ornaments I'm afraid. - Take one home to your wife and tell her it's self portrait. - Why don't you just kill us now and have done with it? - Why waste bullets when we've got a neutron bomb? Take their weapons. (dramatic music) - [Guard] You heard him. Hand 'em over slowly. (dramatic music) - [Jack] Kelly. - Jack. (dramatic music) - Good to see you. - You too. (dramatic music) - You didn't have to go through all that, Thorn. All you had to do is knock politely and come in the front door. Now was it silly of me to think that you'd do something as crazy as that? - You're the crazy one, Clay. - Well Miss Jones said exactly the same thing. Now, what's that old cliche? Great minds think alike and fools seldom differ. And I think you and your friends are falling into the second category. - Really? What about you? Only a fool would blow up an economic conference. - I'm not the one that's gonna blow it up. Your friends will. And I have the evidence to prove it. - I see. So we take the blame? - Precisely. Who controls the international retirement fund? - [Jack] The United States does. Why? - With American dollars. Now take that away and America's power, position and prestige, it's finished. See the G7 heads have agreed to ban currency trading and they are going to sign a treaty to that effect. The Cold War may be over but the cash war has just begun. - You don't care how many people you kill as long as you get what you want. - Which reminds me I should check to see that the delegates are getting here on time. You know what? I'll be back so we can watch the festivities together. See this door? Three inches thick. And the electronic lock has 5.3 million combinations. Oh by the way, don't expect any help from your friends. I took care of that little detail. (soft music) - You okay? - Yeah. (soft music) Man. He's outsmarted us at every corner. - Maybe. Or maybe this old dog can still learn some new tricks. - You're not old. - No, but I am technology challenged. (dramatic music) - Well I hope all of you are comfortable. Any requests? (dramatic music) - Kelly. Do you know what a duo tangent oscillating transponder is? - Sure. Every military computer system has one. - Really? Do you think you can find one here? - Yeah, I can try. - [Jack] Go for it. (dramatic music) - A cigarette. What about a cigar? - It's bad for your health. (dramatic music) - What about you? Blindfold? - Blindfold? You mean so I don't have to look at the face of a putz like you. - Such valor in the face of disaster. (dramatic music) It's too bad it's wasted, Mr. Goldman. (dramatic music) Everything in order? - Right on schedule. (dramatic music) - Good. (dramatic music) (machine beeping) It was a pleasure, gentlemen. (speaking in foreign language) - [Yuri] Duck fucker. - Mother, Yuri. It's mother. (dramatic music) - You see that thing in there? That's a 10 mile blast effect. We better get going. - There's almost 100 civilians still in the building. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - One more won't make a difference. (dramatic music) - Got it. - You're kidding? - [Kelly] Now what? - All right. Now we pray. (dramatic music) I'm accessing the cell phones random number generator and if I can get the first three numbers right, the rest is easy. (phone ringing) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) See what you can learn by reading an instruction manual? After you. (dramatic music) - [Ricky] Left hand. I said left hand. - [Benny] Your left or my left? - [Ricky] What? - [Benny] My pocket. My Swiss army knife. - [Jack] Well, well, look at you. - Hey Jack. We got everything under control. - Sure you do. (bright music) We don't have much time. - Always so upbeat. (bright music) - [Jack] You know what to do. Do it. I'm going after Clay. - Good luck. - Be careful. (dramatic music) - We've got a bomb threat. - [Man] Everyone out. - Clear the building. Hold back the delegates. Let's go. (bright music) - [Guard] Which one of you wants to explain this? - [Men] She does. - You son of a bitch. You killed my friends. Admit it. - You damn right I did. - Basically that's a neutron bomb. - I planned it, the whole thing. - It's an X47 series neutron bomb. That's the one with the duo ray lithium six thread type. (bright music) - The iridium driver. (bright music) The core normally gets compressed to hyper densities of around 10,000 times the normal. - Tell me about Pierre Lapin. - It generates about kiloton of energy. - I set up. - Enough to fry anything organic in a small city. (bright music) - Do it. - Can you stop it? - All you need to do is preempt the iridium driver by exploding the shell of the bomb. - Premature. (bright music) - How do you do that? - Simple. Use high quality plastic explosives like Semtex. - What about Simon Bartlett? - Him too. - Okay, if that explains it well enough, I really think we should get going. - Are you sure this is gonna work? - Do you really wanna hang around and find out? - Shut that door, Jack Thorn, or we both die. Shut it. (bright music) - Come on, Jack. (bright music) Come on, Jack. (bright music) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (explosion booming) - It worked. (dramatic music) - Jack. - Compadre. - You Jack Thorn? - That's me. I've got Clay's confession on tape. - It might tie up a few loose ends, but it's not really necessary now. - Tie up a few loose ends? Not really necessary now? I busted my ass to get his confession on tape. - Like I said, not really necessary. Your friends here already got you off the hook with that note. - What note? (gentle music) Whose idea was it? - You always need a plan B, Jack. We stopped the bomb. And saved your (speaks in foreign language). - Not to mention the G7 delegates. - Oh and our reputations, too. - Pensions too maybe. - What I wanna know is who's gonna pay for my gnome? - Why don't you put it on Clay's expense account? (bright music) - Where exactly is Clay? - He's locked up in the basement just in case you had anymore loose ends you wanted to tie up. - And if you can't make the pig talk, give him to us. We'll make him squeal. (bright music) - I bet you will. Let's get out of here. (bright music) - [Benny] This justice system of the Americans is very flawed. First, they catch him. Then they can get anything out of him. After six month. - He had good lawyers. They couldn't even prove he had help. - That is the American way of course. This foolishness of innocent until proven guilty. - It works, Yuri. At least for football heroes and all burglars. - They think our methods are outdated. - Not everyone. After all, they did let him escape. - They did. - They did. - They did. (bright music) - Right into our own hands. (bright music) - No. * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living a life of ease * Just me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please * The sun is up and the birds are singing * * I feel a gentle breeze * 'Cause I've got all the time in the world * * To do whatever I please * Ain't nobody bugging me * I ain't got no bills to pay * There ain't nothing else I have to do * * But hey I got all day * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living a life of ease * Just me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please * There ain't gonna be no worries * * I'm living a life of ease * Just me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please * Me and my boat and my fish on pole * * Doing whatever I please (bright music) (energetic music)
