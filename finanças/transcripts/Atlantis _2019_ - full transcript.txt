ATLANTIS 2025, Eastern Ukraine. One year after the war. Are you ready ? - Yeah, let's shoot. - Let's. Three, eleven. - Ready ? - Ready ! - Time ? - Three, fifty-nine. Okay, let's do it separately. - Ready ? - Yes ! Four, eighteen. - Ready ? - Yes ! - Time ? - Three, twenty. - Awesome ! - Good job, Ivan. - So ? Let's make it harder. - Yes ! Let's go. From the center to the right, from the center to the left. Ready ? - Ready ? - Yes ! Hit it, you bitch, fucking hit it ! - Ready ? - Ready ! Task! First, third, seventh, fifth. Go random. Go, you motherfucker ! Shit ! No worries. Task. From the right to the center, from the left to the center. You start from the right. Are you fucking ready ? - Yes. - Damn it, are you ready ? Ready ? Go fucking hard, come on, you piece of shit. Holy fuck. Fuck ! Second, sixth, eighth target. - Random order. Got it ? - Got it. Go. - Fuck - Come on ! Shoot ! Piss off ! Are you fucking nuts ? - Are you ? - What ? - You can shoot me in my vest as well. - Easy-peasy. Cunt. Shell-shocked ! Fuck ! Damn it ! Fuck. Sit down, chill. Does it hurt ? It fucking does. Will you even go to work tomorrow ? I'm fed up with fucking work and the workers. They just walk around looking at me as if I was some kind of monster. Talk behind my back. I went to war and thought something might change. No fucking way. They are still die-hard Soviets. They want a tsar to come and solve all their problems. At first, I wanted to shoot them all, but then I realized I'd better disappear myself. Are you losing it again ? I'm so messed up, I don't remember when was the last time I slept. Pass me the jar. Shitty bullets again. They're regular bullets. - Hey man. - Hi there. I messed up last night. I'm sorry. Never mind. It's my fault. - How are you ? - Crappy, haven't slept again. Can't get myself together, I need to quit the factory, I'm going crazy. And go where ? Maybe go somewhere as contractors ? To shoot again, at least there's some point in it, unlike here. Aren't you shell-shocked enough ? More blood ? More death ? Fine, let's get back to work. What kind of work is that ? A lick and a promise ? I've worked here for forty years, haven't seen anything like that before. Good for nothing. Who welds like that ? You used to weld like a man ! Do it over again ! And don't spare the electrodes, the seam should be thick. I'll come back to check on you. You, your fathers and your grandfathers worked long and hard to produce this living for your families. You produced quality steel, that was sold across the world. You delivered the old Ukraine. But the times are changing. Everything has a beginning and an end. Today, is my sad task to tell you that this great works are gonna be closed for reconstruction. Yes, I understand your concern. But there's no choice. New times are upon us. New technologies make the old way redundant. These new technologies provide new opportunities. And together, we propose to work for a new future. A competitive Ukraine, a bright Ukraine. So let's just not glorify the past Yes, there was the heroic spirit of the past. Let's harness the new technologies. Let's celebrate the new future together. So, thank you. Let's drink ! Reconstruction ? What new technologies ? They'll just shut it down ! They will... - You're right. - No one will invest into this. In the US, they don't close their plants, you know. They are just eliminating the competition, whatever they say, it could still be profitable. You see ? It could be. We just have to stop stealing. Metal is exported, and brings foreign currency to the budget. And we have to pay off the debts which are higher than GDP. Can you imagine what this could lead to ? Our grandchildren won't be able to pay off these debts. In two years it will be a desert here. Did they pump out the water from the mines ? No, they didn't ! The water in the river is already salty. You can't drink it anymore. I suggest we go to Crimea. I'll go there myself, the bridge there has collapsed, they've got a lot of work to do. And what ? You'll take it apart and sell the metal ? Nineteen kilometers of bridge ! It's all because of your friend, shell-shock. Are you happy they're shutting down the plant ? Is this what you fought for ? Is that the reason you killed people ? How many lives have you got on your conscience ? He was fighting to protect you ! Me ? Did I ask you to protect me ? Was my life bad ? I had a job. Now I don't. Fucking bastards ! You work alternate weeks, here is your itinerary list and a pass should the patrol stop you. They put checks here and here on the border. Sign here. Safety training passed. And here to state your liability for the vehicle. You'd better get back by daylight, as there are almost no civilians in the zone, if the car breaks down, it will take a long time to get help. You'd better fix everything yourself, you have a tool box, and pour the remaining water into bottles. - Good luck. - Thanks. Good afternoon, have you got a pen ? Here you go. What we gonna do ? - Take care. - Thanks. Good afternoon ! You can't go any further, de-miners are working there now. You've got water ? Come again ? - There will be an explosion. - Roger. Let's step aside. So ? Have you found any ? We've covered about a hundred meters today, found about four AT mines, seems like the whole field used to be AT. I see, the Russians probably thought we'd be attacking them with tanks. Come on, pull over here. I'll take the can. - How does it work ? - I'll turn it on. Some mud. So, have you found only ATs or something better ? No, lots of ATs here, as you say, and we've found also POMZes, PMNs, fifties, nineties, and we try to destroy everything we can, here or elsewhere. It'll take 15-20 years, at least. I see. Did they leave a lot of PFMs here ? They did, the boys found about fifty in the woods and went on to destroy them. Can I go round somehow ? Yes, there's a road to the left, go there, we cleared it, make sure to go down it, don't digress, then you'll get to the highway and see for yourself where to go. - It's full. - Yep. - Okay, buddy, see you. - Take care. Good evening. I'm sorry to stop you, we're stuck, and have been here for three hours, we can't get out. - Hi, what's wrong ? - The engine is dead. - Where do you need to go ? - To the town. So, I'd have to pull you all the way ? - Do you have a rope ? - I do. Let me see, your vehicle is heavy, I hope it doesn't break. Great, hook it up to me, loop it over you, I'll pull, okay ? Let me get in the car with you, I'll show you the way. Okay. Call our guys, tell them we've set out. Okay. It's nice that you are warm in here because we've been standing like that for over three hours. No cars, we got awfully cold, and the vehicle has just been repaired, but it broke down again. In less than a week. No wonder, with the roads like this. Something's dripping over here. It's rattling so much. It's an old horse, but still going strong. Put it over here. - Hi. - Good evening. - We got tired of waiting for you. - We thought we'd never make it. This is for you, this is for us, your signature. Nina, Vitaliy, come here, we need to work. Hi. Hi. Help me. Grab his shoulder. Let's work. A body is delivered. The body's dressed in a green jacket, with a plastic zipper and plastic buttons, also green. The cloth is wet, the whole area is covered with grayish soil, there are numerous tears in the cloth of different shapes and sizes, black fleece sweater, with a zipper, two pockets, the pockets are empty, sweater material is wet, also covered with a layer of grayish soil. A T-shirt, wet, color is hard to detect, the front and the sides are severely damaged, the cloth of the T-shirt disintegrates during the examination, military type pants, dark and light green, a label on the left leg, MA-034. Snizhne 16.03 11:45. The cloth is wet, covered with dirt. Patch pockets on the sides button up with green buttons. The pockets are empty. Black underpants, wet material, dirty, not damaged, black boots, black laces, black soles, size 43. How long will it take ? I'm running late for the base. Just two more minutes. Just a little more. Socks in the boots, synthetic black, foot bones inside. After taking off the clothes, the corpse is of proper stature, male, in a state of advanced mortem changes in partial skeletonization and mummification. Oval head, skull is deformed on the left half of the brain, dark hair in the right frontal-lobe section. How long was he there in that state ? A year, maybe a year and a half. Depending on the conditions. A layer of soil on the front surface of the neck. The mouth is open, soil and... And six bullets, caliber seven sixty two, in his oral cavity, they are covered with soil, wet, dull. - He is a captive sniper. - Why do you think so ? The bullets, caliber fifty four, light with a steel plug, when the sniper was held captive, after intense interrogation, they would put bullets in his mouth one after another, make him swallow, and when he had a mouthful, they'd just finish him with a club and then bury him. Perhaps that's what happened. No injuries in the neck area. - Right hand is missing. - Anything else to photograph ? - No, that will do. - We'll be heading home then. - Fine, good bye. - Good bye. Right hand is missing, left arm and hand are missing. Joint surfaces are wet, the cartilaginous part is preserved, dense. Lift him up. Skin is missing at the back. Soft tissue is missing all the way from shoulder blades to pelvis, the bones are wet, dull, covered with mucus and mold. A skull fragment of rectangular shape came with the body, 12 by 9 cm, fine-tongued edges, dark brown on the inside surface, light yellow on the outside one. The external examination is over. We are moving on to the internal one and the injuries. Get ready, Vitalik. What a job you have, only dead bodies every day. Actually, not every day, sometimes it takes a month or more to find one. Aren't you tired of it ? What did you do before the war ? You won't believe it, I was doing a degree in archaeology, so I can say I'm following my profession. It's just that the events took place during our lifetime, and not thousands of years ago, it's like you are digging up your own history. And what brought you here, to the war ? I joined as a paramedic. It was almost the end of the war. We had a lot of injured, we took out only the ones who could make it, and now we have to go back for the ones we left behind. It must be hard. How do you get through it ? It's hard, but I'm trying to look at it another way. We let the dead say good bye to their relatives, finish their life story and their war. It's important. Are you at least getting paid for this ? Getting paid ? This is our own volunteer project, we are looking for funding. Basically, I work alternate weeks, you can count on me, if you need help. That would be great. Thank you. Found a body of an unidentified person, partially mummified, partially skeletonized.

Boys, come on. There is the registration number. - I see. - Signature here. This is the statement from the morgue. Signature here. Here. And here. - Is that it ? - Yes, the rest is for us. When's the next one ? We are waiting for the results, but no sooner than in a week. Let me tell you, forty seven sixty nine dash three hundred forty nine dash thirty one. - Okay. Later. - Good bye. Let's go, Sergiy. Good bye. Here is your itinerary list, it goes through the check point. They've filled up the vehicle with water, it will be here soon. - Good. - Take care. - Hello. - Hi. Do you remember me ? Yes, of course. How are you feeling ? - Better, thanks. - Good to hear. - Let's talk in the car. - Sure. Thank you for rescuing me that time. If it weren't for you, everything could have turned out really badly for me. Be more careful next time. There are a lot of mines still scattered around here. Not only mines. My organization deals with ecological monitoring in such dangerous zones. And I want to say that due to the war this territory became completely unsuitable for living. Everything will change, with time. Hundreds of flooded mines, destroyed factories ? They've polluted all the water. The changes are irreversible. Water can be delivered, distilled. Yes, it can, but it's not profitable. I think the only way out now is to leave this place. So many years of war, just to leave ? It took you ten years to clean this territory of the poison of Soviet propaganda and myths. But now you have to clean the water and soil. That will take decades, even hundreds of years. My stay here will end soon, but my organization operates in many countries. We always have vacancies. It's an opportunity for you to go abroad for a while, or start a new life in Europe. I can't answer right now. I understand that. These are my contacts. You have time to make a decision. Call me, when you do. I am very grateful. Okay. Thank you. What is it ? Something serious ? - Yes. - Can we make it on our own ? - Nope. - I see. Hello. Our engine is jammed. We need a tow car. Not far from the farm. About two kilometers from the bridge. Okay, we're waiting. Have you been living here for a long time ? Yeah, for a while, I like it here. It's quiet, no one bothers you. But that's not how it used to be ? No. I used to live like all ordinary people, and then everything suddenly ended. That's why you went to war ? Perhaps. At first I just wanted to die, then I witnessed one death, two, three, I nearly died myself. Then everything changed. I realized that I had to keep living. Why don't you leave here ? What's the point ? It will be harder to live among ordinary people. You can't trick yourself. You either take yourself as you are or you just disappear. I am fine with it. In fact, this is a real reservation for people like us. You might be right.
