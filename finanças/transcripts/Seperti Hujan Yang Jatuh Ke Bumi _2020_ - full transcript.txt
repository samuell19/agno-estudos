When we fall in love, we can do anything for the people we fall for. Pull it! Vin… We will still be working on the proposal today, right? I will send you the e-mail tonight. Just revise it later. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Vin, don't forget. Nara! Nara! Nara, watch out! Hey! Are you okay? You… Are you okay? I'm fine. Hey! Don't you know this place? Why did you ride a bicycle here? Don't you have eyes? What about you? Why don't you use them? -Hey… -Take it easy, Ned. She's just a girl. Chill out. You're lucky you're a girl. If your man wants a piece of me, I'm all in. So what if I'm a girl? -Nara-- -He's not my boyfriend! Let it go, man. -Hey! Don't run away! -It's all right. It's okay. Gosh… Is that my ice cream? Yes. I'm sorry, Vin. -It's okay. We can buy a new one. -Such a waste. -She is Nara. -Let's go. The first girl who made me understand what love is. I'll help. Come on, Niko! -Go, Niko! -Pass it, Van! Vin, I just don't get it. He's the smartest guy in class. How come he doesn't know that I like him? -Hi, Niko. -Hi, Nara. Well… His mind is only filled with basketball. A right triangle and a parallelogram. He can't think of another beauty. What? What do you mean? That means he lacks feelings, Nara. But still, we've talked before. He knows about dancing. He's so cool. So? So… After that, he never talked to me again. Each time, I tried to get close. He just went the other way. I know how it feels. To adore someone that never has a clue… What? What? -What did you say? -Nothing. It was just a movie quote. I forgot the title of the movie. That's odd. A movie quote. You used to quote Darwin or Einstein. My life is nothing without you, Vin. What? Who else would listen to my misery? Oh, okay. Take care. Nara! Nara! Wait up. Vin, you can go ahead. Niko will take me home. -Bye. -Bye. -Be careful. -Bye, Vin. Maybe God sent me just to be her best friend. THE MAN WHO SECRETLY FELL IN LOVE TARING EVENT PLANT TREE SEEDS ON WEDNESDAY TARING MEETING NEXT MONDAY GO TO BOOKSTORE WITH NARA What is it? Arman and I broke up. To be precise, he dumped me. Why? It's unclear. What's wrong with me? When I rarely called, he said I didn't care enough. When I called him all the time, he told me I was bossy. When I was nice to people, he said I'm a flirt. That's enough. Just forget him. A guy like him doesn't deserve your love, Nara. Don't be sad. Just watch. I won't let him destroy my happiness. Give me a week and a gallon of ice cream, and everything will be good as new. "A gallon of ice cream"? No problem, dude. Okay, dude. I believe that one day, I will find the right guy who won't leave and hurt me. Whenever she gets broken-hearted, I always cheer her up. -Exactly. -Exactly. Whenever she gets left behind, I'd always be someone she could go back to. Nara. Until… she began to fall in love again. How long it will last is unclear. Nara. Nara, you forgot this. Right. -Thanks, Mom. -Careful, dear. Okay. Kevin, you better be home on time. -All right, ma'am. -Yes, Mom. -Bye. -Bye. What did you have for breakfast? You're so heavy. How dare you! I'm not heavy. -Wait and see! -Hey, man. Careful, Nara could fall. Yes, General! What about me? I don't get the same attention from him. Just listen to him. Hey, Nara! We're too fast! Hey! Are you okay? -I'm sorry. -Okay. -Are you hurt? -I'm fine. I'm strong. Hey, strong woman. Are you okay? Stop dozing off. You might gain weight. Right. I'm not dating Bimo. Really? He doesn't want to get serious. It's all game for him. I knew it. That's it? Your best friend feels like shit. You should cheer me up. With what? A physics formula? E=mc2. "E" stands for the energy you wasted. "M." Made you eat your heart out. Times "C" squared… Caring too much. You're not funny. Don't give your heart away so easily to just anybody… if you don't want to get hurt. Is that the reason why you're always single? You are afraid to get hurt. Who said I'm single? I'm not. I'm with you. Vin, why haven't I heard about your love life? Well… I… It's… I… All this time… What? You're right. I will never give my heart away so easily again. -I have to save myself. -Nara… What? Come on, we're going to be late. Go! Good luck! Good luck, everyone. It's our last practice today. I hope everything goes smoothly tomorrow. -Amen! -Amen! What we'll do now is introduce the green lifestyle to the students here and spread it further into society. I will revise the proposal then. All right. Let's call it a day. One Tree… With a Million Benefits! -Vin, do you have plans after this? -Yes? I'm planning to take you-- Hey! I have an appointment. Okay? -Appointment with… -With… With Nara. To the bookstore. Yes, to the bookstore. See you. -What's going on? -Just go, quickly. Why won't you eat? Eat this. What is it? I think Tiara likes you. Why are you saying that? That's how it looks. Really? Yes. Just eat this vegetable a little. Don't change the subject. Do you… like Tiara? Just drop it, okay? Do you want to be single forever? I already told you, I have you. You mean… I mean… I have you as my best friend, so I won't feel lonely. Right? Right. Yes, best friend. It's on you this time. Tomorrow, I will buy you ice cream. Where are you going? Home. I thought you liked me. Are you mad at me? No. I just want to go for a walk alone. IT'S ABOUT A BROKEN-HEARTED MAN Take it easy, Ned. Sometimes, we can't beat nature. I don't want to beat nature. I want to beat myself. You look tired, son. I'm fine, Mom. Rin, get your brother a cup of coffee. I will, after this one. I'm going to my room. I'm exhausted. Okay. Rin. Thanks, Rin. Ned, you left home for days. Mom was worried. Stop doing that. Give her a break. I told her to stop worrying about me. I can take care of myself. Anyway, your campus is doing a campus day, right? Take me there with you. I want to see the dance majors. Okay, as long as you go home by yourself. All right, cool. -I'm going to take a shower. -All right. Running away from heartache won't make us any better. Sometimes, we have to feel heartache. Don't kill it. It will eventually fade away. By the time we allow ourselves to be happy, we will get something much better. -Did Rina go home? -Yes. That's the girl who yelled at you. I don't care. Hello? What are you doing? I'm sleeping. Lies. You liar. Your light is still on. What is it? I'm nervous. Tomorrow is the day of the show. Chill out. It's not your first time anyway. You are a great dancer. Wish me luck for tomorrow. I've been practicing like crazy. Best of luck with your show. Thanks, Vin. Go to sleep now. Good night, Nara. Good night, ugly. See? I knew you'd like it. -I want to grab a pamphlet. -Rin. Congratulations. Good job. Thanks. Nara. I didn't know you like to watch dance shows. Miss, you were so cool. Thank you. I'm Rina. I'm planning to study here next year after I graduate. He's my brother. Ned. Nara. Nara Senja. Ned… Juned. -Excuse me. Sorry. -Okay. -One Tree… -With a Million Benefits! Let's get to work. -Vin. -Yes. I got us a sponsor that's interested in our project this Sunday. That's great. My uncle is the CEO of PT Semesta Karya. -He agreed upon hearing about our project. -Okay. He asked for a meeting. Is the proposal ready? Well, we should prepare it together so we can meet him soon. Let's do it later. Vin, let's take a selfie first. KAMINARI Do you want to dance? We're actually in need of a male dancer. No. I'm just waiting. Waiting for what? For the rain to stop. It stopped. I'm leaving. I'm in a hurry. I think it will be easier to sell it online, Mom. Okay. Juned. If you always think that everyone will hurt you, you are wrong. Juned. Don't shut yourself off like this. Open your heart. Why are you suddenly saying this? I told her. You were so cold toward Nara. She is nice and kind. Not every girl is like Elya. You just got home? I thought it was for me. Since when do I eat glass? Look carefully. There are a few drops left. As an environmentalist, a drop of water is precious. Just spit it out. What is it? I saw Juned today. And? There's more. We talked even if it's just for a moment. The most important thing is I caught him staring at me. Do you like him? Nara. What's wrong with you? I thought you said you wouldn't give your heart away so easily. That's not how feelings work. I'm going to take a shower. Wait up. I saw the picture of you and Tiara on Instagram. You two are a match made in heaven. Stop it. Why don't you just go out with her? That's not how feelings work. But still, it won't hurt to open your heart to her. Just give it a shot! I don't want to. Vin. I want you to date someone. If you get a girl, we can go on a double date. A double date? With who? You are single. I am single. Why don't we hang out together? Vin. What? You have to ask Tiara out. Hey, I'm not finished! I am! -Ugly! -So what? If only she understood how it feels to love someone who constantly asks you to love someone else. Hey! Let's go to the canteen. Let's go. Have you tried Mr. Amin's meatballs? They say it's delicious. Vin. Your future wife is here. Here's the proposal I made. Can you check it out? Can we do it later? Can't you do it now? -Is it okay, Ra? -Cool! I love seeing you two together. What a gorgeous couple! Just hook up already, will you? Poor him. He's single all the way. How about now at the canteen? What a coincidence. Kevin is also on his way to the canteen, right? Go on. -See you later, Nara. -See you. Not funny, Nara. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. I want to apologize for what I did to you… Arrogant. Overly proud. High and mighty. Bighead. That's not what I meant. I'm just messing with you. Black coffee, as usual. Nara? A glass of lemon tea, please. All right. -Thank you. -No problem. So you can smile after all? Now you know. So what's with all the arrogance you've got going on? I have been in love with someone. I gave her all of my heart. Planning my future ahead, having high expectations… It was all destroyed. She betrayed me. Since then, I have never expected too much from anyone. Expectations only hurt me. I used to get hurt a lot. Neglected. But… I do believe that one day, love will eventually come. It will never hurt… and never leave. How's your tea? It's tasty. I'm a regular here. So you often come here? A lot. Which one do you choose? Coffee or rock climbing? Rock climbing, for sure. -So you prefer rock climbing-- -Yes. And you're fine without coffee at all? Your question is hard. For you… Thanks. …and for me. Do you want to hear my story? How about I dance? Can I? Here I go. Hey! Oh, no! I dropped my ice cream. I dropped it. I just bought it. Nara. Do you want me to date Tiara? I will do anything you want… Yes? on one condition. Tell me. What is it? I entrust my heart to you. What are you saying? I'm not a heart-keeper. You can do whatever you want with my heart. Either you keep it or throw it away. Do as you wish. You have something on your cheek. Cut it out, Vin. Stop being such a drama queen. Listen. Hear me out. I… want you to be with Tiara because, well, I think… it's time for you to let people in. Let people love you. Let yourself be loved. Just like normal people would do. All right? I want to… I want you to experience love. Just like how I felt when I fell in love with Juned. Vin. Wait, Vin. Why… Look at your face. You're such a mess. I'll get a tissue for you. I'm going, Mom. -Wait, here's your coffee. -Coffee… Where are you going? Why are you in a hurry? It's the weekend. -Can I have this, Rin? -Make your own sandwich! I'm going, Mom. Goodbye. -Bye. -Be careful. -He looks happy. -Totally. The air is so refreshing! Are you feeling cold, Nara? No. There's a monkey. Look, over there. There are a lot of them here. They're all my friends. Come on. -There? -Follow me. It's slippery. Here… -We should rest here. -No. I can't wait to see your place. We have to enjoy the view before we go to my favorite place. Let's sit here. Be careful. It's my getaway place whenever I want to be alone. You always come here alone? You are the first person I brought here. Really now? I mean it. -Me? -You. Anyway… It's an amazing place up ahead. More amazing than this? Much more than this. So… what are we waiting for? Let's go. Here you go. Where's your girlfriend? She has other plans. Enjoy. -Thank you. -Thank you. Girlfriend? Nara. She and I often went here. It's her favorite ice cream café. Can I take a picture? What's on your mind? Nothing. Do you know why I joined the Taring Community? I want to live like a tree. Come again? You see, a tree will always stay in the same spot where it grows, soaking up the sun with joy. Even if the sun is away from it, it always believes. The sun will always help the tree live longer. Nara! Come here. Come here! Do you want another sip? I'm good. What is it? I know that I haven't proven my worth yet to gain your trust. But I can't lie. I'm falling for you, Nara Senja. I'll hold your backpack. My backpack? Seriously? I can do it. Let's go. I'll help you. Hold on. Thanks. Thanks for today. Thank you so much, Uncle. Sure, no problem. How is your family? Good? They're all fine. When will you come to visit us? I'll visit when I have time. Kevin. Our company supports your project for the environment. Thank you, sir. We support your project. What is it called again? One Tree… -With a Million Benefits. -With a Million Benefits. -All right, Uncle. -I have a guest. -Just enjoy your time here. -Thank you, sir. -Hi. -Good day, Mr. Rizal. Thank you for your support on the Supermodels Project. That's one brilliant idea. Shall we discuss it? Bye. Yes. What can I get you? One coffee latte. Iced Americano, please. Congratulations. For what? Your project. You have a sponsor now. Our project. It's all because of your hard work. Without you, we wouldn't be able to find a sponsor so easily. I'm sorry. All this time, it seems like I haven't appreciated you much, despite all of your big contributions to Taring. Thank you. Thank you. After you graduate, what's your plan? I… Why so curious? Please be serious. Miss. Please do not use straws. Thank you. Vin. What is it? I'm sleepy. Juned's birthday is coming soon. I want to give him a present. A special one. But what should I buy? You woke me up in the middle of the night… just for this? Help me out, Vin. Help me pick a meaningful gift tomorrow. He is so nice to me. I want to give him a gift. Okay? Vin. What's wrong with you? It feels like you've changed recently. Okay. I'll take you there. Thank you. All right, go back to sleep. -Bye. -Bye. See. I'm so glad I brought you along. You are a real savior. Juned loves this stuff. This one is cute. -I'm trying this on. -Go on. Do I look cool? -Cool. -Hey, put this on. -Which one? -Here. Here you go. Try it on. Put this on. Do I look cool? Cool, dude. So cold. Awesome. It's hot. This one is cute, isn't it? Do you like it? Here, put this on. Do you want to buy this one? I'm just trying it out. How is it? Do you like it? I like it. I think there's more over there. Vin! So… I applied for an internship as a biology teacher at Pertiwi High School. Do you want me to apply for you, so we can teach together? What do you think? I'm not sure. I should ask… I have to ask my parents first. Gosh, Vin. It's time to think about your future. Stop relying on other people. Vin… Gosh. I'm sorry to interrupt your date. Anyway, I want to throw Juned a surprise birthday celebration. And I want you two to come. What do you think? Will you come? Why should we come? We don't even know him well. Why don't you two celebrate it? We rarely hang out together. We can have a double date. Okay. I'm fine with it. We can get to know Juned even better. Right, Vin? Okay then. Thank you, Vin. Thank you so much, Tiara. Sure. I'll send you the details later. Just wait. See you. Hold on. You look lovely today. Do I usually look like a beggar? No matter what, you always look pretty to me, Nara. -Hi! -Hi! I'm glad you can make it. Thank you! You asked Kevin to come? Yes. Is this your idea? Thank you, babe. -Blow it out. -Happy birthday. Blow out the candles. Great. Happy birthday, babe. Thank you for coming. Of course. I have something for you. She's full of surprises. Totally. You better get used to it. Since when have you known each other? Since we were little kids. First grade. Just like siblings. This is for you. Thanks, babe. You're welcome. What's this? -Can I open it? -It's a secret. Just open it. You'll find it very useful, man. He helped me pick a gift for you. I consider him my savior. I don't know how I'd be without him. Whenever she gets in trouble, I fix it for her. Whenever she feels sad, I always stay by her side. Thank you, Vin. Look at this. It's not my birthday, but she gave me this. I don't care even if I don't get a gift. As long as I have you, Nara. Where's my gift? Do you still need more? We came here. Isn't that enough? Juned. I found this. Where is its mom? Poor little bird. I feel sorry for it. Let's head over there. Let's go. What's wrong with you? I'm fine, Nara. You're acting strange. Are you really all right? Do you really love me? Of course. Why? Don't you trust me? I will go rock climbing this week. What? Why so sudden, Ned? Ned… Are you leaving because you're mad at me? -Of course not. -Forgive me, Ned. We will stay like this forever, right? We will, Nara. Promise? I promise. Why are we here if you won't say anything? Vin. We got accepted as interns at Pertiwi High School. For the next step, I can no longer-- Tiara. Thank you for your attention and kindness toward me until now. Too bad I'm not Nara. All along, you've been wishing it was her attention, not mine, right? She belongs to someone else. And now… I want to start something new with you. Hello, babe. Where are you? I just got here. -We are taking a quick break. -Okay. Come home soon. I miss you already. Yes, babe. I'm going home tomorrow. Bye. Why did you suddenly want to go here? Did you and Nara fight? Come on, Ned. Be careful. Take it easy, Ned! Watch your step. Watch out! Careful, Rid. Ned! Wake up, Ned! Watch out, Rid! On your left! Wake up, Ned! Juned! Answer me, Ned. Why won't you answer? Why does he keep ignoring my calls? Maybe he's on his way home. Hello. Ned. Where have you been? I kept calling you. What? Well… How is he? Is he okay? What? CITRA MADYA GENERAL HOSPITAL Rina. -Nara… -What's wrong? What's wrong with Juned? Tell me! Son… No! Juned! No! Impossible! You promised you wouldn't leave me! No! Juned! You promised me! BORN: PADANG DIED: JAKARTA Please pray for him. -Nara, your mom and I will go ahead. -Yes. Ma'am, we're leaving. Tiara. Can you go home by yourself? I have to stay with Nara. Take care. Kevin. -Take care of Nara. -Yes, sir. She's still in shock. -Thank you. -Okay, ma'am. Come on, dear. Nara… I want to thank you. Ever since Juned met you, he became so much happier. So now we have 50 seeds that we can plant at three different spots. Indramayu, Karawang, and Padalarang. So where should we go first? Your mom said you won't eat. Don't be like that, Nara. You might get sick. Eat up. Open wide. Tell me. How can I ease your heart? Juned promised… He promised he wouldn't leave and hurt me. Where is he now? He's not here. I'm all alone. What did I do wrong, Vin? Why does everyone leave me? Come on. Let him go. Juned is gone. Not everyone left. I'm still here. You will, eventually. No, I won't. I would never leave. And it's not your fault. It's not your fault. Now please eat. Just drink the soup… to fill your stomach. Okay? Okay? Nara. Have some of this. Open wide. Open wide. It's all over your face. So… When will you come back to class? Go home already. It's my bedtime. We should start making the Earth Day schedule, Vin. Yes. I'll send you a reference. Don't forget to post it on our social media to raise awareness. Great. What's wrong, Vin? Today, Nara is back on campus. So? Later, Tiara. Nara! How's your day? -It's great. -Great? Where did you get this umbrella? My teacher gave it to me. -It's a welcome back gift. -Welcome back. -Not going home yet, are you? -No. -Where are you going? -Canteen. -Let's go. -Let's go. Vin. What's up, Tiara? Do you know how it feels… when you are with someone but his heart is somewhere else? Why are you pretending that you're in love with me? If you love Nara, why don't you tell her? Nara! Go on. Go after your Nara. I don't want to stand between you and her. Nara! Leave me alone! Are you mad at me, Nara? Nara. I watched you dance for so long. I want you to let it all out. Your sadness, your anger, your disappointment. Just let it out. I promise… I won't let even a single drop of rain get on you. That's enough. Just forget him. A guy like him doesn't deserve your love, Nara. You are single. I am single. Why don't we hang out together? I will do anything you want… on one condition. Tell me. What is it? I entrust my heart to you. All this time, I was afraid to tell you how I feel. I never had the courage. I was afraid you would leave me. But now, I don't care anymore. Even if you hate me. I learned from the rain. The rain is never afraid of falling to the Earth. And today, I am the rain. And I want you to know that I am the man who fell for his own best friend. I'm also tired of being your best friend. Care to share the umbrella? I'm sorry, Kevin. Subtitle translation by: Arif Komarudin
