That year, on her birthday I showed her a glass bottle The bottle was filled with lucky stars of every color She looked at that bottle of stars and, just like you all, was giddy with delight How many are in here? All together, nine hundred and ninety-nine That's all? Well, if you want more just keep those smiles coming Now in our home, we have forty eight bottles 48,964 lucky stars My luck has only ever gotten better if you keep making them, won't you run out of room? That is a question of land which can only be solved with money And that's why I'm here selling you all books! Just kidding Actually, so long as you have love any problem can be fixed Why didn't you pick the kid up on the way? There's an eval form on the table for the head of household Bring it back to the school once you've filled it out You're not going? I just went down to help you list the flat You want me going out again? Which agencies? Centreland, of course We only have the one key And you couldn't have more made? I'd have two more blocks to walk A sole agent is good, too Fewer random people out to kill time Hey, this is the mother's assessment You've always been the one to fill those out You're the writer Come to think of it, ever since we signed the marriage certificate I have yet to see a pen in your hand Do you even still know how to write? I can type. That's good enough Hey! Honey Two blocks really is far We're out of condoms Again? Really! Be a good boy and buy some and while you're out, pick up the kid Okay? Go on Go go go! Hey! Please? Love you! Of course, I don't have 48 bottles of lucky stars at home Because my wife simply isn't the perfect woman from the novel She's actually a lazy cunt! Were you a good little boy today? Ming was very well behaved Is that so? Okay, let's say goodbye to the teacher Bye! Hello? Hi, Mr. Xu? It's Jason from Centreland I have a client who wants to rent your flat upstairs! Already? Of course! I'm taking special care of your account So take them up to see it She's a good client A single woman. What do you think? That so? Hong Kong's South Harbour, with mountains and the sea I'd love to live in such a location Here, let's have a look at the view Such a spacious place, for forty-eight thousand, basically can't be found in this district Mr. Xu! Let me introduce Miss Chan Miss Chan, This is Mr. Xu You can see he's a good-looking, handsome gent, generous, and a Leo! Hard to find landlords like him in this area That's enough. Thanks so much I'll take care of this ASAP, then ring you back. Would this be disrespectful? Nonsense How do I know she didn't leave a couple of bombs in here? That's enough to warrant a peek Victoria's secrets sure are big Hi, Mr. Xu? It's Jason Miss Chan from earlier said she really likes your place but she only has a budget of thirty thousand Thirty thousand? She knows it's too much of a stretch And says if it's not okay, then never mind Hang on a second Hi, Mr. Xu? I seem to have left a bag at your place but don't you dare open it Mr. Xu? Tell her no free months if she's okay with that, get her signed. Bye Honey! What? Look at this Thirty thousand for rent at the Royal Cullinan? It's haunted ls ours rented out yet? At the going rate. I'm off for a swim Mr. Xu, what a coincidence Hey, you're bleeding Is it bad? Let me see Say cheese Are you okay? I'm fine You don't need to work today? I do insurance so my time's pretty free You're Japanese? My daddy's from Hong Kong Mom is Japanese I only came here when I was twelve I heard from the agent that you're an author Yeah I'll give you one of my books next time My Chinese is terrible I prefer watching movies What kind do you like? Lust, Caution; 9Â½ Weeks; and Fifty Shades of Grey I really like those Wow, all good ones Maybe when there's a chance, we could discuss them together I'm off Chat next time Did you heat up some water? Fresh off the boil Pour me some "Your savings account number 382-345987-883 has received a transfer of $15,000" Mr. Xu, what's up? I checked my account and it seems the numbers are a bit off Really? When you get a chance come up and get the rest I have cash Oh, alright Also, I think I dropped a stocking down to your place Could you bring it by later while you're at it? Honey! I'm going down to the gym for a workout Mr. Xu Elaine Come in and have a seat Okay Have a drink Thanks Mr. Xu, about this place I want to share it with someone You're the tenant Whom you want to live with isn't really up to me You know how it is insurance work isn't so stable it's certainly better to share it with someone! That's true But what if I want to share it with you? Then you could stay over any time you wanted You can see I'm no child if you weren't interested in me you wouldn't have cut my rent by eighteen thousand You are quite direct If you're okay with it then please help me put on the other stocking Why is this one shorter? It soaked in hot water and shrank But it's coming off anyway, right? Do you have a condom? No need. I'm on the pill Why didn't I hear you come back? I thought you were asleep Honey, I'm off for a workout! Hey, have you looked up Doong? No, why? He's being charged with rape! He says she changed her story after the fact Why didn't he call me? You'd take his case? I'd find him someone to beat the bitch up! Dude, you're an attorney! So, you have to use the most effective method Let's drop the topic. It's depressing. I went to Taiwan recently Let's hear it You guys ever gone dancing surrounded by eight hotties? I have. For real! Then what? Well, I couldn't handle all eight even if I wanted and it's not economically advantageous So I picked one, the very ugliest one Which means she didn't have any customers Which means she had to be clean! But Taiwanese girls are known to be easy to catch, hard to shake Aren't you worried she'll tail you to Hong Kong? (Mandarin-ish) No worries! She's a part-timer Her husband was off on business With no one to busy her at home, she goes out to get busy I threw in an extra two grand and she even lent me his car Pretty good cost-benefit ratio, eh? That is lower than low Pretty serious business As if you wouldn't? Sorry! I shouldn't be bringing this stuff up You're an idiot Jay has a wife Having a wife isn't the problem It's that his wife has problems Even now, we still remember what happened Five years ago Hey, why did you come so late? Come on and catch up with the rest of us! Who are you? - Mrs. Xu, don't! - Don't get worked up! You scared off all my customers! You've ruined my establishment! Ruined it! If I call the cops, your wife will go to jail for life! Would you like a receipt, Mr. Xu? No need, thanks Go get some tea for the lady! Standing there like an idiot Alright Look, it's really our fault But I really want to know, how did you find this place? I checked his messages You said you booked a room for hotpot at Kai Kee, right? Then you replied with a sly smiley So let me ask if you're having hotpot, then why the hell do you need a sly smiley? There are only four nightclubs in Hong Kong using "Kai" New Kai Lee, Chiu Kai Yan, New Chiu Kai, and Kam Fan Kai I flushed you out by the second one! If there's ever a next time, it will be over your son's dead body and mine If I had a Sherlock like her at home, I'd just take up some other interests and be done with Like meditation. Or prayer As for part-timers and Taiwanese girls, don't even think about it Sherlock is on the way Get on out of here Then I'm leaving So, leave Like that? Yeah Could I not pay rent this month? None at all? If not, then fine You're stingy for a billionaire, You really do take me for Gray (Japanese) 'Yamete'! What's that for? 'Yamete'? You crying stop because of rent? You crazy? Or you want me to rape you, huh? That hurts! Can't I scream in pain? Goddammit I, Elaine Chan, do not object to Jay Xu, at Royal Cullinan 1 Building 6, Apartment 28A, doing whatever he pleases to me Each month, I will pay fifteen thousand in rent Satisfied? A notice of non-objection? What, it's not like I'm pressuring you for rent Pay when you can No 'Yamete' I'd rather 'kimochii' Kiki, close the shades, will you? Your wife's name is Kiki? Oh shit! You just get back? Got drunk last night Couldn't sleep on the couch So I went down to get some breakfast Go wash up and come eat Okay Honey, I'm off to the gym! Honey! I'll go with you You're coming with me? Yeah To the gym? Starting now, I'm going along every day Great Mr. Xu? I have a classmate who's one of your fans Could you sign the cover of your book for her? Sure What, are you trying to get her? I've got a date with her tonight! You must be excited I'm OK with it Could you also draw something on the cover? I only know how to write I can't draw It doesn't matter She'll like any old crap you'd make Okay Thank you This cactus embodies the love you two have No matter how vile the conditions may be, may it grow healthy and strong Go for it. You can do it "Surely you have time to take out the garbage" Time to clean up I'll give you half a minute Someone might see us Time's up. Bye-bye! Could you not be so random? A flick of a sleeve and she's gone without taking half a drop Yes, I know I'm ridiculous A wife and a mistress, both no more than ten steps away, yet here I am in a stairwell, dealing with it myself I asked for raw beef and they give me cooked Fried chicken, and the skin is mush No comparison to Seoul You're a fool if you want to compare that with what's in Seoul Hey honey, the Seoul Marriott is running a promotion Just over a thousand a night What's the deadline? Let's see Ten tonight, but departing tomorrow Too rushed Since we don't have jobs to go to, of course we should be doing off season trips It's cheaper and more convenient Better check if auntie would be okay taking care of Ming Of course she would! Nevermind, I'll book it first All set! Hey, what's up? Let's do this, Jay 1 , 2... No way. You're only telling me now? 3, 4...5, 6, 7... I booked tickets and a hotel for Seoul tomorrow with my wife I don't care, you deal with it, end of story What's up? Nothing Just ignore it It's okay! Hi, Hi Kiki, it's Jim The big guy says he booked a trip with you, but a client just opened up a venue for him to do another reading And you know doing more of those means more sales, right? Well, alright I'll tell him to get back to you It's fine. Work is more important What about the package? Would you be upset if I went by myself? No way, too dangerous! Have Jenny go with you I'll call and ask her Hello, Jenny? You free tomorrow? Let's go to Korea Eat something, baby "A friendly reminder: during the coming week," "I will be very free," "but you will be very busy" "I'll think it over" "If we're going to be meeting so often," "could you add a little extra for living expenses?" What damned living expenses? In Hong Kong, housing is already the biggest living expense! "How about ten to thirty thousand a month?" "I have a ton of expenses. Ten thousand a month, OK?" You're mommy's who, baby? Mommy's little darling You're mommy's who? Mommy's little darling! I love you so much! Bye, honey Okay, you go play with daddy. Take my hand. Bye-bye mommy. Bye bye! Ming, when the door opens, say hi to 'big brother'! Big brother You are rather clever! You're a cutie, Ming Why are you so cute? You're pretty cute yourself Hey, don't. Not in front of Ming I want to get changed Clever boy! You know, if you don't want to come out with me, I won't mind No. It's just that we're lying in bed together This is a public venue, so it's not quite right Your wife always looks so bitchy What do you see in her? Actually, back in middle school, she was pretty hot And yet you cheat on her? But it's because now I found my true love True love? You're better off truly making love Your Chinese has really improved I want to put a hammock up at home, too But where you're renting, if you want to drill any holes, you have to ask the landlord Mister landlord, can I drill some holes upstairs? As far as drilling holes goes... Wow, honey. You brought all of Seoul back with you But they were all really good deals See what happens if I use a bigger suitcase You have a point "The warden is back, but I want to watch a movie tonight, OK?" "OK! 30k per private showing, OK?" "Full House" Hey, stop I said we're out of condoms Again? Did you buy any? You go to Korea and buy all this, but you won't buy condoms You're out of your mind! Going to Korea just to buy condoms? It's not important And if I get pregnant you'll carry it? Great. I'm off to the gym This time, I actually hit the gym because I was pissed! Thirty grand for one session? Am I some kind of chump? But denying this chump's bottom line makes him so completely empty, so totally lonesome... Hello? Hey, Jay Get any inspiration? The book fair is coming fast You're insane. What's that got to do with me? Am I Alpha Go? Then how about the title, so I can promote it first, huh? Don't have one. Bye You don't sound like that when you want me sweet-talking your wife, you ass! Electromagnetic launches rely on electromagnetic force... ...foreign media say the nuclear-powered USS Gerald Ford has a method for aircraft to reach flight velocity or near-flight velocity instantaneously Simply put, electricity creates the magnetic force... ...Using steam-powered catapults, Mr. Xu, what a coincidence Honey, you've got something on you Bye! My stomach hurts Go pick up our son and then get me some medicine Okay Okay. Call me when you're back upstairs Okay Bye-bye, teacher Bye-bye! Excuse me! Mr. Xu? Where's my son? Ming's auntie already picked him up Which auntie? Ming's, but he called her big brother Are you joking? You guys hand my son to just anybody? But Ming hugged her really warmly He'd hug Mickey Mouse if he came! Could Mickey Mouse pick my son up? But she had a pick-up authorization letter Even with a letter, you could still get a good look at her, couldn't you? Where did they go? I don't recall How about I ask the headmaster if we should call the police? Forget it! Ridiculous Elaine! What are you doing picking him up from school? Because I missed him I haven't had much income lately Could you loan me fifty thousand? Thirty to sleep with you, fifty to not Have you lost your damned mind? Why are you so angry? I'm just asking to borrow money Just what is it you're dealing with? When you're always coming around, how do I have time to earn money? Are you letting me sleep around? Go have your fill, if you want Ming! Hello, Mr. Xu Well, can I? Hey...Can I? Fine Once again, I thank you all for attending the discussion Thank you! You've all just heard from Mr. Jay Xu I trust you have a lot of questions for him about relations between the sexes, right? So what say we ask him some questions How about it? This young lady in the front can go first Thank you I'd like to ask, if your wife were to start a fight for no reason, what would you do? Each person's home is a place of last retreat It's where you talk of love, not reason Since there is no talk of reason, when why start a fight for no reason? Are there any other questions? I have one The one young lady with her back turned If you love your wife so much, do you think you'd sneak some on the side? Actually, I love doing that the most Especially when she cooks, As I watch, I sneak some on the side I'm asking if you would cheat on her with other women I'd once heard about a married couple in the process of getting divorced Then one day, the wife was in an accident She lost her memory When she woke, she thought she still deeply loved her husband Now, say I walked out this door and a sign dropped on my head and I lost my mind, that could also happen, right? Are there any other questions? How about the young lady in the back? I also want to know if you might have an affair! I dare not say that I wouldn't I can only say I wouldn't dare You're all satisfied, right? Since you've waited so long, how about we go straight to the autograph and photo segment, okay? Thank you - Here's a new friend. Your name is - Yan Yan, okay Excuse me, sorry! I haven't bought your books I want to take a photo with you Better wire me that money later Thank you Thank you - Hello, and you are... - Charlie Charlie "Your savings account number 382-345987-883 has transferred $50,000" "to UOB (HONG KONG) Limited with account number 382-716XXX-883" Honey What? What's that about? I'll go down to management to have it checked out The security guard was on patrol I had to wait a while before seeing him if there's no more noise, then forget it Hey, big-shot author She's busting out on you Even posted the goods on your page She sure has the goods if I have you on video, you can bet I want more than thirty thousand Bottom line, ten million Are you blackmailing me? Putting it nicely, a transaction Not nicely, it's blackmail Not saying I don't have it, but if I did, I wouldn't give it to you, right? Stop pretending All together, your twelve properties are at least a hundred million I walk down one floor and you're out half of that Ten million is a bargain That's enough to pay someone to off you ten times over, you got that? If I die out of the blue, someone will post it online automatically I'm a movie nut Surely you know that storyline I'm a very reasonable person Getting ten million just like that is a little difficult Make it five days Wow that is one pricey bag of pork rinds Honestly, do you even have ten mil? Even if I did, I wouldn't just pay up, right? Two choices, Either acid or have her whacked Or use acid to whack her Didn't you say two choices? I just thought up the third Like I said, if the jap girl dies, someone uploads the video, don't you get it? Who's she kidding? She tries to scare you, so scare her back It's simple. Find some guys to keep her in the house Beat her up first, then rape her After raping, beat her up again Rape again, beat again Repeat a few times and see if she still wants to play You are a lawyer! Just saying. ls just talking about it a crime? That's why I never pick up women Getting hookers is the best bet, am I right? Right now, you can only expose it yourself That won't look so bad But remember to first get a recording of her for proof, as evidence that she was blackmailing you Worst case, you both go down And after that, his wife will take half, right? But this time is really something Upstairs and down? Sherlock didn't figure it out? She must have - She just hasn't said anything - You're crazy His wife is insane. If she knew, wouldn't she go up there and chop up that Jap witch? That is true Thinking this through, really having her whacked may not be impossible Let's say, you tell her the money is all set Exchange the money for the goods Once she's handed over all the copies, kill her on the spot. Hey, you're a lawyer! Killing is never hard The hard part is getting away with it Right, so how do you get away with it? If you can't find the body! Have you watched Breaking Bad? Sulfuric acid can dissolve a body But you need to get a plastic barrel big enough to put a body in But with a barrel that big, it's hard to move around without getting noticed Cut her up. But if you do, blood will get everywhere, splatter everywhere So then what? Buy a body bag, put the body in, then cut Then it's neat and tidy It sounds like you've actually done this before I haven't, but I will try it on my wife Missing the body doesn't mean you can't be found guilty Just like the case last time Also a murdered mistress! Hey, then the one with the dismembered prostitute! They got the guy on that one, too! The killer in the hooker case came out and admitted it You wouldn't! The mistress one had security footage of the killer going to the crime scene What advantages do you have? Upstairs, downstairs, and the stairwell Any security cameras there? Have you had enough fun? Then just go pull out the ten million How's that? Let's crack a 30 year-old vintage. He's got 10 mil in cash Mommy doesn't want you! You like 'big brother' that much? And you said I was your darling! I don't want you! Go! Mrs. Xu, you have to be patient with children Get lost! What's it to you how I raise my son? Honey, what are you doing? Your wife's temper is really bad today She's been stuck at home taking care of him lately It's a lot of pressure It'll be fine Then I'll be on my way Thank you It'll be fine What are you suddenly installing a camera? I figure even if we're out, we can keep an eye on the house You worried I'll abuse your son? Ridiculous When I'm thinking of you two, then I can see you I don't like it What is it, Mr. Chan? Mr. Xu? The ten million you requested has been prepared Come to our branch any time to pick it up Fine. Thank you Now, we're only having one No more crying to daddy, understand? "Tomorrow night at 9. See you at the theatre!" Let's go Hey, why isn't the coroner's van here yet? It's on its way Judging by the damage to the body, she must've fallen from between floors 25 and 30 Likely from either of these two units See who lives up there Yes, sir! On it! Hey! Get some grub first, detective I'm really scared I'm really scared I want to get away from here Go back to Canada for now, okay? I really want to get out of here! Go to your mother's and lay low, alright? I'll take care of it, okay? Okay Everything will be fine The pathologist opened up the body Cause of death, fall from elevation, without a doubt Turns out Jay Xu was her landlord and lived right below her Jay who? You don't know who Jay Xu is? Are you serious? Never even heard of him Naturally. You never even went to school Of course you don't know him What was that? Does schooling make you the boss? Write up your report Thanks, Mr. Xu Our guys will have a look around Take it easy Were you close with the deceased? Same as any normal landlord-tenant relationship Inspector Lee Thanks so much, Mr. Xu We'll be taking the phone with us No problem Have the examiner send over a detailed autopsy report Tell him I'll be right over to have a look at the body Check her phone records, computer, friends and family And check her bank account Yes, sir! Hey! Stop playing around on that Facebook stuff Get to work Mr. Xu. Please come back with us for a chat Mr. Xu, did you know Elaine Chan before renting the flat to her? No I rented it to her through an agent Your unit's going rate should be forty to fifty grand Why rent it to her so cheap? Good tenants are hard to find, inspector And you knew she'd be a good tenant? I saw her tax return She looked like a proper lady Her income was okay, so I rented it to her After renting it out, did you have any particular contact with her? Nothing special Just the typical landlord-tenant sort Really? L, Elaine Chan, do not object to Jay doing whatever he pleases to me at Royal Cullinan 1 , Building 6, Apartment 28A Any recollection of this? It was found in her apartment Nothing to say? Let him see it Do you still maintain that you had no particular relationship with Elaine Chan? After renting my place, she quickly became my mistress, so I cut her rent Don't you deeply love your wife? When I was in college, I liked you I even hoped to find a husband who was like you Scumbag You're a liar! Get out of here! Go! Sorry about that Careful Let me get the chair for you A little hard to take, for one of your dedicated fans, I hope you don't mind What was your involvement in Elaine Chan's death? Our relationship was about money and sex Until one day, she wanted me to get a divorce The day before she died, I even told her really harshly, We're only sex partners You think she killed herself out of love? She said she'd kill herself Or you just want us to think she killed herself for love We found copper patina under Elaine Chan's right hand nails, identical to the railing of the balcony you rented her If you're going to jump, you jump Why clutch at the railing? But personally I tend to believe that she was pushed over and that's when she scratched the railing Meaning she was murdered Where were you when it happened? 10 million. I won't say anything to your wife and I'll move out immediately You call that blackmail? You could blab whenever you wanted Fine. Ahh! Don't! Jay, don't! Hey, shut up! Shut up! She kept asking me for money She started it with the blackmail! She looked like a proper lady I saw her taxes Her income was okay, so I rented it to her Pause it None of you see anything wrong? What's the problem? He's clearly licking his lips and rubbing his fingers Those are two subtle motions for self-comfort People usually do this when uneasy or telling a lie Continue Stop! When people lie, blood rushes to the head The nose dilates a fraction of a millimeter So you will touch it unexpectedly Sir, he already admitted to lying So why are we still going over this? I want to confirm that each of his lies follows a pattern She tried to blackmail me first! What's wrong with that? When he's talking here, the pitch goes up. A higher tone is used when hiding internal anxiety So I believe that even here, he is still lying Really? I don't notice anything I do. It's clearly higher-pitched Just because he said something half a note higher? You don't think this whole thing is too easy? This is murder if it was you, would you admit guilt so easily? He knows he's trapped and confessed to get a lighter sentence And if he didn't confess, would we have enough on him to put him away? Elaine Chan paid reduced rent That "non-objection" slip And the CCTV footage All prove they were involved The forensics report shows that she was pushed over But we're far from proving it was Jay who pushed her I think he's hiding something There's dirt on him. I exposed his lies and he admits to it. What's so wrong with that? Have you read his books? They're just for fooling young girls He didn't use to write that kind of stuff His first two were murder mysteries As an electrical-engineering graduate his early frictional works were science-filled It was after switching to writing about relationships that he became popular So how does an author of murder mysteries not know about something called 'remaining silent'? Officer, I need to go Stand over there I really need to pee, officer! How much can you possibly pee? Why do you want to confess? I killed her So I admit it You look like a mess Feeling guilty about the murder? Worried about serving life? Or is it from taking diuretic pills? You used to take them when you did bodybuilding You drop a few pounds right away Same as you have right now Inspector, I have nothing to say Leak to the press that he admits Elaine Chan was his mistress and that he pushed her over See how the internet reacts Yes, sir! Should we have PR call reporters and bring him along to re-enact the crime? Inspector So Ming threw a tantrum today I tossed him out the door Then my husband said to go see Dr. Miu I wanted to say that even if I was crazy, he made me that way Thirty thousand for rent at the Cullinan? Is that even possible? Haunted? Why did he have to lie? Who did he rent it to? Nothing but a prostitute! Want to mess with my husband? Don't count on it! Miu Jee-Kan We're looking for Doctor Miu Oh, the doctor is quite busy today Perhaps you both could take a seat while you wait Sure, thanks You can sit over here Thanks Ah, Miss Chan, we're about to order some food What would you like? I'll put it in for you I'm on a diet You just get back? Couldn't sleep on the couch, so I went down to get some breakfast Go wash up and come eat Okay I know that my husband is already involved with that witch! I won't let her get away with this! I have a classmate who's one of your fans Could you sign the cover of your book for her? Sure Keeping an eye on him all day is no solution I have to drive that bitch out! Hello, Jenny? You free tomorrow? Let's go to Korea I've decided to hide a camera Mess with my husband again and I'll post the video online Then we'll see how you get your next meal ticket! Bye-bye Mommy! Right this way Doctor Miu said he prescribed some medication Come around here to pick it up Excuse us, Doctor Miu I'm superintendent Wai-Hung Soh, from the South Harbor precinct There's some information about your patient, Kiki Tang, that I want to ask you about Superintendent, barging onto private property is already a gross violation And then you want me to provide patient information? Do you know that information is private? Do you think I'd give it to you? We're not just wandering in When the police act, they come prepared You likely haven't told your wife you hired a nurse with such a fine figure, right? Nicely done Kiki Tang. She came to see me a few years ago She was depressed, would frequently busy her mind over pointless things The friends she had told me she lied all the time Patients like these typically don't think they have a problem I prescribed some medication anyway Whether she took it I really can't say, however I have not seen her again since Would you like some coffee? Do you have any whisky? Superintendent? How did you know he doctor was sleeping with the nurse? Because she really has quite a rack on her And yet she does no work The one who's actually working has to be polite to her And she's not sleeping with her boss? Sir! Sir! Yes? I found this robe in Jay Xu's apartment Nails from the deceased had fibers from this robe Could it be his wife went crazy, killed the mistress, then Jay felt so guilty, he took the fall for her? How much guilt is needed for that to happen? I found the first officer on the scene that night He told me that, just as he arrived, he saw Jay returning in a cab immigration said he'd returned from Macau at 2:30 am He wasn't at the scene Have you located his wife? Working on it Keep the change Did you push Elaine Chan off the building? Of course not! Then why did you move out once she died? Someone in the building died I was too scared, so I moved out Why lie to Jay and say you'd go to Canada? When Elaine Chan died, she was wearing this shirt We tested it and found your skin tissue on it Additionally, we found threads on her nails, threads belonging to this robe This is yours, isn't it? We found this diary in your house This is yours, is it not? I've never kept a diary This diary is not mine You wrote this, right? The handwriting is exactly the same It was Jay who pushed this person off It really has nothing to do with me I know nothing about it He set me up Mrs. Xu, don't get so worked up Actually, your husband already confessed that he was the one who pushed her over Well, there you go So charge him Why bring me here? Sir, it's been nearly forty-eight hours If we don't charge him, we'll have to let him go Jay Xu confesses, but has proof he wasn't there All the evidence goes against Kiki, but she absolutely swears Jay is the killer So who do we charge? Or do we charge neither one? I told the cops everything Confessed to it all I don't know why they still let me go I have to change his fecal bag Would you like to step outside first? It's okay. I want to keep him company Hold on, we'll be done soon Stay strong, dad Please keep an eye on my dad I need to step out for a moment Your father's condition isn't very promising I think you'd better be prepared The fees here aren't cheap Can you handle them? That's not an issue You have to stay strong Okay? Lucky thing you ran into an old classmate like me, when you most needed help Honey, is the milk ready, yet? Coming He fell asleep?

Once we got married, was I so lucky? Would you be with me if I didn't have tens of millions to inherit?

Lee, Hand this to the Department of Justice, Superintendent, I still feel like something's off All the the evidence pointing to Kiki was found in her home She did the crime What's so wrong with finding the evidence in her house? Kiki is too simple Killing someone and getting away with it isn't actually so easy What are you suddenly installing a camera? I figure even if we're out, we can keep an eye on the house Everything will be okay Almost done I have to check the video Okay! Killing is never hard The hard part is getting away with it I know my husband's already involved with that witch! I can't let him go on with this! The fake diary was to lead the cops to her doctor, so they'd know she had a record of mood disorders. You're sure all the copies are here?

The nuclear-powered USS Gerald Ford has a method for aircraft to reach flight velocity or near-flight velocity instantaneously Simply put, electricity creates the magnetic force... ...Using steam-powered catapults, "Macau Ferry Terminal - Sheung Wan" What advantages do you have?

Knowing that I'd framed her, Kiki would go crazy. Once that happened, the trap was sprung. To everyone else, Jay Xu was ever the loving husband, father, and writer. Meanwhile, Kiki was eventually sent to a mental institute I once read this saying that I find so intelligent The cruelest lies are often told in silence After all, I, too, am an intelligent writer
