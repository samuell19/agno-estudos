Hey Pierre! You've set traps again. I forbade you. But Herr Baron loves to eat rabbit fat. That's bad without rabbits. Then you just buy from the forest warden. You can't do that without money. A rabbit costs 30 sou. Then I give it up. I don't want strangers. Keep the two. They're dead and too good for the robbery. They taste better than dry bread. This makes a juicy ragout. Do not lead me into temptation. I'm already half starved. Throw that stuff away! Home! I'll be right there. Lord Baron! In the bowl you can't see that they are stolen. I'm afraid, friends, we're lost. If we ride this way, we're sure to meet the hunting party. Stop, beautiful woman! Please help poor comedians! The horse shies! Help! Help! Help! Help! That's how you hear it! Here! Help! Help! Here! Here! I fall! Over here Jean! Help! Help! Help! Oh, Marquis, I'm dead. Oh! I thought it was my husband. Unfortunately not. Don't be intrusive! Please Jean! Give the man a reward. I'm afraid he doesn't accept your reward, Marquise. - How come? Her savior is the Baron de Sigognac. My wife, the Marquise de Bruyere. Baron de... Forgive my mistake! They're in an elevator... Do you like hunting here? Hare hunting remained my only hunting pleasure. Honestly, I'm a poacher. But you're already punishing me by not smiling anymore. Thank you madam! I will remain your debtor forever. Goodbye, Marquis. Goodbye, baron. And good luck as a poacher. Hello! Is there a wagon smith nearby? A wagon maker is 12 hours away. Fate is against us. We have to sleep outside. In the cold? We warm up and practice our roles. Comedians are you? Not just comedians. Little provincial actors. Herod, leader of the unique group. Forgive me, I live like a savage here. You can see that. What are you doing? I? Nothing. I am Baron de Sigognac. Then I am Tsar of all Russias or King of Denmark. You can be a baron and still be poor. It's like a comedian with no commitment. Money is not important. I shouldn't be said to let the muses down. Be my guests tonight! I don't know if we can accept that. I'm almost yours. I wrote a tragedy in verse. Good. where do you live There. My house is not comfortable. It is also called a miserable castle. More misery than castle. Anyway, you're accommodated today. There is also food. We have 20 pieces in the repertoire. All successful. Successful if I play along. Bring her here, Pierre. Drink, Scapin! A delicious marriage of wine. I have to try that. Don't like rabbits? Rabbit is my favorite dish, but... Why don't you take anything? If I eat too much, I put on too much fat. If I'm fat, I lose the character of being thin. But you must eat something. On the fast days. That's how artists are. You can tell everyone's specialty by demeanor and appearance. I advise. Mademoiselle play the lover, right? Naturally. She also plays them in life. Why not? - Yes why not? You have to ask that. - Yes. Are you playing partner? Naturally! All lovers, adventurers and seducers. The joy of all women. The terror of all husbands. But not only on the boards, right? - Yes, I admit it. What is my subject? soubrette Because you always laugh. Should I take men seriously? Some yes, but fools are welcome to confuse you. If I allow him. The salon lady speaks from you. You are a judge of character. From the saloon snake to the weird old woman, she plays everything. One after the other or both at the same time. Only the comedian says that. You have a master's eye, i.e. his ear. August Scapin. At your service. A galley slave. Half juggler, half conjurer. No flattery. Give Master Blasius wine. Ever since the fountain of youth dried up, I hold on to this. Who am I, monsieur? Do you guess that too? You are the youthful naive. And look like a prince's daughter. Now you know our whole squad. I am very happy about this acquaintance. This house heard laughter for the first time in many years. Then why are you staying? If I were you, I wouldn't be bored to death here. With your looks and age I would go to Paris. What am I supposed to do? Make debt. That brings relationships and you become such a big man. Oh! Who still thinks of the Sigognacs at court today? How should I make this trip to Paris? On foot or on horseback? Come with us. Good idea. The last house poet transferred us. You will be the poet of our troupe. Oh, come with me! What am I supposed to do in Paris in these rags? The poorer a poet looks, the better off, people say. That's correct! So what is it, dear Baron? Yes or no? I say maybe I don't know. Stop, Herod! Hey! I've considered your suggestion. Poetry won. But your responsibility if my verses are bad. That is not so important. We usually speak a different text. Adieu, my old Sigognac. Maybe you'll still be standing when I come back. He yawns loudly. We'll be in Riberac soon. Stop! Hands up! No movement! Money or life! No resistance or my people will attack! Here! Come on, you scoundrels! Give fire, people! Attention, baron! You scared our ladies. That's why a fellow like you should be hanged. Go ahead and ask her forgiveness! Dear travellers. Forgive my clumsiness! Show me a little mercy. You're very funny, little boy. As an actor, you stand your ground. This is for you! That's only fair. After all, you robbed me of my honest bread. And the little Chiquita? Mesdames! Should she go empty handed? I promised her a scarf. The chain would look good on me too. You are not very humble. You are good, mademoiselle. I would never kill you. I admired your boldness and courage. You behaved like a hero in a novel. That of a comic novel. Please? Nothing. I thought of Don Quixote and the fight with the windmills. Or rather Captain Fracass and his fight with the scarecrows. He's right. It was just a theater style fight with props. Might be. Except you didn't know. ...punish the good-for-nothing. Making eyes at my daughter and pursuing her virtue. If he were a gentleman with a full bag. But a beggar. Beat him up! If my daughter gets hurt. Then he can also invite me to a glass. Stop! Get out! My beautiful! Offer your hero a hand. Are you not well Thanks, it's alright. You mustn't eat so much. I preach that all the time. diet! And most importantly, get out with harmful juices. Isabelle, I love you. Leondre, my beloved. I swear eternal loyalty to you. Well, baron? How did you like me just now? You were too nice to Leondre. Oh that. That's what it says in the role. Don't be jealous. Take me to the hostel. We were just waiting for you to start the feast. Don't say you're tired. Your beauty belies you. I have to disappoint you. Playing is exhausting. My health is failing. But... To be honest, I don't feel like celebrating either. Excuse me, please. I'd like to play a role you're writing for me. Ever since I've known you, I've felt like writing poetry. But it would have to describe your life. Then it becomes a tragedy. Why tragedy? My birth started badly. Mom, like me, travels the country with a comedy troupe. One evening she was playing at the king's court. One gentleman clapped a lot. I owe my existence to him. Is your father still alive? I don't believe. He went to Flanders with the army and never came back. Mom died very young from grief. Because he wanted to marry her. Do you know him? No, not even the name. Unusual. Didn't your mother leave you anything from him? Just a keepsake. Here, this amethyst. It belonged to my father. You are so sad, Isabelle. I want so much to see you happy. Don't talk about it. Good night Good night, my poet. Oh my head I'm very dizzy. Rest for a moment. Here. So, my dear. Sit down. My foot hurts. I sure screwed him up. I massage him. Excuse me? I'm terribly sensitive. It's getting much better. Your hands? - I'm often told that. Next time I'll sprain my foot first. Not here, monsieur. We're being watched. Then come to my Bruyere Castle. I can't break the contract. Everything can be solved with money. As a nobleman, I am a patron of the fine arts. When will you play for me at Bruyere Castle? - We're wanted everywhere. Name your price! Good. What do you love about theatre? The comedy or the tragedy? The Soubrettes. - You have taste. The Adventures of Captain Matamore. Featuring the greatest and most famous comedian. Do it! Come! Will you well, you scumbags! My poor Matamore. Sorry we're burying you out here. Without a priest and without a bell. But the law disowned us comedians. The law also excommunicated us. Now, here we are again, your audience. That thanks you as its best comedian. We give you our heartfelt final round of applause. Robert. But nobody knew that anymore. Perhaps he had already forgotten it himself. In such cases, the survivors are the ones to mourn the most. Our entire repertoire is endangered by his failure. The performance at the Marquis has burst. We are unlucky. Dear friends! I don't quite know how to put it. I don't want to be pretentious. It's all so difficult. Start shooting! I'm sharing everything with you now. Your bread, the coincidences of the journey and, soon, your success. I could be of use to you now. I don't have Matamore's talent. But with your help, I could try to replace him. She? A Baron de Sigognac? Let's leave the title aside. I feel more like one of yours every day. Leondre said I looked like Captain Fracass. From today, if you want, I'm that famous adventurer. Agreed. Do we have a Captain Fracass as of today. What's up? Why doesn't my beauty appear on the balcony? W aan certain Leandro who has already stolen her heart. Thunder and lightning! Who is this Leandro? Go and get him! I'll smash his nose, carve crosses on his face, quarter him and rip out his guts, burn him and scatter his ashes to the four winds At your service, sir. I see Mr. Leandro coming towards us. Quick, draw your sword, while I'm watching. But wait! Does that mean that Leandro is the one who us coming towards you with your hand on your sword? Yes, sir, at last you will have an equal opponent What, an equal opponent you say? Are you cold, sir, are you shaking? No, I'm shaking with anger. Go towards him, I'll stand by your side. From a lady. — Where is she sitting? In the 1st row, in black. My lord, do you know that I am Captain Matamore from the famous family of Escobom-Bardon, from the Papirontonda? In short, I am descended from Hercules on my mother's side. I don't care if you're from the moon either. Hell and lightning, soon you won't care anymore. Get out, but be quick and I'll spare you Your youth touches me. Look at me closely I am the terror of the universe. Graves open up where I struck believe me I spread such a fear that until now I have only seen the brave from behind. Fine, look me in the face now. Your grave has been dug, you miserable one Han, out my beloved blade, may this foolhardy belly serve as a scabbard for your blade. Oh really? Oh... treacherous blade you are rusty because I'm yours this week didn't deliver the usual ration of carcasses. That's a lesson for me First I want to kill 2 or 3 men before breakfast so that my sword stays clean So so! You too? -Me too! - At what time? At midnight in the Diana's pavilion. And you? At midnight in the Pavilion of Venus. It was a great honor for me to play alongside an Edien like you. This is for the Baron of Sigognac but for our Captain Fracass here is the reward. I would not have dared to hope for such a pleasure. I would rather have earned it with bolder deeds. Ohh... I beg you Leandro stop. Your kisses burn me you drive me crazy Monsieur Herod. You haven't been with us in Poitiers for a long time. We can't change places often enough. Give us the best rooms and of the good wine. I held the wine just for you. I predict a busy winter. Because of the snow? No, because of the women. Aha. Because Corisande is infatuated with you. That's why she's boring. And Artemise. She's like a loyal puppy. It's bland, my dear. I lack one who is cold, heartless, and cruel. Unfortunately, most women want... Lo and behold! The sun rises! A bright sun. It's cloudy now. I like that. Women who flee are vulnerable. I'm getting a taste for love again. Your bath is ready, mademoiselle. Thanks, I don't need you anymore. Come! Here. Hey landlord! Yes, please, monsieur? - You have a maid here. No. I have 3 maids and 4 kitchen boys. I mean the ones from the theatre. - That is possible. I want a room next to hers. Understood? I understand the unsaid best. The prince's room for Monsieur! Master? Count Vallombreuse. Here! Drink to my health. What is that girl that lives with you? Many live here. I mean the ones on the 2nd floor by the 3rd window. A Louidor for every syllable! Then I get three gold pieces: I-sa-belle. Sounds pretty. - She's the naïve. We'll drive that out of her. I mean at the theatre. A false naïve. No, a real one. She has no lover, only an admirer. Whom? A comedian from the troupe. That doesn't count at all. And you? where can I see them They have dress rehearsal with costumes today. Noblemen are admitted. Madame, as always, you come from the left: your daughter is lost. How? What? Monsieur! Your daughter is lost. How come? Because she's in love. - At. My compact, please, Baron. You can fix my ribbons. My beauty patch! "I give you the Order of the Garter. A fool who thinks evil? - I am. You here, marquis? We weren't expecting you. - I comforted the Marquise. Like me, she regretted the departure of the group. Have you replaced me yet? You'll be there in time. No thank you. I look ridiculous I like it. Do you play Sylvia in Scuderi's play, Mademoiselle? I have the honor, monsieur. I envy the poet who entrusts his verses to this mouth. Many men's hearts are sure to fall victim to your beauty today. Children, hurry up! Isabelle! Serafine! You forgot your beauty bandage. Will you graciously allow me to put it on you? No! Mademoiselle can dress up herself. She doesn't need cavaliers like you for that. I await your seconds. Are you foolish A nobleman does not fight with a jester. A whip is good enough for you. Beware, monsieur! I only get spanked on stage. Otherwise I'll share them. You speak to the Comte de Vallombreuse. Let him! I don't beat him up myself. Anyone who touches Pack gets their hands dirty. I leave fellows like that to my lackeys. Everyone on the stage! So monsieur is afraid. What do you allow yourself Who talks with a carnival mask? I'll show my face when it's time, Count! Now I don't want to miss my performance because of you. Asola! Labric! Baasc! Mirandelle! Did you understand me? You shall not kill him. A dog crawls on all fours. Each blow comes from the Comte de Vallombreuse. Go now! He won't enjoy it! He was beside himself with anger. So what? Do you think I don't? Please be reasonable, Philippe! It will be Fracass. And Sigognac? I can not say anything about this. I'll walk you a bit. To handle my affairs alone. You don't have a gun. At least take Matamore's sword. It's just a theatrical sword, but better than nothing. Thank you. Do you really not want me to...? No, Herod! Thanks. Come on! On him! Wait! The boy is mine! Take that from the count! Now speak! By what count? Out with it! From the Count of... It's from the Count! A reminder from... Open your mouth! Speech! By whom? From Vallombreuse. Labric! What's up? What is it, Mirandelle? What happened to you? Lay in wait for him at the inn! “I feel like Hercules. Maybe I hit too hard. I thank you anyway, Herod. I was restless. Did you fight? No. But your skirt is ripped. Better the skirt than the belly. The brave Matamore helped me out with his sword. Vallombreuse will marvel at his lame footmen. I should be mad at you. But one must take you noblemen just as you are. And put up with it. Don't say that! I ask every man to respect you as a woman. Please, Marquis. I like to wait on a kitten from the theater. It's like I'm playing a little comedy myself. In! Uh! Sit and eat with us, Baron. Let's drink to poor Vallombreuse. We watched from the window. As a comedian I am just, but not as a nobleman. What does that mean? I ask you to claim the Count in my name. Are you fighting a count? The nobility of the Sigognacs is ancient. You can even come to church on horseback. do you take care of that? Yes and 1000 times yes. Sword. We'll meet tomorrow at noon. Why doesn't he show his counter saves? That would get Sigognac on the collar. I demand revenge, monsieur. As you wish. But I don't know if I'll spare you then. Swear you'll never fight for me again. I ask you! I cannot swear that oath. You know that. I will punish anyone who insults you. What if he killed you? I think I would have died. Isabelle. I've made a decision, Isabelle. I will be very happy or very unhappy. Everything depends on your answer. What do you want to ask me? Do you want to be my wife? Become your wife? Yes! My wife before God and man. Say yes, Isabelle! Give me some time To think of such things. ” Do you understand that I don't know what to answer? You want to marry me. In the chapel of my old castle. There are only a few rafters left of the roof, but what does that matter? We don't have to get married in the rain, do we? You gave me the illusion of being your wife for a minute. Now I want to answer. No, Philippe. I will never marry you. Why not? Because I love her. Have to think about the future. You need a woman to help you become that. what you were. Not an actress your friends would despise. Who dares, I force before my sword. That's exactly what I don't want. Isabelle! No. They promised that I can be free. Also a promise. Belong to another man. I was your wife for a moment. For a short dream. This memory must last my whole life. To tomorrow. dearest Poor Sigognac. It is to be crazy. I wouldn't love her now and she didn't love me. Then I would have held her back and put my arms around her. Love is actually not that difficult. You just can't love. This is the baron's room. Maybe where the light just went out. should I try - Yes. Shh! Do not Cry! I figured I'd find you here. Someone sent you. I come to warn you I should sneak in and open the door for them. They want to kidnap you Who? you know the man He lives in the castle nearby. Agostin, who received money from the count, is waiting below. Poor Agostine. The first time I betray him. What are you trying to tell him? That you were still awake or someone was in the room with you. Beware of the count. He's crazy about you He lets things jump. Look here! All in solid gold. Agostin has twice as much. But you! You gave me the chain back then. I'll never forget you. Now I'll give you something too. Here, the knife. Do you see? All you have to do is press the button and strike. As great as you can! That's good protection if he harasses you again. Farewell! And don't forget Chiquita! Who's there? Isabelle! Yes? There are men on the street down there. Check it out! I? Actually. They want to kidnap me. They come from Count Vallombreuse. Again those thieves. Open up! Open up! The bucket! Whoo! Hey! Away quickly! Say nothing Fracass. Otherwise he will fight again. Disappear. - You're right. Lay down. Tomorrow we go to Paris. Fragrant thyme. Buy the goods! Wonderful fish, monsieur. No. Dewy goods! Everything sold today. - What, all gone already? A small gift. Wonderful way Almost without pain. Mesdames and messieurs. Come closer! This is the miraculous elixir of the great Genghis Khan. The great Genghis Khan of India passed down the elixir only to me. I'll save your teeth when you're in pain! No more cardboard roast chickens. From now on we eat real pheasants on stage. Great. Who delivers them? Prince de Moussy. Do not turn around. I'm being watched. I know the Visage, but I don't know where from. 2 drops instilled on the diseased tooth... Definitely a pickpocket. Is the prince a philanthropist? In fact, he is His Majesty's General Manager. We play in a royal troupe. We'll soon be presented at court, we'll have our own carriages... Be careful! Must be drunk. I consider him sober. What does that mean? He wanted to run you over. Unfortunately, I did not recognize the coat of arms. I eat a nut with its shell, Vallombreuse is definitely behind it. No nobleman is so cowardly. Not all nobles are like you. Excluded. The Count is wounded. That was just a scratch. Just watch out, captain! Vallombreuse wants to get at you. But we need you more. For Isabelle. For this bungling I gave the coachman 20 Louidor. You are responsible, not the driver! The baron will be finished by tomorrow. Otherwise I'll send you back to the galley. In other words, my dear friends. There is a bright new star in our squad named Fortuna. I would touch wood. No, I'm touching gold. Because gold is a symbol of good luck. To the end of the famine years! New happy time! Do you have a bed for me To the women! - Yes. Why are you so quiet when everyone else is happy? You know my happiness doesn't depend on fame, it depends on you. In three months we'll be the most famous squad in the world. But now that's enough. It's already late. We're going to bed. Are you still staying? - But only for the last glass. Ah, I'm just getting started. For the benefit! I advise you to lock your door well tonight. Don't open up to anyone, Isabelle! Why? What are you afraid of? I have the impression that Paris is more dangerous at night than Poitiers. No fear! I will barricade myself. Sleep well Isabelle! What does this mean? Shh! Wait you dog! Shh! Who are you? Mirandelle. Who is your lord Are you going to shut up, you rascal? Is it Vallombreuse, huh? Yes. Watch out, you scoundrel! Tell your master that his methods disgust me. If he doesn't have enough, I'm happy to duel again. I'll send you to hell if I see your gangster face again. Hey Lampourde! To hell! Don't disturb me now! Wait a minute, Mirandelle! They undressed me right away. And the! What did I say? Money only worries. That you only get enough! Now to us, my son! What is? I want to propose you a business. Alright. But I'll tell you one thing: Don't come back with stealing. This is boring. I want to see blood You should too. Then he has to defend himself. Otherwise it's no fun. No worries. He's a tough nut. Who? Who is standing in your way? His name is Fracass and he's in an acting company. He knows me now. It's hard for me to get to him, so I thought of you. Gentlemen! The little black dress doesn't look bad. Quiet! It's good. The guy is skilled. - That's how you kill someone without making a sound. She can come to me every night. She has fire in her blood. Not bad, right? My lord only pays in advance. There's your reward. The troupe plays at the Hotel de Bourgogne. Do it on the way there. Enough, enough. Order a fair now! Hey! Come here sweety Let the wine rain down! Two mugs, monsieur? 20! The gold must roll. Come here, rascals! Lampourde pays for everything. I want to see Isabelle the comedian. Very well, sir. I want to surprise her. You are here? Sorry for the surprise visit. Perhaps I should have asked for an audience like a queen. But I was afraid you'd refuse me entry. Leave the courtly phrases, Count. I'm a simple comedian. You're wasting your time with me. My time is yours alone. How my whole life is dedicated to you. I am your slave forever. A slave that belongs only to you. I chose my slavery myself, with no strings attached. Slavery takes two. The slave and his master. Or mistress. Exactly. But I am not your mistress and never will be. I regret being so plain. Do you have so little experience with women that you don't feel it? Your boldness amuses me, knowing why. Then respect him too. This reason could quickly disappear. At the moment I envy Sigognac. But I'll pity him tomorrow. What does that mean? I had a strange dream last night. About what? Sigognac would be the victim of a fatal accident or a nasty encounter. Paris streets are very unsafe at night. You are a brute! You're exaggerating, madam! 'Cause I hate shedding blood when I don't have to. In this case it seems to me quite superfluous. Because it only costs you one word to save him. The tiny word "yes". Monsieur de Sigognac is in danger? It looks like this. About tonight? Its possible. You can play fate for him. I offer you an exchange. Sigognac's life versus a few hours of your life. No, monsieur. I'm not asking very much of you. Just one night. Tonight only. A car will pick you up at midnight. At daybreak your wish will be granted. Then you don't have to fear for his life anymore. The life of the one you think you still love. Go out! If I go, skip Sigognac too. And you, monsieur, are doing without Isabelle! Because if an accident separates him from me, I won't survive Philippe a day. What a role. But they don't do theatre. Life looks Ordinary The good Sigognac will disappear. Now it's up to you. Is he disappearing from life or just from your heart? I begrudge him his life. Being patient, I don't rush you and wait for your answer. Let's say an hour. Leave me now! This is my last word! All the worse for him, Isabelle! Thats how you wanted it! You parry well, monsieur. You have principles. And I use them. I notice that. Parry that! Wonderful. We'll have lots of fun. Thunderstorm, monsieur! Your style is admirable. You are very kind. My compliment. In all fairness I would be finished now. I don't mean to be indiscreet, but who was your teacher? Giolago? No. Arricantes? Neither. Then Cotassier? No. There is no one but him. I learned from an old soldier who served under my father. Parry that! His favorite save. Damn it! There is no cure for such attacks. Now it's my turn. You will make eyes. Method against method! Mine is the high school of edien weapon craftsmanship. It took me 7 years to learn this art. So far no one has survived. Before you die, get some rest. Then catch your breath. If you parry that punch, I'll teach you that. That's the only gift I can give you. But it is princely and you are worthy of it. And now commend your soul to those who deserve it. So! En garde! No! If you don't have the rest of my sword in your body, you're a god. So I'm big-hearted too. I could pierce you But I don't do it because I like you. Captain Fracass! From now on, consider me your slave. I was forced to kill you and I took the money. But I give it back. And if I had to steal it! What did I say I am your slave, your dog, your hunting dog, your guard dog. As they want. You whistle and I'm there. Reports! Did your husband do the job? You will be satisfied. He wields a good blade. Pardon me, Count! There is a man... This is Lampourde. Exactly at the moment. Lead him in! What does this comedy mean? For the first time in my life I was unable to fulfill a contract. Since I'm honest in my craft, I'll bring the money back. Again, nothing but bragging. He's a coward. I promoted 30 people to the afterlife. Nobody has ever seen me from behind in a fight. I offered Fracass my best blade. And? That was left. Killing this man is beyond my strength. So please don't count on me anymore. I could have kept the money because of the risk. But my conscience is tender. Keep the pouch and drink to my health. Thank you, Highness! I am now retiring from the tiresome Fracass affair. If you like, my other self will continue. The Chevalier Malartic. He deserves your absolute trust. At your service, monsignor. I hinted at your second project. He has an almost infallible plan to kidnap your comedienne. I'm not taking up the Count's time any longer. What is this plan? Tomorrow the Italians and Herod's troupe will play before the king. Oh! Oh miserable! You compromised this woman. - That demands satisfaction. I will do as you wish. The choice is yours. Either you marry her and we turn a blind eye. Or you refuse. Then we'll send you to hell. Then I'd rather choose the wedding. In my arms, beloved. No! Just not that! Please don't! But. Moussy! Sir? I like the people. I want to compliment you. Very well! Help! The prince is being robbed! Help! Thieves! Help! Help! Murderer! Help! guards! Fast! Fast! Guards! Thieves! Murderer! Catch them! Catch the woman! Catch her! Don't let them escape! Wait a minute, you cat! Monsieur! Monsieur! He killed old Picard. Quickly send a messenger to my father! I am very grateful to the Queen for bringing you to Paris. I owe it to your troops that I forgot my worries the whole evening. You will receive my royal thanks. My friends, I also admire your way of playing comedy. Forgive my indiscretion. But your eyes! Her face! It reminds me of another one that was very dear to me. What's your name? My name is Isabelle, monsignor. I know. But what next? I don't have another name. Picard was just murdered. You have a keen sense of caricature. There is a deep truth in your exaggerations. Congratulations! I beg Your Majesty's permission to retire. I received the message that my son urgently wants to see me. Go easy, Moussy. He accompanies us to the Louvre. I am very saddened, my father. I loved him. I weep for him like a brother. I mourn him with you, son. I feel like my whole childhood went away with him. How often did I run to him as a child with my worries. He was the confidante of my youth. I know my son. I was often very jealous because of your attachment to him. I thought he was closer to you than me. I was intimidated by you. That's still the case today, father. This is painful. Maybe that's why I misjudged you all my life, my son. I thought you had no heart. Really. You sometimes give that impression. Perhaps your indulgence made life too easy for me. This may be. But I am happy, despite this painful incident. Through him I realized how your real being is. I am the steward of the Count of Pomerol. - What can I serve? My lord would like to invite your troupe to entertain his guests. His castle is about an hour from here. My lord is a nobleman who does not waste money. You can ask for a good price. I would like to please your master. But we already play here four times a week. - One day is enough. If you accept the offer, this 100 Louidor is the down payment. Your master is a great art lover. I can't refuse him anything. We'll be there the day after tomorrow. Where is the palace? On the way to Cheuvreux. A servant awaits you at the crossroads of the four hinds. Either we are there too early or our husband is late. Uh! I love the forest I spent the best time of my life in the woods. We met each other for the first time in a forest too, Isabelle. I remember leaves caught in your hair. And you were wearing a blue dress. Have pity on a blind man who lost his sight in war. YOU were a soldier? Take. Help! Philip! Philip! Help! Isabelle! Help Philip! Philip! Help Philip! Philip! No! I do not want! Let me go No! Now Vallombreuse has succeeded. I will find Isabelle again! Hello! Where is Pomereux Castle? What? - Pomereux Castle. Don't shout like that. I'm not deaf! There are as many Pomereux here as cherries on a rose bush. What did I say? The whole thing was a trap. Then back to Paris! That's the only place where we'll find Vallombreuse. Not so full! Me too! Bottom up! Who's drinking with me to the crooks? Who drinks with me to the women? Let's drink to our guild. Do you still have my knife Naturally. Grind it well on the soles of the shoes! Why is that, Chiquita? For all cases. If you want to defend yourself, you need weapons. How do you get here I smuggled myself in here. The dogs grabbed my Agostin. But nothing should happen to you. Where am I? By the gentleman for whom I was to kidnap you in Poitiers. In his father's castle. At Vallombreuse? Yes, with him. You don't like him, do you? I know you would like to escape from him. I'm alone. There's nobody here who could get you out. But I can tell your friend where you are. Would you do that? For you yes. But how do you get out? Do not worry, I'm going to make it. Well, then run to the hotel and show this ring to Captain Fracass. Then he knows that you come from me. As soon as day breaks, I'll be with him. When you come back, you can wish whatever you want. I don't want anything from you. But. Give me a kiss. Nobody has ever liked me. Watch out! Couldn't we both escape together? You would fall in the process. Now you need to cut the rope. Adieu! I am puzzled. Vallombreuse was with the king all day yesterday. Tonight he was in Saint-Germain to play. The alibi is good. What are you doing here? You have to free her. Where? In the Vallombreuse Castle. Caution! The little one must be from the gang. Do you know this ring It belongs to Isabelle. Get the horses! you guide us As in love as the baron is, it's devilish fun. Water! Fresh water! There he comes! A murderer! Kill him! He shall die, the dog! Fie, the gypsy! Up with him! Good this way! Bind him! You should die! I want to hear you whine, you dog! He must die! Cut off his hands! You murderer, you! Hey! Place! place there! Place! Place! Agostine! Chiquita, where are you going? Away girl! Otherwise I'll break all your bones. I love you! She killed him. She's in league with him! That whore! There's nothing more we can do for them. Terrible. We found this necklace and this ring on her. We assume the jewelry is yours, monsignor. No! - She may be right about the necklace. The ring is mine. He wears my coat of arms. Did you steal it from here? I didn't steal it. A lady gave it to me. - Who? I don't know it. I expected. She gave it to me at Vallombreuse Castle. Do not lie! Vallombreuse is uninhabited at this time of the year. You are wrong! The gentleman who hired us to do this kidnapped her. He keeps her captive there. - Further. They do not believe me? Not a word. - That's very stupid. Captain Fracass believed me at once. He saw the ring and immediately rode off. Does Fracass know the mysterious lady? Naturally. He plays theater with her. Isabelle? Did he really kidnap her? Pass me the small cassette, please. You know, the Small Jewel Case. Come closer! I know now that you spoke the truth, my child. Take your chain back But I'd rather bring the ring back to its owner myself. Thank you. Take her away! My car! I need him now! Now I don't understand anything at all, monsignor. I gave the ring to a comedian named Cornelia a long time ago. She was once my great love. I wore the same ring for years. When we were apart, we wrote to each other. With the ring we sealed our letters. If this Isabelle is Cornelia's biological daughter... Would she also be your daughter and Vallombreuse's sister. Let's hurry, chevalier. Heaven have mercy we're not late. I had to do without your enchanting sight for a whole day. I hope your hatred for me has increased. Impotent hate is a spicy spice, Isabelle. Tell me you hate me! That you despise me Don't want to speak? Your silence betrays your true feelings all the more. Bravo! Just fight back! Your defeat is all the more appealing to me. You disgusting little rascal! You have spoken! My first win! It's wonderful how you resist. It's useless. You will be mine and the whole world will know. You are so adorable in your desperation. I love you. Let me go! Don't come near me or... you are gorgeous The more you hate me, the more beautiful you become. Take care! Strike, my heart! Strike, my beauty! Even if you still resist. You will be mine me alone Alarm! Go now! - Fast! Philip! Here I am! Philip! Philip! Philip! Help me Philippe! Come with me! Philippe, save me! Up! Fast! No! Not! Come on! In there! Hello, here I am now. Wait, my boy! Now you get a crown put on. I warned you, curs! If I meet you again, I'll kill you! I keep my word! Philip! Help Philip! Help! That's not how you do it. Wait! Watch out! Philip! Danger! Down there! There are two We'll buy it. Sapperlot! That went wrong. But you are a bungler. I'm fat enough. Here! Parry that! Give me one touche! Hurry into the boat, Herod! Ah, look! Monsieur de Lampourde. Exactly. And what do I see? Monsieur de Malartic. It seems to me that monsieur changed precincts. Yes, but that shouldn't stop you from honestly earning your living. Help! Philip! Spare me! I beg you! Philip! Save me Philippe! Take her with you! I'll take care of the rest myself. No! No! Philip! I'm done, comrade. Give me time to cross myself. That's the way it is in our trade. Now that I'm almost dead, what are you going to do with me, mate? I allow you to continue to participate in the battle. As a spectator! That was skillful. Not bad at all, the Count. A little cramped. - But he's taking risks. The theory is good, but the practice is completely lacking. I bet 20 Louidor on the Count. Do you have it? - Not yet, but I win them from you. Make no mistake! We must intervene. Let her! There you see how lovers fight. Are you gonna stop now Hey! stop! Monsieur! fight as you should! Isabelle! Isabelle! Isabelle, dear heart! You are saved Philip! Monsieur! I know why you broke into my castle. And by force of arms. I can't even be angry with you. Because violence provokes violence and justifies it. But as for you: You knew exactly what a bad thing you represent. Get out now! Are you hurt, mademoiselle? No. Please say, my child: does this ring belong to you? Yes, monsignor. Who did you get it from? From my mother Cornelia. Then my intuition did not deceive me, monsieur. There are still miracles. Yes. There are miracles, Isabelle. Your mother and I once loved each other very much, many years ago. There is no longer any doubt that you are my daughter. I let you search for 20 years. Everywhere. But in vain. Until finally today a lead appeared through my son. He's my second child and not worthy of my name. Yes I am talking about you Unfortunately, I have to speak as you deserve. So far I've forgiven you for all the pranks, great as they were. But there is no excuse for that. It's an outright crime. Do you know who that girl is that you had kidnapped? The daughter of the woman I told you about once. She is my daughter. If that's true, she can take my place with you. What does that mean? what about you Nothing father. It's coming to an end. Fast! Ride after a doctor! And you, don't stand around! Take him to his room! Farewell, Isabelle. Are you leaving? Why then? I killed your brother, Isabelle. But I don't feel guilty because it was an honest fight. He threw himself on my sword. Otherwise I would have given him life this time too. However, I have to do without you. In your father's eyes, I will always be a murderer. Philip! I love her. And I will always love you. You mustn't go away and leave me alone, Philippe. The wound is deep, but the lungs appear unharmed. I hope we can save him. What is? - He will live. We old warhorses always know more about this than the pharmacists. What are you doing now? I'm writing a play about it. The text is almost ready. I'll write it down and distribute the roles. I play the old de Moussy. - I play Isabelle. Wonderful! By the resemblance. You are Sigognac and you are Vallombreuse. Do I have to learn lines to die? No, but the silent roles are the most difficult. Complete? In my arms, my poor child. Your dear brother is saved. Oh, you my, you my blondhead. We must say goodbye. You want to go? Never. That would be terrible. As a poor comedienne, I could have married you. The ruin of my family now forbids me to take a rich wife. Dying is boring. Do not bother! - Dead people always bother. Father! Just be... It's not a crime that I inherit a lot of money. The main thing is that he is noble. Calm down, blondhead. I know the Sigognacs. Her nobility predates Moussy's. I have no doubt that the king... King. - Who else? The king will respect you. My dear father - Come here! Be happy my children. You dear, dear! Oh yes. My blond happiness. But now I have to step in and move the honored viewers to tears. Too late my boy. The scene ends on the real stage. Once upon a time there was an old, ruined castle. They called it the Castle of Misery. Now it will be the castle of our happiness.
