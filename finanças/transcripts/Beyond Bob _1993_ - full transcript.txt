(smooth music) (birds singing) (playful music) (phone ringing) - [Isaac] Hi, this is Isaac, you know how this works. Leave your name and a short phone number at the tone, I'll get right back to you. (phone beeps) - [Tracy] Hi, Isaac, this is Tracy. I know it's been too long, I'm sorry. Look, this is ridiculously short notice, what else is new? This weekend, my parents' place, just like old times. Can you come up? I hope I hear from you. Can't wait to see you, bye.

(they laugh) Oh, oh you look good. - Thanks. You look great. - Thanks. Hey, you've got a gray hair. - No! - Yes, you do! - Ah! - See, look. - Well, at least it was still hanging in there. Wait a minute. You're turning gray yourself! - No. - Yeah, a little bit right there, look! - Come on, I want you to meet Neal. Honey, did you get something? - Well, I was trying for a squirrel, but I really don't know the right way to prepare 'em. - I think you just yell, Look out, I'm gonna shoot. (they laugh) - You must be Isaac. Hi, Neal Kennedy. - Hi, Neal. - Isaac, I hope you don't mind, but I told Neal you'd play him some of your stuff this weekend. - What stuff? - Well, I remember some songs I think would be great for the next album. - [Isaac] You have got a hell of a memory. - I'd love to hear him. - All right, I gotta warn you, they're all about 12 years old. - Oh, that's all right, so are most of Tracy's fans. We'll talk a little more after dinner. Speaking of which, I'd better get going. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Neal. Wow. Cooks, he hunts, he dresses well. Is there anything he doesn't do? - Macrame, but I'm working on it. (Isaac laughs) - You know, I just read a great article about you. Where was that? - [Tracy] Ah, well there was the cover of Stone and Newsweek- - No, no, no, no. It was that thing about the alien space diet that you and Big Foot's love child came up with. - [Tracy] Yeah, another excellent article. - [Isaac] Pithy. (Tracy laughs) - The last album was a snap. The critics were polite and it's selling by the truckload. It's the next one, the one after the gold record that's the bitch. - Hun? - Ah, that's parsley, hun. I need basil. - So what exactly do you do, Neal? - Well, officially I'm Tracy's manager, but I guess you could also call me her producer, mentor, father confessor- - Sage? - Oh, I wouldn't go that far. - No silly, sage. Could use this instead of basil. - Well, yeah, a pinch. I'll also need four hard boiled eggs. - Hard boiled eggs coming up. - So what do you do when you're not writing songs, Isaac? - Well, that's most of the time. Actually, I'm a newspaper writer. I'm the music critic. - Another critic, uh-oh. - So how'd you review my album? - I think I'm too close to be objective. - Hey, nothing wrong with a bias press. As long as it's in our favor. Listen, you decide you ever want to go national, I know a couple of guys at Rolling Stone who owe me favors. - Well thanks, Neal. - What's keeping those eggs? - I can't remember which ones I hard-boiled. - Tracy. - Well, I forgot. - Anyway, I think it's great that there's at least one critic out there with a background in music. - Here, watch this. Hard boiled eggs spin, uncooked ones don't. I used to be the food critic. (car horn beeping) - Oh, they're here. Two more places. - I didn't realize Tracy invited anybody else this weekend. I mean, besides me. Oh, and you of course. - Didn't she tell you? She invited the whole band. - What band? - Your band? - My band? - Well, Bob's band. (they scream and laugh) - Oh, it's so good to see you! How was the drive up? - Great. I cut my best time by 40 minutes. - Yeah, Augie still insists that nationally imposed speed limits are unconstitutional. - Yeah. - Hey, Thomas Jefferson would've screamed his ass off. - Yeah, I remember the Fargo road trip. You tried that same argument with the highway patrol. - And he wouldn't let us go above (mumbles). - That was Bob's moaning phase. Do you remember when he repositioned the telescope in the astronomy department? - I'll give them a lunar eclipse they'll never forget. Or something like that, right? - That's pretty close. - Who's the dick in the apron? - Everyone, this is Neal Kennedy, Neal, this is Augie Glass, one of the world's greatest drummers. - One of the world's greatest undiscovered drummers. (they laugh) - And Kris Sherwood, photographer extraordinaire. - Currently road manager extraordinaire. At least until Augie can find somebody full time. (they laugh) - Well, this is so great having everyone here. - Aren't we missing somebody? There's another woman, right? - Oh right, Ginny. - You tracked down Ginny? God, I thought she dropped off the face of the Earth. - No, no, no, I found her album, remember this? - Oh, no! - God's believers still sending her residuals. - Look at her hair! - Oh, Neal, remember what I said about watching your language around- - Oh, Jesus, that's right. No swearing around the Minister's dogs. I suppose you're gonna lock up the liquor too. - On the contrary, what can I get everybody? - Did you tell your parents we're coming this weekend, or did you lie? (they laugh) - God, they used to scream at me. Who made this mess? Who drank all the liquor? Who put the lawn furniture up on the roof? (they laugh) - Bob did it. - Bob did it! - That's what I always said. - Actually... Actually, I persuaded Tracy to buy the house from her parents as an investment. Now they lease it back from her for a couple of weeks every summer. - But you give them a break on the rent, right? - No. - I wanted to, but Neal says I can't. Tax reasons. Neal's a wizard with money. - Especially other people's money. (he chuckles) (smooth rock music) (car engine revs) (wheels screeching) - Remember when I told you I'd have a house like this by the time I was 30? - Yeah. - Guess I'm running a little late. So, does this weekend thing involve food, or are we on our own, or? - Well, dinner's almost ready. We're just waiting for- Ginny? - Oh, there you are! Jesus, what the hell happened to all of you? So, after I broke up with that jerk, I got involved in this pro-nuclear anti-abortion thing. No, wait, reverse that. And I moved in with this woman, a lesbian it turns out, and we had been going for a while, but it just didn't work out. She's a vegetarian, I just can't get into that. God made cows to eat, you know? Every living thing that moves on earth shall be food for you, Genesis 9:3. So, I hit the road again. - Neal? Neal, honey, could you give me a hand in the kitchen? - Oh yeah, sure, excuse us. Talk about your lost sheep. - Oh, Neal, I wish you could have met her before. She used to be so, well, just so- - Well, that's the record biz. It does change people. - Anyway, so there we were, 20 days outside of Nepal, and all of a sudden, out of the blue, comes this little man in a robe. Turns out he's a monk. The locals call him the Shama Lama. - The Shama Lama? - Uh-huh. - Shama lama ding dong. He was big back in the fifties. - Would you be quiet a minute? - Who, me or her? - Both of you. Listen, I've been thinking, why do you suppose Tracy called us all back together again after all these years? Think about it. - She's planning to kill us one by one. (he laughs maniacally) - Look around, we're all here. Drums, backup vocals, keyboards. I'll bet she's planning on putting the band back together again. - I don't understand. Why would she want to kill us then? - Ginny, come on. That guy Neal is a record producer and her manager. Now, if you had Tracy's money and clout, would you want to work with your friends? - But what makes Tracy think we'd just drop everything and run off with her? I mean, I would, of course. - I don't think I'm ready to get back into that kind of grind. - Well, of course you are, Ginny. It'll be great for Augie too. - Yeah, maybe, but I like what I'm doing. - You like driving hundreds of miles a day, living on cold, greasy takeout food, sleeping in filthy motels and playing to a bunch of drunken backwater yokels? - Oh sure, just talk about the negative stuff. - All right. Here we are. Now, as a special after dinner treat, I've brought out one of my favorites. This is a delightful Venezuelan liquor. Believe me, after a long day in the jungles, there's nothing finer. - Yeah, those Venezuelans really know how to live. (they laugh) - Well, this is so great having you all here at once. I'd like to propose a toast to old friends. - Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. - I was gonna save this till later, but I just can't wait. There's a special reason why I asked you all up here this weekend. Neal, do you want to tell them or should I, or? - Oh no, I think it would mean more coming from you. - Isaac, Ginny, Augie and Kris. I've known you all since, well for a long time. And you are all so dear to me, it would give me and Neal great pleasure if on Sunday you would be our witnesses as we exchange our wedding vows. - Marriage kind of wedding vows? - Just like. (gentle piano music) So I figured if word of the wedding were to leak out to all those supermarket scandal sheets, you know, they'd swarm up here and just ruin everything. - It is a bitch being famous. Well, it has been for me. (they laugh) - Sorry. So when are you guys getting married? - Oh. - I sound like your Mother! - No, I think my Mother's given up on me. I told her at this point, if she wants Augie in the family, she'd be better off adopting him. (she laughs) - So, it's really just a question of targeting the audience. Those little buggers don't have much money, but what they do have, they spend on CDs, tapes and records, God bless 'em. - How do you like the record? - Oh, it's selling very well. - No, he means the music. How'd you like the music? - I'm not the target audience. Hey hun, why don't we show them the video? Oh, granted, they're a little out of the A train, but they still might get a kick out of it. - You guys don't want to see my video, do you? - No. (they laugh) - Oh, sure they do. I directed it.

Are you in love? - [Isaac] No. (she laughs) - You know what you are? - An idiot? - No. You are living proof that all the best men are not taken. - Well, maybe that's because the best women are. - Are you currently recording with anyone? - Haven't for years. - Oh, we should talk about that. - Crap, crap, garbage, crap. - Look at Tracy. My God, she languished for years, what with bad material, bad management, bad hair. You know, I turned her entire career around with one album, or actually to tell the truth, with one single, off an otherwise (mumbles) album. - Crap, crap, crap. - I don't know, I just started to get control of my life. - Oh, don't worry about that. That's what I do best. - So out. - I don't know, it's, Neal's kind of, it's hard to explain. You know, I think, I think he's like Bob would have been, if he'd had a chance to grow up. - Yeah? Well, growing up's not all it's cracked up to be. - So, you're not writing songs, huh? - No, not much. Oh, well that's not true. Not at all. - Well, how come? - I don't know. - [Tracy] You're so good. - I lack inspiration, I guess. - Ah, Tracy, I am going to how you say, hit the hay. I do not suppose you would care to join me? - Sure, hun. Your room's all set, I'll see you in the morning. - Thanks. Good night. (wind chime tinkling) (upbeat piano music) - Hey, join in any time. (Isaac screams) - Bob? - Isaac. - Bob? - Isaac. - Bob? - Isaac, this is getting boring. - What are you doing here? - I'll tell you what I'm doing here if you tell me why we're whispering. (Isaac stuttering) Come on, say the D word. - Dead? - Ya-hah, I sure am! Doesn't mean you have to whisper on me. Come on, loosen up. (he cheers) It's Friday night, we got no more classes, let's party our asses! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. The others are sleeping. - Well, they can't hear me. You can't hear me, can you? See. You're an educated man, you should know this. Only you can see me, only you can hear me. Aren't you lucky? - Is this a dream? - Well, I'm flattered you consider dreaming about me, but no, you're awake, I'm dead, deal with it. - What are you doing here? - I am the undead, I come from beyond the grave to claim that which is mine. - Oh my God! - I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Whew. You look terrible, let's get you a drink. (tense music) Tracy's folks always hid the good stuff. I'd join you, but since I am no longer of the flesh, this stuff will all wind up on the floor. Go ahead, have a snort. (tense music) If you say Bob one more time, I'll smack you. - Sorry. I am having a little trouble handling this. I don't believe in ghosts. - Hey, me neither. So, how have you been? - Me? - Yeah. I'm dead, things are pretty much the same with me. How about you? Are you happy? - Am I happy you're dead? - [Bob] No, dummy, are you happy with your life? - What if I say no? - Relax, will you? I'm visiting, I'm not recruiting. Wait, wait, wait, who is this bozo? - [Isaac] He's her manager, producer, Svengali. - Tracy's marrying an Italian guy? Well, when did the two of you break up? - Us? We never dated. - Get out of here, you used to be so hot for her! - I was not. - Yes, you were! - No, I wasn't! - Don't argue with me, I know where your ancestors are. Now come on, tell me the truth. When Tracy and I were going hot and heavy, in the back of your mind, wasn't a little voice saying, Gee, I wish something would happen to Bob. - Don't be ridiculous. - If Bob was out of the way, Tracy would surely fall for me. Come on, am I right? - Bob, you're my best friend. - And you're my best friend, don't change the subject. Come on, am I right? - All right, yeah. Yes, I have to admit it, the thought crossed my mind. Once. - Bull. - Maybe twice. - Double bull! - All right, all right, I wanted you out of the way! - Well you got your wish, schmuck, and you blew it. Jeez, you step out for 10 years and everything goes to hell. - You know, speaking of hell- - Watch it. - No, no, no, no. I was just wondering if you, well, if you went, or... - Thanks a lot! - What do you mean? You made it to heaven? - Well, actually I was as surprised as you are. You know, the weird thing is, it doesn't matter how good you were. It's all based on your SATs. (Isaac laughs) - Get out of here. - You have to understand how it's set up. I mean, it's not like up in the clouds or anything like that. It's here. It's right here, all around us. You just can't see it. - You mean, you mean like a parallel dimension or something? - Yeah, kind of, only more. Whatever existed on Earth, exists in heaven. This house, that lake, our old grade school. - Our school burned down. - It's still in heaven. - Well, they built a shopping center over it. - That's there too. - How? - I don't know how, it just is. Hell, Einstein is there, even he can't explain it. - Einstein? You've met him? - Everybody is there. All the people you read about, it's a mindblower. - What about Hitler? You mean there isn't any hell? - Yeah, sure, but it's in heaven. - I don't follow you. - Look, look, in heaven, you can do anything you want to do, anything. And right now in heaven, there are about 30 million people who want nothing more than to kick Hitler right in the nuts. I mean, you want to know what hell is? It's being kicked in the nuts 30 million times a day for eternity. (gentle music) Does she miss me? I mean, does she ever mention me? - I thought you guys could listen to that sort of stuff. - Oh, sure, and we do at first. And then as time goes on, you tune in every once in a while. And if you don't hear your name being mentioned, you begin to wonder. - Yeah, well, don't worry about it. We all miss you. Everybody still talks about you. I mean, that is about all we've done all night. - How long has it been since you've all been together? - [Isaac] I don't know. Eight, 10 years. - 10 years? Either I'm dead or my watch has stopped. - You know, Tracy should not be marrying that guy. He's, I don't know, he's not right for her. - Oh, and you are? Tracy likes you. She thought it was real cute the way you wrote that song for her. What was the name of that stupid thing? - The last song that I wrote for you. (he laughs) ♪ You cannot rush these things along ♪ ♪ You know it would be wrong ♪ ♪ Two microwave a song ♪ You should have told her how you felt. - Now you tell me. And what would she say? - Isaac? Isaac? Hey, are you up? - Oh, God. Ooh, I had the strangest dream last night. - Really, that's wild, so did I. What was yours about? - It's about a quarter scotch, I think. - Right. You're the last one up, get in the shower, I got a big day planned. (bright piano music) - Here you go. - Thanks. (Isaac shouts) - Are you all right in there? - Yeah, the water suddenly got cold. - Well, last one up gets the cold water. - Oh my God, it wasn't a dream. - Sure it was, and this is a wet dream. Listen, I got a great idea. - That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. - Oh look, you know you should marry Tracy, and I know you should marry Tracy. All we got to do now is convince Tracy. - Oh, the day before her wedding? - Hey, is it my fault you took 10 years to get off your butt? - Do you think Tracy ought to have a say in all this? - Ah, it's out of her hands. This is divine intervention. Now put on your pants. - Why did you spin the egg? - To see if it was hard-boiled or not. Little trick I developed. (the girls giggle) - What are you guys doing? - Neal's teaching us how to make hollandaise sauce. - It doesn't have raisins in it, does it? - Hollandaise, good God, no. - Good, raisins make me fart. - Ew. - Anybody still hungry? - Morning, everyone. - Hey, Isaac. - Hey. - Wow, what happened to your aura? - My aura? - Yeah. My spiritualist said I'm the best energy spotter he'd ever seen, ever. And I've been picking up some mighty powerful vibrations ever since I got here. - Does anybody else notice anything unusual about me or my immediate aura? - You look hung over. - Thanks, Kris. - Wait a hot second, that's Ginny. - Mm-hmm. - Talk about raising the dead, wa! - Pulp? - Freshly squeezed. - Okay. - Hey, how's it coming? - Ah, well, you can't rush perfection, as you learnt last night, mon cher. - So that's the dickhead, huh? - Yeah. - What? - Oh, I just said yep, you can not rush perfection. - Come here, you little froggie delight. (they giggle) - Oh, come on! Ever seen a ghost throw up? I'll bet this clown buttons his pajamas all the way up to the neck. (blender whirring) - Sweetie, sweetie. - Oh, sorry. - Careful. Honey, what did you do? Ah! Oh, oh, sweetie! Oh, oh, it's all over everything. Oh! - House is possessed. Quick, call the police. - Look at me, I'm soaked! - Oh, it's no big deal all right! Change your shirt. Hey, you guys will never guess what I have planned for later today. - Oh, let me guess. We're gonna eviscerate your fiance. - God, what's eviscerate mean? - To disembowel, take out the entrails. Why? - Oh, I was just working on some lyrics, before. Is there coffee? - Isaac, you seem kinda hazy this morning. - Yeah, yeah, sometimes takes me a while to wake up. - You should meditate. I got up at five and did three hours worth. I like to meditate in the nude. - Why the hell wasn't I in her shower this morning? - It works great. Sometimes I levitate. - Oh bullshit, I can't even do that. - So what exactly did you have planned for this morning? - Oh, you'll never guess. - Roller skating. - Roller skating? - That's incredible, how did you know that? - Oh... (he chuckles) Little dead bird told me. - Wow, well, we'll go right after we eat, I've got it all planned. Oh, this is gonna be fun, trust me. (upbeat music) - Okay, okay, have you got any without pompoms? (she laughs) - So, Ginny, do you like to skate? - Spent six months in the roller derby. - Seven and a half please, narrow if you've got it. Thank you. - I take a size 10 and a half over hammer boot with Sims wheels and Faulkner bearings. - Huh? - Over hammers. - Sorry, son, we only have skates here. - No, no, it's a type of skate. - What is? - Over hammers. - We're out. - Oh, that's it, I can't skate if they don't have over hammers, sorry. - Oh, come on, you're holding everybody up, don't be a wet blanket. - Come on, don't be a spoil sport. - Stick in the mud. - Troublemaker. - Pain in the ass. - All right, all right. Anything in a 10 and a half. - Yes, this is gonna be so much fun! - Keep reminding me. Nine and a half. Thanks. - Size five, please. - Skating rink without over hammers, I don't believe it. - Make that an eight. (upbeat music) - Aug? Aug, you're gonna wanna- Aug? Lace those up. - God, I haven't done this since I was a kid, I hope I don't look like a complete fool out there. - Not with me out there you won't. - Isn't this fun? - Oh, you know it. (upbeat music) - Help me! - Woo, yes, conga line! - Poetry in motion. Really bad poetry. - Don't just stand there, Casper, give me a hand. - I'd love to, but you're living, I'm dead, I lack substance. - So what else is new? - Smart ass. I can't, it's a rule. - A rule? Who made it up? - Well, let me put it this way. It wasn't a committee decision. Oh, I can touch inanimate things, chains, creaky doors, blenders, all that standard ghost crap. I'm just not allowed to touch people. - Why? What happens if you touch a person? - They don't say. They don't have to say. - Okay, well, how did you know Tracy was gonna bring us here? - I planted the suggestion in her dream last night. - Wow, you can do that? - Hey man, I'm supernatural, I can do lots of unexplainable things. Look, you've got a coin in your ear. Woo, now, think of a card. - Cut that out. - No, really, it was an incredibly romantic dream. The two of you, gliding along, hand in hand, you spin to a stop, the world around you's a blur. You look into each other's eyes, and you kiss. Fabulous kiss. You should have been there. - Yeah. No. No, this is never going to work. I've got two days to win her over from a guy that she's been seeing for over two years? - You have history together, you just never had the guts to follow through on it. First we have to get Neal out of the way, then you step in and well, kismet we hope. - I don't believe in kismet. - Well, you don't believe in ghosts, so you'd better look who you're talking to. (upbeat music) Can you believe this guy? He should be wearing a big, flashing neon sign that says I'm a dickhead. - Can you get those? - Come on, Isaac, it's easy! Don't be such a wallflower. (Isaac laughs) - Help me! - Use your stop, Aug! - The wall is good, too. (upbeat music) (Kris screams) - Come on, I'll give you a lesson. - Oh great, how to be a dickhead 101. - It's easy. I taught Tracy everything she knows, look how she's doing. - [Isaac] Well, hell, I can do that all right. - Get out of here. Well, you girls look like you're getting the hang of it. - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Does anybody wanna play pack and whip? - Great idea. Come on, here we go. (they shout and scream) (Tracy screams) - Isn't this fun? - Fun, I don't know, let's get a second opinion. Aug, look out! (Tracy laughs) - How am I doing so far? - The wall's still beating you, two to nothing. (Tracy laughs) - [Augie] Neal sure likes the girls, doesn't he? - Oh yeah, he's such a flirt. I guess it's something I'll have to get used to. Or kill him. (Isaac laughs) You know, I dreamt about this last night, and it was a lot more romantic. And not so painful. - How was I doing in your dream? - Well, you know how exaggerated dreams get. - Don't take them down in the rink, someone will get hurt. (upbeat music) (Neal shouts) - Ow! - That's gotta hurt. - Author, author! (they clap and whistle) - Now that's a great trick. - Ah! - Oh, I think he's really hurt. (Neal groans) (the women shout) - Careful, ow, ow! No, no, God no, just stay away from me! (they shout and groan) - Oh, I saw that coming. - Oh, oh this is not working. I'm gonna have to take this home and wrap it. Only trouble is, I don't think I can drive. This is my shifting arm. - To go with the shifty eyes. - Can anybody here drive an MG? - I can. Come on, I'll get you there in record time. - We could take you in Isaac's car. - No. - No. - No? - No. I mean, I've paid for two hours, you might as well get my money's worth. - Well, okay, bye. - You know, you probably wouldn't have fallen if you was wearing over hammers. - We'd better go too, kid. Come on, we gotta set up. Right, we'll see you guys tonight. - Okay, bye. Well, looks like it's just you and me, fella. - This is it, say something romantic. - Are you sweating as much as I am? ♪ You said that I meant everything in this world ♪ ♪ I should have stepped with caution ♪ ♪ But I walked right in ♪ ♪ I believed you 'cause I didn't know better then ♪ ♪ But today I can see through your little lies ♪ ♪ You see I found evidence ♪ ♪ I found evidence ♪ ♪ I found evidence ♪ ♪ When you said that you would love me till the end of time ♪ - Where are the guys? - They're late. - What a surprise. Look, Augie, I don't mind handling the bookings and the accounting and the PR. But I'm just not cut out to be a roadie. - I know, the guys just aren't as dedicated I guess. - Neither was the last band, or the one before that. Augie, you deserve better. Well, that's it for the sift, do you need any help setting up? - No, I'll handle it. Why don't you go back to the house and rest, or get changed, or eat? - Or all of the above. Nice of you guys to show up. - So, after the funeral, I went to Bob's house to be with his parents. And his Dad sold me the car. - That's my old man, never let sentimentality get in the way of making a quick buck. - He said having it around was too painful. - Oh, that's so sad. - It must have been real painful. In his grief, he turned the odometer back. Unless you've only driven six miles in the past 10 years. - Man, this is strange being back in Bob's car again. I have had so many great times in this car. - Yeah, I know. Most of them back here. - Trace, I've been wondering about something. This is gonna sound stupid, but, when you first met Bob and you first met me, what was it that attracted you to Bob? - Well, that's a toughie. I mean, he was cute, and funny. And talented. - Those are important qualities. - You know, I guess it was his confidence. Bob always knew what he wanted, and went right after it. Neal's like that too. - It's confidence, huh? - Yeah, I mean Bob was like a tidal wave, just coming at you all at once. Something like that's pretty hard to ignore. You, you're more like a glacier. - Thanks a lot. - No, I don't mean you're cold or anything. I just mean you move more slowly. And still you do make your presence felt. - Yeah, after about two million years. - And I was 22, I don't know, I was young and dumb. If I'd had any brains, I'd be with you. - You're kidding. - You're kidding. - No, I don't think so. I mean, I had great times with Bob, but you and I could always just talk like grown ups. You know, a lot of times I called there knowing he wasn't home, just so I could talk to you. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, Bob could be a real jerk sometimes. You know, I loved him and all that, but... Like that one time I opened this very glove compartment and found a bunch of condoms. - Yeah? - I was on the pill at the time. He just laughed it off and made a big joke. - [Bob And Tracy] I keep 'em there in case it rains. - Yuck. Hey, you bought my tape! - Yeah. - Hey, you haven't opened it. - No, no, the tape deck's on the blink. I don't know what's wrong. Oh my God, you fixed it, that's great, thank you! Thanks. - You didn't like my album. - What? No, no, that's not it. I loved it. I mean, I think it's... It's just that I haven't talked to you for so long, Tracy. I figured that you know, hearing your voice and not being able to respond would make me, I don't know, unhappy. So I bought it, but, I don't listen to it. It's stupid, I'm sorry. - No, it's okay, I understand. I'm sorry. I should have kept in touch better. (bright instrumental music) (car engine starts) - [Neal] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! I thought maybe you could just kiss it better. - [Ginny] That's not part of the course where I learned first aid. - [Neal] Where did you learn first aid? The girl scouts? - [Ginny] No, the Israeli Army. - You know, you are fascinating. Now, don't take this wrong, but you've always seemed sort of naked. Even with your clothes on. - That's funny, 'cause you always seem like you're wearing a tie. How's that feel? - Oh, oh, you've got a nice touch. Now, be honest. There was an attraction when we first met, wasn't there? - Honestly? Yeah, I thought you were kind of cute. (they laugh) - And you don't think so now? - Now I think you're kind of engaged. (they chuckle) - Are you playing hard to get? - Hard to get what? - That's up to you. - Hi, kids, sorry to barge in. - Ah! - I've got a splitting headache. Whew, how's our patient doing, Ginny? - Oh, he'll be okay. - Oh he'll be a lot better than just okay. - My head is pounding. I hope I'm better by tonight, Augie is so excited to be playing for his friends. He wants you to come too, Neal. - Oh! - So, what's for dinner? - Oh, a little surprise I'm whipping up. It should be very exciting. Ooh, and I'd better get going. See you later. - What happened to your headache? - He just left. - I got an idea. Let's go for a walk before dinner. - Oh, I would but, oh thanks, I should take it up there, I feel like I've pulled every muscle in my body this afternoon. I don't want to be limping down the aisle tomorrow. - Nope. - Hey, thanks for not abandoning me at the rink. - I tried to, I couldn't get my skates untied. - Well, whatever the reason, I appreciated it. (gentle music) - What's wrong? Where'd you disappear to? - Look at him go. I always wanted to do that. - Learn to be a bird? - Not just a bird. An eagle. Nobody messes with you when you're an eagle. - Yeah, but if you're a pigeon, you get free popcorn. - Look at that sucker go. Being dead really sucks sometimes, you know? - Really? I'm sort of getting the impression you like being dead. - Well, I don't mind it. But, I can't recommend it. Best thing is, I no longer have to floss. - It's your damn fault, you know. I mean, talk about a stupid way to die. - Hey, hey, I swerved to miss a seagull, and this cliff jumper- - You will never admit to making a mistake, will you? - All right, sure I will. This whole Tracy thing, I don't think it's working out. - What do you mean, not working out? You saw her back there, she kissed me. - On the cheek. A brother, an uncle, a priest you kiss on the cheek. I say let's forget it, let's drop it. - Hey, what's with you? I mean, you're the one who got me started on all this. - And I'm the one who's saying it's not working out. - Well, first you don't want her with Neal, and now you don't want her with me. Who the hell do you want her with? (gentle music) Oh, oh right. Okay, I get it. It's okay for Isaac to go after Tracy, as long as there's no chance he might actually score with her, right? - Hey, that's not what I'm saying. - I'm saying it because I'm not a threat. I'm not really a threat to a big stud like you, right? You know what, Tracy was right. You are a jerk! (gentle music) - Was, was! I'm dead, you idiot! (gentle music) - You're not listening to that thing again, are you? - Oh, I like it. I think it'd be great on the next album. - Oh, Tracy, it's not marketable. - Well, I don't agree. Wait till you hear it with a band playing. - I don't have to. Sweetie, this is my business. I know unorchestrated crap when I hear it. - So do I, and I think Isaac's very talented. - No, Isaac is a guy who may or may not have been talented at one time, but never had the cajones to do anything about it. We got 'em by the truck load in L.A. Now come on, give me a hand with dinner. - Oh, I haven't decided what I should wear tonight. - Tracy, for heaven sake's, it's a hick bar. If you wear shoes you'll be over dressed. Look, why don't you and I just stay home tonight? We could open a bottle of wine, put on some good music, I'll show you where the monkey bit me. (they chuckle) - Honey, I'm looking forward to going. Besides, I've got something special planned. - Oh, I don't think I could survive another one of your plans. Sweetie, I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood to drink bad three two beer, breathe stale cigarette smoke and listen to yet another self indulgent Van Halenesque guitar solo. - It won't be like that. Trust me. (rock music) (people chattering) ♪ I want ♪ - What can I get you? - What have you got? - Beer. - Sounds good. How about a pitcher and five glasses? - Do you have anything imported? - Yeah, the bartender's from Canada, you want to meet him? - No thanks. - Thank you! They sound great, don't they? (she laughs) ♪ It's a look to love the smell of her perfume ♪ ♪ I am ♪ ♪ I'm gonna make her mine ♪ - Getting my key. - How about high C? (he groans) (people cheer and clap) - Thank you, thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I present live and drinking beer, Miss Tracy Frazier. (people cheer and scream) And maybe with just a little prodding, we can persuade this week's rock and roll sensation to join us in a tune or two. (people clapping) - Tracy, I don't think this is a good idea. It sets a bad precedent. - What? - I don't want you performing for free. - Neal, don't be silly. - Tracy, I said no. - Hi, everybody. I'd like to do a cut from my yet unreleased album. And I want to dedicate it to a very dear someone who's here today, somewhere. Did you guys get a chance to rehearse? - We got through the whole thing almost once. - All right.

I will do that, first thing Monday morning. Thank you. - Don't mention it. (car horn beeping) - You don't have an attitude problem, do you? - Me, God no. - We don't relate well to people with attitude problems. You know, narrow minded people, small minded. - Oh, I know the type. I hate that type. - Because if this is somehow indicative of an attitude problem. - I think it's indicative. - Well, we can take care of this right now. - No, it's a short. Monday morning, the wire, first thing. Maybe even tomorrow if they're open. - Just so we understand each other. - Oh, we do. (he laughs) Oh, absolutely, we do. - I'm so pleased. - Goodnight. And thanks again, I really... (he sighs) (car horn beeping) (tense music) (people laughing) - Neal! What happened to you? Oh, what happened to you? - I got in a fight. - Who won? - You have to ask? - They all did. Although, I think one of them cut his knuckles on my bridgework. - Oh! - That'll show 'em. - Neal, I'm so sorry. - I didn't want to come up here in the first place, but no, we had to get married in the middle of God-damn nowhere. Why? What's so special about this place? I don't understand why we couldn't have just done it in Vegas like I wanted, get this shit over with. (tense music) - Oh sure, blame the dead guy for everything. - Shut up. - He never snaps like that. What did I do that was so horrible? - Maybe it wasn't you. - Oh, it has to be. I bring him to meet my friends, he belittles everybody, I just want to have fun and he complains. I dedicate a song to him, and he walks out. - That song was for him? - Who else would it be for? I just don't understand him. Why don't men come with instructions? - I could make the same argument for women. (she scoffs) Is it true that Bob once marked your body with a luminous pen? So he could find your erogenous zones in the dark. - No! - Yes! - It's just one of the many Bob legends that floated about. Most of which he made up. - Uh-huh, like the weekend at the sorority house? - All lies. - The woman from Fort Worth who picked him up hitchhiking? - Total fabrication. - And that thing with the nun. - That one's true. - No! - You know, this is just like old times. Remember Bob and I used to fight, and I'd sit up talking to you all night. That was fun. - The fights? - No, stupid. The talks. - I'll have to face north. - There you go, north. - What's going on? - We're having a seance. - Oh no. - I can sense his presence here all weekend, which I think might explain the problems Neal's been having. Sometimes the spirit world can shed some light. Now, if you'll all join hands with me, we'll begin. I'm going to ask one of my spirit guides to help escort us through to the other side. (eerie music) (she inhales sharply) Oh, spirit guide. - Yes, kimosabe. (Isaac coughs) - Spirit guide, tell us your name. Spell it for us. - Mystery ghost, won't you sign in, please. - B. - Oh, it's a trick. Somebody's stopping it. - How, we're all holding hands. - Got a magnet at my dick. Hey Ginny, now I can tell you which way north is. - Shh. O, it's spelling something. G. - Shit, it's really hard to read this thing upside down. - B, O, G. Bog, what does it mean? - Bob, maybe? - No, Bob has a B at the end. Is it Bob? - This is too weird. Cut it out, you guys. - Everybody, hold hands. Bob is clearly Earth bound. A confused spirit who has not yet accepted his death. - Hey, I've accepted it. I stopped getting mail, and everything. - Bob, we are all here for you tonight. Our energy flows towards you and you alone. Would you like to talk to him, Trace? - Talk? - Go ahead. - I can't. - I can. Say Bob, in heaven, is Elvis fat like when he died, or thin like when he was cool? - Elvis isn't dead. - Just yes or no questions. Bob can only respond by tapping once for yes and twice for no. - Where did she learn this crap? - Once yes, twice no? Have you seen God? (knocking once) Does He like you? (knocking twice) Son of a bitch, it is Bob! (Isaac laughs) - Bob, hi, this is Kris. God, isn't this weird? (knocking once) Is that my question? (knocking once) Oh. - What should my question be? Is there an afterlife? (knocking twice) Bummer. - Oh, this is really stupid. Bob, you never really said it when you were here. Did you love me? (knocking once) (Neal knocking once) - Oh, that son of a bitch, Isaac, ask the question again. - Bob, let me ask- - Enough, the spirits grow weary. - Oh shit, the spirit grows pissed, Issac, ask her the question again! - Please Bob- - It's too late, I feel the energy fading. - Come on! - Let's wrap this up. - Oh wrap this up! - It's time for Bob to pass on to the next plane. - No, no, no, wait, Ginny. - Follow your spirit guide, Bob, pass on. - Bob? - Bob is gone. He's moved on to the next astral plane. I am drained. - Can we turn in now? - [Tracy] I'll be there in a minute. - [Augie] What time is the next show? - Bob? (solemn music) Bob! - Drinking alone? That's the first sign of a drinking problem. - Do not do that. - Hey, I'm a ghost. If I don't spook somebody, I can't join the union. - Ginny sent you away. - Hey, I'll leave when I'm damn good and ready. - Ah! - Sorry, did I startle you? - No, no. Well, yeah, a little. Listen, are you okay? - I don't know what I am anymore. Look, I have a favor to ask. - Anything. - You know how it's bad luck for the bride and groom to see each other the night before the wedding, blah, blah, blah, would it be okay if Neal bunked with you tonight, please? - Let me qualify anything. - Please, please, please, please, please, please, please. - The things that I do for you. - Thank you. You're one in a million. - Kisses on the cheek don't mean squat. (bright music) (Isaac coughing) (window creaking) - Uh, could you open that just a little bit more? Uh, too much, back in just a couple of inches. (window creaking) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. You're past it, now back just a tad. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Too much, in just a hair. Was that so difficult? Ah, have you seen my glasses anywhere? - I didn't know you wore glasses. - Oh yeah, contacts, actually. Now where did I put those darn things? - Dickhead. - Oh, hello! I didn't know anyone else was up. I was just out for a stroll. How's the water? - It's very cold. There are a lot of weeds and slime- - Sounds great, do you mind if I join you? Oh listen, you have nothing to worry about, I'm practically married. I mean, I'm getting marr- God, these button holes are small. (gentle music) (Ginny screaming) (water splashing) (tense music) (Ginny laughing) - Hey, let's get everybody down here. - Shh, no, no, no, no, no. They're no fun! (Ginny laughs) (tense music) - Come here and take a look at this. This is so incredible, you're not gonna believe this. Come on, where are you going? Hey, it's over here. Oh, for crying out loud! - What's going on? - Oh, I was just getting a snack. Neal's not keeping you up, is he? - Neal, no, not at all. Do you mind if I join you? - Sure, that'd be nice. - No, stupid, open the door, let her see that he's gone! (he groans) Oh, oh, look! - I'll be right there. What's the matter with you? - You're screwing everything up! - Is that Ginny? (Ginny laughing) Bob, she's naked. - Thanks for explaining it, it's been a long time for me. Schmuck, take a look who's with her! (Ginny laughing) - Is that, Jesus! - No, and it ain't John the Baptist either. - Isaac. - What? - I was gonna make a ham sandwich, do you? - Oh yeah, fine, terrific. I'll be right in. We're really rotten. - Excuse me? - Oh, I said cotton. Best kind of material for blinds, cotton. - I'm rotten, what did I do? - You put Neal up tot his, didn't you? And you had to involve Ginny. - Hey, don't blame me for this, pal! This is 100% U.S. grade A Neal. I just want Tracy to see him in action. - How is that gonna make her feel? It's gonna crush her, that's how. She's still got feelings for the guy, whether we like it or not! - Isaac? - What! Oh, I'm sorry, what? - Do you want mustard in your sandwich? - Mustard. - You want her to marry that dickhead? Or do you want her for yourself? Come on, stud, you can do it. All you have to do is pull back the blinds. Just pull back the blinds and she's yours. - You bastard. - Pardon me? - Mustard, I said, I would love mustard. - Okay. - You're chicken. You've always been chicken. - I can't do it that way. I won't do it that way. - You're being completely irrational. - No, it's true, it's all Bob's fault. - What's he done now? - Doesn't anyone sleep around here? - Augie feels that if Bob hadn't died when he did, then he would be more successful right now. - The band was right on the verge before his accident. If that hadn't happened, I know I wouldn't still be playing dives. - Well, I guess we'll never know. - Are you guys hungry? - Yeah, thanks. - Well, at least he said thanks. - That's new, isn't it? (Ginny laughing) - This is too easy. - So, what's it like being with the same person for, God, how long has it been now? - 12 years this Halloween. - Right, yeah. - It's great, most times. Sometimes it's a drag. I don't know. I just think Augie wants to be more successful before he gets married. Well anyway, you don't want to be talking about this stuff, you're getting married. It's a joyous occasion! Hey, you're not getting cold feet, are you? - God, I don't know. That whole seance thing unnerved me more than I thought. Maybe I'm really not over Bob. - Trace, Bob is dead. - Sorry. Got it. - I know, it just feels unresolved. Especially tonight. Maybe it's just normal, when you're making a big change in your life, you look back over the past and the times you screwed up, you know, just to make sure you're not repeating yourself. Right? (playful music) - Do you think maybe in a past life I was a shark? - More like a shrimp, I think. - Well, the water's very cold. (they laugh) - Where are our clothes? - We took them off, remember? - Didn't we leave them on the dock? - Sure, silly, they're on- Where the hell are my clothes? Christ! - Relax, I'll go get to the house and get some more. - No, no, no, no, what if somebody sees you? What do you say? - I'll say I'm getting some clothes for Neal. - Forget it, I'll go. - Okay, I'll come with you. - No! You stay here, get into the water. - But I'm getting all pruney. - Stay! (gentle music) (water splashing) - [Isaac] No, just now, when I went to war. (Tracy laughs) Get it? - Isaac, this is really good. I didn't know you could cook. - There's a lot of things about me you don't know. What are you looking at? - Nothing, you all finish up, okay? I'll see you in the morning? Goodnight. - Let her go, Isaac. (playful music) - Ah! - This is kinky! - I can explain. - Don't explain, I like it! - You do? - You always seem so upset, I've never seen this side of you. At least not out of doors. - Moon's low tonight. Sailor's delight. (she giggles) - Hey, guys! Oh, I'm so glad I caught up with you. - Neal, why is she wearing your pajamas? - Oh Neal, it was incredible. You'll never believe what I saw. - What'd you see? - It was incredible. - Neal, what did you see? - Absolutely mind blowing. Oh, here are your pants. - Ah, it's not what you think. I was swimming, she came by, she was cold, so I gave her my pajamas. - Neal, don't say anything. We'll talk in the morning. - Sweetie, nothing happened. - We'll talk in the morning. - Absolutely nothing. - In the morning. - Shit!

I should have been better to her when I had the chance. (upbeat piano music) - Did you really mean that stuff you said? About me being chicken all my life? - Yeah. You're not a bad guy, Isaac. Every once in a while though, you need a kick in the ass. You still think I'm a rotten jerk bastard? - Yeah. (they laugh) Will I see you again? - Hey, don't start getting mushy on me, okay? I'll be around. - Where? - Reincarnation's like a cosmic crap shoot. Play by the rules, you might wind up a big winner. But you know my problem with rules. Hey, life's not so bad.

(wind chime tinkling) - You need a hand with that? - Oh thanks, but I'd rather do this myself. - I can't do this. Can you tie a bow tie? (Augie laughs) Look who I'm asking. Kris? - Tracy? Tracy, how do you expect a marriage to work without trust? What else do you want me to do? I've already- - This is better than cable. - Tracy, we love each other, you know that. - No, I don't know that. I do know I will not allow myself to be treated that way ever again. Bob got away with it, that was my fault, I let him. I'm older now thank God, and I don't have time for this garbage. - Tracy, this is more than a marriage. If you walk out on me now, that qualifies as breach of contract. I'll see you in court, hun. You'll see my lawyers in court, hun. You'll see me on MTV. (birds singing) (car engine starts) (bright music) What a dickhead. - Are you okay? - I will be. - Listen, I realize you probably have a lot on your mind this morning, but... Could I ask you one key question? - Sure, what? - Do you know how to tie a bow tie? (she laughs) No, wait, that's not it. I mean, I need to tie it, but... Listen, Tracy. About last night. - Oh, hey, last night was a weird night, for everybody. God, I guess it finally dawned on me that Neal had all of Bob's bad qualities, but none of the good ones. You know, sometimes a tidal wave will sweep you away and sometimes it'll just drown you. - [Kris] Tracy, telephone! Long distance. - Hi, this is Tracy. - Tracy, listen. - Hi, Sol. - Listen, you're beautiful, can I talk to- - No, actually, you can't speak to Neal, he's gone. - For coffee? - No, for good. - Oh, you made my day! - Thanks, Sol. So, what's going on? - What is going on? Where'd Neal go? (she chuckles) - Hey, is this wedding on or off? - Off, I think. - What do I do with this Rabbi here? - Actually, I'm a Minister. - Trace, shall we send the Reverend home? - Jesus! Excuse me, Rev. Christ, Ginny, what the hell happened to you? - A miracle, I think. Last night, a sign, a stick, an old dead branch stood upright by itself and... And wrote a word in the sand. - [Kris] What did it say? - Schmuck. And it hit me. I am being a schmuck. I have traveled from one end of this Earth to the other, trying to figure out what life was, what God was, what I was. And last night it hit me. I think too much. I mean, life is really not that bad, unless you think it to death. I got to work on that. But you know what they say. Rejoice not in inequity, but rejoice in the truth. Bear all things. - Believe all things, trust all things, endure all things. Very nice. Corinthians chapter 13, verse five. - Verse six. But what the hell. - Say, Augie, I'm in the market for a temporary drummer. You interested? - Trace, about the Reverend here. - He plays the drums? - What do you mean temporary? - Well, eight months. I just found out, my drummer broke his wrist last night, in of all things, a roller skating accident. So we're going out on tour for eight months, I can't promise you anything more than that. - Listen, you don't have to do this for me. - I'm not doing this for you, I'm in a bind, you'd be doing me a favor. - Okay. All right. But now you owe me one. (they laugh) Eight months, hell, that's practically a career for me! - Trace, what about the Reverend here? - Okay, hang on, hang on. The wedding will start in 10 minutes. - Well so, who's the happy groom? - Beats the hell out of me. (gentle music) (birds singing) I suppose now's a lousy time to ask. Will you marry me? - Yes. - Yeah, you would! (she laughs) - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today under the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to join together this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
