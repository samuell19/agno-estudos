Hey, so tell me why you so whack in ball? - Yo, you trash. - You're just mad that you can't shoot. - Look, I know you want to be like Steph Curry, but you just curry goat. [laughing] Yo, I need you to hook me up. - Okay. I give you 10, give me 11. - Nah, man, for real. I don't got any money on me. I need something to eat. Yo, I really need it, man. - [Rekesh] There's cameras. - You think your uncle's watching these cameras? This'll just be between us, man. - I don't know, man. - Aight, look, if you hook me up, next time I see you at the park, I'll play you 1-on-1. - Okay, just hurry. [tracks rattling] - [William] You in or not? And you don't have to be gentle with him. - [Chad] He gets dropped in the lobby. - No, that's not going to work. - [Chad] You can bring him up yourself. - You know what? I'll just have my assistant Melissa take care of it. I mean, [chuckles] how hard could it be, right? - Full payment in cash before the job. - No way. It's not happening. [muted, upbeat music] - [Robert] Who is that? - [Melissa] It's a personal meeting. - Oh. Oh, do you have the weekly reports for me? - Oh... I am so sorry, sir. But I can bring them by your house on my way home tonight. - No. It's okay. It's not that important. My brother should not have you bringing work to our house. Our father would never have allowed that. - I can wire you the money. - I said cash. - It's a fake kidnapping for a surprise birthday party. It's not a drug deal. - [Chad] Good luck finding someone else. - I'm just doing what is asked of me. I appreciate your concern. - Good night. - Good night, sir. - Fine. Deal. [Melissa hums] [pen clatters] - Hm, this guy's no joke. Doesn't break character. - Here's the paperwork you asked about earlier. - Why do you wear that every day? - What? This? - Yeah, it looks like a five-year-old made it. [Melissa chuckles] - It's from someone special. It reminds me of home. Nothing like yours. - This? This is actually my favorite watch. You didn't tell anyone about the surprise, did you? - Of course not. - Okay, good. [laughing] [phone ringing] [television blaring] - [Todd] Yo, what's up? - You home? - Yeah. - Meeting in an hour. [muted rap music] [phone buzzing] - [Shannon] Yo, what do you want? - What's up, ugly? - [Shannon] Ugly? Do you own a mirror? - Bruh, I got mirrors for days. Yo, listen up. We got a meeting in an hour. - Aight. Say no more. [soft music] [panting] [phone buzzes] [panting] - [Shannon] You always chilling, man. - Yeah, better than working. - Psh, whatever. Ayo, can I grab something to drink? I had to rush over here. - Yeah man, it's cool. I know you're broke. Ooh! I get community service credit for this. - Yo, broke? Never that. - Okay. [chuckles] Oh my gosh, bro. Dude... Yo, check this out. So this girl hasn't responded to a single text in six months, right? - Yeah? - I ain't heard nothing back. But... she will like literally every single photo I post, bro. Our generation is hopeless, man. Bro, Kobe Bryant was the greatest of all time, AKA the GOAT. He had five rings. He had the second most points in any NBA game in history, 81. He's a gold medal- - Hold on. Six rings, alright? Multiple defensive player of the year. Literally the GOAT. Michael Jordan. What are you talking about? - Your opinion is isn't even valid, bro. - How is my opinion not valid? - You're a Knicks fan, bro! [laughs] It's okay. There's always next season. - [Shannon] Whatever. - We got a job next Tuesday. We're kidnapping a CEO for a surprise birthday party. - Nah, you gotta be joking. - Wait, can I be the clown? Please? - First we secure him, then we go for his safe. - See, now why didn't you just say that from the jump? - Yeah wait, hold up. Who are we even kidnapping? - The target is Robert Chang. His brother William hired us. - Robert Chang? Why does that sound so familiar? - [Shannon] Chang Imports. Yo, I know that family got bank. I needed this. - This is it for me. - [Shannon] What? But you never even got caught... and I thought that we were all in this together.

But I'm going out of town and... I needed to give you this. - What is this? - This is from your father. He wanted you to have it. He gave it to me before he passed. - Why didn't he just give it to me himself? - You were away on business and ah... he asked me to hold on to it for you. I thought it'd be best to wait. Hold until things calmed down. Hey. How's big bro? - I don't know. It's been a little rough. - Don't sweat it. I have a good feeling you'll work things out. Come here.

Tomorrow night at midnight, we're going to throw him a little surprise party. Gonna need you all there. - I have a family. That's not possible. - That's six hours after work. - Look, he doesn't have many friends. I need you all there to pull this off. - I can't stay out that late. - Alright. The best I can do is 10:00 PM. You all get paid overtime. Melissa will give you the rest of the details. Take care of them.

How'd you come in contact with them? So we have to figure out how they found you. Trace it back. We can't go back in time. Let's move forward. Backtrack. Yeah? - I might have something for you.

Looks like you're taking a deuce. - Oh, how cute, the Two Musketeers think they funny. [Todd scoffs] - So ah... I got to be out. - Yeah, just no more leaving early. Okay, cowboy? - Keep talking and I'ma smack the fire out you, man. [Todd laughs] We out. - Yeah, that's right, keep walking. You're lucky this counter's in the way, otherwise I'd jump you. [birds chirping] [ominous music] - Yo, I've been dreaming about this for the past month. - Like us walking together? Do you want to hold my hand? - Aye yo, stop playin', man. You need like a girlfriend or something to occupy your mind. - Nah, man. All I need is them fat stacks, bro. - Facts, son. [tense music] - [Todd] Yo man, so what are you going to do with your cut? - Probably going to buy me a new crib. - And a new couch, and new gear, and new boots! - Aight! Just open the door. - Yeah. Tell me about this chick that was texting you. - Oh. - What she talkin' about? - I got an update for you. So she texted me. - Right. [tense music] - [Todd] She changed her number six months ago, so that's why I wasn't hearing nothing back. - Oh. - I was playing hard to get and I didn't even realize, bro. Chad. [ominous music] - Yo, what's up? - Chad. [ominous music] Hey, what's going on? Chad! What's he doin'? - Yo. [ominous music] - It's nice to finally see you. - [William] Robert! [gun shoots] No! [tense, dramatic music] - I'll admit this was a birthday to remember. I hope you don't mind me crashing the party. So where's my stuff? - I don't know. - You don't know? Look, all I want is my watch and the envelope. That's it. You can keep everything else. I don't think you understand what those things mean to me. - I think I do. - My brother started this all, and I can forgive him. - Yo, this can't be happening, man. - Bro, what are you doing? - Yo man, we gotta go. Now, man, we gotta go. Yo, we gotta go, now. - Lay off of me! I'm not leaving my brother, you crazy? [Todd grunts] [Shannon sighs] Stupid man! [ominous music] [distant police sirens] - Your father must be very proud. - I made my own choices. [sirens blaring] I'll live with them. [sirens blaring] - [Officer] Put your hands up! Hands behind your head. [indistinct Police radio chatter] - Thank you. [jewelry clatters] [soft music] - [Father] Dear Robert, from the moment mom brought you into this world, you have given me unimaginable joy. You've surpassed all my expectations without any of my shortcomings. Robbie, keep making me proud. I love you. Dear William, I'm sorry that your mother left us so soon. She understood you in all the ways I refused to. The truth is, I used to be more like you. Grandpa was a man of tradition, so I conformed to gain his respect. I'm sorry I didn't accept you as you are. Will, I'm proud of you for having more courage than I ever had. I love you more than life itself. I've amended the inheritance. Everything is now equal. Please forgive me and make amends with your brother. I am so blessed to have two unique sons. Be not afraid of growing slowly. Love, dad. [melancholy orchestral music] - [William] I'm so sorry. [melancholy orchestral music] [rustling] [William chuckles] My watch. [soft, mysterious music] I might have something for you. - We need to know where everything is or we won't be able to help you. - [Melissa] Sir. - [Robert] Perfect. [soft, mysterious music] - He made a huge deal out of it. - That doesn't change the plan. - Okay. I love you. - [Robert] Call the cops! - Here, hold this. - [Melissa] No, wait. It's okay. We don't need to call the cops, okay? - Do you want to see your son again? Because that's what you're up against. - That's all I know. - You're going to be under surveillance. I wouldn't leave your house for any reason.
