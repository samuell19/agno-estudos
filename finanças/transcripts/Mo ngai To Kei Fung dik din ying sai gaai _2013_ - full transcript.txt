Your right side. Yes, okay. Three, start rolling. Cut! Damn it. I can't go on. Let's call it a day. Seriously, think about what you've been doing! At first-- No! So was personnel recruiting. You even messed up just finding people! And you dare to talk back! Look out! You must be bloody blind. There are people back there! -Stop the car, Mister. -Alright. Is this car going up? Let Sammi ride with you then, alright? You should push the dolly when the actor pushes the door. This was not recorded. This-- Let me show you. Where's the final position? -Start rolling. -Slate. What are you two doing? Didn't you hear me? -Michael is in Kunming! -Who is that? Michael Liu! -Okay? -Okay. Alright. There are quite a lot of abnormalities in mainland China. One film crew can have hundreds of vehicles. I have no idea what's the use of so many vehicles. In Hong Kong, shooting is supposed to be simple and clear. You stay if you have things to do, or you leave. You are always fucking chatting. Chatting with this guy, then with another. And God knows what that guy is doing. Get the hell out of here. You are on the set, so take care of the things on set. Everything is fucking wrong. How come? Where is the watering pot? Or just give me some water. Let me do this. You're wearing gloves. No, you take this. I must admit, I do scold. I won't deny it. What else could it be? I did scold them. That's what I do when I'm upset. As a professional, everyone should stick to their post. Everyone should have a professional attitude. I believe that people who have worked with me will understand why I've scolded you or why I've lost my temper. For me to do that, something must be wrong on the set. -It's tipping over! -Come on, one, two, three! Okay, now it's right. -One, two, three, push! -Come on! -One, two-- -It won't turn! -Help Lin. -Stop. Just let one man do the talking. Come on. One, two, move! -And the rest of you, just shut up. -Yes, sir. He doubted the current situation of the mainland film industry, or even particular films. We would communicate. Meanwhile, he didn't stand back, he tried to enter this market. I think he came here with a doubtful and critical attitude. Just push it over there in one go. Have a rest. -Ready! -Let's go! -Come on, guys! -One, two, three! -Come on! -Use all your strength! The geographic conditions posed great difficulties in filming this one. Not just the intense production schedule. Also, the weather was challenging and freezing. After all, we are southerners. We are not built to resist the cold there. There was also the problem of altitude illness. The most severe case was over two dozen people getting sick at the same time. Actually, we had staff sent to the hospital every day. -He has altitude sickness. -Call the doctor. This won't do. Cut! Do it again! The car wasn't satisfying, and neither were you. Cough first, then go out, get it? What does professional really mean? If I call myself a professional director, if I dare to make that statement, it means I will get a movie done no matter how hard it is. Whatever happens, a professional can't leave his post. Almost all the staff, including the sick ones, didn't leave the crew. We stood until the end together. This is the spirit I see in Milkyway Image. Milkyway Image is not a center for art films. Milkyway Image is a tribute to cinema. Apart from sticking to originality, we have to survive first. So we have to balance, which doesn't mean we would go against our principles, or that we haven't tried our best to create. We can do any kind of films, be it commercial or art. Now I'll make my staff show you. This flag sign means we need smoke. Do you see that? In the last couple of years, both Ka-fai Wai and I have done some work in mainland China. We would discuss the issue of entering the mainland market. The conclusion was, why not try it out? Certainly, co-productions have... both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that we can have more subjects to choose from. And the disadvantage is, as many have mentioned, that censorship is different than in Hong Kong. Co-productions have to adapt to the censorship and filming conditions in mainland China. I think our films have hardly made any progress in these years. If we lose creative freedom when making films in a different environment, we are no more than a tool. I believe that only when our local culture regains its strength, will we have the chance of rebirth. If all we want to do is make co-productions with mainland China, Hong Kong won't enjoy a good chance to re-develop its culture. I think a city without its own cinema is quite pathetic. Because cinema is part of a city's culture I think the success of Lifeline is owed to the Hong Kong film spirit. It has many big scenes, however the budget was only about six million HKD, from which the basic expense accounted for two or three million. Taking off the wages for actors, directors, and writers, we were left with just over one million. How can you shoot all these big scenes with only one million? I could hardly do that again now, even just one scene. It's impossible. At that time, the whole crew were working very hard. Everyone was doing extra jobs to help. Think about it, how could we use real fire? Even I was startled at the scale of it. Just see how I got blown up by that fire. I'm really touched after watching it again, because it was due to the incredible determination and boldness of the whole crew. The most endangered ones were not the actors, but the filming crew, including the cameramen. To produce a burning ceiling with heavy fire, layer upon layer, we needed to use a great deal of oil gas. Once, we set a lot of oil gas, but waited a long time before the ignition and we didn't know why. The oil gas started to spread to people's feet and everybody was nervous. Meanwhile, Mr. To was watching the monitor from a distance, with a cigarette between his fingers. It was really tense. The cameraman knew it was going to be a tough one, because the fire would definitely come close to him. And we prepared safety measures for him, drawing the thick smoke by a big fan behind him and reducing the heat with a hose. He went wherever the fire went. I was in charge of the explosion. I wouldn't let others do it. Sometimes, To would do it on his own because he knew what he wanted. I believe nowadays, we can't find a team like that anymore. People in the industry know that I've worked with the same crew for over ten years. Their dedication, passion and devotion are way better and greater than the movies themselves. Thanks to the same experiences, we don't need too many words to communicate our approach. During the past two decades or so, I wouldn't have been be able to make these movies without my team. Here's today's paper. Will it be a wasted effort again? Well, if only this were tomorrow's paper, then we could find out what happens. Fly calling Centipede. I think what matters most in filmmaking is whether we can improve ourselves each time. I suggest we try and challenge ourselves. Me, and the whole team, because only after prolonged practice can we truly make progress. I said, how about a long take? I had hoped to shoot for 10 minutes or so but when we got hands on, the difficulties appeared bigger and bigger. I said, he must make it in the first take, no matter if the equipment works or not. Because you can't shoot a second take soon after the vehicles have exploded. Since over 50 cars were involved, with all the glass blown out, rearranging it after the explosion would take a week. That's why he only got one single chance. I remember it took us three days for rehearsals. The scene became a huge challenge... and team work was a vital element. The whole scene was tense, and required perfect cooperation. Nobody was allowed to make a single mistake. Everyone should think clearly about what to do and when, and who's in charge of placing the props. It's like we were all on a big stage. I remember we did four or five rehearsals that morning. Everyone was too nervous to eat. At mealtime, we were all like "Come on. Don't stop for a meal. Shoot first, or we'll lose the momentum." -Please don't give me a ticket. -Okay. -I'll let you off just this once. Go now. -Thank you, sir. What's in that bag? I said, what's in that bag? Hoi! -We're in a gunfight. We need backup! -Cricket, get over here and help us. When the camera was pulled back, the crew had to quickly remove the track, lay mud, and set guideposts and so on. There was only ten seconds to let everyone go. With the camera moving at that pace, the grips, actors, and assistant directors got tired of running along as well. I had to watch the wireless monitor during the gun fight, and I had to press the buttons to explode the vehicles following the camera, as well as the reaction bombs on the floor and wall. This was the most difficult part, not the camera part or acting, which just required correct positioning. Mr. To asked them all not to speak but to listen to my orders. Speak as little as possible because the tension was so high that talking would cause confusion about whom to listen to. And just do as they're told, even if the guns don't work. I was just watching the monitor during the actual shooting, but both of my hands were inexplicably swollen after that. My adrenalin rose due to the strain. After that long take, I felt that I should be more accurate when giving instructions. What I stick to is so important that things could've turned out very different had I made any concessions. If I was afraid of difficulties, some scenes would never have been seen. HONG KONG MILKYWAY IMAGE At that time, it was so hard that I couldn't pay my staff. But they were all waiting patiently. Even without pay, they still worked for me when other pictures needed them. The market was very bad at that time. We just relied on trust. Because of the trust, we would do it even without payment. He worked with little rest in that period. He slept in a cot in the company at the most difficult time. Sometimes, he couldn't manage to wake up in the morning. So I had to wake him up like, "Director! Time to work." He might spend the whole night working on the script. Those days might be the hardest days of my life. I couldn't afford the office rent when things were at their worst. To be frank, if I was out of work for half a year, I could go bankrupt. I had no idea how long it would be until I had no movies to make, or until I'd run out of energy. I thought I wouldn't leave Hong Kong no matter how tough it gets, even though nobody was willing to invest in movies. Since the film market had already collapsed, and people no longer had confidence in any film subjects, why not do something in my flavor? The Mission was made when Milkyway Image was at its lowest point. We were not able to help in films. The only thing we could offer was our clothes, and even our cars. My car was badly damaged during one shoot. I remember chatting with the cinematographer Siu-keung Cheng. He said, "I'm afraid there's not enough film for editing. " And I said, "Really? How much have we got?" The film length of The Mission is about 8500 feet, while the whole length we'd shot was less than 40,000 feet. The ratio is about 1:4, which is very low. In the following days, I continued to work at Milkyway Image I used to watch how Mr. To did the editing. Apart from the bad takes, he really made full use of the film. There was just enough to make up a complete movie. Having finished cutting The Mission, we wanted to shoot for an extra day. But we had no money. I could only shoot after the mall closed at 11:00 p.m. and we had to leave before six in the morning. At that time, the budget wasn't enough. I went scouting four hours in advance. In that environment, I quickly came up with the whole scene. The inspiration was from a sense of pressure, which was very important. I like wide shots and having many people in it. There were several roles in that scene. They enter the scene together. They were an organic whole in the scene. I don't want to miss a single person in the picture, unless they're standing at a distance from each other. I think close shots should be used less in widescreen movies. When there are less, I need to know very clearly what every shot's language expresses. For example, the characters' position in the mall. What I concentrated on was how to match the setting with the characters and what kind of layout it would display. I believe that, since he started his career from television and the space and effect that a TV can accommodate is limited, he would inevitably or unconsciously, try to rise above the limitations of television, one of which is the screen size. After setting everyone's position to compose a frame, the hardest thing is to figure out what's next. And then what comes after that. In my opinion, Hong Kong films are not suitable for widescreen. One reason is that our urban landscapes are not so good. They're fairly narrow. Another reason is that our actors' figures are relatively small in Asia. Johnnie To uses more people to fill the widescreen, in order to compensate for this inherent weak spot of Hong Kong actors. Sean, stay farther away, and back a bit. Stay a little bit away from the camera. No, that's too much. -Sorry. -You can always pay back my money. -Sorry. -But you can't break the rule. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I'll make an example of you! No one will break my rule! I think his primary concern is space, especially the characters' position in the space. Because that indicates their dramatic relationship. In order to broaden the view, his scenes are mostly set in the evening. Because only in the evening, will the whole street be vast and empty and allow him to put a large number of people in different locations. When we were shooting The Mission, I originally wanted to set a lighting with a strong stage-effect in the mall, but we failed because we were short of money. To achieve such an effect, we would need a dozen 4k and 12k lights. When we started to shoot PTU, Director To wanted the lights coming from up high to put all the characters in the focus, and achieve a sort of stage-like effect. The biggest problem then was that all the streetlights in Hong Kong were a shade of yellow. We wanted a different tone, a white light with a hint of blue by using HMI light. We tried a lot of methods. The production team spent a lot of effort on it, too. We often needed to borrow roofs, trying one building after another. When it failed, we came up with another idea. On the first afternoon, we covered the streetlights with black cloth and hung the HMI lights one by one on the light poles. I think, in cities, we can all vaguely see the surroundings, but how they look or how real they are isn't important because I focus on people. So the surroundings would seem comparatively vague, but you still roughly know what they are. I don't want trivial things in the background to dominate the frame. I think the going upstairs scene in PTU totally tests the imagination of a director. The scene was really created "out of nothing." There was nothing in there. No script was needed. But he created a scene of strong suspense and intensity. He made good use of the heavy atmosphere among the cops. They suspect the peril upstairs. Plus, he took advantage of the narrow space on the stairs. The cops walk from a spacious street into the limited space of narrow stairs. The contrast of space was also set out to bring the character closer psychologically. Because, initially, these characters are at odds with each other. In the script, Simon Yam was supposed to go upstairs. Originally, it was pretty simple. Yam just went up and we saw the torch light. There were also some conversations. But Mr. To cut them out, so there is no talking. There is no need for talk because they are all clear about the situation. I remember that when we shot that movie, the schedule was tight and we were short of money, so I had no choice but to shoot that scene with the actors standing between two cars. I put a lot of thought into that scene and decided that the camera would stand still for the whole scene. I tried to capture the characters' psychological activities only by imagination. I believed that these cops all have a lot of doubts and questions. If one emotionally enters that dramatic world, naturally, he will wait and see whether they decide to go up or not. I created this scene, basically, from the perspective of script, and then tried to render it in film language. How was this misinterpreted in the first place? As Sean said, Milkyway Image, hard to imagine. There is no completed script at all, so how can one conjure any imagination? You'll only get several pages of script. This shooting style needs actors with great energy. As the title indicates, Exiled was designed with a wish to let people exile themselves a bit. Actors need not care about the script, and actually nobody needs to. Just see what I could get in the end. Though I had no script for The Mission, I had the whole arrangement in my head. But Exiled was shot with no fixed plan. Whenever I'd go somewhere and find the setting cool, I'd get on with the production. After it was done, I would do the next. I just filmed along the way. Don't ask me about my plan because I had no idea either. I just shot wherever I went. Which way? Which way? You decide. Just pick one! I would shoot whenever I'd have an idea. If I went back home, I'd just eat and sleep. I wouldn't think about the movie. Once I'd wrapped up the day's work, I wouldn't keep thinking about it. I'd only think about the production on the set. I really enjoyed those days. -I can't even beat you like this. -Of course. Damn! I win. When I was making Exiled, I wished to enjoy the filmmaking world. It's actually a little bit like a game for fun. In actuality, the production atmosphere was pretty bad. Because many colleagues in the production crew were very anxious to know what the movie looked like, and wanted to enter the director's world or the screenplay. But what we got was always just the story outline or the scene outline, which often got changed on site. I remember when we shot Triangle, the actors from mainland China all came to ask me, "Where's the script?" I said, "The script? It is still being written." They said, "No way! What shall we do then?" A veteran actor asked me, "What should we do? What shall we do next? Still no script? No. What do we do?" "What do we do? Everything will be okay when we rehearse it." I fully believe that, through this way of filmmaking, he would discover what his film is trying to convey. This is a shooting style that proceeds along with life itself, which is actually a very beautiful experience, even if it entails hardship. It is absolutely a process that will bring vitality and brilliance into a movie. Mr. Wai said it well, sometimes, we only have the beginning part of a movie, but as we shoot it, it will naturally lead us to the following development. You no longer control the movie, the movie itself will lead a character or an event to emerge. Mr. Wai would sometimes say, "It should play out like this. But I haven't figured out the previous transition yet." We increasingly feel movies have life. At the beginning, we only had a very vague concept about it, but now the feeling is getting stronger. A movie will tell you that a certain role should have a certain personality. And the plot development should be like this. Some movies can be finished in a short time, some take a long time, and some even go through many twists and turns. But it's all right, because each movie has its own life. I think, unconsciously, this has become a well-respected creative principle for Milkyway Image. Good morning. Good morning. Excuse me. Where's the toilet? Excuse me. Where's the toilet? Before Needing You, we had never worked with Sammi Cheng. Once we started collaborating, we found that this actress has her own rhythm for comedy and her own interesting traits. If you ask me how I guided Sammi, I have never taught her acting at all. Mr. Wai and I just captured her... her strong suits, and revised the screenplay accordingly. They watched my performance on the set and changed the screenplay accordingly by adding or deleting some content based on my performance and my characteristics. It's erased. Consistent or not? Come on! All right, the wheels are shaking. No problem. The first time I played a role in Mr. To's movie, which was Needing You, I felt he trusted in my performance which really gave me confidence to carry on acting. I trust him and I like him. All along, he has been clear about what he wants. He is really talented in guiding an actor or actress, whether he or she is good at acting, to the direction that he needs. When we were about to shoot the movie, he would take out the screenplay and re-digest it. He's the kind of director who doesn't make storyboards. He would immediately draw it out with the screenplay. Because the schedule is tight, very often, he would have made the shooting script beforehand. I remember the first time I saw Mr. To shooting a movie. It was Fat Choi Spirit. I felt I was watching a performance. There were two or three cameras on the set. His arrangement, the placement of the cameras, the setting, or the movement of the cameras. It was like he was performing magic. Mr. To had a scene-by-scene outline and knew the sequence and synopsis of each scene, but wasn't clear about the changes and details designed by the screenwriters. I would assist him on the set. He'd ask me if he had any questions. After he talked to him-- This part isn't necessary. Neither is this part. It's set in Hong Kong. -Let him talk towards the camera. -Zero double three. Draw a mark for Dave Wang to find the correct position. Nai-hoi Yau might be the one who gained the most experience from me and Mr. Wai. He has gained a lot of useful things from our cooperation. I also told Mr. Wai that I believe Yau must be the future leader of Milkyway Image. If you can stay with Milkyway Image and I think you have potential, I will endeavor to help you improve. Cut. One more time. Also, don't throw your gun like that. You were just tossing it. With Milkyway Image, I have made... two movies. One is Motorway, and the other is Accident. Both went over budget. I am grateful to Mr. To. because, imagine how many producers there are who will allow you to take such a long time to produce a movie? Did the boss never press? I don't think so. Was it cheap? It was at least 10 million dollars. What about that? Pressure is inevitable. I was lucky because the boss wouldn't directly push me. Instead, he would ask Johnnie To how much longer it would take. Take Punished for example. It wasn't a co-production and I knew when I shot it that it would lose money. Such a low-budget movie has no chance of being shown in mainland China. It could only be introduced there as a foreign film and the title had to be changed. Wasn't he under pressure? His pressure was how to cope with the boss. Even if there are directors like me, it is him alone who holds up the whole Milkyway Image, rather than us. We should let the younger generations seek the future. We should support them to create their own film styles. HONG KONG ARTS DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL FIRST MEETING, 27 JAN 2011 Mr. Johnnie To. There is no need to introduce him, right? I am a director. I have taken the office for two terms, and this year will be the third term. I hope I can go through this term happily and peacefully. There are three government representatives. I proposed the "Fresh Wave" program on the first day I entered ADC. Because when I went to schools to attend some events, there were always students asking me how to enter the film industry after graduation. After several years, I still got the same questions. So I think that's a problem. So I hope that colleagues in the film industry can give young people more opportunities. In the next five to ten years, we need to establish a local Hong Kong culture and a local Hong Kong film industry. I would encourage people not to think about co-production with mainland China first, but to do real Hong Kong movies. But development of the film industry needs support from the whole society. Hong Kong cinema is not only an industry, but also Hong Kong's postcard and trademark. I was talking with him yesterday about how we can continue doing this work. We never think it can be done in one or two years. We think it requires a long-term effort. Because we are learning about the changes in the world and how to communicate with young people. What I want to do is unlikely to be accomplished in just a few years. We need at least a decade to produce the initial results. So I have made a significant promise. If I can't really do it well, I'd better not waste time. This year is my last term and I should have worked on the program for nine years when this term ends. We are going to discuss detailed issues in later sessions. We will elect the committee members and decide the personnel in charge of certain fields. If you are absent, it will be hard for you to reverse the decisions made. So you need to weigh them yourself. Actually, there is no need for you to attend the meeting today. Yes. But out of politeness, I needed to introduce myself to everybody. Often, nothing important can be achieved in the first meeting. But you have to be courteous, so the head of ADC is here too. It isn't difficult to have that idea, what's difficult is to really carry it out. That's the hardest thing. He is working on the program of Fresh Wave, and other things. He is willing to shoulder this responsibility to cultivate the younger generation and also to pillar the company. To be honest, I've heard people say had he not taken on so much responsibility, his life would be much easier and unfettered. Why does he have to look after us? Without us, he could focus on filmmaking out there with much less burden. I remember I went to Hong Kong once right at the time of the award ceremony of the "Fresh Wave" program. He said, "Come, Jia, do us a favor and attend the ceremony." Not long ago, I met him and he gladly said that he was going to take some works of young directors to Udine FEFF. I think he is very happy when he works with young people or helps them. I really admire him for that. He isn't doing all this for his public image, really. As a director who loves cinema and talent, he enjoys helping these young people. Please welcome Ms. Hau-yee Yan, vice-chairman of ADC. I will try my best to do the things that I can do, such as Fresh Wave. I'll keep working on it for the rest of my life. Thank you. Mr. To, please wait a minute. Nick Cheung, you haven't said anything. If you want me to say something, I will. I don't know if it's okay to say that. Come on! I just said to him on the stage that, Mr. To, other than making movies, I haven't seen you care about anything else so much. I saw he was busy arranging things everywhere today. He is not young anymore and it's really not easy. So we really should thank him a lot! When we first started the Fresh Wave program, people all thought poorly of the younger generations in Hong Kong. I, myself, also had doubts. I was also discouraged, until colleagues in ADC worked together to promote the program. And after two or three years, there were indeed some achievements. I might tell you, even if ADC says there are no funds for Fresh Wave, I will try my best to raise money for it. So please don't give up. Just as Ms. Sylvia Chang said, inevitably, there will be sacrifice. But we will see whether there is hope afterwards. Although many have said that Hong Kong movies are done for, that Hong Kong movies have lost their glory, and some even say Hong Kong movies are dead, I still don't think so. My opinion is, how can they possibly die? Even if there's only one movie left, Hong Kong movies still exist. Besides, people in different times have different experiences. Although we lost the Great China market, we still have the Hong Kong market of seven million people. It doesn't mean we can't make films, or our younger generations have lost the film industry. It's not lost. Hong Kong movies are still there. But the problem is in what ways the younger generations will make movies, and how they can create their own movie world. I am against opportunistic filmmaking, to be specific, movies like Sex and Zen in 3D, or some movies full of foul words. I'm absolutely averse to it. Movie shouldn't be used that way. The movie culture and industry shouldn't take this direction. Hong Kong movies, even at their worst, should not choose this road. I respect people who give really honest creations. He's the one who comes from a production background and respects creation the most. To be honest, I have always told people I am still learning how to make movies because I still have a lot to work out. Talking further about the artistic level is really beyond my knowledge. Because when I entered the industry, I just wanted to find a job. I'm not well-cultured in history and literature. I'm not one of those type of directors. I am a director that's good at handling situations. It might have something to do with the environment I grew up in. So I was able to make PTU. Just a uniform. No need to buy other costumes. No continuity problems for the actors. I would think about these practical issues first. Besides, the worlds that I've created in movies are not real. For example, The Mission, how can bodyguards carry guns in the real Hong Kong? I just imagine it like a world of adventure. I think it works too. I'm not saying that I won't make such movies anymore, but if I keep doing so, my movie world will be really limited and narrow. When I ask you questions, answer, "I understand completely." I understand completely. Thank you, Kun, for choosing our bank's product. She has chosen Wealth Co. Unit Trust. Risk evaluation is high. Your subscription is one million Hong Kong dollars. The bank will charge a two percent fee, which is 20,000. Why a fee? I should think about what a realistic world would be, from the aspects of our real life and literature. I haven't engaged myself in that. I started out making TV series for TVB, most of which fall in the adventure genre, or at least the action genre. It's time for me to change, say, to read more, before I look back to the real world. I should think about whether I can find a different path here. He is still pursuing and keeps learning. I can tell his improvement throughout these years. I mean it. Go down. I'm screwed. I think one thing I didn't do well in Life Without Principle is I wasn't bold enough to tell the story without being too dramatic. Though I kept trying to make the whole story not that dramatic, it didn't really work out in the end. Faster! Faster! Even a blind man can be faster than you. Alright. Okay. Though I keep saying I am learning filmmaking, I still haven't figured it out completely. Having been a filmmaker for many years, I still haven't mastered the art. Since I am still learning, why not pursue a different route of filmmaking, one which I really have a clear understanding about? When I first entered TVB, I told myself I could forget about pursuing a film career if I couldn't make it to assistant TV director in four years. Surprisingly, I was promoted to assistant director within two years. So I aimed to be a TV director in four years. I did it again. The next dream was to make films, and I set the same timeframe, and surprisingly, I did that two years later with The Enigmatic Case. It seems everything went smoothly. However, it wasn't until my first film that I realized that being a director isn't the same as I imagined. It's not simply working your way up to that position as I did. A director must have a clear notion of film. Don't set the other camera too far away. That's why I always say these films, from The Mission, PTU, Breaking News, Exiled, to Sparrow, they were all practice. I try new ideas with each movie. And discovered a whole new territory. The 1997 Johnnie To was different to what I later became, because I hadn't really blazed my own trail, creation-wise. It seems everything is destiny. I have to stay in Hong Kong since I hadn't explored other areas. Stay in a place like Hong Kong, under this system, and breed my own film career. I remember something interesting. During the screening of PTU in 2003, we met the chairman of a film festival. He really loved Hong Kong movies and he had a profound understanding of Hong Kong movies. He said that the element he was most delighted to see wasn't the action, but those scenes Director To shot, such as the site of the gun fight scene, and the China cafe. He said, though To shoots action films, these films can always present an authentic Hong Kong, and capture the essence of Hong Kong, which he had never seen from other filmmakers' movies. Actually, China Cafe is the kind of tea restaurant peculiar to Hong Kong. It represents a certain aspect of life in Hong Kong. I feel that China Cafe is really where we belong when we go there. A place where we can talk comfortably. Mr. To likes to show the whole environment within one shot. That environment alone could tell the daily lives of the cops in that film. I remember watching one of To's films, Election I or II, I'm not sure, with my assistant cameraman who grew up in Beijing. I remember one scene where they fought in a coffin store. My assistant cameraman grew up in Beijing and had never been to Hong Kong. He had never seen a coffin store as only cremation is allowed in Beijing. There are no coffin stores. I believe by choosing such a unique space, Mr. To totally caught the soul of Hong Kong. LOK HAU FOOK RESTAURANT WELCOME In these old areas, you live a close life with passengers around. You feel close with other people even if you look down from upper stairs. Even when all the shops are closed, you can still tell their unique character. What impressed me most when I went to Hong Kong is its antiquity. I had seen Hong Kong's pictures before, when you arrive at Yau Ma Tei, with shop signs in traditional Chinese over your head. Newspapers are in traditional Chinese, too. Especially with that picture of life, it reminds me of how the late Tsing Dynasty citizens looked. When I talked about that with Acheng later, he said, "Exactly! The feeling of the late Tsing Dynasty!" Because it hasn't been influenced by the Republic of China. Because it was ceded to Britain in late Tsing and became a colony, without going through the Republic of China, or People's Republic of China phase. To some extent, I like the old architecture. I think modern architecture is kind of cold and distant. It doesn't have any sense of humanity. I always have my eyes on things from the 1950s and 1960s. At first, Sparrow was only about thieves. But the demolishing of the Star Ferry Pier really made me very sad. Star Ferry, the pier with a history of almost half a century, will be relocated after the last ferry leaves on Saturday. The pier that has served Hong Kong for almost half a century will be shut down. Star Ferry was put into use in 1958. Protestors broke into the pier that was to be demolished in the late afternoon. They destroyed the lock and broke into the pier. Why push Hong Kong people like this? Why does the government never take ordinary people's lives into account? Why don't they give us something we really want in our daily lives? It's fine to improve the public transport in Hong Kong, but was demolishing Star Ferry the only solution? I felt upset and sad at that time. Filmmakers like us, are often attacked when we stand out for our opinions. Most people in the film industry today, for the sake of survival, or protecting ourselves from persecution, choose to swallow our grudges. This is totally different from what we were like before the return of Hong Kong. I cannot condemn them, as I am one of them. To some extent, we are not politicians at all, just ordinary citizens. However, I do think we can express ourselves, and one of the ways is through filmmaking. We, filmmakers, can use films as weapons because films offer us such kind of freedom and rights. I often emphasize that filmmakers are responsible, for both the society and the age we are living in. I'm voting for Lok. The background of Election, is that elections were introduced into Hong Kong, or Hong Kong was at the critical point of facing fake elections. The society he depicted in Election was also a political mode with fake elections. He used this to reflect reality. From our perspective, the most important things we wanted to depict in Election is that Hong Kong went through that era and then entered 1997, and settled in the era with or actually without direct elections. The most ironic thing is that... even the triad societies have a long history of elections, why doesn't Hong Kong have that? Election was made about ten years after the return of Hong Kong, I feel lots of things have changed. Those changes are something we never expected. For example, I wouldn't have known that Chun-ying Leung would be the Chief Executive in five years, or Chee-hwa Tung would resign. Lots of things in your daily life have become uncertain, which brings people to feel unsettled. We have never felt settled. CHUN-YING LEUNG SHOULD STEP DOWN That's bound to happen. You totally go against the people. The government never realized it's only a service entity for the people. The only value we should preserve is law. The law should never be changed randomly, or modified to meet some individuals' interests. This is the universal value. Respecting democracy and law are the foundations of a city. These are the things, I believe, that should never be challenged. Otherwise people will lose their values, which is most damaging of all. So if there is only a bleak future for Hong Kong ahead, and people are deprived of their basic rights of living a peaceful life, we will face some serious issues. I want a mansion here. A three-story one. Second floor will have three rooms. One room is for us. One for a lawyer, and one for a doctor. Our children will become doctors or lawyers someday. What do you say? These two scenes send the same message. His family. Everything of his, including his career, or even the whole era wasn't there then. Everything starts from zero. You can only see a vast field, which could change drastically once some movement or call arises. These two fellas, Yong You and Louis Koo, decided to set the whole rule, starting from zero. I do not intend to judge the fair or foul of this government, or that of this transition. All I want to say is that human beings could be crushed by the environment in one second, or to be more precise, the environment we are in decides our destiny more than ourselves. We have another request. From this day on, the Baton will stay in your family. What do you mean? We respect the election system. But when your term is up, we don't want any little punks like your Godfather upsetting the social order. You want to turn WoSing into a family enterprise? -Will my son inherit the Baton? -We can trust you. Your family will own WoSing. You and I will work hand in hand. No! My term expires in two years! I'm just a businessman! I don't want to be a gangster! I don't want to be a gangster! Forget about the logistic center! Forget about my business in China! It has been five or six years since we finished Election II. You can see that all the rich are more or less similar to the main character Jimmy. They never dare to say no to the central government. He has some really poignant and critical observations that in the history of China, or at least in its modern history, the politics in China is like a triad society. This includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Definitely, China. Definitely, Taiwan. Unfortunately, Hong Kong has also entered the Triad politics era. I am not sure whether Hong Kong will develop into what we talked about in Election II. Thank you. Thanks for your cooperation. The return of Hong Kong in 1997 is a major historical event. It was really a watershed for both Hong Kong and mainland China. How much did the seven million HK people understand at that time? I think, nothing. But we do realize something after all these years. Probably, we could understand better in ten more years. You will never understand the process until you really go through it. This is era. What I'm saying is that, we can never find the solution for something until we really experience it. I do not dare to criticize too much on current policies implemented in Hong Kong by the Chinese government. Because it absolutely has the right to do anything it believes is right as a sovereign and central government. The problem here is, can't it govern in a better, more balanced manner? On the other hand, HK people are partly responsible for this outcome. We didn't seize the opportunities. From my own perspective, I do think that in the past years, we HK people were not always doing the right things. Certainly, calling for democracy and freedom is always the right thing. I believe that as long as we are doing our jobs at our best, the future will come naturally. For example, professionals like doctors, nurses, and engineers, they all have their own professional capabilities. Our capability is filmmaking, so let's facilitate the development of the society through filmmaking. We should go. We should go. -You have over 400,000. -The pool is 500,000. One more game. Bet it all! This is the decisive round! Let's see your hand! Stop! Thief! Go after them! The main character has lost everything. He was gambling for the sake of gambling, and he wanted to bankrupt himself. He was so desperate. But when he saw the woman steal the money and run away, that silly mettle made him feel somehow his life was different. So as I gave Louis Koo direction for his running scene, he might not have really understood. Of course, plenty of people still don't. I told him to laugh while running. He didn't really understand how he should laugh or why, as a result, his acting didn't clearly reflect that kind of feeling. When we met after the film was finished, we used to talk about this scene. Mr. To wanted to show a sense of liberation in this scene. This character was under great pressure. He had a potential problem, but he wasn't willing to liberate himself. He had no choice but to paralyze himself by gambling and drinking. When he saw Mona, played by Cherrie Ying, running, it was like the sun shining on him, making him feel there was hope in life. He laughed, not only because of her running postures, but because it reflected a release of soul. His life was enlightened with hope again. Actually, there is another scene with the same theme. That is when Cherrie Ying, Aaron Kwok and I ride on each other's shoulders to chase after the red balloon. Because that's the thing with eras. I believe you've got to change yourself with the times, no matter what, but the world and theory of film has never changed. No. You have to give him some more light. If you block it out, the reflection won't look good. -Ready. -Ready. Play the film clip. SEVEN YEARS LATER I think Romancing in Thin Air is really a personalized work. I even believe this is his most romantic film. He announces to the world unashamedly that he loves movies. He is so determined in his announcement. Just like how people propose to their girlfriends in a plaza, making a grand gesture. Just like that. I have never found this feeling in any other Hong Kong film before. There's even one line in this film, said by Louis Koo, which is... I really love films. Indeed you can see most of his life is about film, even when he is not producing films. Like how he promoted the Fresh Wave, giving some young people a lift, or the fact that he doesn't like to keep his awards in his house. Because he believes that these awards belong to all the people who worked with him, and to the cinema. He often thinks that what we've gained from the cinema should be given back to it. Now you can see his passion for cinema. He is still pursuing it, and to him, cinema is the most important thing in his life. I am lucky, I am grateful to God for giving me this job. Filmmaking not only improves my livelihood, but also provides me with more opportunities to understand humanity. Hence, this career is not only something that feeds me, but it's more a way of better understanding humanity and life. Thanks. Really. I am so lucky. As long as I'm still capable of making films, I will continue to do so until my body can't afford to. That would be the best ending for me. Three million Hong Kong dollars. If we didn't buy it-- -It is more convenient to-- -Let's discuss this. When I did editing myself before, there was film hanging everywhere, which I really enjoyed. Some may think that was really messy. When you look for a certain take, it's really hard to find one roll of film from more than ten boxes. Or if you are trying to find one particular scene not marked clearly in your notebook, you must look through all the boxes, and you may still fail even after a thorough search. By then, half an hour would have been wasted. Now you just press a button, and you can see all the frames, which makes things more convenient. However, I lost the passion for editing when digital editing started to prevail. And I don't know why. I started to ask my staff to do the editing. For me, digital stuff seems soulless. If you ask me whether I like this kind of change or not, I would definitely say no. But that's impractical. So how to cope with it? One should again start from zero, as if I am back to square one in the TV world, like deja vu. We should really look into the infinity of film, and that's why I painfully decided to quit using film recently. I'm using both! The director's going to cut the cake! One! Two! Three! Happy birthday! Every time Mr. To goes to karaoke, he likes to sing a particular song. You really like Beyond's songs! I can sing with you! But how are we going to sing without lyrics? I don't have the lyrics with me now. We'll sing with you. -We'll guide you. -Okay, but-- Tonight I saw snow falling from the sky With a deadened heart I set off on a long journey Hustling in the rain I barely make out my way in the mist Will we ever change under a vast sky Forgive me for being wild And yearning for freedom Yet fearing someday I might fall down To give up one's dream It isn't hard to anyone Never mind if someday There's only you and me
