He decided to go to Belize with his new wife. So a friend of mine offered us her condo here. Soften the blow a little. She keeps saying that but it's probably because we haven't spent a Christmas at home since Dad left. Danielle, you're exaggerating. No I'm not. We always spend Christmas somewhere else.

No problem. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Hi. Come on guys. This is going to be so much fun. Hey, wait here a minute okay? Watch your brother. May I call up to a guest room please? Thank you. Thank you for calling the Fairmont Chateau Whistler Resort. How may I direct your call? Scott McGuigan's room, please. One moment please. Oh, it looks like that guest checked out. Checked out, when? About two hours ago. My name is Olivia Young. Did... did he leave me a message? No, I'm sorry, no message. Okay, thanks. ( sighs ) Okay guys, change of plans. Why, where is Hayes? And her dad? They had to leave, some family emergency. But it's Christmas and we, the three of us, we're going to have an awesome day. Right? Awesome! Okay, get your stuff. Come on, let's go. It's going to be fun, come on! Good morning. Good morning. Olivia! Good morning. Good morning. Olivia. Morning, Kim. Your office, now. Is there a problem? When you started last month, did I mention the Fort Wilcox toy drive? It's our outreach program, your predecessor took care of it and now it's in your hands. Oh, okay. In December, it is this bank's public face. It's now your primary focus. And if Fort Wilcox is happy, our board is even happier. This will be your liaison at Fort Wilcox, Sergeant McGuigan. I'm telling you the truth! Oh really. In this day of cloud computing and wireless backups and SIM cards, you actually expect me to believe that my phone number got completely lost in the ether? I had a flip phone! You saw it, there's no cloud backups with those! I didn't know if you were okay, or if you just stood me up. I mean, I thought we were having a good time in Whistler. We were having a great time in Whistler. And I didn't know if you didn't get my note or if you stood me up! But I still tried to find you. Oh, you did? Yeah, do you know how many Olivia Young's there are in Los Angeles? Young is my maiden name. I go by my ex-husband's last name Roberts for the house... the kids. Oh... of course. Look, I feel awful that you think that I flaked on you. Can we just throw all that out and start fresh? When'd you guys move here? Uh, about a month ago. My sister Heather lives here. Oh. Remember those jobs I was applying for? Sure. This is the one I really wanted. So your Christmas wish came true? Mmm... not all of it. Well what was the rest of it? Oh, we don't tell our Christmas wishes until after they come true. Olivia... I'm a soldier. And when I get orders, I obey them. Even on Christmas Day. Look... we're going to be working together a lot on this. That is still an open question. Well... if you decided that you want to be a part of it then you know how to reach me. And now you know how to reach me. ( phone ringing ) This is unbelievable! I mean... why doesn't this stuff ever happen to me? Did he say if he has a girlfriend? Did he mention it? I didn't ask, he didn't tell. Ugh... I'm not interested in a relationship. You know what? Sometimes I just want to throw something at you! ( Laughter ) I didn't mean to hit you in the face, I'm sorry. Yeah right. Is Danielle still mad at you for dragging her up here from L.A.? For putting her in a new school right before Christmas, for ruining her entire life? Yeah. Teenagers, so dramatic. There was no one as dramatic as you. Don't worry about her, she'll be fine. Why can't I? Because you're too young to stand in line all night to buy a video game! Kelly's mom is letting her go. Oh, wait! Kelly's in L.A. and we're here. How could I forget? I guess that just proves that Kelly's mom loves her more. Or does that mean she loves her less? You're not funny. I'm a little bit funny. No, you're not. Danielle? Charlie? Hayes! Wow! I thought I'd never see you again! This is so random! Do you like, live around here? Yes! Really? Didn't your mom tell you? She saw my dad this morning. Hi Hayes, nice to see you honey. My dad said you never got his note. Ahh, the infamous Olivia Young. Infamous? I was involved in the great Olivia Young search. There was a search? I'll explain. I'm Jill McGuigan, Scott's mother. Pleasure to meet you. He felt awful about leaving Whistler like that. But orders come when they come, it's the army life. Yeah he, he told me today. That must be difficult. I've never thought of it that way. My father was a soldier, my husband, my son... I'm proud of them all. Of course! Well I'm glad that he found you finally. Anyway... I'm just... Come on Hayes! We have to go check out. Here. Lovely to meet you. You as well. Come on, Hayes. Bye Hayes! Okay, okay. I saw Sergeant McGuigan at the bank... he's the liaison for this outreach program I'm doing. I didn't tell you guys because... Because you hated him. No, I don't! Because you're mad at him. Well, I was... Well... he tried to find you. He left you a note. Doesn't that mean something? It does, but it's complicated. We need bananas, and apples. You already have apples. Well then oranges. Come on. Alright. No, I'm getting bananas! Punk! ( laughs ) ♪ Repeat the sounding joy. ♪ Repeat the sounding joy. ♪Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.♪ Oh, toy drive. Oh don't worry, it fills up as we get closer to Christmas. With used toys? Oh no, no! Newer ones too. We collect all sorts of toys from local branches, enough to fill a warehouse! The base liaison handles distribution, it's quite the undertaking. Where are you going? We can do better. These are the ground rules, Sergeant McGuigan. Our relationship remains strictly professional. This is going to be more than merely a toy drive. So we have 23 days to get this done and I intend to make this the biggest and best event Fort Wilcox and Coastal National Bank have ever had. So, I hope you're up for it. Are you going to say anything? Sounds like a big effort. Christmas used to mean something to me, I want that back. Do you know why I joined the army? To serve your country, I suppose? Yes, proudly, but it's more than that. I like the feeling of being a part of something bigger than myself. That's why I like the glaciers so much. Is that why you're a liaison on this? Christmas is important to these families and I just want to be able to help. So yes, Olivia Young... also known as Olivia Roberts... I am up for it. Okay. You know, Hayes was so excited to see your kids at the store. Mine were too. Hard to believe they get so attached after just one day. Okay, so Christmas trees. I thought we were going to the Christmas tree lot. We are, I just have to do a few things first. What exactly do you do here, in the army? Part of a unit, the Army Rangers. We are... on call, always. Wherever we go isn't discussed, nor is what we do. Olivia... the army and my unit, my country and my family... it's all part of the same mix for me. Hello! Oh, Scott! When I called you this morning I said there was no rush! Hey, you send out an SOS, I show up... with help. Help, what? Becky Fowler, Olivia Young. Nice to meet you. You too! Ooh! This little guy's a kicker! Aww! At least Joe will be home soon. It's our first. Olivia's in charge of the toy drive this year. It's going to be more than that. Awesome! Well thank you, this looks great! And I love the lights outside! When Joe gets back, he's going to be so thrilled. Um... Scott, I baked some cookies. I put a dozen in each bag for the two of you. Can you go grab them? Sure. I heard about you, last Christmas... Whistler... He felt really bad about it all. You know about that? Yeah, my brother's in the same unit. Got called away just like that and they didn't come back until after New Year's. Wait, so do you really never know anything about where they're going or why? I've learned to connect the dots. Do you remember those hostages in Syria? They were rescued and reunited with their families at the White House on New Year's day? Oh... yeah, I saw it on the news. Happy reunion, everyone in tears. I mean, I was crying and I just watched it on TV. It takes a pretty special team to go in there and do something like that. Are you saying Scott and your brother...? It's never discussed, no public recognition. No press conferences. They're the heroes no one knows about. Grabbed an extra bag for your lazy brother but I swear, he might not get any of them. ( Laughter ) Hi! Come on in. Oh, hey Sarah. Hey! Is that Joey? This is, uh, my neighbor Sarah and her son Joey. I look after him sometimes when she teaches yoga. This is Olivia with the toy drive! Hi. She's helping the kids get toys this year. Do you know Santa? Well... Can you tell him I don't want any toys, I just want my daddy home for Christmas. Hey... we're going to Skype with dad when I get home, okay? Okay. Nice to meet you, Olivia. Bye guys. When does his father get back? We don't know. Two thirds of the base is deployed and the family deployment center is shut down. Budget cuts, so... it's going to be a pretty tough Christmas for the kids. I'm going to try to change that. Sergeant McGuigan... let's give them a proper Christmas. Yes ma'am. Thank you for coming. Oh, please. Enjoy those cookies! Oh don't worry, I will. Thank you. Bye. Tell Paul to stop being so lazy! I will, trust me! Bye guys. Awful! ( Laughter ) Good day! Your sister's cookies. Oh, thank you. Olivia, this is Paul. Hi. Olivia is in charge of the toy drive this year. Oh great, well if you need help with anything just ask. Perfect, thank you! Hey, did you get my text? Captain wants you at S.R. Intel even though you're down. Copy that. Alright. And your sister says stop being so lazy. ( Laughter ) Nice to meet you. You too. So I guess I can't ask how he broke his leg, can I? Sure, playing basketball. Is that the truth? Paul's an unbelievable soldier. I'd trust him with my life, but not on a basketball court. This is where he broke his leg, in this gym. Okay? What you do, what you don't talk about, doesn't scare you? Of course it does, but I don't let it stop me. And I do talk about it, just not out loud. You know, I have this place that I go that helps me sort some things out. I'll show you, maybe you'd like it. I come here before and after every mission, and sometimes in between. It's been a long time since I've been in a church. What if I don't... really believe anymore? Well... we all go for different reasons. We don't have to go in if it makes you uncomfortable.

I know you like him. Have some fun! God, you can be so boring sometimes. Don't you have homework to do? Has he asked you out? No! And I'm too busy anyway. Hey... so, you're not mad at me anymore for making this move? No, I'm not mad. I'd like if we could spend Christmas at home this year like a real family. I like this house. Are you ever going to finish unpacking? ( laughs ) ( Announcement ) The trees are moving fast folks, get them soon before they sell out. It's for the soldiers and their families. I mean, many can't afford trees. We want to surprise them for Christmas. Don't you think we owe them that at least at this time of year? And in return, I will put up signage for your business... in every local branch of the Coastal National Bank. And, and have each one of our tellers say... Can I say something? Yes of course, please. How many families are we talking here? As many as you can help with. It's a lot of free publicity and good karma. Do you know how many people come into our branches every day? And just imagine the smiles on those kids' faces. Okay, okay, okay! Let me check my inventory, see if there's something I can do. Thank you! Here's our contact info. Great, thanks. I look forward to your call. Okay, moving on. Grocery stores, toy stores, department stores... Sergeant, let's go! Hey, this is a pretty big operation you've got there in your head, isn't it? Operation Christmas, very good. I like that! Hey Mom... You hear back from them? Your mom said Hayes needed help with something at exactly this time. Is Hayes always so specific? Yes. Yes... But my mom sounded strange. Something's going on. Whoa! Charlie... what are you guys up to? Madam, sir... please come in. ( Laughter ) Oh... Oh! This is amazing. Welcome to Christmas dinner in Whistler. Your coats please. So much work. One, two, thank you. Good evening. I'll be escorting you to your table. I can't believe it. Look what they've done. Yeah, it's pretty sweet. The best spot in Whistler. ( whispers ) Don't be boring. I won't. Please... have a seat. ( Laughter ) Okay. The menu for this evening. Prepared by our executive chef. Ta-da! Oven roasted turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce, mashed potato... our Christmas special. And for dessert we have Christmas Yule log cake, followed by chocolate dipped strawberries. Come on kids, let's get your coats. Where you guys going? They're showing 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the base auditorium. You two can help yourselves. Thanks Mom. Thank you. Come on, kids! And... bon appétit! This is incredible. Well... to, um... Whistler. Whistler. Oh... that's better. Out of the work clothes? Yes. Oh... You okay? Mmmhmm. Well we've got to admit that the kids set us up pretty brilliantly. Yeah. But an Islanders fan and a Kings fan? Clearly our kids know nothing about the real world. Clearly they know nothing. ( small laugh ) In Whistler I said I wasn't interested in a relationship. Oh, I remember. What about now? Well, I should tell you that I have some issues. Yeah, well... so do I, we all do. I guess. All we really have is the here and now. That's true. Why don't we... do something that we did not get a chance to do in Whistler. What's that? So? How did it go? It was wonderful, romantic... he's so sweet. It's been a long time since I've felt so... Aww, finally! Is this thing straight? Sure. And it felt good. There's just one question that I keep asking myself and I don't want to seem like I'm diving in too soon or jumping to conclusions, but... do you think that I'm up for this army life? It's not for everyone, you know. It's tough. She seems the type of woman who's up for any kind of challenge. Yeah she seems it, but... Give it a minute. She wasn't born to this life the way we were. Come on, Scott. If this is meant to be... You're right. Thanks Mom. Mmm! Playing it safe gets you nowhere. I mean look at me. I wanted to be a singer, remember? Oh in high school you were a star and then in college... Oh I chickened out, I played it safe! That is how this drama queen ended up working at a life insurance company. Oh, man... but if I could just sing again... that would be the dream. Well then you will sing again. Sing for me! Okay. Uh... Christmas carol? Perfect!

My daughter's school choir rocks, my sister has an amazing voice... I'm not so bad on the piano. And I'm really good at telling people what to do! ( Laughter ) Okay, you're my assistant. See, there must be dozens of people on base who have all sorts of different talents. Christmas carols, skits, dancing... pure holiday joy. Well? At least it's something we can do while we're waiting to see if these stores or Christmas trees actually come through. And, I'd like this show to be a fundraiser. A fundraiser? Yeah. To raise funds to reopen the Family Deployment Center. I'll talk to General Holt, but... I like it. Count me in. Me too. Thanks guys. I love it! I can't imagine General Holt saying no. That guy sings in a barbershop quartet, he's a great baritone. So, you're in? Olivia, I'm married to a soldier... of course I'm in. I hope we can pull it off. What's this I hear you have getting stores to donate? Ugh... we have spent the week begging, imploring, cajoling... and every single place has had an excuse. Yeah, it's the economy or they already support this cause, or that cause. It just feels like we've hit a wall. I've never hit a wall that could stop the army. My BFF Ann, from college... her dad owns Kramers. The department store! Yes! Clothes, shoes, toys, all made right here in our beautiful state. Can you call your friend now? I sure can. Hey Sarah! Ann, you're on speaker phone. Hey Ann! Let's talk Operation Christmas. I'm listening. Let's hear it. Shopping carts of food, bags of clothes for every family on base, toys galore! Big wow. Sarah is amazing. You're amazing! Oh please, what Sarah did... She wouldn't have done any of that if it wasn't for you. That's the truth, so can you please take a compliment? If I was so amazing, then Mr. Sweeney from the Christmas tree lot would've returned at least one of my dozen phone messages. Um... it's probably more like two dozen. ( Laughter ) I like this... us. Yeah. Nobody's around... Mmm! Hey guys. Hey Mom, what's up? Hey guys! Hey Scott! You did it! Hey, uh, you Sergeant McGuigan? Yeah. Mr. Sweeney says Merry Christmas. Are you Mrs. Young? Yes. Mr. Sweeney says stop calling! ( Laughter ) He also says you can't have a tree without all the trimmings. Oh... Another three trucks on the way. That's great. Enjoy! Thank you. Thank you. This is fantastic! Now will you take a compliment? It's amazing, you are amazing. Oh, they are going to be so happy. It has been a fantastic day. You were right... I was?

No... no it's not. But what it's taught me is to live in the moment. All we really have is the here and now... so let's make the most of that. And tomorrow? You okay, sweetie? Yeah... just wondering if you were okay. Oh honey, I'm fine. Come here. It's just been a long day, you know? Yeah. What are you singing in choir? I can sing it if you want. Yeah, I'd like that. ♪ Angels we have heard on high, ♪ ♪ sweetly singing o'er the plains. ♪ ( Both ) ♪ And the mountains in reply, ♪ ♪ echoing the joyous strains. ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ in excelsis Deo. ♪ Gloria ♪ in excelsis Deo. ♪ ♪ Shepherds, why this jubilee? ♪ ♪ Why your joyous strains prolong? ♪ ♪ What the gladsome tidings be ♪ ♪ Which inspire your heavenly song? ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ in excelsis Deo. ♪ Gloria ♪ in excelsis Deo. These past few days felt like a military operation. Couldn't have done it without all those guys you enlisted. We've done everything! Trees, lights, gifts, food! And now we have a show to put on. You done good. We did good. Listen, I'm probably going to have to leave soon. So we should maybe celebrate Christmas early. Are you saying you're not going to be back for Christmas? I'm saying I don't know. Or you can't say, won't say, don't say. No, don't make this harder than it already is. I'm just confused, okay? I don't know how to feel... and I don't want you to go. I'll be back. Um... I should get home. Yeah. What about our early Christmas? I'll talk to the kids. Ok. Good day. Sergeant McGuigan invited... Mom... his name's Scott. Okay... well Scott invited us to... I know, Hayes already texted us. Early Christmas at their place. Well how do you feel about that? Charlie and I think it's cool, we get to celebrate Christmas twice. How do you feel about it? Mom, seriously... everything has a risk. Is he worth it? I say yes. And I also say that it's okay to be scared... it just means you care. There's more laundry in the dryer, please. And when did you grow up? Oh, you've done it now. I have? ( clears throat ) And you can donate at any branch of the Coastal National Bank to support the troops and their families at Fort Wilcox... give them the best Christmas ever! Let's get the family deployment center back up and running. Coastal National Bank will match every dollar donated. This is Operation Christmas. So, Coastal National Bank will match every dollar donated? You said if you were out to email the president, so I did. He liked the idea, gave me the go ahead... I CC'd you on all correspondence. Oh yes, I read all the emails. General Holt called the president of the bank to thank him himself. That's good, right? The Family Deployment Center helps soldiers transition between here and there and back again, all while supporting the families during deployment. General Holt started it 15 years ago. To have it back would mean everything to him. So I suppose it's only a matter of time before you become a manager... well isn't that why you're doing this? No, actually... everyone at Fort Wilcox is so selfless. All they do is give... they deserve a special Christmas. Hmm... You know something? Okay. I like you. This is Scott. Leave me a message. That's not how you... show me how to use chopsticks. No... Like that... Yes, twist it. And you want to flip it up in one motion. Perfect! Mom, are you okay? It's time we finished unpacking. Right now? I jumped into all this stuff at Fort Wilcox and our own house is still in disarray. Okay, Olivia... I need to feel like this is home. So tonight, we are going to finish getting this place ready for the holidays. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Home for Christmas! But, I thought we were going to Sergeant M's for Christmas. Oh... honey, we are. Early Christmas, we are. But he's leaving soon and we need to say goodbye. I don't want to say goodbye to Sergeant M. Me neither, but it's his job. It's what he does. So... everybody get a box. Here, let me take this little guy. This is not your size... I have to ask... how do you do this? Faith... keeping positive, other army wives and husbands. There's strength in numbers, you know. I don't think I have it in me to deal with army life. You guys are all so much stronger than me. But Olivia, I can see that you love him. This life is so much different than I've ever known. I would drive him crazy. He's leaving soon. Rangers don't leave the base to play games. You'll be on his mind, you need to talk to him. ♪ Away in a manger ♪ No crib for a bed... What time did Scott say he was going to be here? Soon, he's just running a little late. He'll be here soon. Can we stop for a second? I was hoping for something, I don't know, a little more upbeat. How about "The 12 Days of Christmas"? Yeah, and then every member of the choir would have a solo and that would take the pressure off me a little bit. That'd be cool. Excellent idea, guys. Would you get them in here and rehearse it? You know Mom, you're pretty good at this. Don't tell anyone but I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. My lips are sealed. Hey Sarah! Hi! You're bringing reinforcements. The cavalry! May I introduce the fabulous Fort Wilcox dancers. Love it. And these guys are what I call all-purpose dancers and singers, whatever we need. Fantastic, thank you. Becky, would you take them over there and assign them numbers? No problem. Then there's me... I've been in six musicals, two dramas, an Agatha Christie mystery and I've even played Tiny Tim when I was little. Sarah, you are extraordinary. So does extraordinary get a solo? You should hear my version of Santa Baby. Done! Yes, thank you! Okay... Sorry I'm late. I can't stay, we have a re-con briefing. How's it going here? Hectic. Yeah, I see that. Yeah. Um... you hear anything? Yeah, we leave tomorrow. It'll be okay. Sorry to interrupt, I need your help. It's the dancers. Go ahead, I have to run anyway. Okay, um... I need to talk to you at some point. And all of a sudden, there he was. Ben... my handsome, wonderful Benjamin. Home two months early... surprise! Of course, I lose it. With all of that mascara running down my face, I looked like a blubbering raccoon. The reunions make it all worthwhile, don't they? I'm so excited for my next one. You'll be having yours real soon. Actually, no. What? Yeah, um... I just found out this morning that Joe and the squadron are staying on for a few more months. Oh Becky, I'm so sorry. I know he was going to be here for the birth. It's okay, I'm just a little emotional right now, so... We'll be here. Thanks. I know I can always count on you gals. Olivia? Olivia? You alright? Oh... yeah. Sorry, just tired. So much on my plate. Operation Christmas, the bank, kids... there should be more hours in the day. You don't need to pretend, Olivia. You're one of us now, we get it. You're worried. Scott's a good man. He deserves the truth. I know. What is it? Whoa! It's a Morse code signal light, come here. Cool! It works! Look. Thanks Sergeant M. You're welcome. Merry Christmas, buddy. And Hayes, I made something special for you. Danielle, phone! Oh! It's an ornament! Look Daddy, it's so pretty! Thank you. You're welcome. Every Christmas Day we get one that has our name and the year on it. Then we put it on the tree. My parents started it with me and my sister so I carried on the tradition with my kids. There's something to be said for tradition. Yeah. Come on Hayes, put it on the tree. Yeah, get a spot. Come on! Oh, that's a good spot. It's beautiful. I love you! I love you too. Merry early Christmas. Merry early Christmas. Well Danielle, you're up! Merry Christmas. It's okay, you can open it. Danielle took it at the glacier last year. It's beautiful. Really, thank you. You're welcome. I don't want this to end. Well neither do I. No Scott, please... let me finish. For our kids... I don't want this to end for them. And they've grown so close, and... I want that to continue. But... I don't have it in me to live this army life. I, I, I... just don't. What, you're ending this? Two Christmases cut short, I mean it just feels like... it wasn't meant to be. I completely disagree. It feels so meant to be. Do you know what I see when I look at you? I see a hero and an amazing man... and I need you to know how much I respect that. But I know what it feels like to be left alone and I can't go back there. I can't be with someone who might have to go at any moment, not knowing where you are, if you're okay or not, if... if you're safe. I just... So you're afraid of the unknown? Life is full of unknowns. I could be a school teacher and get in a car wreck on the way to work, it happens. Scott... It happened. To my wife. And sure, what I do puts me in harm's way a little more, I get that. When I look at you, do you know what I see? I see you. Your kids are happy, you got a new job that you love, new friends, a sense of community... a sense of family... and a guy who's crazy about you. You're going to let, what, fear stop all that? Olivia, what do you need? What can I do? Let us happen. That fear is real for me. I can't. I'm sorry. Mom, come on, you gotta see this! ♪ O holy night. ♪ The stars are brightly shining. ♪ ♪ It is the night of the dear savior’s birth. ♪ ♪ Long lay the world in sin and error pining, ♪ ♪ 'til he appeared ♪ and the soul felt its worth. ♪ ♪ A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices, ♪ ♪ for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. ♪ ♪ Fall on your knees, ♪ oh hear the angel voices. ♪ Oh night divine, ♪ oh night when Christ was born. ♪ ♪ Oh night divine. ♪ Oh night, ♪ oh night divine. ( applause ) Thank you, thank you. And you on the piano, that was fabulous. So, are you single? Okay, well... that is definitely making it in the show. Guys, we still need a finale. Don't I know it? But every idea I've come up with so far... Stinks? That's one way to put it. Well, better decide on something soon. Yeah. Aww, thank you so much for asking me to do that. It was so fun being on stage again. You did so good! Thank you. But there is one thing I have to tell you and it's very important. What? You're an idiot! Everybody can see that you like him. Why can't you? You love Scott. You make it sound so simple. Because it is. No, it's not. Yes it is! No. I went into the church to say goodbye and it tore me up. I don't even know where he's going. To keep us safe. Yeah, by putting himself in danger. I don't know how to live that way. Okay, well hold on a second! So you learn. After your divorce, you just... you put up this wall that even I couldn't deal with and, and then you wanted to bring your kids here and start a whole new chapter. Well, wake up Olivia! This is your new chapter. Do not put up another wall, please. Besides, did you ever consider that maybe you won't lose him? Just saying... So, you're going to deny yourself, and Scott, and the kids' happiness based solely on what if's? On fear? Putting your entire life on hold for something that might never happen? I'm sorry, but that is not my sister. That... that is a coward. And I only say that because I love you. Just think about it. A lot of movement tonight. You should've said something earlier at rehearsal! Well, I didn't want to be a bother. No, seriously! Let's get you to bed. Get you some rest. Yeah. Get off your feet. Yeah... oh! The baby... it's time. Okay, keys... keys? But it's not due for another 10 days! Oh, he doesn't care about that. Okay. Which one is it? Which one is it? Oh... this, this one right here. This one? Okay, okay. Should I call 9-1-1? Yes, call 9-1-1. There won't be time, there won't be time. Oh, okay! We're delivering a baby! Oh... Okay. Okay. Get some hot water. ( Baby cries ) Meet our baby boy! Simon Joseph Fowler. He's incredible! He has your nose! ( laughs ) It's too bad, huh. 10 fingers and 10 toes. He's in perfect health and so am I. I am so sorry I wasn't there, babe. I'm sorry you had to do this on your own. Oh Joe, stop it. I was fine. I had Olivia and Sarah with me. Hi! I know. Can you say hi? Hi Daddy. Oh my God. ( Crying ) Oh, there you are! Come in! A baby boy, how wonderful. Yes, it's a miracle. A Christmas miracle. Here, let me take your coat. Oh, thank you. Come in, come in. I'm exhausted. Oh, I bet you are. Oh... Um... any word from Scott? No, no... we never hear. Come in. You know, uh... I disagree that you don't have it in you, to love a soldier. You just have to choose to do it, that's all. If you're in love, you choose love. That's what my husband and I did and no one ever took that away. I just don't know how. Please... don't run away. When Scott talks about you, his whole face lights up. You should see that. Jill... Yes? Why aren't you afraid for him right now? You think I'm not afraid? I am. So what do you do? I try not to fret over things I can't control, and... if I lose perspective, I find a quiet place and I pray. Hey. I thought you might be here. I love this church. Yeah. It's so peaceful. Hey... I'm an uncle now! Thanks for what you did last night. You're welcome. It was an experience! I wish I was there. With Scott and my unit. I'm a part of them. What if something happens to your unit? They don't come back? You can't think like that. We have a job to do. You going to be okay? Yeah. I finally know what I need, not just what I want. I'll be fine. Charlie? What are you doing? Seeing if Sergeant M gets my message. I miss him. I know, honey. I'm sending him an SOS but he's not answering. We don't know where he is. But he's probably really far away. It might have to be a really strong light to carry a message that far. But if he did see it, he would have to send a message back home, right? Because if he didn't, we wouldn't know he was okay. If he sees it, he'll send a message. I know he will. A message back home. Now I know how to end the show. You're a genius. A genius! But, even a genius needs his sleep. So... let's get to bed. Hey... You know, if you want to marry him... Danielle and I, we're cool with that. Just saying. Sweet dreams. Good night. You too. Good night. Okay, can we get the army drill team in here? Yup. Where are they? Are we really going to pull this off? Olivia, breathe, breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. And again, in through the nose... that's it. We put together a great team, the dance troupe is going to be fabulous. This is not even close to my worst dress rehearsal. It's a great show. Okay. Hey! Sorry, I'm late. You can blame my boss. But I am here now so what can I do for you? Talk me off a ledge. What? You've got a great show, don't worry about anything. No, no, no... not that. I was an idiot about Scott, you were right. Do you think he'll forgive me? Sure. And I'm always right. But you know what? Just relax, let's just put on a show. Okay. Okay. Oh, General Holt... sir. Olivia Roberts. So nice to finally meet you. Thank you for being here. I have a favor to ask you. Would you introduce the finale? I'd be honored. And, uh... we may have a little surprise for you. ♪ God rest ye merry gentlemen, ♪ ♪ let nothing you dismay. ♪ Remember Christ, our savior ♪ was born on Christmas day. ♪ To save us all from Satan's power ♪ ♪ when we were gone astray. ♪ O tidings of comfort and joy, ♪ ♪ comfort and joy. ♪ O tidings of comfort and joy, ♪ ♪ Bump, bump, bump. ♪ God rest ye merry gentlemen, ♪ ♪ let nothing you dismay. ♪ Remember Christ, our savior ♪ ♪ was born upon this day. ♪ To save us all from Satan's power ♪ ♪ when we were gone astray. ♪ O tidings of comfort and joy, ♪ ♪ comfort and joy. ♪ O tidings of comfort and joy, ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy, joy. ♪ Comfort and Joy, hmmm.

And I would like to send out a heartfelt army salute to Ms. Roberts and all the fine folks at Coastal National Bank for doing so much to give these families such a very, very special Christmas. ( applause ) Can we turn the lights up on Ms. Roberts? Where is she? There she is, she's in the booth. Ms. Roberts... Olivia... I wanted to save the best news for last. The bank just informed me that your fundraising campaign was a success and the Family Deployment Center will re-open in the New Year. ( applause ) It's great news! I owe you my personal debt of gratitude, thank you. And now... we have a little bit of a special surprise. Turn the lights on, please.
