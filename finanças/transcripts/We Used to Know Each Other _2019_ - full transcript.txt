- [Amanda] (sighs) Look, I get that it is late there, and this sucks, but this is the only time that I can sit down and do this. - [Hugo] Can you cut me a little slack, just a little? - [Amanda] There's no slack to give. Nothing is slacking. - Just slack me a little. - Please? - I can't. - [Hugo] So you're not mad at me? - No, I'm not mad, I just, can you be honest with me for a second about something? - Can I be honest with you? - It's stupid - I'm always honest with you. - and I can't believe I'm asking you this, but-- - What? (Amanda sighs) Ask. - Is this important to you, like-- - What? - Us, our relationship, is it important to you? - [Hugo] Of course, is that even a question? - Good, 'cause it's important to me too, but that's why we need to stick to routines. Routines are like relationship Gorilla Glue that keep us stuck together. - Oh wow, that's-- - What? - That's, you know, that's, that's very romantic. (scoffs) - Yeah. - What magazine did you pick that up from? - I don't know, Cosmo. - Oh my God, I mean-- - What? - Come on, Cosmo. - But I have read some good articles in Cosmo. - Cosmo's awful. - It is not awful. - So fucking awful. (Amanda laughs) What? - It's not awful. I've read some good articles. - It is awful. I once, look, I once read an article in Cosmo titled 12 Things Your Dog Is Trying to Tell You About Your Man's Sex Drive. (Amanda laughs) I mean, if that's not - Okay, fine. - fucking stupid then you're gonna have to explain it to me, because I don't know what stupid is then, okay. So stop reading Cosmo, please. - I'm not going to, but I get that that article-- - You're not? - That article was stupid, but they have a lot of good articles. - Oh really, I doubt that. - And I get it, okay. It's just, it's all we can do right now. - Why? - I'm just trying to, I'm just trying - I feel like you wanna tell me something - to feel like-- but you're not saying. - I just trying to feel like we're together. - [Hugo] You feel what, sorry? - I just wanna feel like we're together. We're so, you're so far away it's hard to feel like we're even-- - We are together. - No, I mean like in a relationship together. - [Hugo] Look, I'm trying. It's just the Skype thing is a little inconvenient for me, just because of work. - Yeah. - I'm not-- - I get it. - [Hugo] But I'm trying, it's not, don't say it like I'm not trying. - I'm not, I get it, you're trying. - I'm here right now. - Yeah. - What? - Nothing. - [Hugo] So, so what do we do? What do we do now? (gentle music) - [Robert] I mean, yo, it's the desert, man, it's the fucking desert. It's just, - Yeah. - it's hot, it's sweaty, it's like 110 degrees and it's 8:00 a.m. in the morning. - Yeah. - You know, everything here is melting at all times. Everything here is in a constant state of melt. - This is like one minute you're in the middle of everything and then you're kinda like in the middle of nowhere, so it's kinda like, oh shit, what happened, you know what I mean? - I mean, it really works a number on people, that the heat here is enough to turn sane men crazy and crazy men into killers. I feel like when I snap, and I'm going to snap, maybe soon, don't worry, I'm not gonna snap today, okay. I don't have any kinda knife, I'm not gonna stick you. When that thought crosses your mind as a legitimate possibility of your being, you need to start seeking help. I haven't yet, as a matter of fact I'm on no medications whatsoever, but I should be. - Okay. - So don't worry. I tell you what, let's flip the page, let's start anew. I'm Bobby, you can call me Robert. I'd prefer it if you called me Robert. I think it's a much more suitable name for my stature. What's your name? - Hugo. - Hugo, Hugo, where are you from? - I'm from Portugal. - Ah, Portugal. - Yeah. - South America, Argentina, the girl from Ipanema. - No, it's not a city, it's a country in Europe. - You're European? - Yeah. - [Robert] That accent does not sound European at all. - Oh, my girlfriend lives here. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Robert] Girlfriend. - We're at that stage now, we're gonna, decided it was time, we're moving in together. - [Robert] So long-distance thing? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Long term, long distance. Those are two wrongs that do not make a right, my friend. (Hugo laughs) What does she look like? Is she hot, like d'you think I would find her attractive? - Yeah, I don't think I'm comfortable with that question. - C'mon, man, I'm not, you know, I'm a visual guy. When was the last time you guys were like in the States together? - Um, probably 10 months ago. - Ooh. - Yeah. - I'm sorry about that. - Oh, it's okay. - It's a long time to be abstinent. - Yeah. - But hey, man, but seriously, it's gonna be fine. - You think so? - Yeah, no. - You think so? - Yeah, it's totally gonna work out. - Thank you. - Yeah, no, you're on the highway to a successful relationship. (cigarette lighter scratching) (dogs barking) (gate squeaks) (outgoing phone call rings) - Hello? - Oh, hi. - [Amanda] Hi, are you here, did you just land? - I have a surprise for you, I think you're gonna like it. - [Amanda] Hugo, you know I don't like surprises. They make me anxious. - Oh. - What? - Uh-- - What? What is it, just tell me? - I'm, I'm here. - Here-- - I'm outside your window. If you look to your right, yeah. Hey. - Hey, I had the feeling you'd do something like this. (phone beeps) (window scrapes) Ah, I'm soaking wet. Hi. - Hey. - What are you doing here, you told me you were gonna call? - I wanted to surprise you. - I'm all ready to come get you. - You don't look surprised. - I'm very surprised. Trust me, look. - No, you don't look like it. - Look how surprised I am. - You look scared. - Scared? - You hate me. - I don't hate you. I don't hate you, hey, I love you. - Come on, jump out the window. - What? No. - I'll catch you. I'll catch you, I promise. - I'm not gonna jump out the window, no. - If you love me, you'll jump out the window. I'll catch you. - I love you, I just don't think you can catch me. - I'll catch you, please. - Come around the front, okay. - I'll catch you. - Can't let you in the back, the door is stuck. - I'll catch you. - No. - Okay, I'll see you in a bit. - Oh hi, come here. Come here. I missed you. - What? - Nothing. - Look different. - I look different? - Yeah. - In a bad way? - I don't know, kinda look terrified. Yeah. - What? - You look terrified. When I was on top of you, you kinda looked like Leo DiCaprio in The Revenant. You know, the bear part. - I looked like I was getting mauled by a bear? - Uh, a little bit. - Well, it made you come, right, so, hey. - Yeah, pretty quick, (Amanda laughs) so you should feel flattered. You don't? - No, I do. - I did about three hours of Kegels on the plane, too. - Kegels? - Yeah. - I don't think that you have the right equipment for that. - It's in the prostate, it's strengthening the prostate through repetition. - Okay. - The prostate is the key that unlocks the door to the whole male reproductive system. Why are you judging? - Where did you read that? Where did you (laughs) read that? - On, I dunno, a book. - That sounds ridiculous. - I'll show you a photo of one. - Okay, let's do it. (laughs) What happened to your hand, by the way? It looks really bad all wrapped up like that. - It looks bad? No, nothing, I just banged it up a bit, it's fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - It's fine. - Um. - Mm. - On (laughs), on another note, I invited some friends over tonight for dinner. Is that okay? Are you sure? - Yeah. - They're really cool and they're super relaxed. - Hey babe-- - So you don't need to worry. - I'm not worried. - Okay, you just seem kind of upset. - No, I said fine. - Okay, I mean, I told them a lot about you and they're really excited to meet you, so. - Okay, I'm excited to meet them too. What? - Okay. - What were you gonna say? - Nothing, I have to go back to the store in a little bit to get some more ingredients, if you wanna come. - Of course. You don't want me to go? - Are you sure? No, I want you to go, I just want you to know that you can stay and rest if you need to. - I'm fine. I told you that I'm fine. - Okay. - But we're gonna have to have sex again before we leave. - Mm-- - 'Cause I don't think I can move on with my life if we don't. - Okay. - I just can't stop thinking about it. (laughs) You know, let's say I die in the next couple of hours, I don't think I'm gonna be able to pass on to the next life knowing that you'll remember me as a sexual retard. So-- - Okay. - I'm gonna mount you again, pretty soon. - Right now? - 30 seconds. - 30 seconds? - Yeah. - Okay. - Do a countdown. - Countdown to - Yeah. - penetration? (laughs) - To the best sex of your life. - Oh, okay. - Oh yeah. Count. - Okay, 30, 29-- - You need to get excited. You're not excited. - I am. (clears throat) 27, 26. - I can do better. - 25, 24. - Whew, I love 24. - 23, 22. - By the way, the number 11 arouses me, so make sure (Amanda laughs) you hit that one extra hard. - 21. - Like it. - 20. - Ooh. - 19. - Fuck 19. - 18. (laughs) - 18. - 17. - Ah. - 16. - Ah fuck, I just came. - 15. - I just came. - What? - I just came. (Amanda laughs) Now start over. - Oh my God, okay, fine. - Start over. (gentle music) (Hugo sighs) - I'm sorry, they keep texting me asking me if they need to bring anything, but (laughs) I've told them like five times already not to worry about it. - It's okay. Tell me more about them. - Well, what d'you wanna know, I mean, that's a very broad question? - You know what I'm getting at, are they nice, are they-- - I told you already, they're cool. - Yeah, but being cool doesn't mean they're not pricks. Most cool people are pricks by nature, that's kinda their thing, you know. - Okay, then they're nice, okay, don't worry so much. - I'm not worried, I'm just-- - I'll be there to protect you. - Oh really? - Mm-hmm. - You promise. - Yes, I promise. - See that's all it takes, and now I feel so much better. - You're not gonna do that in my car, are you, smoke? - I can't smoke? - Just not in my car. I really hate the smell, I've always hated it. - [Hugo] You've always hated it? Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know, I guess I just thought it was a phase. I thought it was something that you'd grow out of. - A phase. I would have stopped if you asked me, if you told me. - I'm not saying I want you to quit smoking. I just don't want you to do it in my car. - Well, good, 'cause I look cool when I smoke. - [Amanda] (laughs) You do not look cool. - Yeah, I do. - No, you do not. - You know I do. - No, you do not. - I look like Danny Zuko. - You look? Okay, who even wants to look like Danny Zuko? - I do, me. - Oh my God. Why? - Because John Travolta is huge in Portugal. - Okay. - Actually is. - I know that you think that you look brooding and mysterious when you smoke, but you really just look haggard. - (laughs) Haggard? - Yeah, you look like you work at Subway and you're out by the dumpster on a smoke break. - Have you ever thought that maybe it makes me uncomfortable that you've never even once shared a cigarette with me? (Amanda laughs) That you've never even tried it? - Are you serious? - Yeah, oh yeah. - So you're okay with me killing myself? - Yeah, I think it's romantic. - I hate you. (gentle music) Aren't you gonna get ready? - I am, doesn't take me that long. - God, you guys have it so easy. (sighs) Just makes sure you put on something a little more, um-- - A little more what? Why don't you tell me? - You know, a little bit-- - What? - Nicer than usual. - Nicer? - Yeah. - [Hugo] Like what? - (sighs) Just anything other than a T-shirt. - You don't like my T-shirts? - I love your T-shirts. It's not what I'm saying. - I think I look pretty good with what I normally wear. - You look great, I just-- - So what's the problem? Just be honest with me. - I think you look extra nice when you try a little bit, that's all. - You don't think I try? - I do think you try, that's not what I'm trying to say. I just, we're having people over for dinner tonight and I wanted to know if you were gonna - You know what I think? - dress up a little bit, that's all. - You know what I think? - What? - I think it's more about the fact that you don't think I care enough about you - Of course I think that you care. - to try and understand the situation. - That's not what I mean. - It just makes me feel bad, that you don't trust me to figure things out on my own. - I do trust you. - I'm not a child. - I know you're not a child. I'm sorry. - So why are you treating me like one? - I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I just want my friends to see what I see in you, that's all. Okay? I just don't understand why it's so hard for you to tell me what pants you're gonna wear. (gentle music) - So there's this enclave of women, right, all ages, races, everything else you can think of, under one roof. This is at the nunnery? - I mean, it's called a convent, but you can call it a nunnery if you want. - I like nunnery. - Let's stick with nunnery, it's better. - Nunnery is fair game? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, so they're all there under one roof at the nunnery. It's a total buffet of sexual deviance. As far as the number of gay nuns, who knows? That's between God and his daughter-sisters. Like that's not my business, I don't know the stats, but my speculation is there is a legitimate fuck-ton. Honestly, when I started coming to grips with what my preferences were, like in my earlier years, I had this fantasy of running off to become a nun. It's only for that reason. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - 'Cause you, 'cause you were imagining going to the nunnery and seeing all of these like super sexy Amazon type-- - No, I don't think there's necessarily, it's not like Wonder Woman. It's more of like a grab bag of lesbian types. It's like it's a bag of tools. Every tool serves a purpose, (everyone laughs) like some Rosie O'Donnells, some lipsticks, some Michelle Rodriguezes, like it's just all mixture. - I'm not sure Michelle Rodriguez is a lesbian. I also didn't know that you were into Rosie O'Donnell. - Why would I not be into Rosie O'Donnell? - No, there's no reason you wouldn't be into Rosie O'Donnell, I just didn't know. You think she's like a, you think she's a really good lover? - Yeah, I do, I think, I think Rosie O'Donnell's a great fuck. - So you had this fantasy, you imagined like, you know, like a hot nunnery. And then you were like picturing that like this is happening in the real world, that because you were imagining this fantasy it was also actually happening somewhere. - Yes. - Okay. How're you doing, Hugo? - I'm fine. - Great. (women all laugh) - He's great. - If you, if you at any time need to, you know, just, I'll just (clicks), I'll just (clicks). - Oh, no no. - He's fine, he's from Europe. He's fine, right? You're from Europe, it's way more progressive over there. I don't think it's quite like that where I'm from, I don't think, yeah. - No? - Yeah, it's a little more conservative in Portugal than other places. I think you're thinking about Scandinavia, probably. Yeah, over there they share needles, swap lovers, smoke pot, and that kind of thing, so. (both women laugh) - Smoke pot? - Yes. - Ooh. - It's very liberal. - So they're like the Sodom and Gomorrah to your Vatican, is that what you're saying? - Oh, you guys, I'm killing the wine. - No. - That is a very big glass, that's not fair. You can share that. (everyone laughs) - I'll go get more, it's in the garage, it's fine. I'll be right back. - I'll get it. I'll go. - No, it's fine, stay. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Yeah, hang with us. - Okay. - We're cool. - Relax, mingle. - We're super cool. - We're gonna take care of you. So Hugo, I read somewhere that Portugal has like the highest divorce rate of any developed country. (Tess laughs) Is that true? - Yeah, probably, I don't know, I'm not sure. - What, no, I find it really interesting that places that are so conservative have really high divorce rates. I think it's like some kind of psycho-spiritual correlation there. - Maybe, I don't know. (laughs) - When are you and Amanda getting married, any idea? - Okay, smooth pivot, very nice segue. - I tried, I was like. (Tess laughs) - No, it's fine. Yeah, we're just gonna take it slow, I think. - Yeah, but you're like on a, and I don't mean this to pressure you, but you're like on a one-way street. - No, yeah, and that's the plan. - You know, it's like you're on-- - And we're just trying to stay open-minded about the timing, yeah. - Okay, all right. - Then you're like on a one-way street, you know what I mean? Like with the Green Card thing, so that has to compound things. - Yeah. - I mean, you like, I feel like you need to get used to it here, probably, and you and Amanda, like you probably need a second to get your, you know, to get your groove back. - Yeah, we're not in a rush. Yeah. - And, I mean, he's only been here for like eight hours. Give him a break, you know. - It's just funny chatter. - No, it's fine. You're just curious, I understand. - Yeah. - I was actually wondering, how long have you two been together? - [Tess] Hmm, eight months? - More like two months (laughs) then six months. More like eight months over two years. It's a long story. - I fucked a guy. - Okay, yeah, she fucked a guy, so-- - [Tess] We weren't technically dating at the time. - Still hurt. - So you're not like-- - What? Oh, like a lesbian? I mean, right now I am, you know. I am technically, but I don't, I think that term is limiting, so I, I mean, you know, I was swinging sort of back and forth on the Kinsey scale for a little while, but obviously I've swung in this direction, so. - What caused that to happen? Is it just an impulse thing or-- - Everything starts with an impulse, but I think in this case, you know, it was about connection, it was about, you know, someone specifically. It was about love. I love, you know, people, so. - You love me. - Yeah, I love this person. - But you've been in love with men before? - No, but I think that that's, I don't think that's because I couldn't be in love with a man, it's just 'cause I haven't met, you know, I hadn't, I didn't meet the right man. - Oh. - You know, like having sex with men, it sort of did it for me the same way that having sex with women would. I mean, it would satisfy a similar urge. But like I don't think I was ever really emotionally satisfied with men. And I think looking back, I was kind of just, you know, using men as like, as like, it's like a dick is a great sex toy, you know. - Oh. (laughs) - So that was, and that was, that's something that I didn't realize was true about me until I started having sex with women. So, you know, Anyway. (laughs) - You're okay? - I don't wanna talk about this. I'm sorry, I'd rather not talk about this right now. - Oh, I'm sorry. - [Laura] No. - She's kind of sensitive, but with good reason. Where's Amanda, she okay? (Amanda coughs lightly) (wine bottle shatters) - Shit. - [Tess] So it's crazy that I haven't asked you this. We've been talking for like 25 minutes. But what did you do in Portugal? - Like my job? - Yeah. - I didn't do anything too important, you know, just odd jobs, construction and stuff like that. I went to school for a couple of years. - Oh. - But I had to drop out to take care of some family stuff. - [Tess] What did you go to school for? - Classical music with a focus on classical guitar. - No way, that's so cool. - Yeah, I think so. - Is there anything of yours we can listen to online? - No. (laughs) - No? - [Hugo] I never put anything up, no. I haven't played in a while, too, so. - [Tess] Have you that about maybe going back to school? - Maybe, yeah, I'm thinking about that, yeah, actually. (bottles slam) - Sorry it took me so long. (Amanda laughs) - Where's the wine? (laughs) - I guess I drank it all. So what did I miss, anything interesting? - Everything. - No, it was nothing. We were just talking to Hugo about what he did back in Portugal and whether or not maybe he might go back to school here. - Oh. - I'm thinking about that. I don't know, it just, there's a lot of things that I didn't finish that I sort of look back on and kinda hate myself for. So, you know, I just feel like I owe it to myself to at least look into it, you know. - Really? - Yeah, what do you think? Why, what do you think I should do? - [Amanda] (laughs) No, it's not about what I think you should do. I mean, we just talked about, you know, like you helping out, that's all. - I know. - Getting a job, or something. - That's important to me too. I'm not-- - And you could do, sorry. - No, it's-- - But you could do both, right, I mean-- - Yeah. - I mean, if that's what makes you happy. I just want him to do what makes him happy. So we can talk about it and figure it out, you know. - Of course. - Yeah, that's what we're supposed to do, so. - Well. - Mm-hmm. - I don't know what you guys were thinking about doing after we left, but we are gonna go to this really cool bar that's like almost like a 10-minute walk down the street, if you guys wanted to come, maybe. - It's like 10 or 15. (laughs) It's like 20, but-- - I don't know. - No, it's not 20. - It's like a pretty walk. - 10-ish. - I think Hugo's probably too tired, so-- - No, I'm good, we can go, yeah. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. (energetic dance music) (crowd chatting) (faint confused electronic music) (man shouting faintly) - Hi. - Oh, hey, what's up? - Amanda told me you were out here smoking. I want to smoke but I forgot my light. - Oh, a lighter. - Yeah. I just forget, I don't know why I forget this stuff, it's dumb. - Mm-hmm, yeah. - Thank you. - Thanks. (Hugo mumbles) - You and Laura, you guys are very cool, you're very open. - Is that a good, good thing? - Yeah, it's a good thing, yeah. - Yeah? - It's just, it's something I need to work on for myself, so I kinda appreciate it in other people. Yeah, totally. - Well, you're pretty cool too. - Ah, thank you. (Tess laughs) - Hey. - Hey, everything good? - Yes, fine, I just wanted to let you guys know we've found a spot on the patio round the corner, so. - Oh, okay. - Awesome. - We'll be there in a second. - Okay, we'll see you when you're done. - Everything all right? - Yeah, no, it's fine. (faint dance music) - So what's Portugal's national bird? - Did you take him to the Strip? - [Amanda] Oh yeah, last time he was here. - Wow. - He had fun. You had fun, right? - It's different, yeah. (everyone laughs) It's exciting, yeah. - He liked it. (laughs) - Yeah, I just don't remember the specifics, 'cause every time I came we always ended up taking small trips to other places. - Oh, yeah. - I like to travel. - Yeah, you do, don't you? - Yeah, I guess so. It's probably what brought me to Portugal, of all places, you know. - Yeah. - My mom was so pissed when I told her I was going to Portugal, like so pissed. I think she said something to me like, "Please don't leave me alone with your father." - Oh no. - Like what does that mean? - Parents say that, I mean it's like I don't think she was probably serious. - Uh, I don't know, it was one of those like, ha ha, I'm just kidding, but really this is exactly how I feel moments, you know. - So your parents are still together, right? - Yeah, my parents are still together. I mean, they're great, they've done a lot for me, but just like, don't put that shit on your kids, you know what I mean? - Right. - Yeah. What are your parents like? - But-- - Stop. - What are they like? - Yeah. (Amanda laughs) - What do you mean? - Like what fucked up shit have your parents done to you, (Tess laughs) like our parents have done to us, basically? - Yeah, yeah. - Give us the dirt. - They're divorced, which - Oh. - I know Laura is gonna appreciate. - I already knew. - What? - What? - [Laura] I knew, I could tell that you're from divorce, like you're a child of divorce, I knew. - How did you know? - Yeah. - Because you-- - Like when you first saw him? - I have like a divorce radar. - What do you mean? - What's that? - You could tell that his parents were divorced? - Yeah, I can tell, like I can tell you're a divorce-- - Just looking at me? - Like a child of divorce. - How? - Just, I mean like-- - Just look at me? - What, what? - You can tell. - Is it my shirt? - It's not bad. - No, it's not. - So it's a dissage? - I'm not saying that. - Is it my pineapple shirt? - His pineapple? - There are a lot of successful people that are children of divorce. Like it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing. - What are you doing? - Like John Wayne, like Abraham Lincoln, like Ted Bundy. - What, do you-- Like Sean Diddy Combs. - Hold on, rewind, did you just call Ted Bundy a successful person? (laughs) - He was successful at what he set out to do. And he was hot, he was the hot serial killer. (laughs) - [Amanda] Just digging yourself deeper and twisting it all. - Did you hear the other people that I said? - Yeah, yeah. - Laura. - It's not an insult. - Take it from-- - These are all hot, these are all good-looking people. - These are all hot people. - Yeah right, you're just saying that he - I would have-- could be a hot serial killer. - I would have gone straight for Abraham Lincoln, - Hey. - I'm telling you. - Oh, me too. - He abolished slavery. (Laura and Amanda laugh) Marfan, heart disease. - You're into Marfan syndrome? - Yeah. - Oh my God. - Big hands. - Okay. - But really, honestly, like in all sincerity, and I'm smiling because I have a disorder. (laughs) (everyone laughs) - You're just smiling, just-- - I laugh when I'm uncomfortable. - Okay. - [Tess] That's why she's uncomfortable. - Okay. - Oh, she doesn't like to be sincere. - I'm trying to be sincere. Honestly, I'm sorry. - For what? - 'Cause like your parents were divorced, like it, then it fucked you up, like your life is fucked up, I'm sorry. - He's not fucked up. You're not fucked up, he's not. - Are they happier now? - My mom is, yeah. - [Tess] How about your dad? - Uh, he died, that's why, probably. Yeah, he died in the house he and my mom owned together. It wasn't paid off, so my mother's been struggling a bit. That's actually why I dropped out of school. I was just trying to help my mother. - Oh, man. - I was actually, before I came here I was living with her back at the house, trying to help her make the payments, yeah. But everything is fine now 'cause we lost the house, which means, - What? - which means we don't, we're not in debt anymore, which is a good thing, it's a good thing. - Yeah? - Did you just thumbs up? - I promise you, it's good news, yeah, now we don't have, we can just move on, yeah. - Wow, that's a nice thing you did for your mom. - Ah, yeah, I guess, yeah. - You guess? - I started to resent her by the end of it. - Your mom? - 'Cause, yeah. And I feel bad about it. I just, I'll be, perhaps you'll think I'm an asshole. - No. - No, no, I don't, I mean, I don't personally think that you should feel that way. I don't know why you feel that way. I mean, that's a tough situation, you know. - Yeah, it is. - Sometimes they can be real fucking dicks, parents. - I agree. (Laura laughs uncomfortably) See, I just feel like I was the one making all the sacrifices. Like she's my mother, but I was the one kinda giving all the time. - Yeah. - I think I just stuck around out of duty, - Yeah. - which probably made everything worse, so. Guess I'm just realizing that now. - You didn't tell me that you were back at home when your mom lost the house. (Amanda laughs uncomfortably) - I'm telling you now. I just didn't wanna burden you with it. - I wouldn't have been burdened. - I know, just, what? - I just wish you, I could have been there. - Why're you so upset? - I just wish I could have been there for you, that's all. I'm sorry, I think I'm just being drunk right now. - You're so, you're fine. - No, I'm sorry. I'm fine, I'm totally, everything's fine, we're fine. - I just feel like you think I didn't say anything just to spite you or something. It wasn't that. - Right, no, that's not it at all. (Amanda sighs) - Please don't do that, if something is bothering you let us talk, - Do what? - get it over with. - I told you, it's fine. Even if it wasn't, I'm so done talking about it tonight. - You're sure? - Yes, I am sure. - I'm having a hard time getting a read on you lately. - Well, did you like them, at least? - I did, actually. - Good, I'm glad. - I think they're cool. - They are cool. - Yes, I enjoyed the conversation. - Good. - I did. - (laughs) Good. - Okay. - I'm happy. - Can I ask you something, though? - Yeah, what? - It's gonna sound weird. - Okay, what did I say? - How long have you been hanging out with them? - Um, I don't know, like three months, maybe. I met them at this pottery class I was taking. - Do you know a lot of lesbians? What? - That's just kind of a weird question to ask, I mean. - Just a question. - Do you have a problem with lesbians? - No. - Did they, did they make you feel uncomfortable or something? - No, the opposite. - I mean, Hugo? - What? - They make fun of your pee-pee? Aw-- - Look, I love lesbians, all right, they're very - You love lesbians. - Utilitarian-- - Wow, you love them. - Yes. - Did you just say utilitarian? - Yeah, why? Is my English wrong or something? (Amanda sighs) Look, honestly-- - No. - I just, I've never seen two really pretty lesbians together. Usually there's one really good-looking one and one that looks like, - What does that even mean? - I know, Crispin Glover. Usually you only see two - What does that mean? - really good-looking lesbians together in porn. That was the joke, but-- - Wow. (Hugo mutters) - Okay. - What, it's a joke, I don't mean it. - It's not a very funny joke. I mean, they're my friends. - Why're you taking it so seriously? - That's just like a really shitty thing-- - It's a joke. - It's not funny. Okay? - Okay, I'm sorry I'm trying to make you laugh. I'm sorry. - (sighs) You're right, I'm sorry, I just, I think I'm just feeling overwhelmed from all the excitement today, I'm sorry. It's so tiring. - That's fine. - It's fine, I'm fine. - Are you sure you're all right? - Yeah. - You sure? - I'm fine. - You sure? - Yes, I'm-- - Are you? - I'm sorry, I'm fine. - You sure? - Oh God, I'm not. - What? Ooh. (vomit splashing) (Amanda coughing) Okay, don't worry. - [Amanda] Just don't look, it's so gross. (sobs) - I'm not looking, I'm here but I'm not looking. Don't worry. - Just step back, I don't wanna get it on your shoes, okay. - Ah, don't worry, I put Scotchgard on 'em, so have at it. A little too much to drink, huh? (laughs) I'm here, don't worry. (gentle music) You all right? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yeah. - Sure? (Amanda coughs) Oh! (vomit splashes) (gentle music) - Sorry. (Hugo mumbles) - Gimme a kiss. - Oh no. (laughs) - Please? - Oh no, oh please, no. - Sorry. - What? - I just got a little bit woozy first again. - You did? - Mm-hmm. - You want something? - Mm, could you distract me? - (laughs) What? - [Amanda] I mean like do something silly or-- - Like a face or something? - [Amanda] No, like, uh, hmm. - What? - Like talk to me in Portuguese or something. - [Hugo] What am I gonna say? - I don't know, something nice. - Something nice? - Yeah. - Okay, I think I got something. - Okay. - I should, I'm Portuguese. That's it. - That's it? Come on, keep going. - Um, I think we haven't talked with each other for a long time, at least not like this. I'm sorry. (laughs) Are you enjoying this? - Yeah. - Okay. (laughs) That's it, I don't know. - Is that it? - Yeah. - What did you say? All I got was something about love. - I said that I love you, that's it. - No, come on. You said a lot more than that. What did you say? - Now you say something in Portuguese. - No. (laughs) - Say something. - No, I don't want to. - Now say something. - No. - You remember anything? You don't? - No, I do, okay, um. - What, say that again? - What are you trying to say? - One coffee, please? - Oh. - Oh, I get it, it's good. - It's right? - You still got it. Yeah, good for you. What? - I don't believe you. - You-- (Amanda laughs) - Is my Portuguese that bad? - What? - My Portuguese that bad? - No, it's good. - Aargh. - Ah, you remember that one. (toilet flushing) (Amanda speaking faintly) (Amanda sniffling) (Amanda sighs) (crickets chirping) (thunder roars faintly) (birds tweeting) (guitar briefly strums) (guitar strumming) (hesitant guitar music) (Amanda sniffs) What is it, just say it? (Amanda groans softly) Come here, hey. - Say what? - Hey, look at me. (Amanda laughs) What, why're you laughing? Amanda, you're so quiet, it's really scaring me. Please say something, just say it. What? - I was with somebody else. - Okay. Who is he? Who is he? - She, it was a she. - Is or was a she? - Is. (Amanda sniffs) I'm sorry. I need you to know how I feel. - Why, it's gonna make me feel better? Knowing that you feel like shit? - [Amanda] No. - I'm not gonna give you that closure. - It's not about closure. - Then what is this about? I came here under the impression that we're gonna get married, until you called me up one night, crying, (exhales heavily) telling me that you, that you couldn't go through with it, that you wanted to wait and see once I got here, and I'm fine with that. I would never pressure you to do anything. - Do you even care it was a girl? - Guy, girl, doesn't matter. Why, are you gay or something? - I don't think so. - How don't you know? - I'm not, okay. - So you're bi? - Yeah, I think so. - How long have you known? Were you planning on telling me, were you? Just say something, anything, just help me. Amanda. - What? What do you want me to say? - Everything. - Okay, I met her through Tess at a concert, and we-- - You fucked each other? - No, not then, we just had a few drinks, and we got along and we started to spend time together, and it just kind of happened. Kind of like how you and I happened. - That might be true, but I really wish you didn't say that. (gentle music) (people speaking faintly) - Yo. - What's up? - Got a light? - Yeah. Can I have it back? - Cool man. Fuck, it's hot out here. - Yeah. - What's your name, man? - Hugo, you? - Rodney. - Nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you too, man. Fuck you doing out here all casual, man? You ain't got no place to be? - Just trying to get away. Yeah, don't really have a place to be now. - Kinda accent is that, man? Sound like you're from Albania. - (Scoffs) Not from Albania, no. - You're running from home, who're you running from? - [Hugo] My girlfriend. - She's beating you or something? - Yeah, I don't really wanna talk about that. - You're out here chilling, it's hot. - It is hot. - We're like friends now, man. Come on, man, spit it out. - My girlfriend has been seeing someone. - You know the dude? - It's a girl. - Okay, that's kinda progressive. - Yeah, guess my girlfriend has a girlfriend. It's kinda fucked up. - Shit, I'm just kinda wondering how you got her to do it. I've been trying to get my girl to sleep with another girl for years, man. Shit, I even offered to pay her ass. - It's kinda complicated. - Sounds like some Maury Povich, some reality show shit there. - What's that? - Oh, you never heard of Maury Povich? - No. - So basically, if the bitch wants to embarrass you by telling you the kid ain't yours, instead of telling you face to face in private, she takes you on national TV and shit. Then Maury fucks her. You ever heard that story about the lady that cut her husband's penis off? - No. - He was laying there dead asleep, right. Cut his dick off, hopped in the car, drove down the street, threw that shit out the window into somebody else's yard, right. Now, but here's the thing, though. They got his penis back. - So like I have a huge hole where my dick used to be. Kind of feel like dickless. Do I look dickless to you? - A little bit, man, you need your dick, man. - Do I? You're very perceptive. You're a good guy. - I'm trying to catch this bus, man. You ain't possibly got like three bucks I can get off of you, man? - Oh yeah, I got ya. - I know it sounds fucked up but I mean, you know, it's - No, it doesn't, it's fine. - kinda hard out here, man. - [Rodney] Ah man, appreciate that. - [Hugo] Here. - Hey man, I kinda fucked up, man, it's actually five bucks, man. I know the buses went up and everything. My bad, I fucked up, it's five. Oh man, can I get $5 from you, man? I mean, I don't make the bus prices. - Fuck, are you shaking me down? - [Rodney] No, why I gotta be shaking you down? - It feels like it. - Man, that's racist, man. - No, it's not. - So why d'you have to make it a race thing? - I'm not making it a race thing, you're making it a race thing. - Look at you, man, you're already feeling all uncomfortable and shit. - No, I'm not. - I didn't even do anything, man. You could have just said no. - Okay, no then. - But see, it don't work like that, though. So now you're being an Indian giver. - That's racist. - Look, man, I just need ten bucks. You said you just gonna help me out. - Now it's 10, okay. - It's 10. - Got it, just take it, I don't care. Fucking take it, boom. Fuck! - Man, I don't even want the money if it's gonna be like that. - I don't want it back. - No man, go ahead, just take the money. [Hugo] - No, you take it. - I think you need this shit, man. - [Hugo] I don't want it. - Look, man, you got shit going on with your girl. You probably wanna buy - No, don't worry about that. - a couple of lap dances or some shit. - No, I'm good, you take it. - No, come on, man. Like I don't know if you do meth or some shit, but you probably need it for some meth. Go ahead, man, take the money back. - Actually, I might need it. Not for meth, though. Maybe we can share it, d'you wanna share it? Oh no, d'you need some meth? - [Rodney] No, I don't need no meth, but I need that money, though. (gentle music) - [Train Announcer] Next stop, Caesars Palace Station. (crowds chatting faintly) (door squeaking) (door slamming) - [Amanda] Hugo? - Just relax, right. - Are you drunk? You know what, just get out. I can't even talk to you now, you're just gonna run off and get drunk. - The fuck did you expect me to do, huh? - I don't know, not run and hide like a child. Maybe I thought you'd stay and actually talk to me about this. - Okay, now you wanna talk. Only took you three months, but let's talk. - So it's okay when you keep things from me, but not if it's the other way round? - It's not the same thing. It's not the same thing. - What about your mom? You didn't tell me that she lost the house. - It's not the same thing. - You didn't tell me that you were staying with her, and that you were helping her out. - It's not the same thing. How could you even say that? It's not the same thing. - I wish I could've been there for you, but you said that you didn't wanna burden me. When did you decide that you just didn't, you couldn't confide in me anymore? And you might not wanna hear this right now, but you've pulled away from me just as much as I've pulled away from you. - That's not true. It's not true. - I made a big mistake. I really fucked up and I feel really shitty that I hurt you. - Okay. - But I, I just, I needed-- - [Hugo] But what? If you feel the need to use the word but after it, then it wasn't a mistake, right, it wasn't. - Yeah, it wasn't a mistake, okay? - Okay, good. Thank you. - Is that what you wanted to hear? - Yeah, in honesty. - It wasn't a mistake. - Yeah, thank you, good. Thanks for being honest. - I met her and I felt something that I hadn't felt before, okay? - Oh, okay. - And I needed to explore that because if I didn't it would feel like I was fucking betraying myself. And I couldn't be with you and do this for real without knowing what that was. So that's-- - So you did it for me? That's what you're saying, you did it for us. Okay, you did it, and now what? - It's like you meet somebody and they're new and they're different and it's exciting. And it's fucking, (laughs) it's fucking scary, okay? - What, you weren't feeling that for me? - I didn't wanna feel like it was following me around my whole life. I felt like I needed to explore that before I moved forward with you so that it didn't just come up later. - Where do I fit in now? Do you still even wanna do this? - Do you even know what you want? - I just wanna talk about it. I wanna figure it out with you. - Do you wanna be in love with me? - I think that distance makes you forget about things, about how you feel. And I, I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to remember. I don't know. - Who is she? - [Amanda] What? - I wanna meet her, who is she? - Her name is Marta. - Okay, good. - Why do you wanna meet her? - Can you call her up? - Don't you think - I just think it's a good idea - that's a terrible-- - if she comes by - Don't you think that's just gonna piss you off? - and we can talk this out. Maybe, I don't know, probably, or it's just the best idea I've ever had. I don't know, do you have a better idea? - No. - Okay, so call her up. You love her, maybe I'll love her, I don't know. - What does that mean? - It's the new millennium, the Mormons do it, I don't know. Can you call her up? - When? - Now, tonight. (gentle music) - Whole situation is bizarre. Uh, (laughs) tonight if you're not busy. Okay, great, thank you, it means a lot. Okay, bye. There. (Marta knocking) (door squeaks) - So, Marta, right? - Yeah. Am I saying that right? - Mm-hmm. - Pretty name, I like it. - Thanks. - Sounds like a car. - (laughs uncomfortably) I like your accent. - Oh, thank you, I appreciate it. - Yep, I am. That's kinda weird, no? - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess so. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, okay, I guess my accent is hard to pin down. - This is so fucked up. - Do you know who Crispin Glover is? - No. - Oh, you don't? - No. - If it's any consolation, you're a lot, like a lot prettier than he is. So, you know, good on you, Amanda. Look, I just, I know this is kinda weird, it's kind of awkward, it feels like a special event, but I do appreciate you coming over. You know, it takes balls, balls that you obviously have. - Okay, Amanda told me it was important and I wanna support her, so here I am, yeah. - Good, good on you. All right, I have a question, can I ask it? Yeah, of course. - Right, are you a lesbian? - Hugo! - No, Amanda, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - It's fine, it's fine. - Why are you-- - I'm not sure, and, I don't know, probably I'm a little, but I like to think I'm a bit more open-minded than that, you know. - How the fuck aren't you sure? Ever since I've been here it seems like the thing here, no one knows. Okay, I have an idea. Let's just, you know, let's think about all the relevant possibilities. We can nail them up on that wall, and then just fucking throw darts at it. - I like Amanda a lot. - Okay. - And I'm very attracted to her. And honestly, I'm jealous of you, Hugo, that you've had her in your life for, what, how many years now? - Four. - Four years. - Yeah. - That's good. - [Hugo] It's a very long time. - What are you getting at, Hugo? - Do you apologize? - Honestly, I don't wanna be your enemy, Hugo. - I'd don't wanna be your enemy either. - I don't want you to think that I turned your girlfriend this way, okay? There's no lesbian voodoo or whatever you wanna think's going on here. - Yeah, I mean, we have something. I understand why he's upset. Honestly, I'm kind of upset with myself. - Now I think you're being a little too hard on yourself, you know. - Well, it seems pretty reasonable to me. - Amanda, listen, I bet you've been having these feelings for as long as you can remember, all right. And what you're doing right now is just you're feeling your way through them, and that's normal. - Again, not that normal. - Okay, fine, not that normal. But you know what? I've been through it too, and it was a, (laughs) I mean, it was a really tough part of my life, you know. But I just needed to go through it. And, yeah, I'm sure I hurt people, and maybe it was really selfish of me, but, I mean, I know in my heart that living with myself would be something that would've been really tough, and, and now I'm grateful, you know, I'm grateful I can look myself in the mirror and I finally know who I am. And, (sighs) and look, Amanda, I don't think you have a responsibility to either one of us. (Amanda sighs) - Aargh. I appreciate what you're saying. It's just, I don't think that it really is the same situation. I did something really bad, you know. I was in a relationship and I crossed boundaries that I shouldn't have. And I did things that I knew would hurt you. I'm sorry, I just felt like over the past couple of years I was complacent in our relationship, and I got bored and I just started to think about things that might excite me again. You know, and then I met Marta and I started to feel those things that I felt when you and I first met. - Okay, so what happens now? - I don't, I'm, fuck, um, I'm sorry. I just, I think that I want, Hugo, to try to work on our relationship. I hope that you don't feel that I led you on, 'cause that wasn't my intention. Are you okay? - Um, yeah, yeah, I am, um, I understand. Um, I'm just getting out now, okay. - Where, uh, Marta, hold on a second. Why did you say it like that? - What, that I wanted to work things out? - Why did you say it like you're falling on a sword? - I don't understand, I told you that I was trying to fix things and now you're gonna crucify me for it? - Look-- - What do you want? - If you wanna be with her, be with her. I just want you to want to be with me, all right? - I don't think it's that simple. I'm sorry if you do. - I don't want you to feel obligated to be in a relationship. That's all I want. - Break up with me, just fucking do it. I don't wanna prevent you from finding something that's perfect, and this is pretty fucking far from perfect right now, don't you think? What do you think? Do you think that he should break up with me? I don't think that I can give you what you want or tell you what you wanna hear. So just do it. - Whoa. (breathes deeply) I'd better head out now, okay. (door squeaking)
