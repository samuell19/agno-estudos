There's the limo. Code red. Code red. Sir, there may be an assassin in the building. We're gonna take you out the back entrance. Detective Willis, I've got orders to disarm and detain you. Sure. - Move it. - Up here. All right, in here. Move it! Move! Back against the wall, now! It's right around the right. Right down there. -Careful. Freeze! Cliff! Cliff! Let's go! Let's go! No, no, no, the other door. Freeze! Drop it! Both of you, in the closet, now! Who are you? Who are you, God damn it? What do you want? Clear this area. Lock it down, lock it down. Hey! Out of the way. All right, everybody, move. No pulse. He's dead. Make sure it's clear down there. -Come on, keep moving. -Uniform, seal this off. Yeah, check... Check down there. - Let's go, sir. - Let's go, come on. This way, Senator. -Yes. as to why Detective Willis would want to assassinate Senator Holt? Lieutenant Flynn. The depart... The department is conducting an investigation, but at this time, we have no motive. Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Yes, sir. Senator, do you still intend to run for President? I want to be President. -Gallagher, FBI. -Mmm-hmm. -What's in the bag? -Security equipment. Open it up. Hey! Hey! Freeze, right now! - Hold it! Hold it! - Shoot him. Senator, get down. Senator! Stop him! Look! Are you all right? All right, let's go. As you can see here, there was a fire reported at the ballroom here, and, oh, we have to move for the gurney here. A very, very busy crime scene here, and we'll be right back with more, uh, right after this... Well, were you here when this happened? Oh! Mom, please take her out of here, please. Nurse! Hi. Hi. Come here, honey. Come on, honey. My God. What have I become? I'm telling you, man. This place is completely fucking outrageous. It's... It's outrageous, man. Come on, check it out. - Looks pretty wild. - It is, man. -It's big, huh? -Yeah. Yeah, a pretty large place. I'm telling you, man. This is gonna be a rave they're gonna be talking about for years. -Whoa. -Come on, guys. - Hey. - Whoo! Look at these ceilings. Yeah. All right! Look at that. We could burn this place down, man. Far fuckin' out. This way, man, over here. Come on, check it out. You got the main hall upstairs, then you got this level. People could just chill. Maybe we could put a bar down here, man. Hey, there's more down below. I'm telling you, man, this place just goes on and on. Whoo! People can just explore. I want to call it "Bad to the Max." I like it. It's got potential. It's got a lot of potential. Let's get outta here. We've got a rave to promote. Yes. This place is fucking great. You're a fucking genius, Stanton. Do you hear that? You're fucking out of this world. Yes... I am at that. You coming or what? Later. Yo, what the hell you think you're doing? -These are car keys. -Yeah, what's it to you? I like cars, too. Now, get lost, okay? What the... J-Jesus, it's only a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. -Let's just leave, okay? -Uh, yeah. Let's get out of here. Hmm. -Mmm. -What the hell's going on here? Hmm. You don't, and I'm calling the cops. Eat this, asshole. Don't ever, ever bother me while I'm eating. I like this. "Stun gun. Give 'em a jolt they'll never forget." I like this a lot. Oh. Oh, I want this car. Are you the valet? Look, uh, take this, put this towards a down payment. And send me over a valet, will you, please? But I want this car. He wants this car. -And I want the girl. -Oh, he wants... What the... Hey, stop that. Hey, what are you... Along with his stolen Corvette, was found dead at the old Grayson Steel Mill after being abducted earlier this evening. It is believed that the suspect may have been involved in several other brutal incidents in the vicinity earlier today. You can go for them or me, not both. One or the other, motherfucker. One or the other! Gotta go. Bye. I've already sent for backup. It didn't help last time. You lose, sucker. Wrong, motherfucker, you lose. Here's your father, Police Detective Thomas Beck. They, uh, found him by the old Grayson Steel Mill. It seems like he'd been in one heck of a fight. I gotta tell you, we see a lot of weird things, but this was pretty strange for such an old man. My father wasn't old. Well, somebody should've told him that. That's not my father. Look, I just work here. I hadn't seen him in a couple of years, but he was only 48. You don't believe me? Look. Listen, lady, all I know is dental records don't lie. Excuse me? Well, he came in as a John Doe. They used dental records to, uh, make positive ID. I'm sorry. I'll, uh, give you a few minutes alone. What happened to you? God damn it, what happened to you? Don't! No. Ah! Okay. Okay, okay, please. Sit. Cut yourself. Huh? You heard me. Cut yourself. You gotta be kidding. Not kidding. Small, on the finger. Do it! The knife. Slowly. The other hand, hold it out. I thought you were one of them, I'm sorry. One of "them"? One of them. Or one of us. What do you mean? I suppose it was hidden from you all these years. Hidden? What? The truth... About your father. Get dressed. Now. My clothes are in there. I'll be right outside this door. What about my father was hidden? Right. And I suppose you're an alien, too? Yes. Great, this is just great. The message we received was garbled and unintelligible, but what we did get indicated there might have been a spawning. A spawning? That and the name of your father, Thomas Beck. We tried. The trail dead-ends with him. I got here too late. Look, what exactly is it that you want with me? -Your help. -My help? You have a very peculiar way of asking for someone's help. Well, I'm sorry about before. I did what I had to do. But I meant you no harm. Right. And I'd really like to help you. Good. Let's get started, then. No. You don't believe a word I said, do you? You are one mixed-up, complex human being. Get back. Now do you believe me? Your body... The life force had already departed. You mean... Dead? Not dead. but that which you call the soul had already left. This body was no longer important to it. This is too weird. I have to find the ones who came before me. Especially the one named Rautus. It butchered countless of my people. Who knows what it might have done here. "It"? The closest concept you have, you people, is of evil incarnate. His kind, they kill for pleasure, take indiscriminately. Our fear is that it might have spawned. Let's hope that it hasn't. -Your father? -Yeah. Then after my, uh, mom died, he withdrew, lived like a hermit. I hadn't seen him in a couple of years. I tried, but he wouldn't let me. I'm sorry. I guess I didn't really know him. Look, what exactly are we looking for anyway? Anything out of the ordinary, possible clues he may have left behind. You? Yeah. Did you love him? Well, yeah. He was my dad. That was a long time ago. It doesn't seem like that much to go on. No. I need to see where he lived. I can't believe he lived like this. Don't you think it might cause too much attention? -But this place, it's empty. -Trust me on this. -Besides, this will probably be a lot easier. Probably a lot quieter, too. Well, he's either very efficient... Or? Or very narcissistic. What do you mean? He worked his way out in concentric circles. That's very efficient. What about the other possibility? He just enjoyed surrounding himself with his handiwork, mayhem and death. Either way, he may have become one of them. You don't mean that, uh... That he was responsible for this, these... These murders? I'm sorry. I wish I could make it different. Underneath the surface, you and I are not that different. I am not the enemy. Yeah. It did spawn. How do you know? In that dog. MacThese things, they're perfect killing machines. They stay in hibernation until the conditions are right. The conditions may have changed. They use up a host body, throw it out, Wait. Wait a minute. and we're planning to go after them alone? We tell the authorities, they'll put me in an insane asylum. they'll turn me into a scientific specimen. There are no alternatives. Your people have nothing capable of stopping them. Nothing. This is the only weapon that can kill them. Let's just hope we find them before it's too late. Great. This is just great. They would never have spawned here. It's too open, vulnerable. Wait. -What's that? -What? That, off in the distance. I don't know. A motor of some sort. No. Music. You said they come out of hibernation when the conditions are right. What did you mean? Warmth, humidity... Potential hosts. We need to check the lower levels. Look, would they really be in a place like this? This place, these people would be perfect for them. Once they come out of hibernation, they could be in anybody. They're here. Let's go, now. -Just leave? What about these? -There's no time to explain. One of them's already gone. That's much more dangerous. We'll come back for these later. Hey, come on. Sorry. -Hey. Okay. Wait here. I'll be back. - Come on, man. - Ow! Hey, asshole. We have to stop it before it transfers again. What, that woman? It saw you, so you're in danger. If it comes after you, this will slow it down. -It won't kill it? -No. The only way to stop it is to force it out of the human host. Shoot to kill, not wound. Aim for the head and the vital organs. When the body's no longer able to function, it'll have to come out. Then we're to kill it with this. But I've never shot a gun in my life. Hmm. -Interesting. -Yeah. -Different. Hey, what the... What? - Get off of me. - Come on, man. You looking for me? Now you've really pissed me off. You okay? Hey, man. What the... Let's go. That's not him. Fuck you. Without this you're nothing. You're not even worth killing. You couldn't hurt me now if you tried. Fuck you, asshole. Are you all right? Am I all right? There's nothing that can stop that thing, nothing. I am anything but all right. Well, what about my father's weapon? Huh? Huh? Check in with me in five minutes. All right, listen carefully, whatever happens, you find that weapon. Now, if I'm shot, if I'm injured, even if I'm killed, you leave, I'll find you later. You gotta be kidding. -What, as someone else? -If that's necessary. Hurry. Masterson, it looks like we have a situation down here. Looks like a break-and-enter. -Got it. -Let's go. Now! You know, you're very good at this. Maybe I have a future in crime. So, what now? We go back for the others. Before it's too late. You know, you sure know how to show a gal a good time. You know, we haven't much time. We better... Get on with it. Yeah. MacThe weapon. The weapon, now. Shoot me. Ah! Now, God damn it! Do it! Thanks. I needed that. I thought I killed you. The weapon has no effect on human flesh. It's the wrong composition. You're cut. Hazard of the trade. It doesn't look too deep, though. I think I'll survive. So, won't these spawn, too? Can't. So, what do we do now? There's no choice but to wait. Wait? There's no way to track it. It will come back here, Then, and only then, will it return to protect its siblings. But they're dead. I know that, and you know that, I intend to be here when it returns. How can we just leave them there? The metamorphosis won't happen for another 12 to 14 hours. So, in the meantime, there's no reason to stay, as long as I'm back before it returns. What's wrong? What is it? It's nothing. Just give me a moment. Are you okay? This body, it needs, uh... Fuel. Oh, it's nothing. Really. So, what the hell happened to you back there? I told you, this body, it needs fuel. No. This body also needs rest. Food and rest? You expect me to buy that? Food and rest. Yes. I'd like you to buy that. I have no money. Oh, that's where I went to school. You went to school here? "Osu." No, OSU. It's a university. It's a university. Yeah. Okay. Here, um, why don't you try this? It might be a little easier. Mmm. Mmm. -This is good, this food. -Mmm. Different. Tell me about it. Well, for one, there's no Chinese food. No, really, what's it like? It's very different. It's like nothing in your experience. Energy, light. No physical body, just being. We feel, but not as you do. We sense, but it's not concrete. It's real, but not solid. We live in spirit, not in body. Hmm. Like heaven? Like heaven... But not. A hunger within to feel, to touch... To breathe. The others, they have not. They have evolved into the opposite. We and they, we are the same. So those things... Evolved from the same species. Well, here you go. The couch is all yours. But what am I gonna do with it, this couch? I'm sure you'll figure it out. And I'll leave a toothbrush out for you. I've got an extra one. Toothbrush. I'm sorry. I forgot you're not from around these parts. Here, let me show you. Now, first, you have toothpaste. It helps a lot. Go like this and that. Now, open up. Ah. Very good. Now... And over here. Nice? Oop. MacMmm. Mmm. Well, um... You get the idea. This world of yours, it's very beautiful. Well, to realize all the things you've never had can make one sad. To feel, to touch, to fill your lungs with crisp, fresh air, to feel hunger and thirst... Even pain. All these things I've never known before. -So much... Mmm. But I'm what you want This music, it stinks. Huh? I like this radio. Hey, now, wait a minute, partner. Where you going with that thing? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Be real careful with that. -Don't touch that thing, man. -I gotta go now. Don't put your hand on that, man. That's real dangerous. Bye. The car's down. That's what I'm saying, you know? -You hear the music? Hey, yo, man, you're in the wrong part of town. What's up with you, man? Hey, hey, hey, hey. You crazy upside your head, motherfucker? -Look at that. -We gonna have some fun. Let's go check him up. Let's check him up. Nice boom box, motherfucker. Nice car, motherfucker. Ooh! Yeah. You got balls dissing me, man. Now, give me the fucking box and get your white ass outta here. Nice move. What the fuck is he doing? I should do you right here, motherfucker. Huh? Do him! God damn. What the fuck? Come on, come on! Hey. Let's drop this guy! -Go ahead, try me. -Cool. You believe that? Wasted him. The system is fucked up Just to come up I put a Gat in her purse Keep movin', don't sleep will get you got in some parts of IE Hey, are you all right? Hey. Oh, my God. You're burning up. -What are you talking about? -No doctor! Just give me a moment. This will pass. Physical contact is an absolute concentration. Talk to me. What is going on? -Difficult to explain. -Try. Don't know if you wanna know. I do. I can't stay here forever. We change. Some sooner, some later, but for all of us... It's inevitable. What do you mean? Purely physical. It eats away at us like a cancer. We can fight it for a while, but ultimately, Hey, what the... What's going on? What's he doing? You feeling okay, buddy? Oh, now, wait a minute there, bud. Hey! Someone better help him. You gotta be kidding me. This food... Not very good. I appreciate your offer, but I have to do this alone. Look, I can't just sit here waiting to find out what happened, wondering, worrying. It will already have metamorphosed. It's too dangerous for you to come. I care for you. I care about you, too. It's bad enough what will happen to me. It's part of what I do, I've come to accept that. I could never live with myself. And what about me? I have feelings, too. No. No, not anymore. Not since that thing came here 15 years ago. Not since I lost my father. Look, if we don't destroy that thing now, it's bad, right? Eventually it'll spawn again, and we'll be in deep shit. "Deep shit." Yes, your people will be in that. In that case, I am coming with you. And if I can help just one little bit, it'll be worth it. It will kill without hesitation. We must do the same. It will show no mercy. We must do likewise. It will get ugly. I understand, but if not now, if not by us, then what? We must hurry. Let's rock and roll. It's a figure of speech, you know, like "kick butt," "ice the mother." It's time. We must hurry! Get down! Now aren't you glad I came? Listen, whatever happens, don't let him take me. Whatever you have to do, just do it. -What? -Just run. Run like hell. If at least one of us comes out of this, at least there's hope. -But... -Just do it! Now! Juliet! You son of a bitch. Eat this, motherfucker. It's over. It's okay. It's over now. But it's over. Juliet. Move very slowly. -You all right? -Yes. Oh. I guess this just ain't my day. What's wrong? I can feel it inside me. -What? -Change. If I stay... It's not gonna get any better. It'll only get worse. Like my father? Ras bedoin. What's that? Nothing. It's a saying from our Book of Books. "The flower on the hill." I'd choose the few good years I could have here with you. I've seen what it does, what it did to my father. I care about you too much for that. It's the rest of the saying. "The flower on the hill, like a stranger in a strange land, "it passes like the wind."
