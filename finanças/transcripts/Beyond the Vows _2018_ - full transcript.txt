(light music) (light dramatic music) (phone ringing) (beeping) - Just take care of her. She's probably hungry or something. Okay, bye. - Mommy duties call? - Yeah, well how can I help you, ma'am? - I'm here to try on my dress. - Oh, okay, all right. - Are you new here? - Yeah, sorry, my name's Alexis. Today makes a week. - I love that necklace. - Oh, thank you. We actually have some more in the front if you wanna see them. - No, better not. - Are you sure? - I don't wanna crush my budget. - Okay, well what's your last name? - Burbanks - Burbanks. - Karen Burbanks. - Okay, um, your dress is actually in the dressing room. If you need anything, let me know. - All right, thank you. - Oh, baby, look at you. - I just, I love, love this dress. - Yes, I um, yeah, what about all that skin? You know, all in your mid-drifting. You know, all this right here, baby. I, I, you don't think that's too much? - I'm trying to look sexy for my husband. - Baby, you've already got his attention. You don't have to try so hard. It's better to be conservative. - Okay You're probably right. - Yes. - Whew, Lord, it is hot out there, honey. - Thanks for coming. - Girl, okay, I guess. It's hot out there girl, I need a drink. (Delissa clearing throat) Hey, sister Delissa. - Afternoon. - All right, Karen, I'm here for you. So, what else do you need me to do girl? Let me see, okay this dress, all right. Mid-drift showin'. You know we can lose-- - Can I get you guys anything? - All of this. - [Alexis] A drink? - Yes, please. - No thank you. - I'll get it in a minute, yeah. - Oh, sure. - Okay, but I'm digging it though. I'm likin' it. - I love this. - It's cute. You know, we can make it shorter. - And here I thought it was mother daughters day. - It's my day. Please don't ruin it. - Okay, baby. - Okay, well has she settled down? Okay, well I don't even get off until 7:00. So, I'll be there as soon as I can. - I think somebody needs a man. - And I think you need the man. - Did you? - You know the one upstairs and not the two in your bed. - Did you bring the thank you cards? - I did. Here you go, here you go, friend. Take that out, that that out. - Oh no, no, this is all wrong. You got the dates mixed up and the pastor's name is spelled wrong. - [Dottie] Oh, I'm sorry. - Baby, let me see. Give it to me. You know what, I can easily fix this. I'm a good fixer. If you want something done right, you gotta give it to your mama. - Thank you so much, mom. Hurry, they close at 5:00. - You got it, baby. (scoffs) - You look good. - Oh you know, mom, I would do that if I had a place of my own. Okay, bye. Bye. (Alexis groans) - You know your mama thinks that I'm the devil's daughter herself? - What time is it, I have to go. I have to meet Don in a few minutes. - Okay, look, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Before you go. Are you sure about all this? - Yeah, why are you asking me that again? Whatever you're trying to say, don't. (Dottie sighs) - Can I get that drink? - [Alexis] I'm coming. - Oh, no thank you. Let's go. (knocking on door) - [Pastor Holland] Come in. Hey, how are you doing? - Hey. - [Pastor Holland] Good, good to see you guys. Have a seat. All right, so, how are you guys doing? - Great. Never better. - Last time we met we talked about emotional intimacy and temptation. - Yeah, yeah, that's right. I was saying I don't take a second look. I try to avoid places and people that make temptation easier for me, you know? And especially when I'm feeling alone. - [Pastor Holland] This feeling, does it make you vulnerable? - Yes. It's the lack of intimacy. - [Pastor Holland] Can you explain? - Okay, Karen's job, it's stressful and I understand that, so I try not to bother her, but, Pastor, a brother get lonely and this whole silent treatment thing. - Silent? - Uh, verbally, physically, mentally. I feel like she's ignoring me. - I'm sorry. I guess I need to work on being more invested after an exhausting day. - There are other ways to communicate in between those stages. I mean, you could send a text message. You know, you could leave a love note, leave a sweet voicemail. You know, things like that. Staying connected is key. You know, emotional affairs exist when one spouse isn't emotionally available or present. - I guess I see my problem. I can admit I do vent to other women about our problems. - But why? They can't solve our problem. - Well now, remember Don, that a prolonged casual conversation, it can produce feelings. - I think it depends on the man. Since some men read into conversations the wrong way. - How important is intimacy for you? - Very important. Don and I used to talk for hours. I loved our connection. - My conversation with another women is not that same connection, Karen. - I'm just asking you to keep it professional so you don't build a connection. - Sweetheart, that's exactly what I've been doing. (Karen sighing) - At least, at least give me comfort in knowing that you've set boundaries. - You know, scripture says to abstain from the very appearance of evil. I mean that tugging in your spirit, I mean that's a warning. - But he wouldn't have to run if he's delivered from lust or whatever he's struggling with. - I'm not struggling anymore. I'm good, baby, I promise. I'm good. - Look. It's not too late to wait before we take that next step. Are you ready? - Yes, we're ready. We love each other. - [Pastor Holland] Karen? - Yeah, yes, we do love each other. And nothing will come between us. Nothing. - Let's do this. - [Preacher] God can give you a way of detecting faith not only in God, through confidence. - [Karen] You are still stunning even now. - [Preacher] Now, why is faith so important to you? Because faith has no limit. - I see you still have your nails painted. - There is nothing that faith cannot absolve. - It's a great color on you. I went to the doctors yesterday and - [Man] Let's look at faith for a moment as a servant. - I still... - [Man] Well let's go on over there. Let's go over with me now, - Think. - [Man] Where are we right now? - The procedure is too expensive. - [Preacher] All right, let's go over to Luke chapter 17 please. Luke chapter 17. Folks, we can have you walking so high in the spiritual realm. Do you hear what I'm saying? - But that's okay. I'll keep praying until something happens. - Get a big toe in there and just whew. That's right. Get on in there, wade around. Let it come up waist level. Come on, now. (Don sighing) - Karen. Man. (phone buzzing) - [Delissa] Karen honey? Hey, baby. - Hey, mama. - [Delissa] I was thinking about you. Brought you a little something. (Delissa giggling) - Mama, you are so good to me. - All right, okay. All right, sweetheart. Tell me what's going on. - It's happening again. - [Delissa] What's happening, baby? - The triggers. - Ah. You can always tell in the bedroom. - Ma, why did you stay? (Delissa sighs) - Um, I stayed because I loved your father. I loved your father very, very much. I mean he was good to me, he was even better to you. He was a good man. He had his faults, but you know. - Daddy is the reason I'm a caregiver. - Look baby. Regarding you and Don. Now you two made a commitment before God and before friends and family and you swore that he was the one. You gotta make a decision, baby. What does that say about you? - It says I'm confused. I just don't wanna pay for his mistakes. - The two of you are a team. (light dramatic music) You and Don are united. Which makes his mistakes your mistakes. And his fight is your fight. Which means if you want it, you gotta fight for it. Now baby, you have to make a decision. You have to stop being so confusing, okay? Well, mama has to go. The queen has a date with B16. (Delissa chuckling) - Who? - B16, Bingo, baby. Bam. (Delissa laughing) Mama got it, mama got it. The queen baby, the queen. Talk to you later, honey. - Thanks, mom. Thanks for the ice cream. - You're welcome, baby. - Yes, so they should be at the title company in the morning. They have everything. Everything for closing is done. Right, we have all of their money. Everything's been transferred to escrow. - Hey. - Hey. - This has been in my car for decades. - Aw. Thank you. I wonder what it is. - I don't know. Connie coming over? - No, she's meeting up with her ex at his house. - How did you two meet anyway? - She's Ms. Garcia's sitter. - There you go again, trying to save the world. - Thanks so much. Guess who just sold a house that your husband couldn't sell? - Congratulations. Don't leave me hanging. - Oh, a gift. Sounds light. It's probably lingerie. - It's a present to Karen. - She ain't into this. - Why would you say that? - Oh girl, please. Look miss conservative here. Uh, she ain't getting down with no lingerie. - Thanks a lot, friend. Well, I can't stay. I have to get to work, okay? Don't forget to drop off these boxes to the church. - [Dottie] I'm gonna remember, I got it, I got it. - Yeah, I'm going with you.

This was from you. - I'm sorry. (Don sighs) (thudding) - Where all this coming from, Karen? - Gosh, I can't ask a question without you being offensive. - No, you can ask me anything. It's just the way that you asking. You're not trying to pick with me tonight, are you? - [Karen] If I was, would I be wearing this? - Okay, all right, time out, time out, time out. Let's just communicate like two grown adults. We said we'd meet each other halfway, right? Right? - Okay. Dottie insinuated that I was a boring wife. - [Don] What? - Boring. Can you believe that? (Don sighs) Oh, so you agree with her? - No, that's not what I said. - Great. - I just didn't know that Dottie had that much power in our bedroom. That's all. - Well you know, I just don't know how to speak your love language. I mean, you were with other women. I feel like I have to compete with them, just so you won't be vulnerable. - And Dottie has the answer? You don't need to be those other women. Karen, they were just fantasies. You are everything to me. Hey. If you wanna know how to please me, you just have to ask. - Okay. (Karen sighs) Do I fulfill your fantasy? - Yes. Yes. And would you please keep Dottie out of our personal business? She's bitter, babe. - I don't think she means any harm. - Look, I can't tell you who to socialize with, and I'm not going to, but I will you that her negative energy, it just ain't helping us. - She said-- - Don't, don't, don't. Don't even say it, babe. Look just take my hand. Babe, take my hand. (light music) Father, I just wanna thank you right now for my wife. Thank you for everything that you're doing for us and everything that you're gonna do. We come before you tonight asking you to forgive us our thoughts. We just ask that you lead us and guide us into all truth and understanding. So we don't lean to our own, Father God, but we lean on you and we rest easy on your word. We walk by faith and not by sight. Father I ask that you just cover us right now with your precious blood so we can guard our hearts. So we can guard our marriage. In Jesus name, Amen. - Amen. Did you rush the prayer? - Well maybe just a little. But it was for a good reason though. Now come on to bed. (knocking on door) Good morning. - Morning. - You need to cover up. - You need not be looking. - You coming around your friends house dressed all-- - Boy bye, go sell a house or something. (Don sighs) Hey girl. I just seen your husband. - [Karen] Good morning. Are you good this morning? - I'm good. That was your overkill Christian friend last night. She got on my nerves. - Do you get along with anybody? - Yeah. Most people just oversensitive. How y'all doing? - Why do I get the feeling you're asking me for all the wrong reasons? - Look, you know what I believe. Once a cheater, always a cheater. - Okay, so when you make jabs like that, it makes it real difficult to remain your friend. - Well look, just because you forgave him, that don't mean I have to. - Okay, so it's gonna take you some time. But your attitude is not helping. - You know, I was talking to this girl I know, Julie, you know about your situation 'cause y'all kinda goin' through the same thing. - Wait, you're telling strangers about my personal life. - But she don't even know you. - Exactly, now she does. - I just can't sit back and watch him make a fool outta you. - Well stop watching and start praying. - Well, I'm just trying to help you. - No, Dottie, you're trying to be right. (Dottie sighing) - Well, when he hurts you again, call me. Have a blessed day. - I'll be there around 10:00. She gets on my nerves, man. - You and your mother. Stop playing Troy's stuff. - Look, don't take your frustrations out on me 'cause you mad at your mama. - Hold on girl, let me call him real quick. - [Laurie] You know you playing with fire, right? - No, be quiet, (hushes). - [Don] You reached Don, go ahead and leave your message. - He never answers the phone. Girl, when I saw Donnie at the boutique the other day I almost passed out. - Look at you, calling somebody else's husband by their nickname. - Girl, we could've worked it out. Okay, he was already separated from his wife. - [Laurie] And why was he separated? - I don't know. - Did you ask him? Oh, let me guess. You're completely different, right? - I guess so. - Then why isn't he here with you? - Look, I didn't know he was married, okay? He didn't have a ring on. - So wait, let me get this straight. Before you slept with him, y'all didn't have the conversation? - Uh, duh. I mean, you don't usually have dialog when it's a hookup. - Alexis, he took advantage of you. - No, he did not. - [Laurie] Yes, he did. - Look, I only need one more night with Donnie, okay? He'll come around. He just hasn't experienced the best parts of me. - Look, you gave up enough already. The man is married. He wasn't even there for you when you had your baby. - He didn't know he was the father, remember? - Do you know who the father is? Well somebody needs to pay. - [Alexis] For what? - 'Cause you need some help. Do you still got the receipt to the boutique? - Hi, you must be Carl. - [Carl] Hi, how are you? - Um, I'm Ms. Garcia's caregiver, Karen. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - We've been looking for her family for a long time. - I came as soon as I could. How is she? - She's blessed and highly favored. - Blessed and highly favored? Forgive me, but it doesn't look that way to me. - I know what it looks like, but we speak what we wanna see. - Christian? Hm, figures. They were inseparable. It was love in its rightest forms. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - [Karen] So where were you? - I was in London. I was in a bad place. - You seem pretty stable to me. - I look stable to you? You know nothing about me. - I know that you left her to fend for herself. - I send her cards. But when I didn't hear back from her, I thought she was dead. - I would think you would come sooner if you thought she was dead. - I came back for you, mom. I got us a house. Oh and that granddaughter you always wanted. You're gonna meet Maria. Ma, it's me. Mom? Mama? I got married now. And I came back to get you. - [Karen] She can hear you. - Mom. Mom, I miss you. Your prayers, your prayers finally worked. She squeezed my hand. She squeezed my hand. So, how long have you been taking care of her? - Uh, for a little over two years now. She also has a nursing assistant. Will you be staying? - Yes. (light dramatic music) (papers crinkling) - Good morning. - Good morning. - You are looking beautiful. - Thank you. You know I called you and your phone went straight to voicemail. - Bae, I must have feel asleep. I'm sorry. - How do you fall asleep and your wife is not inside yet? (plates clanking) - Karen, I was exhausted. You know I've been putting in a lot of hours trying to sell these houses, but I promise you, it won't happen anymore, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - So apparently, Carl, - [Don] Yeah. - He's been away getting clean. - [Don] Oh. - And he wants to take her home. - Oh no. - Yeah. - Bae, I'm so sorry. - [Karen] So what about you and the house downtown? - No, nothing yet. I do think Dottie's gonna take over the sale though. But I am working on something, so we can get the procedure done. - It's such a shame, you and Dottie used to get along so well and worked really good together. (change rattling) (change clanking) Thank you. So, do you know what today is? - It's the playoffs. That's what it is, the playoffs, yeah. (phone buzzing) That your office? - Speaking of that, I have to get to work, bae. - Okay. - But I will see you in an hour. It smells really good in here. I love you. - Yeah, ditto. (phone ringing) - Dr. Johnson's Medical Clinic, this is Kelly, how may I help you? One moment please, can you hold? Good morning. - Good morning. - [Kelly] Can I get you to sign in? - Hey listen, I'm running a little bit late for work. So, how long you think this gonna take? - I'm not really sure. Can I get you to sign in though? - Yeah, pen? - Yeah, sure. - [Don] I'm here for a paternity test. - [Kelly] Okay and your name? - [Don] Don Burbanks. - Okay great, thank you. - You know what, Alexis, you got a lot of nerve calling me up here. Why in the world did you wait so long to tell me about this? - Because I didn't know it was yours. Plus, I had two other guys tested and they were not her father. - Hold on, hold on. You were sleeping with me and two other guys? What kinda man do you think I am, woman? - The selfish type. What kinda woman do you think I am? - What if I had brought something home to my wife, Alexis? - That's your problem. You're the one in violation. You're the one that's married. I'm not. - Okay. Once I prove I'm not this baby's father. - Mm hm. - I'm gonna come pick up my wife's necklace and we done. I'm done, it's over. - She ain't gonna appreciate it anyway. And it's gonna take more than a necklace to heal that pain. - Yeah, we gonna see about that. - [Kelly] Don Burbanks. - [Nurse] Hey. I'm gonna run a mouth swab on you today. (nurse blowing) All right, for this mouth swab I'm gonna need you to open wide. Can you open for me please? Wide. Thank you, sir. All right.

I was about to be mad too. - Shall we? (glasses clinking) The girl from the boutique, she told me you liked it. So I got it for you. - I love it. - Do you really? - I miss this part about you. You remember our first date? - Yes. - When you just bought a car and you were so excited. - Yeah and I pulled up and smelled like aftershave. (Karen giggling) And I was all ready to go and Miss Delissa called everyone in the neighborhood and they couldn't go because I had no seats-- - You didn't have any backseats. - No backseats, yeah. (Don chuckling) She ruined that day for me, you know she did. That was one of the best moments of my life, Karen. - Okay. If you knew it was wrong, why didn't you just end it? - Bae, it's our anniversary. Okay. It was never my intention to cheat on you, baby. I didn't know how to end it. - So coming home to me wasn't enough to end it? - When you decided to finally take me back, the affair, the lust, the emotional ties, they all just died and I was being immature. I ended it because I love you. I stopped praying, I was just, I was so insecure. Bae, we're never gonna go back to that place. It wasn't worth it. (dog barking) I just wanna enjoy this moment with you right now. Please. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - [Don] Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. (glasses clinking) Dottie, I'm trying so hard not to be suspicious right now. - What's wrong with you? I thought it was your anniversary? - It is, but someone keeps calling my house and then just hanging up. - Like calling and holding the phone? Or as soon as you pick up they hang up? - What difference does it make? - If they call and just listen to who answers, they were not expecting you to pick up. (dramatic music) - Maybe I'll just get the, the number changed. - No, wait a minute. Let's just say it's a woman. Now, if she calls and just holds the phone, she definitely wants you to know she exists. - Why am I entertaining this? - One ring sounds like a side chick. Holding the phone, that's a baby mama. (Karen scoffs) - Don doesn't have any babies. - Once the side chick gets pregnant, the whole game changes. - What game? - When side chicks get pregnant, they demand the same treatment as the wife. (Dottie sighs) Girl, embrace yourself 'cause this might get ugly. - You know, Don isn't who you think he is anymore. - [Dottie] It sounds like she's in love with your husband. - That's impossible, it's my husband. - She's definitely breaking all the rules, I can tell you that. - [Karen] What rules? - Girl. One, a side piece can not expect a relationship to be any more than just a hookup. - What? - Number two. She cannot text or call him ever. He will contact her when he is available. Number three. Don't ever ask questions. Girl don't be stupid. (Dottie sighs) Number four. Never, ever, ever look forward to seeing him on holidays and birthdays, sit down. And number five. They must be very discreet because if the wife ever finds out, the queen, the boss, oh he will disown her like it never happened. If you really wanna know if he cheatin', girl, check his pay stubs or pop up as his job, smell his clothes, check his colognes, any of 'em missing? And look, don't forget his phone. Check all his accounts, okay? His bank account, his Twitter, his Facebook, his Instagram. - I can't, I can't do that. I can't search his, that's invading his privacy, Dottie. - What privacy? Y'all are married. Girl go home and handle your business. (Dottie scoffs) - Hi Ms. Garcia. Hey Paul. Ms. Garcia, I am so glad to be here today. Oh, what is going on with your hair? (dramatic music) Where's your? Ms. Garcia, why isn't, why isn't this in? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ms. Garcia. Okay. (Karen panting) Oh, my God. Come on. Breathe. Carl? - [Carl] What's going on, is she fine? - Carl, call 911. - What's going on? What? - Call 911. Come on. Breathe, Ms. Garcia, come on, breathe. Come on, breathe. Don't be stubborn, breathe. - Hello, yeah. What's is the address, Karen? - Come on, Ms. Garcia. - Karen, what is the address? - [Karen] 2018 Evergreen. - Two zero, two zero what? - [Karen] 2018 Evergreen. - 2018 Evergreen. - Come on, come on Ms. Garcia. - 2018 Evergreen. - Breathe. - Mom. Yes. - Come on Ms. Garcia. Can you go outside and wait for the ambulance, please? - No, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. - [Karen] Carl, please. Come on. - [Carl] Karen, if this is so serious, why is she not in the hospital? - It was your mother's wishes. Carl, go! Come on. Come on, Ms. Garcia. (door slamming) I won't give up on you, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, I need you Ms. Garcia. (Karen crying) Please. Please don't die on me, Ms. Garcia. - They're coming, they're coming don't let her die. Please don't let her die. - I'm sorry. - Please. - Oh, God. - Mom. Mom. Karen. - Please don't die. I need you. (Carl sighing) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, Ms. Garcia. (somber music) (Karen panting) Come on, Ms. Garcia. Stay with me. I need you, come on. - Karen. - Come on, come on. - Ah, for the smoothest grooviest jazz, keep your ears into the west coast. Cool 98.1 FM, catch the vibe, be cool. (jazz music) - God can give you a way - You reached Don, go ahead and leave your message. - of detecting faith. Glory to God through confidence. (audience cheering) (knocking on door) (door creaking) - Well I do have nosy neighbors. Do you wanna conduct this matter on the inside or? - Yeah. So I'm here. Where's she at? - Do you want something to drink? - No. - Eat? - No. - Okay, relax. - Relax? Okay. So uh, do you have the results? - No, not yet. - Then what? Nevermind. Is this your place? - My roommates. - Okay so, Alexis, you knew I was coming. - Look, she's not here, she's at my mother's. She's keeping her tonight. What part of not here don't you understand? She's not here, look. - What am I doing here then? - Look, you remember this picture that we took at my cousin's birthday party? - Alexis, I don't have time for this, okay? I'm gonna just dip out. - Wait, just wait. Look, I'm not gonna beg you. You know you still want me. - You know what. - Are you really gonna pass all of this up? - This was a mistake. Okay, I shoulda went with my first mind. I gotta go. Hey, come on now. - [Alexis] I thought you were working late. - [Troy] I got off early. Huh. - [Don] Roommate, huh? - No, this is actually my place. - Okay, um. Yeah, this used to be one of my properties. How you doing, man? - [Troy] Fine. - Alexis asked me to stop by. - Actually, I told you to stop by tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - You must be Donnie. Is it Donnie? - It's Don, actually. - Don, ah. - But uh, yeah man. Trust me, anything she told you, it ain't true. Not all of it. - I love your daughter. I mean, I take care of her as if she was one of our own. - Uh, okay. My daughter? You think she might be yours though? - Oh, no. I mean, no, no, no. She's a sweet kid. - All right, listen. I'm not trying to come between whatever you got going on with your daughter, okay? Y'all relationship is y'all relationship. I'm just trying to tell you, if she is mine, if she's my daughter, if she's my daughter, I want her to know who I am. - I respect that. - [Don] Cool. - I respect that. Uh, I think it's time for you to go. - Roommate, huh? You're playing a dangerous game. You gonna get somebody hurt. I'll let myself out. (Dottie sighing) You've reached Don, go ahead - You realize that your thoughts are so powerful. - And leave a message. - [Preacher] Till they draw stuff to you. Philippians 4:8, look he says, manage your mind. He says, let's, here's what I want you to think on. He says think on what to other things are. (phone buzzing) - Hey. - [Preacher] Now the children of the-- - Ms. Garcia passed away today. - Oh, my God. Karen, I'm so sorry. - [Preacher] Haven't passed yet, the power. - I've told you not to get too close to your patients. - I know, but this, she was different. - How's her son? - Yeah, he's just, he's devastated. - [Preacher] Jesus had power before Jesus came. - I feel really bad. - Where's my food? I come home around the same time. - What happened, why is Kevin yelling in the background? - It's okay. You've been through enough tonight. - Oh, my God, listen to him. He's so angry. - [Preacher] That's why the church is so powerful now. - Is he hitting you? - What, why would you say that? (Cora sighing) I don't think I love him anymore. - Who said that? - You can't just. You can't just fall out of love with somebody. Cora? - You gotta resist sin. - No, I'm here. Um, see he's settled down now. Everything is, everything is okay. - Self is more important. - I'll give you your space. but if you need me, - Resist the devil. - please call me. - Push the devil to the cliff. - Hey um, would you mind not telling anyone about this? - [Preacher] Devil to resist. - You're secret safe with me. - You are now forgiven. - I'm praying for you. - I'll see you guys tomorrow. - [Kevin] Now where is my alcohol? Did you hide it again? - [Preacher] That's enough! Today! (door slamming) (muffled preacher speaking) - What's up, Bae? - God goes so far for you. - I called you three times. - If you'll just let him think through you. He said your thoughts have not been my thoughts. - I don't know what's going on, but you better fix it. - So, till death come. - Okay, all right, I will. - [Preacher] And we're gonna allow God to think through our mind. - [Don] Just gonna freshen up. (muffled preacher talking) (light music) - [Karen] I just, I knew she was gonna make it. - Girl, I'm here for you. You know that, right? Anything you need. - Takes a strong woman to step into your shoes. We know how much she meant to you. - Well, it comes with the territory. - I need a job and a man. - For what? - I need money. I got bills. I need love. - God bless the child whose got her own. Well look, when you and Bud first separated, that's when you shoulda got your stuff together. - She's right. I mean, some couples do better after separation. - Oh, back up now. I have seen couples, you know, living like they single, shacking up, making public appearances. - It's still adultery in God's eyes. You can't approve what God disapproves. - You remember when you and Don first separated and you call yourself trying to get revenge and... No, okay, not the right time. - I haven't been able to find a good saved man. I must be cursed. - That's the problem. He should find you. - Mm hm. - Me? - Why go looking for trouble? - Oh it's no trouble. I'm gonna cater to my next husband. - Cater? All right, y'all let Beyonce brainwash y'all a little too much. - What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with that? - Please, honey. Dottie is not cooking, cleaning, ironing, and turning over at 4:00 in the morning for nobody. - Dottie. You can't be married and keep your single ways, Dottie. We're supposed to make our husbands better. - At what expense? They should be making us better too. - Oh I'll pay the cost. It doesn't feel good being alone. - Well you might as well be. If you building him up to bring yourself down. Look ladies, we are not the weaker vessels, they are. Although y'all all lookin' pretty weak right about now. - [Karen] And how'd you come up with that conclusion? - This one's divorced. This one's separated and you are yet holding on. Listen, I don't need to change my last name to prove to the world that I'm spoken for, okay? Friends with benefits work good with me. - You seem a little too intelligent to stoop so low. - You're low may not be my low. And look, married men are simple. All they need is a little convo, sports and good sex. Like I said, if you don't entertain your man, somebody else will. - And it's not your responsibility to entertain them thottie, oh I mean, Dottie. - [Dottie] Okay, calm down. That was the old Dottie. I mean, I'm saved now, I'm just sayin'. - Oh, when it benefits you. - If only I-- - Okay, no ma'am, nah. Alexis, Alexis, we need drinks. You over here, you're just, you're bringing down. You're bringing me all the way down. - Here you go, ladies. - Thank you, thank you. - Yeah, I'll take one. - Here you go, drink this. - Thank you. - All right ladies, y'all don't want none? - No. - Well let's toast. Toast to all the women who got their stuff together. And listen, once he stop tapping you at 4:00 in the morning, just know he tapping another woman-- - [Don] Hey ladies, Cora, Ms. Connie. - I hear you didn't sell that house. - No, you know what, I didn't sell the house, but I did sell the one you was trying to sell. - All right, well that's my cue. Karen, if you need me, you know where to call me, girl. Thanks for everything. (muffled talking) - Good luck on the next one. - Shut up. - [Don] How you feeling? - Much better now that you're here. - [Alexis] I'm having a blessed day. Welcome to Baccalis. - Thank you. - Um we actually have a special today. Chicken Alfredo over a creamy sauce. Would you like to try it? - I'm gonna just have a water. - A water. - Just a water, yeah. - Okay. - Same. - All right. Donnie, right? - Don, this is the lady from the boutique. - [Don] Hey, how you doing? - Great. Yeah, you know, I was actually mentioning to your wife earlier that you know, I have to work two jobs, you know, to provide for my daughter. - Sure, I'm sorry to hear about that. - You know, we actually have some more of the necklaces too. You should stop by. - No, no, no, no you shouldn't because I found a place that's closer to the house, so thank you again. - Okay. - We're good. - Dessert for you, Karen? - Um, no, I'm fine, thank you. - Okay, I'll take those menus. Thank you. Oh, you know, you have a nose just like my daughter. Hm. - Why are you so nervous? What you? - Figgity? - What you talking about? Is it hot in here? - You know, I wish I could be a fly on the wall, just to see how you are without me around. - What are you talking about? I'm not nervous at all, I'm just hot. - Is that your second look rule? Why is it so hard for you to not look at another woman? - As many times as I have to tell you, I will tell you. You are more than enough for me, baby. Okay, I'm satisfied with you. Look, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom real quick and I'll be right back, okay? - Oh, it's such a small world. Never know who you're gonna run into. - Hey, hey. - You know, we actually. - [Don] What's going on? - I'll be back with your orders. - Yeah, do that, do that. Thank you. Look, I'm not feeling good. My stomach is hurting. Is it all right if we just get outta here? - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. And you know, Karen, you just can't keep accusing me all the time. Just 'cause you think I'm doing something doesn't mean I'm doing something. I'm gonna wait for you outside. - Don. - I'm gonna wait for you outside. (light dramatic music) What? - [Pastor Holland] I think Karen is healing emotionally from the affair but it seems its just gonna take more time. - Its like my past done caught up with me, its haunting me now. I mean I finally got my life together you know, just like we talked about. I'm doing everything right but this thing here just came out of the blue. I took a DNA test and I'm still waiting on the results. - Is Karen aware of this? - You know what, Pastor, okay look, this is not just my fault. (Don groaning) (Don sighing) - Whose else fault could it be, Don? Let's not forget the pattern you follow, Don. I mean, once again you made yourself vulnerable by going to her house. - [Don] She threatened to tell Karen. Pastor what was I gonna do? - What were you thinking? - [Don] I just wanted her to tell me the truth. - [Pastor Holland] I pray that God continue to show you mercy. You cannot allow your wife to live another lie. You just can't. - I'm just waiting for the right time. - There is no right time for this news, Don. (Don sighing) (phone buzzing) Is that her? - Yeah, that's that home wrecker. - No, Don, you wrecked your own home. Well, answer the phone and let me speak to her. - All right. Hello? - [Pastor Holland] Hi there, this is Pastor Holland. - [Karen] Good morning, Carol. - Good morning. - [Karen] You read the book? - [Carol] Yeah, I read it two days. It was awesome. - [Karen] I'm glad you enjoyed it. - [Carol] Let me know when you come up with another one. - I will. What do you have for me today? You have my chart? - Yes I do. - All right, thank you. - You're welcome. - All right, keep squeezing. (baby crying) So tell me, what do you like to do? - I like to watch TV. - You like to watch TV? I'm just gonna give you a poke. It's not gonna hurt, okay? What is your favorite TV show? - I don't know. - You don't know? Good job, Ava. I have a story that my last patient left behind. Do you wanna read it? - What's it called? - Cindy's Miracle. (phone ringing) (humming) - [Donyell] Are you singing? - No, I'm just praying. Do you pray? - I used to, but I'm too old now. - [Karen] Too old? Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay? I'll be here if you need me. - Look, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay? The way you're approaching this matter is very disturbing. - I ain't trying to disrespect no one, but Donnie is not who he says he is. - Donnie? - Brother, Deacon Donnie is the father of my child. - [Pastor Holland] If you don't mind id prefer you'd call him Don. - Okay. But that's what I used to call him. - All things will be done in decency and in order, okay? I wanna help if I can. - I've tried to communicate with Don. Without telling his wife because she's so sweet. But he doesn't wanna listen to me. - Well, Alexis, I mean maybe it's the way you're communicating with him. - Look, you just don't understand. - To be frank with you, I don't understand how this happened in my church. - Pastor there is a lot of sin happening in this church. That's why I'm not a member here anymore. God, look I'm running out of time. (horns honking) - Hey, what are you doing over there? What's wrong? - You know how much I love you. - [Karen] Yes. I love you too. - [Don] My goal is to unright my wrongs. I promise you I'm a different man. - What's wrong? Why are you saying this? - [Don] I messed up. - Tell me you didn't cheat again. - No, no, I'm done with that. - Okay, then what is it? I can handle it. (light dramatic music) (Don crying) What's this? (paper crinkling) 99.9%? I thought you were satisfied? - [Don] I am, Karen, I am. - [Karen] What else do you want from me, Don? - [Don] We were separated. I thought I'd lost you forever. - How old is she? How old? - Five. Five years old. - Oh, my God. - No, Karen, just wait for a sec. Karen, you changed me. No other woman could have done that. - No, Don, no other would've, no, no other woman would have stayed around as long as I did. Open that. - Yeah, this is exactly what we need. Let's just pray. - Read Ruth 1:16. Read it. You can't even find it, huh? 'Cause those are our vows you couldn't keep. You failed me. You obviously failed God and now you failed us. I'm leaving you. - Karen, Karen! (jazz music) Why! - Double word. (Dottie laughing) - Hey girl. - You didn't tell. - Hey. - You didn't tell me you have company when I called. - Don't worry about it, you okay. - Your turn. - Oh, good. Hm, sit down, look. I already got you ready. - No, water. - No, I just wanna make a toast-- - Water, Dottie, no. - Just one toast. - I'm so, whatever, okay. (Dottie clearing throat) - I'd like to make a toast to the awakening of my dear sweet friend, Karen. She has finally seen the light. She free y'all, she single. Come on, drink up.

Guess they must have had the wrong number. - That's her, mom. - Who? - Her. - [Mr. Thicket] You got her calling the house? - Now I know you of all people should understand what I'm going through right now. Karen she, she don't wanna fight for our marriage no more. - But is this the battle you wanna keep fighting? - It ain't battle. The fight over. - Look, you're tearing this girl's heart into pieces. - You don't have any children with her. Just let it be. - [Mr. Thicket] Honey. - Why are you so against Karen? What did she do to you, mama? - It's his life. - I told him to marry Pam. She's pretty, smart. - I didn't love Pam. I love Karen. - Look, you have got to learn to control your mouth. - [Mrs. Thicket] I'll see you later. I love you, son. - I love you too, mama. - Son, just get yourself together. And if you can't, just let her go. (Kevin groaning) - Hi, I'm Karen. - [Kevin] Kevin, I'm with maintenance. - Oh. - I'll be finished in a minute. The pipe was clogged up. (water dripping) You know, I've heard a lot about you. - If Dottie said anything about me, Probably 99% of it is overexaggerated. (both chuckling) - I hear you're going through a divorce. I've been divorced for over five years myself. - Do you have any kids? - [Kevin] Huh? - Kids? - No, no, well. I mean not yet. But I would like to have maybe two or three one day. Hey, I happen to own a restaurant that serves the best barbecue in the state, hands down. You wanna meet up later? - Oh, okay. Thank you, but I'm working tonight, so. - Oh, yeah I understand. But I live just upstairs in apartment 10. So, if you change your mind or wanna catch up later-- - I'm not trying to be rude but, I'm really okay. I'm not interested. - Okay. Wow. He's a lucky man and you're a very beautiful woman. Loyal too, I see. - [Karen] Well thank you. I'm still married, you know. Just going through some problems. - Hey. I see you met our maintenance guy. And you know Kevin owns a-- - Yeah, a restaurant. It was nice to meet you. - You too. She's not into me. (Dottie sighing) (door slamming) - [Dottie] Get dressed. - Where we going? - Don't ask no questions, just get dressed. I'll wait for you in the car. - Where are we, are you gonna tell me whose house this is? - [Dottie] Don't worry about it, come on. (knocking on door) - Welcome. - Sit down. (lighter clicking) - First time out of your comfort zone, I see. I like to tell my clients that I pull from my intuition, and I do this to give insight to troubled souls. - Before we go any further. She wanna know if you believe in God. The Father, God. - You don't know and you got me sitting here? Have you even been here before? - Girl, no. I'm not opening myself up to all this foolery. - There's a lot of emotional pain, but it doesn't have to be. (change clanking) I feel that you would do anything to turn back the hands of time, but it would do no good. It would happen the same way as it did the first time. Some things are just meant to be, but some things are provoked. - So where do I stand? - When your life unfolds, you'll understand that the calamities that were allowed into your life, did not come to destroy you. - [Karen] Oh really? - There's coming a time when your faith will be tested, and you're going to need to make a very difficult decision. - I'm so lost right now. (Karen hushes) - Dottie. - Your friend says you should mind your own business. Only be careful not to so discord or disrupt your friend's energy. Tread lightly. - What do you mean? - Would you like for me to be of assistance to you too? - No. - No, girl, just give me a little bit more change. - [Karen] Dottie, that's enough. We're done here. Thank you. - I'll see you real soon. ♪ Hear my voice oh God ♪ ♪ Preserve my love from the enemies ♪ ♪ Hide me from the wicked ♪ ♪ Cover me ♪ - What are you doing? I thought you were still asleep. - I am cleansing your home. Now your free spirit really scares me sometimes. - Oh, you find anything? Karen! - What? What, what happened? - I just, I'm gonna bring the maintenance guy back his thingies. - I know what you're trying to do. - Oh, what? You're just, you're not the least bit interested in Kevin? - No, Dottie, no. - Well, okay, well. I'll be right back. - So this is what you were hiding. Oh, Dottie. (phone buzzing) Hello? Oh, well that's today? Yes, yes. Okay, I'm on my way. Thank you. - I'm certainly gonna miss your mother. She was such a wonderful woman. - [Carl] I know, I'll miss her too. - Yes, so much. (knocking on door) - Hi. - Hey. Welcome. - Just take a seat. I'll be right back. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm hanging in there. How are you? - One day at a time. I miss her. - I miss her too. I finally got her paperwork and property in order. I just wish I could've come sooner. - You came when she needed you. She didn't die alone. - I think she was waiting for me. - You're probably right. - From now on, I'm gonna live my life differently. I mean you never know. Today you're here, tomorrow you're gone. - When are you leaving? - Today. Connie's gonna bring me to the airport, but it was a pleasure knowing you. - [Sloan] Hello, everyone. Should I get started? - Please, carry on. - Okay. - We're here today to read the last will and testament of Ms. Garcia. I'm Attorney Sloan. Before she passed away and she became mute, she insisted that she include you, Miss Karen, in the will. So, should I continue? - Please, carry on. - Okay, Ms. Garcia left these final words for you. Sweet Karen, before I became mute, I have seen your tears and heard your prayers. When you thought I was sleeping, I was listening. Singing to me in the middle of the night helped my fears of transitioning. In some strange way, you understood me. You took care of my fragile body, you made me comfortable. There are plenty of things I regret. One of them was not giving my husband a child, but you allowed me to somehow feel like a parent. Being a mother is priceless. It's the greatest gift you could ever give to your husband. I want you to experience the magic that I did not. So I have left you $100,000. I want you to find your way in life and be happy. I want you and Don to win. You two were made for each other. Now how do I know? I just know it. Goodbye my precious daughter. - Don. - Hey. - It's Pastor Holland over here. Praise the Lord, brother. How you doing? - [Don] Blessed and highly blessed, Pastor. - Good, good. Hey listen, I need to meet with you and your immediate family. - Okay, uh-- - Now. - [Don] Yeah okay, is everything okay? - It will be. Okay, God bless. (Don sighing) - Okay. You look amazing. - Thank you. I thought I'd just use my key. - It is still our home, so. I tried calling and texting for weeks. Baby, I've been missing you like crazy. - Don, I-- - Look, no, I know you hate what I've done to us. You probably even hate me, but I still, I still love you, Karen. - Did you, did you make spaghetti? - I was just trying to impress you, but I guess not. - Did you burn it? (Karen laughing) - It's funny, huh. I'm so nervous and I just, I've been missing you so-- - One more second, I know that this weather will go. Got me all bent out of shape and-- - This is Texas, you know? - Why didn't you wear your jacket? - Oh it's fine, it's fine. (knocking on door) - Hold that thought. - You could still coulda worn it, you know people gonna come-- - Hey mama. - Hey baby, how you doin'? How's my baby? Oh smells like you done burnt the spaghetti. So, you're back home? - [Mr. Thicket] Hello, young lady. Good to see you. - Hi, Mr. Thicket, how are you? - [Mr. Thicket] You need any help? - No, daddy, we good. Y'all go ahead and have a seat. We got it. Let me get it. (knocking on door) - Hey, how is everybody? - [Don] Good, good. - [Delissa] Hi. - Let's go ahead and join hands. Okay. Heavenly Father, we come before you to thank you, Lord, for your presence that's amongst us today. Lord may the words from our mouths and the meditation in our hearts be pleasing and acceptable to you today. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. - [All] Amen. - Amen. All right, so as you know we're here to come together and show support to Karen and Don. - Yes and it's a sin and a shame. - Well, why don't we start off with you Delissa. - I really like Don. I mean, after all he is my son-in-law. But the fact is he ruined this marriage. - No, I didn't. - I think y'all should have waited before y'all got back together. - Now that I do agree with. - You see, Don, was not ready for marriage. He was too busy sowing his oats. - Well your daughter wasn't so well put together either. If I might add. Every time I looked around, Don was over at our house sleeping. - And did he tell you why? Did he tell you that he had all kind of women in their home? - Why are bringing up the past right now? Yes, I had my problems, but we were working through it. - Oh, let's see. You stop working, you had a child born out of adultery and you came back home as if you did nothing wrong. - The boy got lonely. - And very careless. You know terminal diseases still exist you know. - Your daughter got lonely too. She ain't no saint. - Mom, no. It's not the time. - No, she's not. But she is loyal to your son. - Oh you don't know? You don't know that your daughter had an abortion? - My daughter would never do anything like that. - Oh yeah, she call herself trying to play catch back. She ain't a saint. Are you pleased with the way she turned out? - I'm very pleased with my daughter. - That's why I think my son deserves better. - Well you know the old saying that, if you want better, you gotta do better. - I agree, but can we just stick to the-- - I gave you my daughter. God bless her father in heaven. I trusted you, Don. I trusted that you would do the right thing. If my daughter wasn't good enough for you, then you should've waited until she was. You know your cheating ways they, they caused her to be so insecure. They made her feel worthless as a wife. - Well if she had known her worth before she got married, she wouldn't feel that way. - Trust and believe she knows her worth. That's exactly why she thought she could help your son. - My son has a weakness. - A weakness? A man committing adultery, he ain't weak. He's selfish, immature and greedy. - It wasn't like he could come home and confess that weakness to his wife, now could he? - Well if he had, then perhaps he could've been delivered. You do know that two is better than one? - She knows that woman meant nothing to me. - Oh, well I'll be darned. - All that other stuff doesn't matter. Don is better man because of this young lady right here. - Thank you, Mr. Thicket. - The bottom line is that you two need to work out your problems together. - Look at you guys. You sound like you're hurting worse than this couple right here. We're here to help support this innocent child. I'm afraid there's not much time. - What's the rush, Pastor? - I'm not trying to rush the process, Don. - Maybe it's God's way of giving Karen a child since she can't have one of her own. - Now, Mrs. Thicket, God was not involved in the act of this adultery here. Okay? But know this, that whatever went wrong here, God can make it right. Your daughter has a serious disease. - What, what are you saying? - I'm saying that if she doesn't get the help that she needs right now, she could be in trouble. Now, Don and Karen, I suggest you go ahead and make an appointment with the doctor so that you can learn about this disease and how you can help. There's just one thing left to do. - What now? - She doesn't have any money. We're her only hope. I'll take a collection from the church as soon as I can. - Okay, thank you, Pastor. - You bet. - Baby. - Karen, just be happy you're getting a step-daughter. Listen. - No, you listen. I understand I'm not your ideal daughter-in-law, but have you ever wondered why your son fights so hard for this marriage? - I guess because he feels obligated? - No. (light dramatic music) It's because I'm good to him and he knows it. I've waited a long time for you to approve our marriage. For you to at least... For you to at least thank me for cleaning up the mess you left behind. Now I know that's not gonna happen. Now I know who taught him how to love. (door slamming) (Don sighs) - Hey. Did we just talk all night? - Yeah. Yeah we did. - Just like old times. - Just like old times. (Don sighs) - I, I got my best friend back. Karen, you are my soulmate. (phone buzzing) - You can answer it. - No, it can wait. You are the most important thing to me right now. I miss you so much, Karen. I love you. (phone buzzing) - You can answer it, it's okay. I trust you. - Okay. I'm gonna go get some breakfast, you want some? - Okay. - All right. - Give me a smile. (Alexis sighing) Do you know that you mean everything to me? (somber music) You know, I'm not proud of everything that I've done. I just need you to hold on, baby. Please. Who gave you this? - My nurse. She says that Jesus loves me. She taught me how to pray. She says God is real. - Mm hm. Yeah, she's right. It is, baby. It is. - Cora? Are you almost here? Okay. Okay, bye. (door slamming) - What's wrong? - Don left with his new family. Can you believe that? - With his new family? Well, why didn't you go with him? - What was I supposed to do? I just told him to go ahead. - So you sent your husband away, vulnerable again? (Cora sighs) Do you know where he is? If you're gonna fight like this, we're gonna lose this battle. - I don't know if I have what it takes to compete. - Who are you competing with, his child? Karen. (Cora sighs) What makes you so insecure? You are his wife. You are his family. - It's, it's just the not knowing. I just-- - Let me tell you how you should feel. You should feel angry, hurt, frustrated and even confused, but you have got to get outta your feelings. So, why are you freaking out? You did come back home with a plan, right? (light dramatic music) If you're gonna stand by your man, then stand. But if you can't... Your work here is done. - This is just not gonna go away is it? - I'm afraid not. This is what you walked back into. - Only believe. So the little girl believed. What's wrong? - Am I gonna die? - No. - [Carol] Hey, can you put this form in the chart? - Um. How is she doing? - Not so good. Prayer helps. Keep praying. (dramatic music) (clipboard thudding) (Karen crying) - Honey. Can you wake up for me, sweetheart? Just for one second. Honey is your, is your mom, is your mom's name Alexis? Is her name Alexis? Does your mom work at a boutique? (light dramatic music) (Karen crying) - [Carol] Are you okay? (banging on door) - I need to talk to you. (lighter clicking) - I can sense that it is all unfolding now. - I need you to repeat exactly what you said the last time I was here. - Honey, I speak to so many people. I don't quite remember. (change clanking) - Do you remember now? - Oh yes, the skeptic friend. - I'm so confused. - What are you-- - I could be a part of a miracle or I can help support my own miracle. - What were you instructed to do? You keep losing battles because you both lack oneness. You know the truth. Stop following what is in your heart and do what's right in your spirit. Only be courageous. Tend to your faith. - But I don't know what to do. - [Simone] You know the truth. (dramatic music) (Troy laughing) - Hey Alexis. Hey Alexis. Have you been in my collection? - No. - I don't need them parts around here. - No, he know I've been out here, girl. I've been out here for two hours. - Okay, this way. What, what, come on, what's wrong? Come on, man, it's just like old times. Just you and me, you know? We got this, we got this. Look, look, look, I'll make a deal with you. If Don is innocent, I'll, I'll apologize and I won't interfere again. But look, if he's not, you need to promise me you gonna leave him. - Don is innocent, I just know it. - Well let's see. - I can't. - Come on, come. (knocking on door) (swanky music) - Is Alexis home? - [Troy] Alexis. - What are you two doing here? - I think it's time for us to reintroduce ourselves. You knew who I was all this time. - No ma'am. I didn't know who you were until I saw you at the restaurant. - That's a lie. You knew who they were at church. You knew this was his wife. - Listen, things got out of hand, okay? That's why I left church after I got pregnant. - Oh. I guess some folks really do get around then, huh? - You don't know me. - Right, mm hm. Just another baby mama victim I guess. - Karen's the victim, not me. - Listen, we're all victims. We were all ignorant and what the devil meant for evil, God is gonna get the glory. - Look, Don came by here the other night to get the DNA results and judging by his actions, I guess he really did change. - I know and I'm quite sure he behaved like my saved husband and not like the man you knew from the past. - I was there that night. Ain't nothing happened. - See? - Let's just clear the air. As a mother, I can't imagine how difficult it was for you to keep your precious daughter a secret after all these years. - I just didn't know who the father was. - What? Look you need to not be walking around telling people that. - As a single woman, Alexis, I was so desperate. I settled for anybody who paid attention to me. I get it, but as a wife, as a woman of God, I'm a good woman, a solid woman. I'm not here to judge you, but I'm not going anywhere. - Yeah, that's right because they're in love. That's her husband, she's his wife, and you know Mark 10 and nine says where therefore what God has joined together. I'm just trying to give her. - My intentions were not to hurt you. - Yeah well, your good intentions made for some bad decisions. - Alexis, I would really appreciate it if you don't discredit me to Donyell. Let's just handle this like adults. - Wait, what'd you say? No one's ever called her by her first name before. Thank you. I mean that. She adores you. - You're welcome. One more thing. I wanna tell my husband that you and I are okay. - [Alexis] I am okay. (jazz music) (humming) - And Troy, come get your stuff out my house. - I don't know what the heck she's talking about. - You guys are making this out to be a bigger deal. It's really just, I don't know, some type of virus. - [Delissa] Where's Don at? - He's with Donyell. I told him I'll meet 'em later. - Dottie and I are working on our relationship. Look, we both love you. So, we decided to grow up. - Wait, what? What is this? - I'm just saying, I may have seen the light and I've decided to be a better friend instead of a bitter one. - Anyway, honey, I know you're not gonna agree with this but you've been sick for weeks and I just thought that maybe? - Mom, I'm not pregnant. Maybe, maybe Don's mom was right. - Baby, I'm not bashing what you did, but you did give the money away to have my grandchild. - Please, pretty, pretty please take the test. If you're not pregnant, we'll just pretend like none of this ever happened. - Okay, okay. But if I take it, will you guys leave me alone? - We promise. - Okay. (Cora sighs) (Delissa giggling) (Dottie whistling) - How long does it usually take? - [Dottie] Like two minutes. - Two minutes. - So I've read. - Uh huh. Baby you okay in there? (toilet flushing) - Yeah. I'm not pregnant. I've told you I was not pregnant. - I'm sorry. You had all the symptoms and I just. - Don't ever do that to me again. - Oh, Lord. - Oh, my God. God, hold up, hold on. - What? - Hold on, hold on, hold on. Uh, that is, that's two lines. - Wait, let me see. - That's two lines. - I only saw one line. - Oh, baby, no. No, it's two lines, Karen. - That's impossible. - Sweet Jesus, no more saving pennies. (all giggling) - Oh, my gosh. - I'm pregnant? - Yes. - [Delissa] This is so exciting. - Lean not to your own understanding, you shall reap if you faint not. Ah. - Oh, my God, I have to call Don. (Karen sighs) Hey Don, um, I'm not trying to complicate things. - [Don] Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's fine. No, no, no, no, no, it's not that. - Hey. - Yeah? - Yes, hey um, Don, I'm gonna need you to jump in the car and get over here right now. - Right now? - Yes, right now. - Okay. - Okay, bye. (all giggling) (all cheering) Oh, my God, this is so exciting. - Oh, my gosh. - What? - Oh, my God. My life has unfolded. I must have made the right decision. She was right. Oh, my God. - Who was right? - She was right. Oh, my gosh. - Where are you going? - Um... Tell Don to meet me at Mother Simone's. - Who, who is Mother Simone? Where is she going in her pajamas? - That's your child. - [Karen] You were right. - Hey there. - Pastor Holland. - Finally your life has unfolded. - I wasn't aware that you two knew each other. - Um, but I thought she was? - [Pastor Holland] A gifted young lady is who she is. Called and appointed. - No disrespect, Pastor, but my friend brought me here to get a reading. - You make her sound like she's some sort of psychic or something. Mother Simone is a prophet. Loves the Lord with all her heart. - I'm sorry, but why do you take money? - Oh, I was actually here to bring Mother Simone groceries. Mother Simone is blind. She can't see. This is how she supports herself. - I didn't say I healed the physical body. I heal troubled souls. Congratulations. - Hey, what's going on? - Hey. Um. - Karen, are you okay? Talk to me. - I'm pregnant. (Don panting) - We're pregnant? (Karen giggling) (Don gasping) - [Karen] I'm pregnant. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What about the surgery? - I don't know um, I mean I've been sick all week-- (Karen giggling) - I love you. - I love you. - [Don] I love you so much. - We won't lose this one, okay? We can't lose this one. We can't lose this one. - God has shown favor upon this couple. Hallelujah. Let's bless this little miracle. (upbeat jazz music)
