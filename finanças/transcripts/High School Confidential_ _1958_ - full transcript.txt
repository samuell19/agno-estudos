Hey, wise-guy! I was going to park there, big-shot. The name is Baker. B-A-K-E-R. And I park where I want. - That space is mine. You got 32 teeth, buster. You want to try for none? Hiya, sexy. You look real cultured. Let's cut to some drag-and-eat pad, huh? Oh, wow. Cool it. - What's that, chum? Beat it. You want to start a rumble? Drop it, buster. - The name is Tony Baker. And maybe the chick here likes me to hold her arm. Come on now, Joanie. I put it down but you ain't picking it up. Maybe later. Yeah, dad. Much later. Oh, man. Don't be so fast to start a rumble with the president of the Wheelers & Dealers. You know who that is? - No. Well man, that is J.I. Coleridge. I didn't know that, man. So J.I. is the top stud around here, huh? Kid, if you get in with the Wheelers & Dealers and .. You will be a top stud yourself. I got news for you, man. Before this crummy day is over .. Every crummy stud in this whole crummy school will know who Tony Baker is. See, I don't join them, man. They join me. Dig me? - I dig you. I'm putting it down. - I'm picking it up. Come on. I never saw him before. Did you? No, but he is a real character. Sounds like you are interested. Where is the warden? If you mean Mr Robinson, he'll be back in a minute. Take a seat. I'm looking to graze on some grass. What? Okay, chick. I guess I dialled the wrong number. Young man. Me? Who do you think? I don't know. Got no time to play guessing games. Give me that. Watch out. That weed may be too strong for you. Would you prefer a cigarette? What? You know, if you were 20 years younger I'd hate to be stuck with you on a date. Why of all .. - Now, don't flip your lid. What do you want here? A transfer from Ross High in Chicago. Come here. I see you live with your aunt and uncle. That's the way the bongo bingles. Please leave those papers alone. Your scholastic record is very bad. So what? I'm no teacher zombie. This is your seventh year in high school. Two as a junior and three as a senior. I know. And two more years for Uncle Sam. So let's skip the ancient history. What's the scoop now? If you are trying to create an impression. I am unimpressed. There is a 2-dollar deposit for a year's supply of gym towels. Got change for a twenty? I think you had better see our principal Mr Robinson when he returns. And please take this to your home room. Thanks. Give me a ring, doll. Now, some slang words have been accepted as correct English usage. But slang is such a temporary thing that it is apt to fade into non-existence. It's hard to tell beforehand whether a word will live or die. Slang itself changes with each successive generation. A 15th century student for instance might say that .. Columbus believed the world was round instead of square. However, today the word .. "square". Has an entirely different connotation. [ Wolf whistle ] Do you belong in my class? And you belong in my class too, doll. You know, for a teacher you are pretty cool. Why don't we cut out and go to your pad and live it up, huh? Class, please. Take a seat. And be quiet. Hiya, kitten. I said be quiet. Now let's take the slang word: "scram". It originated with the verb "scramble". To move about on your hands and knees. The slang word scram means .. To get out or to go away. You will find the word in your dictionary. Whether or not you should use the word is another question. I know the answer to that question, Teach. I don't remember asking a question. Look. You know you could be the most but .. I mean all that old-style jive you got written up on the board is nowhere. I will tell you when to speak. Look, take it from this stud will you. I mean that stuff is strictly for the tinners that live around the block. Look, if I were to say to this kitten here. If I were to say .. Let's blow this joint. Let's hop in my car and take off for the Kasbah. Will you shut up. Okay. Okay, I'll break it off but I just want you to know it takes a lot out of me. I don't want you to call me Doll. My name is Miss Williams. - Why be so formal? I mean you can call me Tony. Or Daddio. I've had enough of this. You will report to Mr Robinson with me right away. Slam bam, thank you, ma'am. So, it's back to the Warden's office. Huh, doll? For the last time, will you stop calling me Doll. That is no way to talk to the future president of the Wheelers & Dealers. Man, I've got the gold to take her on a trip to cloud nine. Here. Come on, cats. Cool it. Come on now. Cool it, cats. How would you like J.I. to lay a little history on you? You heard that swell bit she put down about Christopher Columbus our founder. Now, I ask you. Is this a bring-down? Yeah. Columbus. Why man, he was the hippest. Now one swinging day when Chris was sitting at the beach goofing. He dug that the world was round. And with this crazy idea stashed in his lid .. He swung over to the royal pad for a few touches with cool-chick Queen Isabella. Who was a swinger. They all took a long look at him and said: Christy. What is this jazz you putting down about our planet being round? She said everybody is hip that it is square. The only thing square about this world are the cats what live it. He said: now look I'm in your pad for one swinging reason. He says I know I can make it east by swinging west. Now, I don't want to take some non-stop studs .. To go in a deep pool of water with me and maybe come up with a New World bit. If I'm straight. Where everybody swings. And if I goof and run into any of them flip Indian kiddies over there. I can sit down and smoke a little pipe. And who knows baby, maybe run off with deeds to a groovy piece of real estate. She said: Crazy man. But like this is a sick bit you win. And if you find out that the world is square. This is why it is easy baby. We just tool off the deep end dig a little infinity. That's all. Now Isabel. He says: Dig me hard, baby. He says: I know you are hung with the affairs of the court jab. He says: But I need scoffing for this trip. He says: Baby, and that takes bread. And in the bread department I am nowhere. She said: Man .. Man, you are like a real bring-down. So you pump me up with that crazy story and expect me to spring for the gold? She says: You just cooled the whole bit. She says: you know the kingdom is next to Tapsville. And if I ever lay this story out on my old man, why he'll flip out. You know how square Bernie is. He said: Belle, listen baby. You are the swinging-est chick in the whole mother kingdom. And I'll bet than if anyone can score for the bread it's you. Well kiddies, the next morning she came up with a real wicked plan. To hock the royal house. And after Chris met his boat connection and scored for three. He got some cats together with eyes for adventure and split across the Atlantic. And go, tomorrow-style. That is very interesting. Take your seat. Mr Robinson. Just a moment, please. We've got a problem in there. A new student. A boy who is without doubt the most arrogant, insulting, indecent .. Don't get excited, Mrs Dodge. We've had problems before. - But not like this one. I usually handle them. Get out of my chair. Okay baldy, you'd better sit down anyway before you fall down. Man, you look like you've been goofing off. I'll take that. Right now. Don't cut yourself now. That thing you are smoking. Get your feet off the table. Just what are you trying to accomplish? I don't dig it. Oh, I see. Dig me. I've no objection to your hip talk or hep talk .. Or whatever it's called at the moment. But in my office let's talk just plain, old-fashioned English. It will help us understand each other. - Man, what is there to understand? Come to the point. You are dragging your rear axle in waltz time. I haven't any idea what you have been saying. Well, what I've said is .. And don't make a profession out of rudeness. And no more knives. If I ever hear of you having one I will report to the juvenile authorities. Now go back to your classes. Thanks. For nothing. Hello Tony darling. Hi, auntie. Are you getting up or going to bed? How did it go at school today? It went. If you would rather have coffee Tony there is a pot of fresh. No thanks. I think I'll cut out and size up this townsville. You're looking for excitement? Why not? I am a citizen. I hate to think you running around all by your lonely. Hey, I'm a big boy now. I even go out with girls. That's why I worry. Thinking about you coming up against those young, tight sweaters. You ought to know. Stop treating me like a stranger. With Vic out of town it is lonely. Relatives should always kiss each other hello and goodbye polite-like. You are getting paid for my room and board. But not enough. Tomorrow afternoon when you have your usual coffee brandy. Why don't you put a little more coffee in your brandy and coffee, huh? Goodbye now. Now, you can see the difference between a real cigarette and marijuana. And there will be no mistaking the texture or contents. If you were to handle it. The darker once has been rolled in wheat-straw paper. In most of the reefers a double thickness of paper is used. Now, in the language the addicts use among themselves. Marijuana is referred to as "Mary Jane", "Pot" .. "Weed" or "Tea". They never say to each other: let's smoke a marijuana cigarette. They say: let's turn on or let's blast a joint. Commissioner, don't you think that you are .. Magnifying his issue? A marijuana cigarette. Was found on the floor of one of your classrooms. And another was found in the Girls Gym. And that is enough to start a big crusade in Santa Bella High? Mr Burrows, please understand. Miss Williams, like many of us believes in the progressive theory. That there is no such thing as a bad boy or girl. Well. There is a high school in Indiana. I don't know whether they followed your progressive theories or not. They had no problem three years ago. But out of a total enrolment of 1,200 students. 285 were found to be using marijuana or heroin. And this dreadful condition. Was only uncovered through a horrible accident. One student. Desperate for money to pay for his habit. Sold bennies for quarters and dimes. To kids in elementary school. It was the death of a 13-year old. Who had been addicted to marijuana and then to heroin. That exposed the ugly facts. But by that time. It was too late for forty-one teenagers who were addicted. It can happen here. Oh man, like everybody is talking about you. Yeah? - Yeah, you're famous. You want to make some bread? - Yeah, I'm picking up. But are the Wheelers & Dealers? - They are your type. I thought you were good people. Tell me something. Is that doll J.I.'s parking pet? - She sure is. What's her name? - Joan. I dig pretty kittens. Especially rich pretty kittens. J.I. is pretty rough. In my book man, he is a Shmoe. From cocomon. - From cocomon. Hi. I am Steve Bentley. That's too bad. I'm president of the Rangers. Well I'm sorry, but I'm looking for some real action. We get most of the football players. No, no. A different kind of action. Okay, see you around. Why not? Hiya, darling. Tony Baker. - My name is Mary Jane Ann. Mary Jane. Well you've pulverized me. Hey Petey, you know what this girl's name is? Mary Jane. Oh yeah? Mary Jane is a crazy name. It just makes me frantic. Mary Jane, we've got to get together sometime and have a ball. What do you say, doll? Well, I have been going steady for .. - I dig competition. And I sure get my kicks from saying your name. Mary Jane. Its hip, man. I'll take care of the tab. And I'd also like to by dessert for all the cool cats. Gee, thanks. I tried to get you last night. I know. I was on a cruise in the big city. I am dry. I just don't know what I am going to do. Gee, I wish I could help you Joanie. But what can I do? Hi, people. May I sit down? Thanks. Petey, why don't you sit there. The school is sure getting a low class client?le. What's your beef, man? I just want to play friends. Is that a crime in this state? Or are you just afraid of a little competition? Well, talk up man. I don't sound you at all. Now look what you have done. You've gone and made the kid nervous. Come on, let's be henchmen. I'll make you vice president of the Wheelers & Dealers. Maybe I'll even make you executive vice president. What is the good word, Joan? If you dig me like I dig you. Stop that, Baker. She is my girl. I got a scoop for you, J.I. Things are changing around here as of today. What's the matter, Joan? You feeling sick? Looks like Joan has got a bad case of the screaming mimmies. It looks like Joan is none of your business. Ah, you are not tuned in, J.I. I am making it my business. You're looking for some awful bad trouble, boy. Maybe. Maybe. Why don't we make a meet and settle this personally? We're going to be settled. My way. J.I. looks rough and ready. Well, if I'm going to take over 1 might as well start right now. You know, that Joan is a sick girl. You know what I mean, don't you, weed-head? Yeah, I know what you mean. Hello there, Baker-boy. You said you want some action. Yeah, but just between you and me. Why this here is just some of the Wheelers & Dealers. I kinda figured if you want to take over, now is the time to do it. I will just stand here and watch the fun here. That way I don't get no blood on my pants. Alright, fellahs. That's right. Play it cool. You know I lost one of these things in a principal's office. I don't want to lose another one in one of your bellies. So don't be foolish, chums. Or I'll let the air out of all of you. Now school is over so why don't you all go home? And tell the rest of the Wheelers & Dealers that they've got a new Prez. Go on, beat it. Quite a big guy with that aren't you, Baker. Big enough to take over. I'll make a deal with you, J.I. I'll let you be vice-president, even treasurer of the weed-heads at school. If you don't stay away from Joan. Even that thing isn't going to help you. Hey, Teach. Do you want a push? I think my battery is dead. Well, hop in. Come on. Leave it there. I'll give you a lift home in a real cab. I don't want to impose on you. What's the matter, are you scared? I'll call the auto club. Who are you afraid of? Me or yourself? You don't have to worry. I'll see that you behave yourself. I mean, after all a teacher has got to behave like a teacher. Okay. I will .. I will call the auto club from home. Thanks. I wouldn't want you to fall out. I am afraid I am taking you out of your way. Don't be silly. I just happened to be going your way. And which way is "my way"? Any old way. This is very sweet and thoughtful of you. A crack like that could hurt a guy's reputation. How about stopping for a beer? Aren't you under age? Well, maybe I can pass for a teenage adult. What is your angle? Is there a law that says a guy has got to have an angle? You always seem to me to be trying to prove something. Teach, it is all in your mind. Is it really? I'm not the one that tried to disrupt the class. I didn't go in the principal's office with a cigar and a knife. I'm afraid you wouldn't look very good with a cigar. You are just not the type. What is your type? I am the "satisfied" type. No, you are not satisfied. - Oh yes I am. No. You're not satisfied. That's why you always try to make people notice you. You want to be considered important. Okay, have it your way. But when I checked into this crummy school Monday, I was just another kid. Now everybody in that school knows who Tony Baker is. Who is he? I'll soon be president of the Wheelers & Dealers. Does that mean so much? To be the leader of a small group of would-be hoodlums. You got a better offer? I mean like being a .. President of the Arlene Williams personal service club. That's not a bad idea. Maybe we'll start with a beer, huh? I am sorry I brought it up. Turn at the next corner. Are you expecting me to act like a gentleman? No. I wouldn't want to give you a nervous breakdown. Ooh, you are getting a sense of humor. Hey, I'll pick you up in the morning. My car will be finished then. I know. But we got a lot of things to talk over. Do we? What? I don't know. I'll figure out something. Well, when you find out let me know. I'll be glad to meet you. In the classroom. Goodbye. Thanks for the ride. Baby, you look like you got the shock-horrors. J.I. I've got to get a stick. Money can buy anything. - I'm clean. I've used up my whole allowance. I can't ask my dad for any more advances. Well that is soft toenails, I mean. Why bug me with your sad story? It's your problem where you get the gold. What do you want me to do, steal it? Crazy. I knew you would come up with something cool. Do you really expect me to steal? Now come on, Joan. It was your idea, not mine. Did you cop a look in the principal's office? You're switching channels on me. The records only show that he is a transfer from North High. An orphan living with his aunt on Seaton Street. I've got to get a stick from Jukey. J.I. Won't you lend me the money? If you need the money, try the merino gimmick. Stop bugging me. I'll take those two dresses, Kitty. Very well, Miss Staples. The usual charge, kid. Mr Morino. Miss Staples would like to charge these two dresses. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Miss Staples, your taste makes our business a sheer delight. Believe me. Don't overplay it blabbermouth. Joan didn't try anything on. Let's see. Adorable, adorable, adorable. As soon as the alterations are done we'll send it right out to the house. Alright? Would you sign here please, Miss Staples. Thank you, Miss Staples. - Thank you. Did you get the new import in yet? - Yes, I did. One and one alone. It's for you dear and it is hanging right in the back there. This is adorable. This is you. You. Turn around, dear. Lovely, lovely. Here you are. Only fifteen? - Tough. These dresses cost fifty each retail. We have them marked up at seventy-five. We can't go any higher. After all, your father's secretary isn't that much of a dope. Yes, but last time you gave me .. - This is it. If you want a cash kickback and .. If me and Morino are to be paid for our services. But only fifteen? - Take it or leave it. You never know when the set-up backfires and when it does we get hurt, not you. So. Do you want the cash or do you want the cash? You are a crook. Aren't we all? I'm still short twenty. Look sugar, I spoke to Jukey like you told me. And he said he wanted all the green stuff. I stuck my neck out to do you a favor. What more can I do? Why shouldn't he give me a break? Didn't he turn me on? Come on, you turn yourself on. You ought not to talk like that. You know, he might get mad at you. My old man was a bread-stasher all his life. He never got fat. He wound up with a used car, a 17-inch screen and arthritis. Tomorrow is a drag, man. Tomorrow is a king-sized bust. They cry: put down pot, don't think a lot. For what time, how much and what to do with it. Sleep man, and you might wake up digging the whole human race. Giving itself three days to get out. Tomorrow is a drag, Pops. The future is a flake. I had a canary who couldn't sing. I had a cat that let me share my pad with her. I bought a dog that killed the cat that ate the canary. What is truth? I had an uncle with an Ivy League heart. He had life with a bell from the back. He had a button-down brain. Wind up a bell from the mouth and a buttoned-down lip. He coughed blood on this earth. Now there is a race for space. We can cough blood on the moon soon. Tomorrow is dragsville, cats. Tomorrow is a king-sized drag. Tool a fast short. Swing with a gassy chick. Turn on to a thousand joys. Smile on what happened or check what is going to happen. You will miss what is happening. Turn your eyes inside and dig the vacuum. Tomorrow drags .. Ready for the race? The Wheelers & Dealers are ready to race you now? As long as you have got enough money to make it worthwhile. These rangers have some cool rods, man. Is it a bet? I'll let you know. - Not me you won't. You'll talk to my secretary here. He handles all my business. What do you boys want? I'll have a cup of coffee and .. Give the man here what he wants. Give me what I want. Ginger ale. Coming up. Miss America. Forget the chicks, man. We've got more important .. What's up? The fuzz just came in. Don't you feel the heat? - Yeah. They are checking to see that nobody is spiking the drinks using other stuff. Man, I can spot them blindfolded. Most of the time I can smell them. Those fuzz, man. Listen. Did you sound out the boys? I already told them you were grazing for grass. Crazy, man. I got a message for you Joan, but .. It's private and personal and kinda fits in with the beat. La cucaracha, la cucaracha. Marijuana puff along. Relax chick. I'm with you. You with it, Daddio? I'm thinking of taking a lease. We'll live it up, you and me. What gives, Doris? Not so good. What's the matter? - I'm, burning up. You just had the shivers a few minutes ago. I'll go make you a cold malt. I'll help you. Come, Doris. You've not been swimming for weeks. Come on, get with it. You said you were steaming hot. Maybe I should cool you off a little bit? Come on, give the kid a break. Let's go in the pool. Thanks. - You are welcome. She. Needs something else other than a malt. You know a lot. I know enough. - Like what? Like, do you have any weed to torch up on? Petey said you were good people. I know what is happening. I am dying to blast but I am clean. How about it, Tony? Are you holding? Sorry, doll, I am trying to make a connection myself. You see, I've got to go but .. No connection. Where are your folks? They are at some luncheon for Doris's father. He just got back from Paris. It's some layout you got here. Someday I will hock the whole place to pay off my debts. Just to get myself some reefers. I told you I've got the gold. Now if you will just tell me who the right guy is. Come on, give me a chance to score. Come here. Check the guy on the diving board. He is a regular comedian. What's his name? - Jukey Judlow. What are the details on him? He is a hard nose. He wouldn't lend me any money when I begged for it. Just because I was a little short. Come on, in the pool. Into the pool you go. Throw her in. One. Two. Three! Why don't you introduce me to this character? I will .. see that you don't have to hock anything. I didn't know you were a weed-head, Tony. All my friends are. If you song me. I want to song you plenty. We are good henchmen, you and me. Get out of here. Shut that door. You'd better get a coat or something to cover up these arms. See she gets home. Well, what are you waiting for? I thought she was just a weed-head like me. She was. She graduated. Don't look so surprised. You want me to spell it out? If you flake around with weed you end up on the hard stuff. Go on. Get the coat will you. What's the idea? You home? - I don't dig you. Well, I'm looking to graze on some grass. You're way out, man. I don't sound you. Now Joan told me that you could straighten me out. See, I want to score like the yanks. Joan told you? - Uhuh. Yeah. She said you and Mary Jane were going steady. What do you mean, you're going steady with another chick? I'm your girl. Yeah. Go and .. go and play in traffic. Man, you shouldn't treat Joan so rough. In her condition she's not a good advert for someone who is pushing the stuff. I'm all tears. She don't beg, she don't get dust. What about Mary Jane? - Oh. I'd like five pounds. Five pounds, man? I don't carry nothing like that. Just a stick or two. You know what I mean. It picks up a couple of the heads at school. I'm no big operator. Joan said you were. Joan has got me figured wrong. Well, I thought I'd score a can, but .. I'll take a stick or two if that's all you got. That's pretty wild. A magnetic box, huh? - Uhuh. A buck a stick. Hey .. when do I meet the ace man? I'm tired of fooling around with this penny alley stuff. The ace man will have a can for you at the race. Tomorrow night. At the old airport. A good deal. You want to see me? Ah Tony. Yes. Would you sit down please. There. I've been thinking about you, Tony. - Well, that sounds romantic. I've been trying to figure you out. Don't knock yourself out. Like the book says, I am a bad customer. So just mark me lousy. Well, you weren't a good student at North High. You certainly haven't tried to learn anything here. What do you want, blood? I want to help you. If I knew you better, I think I could .. - Now that can be arranged. Any night this week. I usually see my students at tea time. You know my address. I will expect you at six o'clock? Crazy. For a cup of tea. Well, I can't tonight. I am .. I am busy, but maybe some other night. Alright. We'll try again sometime. But I could make it maybe about, say like .. Midnight? Forget it. You. You'd better get back to your class. Chicken. I remember when I was a teenager just before prohibition was repealed. We used to sneak a drink or two from a hip flask. My mother and father thought it was the end of the world. So what happened? Absolutely nothing. I settled down happily with your mother. And a pretty successful business if I do say so myself. So, what is all this shouting about? Well dear, perhaps they had some reason for wanting the parents to meet. This police commissioner Walter Burroughs doesn't fool me. He is making political hay. Impressing the voters with another sensational scandal. Only this time he has added something new. Narcotics. Now that I don't like. It's going a little too far. Tony. What do you know about narcotics? Oh, nothing, sir. I've read a little bit about it, but .. And you, baby? Why dad, I haven't even read about it. You see what I mean? The effect of the commissioner's plan will make the kids ask questions. And god forbid they even use narcotics because he's created an interest in it. Well, I can't make the police commissioner's meeting. I have to be at the Better Music Society. We have to be going. Goodnight. Nice meeting you. - Goodnight. And children, behave. Of course, mother. Mother, you don't have to worry about those kids. The only problem children I know are the ones that have problem parents. That leaves us out. Cheers, darling. You sure you don't want to turn on? No. With me it's strictly business. You know, I knew a boy once who gave himself a little fix. And he dropped dead. Just like that. Man, you won't ever catch me fooling around with that hard stuff. One look at Doris and I am convinced to stay with reefers. Well, just take it easy will you. You'll stink up the upholstery. We got together eighty bucks to say our car will beat yours. Covered, man. Hey, that's a hundred-dollar bill. Don't worry. I'm just letting you hold it. I got a better idea. Why don't we join forces? Sorry. I planned it my way. About time you got here. We have a jet change in the jugs. Take a look at this swag man. Hey Tony, you going to drive with this hearse? Put your money where your mouth is. - You tell 'em, Joan. Hey Petey, take care of the car, will you. I got business. Man, are you going to drive this bomb? - Yes. Hurry up with this thing. Jukey set me up for something but I am still looking. Yeah? Well, you can stop looking. As of now. Don't tell me you are my connection? I'm holding, man. You got any complaints? Okay. Let's play follow-the-leader, huh? Hey Petey, don't take all night with this thing, man. Oh, are you going to race daddy's car? Whee. Why don't you make like bubble-gum and blow, flat-top. Oh, wow. Hey man, what you got here? A real live motor? Well. The great Tony Baker. With egg on his face. Let's stick to business. How many joints you got to sell? A hundred. Only a hundred? - Yeah. And it will cost you a hundred. Wait a minute, now. Now that's a retail price. How do I make a profit? I just wanted to see how hip you were. I'm selling at seventy-five cents apiece. I always paid only sixty. Yeah, well the price went up last night. You see, the heat is on now. I know I don't have to tell you what the rap is for pushing stuff in this state. Five years to life. I know. I am all in tears. Look. Why not make it sixty-five and I'll buy all the caps you got too. Caps? Come down now, boy. I am not pushing hard stuff. Alrighty. I'll just take my business someplace else then. You had better buy your stuff from me, friend. Mister A don't like to be bugged. Now who sets it at seventy-five? You or Mister A? I'm just a travelling salesman. I pick up, make deliveries and collect my ten percent. Now do you want it or do you want it? - Okay. Okay, I got no yen to bug Mister A. I guess that what is good enough for him is good enough for me. Crazy. You sure got the bread, brother. There is a lot more too. If you will just help me get some .. Some H, some coke and some goof-balls. It's like I told you, friend. I just work here. Why don't you spread the word around that I need a supplier. Why don't you advertise in the newspaper? Oh, now that is really funny. - Yeah? Yeah. - I thought you'd like that. What's the matter with this thing? What you think is the matter? It won't start. Come on, guys. Push, will you. One, two three. Tony. Come on. You are holding up the action. I got to check the wheels first. - Okay, man. Okay doll. Out. Do you think I'm chicken like the others? Let's roll. Anything you say. Faster, Tony! Faster. Come on. Let's go! Now, Tony. Now! Oh Tony, this is crazy. Let's make it exciting, honey. Come on, we'll show 'em. Get your foot off of there. Step on it, Tony! Who is driving a hearse now? Tony, there's the fuzz. Let's get out of here. The fuzz. The fuzz! Alright. Stay where you are. This is nice. Come on. Get out. Come on, get in there. Suppose you quit shoving. - Suppose you keep your mouth shut. Hey Wyatt Earp, why don't you shoot it out with me? Hey, the broads! Look guys. Say nothing. Don't even give the fuzz the right time of day. Dig it, man. Dig it. What you trying to do to me? - To you? - Yes. I'm doing nothing to you, Mr Staples. It's just .. Don't apologise. The damage is done. I'll sue for false arrest. I'll have you thrown off the force. Daddy. - Take it easy, darling. Take it easy. You 2-bit heroes. Making life miserable for innocent children. Why don't you go out and hunt real criminals? We got a tip on this drag race. But when we found the marijuana .. Well sir, that is a very serious charge. I don't believe the kids have touched the stuff. File suit against the Commissioner first thing in the morning. Mr Staples, let's get out of here. Don't cry, darling. It will be alright. You were figuring on clobbering him. It would be the waste of a good punch. You see, Staples is no exception. The other parents will soon be here jumping all over us. Not my child? Oh no, it's a horrible mistake. They won't believe the truth because they don't want to. Until it is too late. And then they will call us bums because we didn't warn them in time. Take care of this, will you. Now, what is the score? How come I am your client? First, you should know the name is William Remington Kane. Kane? - Correct. I remember reading about you. Don't read so much. Wend your way home with whatever rattrap you call your own. How are you going to get the judge to turn me loose? I'll try to convince him it's weak case against you. That you come from a broken home and all that a sort of claptrap. I guess I got to thank Mr Staples for having such a good lawyer? Mr Staples? Dear me, no. I am merely acting under instructions of .. Of an associate. Now. Goodnight. Don't play games with me, Kane. I like your tailor but .. I still got to know who my fairy godmother is. Don't kid me, buster. Surely you must know I work for Mister A. J.I. I want to see Mister A. You want to climb up awful fast, don't you sonny-boy. Look man, I don't want to cut in on your list. I'm not interested in making just a buck or a half-deal. I want the hard stuff. If you help me get it I'll cut you in for half. Man, look. I dig you see, but .. Man, you sure told off the fuzz in the pokey. Crazy. You got some new admirers. Can I help it if I am charming? You know, you could have been hurt last night .. or killed. Look, I can get killed crossing the street. Now, excuse me will you. I have got to go and see a man. Tony .. just a minute. Why, you are not stupid. There is no point in risking your life just to be fawned on by a few teenagers. I'm not risking anything. I can drive. If you want I will give you a demonstration. How well can you drive when you're hopped up with marijuana? Now wait a minute. It says someplace that a man is innocent until he's proven guilty. Marijuana was found near your car. Look, the cops plant that stuff all the time just to make arrests. Alright. I've tried to help you. I guess the only person that can help you is yourself. Wait a minute. I will make a deal with you. Why don't I come to your house and we'll talk the whole thing over? I'll even drink your tea. No. I have suddenly run out of tea. [ Doorbell ] I left it open for you. In a moment, honey. Oh. Are you Mrs Dulaine? - Yes. Are you Tony's aunt? Yeah. Well I am Arlene Williams, his counsellor from school. Oh yes. Won't you come in? - Thank you. The house is in kind-of a mess. Sit down. Now, about Tony. About you first. Tony said he had a good-looking teacher. Now, really. - He was right. Thank you. Of course, every student feels that way about their teacher. Unless of course she has two heads. I'll bet. You know, the school usually arranges these meeting with the parents, but .. Because of the seriousness of the situation the other night. I know all about it. He was in the pokey on a bum rap. Big deal. Mr Robinson tells me we should meet with the parents or the .. Guardians as soon as possible. You mean you want me to squeal on Tony? No sale. Even if I had anything to say I wouldn't. You see, there is this group at school and .. They seemed to have formed some bad habits. Look, Miss Dimpletoes .. If you people at the school think that Vic and me .. Vick is my husband and he is out of town on a job. If you think we are raising a juvenile delinquent, say it. No, Mrs Dulaine, we don't .. - Don't double-talk me. You've got me pegged as a no-good relative. The only reason I came is .. - Come on, honey. Don't draw diagrams with me. I am no idiot child. I just don't believe all that stuff the papers said about .. Wild reefer parties and fates worse than death in the bushes at night. I know Tony, even if he has only been living here a short while. He's almost a grown man who wants to get a bang out of life just like you or me. I think if Tony's interests were channelled that .. There is nothing to channel. He is healthy and normal and .. And full of fun. You know what I mean too. Don't say you never rode a hot-rod or had a late date on the second balcony. Or maybe you haven't. I think I had better go, Mrs Dulaine. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hi, Arlene. - Hello Tony. What is wrong now? I was just paying a little call on your aunt. I hope I haven't inconvenienced Mrs Dulaine. What have you two been doing then, pulling hair? Your teacher and I were fighting over the custody of your body and soul. What? Arlene. Now I understand things better. Cut the yakkety-yak will you. She has no personal interest in me. Oh wake up, sonny-boy. Your teacher has got a yen for you. You're nuts. And don't forget. I really know you are not a baby. Hmm. I have to go change. I .. I don't remember inviting you in here. I won't look. What's cooking? I am going to the drag to hear a new combo. I'd like to hear them too. I'll go with you. Sorry, I got a date with Joan. Forget her. Pay a little attention to me. Later. No. Now. I'm lonely. I found some marijuana cigarettes when I cleaned your room today. I wish you had. We could sell them to the weed-heads at school. Who are you kidding? In that drawer under your handkerchiefs. That's where I found them. Skinny brown cigarettes. Honey. Those are imported short cigarillos. If you don't like it .. I don't like being brushed off all the time. I could forget myself and say the right things to the wrong people. Well, if that's the way the ball bounces. Don't push me. You had better tell the Staples kid to drop dead. Not tonight. See you later. Man, that swings. Hey. Are you torching up? Look, don't be a drag, kitten. We don't want to get caught with a reefer again. I've had enough of the pokey and all of that jazz. I'll get my kicks out of you. Well. Can I have the next waltz? Will you join us for a drink? No thanks. I never touch the stuff. It's bad for us baseball players. Come on, boy. We got five minutes. You mean ..? - Uhuh. The man wants to see you. - Do you have to go, Tony? Yes. It's some Wheeler & Dealer stuff but it will only take about an hour. Just stay here and keep mellow for me, will you, kitten. I've got to get some cigarillos so I'll meet you by the door. What a drag. You bug this joint like a real L7. Got the tools? Up my sleeve. Money? - Uhuh. But I don't know where J.I. is taking me. Do you like this combo? Yeah, it's crazy. Hello nephew of mine. Didn't think I could make it, huh? Later, Gwen. I'll be late. - See, I can get a date if I want. I don't have to come crawling, see. Not good enough for you, huh? You hear that Billy-boy? He says I'm not good enough. He's got a schoolteacher. Come on, Billy-boy. This is an aunt? Boy, she can chaperone our next dance any time. Come on. - Any time. This here is Bix. You two will probably be seeing a lot each other. What are you picking up on, man? Whatever you are putting out. I'm just trying to play it cool. That's the most, man. Always play it cool. Bix likes it cool. 824. Hi, Bix. - Hi. Close that door will you, Bix. Doris don't feel so hot. A tough little broad. She still won't say yes. Mister August. I'd like you to meet Mr Tony Baker here. You have already been apprised. It's my sincere hope you two are going to have a long, profitable friendship. I've tried to tell that chick that no hop-head ever becomes a lady. It just ain't on the cards. You're the new pusher, huh? - Well .. Put that drink down. You know what alcohol does to your system. Well, it's my first one. - Now look. I pay you for a class family. Upper class. Let's keep it that way. Just lay off the booze. Now get out. Alcohol is murdering the system. That Doris sure has something wrong with her system. You know her? Yeah. She is a friend of Joan Staples. Lives right next door. She is sure all strung out with a habit. I told her I'd give her a fix if she'd join some girlfriends of mine. A nice little home up state, but .. She wants to be a lady. She is kicking it bad. And she is cracking up. It looks like she is ready to give. J.I. tells me you are real good people. You've been throwing your gold around like you made it yourself. I take a little, leave a little. You hit Santa Bella like a tornado. A big noise. But, what else? I've got four big ones and I'm looking for junk. Now they tell me that you can handle it. If not .. I will connect down south. Easy, boy. Just because you're straight with the low-balls don't mean you're good people. Mister A always likes to make sure. We had a Federal roper try to ace himself in two years ago. When we got through with him .. He was too wet to plow. I checked on you personally. You are good people. Glad to know you, Baker-boy. - Same here. Just a little bit surprised to hear that you got busted for using H. Oh that. Well, I was just joy-popping. I'm not a habit man. Oh. Bix, give everybody a pop and .. See if the lady in the next room wants a fix. That's if she's ready to cooperate. Be my guest, Baker-boy. Crazy-looking tools. Nothing but the best. After you, Baker-boy. I forgot my cap. - I told you to beat it. Okay, okay. I'm going. Have a ball now, hear. Man, that's a good needle. What about your pop? I just gave you a final exam. You passed. Easy, Mister A. I never took a fix and I never will. I just wholesale to hop-head pushers. If I ever took a shot and the big boys heard about I'd be out of business. Did you ever know a hype you could trust? No. The kids want it fine. If they don't we get the other kids to pass the word around they're chicken. The more kids that get hooked, the better for business. But no junkie young or old, will ever get the big-time rackets. How come you let me have a shot? Who said you were big time? You are just a big customer. Nothing more. If you try to rat on me it is just junkie's word against mine. And me? I'm a solid citizen. I am clean. No marks. You are going to wind up like that chick in the other room. Okay. What do you want to buy and how much? Half a kilo. It will cost you a lot of bread. I'm ready. Well, pay Bix and we'll tell you when to pick it up. No. No. First .. First, I see the stuff. Then you get the bread. Smart boy. It's going to cost you four big ones though. The high cost of living. You got his phone number? We'll call you in about an hour and tell you where to pick up the stash. Later, man. I'll drop you off at your wheels. This way, sonny-boy. Hi. - Hello, Mike. As soon as Quinn called I alerted everyone. We've got Mister A's place staked out by most of our men. Quinn is staying on at the drag. Watch yourself. This is a bad bunch. Do you still want me to tape the buy? Yeah, if you can. How is Gwen behaving? That "aunt" bit is getting pretty rough. Well. Good luck, Mike. Thank you, sir. You know, after this I will have to take another training course .. To learn how to behave like a human being again. See you. Crazy Mister A. "I never took a fix and I never will." "I wholesale to hop-head pushers." What won't they think of next? No bedroom should be without one. What are you doing here? I got tired waiting all by my lonesome. Tony. Come here, Tony. Joan, I didn't tell you you could come here. I've been hung up like a junior. Look, what if my aunt comes home? Who is this Mister A? Why do you have to record it? Don't you people trust anybody? Jukey wouldn't trust me for five stinking dollars. You don't trust the man that sells to you. Who is this Mister A? Lay off it. Lay off it, doll. Be a big girl and stop goofing off. Tony, I must be going deaf. I thought I heard Tony Baker say for me to stop blasting. No more jokes. Give me a joint. Pretty please. Something wrong, Daddio? - Uhuh. Yeah, now look. I'm sorry but I've got business, honey. Not now. I know it's a drag but I have got to cut out. Aren't we even going to listen to that cute little tape recorder? That's just stuff I recorded in Chicago. Well, let's call J.I. and the other cats. I'd like them all to listen to that recorded jive. We'll just have a ball. Sure. Sure. Look. I dig you. You stay here. You stay put right here and I will go and make a couple of calls. I'll make a couple of calls. And we'll have ourselves a real session. Don't be too long. - I won't. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yeah, this is Baker. Hiya, Bix. Yeah? In half an hour? Good deal. I will be there. Hello? Hi. This is Tony Baker. Look, I need your help. What is this, a joke? No, no. This isn't a gag. You have just got to believe me. I can't explain now. Why should I believe you? It is about Joan Staples. Can you come over here right away? Now Tony, just a minute. Let me think. Look, the longer you think about it the rougher it will be all round. If you have ever believed in me before now is the time to do it. Okay. I'll leave the front door open. Now, you've got to come over as fast you can and try and keep Joan here. I know I can trust you. You have got to trust me. Now wait a minute, Tony. Look, it's late. I am in bed. Look, if you don't believe me call Commissioner Burroughs. Tony, I can't believe you. Now please help me. I haven't got time to talk any longer. Goodbye. Just in time Tony-boy to have a party with my old friend. No, I'm in a rush. - What's the matter? My old friend here. My old friend. What's your name, old friend? Bill O'Flair. You know what I think? I think I don't like this guy. - What's the matter? Is my old friend Billy-boy not good enough? Now look, sober up will you. This is important. Joan Staples is in my bedroom. Look, you have got to keep her there. This is important to Burroughs. Joan Staples .. in your room? Now that is an insult. Hey. Did you insult that little lady, huh? I decided to pick you up, Baker. We might not be able to find our new drop. Tony. I don't like a guy who can't hold his liquor. Don't give me that goody, goody stuff. I'm going to have a good time when the time is right and the time is right now. Joan dear, listen. You've got to control yourself. Tony is a pusher. If I find a reefer you will not stop me from blasting. I can try. - You had better not. Well now. What's this, a class reunion? What are you two doing here? Go on, get out. Both of you. I mean, you don't give the orders here. After all we are not in the school room. Please J.I. give me a joint. I've just got to have a blast. I asked you before, baby. What you doing here? - Leave that girl alone. Sorry, Miss Williams. You don't want to get hurt. I said leave her alone! - After she tells us a couple of things. No! Not you, not Jukey. Not even Mister A. What's that you said, kitten? You mean about .. Mister A? Yeah, I mean about Mister A. What do you know about him? - You will not get away with this. Shut up. Well I ask you, what do you know about him? I am thin, J.I. Real thin. Buy me a stick from Jukey and maybe I'll tell you. One stick. Joan. Joan, please don't. Now who told you about Mister A? Tony is a very close friend of Mister A, even though he doesn't trust him. Yeah? What does that mean in American? I mean if you trust someone, do you always take along a small tape recorder? To check the deal that you make? You know something, Joanie? I don't believe you. What are you doing? No! Okay, the party is over. I want my father. Please god, where is my father? I don't want them to hit me anymore. Everything will be alright now. Hey, Tony. We can use you on the team if it doesn't sound too square for you. Try me a little later will you, Steve. I might be ready for you. Are you looking for a table? Sorry. But we changed the reservations. Come on. Get lost. Where is the bread? Where is the stuff? - It's here. Pay the man. Four Gs? For half a kilo. Over Bix's right shoulder there is loose brick. Which one? You .. sure play it careful. Baker-boy. You just got yourself the best heroin on the market. I know. That's why I came to you. Yep? Let's have that again. Yeah, I'm telling you. Thanks man. I got you. Did you get him in time? You sure? Alright, kid. Roll up those sleeves. Roll 'em. Help him, Bix. Okay. Bix. Tell the band to play a loud number. Now why don't we make a deal? 0ne wrong move and I won't wait for the loud music. Don't move. Bentley. Walter Burroughs said if I needed any help I could depend on you. I am Quinn from the police department. Sure. What is the deal? Get your boys together and we will .. Look, the police know I am here. So, it would mean a murder rap for you. Selling means life. What is the difference? Hold it! Hit the lights. "You have just seen an authentic disclosure of conditions."
