Thanks a lot. - No problem. Get your ass out of here, lady! You bull... imbecile! - Oh! - And take these with you! Damn it! You son of a bitch! I hope you run into a truck! What's more, you got lousy taste in music! - Are you gonna be all right? - What do you want? I saw you get thrown out of that Van. You landed kind of hard. - Sure you're okay? - Rotate out of here, Jack. Eh, you say so. - Hey, you, Ace. - The name's Harkin. - Excuse me, Harkin. Where you headed? - West. - How 'bout you? - San Francisco. - Want a ride? - Sure. Okay. - Here. - I can handle it. You ain't some kind of a weirdo, are you? I don't think so. - What's your name? - Sunny. How come that guy threw you out of there like that? - What do you think? - I don't know. That's why I asked. I ain't going down on a guy at 65 miles an hour just for a crummy ride. Got something besides this? I'm tired of this. - What, you don't like country? - Why don't you try something different? - Okay? - Yeah, just pop it in. Now this I can handle. So why you got four pairs of skis back there? Skiing the World Championship's Freestyle at Squaw Valley. I got, uh, one for Bumps, one for Aerials. Little short ones there are for Ballet, and those ones are for just plain speed. Speed? I could use some of that. - You got a girlfriend, Ace? - I used to, but I spent all my time skiing. She got tired of being number two. - Hey, how old are you? - 18 in April. - Ran away from home, right? - Wrong. You gotta have a home to run away from. Sunny. Sunny... I'm getting a room for the night. Hey, buddy, you figure you can get in my pants this way. I ain't figuring nothing. You want to spend the night out here in the truck? Huh? I mean, it's okay by me. Hey, Harkin, got something I can wear to bed? My mother forgot to pack my pajamas. - Thank you. - You know there's only one bed in here. So? Pick a side. And stay there. So how come you didn't try nothing last night? I was tired. You didn't exactly invite me, anyway. Are you for real? Are you a virgin? Are you? Well, you had your chance, fella. I ain't half bad, you know. So what happens in Squaw Valley besides skiing? Beats me. I've never been there. You see, I don't really have to be in San Francisco for a while and I... well, maybe do you just think I can... - Wanna tag along? - Well, yeah. - Why not? - Okay, but no funny stuff. I don't put out for everyone I pick up. Hello? Anybody home? Anybody home?! Anybody home? Damn it. Someone's at the front desk. I'll be right back. - Checking in? - Yeah. Banks. Harkin. Freestyler? Mm, yeah. It's the last room we had. I was getting worried about you. I'll bet. Welcome to squaw. And call me if you need anything. Yeah, could you wash the truck for us? Come on, Harkin. Oh, yeah. Wow! Get a load of this! I can't believe it. This looks like a cathouse. Whoa! This is great! And you were gonna stay here alone? It's the only place I could get. Hey, Harkin, check this out. - How does it work? - I don't know. I think it's got some jets or something that forces the water up. A friend of mine stayed in a place like this once, but it was only for an hour. Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, don't stop. - Oh, that feels good. - I want more. - Do it! - You like that, huh? Yes, I do! Oh, I want more! Touch me! Geez. What do you say we get something to eat? Wanna try these on? - Don't you like the way I dress? - I thought you might look nice in them. - Oh, yeah. - Right there. - Am I gonna have to wash dishes, H? - Mm-mm. It's my treat. Well, how can you afford all of this... The room, the food, this sweater. Well, my ma knit the sweater and been working all summer for the money to make this trip. Milked 40 head of cattle twice a day. Whoa. Get a load of him. Oh, my god. You know him? That's Rudolph Garmischt. Won the gold medal in lake placid 1980, and he's the World Freestyle Champ last two years running. Damn sexy, too. He's the best. World's greatest skier. Mr. Garmischt? Ja? I think you're the greatest. Hey, Adolf! Somebody's talking to you. In Europe, ja? There the women are beautiful... But also intelligent. Rotate on this, you Nazi bastard! Hey. Hi. Nice coat, uh... rat? You shouldn't have done that. That was Rudolph Garmischt. He's a jerk. Always has been. Greetings. Dan O'Callahan. I've seen you in all the ski magazines. Dan here used to be one of the best. Still am. - What's your name? - I'm Harkin Banks. This is sunny. I came here to compete. Uh, if I qualify. You gotta be pretty good to make it on this circuit, kid. - You here to qualify, too? - I ain't into skiing. Well, that's no problem. Plenty of things to do here. So, you met Rudi, huh? Well, he might be a great skier, but he's a world class asshole. Mm. Well, see you on the mountain, huh, kid? - Yeah, I'll be there. - Pleasure. That guy wants to get into my pants. - What? - He's got another thing coming if he thinks he's gonna make it with me. I ain't into older men, you know? - Watch out, watch out. - No! Hey, watch it, buddy! You jerk! Come on, Ace. - I'll buy you a drink. - You got it. All right! Nice hand for the band! Okay, everybody sit down because you know what time it is... Wet t-shirt contest time! I'm Lester the molester and I run the baddest, meanest wet t-shirt contest there is. But what do you need to have a wet t-shirt contest? Yeah, girls! Send the girls up here! All right, we need more girls than this, don't we? Yes, we do! But in order to find girls, I gotta get out my girl finder! Oh, let's look for the girls. Where are you, girls? - Come on, get up here. - Go for it! Close this up. Don't want anybody to get hurt. Hold this for me back there, would you, darling? - Boo! - Let's find some more girls. How 'bout this girl over here? How about you, honey, you wanna get up here? Nah, she said... Hey, guys, let's get that girl up here. Oh, she's covering up. Let's go into the back here. How about that girl? Guys, get her up here. Come on! Bring her up here! Let's get her up here! - I got 50 bucks on you. Sure winner. - No way! - Come on, baby. - 50 bucks? Oh, my lord. How do you do, darling? I'm new in town. I don't know how to get to your house. How 'bout you, honey? You look like you're in the mood for the contest. - No... - Guys are all pointing you out. - I say, what do you say? - All right, all right. Come on up here. Yeah, okay, come on. We need some more girls. How 'bout this girl back here? Come on up here. Yeah, get her up here. How about a volunteer? Ah! Put me down! Come on, put me down! Put me down! How 'bout this for a volunteer? All right! Okay! Guys, don't you wish you had the seltzer bottle in your hand so you could help? But this is my contest so I'm the one that gets to do it. Oh, this is great fun. It's water time. Give me a volunteer. Time to splash the water. Take it off! Take it off! Come on!

I was up all night doing a crossword puzzle. You want a sip? No. A strike. Hey, listen, kid. I saw your qualifying run this morning. You're not bad. Thanks. When are you running? Oh, well, us vets did yesterday. They don't post the results until tonight, so we're just gonna go out and boogie. You know, just clean out the system. Hey... well, Harkin Banks, I want you to meet the rat pack. - This is Squirrel Murphy. - Hey. Yeah, best run of the morning, man. Were you on shrooms or what? Hey, he's a little crazier than he looks. Come on. Oh, and that's Kendo. - He's got a way with words, huh? - Yeah. We call him kamikaze. When you see him ski, you'll know why. Oh, and that's Fergy, the motor mouth. Shut up. And then banana pants. You can call her Michelle. She's taken. - I am? - Cute, huh? Oh, and Slasher. Slasher. Slasher. Say hi to Harkin Banks. - Hey, Harkin. - Hey. Good, huh? Well, Harkin here is gonna put the fear of god into Rudi Kazooti Garmischt. He asked you if you want to ski with us this afternoon. - All right. - We're gonna hit some radical terrain. Avalanche city. Out of bounds. - Squirrel mountain. - Hey, sounds great. Well, then let's climb aboard in an orderly fashion. Spread out. Whoo! Hey. Hey, how you doing, Sylvia? I'll be doing better once you introduce me to your friend. I saw him qualify in red dog. He's real good. You guys better watch out. - Are you gonna introduce me or not? - Well, of course. Hey, hark, come here. Harkin Banks, I'd like you to meet Sylvia. - New on the circuit? - Yeah. We're gonna go do broken arrow. You want to ski with us? I gotta get the house ready for the big party tonight. Oh, well, we'll see you tonight. Can I bring you anything? Bring him. I might make him the guest of honor. Well, you know, he's got a friend. So bring his friend. Okay. Can I bring you anything else? Just you, Daniel. Just you. She always makes it to the qualifying rounds. That way, she can check out the new talent. She is beautiful. You got a good eye, kid. - Watch out! Watch out! - Hey! Rudi, you're a goddamn lowlife cretinous slug! You people, stay out of our way. You may ski on zat side or on zat side. But stay out of zee middle here. Hey, Rudi, you can kiss my ass. Not on zis side, not on zat side, but right in zee middle. Come, Heinz. We finish this later. - What is it with that guy? - Sylvia used to be Rudi's girlfriend till someone long dicked her in Europe. Figures it was me. - Couldn't blame a guy, though, could you? - Uh-uh. - Sylvia's sure got what it takes. - Yeah, that's why she's got the Rudettes drooling all over her. - Rudettes? - Rudi's gang. They're so far up his ass, they don't know where he leaves off and they begin. Hey, what do you say we tear up this mountain? - Okay, let's hit it! - Whoo-hoo! All right, let's go!

Funniest thing you ever saw was Squirrel... Hey, you guys talking about me again? Squirrel skiing with his pants split up the middle. Hey, it was too hot to wear underwear. Oh, so he skis down right in front of the TV cameras, right? He passes and he bows to the judge, he flashes the biggest moon you've ever seen in your life. It must have been a hell of a jump, Squirrel, to rip your pants off. Hey, Kendo's right. I cranked off a triple... I flew 100 yards. Fuckin'-a, man, that jump was totally awesome. Guys, I'd like to propose a little toast. To Squirrel Murphy. He's been on the world freestyle circuit for four years. He's made $392, been laid twice. Once every other year. Not bad, Squirrel. And I would like to toast Snake Legs Banks the Bonners Ferry Flash, the newest member of the rat pack. Right here! There it is. - Do you see mine, Dan? - Yeah, you're on it. - What about me, Dan? - Slasher, Kendo. Squirrel. All right! Hey, what about Fergy and Dogger? - That's it. - Oh, what the hell? - Fader, come back here. God damn it. - Hey, Fergy. Four years in the circuit and he gets cut. Can you believe it? Dogger and Fergy skied better than most of the Europeans on the tour. - That doesn't seem fair. - It isn't. - Fader... - Dan, I know what you're gonna say, but we're running a show. Well, how come you cut Fergy and dogger? - They just didn't make it. - Didn't make it? They skied better than half the Europeans. - You call yourselves promoters? - It's a business. Accommodations have to be made, O'Callahan. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You know, I remember when this used to be a sport. We've got 14 European sponsors paying for TV coverage for one named skier. Lose that name, and the circuit folds. Right now we're saddled with European sponsors. That means certain Europeans qualify. And certain Americans don't qualify? Hey, guys, we haven't had an American winner in over five years. Now, look, Dan, there hasn't been an American freestyler who could beat Garmischt in five years. We landed the meet here because of him. Oh, I see. Huh. So, it's a business, is that it, fellas? O'Callahan... It's show business. Yeah? Well, why don't you explain that to those kids that have travelled over 1,000 miles to get here, huh? What are you getting so bent out of shape for, O'Callahan? You made it. You've been over the hill for five years. All right, Dan. - I don't like that guy. - Come on. I'll buy you a beer. - We'll talk about it, hmm? - Fader, come on, huh? We go back a long way. You're an old free-dogger yourself, huh? Dan, I'm between a rock and a hard place. That's bullshit. Bullshit. - What was that? - A burst of courage. - What's that mean? - It's a prescription for crowd scenes. You don't need that. Look, Harkin, it's my business what I swallow, okay? What was it? What difference does it make? - Well, I don't like it. - Well, tough. What do you think, we spend one night together and you own me? ♪ Do you love me? ♪ Good evening, Harkin. So glad you could make it. - Your friend? - Yeah. Um, Sylvia, this is sunny. Sunny, Sylvia. You were terrific today, Harkin. I haven't seen a skier like you in years. - And I've seen them all. - I'll bet you have. Thanks. - Are you a skier? - No. - Oh, just a spectator, then? - Right. - Except I haven't found the mountain yet. - Oh. Well, it's the big hill with the snow all over it.

I threw the little fish back when I finished with her. Rudi, you hit a new low this time. You're hurting my feelings, my good friend. - Hey, Garn-shit. - Garmischt. Yeah, Garn-shit. Why don't you ask the rookie here about his bubble bath with Silvia last night? - Ho-ho! - That's right, Rudi. You've been back-doored again, but this time, right in the same house. Yeah, you just ain't on Silvia's top 40, shorty. Ja, we will see you show-offs, you comedians tonight, ja? If you're not cowards. And I especially hope that you, little rookie, won't be too shy to join us. I'll be there. Huh. Be where? Rudi challenged us to a broom ball match tonight at the arena. All right.

Where were you last night? You sure ask a lot of questions. Well, I was worried. - I'm sure. - I was. You were with Rudi, weren't you? And what difference would it make? What do you mean "what difference would it make"? And what were you doing in the hot tub with Sylvia? You surprised me, too, H. - She gave me this stuff. - Oh, that's bullshit! - I didn't know what I was doing. - Tell me about it. - Don't forget your shampoo. - It's already packed. Hey...

Take no prisoners. - Squirrel? - All right. Mm, mm, mm. I think we should spot them a couple goals, what do you think, guys? They're not gonna play serious, are they? - No, I don't think so, no. - Good. You guys ready? Yeah! You ready? Okay, play hard, play fair, and keep your sticks down. Busy for dinner? Out of the way! You know something, guys? I'm getting too old for this. - Did you see that Garmischt blindside me? - Yeah. They were vicious, but we tried. Yeah. Hey, we were small, but we were slow. Very funny. Yeah. - Yeah, next time. - Yeah, next... Next time we'll have uniforms. - Yeah! - Hey, you guys wanna go for a nightcap - at the lone star? - Oh, hey, listen, man. We'll join you later.

Thought I could stop and give you a few pointers. Yeah, you got a couple! So why don't you point 'em that way and crawl out of my sight?! Oh, you gotta learn to bend your knees. Get your mama to bend her knees. I don't have time. That way you could suck up the bumps. You do know how to do that, don't you? Here, let me give you a hand. I can see why Harkin likes you. Oh, I get it. Switch-hitter. First Harkin and now me. You really are a sicko, lady. Maybe you and Harkin and... We could all get together later. Harkin can do whatever the hell he pleases. All I was doing was having a little fun with him. You can have him back. Ooh, if I could only ski, I would take this pole... If you get bored with Harkin, send him over later on. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. Oh, so do I, bitch! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Mogul Competition. The second event of this Championship Weekend. After the Ballet Competition, Rudolph Garmischt of Austria is in first place. Followed by Werner Bleiner of West Germany in second. Heinz Hartmann of Austria in third. Kendo Yamamoto of Japan in fourth position. And newcomer Harkin Banks of the United States in fifth place. Right behind Banks in sixth is Dan O'Callahan of the U.S. I'm after Rudi. The luck of the draw. It's a tough act to follow, but if you ski like you did when you qualified, you could be the kid we're looking for. And now the current World Champion, Rudi Garmischt to the starting gate. Garmischt, any time you're ready, eh? Just a moment. A spectacular run by Rudi Garmischt! In a moment, the judges' score... The one thing about Rudi, he sure can ski. 9.8, 9.7, 9.9, 10. A total of 49.1! He might of been great once. He wasn't that good today. Kid, let me tell you something. He didn't win the world cup three years in a row because he's bad. Next up is Harkin Banks, number 149. Go get 'em, kid.
