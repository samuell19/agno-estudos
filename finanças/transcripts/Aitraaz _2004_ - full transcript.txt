Cuco... cuco? Yiaaaaa! Hola, paquito! Looking for me? Cuco, you should be at the circus "cuco you should be at the circus!" Don't you ever just want to have fun, paquito? Uh uh sure you do, watch this! Huh? Oh no we're late again! Oh, man! Gotta hurry or I'll miss it! The last one home is a rotten egg! ♪♪ Uh oh! I hope I'm not going to be late. I hope I'm not late... You mean late for work, right? Nah, not that? Your dad needs you, you have to be responsible. Ok paquito, I'm going to say this only once, so you have to listen very carefully alright? Uaaaaagh! I know that I'm meant to do something else! All my life, I've heard something inside me calling for me to go out there and live an adventure! Like on TV! ¡Ay! You know exactly what I mean right? But you're late for your job. I know, I'm late to do my job, but I made on time to watch 'El americano: The TV series'! But, but, but, but the divas need their pink hats, and divino his w... Hold that thought. See ya! Ay, ay, ay... uaaagh! Mmhmm... Hola, cuco! Oh, hi mom. Shouldn't you be at the circus? They don't really need me. They can get their own props. Well, your father needs you. Soon you will be ready to be part of the show... And I know you'll do great. But mom, I don't wanna do old stuff. I wanna do something different! Oh, your time will come, don't worry mijito. You don't know how lucky you are for being part of the generations circus. It's a dream-- and you get to live it! Please don't disappoint your father. Ándale, let's go! In a minute, I... I just need to... change my underwear! Yeah, that's it! Ay ay, vamos, vamos... I'm right behind you. Echale primo! Go! Go! Go! Yeah! Cape! Oh yeah! Holy guacamole! Look out-- he's right behind you! Cuco! Dad, I... I was just going to... How many times do I have to tell you: This cape is not a plaything! It is a symbol for all of us at the circus. It is an honor to wear it. And instead of trying to understand, prepare yourself to follow our rules and traditions, you are late! And you waste your time, watching this... ay. Dad, traditions need to change. The circus needs to be more spectacular... Like El americano! What a waste! But dad, our circus is so boring! Everyone's seen the same already! If I did some super-flips and you could-- enough! You think circus stars hatch overnight? If you want to be a star you first need to learn respect! Until then, you will continue to assist every one with the props in the circus! The divas need their pink hats. C'mon, vamonos! [Music] [Singing in Spanish] Garza Garcia, come on! We need to practice! Uh? Yes divino, yes, here it goes, here it goes? Garza! You dork stork! Sorry mighty divino... Hey! I am a stork, not a dork hijole, come on chu! Pronto pues... Oh! Tacos, torta, abracad... Abracadabra! I, I, I did it? -Where did he go? -Where did he go? I'm up here you cucu cucu hey you founded the divas pink hats bravo, bravo El gran divino no, no, no esperate... Why? What have I done to deserve this? [Laughs] You guys should put this comedy in the act! I've heard this song a thousand times and still love it! Man, this is older than old school, ancient history! Aah, my son... you're just watching and hearing... Not looking and listening. You must feel the excitement, the circus, the props, the show, the colors, some little bird will be here laughing, entire families cheering. It is our life, it is our... Circo de las generaciones! [Music] Buenas noches, my fine feathered friends! Welcome to you all! Our next act is a personal favorite of mine and I must say, my wife, Lori, makes a most lovely assistant! Put your wings together for our very own mystic-- El gran divino! Since the beginning of time, the mistic owls has been the greatests magicians of all, making possible the impossible. Behold, behold and tonight we will witness something spectacular and exciting that will leave you with your beaks wide open the spirit of chicken fajitas, chupacabra, Chimichanga, chalupa... cha! I said... aaaaahh [music] What's going on? Wow ha ha [crowd cheering] For those of you who don't know, I am... Martin the king... Fisher! Martin! Where is Lori? Gayo, my old friend, acaso no fui claro? I will take over your petty little circus with my electrifying circo extremo! I am here to challenge you for the cape! You should give it to me now, or shall I take what is mine by force? It will take more than flash and threats to take over the honorable tradition. As bearer of the cape, it is I who sets the time for a new challenge! Fair enough. A full moon is coming... I will meet you again. Fate will determine who has the right to wear the cape! Never tempt fate, old friend. As the full moon shines for all to see, the cape shall be mine! Gayo, gayo... Lori wha... what happened? Trouble with a capital m. Oh, gayo, what are we to do? If Martin wins the cape challenge we are all certainly done for. No more circo for you... Or you... Or for anybody. Which might not be a bad thing. Hold on, friends, hold on! As you may know, Martin and I go back many years. He holds a grudge and wants the cape, but with it goes the generations circus as we know it. Our feud started in this very tree. A long, long time ago... Generations of birds have come to witness the passing of the cape. In a tradition that continues to this day. don quetzal was the first of many quetzals that followed, but their numbers dwindled. Soon it came time to pass the cape to a new family of birds. Martin and I were both considered to be new the bearer of the cape. Martin had flash, no doubt. He had the most outrageous act anyone had ever seen! My act was daring, yet simple. But that night beneath the full moon the cape was passed... to me. Martin was crushed, his loss unbearable. Vowing revenge, the kingfisher flew away. Martin was never seen again... Until... right now. I don't get it... If that guy was so hot, why didn't he win the cape? don quetzal awarded tradition and respect. ...and the bird with the biggest heart. Ok, but... what are we going to do now? Let's walk... just you and me. What is it dad? Everyone starts at the bottom, cuco, that's how we learn. In time I am sure that you will go to the very top! I know, I know I have to be patient, dad. The generations circus is all about tradition... And that's important, cuco but you know? Sometimes change can be good. What do you mean? I need you for something bigger. Something new for the circus if we want to win Martin's challenge. Oh yeah? You've been talking about a new act. How about you and I try some of those El americano moves? You really mean it? Of course! Awesome! Check out this super-flip! Wow! Whoops! I didn't mean to do that! You teach me your El americano moves I'll teach you some neat old school juggling. Deal! Oh, dad we're gonna have the best new act ever! [Music] Ok! Wow, the tower of challenges looks amazing! This is impressive, challenging for sure you ready, mijo? I was born ready! Good evening and welcome to the new generations circus... Behind this curtain... A story unfolds... The famous street artist on his biggest performance yet, when over the city tonight, he will juggle not 3, but 5 golden eggs at once... Look at him so in control oh no! The evil thieves are here to steal the golden eggs! They try to take the street performer down with giant fire balls! Fire? Wow! They are really bad. Disaster strikes! A lady in trouble! Luckily for her, the street performer can carry her to safety! Cuidado, cuidado but wait! What's this? There's also a baby in danger, the brave citizen must carry him too!! More guns! More fireballs! More danger! And... the baby's grandma is in trouble too!! The abuelita too? Fireballs are menacing the abuelita. But our fearless citizen is an open target. But wait! Could this be? It is! El americano! Yiaa! Yiaaa! Oh no! The lava ball canon! Wow! What is that? This is your finish act bad guys bravo! Bravo pssst, vovo , time to tell the boss wussup!

Shhhhh callate y vamonos Martin, Martin tenemos noticias de último momento, esos pájaros estan planeando algo muy hábil de su parte y creo que debemos hacer algo por... Yaaaah! Stop talking so fast. I can't understand a word you said! The parrots at the circus are preparing a new big act! Dobles trucos! Super saltos bien locos! Toys-a-popping everywhere! It's big, it's new, it's fresh, it's-- it's never... going... To be seen. What do you mean? Oh nada rayito, I have to take care of some things so gayo can suffer like I suffered: Little... humiliation. Time for plan x, stage 1: Sabotage! Plan equis, sabotear... mmm mh mh mh... What is this plan x? Why didn't anyone tell me? Oh, is just me getting my cape back... that's all. Nothing to worry your pretty little head about. My pretty little head can take it, thank you, very much! Ooooooohh... If this has anything to do with anybody getting hurt, I'm out! Ay my lost child, do not fear. This is simply about getting back what is rightfully mine. Remember? Dovo, vovo... Yes boss! Commence plan x. Ha ha ha ha ha... Sabotage! Come on dad, one more pass ready! Ok! Good evening and welcome to the new generations circus... Behind this curtain... A story unfolds... Oh no! Eh? Watch out cuco! Cuco! Cuco cuidado! Ay! Uh? No! Gayo! Cuco! Oh! Papá! Gayo! My good leg.. Papa! Oh, gayo, mi amor. We must take him home right away, carefully, please, carefully! Rápido, rápido vamos. [Cuco] Dad I'm so sorry look vovo , the cape! [Vovo] La capa, lo que tanto quería Martin pues ahí está, la tenemos a nuestro alcance. Martin is going to be so happy! He might even be nice to us now ¿crees que nos vaya a dar una recompensa? Ya ves que es re codo, yo quisiera unas vacaciones en chiconautla, en zacatlan de las manzanas, en cuatzingo bueno pos aunque sea en disneylandia. I want a ranch with horses and cows and chivos and a lot of chicken, oh yes a lot of chicken. Quick, vovo , hide! Rapido rapido escondete que viene algo que gran descuido. It was just a little yellow canary! And it took the cape. What are we going to tell Martin now? Todo fue tu culpa, me distrajiste con todo lo que hablas y dices y mendigas, no te para la lengua ni un minuto. No, no, this is all your fault pollo baboso ¿yo soy un pollo baboso? Tu eres pollo baboso tu eres un pollo baboso, te voy a agarrar del pescuezo y te voy a... No me andes apuntando, tu eres pollo baboso tu rancho va a estar lleno de puros pollos babosos y se va a llamar 'baboso ranch' he is waking up, he's waking up! Ugh... Where's cuco? Dad! I am okay. You saved me! Little one! Ohhh... The cape! Where's the cape? Don't worry, I got it ahhh, it's safe. Poor gayo! His legs must be killing him! I wonder why on earth did he let anyone change his routine on the first place all this trouble because of that El americano hoopla hoopla poopla ha ha ha please stop you cockatoos! [Music] The divas are right, it's all my fault! Don't listen to them cuco. Yeah the divas will always complain about something. But now my dad won't be able to stand to against Martin's challenge. We really need help... now! Yes paquito but who? Who can help us?, who? I can't think of anybody garza Garcia you're a genius! I am? We've got to find our superhero El americano and bring him back to help! But... but who?, what?, where? There-- ho-lly-woooood! I have not a clue what in the world are you talking about who would know how to get to... Garcia get divino, pronto! Divino? Uh... let me see... Uh... Tacos, tortas, tamales, Chimichanga, chiiiin. I will take you back to the circus and I... Hey! What's going on? Sorry to disturb you, oh great one, but you are the one that knows everything! Well yes, I don't like to brag, but I'll force myself to say yes, I do please tell us: How to get to Hollywood? Hollywood? Are you serious? Hollywood? Why would you want to go to Hollywood my dear boy? El americano lives in Hollywood we need help to save the circus from Martin and his gang of bad birds! ‘Whenever you're in trouble who will help you on the double?' El americano salva El día! That's very nice of you cuco but let me just say it, it's very, very nice is movie nostalgia... Every bird in and out the circus will be in danger if Martin takes over. We gotta to do something and we don't have much time! Yes I'm afraid that's an unfortunate truth, but listen cuquito I must warn you, according to the sacred scrolls written a long time ago before you were an egg, Hollywood is a place where dreams do come true but not always as expected, with a little change, but more often that not bad results of heartache and suffering... Cool. How do I get there? Is it far? Let us see now... Chin chupacabra... eh?... Que? Pero... he he he. Chin chalupa, cheech and Chong... I feel it coming and... There it is! I still got it baby! The secret scrolls, it will show you the way to Hollywood, if anyone ask you where you got in from? You did not get them from me thanks divino, I will take good care of it! Vamos para Hollywood are you sure you wanna come along? Hey, it was my great idea remember? You're right about that. Vámonos! Be careful, thoughtful, and hurry. ‘El americano salva El díaaaaa!' wait for me! Fly like the wind, fly, fly boy, and hey brings something, anything... No t-shirts, no t-shirts I'll get you for that. Diganme! Diganme! Did the, did the sabotage go according to my plan? Like a charm, boss! And gayo won't be flying or walking anytime soon. Magnifico! Lo único malo es que vimos la capa tirada y no se la pudimos traer porque... The boss doesn't need to know all that... pollo baboso. Pero no me pegues y no me estes... The important thing is that gayo's legs are broken but you promised no one would get hurt! Ay my dear rayito, those birds are the real villains here. They stole the cape from me, remember? And... you got my cape back, right? Well you see, we almost had it but vovo right here started to talk about pueblos and I don't know what yo no dije eso, tu fuiste pollo baboso tu decías que you want a ranch enough! There's no time to lose. Time to get that cape back! Síganme! Rest, sweet gayo, rest. Perdón, amigos. I hear my old friend gayo had a bad break! Martin-- you fiend! Aaggh... No, gayo , don't! This is an outrage, you have no right for this intrusion, you have not won the right to be here. Silencio! I have no need for petty rules! It is plain to see that poor gayo cannot defend the cape... From his bed! Ay poor, poor, gayo . Ha ha ha ha and now the cape. Where is it? Well don't just stand there tontos. Mi capa-- find it! ¿Cuando le decimos que ya no está? ¿Cuando sera bueno decirle que El canario se la llevó? Y que... What? Well we saw the yellow canary take it boss, the one that is always with the little green parrot. Fine, where are they then? Where? Where is your scheming son and that thieving canary? Cuco! Where's cuco? Rayito-- ransack this dump and flush out that cuco boy! Ahhh. Jefazo, yo creo que este maguito sabe todo, si creo que este maguito lo sabe todo! Oh, so... the old owl knows something after all. Yo? Me? I know... nada. Ash-- squeeze the truth out of this petty magician. Where... are... they? I'll never tell you stop it, don't hurt him. He's going to hurt! Martin, this is enough! Ash! Get him again! I can't, I can't, I can't... I know the parrot's plan! Divino, is cuco alright? Tell me what did you find? They went to Hollywood to look for... El americano. They went for a coffee? No, you fool, he's a famous super hero from TV! "Mom, dad I am going to get help, don't you worry." Oh, cuco! Rayito-- we need to, to find a plan to stop that blasted circus parrot, before he finds this super hero. ¿El Espresso? No, El es El capuchino no! El americano. He is El americano the most powerful superhero that has ever been. Ha! Cuco is going to bring him back and kick your tail feathers! Shut up! I... want... my... Cape... right... now! Honestly, Garcia, a fear of heights? We need to speed up! We might as well walk! What a great idea! I was joking! How about this: We can just fly across this canyon and then we can walk, okay? Okay but I'm doing this under protest. Aaaaaahhh! Keep up, Garcia, we can't fly for you, y'know! Slow down I'm seriously about to lose it. Ok, let's find a place to rest. Yes rest, my nerves! Ay, ay, ay, you crybaby. Hey, paquito, down there! Finally!, firm ground. Mmm, it seems a little cushy to me. Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy-- ha, this scroll is very puzzling. Hey guys come here: It says we need to keep heading north until we find the ‘eagle's rock. Where the eagle looks, you must go'. Then what? Seems that then we'll arrive at a place with a tall silver arch. It says ‘at the top, look for a big blue stripe. Follow it north and you can get to Hollywood! Hollywood yeh! It shouldn't be hard! Oh good, oh I want to get back at the safety of our whistle's tree. I hope Hollywood is nice at least, what you think is like? It must be a magical place. A little birdie told me once that there, all dreams come true... After all, El americano became a hero there! Ok guys, let's rest. Tomorrow is going to be a pretty busy day! Good night. Good night. Good... night. What's that noise? What? -¿Ves lo que yo veo? -No way! Wow! Paquito, where is Garcia? I don't know. Garcia! Garcia! Garciaaaaaaa! Estoy despierto, estoy despierto... Buenos días, buenos días, buenos dias. Man, I need to pee pee. Aaaaahhhhh! He is up there! He is up there! And he needs to pee pee. Quick paquito, let's go. [Shivering] [Exhales] Wow, what a view! I can't believe you two are enjoying the view when I am about to die. Well, if you want to get off of here, you have to fly! Hey those rocks look like an eagle wow, paquito, you're right-- it's the first sign from the scroll-- ‘find the eagle rocks overlooking the yellow canyon'! But, but, but... We're going the wrong way! Get up Garcia we've got to fly now! Listen, nothing is going's to budge me from this spot right heeeeeeere... Aaaaahhhhhhhh! -Fly, Garcia, fly! -Flap your wings! Aaaaahhhhhhggg! Garcia! [Echo] Garcia! I am alive, I can't believe it, thank you, thank you cuco. Im still alive. That was amazing, incredible! Oh, c'mon! Paquito's right I think El americano will be impressed. -You really think so? -Mm hmm. Let's keep moving, clock is ticking. Listen up, we don't have much time. The full moon is upon us, and without the cape, all our hard work is for nothing! Ash and I shall continue with plan x here at my lair. Dovo, vovo -- you two go north and nab that pipsqueak parrot before he reaches El Espresso. El americano. Latte, mocha, espress-- whatever! And what about me? Rayito, you're in charge. Just find that little runt and cut him off at the pass. Do whatever it takes to get my cape! And once you have your cape, you will let everyone go, right? But of course, my dear. Now be gone! Palomos... you know what to do if she goes soft. Jefecito nuestra mente es una trampa de acero, recordamos absolutamente todo. Don't you worry about it boss. Ay, ay, ay, par de pollos babosos! You lay back down right now, you need time to heal! [Groaning] How can I rest when our son is out there, who knows where? I just gave him an old mystic scroll... To will show the kid the way, look... I hope you can forgive me, it's all my fault. You meant well, old friend. Cuco is our best chance now. He's our only hope! And we need to get something for divino. What is this place? It looks like a place for lucha libre. Lucha libre huele mucho. Lets take a shortcut through here. It will be faster than going around and more fun. It seems like a bad idea. Paquito, could you please get him down. We gotta keep going! Wow, I love luchas, when I was a snorkeling my nickname was "El quebraplumas." Cuidado Garcia. [Grunts] Guys! Guys! Damas y caballeros, amable auditorio coming directly from Tijuana we present you the pride of Baja, the most terrifying luchador still alive... Feast your eyes on... Pancho 'El trueno' Gonzalez. Woaaaaaahhh, ha ha ha. It's been a long time since I was challenged, I can see that you are brave or fool enough to do so, now I will have to crush you and break your-- perfect, we-- I mean, I should get going. We need to find a city with a tall silver arch and-- I got my eyes on you. I'm not easily fooled and-- oh! The silver arch! I know where the silver arch is and I will gladly share that information with you oh really? Thanks! But first... you will have to defeat me in a lucha libre match. [Growling] Trueno, trueno te queremos... The champ is in great shape, ladies and gentlemen-- but I don't want to fight. What? You come here to my place, the legendary arena de lucha libre Marco 'El plateado' Perez... Que dios lo tenga en su Gloria, and you don't want to fight? What? You have offended me, and worst of all... You are disrespecting my audience, mi casa. As you can all see, trueno is in control... And looking great this evening. Let's see if his new opponent has what it takes. Insignificant, and you will be crushed, ugh! But now you will witness my famous "nudo tijuanense" yeeha! [El trueno] Could it be? Such a tiny opponent, so strong? A rookie luchador has given the champ a rough time? Not in this lifetime, amigo. Al fin trueno is going for the diving triple huracan. Ladies and gentlemen this is truly a sad historic moment. The champ has lost and he must give up his mask I cannot bear to watch it is the greatest humiliation for any member of the asociación de luchadores armadillos mexicanos a.C. My mask now belongs to you my brave opponent wait! Um... excuse me mister Gonzalez? I couldn't have defeated you, unless it was simply dumb luck! And besides I can't take your mask. I am not even a wrestler! Oh, I think you are right, I'm the champ and you are not even a luchador, all this was a show for my beloved fans. Ha ha ha. I'm sorry to lie but you know, it is a very sensitive audience. Right, but between you and me, you should really check out your eye doctor champ. Listen to the crowd, happy! Oh fighter, I can see that your heart is as big as your punch. You are truly like a luchador tecnico. Now, can you tell us where the silver arch is? Yes, of course my friend you are very near, you must head north. I mean north, I mean north, that's right! You will be in downtown Tijuana and there you will get to see the great silver arch thanks, champ. I hope we can fight again one day. Vaya con dios amigo mio, I will keep an eye on you fierce luchador. Bye trueno. Oh, I should wear my glasses more often, that's why I was defeated, they will fear them... And that's it for today, lucha libre time! See you soon! Those three birds should be about here by now... And there's an old mine here... This is the spot where we will stop them and take the cape-- si, si. (Speaking Spanish) Yes we have everything ready and we even brought disguises. Mua ha ha ha ha. Question: Why wear disguises? They make us look good. Si, muy super duper cool well, at least the disguises will fool the parrot and distract him. (Speaking Spanish) Whatever. Just make sure that nobody gets hurt. We're only after the cape. Cake? ¿van a dar cake? Con las ganas que tengo de probar El pastel no! No cake, cape! La capa! The cape! Pollo baboso. ¡Tu seras El pollo baboso! ¡Tu, tu eres El pollo baboso! ¡Tu eres un pollo baboso! I need water, I need a cold dip in the ocean, I need a raspado, I need some ice cubes, I need... A cave! A cave? We can rest in the cool shade there for a little while, but we can't stay loooooo... Ooooah-woah-woaaaah! Hey, be careful guys! Finally a little shade, ooooohooo take a look at this place, so dark and so mysterious. Ay! [Music] That was easy... Huh? So you two are brave fellows? But I really need to end this... I need that cape! Why are you making it too hard? [Music] I just want the cape! Paquito? Rayito? Rayito? Paquito? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wwwwhaaaaaaa! Can we do it again? Its a cave in. Let's go! Help! What in the world? Wait cuco! Is too dangerous! Auxilio! Cucooooooo! Where are you? I'm here! Down here! I need your help. Hey, wait! Aaaahhhhhh! Yes! Is everybody okay? Yo si, pero mis nervios no. Hey you two you wouldn't... Leave her, she is with them now. Hey, I know you... you're that girl that's with the bad guys! Is your name rayito? I'm dangerous. Hey, wait! Wait! Come back! She is no good. Come on cuco, we must move on. Rayito the hummingbird. That girl is bad news. I don't think so paquito, she is not like Martin. She tried to steal your dad's cape really? All this because of the cape? It must really mean something then, huh? I just wanna go back to our circus. Hey, now that looks like a smart and sophisticated fellow. Let me go ask him for directions no, wait! He's just a donkey! C'mon paquito, let's take a look from up there. Let's see... we need to find the arch... Trueno said it was near here. ¿Que onda morros? ¿que andan hacienda por acá?, se guacha que no son de aqui. Hey, guess what? That zebra speaks perfect donkey he just told me where the arch is. Wow Garcia that's great! Where? Pos guacha allá arriba morro ¿que no lo ves? There! ¿Esta curado no?

I may just be a plain and lonely surf rat but I do know someone who knows e.A. Bro. Good, because this zebra doesn't know anything else except for where the arch is. Garcia, this is Carl. Hey, what's up Garcia? What's up bro? How's it going dude? So, you have a friend who knows El americano? Wow, can take us to him? Her bro!

You should have seen him with the giant balloons, he saved me! And then he faced off with this massive luchador, he has incredible skills. Okay, mister skills. Show me a nice trick. Show him the super flip. Pretty good, not bad. ...and what about that little piñata? What's inside? Who are you calling piñata? I'm not a piñata. I'm a canary and my name is Francisco. I've never been so insulted in my life. Okay, okay. The talking piñata goes into the X-ray machine. Right now. Please step lively. What? No problemo is this radioactive? Sombrero please. Map, check. Cape, check. Tuba? Check. Radio/tv/alarm clock, check... burrito with salsa? No, that will have to stay with me. Thank-you. Have a nice day! Come on... next! Wow, I have no idea it would be that easy. You do know that they are birds. They could just fly over and not come through here. That's honesty, mister, and we appreciate that around here. Welcome to the United States of America! Gracias, I mean, thank-you! Fly straight, fly right! Great job ash. Now we're ready for the x-plosive finale of gayo and his pitiful old show, once and for all! But all of this is pointless unless I have... The cape, the cape. Ah, give it to me! Give it to me! Jefazo! Pues pasó que capaz, y luego que cataplum, que pacatelas, y entonces todo se vino pa'bajo y luego... blagh, blugh, blem, pum. Slow down, slow down! Boss, boss, let me explaining to you. We cornered cuco and his friends in this old abandoned mine. Y le dimos un espectaculo muy bueno y fresco con las botas picudas. That's it! I'm done with these two! Ash! Make some pigeon fricassee! Well, we had the cape, but we were betrayed by rayito... Si, fue la chica guapa, Ella es la traidora. Wow, you finally agree with me. Really? Rayito? ¿Dónde está? What is it with you two? I thought we were a team! You... you betrayed me! But, but... I... You want me to fail, don't you, rayito? You know that if I don't have the cape, all my plans will be for nothing! What are you talking about, Martin? I don't have the stupid cape, but I almost died trying to get it for you! Liar! I knew you would betray me some day... Ever since I saw that rage in your eyes the night you ‘lost' your parents! Mm, my parents? That's right, I took care of them for not obeying my orders. And now it seems history repeats itself! Ash! Rayito-- she's escaped! Get her and all of her pathetic friends! Do whatever it takes! Make them pay! Take no prisoners! And bring me that cape! -I love the zoo! -Viva San Diego! Wow, dude, there's Lucille over there, hey Lucille! Hey beautiful! Carl you surf rat. Give me a hug you hippie. Oh my old friend, oh, excuse me a second. Pavo cristatus chatty time? Get to work already! Isn't she the sweetest? Lucille, meet my new best bros from m.X.O. Garza garcía, paquito and my homie cuco. Welcome to the San Diego zoo, seriously boys, mi casa es su casa, how long can you stay? Actually, we need to get to Hollywood, pronto. Well, soon it will be too dark to travel. I could use a rest. Ha, ha, ha, ha, no, no rest for the wicked because tonight is party time! So Carl tells me you were a big star in Hollywood! Yes, well I had the acting bug back in the day, oh, I was the toast of Hollywood. Before becoming the queen of the roost here at the zoo. Did you ever meet El americano? He he he... oh yes, I used to know him... well. In fact, his real name is Eddie navarro wow, that.S amazing! I bet he's super incredible in person! Incredible? Let's just say El americano might not be what you imagine him to be. I'm sure he's even better! Cuco dear, it's time for the skate competition [music] Cuco bro it's your turn man, show them what you got! Really? You think I should join in? Yeah! Sure, show these whirly birds how it's done dear. Okay! Go cuco! Your boy is incredible. Totally! ¡salva El día super amigo! Here goes the super-flip on wheels! Glad you are up, but let's go you need an early start to catch your train. Carl are you coming with us? You know you are more than welcome. Oh I'd love to, but I have some major surfing to do here in sd, gotta workout my party belly, plus, the swells today are supposed to be shwwwwe-he-heaven. Thank you brah. You gonna need some grub. This should stick to your ribs. Don't worry darling, I packed it myself gracias por todo, Lucille! De nada, thank you for making my party so special. Cuco I want you to have this. You mean, you and El am... I mean Eddie navarro were... Yes, yes, well of course he wanted to marry me, but we weren't right for each other then, once in a while sure. He's just below the Hollywood sign! That's right. Gracias Lucille. Come on guys! Goodbye dear friends from Mexico, buena suerte. Do we have to fly all the way there? Farewell San Diego, hello Hollywood. -Oh, oh. -What is it paquito? Look. No, is that horrible hummingbird. Rayito, what are you doing here? Don't listen to her! It's a trick! Look, I don't expect you to believe me, just hear me out okay? Yes, I worked for Martin. I didn't want to, but I had to. He raised me, he adopted me, but... I've since learned that he was the one who... Who separated me from my parents! I didn't come here to tell you my sob story, I, I came to thank you for saving my life back at the old mine. I owe you now. You don't owe me anything but you did try to steal my dad's cape. I'm sorry. I guess I can't blame you for not trusting me, but I'll tell you everything so you know that I'm truly on your side. Like what? Well, you should know that Martin had the palomo brothers sabotaged the structure you built, and now he's holding your circus family prisoner! Oh, no! We have to go back! I feel for you, I really do, but you can't go back now! Why? Martin is crazy! Who knows what he'll do! Well I do. We must hurry and get El americano! Martin seems afraid of him. Can we trust her? It's okay, she's one of us now, -right, rayito? -Right! Go ahead, paquito, show her the map. Okay, it looks easy enough to find. And... What's that? Who's Lucille? Long story. It's ash! Eat this mosquito brain. Ay, ay, ay! That surely left him seeing little birdies. Wow! -We are okay? -Yes we are! Go and we'll distract him. You must leave now! Go find El americano! Oh my, I... I'm finally here! E-excuse me... a-americano? Who dares to enter eddy navarro's fortress i-i am a friend of Lucille's, sir... and a fan. A fan, really? Coming right down... Hello my boy, I am Eduardo tiberio navarro de altamirano but you can call me Eddie... Navarro. You are... El americano? Well, there is no real El americano my boy, but I was the star of that old show way back when, I have so many successful roles and El americano was just one of the little ones. But enough about me! You are here for my autograph aren't you? What's your name my boy? But what about all the bad guys you defeated? That's movie magic my boy, amazing huh? What about the super-flip and all of your amazing moves? The super-flip? No me acuerdo... ah! I remember that one, my stunt double came up with that one. You are... El americano?

Well, I'm glad everyone's fine and all... But still, there's no hero to help us... I failed. Excuse me... what? You just crossed the country to help your family! And just beat a giant vulture, saved everyone, this isn't TV... and still you proved you are the real hero here my boy. You deserve it! No, paquito. This is my dad's and he must have it... Let's get home and face Martin all together! What a great movie moment! With a full moon and all, it reminds me the telenovela I did... 'La Luna del amor, El retorno' oh my gosh, tonight is the full moon challenge! We'll never make it back in time! Eddie, how can we get to Mexico and fast? This is Hollywood, everything is possible here if you believe my boy, if you believe. Who are you calling? I am calling santar really? Your old arch enemy? Only on screen my boy we are actually very good friends, hey santar! I need a big favor right now, how soon can you get here? ¡Excelente! See you here! Santar is not far, so it shouldn't take long, wait here please, I'll be right back. Don't worry, we'll get to the whistle tree on time. Maybe so, but I worry about what Martin could be doing right now! Me too. A little goodbye gift specially for you... nuestro heroe. You were looking for a hero that could save your family but instead that hero was you. We all look outside what we all have inside of us. Open it, go ahead... And this time for real. Santar! Bueno, bueno, you should haul y buena suerte americano! Goodbye americano! And thank-you! Welcome to the new circo extremo de Martin the king Fisher...
