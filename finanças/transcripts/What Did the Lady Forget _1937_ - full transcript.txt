No using algebra A total of 32 coins... And no using real coins! Right! I've got it! It just takes patience No, that's wrong too You don't have to get upset about it They don't do this in junior If you could do it you'd say they do Couldn't the doctor find me a tutor? Perhaps from among his students I simply can't do it myself Please ask him You worry too much I don't really care who just so long as he's clean You're just after a Fredrick March type That would be lovely Please, I'm serious I'll keep my eyes open Don't forget, will you? Please, for Fujio's sake You're leaving? Off to the Ginza Today's act of motherly love My niece from Osaka arrives here tomorrow It'll be good to see her again I like the girl She's such a smart, tidy girl Goodbye! Goodbye! Didn't know you had a sister like this Be serious. Silly Goodbye I'm getting hungry Is there anything to eat? There are some biscuits Something a little more solid? Like what? What is there? Noodles? Noodles? How about sushi? A bit too cold... Then what...Rice? Topped with eel. But then again... You're hard to please Rice with a helping of eel on the side In a tiered box You eat a lot! Is one enough? If not, I'll have biscuits Stupid! Is the doctor home? No, he's at the university Right, he teaches on Wednesdays It's Nakanishi on the phone I'll take it in here Hello, I'm just testing now It looks bad for you You'll never have children Tidy this up, please Sir, it's time for your class Which room? Number 27 Okada! The book I ordered has arrived Can you bring it to my place? ?Salmonella was rife in the town of Frankenhausen? When Dr. Gartner discovered the baccilus name... ...after him in 1888 The mode of infection is yet to be discovered But a detectable relationship... ...has been established with the spirochette... ...of the encephalitic bacterium which reaches epidemic proportions Nowadays, what we call encephalitis... ...was identified by a Dr. Ekonomo in Vienna in 1919 Whether the two are the same or not is still a matter of speculation Looking beyond these questions... ...at Dr. Ekonomo's diagnosis of lethargic encephalitis... Like our friend here there's no evidence it attacks during winter So he doesn't have it Ready? Going back to the original question... Setsuko! Setsuko! No, I'm actually very good I can drive at 60 kph on Route 2 It's such a good feeling You want to come along? No thanks Your family doesn't object? I see, but it sounds dangerous You see, I'm the best road racer Shall I show you? So here's where you are I'm talking to uncle First put your bags away She's learning to drive Drive? There'll be none of that in Tokyo! Restrict your accidents to Osaka, please You smoke? Yes, I do It's bad for you! But you smoke! Put it out. You're still a minor I'll just finish it off Setsuko! Mind you wash behind your ears, young lady Are they dirty? Clean them for me Ugh! How dirty! Master Okada is here Good-day Please come in Am I intruding? Not at all. This is our niece Setsuko, Mr. Okada I owe a lot to your uncle Sir, I brought your book Good lad. Sit down It's alright. Please It's alright. Please How'd you like to be a tutor? What subject? Arithmetic. Exam preparations For Fujio In junior high, already? Will you? But children and I... It'd be easy for you. Please do it But the doctor... He approves, don't you? Then it's settled? You'll do it? Good! But Mrs. Komiya... It's been decided Thanks a lot! You're stuck with it Seems so Area of the sea is 3 times that of the land 3/4 of which is in the northern hemisphere How many times is the area of the sea in relation to land in the northern hemisphere? How many times... Well, that's... 3/4 of the sea is in the N.H... Wait, I just have the thing! It's easy when you use this That's a good idea! 3/4 of the area... Ethiopia's over here How many times is the area of the sea in relation to land Come in. Hello Studying? Did you get question three? How does it go? The earth's area becomes 1, then land area equals 1/4 So land in the N.H. is... 1/4 times 3/4 = 3/16 Therefore, the area of the sea... understand? 1/2 minus 3/16 Where'd you get the half? This? By calling the area 1 ... The N.H. becomes one half Oh, really? So the equation is 5/16 That's the sea area So 5/16 divided by 3/16... ...is 1 and 2/3, that's the answer Yes! That's right! Where'd you graduate from? The university You did graduate? Yes, I did Junior high, too? Yes. And you studied arithmetic? Of course So we've nothing to worry about So it seems Er...Ma'am... Setsuko? Please come in Hello It's been a while. Come in Everything's fine? Yes, thank you.

Where've you been out drinking until this hour? Setsuko I was fast asleep Felt good. Don't want to hear anymore What if something happened while he's away at golf? You're our responsibility! I've been worried sick! You could help by getting me a glass of water Setsuko! Quickly! Ma'am, the car that brought her home... With Mr. Okada? Was it raining when you got up? I wonder when it started? Probably around dawn I hadn't reckoned on that We were due for a change They're cooked, sir! Thanks! It's really pelting down It certainly is! That's not good What do you mean, sir? I sent a postcard saying the weather was fine A friend posted it from the golf course He should realise he's not that kind of man Really, sir? That is a problem It's not joking matter You think it rained in Izu? I can't tell Nationwide, don't you think? That is a problem They're done, sir! Fumiya? Is Aunty home? Home all day? She has no plans to go out Fumiya Fumiya Coming! Where's Setsuko? In her room She's not to go out Sure The master is back Welcome back To unseasonable weather How did it go? Just so so By the way... I'm angry with Setsuko Soon as you left, she was out the door! Carousing until one o'clock! Came home dead drunk! Drunk, you say? She treated me with contempt! And didn't listen to a word I said She came back with young Okada With Okada? If anything happens while she's in our care... You have a point there I want you to lay down the rules to her Right! Send her to my room! You uncle wants a word with you Uncle! Ah, Setsuko! I need a favour Yes? The postcard I had sent... I don't want your aunt to see it Why not? I wrote that the weather was fine Just leave it to me Will You've been at Okada's all this time? Yes I've got a terrible hangover Aunty's in a terrible rage She's said barely a word to me all day It was bad luck she found out Okada's role in this Fumiya saw us together And she's taken it the wrong way I wouldn't mind if he were at least handsome Understand! Look at me! Don't go gazing away! On your feet, young lady! I'm telling you for your own good When you go out, you tell us where you're going! And you can't stay out late! You should know better! Remember what he says, young lady! You understand? And pay heed to what your aunt tells you! You hear me? What a good liar! I'm surprised But... You're good and Okada and I are never right! This time you've no excuse And pay particular heed to what your Aunty says You understand? That wasn't her. It was the wind How stupid! Professor, this is very hard on me She got very angry with me Said I betrayed her trust and barred me from the house She misunderstood and it's more than I can bear Sir, please explain Sir, I'm begging you I considered telling her the truth You're right, but please just bear with it I'll return the favour one day. Please? I let him have a piece of my mind I introduced him to you but now I wash my hands off him He seems so upright, a lad of morals What is it? I'm embarrassed to say it Say what? What? You are But we've been married for 14 years Congratulations! It's nothing to be ashamed of Even hippos have babies Stupid! Dr. Komiya could attend to you I'd be indebted for life if he did Your husband will be thrilled He's sick in bed, now Since when? How's your husband? Why do you ask? Well, playing golf in the rain Rain? That's strange... ?Weather's fine?, ?Great for golf? That is strange The master has returned Uncle, something dreadful has happened She read the postcard! I thought I'd get to it first She's certainly fast Dear! You played golf with Sugiyama? Apparently it rained What's the meaning of ?Great for golf?? Aunty, forget it You shut up! It doesn't matter if it rained or not You shut up! Out, get out of the room! Out! Now! Isn't it strange? The same golf course and he gets wet ...you bathed in the sunshine If it rains the weather is certainly not ?fine? ?Great for golf?, did it rain all around you? He got bad cold Can you explain how that happened? Can you tell me why? Your guests are leaving You should see them off I'll get to the bottom of this I'm hungry Ask for eel. They do wonders with it Why the hurry to leave? Stay a little longer Why don't you take your time? I was going to order eel, your favorites Yes, but... You'll leave? See you soon Fumiya, our guests are leaving! Fumiya! Fumiya! Don't forget The master? He left through the garden That was close. They barely made it Your Aunt is fuming! Don't worry about it! Are you really frightened of her? Not what you'd call frightened Then why so glum? Drink up You worry too much about her That's why she walks all over you I'm just the niece. You're the husband! The master! If it were me, I'd tell her! Fickle like the weather I'd make her change! But...I couldn't You can, you just don't Want to go to the geisha house? I'll pay Uncle, let's go Uncle. Doctor! let's go! Welcome home! Where've you been? Setsuko! Where did you go? Where? You've been drinking again! I told you before! What have you two been up to? Setsuko! Answer me! Speak up! Say something! We went for a walk Setsuko! I've had enough of you! Enough! Back to Osaka! She doesn't have to You shut up! Out! Go home! Not at your command I'll go when I'm ready! What? You put her up to this! That's why she's so insolent You're the insolent one! I treat you well and you try to walk all over me Just think a little If she doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to Well done! She needed that That made me feel good I'll sleep well tonight I'll go to bed, goodnight! Aunty! I was very rude Please forgive me! It just slipped out It all became so complicated Of course he's wrong, too He didn't play golf that day Perhaps I shouldn't say this But sometimes he doesn't want to He stayed the night at Okada's place Before that, he was with me I'm sorry I drank and made a fool of myself and made you worry Forgive me! I was wrong So of course you're right to be angry with me But I feel sorry for Uncle I was wrong and I ask for your forgiveness You weren't wrong So you don't have to say sorry. But... Please forgive me! I'm sorry for what I did I couldn't control myself... but hitting you was wrong You have a right to be angry, but forgive me It was very wrong of me No, I made a mess She said you stayed at Okada's instead of going to golf Well...yes You believe me? I didn't know so I just assumed the worst I didn't have a chance to tell the truth Okada came out worst of all I'm grateful you understand me I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry Well...goodnight! Dear...! Why the funny face?! Uncle! What is it? I covered for you There was no need for you to apologise, too? She had to You started out well but finished terribly Let's see it again! The man should be stronger That was sufficient Not at all That's something you don't understand yet Some men treat their wives badly But that's not a good thing Wives should be respected They like to think they're in control so it's better to let them think that... like scolding children by praising them That's the best way, the opposite approach Opposite approach? I've never thought about that I've have to remember that I would like to see that A real hard one? How many times? Once. Where? Across the face A good solid whack? Yes Did it hurt? Not really...no! My husband's a wimp, not so much as a love tap With a face a like that... Fool! You think it'll suit him? Too colorful What? He's still young I'll get one, too Sorry for you, no-one to buy for What about Fujio? Stupid When's Setsuko leaving? We're eating out tonight and she'll leave from there to take the 9pm express You should've brought her along with us But she's out shopping with Okada ?Opposite approach?? I didn't know, myself We're both a couple of fools Don't use it when we marry No, I'd never You probably will I'm the straightforward type Flattery will get you nowhere If you do, I'll use the ?opposite-opposite? approach When are you coming again? For the college baseball match I'm a Waseda fan I like Waseda, too Flattering again Sounds like ?opposite? This time tomorrow, I'll be in Osaka I wonder where she is by now? Around Numazu, I guess She's probably fast asleep Probably The house seems very lonely with her away She'll come again, soon It'd be nice to have her come often Yes Would you like a coffee? I won't be able to sleep You'll sleep well Fumiya! Goodnight!
