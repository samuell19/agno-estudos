Thirty five sovereigns Sir... It's forty sovereign Sir! Why are you guys confusing us? I missed it due to stress sir. Please trace our jewels Sir. -Ramar brother! Oh God, what will I do now! Shall we file a FIR sir? -Get a written complaint, FIR not required. -OK Sir! They always keep it there. OK! Let's go! -Karuppu! -Sir? Who could have done it? Front gate lock is intact. So it is not Ravi gang. Latch is not cut and that too is intact. Attempted to break the side wall. They knew about the back door. Had tried opening with keys but failed. So it is not Mani's team as well. They haven't even broken through the window. That's not possible. I checked it. So it is not Murugan's gang either. They have navigated all through the house like a dog sir. Hard to guess. How else would they have barged in? As far as I know, it should be... How else would have they come? Neighbours say that the Lady keeps the house keys in the shoe stand. While the neighbor knows about it why not them? They had cooked food and had it before leaving. Sir! Sir, that lady said her in skirt was missing. May be it is Paavaadai Ramesh. Don't think it's him. Paavada Ramesh doesn't take the bra along. But the bra went missing. Such a chaos! They have tried like Ravi, Mani, Guna, Ramesh and Murugan... ...just for the sake of confusing us sir. Sniffer dog and forensic needs to reach for us to decide. By the way sir... Adding to it, the man says 35 and lady says 40 sovereigns. They too seem to trick us too. Going nuts with them! -They've come to see you. -Greetings Sir Jiju, look at me. What are you doing? Look at me cutie. -What's up with you Jiju? What are you doing? Look at me. What are you doing? Would definitely need your cooperation. Jiju, look at me. What's this? What happened to you Jiju! WHAT? Get lost! Hey go away! Tell us why you've come now! Karuppasamy temple festival was suspended years ago. Due to communal riots. Now the whole place is coming together to conduct it. Spoke to the priest already, we wanted to ask for a couple of PCs for the event. Please, somehow help us out this time sir. It is for a good cause. Would be happy to help. Vembu, Please come here! Whatever he says please have it written. Address it to the Inspector. Sir, She will write down as you say... -Please have food and leave. -Thank you so much Sir. Sure we shall have good and leave, Sir Hey Kicha! Sir? OK Sir Hand this at Parithi's place Brother, I am going home I shall take it. OK done. Give it. OK Careful! Hello Sir! Why so late? I'm hungry already. Got delayed in the temple. I was helpless. Sit down I shall bring a plate. Here, have food. Why don’t you sit with me? Are you going to sleep? Phew! Don’t know how you can sleep so well. Not sleepy today... Didn't I tell you day before? Ear piercing ceremony for Inspector's granddaughter. So inspector is out of town. I am the station HO today. I got to leave at once. You came just now! Got to get back to station immediately? I am pretty scared. Feels like its paining. Can’t you stay with me? Hey! Please do not leave me at this time. You are not getting me. Unless I resume duty today I may not be able to take off from tomorrow. So? Why do you do this? If I suddenly get pain? What am I to do? Don't worry about that.

I get labor pain. You carry me and rush to the hospital. With your eyes full of tears. But I was fearless. Because you were around. You admit me to the hospital. You get all dressed up like a Doctor. You were there by my side holding my hand. With teary eyes... I scream... And there comes a Simba like you. And they hand it to the daddy lion. Seeing you hold it with both your hands... Here take your son. This is what I went through so much for. I am free for the next two years. I am looking at you implying we shall have the second child then. Do you know how you react? You are teary eyed. Your face is red. Looking at your child... You give him a deep kiss Same way! You knocked the door and ended my dream. Didn't kiss me even in dreams. Forget about kissing! Even in the dream both our parents didn't come is it? Not sure guess they didn't. What's wrong with you? You always whine about this. Listen my baby... Like your dad... You too must be a mom's child OK? Hey what happened? Huh? Your son is approving it by kicking. Fine! Did you note down the required medicines my sister told? Yeah got it. You wipe up, I'll take leave. Hey! Leave quickly! First thing post-delivery, we'll go to your house and... ...place the baby at your Mother's feet and... ....I'll patch you up with you Mother. Hey Simba! Heard your dad talk so much! But never did he talk about his in-laws. Can't hear? Yeah right! Even in dreams your parents come before me. Look at her telling tales.

Definitely all of us will attend Sir. You are retiring in three months, why hurry now? Don’t you know?! Thousands would attend the funeral of a DSP’s dog, when he is in Service. But post retirement, even if the DSP dies, no one would care. So decided to get her married while in service Hey! Onto a good occasion, do not talk nonsense. -That’s OK. -No it is not. -I will be there in a jiffy. -Where's the inspector? Let me try calling him Sir. You got to have lunch at my place.

His daughter’s marriage, later her baby shower, all that is our business. Don’t we know! We know how to go about our business. Your job is to file a FIR against a complaint, right? Hmmm!

They cannot betray us anymore. May I know who you are? Hello The number you're trying to reach is currently switched off. Please... Yeah! Tell me Parithi. Sir! In the forest near Olaiyur... There seems to be a decomposed corpse. I got a call from an unknown number. What the hell? I got the address. If I call back, the number is switched off Sir. Parithi! May be it is a regular prank to trick you. No Sir! Have not received any such calls from that area so far. Moreover... MLA's brother in law's place too is close from there. That's why I am wary about it. Shall I go and find out? Uhhh... Do this. Go to the spot with Utthaman. And call me from there. Got it? OK Sir. Utthaman Anna. This has become a routine for them. Someone kills and it becomes our headache to clear the mess. Huh? If I get hold of the murderer... I'll hurt him like hell. -Uhhh! -Who's it? Revathy! Oh! She is expecting any time. Hey! For the kind of work we do. Staying back and taking care will not work. How do we manage time for that? Why not send her to her parents? Ahh brother! We eloped from our houses and got married right? They are totally annoyed about it. After which they just talk to her only. -Oh! -They don't talk to me. I too don't talk to them as well. If she goes to her parents... ...she fears I may not turn up. What's the issue? You both are of the same community right? Same category, Yes! But we're from different sub caste. Oh! Parithi! In such a massive forest... ...where to look in? Not sure how. Did he give any identification? Huh? Here it is. The milestone. This stone was the identification. Is it? Huh! The number you have dialed, is currently switched off. Please call again later. Why the phone is always switched off? What do we do Parithi? This stone was the identification. He mentioned “west side of the mile stone” West? This is the western side. Come let's find out. Come on. Parithi! Come on! They've completely beheaded him. What the hell? “Brother, You always brag about your experience” ...you can't even withstand this? If I have experience... Won't the stench get into my nostril? Yes, Sir! Tell me what's up? It’s a 174 Sir. Unidentified body. Almost decomposed sir! Head is chopped off. Spot PM is to be done Sir. What the heck? Can’t I attend a family function in peace? Who is it? Is it MLA's brother-in-law? Unable to identify the face. Thought of talking to them after reporting to you. Could be aged between 35-40 years. I shall talk to them Sir. Fine. Don't disclose over phone... Get them to come over. Is there any other missing case? No one in this age group at our station. I'll ask to enquire in the nearby station. OK! I'll request DSP to come in person. You do one thing. Get our photographer Selvam to come. And take pictures. Do not hand it to anyone else. Do you get it? OK Sir. I'll make him come, thank you Sir. Bro, inform the station and have them come here. Mandodhari Madam! Got to the forest with that unknown caller's lead. Hello! Is it Senguttuvan's brother? Yes Sir who's this? It's me, SI. -Tell me Sir. -Can you please come over? -Need to talk. -Yes sure sir. I am away shall reach the station in ten minutes. Not to the station. -Do you know Olaiyur forest? -Yes Sir! Get there! Do you mean to the forest? -Yes! -Forest? Please tell me what it is about. Sir! -Why don't you please come over? -OK Sir. Utthaman Sir. Look at this. What happened? Muthu, Please check if this is your brother. Unable to identify with the face. Physique doesn't look like it. Can you please let them show his right hand? Venkat, show it. This is not my brother. How do you say? My brother lost his ring finger in his childhood. He got hurt in the ring finger... ...and lost it. Finger is fine in this corpse. Physic too is not such. So this is not my brother Sir. OK! -You may leave. -OK Sir. Hey Parithi. What's happening here? What are you guys up to? I was happily inviting my friends to my daughter’s wedding. And you call me to take a look at a corpse? Where's the Inspector? He said he was patrolling in the morning. And now he claims to be in an ear piercing ceremony. If he is not willing to work... ...ask him to take VRS. Sir this is... ...uh..seems like there is a motive behind this murder. They've slit his throat and beheaded him sir. What the heck is this? -Chopped the head off? -Yes Sir must be a strong motive behind. Look here Sir. The track goes this way sir. Look here. Track is up to this... It’s not 2 or 3 people sir. Must be just one killer. Because… Killing must have happened here... ...and dragged the body till there. Unable to proceed beyond must have left the corpse there. Must be two to three days since it happened Oh! -Any missing case in the station? -Uhhh... Senguttuvan's missing case Sir. -He is Senguttuvan's brother. -Come on, is this your brother? No Sir! Ask your MLA to lodge a complaint. -Sure Sir. -Else they will drive me nuts. Hey photographer come here. Show it! Publish the picture in tomorrow's newspaper. Hand over ten pictures at the station. OK sir! OK you go ahead. Where's the writer? Who was on duty yesterday? Chockalingam Sir! -Get him here. -Brother! -Sir -Didn't you come this side yesterday? I came Sir. -Oh reall? Lousy work! -Heard some noise upon reaching here. Looked around. Couldn't find anyone so left the place. How can you be so ignorant in your duty? This place is chaotic already. No one is responsible enough. And I end up in a mess. Disperse the crowd now. Clear them now. Send them off. Clear the crowd. -I should see no one around. -Hey Parithi. Come here! Please watch out for a minute. Come on disperse! Unable to identify who's dead. Take a complaint from VAO as the first step. -Complete those formalities first. -Yes Sir. OK Sir Stay back till dawn. - I Shall tell you about furtherance then. -OK Sir. Got it? Yes Sir! OK Sir! And then... ...ask your inspector to report tomorrow morning OK Sir. I'll take him on. Sir! I wanted you to stay back and you are here. Unable to take the stink for a long time. You just left me all alone. Goodness! Such a puky smell. How are you going to guard it overnight? Ya ya you must be kidding. Make Karuppu come over for it. If he can break the bones of the accused... Why can't he try and guard to find out which is difficult. He is bigmouthed. -Brother! -Hey Parithi! What's it? -Some noise out there. -Why are you rushing? Come on tell me. Oops! Oh my God! What's all this? Where the hell is the head?! Hey! Sir. Sir! Sir! Stop there! Show me your bag. Sir, What are you looking for? Sir What should we do now? Tell me Parithi! Uh...Sir... A terrible mistake happened sir. What happened? Head... ...is missing sir. What are you saying? Hey! Stop the car! What the hell are you saying? Well... The head is missing from the corpse sir. We have just the body now. How can you be so careless? What the fuck were you guys doing there? Does DSP know about this? It happened while he was around... But he is not aware. You, Parithi... I should not have trusted you. It's on me now. Come what may, find the head. Or else no one can save your ass. What the hell is happening here? Why is that you get into such chaos? OK, relax, let's search for it. Search! DSP is calling! Fine, give it to me. I'll talk to him. Hello! Hey! What's all this? Inspector is reporting that the head is missing. Till the head went missing, what the fuck were guys doing? Yes he lost it, what to do now? Fuck off and give the phone to him. He wants to have a word with you. Here... Hello! Hey Parithi! Where the fuck were you until the head went missing? Sir! It went missing while you were around. What? It went missing when I was there? Hey! If you drag me into this, I'll become wild. I never came to the spot. I am no way related to this. I am retiring in 3 months. If the head is not found by tomorrow morning... Everyone of you will be fired. Hang up now! Sir! Cut the call you asshole. What is he saying? Sir! Constable! Is everyone assembled? Sir! I tried calling everyone. Everyone is on duty. Only 8 people are available in our station. Of which, two of them need to stay back. So brought the other 6 here. With just 6 people, searching in such a big of forest is impossible you know! Sir! Who are they Karuppu? I knew we won't have enough people in our station. That's why I brought folks from our quarters. They are all our department friends sir. Have them look around the forest. Everyone, start looking around. -Ok sir -Search every inch of the forest. Get going! Thanks Karuppu! Why thank me? Let's go sir. Come on. Do not distress yourself with what they say sir. Do not ride over it. We'll find the head sir. Oh God Careful careful! What happened? -I am alright sir. -Be careful. I am fine sir. There's a pit here. Hope you are alright. I am fine, sir What's it sir? Nothing! Hello! There's a pit here. Please be watchful all of you. Constable! Place this stick here. Give it to me sir. Sir, What happened? Sir! Hey! Ramaiah! Sir, watch out sir! Careful Sir! Karuppu, listen up! Accused is somewhere around here. He is closer to us. If we look around here... We can find him. Parithi! Parithi! Revathy had a fall. Got hurt in the belly. And she is hospitalised. My wife is with her. When was this? Just now they called me. Which hospital? Stanislaus Hospital. Sir, you please leave. Sir! Finished scouting around this side. Couldn't find it. It is pitch dark out there. Parithi! Parithi, you please leave. I shall take care. Move and get going. Move fast. Parithi! Come on. Hop on Parithi! Sit behind sir. Just leave, I'll take care. -You please get on the bike sir. -We'll take care. Hey! -Found anyone? -Do not spare him. Go, don't stop looking. Karuppu, go carefully. She never listened when we told not to marry a policeman. Can't you take care of a pregnant lady? I casually came there to visit her. She is completely swooned. Is your job a priority than this? Tell me! Hey! Come here! Well... She was craving to eat something.. So I went home to bring some food. Came back to see her lying on the floor. Please pardon me. Don't feel bad, go and relax. Sir, go find out the status. Madam! Revathy... Scanning is done. Let's wait for the reports. No hurry for the surgery. Let's wait her to get the labor pain. Shifted her to general ward. Go meet Dr. Annie there. OK, Relax! Calm down. -Look at her. -Come come. Come! Didn't I tell you not to leave me alone? You promised to be by my side. The moment I fell down, I screamed your name. You know how many times I called you? But you never turned up. Sorry dear! Very sorry! Do not cry dear! Why are you crying so much dear? Why do you cry? Don't cry and put your health at stake. Stop crying, dear! Stop crying! Please remove the bangles and anklets. Else might cause bruises when she gets the pain. You never came for my baby shower. It's good that you made it now. Already bought bangles for your baby showers. Had everything in place already. Please do the honours. Take this. Dear! Your turn. -Put the bangles. -That's OK Mam. Its OK! Please, put it on. You did not take good care of me. You might have to hold the baby as soon as it is born. Look after my child properly. Why so much crowd here? All of you wait outside. Let her take rest. Let's go. Please wait outside. I told you to remove the bangles but you are still wearing them. Doctor! You have scheduled the surgery tomorrow. Let me wear it just today. Let me administer you the injection. Get me the injection please. You are not supposed to photograph the new born. Keep the phone inside. Hello Thsi is the SI here. Are the photos... ...already printed in the paper? No No! Nothing. Make 4 more extra prints and give it in our station. What happened Sir? Are the pictures out in the press? It's been printed already. Fucking hell! Got the head yet? No No No... Please look for another one hour. Kindly oblige. Please stroll for another half an hour. Half... Can't you search for another half an hour? By then it will be dawn. Please listen to me. Just half an hour... Karuppu, Karuppu! Suspend the look out. -Let all of them leave -Sir! Tell them. Everyone leave the place. Hang up now. Sir! Sir! I am blessed with a child sir! Thank you sir! Karuppu! Karuppu! Sir! Come! Go to the ATM. Withdraw one lakh. Ok, Sir! What about it, Parithi? Were you able find the head? Could not locate it, sir! What? Couldn't you find it? We looked for it! Unable to find it, sir! Hey! How the fuck can you be so careless? We already are… …in a deep trouble This is adding fuel to the fire. I’m going nuts about it. You’ve been framed in the recent communal riots. And you’re on a memo transfer now. I can't do anything now. Fine, wait for sometime. Let me have a word with the DSP. Here, you! Get some tea. Sir! Hey Parithi! Where are you? I am in the hospital sir. You come to the spot right away. DSP too is coming. He might demand money as he is not involved in this. Would expect something out of it. You! Make Uthaman talk to him. Here Sir! What if he demands money right away? Do you have money? -Or do you have to arrange it? -Karuppu! -Hello! -Sir! Hey Parithi! Tell me! Don't you have money? Or Should I arrange it with someone from the station? Yes! I have money sir. Fine then! Come over to the spot soon. Is it the Inspector? -Is he asking you to come? -Yes! Guys, Please have some tea. What's it? Hmmm! He might have got pissed as I wanted him to buy tea. Tell them to move away. Sir, no sir! He is not at fault at all sir! -Yes sir! -Please wait! Even yesterday… …a suspect escaped from the forest. He is on the look out sir. He will trace very soon sir. It is because you have erred. You are out to rescue him. Why become involved? We might afflict ourselves. The SP, Karthi escalated to the higher officials. Let that be sir! I plead you to give us some more time. Take one more week. But crack it. Or else we’ll pin him and renounce. This is good enough sir! Will track down in a week sir! Thank you sir! -Hey! Come here! -Sir! What's their problem? They are looking for that SI sir. Parithi! Hand the money to Yogi. Hey! From the Doctor to the SP, disburse the amount as and when I tell you to. Ok sir! Because we are doing it here. We can cover it up right here. Hey! Sir! Who is the PC? Come! Hey! Arrange for the autopsy soon. Ok sir. Parithi! You got one week in hand. You might have to track the person down. By then we can locate the head… …bury it and close the case. Or else… I myself will put the onus on you and wash my hands off. The head… …will go to the lab. Do you get it? Deal the lab assistant… …with some bribe. To the chief inside… …bribe some money. I will handle the RI. Sir RDO? RDO isn't a big deal. You may go! SP might flare it up sir. That's can be dealt with. Have Kartheepan come over. Then… …let the driver not smell it. Evading him from coming here was not an easy task. Get back to work. Then Parithi… How's Revathy? Yesterday… She slipped and had a fall sir! Oops! How's she now? Has she delivered? Not yet sir! Got to do a surgery. Calm yourself! Things will be alright. Do not lose heart, Parithi. OK? You go and take care of her. Hello! Tell me! How is Revathy? She is fine dear. Sir, he is the one. She is pissed at you. Just a second I’ll call back. Are you the one who called to intimate about the dead body? Yes sir! What's it for you inside the forest? Sir! I came to hunt a rabbit yesterday. In the rabbit trap… I saw this corpse sir. Then… …I got panicked… …and called the SI sir. When we called back, the phone was switched off. It got switched off sir. You! Crook! Tell him you got to reach home. I will call you back. Hey! Why are you stopping here? Why do you have to stop? Who are you guys? Do not stop the vehicle in the middle of the road. -Check with the one on the top. -Move the vehicle. One of our man is murdered. Aren’t we not supposed to involve? Your man? Do you mean you know him? Yes sir! He is related to us. Yes, he's related to us. Sir! They claim the dead man is related to them. Sir! Looks like they know the dead man is their relative. What's his name? Hey, What's his name? No clue about his name sir. But he is my relative. You bloody! Playing prank? How come he is your relative but you are unaware of his name? Huh? Sir. Please listen sir. All the ones with rose color band are our men. Take a look sir. Hey! Does this band affirm he is your man? You are sounding very silly. Karuppu Karuppu! Hey! Let him be your man. Check with all your relatives. If any of your men are missing… How's that even possible? Our men constitute one and a half crore in Tamilnadu. Can we go door to door? Aren't you the cop? Find it out. Isn't it not your job? Karuppu, check what it is. Stop the bike. Stop it. Hold on! Hey, get down! Give the phone! Show that picture. Who clicked it? I am the one. How's it relevant? Sir. What's their problem? They have a color band and claim to be their relative. Hey, they claim him. Their opposite group sir! What is the color of the band Karuppu? Lavender color. We need to see him sir. -Parithi -Send them off post enquiry Sir! Hey, get on to the vehicle and leave. -Go man, just get away from here -Why are you driving us away, sir? How come two gangs are here? The corpse’s hand has… …two color bands. Both the groups claim the dead to be their man sir. Looks like a pandora's box If they get to know the head is missing… -They will bury us here. -You get inside. Better get in. Karuppu, come here. You get to the other side and stop people from getting inside. Hey! Hold all of them in the town hall. Tell Kicha to take 5 food packets from each hotel. Feed all of them. Ok sir! Move away. Always creating ruckus. Where are you? This way please. Yeah! -Parithi? -Yes Bhai! When did it happen? Not sure when. Yesterday evening is when we identified the body. -Come, Let's take a look at the body -Yes , come on. Looking at the corpse, it is too confusing. Deformed too much. -That's what is fishy. -Is it Bhai? Let the Doctor come. Sir. Didn't you see the head on that corpse yesterday? Yeah! See if it matches with any of it in the album. Venkat, come here. I'll check if there are other photos. If the driver calls you, don't tell him you're on duty. -Hello Sir. -Hello Doctor! What happened? You must have arrived at something by now. Doesn't look good, it is confusing. Unable to get a hang of it. Take a look at the corpse and let us know Doctor. Yeah ok! Parithi! Check this album. I shall check the phone. None of it is matching with this Bhai. -PM report shall be ready in 2-3 days. -What is the Doctor saying? -Sir. -It's done, sir. What's it, sir? From the dead man… …the brain… …will liquidify in 4-5 days and start oozing out. The head was in the sand and… …in that sand… …no such chemical components are found. Looks like the corpse was burried for 4-5 days and then taken out. Even though the corpse is here now. It was somewhere else a day ago. If a corpse is in an open place… …the part of it in contact with the mud… …will biodegrade. But this corpse is fully biodegraded. So, this corpse has been… …definitely buried by the killer. The wound on the body… …and the wound out of chopping the head… …are 2-3 days apart. Then, how would have he died? That can be inferred after locating the head. What am I supposed to do now? What's your plan? Karuppu! Sir! Femur is there in this. Head is there in that. He's got the money. Sir! Yeah! Got to identify the dead man in a week. Got to bury the head here. And shall hand over the bone to the relatives. -OK! -If it's not traced? Uhh… If not traced, will send the head to Chennai for skull imposition. You mean to say, there is head in it? Yeah, it is there. Be watchful, man, it seems too heavy. Mocking us, you fuck! Kicha, come! See you, sir! See you! Thank you sir! See you! Sir! Sir! Post mortem is over sir! OK! Hey, What are you guys up to? Start the vehicle. Karuppu! Sister Chandra called and wants you to come to the hospital immediately. Why? Surgery is to be done immediately. Your signature is required. Where? She has been taken to the operation theatre. Started? Yes! God! Everything should go well. Oh God! Sir sir! Congratulations sir! One of you please come inside. You go! Feeling very happy. The baby looks just like her mother. Baby is in the incubator. We get to see in three hours. How is my daughter Doctor? -Yes, she's fine. -Sir, Doctor! Doctor! Revathy! She is fine and will be out in sometime. Sir, let me buy some chocolates. -Please hold on. -Ok sir. -My dear! -Sweetheart! -Feeling elated dear! -My good lord! You have won. Like you wanted. It's a girl. From now on… She will be your queen. It won't be me anymore. What's it? Is she just like you? Sir did not see the baby yet. I wanted you to be the first one to hold her. Sorry darling! Just now the surgery got over. -Stop crying. -Move aside sir. Sir! What's it, Karuppu? -Enquired all over? -Done sir! Such a mad traffic. Hello sir! Hey Kicha! Handover the basket and come. How is the baby, Parithi? She is fine. Did you see her? Not yet. Why so? Come let's go take a look. The baby is in the incubator. Will take another two hours. Two hours is it? Crappy fellows. What happened yesterday? Found something? This is what we found. Can't we proceed the enquiry with this? From dentist to the passer by, we enquired everyone. No clue! Wandered overnight wastefully! -Gave the basket? -Yes sir! What kind of light is this, sir? Are you out on hunting? Hunting? This is used while going on hunting sir. Fine, How do you know that? Well, neighborhood place Olaiyur's folks livelihood is hunting sir. That's why I asked. Have seen them having this? They are the ones who use light with skin slings. How come you are having their light? Is it Oliayur folks? Hey! Oliayur folks sought our permission for their local event day before. Our Vembu is deputed there. Every man in the town will be there. Did you forget? Let's go there soon. Hello sir! Vembu, Where are you? On duty in Olaiyur temple sir. Accused too is there. Sir what do you mean? Is everyone gathered there? The whole town is gathered here sir? Do not let anyone out till I reach. I shall be there in ten minutes. OK Sir! OK Sir! Hey, where are you guys heading to? -Going to the shop madam. -Get inside. Get in now. Sir! What's it? -Not letting us out, -Who's stopping you? It’s the cops. Cops, is it? A function is happening after a long time. -Search without disturbing that. -OK Sir! Is everyone from the eleven house clan assembled here? -Are you guys here? -Yes! It's been ages since the festival was last conducted. Any misgivings in this place… ...be it a step forward or backward… ...seek apology. -Het, that Police is here. And will you pay the penalty to God? All partners, pay 11.25/- If we play udukkai and cry out for God… All Gods will appear. We need our God, Karuppu! Blindfold everyone and notify our Karuppan! Marlaali is to come! To conduct the festival. This place will flourish. The chief of this place is here. He too has make decisions. Impelled to God's and King's terms. Have hidden three signs here. The one who locates all the three places. Will take the role in our Karuppasamy temple… …as marlaali. Whatever the marlaali says… …all of you should budge. If any of you violate it… …consequences will be terrible. Ok, let us begin. The one who is scared of us is the accused. What? 500 feet away at the back of the temple. Under the sacred fig tree… …an object is hidden. Chief's son told me… …if you could grab it …rest is on us. Understood? Hey, grab only that one thing. I shall make you Marlaali. Once you become Marlaali. The temple will come under our control. I shall take it, look for the rest. Do not pretend too much, come on. Hey, he is coming. Go move fast. Go get away go. Hey Hey! They are here too. Come on man. Sir! Karuppu! Note it. Look at his leg. Go bring the light. Hey! Come alone, come aside. -Let's deal with it after the function. -OK Sir! Brother! Who are you? Tell me. This is Karuppu here! Karuppu? Where are the things then? Stop it, stop it. On the lap of... Such a magnanimous Goddess, ...a fruit... ...is glittering. Go grab it -Go now. -Go!

That thing you are looking for… …you will get it. Wherever you go… …keep me in your mind. Go! From now on wherever you go… You will be victorious. Vicotry everywhere. Come here. Just go. Give me the plate with ashes… Give it. Just go. Give it off. Just give. Get him down. Get him down. Take him away. We got our Karuppasamy as per the wish. We have given farewell to Karuppasamy. Might have to see off the rest of the Gods. Come on. Those who play the band, come over. Come, sir let's go catch him. Karuppu! Our folks are surrounding him. He cannot slip away. Come! Bless him. Let's move. Where have they kept it? -Tell me. -They are here. Keep pretending. Just stop. He is going overboard not knowing that those things were located already. It is underneath. What's in there? It's here. What's in there under? Cheater. Hey don't mock at the God. If anything is there ask him to unearth it. There's an object underneath. Listen to me, It's in here. Take it out. Take it out then. Why are you dipping? Pull it out. The Gos is struggling so much? Hey! Look down! Lookd down! Hey! Tell me now. If you're ready to break your marriage remarry someone from our clan... ...I'll write off all my assets in your name. What are you even talking Uncle? I asked you since my wife and kids were keen on it. But you resonate mom's thoughts. Hey! My Brother in law didn't earn all this for your wife and kids to enjoy. Hey Uncle! She's my wife. Go ask her to demand her brother. He's saved a lot of money by fucking over the world. Filthy bitch wants a car ride! How dare you call her a filthy bitch! Hey Hey! Aye! Die you asshole! Oh lord! My dear son! I gave my everything to raise you! But you never listened to me. Oh God! I asked you not to marry this bitch. You guys killed him! (sobs) Oh lord! You killed my husband, just the way you told the other day. Hey get lost! Hey! Stop it. Hey! -Calm yourself! -Take her away. You'll rot in hell. Will you please shut up? Shut up and sit in that corner. -Please keep quiet. -Calm yourself dear. Oh lord! Oh dear lord! You're here finally! What have u got for my son? -What have you got? -Don't cry, please relax. What have you got for my son? Why are you raging at that man? He's the one who killed him. I know he did it. My husband attacked him with a sickle since he used filthy words to abuse me. He screamed he would kill my husband with his own hands. Hmmm! What's the problem? Senguttuvan's maternal uncle has come sir. His wife is blaming him for the murder. We're enquiring. Sir! Hmmm! None of them were happy in Senguttuvan marrying that lady. They both are from different castes. They accepted for this wedding only because... ...she's the sister of an MLA. So they were eyeing on her money part. But everyone in the family are casteists sir. His mother and wife keep fighting. His uncle Sundaracholan is the one who settles things between them. The reason for the issue to blow up like this is... ...because they insulted her by serving her in a separate plate for a month. Citing this as a reason... ...they were moved to the out house in the backyard. Sir! Hmm! Sir! Yeah, go ahead! At the beginning the uncle's behavior seemed right. His daughter has asked him... ...why she is being taken on a bike and not their car as usual. So he's promised to buy her a car before her birthday. He has tried to borrow some money for the same. He didn't get anywhere. Sundaracholan had sold his father's assets and kept the money for himself sir. Since it's his father's money, he decided to ask him. But he refused to give it and created a chaos there. And he's called his wife a filthy bitch. So he attacked him with a sickle and that's the mark you see on his forehead. He took an oath at that time sir. I'll fucking kill you. In a week, I will kill you with my own hands. That's why his wife is so sure... ...that he would've killed him. So you think his uncle would've killed him? Chances are there sir. I strongly feel he's the suspect sir. What type of a person was Senguttuvan? Senguttuvan didn't seem like a casteist sir. Sir, SP has come sir. OK, I'll call back. Sir! -What have you guys done? -Sorry sir! You go! OK sir! You should've refused to enquire unofficially right? Or if you had put in a word to me, I would've made them file a complaint. It's up to you now. In a week... I want to know who that accused is! Sure sir! Have you activated a CDR for that number? Activated a complete CDR sir. Not a single phone call in the last 10 days. The phone is switched off. We've been tracking down the call logs before that sir. Where is the signal showing up? Right in this village sir. Did you get the cell phone? Not yet sir! -Keep activating CDR for the number. -Sure sir, I'll do that. Hello! Who are you suspecting? His maternal uncle is the prime suspect sir. People believe that he would have done it because of the intercaste marriage. Do something. Sir! Form a team with Paridhi as the head. OK sir! Smash and hit anyone, I don't care! I want that accused. Sir! Why don't we have our Inspector as the head and... -Inspector is from their caste right? -Yes sir! Let Parithi take care of this. OK sir! Hey! Parithi! -Parithi, he's calling you. -Come here! Sir! Ask Parithi to take charge and look into Senguttuvan's case. Sir, what about that head thing? The head issue! I'll take care of it, it’s gone to the lab right? I'll get you a weeks’ time. Form another team and look into it. Look into this first, or we will all be displaced. OK sir! Listen! He's given me a weeks’ time. But I'll give you just 4 days. Finish it before that. Hey! Come! Since you're from the same caste, SP has ordered Parithi to take care of this. -You don't mistake me. -Sir! You be with him and finish the case. Sir! Just a minute. What's up Karuppu? Sir! His uncle’s name again. Last week his Scorpio car was spotted here sir. they say his Uncle was spotted with him sir. He's very much capable sir. Go and enquire completely. Hey! Give me your number. 63 85... 56 77 23. -Where are you from? -Omandur sir. Tell me akka! Revathi's mother got pissed and left the hospital. Not sure what the issue is. Not sure what to do, I've to go out as well. OK akka! You leave. I'll take care of it. Leaving Revathi alone is... You leave akka, I'll take care. Yes sir! Hey! Parithi! Where the hell have you gone? I've been searching for you all day. Hey! MLA has come. I’ve been searching for you everywhere. Where are you? Come here soon. Where are you? Huh? Sir! I haven't seen my new born baby yet sir. Oh no! You could've informed me no? OK OK! -You go and see your baby. -OK sir. I'll go to the hospital and be back in 30 minutes sir. That's OK. I'll take care. You see the baby and come tomorrow morning. OK sir! Yes! Thank you! Revathi! Sorry dear! Don't touch me. Hey cutie! Sorry dear! Sorry dear! Don't you dare touch her. Don't touch him! Sorry dear! Cutie pie! She looks just like you. Who said so? She looks absolutely like you. By the way, why did your mother leave angrily? Well! Well... -Cutieee! -Mom! Don't life her. Why what happened? Well... He'll come. You can lift her after he lifts her. Oh! So I'm not supposed to lift her until your man comes? Don't be kidding. You come to me cutie... I said DO NOT LIFT HER UP. I came here all the way for you. Hey! That's crazy! Anyways the Doctor and the nurses would've lifted her before I do. What if your mother lifts her in her hand? Why did you come here? Huh? Now that he has done it, it’s my turn to hold her. Ahh! Come to me baby! Come to me you cutie pie! I'll raise you baby! If only my parents had turned up to see the baby! Yeah! I know right! Look at your granny you cutie! Karuppu! Hello Karuppu? Hello sir! Yes, tell me Karuppu! Whatever we enquire about Senguttuvan, we end up closing in on his uncle. He's been quite a horny bull, I've asked to investigate in that angle as well. Even Sundaracholan doesn't seem to like him. Everyone around there... ...are so sure that his Uncle would've killed him. I've been having the same doubt sir. You do one thing. Go to his village and enquire about him and his uncle. Alright? OK? Yeah OK Karuppu! Yes OK! What's all this? It was an important call. Murugesan might be a boss in the town. But you're the boss in this station. We have been searching for him for two weeks. You nailed him down in a day, you're a legend. Sir! Sir... I swear I have no connection to this sir. Village President's son is the one behind all this sir. Those two are the ones who informed about the stock there sir. Huh? Sir! You and that Village President are going to pay for all this. Sir sir! -Fucking get up and sit you asshole. -I swear I'm innocent sir. -I said fucking get up. -Please leave me sir, I'm innocent. How dare you? Get up now. Sir, please sir! -Come on, get up and sit this side. -Please sir, leave me alone. Greetings sir! Sir! We arrested the hunter yesterday right? He's his father. Sir, they're blasting the shit out of my son. He's innocent sir. Oh God! I warned about the Police and asked him not to enter the forest. He never listened to me. -I'll surrender at your feet... -Hey! -Please ask them not to beat him. -Hey, send him off. Sit down now! Always cribbing. -Sir, I know nothing. -So you won't tell me. Huh? -Done enquiring those three. -OK! All the three are pointing this fellow. He's the on who spotted the dead body. What did you do? Sir! I did nothing. You can't question me like an accused. -Hey! -They both are fraudulent. They asked me where my father has hid the stuff. How dare they? That's why I detoured them. But I never expected the body to be in that place sir. Hey! How did you accurately know that place? Did you kill and bury him? Sir! Why would I kill him? He's a perverted asshole of the first order. He harassed a girl in the town and got slippered. He would've done the same to some women and the husband would've killed him. Don't randomly put the blame on me. Son! Wait Dad! Hey! -I did nothing wrong sir. -Hey Hey! Dickhead! Why are you so loud? What's wrong with you? How dare you raise your hand on him? Sir! I'll smash your hands. Sit down. Sit! Karuppu! I'll fucking thrash your mouth. You think this is some political party's office? I'll smash your brains. In this CDR of Sundaracholan... ...there is no record of any calls after 9 PM. But, look at this particular day. He's got a call at sharp 12 in the night. Check for this number. Which number is it Parithi? I'll check it right away sir. -This one. -Everyone in that village are my realtives. Tell me the number Karuppu. 741... 741... 843... 43 89... 43 43 89... Huh! Professor! Professor? Yes, he's the relative of Sundaracholan. He's our neighbor. Uh... But why has he called at late night? What about the Professor's family? Professor's wife is a homemaker. He has two daughters. First one is doing her college, and the other one is in high school. Uh...Karuppu! Get a CDR for the Professor's number. OK sir! Sir! Why would I kill him? He's a perverted asshole of the first order. He would've done the same to some women and the husband would've killed him. Don't randomly put the blame on me. -Everyone are pointing at the uncle. -Yes sir. Send it to me on WhatsApp. You did? Wait, let me call you back. Sir! We've got the CDR. The professor and the victim's uncle... ...have constantly been in touch sir. Otherwise the CDR is clean. But... One more thing sir. There is a one hour call, daily between his number and one other number. And there is something fishy about it sir. The other number is switched off for almost a week now sir. Since last week? Which day exactly? Monday sir! Monday? Sir! Senguttuvan died on Monday sir. That's what the post mortem report says. Sir! Sundaracholan called the Professor on Monday too. Sir! So, that's it... Sundaracholan and the Professor would've killed by hiring hitmen sir. I feel we need to close in and lock the Professor. -Sir, please don't hit me. -Tell me, tell me. Sir Sir, please don't hit me. Sir, please stop it, don't hit me. -Then tell me. -I know nothing sir. -Tell me, tell me now. -Sir, please don't hit me sir. Sit down properly, tell me now. -Its hurting sir, please don't hit me. -Tell me then. Please stop it sir, don't hit me sir. No sir! Hey, lock his legs. Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up, I don't want any screams. No screaming. Hey! You think you are a Don? Hiring henchmen to kill people? Who are they? Are you even a Professor? You've killed someone because of your fucking caste pride! Sir, I swear I didn't do it. -Sir, please! No. -How long? Tell me! Whose help did you take? Tell me. Tell me who. Tell me now, tell me right now. Tell me! How did you kill him? Tell me. Sir, please don't hit me, I didn't kill him. Sundaracholan has clearly said you did it. And here you're denying it. He is just blurting out stuff sir. That is not True. I swear I didn't do it sir. Hey! Bring the FIR here. Professor has admitted that he did it by taking his orders. He's just not accepting it, file the case. File the FIR. Sir, I never did it, I didn't kill anyone. Hey! Hey! Hey! Didn't he call you last Monday to inform you that he killed him? Sir! Which phone sir? Hey! At 12 in the midnight... ...why the fuck did you call Sundaracholan? Tell me! Tell me now. Tell me. Tell me, Tell me in detail right now. Tell me and remove your glasses. Remove our glasses you asshole. Tell me. Listen! Your phone doesn't get any call after 9 PM in the night. Last Monday he had called you to inform this. Sir...Sir! I did make the call sir. What did you say? But he's the one who gave a missed call sir. That's why I called him and asked him what it was about. I went to the restroom and when I came back my phone was near the pillow. I assumed it would've been some misdialed call... -...and left it there and slept off sir. -Hey! Sir, sir! OK, leave that aside. Who's number is that you frequently call and talk for hours? Sir! Who's number is that? There is a girl in my college sir. She's joined as a training lecturer. I got her a phone sir. She's a widow sir. This is her number sir. Then why the fuck did you buy that number in your name? That number has been switched off since Sengutuvan's murder. Sir, she was interested as well, that's why I got it. I was talking to her daily sir. One day when she found out that I love her.. What? Sir! As she found out I was in love... ...she returned the phone back to me sir. That's why the phone is switched off sir. Love! Idiot! Why the hell did you call me at 1 AM? Brother! I called you because you gave me a missed call. That's why I'm sitting here with you. Ahhh! Get lost man. They're not spilling anything despite beating the shit out of them. They say the same thing repeatedly. Even if we twist the questions, answers dont change right? I feel these two are innocent Parithi. I feel the same sir. Sir! SI Karikalan is waiting to meet you sir. What for? Some missing case. So he's come to meet you sir. OK, ask him to wait, I'll be there. Hey! Sir? Ask Kicha to get food for those two. OK sir! Go! Parithi! While you go deep into this case, Do not lose focus on the missing head. Head case is in control right? Of course sir. OK? Take care. OK sir! OK! Hello sir! Hello sir! Kicha! Sir? Get him tea. It’s OK sir, I'm going to have lunch now. What's wrong in having a single tea? So! Tell me sir. You sent a picture of a decomposed body right? Yes! A guy named Sivasangu is missing in my area. OK! He's been missing for 6 months. I came here 3 months back to enquire about him. We heard he had an affair with a woman here. We searched for her but she’s still missing. So we assumed he must have eloped with that woman. Hmmm! Later when we dug deep, we got to know that... ...he was filthy rich... ...and we suspect his wife could've killed him for that money sir. Also sir... This is that guy's photo. Sir tea! I saw the picture you sent. That's why I came here. Does the decomposed body resemble him? I'm not able to figure that out completely. Have you sent the head part for skull imposition? Well...we're yet to give sir. We are waiting for the same. I came all this way just for that. Please send me the report once you get that sketch sir. OK sir! Thank you sir. Thank you. Yes tell me sir. What's happening there? We're still investigating sir. But, I don't think his Uncle did it sir. Hey! What the hell are you talking? Everyone are naming him. MLA wants him in the jail. You stop stirring things up. Get 2 villagers as eye witness. Put him on remand. Lets deal with it later. -OK sir! -You get it? -Finish it off quickly. -I'll take care sir. OK sir! Sir Sir Sir Sir! Please don't hit me sir. We did it. -We're the ones who killed sir. -Please don't beat me sir. Yes sir, we only killed him. What are you saying? It was us who killed Senguttuvan. We both did it together sir. Go bring the Inspector. Please do not hit us, its very painful. Hey! Are you fucking kidding me? You've been denying since morning... ...suddenly you've turned the plates? Tell me now. How did you do it? Hey! He's asking you. Did you slash him or beat him to death? I said open your mouth. No sir! He held him sir. I'm the one who stabbed him sir. No sir, no sir. He held him and I threw a rock on his head and killed him sir. Sir! They're lying sir. Hey, tell me now. What the hell happened? I'll fucking thrash you to death. -Please don't hit us sir. -Hey! How did you do it? Please don't hit me sir. Tell me how you did it. We're not able to bear this thrashing, hence we accepted to the crime sir. Utthaman brother told me you will stop hitting us only if we accept. But you're still beating us sir. Hey! When did he tell you? In the afternoon when we were having lunch... Kicha and Utthaman told us sir. He asked us to accept the crime here and... ...asked us to deny the accusation in the court sir. -That's why we accepted to the crime. -Bloody! Hey Parithi, what's all this? Utthaman! Utthaman, come here. Yes Parithi, coming. Don't you have any sense? Huh? Whats the use of having so much experience? Huh? Don't you know what to tell the accused? Is this how you talk to an Accused? Learn Basic Police work first before working. -Well I told him... -Please shut and leave brother. Hey! Kicha! Hey! Come here. Come here. Bloody! You think you're a cop? -If I find you doing any... -Send him out of the station Karuppu. -Don't you dare step into this station. -Go, get lost. -Sir! -Get lost. Go now. Tell me your name. Father's name is SP Kumar. What? SP? Why are you telling his name? What's your name? Say it out Loud like that! I am fucking deaf. I can hardly hear anything. Karuppu! Sir! Come! Ask him what he wants. Tell me! Hmmm! Yes! OK hang up now. What now? 4 people spying his neighbour’s house. So he's trying to get our attention. He's consoling us this way for what he got from us in the morning. OK, come on, let's go and see what's wrong. Fucker! Get in. Get in! Fast! Sir! Go! -Sir! -Move! Sir! What's up Kicha? Are you angry? Angry with you? It was uthaman sir who told them the idea. But you screamed at me. He's elderly. Can't scold him. I know sir. Don't I know about you? Your daughter? Yes sir! What's your name dear? Revathi uncle. No! It’s OK, you can take it. No, my Dad will get me. You buy whatever your Dad doesn't buy you. No, my Dad buys me everything I ask for. Tell her Kicha. Take it dear. Take it. Have it. Thanks Uncle. Kicha! Daddy’s girl? Yes sir! She doesn't have a mother. By the way Kicha! We have roll call tomorrow. Can you come early and fill water? -OK sir. -OK! OK, I'll take leave, Bye dear. Roll Call. Attention! Roll Call! Stand at ease. Don't keep getting bribe. You read the newspapers right? They're savaging us. Government is giving you salary right? Then why is your hand itching for more money? Be careful from now. Finish it off. Roll call! Attention! Roll call - Stand at ease. Roll call - attention. Roll call - Fall out. -We need to put him inside and thrash him. -What to do! Hello! Tell me! Tell me the number. Sir! A sim card was inserted into Senguttuvan's phone two days back. This is the number. Constable! Constable! Sir? Check out the case details of this. Here, look into this first. OK sir! Sir! There is just a Section 110 case sir. Sankar! Sir! Take this. Check if there is any crime report on him. OK sir. Sir! Sir! Victim Senguttuvan's phone... ...Has a sim inserted in it in the name of Murugan. There is already a Section 110 case on him. I think we've almost closed in on the accused. I want that CDR immediately sir. Please get it for me sir, please. Umesh! Get me a cigarette. Karuppu! Check what this is about. OK sir! Sir! According to CDR, these 3 numbers have been frequently contacted sir. First number is in the name of a girl called Meenakshi. Comparing the ages of both, she could be his lover. Because all the calls are long calls. Calls from the second number are all shorter ones. It shows his house location. Maybe he could've given that number to his mother. Third number is the most important number sir. Its in the name of a guy called Pandi. If you compare the ages of both, they're not at all relatable. But the only key point in Pandi's number is... ...Pandi's location... ...which is Senguttuvan's village. The only connection between Murugan and Senguttuvan is... ...Pandi. Constable! Sir! -Call our source. -OK sir! Hello! Sir! Pal Pandi is not out of town sir. He's here in the village. He's right here in his house sir. Sir! Sir! Please come sir. Hmmm! Sir! Why did you kill Senguttuvan? Sir! Go! Hello sir! Give me your phone. Karuppu! Check this. It says "Mapla" sir. Call now. Ask him where he is! Buddy! Tell me buddy! Where are you Mapla? At home, why? What's up buddy? Tell me. Cut the call, right now. I'll call you right back. Where is he? Sir, he's at home. Where is it? Here? Close by sir, will reach now. Take this right brother. This side. Hey, come with me. Come on sir! This house sir. Sir, its locked. Call him now. Hey Muruga! Tell me buddy! Where are you? I'm at home buddy. I reached your house dude. What? You came here? OK, just come outside then. -Yes come out. -Sir, he's calling us out sir. -I'm right outside. -Come with me sir. Hey Muruga, I've come out. Turn and walk straight. -He's asking us to come straight. -Go. Come Parithi! I'm coming now. -You see the yellow house to your left? -Yes dude! -Come inside that. -Yes I'm coming. Hey, where is he? -You reached? -He's making us roam! Hey! Hey! Parithi, isn't this Kicha's house? Are you inside this yellow house? I'm inside only buddy, come in. -Where are you? -Ahh, come no? Hey Mapla! What are you doing here? What’s up buddy? Fucker! Getup now. Get up! What did I do sir? You think you're some fucking big shot? Made us roam and chilling her. -Fucking asshole. -What did I do sir? What the... Hey buddy! What is this? Why are they hitting me? Dad! Yes? Greetings sir. What's up Kicha? Is this your house? Yes sir! -What's up dear? Leaving for school? -Hmmm! -Yes uncle! -Very good. Dad, auto has come. What did I... Sir! -Get going -I didn't do anything sir. -Why are you taking me sir? -Shut up and come. Sir, please! Sir! -I said Go! -I did nothing sir. -Please leave me alone sir. -Get in. I said get inside. Sir, I did nothing sir. Sir...Sir... Brother! Huh? Parithi! How did he end up at Kicha's house? That's what is puzzling for me as well. Check what's happening. Sure Parithi! Dad, bye-bye! Hey Kicha! Sir! Why is he inside your house? What's happening between you both? He comes here rarely sir. At night times, he drinks and sleeps off here. Hey, tell me the truth. Its getting bigger day by day. He comes here and drinks... -Aye! -Nothing other than that. I'll slap you. Give me your phone. Sir! Give me your other phone as well. -No sir, I don't... -Don't you dare lie to me. -Give me your other phone. -I swear I don't have it sir. Listen! Sir! Parithi! You won't be able to bear what I do to you. He knows Kicha from our station only. So he visits him often. He doesn't know good or bad. Myself, or him or even you, if any of us get him alcohol, he will drink. After his wife's death, he keeps calling someone or the other home and... ...drinks and chills at his place. Nothing other than that. -I know nothing sir, please listen to me. -Karuppu! Give me that phone. Hey! You've put this sim in some other phone and used it. Where is that phone? Another phone... Bloody answer him quickly. Did you put this sim in any other phone? Sir! What are you stammering for? Tell me. Sir that is Kicha's phone sir. Hey, they're asking for your phone only. Huh? I don't have any phone sir. Hey! Other day when I came home, a sim was inserted in your phone no? You snatched away saying its your daughter's phone. That's what they're asking for. Sir, he's lying sir. Stop lying to me. Sir, I swear he's lying. -Don't divert us away. -Hey, don't lie Kicha. Sir, it’s in his house, please search for it sir. Karuppu! go ahead. Go and have a look sir. He kept it in the shelf in his house sir. Sir, why are you taking me in? Sir! Sir! Where is it? Sir! He had it here sir. I don't have any phone sir. Parithi, don't listen to him... Hey! I'm going to smash you. Where is it? Sir, he had it here sir. That's not my phone sir. Sir, I swear it’s not mine. Believe me sir, it’s not mine. Open your mouth, bloody! Tell me, tell me now! Give me a name you asshole. Tell me! Who's phone is that? Speak up you idiot, who's phone is it? Fucking thrash him, bloody! Open your mouth you moron! I'll fucking thrash you! You better tell me before i show you hell. Hold him up, lock him by his knees. This will go on if you don't give me a name. Break his fucking knee. Here, have some food. Hey, Karuppu Better stop this. I am just giving him food. Hey! Have this food. Hey! You think he doesn't know why you're giving him this? Poor fellow! What's wrong in him eating brother? What's wrong with you brother? Hey! Eat this. Have it. Hey! Listen to me. Karuppu -Eating happily? - Sir! -Sir! -Get up you moron! Get up and tell me! -Hey! Karuppu! Please stop it. -Speak up you moron! He's innocent. -Tell me right now! -Please don't hit me sir! Where did you get it from? Tell me! -Tell me right now! -Please don't hit me sir! Parithi! The other guy is the cheater. That's Murugan's phone. He's trying to frame Kichha so that he can escape. Karuppu is beating him black and blue. Parithi! [SCREAMS] Please come no? Sir! Sir! Whose phone is that? Look at him! -God! It’s painful! -Where did you get that from? -Speak up! -Sir I did nothing sir. He's so inhuman. Who's phone is that? Who's phone is that? How did you get it? Speak up! Open your mouth! Tell me, tell me right now! -Sir Sir someone save me sir! -Who's phone is that? Where did you get it? -Tell me! -Sir! Hey! Speak up now you asshole! Who's phone is that? How did you get it? Karuppu, Karuppu! Enough stop it. -Fucking asshole! -Stop it Karuppu! He's not uttering a word sir. - Get up -Get up! -Get up! Get up now! Come come! Nothing to worry, it’s all over! -Fucking asshole! -Hey Karuppu enough! Stop it. This asshole is lying sir. Fucking cunt! Calm down buddy! Come on! Listen up Kichha! Listen! Tell me the truth! He won't lay his hand on you, tell me! Hey! Listen! The Inspector is clueless about how to finish this case. He will frame you in a flash. Unless you speak up I cannot help you. Huh? Stop crying. Kichha That's my phone sir. What? That's my phone sir. Really? What are you saying? You never had a phone. Huh? Bought it from someone Sir. Bought it? From whom? Bought from someone at the wine shop. From which wine shop did you get it? Where? He was drinking right here. What did he look like? He was wheatish. Should be as tall as me. Hey you! Sir What can I get you? Last Monday... ...did you notice someone drinking at this table? Sir! Hundreds of people come and go, how do you expect me to remember? It’s not my job to note down who is coming and going. What's that fucking arrogant attitude while answering? Answer properly. I swear, I know nothing sir. Hey! A guy was drinking from morning till evening right? That was last Monday don't you remember? He picked up a fight with you right? I paid for him! Remember now? Hey you! Come here! Where's the side dish? Oh yes! Now I recall. A man was drinking from dawn to dusk. He's the one who bought him alcohol. He didn't even order for a side dish. I recall now after seeing him. Sorry sir! I instantly couldn't recollect. Didn't I tell you sir? I got the phone from him! Hey Parithi! Sir Fine come on let's go. What is he saying? Sir! Last week someone was drinking here sir. Kichha had bought the phone from him. This guy has seen him as well. -Yes sir, he did drink a lot. Hey! Tell me the truth! Otherwise... Hey! Make him understand. Listen! I swear it’s not my phone sir. You asked me right? My daughter... After she saw an Advertisement on TV... ...She has been asking for that phone for a while sir. Incidentally, he was short on money for drinking and had the same phone sir. So I took it from him. Or else I wouldn't have got it sir. Hey! Then why did you deny it when I asked first? Only after you came did I know that... ...it was a stolen phone. I was too scared to disclose. Stolen phone? That's Senguttuvan's phone. Huh? I swear I didn’t know that sir If I had known I would not have taken it. This is adding up to the mess. If you need something why don't you ask me? Parithi! Come here! Just a second sir. Sir! What's he saying? He's saying the truth sir. He has taken the phone from a guy here. That drunkard is the accused sir. If we track him down things will come to light. Does this place have a CCTV? Does it? This place doesn't have CCTV sir. The ATM on the opposite side has one. OK Paridhi! Ask Uthaman to check what it is. And enquire Kichha as well. OK sir! Hey! Sir! Why do you have to whip him so badly? -Thought he is the accused. -You will never reform. Lashing our own! Get lost! Give me the phone number 99 76 76... Say it loud you dickhead. -Say it. -99 76 76... Go! Keep walking! -Going to whip you raw! -Forward a bit Stop just here. Look at those three guys. See! -Is it them? -No sir, not them. Hmmm! Forward further. Look at the one with helmet. Look there! Is he the one? -No sir, not him. -Uthaman brother! Yes? What's happening? Give me a minute. Play the next clip. That was the last clip. We have seen all the clips. He couldn't spot him. How do we go about it Parithi? OK, let me go home and come back in the morning. Ok Hey Kichha! Look properly one more time. Oh God! Come let's take a look again. Greetings sir. -Hello sir! -Good Morning. Karuppu, what does that old man want? I don’t know. He comes every morning. Could you recover anything from those guys? None of them are opening up. They claim no recovery and it’s new. I am tired of trashing them. OK, ask them all to come out. OK Sir! Come out, come! Go lean against the wall. Go! Make it fast! Go go! Out! Go stand against the wall. Stand in a row now. Stretch your hands. Stretch them I say! Stretch it, stretch properly. Stretch it straight come on! Sir Sir its hurting sir. I don’t know anything sir! Please let me go sir. Sir Sir its hurting sir, please. It’s hurting badly. Didn't it hurt while stealing? Sir Sir Sir! Ayya (Your Highness) Ayya.. Ayya.. I am not aware of anything sir. I am no way connected sir. Hold up straight. -Its hurting sir. -Stand up straight! Karuppu he is the one. Get in all of you. -You wait here! Rest of you get in. -Sir Sir, please sir. Go get in. Run! Sit down. Sit down you! Sit! Stretch your legs. Keep both the legs together. Brother, clutch him. -I didn't do anything sir. -Bring the bucket, Shut up! Bring the bucket. Please leave me sir, please please! No sir, please! Sir sir please leave me Speak up! Speak up! Please leave me alone sir, please! Sir sir no sir! Don't break my bones sir please! Sir sir no sir please leave me. Leave me sir! Leave me sir! Don't break my bones sir please! Do not break my bones sir! I'll tell you the truth sir. I'll accept it sir, please! Shall give recovery sir, I am the one. Shall give recovery sir! - Sir sir! - Get up! Spit it out you moron! Where have you concealed it? It’s in the pawn shop sir. I’m looking for a ring… Show him! Ya Karuppu! Ask him to call. Hello Yeah! That's right! What? You're coming to the shop? Now? Ok come over! Listen, do something. Turn that CCTV off. I didn't do anything sir Please let me go sir! I am innocent sir! Hey sit aside! Hey! What's this? What you do is a fraud business. Your association is repeatedly calling me. If they call me again... -Will tear off your fibular nerves! -Sir sir! - Will thrash you - Thrash him sir This is the complete missing list sir. Hey Pazhani stop lashing. Might die getting lashed. -Please don't call them Brother. I’m trying to compromise, please… - Hey! -Sir! Come here Do their identities and age match? Nothing seems to match sir! -Pin these on the board -OK sir. Place the file there. Hey Kichha bring the pins. Tell me I know nothing sir, my brother takes care of everything. -Uthaman brother! -Yes! Bro Uthaman! Just a second. Hand me the phone numbers of all the accused. I don’t know anything sir, my brother deals with all this. What's it about the dealing? Please ask Ganesan to come and... Check if anything belongs to them from the recovered jewels. -I'll call and inform. -Take him! Come get all the jewels to my table. So you're the one who's holding all the jewelry. Tell me! Are you running a jewelry shop or a stolen goods shop? What's up Sir? He'll keep talking something. Let it go. Looks like when you are not around chairs here go missing. Huh? Chairs are not to be found when you are not around. Sir! What's all this? Seems you went overboard the other day. No one is a casteist in this station. You better understand that. Hey Uthaman! Check if any of their jewels match from the recovery. Checking on the same sir. Please learn to respect people sir. We are humans too. We are here to serve you. What's happening? None of the jewels match sir. These are some other stolen jewelry. None of it is matching sir... Please leave if there's any recovery I shall intimate. My daughter's wedding is due sir! Please try and help us sir. What do you expect me to do sir? Ask your lawyer. He is the one advocating law right? If we do not file a FIR know the reason behind... You should understand it. We are here to file an FIR right? Even if the jewelry is traced it will take two years to reach you. Would you be willing to postpone your girl's wedding for two years? Ask him sir. Check with your lawyer. Kindly check if you can get something from the recovery… Oh really? Does your law accommodate such things? Even If we do that for you... ...you’ll say “these cops are the ones who stole the jewels" …and now they’ll ask for a commission.” I can't help you with this. Go check with Parithi about what can be done. Sir Sir! -Please get it for me sir. -Come come, Heard what he said right? Please get it back sir! Sir Welcome, have a seat. We are yet to trace the ones who robbed your jewelry. You say your girl's wedding is scheduled next month Yes sir! I discussed with the inspector. Have arrested four guys who robbed some other place. -OK Sir! -Will anyhow recover from them. Say if we recover thirty sovereigns... OK! Your FIR says forty sovereigns. Yes sir! If you arrange twenty sovereigns... I'll close the FIR claiming forty sovereigns are recovered. Can you arrange twenty sovereigns? No sir! I am completely helpless, please help me sir. That is all we had sir. Lost everything sir. You please wait I'll talk to the inspector and get back. What did he say? He said he will talk it through to the inspector and get back. What's your lawyer buddy saying? He never came in. He sent in Ganesan and moved away. Of course! That’s what he would do. Loads of self pride. Fine! What do we do? Sir! I feel bad for Ganesan. His daughter is getting married next month. Can we do something? Uh... We can script it saying "it was told 40 sovereigns out of anxiety... ...we can change the FIR and... ...I'll maybe get a recovery from the pawn guy. Fine! You close the issue. Let it be off the record. People will say I favored my caste men. Awaiting to prey on it. Do you get it? OK Sir I won't say that. I'll discuss with them and... ...pretend like I'm asking this in front of them. As in, "if we can do this sir?" You just nod your head and I'll take care of the rest. OK, you take care of everything. Yes OK sir. Uthaman brother! Yes? Get 25 sovereigns of recovery from the pawn guy. I'll get it right away. Uh...Madam! Give this to sir, everything is pre filled. -Sing it and get it. -Uh Madam! Tell me sir. In Ganesan's crime case. We've mentioned 40 sovereigns in the FIR right? Yes! Change that to 25 sovereigns and... ...get it signed from Ganesan. OK sir! -Uthaman will bring the jewelry, see to it. -OK sir! Uh... Constable! That pawn broker's brother... Yes! He has jewelry weighing machine in his car. Take him and get that. Hey come with me. Ganesan brother... Advocate sir... Both of you please come in. I've spoken to the pawn broker about the recovery. He's promised a recovery of 25 sovereigns. Ganesan Brother. You do one thing. Get this 25 sovereigns and start your wedding works. When the case comes to the court... -Sir, Pawn broker's brother. -Give me the 25 sovereigns. Get back the 25 sovereigns through the court. You should give the guarantee, OK? Sir, I've spoken to the pawn broker for 25 sovereigns of recovery. -I've decided to give that to them. -OK give it. Yes OK sir. Parithi! We got the jewelry. - He’s in a lot of pain Shall I let him go? OK send him, shall return the remaining jewels to his brother. Which ones should we keep aside sir? Whichever jewelry is important for the wedding... ...of about twenty five sovereigns. Set aside. Hey! It’s all 916 right? Yes sir, absolutely. Bring the remaining. OK brother. Weigh it properly. This weighs a little extra sir. -Remove the dollar. -OK sir. Sir! Sir Senguttuvan's brother is here to meet you. -Make him wait in my room, I'll be there. -OK sir! Sort this out -Bro please stay along and take care of it. -Yes OK! Hello! Your brother's reports are here. Here! Here you go. -Write your address and sign. -OK sir! What happened sir? Sir, this is my brother's chain. Hey stop that pawn broker. Do not beat me sir. Leave me sir leave me. Stop thrashing me sir. Hey! Be clear, did your brother pawn the chain? We aren't in that bad state. That's our ancestral chain Couldn't find it when my brother died Yes Karuppu FIR too reads chain is missing. Hey you! -I want everyone on the list. -Don't leave him Karuppu. Sir! Please sir! Sir! Kneel down and sit. Tell me, who pawned it? Who's that? Tell me now, who pawned it? Who is it? Tell me. Tell me, open your mouth. I'll thrash you. No point thrashing those loafers all night. Not one of them admitted to the crime. May be it is not them. I did enquire in all possible ways. None of them are opening up. Not sure where this case is heading towards. I'm not sure who pledged that chain to me. I disclosed the numbers of all the fraudsters. Still I am being thrashed. I have nothing more to reveal. Hey Kichha! Didn't you Pledge a chain with me? What's wrong with you? Gone nuts because of the thrashing is it? You might be right. They’ve hit me so much. I can’t differentiate good from bad. My head is messed up. I'll get to that pawn broker, you go and handle Kichha. Parithi, what happened? Madam... Kichha! Sir! This table is shaky, try to fix it. I'll get the hammer sir. Hammer? Uthaman brother! Kichha wants a hammer, please bring. You sit down. Been shaking badly for a week now. -Here it is Kichha, use it. -Take a look into it. Not much of a shake sir. Set it right. I know, you do it. Hey! Please speak up clearly. He must have come to your shop. Think over and tell me. No sir. No! He has definitely come to your shop and you guys have met. You are telling the truth. He is lying. Think it over, think properly. He has visited your shop for sure. Think and let me know. Think it over again. Think. Yes sir. When was it? It was a no moon day. How do you say that? Sir! We had offered prayers and broke the pumpkin sir. Isn't this Kichha? It is him sir. If you did not go who is in this video? How did you get the chain? I found it on the street sir. What? Found this too on the street sir. This too? Don't lie! You are lying. Do you think we are all fools? Open up and spit out the truth. Sir! After trashing and questioning him... ...got to know his dad isn't with him... He went missing three years ago. He was here to lodge the missing complaint about his dad. He stayed back with use and deceived all of us. He had his mom and a brother. His brother fell in love with a girl and brought her home. Died the day before the wedding in an accident. Kichha married that girl. They had a girl baby. That girl's name is Revathy studying Class 3. Seems like his wife looks pretty. Often there used to be rift at home due to that. She ran off even before his dad could go missing. Enquired about him around his place. Everyone vouches him to be squeaky clean. No charges against him as well. Seems like he has connections with his wife's sister. It's in the air that his wife ran off because of that. He calls it Love sir, bloody asshole. His sister in law is in Srirangam. Should take her into custody sir. Hold up hold up. Why wouldn't you get out when your family is around? You fucking asshole. Why are you not coming out? Come out. -Get up and come outside! -Sir! What happened Karuppu? Why is he not coming? Sir his child is waiting outside. That's why he's refusing to come. Get up and come outside, Sir has come. Stand up on your feet now. Hey! I'll fucking not spare you. Wait and see. -Can you all wait inside? -OK sir. Get inside dear. -Sir! -What's it Parithi? Did he tell you anything? He's not coming out since his daughter is here. We can do something with that. Come out. Sir they will heed to your words sir. There's not anyone for me but you sir. Hey don't you know about the Inspector? He'll never listen to me. He will listen to you sir, please help me. Hey Paridhi. No use talking him Parithi Whole family has come right? Book his sister in law under brothel case. Book his mom for selling weed. Send his daughter to Juvenile, charging theft. Sir sir please don't do it sir. Make him stand half nude in front of his daughter so that he spits out the truth. Hey, bring his daughter. What? He's ready to tell the truth sir. Hey, get up and speak up the truth now. -Sir will not hurt you. -Stand up man! -Speak up! -Sir he will tell now. Doesn't matter Kichha came for some important work. That's ok come on, been long since we met. Your brother in law is a MLA but never turns up to his constituency. Good that you came come, have some tea. -Come on Have a seat. -That's OK. -Its OK, I’ll come some other… -Have a seat. It’s not a big house like yours.

He is lying. Uthama... Come here. Show him that phone recording. Just a second. Sir Three or four? Think through and tell me. I need to write the FIR. Let's get in to a middle ground. I won't change after this. Sivasangu, Sangilipandi, Murugesan, Periyamaari. Veeraiyan, Mahendran, Maharajan, Senguttuvan. A total of 8 people sir. What do you have to say now? They kept hitting me sir. But once I told them I murdered, they stopped hitting me. They even bought me Biriyani. They even respected me. I have no connection with these crimes. Everyone here are trying to frame me. You are my only hope. Save me. How are you listing out the right names then? I know their names well. Sivasangu, Sangilipandi... Murugesan, Periyamaari... Veeraiyan, Mahendran... Maharajan, Senguttuvan. I was the one who pinned their pictures on the board. Ask them. It is on the notice board. You can even check. All of us here know these names. I am going to kill you. What is all this? You honest Cop! How much bribe did you take? You took bribe and let my husband's killer go. And now who have you framed someone instead? Did you let him free because he is from your caste? -Come -Tell me. Let me talk. Trying to finish the case? -You come. -Let me go. What is all this? What is happening here? I am sure he is the culprit. Do you have evidence? We have the phone recording right? Throw that in the garbage. I don't care what you do! Need proper evidence. Get that straight. He is leaving in extreme anger. What else do we do? This is taxing. Go break his limbs at once. Do not spare him. Sir Sir! Kicha suddenly told that he lied about committing murders. He told the ADSP. ADSP is angry now. What are you saying? To add to this, Senguttuvan's wife... ...yelled accusing us of taking bribe to let go of the uncle and... ...framing someone else instead. ADSP stormed out of the station. Let us go to the station. Karuppa! Throw some light on who the accused is. I shall sacrifice a goat. Let us go. Let us hurry. -Oh god. -Hey! Careful. Careful. Can't you see clearly in day light too? Yes sir. Looks like I have a problem with my sight. The catch I developed in the forest that night is still there. Sir. What happened? -What are you looking? -Constable! Do you have the picture of Senguttuvan's body? -Yes sir. -Show me. Kicha didn't stop with eight. The count is 9. What are you saying? If it was Kicha who killed Senguttuvan, this one too is done by him. The head is with Kicha. He is claiming to be innocent. But you are claiming he did 9. Sir. He has buried Senguttuvan's body just 1 feet under. The depth of grave that was dug next to the body in the forest is 1 feet. To summarize, the missing head must be with Kicha. Check this picture. Oh! You lost the head? After losing the head of the corpse... ...and hiding the fact that it was lost.... ...SI Parithi from Vembur Police station has been temporarily suspended. The government officers and Police officers who supported him... ...are also subjected to strict action. Tell me sir. What is the update on Kicha case? Nothing! He is playing smart. Not able to get him to talk. I am clueless sir. Lab technician and the doctor who helped us are suspended too. DSP was here all this while. He is furious. Okay sir. Inspector is here. I'll call you back. How do we make him talk? Shall we adopt Parithi's strategy? We can... ...but it might be risky. What risk? Call him. Hey! Bring him here. You... Go buy me some tea. Go! Hey! Wipe your tears and go. Hey! Sir he is running away. Go get him. Run! Get him. Quick. Hey! Uthaman sir. Kicha is running away. Where did you miss it? Get him. Kicha stop! -Kicha. -Kicha listen. How dare you try to escape? Fucker! Trying to escape when there are so many of us? -How did he come out? -DSP sent him to buy tea. But he tried to escape. Bloody Fucker! If Parithi asks for tea, you go get it. But if I ask for it, you run away? Sir! What? You know everyone here. He's been here for 3 years. You either rip him off, or investigate in your style. You can't get anything from him. Sir! There is only one way out. What is it? Parithi sir. Ask him to come down. -Mam please charge this. -Greetings Sir. Where's he? He is inside sir. Hey Karuppu! -Karuppu! -Sir? -Hold on sir I shall untie. -Hey Karuppu! Have you lost your mind? Why did you thrash him so badly? So inhuman you are. Thrashed him as if he is an animal. Untie him now. Where is his dress? -Will get it sir. -Bring it. So rude of you guys. Heartless fellows. Get up Kicha! Get up! Get up you! Slowly slowly. Get up! Get up slowly! Hey! Give him his dress. Here! Dress up. Unfold it. Sir give it to me sir. Wear this. Here! Slowly be careful. Give it to me. Here put this on. Give me my phone Madam! Sir, be careful sir. Hop on Kicha. Slowly! Be careful. -Shall we go? -Yeah! Rub it. Give this after food. What food can he have sir? No restrictions. Have it Kicha! Did you speak to Revathy? No sir! -Kicha! -Sir! Go meet your daughter and... ...tell her you are going out of town. Why don't you come with me sir? Well, I feel a little uneasy from my lunch. I will go have a soda. You take your time. Go! -Hey Kicha! -Sir? Take this. I bought this Briyani for your daughter. Hand it to her and bid good bye to her. Hello sir! Hey! Where are you? I'm in a shop near Kicha's place. Where's he? Inside his house sir. Inside the house? Where are you? Waiting at the corner of the street sir. What are you saying? See that he doesn't run off. Sir! We have taken enough care of him sir. If he gets outside and awaits me... ...making him talk will be a cake walk. If he tries to run away thinking I am gone... ...no one can make him reveal. Sir Sir! He is coming sir. Just a minute sir. Hold on sir. Sir! He is waiting for me sir. Uhhh do whatever! What Kicha? Did you deliver the food? Shall we move? -Yes sir! -Hop on! Did you see her Kicha? Saw her sir. What did you say? Did you ask her to study well Why didn't you come sir? Where to? What if i had ran away? I knew you will not run away. Kicha! I have a daughter now. Did you see her? Saw her sir! When I went to give food. My daughter... Her smile is so beautiful. I feel like holding her forever in my arms... ...and keep looking at her. Her tender fragrance still lingers. This is how Kicha... ...when I was a child... ...my dad used to be so fond of me. He would drop me at school. Myself... ...our little lambs... ... and my dad. All three of us... ...would drop our heads down and head to school. After dropping me at school... ...my dad used to graze the sheep till I finish my school. On way back home from school... ...my dad used to bend down and keep looking at me. And then I grew up... Still three of us would go... ...they both used to drop their heads and walk. I looked at the sheep to find that it had a rope around it's neck and legs. So it had to bend down. But why did my dad put his head down? Back then i didn't get it. That is why i studied hard. Studied with vigor. Understood the world. Became a SI. That's when my dad held his head high. Likewise my daughter... ...I want to look up to her. To get there.. I need to give her good education. That's the reason why... ...this job is so crucial to me. This is not just mine. My dad My mom My spouse And my kid It is vital to all of us. I am under suspension I have done a lot of bad things sir... Unknowingly... Commited many mistakes. This town... ...is filled with scumbags. Not a single soul is good "Kicha Kicha" I felt like a slave when someone calls me. The treat me like a servant sir. Make me do all odd jobs. Make me run from post to pillar. Others will be paid 500/- They would value me only for 200/- Because I am a fool. Kicha will not demand. Or will not react. That's how much I was taken for granted. My brother... ...wanted to marry a girl. All of us were inclined to get him married. The elder one... ...is still to be married. No one cared about it. Who will get their daughter married to Kicha? Lent some money from around... ...and arranged his wedding sir. Unfortunate bugger... ...the day before his wedding... ...he got killed in an accident. She eloped from her family just for him. We couldn't send her back. The way I suffered... She too was in pain and tears. I asked her... ...if she would marry me. She said "Yes" sir. The life we started... ...went on well sir. I was blessed with... ...a baby girl. Her name is Revathy. You did meet her the other day sir. The whole world looked down on me... ...she looked at me like I'm her world sir. I thought I'll have a happy life with my family. What are you hiding? Nothing! What's it? Mind your own business. -You are hiding something. -Didn't I say no? I know you are hiding from me. Yes. It's the phone. Where did you get it from? -I bought it. -Who gave you money? It's from my money. Where did you get the money from? It's from my earnings, what bothers you? Did you sleep with someone for money? Mind your tongue you asshole. I didn't sleep with anyone I just tricked. Tricked all those who wanted to sleep with me. Wanted to earn a living from a decent job. But you men never made me feel safe at work. Huh? From the age of thirteen years till today... Everybody wanted to sleep with me. She hoaxed everyone... ...and gave me reasons she considered valid. Understood she too sufferred like me. So... I joined hands with her. Because... This planet earth is so distasteful. Come on having come this far... -No! -It's ok come on! Come in my wife makes awesome tea. You must try it. Selvi Selvi Selvi He works in MHL dear. Dear make a tea for him. Kicha, please have this. Please forgive me Kicha. Don't leak this out please. We cheated and got money from everyone who lusted on her. But one day... Oh my god! Selvi! Selvi! Selvi dear? She left me and the kid... ...and got away with the one she liked. I was so helpless. The child to whom I meant the world... ...I couldn't feed her. Because no one will offer me a job. I started borrowing money from everybody. Woudn't have bothered if they refused to give money. Will show off with gold jewellery all over... ...they would pretend to be bankrupt. I will feel like smashing their head. Likewise everyone is destined to be rewarded a treasure don't you know? -Is it so? -Yes! How to get it? There's so much of hidden treasure here. Do you know Subramani? -Yeah! -How did he afford such a massive house? Not sure! Do you think he earned it all from the market? -Yeah, how is that possible? -He got a treasure while building the house. -Yeah! -That's how he built so many houses. -Is it? Lots more is hidden. Only one person ought to unearth it. What are you saying? Who is that? The one born in midhuna raasi and thiruvathirai star. Will win over the treasure. That's my sign as well. That's my sign brother. I know that's why I disclosed it to you. On a full moon day... ...at midnight 12 O clock... ...wholeheartedly... ...blindfold with a red cloth and... "Karuppaa where is the treasure?" "Karuppaa where is the treasure?" If you ask "Karuppaa where is the treasure?" In the seventh minute... Karuppu will disclose it in your ears. Karuppaa where is the treasure? Karuppaa where is the treasure? Karuppaa where is the treasure? It is a 50-50 share once you get it. What do you say? OK! OK! I took the chain and the ring from them sir. It just happened like that sir. That turned out to be a regular affair. One minute Kicha! Yes sir? Where are you? Uh... I'm on the way sir. Is the accused with you? Yes sir. Hey! I've suspended you right? Why the fuck are you roaming around with the accused? Be here in five minutes. Or else I will file a FIR on you as well. Sir sir! What happened Karuppu? Kicha's enquiry audio got leaked sir. How Karuppu? No clue sir. I am not at fault Karuppu. Sir, I know you didn't do it. The press is waiting right outside sir. Sir! SP just left. DSP is so furious. Please bring Kicha along... And sneak into the station sir. The good thing is.... No one can identify Kicha, so get here soon. Hey Kicha! Will you reveal who's the psycho killer inside I'll buy you a drink. Sir! Greetings sir. Why is it so crowded sir? Forget it. Did he confess? He confessed sir. Any evidence? Revealed about four places sir. What the hell is wrong with your phone? How did it leak from your phone? See the crowd gathered. I've no idea sir. How did it leak from my phone? Who the hell did this? If I get hold of him... I'll feed him to dogs. Hey! So you did it? How do we take him in this crowd, get evidence and remand him? Tell me! Tell me something. Sir! While I was bringing Kicha... No one could identify that he is the accused. When you leave, a few will follow you. Once the inspetor leaves rest of them will leave too. After that I'll take Kicha and drop him in my bike. Fine then... You take the inspector along and leave. Why are you keeping a long face? Well sir... Once we remand him, I'm not sure how to enquire about the missing head sir. I am suspended. This job is so vital to me sir. Let me have him for two more days sir. I shall find where the head is. So that I can safeguard my job. Just this night. Tomorrow morning I will get him under your custody. Trust me and do not worry carry on. See you! Sir! Can I please have a smoke? Yeah Sir! It's not here sir. Hey! You exactly know where the bodies are buried. Tell me! Didn't they thrash me like hell? Let them hunt sir. Hey! It's getting late! Just let me alone know. I'll tell you alone. Keep it to yourself sir. Tell it out after ten minutes. Tell me! It is right under us sir. Karuppu! Who is this It's our Veeraiyan sir. How come there is only one leg? I dispatched him in rainy season sir. Buried in the night and found a leg to be out the next morning. Puzzled as to what to do. So... Chopped off that leg and threw it in Kallanai. Come on sir, let's go. Hello sir! Hey Parithi what's up? We just found the first corpse. Moving on to next sir. It's getting late Parithi. Press is just behind me circling like an eagle. Where's the next one? Spit it out. Do not waste time. Speak up. Tell me! Tell me now. Sir tell him to stop hitting me. Karuppu! Stop thrashing him Karuppu! He will spot the next place himself. You're complaining? Open up! Tell it out you asshole. He is running away sir. Hey stop. Hey Kicha! Hey! Hey Kicha hey! You have no way out Kicha stop there. Hey stop! Hey! -Catch hold of him. -Hey stop there. Here it is sir. This is Sangilipandi's. Come on sir take it. What Karuppu? You thrash Kicha and he rushes to bring the slipper...What's up with it?! Hey Parithi! Why is it taking so long? Come soon. Hey! Don't keep digging deep to safeguard your job. Judge is yelling at me. No accused has ever given the true story after letting them out. Huh? They're pro at it now. I do understand, but what to do? Its all over the newspaper. Certainly we have to remand him. Sir! M C is here sir. Do you come forth to be guilty or did they make you to? No madam! I accepted it by myself. When would you want him under custody? Tomorrow morning? Yes Madam! Hey Parithi! Don't worry about anything. I spoke to the jailer, give him money in a black bag. He'll give it. They won't allow to talk in the night. We'll take him under custody early in the morning. OK? Sir! Sir! I'll call you back mom. I'll surely call back. Hey! What are you doing without sleeping? -Sleep off! -Sleep now. You are a crazy man. They have tactically handled you... ...made you confess, put you behind the bars. You believed him to be a noble man. Opened up entirely and landed up here. You are an idiot. Do you think they tricked me? Huh? Then what? When I came to the station one day... Uthaman sir was glancing through the newspaper. A headless corpse was found on the banks of river Cauvery. When the head goes missing even if the murderer walks in person... ...we cannot file a case. When the head goes missing... ...case cannot be filed was a news to me. Because of my error... ...the fear of getting caught was in me. I had buried someone few days ago. Why not dug up again and chop the head off? But... ...that was the only blunder I did. I dug up his body and was chopping his head. That's when Chockalingam sir was there on patrolling. Who is it? I was scared I would get caught and ran away from there. I started panicking so badly. I was thinking what to do. I thought I'll go to the station and check in the morning. People in the station knew nothing about it. So I decided to chop off the head and... ...I was about to leave. But they kept giving me chores at the station. When I got done with my work and went ahead to behead... ...the Police had arrived before me. When DSP instructed to drive the crowd away... ...they cleared everyone from there, except me. Since I was one of them. I looked around. ...I ensured no one noticed me. I felt like someone was chasing me from behind. I ran into the forest as a dog started chasing me. I slipped from the cycle and left the head behind and ran off. Head was somewhere... ...and the body was somewhere else. That made me restless. I went back to the stop to grab the head. Police were there. That's when Parithi sir found a light in the forest. I took advantage of it. I confused them more... ...by saying Olaiyur people use such lights. Thus taking them off course. But unfortunately... Police got the corpse of Senguttuvan which I buried. I still managed use the rift between Senguttuvan and his uncle... ...floated rumours about his uncle killing him. Sir! Looks like its his uncle. Looks like Scorpio car was here last week. But the Police enquired Senguttuvan's brother in law and the Professor... ...because of which I thought I escaped. But SI Karikalan... ...came in search of another person I killed. Just before the new issue escalated... ...I had to close Senguttuvan's case. So I provoked Uthaman sir. We made Senguttuvan's brother in law and the Professor confess saying... ...they only killed them. But they couldn't withstand the beatings and... ...they revealed our names to the Inspector. Out of anger, Parithi sir... ...shut me and Uthaman sir out. After getting out of the station... What's happening there... ....what to do next? I didn't have a clue. Karuppu! At the same time... The four guys who tried to rob our neighbourhood... I Looped them in. What Kicha? Are you angry? Not at all sir. Parithi sir trusted my pretence... ...and asked me to come to the station the next day. I thought everything was over. But we got a call at the station the very next day. Hello! They traced Murugan through that call and came to my home. They even found the phone I had. I lied to have bought it from someone. But I was sure of not getting caught this time. Because... I already killed the one I told that I took the phone from. But... ...those petty thieves I tricked... Ended up being a pain in my ass. They pulled in the pawn broker, promising to give recovery. It's with the Pawn shop sir. Senguttuvan's jewellery happened to be in recovery lot. Pawn guy got me trapped. Once I got pinned down... I cooked up a story for killing Senguttuvan. They bought it Being in the station for so long... ...won't I know what a FIR is? Be it I confess guilty of one murder or... ...or any number of murders for that fact. I will be imprisoned. If I am jailed... ...who will nurture my child? How will she afford good food? Need someone to take good care as I would... There is only one who can do that. Sir! Need to talk to Parithi sir. Sir Kicha wants to talk to you. What do you want to talk? I made a mistake sir. What do you mean? I started confessing to Parithi sir. But... ...his smartness made me disclose everything to him... ...is that I made him believe. But if I wanted to.. ...while going to get tea, I could've escaped. But I chose not to. Because my intention was to make Parithi sir believe me completely. Came back to the station. Confessed everything on my own. Sivasangu, Sangilipandi, Murugesan, Periyapandi, Mahendran, Maharajan, Senguttuvan, its a total of 8 sir. In Parithi's house... ...I knew he was behind me... ...so In pretended to be caring for his family. As for me... ...Parithi sir should trust me. And he did believe me. So my child is in good hands now. Are you serious? So you are the one who tricked him? You are a genius. Unbelievable. But the thing is... You've left your daughter with him. How will a cop look after accused's kid? That's the only concern. Brother! -Karuppu! -Sir! I bribed the people in jail so that he doesn't speak to anyone inside... ...but they have sent him like this? -What happened there? -Sir please listen to me. No Karuppu got to clarify. Sir I clarified sir he just was sitting there in the shaving area... ...and was forcefully given a clean shave. -He didn't speak anything to anyone. -He must have spit out let me check. Sir do not get worked up sir sit down. Let's leave from here quickly get inside sir. Move fast! Sir! I want to talk to you sir. Karuppu! I know you will not trust me. Even in the head missing case... He will frame it on Kicha. COnstable mind your business. Why spill words unnecesarily? Brother! -Water please! -You won't trust me. I swear that's towards where it is heading to. Karuppu! Kicha is running off. It's Parithi sir who is running not Kicha. Come on everyone I thought we'll get suspended. Never thought we'll get a reward. Hey! Keep calm. Welcome sir. Please give me an one kg cake. Strawberry or Butter Scotch sir? Give me black forest. OK Sir! Two five hundred rupee note sir. And for you sir? Why did you tear it sir? Two thousand . Name sir? Revathy! Oh! Is it mam's birthday sir? Sir, age sir? Eight years. Thank you sir! Thousand five hundred for the cake sir. Sir? You persuaded him to reveal everything and put hm behind bars. And buying his kid a birthday cake in that reward money. Did you manage to get him confess? Or not sure if he managed his child's custody with you. Up until now, Kicha has... ...claimed to have done all of this for his kid. He did not do anything for his kid. Rather than the girl being stamped as a murderer's kid, ...like Kicha wished for... Why shouldn't she grow up to be a cop's child? According to him... ...let me be the one to have lost this game. Sir, Cake sir. Tell me Revathy! Dad has come dear. When did your dad go back at all? He is here all the time. Not my parents... ...your parents are here.
