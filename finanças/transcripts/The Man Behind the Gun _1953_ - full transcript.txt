* THE MAN BEHIND THE GUN * For the first time I saw the Bay of San Pedro a few years before the south and north split in the civil war. San Pedro, California. Sea gate to a new piece of the USA. It seemed to be quite peaceful on the surface, happy and smiling, but underneath there was a lot of lies and intrigue. Intrigue was also my own playing field, but the steaks were now too big to play alone. I couldn't reveal my mission, but I needed help. I only had Monk, who came with me from Panama, to find another old friend. Olaf Swenson. A former soldier, now a stagecoach driver. You were lucky to find me! I had to ask for you in every canteen in Southern California. In the middle! Buckley's friends? Yes sir. They are following us from Panama City. They want to get rid of us, we have to stop them. It would be better to cover the bodies. That's easy. Too much! Olaf, you're going to drive the rest of the way to Los Angeles, Monk told me that you are the best at the stage. Of course sir. Forget vacations, home days are over. I like the land. What are you going to do well in these parts? Going to Los Angeles? Someone told me that he spent the autumn in the west and nobody asked him anything. Come for a walk with me and you will find some interesting answers. So it will be like going back to Mexico, the three of us together. Not so much. My new name is, Rick Bryce, remember that. Rick Pryce. Of course, Rick. If you want to say goodbye to the past, you better stop carrying a gun. It's his trademark. Here, give it to me. I will hide it on the stage. Olaf, go get some fresh ducks. Hyah!... Come on boys, rock that prank! I am amazed at your kindness. Los Angeles is waiting for me. Hey, take it easy on this juice from heaven, stranger. Why, is there no fresh water around here? Fresh water? Ah, let me talk, to you about water. Here when it rains, you get sick with this thing. I mean rain. You would like to save every drop. Every man has a hobby, I suppose. I like famous firearms. This killed more men than any other weapon in California. Maybe you like to take a look? Ah!... What interests you most, except me, Creegan? Maybe I should have some. For the revolution, Creegan? That day will come, Sheldon. At least it will be quick and clean, without vicious political machinations. Was that an allusion to me? Yes it was. California will leave the Union and become a slave state. You don't want slavery in California, do you? Southern California, lady. Mr. Creegan wants us to believe that lie that everyone, south of San Luis Obispo, they are of a separate and distinct race. He doesn't want to be a part of America. Just talk. But I will stand by my weapons, Sheldon. And, I mean, it's going too far. Very interesting. One of those ultra modern six shots? You haven't seen it before, huh? No, but I heard about him. I think it must be a memory. It has Sutro's name engraved on it. They scared children by that name, to make them behave. Sutro... Smelly road agent. Oh, that's not what I heard. He's a sharp sniper. The best, I couldn't defend myself against him. I would like to face it, with it in my hands. I would look you straight in the eye, whether brown or yellow. Look closely... What color do you see? Brown, Mr. Sutro. The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. But you just called him, a coward. I didn't use that word... not that way. But that's what it sounded like, and that's true. Any man is just brave, with a gun in his hand. You talk too much Miss. Tenderfoot. Apparently, I speak for myself. I happen to have two. It is just an expression. In the singular it is correct. I don't have time, to learn your grammar. Besides, what kind of man are you? Allying with this... this bandit? Madame, maybe he's a teacher, but I like your spirit. Just like you. As soon as you get some coins, you and I are going for a horse ride. You are insane? I would be, if I pass you. Too bad, I wanted you. Thank you so much, lion heart bitch. No, he makes an effort. I got nothing but my skin to fix. Come on, gentlemen. Empty your pockets! Looking out the window will not help you. My friend is sitting in the box upstairs with him. I took them off. They're here, Sutro. Give the signal that you are done here. All right, Kansas. We will stop after those rocks. Come down! All right, Sutro. Drop it, son. Starting young, huh? Yes, do you have any objections? I'm not a preacher. What is your name? Joaquin. Joaquin, I will give you a chance to start again and move in the right direction. Thank you very much! A p?. I apologize for insulting you. My name is Lora Roberts. If I could pay the favor, I would be happy. It's a promise? If you insist, of course. Well Miss, I think you can keep that. If someone invites you on another tour, use it like this. Touch your finger and press this little thing here, it's called a trigger. Uh... Come on. Los Angeles, very difficult miles from San Pedro. Here, under a very hot tropical sun... it's hard to believe that the City of Angels it also had a lot of profane activities. Rain water, 25 cents only! Yes Sir! The stage is coming! Diligence arrives. Is coming! Vic Sutro. They tried to rob us. I hope you make them pay, Captain Giles. Judging by the past performances here, I bet you will be free. The army will carry out the trial, as in court with civilians. Take these men into custody. Check the horse saddle bags. Yes. I suppose a lady came with you. Lora! Roy! I received your letter in Panama. This trip from Baltimore to San Christoval, crossing the isthmus on horseback. Or mule Mr. Captain... Won't you give me a little time, teach something? It is now dedicated to Miss. Roberts! Dedicated to a marriage. Gentlemen, didn't you bring a bouquet of flowers for the new teacher? I meant, for me. I came from San Diego to take a seat. Miss. Roberts, I'm going to charge you for what you promised me. You can help me become a good teacher. Teacher? You handle a revolver very well for a teacher. If I didn't have to fight, Mr. Creegan, they wouldn't be each other. I find it a little hard to believe after what I saw today. Well, there are many things you refuse to accept, Creegan. Accept the fact that you are looking for trouble, Senator. Someday you will find. Brown Creegan returned to making threats in public. It is good to see that you have the situation under control, Captain Giles. I don't think I heard your name, Sir. Pryce. Rick Pryce. Teacher? Exactly. He said he didn't know anything about guns. Very little! You remind me of someone, Mr. Pryce. A is, who? Major Ransome Callicut. From the Third Cavalry, by Zach Taylor. I heard about General Taylor. The resemblance is incredible. It's so big that... Excuse me, captain, this is not Callicut, you have my word. Why? Because we have known each other for years in Mexico. From the moment they took him out of the cavalry. A good man, with a revolver. So good that he was the one who killed an officer named Bentley in a duel. The court martial will hang Callicut for murder and desertion. It has nothing to do with me. My name is Pryce, Captain. Even so, you are very much like him. I am an ordinary citizen, living a peaceful life... surrounded by your books. Miss. Roberts. A pleasure, captain. School, teacher! Bluff! I think I'll ask Mr. Creegan if you can have him until we get married and have our own home. With Creegan I prefer not to, Roy. Why not? He's a revolutionary. Creegan is not revolutionary. You should have listened to him, talking on the stage! Just say that, Lora. Creegan is a hot southerner, with a short temper about, the problem of slavery. Your mouth is much worse than your bite. He owns the Los Angeles water company. Creegan will be the pillar of our community. Anyway, Roy, there must be another place I can stay. It's all right. I will ask Senator Sheldon to help us. Sutro! Do not shoot, suspend fire. Does this bastard threaten you? Shut up, the captain does not want interference. Stop! Or, I... I shoot! I warned you! I'll get it right this time. Here's an apple for you, professor. Do not play! Drop that knife. Quick, or I'll use my gun! Lock that man in prison. Yes Sir. It wasn't an accident, you worked it out. You're right. A good idea to know, if you are not Callicut. Did you risk the lives of civilians to see if I'm a man-at-arms? I didn't taste anything today, except that you need to handle a weapon better. Oh Roy, why don't you give it up? You have two plans in the teaching profession, don't you? Come on Lora, you have a courage I didn't suspect. I have other places to take you, I suppose. My little feet are very callous. Senator? Now, Mr. Pryce. You found a job. Yes, a little gardening. What are you planting? Passing the time. I have to do something different from the vines and cows. Until your friend Creegan controls most of the water. Do you have enough water to keep this creature alive? Ah, Creegan's days are over. Selling water and ice, at absurd prices. I will have a state reservoir, making water entry as a public good. Do you realize what that means? Everyone will be able to bathe. Well... and that means 20,000 people who live and work here. We will make this land as green as Kentucky. But many people have heard of this place. But, they didn't hear good things! More murders in this city last year than in the rest of the country. And the number is higher every year. Um... my sister, Phoebe! Mr. Pryce. Miss. Phoebe? Oh, yes, the teacher, I heard. You'll want to see Miss. Roberts. Lora! I came to say, thank you. Please do not elaborate further. You seem to be chasing me, madame. What you mean? Well, you told some people on the school board that I was, at the Bella Union Hotel. I made some simple songs, built a pair of nouns and then they invited me to be a teacher! You will not accept the position. Why not? It is a good chance to rehabilitate myself. Rehabilitate? Now! I felt like a dictionary, all afternoon. I will not allow you to influence children! This is all my fault. This is like molasses, which wants you to get stuck in it. Bme many people like molasses, but it can stop to worry about it now, I owe you a favor. The school will open in just a few weeks. Before opening... I will disappear, this I promise. Where are you going? North, where can I get easy money? Isn't that how criminals become criminals? Start by doing something dangerous, shooting a man and killing him? Dangerous? Now! You would do? Perhaps Roy, Captain Giles was right. Perhaps you are important. Prove it. But, if that's true, when it comes to dueling... was it a duel? This is a detail that only Callicut knows. Among other things. Like what? How to know how to make easy money here... or where he could fix it quickly. This seems reasonable. Not Mr. Price. The professor would not go anywhere, like Buckley's Palace. It sounds like a golden sin. Decent people don't go there. Yeah... Go on, madam... Senator Sheldon was talking about this. He's conducting investigations. If there is a revolution, it will depart from Buckley Palace. From then on out of the riff raff and outlaw. In that case, I'm Callicut, not Professor Pryce. Thanks for the alert. Did Ben communicate with the angels all this time? Make sure I keep my mouth shut. It looks like this is the place. Where? Buckley Palace. Well, great minds run in the same gutter. This is the place I was watching for you. I thought you would like to start a small business, where I could get some easy money. What do you have in mind? You will see. Olaf and I work hard, you'll find out. Now, he?s not really well educated, for them to keep the tips of their hats like that? Waiter? How about a table? Clear. Follow me around here. Oh I'm sorry. I imagine it is the appropriate place to settle. You can forget that. Olaf and I are going to take you north to hunt for gold, as soon as we have our piece of meat. Bring fun, Willian. Of course you know that we will jump off the ship after I quit my job, on the due diligence line? I will stay here. But why? You are already confused by that teacher. She works for the captain, he will step on your tail. I will stay here. Bring the change back. You will be naked and muddy, without a gun or a friend, all because of a beautiful face. I remember a few times, that you had your problems because of them. I learned my lesson. I changed. I don't know a single woman west of Laredo. Hello, fiery little monkey! Fiery little monkey? Who is this? Chona Degnon, the owner of the place. Chona Degnon? I thought it was Buckley's Palace. Buckley is just a murderous idiot. You don't have enough brains to run the place. I heard that Chona Degnon takes orders from someone else. From who? I don't know, it's not interesting for me. Just those $ 500 dollars, to get that move I was talking about. What will you do? You are hot? Until when? Aren't five hundred good for you? I'm going down the basement. It is where everything is handled. When Olaf gets here, you come down to join me. Well!... Now, Senator, just in time to join me in a toast. This is for Southern California independence. Free from corrupt Sacramento administration. I hope the senator lives long enough to regret this. Everything is ready. Monk is waiting for you. Find the basement door at the back of the stage. Good night, Senator. Hey, you better forget that stone, otherwise it will be crooked. Call the grandmother's daughter to find out. Just watch and tell me. It won't reveal anything here. We'll see tonight! $ 500 dollars in cash, for any man who raises that stone. Weighs 600 kilos. Good engineering work. He said he would raise a jury mast. Silence! Ten back, guys. Little man, small space to keep warm. Tonight... I will get this little stone for you. Come on, guys! It's time. The next sign will mean that he took the stone. Buddy, you're going to need a doctor. It took two mules to bring this stone here. You had to call me, Mr. Buckley, you would save the mules. I would like to know the color of the five hundred. It's green, my friend. But you don't have to be crippled. It is my own risk. Start, Olaf. Join these forces. Ten for one he gets! The ground seems to be breaking. No, it's the barrel. I think he will make it!... My God, he did it! He lifted the stone about six inches. He needs to give the signal to download. Bashas Bennigan's special office connects us. The senator is dead. Creegan! Creegan! He threatened my son Skip. Tex! Go to the home!... You have my money! Here, get that money out of here. Do I have to hold on, your neck? Listen, they just killed, Senator Sheldon up there! What? They said, that Creegan did that, but I will get out. Creegan? He's looking like a business. You need to get out of here, now. Be quiet! They won't go out with this! I needed three men in this job. Come on, talk! Lord Shark Teler, the mustache. Where is he? He got sleepy, went home. Take him now to the garrison. And that other one. They opened the weapon boxes! Where can I find Miss. Degnon? You do not know? Good night, Roy. It's goodbye, Chona. Not goodbye. I tried to explain it. It is not so easy, Roy. Yes? Miss, a famous lover once said, there are other fish in the river. Ah! Sir! They are beautiful! I'll put them in the vase! Thanks. You're out of your league, aren't you, professor? This is not exactly... a military barracks, Captain. What would Lora say if she found him here? Don't mention your name. Is her name very beautiful? Temperature of real challenges lead to duels, isn't it? This is the custom, it is not true?... Is the lady's name said out of place? Challenge! Quiet, Chona. You're scared, Roy, he's just a teacher. He's a killer. A defector Major in the Army. You have a fixed idea, Captain. I wrote to Washington send me details about Major Ransome Callicut. The news will take six weeks to get here. This is a long time for me to challenge you to a duel, for slandering me. Dueling rules are prohibited by the army. It is possible for a military officer to refuse, to give a poor teacher the due satisfaction? It can become a mockery in the city. I can assure you, Callicut... that I can beat you anytime, anywhere! So, Captain, an agreement: I will forget everything if you do me a favor. My two friends, Monk Walker and Olaf Swenson, are being kept, in the garrison of their garrison. Give him the usual three days, for his misconduct and then, return them to me. And why should I do that? I'll forget I saw you here. You made a deal. Bye! You are a very bad boy, huh? Just misunderstood, that's all. Roy thinks you are more dangerous than that. He's a very brave man, but... But? I would not like to duel with you. Yes? I need to talk to you. Miss, do you like to play? One moment! Betting what? That, against what I know, what does he want? Baby, I'm getting dressed, I'll talk later. This is a lot of money for a teacher. Where did you get that? Is the bet worth it? So... do you know what Buckley came to tell me? I think so. Well... I will tell you myself. Senator Sheldon was killed. Wow!.. And they're already trying to hang Se?or Creegan for this! When? Right now. But they will not succeed. Creegan is very important. It is needed elsewhere. I am seeing! You know everything, huh? I also know that you are staying at the Bella Union Hotel. I know when you're right. See you tomorrow, sir! So, now you've seen all the beaches you can come to, huh? But, you are not running a gun. The money you showed me, you spend eating out of Buckley. Who am I to argue? You are a liar, a malefactor. What you call an outcast. But on the outside, you're a good soldier too. Maybe I will make you, a General, huh? General? What is your military objective? The military objective is water. Yes, the water. Who controls the supply, controls southern California. Make everyone lick their boots. Exactly! What do you think the US Army is doing about it? Army? A handful of foolish men? You can always send more. Where? From the East Why not? By then, it will be too late. Southern California worries no one. For those gringos in Washington, they don't work. They don't deserve to be there. This is the land, Mr. Ricky, land and water will form an empire. Come on, I'll show you this! Mark Sheldon. Rest in peace. I'm sorry I didn't attend the funeral, Mrs. Sheldon. I understand that Captain Giles had important tasks. I couldn't wait for many people to pass the day in a cart to and from Santa Monica. If only he had time to stop this Creegan. Stop it, what? Only gradually can you be the killer. The only connection I can find between him and the insurrection, it's just a bunch of rumors. You may have looked too hard, Roy. Since you and Creegan are on the south side, then your vision is affected. Not even a little. I have patrols looking for him, he will be stopped to answer. Sorry, Mrs. Sheldon, but my fiance has doubts. Me too, Cap. Giles. So we are all in times like these. Who was that? Chona. Buckley's singer. Buckleys? What this place needed was a good teacher. More than you need a wife, Roy. How many thousands of acres would you like? Of this? You wouldn't cheat an old soldier with such a good proposal. You are so smart, Don Rick! Okay, that was really stupid. This is Rancho LaBrea. LaBrea? Bad soil. Look! The black hole makes the soil sterile. Take just a little. Little? I've already paid. But, would you like to see it? No, my eyes are closed. How do we continue with this? The devil poisons many men. Like you, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose. It is!... Major? We would empty our image for others. Like the great Sutro? He's one of us. And what about Captain Roy Giles? What about him? Do you think that if you have the water tank, deliver your garrison to us, all right? Because you are bad, you think badly of everyone. Chona, if you want me on that subject, don't try to be smart. Smart, Don Rick? To put my neck on, I want friendly hands. I want to speak to your commander. Bram Creegan or Roy Giles, done! The gringo! Always the same! We will see. This way it is very difficult to remove. In that tree you will find a fountain, it will help you. This document certifies that Major Ransome Callicut is a reputable officer, qualified to investigate secretly all military administrations in California. This is better. Much better. I changed my mind. Tonight you will meet the man you want to see. How about in my room, at Bella Union? It has a private entrance on the north side, on a small balcony. Great, eight hours! Be alone. It's open, Chona. I am not Chona. Come in, don't stand there... Someone told me where to find you. I came to get my books. Indian donor, huh? Well, take them back with my blessings. I need to know if I'm going to stay in school. What? And the wedding? It's being delayed! Why? Because this place needs a teacher. Not your sword. Besides, as far as I know, Roy can transfer... You don't know how right you are... looking for an idiot and stupid that could have. Creegan and Giles, right here in my hand. You don't have it. Right. The secrets are revealed, now. But you are wrong about Roy. I'm sure. He will prove it to you. I don't say anything to him... Buckley's will warn you, this is already public. Probably already channeling to them. I expect a visit here. You must leave. But you need help. Two weapons are better than one. Two...? So, the one I gave you...? What you mean? Don't be arrogant, Major. Excuse me, I... I keep forgetting that I became West Point as miserable as I am. I went up a long way. I know. You know? Roy showed me the report that came when you des... Deserted? His mother and father were killed by the Indians. The salvation cavalry found you astonished... covered in blood and black powder. Under the saber flag. It was how I learned religion. Religion? Duty, the army religion. Forget for a minute on a hit on the beach, and comes back with a saber blade injury. Duty is a God, Miss. Roberts, a jealous God. This makes the man unable to join, your pieces with your morale, down and... Yes... Yes, I think I understand, duty. The same thing that makes me a teacher in a place that... Of course, you have courage. We have to leave, now. High! Madam, take his gun. Santa Maria, I almost shot my friend. This is the young man of diligence. Yes. Joaquin Murietta. It was Chona, hired you, to shoot me. Who is your boss? She's the only one I know. I brought the rifles, which I smuggled for her. Will you work for me? Yes. Won't you try to change me again? I can try it someday, but you'll get rich first. I really appreciate it! Forgive me, miss. Business conversation. Just talk. But a small business has yet to be completed... You wordless little scorpion... So... too slow for you, but too fast for us. Don't try to find me, Sir. I will find you. My hotel... is my horse. Bye. Sign these parole passes. The light is dim, but you can see the line to sign. I can't see where. Put your signal here. Paper... you are so irresponsible for managing my life. I would have done it before, but I couldn't get rid of the promising little Captain. You quarrelsome cock! I still can't make up my mind. The teacher is nice, but Chona is a little more... original. If you don't stay outside the Captain's harem, you will be unique. Of course, if low tide starts, Major... it looks like we?ll both have to take care of you. Of course we were saying at the break. It will be bad when he's taking care of us. Duty, duty, duty, dirty the regular bronze war button. How big, Sergeant? Don't call me Sergeant. I proclaimed my own thanksgiving when I left your troop. But it didn't come out! Like? You didn't read, what you signed. You would have seen that they were forms of re-enlistment and do not parole. Oh no! I needed you for my mission. Headquarters can't even keep a coast guard on me. You are a deserter. You killed Buckley. The general thanked me for that. Buckley was a spy. He sold important information. But he was your best friend. I had to get rid of him. He didn't need another traitor on record. You are not human, Rick. Sir. Not for me. Nothing but murderous iron heels. Stand up, Sergeant! Attention, Corporal! Don't try to go over the hill. The army has great reach and you can have what Bentley had. It's a kind of alarm, sir. It sounds like this when someone escapes. You have your orders. Obey. Did you hear, sergeant? I wish I was born without superiors... He was not born, he was born! Save me the trouble of paying him a visit. I was on my way when Sutro escaped. Sutro? I expected this, it's the second time. Come here with me. Envious civilians gave Sutro a toolkit to escape. He liked this exchange. One of yours? Are you still babbling this propaganda, even instigating Lora? She said that? You told me nothing... when it looks wonderful. I was with you last night. Attention at that point! His friends from Buckley, pulled his head to bite him, then you left Sutro free. You thought it was a gun, but you could take me. You are completely safe from him, Bryce. You are under arrest for undermining military authority. How do you like your new home? Major Ransome Callicut... secretly investigating every military in California. Attention! Major Ransome Callicut, is my new superior in this position. Dismissed. The office? This way, Sir. Sit down. Sir... I... I apologize for my mistake about you. I couldn't know about your orders. But... But what? You saw me with Chona. It is not necessary to apologize for that. You gave me a lesson and a protection service. The way the peacocks taught at the academy. Prejudice, Sir. No, not at all. Maybe he was bored, for waiting. Nothing more, huh? Maybe a little more? Clear. Even the guilt that things, got out of your control... what did you want to do with all those weapons? Weapons? Under the basement. I saw them, Captain. And I saw you there, too, the night Sheldon was killed. Major... Sit down! I break you right now, for taking and hiding. Creegan so well that I still couldn't find it. So, you will keep your beautiful currencies if you bring it to me. You are crazy? You let the knights save Creegan from the watchmen. Why didn't you want me to look at him? Why I didn't have men to spare. I folded the guards at the water tank. You and Bram Creegan are from Virginia. It doesn't mean that I would leave he and Buckley take part of California. And could it? Give him a signal that you vote in Congress and make Southern California a slave state. Getting what you want in Washington, at the same time make a withdrawal here. Be aware that I was sent here to stop you and Creegan. I didn't know about you. But you got Creegan. I'll cut off the head, from the scorpion and without your legs you won't be able to crawl. Now, get up! We are going to Bucley's. And you will enter that stuffed arsenal in front of me. They won't shoot you, Captain. Why won't they have the chance to receive the guys and deliver too. Now, move. Vic Sutro! Do not provoke. Keep walking, you're safe. You crazy soldier. Oh, am I? Friend, crazy are you, more than said that I am! I'm worried about you, you can't afford to keep me alive! I like to hear that, Major. Stop hitting me, that's right. You can tell your attorney Roberts that his superiors, they will eat crows, with feathers and everything. Due to special orders, Major Ransome Callicut of the Union Army... is taking over, the command of this post. By order of General Hinfield Scott. Roy Giles Captain. Miss. Phoebe. Roy told me that I found out, that I was very wrong. You don't have to clear your name with me. I was never part of your suspicions. Suspicious? Ah, I... I apologize. Not for that, Miss. Sheldon. You came to Los Angeles to help us, didn't you? Lora, when you're done with the visit, call me. I still have something to say to the Major. Of course, Miss. Sheldon. What about that, now? I wouldn't worry. She will forget about it. It's like living, with spirits in this house. Sometimes I can hear you talking at night. It is time for Roy Giles to take the reins in his teeth and take it to the pastor. Time has expired, for Roy and me. Time, distance... we are no longer the same, two people. Who met more than 3000 miles away. But, you are still the same girl he describes. Do not. No, the environment makes a big difference. A great wild world, it is a competitive market. I can see the difference in Roy, now. See, in a few moments. What are you doing? Why? It is your duty. To owe? Is everything you know, duty? Let me tell you something, there is no regulation manual for human emotions. Good night, Major. Rick! Did you let the Big One out? I needed to say something to him. Senator Sheldon! You spoke? Tin head. Traitor! She didn't say anything! I wish I did. He's behind everything. He let everyone believe that he had been murdered and then hid behind a grave. It seems that you have only just become aware. But you haven't made an appointment, Phoebe. You have a lot to say to your Captain Giles, don't you? You can also tell him that I am controlling the reservoir! You are not going to hold them, people. Which people? Thirsty mafia. Dodge their water and they will come crawling towards us. I took the guns and the men to be sure. Mark Sheldon! Patriot! That was a very convincing mask, wasn't it? I will declare sovereignty over the state of Southern California! Congress will be happy to vote on this to prevent the rebellion from spreading. State? An empire. Your own empire. Did you know about it and say nothing? Blood is thicker than water, you know. And my dear sister's conscience awoke in time to deprive me of the advantage of surprise. Miss Roberts! Take them to Santa Monica Bay, put them on my boat. Mark! Not Lora! Great idea, Phoebe. Release it! Prisoner of War, Senator Sheldon? No, hostage. Maybe you have had the good fortune to tell him that I could be very unhealthy for you. Good night, Major. Was it a little call of duty? You don't have to put your neck on the Pillory for me! No, Lora is not a good option. And why not? Now, are you going to put that in your report to headquarters, sir? You would be promoted and very quickly if you married in a church. Of course, this is my idea too. Take a gun and let her know who's boss. Get that frog dream out of your eyes. Know what to do to a woman. Major, will you bring me a little closer to the drill? I will not be here. I'm going to take the east trail, right now. And leave me in a powder keg? No, there's a huge powder keg in town and they're all at Buckley's. I have an internal operator, the name... Joaquin Murietta. He started to provide me with information. But, Murrieta is a bandit! Place a thief to catch thieves. They still got the rifles, I know that. They are confident in you. They know that men are missing. They will repel any direct attack we make. But if I had a few more recruits, I would take the offensive. A small army unit cannot control Southern California. We will attack first. Tonight! Probably open, Creegan will not hear. What are my orders, Major? Not yet. Not allowed registration note about this. I'll go with you. Hold your post. So now you're going to slap me, sir? Come on! I bet you do this time. That's right. Joaquin told me... that he will not attack us. They could change their minds! Buckley is up to something. You're right. Forming the coast guard. I don't think they will come here just to find out if we are going to raise the white flag. This is what they think. Probably Alonso is now in the basement. The doctor has just said, that he is ready. Let's get the rifles out. Water! $ 32 cents a shot! Whiskey? You can experiment. You made a sale, boy. Keep the change. It's very good whiskey, sir. My mom, she does it herself. She gets my dad drunk. You will like it, Sir. Help you forget your problems! Very fast! I can be sure, only one side counts everything with sauce. Like? Don't you know Spanish? She is telling them to come! So much path. My heart awaits you. Waiter! What do you want, gentlemen? Do not move. Get out of here, otherwise your post will be without command. How about you? I am waiting to be sure that Joaquin did not disappoint in the basement. Give me your pistol. Move on! This is your order! Place the napkin on the table. Do you want something more, Sir? Do not go away. Put everybody out! Keep walking! Go around the casino! Great job, Joaquin. My style of doing work. I must get rid of three or four, who recognized me. Oh, all my weapons! They will kill one by one. How cowardly you are. Get your men out of here! Go to Senator Sheldon's camp. I know where to buy more weapons. Do you think you can negotiate, selling more rifles? If I don't have any more to sell, they would buy elsewhere. Promise him that he only delivers it, in his hiding place. Yes, in the killer's hideout! Let's get out of here. Major Callicut, Sir? This is Mayor Nickolson and some ranchers from California. Thank you for coming, gentlemen. The men move westward to Santa Monica. Tomorrow I will tell you the exact place where they set up camp. Captain Giles will take charge of this operation. My forces are guarding the reservoir. Why water I wonder if the day will come when everyone will have plenty of water. Sergeant Walker, follow them and wait for other orders. That's all, gentlemen. Why did you do that, Sir? This what? Why did you give me the command of this operation? No mission, Captain. Clear. I don't need to tell you, that I'm ambitious, but... I didn't imagine you as a Santa Claus. More like an old devotion and penance, or something, Sir? Penance, me? But I didn't learn that at the gym. I'm sorry, Sir. I know you just want to help Lora and me. My men found this at Sheldon's ranch, Sir. There is a name written on the inside pocket, Bram Creegan. Did you find that at Sheldon's ranch? Yes, Sir, in the bushes behind the senator's grave. Bullet potholes. About four. Did your friends shoot Creegan after Sheldon's murder? No Sir. When Buckley's men took off. Creegan from the gallows they took him fast. And Bucley's men took him to Sheldon's farm. Creegan appears to have used his coat to treat the wound. Who shot Creegan? No man in the pack would kill his leader. If it was someone who tried to avenge Sheldon we should know about that. But... What do you mean, Sir? Miss. Phoebe Sheldon said she wanted to say something to me. Something to do with Creegan and his brother. Mr. Sheldon! Take a good look, boy. To find out who will hang you if you don't bring new rifles. Ah, there is something I want to talk about first. How much gold is in that bag, if not? Five million dollars. You will receive two of these when you deliver the rifles. Half now! Why, you little crawling Indian! We have to trust him, boss. Yes, but I will not deliver to this house. If you do, Miss. Roberts prisoner, it will soon be hotter than Buckley Palace. We will go to my camp. I'll show you where it is. Oh... good. Why do you cheat, you two-faced conniving! Ms! What did you mean by two-faced? What does she mean? Are you talking about the army? Answer me! Tell about it. If you do it again... You what? I will kill you. Daughter of a devil! I will resume what you took from me. And what could you have that I wanted? Chona!... Silence! This is Major... and Roy! Alone? Yes. Answer them. Answer them! Rick? Yes? Isn't it a little late for a visit, Major? This is not a social visit. I want to speak to Mrs. Phoebe Sheldon. Tell them to enter. She went to bed and was ready to do it myself. Look, Lora... Good night, Major. If you say good night, she'll think, Major. Lieutenant Kablett. Take your men to Sheldon Ranch... and wait for me there, with Corporal Swanson, Come on, come on follow me Stop at the garrison and order Sergeant Ronnie I want two guards posted to this house. No one can enter, or leave without my orders. Yes sir. These two guards will be responsible... for the safety of Miss. Roberts. Yes Sir. I need to take a load off my conscience, Sir. The way you take care, remember that love song, All right. Captain, we are on a mission. That's exactly it. I'm afraid that Lora will run out, by a handful of orders. If it runs out, it will be on your orders. Now, I will do the rest of your work for you. Put that rifle down, or we'll never get out of here. Take the girl and the young man to my camp. He's gone! And my horse too! Open the coffin. Bram Creegan! It was what Phoebe wanted to tell me. What, Sir? The day that Chona spent on the road, Phoebe saw me and knew that her brother was not buried here. Not Sheldon... Alive, responsible for that. Well, it all fits together. He prepared his funeral, he accused Creegan... and kidnapped Creegan before the guards could hang. And we were looking for Creegan. While Sheldon was free to lead the rebellion. Okay, men, leave it as it was. Lora! Sheldon's prisoner! Gentlemen, Senator Mark Sheldon... We know. And Miss. Roberts? They took her. Where? Who knows? Sheldon almost revealed it to me, but I had to leave quickly. Corporal Swenson told me where to find you. I tried to hurry, but the horse was upset and wanted to go somewhere else. Whose is the horse? Here it says, MS. Mr. Mark Sheldon. Take my horse. I ride this one. I will make a detailed report on the way back to the post. When I gave the horse freedom, he took us to camp. I knew I was doing wrong by excluding everything, but, it was my life's duty. The most important thing in my mind was not the capture of Sheldon, but the safety of Lora. This horse will find its way home. She will find Sheldon in the forest. It looks like he's going to the River Canyon. Hide! Don't let him pass, they'll probably have a lookout around. You fools... you're going to lose all your chances. I was coming today so that... What are you talking about? There are rumors... I was going to see! You dirty traitor... What is this? I was trying prevent it... from drying out the reservoir. Lora is a prisoner. Can not you wait. Let us have the reservoir. Let us have the reservoir! Keep the south against this fight. Any discomfort can be a bloody weapon. It is better to accept the offer, otherwise... Murrieta? Yes, Sir Major? Put him on a horse and take him to the city. Yes Sir. We wait for dawn. Without the advantage of surprise? I have another plan. What about Lora? You will follow my command, Captain! I will mention you in the hero's dispatches! If I die like that. Don't bury me, just scent the body. As you wish. From a distance you really resemble a woman. Yes? Anyone who approaches will be surprised. Sgto. Walker, you are Mrs. Swenson. Yes sir! In your positions, men! Stand by your horses. Do you think you will succeed? Quien knows. If this Trojan horse cannot with the forces of the men in the Sheldon pickets, nothing else can. You and your men will be better off with their heads down. We'll fill that canyon with shots. Don't worry about us. Make sure you carry out your orders right. I will be with my men as close as I can. Right. When you hear fire, you'll know we've hit the mess. It will be a signal to attack. Is fast! All right, you can go. Prepare mount! Assemble! Major's leg show has more miles to walk than wrecking ball. The numbers will need more guitars. The Major will take care of that, won't he? High! Fix that costume. Put on this respectable outfit. Poor Callicut, he can certainly sing dead load commands. Who are you? Me and my wife and her brother. We look for a place, where we can settle. You can go see what's on that cart. What are you taking? 200 kilos of smoked meat, Sir. We will need each chunk, for the children. Come on, you're sure to have a good place to raise your son, man. Of course, it made me overrated. Never know. Yes, with Callicut thinking he is ready to get rid of it. I do not know. I think it was like taking some kind of medicine. I took a look at your office table yesterday. So, I read what I thought was the parole papers and in those enlistment papers that we signed and were nothing! You mean we didn't sign a realist? No! He carries some kind of drug, which deceives him. It claims the restoration of its power. Oh, one day Callicut will be careless! If we are not going to use it for us, what will we do with you? You won't do anything to me! You seem very sure of yourself. Search her. Sit-se, girl! You are nothing, Chona, you have no chance. Maybe not. But if you want to get out alive, I wish you didn't! Who are these? Settlers say they bring supplies. Hope so. Did you check the cart? No. It is better to do it now. Stop! Drop it! Don't raise your hands. Dismantle! Come behind the wagon. Where is Sheldon? The Major would like an answer. Would you like to have a black tongue? Around... It's by these rocks. How many men? More than you have here. Call your mate here. Luke! Come here. Come here. Come on down here, everything is fine. Look over there! I will be one of them the rest of the way. Take off your clothes. Give me your shirt, quick. Oh my God, in front of a woman! Your outfit is our ticket to enter Sheldon's camp. Bring me your horse. How did that cart get here? It looks like Lucas is with them. Everything must be fine. Waiting is his job. I hope that... Buckley didn't make a deal to send you home. He's our secret, girl. I'll tell you something... I would hate my own people, if they made such a deal. I do not think so. Besides, I didn't want you to do it. I want to return you to him, home, with an unforgettable face. Let's stop here. Stop. Listen to me. Listen! You can have Roy. He's not for me. I just want you to testify against Sheldon. I am sure that the Major will not allow anything to happen to you. I'm sorry, ma'am. Go inside! Come in and protect yourself! Soldier, stay with her. She's in there. You wanted water, so take it! Take some more! You know... I remembered what you said. That we would deal with Callicut at some point. Well, I have to act now. I think, that is the right time. I imagine that we will have our turn, maybe in two more years. "THE END"
