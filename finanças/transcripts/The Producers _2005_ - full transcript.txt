We couldn't leave faster What a disaster We are still in shock Who produced this schlock That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock What a bum Hello? Mr. Bialystock? Anybody here? Mr. Bialystock? Who are you? What are you doing here? What do you want? Speak to me, dummy, speak! Why don't you speak? Scared. Can't talk. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Calm down. Get a hold of yourself. Come with me. There. Come on. Come on. Come on. Right this way. Watch your step. Look. Just... Take a deep breath. Let it out slowly. - Who are you? - I am Leopold Bloom. I'm an accountant. I'm from Whitehall & Marks and I have come here to do your books. Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen... Who is it? Hold me, touch me. Hold Me-Touch Me. One of my backers. Listen, I have to meet with an important investor. Do me a big favor. Go to the bathroom. - But I don't have to go. - Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls. Be with you in a moment, my darling! Hold Me-Touch Me. Where is Hold Me-Touch Me? Kiss Me-Feel Me, Pinch Me-Pinch Me, Lick Me-Bite Me, Suck Me-F... Here she is. Hold Me-Touch Me. You know, it worked. As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls... - Back! Back! Don't make a sound. - I didn't have any problems... Coming. Coming. Better. Hello, gorgeous. - Hold me, touch me. - As soon as I shut the door. Did you bring the checkie? Bialy can't produce plays without checkies. Here you go. But first, can we please play a game? One dirty little game. All right, my little sex kitty. What shall we play? - The Debutante and the Bricklayer? - Oh, no. No. How about the Rabbi and the Contortionist? You like that one, Mama, keeps you limber. I know. Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid and the Well-Hung Stable Boy. I don't think I have the strength. - Oh, don't worry. I'll be gentle. - All right. Oh, dear! This milk is so heavy. I'll never reach the house. You there, well-hung stable boy. Won't you please help me? Of course, my little dairy queen. First, I'll take your milk. Then I shall take your virginity! No. No. Never. No. Yes. Yes. Give it to me, well-hung, give it to me. Darling, wait! I haven't even had coffee yet. Take it easy. Take it easy. Oh, my God! - Send me to the moon, you animal. - Yes. - Send me to the moon. - Yes. Yes, my darling. Thursday. Come back Thursday. I'll send you to the moon Thursday. I may even join you. But first the checkie. Where's the checkie? Come on, come on, find the checkie. Oh, here you go. I made it out like you told me. - To the title of the play, "Cash." - Yes. It's a funny name for a play, "Cash." Yes. So was The Iceman Cometh. I'll see you Thursday. Ta-ta. Ta-ta. - Bye. - Bye. - Ta-ta. - Bye. Yes, yes, yes. You dirty old buzzard. May I come out of the bathroom now, Mr. Bialystock? Yeah, sure. I'm terribly sorry I caught you feeling up the old lady. "Feeling up the old lady." Thank you, Mr. Tact. - May I take your coat? - Oh, thank you. - So, you're an accountant? - Yes, sir, I am, sir. Then account for yourself! Why are you looking up little old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert, eh? I know what you're thinking. How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts? - Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't... - Shut up! I'm having a rhetorical conversation. - Do you know who I used to be? - Why, yes. Yes. You were Max Bialystock, the King of Broadway. No, I'm Max... That's right. - That's right. - And might I say, Mr. Bialystock, and please don't take this the wrong way, but you're not just a dirty old man. Thank you. You're also a great Broadway producer. And there's something about me you should know. When I was a kid, I had the good fortune to be taken to Bialyhoos of Forty-Two. - Oh, Bialyhoos? - Yes. Yes. And I still have the ticket stub. - Oh, look at that. - Yeah. And ever since, I've had a secret desire to be a Broadway producer. A secret desire, huh? Well, kid. Can I give you a little advice? - Yes, sir. - Keep it a secret. Do the books, please. Top drawer to the left. Oh, my God! Will you look at that? That's it, baby! When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it! Mr. Bialystock, may I speak to you a minute? - A minute? - Yes. - Just one minute? - Yes. - Okay. - In glancing at your books... - Go! - I noticed that... You have 58 seconds left. You've wasted two seconds. - You're gonna time it? - Time is money. Right. Well, I looked at your books, I looked at the columns marked "Plays Received"... - 48 seconds. 48 seconds left. - And I can't make the figures... - Hurry! Hurry! - Mr. Bialystock, there's a problem with your figures. Twenty-eight seconds. You're running out of time. - Tick-tock, tick-tock... - I cannot... - I cannot. I cannot... - Fifteen seconds. Twelve. - I cannot function... - 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. under these conditions. - You're making me extremely nervous. - I was... - What is that, a handkerchief? - What? This? No, this is... It's nothing. It's nothing. Well, if it's nothing, then why can't I see it? My blanket! My blue blanket! Give me back my blue blanket! Give me my blanket! Give it to me. Give it to me. Give me the blanket! Give it to me. Give it to me, please. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give me the blanket. - Here, here, here, here. - Give it to me. Don't panic. Don't panic. Don't panic. I... I'm sorry. It's just that I don't like anyone touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. But I've had it ever since I was a baby and I find it very comforting. I need to lie down for a minute now. They come here. They all come here. How do they find me? Hey, kid. Hey. Yoo-hoo! Look at this. How can I help you? What's wrong? - You're gonna jump on me. - What? - You're gonna jump on me. - No. - I know you're gonna jump on me... - No. Calm down. - and squash me like a bug. - Oh, God. Please don't jump on me. I'm not gonna jump on you. I'm not gonna jump on you. Get a hold of yourself. Stop it. Stop it. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't touch me. Don't touch me. What's the matter now? I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I can't stop when I get like this. I can't stop. I'm hysterical. I can see that. All right. All right. I'm coming, I'm coming. Take it easy. All right. I'm coming. I'm coming now. All right. I'm wet. I'm wet. I'm hysterical and I'm wet. I'm in pain. I'm in pain, I'm wet and I'm still hysterical. All right, all right. What can I do? You're getting me hysterical. Well, move away. You'll frighten me. You're too close. - I frighten you? - Yes, get over there and stop touching all this. Move over there, get over there - and sit down. - I'm sitting. I'm sitting. You still look angry. I'm sorry. How's this? Who's my little accountant? Who's my little accountant? Are you my little accountant? Are you my little accountant? - I am the man. - Are you my little accountant? - I am. - Yes, you are. Well, thank you for smiling. That helped a great deal. Well, you know what they say? "Smile and the world smiles with you." This man should be in a straitjacket. - You feeling better? - Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you. Good. May I speak to you? Yes, Prince Myshkin. What can we do for you? Well, this is hardly the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock. I've discovered a serious error in the accounts of your last show, - Funny Boy. - Where? What? Well, according to the backers list, you raised $100,000 but your show only cost $98,000. There's $2,000 unaccounted for. I went to a Turkish bath. Who cares? The show was a flop. Bloom, do me a favor. Move a few decimal points around. You can do it, you're an accountant. You're part of a noble profession. The word "count" is part of your title. - That's cheating. - It's not cheating. It's charity. Bloom, you see this stick pin? This once held a pearl as big as your eye. I used to wear handmade Italian shoes, $500 suits. And look at me now. Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt. Bloom. You gotta save me. I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to prison. Help me! All right. All right. - Okay, I'll do it. - Really? - Yes, I'll do it. - Wow. Let's see, $2,000 isn't so much. - I'm sure I can hide it someplace. - Yeah. Yeah. After all, the IRS isn't interested in a show that flopped. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm going to take a little nap. Well, let's see. Let's see, if we add up these deductions we get, carry the three, divide by four... Amazing. It's absolutely amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. Yes, it's quite possible. If he were certain that a show would fail, a man could make a fortune. - Yes? - Yes, what? Yes what you were saying. Keep talking. What was I saying? You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer can make more money with a flop - than he could with a hit. - Well, yes. It's quite possible. You keep saying that, but you don't say how. Well, it's simply a matter of creative accounting. Let's assume for a moment, that you are a dishonest man. - Assume away. - All right. When you produced your last show, Funny Boy, you raised $2,000 more than you needed. But you could have raised $1 million, put on your $100,000 flop and kept the rest. - But what if my show was a hit? - Well, then you would go to jail. You see, rather than 100% of the show, you would have sold more than 1,000%. So if the show's a success, there's no way to pay off the backers. - Get it? - Got it. So in order for our scheme to work, we'd have to find a surefire flop. Our scheme? What scheme? "What scheme?" Your scheme, you bloody little genius! I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little academic accounting theory. - It was just a thought. - Bloom. Worlds are turned on such thoughts. Don't you see, Bloom? Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom. It's so simple. Step one, we find the worst play ever written. Step two, we hire the worst director in town. Step three, I raise $2 million. - Two? - Yes. One for me, one for you. There's a lot of little old ladies out there. Step four, we hire the worst actors in New York and open on Broadway. And before you can say "step five," we close on Broadway, take our $2 million, and go to Rio. Rio? Oh, no, that would never work. Oh, ye of little faith What did Lewis say to Clark when everything looked bleak What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing As they struggled toward Everest's peak What did Washington say to his troops As they crossed the Delaware I'm sure you're well aware What did they say? We can do it We can do it, me and you We can do it We can make our dreams come true Everything you've ever wanted Is just waiting to be had Beautiful girls wearing nothing but pearls Caressing you, undressing you and driving you mad No. Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute now. Hear me out. Just think about it. We can do it, we can do it This is not the time to shirk We can do it, you won't rue it Say goodbye to petty clerk Hi, producer! Yes, producer I mean you, sir, go berserk We can do it, we can do it And I know it's gonna work What do you say, Bloom? What do I say? Finally a chance to be a Broadway producer What do I say? Finally a chance to make my dreams come true, sir What do I say? What do I say? Here's what I say to you, sir I can't do it, I can't do it I can't do it, that's not me I'm a loser, I'm a coward I'm a chicken, don't you see? When it comes to wooing women There's a few things that I lack Beautiful girls wearing nothing but pearls Chasing me, embracing me I'd have an attack Why you miserable, cowardly, wretched, little caterpillar! Don't you ever want to become a butterfly? Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory? No. - Where to? - Central Park. Gotta breathe. Gotta breathe. - We can do it, we can do it - Mr. Bialystock, stop this song - We can grab that Holy Grail - You got me wrong, I say, "So long" I'm not as strong a person as you think - We can do it. We can do it - Mr. Bialystock, just take a look - I'm not a crook, I'm just a schnook - Drink champagne - The bottom line is that I stink - Not ginger ale - Come on, Leo, can't you see, oh? - I can't do it You see Rio, I see jail Driver, stop! Here. We can do it I can't do it We can do it I can't do it - We can do it - I can't do it - We can - I cannot, cannot, cannot do it 'Cause I know it's gonna fail Fail? How can it miss? All you need is a little courage. Bloom, do you know what you are? You're like a... You're like a... You're like a fountain waiting to explode and shoot into the sky. - I'm a fountain? - Yes, you're a fountain. Don't you realize there's a lot more to you than there is to you? Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made a terrible error in judgment. You've mistaken me for someone with a spine. I'm going back to Whitehall & Marks now. - No. - Goodbye forever. Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute. Bloom. Think about it. You'll never get a cab at this hour. Bloom. Oh, Lord. Dear Lord. I want that money. Unhappy, unhappy Very unhappy Unhappy, unhappy Very, very, very, very very, very, very unhappy Bloom. Where the hell have you been? You are six minutes late. This is an accounting firm, not a country club. You can't come and go as you please. Yes, Mr. Marks. Remember, you're a nobody. A PA, a public accountant. And I am a CPA, a certified public accountant. A rank a miserable little worm like yourself - could never hope to achieve. - Yes, Mr. Marks. - Thank you for speaking to me. - You're welcome. What are you gawking at? You never saw a person humiliated before? Now get back to work. All of you. Unhappy, unhappy Very, very, very, very very, very, very unhappy Boo!

Wait a minute. - Very, very unhappy - Hold everything. Hold everything. - Unhappy What am I doing here? Mr. Bialystock was right. There is a lot more to me than there is to me. Stop the world, I wanna get on. What the hell is going on in here? Do I smell the revolting stench of self-esteem? Bloom, where do you think you're going? You've already had your toilet break! I'm not going into the toilet. I'm going into show business. And Mr. Marks, I have news for you. I quit! And you're right about one thing. You are a CPA, - a certified public asshole. - Hurray!

When I said that I was scared that I was going to go to jail, I didn't realize that I already was in jail. I've spent my life counting other people's money. People I'm smarter than. Better than. When's Leopold Bloom going to get his share? When is it going to be Bloom's Day? I want... I want... I want everything I've ever seen in the movies. And Leo, you're gonna have it 'cause... - We can do it, we can do it - I'm gonna be a producer Say goodbye to woe and gloom - With the millions and the zillions - I'm gonna be a producer Up together we will zoom We can do it, we can do it Every show I touch, I doom We were fated to be mated We're Bialystock and Bloom Max. Oh, Max, let's give up. I can't read anymore. How many plays can a person read? Stop complaining. We have to find the worst play ever written. - I've been reading all night. - Who cares? You wanna be a producer, read, read, keep reading. Here's one. Act 1, Scene 1. "Gregor Samsa awoke one morning "to discover that he had been transformed into a giant cockroach." Nah, too good. "But how could you see me? The glass was frosted..." Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I've read this before. I think I've read this one. What's it called, what's it called? "The Frosted Glass." Max, I'm reading plays that I read last night, Max. I can't go on anymore. It's too much. Let's face it, we'll never find it. We'll never find it? We'll never find it, huh? We'll never find it, huh? We'll never find it, huh? Leo, Leo, see it? Smell it, touch it, kiss it. Kiss it! It's the mother lode. What is it? You found a flop? "A flop." That's putting it mildly. This is a catastrophe. A disaster. Certain to offend peoples of all races, creeds and religions. A guaranteed- to-close-in-one-night beauty. - Well, let's see it. - Yeah. "Springtime for Hitler." "A gay romp with Eva and Adolf at Berchtesgaden." Oh, my God. "Oh, my God" is right. It's practically a love letter to Hitler. - Max, this won't run a week. - A week? Are you kidding? This play has got to close on page 4. What's the author's name again? Franz Liebkind, 61 Jane Street, New York, New York. Franz Liebkind, 61 Jane Street. Let's go. We'll get the Broadway rights to Springtime for Hitler even if we have to go as far as to pay him. Come on. This other hat, Max, may I wear it? - No, you may not. - Why? Because, that is a Broadway producer's hat. And you don't get to wear a Broadway producer's hat, son, until you're a Broadway producer. And you're not a Broadway producer, until you... I know, I know. Until I've produced a show on Broadway. But, I'm going to wear that hat, and soon, too, 'cause... We're gonna be the producers Of a great big Broadway flop Ja, ja, my lieblings. Let me grab you, ja. We have work to do. Hilda, my darling, here, I have written an important message which must reach Ernst Schlongdorf, 29 West Santiago Boulevard, Buenos Aires, Argentina. AQAP. As quick as possible! Fly, Hilda, fly. Hilda, where are you going? Argentina is that way. Okay, chow time. Yummy, yummy, yummy, goes right into your belly. It's just a hunch, but I'm betting this is our man. Max, he's wearing a German helmet and lederhosen. Yeah, I know. Don't notice. Don't notice anything. Always look straight ahead. Remember, we need that play. Franz Liebkind? I was never a member of the Nazi party. I only followed orders. I had nothing to do with the war. I didn't even know there was a war on. We lived in the back, right across from Switzerland. All we ever heard was yodeling. Who are you? Relax, Mr. Liebkind. We're not from the government. We're producers, Bialystock and Bloom, here to talk to you about your play. - My play? - Mmm-hmm. You mean, Springtime for... You-know-who? - That's the one. - What about it? We love it. Don't we love it? We love it. - We think it's a masterpiece. - We want to put it on Broadway. Broadway? Oh, joy of joys. Dream of dreams. I can't believe it. - I must tell my birds. - Tell your birds. Otto, Bertha, Heinz, Heidi, Wolfgang... Adolf. Do you hear? We are finally going to clear the Fuehrer's name. Broadway! You know, not many people know this but the Fuehrer was a terrific dancer. Really? Gee, we didn't know that, did we, Leo? No, no, we sure didn't. That is because you were taken in by the BBC. Filthy, British lies. But did they ever say a bad word about Winston Churchill? Churchill. With his cigars, with his brandy and his rotten paintings. Rotten. Hitler, there was a painter. He could paint an entire apartment in one afternoon. Two coats. Yes, yes. Yes, of course he could, Mr. Liebkind, and that is exactly why we want to produce your play. Show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you loved. The Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart. Here, Franz Liebkind, sign here and make your dream a reality. - Nein. - Nein? - No. - That's what "nein" means. First, you must prove to me that you believe as I believe by joining with me and singing and dancing the Fuehrer's favorite tune, "Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop." I know. - Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop? - Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop. Oh, no, I could never sing the Fuehrer's favorite... - Delighted, delighted. - Song. Shut up, he's almost ready to sign. All right, first you will roll up your pants. - Rolling, rolling. - Rolling, rolling. Come on, don't be stingy, show some leg. - Alrighty, good. - Good. - Key of E? - Is there any other? Guten Tag hop hop Guten Tag clop clop Ach du lieber Und oh boy! Guten Tag clap clap Guten Tag slap slap Ach du lieber What a joy! Oh, wir essen und fressen Und tanzen und trinken Tanzen und trinken Until we get stinking Everybody. Guten Tag hop hop Guten Tag clop clop Guten Tag, mein lieber Schatz So we hop our hops Und we clop our clops Und we drink our Schnapps Till we platz You will sway We will sway Follow me. Very good. - Handschlagspiel. - Whatever you say. This is a tricky one Oh, the hop-clop. It's been so long. Sort of a Nazi hoedown. Gentlemen, you may produce my play. Excellent, excellent. Here we are. Here. But only if you take the Siegfried Oath. The Siegfried Oath? What's that? The pledge of eternal allegiance to our beloved Fuehrer. Never - took that oath before. - Good. One for me, one for you, and one for you. Never had one of those on before. - Thanks very much. - You're welcome. Nice colors. Look, reversible. - Oh, yeah, you're right. - Max. Max, we never should have started this. I think we're getting in too deep. Too deep? This is nothing. I'll tell you when we're getting in too deep. All right. First, you raise your right forefinger und repeat after me. I solemnly swear... I solemnly swear. To obey the sacred Siegfried Oath. To obey the sacred Siegfried Oath. Und... - Und... - Und. - Never, never, never... - Never, never, never. Dishonor the spirit und the memory of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler. Dishonor the spirit and the... Elizabeth? Ja, that was his middle name. Not many people know this but the Fuehrer was descended from a long line of English queens. Is that right? Yes. Adolf Elizabeth Hitler. Good, now I sign your contract. Excellent, excellent. Oh, here we are. Right here on the dotted line. There you are. You shall never regret this. So, thank you, Herr Liebkind. Alrighty then. - Thank you. - Very good. Let it go, let it go. Halt! I forgot to tell you. The penalty for breaking the Siegfried Oath is death. Dess? Is that anything like death? Yes. Sorry to hear that. Don't worry. We'll iron out all these thorny details over strudel. Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go. We're trapped, trapped. Got it. Let's have lunch. What nice guys. Broadway. I haven't been so happy since we crushed Poland. Hello, the living room of renowned theatrical director, Roger De Bris' elegant upper-east side town house on a sunny, Tuesday afternoon in June. Who may I say is calling? Listen, you broken-down old queen, he was drunk, he was hot, you got lucky. Don't ever call here again. - Who was that? - Wrong number. Yes? Well, hi, there. I am Max Bialystock and this is my associate Mr. Bloom. We have an appointment with renowned theatrical director Roger De Bris. Yes, yes, please come in. Please. - Thank you. - Yes. I am Carmen Ghia. Mr. De Bris' common-law assistant. You are expected. May I take your hat, your coat and your swastikas? Oh, these... We just came from this big rally. Everybody was wearing them. Why didn't you tell me we still had those on? I didn't notice them. You told me to look straight ahead, - you remember that? - All right, let's not fight, okay? Oh, Roger... We're not alone. Here's Roger. Max, he's wearing a dress. No kidding. Oh, Roger, good to see you again. Messieurs Bialystock and Bloom, I presume? Forgive the pun. - What pun? - Shut up, he thinks he's witty. Roger, may I say, you look gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. By the way, Max, darling, we loved Funny Boy, didn't we, Carmen? Oh, worshipped it. To be or not to be you mean a lot to me - Show stopper. - Fabulous. Oh, dear, your Mr. Bloom is staring at my gown. Oh, well, I... I should explain. I'm going to the choreographer's ball this evening. There is a prize for best costume. We always win. I'm not so sure about this year. I'm supposed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. But I think I look more like the Chrysler Building. Well, as far as I'm concerned, without your wig on, you're only half-dressed. Well, then, why don't you go and get it, oh, Wicked Witch of the West? If your intention was to shoot an arrow through my heart... Bull's-eye! Oh, Roger, let's face it. That building is you. Listen, I know we sent it to you only this morning, but, did you get a chance yet to read Springtime for Hitler? Read it? I devoured it. And I find it remarkable. Remarkable! I feel it is a very important piece drenched with historical goodies. I, for one, for instance, never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany. Yeah, how about that? Then you'll do it? Do it? Of course not. It's not my kind of thing. I mean, Max, please, World War II, too dark, too depressing. The theater's so obsessed with drama so depressed It's hard to sell a ticket on Broadway Shows should be more pretty Shows should be more witty Shows should be more What's the word? - Gay? - Exactly. No matter what you do on the stage Keep it light, keep it bright, keep it gay Whether it's murder, mayhem or rage Don't complain, it's a pain Keep it gay People want laughter when they see a show The last thing they're after is a litany of woe A happy ending will pep up your play Oedipus won't bomb If he winds up with Mom - Keep it gay - Keep it gay Keep it gay Couldn't agree more and you have our blessings, Roger to make Springtime for Hitler just as gay as anyone could possibly want. So, come on, do it for us, please. I'm sorry, Max, it's simply not my cup of tea. Still, fair is fair. Perhaps I should ask my production team what they think. - Your production team, who are they? - You'll see. They all live here. Guys, come say "Hello" to Bialystock and Bloom. - This is my set designer, Bryan. - Hello. Keep it mad keep it glad, keep it gay - Here's my costume designer, Kevin. - Hello. Keep it happy keep it snappy, keep it gay We're clever, creative it's ourjob to see That everything's perfect for Mr. De Bris - Scott, my choreographer. - Hi, there. And now finally, last and least, my lighting designer, Shirley Markowitz. Keep it gay, keep it gay Keep it gay Now, they all just read Springtime. What did you think of it, fellows? - It needs glamour - And glitz - It needs sequins - And tits Leo, Leo, I think we're losing them. Go say something nice to Roger. I think he likes you. - But, Max... - Go on, it's just showbiz. Mr. De Bris? Roger? Roger, actually, I think your gown is very stunning. Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom. Leo. Mmm. What is that enchanting cologne you're wearing? Me? I'm not wearing any cologne. You mean that smell is you? Oh, God. If I could bottle you, I'd shove you under my armpits every day. Oh, Max. Max, we never should have started this. I think we're getting in too deep. Too deep? This is nothing. I'll tell you when we're getting in too deep. And, so, the rule is when mounting a play Keep it funny keep it sunny, keep it gay - What should we do? - Relax. Watch this. Roger... I think that Springtime for Hitler would be a marvelous opportunity for you. I mean, up to now, you've always been associated with... Dare I say it, frivolous musicals. You're right. I've often felt as though I've been throwing my life away on silly entertainments. Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns. "Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn, kick, turn..." - Roger. - It's enough to make you heave. Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max. I just couldn't do Springtime for Hitler. - Why not? Think of the respect. - No. - Think of the prestige. - No, no, no. Think of the Tony. Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony - What's the matter? - Is he all right? - He's having a stroke... - What? of genius! I see it at last The chance to do something important Roger De Bris presents history Of course that whole second act has to be re-written. They're losing the war? Excuse me? That's too down beat. Roger De Bris presents history But maybe... It's a wild idea, but it just might work. I see A line Of beautiful girl Dressed as storm troopers Each one a gem With leather boots and whips on their hip It's risque, dare I say, S and M Love it! I see German soldiers dancing through fans Played by chorus boys in very tight pants And wait, there's more They win the war And the dances they do will be daring and new Turn, turn, kick, turn, turn, kick turn, one, two, three, kick, turn Keep it sassy keep it classy, keep it That is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself, Roger, when I say that you are the only man in the world who can do justice to Springtime for Hitler. - Will you do it, please? - Please? Wait a minute. This is a very big decision. It might affect the course of my entire life. I shall have to think about it. I'll do it. I'll do it Sabu, champagne! If at the end you want them to cheer Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it gay Whether it's Hamlet, Othello or Lear Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it gay Comedy's joyous, a constant delight Dramas annoy us And ruin our night So keep your Strindbergs and Ibsens at bay I'll sign - Sign - Sign Sign Sign Sign Roger Elizabeth De Bris Keep it gay! Conga! So the rule is when mounting a play Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it gay! Exclusive Broadway rights to the worst show ever written and a signed contract with the worst director who ever lived. We're in business. And what a business. In the same day, I'm taking the Siegfried Oath and dancing the conga, with a cop, a sailor and an extremely friendly Cherokee Indian. Yeah. Oh, well. It's not easy being a Broadway producer... - Nope. - but together we'll make it. Partners, Leo. Partners all the way and nothing or no one will ever come between us. Nothing or no one, Max. Come in. Bialystock and Bloom? What? Oh, excuse me... Swedish. - Costing today? - Costing. - Costing? - Costing? - Casting. - Casting. Oh, no, no, miss, we're not casting yet. You see, we don't even know when we're beginning... Casting, yes, we just started casting today. - Yes, yes. - We're casting? Yes, we're casting. If you don't mind, just once in my life, I'd like to see somebody on that couch who's under 85. What's your name, my dear? My name is Ulla Inga... Hansen Benson Yansen Tallen Hallen Svaden Swanson. Oh, wait, wait, what's your first name? That was my first name. You want to hear my last name? We don't have the time. We'll just call you Ulla. Okay? Yeah. What do you do, Ulla? - Ulla sing and dance. - Oh, yeah? - You want Ulla make audition? - Oh, no, miss. - That won't be nece... - Yes, it is nece. Extremely nece. Please, please make audition. Make audition all over the office. What are you going to sing? Well, yesterday, when I was stepping out of a big, white Rolls-Royce limo, a crazy man yelled something out the window that inspired me to write this song. When you got it Flaunt it Step right up and strut your stuff People tell you modesty's a virtue But in the theater modesty can hurt you When you got it Flaunt it Show your assets let them know you're proud Your goodies you must push Stick your chest out, shake your tush When you got it, shout it out loud Now Ulla dance. When you got it, show it Put your hidden treasures on display Violinists love to play an E-string But audiences really love a g-string When you got it, shout it Let the whole world hear what you're about Clothes may make the man All a girl needs is a tan When you got it, let it hang out Remember when Ulla dance? Yeah. Ulla dance again. Ulla dance again. When I was just a little girl in Sweden My thoughtful mother gave me this advice If nature blesses you from top to bottom Show that top to bottom Don't think twice Now Ulla belt. Don't think twice When you got it, share it Let the public feast upon your charms People say that being prim is proper But every showgirl knows that prim will stop her When you got it, give it Don't be selfish, give it all away Don't be shy, be bold and cute Show the boys your birthday suit When you got it If you got it Once you got it Shout out Hooray Okey dokey, you like it? Like it? I want you to know, my dear, that even though we're sitting down, we are giving you a standing ovation. She's in the show. Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know if there's a part for her in the show. Would you excuse us, my dear? Nonsense, Bloom. Bloom, do I have to teach you everything? There is always a part in the show for the producer's girlfriend. But, Max, we don't even know when we're starting rehearsal, yet. So what? So what? We're producers, aren't we? So, until she goes into the show, she can work for us here. Because, we need, nay, deserve to have ourselves... Deserve to have ourselves, a gorgeous Swedish secretary/receptionist. But, Max, a secretary who doesn't speak English? - What will people say? - They'll say... Offer her the job, please. Just a moment, miss. We might have a position for you. As a matter of fact, we might have several positions for you. Until the show gets going, we can offer you a job here as a secretary/receptionist. Secretary/receptionist? Okey-slash-dokey. I can do that. Answer telephone. Bialystock and Bloom. - Bialystock and Bloom. - Smart as a whip. You're hired! Well, all right. If he says so, I don't have any... Oh, yeah. Secretary/receptionist and... Maybe you can tidy up around here a little bit, too. Tidy up? Tidy up. Such a funny word. - What means "tidy up?" - Oh, you know, clean? Make look nice. Oh, yeah! Ulla can make "tidy up." Oh, very good. What time can you be here in the morning? Well, Ulla wake up every morning, 5:00 a.m. From 5:00 to 7:00 Ulla like to exercise. From 7:00 to 8:00 Ulla like to take a long shower. From 8:00 to 9:00, Ulla like to have big Swedish breakfast. Many different herrings. From 9:00 to 11:00... Ulla like to practice her singing and her dancing. And at 11:00, Ulla like to have sex. What time should I get here? - 11:00. - Good! Ulla will come at 11:00. "Ulla will come at 11:00." God bless America. God bless Sweden. Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I've never felt this way before. It's like a volcano erupting inside of me, like, like hot lava rising higher and higher and... What is that, Max? What is it? It's called an erection. It's either that or malaria. But don't worry, they have shots for everything now. Come here, I want to show you something. - What do you see? - Nothing. Exactly. But now that we've got our sure-fire flop, it's gonna be our job to fill that safe with $2 million. $2 million? Gee, how much do we put in? How much... How much do we put in? Bloom, the two cardinal rules of being a Broadway producer are, one... Never put your own money in the show. And two? Never put your own money in the show! - Get it? - Got it. Good. - So how do we raise the money? - How? I'll tell you how. From my investors. Hundreds of little old ladies all looking to Max Bialystock for one last thrill on their way to the cemetery. So, in the days to come, Bloom, you shall see very little of me. And right now I'd like to see very little of you. Scram, while I get myself ready. For Max Bialystock, is about to launch himself into Little-old-lady Land. The time has come To be a lover from the Argentine To slick my hair down with brilliantine And gargle heavily with Lister Ine Wow! It's time for Max To put his backers on their backs And thrill them with Amazing acts Those aging nymphomaniacs They were helpless, they were hopeless Then along came Bialy They were joyless, they were boyless Then along came Bialy They're my angels, I'm their devil And I keep those embers aglow When I woos 'em, I can't lose 'em 'Cause I cast my spell and they start yelling, "Fire down below" So romantic, they were frantic Then their prayers were heard up above Heaven sent them their Bialy I'm the celebration Of love Who is it? Who is it? - It's Max Bialystock! - Oh! Maxy. Fire down below! We were listing, we were sinking Then along came Bialy We were desperate, we were drinking Then along came Bialy Who's your daddy? So romantic, we were frantic Then our prayers were heard up above He's Bialy, hey, Bialy He's the culmination The restoration The consummation The titillation Ejaculation He's a celebration of love Bloom! Bloom! What, Max? What? I've done it. I've done it. I've raised the $2 million! Now all we have to do is put on the biggest flop in history. That's great! - Yeah. - We can't miss. Gotta make the next payment on the theater by 3:00 or else... Oh! Sorry, wrong office. Bialystock, Bloom. Max, Leo. - Ulla? - Ja. - What happened to the office? - Like you tell Ulla - "tidy up." - "Tidy oop?" Well. How did you find the time to do all this? I skip lunch. Of course you did. - Very nice. - She skipped lunch. - Oh. - Yeah. Almost three. That payment to the Shubert's. I'll get the cash from the safe. You make sure all those contracts are signed. Yes, Max. Oh, she painted over the numbers. Hello, boys. Nobody knows what I went through to get you. Ulla knows. You had to schtup every little old lady in New York. That's right. That's right. And I've still got the denture bites to prove it. Work, work, work. Work, work, work. Work, work, work. So... Mr. Bloom. We are all alone. Yes we are. Aren't we? Why Bloom go so far camera right? Bloom no like Ulla? - Ulla like Bloom. - Oh. Oh, Bloom like Ulla, all right. - Maybe a little too much. - Good. I'm glad. - Why Bloom need blue blanket? - Oh, it's not important. It's just a minor compulsion. It's that I've... I've had it ever since I was a baby and I... You're a little too close. The urge to merge can rob us of our senses The need to breed can make a man a drone We must be on alert with our defenses For every skirt will test Testosterone So knowing this I severed all connection With any creature sporting silk or lace I was firmly headed in the right direction When suddenly I stumbled on That face That face, that face, that dangerous face I mustn't be unwise Those lips, that nose, those eyes Could lead to my demise That face, that face, that marvelous face I never should begin Those cheeks, that neck, that chin Will surely do me in I must be smart and hide my heart if she's within a mile If I don't duck, I'm out of luck She'd kill me with her smile That face, that face, that fabulous face It's clear I must beware I'm certain if I fall in love I'm lost without a trace But it's worth it for that face Oh-oh, Bloom help Ulla down? All right, Bloom help Ulla down. That face, that face That lovable face It melts my Swedish heart I'm certain if I fall in love I'm lost without a trace But it's worth it For that Face Again!

Oh, you look so handsome. - Oh, thank you. - This is so exciting. Leo! Leo. - Who said you could wear that hat? - Well, nobody, Max, but I thought now that I'm the producer of a Broadway show... - Has the curtain gone up yet? - No. - Has the curtain come down yet? - No. - Then you're not a producer yet. - Give me that hat. Mr. Bloom! Leo. - Your tie is all askew. - Askew? Well, thank you, Ulla. Have a good show. Roll them in the aisles. Okey-dokey. I will try to. But there's just so many of them. Gee, I thought we were partners sharing everything fifty-fifty. Now, I'm out in the cold and you two are busy askewing each other. Askewing? Never, Max. Hugs and kisses, yes, but that's as far as I go. Gunter, you will pick me up back here right after the curtain. Oh, God, will they love us, will they hate us? - The suspense is killing me. - I know. I feel like I'm going into labor. Messieurs Bialystock and Bloom. Well, gentlemen, merde. And I just wanna wish everybody good luck. - What? What did you say? - Bite your tongue. - Gott im Himmel! - Oh, what's the matter... - All I said was good luck. - He said it again. Mr. Bloom, hasn't anyone ever told you it's bad luck to say, "good luck" on opening night? If you do, I tell you It is certain by the curtain You are through Good luck! It's bad luck to say "Good luck" on opening night Once it's said, you are dead You will get the worst reviews you ever read Good luck! Even at the Comedie Francaise On the opening night they are scared "Bonne chance, mes amis," no one says The only word you'll ever hear is Merde Good luck, good luck, good luck! It's verboten, wishing luck on opening night Take advice, don't think twice Or your show will surely end up in the scheiss At the famous La Scala in Milan On opening night it's a rule "In bocca lupo" they say with elan And just for luck they all shout "Vafangu" I got it Now I'll never say "good luck" on opening night That's the rule, I'm no fool What do I say, I beg? What you say is "break a leg" - Break a leg? - Yes, break a leg! If you're clever Good luck! You'll endeavor To never, never, never, never ever, ever, ever say On opening night Five minutes to curtain. Curtain going up in five minutes. Hasenpfeffer. I'm late. I must run. Break a leg! Kaiser! Franz, what happened? I broke my leg. Now we'll have to cancel the show and give everyone their money back. Money back? Money back? Money back? Don't ever say that again. Money back! Never. We got to think of something else. But Franz plays Hitler, Max, and he has no understudy. You're right. What are we gonna do? There must be some way out. If I could only think of something. Some way, some... Hold it. I got it. Roger, you, you could play Hitler. You know every line in the show. I've seen you at rehearsal, always moving your lips along with the actors. I know. It's an embarrassing habit I'm trying to break myself of it. But me play Hitler, no! No, there's no way I could go on tonight. I don't have the strength, I don't have the courage. I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it! - Wow, that hurt. - Roger, listen to me. You can do it. You know you can do it and I know you can do it. You've been waiting all your lifetime for this chance and I'm not gonna let you pass it up. You're going out there a silly hysterical screaming queen, but you're coming back a great big, passing-for-straight, Broadway star. All right. You're right. I'll do it. By God, I'll do it! I've got to get into makeup. Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache. And, oh, my lucky Gloria Swanson mole. Got it! Leo, the overture. Let's go! - Max. - What? This is it! - Good luck, Leo. - Good luck, Max. Germany was having trouble What a sad, sad story Needed a new leader to restore its former glory Where, oh, where was he? Where could that man be?

I'm turning myself in. It's the only way. I'm going to play ball with the IRS. I'm going to cooperate with the authorities. They'll reduce my sentence, then there's time off for good behavior. Maybe I'll get a good job in the prison library. Please keep in touch. It's been very nice working with you. Leo. Leo. Leo. Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax, take it easy. All right? You're overwrought. You don't know what you're doing. You're acting out of panic. Give me those freaking books! Give me! Give me! I never should have listened to you!

What are you doing, you neo-Nazi nitwit? - Your show's a hit! - Who cares? - You made a fool out of Hitler! - He didn't need our help. Stand still! How can I shoot you if you keep moving? - Get back here! - Under the desk! Under the desk! - Darling, quick, back in the closet. - Okay. This is no good. I'm not killing anybody. You must cooperate! All right, Bialystock und Bloom. Now I got you. Say your prayers! Remember I told you, I'd tell you when we're in too deep? - Yeah? - We're in too deep. - Auf Wiedersehen. - Franz, don't do it, please. - I beg you. No. - No. You sniveling cowards! Cringing under a desk! Clinging to life like baby butterflies. Franz Liebkind will show you how to die like a man! It's jammed. Boy, when things go wrong... That's it! Next time, no author. What are you shooting at us for, anyway? You Teutonic twit! Wait. Wait a minute. I just got an idea. A way to close the show! Franz. - There, there. - Where? Where? Franz, listen to me. Why don't you use this where it'll do some good? - Why don't you shoot the actors? - The actors? Yes, the actors! Everybody laughed at your beloved Fuehrer tonight. And why? Because of the actors. The actors were making fun of him. - Yeah, you're right. The actors! - Yes. Here, go, buy bullets. - Kill. Kill all the actors. - I must kill all the actors. - Yeah. - Wait a minute. What are you talking about? What do you mean, kill the actors? You can't kill the actors. Actors are not animals. - They're human beings. - They are? Have you ever eaten with one? Here, listen... - Open up, it's the police. - The police! I said open up that door. - Come on, boys! - I was never a member of the Nazi party. I had nothing to do... You, drop that gun.

Youse two can go. - Thank you. Tried to kill him, eh? Officer O'Rourke, take this man in. Next stop, Sing Sing. Sing Sing. Nein. You'll never take me alive. What happened? I broke my other leg. All right, who are you? And why was he trying to shoot you? I haven't the slightest idea, Sergeant O'Toole. The name is O'Bialystock. I was just passing by on me way to the Pat O'Brien film festival and I ducked in to see what the hell was going on. And now I'll be on me way before me voice gets any higher. As we say in the old country, "Taxi." Hold it! - Hey, Sarge, look at this. - What? I found these two accounting books. This one says, "Show to the IRS." - And what's the other one say? - "Never show to the IRS." I think the three of you better come downtown with me. - Three? - Yeah. You and them two books. Mr. Bialystock? Mr. Bloom? Where are you? Everyone is waiting for you at the opening night party. Ulla, help me. What happened to you? I know. You hung up your coat while you were still in it. Thank you for helping me down. - What were you doing up there? - Hiding. - I was hiding. - From who? From what? From the police. They were just here. They've arrested Max. - They found the books. - I don't know what to do. Poor Max. Maybe I should turn myself in and go to jail with him. Well, my sweet cupcake, I know we both love Max. But, it seems to me you have two choices. Number one, you can go to jail with Mr. Bialystock for years and years and years. Or, number two, you can take that $2 million and Ulla and go to Rio. Oh, my God. What a dilemma. Oh, what should I do? Should I go to jail or go to Rio? Mail call. Hey, fatso. - I'm not that fat! - Says you. You got a postcard. - A postcard. From where? - Brazil. Brazil. Who do I know in Brazil? Why am I asking you? "Dear Max, Rio was everything you said it was and more. "Ulla and I think of you every chance we get. "In the morning, when we have breakfast on our terrace. "Many different herrings. "In the afternoon, when we rub each others sun-drenched bodies "with banana cream coconut oil. "Number 15. "And then in the evening "when we samba together in the moonlight." You'll find your happiness in Rio The beaches there are strewn with pearls The tropic breezes always blow there And, so we hear, do the girls "Sorry, must run. Ulla's waiting. "It's almost 11:00. "Wish you were here. Your pal, "Leo." Just like Cain and Abel You pulled a sneak attack I thought that we were brothers Then you stabbed me in the back Betrayed Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed Like Samson and Delilah Your love began to fade I'm crying in the hoosegow, You're in Rio getting laid Betrayed! Let's face it, I'm betrayed Boy Have I been taken I'm so forsaken I should have seen what came to pass I should have known to watch my ass I feel like Othello Everything is lost Leo is Iago, Max is double-crossed I'm so dismayed Did I mention I'm betrayed? Now I'm about to go to jail There's no one who will pay my bail I have no one who I can cry to No one I can say goodbye to I'm drowning. I'm drowning. I'm drowning here. I'm going down for the last time. I see my whole life flashing before my eyes. I see a weathered old farmhouse with a white picket fence. I'm running through fields of alfalfa with my collie, Rex. No, Rex, not on the alfalfa. And, I see my mother. I see Mama standing on the back porch in a worn but clean gingham gown. And I hear my mama calling out to me. Alvin! Don't forget your chores. The wood needs a-cording and the cows need a-milking! Alvin! Alvin! Wait a minute. My name's not Alvin. That's not my life. Somebody else's life is flashing before my eyes. What the hell is that about? I'm not a hillbilly. I grew up in the Bronx. Leo's taken everything. Even my past. My past's a dying ember But wait, now I remember How did it begin? He walked into my office With his cockamamie scheme "You can make more money With a flop than with a hit" We can do it, we can do it "I can't do it" We can do it! "I can't do it" "Goodbye, Max." Lord, I want that money! "I'm back, Max" Come on, Leo, we can do it Step one, find the play See it, smell it, touch it, kiss it Hello, Mister Liebkind Guten Tag hop hop Guten Tag clop clop Adolf Elizabeth Hitler?

Along came Bialy Step four, hire all the actors! A wandering minstrel, I A thing of shreds and Next! The Little Wooden Boy Next! That's our Hitler Break a leg! "I broke my leg." Springtime for Hitler and Germany A surprise smash Springtime for Hitler and Germany It'll run for years Where did we go right? Give me those books Fat, fat, fatty Books, fat, books, fat Books, fat, books, fat Lousy fruit, kill the actors You ever eat with one? Then you ran to Rio and you're safely out of reach I'm behind these bars You're banging Ulla on the beach! Just like Julius Caesar Was betrayed by Brutus Who'd think an accountant would turn out to be my Judas I'm so dismayed Is this how I'm repaid? To be Betrayed Betrayed Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached your verdict? Yes, Your Honor, we have. We find the defendant incredibly guilty. No. Hold me, touch me. I'm a little busy. Does the defendant have anything to say on his own behalf? Yes, Your Honor, I do. I admit for the last 20 years I've been a lying, double-crossing, two-faced backstabbing, despicable crook. But I had no choice. I was a Broadway producer. A man without a conscience, and with no one who gave a damn about him. And that Your Honor, is what hurts the most. I thought I'd at last found a loyal partner. A man I cared about, and, who I thought cared about me. And what breaks my heart, is that now when I need him most, he's deserted me. And I will probably never see or hear from him ever again. That's not true! Order! Order in the court! And stop that samba! - Who are you? - I am Leopold Bloom. Max Bialystock's partner. And who are you my dear? My name is Ulla Inga Hansen Benson Yansen... Tallen Hallen Svaden Swanson... - Bloom. - Bloom? - You're his wife? - Ja, Your Honor. He wouldn't do it unless we got married. What a schmuck. Now, Mr. Bloom, why in the world would you want to come back here - and give yourself up? - Why? To speak on his behalf. We all know that Max Bialystock is a lying, double-crossing two-faced, slimy, manipulative - under-handed... - Please, don't help me. Your Honor, Your Honor, if I may address the court. The law was created to protect people from being wronged. So whom has Max Bialystock wronged? - Well, not these dear ladies. - No. No, and not me. Not... Not me. I was this nobody. No one ever called me Leo before... I mean, your Honor, I know it isn't a big legal point, but even when I was in kindergarten, everybody always called me Bloom. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, even when I was in Rio and had everything I'd ever dreamed of, I suddenly realized that this man... This man... No one ever made me feel like someone Till him Life was really nothing but a glum one Till him My existence bordered on the tragic Always timid, never took a chance Then I felt his magic And my heart began to dance I was always frightened, fraught with worry Till him I was going nowhere in a hurry Till him He filled up my empty life Filled it to the brim There could never ever be Another one Like him Leo. Leo, I never realized, you're a good singer. Thank you. No, really, like a professional. Well, I sang it for you, Max. I sang it because I'm your friend. You are? I've had a lot of relationships, but... You couldn't call any of them friend. But come to think of it, no one ever, ever really knew me. Till him Everyone was always out to screw me Till him Never met a man I ever trusted Always dealt with shysters in the past Now I'm well adjusted 'cause I've got a friend At last Don't help me. Always playing singles never doubles Till him Never had a pal to share my troubles Till him He filled up my empty life Filled it to the brim There could never ever be Another one Like him Gentlemen, it breaks my heart to break up such a beautiful friendship, so I won't.
