SATAN SAID: "I AM BETTER THAN HIM. YOU CREATED ME FROM FIRE AND CREATED HIM FROM CLAY." "REPRIEVE ME UNTIL THE DAY THEY ARE RESURRECTED." SOUL Mum. When can we slaughter another one, mum? Why don't you pick up the charcoals first? They're still hot, mum. Can I choose which one for today? You're such a... Enough. Get Along. Go check on the trap. Can we? Angah. Along. - Keep an eye on your brother. - Alright, mum. Along, this is enough for a week. Don't speak of it. Let's go. Along! Along... Remember what mum said. Keep your head down. Quick. Mum! Wait here. Angah. Didn't I say pick up the charcoals earlier on? Child, where are you from? What's your name? Little girl, I'll fetch you some water. She's probably from the village across the river. Got lost in the forest. - I think... - She's probably mute, mum. Mum, let me clean her up. Let's bring her to the village across the river. Maybe the villagers know her. What's up with you? Mum. This noon at the trap we saw a deer. Dead. Hung by a tree. And then? What did you guys do? I wanted to bring the deer home. - Should last us a week. - Are you crazy? It's already dead, hanging by the tree. A tiger might be lurking around. Hey, don't simply take anything in the jungle. Listen well. Never believe everything that you see or hear... in the jungle. - If dad was around, he'd have... - And then? Is he here right now? Anyway, there's no tiger in this jungle. There're only crocodiles and lizards. Mum, crocodiles and lizards don't climb trees. You're right. Or could be... this is something else. Something old people always talk about... related to deer. They say... It likes to roam around the jungle with Its ghostly dogs. Whoever sees It will fall ill... or die. What's this "something", mum? It swore a solemn oath to not return home until It got what It hunted for. Day and night It hunted, slaying innumerable creatures especially... deers and children. It threw away the unfavourable ones. Until one day... the jungle put a spell on It. So It became a regular denizen of the jungle or some people called It... the ghost hunter. It eats flesh and drinks blood. To this day, It's still hunting. So, the deer might be... When you hear dogs barking... or the sound of nightjars flying in flock at night you'll know that It's nearby. So when It's nearby, pick up two stones knock them while calling out "Grandpa, bring us their hearts" "Grandpa, bring us their hearts" Why must we say that, mum? You must play Its game, asking for what It's hunted so that It believes that you're Its follower. Mum. What do the nightjars sound like? What? So... the deer... This means It's nearby? It's simple. Find two stones and then... It's here. Mum! When the moon is full, all of you will die. What do we do now, mum? Excuse me. I was just passing by. Look. These stones look strange. That's why I stopped by to take a look. No idea. They fell down last night. Where are you from? I'm from the other side of the river. I come here to collect plants in the swamp. I hope you don't mind. We don't mind at all. You should inform your husband too. There are only three of us. You can call me Tok. I hope you won't mind what I'm about to tell you. I know a few things. Look. These stones are bad omens. They often mean bad things will happen soon. - I think... - Stay for a while. Have some coffee or tea? Nevermind. I have to go. Next time, maybe. Why don't the two of you go pick these stones and throw them away? Come on. Go. I have some advice. If there's anything amiss anything come look for me. I live on that hill. Along. Full moon is due in a couple of days, right? Yes. Why? Why? Didn't you hear what the little girl said just now? That's nonsense. Who knows what happened to her when she was lost in the jungle. I shouldn't have greeted her that day. It wasn't that. Along. Last night, I think I saw... What happened to that girl wasn't our fault. So, keep in mind, don't mention this to anyone. Along? Mum, where are you going? Along is too feverish. I will look for Tok. Along? We live too far to ask for others' help. We need to ward off her misfortune. It might be just a disease but who knows? Things like this can't be taken lightly. Something evil has entered this area. Go home and take a look at your daughter. Take this. Throw it faraway into the water. And these doves, do as I've told you. Understand? You don't have to stay on that hill. Don't worry. I'm used to it already. We don't have guests often. It'll be nice to have another adult around as company. I only have these kids. What a pain in the neck. Do you miss Dad? Do you think Dad will ever come back? I don't know. I just hope he'll come back soon. Me too. If Dad was around, Mum wouldn't be as cranky as she is now. Listen here. I've some advice to give you. Hey, it's okay. It's late. I have to go. Alright. When you feel like visiting, just stop by anytime. Grandpa, bring us their hearts... Have you seen a girl? About his height. No, we didn't. Are you sure? No one came by. Try looking around in the village across the river. I came from there. There's no other kid except my children. Look for her somewhere else! Mum. Don't you think that guy looks like a hunter? He even has a spear. Looks like he just returned from war. Filthy. Ill-mannered. Something isn't right about that stranger. What do you mean? Exactly. Why was he looking for the girl? That's why. Perhaps the girl was running away from him. Who knows? I was only asking. He might be her father. Many strange things happened since the girl's arrival. And now, this stranger. Maybe he's the cause. We're now living in a dangerous time. Many people are desperate and feel unsafe. Angah! Angah... Angah! Along? Along? Along! Along! Along! What happened to Along? Along went missing. She wasn't there when we woke up this morning. I can sense there's a stranger around here. - A man? - Yes. He stopped by our house yesterday. Why? What did he want? He asked whether we've seen a little girl. A little girl? So have you seen her? Along fell ill yesterday and she went missing today. I think it's related to him. I'm not sure. I'm going there. I'll try to look for Along along the way. Along? Where did you go? What happened to you? I found her in the jungle. Fool! Don't try to fool me! What've you done to my daughter? - I'll slit your throat with this machete! - Ask her yourself! Where did you get this dagger? So it's true that the little girl was here. - I told you there was no one here. - Don't you dare lie to me! Yes, she was here. - Along! - She followed us home. Mum took her in. Mum gave her food. - Along! - Mister. Let me take you... to where she is. - Please leave my family alone. - Shut up, Angah! This boy will take me to her. After seeing the little girl, I'll leave this place. It's okay, mum. I'm here. Let Angah take him to her. Along. Many things had happened. We didn't know what to do. There's an open field with a big dead tree in the middle. She's there. Are you sure it wasn't him? Let's just leave this place. Where? To the village across the river? It'll take us a day to get there. With your condition like this? What condition should I be... before we can leave, mum? We must bring the charcoals with us, Along. You know that too. We have nothing. Tell me, mum. When was the last time you prostrated and asked for help? Are you still expecting for your dead husband to return and help? Or... are you waiting for me to prostrate for you, fool? Why don't you just die, useless mother! Tok. Did you find your sister? Be patient, child. We all belong to Him. Tok. There's something wrong around here. Something that we can't see and it's evil! There's always something evil around us. You don't have to be afraid. The things that you can't see or hold... have no power over you. It can only hurt you through humans. The stranger... So, remember. Don't trust others too much. Run! So it's true that you saw that little girl. Where is the body? We left it at the open field. Hopefully someone else sees it. I don't want my kids to... Angah already showed the stranger where the body is. He was the one who found Along. - We should help him in return. - Help? Did he say where he came from? Did he? He said from the village across the river. Do you know what happened in that village? What? All the houses were burnt down to the ground. There's nothing left. What happened exactly? Why did the little girl run away? The little girl didn't run away. You should already know by now that she's not an ordinary child. So who's that stranger? What should we do? Things are getting complicated. Humans thrive and perish along with nature. And now, the stranger has the body back. We can never know what will happen next. Mum! Help me. I need to ask for something. Angah? Have you packed the charcoals? Just take what we have. There's still a bit more. Hurry up, we don't have much time, Angah! I'm hungry. Can we eat first? Go now and do as I said! Angah? Angah? Angah! Angah? Angah! You said you would leave this place. You found the little girl. What are you still doing here? I'm here to look for your son. What do you want from my son? Who are you exactly? Please don't get me wrong. Don't you dare lie to me. We don't have much time. Things will worsen. Worsen? What's worse than having my dead daughter's body in the house while my son went missing? Listen here! You must believe me if you want to stay safe. - Or else... - Or else what? Please believe me. Didn't I find your lost daughter in the jungle? Was it really you who found her? Don't you lie to her! You must leave this place. Don't believe... Why don't you leave this place peacefully? This woman! You should leave now if you want to be safe. Fine. I'll find your son myself. I think... you need this spear more than me. I don't understand. Don't go. You can't fight him. You'd better wait here. Believe me. I must find Angah before he does. Let me do it instead. Look after your daughter. We don't know what he's done to the girl's body. Better if I kill him. Wait here. I've killed the boy. You're willing to sacrifice his life. Did you take a good look at his face... when you killed him? Didn't you pity him? He was possessed. I couldn't save him. Same as my daughter. She's done her part. This body is for the next child. It's the child's turn now. Let me ask you again. What did you really see... when you slit his throat? It's easy to fool humans. You were given so many signs. You could've saved that family. But all you thought about was your daughter. You were selfish. So, why must I prostrate... to humans like you? "Humans"? What do you mean? Who are you exactly? You don't need to know who we are. "We"? It was you! You deceived me with your tricks! All we need to do is whisper. And you obeyed our whispers. You're more powerful! You know that we've no power over you unless it's His will. What else will you do to my daughter? This is just a body... that will rot and become clay. Endless revenge! You're willing to damn yourself because of clay! Your time has passed. Don't regret the past, for it's over... or be intoxicated with the ephemeral present. Ephemerality belongs to us. But the next life... will be as eternal... as your soul. Where do you think... your soul will go? Will your soul... rise like fire that reaches the heavens... or will your soul fall like ashes... that scatter over the ground?
