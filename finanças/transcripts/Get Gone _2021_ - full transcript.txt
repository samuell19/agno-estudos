It's no secret I've been away for awhile. Why'd I come back? I guess it was now or never. This is my estate. There's many others like it. But this... this one's mine. Was mine. He was only 18. You knew him? Nice kid. He'd always say hi. He always helped Martha at number four carry her shopping up the road. You know him? He was my brother. Oh um... I'm really sorry for your loss. Cuzzy, yes, cuzzy. What's going on man? What you sayin'? You good, yeah? It's been three years, man. Trust me man I know. Look at you mate. Is this dickhead bothering ya? Why you gotta be like that, Ryan? He was saying he knew Tom? Yeah, yeah. PC Dickhead over here knows everyone doesn't he? Always sticking his nose in where it ain't wanted. I'm just trying to do my job. Job? You're a Special Constable which means you're trying to be a police officer which then makes you an even bigger dickhead. You need to be careful how you speak to me. Oi! Fuck off! Little shits. Dickhead. Do you wanna see where we buried Tom? No. I had a bit of bother with the damp a few months back. Council are getting it done but it takes them so long to fix it. You are still staying here, aren't you like we agreed? Yeah, Nana. I've missed you. I miss our Tom. You could have talked to him. You could have made him understand about that bad stuff. Our Tom was no addict, Nana. Why didn't he, why didn't he talk to someone? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, cuz. I shoulda watched him. I shoulda kept him closer to me. I fucked up. I'm sorry cuz. I shoulda looked out for our little cousin man. That's all. You don't get respect by being a bully. But you fight. You always knocked mans out. Look, I want you to be able look after yourself not cause trouble. You understand me? Yes, Eddie. Old man Eddie. Still about. Are they Tom's? Yeah. Sent 'em for his 17th. You know, he never took 'em off. Yeah? Yeah. Tom was trying a few things. A little bit of weed, couple of Es. Know, he wasn't a kid anymore. Not like you remember anyway. Yeah, I get that. But heroin? They said he was injecting it. It was a first hit gone wrong. Where'd he even get it from? No one knows. Yeah, well that's some bullshit. Tom was no wrongen man, no way. No fucking way. What about you? You still making moves? Shane's let me in. Well, you gonna tell me not to? Just watch yourself with Shane. I got a couple errands to run init so... Got a couple of errands to run of my own. I'm sorry for Tom. Did you miss me? Actually don't answer that. I couldn't give a shit. Yeah, you could. And yeah... I did. Why are you here? Came back to see Nana. So why are you here? Wanted to see if you'd put any weight on. If you had, I'd have snuck back out. Dickhead. Do they give you a day pass to this place? I've been coaching here part-time. Girls around here need a little more direction besides getting knocked up, knocked around. Hello. He is. Sounds good. I'm a little sweaty but it's cool. All right. Let me guess. Ryan trying to arrange a surprise drink. He's making an effort. I'll go get my things. Focus! You need to hit through the pad. Go through it. Where's your head at? I'm hitting 'em as hard as I can. Then hit harder! I can't. What? If I ever hear "I can't" again, I'm gonna rip your fucking head off! Now, hit em! Faster! Faster! Faster! Are you ready? Yeah. Yeah. Here he is. Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Walker. My big brother is back. You good, man? I hadn't seen these faces in three years. To be honest, I didn't give a shit. Their stories are still the same. Come on, mate, come to the bar, let's get a drink. They were still dabbling in this, that, and the other. I'd moved on but they hadn't. To Tom. I know you're here amongst us mate. And we miss you bro. To Tom. To Tom. To Tom. Cheers. Excuse me. Shane wants to talk tomorrow at the house. Give em the right attention they get a chance to blossom. Secret's finding the balance. Too much loving care and they die. Your poor brother, Tom. So young. Sad. You asked to see me. World been treating you good? Studying, working, traveling a little. You never asked to leave, did you? Didn't know I had to. Oh. You were one of the good ones, son. Kids today, all trying to make a name. No wonder they get shot. I blame music videos myself. I blame you for not sticking around and keeping the little bastards in check. Things changed. Oh, you mean you caught a conscience, felt guilty. Sign of weakness. Yeah well... It's been nice seeing you Shane. Your cousin, Ryan, he lost a batch of something that belongs to me. £40 grands worth to be exact. Now, I'm not saying he stole it. I'm certainly not in the business of killing people to get my money back, but he will get hurt. No he won't. He'll be in your pocket like everyone else. Oh no, not this time, son. See, I don't know him. If you wanna hurt him, then hurt him. We'll have to take your Nana's place in payment. Now, you can cause a ruckus, son, but the outcome will be just the same. Then we'll end up hurting her badly, then Ryan, then you. So think about your next words very carefully. Very carefully, indeed. I think you've been watching far too many gangster films to be honest, Shane. My spine might be fucked, son. Doesn't mean I can't get out of this chair and slap you. What do you want? £40K? You gimme a month I'll clear it. No, no, no, no. You don't just get a stroll back in here and call the shots, son. I let you do that, I'll soon have every little bastard telling me when they can or can't make payment. Look, I can sort something out. I can get something to you but- No, here's what's going to happen. I've had a bad package come up from down south, some real crap coke. Now you are gonna get rid of it for me. Now, you've got six days. On the seventh I count money. Six days? Do you want me to tie an arm behind my back and hop on one foot while I do it too? Keep that tone up, son, you won't have any legs to hop on. Now, just do it. Make the £40 grand, pay Ryan's debt, and your nan gets to keep her place. Aaron, make good and get gone. Take cousin Ryan with you. He took a chance on me when I was a youth. I sold his gear. I made him a lot of money. But none of that mattered now. Not this time. This time my choices were made for me. I guess they always had been. We're fucked. Tell me what happened from the start. He gave me my first batch. I took it home. I stashed it. And someone came in and took the lot. Well, who knew you had it? No one. Tom? Did he know? Well, yeah, but he's family. He's not gonna tell anyone. No one else knew? No, no one. So who did the drop? It was, it was Ben. Ben did the drop. He said this shit happens. So we've gone from no one to now Tom and Ben. You see the problem here, don't ya? Well, they're our people. Ben is not our people. Okay. Why Ben? When you left, he was moving up. He started doing the exchanges. I'm sorry, cuz. I really didn't want to have to involve you in all this. Neither did I. I'm sorry for hitting you. It's okay. Oi, I'll have you all booked. I know your mum, I know yours and I know yours. Get off of me. Stop kicking me. Stop touching my stuff. Get off of me. Yes, I'm a PCSO and you show me respect. You need to respect me. Huh, yeah. What could you do? How much you got on you? I'll call all your parents. Twenty quid, why? Give it me. It's my last twenty man. Get off my stuff. Go home! Hey, yo, shouldn't you lot be at school? You're being a shithead. Shouldn't you be at work? Who's in charge here? What's it got to do with you? That's not what I asked now is it? Do you take me for a dickhead? No, but I bet your mom does. Shut up. No, you shut up. You're Aaron. Do I know you, kid? My name's Sam. I remember you when I was small. You knew my dad Will Jones. Yeah. Yeah, you look like him. How's he? In prison over in Glendales. Nice. Now, come here. PC dickhead. Right I need you to leave this guy alone. Why? He's a idiot. Don't touch- I know. Look, you wanna waste your time with him or do you wanna go buy some smokes? Ah. Don't ever snatch a deal before shaking on it youth. I just hope whatever business you got with him don't involve snitching. We look after our own around here. I noticed the dog back in your window. I wanted it, but Tom said I didn't deserve it. Can I have it? I'll make you a deal. You watch my back and when I'm done with it, it's yours. Only when you got the dog. Beer money! Those kids need a slap and I needed that twenty pound. Look, thanks but, you didn't have to. Wanna be constable over here? You had it all under fucking control, didn't ya? They took my notepad. Right. These two are on the house. Don't take the piss. Only been here two months. I expect a tip. You're definitely still that aren't ya. Dickhead. You ain't thinking of taking Ben's customers, are ya? I'm not thinking anything. I didn't see a few faces last night. What's John doing? He's dead. He got stabbed. Stuart? He got sent down for stabbing John. What? Yeah, it's a long story, mate. Well, he was banging his missus really. What about Shanks? He got locked up. He was caught with two keys on him. Smithy? He's on a credit cards charge. He's on the run. Couldn't anyone get a job? Rick works down at the chippy. Who? Exactly. Remember what they used to say? That you get rich- Or you get caught trying. What's she been up to? She didn't take it too well when you left, cuz. She took it quite bad. She... What? What? Want me to tickle you? She was seeing Ben for like a year. Ben? Okay. What happened? Look, I don't wanna be seen as shit stirring and I definitely don't wanna get involved in all that. Speak of the devil. Oh, he looks pissed. I'll see you back at Nana's. Think you could manage this? You're hashing it. We get it in at 90% pure, cut it down to about 20%. We like to give em 5% extra. Keeps them coming back. Still mixing it with the glucose? It's a cocktail and that's all you need to know, kid. This is for you. With all this goodness, why order this crap? You got seven days from tomorrow. Six, actually. What's the difference. It's the difference between you being the one driving the car and not the one counting the money... kid. Look, what happened to Tom- What? Not now, Eddie. Fuck off. Look... it wasn't good. He was like a little brother to all of us. Know what I mean? No. Because he wasn't. Oi! Get the fuck away from him. Carry your own fucking bags. I'm off-duty. I'm just trying to help him. Can't keep your shit to yourself, can you? I don't know what the issue is? Bit of a wrongen, aren't you? I mean, you sound white, act white, but forget the obvious. What's the problem? I don't get it? The problem is you should be patrolling East Estate where all your other brothers are MC'in about. The 'waa you gwaan'ins' you should be shankin blud. Not walking around here trying to be the fucking man! You don't get to do that to me. You do that again and I'll have you cautioned. Ben was just trying to stand out. You can't blame him. He'd been looking up for too long. But the estate needed a new sign of hope and that came in the form of Martin. Nana, she's so fragile. They take her place, it will finish her. Look. Can I help? Look, I can help. No. I have to fix it. Then what do you want? Not to fuck it all up again. I didn't want to ask but... have you erm... Hm? Have you got 30 quid you can lend me? I remember when 30 quid was small change to us. Going straight means going broke. And how's that working out for ya? I sleep better. That's 40. I'll defo return it tomorrow, okay? Ever think we'd value money like that? Ever think we'd go legit? On that note, if we ain't fucking tonight, you should leave, got work in the morning. Yeah, you sleep. Sleep and get there on time. Wait, man, I'm not sure about this. Relax you're with me. Yeah and that's why I'm fucking scared. Who are these two? Yeah? Yo! You boys lost? Here to see Ruka. Man like you can't come see Ruka. Yo, let's just go. You say something G? You having a laugh? Think it's a joke, ting G? Look, save all your boys for a music video and go and get me Ruka. What we doing here man? You remember when I was banged up for that kidnap charge? Brian Willows. All right. Yeah. I was locked up with a guy called Rupert Heywood aka Ruka. Rupert? The main man on the East Estate is called Rupert. He was in for selling the chemical formula for synthetic marijuana to some Chinaman. Not bad for a university chemist graduate. He's the one that taught me that it's not what you sell, but how you sell it. Every time I picked up from Shane, I'd pay him to use his formula, quadruple the batch, and package it. All in all made me the biggest earner on Shane's books. Fucking hell. Brudda, this here... is whack. It's Shit! On a serious note, real talks, whoever gave you this really doesn't like you. I've had to add an extra quarter and a 30-second kick before it numbs off your nose and licks off your head. This should be a lot better. Yo, can't that shit wait? Texting while you're driving, you know it makes me nervous. Why? 'Cause you're all over the road. Plus you're a shit driver. Add that to the fact that you're writing an essay every time you respond to a bastard text. What even is this piece of shit hired car, mate? Where did you find this? Well, if it makes you feel any better, how's about we put Rupert's CD on? I will throw you and his CD out of this car. You're nasty bro. But I like it I do. Oh my gosh! Hmm, duh. Girl next door? Mm, oh. Looks like she's got a lovely personality. What's that supposed to mean? Ooh, easy tiger. Looks like someone's caught some feelings. Took me ages to get her number. You know, I'm just playing it by the book. That's sweet. I'll let you crack one off. Can I come with ya? What for? We've made like 20 somethin drops today. We've raised five grand and I'm still stuck in the car. Same shit, different postcode. Trust me. I just wanna know how you do it. This ain't work experience. I've been all about the weed, man. I don't give a shit. This coke bunch right, they're like clockwork. We knock on a door and the first words to come out of his mouth will be- Well, fuck me, the devil returns! To which I'll respond, it's been a while. Next minute, I'm in his living room with the rest of the nine-to-five bunch. And they're ready to get proper shit-faced. Looked after me for years. Jeff will start telling me how he's missed me. How he's been getting some quality gear off this one guy just to let me know he's got options. Although I haven't told him nor has anyone even asked what I'm doing at his place. They'll all start bitching about who's putting in what or how much the other owes from last time. Before they start going through their saturated list of coke dealers, Jeff will turn to me and say- You got anything, bruv? They'll take the lot. They always do. Then one of those bubbly bastards has always got a story to tell. Queue is going down quicker than Kate here on a Saturday night. And then some wisecrack will say, 'hey we're going out tonight, why don't you join us?' That's another grand. It's about 34 left I reckon. A lot can happen in a week kidda. Yo, there's Clark and Co. They're coke heads. I didn't know you'd be out. Never asked. You look good. Back in a couple minutes. You got anything, mate? No. But he has. You alright mate. Got anything on ya? Why didn't you sort them out? You kidding. That's the Feds. Come on man. You know I'm good for it. Got some guys who want some stuff. Look I got 80 quid for some gear. Hey, you're fucking nicked! Still fucking around then. Uni could have been good for you. You're really gonna try to lecture me? You loved drawing and all that. That crap is what you used to call it. But you loved it. Shoulda given it a chance. What about you? What you been up to all this time? Been working in my aunt's hotel on the coast. Ooh. Yeah. Sounds glamorous but it's a bit of a shit hole. Did a bit of studying too. You? Study? Yeah. Bit of reading here and there. Enrolled on a couple of short courses. How's things with you and your nan? Different. She's how she was before I got involved with Shane. She's hurting though. I didn't know Tom was that way, I mean, when we spoke. Maybe I should have listened more. I mean, who was I looking up to? Who was Tom looking up to? I had to go. Without saying a word? I wanted out but you wanted to stay. I wanted to talk to you about it. You wanted to talk me out of it. You kept blaming yourself for that junkie's death but... it wasn't your fault. You never called me, not once. I had my reasons. But they'll never be good enough for you. What's with dating Ben? What's with the question? Ben always had a way with the girls but you? You couldn't stand him. Times change. So do people. So why'd you leave him? He hit me. Fucking bastard! You're a little bit late to be my knight in shining armour. Shut up. You know I know it's wrong. What I'm doing to fix this for Nana and Ryan. You've changed. Yep. Yo, can you see Dave? He wants his fast food today, init? He's taking it up north with him. You get those titties out or were you guys holding hands all night? Oi, I'll tell you about it later init. I just didn't wanna walk out on her while she's sleeping. You feeling okay? I really like her. Sweet. All right, Dave's lunchboxes are behind the bagpipes, yeah. How many lunches are we doing? About 30. Where are the bagpipes? Fucksa... You don't know where the bagpipes are? My garden panels, eight from the right. Now, if anyone's listening, I say you've got about 15 minutes before they make a move to see what's sitting there, all right? You cracker. Take a left on Cambridge Road. Shit! Hello. Ryan! Get Ryan! He's shouting. Whoever it is, get em to call me back. He says can you call him back? Tell the little bastard they're onto me, yeah! It's Aaron. It's Aaron, they're onto him. Aaron! Yeah, hold on. Eh yo get the gear out now! What are you doing? Come to your door! What are you doing? Yo, take this. What's it? Close the fucking door! Shit. You alright fellas? You all right kid? What happened? I fell off my bike. Let's get you outta here yeah? Get on. There we go. Here you go. All right? Thank you. You two know why you've been detained? Well, it's probably 'cause you found out that I've been fucking your missus. Oh and then, then I spunked all over your ham sandwiches which she's wrapped up really nicely for you this morning. Now, we got some solid information. So don't you save us all a lot of time and tell us where the goods are. Before you make any more suggestive comments, you need to provide us with some legal representation. I've been having trouble working these. Oh, it's dead easy, mate. They're power controlled, see. Gotta put 'em down first. Good. Now don't fucking touch them again. Move. Come on. Aaron Walker. We can never get that little shit with any gear on him. So why'd he get locked up twice? First time he knocked over a couple of guys, kid moves up the ladder. Starts knocking out heroin. Gave out a dirty dose. He didn't know. Hit Peter Acton hard. Peter Acton? Yeah, he was a local junkie. No one gave a shit about Peter but Aaron did. He took him to the hospital like a fucking saint. Waited there by his bedside till he flatlined. We came in, did a search. We only found a couple of grams on him. Said he was a user. He got a couple of months. He came out and disappeared. What, he got a conscience for a junkie? No. He saw his mum die from an overdose at 10 years old. His kid brother has just gone the same way. You tell me that ain't karma. You shut up. I said shut up! Fuck off! You never really appreciate time until someone takes it away from you. And you lot took your fair share. Like always... you got close... But got nothing. We made it. Yeah. Come here. You all right? I just been telling D, I practically pushed my way through the Feds, mate. I had to go in, grab my shit, and fuck off. You shoulda seen it, mate. There was like 50 of them. Gimme a second, wait. I got a text. You okay? A few cuts and bruises. Who's the dog? Get the gear out now! Hey! Look at you. Amazing. Who is he? I found him, hungry as hell. Owners were shit so I took him. Can I have him? This ain't a teddy bear. We had a dog once but it got knocked over and killed. I'll make you a deal. I'm gonna give him to you for a month and if he ain't glowing, and I mean jumping sky high, telling me how much he loves living with ya, I'll take him back. He's got a good heart. What's his name? Sam, Jr. You named him after me? Well, I ain't calling him Sam. I'll keep the junior. I won't forget this. Hey, what about your bike? I'll be back for it later. Well, someone's done their good deed for the day. She's just been saying that she can help us out. With what? Shifting the gear obviously. This don't involve her. You keep out of it. Look, I still know the clientele. We could get through it. Be like the old days. Well how come you ever stopped? When you left, it got boring. Well, this could prove fruitful. We got our necks on the fucking line here. And you wanna put her in the shit too? I was just saying... No. How much you made? Forget it. How much? Well, from the 6 the overnight plus my 4 and Dave's batch, did he get that? Mm, this morning. That's 18 grand in total. So what, that's another 22 grand in three days. Oh, that's tight, even by your standards. It's two and a half days. It's just gone 12:00. Just doesn't sit right with me you getting involved. The way I see it is, you need all the help you can get. Mm-hm. No. This ain't your problem. Come on, cuz. I want you to leave. Where to this time, Nana? No, this time it's different. I know our Ryan's got you into a spot of bother and you're only trying to help but you can't. I can't leave. Oh, you can. All this it's, it's my fault. If I hadn't sent you away, our Tom would still be here. But I thought you were bad for him. You were always going inside and I didn't want that for Tom. But you're a good boy. I see that now, now it's too late. Forgive me please. Hey... Hey no. What you did was right, Nana. Our Tom... he didn't know. He was just trying to grow up too quick. It's a hundred pounds from my savings. It's, it's all I have just now. Take it and go. Don't, I can't, I... I won't lose both of my boys. I won't leave. This time I'm staying. You're the only family I've got. And I'm not losing you. Okay? Right now Ben will be outside yours with bag of something that belongs to me. You are gonna hold it for me at your place. I ain't touching it. And ain't no one leaving anything at my Nan's, Shane. This don't involve her. We still got two days and we're making money. And there's a pat on the back waiting for you son. But for now, you'll do as you're told. Someone will be here within the hour to pick that up. Wherever you think you're at, enjoy it while it lasts. You don't know what it's like. You were a schoolboy. There's a hundred large worth of heroin in that bag. You remember heroin, don't you? Your career didn't last very long, did it. I need you. Aaron. Who was that, Nana? It's no one really. Just two local boys. What did you give 'em? Nothing really. Tell me the truth. Please, Nana. The area's changed. I give them some money and, and they see I'm all right. My doors and windows aren't vandalised. It's very good of them to look after me. No, don't, please, please no. Aaron, don't. Yeah, what was her name again? Oh man, I can't remember. It's Samantha. Hey! Who's running payments around here? Fuck you! It's Ben's estate. Oi! You wanna fuck with me? Do I even wanna know? When did things get so bad for Shane around here that he had to start charging seniors a rate? Everyone pays. That's my nan. I heard your mum used to pay a rate. Do you think I give a fuck about this place or you or fucking Shane? Shane, Shane was right. You always were too predictable. Danielle helping wasn't part of any deal. Feels exposed. She finishes Gym about now. Doesn't she? One, two. Hit. Power. Power! What's happened, what's wrong? Oh, you're okay. That's a round. Go get changed. You did good. You did really good. Oh. Oh, it's okay. I'm okay. What's happened? I want us to leave this place. Tomorrow. You and me. And forget this, all this bullshit. You're joking, right? The other day on the rooftop, you talked about studying art. You should be doing what you love, not, not this. Where to? What about my work? What about the gym? Anywhere, anywhere but here. You can get a part-time job. You could study. And what about your nan, huh? We'll figure that out too. Just say yes, please. Okay, okay. I think, I think... This is too quick, Aaron. It will be okay. I promise. It's Nana. Hey. Wha, what? What happened? They never hurt you, did they, Nana? Push you? Or hold you. No. No, they just went past me into your room. I try, tried to stop them but they ignored me and, and started throwing things around and and, and then they left. Did you see their faces? No. What about the money? It's gone. All of it. It's okay. I am gonna make this okay. Shane wants the money by midday tomorrow. We leave in the morning and get Nana out first thing. But let her sleep tonight, all right? She's shook up. Let her rest. Hey, hey. Take this. There's 200 there. Yo, I can't take this, cuz. We need to move quick. So you go back to your place, get your stuff, and come back here ASAP. How's about we talk to Shane, eh? We'll tell him what Ben's done, that he set all this up. Don't you get it? Shane's behind all this. This is what he does. This is what he wants. He wants the control. I can't take this, cuz. I fucked up. I need you to stay strong. Ben wasn't supposed to send anyone round to Nana's. What? Ben's told me that if I kept him in the loop about what we were doing and how much gear we was shifting that if we could do it, he was gonna talk to Shane and he was gonna make it okay for us to stick around after pay what we owed. You piece of fuck! They got to Nana. I was trying to make it okay for us, for you to stay! Fuck you, you selfish bastard! You got us into this shit and you fucked us! I was trying to cover all angles. And I didn't want this to go wrong 'cause, I can't lose you, not after Tom. You say my brother's name again I swear I'll rip your fucking head off! You ran away! You left me, you left Nana, and you left Tom! I'm sorry, cuz. I'm fucking sorry, cuz, I'm sorry. Here, there! I'm fucking sorry. Take it, take it all. You're me three years ago. Get the fuck out, get the fuck out my house. Your train leaves in an hour and Aunt Marie will be at the other end to pick you up. You promise me you'll be on that train. And you promise me that you'll be on the next train. I love you, Nana. Hey, it's me. Train leaves at 11. Please tell me you'll be there. Are we really doing this? Yeah and we'll never look back. Listen, I only ever said this once before- Aaron don't. You don't have to. I love you and I always have. Why did you wait so long? I'm not afraid anymore. I'll be there. Yo, it's Ryan's voicemail. Do not leave a message because I will not ring you back. Sit down, please. Now, we both know why I'm here. I'm out of options. What I'm trying to say is show me where you hide the money, the money that belongs to that bastard Ben. Now, this belongs to me. The rest of it I don't give a shit about. Hey, I'm at the station. The train leaves in five minutes. Hello, sweetheart. Danielle's a little busy right now. If you wanna see her again in one piece, I suggest you come get her. Thought you'd leave without saying bye to Tom? It's got nothing to do with her. Let her go. You really didn't see this coming, did you? Times change. So do people. Don't look at me like that. I have to live here. I belong here. You don't just run away every time things get a little bit tough. And what about everything we shared? What about all the girls you fucked back then, hm? Did you tell them you loved them too? No. No? That was a different time. This was gonna be different. Different how? You're running away again. All this for what? I trusted you. And I trusted you. You left me with fuck all. And I will never forget that. For what you're worth right now, I feel sorry for you. Fuck you! Not nice is it? One of your own fucking you over like that. This place has changed since I was a boy. Nobody ever wins round here. You were a winner. You know why? You were always two steps ahead. I treated you like one of my own. You walked away. I was doing good by Tom. I didn't wanna lose anyone else. I was protecting my own. You lost Tom. No. How else were we supposed to get you back, eh? What were the chances? What? No. No. Aaron, you don't just get to walk away. You got in, you got close. You got to know things. That can be very dangerous for people these days. Please don't tell me you did that to Tom because of me, Shane. You forgot our code, son. Please. We all answer to someone. Fucking rain. We needed an angle. We let Ryan move up the ladder. Knew he stashed his gear at his place. He talks too much. We made the move and who should see us? Tom. He always was a little naive. Sweet though. Alright mate. What are you guys doing? Get off of me. Shh. Just want you to try something far us, mate. Just get off me please. I, I need to get back to my nan's. I promise you, I promise you I haven't done anything please. Please. Your brother used to make a killing on this shit. Please, get off me, please. I promise you I haven't done anything. Let see what it does, eh? Please. Please, please, just get off me. Stop fucking around. Or I'm gonna put this bastard in your eye. It's called a dirty dose. You know the one. Done like a perfect accident. It all played out on cue. What did you do to Tom? That doesn't concern you. Look leave him alone. He's had enough. Fuck off, love. You played your part. You're gonna kill him. I think you already did. Tom! Tom! He crawled Just like you. Aaron. I watched him die. Took a while. And all he'd do was call your name. Aaron. Where were you, big bro? Tom! I'm sor... I'm sorry! Get away from him! Move! Move. Move! What you doing? Leave him alone. Leave him alone! Leave him alone! What the fuck's this now? It's not fair! Step back. Fuck off, kid. Aaron. I don't think he's breathing. Oi, stand back! Now! Ryan he ain't he breathing! You radio this in and you're finished. Sierra, Sierra, Foxtrot, 7-9-3. Requesting backup to West Estate. I need a unit and an ambulance now. Repeat, requesting backup and an ambulance to West Estate. If anything happens to me, please apprehend one Benjamin Jones at 514 West Estate. That's Benjamin Jones at 514 West Estate. Copy. Units responding. You're fucking finished, mate. No... you are! If he dies on my watch, you are done! Now, stand fucking back! You fucking what? I said stand back. Stay back now! Don't come closer. Do you know who the fuck you're talking to? I don't care who you are! Move away! I don't know. I've been told he's not breathing. Oh, I'm so sorry. So are you ready to talk? Saw some people moving into Aaron's nan's place. Shane shoulda taken it. What'd he do? Let the bitch keep it. What does she do? Sell it to some fucking polacks. He went away for awhile didn't he? Heard from Danielle he was studying. Aaron, study? Yeah, journalism. What's that like media? Like reporting on current news, interviews. And what's he gonna do with that? Can we stop talking about Aaron? He's gone. Done. Yeah. Channel what? Look, slow the fuck down, yeah? Will I be alive when this is aired? What the fuck? I stopped caring about that a long time ago. This is my story. My name's Aaron Walker. After three years, I returned to my old estate after hearing that my younger brother Tom had died from a heroin overdose. This is my documentary about where I used to live, why I was forced to sell drugs, the murder of my brother, and why the kids of tomorrow are looking up to all the wrong people... just like I once did. Just testing out the camera with the audio and so far... it looks pretty decent. You don't just get to stroll back in here and call the shots, son. I let you do that I'll soon have every little bastard telling me when they can or can't make payment. I had a bad package come up from down south, real crap coke. Now you are gonna get rid of it for me. Now you got six days. On the seventh, I count money. Are they Tom's? We get it in at 90% pure, cut it down to about 20%. Last year we locked down all five fucking estates. You were a school boy. There's a hundred live worth of heroin in that bag. These shit headphones don't even work. Think they're ready to hit the stash house? Not yet. These guys are directly connected to Ben. CID are sitting on it for awhile. Figure old man Eddie ain't going anywhere anytime soon. Oh, and neither is the money. Look I can help. No. Times change. So do people. Fuck you. It's called a dirty dose. You know the one. It all played out on cue. I just hope whatever business you got with him don't involve snitching. We look after our own around here.
