Well done. You're doing really well. Keep it up. We can see your every move now. Fantastic! Don't rush. There's no rush. Over. It's amazing. Over. Go on, Alison! Yes, she's done it. She's there. A 33-year-old mother has become the first British woman to conquer Mount Everest alone and without an oxygen supply. Alison Hargreaves from Torlundy, near Fort William, is the only British professional female mountaineer... Alison Hargreaves had nurtured her ambition to conquer Everest without oxygen since her school days. After a failed attempt last year, driven back by appalling weather, the 33-year-old finally sent word back to her husband by fax that she was on top of the world. Alison, mother of two, reached the summit of Everest, 8,848 metres, 13th of May, 1995, at 12:08pm, Nepalese time. Can you keep your heads up? Heads up. Heads up. Heads up. Kate. Heads up. Kate... Go to your left. Go that way, Tom. Just like as if we're going skiing. Carry straight on. You're a mother of two young children. What did they think when Mum come home, world record holder? Well, they don't really understand. They know Mum's done something special cos people keep asking them about what Mummy's just done. But Mummy's always gone off and climbed mountains, so to a certain extent, it's fairly normal. Do you think Mum is very clever? Yes! Why is your mum very clever? Because she climbed Mount Everest. And she climbed Mount Everest all on... Her own. Without any... BOTH: Oxygen! And why is that clever? Because it... Because it's clever! Because it's very clever! Shall we pump it up for your mum because... Yeah! Yeah! Three cheers for your mum because she's a record breaker! What's next? In a couple of weeks' time, I'm off to Pakistan to try and climb K2, which is the second highest in the world. It's not so high, but maybe a little bit more difficult. So that'll be fun. What drives you on? I don't know. Something inside. I love climbing mountains and I love standing on top and to have stood on top of the highest in the world, for me, is unbelievable. Conquering Everest and K2 in the one season without oxygen is unprecedented, but as she prepares to set off, Alison Hargreaves is well aware of the dangers. When we go climbing, we obviously minimise the risks and if we thought it was that risky, we wouldn't go climbing. Anybody who went off thinking, you know, that there was a very high chance they wouldn't come back, I think, is... It's a very unfair thing to do, especially with a young family. Basically, you know, climbers climb. We know our strengths and our weaknesses and hopefully, we can normally make the right decisions at the right time. Tom, what do you think of your mummy? She's very nice and she is very clever, so she should do it. PANTING I'm a mole, I'm a mole, and I live in a hole! Hoo... PANTING I'm a mole. CHILD SHOUTING GIGGLING I had the worst job that any parent's ever going to have in their life. I sat the children down in a quiet room and, um... And told them that their mother was more than likely dead and they wouldn't see her again. And she was lost in a storm in K2. Um... And Kate cried and shouted, as small children will. And Tom asked if he and Kate could see their mum's last mountain. And I didn't think for very long. I gave them my promise that they would see where their mum died and more importantly, their mum's last mountain. Well, that's it, chaps. That's the last of the bags. Everything's packed now. All we need is the station. SNEEZES Thank you. Take care, look after the kids. I will, do not worry. Take care. See you when I come back. RADIO CHATTER The passengers sitting on the left-hand side can have a view of K2, and the Broad Peak onto the left of it is finally visible. Where's K2? K2's the pointy one. Straight over this guy's ear. There. The big pointy one, your mum stood on top of that and Everest. Big pointy. Yup. That's the one. Nobody knows how life is going to unfold. Nobody knew we were going to have two smashing children. But we did. And the one promise we made to each other that was totally binding was that we would always bring our children up in the wide open spaces, in freedom, learning what spirit's about, learning what adventure's about, enjoying, understanding and accepting the wild and beautiful places of this Earth. I wouldn't like to see Tom and Kate do anything that people wanted them to do. I'd only like to see Tom and Kate have the opportunity to do what they want to do, be it bricklayer or brain surgeon. But it would be an awfully hard act for Kate to have to follow the greatest woman climber. And even more impossible to follow as a boy. But who knows? The mountains, I think, are magnetic. There is some sort of force that pulls you in. It's the aura. It's the purity. The open, vast sky. You can see forever. And the mountains have this awesome power. DISTANT BANG AND RUMBLE You can't conquer them. They were there before us and after we've gone, they'll still be there. And so instead of fighting against them, you have to find a way to work with them. You have to be in harmony. And sometimes, they let you and other times, they won't. But we're always sort of pushing ourselves a little bit, to see how far we can go, you know, how far to the edge can we go before we topple off. Danger is very personal to everybody. Yes! Pushing your own personal limits, whether that's going for longer, or higher, or faster, or harder. But never fighting against the mountain, because you can't. Because they'll always win in the end. ICE SMASHES LOUDLY My relationship with the mountains is, I would say, not completely different to Tom's. You know, our love and our drive is exactly the same. But he's got goals in mind, he's got... "I want to do this peak and this peak and this peak, "and I want to do this route on this peak and this one on this one" and he just strives to climb. It's all he's ever wanted to do, you know. That's fine and that is and has always been Tom. Nobody knows why Tom is the way he is, he's just a climber and always will be. Anyone that's ever seen Tom on a mountain would say how much like an ibex he is. Just so sure-footed. It's hard to explain. I've never seen anyone like that. I don't know what Tom's plans are, I've got no idea. But if he does take his climbing to a higher level, I definitely want to be a part of it. And while he's climbing, I'm sure I'll be doing other things. I adore to climb mountains, don't get me wrong. But I don't just necessarily want to get to the top and down again. But if I'm climbing with Tom, it's like 200 million times easier than if I was doing it with anybody else. Anybody else in the entire world. Having Tom by my side is like having protection, a helping hand, or just... ..a nice person to have next to you when you're on the mountain. That's a nice thing for a sister to say, isn't it, Tom? It's very nice, yeah. See? I can be nice! Ah, OK. I didn't know. Only a joke. The time's 17 minutes to nine. The climber Tom Ballard has just completed a remarkable feat. The six great north faces of the Alps, all climbed alone, in winter, in one season. He's the son of Alison Hargreaves, who did the same thing in the summer season. In 1995, Alison Hargreaves was killed after reaching the summit of K2, the world's... The six great peaks of Europe, climb the north faces all in one winter. Sounds an absolutely miserable business to me. How difficult was it? The main difficulty is getting the right conditions at the right time and then, you know, I think maybe 80% is more down to luck with the weather and the thing is, the mountains will always be there. You just have to make sure that you are. It's just a shame that climbing isn't an Olympic sport because we'd be nailed on for gold with you, surely, wouldn't we? Yeah, it would be nice, actually, to have a nice gold medal, instead of just a nice feeling at the end of the day. Well, Tom, lovely talking to you and continued success. I'm sure your mum would be very proud indeed. I think so too. Thank you very much. All right. All the best. That's Tom Ballard, a world-beating British climber and we are proud of him. It's just gone 26 minutes past 11... I genuinely believe, like his mother had a talent, Tom has a fantastic talent and I believe that Tom, up to this moment in time, knows how to use that talent. But I don't believe in omnipotence. The problem is that the game he's playing, particularly if he transfers it to higher peaks, goes from playing Russian roulette with maybe no or one bullet in to playing Russian roulette with quite a lot of bullets in. The search continues for a British climber who's gone missing on Nanga Parbat, a giant peak in Pakistan, nicknamed the Killer Mountain. Two military helicopters are searching for Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi, as they lost contact over a week ago. Tom Ballard, part of an East Midlands mountaineering dynasty, is regarded as one of the world's finest Alpinists. He posts regular updates of his exploits to his thousands of followers online. His last update was nine days ago. "Life is like a holiday, "while we wait for that elusive weather window." He hasn't been seen since Sunday. So, we've got Tom and Daniele somewhere high on the spur. The comms aren't working. And that's the last concrete information we have. Kate is in South Africa, and she said, "How long, Dad? How long?" And I said, "Look," you know. I said, "You know me, "I'm not given to snatching at things in the air, "nor am I given to, you know, "letting my emotions run away, but seven to ten days, no problem. "You know, the boy will be cold, he might have a bit of frostbite, "he'll certainly be really bad-tempered, "but that's the thing we have to remember." But, Jim, do you...? PHONE RINGS Hi, Kate. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. I was just talking to Luigi, that's Daniele's other brother, and he said if I was going to call you, then maybe I could just update you. That'd be very nice, Kate. So, helicopter's took off this morning to go have a look at a possible sighting. Um... What they saw, they can't see clearly, but what they could see is that the two... The two bodies, and they are bodies because they're not moving, if they are bodies, 80% sure they are bodies, one is wearing orange, one is wearing blue. They can't be 100% sure, but like I say, they're not moving, so... OK, dear. OK. And... So that's what he just told me. OK. So, how are you bearing up with that? SHE SOBS It's heartbreaking, Kate, and I'm sorry. You know, I wish I could say something that could make you feel better at the moment. Um... KATE SNIFFLES You...you...you really do need to try and find something to do and help that...that takes your mind off it so that you can...you can go back to...to...to trying to remember the good times, the great times, and, um... I don't want to talk... Dad, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not willing to talk and think about the good times! And any, like, any, er... I'm not... Until we find Tom, until the rescue is called off, I'm not going to think of this situation like Tom is dead. I don't...I'm not willing to...accept it until the rescue has been called off one way or the other. So I'm not willing to... OK, OK. ..listen to anyone that has... OK...anything to say about Tom being dead. Because quite frankly, I know Tom so well and I know that he can get himself out of any situations. OK, Kate, let's... So if that is perhaps Tom lying there, then as far as I'm concerned, he's still alive and we need to go and get him. Yeah. Well, I'm sure there's a lot of people feel that, the same as you do, Kate. Do you want to talk later? Shall I ring you later? I'll talk to you later. OK, dear. OK? Lots of love... Bye. ..lots of hugs. Talk to you later. Au revoir. Lots of love. Au revoir. Au revoir, dear. CALL DISCONNECTS Well, that's how some people cope, and unfortunately, it seems to be the way Kate is coping, and it's not a happy experience, because there's nothing I can say. I suppose what is frustrating Kate is the fact is it is out of her control. Probably, we will not know very much about what was found on the mountain until the search is finished. But, you know... there is still a chance. NEWS PROGRAMME THEME Hello, a very good evening to you. Rescuers have found the bodies of the missing British mountaineer Tom Ballard and his Italian climbing companion, Daniele Nardi, in Pakistan. Contact was lost with the pair almost two weeks ago during an ascent of one of the world's highest mountains, Nanga Parbat, in the Himalayas. Mr Ballard is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died on the mountain, K2... After hours of searching from Pakistani helicopters and special teams from Spain, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan announced the search was over as the bodies had been spotted. Alex Txikon was part of the search team and was one of the first to climb Nanga Parbat in the winter just three years ago. Not so good news. We spotted the bodies of Daniele Nardi and Tom Ballard. They are in quite a difficult and high-altitude area, which is impossible for us to reach there. Really super-risky to attempt any...any...any rescue missions. They will stay for always on Nanga Parbat. You know, it's a very, very sad moment. Tom Ballard's mother, Alison Hargreaves, was killed in a storm while descending from the summit of K2, the world's second-highest mountain, about 100 miles away from where Tom died. POIGNANT INSTRUMENTAL This is your captain. I welcome you on board Flight 3451. After another two to three minutes, people sitting on the right will be able to see Nanga Parbat. And we'll commence our descent... FAINT TRAFFIC DIN It's six months since we lost Tom. He and Daniele are still up there, at peace, on Nanga Parbat. I've been to collect Tom's passport. That's a big relief, to have that small red book back in the family's possession. But it's... it's papers, you know, it's not...it's not actually Tom. So it's just paperwork. The most important thing now for me is to meet the Italian Ambassador of Pakistan. He supervised over the search and rescue efforts after Tom and Daniele went missing. So he'll have more information about what actually happened to Tom and Daniele. What happens on Nanga Parbat, apparently, is, on that...on the, um... ..on that route, is that snow comes down, and it snows heavily. Then it kind of freezes and accumulates. And when it's too heavy, it just goes down. OK. And that happens every three to six hours. So one idea is that there may have been a ice avalanche, a serac, which hit them. It was certainly not a snowstorm because a snowstorm would have wiped out everything. And, er...Alex Txikon, who we enlisted for the rescue operation, inferred from the position of the bodies and the general conditions of how they were found, that they may have died a different way. Which was, er...as they were coming down, they were still roped, and, er... Tom was possibly... Because he's... he's kind of hanging... ..in a...in an awkward position in the ropes. He might have gotten tangled in the ropes. Daniele was going up to try to... to cut the ropes or, you know, get free of the ropes. And they may have been victim of a climate of minus-50 degrees, and may have died that way. "Ha sido una muerte cruel." Alex Txikon used those words. "They have died a cruel death." I'm sorry, I thought you actually were... ..aware of all these... No, no, no. Not aware of that at all. HORN BLASTS We've... Of course we don't...didn't ever think we knew exactly what had happened, but the story that we took on board was that... ..they climbed, they went to bed in their tent, probably very cold up at that altitude, and sometime during the night, while they were peacefully asleep, probably dreaming about climbing, that a serac from high above them broke off and the force...just ripped them straight out of their tent and threw them off the mountain. And they would have died immediately on impact from the force, just as...just as we believe happened to Mum. That you wouldn't have felt anything, it just happened so suddenly... that you don't... And that he was asleep. That was... So that was kind of reassuring for us. And that's been, for the last however many months since the accident, that's what we have thought happened. And now, today, to have heard... ..that they were hanging, dangling, dying slowly... ..fully aware of what was going on, um... And that...and, er... his exact words were that it was a...a cruel death. TEARFUL: That's... that's really big news. I could be happier and live easier knowing that he was...at peace. But to hear that he could have been really suffering for a long time, and we couldn't get to them, is... ..heartbreaking. CLOCK CHIMES FAINT BARKING BIRDSONG When I wake up in the morning, I'm perfectly well aware that since that day, er... when the news came through, my world would be completely different. Because... ..I never saw a way in which Tom would come to grief on mountains early. It goes right down the side of Chile. It still doesn't seem real sometimes. You know, I don't...I don't think it isn't real, but it is difficult to see it as real. FAINT CHATTER I think you just have to accept that Tom is not coming back... ..just like his mum didn't, and you have to work out a way of living with it. The last floods, Tom, were, er...just after your mum died. And it was like the mountain shedding tears for her. It just rained and rained and stormed and stormed. And it washed all the roads out. Your mum's spirit's still here. It's only your mum's body that's gone. That doesn't matter, Tom. Your mum's spirit's in all these mountains. She's probably just coming back from a good day's climbing today. There'll be no rest for anybody in heaven if your mum's around. Oh, dear! In 1995, Dad brought Tom and I here, for a journey to K2, which was Mum's last mountain. But now, the most important thing for me is I'm going to trek to Nanga Parbat basecamp to visit Tom's last mountain. It's kind of history repeating itself. I was only four at the time. And, yeah, so the only part of the trek I remember is that I had a minder. I had Big Ibrahim, as we called him. And...I...I remember his smell. I remember... A nice smell, not a bad smell. Just a warm, safe smell from... Cos I think I slept a lot on his...on his neck. I just remember him always looking after me. IBRAHIM WHISTLES I want to go across the bridge! You want to go across the bridge? Yeah. You going to cross the bridge with Ibrahim? I think you can go anywhere with Ibrahim. CHEERING AND WHOOPING I feel a little bit nervous. SHE GIGGLES Not nervous, but I've got butterflies. It's been 25 years since I've seen him. Very excited! Here. Look! Ah! That's him! Yeah. Welcome! OK, leave it down here. Hello! Hello. How are you? How are you? Good! KATE CHUCKLES EMOTIONALLY Good? Thank you for having me here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Welcome. Looking well. FAINT CHATTER You're well? Yes. Yes? You well? Yes. FAINT CHATTER KATE CHUCKLES Welcome! Long time. Yes. I'm big now. THEY LAUGH Still smaller than you. Good? Yes. Just to translate, yes? It's good to be here. Yeah. Yeah. IBRAHIM SPEAKS He cannot feel his express. He cannot feel his express. He's so emotional. Same. IBRAHIM AND TRANSLATOR CONVERSE He feels very guilty because somehow, it is very nice to see her, but some...at another point, it's very sad to see her without her brother because she was... he was carrying her as a, like, child and with her brother, and now it is so...so hard to see her. Yes. Yeah. KATE SNIFFLES He said, I always hoped I would see her again. OK! Well done. Thank you, Ibrahim. Are we there, Daddy? This is it, love, yep. Thank you. I also brought for you... Because it's my favourite photograph. IBRAHIM LAUGHS Yes. Can you remember, was Kate heavy on your shoulder? Yeah, a little heavy. No! THEY LAUGH But... SHE CLEARS THROAT ..I'm happy Tom and my mum are here. Yes. If anywhere they could be... ..it's the most beautiful place in the world. And it's where they wanted to be. CHILDREN CHATTER Oh, look at the mountains, Dad! Look! They're stunning! I know. The sun's come on it again, hasn't it? It's licking the top of that. That's 6,400 metres above sea level. CHILDREN CHATTER EXCITEDLY Big Ibrahim, he's welcomed us into his home and we've had tea and biscuits, and now he'll join us on our trek to Nanga Parbat. CHILDREN GIGGLE Bye-bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! IBRAHIM CHATS STRING MUSIC FAINT WHISPERING THEY PRAY Somehow, the stars have aligned and we will, God willing, see Nanga Parbat today. And actually, it's a very special day today. It's Tom's birthday today. Tom would be 31 today. Happy birthday, Tom. POIGNANT INSTRUMENTAL Even before I was born, I climbed, er...the Eiger. Inside my mum's tummy. She was, um...six months pregnant with me. I think she found it a bit difficult with her bump to squeeze through. And then, when I was first born, I was always exposed to this environment. Um...and so, that must be... I mean, mountains are in my blood, I guess. Mummy? Oh, good lad. Good job you're going, isn't it? Good job. Mummy? Mind out of the way, camera, cos you're going to get treaded on. I'm going to count them! I think you've always got that thing inside you that says, you know, whether you want to be a footballer or...or anything like that. Inside you, you know what you want to be and you know what you want to do. It's kind of your calling, if you like. So then I had kind of...you know, I had a vision, of, you know... And I knew what I wanted to do then. So, it's not just a physical thing, but quite a spiritual experience? Very much so, yes. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. So, when you're on the mountains, when you're climbing, you're in touch with something deeper within you? Yes. Yes. But you never know quite what it is. It's just... You know, it just feels right. You can tell that he's totally in control. Totally at peace with himself. You know, he's now about 70, 80 feet above the floor and... I mean, I know, as a realist, that if he falls off now or certainly fell off higher up, the chances are, he's going to get very seriously hurt. I've always thought there is quite a definite line between good adventure and danger. And the trick is to make sure you've always got your feet on the line, and you don't step over it. When he's older, it's up to him how far he takes himself to the edge of that line. Do you remember? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah? I carried you... You carried him also? Yeah! THEY CHUCKLE You carried both. This is Kipper, and this came from...this came from my mum. IBRAHIM SPEAKS So it's always with me. Yeah, yeah. I don't know how much I remember of my mum and how much I know of my mum from her appearance in film and magazines and newspapers... It's only a camera...and my stories that my dad has told me. It's difficult to differentiate what's my true memories and what's come from outside. Although her physical form is not here, I feel her...in every way. And especially in the mountains. Now, with Tom also being lost here, it's like I'll have to spend even more time here because it's where they are. Phew! Now, look! This is Nanga Parbat! Big lump of a mountain. Yeah, it is, isn't it? It's ginormous, and we're still very far away. Yeah. It's...it's breathtaking. I can understand why he wanted to climb it. I want to climb it, too! Tom was a mountaineer through and through. He was born to be on the mountains. He got all of mum's gift for mountaineering... ..and I didn't. SHE CHUCKLES Woohoo! In my teenage years, I found myself very jealous of Tom's genius. Yeah, nice! Brilliant! Of how talented he was. Not only that, but also, his drive and how passionate he was about a certain thing. And I was always, liked this, liked that, enjoyed this, enjoyed that, loved this, loved that. Hey-hey-hey! Tom, there was one thing, and it was mountaineering, climbing. Argh! And that, I envied. Because he just knew. Ah! Argh! Oh! Fucker! FUCK! Oh! WIND BLOWS FAINT CHATTER This is the kitchen. Um...food is hanging up from various places so it can't be attacked by any animals, wild animals. Mainly me. Um... CAMERA OPERATOR CHUCKLES We have the stove, er...all the implements. Just a normal kitchen, really. Also, sort of partly living room. Er...quite open-plan. Um... Plenty of fresh air, good ventilation. Nice view. Er...a stone's throw away from the...the river. Yeah. And show me where you sleep. Er...I sleep in the van. The big tent, my father sleeps in there. Also, we keep a lot of stuff in there. OK. And I sleep in the van. Obviously, it's full of climbing gear and... Er...comfortable? Yeah, it's very comfortable. Yeah, very comfortable. In winter, it's a bit cold. And do you miss living in a house with a bedroom and all the mod cons? Er...not especially, but... No, not especially, no. You're used to this now? Well, yeah. I've been living like this, or even just without the kitchen, just with the van, er... Yeah...for the last four or five years, so... Yeah, yeah. It's quite normal for me now. MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO There is something very simple and very primeval about having only one thing to do. We had nothing else to do but climb the routes that Tom wanted to climb. We just had enough money. We just had enough equipment in the early days. And that's what we did. Which is what made Tom what he was. His training was like you would train for an Olympics. Today, dry tooling. Ah! Training for the winter. In summer! Yeah. THEY CHUCKLE This is not winter, we're not...we're not tough. Virtual ice, virtual snow. Yeah. You have to imagine it's cold, there is ice. Yeah. There is snow. When I'm climbing, I become a part of the mountain itself, and that becomes part of me. Um...like, for instance, I'm... I'm a moving rock or a piece of ice. You're becoming more...more in tune with the mountain. It's a completely different experience. Because of my sort of circumstances and my...the way I am personally, and the fact that I prefer to be on my own, I prefer to be away from people, and the way we sort of live in camps, I think that's actually helped me because I've become fitter. Always training, he never stopped. He had a super energy. I always thought he wasn't, er... he wasn't part of this world. He was like, er...an "alian". You say an "alian". An alien. An alien. An alien! Yeah, yeah. SHE LAUGHS He wasn't human. WAVES CRASH GULLS CRY How did I fall in love with Tom? Er...I liked him, first of all, because he was different. He had a completely different lifestyle. Out of the ordinary, you know? No, he was cool. I mean, because he was authentic. He was a...pure person. He just liked to climb, to be in nature. And to live as he wanted was important for him. Of course, he made room in his life for me because we climbed together. It wouldn't have been possible if I wasn't a climber. It wouldn't even have started. I liked my life with him because we could have adventures together, we could share things. And that's the most important thing. The first time, actually, we kissed, it was when we climbed the first route, the first ascent of, er...Baptism of Fire, actually, he called it. And, yeah, we were both 26 when we met. Now tilting your head. SHUTTER CLICKS TOM CHUCKLES It's funny? Yeah, it's funny. But with the... Like this? Yes. When I first knew him, he wasn't well known. All proper climbers, eh? But the project that made him stand out, it was the six North Faces. He was called to do lectures. They made a film of him. And so, I think his life changed. And everybody wanted to know him, for sure, somebody so special. Hello. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. I met your mother a few times. Mm. In the...in the '80s. And I did a book on women climbing. Yeah, Women On Top. And in this book, I say openly, she was the greatest mountaineer ever. Yeah, I think that's true. She's not yet... No, nobody's even close, I think. Nobody's even got close. Yeah. THEY CHATTER And you're now becoming a professional mountaineer? Yeah. OK. OK. All the best. Thank you very much. After you. Ah, thank you very much. You are very, very figo. SHE LAUGHS Everybody loved Tom. Everybody loved Tom. My mum was in love with him. Oh, my God! Everybody was in love in my family with Tom. My brothers loved him. Grazie. You're welcome. He was simple. He was simple and very nice with everybody. OK. And you, too. Grazie mille. Have a nice evening. Ciao. Ciao. One more. One more shot. But then, of course, he couldn't judge people. And, like a child, you know, that you give him a sweet, he takes it, even if it's not good. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Daniele always wanted to be recognised as a good mountaineer. He said he felt like he was always an outcast because he...he came from the south, because he was not... He told me, "For...for most people in Italy, I'm not credible". He wanted to be credible as a mountaineer. Because all the important, the biggest mountaineers, Italian mountaineers, are from the north. Here, people take the boat and go to sea, you know? They don't climb the mountains. So he was...he was an outcast, but he was also a real fighter. WIND GUSTS Whoo! Windy! He was 42, so he was much older than Tom. An impressive...Himalayan record. Climbed some big peaks. But I'd never met the guy, I'd never heard of him until Tom told me that Daniele had suggested they become climbing partners. And I think that Daniele realised what a tour de force Tom was capable of delivering. Soft snow, huh? Yeah. It's not very nice. DANIELE CHUCKLES The first time we met Daniele was in Chamonix, 2016. He went climbing with him. And, yeah, for sure, he had some experience, Daniele. I won't say no. But for sure, he wasn't even close to as talented as Tom. Tom, he was how we say in Italian, we say, "cavallo di punta", he was one of the best in the world. Tom? Tom, yeah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha! Yeah! Daniele told me that Tom was very strong, very technical and very focused. And Daniele thought that he could be a good companion. The best companion, maybe. I wasn't happy about him going there, and I tried to convince, to persuade him not to go. But then I also thought, "OK, I can't really, because it's his life "and if he wants to go, he must go". This expedition was going to be Daniele's fifth attempt to the summit, but through the Mummery Spur. He always told me at the beginning, "I'm not going to Nanga Parbat, I'm going to the Mummery Spur. "The Mummery Spur is the challenge for me." There are various routes up Nanga Parbat - the Kinshofer route and the Messner route. But Daniele wasn't interested in those. He wanted to go up Nanga Parbat through the Mummery Spur, which has still not been climbed. He loved that route because he told me that it was the most direct to the top and it was...it was the most elegant. If you look at the mountain, it's like a finger pointed to the top. And he was in love with this fact. He was in love with the elegance, you know. WIND GUSTS But we talked also about the fact that the Spur could be very dangerous. WIND GUSTS Super-dangerous. Super-dangerous. It's one of the craziest places that I ever been in my life, believe me. WIND GUSTS It's much more dangerous and risky than...than...than hard and technical. It's so dangerous. I will show you right now. Look at here. These seracs, it's totally crazy. This is huge, great blocks of ice? Yes. Yeah, yeah. All this ice. And it's more than 100 metres high. When this serac fell down, even the avalanches reached to the basecamp, and...and...and...and this is like a big explosion. This is huge! It's massive! It's giant! LOUD RUMBLING So when you heard that... Yes. ..Daniele and Tom... Yes. were to climb the Mummery Spur, at that time of the year... I wasn't scared. This 7th of January wasn't scared, because I knew that Daniele has the experience. But with Nanga Parbat, sometimes I think climbers will become obsessed. And I think Daniele was a little bit obsessed with Mummery Spur. For me, Mummery is the best dream I can imagine. So I use all my energy and my power to do it for three years. Daniele Nardi was with us on the attempts on Nanga Parbat 2014/15, 15/16. THEY CHAT He knew very well that we showed to the world that Nanga Parbat was possible in winter by the Kinshofer route. But for Daniele, that's not enough, the classical route. Daniele Nardi wants to show my opinion to the world that "I'm here, I'm Daniele Nardi, and I will try for Mummery route". HE CRIES OUT UNHAPPILY Daniele was a good climber, but I think was drunk on ambition. But for Tom... ..you know, if you are driving in a car, OK, I'm... How you say in English? Say, "Hi", when you are... Hitchhiking. Hitchhiking, and the car stops to you, "Hello", but you are with a man that is totally drunk, and you take the decision to go with him, and then you crash, and both of you died, you know, you take your decision. Climbing, alpinism is not for heroes, is not a right thing that you must be there in danger for months. It wasn't Tom's style. I mean, it was completely stupid. THEY LAUGH Before he left, he left some stuff here, in Fassa Valley, my house. And I thought, "Fuck, this maybe is the last time he is here." I had that feeling it was the last time I would see him. Strange. Premonition, you call it? Yeah. Mm-hm. Stay in touch. Be connected to our Facebook profile because we send you photo to the Instagram place. Every hour. Follow us, Nardi and Ballard, to Pakistan. Be connected. Yeah. Ooh! Think we're nearing our bridge. Used to be the starting point for our trek. I just feel so happy from inside. Can't stop smiling, even though obviously it's horrible... ..circumstances, but it doesn't take away the beauty and the joy of the mountains in this place. I think for Kate it comes down to a trip of two halves. I think, first of all, there's the joy of meeting with Big Ibrahim. Then I think she'll enjoy seeing where Tom lies and covering the terrain that Tom covered. Except, of course, it will be entirely different in the sense that she's there in autumn and he was there in deep winter. # You're in the Army, you're not behind a plough... # You're in the Army now # You're not behind a plough... # Yeah. It's great, I love it. Yeah, I just feel so natural. It's nice. Happy. Happy? He's happy that I'm walking and not on his shoulders. THEY LAUGH You know? Yeah, yeah. I don't think that the roles have changed in any way. He's most definitely still my minder, and looking after me, but I'm very conscious of his health as well. It's slightly worrying a little bit how heavy he's breathing. He had to stop a lot. And he just doesn't seem like he's in the best of shapes. He's retired, so it's understandable. But we're walking together the whole way, so we'll take care of each other. Nice snow. You are enjoying? Yeah, it's good fun. Not so easy with these boots but... ..better than walking. Sure. With no shoes. THEY LAUGH I spent with them three weeks going to the base camp. Then I spent some days there and then I came back and I had the feeling that Tom was really, at the beginning, was really excited to be there. And they were really nice together, really nice. They took care of each other, in a very tender way. They were like brothers and they just could look at each other and understand what they were thinking and what to do. I don't know Tom so well. He was so sweet. But I think there was anger. Like a knot of anger that can explode sometimes and... Yes. And sadness. Yeah. I think he also felt the pressure of being Alison's son. All these stories about his mother, how great she was, how extraordinary she was. She was an inspiration, but she was also a very heavy heritage. The way she died put her in a place where now she's untouchable. HE SHOUTS Higher, higher, higher. Bit right, bit right. Not good. Right hand to hold. Easy. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Go! Go! THEY LAUGH I don't know how you organised this expedition without beer, without wine, without vodka, without... HE SIGHS ..whisky. No brandy. Karim, really, I do it because you are Pakistani... Come on, man! You didn't ask us! Because I said, "They are Islam. They pray five times a day." Islam is moderate, Islam now! More? Yeah! We can drink. Really? Yeah. I love it! At the beginning, it was, you know, it was the first time with them, four of us, you know, we had a good relation, we were understanding each other. We were learning from each other, you know. We had a good team, I think, yeah. Here, Mr Rahmat. And...Tom wants to try some wall hangings. Wow. Great, man. Tom was the youngest in our team. He was a really great person and I thought, "This is a good partner," you know? It snowed all day yesterday, so I'm breaking the trail to Camp 1. We've got to find a new way across the glacier, because the way that we came last, the serac is falling down. Very cold today. Very clear. Absolutely amazing. RAHMAT AND KARIM DISCUSS It's very cold. We're going to stay here tonight and move up to Camp 2, or even Camp 3 tomorrow, depending on the snow conditions. Hopefully there'll be some avalanches tonight, clear the snow. Otherwise, it's going to be hard work. AVALANCHE ROARS WIND HOWLS I have seen huge, huge crevasses there which were... I didn't see before. ICE CRACKS, RUMBLING It was terrifying and we have emotions to reach higher and higher. But if something happened while climbing there, you wouldn't survive. ICE CRACKS, RUMBLING WIND BLOWS The weather's not the best today. But, uh... HE SIGHS ..it's hard work, on the way to Camp 3. Soft snow... ..so spindrift. Fortunately, not too cold. HE SIGHS Cold enough. Hard work. Three days, four days, five days. Sometimes seven days' snowfall. It destroyed the trail, it destroyed the camps. HE EXCLAIMS It's gone. Yeah. Well, I'm sure it's still there. Yeah? And I think everything inside will be fine, but, you know, the tent, I don't know, maybe it's broken, the poles may be broken. Isn't that the place...? Somewhere underneath the snow is the tent. From this col, it's come down, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That line leads to the tent. Somewhere underneath the snow. It was just stupid. I mean... He should have been organised one month before. It didn't take much to think about that. If you know that's it's very snowy in February... I mean, it's not snowy like here. Also here you can die from an avalanche. But there, why you want to be there in February? HE STRAINS Yeah! I don't understand. I mean, you lose your life, you're playing with your life. I didn't thought that Tom was so reckless. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. OK, two hours to find the... The tent. The tent. One tent. We need to find also the other one. Under one metre of snow. I think the yetis stole the tent. Do you think we'll find another tent? Tomorrow? We have to find. If we don't find it, we no have more crampons for you and for Rahmat. Yeah, that's a big problem. It's a big problem! So, we arrived to Camp 3, but it doesn't exist any more. Camp 3 is buried underneath the snow. We dug three holes, three tunnels. Can't find anything at all. Um... And now the wind is picking up high up, some very interesting clouds. So...time to go down. We have to go back into base camp, reorganise and then, when the weather is good, try again. In this moment, in this moment, I decided to stop climbing here. Because I felt this is a signal to leave the mountain. I told Daniele, "Look, Daniele, it's time to go out." And what he said - "Karim, I know this mountain very well. "I want to reach the summit." I said, "It's up to you. "I don't want to lose my life here." And I told him... .."I want to go." And he said, "Are you scared?" I said, "No, I'm not scared. "I'm not scared. But I can come back, I can climb again." When Tom brought my gear, which I left in Camp 2, and he brought his harness... ..I thought he would abandon the expedition and join me to return to home. Of course, he was listening the mountains and watching the weather, watching the dangerous conditions. I don't know why he didn't listen at the end, at the last moment, at the last chance. That he continued... This, I didn't understand. And they had to stay almost 20 days after me in base camp. They didn't realise the danger from the mountain. I think Daniele convinced Tom that they can reach the summit. I don't know. I think that guy... Mm-mm. Tom, he never judged people, he never said even half a bad word about anybody. He couldn't even see if a person was using him in any way. And I'm really scared to accuse that he, that guy manipulated him. For sure, I can tell you that Daniele didn't manipulate Tom. It was not manipulation. Tom was really much smarter than this. It was like saying that he was a little bit... ..dumb, you know? A little bit stupid. Tom was brilliant. He was not stupid, not at all. You don't go to Nanga Parbat if you're not really, really committed. I don't know why Tom was committed, but he was. HE SIGHS What a fantastic evening. Look at the light. Incredible. Absolutely stunning. SHOUTS: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar. PRAYER CALL CONTINUES PRAYER CALL CONTINUES I'm a moving rock or a piece of ice... To be in harmony... Pushing your personal limits... Never fighting against... They will always win in the end. ..a way a work with them and to be in harmony. The mountain change you in a way that if you don't experience it, you cannot really understand it. You are... It can make you another person. Things or decisions that here you would never, never take, there, they seem possible. I think that after two months there, probably, they were not like us. Yes, for sure. For sure. They were functioning in another way. Because their body changed deeply, strongly. I think he was skinnier, he lost weight. He didn't look fine. I don't know, I see sufferance in his eyes. I don't know why. I've never been anxious about him that much. I say, "No, stop it, come back." I wanted to buy him a ticket to come back also. The last message I sent him was... ..that I'm not "happy you're climbing" and I said, "It's dangerous." And he says, "Bha." No. "It's my job. If you don't like it, leave me." And I said then, "Better." I mean, because... I don't know. I wasn't happy. I don't know. He sent me a broken heart. That's it. We didn't leave each other in a nice way. It was very hard. And then... ..after a few days, I said, "This has to be the end." SHE CRIES "Love of my life. If I had never told you." I was climbing on K2 at the time, but was asked to lead the search for the two men. Daniele Nardi and Tom Ballard, they had not made contact with base camp for many days. The last communication, it was with Khalid. They were on Camp 4, on the ridge. Can you see the cave? Yes. It's like a cave. Yes. They were somewhere in that area. All of the responsibility from the families, so I can't make any mistake and I said, "I must find. I must find." I'm moving from one side of the helicopter to the other side, from one side... And with one hand, with my camera just recording for something. But I was with my eye, I'm totally focused, I'm cleaning the window. I press a little bit more for the pilots to flew a little bit here, but, "No, Alex, the fuel, the fuel, the fuel, the fuel, "it's too risky, too risky." I told them, "Why we can't do just here, here, here, here, here?" For me, this 35 minutes, they were eternal. I saw something strange in one small rocky point and so I flew with the drone. I saw first a pole, something like black, and then something orange. And I'm thinking in my mind, "Oh, if avalanche crashed to them "and they were in their sleeping bags," it was like... ..a frisson in my body. Uh... And I start digging and digging, digging, digging in the snow. We find a Camp 2 tent from Daniele and Tom totally destroyed. Inside with one sleeping bags, some Epigases, no mattresses. Um... But you can see here, nothing. No evidences of life. Today ten days. Yes. INDISTINCT RADIO REPORT JIM: I think Tom would've found... Well, I don't think. I know Tom would've found the organising rescues and people leaping in and out of helicopters and all that really, really offensive. Tom would never expect anybody to rescue him. Nor would his mother. They would've expected to get themselves off. If you can't get yourselves off when you're playing the game at the top... ..then you don't deserve to come off. You know, the hardest thing for me, Chris, was that I walk in their track, in their track that was made by the foot of Tom and Daniele. This was the hardest moment for me in this rescue action. It was like a message, it was something like, wow... So painful, this moment. On 5th of March, we continued climbing up. We did twice, OK? Up and down, up and down. And we are here in the craziest place that we can be there. This time very dangerous, Mummery. So...I think 200 metres and then we are more safe, no, Ali? But now we are not safe. OK. Not sure. If some seracs are down, we are not safe. Not at this time. MAN SHOUTS MAN SHOUTS We hear all the time the seracs, how they were crashing, you know? And we could not risk any more, any single life or any single second more in this crazy place. So, we moved to the base camp. We were there with the telescope at this point, with the tripod. I took the telescope and I said, "Give me a chance." Ali, Ali! Look...! Come in, come in. Anchor there. Rope. Yes, yes, this is rope. And their bodies are here. You see? Look down. In less than 15 seconds, I found them. In 15 seconds. Look, look, look, Alex, Alex, Alex. I found the anchor here, I followed down there, down there, down there, and immediately here, as you can see here. This is Tom down there on the fixed rope. And up is Daniele. When Alex Txikon found them finally, at last... ..and I knew how they were found, that they were close, and linked with a rope, I thought that at least they were not alone. They were together. Yeah, they were together. MAN SPEAKS SPANISH It was his destiny. I don't know, I don't know if I believe in destiny. We choose, it's our path, and I can't blame anybody about his death, because why? It's not even fair to blame the climber that he was with. He chose to be there. So, it's not fair, it was his choice, and we have to respect it. KATE: Tom was, above all, a solo climber - that's where he excelled. And I have found myself at times thinking, I wish he'd have just stuck to solo climbing. He could've been soloing, it would've been a different outcome for Tom. JIM: Tom was a mountain warrior, his mum was a mountain warrior. You know, Tom will be 30 forever. At the peak of his physical, doing what he wanted to do, where he wanted to do, and if nature took him back, there's nothing we can do. Apart from raise our hats... ..to a life well lived. JIM, IN ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: Are you sad? Hey? Don't be sad. Look, there's a little cloud right against... Can you see that, Tom? There's a little cloud right above the top of K2. Do you think that's your mum waving to you? Can you see there's one little one, look, waving? Looks like an angel's wings. Can you see it? Is that Mummy? It could be. Can you see it? Right above the summit. Yeah. Is that Mummy, Daddy? Well, I think it's a sign that your mum knows you're here. Can you see it, Tom? She's always there, in't she? That's right. She's always there. I wanted to embrace the mountain. I wanted to see what he'd seen. Try and understand what went through his mind. And just try to get a grasp of how he might have felt being here. Nice snow. And I have completely achieved that. And I know what's happened, I know where he's gone, I know that his body's never coming back, but his spirit will live on forever. And it'll live on in me and in the mountains and in everyone that was ever close to him. Do you want to turn and give me a smile? It's almost like Mum's cradling him and they'll be together forever now. I wish I could be with them. But I've still got Dad... ..and Dad and I will pull through this together. And as hard as it is, we know... ..that they did what they wanted to do. Woohoo! Yahoo! It is difficult to not dwell on what's happened, of course. And it's not something that I'm over, in that sense. It'll be an ongoing process, I think, my entire life and it'll get easier, hopefully, in the years to come. But there is only forward to look. There's no point looking back - I'm not going that way. That's a wonderful thing to hear, Kate. That's lovely. I mean, I think since Tom died, Kate and I have developed a bond which is, I suppose, really, truly spiritual, and that's how I feel. And the thing that I never expected to do was be able to share her adventures and joys and sadnesses... ..in a way that gave me unbelievable warmth and pleasure. Coming from a climbing legacy, I always felt just great pride. But because Mum and Tom were so extraordinary, I almost have a duty to them to be extraordinary too and not just be the average Joe and to be a little bit more special. SHE TRILLS My mum and brother, the wind beneath my wings. I can feel your heart beating. It's wonderful. Just like when I carried you over to the window. It was a windowsill I carried you over to when you were born. It was. If I'd known what a nuisance you were, I'd have taken you back! THEY CHUCKLE "Have you got one in blue?" THEY CHUCKLE Go, Kate, go! Keep waving! Ho-ho, well done, lass! ATMOSPHERIC POP MUSIC
