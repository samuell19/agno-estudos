Fixed & Synced by bozxphd.Enjoy The Flick Dropping troops at rally point. We are given two hours! If we fail this mission within that time, our survival will be at stake. We will make sure that the head unit will be able to attack with the new missile! Ready! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! All units have landed. Incoming transmissions from the units. Five meters till they reach the target. Three meters. Two. One. Hey! Cease fire! Cease fire! Stop! Cease fire! Hey! Even if we look at things in a global scale, it would be the same thing. There are people living in low wages around the world. But they have their reasons why they are forced to live that way. That is because only these people are the ones supporting the rich. That's precisely why the weak exists so the strong can live. That's the reason they exist to maintain the high quality of this school. That's the purpose of the Class 3-E. Stand! Attention! Bow! We are killers. And our target... is our teacher. I'll be taking attendance, so please, fire all you like. Yuuma Isogai. Present. Taiga Okajima. Present! Hinata Okano. Present. Manami Okuda. Present. How did we end up in this mess? It started when we just entered our third year. Everyone must welcome this term carefully. I say this especially to the third years. You should thoroughly think how you should undertake your studies. The results will decide what will happen to the rest of your life. I'm not exaggerating here. Best to take it by heart. So that you would not end up like Class 3-E. My apologies. Forgot they're here. The Class E students should at least do their best not interfere with the students of the main building as much as possible. The students that are not at Class E are the chosen ones. The elite. Face this year having that in mind. Starting today, we are the "E for End Class", huh? So that means our "End" is soon too. Yes. We are the drop out class who failed to meet the high level of the elite Kunugigaoka Middle School. Also known as "E for End Class". Our class is hidden in an old building at a mountaintop. And we are always made fun of the other classes. And what suddenly appeared before us was... I am the one who tore the chunk out of your moon. I plan to do the same to the Earth by March next year. But until then, I will be your firm teacher. Nice to meet all of you. What do you mean? Move! I'm Karasuma, from the Ministry of Defense. You might not fully grasp what he's saying. Let me explain. Please understand that what I'm about to say is classified information. Let me be blunt: I want you to kill this creature. I still don't get what you're saying. What he said is the truth. This creature who destroyed the moon, will also destroy Earth by March next year. Only the world's leaders know about this. We would like to ask all of you to secretly cooperate before there would be global panic. IN OTHER WORDS: An assassination. But here's the catch: His speed is unmatched. As you can see, when you try to kill him, he ends up grooming your hair instead - immaculately. That's because his speed tops out at Mach 20. In short, if he actually wanted to get away from us, before the Earth's destruction, we wouldn't be able to do a thing to stop him. Since there is no fun in that, I made your government an offer. I don't mind being killed as long as I became a firm teacher of this Kunigigaoka Middle School's Class 3-E. That is the situation. In order to kill him, you're going to use these specially made BB pellets and knives that the Ministry of Defense produced. Pellets and knives are not that dangerous for middle school students like you to use. That's why we chose these weapons. These are particularly harmless to most humans. But these weapons have especially a lethal effect against him. I'll regenerate after a few seconds anyway. He made an agreement with the government to never harm you. We don't know his reasons but we agreed to his conditions. In other words, the thirty of you as his pupils have an opportunity to kill him from extremely close range. The reward for a successful assassination is 10 billion yen. 10 billion yen?! Nagisa Shiota. Present. Since then, Mr Karasuma from the Ministry of Defense, became the assistant firm teacher to train us in our assassination. Furthermore, someone was also hired to support Mr Karasuma. Ms Irina Jelavic. I heard that she is a highly skilled professional assassin. At first, she was sent to kill this powerful creature but... She was changed into a wholesome, retro PE outfit. I don't understand the details. But something beyond my imagination happened to her. She's so cute. Since then, she became our English teacher. Touka Yada. Present. Taisei Yoshida. Present. I'm relieved nobody is late. But not one of your bullets hit me. That's too bad. I hope you get to kill me before graduation. That's how we, the E for End Class, became students of the assassination classroom. [ ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM ] Look at your target! Yes sir! Okay. Next! Good luck! Go! Would it be better if I moved closer? Hey, Nagisa. Did you note down that octopus's weaknesses? Yeah. This is all I can do to help anyway. His face changes color, huh? That's worthless. But I wonder if it would really work. The hell? Don't back out now. I don't intend to but... I think we should plan this out more carefully. Whatever we end up coming up with, we're just the E Class losers who'll just spend our lives as scum. This is our chance. Nagisa. Let's do it in our Japanese language class. Let's make a short poem for today's lesson. The final line should be "was tentacles all along." I'll be looking for proper grammar and whether you've aptly conveyed the tentacle's beauty. Be sure to write the phrase. When you're finished, bring them to me. I'm done. Already, Nagisa? Please let me read it. Didn't I tell you to be more inventive? Huh? What's wrong, Nagisa? Gotcha! Yes! 10 billion's ours! Hell yeah! Nagisa! - Hey Nagisa! - You okay? Don't be a worrywart, Kayano. Hey! What did you give to Nagisa?! It's just a toy grenade filled up with anti-teacher pellets. But I modified and beefed it up with gunpowder. See now? It'll just kill that **** octopus. It won't kill humans. Our 10 billion yen'll cover his medical bills no prob! He's covered with something like a membrane. Huh? What's this? It's connected to that octopus's corpse? As it happens, I shed my skin once a month. The old skin took all of the fire power. In other words, it's my once a month ace up my sleeve. Anyway. Terasaka, Yoshida, Muramatsu. You three are responsible for this, aren't you? I will not harm you. That's the agreement I've made with the government. - The nameplates of our houses?! - He just took them? But if you try to the same thing like this again, I might just harm someone else. Your family, your friends. Maybe I'll kill everyone on the planet except you. We have no reason to kill him. But we have no choice... but to kill our teacher. You've got long ways to go as assassins. But your idea itself was a very good one. Especially you, Nagisa. The way you carried yourself so naturally on your approach gets full marks from me. You did an excellent job making it past my defenses. However, none of you three looked out for Nagisa. And even Nagisa himself did not. Students like that aren't fit to assassinate anyone. We need an assassination worth smiling about and be proud of. You all are capable assassins who have the power within you. Just a few words of advice from your teacher and target. Okay everyone. Please go back to your seats. By the way, you're our teacher. Do you have a name? Nope. I don't think so. Then how about "Korosensei"? Since he's an unkillable teacher. Good name! I'm somewhat moved! Korosensei, huh? Korosensei. Korosensei! That's me! You won't be able to hit me if you keep missing, you know. What's going on? We placed a trap yesterday. A trap? It's like whenever catching a beetle, you put sugared water on a tree the day before. What kind of primitive trap did you set? Well, since last night, we placed a newly published dirty mag featuring big boobs. Korosensei fell into it this morning! Why would he even dress up like a beetle? He fell into such simple trap? Observe how great I move side by side! Oh no. Now! You won't be able to catch me here! There's a large gap with our abilities, idiots! That's unfair! Get down here! I have something to announce to all of you. I'll doubling today's homework. Like we'll do that! Petty! Small-minded. Why can't we kill him? Hey. Isn't that Karma? I could assume you were the student that was suspended. I'm Karma Akabane. Welcome to Class 3-E. Please teach me well. Do your best with assassinating me together with everyone in class... I'm surprised you fell into such simple move. Are you actually slow, Sir? Heard about the knives specially made to kill you. I've tested and inserted some in my hand. It's really effective against you. The reason he got suspended was because of the violent behaviour during 2nd year. Even though he's good in class, he still ends up in Class E. Karma is good with fights and foul play. Maybe among us students in the assassination classroom, he might simply be the top of the class. Karma Akabane. He already got full marks even though he just got back. Now then, how should I guide him. Good morning everyone! Oh my. Whoops! My bad! I killed that creature thinking it was you. Bring it here. I'll dispose of it. I'll start by slowly destroying your soul. Now, now, Karma. Allow me to show you the power of these drill tentacles and this missile I filched from the Self Defense-Force. I'm not about to let my assassin get away scot-free. Hot! I could tell by your pallor that you hadn't eaten breakfast, you see. So I whipped up a batch of takoyaki at Mach speed. Takoyaki? With these, you'll be well on your way to being nice and healthy. Ah, I also got to give you a little nail art. Are you done over there? It has this kind of sharp tang to it. Well, why don't you start over? Toss that batch out. You forgot your apron, Karma. How cute! Don't worry about the soup. I collected it all in midair with an eyedropper. I added a little sugar while I was at it, too. Hmm. It's much milder now. You're really good at cooking. That's because I've been living alone for a long time now. Karma. Looks like you went wild again. Heard it's six versus one? The PTA from other school might file a complaint. But I think you did the right thing. But even though you get into fights easily, I'll always be on your side! Too bitter! It's unsweetened?! It's bad. I should have gotten the sweetened one. The hell you're thinking? What's so funny? Say, Nagisa. Hmm? What kind of guy is he? Korosensei's a bit weird but he's a good teacher. Even though he's a powerful who can destroy the world but everyone is saying he's quite good at teaching. It's a good thing he's doing his job as a teacher. But still, there are orders to kill him, huh? Karma. That surprised me. You see, I'm also sharpening the dull and rusty skills of assassins. As you observed, I've certainly taken good care of you today. Please go ahead and still try to kill me. I'll polish you up even shinier. I want to ask... Would you be able to risk your life to protect one of your students? Of course. I'm a teacher after all. If that's so... Then I'll be able to kill you. For sure. Stop it! Hey! Give it back! I beg you! How dare you! You okay with this? Don't worry about it. You're my senior. Just because you're at E Class, I can't just let them bully you. You're in the wrong! What were you thinking siding with the E Class and hurt students from A class who had a bright future ahead?! If something bad happens to them, it'll be on my head! He let me down. Now he's dead to me. You'll get killed by my shot if you come and rescue me. If you let me die, you're good as dead as a teacher. Now, which death would you choose? Karma, splendid job on the premeditated assassinations starring yourself. If I'd saved you at Mach speed, your body wouldn't have been able to take it, and if I'd move slowly, I'd have been hit. So I thought I'd try a stickier approach. What can't these tentacles do?! Oh, and for the record: Letting you die is not an option for me. Feel free to take a leap of faith any time you like. It's no use. He won't die, no matter what I do. Not the teacher part of him, anyway. Korosensei. Yes? I'll be sure to kill you someday. I'm looking forward to it. Why does he, as a teacher, go that far for us as his students? It has been two months since that mysterious creature destroyed the moon. Although the world leaders have agreed to entrust it all to us Japanese, military satellites and ballistic missiles are still sent to destroy the super creature. And I'm afraid along with whole of Japan. But it has been reported that any of those attacks have been stopped by the super creature. And in the end, we ended up being protected by him. It's ironic. If this goes on, we won't be able to stop him of destroying the world before March. Even though I intended to let you handle this, looks like I don't see any progress at all. My apologies, Sir. But we'll be sending a transfer student. A transfer student? Yes. Could the student be a new assassin? But the student's not in perfect condition yet. The student has a possibility to go out of control. She's Autonomously Thinking Fixed Artillery. She's a boxed robot equipped with artifical intelligence. Box? Why in a box? Starting today, she'll be your new classmate in E Class. Please get along with her. This must be rough for him. Don't laugh. You're no better than her. Listen well. She'll always be aiming her guns at you, but under no circumstances can you hurt a student. In other words, you cannot fight back. I see. You're exploiting a loophole in my teaching agreement to call a machine my student. Very well. I will welcome her in open arms for the E Class. Thank you, Korosensei. Commencing attack. Hey, hey, hey, hey! I see. There are four gatling guns, and two machine guns. That's a veritable cascade of bullets, but it's just what I've come to expect from my students. You are indeed strong. Now we'll see what she's made of. She has the ability to evolve. Evolve? So this is the latest military technology. Hey, what do you think you're doing?! That's dangerous! Recalculating line of fire. Correcting aiming angle. Entering auto-evolution phase five-alpha. When the Hojo clan let Kujou Yoritsune be the shogun, his political administration continued as is. But when the Emperor Go-Toba attacked the shogun, the Joukyuu War started. Will you ever learn? Are we supposed to clean this up? Don't you have a vacuum cleaner there? Missy Fixed Artillery? What's the point of teasing a machine? Probability of killing the target with the next attack: 0.001% Probability of killing the target WITH THE ATTACK AFTER THAT: 0.005%. Probability of killing the target before graduation: Greater than 90%. I cannot deploy my guns like this. Please remove my restraints. Listen here. You're disturbing class every time you start firing. Don't you have common sense? Besides, who do you think ends up cleaning up bullets you fire? Yeah! Yeah! Do you understand what went wrong? I do not. You are a student, and a transfer student at that. You should try to come up with ways to get along with your classmates on your own. Get along? Yes. I do not know how to do that. I thought so. I brought here data from all of your classmates from the E Class. You are the master of the artificial intelligence who has a natural ability to evolve. Think of it thoroughly by using its full potential. Good morning everyone! I've thought it thoroughly using my artificial intelligence. I thought how I would be able to get along with everyone. That's when it hit me to make an app of myself! App? Now that I'm an app, I will be able to support everyone's assassinations! It's cool that this app has a lot of features we can really use! I'm happy that I would be of help! I'll hold off my own assassination attempts so that I can learn how to work together. Hey guys! Since "Autonomously Thinking Fixed Artillery" is long, from "jiritsu" meaning "autonomous", why don't we call her "Ritsu"? "Ritsu"? Yes! Please call me by that name! Kayano! You got a talent in thinking up names! Ritsu, let's get along. It's a good thing she's not some weird transfer student. I know right. What's wrong? There's another student that will be transferred today. Transfer student? Good morning! - Good morning. - Good morning! Okay then. I'll be taking attendance. Who is he? But what the?! Why from the roof?! I've proved I'm stronger than this school. What is he talking about? Hey, Itona. Don't do that. You should properly come in using the door. I apologize for the fuss. I am his guardian. As you can see, I'm dressed in white. So kindly call me "Shiro" as in "white". He is Itona Hirobe. I was trained in assassinations together with him. I see. Now he's the transfer student then. Oh my. You sure made a showy entrance. You. You might be the strongest in this class. But don't fret. You're weaker than me. I won't kill you. The only ones I want to kill... are those who could be stronger than me. In this classroom you're the only one worthy, Korosensei. Welcome to Class 3-E. I can kill you. Really now. The reason is we're brothers by blood. They are brothers?! I will kill you and prove my strength. We face off after school. Here, in this classroom. Let's set a rule, Korosensei. How about... "Stepping out of the ring means instant death." What do you think? All right. Well then. Assassination... begin! Wow. You're still developing tentacles? Where did you get those tentacles?! My, what a scary face you're making. Did you perhaps remember something unpleasant? Since he also has tentacles, you can consider him your brother, right? That's Korosensei's ace up one's sleeve. He used it this early? You've just exhausted your energy with regenerating your tentacle and shedding your skin. That would also mean that your speed would decline. Fighting with someone with tentacles makes it a big difference. Brother. I am stronger than you. After shedding off skin and have his tentacles cut three times, Korosensei's speed is down by 48.8%. The probability that he would die in the next attack: 60%. He got Korosensei cornered. In a few moments, the world will be saved. And yet... I don't want Korosensei be killed by Itona. This is the first time anyone's pressed me this hard. Though I'd like to ask a few things. But let me win this round first. That's some bellowing of a cornered octopus. Itona, finish him. What's this? Looks like you have stepped on something. If we have the same tentacles, then these anti-teacher knives should work the same too. And the loss of a tentacle wanes us both. If you want to kill me, stay with the other students of this class. If you don't take my experience from here in this classroom, you'll never be able to beat me. Since you're wrapped up with my shedding, you're probably unscathed. But... You're already outside of the ring, Itona. It means it's my win! I am... stronger... I have something to ask of you. They're anti-teacher fibers. Don't worry. He'll be back before long. Korosensei. I wonder why he's that angry. Kayano? I know right. - Bye, Sir! - Goodbye! Korosensei. Yes? Why did you come teach us in E Class? You see, I decided to become your teacher to protect a promise I made to someone. What promise? I can't tell you yet. There is no reason to tell you that now. Besides, when I destroy the Earth, everything I will tell you will all be gone too. But on the contrary, if you were able to save the Earth, you would be able to find out every truth there is. Do you see it now? There is only one course of action for you to know why. You should assassinate me. Is there anything we can do right now that we would be able to kill you someday? How about we spend the weekend at school to study?! Stay at school yet study? Yes. I too will spend the weekend with you all. Then that would mean that we would be together much longer! So it means chances of assassinating you would also increase. That's correct! This should be called "Assassination Training Camp"! And the Assassination Training Camp started. What is Hydrogen ion's H+? It is when it loses an electron. Correct. So the electrolyte at an aqueous solution will produce electricity and will receive electrons. Korosensei uses his mach speed to teach each one of us separately with targeted revisions for our worst subjects. Korosensei. Doesn't it exhaust you to keep all your afterimages? Not to worry, Kanzaki. Please take a look outside. I've got one resting there. But that would make you even more tired! He has bad efficiency with his afterimages. You're incredible in bed. The pronunciation of "r" in "incredible" should be like when you are kissing. Just like when your pointed lips get narrower. - "ru" - that's how you pronounce it. Got it, Ms ! I told you to not slur it. Besides, your pronunciation is wrong. My name starts with this "V". It's pronounced slightly biting your lower lip - "vic". Understood? I got it now Ms ! I bloody told you, it's wrong! That would make it mean some lewd lady! Ryuunosuke Chiba and Rinka Hayami. They have accurate timing and aim precisely. In terms of marksmanship, these two are leading. Yuuma Isogai and Hiroto Maehara. Their sense of using knives is good. And in some cases, the possibility they will land a stab against me increases. Terasaka, Muramatsu, and Yoshida. Even though they lack the sense of motivation in training, these three have have above average reflexes. I believe that they have great military potential once they are in combat. And there's also him. Nagisa Shiota. So who? I prefer the well-bred Kanzaki. Me too. Kanzaki sure is popular! Hey! Where are you going?! What? What're you doing? Ah! There! Hey! Where are we going?! Whoa! What?! Hey! We're going to the bathroom! I just took a bath awhile ago! Idiot! We're going to the girls' bathroom. Huh? We have to find out how much they grew. That hurt! Then we're off to take a bath! Have fun! Hey, hey. If this training goes on, we might really be able to assassinate him! Then we'll get 10 billion! We don't even have to go to school anymore! We can just play around the rest of our lives! Listen well, girls. Assassinations are not that simple. Professional assassins properly train themselves. Wow. Miss **** is saying something decent. What?! Miss, Miss, Miss! Who do you think is the greatest assassin there is? Number one is... the death ripper, Shinigami. Shinigami? Nobody knows his true name. We don't even know if he exists or not. But if we still can't kill that octopus, that Shinigami might show himself. Then... Let's change topic. Yeah. Let us hear all the guys you turned down, Miss ****. That sounds good! I want to hear too! This is going to be too exciting. Everybody come closer! When I was 17... Oh, 17... - Hey you! - Me? You should not be in the girls' room! Aaah! Why not? I also want to hear that story of your colourful love. Then how about you, Korosensei? Tell us about your love life. He ran off! Get him! Hold it! Tell us, Korosensei! Come on, tell us! Korosensei! He's not here! Where are you, Korosensei? Crap! What? What's going on?! What do you think you're doing here?! I am not Nagisa. I am Kayano. Starting tomorrow? Is this decision final? Okay. Understood, Sir. You've been making quite a ruckus. The students are forcing me talk about my love life. Do you even have a love life? I also have stories of my love life to tell you know. Too many that I can't count with my limbs. Could that be... when you once had only two pairs of limbs? Hmm... How harsh of you. With these hands... I'm sure you will be... So? What do you think? That's the results of the Assassination Training Camp. Their assassination skills have leveled up. But it's still not in the level to be able to kill me. That's the reality, at least. - You've been here long, Ayaka? - Not really. Have you solved the assignment I gave you yesterday? Yeah. It was easy. Good to hear. What do you want, E Class? - Let's go, Ayaka. - Yeah. Should I teach you again after classes? Yeah, I want you teach me other topics. Starting today, as Sir Karasuma's substitute, I will be in charge of PE. The name's Takaoka! Okay! First things first! Eat up! Ah! That's baumkuchen from Kashi no Ki shop! Come on and eat up! Go on! Come on! Thanks for the treat! Come on and eat up! Go on! Don't hold back and just eat! But don't get the wrong idea that I'm just luring you in! I just want to get along with all of you. Go on and help yourselves! Go on! Go on and eat. Help yourselves! He's Akira Takaoka. We were together in the airborne brigade. I understand that he's a far better instructor than I. Since we're not making progress, we have to find new ways to assassinate you.. I see. You and Sir Karasuma are like night and day. I know right! You're like a neighborhood dad! Dad, huh? I like that! We're in the same class, so that makes us family, right? Alright! From now on, we are a family! You can rely on me on anything like a dad! Daddy! I did some research from the Ministry of Defense. It seemed like your colleague, Takaoka, thought of you as his greatest rival. But he thinks he's no match for you. Looks like he also applied to the same position as an instructor. His method is to be close to his students like a family. I heard he trains a faithful team in a short period of time, by becoming like a violent father under dictatorship. This the result of his training. What is this? Surprised? Looks like their morales and bodies ended up in pieces. Our men can easily be manipulated. Huh? Looks like their morales and bodies ended up in pieces. Doing good! 20 laps left! Come on! Only an hour left! What's this? Come on now! Give it all for your last spurt! Last spurt! Oh mushroom! You're doing great! Go all out! Go! Go! Go! Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Are you okay, Kanzaki? - As your dad, I will make sure... - I can't do it anymore. I'd rather have Sir Karasuma's class. Kanzaki! - Kanzaki! - Are you okay? How dare you talk back to your dad. - Stop that, Sir! - Sir! You're a bad girl. Somebody stop him! If you want to get violent, get violent with me. Heh. You're already getting in the way? They are middle school students first before soldiers. They will still lead their hopeless lives even if they studied. That's why I'm giving them discipline. How about we face off as teachers? Choose the best student you trained among them. I will fight barehanded with that student. And if their knife even touches me once, I'll concede that your style of education is better than mine and I'll take my leave. But! We will be using this knife. The student's target will be me, a human being. So naturally, the student would need a real knife. But the students haven't used... Relax. Stopping just before contact will still count as a hit. Come on! Choose! I'm bare-handed anyway! What more of a handicap do you want? As someone who charged you with an assassination mission to save the world, I consider you all fellow professionals. And speaking as a professional, I believe the least you deserve in return is the guarantee of a normal middle school life. So you don't have to take this knife if you don't want to. Don't make me wait, Karasuma! Choose a student! Will you do it? Nagisa. What? Nagisa? What? He'll lose. You'll lose, Nagisa! Please leave it to me. Takaoka will treat this match as a real combat. So he has to demonstrate his strength. But for you, it's an assassination. Just make one good contact. Understood, Sir. This trick worked wonders even at JSDF. Unarmed, I'd beat down a terrified new recruit who had never held a real knife before. Everyone there saw how much I outranked them. They eventually became my faithful devotees. I don't have to fight him to win. I just need to kill him. You **** brat! How dare you turn on your father figure! I demand a rematch! I won't be off guard this time around! True. If we'd fought again, I'd lose for sure. And I'm really grateful that your training us to make us stronger. But... Our firm teacher is Korosensei. And our training instructor is Sir Karasuma. I'm sorry. Please leave. Don't think I'm done with you. Whoa, Nagisa! What are you?! You're amazing! One-two! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! I see you've noticed it too. He has the natural talent in assassinations. But because Takaoka didn't know that, he let his guard down. Even if he looks weak, for an assassin, it's a formidable talent. The E Class is truly training a wide variety of talented assassins. As to who will be able to successfully assassinate me, I'm very much looking forward to it. Sudden strong rains are common these days, huh? That's why it feel so damp and humid. Hey guys! Korosensei's coming! - He's coming! Let's do it! - Yeah, let's! Okay everyone. Please take your seats. Whoa! Your head is really swollen! Oh no! There is a leak at the roof! Okay then. Let's start our science class. We'll be conducting an experiment about oxidation reduction. Korosensei. Yes? Uh, umm... This is poison! I put my heart and soul in making it! Please drink it! My, what an honest assassination. I cannot let go of this chance! I will gladly drink it. He's drinking it?! W-what is this?! What a blank white face! This tastes like sodium hydroxide. It's poisonous to humans, but not to me, I'm afraid. Either way, I'm surprisingly delighted with your ways of assassination, Okuda. Before tomorrow, I would gladly teach you how to make an even stronger poison. Really? He powered up! Here I come! Here I come! Here I come! Please try to catch me. Ah. I can also do that. I'm here. No, here. Not really, I'm here. And also here. Look closely where I am. Time to fly around like always! There he is! What I taught you, Okuda, was actually a tonic to stimulate my cells. You tricked me, Korosensei? You have long ways to go to be tricked by this scheme. Okuda, your grades at science are magnificent. But please work harder in your weak subjects like Japanese. Now then. Please arrange your seats back. Let's go back to our lessons. The hell with studying! Yeah! We're the E Class after all! It won't make a difference even if our grades just got a bit higher. Assassinating you is more accessible to us rather than study. With the 10 billion reward, we can live the good life. We won't be able to assassinate you if you don't hold back. You don't have what it takes to be assassins yet. Please call Sir Karasuma, and Ms Irina. Then gather at the school yard. I have a question to all of you. Do you really want to kill me? Ms Irina, there's something I'd like to ask you as a professional assassin. Me? When you're on a job, do you prepare just one plan of attack? No. Making detailed backup plans in preparation for any possibility is a basic tenet of assassination. - Now a question to Sir Karasuma. - Yes? When fighting with a knife, is the first strike only the important one? If against a powerful foe, your first blow is likely to be dodged. So the precision with which you can land your second and third blows can decide the fight. That's right. A confident assassin always has a backup plan they can rely on. But you said "We've got an assassination, and that's enough." And you think that there is no need for you to study at all. What if I fled from this classroom? What if another killer got to me first? If you just stake everything on this assassination for nothing, all you've got left is the good old E Class inferiority. Those who can't wield a second blade, aren't qualified to be assassins. What's he doing?! I am a superbeing capable of wiping out the Earth. Fetching military weapons to this school yard is a piece of cake. If you can't show me a second blade you can depend upon, I'll know that none of you are assassins worthy of taking me on. And I will just vanish. If you remember, you blamed me that I tricked Okuda awhile ago. But you lied and tricked me! No matter how potent the poison you make, having the Japanese verbal aptitude to deceive others is a vital part of assassination. I'm sure that one day, your scientific talents will benefit many. But you'll need to explain things clearly to as many people as possible. So please develop your language skills that you can poison two birds with one vial. Magnificent assassins excel in everything. That's why all of you must also do well in the end-of-term exams. Anyway... For the upcoming end-of-term exams, I have come up with the perfect goal for assassinating me. Each student who receives a top score in a subject, will have the right to destroy one of my tentacles. Your tentacle? You heard it right. Now, everyone. I think you are now aware of this, Whenever I lose a tentacle, I also lose speed. Eew. Gross~. As you can see, even if I only lost one tentacle, I already have a hard time keeping the quality of my after-images. Now there's a few child images mixed in. - It's small! - Wow! So cute! Come here. So that's how his after-images are reduced? To continue, if I lose one more, Go! Chocoranger! Tentacle Kick! Sucker Punch! I get more child images, with the parent images fretting about how to make ends meet. This has taken a rather heartbreaking turn. And lose yet another, Now the father image has vanished, leaving the mother image to raise the children on her own. Even if it's cold, even though she's unsure, she waits for an octopus. She sighs and say, "I want to make things easier." "No! I must not think that way!" "If I let it this way, my children won't live!" That's heavy stuff. Anyway! My speed loses whenever I lose a tentacle. The possibility of assassinating me increases! That's what I mean. You're just saying, you just want to give motivation for us to study. This is our chance, everyone! Let's study hard! Their moods have changed. Yes. Important knowledge is needed for assassinations. Verbal aptitude, mathematics, chemistry, history of the terrain and its geography, English skills. If you understand people and the land, you'll understand the sky! Things learned in assassinations, can surely be used in the test. And what they experience in the tests can also be used in assassinations. Studies and assassinations go hand in hand, huh? That's why I can't help but look forward how they will assassinate me. Don't drink tea while your fixated looking at my boobs! Yes. This tea is delicious. Still drinking this tea. Well then. Shall I proceed with the finishing touches? - "Laugh off" - "Dismissing it as trivial!" - "Strike on". What was it again? I forgot! That's "recall". Right! How're you going to use it again? Hmm... For example... Like "Strike on a solution to the problem." Huh? I may be wrong though. I forgot! Got it. See you then. Thanks! Bye bye! “Pay up”. "Passion." Whoa! Korosensei! You really look out of place when you're outside of school. What?! Really? Anyway, why are you here? Right. Nakamura, as someone who just returned to Japan, I'm going to further sharpen your English skills. I'm now going to give you a special lesson using first hand experience. What? Let's go to a place where we can hear English first hand. Whaaat?! Okay. Next. Wait! We're leaving already?! Off to the jagged deserts where the pyramids were occupied by successive pharaohs! Kindly compute how high and low the Great Wall of China is. Kayano, let's compute how large is the angle of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. We've also taken enough pictures for a graduation album. This truly is two birds with one stone. I'm really looking forward for tomorrow's exam. This is the very first topnotchers of the E Class! Nakamura, Okuda, and Karma! These three magnificently topped the whole year level in English, Science, and Mathematics! You can do it if you try! And everyone else also have improved tremendously! You all did well! I'm very happy for you! So? What about your agreement?! Thank you! I deeply thank you! - Your agreement! - Wow, Kayano. Have you cut your hair? Ah. He's changing the topic. I didn't get a haircut! Come on, your agreement! A-gree-ment! A-gree-ment! A-gree-ment! A-gree-ment! Ah, right. You mean my tentacles, huh? Understood. So three tentacles. - You've got it wrong! - What?! There's English, Science, and Math. There are five subjects! Japanese, Math, English, Science, - and Home Ec! - Home Economics?! Nobody said what subjects we had to ace! It's impossible for us to top the general subjects, We three got perfect scores at Home Ec! - Wow! - In other words... Adding the first three who aced, we can now destroy six tentacles! Six! Six?! If I lost that many, I will slow down and end up dying! Let's hold our Korosensei assassination assembly during our summer vacation! Yeah! Yes! Come on and cut it already! You're a man! Ah! Look out! Wood! Wood, wood, wood! - July 22nd. That's Saturday, right? - Yeah. What time? G^2 = 3pi. That's 675pi square meters. That means... Um... We need 2.12 kilolitres. Right. 2.12 kilolitres. Come on boys! Help us out here! Come on! Hurry! You okay? Come on, girls! Look! Guys too! Come on! We now begin the council of war for our assassination show! Oh. Today's the fireworks parade. But I guess, we don't have time to watch. We're finally doing the assassination assembly tomorrow. We might even pull an all-nighter, huh? Ah! Wait! Don't go! Wait! Ah! Sorry! Thanks. Sure. That looks good on you. What? The yukata. Oh. Thanks. Nagisa. Hmm? You seem to be having lots of fun recently. What? It seems like you're more cheerful. Really? Nagisa! Let's go! Okay! - See you then. - Yeah. Come on! Dash! Almost there! - Put more strength in it! - But it's really heavy! Are you really pushing? I am pushing! It's darn heavy! Tamayaaa! It's really beautiful! Come to think of it, can we really kill him tomorrow? We have no choice but to do it! Well, we gave good results in the end-of-terms exams. We can do it if we try. "You can do it if you try". I remember Ms Yukimura said that. Hmm? Yukimura? Remember? Towards the end of our second year, we had a female firm teacher. Even though we're at E Class, she's the teacher that said we can do it if we try! Ah! Her! I remember she was really friendly! Yeah. But wait. She's not here anymore when we became senior. Where'd she go? Beats me. I guess we didn't really care. Probably... Tamayaaaa! Because we had a new teacher. True. So tomorrow's the day. Everyone. I'm looking forward for your all out assassination. Especially your serious efforts of creativity and ingenuity. I can't help but feel excited what you have in store for me. Don't hold back. Come right at me. Alright! Yeah! Let's do it! Whoa! So pretty! Tamayaaa! Korosensei! Don't run until we shoot you, okay? Please be gentle with me. Let's get started. Okay! Okay! Wait! Please hold on! W-what's this?! Once we destroyed your tentacles and your movement slowed down, you will be caged inside water. You're weak against water, right? You knew? I've been noting down your weaknesses. During the humid rainy season, you bloat up, and you frantically defended yourself from a leak in the roof. I've thought you might be avoiding water. Relax. We'll quickly put you in peace. Come on guys. Let's do this. One... Two... Three! Now! One, two! You've done well to come this far. Ah... That hurt. Kayano. You okay? What happened? Korosensei's gone? Huh? Where'd he go? No way! For real?! What is this?! Is this the octopus? The exterior is crystallized, high-density condensed energy. I would not be affected by water nor anti-teacher substances. This is my absolute defense form! - Tera. - Yeah? That won't work. Even nuclear bomb wouldn't leave a scratch. It's no use. So if you stay in that form, we can never kill you! This energy crystal will break down in around 24 hours. Then how about we caged you inside a pool filled with anti-teacher materials? Are you thinking that I would just end up melting by the time I get back to my original form? Yeah. In that case, I'll just explode myself like awhile ago, and the surroundings will just blow up too. Huh?! ! Hey! Kanzaki! Hey! Kanzaki! What's wrong with you guys?! Takebayashi? Guys! - They got a high fever! - What?! Are you okay? You're precious students sure are in agony! Takaoka. Did you do this?! It's from the newly made virus you drank! Once infected, you'll end up dead after three days! The only antidotes that exist are with me. Stop right there! Make the wrong move and I'll break this! Do you think you'll get away with this?! I've become a laughingstock at the Ministry of Defense of you! Nagisa Shiota! With your. Whenever their humiliating glances, and that trick you pulled on me with a knife cross my mind, I get itchy and can't even sleep at night! That's why I think it would be right to make you suffer a little. Though these antidotes will save them. But first, hand him over. Karasuma. The lives of the students are at stake. We have no choice. Please hold on. Do you think he will just hand over the antidotes? This negotiation seems off. What's taking you so long?! Look out! I want to kill that teacher no matter what it takes. Karasuma! Irina. Take the students to a safe place. I am... the strongest. Hand... him. Come on! Nagisa! But how did he ended up being a ball? That monster is full of surprises. Do it. The 10 billion is mine. Hey! Come on! Have you forgotten about this? I wonder how's everyone. You must not the two of them at the same time. You must only stop Itona for now. Got it. Place ice bags in their heads and give antipyretics to those with high fever. Give painkillers to those who suffers from headaches and stomachaches. Yes, Sir! I'll go get water. Nagisa! N-Nagisa? You're kidding, right? Please catch me Nagisa! Karma! Nice catch! Okay. Karma, 12 o'clock! That's Sir Karasuma's defensive technique! Even though you're always skip training, looks like you've stealing glances and learned how to dodge knives. Aaah! Heeey! Stop it! Karma? That's... a... bit... painful. Karma! You got me. Stop. I told you, I give up. Okay? I'm no match to you. I'll hand Korosensei. Take your time in killing. Right, Nagisa? Yeah. You're right. Psych! Hand him... over. I am... stronger than him. Did you know it would rain? We did it, Nagisa. Yeah. I see. That's why you chose this day to commence the assassination assembly because you know there would be rain. This is our second blade. "If you understand people and the land, you'll understand the sky!" So this is what it meant. Itona? If you stayed at E Class, you'll be far more greater assassin. What do you think? How about studying with all of them? Oh. It's from Ritsu. Oh! Glad you came back in one piece! I thought you'd go running away and leave them. But playtime's over. And preparations are all in order. Hand over that monster. I'd have her go inside the tub with him. See? Nagisa! Instead of water, I'll bury them with heaps of cement! Korosensei! The only way for you to get away with the anti-teacher pellets you must explode together with her. But sadly, a good teacher like won't do that and would just silently give in and melt. Come on and hand him over. You still don't get it? You sure you don't need these? Come on! Korosensei faced us, the sunken E Class, head on. The hell? That's why! Please let us be the one to kill him! What? I beg you. What great scene! But you know, when one is bowing that low, this would happen! What's so funny, ?! Answer me! Here. You should've hand him over from the start. To think it you were darn fast but now you're just a ball! The hell is this?! Is it warm enough? It's perfect! It feels so good that I can't move! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Okuda. Splendid job in making the antidotes. You just taught me well, Korosensei. Thanks to Ritsu, we understood the situation by letting everyone know. That's why I made the app! Nagisa. While making the antidote, you were perfectly vigilant. And to think you even bowed down, that was a magnificent performance. Not at all. Let us hold on to him from now on. We can't blow him even using nuclear energy. That's why we've prepared a cutting edge shelter. Using this, we can most likely save the Earth. What you've done so far are those of professional assassins. You highly deserve such respect. He has some final words. He's online. Having persevered the training, I'm sure you have mastered some skills. And because you diligently studied, you learned great amounts of knowledge. As a result, as assassins, you've matured in amazing leaps. It's alright to feel frustrated The reason is... All the military troops in the world had never cornered me this far. This is the solid proof of your growth as assassins. Commencing injection of the anti-special-creature-ball. There is no equal amount of happiness as a teacher to see his students grow. I am pleased... Truly happy that I became everyone's... teacher until the end... Thank you. Third Year... E Class... It's time. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1… The super creature is completely destroyed! Huh?! What?! Korosensei! Jerk! Heh. Why you! Stand! Attention! Bow! Commencing attack. - Karma Akabane. - Present. - Yuuma Isogai. - Present. The second term started. E Class completely became the assassination classroom again. Mr President, do you request any changes concerning E Class's further activities? None whatsoever. Do you remember what I told you first time we met? "To maintain the high quality of this school." "The E Class are needed to be weak." I can see in their eyes that they are slowly flowing with confidence. It might be because of that creature. They must stop thinking they can also do anything if they tried. They always have to live their lives with no hope. Well then. Set aside your guns and bullets. We will start with our lessons. There is one thing that changed from the first term. What? Itona started attending to classes. Are you listening? There is one more creature besides Itona in that classroom. It seems like things would get more interesting. If you give me your time, please teach the children. You have wonderful tentacles. With these hands... I'm sure... You will become a wonderful teacher to the children... Your class... has become this magnificent. Ms Yukimura. Well then. Nobody got to hit me again today. It would be nice if you could kill me before you graduate. [ KOROSENSEI ] [ KAZUNARI NINOMIYA ] Hope it helped -> bozxphd
