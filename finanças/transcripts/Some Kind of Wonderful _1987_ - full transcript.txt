Run, run, run. He's gonna get you. Good. He's dead. It's semi-conscious Keith. Hi, ugly. - Hi, honey. How was work? - All right. Keith, you still haven't told me when you're gonna cut your hair. I got it cut, Mom. Mom, you're flapping your lips in vain. Keith vacated. Keith! Keith, is that you? - Yup. - Hey, pal. Been checking out some colleges. Dad, you going to college? That's great. If I'd have gone to college, I wouldn't be selling tires six days a week. That's what you're gonna be doing if you don't get with the program. Now, come here. Take a look at a couple of these. A bunch of new ones came in the mail today. Coed phys ed. Can I do this later? Jesus, Keith. I'm not trying to break your back here, pal. I know. Just want you to get off the dime and think about your future. You got a shot to be the first guy in this family who didn't have to wash his hands after a day's work. Coed phys ed. Hey. Hi. I'm looking for that song about the guy that killed himself for the girl that hated his guts. Do you know what song I'm talking about? Do you understand the concept of the word "privacy"? Yes, I do. And that's why I never let anyone in my room. Get out of here before I throw your ass out my window. - God, are you in a nice mood today. - I said get out of here. Keith, is this a side effect of being massively unliked or what? If I get a black and blue mark, you monger, you're dead! Mom! Look at it. You see what he did to me? - Get your head out of the light. - There. Sweetheart, I can't say that I see anything. I'm sure it hurts. Well, Mom, then you need some glasses. At this point, if I wanted to lie out, I could not wear a bathing suit. You know, exposing your skin to sunlight will make you old before your time. And eventually, you'll look like an albino raisin. - Thank you, Cindy. - It's my pleasure. - Stay out of his room. - Yeah. And you. You see me if you got a problem with her before you start roughing her up. What, what, what right does she have to break into my room, Dad? And I did not rough her up. She's... I have practically no feeling left in the upper part of my arm. Drop it. You know, that suggests a circulatory problem. See, I'd put more fiber into my diet and spend less time on the phone. - Shut up, please? - It's my pleasure. I wish, just once, you guys could experience the humiliation of having the weirdest guy in a huge school be a blood relative. I think your father said drop it. This whole family revolves around Keith and I'm sick of it. Laura, that is absolutely not true and you know it. Excuse me. Keith, honey, you haven't finished your dinner. You know, I don't think I've had a balanced meal here. I think I'm missing one of the important food groups. Hey, Keith! What about these colleges? I expect an answer! Did you get your eight essential vitamins today? Are you aware of how close that was? Come on, Mr. Sunshine. Skill beyond skill. Technique. Imagine what I can do when I get my driver's license back. Hey, what... Where are... Don't you have any books? No, not on me. I forgot them. You never study. You must be getting heat from the old man about college again. That's all he thinks about. Yeah, well, in comparative terms it's probably better to have an old man nagging you about your future than no old man not nagging you about nothing. Things not too great at home, huh? Hey, it don't matter, as long as you stand by me, I'm covered. Where would I be without you? Well, seeing as I drive you to school every morning you'd probably be at home asleep in bed. Do you mind? Very much so. I think it's hip you paint. - I think it's hip I drum. - Hip. It's perfect that we're friends. You know, I'm beginning to think... Pardonnez-moi. Pardonnez-moi? Pardonnez-moi. Merci. Now that's original. How long you been pulling that one? - Watts. - Wait, wait, wait. How long have you been a lesbian? Excuse me? Well, I think that you have a little bit too much up front to be a guy, so you must be a lesbian. I beg your pardon? You know, I think you got a little bit too much breastage here... - Shut up! - Okay, you fucking faggot, come on. Duncan! - That's enough! Break it up! Break it up! - Leave him alone. - That's enough! - Come on, man. - Animal. - Clear out. - Wimp. - Oh, sweetheart. See. Wait a minute, okay? They jumped me. Why don't you nail them? I didn't do anything. Those aren't mine. Oh, man, that's just for show. I don't... It's like, those were a gift from your wife. - You just got detention, mister. - For what? - For what? - Come on. - We'll talk about it in detention hall. - For what? What's this? - Isabella of Spain. - Women who rule. Are we getting feisty. What? Yo! Are you sitting down? - No. I'm walking down the hall. - Right. - Why? - I've got some bad news for you. Hey. What? What? It's unconfirmed but I got it from a reliable source. - What? - I think your father's in school. Has Keith decided on a school yet? Well, we're zeroing in on a few. Well, he indicated to me that he was interested in a couple of art schools. I don't think that's gonna happen. He comes out of art school, what's he qualified to do? I'm looking for a good business program. I think he has a good head for business. Well, the indications I've gotten are that he's more creatively inclined. Fine. But we're looking for a business school. He wants to be creative he can do that in his spare time. - How's he doing otherwise? - Fine. - Grades holding up okay? - Very well. Well, thanks for the help. Oh, well. Call me anytime you have a question. Don't hesitate. - I will. Thank you. I appreciate it. - You're welcome. Keith Nelson. Could I ask you a question about number five on Page 3? Hi, honey! Can I go to the nurse? Trust is the basis of any relationship. I trust you. Now, I want you to stay close, but not too close. You back off when I say, okay? Do both your parents work? Yeah? Maybe I'll stop by after school one day this week. Hi. Go ahead. See you later. Amanda. Hi. Want to go to your place? - What's wrong? - Do you mind? Yes, I do. I want to know what's wrong. She's a friend of my little sister. Her brother was in a pretty serious car accident and she's a little upset. I know you're coming. I'm waiting for you. Why would I be trying to make it with another girl? How can you be so beautiful and so insecure at the same time? Trust is the basis of any relationship. I trust you. And I want to give you this. I'll go get the car and I'll meet you out front. Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't. That belongs to the slumlord that owns this place. It's his pride and joy. It's pretty sick. How does it feel to stand under a real Mercedes-Benz? About the same as standing underneath a Ford. Why? You get off on it? Can I ask a question? Do you know a girl named Amanda Jones? In school? Cool. What about her? What do you think of her? - Rat bait. Why? - Just curious. What about? Her. Who she is. Because she's beautiful, right? Guys are so sickening. Really, it must be a drag to be a slave to the male sex drive. I didn't say anything about sex. You want to start a book club with her? I didn't say that I wanted to do anything with her. I just think she's interesting. Don't go mistaking paradise for a pair of long legs. What does that mean? Don't go roaming where you don't belong. It's just an opinion. I express an interest in someone that I don't even know and you're getting tense. This is not tension, this is reason. The way this girl and her big money, cruel-heart society spit on everyone, is not interesting, it's pathetic. She's not big money. Do you know where she lives? Yeah, in our sector. But she runs with the rich and the beautiful, which is guilt by association. So? This is getting stale. You calling out for food? No. You can call if you want. Don't you ever eat at home? I... I don't like to eat alone. Amanda Jones? Forget about it. It's nothing. It's not important. You couldn't score her in a million years. A: You're too shy and closed up to even approach her. And B: She'd kill you. Chicks like her have one thing on their mind, and you don't make enough of it to matter to her. Well, you can't judge a book by its cover. Yeah, but you can tell how much it's gonna cost. That's deep. You want shallow, call Amanda Jones. Speak of the she-devil. Could you fill it up? Super unleaded. Check the oil. - Can you turn off your engine, please? - My pleasure. Hey, be nice or I'll make you check the tires. So this is what you do for a living, huh? I'm sorry. My hand slipped. I... - Would you cut it out? - Why don't you mind your own business. - So, you like looking at my girlfriend? - Shut up, Hardy. - What? He likes looking at you. - Sorry. I'd recommend you keep your eyes and your mind off my property. Here's $10 for the gas and $10 for the look. Amanda Jones. Right this way, please. I'd say excusing yourself from class and leaving the school grounds with the boy with the hot car buys you two weeks of morning detention. Well, we were just talking. If all you'd wanted was talk you could've gotten that without leaving school. What are you saying, Mrs. Albright? Nothing that hasn't been said before, Miss Jones. Now, get inside. - Get inside. - It's not fair. Read my lips. Go. Welcome. Is this detention? Actually, it's your mother's house and we're all having a party. You know, you really shouldn't cut classes, Amanda, even if it's just gym class. Well, it's incredibly nice of you not to make me sit down there with those guys. I felt kind of weird, you know, being the only girl. I suppose it wouldn't matter if you served out your detention in my office. Well, I kind of had a better idea. I was kind of wondering if I wouldn't have to serve detention at all, if I promised I'd never ever do it again. We'll keep this just between you and me. You're incredibly sweet, Mr. Sauner. And I love the way you wear your hair. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, it's great. All the girls say it. - No. - Yeah. It's true. You're the best drivers' ed teacher there is. - Thank you. - Thanks very much. - Sure. Bye-bye, Amanda. - Bye. Amanda Jones doesn't know you, doesn't care about you. You're trying to jerk off the impossible. How many times do I have to listen to myself tell you this? I don't know. How many times? Do you know what kind of a guy Hardy is? Handsome, rich, muscular, popular, hot, happening and capable of reducing your head to a crimson stain on the wall. Hardy's a jerk. He screws around on her, he treats her like dirt, he has no respect for her. He's just... And obviously she gets off on it. You're losing it. And when it's lost all you are is a loser. You obviously have no idea how I feel, so, why don't you just butt out of this, please. I know how you feel. Oh, you do? Really? You've been in love before? There's a lot of things you don't know about me. Really? Who've you ever been in love with? You want to abuse yourself, be my guest. Hey, Watts, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Right? Keith, once a fool always a fool, right? Are those boys' underpants? Yeah. So? So, I've just never seen a girl wearing boys' underpants before. You ever seen a girl with a drumstick shoved up her nose? Oh, is that some kind of a threat? It's some kind of a warning. I'm petrified. Really. All right, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. I've done this before. There's Amanda. Hi. Hi. Hardy, I've had about enough of this. What? What? Look, if you were more of a person you might be enough for two girls. - But you're not. - Yeah? Well, this jealousy crap is really getting a bit tedious. Yeah, well, you won't have to deal with it anymore. - What? What does that mean? Huh? - Get out of my way. No, no, no. Not until we straighten this out. It's not gonna work anymore, Hardy. Yeah? You walk out on me, where you gonna go? Amanda! You got a minute? Hello. - Hi. - Hi. What do you want? Well, I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to go out... with me. But, if it's too difficult a time then I understand that. I'm... I just... So you're asking me out on a date? - Goodbye. - Bye. - So what did he want? - He asked me out. - What'd you say? - I said yes. She's just mad. Some juice. Why are you smiling? I wasn't aware that I was smiling, but if it bothers you then I can stop. No, it's just you haven't smiled much lately. I was curious about the change. Well, I haven't had that much to smile about, Clifford. - You have a beautiful smile, young man. - Thank you, Carol. She's Mom. I'm Dad. And you're nuts. This is not true. It can't be. This has got to be, like, the most hilarious rumor ever floated. Right? - What are you talking about? - Okay. I'm in town last night, I hear everybody talking about how Keith has asked this girl out. - No way. - Yeah. Check it out. This girl is popular, she's beautiful, and obviously in the middle of some emotional shootout to consent to date the human Tater Tot. What did you do to her, Keith? Threaten her life? I just asked her out. Her boyfriend's a man, for Christ's sake. Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's extensively easy on the eyes. He's a total buck and you're... You're Keith. Is she nice? Mother, the girl is sex. For God's sakes, I'm eating. Glad you got time to think about the girls. Between the girls and your art kick, you don't have time to think about anything important. I'll be dead and buried before you get off your butt - and apply to a college. - Ease up, Dad. Any fool could get into a college. Only a precious few may say the same about Amanda Jones. Am I wrong? Carol. Mom, what kind of milk did you say this was? Sweetheart, if you don't like the milk, drink the juice. - It's none of your business. - What, Keith? - What did you say? - Did you see the brochure, Keith...? It's what my girlfriend would look like without skin. Yeah. Nice. And while we're on the topic of the double-breasted party machine, congratulations on your latest coup. Yeah. You know about Amanda Jones? How? You think I live here? I have a personal life, too, man. How did you manage to swing that one? I don't know, Duncan. You know, I asked her out. She said yes. We're...? Anytime somebody from the outside lifts a woman from a gwat like Jenns, man, we could all find cause to rejoice. I'm proud of you. - Gwat? - A gwat, man. Punch her apron one time for me, yeah? Do you want me to kiss you or feel you up or anything? You wanna die young? What kind of question is that? Just sit here and shut up. - You don't have a boyfriend, do you? - No. See, a lot of guys I know think that you're... What? Confused. See, but I know it's just an act. - Do you know how I know? - Enlighten me. 'Cause you radiate this sexual vibe. And if you wanted to you could be a girl like that. Ray, this is 1987. Did you know that a girl can be whatever she wants to be? I know. My mom's a plumber. That explains a lot about you, Ray. And I have an enormous amount of respect for her. Just sit here and act like you like me. Okay. That'll be absolutely no problem. - Hello. - Keith, hi. What's up? Listen, are you busy now? No, we were just talking. Why? 'Cause I'd like to borrow your car, if I could. If you need... If you have something to do I could come back around and pick you up in about an hour or so. But can I borrow your car? Well, where are you going? I'd like to give Amanda a ride home. Hey, by the way, congratulations, dude. Man, she's smoking, you know. All right. Thanks. Is that okay? I'd appreciate a couple bucks for gas. Sure. Guess I'll come back in about an hour? It's just time. Not like it means anything. Thanks. - So, you gotta wait around an hour? - If I want to. Do you know how much damage we could do to each other in an hour? - It's kind of a revolting thought, actually. - Really? What's "revolting" mean? Oh, my God. Get your hands off me, man. Does that mean you want to come over? For spring break? Are you out of your mind? All right, that's it. I'm taking you to Aspen. I won't take you to Aspen. I'll take you to Chile. - Amanda. Hello. - Hi. Would you like a ride home? Well, I'm going home with Shayne. Shayne, this is Keith. Keith, Shayne. - Hello. - Hi. Well, I was just hoping we could talk. Why don't you call me? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Why don't you go with him? Okay. I'm sorry. Where's your car? Well, I'll pull around. Okay. - Thanks a lot. - What? Well, you made me look really stupid. I did not make you look really stupid. He's giving you the perfect opportunity to back out. He wants to talk. So, tell him. Tell him you're back with Hardy. I'm not back with Hardy. Okay, then fine. Tell him the truth. Tell him that you used him. - I didn't use him. - Oh, really? You didn't use him to get away from Hardy? It wasn't deliberate. I was mad and he stepped in. - It was bad circumstances, okay? - Okay. Regardless, the longer you wait to kill it, the worse it's gonna be. You saw his face. I mean, he's completely deluded. Unless, of course, you're really interested in him. Start. Please. The car won't start. Oh, no! Wait, wait, wait. Shayne! Shayne! Shayne! Oh, damn it. Look, I got to get home. I really do. - I'm sorry. - No, no, I understand. It's fine. It's fine. I'll see you later. - What? - Can I have a ride? What happened to Prince Charming? Keith! Come on. - Do you... It's okay? - Come on! - No door. - Get in. - You in? - Yup. - So where are we going? - Home. - Where's that? - D Street. It's around the corner from my house. Under the bridge from my house. Those are nice earrings. Oh, thank you. They're not mine. I borrowed them from Shayne. They're real. What? Amanda, isn't there something that you wanted to say to... - I'm sorry, what's your name again? - Keith. Oh, yeah. Keith. - Do you wanna back out of the date? - No, I... I mean, if you want out I'll understand. I wouldn't have asked you out if I didn't want to go in the first place. I don't want out. Do you? No. It's the white house up on the left. Here at the mailbox. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - You okay? - Yeah. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Thanks. Well, that was swift. I gave you a perfect window to throw him out of and you went limp. Look, maybe you can do something like that, but I can't. At least not in cold blood. Well, then I guess you got yourself a new boyfriend. Hi, guys. Did you come by to see my brother? Oh, my God. What? No. I mean, we just dropped him home. And he told you we live here? He is so modest, it kills me. I suppose he didn't mention anything about our ancestral estate in Scotland or our apartment in Paris? So modest. Hi, assface. - I just saw your girlfriend outside. - Did she say anything to you? Well, that's for me to know and for you to find out. - I'm gonna beat it out of you. - Mom! - Tell me! Tell me! - Let go! Look, how far are you going? To the nearest gas station. Wonderful. How far is that, Russia or something? - Don't worry about it. You're young. - Not anymore. Look, you better give me your phone number after this. - How you doing? - All right. - You nervous about something? - No. No. - You look nervous. You okay? - No, I'm fine. Do you always come to school this early? - No. No. Do you? - Never. - So, why today? - I wanted to talk to you. - About? - Not about art. Look, I'm totally cool with the situation. The truth is I was looking for a way out of the thing with Amanda and you saved me a tough talk. - I'm supposed to believe this, right? - It's true. I don't want Amanda hating me. I don't want anybody hating me. So, I'd appreciate it if you'd do me a favor. Now, I don't know what you have planned for Saturday but if you could, I'd like you to swing by my place. I'm having a party. Parents are in Europe. You're inviting me to your house? Yeah, I invited a lot of people. Something wrong? Gee, I... Well, I don't know. You tell me. There's nothing wrong on my end. You got an inferiority complex or something? I've known Amanda a long time and I'd like to keep it that way. If it's too much for me to ask you to bring her to a party, hey, I'm sorry I asked. Well, put yourself in my position. This doesn't sound too good. Well, put yourself in my position. I'm big enough to invite a former girlfriend and the guy who stole her from me to a party. Do you think this makes me look good? I've taken a lot of shit over this. That's why I'm a little cautious about your motives. I'll buy that. Come on. It's a party. It is not the end of the world. Are you being straight with me? Do you see any reason at this point why I should play games? Well, I'll talk to Amanda about it. But... I've already talked to her and she's fine with it. You talked to her? Really? Well, we'll drop by then. Good. You know what? It wouldn't be the weirdest thing in the world if you and I actually turned out to be friends. Yes, it would. See you. - You got a coat and tie? - No. See you Saturday. Since when do your parents let you go clubbing on school nights? I'm waiting for Amanda. Here? She's coming here? On a school night? Did I miss something? Is there a new world order? Look, if you're gonna bug me and make me feel bad, can you do it later? Please. - She said she'd meet you here? - Not in those words. In any words? - Maybe she didn't have ID. - Who doesn't have ID? Maybe she doesn't like you as much as you think. Maybe. Do you miss me, Keith? Do you miss not being around me? This isn't the third grade anymore. She doesn't love you. It's a joke. It's all a joke. How do you know? I'd bet my hands on it. - You don't want to make that bet. - Yeah, I do. I've been thinking a lot lately about you and me. And I came to a conclusion that I didn't want to deal with. But now that we talked, I can't hide it anymore. I think we'd get along much better if we didn't spend so much time together anymore. Why? Because I'm driving you crazy and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you and have you think good things about me, than have you see me and hate me. 'Cause I can't afford to have you hate me, Keith. The only things I care about in this goddamn life are me and my drums and you. Adiós. Wait, Watts. Watts! It's 10 after. Miss Albright's gonna kill us. - Hi. - Get lost, Hardy. You still mad at me? Can we talk? - No. - Please? This is cute. - I wanna talk to you. - It's too late. - I've been in agony over this. - I doubt it. What do I have to do to convince you that I love you? Start by leaving me alone. I'm late. You're going out with a lowlife just to hurt me. And you know what? It's working. It hurts. Okay? Is that why you have all your friends trying to convince me to go to your house? So you can prove what a stud you are - by beating him up? - Where did you hear that? Give me a little credit, why don't you? True, I invited him. Not to beat him up. To show you what a good loser I am. You're not a good loser. You're just a loser. Period. What is this? What is this? I am talking to Amanda. Could I please have two minutes to finish. Thank you. What is your name? Do you mind? There is nothing here that I have not seen before, okay? Amanda, can I drive you home? - What is your name? - Hardy Jenns, with two "n's." All right? All right, that's it. Get out. Go on, out! I really appreciate this, lady. Be a bitch, why don't you? Look, consider yourself reported. Now get out of here. Amanda, your reputation's hanging in the balance here. You play me around and you're gonna have a real lonely year. So I hear. Look, I am not playing. Just get out of here. Amanda, may I see you for a minute, please? I am his sister. So if you're a brother or a sister, you're in. It's like they have to accept you or else the whole social structure caves in. - Get to go to parties? - Of course. I'm probably going to the one Saturday at Hardy Jenns'. Keith's bringing Amanda, so you know, we might double. - Who'd go out with you? - The choices are limitless. Can we go, too? - Eventually, yeah, if you stay cool. - You're lying. - Oh, really? - Yeah. If you're so tight with Hardy's people, why aren't you over there with them? Because I'm here with you, twerp. Maybe you're here because you're false. - Is this a challenge or something? - Yeah. Look, I was hanging with you fungi in a vain effort to cool you out. But all I am getting is breeze, so c'est la vie. She's a liar. Her brother loathes her. He'd never let her play with his rep. Amanda has to bring him. What else can she do? Not bring him. She can't take the pressure, she'll bring him. All right. Now the party will go down as expected, okay? Amanda will blow in with her guy, and we'll nail him. Then we'll go back to business as usual. It's real simple. All right? Hey, Laura, what happened? They send you for beer? Well, I guess you just wouldn't be you if you knocked before breaking into my room. I'm sorry, Keith, I thought if I knocked, you wouldn't open up and I wanna talk to you. Well, this should be interesting. I heard something today at the mall. Hardy Jenns and his guys were there and I heard them talking about you. What's your point, Laura? Keith, it's a joke. Amanda Jones, the date, the party, the whole thing. It's a joke. She's only going out with you so she can get you to Hardy Jenns' house so he can mess you up. I heard Hardy say it, Keith. I heard him myself. It's true. You're not kidding. It's a joke? Yeah. Keith, I'm sorry... for everything. You're getting really good. Thanks. I'm working on it. Your brothers don't mind you playing this late? I don't know. I never asked. - To what do I owe this honor? - I got a little problem. You know how you told me the thing with Amanda was a joke? Yeah. Well, it is a joke. - You mean a joke as in a joke on you? - Yep. Laura heard Hardy talking about it. And Amanda's supposed to get me over to Hardy's house and they're gonna pound me. - It's a good thing you found out about it. - I'm not afraid of him. - You're gonna go through with this? - I have to. You think it's just Hardy? No, look, if he's gonna get me, he's gonna get me. It doesn't have to be at this party. He's gonna have lots of chances. - I'm not gonna hide from him. - Leave it alone. - I can't. - Why? - Because I wanna stand up to him. - Well, forget it. It's impossible. Another year, you're gone. It's better to swallow pride than blood. You don't think that. I don't believe for a second you think that. Listen, I'm not giving into them anymore. Not for another year, not for another minute. I get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was so tough on you. Me, too. You always hurt the ones you love. So, when are you beating the shit out of Amanda Jones? Amanda. Amanda! Oh, sorry. What time do you want me to pick you up Saturday? What, you have to check with your friends to see when you can go out? No, I just... It's a simple question. When? Pick me up anytime you want to. 7:30? If that's a problem, then call me. Oh, I hate Mexico. - Hi. - I'd much rather go to the Virgin Islands. I think we're going to Aspen over Christmas. I said, "Hi." Aspen's okay, but there's really nothing much to do, you know, at night. What is this, you guys? What are... Yeah, it's mostly private parties. I had a really good time there last spring. Shayne! Spring, it's a completely different feeling. - There's so many more college people. - True. But what's in the Virgin Islands? What, are you kidding me? Try a million guys. So this is it, right? I'd go anywhere if I could bag the family and be on my own. Thanks. I had my parents almost talked into letting me go to Ricky's place in Santa Fe for Thanksgiving. She's gone. - See you. - See you. How does it feel to be carrying all that cash in your pocket? - Well, it's a little uncomfortable. - Yeah. Want me to tell you one more time that I think you're crazy? Nope. Been hoarding that cash for years, right? Yep. How bad's your dad gonna ream you? We won't be able to measure with existing technology. He's a miser, right? No. It's just real important to him that I go to college. - 'Cause he didn't go. - Exactly. Hey, I just rag on you a lot about your parents and family stuff 'cause I'm jealous. It's got to feel pretty good to have someone looking out for you like he does. Sometimes. He's still gonna kill you though, right? Yeah. - Is it her body or her face? - Amanda? I don't know. It's everything. My grandmother told me when I grew up I'd have big boobs. - Yeah? What happened? - I don't know. I guess I just got lucky. Keith! Hey, got some great news today, pal. You know those T-bills at the B of A at 6-and-3/4%? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're at 7%. - That's great. - Know what that means? Means you're earning an extra $16 a year per bill. Wow! You got your first year's money, Keith. Now, all you gotta do is get off your can and pick a school to spend it on. Yeah. I gotta do that. Where did that other quarter of a percent come from? Those are them. No. - Those? - Yeah, those. Solid choice. That's the ticket. I think we've pretty much covered everything. - All the arrangements have been made. - Yep. - You know what you're gonna say? - Whatever comes in mind. - You wanna plan it out a little? - That'll sound false. I want to be true to my instincts. Don't think I'm being weird, but what if she wants you to kiss her? Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her. Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll be swept off her feet - at the touch of your amateur lips. - Thanks. - This babe has plenty of battle scars. - I think I can handle it. Great, well, I just think, maybe, you should consider whether or not you feel you can deliver a kiss that kills. What, you think I can't? - If you say you can, you probably can. - Well, no, I'm no expert. It's cool. I was just gonna work on it with you, but if you're comfortable... great. Wait, wait, wait. How do you work on it? Pretend I'm a girl, okay? I mean... Pretend I'm her. Amanda. I know it's a big stretch but try it. Come here. I didn't mean to scare you. All right, what do you do with your hands? - Well, it depends. - No, it doesn't depend. - They go on her hips. - Okay. Do it. Look into my eyes. - Come on, I don't have to do this. - I know. I'm sorry. - All right. - Just grow up a little. - She'll probably do this. - How do you know? I watch a lot of TV. Close your eyes. What? What? Lesson's over. You're cool. - You're blushing. - Yeah, right. The day I blush... No. No, no. That was very nice. You're pretty. If this is how you repay a favor, I don't know if I'm rich enough to be your friend. Oh no, wait, wait. I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry. Don't be mad, okay? I'll see you tonight! Dad. What are you doing? Get dressed. I wanna talk to you. I wanna know what's wrong. - Are you in trouble? - No. Well, were you at the bank recently? You withdrew the college money, didn't you? Yeah. Well, it's going back, pal. Every last cent of it's going back. You don't get this close to something and piss it away! It's not going back 'cause I don't have it. I spent it. What did you buy, a car? Whatever you bought, you can take back and you're gonna take it back. Dad, I can't. I don't want to. I don't care what you want. The money's going back in the bank and that's final! Look, you're not listening to me. I don't have the money. I can't get it back. Look, you had no right touching that money! I had every right! I earned it! - Where's the fucking money, Keith? - Dad, calm down. Listen to me. The money is not important here. You don't know what's important! You don't know what the hell you're talking about! I do know what the hell I'm talking about! You just never listen to me! You only hear what you want! Will you listen to me for once? I'm listening. I'm not gonna go to college. The money is gone. You can't get it back. It's over. This whole dream. It's not what I wanted. It's what you wanted! I never wanted it! I just didn't have the guts to tell you! You're only 18 years old for Christ's sake. Then I'm 19 and I'm 20! When does my life belong to me? Dad, listen. I'm going out with a girl tonight. And she is beautiful. And everybody's in love with her and she's going out with me. Get it? See, in the eyes of most people around here, I'm a nothing. And, so I don't start agreeing with them, I'm gonna go through with this date. I wanna show this girl that I'm as good as anybody else. So, what, are you gonna impress her with money? Think that's the solution, Keith? Dad, didn't you ever have guys at your school that didn't fit in? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah? Well, I'm one of those guys. I thought things were going okay for you. Yeah. Well, I like art. I work in a gas station. My best friend is a tomboy. These things don't fly too well in the American high school. I didn't know about this. Well, how could you know about it? You're my father. Jesus, Keith, how could you blow all that money? Believe me, there's a good reason behind all this. You just got to trust me. - Trust you? There's a limit, Keith. - How can you put a limit on trust? Do you know any father who would let his kid do something like this? No. So why should I have to go along with it? Because you believe in me. Listen, I'm gonna replace the money. Think about it, you know I will. I'm not stupid. I didn't work all this time just to throw everything away without thinking about it. I know what I'm doing. You sure? Yeah. Okay. But I'm still gonna ride your ass about college, Keith, - I'm not giving up on that. - All right. I've said my piece. - Do me a favor, will you? - Sure. Stop calling me Clifford. No problem. Hi. Stop sneaking around listening at people's doors. - Me? - Yeah, you. Dad, I just came up to tell Keith that Watts is downstairs waiting for him. Well, don't get in his way. - Did he go apeshit? - No. - Really? - Laura, I'm really in kind of hurry now. Keith, I just came up to wish you luck tonight. Okay, I have all my friends crossing their fingers for you. Thank you. He really didn't go apeshit? He's probably saving it for me. - You want me to lock up for you? - Please. Thanks. Give me a break. - Would you look at us. - I think you look tremendous. It's too bad my grandmother bit the dust. She'd be very proud. I'm wearing a bra. Go get your skag, and let's roll. Mom, it's for me. - What time will you be home? - Early. Tell Hardy hello for us. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - You look different. - Than what? - Than before. - I'm wearing a suit. - So... - Are you ready? Yeah, I'm standing in an open door. I guess you could say that. - Let's go. - All right. - Wow! Check that out. Did you steal it? - No. I borrowed it. See, I figured your ass was too precious for vinyl. You're right. Thank you. So do you always bring an extra girl when you go out? Well, I like to cover my bets. That's very cute. I'll have to remember that. I'm gonna love this one. I can feel it already. Is it moving? Well, what is it? It's beluga caviar. It's the most expensive caviar you can buy. I thought you were an uptown girl. You should know this stuff. Look, how this happened is as much of a mystery to me as it is to you. I'm not any more thrilled about it than you are, so why don't you just stop giving me attitude, please? - I'm giving you attitude? - Yeah. Like on Friday, pulling that he-man power play about how I have to ask my friends for permission. I didn't appreciate it. - I don't like being treated like that. - Well, it's true, isn't it? - At least I have friends. - Are you sure? Look, do you wanna end this right now? Oh, no. Hey, hey, relax. Calm down. Please. Listen, we ordered. I don't want to end it. Enjoy the atmosphere. Pretend I'm dead. I wish. Throw it out! Throw it out! Ladies coming out. All right! The point is 10. All right, one-time bet. One-time bet only. - I'll give you 5-to-1 on it. - 5-to-1? - 7-to-1. - The 7-to-1? - Does it look like the Sahara? - Do we look Italian? Look at my face. I don't need this. I got action... - Where you going? - Sit, sit. Conference. Conference. What do you say? - No way. To win big you got to do what? - Lose. - Lose big. Lose big. - That's right. What are we doing now? - We're losing big. - Double nickels. Ten the hard way. Mess with the bull, you get the horns. You know what I'm saying? Bon appétit. Very uptown. Hey, you're smiling. I'm sorry. No, no. Don't apologize. It's nice. You have a lovely smile. - You should smile more often. - Okay. Whenever I try not to smile, I smile more. - I'll get the door. - No, I got it. Sorry I wasn't more on the ball. I was comatose. Here, I brought you something to eat. - A gift? For me? - Yeah. - Yeah, I thought you might be hungry. - Gee, thanks. Eating and driving is as handy as skiing and doing your taxes. Well, maybe you can eat at the next stop. Could I book time to take a leak? - What's your problem? - Nothing. Excuse me a minute, please. Listen, you volunteered to do this. I was all prepared to drive and you said, "No, no, I'll drive so you guys can talk." Remember? It was this morning, moron, of course I remember. So why are you giving me shit? Let's go. If my dinner reeks, let me know, I'll put it in the trunk. It's fine, really. Well then, we're off. - Pardon me. - No problem. Good. Thank you. Break his heart, I break your face. - What are we doing here? - It's an art museum. But what are we doing here? - You don't like art? - I do like art. It's just that, isn't it closed? That doesn't mean we can't go in. Okay. Hello. We've been waiting for you a long, long time, my pop and I. Come on in. Right this way. - Gimme five over here, pal. - There you go. - Amanda, Duncan. - Nice to meet you, Amanda. And Ice. - No monkey business, hey? - Dad, please, freeze it. Okay? I told you before, it's gonna be all fine. God, those are nice legs, man. If I lose my job because of this you're in the dumper, Duncan. Absolutely, Pop, absolutely. Thanks a lot. Just remember, anything for a pal, okay? - Have you ever been here before? - Yeah. Sixth grade. I don't remember. I come here all the time. I've never been here at night, though. This place is my church. I can come here and what anybody says about me doesn't matter. I have to come back here when I can spend more time. We have all night. There's one in here that I'd like to show you. So what do you see in me? Be honest. What do you see in me? You first. I don't think anybody ever thought anything about me other than I look good next to him. And I went along with it because I'd rather be next to somebody for the wrong reasons than alone for the right ones. I'd rather be right. Can't stand being alone. Nobody can stand being alone. The minute you stop thinking there's someone out there for you it's over, isn't it? - Isn't it? - I don't know. Listen, I've been waiting a long time, and I still don't have it, but I will. What? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. No, I don't. Yes, you do. It's not funny. I know you know what I'm talking about. - I don't. - This. Tonight was a joke. I was set up. You used me, right? - You think I used you? - Didn't you? - I don't know. In a way. - In a way? Amanda, there's only one way you use someone. You either do or you don't. And you didn't use me? God, you hypocrite. What's hanging in that museum, huh? My soul? No, it's my face. You're using me to pay back every guy with more money and more power than you. Paint it any color you want. It's still you using me. You're right. I did use you. For all those reasons. I'm sorry. Can we call it even? We're even. - This is for you. - What is it? It's my future. In this box is my future, every cent I've ever earned. It's for you. - I can't take these. - You have to. I know you liked them. I saw you wearing Shayne's, remember? This is insane. It doesn't make any sense. You shouldn't have to borrow anything. You're too good for that. Why are you crying? I feel so terrible for what I've been doing. I hate feeling ashamed. I hate where I'm from. I hate watching my friends get everything their hearts desire. I gave in to that hatred and I turned on what I believed in. I didn't have to. You didn't. So you won't do it again. You don't have to. Ever. - What now? - Hardy's house. Have you forgotten something? He wants to beat the crap out of you. - It's for real, Keith. - I know. Well, if you wanna do that, drive yourself. I have to face him sooner or later. - It's not just Hardy. It's his friends. - I can handle it. I could beat the crap out of you. You won't last six seconds. - I know what I'm doing. - Don't go overboard, studly. Let's go. You don't have to do this, you know. Yeah, I do. Okay. I'll be here. Thanks. Guess what? Amanda brought him. Welcome. I'm glad you could come by. It's getting late, I was worried you were gonna disappoint us. - So did you have a good time? - Yeah. Yeah. She's deceptively innocent, isn't she? Clean and nice on the outside. Did she do you? See, the one thing that I'm glad about is that you get her used. Back off, man! Come on, Keith! That was not very smart, friend. I don't even care about you. She's the trash. You're just a fool. Take him outside and kick the shit out of him. - Why don't you take me outside? - What? - I said, why don't you take me outside? - I don't play that way. I would love to, but you see, I am the host here. I have guests. I said, take him outside, okay? - Hardy, you don't wanna do this. - Oh, really? Yeah, you said yourself, I'm the trash. I got him into this. Why don't you just deal with me, huh? That's very touching, standing up for your new man. I like that. Look, let him go. Why don't you do something right for once in your life? Amanda, forget it. It's worthless. You can't talk to him. - What do you want? - You know what I want. Okay. You want me back, I'm back. Come on. It's not that easy. You're gonna have to convince me. I want you to beg. Let him go. Come on, you're a beggar. Beg. Bastard. You're gonna have to beg. I don't think that's gonna be necessary. You know, I didn't know Jenns lived in a henhouse. Did you know that? Must be a henhouse. 'Cause I don't see nothing but chicken shit. I don't want any trouble with you, all right? My parents are gonna be home in a little while. You leave now and we'll forget everything. All right, now. Let's just cut the bullshit, all right? Please? I'm here to wipe the floor with your ass, and you know it. And everybody knows it. And you deserve it. And I think it's safe to say that this party is about to become a historical fact. Wait, wait. Duncan, - let me talk to him. - Okay. Look, I'm perfectly willing to forget this. Okay? I see no reason in carrying this on any longer. It was a joke. It's gone too far. It's over, okay? You want the truth? You want the plain truth? You're over. Are you just gonna leave? There isn't anything I can do to him he hasn't already done to himself. Come on. Wish I could live with that. Good move, Amanda. I approve. - Thanks again, Duncan. - No problem, no problem. You guys go along, okay? We're just gonna stick around here, try to crank up this party to a nice, respectable level. - Okay? - Okay. Don't worry. I'm not gonna mess him up. I'm not even gonna touch him. I'm just gonna make him cry just a little bit by just looking at him. Okay. Good night. All right. Let's cut the bullshit. We're gonna have some fun. We're gonna have some fun! All right, guys, these girls have been looking at you like I don't know what. All right, now we're ready to party. What a beautiful woman right here. She is dying for you. Remind me never to get you mad at me. Did you see the look on his face? Nice move. I saw it from out here. Well, why don't you guys run along? I'm gonna walk. My butt's asleep from sitting all night. I'm sorry if I misjudged you. That's okay. Keys are in the car. Remember how I said I'd rather be with someone for the wrong reasons than alone for the right ones? I'd rather be right. It's gonna feel good to stand on my own. Here. In your heart you wanted to give these to somebody else. Go. Go on. Watts! Watts! Watts. Watts. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Yeah, well, you're stupid. I always knew you were stupid. Why didn't you tell me? You never asked. I wanted these. I really wanted them. They're yours. - You knew you were gonna get these. - No, I didn't. I hoped, but I didn't know. You knew. I had a feeling. Well, how do they look? You look good wearing my future.
