Around 100 years back... To be precise, it was in July, 1924... when the worst deluge happened in Kerala. Since it was the year "1999" in the Malayalam calendar, elders refer to it as the '99 floods. I only remember what my father told me about it. Dad told me that the entire state was submerged back then. If a hill station like Munnar were flooded, just imagine the magnitude of the water levels! During those floods... There was a hill called Karinthiri Hill... According to my dad, the whole hill was washed away. And... back then.... there was a train service in Munnar. Even that was ruined during those floods. The railway system in Munnar, known as Kundala Valley Railway, was the first monorail system in India. The disaster resulted in the loss of many human lives, as well as numerous animals, plants, and people's possessions. Kerala also lost this railway system during this catastrophe. Kerala received unprecedented rains, which was 64% higher than normal, during that monsoon season. Kerala received 3,368 mm of rain... during that period, according to historical records. Two different reasons have been cited for causing the floods. One, the Periyar river was in spate and the water flooded the mainlands. And the second reason was that the Mullaperiyar dam had a leak. And this debate has been ongoing for several years. My dear Suresh, don't utter such foolishness on TV. Have you read the report that Gadgil submitted, for the preservation of Western Ghats? I have read it! The more we harm nature, the more frequent and severe natural disasters will become. Each calamity that has occurred over the years have had specific natural causes. My dear friend, those are tales of the past. Did we have so many facilities then? Today, we have a very efficient infrastructure in Kerala. And we have capable officers who are aware of what has to be done. But, all that won't be necessary. Such a disaster, I mean, a flood... Such a disaster is not going to happen in Kerala again! I am 100% sure! July 21, 2018 Aruvikkulam Are you busy, Sir? What is it, Chechi? Sir, Anoop is here. He has been waiting for a long time. Don't take advantage of me, just because I call you 'Chechi'! I've already told that fool so many times... He is a naive fellow, Sir. He is my friend's son. At least for the sake of her peace of mind... Giving peace of mind to the public... is a part of maintaining law and order, right? One minute, Sir. Please don't get angry, Sir. I'm really stressed. That's why! How many times have I told you... that there's no connection between the Police and the military? If there's any such verification, they have their own procedures and methods. My work Visa is almost ready, Sir. Aargh! So, if that verification comes up in between... You can call the DGP or IG and do something, can't you? Oh! As if they don't have any other work! Why did you join the army if you're such a coward? And then, you made a fake medical certificate and came here... to trouble us! Get going! We are loaded with work here! You just have to make a phone call, Sir! If you come here one more time for this, I will put you behind bars. You'll need an original medical certificate then! This applies to you as well, Chechi! Get lost! - Bugger! - Shall we go? Don't worry. Come with me. That girl I told you about? Her family called this morning. Shall we visit them this Sunday? My dear Chechi, being single is not my issue. How many times have I been humiliated now! I'm done with it! Isn't the Government paying you a salary, Chechi? Then why are you doing this broker's job? Bloody rascal! Are you messing with the police? Get lost! Hey, Anoop! You will prosper only when you sever all ties with him! That's right. Him and his egg-shaped helmet! Come, hop on. - Shall we go? - Yes. Hey, in case an outsider comes here for the verification, won't we know about it? Or else, they will need to disguise themselves. Hey Alex! How can you shut your shop and roam around like this? You will prosper only when you sever all ties with him! It's correct now! Of course, he's just the right person to advise. What's your problem? Go back inside! Go on, go on! You're the manager of the blind man's super market, right? Go on! Isn't it such an esteemed job? [old Malayalam song playing] Chetta! One lemon soda! I have a worker here. He hasn't come today. So, I can't give you a lemon soda. Worker? I help you because you are a poor, blind man! And now you're also mocking me! I'm just waiting for my Visa. I will fly to Dubai. You can make the lemon soda all alone then! The sky is really clouded today. The kids are cheerfully arriving at school with multicolored umbrellas. Your neighbour, Cleetus, the fox, is dropping his kids at the school. Well, our "Rocket" bus arrived at its usual breakneck speed... and has already departed. Simon is impatiently waiting to ring the school bell, like a hen about to lay an egg. Malathy teacher is arriving on her scooter, as if she is landing an airplane! I wonder why doesn't she apply brakes? Every time she halts the scooter using her feet. Our Roly-Poly and gang, wonder where they are? My father will be here for Onam holidays. Well, here they are! Anoop! Come here. - Hey! - Yes. Call Rameshan and ask him to arrange your Visa quickly. You're capable of much more than this street-shop commentary. - I'll try sending him a voice note. - Yes, do it. Rameshetta, I know I'm disturbing you. But I should think about myself, right? Don't forget about my Visa! - I've sent it. - Okay. But there's no blue tick yet. - It will come. - Okay. Rameshetta, I know I'm disturbing you. But I should think about myself, right? Don't forget about my Visa! - Hello. - Hello. Give it to me. Oh! So, you'll answer only if I call from her number? I was busy at work, Dad. I didn't see your call. Yeah, right! Anyway, we can't delay this any further. Since she made it clear that, she cannot continue in this marriage, the lawyer needs you to sign the papers. Well, you already fooled me once saying that you'll come for Vishu. It's not like that. I've applied for leave this time. It will be approved for sure. Can you please pass the phone to Anu? She isn't interested in talking to you. We'll talk once you get here. Let me see. Things will be turn chaotic here if I also take a leave. I'll call you later. Your wife's due date is next month, right? Yes. You can use my leave to visit your home. I don't have anything urgent to do there right now. Call your wife and tell her. Thank you! - Hello. - Hello. Aunty... I'll put him on, Aunty. It's a call from your Mom, bro. Shucks! Haven't I told you not to call me often? Why are you calling me now? - It's nothing. - Is anyone on their death bed? No, right? Hang up! I will come there. Your daughter asked for a notebook... - Hold this. - I will move it, Chechi. Hey, who are these people? They've parked the vehicle in the middle of the road. They couldn't find any other place here! Stupid people! They could only park in the middle of the road! It's a car registered in Kerala. Smash it! Let's see what they will do! Hey! Hey, what's your problem? Are you blind? Look what you have done! If you park in the middle of the road, your car will be damaged. Don't talk too much! This is not Kerala! This is my place! I'll drive as I please! Go, file a complaint if you have a problem. Is there no place left in your State... that you've come here to create a scene? Get lost, you wretch! You said it, bro! Oh, look! It's so cool! Oh no, my Dad has arrived! I'm leaving! The load will reach today. Make the pending payments. Quite a lot of it is pending, right? Yes, Annachi. Yes. - Boss. - Hey, - Do you need money? - No, boss. Here. Shall I leave? Go on. Can I take that water bottle? Go and take it. - Okay, boss. - Okay. Why are you acting like you're studying? Don't I know that you were playing till now? Lazy bum! If you don't study well, you will rot here! That will be your fate! Why are you scolding her? You come here only once in a while. You can speak to her affectionately, right? She is a motherless child! Take this. Brother! That Malayali girl has come to our village! First News Exclusive... 'The other side of Mullaperiyar' We, as Malayalis, are alarmed of the Mullapperiyar dam becoming full. But for the people of Lakshmipuram village to get water, the dam has to be at full capacity. There she is! There's water shortage in our village, right? They are TV reporters from Kerala who came to cover it. These villagers, who are facing dire water shortage, are praying for the dam to be filled completely. Hey, come! You should not let them off the hook. Say something, bro. From where are you getting water now? Earlier, we used to have clean water here. Now, we have to go quite far. There is a well over there. Even the water over there has reduced now. Earlier, we used to have clean water here. Outsiders arrived and concealed the rivers, erected structures on top of them. And now we're struggling because of the water shortage. Yes! They have to travel long distances just to get a single drop of water. Rain on! Ready? Jump! Shucks! Let's try again. Who's that guy? His timing is really off! Hey! Jump properly! Don't jump as you please! Go and tell him. We're losing light. Useless fellow! Don't make them curse me! Do it properly! - Sir... sorry! - Okay... ready! Rain on! Jump! I won't act in any ad you're assisting on, anymore. I lose my timing when I see you! Oh! It was me who got the timing wrong! I should have said yes when that loser director proposed to me. Had I done that, I would've been a costume designer by now. Yeah, right! There are 100 girls in Kochi who have completed fashion designing courses. If it was so easy, they could just marry some directors, right? You can learn only if you assist someone. In that case, there are 200 handsome models in Ernakulam. I can marry one of them, right? Oh! Is it? Go on, then! Go now itself! I have other things to do. Stop kidding! When are you coming home with your father and brother? I've convinced my mother after a lot of effort. Can't we just do a register marriage? Why do you want our families to meet? It's such a bore! You won't get it. I want everyone in my life. Just come home, please! Look! Do you see that? A single flex of mine over there. After seeing that, your dad should get impressed and call me! That was my plan. Well, your dad is not fortunate enough! Papa is leaving right now. I will reach there before sunrise. If I don't see gummy bears when I wake up tomorrow morning.... Papa! I won't forget. - Do you want anything else? - I want an Elsa doll. - I want Diary Milk and... - Haven't you left yet, Sir? You'll be late if you keep listening to her list! Better start now. Okay, okay. [news report from television] The search for the fishermen who have found... missing from the coast of Thanki, Kollam continues. - Hello. - Hello. Is this Shaji? Yes, Sir. Haven't you taken any action regarding the missing fishermen? We informed the Coast-Guard day before yesterday, Sir. What are these TV reporters saying then? They are the ones whom we should fear. They can say whatever they want, can't they? We should be scared of them! Call the Coast-Guard and follow up, at the earliest. I will follow up, Sir. - And call me back. - Okay. Angel, how bad is the situation out there? How do the fishermen community respond to this? Yes, Reji. The fishermen are considering this as a lapse from the government's side. So, some fishermen have gone out to sea to search on their own. It has been three days since my husband went out to sea. There has been no information about him so far. Everyone is saying that they will return. But it's been so many days, right? We have prayed to all the Gods! Just knowing that they're alive would give us some peace. Yes, Reji. They are really anxious. It seems like their hopes have diminished. Anyway, let's hope that they will return. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Why are you crying like this? Situations like these are bound to arise while sailing at sea. We will survive if we're meant to! Or else, we will die! What is the point of crying like this? Hey! Hey, stop it! Don't cry like a girl! Are you all still crying? Enough. Stop it. Will they return if we cry? Hey, did you eat anything? Come, let's eat. Come, Raziya. Let's eat. Winston and Dad have gone to sea, right? You know them, right? When they return, Ronson, Shiyas Ikka and Bastin Chettan... will be there with them. Eat now. Come. Shiyas Ikka! Come, come! Hey! Hey, get up! Get up! Winston! Look over there! Oh no! Go! Go away! Oh no! Go away! - Dad! - Yes! Careful, son! Don't just stand there! Pull him on to the boat! Hurry up, Winston! Start the boat, Dad! [Periyar river conservation protest] - Yes, Sathishetta. - Hello. - Hello? Just a minute. Hey! Keep a couple of dad's shirts and pants ready. - And his phone charger too. - Okay. Get ready quickly. I'm already late. I heard everything, Sathishetta. Now that there's a court order, Police will create trouble if you don't remove the protest stalls. We were sitting here for so long. What about that? What should I do about it? Please hold, Sathishetta. Yes, Dad. I had warned you! The TV channels will air our news to get TRP. When they find other news, they go after those. What I suggested is the best way forward now. There are brave guys here who are ready for a fight! What's the point in sitting here for a non-violent protest? I will arrange guys who can make bombs. You just have to stand by me. Are you coming? You never do as you are told! You come walking! - I'm leaving. - I will come along with Amal. Just get going, Sis'. Yes! The current water level of the dam is 98.80 feet. I didn't see you yesterday. Did you leave early? Well, work has been really hectic for the past two days. I couldn't come here. Your channel office is not so far from here, right? She is the channel chief now, right? She is busy because of that. And it's been raining so heavily for the past 2-3 days! I'll just head home and come back, dear. I'll be stuck here if I keep waiting for your brother! It's been 2 days, right? I will change and come back quickly. Dad, I have to leave now! I've brought your clothes. They're going to open the shutters of the Idukki dam today. I have to go there at the earliest and start reporting. Reporters from other channels would've reached there by now. I can't delegate it to anyone since it's an exclusive news. It's a highly competitive field, right? - You carry on, dear. - Okay. - Go on. - I'll come when I'm free, Mom. Okay, dear. The shutters of Idukki dam are being opened today, after 26 years. The entire state of Kerala is waiting for this event. As per the information we've received, the first shutter will be opened at around 11 a.m. The second and third shutters will be opened immediately after that. District authorities have informed that all necessary precautions have been taken. Before the dam is opened, the police evacuated people from areas where the water level would rise quickly. A huge crowd has assembled here to witness this event. The first shutter of Idukki Dam will open any moment from now. Have some more before you go. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. - Here you go! - Thank you! - For you, dear! - Thank you! And this is for you! Don't tell this to anyone. Okay? A packet of Eclairs, please. - How much? - Actually, it's Rs. 200. There is a discount of Rs. 20. You can pay Rs. 180. Okay. - Here you go. - Okay. Who was it, Anoop? I don't know. I haven't seen her here earlier. Anyway, she is beautiful. What if she has come from Delhi, looking for you? No way! Hey! Sir is coming! Silence! This is your new teacher. Manju Teacher. Starting today, this teacher will be teaching you Maths. Understood? Wishing you an auspicious start, Teacher. - Oh no! - Oh no! So auspicious! Hey! What is this? Silence! Don't mind it, Teacher. We've been asking them to change the tiles for a while now. I know the right guy for it! I'll be right back. Okay. Yeah, come quickly. So, your military training finally came in handy! Don't mock me when I've come here to do a favor! There should be someone to mock you, right? Roly-Poly! It's over there. Uncle Anoop calls me Roly-Poly. I'll keep this on top of that desk. Is your home nearby? Yes. Where were you earlier, Teacher? I was in Delhi. Which school over there? Not in a school. I was in a different profession. I came back here because of my Mom's ailment. What are you doing there? It's here! - Who is at your home? - Husband and children. Hey!! Why are you late, Popeye? This is why Popeye got late! Is your dad inside? Dad has gone outside with grandpa. - Is it? - Yes. Come. Wow! Pink perch fish! Can't you differentiate between Mackerel and Pink perch? I feel ashamed to even say that you belong to coastal community. Yes, the same goes for me too! I feel ashamed to say so. That's why I tell everyone that I'm a model! Model? Great! Identifying a fish is not a big deal! It should be tasty. That's all, right dear? But you don't like the smell of fish, right? Oh! Here comes the loser! Okay then. What's up? I haven't seen you in a couple of days. Are you fine, son? Hey, Dad! Don't pull my leg! Didn't I tell you that I had an ad shoot? What ad is it? It must be an ad for undergarments. What a fresh joke! Just like the fish you catch! - Laugh, dear! - Don't speak badly about my job! - What? - Hey! Stop it. Tina! Dear! ["Popeye" playing on TV] How many times have I told you not to watch TV while eating? Kiren Rijju, the Union Deputy Minister, said that... the central team will soon reach Kerala to assess the damage caused by the rains. Though MPs from Kerala requested that... more central fund should be announced and that the criteria should be relaxed, Don't go and make food now. Here, have some fish curry. - Thanks! - You can bring the bowl tomorrow. Okay, dear. Dad. You should accompany me to a place. To Chandy's house in Aruvikkulam, right? - Huh? - I know! Shall I get you some more rice, Dad? No, dear. Oh, that's how! What's in Aruvikkulam? Long back, you took me to Kothamangalam to meet her, right? - Oh! - Same thing! Why did he take you to Kothamangalam, Grandpa? Well, dear... Boys often develop a worm infection when they reach a certain age. Then, they take their dads to meet some people. It's just for a formality. Isn't it, dear? Where is that place? You watch your cartoon! That's better. What does he do? I manage a light and sound business. Lighting up the church during festivals... That's what he does. What he does is not important. What does he do? I'm into modelling. What do you do for a living? That's what I meant. We have a boat. We'll be buying another one soon. A house-boat? Well... No, it's a sturdy fishing boat that goes to sea. House-boats are tethered and remain afloat on the water, right? This one really takes off! It can get you a lot of fish as well. It's true that my daughter is old enough to be married. We've been receiving some good proposals too. When she told her mother that she likes someone, I also thought that I'll consider it. Don't be upset when I say this. Though you say that you own a boat and that you're into fishing, you're just catching fish, at the end of the day. Right? I can let that slide. But my relatives might not see it that way, right? And in my limited knowledge, when the sea level rises, people who live near the coast... may have to stay in relief camps full-time. So, my daughter... will be living in a relief camp in a school of college, for three or four months, every year. She has grown up in a house that has all these amenities. How can I send her to a relief camp? Let me be frank. I won't give my daughter away to your family. Dad! Let me tell you, dear. Did I say anything bad about the boy you like? Let him find a place to stay, that he can call his own. We'll think about the rest, later. So, you understood what I meant, right? Come, son. [Congrats to Meera Aravind, from Malarvadi Arts and Sports Club, Aruvikkulam] - Ashwin. - What? Oh, it's the soldier! [singing a song from the movie 'Border'] - Hello. Yes, Chetta. Hey! Can you go to the work site? The carpenter stopped working saying that he ran out of materials. - Go there and check it. - Shucks! These guys are the limit! I was there yesterday. Don't get stressed, Chetta. I'll go there after some time. Call me when you reach there. Those guys can't be trusted! Well, Chetta... Please let me know if there's some good job for me in Alappuzha. I'm sick of this place, Chetta. Hey, you have a good job at your own home, right? Your dad is delaying the paint job because he can't find any workers. Can't you join your dad at work? You will get an earful from me, Shajiyetta! You hang up, Chetta. That's better! Okay, okay. Where were you? I've been calling you for so long. A family came with a marriage proposal for my sister. Dad made a mess of it! Sometimes, dad can be very rude! I was... Get down, get down. Get down quickly. Move forward. Move forward, Chetta! Get in. Okay, let's go! - Don't look there! - What? - Don't look! - Why? - Don't look! - What is it? Someone has actually come in a disguise just like you predicted! - What? - Yes! Dinner is ready, Dad. Come, let's eat. Come, Bastin Chetta. I don't want dinner, dear. My stomach feels gassy. Is it? Someone else is also feeling gassy. Another one is having a headache. Is this a hospital? Why are you all sitting like this? Is it because of what that girl's dad said? Do you know this, Bastin Chetta? Before I got married and came to this house, my dad never allowed me even to go to the movies alone! He'd say that it's a high range area. I won't get buses and what not. But my dad doesn't know... how much freedom, peace of mind, and security I've gained... since I got married and moved into this house. I never had it while living there for 20 years. After my husband and his dad head out to the sea, if any kind of sound is heard from this house, or if I raise my voice at my daughter, Shanthi Chechi will immediately come and ask, "What is it, Tina dear?" Do you know that no one locks this house when they step out during the day? That's not because there is nothing valuable here. It's due to the trust that nobody will steal anything from here. And about staying in camps during the rains... He won't understand it even if we tell him. Only those who have experienced it will understand! Moreover, what's the problem in staying in camps? Where else can you see so many people... gathering together in camps during the heavy rains, cooking food, singing, and dancing? It's so amazing! If we are in need of help, a hundred people will come rushing to help us! Let something happen to him! We'll see who's going to help him! It's true that we are fisherfolk. We don't have much money. At times, we may have a stench too! But there's no lack of humanity here! It's quite abundant, to be frank. Hey, Nixon! My daughter is starving because you haven't had your dinner. You better come and eat now! Headache and gas, it seems! And yeah! If that girl loves you, we will bring her here, no matter where she is from! Move aside! They think they are a fasting committee! Hey Winston, get the bottle that Lonappan brought. It's the best remedy for headache and gas! Yes!

[news report from television] Idukki has opened its first shutter after 26 years... crowd has gathered in numbers to witness this phenomenal sight. I never switch it off. It's so nice to see the water flowing down, right? Look. Actually, we all are lucky. That's why we could witness these events. You have crops, right? Won't the crops get destroyed if the water flows like this? Yeah, I have crops. It won't flood the farmland. It's quite far away, right? Have you come here to fix their wedding... or to do farming? We were just... Well, we needn't think any further. Let the rains subside. Let September come. We will choose a suitable date and arrange the wedding. - We will do that. - So, all of you should have this. We didn't make this here. We bought it from Saji's bakery. Mom... I've told you a hundred times... not to do any physical tasks at home. We can arrange other people to do it. I've called Fayaskka and asked him to arrange a house-maid. Why, son? Is there any issue between her and you? There's nothing, Mom! Then why isn't she coming here? It's been so long since she left. When I call her, she keeps giving different excuses. Mom, I have some urgent work to do. I'll call you at night, okay? Hello, dear. Hello, Mom? Tell me, dear. What's the issue between the two of you? Don't get me anxious during this old age. Didn't Rameshettan tell you anything? [broken voice] He's always busy. Hello? Hello, dear? Can't you hear me? Hello? I've lost the signal. Let me just step out. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me now? Hello, Mom? Can you hear me now? Shucks! Mom? Mom? Chetta, I've found someone. He will come. Yes. Hey, come here. You don't have to worry at all. We have our people there. There won't be any kind of checking. Boss, why don't you tell me what the load is? Hey, it's just a small matter. Those Malayalis want to blow up a factory using bombs. Here you go. Here's the advance. Hey! Why are you reconsidering it? You don't like them, right? Take it. Sethupathi, the load has to go there tonight. Okay, sir. What is it? Any problem? It's nothing. Just hold this. I'll come back only after 2-3 days. Don't keep calling me unnecessarily. I will call you, okay? Okay. It's a budget-friendly wedding. I'll call you later. - Chetta! - Yes! Raviyetta, I'm getting married. You must come with your family. - You must reach on the previous day itself. - This doesn't have a proper appeal. - Of course. - I'll manage with whatever appeal it has. You must come. Don't forget. It's my wedding! - Your mom had invited me. - Is it? So, you must come! Oh, thank you. Only the two of you came? - They will come in October. - You could have brought them too. Anyway, please go have food. Josootty Chetta, it's my wedding. - Bring your family too. - Sure. Shajiyetta, "Fox" Cleetus hasn't come? Why do you have to know that? Dude, it's your own wedding. Can't you invite people properly for that? Why do you have to be so stingy? Didn't you build this house by being stingy too? Even if that's the case, the house is great. Well, the construction happened under my supervision. By the way, has Arun taken his leave yet? Leave has been sanctioned. But he'll run out of money soon. - That's the kind of list she has given. - Huh? What did you ask him to bring for me? Not just for you, Uncle. I've ordered a bicycle for Aby Chettan as well. Oh, yeah! Where is Roly-Poly? He's crazy about bicycles. These big bicycles aren't like the ones kids can drag around. That too, with those boxes and what not? He managed to do this when I wasn't paying attention. So, yeah. He needn't go to school for a few days now. He is resting. Is it a serious fracture? Oh! It's not that bad. Hearing your voice, he stopped this midway, Anoop. Go on! He is calling you. Hey Roly-Poly! Roly-Poly! I'm getting married! I haven't hired anyone else to serve salt for the wedding feast. You must do it. You need to recover and get back in form before that. Got it? Yeah, yeah! He won't stay still even for a second. Is that so? I have a solution for that. Currently Kerala is facing such heavy downpour... after the flood of '99. Shouldn't you colour the tree green? This is a burnt tree. Don't you have anything to study? Hey! Popeye is here! Where is it? Give it to me! Chechi! Chechi! Didn't go for work today? Chechi! - What fish is on the menu today? - No fish today. There's some gravy of yesterday's sardine curry. Shall I get that? Yuck! Do you mind having chicken for two days? Here you go! 2 kilos of chicken! Where did you get this from? Fishing in the sea is not the only job that demands hard work. Modelling is also an art that can provide income. See this! 25,000 Rupees! What is it for? To buy a boat? Sheesh! To buy a boat? There's a photographer called Kumara Pai in Ernakulam. The portfolios he clicks are truly exceptional. He's going to click photos of your Popeye. And this is the money I need to pay him for that. - Hello? - Where the hell are you? Our house has been flooded with water. Flood in Kuttannad is a usual affair. Call me if there's anything new. Listen, I can't move this TV on my own. Where are you? Can you please come? Call Jobin! He comes there to watch TV daily, right? Let him move it. I'll be coming back only after a few days. I've been hired by a foreign couple to take them around Kerala. I requested for this trip. Yeah, now we've reached. We are lucky, you know! Where's the guy? Hey! You hang up! They are here. You call Jobin and do something. Sir! Sir! Hey! Poland! Wow! Chetta! Great! We are lucky to see you! - Hi! - It's alright. Hello, guys! We've just reached Kerala. Amazing rain! Beautiful people! What is your name? Koshy. Jacob Koshy. Oh! Koshy? Nice name! Koshy, our great friend! Facebook Live? This is called Vlogging. He's a famous vlogger from Poland. Sir, we can't park the car here for too long. Okay, guys! Wait and stay tuned! Demolish the airport walls! Protect the lives and assets of the public! Koshy, why are these people standing here? Madam... That people... enemy of... rain climate. They're raising slogans to demolish the airport wall. Water is entering their houses. They hate water coming to their home.. but they like water coming to the airport. Bloody fools! No airport, no tourism! Then how money? Koshy, what is our plan? Yes, sir. First, we go to Cherai beach. Then, Fort Kochi. Very good place. Lot of good folks! Then, Kumarakom. Roasted Pearl Spot Fish! Then, Kuttanad! Kuttanad is my place! Where I... We... We see the boat race together. Oh, great! I like Pearl Spot Fish!

Where are you going, Sir? The sea is in total turmoil. Locals are agitated for not erecting seawall.

[arguments continue] Hey! I'm telling you because you've been asking repeatedly. They're planning to plant bombs at a large factory in Kerala. This load is meant for that. To avoid being checked, put up a sign that says 'Rice & Pulses' and keep moving. Bro, where have you reached? Didn't I ask you not to call me often? I'm on my way there. Hang up! He hung up. - Fayaskka? - Have you reached, Ramesh? Fayaskka, there's a problem. - What happened? - Kochi Airport is flooded, right? So, I'll be landing at Coimbatore airport. How is mom now? Hey! You don't have to worry. The doctor said she has passed the critical stage. And Anupama is here, right? Huh? Anu has come there? Well, she's the one who brought your mom to the hospital. She's here. I'll pass the phone to her. Okay. It's Ramesh, dear. Talk to him. There's some rice left. Should I pack it? Yes, take it. We'll give it at the camp. Ah! Hey Winston! Disconnect the TV. Dad, I'm going to Kochi. What's in Kochi now? Help us pack all this. I'm talking to dad. I have to attend a shoot. Shoot? You can't stay in the relief camp. That's why! It must be demeaning for your girlfriend's family, right? Hey! Don't talk nonsense! I won't consider that you're my elder brother. You don't have to. Come on! Yeah, I won't! Come on! I've been seeing this for a while now. You and your damn shooting! If you care about this family at least a little bit, will you give all that money you earned to that photographer? And you want to leave for Ernakulam right now? Listen! We work tirelessly at sea, to ensure you have three meals a day! Do you know that? Ungrateful scoundrel! Oh! Is that so? Now all of you are on one side? I don't want anything from you! I'm leaving! Go! Go wherever you want! Bloody... Damn.... This is really nice. So many boats are there! Sir, that was last year. This year, so many boats. Many people! Big crowd! Parking and all... no chance. - Oh my God! - Boat song! Boat song! [singing the boat song] Nice! Wow! [Welcome to the Boat Race Event] Where are the boats? Sir... I will just come. You enjoy the place. What's it, Ravi? Has there been a power outage at your house? So, you didn't know anything? A cyclonic depression is being formed. There will be a deluge. Everything will be submerged. There will be a power outage. We should be cautious. Has he gone crazy? As another cyclonic depression has formed in the Arabian Sea, the meteorological department has informed that severe rains will continue. The Chief Minister has summoned an emergency meeting at Aluva Guest House. Sir! There are around 79 dams of various sizes in Kerala. Almost all of them are currently at full capacity. Moreover, the rains are only getting stronger. And we've received a message from the Centre, that there's a possibility to form another cyclonic depression. We are headed towards an unprecedented situation. The public hasn't realized the seriousness of these problems yet. We should handle this with extreme caution. Even if the media that's waiting outside gets the slightest of hints, it could cause widespread panic among the public. Then, the situation will become even more dangerous. Our objective should be to find a solution without inducing panic. I need constant updates on all developments. Yes, sir. ♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday to You ♪ Hello? - Hello? Have you left? I'm about to leave. Do you want me to buy something? Great! Did you forget? Hey, it's your daughter's birthday on the 22nd. I've sent you a long list on WhatsApp. Check it and tell me. Yeah, I'll look into it. Give them proper awareness. Don't inform the media. Guys, listen! We have been warned that, heavy rainfall and gusty wind are highly likely in the coming hours. Two major cyclonic depressions have been forecasted. This is unprecedented. Over the last five years, the sea surface temperature... has risen by 2 degree Celsius in many regions. There's a possibility to form two or more... cyclonic depressions in the Arabian Sea. If that happens, we will have to face a catastrophic deluge. Anything can happen in the coming days. Chetta, what happened to the boat race? The boat race was cancelled at midnight yesterday, due to severe rains. And we had prepared a lot of items here. Therefore, all those who are either, on duty or on leave, must be present in this control room. No matter what, we should not mess anything up! - Okay? - Okay, Ma'am! Sir, I'll show your cabin. - Hello? - I heard it, Shajiyetta. Don't worry about us. Just call us when you're free. Mom, I am done! Give me the phone now! Madam, no boat race. Heavy rain! Boat race postponed to another day. Oh, God! What is our next plan? Sir, don't worry. Let’s see dam full of water. Cheruthoni, Idukki, Munnar. Fish-catching, fog, Neelakurinji flowers. Neelakurinji? It's nice! - Let's go there, Honey. - Come, come. Hey! I think he's cheating us. No! He's a good man. The rainfall during the '99 floods was much more severe than it is currently. While many other areas were flooded during that time, not even a drop of water entered this area. So many other places would be flooded right now. Have we faced any trouble here? No! It's not like the old days. The temperature of the sea-water has increased. Low-pressure areas will be formed. There will be a deluge. There's no point talking to him. You do one thing. Go and build an ark like Noah. Go on! Go! Fool! He's so stupid! I'm currently at the main gateway between the northern and southern districts, Aluva. The flooding in Aluva is worse than expected. Water is flooding the entire town. Fear is spreading among the public. We've never seen rains like this earlier. We can see that the entire state of Kerala is being submerged in the ongoing heavy rainfall. Alex! Where are you? I'm at the collection centre in the school. What are you doing there? Aren't you aware of what's happening, Alex? When a calamity strikes our town, you should be more responsible. Many camps in Kerala are experiencing a shortage of essentials. I'm doing whatever I can. Can you please come here, Anoop? What is it, Manju? - One minute. - One minute. You should also do your bit. I'll call you later. I'm busy. Okay, okay! Carry on. - Hello. - Anu. How is mom doing now? She has been shifted to the room. She's sleeping now. She regained consciousness once. Doctor said that there are no other issues. I'm taking a train to get there, okay? I had to land at Coimbatore airport, right? Do you remember our trip to Chennai for Sudhi's wedding? It's the same train. - Hello? - Yeah, okay. Ashok. Ramesh. Where to? Kochi? - Yes, Kochi. - I'm going to Thrissur. I'm going to my sister's house. - My brother-in-law is a Malayali. - Okay. What? Steamed tapioca and black tea would be a good combination now. - Sir? - I'm on a call. Listen! This is a WhatsApp group called 'Save Kerala'. Someone added me to this group. And when I cross checked, all the information seems to be genuine. I double-checked it. So, you should follow up on all the information you receive on this group. We need many more people now. We haven't been able to extend any help to isolated areas and camps. At present, our plan is to use helicopters to air-drop food and other essentials. But that's not the major issue we're facing. Among the people who are trapped, there are women and girls. We need to consider their private needs too. We need quite a lot of people to pack vital essentials for each individual. We can't do this task on our own. And we cannot force anyone to do anything for us. We need some efficient people who are ready to do anything. Reflect on what we can do to tackle this issue. Sir, based on what Ma'am said, shall we send a message on this WhatsApp group? Very well! We don't have time even to answer calls. So, how will a WhatsApp message help? No, no. It's a good idea! Pack 25 of them in each box. - The count should be correct, okay? - Sir! Sir, we had sent a message on the WhatsApp group asking for volunteers, right? - Yes. - Come with me, Sir! Youngsters who are generally branded as loafers, freaks and Tik-Tok addicts... We're witnessing their emergence as a helping hand to the people of Kerala. ["Anbodu Kochi" group with a helping hand] [Shutters of Banasurasagar, Malampuzha, Peppara dams will be raised further] [TV news continues] In Kaloor Regional Sports Centre collection centre... many essentials good are being collected and sorted. Lots of committed volunteers have come forward for this cause. What happened, Mathacha? You've been glued on to the TV for a while! You must be checking whether Nixon is among them, right? Well, he never does any work that requires physical effort, right? - He doesn't like to sweat. - So don't look for him among them. Hey, stop talking and play your card. Isn't your dad here? He is not here. He had asked me to come here. Dad is not here. Hey! Where are you going? The bridge has collapsed! We have to go to Munnar. The bridge has collapsed. You can go only via Aruvikkulam now. Take this road and then turn left. Come. Damn this rain! This State was called 'God's own country'! We've only seen hurricanes and floods hitting other places on TV. And look what happened now! Earlier, the sight of rain... had a soothing effect on our minds. But right now, to be frank... I just want this rain to stop, somehow. Rail transport has been disrupted due to a landslide... caused by heavy rains near Walayar in Palakkad district. The Chennai-Trivandrum Mail train was impacted by the landslide. Our reporter Arun is joining us now with more details. Was anyone injured in the accident, Arun? What information have you received from there? Shucks! Hey, where are you now? I am at the relief camp. What is it, Chetta? Nothing. - Okay then. - How can you do that? - You can't believe it? I can't believe it! Hey, the load contains more than just bombs. There are food items, medicines and a lot of other stuff too. So stop worrying, tie the banner and get going. Go, go! Okay. They said water won't rise here, right? I will tie it! Take the items from inside! Dude, water is rising everywhere. So, it's probably rising here too. It will go away. Move it quickly. Do we need to bring all that stuff up here? Of course! Let's do it quickly. I've to go somewhere else with this vehicle. - Vehicle? - Yes, the boat! Hold that tarpaulin up! Why are you standing still? I've been calling you for so long. Why can't you answer the calls? I didn't call anyone else since you promised to come. No one will answer your calls, man! You're the younger brother of "Fox" Cleetus, right? - Hello? - Who's this idiot now? Slide it down! Where are you rowing your car to? We are going to Munnar, Chetta. What? Wow, great! Are you taking them there to get them killed? Hey foreigner! There, full mud! You go, you dead! Explain it to them, dude. Oh my God! Koshy, what we can do now? I don't know, dear sir! Dude, those are foreigners, right? That's right. Sweetheart, let's go to hotel. Enough for today! Koshy, please ask them about some home-stay or hotel. It's about time they caught on! I have other work. Tell me. Is there any hotel or home-stay nearby, Chetta? Home-stay in this remote village? You idiot! Take your car and leave! There are no home-stays here! Your vehicle may be needed for a trip. What? Dude, haven't you set up a tent in your house? Yes. Dude, home-stay! 'Stay' in my 'home'? Yes! You are brilliant! - Let's go and see. - Yes. The car will be safe here, right? Sure, of course! - Nice! - What's your name? - Anoop. - Anoop. Okay. What is your name? Susan. Susan. Okay. What is your father's name? Oh, that's my husband! Patrick. Oh no! Sorry, sorry! Don't tell him! Where are you from? America? I'm from Poland. This is boat race, Sir! Have you been to Poland? No, no. Waiting for visa... Dubai. [singing boat race song] Who are these people? - This is my home. - Oh, nice! Nice house! Boss, are we going to stay here? Yes. - You have guests! - Who are these people? You have no idea how connected I am. Susan and Patrick came all the way from Poland to attend my wedding. I told you, right? My father, my mother, my marriage broker! - Hi! - Hi! Nice to meet you, marriage broker! - Welcome to Kerala! - Thank you! - My name is Mary Thomas. - Oh, fantastic name! Police Constable, Kerala Police! - Wow! - She is police. Police? Very nice! Dad, did you call me? Where the hell are you? - I am at Anoop's house. Didn't you notice the water rising? Water has flooded our property. - Come home quickly! - Okay, I'm coming. Well, do we have to shift to the relief camp? Shall we go to Josachayan's house? Relief camp? Over my dead body! Hey, Chandykunju didn't build this two storied house for nothing! Hurry up! We have to move all this stuff upstairs. Okay, I'm coming. Hey, come here quickly! We have to move this TV upstairs. Where can we get a taxi? We will go forward and see if we can find one. Okay. Ashok! Brother, brother! - Stop, brother! - Chetta! - Stop, brother! - Stop, Chetta! Brother! - Stop, brother! - Please, Chetta! - Please stop! - Chetta! - Stop, brother! - Please, Chetta! - Brother... please! - Please stop, Chetta! Hey! [Aruvikkulam Residents' Association] Hey, it's flooded everywhere! The water was only up to my knees when I came here. The water rose so fast, it's unbelievable! Dude, shall we collect these floating coconuts and put them in the boat? They can be used to make chutney! Sheesh! Don't be such a miser, man! Well, I don't have a light and sound shop like you! Turn it. Don't hit that wall. Where are you going, boys? We are going to his house. That entire area is flooded. Oh no! - Where are you going? - We're going to the camp. Everyone is relocating to the camp. - We'll go there and come back. - Okay. Walk carefully! As soon as we reach your house, we will move everything upstairs, and then head over to my place. Dude, I don't think my dad will come along. - We will convince your dad. - God only knows! Uncle Anoop! Hey, Sneha! Uncle, can you come here? - What happened? - Come here! We are waiting for a boat. - I can come there. - It's okay. The boat will come. It's okay. I will come. Okay. - Come, dear. - My bag. - Alex... - Go and drop them first. I can walk from here. Okay. - I will drop them and come back. - Okay. Careful. Don't be scared, dear. Come, come. Give it. Hold my hand. Careful! You loser! Didn't you find any other vehicle to die in front of? Why are you standing in the middle of the road? Bro, please drop me on the way! I've been waiting here for a while, but no vehicles seem to be stopping. Public transport and trains are both unavailable. Even we have to get home, right? - Please give us a lift, bro. - Lift? Is this how you ask for a lift? Don't you have any sense? That was a mistake. Please forgive me. Aren't you human too? I can't give you a lift. Get lost. Please wait for a minute, bro! Just a minute, bro! My sister is alone at home, bro. Please help me, bro! Okay. Get in, damn it! Thanks bro. Brother! Come on! Bro, he's my friend. Let's go. Sir, this is not right. If we open the dam at this last moment, what will the people do? This is just one dam for now. There are several other dams of varying sizes as well. Millions of people reside along the banks of those dams. And the sea is at high tide now. We can't expect all this water to flow to the sea quickly. It's too dangerous! Shaji, just do your job. Okay? It's not like that, Sir. The mainland will face severe flooding. We need to alert the public before that. If we don't shift people to the camps at the earliest, That's the job of the District Administrators. I'll give you a job to do. He is giving me advice! Hey! I'm giving the helpline numbers to all the news channels. Expect a surge of calls, like water from the dam. Note down all of them. If anyone is stuck, exchange the details. Understood? And he's talking about high tide in between that! What do I say? Is it better to save people after trapping them, or to save them before they are trapped? Think about it, Sir. What are you gaping at? Do your job! Carry on! Carry on! Hello? Sir! Sir? Okay, sir! Oh no! Oh God! Sir! There's a problem! Hey! Hey! Wake up! Water is entering our house. - Wake our child up! Gather our belongings. - What? Come! Huh? - Oh no! - Chetta! Sir, the lower Periyar dam has also been opened. We've been stuck on top of this house for the past two days. We have no food or drinking water. We can't even get some milk for this child. Is there anyone who can help us? Please! What do we do? Sir, We don't have enough boats or life jackets... to carry out the rescue operations safely. The Government boats are not... equipped to handle strong currents. Tell me about what we have with us now, man! Sir, shall we try seeking the help of the Navy? The Navy and Military won't assume control until tomorrow. We need to make it through tonight, shouldn't we? What about the people who are stuck? Sir, air-lifting attempts are currently underway. The roofs of most houses are covered with tiles or shingles. Hence, we cannot determine the number of... ...people stuck in each of those houses, sir. The water level has reached the... second floors of these houses already. So, it would be wise to conduct the rescue... operations by entering the water. [TV News : Not as a legislator...] Increase the volume! Listen to me, as a fellow human! Tens of thousands of people are stuck here, around me. This is a remote area! If the Indian Army or fire-force... don't reach here at the earliest, at least ten thousand people will drown to death by sunrise. The increase in water level is... far greater than you can imagine. All of us are standing on top of the second floor now. The water has reached up to here. Any further delay in our rescue... will hold you accountable for the deaths of thousands. Please! Please save us! Come! Joy, keep this in that shelf. Father! What is it, Mathachan? Any problem at the camp? What could be worse than our entire... state being submerged in water, Father? This is all that's being telecast on TV as well. When even the Government is unable to do anything, what can we do? - What are you saying, Father? - Father! What's causing the flooding on our land? It's water indeed, isn't it? This water can't be as dangerous as the... the ocean that we see every day! Come quickly! Come on! Don't know what's happening. You all are aware of what's happening currently, right? I know that many of our houses are flooded. I also know that it's not right to... say this to people living in camps. But... we are used to this. They are not! What the hell is this Priest saying? Hey! I'll keep it very short! We've all seen the news on TV, right? After witnessing people of all ages, from infants to the elderly, crying; how can we remain idle here? My father and I are taking our boat to help those in need. But if we go on a single boat, how many people can we rescue? That's why the Priest has summoned all of you. Is anyone ready to come with us? I am ready, Father! I am ready too, Father! I am ready too, Father! I am ready too, Father! I am ready too! Sir, there's a good news. What's happening? The Priest said they will be here now. [fishermen cheering] Come on, pull harder! [cheering continues] Don't let the left side slip. [cheering continues] Go ask them to bring the truck in reverse. Okay, sir. [cheering continues] [cheering continues] Lift it up! [cheering continues] Bring it that way! [cheering continues] - Good that we asked for two trucks. - Yes. Ask them to bring the second truck too! Yes, sir. [cheering continues] Sir, look! Over there! [cheering continues] Call the Regional Transport Office. Our vehicles have been called as death machines by the people. This is a golden opportunity we've got to clear our bad name. Our boys will come, sir. Surprising and unforeseen events are unfolding here. We can see that the fishermen have taken charge of the rescue operations. Announcing all kinds of co-operation and support for the rescue operations by the fishermen, District Administrators and higher police officials have come forward. The fishermen have literally emerged as the guardian angels of Kerala. Push it! Come on, push it! Heave ho! Hey! Lift that side up! [cheering continues] [cheering continues] Let's do it together, Dasetta! Come on, cheer! Heave ho! Come on, pull it up! Heave ho! Popeye, go and save everyone! [cheering continues] Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho! [cheering continues] Yaay! Yaay! Yaay! The news that we've just got has brought a sense of relief. Fishermen from the different coastal regions in Kerala... are en route to assist with rescue efforts. Bringing the boats they use to make a living at sea, the angels of Kerala are arriving from different... coastal regions of the state. Real life heroes! Thousands of stranded people are thanking them with folded hands. Bro! Hey! Get lost! Sorry, bro! - Brother, see you. - Okay. Travel safe. Thanks, bro. Sigh! Brother! Could you please give me your phone? I need to call my family. Please! Thank you. - Hello? - Anu, it's me! Rameshetta, which is this phone number? I've been trying to call you for so long. Couldn't you inform us? All of us got so stressed here. Are you all right, Etta? Yeah, I am alright. I am on my way. How is mom doing? She is fine. I'll pass the phone to her. - Son... - Mom! Where are you? When we couldn't reach you, I was really worried. You are fine, right? Yes, Mom. I am fine. I'm on my way. You don't have to worry, okay? Okay. Bye. Please come. Be careful. It's slippery here. Careful! Carry the child! Come, come. Slowly. - Rametta, switch on the generator. - Quick! Brother, it doesn't look like the rain is going to end any time soon. What do we do? I had warned you... that this low-pressure area will bring trouble, didn't I? Sir, we've sent three vehicles to Kunjithanny. - Should I send another one to 16th Mile? - Yes, do it quickly! - Bring maximum number of people. - Okay, sir. Master! - Bhasi Chettan? - Vehicles have gone to bring them. They will be brought here soon. Careful. Sister, can you help her? - Hello? - Yes! Where are you? I couldn't get through to you. There's no signal here. Where are your parents? - Your house isn't flooded, right? - No. They are at home. I'm at the college relief camp now. At the camp? Have you gone crazy? Just go home quickly! Or you wait there. I'll come there. Don't be stressed, Anoop. It's all okay here. Where are you now? I'm at the school relief camp. Listen to me! I will come there and drop you home. Don't be so selfish, Anoop! How can I stay idle at home when so many people are suffering here? - Come there. - Just a minute. I'll call you later. Call me if you need anything at that camp. Ashwin and Rahul are here. I'm hanging up. Bye. - Hey! Hold this! - Are you loading goods on to this? We have to take people in this! So, should I abandon expensive stuff here? Shucks! More people have to be taken in this! Whom are you going to take? Shouldn't we take Bhasi Chettan? Bhasi Chettan's house is atop a hill. How will it get flooded? He's our neighbour, after all. You shut up! - Bhasi Chetta! - Yes. I'll send another vehicle! Okay! Look where the blind man has built his house! Bhasi Chetta, we'll go and send the vehicle back. - Okay. - Start the vehicle, you moron! What are you gaping at? Hey! Come, let's eat something. ... most petrol bunks are closed due to flooding. - What would you like to eat? - Nothing. Fine! [news continues on television] We don't have anyone. My daughter is in the hospital. We just got here yesterday. Manu, we're not sure how many people are trapped underground. Many people have gathered here, expecting to save the lives of their family members. Though the fire-force and the townsfolk are trying their best, we don't know how many people can be rescued alive yet. It's quite difficult to describe the current situation here, Manu. Because, you can only understand the pain of this situation by experiencing it first-hand. There is speculation among the people here that further landslides may occur. So, the townsfolk and the fire-force are trying their best to shift the people here to a safer destination. Isn't this your wallet? You forgot it over there. Is she your only daughter? I had seen her photo. What's your daughter's name? You are fine, dear. Nothing will happen to you. Don't worry, dear. They will be here now. Dear... Don't worry, dear. Oh God! Can you confirm the exact location? - Subin? - Yes. Earlier, the helpline centre received a call to shift a pregnant lady to the hospital. That's from my town. Check whether an air-lift is possible and let me know. Okay, I will check. Sir, that was confirmed earlier. They would have reached there by now. - Very good. - Hello? Dude, it's a helicopter! Ah!

Somebody, please come! We are trapped here. - Please save us! - Help! We are witnessing a heart-warming act of kindness as a migrant labourer shares the blankets he brought to make a living with, with his fellow Malayali brothers and sisters. Sir, you've come all the way from Tamil Nadu to help us, enduring the heavy rainfall and winds. - What do you have to say about this? - Just a minute, sir. Hello, who is it? Hello, son? Are you about to reach here? Aunty... I am not your son. I have dropped him. He will be home soon. You don't worry. Okay. Thank you so much! May God bless you and your family, son. Essential items are arriving in large numbers from other states in the country. Apart from food and medicines, clothes have also arrived. From Tamil Nadu... Hello? Mom! Have you eaten something, Mom? I have eaten, son. How about you? Yes, I have eaten. What is it, son? Why do you sound different? It's nothing, Mom. What's my daughter doing? She is right here. I'll put her on. - Baby! - Yes! Come here. Come on! Your dad is on the phone. Talk to him. Okay. Hello? Baby! Did you eat, dear? Yes, Dad. How about you? Yes. I'm on my way home, dear. Do you want something? No, Dad. I don't need anything. I'll be happy if you get here soon. Okay, dear. I will come quickly. Okay. Don't cry, son. Don't cry! What happened? Oh no! It's all right. Go, be with our son. Mom! Oh no! Just go to him! Go! I'm all right! Dad! Dad is all right, son. Oh God! What do we do? Bastin! The bottom is slightly damaged. Let it be! Nothing is more important than human lives! Hey! What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a fisherman earlier? Get down, Chetta. Come, dear. Hey! Hey! Can you do me a favour? A girl has gone missing from the camp. She's her daughter. - It's her daughter. - She is missing! She has a civil services interview next week. She left her certificates behind in a hurry. Don't know whether she went back to get them. Someone who knows the place can come with us then. Hey! You take rest for some time, Dad. I'll go with my brother-in-law. Come on, bro! - Calm down, dear. - My daughter! They are going, right? - I am so worried, Chechi. - She will be back. - My daughter! - She will be fine! Don't worry. Let them go and check. - He is my son! - Really? He is very smart! Be careful, son! - Hey! It's Meera! - Huh? Meera! What have you done, Meera! Everyone is looking for you over there. Couldn't you tell someone before leaving? Come, hop on to the boat. My certificates! Let it be. It's all right. Come, hop on. Come. Chetta, my certificates! Let's go, bro! We've come all the way here, right? Now we'll go only after taking those certificates. Dude, he is awesome. - Nice, right? - Look, it's Anoopettan. Hi, Chetta. Hi! - Let me help you with it, Chetta. - Here you go. - Where's Manju Teacher? - She's on the other side. - You did a great job, son. I saw it. - Thank you, thank you. We saw it on our phones. You did great! You are awesome, Chetta. Look! This is that guy! I heard that the ex-military man received tremendous applause! Did you think that the training given by the Indian Army would go to waste? Your mom called me. She said she couldn't reach you. Oops! My phone was inside this. I'll call her. Wait. I'll call her. No. You can do it after drying my hair. Hold this. - Hello, Mom? - Hey! Where are you? Everyone is asking for you. It's a great atmosphere out here. The Madam is extracting coconut milk. It's so much fun. Is it Anoop? Ask him to come quickly. Hey! Koshy is asking for you. You know what it is for, right? I'll arrange all that. Well, Mom. Did you see that video? - Please come, dear. - Just a minute, son. What? Can you give me the phone? Hello! Mom, could you send a gas cylinder here if you have an extra one at home? - It's almost over here. - Why not, dear! We have an extra cylinder here. I'll send it with Anoop when he comes. And yeah! Please send him here quickly, okay? - Okay, Mom. - Give it to me. She hung up? Chechi, please come. Look! - What is it? - Will this much coconut milk be enough? - Let me see. - Should we make some more for the dessert? That's right. We might need more for the dessert. - I'll bring some more coconuts. - Okay. Hey! Can I get a stretcher? To take Abin to the hospital? How can we let him stay in the camp in this situation? Oh no! So, he's not at the school camp? So, he's not here? When I called Varghese Chettan, he said he was waiting for a vehicle to to go the school camp. And we couldn't reach him after that. Where did they go then? You will be alright, son. Oh no! Ichaya! Dad! - Dad! - Ichaya! - Dad! - Ichaya! It's okay. It's alright, son. It's alright. - Dad! - Don't cry, dear. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Sir, it's Roy sir. Hello? Hey! I'm going to Abin's house. He's not at the college camp either. And I can't get through to Varghese Chettan. Don't get stressed. Different boats have gone to different places. They must have been dropped off at the hospital. I'm near Meera's house. Huh? - Hello? - Hello? Hello? Hello? Chetta! It's in the room to your left. Inside the wooden cupboard! - Huh? - It's in the room to your left. Inside a wooden cupboard. Okay. Have some tea. Well, why are you standing here? You can sit inside. Sir! The roof tiles in the classroom have collapsed. Please come quickly. They said it fell on someone's leg. Hey! Move aside! Please move! Make way! Please move, dear. Please move aside! And you've made her lie down right under that again? Shift her to the hospital. Come on, lift her up. Come on! I think the school will lose its accreditation once the rain stops. This is so sad, oh God! - Well, you will be blamed for that, sir. - Sir! Water is still rising. Are there any other camps nearby? There's a camp at the college. Make arrangements to shift everyone to the college camp then. What do we do about the tiles? There a couple of tiles outside, right? - Why do you need tiles now, sir? - Well, the school's... - Do you have extra tiles? - Yes. - Go, bring it then. - Okay. - Come on! - Hey! You come here. Move this. Okay. Oh no! Your leg is wounded! Hey! It's just a small wound. Hey! Don't bother now. Let's check once we reach the camp. I've brought all the files from that shelf. All of you wait outside. Go on! What happened, Mathachan? Come! Just help me out. Sir, one minute. Can you please come? Hey! What are you doing here? Everyone is going to the college. Go there! - Don't stay here. - Okay! Master, did you see my dad? Your dad is in the classroom. Go there! Hey! This desk... Son! Stop staring and shift those people to the college camp. Go! Shiyas, you go with him. Shiyas, he's not used to driving boats. So, just be cautious. - I'll handle it. - Hey! Stop it, Dad! Come on! Come on! Come, dear. Come, dear. Brother, don't come here. Go to the college camp. Water is rising here. Hey! Dad said so! Just go! Sir, do you need a panel or something? No. Let me see. The wall is collapsing! - Go out! - Run! Run! Run! Yes, Akhil. I am near Aruvikkulam now. Rain has not stopped yet. It has only grown stronger. We can see a very painful sight, right behind me. A new house that recently had its house-warming ceremony is now in a state of complete disrepair. Though the police and the townsfolk are ready to do everything possible to help, the situation is such that nobody can do anything. No one knows whether there are people inside the house. All of us tried calling several times. The town is praying that there are no people trapped inside the house. More landslides are also predicted. People are being evacuated from nearby areas. - This is the condition of the house now. - Shaji... Shaji... We haven't seen such a painful sight in a long time. This house which is a result of someone's blood, sweat and toil, is now being reduced to ruins. Even we cannot stand this sight! So, we cannot even imagine the situation of the owner of this house. Rescue operations... Shucks! Bloody rascals! Is this your rescue operation? I've been calling each one of you for a long time. None of you answered! Shouldn't you have some decency? You're just sitting here and dozing off! And you're calling this a rescue operation? Bloody scoundrels! Aren't you ashamed, you losers? Bloody son of a gun! You pig! In the process of saving your lives, their father died! And they are unable to even cry out loud. And you're talking such nonsense, you pig? No, Shiyas Ikka. Leave him. My younger brother's house was affected by a landslide. But he called me on my phone. I've been trying to call several people for a while. No one is ready to come. He is trapped beneath the ground. He has children too! Forgive me. I said that unknowingly. Somebody, please come with me. Come with me! Please come. I said that unknowingly. I swear! Please come! Hey! Don't cry, dear. Look! It's your ball. Your favourite! I'm unable to figure out the location. Call him! Isn't it ringing? - Hello! - Chetta! Chetta, we will call again. But don't answer the call. We're planning to trace you with your ringtone. Okay. Don't be scared, Chetta. We're coming right away. They are coming. They will come. Don't cry, dear. Calm down. They will come. Hey! Hey! It's over there. I heard it from there. It's coming from there. Over there. Come on! Don't cry, dear. - What happened? - It got switched off. Oh no! It got disconnected. What's happening? The phone got switched off. Josootty! Josootty, my dear! Where are you? Jiji! Jiji! Don't cry, son. Don't cry, son. It's nothing. Don't cry, son. Son! Aby! Abin! Varghese Chetta! Varghese Chetta! - Anoop! - Anoop! Varghese Chetta! Anoop! - Abin! - Anoop! - Anoop! - Varghese Chetta! - Anoop! - Varghese Chetta! - Varghese Chetta! - Anoop! Varghese Chetta! Varghese Chetta! Anoop! Anoop! Anoop! I'll climb up on my own. I'll go, bring the boat. Aby! Son! - Aby! - Son! Son, wake up! - Son! Son! - Aby! He is not waking up! - Abin! - Anoop! - Son! - Hey! Aby! - Son, wake up! Anoop! - Hey Abin! - Ichaya! - Abin! My son! Wake up, Aby! Abin! Hey! - Hey! - Son! - Aby! - Wake up! Hey Abin! Hey! - Wake up, son! - Aby! Hey! Hey! - Aby! - My son! Aby! Aby! Aby! My son! My son! My dear son! My son! Aby! Son! Abin! Hey! Abin! Ichaya! Hey! Son! Oh no! Son! - Son! Son! - My dear son! My son! Thank God! My dear son! - Hey Roly-Poly! You scared us! Is it you, Joekuttan? Are you playing with the cat? Didn't you go to the camp? Your Papa has gone there already. Joekuttan? Why are you silent? Joekuttan! It's not Joekuttan? Cleetus! Cleetus! Have you brought the vehicle? Why isn't anyone saying anything? Cleetus! Cleetus! Where have all these people gone? Cleetus! Nobody is here? Bhasi Chetta! Where are they? Bhasi Chetta! Where is he? Oh no! Chetta! - Bhasi Chetta! - It's flooded there. Bhasi Chetta! Chetta! Don't step down. - Wait! - Don't step down. Anoop! Is it you? Chetta, there's water in front of you! Oh no! Oh my God! Oh no! Oh no! Look! Chetta! Chetta! - Anoop! - Anoop! - Anoop! - Uncle Anoop! Uncle Anoop! Anoop!

We are now in Aruvikkulam village, which has been resurrected from the disasters caused by the deluge. The fishing boat called "Mother Mary" that protected the people of this village during the deluge is being preserved as a monument. And this idea was proposed by the school students of this village. Though it was partly damaged during the rescue operations, "Mary Matha" will be an eternal memorial of the will power of Malayalis.
