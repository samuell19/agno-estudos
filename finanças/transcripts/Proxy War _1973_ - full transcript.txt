TOEl COMPANY PRESENTS Shozo Hirono and a group of young men who returned from the battlefield after the war ended in 1945 joined the underground world. They built up a yakuza family under Boss Yoshio Yamamori at Kure in Hiroshima Prefecture. With Hirono and his men putting their lives on the line, the Yamamori family gradually grew into a great kingdom. As their power expanded, they were split into factions from within. Under bosses were felled, one after another, by Yamamori's design, and Hirono himself left Yamamori's gang. Time passed, and by 1960, the struggle against US security dominance, the Kishi Cabinet's demise, Asanuma's assassination and other tumultuous events reflected the actual chaotic conditions of Japan in those days. Similar conflicts were simultaneously erupting all over the globe. As all these wars reflected the interests of either the US or the Soviets, such regional conflicts began to be referred to as proxy wars. These tendencies also began to appear in Japanese yakuza society, as Japan gradually emerged from its postwar chaos.

Why don't you go to Tokyo? The Uchimoto family has a large circle of acquaintances there. Yes, but I'm just released on parole. I can't leave Kure City limits due to residential restrictions. Comet think of it, we haven't celebrated your release yet. Why don?t we have a pro wrestling show and celebrate? Wakamatsu, this is the fellow who's been like a brother to me. All of you remember him, don?t you? Yes. Welcome. Then I'll ask and look for a booth. I leave it entirely to you. Hello, Mr. Sugihara! Who's he? He's just a punk. You bastard! Move! Move! Damn it! Sugihara! In September 1960, Fumio Sugihara, a member of the Muraoka family, the largest yakuza family in Hiroshima, was shot to death in a bold daylight attack. Sugihara was the sworn brother of the boss of the Muraoka family and held the reins of the family while Muraoka was under medical treatment. He had been its virtual leader. CAPTAI N OF THE MURAOKA FAMI LY HI ROSHI MATSUNAGA UNDERBOSS OF THE MURAOKA FAMILY AKIRATAKEDA Excuse me. What's wrong? Who the hell is that? Kuriyama from kyushu. He came to see our ailing boss. Kuriyama? I heard Sugihara beat him bad over some gambling incident. So that guy planned all this! It's all his doing, and he dares to puke? Mr. Uchimoto, you have to handle this problem as a sworn brother. If you do it, I'll help you. Hirono, he's Muraoka's guest. Mr. Uchimoto, we are indebted to Mr. Sugihara, and if you do it, we'll pretend to know nothing of it. Well, but, I can't revolt against brother Muraoka. Uchimoto is in second place to Sugihara, and his weak-kneed attitude at this time will cause complications in the Muraoka family's inheritance later, and will also be the future cause of the biggest struggle in Western Japan. KURE CITY, HI ROSHI MA Meanwhile, Hirono had set up a small family in Kure, Hiroshima, guarding scrap metal. Idiot! A MEMBER OF THE HI RONO FAMI LY KATSUHARU SAIJO You're supposed to be guarding against thieves, not stealing yourself! How much did you make from the scrap you stole? More than 200,000 yen. Fucking shithead! Hand over the money. But my woman asked me to buy a TV set, And I bought it yesterday. Dumb fuck! ATV set? You damned idiot. Boss! Let me go! BOSS OF THE UEDA FAMILY TOSHIO UEDA Hirono, what happened? Hey, let him go. What do you want? Mr. Okubo's asking you to come to see him. - Mr. Okubo? - Yes. The chief parole officer and your sponsor are at his house. At this time, Hirono was still on parole for murder, and elder Kenichi Okubo, who had resigned, was his only advisor. Yasuda, your guarantor has to take care of many other people besides you. So I talked with Mr. Okubo about your guarantor, ELDER KENICHI OKUBO and decided to ask Mr. Yamamori to be your guarantor. What do you say? Mr. Yamamori? He's trusted among members of the business community. We can leave this to him without any anxiety. Can we expect him to agree, even if we ask? Yamamori suggested it himself. He understands now he needs a fellow like you for his family. And it makes your world narrow to hold a grudge against him in such a small town. And until you can get on in the world, why don?t you reconcile with him for your own future? Yes. Since I recommended it, you needn't hesitate, unless you plan on giving up the yakuza world. I don't intend to do that, but let me think it over for two or three days. Hey, Hirono. BOSS OF THE YAMAMORI FAMILY IN KURE YOSHIOYAMAMORI UNDERBOSS OF THE YAMAMORI FAMILY MASAKICHI MAKIHARA I got a summons, too. What?s the deal? Nothing special, in my case. Is that so? Come to my house and have dinner sometime. You must know that Mr. Muraoka resigned from his position due to his physical condition. But who will be his successor? I don't know. My boss has a branch in Hiroshima. That's why it's on my mind. You have a large circle of acquaintances. If you?ve heard something, let me know. Oh, I get it. That's why you need me. You're always scheming. Hi, boss. What happened? I told him to cut off his finger, but he said two or three fingers aren't enough. We tried to stop him. He cut off his own hand with a hatchet. Shitbrain! That was a fuckin' stupid thing to do! How you gonna fight now? I have a weapon. Let me go! I'm sorry. It was all because of me that he sold that scrap. Forget it! Just take him home! See that a doctor looks after that. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Call Mr. Okubo. The next day, Hirono returned to the Yamamori family through Mr. Kenichi Okubo. Hello! Please come in. Full house. Yes, thank you, but it's a little flat. Shout at them. Left to themselves, they don't really fight. Hi. How was the match? I lost on a foul. UNDERBOSS OF THE UCHIMOTO FAMILY HIDEO HAYAKAWA Idiot! Does the audience like to see you lose on a foul to a foreign wrestler? Go fight him again. Tell him it's a grudge match. But that?s not allowed. What the fuck! Now you?ve got your grudge. We'll let you fuck Miss Hiroshima later. Now get your ass back out there! Please. Hirono. Iwai, thank you for coming. UNDERBOSS OF AKASHI FAMILY IN KOBE SHINICHI IWAI I was just passing through and dropped in. How are you? I'm getting by. - Here's a little something. - Thanks. Have a seat, will you? I hear Iwai's the leader of the Akashi family's shock troops. You sure have a lot of friends. I envy you. I traveled a lot when I was young. So I made friends all over. All the guys I hook up with seem to get themselves killed. I feel like I haven't got anyone to turn to. Hirono, could you ask Iwai for someone from his family to be my sworn brother? I'll ask, but the Akashi family is much bigger than families here, so you better think it over before you ask. I already have. Mr. Muraoka's in such a bad way, he's gonna have to name a successor soon. Who could manage the family besides me? Having an Akashi brother would make me that much stronger, and not a bad deal for the Akashis either. Uchimoto, if you cozy up to outsiders just so you can be boss, it could come back to bite you later. You're so old-fashioned. These days, you got to have a wide circle of friends. It?s the age of international relations. You got to be smart. Is that so? I'm content being simple-minded. Mr. Yamamori must have his sights on Hiroshima, too. Isn't that why he wanted you back, Hirono? Hayakawa, you being sarcastic? How should I know what he has in mind? Damn it! She ain't no Miss Hiroshima! I'm leaving! Wait a second! Saijo! I made him a promise, so get him a good-looking girl! Pretend to be Miss Hiroshima? No way! You're always full of shit! I refuse! You have to. It's mud on my face if you don't. Uh, Miss Hiroshima. No way! I'm not letting that ugly monsterfuck me! His dick's just like all the others. Check it out. - No! - Hey, think of the boss's kindness. - Come on. - Ouch! What the fuck? You got a problem? Bastard! Stop! Stop it! What are you looking at? This isn't a show! You bastard! Get up! I'll kill you! AWORKERAND FUTURE MEMBER OF THE HIRONO FAMILY, TAKESHI KURAMOTO Look! There it is! Hurry up! - Is Hirono in? - Hirono? Who are you calling Hirono? Come on in. Don't be afraid. Their idiot of a boss used to be a student of mine. He was going to give himself up to the police, but he said wherever he went, he'd be retaliated against. That?s why he asked for my help. Since you?re both my students, it's like you're the big brother. Please help him. I understand. The guy was hurt, but he didn't die. I'll settle the problem. Don?t worry about it. Oh, that's fine. You're lucky, Kuramoto. Say thank you. Go on, say it! Now, then... about his future. Could you let him train under you? He's a firecracker, but he might have a future in your world. I recommend him. That's hardly the way I expect educators to talk. What were you? A welder in Osaka. You can't support yourself as a welder? I don't care about money. Then why don?t you live an honest life? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't air his dirty laundry, but his father was a yakuza in Fuchu and was killed fighting. Really? That?s the kind of father he grew up with. So, his mother seems to have given up on him already. You're his mother, right? If he becomes a yakuza, he has to desert his own mother. Is that okay by you? Yes, half the responsibility for his sins lies with me. So please take care of him. Your bellyband is also inside. Turn her sandals! Thank you. Be patient. Say good-bye and see her off! Mother! That summer, Shoichi Eda was released from Hiroshima prison. He was one of Muraoka's most energetic under bosses UNDERBOSS OF THE MURAOKA FAMI LY SHOICHI EDA who'd played a key role in the family's rise. Soon, at Uchimoto's suggestion, Uchimoto, Hirono and others exchanged vows as sworn brothers with under bosses of the Muraoka family, and Uchimoto stood at the top of a new generation in Hiroshima. What's this about Boss Yamamori hauling away some scrap? He said you'd approved it. Took two truckfuls. Two truckfuls? It'll cost five million yen. I wasn't sure I believed him, but I couldn't refuse an order from your boss. I can't have you hauling away scrap without my approval. You could ruin my reputation. Don't get all angry. One of my friends couldn't pay his bills, so I had to help him out. Then I'll go talk to him. Who is he? Mind your own business! Don't forget who got you this job guarding scrap. I did! If you?re gonna complain, I can get your ass fired anytime I want. Listen, Hirono. The boss is your guarantor. If you so much as speak against him, you'll be thrown in jail again. Forget it. He trusts Uchimoto more than he trusts me. What a joke! That idiot Uchimoto already fancies himself Muraoka's successor. There's no way that bastard's gonna be the next boss. Tell him it's ten years too soon! Go to Hiroshima. - You're an eyesore here in Kure. - Oh, yeah? If you mess with my job again, I'll take care of things my own way. Beat it! I can't stand the sight of you. What's all the shouting about? Mr. Eda came to see you. Thanks for taking care of my men while I was away, boss. Eda, thanks for coming. Now that you're back, everything will be fine in Hiroshima. Here's a little something to celebrate your release. Take it. That's very thoughtful of you. Come on. Come on inside. Thank you. Hirono, you come in, too. No, thank you. JUNE 1961 - KOBE The following June, Hirono visited the Akashi family in Kobe with Uchimoto at Uchimoto's insistence. Hirono also knew that helping Uchimoto now, could be a crucial step in ensuring his own future. The Akashi family approved Uchimoto's proposal. BOSS OF THE AKASHI FAMI LY I N KOBE TATSUO AKASHI Shigeo Aihara, the sworn brother SWORN BROTHER OF AKASHI FAMI LY BOSS SHIGEO AIHARA of Boss Tatsuo Akashi of the Akashi family, AKASHI'S CAPTAIN OF YOUNGER RANKS TERUO MIYAJI became a sworn brother to Uchimoto. That fall, a big celebration was held. At the time, one obstacle stood in the way of Akashi dominance across Japan: Their major rival in Kobe, the Shinwa Group. CHAI RMAN OF THE SHI NWA GROUP KUMASHI RO UNOKICHI The struggle in Western Japan UNDERBOSS OF THE SHINWA GROUP GIICHI ITAMI became more and more violent. OSAKA JUNE 1961 THE OSAKA GIYU FAMILY INCIDENT Out of the way! NARA JULY 1961 BOSS OF ISHIKAWA FAMILY KILLED KYOTO AUGUST 1961 STRUGGLE IN KYOTO Where are you guys from? TOTTORI OCTOBER 1961 -THE BOSS OF THE HIYAMA FAMILY IN TOTTORI KILLED FUKUOKA MAY 1962 THE HAKATA INCIDENT IN KYUSHU Ina battle that became known as the Hakata incident, the Akashi family sent lwai and some 300 men to Kyushu. Due to police mobilization, the conflict was held in check. But the gangland strife did not cease. Under these conditions, Hiroshima became a flash point for both the Akashi family and Shinwa Group. I heard it was a big event in kyushu. Iwai went to help them and was jailed. I just came back from the jail in Fukuoka. He said he needed your help. I see. So I came to consult with you. Will Mr. Uchimoto be Mr. Muraoka's successor? I can't really say yet, but I intend to do what I can to help. Good. And one more thing. What connection does Uchimoto have with Muraoka? Why? Mr. Muraoka is his boss. Fully formalized? Yeah, but why? The impudent son of a bitch. He wants to swear loyalty to Mr. Akashi as boss, and he's got somebody talking to Mrs. Akashi about it. Which is fine, but he's gone behind my back to do it. Who in the world would hide such an important issue from me, his sworn brother? First of all, in this yakuza society of ours, you never swear loyalty to two bosses at the sometime. What does he think a loyalty oath is? He's a yakuza, but he's also a businessman. Please forgive his rudeness. I apologize on his behalf. Excuse me. Hello, Mom. Is it okay for you not to be working? I'm here with my boss. He's talking with someone in that shop. American cigarettes. Thank you. Give these to your friends. Takeshi, take care of yourself. Sure, sure. What do you want? Tell me. Well, as a matter of fact, the boss has finally decided to retire. Yeah? I suppose it's about time. We talked with the boss last night, and we're gonna ask Yamamori to be his successor. What do you think? Yamamori? That's not a good idea. Make a man like that boss and you're sure to regret it later. Why don?t you ask Uchimoto? Between you and me, the boss is angry with Uchimoto because he became a sworn brother with an Akashi man. The boss thinks he sold out Hiroshima to Kobe. I helped Uchimoto in that deal, so I can say nothing. Why don?t you guys figure it out? Look. We don?t want a fuss over this. We'd just like you to talk to the men. If not Uchimoto, why don?t you choose someone from the Muraoka family? Why not you? Eda did all that time in the joint, so I can't very well step up. Then how about Eda? He?s too much of a ladies' man, and the boss doesn't agree. How about you? I've got health problems, plus I don't have the kind of record a leader needs. We won't accept Yamamori as boss forever. Eventually, one of us will take over, maybe even you. But for now, we thought it'd work better if Yamamori took the post for a year or so. What? What are the three of you talking about? Hello. Hirono. You opened your big mouth to Aihara. What do you mean? You said I'd sworn loyalty to Muraoka as boss. Yes, I did. Idiot! Damn you! You should have said you knew nothing. But it?s true. I don't know how to say anything but the truth. You had to shoot off your trap, and now Aihara's pissed. The ceremony with Mr. Akashi is put off indefinitely. How will you restore the face I lost? You know, bro, you really shouldn't be selling yourself cheap - here, there, and everywhere. - What?re you talking about? Getting in with Mr. Akashi will raise my prestige. Then I can sell myself higher. If you?ve ruined my chance to get ahead, you're gonna answer for it. Why should I? If you want prestige, then you should make things right for the late Sugihara. That's how you earn prestige in yakuza society. I'm not interested in your hick opinions. Keep your nose out of my business next time! Fine! I won't say a word even if you ask me! Should we have told him? He told me to butt out, didn't he? Fuck him. He's turned out to be a real disappointment. I'll try talking to Mr. Yamamori. Better the devil you know than the angel you don't. Two months later, the Muraoka family in Hiroshima and the Yamamori family in Kure joined forces, and Yamamori became the boss of the newly combined family, with 200 members. CHAI RMAN OF THE TOYODA FAMI LY RYOHEl TOYODA Hello, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for coming. - Makihara. - Hi! BOSS OF HAMAZAKI FAMILY IN IWAKUNI SHIRO HAMAZAKI Congratulations! I heard you've been having trouble with Komori in Iwakuni. Don?t worry. We're taking care of it. Really? That's good. This way, please. Hirono. You scheming asshole. - Boss! - It's okay. I was born to be a boss. I'm a lucky man. Now that I control Hiroshima, we're not gonna have outsiders meddling in our business. That's fine, but you don?t want to make too many enemies, either. Yes. By the way, your family?s growing too. Yes, thank you. We have an excellent boss, and our young men work hard forth family. That's right. Without good men at his side, a boss can't do much. In our family, this Takeda is the best, and has about 60 million yen. This guy here is next, with about40 million yen. Eda here just got out of prison, so next would be this guy, who's got 30 million - no, more like 27 million. The others are about the same. And how much do you have, boss? Me? I have your two favorite golden balls. The guest over there is asking for you. Bro, that's Komori. The one we?ve had trouble with. Okay, keep quiet. You asked for me? You and that Hamazaki are sworn brothers, right? What about it? There's been some friction between Hamazaki and Komori here in Iwakuni. Since Komori is my sworn brother, I'm planning to mediate, and I don't want you meddling. I'm not so old yet that I need your help. So long as they can settle things without trouble. What?s this, Mr. Uchimoto? When did you get here? Why not come seethe boss and our guests from Kobe? You come too. Very well. I'm sorry. I had another guest to see to. Do you have a more important guest in Hiroshima than me? He has no common sense, you see? That's why Mr. Muraoka gave up on him. Now, now. Let's all be friends. Did you hear what Mr. Aihara said, Uchimoto? Why don?t you come work for me? If you?re asking me to swear loyalty as an under boss to you, I refuse. I regard Mr. Akashi as my boss. Who said anything about that? All I'm saying is I'll take you on if you want to be one of my water carriers. Do you believe this guy? Have you ever seen such an idiot? He's so devoted to Mr. Akashi, he bows toward Kobe from morning till night. But fool that he is, I do hope you?ll take good care of him. Are you crying? Come now, don't cry. Here, drink up. Go on. I think we?ll be excusing ourselves. Wait. Uchimoto, why don?t you invite us all to your bar? My wife has a bar. Please stop by there first. Very well. You come too. Stay with Uchimoto. Listen. He's got the Kobe people with him. Just grit your teeth and come along. Leave me alone! I'm not drinking with a black-hearted schemer like you. What?re you talking about? You keep calling me a schemer. What did I do? Don?t you understand? No, tell me. Fine, I'll tell you. You knew Muraoka would retire, but you kept mum to me while you kissed Yamamori's ass. It was Mr. Muraoka's decision. I didn't know a thing about it. Besides, you told me to butt out. Remember? Even if l?d supported you, you were claiming you didn't owe loyalty to Muraoka then. If you aren't loyal to him now, what qualifies you to be his successor? You just wait! I'm gonna smash Yamamori eventually, and you'll be first on my list for payback! Why wait? You wanna kill me, kill me now! Hirono, stop it. You don't need an appointment. Come for me anytime you like. I'll be waiting. Bro. A few days later, Uchimoto's vehement rancor against Yamamori SEPTEMBER 1962 - IWAKUNI BASE BAR DISTRICT IN YAMAGUCHI led to the outbreak of the proxy war between the Komori and Hamazaki families in Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture. This struggle naturally aggravated the Yamamori family in Hiroshima. Boss, we're all here now. Where's Takeda? He's in the hospital with his chronic problems. I called you here for a word about the fight between Hamazaki and Komori. Regard that fight as our own. Hamazaki is a sworn brother to Makihara, so we?ll destroy Komori and squash that piece of shit Uchimoto. He fancies himself a mediator, but he's entirely on Komori's side. First of all, for tomorrow's funeral, send a detachment of trucks loaded with men from each of your families. Makihara, you're in charge. That's all. Dismissed. Hold on a second. Our two families have only recently merged. We need more time to consolidate our strength. Komori has ties to the Toyoda family, and Uchimoto is supported by Kobe. Do you seriously want to pick this fight? This is great. I've never had one of my water carriers offer me advice before. And a fine one he is! I guess that shuts me up. If you don't want to do it, fine. I'll do it by myself. I've suffered Uchimoto's insults long enough. And for the sake of all the young men from the Muraoka family, too, there comes a time when you have to make a stand. Can?t you see how I feel? Don't cry, darling! You mustn't. Not in front of all these people. You had to open your big mouth. Now apologize! I was out of line. I'll listen to others from now on. Please forgive me. All right, then. So long as you understand. I'll remain in overall command, so come talk to me anytime. I've got a lot of experience under my belt. Now let's go eat! Come on. I'll get the trucks. You prepare the troops. What a crock! Today's tears certainly weren?t one of his better performances. What do you mean? He'll cry on you every time. The boss wants to see Makihara become a man so he can put the screws on the rest of us. That's why he's pushing this stupid fight on us. It's fucking bullshit, man! Hi, bro! Thanks for coming all this way. We'll support you. You hold your ground. We'll go to Komori right now! Let's go! Hold on. What?s your plan when you get there? We'll crush him! Who's "we"? We're not joining you. Uchimoto is our sworn brother. We can?t fight him. What can I do on my own? One leader is enough, no? If you?re killed, we'll see you?re buried with honor. Please go crush them. Then I'm not going either! Bro! If the leader calls it off, then no need for us to go. Let's go back to Hiroshima. Hey, Hirono! Please wait! Please! They talked big but didn?t take any action. I knew from the start I couldn't trust them. Let's change the plan. What are you going to do? Don?t you know why I come here so often? Boss. Are you going to fight the Uchimoto family? You needn't worry. My husband Hayakawa isn't so loyal to Uchimoto. He oversees the younger members only because he was asked to. He always says you're the only boss in Hiroshima. I knew it. Makihara here was going to kill your husband, but I stopped him. I've never killed a man. I'm such a kind little poppa. Boss! Hey, Hayakawa, come join us. Mr. Yamamori has something to tell you. He's waiting. Listen to him carefully. Hurry up. Hello there. He's going to take Hayakawa over to his side? He oversees most of the young men in the Uchimoto family. Our boss said if we get him on our side, the Uchimoto family will lose without so much as a fight. Then what's Hayakawa going to do? He'll leave it to us. That's ridiculous! Think about it. We say we don't want to fight, but we steal Uchimoto's young men then turn and crush him? We'll be the laughingstock of the yakuza world. Hayakawa's an idiot. The moment he's unhappy with one boss, he looks for another. I don't like a guy who's always working the odds. If you take him in, I leave the family for sure. Well, let me tell you all something. Our boss says you refuse to take action 'cause your Uchimoto's sworn brothers. We can't trust you! That's why we?re gonna take Hayakawa in. It's not about whether we take action. This is your sworn brother's fight, so you can go crush Uchimoto by yourself. This isn't my fight! This fight is between Hirono and Uchimoto. Every time something happens, you lay it at my door! If that?s how you feel, I'll sever ties with Uchimoto and confront him. But just don't be sneaking away later when the Akashi family confronts you. Hey, cool down! If you?re gonna go after Uchimoto, we have to be ready too. What are you guys doing? - What is it? - A bomb! It's a smoke bomb! Hey, watch out! Relax! It says "smoke bomb." Fools! Those punks scared us. Those jerks work for that damned Uchimoto! How would I know? I can?t take responsibility for what a couple meatheads do. Besides, no one was hurt. I see. Moving on to another matter, Mr. Uchimoto... I've been in your good graces, but you should treat me like a stranger from today on. We're all returning these, including Takeda. Well, we'll be going now. Can we get a few more bets? We're ready. - Ready here too. - Game! Three. No, don't get up. What do you want? My boss cut off his finger. I was asked to deliver it to you. Shit! That moron! A finger or two isn't enough. If he asks for his life, tell him he has to come in person. But he's been missing since this morning. He was tired and ran off to Kobe, leaving his men here. Really pisses me off! What kind of boss runs away and leave his men? I'm gonna sever ties with him. You heard him, boss. Please help him out. Now that Uchimoto's run off, why not take charge and disband the Uchimoto family and join ours? That's one idea... Boss Yamamori... would you support me if I became boss of the Uchimoto family? I'll kill Komori. I promise. Hayakawa. Are you a man or a mouse? Henchmen should fight even when their boss isn?t there. If you?re so eager to be on our side, you have to kill Uchimoto first. Isn?t that how it works? You shut up! Don't waste your time with this guy! If this reaches Kobe's ears, you know what?ll happen. Yes, that's right. I see. Who was that? The Akashi family. They have something to ask us about Uchimoto. Aihara and Miyaji will be coming here soon. Don't look at me! You?re the ones who severed ties with Uchimoto. You deal with Akashi. It's too late. We have to fight Akashi, right? I'll start making preparations. Me too. I'll be getting back too. Boss. Listen. Keep a watch out. Hello. Yes. Boss, Mrs. Yamamori wants to speak to you. Hello? Yes, it's me. Shozo, you must come over, and hurry! There are some men in front of our house, and they're speaking in Kobe dialect. I'm sure they've come from the Akashi family to kill my husband. Please come quickly! I'll be there as soon as possible. Get your weapons and follow me. Mrs. Yamamori! Shozo? Yes, it's me. Shozo, thanks for coming. It's all right. It was just some drunken sailors kickin' up a fuss. Really? I was so scared. I called Makihara and some others. They said they'd come, but no one did. You're the only one I can count on, Shozo. Don?t worry anymore. I'll leave a few of my men with you. Shozo, will you put your life on the line for my husband? He says he can?t trust anyone these days. He doesn't sleep well, and his appetite's been poor. What's wrong? Just when I was sound asleep! Dear, Shozo said he'll risk his life for you, so you can get a good night's sleep and stop worrying. Who said I couldn't sleep? I was just angry with that damned Hayakawa and had some thinking to do. What about Hayakawa? I'm really angry with him. That idiot went to see Uchimoto in Kobe because he heard that the Akashi family supported Uchimoto. That traitor! Next time I see him, I'll slice him in two! The battle hadn't yet flared at that point, but a few days later, the under bosses of the Akashi family asked to see Hirono secretly. I'm sorry for the short notice. I wanted to speak with you frankly. About what? Are you going to oppose us or support us? Which will it be? With an attitude like that, what am I supposed to say? If you oppose me, I'll oppose you. Now, now, let's talk calmly. We all know each other here. Listen, Hirono. Could you make peace with Uchimoto? Make peace? As forth fight between Komori and Hamazaki, we went to see Mr. Toyoda in Yamaguchi and persuaded them to reconcile, with Uchimoto acting as go-between. But for that, if you don't reconcile with Uchimoto, it makes us look bad. I see. I can't make that decision on my own. I'll discuss it with my men. Frankly speaking, at this point you?re the only one opposing us in Hiroshima. Makihara came to a Buddhist service yesterday in Mr. Yamamori's place. He said some of Yamamori's men are acting like renegades and causing Yamamori trouble in waging this battle. And as for Makihara, he begged to join us, the Akashi family, and promised to quit the Yamamori family at anytime. Eda called me and explained that he's not going to oppose us. And I heard Matsunaga is off having fun in Shikoku. None of them are gonna fight. You?re the only one. You could have wound up fighting Yamamori, Uchimoto and the others on your own, only to lose in the end. Boss, it's time. I received word from Mr. Toyoda in Yamaguchi that Hamazaki is to be reconciled with Komori, with Uchimoto as mediator. You guys should attend. How did you arrange it with the Akashi family? Well, I went to Kobe and we agreed that we, the Yamamori family, will have nothing to do with the Hamazaki family. That would be handing Uchimoto a victory. That's only a matter for Uchimoto's sworn brothers. The Yamamori family doesn?t win or lose one way or the other. I can't listen to this bullshit anymore. So you just swallowed the Akashi family's deal hook, line and sinker? Who says I did? Right in front of the Akashi under bosses, I said that our boss is the best in Japan. Makihara. What exactly took you to Kobe? Some business for the boss. What kind of business, boss? Well, I was told there was a Buddhist service. You make us oppose them alone but you reconcile with them by yourself? Hurry up! The boss is having trouble with some young renegades. Is that what you said? Just who?s a renegade here? Did you say that? No, I didn't. I heard from Aihara and Miyaji that you begged to join them and promised to leave us at any moment. I heard there's some other shady dealings going on too. If you want to save your lives, you'd better reconcile with Uchimoto and get out. That?s the only honest thing to do. I want no part of this fight! Come now, you guys work it out. The reconciliation ceremony for Komori and Hamazaki was held at a restaurant in Yamaguchi soon thereafter. At the ceremony, Hirono and others apologized to Uchimoto and went through the motions of making peace. Forgive me if I insist on formalities. You missed out on being named successor. But I was named captain. I hope I'll continue in your favor. This ceremony was a de facto defeat for the Yamamori family. And that autumn, the ambitious Uchimoto became the 61stsworn brother of Tatsuo Akashi, boss of the Akashi family, signaling his clear opposition to the Yamamori family. At the end of the year, Yamamori secretly visited under boss Akira Takeda in the hospital. That damned Uchimoto won't even say hello to me on the street. The way he struts around! One of the young men told me. This is all Hirono's fault. He always upends my well-laid plans. He's much more Akashi's pawn than Uchimoto's. I can't relax until he's forced out of Hiroshima. He seldom visits us. Takeda, I'm going to revive the post of captain of the younger ranks, which was abolished in the merger. It'll help control the family. Would you take on that role? It?s too much for me. No, you're the only man for the job. Matsunaga always sides with Hirono, Eda won't lift a finger, and Makihara doesn't have the guts. You're the only one who can stand up to Hirono. I'm begging you. You have to help me! You see how desperate he is, that he even comes to you on your sickbed? You needn't beg. I understand. Really? Will you do it? But if I take the position, I have my pride to uphold. I must do it my way. Of course, whatever you like. I'm thinking of naming you successor anyway. Getting right to business, someone brought a proposal to form an alliance with the Shinwa Group in Kobe. It seems a good chance to defeat Uchimoto and put some spine in our family. That?s well and good, but is the Shinwa Group powerful? No one can face the Akashi family on equal footing except the Shinwa Group. JANUARY 1963 -NEWYEAR'S MEETING OF YAMAMORI FAMILY UNDERBOSSES Please continue your favors this year again. As I said before, Takeda has recovered and will now lead you as captain. Please give him your support. I appreciate your support. Getting right to business, we're going to form an alliance with the Shinwa Group of Kobe. I'll fill you in on the details later. I hope for your cooperation. So that's that. Happy New Year. Please continue your favors toward us. Beer. Listen... I'd like to ask Mr. Toyoda of Yamaguchi to serve as go-between in order to form an alliance with the Shinwa Group. But I don't know him. Would you go with me? - I can't support this plan. - Why not? If our family forms an alliance in its current sad state, it'll only mean trouble for the Shinwa Group and Mr. Toyoda in the future. Don't say that. I intend to whip this family into shape. Just how are you going to do that? You speak of an alliance with the Shinwa Group, but look over there. Who do you think those women are? They're all from Hayakawa's bar. Our boss is trying to use Makihara to lure Hayakawa over to us, and Hayakawa's all ears because the Akashi family doesn?t treat him well. Hey, Matsunaga! Watch it! If the captain says we're gonna do it, cooperate with him. If you guys say so, it's okay by me. But it'll get me in trouble with the Akashi family, so I'll have to see how I feel then. I see. There's nothing I can do about that. But until the situation becomes clear, don't meet with the men of the Akashi family. Why not? The boss acts freely. Why should my hands be tied? Since he won?t take a clear stand one way or another, I have to find safe ground myself. Then why not just let the Akashi family take you under their wing? Hey! You're brown-nosing Takeda 'cause you hope to succeed him. We don't have it so easy. Listen here! When did I say anything about being successor? Stop it! Back off! Good evening. Happy New Year. You ladies are lovely. Die! What are you doing with that? The safety's still on. Boss, who was that punk? I've got a pretty good idea. Are you a sworn brother of the boss? Not yet. You should be soon. Just have to show your devotion. Yes, I see. How about you and me working together? Working together? The boss was just attacked. That was Makihara's doing. The boss doesn't want to cause Mrs. Yamamori grief by striking back. Why don?t we get him? Let's prove we're men and earn some points. All right, bro, I'm with you! I have a little problem with my hand... but I can take you to Makihara. Why don?t you do it? - You're hurting me! - Come on, hurry up! He's in that room. Go on. No, I won't. I can't pull this off without your help. He doesn't know about us. Just pretend you know nothing. It's a one-time thing. Hurry up! Keep it to 30 minutes, eh? Good evening. Good evening. Aren?t you going to hold me? It's cold. Let's get it over with. The light. Your pants. That hurts! Watch it! No! That's enough! You don't listen! The boss wants to talk to you. Will you meet with him? Fine with me, but I heard Hirono's squawking. Don?t mind him. He'll be out of the picture soon. While you were gone, he tried to force me to disband our family. Hirono did that? I was right there. That bastard! I'll give him a taste of my mind! Makihara! Congratulations on your release from prison. I'm only out on bail. I've still got the trial coming up. What a drag. By the way, is it true that the Yamamori family is going to form an alliance with the Shinwa Group? Takeda and the boss say so, so it'll probably happen. Can?t we stop them? I can't do it by myself. I've been on the outs with the family recently. In that case, would you consider being reconciled with Uchimoto? That way, the Akashi family could make inroads in Hiroshima. I'm not sure... Hirono, this is a moment of truth for you. If Yamamori forms an alliance with the Shinwa Group, you'll be a thorn in their side 'cause you?re close with us. I heard Yamamori tried to kill you. How about this? What about you driving Yamamori into retirement and taking control of Hiroshima? We'll support you. The truth is... we let Uchimoto hold our flag, but we?re not really counting on him. Iwai... I'm happy here in Kure. No one gets a bed of roses in yakuza society. It's a dog-eat-dog world. Am I wrong? I see. But how can I betray my boss? How do you expect to drive him out if you don't? You just gonna sit there and do nothing? Anyway, would you mention Uchimoto to Takeda and the others? There's no turning back now. I'm counting on you. Hello. Yes, it's me. Yes, he's here. What? Boss! Goddamn you! Fucking idiot! Damn you! Who the fuck told you to do that? He said he acted on his own. Shithead! You want to bring down our whole family single-handedly? Don?t you know my situation? Boss, give me another chance. I'll kill him next time. You fucking idiot! You got shit for brains or what? Shithead! Get up! Boss! - Please stop! - Let the fuck go of me! You'll kill him, boss! Then let the bastard die! How is he? The fever's gone down. It's okay. Don't get up. Wiping out your rivals doesn't mean you win the game these days. Just get that through your head and I'll be happy. Boss, Mr. Takeda wants you on the phone. Takeda? I heard you met with Iwai from the Akashi family. What did he have to say? You got a network of spies or what? He didn't say anything in particular. He's out on bail from kyushu and dropped by to say hello. Is that all? All right. Listen, Takeda. I've given it some thought. I agree to the alliance with the Shinwa Group. I'll go see Mr. Toyoda with you. You will? That'll be a big help. Please do that. See you tomorrow. Boss, if you help them do this, how will the Akashi family react? I'm gonna drive Yamamori out. Mark my words. That June, the Yamamori family and the Shinwa Group from Kobe formed an alliance of equals, with Toyoda as mediator. One week later, the Akashi family formed an alliance with the Kojima family, the biggest yakuza gang in Okayama, revealing their confrontational stance. Moreover, Akashi under bosses were sent to Hiroshima shortly thereafter to try and pressure Yamamori family under bosses to be reconciled with Uchimoto. Hirono. I heard you knew about Iwai's proposal that we reconcile with Uchimoto. Why didn?t you mention that? What difference would it have made? You were busy with the alliance with the Shinwa Group. I see. In any event, we can't be reconciled with Uchimoto. Will you go tell them that? If you tell me to, I will. The rest of you okay with that? It's too late to listen to the Akashi family! They're trying to cripple our alliance with the Shinwa Group. What are you gonna do? I'll convey your decisions, but I myself may not be able to refuse. I'll think it over there at that time. You can't be so selfish. I can't permit it as captain. Then why don?t you all go and refuse together? Then I'll go with what you decide. But if we go to refuse their offer, you should know that it may come to blows on the spot. Welcome. Come in, please. Thanks for coming all this way. Though I asked my colleagues' opinions, they refuse to be reconciled with Mr. Uchimoto. What happened? It's a blackout. I'll get some light. Make it snappy! I'm sorry it took so long. Here you are. We'll speak our piece first. This all started with the conflict between Komori and Hamazaki. You severed your ties with Uchimoto because of that. In response, Mr. Uchimoto cut off his finger, yet even then you have not been reconciled to him. Why not? If you won't be, we can't keep the peace. What do you think? We already apologized once to Uchimoto, so we thought that was already settled. Yes, you made up for that, But the fact Mr. Uchimoto cut off his finger hasn't been addressed. You need to be reconciled and become sworn brothers again. That's the yakuza way. Given our situation, that's the one thing we cannot do. Well, then... our ties will be completely severed. Matsunaga, you sure that's what you want? I didn't exactly say I refused. I was just following my boss and captain. Mr. Eda, what do you think? Well... I haven't really given it much thought. Well, it seems the captain's the only one who opposes it. Mr. Takeda, are you feeling bad because of the Shinwa Group? As a matter of fact, I often speak with the Shinwa Group in Kobe. They made it quite clear their alliance with Mr. Yamamori was little more than a business matter. In other words should you really need their help, they won?t be easily moved to action. If you?d like, I'll call Mr. Itami of the Shinwa Group to confirm. You needn't do that. I understand what you?re saying. The blackout came at an awfully inconvenient time! Mr. Okubo. You young men are always up to something! So, did you come to a decision? Thank you for joining us. Mr. Takeda, we had asked Mr. Okubo to come act as go-between, assuming you would bewailing reconcile. With Mr. Okubo's participation, Mr. Yamamori is sure to say yes. We can accept your decision, but if you cause Mr. Okubo to lose face, you'll lose standing in Hiroshima. Sir, I leave it entirely up to you. Well, then, in that case, I'll be happy to help you. We're in your hands. Allow me to say something! I'll be reconciled with the others, but not with Hirono! Are you still harping on that? That's enough now. I'm no one's puppet! I don't do things halfway! Besides, I know Hirono caused trouble for Hayakawa! I refuse! Come now. We'll discuss this some other time. Our business here is finished. Let's go someplace a bit brighter and have some fun. Okay, Mr. Okubo? Yeah, it's gloomy in here. Let's go flirt with the ladies. Let's go. No, I'm not going. I'm staying here. Leave me alone. He tried to- Inviting Mr. Okubo was your doing, wasn't it? There's no way the Akashi family could have known him. You knew what was going to happen, yet you brought us here anyway. That's why you cooperated to form the alliance with the Shinwa Group. Believe that if you like. I see I can't win. Wait. Takeda... I'm not trying to put you in a bind. I'm going after Yamamori. Hiroshima can never be united while he's at the top. So... I'm going to drag him into the struggle between Akashi and Shinwa, leading him to irreparable shame and forcing him to retire. Why don?t you be Yamamori's successor when he retires? Then I'll support you wholeheartedly. If we?re gonna be burned by the sparks, Let Yamamori roast in the flames. The Akashi family, who sought to penetrate Hiroshima by means of Uchimoto's resurgence, convinced Uchimoto to expel the dissenting Hayakawa and then enacted a reconciliation, as planned. On the other side, when the Shinwa Group heard the news, they sent vice chairman Itami to call Yamamori to account. Everything transpired just as Hirono expected, and Yamamori was backed into a corner. However, after Toyoda was brought in as mediator, the state of affairs took an unexpected turn. Takeda has come with the decision of the Yamamori family and the Shinwa Group. They request you retire and give up this life. Give up this life? Yes, the Shinwa Group agreed on that condition. They're resolving this by sacrificing you. You say it's been decided. But if I refuse, what will they do? That?s why I told them Hirono's not about to give up this life. Then they handed me this. LETTER OF EXPULSION You have to make up your mind. This guy says he'll support you. Listen, bro. I agree with Mr. Okubo. You're close with the Akashi family. If we join forces, we could take Kure easily. It's about time we show that bastard Yamamori! Everything went just as you planned. Dragging Mr. Okubo into it was a nice touch. You dragged him into this first. It serves you right. I was wrong to trust you. The family can only work if we?re united. Only thing a guy like you can do is get out. Serves you right! Don't like it? Then put up a fight! I just might do that. Bring Yamamori along and challenge me anytime! Prepare to die! Move! I'm gonna kill you! That bastard! Aren?t you gonna do anything? Go on! Get him! Leave it to me. I'll kill him. Matsunaga, I hear you're real tight with Hirono. Whose side are you gonna take? Whose side? I have no grudge against either side. I'll be neutral. I don't allow neutral around here. If you don't side with us, you have to retire and never come back here again. Tokyo? Why? It's better than dying in the fight. Would you run away with me? No. Where you gonna get the cash anyway? You won't come 'cause I have no money? I'd never go with you. I'm with Kuramoto now. You - What is it, sir? Take this. You'll need it. Hirono was expelled because of you, so you have to sever ties with those guys from the Yamamori family. Please see to it right away. Why should I be involved in the struggle between Yamamori and Hirono? If you don't get involved, we can't help Hirono. It's a direct order from the boss in Kobe too. Which side? What do you mean by that? TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP We're gonna fight Uchimoto and Hirono. If you fight for us, you can join our family. What do you say? I'd be happy to join you. Very well. Then let us see some proof of your commitment. Darling. Get ready! AUGUST 26, 1963 -ATTHE AKASHI FAMILY'S UCHIMOTO BRANCH Shoot! Kill! The police! Bro! HAYAKAWA, YAMAMORI'S ALLY, ATTACKED THE UCHIMOTO FAMILY, AKASHI'S ALLY THE HIROSHIMA BATTLE BEGAN What? I see! It finally happened! That bastard Hayakawa attacked the Uchimoto office. Really? All right, then. We'll crush him! Tell the office to begin preparations. Boss, Mr. Makihara is watching a movie at the Chuo Theater. I see. Good work. The Chuo Theater. Here it is. Oh, it's me. What's the rush? One of Hirono's men is on his way. Keep an eye out. I'm leaving for Tokyo now! Get in! The police cut him up. They took out everything inside and sewed him up again like a sack. Where are his insides? There, there. Takeshi! Boss! It's hot! When a battle begins, young men are always the first to lose their lives, yet their deaths have never once been honored. Fatalities keep piling up as the battle among the yakuza of Hiroshima escalates into an ever more violent struggle. THE END
