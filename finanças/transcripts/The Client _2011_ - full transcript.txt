Produced by KIM Jho-Kwang-soo SHIN Chang-kil HA Jung-woo PARK Hee-soon JANG Hyuk Directed by SOHN Young-Sung HAN Cheol-min? HAN Cheol-min, right? It's him. You're under arrest for the murder of your wife. You have right to remain silent and hire a lawyer. Let's go. Come on. Watch your head. The Client Between midnight and 1 a.m. On December 9th 2010 HAN Cheol-min killed his wife at home. Using his silver SUV he dumped the body somewhere unknown. Around 5 a.m. He came back to the scene. The police apprehended him red-handed. HAN was suspicious of his wife's infidelity. She asked for a divorce 4 days earlier. And that gave him motive. HAN is denying his crime. But the prosecution says they have enough evidence to support his charge. Wow. What's your cut? It's 5:5, as always. You're kidding me. Will you take HAN's case, or not? Not interested. He's insisting on you to represent him. Did you know him? No. Why bother with a case you can't win? I understand. There isn't even a body. This kind of case has two precedents. Did it happen inside? Or outside? For the former, without hard evidence it's all circumstantial and you have no case. The suspect walks. Even if the body turns up later double jeopardy is prohibited. What about the latter? If the killer is human, there's always evidence. Then it's easier to put the story together. Mostly guilty. The prosecution says he planned it. If it's true, 18 years at least. Any possibility HAN might confess? I know. That would knock some years off. You know what he needs? Pro bono. Wait, KANG. Okay. Let's make it 6:4. What are you, his agent? Fine. It's 7:3. That is KANG! She's out! Calm down, guys. Be careful. I'll take questions. Why do you keep quiet about a sex video? That's not the issue here. This is a libel suit. Her agent scarred the life of an innocent actress. Ouch! Don't step on my foot. Is there a sex video? That's not important. Watch it, guys. - What's the truth? - I will tell you. It's the prosecution's job to uncover the truth. Everything about the case is on my website. I've watched the video! It's WWW - Move it! - Hold on. Come on, guys. What a clown. This jerk is AHN's friend? Get out of here, PARK. Sir. That PARK is a fucking joke. This kid is representing HAN Cheol-min? Not decided yet. Why does he keep fucking with us? Shit. When he was with us, he was good. Better than you? Why did he quit? He took on a murder case of this Vietnamese girl. And he was accused of using violence. Soon he quit. Now he's running a circus. I'm late for a rehearsal. They will be mad. God, I have bags under my eyes. My head hurts. I drank too much last night. You sure did. Will they appeal? Never. - Hurry, I'm showering. - I'm done. Hello? HAN fucked up. What? He tried to kill himself. - Why? - You don't know? I would at least meet him. You're a bad lawyer! God, it's cold. What took you so long? When'd you get here? A while ago. Let's go. I've seen enough. You wore that suit yesterday. I know. So what? What do you care? You're so nosy. He kills his wife and dumps the body. And he comes back with a gift to the scene crowded by cops? It was their anniversary. He's a total psycho. Let's take the stairs. Married for 3 years. No kids. He works at a film developer's. When the cops got here they saw nothing but a blood bed. A DNA test confirms it's wife's blood. She's dead for sure. No signs of forced entry. Any evidence? Nothing. The body is gone. So is the murder weapon. Everything is circumstantial. So it's a puzzle without pieces. Is this CCTV on the evidence list? No. Hi. I'm investing HAN's case. Did the cops take CCTV footage? They did. It's stored in file, right? Sure. You still have it? We delete everything past a month. All right. Thanks. This might be fun. There's an eye witness. Isn't HAN strange? I don't know. Here's what makes the case so complicated. No fingerprints or DNA of his found in his apartment. Does it make sense? Not a single hair of his in his own place? Right. And here's the shocker. He has no fingerprints. All 10 of them. Your hand. Let me. Okay. Your wife had a lover? Yes. How did you know? I've seen her on the phone with him. And my gut feelings. Is that what you said to the police? Yes. You know the guy? No. Why is that missing in the police report? Sir? Do you believe me? Pretty much. I believe everybody. Mr. HAN. People often ask me that. It doesn't matter whether I do or not. I will just focus on getting what we want. It won't be easy without his confession. Cause AHN is on this? What about him? He's a hard nut to crack. I couldn't care less. Out. In. Out. In! What are you, a blind? Fine. His wife had a lover, but it's not in the report. If it's true, her lover is a key suspect. We should utilize this. Let's try to make a deal with it. Would he confess? I will talk him into it if it looks good. If he killed on impulse without intent? We'll go for manslaughter. That will take a lot of years off. Prosecutor AHN? It's been a while. (Less than 5 years) Good. How's life treating you? A plea bargain? Listen to yourself. Sounds like you're desperate. We don't need his confession. What about her lover? She didn't have one. Checked the phone record? There's no one. Yeah? That's the truth. I will request a discovery. That won't happen. This is a homicide without the body. No way I can't give you what we have. Okay. I'll keep this. Don't take this case. You will regret it later. You don't wanna make it a habit to mess up. It's a gift. I will have him out on lack of evidence. Hi, Professor. - How are you? - Good. Homicide without a body? Right. Let's talk over lunch. More coffee? No, thanks. I'm leaving. Professor AHN will be here soon. My father? I will see him at home. You'll take the case? Why don't you get a second thought? It's weird. They won't tell us which judge will preside. It is weird. The victim's lover. A missing living room light. Why isn't CCTV on the evidence list? Get me that CCTV file. I'm sure it has been already deleted. Then get me evidence that it's been deleted. KANG? HAN's trial is set to begin in 3 days. Seems like they've already found him guilty. Good morning! Come to my office. Nobody's giving us answers. We have to find them. Here, coffee and donuts. Do you know what bothers me the most? Everything took place too quickly as if the police saw it coming. The police arrived at 1:30 a.m. HAN was arrested at 5 a.m. Isn't it strange? No physical evidence. Everything is circumstantial. Within that short period of time they were able to build a case. Doesn't it smell? Detective LEE? Why isn't CCTV on the evidence list? Who took the living room light? Check with that cop who was at the scene. I bet his story has loose ends. Check witnesses as well. The guy from downstairs. He says he saw HAN that night. He might be lying. Okay. I got it. The victim's mother. She claims her daughter came 3 days prior to murder and told her that HAN would kill her. She's said to hate HAN. So, see if her story sticks. You handle the detective and the mother-in-law. I'll check the witness's alibi. Time is not on our side. Let's get to work. Judge LEE? What is this? I can't be seen with you. Come on, it's okay. On the night of murder HAN took a highway, not a turnpike. He said he was so tired and missed it. Then he hit a guardrail and passed out. He was arrested at 5. So he was out for over 3 hours. We need to check that out. Look here. This is the highway he took. Don't touch it. It couldn't be better if you find a witness. If not, find a crash site to prove his alibi. Any questions? I have one. The trial begins in 3 days. And you expect me to do all that in 3 days? It will be postponed. What? It will. Got it. HAN's attorney hasn't contacted you, right? I can't believe this. Didn't my boss call you? Yourjob evaluation is next month. Watch it. You can't blackmail me. Get HAN out of the way. I'm concerned about your promotion. Judge LEE Jin-wook The defendant was late to appoint his attorney. So he requests a postponement? I won't allow it. HAN has requested a jury trial. Hot! The trial has been postponed. Shit. It takes at least 2 weeks to pick jurors. Good luck. Ajury trial? Okay. Once the trial begins, there'll be a lot of hassles. I will call you as the date is set. Okay. I will be waiting. Then Mr. Prosecutor? My daughter would feel the same as I do. You're doing the right thing. Don't feel guilty. You have to win this case for my little girl. So HAN left around 10 p.m.? Yes, 10 o'clock. That's about right. Was he acting weird that day? Or said anything strange? I don't know. Nothing unusual. A key to the prop room? He was in a hurry, though. Now that I think about it. No. Mt. Chunma, Chungpyong, Namisum, Gapyong, Chuncheon. Why can't he remember where he crashed? Wait! Hold on! What? A dummy that we use for a dead body was missing. Hi. That witness from downstairs. He's not home. I haven't seen him for a while. He must be out of town. Any idea when he'll be back? We don't talk much. Why'd you leave your office for so long that night? God, it was a nightmare. I had to go to the park lot by the next building. It was a mess. What time was it? Not quite sure. It was before midnight. You don't know who it was? All I saw was a dark figure. Which company handles your CCTVs? A detective in charge took it. LEE something. Are you sure? Let me check. I kept the record. Hold on. Yes, it was him. It was 1:30 a.m. No, a little before 1:30. The police arrived at 1:30. And he came before that? Right. Why would I lie? Hello? Detective LEE took it. Everything from a month earlier. If he doesn't have it, the prosecution does. Check that out. Hello? Hello? Shit, I can't believe him. Excuse me? Detective LEE Byung-guk is with you guys, right? Beats me. Ask someone else. Wait. Thanks for no help! So it was a dummy? Not a body? Yeah. What time was it? Let me see. Want one? I would say around 11. Run the plate. Nothing. Yeah? 38 NA 6609, pull over. Pull over now. - How are you? - What? You were going awfully fast. Step out of the vehicle. It's just routine. Let go! What is this? Cuff him and call for backup. Okay. Wait. What's this? Calm down, pal. The vehicle wasn't registered? Right. You guys look good in this one. I popped the question on this day. Were you mad to learn she was cheating? Do I have to testify in court? No, that won't do us any good. You will take the fifth. Won't the jury be suspicious? I don't know. I will do whatever you say. What's that? They're the same candles as the ones found at the scene. For one, all the way. For the other, down to the line here. Time how long it takes and let me know. What's this for? Time difference. What? Only one didn't burn all the way down. Somebody lit it afterwards. Who did? HAN Cheol-min. This will prove the fact he was home. I don't know. I thought it was the wife. But it could be somebody else. - Sir! - Get out of here! Come on, listen to me. I simply asked you about an accident here two months ago. Why are you so mad? What accident? I don't know anything. Wait, wait. If you remember anything Or if you hear of any, I'll leave my card here. Call me if you remember anything. Thanks! Damn. Hi, kid. You live around here? You're limping. You hurt your leg? Kid? Hey! He could've talked instead of rubbing himself. It'll be hard to find a witness or an accident site. What are you doing? Are you in the shower? Yeah. Here's what I found out. A prop dummy? Can't ID the driver? I'm sure CCTV got the killer. That detective took it from a month earlier even before they got to the scene. Maybe the wife's lover? You think her lover did it? It's a possibility. Not sure yet. It's okay if that detective acted on his own. If upstairs is involved? It's a different story. Why hide the killer? Hi. To confirm death without the body how much blood are we talking about? Blood loss of 2.4~3 liters is usually lethal. A sudden loss of over a liter can kill you. The amount at the scene was way over 3 liters. So it was enough for us to confirm death. Did forensics find DNA or fingerprints at the scene that didn't belong to the defendant? No, not at all. - Signs of forced entry? - None. So it can't be anybody else but the defendant. Objection! It's leading. Let me rephrase it. Is there any possibility it could be someone else? No. No more questions. The door was open when they arrived at the scene. So anything is possible. You said nobody broke in. Couldn't she have walked out? That's possible. But very unlikely. So you're saying it's not impossible. Objection! The defense is playing on words. The witness was referring to a general concept. Sustained. The killer walked out the door. He didn't even clean the scene. Doesn't that mean it was on impulse? These were taken at the scene. A blood-stained bed sheet. A dining table. Pay attention to this one. Only one candle didn't burn all the way down. Because it was lit afterwards. Estimated to be lit at 12:20 a.m. That's the time of death calculated by forensics through a coagulation of blood. Say the killer lit it. How would you evaluate his mental state? He didn't miss the candle, excited after killing. I suspect an anti-social personality disorder. What? Speak English, please. A psychopath. Objection. It's all circumstantial. We shouldn't rule out other possibilities. It could've been lit by the third person. What's your basis on that? I say the Government has a reasonable theory. Please, continue. Let me remind you. No other fingerprints were found at the scene except the victim and the defendant's. And there were no signs of forced entry. Only one person could have lit that candle. Thanks. She became confident after the marriage. And she worked very hard. It was good. Nobody would touch it. It's all superstition. Then again, she was quite different. What's wrong? Her mother objected to her husband? Don't tell me. Very possessive. She considered her girl a belonging. She would've objected to any guy. Was she seeing someone? No way. She was almost obsessed with her husband. He's said to have the delusion of infidelity. No, it was her. She was even seeing a shrink. She was? She was treated for depression. Find out what hospital she went to. And a month prior to the murder HAN was away for 3 days on business. Her colleague says she got worse after that. Delete? Let's go home. Go ahead. KANG called Detective LEE for his witness. He's coming out swinging. We expected that. No. It doesn't feel right. LEE might start talking in court to save his ass. We will go as planned. If it doesn't work, we all go down. Prepare for the worst. We can't afford to make us a laughing stock. Know what I mean? You want me to come in? We don't know what he did with the CCTV file. That's why I called him for our witness. He finds out we know he took it. He doesn't wanna testify. He will contact us. If this doesn't work? We will grind him in court. OK, I'm on my way. Who the hell are you? Wait, wait. I'm Detective LEE. - Who? - LEE Byung-guk. - LEE Byung-guk? - Yes, drive. I have something to tell you. Hit the road. - Really? - Yes. You're Detective LEE? That's me. You have that CCTV file? Prosecutor AHN does. What's in it? I have no idea. We thought you deleted it. If you want it I can get you a copy. In return? No testimony. And he'll talk through me. That's all? He wants to be left alone once he hands us the file. Can we trust him? We have no choice. They must've kept it for a reason. If they submit it to court and HAN is in it? We're fucked. Let's see what's in it. Okay. KANG removed LEE off the witness list. He must've contacted him. Should we proceed? Sir? What the... Shut up. AHN put a tail on me. I had to lose him. God, it's getting worse. I'm scared shitless. I don't think I can do this. Don't back down now. I know, but I'm too scared. What should we do? He was beaten up by other inmates. We almost lost him. What are you talking about? Think about it. They got the scent and put a tail on LEE. There's this lieutenant whose son has leukemia. Hospital bills are up to his eyeballs. Are you suggesting we buy their evidence? No way in hell. We have no other options. No way! Then what? Stop the car. KANG! I said no. We will put LEE on the witness stand. If HAN is in that CCTV file? We're screwed in court! My answer is still no! Don't talk to LEE anymore. Period! God! Resident Register HAN Cheol-min JANG Ho-won Hey. What's the emergency? Remember that high school girl killing? Yeah. A high school girl went missing at night. 12 hours later, found dead at the park. The killer raped her and banged her head on the ground to death. But he didn't leave behind any evidence. The police were afraid it might lead to serial killings. So they did everything. They even went public and put a bounty on him. However, the killer is still on the loose. You know what? They did have a suspect. They were certain he did it. But he was released on lack of evidence. HAN was questioned for 3 days. That explains his 3 days of disappearance. Where'd you get this? Somebody sent it anonymously. A cop? You should've have done it. He should know about him as his attorney. If you testify, you can't come back. If I don't? We might lose the case. You can win if I testify? I don't know. Let me level with you. Whatever it takes, I wanna win. So I need you to testify. Sergeant SEO? A high school girl killing? I don't know. They sure can keep secrets. Keep talking. They had a suspect, and he was a hard-ass. They knew he did it, but there was no evidence. Know that Professor CHOI from Police University? The one who gets on TV? He interrogated the guy and said he was innocent. Then they let him walk. See you. I'm not at liberty to talk about HAN. I'm only seeing you cause you came to see me. Why was HAN the suspect? He was like the killer Poker face. No< fingerprints. And he wasn't shaken at all for a 3-day-Iong questioning. The cops were running out of patience. I'm not the killer. What the fuck! You piece of shit! Motherfucker! You can't book him without evidence! You wanna see my ass getting fried? The prosecutor said if we... What are you, a moron? If things go wrong? It's us who take the fall! Where's Sergeant SEO? I want his ass in my office! Boss? Go get me evidence. You saw him. He has no fingerprints. He can't leave evidence. And that son of a bitch doesn't have an alibi. The witness said it wasn't him? I don't understand it. He picked out his mugshot and said no at the line up. - He picked out his mugshot? - Yes! Get Professor CHOI. Professor CHOI. Why'd you use a lie detector? Sorry. Not even admissible in court. There's no way to get him to talk now. What then? We will do it tonight. Place a pile of documents on the table to pressure him. And get a bloody rock as if it were evidence. The location of the table is important. Put it where HAN has to turn his head to look at it. If he's the killer, he can't ignore it. I'm not asking if you did it. I know you did it. Why did you go back to the scene? I was walking by and saw the crowd. So I got curious. We have a witness. He identified you as a killer at the scene. You can choose. A prison? Or a hospital? You will be treated for insanity. Your witness got the wrong person. He's not the killer! Release him now! When I heard of his arrest, I couldn't believe it. The prosecutor for that case It was AHN Min-ho. HAN. Are you that stupid? If you hide it, you only raise suspicion. I wasn't thinking right. I didn't think it would do me any good. So I kept it from you. Can't you see what's going on here? They'll create a motive out of it! Am I the only one who cares about this trial? Is that it? Come on, spill the beans. You did it, didn't you? Tell me honestly! You had no other reason to keep it from me! Come on. You killed her, didn't you? The way you look at me It's not different from the way others do. That stopped me from telling you. You're the only one I can depend on now. But you don't believe me. I didn't kill my wife. I can't even accept the fact she's dead. So don't look at me like that. I did not kill my wife. KANG. Why'd you turn your phone off? KANG? We're gonna lose. No way. It's not HAN in that CCTV file. If we get hold of it, we can totally win. If HAN was in it they had no reason to hide it. HAN was a suspect for a high school girl killing. I knew he was strange. So we're giving up? What should we do? Who knows what that detective did? We need to get that file. HAN isn't in it. Let's call it a night. I will call you. What's this? You hit the booze without me? Being an attorney sucks. What's going on here? You think I can pull this off? Damn. Attorney KANG, Can I tell you something? Yeah. It never crossed my mind that you might lose. This photo makes me feel weird. So happy back then. They didn't see this coming, did they? I know. What if HAN is the killer? Tell me. Do you have doubts about his innocence? I do. One thing is clear. The police told the wife her hubby was a killer. She didn't believe it. So they threatened her with a conspiracy thing. How do you think that made her feel? Well Shitty, I bet. She came to see you 3 days prior to murder? We didn't talk much after she got married. So I was surprised when she came without a call. What did she say? She was shaking out of fear. Honey, what's wrong? What is it? Come on, tell me. Come on! He's not the man I knew. What do you mean? Be specific. He might kill me. Back then I didn't know what that meant. I shouldn't have sent her back. Was she always that sensitive? No. She was nice and docile before the marriage. But she changed completely. Constantly nervous as if she were being chased. It's all because of him. He ruined my daughter. My little girl Tell us. What's he like to you? He's not human. He's a demon. I knew it when I first saw him. Do you think he's capable of killing your daughter? I do! Thank you. No more questions. You knew she was in danger. Why didn't you do anything? You had 3 days. You could've found a way to help her. Did you talk to her afterwards? I was so confused then. And I didn't know how she would react. So you put your feelings before her safety? Did she really say her husband might kill her? The victim missed work for 2 months before the marriage. Why was that? She was so sick I sent her to a prayer retreat. Not a hospital? Why a prayer retreat? Why did she miss work and go to the prayer retreat? You should pray to heal your mind. So you sent her there against her will? Objection! The defense is reviling her religious life. Watch yourself, counselor. You opposed their marriage. You felt betrayed she was leaving you. So you were mad at him. Isn't that right? Because he stole your girl. What'd you say to her that day? Did you try to force her into the prayer retreat? Objection! Counselor? I just You need to pray. Let's go to the prayer retreat. Let go. You're insane. You've fallen into a devil's trap! Look at yourself! I'm sorry I came. I told her to leave that demon. I told her to get out of that demon's nest. HAN Cheol-min! You killed her, didn't you? You ruined my girl! You killed my girl! No more questions. Prosecutor AHN Min-ho - I want it back ASAP. - Okay. I can get fired for this. I'm risking my ass here. Don't worry. We're saving a man's life. This will prove we were right. LEE, you're doing the right thing. As the leader of the pack is nowhere to be seen he tries to mate with her. She resists hard, but it's of no use. Asshole! What the hell is this? You fucking tricked me! Asshole! You're dead! You fucking baldy! You lying son of a bitch! How can you... Who the hell are they? You called your buddies? He was being cunning, and the price should be paid. What were you thinking, stealing evidence? I had no idea what it was. My headache is gone. We'll indict him for bribery. His license will be revoked, and he's done. You'll get what you want. What do I want? HAN To nail HAN Cheol-min. I could've done that in court. It's better than putting Sergeant SEO on the stand. All is well. Your father. Professor AHN will be happy, too. He never liked me when he was my boss. Send him my regards. I never imagined AHN would go that far. An entrapment? He sure keeps himself busy. - Turn around. - What? Turn around. Where are we going? I need a lawyer. Professor? What are you doing here? You're on KANG's case, aren't you? Yes. What about it? I'm here to see you as his attorney. What? Professor AHN? Where? KANG, you crazy fuck! Bye, Professor. Hi. Not going up? No, I was going down. You came to see PARK? We have our own principles. You might think... Stop talking. Okay. Professor? Why don't we have lunch? Father. Do you have to do this? This isn't about winning. It's aboutjustice. Save it. Why are you doing this fight? To catch a killer. That's my job. Not to save your pride? That's right. I've put my pride on this fight. What you're doing isn't right. It's not a good idea. Sir? He tried to buy evidence. He's no good to defend. It was an entrapment, and they don't have a case. I'm still good to defend. He stole the hard evidence. He should've submitted CCTV file as evidence. We were going to, but he contaminated it. They kept it from us and used it to trap me. I can prove my claim. I call Detective LEE for our witness. I also call Detective LEE for our witness to prove his wrongdoing. Shut up! If he hasn't been indicted, he's still good. That doesn't mean you're off the hook. It's clear that the defense tried to buy evidence. Therefore, that CCTV file is contaminated. I don't wanna hear a word about that anymore. So I won't allow that witness. Any questions? Now Any other witnesses? I call Sergeant SEO. A month prior to murder the victim requested him to investigate HAN. - That doesn't - I will consider it. Listen, KANG. I'm warning you. If this happens again, I'll hold you in contempt of court. Okay. Yes! I'm driving like crazy now. I will see you in no time. That old man is dying to see me now? Excuse me. I called you earlier. What's the compensation? My son is crippled for good. Here. Smiling? My son is crippled, and you're smiling? Calm down and tell me what happened. So we can work out something. Is this your car? 49 DA 7595? Oh Do you remember what time it happened? It was 1:30 in the morning. You hit him and ran. An apology would be nice. Oh! I'm really sorry. I'm not really from an insurance firm. Can you tell me what exactly happened? My client will compensate more than enough. - You sure? - Yes. Now you're talking. My son was riding a bike. And then... What? How do you know the victim? I was a homicide detective. A high school girl was killed a year ago. And HAN was our suspect. I met her then. You knew the defendant first. Yes. We questioned him off the record. But he walked on lack of evidence. I've been watching him ever since I left the force. Why? You had nothing against him. I was sure he was the killer. I tailed him for a while, but nothing. So I decided to put a bug in his place. She knew he had lied about his business trip. So I told her that we had questioned him for murder for 3 days. No evidence. But he was still a key suspect. I asked for help, and she agreed. Did that work? No. I lost contact with her 3 days prior to murder. So I followed her around. It was that high school girl who got killed. "Our beloved daughter Rest in peace" A few hours later, she called me. She said she had evidence against HAN. Objection! It's argumentative. I have a transcript. The Criminal Procedure Code states clearly that evidence not acquired through due process of law can't be used as evidence in the court of law. There are two precedents set by the Supreme Court. Sustained. It can't be evidence. The witness' testimony is based on illegal evidence. It shouldn't affect the jury in any ways. I'd like to hear what the witness has to say. Overruled. Then what? What happened? HAN suddenly left on a business trip. It didn't feel right so I tailed him. But he cut his trip short and headed back home. I ended up losing him. I called the police right away. Good 30 minutes later, the cops came. You were a trusted detective. Your work performance was excellent. Why did you quit? Cops catch criminals. Do you know how it feels, releasing a killer? I couldn't do anything within the law. I was so upset. So I decided to catch him at any cost. Do you feel responsible in any way for the victim's death? Until my last breath. She had evidence against the defendant. And she was murdered. All the facts are clear. The defendant had motive to murder his wife. You said she was helpful. Didn't you think she would be in danger? I did. That's why I asked her. No wife wouldn't be shocked to learn that her husband might be a killer. I did it to protect her. From whom? The man whom you let walk? I was certain he was the killer. You said you would catch him at any cost. You don't care who gets hurt as long as you get it done? Objection! He's distorting the witness' good will. Sustained. It's all what you think it is. No evidence to support your claim. It's very hard to believe you acted alone. Anybody else involved? No. This case is deeply related to a high school girl killing. Nobody else is involved? No, I did it on my own. Last question. Please name the prosecutor you worked with on that case. Prosecutor AHN Min-ho. No more questions. Come on! I don't like courts and the police station. My heart is racing. I can't do it. Look, listen to me. His life is in your hands. Go back in there and tell them what you saw. That's all I'm asking. God I don't wanna get involved in someone else's life. You work it out for yourselves. I don't know shit. Let's go home. Damn it! Sir? Money? Defendant, take the stand. Wait. The defense calls a new witness. He's not on the list. May I approach? Yes, both of you. He will prove my client's alibi. It's unacceptable. We got a call this morning. Be understandable. No way. I didn't object to Sergeant SEO. Make it fair for us. Hold on. Let's listen to him. - Make it short. - Okay. Witness, take the stand. Stand up. Raise your hand. I swear to tell the truth. The whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me, God. On December 9th, on a Seoul-bound highway. You saw a car accident? Yes. Please tell us what you saw. I run a five-and dime store along the highway. My son came in limping so I asked him what happened. He said that a car drove into the shoulder and hit him. What? I told you not to Bike at night! So I ran outside. And there was a SUV standing on the shoulder. I ran over to see the driver. Hey! And that bugger just bolted. Hey! - You saw the plate? - Yes. It's 49 DA 7595 Okay. This photo was taken right after his arrest. Please, notice the bumper that was damaged. What time was it? 1:30 in the morning. No more questions. Why didn't you report it right away? I didn't think my boy got hurt that much. It was a minor accident from two months ago How do you remember it so well? I wrote down the time and plate just in case. You didn't get a look at the driver? Right. Was it your will to testify? Or were you promised to get paid? Objection! I just came for compensation for a hit and run. Oh, let me get this straight. The defense promised compensation for what you saw two months ago? And you didn't really see it happen. Objection! The defense counsel tried to buy evidence before. Now he's trying to buy a witness. Answer the question. Were you promised compensation? What else would I be here for? Listen. Perjury is a serious crime. It's maximum 5 years in jail! What? Sit down! Where are you going? Sit down. What's going on here? I'm going home! Mr. HAN. Why didn't you tell your wife Why didn't you tell her what happened? Why didn't you? Why didn't he tell his wife? HAN Cheol-min. You were questioned for a high school girl killing. Why didn't you tell your wife? She was so vulnerable. I just couldn't. Did you know what situation she was in? No. I had no idea she was in so much pain. I thought she was cheating on me. Talking to a cop, I never imagined it. She'd been seeing a shrink because of you. It was bad enough for her to try suicide. As her husband, how could you not know? I didn't have the slightest idea until today. I often did overtime at work and didn't spend much time with her. I just thought she wasn't as talkative as before. I don't buy that. You just avoided her on purpose. No! He's grinding him. You can't let him testify. AHN will fire back. Then what do we have to show the jury? Emotions. What about that trip? You're a film developer. Why'd you go to the set? I was requested to be there. Ask them. Why'd you cut the trip short? It was our anniversary. I wanted to do something for her to turn things around. It took 5 hours for you to get to Seoul. Which is long enough to make a round trip. I had a hard time staying awake. I missed the turnpike. So I took a highway. I didn't know where I was. It was so dark. When I came to, hours had passed. I turned the car around and headed home. I didn't wanna leave her alone on our anniversary. Mr. HAN. You just wanted to run from her. You just wanted to end your marriage. You knew the pain she was in and ignored it. Please... Are you responsible for her death? Objection, Your Honor. You don't have to answer that question. Let me ask you again. Are you responsible for your wife's death? Whose fault is her death? Who killed her? Objection! Counsel! Who killed her? I killed her. Is that the answer you wanted? Yes. I killed her. I wish I could drop dead. Am I really a killer? Did I... Did I really kill my wife? I didn't. But people keep saying that I did. So I must be mistaken. Sometimes I look in the mirror and see a killer. How's that possible? My fingerprints? My hands are wet with chemicals for 12 hours a day. My fingertips are always split and raw. So I used to wash them hundreds of times a day. After I was questioned for murder I never wash them anymore. Because I know now it can be a sin. Yet, I had my wife to help me stand. Sure. You can brand me as a killer. But don't deny the fact I truly loved my wife. I still don't think she's dead. I can't I can't I just can't accept it. So, please. Find my wife for me. I did everything wrong. Give me a chance to seek forgiveness. Please, give me a chance. The defense rests. Let me go to the bathroom. That broker digs up dirty witnesses for you? What about you? You brainwash them to lie. Is it fun? You turned a dumbass into a killer. Did that ignite justice in you? Sure. It's on fire. So shut your hole. You know what? You and your client are so good together. So much alike. Sergeant SEO acted alone? I would be fucked if he did. How does it feel, passing the buck? The whole world knows that you put him into it. You give your father a bad name. Asshole! Let go! You're doing it the wrong way. Wrong? I don't care if I can bust his ass. HAN is the killer. And you try to let him walk? You got the wrong guy. You guys killed his wife. You'll pay the price for this. Shit. Were you scared yesterday? He says it was noisy. Yeah? Yes, it was. Everybody was getting so upset. Yeah, I know. Go ahead, counsel. I admit it. All we have against him is circumstantial evidence. But try to see the character of the defendant's. He was a prime suspect for a high school girl killing. His wife found out about it. And he killed her cruelly to destroy evidence. Beneath that innocent face is nothing but a killer. An advertent, cold-blooded one who killed his wife. The defense counsel might put it this way. His wife was depressed and stressed out. She stabbed herself and walked out the door alive. But think about it. Forensics testified there was over 3 liters of blood at the scene. You can't bleed that much unless the artery is cut off. Let me tell you again. There were no signs of forced entry. Nobody but the defendant could be inside that apartment. Please, remember that. Let me ask you. What is justice? All the facts say that HAN is the killer. But we can't punish him for circumstantial evidence? That's notjustice. It's evasion of responsibility. We have to stop the killings. And we need your help. Please, letjustice be brought. Thank you. Defense counsel? Closing argument, please. It's often said. It's better to release 10 guilty men than punishing 1 innocent man. Why? What violates justice the most is a ruling that's not based on evidence. There's no evidence at all HAN committed a crime. As the prosecution admits, it's all circumstantial. It's a very dangerous thing. It can be interpreted in many different ways. This case has become a tragedy because everything was based on circumstances. No solid evidence. They predetermined that HAN killed that girl. And they told his wife what they believed was true. Shocked and scared, she went to her mother for help. But her mother turned her head away. What drove the victim off the cliff? A wrong interpretation of circumstances. We call it prejudice. HAN is just a man of himself. An introvert. Someone we may call a clean freak. And prejudice turned him into a monstrous killer. Why? As I mentioned earlier any theory is possible without evidence. I expect you to doubt the prosecution's theory. Is it really plausible? Is his wife really dead? Look. I count to three. And his wife will walk in through the doors. One. Two. Three. Did you look at the doors? If you did, you're not sure if she's really dead. It means that you all have reasonable doubt. Please, let my client be a free man. Thank you. Kid? Tell me. Is this the right way? A shortcut? This is a shortcut? Thanks. It looks familiar. Why is that? Have I been here with my wife? All rise. JANG Ho-won The jury didn't reach a unanimous decision. So I've given this case a lot of thought. We have a case for which there isn't physical evidence such as the body and a murder weapon. In our court of law, a crime can be proved through indirect evidence that is tolerated by reason according to the precedents set by the Supreme Court. However if contrary evidence shakes the basis of the argument then that indirect evidence should be questioned. Considering all indirect evidence presented I can't say it's strong enough to support the charge. I hereby deliver a verdict. Defendant? Please, rise. Docket Number 2010-46514. On the charge of murder, I find the defendant... Not guilty. HAN. You're free now. Please, this way. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Thanks. KANG? We will appeal. Get some tangible evidence. Your closing argument? Pretty smart. You know what? At the count of 3, he didn't look back. A dam? Yes. This is where he took that picture with his wife. There's a back road here leading to that store. HAN knew about that? Yes, I think he came out here on purpose. The car didn't run him over. He biked into that car parked there. That old man lied. He didn't wanna pay for the damage. HAN wasn't in the car then. The boy saw him later coming from the dam. His wife will walk in through the doors. One. Two. Three. I did not kill my wife. KANG? Do you believe me? She's missing a tooth. Him! That guy! Oh, the door is open. How are you doing? Life is funny, isn't it? The killer will be caught. He knew she had been talking to a cop. 38 NA 6609, pull over. Pull over now. The prosecution was wrong from the get-go. If she felt her life was threatened she would've run, not making dinner. She trusted her husband. Tell me it's not true. Tell me it's not. No. Please... You need to calm down. I wonder how he moved the body. You know how, don't you? I don't understand what you're saying. Somebody saw you coming down from the dam. What are you trying to be? If you're a lawyer, act like one. Why playing prosecutor? How'd you move the body? HAN. Get down. Scared? That I mightjump? It would be over then. Okay. Okay. How did you move your wife's body? You still look at me like that. Like when we first met. Answer me. HAN Cheol-min. Get down. Get down! Come here! Don't move! - What do you want in return? - I don't know. Smoking together? You broke the attorney client privilege. I reported an act of crime. But it will affect your rep. I don't care. Anyway, let's put all this behind us. We're much alike after all. No, we are not. I still think you're doing it the wrong way. Do me a favor. Drop my charge, will you? It's here! See you around.
