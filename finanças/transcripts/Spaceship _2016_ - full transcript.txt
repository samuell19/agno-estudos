Subtitles by explosiveskull You know, I believe that there's life forms on other planets, but I don't think I believe in aliens. Maybe not aliens, but... Maybe... Yeah, something... No way. Somewhere out there. Some sort of bacteria growing somewhere. Yeah. Hope so. Yeah... If they were a light year away and they were a light year closer, they'd live for light years... for a light year longer than us. I reckon one day, they'll come and visit us, maybe. There is some other sort of life force outside this planet. I watched a documentary where, like, people say they, like... I don't know, they... They'd been abducted or something. Yeah. Humans, us on Earth, know of at least five different types of aliens. Can't just have us in this universe, can you? I don't know if they're just crazy or not. Do you think you need to see it to believe it? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLAYS # I know places we can go # So hold on tight, it's gonna be fun # I know places we can go, so hold on tight... # LUCIDIA: My mum disappeared when I was seven years old. When I say disappeared, I mean they told me she was dead. But you should have seen her eyes. She was floating in the pool with this smile on her face. Like she was somewhere else. # Let's go down to the city with me and see what we can see... # There's a dream I have. I'm being chased by vampires in a forest. But I can fly. So when they get close to me, I look up at the sky and shoot upwards. But then I realise they can fly too. Dreams can be really ironic. Most of the kids round here think they were abducted by aliens. At one point, my local college was nearly empty. The police looked everywhere. They all came back three days later with stories that didn't make sense. The college said they'd been hiding out in some old World War II bunker. But they denied that. HE SHOUTS HE HOWLS HE HOWLS My dad's Finnish, but I grew up in Wales. I never went to his home. He never wanted to go back. We've moved around a lot with Dad's job. When Mum died, we stayed here. But I find it hard to be still now. Something's calling me on. # I'll sing you this October song # Oh, there is no song before it... # Don't dig it too deep. Dig deeper, but not too deep. # The words and tune are none of my own # For my joys and sorrows bore it # Beside the sea # The brambly briars, in the still of evening... # Aldershot's home of the British Army, and me. I'm not in the Army. Maybe I'll go someday. Squaddies are really cute. They're all pumped up and worried about defending the country. They cycle around on BMXs, keeping fit. Dad came here because the Army kept blowing up the hills and discovering all these buried dead people from thousands of years ago. Where have you been? I was working. Did you find anything? No. Bit of a waste of time, then. We'll find something. I've been thinking about Mum. HE SINGS IN FINNISH GABRIEL IN VOICEOVER: When we had fights, I would always find her under the bridge. She never told me what she was doing there. I could stand next to her for two or three hours. Then she'd just tell me that it was time to go home. I'm just a bit bored of kissing humans. What do you mean? I mean... ..do you not find it a bit boring? Like, all the saliva? Like, they have different techniques. People like different things. But all in all, it's just, like... It's bland. Just trust me. What are you doing? It's all part of the theory. You ready? OK. > LAUGHING: Ow! What are you doing? What does it taste like? Mmm, it tastes like burger. But I didn't really get much out. I mean, I didn't hit an artery or anything. Why don't you try it again? No, I can't. I've got to go to band practice. TEGAN IN VOICEOVER: I went out with this guy once, on the internet. He said he couldn't meet me because he was in hiding. He was in Lithuania. In the last few days that we spoke, he told me he wanted me to go and find him. In Disneyland Paris. Start off, just one shot jumping, and... Unlucky. Try, when you're going for it, put your hand up and back like this, so when you're coming up, and... into that. Oh! Do you play a lot? Do you play a lot of sport? LAUGHING: No! Why not? Why not, seriously? Not my thing. Yeah, but that's the whole point, it should be your thing. The whole point of sport is it should be everyone's thing, everyone should be fit, everyone should be happy, that's what would make the world a better place. Give it here, then. LUCIDIA: There was this kid in my class who said he was from Albania, but he was really from Milton Keynes. He thought he was a vampire. He got too into it. He started giving all of the girls love bites. Do you remember the day he climbed to the top of the roof? Said he was going to fly away and start a new breed of human. Said it was just time to start over. Then he just vanished into thin air. Well, she's a teenager and, er, I suppose she's pushing her limits. I'm... I'm sorry, but I don't think that's acceptable. Yeah... Well, she don't have a mother. So, um, all I can do is... It's more like supporting her independency. You can't let your child just run off and do whatever she likes. She cannot be on a roof! You really think she would have jumped down? She never would have jumped down. So, what was she doing? She wanted to fly. You shouldn't bring a gun to the table. Why don't you come and spend time with me on site? Hmm? I want to start using the pool again. Mmm. We've got some good finds going on. You should come. I don't want to spend another summer in a load of mud. Tama ta... Tama tata.

THEY BOTH SHOUT IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE LUCIDIA IN VOICEOVER: My mum was all over the place. She was like a Barbie doll on speed who'd just got out of rehab and couldn't control Ken. Once, I heard her talking in her sleep. She was giving landing directions. To aliens. And back, down... Up. Make sure you just keep looking, right, cos... Yeah, yeah. I'm watching. Making sure I'm copying. Yeah, that's it. That's it, mate. Yeah, again. Try not to jerk it. Nice and slow, drag forward. That's it. GABRIEL: The Army blew a massive hole in the ground. Left this gaping hole down into an underground chamber from the Neolithic. It was some kind of, um, cult hang-out place. The Army tried to ignore it, until we found out. The archaeologists moved in, and we've been in the area ever since. How's it going? GRUNTING: It's going fine. I don't know that we found something there, you know, from the inside of the earth. I think everything we find in there comes from the outside. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's not that the earth can tell us something, it's more about we are learning things about... ..I don't know, people who put something in there. For us. To be found. Yeah. They want... They want us to find. I love your... I like your romantic way of seeing things. You think it's romantic? Yeah, I think it's... quite romantic. I think it's rational. DREAMY MUSIC INAUDIBLE SPEECH When I was younger, I wanted to be a detective. So, that would be kind of cool, to still do it. You don't need qualifications, do you? Do you? Mmm... I think maybe you just need more experience. I've got years of experience. My mum got me this, like, detective kit when I was younger, and I'd just go and sit on a bench and watch people, and I'd think about what type of criminal they'd be, or what crime they'd committed. I always had this thing where you'd get, like, a calculator and pretend it was, like... What, like a spy gadget? Yeah. It's just pops out loads of stuff? If, when we're older, I end up being a detective and if you end up being a spy, and if the Government calls me and they wanted me to follow you and turn you in, I wouldn't, I'd protect you. You'd sacrifice your job for me? Course I would, cos we're friends, aren't we? I wouldn't protect you. Doesn't matter, I'd still protect you. Go, go! LUKE IN VOICEOVER: There was medieval mattresses up there, '80s ski jackets, stuff from another life, someone else's life. When I was at school, Kriss Akabusi came to inspire us. Bet he went running here, before the Army blew it up. I found a pair of Nike trainers and put them in the washing machine. Those trainers are Kriss Akabusi's trainers. KRISTOF: I love Anthrax. Do you know Anthrax? GABRIEL: No, I don't. You don't? No. Well, I love them. I like Manowar. I like Manowar too. Actually, I wanted to be a rock star. I was roadie for Manowar. Really? Yeah, that was my first job. To Manowar? Yeah. Wow. You know, before they went on stage, you know what they did? What? They'd spray this, this oil, you know, on their bodies. Yeah? Yeah. And then, they did these weights, to get all pumped up for the crowd, you know? And then, they had a Harley-Davidson. Yeah. On which they drove up on a ramp into the stage. Yeah? Yeah. And with these motorbike sounds, but you know what? It wasn't even switched on. We were staying behind and pushing it up! WHISPERING: Hey. Why aren't you on the ice? Er... Just give me a chance, you know? I don't want to make you look bad, show you up. Think you'd make me look bad? Probably. OK, come on, then. Is that a challenge? I don't know. I don't mind being made to look bad. No? No. You know you're going toe to toe with a dancer? Then prove it, come on. HE CHUCKLES Get on the ice, dancer boy! All right. Come on, then. I've just got to psych myself up a bit, mentally. Or maybe that means you're not really a dancer. We dance to, like, rock, reggae, hip-hop... # To the winners! # To the wall! (To the wall!) # Till the sweat jumps on my path # Make all these bridges fall... # Plie, and one and two and three... I just woke up in the middle of the night, with my motorbike, in the middle of a field. Of a field? Field, yeah. It was beautiful, you know. The grass was wet, you know? And its engine kept me warm all night long. It was like... ..yeah, the most beautiful illusion of freedom. Yeah, but it's just an illusion, right? Yeah, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. But how can you be satisfied with knowing that it's just an illusion, you know? Because I love that illusion. Why don't you have an illusion of freedom with a car? No, it's, it's... ..it's kind of combined illusion and reality. Of course it's reality when you're riding a bike, but the feeling you get, you get the feeling of freedom. You know? So, you're un... In a way, you're uncovered, you're naked, you know, even though you have leathers on or whatever. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. I would love to do it. Yeah, but we can do it, you know. I have no licence. You have no...? It doesn't matter. I have a motorbike. We can travel across Sahara if we want. Sahara, to go to the pyramids? Yeah, we can do that if we want. Really? Yeah. Tutankhamen? Yeah, Tutankhamen especially, yeah. Wow. This whole valley of Egypt, it's full of nightclubs - we should go there. Yeah, we should go there. Yeah. With a motorbike, yeah. Yeah, with yours? Mine, yeah. Both together, on one motorcycle? Yeah, it's possible, yeah. Wow. Yeah. That would be romantic, even! Are you kidding me? Yeah, I would like that. Now I got a bit scared! UPBEAT MUSIC # Whatever you want # Whatever you need... # You going on holiday? I could take you. I need a holiday as well. I haven't had one in a while. I want to get away. # Is there anything else left to go wrong? # LUCIDIA: I had this poster above my bed. This guy was reaching out. There was a tower behind him, shaking in the sky. And they wanted to pull me inside. But I wanted to pull them out. My grandma believed in fairies. She said they used to tell her to do things. Said they were going to take over the world. She spent her last few days gibbering on about how the fairies were coming and everything was going to be amazing. "Soon", she said. I haven't seen any yet, apart from some tiny footsteps I saw in a puddle of muddy water once. And they glistened in the moonlight. Where you going? I'm going home. This is a crap holiday. I think next year I'm going to go to Ibiza. PANTING Come on. Gabriel, come on. No, I'm, I'm staying. We're losing light. It's losing me. Don't drink too much, OK? Mum and Dad told you, don't drink too much. You were drinking when you were 13, so... That was a family occasion. That was different. Your mum was in the kitchen and you went up onto the table, took the glass and drunk it. You fell off the table, drunk off your face. LAUGHTER We all know about it. You didn't go into school for weeks. I heard you ended up in a hedge where you pissed yourself. LAUGHTER ..What happened to Jack, like, two weeks ago... OVERLAPPING CHATTER LAUGHTER And we passed a tattoo... piercing parlour and went, "Yes!" OK, let's go in and get some decorative piercings. I took it out when I... GIRL INTERRUPTS LAUGHTER No, I didn't get a St Albert but I... ..oh...! ALL EXCLAIM That's a story for another day, but I did, I got my nipple pierced, I got my nipple pierced and I got a decorative little tassel to go with it... Yeah, they're healed at the moment but you know... Why didn't you keep it? Why didn't I keep it? Because I'm not a burlesque dancer. LAUGHTER TEGAN IN VOICEOVER: I always wanted to be a unicorn, like in that game, the one where it flies all over the place until it gets sucked into a big black hole. The hole's full of glitter, with some kind of amazing world in there. There's neon pink apples growing on trees, perfect for unicorns. Lucidia! Lucidia? DEEP RUMBLING LUCIDIA! LUCIDIA!

Further back. Shall I knight you? If you wish. If you think I deserve it. Down, down! I knight... ..thee Alice's slave. Property of... ..Alice. Does that not make you feel, like, weird? Dominating someone, like... It's not dominating. It kind of is! It's not. You basically own him. Every relationship is like that. We're just honest with each other. Yeah, but...he's your property. You're not his. Yeah, but, in a way... I'm your property and you're mine. It's like people are just spinning round each other in circles and then occasionally they just collide. You know when you see those shamans...the tribesmen...on TV? On those programmes. And they're, like, chanting in a circle... with the smoke and the ashes... ..and you see, you see them trying to get to another world. And you can only see the whites of their eyes. It's a step up from... Is that working? ALICE CHUCKLES LAUGHTER Where have you been? There was, like, stuff happening above, in the sky, and it was just like she was sucked away, she was sucked into...another dimension or something. An alien abduction. I reckon she killed herself. Why is that the first thing that comes to your mind? Her mum did, didn't she? That doesn't mean that she's going to do it herself, does it? Maybe you did it. You look kind of strange, different. I am...different. I mean, what I saw... It made me believe in something more. More than this. VOICE MAIL: You're calling me and I'm not here. I'm somewhere else. You're calling me and I'm not here. I'm somewhere else. Open the door - this huge world is spread out in front of you. You come out from the darkness into the blinding sunlight, and you're on a river bank, there's trees, the music is swelling, and you think, "Oh, my God, this is incredible. "It's open-world. I can go in any direction I want, "I can do anything I want. I can be anything. "I could be a wizard, I could be a warrior, a thief, "I could be the greatest gladiator in all the land."

Nice jacket. Guys, see if you can actually find... I thought the point was to see where she's gone. I wish there were strawberry laces... Don't go through her journal. How do you know what the fuck's in her journal? I don't, I'm just saying, do you want people going through yours? I bet you're in it. I bet you're in it. Yeah, I bet you're in it, as well.

From what? Don't know. Herself. Have you seen this? She's talking to me. My sports teacher went insane. We were so bad at sport. Couldn't take it. He climbed into a cupboard and refused to come out. We gathered round and prayed. He shouted at us. Told us to get better. We can build a better world. "Lypemania. "Melancholia.

You should keep it more secure. Where is she? Get the fuck off him! She just disappeared! It's all right, just chill. I don't know what happened. Cos we were together out by the Army land, and then, um... ..and then I followed her here. Something out there... ..came and took her away. There was, like, electricity in the air, and then... And then I think I saw some kind of strange shapes. But I couldn't really see because the light was in my eyes, and then... There was a... ..vaporisation. Fucking hell! Prop something under his head.

People never submit to their desires, do they? They're always just desiring desires, and then when other people actually have them, they just judge them. Out in Iraq, a couple of our boys, we got attacked by the Americans. F-16s came down. Really? Yeah, blew up three of our tanks. You know, you keep morale up, keep going. That's the risk we all take when we join the Army, kind of, you know, to lose your life. Obviously, no-one wants to be out in the middle of nowhere on Christmas Day. You know, everyone wants to be at home with their family... But they kind of cheered us up with a few beers, a few Christmas decorations and hats, the locals got involved. Yeah? Yeah. They enjoyed it, we enjoyed it. Yeah? Everyone got cheered up. Sounds like good craic. Yeah, yeah, morale was boosted. Yeah, nice. Yeah, it was good fun. Ow! What are you doing? I thought you were going to be brain dead. Or, like, on one of those machines that keeps you alive. I brought you some beer. No! Mm-hmm. HE LAUGHS Of course you did. I want to live on beer. Mmm. Thanks. Do you remember anything about the other night? Yeah. It's coming back to me. I mean, not all of it. I remember bits. I saw an army of unicorns. I saw rainbows... ..and then I saw everything being sucked up into a black hole. And then I saw my life flash forward. I'm going to be a famous shoe designer. Yeah! DREAMY MUSIC TEGAN IN VOICEOVER: Out there... ..are worlds that... ..you can't even begin to imagine. They got valleys full... ..of... ..nuclear rainbows that piss all over your head. They've got unicorns with rocket boosters up their ass. Giant babies just flying around. To Lucidia. To Lucidia. Lucidia. I don't think I do miss her. I think the majority of me is happy that she is where she is, assuming she's happy and... She's done it. And for that reason, I can't... I can't miss her. Yeah. I envy her. Would you rather go all the way up into space, or all the way down to the bottom of the sea? As long as it was where I wanted to be, I wouldn't mind whether I went down or up. Assume that you had no choice and you were forced, you would either go up or down, which one would you prefer? Stuck under the sea, or stranded in the middle of space? Up. Up. Probably go up. Definitely, yeah. Why? I mean, what's so good about being up? I mean, you've got everything to lose. You can fall down. And if someone makes you, I mean... You're just going to go all the way back down to the bottom again. Once you're at the bottom, you've got nowhere to go but up. Where do you think she is? Do you think she's up, or do you think she's down? She probably went down. Do you ever look in the mirror, and every time you move, you just see this other person moving? And it's trippy, it's like a ghost. And I go so far in, sometimes I just end up kissing myself! SHE GIGGLES Or, like, trying to just touch hands, but actually, you're not touching anything cos there's something in between. # Before you ask me again # You'd better think it over... # Everyone says that you can't hold your breath and then kill yourself, can you?

WATER DRIPS Do you come here a lot? Sometimes. This isn't just where they buried people, is it? No. There would be others standing outside. Why? They want to be part of the ritual. But they're not allowed. Only a few have been chosen. And that means we will leave here with some kind of power they don't have. We know something they don't. There's a dead body at the end of the passage. Someone we knew. They're just lying there. They're dead, but they're still here. And that worries us. We don't want their spirit to get lost. Keep them close. Keep them close. Take a bite. Go on. I can see her in your eyes. She can see you, too. DREAMY MUSIC We're not going to find her. I hope we don't find her. I hope we don't find her. The mystery itself is rewarding enough. She's somewhere that we would never understand. Ever. Not while we're here, anyway. We could just follow her. Where? How? Where is she? Come on, it's not that hard, I mean... We don't know where she's gone. So? What if we don't get there? We can look. We can leave our fucking lazy lives and look for her, can't we? I think we should go. But what if we don't get there? As you said... You said, what if we don't get there? What if we get somewhere else? LUCIDIA: Fly like a unicorn, Tegan. Fly into a nuclear rainbow. Take me with you. Who are you? Where am I? You're in my army barracks, that's where. How did you get in here? I was brought here. Maybe it was you. Well, the last three months I was drunk, but I don't remember that. I don't know what happened. I was at home, I disappeared and I woke up here. I can remember flashing lights. Sounds like one of them... ..alien abductions, or... ..something from a film. This isn't a film. I know. You don't look like a squaddie. They've got their arms all pumped up, and short hair. You've got a beard. You're not really in the Army, are you? I was. I just... I got back a few months ago, like. My life's gone a bit downhill, since then. You just need something to... aim for, don't you? Yeah. Well, I got it now. Yeah? What is it? Somewhere around here, there's a cave. There's a kid in a cave. Some of the local lads told me about him. He's having a disco. He's going to... He's going to keep on dancing till he sees something, some kind of... Well, I don't know. One of them... ..things that people see. You know? A vision. What's in the cave? Just him. And a disco. And nothing else. Hey! Where have you been? My daughter is missing. I saw your daughter. What? Yeah, I saw her at the military base. Lucidia. It's me. It's OK. Let me take you home. I'm not your Lucidia. Who are you? I'm my Lucidia. When she disappeared, it was something special. I think she's an angel on fire. Everyone's talking about her. Luke said there were lights and sound. And then she vanished. Are you stoned? So why hasn't she come back? Lots of Lucidias are better than one. You know, I... ..I had this dream. And this baby used to follow me into my room, crawl around on the floor. It had see-through skin. I think once, I tried to fish its heart out. Cos you...you could see all its organs. But then it left. Lucidia... I've got her heart. I've got everything that she has. You're nothing like her. Nothing. Good luck. I wrote a poem. Based on that kid. Disco. Disco... ..disco... ..disco, disco, disco. Disco, disco. Dancing. Dancing, dancing. Dancing, dancing, dancing. Dancing. I lost my jumper. It's beautiful. I'm going to find that kid. The kid in the cave. HE SINGS IN FINNISH Don't drown it. I could use a synth like that. Yeah. Nice synth. DREAMY MUSIC While I was away, I created a whole new breed of human. They're around.

DREAMY MUSIC The unicorn has to get through all the nuclear rainbows, and all the frozen fire. No-one ever knows what's going to happen in the end, cos no-one's ever got there.

She cheated on her boyfriend, and she's wandering around looking for him. # The fallen leaves # That jewel the ground # They know the art of dying # And leave with joy Their glad gold hearts # In the scarlet shadows lying... # MUSIC FADES AWAY # Break it down # Cos you're so far away # Follow where we will be # Being home # Your perfect brain # So fall apart # At last you were taken # You're so far away... # SHE COUGHS AND GAGS It's OK. HE MURMURS It's all right. I just want a way out. There's no way out. How do you know? I've already looked. I'll take you to a hospital. I don't want anyone to know. Yeah, but I should. I'll be OK. # My heart is crashing against the rocks # Responding fiercely # As I face # Your dark eyes... # Can I stay at yours? # This magical day # We fell in love... # Let's go. I won't let you leave. # Two hearts unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained # Flying # Two hearts # Unchained. # I love cartoons. The old ones. Hm. Like Tex Willer. Kind of...Western-style cartoon. Simple stories. Bad guys doing bad things. And then comes Tex Willer with his crew and... ..cleans up the mess. And that's it. Simple. Does it hurt? No. I'll get something for it anyway. FAINT MUSIC RUMBLING # In undiscovered # Carniva-a-a-als # Shopping for # Pharmaceutica-a-a-als # In light of all that is around me # There's something clinical # About me # I scrape my head # Against the grey sky # All sparks and flares # All twists and ri-i-i-ides # Back to the blue # And play your pa-a-a-art # I cannot give less than my hea-art # In spite of all the love inside me... # Where have you been? Ibiza. # There is a question # I've been a-a-asking # He-e-e-e-eaven # How lo-o-ong? # How long? # He-e-e-e-eaven # How lo-o-ong? # How long? # He-e-e-e-eaven # How lo-o-ong? # How long? # He-e-e-e-eaven # How lo-o-ng? # How long? # Heaven, how long till you come? # My warrior, my Prince of Darkness. I belong and you belong. We're at the centre of everything that's awesome. And because of that, I think everything is going to be OK.
