Flash back from the day I went to university it had been close to 10 years since I came back here. The village hadn't changed much. Somehow I felt a stranger. Every road paved is where it should be, as if waiting for my return for the past 10 years. Deep down in my heart I felt a bit regretful, is it that I've left for too long or that I came back here in haste? Chief, - here's to you. - Okay! - Drink up Jinghe. - Okay! Okay, he's making a good impression. Let's bottom up together. C'mon, eat up. C'mon, let's eat. Let's eat! Teacher Chau, Isn't it strange, my son toe's as long as my thumb. When did you came back? I've never thought that it would go so smoothly. I'm going back to the city soon. I'm taking the morning train back tomorrow. Better to go back earlier. It's so unfortunate that you came all the way for nothing. The time is not right to spend money. You see, it'll come again. Teacher Chau, I still remember when you send me on my way to university. You bought 15 'pau', and I ate 11 'pau' in a mouthful. Do you still remember? Yeah! Nuan? Yeah. Nuan! Nuan! It's me, Jinghe! I don't recognised you, Jinghe. Can't imagine running into you here. I've just arrived this morning. It's to discussed Teacher Chau plan's to build a duck barn, I just came back to lend a voice. I heard that, you managed to clear up Teacher Chau 2 years of predicament with just a few words. He bought you drinks as gratitude for your help. The villagers praised that you're a grateful person. It's the devil's weather! Almost could cooked you alive. This year autumn is so hot. I thought that you're not living here in the village anymore. How're you? I'm fine... depends on how you mean by fine. I've ample foods and clothings, and married with a child. Except for the pain in my leg, I'm fine. I'm in good health, is that considered fine? Of course I don't know how you city folks defined fine. You still hate me? Hate you? I'm only angry with God. Goddamn sun is so hot. C'mon, give me a hand. Let me give you a ride on my bike. Forget it. My bum is so big, how're you going to push it? Give me a hand! Wait for me. Ride along while I walked. If you're not leaving, come and visit me. I know now why for so many years the reason's that I did not return to the village. I daren't! I'm afraid to see her, but I'm more afraid that I can't meet her. I remember Nuan once asked me, why is a swing called a swing? In our village, we build a swing every autumn. It's the only source of entertainment in the village for both men and women. I don't know how many years it had been since someone took the liberty to ask this question, including me. Nuan normally asked question's that other people never thought of. When I went to the university, I forgot all about the autumn at the village. I don't really know why a swing is called a swing. Come to think of it, when Nuan and me first started, it seems it's related to the swing. You're home. It's late, Jinghe. The train station's 20 minutes from here. Let me send you there. When'll your brother comes to visit your mum? Don't forget we choose him. Teacher Chau, I'm not leaving today. It's alright if you're not leaving. Someone mum, start the fire and get cooking. Me and Jinghe'll have a few drinks. The wine we had in the afternoon was bland. Jinghe! What can you see? I can the farmer hut. and also I can see 'the mute' toiling in the field. Nuan! What can you see? Me? I can see Beijing. I can also see Tiananmen Square. At that times Nuan and I were still schooling. I was older than her by a few years. Our families were poor, so we took the afternoon session. I'm willing to be with Nuan. After school on the way home everyday, my heart would sang happily. The strange thing was, when Nuan started singing, what she sang... was the same song that I'm singing in my heart. This feeling makes me felt so weird. The other way of saying it is, this makes us unique in a sense. It gave me a lot of confidence. She's a brave and courageous girl within this village. She's beautiful, good in singing and dancing and could be considered the ideal partner. Teacher Chau! Why didn't you mentioned in your letter that Nuan and 'the mute' had gotten married? I'm old and getting forgetful. They've been married close to 6 or 7 years already. 'The mute' father at that time... That year my brother came to fetch my mum, to meet with a match-making prospect in the city. I thought... she had already married to a guy from the city. Jinghe-- can you take along some sweets for me? Give some to Nuan. Her kid is almost 5-6 years old. When you met someone, your view towards perspective of life can undergo a big change. It's as though you're suddenly engulfed by emotions, taking your all including your life and you would even refused to escape. Is Nuan home? Is Nuan home? I'm here! Yau, quick! I'm telling you, your dad's here. Someone's here... Hey, take this! Don't laugh if my house is not what you would expected. Come and have a sit inside. I guess... you'll not be going out since it's raining. We'll see. Come have a sit inside. Don't worried about them, Jinghe. Our show's definitely gonna win an award. We might even get to perform in the city. Yeah, then we'll be able to ride in a car. I would like to ride in a car. We might be chosen to contest faraway from here and needed to travel there by train. C'mon...1, 2, 3. Nuan-- Teacher Tao said that... we're good enough to compete with troupes from the city. Your chances of joining one of the troupes' from the city are very high. It'll be wonderful if selected. Really! Who knows, Nuan might be the next Teresa Teng. Yeah, by that time don't you forget us. Stop it, don't daydream. Look, 'the mute' is coming. 'The mute' is coming. Damn mute, wish you'll die in vain. All your ducks will run away tomorrow. You'll not be able to recover a single one. - Don't move. - Softer. You saw 'the mute' teased me and you didn't offer to help. Go and beat up 'the mute' for me. You hear what I'm saying? I know. Hold still! Chicky, chicky eat sweets. Chicky chicky eat sweets. You eat and I eat too. The sweets is very tasty. I've told him... you came back solely for the purpose of solving Teacher Chau problems. Furthermore I told him that you're now a goverment official in Beijing. If there're any problems, we can asked for your help. I also said to him, that you've found a Beijing girl as your wife. What's your wife occupation? Teaching! We're classmate in the same university. That's nice. How old is your kid? Just a month. Baby boy? Baby boy! City folks normally opted to have children later. I know that you'll get married, but I never thought that you would marry him. You were so frightened of him when you were younger. Have you never heard rivally eventually becoming a couple? Send them home. Move! Move! Move! That year my brother came to fetch my mum. He didn't see you. He said that you went to the city to meet with a groom prospect arranged by the match-maker. At that time, I was hoping that you'll meet someone who'll suit you. He's a store clerk. He wants to meet me after seeing my photo and he accompanied me around town. I stayed at his sister house and helped her to baby-sit. We got on quite well. But she would never go out with me. Later on...after having giving it some thoughts, I really can't imposed myself on other people, and so I came home. She was crying miserably. Ultimately, you didn't meet anyone that's suitable? What do you mean by suitable? And what's not suitable? Nuan, do you still sing? Sing? I hardly talked. He can't talk, and Yauyau took after him and seldom talk too. The entire day I was busy in and outside of the house. Where in the world would I still have the mood? You don't have a TV at home. I guess in the village, most of the villagers had a TV. It's not that I couldn't afford the few hundred dollars... I'm afraid that he can't hear, and would get agitated. I'll be in trouble then. Yauyau was hassling me to buy one. We'll talk later. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! The acrobat troupe is liken to a large magnet. It attracted all the villagers attention both young and old. The event is similar to the autumn 'swing' past times. Problem is, it absorbed certain things away... which is difficult to bring back to it's original placement. Nuan is just like that. Her eyes gazed fully upon the handsome acrobat performer. Nothing can cause her to move away. Nuan had never adored me like that before. Let's go, we're going to be late. Let's go!! Going to be late. You go first. Applied leave for me and said that I'm sick. I'm leaving. Dinner's ready. Hope that you'll be please with my cooking. Come! When this child is not talking, she'll used gestures. She got on well with her father. When you were a child, you used to quarrel with your father. Don't drink too much. He's a good drinker. Just let him win. C'mon! Just hold this for me. Sis, what're you doing? I'm sending it to the troupe. Okay! You just let mum knows. 'The mute' is chasing me. 'The mute' is here. He's after me. All that materialises in front of our sight, although the conclusion is beyond doubt-- ...just refused to accept reality. In my heart at that moment, the taste of bitterness is unbearable. Did he scorched you? It's nothing. You're really kind. Yau...stop playing. Let's have dinner. Uncle! Train. I've seen train on the TV before. Uncle came here by train. Really? (Uncle came here by train) Is the train fast? It's very fast. I'll take you for a train ride one of these day. Mother, uncle is gonna take me for a train ride. (Uncle will take me for a train ride) C'mon! I'm meant to be here. You've the right persona. You should understudy in the city. Can I? Let me speak to the troupe master. Can I really make it? Yeah! You're so beautiful. You're a born artist. Dad! Dad! Dad... Teacher Tao said that my voice is good. Our show had been selected for competition. If we won, we can compete in the city. Can you buy for me a pair of leather shoes? Are you listening? Teacher Tao also say... Why don't you go back home after school? You keep bothering me for this and that. Nuan! Nuan! My mum beats me too. It's just a pair of shoes... When I've the money, I'll buy it for you. Let's go. Troupe master! My child had starved herself for a night. I beg you, you said my child had potential, would you please take her with you? You don't need to pay her wages, just provide her foods and lodging. Your daughter certainly has potential. She will have a conducive enviroment to train in but I can't just take her along like that. When we have the next intake... At that time I wished that Nuan can follow the troupe. I can't really bear to see her dejected face. If I were that handsome acrobat, I'll definitely take her along no matter what, but I'm not that acrobat. And he's not me. Nuan...I understood! What it meant to be in love. We were both love-lorn. Both of us felt bitter. Why don't you eat more? Enough, I'm full. The weather in the city should be cooler. It's alright! The interior is not very airy. Our place here is different. The winter is not that cold. Nuan, do you still remember that year autumn? It was snowing, It seldom snow now. The both of us ran happily to the ancestral shrine to frolic in the snow. We played for the whole day. Yeah...right! I remember at that time, we stayed out until very late. The cotton shoe's that my mum made for me, was soaked right through. That's right. We then ran to Auntie Chang's house. I asked you to dry my shoe's for me but I've never imagined that you would burnt a hole in it. I was so scared that I dare not return home. You were crying and kicking up a fuss. I'm forced to compensate you a pair of shoes. And I've to take off my shoes for you. Are you still teasing me? It's so shameful. New pair of leather shoes. Mum has a new pair of leather shoes. Mum's has a new pair of leather shoes. How can you be so naughty? You'll damage mum shoes. Sis, the worms have all gone into a cocoon. Yeah, it's the last batch. After selling this last batch of cocoon, you're going for match-making. You think so? We'll have a day off in the city after selling this batch of cocoon. Okay! Remember to take me along. During class, that boy Tawei didn't pay much attention to what's written on the blackboard. He just turn around and kept staring at you. Let him stare. I'll not look for a husband from the village. Marriage is once in a lifetime, why not marry further away from here? She's not happy again. Looks like that guy is not going to come for her. He's from the city, surely he'll look down on us. Nuan likes to blabber about them, see what's happen now? Nuan! Nuan!! I've been looking for you. They're here! They're here! They're having new intakes. Come quick and register yourself. I'll write for you the intoduction resume. Seat carefully. Nuan, why don't you give it a try? The troupe is not from the city. If you qualified, you can go and worked in the city. Wouldn't that be nice? I just want to try the troupe from the city. He haven't been here for more than a year. I guess he had already forgotten about you. No way! Why is there no news from him then? Maybe there's no fresh intake at the moment. Yeah, I bet. No! You just don't understand. They'll not be coming anymore. They will! He told me himself. He'll surely come to fetch me. He's lying to you. No! Don't be foolish. He looks down on us. Nuan! I wanna give you a present. What's that? Take a guess? I don't know. Have a look-- It's pretty looking. My brother asked someone to buy it from the city. My mum said it's too pretty. It'll be a waste if she were to wear it. I took it from my mum. She knew what I was thinking. Without another word, she just gave it to me. I want to give it to you. Jinghe... Give me a push. C'mon! I wanna push you up all the way to heaven. Bride and groom exchange drink. Aiyah... Everyone is in a joyful mood except you. What is it to you? Don't pretend to be a fool. You're always like that, letting other tease you. If you don't wanna see, just go away. Am I bothering you? Don't wait for him anymore. He had already forgotten about you. He said that, he'll never forget me. Then why doesn't he show up? If he's not coming this year, he'll be here the next. If he's not here by next year, he'll come the following year. If he comes to fetch me, I'll marry him. Don't you keep on day-dreaming. Even if you agreed to marry him and brought along 200 catties of pork as bridal gift, he'll still not want you. He'll only love you for awhile, what's so grand about it then. I can and I'm willing. Why are you still waiting for him? Nuan, why don't you just speak nicely to your dad? Just complete your high school education, and after that, we can take the university entrance exam together. We still can go to the city. Why should you wait for him? If he really doesn't show up, what're you gonna do about it? I'll marry you if he doesn't show up. I don't want! Are you feeling belittle? Nuan! I really liked you. I'll take good care of you. I'm a man of my words. I've already told you before, if he doesn't show up, then I'll marry you. But you must finished your university examination. That was the first time that I felt Nuan body on me, and that was also the only time. At that moment itself I don't want to argue with her over him, but there're no other choice. She should understand her own emotions. It would help our stagnant situation. I know that I need to be more courageous. Hugging onto her bravery, I don't want to be a replacement in her heart for that acrobat. The swinging helps. It urged me to be more courageous. Shielding my fear, increasing my prowess. I wish that I could just swing on forever, to be able to really fly. I've finally managed to get into the university. When I held the acceptance letter in my hand, my thought was only on Nuan. All the secrets and emotions held within my heart, I'll be able to pour it out to her. I'm used to walking here. Someone will see us. Jinghe. I wonder how's life will be like at the university? I have no idea. Since it's in the city, must be different from here. I've told people numerous times, on the day that I left the village to go to the university, with all villagers coming to see me off, there was a slight detail missing. At that time, Nuan was around. After the accident, our relationship got closer. I immersed myself into my study. If I can pass the university exams, I can help to achieve her dreams. In other words, fulfilled her dreams on her behalf. I've faith in myself. and Nuan trusted me too. Uncle... I'll definitely come and fetch Nuan. You're talking nonsense. Uncle... - I-- - Study hard! I will help Nuan to attend university. Nuan. The letter is in the envelope, I don't have the money for the stamps. You must reply my letter. Let's go. C'mon. Jinghe... I don't matches you. Your promises... are you regretting it? I'm worried that in future the one regretting is you and not me. You don't trust me? If the 3 letters that you left for me-- and I didn't reply... then you can forget about me. Nuan! Reply my letters!! Nuan... I should be leaving. If you required any assistance, you can look for me. The both of you take good care. He shouldn't mistreat you. I'm leaving then. Yau, come here. I'm leaving. Jinghe! Wait! I don't know how to use it, just take it away. Nuan. Nuan... when I look at you, I remember the times when we're together. Come back and visit me. I'm happy with what I have. Nuan, in this world the one debt that I owe the most, is to you. Nonsense! I'm well taken care of. What's better than having your own children? Nuan... I...I've forgotten you. You didn't! You came back, so how could you've forgot about me? Nuan. Jinghe-- just take the umbrella away, I need to go on home. It's not too difficult to understand what happen next. Nuan hadn't awaken and was living in her past dreams. The only difference now was... the one she's waiting for is me. Letter! Jinghe, don't be so sad. Teacher Chau, even if you came to fetch her, how things may have turn out might not be so rosy either. I'm slowly getting used to living in the city. Furthermore, there are more important matters that required my attention. She influenced my feelings for Nuan. No longer do I cared that Nuan is waiting back home for me. Later on, I did not received any letter from her. I know that Nuan's afraid of rejection. Deep within my heart, I'm secretly glad that I did not received any of her letters, making me feel at ease. I don't want to hear any more news regarding her. The reality of life changes me. Nuan experienced once more the futily of unreturned love. I promised to fetch her, but I didn't. In a flash, 10 years had gone by. Why don't you tell me? I've never blame you! What's the point of telling me now? Yau! Take it! Where's your mum? They quarrel! Nuan. You better be leaving. Come Yau! Return the umbrella to uncle. I purposely bring it for her and to bide you farewell. Let me see you off. It's not necessary. Is he in the house? I'll get him. No need. Is he..he alright? He's alright. If you need any help in future, you must look for me. Nuan... I'm still the same Jinghe! Bring your kid along when you're free and back the next time. For sure. Can you tell him please that the next time I'm back, I'll bring him Beijing finest wine. Nuan... My dad wants you to take us both away. My dad wants you to take us both away. When you grow up, I'll definitely come and fetch you to study in the city. I'll be sure to come and fetch you. My promises is my only regret. Human make mistakes. But it's not everyone who will have the opportunity to right ones wrong. I can be considered fortunate, I tried to suppress my memories. A person who don't want to return to his village, no matter how, also can't escape from his first love. Come to think of it, 'the mute' is fortunate. My worries are my comfort. What the mute gave Nuan, I might not be able to... that's to say Nuan is lucky.
