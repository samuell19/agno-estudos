I look ahead full of hope And take my chances for better or for worse I charge at every obstacle in my way And pour my blood and sweat into song! I stand proud and feel the wind tugging at my sleeves I come and go alone, and bend for nothing While youth sparks in my heart and soul I brave suffering In the search for new heights I remain true to myself Pass on my song to everyone! Leave the judgment to those who understand... Quickly, come help! How's Hung Sam? - Drag him up first. - Sa Mang! Sa Mang! - Sa Mang's dead! - We've arrived in Hong Kong. Before, when 'Brother' Sam Pau was here, we ate lavish meals, saw real landscapes. But now, we're just like stray dogs! Who did this to us? Ma Yu-Lung! - We're going to dismember him! - Good. We 'brothers' swear to God. Violate this oath, be like this braid. Officer Chun, good morning. - This way. - Officer Chun, good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, good morning. Please come in and sit. The usual? - The usual. - Thanks. - The bill. - The bill. They'll spend roughly eighteen months in prison. 'Brother Tiger' has already compensated their families. Waiter, the bill! The reporters? They're upstairs drinking tea with Ma Chat. You can begin anytime. Order something to eat. The goods are upstairs, I'll show them to you. - Sit for a moment. - Take your time. - Don't move! Robbery! - Robbery! Don't move! Don't be foolish! Robbery! Rob... - Don't move! - That's about enough! Let's go! Robbery! Robbery! Check it out. Halt, police! Reporting. - Lock them up. - You two, check it out. - Officer Chun, Officer Chun... - Hey, Chan Chik! - We're from the Hong Kong Daily. - What a coincidence. - First, take a picture. - Together... - Oh, no need for that... - Officer Chun, we heard about the robbery. The two thieves were caught by you. Did you get a tip-off? No, I patrol the Three Rings every day. Officer Chun, people call you 'Three Rings Chun'. Is that because you're boss of Sheung Wan, Chung Wan, and Sai Wan? No, everyone exaggerates about me. How many of fences are these thieves going to be charged with? Robbery, assaulting an officer; roughly eighteen months. Take a picture. Put your hand on his shoulder. Reporting. The jewellery shop owner is dead. Will they be executed by firing squad? - Murderers should pay with their lives. - What...? I did what you told me to do. - Don't send me to the firing squad! - Take them back. Halt! I only got $300 compensation, I didn't agree... You... Resisting arrest, fleeing. Collect the corpses. Officer Chun, look this way. Do you have any opinions on this matter? Three Rings Chun fabricates these cases. Everyone's already heard about it. Only now it's clear as day. If you hadn't pressed him to handle more cases, would Three Rings Chun have fabricated them? Nor would the Three Rings be managed by him. In the Chinese police, he's the only one who can carry a gun. No wonder he's so arrogant. - I've always been against Chinese cops carrying guns. - Then are you against Chinese cops getting their salary? I think the need to carry guns depends on the environment. Chinese, Indian, and British policemen should be treated equally. Their salaries should be the same, too! We'll discuss that some other time. How do we handle the matter of Three Rings Chun? He now supervises all three Rings at the same time. It's not that easy to fire him. We dispose of him slowly. First, ask him to hand over Sai Wan. - But who can take his place? - I'd like to recommend someone. He's already carried out a very successful mission: Project A. Take them back to camp. - Uncle Ha, I'm afraid I'm not capable. - Nobody knows, but it's worth trying. It's just a change of environment. Go ahead. - This medal is in recognition of your active service. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Commissioner. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Besides awarding you this medal... - The Security Secretary wishes to lighten your workload. - That's not necessary. - They say, don't exhaust a hardworking bull. - Yes. So, we've decided take one of your Three Rings, and replace you with someone else. There's a new batch of guns coming. Your gun has been in use for so long, I want to check it for you. See if you need to exchange it for a new one. Sergeant Ma Yu-Lung reporting. Sergeant Ma, from today you will help Inspector Chun maintain law and order in Sai Wan. This is your warrant. As of now, Inspector Chun is your colleague. Anything you don't understand, ask him. Please advise me, Inspector Chun. Congratulations. I hope in future that law and order in Sai Wan will be made better by dynamic young men. Find me if you need anything. Inspector Chun, though you may have lost one district, the Security Secretary will see that you gain another. You're being given a developing ring to manage. Where is it? Telegraph Bay! Thank you, thank you. The corruption and incompetence of the Manchu Government has impoverished our people. - Turning Chinese people into a second-class race. - Mister, buy a flower? If we want to save China, we should raise our heads in front of foreigners. To make all Chinese people have a good life, we must support the revolution. Overthrow the Manchu, work as one in order to save China. Doctor Sun has already established the Revive China Society in Honolulu. The revolution can't be made of empty promises. There must be practical action. Action requires weapons, and we need the money to buy them. Police. Thanks for your support. Mister, buy a flower. San-San! Regina! Stop the car. - I've been looking for you for ages. - Regina, were you looking for me? - Where are you going? - I'm going to Sai Wan. - Get in the car first. - OK. My cousin Chau Ling, my classmate Regina. - I've never seen you before. - She just came from the Mainland. Really? My father's throwing a birthday party for me next week, you should come. Your birthday party? Wow! What an occasion! - Chau Ling, you must come, too. - Yes, cousin, you too. - I don't have a dress to wear... - You can wear hers. Right, I have many dresses. - Mister, buy a flower to save the nation? - I'm busy. I'll buy one. 'Brother Dragon' is so patriotic. Shame on me. I'll buy one, too! - Good. - Me too, I'll buy one! Thank you very much. - I'm very touched. I'll buy one, too! - How much? Sir, if everyone is as patriotic as you, we can save China. Yes, true. Thanks, mister. - Hey, miss. Where do you usually sell flowers? - I sell them here and there. Have a bun! - What's up? - The police. Hide the boxes. You! You're spreading rumours, disturbing the peace, and racketeering, am I right? - What evidence do you have? - The flowers in your hand are evidence. They're wearing the flowers you sold. You men are my witnesses. - Did they sell those flowers to you? - No! What? I ask you, what's the meaning of each man wearing a flower? We've been corresponding with these two young ladies for a long time. We arranged to meet today, but feared we wouldn't be recognised. So, they each carry two baskets of flowers, and each of us wears a flower. Right, we've been waiting ages. Hold the flowers up a bit higher. - Come... sit down. - Come sit. - You look prettier than your letters. - Let me introduce you. This is Mr A. I'm Mr B. He's Mr C, he's Mr D. Sit, sit... Is it illegal to meet pen pals? You've got guts, playing with us! I'm telling you, don't let us catch you again! You drown an ant in piss, I'll sue you for animal cruelty! Have some tea, have some tea. What I hate most is those slave dogs helping foreigners bully their own countrymen. Right, they think wearing green makes them special. An abuse of power, wouldn't you agree? That's not it. Some cops are genuine in pursuing law and order and protecting the people. - Pity I haven't yet seen any. - Haven't seen any? You've got four in front of you. We wouldn't oppress our countrymen. - So, you guys are cops? - Excuse me. Miss... China will depend on passionate people like you to save it. Don't forget your cash boxes. Brother Dragon, if they didn't look so pretty, would you have been so kind as to help them? - Waiter, the bill. - Coming! Those cops just now were really nice. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have known how to get away. Good men don't become cops. - How many flowers have you sold? - Quite a lot. You're doing fine. - And you? - I still have a lot... - Robbery... - Robbery... Robbery! No you don't! Oh, it's you again? - What's up? - These two men robbed the young ladies' cash boxes. Get out of the way... Young ladies? What young ladies? Out of the way... Don't obstruct, out of the way! They were just here. - What's up? - It's nothing... Take them all in. I'm the duty officer here. Tell me if you have anything to say. - I must see your supervisor. - It's not your turn to speak. - Officer! - What? - We're Brother Tiger's 'brothers'. - Yeah? - You have to abide by the rules. - Yes, yes... - But we didn't rob money from those two girls. - Didn't rob? Then how did you know it was two girls? Shut up! It's not your turn to speak. - Excuse me, is Sergeant Chun in? - Sergeant Chun? Hey, it's all gone. Are you buying as usual? - Buy a dollar. - Buy a dollar? Yes! Hey, these two are looking for Sergeant Chun. Come in. What are you looking at? Come make your statement. Even if you are Brother Tiger's men, you can't break the law. - We didn't! - No? That's weird! - 201, take them out the back door. - Let's go, don't get in the way. - Well? Is it our turn to speak yet? - You have something to say? Go ahead. - I want to see your supervisor. - See my supervisor for what? I want to complain about the misconduct of certain officers. Oh, great... Ah San, take him to the big room. Hey, only one at a time. Wait your turn. You, come with me. Ah Chung! Come on! - Where's your supervisor? - This is our supervisor. You want to lodge a complaint about officer misconduct? Complain to him. When you tricked me back at the tea-house, you weren't counting on this, eh? Ah, enough guts to avoid me? Help! Come on, help me quick! Stop playing, stop playing... I give up... Don't be reckless! I'm the new sergeant for Sai Wan, Ma Yu-Lung. This is my warrant. So, it's Officer Ma? It's a misunderstanding. If you think that as police officers you can use the authority of public office to avenge private wrongs... and shield criminal elements for your own interests, well, that's truly a misunderstanding. - Officer Ma, don't listen to people talking nonsense. - I saw it with my own eyes. Putting on official airs? The new broom sweeping clean? - Big deal, I quit! - Right. You think you can do our jobs, too? So you've never made a mistake in your life? You want us all to quit? Big deal, I quit! Now, what's the big deal? Officer Ma is good for us. Officer Ma, you're a magnanimous superior. Don't blame them. As long as everyone does well in future, I won't take today to heart. It's a new dawn now. Welcome Officer Ma! Welcome! Officer Ma, this is our welcoming gift. - All the 'brothers' have a share in this? - Yeah... Sai Wan's ill-gotten gains aren't bad. If the top's taken care of, it's convenient for everyone. Oh, but one officer didn't want to participate. Who? Name's Ho Chi-Ging, he hasn't come back yet from his beat. When he gets back, ask him to come see me. Yes. Officer Ma, if you have any instructions, by all means speak up. Alright. - Officer Ma, your flower's beautiful. - Oh, thanks! This one's been wanted for three years and never caught. He's been involved in several recent cases. Hey, proves he's still in Sai Wan. - This case is obviously another one of his. - So, they can't arrest him, or they don't dare? Officer Ma, I'm Ho Chi-Ging. Why did so many officers contribute to my welcome gift, but not you? I don't take bribes, so I couldn't afford to. - So, the others are taking bribes, then? - I didn't say that. If you don't wise up, you won't stay in this job long. I joined the police force to uphold the law, and protect the people. If I have to exploit my authority to take dirty money, well, I'd rather quit. You sound like an honest man. Sai Wan has so many unsolved cases, fugitives that haven't been caught. What have you done? Everyone knows Sai Wan's worst gangster is Au Sam-Fu. It's not that I don't want to arrest him... I just don't have the ability. He has many subordinates. The fugitives here are all members of his gang. So, where's Au Sam-Fu's den? Sai Wan's casinos, opium dens, brothels - he shares in them all. As for his headquarters, they're at the Bo Luk Hotel. Call all the brothers, have them assemble here tomorrow morning. Brothers, when everyone does their police duties well, I'll be happy. Better than inviting me to tea. Who here wants to live next door to a brothel? Who here wants their children addicted to gambling? Opium smoking that causes constant arguments, to the extent that families end up bankrupt or dead. If you don't want it, I don't think the people of Sai Wan want it either. But now in Sai Wan, there are so many opium dens, brothels, and casinos. Who opened them? I think you know better than I do. It's our duty to protect the public. So now let's go eradicate Sai Wan's curse, and arrest the Tiger of Sai Wan. Let's go. Officer Ma, leave it to the young men. I'll stay here as duty officer. - Sir, I request leave. - For what reason? - Me, too. - One at a time, for what reason? - My wife's giving birth. - My sister's giving birth. - What a coincidence. - My sister is his wife! - My wife is his sister! - Yeah! - Reporting. I resign. - For what reason? My mother only has one son. I don't want to die before I have children. - You go for me, OK? - Me too, Sir. We get paid so little, it's not worth dying for. I quit. - I also quit. - I also quit. I understand. Today's action is cancelled. Dismissed. Brother Dragon! Hey, come on. You know, it's really boring working with them. Something happens, nobody takes responsibility. Now Brother Dragon's been forced to cancel his plan. Not forced. Cancelling the plan must've been Brother Dragon's idea. Right, maybe he changed his mind? Found someone to spy on the enemy first. No. He said at the start it was just a test, to learn who's afraid to die and who's brave. Now we know, the operation is cancelled. Don't you agree? Right. We've been with Brother Dragon so long, you think we don't know his game? Ridiculous! I don't have a choice now. It's inappropriate to joke. We just got here. If this matter isn't taken care of, how can we continue on here? Right. In future, I daren't speak out loud. 'Big Mouth', help me deliver a letter to the Navy Commandos. - Yes! - Oh, are we asking the Navy to take us back? When it gets dark, we'll arrest the Tiger of Sai Wan. Gentleman, we haven't sat together in a long time. Cheers, everyone. Big Brother Tiger, there's something you have to tell us? Right, I just saw Three Rings Chun. He supervised the Three Rings, one of which, Sai Wan, has just been taken over. We'll wait here for Big Mouth, you take a look around. Thanks. - We changed clothes, why are they staring? - Hey, isn't your hat on backwards? - Is that better? - A little. - How do you tie this knot? - Like this. Never mind! Let's find something to eat first. Brother Tiger, Three Rings Chun lost Sai Wan. Who will inform for us in future? Since he's spoken out, we're going to have to help him. It's quite simple. Call on a few brothers, wait for him to go out, then give him a good thrashing. Don't wait for him to come out, find him at the police station. What's this guy like? I really want to know, is he superhuman? Big Mouth, Big Mouth... I found Ying-Ying. She said, the Navy went out on manoeuvres, and doesn't know when they'll be back. So, are we going or not? - Some things we must do by ourselves. - Right, else we'd be ashamed to return to Sai Wan. There's no movement inside. Eh, what did you just say that kid's name was? - Ma Yu-Lung. - Ma Yu-Lung? Right, he's the one that led the Naval strike against Law Sam-Pau. - May I ask which of you is Au Sam-Fu? - I am. We're the police. I'd like you to come back to the station. - Back to the station? Who are you? - I'm Sai Wan Sergeant, Ma Yu-Lung. You're now suspected of three murders, four robberies, an arson, and three cases of serious assault. This is an arrest warrant. - Am I so mightily impressive? - Let me see. How unlucky! Brother Dragon, we're just leaving? - Stop the music. - Stop playing, stop playing... All of you, listen. We're the police. Those with no business here, leave now. Go! I'm a cop, nothing to worry about. Go, everyone go... Ma Yu-Lung. I haven't come looking for you, but you came to arrest me? Ah, so you're the one they call Ma Yu-Lung? You must arrest me. Those two cases in Causeway Bay? I did them. Conveniently, you can arrest me at the same time. Because in a moment I'm going to kill a cop! Ma Yu-Lung... don't you know how to write the word 'death'? Everyone has one life. I'm not immortal. Nor are you untouchable. Come back to the station with me. Reporting! Reporting. The Third Firearms Squad has arrived outside, and is awaiting orders. Reporting! We have thirty team members outside awaiting orders. Ready to charge in. - Huh? We have so many men coming? - What the...? Why haven't you ordered them to charge in yet? Waiting for luck to head our way? - Really? Why don't you order them in? - Really? I'll order them to charge in. I'll order them all to charge in! No need. No need to pretend. The ones coming to arrest you tonight are all within your eyesight. You have guts! I'm not wondering if you can arrest me. I'm worried if you'll be able to walk out that door. - Close the door. - Yes! - Don't be afraid... - Don't be afraid... What're you looking at? - Don't be afraid! - Don't be afraid! - What do we do now? - What to do? Find someone to carry you out. Watch out! Behind you! Damn kid, think you can fight? I'll suffocate you! Why, you! Arrest me? Only if you have nine lives, otherwise, you'll soon be dead! Grab your ears and kneel down. - Go up and get him. - Yes! Aren't you dead yet, Ma Yu-Lung? My name's 'Brave' Hung. Recognise me? Forward! Go up, surround them. Brother Dragon, are you alright? Sergeant Ma, what a coincidence. Carrying out a mission? Is it going well? In the course of the arrests, a slight resistance was encountered. Really? That's simple. Take them all back. Hold it! What? Are we pirates? Are we smugglers? You're water snakes! On what charge are you arresting us? I didn't say I was going to arrest you, but I suspect there are pirates here. Sergeant, continue with your mission. Don't mind me. Lock those two up. Brothers, take all the others back. Find out who's a pirate and who's a citizen. Come on, come on... Lock them up, take them all back. Dismissed. - Take them away. - Yes. - Are you guys really OK? - Better if you'd come earlier! - Let's go! - Thanks. Thank you very much. They were out to sea on manoeuvres. I notified them and they rushed right over. - Ma Yu-Lung! If not for the water snakes... - Let's go! Hold it! Let them both go. If you two can walk out before me, I won't arrest you. You guys leave first. Come on. Lock them up! Still eager to win? Child's play, I've already done your job. - How can it be your turn? - I understand. Don't forget, the Navy's your home. When you come back we'll go fishing. Brother Dragon, Dad says, land is different from the sea... Especially in this area, you have to take care at work. Take them all back under arrest. Well? - It's Ma Yu-Lung. - Yeah. - Chop him! - We'll chop him up! You're out of your mind! How can you chop so many people? - I heard, they suspect there are pirates here. - See, I'm right. Our whereabouts has been discovered. How can we chop him? - What do we do if we don't chop him? - Now, go back to sleep. - Where are we going to sleep? - Sleep where...? Find a place to sleep. Don't chop him tonight... wait for the chance. - What a coincidence! - Yeah. Want a cigarette? - You're welcome. - Officer Chun, moving your things now? I was going to move them, but am afraid I'll have to move them back. - Really? That's great. Do you know when? - I'm sure it won't be long. - This partition isn't easy to sit in. - Yeah, not easy to sit in. Find a good place to put it, so we don't have trouble moving it back later. Sergeant, come outside. Hey, Sergeant Ma! I've wanted this lot behind bars forever, and now you've made it happen. Thank you for helping me. Commissioner Tung chose the right man. - I'm flattered. - Officer Chun. Shut up! - Don't pretend you don't know us. - Lock them up! - Hey, you dump us now that we're of no use? - Get them out! - Hey, Officer Chun! - Don't argue. Did you hear me? Get them out of here! Did you hear me? Get them out of here! 201. Take Au Sam-Fu to the Serious Crimes detention room. 267, 357. Take Wong (Sam-Hung to the second detention room. 282. Take a couple of fellows to the Bo Luk Hotel and seal off the scene. Sergeant Chun. Detain the others for the time being. Charge them if there's enough evidence. The remaining officers on duty step up the pursuit of fugitives. - Understood? - Understood! Take action immediately. Take action immediately. You've worked hard. Take a break. I'll leave first. Officer Ma, go and rest a while. I'll bring you a cup of nice coffee. Sir, what about your things? Where do I put them? Who are you asking? Get rid of them. Sergeant Ma, the Security Secretary was very pleased with the operation at the Bo Luk Hotel. Don't thank me yet. There's no medal for you just yet. Now, remember. Don't be complacent. - I won't be complacent. - Then I won't need to remind you. Next week, it's the Security Secretary's daughter's birthday. - You'll have to be careful. - I'll be careful. Caution alone isn't enough. You'll have to think about it. If you were Three Rings Chun, what would you do? If anything goes wrong, you'll get the blame. Thanks for the reminder, Sir. You must dress neatly for the birthday party. Get the brothers some new suits. Take money from the treasury. How can one rat be enough for us to eat? - Ah Kei, where are you going? - I'm going out to rob! I want to eat a lavish meal. Why should I eat a sewer rat? - What are we afraid of? - We're not afraid of anything. We came here to chop up Ma Yu-Lung. If we go out, the cops will find us. Don't tell me that to avenge Brother Sam Pau we can't endure a little hardship. Can it be used to boil soup? I haven't had meat broth in a while. Everyone, I've already promised Three Rings Chun. At the Security Secretary's daughter's birthday party, I'll help him steal a diamond necklace. Why would you do that? We don't need to pay attention to their colonial bureaucratic struggles. The most important thing is to know what's good for our revolutionary cause. He's a big dealer, and can help us solve the problem of arms. Does this Three Rings Chun know your background? When I was smuggling arms, I already crossed paths with him. - He thinks I'm just a thief. - Alright, let's go ahead. Also, before I returned from Canton, Dr Sun asked me to let you know... In order to assassinate the Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi... Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi has already sent several imperial assassins to Hong Kong to hunt us down. Inform Chau Ling and Yee San. Tell them to be careful when selling flowers. Meeting adjourned. You come with me. I found it, I found it. - What did you find? - Fish and Lobster. - Fish? - Lobster? - Shells. - Shells? Fish is also good! What did you find out? Usually, they each have their own den, but I haven't yet found out where. However, Chau Ling is responsible for selling flowers, and shows up once every few days. It would be better for us to start with her. This time, I'm going to catch them in one fell swoop. I know, I know... Wow! It's beautiful! - I'm not going dressed like this. - Don't be afraid. - It's not good. - I said, there's a change of dress for you. Ah, Mr B! Invitation's just for one. - This invitation's just for you. - My cousin wanted to come with me, couldn't you...? Oh, yes. I just ask too many questions. - Hi, Ah San! You're here! - Why are you so late? - Come on. - Been waiting on you for a while. Hey, what took you so long? - You go and have fun. - Hurry, we'll go in first. Why are you so late? Hurry, come upstairs and change your dress. This gentleman said she couldn't come in without an invitation. - Who are you men? - We're policemen, responsible for tonight's security. What is your name? His name's Ma Yu-Lung. Ma Yu-Lung, I forgot to post an invite to my friend. - Can you bend the rules? - Of course. Thank you. - Thank you, Sergeant Ma. - Let's go up. - Sorry. - Never mind. - Inform Big Mouth, keep an eye on those two. - Right. - Who are they? - He's Man Tin-Ching, the woman I don't know. Keep an eye out for strangers. Thank you. - That lady is very beautiful. Any of you know her? - I don't know her. - Then, no one can help introduce me? - I'll help introduce you. Not a friend of yours? - You listen clearly. - OK. Please... The diamond necklace is in the safe on the second floor behind the warship painting. Breathe in... That's enough. Got it! - Wearing these clothes... is so exhausting. - Wearing these clothes, that's how it is. Let me pick one. - Don't move. - OK, OK! - Help me pick a pretty one. - It's done. Miss Bak, you said you grew up in Shanghai, but you have no trace of the accent. Maybe not, but you don't have to have athlete's foot to be an athlete. - Excuse me. - As you wish. Miss Bak is most witty. I like to be friends with witty people. He says that to all the ladies. You mustn't believe him. Miss Bak was discovered by the Security Secretary first. You look wonderful in this new dress. Don't just stare at the girls. - Daddy, tell me, am I beautiful tonight? - Tonight is the most beautiful you've ever been. - What about my dress? - I was talking about your dress! Let me have your first dance. Maestro... Miss, please may I have this dance? - Go on, it's fun. - Miss, may I ask you to dance? I've never tried dancing with so many people all together. Daddy, are you having a good time tonight? You look beautiful tonight. Of course I'm happy. You're not looking at me. - Where do you live? - Gough Street. There are many villains in Hong Kong, you have to be careful. There are so few good people in Hong Kong, being able to know you is my good fortune. As Police Commissioner, don't you feel that Hong Kong's law and order is lacking? - Really? I don't think so. - What do you usually do? Mostly drink coffee in my office. In a moment, you'll see me leave the hall. You and Chau Ling find a way to get to the second floor and distract the guards' attention. Don't worry, we'll play it by ear. You say the police are doing their job, so why do we have robberies every day? If there's no crime, we'd have no reason to ask for a raise. I wonder, can I invite you to tea? Mister, did you just eat an onion? The Security Secretary's office is opposite his daughter's room. - I'll go up from outside, you provide support up there. - Alright. Usually, I like to go shopping, see Chinese Opera. Also, when I have free time at home I paint. Paint? I enjoy painting, too. - What are you doing? - My dress popped open. What's the matter? - I'll take you upstairs to change. - Excuse me. - Why hasn't anyone exchanged partners with us? - You don't like dancing with me? - Oh no, I just want to go to the washroom. - You want to go to the washroom? - I'll take you. - Thank you. Come, I'll sew it up for you. Don't move, my eyes are blurring. - It's so hot! - I don't think so. - Hot? Open the window. - OK, I'll open it. I checked. The invitation's real, but I don't know from where it was sent. The dance floor's been searched. I don't know whether... Help me look at this dress, isn't it beautiful? - Not bad. - That one? - Don't make a noise. - What's wrong? - Nothing, you have a good figure. - Really? I don't think so. - Don't mess around in my classmate's home. - It's alright. What's the best one to wear? Go! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Please come in. Daddy, is this dress pretty enough to wear when I cut the cake? You should ask my new friend, Miss Bak. - You look pretty whatever you wear. - Really? - The dress you just had on was pretty. - Then I'll just put that one back on. Young women... Did you see...? I didn't see anything, but you saw all of my daughter! Do you think that security can just charge in anywhere? Wouldn't you say he's too much? Hey, it's pretty, it's pretty... Don't take too long to choose. My bedroom is next door. I wonder what the most important man in Hong Kong's bedroom is like? Hurry up, hurry up! They're waiting for me to cut the cake! Let's go! Your room is so big. Since Regina's mother died, the room seems too big by half. Please... - Wow! Your study is beautiful. - Merely the office of a civil servant. Except for my private paintings, this home, and all other antiques are government property. So, it wouldn't be possible to give me something? I just bought these paintings, haven't yet displayed them. Can I take a look? You want to see? Alright, you're most welcome. I bought this painting in London. I liked it as soon as I saw it. I like it, too. Another painting you may prefer. Let me show you. Besides appreciating the paintings of others, do you like painting yourself? Yes, I like painting very much. But there's not yet a painting I can show anyone. - And you? Don't you like painting? - I paint Chinese landscapes. Chinese landscapes I like very much. But I don't know enough about them. I still have two watercolour paintings, where did I put them? Let me look. - Not in here. Maybe it's in an unopened box? - If you can't find them, just leave it. Don't worry. In any case, the cake hasn't been cut. I don't have them. How could that be? Perhaps they haven't been mailed yet? Stop right there! Hold it! What's wrong? - What is it? - A thief! What's the matter? - What are you doing here? - Someone's stealing! Damn it! Wow! The cake is so beautiful. - Beautiful. - Yeah. - The cake is so big. - Yeah... It's beautiful. I'm sorry! Don't you move! I'm sorry, everyone. - I'm now going to arrest you. - Why? - Me? - What is it, Dragon? Don't pretend to be a fool. I saw you steal from the Security Secretary's room. Someone entered my study and stole the necklace I bought for Regina's birthday. - That's him. - You say you saw me steal? Do you have evidence? Dragon, to catch a thief you have to search for the loot. I'm sure he has an accomplice. He's not stupid enough to keep the loot on him. Dragon, you have no evidence of theft. Be careful of people suing your pants off. Guests, something has taken place that none of us expected. For peace of mind, I'm sure all guests present wouldn't mind being searched by police officers. - So, we're to be frisked? - If one is innocent, a frisk is nothing. Needless to say, it must be me first. But, for the sake of fairness, I hope Sergeant Ma can be proven innocent before searching me. Right. - Inspector Chun, you help with the search. - I think the Commissioner would do a better job himself. OK, I'll do it myself. - This diamond is part of the necklace. - How come it's on you? Could someone have planted it on him? Sergeant Ma's acting is truly superb. Ladies and gentlemen, what you just saw was tonight's performance piece. Sergeant Ma acted as if it were for real, making everyone anxious for him. But now the performance is over. - Daddy! - I wanted to surprise you. - I was scared to death! - Cut the cake. - Was that show just now really prearranged? - I'm no longer joking. Where's the necklace? - I really don't know. - Why was the diamond in your pocket? Explain that to me. - So, that wasn't a show? - You really thought that was a show? I never thought about it. So what should we do now? I should be asking you that question! What do you think we should do? - Detain him. - Dragon, he... I'm not talking to you. I want you to clear up tonight's affair as soon as possible. Take him away. - Make a wish before you cut the cake. - Yes. Was it you who caused trouble for Ma Yu-Lung the other night? - I'm unclear on this matter, but he is innocent. - Actually, he's a good man. But we're doing this for the benefit of the nation state. Trust me. Sticky rice dumplings! - Sticky rice dumplings? - OK. You eat them stuffed, or...? Cousin...? Cousin? Cousin, don't scare me! - Cousin... - Hey, San-San, what's up? - My cousin's disappeared! - Where did she disappear? - By my side, she suddenly disappeared. - Suddenly disappeared? She won't say anything. There's only this letter. Look for this address, see if you can find her accomplices. Yes. - Remember, don't alert the Hong Kong Police. - Understood. Hey, you brought me out secretly. It's a big deal if the Commissioner sees us. If you find the necklace, it'll be alright. You think Chau Ling's disappearance has something to do with this case? That night, Chau Ling danced with Man Tin-Ching. Officer Chun, I have orders to take him out on a case. Approved by the Commissioner. Is this your first day on the job? You forgot the handcuffs. Sorry. I'll uncuff you back at the station. - What're you doing? - You think this is a diamond necklace? Go find the Warden. When you take the prisoner back to jail, I want you to pass the seaside lane. Then you won't have to be Warden anymore. - Simple as that? - It's as simple as that. That's good. Anyone there? You don't know? I hope she's back home. Don't make a noise! Cousin...? Cousin? Oh dear, cousin's not back yet. I wonder who snatched her? Some things are better not to know. Cousin? - So, it's you two? - Yeah. - Yeah, have you heard from your cousin? - She's not back yet. Have you any news? - It's still under investigation. - Wait a minute, I'm changing my clothes. - Who is it? - It's Ma Yu-Lung and his colleague Ah Ging. Could it be about the other night? I'm going to hide. Have you found anything out? Not yet, but I think it's to do with the man who stole the diamond necklace that night. - That's right. - Wasn't that down to you? That was the Security Secretary's idea. He didn't want to arouse suspicion. - So, does your cousin know Mr Man? - She doesn't. Please sit. - Good brothers. - Yes. - Aren't you in a hurry? - No hurry. - Didn't you just say it was urgent? - When did I say that? - Ah, yes, very urgent. - Where's the toilet? - Toilet? In the back. - Thanks. - I only have one toilet. - We always pee together. - We've done so since childhood. Thanks. - Right. - Well? - Gone to the toilet. In that case... Hey, I'm going now. You wait a minute, I'm going to change clothes first. - Commissioner Tung. - Commissioner Tung? What's the matter? Lead him out back. I'll leave when I get the chance. Commissioner Tung? - Commissioner Tung. - For you. Thanks. What brings you here? Nothing. Passing on patrol, came up for a seat. - The flowers? - Confiscated from an unlicensed hawker. Nice ambience you've got here. A very nice place indeed! The room where the lady dwells is especially neat. The whole house is very fragrant. - Oh yeah, your two men... - My two men? - What's that about my two men? - Didn't you bring two men with you? More than two, they're all waiting for me downstairs. From now on, I'll patrol this neighbourhood every day to protect you. What's wrong? - Nothing? - I have hiccups. Hiccups? I have a special remedy. - Is it effective? - This is an ancient treatment to cure hiccups. It's alright, it's alright. - Do you feel better? - Much better. Next time you have hiccups remember to use my ancient cure. - Aren't you here with your cousin? - Why don't we arrange the flowers? Flower arrangement? OK. Let me help you. - Where's the tap? - Over there. You know what, I always close the windows when I cook. Are you cooking now? But I'm not cooking now, so no need to close them. Your tap is broken. Gushing on and on... - I'll fix it for you. - Thank you. Don't move. It's alright. A little water won't scare me. You go out first, save your clothes getting wet. I'll take care of it. I'll get you a towel. You can go. I'll look out for you. Excuse me. It's done, but my body's wet. Thank you. So, you're able to repair taps? Right. Before I was Police Commissioner, I was Chief of the Water Department. - My uniform's wet. - No problem, I'll dry it for you. Thank you. What a hero I am! You still haven't left? - Too many greens down there. - The key, the key... Hey, hurry up! San-San! Hey, where are you? The flowers have been arranged. - Where do you want them put? - Living room. By the way, could you dry my clothes, and find me something to wear? What's wrong? - It won't open. - Let me try. Maybe the damp has expanded the wood? Take this. Try this side. It's open. - Is this one alright? - It's fine. - Thanks. - I'll dry iron your clothes. My clothes can't be ironed, they must be air-dried. Doesn't matter. I'm patient. I can wait. It's very uncomfortable. - These...? - These are handcuffs, to lock up villains. If you catch a thief, one lock, and he's locked up. Lock the other on yourself, then he can't go. If there are two thieves and one runs away, so what? Lock him up here, then go find the other thief. He's still here when you get back. He can't get away, right? - The key's in my jacket. - I'll get it for you. Your cousin's back. Inspector Chun! - Three Rings Chun? Tell him I'm not here. - He's here to see me. - Tell him you're not here. - He's seen me! I'm locked up, what do I do? I'll hide first. Now what? I need to find a place to hide. I'm changing my clothes now. - Give me a hand. - Hey, that way! - Never mind. Where to? - Over there! Get in that room. You're killing me! - Hurry up and hide. Come on, hide! - Where should I hide? - Hide under the bed, OK? - Under the bed? - Over here, over here! - Over here? I'll hide the chair first. Inspector Chun doesn't know my chair. Hide yourself first! - I'll hide under here. - Hide under there. Hurry! Don't move. - Sorry, I was changing clothes. - No matter. - Inspector Chun... on routine patrol? - Yes, yes. Not bad ambience here. Well? What are your dissatisfactions with this district? Do you wish to complain? - There's too much to complain about. - Really? Tell me. Don't you think law and order in this district is poor? Last night... It's nothing. - Inspector Chun, please sit. - Thanks. - I'll pour you some tea. - Fine. Oh dear! I forgot to make tea. I'll go and buy some soda. No need, no need. Inspector Chun... don't you have to go to other homes to promote police and community relations? - Yes, yes... in that case, I'm leaving. - OK, OK! Inspector Chun, you take care now! Remember, next time you pass by, don't forget to come see me. Hey... Me? You... Now that Inspector Chun has gone, I'll get going, too. - What are you doing? - I want to kiss you while no one's around. - I don't want to. - Fragrant smell. Hurry up, you're not leaving? The kiss is over, hurry home. Why aren't you leaving yet? I will, or else my men will come looking for me. - Well? - No good, there are two more up there. - Another two people? - Why are there so many people in my house? - I don't understand. - So, what now? Go out first. Where's the key? "Who in Hong Kong are the mightiest? Policemen are the mightiest. "Chasing gunmen without shoes, to quickly catch a thief. "Heroes sent out into the wind and rain, to manage public safety and uphold discipline." "Who in Hong Kong are the mightiest? Policemen are the mightiest! "Shooting gunmen without license, policemen are too big for their boots! "Also, they work part-time and accept housing, even if they charge-in like a crab!" Sing, sing! - "Uncle Biu, why do you have a split moustache?" - "Because of prestige!" - Who's that? - Hurry up and catch him! - Why did you come into my house? - Have you any accomplices? Knock his teeth out! - Stab him, stab him! - Stab him in the heart! - Stab him in the thigh! - Stab him in the ass! Go out! - Don't fight, don't fight... - He's not moving, is he dead? - Still breathing. - Talk or I'll shoot you dead! Don't move! I'm holding two of yours. If you mess around, I'll shoot him! - Your man is in my hands! - Ah Choi, are you alright? - Him? Not dead yet. - OK. We exchange one for one, or I'll kill her now. Take him over there. Ah Choi, are you alright? Don't be reckless! - Cousin... - Quick, get me the key. I was worried about you. I'm an Imperial Bodyguard of the Qing Empire's Forbidden Palace. So, you're not in the Forbidden City protecting the Empress Dowager, you're here to capture people? We were ordered to arrest rebels. You Hong Kong Police can't control us. Hong Kong is a region ruled by law. The laws of Hong Kong are only for common people. How can a man like this speak of law? Lock him up. Here's another one. - Hand them over to the Qing's charge d'affaires. - I've searched everywhere, and nothing. - Why don't you just open it with one shot? - What if I make a mistake and hit my hand? - Then aim. - Hey, lock them up. Hey, if you can't find them, then what do I do? Commissioner, be careful. No need to be so kind. How did you get out? I can pretend not to know, but it's time you went back. Next time I'll change my signature. Commissioner, your hand... My hand is locked to an important exhibit, evidence that these two thieves entered this house. - Your key? Open it. - Yes. I have handcuffs, but no key. Never mind, I'll take them back. Sergeant Ma, even when you're out of prison on a case, you should be back before sundown. I'm taking him back right now. I'll take him back myself. - OK, let's go then. - Come on... Proceed according to plan. Move along, move along... What's there to see? - Sergeant Ma, we're on official business. - Fine. - Sir... - What? Can't you open the handcuffs? I won't run. I told you, I forgot my key. Ma Yu-Lung, today you will die. - Who the hell are you? - We're the ones whose family and home you destroyed. Today, I'm going to chop you into nine pieces! - Hey, your personal vendetta is none of my business. - It's none of your business, get lost! - Hey, you must protect the prisoner. - Your death, your business. - We're going to avenge Brother Sam. - Right! The key, the key? Hey, don't you be reckless! Don't you know he's Three Rings Chun? Right, I'm a Police Chief Inspector. Chief Inspector? Chop regardless! - Go up there! - What? - I said, 'go up there!' - I don't know what you're talking about. A little mutual understanding, OK? Get out of the way... It's tangled. - Policemen are being chopped! - Quick, call the police! This way, this way! Jump over! Hurry up! Hey, don't run! Hurry up... This way, this way! Open the door... - What's the matter? - Something's the matter... Why did you hit me? Block this! - Come on. - I... - Come up! - Outflank them! Go to hell! Die! Hey, there's no way out. This way, this way. Come on. You almost got me killed! This way. Tell me who the hell you are, or I'll kill you with this hatchet! Sweep. Are you for real? - That's two of them. - They're both officers. What're you doing? Hurry up and chase them! - Greens! - Chop? - Too many Greens! - Run! - Bread! - Hey, there's no time. - Bread! - Bread? They've gone. Dismissed! Go back for the identikit. Identikit your head! Hurry up and chase them! - Officer Chun, what province are you from? - Shandong province. - I've never met anyone from Shandong so... - So tall? - So clumsy. - What? Go! Even if you return to Guangzhou, don't be too active outside. - Prince Shun has planted many informants. - I'll be careful. I didn't have time to call my cousin. Please give this letter to her. I hope when we meet again, the revolution will have succeeded. Good. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hey... Three Rings Chun. - Inspector Chun. - Warden, what a coincidence! - What's the matter? - Don't ask, he almost got me killed. - Where are you going? - Back to the prison. Good, take him back for me. Do you have the key? Ask Man and Ah Sing to come. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Ma Yu-Lung... goodbye. - Goodbye. - Waiter, brew a pot of tea. - OK. This doesn't look like the path back to the prison. - But it's very close to someplace else. - Where? Hell. What're you doing? Let me go! What're you doing? Hurry up, hurry up! What're you doing? I'll write in the report, the prisoner jumped into the sea and escaped. Right. - Hey... seems there's something wrong with 'Whale'. - Empty stomach. - How do you know? - Are you hungry? Everybody's hungry! - No, his head's a bit hot. - He's sick and hungry. - All this is surely Ma Yu-Lung's fault. - It's not Ma Yu-Lung, we only have ourselves to blame. If we hadn't gone ashore to chop up Ma Yu-Lung... and had looked for proper jobs, we wouldn't have ended up like this. If you'd said something earlier, of course I'd have stood by your side. - Ma Yu-Lung killed many of our brothers. - He's a marine cop, of course he's going to fight pirates. We're pirates, naturally we plunder ships. Do you think we've killed fewer people? If you'd said this before, I'd be on your side, too. That's what I said! Enough talk of blame, let's see what sickness he has. Hey, what kind of sickness is it? - It's hot and cold. - Ah! It's hot and cold sickness! - Hot and cold sickness? - Let's get some medicine first. Come on... - Thank you for releasing my two men. - What else does the Prince instruct? I came to Hong Kong to capture several murderers who escaped from the Mainland. - Did you get the Hong Kong government's consent? - The bounty on these people is 5,000 silver taels. Oh, I can assist you on behalf of the Hong Kong Police. Inspector Chun's handling of matters is refreshingly straightforward. I didn't expect you to save me. If Three Rings Chun hadn't bribed us to frame you, you wouldn't have been thrown in jail. - In the end, we had to atone for our crime. - Then why did you want to harm me? At that time, we were eager to raise money to buy arms, and promised to steal something for Three Rings Chun. Only later did we find out we unexpectedly harmed a good cop. Now the diamond necklace is...? In one of the books in the Security Secretary's study. Although you hurt me first, you also saved my life. I'm temporarily in your debt. - You're leaving? - Don't worry, I'm not going to tell anyone about you. Revolution is a sacred thing, we needn't fear others knowing. - We're just worried about you. - Me? - You're going back to being a cop? - If I'm not a cop, then what? Join the ranks of our revolution, save the Chinese nation together. If among our comrades there were more people of your ability, we would have a greater chance of success. I'm not going to join you. Are you still mad at us for planting the stolen goods? For the revolution to succeed, we need to accomplish the so-called big things and not bother about trifles. - We're even ready to sacrifice ourselves at any time. - That's the reason I don't want to join you. I'm a man who believes in those 'trifles'. No matter how true or pleasing my goals may sound... I wouldn't, for the sake of my aim, do something unscrupulous like break the law. Actually, I really admire you. Because you're the ones doing great things. I realise that to overthrow the Manchu Cling will require thousands of people to shed blood and lay down their lives. But I daren't ask anyone to do that. Because I don't know what the result of asking so many people to fight to the death will be. That's why I like being a cop. Because I think all human life is important. I want to protect everyone. Even in a country of 400 million people, each person is an individual. If one doesn't like their own life, is there still heart to love their country? I know what you mean. I'll remember what you said. Actually, we're all working for the Chinese people. Only the job is different. That means being a cop is a sacred duty. But in a corrupt colonial government, a good cop won't be allowed to exist. They'll keep on framing you. Because these people exist, I want to stay here even more. - Take care. - Goodbye. Uncle Kuen, she just left me a letter? Why leave in such a hurry? Perhaps she had something important to do? - Thanks, Uncle Kuen. I'm going now. - Alright. - I'm going in. - You're borrowing medicine, not chopping people. - I wonder if I can get it on credit? - Hey, use a nicer tone. Young Uncle? Elder Uncle? Elder Brother? I'd like you to sell me some medicine on credit. - Sorry, we don't do medicine on credit here. - Please, I'm using it to save someone's life. This isn't a mission. If everyone was like you, how would we do business? - Give him credit. - OK. I want to know who you are. Where did I offend you? Or did I wrongfully arrest your friends? Brother Wan, I'm going now. Put his medicine on my account. - Hey, friend! - Friend. - What's your illness? - It's hot and cold sickness. - Hot and cold sickness? - Give him medicine for typhoid. Don't scream! Uncle Kuen. Run,run! Now, as a police officer arresting people, no one dare hinder you. Prince, this way. Go! - We're police here to arrest people. - Go. Hey, he's back! - Well? Did you get it on credit? - It's on credit. But, I saw Ma Yu-Lung. - Did you chop him? - He gave us the medicine on credit. Should all be up there. Uncle Kuen, you go ahead. Someday I'll have the chance to thank you again. - Hope to see you again. - Go. - It's Ma Yu-Lung. - Why isn't he dead yet? - Ah Ying, take care of this. - Be careful. - Officer Chun, what's the matter? - We're arresting people. - But someone reported gunshots. - It's none of your business. Patrol someplace else. - Go. - Still here? Go first! Ma Yu-Lung, you're very lucky indeed! Prince, I believe this is what you want. - Three Rings Chun, what do you mean? - What do I mean? If I can bribe you, of course I can be bribed. Thanks. Prince, this is the book. - Yan Git, I didn't expect you to betray us! - You're a traitor! Sell out? I'm just helping the Prince eliminate rebels. What the hell do you want? - Inspector Chun. - Yes? - For your trouble. - Thank you, Prince. - Then they...? - I'm taking them all back. - Good. The crates you asked for are ready. - Three Rings Chun! - What's the matter? - Do you know what you're doing? - What do you want to warn me about? - You think you can get away with something like this? As long as you can't escape, I'll get away with it. Why are you hurting me over and over? What's your animosity toward me? I have no animosity toward you. But then you set foot in my Sai Wan and arrested my minions. If I live to be a hundred, then won't there be more people against me? I'm just doing my job as a cop. You're a good cop, I'm a bad cop. We're fundamentally irreconcilable. If you don't die, then I die. Do you understand? Inspector Chun... I don't want to hear about your personal vendetta. Yes. Prince, it's best you depart before the evening markets open. - I don't want the sergeant. - I know. I'll take care of everything after you've gone. - Get on with it. - Right! - Help! - San-San! - Any more noise, I'll knock your teeth out! - It's nothing to do with her! You'd do better worrying about yourself. I've found a good home for you. - Take him up. - Yes... go! - Go! - What are you doing? Go! Push him down. - You two, go help with the boxes. - Yes. Yan Git, open the valve. Now I know what a final struggle is. Very amusing. In future, this liver pâté will surely be delicious. Our factory's pâté is famous, and it's exported. Soon, every jar of pâté will have your flesh inside. On sale all over the world. Your death will leave behind benefits for others. It fits your character, doesn't it? Keep jumping- See how long you can stand it. I'll add some oil for you. Add a bit more over there. - He's run away! - Quick, find him! Go quickly! Get the book back. Go up, quickly. - Where? - The stairs. Go up! - Well? - There's no way up. Come back down. Come up, come up! Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Quick, let's go! Don't let them go! Go down from here. Go on, or else it's too late. It's alright. Lower me down first. - Come on. - You wait. Do as I do, I'll go first. I'll go down and catch you. Jump down, jump down! - Miss, you're alright. But I'm not! - Quick, let's go! This way! Come on. Hurry up, be careful. Come quick! Come help, help! Do you have something to stand on? Just stand firm. - Come on. - Don't come over! Hold on! Jump down, I'll catch you. Don't jump, I'll get a plank first. Jump! Jump down! Jump! Jump down! - Here, take the book. - If you bring us with you, you can't get away. Look after the book for me. Go yourself. We can't get away. - OK. - Go! - Watch over them. - OK. Seal the entrance. Ma Yu-Lung? - Give us the book. - I swallowed it. Give it to us, and we'll let you live. If I only looked out for my own life, I'd be long gone. Don't talk to him. - We'll give you one more chance. - You needn't bother, I'll take my own. Outflank. - Hey, I'm wearing a hat. - Let's go, let's go! - Does it look good? - Let's go! Come on! Even God helps me. Help? Find the notebook. Got it? - Hey, what're you doing? - Why are you hitting people? After him! Cut him off. Go up. - Go to the intersection and watch. - Yes. Ma Yu-Lung, you're not our friend. But hit him and we won't be happy. Chop him! Don't worry, I'll handle the matter. Officer Chun is arresting people inside. We'll report it right away. Hold it! The Warden? - You two, go to hell! - Follow me. Prince, excuse me. I'm leaving now. Out of the way! Three Rings Chun! Your money! Hey, don't pull this rope. The floral wreath will collapse, get back! The floral wreath is collapsing. People below, move quickly! Hurry, go see if Dragon's alright. Thank you, Goddess of the Sea. - He's alright... - Check on Three Rings Chun. - Let them go now. - Excuse me, but why? I'm Prince Shun of the Qing Empire's bureau. My men were robbed and forced to defend themselves. Let them go now! - Prince...? What Prince? - You... - What Prince did he say? - I don't know. - What Prince did he say? - I don't know what he said. Right, his native accent's so heavy. - Dragon, are you alright? - I'm fine. You really deserve to die! Let them go. - Thank you. - No need, I owed it to you. - Dragon, what's up with them? - Ma Yu-Lung! Remember the purpose of our coming? Remember! Chop! Chopped! Go! - Dragon, who are they? - My friends. - Why didn't you introduce me? - I don't know them. Dismiss. Dismissed! Bravely I cut new paths As lovingly I write new songs I challenge every obstacle in my way And the difficulties ahead are nothing new to me I stand proud and feel the wind tugging at my sleeves I come and go alone and bend for nothing while youth sparks in my heart and soul I look ahead full of hope And take my chances for better or for worse I charge at every obstacle in my way And pour out my sweat and blood into song! I stand proud and feel the wind tugging at my sleeves I come and go alone and bend for nothing while youth sparks in my heart and soul I brave suffering in quest of new heights I remain true to myself Pass on my song to everyone! Leave the judgment to those who understand...
