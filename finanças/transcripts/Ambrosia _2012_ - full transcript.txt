In the hours leading up to the deadline American and British forces are moving into the demilitarized zone on the Iraq Kuwait border.

Now it's five after 5:00, minus the five minutes I just wasted explaining it to you. Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. OK. No problem. What's wrong? Nothing. He thinks I'm stupid. You become Superman in the street and then you fight with your own customer in your own store. Well, can just tell me with his pizzas? OK. Ali, don't give me shit, OK? I was stuck in that traffic. Yeah. You're always making excuses. There was an accident. Swear to god. Hey, boss. Hi. Hey. He's grumpy. So am I. Pizza's ready, sir. Oh, ho, look at this baby. What's wrong? I'm tired. Keep the change. Sorry. I'm late. See you guys later. Bye. Bye. Keys, please. You know, you should quit that restaurant, finish school, and then you will get a good job. A good job? What if I don't? You will. I kinda like serving hungry people. Yeah, just like my mom. Exactly. See ya. I'm still thinking about that accident. And the car was on its side? Yeah, It was awful. And he actually climbed up on top of it? Yes. He climbed up and he pulled them all out. Well, how many were there. Three. Why didn't he wait for the firemen? Got me. Are you ready to order? Uh, yes. I'll have the mushroom soup, Buddhist salad, but can I have tomato instead of mango? Tofu and the slim vinaigrette, please. Those are people live going up in the air. Uh huh. Just like the accident today, huh? What do you mean? Uh huh. You could've really hurt them by pulling them out. Are you actually criticizing me for helping them? Well, you should've waited for help. I can't be indifferent to other people's suffering. People are suffering all around the world. And you and me can't do anything about it. No, but there's some people who are trained for these situations. They're always late. It took them 20 minutes to get there today. You know, people are dying every second. Where's the help? You watch too much TV. You know what? If you wanna be a hero, it's fine with me. But don't get into dangerous situations. What dangerous situations? You know, I would love to be in a dangerous situation with you. Mhmm. Like the heroine you mean? Yeah. You think you're the heroine? Nice shot. It's quite different from the sketch, but I like it. I like these details here. Very unique. Thanks. Yeah, I got it. One large meat lover, no onions. OK. That'll be 40 minutes. Thank you. Why are you turning around yourself? We have seven orders waiting. I'm coming. OK. Slice the mushrooms for me. Open the olive can. You guys make the best pizza in town. Thank you. Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on this pizza and take it to John's house on Jefferson. Do you know where that is? Sure, I know. Pizza. Hey, Jackie, how's it going? I can do three of them, but it's gonna take about 45 minutes. Who's John? Where's Jefferson? , get away from there. OK. Go. Go. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Where's Jefferson? God dammit! Right there. Hey. Hi, guys. Leila. We were so busy. Thank you. Packed. We were busy, too. Lots of compliments. I, I'm wasting myself here. Maybe I should open another store downtown. How? We don't have time to live and he wants to open another store. With what money? If I get busy, who knows? Maybe I turn it into a franchise. I will be the manager. Don't you have somewhere to be? Delivery. Sorry. You can't compete with those fancy restaurants downtown. I make it fancy, too. With a brick oven, Italian writing on the wall. Fancy pizza with some lobster and caviar. That might work. Why don't you pick a Italian name too? Like, uh, Pizza. Hmm, Si, Bella. Hmm. I had a hard time with the collar. No, it's beautiful. You're very talented. Thank you. I love these pockets. They're perfect. They can even go deeper. Mhmm. I like how this off center a bit. Hey, look who's here. Hi. He's gone to India for a few months. I'm free. I really missed you. Me, too. You're my only friend and I can't see you. He's crazy. He doesn't have a problem with you. He just doesn't want me to have a friend. Don't you just wanna run away? I love my children. Then don't let him get on your nerves. What do you mean? Just pretend to be listening when he's bullshitting. Don't ever send me to that witch's house again. You're afraid of her. She's crazy. I drive my car halfway up the driveway and I... You left the car lights on. How you know? She phoned. How many times do I have to tell you. Don't go in the driveway. She doesn't like it. Why don't you get it in your head. Lights make the ghosts upset. I can't, it's so dark. I can't see anything. Where was your flashlight? How am I gonna carry a flashlight? I have the, the pizza bag in one hand and the cup of coffee in the other. She pays a good tip. I'm scared of her. What if she cast, that, uh, like a spell on me? Somebody already put a spell on you. That's why your brain is missing. Oh shut up. This is beautiful. Look at all the detail. It'll look nice on you. Don't you think? On me? Will you wear it to graduation? OK. Graduation's gotta be special. Nice, ooh. I think she deserves a limo for her graduation, huh? Oh, I love that. Yeah? Maybe I'll even wear a tie. Who knows. Can I come to that graduation party? Why? To celebrate your success. Celebrate my success? And to meet beautiful girls. If I meet a beautiful girl with a very rich father, of course she gonna fall in love with me. Then I will be set for life. And she must be blind and deaf. I will accept that. Where's she gonna find a man like me? Kind, caring, non-drinking, non-smoking, and good looking too. You may have all this, but you lack one thing. What that? A brain. You're Darwin's missing link. Huh. I'm missing my darling. That's what I say. A serious decline in a mild recession, the sky-rocketing oil prices and domestic purchasing power continuing to fall. Economic uncertainty remains a major concern for business owners across the country. According to a recent survey more than half of small businesses reported poor sales in the past 12 months. 17% are at risk of going out of business Leila, come on. It's ten to 5:00. I'm coming. In other financial news there is speculation that the Bank of Canada will cut its lending rate to 2% from 3%. The US Federal reserve is expected to make similar cuts, reducing the federal rate to 1%. Oh, that's Monica. She's a partner. No. You look breathtaking. Thank you. Oh, I'm so sorry. I love your dress, but it just wasn't me. Oh, it's OK. What are you gonna do now that you've graduated? Do you have a job yet? No. Not yet. Well, I have an opening in my firm. Are you interested? Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. You'd work side by side with myself and Monica. I would love that. Great. Monica will contact you on Monday and arrange everything. OK. Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Ugh, there was no spot in the parking lot. $18 a day and $2.50 for half an hour? What's up? I just got a job in Sarah Lane's firm. Can you believe that? I told you you would. Hey, Mon? Yeah? Did you see the girl with the green dress? Yeah. She's very talented. In what way? Well, her tailoring is impeccable and she all these brilliant ideas all the time. I'm thinking that she might be a useful addition to the firm. I'll keep her in mind next time we're hiring. Well, since we'll be busy with our line at the Lioness next year, I'd figure she'd be an asset. We don't have space for an extra person. I know. It's just Jennifer Are you thinking of getting rid of Jennifer? Well, She's been with us since we started. Sarah, she's my friend. I know. Jennifer is a fantastic person. I'm just so sick of all of her pastel cardigans all the time. I mean, fashion needs excitement. It needs risk. Let's just drop it. Oh, come on, Monica. Look at me. Look at me. We work well together. We play well together. We argue sometimes. So what? We're happy. Aren't we? Let's just go to sleep. Fine. You brought it up and now you wanna go to sleep. Don't you wanna go home? It's after 6:00. I didn't notice. Listen, I'm gonna go for a drink. Do you wanna join me? Sure. I'd like a glass of Chardonnay, please. I'll get vodka cranberry. OK. Thank you. You're welcome. Have you ever been to this kind of bar before? First time. Yeah. I can tell. I guess this would be impossible in Iran. Yeah. And there's a dangerous side for me being here right now. Why's it dangerous? Not dangerous, but, um, difficult being an Iranian. You know how people gossip. Does it concern you? No. Would it concern your husband? I don't know. Here you are. For you? Well, you live here now. You don't have to be afraid. Well, it's easy for you saying that because you were born and raised in a modern country, but back home where I come things are rooted 1,000 years in the past. And it's hard to change that, so Well, if I were you I wouldn't concern myself with that. I would just focus on what's necessary for me. I have different responsibilities. And what responsibilities might those be? I have responsibility for my family. Don't you? Well, I have my true responsibility. And what's that? Responsibility for myself. I guess we're very different. Well, cheers to that. Cheers. With a turn in upheaval in global trade this type of economic downturn has seemed inevitable. In a W-shaped recession all indicators show rapid economic decline followed by a short period of recovery. And yet another period of decline. When the economy finally recovers from the second decline, it will be in worse shape than before. Hi, guys. It would be perfect for a coat. Do you think Sarah would like a coat? What do you mean? Well, she only likes certain things. You know how she is, very hard to satisfy. Well, let's see. She seems to like the warm tones, like yellow and brown. Will you help me make it? She is very impressed by your work. Yeah? Yeah. She never likes my style. OK. But there's one condition. I can only be a secret helper. It's your gift to Sarah. That's not necessary. Then I won't do it. Well, OK. Deal. All right. OK. I'll bring it by later on this afternoon. Can you stop being a lawyer for just one second, please? OK. Yes. I'll see what I can do. All right. Goodbye. Was that Harry? He wants to finalize the Lioness contract today. He's going out of town so he needs it right now. Just waiting for Leila to finish the sample dress so I can bring it to cutter. Can you bring it to him for me? Sure. Thank you. How's it coming? I'll be done in an hour. Looks great. I love your style. Salam. Salam. What's wrong? I'm just tired. Hmm. How are you? Not good. I'm thinking of letting Ferry and Samira go. I can help you after work. No. It'll be too much for you. Just till you figure it out. I feel sorry for Monica. I like her. You know? She's very kind. Have you told Ali? Are you crazy? What am I supposed to say? That my boss is trying to hit on me? He'll make you quit. And then I'll lose my house. What if she gets obsessed with you? Mhm. There's so many lunatics in this world. I know. I live with one. Sometimes I think if I leave, he'll kill me. He's smarter than that. He'll make you kill yourself, then get credit for having lived with such a psychopath. Probably. Men. Don't worry, Ali. When I win that lottery, I will, uh, buy this store from the landlord and... Oh, thank you very much. And burn it down to set you free. The only good thing about my situation right now is that I no longer have to put up with you and your bullshit. But I cannot live without you. I'll miss you. I miss you already. Give to me. I'll miss you here. Take care. Oh, Samira. I'll bring you some cookies. OK? I'll stop by. I know. You take care of him. Give me a ride? Sure. Way too hard. You're probably right. Probably? For god sake, can you ever just say that I'm right? Please don't act like a child. You're right. Why can't we have a discussion without getting into an argument? I'm just telling you what's actually bothering me. This is useless. "The values of morality are created by a group of people at some point in time for their own benefit. And then we follow it thinking it's a benefit to us." Like me holding to my marriage. No, my friend. That is not morality. That is foolishness. Listen. "We should have a personal morality based on the power of distinguishing between the things that benefit us and the things that injure us. We should judge an action by its effect on our own well-being." In that case, I should get a divorce. I don't know. I'm not you. It's just that now I need to concentrate on myself. Sometimes you really scare me. Right there. That is your moral virtue talking. This is absurd. You should quit. She is evil. She can ruin your life. Evil? You're scared of me, aren't you? No. Have you ever been in love? I don't wanna talk about it. I saw your Ali. You're not in love with him. Being loved is different from loving someone. You need to love. Take care of yourself, your own needs. Then you will blossom. Are you ready? How big is your thing? How big do you like it? Um, not too big. 10 inches? 12 inches? 14 inches? What size do you like? You know, my friend sent me here. She says you make the best pizza in town. Oh, thank you. You still haven't told me how big you like the thing. The pizza, I mean. 10 inches is good. Oh, OK. 10 inches. So you like it small. It's good. OK. And what kind would you like? Spicy. And that'll be $15.99. This is my wife. She's the boss. And she likes it big. Do you have children? Oh, no, no. We just practice a lot. Right, honey? You can pay me later. I'll be back in 15 minutes. OK. See ya. I just wasn't listening. Hey, you never listen to anything I say anymore. I'm sick and tired of your tedious jokes. I work night and day. I do so much for you.. Have you ever been happy in this relationship? Don't be ridiculous. I'm not saying that. Where have you been? There was an accident. Well, I have deliveries to make. Sun-dried tomato. Oh god. How can I help you? I'm here for the two larges. OK. That'll be $39.99. You change your prices? No. We ordered pizza last month. Well, I haven't raised my prices since last year. What's your number? Two, two, four, seven, four, nine, three. You have ordered since last year. Are you calling me a liar? I don't know. Are you? You know, you can't treat your customers like that. This is my business. And I'll do anything I want. And if you don't like it, you don't order. You know, we're in Canada, not wherever you come from. Get the hell outta here before I kick your ass. Stop it. Please leave. Get back to your fucking country. Control yourself! What the hell country is his father from? It's OK. What's this? Just a little surprise. Wow. It's gorgeous. Look at those buttons. They're pretty, aren't they? Where'd you find them? I can't remember. You should try it on. It's perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Don't touch me. You know if I was a man you'd probably be in love with me already. Please, stop it. The only thing stopping you from loving me is the values of conventional morality. It's your moral virtue, which is created by men for their own convenience. It's a slave morality. Open your heart. Enlighten yourself. Oh, I almost forgot. Scott from Ramont magazine phoned earlier. Thank you. Are these the folders you had asked for? Yeah. Are you hung over? No, I'm just tired. Looks like they're all here. Did you want some sushi? Hey, are you OK? I'm OK. I think you better go home. Thanks. Canadian Pizza. I ordered two medium pizzas a while ago and one I asked for feta. There isn't any. In the second one there's no capers. OK. I'm really sorry. Um, I'll, I'll give you credit for next time. But I don't like what I got. Do you want me to send you two more? That's fine. OK. I'll, I'll send them for you. Uh, can you just, uh, send me back the ones you didn't like? We ate them. Well, then I'll give you a discount for next time. That's not right. I wasn't happy with my pizzas. Well, then you shoulda called earlier. Don't you have a customer satisfaction policy? No. I, I can't afford this policy. I, I can't afford to give away free pizza when there's no major problem with it. OK then. Well, I just won't order from you anymore. All right. Well, have a good night. Nothing. I'm just tired. Very nice house. Well kept. So where are you from? Iran. Iraq? Iran. The other axis of evil. Well, the house has a nice layout. It's got, uh, excellent design. That's all my wife. She's a fashion designer. Oh, really? Yeah, no. I think it's reasonably priced. It'll sell quickly. OK. Hey, boss. Hey. Hey, brought you some cookies. Thank you. Where's Leila? Oh, she'll be here soon. She OK? She's good. Something's wrong. She's doing two jobs. She's probably tired. Yeah. You think I don't know that? Then you should make up your mind about this place, Ali. I spent 10 years of my life building up this damn place. You think I can make up my mind so quickly? You can do whatever you want. Go to school. You need change. Change, huh? Change. Hello? I gotta go to work. Where are you? Well, what about all the deliveries I have to make? Hello, how can I help you? Hi. Uh, I have an appointment. And what is your name? Uh, my name is Leila. Leila, is anybody with you today? Um, no. OK. Do you have your picture ID with you? I do, yes. If you could just show it to that silver camera on the wall to your right, please. OK. That's. Perfect. Come on in. Thank you. Leila? Hi, come with me, please. OK. How do you feel about your decision? What do you mean? Do you feel confident about it? Do you have any questions or any concerns? I feel like it's my only choice. Um, have you discussed this with your husband? No. Well, ultimately it's your decision. I'm getting a divorce. And I can't raise a child by myself. So I've made up my mind. Do you want to book an appointment today? Yes, please. OK. You need to be here on Thursday at 11:00 AM. Here are the instructions you need to follow for the procedure. OK. Don't drink or eat anything after midnight. And someone has to pick you up. You can't drive. See? You look like my sister, my youngest sister. That'll be 40 minutes. OK? Thank you. Canadian Pizza. No. I'm, I'm sorry. I can't do pasta tonight. No, we're just too busy with the pizza. No pasta tonight. OK. Thank you. I'm tired of corn. I want something else. I hate corn. Why? I had to finish a dress. Bullshit. Whatever. I was so busy I lost five orders. I'm losing my life here and all you care about is your damn orders? I don't give a shit about your stupid business. My business is paying for your whimsies, your clothes, this house. I pay for my house. I put the house on the market. What? Yeah. You bastard. I'm done. Fuck you and all this. Fuck it. What are you doing? We don't have anything in common. Oh. Right. You're the designer and I'm nobody. You don't understand me. And that is exactly my point. What do you want me to do? We can't afford this house anymore. You fucked up my life and you're leaving me? I fucked up your life? You fucked up my life. Where are you're going? It's none of your businesses. Just get away. Don't go. Please, just, just, go away. No. Don't go. Come on. Come on, get away. Hey, are you OK? Yeah. Sarah told me to send you home. Are you still sick? Yeah. Leila, it's been two weeks. Have you seen a doctor? Well, what is it? Is it serious? I'm pregnant. Oh. Well, congratulations. I, I was worried. I don't wanna keep it. Oh. Well, listen, you take some time off. Come back when you sort things out. OK? Please don't tell Sarah. Please? OK. Hi, Maryanne. How are you? Did you talk to Leila today? Yeah. Where did she stay last night? OK. Well, if you see here today can you please tell her to call me? I, I really need to talk to her. OK. Bye. Hey, sweetie, you should've come last night. Thank you. Hey, boss. No, she's not here. But she did call. I know. Oh. OK. I'll, uh, call her. OK. Bye. What did he want? He needs the car. Deliveries. He can have it. I'll leave it on the street. I'll take it to him. You don't know what you're doing, do you? Ali's a good man. It's not a question if he's good or bad. Then what is it? We're just different. That's all. You don't have a reason, do you? I don't love him. Typical. You've known him how long? 14 years. So you've known him 14 years. Suddenly you've decided you don't love him anymore. I wasted my life. Nonsense. Where are you staying tonight? I'll go over to Samira's. I wish I could take you to my place. It's OK. Call him tomorrow, OK? He's worried about you. OK. Sure. I'll get those to you on Monday. It's the last Wednesday of the month. Are you really thinking about that? OK. Thanks. Can I help you? Hi, I'm here to see Leila. Hi, I'm Sarah. You must be Ali. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. Oh, are you Leila's husband. Yes. Please, come into my office. Sure. Leila's not here. She's been sick. You haven't noticed that? I haven't seen her in a couple of days. Oh. Why's that? We, um, had an argument. And she left you? I, I shouldn't have come here. No, please. She has been acting differently, hasn't she? So you've noticed this too. Hmm. Do you think maybe there might be someone else? I don't think so. Um, I have to go. Don't worry. I'll talk to her. Thank you. Bye bye. What was that all about? I think they're separating. What was his name again? Ali. Seems like a nice enough guy. How could you be satisfied by a man like that? He's too simple, too ordinary. I see. Let's not tell her that he came in. Hello. How can I help you? Hi. I have an appointment today. And what is your name? It's Leila. Leila, anybody with you? No. Do you have your picture ID with you? Yes. If you could show it into the silver camera on the wall. Great. And if you have a cell phone, please turn it off. Come on in. Thank you. Leila? Welcome. All right. There you go. Put this on for me, please. And I'll be back in a few minutes. OK. Thank you. You're welcome. Is she having an affair? No. Are you sure? An affair? I don't think so. Hey, how did it go? You OK? I couldn't do it. I knew you could not do that. This looks delicious. Hmm. What are you making? Persian. Beautiful. Are you having an affair? What? Who has time for an affair? Then what the heck is wrong with you? There is a buyer for your house and he wants to talk to you. I don't care. Tell him to sell it. Hi. Hey. How are you? I'm OK. Did you? No. I decided to keep it. Good. All right then. So if you will sign here, great. And initial there and there. OK. That's it. All right. Congratulations. When are you leaving, boss? Next week. You have to see this. Oh, wow. I was so worried she wouldn't like it. But she did. She loved it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You not close this place yet? Hey, Ferry. I just became officially homeless. I hear. So you gonna get rid of this place, too? Yeah. Would that make you happy? Damn right. Absolutely. Want one? Sure. What about me? Get a pop. That just cost me $0.50. You're bankrupt anyway. Yeah. Well, to bankruptcy. I wanna thank you for the coat. What coat? The amber one. What are you talking about? Why don't you wanna admit it? Admit what? That you're attracted to me. Sarah, what do you want from me? Don't you know? I'm in love with you. Do you really think I believe that? Oh, you think only a man can love a woman. Men have no clue. I think I know what you want from me. You think I just want sex. You see? You don't know me. I'm not what you think I am. Do you really wanna know what I think of you? I think you want everybody to be just like you. But you do wanna be like me, dont' you? No. I don't. Then why did you leave Ali? How do you know that? He's not right for you. You don't know anything. I know that you don't wanna be with Ali. I know that you're attracted to me, but your old ways are keeping you from falling in love with me. So this is what you think? You're finally breaking free, Leila. It's such a good sign. Let me help you. So you figured out everything cause you are a modern woman and I am behind? You need to start living in the present instead of being stuck in the past. Fuck you, Sarah. Why are you up so early? Trying to wake you up. Why? Ali's coming. What for? He wants to talk. Did you tell him? No. You have to talk to him, Leila. You guys need to figure out what you wanna do. Are you trying to get rid of me? Kind of. Hey, boss. Hey. Come in. She'll be out in a minute. OK. Would you like some tea? Uh, no. No thanks. OK. It's there. How about some cookies? No. I'm, I'm good. OK. Gotta go. Gotta catch the bus. OK. See you later. Yeah. OK. Bye. Bye. Salam. Salam. Sure. Thanks. I missed you. I'm sorry about the house. How's the store? Fighting a war. You have nothing to lose. I don't wanna lose you. I'll do anything if you come home.
