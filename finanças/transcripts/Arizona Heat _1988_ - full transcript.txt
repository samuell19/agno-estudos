[MUSIC - STEPPENWOLF, "THE PUSHER"] [SINGING] You know I smoked a lot of grass. Oh, lord, I popped a lot of pills. But I've never touched nothing that my spirit could kill. You know I've seen a lot of people walking around with tombstones in their eyes. But the pusher don't care if you live or if you die. God damn the pusher. God damn, hey, I say, the pusher. I said god damn, god damn the pusher man. You know the dealer, the dealer is a man with the love grass in his hand. Oh, but the pusher is a monster. Good god, he's not a natural man. The dealer, for a nickel, lord, will sell you lots of sweet dreams. Ah, but the pusher ruin your body. Lord, he'll leave your, leave your mind to scream. God damn, uh-huh, the pusher. God damn, god damn the pusher. I said god damn, god, god damn the pusher man. Lieutenant Kapinski. Put me through to Captain Samuels. [KNOCKING] It's me, Eddie. That shit is still cooling. It ain't gonna be ready for about, uh-- Einstein, how much longer? Two hours. Two hours. Yeah, come on, you guys said-- I know what I said! Hm? All right, I'll be back. You ain't going no place. Snapper and I are gonna do a little bit of balling And you're gonna watch. I like an audience. I'm what they call a-- Einstein, what do they call that? Exhibitionist. An exhibitionist. You don't got no problem with that, do you? No. Good. Just stay right there. [SINGING] God damn, ah, the pusher. God damn the pusher. [LAUGHING] Al right, I phoned in for a search warrant, if the son of a bitch ever gets here. Murphy? Yeah. I want you to go in and cover the room. When the warrant gets here, you're gonna serve it. Don't do a goddamn thing till I get there, you got that? Yes, sir. All right. Let's go. Rollins, you're with me. Try to find the water at this dump and shut it down. I want nobody flushing nothing down the toilet. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Ah! Hey, Einstein, what's with the water, man? What about it? There ain't none, man. There's something up. [GUN COCKING] You, you go check the hall. Freeze, police. [GUNSHOT] Freeze. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] Stay where you are, scum bag. Against the fucking wall! Keep moving, four eyes. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] Cover the exit! Did you guys hear about choir practice the other night? - No. - It was unbelievable. There was about ten of us. And Artie brings this broad. Artie? I don't know where he found her, but, you know-- Anyway, we're all in this circle. And she's standing in the middle. And she starts to do this slow strip, right? And then the next thing you know, she's-- Hi, guys. Hey, John, how's it going? Slow. The storm's got everyone inside, I guess. Yeah, first really big one of the season, scares people. Scares the shit out of me, I tell you. Damn lightning, it's gonna light me up like a Christmas tree one of these nights, I'm telling you. Jesus, Andy, you're perfectly safe inside the car. Funny, funny man. Hey, look who's back. - Murphy. - Murphy. Hey, Murph. Hey, welcome back, man. Sorry about your brother. He was a good cop. Thanks. You OK now? Yeah. I'm fine. Hey, uh, what are you? The Sheik of Arabique or something? Huh? Oh, this? I figured the way it's blowing out there, it's gonna be pouring by the time I get back out. You motorcycle guys are nuts, taking a bike out on a night like this. You might as well stick your finger in a light socket for Chrissake. Excuse me, officers. There's a car out there blocking an intersection. Guy slumped over the wheel, looks like he's drunk or something. Hey, Robinson, could you get that? If I don't tap this kidney, I'm gonna bust. Sure, why not? Thanks. I'll take care of it. [THUNDER CLAPPING] Hey, buddy. Come on, pal, wake up. Hey, buddy. [EXPLOSION] [PHONE RINGING] Whoever this is, you're a sadistic son of a bitch. Well, this is Samuels. And you're right, I'm a sadistic son of a bitch. What do you want? Just be in my office in the next 45 minutes. I got two days off, remember? SAMUELS [ON PHONE]: They've been canceled. Bastard. Wake up, honey. Wake up. Come on. Hi. Hi. You look awful. And I feel awful. Go on, get up and make me some coffee. Why don't I stay here and make you feel a whole lot better? Because I have to go to work. That's why. - You bastard! - What? You son of a bitch! You said you'd take us to Las Vegas. What? Can't a person get any sleep around here? What the hell is going on? He lied! That's what's going on. He had no intentions of taking us to Las Vegas. That was a load of crap just to get us to come home with you. You lousy creep! Don't take it so personal. Yeah. Come on, mom. Let's get out of here. It's mom? Bye. Wow. You always do this. Mother, he filmed us. He's nice. - We can't go to Vegas now. - He's nice. You expect too much. - He's nice? What's nice about him? If you're gonna hang around, fix me some coffee. Shove your coffee! Now, now, be nice. Thanks, sweetheart. Bye, honey. [CHATTER] It better be good. You don't know what I gave up for this. You look like shit. Funny, I feel like shit. Is this what you brought me in for? Uh-huh. Robinson, huh? Good cop. Yeah. Says it was an accident. Says lightning hit a car. You know, I gave up two weeks in Vegas with an incredible mother and daughter team. Look, spare me the details of your sordid sex life, Kapinski. And it wasn't an accident. If you learn to read past the goddamn headlines, captain, you'll see it was an accident. Lightning hit a car and it blew up. Are you through? All right. It's monsoon season. During the monsoon season, lightning every night. SAMUELS: Mm-hm. The other night there was lightning, hit the god damn car and blew the son of a bitch up. Case solved. I'm taking a week. You're amazing, Kapinski, you know that? Because in a matter of seconds, boy, you sift right through the facts and get to the truth. It's something, isn't it? Oh, it's something all right. It's a crock. Now, sit down. The explosion was deliberate. Robinson's death was an accident. Who was the intended victim? He hasn't been identified yet. What about the automobile registration? That's no good. And the plates were switched. Why me? Why me? Why not Cooper, Blakely? Cooper and Blakely couldn't find their butt holes without a mirror. Right. Where the hell do you think you're going? I'm gonna solve your case, captain. We're not through yet. I'm through! You're through when I say you're through, and you're not through! And you're getting a partner on this one. No, I'm not. You know, you're really a smart ass, Kapinski. But I enjoy it, because it keeps things interesting. My orders are to team you up with a female detective. And by damn, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Who says? The chief and me. We feel that it might help curb your propensity towards violence. Horse cock. Andrews. You better clean up that mouth of yours. Yes, sir. This is Larry Kapinski. He's your new partner. Kapinski, this is Jill Andrews. Be nice. Hot damn, piss, fuck, fart, asshole. How you doing? Didn't offend you, did I? Hey, slick, I thought you gave that shit up? Where are we going? We're going to the lab. Where'd they dig you up? Deer Valley station. Samuels requested me specifically. Do you know why he partnered you with me? I have an idea. Because I'm a maniac? Something like that. Yeah, every place I go, I leave corpses and smoking guns. I heard you haven't had an unsolved case in over two years. Doesn't mean shit to the chief. He still thinks I'm a maniac. He thinks I need you. Hey, Fergie. How's it hanging? Kapinski, how's my boy? Hung over. I feel like three-day-old dog shit. Hey, I got something for that. New formula I've been working on. I've been looking for a Guinea pig. I can't think of anybody better than a professional boozer like you. You can't be serious. Yeah, I'm serious. Drink this. You'll feel like a new man in an hour, guaranteed. [BELCHING] Of course, there may be side effects. Who's this? My new partner. Hi. Jill Andrews. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Since when do you need a partner? Captain stuck me with her, god damn, thought it'd curb my propensity towards violence. Propensity towards violence? That's got more syllables than most of your sentences. And you're a Phi Beta Kappa, huh? What about that car explosion the other night? Yeah, it's right here. Is that it? I should have figured they'd put you on this. Pretty sure it was a Gumby, plastic. What did they trigger it with? That I am sure of. It was triggered by remote control, no question. These are pieces of a servo mechanism and receiver probably from a radio controlled airplane, garage door opener, something similar. Haven't got enough pieces to tell for sure. Well, if you get anything else-- Hey, let me know if the formula works. Yeah, I'll bring you back a stool specimen. What's eating you? Nothing. Why? Why? Ever since we left the lab, you've been mute. What do you care what's eating me? I'm just somebody you're stuck with. I work alone. I've always worked alone. And I like it that way. So it's not my fault. Maybe I've been sitting here thinking I've been stuck with you. Did you ever think of that? Yeah, the thought did cross my mind. And? And I dismissed it as being absolutely ridiculous. Listen, you sure you want to come in? An autopsy can get a little ripe if you're not used to it. You're stuck with me, remember? Look all I want to do-- --is protect me? Ah, shit, here it comes. Look, Kapinski, just because I'm a woman, doesn't mean-- Don't give me that woman lib crap! You wanna come in and barf your guts out, come in and barf your guts out. Yeah, Kapinski, I want to come in and barf my guts out! [RETCHING] Uh, who are you? Jill Andrews. Kapinski's partner. Partner? What's the matter with Larry? I've never seen him get sick before. Well, I think he has a hangover. Is that the John Doe from the car explosion? Yeah, what's left of him. Have you made any progress on the ID? None Any chance for prints? Are you kidding? Come on over here. There's too much charring. Look at that. It's burnt right through to the bone. I can't even tell you what color eyes this guy had. Look, I don't know, I might be able to get you a blood type, but that's about it. Well, look, OK, I'll keep working on this guy. I don't know, who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky. Thanks. What about the height and weight? About 5', 10.5". Approximately 175 pounds. Anything else? Well, yes, as a matter of fact. Yeah, and this is very odd. There was only one portion of his anatomy that wasn't completely burnt away-- his unusually large penis. [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. Thank you. [RETCHING] Must have been that green shit. Must have been. What are you looking at? Nobody. What is it with you? What's your problem? Spit it out. You. You're nothing but a foul-mouthed, egotistical bastard. Yeah, but you're stuck with me. [LAUGHS] Come on, Kapinski. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. Kapinski, let me ask you something. Does your macho image mean that much to you? I have this suit of armor. See, I wear it against the world. Don't want no chinks in it, you know. What are you afraid of, Kapinski? Not a god damn thing. Yeah, you may be able to sell that to your usual bimbos, but I don't believe it for a minute. You're afraid of your own emotions. If we're going to try to get along, don't psychoanalyze me. I hate that bullshit with a passion. Don't flatter yourself. I'm not. You're not worth the effort. Spare me. How'd I get sucked into this conversation in the first place? DISPATCHER [ON RADIO]: Attention, all units in the area. A 211 silent alarm at the bank. Corner of 23rd Avenue and Bethany Home road. Units responding. Please acknowledge. Detective Kapinski and Andrews. We're right across the street from the location. Contact all units, no sirens, no lights, got that? No sirens, no lights. DISPATCHER [ON RADIO]: 10-4. Go get 'em, Larry. You know her? We've done the two-backed beast. Unbelievable. I wish she'd said that. Grab that radio. All right, now, listen, here's what you do. You walk straight across the street. You go into the bank. Whatever they tell you to do, do it. They never suspect a woman as being a cop. Lay down on the floor, whatever they say. When they leave, lock the doors, you got that? You keep saying "they?" How do you know there's more than one. I don't. I always think the worst. And lock the goddamn doors. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] How do you want to handle this one? Well, my partner is inside. They don't know she's a cop. She's gonna lock the doors. When they come outside, we'll have them trapped. With any luck at all, it'll go down easy, with any luck at all. OK. There we are. Lock the goddamn door. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [TIRES SCREECHING] Hold on! Wait for me! Get in, god damn it! [CRASHING] Jesus Christ! Hey, what's going on here! Oh, no! Whoa! Look, Kapinski-- Let's radio for some help, OK? Fuck that. We got it. Whoa. Now! Shoot that son of a bitch! [GUNSHOT] Shoot the son of a bitch! ANDREWS: Holy shit! BANK ROBBERS: [SCREAMING] Jesus Christ! You are a maniac. We got the dirty bastards. [EXPLOSION] Kapinski! You got 'em, but you managed to destroy half the west side doing it. Damn it, Kapinski, we put you and Andrews together to try to stop this sort of thing. And you two are together for less than three hours, and we got dozens of civilian cars wrecked, a police car trashed, a used car lot destroyed, three dead suspects, and another dead police officer. What are you talking about? Joe Rollins got it. Where? He took one in the back during the shoot out at the bank. That's impossible. SAMUELS: Obviously, it wasn't impossible. Every goddamn cop I had at that fucking bank robbery was behind a car. There's no way he could have taken it in the bank. Well, he did. He got a .223 right in the heart. The damn slug lodged in the car door and forensics dug it out. You know as well as I do that a .223 comes from a high-powered rifle. They had a shotgun and a .45. Another cop dead in less than 24 hours, and by damn, I want some answers. Which one? Rollins or Robinson? Both. You know, I got this gut feeling these two deaths are connected. How? Robinson's death wasn't intentional. Well, two cops dead in less than 24 hours is more than a goddamn coincidence. Yeah, there's no evidence that even remotely suggests a coincidence. Yes, because we haven't found the evidence yet, honey. Kapinski, did you ever stop and think you might be paranoid? Oh, this is that second year psychology crap out of junior college, right? All that bullshit is coming out. I can just feel it. Come on, I'm only kidding. Uh-huh. Or can't you stand a little ribbing? You know something? You got nice, uh-- Oh, shit, here it is. Here's what? I've been waiting all day for this bull shit. All day for what bullshit? The pass. The pass? That wasn't a pass, honey. That was only a compliment. Uh-huh, only. No, "you're pretty" is a compliment. "You got nice uh" is a pass. And just forget about it Kapinski, because I'm not interested. Seems to me I've heard that song before. OK, we're here. You check out the witnesses. I'll catch up to you later. Got it. What are you doing here? I thought you were talking to witnesses from the robbery. Couldn't tell me a thing. Oh. Where have you been? I stopped and had a beer. I thought you thought my theory was crap. Yeah, I did think it was crap. So what the hell are you doing here? Well. Ah-ha. Where'd you find it? Right over there, directly across from the bank. - Give it to Samuels. - Oh, no. It's your theory, Kapinski. Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. You know some of those clouds get up to 50,000 feet? My favorite time of year, monsoon season. Yeah. Mine, too. - Really? Yeah. Yeah, I love it during the late afternoon when the sun filters through the dust and spreads those colors over everything. You have a nice ass, too. Oh, god. What? - Will you drop it, Kapinski? - What? I am not interested. Can't you get that through your thick head. - How about dinner? - No. Wanna do dinner? No? - No. - No? No. Guess I'm not interested. Pain in the ass. A cop killer? A cop killer. What kind of evidence do you have to support a cockamamie theory like that? There's two dead cops. That's enough. But they're not related. They're related by uniform. Evidence, Kapinski, evidence. That's not evidence. That's supposition, a bad guess. What the hell is this? That's what you call evidence. We found that on the roof of the restaurant across from the bank. So? So Rollins was killed with a .223, right? We found that on the roof. Doesn't mean a thing. Whoever fired that was probably a member of the bank gang. And of course, thanks to you, we'll never know for sure, will we? If he was part of the group that robbed the bank, there'd be a hell of a lot more casings and a hell of a lot more dead cops, but there's one shell and one dead cop. Whoever pulled that trigger knew exactly what he was aiming at. And it was Rollins. Who'd want to kill Rollins? I don't know. Who would want to kill Robinson? Nobody. But I tell you what, I think your theory stinks, Kapinski. That's what I think. I hope to hell you're right, captain. You didn't say a goddamn word. It's your theory, Kapinski. Look, times like this, you're supposed to stick up for your partner. Oh, we're partners again are we? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Make up your mind, Kapinski. You can't have it both ways. Either we're partners or we're just two people who are stuck with one another. Either way, I don't care. All right, all right. We're partners. Feel any better? Yeah. Good, wanna have dinner? I won't try and get in your pants. We'll just have a little wine. - No, no, no, no, no. - Some music. I've got plans for the evening. Plans can be changed. No. I'll see you tomorrow. If you're lucky. You know, I feel about as lucky as my last silver dollar in Vegas. See you tomorrow. [WOLF WHISTLING] No, Kappy, I don't know nothing. Ask me about pimps or dope or broads, I'm an Encyclopedia Britannical. But this, you probably know more about it than I do. Look, the word on the street is somebody's popping cops. Nobody knows who it is. That's all I know. Look, Kappy, I wouldn't shit you. You're my favorite turd. Your mama should have hit you in the head and sold the milk. I like that. I like it. I'm gonna use it. I bet you will. What's this for? What's this for? Get your ears clean. When you hear something, let me know. And get rid of that tie. I got this tie in Hawaii. Well, Detective Lieutenant Kapinski, what brings you here? Come to see how the other half lives. Yeah, doesn't look too bad either. Is this the spot? Every night, same place, same time? You get into a routine. You know how that is. Feel funny if you change it, like you could get hurt or something. I know how that is. But is it usually you three and that's it? Yeah, just the three of us. Till about five minutes before we leave, Robinson would come in. And Murphy, Castelli, some of the other motor guys. Hey, Kapinski, I heard they teamed you with a lousy broad. Is Captain Samuels lining your ass up for you now? Ah, yeah, not bad, either. Better than your action, from what I hear, that little twisted choir practice. I heard she had you on your knees sweating like a whore in church. Who told you that? She told me. [LAUGHING] Hey, Kapinski. Yeah. I heard about your little Sunday drive today. Did you really destroy a used car lot? Anything for you, Castelli. Where in the hell were you the other night? I got here just after it happened. But Murphy was here with these guys. Well, you saw it, didn't you, Murph? I was in the john, but I heard it. Larry, let me out, will you? I gotta get back to work. See you guys later. Hey, Thomas, let me talk to you outside. OK. Sorry about your brother. Thanks. Johnny, was there anything unusual the night before the accident? Unusual strange or unusual different? Either way. I don't know. Everything was pretty much as usual, I guess. John came in. Murphy came in. So anyways, then a citizen came up and tells about this car in the intersection. Robinson volunteered to go and check it out. Next thing you know, all hell broke loose. What about the guy that reported the car? Was he legit? Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, still in the restaurant when it happened. He didn't try to run or anything. We got his name and address, put it in the report. Nah, he was real cooperative. All right. Thanks, John. It wasn't an accident, was it? Well, it wasn't lightning, if that's what you mean. I hear you. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Shit, I don't really want to do this. Hi. What kept you, officer? Step out of the car, please Hell no. That's lightning out there. Sorry. Scares the shit out of me. Please get out of the car. Believe me, I don't like this anymore than you do. [EXPLOSION] [ENGINE REVVING] Oh my god! Oh, Jesus Christ, Kapinski, it's 6:00 AM. You woke up the whole goddamn neighborhood. Hurry up and get dressed. Our caseload just grew by one. OK. Have some coffee or something. It's gonna take me 20 minutes. All right. What do you mean our caseload grew by one? Ernie Wexler got a killed last night. I don't know-- A cop. Oh, shit. Oh, not another one. I hope you don't mind instant. Jill said black. This is my roommate, Terry. - Hi. - Terry, this is-- Larry Kapinski. The new partner I told you about. You don't seem like such a maniac. Terry! Well, he doesn't. Yeah, well, you haven't seen him drive. She never told me she had a roommate. I work for one of the airlines. I'm only here half the time. Oh. Didn't you have something to do? Shower or something? Yeah, give me about 20 minutes, OK? Yeah. Take 25. How long you plan to be in Phoenix? I have a week off. Well, if you get some time, I'd like to paint the town some night. Was he uniformed? Who? Wexler. Oh, yeah, why? Well, that sure fits your theory, doesn't it? How was he killed? Hit and run late last night. Hurry up. I gotta use your bathroom. It's my third cup of coffee, if you get the drift. Yeah, down the hall, past the bedroom Yeah, down the hall, past the bedroom It's hard to tell these days. She's a dyke. You know, dyke? So? So I come in here and tell you that the partner you give me is packing a dildo and you say so? What's your problem, Kapinski? Come on, get out of here and get back to work. I'm busy. All right, so I knew it. Why? Think about it, Kapinski. Think about what? I'm damn tired of putting up with your crap. And I'll be damned if I'll be lining up your young ladies for you, too. You think when I'm out on the job, I'm playing hide the weenie? Hell yes! Now listen to me, both of you, three police officers dead in less than two days. And so far, you haven't come up with one solid clue as to what's going on. Now, Kapinski, I know that Andrews is a fine-looking woman, but she doesn't like you. And that's just too bad. And I also realize, Andrews, that Kapinski is a foul-mouthed, arrogant, chauvinistic son of a bitch. And if he offends your sensibilities, that's also too bad. We have a psycho cop killer out there. And you gotta stop him before he does it again. Now, do I make myself clear? Shut up, Kapinski. Officially, there is nothing linking the three murders, but unofficially, Kapinski, I think you're right. But my problem is is that half of the police officers out there are scared to death and the other half so damn nervous that sooner or later, one of them is going to do something stupid. And that's bad. Now, last night, we got lucky. We have a witness. And we kept him here all night trying to sober the sucker up. And hopefully he wasn't so damn drunk that he won't remember something. You two think you can stop your bickering long enough to question him? We might have to work with you, but I don't have to like it. Lighten up, Kapinski I'll lighten up when you straighten up. It really bugs you, doesn't it? In a word, yeah. OK, fine, but now's not the time. It ain't natural. It isn't any less natural than straight sex. You mean to tell me that two guys making it together is natural? - Yeah, I do. You're sick. Uh, excuse me, am I in the right room? Are you Gordon? Yes. Then you're in the right room, Gordon. I want your opinion on something, Gordon. What do you think about dykes? Oh, for Chrissake, Kapinski. I'm asking the man his opinion. I want his opinion. Well, Gordon, what do you think about dykes? Well, I don't know. I never really thought about it, mind. Don't give me that horseshit, Gordon. OK, come on, that's enough. No, no, I want to know. Gordon, Gordon, over here. You know when you go to those skin flicks and the dykes come out, the lessies come out, and they get the scene going. What does it do for you? What does it bring out? God damn it, Kapinski! It does sound kind of gross when you say it out loud, doesn't it? POLICE OFFICER [ON INTERCOM]: Detective Kapinski, there's a guy on the phone named Toad said he won't talk to no one else but you. Yeah, yeah, be right there. You question the eunuch, Mr. Neuter here. I'm gonna take the call. OK, Gordon. Kappy, where the hell you been? I've been hanging here for five minutes. You know it's 110 in here? Good, maybe you'll sweat some of that fat off your ass. I just want a little consideration, that's all. KAPINSKI [ON PHONE]: You got your consideration last night, numb nuts. You said that was to get my ears cleaned. Listen, you have something to tell me or not, Toad? I think I got a line on a possible ID on that John Doe that did a patty melt in that car the other night. I'm listening. Who was he? Not yet. I got one more thing to check out. Meet me at the Serendipity Bar at 1:30. You cretin. So what kind of car was the suspect driving? It was a motorcycle, and he didn't know. Motorcycle? What did he look like? He didn't know. What the hell did he know? Nothing. Oh, hell of a witness. Look, the man was drunk, that plus when the lightning struck, he dove for cover in his car. He didn't see anything. We're getting no where fast. What about the guy who just called? Toad? Yeah. Won't he know something? I don't know, maybe. Well, aren't we at least going to go talk to him? I don't know why I didn't think of that, Jesus Christ. Well, hello there. I'm Toad. Jill Andrews. Very nice to meet you, Miss Andrews. Won't you sit down? Thanks. Try not to make an ass out of yourself, Toad. What do you mean? I was just being polite. Polite? You have the charm of a love-starved cobra. Bring me a glass, hon, I'll have some of this beer. I'll have a 7UP with a twist of lime, please. You'd puke a dead rat off a gut wagon. Leave me alone, will you, and let me eat my lunch in peace. You don't eat, you inhale. Listen, I expect you to buy my lunch, not tell me how to eat it. Look, can we just get on with this so we can get out of here, OK? I think I got a line on your barbecued John Doe. There's this chick, Lisa something, she's a dancer at the Best of the West club. She's got this boyfriend, he's an actor. Anyway, he wants to be, but he's so ugly, he can't even make it in the pornos, you know? Too bad, too, 'cause from what I hear, he really has the qualifications. What do you mean by that? Shit, Kappy knows that I mean. The son of a bitch is hung like a horse. Dig this, he calls himself Footlong. What's this got to do with what we're talking about? Don't be so impatient. You ought to learn to slow down, relax. Come on, enjoy your lunch. Here. Have a ring. - I'm not eating lunch. - How about you? Come on, have one, they're good. No, thanks. I'm allergic. So anyway, the other day some weirdo walks in looking for Footlong. Says he needs an actor to play a joke on a friend. The guy gives him 50 bucks and a car to use, and Footlong hasn't been seen since. This is it? I mean, do you think this is our John Doe, this Footlong? Yeah, why not. That's so god damn thin, you can buy me lunch. Give him the check. Come on, Kappy, I did the best I could. I told you the street's quiet on this one. Change that green suit. You're starting to ferment. Kappy. He gave us nothing. What do you mean? That was a solid lead. You mean that crap about Footlong? The man had a large penis. Take it from me, it's very rare. Oh, yeah, how would you know about that? I read about it. You trying to tell me you weren't always a dyke? Yes, no. When I first became aware of the possibility I might be gay, I couldn't deal with it. I thought there had to be some other reason why I didn't enjoy sex with men. Anyway, I read everything I could get my hands on that had to do with sex and men and, you know. No, I don't know. Come on, Kapinski, what did you think? I woke up one morning and said, from now on, I'm going to be gay? Well, I don't know. Oh, man. No, you stay here. Why? Why? Girls show their nipples in there. I don't want you to get all excited. Oh, that's ridiculous. What's ridiculous about that? What about you? What? What about you? What's to keep you from getting all excited in there? It's natural for me, honey. [MUSIC PLAYING] What'll you have? Oh, nothing, thanks. We're looking for a dancer named Lisa. You bring me the first beer you bump into. I'll have a 7UP with a twist. Lisa. You're hurting my arm. I'm hip. Which one's Lisa? She's on stage. KAPINSKI: Tell her to come over to the table. You just can't help pushing your weight around, can you, Kapinski? What do you want me to do? Kiss her? You wanted to see me? You're Lisa? Lisa Hunter. You're cops, aren't you? Have I done something wrong? - No. Sit down, please. I'm Detective Andrews. This is Detective Kapinski. We just want to talk to you about your boyfriend. Johnny? Have you seen Johnny? Is he missing? I haven't seen him for two days. What does he do for a living, I mean? He's an actor, we both are. That's how we met. If you're an actress, what are you doing working here? A person's gotta eat. Besides, acting jobs are kind of hard to come by. Me and Johnny were like, you know, waiting for our big break. I had a couple offers, but those films were pornos. And I told them I wouldn't do it without Johnny. That's his big dream, you know. His dream is to be a porno star? How big was his dick? Huh? His shlong, his dong, you know, his peepee. Kapinski. The rate you're going, we'll be here all day. Well, he is pretty large. We measured him one time. He wants to be billed as Footlong. Get it? Yeah, thanks. Besides, why do you want to know that? What does that matter to you? We need to know for identification purposes. Identification? Something's happened to Johnny. He's dead, isn't he? Somebody's dead. But we don't know for sure if it's him. Lisa, if you could-- - It's him, isn't it? Lisa. [SOBBING] Lisa, please. Just a few more questions, OK? When did you last see Johnny? Um, Tuesday night just before he left for his job. [SOBBING] He had a job? Tuesday afternoon, some guy came in looking for Johnny. And he said he had this friend and he wanted to play a joke on him and he needed an actor. Johnny was supposed to drive through this intersection and pretend to be drunk and fall asleep at the red light. But he didn't have a car. The guy paid him 50 bucks and told him he'd see him at 9 o'clock. He left here about 8:00. And that was the last time I saw him. Well, why didn't you call the cops when Johnny didn't come back? I don't know. I guess I kept thinking he's turn up. Who gave him the 50 bucks? I don't know. I never saw the man before. Did Johnny know him? I don't know. No, I don't know. I don't know. Thanks. You've been a big help. Yeah, sure. Well, look at it this way, with old long dong gone, you can do all the skin flicks you want. Won't have to feel guilty. - I don't believe you said that. - What? God, you're insensitive. Oh, she's a throw-away. She's a human being, for Chrissake. I figured you'd say that. What do you mean by that? I saw you snuggling up to her over there. I guess you figure old long dong is gone, you'll swing her your way. You're sick, Kapinski. Yeah, I'm sick, shit. What's the matter with you? Got all hot and bothered. You're embarrassed because you got hot and bothered. I got hot? What about you? I saw you. I saw you sitting in there, squirming around trying to get comfortable with that bulge in your pants. You got hot, not me. Oh, you're sitting there, your face all flush, your eyes all glazed over. You are gross, Kapinski. Yeah, gross. How'd I get stuck with this creep. WORKER [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Pick up orders number 219 and 224. Thanks, hon. Well, as soon as we go back to the station, I'm gonna check out old long dong. It's my guess he's got a record on him. Well, it's the old, classic silent treatment. I love it. I love it. Put a lid on it, will you? I've about had it with you. Hm, you've about had it? Yeah, I've about had it. I've had it up to here with your chauvinistic, macho bullshit. It's enough to make me want to throw up. Why did you have to be gay? I don't ever remember being given a choice. [HORN HONKING] [SOBBING] [SCREAMING] [MOANING] [SCREAMING] [COUGHING] [SCREAMING] You guessed right. John Cassidy has a record. Well, let's take a peak. Looks like old Footlong was quite a guy. You should get some glasses. I do all right. He was arrested last year for lewd and lascivious, then again about six months ago for DWI. What did he do? He drove a car while he was drunk. What the hell do you think he did? No, the lewd and lascivious. Sure, he got caught flogging his dong in an adult bookstore. I guess when you're as large as he was, it's hard to hide. Well, you like to share it with the world, you know? The arresting officer for the DWI was Paul Murphy. So? So you never know, he might be able to tell us something. It's worth a shot. Ready when you are, Rocky. I thought you'd never ask. [CHATTER] Hey, guys, look at this. It's Larry Kapinski and his new boyfriend. What's the matter, Larry? Run out of straight chicks? You didn't think anyone else knew about it, did you, Kapinski? If I want any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head. Why don't you take your dyke girlfriend and go crawl back under your rock. Come on, Larry, let's go. Hey, forget about it. What's the matter? You not man enough for her? You got a wild hair up your ass? Larry, let's go. Ooh! You bastard! Come on, come on, come on! Stanko, do these look like the hands of a fighter? [GRUNTING] Hey, break it up! Come on, you guys. What the hell is going on in here? What is this? Kapinski, I want to see you. And Stanko, I'll see you later. Now! What the hell got into you, Kapinski, anyway? That wasn't a damn street bum. That was a cop. - He wasn't a cop. He was an asshole. - Stanko started it. Oh, so Larry had to finish it then, right? OK, Kapinski, everybody is on edge around here. Just cool it. Captain, I think you should know, Kapinski didn't-- Look, I've heard enough for today, all right? Kapinski, why don't you get out of here? KAPINSKI: Just watch me. Find yourself a woman, OK? Get drunk or something. Got a new phone number? Ha, ha! Hold on a minute, Andrews. Now, this incident between Stanko and Kapinski, we put you two together to keep this sort of thing from happening. Captain, I don't think you understand what happened out there. I don't care what happened out there. You know, he can be a rotten human being, but he's a damn good cop, the best I got. Now, if he gets mixed up in this sort of thing, the chief's gonna have him out at the airport directing traffic for the next 20 years. And he couldn't take that. He'd quit. And I couldn't take that. I like the guy. He'd back a friend all the way, with his life if he had to. You know, there's something to be said for that. I guess there is. OK, captain, I'll do my best. Thank you. Hey, and maybe I can put you two together permanently. Don't push it, captain. Go on, get out of here. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] Kapinski! Come on, Larry, open up. I know you're in there. What are you doing here so early? Early? It's after 9 o'clock. You look like you just went to bed. No, I went to bed about 10 o'clock. Went to sleep about an hour ago. You remember what Samuels said? He said go out to get laid and get a broad. Did I say anything? No. What you do on your time is your own business. Personally, I've been working for the last six hours. You been with that Hunter girl? Trying to wean away from old long John? Lisa's dead. They found her body in the dumpster behind the strip joint last night. Another cop was killed. Who? Harold Jackson. You knew him? Only from the force. He was with me six weeks ago on that drug bust, saved my ass. I was about to take a shower. Be about 10 minutes. KAPINSKI [ON TAPE]: [MOANING] Yeah. Yeah. [LAUGHING] KAPINSKI [ON TAPE]: Ah, ma, ma, ma. Terry, Terry, you're beautiful, beautiful. God damn you! What's the matter? - God damn you! - What the fuck is your problem? You son of a bitch! What is it? Why? Why? What? You hate me that much? Terry! Ah! Do it, Kapinski. That's what you want, isn't it? That's what you want. God damn you, son of a bitch, do it! [PHONE RINGING] Homicide, Andrews. TOAD [ON PHONE]: This is Toad. Let me talk to Kappy. He's not here. TOAD [ON PHONE]: Where is he? - I don't know. What am I? His baby sitter? Try the local bar. You know where he hangs out. TOAD [ON PHONE]: I'll try calling him there. But if you hear from him first, tell him he's got to meet me at the old factory building on Roosevelt at 3 o'clock. Yeah, but what-- [PHONE SLAMMING] Gimme another one. Larry, don't you think you've had enough? You should know better. I'll let you know when I've had enough. Oh, yeah. OK. What is it? Another broad? No. No, I never got to first base. You were due for some time off, weren't you? See your kid in Colorado. It's been three years? Yeah, about three. I don't think he'd know me. He'll get to know you. Yeah? If he got to know me, he may not like it. People change, you know? Yeah, I know. When you lose it. What's that? When you lose it, I guess. I don't know. I know what the fuck happens. I don't know. You work in the gutter, man. Yeah, but do I have to live in the gutter? That's why the kid is with her in Colorado. [PHONE RINGING] Mike's. It's for you. Toad. What's on your mind? It's big, Kappy. I got a line on your cop killer. Well, spit it out. Meet me at the old factory building on Roosevelt. I got something I got to show you. I'll see you there at 3 o'clock. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - What is it? - It's Kapinski. He's walking into a trap. I'll fill you in over the radio. Get ready for backup. Meet me at the old apartment house at Roosevelt street. SAMUELS [ON RADIO]: What the hell is going on? Paul Murphy is the killer. A cop? Where'd you get an idea like that? ANDREWS [ON RADIO]: Every cop on that drug bust with Kapinski is now dead. Paul Murphy's brother was killed and Murphy pulled two cars out of the police impound. I found them listed on the inventory sheet. John Cassidy, the John Doe that was burned in the car, was arrested by Murphy six months ago. Supposition. It's based on circumstantial evidence. You got nothing solid. Look, Kapinski is on his way to meet Toad at the apartment building right now. If I'm right, Kapinski is next in line. And that apartment building is exactly where Murphy would take him out. ANDREWS [ON RADIO]: Listen to me, captain, Paul Murphy is trying to get even for his brother's death. And Kapinski is the only one left. He's got to be next. Now, do you want to take the chance that I'm wrong? No. Toad? Toad? Kapinski! You made it. Your gun. Slow, real slow. Over there. Hi, Murphy. Get up. Come here. The others are dead, and now it's your turn. Jackson, Rollins, Wexler, and Robinson, you're all guilty! But you, you, you're responsible! Your brother disobeyed orders. You didn't back him up. There was five of you. And not one of you came up here with him. He died up here alone, all alone in this building while five of his brother officers stood around outside doing nothing to help him! And now you're gonna die just like he did. It's your dance. [GUNSHOT] Get up! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Kapinski! [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] Drop it! I said drop it! It's all over. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] It's a chink in the armor, kid. Back up, I wanna-- I wanna see the clouds. Don't worry. He'll make it. [MUSIC - GARY STOCKDALE, "CAUGHT IN THE HEAT"] [MUSIC - GARY STOCKDALE, "CAUGHT IN THE HEAT"] [SINGING] Out in the light. There are shadows running from sight. Waiting till night to take you down. Everywhere you look, someone's playing with fire, burning up their lives. And I'm caught in the heat fighting for something that I can believe. I won't be just a part of the street. I know inside I will always be free. Still, I can feel it burn. Caught in the heat. Caught in the heat. How many days can I take the heat of the place? I keep searching for ways of holding on. Every chance you take, there is no right or wrong, getting what you give. But I'm caught in the heat. Fighting for something that I can believe. I won't be just a part of the street. 'Cause I know inside, I will always be free. Still I can feel it burn. Feel it burn! I'm caught in the heat. Fighting for something that I can believe. I won't be just a part of the street. I know inside I will always be free. Still, I can feel it burn. Caught in the heat. Oh! I'm, I'm caught in the heat.
