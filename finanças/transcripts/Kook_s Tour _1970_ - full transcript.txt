(upbeat piano music) (yelling) (exploding) (yelling) - Oh, oh, oh oh. - Oh. (gun shooting) - Oh. - Ow. - You cut the wire. (yelling) - Hi, remember us? That's how we made our living for 50 consecutive years. - Yeah we got scars to prove it. - And I still got a few of the aches and pains. - Yep, for a half a century we've been stars and suddenly we realized that although our weight took us around the world, we never got to see anything but the inside of our dressing rooms. - And what do you think we finally did? We quit. (triumphant music) (whistling) - Moose, here Moose. (barking) (upbeat music) (fast paced music) Whew, sure saved a lot of driving on those crowded highways. See this? This is a straw, a short one, and I drew it so lucky Larry is in Palm Springs relaxing at the pool. Pretty Joe's in sunny Miami visiting relatives and I'm here in the noisy city to tell you a story of our first adventure in the great outdoors. After we disembarked from our campground in the sky we headed right for the fabulous Lewis and Clark country in Southern Idaho and it all started with this walkie talkie. When I pressed the button and said Curly Joe, it's Moe, do you read me? - [Joe] Curly Joe, I read you loud and clear, over. - Pardon me, I've got to be careful with those old habits. Well the fun really started when I said to Curly Joe, Curly Joe, how am I doing? How am I doing Curly Joe? - Okay Moe, come on, back slowly, that a boy. You're doing fine Moe, fine. Keep it coming. You know me, I'm the navigator boy. Just leave it to me, I know what it's all about. That's it, come on back. Come on back there. - Okay Admiral Blimp. - Leave it to me boy, I know what I'm doing. That a boy, just come straight back. Atta boy, come on, come on slowly. Leave it up to me. That's it, come on, come on there. Oh, oh, oh. - He lost his hat, go get him Moose. (barking) (splashing) - [Moe] What's going on here? - He might drown. - Are you kidding? With all that blubber, he'll float. - I heard that remark Moe, it wasn't my fault. Somebody pushed me, right over there. - You just lost the ship, we launch the ship. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, launch the ship. That's a good idea. You read the instructions, I'll do it. - Instructions yeah. All righty, all righty. It says be sure and secure the bow line prior to releasing the wind scape. - Get the bow lines. - The bow line. - You're going to do the work, eh? - Come on, the bow line. That's it. Once the bow line is secure, release the winch and the boat will slide into the water. - Release the winch and the boat will slide into the water. - Right, that's it, that a boy. Okay, that's it. This line in the water there. Watch that there. - Bunch of excuses. - We got to get that slack up. Flip the lever. Imbeciles, for 50 years I've been surrounded with imbeciles and I'm still surrounded with imbeciles. Where's that fatso with the instruction book? Come here fatso. - Fatso. All right, I heard that, I heard that Moe. I used to get paid a lot of money for taking your insults, but no more buddy boy, no more, no more. - He's right, we're ex stooges, we ought to start acting like ex stooges. - Yeah. - Well, sometimes I, I, I, hey. Tell me you tied the boat loose. - Hey Moose, go get the boat. - Bring it in Moose. - He's got it, good dog. Can you believe it? 80 pounds of retriever, retrieving a 3,000 pound boat. (upbeat music) - Come on, let's go help him. Come on, give him a hand. Come on Moosey boy, we're going for a ride. - Okay fellas, everybody in their place, everyone be seated okay? - All right Moe, I'll check the... - Captain Moe please. - Okay, Captain Moe please. Okay first, blower on. - Blower on. - Okay, lower your prop. Start your motor. - That's a beautiful job Captain. - Thank you Lieutenant. - Okay now back slowly. Slowly Captain please. - Backing up slowly. Well there we were, finally afloat and following a trail made famous by Lewis and Clark on that magnificent river called the Snake. It was our first real taste of blue water and fresh air and believe me it was delicious. Here we passed directly under Massacre Rocks just a stone's throw from the famous Oregon Trail. Appropriately named because of a series of Shashoney Massacres during the early 1860's. This was a dangerous part of the Oregon Trail for more reasons than one. The famous Hunt Party traveling west and trailblazing the Oregon Trail itself, that was a disaster before rapids just a few miles from this very spot. And that was a few miles further than these three ex stooges intended to explore. So away we went, on Noris' End Street to the fantastic Jackson Hole country of Western Wyoming. Discovered by John Culver, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and preserved by a wise government. Grand Teton National Park remains a primitive masterpiece of nature for future generations. We had heard many stories about the famous cutthroat trout in huge Jackson Lake and were anxious to get started on our first fishing trip. Remembering vividly our recent launching experience at the Snake River we approached the ramp a Colden Bay with slow deliberation and extreme caution. (upbeat music) That's what I call a slight improvement. (barking) Moose really wanted to retrieve that boat again but National Parks have strict regulations prohibiting dogs in boats. Give us a push Joe. - Push away. (peaceful music) Boy, look at the size of those mountains, it's like the Swiss Alps. - [Moe] You don't know your Alps from your Teton. Now don't get nasty, this may get on television. - Very funny. Maybe my luck will be better in the back. Oh, ouch. Oh my aching head. Hey Larry, I got a bite. - He got a bite. Pull it in. You might get his head. - Here he comes over there. - Come on Willy, come on out of there. Hey, hey, good boy Joe. - Hey, watch it, watch the hook. - I did it, I did it. I did it. (upbeat music) - [Moe] It was just a short drive from Jackson Lake and we were at fabulous Yellowstone. Our first stop was Old Faithful Inn where we would headquarter during our visit to the park. - All right, get down, get down. - Take it easy. Isn't that beautiful, look at that? - [Man] Man, he sure is a big one. - [Moe] The crowds at the inn were marvelous. It took a full hour of autograph signing and reminiscing with old fans before we finally made our getaway and crossed the Fire Hoe River to visit the unbelievable firm spectacle of Upper Geyser Basin. The sights here at Yellowstone are mind boggling. Miles of eerie landscape dotted with steaming vents, bubbling mud volcanoes, scalding cauldrons, and boiling mounds. It was like exploring the surface of an alien planet. I'd hate to walk around here at night. You could get hard boiled in 30 seconds. - [Joe] You get a better view right over here. It sounds like my stomach. - [Moe] Your stomach never sounded that good. - That's a crazy way to make coffee ain't it? - How do you like him, always thinking of something to eat. (peaceful music) Ah, there, they're making all the bubbles. - You never saw nothing like that? - Wait a minute get the edge now, get the edge. It looks like a witch's broom. - The only place in the world that's got something like that do you know that? You don't know that, I know that, I know. - That's a geyser. - You must have read it to him. - I don't know geysers, it's fantastic. - We crossed the famous fishing bridge on Yellowstone Lake and we're on our way to one of the wonders of the world, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River. Here nature puts on a display that defies description. The park itself is named for the canyon's fantastic coloring caused by the forces of the river which gorge sheer cliffs out of volcanic rock to reveal a spectrum of views from pale yellow to brilliant orange and flaming red. How beautiful, that's gorgeous. - Let me get a picture of that. - Yeah, get a good one. - The lower falls plunges 308 feet between thousand foot cliffs. It's mist and the late afternoon sun combining to make the river below look like a silvery glacier. It's beautiful down there. - If it's so beautiful down there what are we doing up here? - Hey come on. You're just trying to be funny huh? - Come on Moose, Moose, take a look at it. See that, see that, that a boy. Get him Moose. (peaceful music) - [Moe] Poor Moose, somehow the whole miracle of nature bored him but the day was still young and ahead was an adventure he'd never forget. - That looks like a nice spot, right there. - Sorry old buddy, but we'll only be gone a short while. - You know the rules sweetheart, no dogs allowed in boats in National Parks. - So take a nap and enjoy the scenery, we'll be right back. - Yeah, don't go away. Stay there, that a boy, that a boy. (barking) - Stay there Moose, we just want to see the lake. - Be still and I'll bring you back a fish. - Relax. (barking) (dramatic music) (barking) (dramatic music) (barking) (upbeat music) - Hey, we've been out quite a while, how's the gasoline Captain? - I don't know, the arrow points halfway. I don't know if the tank is half empty or half full. - Oh, come on. - What are you doing them old jokes for? Forget the jokes, back to the marina and move. - Drive. (upbeat music) (barking) (growling) (barking) (fast paced music) (laughing) - I know what I'm doing, don't worry about it. - Boy oh boy, you look like a dirty lawn in the fall. - Very funny, you guys won't laugh when I get first prize for taking a picture of a deer. It's the only way to get a picture of an animal is to camouflage yourself and sneak up on him. - Yeah, well watch out for the bears. They're liable to think that you're a berry bush and carry your arm off so watch it. - Look. Come on. He's gone. - And there's wild bears here and moose. - Moose, we got to find Moose. - Yeah Moose, hey, you go that way, you go that way, I'll go this way. Here Moose, here Moose, here Moose. - Moose, here Moose. Moose, Moose? Moose, Moose? - Moose, Moose, hey Moose, where are you? Moose, Moose, Moose? - Here Moose. Here Moose, here Moose. - He must be playing the dog. - Moose, got to find that dog. Moose, Moose? Moose? Moose? Oh Moose. - Moose, Moose? Hi, any luck? - Nothing, not a sign. - Have you seen Larry? - Hey, come to think of it I haven't seen him in hours. - That's all we need, now we got to look for Moose and for Larry. - That's the way it is. - Here Moose, here Larry, here Larry? - What is it Moe? - You know, I give up with that idiot. Every time things go wrong he makes it worse. I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there now with a stick of dynamite trying to catch a fish. - Yeah, well we better catch him. - All right, there's somebody here. Hey Larry? Here Moose, Moose? - [Joe] Hey Larry. - Moose, Moose, Moose hey Moose? Where are you? Moose, I knew I'd find you. I'll show those guys who's the idiot. Moose, come here boy. (barking) Hold up, wait a minute. Moose. (barking) - Hey Curly Joe. - Hi Moe. - I quit, I'm pooped. - Yeah, this is terrible. There's no sign of him any place. - I found him, I found him. (barking) I found him, I found him. I found him, I found him. I found him. - Easy now, easy. - You found him? - Yeah, he found Moose. - Good boy, good boy. Come here boy. Glad you're back. - You're really a super duper Moose finder, you really are. (peaceful music) - [Moe] Poor Larry, for 50 years the scripts never let him do anything right. I guess it's become a habit. Moose finally recognized an old friend beneath all that camouflage and we headed back to the geyser fields for a gag we just couldn't resist playing. - [Man] Hi guys look, it's the stooges. Hey what have they got there? It looks like some kind of potty. - [Man] They must be crazy. (upbeat music) - [Man] You better get out of here, the rangers are coming. - Just 14 miles after a hasty exit from the west gate of Yellowstone we stopped to try our luck at Timber Creek, a small stream that flows into Henry's Lake and teems with native brook trout. Whoa there, easy now boy, easy. Ah ha, now that's what I call luck, first cast and pow. It ain't easy though, easy does it. Easy fella, easy now. Okay boy, come in here. - Moe, I'll get it. - Back up. - What? - I got it. - Have this one. - I don't want that one. - He caught the fish, it's only your pole. (yelling) - Get away from me. - What are you doing? - [Joe] Get away. - [Larry] I know what I'm doing, come on. - [Joe] Whoa boy, I got a good one. - Put my name on it, that's mine. - He belongs, you're mine, that's what you are. He's mine. - No he is not, he's mine, there. I finally got a fish. - You haven't caught a fish yet, get out of here. Help me get it back. - I finally caught a fish and he took it away from me. - [Moe] Moose was fascinated by the string of fish that Joe and I had caught and Larry, scoffed as usual had reached the peak of frustration. - I still say they're my fish. - Oh stop it even, you haven't caught anything since we've been out. For two weeks I've been telling you, if you don't hook them, you don't eat them. That simple. Poor Larry, it was if the entire trout population of Idaho was deliberately conspiring to drive him crazy. Feeling sorry for him, we headed for a famous fishing spot where he could at least look at trout. Big Springs, Idaho, and the unbelievable site of the Henry's fork of the Snake River. Bubbling up from underground and within yards becoming a full fledged river. Fishing is prohibited in this natural aquarium. In addition to its year round trout population millions of Kokanee salmon come each fall to spawn in its crystal waters. Put it down there. - Look at all those fish. - Oh boy, did you ever seen anything like that? No wonder they don't allow fishing. Look at that one over there, he must weigh eight pounds. Let's feed them some bread. - Hey, look at them grab it. Look at them go, he's starving. - [Larry] I'd hate to put my finger in there. - [Moe] Yeah, they're like the rabbits. - [Joe] I bet every fishing hole ever invented would work here. - [Moe] The red ones are Kokanee salmon. Look at them go. Hey Larry, get a picture. - He did something Moe? - Boy in a place like this even Larry could catch a fish. - You want to bet? - [Moe] Remembering Larry's skill with rod and reel, Joe backed out of his offer and we traveled downstream for a little diversionary boating. (upbeat music) Help, help. I'm out of control, I'm going into the bridge, help. - Hold on Moe, I'm coming. - [Moe] Help, help. - [Larry] Easy does it, easy does it, I'll get you. - [Moe] Help, hurry. For a minute there I thought... Look out you dumb skull. - [Joe] I'm coming Moe, I'm coming. - [Moe] Fat idiot. - [Joe] Sorry. - [Moe] By now Larry was determined to catch his first fish and he couldn't have picked a better spot. Henry's Lake is unquestionably one of the best cutthroat and rainbow lakes in America. Limits of fish up to 15 pounds are not uncommon. Larry couldn't wait to wet his line and 155 horses were speeding us to Stanley Springs, the hottest spot on the lake where good fishing and good accommodations lure sportsmen from all over the country. Toss the anchor Joe. - [Joe] Yes sir, Captain Moe. - Get your rods ready fellas while I maneuver the rest in position. This is it Larry, you're on the best lake in Idaho, so pay attention to your rod and let's see if you can finally break the ice. (upbeat music) Hey you, where we should be going without a bite, why don't you get some action? - Yeah, well this is very boring. - Yeah, why don't you fish with your hat then? - Ah, shut up, I think I'll go take a nap. - All right, so take a nap relax. Uh oh, uh oh. - Thought I had it but it got away if it worked. And Moose you haven't got a bite. - Whoa, easy now. - What is that? - Easy, I got something, Larry get the net. - I've got the net. - Hey boy. - [Larry] Bring him over here. - [Moe] Wait a minute, get that head there. Get him so he don't jump off. I hope I don't lose him. Come on there buddy. Whoa boy, look at him go. - [Joe] That a boy Moe. - Get him out. Easy now, he is fighting. That's a fighting fish. Hold still fella, hold still. Wait a minute. - I got one, I got one. I need some help. - [Moe] You got one? - Larry, I need some help. Watch him. Watch him, watch him, watch him, watch him. I got him, I got him. It ain't yours, it ain't yours, it's mine. - [Moe] Hey Larry help, I've got another one. - Okay, he's down there. - Larry, bring the net. Oh I got a fish. - That's all mine, huh? I'll take it. - No, Larry, you know how many times I... - Get him over here. - You know how many times I told you before. - I got a fish. - Please pay attention, will you please? - I told you I got a fish for you. - Look, I caught the fish Larry. - That's my rod. - Now take it easy, it's your rod, I caught it. I told you so many times, if you don't hook them, you don't eat them. I caught the fish. - I got to, I got to get out. Don't call me no more, I'm going to go to sleep. (upbeat music) - [Moe] As we left Henry's Lake, Larry's incomparable record was still in tact, a big fat zero. Our next stop was Red Fish Lake, one of Idaho's alpine jewels, nestled in the magnificent setting of the Sore Tooth Mountains. Just north of Sun Valley in Central Idaho, Red Fish Lake and the Stanley Basin are one of the state's top recreational areas. Cruising on these high mountain lakes is a boatman's dream. Miles of scenic, uncrowded waters, so crystal clear you can see the bottom 30 or 40 feet below. (upbeat music) This was relaxation and scenic. A far cry from the noise and grid at the city we call home. We could see fish below in the clear water but were content just to sit and soak up the fantastic scenery. Some of the Sore Tooth Mountains tower over 12,000 feet and the entire area, down at the snow capped peaks and alpine lakes, is known to many as the American Alps. Unquestionably one of the choicest camping and boating areas in the country and we were heading back to the marina for our first experience at outdoor camping. (yawning) - Oh, what a beautiful day. - Good morning Curly Joe. - Good morning Moe, good morning Larry. - Good morning. Hey, I didn't sleep a wink last night. - What was the matter? - I snored so loud I kept myself awake. - Ah come on. - Come on, we got work to do gentlemen. Curly Joe, please take care of the wood. Larry, please take care of the fire. - What are you going to do? - Nothing. - Don't strain yourself. - Oh come on. - Here Larry, hold that. - So began a typical, ordinary day in camp. Shaving in the fresh mountain air is something I had never experienced. It was a great feeling. Poor Joe, he was used to clubbed with those kinds of instruments, not using them. Sometimes a simple thing like combing your hair can get to be a habit, a bad habit. (upbeat music) Joe wasn't much of a woodsmen, but he did have one phobia, litter, and old fatso was constantly cleaning up the campground. (upbeat music) A job appreciated by all. Well, almost everybody. Hey those boys are lazy aren't they Moose? A little western music? No? Rock and roll? No, how about a little classical? That's what I like, a dog with taste. Come up here Moose, come on, listen and relax. Before long Joe had become a litter fanatic. I know you wouldn't believe this if you weren't seeing it but he actually rigged up a motorized campground, high-speed contraption. For lack of a better name and away he went, doing his duty for forest and country. Outdoors and indoors, he was determined that the wilderness will be immaculate. His was truly an immaculate contraption. (upbeat music) What are you trying to do, run somebody over? - You're a fine one to talk, do you know your tent rope was in my litter line and you're the guys I've been watching. You've been littering up the campgrounds, that why I was vacuuming the place and you're going to get in trouble buddy boy, I'll tell you that myself. - Why have you been littering? - The both of you, you're the worst kind of litterers. The ranger's going to get you fella, you'll see. Look what you did to my contraption. I was doing so good vacuuming the whole place and you with that tent, your stakes, you could have hurt somebody. Think I did it on purpose? Your tent pole was right there. (upbeat music) - Watch it, watch it, don't, don't. - What's the matter, what is it? - That's my new trap. - You've got to be kidding. - Wait a minute, I'll show you how it works. See the animal eats the fruit which pulls the string, which shuts that door and that string goes down, sets that trap. When that trap goes off it pulls this string and drops the rock down. When the rock drops down, the bucket of water goes up. When the water gets to the top, it tilts down and fills this cup and starts a see-saw. The candle goes up and it burns that string which drops that hammer, which releases the shutter and when the shutter goes down, the flash bulbs go up and you got the picture of the year. - What's that? - Picture of a deer, real live deer. - Now just relax Larry, just relax. Now we'll go get Moose and we'll all go to lunch before the man with the white coat comes. - Is he coming to lunch too? - Not for lunch, he's coming to grab you. Now let's go. - Well well look at that. The 21 club of the wilderness. - Who's the caterer? - The master chef, gentlemen, be seated. Sit down, sit. There we are and Moose you can join us too, right there boy. (thundering) - Get the table quick before we drown. - Hurry let's get this stuff to the camp. - [Moe] Larry out of my way, hurry up. (country music) - How's dinner coming Captain Moe? - Chef Moe if you please. - Okay, Chef Moe if you please. - Boy am I hungry. - Hey Larry, let's you and I set the table. - Yeah, it's safer there. - Oh boy, I can hardly wait. (peaceful music) - (whistling) Here boy, dinner. I need a whole rainbow trout coming up. Ready for it boys? There we go, help yourself. - Delicious, trout for me. - This is my plate please. - Oh sure Moe, there's two little ones for you. - That's for Moose. - Ah, ah, ah, ah, no littering, I'll take that. - You're right. Here you are Moose, some nice, fresh brewed trout. That a baby. - Hey Moe, where's my fish? - If you don't hook them, you don't eat them. Moose, have some. - Have some Moose, that a boy. - Atta boy. He knows a good vintage when he tastes it. - [Larry] There's nothing I like better than a tall glass of cool, red vintage. - I wish I was a dog. - Okay fellas, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Time to go to bed, atta boy. Beddie bye time. - We'll have to put some boost so I can slide you. - Wait a minute, wait, wait. This doesn't fit my personality. - It doesn't fit your belly either. - It's not my fault you were in my way. - I was in your way? Oh I beg your pardon. How? Now, into the tent. - Ah not that too, I slept in the tent last night. - You're going to sleep there again tonight, belly in the hole. Out, out, out. - Out, out, out, out, out, out, out. - Larry, finish up the dishes will you, you slow poke. - Out, out, out. - [Moe] And shut that door. - Shut the door. (romantic music) (upbeat music) - What was that? Fellas, what was that flash? I've been sleeping all alone and I... - I got a picture of a deer. - A deer, what deer? - Come on fellas, follow me. (upbeat music) - [Moe] By morning we were well on our way to northern Idaho and passing Arrow Rock Dam. This huge reclamation project on the Boise River cascades into awesome tired water that covers the entire area in a perpetual mist and creates a mighty turbulence below the dam that transforms the classic river into a facsimile of a stormy ocean. We drove by the beautiful state capital at Boise and headed due north to Idaho's pan handle and the fabulous fishing of Ponderay and Priest Lakes. - [Joe] Okay Larry, this is it, Lake Ponderay, your big chance. - [Moe] Yeah, Joe's right, if you can't catch them here you'll never catch them. Good cast. Hey Larry. - Look at that crazy retriever. (laughing) He thinks your playing ball Larry. Hey, you caught yourself a Moose. - Let go, will you Moose. - Here Moose, bring it back. That's it Moose, come on here Moose, come on baby. - That's in my view Moose. I'm never taking you with me anymore, that's it. - [Moe] Hey watch it Moose. - Go ahead, get them all wet, that's it. They deserve it, two wet guys. - He's got me crazy. - Why don't you just keep trying? He's bound to get tired. Poor Larry, he was really jinxed. Moose was literally driving him out of his mind. The bright float acted on his retriever instincts and nothing could stop him from doing his inborn duty. It was really funny, in the end, it was sad. - Now you stay Moose, this is the last time. Come here, come here. No Moose, no, how many times do I have to tell you? Now this is the fourth time, cut it out. Hey Moose, come here, this way, go on. Moose has got a fish. - That a boy Moose. Lay him easy now. - [Moe] That's it boy, hold onto him. - Don't hurt him. - What a fishing dog. Bring him in, you can do it Moose. - [Joe] Yeah, you can do it, just lay him easy. - This way Moose, that's my fish. Come on, hurry up. - Never mind Moose, never mind, take care of your fish kid. Never mind him, you do what you want, skin him. - He's a better fisherman then you are (laughing). - That's my fish, mine, my fish, mine. - [Moe] Moose had added insult to injury, while Larry's frustration reached past the boiling point. The experience left a bad taste in his mouth and he urged us to leave Ponderay and move north to the virgin wilderness of upper Priest Lake. Feeling sorry for him, we transported our boat north to Priest Lake and crossed this large seeming body of water on our way to the narrow passageway known as the Thoroughfare that connected upper and lower Priest. We sped to the very top of the lake and began searching for the narrow channel. The opening was well marked and we slowed to a crawl as we entered. The Thoroughfare has a serene beauty all its own that tempts you to take your eyes off the water as you try to keep a steady course over the natural, deep channel. One mistake and you're locked on the sand bar in this lonely, remote wilderness. The bottom is covered with large, submerged trees that can wreak havoc with a boat. Moose was appointed first mate and became my second set of eyes, barking every time he saw a strange object underwater. This is really a virgin wilderness, rubbing elbows with the Canadian border, the entire area is untouched by civilization and much as it was thousands of years ago. With each mile the scenery became more beautiful and the area more lonely. This was a last stretch just before the channel widens and enters up the Priest, the truly magnificent Wilderness Lake. We were the only boat in the entire area and this time Larry was positive that he had finally reached his spot. This was to be his day. It was also his last chance as we would be heading home tomorrow. With this in mind, we all fished diligently for three solid hours and then... - Hey, well Moe it looks like we got our lumocks. - What a day with rod and reel. Have a little patience my lad, one of these days you'll stay awake long enough to catch a fish. - Yeah, and all you need is a little skill, perseverance, finesse, know how, sportsmanship, and technique, again. - I quit. - How about that. - Uh, uh, uh, one for Moe, one for me, and one for Moose (laughing). We had to, we're the fishermen. - Poor Larry, five weeks on the greatest fishing waters in America and even his hat did three times as good as he did. Well maybe his luck will improve after we board our campground in the sky and head our rig for the inland waters of Japan. Sayonara. (upbeat jazz music)
