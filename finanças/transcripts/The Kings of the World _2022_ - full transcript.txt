One day, every human in the world fell asleep. And all the fences on Earth burst into flames. Hey, yo. - Don't do it! - Move! Get the fuck out of here! Oh yeah?

Here, take a look at this one, man. - How much for that watch? - Gimme 45… 40 grand is fine. - It'll look good on you. - No, for this puny thing? It's a bargain, sir! - Thirty grand. - Forty is my call. I'm not gonna give you more than 30 for that. - You're ripping me off. - Winny! - Thirty-five, tops. - No way! - You know what, man?

What's up? - Bro, everything okay? - What's up, Black boy? - Hey. - Look what I scored. - What happened to you there? Nothing, you know how it is. - Oh, bro, what the hell? - It's nothing, bro. - Yeah, it's nothing, kid. - Let's hang out. You were partying! Sit. Relax. Gimme the water. - Put that watch away, bro. - Relax, bro. Hey, you really scored, kid! - Show me your hand. - What's up, bro? - Hold it. - Easy, man, it hurts.

Good day. - Thanks, you too. - Negro, what have you got for me? - I've been looking for you. - Really, why? - The letter arrived. The Land Restitution letter you've been waiting for. I've got it right here, look. Look, addressed to Brayan Andrés, here it is. The Administration for… Read it out loud so I can hear. Can't you read? - This is how I read. - Read it out loud. It says, "Legal Notice." "Civil Circuit Court Number 12, under Ruling 252, grants land rights through the land restitution process to the victim of forced displacement, Gilma Ledesma." "This document hereby notifies Mr. Brayan Andrés Villegas Ledesma, as legal representative of the claimant, that he is to present himself to the Bajo Cauca Land Restitution Office with the documentation before proceeding to the transfer of Lot 351 located in Nechí."

We've got to celebrate Colombian style. - Negro, can you do me a favor? - What is it? The boys are exhausted. Do you have an empty room we can crash in? Do you have cash on you? Do you? The boss comes by once in a while. I can't do it. What would I tell him? - Yeah, I get it, Negro. - Okay then. God bless you. You made my day either way. You deserve it, honey. Rá, do me a favor. Don't let those boys hang out there too long. Okay, Negro! Watch it, or Negro will chase us out of here with a stick, man. -Man! You like this, huh? - Well… Okay then. Rá, brother! - Did Negro give us a room? - No, man. No room. Negro is an asshole, bro. Shit! - No roof over our heads tonight. - Negro is such a cunt! Nothing. Have a smoke, bro. It'll help you relax. Rá, you think that letter is for real? - You're still doubting, bro? - That's what it says. - I can't believe it! - How can you say that?

Culebro's fucked up. - Unbelievable. - What's the deal? - Tell us. - Negro said you're planning a trip. You can't leave me behind.

Go, Nano! - Oh! - Ah! That's it! I'm speechless, man. All those cows and land with no owners, no houses. I'm speechless. Shit, kid, all of that belongs to somebody. How could anyone own it? As far as the eye can see, it's all owned by someone. - See any houses? Anyone taking care of it? - Everything has an owner. - It's amazing. - What's that thing down there? - What? - Is that a mule? - What mule, stupid? - A mule? Can't you tell it's a cow? - Are you high or what? - You're crazy, dude. - Sere, hell yeah! - There's a fox there. - Seems like a horse to me, man. - You're doped. - Lay off that glue, Nano! - Take it away from him. Let it go. - Those cows have it a lot easier than us. - That's true, bro. I was thinking the same thing. But that's the life we were given! So, suck it up. - Come on, man. - You know how it is, bro. - Okay, let's go see life. - But you know what? - Hey, Nano! - Careful! Are you doped? - Hey! - Come on! Hey, man! - Speechless. - What? This is for real, bro. - Bro. - Come on, Nano. Let's go. - Awesome! - Come on, Culebro. - Man, this is awesome! - He's coming. Asshole. What's up, man? Feeling happy or what? - Watch out, asshole! - Whoa. Shit! - Swing it hard! - Shit!

That's good. It doesn't feel the same as the other hand, but I feel it. - But you feel it. - It moves on its own, dude. Fuck. Careful not to fall. How are you? Are you hungry? Maybe thirsty? Want some water? Thanks, ma'am. God bless you. Thank you. Good, thanks. FREEDOM AND ORDER Let's go inside, ladies. These boys turned out really shy! Dude! - Shit! - Soap! Fuck! Move away, asshole! - Hey, Culebro! - Drown him. Assholes. My Black boy! Scrub him. - His hair's like a sponge, man. - He's all clean now. - You're crazy, man. - Dry me up, dude.

Put it back, man. Ooh, man! She likes it! Fuck, she's enjoying it! - Be easy on the chicken. - Come on, man… She's tripping. That's right, man. We should let it go. It seems kinda… Oh, ma'am, God bless you! Easy, boys, there's plenty to go around. Thanks, ma'am. Eat it all up. It's made with love. You can have more rice or arepa. - God bless you. - May God repay you. God bless you, ma'am. - Nice breakfast. - Eat up. Thank you, dear Lord, for this food, and bless our food, amen. - Amen, bro. - Amen, brother. That's right. Hey, guys. The lady gives good blow jobs. You're such a loudmouth. - Eat up. I won't tell you anything again. - Next time, just shut up, bro. - Want some? - Oh, no, love, thanks! I don't do that kind of stuff. Honey, breakfast is ready. - What's up, man? - Good, bro. Eat up, bro. Come on. - And you, son? How old are you? - Nineteen. And very well-raised. Broad-chested. And you? - Where are you from? - From Apartadó. Really? Look, man… What do you have there? - They got him… - Easy, ma'am. - Oh! - Easy. Gloria, please bring me the iodine, some cotton balls, and bandages. How did you do this? Some asshole knifed me. I can see you're trouble, honey. - A troublemaker. - A real firecracker. - Really? - Yes. A little spark! Right? Hold this, and I'll put some gauze on it, some bandages. I'll hold it, kid. - It's an open wound, huh? - Yes, he needs stitches. It's nothing! Behave yourself, son, so they'll kill you last. - Yes, ma'am, I know. - You hear me? Now leave it alone. - Bro, why don't we just stay here? - What do you mean? Haven't you seen? These old ladies are real nice. - There are beds, blankets, a roof... - No… So, where are you headed, boys? - To Nechí, ma'am. - What's your business there? We're reclaiming some land, ma'am. - Who left you that land? - My grandma, praise God. - How will you get the land back? - The government is giving it back. - Really? - Yes, ma'am. The Land Restitution program? Yes, ma'am, praise God. You'd better not tell anyone where you're going or why. Things are dangerous there now. You're better off not saying a word. - You think so, ma'am? - Yes. Be very careful. What are you staring at, fucking Negro? - Show some respect, old man! - Who's the old man? We're not doing you any harm, man! Show some respect for the kid, old man! - The old man... - Chill, man. - That's enough, boys. No fighting now. - Is he crazy or just drunk? Adriana, take that customer out of here. He's nothing but trouble. - If he touches her, we'll show him. - Easy! No! - Calm down. - Ignore him. He forgot to take his pills. The old man's high then? The old guy's fried. There's a pond on the plains Where clear water bubbles up Beautiful, pure, and fresh Under an araguaney tree There's a pond on the plains Where clear water bubbles up Beautiful, pure, and fresh Under an araguaney tree That's why in my hut Everything is joy and sweetness Your tenderness covers me Your grace and your virtue! Together, you and my spring Adorn my plains Together, you and my spring Adorn my plains You seem to be beating us. This is great. I need a pill. Pills are always a winner. Oh, okay. Hey, Rá! In my own perfect world, you don't exist if you don't want to. I'd like to own a world. I don't wanna fall asleep. I don't wanna grow old. I'd like to be invisible, like a shadow. Freedom, with the eternal ones always present. Get your asses inside, motherfuckers! Get in, now! But why, sir? We've done nothing wrong, sir. We're just chilling. Shut up and move your ass! - Good evening, Father. - Good evening, Santiago. - God bless you, boys. - Amen, Father. - Amen. - Amen, Father. We've got five of 'em. Motherfuckers, we're gonna fucking kill you! - Where are you taking me? - Shut the fuck up! - Shut up! - Get up, you cunt! - Stay still! - Get him! Stay there, asshole! We'll fucking kill you all. Stop this! Let us go! - Turn him around! - No! - Don't move, motherfucker. - Asshole. - Silence. - Let him go! Let him go. We're leaving. Let me go! - This is all your fault! - What do you mean it's my fault? Unbelievable, man! - Relax, motherfucker! - Rá! - Rá, bro! - Fucking asshole! We were just fine where we were! Rá! - Motherfucker! - The papers, bro! - So, why did you come with us? - We were fine back where we were. Get lost, asshole! What happened to Nano should have happened to you! Rá! I lost the papers! I lost them! - You've got them! - No, I don't! - Fuck! No! - The jerk has them. - You've got them. - I don't have shit. - Give them to me! - I don't have shit! Motherfucker! I've got nothing, man! I said I don't have 'em! Shit, man! The papers, dammit! Rá, don't, bro! Let's go! Oh, unbelievable, Rá! Fucking Culebro took off with our food! Unbelievable, man! Come on in. Hand me the cups. Where are you headed? We're going to Nechí to reclaim a piece of land they took from my grandma a long time ago. You're taking care of those kids as if they were your own? Of course. They're my family. They've got no one. Neither do I, you know? We're all alone. We keep each other company, and I just want to take them someplace where we'll be okay, you know? Where we'll have what we need. Where nobody beats us up, humiliates us, or looks down on us. Where we can each do whatever we want. And fight for what we believe in. That's all I want. You think the government will return that land? Yes, I do. I have faith that it will. So, why do the men in charge around here leave you alone? They think I'm crazy. These lands have different plans for everyone, son. Have some, bro. They say water is the blood of this world. It's raining now, and with its tears, it showers the land. And with my blood, I shower the land. The river that has formed floods this valley. It carries away the memory of my ancestors. Yours. Theirs. Ours. The eager ocean awaits. The eager ocean awaits me. There is no harbor anymore. Hey! You're lucky the old man let you stay, you son of a bitch! You're still a fucking leech! All these lands are full of gold. That river over there will take you where you're going. It's a wild river. So, be very careful. Don't get yourselves killed, boys. THE PLEASURE IS YOURS Where the hell are we, Rá? Always acting like he knows everything! And he doesn't know shit. We should've left him behind. - Who does he think he is? - He's an asshole. - You wanna get killed, huh? - Give me the papers, asshole. Rá! Motherfucker! Let me go, sissy! - Let's fight, come on. - Let's do it. - Get off me! - You think you're a big man? What, asshole? - What the fuck? - You cut him, dammit! - Think the land and the gold are yours? - So, you're gonna kill me? - You think so? - You're gonna kill me or what? No gold for you! Give me my bag! Give me the papers. What gold, motherfucker? - Let me go! - This is crap! - I wasn't gonna take anything from you. - Let go of me! Fucking asshole. Shit, you're not gonna keep a thing. Dammit, man! Fucking leech! You're the leech, asshole! Culebro. Hey, Culebro! Culebro. Weren't you angry? Get up! Don't scare me. Fuck! Get up, man. Culebro! Brayan Andrés Villegas Ledesma. - Brayan Andrés? - Yes, ma'am. - Villegas Ledesma? - Yes, ma'am. - Did you bring the papers? - Here. Wait a minute, please. Here. - Is that all you've got? - Yes, ma'am. - Who is Mrs. Gilma Ledesma? - My grandma. Your grandmother. And who are they? Are they family? They're my friends, but they're like my little brothers. They're my family. Your ID, please. LAND RESTITUTION OFFICE BRAYAN ANDRÉS VILLEGAS LEDESMA So, Mrs. Gilma was the victim of forced displacement and also the plaintiff in the case? Yes. Where are your parents? Well, my mom… she died. She died. And I haven't heard from my dad since they took the land from us. I've no idea where he is. My grandmother left the land to me. - Your grandmother left the land to you? - Yes, ma'am. - Which means you are the sole heir? - Yes, ma'am. Well, your mother's birth certificate is missing, along with her death certificate. Wait a minute. Brayan Andrés… the land is definitely yours. The court ruled in your favor. Though it's not that easy. What do you mean? Why? The ruling has been appealed. And although technically, the land is yours, there are several other lawsuits pending on those titles. So the case has to go back to court. I suggest you hire a lawyer, legal counsel. Basically, it's like starting the process from scratch. Well now… Ma'am, what do you mean? Is that all you have to say? Do you know how long I've been fighting for this? All the paperwork I had to do in Medellín just to get here! To claim what is mine! My grandmother died waiting for this, ma'am! Do I have to die too to get what's mine? I'm not asking for any favors! It's mine! I'm doing it all legal! I brought all the papers, and now you're saying "no"? I'm not stealing anything! It's mine! I came all the way here. I brought all the paperwork! To claim what is mine! Mine! What my grandmother left me! She fought hard to get it back! And she left it to me and no one else! It belongs to us and nobody else! What is this bullshit? Get serious, man! - Asshole. - Motherfuckers. Hurray! Okay, honey! Good! Bye, love. Hey, man! Rá… bro! Sere, bro! Sere, bro. Brother. - Rá. - Brother, come. Sere, bro. Rá, brother. Fucking shitty town. That was a shitty thing they did, bro. When do we get to our land, bro? Once we get there, we'll take revenge on this fucked up world. You said it, bro. TIRES Get over there! Get the fuck over there! Fill this thing up! Faster! Hurry up! - You need help or what? - No. - "No" what? - No, sir. Then hurry the fuck up! - Don't you dare call the police! - Take it easy. - "Take it easy"? - Everything's fine here. - Speak up, old man. - Relax, bro. Keep your mouth shut! We do solemnly declare that, from this moment on, we are all equal. From this moment on, no one shall have more than anyone else. No one shall be worth more than anyone else, and all men shall run free and wild. I am so strong because of my hate! I am so strong because of your hate! Rá, shit, man! Shit, they'll kill us, bro! This time they're really gonna kill us! Good afternoon, ma'am. - Good afternoon. - Hi. Boys, how can I help you? Ma'am, can you tell us how to get to La Sirga Lane? - What's in that lane? - Look, it's this piece of land. Honey, come here a minute! Can you help these boys? - Afternoon, boys. How are you? - Good afternoon, sir. - How's everything? - Fine, sir. - Isn't this the Ledesma's land? - That's right, I'm a Ledesma. You're Gilma's grandson? Yes, sir, she was my grandma. May she rest in peace. You're very close, son, but be very careful. You know this land isn't as peaceful as it looks. Yes, sir. We'll be careful. Nobody comes around here no more. No one comes this way. There's no one around. We're the only ones living around here. - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead, son. Besides my grandma, did you know my mom? - What was she like? - She was a lovely woman. We all loved her. From a nice family, she got along with everyone, with everyone around here when we still had neighbors. Both of 'em are sorely missed. - May God bless them. - Yes. Keep going, boys, until you reach a big fence. Cross it there, and walk some 10 minutes until you reach some fallen trees. You'll pass a big mango tree a little bit further, and that's your grandma's land. Up against a big hill. Thank you, sir. God bless you. Take this so you don't get hungry. - God bless you, sir. - May God repay you, sir. - God bless you, ma'am. - Good luck to you all. - Thanks. - Be very careful. Yes, ma'am. Fuck! They won't be looking down on us now! Let's go get what's ours, bro! Our time has come, bro! To defend ourselves. Winny. Do you see that horse over there? Of course I do. Why? What's wrong with you? - What is it, bro? - The place is full of gold, bro. Trying to camp out here, assholes? What do you think this is? You think this place has no owner? Think it's no-man's-land? Just because the boss isn't here? You think you can do whatever you want? Huh? Scram! Do we have to make you leave? This land has an owner. It belongs to my boss! This is no game, pussies. It's no game. Nothing to say, idiots? You're nothing but fucking trash! The other night I had a dream. What did you dream? I dreamed every human in the world fell asleep. Except us.
