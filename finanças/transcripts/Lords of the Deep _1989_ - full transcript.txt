(ominous music) (mysterious music) - Commander, what do you think's really going on down there? - It's hard to say. One of their researchers, Claire McDowell, do you know her? - [Crewman] Nuh-uh. - Anyway, she found something she shouldn't have. - And no one is saying what it is? - Nope. They must be threatening to someone or we wouldn't be going there. (ominous music) (loud hum) - Trilby, what happened to that comlink? - [Trilby] I am working on it, Commander Dobler. - Sometimes, I think your programmed for everything but speed, Trilby. - [Trilby] I am trained for speed too, Commander Dobler. - [Woman] Martel Incorporated. - [Stuart] Stuart Dobler. - [Woman] Please standby for voice print identification. - Stuart, any word from the replacement crew? - No, sir, and frankly, I'm getting a little impatient. I think I'm starting to develop gills. - Well, we may have to strip you of your rank and start using you for experiments. What about the others? Are they anxious to return to the surface? - Some. The maintenance crew is fine. Your researchers, though, are taking it a little hard. It's like a blow to their pride, you know, to be replaced prematurely. - Tell them to have faith in their company. Martel has their best interests at heart. - Yes, sir. - Hipthong. - Hipthong. - Scrud. - [Chadwick] Scrud. - Thank you. Paperclip. - Paperclip. - You're not exactly fired, Barbara. I mean, come on, there is a difference between being fired and being replaced. - Right, Stanley. - Ah, just like Martel. You buy a chunk of the sea, build the world's most expensive undersea lab, and they fix us up with the world's cheapest whisky. (laughs) What is that? - This is great. This is a spaceship on top of a fire hydrant, sitting on a lily pad, and dolphins coming in with my little son. He's on it, right there. "I love you, Daddy." Mm. - What time is it? (sighs) - There's a moon. There's a moon right there. Do you like the colors? - I'll be right back. - Time to take your station. We're about 25 kilometers from here. - Yes, sir. Give me my link up, Trilby. - [Trilby] Yes, Mr. Engel. - Commander, we have our connection with Martel. Use channel seven. - All right. - Hello, I'm Stanley Engel, second-in-command here on Neptune Base. How are you? - Okay, I guess. Actually, we're baffled. We have no idea what to expect down there. - You'll be briefed after you arrive. - You know, I've decided that there's no justice in the world, Jack. I mean, I come down here, I make the most amazing discovery, and then (exhales). I mean, it's just taken away from me. - Yeah, I know. My desire for the city's being taken away. We're all losing something. Listen, if it makes you feel any better, there really is justice in this world. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. If there were no justice in this world, you'd never be loved. (chuckles) - [Claire] Aw. - Whoops! - [Chadwick] And yet another tawdry shipboard romance. - Shocking. - Disgusting. - [Bobby] Mm. - Bye, guys. (laughs) (loud rumbling) (siren wailing) (loud rumbling) (siren wailing) - We're getting some interference over the transmission. - Do you feel that? - Yeah, I heard the quake. - Commander, I'm getting something on the sonar. - Reduce power, 50%. - Well, we've been having some earthquake activity the last few weeks. There's nothing to worry about, strictly minor stuff. (siren wailing) - What the hell is it? I can't get a reading on it! - Commander, what's going on?! - Engage all engines! Get me full power! - We're at full power! It won't budge! - [Commander] Okay, keep trying. - What is it? - I don't know, but whatever it is... I lost vibrational hookup! (loud hiss) - All communications are dead! We've lost contact! - Backups simply aren't working! Commander! The engines just went! - Oh, God! - Tell us! (alarm wailing) - [Barbara] Oh, God. (alarm wailing) (loud crash) (loud crash) (loud hum) (gentle music) - [Woman] Claire. Yes. - Sea scout. Sea Scout, come in. Sea Scout, this is Neptune Base. Come in. - Try the comlink backup system. - [Jack] You okay? Claire? - Trilby, give us a complete systems check. - [Trilby] One moment, Commander Dobler. The comlink radar signal has been deviated and there is damage to the exterior power lines. (groans) Maintenance crew, repair is required. - I've always liked a job with stability. Jesus, even the frigging emergency lights worn out. - You better jump in that pressure suit, pal. - Roll you for it. - [Both] Apple, peaches, pumpkin pie! - Rock smashes scissors, pal. - [Stuart] Everybody okay in here? - Yeah, fine. - We're fine. - [Claire] Yeah, good. Oh, excuse me. - Sorry to report that we've lost communication with the replacement shuttle. - Can't you pick them up on radar? - It's down. We'll get it back soon enough, though. Chadwick's suiting up to fix the lights. - Well, they could still be on their way, right? - Maybe, but we can't be sure. They're certainly not responding to our signal. - What was the last thing that happened? - I don't know. There was just something definitely strange about the last second of contact we had with them. - Stanley, what do you mean? - Well, the shuttle commander, he just looked scared to death, like, I don't know, like he'd seen a ghost or something. - Ooh. (group laughs) - Well, I'd say that's an appropriate reaction for an earthquake, wouldn't you? (gentle chime) There. There's Chadwick. (gentle music) No. No, I don't think we should wait. If something has happened to the replacement crew, we need to know about it as soon as possible. - On my way. - Thank you, Fernandez. (ominous music) - Ah, Red Dog One to Red Dog Leader, do you read me? - Very well. Now, Fernandez, I want you to start your search in the vicinity of Caucus Reef, understand? - Ah, that's a Roger Wilco. - [Jack] You're bleeding. - [Claire] Oh, it's no big deal, really. - Barbara. Barbara, could you take a look at this, please? - It's nothing. (ominous music) - Uh, approaching the reef. - [Stuart] You see anything? - Ah, yeah, yeah, I think I do. Hold on. (electricity buzzing) - Thank you, Chadwick. - All right. (ominous music) - Fernandez, the systems here have just been restored. - Are you receiving my external feed? - Trilby, give us a visual feed. No, Fernandez, the telemonitor's still down. - It's too bad 'cause you're not gonna believe this. The hatches are blown. I don't see any sign of the crew. - What? - I mean, I don't see nothing. - Bail out, Fernandez, come home. - You got it. - [Claire] I don't believe it. - [Barbara] What? - The sample, did you know, when it fell, it was all over the place, and now, it's back in one mass again? (loud hum) (gentle music) Would you look at this? Not only did it reassemble, it reassembled itself outside water. (gentle chime) - Must be Chadwick. Something must be wrong. Claire, medical kit. Tom, oxygen. Okay, careful, careful. Okay, Chadwick. Watch his neck. - Barbara, be careful. - Help me get his helmet off. (ominous music) Oh, my god. Claire, I don't know what it is. There's no hair. There's no bone. There's no blood vessels. There's no blood. His whole body just changed into some foreign substance. - You know, this is almost identical to the substance that I had been studying. Would you look? Look at this. - Yeah. - Did you dispose of the dive suit? - Yeah. But you know, there wasn't one hole on it, anywhere. - You sure about that? - Absolutely. - [Barbara] Would you give me a hand with this? - Sure. - Claire, what are you doing? - We're about to take samples. - [Stuart] Negative, I can't allow it. - Why not? - We have absolutely no idea what we're dealing with here. We cannot risk contamination. - We've already risked contamination by preserving the body. - What body? Huh? What you guys talking about? It's Chadwick. Where is he? Jesus Christ. What the hell's going on around here?! - Bobby, uh, come on. - Hey, don't tell me that! My best friend's in the sponge tank on display! The entire sub crew just disappeared! Now, what the hell's going on?! - What? - Bobby, come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. - Yeah. Yeah, let's trust in the business of science, huh? - Why didn't you tell us about the replacement crew, Dobler? - I was about to. - What exactly happened? - Well, your guess is as good as mine. The hatch was open, the crew gone. - Are you gonna send a second replacement crew down? - I can't. The signal's still down. But whenever Fernandez can pull himself together again, I'll send him out to repair it. - And have what happened to Chadwick happen to Fernandez? - Are you implying I would endanger the lives of my own crew? - What I'm saying is that what happened to Chadwick could happen to any of us. I mean, at least let us try to find out what happened. - It's their lives we're talking about, Dobler. Why don't you ask us if we're willing to accept the risks? - I don't think that's going to be necessary, is it? You're all siding with Claire? - Hey. I don't think it's a question of taking sides. - No, it's a question of insubordination. Permission granted, Claire. Go ahead, take your samples! Just don't say you weren't warned. - Let's get started. (ominous music) - Should we wait for a second replacement crew? - No. We should send Fernandez to retrieve the shuttle, and all of us just get out of here. - [Stanley] Yes, sir. I'll do it right now. - [Barbara] Trilby, can you check the oxygen level in here, please? It seems a little thin. - [Trilby] Checking. The oxygen level was low. I corrected it. - [Barbara] Thank you. Trilby, we're trying to determine how Chadwick died. - [Jack] Hey. - Hi. - Taking a break? - Yeah, for good. There's nothing more I can offer. - What do you mean? - That tissue isn't human, Jack. There isn't a trace of Chadwick in it. - What do you think it is, then? - I don't know, but it's alive. (gentle music) - [Trilby] Dr. McDowell is here to speak with you, Commander Dobler. - [Stuart] Let her in, Trilby. - You've already spoken with Barbara? - I have. - Well, then, I can only add this: The substance that I've been studying the last few days, it's identical to the substance that we found inside Chadwick's suit. - So? - I don't think what we've got is Chadwick in the next room. - You're out of your mind. - Maybe, and maybe you should go on over to the R&D room because whatever we've got inside that tank is mutating. In only eight hours, it's changed size, shape, color. Do you know what that means? It's altered its entire molecular structure for God's sake! - What does that prove? - "What does that prove"? Everything. Mm, uh, damage to environment. Request history of Neptune Base habitat. - [Jack] Damage. - Environment. Request history to Neptune Base habitat. - Neptune Base habitat. That's strange. I thought crew had total access on this computer. - Mm, yeah. We thought a lot of things. - Your ignoring the potential danger here. - I'm not ignoring the potential danger here. I just... Now, I know this sounds funny, but something inside of me tells me that that danger, you know, just doesn't exist. - I'd like to believe you. - Well, I could convince you. But I'd like to do it tomorrow. Mm, do you mind, baby? I'm so tired. (gentle music) (sighs) (mumbles) Where? (gasps) (loud hum) - [Woman] Claire. Claire, you were chosen. Yes. We need your trust. You will understand. (ominous music) (gentle music) (ominous music) (loud rumbling) (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) - Complete systems check, Trilby! - [Trilby] Yes, Commander Dobler. - [Jack] Are you okay? - [Claire] Yeah. You? (gentle music) - [Trilby] Commander Dobler? - Yes, Trilby? - [Trilby] The malfunction in the central generator is creating power failures. - Thank you, Trilby. Trilby informs me there were... My god. (ominous music) I'm going to have Fernandez retrieve the shuttle. We're all getting out of here. - Well, that's a good idea. - What about the creature? - What about it? - Well, are we just gonna abandon it? (chuckles) - I wouldn't exactly call it a member of our team, would you? - You are what you eat. - Knock it off with that. - It demands further study, Dobler. - Fine. The next crew here will study it. - By that time, it could be dead! - Whoever said an autopsy didn't amount to study? - I wouldn't call it equivalent! - Well, fortunately, you're not in charge here. One man dead, I feel I'm entirely justified in making this decision. Gear up, Fernandez. (ominous music) - So far, so good. - Good. - Hey. Good idea. Let's get drunk! - Catch up. - Cheers. Hey, listen. Don't you guys think Dobler's being a little tough on Claire? - Mm-hm. - Not necessarily. That thing could be dangerous. (gentle music) - Ah, come on, Tom. Dobler's getting personal. Just don't like the fact that we're being quiet about it. - You know something? You're absolutely right. (ominous music) - Fernandez, how far are you from the reef? - I'm approaching it now. Holy shit, what was that? Uh. Never mind. (sighs) I'm suiting up! Gonna enter the sub. (loud thud) - Fernandez, what's going on? - I got an angry fish knocking on my door! I'm gonna rewire the sub! Try to fry that fish! (electricity crackles) Think it worked. (laughs) Okay. Okay, I got two more coming back at me, straight at me. - Maneuver outta there! - Okay, I'm out of power, pal. - Go to your backup source. Fernandez! Fernandez! (screams) - I'm not sure how they got him, but they did. I've given Trilby orders to deplete the tank of oxygen and water. Would you hand these out? - What's this? - These are nondisclosure statements that you all have to sign. Once the replacement crew arrives and you're back on the surface, you're to say nothing about this discovery. - Who authorized this statement? - Martel. They prepared these forms in the event of something like this, something demanding secrecy. - Demanding secrecy? Dobler, this is a whole new life form that breaks all the laws of nature! I mean, the world has a right to know! - Negative, that can't happen. - Well, then, this is one area that Martel has no rights. You can replace me, but you cannot expect me to keep a vow of silence! - Then you'd better not expect to find work when you return, miss, from Martel or, indeed, anybody else. - Fine. (paper rips) (loud crash) (sighs) - I can't. I agree with Claire. - Ditto. (pen scrapes) - [Trilby] Commander Dobler? - Yes, Trilby? - [Trilby] I have completed the task you set for me. - Good, Trilby. Did the life form expire? - [Trilby] I registered a great deal of violent activity. I'm not certain if that indicates expiration. - Well, we'll just have to see if a great deal of violent activity indicates expiration. Engel, get me a weapon. (ominous music) It's gone. Trilby, do you have any impressions of the life form's location? - [Trilby] No, Commander Dobler. - How can that be? - [Trilby] If the life form were sheltered in the air passages or the water supply, it would fail to make an impression. - Engel, get everyone on for a search, and have them wear infrared so I can monitor their movements from the tracking board. Go. The track board, Trilby. (gentle music) (ominous music) - Trilby seems to think the creature is in the air shaft or maybe the plumbing. - Stanley, that means it could be anywhere on this base. - Yeah, I know. - It's all right? - It's all right. (suspenseful music) - Oh, my god. (screams) (loud zap) - A rat! How could a rat survive down here? I can't explain it. - I don't know. I don't wanna find out. Come on. (lights buzz) - Here with the lights again. - [Trilby] Dr. McDowell? - Yes, Trilby? - [Trilby] Would you make an inspection of the R&D room? I am picking up impressions there. - Could be crew, Trilby. - [Trilby] No, the crew is elsewhere. - Oh. Uh, well, all right. I'll be right there, Trilby. - No, no. You stay here. I'll go check it out. - Okay. Good luck. Okay. (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) - Trilby, open the doors, please. (suspenseful music) (yelps) Uh, let me out, please! Open the doors! Open the doors, Trilby! (gasps) - [Trilby] Attention, all crew. Please report to the R&D room. (gasps) - Jesus, what happened? There's no evidence of trauma. Jack, I need my gloves. - [Stuart] Barbara, don't touch him. - What would you like me to do? - [Stuart] Expel the body. - What are you talking about? - What, it's probably been contaminated by the life form. - Goddammit, Commander! I've been hired to do a job, let do it. I have to examine him to know what happened. - No, I forbid you to conduct an autopsy! - It's the only way we have to know how this thing operates. - Wait a minute. Where's Claire? She was with Seaver. Where is she now? - Engel, go check the tracking board. - Yes, sir. (gentle music) - Come. - This is a whole new life form that breaks all the laws of nature! - Come with us, Claire. - [Claire] The world has a right to know! I just, now, I know this sounds crazy, but, I mean, something inside of me just tells me that-- - [Woman] Yes, we welcome you. - [Claire] I only know that something is out there trying to tell me something and I-- - [Woman] And welcome you. - [Claire] This is a whole new life form. Could it be-- - Trust your inner vision. - Some intelligence-- - Trust. - [Claire] The world has a right to know! - Follow. - Breaks the laws of nature. Could it be that there's some kind-- - [Woman] Follow. - [Claire] I only know that something is out there, some intelligence going on. - Follow and you'll find us. - Gotta go find out what it is. - There's no sign of her floor plan. - Screw the floor plan. Trilby, do you know where she is?! - [Trilby] Her last location was Corridor 2, the washroom. - For the safety of the crew, I have to do this. - Barbara. Seaver's gone. We need to find Claire. Please? - Claire? - Claire? - Claire? Claire? - It's me! Don't shoot! - I was worried to death about you. - I need your help. Now, I don't expect you to understand. The creatures have established a colony on the ocean floor. - You're gonna go there? - I gotta go there. - Seaver's dead, Claire! - Oh, my god. How? I only know that something is trying to tell me something out there, and I've got to go out there and find out what it is. What? - Will you come back? - I gotta hope so. Now, would you help me? (gentle music) - Trilby? (loud zap) - [Trilby] Attention, all crew. Please report to the washroom on Corridor 2. Mr. O'Neill is engaged in contact with the life form. - Jack. God, not again. (gentle music) - Well? - He'll be all right. - Good. Engel, help get him to his room. Barbara, it'll be safer for you if you stayed there with him. Call me when he comes to. (gentle music) - I didn't fool you for a second, did I? (chuckles) - Jack, I'm a doctor, you can't fool me. What are you doing? (sighs) - Did you examine Seaver? - No, I never had the chance. - Do it. We need to establish exactly what happened to him. - Jack, what is going on? - I'll explain to you later. First, please find out exactly what happened to Seaver, okay? - Okay. And then where do I find you? - Computer Annex, there's a classified document out there that might explain a few things. - Engel! Any sign of Claire?! - [Stanley] No, sir, not yet. - Well, keep looking! (gentle music) (loud thud) - Okay. (console beeps) (gentle music) - [Man] Claire, over here. Over here. - Who's there? - [Chadwick] Chadwick. - Chad... Chadwick. My god, that's you. You're alive. - And kicking. (both laugh) - [Claire] Oh, my god, that's incredible! (laughs) - Look, I hope the goo in the suit wasn't too much of a shock. (laughs) - Yeah, well, why did you have to do that? - It was the only way they could penetrate the lab. They needed to find someone who would listen, and you were the one, Claire, right from the start. - Broken blood vessels indicating possible... Trilby, check the oxygen level of this room, please. - [Trilby] Yes, Dr. Stoudemire. - Broken blood vessels indicating possible asphyxiation. Asphyxiation. Trilby, did you have any orders to deplete the oxygen in this room? - [Trilby] I am checking the room. - I mean earlier. Dr. Seaver died from lack of oxygen. - [Trilby] I received that order earlier. - Trilby, you're programed to disregard any such orders. - [Trilby] An order from the commander overrides all others. - Oh, my god. (doors whirs) Trilby, open that door. Trilby! (coughs) Trilby, open the goddamn door! (breathes heavily) Trilby! (breathes heavily) Trilby, please, open the door! (gasping) Trilby! (gasping) - Crew Commander: Project Sweep? Define Project Sweep. Code name for the Martel Project referred to by the US Government as Project Neptune? - They're pretty much indestructible. - What, they're indestructible? - Yeah. It's like if you blew them apart, all those little pieces, in time, would come back together again and form one being. That's what they really are, you know. - One being? - [Chadwick] Yeah. Come here. See this? - Uh-huh. - Same stuff you were studying in the lab, only it's hardened. It never dies. Think of it, it gathers plankton, absorbs light, and oxygen is the byproduct. - That's how we're able to breathe in here. - UFO? - What do they want from us? - They want us to survive. They wanna teach us balance. - We need that balance to save ourselves. - Yes, except time is running out. - [Claire] Is that a prophecy? - No, it's a certainty, and I'm not just talking about the Earth. I'm talking about the lab. Now, we've got a number 10 shaker coming in here, could happen anytime. You have got to get back to the lab and get everybody out now. - [Stanley] Commander Dobler. - Did you find Claire?! - Um, no, sir, not exactly, but I did find something. There's a mini sub missing. - What? - She's gone, sir. Yes, she's gone, I don't know. I don't know where she went. - Stay put, Engel. We'll see what Mr. O'Neill knows about this. Jack. Where is she now? - The alien colony? Oh, we can call them what they really are now. Aliens. - Well, I'm glad that she's there with them. She can lead us right to the nest and then-- - Exterminate the aliens? (chuckles) - Listen to me, Jack. 70% of the Earth is uninhabited, the rest is gone to hell. We used to have something called the Ozone, Jack, remember? And now, people can't walk outside without suffering second-degree burns. (chuckles) Thank God, Martel is offering us a future. - Claire says the aliens aren't hostile. - Martel sends down a crew, especially trained to handle this situation, and what happens? They are consumed by Claire's friendly aliens. - We don't know that. - Of course we know it, you idiot! (loud clatter) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (loud clunk) Engel. - Yes, sir? - I need you to make a search for Claire. - I already did that, sir. - I mean outside. I've got to establish her whereabouts! - [Stanley] Why, sir? - There are no whys! Get in that mini sub and make your search! That's an order! - Yes, sir. (gentle music) - Any sign of her yet, Engel? Engel! Engel! - No sign of her yet, sir. (loud thud) (loud thuds) Oh, my god. They're coming for me, sir! (loud thuds) I told you! They're coming for me! - Shh, Stanley. Stanley, you got to remain calm, you understand me? (panting) - It's all right. I'm going to talk you through this. I'm gonna take care of you, Stanley. Are you listening to me? (loud rumble) Can you hear me?! Engel?! (static crackles) - [Woman] Martel Incorporated. - I find it remarkable that you are able to eliminate every single person on your crew and still miss the one you set out to get. - Oh, well, sir, I'm sure the aliens have taken care of that. - You can't be too certain. And you created additional problems by taking unauthorized action. - I did exactly what you told me to. - Now, we both know that isn't true. I authorized the removal of Claire McDowell, not the others. - It was necessary. - Was anyone aware of our conversations? - No, sir, no. They all believed that the comlink was inoperative. - Good. I want the next crew to think the same thing. - I understand fully, sir. Consider it done. - You won't have to worry. I'm dispatching a new commander with the next crew. You'll be returning to the surface. - You can't be serious. - You've been a good company man, but it just has to be. That's it. (console hums) (sighs) (gentle music) (loud thud) (doors whir) - You look like the last man on Earth. - I have you to thank for that. - Look, there's a massive earthquake due here any minute now. Now, I've seen the creature colony, and they prepared a safe place for us. - And you think you'd be doing me a favor by taking me there with you? - I'd be doing you a lot more than that. - This lab is built to withstand virtually any earthquake. - Not if it occurs directly beneath the lab. Look, are you coming with me or not?! - I'll come with you. - All right. Look, where's Jack? - Computer Annex. - [Claire] And Barbara? - Check the R&D. - We're leaving in five minutes! If you're not there, we're gonna leave without you! - Let me know where she is at all times, Trilby. - [Trilby] Yes, Commander Dobler. (coughing) - Jack! Oh, thank God, you're all right. Oh, God, you're hurt. - [Jack] Dobler. - We gotta get outta here. - [Trilby] Dr. McDowell is in Corridor 2 with Mr. O'Neill. - They're all waiting for us. Fernandez, Chadwick, Engel, they're alive! - [Jack] Alive? (screams) - Trilby, why'd you do that? - Proceed to close all openings on Corridor 2, Trilby. - [Trilby] Yes, Commander Dobler. - He's gonna cut off our air. - What?! - Come on. - [Trilby] Corridor 2 is completely sealed off. - Good. Deplete all oxygen on Corridor 2, Trilby. - Open the door, Trilby! - [Trilby] I have other orders. - I wanna speak to Dobler! I wanna speak to Dobler! - [Trilby] Dr. McDowell wishes to speak with you. - Ignore her. - [Claire] I wanna speak to Dobler! Open the door! - Stay back, stay back, stay back! (grunting) (loud thuds) (gasps) (Jack coughs) (gasps) (coughing) - What are we gonna do? (coughing) - [Jack] Kill Trilby. (grunts) (grunting) (loud thuds) - What's happening, Trilby?! (gasps) - [Trilby] There is another body approaching Dr. McDowell. (gentle music) (inhales loudly) - Who the hell could that be? (breathes heavily) - [Trilby] The other body appears to be the life form. - Good. We'll take care of that too. (grunting) - [Trilby] Mr. O'Neill is in the main computer room. (grunting) (electricity crackling) (alarm wailing) Mr. O'Neill is disconnecting me. (grunting) (electricity crackling) Commander Dobler. I am dying. (panting) - [Claire] Oh! - [Jack] Oh! - Oh, you all right?! - Yeah, you? - Oh, yeah. Come on, let's get outta here. Shh, listen. (loud rumbling) (alarm wailing) Get outta here, quick! (groaning) (screaming) (loud thud) (groans) (loud rumbling) (grunting) (loud thuds) (groans) (loud thud) (loud thuds) (loud thuds) (groans) (screams) (loud hissing) (electricity crackles) (loud thud) (electricity crackling) (grunts) (loud clunk) (groans) (grunting) (groaning) (electricity crackling) Are you ready?! - Yeah! (loud cracking) (loud rumbling) (gentle music) - [Woman] There was a planet spinning silently in the vast stillness of space. It was different from other planets because it had water and could sustain a fragile miracle called life. Through the course of evolution, one creature acquired superior intelligence, enabling him to dominate the planet. He abused the gift. He became selfish and violent. He would not cease to exploit every miracle provided by nature. Eventually, the tiny sphere could no longer sustain the life that once flourished there. That planet, which was our home, still spins in space, but it is cold and barren and completely lifeless. Learn from us. We have escaped and traveled here to Earth where the water is plentiful. And now, your race is hurtling down the same destructive path to oblivion. Stop your poisoning of the sea and the air and the land. Stop now so that the Earth can heal. Recover your essence as the miracle of creation, and together, we shall fulfill the destiny of our lives and thus, all life in the universe. (groans) (sighs) - Oh, we made it, baby. Come on. Look who I got. (Claire laughs) (groans) (Claire laughs) Get outta here! - [Chadwick] Hi, how are you? (group laughs) - Big surprise, huh, pal? - Jack, glad you're here. Glad you made it. - [Bobby] Hey, come here, I want you to meet somebody. - [Claire] How you doing?! - [Man] Aw, man, it's good to see you. - You were right all along. (sighs) - No, they were. (gentle music)
