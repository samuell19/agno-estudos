Let's tell her what happened last week. - Yeah. - All right, listen to this. - Listen, listen, listen. - Oh, God. So last week we had a great idea. - Okay. - To do a prank. - Okay. - All right, so people were walking by, I would come out, jump, and be like and they would get scared, right? Oh yeah, that's real original. It's a good prank. Hey, Anna. If you have one. Seriously, Matt? - What? - She's a kid. What? You just offer alcohol to all children? All right, anyways. So I'm jumping out every chance I can get to scare people, right? 'Cause we're trying to get some footage for YouTube. That's how you get paid nowadays. What was that exhale for? What do you mean? She doesn't understand, she doesn't understand. We're gonna be big time, all right? - Listen. - Listen. Have you been on YouTube for the last like- - No because I don't care. Well in that case you wouldn't know because pranks are big. Moneymaker! Most people do it in a stupid way we wanted to do it in a way that would actually add some kind of professionalism. Exactly. Stupid makes money, lots of views, and that's how money is made. - The point is- - She doesn't understand - the magic of- - No, I don't understand. Do you guys hear that sound? Because it's like dumb and dumber coming at you with a camera to put on their YouTube channel. Someone moaning. - She does not understand- - Guys! I do understand how YouTube works! Please explain to her, please explain to her- - Guys! There's somebody on top of the roof. Whoa. - What the hell? - Is he drunk? What is he saying? Hey! Why? Why would you yell? I don't know, he's just walking around. Well now he's looking at us. Why does that matter? It's creepy. What do you think he's doing up there? He's high as hell. Oh! Fuck. Come on! Come on. Fuck, fuck! Oh, God. Shit, he's alive. Fuck me. Oh shit. Kill me. Just kill me. Oh, we should not be here. I'm calling 911. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be... Hi, um, we need an ambulance. Yeah, at the community center. She's calling the cops, all right? They'll come, they'll take care of it. Let's just get outta here. No we wait for the fucking ambulance. They're gonna know we were drinking, man. We shouldn't be here. The kid is dying. Do you think they're gonna give a shit? Fuck, Matt. He's trying to say something. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Hey, you guys hear that? The police are coming. We should get outta here, let's go. Let's get outta here! Hey! What are you doing with Katy and her friends tonight? Probably just hang out. You can stay home alone, you know. You're old enough. Yeah, I know. You wanna talk a little more about what happened yesterday? I really wish you wouldn't of seen that boy. I'm fine. I know you're fine. I'm trying to be your mother. Let's hang out tomorrow. I don't work. Did you hear what I said? Anna. Yeah, sure. Goodnight. Night. Be careful. Last time I waited this long for a joint I was in the womb. Seriously? How many times do I have to tell you not to do that to her. Sharing is caring, Katy. - Oh, my God. - I don't want her to feel left out. She's 13. Don't take things from him and don't tell your mother. I wouldn't anyway. Good. Katy's wearing lipstick tonight, eh? Looks nice. You wanna borrow it? So I looked up the Queen of Spades. It's Russian folklore, it's like Bloody Mary. So the thing is you need a mirror and then the Queen of Spades from a deck of cards and you turn off all the lights and you take the card and you place it against the mirror and then you light a candle. You get red lipstick, and then you draw a door on the mirror with a staircase that leads up to it and then you say, "Queen of Spades, show yourself" three times. And then what? And then you get a wish. That's so stupid. Okay, so you mean to tell me, right, the kid that jumped off the roof, that was the reason? Yeah. Who was the Queen of Spades? Well, she was this rich Russian lady who went broke in the 1800s, and to get money she started an orphanage and she'd take all these kids into her mansion and she'd collect money from the government for it. But instead of, you know, caring for them she would kill them. That's fucked. Yeah, and then when the town found out they all stormed her house and they grabbed her and they pulled her out onto the street and they brutally tortured her. They burned her with spikes and they slit her wrists open and then they threw her into a lake so she would drown. Hey man, that's cruel. That's actually pretty cruel. What happens if you call her or make this wish? That's a good question. Well, the legend says that if you call her she'll appear and she will grant the wish if she's at peace, but if she's not then she's gonna cut you when you sleep or she'll drown you when you're awake. And she can haunt you until you lose your mind. Sounds fun. I say we do it. Do what? Let's call her. - No. - Please, can we call her just to see what happens? What, you think you're gonna jump off the roof? Shut up. How long as she been dead? 1800s? She's long been at peace. She's snoozing. And it's almost midnight, right? What do you think? I don't know. I mean, it's up to Katy. - Come on. - I said no, I don't wanna do this. - It's not up to you. - Why not? Because the website says if anybody's going to do it it has to be the youngest one in the group. That's Anna. Says who? This website? Yes, the website. Well, that's bullshit if you ask me. I'm not asking you. You guys wanna summon a fucking demon for what? For followers on YouTube? Ghosts. What's gonna happen when she comes and haunts you? And then when you guys end up fucking dead? I'm not gonna save you. Come on, she might be friendly. I'm just saying it's a bad idea. You actually believe this. Yes, you do. All right. Yeah, Anna, you can make a wish. Come on, Anna. Don't be like Katy. Any wish you want and it could come true. Anna, Anna, Anna. Anna, Anna, Anna. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. I want to. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Louder. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Did you see her? - No. - Just give it a second. What was that? Go see what it is. No. Fuck. Are you kidding me? Are you happy now? God, you guys are fucking assholes. Hey. What's wrong? Bad dream. Oh. I'm sorry I wasn't here for you. It's okay. Why don't you get some laps in the pool, hm? You have a meet coming up. Do you wanna come? I gotta get a couple of hours of sleep and a little bit of work from my class. We'll hang out later, yeah? Hey. You said we can hang out today. Anna. Where are you going? To do some laps. You're obviously too busy for me. Well, I can study while you swim then. Don't bother. I am only doing all of this to make our lives better. You want some? The cops called my house. About the kid? Yeah. Wanted to know what he was doing before he jumped. If he said anything to us. What'd you say? Nothing. Hey. Katy, are you ready to go? Yeah. Matt, are you coming? Matt. I gotta do something first. What? Jesus Christ. Is your mom home tonight? No, she's working. We gotta talk about what happened the other night. I'm going swimming. Why aren't you talking to Seb or Katy? 'Cause Seb's not answering his phone and Katy's out. Can we please talk? We can chat in the elevator. I don't think that kid was a suicide. He jumped off a building. No. I think he was trying to get away from the Queen of Spades. Right. Listen, I was looking into more last night, okay? And I think she might be- - Be what? She might be real. Okay. Listen, I heard noises last night. Really? We live in an apartment building. I hear noises every night, okay? You're not special. No, no, listen. I have a mirror across from my bed, okay? I think I saw her. You think I'm stupid? No. No, okay? I apologize, all right? I'm sorry about what happened last Saturday, okay, but I'm being serious now. - You're lying. - No. No, I'm not. Then what changed? Look! Look. I've been marked, Anna. Have a good swim, Anna. Did you cut yourself to scare me? Is Seb waiting in the change room to like jump out at me or something? Jokes on you, I'm already changed. Anna. Idiot. Anna! Hey, idiot. You can stop that now. Stop! Somebody help! Please! Please! Get the defibrillator. There, get me that thing! All right, in my pant's pocket in the change room. My cell phone, call 911. Now, Anna! Charging, stand clear. Press flashing. Shock delivered. Charging. Press flashing. Shock delivered. Hi, sweetie. Hi. Hi. Sorry that I had to call you. That's okay, I'm glad that you did. I was in the lobby when the ambulance came. I told the police I was watching Anna for you but they want you to call them anyway. Did they leave a name or a card? Oh, uh, yeah. I didn't want you to get in trouble for leaving Anna alone all the time. What happened? Matthew collapsed by the pool. He had a heart attack. A heart attack? Yeah. He's 17. I know. Anna was the one that had to call the ambulance. I told her to get some rest. Come here. What are you doing awake? Hi. Why are you home? I came home to be with you. You know you can always call me, right? I just don't want you to lose your job. I'm so sorry to hear about Matthew. We don't have to talk about it now but when you're ready I'm here for you, okay? I love you very very much. You know that, right? I really wanna be around more it's just tough right now. Hey, hey. Your friend is dead. Yes. What do I do now? Did you really read my book? Yes. Did you read the part where I said to call on her? I read that after that we had already called her. Well now you wait till you and the rest of your friends die. No, there's gotta be something that we can do, right? Something we can try. I told you everything in the book. Ultimately, the Queen of Spades will possess the one who drew the opening and summoned her into our world. There's a way, right? There's a way that we could stop her. You said this in your book, you said there was a way we could stop her. It is a theory. It was too dangerous. All I can tell you is to cover the mirrors in your house. She gains strength from them. Wait. There's... Listen, there's gotta be something. Just give me, I don't care how dangerous it is, we're gonna... There's something, right? Just give me something to try. I wish I could help you but it's too late. Goodbye. Hey. Can I come in? I just wanted to thank you for calling me and taking care of Anna. You already did last night. Is your mom home? No, she's away for work. Anna said you and the others played a joke on her. It was the guys, I was just there. Okay. What happened? Um, they read a story about a woman, one of these ghosts that you call to through the mirror or whatever. And they made Anna recite a spell and then Matthew jumped out at us and scared us and that was it. It was stupid. Is that why you've all been covering up your mirrors? One sec. He answered me, that guy that I texted you about, he's got an idea about this. Come on in. Hi. What are you talking about? Anna told her. Oh, okay. Well, he said that we have to make her an offering. I want you to stop teasing her. No, not Anna. The woman in the mirror. What woman? What exactly is going on here? He thinks the Queen of Spades is real and that she killed Matthew. Matthew died, Anna is terrified and you're continuing on with this joke? It's not a joke. It's not a joke, okay? It was a joke, but it isn't. It's not... Who is this man? His name is Smirnov. Okay, I found him online, his son was killed by this Queen of Spades. He wrote a book about it. And? And he has theories on how we can talk with her and how to get rid of her. Okay. This is ridiculous. You know what, I have it on video, okay? I have the whole thing, I have us calling this... Forget it. - I have to go to work. - Yep. If I catch you scaring Anna like this again I'm gonna talk with your parents. No more ghosts. No more blankets over mirrors. This stops now. Well? - Okay. - Sure, sure. Can you watch Anna while I'm at work tonight? Please. Sure. Thank you. You need help with that? I don't need help. Why are you even here? Your mom asked me to stay. Well you don't have to. I'm not a child. Okay. Do you want something to eat? You're not my mother. Yeah, I know, I know. So you don't have to start coming over all the time now. I was just worried, that's all. That's all. Why? Because of Matthew. It was just a coincidence that he died after- - I know. Because that woman in the mirror crap is just a game that the boys wanted to scare us with. Okay, well, if it was just a joke then explain what happened to Matthew. Who's this Russian guy? Maybe they just made him up. Really. Even if they did make him up, it's okay to be scared. I just can't believe we're going to Matthew's memorial tomorrow. Anna? Anna, come out, please. She's here. Please, Mom. Help. Don't go in there. Don't listen to her. It's not me. Please help me, Mom. Please. Don't listen to her, Mom. I love you. You were screaming. I had a bad dream. If you don't wanna be here it's all right. No. It's okay, I wanna stay. Why don't you sit down? I'm just gonna take a minute in the bathroom. Okay. Hey. You frightened me. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Miss? Are you okay? I need to show you both something. Holy shit, Seb. Quiet, please. That's the same one Matthew had. I'm marked. Hey, are you all okay? Yeah, just never been to a memorial before. This wasn't a heart attack! This boy was killed. She did it to him! - She killed my son, too. - Please, you need to go. You wait. You wait until your children are all dead. Please, let's go now. Sebastian. The other day you said you had a video. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Louder. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. What was that? Go see what it is. Are you kidding me? Are you happy now? God, you guys are fucking assholes. What were you thinking? You should know better. I know, but look at this, okay? I didn't see it at first but then I watched it back in slow motion. Look at that. You see that? You didn't Photoshop this? No, I didn't Photoshop that. Honest. What is that? Why do you have that? Remember I told you that there was this man? Okay, so we can talk with her but we can only ask her yes or no questions. There's no way this is gonna work. Let's just try it. So, to begin, each of us needs to offer something that belongs to them. Why? I don't know, I'm just doing what I was told to do. Where did you get that? Dad gave it to me. Now we call her. Queen of Sp... Sorry, we gotta say it together. Oh, you want us to hold hands while we do it, too? Ready? Katy, ready? Sure. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. What now? We ask her a question. What do you want from us? You said yes or no, you idiot. Is our offering enough to satisfy you? Can we satisfy you? Did you kill Matthew? Will you kill again? Katy? Fuck you. Me? Anna? Hey. Where's the other walkie talkie? There isn't one. What do you want with my daughter? Hey, it's okay. Anna, it's okay, we're done. Turn it off, turn it off. It's not turning... I wanna talk with this man you mentioned. We just mainly a few messages, he doesn't usually answer the phone. Okay, write down his name for me I wanna talk to him myself. And can you give me his book? Thank you. I need to go. Why? You shouldn't be alone. My mom is expecting me home. Wait, Seb, hold on a second. Talk to you later, Katy. Hi, Marie. Something's come up at home I don't think I can make it in tonight. No, I know I left early the other day. My daughter's friend passed away and I needed to be here for her. Yeah, no, I understand. I'll find someone who'll be in. Bye. Hi, Jan. Could you take my shift tonight? No, I understand. Thanks anyways. Mom? Mom. Are you home? Are you working tonight? Yeah. Katy, can you stay with Anna tonight? Or can she go to your place? Is your mom home yet? I'll just stay. I'm sorry, baby, I didn't work last night. I can't lose my job. It's okay. Shit. Fuck. Anna? Mom. What's wrong? Sebastian's dead. What? He drowned. His mom came in and found him in the bathtub. Anna, baby, are you okay? No, I'm not. You stay right there, I'm on my way. I'm so scared, mommy. I love you. Anna? Oh! I should not have left you. It's okay, Mom. It's okay. Katy, are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you for being here. Yeah, well, someone had to be. Pardon me? Nothing. Stay the night. You're not my mother. You're barely home enough to be her fucking mother. Excuse me? Do you know I've been here with her more this month than you have? I was here after Matthew and here I am again after Seb dies. Anna. Anna! Hey. Wake up. Anna, wake up. What are you doing? I contacted the Russian man. The one Seb was talking to. Show me your arm. Why don't we just video him? Okay. So? Any markings? No. No, she's clean. How do we get rid of her? I already told Sebastian there is nothing you can do but wait. No, in your book you mention that there's ways to get rid of her. It hasn't worked. We must try. Come to us or we'll come to you. I have done everything I can. Well, that's bullshit. We have to try. Please. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. No. Come on. I shouldn't of left you with Katy. It wasn't her fault. It was mostly the boys. I know, but if I was around more this never would've happened. Sebastian told me you made a wish. Yeah, was the whole point. Wanna tell me what you wished for? No. Why not? 'Cause then it won't come true. You can tell me. I wished for you. For me? To have you back. You've just been so busy since dad left, so... I'm really trying. Why did he leave? I don't know, I think he just stopped fighting for us. Well, I'm gonna guess someone in this town knows where he lives. Hi. How can I help you? Yeah, I was just wondering if by any chance you know where this man lives. Smirnov? Yeah, yeah, you go down here a couple miles. Take the road off to your left. Watch out for that guy, he's a bit of a wacko. Wait in the car until I know it's safe. What if it isn't? Take this just in case. Hello? Smirnov? Hello? Anna. Smirnov? I thought you were someone else. Are you okay? What did you do? I thought he was hurting you. Is that her? I'm so sorry she tased you. I've had worse. You want tea? That's Lola. What's this? You want to know who she is. The lady in the black dress was first mentioned at the beginning of the 20th century. Due to her black dress the children called her the Queen of Spades. This happened later. 1964 three teenagers died in this summer camp. The surviving children tell the authorities that they encountered a ghost in the mirror when they recited an incantation. Then the months, one by one, they reported a cut in their arms by a ghost. And then they all died. 1984, two 15-year-old girls commit suicide. A letter explains that it's to save her family and themselves from the lady in the mirror. Uh, 1988, a boy jumps from a building crane after telling his parents that a woman in his mirror was trying to kill him. These stories, they go on and on. But that's what they are. Stories. Even crazy stories can be true. Coincidence. There has to be an explanation. It's right in front of you. This is crazy. She's not the only one, there are stories like this all around the world. Why are you collecting these? Why do you know so much? These kids, they're not just another headline. Why are you here? Because I'm trying to save my daughter. You have to help us. There's nothing I can do to save you now. I'm sorry! Anna, Anna! Are you okay? I cannot escape this. We must go. Anna? What's the matter? What's happening? Anna. - Hold her. - What's happening? Hold her. Calm down. She needs to rest. Come here. This ring is cursed. The demon is using it to cling to Anna. Now, canaries can sense the smallest vibrations. She only understands Russian. Any reflective surfaces makes her stronger. Photos, light quantum reflected in the mirror makes her more powerful. Especially new ones like this one made of aluminum instead of silver. What are you doing? Silver highlights on on film, this film, capture more of the electromagnetic spectrum. Digital cameras can't see them as well. What does all this mean? There are more things in this world than we can see. Don't! Don't cover it. Let her come out. Yes, good. Anna. She's here. Where? Help her! Look at me. Cover the mirror now! Oh! Who the fuck are you? Excuse me. Anna? Anna? How do you know so much about all of this? My son told me about the Queen of Spades. He said she came out of the mirror. I didn't believe him. I thought he's just making this up to get attentiOn. I was busy at work, I was a GP at the local hospital back then. He started behaving erratically. He would throw fits and cut himself. I took him to a behavior specialist, they diagnosed him with schizophrenia. And by the time I knew they were wrong it was too late. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine. No, I guess I'm beginning to understand. There she is. That can't be. I need to make it stop. I want it to stop. Now do it exactly like I did it the last time and let her come out to you. You need to return the ring. How? There is not a specific way. You'll know when it feels right. The ring is a symbol. You should set your minds free from the Queen of Spades. Send back the fear she imposes on you. Do it exactly like the last time. Ready? Say it. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Go on. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Now what? Wait. Did we do it wrong? I see her. The bird would have sensed her. She's coming. The bird would go crazy if she were here. Shit. Anna. Anna. No, not yet! Anna. They have to do it themselves. Help them for Christ's sake. No. Anna! Anna, can you hear me? Give her back the ring. Anna, the ring! Come on, baby. Anna, baby. Thank you. You really think she'll be okay? She should be fine. The ring is gone. All this from saying words? Words. Words have power. Not individually, but some words shouldn't be said in front of a mirror. Something just doesn't feel right. Take a deep breath. How do you feel? She's gone. Are you sure? I'll be right back. I'm going to help Mr. Smirnov load this stuff into the car. Thank you. Bye. Come on. What? How can you stare into that thing? It's fine now, see? How's your arm? Uh, it's getting better I think. I hope your mom comes home and cooks us something because this breakfast I made tastes like shit. It's not that bad. It's pretty bad. Anna? Anna, are you okay? Look at me. You're right. It does taste like shit. I'm gonna use the bathroom. Fine. You really think it's over? Yes. For you. You're lucky. You okay? Anna, it's not funny anymore. Stop it. No! Please, Anna! No, please! Please. I can't thank you enough. Katy? Mary. Please help. Help. Anna, please. Anna, please don't do this. Anna! Anna! Anna? Anna. Hold her down! Anna! Don't let him hurt me! We need to call an ambulance! No! No hospital! We have no time! No, Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama. Please, mommy, please, mommy. Don't let him hurt me! We need to do something! Put the needle in her! What is it? It's a sedative! Put it in her arm! I can't. Hold her! Give it to me! Mama! No! No. - I'm calling an ambulance. - No! We need to get her to a hospital. Don't mistake her symptoms for an epileptic seizure. You don't know that. You have to trust me. But... - Listen! - What? There's no medical procedure for demonic possession. She'll go there and they'll prod her and they give her drugs and commit her to an asylum and she will die. - But- - Do you trust me? Do you trust me? Do you trust me! Okay. I trust you. But just save my daughter. Yes. Just save my daughter. I will try. We will try. Put the cat in the cage beside her, all right? I need your help. You think that man will help you? Anna? Couldn't take care of daddy, you couldn't even take care of me. The only reason she's inside of me is because of you left me all alone. Anna, please stop. Untie me and tell that asshole to leave. He's trying to help us. He's trying to hurt me. He's an asshole who let his own son die. What can he do for you? Anna, you have to fight her. I know you're in there. We'll have to put her under. Come and try! He's lying to you! There's no such thing as the lady in the mirror. I made it all up. Stop! We don't have time for this. What are you gonna do? He wants to kill me. We can't debate this any longer. If you want to save your daughter it must be now. Anna? Anna, baby. - Anna, it's okay. - Don't talk to her! It's not her. Mama, save me, please. Mom. He's hurting me. I'll inject her with a lethal dosage of sodium pentathol. It will result in cardiac arrest and clinical death. What? Kill her? Are you fucking crazy? He's lying to you, Mom! He's lying! No, you can't do this. If I don't do it you will lose your daughter. While she's dead the Queen of Spades has to come out of Anna. Then I will revive her. He wants to kill me, Mom. No. It's our only chance! It's crazy, there has to be another way. My son had the same thing. - And he's dead! - She killed him because I was too late! Because I waited too long! But I will not let that happen this time! We must do this! Now! Don't trust him. No. You know in your heart that I'm right. You said you trusted me. I'm only here to save your daughter! Mom, please. No. It's me, Mom, it's me. Please, Mom. You have to make the choice. Do it. No, Mom! No! Mom! Mom, it's me! You can't! - Mom! - We have to do this now. The Queen of Spades, she will latch on to the first soul that she can find. This cat. We need to move back. How do you know she won't get into one of us? I don't know! No, Mom! After 60 seconds I will perform CPR. The cat will look like it's disturbed, but under no circumstances will you let it out. After three minutes I can no longer revive her. And then what? She'll be dead. Anna, Anna. I love you so much, it's gonna be okay. Three, two, one! You'll regret this! Move back! Why! You did this! You let him kill me, Mom! - No. - I trusted you! That's it. Cardiac arrest. Is it supposed to work this way? I don't know. No, it's not working. Revive her! It's too early. How do you know she's gonna get into this cat? She has to. If she doesn't she will lose her connection to our world. 30 seconds! Come on, come on, come on! Do something, we have to do something, it's not working. Keep fighting her! Keep fighting her! Come on, bitch, take me. I'm here. No! Take me, take me! You have to save her now, she's in my head. I can't trust myself not to kill her. Get her away from me. Get her away from me! Come on. Come on. Anna. Charging. Come on, baby, please. Press flashing. - Shock delivered. - Anna, please. - Come on, please. - Charging. Anna, come on. Come on, baby. Come on, come on. Press flashing, shock delivered. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Anna ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Blow out the candles, Anna. Is everything okay, honey?
