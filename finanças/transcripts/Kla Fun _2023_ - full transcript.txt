Bank, how's it going? Cabbages all loaded up, bro. Great. Show time for the Cabbage Racing Crew. Sure thing! SIR, YES, SIR SELF-MADE TEENS LONELY MOUNTAIN-BOY It's the cabbage guy again! Sua, I need help! Bank! Shit! You fuckers deserve this. Bank! Who did this to you?! Bank! X-TREME RIDERS Let's rock it up, X-Treme Riders! Welcome to the X-Treme Riders Show! Let's meet our daredevil racers! First off, Jazz, the Three-Wheel Thunder! Eat my dust, asshole! Next up, Jeans, the Green Inferno! Third is Nay, the Blazing Demon. And our last rider... Kla, the Brave Speedster! Today's just a dress rehearsal. The real race is next week! Blood, sweat, tears, the whole shebang! Whoa, Boss Krit is here! He wants to have some fun too! Let's give him a big hand! Jazz, watch out! You watch out! I'm cruising, man! SUA Boss. Bank is dead. They took our stuff. Give me some time to sniff them out and I'll get back to you. Jeans! What's wrong? Boss looks really pissed. The fuck I know. What happened? If Sua shows up, tell him I've gone to Pattaya. Yes, Boss. What's going on? Sua and Bank haven't come back yet? It's obvious they haven't. What a dumb question. - Cat got your brain, huh? - Shut up. Fuck you. Krit. You took care of the shipping from the North to Pattaya. How come the lot was snatched from us? I used the Cabbage Racing Crew like every time. Ken. Krit did everything by the book. What went down was totally unexpected. And what exactly went down, huh? I'm not gonna lose my money for nothing. Give me some time. I'll sniff it out. Don't forget, man. My money and Krit's money was in that lot too. Jo, you and Krit have to find out who robbed us. Fuck it. FUN Kla... Where are you? At the camp. Mom's not doing well. What do you want me to do? You... You should come home. It's been years since you last came home. I'd rather not. Kla, it's been five years since it happened. Let it go. How is it at the gym? It's pretty slow. So, will you come home to see Mom? Sis, you know she doesn't want to see me. She doesn't mean what she says, you know that. If you come and visit her, things will cool down. Nah. I'd rather she lived in peace. Kan said you were going back to boxing? Probably. I need to make more money. With Mom... She's going to need a lot more money. I'll see what I can do. I gotta go. Listen, come back to see Mom when you can. Take care of her for me. Fun! Your time is not good. If your fitness level doesn't improve... Fun, wait up! Why don't you go home to your mom? No. Things aren't going well, can your sister take care of the gym? If I were in her shoes, I'd have closed it down already. Fun will never do that. The gym is our father's dream project. Your father's dream? What about our dream? Seriously, Kla... I wouldn't have kept that gym going. Everyone has their own dream. We can't live to fulfill other people's dreams. Jab! Good! Jab! Strike! Now kick! Punch! Thanks, Dad. You did good. Dad, what did you give him? Can I have it too? Fun... Are you going back into the ring? Mom, our expenses are going through the roof. Yesterday, the boy who's training with us came to borrow cash for his kid's tuition fees. You should just sell the gym. Don't do it for my sake. Do it for yours. You know I'm not going to be around much longer. Dad, what did you give him? Can I have it too? It belongs to boys. Not girls. Fun... Mom... I'll do everything to make sure that you and the gym will be with me forever. Are you good enough to take up this challenge? Beat the MMA female champion, "Yuna," and get a million-baht prize. A fight that will change your life. Apply now! Jo, do you think Krit is behind the robbery? I swear on my own head that he has nothing to do with it. But only a few people knew about the delivery. Maybe it's Tua Lee's gang. Impossible. We're their main customer, they can't be that dumb. But I've known Krit for a long time. He's not the kind of boss who would kill his own men. But money can always change a man, you know that. Well, what's your plan now? Next month I'll match up Yuna in a fight with a million-baht cash prize. The match will happen in Pattaya. I'm looking for a suitable fighter. Your job is to make sure a lot of VIPs turn up. Leave that to me. But Ken, I asked you about the drugs. Not about the fight. They're the same thing. The entire Pattaya precinct will be busy guarding the VIPs, and we'll ship our big lots out that same day. Kla, Boss wants to see you. Sorry I slept in. It's really late. Come on, he's waiting. Where's Bank? What? I have bad news. What is it? Shit! You fuckers deserve this. Listen... We'll deal with this later. Bank's blood will be avenged with blood. Now go. Go and do your job the best you can. I'll fuck them up real good! Welcome all X-Treme Riders. Itâ€™s time to rock it up! Where the fuck is Kla? He'll come. Relax. Let's roll. Jazz, are you kidding? Talent is one thing. Superstition is another. Got it? Kla's got guts, like his name. He's as good as Bank. His drifting is ace. He can definitely take Bank's place. Sua, get the team ready. We have a major gig waiting. Kick! One, two, three, four... Six, seven, eight. Good! Fun, sure you want to do it? Kan. You were a Jujitsu fighter. Teach me. No time for that. You'd better back out of the fight. It's dangerous. From the EKG result, your mother's heart condition has not improved. Now we can only hope to receive a donor's heart. But it's complicated. The new heart must be compatible with your mother. Another option is the artificial heart transplant. But it'll cost a fortune. You'd better back out. It's dangerous. Who are you to tell me what to do?! If you don't want to teach me, then don't. You don't understand how much this fight means to me. Fun. If you think I don't understand you, then no one in the whole damn world does. I won't teach you and I don't want you to fight because I'm worried about you. Yuna is the MMA champion. She's not the same Muay Thai boxer you once defeated. I'm sorry. My mom is really sick. I'm in a tight corner. You have to teach me MMA. I have to... I have to win this match. Get it? - What? - I've never seen you pray so seriously. Not since we've been together. I prayed for my mother. The doctor said... Don't say it. Bad omen. If you're worried, go back to see her. There's nothing to be afraid of. Dad! San! Honey! Since that night, nothing is the same. Fun had to take up boxing and run our gym. Mom has never talked to me since. You can't fix the past. What happened happened. Nothing you can do about it. Now you should learn to live with it. Well, no one understands me. Someone does. You? Yourself. Hold on to yourself. Believe in yourself. And chase your dreams. Hey, thanks. For what? For everything. Sure. You'll be late for the run-through. MOM Any leads on who killed Bank? Nothing. No news whatsoever. Same here. What about Ken? Excuse me for a moment. - What we got? - Nothing yet. Nothing, nothing out of place. I don't know. - What about Krit? - He got no movement. He likes to spend time over at the fort with his stunt team. Looks like they're rehearsing for a new show. And did Mayor Jo find anything? He's using his connections to dig up leads. So far Jo looks clean. Keep an eye on them both. Tomorrow, there will be a press conference in Pattaya. CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'LL FIGHT YUNA AT THE MMA CHAMPIONSHIP 2022 I've been accepted! Sua, you come with me. Yes, Boss. Ladies and gentlemen, and members of the press. Welcome to the contract signing ceremony for the MMA Championship 2022 Now let's meet our headline fighters, Funkla Sor Sanchai! The press are looking forward to seeing you. But look, the person who's really dying to see you is over there. And our champion from Japan, Takai Yuna! May I invite President Ken Packers to bear witness to the signing of the contract of this highly anticipated rematch between the MMA champion Takai Yuna and two-time Muay Thai champion Funkla Sor Sanchai! MUANFUN SANCHAI That's enough, please. Sorry, we have to go. Punch! One-two! Kick! One-two! Good! Harder! Good! Go! Good! Hit it, slowly. Again. See? Be smart. Now grab my neck. This is Yuna's killer move. Watch out for it. Kla! Finally! How did you find me? Kan told you. Where is he now? He's waiting at the seafood place. This is Pat. - Hi, Fun. - Hi. Let's go join him. Or he'll whine. Give it to your girlfriend. She can take care of herself. Yeah, I'll let you eat all the crabs. Oh, thanks. - This one is the best. - What? INCOMING CALL - THAILAND Try this. Eat some more. Hello? Yes. - What's that? - Don't know. Yes, Mayor Jo. What? Come again? What's wrong? Nothing. Eat some more. SOR SANCHAI BOXING GYM Kla, come in. It's okay. You're home so late today. Mom. Mom. Hey, Krit. What's up, Ken? Have a seat. Let's talk business before we get drunk. Ken, I'll deliver this lot myself. And you, focus on finding that missing lot. Suit yourself. But I'm sending my guys along as well. - What's up? - Hi. How are you? - Fine? - Fine. I just paid it off. Oh. Good stuff. Yeah. JO'S GUY You're cool with it, Krit? Sure. Whatever you say. Excuse me, bring him a whisky soda. - You know what I like. - Of course, I do. You're my best friend. Cheers. You guys have to pull this one off. It's our chance for revenge. This time, Jo will do the swap at the port. I already made sure the coast is clear. Do not fail. - Yes, Boss. - Take care of it for me, Sak. After making the swap at Point A, Nay and I will snatch the drugs. The drugs are stuffed in the sandbags. Put them all in a container and ship it out on the day of Yuna's fight. The money must be in Sak's car. He's Jo's right hand. Jeans, Jazz and Kla, you three work as a team. Finish your job at Point B. Be fucking focused, everyone. Boss just gave us a brand new car. I won't disappoint him. After it's done, we'll split up and go our separate ways. Go! Fun, remember Yuna is no longer the same fighter who lost to you. She will go for Take Down and Submission. So, keep her at bay. Don't get too close. Or she'll throw you down. Stand firm on your feet and you'll beat her. Shit. This is made just for me. Die! June, kill them all! I'm here. Where are you? This way. Follow me. - How's she doing? - She already woke up. Since she opened her eyes, she keeps asking for you. Mom. Mom. It's me. I'm here. Kla. I'm right here. I'm sorry, Mom. I love you. Forget about getting a donor's heart. It's impossible. All we can do is wait. Mom might die before she gets it. Getting an artificial heart is the best way to save her life. Don't worry about it. I'll get paid a huge sum from this fight. Yes, Mayor. I'll cut to the chase. Do me a favor. Lose the match. Come again? You heard me. Lose the match. Don't worry. I'll double the prize money for you. Okay? Take it. It's yours. Go on, take it. Today, give it all you've got. That's all I'm asking of you. This money is for your mother's treatment. Thank you, Boss. I really appreciate it. Pat. Kla. I'm going to Pattaya with Boss. For what? For business. What business? - And the money? - Boss gave it to me. - For my mom's treatment. - No way! It's still not enough. But it's good enough. Fun will win the fight and get the prize money. Then you'll have more than enough. Hold it. One, two, three. Give the money to Fun. Sure, I'll go see her at the gym and you'll come meet us there. What is it? I love you. I love you back. Fun, just relax. You can do it. BOSS JUST GAVE ME SOME MONEY Guys, into position. Sua, the trailer is on the way to Point A. Right on time! Nice to see you again. So, what are we waiting for? What the fuck is he saying? Where is my merchandise? Show me the money. Gosh. All there. Hold on. - Open the container. - Go check. Hey, never fail to impress, huh? No doubt about it. When will the container be loaded up for the ship? The boat is already here. All this will be exported today. It's done, Boss. Yes. Yeah! Okay, good. Let's go. Yeah, we're done here. Right, you're done here. Ready. You go, Sua. Mission one accomplished. Kla, are you ready? Do you copy? Hey, Sua's asking you. Answer him. I'm good to go. Let's go. Stay focused, remember? I know you're worried about your mother. But look at me. First time doing this and I'm so goddamn chill. - Are you? - Yeah. - Stay focused. - Fuck you. Sure I am. Target is moving to Point B. Get ready. - Let's do this, dudes. - For Bank. Hold on for dear life. Sak, we got a tail. Who the fuck are they? Stick it to them! Go to hell, you fuckers! Come on! Come and get me. Die, you scum. You deserve it. Get the money. We avenged Bank. I'm loving it! We're not done. Let's go wrap it up. Yes, sir.

Now go take care of your mother. Thank you so much. Without you, I wouldn't have had this chance. - Let's go! - Go, go! Hey. Nay, Jeans, Jazz, look after Boss. - I'll go up there. - Sure. I'll cover this area. You go up there. Be careful. - Damn, I need to go fucking back there? - Just go. WHERE ARE YOU? THE FIGHT IS ABOUT TO START - KAN You know the rules. Protect yourself at all times and listen to my command. Touch gloves if you want. Back to your corner. Ready. Fight! Stop. Fight! Stop. Fun, don't trade blows with her.

So don't worry about anything. Give it all you've got. Fight! If you want to be a boxer, you have to love what you're doing. You have to believe that you're a fighter. - Come on. - Hey. - Shithead. - What the fuck? Go to hell, bitch! It's you, Jo? You piece of shit! Yes, it's me! I'm killing you both, motherfuckers! Fuck!

For real? - Matches your face. - Stupid. Come here. Kla! Kla! What's his name? Kla Sanchai. Is he related to the patient called Pin Sanchai? Mom. Kla is gone. But his heart will stay with you forever. Clear! Prepare an OR, immediately. Krit, I... I need to thank you for having my back. Who would have thought a friend could do that to a friend? As for the cargo and the cash, you really don't know anything?
