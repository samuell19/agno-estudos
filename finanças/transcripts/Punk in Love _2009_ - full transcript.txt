If you kill yourself, I won't clean your grave! What are you talking about? Sorry, sir. Hey, Rok! If you have the guts to kill yourself, why don't you have the guts to tell Maia that you love her? Maia loves you! Don't you get it? - Yes, Rok! - Yes, Rok! Ready? One. Get down! Two. Three! Wait, sir. Why did he jump? Sir, help me! What? Help? Help me! Hey, help! Help! Hold on, sir!

BRIDGE, HEIGHT: 50 M You're lucky you helped them, Rok. Otherwise, they'll throw you in jail. What were you thinking, trying to kill yourself? I was lost, Jo. When I received Maia's wedding invitation, I felt lost. I feel broken. Al, are you sure that Maia is in love with me? Did she tell you? No, she didn't. But I could tell from the way she looked, talked, - and paid attention to you. - It's your fault for being blind! That's why you should confess to Maia so that you know the truth. Come on, Rok. You have to be brave enough to talk to Maia! Once means it is already dead - Stop talking nonsense. - Shut up. Seriously. I'm going to Jakarta! Come with me. - Okay! - Okay! Come on. You're not saying goodbye first? I'm too lazy to meet my mom. I can't even do that. I have to say goodbye. My mom is alone. You're such a mama's boy. So what? She's my mom. Hey. Mom, I'm leaving to go to Jakarta. I want to go with Arok to pursue his love. Yes, ma'am. Please pray for me, ma'am, so that I can meet Maia. Please pray for us, ma'am. For us to arrive safely in Jakarta. Yes, I'll pray for you. I hope everyone is safe in Jakarta. Then Arok can unite with Maia. Pursue your love even to China. - Amen. - Amen. Goodbye, Mom. Pray for me, ma'am. We're leaving, ma'am. - Be careful. - Well then, ma'am. Jo! Mojo! - What, Mom? - Where are you going? Bury them first! Hey, hurry up! People have been waiting. Yes, Mom. Hey, Jo! Hey! Help me so we can finish faster! - Come on. - Let's go. Cigarettes are expensive. Yes. Here's the change, 3,000 rupiah. It's 27,000 rupiah. - What now? - Let's ride the train. - Yes. - Let's go. We just want to cross over. We want to go across. It's too far away otherwise. Crossing... Sir... Okay, we're leaving. Jerk. Excuse me, sirs, is anyone heading to Jakarta? I'm going to Sidoarjo. I stopped at Bromo. I'm going to Yogyakarta. Is Yogyakarta near Jakarta, sir? No, it's far away. But I'm not wrong, right? Yes, to the west. Blood lethargic For what... I want to go to Jakarta, can I come with you? Okay, but only until Yogyakarta. Yes, sir. - Where's the car, sir? - The red one. - That one? - Yes. Okay. Thank you, sir. - You're mean, really mean... - You're mean... What? What is it? It's crazy! The music is so weird. It's tacky and not wild at all. Not rebellious, right? - What? - What? - Gosh! - Come here! - Gosh. - Gosh. Look at her. Sorry, miss. Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. Where's the driver? - Why hasn't he started the car yet? - Relax, Rok. There are still five days left, right? We'll get there for sure. Why did you keep it? Do you even know Maia's address? Yes. What should we bring for Maia? What? A ring? You couldn't even confess to her and you want to bring her a ring? - Yes. - Yes. It's fake, anyway. Leave me be. It's not like you guys are rich. Right! Rok, you have to speak up, not be silent. I know. If Maia accepts my love, I will propose to her immediately. - Yes, right. - Sure. Speed up, sir! Don't worry, sir. Damn it! Hey! Get off! Why are you all hitchhiking? My head hurts! Who told you to get on the truck? Get off! I have permission from the driver! Why are you making a fuss? - Let's go! - Come on! What's wrong with Mojo? Hey! What is this? Stay out of this, sir. It's our business. - Let's go! - Come on! Let's go, Jo! - Come on, Jo! - Beat him up, Jo! Don't you want to go to Yogyakarta? Where is this, sir? Bromo. - What? Damn it! - What? Damn it! Sorry, dude. He told me it was a red car. We did ride in a red car though. - Wrong car. - Wrong car. If we help wash the dishes, could they give us some food? You would break it all. Let me try. You are a troublemaker. I'll do whatever. I'll wash the dishes. I don't need that. You need me. I can sweep. - No. - Wipe the table? - No. - Clean the bathroom? - No. - Cook the eggs? No! Thief! You devil! Stupid! Demon! It's enough, Jo. Calm down, okay? What should we do, Al? If we don't eat, we'll die. He's right. Let's buy a drink, it's so cold. - Okay? - Okay. If you don't eat often enough, you'll die. You're right. If we keep getting lost, Maia will get married. Sorry. My body and heart are hot, but my ass is cold. I think is it the moon that makes us cold? Stupid. What? Al. So your ass doesn't get cold. Thank you, you know my ass is cold. Here, there's food. - It's still delicious. - Here, Jo. - Give it to me. - Here. - Where did you get the box from? - What? That's a lot, Rok. Here. Take it yourself. Al? What? Nothing. Rok, get me one! Get it yourself. There's a lot here! This idiot. Son. Wake up, son. Son. Wake up, son. Wake up. I want to open up the store. - Yes, ma'am. - Jo, wake up. Jo, wake up. Ma'am. This one is dangerous. Let me do it. Rok. Rok, wake up. Rok, wake up. That hurts. I told you it's dangerous. Take that. - Go ahead, ma'am. - Go ahead, ma'am. - Who is she? - The shop owner. Here's the tea. Thank you, ma'am. Let's hitchhike. - Four people! - Let us ride until the next stop! - Where are you going? - Jakarta. - That's so far away. - Where are you going? Blitar. - Can we get a ride? - Yes, come on. - Let's go. - Get in. Come on, let's go. - Shall we go to Jakarta? - Yes. If we get lost, it's not my fault. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Almira. I'm Gustaf. This is my wife. Nina. - What? - Nina. Blitar was Mr. Karno's place, right? Yes. Will they really sell the house? I don't know, it's confusing. How unfortunate. I'm really fond of Mr. Karno. He was smart, dignified and rebellious. He must have been a punk in his youth. - Yes. - Of course. - Yes. - Definitely. Here's Mr. Karno's grave, Jo. - This is it? - It's beautiful. - Thank you, buddy. - Yes. - It's quiet. - Where should we take a picture? - Over there, Rok. - There? Sir. I respect and admire you so much. BUNG KARNO, FIRST PRESIDENT OF INDONESIA Rest in peace, sir. My friends and I will definitely continue your dream. Proclamation! We, the Indonesian people, hereby declare the independence of Indonesia. Matters concerning the transfer of power and others are carried out in a thorough manner and in the shortest possible time. Jakarta, August 17, 1945. -On behalf of the Indonesian nation, -On behalf of the Indonesian nation, - Soekarno and Hatta. - Soekarno and Hatta. GOODBYE This car is comfortable. Old but still soft. I wonder how we are going to be when we're old. Granda Punk is going to be too old. - It's fun, Jo. - You're right. We'll wake up early. We'll play with our grandchildren while smoking weed. Do you still want to get drunk when you're old? I won't do it, but I'm still going to be punk, anti-establishment. What is the meaning of anti-establishment that makes you confused? Yes. How could we be anti-establishment if we never even feel established? - That's right. - Go read a book. It means refusing the rules of society, not money. The theory is that we don't need fixed rules to live our lives, we are free to choose our own rules for our lives. Yes, self-sufficient. What? What kind of self-sufficiency is this? Fulfilling your needs in your own way, get it? Maybe you're smart after all. Good timing. - More. - Yes. - Understand? - Yes. Ready? One... Two... Hey. You're crazy. Sir. The satay. How much for ten skewers? It's 7,000 rupiah with rice cake. - Expensive! - Expensive! Sir, I want 40 skewers with four rice cakes. Al, give him the money. Are you kidding? It's only enough for seven skewers! I can't add rice cakes! Come on, sir, what's a little charity? Go make them. I don't want to use violence. He got a sickle? Come on, son! Let's fight! We'll see whose blood spills first! - Watch out, Rok. - Calm down, Jo, don't panic. Forgive me, sir! Don't kill me, sir! I'm sorry, sir. Don't kill me, sir. My mom is old. Don't kill me, sir. I haven't eaten for five days. It's true, sir, I'm not lying. My stomach hurts. This is the money, sir. Just take it all. Sir... Maia! Forgive me! I don't have time to confess my love for you! You haven't confessed your love yet? Not yet, sir. Don't kill me, sir! - Don't kill me, sir! - Get up. What a hassle. I'll forgive you for love. You'll get 20 skewers and four rice cakes. Just pay 6,000 rupiah! Thank you, sir. - Thank you very much, sir. - Thank you, sir. With one condition! Fan the satay correctly! Jo! Satay-flavored cigarette. It's like seasoning. I found it. Don't take too long. It'll burn. Is it sunset? Here. Tiwi's family disagreed! She's going to be in an arranged marriage with a salt lord. I challenged him to a fight! I was willing to die for Tiwi! But Tiwi... gave herself up to the salt lord so that I could live. My heart is crying. Be patient, sir. Satay! Thank you, sir. Satay! Satay! Satay! Hey! Damn it! Let's go! Don't stay the night here! What will we ride at this hour, Rok? Yes, Rok, get some rest first. You can sleep really easily. I really want to meet Maia! Let's take the bus! Find the cheapest bus. Do you have money? If I pay, let's go to a big city like Semarang. We could find another ride easily there, right? - Yes, come on. - Let's go. I only have 15,000 rupiahs left. I haggled with the driver, so it's 1,500 per person. - Yes. - Yes, Al. I believe in you. Let's go to sleep. I want to dream of Maia. Don't hit me! You're so annoying. What is this smell? What's wrong, Ji? What's wrong? My stomach hurts, Al. It seems because of last night's satay. Gosh. What should I do? I'm screwed. We can find a mosque. Can you hold it? It's hard, Al. It's about to come out. Gosh. - It's about to come! - Damn it, you devil! - Damn! - Try to hold it, Ji. What the hell? Damn! Yoji has to take a dump. It's going to come out soon. - Soon? - What should we do? Don't, Ji. You can't do it here. I have to do it, Rok. Do it through the window. Do it while the other passengers are asleep. You and your stupid mouth! I don't want to do it through the window! What if my ass gets hit by a motorcycle? - Damn you! - It beats shitting in the bus. Your idea is brilliant, Jo. Help him. I don't want to. Hey, come on. Jo, help me. Damn it, Jo, I don't want to crap in my pants! Take off your pants! I'll grab you. You don't have to. Okay, good. - It's about to come out. - To the window. My head! Behind! Slowly, Jo! Please, Jo. Is that it? Go to the right a little. - Jo. - One. - Two. - Damn it, my head! - It has to be right. - It's slipping! Go to the left a little, Rok. My head! Three. - Is that it? - Yes. Hey, why are you squatting on the window? Damn! What the hell is this? Sorry, miss. I can't hold it anymore. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Hey, you! Are you done? Come here and do push-ups! Not yet, sir! Just a little bit more! - Take your shoes and come here! - Shit! Damn it. You shat in a random place. You have no discipline! Why are you stopping? From the top! Do we have to repeat it? One! - Two! - Let's settle, sir! Andra, wake up. Dra! Wake up, it's 10 a.m. already! It's still early, Mai. How is it still early? We have a lot of things to do today! Where are you going? Stop making a fuss. We have to go to the associate, subdistrict office and marriage office! Come on, Dra. Wake up quickly! Let's do it tomorrow! Damn it, he's going back to sleep! Sorry, guys. It was a disaster. We paid and we're still not in Semarang! If I'm late to meet Maia, it's because of your ass! I hope your ass is tearing up! Don't say that, Rok. What? Go away! You smell so bad. Has your ass ever gone to school? I did, but only up to elementary school, Al. Do you think it's funny? You devil. Sorry, guys. I'll look for a ride, okay? I'll look for it now, okay? Wait here. Come here. Come on. Al, Rok, come here! - What? - That. Do you recognize him? Are you serious? Is it him? Shit! Fuck! Calendar model? - That damned homo! - What's going on? Yoji! Homo! Stop it! - Sign something for me. - Fuck off. So arrogant! Teach me how to smile like that. That's so cute! Look at his hands! I wish I could take a photo like you so I could get chosen. Are you picking a fight? - Fuck off! - You were so cute. I want to go home! - I'm holding him. - Where are you going? - I'm holding Yoji. - Teach me, Yoji. Let him be. Let's see the photo again, Jo. Are you satisfied? Are you guys satisfied? Take a pose. Like this. Fuckers! Let it be, Ji. Don't sulk. They're joking. Do you understand why I became a model, Al? Aunt Rossa! I was trapped, Al. Okay. It's over. But they're not mad at you anymore because of that photo. Ji! Come here! Slick down your hair. Son of a bitch. A calendar model with a basketball jersey! Yoji is a punk with a basketball jersey! Teach me, Ji! Yoji! Yoji! Teach me, Ji! I'll admit it though. Your face looks so cute in the photo. So cute. Yes? Fuck off. It's nice, isn't it? This atmosphere is nice with the right person. Like now. Hey! Let's go! Don't talk too long! Sir, let us take a ride with you. - Yes, go ahead. - Thank you, sir. - Fuck! - Damn it! - Fuck! - What is this, Jo? The driver didn't say anything! It's fine, it's better to be hit by flour than not meeting Maia, okay? Are we going to Jakarta? No, Semarang. Are we going to have an election? There are so many flags. It should be for us. We can use it as pants. You're right, Rok. I don't want to wear pants from a party flag. None of them are good. - Don't you want to vote? - Of course not. - It's better if I make my own party. - Yes! - That's right! - Me! I'll choose the name. I'll make Prosperous Tombstone Party. My mom is the chairperson and I'm the secretary-general. The candidate is kuntilanak and genderuwo. - That's right. - Tuyul. I'll make Love To Death Party. There will be no war. If you're going to fight, go play chess. - I'm City Bus Party. - Your face is like a mouse. I'm Development of the Love of Workers' Popular Democratic Unity Party. Conscience is the mandate of the struggle for the welfare of Indonesia. Never break a promise. - Is that a train? - How's the campaign? Our brothers from the PKPDKPHIBKLM Party... Whatever! We will never break promises, just like doves. Ridiculous! Guys. Get off here. The truck is about to enter the factory. I can't bring passengers. - Yes, sir. - Let's go, guys. - Where is this, sir? - Semarang. Finally, Semarang! Semarang! - Semarang! - Semarang! Water? Sir. Can't you take us somewhere else? What kind of thugs are afraid of flood? Get down! I haven't washed in three months, it'll be itchy. - Let's get naked. - Yes. What about me? Where to, Jo? Just go there. It seems the flood is lower there. Are you serious, Jo? I am. I'll beat you up if you're wrong. You're not getting wet up there, don't even comment. It's not like I could get naked like you guys. Why are you shy as a punk? Hey, she'll fall down! Calm down! Just kidding. What is that, Jo? Al! Not me. Wait, Jo, my leg hurts! Don't be like that! Turn around! It's hard, Jo! - So itchy! - Pull him out! Are you okay, Jo? Jo! Let's just go! What should I do? It keeps dropping. Jo, look. Your feet. It's just a little cut. Don't worry about it. Where are the clothes? Damn it, I'm cold and itchy. What's wrong with you? It's me! Your face looks like a demon! Al. Don't come too close. Just throw it. Here's the powder. My hair will go back up. My body is still itchy, Jo. Who is that? - You're so ugly, Al! - That's right! Shut up! Like you guys are better! Your butt is showing. Take off your clothes. Here's the powder. Why are you smiling? You're cute in that dress, Al. What the hell? Something's inside my pants. Really? That was you? What? What is this? - What's wrong? - It's shrinking. You're not sleeping, Al? I'm not sleepy, Ji. - Are you thinking about your mom? - Don't make fun of me. Why would I make fun of you, Al? So what if we remember our moms? It's natural. She's selfish, Ji. She puts me in an arranged marriage with that guy! Maybe your mom is worried seeing you like this, Al. That's why. I have to find someone who can accept me just the way I am. Sorry, Al. You must be cold. Here, use this. Mai. I still love you, Mai. A lot. Arok is dreaming. Yes. Don't move, Mai. Don't move. - What the hell? - Mai. - You devil. - Just a little. Wake up, Jo. Don't be shy, Mai. Just a little. Go away! Damn it, Jo! Why did you hit me? - You groped me! - Liar! What kind of dream was it? Was it porn? Maia or Mojo? You're disgusting! Go hump a tree! Go away! Don't bother me when I'm sleeping! Let us help, sir. That's enough. Thank you. Rok. If God allows and you marry Maia, what do you want? We'll have children and open up a business. What business, Rok? I want to get a driver's license and a small diner. Rok, a driver's license is so punk, but a diner? It's okay. What's important is your own efforts. Yes. If the customers are like us, you'll get loss for we put you in debt. You can put it in your tab, Al. I'll collect it later. Who's going to cook, Rok? Rok! He's sleeping. Monkey. MAIA AROK DINER - Hooray! - It's done. Help! Mai? Maia! Fuck you! Let me go! Let my wife go! It's not her fault! Maia! Maia! Let my wife go! - Arok is dreaming, Ji. - Maia! Is he dreaming, Ji? Maia! Come on, let's go one-on-one if you dare! Ji, Yoji! Rok? That's why you shouldn't be too bold. It's dangerous to wake a sleeping person. The spirit might not return to the body. - Really? - Really? Yes. Fuck you! Come on! Let's fight! Let me go! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, let's fight! Fuck you! Don't! No, don't put it in! Don't put it in! Don't put it in! Don't put it in! Don't! What's wrong, Rok? What's the matter? It's nothing. Were you dreaming of being raped by a man, Rok? - What? - What? Is that right, Rok? - What? No! - That's why you're screaming. "No, sir! Don't put it in!" No! I want to get married. Why would I be raped by a man? - "No, sir!" - "Taste this, Arok!" - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Where's the groom? He couldn't come. I see. Okay, the documents are complete, you just have to do the marriage vow. Hey. Let's go. Let's go. Don't you want to go to Jakarta? Come on, guys. Here we go. We're going to Cirebon. HEARSE - It's empty. - Please. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Why would we ride on a hearse? We won't get lost, but we'll get haunted. You're crazy, Jo. This is for dead people! If you jumped before, you'll be driven in a car like this, Rok. Do you want to meet Maia or not? Yes, I want to, but... Shall we go? Yes, sir. Well? Al? Fine, Al and I are going to go. I'll send your regards to Maia, Rok. - You first. - I don't want to! - Wait, Jo! - Hey! Jo! - Jo! - Jo! Don't sleep there! You'll get possessed! We will all be ghosts, anyway. When I was a baby, when my mom worked, she often put me to sleep in this. The entire family is crazy. Crazy! I miss my mom so much. How are you doing, Mom? Mama's boy. Are you going to Jakarta or not? What? Get in! - Get in! - I'm scared, Rok. Get in. I'll go after you. Fuck you, Rok. - Just a moment. - Yes, sir. BUNGA KASIH FOUNDATION Look, durian! Gosh, hey, damn. Monthong or petruk? Maybe bagong? I haven't eaten durian in a long time. Jo, we haven't eaten in a long time. You're right. It must be delicious to eat durian when you're hungry. We can get high at the same time. They're going to offer some to us, right? Of course. Petruk, come here. Sir. We'll continue now. Sir. Hey, turn it off! Fuck! Damn it! God is so unfair! Why would you bring God into this? Come on, Jo! We're hungry and they don't even feed us! Now they're playing a shitty song! Fuck! You're right, Rok. I don't believe in God. - Hey. - We're already poor, yet we're always in a hard situation. Yes! If God exists, why there isn't a hot mud flood in Jakarta? They're the ones opening the mines! God exists, it's just that you guys don't feel His presence. We're just here for a while. Real life begins after we're dead. You should be grateful to be given long lives to be punks. What is there to be grateful for if it's like this, Jo? What's wrong? - Fuck! - The driver is sleepy. - What? - Sir! - Sir! - Sir, wake up! - Sir, wake up! - Sir! - Wake him up, Ji! - Sir, wake up! Be careful, sir! We could die! Damn it! - Sir! - Sir! - Sir, what are you doing? - Sir! Sir! Damn it! Wake up, sir! God... If You are going to take me now, I entrust my mom to you, God. Amen. - Dear God! - My God! - My goodness! - My goodness! Prove it to me, God! Dear God! Praise be God! Thank God. - We're back again. - What's wrong? My goodness! Sir! Wake up, sir! I bear witness that there is no deity but God, - and Muhammad is the messenger of God. - Sir! Dear God! I'm going to busk, I'm hungry. I'll come, Al. Damn it. Hey. Why are you being lazy? Let's busk! Why are you limping, Jo? Yesterday's wound. It hurts a little. Excuse me. -We don't care about what they give -About what they give - We need money first! Yes! - We need money first! Yes! Heavy metal! - It's normal. - Just normal. It's just normal What? That's it? - Gosh. - Gosh. What should we do? Al. You can dance, right? - What do you mean? - Help me out. Come on.

The money will run out! Can't you think? Just buy two pieces. There is no need for a pack. What are you saying? Do you think I could buy it in pieces like a cigarette? It's okay, Rok, the money won't run out. But what should I do? Try to buy it in pieces. Let's go. - Thank you. - Yes. - Sir, two pads, please. - Yes. - The cheapest one, sir. - Yes.
