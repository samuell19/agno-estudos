[AIRCRAFT SWOOSHING] MAN: It keeps nudging down, Falcon 7. Slide below. Keep them bracketed. MAN 2: Will do, sir. PILOT: [IN A FOREIGN ACCENT] Here, ease it down. I request permission to land. MAN 1: You'll get it. Just keep your pattern. PILOT: I must land. I am low in fuel. PILOT: I must land. We know that. Hang on, Captain. MAN: They just keep circling, sir. Because they are not authorized to land. High level contact with the American Secret Service indicate news of dramatic development in the hijacking crisis. No further word from Egypt since official announcements that the hijackers have been allowed to leave that country. Destination unknown. In spite of official denials, informed sources at the White House confirmed a US Military operation has been launched. Have you any clue what the Italians are up to, General? I have no idea why they won't let us land, Colonel. They closed the airport! Any alternatives? The Egyptian carrier is low on fuel. Negative. We have our orders. Sooner or later, they'll let us land. PILOT: I sure hope, so. What is the situation? PRESIDENT: Get me Prime Minister Craxi in Rome, please. LADY: Yes, sir. [PHONE RINGING] MAN: Hotel Raphael. PRESIDENT: Mr. Craxi's suite, please. MAN: The Prime Minister is sleeping at this hour. Who's calling? PRESIDENT: The President of the United States. Please tell him it's quite urgent. [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS] [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, Mr. President. I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour, Mr. Prime Minister. But it is a matter of vital importance. I have to inform you, we have a standoff situation at Sigonella. I understand you perfectly. What can I do for you, Mr. President? I'm asking you, as head of the Italian government, to authorize the Egyptian aircraft to land at Sigonella NATO base, together with the American aircraft, now escorting it. Are you sure of the identity of those aboard the Egyptian aircraft? Beyond the shadow of a doubt. In that case, we are pleased to cooperate, Mr. President. I'll permit them to land. Falcon 7, we have a, go force them down, now. I copy, sir. We'll get them down. Hang on. PILOT: US Commander to Egypt air carrier. Start you approach, Captain. You have a four minute touch down. It seems that the Italians are going to let us land. Falcon 7 here, to operations. Egyptian Civil aircraft is touching down now. We'll keep patrolling the air space. She's all yours, General. Affirmative, Falcon 7. Well, gentlemen, we have done it. Let's go down there and get them. We're gonna take these bandits home with us. [WHIRRING] KHALEED: Get down! Get down everybody. [FAINT SIRENS BLARING] MAN: Nobody is to embark or disembark without my orders. [SHOUTING ORDERS IN ITALIAN] [SIRENS BLARING] [AIRCRAFT SWOOSHING] Look, look, Americans. Bridge down. At me. At me. GENERAL: Follow that aircraft. Move it. Move it. [FOOTSTEPS SOUNDING] MAN: All right. Let's go. Move it. Move it. MAN: Move it. Move it. This way. Colonel Annicchiarico. Commander of this base. I request that you withdraw your men, and order them back on the plane. Colonel. General Davies, I have orders to take custody of the terrorists aboard this aircraft. Whose orders may I ask? The government of the United States of America. We are not in America here. This is a NATO Base. Which I have the honor of commanding, and which is on Italian soil. Are you saying you'd order your men to prevent the capture of these terrorists? Using any means necessary? I will do whatever I consider my duty to ensure the international law, and Italian jurisdiction are upheld. [WHIRRING] Looks pretty hot down there, what do you think? We're a lot better off up here, sir. Get me Washington. I'm on the runway at Sigonella. The commander of the base refuses to hand over the hijackers. He says the Italians have jurisdiction over the Achille Lauro terrorists. GENERAL: Do we wanna use force? What do we do, Mr. President? Call Rome. I want to speak to Prime Minister Craxi. Mr. President, some of the passengers are leaving Egypt now. General Davies, passengers from the ship should be there in approximately three hours, to identify the terrorists. [PHONE RINGING] Keep your men where they are. Yes, sir. Mr. Craxi, sir. PRESIDENT: Mr. Craxi, I need your hep again. Hold on. [MAN SHOUTING ORDERS] COLONEL: [GIVING ORDERS IN ITALIAN] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAIN CHUGGING] MAN: Slow down. Wait. Salaam alaikum. No, he will carry the case with all the weapons. I am here to set things in motion. I do not participate. Once we are aboard, you do not know me and only Molqi may contact me. All right, you three, you may start boarding now. You're certain they do not suspect our real plans? They believe they are going to die in Israel. Good. See you. MAN: Jincia! What are you doing? I'm so sorry, excuse me. I'm so sorry. Come on, Jincia. Excuse me. Luciano, where are you going? Luciano, my ticket. MAN: Hey, giovanotto, young man, MAN: Young man! Your suitcase. MAN: You have to check it in over there. MAN: It will be delivered to your cabin. Grazie. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me. Ah, mon Dieu. Crowds, smells... Let's hope at least our cabin is clean. Please darling, you promised to relax and enjoy the cruise. We need it, Pierre. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: You're American? Yes. Alone? Sorry my friend, you are too late. Oh, honeymoon. Yes. No. He's a perfect stranger. But a charming liar. You see? You're too late. If you don't mind. Hi, I'm Cheryl. Michele. I'm Helmut. Your passport, please. CHERYL: Thank you. MAN: Your passports, please. MAN: Gentlemen, your passports, please. [PHONE RINGING] Salaam Alaikum. This is Petros here from Genoa. PETROS: All is well. The goods have been delivered. And we will leave on time, Inshallah. MAN: Excellent. Will there be any problem when your partners discover that the goods are not being delivered where they thought? PETROS: Everything has been dealt with. I have verified it myself. I don't need to tell how important the success of this deal is for all of us. Good luck. And to you too. MAN: Heads up, heads up, coming through. MAN: Thank you, thank you. MAN: Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, watch it, watch it, watch it. Thank you, thank you. MAN: Faster, faster. [LAUGHTER] Oh, I know I'm in Italy. I'm being kidnapped. What's your name, son? Antonio. Antonio, huh? Antonio, you drive too damn fast. You have no respect for &quot;Stop&quot; signs, and you go right through red lights. You're like all Italians. But, you're one helluva driver. Thank you, sir. Antonio? Si, Signora? My husband seems to like you, and I promise you that doesn't happen very often. So I would appreciate it if you would help me look after him on the ship. I mean, it's too much for me, all those ramps up and down. Anyway, he likes the open air, and... I can't stand the sun. Fine for me, Signora. If it's okay for... You be my personal Ferrari. Okay, thank you, sir. If you need help, please call. What's all this crap about not liking the sun, huh? You know something that the doctors haven't told me? [WATER RUNNING] Leon, I can't hear you. I said, &quot;Do you know something that the doctors haven't told me?&quot; [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Here we are. One, two, three, four... All these are the clerks? Si. Okay, here's your key. Thank you. Buongiorno. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] Check your weapons, Why? Do as I say. [SHIP HORN HOOTING] [TRUMPET PLAYING] [WOMAN SINGING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Hi, Cheryl. Oh, one minute. So, who won? BOTH: Me. We tied. We cheated. Of course. But we are not finished, yet. Ah! Yeah. I have to get back to work. Okay. I'll see you later. Yeah, at the bar. Bye. Bye. Okay. Let's take it from... the second verse. Right. Okay? [SOFT, MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] * Could heaven mean * This harm on me * These two hearts Beating as one * This true love We have begun * Forever and eternally * Sounds heavenly In love to me * Could heaven... What's a nice... May I have the pleasure to dance with your wife? Marilyn, you won first prize. I have a telegram. Just came from Israel. Some old friends of mine. I'd like to read it to you. Before Marilyn gets back. Here we are. &quot;There was a young lady named Gloria, who went down on the Andrea Doria...&quot; Leon, we got ladies present. You've heard it before. I know. But you haven't heard this one. To a wonderful trip. ALL: Aww! [RAISING A TOAST IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Nice people, those Americans. American Jews. What difference does that make? Obviously none to you. [LOUD LAUGHTER] So, you're from New York City? Yes, the East Village. Do you know it? Oh, yes. In fact, you could say, I'm part American, too. Most of my bothers and sisters were born in the United States. Oh. LADY: Jincia! Can I dance, too? Mommy, please? No, signorina. You are going straight to your bed. Now, Grandma will tuck you in. Now be a good girl. See you in the morning. But not too early. [APPLAUSE] Hello. Hi. Wanna dance? Okay. No. Something wrong? [SPEAKS ITALIAN] I'm a... What? Sea sickness. I'm fine. [JOVIAL MUSIC PLAYING] Let's dance. No. Show us what you can do. All right. You asked for it. Go on. Dance. Go on. I'm going. Oh, come on, dance. Try to enjoy yourself. How can you enjoy this? Everybody else is doing it. But not me. Forget it. I need some air. Have fun. Good evening, Captain. Good evening. What's this? A komboloi. A Greek rosary. To wish you a pleasant journey. If I am not mistaken, we've seen you on the Lauro before, Mr... Petros. Floros Petros. You have a good memory, Captain De Rosa. Good night. Good night. [JOVIAL MUSIC CONTINUES] [SOFT, POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING] Where the hell am I? Ah! It's a beautiful sunny day. What a great way to start a cruise, Leon. My father used to say, &quot;If you wanna sleep in peace marry a woman with low blood pressure.&quot; [LAUGHS] Come on. Rise and shine. Get moving. You can sleep at home for free. In here, you're paying for every minute. Now, come on. Get moving. There's a whole new world out there, Leon. Now. Agh! Some days I think this is all a bad dream. I'll wake up one morning. Call for the dog. Go running in the park. Come on, Leon. Come on. Come on, pull. Come on. Where do you think you're going, young lady? Come here. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Oh! Mmm. [GUN SHOTS] Pull. [GUN SHOT] Pull. [GUN SHOT] [PIERRE SPEAKS FRENCH] MAN: Yeah, not bad. Not bad. Pull. [GUN SHOT] Pull. Ah! [APPLAUSE] Did you see that? Yeah, we showed them. [LAUGHTER] Your turn, Stead. Let's get out of here. We two haven't finished yet. Ah, but I have to leave. Hey, Leon, where're you going? You want us to lose the war? Oh, dear. [SIGHS] You're tired, sir? Is that why you stop? No, no. Just quit while you are ahead. I might make another double like that, if I live to be a thousand. You're only joking, sir. You're a wonderful shooter. Wonderful shot? You should've seen me during the war. You ever heard of Pearl Harbor. You were there, sir? Well, just move over and I'll show you what I did. I was the first one on my ship to see those Jap zeros coming down on our ship. I ran to the bridge, I got the machine gun, I began firing at them right away. [MAKING MACHINE GUN NOISES] [LAUGHTER] I got two of the bastards before I was hit. So you are a hero of the war? [LAUGHS] No, Ferrari. I'm only kidding. I was wounded in New York City's combat zone. But that was after the war. I was hit in the heart by cigarettes, booze, cholesterol. You name it. You know, fate's a funny girl. Too bad, she couldn't have finished the job. Oh, no sir. You must never talk like this. For me it is enough to be alive. Blind or deaf... Even without arms, or legs is... Without anything. Well, maybe not without anything. But, uh... No. No. Maybe not. You have a beautiful wife. She loves you very much. You can see it. She's always looking to be sure you are there. Like she's almost afraid to not find you. Sorry, sir. Have I said something wrong. Oh, you're a good kid, Ferrari. I must remember to make our bookings. We don't want to miss the Pyramids. You're joking. Arabs, smells... Filth, camels. No, it's not for me, Margo. Not for me. But it is for me, Pierre. And I don't care whether you come or not. What's the matter with you? How kind of you to finally ask. I have brought up three children for you. I have given you my love and loyalty. I have put up with your existential crisis and your affairs. For 20 years I have permitted you to teach me things I know better than you. [WAITER SPEAKS ITALIAN] Perfecto. This cruise was not so much a gift, as a sort of bone you threw to me to keep me quiet. I knew that. What is the matter with me? Maybe I'm tired of you, Pierre. Or maybe I'm tired of us. I shall be thinking about it at the Pyramids. You always say no. [LAUGHTER] Don't worry. I'll save you! [SPLASH] Oh! Hi. Hi. Come back. Where are you going? Listen, Cheryl, if you like, later we can all go together to see the Pyramids. No, I've seen them. You two go. Are you mad at me? Cheryl! I need some time alone, anyway. I get it. It is me. I just need to think. Fine. No, Helmut, I like you. I do. Hey! What about me? You too, Michele. Maybe that's the... I don't know... Listen, I have an idea. Today you will spend it with Helmut, and tomorrow with me. But I don't see how that could... Oh, the best man wins. I love it. Oh, I don't. It is not a game. When the tourists disembark in Alexandria, I will leave the ship at the very last moment. Pretending to be worried. When the boys ask what has happened, you will say, &quot;The steward came into the cabin and saw the weapons.&quot; That's what you suspect. So you must take immediate action. Or you will be captured. I hope they believe me. Even Arafat will believe you. Alena, my love, there are so many things I would like to tell you. But I'm here only to fight. And that's how I want you to remember me. Sometimes I dream of the day when I'll be able to shake an Israeli's hand. Look into his eyes and say, &quot;Let's stop fighting. Let's find a solution.&quot; But it's not possible. We want everything and so do they. For us, there is no country called Israel. There is only Palestine. And he day after tomorrow, I will be there. And I will fight our enemy. [KNOCK AT DOOR] MAN: Bedding service. Can we make the beds? No, thank you. MAN: Do you need some towels? I said, &quot;No, thank you.&quot; It's not necessary. Ah! Less work for me. I've been trained to clean up big stations with standard. To hell with them. [SPEAKS ITALIAN] [MUMBLING IN ITALIAN] [SHIP HORN HOOTING] MAN: Mr. Petros, I have your photographs and your negatives. Thank you, very much. MAN: Okay. Thank you, sir. You have my card if you need anything else. [WAVES SPLASHING] So, you'll be a good girl, huh? And do as your Grandma tell you, okay? Yes, Mummy. We'll be back tomorrow. I wish you were coming, too, Mama. No. No. I will be just fine with Jincia. Don't worry. Goodbye. Enjoy yourself. Daddy! Thank you. Oh, I appreciate it so much, Mama. You'll never know, really. I know. I know. Bye, Mama. Bye bye. Bye bye, baby. We'll see you tomorrow in Port Said. Bye bye. [BELLS SOUNDING FAINTLY] ANTONIO: We're over here. I wish she didn't insist on going. The sun is murder. Cover yourself with that scarf. Put it on your neck. Okay. Okay, I go. Thank you, Antonio. Enjoy your day. See you tomorrow in Port Said. LEON: Oh, dear. It's warm. LEON: Not so fast, Marilyn. LEON: Not so fast. MARILYN: What's the matter, Leon? You all right? LEON: I'm all right. LEON: All this noise and confusion. MARILYN: Look, honey. We don't have to go. I mean, it might be too tiring. LEON: Listen, darling. You can't come to... You can't come to Egypt and not go to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx. Quit fussing. Look, Leon. I think you're going because you think I wanna go. I mean, I-I-I couldn't give a damn. All I want is to be with you. Oh, God. I don't know what I wanna do. Okay, Leon, we're gonna go back to the ship. Your guests won't mind. Wait a minute, I'm all right. Leon we're gonna go back to the ship. I think it's best. Now, let's just take one day at a time. Look, we'll just keep the Cohens company. Oh. Okay? Marilyn, over here! Rose, we're gonna take a rain check. So, you have a great time. We'll see you tomorrow at Port Said. Don't worry. We'll bring you a nice souvenir. Bring back a belly dancer. [BUS DOOR SWISHES SHUT] I thought they were dying to see the Pyramids. Poor Marilyn. She really doesn't look too well. What? Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Today's our day. Let's have a good time, okay? You're right. To hell with Leon. If I find a belly dancer, I'll keep her for myself. You would. [CHUCKLES] I am sorry I'm late. But I must go ashore. But you are not on the list for the tour, Mr. Petros. No, I'm afraid I have to leave this beautiful cruise. PETROS: My wife is sick. No, no, I already have my passport. LADY: All right, go ahead. Thank you. Shukr. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENS] What's going on? I just saw Petros leaving the ship now. We've been found out. I believe a steward saw the arms. He can't have. I'm telling you, he did. He saw us. If he had, they would have arrested us by now. Shut up. I am the leader, and I tell you we have no choice, but to hijack this ship. It's crazy. This is not our plan. I have a new plan. You mean, just the four of us, alone? On such a big ship? That is why, they will never know how many of us there really is. Well. There aren't so many passengers aboard now. So, we can do it? For what? And why an Italian ship? Huh? Why? It's Israel who we must fight. We are to free our brothers. What difference does it make whether we make our stand from here or from Israel? I am a soldier, and I don't want to fight against unarmed people. For us they are our enemies. All of them. We are at war, brother. [SHIP HORN HOOTING] [KNOCK AT DOOR] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Who is it? [KNOCKING CONTINUES] I thought I wouldn't see you again. Well... I couldn't stay away. I'm glad. But I'm also still... I'll see you in the restaurant. I'll be waiting. MICHELE: So, first round is yours. Come on, I'll buy you a champagne. Thank you. But the next round is mine. [SPLASHING] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will reach Port Said. Those of you who wish to visit the city, please contact the purser's office. Thank you. [ANNOUNCEMENT IN ITALIAN] [ANNOUNCEMENT IN FRENCH] [LAUGHTER] [GUN SHOTS BEING FIRED] Come.

There are many of us, understand? Yes. But you've got to understand that we have more than 300 people on this ship. There is bound to be panic. I'll do what I can. But your men... have to keep very, very calm. My men are soldiers. Stop the ship, now. Stop the engines. Move. MAN: Captain. CAPTAIN: Attention please. Your attention, please. This is Captain De Rosa speaking. All passengers and crew members, the ship has been taken over by a group of Palestinians. We are no longer underway. I ask that you all remain calm. No one is to take any action. It might endanger his life. And the life of others. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] Please proceed to the dining area. Don't be afraid. Proceed to the dining hall at once. [CAPTAIN SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] [ANNOUNCING THE SAME MESSAGE IN FRENCH] This is the Captain speaking. If we follow instructions carefully, nothing will happen to us. I assure you.

If I can find an excuse to go and get it. CAPTAIN: And then what? Suppose they've really planted their explosives? Look, we don't even know how many they are. What you need here is some brain work. They're only young boys. We've got to try and reason with them. We've got to get out of this mess. Without any more shooting. TERRORIST: Walkie talkie. You have walkie talkie? Hand them out. Take it. Do you hear me? -Hello? -I hear you. Up. Up. Move. Move. Get up. Get up. Move. Faster. Faster. Go on. Move everybody, move. CAPTAIN: No, no, no, no. My second in command, my radio operator.

At 1300 hours today, the passenger ship, Achille Lauro was taken over by a commando group belonging to the Palestinian Liberation Organization. In exchange for the release of the ship and its passengers the hijackers demand the liberation of 50 Palestinian prisoners now held in Israeli jails. [WHOOSHING] COLONEL: No. This goes... Colonel, sir. You are urgently wanted in the radio room. What's happened? All bases are on the alert, sir. There is a terrorist action in progress. A hijacking. Which airline? It's not a plane, sir. It's... Achille Lauro with 300 people aboard. COLONEL: Good God! A ship! Once again the innocent become victims in in a brutal, senseless war, between factions that care nothing for human life. The question the world is asking now are, &quot;What about the people?&quot; Over 300 hundred hostages trapped on a ship designed for their pleasure and comfort. The passengers left Genoa expecting to follow this route. But the hijackers took control of the ship as it left Alexandria. The pleasure cruise became a living hell. How can the people be saved? [ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this broadcast for an important news bulletin. At 13:00 hours today a Palestinian commando group hijacked the Italian passenger ship, Achille Lauro, with over 300 passengers aboard. It seems that they are asking for... [TALKING AND LAUGHTER] [NEWS BROADCAST IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE] STREET VENDOR: Want? Very rare. Very nice. Mademoiselle. Antique. Genuine. MAN: George, just like you. [LAUGHTER] [FOOTSTEPS] [SWOOSHING] PILOT: We are lifted now. Minute rendezvous, 90 minutes. The irony of this terrible event is that the Achille Lauro is an Italian ship That country has long been a friend to he Arab world. Sympathetic to their problems. Now Italy's call seems to be a betrayal of that friendship and an outraged world. The Italian Prime Minister Craxi has called an extraordinary cabinet meeting to face the choice. Military action or diplomatic negotiations. United States has exerted very strong pressure on the Italian government to stage a surprise military action. However the Italian cabinet remains firm insisting on finding a peaceful diplomatic solution. [WHOOSHING] [WHOOSHING] [WHIRRING] [NEWS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE] In this many hours the Achille Lauro has still not be located. The military might of the western powers seems helpless. Any news from reconnaissance? No one has sighted the ship yet, sir. [SIGHS] Total silence on their radio? Mm-hmm. Nobody's heard anything from them since that one message. They seem to have vanished. Grandma. Grandma. I want to go the bathroom. Huh? I want to go the bathroom. Bathroom. Please. GIRL: I want to go the bathroom. GRANDMA: Let the child go to the bathroom. GRANDMA: Please. TERRORIST: No. No. [CROWD TALKING INDISTINCTY] [PEOPLE SHOUTING] Stop! Stop! [GUNSHOT] [PEOPLE SCREAMING IN PANIC] [GUNSHOTS] We must take them to the bathroom. At least the women. Calm down, okay? Okay? I'll take her. TERRORIST: Okay? Okay. Shut up. Only the women. TERRORIST: Eight at a time. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. TERRORIST: That's it. For now. TERRORIST: Come. Okay? TERRORIST: Come. Come. That's it. Hey, what about us? Do it in the orchestra. Sons of bitches. Come on, everybody. Leon, they'll make an exception for you. I'll go ask him when he comes back. He seems almost human. No. I don't want a thing from them bastards. Speaking of bathrooms, as soon as we get back home, I'm going to redo one of ours. I want a Jacuzzi. And what's more, I can't stand that damned flowered wallpaper. What color do you want? Lilac. I think. I was hoping you'd say pale yellow. No. Lilac. But none of those damn flowers. None of those damn flowers. [WHIRRING] [FAINT LOCAL MUSIC PLAYING] LADY: Let us off, please. MAN: Ooh! What is that? Excuse me, please. Where are you? They are here to board the ship. Hey, Carla, look at the policemen. Our ship is not here. Carla. LADY: Your attention, please. Your attention, please. Everybody. The police wants everybody to go back on the bus. What's going on? What's happening here? Please understand that the ship has been taken over by a group of terrorists. ALL: What! MAN: What the hell are you talking about? Our child is on that ship. Jincia is there. Please help us and go on the bus. What about the passengers? Yeah. What about the passengers? It will be okay, please. Go on the bus. Jinny. LADY: What's going on? LADY: Please, everybody back on the bus. Please. LADY: Everybody, please. [WHIRRING] TERRORIST: We are waiting instructions, Syria. TERRORIST: Please reply. Syria. TERRORIST: Please reply. I've got something. OPERATOR: I will give you the coordinates. TERRORIST: Syria. We are waiting instructions. Please reply. TERRORIST: We are waiting instructions, Syria. Thirty two. Thirty East. Syrian Base here. Syrian Base here. KHALEED: I'm receiving you loud and clear. We have a message form the Captain of the ship. We have a message from the Captain of the ship. Did everything go according plan? Were there any incidents? TERRORIST: No, none. Everything is fine. Continue the operation as planned. KHALEED: Let the ship head for the Port of Tartus. Once there you will open negotiations with the Syrians. For an exchange of hostages. I'll join you when you reach an agreement. Thank you, Syria. [PHONE CLICKS] [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] We did it. We have the problem of what Arafat's going to do when he learns the truth. He'll never turn on his own Palestinian brothers. He'll have to accept things whether he likes it or not. Could be. The Achille Lau appears to be headed for the coast of Syria. She can't get there before tomorrow morning. Now, assuming that we get the authorization act, I suggest... a sea based attack outside the territorial waters of Syria, using a team of frogmen backed up with helicopter support. This way, Your Excellency. The foreign minister has a visitor at the moment. Oh! The American ambassador asked to see him. Ah! If you don't mind, I'd like a few words with my Italian colleague. Of course. It was a short meeting. The Syrian Foreign minister was caught off guard when I told him the Achille Lauro was headed for his coast. Do you have any concrete basis for thinking the Syrians are not acting in good faith? We picked up a radio message from a Syrian base ordering the ship to head for Tartus. I told them they better drop any such idea. Syria cannot go granting asylum to those bandits. Or even allow the ship to dock. I'm with you there. It is vital that no sympathy be shown toward an action against the innocent civilians. I want you to know we are ready to take military action in a defense of the US citizens held hostage. I hope Italy's position is equally firm. I want you to know, if it is decided that military action is unavoidable, the ship is Italian, remember. So any action will be undertaken by Italy. And no one but Italy. I want you to be clear that Italy's first concern is to avoid the shedding innocent blood. And we will do all we can to reach a peaceful solution. MAN: Excuse me, but the minister is waiting, Your Excellency. Excuse me. We'll continue this later. I will call you later. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Ah, Your Excellency. Please. I imagine you know the reason for my visit, sir. The Achille Lauro is at this moment heading for Syria. Yes, so I gather from your American colleague. Why Syria? Maybe they are hoping to receive some kind of assistance or support? Exactly what is it you are trying to say? The hijackers claim to be PLO guerrillas. And we all know that some of the more extreme Palestinian groups are based in Syria. Syria grants asylum to her persecuted Arab brothers. But I categorically reject the suggestion that my government has anything to do with a group whose identity we do not even know. I assume your government also disapproves for the act of piracy, performed aboard an Italian cruise ship. Of course we do. We condemn it entirely. Very good. Then there will be no problem over issuing a public statement expressing your condemnation. Our President is in Prague at the moment. I will inform him of the situation and pass on the requests of the Italian government. [ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING] [ARABIC MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] He said there many, but I've seen only four of them. Me, too. But it's a big ship. Do you think they'll try something? From the outside to free us? I'm sure they're considering it. But it can't be an easy decision. Then what about my gun? Ah, a revolver. They have Kalashnikovs. I suppose I could manage to disarm this boy. You want to give it a try? Of course, I do. But they have grenades, kerosene, and more than 300 hostages. You're right, sir. Could we have it a bit down? No. It's stop you from going to sleep. There's no danger of that. I couldn't close my eyes tonight even if you glued them down. It's a beautiful song from my country. I love songs. Passports. Who has the passports? Well, um... some of the passengers have their own, but most of them are with the purser. I want all the passports in the lounge now. Go. Go. Go. Go. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Go. But I want to stay with her. [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] TERRORIST: Stay. TERRORIST: Go. Go. Stay. TERRORIST: Over there. Over there. Passport. I couldn't find it. I looked everywhere in our cabin. I lost it. Where is her passport? CAPTAIN: Please. Please, keep calm. Don't worry. We'll find it. She's American? No, not American. Australian. Right, ma'am? Go with the others. Americans stay and the Jew. You. I am French. A French Jew. No, no, no. Then why are you so nervous? No. No. I'm not Jewish. I swear I'm not. You are Jewish. No, I swear. I'm not. You're making a mistake. How can I make you believe me? You don't know your Jews buddy. Now this is a Jewish face, Jewish? And American. TERRORIST: Stay. Stay. Join the others. Maybe you know now what it's like to be inside the skin of a Jew for a moment. I said, &quot;Go join the others.&quot; TERRORIST: If we are attacked tonight, you will all die. British, American, Jews. They are my people's enemies. CAPTAIN: Enemies are people who fight. These people are innocent civilians. Their only fault is having one passport, rather than another. If our conditions are met and nobody launches an operation against us, then all passengers will be freed. We will cooperate in every way. You need not worry. Worry? We do not worry. It is you who should worry. Because you all want to live. But we boarded the ship prepared to die. [YAWNING] [COUGHING] Leon. Why don't you try to get some rest? I'm not sleepy. I'm watching our enemy. They all look so young. MARILYN: That one can't be more than a boy. [SIGHS] MARILYN: Do you think he knows what he's doing? You can bet he knows. He got a gun and he knows how to use it. [SIGHS] They look more frightened than we are. I was frightened too during the war. But it didn't stop me from killing. You know it's ironic? It's the kind of thing you watch on television at home or read about in the newspapers. And now here it is happening to us. Doesn't seem possible. [SIGHS] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] But you know... I would like to talk to them. Ask them a few questions. Who know, maybe... maybe something would happen. It's a nice idea, Leon. He wouldn't listen to you. We're symbols, Leon. We're not people. My dearest heart, what would you know... Well, if they could act like human beings instead of... I don't know... It just seems to me that the world is big enough. That there could be a place for them. [WHOOSHING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What does it say? What does it say? We are inside of the Syrian coast. The Port of Tartus is over there. Assadi! Assadi! We've reached Syria. Assadi! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [YELLING] Syria! Syria! Syria! TERRORIST: Eat. Eat. We're in Syria? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey! [JUBILANT MUSIC PLAYING] Is it good? This is good. I just got it. I got it. What? Bathrooms. Wallpaper. Lilac. I hate lilac. [LAUGHING] Leon. Oh, darling. [CHAIN CLANKING] [WATER SPLASHING] Micro set four and a half, Captain. Thank you. TERRORIST: Request radio contact. Give your call signals. I want to speak to our representative of Syrian government. CAPTAIN: Call Syria. Already on the line, sir. Captain De Rosa, the passengers ship Achille Lauro calling. The spokesman of the group has taken over our ship. Wants to speak with an official representative of your government. We took 80 passengers hostages. You understand Arabic, don't you? A little. Get it on tape. I gotta listen to this. And we demand that you free 50 Palestinian hostages. He's reading a communique announcing a successive... Wait a moment. Something's wrong. How you do this to us? We are your brothers and this is how you treat us. What are they saying? I don't understand too well. But the tone's changed. The Syrians are treating him like dirt, Captain. They say he's a bandit. There will be no negotiation. [SPEAKING ARABIC] What did he say? He's going to start killing the passengers one every hour. Nobody move. Nobody. TERRORIST: If he move, kill him. [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC OVER RADIO] TERRORIST: Aah! [GUNSHOTS] [PEOPLE SCREAMING IN PANIC] American! British! And Jews! [GUNSHOTS] TERRORIST: Now it's your turn. [CHILDREN CRYING] British, Americans, Jews. Up. You are a Jew. Jew, up! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] There. Get out of here! Go! TERRORIST: When we signal, stand. [GUN FIRING] TERRORIST: You and you. Up! Go over there. Quick! Shh. [GASPS IN FRIGHT] Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Press. Press. Press. If you let it drop, you die. [CHERYL BREATHING HEAVILY] We all die. We all die! Nice. Go. Go. Shh. Shhh. Shh. You. No! I lied to the Captain. I'm not an Australian. I'm an American Jew. There. Stubborn old girl. Move! Please. [PEOPLE SCREAMING IN PANIC] Don't move! [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] Help that man up, quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Come on. Help that man up. Quickly. Move. Up. Up. Up. Move. Move. Ow! Hey! Hey! That man stays. Come. No. Come. Come. No! Leon! Leon. Don't worry, honey. Don't worry. You'll be safer here. I'll be all right, sweet heart. Don't worry. Oh! Easy. Easy. That man stays down. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go back. Go back. Go back. You, too. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Go back. Go. Go back. Please, my wife. Will you see that she covers herself? The sun. The sun is terrible for her, you understand? You see, she is a very sick woman. Please see to it that my wife covers herself. The sun is terrible for her. And the heat. The heat is torture. What would it cost you to let her stay with me? My wife has cancer. Let us stay together. We haven't... We haven't been separated for a single night or a day in 30 years. Let us stay together. Doesn't matter what you do to us. As long as we're together. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Move. Move. Move. Now. Move. Move. Move. Let's go. Let's go. TERRORIST: Come on, everybody. Move. TERRORIST: Move. All over the place. Move. Move. Ah! Move. Move. Let's go. Let's go. Move. Move. Move. Move. Go. Go. Go. Go! On the ground. Hands up! TERRORIST: All of you. You, too! On the ground. Everyone. Hands above your head. You, too. On the... On the head. Shh. Shh. Give it to him. Don't be afraid. Open. Give it. Don't scared. Give me that. That's it. Nice. Okay. Now get down. Nice. Hands up on your head. Marilyn! All right? TERRORIST: Shut up. Everybody. [GRENADE BLASTING THE AIR] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] Since the Syrians let us down, we'll begin killing passengers. Look, listen to me. I can help you. I can negotiate for you. Perhaps if they hear my voice... Music. Put on some music. [OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD MURMURING] [OPERATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] TERRORIST: You! TERRORIST: Bring that man up now. TERRORIST: Move it. Now they will see that we are serious. Molqi. Molqi. Molqi! Can you hear me? LEON: Where are you taking me? Go! One. Two. Three. Push. Ferrari. Push. TERRORIST: Faster. Faster. TERRORIST: Faster. Molqi. This is Assadi speaking. ASSADI: Can you hear me? Molqi? ASSADI: Please answer me. Where are you going? ASSADI: Molqi! MOLQI: Now, go away. Go away! MOLQI: Move! [OPERATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] What do you want on your headstone? Jew? [GUN COCKING] [MUSIC INCREASES IN PACE] What do want on yours? Bastard. [GUNSHOT] [GLASS SHATTERS] [GUNSHOT] If you move I will kill you. [MUSIC GETS FASTER] American. That was the first one. Call the Syrians again. This is the passenger ship, Achille Lauro calling Syrian Port authorities. Come in, please. Syrian port authorities, come in please. Do you think they really killed an American? The passengers seem calm. I think he's bluffing to frighten us. I certainly hope so. But look at his shoes. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SOFT, POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING] [SHATTERED GLASS BEING MOVED] [CRYING] MAN: This is a representative of the PLO. MAN: Calling from the cruise ship, Achille Lauro I got something. 506. 43 Megahertz. ... now confirmed what I have just said. CAPTAIN: This is the Captain of the Achille Lauro, speaking. The Palestinian commando, now in control of this ship has informed me, that one of the hostages has been executed. CAPTAIN: If the commando doesn't receive, adequate guarantees, of the immediate release of the 50 Palestinian prisoners, they will execute one hostage, every hour. Beginning from this moment. [WHOOSHING] General Davies, sir. The Syrians are answering from Tartus. &quot;Leave Syrian territorial waters immediately. Or we will fire on the ship.&quot; [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] The terrorist wants some explanation. &quot;Why? Why? We are your brothers.&quot; [SPEAKING ARABIC] &quot;I repeat, 'Leave our waters immediately.' That's all. Over and out.&quot; I'm picking up a news broadcast. Listen. Starting with Arafat, practically all the Arab leaders have condemned the hijacking. calling it the work of pirates. Libya's Colonel Gaddafi has passively approved the criminal action. While news is still... We leave here now! Are you sure? Maybe we didn't understand each other. Start the engines. What course? We are going to Libya. Massa. Prepare to re-anchor. Yes, sir. You. Throw the body in the sea. Move, or I'll kill you, too. Move! [CRYING] Please. I am not able. Go help. Go on. Throw the body in the sea. Now. [GUN COCKING] Move! Throw that body in the sea. Now! TERRORIST: Go on. Throw him. Throw it in. [SPLASH] The chair also. Throw it in. Now! Change yourself. Change yourself and clean the deck. [GUN COCKING] Everything clean. Remember, if you talk. We will find you and we will kill you. Even in 20 years. Never speak a word to anyone. [WHEEL SPINNING] RADIO NEWS: In the middle east, Palestinian terrorists take over Achille Lauro. PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat issued an official statement condemning the hijacking the Italian ship. Adding that the terrorists are not members of the PLO, but common criminals. He asks that they be given no support of any kind. Syrian authorities have already refused to give the hijackers... [BANGS TABLE] We are alone now! The provision is a fiasco. A fiasco. Even the Syrians don't want anything more to do with us. That's not all. I just spoke with Tunis. Arafat discovered the truth and is out to get all the people responsible. [PHONE RINGING] I'll go. [PHONE CONTINUES TO RING] Yes? Yes. Of course. I see. That's right. I'll leave at once. He's turning the whole thing around to his own advantage. Arafat is sending me to represent the PLO negotiations with the man on the Achille Lauro. What! He's making me responsible. For seeing that all the hostages are freed, without any bloodshed. He's got you right in the middle. No way yo can win. Of course, you could hide in Syria or Lebanon. And be hunted forever? No. Perhaps I'd be safe if I do what he says. What can he do to a man who saved hundreds of human lives in the name of the PLO? We're moving. Bring them down to the lounge. Molqi. Molqi. What have you done with the sick man? You didn't kill him? Was he alive? [WHISPERING] Are you crazy? Bring them to the ground. Why did you do it? You are not here to question me, so keep your mouth shut. It's going to be okay. Now, go. Up. Up. Up. Everybody up. We are going back. Come on. You want to move over there. Come on everybody. TERRORIST: Up. Up. TERRORIST: Come on. Come on. TERRORIST: Go. Go. Go. TERRORIST: Come on. Go. Go. Go. [VOICES OF PEOPLE TALKING] Leon. Didn't take his medicine. [PEOPLE TALKING AND LAUGHING IN RELIEF] Antonio. Where's Leon? I don't know. You don't know? I'm sorry. Sir, I want you to tell me what you've done with my husband. I beg you. Please. Go. Answer me. In English you son a bitch. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Calm down, please. Calm down. Do you want to die? Lets all calm down. Everybody. Everybody. Calm. Calm. Now the lady is going to calm down. And come with us and sit down with all the others. Where is... where is Leon? Please. Where did they take him? I've got a feeling that you know... these people... even more nervous than we are. And if we provoke them, there could be a real massacre. This one seems to be more human than the others. Let me speak to him, okay? Excuse me. Excuse me. Can we speak to you? What? Mrs. Klinghoffer wants to know where her husband is. Oh, yes. He is... He's all right. He's all right Well, I mean, where is he? Where did you take him? Oh, he is, er... in the hospital. In the hospital? You mean, he fell sick? No. He okay. Only a little... Pain? Yes. Right. But he is take medicine. Tranquilizer. So now... he is sleep. I have to go to him. Please I want to be with him. No, you can't. It's not possible. But... I'm telling you... He's all right. Please. Believe me. He is all right. Believe me. [POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR PICKING UP SPEED AND MOVING] [SIRENS BLARING] Right. Washington on the line, sir. Mr. President. I have just met with Prime Minister Craxi. I told him that after the terrorists declaration that they had killed a hostage, my government was calling for immediate military action. And will he take that action? No, sir. He stated that before ordering such an operation, that could cause a massacre among the hostages, that his government wanted to explore every possible alternatives. And he made it clear that any military action, against the Achille Lauro would be carried out by Italian forces. I want you to tell the Prime Minister, that I shall give him 24 hours. After which, the United States reserves the right to launch a unilateral military operation. Yes, sir. [ADHAN BEING CALLED OUT] Hello? Italian Embassy? Yes. My name is Luciano Serafini I am one of the passengers from the Achille Lauro. What's going on? No! Can't you give us any information? We know absolutely nothing. Janu come quickly. The news is on the radio. All right, I'll call back. Thank you. Bye. It's your turn. The Achille Lauro, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually happened. A Portuguese radio relay station claims to have picked up a message from the hijackers, announcing the execution of one of the hostages. ALL: [COLLECTIVELY GASPING] There are also some unconfirmed reports that special forces are to launch an attack during the night. Frantic diplomatic exchanges between the countries most concerned over the terrorist actions seem to be at a dead mark. Each claiming its jurisdictional rights in the matter. Further news on the hijacking of the Achille Lauro will be given at the next Voice of America, news roundup. All the women. Wake up. British. Americans. Jews. On your knees. Hands behind your heads. Cohen. Stanley. Me. [GUN COCKING] ALL: No! TERRORIST: It's your turn. NO! Are you afraid? Yes. Orson. Jack. I am here. Sherman. Abbot. I'm here. Jacobi. David. Here. No, no. Please. Adams. Cheryl. Yes. Ah! [THUD] [FEW PEOPLE COUGHING] Cohen Stanley. Come here. ALL: Ah! [PEOPLE GASPING IN FEAR] Now. Now think carefully. Think carefully about what your doing. If you kill any of the hostages, you will be giving them a good excuse to launch a military action. If your aim was to draw the world's attention, you've already succeeded. But if you really think it is necessary to kill someone to show how strong you are, you will stop with nothing. You will have to kill somebody important. The Captain. Represents the ship. So... you should kill the Captain. Lets go on deck. Captain. [WOMEN CRYING] Ah! Ah! Ah! TERRORIST: All right. Everybody down. Down. Everybody. Molqi. Molqi. Khaleed radioed that we are allowed to go Libya. He wants to talk to you. To give you our new course. Khaleed? Yes, yes. It was him. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Khaleed is waiting. We're changing course. You are a very lucky man, Captain. Let's go. You still need that thing? Nevaratashe here. Inform His Excellency that we are intercepting secret signals through the Achille Lauro. CAPTAIN: Okay. Can you hear me? Is that you, Khaleed? Can you hear me? I hear you, Khaleed. I think it's going to be possible to negotiate. We must salvage what we can. You have to go back to Egypt. Port Said. It will taken as a gesture of goodwill. You understand? Yes. It is very important to let people know that you have not harmed the passengers or crew. You understand what I'm saying? Yes, I understand perfectly. I promise I will bring you all home. Safe and sound. This Khaleed talks like he's behind the hijacking. We know he is one of the leaders of the radical faction of the PLO. And yet... Arafat sent him to negotiate with the terrorists. What does it mean? Trouble within the PLO? A double cross? What's going on? I don't know. Captain. We are changing course. Back to Egypt. Port Said. Something happen? Things are looking better for all of us. Does that mean there will not be any more executions? Anymore? I do not understand. Have you maybe seen an act of violence being committed on the ship? Captain, a little while ago, you said you represent this whole ship and everybody on it. This is your chance to bring them all safely. Don't waste it. None of us have slept for over 48 hours. Your mind can begin to play nasty tricks on you. [EXHALES] You're from Napoli. Have your kitchen make some good spaghetti. We love spaghetti and Italians. That is one of the reasons why we chose your beautiful ship. MAN: Good morning, gentlemen. I'm sure you realize I invited you here, as the representatives of the countries with the most citizens aboard the Achille Lauro. The ambassador from Italy. from United States. Great Britain, and the ambassador from Germany. Thank you so much for coming on such short notice. Please sit down. To start with I can tell you, that the first message received from the ship concerning an alleged killing was incorrect. It is now affirmed, that all is well. And there has been no violence and no victims. Who says this? The Captain. A man with a machine gun pointed at his head will say anything. The message continues. The hijackers want to negotiate the release of the ship and its hostages. And PLO is ready to send someone to mediate with the terrorists. That would be amusing. If it weren't so preposterous. But does this mean that the PLO is admitting its connection with the terrorists? Lets say that Arafat and his people think that the pirates could be part of a lunatic, splintered group. Fanatics. Who took independent action, That's why they're offering to reason with them. Such seems an acceptable basis for a negotiation If they are talking about unconditional surrender as being no violence. I agree. Too many ifs, and trust me, too many games. And who is this suddenly peace loving mediator? And when does he arrive? ARAB MINISTER: He should be arriving now in Port Said. He is a minor military leader. But he is much respected by the more extreme alliance of the organization. He should be the very man to negotiate with the pirates. He is known as Khaleed. But his real name is Abbas. Abu Abbas. Captain. Captain, energy and patrol boats. There. Look. [SHIP HORN HOOTING] Must be Khaleed. But it could be a trick. Bring everybody on the deck, stay undercover, and shoot if they attack [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SHIP HORN HOOTING] [PEOPLE TALKING AT ONCE] This is Captain Abu Abbas of the PLO. I want to speak with the Captain of the ship. I'm Captain De Rosa. I have been given the task of persuading the Palestinians who are aboard to release the ship and its passengers peacefully. That's what we're all hoping for. But you have to understand that we do not assume this responsibility. If they have committed some more serious crime, in that case, things would become very complicated. Everything depends on what you tell me. You understand Captain De Rosa? I understand. Everything is fine. Can you give me your word that there has been no act of violence? [GRIM MUSIC PLAYING] One seaman was accidentally injured. But not seriously. Accidentally harmed. ABBAS: Please describe the gravity of the incident. CAPTAIN: He fell and fractured his leg? Excuse me. Where is the sick bay? I got to find my husband. The sick bay is two decks down. But try to be patient, Signora, you can't go down now. It's not possible now. Look there. CAPTAIN: You have my word. Everybody on board is well. KHALEED: That is a relief. Can I speak to the leader of the Commando. Khaleed. I want to know if the American and the Italian ambassadors are with you. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] Prepare to leave the ship. And before you go, I want you to apologize to the Captain and all the prisoners. And that's an order. Thank you, Captain De Rosa. [PEOPLE SHOUTING JUBILANTLY] Helmut. Michele. Bravo. You were very good. Yes, you were. Bravo. Bravo. Prisoners. We are prisoners in this damn ship too. We are pawns. Cards in a stack deck. In a dirty game being played a long way from here. [BANGS DOOR] Cattle fodder. That's what we are. All of us. Don't you understand? Don't you understand? Well gentlemen, please accept our apologies, for the inconvenience. We took food, drinks, cigarettes. We are not bandits. We pay our debts. With good Yankee dollars, too. We pay all our damage. All of it? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] They just can't walk away so easily. Take. That's a souvenir. Take it. Take it to remember. Souvenir. You know what you can do with your souvenir. Nice. Bravo. Bravo. Captain, there is a call from Rome. Who is it? Prime Minister Craxi, sir. Hello. Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. Captain De Rosa speaking. Thank you. Yes, it's all over. Everyone on board is fine. But we have a passenger missing. Leon Klinghoffer. An American. CAPTAIN: Yes, we can't find him. CAPTAIN: For the time being, I'm listing him as &quot;Missing&quot;. Have the minister of justice draw up an immediate request of extradition for the four terrorists. Top priority. Advise our ambassador in Egypt at once. [ADHAN BEING CALLED OUT] I received two applications. One from the Italian government, and one from US government Both requesting extradition of the four hijackers. Murderers would be more accurate. Even if that's true, we didn't know about it when we took them into custody. But now we know the truth. And we want to make sure, justice is done. I'm sorry but it's too late to do anything about it. We already handed over the Achille Lauro hijackers to the PLO representatives. They left Egypt. Left? Where to? [EXHALES] Maybe PLO headquarters in Tunis? Yes. That would be it. Yes. Yes. Tunis. [CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS] [SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] What happened? Are you all right? Yeah. Better than I was before. [SOFT, MELLOW, MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAFFIC AND CLAMORING] [SPEAKING IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Officer, The PLO sent me to take charge of these men. Our police have to question them first. I am waiting for my superiors now. Can I have a word with the leader of the group while we wait. Yes, all right. Thank you. Is what you said about the ship's radio true. That you killed an American? Yes. When the Syrians said that they did not want to negotiate, I had to show them that I meant business. Of course. But did anybody see the killing? No. And when we got to Tartus and they made us leave I had them throw the body in the sea. Way out into the sea. Good. Good. They will never find it. And if they don't find it, they can't accuse of anything. Enter. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [CAMERA FLASHING] [SPEAKING ARABIC] Listen to me. Get this straight. All of you. You volunteered for a service and mission in Israel. And you took over the ship because the steward discovered you. They'll never find the dead man, and you know nothing about him. That's your story for the Egyptians and the Arafat too. If you care about your lives, make sure you stick to it. You're a liar. And you tricked us. And I know the truth now. And I'm not going to play your game anymore. Yellow bastard. Stop it. Stop it. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] You betrayed the codes of the PLO. We will make sure you will stand trial for this. We had no choice, the steward saw our arms. You'll be judged by the Palestinian court. And you'll pay for your mistakes. I tell you, a steward saw the arms. We had no choice. But I have. Traitor. I'm telling you... And no one's going to pay. For we came. You liar. You tricked us. You think you won, huh? You think you won with this game? You're finished. [CAPTIVES TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Excuse me Ma'am, but the terrorists and other people are denying that your husband was actually killed They're saying that maybe he just got sick during the hijacking and fell into the sea My husband was murdered and thrown in the sea. How come you're so sure, Mrs. Klinghoffer? The Captain told me. Yes, but the Captain didn't actually see the killing. My husband was murdered and thrown in the sea. We believe you, Ma'am. But you realize without the body, it won't be easy to make the charge stick. Yes, I know. Well, I'm personally convinced that the hijackers will have the courage to come forth and tell the truth. I don't think they can keep such a terrible burden hidden inside for very long. Suppose, just suppose, they don't confess? Well, I have courage in the law. In my... They killed an old man, they killed a cripple. A man who couldn't fight back. My husband was killed in cold blood and thrown in the sea. Yes, but, excuse me, Ma'am, have you considered the legal aspects? No court in the world will accept just simple hearsay. General Davies, Cairo has intercepted a call. No, no. Before them it must be on that Egypt ambassador plane I told the Ambassador that the Achille Lauro hijackers already left Egypt. No, no. The Americans and Italians must be crazy, if they think we can hand them those Palestinians. Don't they realize that Egypt's an Arab country? The PLO would say it's a betrayal of our own brothers. No, no. Absolutely not. No. No. They must take the blame. I'm sorry. Goodbye. They're still on Egypt. They never left. It was a lie. Now, we make our move. Those people are not home free yet. Yes, Colonel. I think we've got the break we've been looking for. We've intercepted a conversation from Cairo between the Egyptian Foreign minister and one of his aides. The four Achille Lauro hijackers and their leader Abu Abbas are still in Egyptian territory, despite declarations to the contrary. GENERAL: They are leaving Cairo at 2200 hours tonight local time, on an Egypt air common carrier passenger plane. Yeah. Right. General Davies is on the line Mr. President. We've just got the final confirmation we've been waiting for. The aircraft left Cairo and the murderers are on board. Get them. General Davies, the president says, &quot;Get them.&quot; [SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING] May I? Yes. Reporting now. ETA is 0400. [BUZZING OF AIRCRAFTS] [FAINT BEEPING] Falcon 7 to base.

By all means, Falcon 6. Greetings. It's show time. Ah! TERRORISTS: Look. Airplanes. MAN: Americans. Contact base. Contact base. I can't. They've jammed our communication system. Are you with me? It's outrageous. This is an Egyptian civil aircraft. They can't do this. This is piracy. We've already told them that. And what did they say? Follow us, or we'll bring you down. Falcon 7 here. What our destination please? Hang on. Anywhere from Cyprus. They've refused landing permission, Sir. And the nearest NATO base is Sigonella, Sicily. Falcon 7 escort the plane to Sigonella airbase. That's eastern Sicily. We'll be following you. GENERAL: When we get there, we'll take them in custody. I copy. Can you finally tell us where we're going? Yes, of course. You're going to Sicily. Where you'll be able to identify to terrorists. This way, madam. Any identification? Not so far. How many of them? Three plus one, and They're heading this way. PRESIDENT: I'm asking you as head of the Italian government, to authorize the Egyptian aircraft, with the murderers and hijackers onboard to land at Sigonella NATO base. together with the American aircraft now escorting it. Are you sure of the identity of those abroad the Egyptian aircraft. Beyond the shadow of a doubt. In that case we are pleased to cooperate, Mr. President. I'll permit them to land. Falcon 7, we have a, go force 'em down, now. I copy, sir. We'll get them down. Hang on. PILOT: US Commander to Egypt air carrier. Start your approach, Captain. You have a four minute touch down. It seems that the Italians are going to let us land. [PHONE BUZZING] It's the headquarters, sir. They have orders from Prime Minister Craxi. Yes. Colonel Annicchiarico speaking. Yes, Sir. Yes. Yes, I understand the situation perfectly. If they really are aboard, they will be turned over to nobody but an Italian magistrate. Yes, sir. Don't worry. Radio, Catanio. This is an emergency. I want all personnel on the main runway. Battle alert? And battle alert. Exactly. Catanio, on the line. Thank you. Falcon 7 in operations. Egyptian civil aircraft is touching down now. We'll keep patrolling the air space. She's all yours, General. Affirmative, Falcon 7. [WHIRRING] Get down. Get down, everybody. COLONEL: Nobody is to embark or disembark without my orders. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Look. Look. Americans. [VEHICLES REVVING] GENERAL: Move it. Move it. GENERAL: All right. Let go. GENERAL: Move it. Move it. Move it. Move it. Colonel. General Davies. I have orders to take custody. Terrorists are aboard this aircraft. Whose orders may I ask? The government of the United States of America. We are not in America. This is a NATO base. Which I have the honor of commanding. And which is on Italian soil. Are you saying you'll order your men, to prevent the capture of these terrorists? Using any means necessary? I will do whatever I consider my duty to ensure that international law and Italian jurisdiction are upheld. Get me Washington. I'm on the runway at Sigonella. The commander of the base refuses to hand over the hijackers. He says that the Italians have jurisdiction over the Achille Lauro terrorists. GENERAL: Do we want to use force? What do we do, Mr. President? Call Rome. I want to speak to Prime Minister Craxi. Mr. President, some of the passengers are leaving Egypt now. General Davies, passengers from the ship should be there in approximately three hours, to identify the terrorists. Keep your men where they are, Walter. Mr. Craxi, sir. Mr. Craxi, I need your help again. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [VEHICLES REVVING] Another 50 men are on the way from head quarters. The district attorney is coming. Thanks. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I'm requesting that you authorize the commander of the Sigonella airbase to hand the murderers of the American citizen Leon Klinghoffer over to the authorities of the United States. I understand your feelings, Mr. President. But I'm afraid that I cannot grant your request. The crimes were committed aboard an Italian ship. And under International law this means that that the accused are liable for trial by my country's courts. We will depend upon your government to see that justice is done. PRESIDENT: We have no desire to act unilaterally. [WHIRRING] Come on dear. Try and get some rest now. You know that Italian boy on the ship he... and Antonio. Leon called him his personal Ferrari. He told me that even to the very end, Leon stood up to them. He died like a man, Marilyn He'll laugh out loud if he heard that. He must've been afraid like anyone else when he knew he was gonna die. But I'm sure of one thing. He never lost his dignity. He says said, &quot; A man's got to keep his self respect whatever happens.&quot; I'm sure he did, Marilyn. We thought they were my last days, not his, [CRYING SOFTLY] Coffee, ma'am? Oh, thank you. We'll be landing within the hour, ma'am. The terrorist have left their aircraft by the time we get there. Do you want to carry your identification as soon as possible or do you wanna rest first? No, I'd like to do it first thing. In fact I just have to. Of course. I understand. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Take a seat. No, thank you. Your honor, Your country' port authorities refusing to allow my shop to sail. I know, Captain. And I feel very sorry for that. Yes, but I have more than 700 people to get back to Genoa. Your buses are free to go where they wish. If anyone need to leave Egypt urgently, they can take a plane. In other words, Egypt is holding my ship hostage. A second hijacking. You should be more careful in your choice of words, Captain. Hijacking is what your fellow countrymen and their American allies are doing are doing at this moment with the civil aircraft, belonging to my country. The Achille Lauro will remain under Egyptian authority [PHONE RINGING] Only until necessary investigation has been completed. Hello. Hello. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] [SPEAKING ARABIC] They're calling you for a moment. It's urgent. What's going on here? We thought we were free. But we are still hostages. Khaleed. I would remind you that according to International law, the ship is Italian territory. And any investigation falls under the sole jurisdiction of country. And I would remind you, that my country guaranteed the surrender of the four terrorists. After your own formal declaration hat no more serious crime had been committed aboard the Achille Lauro. I spoke with a gun pointed at my head. So, you admit that you lied? If I lied, so did the man who questioned me from your patrol boat, And tell me Your Honor, how many other people also lied, as you put it. Lets leave it, Captain. We can only make things worse. That's a good advice, Captain. Good advice. [BIRDS CHIRPING] General Davies. Some hot coffee. No. No, thank you. The commander of the base wants to see me. And wants the passenger list. Are you sure it's not a trick by the Americans? To make you open the hatch? I take full responsibility for your safety. In here you are under Egyptian territory and under my government's protection. Hey, our brother, how much did you sell us for? Tell your people to watch their tongues. Okay. But you and your government had better remember that the eyes of the whole Arab world and not only the PLO are on you. And you will be judged for what you do today. Saeed Iman, I represent the government of Egypt. Colonel Annicchiarico, commander of the base. I have with me General Davies and the district attorney from Syracuse. You have no objection if they are present at our discussion do you? On the contrary, I take this opportunity to express Egypt's shock and indignation at such an unwarranted act of piracy on the part of a country like the United States that we regard our friends. I'm a soldier. I follow orders. You have complaints? File them from a diplomatic channel. I hold it jointly responsible for this violation of international law, Colonel. I formally request that you allow our aircraft to leave. Yes. But after you allow us to identify the passengers you have aboard. We have reason to believe that the Palestinians responsible for hijacking the Achille Lauro and the killing of one if its passengers are aboard your aircraft. You also have the leader of the Palestine Liberation front one Abu Abbas , alias Khaleed, Abu Abbas is protected by diplomatic immunity. So he is aboard? The hijackers must be handed over to us. I'll have to consult my government before taking any decision. The telephone is at your disposal. Marshallo, take this gentlemen to the phone. And now they let us decide what happens. We don't meddle anymore. If you have indeed. Shut your mouth! The enemy is right outside. And what we are doing? Hiding in here like rats. Let's attack them, Captain. They will kill us. But who know show many we can take with is. Like we were going to do in Israel, Captain. Well, I'm ready. What about you? You sound like a hysterical woman. And you are a liar and a traitor, I swear, if we get out of this, I will have you shot. [EXCLAIMING IN ANGER] [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] It's a delicate situation. Are you willing to hand over your men to the Italian authorities? Can't we persuade them to let us leave? Even if we could, I wouldn't do it. Think about it. As long as we are here, we have some protection from the Italians. But as soon as we take off, the Americans will catch s again. And who knows how things will end next time. At least here, every minute that passes is in your favor. If they were ready to go all the way with the military action. They would have done so immediately, I'd say. And in any case, before turning over your men, the Americans must leave. That is the condition which I told the Americans that we will not renounce. GENERAL: Yes, sir. Yes, of course I understand. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Captain. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Yes, sir. Colonel, my detachment is leaving Sigonella three of my men and I will stay as observers, if you have no objection. Not at all. [MAN SHOUTING ORDERS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] They are going. The sons of dogs are leaving. They leave, but we stay. KHALEED: This is a great victory, bothers. A slap in the face for Yankee arrogance. But the Italians, they will put us in prison. The dead man will have been eaten by sharks. You just deny everything. They cannot accuse you if there is no corpse. Anyway, you will have a trial. With newspapers, radio, television. So the whole world can see you. And you can tell them the reasons of our struggle. We'll do it, Khaleed. We know you will never abandon us. Don't worry. You won't be inside for long. In a few month's time, we will hijack a plane belonging to the country holding you. And force them to release you. I promise. US Troop transport leaving Sigonella. Please reconfirm. NATO air route. This is Davies. I'm on the runway at Sigonella. The doors just opened. They're coming out. You just say a word, I swear I'll kill you. Yeah. [TIRES SCREECHING] [WHIRRING] Those are just the henchmen. You know that. Their leader is still on this plane. [CAMERA FLASHING] We did not kill anyone. I never saw an American on the ship in a wheelchair. I have only 16 years. I know nothing about that American. If what you say is true, it is not we who kill. My job on the ship was to guard the passengers. I do not know anything about a murdered American. I remember an American woman came to me and said, she cannot find her husband in the ship. The Captain said, &quot;Maybe the man was scared and fell in the sea.&quot; All Americans are cowards. Signor. Mrs. Klinghoffer? Yes. My condolences, Madam. We require formal identification to avoid any question of a mistrial. You understand? But if don't feel up to it, the other witnesses will be sufficient. No, I want to look them in the face. Oh, yes. Very well. Mow, Mrs. Klinghoffer you recognize any of these men, as those who took part in the hijacking of the Achille Lauro. Him. Him. Him. Him. Liar. Well, gentlemen, my job is over. The Achille Lau hijackers are in the hands of Italian law. Goodbye. Just a minute. What about their leader? Yes? Aren't you even gonna question the man? Their leader? Abbas. Abu Abbas. He's on that plane. The others simply followed his plan. He was the architect behind the whole thing. He's right there. Excuse me, General, but you have sufficient proof of what your saying? No, they're building a file in Washington. But we have the conversations recorded. What can I say? I need proof. If and when you have something concrete, we'll examine it. Remember Mr. Abbas has a diplomatic passport, and is under our protection. I demand that you authorize the immediate departure of our plane. In fact, as things stand, I have no legal justification foe refusing. That's insane. I have no legal grounds for holding that aircraft, General. As far as I'm concerned, it has permission to leave. [FOOTSTEPS WALKING AWAY] I can't believe it. All this, for nothing. Not for nothing. We have four of them. That's a good beginning. I know how you feel, General. I feel the same way. But there are no winners or losers here. Just soldiers doing their duty. Annicchiarico you are one tough, obstinate son of a bitch, and you are an officer I would like to have with me. Maybe you'll like to have that coffee now, General? I'd like to have a cup of coffee with you. Okay. [WHIRRING] There is a great deal of conjecture as to the true motives of the Lauro hijacking. Apart from the unfortunate Klinghoffer incident, several middle east experts feel that Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails was just a ploy. A cover for a more... News round up with Dino Moran The general criminal court has handed down sentences for the four Palestinians responsible for the hijacking of Achille Lauro and the slaying of Leon Klinghoffer. Al Assadi who disassociated himself from the others and made a full confession has been given a sentence of 15 years. Molqi, Fatayer, and Al-Asker have been given sentences ranging from 20-30 years. One of the organizers on board was this man know as Floros Petros. His real identity has never been established. Nor does any photograph exist. We are showing you a drawing made by a police artist based on the Al Assadi identification. Abu Abbas the ring leader of the whole operation and military chief of the four terrorists has been given a life sentence in Italy. But he remains free and in fact occupies a major position of power within the PLO. A few days ago in an interview in Algiers Abbas made the following statement. Who? That American? Oh. I don't know anything about him. Probably jumped in the sea to rake a swim. We remind you that days after the killing where the terrorists were emphatically denying any knowledge of Klinghoffer's death his body was discovered on a Syrian beach and handed over to the American authorities. Sadly Marilyn Klinghoffer. Leon's widow did not live long enough to see his killers brought to justice. In fact she had been ill for sometime and survived her husband by only three months, Now I know I'm in Italy. I'm kidnapped. I ran to that bridge, I grabbed that machine gun and started firing. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta Chik. Chick. I got two of them bastards before I was in. Antonio, you drive too damn fast. And you go right through red lights. You're one hell of a driver. Thank you, sir. * So long ago * So far away * Two hearts in love * And stars above * And make-believe * As soft as slow * I sail away * Come back with me * Across the sea Of memories * Do you remember * Those golden days * Come sail away * Come sail away
