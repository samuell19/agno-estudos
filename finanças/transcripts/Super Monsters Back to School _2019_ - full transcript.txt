Is she? Is she? What's taking so long? Why aren't they here yet? Don't worry, Lobo. It's a long drive from Ciudad Monstruo to Pitchfork Pines, but I'm sure your cousin Vida and her parents will be here soon. I got you! I can't believe Vida is going to live right next door! Won't that be great? We get to play together every day, you, and me, and Vida, and all our friends. And she'll come to Pitchfork Pines Preschool with me too! It's going to be amazing! She's here! - Vida! - Hi, Lobo. Is Vida here yet? No, and I've been waiting forever! Oh, we'll wait with you. We have paper and paints. So we can make a sign to welcome Vida and her family to Pitchfork Pines! Ha! Awesome! That was my sister, Lobo's aunt Maya. She says they're almost here! They're here! They're here! ♪ Spin each other Round and round ♪ ♪ Jump down and up And up and down! ♪ ♪ Stick together like we're glue! ♪ ♪ Cause that's what friends And families do! ♪ I'm so happy you're here! We all are! Welcome to Pitchfork Pines, Vida. Gracias, Esme. What a sweet little plant! Oops! I got so excited, I used too much magic. That happens to me all the time. Hola, Abuelita! Hola, tío Jorge! Hola, Vida! Welcome to your new home. Why don't you let Esme, Katya, and Lobo take you on a tour of Pitchfork Pines? Great idea, Jorge. All of the Super Monsters made a list of our favorite places in Pitchfork Pines. I can't wait to show you! Maybe you should take Skelly with you. I'm sure she's excited to get to know our new home. It's OK, Vida. New places always make me nervous. Me too. But hugging Skelly makes me feel better. OK, cousin Lobo. Skelly and I are ready to go. Let's go! Our first stop on your tour of Pitchfork Pines, is the petting zoo! This is where our monster pets like to stay when we're at school. Henri loves to play with the Wingoats, Bubble and Trouble. And Molasses likes to nap in the trees and nibble on leaves. It's OK, Molasses. I'm sure this tree would be happy to give you some leaves to eat. Wow! Oh, Vida, that was amazing! Yes, thanks for making sure Molasses has a tasty snack. Speaking of snacks, maybe we should go get something to eat too. Oh, I know just the place! Luigi's Pizza! Henri wants to stay and play with the Wingoats. And so do I. We'll see you at school tomorrow. - Goodbye! - Adiós! Welcome to Luigi's! The best pizzeria in Pitchfork Pines! It smells delicioso! Hi, Vida! Hi, Lobo! Hola, Frankie. It's so nice to see you again. Come have pizza with us. We ordered a whole bunch. I'm so sorry, everybody. I can't make any more pizza tonight. I don't have enough fresh oregano for the sauce. What's ora-- oragio? Oregano is the most important ingredient in my pizza sauce. I grow it in my herb garden. See? Oh, I can help with that! Wow! Oh, grazie, Vida. You are a super helpful Super Monster. De nada, Luigi. I like being helpful. Now I can make lots of more pizza sauce. And lots of more pizza. Now it's time for the amusement park! - Yes! - Goodbye! See you tomorrow! Wait till you see the Ferris wheel. It's my favorite ride in the whole park. - Look! There is Cleo and her mom! - Hi, Lobo. Hi, Vida! Don't you just love Ferris... wheels? Oh, no! Mummy power! Hah! Wow! I didn't know you could do that! My mom's been teaching me to use my mummy wraps like lassos. - Cool! - Cool! See that building over there? That's the natural history museum. That's where we're going next. Drac and Spike are going to meet us there. Oh, I love dinosaurs. - So do we! - Hi, Vida! Come say hello to Dippy, the diplodocus. Oh, dear! Spike, are you alright? I'm OK. But I don't know if Dippy is. Do you think I broke it? It's OK, Spike. I know all about skeletons. And this one is super strong. I think this Super Monster knows what she's talking about. She sure does. Vida, the last place on my list is the library. Zoe said she'd meet us there. - Bye, Vida. - See you tomorrow! Hmm, Zoe's got to be around here somewhere. Hey! Hi, Vida. How was your first night in town? It was wonderful, Zoe. Lobo's been showing me all of the Super Monster's favorite places. The library is one of my favorite places. There is so many wonderful books with so many amazing stories! The only hard part is deciding which ones to take home. And which ones to put back, until next time. Oh, and putting the books back where they belong can be a little difficult. Wow! Thank you, Vida. It's going to be so much fun to have you in school with us. Skelly and I can't wait. Oh, no. Skelly, my doll. She's gone! Don't worry. I'll find her. Not there. Nope. Not there either. Everything here is so new. New house. New town. New school. It's very exciting, but it's also kind of scary. And when I get scared, hugging Skelly makes me feel better. It's OK, Vida. I understand. We all have something that makes us feel better when we're nervous or afraid. That's right! And you need Skelly. So we're going to find her. I can't find Skelly. She's not in the library. I'm going to make some calls. We'll get all the Super Monsters to help search for Skelly. Thanks for coming, everyone. These are all the places we went tonight. Skelly has to be out there somewhere. Let's go find that doll! ♪ We can do anything When we pull together ♪ ♪ The power to help Is the best super-power ever ♪ ♪ Helping each other That's what monster friends do ♪ ♪ That's what they do ♪ ♪ When working together And having a great time too ♪ ♪ That's what monster friends do ♪ ♪ When a friend needs help the most ♪ ♪ That's the time to pitch in ♪ ♪ So let's all lend a hand ♪ ♪ And let the monster fun begin ♪ ♪ Helping each other That's what monster friends do ♪ ♪ That's what they do ♪ ♪ When working together And having a great time too ♪ ♪ That's what Monster friends do ♪ We're sorry, Vida. We looked, and looked, but, we couldn't find Skelly anywhere. It's OK. Don't give up. We'll keep looking until we find her. Skelly! Molasses found Skelly! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh! Hey buddy, I know it must've taken you all night to get here, but I'm so glad you did. I'm really happy to have Skelly back. But I don't think I needed to hug her as much as I thought I did. Really? Even when I felt nervous and sad, all of you made me feel better. - Oh, yes! - Oh, yes! Mamá, papá, I think we're going to be very happy living here, in Pitchfork Pines. Sun up! Super Monsters! Are you excited to start school tonight? I don't know. It's so different from my old school. What if I don't like it? Here's something I think you'll like. Abuelita made bean and cheese tortas for our snacks tonight. My favorite! Gracias, Abuelita. See, mija? Even though your new school may seem different, you'll still have lots of familiar things too. Your favorite food, and your favorite doll. And your favorite cousin. Me. OK, cousin Lobo. I'm ready to go to preschool and try new things. Remember, Vida. Lobo has been a student here for a while now. So if there's anything you need to know, just ask him. That's right! I know everything about this school. Vida, this is our teacher, Igor. Hello, Vida. But, I thought Miss Esme was my new teacher. I am. And so is Igor. At Pitchfork Pines preschool we have two teachers. Oh, in Ciudad Monstruo, we only had one teacher. She was really nice. Well, if having one teacher was nice, then having two teachers will be twice as nice. Having two teachers is different, but, I think I will like it. - Hi! - Hi, Vida! Hello, Super Monsters. Look! It's my favorite time of the day! Ours too! - Sun down! - Monsters up! Drac! Katya. Lobo! Zoe. Frankie! Cleo! Spike! Vida! Super Monsters! Who's ready for flying practice? - Oh, I am! - Me too! Mummy power! Time to fly! Oh, I've never seen a mummy who could fly! Cleo's mummy magic is amazing. But your plant magic is really amazing too. Thank you, Zoe. I like helping green things grow. Like this little plant. Wow! You really mega-sized that plant. I can do that too. Mega-size! Wow! Oops! Sorry, Vida. I didn't mean to scare you. Frankie-size! I've never seen a monster mega-size before. I'm the only one who can do it. This school has so many different kinds of monsters. With so many different monster powers. It's different. But I like it! - Really? - Yes! Hey, check it out! Let's take the shortcut. Wow! I just learned how to do a backwards somersault. Want to see? Vida! Watch me fly upside down. Whoa. You want to see backwards and upside down? Check this out. Even my moves have moves. Whoa! Whoa! I've got you! And I've got Skelly. Oh, thank you! Perhaps it's time to take this airshow outside? - Oh, sorry. - Yes. Oh, this big plant will look great in the front yard. I'm going to go outside and watch everyone practice their new tricks. Would you like to come? No, thank you, Igor. I think I've had enough new for now. Oh, I understand. Well, feel free to explore the school, and make yourself at home. OK, I will. Oh, that poor plant needs my help! Lobo, this plant needs some plant magic. And it needs some water too. It's very thirsty. I'll be back, fast, fast, fast. This little guy is pretty wilted. No one ever comes up here. They probably forgot it was even here. I'm going to give it lots of magic. And I'll give it lots of water. Wow, I think I used too much magic. And I think I used too much water! - Oh, what did we do? - Oh, no! Up here! - What's going on? - What's that? Fantastic! Hello, Victoria. What's that? Well, good evening to you too. Yes, it certainly has been a while. And we do have a lot of new faces. Allow me to introduce them to you. Super Monsters, meet Victoria. She's been a part of this house ever since it was built. But Victoria was feeling a little worn out. So she decided to take a nap. A very, very long nap. We're happy you're back, Victoria. Did you have a nice rest? Oh, I'm so glad to hear it. A good nap always makes me feel refreshed and energized. Oh, Victoria. We've really missed you. Super Monsters, say hello to Victoria. Vida, would you like to say hello? No, thank you, Igor. I've had enough new things tonight. Oh, Miss Organ? You can call her Victoria. Miss Victoria? Can I try playing something I learned from Grandpa Mash? Oh, thanks! Wow, Victoria, you're amazing! Victoria, may I have a turn? Thank you! - Got room for one more? - Ah-hah! Come on, Vida. This new organ is amazing. I think I'll just wait here. Victoria, would you please play something we can dance to? Wow, Victoria! You're amazing! Right! Well, look at that. Where did the time go? Sun up! Super Monsters! Done! How was your first night at preschool, Vida? It was new, and different.
