Yo! - Montana! - Hey, Mo! Hey, mate. Cool, yeah? - What's up, little man? - Get off me, mate! Later, man Hey. Hey, sket. Come here. Are you deaf? I said come here. Are you stupid? Think you can talk to me like that and just walk away? - Get out of my face, please. - What? Hang on! Hang on! No! Blazer boy! Wants to be a superhero. But this dickhead is going to get fucked up! Yo, Lorenzo, he works for Ryan and Pitt. Next time. Faggot. Come on. I better go. See you later. Hey, wait up! Which way are you going? Carter Street. Me too. Where do you go to school? Brunswick Secondary. Don't know it. I've seen you about. Always walking somewhere. What's your name? Montana. What kind of name's that? - Don't know. What's yours? - Jess. What kind of name's that? Don't know. It was my mum's. Do you want to get a Coke? Uh, I ain't got no money. It's all right. I've got some. Come on. What's up? Nothing. Why you so late, cuz? Move out my way. I'm still listening. We collected ten large off Reece around midnight. The whole thing was going like clockwork. - We got jumped after that. - How much did we lose? Nothing. Reece didn't want no more gear. He was meant to fly to Jamaica today to visit his mother. Are you lying to me? Look, I swear, all right? We didn't lose nothing. No money. No gear. Everything's cool Boss, go easy, yeah? Easy? Hmm. Remind me just how much we lost last month. They hit the lockup on River Road. 50 grand in gear. What the fuck? Please. No! And Fat Mikey got taken for 50 grand in cash coming back from the Chinaman. Now Reece Peters. He wasn't carrying anything, but that ain't the point. Now tell me what I want to hear. We find out who did it and we put them in the ground. All right, boss? You two, get out. There you go. 50 large. It's all there. Why were you late? - What? - Don't talk back to me. - Boss, come on, man. - Why were you late? Don't ever be late again. You hear? I say you hear me? Why don't you just give me a phone? For fuck's sake, Montana! Just get the fuck out of here! I'm going to have to make a decision about that kid. I say we do the little prick. Man, Montana's making us a small fortune. Why you wanna waste him? We should be taking care of the kid, rather than smacking him about. Are you serious? Do you think he ain't gonna find out the truth? And when he does, we're gonna have to kill him anyway. Right now nobody does anything. We've got bigger problems than Montana, you hear? Steven. Yeah? She's waiting. Reece Peters, 19. Previous for assault as a minor, also for possession of small amounts with intent. We're treating the Peters murder as a revenge killing. We're looking into brothers, cousins, gang affiliates, all the usual. All the usual what? The usual suspects who might hold a revenge motive, ma'am. What was Peters' C.O.D.? Death by stabbing. "Single entry wound from a double-edged blade. The blade passed in and out of the left lung, sliding between the fifth and sixth ribs without making contact. Wound analysis reveals negligible contusion and negligible rupturing of the skin tissue at the lateral points of incision." You can stop me anytime. The blade came out as neatly as it went in. Peters' killer is a professional of some kind who executed him quietly and in complete control. Hans Reidel, high-ranking Berlin cocaine dealer, executed exactly the same way in September. Reidel's killer is the lead suspect in a series of murders throughout the continent over the last two years. Sometimes with a knife, sometimes not. But the victims are always criminals of some kind. Are you seriously trying to tell me some vigilante killer is loose on the Winchester estate? That's exactly what I'm telling you. What did I tell you the other day, eh? You sell on my patch again, now pay me my dues. Or I'll bleed you... till you turn the right color. Zdravo, Slavko, zdravo. Glad you rang. I've been meaning to get back to you. I know. I lost. A bet's a bet and all that. We're gonna need a couple of weeks. 90 grand's a lot of money to pull together, my friend. Don't worry. Be a little bit on top for your inconvenience. Hello? Slavko? Fuck. Are you gonna let me go or what? Not bad. Not bad, man. With a bit of training, you might be okay, man. Thanks. Hey, listen. Get yourself cleaned up. The boss wants to see you. - What, now? - Yeah, now. Happy birthday! You thought we didn't care, innit? Yeah, yeah. Go on, go on. Hey, happy birthday, bruv. Happy fucking birthday! The little man's growing up, yeah? - Gonna pop his cherry tonight? - Fuck off! - Give the kid a break. - Chill. So what are you saying? I see you working that bag. You want to be a fighter? No, I want to be like you guys, innit? I want to dress like you, drive the same cars, have the same money, earn the same respect. All right, mate, let's just start off with a drink, yeah? Go on. Back that. Down it! Fucking back it, man! Why is he so vexed? Come on, go on, go on, go, go, go, go. Back it! Yeah! Right! Yo, straight there, straight back, yeah? Don't mess up the plan, bro. Straight there, straight back. Hey, Jess. - Hi. - What's wrong? You been at school? - Yeah. - Liar! There is no Brunswick Secondary on Carter Street. There isn't one anywhere. Ha! You been checking up on me? I'm being serious, Montana. Why are you lying? It's complicated. So why are you wearing a blazer? All right. I guess that's that. See you around. Jess! Jess, come on! Meet me sometime. Let me explain. I'll take you to Nando's! Just stop screwing around, all right? Yeah, whatever. Get off me! Keep straight, G. Walk, bruv. All right, all right. Walk properly, bruv, man. Youth said he got jumped. - What? - It's true! Some guy with a helmet on. Look what he done to my face. - Who was it? - He had a helmet on. You know Lazerus is gonna be pissed about this, innit. What did I do? - You know exactly what you did. - What? A hundred large in cash. What the fuck do you think you did? I didn't do nothing. He's lying. I can tell he's fucking lying. Don't you fucking lie to me! What are you doing, fam? Fucking sit down, man! Calm down, both of you! I'm going to make some calls. Where are we? My head hurts. Just hold tight, yeah. Think I got a lead on who took that money. W-What's going on? Go with Cal. I'll meet you in about an hour or so. Step out. Come on. We ain't got time to mess around. Montana, do as you're told, man! For fuck's sake! That's it. For fuck's sake! Get after him and kill him. That's what we've come here to do, that's what we're gonna do. He's over here! Look, I'm... Please! Ma'am. Looking radiant as always. Isaac Benjamin. Single shot to the head. He's over here! Bet he felt that one. The other victim's Cal Parsons. He got the knife. The wound fits our killer's profile. I want reports on my desk by 5:00. Is that clear? Crystal. Bitch is really starting to get on my tits. Yeah. Need to have a little chat. Usual place. That's better. No, no, no, no, stay with me, stay with me. You people. You stupid, dirty people. You need to understand. If you're going to steal my product, I'm going to cause you great deal of pain. Boss. It's Montana. He's done a runner. Hey, you've got some serious fucking explaining to do. What did I tell you after we did the warehouse? What the fuck do you mean, what did you tell me? Bruv, I told you, calm it. I said wait for the moment. But no, you keep on pushing. Do you know how close the boss came to wasting us? Fuck you, man, and fuck Lazarus! His days are coming to an end. Are you stupid? This ain't the time. Yeah? We had a plan. And jumping Montana weren't in the plan. Fuck Montana! What do you think it's costing us to build up a new crew? You think Lazarus is just going to bend over and let us do him? You don't get it do you? Montana is still alive. And whoever killed Isaac and Cal is still out there. Oh, fuck! What the... Hey, let me go! Tell Lazarus I didn't steal his drugs! Who is this... "Lazarus"? Fuck you! I ain't saying nothing! I watched you. Those men. They betray you. Go fuck yourself! Still dressing like rent boys, I see? Yeah, always the fucking comedian, ain't you? Who the fuck killed Cal and Isaac? Whoa there, Tonto. First things first. We've got some bitch at the Yard breathing down our neck. You two tearing up the manor is starting to give me a ball-ache I can happily live without. That's got nothing to do with us. Who killed Cal and Isaac? Funny that. She was asking exactly same question. So in a way, you brave little Zulu, it's got everything to do with you. Fuck you and fuck your bitch. We're paying you to watch our backs, and right now I'm not seeing it. We can cancel the deal anytime you like, boys. And I'd love it if you call me a bitch just one more time. Yeah? What about the kid? You found him? No, not yet, but we're looking. Maybe he's with the prick who put a bullet in your mate's face. What happens if we find him first? Kid might even come to us. Can't see that working out too well for you girls. Which brings us to the main event. What's this? A tip? It's 50. It is what it is. Where's the rest? Bruv, we lost two soldiers. We had to cover it. And like I told you, we're paying you to watch our backs, and right now I'm not seeing it. So you take care of who the fuck killed Cal and Isaac and then maybe, maybe we'll have something to discuss. You'd better pray we find him. From what I hear, he kills dumb little fucks like you in his sleep. Just have a think about that, yeah? Next time we have one of these little get togethers? Bring double. Or you and I are going to have a little falling out. I want to know about Lazarus. - Does he have other names? - What? You ever heard of "Ratko"? No, I never heard of Ratko. Eat. What the fuck's this? Don't like? Don't eat. Aw, fuck! Oh, fuck! Every time you curse, you insult me. Fuck you. Ah! You curse the man who saved your life, hmm? Fuck off! Oww! If you behave like dog, I treat you like dog. Ain't you the big man! What's your name? Montana. Dimitrije. Sounds like a vegetable or a curry or something. Those men, who are they? Work it out. You're the one that's been spying on me. What's the matter? You want to know what's the matter? They tried fucking killing me. That's what's the matter. One of my... All of my friends. Other than that, life's great. I've got a psycho hitting me on the face with a spoon, and my arm hurts like shit. The man who robbed you yesterday. What about him? You know who he worked for? What about the girl? What girl? Is she involved? How long have you been spying on me? Your arm... You okay? Fucking tiptop. Are you getting anywhere? Nope. Fifteen victims in the last two years. For fuck's sake. Who is this guy? What are you doing here? What are you fucking doing here, you fucking prick? You think I haven't heard about you and what you're doing? Don't fucking point at me like that, you prick. Am I a fucking mug? I swear down... Yeah. What the... Oh, my days! I warn you, boy. This is private. You have no right. You might want to know, that's Lazarus Ratko? This... is Lazarus? - Are you certain? - Yeah, I'm certain! You do exactly what I say. You don't speak unless I tell you to. You don't... Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay. I know, I know. Don't say nothing, don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing, don't... You say "don't" a lot. Don't be clever, Montana. Yeah, see? Oh... Just stay behind. Hey. Hey. What was all that about? Later. Are you okay? No, no! I'm sorry, D. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Breathe, breathe. Just breathe. We need to go now, Montana. Let me... Let me get this straight. Ryan, Pitt... and Lazarus, they killed my dad? I know how it feels. How? I'm sorry. Lazarus killed them. My wife... my son. Danica and Nikola. He... We don't have to talk about it. I need you to do something for me. Do what? You and me, we need to fight back. Don't be stupid, Montana. There is no "we." You need to train me so we can take down Lazarus. You got the brains and the knowledge, but... I know how things work around here. You need me. You need me! Show me your best punch. What, just like that? Oh, fuck! Haven't you got any gloves? No, Montana, no gloves. No gymnasium. No punchbag. And for the love of all that is holy, stop cursing! Again. Again! Who teach you to punch like that? You have to try punch through target, hmm? Like this. Okay? Again. Again! Again! Again! From here on, there is no coming back. You understand? Strong! Now you go. Boom! Good, good. Start coming up with better ideas than gang killing. Attack me. If that was knife, your guts be on floor. Your heart. Your lung. ♪ Put your hands up ♪ ♪ Can I testify ♪ Again. Can we listen to something else? No. This stuff is depressing. It's a bit like your cooking. Your generation is Internet, iPod, iTunes. What do you know about iTunes? Your generation is able to listen to the greatest music ever created like that. And what you choose? Fantasies of prostitution and death. All day long I'm going to blow your ass and make you dead. Don't mess with me. I put bullet in your head. That's a nice flow there, D. Keep it coming. But, listen, don't ever offer to blow anyone's ass. What? How do you know all of the stuff? The shooting and fighting. And how to, like... you know. Years ago, I was assassin. I did whatever I was ordered to do. Strike quietly. Kill quickly. Then, later, civil war came to my home. I followed my orders as always, but I discovered that many of my commanders, many of my fellow soldiers were corrupt men. Men without honor, without mercy. And I would not stand with these men as their comrade. But I could not stand against them as their enemy. We were brothers. And I had my family to think about. Danica and Nik... Ni-Nikola. So I... I tried to take them to safety. We traveled with the refugees for the border, but they were attacked by para-miltaries. Men with the weapons of soldiers, but hearts... Gangsters. And these men were commanded by Ratko. He didn't care if you were friend or enemy. He... He... He murdered them. I... I escaped. I break free. But not in time to save them. Ah, I... No. No. No. Shit. Can I ask you something, Montana? Please. Do not curse. I ask you as your friend, your comrade in battle. Sure thing, D. Anything you say. Thank you. What's wrong with this dozy prick? Who the fuck are you? What's with all the new faces? Reinforcements. What's wrong with our boys? They keep dying. Tell me what I want to hear. We spoke to Phelps. He said he's got everyone out there looking for who killed Cal and Isaac. What about Montana? If police get to him first... That's why we're paying Phelps, isn't it? You think I trust that bastard son of bitch? Kid knows everything. I want him found and killed and then I want his body brought here when it's done You understand? ♪♪ Stop it! No, no! Please! Give me your fucking hand! - Hold still! - No! Check. Send. Again. Send. Concentrate, Montana. What did I tell you, huh? Adjust for elevation and wind. This is reality. Is no computer game. Calm down, D. You got to check out the bigger picture. What? It's cool, huh? Yes, yes, very funny. Okay, funny guy, pack up. So what are you going to do after this, D? What are you going to do? What I'd like to do is stay with you. You should go to school. School's for losers. I can only teach you about death. School will teach you about life. Yeah? Learn about literature, mathematics. I can read and add up, D. You learn about science, history. You learn how to live with other people. What's so good about other people? What do you mean? I'm just some kid that grew up with crooks most of my life. Normal kids don't want nothing to do with me. Listen to me, Montana. You're a good kid. You're worth much more than what those men tried to make you. I guess so. Come, eh? Let's go. Delivery, sir. Might want this. Anything new? Is something the matter? It's nothing a cup of tea and a blow job couldn't sort out. How the fuck they get past the front desk? Maybe we're not the only bent bastards in the nick. What are we going to do? Do you want us to take him down? - What, Slavko? - Yeah. No. I don't think that's a war that even we could win. Right now, I've got something else in mind. No! No! Jess. Jess, Jess! Jess, look. What do you want, Montana? I just want someone to talk to. You're a drug dealer, aren't you? You got it all wrong. I'm not just a dealer. You work with dealers then? I don't work for them. They're... They're my fam. It's more complicated than that. No. It's simple. People like you are the reason why my sister is a... an addict. Right now, Montana, I don't need people like you in my life. I'm not who I used to be. Things have changed. Changed? How? I can't say. What a surprise. Just go. Hello, gorgeous. What the fuck do you feed him? Rottweilers? Shut your fucking mouth. Before you waste my time with lies, I know why you're here. Yeah. I can't operate at the moment with the bug... Speak once more and I will have Brako drown you! The boy lives. Why? He has no family, nowhere to go, and still you fail to find him and kill him. Continue to fail and you'll have bigger problem than Slavko. And I promise you I will cut off more than just your hand. Where have you been? Out. - You should have told me. - What would you have said? It was stupid risk, Montana. - Do not disobey me again. - Or what? - Don't be childish. - No, I'm serious. Or what? If you want me gone, just say so. And as for me being childish, half the time you're telling me to grow up. Half the time I can't even mess about without getting grief. And as you ask, I went to see Jess. No, no one saw me, and no, I didn't tell her nothing about you. She thinks I'm a dickhead. Happy? Montana. Don't bother asking me what's wrong. You understand? Why you go and see Jess? I just wanted someone to talk to. You could've talked to me. I'm scared, D. I don't want to die. You're never scared. You won't understand. Okay. It's okay. Easy. Easy now. Now what? Aah! What the fuck? Don't be baby. It was nowhere near you. Now this time... No, no, there is no this time! Then you'll never be ready. Fuck that, D! No! That shit's crazy! You're scared, hmm? You'll be useless in battle. Did you soil yourself? - No. - Control your fear. In battle, your mind must be clear at all times. If not, you endanger not only yourself, but your comrades also. Do you understand? Mm-hmm. This needs to be seriously fucking clever. You took your time. What'd you do? Stop and give each other a wank? Yeah, only after we got bored of spit-roasting your mum. Charming. That's the pleasantries out of the way. So why the fuck are we here? Montana's got a girlfriend. Lives up there. Number 13 And you want us to go in with badges? Well, I thought that'd be easier than the alternatives, innit? Yeah, easier... and more expensive Come on, man. We gave you a wedge the other day. Double or fuck off And there's me thinking you weren't just another chimp. Soon as you grow a pair and want to make some real money, let me know. Knock off Lazarus, take over with us watching your back. A hundred grand's going to feel like a piss in the ocean. A hundred grand this time tomorrow. Talk about the rest. When you've separate your head from your ass. We have a deal? Yeah. We got a deal. Right. You two stay here, see if we can get this done nice and quiet. After all, it's what you're paying us for. I hate that fucking faggot. Yeah, well, we need to hold it down, yeah? When we do Lazarus, we're gonna need him. Yeah? Listen, it's about time you stop bending over every time him and his faggot mate get a hard on. Is this the residence of Miss Jess Reardon? Yeah. What's she done? Can we come in? Come on, love. Don't act like you ain't had a visit from the police before. That's better. Where's Jess? Jess! What is it? They, um... They want a word about some bloke. Jess. Can I call you Jess? We're looking for a young man named Montana. Do you know him? Yeah. Do you know where he is? No. I just see him about, that's all. That's all? Guess who. So when do we hit Lazarus? He knows something's up, and we got the crew ready to roll. I'm telling you now, we need more guys, bruv. We're only going to get one shot at this, bruv. We have to make sure we do it right. Right. Well, you'll have to come to the station with us. What the fuck for? - She said she don't know him. - Step back! You've got to come with us. It's all right. Can I go and get my jacket? Yeah. Go on. It's not right. I'm warning you. One more fucking word... Yeah. How's that for doing it right, eh? Don't fight it, eh? Yeah. What's going on? Who are you? Calm down. I want to see some fucking badges right now! Go on, show me! - Stay still. - We'll see. Don't make me, bitch. What are you wearing? Hmm? It's my wedding suit. Rather you than me, D. Dimitrije, what was your son like? He was good kid. He was like you. Now, you ready? Never felt better. Remember, we are two against many. We must divide our enemy. Attack where he is weak and least expects. Only when we have created confusion and chaos... will we strike. Lazerus will not panic easily. Like all cowards, he will respond with force, with strength, with brutality. Do not be afraid. Keep moving. Stay in control. You will feel remorse when you kill your enemy. Do not linger on it.
