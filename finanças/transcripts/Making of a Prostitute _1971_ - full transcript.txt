(MAKING OF A PROSTITUTE) I have cigarettes. Oh, where did you get those? I found them outside. Lazy little beast, you put them up again, huh? She didn't do anything. Scrub. Scrub it! Come on, get in. Hurry. Hey! Sit down. Shitty sausage. Here. More. Nothing to eat, huh? What's your name? Sophie. Where do you live? You can come with me. Have you ever? How old are you? Soon fifteen. Run off. Protectory, huh? And your parents? Hey, what are you doing? Give me your notebook. Yes, all right. Here. Your mother wrote to you. A postcard from the workhouse. You can keep it and mark the mistakes. Tell me, why are you crying? This is the first time your mother has written to you. Be happy about it. You... still have that broker. - Can I have his number? - How much? - Ten percent? - Ha! Go. All right, fifty-fifty. Come. The deal is perfect. Gosh, you're freezing. Come on, we buy you some clothes. This is all crap, man! Don't be so shitty for once! Look, up there. You're great. It's a really bad situation, you know. I think we've spend too much. Nothing left to eat. I have a guy on hand, a broker, he pays well. You don't need to lift a finger. He does everything himself. Come on! You only need to dance. We'll try it. That's enough for the first time. Shit! Come on! I'm so cold. Not now! Come on, get started! Quiet over there! I want to sleep! Is that her? Here. The rest comes afterwards, you know. Come. Move, get in. Looking at you like that... I almost think the fellow is trying to trick me. Close the door. Let's have a drink first. Here, you too. Quite cozy from now on, all right? Come on. Get started. Come here. You don't have to be scared. I know how to pick up women. Come here! You stupid... No! Clean up and get dressed. I'm done now. What a wonderful life. Where is the money? Do you think the food and the clothes and the booth is for free? Very good. Well, that's what I said. As agreed. 30 bucks for each stitch. I don't care what you get. Okay. Let's try. You don't mind. You also pay 30, then you can try. Got it? All right. Crazy! Not here! Now it's vacation, understand? Good. Then tonight. Well, does it still hurt? Don't be pathetic. We need money, we have to live after all. Get in the water. Don't! No! To the back. Sit down. I stay outside and count, do you understand? Yes, yes, I don't cheat. I'll get the others. Clean yourself. You have to play along a bit, the faster they'll finish. I stay in front of the door. If someone takes advantage of you, then you cough. Then I'll kick him out. Well, if he comes and he likes it again, you know? Come on, button up, they're coming! Beer! Ciao. Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream. Where's the money? Yes, the money... I have it. 30 bucks each. You said I only had to do it occasionally. "Cause we're going to get married with the money, or something. Another double shot! I have always wanted. With the boy I'm dating with. I like him all alone. Well, he should have me all to himself and not share me with others. I... I don't have any. - Fifty-fifty. - Leave him. I have a better idea. I buy from him, then he pays you. Fine with me. Five hundred. Huh? Thousand. Nothing goes under a thousand. Look at her! She's great. I tell you, she does everything. Five hundred. Then seven hundred. Five hundred. Or him. Come. Come. Change of scenery, understand? - Good evening. - Room 51. Thank you. Hello, baby. Hello, beautiful lady. Where do you go? Won't you come with me? I live right here, next street. Won't you come with me? That's all. Do you think I would cheat? I can't do it any longer. You're smoking too much. I... I have syphilis. Keep going. I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow, then you get an injection, today it doesn't matter. Clients all have doctors. You're pretty stupid. Go somewhere else. Then they rat me out to the cops. - For you. - Hello. How much? One hundred. Crazy. When I say a hundred, they waltz off. Gee, you little whore, don't be so cold. For a hundred you have to show some heat. Jesus, if I were your age again, I would do something completely different. So, my dear, your game is up now. Here. I'm from civil protection. I work with the police. We take care of the playgrounds. I'm after sex offenders and hookers, and now you're convicted. That you're going on the hustle, and that must be registered. I'm going to take you to vice now. However, there is another option. I can let you go when we make out. I'll give you money. Not for hundred, fifty. No, fourty. Fourty is enough. Here, I picked up the little one. She was about to walk the streets. He's lying, he wanted to give me 40 marks. He's well known. He always drags in people like you. You take care of her, I rely on you. Asshole. - Surname? - Schulz. - Forename? - Sophie. Age? Twenty-one. ID. Thirteen. Yes, of course. But I'm all alone. I can't wake him up, he just walked in. Sit down. The old man is coming. Someone got run over. Where are you going? Genoa. Would you take me with you? Do you have a passport? You can't get over there without passport. They'll catch you at the border, then they'll send you back. That one is going to Frankfurt. Hey, Zanke, come over here! Yes? What's up? Come over here! Well, she's looking for a groom. How about you? Fine with me, you can get in. All right, have a good trip. See ya. Well, off to the honeymoon. Are you crazy? Out of your mind? I almost ran into you guys! Guys like you shouldn't be allowed to walk around freely! Come on, beat it! Let my sister go, she's underage! That's not true, he's lying! I don't know this guy! Come on, do it, or we call the cops. Come on, get out! We go home! Get out! - There I'll show you some manners! - No, leave me alone! Come on, have a nice trip. Get the suitcase. No! No, I don't want to go to mother! No, I don't want to! No! No. What do you want? No! No! Don't! Poor baby, what did they do to you? We'll get you clean. Well... Now... Come on, you have to get out of here. Come. No. I don't wanna leave! Shit! They'll let you rot in here, come on! Those pigs. Don't hurt it. Here... What do you want? Is Sophie here? No. Where is Sophie? Where is she? Tuto, you pig! Sophie? Don't be afraid, Sophie. Your friend told us everything. We help you. My name is Klaus Petry, I belong to group 12. If you want, I'll take you to one of our residential communities. There's quite a few girls just like you. You come from a protectory. Then they sent you out onto the street and blackmailed you. They do this to all the girls who have run away and were catched by them. Wanna do something for us? Not like you think now. You can do an apprenticeship. Or help in a kindergarten, or in a printing shop. Well, what do you think? We'll fix the protectory problem. Come, let's go. I'm sure you'll like it. No, no. Let them do it themselves, they can do it. Now you know why I have short hair. It would be safer if you put the girls with families out of town. Then we can leave it alone. In these families, they are only used for cleaning but they do not learn anything. I think we have to give them the opportunity to develop further, otherwise they end up where they came from. The only absurd thing is that we always have to run away from the police with our actions. Then change the Youth Protection Act and the police will work for you. Oh, stay factual! - Where have you parked? - Over there. All right, get in. Guys, what's the nonsense? Are you crazy? Come on, let's go. Do you have shit for brains? What do you want from me? Come on, hit the pedal! What's going on? Dude... Leave me alone! - Kick them out! - Hold on to me! Give me your hand! Come on! I can't! The girl! Let go! - Come here! - Leave me alone! Throw out the pimps! - The cops are coming! - Hold her! - Take him! - Leave me alone! I have him! I have him! Here, hold! Hold him! ID check! Can't you think of anything more stupid? Stop these innuendoes, will you? Who are you? Klaus Petry. Here, one of these guys threatened me with a gun, and outside they beat up a friend of mine. You're coming with us. Anyone who can't identify themselves comes along! You're lucky your friend got in touch right away and we got you out of it. Cigarette? In any case, I can reassure you that conditions in our city are quite normal. You call that normal? Certainly, at your age, I'm glad that you want to change something. We need people like you. Our democracy... To hell with your democracy! You can believe me, and this is by no means meant to be directed at you, but we have less trouble with the pimps than with the students. Please don't be mad at me if I say something like that at all, but that too has to be said once. It is your illegal organizations, after all, that aim to withdraw pupils from institutions. You must have understood, on this point... We have our rules. No. No, I didn't want to say that this time. On this point, we just have to stick to our guns. There's nothing to liberalize there. Where are we going if we let everyone mess with our state parenting? Fine parenting that allows people to make slaves out of others! Besides, the pimps couldn't send them out on the streets unless you and your friends got them out of the protectories first. That's an assumption! We deal with it every day. We know all about it. You can't send someone out on the street who doesn't want it. Any further discussion is useless here! But I guarantee you one thing: If no way can be found and these girls have to go back to the protectory, really, I'll get them out with my friends. And if necessary, by force.
