The Second World War ended a long time ago, its kind so unlike any horrifying dream experienced by man. Countless people were carried off, young and old, men and women, soldier and civilian, American and German, French and British, Japanese and Filipino, Jew and Christian. But the brunt of agony and misery visited upon the world was without measure. This is one such piercing portrait - of those whose lives were caught in the war here in the Philippines to serve as a reminder of a horrifying past and as an admonition for the future because what is important is to portray reality and etch in the minds of everyone what happened in that span of three years when man was abandoned by God. In the beginning, man and the world were created. Love was what reigned, love of the Creator. Love was king, love that was noble. Born and came to stay was one great madness. In the West, bullets had the laughter of song. And in the blood, they gamboled with impunity In the East, slowly the sun faded, waving whispering and smiling was darkness. Madness is the reason. Madness is the reason. For three years, our God will disappear. Three years. November, 1941 In a town in Laguna Good afternoon, Sir! Have you seen Rosario? Did you look in her room? - Yes I did. She must be there in the garden. Thanks! I'll go look. Rosario! What's wrong? Are you leaving? Yes. I'll pray for you. Thank you. Well, I have to go. Mother, do you think Japan will really invade us? You're a teacher and you don't know it? They would be running into a wall. What can Japan do against the US? It's too big and powerful. Don't worry. The Americans will take care of us, And God too, he won't abandon us. December 7, 1941 Oblivious to all, look how Death smiles. The Japanese! Bataan April 9, 1942 New Year, with shut eyes, look at this horror, Rosario! Rosario, aren't you coming with us? No, Menang. Father says life would be harder in the mountains. It's too dangerous here. The Japanese are already in town. And I was told they show no mercy to women especially to beautiful women. They rape women. And the news is they kill babies right in front of the church. They throw babies in the air and impale them on their bayonets. That's probably not true. Those are just rumors. If you don't believe me, it's going to be your funeral. God will show us mercy. In these times, there is no God. No one is up there. We always end up taking the brunt. Where are you going, Rosario? Crispin has returned. Where? Sion, come, Crispin has returned! Many died along the way from Maribeles, especially the weak, because of hunger and weariness, those with malaria and the wounded. They couldn't bear the long journey under the heat of the sun. I saw many being shot, pierced with bayonets, their skulls shattered, their guts slashed open, and left to die by the wayside like animals. We could do nothing but go on walking, look on, keep it all inside. It's good you escaped. A lot of us escaped. A few in our group were killed, but most of us escaped. Have you heard about McArthur? When is he coming back? Maybe it won't take long. The word is he is in Australia. That's where he is assembling troops to liberate us. I told you, the Americans won't forsake us. It's only Andoy who has little faith. Of course, they will give us protection. They are the only ones who can save us. If they are truly strong and powerful, why did they lose? How could they win? They were caught unawares. Crispin, what's wrong? Nothing, Rosa. I just needed some air. Forget everything. It's in the past. Crispin, you should rest here for a few days before leaving. Paete is far from here. The rest will do you good. That's what it's like, Rosario. What? Why don't you answer me? That's how it is to kill. I thought I couldn't do it. That's how it feels, when you see your enemies approaching, you aim your gun, but close your eyes. Even if your fingers are trembling, you will pull the trigger. When the gun goes off, you open your eyes, and see your enemy writhing in the throes, his body twisting in pain catching his breath then you see him slowly weakening, until he lies lifeless. At first, it will unnerve you, your body will grow numb, then you think about it. Then it will dawn on you how easy it is to kill, so that the next time you fire your gun, your eyes are wide open, aiming at the enemy. You are primed to kill. Crispin, stop thinking about it. Now that the fighting is over... - It's not, Rosario. What are you planning to do? I'll join the guerillas. For what? For what!? Do you want me to stand by while the Japanese kill us? Shoot us, bayonet us, disembowel us? I'll kill them, I'll kill them all. Sons of bitches, those sons of bitches! I'll kill them all, I'll kill them... There's only one thing I ask of you: help Crispin. Help him to dispel bad memories from his mind. Banish from his heart all the anger and bitterness he feels. Return him to his former innocence. If he goes back to the mountains don't forsake him. Give him the strength to face everything, and save him because he's a good man. I love him. The moon is bright. Mother is up there. She's not looking. She might see us. She won't come down here. Hush, Rosa. Nothing will happen to me. Goodbye. A lot of us will go. Be careful! - Yes! Where will you get new arms? We have collected quite a few. Please come back alive! Take care of yourself. If you pass by that town, I have relatives there. We have to go, sir. - Okay. Take care of yourself. Rest assured. Father, what's wrong? - Shh! May this war end without injury to any of us. Amen. Sweet potato, again! I've been farting from it all day. You imp. It's hard enough to dig them out. Eat! You should be thankful. Others have nothing to eat but grass. We are lost. Do you know the way to Santa Cruz? Santa Cruz? That's a long way from here. How did you end up here? Because, hombre, the man we asked gave us the wrong directions. Take this road going straight to town. When you reach the church, take a left. That's the road going to the highway. Are you sure? - Well, I'm not telling a lie. Do you have wine here? I'll pay for it. Yes, we have. What is this? Rice wine. - Strong? Almost pure alcohol. I like it. Give me more. That's the last of it. Otherwise, I'd give you more. Give me two glasses. I said, give me two drinking glasses! Francis, come here. It's too strong, chico. Don't stop me. Drink. When the bombs fell here the lanzones fruits all fell. In his fear, my uncle Daniel forgot about his wife. Clutching a piglet, he hid under a bed but with his backside exposed. It's all true. How is it you speak Tagalog so well? I was born here. Are you Filipino? No. - Where are you from? I'm from Manila. My father owned a big business there before the war. And this is Francis, my bosom buddy. He is a doctor. My constant companion wherever I go. He takes care of me. I know why you like my company so much. You love me... You're drunk, Masugi. Let's go. Let's finish this first. Finish it and leave! Yes we will, but first, give me a kiss. Father! Please don't! That's my daughter! Andoy, what's happening? Stay down! Hurry! Have pity on me. Don't! Don't! Francis, let's go. Andoy, find where Rosario is. She's here. Mother, help me! Don't leave me. Shameless brute! Don't come here. I will kill you. I will kill you. Animal, let me go. You're hurting me. Let me go! Let me go. I will let you go but stop hitting me. Wait! I brought you a dress. Are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid of anyone, let alone you. Please don't be angry. You can't blame me, you are beautiful and I was drunk, so I couldn't stop myself. Consider yourself lucky, a lot of girls find me handsome. Get away from here. I won't. If you won't leave, I'll report you in town. Don't tire yourself, our orders are to befriend the lot of you. What's your name? - That's none of your business. Do you have anything to eat? I'm hungry. Anything, I'll pay for it. We have nothing to eat here. We have almost nothing to eat here. Are you hungry? No, I'm not hungry. You know, I'm not a bad man. Don't worry, I'll bring you rice and canned food. Everything I can get camp, I'll bring to you. I don't need your gifts. I'll die first before accepting anything from you. We shall see. Mr. Masugi, you shouldn't have. This is too much. Please never tire of bringing us food. We don't need this. Why do you insist on giving. Rosario, no! Take all of this and leave. Leave. I won't accept anything from him. But we need this. It's been a while since we tasted such good food, especially this rice. Why do you insist on coming here? Why don't you leave us alone? What do your gifts mean? Why don't you answer? What do you need from us? What's happening, chico? What's happening to you? Why are you so quiet? Hey, Masugi - what are you thinking? None. Are you in love? Be careful with your slapping. You might hit your hand. Wait. Let me go. Wait, I need to talk to you. Go ahead, speak. I'm defenseless against you. Why are you that way? Why can't you be like your father and mother? Why? You ask me why? I'm pregnant! Don't touch me. Rosario, please forgive me already. You destroyed my life. I think not. Why? I'll make an honest woman of you. You? Why? I love you. On the sixth month, God commanded the angel Gabriel to a city of Galilea called Nazareth to a virgin called Mary betrothed to a man called Joseph Today's Gospel is... No! Help me! My son was shot! Everyone must stay here. Only women and children can leave. Hail Mary, full of grace the Lord is with you, blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb... Have you noticed something... Have you noticed something... Everyone will be given rice... all our Asian brothers... American culture should go. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Where did you find him? At the capitol. I looked for him. He is the only one who can help. Rosario. Forget about the past. Masugi is a good man. Any woman would be lucky to marry him. Not me. Forget about Crispin. He will never return. He is probably dead by now. That's why he's been gone for over a year. He is still alive. But we are ruled by Japan now. He can no longer come down from the mountains. The Americans will never return. Accept Masugi's offer. And that's what's right. That's the situation. Read the papers. Those who write in papers are traitors, paid by the Japanese. Why are you so angry with Masugi? Yes he forced you but he was drunk and didn't know what he was doing. And you are not the only woman who has been hurt. Your father, and I, did you hear a peep out of us? He should become a priest. What's wrong with that if he has repented? If you respect yourself you won't accept anyting from him. Don't say that! Your father and I were not the only ones who benefited from Masugi. Never have I touched anything coming from him. You are lying and you know it. Come ride now. Hey, don't disobey me. Ride, I said. Your father will come out on Sunday. God, you who listen to all our sorrows... listen to our supplications... ...grant him eternal peace... There's your father, children. Did they hurt you? No. Traitor! Traitor! Wife of a Japanese! Wife of a Japanese! Aren't you afraid? - Of what? Of the guerillas? You are all alone. No. I'm used to it. And I'm not afraid to die. Why do you love me? I don't know. All I know is I love you. Don't you know that I have a fiancee? I know, but if I were him I would never leave nor abandon you. Forget him. Please go. I'm going to bed. Leave, and never return. That's not possible. You are carrying my son. Your child? - Both of you and my child, wherever you go... Do you want a son? Yes, I'd like a son. I'd like to teach him to take his first steps and when he grows up, I'll teach him everything I know, To drive, to shoot and he will study in Tokyo. Perhaps when you see how I love our son you will learn to love me too. Leave now! - I'll bring Francis here to look at you. That's not necessary. - What if something happens to you? That's none of your business! I love you. Liar! Liar! You're a liar! You came just in time. Rosario is about to give birth! Come now, so you can see the child. Sion, you have a beautiful grandson. You're a grandmother now. And you, an uncle. Good thing he looks like me. - What do you mean? Look at his eyebrows and the shape of his nose -- it's all me. There you go again. We should think of a good name. Look no further. How about my grandfather's name, Andres? Andres? That stinks. I want the name of a blue blood. Why don't you give him a chance? This is the first in a long while that I've seen him so happy, since his parents died. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and they put the Japanese in jail, Masugi escaped and ran to me for help. I hid him. I did all I could to spring his parents out of jail. To no avail. I just learned one day of their deaths. They were killed by inmates at the jail. They were killed by Filipinos. From that day, Masugi changed. He collaborated with the Japanese. He would often tell me, in war, one should never think, one should never fear god. One should never be human. Only an animal lives long. But since he met you, he has changed. He is returning to his old self. He needs you, Rosario. He needs your love. Is it good? What is hurting? I love you. Is it good? What is hurting? I love you. Have you seen her? Thank you! Thank you! Let's go home. Rosario, take the child inside before it gets damp. Mother, it's Crispin. Please open the door. Don't be afraid. Your mother told me everything. Don't blame me. No. I can't do that. I didn't want you to know, so I didn't send word to Paete. I know you would've taken revenge. I don't want you to die. That's how I feel now. Was it difficult for you? What do you mean? Giving birth? Yes. Where is he? In Santa Cruz. That's where he is posted. When is your wedding? This Sunday. Do you love him? Yes! Yes, Father! In an abandoned house in town Who are you? Mother! Please don't. Let me go. Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us. We aren't collaborators. We didn't do anything wrong. Have mercy on us. We didn't do you wrong. Andoy, my husband. Mother! Go inside. Who's there? What are you doing here? Leave, Crispin, while I can control myself. We had nothing to do with the death of your parents. I had nothing to do with it. How do I know? You could have ordered it out of revenge. You think so little of me. So who could it have been? Who killed them? Who shot at us today? Isn't it people like you? People who proclaim yourselves heroes? Freedom fighters? You are worse than the Japanese because you kill your own kind. You are worse than animals once you get hold of guns. Masugi, Crispin is here. Masugi, he needs medicine. What medicine? Crispin, this is Masugi. You can't stay here. When you're well enough, you have to go. Wait. Aren't you afraid? Should I? Why didn't you kill me? Do you need to ask that? I didn't know you Japanese have souls too. Go ahead, shoot! You speak as if you don't kill. We are all the same. No. I kill because I'm fighting for our country. Country? Do you know what you are talking about? You are killing on behalf of Americans. What's wrong with that? They will give us true independence. Not like you. No matter how many governments you put up here we will never recognize you. Because all of your supporters are collaborators. What do you call people who sell their country to America? America is not the enemy. Do you think America is any different from Japan? They are one and the same. Because war is for the rich alone. Yes, like Japan, the Americans will give the independence they promised. But they won't let go of this country. They need it to control Asia. If you want independence, fight for your own country. And the time is now. If that's what you believe in, why still fight for the Japanese? Do I have a choice? - Yes, join us. Do you think I will join the same people who killed my parents? My mother was Filipina, but they killed her just the same. I no longer saw my parents' corpses because I had to hide. Because had they found me they would've kill me. Now you ask me to help you? Count yourself lucky, for knowing Rosario. Salome, what's taking so long? Where's the milk? The Americans have returned! It's the Americans! We are being bombed! October, 1944 Don't be afraid, youngest child, Red night will come to an end. Where is that? - Manila, bombed by the Americans. March, 1945 Where do I put the pot? Lug it along. Think for yourself, will you? Let's go. Rosario, take the child. Quick! A truck's arriving! Go to sleep. Rosario, you should go down to town tomorrow. Bring our child. And you? I will go up to Mount Banahaw. The rest of us are there. I can't leave you. What if they find us out? They won't, as long as we stay here. Until when? Who's there? Who's there? We need to get away from here. When I say the word, run. How about you? I can take care of myself. Duck. Run! Let me go. I don't want to live anymore. You can't stay here. The guerillas are in town to welcome the Americans tomorrow. You should go. Where do I go? Why not go to Crispin? He loves you, he won't abandon you. Tonight, I will accompany you, we will go to Paete. I'm afraid. Why don't you pray? So you stopped praying a long time ago. Is this how it is, when a man loses all hope, and has nowhere to run that's only when he seeks you and asks for mercy. I pray to you not for my sake but for my son's. This prayer is for him, and if you God exist, I beg you to listen. How can this be? Three years, is there no God? No, Crispin. Look at them. The man became blind because of the war. His brother was rendered lame. Why are they here? Ask yourself: What are they doing here? God did not abandon us. There is proof, like the two of them. Like the three of you: Rosario, Masugi, and you. For the last three years, love lived in your hearts. And that's what gives all of us the strength to live. In the beginning, man and the world were created. Love was what reigned. Love of the Creator. Love was what reigned. Love that was noble. This anger of war in the heart, scatter it.. Love, in the hearts of the innocent, take root. Those without mercy, their bitterness grows even more fierce. And in the end the red sun in the east faded. Love is king, love is king. Three years, and our God has returned. Three years.
