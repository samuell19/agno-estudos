WOMAN DESPISER Such a terrible night, it gives me the creeps. Hurry up, run home. Two women were killed in one week, . . I'm afraid I could be next. - Stay with us if you like. - No, mum will be worried. Goodnight. - Good morning, is Leman up? - I don't know, She came in at midnight. We'll be late, let's wake her up. Leman... Leman... She's been afraid lately. She must have locked. Leman... Leman... I was afraid on my way home, too. Leman... Leman... Here's the key. She was murdered. Go to Laga with your team, to this address. Another woman was murdered. Same way of killing as with the other murders. We're dealing with a sex maniac. We can call him a necrophile as well. Do the doctors agree, Commissioner? The first victim is said to have died of fear. Then she was raped after death. There's evidence of sadism, too.. There's evidence of abuse on the corpse. The woman's friend was arrested. Give him a hard interrogation. In my opinion, he's after happy women. In that case, he must have no lover. Or, he's been cheated on. It makes no sense. Nobody has even seen him. All we know is he uses gloves. Just a minute Commissioner, I think I got something. The first murder took place in Maltepe. - Her name was Melek. - Yes. The second one, in Erenkioy. And her name was Emine. So, Emine was killed in Erenkioy, and Melek in Maltepe. And Leman in Laga. This can't be just a coincidence, Commissioner. The initials of the districts and the initials of the victims can't accidentally be the same. The killer, either signs with acrostics or he's sending us a message. We can't anticipate one crime for each district. He may be an acrostic freak. One of those who write lines... with their lover's initials? Something like that. Send Emini to the girl's house and tell him to interrogate her acquaintences. Yes, Sir. Kemal, you interrogate the first victim's lover, again. Let's see if he writes poems. - I asked you where you were that night! - I was playing poker with friends. - What time did you leave? - I can't remember. - You must try. - Was it 11:00? - Later.. - What time? I don't know.. - What did you do after that? - I walked around. - With whom? - Were you alone? Were you with a girl? Were you alone? Yes, I was alone. Leman's friends say you quarreled. - Is that true? - Yes. - Why? - Personal reasons. Are these reasons more important than your life? Partly, yes. - How so? - I can't tell you. I can't tell you. Don't push me. You're being foolish, confess for your own good. Cut the crap. Don't you understand? Yes. Then talk, answer us! She used to be mad at me because I hung around with women. We weren't married yet... and I was 28 years old. We couldn't get married.. She didn't understand I had certain needs. She wouldn't understand. You killed her because you were pissed off? And then you raped her. No, no, no... - I was with another woman. - What's her name? I don't know, I met her in the street and we went to a hotel. - Which hotel? - Bosporus, Deniz Hotel. - You have a rich father. - Right. - Cars are your hobby. - Yes. - You write poems too? - I hate poetry. - Think again. - Think what? I'm asking, do you write poems? No, no poems nor stories. That's enough.. I'm tired of interrogations every time you find a woman murdered. Give him a cigarette. You like harassing people? - Sometimes. - What about killing? Don't touch me. I didn't kill her.. I didn't kill her.. I didn't kill her.. But as it is... I can be a murderer... or a poet... - Do you like poetry? - No, I'm not the poet type. - I prefer art. - Me too. Gaugin and Van Gogh are my favourite ones. - I didn't know you had a guest. - I'm not a guest, madam. After that horrible night you've been our best friend, Mr. Kemal. Do you think of getting married again? He can't find a woman like Melek. Indeed. - Some brandy? - No, thank you. I don't drink, either. My mother doesn't allow it. My mother says that my brother died due to heavy drinking. The killer struck again. Did you read about it? You're here Mr. Kemal? Yes. Sadly, another girl, called Leman, was murdered. Each time, my son gets so upset. Don't remind me, please. Excuse me, I'm not feeling well. Just a minute, guys. Don't you get depressed here, Oya? All my childhood memories are here, Kemal. My husband drank a lot, but he didn't die from drinking. He was driving drunk and he died in a car accident. His mother, I mean my mum, says drinking cost his life, but I don't agree. - How come? - We had a quarrel. Why? He was jealous of me, even about his brother. Until he got engaged. Was he jealous for some reason? Kenan appreciated me a lot. - Why did you come to the mansion? - To see you. - What else? - To have a walk together. - What else? - What could it be? I can see you're still suspicious of Kenan. That's our job, to suspect everybody till we find the murderer. - Do you suspect me, too? - Yes. Could I possibly be the killer? If you reject my marriage proposal, you'll be my murderer. - You really scared me. - Why? It's good to be with a policeman, but not under his supervision. Doesn't that weird house hurt you, Oya? I went there as a child. After my parents' death. Kenan's mother was my mother's cousin. They loved me like their kids with no discrimination. Later, I became her son's wife. When I was a pupil at school they called me "the adopted one" This was the only thing that hurt me in this family. This mansion still looks weird to me. If Kenan's fiancee hadn't been killed and I hadn't gone there, I wouldn't have met you. Some people's grief can be anothers' happiness. Life's so strange. Kenan's fiancee is murdered, you come to interrogate, we meet and my life changes. Then, I understand there's life outside the mansion as well. I've been a widow for 3 years. Believe me, I never thought I'd get married again. Me too... after my wife's death I didn't think of getting married again. Everything has changed since I met you. Why don't we go for a movie? - I don't like them. - How about some dancing? After 3 years, I've forgotten how to dance. I'll teach you. Let's go to a night club, first thing. Don't be afraid, darling. Don't be afraid, darling. No reason to be. . It's only a show. The man is a dummy and the sword is fake. - If you're upset we can go. - Yes, we better go. I didn't like that show Kemal. It teaches us that women kill indifferent men, no matter how much they love them. That's silly. How do you explain she wants him after his death? So, a man running after a woman, is brainless. Is that the way you see it? A man running after a woman, is brainless? No, you misunderstood. This doesn't apply to us. I'm only joking. Shall we dance? If you want we go to my place, it's warm too. No, it's too late. Don't, someone can see us. Let everybody see us, I want you so much. Someone passed by, they sure saw us. So what? - Thank you for this night. - Thank you, too. I'd come to your house if it wasn't late. It's too late, go. I'm afraid of the man I saw. But why are you scared? I'll come in and make love to you. - It's late, no. - Just a little, please. Please go, because I want you, too. What if the monster is inside? Don't scare me, for the love of God. Don't be afraid, I was joking. Ayse, my daughter, is that you? Yes father. It's late, go to bed. I'm going father. Goodnight Sir. One more kiss and I'll go. Didn't your father hear me? He's angry because we're late, so he's not replying. - Can you give me the anatomy book? - One moment. You're sending me away too early, I got your house key. I come again if I want. So you don't know? But they saw you in front of her door. And you're saying you don't know. I don't know how it happened. If I knew who did it I'd kill him with my teeth. And you know there's a monster that got your fourth victim? - Who do you think it is? - How should I know... The murder took place just after you left. It happened 4 minutes after you were seen at her house. - So? - You were the last one who saw her. The killer is the one who sees the victim for the last time. - So, you killed her. - Why did you kill her? I didn't kill her. - You were jealous, right? - No! - Where is the knife? - I don't know. - You don't know what? - The knife. How do you know she was killed with a knife? You said so! - No, we didn't. - You did. Enough! That's enough! I didn't kill her. You went to her house together, and in 4 minutes she's found dead and raped. On her clothes they find your fingerprints. And now, you're telling us you got nothing to do with the murder. - How did you kill her? - Confess! - Say that you killed her. - I'm not a murderer, I'm not! This time you were taken unawares. You thought her father didn't see you. - You didn't figure things out. - Yeah, you didn't. You killed all of them. Don't deny it, you were the last one who saw her. Say "yes" and save yourself. That'll be your salvation. You're certainly crazy. If you weren't crazy you woudn't kill that way. - You are the murderer. - You are the murderer! - You are the murderer! - Confess. - Confess! - Speak up. - Talk, talk! - Can't you hear? Enough, enough, I'm not the killer! I'm not the killer! Let him stay here till he confesses. Come with me Kemal. Start talking, boy. The victim's name was Ayse and the district is Aksaray. That's not a coincidence. But we got no clue on what he looks like. - The guy kills whoever he wants. - That's why we're afraid. I think this one is not the killer either. That's what I think too. I suspect everybody. - Myself, you... - Me too. - Mr. Kemal, telephone. - Excuse me.. - Hello, Kemal speaking. - Kemal, is that you? I'll come to you in the evening. It'll be a pleasure to come and pick you up. I told my folks I'll go to a friend in Kadikioy. If they find out we'll be together, they won't let me. I'll be so glad to see you in my house. - I hope the same goes for you. - I love you very much, Kemal. - Say it again. - What? Say it again? Ok. I love you very much. Who were you talking with, Oya? With my friend in Kadikioy, she's waiting for me. - Do I know her? - Of course you do, it's Zale. We're having guests tonight, how will you go? It's a shame. But I gave my word mother. I see you forgot your mourning. But mother... ...I can't die along with the deceased. It's been 3 years since he died. Three years? Three years, then? Seems like yesterday to me. It's been 3 whole years, and I think I buried him yesterday. Don't cry mother. Please, don't cry! I loved him too, I think I still do. When I lost him I thought my world fell apart. Sadly, life goes on. With its good side, and bad. We're living between life and death. Benan was your son, but he was also my husband. He was mother, father and brother to me. But life goes on. At first, days hardly went by. Later, I realised that we were all buried alive in here. I was in the garden one morning... ...I saw a little bird lying down. Its mother picked it up. There was a cat between us I tried to save it, but the cat snatched it. I saw the mother's suffering. But death, too, is one of God's commandments. The bird's mother was singing woefully on the tree. Even for her, life goes on. She had to return to her little ones who were waiting for her. Enough, that's enough! Your daughter-in-law is right, mother. Like the bird of our nest, you must embrace us with your wings. Let's say that our bride, due to mourning, hasn't been to the cinema, nor some party. I haven't lived like a man, either. You too, mother. Our lives were meaningless after my brother's death, and then, my fiancee's murder. If you want, we can go to a night club tonight. I'd love to but I'm invited. Some other night then. - Won't you feel ashamed? - For what reason? - What will those who see you think? - What will they say? What will they say. . You see what happens to the girls who walk around alone. We all know what happens to those who walk around alone. Excuse me. Do you know where Kemal's house is? - The policeman? - Yes. - Third house on the right. - Thank you. I got so scared while on my way here. I thought someone was following me. I kept hearing footsteps. And I bumped into a man. He stared at me curiously. Where was that? Two streets away. Next to the avenue. This is a remote area. Too bad I didn't bring you here. Nejla, Nejla. Sis, this is Oya. How do you do? Will you offer us a drink, Kemal? With pleasure. But no gossip about me please. Are you in love with my brother? He's so nice, I want him to be happy. His wife had a peculiar death. They married for love but they weren't happy. What do you have, hemiplegia or rheumatism? You're very curious. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - Partly hemiplegia. Pardon? If you suffered like me, then you would understand. Kemal's wife didn't like me. She believed I was sitting in the wheelchair on purpose. She said I was strong in my legs and my body. She was jealous of my brother and saw me as her mother-in-law. My brother believed the same thing. - What are you saying this time? - I'm talking about you, what's wrong? Excuse me, please go on. Better not bother you with my problems. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. What happened, did she really hurt you? Never mind, she won't be staying with us. First my mother and then my wife suffered a lot with her. I told you I don't love her because she turned our life into hell. During our first week of marriage she feigned illness. She has never walked since. But she wouldn't want to live in a wheelchair. She says she can't walk. She never leaves that wheelchair. But I don't believe she's invalid. You're so cruel. Didn't you go to some doctor? She doesn't even want to talk about it. There may be nothing wrong with her legs, as my wife said. She may be really invalid, but I doubt it. Why would she do this? In order to apply psychological pressure upon people and avoid staying home alone. When I told her I'll get married and live in another house, she requested to see you. I couldn't refuse. You did the right thing, darling. Look at me, am I ugly? Horrible, horrible!!! At my window. It was so horrible. Such a thing! - It was like a gorilla. - Didn't you see anything else, Nejla? - Please, don't cry. - By God, it was a monster. Eyes were purple. Like an orang-outang, like a gorilla.. - Drink some water. - It'll make you feel better. We're in Harbie, therefore the killer... wants to kill some woman with the name Hahirye. I guess he came here by mistake. Before us, Mrs Hahirye lived here, right? They left a month ago. Where have you been, Oya? I told you I'd go to a friend's. I hope you know what happens to those who walk around alone at nights. Probably. But the ones staying home are in danger of getting murdered, too. You like the policeman, don't you? Yes madam. Will you marry him? Would you allow me to? You're my husband's mother, therefore mine too. So I'm asking for your permission. That's right, Oya. - I see you as my mother. - That's true as well. "Marriage permission" sounds strange, doesn't it? You've forgotten my son, haven't you, Oya? Three years... It's been three years mother. Lots of things have changed in three years. Things are happening, mother. - But my son adored you. - So did I. - If I had died... - He wouldn't get married again. - Did you tell Kenan? - No. - I think he'll be upset too. - I don't think so. Necrophilia... intercourse with corpses. Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... You don't have to speak dear cops. I'm home dear cops. Hello... Hello... Speak. Something wrong? Hello... Hello... Your eyes are beautiful, I can't get enough of them. - I don't believe you Ahmet. - Why? Because you say the same things to all ladies. How do you know? That's how you conquered Nalan. Don't bring up the past, Hadan. I was advised to avoid smooth lovers. But I'm content with you. My mother said widows have lots of enemies. I really love you, Hadan. - Fancy the young guy? - Come on Ahmet, you're being jealous. If you cheat on me, I'll kill you, Hadan. Look at me, you're driving me mad. Don't look at him I say! My hand hurts, let go. We'll be humiliated. I'll break your bones. You can't forbid my glance. Are you pissed off? I'm not afraid of being killed by you. Death by your hands will be sweet. Like you, I don't want to lose you, either. Will that be our own song, Ahmet? The song will tells our fate. The nicest fate. I won't die because I love you... I won't die because I live with you... I won't leave without you... Death for me will be waking up from the dream... Don't leave me... I'm yours... I don't like it Our fate smells of death. It's 1:30, let's go Hadan. It's a long way. We'll go up to Haligioglou. - Who can that be? - My brother perhaps? No, he left by train this morning. You go to bed, I'll open the door. What if he's back? - I don't think so. - Oh, it could be aunt Najie. She left her milk here. It's behind the door, give it to her. Hurry up. I'll be waiting in bed. Who was it Ahmet? No one. Come darling, the bed is so cold. Come on Ahmet, come on. Don't tickle me. Stop hiding, come out! You can't deny it anymore. The Public Prosecutor gave his verdict. Sumeyye Hadan was murdered in Haligioglu. And her friend was found dead next to your car. Still denying? - My car was stolen. - Tell me another. Look, your lover gets murdered, you say you're innocent. Your car is involved in two murders and you're pulling our legs. So far, we haven't pushed you to confess. With this evidence you can easily hang. I had reported my car theft, to the Traffic Police. They actually confirm this. Hmm, it is as you say. Since you reported the theft before the murder. First you reported the theft.. Then you did whatever you wanted. And finally abandoned it. - So tell us where you were that night. - In Bar Deniz. Ok, a card of that Club was found in Ahmet's pocket. The couple was there too, that night. I remember the woman. That's true. We have no doubts, right Chief? But when I got out I didn't find my car. I reported it. At the time of the crime I was talking with some police officers. Yes... yes sir. I see... The Lieutenant called, and he confirms what the suspect told us. There was a witness, too. They're coming here to testify. - Get him out of here. - Yes sir. - We're at a dead end again. - I think that's true. We have a few suspects. Kenan is the suspect for the first murder. And these are the suspects for the second murder. Sani and Ali. The third one, the fourth one... And this would be the fifth one if he wasn't murdered. In all, we have five suspects. First, we must get rid of suspicion. If there's a new crime, while the suspects are in detention... then this means we're on the wrong track. Yes, but with what excuse will we keep them in detention? Excuse me, but they're going to be our guests. I hope they will accept this, too. Better than being forever branded suspects. We'll get their consent. Let's try and see. Better share our tasks. My team will make sure we convince each and everyone of them. - Are you in love with the policeman? - Yes Kenan. - Will you get married? - God willing... - Remember the day you first came here? - With Kemal? Your own coming. I was just a child and you a young girl. I loved you so much then. I was happy you were going to stay with us. Till you got married. I was enchanted by your beauty. I also loved you all, very much. Your mother became mine too. You brought us happiness. I was just starting to paint. You taught me how to love good and beautiful things. Remember my brother's coming, as well? He was very cheerful, unlike me. You may still love him. He had a vivid, as well as romantic, life. He used to have an unforgettable fresh scent on him. Those who met him wanted to be around him. They called him, 'Sweet life child' What, what did you say? Sweet life child... Those were my words. I told them to him. How come you know them? Did Benan tell you? One night, your room door was left open. Were you watching us? Were you eavesdropping? No, I just overheard what you told him. From then on, I became a Sweet life child, as well. Don't be mad at me, but by the time my brother came you paid attention to me. When he stepped in, I lost you. What do you mean? - I loved you, too. - As your sister. - I don't know, maybe. - Don't talk nonsense. I don't. I was a child then. A child, whose toy was taken away. - I see. - No, you don't. Tell me then. I trusted you more than my mother. I don't forget your assistance when I was engaged to Melek. I loved her a lot, too. She was my life. Or so I thought. Melek's death finished you, Kenan. So, will I lose the persons I love? First I lost you, and then Melek. Excuse me, am I bothering? Please, come in. Me and Oya remembered the past. Our happy days. Me, on the other hand, I'm not thinking of the past, but the current concerns. - Again? - Sadly. Two persons were killed. Two girls? No, a woman and her friend. We can't do anything. We decided to detain the ones close to the victims. - Kenan too? - I'm afraid yes. This will be with his own consent. He'll be our guest in the Station for a while so that we don't bother him after each crime. He won't be a suspect anymore, in case of a new murder while he is in detention. Let's go then. I'd like to speak with my mother for a minute. Ok, ok, ok... You want me to be detained, or a guest, whatever it is, I'm coming. I'm fed up, every night you invade my dreams. Come on, let's go. This nonsense is out of the question. You can't take me anywhere. You interrogate me whenever you feel like it. This time it's not interrogation but hospitality. Please, be our guests instead. There are orders for the opposite. If I don't come... You'll be a permanent suspect and we'll keep interrogating you. Maybe so. Did the others accept? Yes, they may be at the Station already. Hey, hey, if only I had found you outside and you told me you killed Emine. Shut up, you killed Emine and the others! I wonder why you're not going to the scaffold. Be quiet, this is a Police Station! Mister policeman, by God, he killed Emine. Hey, come on! Didn't you say you were going to kill her because she hung out with me? I did, so what? I was joking. I didn't skewer her head like you did. Gentlemen, we're expecting one more. And we'll take care of your hospitality needs. Excuse us. See, the jail is in there. This is the waiting room. If you're really innocent, this will be a test. Everything's ok Mr. Kemal. Give this to me. If the killer is one of us we're in trouble. There's not going to be another crime. And we'll get out when hell turns cold. Ouch, how nice. - You're right. - You're right. Look, he's the one who damned us. He seduced Emine, and damned us all. - I wouldn't get enough of his blood. - Hey, shut up, will you? You shut up. Be quiet, we can't hear you all night long! Our morale is low. None of us is a killer. Here we go again. Another fantasy. I saw the killer. You did? I saw him. He was following us that night. He was a tall guy. He carried a violin case. - Something wrong? - I'm scared. He's probably following us. Don't worry, I've got a gun. No Sir, there's no incident. Thank you Commissioner. Yes Sir. - Don't worry, they're all fine. - Someone on the phone. Yes Sir. Alright, yes. Hello. Oya, is that you? What a nice surprise. Everything's alright, don't worry. He says you needn't worry. Can I speak with my son? Kenan's mother wants to talk with him. Impossible? That's what I'm telling her. She shouldn't worry. But mothers suffer. Pardon? You'll have to wait a few more days. If no new crime comes up he'll remain inside. But if one does we'll release them all at once. Call me anytime. Goodnight. Hello, can you hear me? This is team 5 This is Headquarters, we're listening. I'm announcing an emergency. Attention, attention! Emergency to be registered. Attention, attention, team 3 get ready for action. Looks like we're saved guys. Something's happening, hear the siren? - We can't see anything from here. - We'll soon know. - I think something's happening. - I hope so. - You think they killed some girl? - God is almighty. Something happened? A car accident, with three people dead and five injured. Come on guys, it's still twelve. How's the night gonna pass? - Hello Kemal. - Hi. You can get some sleep, it's my shift. - It's going to be a quiet night, right? - I guess so. I don't like this, either. If the killer was one of those here, everything would be easier. I won't rest till we arrest the woman despiser. Will you be home? If something comes up you can find me home or at this number. What about your marriage case? It'll be done as soon as this is over. Oya is a good girl. - Kemal... - Did I scare you Oya? - The front door was ajar. - Ajar? Someone probably left it like that. I got scared to death. Mother, leaving for Erenkioy, obviously left it open. I was reading, and your footsteps scared me. I'm alone at this hour. - Won't you offer me something? - Would you like some beverage? That's fine. If I drink coffee at this hour I'll sleep in the morning. Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... come on... who do you want? This is Aylin, Hello... Hello... Hello... Hello... You haven't hung up... The receiver is off-hook! Put it on hook please... Hello. . Hello. . Put the receiver on the hook, I cannot call others. Hang up for God's sake. I can't make phonecalls. Put it on the hook, I say! I can't call other people. Hello, hello, attention. A girl named Aylin was murdered in Ayaspasa. Hello, hello. A girl named Aylin was murdered in Ayaspasa. Hello, hello, attention. A girl named Aylin was murdered in Ayaspasa. Hello, hello, attention. A girl named Aylin was murdered in Ayaspasa. All teams must head in that direction. The murder belongs to the series of previous ones. Attention, the murder belongs to the series of the previous ones. That's the woman despiser again. Attention, attention. All cars to Ayaspasa, Kamara street, number 11. All cars to Ayaspasa, Kamara street, number 11. This time we're saved. The sirens are going crazy. I agree. By God, we're saved. No one came. - Perhaps. - We're saved. - I can still hear the sirens. - Yes. Now they must be waiting for the Commissioner or the deputy commander. Who knows where the deputy commander is? We'll get married then, Oya. It will be best for us. Hello, yes he's here. For you. Hello... Yes, yes, is that so? Be right there. Another crime. Some girl Aylin was killed in Ayaspasa. I'm leaving, you go to bed. Now what? Nothing, those poor guys just escaped punishment. Your bother-in-law too. I can't say I'm happy with this news. - Things are still complicated? - A little. Move, you peeper! Not peeper, he's the killer. The killer! I swear, that night he was following us. By God, it was him. If you saw him how he was staring at us as we kissed, you'd go nuts. By God, that's him. Don't you believe me? We're suffering for his sins. He killed Ayse. Talk, talk, or I'll kill you this time. Talk, talk .. Don't look at me, just talk, talk! Look at his eyes, they prove his murders. Look at his eyes my friend. You too, look at his eyes. How guilty he looks. Arrest him. This is the murderer. He was following me and my lover. By God, that's him. You ask him yourselves. I swear to my mother's soul, this is him. I saw him with my own eyes. Talk, talk... Oh, now he's crying. So far, fathers, mothers, lovers have been crying. Look at these. Aren't these the gloves he wears when he kills so that he leaves no fingerprints? - This is the killer. - Yes, that's him. Talk, please, talk. Did you kill Ayse? Why didn't you spare her life? What are you waiting for, why don't you arrest him? They're checking his record. This is the killer Chief. We thought so, too. We know what's in that case, too. But before the last murder, he was arrested in Kadikioy. This is a filthy peeper. In other words, a pervert. We got his statement. As for you... you're free. Apologies to all of you, you may leave. What are you going to do now? The districts where the murders happened and the initials of the victims lead us to the name Melahat. That's either the signature of some Melahat, or it's some madman who has a girlfriend named Melahat. My nickname is Melahat. I like jokes, too. - Nonsense... - Don't be upset. That's not funny. Taslitarla, Tarlabasi, Tepebasi, Tesvikye, Taxim, all districts starting with "T" are under our surveillance. We'll ask for people's assistance, too, on the radio. There's nothing left to do. After we find all Melahat's and those who have girlfriends named Melahat... I made you some coffee, Kemal. You must get used to your house little sister-in-law. Merci. As of tomorrow Oya, you can come here, and stay with Nejla. Oh, great. I got so scared the other day. I don't want you to be alone at nights. If you're here I'll be more relaxed. Today I'll pack up and come here. And we'll have our wedding, as soon as possible. Girls, I must go. I'll call you if I have to. These nights are very important to us. Hi sister-in-law. Oh, Kenan you scared me. Are you leaving? - But why? - I love you as my brother.. Yes Oya.. But I must also change my life. I love someone and I want to live happily with him. From the beginning, things didn't work out well. You shouldn't have married my brother. - Don't start again. - I don't, it's the first time I say it. I love you. Please, don't go. Let's not talk about it, we're going to get hurt. Oya... What's this, are you crying? First time in my life. - Some lady called for a taxi. - I'm afraid she has left. But how can this be. - I think the taxi's here. - No, you're wrong. Better wait here. - Where's mother? - I'm looking for her, too. - Won't you say goodbye to her? - I'll come again. At least wait here till the taxi shows up. Hello, Kemal is that you? - No, she hasn't returned. - She's on her way perhaps? Maybe, bye bye. Hello, yes Kemal, it's me, Oya. I would come, but the taxi hasn't arrived yet. Oya, Oya, answer me! Oya... - Oya... - Kemal. No one can take her away from me. It's Kenan. Kenan. Yes, it's me. I'm not going to leave her to you.. . .Or anybody, understand? I loved you more than anything, Melahat. With the initials of the dead, I wrote a poem after your name. "Bright like the snow". Let her go, let her go I say! You will be mine. Just like you were my brother's, now you'll be mine. I saw you in bed, you were making love with him. But now you'll become glorious and eternal, like the others. The previous ones will come forward to meet you. They have your name. Kenan, Kenan, Kenan... Say my name, say it... Don't be afraid, love me.. Love me as a man. First time I talk to you like this. Let go of my son. You can't go away. You mustn't go away. Take her, son, and get out of here. I've loved you since I was a kid. You were the only woman for me. But you went with my brother. I envied you. I don't want this Kemal, be quiet. Don't leave my son or I'll kill your friend. At first I envied you, but then I realised I loved you Melahat. You've always been Melahat for me. Since the day you came here we grew up together. You were living with my brother, but to me, women were strangers. What they were like, how they made love, I learnt everything from you. I was scared, I was scared I say. When I was with Melek, I closed my eyes and imagined you. But I was afraid of women. On the night of the murder, we were home alone and I wanted to have her. I wanted to conquer her. For the first time, I wanted a woman to become mine. I found some masks. They were here for some fancy dress party. My brother had brought them. I wanted to scare her, as a joke. Melek wasn't afraid of me as a man. And I wanted to scare her with that mask. I got into her room, she ran and fell down from fear. Then, I went closer and raped her. First time in my life. But she was dead. She was still beautiful. She was beautiful. You were all beautiful. You were beautiful Melahat. You were the beautiful one. You. You're crazy. He's not crazy, don't call him crazy. He loved, he just loved. The last murder, how did you do that? I wanted to save my son. It was me who killed her. I knew he'd be released from detention in case there was some murder. No, no, he's not a murderer, he is sick. Don't cry my son. I'll get you a girl, a beautiful girl.. . .Who will not die like the other ones. One who will never die. You will love her, and her name will be Melahat. Her name will be Melahat. She'll be a beautiful girl, a very beautiful girl. Very, very...
