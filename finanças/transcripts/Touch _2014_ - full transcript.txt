Your lawyer's the one who suggested I talk to you. You need to leave it. She could have killed me. If you go to the police... it won't be long until the media finds out. You don't want a bunch of reporters camped out in your front yard. I don't care about that. Did she say anything? She asked me about my kid. I'll sort it! Don't have much time, you know. I'll find her. No police. You alright in there? Come here. Roll the window down. Are you alone? Do you see anyone else? Where are you headed? North!

I'm going to have to get you to walk the length of your car. It's this way, go on, here. Stop there. Can you touch your toes? Are you serious? Okay, we're done. There's a motel about 30 k's along this road. They'll have a room, I suggest you get some proper rest. It's not safe to sleep out here in your car. Night! Okay. Steph. Steph?

Because I want you where I can see you. You can come too. Why can't you sit still for one minute? You've always got such ants in your pants, haven't you? We can't stay in here forever. Sure we can. It's boring. Can I go outside now? I need to hide the car. Come on. Hi... Have you seen this woman? She might have been here yesterday. Are you with the police? Well, I used to be. Didn't like the hours. If you want to know something... she stocked up on junk food. People usually only do that when they're about to hit the highway. Five years of working in this place will teach you that. I'll take those. You can grab another pack, fifty cents. Three dollars. Steph! Yeah? You need to trust me now, okay? Okay. Are we in trouble? Not you... just me, I'm in trouble. Why? Because I hurt someone real bad. Okay. - Good night. - Night. Seven dollars. Can I set up a tab? Hi Carl. I never got your name. No, you didn't. Thanks for walking me home, but I can take it from here. Why? You got a husband or something? I... Look at that! Mine or yours, up to you. What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this anyway? I bet you say that to all the girls you pick up off the highway. Yeah. Pretty much. I don't want you coming to my door. Yeah, no problem. If you do that again... I can hit you back. Thanks for the fuck. No one remembers her. It doesn't mean she wasn't here. Well, thanks for asking. Is she dangerous? If you see her, would you please call me? Ok. Steph! Got you! What are you doing out here? It's so cold! You left me. Well, you know. Come back inside, it's freezing! I wanna go home. Hey, we are home. Home is you and me now. Come on Steph, it's freezing. Let's go back inside and have some breakfast. We can go shopping if you like. Can I get some jeans? Nautilus? Yes. If we can find it. How about this? Umm... ok. This one, please! Come on! It's lovely! Can you try this on? Ok. I'll be back in a minute. I like the jacket... but I wish you to take that swimsuit off. Well I'm not the one who forgot my underwear, am I right Dawn? This is a real find. Isn't it just. Eighteen dollars. Something else take your fancy? Actually yeah... that hat. - This? - Um hum! This is nice, I'll take this too. I need you to pay for the necklace. How much? Everything comes to a $120. Look, I will give you $90 and I don't want the hat. I can do that. When I was a little girl... my mother gave me a necklace like this. She said when I wore it, it would keep me safe. Did it work? Yes... I guess so. It lead me to your father. Shh! What? - I 'm going to pee. - No you don't. - I've got to. - I want to sleep tonight? - Come on. Just take this off. - Did you hear something? Come on! - Please! - No! You're fucking kidding me! You fucking pissed on me! What the fuck? Fuck! It's ok. It's ok... shh. Shh. Go to sleep now. Shh, shh, shh. Hey! MPIK called the car on the ferry. She could be hiding in the hills. Any more hits on the credit card? No. Alright. Thanks... I mean it. Let me know if anything else shows up. There's one thing. You're undertaker mate checked himself out of the hospital. Alright. Thanks, I'll see you. Mom? Mom? Mama! Are you alright? I'm fine. Was I afraid of the dark when I was little? Your favorite game was hide and seek. You'd hide in every cupboard. All the darkest corners of the house. And then when I'd open a door around a corner, you'd leap out of the shadows at me. You'd scare the crap out of me. I guess if anyone was afraid of the dark, it was me. I keep forgetting things. Like what? Like how we got here. That's a silly question, we drove. But what are we doing here? - We're hiding. - From what? I'm keeping us together, Steph. You look so pretty. You were right, it does suit you. I'm going to need some help today baby, I don't feel so good. Could you get me a drink? There's some juice in the fridge. I want to leave this place. There's nowhere to go. Come here baby. Steph? What are you doing? You owe me for two days. Okay, fine. Are you sticking around? I don't know. Where are you going? Can you get out of my room please. I want my money. You can take it off that. The person who's looking for me. He'll be watching for transactions off that card. He'll burn this place to the ground to find me. Well just so you know. I'd better make sure to give myself a big tip then. You seen this woman around here? No. But I saw the car. Come by a few days ago. - Which way? - Come from that direction. Went back the same way. This car? Yes... I reckon. Thanks. Come on. Heard you might be a bit short of petrol. It's yours if you want it. I'm fine. - What are you doing? -You left me in the middle of something last night. Do you want to rape me now? Maybe. Fuck! Fucking bitch. Fuck. What the-- Get out! Pack your things. You're going to have to pay for that chair. Fuck you. And the door. Steph, get in the car. Hello.

So... are you a wife beater or something? Is that what's going on here? What makes you say that? I'm just trying to figure out, why you're in such a hurry to catch someone who doesn't want to be caught. You seem to know a lot about it. Na... I'm just doing my job. Protect and serve. Or service. As the case may be. - Check, saving or-- - Credit. Credit. Dad! Dad! Steph! You come back from the road. Steph! Steph! Steph! Steph! Dawn! Dawn! Dawn. Steph! Steph! Dawn. Where is she?
