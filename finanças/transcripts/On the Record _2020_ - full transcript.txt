Wow. - Uh, when... when Drew disappeared, it didn't strike me per se, because a lot of women had started to disappear. - So when did you find out why she'd left? - Um, when I read "The New York Times." And it was devastating to me. Devastating. I was shaking for days. Every story... every Russell story is personal and... Hard, really, really hard, and so when I read that about Drew, I was in bed. - I stayed in bed - because I was like, "This is my Drew." I immediately went right back there to my 23-year-old self. I know her! So well. Even now, like, this has just unpacked so much, - it's just forced me to think - about all the things That I've endured and experienced and seen, and particularly with Russell, because I was a 22-year-old woman alone with Russell in the early '90s, and so I know exactly what is possible, and even though I... You know, I have fear around speaking, um, publicly for all the wrong reasons, like, I'm smart enough to know that shame has no place and, you know, all the things that I would say to any younger woman who needed my counsel, I have all the right things to say. Um, but I'm also a very private person. I'm also a journalist. I'm not used to being the subject. And this isn't a rape story. That's another reason why I... I think I don't want to conflate my story with other stories. But the fact remains that you can keep something inside for 25 years and keep on keeping on, and then a thing can happen like the bravery of someone like Drew or Sil Lai or Jenny or any of these women who have dared to say a name and speak to a specific time and you didn't have to reconcile. You've gotta deal, and that's really why I showed up today. I'm here really to bear witness and to say I'm really sorry to all of these women who have suffered, and to those who will never tell their story, that's okay too.
