[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SQUEAK OF WHEELCHAIR] 1, 2, 3, 4. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I remember when rock was young, me and Suzie had so much fun, holding hands and skimming stones in an old gold Chevy, and a place my own. But the biggest kick I ever got was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock. While the other kids were rocking around the clock, we were hopping and bobbing to the Crocodile Rock, well crocodile rocking was something shocking when your feet just can't keep still. Never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will. Ow, lawdy mama those Friday nights when Suzie wore her dresses tighter, ah. Crocodile rocking was out of sight. Laaa, la, la, la, laa. La, la, la. What the crap was that? Have you guys ever had music speak to you in the way that you didn't think was possible? Because that was not it. I don't know what you're talking about, man. I thought that was pretty good. Except for Mikey over, who's cheating off that little piece of paper with the chord progression the whole time. Get out of here, man. Yo, Suz, thank you so much for coming out and listening to us. Well, [SCOFFS] more like putting up with us. We really appreciate it. You bet. It's just fun everybody play. Yeah, and you got a pretty good voice yourself here, kid. Cousin ever tell you that? All the time, Jack. She doesn't listen to me though. Stop it, Frank. I don't like, sing, sing. Well that's funny because we just heard you sing, sing. Yeah, Suzie we got to get you playing down at Dino's karaoke night one of these times you guys are in town. Yeah, That's great idea. I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of girl, myself. But that song was really good. And I haven't heard in a while, how's the gig search coming? You know I work every day after school, right? Excuses. Mikey? You know, I just got stuff. [SCOFFS] You got stuff. He's got stuff. If that ain't the most half-assed excuse. Thank you, thank you. That's what I've been trying to tell this guy forever. Thank you for keeping him straight. What about you, Jack? Well, thank you for asking, Suzie because, come to think of it, I would not mind considering a solo career. [LAUGHS] Good luck without us, jackass. Oh, you're very clever Mikey. Guys, come on. You could really be something great. You should totally go for it. Yeah. You're absolutely right. Wait, saying we should get for real, Freddie? Yeah. I am. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, right? Yeah, yeah. We're all right here. We don't have that much longer until we graduate. If we ever want to do something like this, it's got to be right now. What do you say? I'm going to help you. Dude. Ninja Turtles Green. Hell yeah, man. Let's go. Man, I've been waiting for you to say something like this forever. Mike? Come on, man. You know you want to. I just don't know, man. I mean, with everything that's been going on. And then, you know, Redmont. Redmont? Who's that? Oh yeah. I guess you would have heard. There's this kid our school, Garrett Redmont, right. While back he went missing. No one know what happened to him. Cops have been searching all over the place for him. Seems like it's been ages. Probably ran away. Oh my god. I hope he's OK. Do you guys know him? We have homeroom together. We had homeroom together. I don't know him. And I just-- my parents don't really want me out late until they find him. What do you want, Mikey? What kind of question is that? What do I want? I want him to be found. That's great. I mean about the band. Come on, man. Look, we don't have to practice late. Right? I mean, we can just practice right here. That's not far. Come on. You know what? Screw it. I'll try this whole gigging thing. All right. Come on, man. Let's go. One two conditions, on two conditions. OK name them. Go ahead. All right. The one, we finally have to all decide on a killer band name. OK, OK, let me stop you right there, man. Look, I already got a list of ideas. You can chill out. Suzie, you have to sing at least one song with us on our first show. What do you say? Hmm, even better idea-- I can film you guys performing. Small town rock star kids. You'll be a big hit. I like the way you think, kid. You got to deal. Come on, Mikey. How can I ever say no to you guys? Let's turn this thing up to 11. My man, let's go. All right. Woo. All right, come on, guys. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [DOOR OPENING] [TAPE PLAYING] [TELEVISION STATIC] Cool camera. What do you film? Not much. Mostly just the band. The band? [TELEVISION STATIC] [BIRD NOISES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERING] It's close by. Honestly though, why the hell are we even out here, again? You know why. You scared, Tuckman? Say what you will, Miller When the Redmont kid went missing in these woods a while back. I'm at least concerned about us being out here alone. Well, when it's the middle of the day and there's no one around. Tuck, admit it. You're just scared of the big, bad, gray house. [RAIN SOUNDS] They said on the news that he lives close by. Think he wrote it or something? No, idiot. Why would he carve a suicide note into a freaking tree? You seen that kid? That seems like something that a wuss would do. He didn't kill himself, Miller. The cops would have found a body by now. Maybe he ran away or something. What do you think this means, anyway? What do I think? It's already screwed up. To hell with life. We don't even know what the real point is. Deep thoughts, Mill. Thanks. I got to have a lot of those to make up for something else. Ass hat. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Hey, you punk. What are you doing? Following us? I'm sorry, man. I was just passing by. All right, all right. I didn't mean nothing by it. I was-- [INAUDIBLE] Tough, let's get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RAIN] Starlight Club? Seriously, Frank? I think it'd be great for us They have small bands perform there all the time, man. I don't know about that, man. I mean, a group that's got to wait out the rain at the library so their equipment don't get wet might not be the best fit, you know. I don't know. Maybe we should wait a little bit longer for Mikey to show. I mean, could've just gotten rained out at home. It's just now clearing up. I don't know. Listen, I'll tell you what, man. If you want to stay at the library and wait for Mikey show up, then that's fine. But I've got to talk to the owner at 4:00, OK? So if you don't show by then I'll just see you at practice. All right. See you then, man. [DOGS BARKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Good. What's up? Not much. Frank still hasn't gotten back from that meeting he was at, though, so you're not late. Don't worry. Yeah. But if it's taken him this long, I guess it's either going real well or no bueno, you know? Eesh. Hey, man. Hey. Hey, man. I'm really sorry about missing earlier and I'm sorry I'm late. It's just been one of those days. Got you being in school but I don't look like I feel you. You doing all right now, man? Ah. Something came up. I'm just a little spaced out, I guess. Yeah. I got you. If it's that bad, you can always go on home, Mikey. I'm sure Frank will understand. Oh, and your mom called. She was wondering if you were OK. I'll call her back later. Right now I just want to practice and get my mind off that creepy gray house and-- Do you go by the gray house? Yeah, man. What about it? Nothing. It's just-- I mean, that place is just creepy as hell, you know? I mean, now why you'd want to go by there. I mean, did you take a bet or something? It's not that. It's just, wel-- you know what? Never mind it's nothing. I was just out in the sun for too long, started imagining things. Yeah, it's my bad for missing the Starlight thing. No it's nothing, man. It's cool. OK, well you guys will never guess what happened earlier at the library, right. You'll never guess who turned up after Frank left. Redmont. How'd you guess? It's crazy. No. Look. Hey, come on in out of the cold, man. Are you sure? I don't want to barge in. No, it's fine. Look, it's not my house. I live close by, and I saw you come this way. And I wanted to say thanks for what you did earlier. Hey you bet, man. It's all good. What the hell, man? I mean, are you guys OK? Yeah we're good, man. It's all right. Like, I found him outside of the library in the park. I don't know how much you remember, man. I mean, you were out cold and you're kind of in and out real hazy. I took you straight to the hospital afterwards. I don't know what happened to him, man. I mean-- I can't thank you enough. I saw you this way a bit ago. And I tried to catch up to you. I don't even know your name. Oh it's good, man. It's Jack. Jack Wilson. Oh it's Garret, right? Sorry. Yeah but people call me Red. Yeah, yeah. That's because you're a fiery personality, right? No, because my hair-- I'm messing with you, man. Is my friend Mikey, my friend, Suzie. It's nice to meet you, Red. Hey, don't take this the wrong way. We love having you here and all but you just got back from the hospital. Wouldn't you rather be home than, I don't know, here? That's OK, Red. Because I don't think Mikey here meant to bring up a sensitive subject, now did he? Well, I would but it doesn't really feel like they care about me. They didn't even show up to the hospital when you were there. I'm sorry, man. I didn't know. I was just as worried as the next guy, you know, when I heard what-- When you heard what? That I ran away? I didn't say anything. And you didn't have to. I know people think. I'm not some scared little kid who ran away from home because life got hard. A few weeks ago I was going to school like any other kid. Then I woke up in the hospital and people say weeks later. I'm sorry, guys, you let me in and I start talking like that. I'm sorry. It's all right. You've had a rough time, it sounds like. It's OK. Thanks Suzie, wasn't it? Mm-hm. That's right. Do you want to stay? Hear the band practice. The band? You guys? LEDs in the flesh. No, no, no. No, no. That was number one on your list. No it's not. Well, we'd love for you to stay and listen to us play, man. Oh, I don't know. What kind of music is it? You like hard rock? [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Running with the devil. Ahwoo. Running with the devil. Ahwoo. Running with the devil. Ahwoo. Ahwoo. Mmm. Ahh. Loved it, boys. I'm so glad you loved our song about Satan, Suzie. Yo, Red. What's your verdict? It was cool and all, but I'm more of a hip hop guy, myself. Rock and roll's here to stay, man. It will never die. I'm going to rest up. If you guys want any, there's pizza in the fridge. You for real, man? All right. I wouldn't mind some myself right about now. Yo, make sure you save the rest of us peasants some crumbs. What you talking about, man? Are you implying something? Yeah, that you'd eat half of that pie by yourself, Mr Wilson. I don't know what you're talking about, man. Because I'd eat the whole thing. [INAUDIBLE] You know, a kid like you who eats that much is going to grow up to be a fat, middle-aged man. Oh-uh, I can't hear you over the hypocrisy. [DRUMS PLAYING] [PIANO PLAYING] That's nice, Frank. What is it? It's nothing. It's just the intro to that Whitesnake song. Suz, I don't know if we're ready. I honestly don't. I'm glad you've been here to support us through this whole thing but I honestly don't think we're ready. You guys are ready. I mean, you may not know everything there is to know about music or whatever but you'll be great. You know why the drama gets better the more he plays? Takes a while for the drumstick. That was bad, Suzie. That was not good. Well, think about it, a year ago I didn't know much about this lights, camera, action business. But since you got me this, I can't stop. I stuck with it. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Thanks, kid. Don't ever let your light go out. Isn't that a Whitesnake song? Probably. Hey, you never said how you're meeting went. Hey, if either of you guys wants anything to eat, you to get it out before Jack goes back for seconds. Hey, man. Don't think I introduce myself. It's Frank. Garrett. But people call me Red. Thanks, everybody for letting me stay. It really means a lot. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Of course. I'm glad you're all right, man. Anyways, I got to get going. I enjoyed listening to the music. Yeah, hold up, actually. I didn't get a chance to tell you guys about the meeting at the club. [INTERPOSING VOICES] How'd it go, mate? It could have been better. I talked to the owner of the club and it didn't go too good. Oh. Wait, are you saying we didn't get it then? Well, there's one problem. Yeah. We got to find a band name to go on to the marquee. What? What, we got it? Let's go, man. All right. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [LAUGHTER] Listen, three weeks from Saturday-- Yeah. We're going to need a band name, set list, and we'll be good to go. All right, that sounds good, man. All right, so what are we going to play? I'm definitely into the Elton John stuff. OK. Yeah. OK, so we're practicing like, that Bon Jovi, Van Halen type stuff. Like, is that cool? Does it-- [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD SOUNDS] [RAIN] [WHISPERING] Hello? Hello. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I didn't mean to scare you. No, no, no, it's all right. Had you'd been a snake you would have bitten me. Sorry. I'm horrible with introductions. I'm Suzie. Robert. Robert Grayson. Are you new in town, Suzie. I don't think I've seen you before. No, I'm just visiting my cousins. Do you know Frank Barrens? Does he go to the high school? Yeah. You look about the same age. Do you know him? No, I'm home schooled. Is that that a no? Haven't you how uninformed homeschoolers are? [LAUGHS] I don't really know if it's my place, and we've just met, but are you OK, Robert? I'm sorry. I should-- No, no. It's OK. Saw this, didn't you? And you probably figure that a guy like me wouldn't be sitting out in dust and, not hunting, well, what else would I be doing? No, no, it's not. It's not. Except it is. I'm not OK, Suzie. Every day all I see is struggling. People struggling. Working hard every day and then the downside of life drags them down. Then they die. It's unavoidable. I figure, why not just cut off the middleman? Get the suffering over with, you know? It's hard to see a light when it's this dark. Yeah. Maybe there's no light at all. Maybe it's just some big lie, a sham. You mean the light is the lie? Something like that. Hey, you know what? Even if it's dark, there's still light. Even if there's a shadow, there's a light out there to cast that shadow. Cool camera. What are you filming? Not much. Mostly just the band. The band. OK, I'm starting to think you're the one from out of town. Frank's band is playing a show at the Starlight in a few weeks. Sorry, I hadn't heard. It's three weeks from Saturday, if you want to come and you totally should. They're really good. It's not my scene. What types of music do they play? What kind of music do you like? The good stuff. You know, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly. It's really sad what happened to them. Yeah. It's really sad. The King was only like, 42. Yeah, sure. Well, the boys are really into that classic rock stuff. You would really like it. Thanks, Suzie. Now you ought to get going. It's getting dark out. Well, it was nice to meet you, Bob. Robert. Bob was my father. Right. See you later, Bob. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CELLPHONE VIBRATION] [DIAL TONE] [KNOCKING] It's me, Red. Hey, Red. Hey, Frank. I was just wanting to let you know, I finished hanging up the ads for the band around town. Thanks, man. Yeah, you bet. Where are the guys? Don't get me started on them, man. Why? Is everything OK with them? Yeah, they just didn't show up for practice today. Probably went home and slept. I just can't believe them. Well, ever since you got that gig, you've been rehearsing every few minutes. Ever since I-- for about two weeks now. Maybe you're working a little too hard? Don't you have somewhere to be? It's late. Well, actually, I saw those shady guys Mikey told me to watch out for. So I was thinking about staying here for bit until they're gone. Yeah, that's fine. Man, I swear those guys looked like they had it in for me. I'm glad I dumped them down in Sombora and fifth. Frankie, chill out, man. I'm sorry, Red. I just can't rest until I get my work in. You know? Yeah. Nothing ever end. Hell is that supposed to mean? Sorry it's from the comic book. I guess it means, I hope the best for you. And I hope one day you can look back on this and it's everything you hoped it would be. [MUSIC PLAYING] Your mom wants you to come inside. You got a long ride home tomorrow. Yeah, OK. Do you know anybody around here who homeschools? Why would I know them if they're homeschooled? [INAUDIBLE] Come on in, man. 30 years, Frank. Just like that. I missed you, Mikey. Come on in, brother. Hey, hey. [LAUGHS] Oh my goodness. Looks like somebody's been hitting the cookies. Impressive use of you psychic powers there, Professor Xavier. What the crap, Jack? All these years and you're going to open with a cripple joke? Had you for a second. Man, I just call them like I see them. You know it, man. This. So, man, what pays the bills? Hold up now. Here I thought I was being rung up for a reunion and we weren't going to have to talk about the old grind. Oh come on, Mike. Don't you want to hear about how I turned my incredible athletic ability and slim physique into work as a trapeze artist? Either of you guys buying that for even like, half a second? Hell no. All right, guys. We don't have to talk about work if you don't want to. Man there's still so much to catch up on. Yeah, for sure. So, sure life's been busy for you guys. How life treating my boys? For me, it's still work. Just the work, just the working life. Jeez, man. You should really Google those lyrics, Mr Springsteen, I'm just saying. I'm just glad I'm not the only one who still talks in lyrics. Right? My man, though. But hey look, you did kind of promise us that you weren't going to talk about work anymore. All right, fair enough. So how's the wife and kids? No wife no kids, man. Just a girlfriend back at home. How about you? Nah, I never married. And I worked so much I've never even dated seriously. Just wasn't in the cards for me. How about you, Mikey. I don't see a ring on your finger. Hey, you know me. No one could ever tie me down. Is this the part where we get that revelation. No. OK. Well, come to think of it, I do kind of remember that one time when we were able to tie you down to the bass guitar for the band. That seems like 1,000 years ago. Yeah it does. But you know, we came back here after all this time and-- Just feels like we're picking up right where we left off or something, doesn't it? Exactly. Yo, guys I really wish we had kept in touch better after all this time. It just seems like I forgot. Like, gets so busy, you know? Wait, I forgot-- forgot? You forget something, old man? Yes. It's crazy, man. Like, we're back here for this high school band reunion and, silly me, like, I can't even remember the name of the band we're in. Like I'm some senile old grandpa or something. Weren't you the one that came up with it? Yeah. I mean, I remember coming up with Suzie and we just-- wait a minute. Suzie Why does that name sound so familiar? Guys, I wish I could say I invited you over just to catch up on old times. But I think it's time we got down to business, gentlemen. What business is that, Frank? Coming home. This old town. Even you guys. Never crossed my mind for decades. And I come back to probate my dad's will. Guys, things start happening. At least, I start remembering them. [MUSIC PLAYING] Dammit. Calm down, man. Mikey it's fine. Calm down, man? Calm down, man? After that load of crap of a performance? Dude, chill out. What are you talking about? Went pretty good. A good job? Yeah. A good job after all that practice we went through? Yeah what are you talking-- I worked like hell to get this thing pulled together. It all fell to pieces out there. Should've never tried this. Come on, man. Look man, I know you're upset. And I know we weren't, like, perfect or anything. But I think if you just sit down and listen to what you're saying -- Sit down? Sit down is all you did, Mike. You had no life out there. Zero. You weighed us down. What the hell, man? Talking is all you did on that stage, Jack. It's about me now? Talking is all you did. Try singing next time, instead of flirting with every hoe you make eye contact with. You know what? If you spent half as much time in those damn drums out there, instead of criticizing us, I think we'd be doing all right. OK. You know what? I think you're full of it. You know what? I'm tired of this crap. Guys, shut the hell up. You know, I'm tired-- You know, when Suzie wanted us to do this whole thing, I was hesitant but I had no idea why. This is why. I don't need this, guys. I'm out of here. No, no, come on. Hey, hey, man it'll be OK. Mikey. Mikey, come back, man. Look what you did. Look what you did. That was your fault. Frank. I broke up with my girlfriend for this band, man. So I had time to practice. I gave up time with other friends for this thing and I can't get that back, can I? So, you're just going to go and turn on us when the going gets tough like this? Good luck without us, asshole. [MUSIC PLAYING] Frankie? Look who decided to show up. It's funny because you were here in the beginning. And now you're here to see it all end. You know, come to think of it, it's your fault. My fault? But Mikey and Jack-- this was always your dream, Frank. No, no, no, no, no. If I remember correctly, it's what you wanted us to do. All right? You pushed us when we weren't ready and now-- Just get out. Just get out. What? Just get out. It's your fault. Get out of my life, twerp. Things I had forgotten. For as long as I could remember, I just gradually lost use of my legs. And I could have sworn that Suzie's obituary said something about a hiking accident. Then, I remembered what really happened. Mike, Jack. How much do you guys remember about the Starlight? [MUSIC PLAYING] Woohoo. [INTERPOSING VOICES] What the heck was that, man? [INAUDIBLE] Oh, man. That was so good. Free beer, my man. Let's go. Now that, my friends, is what I call it, when music speaks to you. [LAUGHS] There you go. Hey, Jack, you still giving me a ride afterwards? Yeah, man. You know it. Great. I'm going to go put my bag in the trunk. I'll be back to help the drums. Awesome. You got it. You did so well. [INAUDIBLE] No man, I didn't see her. I know she was really looking forward to tonight. I don't know why she wasn't-- uh-ha. Wait, she wasn't there either? You're sure? Yeah well, I didn't see her. OK. I'll ask the people at the box office up front if they saw her. OK. I love you too. Hey, it's going to be OK. OK, bye. You all good, man? Mom says Suzie's not at home. I don't know where she'd be. [WHISPERING] Suzie. Suzie. Suzie. Suzie. Suzie. [DOOR RATTLING] Suzie. Suzie. [CONCERT MUSIC SOUNDS] [GRUNTS] What the hell do you guys think you're doing? Hey, hey, man. I don't know what you're doing-- I expected moral. You shut down, man. He says it's the lost blade of the host. He too would pay for his thievery. Where did they-- Miller, what the hell? Hey. [LAUGHTER] Hello? [WHISPERING] Suzie. Hello? Jack? Suzie? I thought you were gone. Jack, what happened to you? You did. I wanted to live up to your expectations. You know, play together with the band but never really worked out. [WHISPERING] Frank was right. Yeah, Frank was right. It was just too hard. You pushed us too hard. What are you talking about? Talking about you, Suzie. You're the reason all this happened the way that it did. You know, all my life since then, I've been trying to live up to everybody else's ridiculous expectations. Look how it worked out for me. It didn't. [LAUGHTER] It's been a while, Suzie. [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know, man. [MUSIC PLAYING] Guys. Get the hell out of here. What? Mikey? Mikey? Hey. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, no, no. Stop. Snap out of it, man. Mike, what the hell? He's completely lost it. He and his friend, Joe [INAUDIBLE].. Why did you try so hard? Why did you try to make the band work? It wouldn't have worked out anyway. We had a good thing going. Then you came along. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stop. [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] You will return what was stolen, whether he remembers or not. And become one with the void, just as the girl was. Girl? What girl? Parents. Time and memory are beyond the void. And cannot be defeated. [WHISPERING] Frankie? What's going on? It's all your fault. Don't you understand, Suzie? You thought with some happy-go-lucky words you could turn Jack into an amazing frontman. Look at him. Couldn't do that. Now he can't lead at all. And Mike was already afraid of commitment. And ever since your little band falls apart, he's so emotionally crippled he's never been able to make a serious commitment. Speaking of crippled. Just look at me. Just wanted to encourage you. As you did for me. Great job, Suzie. Got me to follow my dreams. All I do work. Seven days a week. 16 hours a day. Probably for the rest of my life. Even with all that work, I still can't produce like I used to. Not since the accident. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] It has taken you [INAUDIBLE]. What the hell is 'it'? The darkness. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [RATTLING] [INAUDIBLE] Is this hard to hear, Suzie? Good. I want you to know how hard it's been for us. You've ruined us, Suzie. I hope you never forget that. Nice job, Suzie. Way to screw everything up. Our lives, the band. Why don't you just give up? Just get out. It's your fault. Get out of my life. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [GASP] [DOOR OPENING] Don't listen to them, Suzie. This is all a lie. Red? Don't listen because 'it's' trying to do to you what it tried to do to me. It? What are you talking-- You have to remember what your cousin said, don't ever let your light out. I'll never let your light go out. I see now. This thing is controlling these people. Whatever's controlling you two, it won't win. No. The light is a lie. Not real. No, no, Miller, it's not you. Snap out of it, man. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh my god. I'm sorry for everything. I treated you so poorly. I neglected you. Those damn drums just got in the way. No. I'm sorry too. I came here and I saw you and I-- No. It's whatever 'it' wanted you to see. That wasn't you. Rock and roll is here to stay. It'll never die. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, guys. They're gone. Ah. Hey, what's wrong? My head. Robert? This was my parents' house. I remember all the meals we used to eat together. Mother was always worrying about whatever she was trying to prep for Sunday dinner. Father was always complaining about whatever was on the news. My little sister. She was always talking about whatever her friends got that she wanted for Christmas. They left me. A long time ago. All three of them. Now I'm alone. I was once Robert Grayson. And then I saw the void in my heart. I served it. Not for much longer. I may not look it, so old, so cold, so tired. There will soon be another, another host for the void. I don't understand. This thing can't be you, Robert. He isn't is Robert Grayson anymore. Or whoever he was. He found this darkness, the same thing that took the bullies, it turned him some kind of puppet. So you saw the light too and remembered, did you, power stealer? You've proven to be quite resilient. You're the one who took my memories. As you were to be the next host, you wouldn't have needed them, Garrett Redmont. You escaped. The only mortal to ever do so. You're more trouble than you're worth. Suzie, however. [MUSIC PLAYING] You won't win. We've seen the light. That will only delay the inevitable. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING AND SCREAMING] Garrett. Red, you have to help him. Come on, you're the only one that can stop him. I can't. He's too, too powerful. No. No, he's just a name. You've escaped him once before. You got this. You saved me. Now save them. You can't defeat the void. And you can't give power [INAUDIBLE].. It's not your power. It isn't power at all. This is my light. And it's not going out anytime soon. Ahhh. [COUGHING AND MOANING] Ah. Mikey, you OK? Yeah, I'll be fine. [COUGHING] Frankie. You OK, man? Guys, I can't feel my legs. Guys, I can't feel my legs. Help me. . OK. OK on three. 1, 2, 3 Come on. Sit him down right over here. [GRUNTING AND MOANING] [COUGHING] Red said that it would make you forget, like he did. But you can't. When it comes back one day you all have to come back here. And you beat it. For good this time. You all have to swear that, when you remember, you'll come back. I swear. I swear. I swear. Suzie, I'm sorry. It's OK. Remember, it takes a while for the drums to stick, right? Yeah. Don't forget me either, OK? I can't, Suzie. None of us can. Oh. Jack? Yeah, kid? I thought of a great band name. [COUGHS] What's that? Magnum Opus. [INAUDIBLE] [COUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Guys, come on. We got to get out of here. Come on. [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] We remember now. Maybe not everything, but we remember enough. We remember the light and your tricks are not going to work here anymore. I understand why you wanted Suzie. And Red. They were the best of us. Who aren't simple-minded thugs that you could just manipulate. What they had, that was real power. So you just had to try to bring Suzie down to your level, to try to make her power your own. Well, I'm here to tell you, that kind of power can't be stolen. If you think that that power is really yours, you've wasting away in his hiding place for way too long. Let's do it for Suzie. For Red. Yeah. Here we go again. [MUSIC PLAYING]
