[soft instrumental music] [music continues] [Anne] I almost got married once. Wentworth held my heart. But he was a sailor without rank or fortune. And I was persuaded to give him up. [music slows down, then stops] [playful instrumental music] [Anne] Now I'm single and thriving. I spend my time drinking fine wines, enjoying warm baths... and lying face down on my bed. Like I said, thriving. Who needs romance when one has... family? [playful music continues] My father. He's never met a reflective surface he didn't like. Vanity is the beginning and end of his character. Also the middle. "Sir Walter Elliot, born March 1st, 1760." "Man of consequence, known for his exquisite jawline." [Anne] He is the sole object of his own warmest respect and devotion. [sighs] One's family is only escapable by two things, marriage and death. Both seem unlikely in the immediate future. "Married July 15th, 1784, to Jane." My mother. - I miss her. - [Sir Walter] "Jane died in 1801." "By her, Sir Walter issued three children." My sisters. [Sir Walter] "Elizabeth, celebrated beauty and Somerset's most fashion-forward luminary." Elizabeth, the eldest. [Sir Walter] "Mary, married to Charles Musgrove, heir to the superior Uppercross estate." Mary, the youngest. "And Anne, born August 9th, 1787." And me, middle child, the crack in his looking glass. Shame there wasn't anything nice we could think to add about you, Anne. Thanks for trying. You're welcome. I wanted to leave you out entirely, but Daddy thought people might think you had died. - Debt collectors. - [Elizabeth] Daddy. Daddy! [Anne] The one thing my father loves more than himself is spending money. It was always going to run out one day. - Daddy... - Daddy's broke, princess. Playtime's over. Oh! [lawyer] There, there, Sir Walter. Lots of people face debt at some point in their lives. You must retrench. You have no choice. I've drawn up a vigorous plan of economy. The most necessary reductions are underlined. Meet my mother's best friend and unflinching speaker of truth. Lady Russell took it on herself to give me advice on every topic as she felt my mother would have. Always insightful and helpful. With one... notable exception. Some people don't have homes or food. Try to put this into perspective. Mr. Shepherd, if I was interested in gaining perspective by thinking of the poor, I'd ask you the rate charged by your barber. Don't ask me to change things by seeing them differently. See things my way, then change them until they are different. Perhaps we need only stop giving to charities. Do we do that? Jane would be ashamed. She begged me to protect her daughters from their father's excessive excesses and I have failed. Your arrogance will bankrupt them all. Father, true reputation comes from honesty, integrity, compassion, acceptance of responsibility for the welfare of others. Anne, we're speaking of something substantial. Try to keep up. Why not downsize and move somewhere cheaper? Bath is lovely. And the spas there will work wonders for your skin. And what of Kellynch Hall? Just the other day I met a wealthy naval officer who would pay a handsome rent for a house like Kellynch. I will not have a Navy man in my house. - They're all ugly. - Admiral Croft is quite handsome. Admiral? What right has the British Navy to bring persons of obscure birth into undue distinction? Only God has the right to bestow rank. What good is a title if you have to earn it? What good is anything if you have to earn it? Admiral Croft is a fine gentleman. His wife told me about a brother who lived among us a few years back. He was also a naval officer. What was his name? Uh, Wellington? Weathers? Winslow? You mean Wentworth? - [Mr. Shepherd] Wentworth? Yes. - Anne, darling. In truth, I can hardly remember who you are speaking of. [Sir Walter] You really think my skin will do well in Bath? [Lady Russell] Oh, yes. - [Lady Russell] Yes. - [knock on door] Sweetheart... it's been seven years. Eight. You couldn't possibly still feel... I do. Frederick Wentworth was the only person, save you and my mother, who ever really saw me. And understood me. And loved me. Aw. And the only one I wanted to... Exchange calling cards with? Well put. You lied when you told me time would heal me of my pain. - You're angry with me. - I'm angry with myself. For... being persuaded. For not seeing then what I see so clearly now. That I would have been a far happier woman in keeping him than I have been in giving him up. Hmm. I'm sorry. The truth is, marriage is transactional for women. Our basic security is on the line. I could not let you throw yourself away on a man with no rank, no fortune, nothing but himself to recommend him. That was the part I liked. Besides, all of his confidence was justified. He is rich now. And a captain. Then, why haven't you heard from him? Because... I broke his heart. And he knew why. I thought I was protecting you. I was wrong. I see that now. And I'm sorry. [sighs] You will find the one that's meant for you. The one who loves you enough to fight for you. Darling, I admire how strongly you feel about it, but at some point, you have to move on. I fear Wentworth is a ship that has sailed, so I say this with love. Abandon all hope. [receding footsteps] It's true, he hasn't written to me. But... I knew he wouldn't. [sniffs] He respects himself too much to beg. He didn't fight for me because he could never value a love that wasn't offered freely. I'm sure he's put it all behind him. I, on the other hand, have kept it painfully in front of me. [playful instrumental music] The first note he passed me in church. The playlist he made me. One lock of hair from him. And one from his horse, Sampson, whom I scarcely knew. And this cow bell, whose sad, empty knell best captures my melancholy. [clangs] Eight years of it. He's been all over. And the Navy adores him. "Frederick Wentworth turns a pretty penny aboard the Laconia." "Frederick Wentworth rescues a beached whale as onlookers weep." And yet... no marriage announcement. Nothing at all to indicate he's since been in any way attached to another. In other words... hope springs eternal. [laughter in the room] [Elizabeth] As we're moving, I need to think about my Bath persona. I think Bath Elizabeth should be less sophisticated than London Elizabeth, but not as free-spirited as country Elizabeth. Penelope, what do you think? You'll accompany the Elliots north, Mrs. Clay? Oh, I wouldn't dream of imposing. Of course you would. You dream of nothing but. And lucky for you, I wouldn't dream of going anywhere without you. Mrs. Penelope Clay, widowed, though she never speaks of it. He was a corpse when they met, so perhaps the transition escaped her attention. Lady Russell worries that Mrs. Clay has designs on my father, but I don't think she's his type. Besides, can you actually imagine my father marrying down? Oh, you must come, if your father can spare you. Mr. Shepherd, do you think you can spare Penelope? Hmm. Good, fine, exquisite, Sir Walter. [chuckles] You really are too generous for your own good! [laughs] [Sir Walter] We'll need your pleasant company to make amends for the many plain faces we shall have to endure in Bath. Now, Sir Walter, not everyone was made to be handsome. Your beauty will shine twice as brightly amongst them. It is said if you're a five in London, you're a ten in Bath. Well, just think, you and Elizabeth, you'll be thirteens there. [Sir Walter and Elizabeth laugh] You'll be at least a six, Anne. [Mr. Shepherd slurps] [Elizabeth] Anyway, Anne won't be joining us for quite some time. What? I got a letter from Mary today. She's ill again and needs you at Uppercross immediately. I know you barely tolerate her. Still, it's a more positive reaction than anyone else has towards her, making you the logical choice. [Mr. Shepherd slurps] Fabulous. [Elizabeth] Make sure the nice linens are hidden before the admiral arrives. Why? Do you think they'll steal them? I don't like the idea of their naked skin on my sheets. It might bring you luck. And hide the ledgers. I don't want anyone assuming my identity. I don't think anyone wants your credit at this point, Father. Oh, and remind them, in a gentle way, never to go anywhere near my rose garden. Oh, yes, please. And the shrubberies. I don't like the idea of my shrubberies being enjoyed by others. Use the scratchy linen, don't set foot in the garden and don't look at the shrubberies. Any other hospitable words? That is all. Oh, but please make sure every room is spotless before they arrive. I don't want rumors circulating about dust. [playful music stops] [melancholic music plays] [birds chirping] [Admiral Croft] Oh. It's even more incredible than we were told. You mustn't worry, we'll be excellent tenants. Do you always travel with your husband? Oh, yes. And no one will ever stop me. [Anne chuckles] I've crossed the Atlantic four times, gone once to the East Indies and back again. Cork, Lisbon, Gibraltar... The happiest moments of my life have been spent aboard a ship. You're very lucky. [Mrs. Croft] You'll see when you're in love. You know, Anne, Mrs. Croft's baby brother is a bachelor. He's a captain in the Navy, quite successful. Edward, please don't. A woman without a husband is not a problem to be solved. - I knew your brother, actually. - [Mrs. Croft] Did you? - Oh, how wonderful. - [Anne chuckles] Perhaps we can all have dinner together once he joins us. Joins you? - [Mrs. Croft] His ship just docked. - [Admiral] He'll be here in two days. These gardens are so beautiful. [music continues] I wonder how he feels as to a meeting. If he'd wished to see me before now, he need not have waited. He's angry still, I'm sure. What if I've been wrong? What if he's been pining for me day and night all these years? [music rising] [coachman] Whoa there! Here you are. [music slows down] [Mary] Can someone help me? Mary is preferable to Elizabeth in that she's a total narcissist. So, conversing with her requires very little energy and can be great fun. Once, I went an entire 24 hours speaking exclusively in Italian. She only noticed when I asked her to pass the sale. She's so wrapped up in her own suffering that, until I clear my throat, she won't even notice I'm here. Watch. First, she'll complain about some unidentifiable ailment that has her on the verge of death. Next, she'll rail against her husband for not caring for her properly. And then she will assault her in-laws, who constantly disrespect her and must secretly despise her. [clears throat] I'm monstrously relieved you're here. I don't know what it is. A bug of some sort. I can't move. I'm on the verge of death. Charles is out shooting, not a single caring word on his way out. Hmm. And my in-laws sent me that lovely bouquet. Isn't that sweet? They'll rot, and I'll feel worse than if they hadn't sent anything at all. Hmm. How unkind is it to remind a dying person of decay? Anne, these people hate me. The children are monsters, the house is drafty and nobody cares about the theater anymore. Precisely, Anne, yes. - Anne! - Anne! Meet my sisters in-law, Henrietta and Louisa Musgrove. They are beautiful in every way. - Anne! - [Anne] Girls! We were so glad when Mary said that you'd come. We've been positively giddy all week. You must promise to spend every waking second with us, no excuses. [Mary clears throat] When you aren't attending to your sister of course. - How are you feeling, Mary? - You haven't asked me how I'm feeling. - I just did. - [Mary] I'm close to death. I can feel my organs decomposing. - [giggling] - Same as yesterday, then. Encouraging that, though her organs rot, her personality remains as fresh as ever. [all laugh] Anne, you must dine with us every night, delight us with your playing, because we will do nothing but dance and sing and laugh. [kids] Marie Antoinette! [Anne] How dare you speak my name, you naughty subjects! Careful, boys, ladies don't like to be trampled. And your mother has a headache. To have things near your face when you don't know where they've been! We're hungry, Marie Antoinette. - Well, let them eat cake! - [Charles] No cake until after supper. There'll be special guests tonight. We'll meet Admiral Croft and his wife. She's bringing her brother, Frederick Wentworth. Just arrived this morning, we hear. A gallant captain! I heard he once redirected an entire flotilla to save a beached whale. [Mary] I had no idea you were fond of whales. [chuckles] - Have you ever met Captain Wentworth? - In passing, long ago. - Is it true he's devastatingly handsome? - He has a kind face, yes. And is it true he actually listens when women speak? He listens. He listens with his whole body. It's... electrifying. Well, then, he sounds like just the man for you. - I insist you pursue him. - Louisa... No, no. I've made up my mind, Anne. No more hiding your light underneath a bushel. You are very sweet, but I'm not interested in receiving instruction on where to put my light. Or my bushel. [giggles] Tell me, honestly, why aren't you married? I'm waiting to fall in love. All right, here's what you'll do. At dinner, you'll sit right next to him. I'll sit right next to him. Then, you'll pretend not to know a thing about anything. Men like explaining things. Tell him you've never used utensils, ask him to teach you how to hold them. Is this how they're teaching courtship these days? Then, just when he starts to seem interested, don't respond to a single thing he says. As though you're a ghost. He'll be hooked. [giggles] So, then, just be myself. Oh no. Don't do that until at least the second year of marriage. That may not be the worst advice. - Mary! - Charles. What happened? Mary, help. He's hurt his arm. - [Mary] What has he done? - He fell from a tree. Of course this happens the one evening people of interest are set to visit. He didn't fall on purpose, Mary. Someone will have to stay with him. I'll bring you back some plum pudding. So, it's the mother who must stay, then. It's not enough I brought these humans into the world, I must now miss dinners on account of them. This is just my luck. If there is anything disagreeable, men are sure to get out of it. Mary, my sweet, he's hurt. And you aren't feeling quite yourself either. Oh no, that's cleared up entirely. I'm sure the Crofts will come again. Oh, I hate my life. If it's really bothering you, I'm happy to stay with you. That goes without saying. Of course. I'm not gonna stay alone. Wouldn't it be hard to be away from little Charles when he's in so much pain? No, Louisa. Please understand. The thing about me is, I am an empath. I'm actually the least equipped to be with my children when they're suffering because I feel it so deeply. It's much better for me to be away. Life is so much easier for people like Anne who aren't so sensitive. Mary, would you like me to stay alone while you go to dinner? That's so kind. I'll bring you back some plum pudding. And perhaps a crust of bread and some gruel? Don't worry, Anne, I'll talk you up. I'll paint such a pretty picture, he'll be ready to propose by morning. Promise. [door closes] [slow melancholic music] [music continues] [sighs] If only I could talk to him. [sighs] [music becomes playful] Frederick! [woman] Oh. Oh! Oh. Ouch. [dog barks in distance] [gasps] [sighs] [sighs] Perfect. [music stops] [screaming and laughter] Thanks again for last night, Anne. I really think you would have liked Captain Wentworth. Um, this jam is too soggy. I'd rather not have jam at all if it is to be soggy. I want to be a captain. Absolutely not. No nephew of mine will be a sailor. Don't you know they have to wear silly hats? Anne, please, I can't endure the sound of laughter before noon. And the rules are you must grow a silly mustache. [kids laugh] - Mm. - [Mary] No. [Charles] Wentworth doesn't have a mustache, but he is quite impressive. Handsome, intelligent, rich. - [child] Do it again! - [Anne] Oh, look at me. I'm Captain Wentworth and I am very impressive! I'm rich and I'm handsome and everybody loves me! And I'm a sailor! [Charles] Uh, Captain, meet Mary's sister, Anne. - Actually, we... We've met. - We've met. - Oh. - Long ago, before I was rich. But not before I was handsome. You look... old. - I didn't mean that. - What did you mean? Old... Older... than you used to look. - Your face has matured. - Small price to pay for a life of purpose. - Are you implying my life lacks purpose? - How would I know? Your hair remains intact. Your hair is also suitably appropriate. - Thank you. - So, then, you two really have met. - Fleetingly. - And yet memorable in its fleetingness. Shall we go? - We shall. - Yes. Oh. [Anne sighs] - What? - You still have jam on your face. [laughs] [slow instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] My dress is soaked. [Louisa] I told you he'd be back, Anne. Why don't you sit next to him? [Anne, sighing] Louisa. [indistinct] [music continues] - Do come through here. - [Mrs. Croft] Thank you so much. Captain Wentworth, I'm going to keep you next to me. [Frederick] Certainly. Louisa. How perfect. [music stops] [playful instrumental music] - [Louisa] I'll sit next to you. - I'll get your chair. Thank you very much. [people chatting indistinctly] [loud scraping] Light under bushel, check. [people chatting indistinctly] - By the stem? - By the stem. Quite the upgrade. From what? From whoever didn't want to sit next to me. Now, tell me, do you have the same trouble with spoons? Thank you. [Frederick] Thank you. [Louisa] Thank you very much. Enjoying it. It's delicious. [both laugh] Captain Wentworth was telling me how he almost died at sea. My, captain! What made you decide on such a risky profession? When I first left shore, I was in great need of distraction. For that, the constant threat on my life was useful. In fact, I was in such despair, there were times I almost wished for it. Would it be too bold to ask the source of such desperation? A woman. Well, then, her loss. Now, though, I've had my fill of excitement. I long for absolute boredom to lull me back to myself. And by that you mean a wife? Mother! I mean, people and things I can be quiet with, yes. Who better to be quiet with than a wife? Mother! - Are you in the market for a wife, boy? - Father! No, you found me out. Here I am, ashore, looking to make a foolish match. A little kindness, a strong mind, a few compliments to the Navy, and I'm a lost man. Anyone between the ages of 18 and 80 may have me for the asking. [laughter] Almost anyone. Charles wanted to marry me first. [Mrs. Musgrove] What's that, Anne? Um... Uh, just speaking of marriage. Um... [clears throat] Remember how Charles wanted to marry me before he married Charles? I mean Mary. Sorry, Charles, um... Before she married... Sorry, before he, of course he, came to his senses and married Mary. Please go on. You'd like us to understand that your brother-in-law once preferred you to your sister? - That's true, yes. - It's true. Yes, it's quite right. There, there. [soft piano music] Wentworth isn't very gallant to you, Anne. He said you were so altered he hardly recognized you. Don't worry, I stood up for you. I told him your eye got so infected it swelled shut for a week and then we all called you Blackbeard. I suppose that isn't sticking up for you so much as just saying a thing. Yes, I suppose it was more that. [indistinct] More, Anne, please. Play for us, maestro. [soft piano music resumes] [piano fades] [melancholic instrumental music] [Anne] He was so distant last night. I'd prefer open hostility. His cold politeness and ceremonious grace are worse than anything. "Beg your pardon, Miss Elliot, is this your chair?" [screams] Love me, you idiot! Love me or kill me now! I can't bear it! [clears throat] Lady Macbeth. Act three, scene four. She'll buy it. Oh, right. How are you this morning, Mary? I'm still dizzy from watching Wentworth spin Louisa around all evening. Or as much as he could manage with you plonk-plonking sad-sack tunes. "Für Elise" happens to be a great dance song for those sophisticated enough to explore less traditional movements. And how would you dance to Beethoven? Alone in my room with a bottle of red. Frederick will surely propose to Louisa. Then they'll be married and then Louisa will be happy forever. Why must everyone always assume that all women want is to be chosen by any eligible bachelor? Because marriage is the greatest blessing that life can offer. Where are your children? How should I know? Nobody tells you when you're young that life keeps going. It keeps going whether you approve of the progression or not. [sighs] And, eventually, you find yourself wondering, "How did I end up here?" A heartbeat ago, there were no two souls more in rhythm than Wentworth and I. Now we're strangers. Worse than strangers. [sighs] We're exes. [James] Auntie Anne. - Where are you? - Come and play. [kids scream] [romantic instrumental music] Ha! Marie Antoinette, Marie Antoinette, the people don't want you. They don't want to have a queen anymore. How dare you speak to me that way! You are my subjects. Bad queen! Bad queen? Bad subject! - Wait, what's the words again? - Vive la révolution. Vive la revolution! Haha! This is mine. This is my crown. [kids scream] [Anne] How dare you take my crown! - [kids laugh] - [Anne] You got me! - Okay. That's enough! Boys! - Bad queen! - [boys yell] - [Anne] No! That was quite reckless. The boy could have been hurt. You're right. I'm sorry. We got carried away. - Save it for Robespierre. - Frederick! I'm doing my best. Your best? About what? About you and me. I don't want you to be angry. What would you want me to be? [Mary] I'm just too kind, Anne, that's my problem. I give all of my attention to others and then I suffer for it. [in Italian] How far is the Colosseum? Mmm, you're right, but how do I prioritize self-care with everyone around me constantly bidding for my attention? [in Italian] One cappuccino, please! What I've realized is I need to fall in love with myself first, and then I can truly love those around me, and that's all there is to it. Oh! [in Italian] How much is that porcupine in the window? - [Mary] What's behind me? - [in Italian] Cheese roll? Are you trying to go somewhere without me and gesturing to keep it a secret? We are going for a-a walk, Mary. - Very long walk. - Through the woods. - You hate nature. - You hate moving your legs. You made us carry you home last time. So, you assume because I hate something I don't want to do it? Um... [sighs] Great. [insects buzz] [giggling] [Mary] Bugs everywhere. - Anne. - Hmm? There's something I've been meaning to ask you, but I'm ashamed. What is it? You remember when Captain Wentworth first came and I encouraged you to pursue him? Yes. Well, that was before I knew him, of course. And I genuinely hoped that you two would be a match. Not that you seem at all interested. - Don't I? - [Louisa] You barely look at him. And now you'd like him for yourself? He's everything. You seem surprised. I suppose I am. I thought you two were... I don't know how he feels, but I'm falling in love. I've thought quite a lot about how I would feel were our roles reversed. I might be hurt, perhaps even jealous, but I can honestly say that any sorrow for myself would be entirely eclipsed by the pleasure I would take in seeing you happy. - You're trying very hard here. - [Louisa laughs] Is it working? [Anne chuckles] I don't understand why you think you need my permission if you say I barely look at him. Because it's the way you barely look at him. I know what I'm watching and it's more than two people who have merely met. What you're seeing is... the past. Look, I believe this man could be my future. [distant whistle] [melancholic instrumental music] And a frigate is larger than a sloop, correct? - Someone's been studying. - [Frederick] Very good. A sloop is crewed by 130 men or so, while a frigate can carry 140 to 200. Depending on whether it's fifth or sixth rate, I suppose. [Frederick chuckles] "Now May with all her smiling trains of vernal beauty sticks..." That's more than enough poetry. You know how much I detest metaphor. [chuckling] Sorry, Mary, I'd forgotten. My mind is like a sieve. Which is a simile, not a metaphor. Fine. My mind is a sieve. Whatever your mind is, stop using words imaginatively. I can't bear it. [Henrietta] Look! We could drop in on Harry Hayter. Perhaps he's worked up the nerve to propose to me. Not that I had any intention for leading us in this direction. No, absolutely not. I will not enter the Hayter house. I'm sure to contract some terrible illness. Mary, don't be ridiculous. Is it ridiculous to care for one's health? Households employing fewer than five servants are unsanitary. Please don't judge us by our poor relations, captain. It's unpleasant having such connections. Just to be clear, you disapprove of him for your sister-in-law because he is not wealthy enough? [Mary] I know. It really is awful, isn't it? Shall we? [ducks quacking] [playful instrumental music] [Louisa] It's that Elliot pride. I find it detestable. To know Sir Walter, one might believe the title of Baronet second only to King. Lord knows how sweet Anne came out of that lot. We all so wish Charles had married her instead. Don't you agree? - Don't let her fool you. - What do you mean? Anne Elliot has as much pride as the rest. It just takes a different form. I don't understand. Next time you witness Miss Elliot quietly installing herself on the outskirts of some social situation, consider whether she might assume this vantage in order to judge everyone. Harshly. Anne Elliot is pure kindness. You don't know her like I do. You are the one who is pure kindness, Louisa, and for this reason you always assume the best of others. The truest evidence of an inferior mind is to allow oneself to be persuaded away from one's deepest convictions. [Louisa] What deepest convictions? I won't have you speak ill of Anne. She is too dear to me. I don't know what happened between you and I'm not asking. I do see the best in her, and I implore you to look for it too. Please forgive me. I've been too harsh. Thank you for calling me to task. If I forgive you, will you teach me how to read a sextant? - [Frederick] On such short acquaintance? - I'm free this evening. [both laugh] [Frederick] Shall we wander? [slow playful music] [sighs] [music stops] There's nothing worse than thinking your life is ruined and then realizing you've got much, much further to fall. [music resumes] Like I said. - [birds cawing] - [Anne groans softly] [sighs deeply] [indistinct chatter] [Mrs. Croft] How lovely to see you. - She's injured. - Shall I ask her? Anne? Anne, may we offer you a ride home? - Thank you. I'm quite all right. - Anne, you've clearly hurt your foot. It's hardly ten minutes out of our way. Please, come. You're so kind. And I'm so enjoying the fresh air. Must you be so proud? Please, let this be easy. [sighs] [slow melancholic music] [kids screaming] James. Come here. I need a favor from you. Do you think you can help? I need you to hug me so tightly that I can't feel my body anymore. - Do you think you can do that? - Mm-hmm. [Anne exhales slowly] James, tea time. Anne. Anne, we are going to Lyme. Tomorrow. It's been decided. We'll spend the night by the sea. To Lyme? Why? Captain Wentworth wants us to meet some of his Navy friends. - I'm not quite up for a trip, I'm afraid. - What? Anne, we're going to Lyme tomorrow. I need 24 hours away from the terrors. No, wait. Mary, I'm not... No. You're always out to ruin my fun and I won't have it. I need a holiday, and I need you with me to have someone to talk at when the others stop feeling obligated. Shockingly self-aware. [pensive instrumental music] [seagulls crying] [waves lapping] [Henrietta laughs] [indistinct chatter] Captain, this is Anne Elliot. Anne Elliot. Captain Harville. Pleasure to meet you. Please excuse me. Now, you are a fan of poetry. Or is that just a rumor? You seem to know more of me than I can hardly be comfortable with. Forgive me, I'm just hatching a plot. - You see our friend over there? - Yes. [Harville] Captain Benwick. Now, Captain Benwick has also considerable taste in reading. But he has fallen into a sadness. I wondered if you might take a moment to talk to him? I can build a house out of driftwood, but don't ever ask me about the Greeks. [Anne laughs] What's the source of his sorrow? Home from Troy and there's another man in his bed? [laughs] Sorry, Agamemnon joke. He was engaged to my sister Fanny. And they were very much in love. And she died while he was at sea, just before they were set to be married. I'm so sorry. They say the universe always has a plan. [Anne sighs] - [Harville] So, will you? Speak to him. - I'd be happy to. Though I'm not sure I'm the messenger the universe has in mind. Trust me, it's never wrong. All that is meant for one is meant to find one. I promise. [Frederick laughs] [indistinct chatter] And while you're at it, convince our friend Wentworth that he'd be a fool to ignore the Navy much longer. - I hate to see a talent wasted. - [laughs] If only I had influence. Tonight at dinner? You get him drunk. I'll smuggle him aboard. Perhaps you should ask Louisa. I'm asking you. Shall we? [Harville] Not tempted to have a dip in the water, are you? Thank you. Promise? Come on, Mary. [laughter] Wentworth, of course, refused to admit that he had got the coordinates wrong. Captain Wentworth is very stubborn. Stubborn indeed. He could be an admiral some day, great service to the Crown and all that it holds dear, but instead he'd rather fart around inland for the rest of his life. Oh, let the man fart where he likes. I would like to have a family one day. As you well know, the wife of a sailor pays a tax for her husband's chosen path. It is but a small fee. Constant worry. I'd hate to ask that of anyone. That's ridiculous. No life is without worry. Harville is right. Anne. Your future wife will be perfectly capable of managing her own feelings. Don't patronize her by deciding for her what worries she can and cannot endure. Who knows? Perhaps she'll even be forging her own adventures at home. [Harville] Right, who wants more wine? [Henrietta] Yes. Yes. - Yeah? Okay, good. - Yes. Yes. [people chat indistinctly] [Anne] Lord Byron. "She was my life's unerring light." "That quench'd, what beams shall break my night." Yes. [sighs] He's got me through a self-pitying night or two. I often think it is the great misfortune of poetry that it's seldom enjoyed safely by those capable of enjoying it completely. Only people who know loss can really appreciate Byron. But those people should only taste him sparingly. Otherwise, they'll be left more deeply in their sorrow. - Then, what are those people meant to do? - [Anne chuckles] Honestly, I've been trying to work that out for eight years now. I can only tell you what I must repeat to myself daily. You're young. You don't know what the future has in store. You will rally, and you will be happy again. - Perhaps you're right. - [Anne] I know I am. - Thank you, Miss Elliot. - [chuckles] [seagull crying] [romantic instrumental music] I'm only saying, the lower ranks are taxed disproportionately. [playful music] - [Louisa] Who is that? - Pardon me. I think I'm in your way. Perhaps you can correct that. Perhaps. Hello. Can I help you with something? Considering what I'd like help with, probably not. [Frederick] Hmm. [music stops] Hello. Hello. - I'm sorry about this morning. - What happened this morning? I'm speaking of that rude gentleman we encountered. I'm not your older brother. You don't need my protection. In any event, you've never had trouble speaking for yourself. [chuckles] No apology necessary. It was clearly well intended. Look, we haven't really had a chance to talk. I've lived with a thousand different imagined versions of you over the years. Some to rail against. Some to cherish. Likewise. I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. Or if you knew how much I cared. I think I always knew. There's no one quite like you. And it's clear to me that I want you in my life. No matter what form that takes. Bury the past and... I suppose what I'm getting at is, um... I... I would like to be friends. [melancholic instrumental music] I was... I was thinking the same. I saw so clearly this morning the prison my resentment had created. I genuinely hope you find love wherever you need to find it. And I thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your offer of friendship. Thank you. Thank you. Well... Excellent. Good... talk. [Anne] I really do hope you'll be open to pursuing the admiralty. Everyone speaks to your genius. I'm sure they understate it. They don't really know who I am or what would make me happy. Well, I do. I know you. And I know you want a life of consequence. And I know you'd be brilliant. - You want to know a secret? - Always. [both chuckle] My most grim moments at sea, when I felt completely lost and confused and inadequate, I would ask myself, "What would Anne do here?" That's how I'd know how to proceed. Pretending I was you. - You lie. - I truth. You're always best in an emergency. Anticipating the needs of others. Direct and focused, calm and thoughtful. Equipped with more intelligence than does you good. No, you're an exceptional person. It angers me the world denies you the chance of a public life. You'd make a great admiral. Thanks. Don't go out too far. There's riptides and such. Sorry. There I go trying to protect you again. As you were. [Anne chuckles] Now we're worse than exes. We're friends. [melancholic music] [music continues] [music stops] Now you are in my way. - Excuse me. - Before you go, allow me a proper introduction. Or is your minder waiting round the corner to tell me off again? He's my friend, and I believe he misconstrued your intentions. My intentions were construed most accurately. I intended for you to notice me. Miss? Miss. - Simple. I like it. - Mm-hmm. Will I see you again? We must entrust that to providence. That means I haven't yet made up my mind. What? What is it, Anne? [Anne] The man we passed yesterday. Excuse me. Can you tell me the name of the gentleman who just left? That's Mr. William Walter Elliot, miss, en route to Bath. Of course he drives off just as I get to the window. - A cousin? - Not just a cousin, Henrietta. Our father's heir. We should write to Father at once. That news would not be welcome, Mary, as well you know. - [Mary] He'll be furious. - [Henrietta] What happened between them? - My father and Mr. Elliot do not speak. - [gasps] - I love a little bit of family gossip. - [Louisa] Tell us. Mr. Elliot will inherit the baronetcy and the estate no matter what. Father was desperate that he marry Elizabeth to keep the title within his direct line. [Anne] But he turned her down. We learned that he had married an American woman who nobody knew. Father threw a platter of canapés across the room. - Wasn't Mr. Elliot in mourning clothes? - His wife's dead. You must hate him for all the embarrassment he's caused your family. Actually, so far it's his most winning quality. [romantic instrumental music] He's a lucky man to have met Louisa. Hmm. Has he said anything to you about how he feels? No, she has. [woman] It's quite steep. Careful. [Louisa laughs] Thank you. Do be careful. - Catch me, Captain. - [Frederick] Oh, goodness. - [Louisa laughs] - [Frederick] Oh. [both laugh] Okay, that was your warm-up. Once more. No, Louisa, that's enough. No more. I'm jumping, so either catch me or don't. - Louisa! - No, no, no, no. - Louisa! - [Anne] No. Don't move her. Louisa? Can you hear me? Uh, we need a doctor. I'll go. No, someone who knows the town. Benwick, get a doctor. - Hurry! - [Anne] Louisa. - Anne, tell me what can I do? - Just be patient. [Anne] She's still breathing. It's all right, she's breathing. [doctor] She's had quite a severe concussion. But I've seen far greater injuries recovered from. There's reason to be hopeful. - Leave her to rest now. - [Mrs. Harville] Yes. - [doctor] She can stay here? - Of course. No, you've been so kind, we can't continue to impose. She'll stay as long as she needs. Whoever doesn't mind a spot on the floor is welcome to stay with her. Anne should stay. To assist you, Mrs. Harville. No one so capable, so perfect as Anne. - You will stay, won't you? - Of course. I can't bear to leave until she's awake. [Frederick] I'll deliver news to the Musgroves. - Thank you. - Thank you. Would you be so kind as to escort Mary and Henrietta? Escort me? The children, Mary. We can't have them stay with my parents an extra night. Nearly burned the house down last time. Why should Anne stay? Anne who means nothing to Louisa. - Oh, Mary. - It was my understanding, Mary, that you suffered from an allergy to houses of fewer than five servants. Aren't you worried you'll contract something? I'm not leaving. Have a good journey, Anne. [sorrowful instrumental music] It's not your fault. You told her not to leap. In words, yes. - But in other ways... - In other ways? I led her to believe I was a person who was prepared to catch her. How exactly did you do that? I knew she was infatuated and yet did nothing to discourage her. Clearly, it led to this. Had this not occurred, one can only imagine what our lives might have been. Now I'm responsible for her. How do I tell her parents? Calmly. Be direct. Offer whatever services they may require of you. [sorrowful music continues] Good luck. What will you do now? I need to go to Bath. Thank you. For everything. [sorrowful music continues] How is it that life can remain static, almost obstinately resistant to any change for years at a time, and then... without warning become flooded with so much newness within the course of a few weeks? It's impossible to recall life before the torrents. [Lady Russell] That poor girl. How are her parents? [Anne] In shock, but trying to stay hopeful. [Lady Russell] Well, that's all they can do. Now, where are they? Where are they? - It's fine, we don't need them. - [sighs] I wanted it to be perfect for you. Don't be silly, I'm happy just to be here with you. No, no, no. It's not a picnic without macaroons. [Anne chuckles] Henry would have thrown a fit if they'd forgotten to pack the dessert. Well, lucky for you, I don't really care for macaroons. - Hmm. - And I'm not Henry. No. Nobody is. Do you ever think about spending time with someone else? Several men have offered. Do you know whose company I enjoy? My own. There's a reason widowed men die soonest and unmarried women live longest. We're great company. But do you ever miss... company? [chuckles] Why do you think I take so many European tours? Lady Russell! [Lady Russell laughs] Shh. [playful instrumental music] I hope I haven't eaten too much. There's sure to be a feast tonight. We're to meet the famous Mr. Elliot. But why is he courting Father's favor now? Well, Elizabeth, of course, assumes it is she who motivates him with all of her charms. Mr. Elliot has nothing to gain from my father. He is richer than him and will inherit his title no matter what. - He must be after something. - Why are you so suspicious of him? Because anyone that attractive must have an angle. - What are you keeping from me? - I've seen Mr. Elliot. And he's attractive. Very attractive. You met him? In Lyme, though neither of us knew who we were meeting. - Do I sense a romance brewing? - That's not going to happen. - Because? - Because he is a ten. I never trust a ten. Oh! [Lady Russell] This is you. [bells ringing] [Anne] This is his idea of downsizing? [Lady Russell] It's a start. Don't make me. Courage, ma chérie. I'll see you tonight. [playful instrumental music] - Anne! I'm so happy to see you. - What do you mean by that? Mr. Elliot is on his way and I want him to see what I look like next to you. - It's good to be home. - Just think. He's been nursing a crush on me for nearly a decade. Poor man. How he must have suffered. All the way through a marriage he ran away from you to secure. Isn't it mad? He must have presumed I was out of his league. I can't imagine any other reason. I'm never quite sure whether you're insulting me, but I value your regard so little that I don't mind either way. Ah, Anne. Is that what you're wearing? Mr. Elliot will be here any moment. I was surprised, Father, to learn how forgiving you've been after all he made you suffer. Suffer? Well, there were many insults. He denies making them. Father, he made them to you. He was very strong in his denial. [knock on door] Oh, that's him. Get the door, Anne. And don't slouch. Hurry up! Gosh. [sighs] Thank you. Ah. It seems like providence plays for my team after all. I'm your cousin, Anne. Cousin? Interesting. It's a decided step up from passerby, but still a bit short of "most beloved". But I am willing to work for my titles. Imagine my luck, a flirt and a hard worker. Don't forget rich. Lucky we have you to remind us. What in God's name is happening? Don't worry, darling, he's just practicing on me. Shall we? [piano music] [piano music in the room] [clears his throat] I understand you've been visiting my sister quite often. She is delighted by the attention. Well, it's nice to hear that your sister is capable of delight. But romance has been the last thing from my mind. Until today. [laughs] Well, if you haven't been coming for the purpose of courtship, then... - [Elliot] Mrs. Clay, of course. - Mrs. Clay? About a month ago, I received word that my uncle had appeared in Bath in the company of a woman of low birth. Many presumed she was after his hand. Now, that marriage would be a scandal. You're concerned for my father's reputation? Oh, no, not at all. My concern is that he will have a son and that son will rob me of my title and my estate. And my plan is to block that by any means necessary. I told you, I'm willing to work for my titles. [Anne chuckles] I have to say, I am impressed by your openness. Refreshing, yes? I'm so glad to see you again. I heard about that terrible accident that befell your party after I left Lyme. How is she? She's still confined to her bed, but much recovered. I received word this morning. Thank you for asking. - You must have suffered terribly. - I suffered the least, truly. You have a gentle soul. You feel deeply for those around you. I imagine it was quite an ordeal. I regret you had to go through it. Thank you. [piano stops] [guests applaud] So good, darling. Mm. - Go forth. You have my blessing. - I wouldn't do anything without it. [chuckles] - Bravo! - Bravo! [Elliot] Bravo. Very well played, madam. He means to disarm me with candor. It isn't working. [chuckles] Yet. Probably won't. Right? Ow. [munches] [Sir Walter hums] [screams] - What? - Joy. Pardon me, I'm experiencing joy. The dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter, the honorable Miss Carteret, are in Bath. [squealing] Do you rehearse this stuff while I'm sleeping? Our dear cousins! Cousins? I love cousins! Cousin is a term most accurately applied to those within one's family tree, not those within one's family forest. The Dalrymples don't have the slightest notion that we exist. With the help of a few visual aids, I bet we could explain the connections most comprehensively within three quarters of an hour. - But why? - [Sir Walter] Why? These people are nobility. Everyone will want to be seen with them. What's the advantage of being seen with them? Anne, don't be deliberately dense. Quick! Break out your finest frocks. We are about to touch... greatness. [silence] [clock ticking in the room] [bird cooing outside] [teaspoon clinking] [birds chirping] [slurps] Sometimes, I have this dream that a giant octopus is sucking my face and, as I struggle to get free, I realize that my, my hands are tentacles and I can't push it off. And then I realize, of course, that I am the octopus, and I am sucking my own face. [ticking continues] Much like in life. So often those we perceive as our greatest adversaries are just shadow versions of ourselves. Well put, Mr. Elliot. Hmm. Perhaps the next time you meet an octopus, Miss Elliot, you should embrace him, rather than try to detach. Wrap those wily tendrils right around him and let yourself be taken. [chuckles] In your dreams, Mr. Elliot. And also in mine. It was on account of eating some cheese a bit too close to bedtime. - Oh. - Well, that went splendidly. I knew it would. [laughs] Your charms are irresistible, Sir Walter, even to nobility. [laughs] Your noble relations disappoint you. [sighs] That awful woman cannot marry your father. Ugh. [Anne] Tell me something. You'd honestly rather prevent Mrs. Clay from taking my father's arm than talk with me? My dear octopus, it's not even close. You know... you're beginning to grow on me. Now I'm suspicious. [playful instrumental music] [Elliot] Fascinating. [Lady Russell giggles] Must everyone be interesting? [Anne] Not at all. They are free to be as boring as they like so long as I am not asked to sit with them. And him? [Anne chuckles] He provided some relief. More than I anticipated. [Lady Russell] Hmm. He spoke quite highly of you to me the other night. I believe there is some attachment. Mr. Elliot could attach to a potato if it suited him. Though Elizabeth may find some satisfaction living at home forever, that life will lock you in deadness. All I'm saying is, I hope you will accept Mr. Elliot if he makes an offer. Based on your extensive knowledge of him? I may not have extensive knowledge of him, but I have extensive knowledge of you. Not only is he rich and well-mannered, I believe you've taken an interest in him. I would never have recommended it otherwise. I'll admit, there is something there. But, for once, I'm asking you to trust that I have the resources to make my own decisions. I must rely on the instructions issued by my own heart. I tried the alternative once and I'll never forgive myself for it. You mean you'll never forgive me. I just thought, under the circumstances... Circumstances? [Lady Russell] The engagement, of course. Wentworth and Louisa. Oh, I thought you knew. Everyone is talking about Louisa and her captain. Oh, darling. What can I do? [exhales] I'd just like to be alone. Well, I'm here when you want me. [sorrowful instrumental music] [music continues] [shuddering breaths] I always imagined myself confronting this moment with grace. I would astonish myself and others with my... My quiet dignity. My ability to endure. Statues would be erected in my name. "In memory of Anne Elliot, who suffered cosmic loss yet really held it together quite impressively." [sighs] [music builds] [music slows down, then stops] Mm. Anne. - You're here. - Yes, it appears I am. - Are you alone? - Mm. I'm just waiting for a friend. I see. We got caught in the rain. He's gone to fetch a carriage. He's quite charming. - Well, I'm pleased to hear that. - He makes me laugh. It's nice to laugh. [laughs] Apparently, you've yet to hear about the engagement. I'm... I'm sorry, the horses were a nightmare in the rain. - Uh, Mr. Elliot, allow me to introduce... - We remember each other. We do. [Elliot] Mm. [exhales] Th-this is Captain Wentworth. Yes, your good friend Captain Wentworth. I'm glad to have the opportunity to, uh, apologize for my behavior in Lyme. It was on account of being struck by this dazzling creature. Please don't call me a creature. This dazzling, um... [Anne] Woman? Woman? - What's wrong with creature? - We'll talk about it later. What is taking you two so long? Um, just one second. One second. There's a concert tomorrow. Will you join us? - Oh, I'd hate to intrude. - On what? You'll come, then. Excellent. We'll be a foursome. You, she, the bel canto and me. He's quite original, isn't he? Unique, even. It's good to see you happy. Thanks. I hope you're happy too. Anne, I think we should be going. I'll see you tomorrow. [Elizabeth] Anne! Hurry up! [melancholic music builds] [overlapping chatter] [quiet laughter in the room] Good evening. Shall we? How's Louisa? Very much recovered. And yet still healing slowly. It's going to take time and love to see her through. Good. So long as you're in Bath, I hope we can see a bit of one another. I'm actually not sure how long I'll be here. I'm in the throes of a difficult decision. Been offered a position aboard a ship. Oh. She sets sail for Malta Saturday, so I don't have long to make up my mind. - Well, that sounds exciting. - Indeed it does. I love my work and I'm happy for the opportunity to serve, but... I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to steal my Anne for a moment. Fluent in Italian too, would you believe it? - Uh, we need help translating the program. - Just one moment. Anne, we need you to do Italian for our cousins. I do hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding. Anne would be devastated if you weren't there. I know how much she values your friendship. [stringed music] [indistinct chatter] [sings in Italian] [door opens] [door closes] [singing continues] Frederick! I was hoping we could continue our conversation. Sadly, I'm not sure there will be another opportunity. I've just made up my mind. I'm off to sea. Much to put in order before Saturday. I'm sorry, I'm interrupting again. No, no, no. I'm afraid it is I who is interrupting. Enjoy the second act. [Mr. Elliot] We will. - I didn't mean to upset... - If you would just let me speak. You interrupted me. Let me say what's on my mind first. I'm new to these genuine feelings. I'm trying to learn from you, for you. You're far too good for me and I'm terrified. But I want very much to make you my wife. Nothing else would make me happier. - Your wife? - Yes. You don't have to answer now. But please, think on it. [music and singing continue] The captain was right, you know. [music and singing continue] The gentleman is indeed unique. [music and singing fade] [loud knock on door] Ow. Charles, hurry up! Ow. Ow. [Mary groans] The journey gave me dead leg. I need you to massage it. Mary, what are you doing here? Uh, coming to fetch you, of course. You need to come to the inn with Charles and me to listen to me talk. We're here for a little visit. Ever since Louisa's accident, life just seems so fragile and fleeting. It's made me realize how important it is to spend time away from one's children. And it's dreadfully unfair that you and Elizabeth are up here gallivanting with Mr. Elliot and our noble cousins and I haven't even been introduced to them yet, despite being the most accomplished decoupage artist of the three of us. Hmm? Oh, Anne, have you heard? Louisa will marry a sailor and Henrietta that soiled napkin of a curate, Henry Hayter. Mary, remember your list. Oh, right. My doctor thinks I might benefit from embodying gratitude. So every time something terrible happens in my life, I'm to think up something I'm glad for. For example, the fact that both my sisters are madly in love and about to be married? No, that does nothing for me. Well, I'm delighted for them both. And I will come and visit later. - Where are you going? - [Anne] Um... I have plans. What plans? Upstairs? You don't even have any friends and all your relations are in this house. I hate to agree with my wife, Anne, but I've been given explicit instructions not to return to the inn without you. It'll be a little Lyme reunion. Captain Harville was quite charmed by you and delighted for the prospect of renewing your acquaintance. He's gone to fetch Wentworth just now. How unfortunate you have other plans. [indistinct chatter] Anne. I've missed you. [Harville] We need to give Wentworth a proper send-off. [Charles] Absolutely. A few drinks, a game of cards. Although I understand Anne has other plans. I'm no card player. Worst I've ever seen. That was then. Time makes many changes. I'm not yet so much changed. Wentworth, sorry to interrupt but I will not rest until that letter is signed and delivered to Admiral Croft. You've been very slippery these past few months. Of course. Are we finished? I suppose so. I'll be just a moment. You look a bit sad, Captain Harville. Well, actually, I should be happy. Captain Benwick has found love at last. That's wonderful. I should think you would be pleased. You were so determined to see him out of his misery. But I hadn't anticipated the effect it would have on me. It's as if his suffering was keeping my sister alive somehow. Poor Fanny. She would never have forgotten him so soon. Well, that's certain. We women do not forget you so soon as you forget us. Women love beyond all sensible limits. We cannot help ourselves. I don't mean to venture any claims about the differences between men and women. [Anne] Oh, well, I will. The only privilege I claim for my sex is that of loving longest. Loving even when hope is gone. Loving because you don't have a choice. - [Frederick] I'm finished. - [Harville] Thank you. [chuckles] There is no quarreling with you. I think Fanny would be happy to see her Benwick cared for. [Harville] Fanny was never the jealous type. In moments I've wondered if it wasn't my sister's spirit in the wind that caused Louisa to slip, knowing somehow eventually where she would land. Louisa? I've told you, the universe has perfect timing. And when you had the presence of mind to tell Benwick to fetch a surgeon, you must have had no idea the wheels that you were setting in motion. Captain, I'm afraid I'm lost. I'm speaking of Louisa's engagement to Captain Benwick, of course. A love grown slow and sure from his constant attention to her during her convalescence. Of what did you think I was speaking? I don't know. [Harville] I'll make sure this letter gets to Admiral Croft. "Dear Anne..." [soft instrumental music] "...I can listen no longer in silence." "Anne, you pierce my soul." "Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death." "I am half agony, half hope." "I know you are to marry Mr. Elliot, but I will never forgive myself if I do not tell you this." "You alone have brought me to Bath." [gasps] "For you alone I think and plan." "But of course you have not seen this. How could you?" "Because your love has not lasted as long as mine." "Anne... I have loved no one but you." "And I don't think I ever will." [music rises] Anne. - I can explain... - I wish you both every happiness. [laughs] [Frederick] "I have thought many times about how to tell you, but the pain of a love unrequited rendered me silent." "Tell me not that I am too late." Frederick! [Frederick] "My love for you has never faltered."
