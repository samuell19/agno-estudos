During the sixties, the economic slump... and rampant corruption within the police force... and led to much injustice. Chinese Midnight Express Ahn, you're my idol. More and more readers are writing in to support you. They're not supporting me. They're supporting righteousness. You're only a reporter. Righteousness is none of your business. If you want to uphold justice, be a lawyer or a cop instead. Uncle Chien, there are two kinds of people in this world. Those who shouldn't be corrupt, yet they're the most corrupt. Cops and lawyers for example. If you mingle with them, you'll be forced to be corrupt. How will we uphold justice? You're a very daring young man. You're always exposing the cops for taking bribes. Sooner or later you'll get into trouble. —We'll see. —Ahn! —Chief. —The newspapers were sold out... once they hit the streets. The readers rushed to read your article. Our paper has been the best-seller for the last three months. All thanks to you. I'm only doing what a reporter should do. Ahn, continue the good work. I'm counting on you. Thanks, Chief. Ahn, you can't go on like that. If you keep on writing this... you better ask your mom to pray to the gods for your well-being. She may as well become a vegetarian and pray real hard for you. This is no joke. I'm just writing the truth. I have nothing to hide. Why should I be afraid? Wow, three A's and one B. You filled it in yourself? Of course not. So you'll get into university for sure. He's been excited over this for half a day. I asked him to call you up, but he said there was no need. He wanted to give you a surprise. Let's eat out to celebrate. It's a waste of money to eat out. I've made chicken soup. Let's all eat at home. I'll see to the soup. Smart guy! Brother. Thanks. Don't mention it. I'm glad you can enter university. From now on get good grades... as well as scholarships, then I won't have to work so hard. So you're giving me pressure to study hard. Okay... the chicken soup is ready. Lok, burn some incense for you father, and tell him about your results. Go on. Ahn, someone has sent you a package. To Mr Chin Ahn That's a lot of money. Ahn, who sent you the watch and money? No idea. There is no name or note inside. If there's no reason for the gifts, then you mustn't accept them. Brother, it's for you. —Who is it? —I don't know. —Hello. —Ahn, right? Speaking. Consider the watch and $5,000 a small token of thanks. Stop writing those things in the newspaper. You want to bribe me? Who are you? You'll be rewarded for being smart. If not, then you better watch out. So you're threatening... Where's the photo you've just taken of me? Give it to me. That photo can't be developed. It's in my brain. Then I have to crack open your head to take it. —Okay. —Jess. Let me introduce someone to you. This is Inspector Chiang Yiu Joe of West Point District. He came all the way to see you. Miss Tsai, you sang really well. I really loved it. Let me introduce you to my boyfriend. I know him. He's the famous reporter, Mr Chin Ahn. I know his articles are really something. Whatever he writes about me is always ground-breaking. My articles are rather simple, but some people do appreciate them. To the point where they would send me a watch and money. You don't seem to like the gift from me. Many people want your gifts, but I'm not interested. It's okay if you're not interested as long as someone else is. Miss Tsai, I feel happy after listening to your singing tonight. I'll treat you to a late supper. Sorry, I'm very tired tonight. You heard that, right? My girlfriend said she's very tired. Let's go. Bloody fool, he probably has a death wish. Look, you wrote this and you got me into a mess! Boss called up and nailed me to the wall. He said I hired a lousy reporter. Also, the Police PR called up. They said you slandered Chiang Yiu Joe, and hurt the police's image. So now they're suing our paper! What I wrote was the truth. Let them sue us. Let them sue us? I'm the chief here. So you want me to be the scapegoat? Young man, one must be righteous enough to face the world! Here is your next month's pay. Go find another job! You better watch out! It's okay. You get a gold watch just by talking to me. You're right. One must be righteous enough to face the world. Ahn, what's your next move? I haven't thought about it. I've been in this field for years. I have friends around. If you need help, just let me know. Thanks for the offer. I'll come to you if I need help. However, I won't let this go. I'll continue exposing their dirty corruption. Ahn, everyone wants to become a hero... but not everyone can afford the price of becoming a hero. Even if you could, you would be wounded all over. Thanks, Uncle Chien. I'll be careful. Goodbye. What are you doing? Why are you digging everything out? Stop! We don't have such things in our home! We're law-abiding citizens! Stop searching! Mom, what is it? Son, they say we're hiding heroin! —Hey, what evidence do you have? —Have you found anything? Brother! Oh, I recognize you. You're Chiang Yiu Joe's boy. Don't mess around here! We have a warrant. Everything's by the book. Kid, you're in serious trouble. Wan, we found something. —What is this? —Son. I saw him take this stuff out from his pocket! Old hag, what did you say? —Mom! —Don't move! Stand up! What? You're treating him so well? Take good care of him for me. Got it, Boss. Die! Scumbag! Scumbag! You assaulted an officer? To heck with you! You better admit it. I would rather die than to admit it! I can kill you easily. I'll tell everyone you tried to run away. But I won't let you off so easily. Boss, a call for you. Look, you made him so dirty. Go give him a good bath. —Move it! Go for a bath! —Time to wash yourself! Hello. Oh, Miss Tsai. What made you call me? Really? I'm not aware of it. Move it! Maybe my men arrested him. Okay... Since you say so, I'll surely help him. But I'm very busy now. I'll have my men take you to my home for a chat tonight. You all know I'm innocent! Let me go! You're framing me! I'll never confess! Kill me if you dare! It's no problem to release you. Just make these soap disappear. You're tough, but your brother is weak. We roughed him up a little and broke a couple of his ribs Your mother was worse off. I raised my voice a little and she just passed out. Don't move! Stand still! It's okay that you frame me, but leave my mother and brother alone! Are you afraid now? I'll ask you again. Will you confess? I have no time to fool around with you. Charge all three of them! I'll confess! Boss, Miss Tsai is here. Joe, please do me a favour and spare Ahn. Why isn't the money from the drugs and gambling dens of Triangle Pier here? Right, Boss. Fatty said he'll send it to us later. Were you talking to me? Yes, Joe, please do me a favour and spare Ahn. I don't understand. You're a smart girl. Why do you stick to someone who sells drugs? He wouldn't sell drugs. There must be a misunderstanding. You're so naive. You don't see the police finding drugs in my place. He's in so much trouble. He'll serve three to five years. Joe, please help him. How can I? There are too many people who need help. Let alone he got himself into such a big mess. Joe, please do me a favour. Please take this money. Silly girl, I have lots of money. I can even give you some if you're short of money. Joe, what must I do for you to help me? You. I want you. I can't do it! You can't, but I can. Think about it. It's a one-for-three deal. It's a bargain. My men were really rough. I couldn't even recognise him. —Joe... —What now? Yes or no? Don't say I won't help you. If you're willing, then take off your clothes. Take them off! Take off the skirt too. Go on. Go on to the bed. Move it. Hurry up. —Boss is having a good time. —He's lucky. Don't say I don't treat you well. Go upstairs. —Great! —Let's go... I always believed there was justice in this world. But with what happened to me, how could I not confess? Mom is old and she's always ill. Lok has just finished post-secondary school. I confessed, because I didn't want them to suffer. However, my confession got me three years of imprisonment. Plus six rattan strokes for assaulting police officers. Besides the physical abuse, I also have to spend three years in prison. I can only say, the world is full of darkness. Evil has triumphed over righteousness. There has never been justice in this world. The law is just a game. And this game is the beginning of a nightmare. Get off! Stand still! Two by two! Stand still! Sit still! Stand up! Collect, sir! Sir, these are the new inmates. You thugs, listen carefully. I didn't send you here. It's the judge who sent you here. I guarantee you'll be safe if you don't stir up trouble. If you make trouble, I guarantee you'll definitely not be safe. You can get medicine if you're seriously ill... but you must cure yourself if it's a minor disease. Got it? Thugs! Everybody sit down! Answer when you're called! Chiang Chia Tung, are you here? —Present. —Come out! You're back so soon? Yes, Sergeant. I left here and looked for a job, but no one wanted me. I had no money, so I admitted to robbery and came back. I got paid, so I'm back. The judge is blind. How can you rob when you can't even walk properly? Strip for the body cavity search. Chin Ahn! What is your name? —Chin Ahn. —What are you in for? Drug possession and assaulting police officers. Take off all your clothes! Turn around and let me see. Your number is 13259. What number is it? 13259. You've been sentenced to three years... and six rattan-strokes. You'll get caned when the number is called. Go for the cavity search. Stick to your group. If not, then don't walk around. Go to your gang if you have one. You're new here? What are you in for? I used to be a reporter. Because I exposed the corruption of an inspector... of West Point District, I was framed and sent here. A reporter? Should we rough him up? Of course, he's a newcomer! —Okay, we'll each give him three. —Okay. I'll give him three then. —Shepherd, collect your man. —Here! You're done, Brother Dog? Show him the ropes or I'll treat you to Ovaltine. Don't worry, I'll teach him well. Don't worry... —How much will you bet? —Whatever you say. Whose turn is it now? Have you ever been arrested? So this means it's your first time. Now, there are rules in prison. You're a newbie, so you're the sheep. I'm a shepherd. That means I'm your boss. No matter what, do whatever I say. Don't make your own decisions. Don't ever make trouble, or those bosses will treat me to Ovaltine. That's nice. You're really dumb and stupid! You think it's real Ovaltine? It's a mixture of faeces and urine! Also, we shepherds are different from those triad members. Those triad members are protected and we're not. So we work a lot, but we don't get any reward. Do you understand? Then don't complain. By the way, what is your name? —Chin Ahn. —Ahn, my name is Plane. Just call me Brother Plane from now on. What? Is it so funny? Is my name lousy? You think it's easy for me to get this nickname? You smell of sweat. Squat here for a while. It'll be bathing time soon. Prison is a place for all kinds of people. I mean the evil kind. I expected I'd be bullied and beaten up. The reality is actually much worse than I could imagine. Go on. What are you doing? I can't undo the knot. Go away. Weirdo. Smooth skin. What are you doing? I can do anything I want. Hold him down! Hey, don't do anything rash! To heck with you! Is the party just for you people? Why can't we? You can join us if you want! We won't join you, but we'll watch you play. —Come on! —What are you doing? —Go on and play! —Do it! What's the matter? So you want to watch me perform! Go on! —Do it! —I will! Move aside! You're not really gonna watch me do it, right? What are you doing? You're having a party? Nothing. —Sir... —Hey! Ahn, why are you so careless? You slipped again? Sorry, sir. He slipped again. —He's really okay? —He's fine. He only slipped. Right? —Is that true? —Sir... He's fine... he only slipped. Just be careful next time. Sorry, sir, I'm sorry... Be careful next time! —Yes, of course... —Call for me if you need help. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. What's wrong with you? You wanted to rat them out? You must think about me even if you're not scared to die. Tomorrow they'll be angry at me for not putting a leash on you. What? You can't get over this? This is life. Do you know why we're called sheep? Just like those poor sheep we are to be bitten by wolves. I don't know how I'll survive three years here. You're already here. Though it's bad to be in prison, three years is not a long time. At most you'll spend two years here. Then you can leave. If what you say is true, ten years is not long either. Go and change your clothes. I'll teach you a few things. Answer at once if the officers call you. Don't go over if fellow inmates call you. Admit to it if you've made a mistake. Stand still when anyone beats you. Be alert when you see the officers. Be careful when you see the bosses. Keep this in mind and remember it at all times. Also, because you're the newbie, you'll be the Pee-boy tonight. What's a Pee-boy? I'll tell you. Pee-boy... Pee-boy! Hey! Ahn! Hey, Pee-boy. Get going. Squat properly. Don't wiggle your butt. It's really uncomfortable without underwear. You call this uncomfortable? Wait till it's summer... and you'll be like a sausage in a hotdog bun. Three-legs, you don't look too good. Looks like something bad will happen to you. Go to hell. Know why he's known as Three-legs? Why? It's because his manhood is really huge. It looks like he has three legs when he's in the squatting position. Who the heck did that? Three-legs... we told you something bad would happen. Be quiet... Ahn, the guy with the two stars on his shoulder is called Psycho. And the one behind him is his helper, Sappy. You must be careful when you confront them. Listen to the number for rattan strokes! 13259. Here! Come out! Squat down. 13259, come in! Come in. 13259, you've been sentenced to six strokes. You're 130 pounds. The rattan should be 4.2 cm. Take off your clothes and pants, and go over there! It's really painful after being beaten with rattan. I couldn't sleep at all. The worst is when the blood dries and sticks to your pants. When you take off the pants... 13259, why don't you sit down? Officer, I was caned a few days ago. I can't sit. You must sit when you're here! —Officer, please do us a favour. —What are you doing? 13259, sit down! Sit down! If you don't sit down, I'll report that you disobeyed orders. 13259, sit down at once! Take your hands away! No physical contact during visits. You've lost weight. Is life harsh in here? I wouldn't have to suffer if you didn't come. You had to come right after I was caned. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Will you stop being so gloomy? I'm not dead yet! I've brought you some magazines. Write to me if you have time. Don't smile if you don't want to. Don't act. Must you pretend you're sorry for me? I don't need sympathy! What exactly do you want? You don't want me to cry or smile. I'm here to visit you. I don't want to argue with you. I know you're in a bad mood, and so am I. It's no use taking it out on me. You weren't like this before. Of course not. I used to be a reporter... and now I'm a convict. I'm inside here, and you're outside. I don't know what will happen to us in three years. If we'll break up in three years, then let's make it clear now. I don't want to waste your time, and I don't want to give myself pressure. I won't break up with you. I'll wait for you. Whatever you want. You're here to see me. Now that you've seen me, I'll go back inside. Don't come here if it's not necessary. Save the visitation quota for Mom and Lok. I actually want Jess to visit me. I always think about her, but I'm afraid to see her. I don't want her to know... the kind of life I'm having in prison. I need her, but I don't want to drag her into this. Thanks. I'm waiting for you. Jess, go and keep Joe company. I won't go. You must go. Joe is well-known for his temper. You know why your boyfriend was sent to prison. Here, drink with me. I told you I won't. I'll get drunk. What are you afraid of? If you get drunk, I'll get my boys to keep you company. Do you mean it? Come on, drink. I said I won't drink. —Drink up. What are you afraid of? —I won't drink. —I said drink! —No, I won't! What's with you? Sit down... You must be gentle... to a lady. I think that was an accident on Miss Tsai's part. Be careful this time. Drink it. Drink. It's okay that you don't drink. I hate to impose on others. You know, chicks are only tasty after being soaked in wine. How dare you try to stab me! Arrest her and charge her with assaulting police officers! Joe! Why so mad? What's with the arrest? Hey, it's you, Hoe! —Yep, it's me. —What a coincidence! This girl deserves it for disrespecting you. But do me a favour and let her go. This is my turf after all. Hoe, don't say that. We're good friends. I'll always do as you say. Apologise to Joe at once! Say sorry now. I'm sorry, Joe. Forget it. Go and get ready to sing. Let's use this chance to drink together. My thoughts exactly! You're gutsy. You tried to stab an inspector. Do you know what would happen to you? An inspector is almighty. He could do whatever he wants. He could send me to prison or he could even take my life. I do admire girls who have such a strong personality. In other words, you're interested in me, right? You're clever. If I must sleep with you because you helped me... then you're no different from Chiang Yiu Joe. I'm gentle to women. I won't force them. You're roughing it out in this world. You should get a strong backer for yourself. Why don't we be friends? I'll see you back. After the medical check-up, I was classified as First Grade. I was sent to 16A to do manual labour. The physical labour is really tough. But that's the only chance I get to leave the prison... and breathe some free air. What's the matter? Your butt hurts again? Something nudged against my private part. That's what happens when we don't have underwear. It's best that you tie your pants legs with a rubber band. That ought to do the trick. I got you... This is a fat one! Too bad there's only one. If there were many of them... I could trade them for cigarettes with the officers. Grasshoppers can be traded for cigarettes? They use grasshoppers to feed the birds. Hey, I'll give you some good stuff. What is it? It's good stuff. This is aloe. It's very useful. I picked it up over there. —What's the use? —It's very useful. It's a good hair conditioner and facial moisturizer. It heals wounds too. —Really? —Crush it to get the juice. Rub some on your butt and you'll feel better. Thanks. Hide it and don't let the jailers see it. Officer, ask that prisoner to come in to help me out. Three-legs, come over here. —What is it, Officer? —Go to her place... —To do some cleaning. —Yes, sir! Come with me. —Don't interrupt! —Let him boast on. We drank some wine and became hot. Then we took it from the sitting room to the bedroom... and from the bedroom to the kitchen. I used all my strength and she screamed her lungs out. You're amazing! You should have stuffed her mouth with her underwear. If Psycho heard you, you would be killed on the spot! You don't know. She was so satisfied that she wanted me to stay for dinner. But I told her I had to come back to you guys. She gave me a lot of chocolate when I left. You can eat chocolate with my efforts on the bed. Here. One for each of you. Don't snatch. Who wants... I want one! Never-dead, take care of this. —Here... —The last one now... Thank you, sir. I have a pen and paper, but no address. Who wants Write Add? None of my business, I'll go to sleep... Brother Plane, what's "Write Add"? "Write Add" means to write down your home address... and mark the amount you want to pay the guy holding the paper. Sign it... and the officer will collect the money from your family. After he gets the money, he'll give you a small portion of it... and he'll take good care of you. This type is called Live Fish. If there's nothing offered, then it is a Dead Fish. Do you want to be a Live Fish? Count me out of this dirty business. You're a stubborn bookworm! —I remember in the past... —What then? That time I hit an inmate in Cell B like this... and he had to spend a week in the hospital. I didn't know I could hit so hard. Right, you're really something. Sir! So many people gathered here. What are you talking about? Sir, nothing serious. I was telling them that you're really strong in karate. Ask him if you don't believe me. Yes, sir. When I was at the academy I heard the instructors say... you're a competent karate fighter. Sir, please show us your skills some time. Stop right there. You're in luck. He's in a good mood today. Come and have a look. Sir, it's ready. Come on, sir. One, two, three! This Psycho is such a scumbag! How can they be cooked with all this sand? He deserves to have a kid that has no butt! Serves him right that his wife is sleeping around! Kitchen Kid, clean them up and cook them. Sir, I have something to tell you. What is it? You have the right to demonstrate your karate skills... but you do not have the right to do it with our food. This is to be our dinner. You smashed and dirtied it all. How are we supposed to eat it? I'm sorry, I didn't think of it. You do have a sense of justice. I appreciate people like you. —Sappy. —Sir! Take him to Three-hands' room. Yes, sir! I want to treat you to milk tea. 13259, come with me. Kid, you're in luck. Sir seldom treats anyone to milk tea. I think he admires you. Just wait. —Bo, get me a big cup of milk tea. —Yes. Here. Sir! Sit down. You're gutsy to speak to me like that. I was only telling the truth... Who do you think you are? You're just a convict! A convict! A convict is less than a dog! It's okay if you kill me! Three-hands, convicts are human beings! You're right. Convicts are human beings. Get me the milk tea! Stand still! Don't say I'm not good to you. I'll treat you to milk tea now. Open his mouth! You don't like milk tea. I'll help you get that out. Hold him! Take it. I owe you three cigarettes. I'm sorry, bosses... —What's wrong with you! —It hurts... You couldn't take care of yourself, yet you tried to be the hero. You think this is your home? You tried to reason with Psycho. —Just hang in there. —Brother Plane, help me! I'm helping you to rub some medicinal oil. Here, you lose! Darn it! He shouts the whole night, and I lose very time he shouts. Darn it! I'll jump you if you keep on shouting! Ahn, pipe down, or the boss will lose his temper! Ahn, be quiet! Try to be quiet! Just hang in there! What's wrong with you? This sheep suffers, because he stood up for us... and you still want to rough him up? This guy is really unlucky. Psycho's three famous specialties: Trumpet, water pipe and hair with water. And he chose hair with water. Speaking of which, the hair is stuck inside the stomach. This could be fatal. Feed him cotton! No way. Feed him cotton? He's already dying and you still... Yes, cotton will work! Guys, who has cotton? Lend me some cotton! There's cotton in the pillow. I'll get you some. Ahn, cotton will work! Ahn, don't be scared. Eat as much as you can. You'll feel better after eating the cotton. Eat as much as you can. The hair will stick to the cotton. You'll be all right after you take a dump. Take care. Have you been busy at school recently? No. Where's Mom? Jess asked me to give you her regards. I asked you where Mom is! Why hasn't she come? How is Mom? Mom is dead. —What did you say? —What are you doing? Hands off or I'll take you back inside! Why did Mom pass away so suddenly? She cried everyday since you went to prison. One day I came back home and I couldn't find her. I called Jess. We went to look for her. We finally found her in the park next to your old school. What was she doing there? She said she wanted to pick you up from school. After we look her home, we noticed she was a bit odd. Why didn't you watch her closely? I did watch her closely. Every time she disappeared, I would go to the park to find her. —But one day... —What happened? Mom disappeared again. I went to the park, and I saw many people gathered around. It turned out that Mom was hit by a car. Before she died, she asked me if school had let out. I took care of Mom's funeral. Her funeral will be held in a few days. Good. You failed. I was so scared! I'll beat you! Ahn! Hey, what's with him? Ahn! Ahn! Ahn! Hey... Ahn, what's the matter? Are you okay? Sir! My mom has passed away. I want to take part in her funeral. You think this place is a hotel? This is a prison. You can't come and go as you wish. Sir, please help me out. My mom was hit by a car because of me. I'll never be at peace with myself if I don't attend her funeral. That's none of my business. I only care about myself. Get lost now! I won't approve to let you go. Sir, I beg of you! Let me go to her funeral! Please have mercy on me! If you want to die, then be quick about it. If everyone wants to go to a funeral, then this prison will be empty. Sir, I'll never be at peace with myself if I don't attend her funeral. I'll kowtow to you! —Get lost! Take him to isolation! —Sir, have mercy on me! —Take him away! —Sir, please let me see my mom! What are you doing? Just shooting the breeze. My mom's death was a huge blow to me. I nearly went to pieces, and I had totally lost my reasoning. But when I saw myself bleeding, I realised I didn't want to die. Because if I were to die like this... it would mean that I'd been defeated by the forces of evil. That would also mean there was no justice in this world... and that good could never triumph over evil. I'm not convinced. I decided to struggle on. The more Psycho and Chiang Yiu Joe wanted me to go down... the more I must struggle to live on well. Thank you, sir... Hey, this is your bed. The doctor said you have a temperature of 103 degrees F. You can only eat congee. No rice. Man, I'll have no strength if I don't eat rice. Help me out here. Get me some rice for meals. I only pretended that I had a fever. I knew it just by the way you look. Who could be this alert with a high fever? —Make yourself at home. —Thank you... How is it? Brother Plane. Are you all right? You tried to commit suicide. It would be good if you had died. You brought this on yourself. Why didn't you tell me? Don't worry, Brother Plane. I've thought it through. This will never happen again. That's more like it. You're ill? Right back at you! I ate several chilies to make my tongue swollen. I came here to check on you. Thank you. Look at you! Just like you, I wasn't used to being here when I first arrived. After a while I do enjoy it here. All those guys outside have to spend decades here. If they're like you, they would have killed themselves many times over. I know. What are you in for? I won't tell you. Oh, okay, I'll tell you. I used to be a chauffeur. One day while I was driving my boss to the office... a car rushed out from a path... and hit our car. I got out to discuss it with the driver. The fool bad-mouthed my mom right away. I respected my mom the most. There was no way I would let him off. So I gave him a left hook. I didn't know I would seriously injure him. Later I found out that he was a Justice of the Peace. You know, JPs are rich and influential people. He had the police set me up. So I ended up here. Let's not talk about it anymore. Hey, I've asked the kitchen boys to save up two eggs for you. Thanks. I want to do a Write Add. Brother Plane, I want to be a Live Fish. You want to be a Live Fish? Who is Observatory? —I am. —What does the observatory do? —To be on the lookout. —Then go at once. Live Fish, show up! Here! Aren't you something? Live Fish goes out! Shepherd, we want to buy something. Here! Sir, what can I do for you? Get me two cans of curry beef and sardines. —Also, get a packet of cigarettes. —Got it. —I want Lucky. —Yes, sir! Ahn, what do you want to eat? I'll buy you some. Doesn't matter. I'll eat whatever you get me. I'll get a girlie mag for you to get off on! I'll go get it now! Sir, we still have time. The JP isn't here yet. Why don't we hold a dog race? Okay. Come here! All of you! Sir, you choose first. I'll take you. He's strong and tall. I'll choose him then. This one's swift. We'll choose Ahn! Okay, we'll choose Ahn! Come on, get ready. Go! Faster... —Ahn... —Faster... You're quick! Ahn, well done! I'm sorry, sir. Sappy will get you the cigarettes. Assemble at the playground. The JP will arrive soon. Collect, sir! The JP has arrived. Do you have any requests or complaints? Hello. Let me know if you have any requests or complaints. Ahn, what are you doing? I have a request! What is your request? I request that inmates should have underwear. What is your reason? Sir, if we wear underwear... we could work harder without fearing wounds. Because we also have to clean at staff quarters... and work in the neighbouring villages... it's inevitable that we come into contact with women. It would be embarrassing if we exposed ourselves. I think he has a good point. What do you think? Sir, the annual expenses of the department will increase a lot. Sir, men without pants are like uncivilized barbarians. They have no self-respect or respect for others. That's why prisoners fight all the time. If you grant us pants... there will be more peace and less violence in prison. That is a very interesting point. You speak fluent English. You have been educated. What is your educational level? Tertiary level. What did you do after school? I used to be a reporter. That means you'll have a lot to write about after you leave here. Write a few more lines about me. Most certainly. You must write the good stuff. Thank you, sir! We'll consider your request. It shouldn't be a problem. —You arrange for that. —Yes, sir! Thank the JP at once. —Thank you, sir! —Thank you, JP... You speak English so well, you should tell him... that we need hookers every week. You're really something. —Terrific! That's great! —Ahn, you're really something! Ahn, I didn't know. You're really something! He has a tertiary education after all. He's not like you. You don't even know your ABCs! Ahn, when will you teach me? I didn't know you could speak English so fluently. Silly boy, there are so many JPs coming here each year... this is just routine. When they pass through the gates... they'll forget everything. Kitchen Kid, get some meat to feed the dog. He lives up to his namesake. The meat is our food, but he takes it to feed his dog. What can we do? There's a saying, "A prisoner is not as precious as a dog." Nan, you sang the wrong lyrics. "Even a dog can eat meat, while we prisoners cannot." We mustn't let this go on. What can we do? Should we fight him? We don't have to do that. You have an idea? Let's deal with him the same way that he has been dealing with us. So do you have a way then? Mad Dog, can Pig Colon do it? Don't worry. Pig Colon was a famous cook for this stuff. Once you tried it, you'll be moved. Will my nose bleed for eating it in the summer? Who cares? I'll eat it even if I'll be bleeding through my butt. "This show nearly kills me. This show is so sweet..." —We'll be eating some good stuff. —Time's up! Assemble! Sir, please sit down. —Sit down, sir. —Sit here. Bring the fan! Here you go. No one can resist dog meat. Even the gods are attracted by it. Hey, Shepherd, come here. Brother Dog, what is it? —This is for you and Ahn. —Thank you! Thank you, Dog, Nan, Bill, Wai... Thank you, Bosses! Bosses, is there any left? Ahn, have some for your health. —No, it's okay. —Go away... —You're great. —Someone's here! —Sir! —What are you doing here? —Are you slacking off? —Sorry, sir! —Have you seen my dog? —No, sir! I haven't seen it the whole day. I don't know where it has gone. Outsiders consider a prison a city of crime. Actually, these inmates are just being suppressed. They have no freedom and they're only protecting themselves. They're also human beings. When I learnt how to live with them, life became much easier. Hurrah... Starting from today, we get to wear underwear! Guys, we finally have underwear! There's enough for everyone! I need a medium and a large. One for each. I'm taking one on someone's behalf. Thanks... Ahn, come and wear one. I haven't worn underwear for years! It's soft and smooth! Wow, this is wonderful! Let's put them on... come on... It fits me perfectly. Wow, I look so smart now! Come here... Guys, we owe these underwear to 13259. Thanks to him, we don't have to suffer chafing anymore. Bravo... Good job! Well done, Ahn! You're really something! Let us present you with some candies and cigarettes. Please keep the cigarettes. You can trade the cigarettes for food. However, we do have one thing for you. Ahn, please accept this. —Thank you. —You're welcome. Ahn, although I'm rough, I do respect educated people. I'll never fight with you from now on. Let me know if anyone bullies you. I'll jump him for you! Thank you, Dog. Since we're so happy, let's hold a party to celebrate! Why are you so happy? You've eaten poop? Random check! Squat down! Squat! Whose is this? It's mine, Officer. If you let me see what I don't like to see again... you'll all be punished! To heck with you! Lucky that he didn't find this underwear, or we would be in trouble. If Psycho finds his wife's underwear here, you would be done for! I'm lucky. Even the gods help me. Go to sleep at once! That harlot didn't have enough of me. She asked me to look for her last night. Do you know what she wanted me to do once I arrived? What did she want... She asked me to tie her to the bed! —That's exciting! —Three-legs! What is it, sir? You are to do the shopping. No problem, sir! You want to escape? No, sir, I'm only going shopping. No, I'm only going shopping! It's true! Sir... I'm only doing shopping for them. I'm not escaping! It's true! Shopping? Really? Die! I want you dead! Three-legs went shopping that day and never returned. According to the report, Three-legs wanted to escape... and fell off the cliff while being chased. Of course, everyone in the prison knew that... it was Psycho's doing out of revenge. Whoever has no cigarettes but has strength, come out! Anyone? Get cigarettes... Three-legs, rest in peace. We promise we'll seek justice for you. Everyone was upset about Three-legs' death. It wasn't just out of pity. None of us wanted to be the next Three-legs. That evening everyone was in a low mood. The bosses decided to go on a hunger strike. We must avenge Three-legs' death! What should we do? We should go on a hunger strike. Hunger strike? How long can we last? This won't do. I'm going to write an editorial to expose the details. I hope to use public pressure to force an investigation on this case. You're educated. You can write. But a pen is just a pen. It's not a gun. Don't be naive. Ahn, you're educated. Of course, you have lots of theories. But when it comes to fighting, of course we have to get in close. Nan, it's okay. You fight while I write. Whichever way works will be beneficial to us. You write while we fight. —Tell the guys we'll not eat! —Okay! Who is not eating? What kind of a leader are you? They won't eat now. I'll be ruined if the JPs learn of this. Sir, they won't fast for long. If they continue, I'll rough them up. Then it'll be solved. If you fail, I'll have you demoted. You better watch out! Nan, the four of you! Come out! The four of you, go out at once. Nan, are you trying to mess with me? Three-hands, we don't dare to mess with you. One of our buddies died mysteriously. That's why we have no appetite. Is that forbidden? I'm warning you. If you don't eat at the next meal... then don't blame me. What? Are you threatening us? Three-hands, you have power while we have time. Bring it on! You have fists and we have chests. If you want to play, then let's play a big game! Everyone was excited on the first day of fasting. Everyone was united. Psycho didn't take any action. I still believed a pen was more powerful than a gun. I gave the editorial to Romanchy, and he delivered it to Uncle Chien. It's about someone's life. Romanchy didn't approve of Psycho's behaviour. The prison appeared to be quiet. Nothing seemed to be happening. But Nan and the other bosses were having a meeting. I don't know how you feel about this, but I'm sure Psycho will take action. He'll probably wait until we have no strength. Why fear him? We'll just fight back! We may not even have the strength to pee, let alone fight. Even if we fight back, we must have tactics. All our men's lives depend on us. What should we do then? Are we going to stop fasting? Of course not. We'll suffer more if we resume eating. How about this? If you guys are okay with it, then let's bet with our lives. Prison rules. Brother Plane... —What is it? —What is "prison rules"? How would I know? There are lots of rules in here. It must be something serious. Here. I'll draw last. I'll draw first! What the heck! I have no luck. It's "Live." Let me do such a risky job. That's no fun. I'm unlucky too. I would rather draw again. I've drawn "Live." Mad Dog, I'll bet two packets of cigarettes with you. I'll bet Wai will get the "Death" draw. I won't bet with you on this. Look at Wai. He has a pretty good complexion. He's in luck. It's not worth betting this time. Wai, you want to draw "Live" or "Death"? Of course "Death"! Say, you want me to get "Live" or "Death"? "Death"! Nan, it's either you or me. It's better that I draw "Death." You see, Nan? Even Mad Dog said I'm in luck. You're such a scumbag! Couldn't you have drawn this one? Why did you have to draw mine? Ask everyone to go to the end of the cell. Whoever draws it come over here. Who will be in charge of the weapons? I'll take charge. Lock the dark cells. I'll see to the cooking. After we take out Psycho, my men will snatch the weapons. You better snatch the weapons, or else they'll be charged with murder. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Boss, even Never-dead has it too. Kid, do you have what it takes? Never-dead, be smart. Don't disappoint me. Don't worry, Wai. If Psycho takes action, I'll rush in and take him out. You feel uncomfortable? Are you nervous? Tell me if there's anything. Maybe I can help you. I'm... very scared. I'll be getting out in six months. I don't want to kill Psycho. Go talk to Wai then. You don't understand. Triad members cannot decide their own road. Especially when it comes to murder. I think many of those who have committed a crime... are willing to be punished. They're willing to wait till the punishment ends... and go back to society. But how many people know that... there's an entirely different world in prison? Those not belonging to the triads, just like us sheep, are being bullied hard. We even have to become Pee-boys. We have no dignity at all. Those belonging to the triads are different. To them, strength and respect are of the utmost importance. Actually, deep down they're all scared. Just like Never-dead. He's so scared that he couldn't sleep. He's been in prison for three years. Just a few more months and he would be released. But now... He didn't know if he could see his family again. I didn't know how I could help him. The only thing I was sure was that we must never make a mistake. Once we go wrong, we may never be able to go back. Three-legs... Three-legs... Three-legs... The inmates refuse to eat. They're trying to stir up trouble. To stir up trouble means they want us to be dismissed. If we're dismissed, then who would care for our family? So you must beat up whoever refuses to eat. Just beat them like dogs. Don't be lenient on them. Do you understand? Three-legs... Three-legs... Three-legs... Stop it! Who won't eat? Okay. You wanna mess with me? Beat them hard. Beat them! What are you doing here? Ben Cheng, someone from the Police Department wants to see you. Mr Wang Tin Shing. Mr Ben Cheng. We suspect you're both related to the death of prisoner David Mak. Please come with us to the police station. Move it! Why don't you thugs eat now? Start eating! Let's eat! Come on! I'm sorry that you couldn't become a hero. Ahn, stop messing with me. I'm really grateful to you. Forget it. You're called Never-dead so of course you won't die. Ahn, let's not talk. I just wet my pants. I have to change now. Ahn... Wow, you're eating so much. I haven't eaten for days. I have to fill myself up. —Guys, listen up! —This may not be enough for you. We can have good days now that Psycho is arrested. Ahn, you're really something! Guys, there's one more thing. In honour of Ahn, I suggest we abolish the Pee-boy system. Peeing is our own business. Those with weak kidneys will have to make a few more trips. Mad Dog, you have to suffer from now on. You'll have to make frequent trips to the toilet. So what? I'll drink less water from now on! Ahn, you're amazing! Ahn, you're responsible for this. Guys, take good care of him! Bravo... Ahn is amazing... Everyone was happy that Psycho was arrested. And because of this I became their hero. But deep down I missed Jess a lot. Have a seat. Why are you looking me up so late at night? Between you and Chiang Yiu Joe, who will get the post in Yau Ma Tei? Why do you care about me so suddenly? Because I don't want to see Chiang Yiu Joe win. I want to see him go down. I want to see him fall on hard times. It's scary when women get to be this cruel. You want to use me to get rid of Chiang Yiu Joe, right? Yes, I've waited for this chance for a long time. But I won't owe you anything. Would you be interested in making a deal with me? Good! What I like about you is that you're upfront and direct. —Cheers! —Cheers! Voluptuous women really have no brains. That idiot really thinks... I'd help her to get rid of you if she sleeps with me. Of course, we're buddies. We're just like a pair of hands. We need each other to survive. From now on, we have to work together. That's how we'll make real money. Hoe, I'm counting on you to look after me. —The feeling is mutual. —Cheers! This wine is good, but it lacks something. Really? Right, it lacks the taste of women! That's right! Good wine must have women to go with it! I know what you have in mind. Here they are. —Greet Hoe. —Hoe. —Greet Joe. —Joe. —Good, have a seat... —Have a seat. Joe, these three are newcomers. They're really hot. You'll score the three of them tonight. All at one go! —Hoe, are you trying to kill me? —You can do it! Hoe ordered us to serve you well tonight. That's right, Joe. I've tried many flirty women, but I prefer freshness. I want a change tonight. I want someone shy. You, come here! You, go away. Come here... What's your name? Kitty. —Wait. —What's the matter? Let's play a new game. How troublesome. Let's play with this. You were shy back there... but you seem pretty experienced. I'm not scared of you! Harlot, playing me for a fool? You'll get it from me! Here I come! —Help... —Hey, why are you shouting? —Help... —Hey, stop taking pictures... Go out... Stop taking pictures! Stop it! Go out... Chiang Yiu Joe, you're suspected of rape. You're under arrest. Not only that. I'm charging you with one more crime. You had sexual intercourse with an underage girl. You scumbag! You set me up! Get off! —Fall in line! —Fall in line! —Hurry up! —Fall in line! Chin Ahn! 13259, why aren't you moving? You've been a policeman for years. You probably know how the inmates would treat a rapist. You have the right to request political asylum. If you ask for that... you won't be staying with the other inmates. You'll be living alone and you'll be monitored. It's fine with me. Do whatever you want. Come here... Whether you like it or not, I'll arrange political asylum for you. You were a policeman. I don't know what the inmates will do to you. You should understand. I've been a policeman for years. I've seen everything. I'm not scared of those human trash. I'm telling you, this is a prison, not a police station. You're like all other inmates here. You won't get any special treatment. I've decided to post you at the Fingerprint Room. I won't guarantee your safety if you leave the Fingerprint Room. Don't worry. They won't eat me up. —Take him for the cavity check. —I'm ready. Take off your pants! Hey, move it. Don't play any tricks. Brothers, the Bible says God loves humans. He even sent us his only son. He promises that whoever believes him will live eternally. Every one of you here is a lost sheep. Although you're in prison, God still cares about you. Hey, come see me after the mass. Don't go anywhere. I'll take you back to the Fingerprint Room. I won't be responsible if anything happens. Don't worry, sir. I have so many enemies here. Of course, I'm afraid. It's good that you know. Please raise your hand if you're a believer of God. Here... Hey, you believe in Jesus? —No. —Then why raise your hand? Don't you know? If you believe in Jesus, you'll be given a present. If you raise your hand and say you believe in Jesus... it means you're part of the team. You'll get at least two presents. Raise your hand now! Believe in Jesus. Those who raised their hand, please come onto the stage. We have brought some presents with us. We hope you'll have a good festival. Will you please help me distribute these presents? After the distribution, will we get two presents? Oh, I'm sorry. Because we don't have enough presents... these are for the future believers. Really? Since we're Christians, we only need God's love. Help me to distribute the presents now. Stop complaining. Hand them over... Keep some for me. Please hand them over. Do I have one? —Yes, one for each of you. —What about me? Only we don't get one. Yes... of course. Ahn, watch out! Stop running! Officers, help me! Someone wants to kill me! Officers, help me! Someone wants to kill me! Go away... Garbage, come out! You want to get back at me, right? I'm here! Come out and kill me! Come out... You scumbag! You set me up by having your girl sleep with another man! But that's fine. Wan Chi Hoe only had sloppy seconds from me. It was me who popped your girl's cherry. I even let my boys nail her. You should call me brother. Scumbag! Out of the way! Don't block me! Ahn's in trouble! Guys, block the door! Block the door! —Go away... —There's nothing to see! There's nothing to see. In prison it's all about survival. We'll have congee for breakfast tomorrow. It's the first time I've seen someone die so horribly. Although I hated Chiang Yiu Joe, I didn't want him to die. The report was well written... because many people in the choir saw Chiang Yiu Joe kill Plane. The report said Chiang Yiu Joe escaped after killing Plane... and accidentally fell into the pot of congee. The most unlucky ones were the inmates. They didn't dare eat congee for a couple of months. Shrimp dumpling! Pork dumpling! BBQ pork bun! Shrimp dumpling! Pork dumpling! Sticky rice chicken! Chicken feet! Boss, do you want Pu-erh or Sau Mei tea? —Shove it up your butt! —Okay! Mad Dog, have you forgotten that Ahn will be released today? That's right! Okay... that's terrific. No wonder. The guy who leaves can do whatever he wants. You're the last to come here, but you're the first to leave. —Ahn, I wish you the best of luck. —Thank you. Bill, Wai, Dog, and Nan. Thank you for taking care of me. Don't mention it. We're even since you've forgiven me... for trying to go through your backdoor. Don't be mad that I made you my Pee-boy. Not at all. You have taught me so much. What we taught you is useless! Hey, guess what Ahn will do first after leaving here. I think he'll get himself a hooker. After all, there's the saying, "Prisoners will find the ugliest women sexy." Not everyone is as horny as you are. —You're the horniest! —That's right. I want to write a book. Write a book? I plan to write a book entitled "Waves of Life". This book would commemorate my mom... Plane, Three-legs... and also all the friends I made in this prison. Congratulations.
