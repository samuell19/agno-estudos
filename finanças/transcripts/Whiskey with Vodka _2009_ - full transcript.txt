You do that so well, Henry, With love. That's why I'm doing this film. Because of you. Don't you have something that doesn't smell so much like schnapps? I don't like it. You know that. We're ready for you. Otto, I'm very glad that everything's going well. Really, we're all very glad. I'm happy too. Coffee, Mr. Kullberg? - Thanks, I have my own. Mr. Kullberg! An autograph, please. - Just one picture! To Thomas, please. To Julia. Hey kids, I have to work. Picture next, get ready to shoot. Otto's coming. Could we speed it up? Your mic. The cake is missing. Otto, mic check, please? Bibbety, bobbety, bo ... Thanks, OK. It all looks very light on the monitor. Is that what it will look like? Take a look. Look. - Right. Heike's shoes need to go here. OK, I like it. It's good. Next time, put it on the right way around. Could you push the cake forward? Like that. Thanks. Otto is here. Get ready for a take. One sec. Natasha... The socks. Are we ready, Melanie? - Yes. Stand by... Quiet on the set, picture next! Roll sound. - Rolling. WHISKY WITH VODKA Action! Why are you doing this to me? Everything you've never tried is worth trying. You know she's my daughter? Uh huh. And who's that with you? My daughter is engaged. I assume you expect nothing but contempt from me. Asshole. Cut! Otto... "Asshole" is directed at the fiancé. Say it in this direction. Got it. - We're going again. Roll sound. - Rolling. 34/5. Take two. Action! Why are you doing this to me? - Everything you've never tried is worth trying. - You know she's my daughter? Uh huh. And who's that with you? My daughter is engaged. I assume you expect nothing but contempt from me. Cut, cut, out. Otto. You forgot the "asshole". What? I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. You know... Could I get my coffee? The mother-daughter situation is very unpleasant for you. You're on the defensive but then that man interferes, it's totally unacceptable. You understand? You're not nasty, more like tipsy. So it's a heartfelt word. "Asshole." - That's it. One more thing, Otto. Don't you think it would be better to drink from the glass not the bottle? Right, the glass. Of course. - Right. From the glass. - Good. Heike... At this moment, you love him, just out of spite. I need to see that, please. Holger, ready? - Yes. Let's shoot it. Come here. A little less. Quiet on the set. Back to first positions. Quiet for a take! Roll sound. - Rolling. 34/5. Take 3. Action! Why are you doing this to me? Everything you've never tried is worth trying. You know she's my daughter? - Uh huh. And who's that with you? My daughter is engaged. I assume you expect nothing but contempt from me. Cut. Cut! Otto, let's leave out the "asshole". Perhaps it's too coarse for you? Why? I like the word. By the way, you're an asshole too. Oh Otto. You OK, Otto? Hang on ... I think he was drinking. - That's not possible. What's in the bottle? That's tea. - He only drank coffee. Martin, let's go again. Why don't I play the scene lying down? This isn't just coffee. I don't need to stand to say "asshole". No thought went into this film. Take care of him. We need to figure something out. We'll do your close-up, Bettina. I'll be right back. Did he start in make-up? I didn't see anything. No water! Give me a cigarette. Can I help you, Otto? I feel great. Would you like to lie down for a bit? I don't need to lie down. Otto! Get him down! There's nobody up there. So why should I go up there? No idea! I knew it! I saw it coming. He won't be able to stick it, and we end up dipped in shit. I need to call Leo. - I'd wait. It's not even 10 o'clock. It's déjà vu all over again. Morning, Otto. We haven't seen each other today. I hear you're not feeling well? What's up? Nothing. Do you need a break? I'm just thinking. I'm unhappy. What are you unhappy about? I'm not telling you. Could you watch out for him? If you like. If we're done for the day, I'd like to go back to town. My wife is pregnant. - I'll see what I can do. OK, good. Try to focus. It's the only thing we can shoot. We're this close. A reaction shot after he says: Everything you've never tried is worth trying. Slowly. Everything you've never tried is worth trying. A little more slowly, please. - OK. Everything you've never tried is worth trying. Yes, very nice. But you can hit it a little more. Yes, OK. - OK? We'll do it again? Everything you've never tried is worth trying. You're probably my last friend. Not the next one, the last one. Yeah, I think so too. It's Leo. Help yourselves. What? Right, I get it now. That's an unusual suggestion. I don't think it's ever been done. It could be difficult. And expensive. What did he say? He wants you to shoot everything twice. What? Shoot twice. Once with Otto and with another actor. He wants two options, with and without Otto. Otto needs to learn once and for all that he's not irreplaceable. Call Leo. It's Telleck. I must reject your suggestion, of course. For artistic reasons as well as reasons of decency. I'm not a bucket for people to shit in. Not even you. Well said, Martin. It was a relevant point. But what do we do if we lose Otto? Last time, he was out for months, got his shoes stolen once. It was in all the papers. Leo wants to save the film. It's Leo again. I overreacted a little, sorry. But without Otto, we'll have to redo the winter scenes. The film is set in two seasons. They represent two lifetimes. We are making great cinema. What do you mean, not important? I'll do my best. Yes, I'll explain it to him. Explain it to him? Explain it to you. Leo says it's an auteur film anyway. A Telleck film. It's all up to you. And the real lead is Bettina. He said he's very happy that you're in it. And he says we can lose the winter scenes. If necessary. But he loves Otto. He wants to make a film with Otto Kullberg. You should find a talented but unknown man who won't just think of money if he can get exposure. - What are you talking about? He's a completely different type than Otto. It will bring a brand-new feel to the film. For you too. Actually, I always wanted a younger actor. I don't know what I'm getting into. But Leo wanted Otto. And you agreed. Because Otto is a great actor. Of course he's a great actor. I'm going to get some air. I wanted to see how you're doing, Otto. Are you asleep? This circus is pointless! You have a golden contract, Otto, but it contains a certain clause. Don't forget why you didn't make a film last year. Everything's fine. Just a nervous heart. That's from all this shit. If I wanted to annoy you, I'd tell you the real cost. Any other job, you'd be out. All I'd need to do is go to the media. You think they'll take your side? Everyone knows I drink! They love you, but they'll forget you. Call me anytime. - We will. Good luck. I'd keep the media out of it. At most, we'll say it was your idea. That you didn't want to jeopardize the film with your fragile health. That shows selfless team spirit. And it sounds good. Watch closely, boys. What else do I have to do, you assholes? Content with Hermia! No. I do repent the tedious minutes I with her have spent. No! Not Hermia but Helena I love: Who will not change a raven for a dove? The story is based on real events in the 1920s. At the time, nobody realized it would become such a drama. But we're doing it with humor. At least I hope we are. But now we've got Kullberg's alcohol problem. It could be a serious backslide. You probably know his last film was never finished. That cost a lot of money. You mean that if he sees me as a rival, he'll try harder to stick it out? - That's what we hope. So the better I am, the less chance I'll ever be seen in your film. Unfortunately, yes. But if anything happens, the part is yours. Why me? I saw the screen test you did back then for Kosmos. And I know your theater work. And your agent told us you were available. I was actually going to go on vacation. Your pay will reflect your helpfulness. And the special circumstances. Has Kullberg agreed? It wouldn't be possible otherwise. I thought we were friends, Leo. Listen up! What will you do if I go home tomorrow? Because that's what I'm going to do. And then what happens to your fucking financial risk? He's threatening me. All he talks about is money. Nothing else interests him. Everyone wants you to make this movie. Especially me. And I'm going to do it, for God's sake! But I can't put up with that. I have a bad stretch behind me, you know? What do I do if no car comes to pick me up in the mornings? If I never see my film families anymore? If nobody sends me any more scripts that are crap but that I do anyway? Without glad rags to try on? If I can't kibitz at will? I have nothing else to do, you know? I bore myself when I do nothing. And then I'm supposed to stop drinking? I'm happy we're here together. Like back then. We'll never lose each other. Are you Arno Runge? Yes. - We're glad you're here. I'll take you to make-up and wardrobe. I'm Melanie, the assistant director. I think ... we could get along famously. Be careful. If I fall out of bed, I could break something. Cut. Thank you. That was very nice. For you, Holger ? - Good. Good. Check the gate. Listen, Martin. Wouldn't it be funnier if I say: "If I fall off you, I could break something"? We'll leave it. It was really very good. Too bad. I think it's funnier. Why would I fall off the bed anyway? Because you're older. You're making a little joke about the age difference. Self-deprecation. It makes you likeable. I've come to get you. Are you happy? Me? Why? - It's important you feel good. I feel good. Allow me to introduce you. Otto Kullberg, Arno Runge. I know you of course. There you go... that's the difference between us. Alex, I brought you coffee. - Thanks. I think it's wrong to do this to a man like Otto. You can do anything to anybody. - That's sad. Coffee? Say hi to Arno Runge. - Hello. You know the scene. Your lines too, I hope. That's your first position. Socks off, please. Holger, we'll do a run through without the camera. Quiet for rehearsal. Arno Runge. - Heike Marten. It's my first film. - Mine too. Let's rehearse. Slide down more. More. Move the pillow... Quiet, please! Action! I think we could get along famously. Be careful. If I fall out of bed, I could break something. What's so funny? I'm shy with strangers. I have a question. Why would I break something if I fell off the bed? And why would I fall off the bed, anyway? You're right. Let's just leave out that line. The character is younger now. Good. Let's shoot it. Back to number one! Quiet on the set. Roll sound. - Rolling. Give me a little something, Henry. I can't do that. Really. Excuse me, Could I come in for a sec? Why not? You've always been a role model for me, Mr. Kullberg. Stupid to say it now, I know. But it's true. I know I'm just a substitute player. Like in sports. I can offer you some mineral water. No thanks, I've got one. In the movies, there are no substitutes. This was dreamed up by those dip shits. I've only done theater before. Most recently, Shakespeare. But also Beckett, Brecht, Moliere and so on. I figured I'd just do this. I'll try my best and take the money. You'll try your best and take the money. More or less. Then, of course, you're a whore. We'll shoot it with Otto first. Otto, as the boat approaches, you wave and then we'll cut. The stuntman will jump across. - I'll jump myself. I do sports. We'll work that out later. I'll definitely jump myself. Otto, no risks, please. Ridiculous. Good. Boat come around! Everyone ready? We're shooting! Heads up! Picture! Cutter into position. Roll sound. Rolling. - 40/1. Take one. Action! I want to have lunch with you! Cut! Very good, Otto. My heart almost stood still. We go again, with Arno Runge. Arno, you want to jump yourself too? No problem. - Good, cutter into position. See, now we lot have a break. Stand by! - Everybody back to number one! Roll sound. - Rolling. 40/1. Take 2. Action! Stop! Cut the motor! Cut! Do something! We can do it again right away. No. We'll do it in a wide shot with the stuntman. You'll get the dry suit. The deck was wet. The main thing is you're not hurt. I'd like to do it again. - No. I'm grateful. Without you, Otto would never have jumped himself. Thank you. Stand by! We're going again with the stuntman! Not him either. I'm not sleeping with anybody here. Stop it. Then call me tomorrow. Early or late. But not now. Hi. That looked dangerous today. I was worried. - Sympathy cards welcome. Come on in. I liked it. Yes, it's beautiful. I have nothing special to say. I can offer you half an apple. Thank you. I don't mean to brag, but I think I'm a better fit for the part. Age-wise. Don't you think? But that's exactly what the film is about. The skin is not the heart. That's one of my lines. How do you get along with the great Otto? Everybody likes him. He tells stories. Distracts me when I'm nervous. Until the camera rolls. Then, it's almost as if ... he doesn't even need me. He knows ahead of time what he's going to do. It's not always easy. He's nice to me. But not terribly nice. Has he said anything about me? Not to me. I like to listen to you, but I have to make a call. Sleep tight. - You too. See you. Yes, you will. Here are the beach chairs you asked for. They're from 1928 ? - Yes. Or almost. They're old in any case. They were hard to find. Hello. - Morning. You can unload them. I'm glad they're here. Can we paint them red? No. Why not? It'd take too long. And cost too much. My calculator doesn't have that many zeros. It's not that expensive. We just paint the side that's in frame. And how do I get the paint off afterwards? The chairs aren't ours. Morning everyone! - Morning. So? Do you like it? The style needs to be consistent, interiors and exteriors. I wanted red to be a thematic constant. Inside and outside. Right. I can imagine that. The tablecloths have to be red too. Can't be done. Why do I always here what can't be done instead of how to do it? You can't film the Bible on a dime. - Well that's too bad! Everything OK otherwise? Here. This is your chair. You're sitting in Otto's chair. That could cost you a round. I didn't know. - This one's just for you. Thank you. That boosts my morale. Extras, over here please! Everyone! We're going to the set together. May I? - Please do. They don't need me until later. First with Kullberg, then with you. First he caresses my back, then you caress my back. It is pretty strange. Unusual, for sure. We'll see how it works. Cut! Otto, could you put a little more tango in it? I mean with the feet. The tango is in my face. Good, let's shoot it. Back to one. Step on it, the actors are getting older! Very funny. - Roll sound. 24/2 take one. Mark. Playback! You're a very independent young woman. I'm a grown-up. Coming to a spa by yourself. It's for the sea air. My mum sent me here. Cut! Otto? Can we start again? - What's wrong? I lost it. - No problem. "You remind me of one of the women ..." Yes, thanks for your help. - From the top, please. Martin? Don't we have one too many bystanders? Hang on. In this rather sensitive situation, I think it would be best if you would keep a distance when Otto's on camera. And vice-versa. I didn't mean any harm. - Quiet on set! Roll sound. Rolling. You remind me of one of the women I used to know. Young girls with rosy lips. For a moment, I imagined a life with each of them. And they all disappeared. I've forgotten their names. I recognize only myself. I look at you and my eyes are young. Cheat! Drop the knife! Let go! Thank you, cut! Very good. We'll do it again from the top. It was very nice, thank you. Heike, when Otto goes to the man with the knife, follow him for a step. You're concerned about him. Show it. - Martin... Doesn't it need to look more dangerous? What do you mean? - More action, you know. I could break a bottle on the edge of the table. I see his ugly knife and that's my response. I find that unnecessarily American. - I'll show you. What's wrong? I did this once in a film. It's a colossal effect. What is going on? - Perhaps not this time, Otto. Wait a sec! Shit! I just wanted to show you. Here's this older man, and he wants to show that he's no worse than a younger man. In fact, he's tougher. By fighting the guy, he's courting the girl. That's good, right? - I don't know. It won't work with that bottle anyway. We need trick glass. I said something about it 3 days ago. I don't remember who I was talking to. Melanie, I think. - We have the bottles. See! Give here. You can shoot it both ways. That gives you the option. Watch. Uh, right. Cut. - With... We don't have any of the bottles left. - Thank God! I could punch him. - Please don't! You simply confront the man. Energetically but normally! Let's shoot! Stand by, it's picture! Number one positions. Roll sound. - Rolling. 24/2. Take five. Roll playback. You're a very independent young woman. - I'm a grown up. Coming to a spa by yourself. It's for the sea air. My mum sent me here. Runge is a good WP'- It's odd that he hasn't done a movie yet. But Otto is Otto, eh? So they say. You came in like a secret. A young girl with rosy lips about whom I know nothing. Why did you marry Telleck of all people? Because he's a serious person. Ah hah. Tolerant. With integrity. I couldn't live with any more basket cases. Either it starts out with grand feeling and then all comes crashing down. Or it starts out much more rationally, with sympathy, friendship ... and the feelings come later. I would never have believed it before. Look to the front. Closed. We should have called ahead. No. I wanted to come on the spur of the moment. On the off-chance, like 14 years ago. It was a nice thought. Mr. Kullberg! I recognized you when you looked through the window. I'll open up for you. Unfortunately, today's our day off. The chef is also off. But if you'd like to eat, I'm sure we can find something. Excuse me, but I feel like I know you too. Bettina Moll. I knew it! Smile... Yes... Madness! Did you know it was me who brought you on board for the movie? When I realized that, I got drunk. No, they wanted you, of course. Both Telleck and Leo. But they were afraid something would happen again. I persuaded them. Maybe we'll do it all over again, I thought. Everything you've never tried is worth trying. Shitty script lines! That sentence hurts me, and not just in the film. To get into your pants... I drove 400 km. On icy roads! Cheers. I know. You're still so vulgar. Remember in the dining car, when you very loudly said: "I just heard the word 'fuck'. I'm not mistaken, I heard 'fuck'. I don't know who said it, but when I'm in the dining car, I don't want to hear the word 'fuck'." I was dying. It was still a rude word then. I'm still sensitive about it. Did somebody here say the word "fuck"? Can I get you something else? Two espressos, please. Is it the girl? Don't worry. I would take offense if you confused life with the movie. That always happens to me. I think Arno Runge is a very pleasant man. Very interesting. Is room 4 available? Yes. Only 5 is occupied. So show me your pretty ass. Otto, you know I don't like that kind of language. Come here. Perhaps... I'll just have a sip first. Are you nuts! Where did you get that? Give it to me. Happened to have it in my pocket. How dare you? Are you crazy? We're not married, are we? Here! Take it! You know I don't drink! But what a waste. You're an asshole. Come play, play, play my dove. Number 13 in the lottery of love. Yes, we can feel, feel, feel it. Number 13 is the safe bet to hit. Marianne is our lady luck, our dove. We'll win with that number in the lottery of love. It is true that Otto Kullberg does milk commercials? - Yes! People have loved him for 30 years. Even when he drinks milk. By the way, I could imagine making this film with you. That's nice of you. Shall we use first names? - Yes, thanks. I actually wanted a younger actor for the role. But Kullberg brings people into the theaters. It's not easy to get a movie financed these days. Excuse me. If you can get Kullberg, you use Kullberg. Although we still don't have a distributor. Maybe we'll take it to a small festival abroad. And it will come back with special notice. Where did the... - What? Where did the real story happen? - In the Black Forest. Why are we shooting on the Baltic? We got financing from Mecklenburg state. I always lay on my side to get pregnant. No longer necessary. It could have been a girl, as beautiful as you. Or a boy. As stupid as me. I always wanted to meet your parents. By the way, how's your father? He's in a nursing home. There was no other way. Don't you want to take your shoes off? What for? I'll dream of you. And I'll dream of you. I won't ask. I didn't know she was your daughter. And I had the impression ... I'm not sure how to explain it... That she didn't really want to see the film. You know? Not exactly. In her, I met a temperament that she might have gotten from you. Cut! Very good. Let's bring Arno Runge in. Thank you, Otto. OK, Bettina? Arno, could you come to set, please? We're going again. - Back to one! Quiet! Roll sound. Rain! 52/3. Take four. Action! Sleeping with someone doesn't mean a lot. But it doesn't mean nothing either. You let somebody get very close to you. It doesn't happen to me that often any more. But I think I can handle it. But for a young girl, it's different. I went to the movies. It wasn't beach weather. She sat down next to me. I didn't know she was your daughter. And I had the impression... how can I explain it... That she didn't even really want to see the film. In her, I met up with a temperament that she might have gotten from you. Cut! Thank you, cut! - Very nice. Cut the water - Very nice, Arno, thanks. Bettina, you're marvelous. We heard from medical experts that it's possible for a human to live with a chimpanzee's liver. Without being tactless, Mr. Kullberg, might that one day interest you? As long as I don't have to swing through the trees. Could we talk about the film? - Love to. What's the film about, Mr. Kullberg? Right, what's the film about... The story is a little confusing. There's a mother, a daughter and me. It's a classic romantic triangle. There's also a fiancé. He comes in later. The mother and the daughter love the same man, as happens in real life. Except it's much more complicated. Morals and fantasy are not always compatible. I wrote the script myself. How is it working with Mr. Kullberg? Very good. It's very relaxed and very concentrated. I always wanted to make a film with Otto and it finally worked out. And you have no problems? - Like what? A previous film was shut down for health reasons. I wasn't involved. - What do you say to that, Mr. Kullberg? I wasn't involved any more then either. Give it a rest. What's the film called, Mr. Telleck? The title is "Tango for Three" Or four. You don't have to drink to see double. To put it quite dryly. I don't get it. You don't have to get it. You don't have to get anything. Good. Is your film targeted more at daughters or mothers? I'm making the film for adults of all ages. Mr. Kullberg, you've played lovers in several films but you've also had on-set relationships that got media attention. As my dear friend Mastroianni once said, "It's the camera assistants who screw the most." Great parting words. I wasn't even mentioned. That was Leo's condition. That you remain hidden for now. You come from East Germany, don't you? Art was crippled there but, at the same time, taken very seriously. Is that true? More or less. We lived very differently here and there. I was also on stage. For eight years. First the ingénue roles, Then Kleist's Little Kate. Even Eliza Doolittle. Nice part. - It is, isn't it? Telleck has two grown daughters. He spends a lot of time with them. We're married, but he leads something like a double life. Did Brecht influence you? Who didn't he influence? No. You know, I don't much care for being pawed. Better to say no than never to be asked. Everything's fine, darling. Is Tillmann ready? - Yes, he's ready. I have to go. I'm thinking of your lovely, round stomach. Ditto. Action! At the movies, somebody fondled me between the legs. That was my first sexual experience. - I'm so sorry, my child. I kept waiting for it to happen again. I kept wondering if evenings were better. Or maybe the afternoon matinees. Or whether it depended on the film. Asta Nielsen was pretty good. - I'm slightly shocked. Why did you seduce my fiancé, mum? Because you're my daughter. - That's not an answer. I wanted to know who you were dealing with. Although not that specifically. I've come to get my future wife. I am going to marry this young lady. She's destined for a respectable life. We separated. Have you forgotten? I do not accept the separation. - My daughter is not fair. So be it. Nobody here can stand you, far and wide. Everything this young woman has ahead of her, you have behind you. You are ... I don't hesitate to use the word... a pig. And you are not dressed for the beach. Cut! Thank you. Arno, the threat has to be very calm. Didn't I do that? - Just a reminder. Could we cut the last line? And I just smash my fist in his face? What he says is so hurtful, he deserves it. It will look good. I know how to box. It's none of my business, but isn't that a bit crude? ... although possible. Like a special bit in my version. I suggested it once before. Let's see it. Can you fall? - I do judo. Watch out. Not bad. Let's see it again. Hey, Telleck! We shouldn't shoot different versions. If you think it's better with a punch, then I'll do it too. We were just experimenting, Otto. I don't think it's better. You don't think it's better? It doesn't fit with the 1920s. - Why not? That was the era of Breitensträter, Diener. And Schmeling. - Even so. I can't always just copy what Otto does. I have to play the role my way. I find it unnecessary for my esteemed colleague to re-invent the film. That's true. I'm not an old man. I want to play it physically. OK. But this discussion isn't helping. - Play it physically? You going to wriggle your ears? Make hand gestures? Maybe stick your nose up your ass? Maybe I could learn something. You told me yourself, younger is better. - What? You misunderstood me. I think this all sucks. I think it sucks too. Could we get some wild sound? Quiet for atmo! Nobody move. - Rolling! With the wrong plate on the table, you make a worse film. That's how it is. Fortunately, we don't have any wrong plates on the table. And I hope the second half of the shoot goes equally well. I thank you all, but I especially want to thank, as you will all understand, Otto Kullberg, Bettina Moll, Heike Marten, and let's not forget Arno Runge, whose contribution must be acknowledged as a selfless act of collegial loyalty. I still don't have a contract. Cheers! The buffet is open. Would it be better if I left? I wouldn't miss you. But you don't bother me either. Thank you. I don't drink. - Right. Your intention was good. - To your health. Leo called. He sends his best to everyone and wonders if you're sure Otto will make it? Why is he asking me? - He asked me too. Well? - I said I'd ask you. Shall we dance? So you're a non-dancer? At the moment. Do you know how far away the Milky Way is? One million light years. That's how far we are apart. More or less. That's how daughters kiss. I think. I don't have any. It's nice to look at you. Do you have a light? I don't. My bag's inside. Are you coming back in? If you pay attention, you'll see. Is he authorized to ask that? - No, he's not. I only came out here with you to make sure my bad reputation remains solid. And I don't know how I should behave. I brought you some soup while there was still some left. Thanks. Let's dance. Don't you want to eat first? - No, come on. Are there going to be speeches? - If you want to say something. Maybe. Stop the music. Otto Kullberg would like to say something. I've made 40 films. Or 50. I stopped counting. Some of them weren't bad. I think. You were always good. On this pleasant evening, I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to say that you've treated me like shit. Without decency. Without consideration. With mistrust. You lost one single day of shooting on my account. OK. That shouldn't have happened. I was distracted briefly. I was drunk. Yes. I was drunk. So what? I've lost half my life because the directors didn't know what they wanted, or the lighting was wrong, or a car broke down. Making movies means losing time. That's the way it is. You sit around and wait for hours. And then, on demand, you put your naked face forward. The only thing you ask for in return is a little respect. A little patience. Maybe even a little love. You said with the wrong plate, you make a worse film. But what kind of film do you make with the wrong heart? You have hurt me deeply, my dear Martin Telleck. You hurt me deeply too, Otto. You are unfair to all of us. If so, excuse me. I am sorry. Arno? Hi Arno. That wasn't directed at you. It doesn't matter. Can I do anything for you? Take the bottle to Otto. So he can finally start boozing. I won't repeat that. I like you as an actor. Sometimes you give me goose bumps. Can I walk you home? Or I could walk you home. I get the impression you take care of everybody. But who takes care of you? I'm in love. But I don't want to talk about it. - You don't have to. Pardon me. I'll get the extras. You're up next. Morning. What's going on? Am I the first? That was good before. - Martin! When she slides by... Otto wants to talk to you. I'm putting up with all this only because there are certain rules. I'm first, he's second. In that order. First me, then him. Go get him. That's how we're doing it. But you weren't here, so we started rehearsing. You couldn't wait? Be patient for a few minutes? You don't feel the need to wait for me? - What's going on? I'll repeat it for you: Me first, you second. Capiche? - Got it. You're not needed anyway. - So why am I here? Don't ask me. Ask the others. Just remember the order. First, second. Martin, explain it to him. I am not a bucket for people to shit in! Did you only come to the hotel with me to annoy your mother? And you called her to tell her about it? Yes. I had my reasons. So now you'll be there when I ask her forgiveness. What will happen now? I have a professional life. - We both have professional lives... Cut! Thank you. Very nice. Why do I have to say this nonsense? - What do you mean? I don't see talking about business at a moment like that. Exactly. We thought it funny that a woman worried about her reputation as a businesswoman in 1928. - It doesn't work. And nobody will laugh. - We can talk about it. But I need you to conserve your voice for the take with Arno. Do you know what you're asking of me? - Yes, I know. But I'm sick of these discussions. - Then you should do nature films. Anyway, I want to end this scene in a completely different way. And I want to talk about my part in this whole circus. I'm the only one doing everything twice. One guy leaves, the other one arrives. I try to be as fair as possible draped over two different men. That may sound nice in reality, but here it stinks. It's just too hard. I want you to hit him in the face. You break the intimacy by hitting him in the face. Unexpectedly. That will be good. Are you even listening? - You need to listen to me. But please stop your bitching. Can I rehearse it? - What? Can we shoot it now? It's nice of you to bring me. I've never flown in a helicopter. Such gay fall colors! Somebody should write a poem. There are a few. Lord, it is time. The summer's greatness ended. Cast down upon the sundials cooling shades and let the winds blow wild across the fields. Command those tardy grapes to speed their ripening. Bless them with two more days of warming sun. Urge them to reach perfection, gain in sweetness. That final heavy richness on the vine. Who's homeless now will never build a house. Who's all alone will now so long remain. Will wake, will read and write long, lonely letters. And wander aimlessly through empty streets. No solace in the windblown leaves. Wow. Cool. What on Earth are you doing? Who am I? You are my father. Bruno Kullberg. My father. Do you have a beer for me? I'll be right back. Could you come, please? He shouldn't have had a drink. At most, tea. A sip at a time. But no beer. He was a beer drinker. Not a tea drinker. So? Did he enjoy the beer? Yes, I think it did. The water's cold this morning, isn't it? Do you imagine you're hitting somebody you don't like? Sometimes. I hope it's not Otto. What a great image. He has nothing against you. It's still like a fight. We retreat to our corners after each round. Did you really hope that he would drop out? I still hope it. Shall we try again? On the sand, maybe? I'm 52. You wouldn't know it to look at you. The problem is, I know it. I'll accept that. I love you as you once were in your daughter. And I love you as you will be in your mother. Very nice. Cut! Arno, that was brilliant. Thank you. Check the gate. Congratulations. Thank you. I don't want there to be ill feeling between us. There isn't. Let me take you out. An espresso and a glass of water, please. The same. My father is dead. I haven't told anyone yet. I'm sorry. Really... so sorry. When did he die? He was in a nursing home. But then he ended up in the hospital. When I arrived, he was dying. How old was he? - 83. What kind of man was he? He was a mailman at Görlitzer station. He walked a lot of roads in his life. Normally, I'd say we should raise a glass to your father. Then we should do it. Since it's the normal thing. A double whisky. Neat. The same for you? - I drink vodka. Give me 100 grams. A double? - That's five shots in one glass. It's on me. - Next time. Thank you. I saw his old shoes next to the bed. And I realized that I wear down my shoes the same way he did. You're never as original as you think you are. Cheers. Good night. I'm so tired. I'm going straight to sleep. It's open! I didn't mean to startle you. I'm looking for Otto. I thought maybe you'd know where he is. No. You want me to get up? - No, stay in bed. May I sit for a minute? It's always strange for me when the shoot is over. The last day of shooting, and you fall into a hole. For a few weeks, the movie becomes your whole life. And suddenly, it's all over. You separate just as you're getting to know each other. It's a shame. Sometimes, you notice people too late. I think we could get along famously. That's a line from my script. Just before she kisses him. Oh. Excuse me. Otto is gone. Where were you? I'm worried about where Otto might be. We don't want to be disturbed. Your first time here? - Yes. You'll like it. Cheers. When you drink, you should always eat something. Most people don't. And never mix your liquor. Never drink one whiskey with 20 vodkas. Or vice-versa. A lot of people don't know that. Bottoms up. I'll be right back. You too? 'Course. Were you a socialist? I mean back when you were an East German. For a while. But a serious one. I once lived in an actor's commune. A huge, empty apartment. Good people. We had lots of sex, but we thought radical thoughts. We had a sign in the window. "More roles for everybody." Not just in the movies, but in life. Get it? But I thought you were always in big demand? That's just it. Drink up. I educated myself by reading on the toilet. Unfortunately, I couldn't shit as often as I needed to read. Do you think this is your big chance? That's not why I'm doing it. Honestly. You can't win. Because I'm not going to lose. I've lost before. That was a different story. That's not your fault. Actually, everything always went well for me. It was just the simple things I couldn't deal with. They weren't my forte. I mean what they call interpersonal relations. I was good at the opening moves. But not the rest. Where is he? He'll be flat on his back in a minute. They're sitting back there. He's with another guy. No good shot. What should we do? Recently, I somehow had a yardstick in my hand. It went from there to there. And I'm already here. I haven't saved up enough feelings. Excuse me... could I have an autograph? That's all you want? I'm disappointed. Come sit. Get out! The gentlemen don't want to be disturbed. Otto, look this way! Idiot! Listen, from one actor to another... why couldn't both of us be in this stupid movie? One character and two faces, as it were. Dream and reality. One of us is the dream. You, if you want. Audiences always want something new. Could you bring us another two short ones. For my friend and me. Milk - to lubricate life. In this film, I bang first the mother, then the daughter. But does that mean for sure it will be a hit? People are fed up. Thank you. - You're welcome. We live in a silly world. What did the Russians achieve? They pushed the vodka borders further West. Cheers. Can't we at least track down the taxi that took them? This would be the perfect light. I don't want an espresso now! Is it true you're going to work on Leo's next movie? It's possible. Me too, maybe. She's not answering. I hope everything's OK. It's Leo. OTTO KULLBERG - UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS! OK. I'll tell him. What did he say? - Spare me repeating it. But he wants to know how you found Arno Runge. Leo says anybody who drinks with Otto is a person without pity. And if he then gets drunk first, he's also a dilettante. So we're dealing here with a hostile dilettante. You need to give him the boot. Immediately. You should sack him even if it means being committed to Otto. I'm not a bucket for people to shit in. So, Arno. Martin has something to say to you. I wanted to tell you... That your talent as an actor and your solid theater training have vastly enriched our work. It was a pleasure to get to know you. It was obvious. Otto will make it. We hope so, yes. I have to go back in. We're pretty much done, right? That's how it is sometimes, Arno. Here. Finally, your contract. That's all there is. You're not Kullberg. Martin, I read the script. If you have a moment ... ? I don't really understand the message of the film. I mean what you're trying to say. - The message? There may not be a message in the way you mean it. You don't make a film because you're certain, but to discover something. A film is conjecture. It's about finding new images for things that repeat themselves. The great phenomena - love, death and the weather. The weather too? - Think how much depends on it! We've lost Alsace-Lorraine and the Polish Corridor. But I still have my honor. I was an officer. This is not the worst way to end. Cut! Thank you. You OK? I've rarely been quite so dead. Holger, how was it? - OK for me. Check the gate. - Blood looked good. Tillmann! - Pull! So? - It's a girl! Before you leave, I wanted to tell you that I think you are a very good actor. I've got a new offer. It's set mostly in Africa. Lots of landscape, limited dialogue. I play a kind of dropout. Should be perfect for me. At the end, I adopt twins. What do you think? Depends. It would be nice if you came along. I just wanted to say goodbye, Otto. I wish you well, Arno. Get lost. Wait! Take care. Re-shoot. 34/5. Take one. Action! Why are you doing this to me? Everything... Cut. Just a joke. And take that bullshit down. Or leave it. ASSHOLE 34/5. Take two. Why are you doing this to me? Everything you've never tried is worth trying. You know she's my daughter? Really? And who's that with you? My daughter is engaged. I assume you expect nothing but contempt from me. Asshole. Cut. Thank you. Holger? Check the gate. Very nice, Otto. Stand by! Melanie, I want to tell you something because it's the last day. You really bug me. Everybody look this way! Come, people, it's not your first crew picture. Smile. Stand by, and... One more. And everybody's here! Have we gotten older? You don't get older. One morning, you just wake up old. Leo called. He said to tell you he always believed in you. And he knew we were one big family. So we are. Everybody loves the truth. And everybody lies. We're leaving tomorrow. So we can sit here a bit longer.
