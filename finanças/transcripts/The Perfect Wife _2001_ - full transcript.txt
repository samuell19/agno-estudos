(bold orchestral music) (haunting music) (radio announcer speaking quietly) - [Radio Announcer] The holiday weekend. Here's your Labor Day forecast for the Tallahassee area. (haunting music) (radio announcer speaking in background) (haunting music) (music intensifies) (tires squealing) (object thudding) (car crashing) (glass scattering) (haunting music) (bike tire ticking) - Yeah, it's about four miles south of the airport on Kingston Avenue and Holly Hawk. Hey buddy, buddy, can you hear me? Buddy? What's your name? - Ruben, my name is Ruben Tyman. - Okay, Ruben, I'm a doctor, my name is Robert, and help is on its way, okay? Stay where you are, don't move. (tense haunting music) Ma'am, can you hear me? (haunting music) Stay down. - Leah! - Ruben? (haunting music) No. (crying) - [Ruben] Don't go, I'm afraid of the dark. - [Leah] There's nothing to be afraid of, Ruben. - Promise me, Leah, promise me that we'll always be together. - We will. (haunting music) Night-night, Ruben. Go to sleep now. (Leah crying) - You made the right call, doctor, you saved a life. - Well, I sure don't like playing God. - Think of it this way, if you hadn't been in Tallahassee for the day, both of them would've died. (eerie music) (machine beeping) - You a manicurist? Maybe work a fast food counter somewhere? (dramatic swishing) (Felicia gasps) I know one thing, you're nothing, a nobody. Just a drunk, a piece of trash. (machine beeps rapidly) And yet you live, while my brother, an artist, one of God's chosen, lies naked and cold and dead down the hall. (Felicia gasping) (machine beeps rapidly) There's no justice. (Felicia gasping) (machine beeps rapidly) (door clicks open) - [Doctor] Nurse? - [Nurse] Yes, doctor? (doctor speaking indistinctly) (Felicia gasping) (doctor and nurse speaking quietly) (tense suspenseful music) - What? (machine flat lines) (haunting music) (birds chirping) - Oh, I already miss Hawaii. - Yeah, but the honeymoon lives on. - Promise? - Till the day I die. - Don't die yet. I have such wonderful plans for us. (Robert laughs) - [Robert] Me too. (laughs) (Liza laughs) - You're home early, Dr. Steward. - Oh Greta, um, yeah it was raining and we took an early flight. (gentle music) Liza, this is-- - Helen. - My ex-wife. - Of course, Helen, I recognize you from your pictures. I'm so sorry about your mother. - Thank you, Liza, thank you. (sighs) Well I, I suppose you're both wondering what I'm doing here. - I was about to ask. - I, I had a small gift for Greta. You see, Greta and I, we're, we're old friends, and um, quite frankly, you two weren't expected back until later. And god, have you any idea how embarrassing this is? - Nonsense. Helen, you're always welcome here. Isn't she, Robert? - Yes, of course she is. - Greta, there are some bags in my trunk. Could you go get those, please? Helen, Robert tells me that you're a published author. You must be so proud. - After two manuscripts that went absolutely nowhere, I'd I'd say relieved is a better word. (telephone rings) - Excuse me. - Uh, well I'd better be going. - Helen, let's be friends. Yes? (Helen chuckles) - Yes. - (giggles) Good. - Nora, I'm not really officially back yet. - I know that, doctor, I was gonna leave a message with Greta but, well, I'm glad I've got you. Um, we've got a situation here. It's your brother. - Is this about Rachel? - She moved out last week. - Well, he knew it was coming. - He looks dreadful. He, he forgets things, he's late for appointments. Why, Jackie, Jackie at the hospital said the nurses are talking. I tried to call you in Honolulu last week, twice. - Well I never got any messages. - Doctor, I'll be honest, I'm afraid to leave him alone with a patient. - Just go fetch, Greta, go fetch. - Greta, Greta, I don't think that she meant it the way you took it. - 12 years I have been working with Dr. Robert, he's always treated me with respect, always. Even you, when you were there. - Could you give her a chance? - (sighs) I have given her every chance. For three months she's been here taking over everything. She wants me to start wearing a uniform. - Uh. - Look, I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay? - [Nora] Okay, bye. - Brad? - Mm, yeah. - Well you better get going. - Mm, yeah. - Helen, I'm telling you, that woman is no good. (speaking foreign language) (deep haunting music) (Helen sighs) (eerie music) - [Judith] Hello, doctor. - Hi Judith, where's Nora? - [Nora] I'm sorry, doctor. - It's okay, I'll take care of it. Where is he? - He's with a patient in B. - Well you're looking good, Mr. Ranier. Let's see here. - Brad, I need to see you. - I didn't expect you today. - You look like shit. - Is that your medical opinion? - My medical opinion, wise ass, is that this Rachel thing has thrown you completely for a loop. - Oh, I can't fool you, can I? - No, you can't. Look at that. Dextroamphetamine, (Brad laughs) Valium, and Dropadine, ha. - For my back. - Why the fuck didn't you call me? - You were on your honeymoon. Last Tuesday, you know, I come home from work, with flowers. (chuckles) We had a spat over breakfast, and you know, for the life of me, I can't remember what it's about, I... She's gone. With nothing but a, "Goodbye forever, "you'll hear from my lawyer" note on the dining room table. What am I gonna do, Bobby? - You're gonna get better, but no more pills. - Uh, well that's easy for you to say. - This is serious business, Brad. We're not auto mechanics here. If we make a mistake, we can't call up the manufacturer and order a new part. - All right. No more pills. - Okay. Shave. (pills rattling) (suspenseful music) (children laughing) - Hey Leah, what happens when you grow up? Do you get a boyfriend? - You're my boyfriend, Ruben, forever and a day. (children laughing) - I love you my darling, for forever and a day. (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (eerie music) I can't stop thinking of Brad, how he must feel, to lose someone he loves so much. No wonder he's acting strangely. - Do you think? I mean, he's always had bouts of depression, takes everything to heart. I, I never saw two people more ill-suited to each other in my life, but still. - You know, why don't you do somethin'? Just you two, just some guy thing. - You know, there's a Laker game on Sunday. - That'll be perfect. It'll do you both some good. - Thanks, that's a great idea. - [Brad] I'd love to go, Bobby. - [Robert] Yeah, me too. Hey you know who they're playing? - [Brad] I think it's the Sixers. - [Robert] Ah, terrific. How you doin', Brad? - Me, how am I doin'? I'm fine. - [Robert] You sure? - Seriously, Bobby, I'm fine. - Okay. (chuckles) Oh, we haven't been to a game together in years. - Oh, I envy your closeness, you and Brad. I want our children to be just as close. I wanna have lots and lots of children. - Wait a minute, I thought we settled on two. - Well, when a woman's in love, she gets greedy. - Well, let's get started. (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - Have a good Sunday, Robert, I've got better things to do. (train clacking) (train horn blowing) (Nora breathing heavily) - [Nora] Oh, dammit. (suspenseful music) (Nora cries out) (somber music) - I never liked you much Nora, but that's not why. It's just time for you to step aside. (suspenseful music) - Hey, Liza. Liza, can you help me for a minute? - Sure. - I'm stumped, what do you think? Yeah? - Now hurry up, you're gonna be late. - Thank you. Promise me you'll choose the tie for my funeral. - I promise. Save some lives. - I'll try. (suspenseful music) - Greta, if you don't mind, I'd like you to park your car in the garage from now on. - But I always park it here. - Please? And when you're doing the upstairs, could you be a bit more attentive? Especially in the master bedroom, I'm terribly allergic to dust. I was up all night sneezing. (yawns) - Think you can make me quit, you don't know me. - [Judith] Hi, doctor. - Morning, Judith. Any messages? - Your brother called from the hospital, nothing important. - Who's my first appointment? - Uh, Mrs. Jeffers, 1:15. - Okay. - Doctor, Nora isn't in yet. - I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. - But she's never done this before, doctor, not calling in? I'm worried. - Don't be. (Judith sighs) (tense music) - I told you not to touch this. - I'm just trying to be more attentive to my dusting. - Dust it, do not touch it. I'd like to be alone if you don't mind. (eerie music) Unbelievable. (phone rings) - [Judith] Dr. Steward? - Yes, Judith. - [Judith] Nora's sister wants to speak to you. She's on line one. - Hello, uh Caroline, it's Caroline, isn't it? How are you? (slow somber music) First Brad, then Nora. Some homecoming, huh? Oh god, I'm sorry. I don't know how I could say a thing like that. Nora's been with us since the first day we opened our doors. (Robert sighs) - You know, I hate to even say anything but, you should really start thinking about getting a replacement. - I know. - May I make a suggestion? - Sure. - I have some experience with office work, I could fill in. - Oh (chuckles) that would sure make things easier. - Okay, well just until you find someone else. 'Cause my real job is right here, being your wife. - Being the perfect wife. (tense music) - No good. No good. Maybe. (Liza gasps) - Oh, oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare ya. - It's okay. - You going through the patients' files? - Shouldn't I? - Sure, actually, I think it's a good idea. (Judith laughs) - 'Cuse me. Hey, gotta pee. Cover for me, okay? Mr. Dempsey's in room one, doctor. (Robert chuckles) - Keep up the good work. - Oh, I will, don't you worry about that. (eerie music) Helen, I'm just filling in until we can find a replacement for Nora. - Oh. (sighs) I still can't believe she's gone. - And so violently. Robert's expecting you. - Liza, I hope you don't mind, it's just that, well I have these properties with my mother and Robert's always been a genius with real estate. - Helen, we're friends, remember? You know where his office is. (computer keys clicking) (suspenseful music) - You gave me that, didn't you? - Yeah, for your birthday, 1995. - You remember the year? - It's inscribed on the base. - Oh, yeah. Okay, let's hear about these vast holdings you need to unload. - Well, I wouldn't say vast. (suspenseful music) - Let me know how it all works out, will you? - Yeah. There's one more thing. This is gonna come as no surprise to you, but it needs to be said. When we were together, I was an angry, paranoid-- - What're you quoting me? - Will you please be serious? Just listen to me, please. - I'm sorry, okay. - I hated myself, my life, our marriage. I thought it was because we, we couldn't have children. I knew how much you wanted them, but it was more than that. I was jealous, jealous of you, your work, all of it. (tense music) Some people find it hard to live in someone else's shadow. And I apologize for putting you through hell until I found that out. - Well, soon we'll all be living in your shadow. - (laughs) A book published is not a career. - Well, it's a pretty good start. - Well, I've taken up enough of your time. Thanks for, for listening. - Sure. - Acute carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Symptomology, weakness, nausea, angina. Allergic to Digitol. I think we have a winner, Mr. Gleason. (tense suspenseful music) - So, tell me, what do you think of Liza? And you be truthful. - I like her. You? - Yeah, yeah, I think I do. (chuckles) Robert's crazy about her though, isn't he? I mean, you can see it all over his face. Damn him. Greta doesn't like her though. - Helen. How long does it take for the sense of loss to go away? (Helen sniffles) - I'll call you when I find out. - [Wayne] You stupid sissy boy! - [Ruben] Stop, (crying) stop! - He's gone, Ruben, it's okay. Ruben, where are you? He's gone Ruben. - He's gonna kill me, Leah. - No he won't, Ruben, I won't let him. - I don't wanna die. (eerie music) - Hello, Mr. Gleason, this is Liza calling from Dr. Brad Steward's office. - [Orville] Yes? - I'm calling to confirm your appointment for Monday the 27th. - [Orville] Next Monday? - Yes. - [Orville] At what time? - 11:30. - [Orville] All right, I'll be there. - Terrific, and how are you doing on your prescriptions? - [Orville] I'm running a little low. - Okay, make sure to let the doctor know. - [Orville] All right. - We'll see you then. - [Orville] Okay, bye. - Bye. (haunting music) - What does she have in here? (suspenseful music) Oh, look at this. (suspenseful music) You are my life, my inspiration. Oh my god, he is handsome. You know what I think? I think pretty boy here keeps her motor running. While she takes Dr. Robert for everything he's got. - Oh (laughing), now Greta, I mean, it could be anybody. It could be an old friend, a relative. - You believe that? Yeah, let me hide a bunch of pictures of an uncle, a cousin, or an old school chum in a secret drawer. Oh, and I forgot, a Valentine's card. (tense music) - Well, look, all I know for sure is that you've gotta put these pictures back where you found them. - Well, I'm gonna put 'em back, I gotta go. I got a ton of errands to do. Every day her list keeps getting longer. Are you sure I shouldn't tell Robert? - Well, what good would it do? - (sighs) He's crazy nuts about her. Bye. (slow somber music) - Yeah, I know. (vacuum humming loudly) - Things are going smoothly, Ruben. Much more smoothly than I expected. (somber music) She wouldn't dare. (Liza sighs) (tense music) (Liza sighs) (tense suspenseful music) You were in my jewelry box. - It fell off the dresser while I was dusting. Some, some stuff fell out. - And you just thought you'd help yourself. - No, I put everything back. - A ring is missing, Greta. A very special ring, it belonged to my mother. - I don't care if it belonged to the pope. I never stole anything in my life, not ever. - Perhaps you can explain what this was doing in your purse. - What? - You're fired, Greta. Gather up your things and get out. I want you out, now. - The moment I saw you, looked in your eyes, I knew what you were. - What's going on here, what is this? - Ask your wife, I'm leaving. - Liza? - Robert, I fired Greta. - [Robert] Why? - Honey, this was in my jewelry box this morning. When I went to put my earrings away, it was missing. She's the only one who could've taken it. - If it was in my purse, it's because you put it there. - Stop it, Great. - You are a liar. You are lying to me-- - Greta, stop it. Will you stop it. - And you are lying to Dr. Robert. - We trusted you Greta, and you betrayed that trust. I can't think of anything lower. - Oh, I can. What about keeping secrets from your husband. She's got photographs, Dr. Robert, of a guy, a very handsome guy, him and her together. She talks to him up there as if he were there with her. - I don't wanna hear it. - And love letters, she keeps them hidden in a secret compartment in that box that she keeps on her dresser. - You're insane, Greta. (tense eerie music) - God bless you, Dr. Robert, and good luck. You're gonna need all the luck you can get. (tense music) - (sighs) Oh my goodness. I can't believe it. - It's okay, she's gone. - Aren't you curious about my secret drawer? I know I would be if I were you. - It's none of my business. - Yes it is, I'm your wife. - These are all pictures of your dad, aren't they? - I always keep them in a special place. - I'm sorry, I, I don't know what got into Greta. (Robert sighs) - Well, you're a trusting man, Robert. That makes you vulnerable. (somber music) - Morning, Liza. - It certainly is. - Help me out. Rachel tried to serve me with papers this morning. I didn't answer the door, she's gonna be mad. She's probably gonna try to call here. If she does, do not let Judith put her through. - No problem. Coffee? - Yeah, that'd be great. (sighs) (tense suspenseful music) (Orville coughs) (tense eerie music) (Orville coughs) (phone rings) - [Judith] Mr. Gleason is here, doctor. He's in room three. - Thank you, Judith. - Brad looks like he's coming down with something. - Ask me, he's looked a little weird since you know, Rachel. - (laughs) Brad, that was a joke. You always laughed at my jokes, you're not laughing. - I'm sorry, Orville, tell me again. - Doctors' office. - [Rachel] Hi, it's Rachel. - Oh hi, Mrs. Steward, how are you? - [Rachel] Hanging in there. - Good. - [Rachel] It's been awhile. - Yeah, I know, it has been a long time. - [Rachel] Is Brad there? - Yeah, he's here. Okay, I'll put you through. You take care too, okay. (telephone rings) - Excuse me, Orville. Yes. God, goddammit. Uh, put her on. (Brad sniffles) Hello, Rachel. - [Rachel] Brad, you're not-- - Well I, I'm with a patient right now. - [Rachel] You're not going to (talking quietly). - Liza? - [Liza] Yes? - Rachel called, Judith just put her through. - Oh, I forgot, Brad, I'm so sorry. - Well, anyway, could you uh, take Mr. Gleason's prescription and fax it through to the pharmacy, thank you. - Oh, have 'em send it to my house. The line down there is a mile long. - Sure thing, Mr. Gleason. - Do you know without me, this one and his brother would probably be selling shoes at the mall? (Brad and Liza laugh) - Well both Brad and Robert say you're the best teacher they ever had. - Well, best science teacher, anyway. - The best period. Come on, Orville, I'll walk you out. (eerie music) - Liza. I'm due at the hospital 10 minutes ago, and also I'm gonna be late tonight, the lecture at UCLA. - I'll wait up. - Okay. (suspenseful music) Orville, you look wonderful. - Robert, thank you. Hey, I like the new Mrs. Steward. But then I liked the old Mrs. Steward. - (chuckles) Thank you. - Look, you might take a gander at your brother here. He's looking a tad wilted around the edges. - Yeah well, I better go see a doctor. - Yeah, do that. - You know any good ones? - You made a joke. - [Helen] Are you sure that this isn't some kind of giant misunderstanding? - [Greta] Bitch, excuse my language. She's a liar, she set me up. (Helen sighs) - [Helen] She accused you of stealing? - [Greta] 12 years, 12 years. - I'll talk to Robert. - It's not gonna do any good. She's got him wrapped around her little finger. - Well I can try. - Look, I never stole anything. - I know you didn't, Great, I know. (telephone ringing) - Doctors' office. - [Helen] It's Helen. - Hello, Helen, he's not in. - [Helen] Let him know I called. - Sure will. - [Helen] Is there a problem? - No, no, no, everything's fine, mm-hmm. - [Helen] You take care. - Okay, bye-bye. - [Helen] Bye. (tense eerie music) (suspenseful music) (doorbell rings) - Oh, I was expecting a delivery, but uh, oh, this is much better. Please, please, come in. - Well, the pharmacy couldn't deliver and this is on my way home. - Uh, can I get you a soft drink? - That'd be lovely, thank you. (tense music) - I'm sorry about the cans, but all the glasses are still in the dishwasher. Please, sit down. - No, Dr. Steward, Brad, wanted you to start the medication as soon as you got it. - Um, do you know anything about this stuff? - I'm just a doctor's wife, Mr. Gleason. But if Brad thinks it's good for you, then it's good for you. You need some water? - Oh no, cola's fine. You know the boys uh, were both in my classes. - Science, right? - That's right. Freshman science and biology. And they were both A students. Now, Brad had to work like a beaver to catch up to his brother's record. Things always came easy for Robert. - You ever think they'd end up being doctors? - Well, they used to talk about it a lot. But then I thought, well, you know kids. - Yeah, who's the woman in the photograph? Is that your wife? - Yes, that's Margaret. She died three years ago. - Oh, I'm so sorry. It looks like you two were very much in love. - Oh yes, we traveled everywhere together, and every summer a different place. I'm sorry, it's... Did I uh, tell you that I taught Robert biology about a hundred, a hundred years ago. Something's not right. - Yes, unfortunately for you, Mr. Gleason, your choice of physicians. (Orville breathing heavily) - I don't understand. Brad? - Actually, Robert. (glass shatters) He's a murderer, you know. (tense music) You didn't take Ivisol Mr. Gleason, it was Digitol. You're very allergic to Digitol. - Mrs. Steward. - Liza, sh. - Please. - Look on the bright side. Soon, you're gonna be on the most wonderful journey of them all, with Margaret. - Why? - Justice, Mr. Gleason, justice. (tense music) (Orville gasping) (doorbell rings) Sh. Sh, sh, sh, sh. (knocking at door) (doorbell rings) Let go, Mr. Gleason, let go. Sh. (Orville groaning) (deep tense music) (slow somber music) Say hello to Margaret for me. (eerie music) - I wanna draw all the roses in the backyard. The red ones and yellow ones, they're my favorites. Leah, do you think I can get some watercolors for Christmas? - [Leah] Maybe. - Sure makes a man feel proud, real proud. My stepson wants watercolors for Christmas. - Ruben's a good artist. - Yeah? Well, you think if I got him a pink football he'd play with it? - You know, every day I thank God that you're not our real father. You just live here. - Don't you smart mouth me, girl. Ah, ah, uh, uh. - If you ever try to hurt him again, Wayne, I'll come into your room at night when you're sleeping, and I'll cut your throat. (Liza gasps) - It's okay, I'm sorry, it's just me. (Liza groans) I'm sorry. Are you all right? - Oh, Brad, I had an awful dream. Oh there was, oh there, there was someone trying to hurt you and I had a, I had a knife, and oh. - It's okay. It's okay, we're home now. I'm here and you're safe. - I think I might be pregnant. - Really? - I should know for sure in a few days. - Oh, that's wonderful. - [Liza] Mm. - That's wonderful. - Daddy. (both laugh) (scary music) - Grandpa? (keys clatter) Grandpa? (tense music) - You know, we make a pretty good team. - Oh well, we'll see when it's diaper time and 4:00 a.m. feedings. - Ah, who are we kiddin'? Our kids are gonna be so smart that they'll-- (telephone ringing) That they'll feed themselves and change their own diapers. (Liza laughs) Hello. (deep somber music) - [Maryanne] I found my grandpa laying on the ground. I tried to call Brad. - Okay, I'm gonna get going right now. - [Maryanne] Thank you. - What is it? - Um, that was Orville Gleason's granddaughter. Orville's dead. She just found his body. - Oh that poor, sweet man. - Yeah, she was trying to find Brad, she can't locate him. I, I, I gotta get going. I've known that man most of my life. (Liza sighs) (somber music) Maryanne, I'm so sorry. - Thank you. The emergency people were here and they said cardiac arrest. - Oh, is there anything I can do? - The mortuary is on its way. Would you excuse me for a minute? - Sure. (people chattering) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (tense music) (pills jiggling) (suspenseful music) - Good morning, doctor. - Judith. I need to see Orville Gleason's file. - I'll bring it to your office. - Hey, is Brad in? - He's on his way from the hospital. - Okay. (tense music) (knocking at door) 'Kay, thanks. Oh god, no. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah, come in, Brad. Close the door. (door clicks shut) - [Brad] What's wrong? - Orville Gleason is dead. - What? I saw him yesterday, he was fine. - Orville suffered a fatal reaction to Digitol. - Digitol, why would he take that stuff? It was poison to him. - Then why'd you write him a prescription for it? - No, no, no, no, no, Ivisol, I prescribed him Ivisol. - Your handwriting, Brad. - That's impossible. - No, it's not impossible, goddammit, there it is in black and white. - Uh, excuse me, doctor. - [Brad] I know what I wrote. - [Judith] Uh, I'm so sorry to interrupt. - Yes, Judith. - [Judith] It's Helen for Dr. Robert. - Put her through. - [Helen] Robert, hello? - He's gonna need to call you back, Helen. This is a really bad time. - [Helen] Okay. - Excuse me. - Thank you. (tense somber music) - Oh no. - Okay, so let's see, there has been a, a mistake. All right, people make mistakes. I make a mistake myself every once in awhile. (chuckles) - Yeah, when you make a mistake, people don't die. - Brad, I gotta ask you this, 'cause I, I know you've been goin' through a rough patch lately. So is it possible that you were self-medicating on the day that-- - Oh Jesus, Ted, why don't you talk like a human being? What are you asking me? Was I high? Was I taking drugs? Was I under the influence? Because if that's what you're asking, why don't you just come out and ask it? - Okay, Brad, I'm asking. - No, no, no drugs, Bobby. You have to believe me, both of you, you have to believe me. - Brad, it's not a matter of believing you or not believing you. I'm your lawyer. It's my job to prepare you for the worst. Now if there were no drugs, no problem. - Ted, Ted-- - But if there were drugs, it's a big problem. And for you too, my friend. - There were no goddamn drugs, goddammit, goddammit! - Brad, stop it. Stop it, Brad. Brad, Brad, stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it. - Okay, god. Okay, okay. - Okay good, no drugs. - Good. - So worst case is a big malpractice suit. What about family, they always got family. - Yes. - Are they aware of the details? 'Cause if they are, we'll deal with it. But if they're not, we're home free. - No, goddammit, we are not home free. We're responsible. A terrible thing has happened, we are responsible. We're gonna take the fuckin' responsibility. - [Brad] Bobby's right. - Why? Bobby, honor? You, you do the right thing, and then everybody and his cousin gets to clobber the shit outta ya? - Ted, exactly, honor. Some people can't live without it. - Honor in a dishonorable world. You're a fuckin' museum piece. What about you, Brad? - Same museum. - I'm sorry to interrupt. - No, it's all right, I'm, I'm going. Everybody's upset. Guess my, my job is done for the day. (chuckles) - I'll see ya to the door, Ted. - Such a crazy day. I, I wasn't feeling well and Rachel called. - It was my fault, Brad. - Jesus, God. I killed a man. (tense somber music) - Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a minute? - Sure. (tense somber music) - Everyone at the office noticed that Brad was a little out of it yesterday. - He said he wasn't using drugs. - And I believe him. That's not what has me worried. I just don't think he should be alone right now. - Yeah. - I was thinking he could stay with us. Just until things sort themselves out. - (chuckles) You're incredible. (deep somber music) Hey buddy. The, the next few weeks are gonna be pretty tough, so what do you say that you quit living on microwave cooking for awhile, we'll go back to your place, pack a few bags, and come back here and you can stay up in the guest room for as long as you like. - What about Liza? - It was her idea. (insects chirping) - [Helen] Are you sure you can't stay? - No, I'd better get going. (sighs) Who am I kidding. I wasn't gonna tell you anything, but I have to tell you. - What? - She's taking birth control pills. - Liza? - Taking birth control pills, and at the same time talking babies and basinets with Dr. Robert. - Are you sure about this? - (sighs) I found them weeks ago. This woman, she lies the way you and I breathe oxygen. But hey, I'm just a disgruntled ex-employee. Who's gonna listen to me? - Oh. - (sighs) It's all up to you. - Who's gonna listen to me? Disgruntled ex-wife. - Oh. (door clicks shut) - Again, if you need anything of mine, you know, blades or aftershave or something, just holler. Brad, you know I'm on your side, right? - I know. I'm, I'm gonna give it some thought. The, the shrink idea. - Good, it's gonna be like old times, isn't it? You down the hall. - Yeah (chuckles), like old times. Listen I, I gotta call some people, let 'em know where I am. What can I say, both of you. - You're family Brad. Nothing's more important than family. - A mistake? At the drug store, maybe. - No, the mistake was on our end. - [Helen] You don't remember writing it? - What I remember, what I, (sighs) what I remember is writing a prescription for Ivisol, giving it to Liza and having her fax it to the pharmacy. The reality is, I wrote Digitol. I, I've seen it. It's my handwriting. Helen, what're you doin' tomorrow? I, I need to talk. - Uh, no, I, I, I can't tomorrow. Um, the day after? We'll go to the beach, early. 10:30? - Sounds good. - Brad, I'm glad you called. - Thanks. (Helen sighs) (tense music) - Uh, Robert. - Jesus, Helen. - I need to talk to you. - I'm sorry, this isn't a very good time, okay? - No, no, please. I heard about Mr. Gleason and Brad. (sighs) I'm sorry. - Thank you, but that's not why you're here, is it? - This is awkward, (chuckles) waylaying you, but, but I called the office. It's about Greta. - Stay out of it, Helen. - Greta is not a thief, and you know it. - Liza found Greta in possession of stolen jewelry. Now why the hell would she lie about something like that? - I don't know, but I think she did. - Just don't go there, Helen, please. - Will you just think about it? Please, just think about it. Greta has worked faithfully in your house for 12 years, not a problem. You've been married to Liza for just a few weeks. I know how this must sound coming from me, but-- - You just called my wife a liar. I think this conversation is over. - Well one of them is a liar. - Helen, you know who you sound like? - Who? - The old pre-therapy Helen. The one I was married to. The one I couldn't live with. (eerie music) (insects chirping) (Helen sighs) - Oh, stay out of it, Helen, just stay out of it. (Helen sighs) - Hm, you know what? I think I hear voices. - Voices? Twins? - Yeah. Wouldn't that be nice? - Would that make you happy? - Very. - Then twins it is. (Robert chuckles) (tense music) - What smells good? - Oatmeal. Whenever I was sick or feeling low, my stepdad used to make me oatmeal, with lots of milk and sugar. - Sounds like a really nice guy. - The best, just like my husband. - Take care of my brother. - I will. (tense music) I'll take really good care. (suspenseful music) Knock, knock, knock. Wake up, sleepy head. (Brad groans) Lucky you, breakfast in bed. - Oh, I would've come down. - Oh, nonsense, I like spoiling people. And you know Robert, he's always in such a hurry. - Robert doesn't know how lucky he is, huh? - Well that's very sweet. Well, eat it while it's still hot. And you'll feel much better, I promise. - Liza's special medicine, huh? - You bet. Let me know if you need anything else. (somber music) (telephone rings) - [Judith] Mr. Vance on three. - Give me some good news, Ted. - Your bill's in the mail. - Yeah, very funny. - Funniest thing I could think of. Listen, I called about Gleason's granddaughter. She's filed the expected malpractice suit, thanks to some unsolicited information from a pair of honorable assholes, who shall remain nameless. - How can I stand you? - [Ted] Because I have a magnetic personality. Talk to you later. (deep tense music) (Brad groans) - I don't feel so hot. - What's wrong, Brad? - (groans) Breathing, just breathing, is hard. Call a doctor. I think I'm going, I'm going into shock. - Actually Brad, you're overdosing on a controlled substance. (slow somber music) - The food. (tense mysterious music) - Morphine, lots and lots of it. Do you know easy it is to get drugs these days? A day trip to Tijuana, that's all. - Why, Liza? - Because your brother's a murderer. Now they say you lose control of your bowels. I hope not, I think that's such an indignity. - I don't understand. - The innocent never do. (doorbell rings) (tense suspenseful music) Helen, what a pleasant surprise. - Well didn't Brad tell you? We're going to go to the beach. - No, he didn't mention it. Oh, it's a shame you didn't call first, he's still sleeping. - Well, he was expecting me. Well, I'd like to speak to him. - [Brad] Helen, Helen! - Was that Brad? (dramatic music) (gasps) Oh Brad, Brad. Call an ambulance. - Is he dead? - Hurry, dammit! Oh, Brad. Oh god, please be all right, be all right. - [9-1-1 Operator] 9-1-1. - Yes, this is an emergency. - So he was using drugs all along. That son of a bitch lied to me. - He was in pain, Robert. More pain than we imagined. You can't blame yourself. - He was my kid brother. Big brothers are suppose to take care of kid brothers. - You took care of him. - Yeah. (tense music) - Brad Steward died of a drug overdose. He has been a drug abuser for a long time. - [Man] Did his brother know about this? - Yes, everyone in his office was aware of it. - [Man] Did he ever see patients while intoxicated? (eerie music) (birds chirping) (people chattering) - I had to pay my respects. - I'm glad you came. - Hi, Helen. - Well, I see some people I know, so excuse me. - Can we step outside a minute? - Sure. I still don't know what happened to him, Ted. - [Ted] Meaning? - I don't know, maybe it was a suicide. I, I just don't know. - Well, whether it was a suicide or an overdose, it's your word on his past behavior that's at issue. You swore he was not using at the time of Gleason's death. - Because I believed he wasn't. - I gotta be frank with you, Robert, this could go either way. - What're you talking about? - State medical board. They received an anonymous phone call. Claimed that Brad had been using for a long time, claimed it was public knowledge. They wanna see you. Friday, ten o'clock. You sure you didn't know? - Fuck you, Ted. - I had to ask. (dog barking) (people chattering) - [Man] The office called. - [Woman] You know actually, I forgot, I was suppose to have an appointment today. (woman continues speaking quietly) (deep somber music) - Well, well, well, if it isn't Leah Tyman. - Who the hell are you? - I'm disappointed. I'd sure as shit remember someone I tried to choke to death. - You must be mistaken. (Felicia laughing) - No, sweetheart. If you'd have hung in there just 30 seconds longer, would've been all she wrote. But I survived. I told the cops all about you. They thought I was delirious, a mental case. So I figured it was up to me, and here I am. Took some time, but you'd be surprised what a great motivator anger is. But then I could probably learn a lesson from you where that's concerned. Do you have any onion dip? - All out. - It's a very nice house you have. And married to a doctor, hurray for you. And I'll be damned if it's not the same doctor that CPR'd me back to life. Kissy lips, as I recall. Do you think it'd be all right if I just went in there to talk to him? Say howdy. I do owe the man my life. - Let's take this outside. (people chattering) How much? - That is so cynical. You know, if you ask me, that's the trouble with the world today. Hundred thousand. - How much? - Hundred thousand, cash, day after tomorrow. Give you a little time to get it together. - And how am I suppose to come up with that kind of money? - I'm an optimist. I'm sure you're gonna find a way. - Just answer one question. When you were out there driving that day, probably with a couple of drinks under your belt, huh, sweetie, did you see anything? I mean, before you killed him, did you even see him? - I wasn't the only resident of the sunshine state that had a few too many that afternoon, Leah. It was Labor Day weekend. Would've been un-American not to. (Felicia talks quietly) - Excuse me. - About the money. - I'll bring it to your motel. - You're very funny. Now let's get serious. You know Rancho Park? - Yeah. - There's a swing set behind the gym. 2:00 p.m., Thursday. And sweetheart, don't do anything I wouldn't do. (deep somber music) - Fucking whore bitch. - That woman that you were talking to outside, I don't recall meeting her. Is she a friend of yours? - Just an acquaintance. - Oh. Just passing through? - Were you eavesdropping, Helen? - Yeah, guess I was. - That's it, get out. Out of my kitchen, out of my house, out of my life. - What the hell is going on? - I'm not exactly sure, Robert. Perhaps Liza here can fill us in. - Oh, I want her out, Robert. - My god, Helen. Can I just bury my brother, please? (tense somber music) (Liza sighs) Look at me, not a tear. - They'll come, darling. They always do. - Oh, I'm just so pissed off at him. Not only did he ruin his life and his brilliant career but, did I ever tell ya that he was a better doctor than I am? - Things'll work themselves out. - He was. On top of the lawsuit, the state medical board wants to see me. My license to practice is now in question. If they decide that I knew that Brad was using drugs when he was treating Orville then, I face possible criminal charges. - They say we get what we deserve. - What? - They say we get what we deserve. If that's true, things will work out for both of us. (eerie music) - [Felicia] I wasn't the only resident of the sunshine state that had a few too many that afternoon, Leah. It was Labor Day weekend. Would've been un-American not to. - Here I come, Liza. Leah. Whoever the hell you are. (computer beeps) - How long will you be gone? - Well, Jerry Kalb's filling in for me at the hospital. I still haven't found anybody to take the remaining patients. - Things'll work out. - Thanks. (tense music) But I wouldn't count on it if I were you. - So what, 73 years old? No, no, no, that was not the information I was given, no. Thanks, bye. Scratch Palm Beach. (computer beeps) (people chattering) (suspenseful music) (door handle jiggles) - Dammit. (suspenseful music) - [Man Over Radio] Rydell, go to channel three. (suspenseful music) Scott, it looks like we've got a disturbance at the basketball court, meet me over there. (tense suspenseful music) - You shouldn't smoke, Felicia. (Felicia gasping) It's such a nasty habit. (Felicia gasping) Potassium chloride. First comes the heart attack. Then you die. No fuss, no muss. (tense music) Well, I gotta go. I've got big things cookin' tonight. (eerie music) (tense suspenseful music) (Robert breathing heavily) How are you holding up? - I took a drive out to the beach. I just wanted to clear my head. It was, it was maybe the worst afternoon of my life. I wanted to quit, you know, I just wanted to pack the whole thing in. But then, I thought about you. About you, and how much I love you. And I thought about our baby. And I realized I can't quit. I'm gonna fight, Liza. - I'm proud of you, Robert. Well, why don't you go wash your hands. Dinner'll be ready soon. - Thanks. Mm. - One, Felicia Laurel, on her way home from a Labor Day barbecue, killed some guy on a, on a bicycle, named Ruben Tyman. Right on Route 11 near the airport. Both were taken to Tallahassee General. Oh, this is great. The lady claimed someone attacked her while she was hooked up to the respirator. Probably someone in accounting. (laughs) - (sighs) Did anything come of the allegations? - [McGovern] Not that I'm aware of, no. - This um, Felicia Laurel, does it say anywhere what she looked like? - Nope, you got a fax number? - Yeah, I sure do, 818-555-0186. - Okay, if I find any information, photos on anybody, I'll fax you. - Thanks, appreciate it. - [McGovern] You're welcome. (dial tone blaring) (mysterious music) - I don't know how to tell you this, Robert, but I'm not pregnant. - [Robert] What? - I'm not pregnant. - (breathing heavily) Oh my god, Liza. Liza, I'm so sorry. Well, there'll be other chances. - I wouldn't count on it. - What do you mean? - Is something wrong, Robert? - I don't know, I, I just, (Liza laughs) I don't feel... (Robert groans) - Let's go get some air, come on. Come on. (giggling) - [Robert] Why are you laughing? - 'Cause you're funny, Robert, you're really funny. You know you look like a rag doll. Come on. - Wait, wait, wait, I gotta, I gotta sit down. (telephone ringing) (Robert groans) - Hello. - [Ted] It's Ted, can I speak to Robert? - You know, Ted, he's resting right now and I really don't wanna bother him. (Robert groans) I'm really worried about him. - Liza. - He's not feeling very well. - Liza. - Tell him to hang in there. - Okay, okay. (phone clicks off) (Robert groans) That was Ted. He suggests that you get a good night's rest so you can be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for the hearing. But I've got different plans for you, darling, dear. That funny feeling in your head, that's a roofie, the date rape drug. But don't worry, I'm not gonna rape you, I'm gonna kill you. (dramatic swishing) - [Woman] Yeah, I was on duty that night. I remember there was this doctor from California. He saved a woman's life. Look, I'm in a big hurry. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, um, was his name, Steward? - [Woman] Okay, okay, let, let me look here real fast. Let's see, Steward, yeah, Dr. Robert Steward. Listen, I hope this helps but I really have to go now. Take care, honey. Bye-bye. (haunting music) - Let's go. Come on, up, come on. Woo, now the fun begins. - Liza, what? - Mr. McGovern, I have just received your fax, thank you. I have one question. Did Ruben Tyman have a girlfriend? Pretty, sort of early 30s? - Not that I'm aware of, but uh, he did have a, a sister that fits that description. I remember her from the hospital. Blonde, really broken up, a looker. Uh, name of uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Leah. (Helen gasps) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (tense music) - One year ago, on a lonely country road, you made a decision that cost a young man his life. His name was Ruben Tyman. - Yeah. - You recognize him? (Robert grunts softly) Now look at me. I'm Ruben Tyman's sister. (car door bangs) Answer this. You have an accident and two people are hurt. Why in God's great universe would you save the drunk who caused the accident and let the innocent victim die? Huh? What, you liked her? You thought she was pretty? Ladies first? - I did the right thing. - [Liza] Do you have any idea how I felt? How desperately alone I was? - I did the right thing. - He was everything to me and you took him away. - I did the right thing. (suspenseful music) - I knew I had to kill you. I just needed to figure out how. I imagined myself killing you in a hundred different ways. So with a new purpose, I began planning your death. But then I realized, killing you wasn't enough. Before I killed you, I had to empty your life. Learned a lot about you on the web, you and Brad. Meeting you was easy enough. Moved to LA, bumped into you at a reception after one of your dreary lectures. Men are such fools when a pretty woman wets her lips and bats her eyelashes, and hangs on their every word. (suspenseful music) The hardest part was in bed. Every time you touched me I thought I'd die of disgust. You make my skin crawl. (car engine revving) Oh, before you lose consciousness, we should maybe clear up a few things. Brad didn't kill Orville Gleason, I did. And of course I killed Brad too. - Oh god. - That's right. - My god. - I killed your beloved brother. And Nora too, but I took no pleasure there. But seeing the esteemed Dr. Robert Steward take the easy way out after losing it all, you know that's what they're gonna think. About to drown in his own vomit, that's what makes this all worthwhile. You still love me, Robert? (eerie music) You still think I'm the perfect wife? (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Helen, I didn't hear you knock. - I rang the bell, the door was open. - And you just let yourself in. - Oh you just cut the crap. What's going on here? Where's Robert? (tense music) - [Liza] Robert isn't here. - I know about you, Leah. I know about your brother. I know about Felicia Laurel. - Just couldn't keep your nose out of it, could you, Helen? (adventurous music) - This won't bring your brother back. - It'll make it a lot easier to sleep at night. (adventurous music) (tense music) (adventurous music) (women grunting) (Robert grunts) (tires squealing) (Liza gasps) (tense music) (tires squeal) (Liza grunting) - Robert. Robert. (tense music) Robert! Robert, Robert. Oh god. (slow mysterious music) So there it is, hits the bookstore next week. - [Robert] Helen, this is wonderful. - [Helen] I start my promotional tour in New York, and well then I get to go all over the country, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta. - [Robert] You must be so proud. - Yeah, I am. You should read it. - Oh, I will. - Well when, when you get the time. - Maybe when you get back we can go out to a movie or, or a concert or something. - Maybe. I'll get some more to drink. - That "maybe" is that a "yes maybe" or a "no maybe?" - Maybe. (Robert chuckles) Leaning toward a yes. I'll be back. - Hm. This is good, Helen, really good. - Shame on you, Robert. (dramatic music) With my back turned and with your ex-wife. How drab. Helen. (Helen gasps) Over there with Robert. (tense music) - This is between you and me, Liza. Let Helen go. - Oh, that's very chivalrous of you, Robert, but I'm gonna have to say no. Back off! (Helen gasps) - I may have made a mistake, Liza, but I don't think so. Your brother died of massive cerebral trauma. His brain was soup. There's nothing I could've done. - Don't say that. (gunshots blast) (Helen yells) (dramatic music) (gunshot blasts) (tense music) (Helen gasps) (Helen breathing heavily) - Call 9-1-1, Helen. I'm okay, go on, call 9-1-1, right now. - He was an artist. (Helen breathing heavily) - Hello, please, please, someone's been shot. We need an ambulance, quickly. (tense mysterious music) (Robert grunts) (deep somber music) (Liza coughs) (deep somber music) - No. Why didn't you let me die? - Because I'm a doctor. (tense music) (gentle mysterious music) (sirens blaring) (gentle mysterious music) (deep adventurous music) (gentle mysterious music) (bold orchestral music)
