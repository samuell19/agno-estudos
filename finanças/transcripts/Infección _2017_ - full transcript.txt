Do you have more of what you gave me? The other day? Give me the needle. Where is the needle? Damn! Where is the damn needle? Damn! Hey... Is it good? What is it? Dimitri... What is it? What are you doing? What are you doing? No Carlos, I can't. We're moving to Merida. Mm-hmm. No... I... I'll call you back later. Ready? Are you feeling alright? - You've got everything? - Yes. Are you sure? Listen to your grandpas, ok? Don't worry, Adán, it's just a week. Yes, I know... We just haven't been apart since Blanca's... I miss her so much... Hey, kid, hold on to your plane. Help me out with the baggage. Doctor! Johnny... How are you? Fine, thank you. How's Miguel? He went away with his grandparents. To a country house in Aragua. Well... good night. Well... Doctor... Some potato soup won't hurt you... if you'd like. So Miguelito went on a trip, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah... My in-laws haven't spent time with him since Blanca died. They got horses there... It will be fun for him. That's really good... Horses are great! I used to ride a lot when I was a kid... Maybe I'll buy one someday. ¿So... are you going to take me to town on a horse? Of course I will... on a horse ride. Because this world was made on a horse. Eat some more, Doctor. - Thanks. - It's not much because... vermin are damaging the crops. Excuse me. Doctor, do you want some "Miche"? It's the plant louse... We tried everything... but nothing works. Look... The plants are healing themselves. Ladybugs are eating the plant louse. That's nature... It always finds a way. Hey! How are you? Did you brush your teeth? - Yes. - Yeah. Are you sure? Is there any room for me? Look, it's time. Dad... It's too early. Can I sleep here? No, you've slept here the whole week. It's enough. Ok, fine. Get under the sheets. Come on. Are you leaving already? Yeah, I have to rush to the airport, I'm late to catch my flight. What happened? He was ran over and he has no documentation. Get him a line. Take him to the E. R., go. Are you ok? What happened? A man bit him. Good morning. Hello, Blanca here... I can't answer right now, but please leave your message. - Blanca... - Hmm? What are you doing? Nothing, just hanging your diplomas here, so your patients can see them. But my patients here don't care about that... And I don't practice that kind of medicine anymore... Then... Let's put them here for me. Mrs. Mary, good morning. Good morning... Give me a second. Please. Has you been resting? Of course I have, Doctor. Are you sure? Yes, I went to town only twice. Mrs. Mary, I see you down the road, every morning while I drink coffee. You know I don't like being in my bed... all day. And your grandson? Hasn't he come? No, he's too busy... Well... You need to get some rest... Otherwise it's not going to work. Come. Easy now. Calm down! Calm down! Come, come... Get away from him. Come here. Get out! Get out! Calm down! Calm down! Control yourself! Control yourself! No! Control yourself! No! No! Carlos! The first report came from two days ago, at a public hospital in Caracas. The man was arrested for assault and have the symptoms. Neurological disorder... Paranoia, hallucinations, seizures. And what about the hospital? What did the doctor on duty have to say? There is not communication. The hospital is in quarantine. Where any samples taken? Doctor! Ok. We'll contact the UN. This is a level four. Hello... Hello, son. How are you? How was the trip? Hello, Dad! I was just riding a horse with grandpa, but he said it was enough for today because the horses are tired. Yeah, Miguel, you can't ride a horse all day long. Are you listening to your granny? Did you eat something? Yes, a cookie. A cookie? Do you call that food, Miguel? Hey, dad, I saw six military aircrafts passing by the house. My grandma is calling me. Ok, behave yourself. Ok, bye... God bless you. I'm coming! Bolivarian System of Communication and Information through the Simon Bolivar Satellite broadcast, this message of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Hey, man! What are you doing? Give that back! Man! Don't touch him! You'll get sick! Why are you shooting? Put the gun down! Venezuela is at peace, all the country in producing, working... despite the desperation and madness of certain little groups trying to get the attention of the world by small outbreaks... in order to provoke an intervention, with this little outbreaks... They've not achieved their goal... What happened? I don't know. She said an old man bit her. Then she went to bed, she wasn't feeling ok. Now she's acting weird. Let's take her... to the house. When did this happen? I don't know... A while ago... I don't know. How long exactly? I don't know, an hour and a half... We need to do something, Doctor. What do we do? Oh, God... Help me, help me! Let me go! I'll be right back. Hello, Adán... Sorry I missed your call, my phone was failing... Do not get out of your homes, and do not get in touch with anyone. How many people have you counted? Do you know how it is transmitted? It looks like it's transmitted by the mucosal and the bloodstream... What are the symptom? Shoot that, look! Shoot it! We don't know yet... What kind of virus is this? We don't know now, this is a new pathology. We can't say anything without any tests and results. What is it? She's not responding... I don't know what to do. Johnny, she's sedated, take it easy. Come on in. Put her on the couch. Doctor, is it a viral or bacterial disease? I don't know, we can't talk without proof. Doctor, people are calling it "the zombie virus", tell me... Is this because...? - Hello, doctor, how are you? - Good evening, Doctor, how are you? We just saw Johnny running with Ana. Are they here? Yes, come on in. Hello, Johnny. Hi. Doctor... She's responding. Let me see... Hold her! Show me. Are you ok? Show me. Don't worry, it's nothing. Juan, are you ok? Yeah, yeah... - Are you sure? - Don't worry, it's nothing, I mean it. Hello, Tina... It's Adán... Please, call me urgently. How is Miguel? Call me back when you hear this, please. We strongly recommend to our listeners to remain in our homes... If any family member present symptoms like fever, hallucinations or aggressiveness. Please, isolate that person and call 911 immediately... for medical assistance. We strongly recommend to our listeners to remain in our homes... If any family member present... My God, I don't understand what's happening... There's no internet. Hello, Carlos... Can you hear me? Carlos... Can you hear me? Carlos... I'm in my house, Carlos. Everyone was evacuated from the lab for security measures. We are near the city. Carlos, I can't hear you. Hello? Carlos! I'm sending you the coordinates. I need you to come here. We need all the help possible. Avoid traveling through the cities. I'm trying to call Miguel... He's with his grandparents, in Aragua. Miguel? Caracas is empty in chaos. The place is a mess. ¿Hello...? Ok. I'm listening. We are in quarantine. And we have orders to kill anyone infected. Hello? Quarantine? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos! - Adán? - To kill who? Hola, Carlos? A colleague told me that several places are in quarantine. And there's a curfew. Where? Who are they killing? For what I've seen today I believe... they're trying to contain anyone infected. Contain? - What do you mean contain? - Kill them... Contains means to kill everyone infected. Oh, my God! What are you saying? If we take Ana to the hospital... they're going to kill her? I don't know... I don't know what's going on. I was in town and there was total chaos. I don't understand. Roberto! Roberto? Is you phone working? Roberto? To remain in your homes... If any family member presents symptoms like fever... Please isolate that person... Call 911 immediately for... I don't get what's going on... What are they talking about? What did Roberto say? Is his phone working? Miguel, go put your pajamas. - But, grandpa... - Do as I say, boy! What's the matter with you? Roberto is dead. Be quiet... But how? How can he be dead? Shh. Keep your voice down... I don't know what happened. When I got there, Roberto was in a chair... I think he shot himself. You stay here. And don't open the door to anyone! Grandma, I'm hungry. Ok, sweetie, I'm about to make dinner. Well, I'll be right back. Don't open the door to anyone. Sweetie, come. Let's find some candles. We're heading to the hospital. I'm a Doctor. The road is closed. Please, we got sick people here. Everybody, get out of the car! Hands up, where I can see them! Come on, do it quickly! - Ana! - Infected! Ana! No! Ana! Johnny, get in the car! Watch out! - Johnny, get in the car! - No! Listen to me, now! Get in! What's wrong with those people? I don't know. Why was Ana like that? Please, stop the car. Please, stop the car. - Stop the car! Stop the car! - Why? What's the matter? Johnny! Johnny... What's wrong with those people? Why was Ana like that? I don't know, they got sick with a virus... Something strange... Sick with what? Sick with what? I don't know... Johnny, Johnny... Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm going to find Ana... I know how you feel, but you can't go back there... You know how I feel? I can't leave Ana there like a garbage! You can't go there... I know how you feel... Don't tell me how I feel! Your wife died on her bed, with cancer... She wasn't shot by some bastards! Just because she was sick... Huh. Let's go get Miguel. I'm Dr. Lucy Blake! I'm from the World Health Organization! I know! I am Dr. Carlos Nieves! How long has he been like this? Twenty hours. What did you say the virus was called? People call it, Crocodile virus. Get out of the car, now! Help! Help! - Help me! Help! - No! I'm sorry! Watch out! Hey! Over here! Help! Look, look, look! Help! Hey! Get in! Hurry up! Watch it! Let's go! Did they bite you? Did they bite you? Did they bite you? No... no, no. I don't think so. What's your name? Luis. Where were you going? I don't know. What do we do now? Luis, stop that noise! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Hey, come here! Over here! - If you wouldn't have... - Shh. Shh. Come... Hello... Where do you come from? From Merida... Mérida? What's going on there, guys? How are things there? Everything is chaos... Don't you have any cigarettes? I just have this one left... Go get some rest, we leave early tomorrow to find some water. We're more now. We can help you out, but... We can't stay. Where do you plan to go? A friend is waiting for us not so far from here. But, don't you think it's better if you stay here? Until this is over, at least. I don't think this is going to be over soon. An epidemic like this... Well, do whatever you want... I just have one cartridge left... I'm going to guard the roof. Cristal, daughter, come and close the door. Miguel! Miguelito! Dad! Where are the others? I don't know. Shh. What happened? I'm out of bullets. Where's Johnny? And Luis? We saw a woman with a kid... We tried to help her, but we couldn't do anything. The kid ran away and hid in that room. Come! The kid is in that room. You're friends are there. We have to go get them. Let's go. Open up! Ok, let's go! Close, Cristal! Johnny! Open up! Hurry! What happened? Luis broke his leg. Let's see. - No, no, no... - Hold this. One... Two... Oh, my God, help him... "Our Father, who art in Heaven..." Hey! Hey! Johnny, hand me that rag... - José! José! - No, no, no! José! How's Cristal and José? You got bit? I'm ok. I'm ok. Well, now what? We can't move from here, right? I think we can't stay... But don't you see what just happened? I can't move my leg... But if I go out... Shut up! I said, shut up! What do you want? Ah? Do you want us to stay here? They'll hear us and find us... Is that what you want? Let's do what we came to do... We take some gas and go. Johnny is right, we can't stay here. - But I can't move... - Luis! We'll go for the truck and go where we can treat that injury better. We leave at sunrise. Look, there's a bucket... for the gas. - Go, go, go, go! - Hold him. Let's go. Let's go! Got it? Yes? Let's go. Shh. Don't open. Stay inside. Stay there. What happened? Don't open to anyone, stay inside. Do you hear me? - But, what happened? - You can get infected! Infected with what? What's that on you back, Ángel? Ángel! - Ángel? - I told you not to open! I have no idea of where we are... According to the coordinates we're in the zone. Luis is losing to much blood. Stay here. Luis, turn on the car... Turn on the car! Hey! Hey! No! - Get out of the car! - I can't! Johnny, help him out! Luis! Get out! No! Help me! Help me! Luis! Put the gun down! Did you get bit? We're not infected. Dr. Carlos Nieves asked to come here... Take off your clothes! Hurry up! Obey! Do it fast! Where's Miguel? With my in-laws in Aragua. They left before all this started. Are they safe? I don't know... I don't know anything about them since we lost communications. And who is he? My neighbor, Johnny. His wife died a few days ago, infected. Now he's with me. What are you burning? Corpses. Come over here. Eat something, we'll talk later. Let's go. When he finishes eating tell him where the rooms are. This is Dr. Lucy from the World Health Organization. Dr. Vargas took a lot of risk to be here. I asked him to come to collaborate with us. He's one of the best specialists in molecular medicine. Can I talk to you in private? Excuse me. Excuse me. Carlos, I can't stay here... What do you mean? I was on my way to find Miguel, I just came here because this guy who was with us was wounded, but.. Haven't you seen enough? It's too dangerous to be outside... I can't stay here while Miguel is out there... We're close to Ground Zero. Do you know what that means? Going there... it's suicide. This is it? Yes. It is a Lyssa virus type... But... Which genotype is this? It's a macro mutation. A new genotype of the rabies virus. Number 12. But rabies is one of the most stable viruses that exist. I don't get it. Soldier... Yes, Captain! What are you doing here? Why aren't you in your guard's place? Captain, Doctor Nieves asked me... Corporal, who's your superior officer? You are, Captain! Then, what the fuck do I care about what the doctor says? Are you a doctor or a soldier? - Captain... - A doctor or a soldier? - I'm a soldier, Captain! - Get out of here! - Go to your guard position. - Understood Captain! How did rabies mutate like this? I haven't figured that out yet. This virus has a completely different chart. Witch drug was found in the first examination that you mentioned? Dismorphine... Dismorphine. What if the host was infected with rabies at the same time... that the drugs started to take effect? Have you tested it under those conditions? When the virus has no quadrant of comparison it tries to... to simulate a similar virus. Tries to find cause through similar conditions. Exactly. Go fast! What about the immune population? What's the percentage? As it now, zero. All the samples are from adults? Where are the kids? - Infected! - Infected! Open fire! Fuentes! Ramírez! Fire at will! Stay in your positions! Come on! Infected! Watch out! Watch out! Dr. Nieves, over here! Come on! Give me that weapon... Come on! We can't give a weapon to a civilian! The infected don't know if I'm a civilian - or a soldier you asshole! - Johnny, come on! Johnny! Luis? Ramírez y Fuentes, check the area. Ramírez! Ramírez! We're going to Fort Tiuna! That's the only safe place. We can get there tonight. No, no. Wait a moment. Doctor, if we contact the WHO, how long would it take to get some help? That's impossible. The borders were closed days ago. Did you know this? Yes. My family was evacuated, along with other people, a week ago. We're alone in this... We need to go to the Scientific Institute and finish the job. You didn't listen. We're going to Fuerte Tiuna because we're going to Fuerte Tiuna. We need to finish the job, we can't stay here arguing, waiting for another attack. My orders are to keep you alive... and that's what I'm going to do. Yes? The same way you did with those people back there? Damn, I lost a whole battalion down there! They were my men! My responsibility! Five hours ago... we were about to find a virus analysis... and now it's even more dangerous than before, don't you get it? Captain! Let him go! Drop that weapon! Let him go, Captain. Put the gun down! Shoot! - Johnny, you better shoot... - Put the gun down! We need to go or there will be nothing to save... Get it? Captain! Captain, do you have a family? Think about them... The Doctor is right. If we don't go, there will be nobody to save... Help us to find the cure! Johnny, put the gun down! Fuentes, put the gun down. I need you to stay with them. I need you to help them arrive to the lab. I came with you, not with them. We're going to find Miguel. I know, but I need you to help them now, please. Doctor... This is Jonny, his a great friend. He's going to stay with you. Where are you going? I need to go to get my son. Be careful. This kind of crisis brings out the worst in people. Adán. Take care. Thank you brother. Thanks for everything. Oh, my God... Let's see what he has to say, where is he going... Let's stop the car... Do you have the water? Hello... Where are you going? To la Victoria town... Are you thirsty? We got water. No, it's ok. I have to keep going. Didn't you hear my mom? She offer you water and you're ungrateful. Ungrateful. Ungrateful people bother me. Thanks for the offer, but I'm fine, thank you. Come on, drink some water... Drop it! Drop it! No! No! Damn you! Damn...! Don't do it, ma'am! Don't! Who's there? Help! Mister! Who's there? No, don't shoot! Please, help us! They're crazy! Don't leave us! Help us! Help us, please. Thank you. Thank you. Where are you going? Do you know this area? - No. - Can we go with you? - No. - Where are we, sir? The highway to Valencia. Take us with you... Please, mister, I'm begging you! Please... Do you have any place to go? No. We were heading south on a bus... but a sick guy started biting everybody. The driver stopped, we got hit by a car, and we ran from there. Why were you heading south? There's a lot of sick people where we live... Someone told us it was safe down there. That's why we were going to the plains... I have an uncle in Apure. I got to find my son a few miles from here... If you don't mind that, you can come along... No, we don't mind. We want to go with you. It's ok. Well, get in the truck. Thanks. Could you please stop for a moment? Why? What's the matter? I'm not feeling right, please. No, I can't. Is too dangerous here. We need to stop, please. I don't feel right. Just a moment. Is she infected? Let me see. No, she doesn't have any symptoms. She's just dehydrated. Let's try to find some water on the way. Baby, I have to tell you something. What is it? I didn't know how to tell you, because you were angry... but, I'm pregnant... How far is the institute, Doctor? Behind that mountain. Where are we, Doctor? It's not far. Let's find another car. What car? We'll go walking. They're running from the infected! Come on! Come on! Keep going... Come on! Help! Let us in! Let us in! Let us in! Let us in! Open the door! No! Doctor! No! Let me go! - Hey! - Let us in! - Hey! - I can't let you in! I can't! I'm from the World Health Organization! Open the door! Open the door! - Let us in! - Open the door! Come on, go, go! Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! Ángel... Miguel... Miguel. Miguel. Dad. Miguel... Son, when were you bitten? When did they bite you? Yesterday. Grandma told me to stay here and not to open the door. You're going to be fine... You'll be fine. Hey, stop, stop! Wait! Please, stop! Help me! - What happened? - I need help... - What is it? - I got something here. Are you ok? Where are you going? Over here to the IVIC. Is that kid alright? - Infected! - No! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Adán! Adán! Let the kid go! Let him go! Adán! Adán! When I get better, we're going to travel. The three of us. Adán! Don't fall asleep! Adán! Don't fall asleep! Dad! If anybody is listening... I'm a nurse from Razzetti Hospital. We have no food or water... Very difficult time for Venezuelans... Its 12 hour border opening is a breath for... From all the problem that have been living... There were some kids... They were immune? Exactly! Kids younger than ten years old were immune to the virus... We just didn't notice... Besides chaos aggravate everything even worst... And although this is not connected, there is still ongoing a political crisis... the actions shown by the presidency... Adán, we did it. We created the serum using Miguel's blood and it was effective. It's been distributed around the country. Maduro refuses to receive... I was in San Cristobal. There I found... my buddy. Then, we crossed over the border. Then we ate some "arepas"... Well, since then, we have been walking for two days... I left Venezuela one year ago. Did you receive treatment? Well, yes... Here, I got the mark. We're going to Peru. We're going to check out if we can work... So we can send money to my parents. They're old so... I have like eight month trying to get a fucking passport, and they don't stop asking if I got my vaccine! I'm fine! I'm healthy! I think for security reasons... They shouldn't let Venezuelans enter into Mexico. At least until their situation is solved. They shouldn't come here, right now. That's why there are borders. Well... Yes. I... I get it. But this could happen to Mexicans or Chilean people... I'm looking for work. But... When they see I was infected. Because I was... They reject me, or even kick me out of the bus... Actually for me is a struggle to get food or basic things. I'm just doing the best I can... Despite living close to the border it wasn't easy to get out. After all that has happened... But here we go, we never give up or surrender... I've been here in Ecuador, for one and a half years... You know, just getting by... I'm the only survivor of my family. I was not touched or affected by the infection. But everyone in my house died. I was the only one who made it. Well... Here we are.
