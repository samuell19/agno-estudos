"Arattupuzha Velayudha Panikkar was an unsung renaissance hero who has long been neglected by historians." "He waged an extraordinary struggle against the inhumane system that prevailed in the 19th century." "This is the headquarters of the East India Company in Travancore during that era." What did he say? He said he'll bring you anything you ask for. Anything?! Hey, black beauty... Come forward. He's asking the pretty black woman to come forward. Achu Pillai, isn't she the slave girl who was owned by Chandu Kurup? Yes, the same lowbred lass. I bought her from Chandu Kurup for a whopping 300 coins. Apparently, our Henry Sahib from Madras, prefers black women. And it was none other than Nicholas Sahib who told me this! Aha! That is why I made her shower and be presentable to bring her here. Would you look at that! A lowbred lass who never covered her breasts all her life, is now wearing a blouse! Well, Sir Henry is not particularly fond of women with unclothed breasts. It seems he won't get aroused if the chest is bare. Well! Where the hell are the wrestlers? I love the black-skinned macaques in duel. But make sure, in the end, the winner kills the loser. Oh! What did he just say? He's saying that the slave wrestling should start immediately! And that the winner must kill the loser! Oh! - Fine! Summon them! - Yes, right away. We need to keep them happy to get our things done. Ready, Sahib! What's it? I am here to see Lord Kaimal. - Did he ask you to come here? - Yes. But a chief here told me that I won't be able to see him now. I came before dusk. - Where are you coming from? - From Arattupuzha. Perumalachan told me to come. Oh! So you are Perumalachan's son? I'm his grandson. The lord had offered to help me get a permit from Henry Sahib for exporting cardamom. Kaimal will be inside. Please come. The lord must have taken a tidy sum as a bribe to get you the permit. Am I right? Don't you want to meet Kaimal? - Come inside. - But... Are people like me allowed to come in? Won't that be an act of desecration? Sahibs don't follow such customs in their bungalows. Untouchability, desecration etc., is followed only in our land. You may come inside. Argh! - Come, man! - Come on! Come! I bought him for 600 coins. If you don't win this duel, I'll chop your head off! I bought him for 750 coins. He will kill the slave and his master if needed. Beat him to death! Beat him! Beat him! Come on! Crush him! Come on! They are slaves bought by the lords. This will end only when one of them dies. How dare you! Give me that! Go and thrash him! Go on! Wasn't there a proclamation to stop this slave trade? Proclamations have been issued since 1812. What's the point of proclamations, if people don't change? The masters need slaves. Crush him, just like that! I was waiting for you, Lord Peshkaar. Be seated. He has come to see you, Lord. He is the grandson of Arattupuzha Perumal. Don't you know you are supposed to maintain distance and stand away? He said untouchability is not practised here. It's fine for now, considering the place and situation. You may talk to him. Did you give the money bag to my house? Yes, I did. The whole amount? I have given 2000 coins. You wait here. After this is over, I will talk to Sahib. Hey! Go and kill him! What a lovely face you have! This way... Though she is a slave girl, it's her first time. She will be lucky if she survives the night. Kill him. Kill him! - Damn it! - Finish him off! I want to see this slave's blood! - Kill him! - Please, no... Kill him now! Kill him! I command you to kill him! I want to see him dying! KILL HIM! No! Don't kill him. Who's this swine? Who let this man in? Tie him up! And whip him until he dies! Lift him up. Bring him here. You! You wanted to see someone die. Watch him die. - Help him! - Sahib! Leave me! How dare you! Go get him. Kill him! Capture him! Don't let him get away! Block the way! Seize him! "During the mid-nineteenth century, at the palace of the King of Travancore." Why was everyone summoned so urgently? Is there an imminent war? Don't know. Seem's like it's something important. Today, the prestige of Travancore has plunged into the depths of hell! Being a ruler, who is also a devotee of Lord Padmanabha, I have failed to protect God's sacred ornaments and stone. It has been so many days and I have not been able to recover the divine ornaments which were stolen by some notorious thief. Hence, what right do I have to continue on this throne? Talk of the realm is that the ideal job for the Travancore army would be that of planting saplings in the fields. It's not a matter of joke. Pachu Panikkar, do you have anything to state? After all, you are the commander-in-chief of the Travancore Army. Your Majesty, so far no clear evidence has been found about the robber who stole the sacred ornaments. Our army, searching far and wide, suspects it is Kochunni, the infamous thief from Kayamkulam. Panikkar, don't narrate fables to save face. What proof do you have to assume that Kochunni stole the divine jewellery? The priests who carried it said they were burgled by thieves in the dark. I am also inclined to think it was Kochunni who came in that darkness. Kaimal, you are not just a landlord. I've entrusted you with some other responsibilities as well. Tell me, do you suspect anyone else? No, my Majesty, that's not what I meant. Please grant me a few more days, your Majesty. I will capture that despicable thief and bring him to your feet. I have been hearing this for days now! Isn't he the one? The leader of the lower caste! Yes, he's the one. Arattupuzha Velayudha Chekavar! Look at him making an entrance grander than a king! He is a millionaire! Look at him entering without permission. Stop there! Where are you off to so hurriedly? I would like to meet His Majesty. It won't be possible to see him today. The royal council meeting is going on. His Majesty holds meetings with low castes every Tuesday. You can come then. Now, leave! I was summoned here, Master. Stop there, I say! How dare you show such insolence! Don't you know that an Ezhavan, a low caste, should maintain 36 feet distance? Keep down that arrogance of your wealth! Get out! But I haven't said anything to provoke your anger, Milord. And what could you possibly say? Your forefathers might have amassed heaps of money by pimping out to the Portuguese and the Dutch. This isn't the place to show it off! Padaveedan Nambi! What are you doing? He is here on the order of His Excellency. Velayudhan, you may come in. You may take a seat, Velayudha Chekavar. What! His Excellency is welcoming him?! Unbelievable! Do not hesitate, Velayudhan. You may sit. Your Majesty, I have no merit for that. I will stand here. It's an honour that I could even enter this imperial court. Damn him, Velayudha Chekavar! He thinks of himself as some mighty warrior! I have heard a lot about your daring adventures. And now, you are a prominent merchant too! It is rumoured that all the cardamom, dried ginger and pepper in Travancore are stashed away in Velayudhan's granary! Pardon me, Your Majesty, I'm just a simple merchant. Velayudhan, you must be aware that the sacred ornaments and stone of Lord Padmanabha's were stolen. In all of Travancore, only Kayamkulam Kochunni is capable of doing something so heinous. Our army has failed to find him or vanquish him. That's the reason I summoned you, Velyudha Chekavar. I believe that you can capture Kochunni and bring him before my eyes. Is he the one to catch Kochunni? Long odds! Your Excellency, it would be good if you could reconsider this decision. The lower caste is forbidden to even look at God's jewels. And to entrust, Velayudhan, who is of the same lower caste, to retrieve those jewels? Touching those jewels would be pollution of purity, a mortal sin! He has a point, Your Majesty. So, was there no pollution of purity or sin when Kayamkulam Kochunni touched those sacred ornaments? If one thinks that way, that is a valid point too. This is a matter of pride for Travancore. All I need to know is Velayudhan's opinion. Do you have the might to face Kochunni? Your Majesty, if you demand, I will capture Kochunni and bring him before you. But if I, the one born in an inferior caste, retrieve the sacred ornaments, it would bring disgrace to these lords. Hence, I beg your forgiveness. Your Highness, do you notice the air of insolence in his speech? We were only mentioning the laws that this kingdom has been following for the last few centuries. Your Highness, how can we rewrite the mandates just for him? If customs are violated, our land will be ruined! Should we deliberately invite a calamity, my King? Please don't break the customs, Your Highness! Exactly! - Kindly reconsider it. - He has a point, Your Highness. Minister, what is your opinion? Your Excellency... When it is a matter of the law and our customs... Your Majesty, I'm here only because you summoned me. I have no words of gratitude for your trust in me. It won't be enough even if I lay down my life for you. I will always be at Your Majesty's beck and call. But I implore, please do not assign this task to me, especially when you have an entire council against me. Please grant me permission to take your leave. Your Highness, he's a felon! I have known him from years ago. Yes, you do. To be precise, eighteen years ago! Shall I divulge your true face to everyone here? It might disfigure you forever! He's lying, Your Majesty! For the attention of the commander-in-chief, lords and governors, today I have taken your opinion into consideration But, capturing Kayamkulam Kochunni and recovering the sacred ornaments is now entirely your sole responsibility. Bear that in mind! What you did was wise, Velayudha Chekavar! Those people who are actively demanding Kochunni's arrest will be the one ratting us out to Kochunni! No one can be trusted. The commander-in-chief has taken an oath to capture Kochunni. Maybe he wishes so, because he is the commander-in-chief. But... What is it? The warlords of Travancore have always been like that, they all have these wishes, but it's in their destiny to fail. I do not understand. I am Kannan Kurup. I am the son of former commander-in-chief, Pappu Kurup. Oh! Glad to have met you. Farewell. Flog their backs with the whips! Let this be a lesson to all those who disobey. Doesn't matter if they drop dead, make sure they are whipped 108 times! Come on, whip them! Oh, no, my daughter! Please stop, Milord! No, Milord! You had the audacity to walk in public wearing a moustache! But you cannot pay the moustache tax! How dare you! Not enough! Strike them harder! Her screams must be heard miles away. Hey, you! Sergeant Raaru Pillai! You only got these two? No, Milord, we have got around ten more. Mostly lowbred women who don't pay the breast tax. They must be the disciples of that wretched witch, Nangeli. Yes, they are. According to the new order, lower caste women who cover up their chests and don't pay the breast tax will not only have their breasts chopped off but also their heads! - Let it be known! - Will tell them. Milord, flogging these women won't be enough. We must capture and behead their leader, Nangeli. I will do what's necessary today itself. Do you have Kizharnelli, the medicinal plant? - Yes, I do. - Give me a bunch. - And a bunch of Ashwagandha too. - Getting them right away. - Vasu Pillai? - Yes. I heard that the army came in search of Kelu's daughter, Nangeli and that if they get hold of her, she would be executed. Is that true? It's true alright. But they couldn't catch Nangeli! Aha! Milords, a large gathering of women are coming this way. - What?! - This way?! O lords, we have dignity too! O lords, we are humans too! Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! O lords, we have dignity too! O lords, we are humans too! O lords, we have dignity too! O lords, we are humans too! That's it! We'll soon see their corpses floating in Vembanad lake. Do we have no right to cover up our shame? Do we have no right to cover up our shame? Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! Shame on you, O lords! Stop! How dare you lowlifes walk through the royal path with your chests covered?! Remove your breast clothes and disperse! O lords, we have dignity too! O lords, we are humans too! Stop it, you uncouth women! Beat them and chase them away! Enough! So you are the lowbred lass, Nangeli, who has mastered the battle moves! I got some other moves you don't know. If you cooperate, I could teach you. I don't have any qualms about untouchability when it comes to that. It's obvious that you were born to a lower-caste woman who was impregnated by some upper-caste man. That's why you are so light-skinned. Oh! So, we cannot be light-skinned? Then the people of your caste who are dark-skinned would have been fathered by slaves? Beware, you bitch! How dare you abuse our forefathers! Is there any lord who can resist this willowy figure and face of yours. You damn filthy wretch, you think you are some princess! You can't bear the sight of us anywhere near you! But you take great pleasure in seeing our naked bodies, don't you? You sleazy, depraved humans! Stop it, you bitch! Do you know who you are talking to? Now watch me chop off her head and let this be a lesson for all of you! I consider it a virtue to behead a sinner like you! Ugh! What a disgrace! It's the first time I hear that beheading a girl is a virtuous deed. What are you doing here? We know how to enforce the laws of the land! Back off! I will go. But do not misuse your power to treat humans like pests. I also have the power to chop your head off for your arrogance! Remember... I will not tolerate your arrogance just because you are rich enough to trot around with prostitutes like her! Take that smugness elsewhere! Attack him! You said the untouchables must keep 36 paces away from you, right? It is not 36, yet! Milord, if my touch has defiled you, go and cleanse yourself in holy water. I will have vengeance! For the time being, save yourself. Don't you dare come to disrobe these destitute people ever again! You have to be careful. Never forget that our enemies are mighty and powerful. Your Highness, sorry for troubling you at this odd hour. There is an important matter to inform you. Tell me. Some untoward incidents took place in Cherthala today. Padaveedan Nambi, the deputy chief of our army, was almost beaten to death by Arattupuzha Velayudhan in public. All that barbarity just because Nambi questioned some lower caste women for covering their breasts. The Village Officer in Cherthala had informed us that no one is paying the mandatory breast tax. Velayudhan is responsible for all this furore. If you give the orders, we can send our army to arrest him. Nowhere else in India will you find such practices! Only in Travancore, you have these breast and moustache taxes. My predecessor, the great uncle, conquered from Kanyakumari in the south to Aluva in the north and expanded our empire. But it was not just our army that helped win those battles, was it? No, the kings from other lands aided us back then. And when there wasn't enough money in the treasury to pay up what was promised to these kings, they decided to impose such taxes. So what if traitors like Velayudhan get those taxes abolished? Don't let him get away with it, Your Majesty! He should be given maximum punishment. If needed, we can give him the death penalty. But, Panikkar, do you know that the properties and assets of high officials and landlords like yourself are exempted from tax? And what about the Devaswom and Brahmaswam?! In short, the rich have no tax. But Velayudhan is not like that. He regularly pays a large sum of money as tax. Moreover, when there is a shortage in the treasury to pay taxes to the British Company, Velayudhan pays his taxes in advance. I shall think about it. For the time being, Pachu Panikkar, you can focus on retrieving Lord Padmanabha's sacred ornaments and protect my pride. Otherwise, I will have to take action against you. Chirukandan, my dear, come quick. I'm almost there, Nangeli. Where are you going with this pot? I was coming to your hut. I didn't see you yesterday. There was cattle ploughing in the paddy field yesterday. And at night, I went to Ambalapuzha with the bullock cart. Lord asked me to do cattle ploughing in the morning, again. I was coming to see you today. What was the big battle yesterday? Everyone is saying that Nangeli escaped only because of Velayudha Chekavar. It's true. It got out of hands. If Velayudha Chekavar had not come, you wouldn't be seeing me alive today. Why do you have those scars on your cheek? They are gifts from the deputy chief! What all did those barbarians do! Thank you, my Goddess, you saved her! Velayudha Chekavar really appeared like a god, didn't he? What's in this pot? Is it jaggery pudding? Today is my birthday. Father said to make some pudding. Then I thought of you, Chirukandan. So I was bringing some for you. That means you do love me! I always wonder... What? You are someone everyone is besotted with but you fell in love with me. Our marriage was decided by our parents, right? Do I need to come to the hut now? The ladies of the mansion have invited me. I said I would go. Let me go and come. Walk fast. Who is that, Janaki? Oh, no! Uncle is here! Are you feeling cold, Savithri? Your body is shivering. What happened with Savithri kutty? Um... she seems to have a high fever. She's shivering profusely. Why did you get out then? Listen, be careful with fever. Smallpox is everywhere! I also told her the same. Come, let us get going. I warned you to not go outside! Come. Oh, dear! When I saw the lord, I thought we were in trouble. You underestimated Janaki's intellect, Nangeli. Wise girl! Still, when I saw uncle, I got stressed and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, an idea came to mind and I went with it. Is Bhageerathi amma in there? Could you please come here. I have brought you some good luck. This is what we call destiny. What is it, Konthi Kurup? What is the good news? Good news indeed! Don't you understand? I am talking about Eshwaran Namboothiri, the advisor to the Maharaja. Please say it clearly, Konthi Kurup. Look over there. Put down the palanquin right here. Please step out. He was at the temple this morning when Savithri's news reached his ears. Savithri chechi... Who has come? Seems like an important person. A wrinkly old Namboothiri. He wants a sambandham, an informal marriage, with you. With me?! You know, Thanu Pillai, from Ambalapuzha to Aluva, Milord owns ten thousand yards of paddy fields. When it comes to properties, neither do I, his manager, nor he, the owner, have any idea about the vast number of houses he owns! Nothing like that will happen. Someone perfect will come to marry you. I know that for sure! What kind of man would you like to marry? A rich man or a warrior? Who do you have in mind? I want someone brave and strong like Velayudha Chekavar. You think I can find one? Not bad! Mother will be coming here soon. - Oh, no! I should get going. - How will you go? How can you cover up again and go? - There's a way! - Nangeli... Here, I kept this for you. What is this? Some drape clothes. I know you don't have enough clothes. There is also a pearl chain, a nice pair of earrings and kohl for you. Then, let me go and try these. Try the drape only at night. What if someone sees you during the day! Come, let's go from here before Mother comes. ♪ Is my dusky fellow on his way here? O ye rain cloud! ♪ ♪ Is my dusky fellow on his way here? ♪ ♪ O ye rain cloud! ♪ ♪ O ye moonlight!

[Children practising Kalaripayattu] How are the children performing? Are they building resilience? They are, gradually. That is not enough. The world should know that there are exemplary martial artists not just in the north, but also, here in the south. So do not compromise on anything. I will not. I'll take care of everything. Very well, carry on with the practice. You are home early today. Here, have some buttermilk. I heard that you don't eat properly because of your busy schedule. - Who said so? - Well, I found out. By the way, where's my son? He fell asleep. I'll bring him. No, let him sleep. Grandfather, where are you going? I thought I'll just go out for a walk. It's almost dusk now. Where will you go at this time? There are so many places to go! Am I right, dear? You are up to something! I know! Nah! Velutha, where is he off to all dressed up? Grandfather wants to go see a Kathakali performance today. Kathakali?! Where? They will be performing, 'The Slaying of Keechaka' at the Thekkumpuram temple today. Our martial arts master told me about it. The royal artist, Naanu is playing the role of Keechaka. I have been wanting to see that performance for so long! Anyway, I have decided to watch it today. Don't you know that it is forbidden for us Ezhava castes to watch Kathakali? Will the temple management allow it? But I am not going inside the temple to watch it. The north wall of the temple has fallen apart. I can sit outside and watch the performance. Can't I, dear? 200 people were beheaded and buried in Vaikom pond for organising against the ban that lower-castes cannot walk in front of temples. My father was one of them. You remember that, right, Grandfather? Look what you have done, you have upset him! No, my dear. I couldn't help feeling sad when I thought of Madhavan. But these days, the lords are not as intolerant as they were in the past. If you are so keen, you may go, Grandfather. Take someone along for help. I have already arranged all that. Kittu... Maari... bring Muthu as well, Let's go. Grandfather is delighted. He has been asking me since morning to convince you to let him go. Come... [Kathakali song] Please be seated. Please have some tender coconut water. We are all so honoured that you visited the temple today, Lord Kaimal. I was visiting a relative here. That's when I heard about today's performance. I am extremely fond of Kathakali. What are those figures gesturing with their hands? I can't understand who is saying what! You fool! They are not mere figures, but Keechakan and Panchali! This is the scene where Keechakan proposes his love to Panchali. But why stretch that out so much? I am unable to make sense of anything. I should be whipped for bringing you idiots along to watch Kathakali! - Hey! Get up! - Oh, no! Aren't you Velayudha Chekavar's father? Not his father, but his grandfather, Paavunni Perumal. Don't you know it is against the law for the lower castes to watch Kathakali? Forgive me, Milord. But we were sitting outside the wall and watching it. Forgive us if we have wronged. We will leave immediately. How can we just let you go? Shouldn't you be punished for watching it for so long? He should be thrashed to death. Velayudhan and him are openly challenging the villagers! Seems like we are in trouble. Velayudhan had warned me not to go! Just look at him! All dressed up like a king! He's even wearing a turban! He deserves two tight slaps! Oh, no! Please don't, Milord! - He is an aged man. - Did you see that?! This lowbred has touched my hand and defiled them! - Oh, Mother! - Maari... Take off your clothes! You think you are the royal state secretary? Take off the turban! Come on, fast! Did you steal all this from the palace? No, Milord. Velayudhan got them for me from abroad. I did not steal it. Look at his arrogance! Oh, no! Don't do anything. Please don't kill him, Milord! Please don't kill him! Please stop! Please, we'll go from here! Please, don't! - No! Please! - Stop! Who wants to kill my grandfather? Come forward if you are brave enough! Stop the show and come here, everyone! He has brought shame upon the land. What's going on there? Come quickly! Make way. Move. Step back, everyone! What's the matter, Velayudhan? Out with your heedless games again, are you? His games won't work out here in Thekkumpuram. You should only enter places you are allowed to. Or you will have to accept the punishment. - Do you understand, Velayudhan? - Yes, I do. But what if we entered where we are allowed? What insolence is this! Not insolence, Milord. What if my grandfather entered the property that was owned by him? This entire land beyond the temple wall belongs to us. If we go by the law, I decide what to do on the land that I pay the tax for. I was talking about the law whereby the lower caste people should not watch or learn kathakali. Even the animals that sit on this wall are allowed to watch the show. But alas! Some humans can't! Well, let me ask the custodian family of the temple. Lord Appu Kurup, why have you not rebuilt this broken wall? We need a lot of money for that. The temple hardly receives any benefactions. The situation is pitiful. Then, shall I demolish this and build a new wall? I will also donate enough money to build a nice flagstaff for the temple. If you can do that, you'll be blessed, Velayudhan. Appu Kurup! What are you saying?! We need a lot of money to build this temple wall. You! What I said is the truth, Milord. Well then, I'll start rebuilding the wall right away. My fellows, demolish this wall! Make sure to build a new wall tomorrow itself. You pay absolutely no respect to the landlords, do you? No, Milord. I wouldn't dare. It's because I pay a lot of respect, that I am going to rebuild this wall with my own money. Who is the lord in charge of the Kathakali performance? It's me, the royal artist, Naanu master. How much money do you get for a performance? It will be depressing if I talk about that. We hardly get 10 rupees and we are 12 people, including the percussionist. Would you be happy if I give you three hundred rupees to complete the performance? Three hundred rupees?! O Lord Krishna, is this a reward for performing before you, my God, for so many years? Chandru... - Here you go. - Lord Krishna! - I need you to do one more favour. - Mm? It would make me happy if you could perform on this platform. My grandfather could watch it from closer. Panikkar... Everyone get up on this platform. Let's start the performance. Hey, you! Master! You are not going to perform here today! Naanu Master will perform Kathakali. Here, today! And it's my word! Shut up, you dog! Don't beg for embarrassment in front of these people. If you don't want to get roughed up, it is best you walk away! I am letting you go only because we are in the vicinity of the temple! Look over there. Huh? These are the hoofprints of his horse! Are you sure it was Kochunni? I saw him with my own eyes! I'm not going back without Kochunni again. Chief, I hear a horse galloping close by. Chief, that's definitely him! Come on! I will finish him off today! Looks like they are all dead. They were executed and hung there by someone. Oh, no! Isn't this our commander-in-chief? Lord Panikkar! Oh! Panikkar, my Lord! What happened to you? Untie me and help me down. Or I'll die! Ladies and gentlemen! The Maharaja of Travancore earnestly informs his subjects that... Kayamkulam Kochunni, the burglar who had stolen the sacred ornaments from Padmanabha Swami temple has badly assaulted Travancore's great commander-in-chief, Pachu Panikkar and his assistants during their attempt to capture the burglar and retrieve the stolen goods. His Majesty has proclaimed a reward of 200 gold coins to whoever captures the notorious fugitive, Kochunni, either alive or dead and 100 gold coins to whoever gives information about the said thief. Kaatha, cook this fish with some tamarind. My mouth waters when I think of your scrumptious fish curry. If it is so tasty... how come you don't visit me more often? My princess, Kaatha, even if it isn't that often, when I do visit you, don't I make them unforgettable! They are also coming. Make rice and curry for them too. Ah, everyone is here! What news? There is news. An announcement has shaken all of Travancore. What announcement? Two hundred gold coins will be rewarded to anyone who captures Kayamkulam Kochunni, alive or dead. O my Goddess, what if they capture you?! No chance! Even their forefathers couldn't if they wanted to! But do these infidels know that I do not have this thing they accuse me of stealing? That's right. They must be searching for the sacred ornaments elsewhere when they should actually be looking for it in the palace grounds! Alas! I made a mistake that day! He came this way! But where is he? What happened, Priest? - Did you see anyone run this way? - No, what happened? A thief has entered the palace grounds. Let everyone know! - Let's inform the army immediately! - Come, on! Hurry up! Priest, let us look over there. He must not have gone far. Do you think it will still be there if we go again? It will be there for sure. If someone found it, they would have announced it to the world! Kochunni, there's an opportunity to recover that chest. - That's the reason we came. - What opportunity? This Thursday is the marriage celebration of the young prince. There will be singing and dancing in the evening. Everyone will be there since it is a banquet dinner. We should retrieve the chest at that time. Great idea! When you get those ornaments please give me one or two pieces. Are you crazy? We are talking about the sacred ornaments. Gems that are worth millions! What all desires! It looks like God does come to low caste people like us. Our Chekavan went and took hold of the Goddess and brought her here. He went to Vaikathappan temple in disguise and even learned how to perform the prayer rituals. Really?! [Chanting prayers] It was indeed a propitious moment when we received the idol. On this auspicious day during the Uttarayan period. Therefore, you may perform the rituals here until the temple construction is completed. Chekavar! The army officials are coming! For the lower castes who are not allowed to worship or enter the temple, building a temple and enshrining an idol is an evident violation of law and offence punishable by death. Arattupuzha Velayudha Chekavar has committed this heinous crime. The Minister of Travancore orders the arrest of Arattupuzha Velayudha Chekavar who has continuously committed atrocious crimes of attacking the authorities and the police who tried to enforce the law. There is also an order to shoot and kill if he tries to resist arrest or escape. Their strategy is to create a conflict and somehow kill you. Beat him! I will put an end to him playing the chekavar! Thrash him! Nagan Pillai, beat him until his bones break! What is it? Are you scared? No, Chief, I'm not scared. I have slight discomfort in my hand. Move aside! You said you would maul the person who hits you! Try me, if you dare, you bloody rogue! Hit me! If you dare, hit me back now! What is this? Huh? Why is this here? Chief... that... You take them to court. I'll come in sometime. We all have great respect for you, but... No matter how hungry or thirsty you are, do not drink even a drop of water that they give you. Hope you understood what I meant. Do you know who that was? He is the son of Pappu Kurup, the ex-commander-in-chief... Kannan Kurup. People say that it was your father who killed Pappu Kurup in the riots that took place in Vaikom. I know. Krishna, my Lord... Please hear my grief. You know, I go to see Lord Padmanabha every single day. But now, I have no right to go in front of my God. This devotee will not go to Padmanabha temple until the sacred ornaments are recovered. - Krishnan Thambi... - My Queen. Come here. At your command, my Queen. Send for Arattupuzha Velayudha Chekavar and ask him to come see me. - So, did you not know, my Queen? - What? Velayudha Chekavar was handcuffed and locked up in the dungeon. Locked up in the dungeon?! Yes, as per the order of the minister. This is the beginning of an ablution. Now no one will dare to even raise a finger against the royal decrees. Although I heard that some people tried to save him. He is unable to withstand my tactics. Anyway, you got rid of him in such a way that no one would even raise a doubt. You promised to specially consider me. Nambi, I will make you the commander-in-chief, using the special powers that the King has granted me. That is enough. Where is he? Who's there? - Chief. - Where is Velayudhan? I don't know, milord. Where is the prison officer, Shambhu Nair? Shambhu Nair! Chief... Where is Velayudhan who was locked up in this prison? Velayudhan was released. Who released him? The order of the minister came through a special envoy. Stop here. I summoned you to convey an important matter to you. I don't know how to thank you for saving my life, my Queen. His Highness always says that power should never be used for revenge. I have only obeyed it. Without wasting any time, shall I tell you something? Our King is going through a complete mental breakdown. He is grief-stricken that he couldn't retrieve Lord Padmanabha's sacred ornaments. What shall I do? At your command, my Queen. Those who preach about untouchability and caste have not been able to find Kochunni. I know you can do it, Velayudhan. Do it for His Majesty. As you command. Will you be attending the function this evening? Do come. I will inform His Majesty that you are coming. Kochunni... quick! I'll handle him. I know you are a celebrated thief! But I didn't expect you to be so audacious, you dog! Aren't you the son of Pappu Kurup, the ex-commander-in-chief? Yes, I'm Pappu Kurup's son! Well, I am not surprised! Pappu Kurup was the country's most loyal military chief. His son should definitely show this courage! But let me ask you something. Do you remember the loyalists of the then king who threw your father to the low castes to be beheaded. Did those who betrayed and killed your honourable father ever bother to check in on your orphaned family? My father used to tell me about your mother's plight, how she was struggling to raise you and your little sister. I don't want to hear sermons from a thief! I am not giving any sermons! I am only telling the truth! I was the one who brought food packets for your starving family. That mainour is worth millions! I will give you half of it, Inspector sir. This is Kochunni's word. What do you think of me, huh? Don't! Trust my word for the sake of your mother and little sister! Money holds great value in front of these wicked upper class people.

Do you know Kayamkulam Kochunni? Um... Has he ever come here? How will we know, Chekavar? He is mostly in the forest. Whoever goes through the forest, he steals their money and jewels. That is his job! Oho! Is that why you stood in the bull market and declared, "Kochunni is the God who steals money from the rich and gives it to the poor". - I meant... - Tell me! I said, tell me! Forgive me, Chekavar. I said that because I was afraid for my life. When we are hungry, he gives us food. And I'm someone who is always hungry. A person who feeds one morsel to a starving person is indeed a god. But isn't it wrong to accept money and goods looted and stolen from others? Once a thief, always a thief! Isn't it? We were dying from hunger, sir. That's why we accepted what he gave us. I understand your misery. None of you will starve ever again. Look over there. These are not stolen goods. I bought it with my hard-earned money. For you! Now tell me, which hut is Kochunni in? Tell the truth! I swear on my little kids, Kochunni is not here. We swear to God. What we said is the truth, Milord... You damn trickster! I'll chop off your head. Tell me the truth, where is Kochunni? Ko... Kochunni had come here. But he left before dawn. And the woman who came with him, who is she? She is one of his mistresses, Kaatha. Where did they go? To Kaatha's hut in Karthikapalli. Chekavar, if Kochunni finds out that I told you this, he will kill me! I'll protect you. We are heading out to Karthikapalli. Make it fast! I'll join you by the time you locate Kaatha's house. Can I trust you, Chathan? Chekavar, you helped us out of our misery. We will never lie to you again! Let me know whatever you need. Kaatha! Do you have any idea what just happened here? What? It was our luck that we escaped! Chekavar and his troupe had come knowing that you and Kochunni got here yesterday. So, my dear Kaatha, no matter what happens, please don't go out of this hut! - You heard me, right? - Yes. Eh?! Are you Kaatha? - Where's Kochunni? - I don't know. Kochunni dropped me here and left. Why did he come here? Because... Kochunni said that the Nair army would come searching for me in my house. That chain is studded with gems. Did Kochunni give it to you? - Mm... - Tell me the truth. Where did Kochunni go? - Are we here? - Yes. Come, Mr. Looper. Are you sure? Yes, trust me. I don't know. Come. Hey, careful. This place seems to be haunted. A bit scary, don't you think? Don't worry, Mr Looper. It is worth the risk. You won't be able to dream of such a deal. This is Kayamkulam Kochunni, our partner. Please come. Kochunni, meet Mr Looper. He is someone who exports ivory and antiques to England and France. Shall I open? Wow! Unbelievable! Have a look, Mr Looper. Mr Kannan Kurup... This is priceless! It's incredible. If we can smuggle this out to England and sell it all, all three of us will be richer than the King of Travancore. What's this foreigner saying? If we sell this in England, the three of us will become richer than the king himself. Oh! Someone is coming here. It is Arattupuzha Velayudhan. He must have come knowing that Kochunni is here. How did that jerk reach here? Give it here! Come this way. Come with me! Apparently, Kayamkulam Kochunni will even steal God's sacred ornaments if he wants to. Is that right? Aren't you the holiest thief in this land? A god to the poor and needy! But no one knows your real face. You donate a portion of what you get by murdering, looting, and stealing to the hungry and destitute. In turn, you buy the loyalty and allegiance of those innocent souls! And using them as a cover, you continue to steal again and again! That's because I am smart! Yes, you are so smart that you put the sacred ornaments on your mistress's neck! The smartness of a petty thief! Chekavar, just because you have taken up the mantle to fight for the rights of lower caste women to wear dhotis and cover their breasts, don't you dare come at me with your rebellion! I'll thrash you to death and hang you in this jungle. All this while, I tolerated your wicked crimes because you belonged to the lower caste. Also, why I never came looking for you! But you had the audacity to steal Lord Padmanabha's sacred ornaments and I won't leave here without you! Are we leaving without the jewels? Let's save our lives first. That's right. Velayudhan Chekavar has captured Kochunni, the thief! Velayudhan Chekavar has captured Kochunni, the thief! Velayudhan Chekavar has captured Kochunni, the thief! - Chekavar... - Mm? That is Lady Savithri and her sister, Janaki. Oh, they came this far? They wouldn't have missed it for anything! She is a huge admirer of yours! Velayudhan Chekavar has captured Kochunni, the thief! O Lord Padmanabha... You have saved me! It is Velayudhan who saved us now. Panikkar, will you be replaced by Velayudhan as the new commander-in-chief? Look at that smugness on his face! The arrogance, just because he captured Kochunni! We can't just let this go! Your Majesty, those women with Velayudhan have covered their chests. It is against the existing law. Kindly command what should be done. His damn parade with those low lives! Insolent man! Your Majesty, this is a violation of law and it is right before your eyes! This should not be allowed, Your Majesty! In 1812, during the reign of Rani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, wasn't there a declaration that there was nothing wrong with these women covering their breasts? But some of you, landlords, did not accept it. Isn't that the truth? Hence, that law still continues! Anyway, what our entire army couldn't do, Velayudhan managed to do it alone! Let us not bother about anything else. But welcome him with open arms. Let Kochunni remain in chains. And summon Velayudha Chekavar here. As you command. Nambi, come with me. You go first, Kurup. I'll follow you. - Get going! - Hey! Let go of me! Velayudha Chekavar, you may come closer! To Velayudha Chekavar, who protected the pride of the royal family and saved me from the curse of Lord Padmanabha, I reward you with the honorary ornament, 'Veera Shringhala' and 1008 gold coins. Don't do it, Your Highness! This shouldn't be done. We must follow the untouchability laws. You may give the reward. But His Majesty, Himself should not defy the customs. Your Majesty, that is the rule. That's right, Your Highness. You Yourself should not break the rules, especially in front of your subjects. Hey, you, Commander-in-chief! Take that reward and keep it on the steps. Then ask him to pick it up from there. Your Majesty... I didn't do this for the gold coins. But for You, my King. Our commander-in-chief, Pachu Panikkar may take this and use it for his medical expenses. You were roughed up pretty badly by Kochunni, weren't you? Don't you dare show your arrogance here! - Panikkar! - Your Majesty... How dare you insult the person who was called to be honoured here today? Velayudha Chekavar bravely accomplished what could not be achieved by Commander-in-chief, Pachu Panikkar and his army. Therefore, I hereby honour him by conferring the title of 'Panikkar'. From this day, you are not 'Velayudha Chekavar', but 'Velayudha Panikkar.' Chekavar got the title of Panikkar! Hello, gentlemen. - Hello, good morning. - Good morning. So, tell me, what's the plan for today? - I have 15 ships like these. - Alright. Four of them are on the way to Portugal with goods. Six are on their way back from Persia after unloading. - Must be halfway. - Sounds good. Do you think the loaded pepper is ready to leave the port today? - Hopefully, by tomorrow afternoon. - Very good. If weather permits, it will reach before time. Thank you. We will be back in about... hmm... six months for the next load. So, until then... Sure. - Thank you. - Thank you so much, gentlemen. Please... - Things were very nice. - Yes. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Good day. - Good day. Let's go! What brings you two here? Nangeli will explain. It's regarding the matter I mentioned yesterday. Milady is also with us. Where? Milady... Please come. She is afraid that someone will see her. You know what would happen if anyone sees her here! You don't need to be afraid of anyone here. They are all our people. I have something to tell you. Eshwaran Namboothiri will come again with the nuptial sari tomorrow. I would rather kill myself than marry that old man. Aren't you a great warrior and saviour? Can you somehow save me? Nangeli has told me everything. I am on a crusade to end the hellish suffering of Ezhavas and all other lower castes. It is not to make my life better. There is an elite class who are not happy with my interference and are waiting for an opportunity to eliminate me. And if I am found to be meddling in the affairs of Nair women, even the King, who shows some fondness towards me will turn into my adversary. Do you understand what I am saying, Milady? Your mission is noble and great. It is for the sake of the lives of thousands of poor people. I never thought about that. You shouldn't stray away from your greater purpose for a girl like me. Apologies for the trouble. She had hoped that she would get help from you as a last resort. I think she has understood the gravity of what I said. Once you decide to become the voice of the enslaved and of the outcaste, you should remain focussed on your goal! At least smile, Savithri. If not, Mother will be upset. This is our custom. What choice do we have but follow it. It seems, even though the lord is aged, he is quite capable and smart. If I ever decide not to want something. I will never go back to that thing ever again. He's pretty stubborn like that. But today! Do you know the reason I am back here again? Uh, no. I don't. That dance performance at the wedding ceremony of the young prince. I was completely enthralled by it! Aroused by love and lust, I have been enamoured and fascinated! Do you know whose dance it was? Do you know?! Our Thathri kutty's! Not Thathri, it is Savithri. She is back from her shower. Aha! Then let's begin the ceremony. Shall we, Thanu Pillai? As you wish, Milord. Also, we have prepared a small feast for you here. You may eat it yourselves. We have brought food for lord from home. Don't you know it, Thanu Pillai? One can have any number of such sambandhams but everything and everyone else is still untouchable. You are the true embodiment of beauty. A real goddess of lust! Why do you still have your breast cloth and dhoti on? Take them off. Your eyes are cupid's arrows! Come closer to me, Savithri. Let me savour your beauty. Come... Come... Come, Savithri... We have no time to waste. Please be seated, Milord. Let me get some betel leaves and nuts for you. First, let me savour you, before I savour that! What's wrong, dear? The lord is no more. Oh! You came? You betrayed me and saved yourself. I did not betray you, Kochunni. Never in my wildest dreams did I think Velayudhan would reach there. Trust me, I never go back on my word. I believed in your loyalty which is why I didn't expose you. Or else, before they hung me, they would have hanged you for treason. I know. I'll always show that loyalty to you. Don't be afraid because we lost the sacred ornaments. I have all the money we may need. There is a 'mother tree' full of vines behind the Kali temple in Vavva forest. If you dig beneath it, towards the southern side, you will find gold coins wrapped in silk cloth. And those coins are for you, my friend, who came to my rescue. Go and take it! And in return, you should kill that Velayudhan! Nambi and Kaimal, who have taken bribes from me, refuse to save me now because they are scared of him! The great Pappu Kurup's son must help me. Someone is coming. It will be done as per our discussion. Neeli... How much for the high-quality white cotton cloth? 500. 500! And the one with the golden border? 300. - How much? - 300. 300! Look at them standing there with their chests covered. Confront them! Seems like Nangeli is reigning Cherthala like how Maveli ruled Kerala? Why do you say that, Milord? You all stand there with your chests covered, behaving all ladylike! That's why I asked. If you like looking at them so much, Milord, why don't you keep your lady beside you at all times? You can look at them whenever you feel like it! Hey, you! Enough! It was during the pursuit of that feeling when the King's adviser met his end. Apparently, even the King was shocked to hear of Eshwaran Namboothiri's death. At 91 years, he went for his 24th sambandham! So lucky, wasn't he, Karunan? Undoubtedly! Looks like she didn't like it! Neeli, I'm going home. Father is sick. Need to go home early. Nangeli, I'll also come with you. Hey, you! It's best you don't go behind that girl! The Nair army might chop off your head. Please don't call upon evil, Milord. This has weaving defects, I won't pay for this. And this as well. There is nothing wrong with this, Milord. It is just one thread defect. One thread defect?! Even half a thread defect is enough for the ladies to toss it out! Can we take this to wear it, Milord? We weave all day long and you don't even pay us any money. You should thank your stars that these elite class ladies wear the garments woven by you. This one seems fine too. We will wear them. At least we can save our dhoti's money. Once you finish weaving the cloth, you lot are not even supposed to touch them! So, we can use our hands to weave but not touch? That's right. Anyway, this cloth was discarded by the lords. Let's take them. Isn't it nice, Neeli? Yes! All we need is a necklace and earrings to complete the look! And some jasmine flowers in the hair! Hurry up, my son will be crying of hunger there. We didn't make any food at home yesterday. My Goddess! So, you didn't give your son anything to eat? There were a bunch of ripened bananas in the Aayirapadam field. When no one was looking, my mother plucked two bananas and gave my son. Neeli's husband doesn't go to work? So, you don't know anything? You don't live in this place or what? We only moved here recently from Punnamada, during the paddy harvest season. The masters captured him for not paying the fishing net tax. Then those devils hanged poor Kunjan to death in the four-way junction. My Goddess! Oh, my Goddess... You betrayed me! Look at my Kunjaappu! O Lords! You killed my husband! He deserves this punishment. Fishing net tax, ladder tax, breast tax, head tax... To all the defaulters of these taxes... let this execution be a lesson! Please don't cry, Neeli. You are the one who tells us to be strong. We are born only to suffer and cry. It's her, that witch! The one who swung the scythe and escaped. Look at her walking around like a haughty princess wearing golden bordered cloth! - Catch them! - Run! Catch them! - Come here. - Leave me! - Master... - You arrogant woman! Walk Don't beat us! Keep walking! - Walk fast! - Don't beat us! Read the order. Lower castes have no right to wear clothes that cover up their ankles. For violating this rule, these women will have their ankles branded by hot iron rods. This is the first time we are doing business with Greece. I hope everyone remembers what you need to do and the rules you should follow once you are there. It will be high tide by the time you reach the shores of Greece. The auspicious moment has arrived. Chekavar... - Chekavar... - Chekavar... Help us, Chekavar... Look at this, Chekavar... - Save us, Chekavar! - Oh God! What is this! Look at them, Chekavar! Tell me, what happened? The lords chopped off their noses for wearing nose rings. What?! Chopped off their noses?! This is outrageous! Kittu, take them inside. Let me get some medicinal herbs. Come, children. Go inside. Where did this happen? At the market. The lords and their companions beat us up when we tried to stop them. A few days ago, they chopped off a woman's breast because she covered up her chest. We can't just let this go. If you cover your chest, they will cut off your breast. If you wear long cloth, they will brand your leg, and if you wear a nose ring, they will cut off your nose. Death is better than living a life like this! They wish we would all just die! Their wish will not come true for now. We will avenge them. The Poothan dance ritual at the temple is tomorrow, right? - Yes. - Tomorrow, all our women will... cover their chests, wear a long dhoti and a nose ring and perform the Poothan dance. We will provide garments and gold nose rings to everyone. [Traditional Poothan folk song] Stop! I said, stop it! Years ago, this place was granted by the king for the lower castes to perform their Poothan dance ritual. But when there is a law where they are not even allowed to cover their chests, we cannot allow these women to wear such garments and nose rings and break the laws of the land. It is an insult to our kingdom! Hence, to avoid punishment, I suggest you all disperse immediately! Only the lower castes come here. And since none of the lords ever come this way, this shouldn't insult anyone. Masters, you may return. Let these poor people continue with their rituals. - You may begin! - Let us begin! Throw them out! Get rid of everyone! Did you think there was no one in Travancore who could tame the rutted elephant of Arattupuzha? Despite me letting go, you kept provoking me! - You! - No! I can settle the score with Panikkar by myself. I don't need anyone else! Hey, you! No, Milord! Chekavar! Grandfather! Oh, no! Velayudhan... Velayudhan... Grandfather! Don't worry about me, my son. The rituals to instate the idol in our temple must take place on the auspicious day. - Grandfather! - Oh, no! Grandfather! Father... Who was with you? Who shot me? Tell me! Your Majesty, it was Velayudhan who started the problems by breaking the law at the Poothan ritual, and then beating up Kaimal, who questioned it. He has committed a serious crime. Velayudhan stabbed our deputy chief, Padaveedan Nambi, to death. And I'm a witness to that. He would have killed me too. But... And how did you manage to escape? Did you run? Someone hiding in the forest fired at Velayudhan. Fired?! Who did that? I could not see who it was. I think he was shot in his hand. Kaimal escaped when Velayudhan chased after the man who shot him. There has been an instance when a lower caste was sentenced to death for manhandling an army officer. Velayudhan has committed an even bigger crime, Your Majesty. Kindly pass an order to scourge him to death in public, without any mercy. Shouldn't we first capture Velayudhan before we can punish him? Since you haven't been able to do that, what is the point in this fictitious trial? The troops that accompanied them scattered and ran away in fear. And another set of troops searched all over but couldn't find Velayudhan. Your Majesty! Velayudhan has appeared in person. He seeks permission to meet you. Huh? Is that necessary, my King? Should you grant an audience to a criminal who has committed such a grave crime! Kindly give the order on his punishment, my King. Shouldn't we hear what he has to say? Am I not obliged to listen to the person who has been sentenced to death? Let him in. Do I need to explain the gravity of the crime you have committed. You have killed the deputy military chief of Travancore. An offence which deserves the death penalty! Do you have anything to state? I will respectfully accept any punishment that Your Majesty may impose upon me. The deputy military chief slashed the throats of four innocent people who were performing the Poothan dance ritual. Then he stabbed my grandfather to death, right in front of my eyes. I couldn't just stand there and not do anything, my King. I was forced to kill Padaveedan Nambi. But I am happy that the man I killed was in fact a traitor. What are you saying, Velayudhan? Your Highness, I would like to present a prime witness, if you grant me the permission. After all, he is the prime witness! You may bring him in. Your Highness, this dishonourable thief is Kayamkulam Kochunni's accomplice, Bava. Inspector Kannan Kurup shot me while he was riding pillion on Bava's horse. Kannan Kurup?! Yes, Your Highness! He is now part of Kochunni's camp. Our commander-in-chief, who is strongly advocating my death sentence today, when he went to Kayamkulam forest to catch Kochunni, it was Padaveedan Nambi who leaked that information to Kochunni. I cannot believe my ears! That's right, my King. The day before the commander and the army were coming to capture Kochunni, we were tipped off by Nambi and another master. He said he was beside Your Majesty when you gave the order and asked us to find a quick route to escape. He also took... 10000 gold coins from Kochunni as a reward. Your Majesty, please don't believe a thief's words over Nambi, who is no more. But I think we can believe his words, Kaimal. Because when I called the commander-in-chief and gave the order, Padaveedan was also with me. It was this lord who came with Nambi that day. Your Majesty... Forgive me! It was a mistake. Please don't kill me. Forgive me, my King. Handcuff him and lock him in the dungeon. For having committed treason, while being a Governor, Chandru Pillai deserves nothing less than a death sentence! Oh, no, Your Majesty... Oh, my King! Please have mercy on me! Please don't kill me! Are you convinced now, Kaimal? Your Majesty, it's time to light lamps for Lord Padmanabhan. It's getting late, my King. Amidst this heated trial, we forgot about Lord Padmanabha's festival. Do not postpone the rituals for Painkuni festival. That will be a bad omen. O God, forgive me. There is nothing more important than You for this Padmanabha devotee. I'm departing for the lighting ceremony of Lord Padmanabha, who will be adorned with the sacred jewels. Tomorrow is the royal hunt ritual of the Painkuni festival. Overmorrow is the arattu procession. This trail will resume only on the day after that. Until then, lock him in the dungeon. Velayudha Panikkar, who recovered Lord Padmanabha's sacred ornaments and brought so many truths to light, cannot be held solely responsible for yesterday's incident. Therefore, Panikkar shall attend the council on the day of the trial and divulge the remaining information. The verdict shall be made after that. Those who have betrayed Travancore will certainly be send to the gallows. Did you give the order to shift Bava from there? We have shifted him to another place. Oh, it is you, Rudran. How is it going? Did you arrange everything? It didn't happen. Bava was transferred from there. What?! Where was he transferred to? I don't know, Milord. All the night guards have been replaced. It was a direct order from the Queen. You were right, my Queen. When the enemy is amongst us, anything can happen at any time. If he is eliminated, then there will be no evidence left. What will we do now? If Bava reaches the council... You have been petrified ever since the King mentioned the word 'gallows', isn't it? It will happen either tonight or tomorrow night, come what may. Rudran is the King's confidante who has the freedom to pass through any corridors of the palace. Your Majesty, sleep peacefully now. It's getting late. We need to go to the temple early in the morning. Until the traitors who cheated me are punished, I cannot sleep, Kalyani. Who is that at this odd time? Rudran, move into the darkness. It's me, Raman Thambi. You scared us! I thought you would come only tomorrow. It's almost tomorrow. Hardly two hours left until tomorrow. Night time is ideal for such visits. Velayudhan's people have left for Cherthala after Perumal's cremation. The idol installation will take place the day after tomorrow. Has everything been arranged as discussed? If you request something, consider it done! Keshu has arranged someone. Chirukandan, Velayudhan's loyal ally. Chirukandan?! You know Nangeli, Velayudhan's mistress? This idiot, Chirukandan is her prospective groom. A friend of this Chirukandan has agreed to do what it takes. His name is Kandappan. Good. Pay him how much ever he wants, but I need exact updates about Velayudhan's movements from him. I have explained everything. We will reach Cherthala Governor's house tomorrow evening itself. And will discuss the rest of the plans once we are there. We will need to take some extreme steps to murder Velayudhan. Why are you peering over your shoulders, Kandappan? I was thinking how our Chekavar put all this together despite the opposition from the lords. Not Chekavar, Panikaar! Not 'Panikaar', it's Panikkar. That's what I said. You are all blessed souls. Like how Lord Ram came to eat the 'tasted fruits' from the tribal devotee, Shabari, Lord Kailashanath has arrived to hear your prayers. O, Lord Mahadeva! Narayanan Namboothiri arranged this chief priest for us. They exiled the priest who had come to install the temporary abode. Every human being has the right to worship God. And we believe it's God's will that we help them attain this right instead of forbidding it. So there are good people among these lords too. Some important person is waiting outside to meet you, Chekavar. Did I trouble you in between the rituals? No, not at all. May I know who you are? My name is Kalyana Krishnan. We have met each other once. When you came to the East India Company Office to get permission to export cardamom. Yes, I remember. The first person who held my hand and told me that there is no untouchability. I am the brother of the current Queen, Kalyanikuttyamma. I was abroad for a long time after I left my job as the Peshkar. I returned to Ananthapuri yesterday. Now I am going to my house in Irinjalakuda. I'm extremely happy to have met you. Except, I am here to tell you something you have to be very cautious about. I got to know everything from Kalyanikutty. You are passing through some dangerous circumstances right now. The Queen asked you not to take the regular route when you travel back to Ananthapuri from the temple. Alright, Milord. God belongs to everyone, not just to one set of people. Isn't that right? I completely agree with that thought. Can you understand anything, Nangeli? Even though I don't understand anything, I know one thing now, that our people can also perform Kathakali. Can you understand anything, Veluthamma? No. If Grandfather was here, he would have explained everything. This way, Milord. Damn! I can't stand the sound of that Kathakali music. Yes, Keshavan is right. Those bloody lowlifes and their temple and Kathakali! Just chaos and lawlessness! Pull yourself together. We just backed down for the time being. A tiger takes one step back before pouncing to make its fatal attack. To save our land, he needs to be killed! He must have gotten wind of our plans. That's why he decided to commute by boat. So presumptuous! Do you see, Milord? Kandappan... You go there. - Do as you were told. - Yes, Milord. - You got enough money, didn't you? - Yes. You may go. First day of Nalacharitham! You performed it really well. There is still room for improvement. But the fact that the lower castes who have not even had a whiff of such art forms managed to learn so much is highly commendable. It was Perumal who really wished to see all this happen. Grandfather's last words were that, the idol installation should take place on the designated auspicious day. That's why I wanted to conduct all the rituals today itself. You head back home. I am leaving for Ananthapuri. - Father... - Yes, my son? Will you take me with you? I am going to see His Highness, the King. Children are not allowed there. We have cut some tender king coconuts. Shall I get you one? Sure. We have got mangoes and bananas too. You may load them on the boat. There should be enough tender coconuts and fruits for everyone. Alright. Father will be back. Come, my son. Aha! Are you drinking up all the coconut water? No, I was checking if it has enough water. Nothing to check! They are first-class, tender king coconuts! Get me a good one for Chekavar. Here, take this. Also, we will need around 35 tender coconuts for the people on the boat. - I'll keep them ready. - Make it fast. Eat this. Bava?! Hey! Eh?! The physician's medicine is taking effect. Come on. Come on! Come fast! Ramanan, get up! Everybody get up. Kaali! Get up! This is treachery! Stop, Khadar! I will behead him! Kunju Pillai... YOU! You filthy dog! Father... Father... - What happened, my son? - Father... ♪ The sky, the overcast sky ♪ ♪ Has turned black in the reminiscence of someone ♪ ♪ The wick, the flaming wick ♪ ♪ Silently burns and withers in pain ♪ ♪ Do you see a world weeping? ♪ ♪ As death creeps in ♪ ♪ Do you see the heart aching? ♪ ♪ Did you see him walk away alone? ♪ ♪ The clouds, the storm clouds ♪ ♪ Buried the night sky Plunging it into darkness ♪ ♪ The shore, the shore on the other end ♪ ♪ Fades into the night, beyond the horizon ♪ ♪ The oracle with all its power and might ♪ ♪ Soars up like a wildly blowing wind ♪ ♪ A change, a change is coming ♪ ♪ Thousands will rise up in rebellion tomorrow ♪ Stop! It is better you obey me before you are beaten to death. You filthy girl! There is no Velayudhan to come to your rescue anymore! You killed our god! You evil people! You deceived and killed him! Kill us too! Just beat us to death! We are not here to see your bloody tears. It is only because of you that these low caste women dared to walk around covering their chests. That won't happen anymore. Are you willing to pay the breast tax and never cover your chest again as per the law? No! I will not do it even if I die! Beat her to death! You insolent brat! Don't harm my Nangeli, Lord! Please don't harm her! Don't beat my daughter! Don't harm her, please! O Lords! Let go of my daughter! Tell them to stop, Milord. Nangeli... Milord, tell them not to hurt my daughter! Milord! Please tell them to stop! Please tell them to stop, Milord! Then you tell her to pay the tax and live according to the law of the land. Nangeli, my daughter... Please don't cry, Father. This is our fate! Let them kill me. Stop, Milord! My daughter will die, don't hit her! Please don't kill her! How dare you defy a police officer?! Move aside! Tie him up! - Come here! - Let go of my father! Oh, no! O, my Mother! Let them be punished for breaking the law. Beat up both of them. Thrash them! Wretched humans! Oh, no! O God! I will die! You may kill me. But don't hit my father. Finally, she felt pain when we hit her father! Kill him! Let her witness it! Insolent creatures! Nangeli... Save me! Father... Agree to it, my dear! Or else they will kill your father. No! I agree! Don't hit my father! I accept my failure... Stop. Some people need such treatment to come to their senses. Release both of them. The minister will be here now. Let's begin the tax collection ceremony after that. Beware! Let this be a lesson to all of you. Finally, the law of our land has won. Good. Then, may the ceremony begin. Father... Let everything take place as per the customs. In the presence of the public and the representatives of the royal court, I hereby order Nangeli to admit her mistake, remove her upper cloth and offer the breast tax. Velayudha Chekavar is no more. Now, being stubborn won't help us. You go, my child. Pay off the tax. With these hands that have taken care of me since the day my mother died... please bless me, Father. Make it fast. The lords need to retire. First, remove your upper cloth. NANGELI! Nangeli... Go and serve this to your lords! I don't want to live in a land that does not respect women! Nangeli... Nangeli... Nangeli... Nangeli, my daughter... Oh, no! How could you! My daughter... Lords... Look at this! My dear... Oh my God! What will I do now... My dear... Milord, are you seeing this? O Lords, how will I bear this? Come! Let's carry our Nangeli's corpse to the palace. Let the king see it! Stop them! Burn her corpse. Raaru Pillai... Stop your bloody wailing and come here! O Lord! Leave me. Let go of me! Come here! Nangeli... What happened to my Nangeli? Oh, no! My Nangeli! Stop those rascals! - Run for your life! - Lords, run and save yourselves! Run! - Somebody stop them. - Flee for your life! "The people who betrayed and killed Arattupuzha Velayudha Panikkar, the god of the lower castes, also became the cause of Nangeli's and Chirukandan's suicide. This sparked an outrage among the lower caste people. They attacked the authorities and the lords. They destroyed shops and markets. The King issued a proclamation to prevent Travancore from becoming a riotous land." I demand the low caste people, including the Ezhava caste, to desist from violence. From this day, unjust taxes like breast and moustache taxes will be abolished in Travancore. I hereby grant the lower caste people, the right to cover their upper body. Unlike in the past, this order should not be violated under any circumstances. "But the historical truth is that even in the early 20th century, such inhumane practices continued in Travancore."
