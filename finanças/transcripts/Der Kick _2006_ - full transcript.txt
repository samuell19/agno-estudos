On the night of July 12, 2002, Marinus Schöberl, 16, was beaten by brothers Marco and Marcel Schönfeld and their friend Sebastian Fink. Finally, Marinus was killed by a stomp to the back of his head. Four months later, in November 2002, his corpse was found in a cesspit. The victim and the perpetrators knew each other. They were from Potzlow, a village 35 miles north of Berlin. Jutta Schönfeld, mother of Marco and Marcel. It all started on Tuesday. You know how it is. Newspapers, television... then suddenly it's you. Stern TV, RTL, RBB, they all wanted to know. The policeman said, "Just stonewall 'em." The neighbours barely even say hello, then they walk off. We'd sit at home at night and get these phone calls: "Murderers, murderers!" And groaning in the background. We got so scared that I called up some friends and asked: "Can we stay at your place?" "We'll call you back", they said. And they did... "Sorry, we can't. You understand, right? What about a hotel?" Well, we can't afford a hotel. Then I thought, "There's no running away." "We're not murderers." "We didn't do anything." I knew something would happen. Marco called to say they were going out. Him, Marcel and Sebastian Fink. That night, the 12th of July. I was in hospital. It was a full moon. I was having spinal fluids drained. I thought, "I have to go home." I was so restless. It was so warm. Birgit Schöberl, mother of Marinus. On July 12, Marinus went to Potzlow again. He had just watched a video, some animation film. He had his rucksack with him, full of the usual: swimming trunks, towel, fresh clothes. He said, "I'm spending the night in Potzlow. I'll be back on Sunday." "See you later." That's what he said. He blew me a kiss, like he always did. He always said where he was going. He knew I wanted to know. "I'll be back later." Or, "I'll sleep in the trailer." In summer, it's a little adventure. And when he didn't get home on Sunday, I called on Monday. "Maybe his mobile's turned off, or he forgot to charge it..." "or he forgot his PIN number." Whenever his credit ran out, he'd say so, and use someone else's. "Oh well, it's summer break, who knows where he is?" I wasn't really that worried. "He'll be all right in Potzlow. Nothing can happen to him there." But when he still hadn't returned by the weekend, I started to get uneasy. Early Monday morning I drove to Templin to report him as missing. And then nothing happened. Interrogation, Marcel Schönfeld. I've been informed that I can refuse to testify against my brother Marco. That won't be necessary. I want to tell the whole truth. Surname? - Schönfeld. - Christian name? - Marcel. - Place of birth? Prenzlau, Uckermark. Occupation? None. Trainee. Date of birth? March 30, 1985. Volunteer work? What? Education? I finished my 4th year at Gramzow comprehensive school. Cross-examination of the suspect. November 18, 2002, commencing 2:45 a.m. I am aware of the subject matter of today's interrogation. I've been informed of my rights as a suspect. I've been informed that I am accused of participating in a murder. I can testify to the following: it's true that I was present when a person met his death. Who was the person in question? It was Marinus Schöberl from Gerswalde. Did you act alone? Besides myself, my brother, Marco Schönfeld, and Sebastian Fink were involved. Please describe what took place. It was the 12th of July, 2002. That afternoon, my mate Sebastian arrived at Seehausen by train. My dad and I picked him up from the station. Then my brother Marco suggested we drive to Strehlow to visit Hans-Joachim Fiebranz. My brother had got out of jail nine days before, and the two of them knew each other from before. We bought a crate of beer, "Sternburger" brand, which was consumed by those present. About 1 hour later, the crate was empty. Then we got another. Marinus Schöberl had just arrived at Achim Fiebranz's yard. Achim Fiebranz, villager. Well, to be honest, I failed my first year three times. After eight years of school, they let me go. The brainy kids went to Warnitz. There was this nice teacher, my history teacher, who gave me a book as a leaving present. It was about the Stone Age and all that. Setting traps and stuff, bird traps and making bows... They made all sorts of things from reeds, like boats. That's what I wanted to show the kids. So we went to the mussel-bed. Know who was the cleverest? Marinus. He watched everything Nancy did, and the others copied him. Then we tied all the reeds together, and made a real Indian canoe. Made about 20 of them. They paddled around, and they didn't even sink. The kids had a ball, it was like... a fleet of canoes down there. Marinus and Nancy were two peas in a pod. They were 15 or 16. They used to visit my place a lot. When I knew they were coming, I'd shove our bed aside, toss a blanket over it, and they could do what they wanted. Then me and my Sieglinde would go to the parlor and watch TV. What can you do when you're on the dole? Nancy still hasn't gotten over Marinus. She has a new boyfriend from Berlin, but every night, she listens to the messages that Marinus had left. She saved them all on her mobile. Her brother Patrick has the next room. He always says, "Oh Dad," "can I sleep in Oliver's room? Nancy's howling her eyes out again." The walls are like paper. If those two brothers ever cross my path around here, I'll knock their heads off! If they stood here right now, I tell you that! That night, when they finished Marinus off, we were down at the old distillery chatting under the eaves. They were neighbours, see, and we were having a tipple. And then Marco turned up... with Marcel and Sebastian Fink. And then Marinus came. So we played cards, and suddenly Marco lost his temper. So I said, "We're playing cards here. Ludo." "My dog's allowed to bark, 'cos he's my baby." "But there'll be no tempers or brawling, got it?" Then I said, "Right, I'm off to watch TV, so lights out!" So we knocked back our beers. Marinus came up to me and said, "Achim, got a cigarette?" And I said, "Hey, it's my last one." Then I said, "Let's smoke it together." So we went and sat on the steps and had a few drags on the cigarette. I suppose you could say it was his "last smoke". Public Prosecutor. When one hears what kind of environment these youths grew up in... They'd sit around with an alcoholic, getting drunk under the eaves. They fought over who had which schnaps, and how much they'd had. Naturally, one asks, "Where were the parents?" "Why do they let their kids go there?" And after seeing those pitiful characters in court... Witness after witness, former pig and cattle farmers, now all unemployed, fallen victim to alcohol. And they sit there, seriously claiming that they can't remember a thing because of alcoholic impairment. They'll just say anything, either lie or stonewall. "You ain't seen nothing, so don't talk." Even though several of them were present during Marinus' ordeal... and didn't even lift a finger. They couldn't even say, "We're sorry," or, "We regret it." Nothing. The village lacks civilized standards. People don't take care of each other. Nobody made the effort to find the rucksack, the bicycle, or the phone charger that belonged to Marinus. Nobody did a thing. Matthias Muchow, friend of Marinus. I keep asking myself, "Why didn't he just leave?" They got him so tanked up, they had to carry him. I saw Marinus just before it happened. He was with the Schönfeld brothers, just before they visited Fiebranz. On his last night. Man, two minutes before, we saw each other at the chestnut tree by the club. I mean, you don't give it any thought. After Marinus disappeared, they found his rucksack with his phone charger. Somehow, I never gave up hope. I always thought I'd see him again. I really liked the lad. In a way, he was an asshole. Sure, but I'm no better. I'm an asshole sometimes, but you always come to your senses. I would've made up with Marinus too. Marinus, he was just like me. Just like me, really, we're not that different. He liked to get stoned, like me. He liked booze, just like me. He went to school like me, and got in trouble like me too. He was a kid like me, you could say. I had dreams too. Marinus comes to my window, I go over and open it, and say, "What happened to you, mate? Come in." "And take a shower, you stink!" "Have something to eat." "Eat, so you'll get big and strong again." "And if you want, we'll drive you" "back home, whenever you want." In November, there was the party at the club. And Marcel goes, "I know where Marinus is." No idea, it must've been the booze. Anyway, that's when I realized. The next day, I said to Dani, "Hey Dani..." "I don't think Marinus went away." "He was here the whole time." And he goes, "Where?" And I say, "Up at the pig pen." "Where exactly?" "By the cesspit..." "Shall we go and take a look?" So the three of us went up there. I started to dig. Marinus was wearing trousers like mine, but in green. He had them on in the grave... in the pit. And when I got to his T-shirt, I... His head was first to appear, then I dug out his arms, then his chest. Then the shovel hit something that felt elastic. It couldn't be skin. I looked... It was a shirt with bones. I never... And then I thought, "It might be him." Jutta and Jürgen Schönfeld, Marco and Marcel's parents. When we heard what they got up to in the barn... They showed up here at 11 p.m. The doorbell rings, I go to the door. Several policemen are standing there. "Where's Marcel," they ask. I say, "He's not here. I drove him to school in Buckow. What do you want?" "We can't tell you." Bang! Door shut, they're off. Marcel knew they'd pick him up. He was in Buckow, and hadn't even made his bed. He just sat on his bed and waited. When Marcel and I drove from Potzlow, we passed the barn. It's on the way to Buckow. The police were there. Everything was lit up. I wondered what was going on. Marcel was sitting next to me, we were listening to music. He was really calm. Even in the afternoon he seemed different. I asked, "Marcel, shall we head to Buckow?" "When do you want to go?" He goes: "Doesn't matter, Dad. We can go now, or later..." He was relaxed, like he used to be. - We didn't get it at first. - The pressure was gone. The pressure he had inside him. When we got to Buckow I said goodbye. "See you Friday," I said. He knew that the kids who dug out the body had gone to the police. Marcel said he didn't want to burden us with it. I couldn't have lived with it. I couldn't have reported him either. I... I can't believe it. To this very day, I can't... I didn't want to believe it. I don't know what to believe. At first I thought that Marco... But Marco said from the start, "I wasn't involved," "I didn't do anything." At first I thought I'd go mad when they picked up Marcel... When I was home alone, I heard voices. My dad's voice. He's long dead. And Marcel's voice. I'm gonna fight. I want the two of them to come back, Marco and Marcel. I'm so attached to Marcel, it's like someone taking your baby away after birth. I lost Marco long ago. He lives in a world of his own that doesn't even exist. It started when he was 13. We didn't do anything wrong. We raised our children well. The children come first, the partner comes second. They are still our children. - Of course they screwed up. - But they're still our children. We didn't send them up to the barn. The public prosecution has established that Marco and Marcel Schönfeld, and Sebastian Fink possess a primitive right-wing mindset, and the absolute will to act out this mindset through violence. That night, neither a Jew nor an asylum seeker could be found, nor anyone who fitted their idea of an enemy. So a mate had to serve as a surrogate victim, because they couldn't find a better one. In our view, the victim signed his own death sentence by saying, "I'm a Jew." Had he said, at that point, "Don't screw around," "it's me, your mate Marinus," I don't believe that the act of killing would have been carried out. This is not a reproach, simply a statement. Before he declared himself a Jew, they got fired up... a term that seems fitting here... ...over his bleached hair and hip-hop trousers. The act of killing was facilitated by the perpetrators' perception of the victim as mentally inferior. Besides asylum seekers, the list of potential victims could be extended to include the handicapped. And that applied to Marinus Schöberl. He stuttered, particularly when he was excited. Marcel was even friends with Marinus. He often came to our house. Marinus had a speech impediment, but otherwise he was a quiet boy. And I feel sorry about the boy... But his parents never looked after him. He stole stuff, all over the place. People say they can leave their sheds unlocked now. With Marinus around, everything would disappear. He took mopeds and stuff. - Marcel's "Schwalbe" moped, for example. - Now we think it was Marinus. He was the only one who knew where it was. Nobody else knew. We looked everywhere. Why did you strike Marinus Schöberl? I don't know. He didn't do anything to me that night. I reckon I hit him 'cause everyone else did. Did you have anything against Marinus Schöberl personally? No. Five months before, Marinus stole my moped. It was a present from my dad. I fixed it up myself. He admitted it to me, and that's why I hit him that night. Birgit Schöberl. My daughter brought the rucksack home two weeks later. Only the charger was inside. No swimming trunks, towel or fresh clothes. The police came round. They just looked at the rucksack, looked inside, then left it here. Since school was starting soon, I washed the bag and put Marinus' school things inside. And all those calls to the station! Why didn't anybody react when someone from Potzlow said that the ground had been freshly dug up at the barn? They didn't search. My boy is no runaway. Yes, sometimes I do blame myself. If I'd let him go to Bavaria, it wouldn't have happened. Marinus had problems at school, so I said, "If you don't start behaving, you won't go to Bavaria." "You'll stay here for the holidays." Well, he didn't behave, so I said, "Fine, now you'll stay here." I don't know. Whenever the doorbell rings, I expect his deep voice: "Mum, open up." Just as he always said. I sit at the window at night, thinking he'll turn up sometime. So I wait. I sit on the bench, waiting. I don't even go shopping, I wanna be there when he comes. November 18th. It was my birthday. Two policemen come to the door, acting somewhat uneasy. And there it was. They said that they'd found Marinus. Here in Potzlow. Father turned pale, and I had to look after him. Later they called a doctor who gave him a sedative. Then he was getting better, and they left. And we were alone. He couldn't hurt a fly. He wasn't even thin and lanky. He was big and well-built. And his being shy is no reason at all to make fun of him. Even if he was poor at school, he was good with his hands. He was like the man of the house. If something was broken... He'd planned to clear out the parlor when he got back from Potzlow. He had so many plans. The way they treated him... it even haunts me at night. I hear him calling out for help, but I can't do a thing. I always have to get up. I can never sleep after that. It's killing me. I'd like to add the following to my testimony of November 18, 2002. I failed to tell the whole truth, out of fear. After consuming the second crate of beer at Fiebranz's place, we went to Spierings' house. At approximately 12:30 a.m., we... I mean my brother Marco, Sebastian Fink, Marinus and I all arrived there. Mrs. Spiering and her partner were already asleep. Sebastian Fink struck the window, which broke as a result. The door was locked. My brother Marco forced it open with his shoulder. In the bedroom, we woke them up. Then we went down to the veranda and drank schnaps. At some point my brother started insulting Marinus. He kept asking whether... or saying that he was a Jew. Eventually Marinus said "yes", that he was a Jew. Then it really got started. My brother started to punch Marinus in the face, really hard. At least two or three times. Then he filled a plastic cup with beer and schnaps, and made Marinus drink it. But he wasn't able to. After the second attempt, he vomited on the table. Fink grabbed him and dragged him outside in front of the door. Marinus was so drunk that he just lay there. After about 30 minutes, Fink sat him in a chair on the veranda. Then he and my brother took turns punching him. Each punched him at least two or three times in the face. Sebastian Fink's last punch knocked Marinus and his chair to the ground. Fink sat him back up, and punched him in the face again. Then Marinus puked up again. Fink dragged him out the door again. He threw him on the ground. I was also outside at the time. Then Fink unzipped his flies and started to piss on Marinus, first on his chest, then on his face. Marinus was still conscious at the time, and asked Fink to stop. After Fink finished pissing, we both took Marinus and dragged him back to the veranda. Then things were quiet for a while. We finished the schnaps. Then my brother started to insult Marinus again. He kept telling him to admit he's a Jew. Mrs. Spiering said he should admit to being a Jew, then it'd be over. And Marinus kept saying, "Yes, I'm a Jew." But it didn't stop. After that, the three of us took turns punching him, and insulting him with the words, "You bum, you Jew," - "you scum, etc." - Mayor! Mayor 1. Potzlow's a normal village, with a pigeon club, a volunteer fire brigade. We were recently named most beautiful village of the year. Before unification, we had 500 residents. Now we have 600. That's something. Mayor 2. I assume that, at the time that the Schönfeld brothers... I think Marinus was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could've easily been someone else. That evening, they just wanted to bust someone up. That's how it is with today's youth. "We're gonna let it all out, and someone will have to pay." That kind of thing. Urn inhumation for Marinus Schöberl, aged 16. Born on September 4, 1985 in Wolfen, died on July 12, 2002 in Potzlow. Buried on December 4, 2002 in Gerswalde, at 1 p.m. Marinus Schöberl was stoned to death by inhuman beasts. By beasts whose enemy was love, language and life. And will likely stay that way. By beasts of death. My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Dear Schöberl Family members, dear friends of Marinus, there is no end to the questions. Why? Parents, siblings and friends ask themselves reproachingly, "Why didn't we act courageously to stop these perpetrators?" Instead, we allowed such deviant, wholly depraved, shaven-headed youths to bring their pernicious mindset into our communities. They even gained the applause of some people, even if it was the applause of uneasy silence. Why did no one notice that Marinus, on that July night, was chased through the entire village of Potzlow? Were they all asleep? Were they drunk? Or simply barbaric? Marcel Schönfeld. I had a good childhood. I was nine when we moved to Potzlow. At first, we used to build tree houses. We had some up at the cow barn, and down towards Zychow. First we just put blankets in them, but pretty soon we had a real wooden bungalow... in a big bush, with a view of the lake. In the middle of a field, we made a fire and built our bungalow. And then we made a floor out of boards, and added a couch and armchairs. I knew Potzlow from before. My grandpa, from Pinnow, drove tractors for the co-op. He gave me my first schnaps. I was 11. I couldn't walk straight. And then... later, we all started to drink, with mates. We were 12 or 13. We started off with beer, then we moved on to harder stuff like "Goldi" brandy and whiskey. After a while, I was drinking half a crate of beer and a bottle of "Goldi" each night. We'd buy it from the grocery depot. It was the only shop in Potzlow. They sold booze to under-18s. If I didn't have money, Dad had some. He always had some drink. In his bedroom. Always open. Schnaps. My brother Marco gave me my first boots when I was 12. You get more respect with boots. At first, in the 4th year, they made fun of my boots. Combat boots. The others at school wore hip-hop clothes. Always making comments like "Fucking fascist". I got sick of school. I was 15. Baggy pants! You can't even see what's what. I could always go to him with my problems. To my brother. He was a few years older. He always helped me out. And then suddenly he was gone. In jail. When Marco went to jail in 1999, it was hard for our Marcel. But he kept pretty much to himself. At the time, he was doing drugs. When he did them, he was always funny, laughing all the time. I thought, "He's not drunk. I'd be able to smell the alcohol." But his pupils were always so big. I was always so afraid that he'd be lying somewhere, and nobody'd know where. And I wouldn't even know. And I was so afraid for myself. I wouldn't wish such pain on anybody. It didn't improve. I went to the ear doctor. Tumor. I thought, "My world's falling apart, now it's all over." "I can't do anything anymore..." "You have so much ahead of you. The kids still need you..." I couldn't do anything, not even walk. Nothing. When my mum... At the beginning, when she told me about the tumor... I didn't really understand. When we visited her after the operation, she was fucked up. I was paralyzed. She couldn't even drink from a glass, only out of a bottle. Because of the operation... her mouth was crooked, and she'd be drooling. I... never went back to the hospital. I wanted to, but I just couldn't. "What if she doesn't survive?" That's what I thought. That's all. Interrogation, Marcel Schönfeld. - Are you capable of following the hearing? - Yes. I'm ready to truthfully resume my testimony. We had another smoke at the Spiering's place. Sebastian, Marco and I left the house and were heading towards the main road by bike when my brother said we should turn back to get Marinus. When we left him, he was still drunk in the veranda. My brother said that the Spierings wanted to be left alone, so we couldn't leave him there. So we turned around and rode back. Marinus was on a sofa on the veranda and had taken off his clothes. At first he didn't want to come. My brother... and Sebastian Fink hit him again, and forced him to put on his wet green trousers, T-shirt, jacket and shoes. My brother took him on his bike. Marinus sat on the crossbar, crying. On the way to Potzlow, my brother said we should head for the barn just to frighten Marinus a little. It was 2002. We were... drinking, yeah, getting drunk. I fell asleep, and then... Martin and a friend of his wrote "I love you, Mum," on my arm, with a permanent marker. I woke up... and read that. I insulted Martin's parents. And then Martin told me to fuck my mum. I went after him with scissors, and then he nailed me... with four, five punches to the face. Two teeth busted, one broken off, a broken jaw, a fractured cheekbone, concussion... Broken nose too. I couldn't even hit back. Marcel could've collapsed and bled to death on the way, that's how badly Martin beat him up. He was lucky to make it home at all. Marcel never got into fights. He never defended himself. One of our boys could just as easily have been the victim. Educator, pedagogical institution. Around the time when his "mate" gave Marcel a severe beating, he told me about his brother for the first time. I ask him, "What, you have a brother too?" He goes: "Yeah, but I don't really like to talk about it." I ask, "Why not? Is he older? Doesn't he live at home with you?" "He's older, he's in jail." "Oh," I say, "why is he in jail?" Well, I really don't want anything to do with him anymore. If it were up to me, he'd stay there. That'd be best. If he finds out that I colored my hair and took drugs... He goes over dead bodies. Heiko Gäbler, apprentice. Marcel changed really fast. He said, when his brother gets out of jail they're going to party. Then he asked me if I'd shave his head. I thought, "Maybe he's sick of his long hair." It was a hot summer. I have an adjustable hair clipper. Three, six, nine and twelve millimeters. He wanted... zero millimeters. Sunday afternoon, he shows up with a Fred Perry T-shirt and combat boots. It was a bit strange. With that wheat symbol, the Fred Perry laurel wreath. It normally has an "88" on it. 88 for "Heil Hitler". That evening, we had a bonfire down at the lake. There was this Negro girl. He said, "Hey, throw her on the fire for a nigger burning." "Niggers burn good." And I thought, "What's his problem? Why would he want to do that?" Her name was Alice. I was never very interested in her. She wasn't anything special. Marcel is a follower. He doesn't think for himself. I'd deport Alice. She's a crossbreed. Deport her. I don't want anything to do with her kind. She was born here, so there's not much you can do. And if she went back to where her dad's from, Mozambique, she'd be a foreigner too. That's shit as well. I mean... You have to take action earlier, not wait until they have kids. Or else who knows what'll happen. Turks are really bad. We have 9 million foreigners. That's harsh, eh? I'm the kind of guy... Everyone should stay where they were born. Oh yeah, she was born here. Everyone should stay where they are. It's pointless to have 'em all here at once. Send 'em all back. Expel them, deport them. No mercy. Jews too. Jews are in every country. Every country has its Jews. They're not Germans. Hey, it wasn't only Hitler's idea to kill all those Jews. It was Himmler. He organized the whole thing. Hitler didn't even know much about it. And when somebody starts it, then you can go along, right? I can think for myself. Sure, I wear my Fred Perry T-shirt with an "88" on it. There's a difference between what you wear and what you think, right? Heil Hitler. That recalls the era of the German Reich, the fact that you think German, and are proud to think German. Think German, think of the future, be there for your family. Work. Third cross-examination, Marcel Schönfeld. Starting at 13:10. Did you formerly have direct contact with the right-wing scene? What? Did you formerly have direct contact with the right-wing scene? That was three years ago. I was right-wing because my brother was. After he went to jail, I did like the others. The situation in Prenzlau had changed. A lot of former right-wingers were now into hip hop and techno. I did the same thing. What influence did your brother have on you? My brother calls himself a "national right-winger". He says he has to stand up for Germany, and that all of the bogus asylum seekers have to go. Do you share his opinion? No. Foreigners are people too, and when I go to Poland, I'm a foreigner. Mr. Schönfeld, do you do everything your brother tells you? If my brother tells me to bully or hit some guy, I won't do it. Just small favors, like getting cigarettes. Educator, pedagogical institution. To me, Marcel is a normal adolescent looking for orientation. Marcel comes to me, and I say, "Man, look at you! What happened to your long hair?" "You should let it grow again." And he goes, "It was a bet." He had a shaved head for a few days, or a week. I don't read too much into it. I don't want to create a hostile stereotype. I'm against labeling him as right-wing. He was never like that. People like Marcel, they're not interested in politics. I can't just say, "You're a Nazi." What he said to Alice, "Niggers burn better than roofing board," he doesn't believe that. He just said it. "Today I think red shoelaces are cool, tomorrow I'll wear different ones." "And the next day it'll be really cool to run around in pajama bottoms." The beating continued inside the barn. At the door, towards the cesspit, I ordered Marinus to kneel and bite into the rim of the pig trough. He did it at first. Then he looked up, and all three of us began beating him again. Where did you get the idea to make him bite into that rim? The idea just came to me spontaneously. Around half a year earlier, I had seen a film on TV. The film in question was "American History X". In it, a similar scene was shown. A Nazi takes a wounded nigger and puts him face down on the kerb. Then he jumps on the nigger's head as hard as he can. I ordered Marinus to bite into the rim again. And he did so. Then something snapped in me, and I jumped on Marinus' head with both feet. I was wearing my black combat boots, with white shoelaces, size 10. They're now standing on the stairs at home. Then it suddenly went quiet. Governor Platzeck came by a few days after they found Marinus. He said there's nothing he can do except otter his sympathy. What good is his sympathy? Do people think that we're getting support just because he came by? I could've done without the visits. People are making such a huge fuss. And then they portray you as a benefits case. The benefits office wrote to us saying now we're one person less, our flat is too big for us. We're no longer entitled to the flat. We have to look for a new one. We can't even pay for the funeral, not even the gravestone. Is a German worth less than a foreigner? Platzeck lays wreaths at the memorial for foreigners too. Why didn't he do more for our boy? Or for all the German youths who are getting killed? They don't do anything for 'em. You can't imagine what was going on here in Potzlow in the '60s. This used to be a pub... It had to close. There was another place across the street, where they showed films every Sunday. The projectionist came, and we got to watch a film... for 25 pfennigs a ticket! Yeah, we used to go there. In Seehausen, near Warnitz, there was an open-air cinema. We didn't have to pay at all. We just crept in. There was a May Day dance, harvest festival on the main square, dancing in the ballroom. - There was a big white house with a grocery shop. - Henke's. Henke still lives there. His shop's gone. - Down the street, another grocery shop. - Schlecht. No, it was Sprung! Paule Schlecht had the third restaurant, back towards the farm co-op. We still had a baker, a butcher, a barber. He always wore a white uniform. I used to think he was a doctor. I never let him cut my hair. Old Mr. Wilde. A bank moved in there later. Now it's all gone. Of the co-op's 700 workers, there are only two left. The few people left, you may as well evict them and open a nature reserve. We moved to Potzlow in 1994. It was tough. I didn't cope well. We'd been in Prenzlau, and now we were in a small village. I didn't go anywhere, not even to the shop. - I didn't meet people, I was just here on the farm. - No idea why people here are like that. They were all strangers once. Half of them were settlers who came after the war. From Poland... Pomerania too, and Eastern Prussia. I was in this village with Marco and Marcel, and we knew nobody. Marco didn't cope well at all. Marcel did, but not Marco. Marco Schönfeld. My... My mum worked as a cook. Quite often on... Saturdays and Sundays. I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandpa. I got to ride on his tractor. He was game for anything. When I... When I slept, he always said I looked like Grandma Ammi when she died. Besides that... I don't remember much from back then. Expert witness. Mr. Marco S. has a history of criminal activity. In the national crime register dated January 12, 2001, his name appears 17 times. The main areas of activity are theft, driving without a license and drunk driving. In addition, we have housebreaking, damage to property, fraud, coercion, extreme drunkenness and inflicting bodily harm. In 1999, after numerous warnings, Marco S. was sentenced to three years in prison without probation. On July 3, 2002, he was released from prison. Nine days before the Potzlow murder. Four weeks later, Mr. S. steals a car by forcibly ejecting its driver. He drives the car to Prenzlau. There, he and two accomplices encounter Neil Duwhite, an African, whom he beats severely for no apparent reason. In October 2002, the Neuruppin district court sentences him to another three years in prison. In November 2002, while in prison, he is accused of murdering Marinus Schöberl. He refuses to make a statement. Marco never lied, and that's a fact. You could always tell when he did something bad. I can say for sure that Marco was and still is, honest. We raised him to be non-violent. We don't hit back in our house. Marco didn't either... at least when he was sober. Marco is a person who hits back when he's drunk. Otherwise, he's the sweetest person. He'll say so himself. The sweetest person. Marco was on his bike... Seven or eight people confronted him and beat him up. Then they pulled a dead eel out of the lake, tied it to him, and chased him into the water. Then... he had to get undressed, tie the eel on again, squat naked in front of them, and wank off. They all whooped and yelled. If he hadn't done it... Well, he had to. That was our Marco's welcome. Welcome to Potzlow. It was 1994, and he was 14 years old. He never said anything about it. He just kept it to himself. He told me 2 years later, here in the kitchen. I said, "Marco, something's bothering you." And he goes, "Yeah, Mum, but I don't want to talk about it." And I said, "Come on." So he got drunk and told me everything. Then... he cried. I said, "Why didn't you tell us earlier? We could've reported it." I took him in my arms, but... Marco isn't the type who likes to be hugged. He lives in his own world, and he doesn't let anybody else in. My dad, he talked about it, just before he died. We were sitting here, and he told me what he went through in the war as a little boy. When the Russians came. A Russian came in and tried to take my grandpa's watch. He said he wouldn't give 'em a thing. They tried to take it by force, but he wouldn't give it up. Then they were strangled, both my grandpa and my grandma, before my father's eyes. He must've seen it all, heard the screams and all that. That was just before the end of the war. After the war, Potzlow had to be rebuilt. The house, the farming... Then, in 1960, came the expropriation. Livestock was taken from the barns. Cows, cattle... It was all turned into a co-op. We had to sign for how many horses went out. It became "people's property". It was owned by everyone. In other words, we lost everything. Except for a pig. We had a pig for slaughtering. But that was all. What can you do to stop it? The anger ran deep with my father. Sure, but he didn't let it show. Never said a thing. Not to me. Never. What happened after you jumped on Marinus Schöberl's head? My brother screamed, "Shit, we've killed someone." And he also said that we had to bury him. Towards the cesspit, there was a... shovel without a handle. Why didn't you call a doctor or the police? I was terrified of my brother and Sebastian Fink. They would've beaten me to a pulp. And I feared being punished, because I fell partly to blame. Objection. Based on Marinus' injuries and on other testimony, your testimony seems implausible. Would you like to reconsider? You're right. After I jumped on Marinus' head, he was still conscious and he was wheezing. But my brother said we couldn't call a doctor, that we had to finish him off. Were all three of you in agreement? It was my brother's idea. I agreed. We often used to go to Berlin with the kids, before the Wall fell. By train. Went to the zoo, took a look around. Marco was always a big fan of the tigers and leopards. We had the money, back in the GDR. I worked mostly as a carpenter. Building attics and stuff. Working Saturdays and Sundays... Illegally, so to speak. In the GDR, nobody cared so long as you were at work on Monday. In total, I worked seven days, 64 hours per week. That lasted until '86 or '87. We could go anywhere, Daddy made good money. Weekend work was good money. With my company salary, I had 3000 GDR marks cash. We were living like kings. We took holidays in Warnitz, in the company bungalow. That's 6 miles from Potzlow. We did a lot for the kids back then. A whole lot. Their every wish was granted. Expert witness. School and career. Marco S. states he got top marks in his first three years at school. His favourite subjects were German, maths and sport. He didn't start school until he was 7. He doesn't know why. He attended a school for speech improvement, even though he never had a real speech impediment. He sometimes fought with students, and was reprimanded. He then entered the 1st class in a comprehensive school. In a class of over 20 students, he failed the first year. After the 2nd and 3rd class, he dropped out of school. Sandra Birke, Marco's girlfriend. It's time to rebel, time to stand up. For I can't keep watching the troubles in my country. So stand up, you German people! You've endured much painful suffering. It's your homeland, your country, your death. Germany needs you in its hour of distress. Marco sat in his friend's armchair, it was New Years Eve '97, in Teltow. He was already legless, really merry. I thought he was a complete idiot. He just laughed, and thought it was so funny. I thought, "Who's this bloke?" So that's how it started. I thought... he was so cute. He stuttered, but as soon as you said "slow down", it was fine. When we were in a group, he was always the quietest. When I wasn't feeling good, somehow... well... he would notice it. Then he'd take me in his arms. Marco... has soft hands. Nobody could understand when suddenly he rammed his head through the glass door. Then he... he was so enraged that he thought we were the perpetrators, - the bad guys. He came up to us and... - He yelled at us. And rolled his eyes. - He smashed up everything... - ...in the veranda. He smashed the chairs with his fist, knocking off the backrests... I said, "That's not our Marco." "Before something happens, I'm going to call the police." When they came, he went with them on his own. The next day, he remembered nothing. I told Marco, with his shaved head, "Marco..." "as kids, we had to" "visit concentration camps. It was required in the GDR." "At school, we had to watch 'Naked Among Wolves'." "None of the Nazis had shaved heads," "they all had proper haircuts." "The only ones with shaved heads were the Communists" "and the Jews, who they killed." But what can you do? He remained steadfast. And as long as the big shots are pulling the strings, nothing's gonna change. More and more kids will turn right-wing. Most of them have nothing to do. Half of Potzlow is unemployed. Hardly any of the youths has a job. And nobody will need our boys either, once they get out. Not to mention me. I'm unfit for work. I worked for 30 years. I'm not getting a cent right now. Back problems. Growths on my spine. When I stand on a ladder... I can't do anything anymore. We have to pay off our debts. In the end, we have 130 euros left. My husband got a letter saying my pension's too high. 14.53 euros too much. That's why he doesn't get state benefit. It's a damn scandal. They're screwing us over! It makes you feel so humiliated. I used to be the breadwinner here. When the benefits officer called, he got really upset. That evening, he collapsed. He was lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Like a corpse. When I shook him, he came to. Then I said, "Okay, I'm calling a doctor." But it's like you're paralyzed, you can't even get to the phone. I still can't get over the fact that it's all over for me. Sandra Birke, Marco's girlfriend. Marco went to jail in 1999. Then it was my turn. There was this bird... She was in the right-wing clique, but she married a gook. I didn't get it. Then it happened. I had a blood alcohol level of 2.8. No idea what we did to her, but it got a little heated, and we broke her nose. I got three years. I got a transfer to Luckau as soon as I could. To Marco. He'd been waiting, day after day. I got a job in the kitchen, and so did he. He'd come around, pick up the food to deliver, come back with the empty containers, and I... got to take him in my arms. For 20, 25 minutes at most. The others were jealous. "You see him every day." We wanted to move in with Marco's parents, in the attic. Marco and his dad wanted to fix up the attic room. His mum always liked me. Marco really is my true love. Even after what happened in the barn, I never said that I don't love him, or that it's over. We wanted two kids. I'm 26. I wanna get started. I won't wait until I'm 40. Him too. And if he gets a job, then... then he wants to pass his driving test, and I want to pass mine too... Those are our big dreams. And then... I was still in Luckau, we had special visiting hours. He took my hand and said, "Sandra, you wanna marry me?" Just like that. "You wanna marry me?" When I was... released from jail on July 3rd, 2002, my sister called... She said, "Come to Bremen. There's work and stuff." I didn't go to Bremen. I went to Luckau... and joined Sandra... in jail. If I'd gone to Bremen, that thing in the barn wouldn't have happened. Interrogation, Marcel Schönfeld. The hearing was adjourned at 9 o'clock, and will resume at 9:40. My brother Marco and I then looked for a suitable object with which to kill Marinus. In the adjacent barn, we found a stone. It was a white concrete block, about 12 x 12 inches in size. I took the stone to the spot where Marinus lay. Using both hands, I raised the stone above my head, and struck Marinus' head as hard as I could. I did that twice. My brother felt his pulse and said he was finished. Then he said we had to bury him. He got the shovel and gave it to Fink. Fink started digging a hole by the cesspit. I helped him. When it seemed deep enough, my brother and I got Marinus. My brother took his legs, and I took his arms. Then we threw him face up into the hole. His feet were still sticking out. Fink took off Marinus' shoes, and threw them in a corn field, about 20 feet away. Where Marinus had been, there was a large pool of blood. And there was a trail of blood leading to the cesspit, which the three of us covered with gravel. When everything was covered, we rode our bikes home. In the house, we talked about what had happened and how we should act. Like if the police asked me where Marinus was, I was to say that I didn't know. Then we went to sleep. We called each other. We phoned four times a week. At the time, I didn't know what they'd done. Marco kept saying that he couldn't deal with us being separated. He kept saying that. "Sandra, I'll be coming back to jail." And I said, "Come on, it's not much longer." "I'll be moved to an open penal facility soon," "and then I'll get holiday... We're going to make it," "it's only another six months." "We're going to make it." Then he says, "I can't manage without you," "I can't make it. It's shit without you." "I'm coming back." Yeah, I... I did three years. I had so much pent-up aggression. It had to come out. It could've been anybody. I knew Marinus. If I'd had a problem with him, I could've done something before. I've said "Jew" to lots of people... and didn't kill anyone because of it. I didn't want to kill him... I didn't kill him. I just wanted to... taunt and torment him. It just came out of the situation, and then... you just do it, 'cos it's fun, and there's nothing else to do. We didn't plan anything, either. I didn't... I didn't understand why my brother made him bite into the rim, but of course I didn't try to stop it. It was a shock for me too, when Marcel... jumped down on him. I'll never forget that picture. How he looked... how he fell over onto his side. You couldn't even see a face anymore. An old suit... can be thrown away, but... children are always there, I'd say. Come what may, I'll fight this to the last. When Marcel gets out, I hope the flat is finished, complete with a bathroom. We'll tell Marco too, but... he's not interested right now, understandably, since he has quite a while to go. And then... It'll have a real kitchenette, with a nice stove, fridge, like... American style, like on TV, where the kitchen is in the room. What they call a loft. Marcel can sit up there, do his own thing... He can listen to music, and if he wants to come down, he can do. It's on hold right now, 'cos of my husband's back and my post-op dizziness, neither of us can go up there. Our... Marcel sends us money from jail... Or else we couldn't even visit him. He says, "Mum, I want to do it." He earns 220 euros. We have less, even though we've cut back just about everything. But you gotta have something to keep yourself afloat, so that... you feel life's not totally pointless. Or else... it really would be pointless if you had nobody. Who else... do you do it for? Who? Members of the court and lawyers... In the name of my family, and as Marinus' mother, I ask you to stop this game of poker. I can't watch this any more. Do you lawyers even have a conscience? Think of the indescribable torment, the fear and the pain that Marinus suffered. He's the victim, not these beasts. They'll do it again. They're ticking time bombs. Once a murderer, always a murderer. I feel hate, anger and contempt for these beasts. They don't deserve a better word. They knew exactly what they were doing, in their cold-bloodedness. Don't look for loopholes, but realize that this murder was planned and that they show no mercy or remorse. That Schönfeld family destroyed a happy family. Think of Marinus' sisters. They loved him. I know how they suffer. Our youngest daughter will need therapy for a long time. Her day in court was just like the first day. She said to me, "This must be what hell is like." And now, court members, and you three lawyers, listen carefully, and I'll tell you about our son. Marinus was a sweet, nice boy. In our family, his nickname was "Blister". He had a protective instinct toward our granddaughter Maja. He played with her, repaired her bike. And I miss him most of all. He'd smile, hug me and say, "My little mum," and give me a big hug. Those beasts deserve no mercy. They should be killed like our son was. Okay, now you know what our Marinus was like. Curse those beasts, think of justice instead. The Schöberl family. On October 24th, 2003, the day of sentencing, Birgit Schöberl died of cancer. Marcel Schönfeld was found guilty of murder, inflicting serious bodily harm and coercion, and sentenced to a juvenile sentence of eight years and six months. Marco Schönfeld was found guilty of attempted murder and inflicting serious bodily harm, and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Sebastian Fink was found guilty of inflicting bodily harm and coercion, and sentenced to a three-year juvenile prison term. Subtitles: Peter Rigney Sophie Schricker
