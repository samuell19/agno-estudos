RIDE ABOVE SAINTE-MARIE-DU-MONT, NORMANDY, JANUARY 2001 You scared me. Is Philippe with you? No, with her. Belle Intrigante? She's giving birth. I think it's coming. What's coming? The baby. Yes. Quick! The baby, quick! Easy, easy. We'll miss it. Seb, help me. Hold the tail. Hold the tail, go on. There. The vet is pregnant too, you know. Sit. We'll take care of you. Pull, pull, pull! Keep going. The amnion will tear on its own. Seb, take over for me. Go on. Are you OK, Marie? - Call an ambulance. - OK. - Now! - OK, now. Don't touch me. Hang on. Yes, hi. My wife is in labor. We're at the Des Sables Stud Farm. Could you send an ambulance, please? Yes, Des Sables Stud Farm. OK. Hang on. Stay calm. Just breathe. Don't move. Come on. Seb! Go get the towels. Go! - Here. - Thank you! OK, breathe. Come on, push. Come on. I have to push now? Push, push, push. Come on. I can see the head. Come on. Come on. You're doing great. OK, it's coming. Come on. It's a girl! Isn't she beautiful? You're OK with Zoé? Yes. Hi, Zoé. Hi! I'm your daddy. And this is your very brave mommy. This other very brave mommy is Belle Intrigante. Haddid. Yeah? Who are the two suits? The tall one is Cooper, an American. He's the new partner. The other one must be his assistant. Does he know horses? I doubt it. He looks like an accountant. More like a banker. It's gonna take a lot of cash to fix up the place. They're saying ten years of work. A banker, you think? Probably. He's sending a dozen horses from Switzerland. We're gonna be busy. You make a mess, you clean up. What? Yeah. Once we've restored this wing and rebuilt that one, we can take about 60 new horses. And as I mentioned, there's my wife's vet clinic, with the scanner and operating room. I understand, Lefèvre. You've certainly proved yourselves with her. That's Komploteur. Hopefully, the first in a long line of champions. Let's hope so, buddy. We'll have a round pen here. We'll put a dozen paddocks over there. But if we want to make champions, the most important part is this. The track. It'll start here, and go all the way to the coastline. We'll use 15 centimeters of cinder, just like at Vincennes. It'll be 1,975 meters, the largest in the area. It's a lot for one man, no? We've worked with horses for generations. I prefer to have things done right than delegate. - You know my team. - Boss. I'm working. If you're having doubts… Boss, Marie needs you right now. OK, tell her I'm coming. She told Seb: "Go get Philippe now." Go on. I'm coming. Now. Now. He's a bit special, isn't he? He's different, but he's the best with the horses. If you'll excuse me, my daughter needs me. She's a bit special too. Take your time, OK? Make yourselves at home. OK. I didn't know they were still here. So? He's fine. I'm not sure about his assistant. What's with her? He's the one I'm not sure about. What's with you? Here. I can't take it anymore. What is it, my little monster? Why are you always crying? Oh, the tears! The doctor says she's fine. It's like she's trying to drive us crazy. I love you guys, but I need a nap. There. But I'm working. It's non-negotiable. I can't take it anymore. Haddid! Come, come! - What? - Take her. - What is it? - Here. The tide is coming in. I have to train. - Wait. - Go on. Philippe! So? Will you ever quit busting our balls? So? - Two seconds slower. You gained weight. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. You replaced cigarettes with food. It's because the sand is wet. Get in. It's cold. You miss Camargue? As long as there are horses. You think I gained weight? - Yes, you gained weight. - No, I didn't. Ah, thank you. She'll love it. She loves everything I do. Here we go again. Sorry. Don't wait for me. To the stud farm, dear partner! And to your future home. In ten years, maybe? My biggest dream is to settle down in this nice trotter country… and win the Grand Prix d'Amérique. I'm sorry. If this keeps up, she's the one who will buy the farm. That's your daughter? Here. Sorry, it's not very practical. Thank you! You're brave. Between the construction, the baby, the horses… A nanny would help, no? Yes, but we don't want more victims. Thank you. - Thank you so much! - Thank you! Bye. See you soon! You OK? She's crying. And he likes horses. - He likes horses? - He likes horses. He's in finance. He likes horses, but he loves money and glamour. So you think it's a mistake? That's not what I'm saying. Then what are you saying? I'm saying… that it's a big risk and we're putting it all on the line. That's what I'm saying. We should have stayed in Camargue? We'll make it. We have to have trust. I'm here. - Go. I got this. - Thank you. Come, my little Castafiore. We're good. OK, come on. Yeah, yeah. That's what you're trying to tell me. You want to see Belle Intrigante? What do you want to do in life? Trainer or jockey? You want to be a jockey! Good! You're in the right place. You're your father's daughter. - Dad? - Yes? Is it true I was born in the stall and Komploteur is my twin? Yes. Horses don't eat meat, and they're strong. So why do we eat it? Why don't we eat hay? Good question! Come on, Komploteur! Why do horses move their ears? To hear you better. OK, go. What else do you want to know? - Why do they swish their tails? - They just do. Think Komploteur understands me? Why do you ask so many questions? APRIL 2006 …with Eureka in the lead. Eureka, number 2, leads the pack, with Eric Durivage nearby. Hold-Up a close third, followed by… Komploteur, number 3, making a comeback, 500 meters from the finish. He's catching up to his opponents. He's making his way to the front of the pack. We're nearing the stretch. Eureka still in the lead. Komploteur goes into a gallop, just as he was gaining ground. Komploteur, driven by Philippe Rodier. He will be disqualified. Eureka leads the pack, and just might take the win! And it's a win for Eureka, with… Sadly, Komploteur did not make it. We'd like to thank our partner Lamanche… It's my fault. The last turn was tight, and he got nervous. We were close. Do you think maybe we should change bits? Pulls a lot, no? But do what you want, buddy. You know what? I'll do exactly that. I'll do what I want. We'll win the next one. - We're going to see the horses! - Yep. As usual. - You girls good? - Yeah, yeah! Go wash your hands for snack time. Yeah, yeah! Look at her. Does what she wants, like her dad. You think that's funny? A little, yeah. Hi, Seb! - You coming? - Yeah. Haddid! Go on, surround me! Who wins the race? Your dad or the horse? Both. But horses don't care about trophies. What do they get? Nothing. Kisses and hay. They're coming! Watch out, Zoé! Seb! Girls, you can't sit here. You can't sit so close to the track. I told you it's dangerous. Komploteur needs to calm down too. He was scared. Seb really has a way with horses. Always has. It's a gift. Does he talk to them? In a way, but not with words. Wait! Look. With what, then? With this. That's what animals understand best. But we're animals too. Of course we are. Come. Stay here. I'll be back. - Haddid, right? - Yes. You followed Philippe from Camargue? Yes, I worked with his father. You've known him a long time. - Yes. - OK. So, I see you have… What are you doing? Philippe, hi! Did we have an appointment? Mr. Cooper wants all employees assessed. I manage my team as I see fit. - Relax. - I am relaxed. What do you know about horses? We're a team. No, we're not. - Philippe. - Yes? You're not with Zoé? She's with Seb. No, she isn't. Seb, where's Zoé? I don't know. OK, don't panic. Don't panic? She almost got hit with a sulky. You haven't seen her? She was with you. Isn't she with her friend? Madeleine left already. Not Madeleine, Belle Intrigante. You're slow sometimes. Philippe! - Go, Belle! We're gonna win! - Come see. Hurry! You have to stop her. She could fall. It's dangerous. Slowly, slowly. You scared us! How did you get up there? Come. - See how good I was? - Yeah. - Like Seb. - Like Seb, yeah. Yes, very funny. You can't do that without telling us. Give me a kiss. Prix de l'Étoile in a few minutes. SEPTEMBER, 2006 Zoé? No, wait. Come here, now. Stop. There. - Go, Komploteur! We're gonna win! - We don't say that. - What do we say? - We cross our fingers. Dad, I know you're gonna win. - We'll see. - You sure? - Yeah. - You sure? - Go on. - Get down from there. You're not there yet. He's in top form. If we make the podium, we qualify. Cooper wants nothing less. Break a leg, you two! - Break a leg! - No, not him! Up here. So, do you see them? Look! The competitors are picking up speed. Komploteur is well positioned. We're picking up speed. And we're off! Jolly Jazz off to an excellent start, along with Komploteur from Des Sables… …in third place. Hirondelle is close behind. Number 14, Komploteur, with Philippe Rodier in the pack, followed by Jericho. Eric Durivage closing in on Komploteur from the right. Philippe Rodier is blocked in. He tries to move away, but there's no space. …a shocking accident, in which Komploteur showed real character. Don't worry, sweetie. Your daddy is very strong and very brave. Luckily, the men got up and are doing fine. I'm OK. You OK? Were you hurt? How's Komploteur? Pulled flexor. Haddid is taking him in for an MRI. Slowly, slowly. We're all in shock. How are you feeling? Don't worry about me. Of course I'm worried! Stupid accident! We were doing good. Don't tell Cooper, OK? Yeah, as usual. - Sweetie! - Daddy! Come here! You gave us quite a scare! That's all it was. I'm OK. And Komploteur? Yes, he's fine. He's OK, Philippe? Five years! We'll leave you as a family. It's been a hard day. Get well soon, Philippe. Bye, Marie! Come! Come, sweetie. I was so scared, Daddy. I'm not made of glass, you know. No, I was scared for Komploteur. This one! Which one is this? Grignoun. - Him? - Paturo. Yeah. And this is… Rosso. And who's this? - Komploteur, my twin! - Yes. Think Mommy can fix him? Yes, but he won't be able to race anymore. That's horrible! He's only 6, like me. Well, life doesn't end if you can't run. We'll train more horses. It'll be fine. When I'm a jockey, I'll help. You'll have to work hard. Stop laughing, Daddy. I'm gonna be a jockey. Promise. You'll keep your promise? Why would you ask that? You promised we'd see the horses in Camargue with Grandpa. Yes, but… I had a dream about Grandpa, you know. He was talking about you. Me? What did he say? He said you had to go to bed immediately. - Daddy! - Yep. Go on, princess. Bedtime. - Let's look at photos! - No more photos. - Daddy! - Close your eyes. It's late. - Daddy… - Yes? One day, I'll beat you in a race. I'll whistle like you and go to bed when I want. Go to sleep. SUMMER 2012 Zoé, slow down! Stop! Hey, Zoé! Zoé, stop. Slow down. You know you can't make your horse gallop. You can with Komploteur because he's done racing, but not in front of Maelane. She's our champion. It teaches her bad habits. OK. Can we keep going? Zoé, stop! What did I just tell you? That Komploteur can gallop because he doesn't race. Wait. Hello? Now? Let's go, Zoé! Belle Intrigante is about to give birth! Let's go! You never stop, do you? Never! Go. I'll look after the horses. Marie and Seb are with her. Thanks, Nico. - Can you wash them, please? - Yes. Let them run after. Dad, I won, right? - We trotted the whole time. - OK. Remember to put a poultice on Maelane's front legs. We're gonna miss it! - Haddid! - Yeah? Shorten the crupper, please. Careful. - No! - Zoé! Well done, Belle Intrigante! Come, come. Well, well. Well… It's Daddy. Look, it's Daddy. You've earned the right to name her, as long as it starts with T. So, what should we call you? Good morning. What's going on? Come see. She is talented. I wish she was talented at school too. You're hard on her. I'm hard on her? She's in pajamas and barefoot. It's madness. I'm going back to bed. Get back inside. You'll catch cold. Two minutes. See how she listens to me? She listens more than you. Come on. Her name is Tempête. Like a raging tempest. I see. Your mother is raging too. You better not fall asleep at school. Go on. Go! Tempête! Come! No. Come on. Dad, please! It's the Grand Prix d'Amérique! You know how important it is to me. This isn't cool. It's because you got bad grades. Who asked you? Be nice. And if you get your grades up, you can come next time. That was the deal. Dad, please! You know how important this is. It's not up to me. - It's the Grand Prix. - I know. - What are you saying? - Nothing. - You're with me, right? - I am. OK, we're off. Can I watch the race too? You can watch, but no video games after. You go right to bed. Is that clear? I love you! It's shameful to exploit your daughter to save money on a sitter. That's funny. Seb! Keep an eye on them. - Kisses! - Have a good race! Take care of Tempête and Belle? Yeah. Belle Intrigante, Tempête! Come here, sweetie. Let's get back inside. JANUARY 2013 - Milane. - Maelane… Like "my land." The moment of truth. Welcome to the most beautiful track in the world, the Hippodrome de Paris-Vincennes… Look, it's starting! You see? Yeah, I see. Here we are, live from the Grand Prix d'Amérique in Paris! Let's make some noise! We'd like to thank Harley-Davidson, joining us in the parade. You know it's the biggest harness race in the world? Look at the crowd! It's crazy. Imagine being there. Their dresses are so ugly! Have you ever been, Seb? No, too much noise, too many clowns. There he is! Yes! Beautiful sunshine today! I see Philippe Rodier with Maelane. They're heading to the starting line! …arriving at the last moment with Melina Jocelyn. The horses. Come on, champ. We need this. The horses are getting into position. It won't be long. And it's starting. Get ready, Vincennes! And we're off! The most exciting event of the year has begun, with an excellent start by Davidson Du Pont. Maelane and Philippe Rodier… Look, he's off to a great start. He's on the inside to… Madeleine? Dammit. I'm scared. It's nothing. I'm gonna go help Seb. Don't leave me alone. Put on your headphones and turn it up. Stay here. I'll be right back, OK? OK. We're at 1:10 at the famous Vincennes track. Davidson Du Pont in the lead. In second place… Go! Belle Intrigante! Rodier picking up incredible speed with Maelane, passing his competitors. They're rounding the bend. Davidson hangs on to his lead. Rodier picking up speed 300 meters from the finish line. The four of them are neck and neck. INCOMING CALL: HOME What are they doing here? I told Monica Zoé was coming home today. They're trying to be nice. Zoé! Here, it's for you. I missed you so much. Thanks. Here you are! Look, it's for you. You like it? Yes, thank you. Want to try it? Why not? It's the latest model. With lithium batteries. You get more power and more autonomy. A real jet! You'll have a blast with it. You'll see. Can I borrow it sometimes? Can I borrow your legs? Sorry, sweetie. Crêpes and vanilla ice cream, Zoé's favorite dessert. I have a surprise for you too. I used 148 boards and 977 nails. Here we are! Hi, kiddo! It was quiet around here without you. Young people today… Welcome to your home, Zoé! Pull on the rope. It works! It was all Seb's idea. Thank you, Seb. And surprise. Belle Intrigante missed you too. She just needs some time. Yvan, enough with the ball. Zoé, I'm going to train Maelane. Want to come? Want to come? No thanks. See you later. We need help, sweetie. What are you talking about? With Zoé. We can't do it alone. We don't need anyone. Hi, Zoé! I know you'll be home soon. MESSAGE DELETED DEACTIVATE ACCOUNT CONFIRM Yeah? Hi. Do you know who I am? I'm Pierre. We'll be working together. That's what they say, anyway. So… That's better. You must be Zoé. Am I right? No, Jean-Claude. You have a sense of humor. That's good! OK, come here. Do you know what I do, why I'm here? To keep me from becoming a vegetable? Exactly. Now, this is for a tetraplegic, not a young, healthy girl like you. You're paraplegic, and only partially. So, your spinal cord injury… is incomplete. You know what that means? It means it's good news. Aren't I lucky? Yes, you are lucky. Today is the first day. So we'll take it slowly. But let's not waste too much time. So… we'll start… with your new wheelchair. Here you are, miss. Great. You know I can't feel anything. You're still going to rub my legs every day? Yes. There. Now time for a shower. I don't feel like it. Yes, but you shower every day. It's not up for debate. I'm good. You don't want help? I want to be alone. Can you help me with my Lego, please? Zoé, open up. You promised! Open up. Do you want help getting undressed, at least? But they're gonna fire canon balls! I heard you. One minute. What did you say, Zoé? I'm good. You're sure? Yvan, one minute! I'm next door if you need me. OK. I'm coming. When you see me talk to Zoé, you let me talk. I heard you. So, today's challenge is this. Yeah. You'll get onto the bed by yourself. I'm here if you fall. We're not moving until you're on that bed. Go on, Jean-Claude, you can do it! Good job. See, you just have to try. Know what? You're a lot stronger than you think. What if I don't want to? Then… you'll stay here alone… wallowing like an old lady. Can you help me off? Excuse me? I didn't get that. Please. Wait. There's something you don't understand. You're not in charge here. Stop it. Today, we're working on autonomy. But Pierre… You know the way. Autonomy! Come back! JUNE 2014 Magic Star on the outside. Maelane gaining ground, with Petrucciani close behind. He's picking up speed and heading to the front of the pack, making it to the second place. Magic Star in third, and Maelane in fourth place. It's hard to be so close to the podium. We can't always win. Yeah, but… You're going through a hard time. I'm fine. You said that last time. I'm doing everything I can. Contractually, it's my right and duty to take matters into my own hands if the results are not there. What are you saying? Truth is we've been losing too much money for too long. Things have to change. We need more horses and cash drivers to improve our chances. I know what I'm doing. It'll cost a fortune. Haddid. Did she watch the race? Still no. But she'll get there. You were close to the podium. Lefèvre called. And? And we're not 50-50 anymore. Technically, they decide. So the stud farm is theirs… and we're still here because they want us here. We shouldn't have left Camargue. I'm mad at myself. We made the decision together. Things were good there. We didn't need more. Do you ever wonder how I'm feeling? You know that not a day goes by that I don't blame myself? I go back to that night and think… if I had just let her come with us… I think about it every day. You wanted her to come. You're causing yourself pain. I'm causing myself pain. I am, a little. And our daughter is in a wheelchair. We're losing everything: the stud farm… We're up to our ears in debt. You smoke like a chimney. We don't look at each other anymore. We don't talk. We're losing everything. We're not losing everything. - We are. - No. Well… what do we have left, then? - Go on, tell me. - We have us! We have us. We'll get back on our feet. We can't give up. OK, here. He doesn't waste time. Where's Seb? The tack room. Why? I looked for you everywhere. Seb, some new people are going to come work with us. I don't want you to worry. You'll keep looking after the horses. And I need you to tell me if anyone mistreats them. That's a nice horse. It's Belle Intrigante. Can you tell? It's for Zoé? To forgive her. Forgive what? To forgive her. From here to the shoulder. There. I know you can do it. I've seen it already. Come on, both arms. Both arms. What are you doing? We're doing exercises to gain arm muscle. Can I try too? Go. You're bugging me. Are you deaf? Go! Go! It's not of my business, but… keep this up, and you'll push everyone away. What's with you? Zoé, she's mean. She's not mean. She yelled at me. You know she loves you. Get out of the sun. You'll get a sunburn. Go inside. I'll talk to her. Zoé, what did you say to your brother? You're on my case too? Don't use that tone with me. Is that clear? Leave me alone. I'm sick of you all! Zoé, get back here and apologize! Starting now, I'm staying here. You can have your life, your room and your horses back. It's me. It's for you, from your friend. Thank you. Go, Belle Intrigante! It's fine with me if you stay here all day… but you'll at least wash up a little every day. There's soap in the wash mitt, OK? You have a visitor. Come in. Hi, Zoé! It's been a while, Madeleine. I'm glad you're here. I'll leave you girls alone. See you later. Your cabin is awesome. You ignored my messages. Are you mad at me? No, I just don't want to see anyone. Here, the class wrote you a letter. Even Lucas scribbled something. And I think Momo likes you, after all. He drew little hearts. It's cute. That's a nice horse! Who made it? Your dad? No, Seb. The slow one? Nice. He's not slow. He's just different. You good? What do you mean, good? This will be a good story for you. What? That I'm a vegetable now. You'll all have a good laugh. What are you talking about? You're not here out of pity? No! It seems fine to me. Madeleine. What happened? Zoé. What are you doing? What are you doing? I wanted to drown everything out. You can't do things like that. You can't do that, sweetie. You scared me! Then you release gradually. - Slowly. - Yes, slowly. It has to be gradual, not sudden. What's wrong? Nothing. You send Pierre packing, you're mean to your brother. Your mother is worried sick. I'm losing the stud farm. Are you listening? I know you went through a tragedy. It's horrible. But you won't fix anything by making things harder. Only you can change things. We can't help. It's your responsibility. Mine is taking care of my family. I won't let you shut everyone out. What if I want to shut myself in? What will you do then? We're here for you. If that's what you want, you're on your own. OK. I thought you were stronger than this. I guess I was wrong. Come. Seb. Go on. I got it. Go on. Come on. Tempête. Too early, no. Come on. Push, push, push! Straight! Come on! Stop! Stop. Stop! No, you stop! Don't pull. You're scaring her. You're right. Starting now, you take care of her. Here. Come on. Zoé! Why are you doing this? Why? To forget. Zoé, you promised. We can't live like this. We can't live like this. It's the only time I feel good. In the water? I'll be back. Think about everything we said. Go over the motions in your head. Yes. What matters most is breadth and fluidity. And focus on properly executing your movements to the end, OK? I'm going to let go now, OK? I'm here. Ready? Excellent! Seb. What are you doing? Seb, I'm talking to you. Seb! I know you didn't mean to make me fall. It's not your fault. It's not your fault either. Focus on moving your shoulders. This is the hardest part, sweetie. You're doing great. Go, go, go. Thanks. My arms and abs are shot. You don't have much left, then. Very funny. Look. He started training Tempête. Come. You don't want to go? No. Tempête is strong. He wants to put her in the qualifiers. She'd perform better in mounted trotting. Show me. Show you what? I don't have legs, remember? So? That doesn't matter. Are you coming? She's waiting. Come. You OK? I'm OK. I think you can let go. Go, Belle Intrigante! Oh no! You OK? It's no use, I told you. I can't do it anymore. My muscles are too weak. So make them stronger. Straight ahead. Yes! Great. JULY 2014 …ahead of Oscar Del Palma, Paper Love. Little Beast in fourth, in front of Ouragan. Maelane was off to a good start, but is now in sixth. Zoé, it's working! With 150 meters to go, Petrucciani is in the lead… AUGUST 2014 Paper Love in third, ahead of Maelane. Big disappointment for Des Sables, with none of their horses in the lead. All these losses are making us look like idiots. I might have a solution. …a 6-year-old mare from Des Sables, Tempête, who had a strong showing in qualifiers. An excellent performance by Tempête and her driver, Philippe Rodier. Philippe. What? No, nothing. Sultan in third, followed by Tempête, who still hasn't made it to the podium. Here. You look beat, sweetie. JANUARY 2019 Philippe, do you know baseball? Komploteur, Maelane and now Tempête. We'll have to say goodbye to some horses and employees. I told you. I know. Unfortunately, I have no choice. It's the only way to balance our losses. I'm sorry. Well… it was a pleasure working here all these years. I'll miss you. I'm sorry. I'll miss you. An early retirement for Belle Intrigante and me isn't so bad. Our mare is no spring chicken. And I'm looking forward to getting back to Camargue. - You'll visit? - Of course. All right. Bye, Yvan! Give your sister a kiss for me. You won't forget? It's too hard for her. Komploteur, and now Belle Intrigante. Well, I'm gonna go… before we all start crying. Go on. Bye, guys! I'm sorry, Zoé. Talk to me. I ruined everything. What are you talking about? Well… my accident… and you and Dad's dream… Stop it. Look at me. I forbid you from saying that. I forbid you from thinking that. It's no one's fault, OK? And Dad? What about him? Is he gonna be OK? Is Dad gonna be OK? Yes, he's gonna be OK. We'll all be OK. Hello? Hello? It's Zoé. Do you remember me? Doesn't ring a bell. I remember a Jean-Claude. A spoiled kid with a bad attitude. What can I do for you? Seb, come! Come! Leave it. Come. Tonight, same as usual. - Yes. - We'll take Tempête instead. - Tempête? - Yeah. No bonnet, blinkers, tail strap or bell. Add 15 kilos to the saddle pad. Got it? Yeah. And bring a screwdriver. - A screwdriver? - Yep. Screwdriver, Tempête. Seb, who's there? You let a horse out? I need the track. So… wanna race? Go! Go, go, go! 1:56. How much? You, big guy, 1:59. And her? 1:56. But how? I always knew she'd be better in mounted trotting. Look. This cushions the flexion with tensors. I can tighten it how I want and I can crouch. Pierre made this? Yeah, Pierre, Mom and Seb helped. What is it? Are you mad? No. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Awesome! Careful. - Welcome! - Hi. So, where's the little powerhouse? 1:52. How long is the track? 1,975 meters, like at Vincennes. Like at Vincennes? Nice set-up. It's impressive. Yeah, thanks. It was a big investment. Philippe drew all the plans. Kind of an unorthodox mount. Oh yeah? Is the timer unorthodox too? You are? Zoé, my daughter. She's training Tempête with Seb, her lad. We'll have to change this. It's too light. - No. - Excuse me? We're not changing the bit. We don't use a crop. Sorry. OK. If I'm riding under your colors, I decide how. It's non-negotiable. Is that clear? OK. Seb, can you get a wheelchair, please? Is that clear? It's non-negotiable. I'm sorry. I didn't know. No one's gonna tell you how to drive. But Zoé and Seb take care of Tempête. It's non-negotiable. TEMPÊTE'S DRIVER ANOTHER WIN FOR KEVIN BARILLOT BARILLOT THE TACTICIAN Seb… 150. Dammit. She can't hold on much longer. What's that hotshot doing? I don't know. He's not answering. We've been ready for 15 minutes. We either do it without him or not at all. Go on, Zoé. We'll forget him for today. - Go on. - OK, I'm good. Come on. OK, Seb, start the timer! Go! What the hell is going on here? Couldn't wait five minutes? It was half an hour. Where were you? Something came up. It happens, no? And you replace me with an inva… Unbelievable. The Cornulier is in two weeks. Yeah, and have you qualified? You may not care, but if we don't win, we're done. 150. Beat you by two seconds. Who's the invalid? DECEMBER 2019 Égérie in the lead. Kevin Barillot and Tempête gaining ground in a spectacular comeback. Tempête has 100 meters to show us what she can do. Incredible! Égérie, Santiago and Tempête are neck and neck. Égérie wins the race, with Santiago in second. Tempête comes in third. The three horses qualify for the Prix de Cornulier in 15 days. Hi, beautiful! How are you? The girls are fast this year, no? Shall we? And star rider Camille Levesque qualifies with Utopie. Seb, bring her out again. Stop. There's something wrong with her front legs. They've been filed. There's a risk of a strain, right? It's possible. No, Mom, it's inevitable. Wow. Just what we needed. Yeah. Don't you have homework to do? I'll get you! I'll tell your mother! Pentefecta for today's Prix Cornulier at Vincennes. It's the only event in mounted trotting and the last major trotting event on the calendar, with the favorites competing, of course: Égérie of Banville, Tilt Fast and the mare we now know as Tempête. Despite the unfortunate weather, we're expecting the snow to turn into rain as we celebrate this major event. As you know, the Cornulier is held rain or shine. With 3 million Euros PMU for betters who select the five horses in order, this event could go down in history. Welcome to the Hippodrome de Vincennes! JANUARY 2020 Hi, beautiful! You're good. 67.2. Dammit. What is this? She's shod? What are you gonna do about it? Her frogs are shot. It's too dangerous. We do what we said, or… Or what? Or what? Or I'm out. Fine. Seb, help Zoé get ready. - What? - Go. Go on, go. What are you doing? Are you going to ride? Not like this. That's what I thought. Zoé, get ready. - Dad, we can't. - New driver. You've always wanted to be jockey. Yeah? Yes, but I can't. Of course you can. Who said we can't? Not you, that's for sure. Have you gone crazy? - This is your chance. - Yeah. - You gonna take it? - Yes. Nico, add some weight. 67 kilos, nothing less. You planned everything. You dropped out. Do you realize what you're doing? You're gonna lose your stud farm. You'll look like an idiot. I don't care. Neither do I. I'll keep racing. But it'll be over for you. Remember why you ride? Stay here till the race. Then do what you want. You're crazy. The snow is moving in. We're expecting 5 to 10 centimeters, and up to 15 centimeters in some regions. Get down. We need to focus. Later! In the last turn, watch out for 5 and 11, OK? In the final stretch, make sure she hears you. Dad, are you sure? You'll lose everything. It's the opposite, sweetie. Whatever happens, meet me past the stables after. And give it your all. OK, sweetie? I love you. OK, go. Have fun. Give this to Seb and tell him to meet me after. How is he? He's ready. I think he'll surprise us all. I think so too, dear Philippe. I hope so, as much as you do. Will you join us? No, I'll stay by the track. See you later! Yes, see you later. In just a few minutes, the Prix de Cornulier will begin. We're in for a special night. Barillot is in top shape today. He always is. But look. - I'm good. - Look, look. Please, look. We're starting in just a few moments. The competitors are making their way to the start for this amazing race, the Prix de Cornulier. The whistle has been blown… We're going for broke. Is that it? …the race is about to begin. Attention! Positions… And we're… And we're off! In second, Number 6, Tropique from Calixte. Tilt Fast close behind, accompanied by the favorite, Utopie, driven by Camille Levesque. Where is our chestnut mare? A mediocre start from Tempête and Barillot, but they are gaining ground. Come on! 400 meters into the race, Tempête picks up speed, bringing her closer to the front. In a dramatic turn of events, Tropique exits the race, and will be disqualified. And we're onto the final lap. It's the last kilometer, with… Utopie in perfect position. Tempête in third. The track is getting increasingly muddy, making things harder for some horses, Tempête especially, who seems shaken. Come on! We're getting down to the wire, with Santiago and Atlanta Express picking up speed, putting pressure on Tempête from both sides. They're closing in on Tempête, now blocked behind the horses. It's a real battle. Wow! Tempête has gone into a gallop. If her jockey doesn't get her back to a trot, she will be disqualified. Success! Back to a trot. Barillot may be a jerk, but he's good. Tempête has lost a lot of ground. It'll take a huge effort to get back to the front of the pack. We're nearing the last turn. Just 600 meters to go. Brisbane in the lead in front of Utopie, who is on the attack. Tilt Fast is still in the running. Tempête now in sixth, picking up speed. It's an unbelievable comeback. She may still have a chance to win. Camille Levesque and Utopie accelerating. Brisbane is struggling to stay in the lead. Tempête is gaining ground. Final turn. Utopie is going for it. Come on! Tempête is close behind, while… She's gonna make it. Coming round the bend, nothing is decided. Utopie is still in the lead. It's gonna take… Give it your all. Have fun. I love you. It's the moment of truth. Utopie and Camille Levesque are dominating this race. But Tempête is on the attack, with Tilt Fast close behind. Tempête picking up speed. Just 200 meters to go. What a performance from these horses! Utopie trying to stay in the lead, but Tempête isn't giving up. An epic battle between these two competitors, Levesque on Utopie and Barillot on Tempête. Who will win? 100 meters from the finish line. What an amazing fight! Will it be Utopie or Tempête and Barillot? Go! She's picking up speed! Tempête might make it! She takes the lead! Camille Levesque following on Utopie. Tempête for the win! And she wins! Tempête wins the race! Incredible! Yes! Amazing! Yes! That's the stuff! Well done, beautiful! Well done. Did you see how great she was? Amazing. Well done, sweetie! Congratulations! - I couldn't have done better. - Thank you. What do we do now? We save the stud farm? Yes. The winners are here, Kevin Barillot and Tempête. Vincennes, give them a hand! The three winners of the Prix de Cornulier! Give them a hand! They deserve it! Kevin Barillot joins us on the podium! I want to invite the owners to the stage! A pat for Tempête, also with us. Robert Cooper, owner of Tempête Des Sables! And now let's welcome our third place winner, Arnaud Duchène! And of course, Camille Levesque, joining us now! This is the first time a woman has reached the podium at the prix de Cornulier. Two women. Make some noise!
