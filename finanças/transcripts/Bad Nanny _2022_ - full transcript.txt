[dramatic, ominous music] Matilda, you promise you'll come back soon? Of course I will, sweetheart. I'm just hurrying home to get ready for my grandchildren. They're coming to see me tomorrow morning. I will be back on Monday, don't you worry. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. You be good. [soft music] - [dramatic, ominous music] - [crickets chirp] Hello? Is somebody there? Huh. [dog barking in distance] Is that you, kitty? - [dramatic, ominous music] - [crickets chirp] Hello? [rapid footsteps in grass] [screams] [soft, bright music] - Hey tony. - [tony] hey, Did you get the package? Okay, I'm opening it now. You're gonna love it, Remy. [gasps] [Remy] oh, tony, it's beautiful! Turned out great, right? And thank you for agreeing to not add "socialite". To the about the author blurb. I still think it could only help in the marketing. To leverage that aspect of your personal brand. Because you are in fact, a socialite, Remy. Your father is Marcus bell, One of the wealthiest men in Atlanta. You've been in the society pages. - Since you were a teen. - Stop, please, It's a sexist word and I don't like it. Anyway, it looks absolutely perfect. You're the best publisher ever. It's gonna be a good piece of business. I sure hope so, my charity could definitely use the funds. I still think you should take at least a little cut. Why? - That makes zero sense. - [phone rings] Oh shoot, I'm supposed to meet the next nanny candidate. Thanks again, tony. [sighs] Oh, hey, where are you off to? On my way to go interview a new nanny. - That's right, good luck. - Thanks. Oh, how'd the new book turn out? - Just perfect. - Yeah? All right, you gotta show me. I'll make sure you get a copy. Please. [soft music] [jack] sorry, Remy, I can't make it, I'm swamped. Well, we were supposed to be interviewing her together. I would've thought choosing someone to look after our child. Is something you'd want to be a part of. Of course it is something I want to be a part of, Remy. You were the one who wanted me to get involved. In the family business, remember? Uh huh. Come on, Remy, nobody knows better than you. What kind of time suck this can be. And it's all on me. Now that your father has relocated to Canada. To spearhead this new property development deal. Yeah, okay, whatever. I'll take care of it myself. [pone beeping] [soft music] - [sighs] - [soft music] Kendra Patterson, for the nanny position? - Yes, mrs. Bell-winter. - Call me Remy. You're really early. Yes, I know, the bus got me here sooner than I thought. No need to be sorry, come on in. [soft music] Would you like some iced tea or water or lemonade? No thank you. - You sure? - Yes, thank you. [Remy] let's go into the sitting room then. - Yes, mrs. Bell-winter. - Remy. Sorry. [Remy] no need to say sorry. [sighs] So as the agency probably told you, this was unexpected. We had a nanny, Matilda, who we loved, But she suddenly quit out of nowhere, No explanation. And it was my birthday yesterday... - Oh, happy birthday. - Oh, thanks. But what I was going to say is that she never reached out. Or anything and she's always made such a big deal. About our birthdays. - It's just so. - Strange. Right. Anyway, we started seeing candidates recently. I must say I was most looking forward to meeting you. Wow, I'm flattered, why? Well, it says here being a nanny was your calling. From a young age and it's all you've ever wanted to do. That's right. Why is that? My mother, she was such a nurturing woman. And I wanna be just like her to honor her memory. Her memory? She passed? Yes. I'm so sorry, Kendra. I lost my mother a little over five years ago. I still think about it every day. I know the feeling. So do you want to have kids someday? Oh no, no. I just wanna put the childcare skills. That my mother taught me to use as a nanny. I know in my heart that it's my life's work. I've worked with children in one way or the other. Since I was 13 and I can't even imagine. Wanting to do anything else. I see that. Well, I'd like to try you out. To see how you and Ella get along. She'll make the ultimate decision. - Really? - Yes, really. You and everyone else at the agency. All have similar relevant experience and of course, Each of your backgrounds have been thoroughly checked, Which is important to be sure. But with you, I sense a real genuine passion. For what you do and that counts for a lot. Thank you, I'm so pleased. Of course I would love for you to meet Ella now, But she's in ballet class, she's pretty into it. She's a really bright little girl. She's six, but she's already reading at a third grade level. - That's very impressive. - Yeah, she's an amazing kid. Not sure where she gets it from. - [laughs] - let me walk you out. Thank you. [Remy] why don't you get everything you need. For an overnight stay and we'll take it from there. [Kendra] of course. [soft music] [ominous music] [door knocks] Hey, you must be Kendra. Yes, hello. Come on in, I'm jack. [crickets chirp] Remy's upstairs giving Ella a bath, I guess they worked the kids pretty hard in ballet. Can I get you something to drink or? No, I'm fine, - Okay. - But thank you for asking. Yeah, come on, I'll show you where you're staying. [ominous music] So this is you. Wow, this is so nice. Yeah, get settled. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. [ominous music] You excited to meet Kendra? I guess. You miss Matilda? - Yeah. - Yeah, me too. I'm looking forward to seeing what you think of Kendra. Mommy likes her, but what's most important. Is to see if you like her. You ready? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. [ominous music] - [door knocks] - yes? [Remy] are you ready to meet Ella? Of course. Hello, Ella, my name is Kendra. How was ballet today? Good. [Kendra] I heard you guys had to work pretty hard. Did you learn any new moves? - Yes. - [laughs] Do you wanna show me? That was incredible. I can't believe how good you are for such a young lady. I'm not a young lady, I'm a little girl. [laughs] Of course you are. I can do more stuff too. Maybe you can show Kendra your room. And hang out before dinner. Maybe show her some of the rest of your dance moves. Okay, mommy. [soft, ominous music] [laughs] - [claps] - bravo. This is the book my mom wrote about me. You can read it if you want. Oh, thank you, Ella. And maybe I can tell you a story about my life. When I was a little girl, would you like that? Sure. [soft music] Oh, wow, it's so nice. Your mom did a great job. - [laughs] - yes, Your dress did make it into the book. - [laughs] - that's awesome. [Ella] tell her now, in case she changes her mind. - Okay. - Okay. [laughs] - Are you excited? - Yeah. Sorry to disturb you, you have a second? Of course. Well, Ella was gonna throw a fit if we didn't tell you. That we want you to officially come on as her nanny. We didn't wanna rush the decision, but she's insistent. She was worried you were gonna change your mind. [laughs] So how about it? I would love to. Great. I'll let you finish your dinner in peace. [laughs] Oh, the code to the house alarm is ella's birthday, - 10-14-18. - Thank you. - [soft, ominous music] - uh, no. No one's excused from the table. [jack] I've got work to do. And besides, I can get it from the table. Whenever I want, Remy, I'm not a child. But it's family time. [jack] I told you I have to get these emails out, tonight. [Ella] stop arguing. [Remy] it's okay, baby. - [soft, ominous music] - [crickets chirp] - [spits] - [ominous music] - [crickets chirp] - [soft, ominous music] - Hey. - Oh. I am sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I was just checking on Ella. Make yourself at home. - I'm sorry, mr. - No, no, no, no, Hey, it's okay, you can have some cake. I was just teasing, and please call me jack. No, no, that was wrong of me. Remy would be upset that I didn't ask her for permission. Remy's not like that. I shouldn't have done it. Relax. - [crickets chirp] - [soft music] Promise me you won't tell Remy. This job means the world to me, And I promise I won't do it again. - It's really not a problem. - Promise. Okay, I promise. - [laughs] - thank you jack, I owe you. You don't owe me. - [crickets chirp] - [soft music] Pretty sweet house, huh? Yes it is. It's kind of crazy. Kind of like living in a museum here. You didn't grow up like this? [laughs] No, I grew up dirt poor. Not a lot of haves in heart well. Just a few thousand have nots, Making the best of the situation. I understand that, we have a lot in common. Is that so? - [soft music] - [crickets chirp] I better got to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - [soft music] - [crickets chirp] - [soft, ominous music] - [crickets chirp] Hey, how'd the nanny interview go? It went really well, we've already hired her. Wow, that was fast. It was ella's decision, really. - So, show me the book. - Oh, yes. Wow. I got another confirmation from a donor, For the gala tonight. That's great. Oh shoot, that reminds me, I forgot to pick up my dress from the cleaners. Maybe your nanny could do it? That's not her job, but maybe she wouldn't mind. - [phone dialing] - Remy, this is amazing. They did such a great job. [phone rings] Hello mrs. Bell-winter. I mean hello Remy. How's your first day together going? Very well, we're just about to head out to the park. How lovely. Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could do me a favor. And feel free to say no, As it's not in your job description. What is it? Can you pick up my dress from harry's dry cleaning? I have to wear it for this work gala thing tonight. And I won't be able to get away from work. You can of course use my uber account I set up for you. Of course, no problem. You sure you don't mind? Don't mind at all. You're a lifesaver, thanks Kendra. You're welcome. [Ella] let's go. Yeah, let's go. Right. [soft music] Mommy's going to a fancy party tonight. Yes, I know. You should see her when she's all dressed up. She's so pretty. Is she? I want to grow up to be just like her. [dramatic music] My friends told me that she's famous. And that she gets her pictures taken a lot, - Since she was a little girl. - [dramatic music] No, don't! I'm gonna fall! Too high, too high, too high! - [dramatic music] - hi Ella, hey. [Ella] can I go play with Carly? Sure. Oh, hello, my name's lupita. Hi, Kendra. You must be the new nanny? I sure am. [lupita] I knew the last nanny, Matilda. I've heard good things about her. Yeah, no one knows what happened, She just stopped coming to work, Stopped talking to the family. That's strange. Oh, will you excuse me please? Ella, we have to go soon. Can we play for just a few more minutes? Okay, just a few. [dramatic, ominous music] Isn't this a pretty dress? It sure is. All of mommy's dresses are pretty. I wonder what it would look like on you. It would be too big. Of course it would. Wouldn't it be funny to see what that would look like? Yeah. Maybe I could try it on. Maybe you could. Hey, I have an idea, When's the last time that you went into the woods. Behind your house? I don't know. Why don't you go and pick some wildflowers for your mom? I bet there are some pretty ones back there. Okay. [soft, ominous music] [laughs] Try not to wrinkle it. I don't think this is gonna work. - [laughs] - I think you're right. It's nap time anyway. How about I tell you a story about when I was a little girl. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Kendra. - That's you. - It is. And she was the luckiest girl in the world. Why? I'll tell you why. She was the luckiest girl in the world. Because she had the best mommy in the whole world. Go away, Hailey, I can't take this anymore. They didn't have much, but they had each other. [soft music] [dramatic, ominous music] - [laughs] - [dramatic, ominous music] [crickets chirp] - Your gin and tonic. - Thank you, Kendra. You really didn't have to do that. Oh, it's my pleasure. Is it good? It's very good. Glad to hear that. Oh my god, you look absolutely amazing. You're too kind. This dress would make anyone look good. Thanks for picking it up. Oh my pleasure, would you like a drink before you go? Oh no, no, no. She has the tolerance of a two year old. Yeah, I'll save my one drink for the gala. Unless you wanna see her blackout drunk, Running out through the neighborhood. - Jack! - [laughs] Wow. Shall we go? Yes, you two go have a good time, Ella and I will hold down the fort. - Thanks, see you later. - Yeah. - [crickets chirp] - [dramatic, ominous music] [sighs] Thanks for coming tonight. Do I have a choice? Come on, jack. Sorry, it's just, you know, this kind of stuff. Isn't for me, I feel like it's all a performance. It's for a good cause. It always is. [sighs] - [soft, light music] - [people chatter] - I believe you know my wife. - Hi. You know, Remy, it really is quite an impressive turnout. And such a lovely space, thank you for having us. Please, it's I, who should be thanking you both. Remy, what's wrong? - Are you okay? - What's wrong? [jack] honey, what? If you all would please excuse me. - Remy. - Do you think she'll be okay? Excuse us. - [dramatic music] - [people chatter] - Remy! - [dramatic music] - [crickets chirp] - [soft music] I just rearranged the furniture yesterday. It's quite impressive. So is there a nanny in this house? No. Do you think I should get a nanny? It depends. On what? On whether Becky wants a nanny or not. Did you have a nanny when you were little? Oh no, my mother loved me so much. That she wanted me all to herself. In fact, if she had to work nights or weekends, She would sometimes bring me with her to work, If our neighbor couldn't watch me. Why doesn't my mommy feel that way about me? I'm not sure. - [soft music] - [phone rings] - Hello? - Hi, it's jack. Hi jack. Remy's in the hospital. Oh no! Can you watch Ella tonight? Right, of course. - We'll be home tomorrow. - Okay. What's wrong? Your mommy had to go to the hospital. Why? Is she sick? She'll be fine, but she's going to stay overnight, So we'll visit her in the morning. It's going to be okay. - Promise? - Of course. [soft, ominous music] [Ella] I'm sad I can't hug you. I know, I'm sorry I can't hug you too. Does it hurt? They have me on medication, So I feel a little better now. When are you coming home? The doctor said I'll be coming home tomorrow. I don't understand how the heck you got poison ivy. On your dress. - I'm hungry. - [laughs] Give your mom an air kiss. And we'll go down to the cafeteria and get you something. - We'll be back. - All right. I don't wanna get Ella in trouble, But I think I know what happened. What do you mean? Well, I told her she could go pick some wildflowers. Out in the back and she must have gotten poison ivy. On her clothes because I found her in your room later. Playing with your dress, trying it on. And the clothes must have gotten mixed up. - Oh Ella. - I know. But when I go back home, I can go out in the woods and get rid of the poison ivy. Oh, you don't have to do that. Oh, I insist. I used to help my mother garden, I've got quite the green thumb. It's the least I can do to help. Hey. Hi, I'm David, I work with Remy. I'm Kendra. The nanny, heard good things. [Kendra] oh good. Is this a bad time? Oh, I was just leaving. I'll go meet up with jack and Ella. [dramatic music] - Hey. - You didn't have to come by. No worries. You said in your text it was poison ivy? Long story. So what's the damage? Well, the gala sort of ended before the big ask. For the childhood food insecurity program. Yeah, I figured. I guess it would be impersonal to do an email blast. Could do that. I have an idea, Why don't we have a barbecue at my house for the donors? Long as I don't have to man the grill. [laughs] Mind if I join you? - Sure. - Thanks. Wanted to give Remy some time alone with David. He's here? Yeah, they seem pretty close. I always kind of thought that. [soft, dramatic music] - How's the jell-o? - It's okay. Hospital food. Tell you what, I'll make you your favorite grilled cheese for lunch. You're the best! - [laughs] - [soft, dramatic music] - Hey baby, I'm home. - Welcome home, mommy. Oh, thank you, honey. [laughs] Listen, I wanna talk to you about what happened. What do you mean? Well, Kendra told me it was your idea to try on the dress. You shouldn't have done that. I'm not mad, - But in the future. - It wasn't my idea. Ella darling don't make it worse by lying. I'm not lying. You don't believe me because you don't love me. Of course, I love you. I love you more than anything in the whole world. I tell you that all the time. Well, why do you have a nanny for me. Instead of taking care of me yourself? I love spending time with you, Ella. I grew up with a nanny too, And I know my mommy loved me very much. Did daddy have a nanny? Well, no. What's this all about Ella? Kendra said that her mommy loved her so much. That she didn't want anyone else to take care of her. - What? - [soft, dramatic music] - [door knocks] - yes? It's me, can we talk? Of course, about what? Did you tell Ella that I don't love her? What? Of course not. Or that I don't love her enough. To take care of her myself? No. Why? Ella told me, you said your mother loved you so much. She wouldn't let a nanny take care of you. Oh, I see where the confusion is. - Confusion? - Yes. Ella asked about my mother and if I had a nanny, Which of course I didn't. Yes and? Well, Ella said, maybe you don't love her enough. To take care of her by yourself. - She said that? - Yes. And you let her believe that? No, rather than get into the fact. That my mother couldn't afford a nanny, I said that you love Ella so much. That you have somebody else to pay even more. Attention to her, That you give her even more than I ever had. And I didn't think. It was appropriate to get into the whole, You know, money thing. I see. Ella also said it was your idea to try on the dress. Well that's normal, right? Kids sometimes tell little white lies to get out of trouble. I suppose you're right. Do you want me to go with you so we can clear all this up? Oh, no, no, no, I don't wanna make a big deal of it. That's probably best. You're a good mom, Remy. I just hope my daughter thinks so. I'm sure she does. Thanks, Kendra, sorry to bother you. No problem. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. [ominous music] You don't have to come to the barbecue if you don't want. How can I not come? It's in my house. You know what I mean. You can go out with your friends or whatever, I won't be upset. Oh, I bet you wouldn't, Leave you alone with David so you too can play house. Are you kidding, really? [jack] how is it possible that the two of you. Made a decision to have this thing in our house. Without consulting me? It's a work thing and we need the donations. - For our new project. - Forget it, Remy, I've heard all of this before. It's for a great cause, yada yada, do what you want. - Jack, don't. - Goodnight. [soft music] [dramatic, ominous music] Is something wrong? You told mommy that it was my idea to try on the dress. But it was. No it wasn't. I asked you, wouldn't it be funny. To see what it would look like. And then you said maybe I could try it on. So technically it was your idea. I'm happy to lie and tell your mama, It was all my idea if you want, But then I would have to leave and I would miss you. Would you miss me? Yes. So maybe we should just forget about it. - Okay? - Okay. I love you, Ella. I love you too. [soft, ominous music] - [people chatter] - [light music] Well, ella's up in her room with her friends. That's good, thanks. [Kendra] quite the charmer. [jack] who? Remy's friend, David, that's his name, right? Yep. Well, it looks like the party was a success. Was it your idea? No, I wasn't even consulted. Really? That doesn't seem right, this is your house. No, it doesn't seem right. Well, I need to get back to the kids. - [light music] - [people chatter] Hey, jack. So mission accomplished, Made our ask and we already got commitments. From several of the donors. Well, sure appreciate you guys hosting us. I'm not hosting, David, you and Remy are. Well no, I mean, I'm just here to help Remy. Right. - Did I say something? - It's not you. - [sighs] - [light music] - Jack! - What? - What was that about? - What? The way you were talking to David, Why are you being so rude? I'm rude? Can you keep your voice down? All I do is keep my voice down. I don't have a voice in anything around here. It's all about you. Enjoy your party. - [light music] - [birds chirp] [dramatic music] [crickets chirp] [Remy] I can't believe you did that. What? Spoke up for myself? In front of everybody? Do you know how that made me look? [jack] right, so I screwed up, again. Do we need to go back to the counselor? Why? Talking about it doesn't do anything. It didn't last time. Look, can we just, can we not do this? I have to get some sleep, I leave for Charlotte tomorrow. With David? [Remy] yes, picking him up at nine. - It's a business trip. - Right. I'll leave you alone so you can get some sleep. Jack, please. [soft, dramatic music] [sighs] I was wondering if we could talk before you left. Sure. Jack, I want you to know I heard what you said last night. And if you want me to tell David not to go. It's not about that. It's about my day to day existence in this house. I feel like everything revolves around you. And I'm just along for the ride. Between you and your dad, I'm just another employee. You asked. How could you feel that way? I love you jack, and dad thinks the world of you. He trusted you with this business. While he's out of the country. Let's just drop it. Jack! [soft music] Look, let's just talk this out when I get back, okay? - Whatever you want. - Good morning. I'm sorry, I can go back upstairs. No, no, you don't have to do that. Everything here is fine, right, honey? Just fine. I'll see you later. I might be a little late, I have to wine and dine some developers, lucky me. No worries. [soft, ominous music] Well, I'm gonna go say goodbye to Ella. Why don't you set up a puzzle in the library. And I'll see you guys tomorrow. When I get back from Charlotte. Sure, I've got everything under control. [Remy] good. - [soft, dramatic music] - [crickets chirp] - [door creaks open] - [soft, ominous music] - [sighs] - [soft, ominous music] - [sighs] - [soft, ominous music] - [laughs] - [crickets chirp] [soft, ominous music] I woke up from a bad dream, I thought I heard something. It was just me. How was your business dinner? It was fine, - [laughs] - I guess, who cares? - Is everything okay? - [soft, ominous music] - Not really. - [soft, ominous music] - I shouldn't drink anymore. - [soft, ominous music] I won't tell, besides I think you deserve it. [soft, ominous music] - Want one? - Oh no I couldn't. I won't tell. Gin and tonic? - Coming right up. - [soft, dramatic music] - [laughs] - [soft, dramatic music] - Gin and tonic. - [crickets chirp] Shall we toast? To what? To getting what we deserve in life. - I'll drink to that. - [glasses clink] [laughs] Oh. My mother used to drink gin and tonics. - Yeah? - They remind me of her. [soft music] Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine, it's just my dream, it was about my mom. - I just miss her so much. - [cries] - I'm so sorry you're upset. - [cries] - [soft, ominous music] - thank you. You've always been so kind to me. Remy is a very lucky woman. I don't think that she sees it that way. - I do. - [soft music] - [dramatic music] - [breathes heavily] - Hi, daddy. - Hi, sweet baby girl. [soft, ominous music] [Ella] I love you, daddy. I love you too. Is that yummy? - Yes. - [laughs] [jack] you stay outta trouble today. [soft, ominous music] There's nothing wrong with a little bit of trouble, - Right, Ella? - [soft, ominous music] [plane engine whirs] [Remy] dad! - What a great surprise! - [laughs] - You're in town! - That's right, Remy. - That's wonderful! - Oh its just. For a couple of nights, But I couldn't stay away from you and Ella any longer. [Remy] we can't wait to see you. All right, I'll see you tonight. [Remy] love you. [children chatter] [Kendra] come on, Ella, wouldn't you like to play? Maybe you'd go on the swing? [birds chirp] I don't wanna go on the swings. Why not? I'm sad. What about? Mommy and daddy are arguing again. And how do you know that? I heard them. Well mommys and daddies are like that sometimes. You're lucky to have a mom and dad. [birds chirp] Do you want me to tell you. More about when I was a little girl? Okay. I only saw my dad once. He was a nice man and he wanted to be with me and my mommy, But someone got in the way. The only thing stopping me. From being with you and Haley is my daughter Remy. I would never want to hurt her. - If it wasn't for her. - Leave. I wanna offer you some financial support for haley's sake. I don't want your charity. I want you out and I never wanna see you again, ever! [soft, dramatic music] But it didn't matter that he left. Because I had my mom and I knew she would never leave me. And so I thought everything would be okay. And it was. Until she passed away after getting pneumonia, Which I think was really her way of dying of a broken heart. Because of what he did to us. [birds chirp] - I'm sorry your mommy died. - Me too. But I knew I would carry on her memory. By lovingly looking after other little children, So they wouldn't ever have to go through. What I went through, left alone with no one wanting me. But I knew that one day, The person who got in the way, who ruined my mother's life, Would eventually pay for it. That's karma, right? What's karma? Karma is what happens when bad people do bad things. So don't do bad things, okay? - Okay. - [birds chirp] [crickets chirp] - Hey. - Hey there. How was your trip? It was fine. I didn't really move the needle on any major funding, But it was good to know. What some other children's nonprofits are up to. You know, it's a good thing, what you do. Why thank you. I've been a little selfish lately. No, I understand where you're coming from. I'm sorry for steam rolling the barbecue. And generally being so bossy. It's okay, really. Listen, there's something I want to tell you. What's that? Do you like my dress? Yes, it's very pretty. Do you like it, daddy? Of course I do, sweetheart. Go put your shoes on. Grandpa bell will be here soon. [crickets chirp] What did you wanna tell me? Just that I want to try harder and that I love you. - Okay, me too. - [soft music] [laughs] - You both look so nice. - Thanks. - Hey Kendra! - There she is. [laughs] Can Kendra join us for dinner tonight? Sure. [doorbell chimes] - I'll get that. - Oh. [crickets chirp] - Hey, hey. - Hey jack. Good to see you, come in. Look who I found outside. - [laughs] - hello everyone! Ella, how's my little girl? Fine. Oh boy, kisses? [laughs] I've missed you. Hello, I'm Kendra. It's nice to meet you, Marcus bell. [soft, ominous music] My big girl. I'm so excited about your book. And all the work you're doing with the charity. Has anyone ever had a more accomplished daughter? - [laughs] - [soft, ominous music] [Remy] so good to see you. Excuse me, I'll be right back. - [soft music] - [crickets chirp] [Remy] come on in, let's get you settled. All right. - How was your drive, dad? - It was good. - Really? - Not bad. - [pair chatters] - [soft music] - [dramatic, ominous music] - [breathes heavily] Et you a great big dollhouse? [Marcus] how about I get you a great big dollhouse? [Ella] I already have one grandpa. Ah, she already has one. [laughs] You're with family, let yourself take the edge off. A little bit. Well, one over my limit can't hurt. - [laughs] - right? It's a special occasion. [Marcus] speaking of which, sorry I missed your birthday. [Remy] we didn't make a big deal out of it. - We had cake. - What kind? - Wedding cake. - [laughs] [Remy] that's my girl. [Marcus] you're not getting married on me, are you, Ella? [laughs] [jack] don't give her any ideas. [laughs] [Ella] I'm too young to get married. - [laughs] - [soft, ominous music] Thank you. - [laughs] - [soft, ominous music] So, Remy tells me that Ella is quite fond of you, Kendra. [Kendra] the feeling is mutual. Good. So tell me, where'd you get your child caring skills? - From my mother. - Really? [soft, ominous music] Tell me more about her. Well, she is no longer with us. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's hard for me to talk about. I'm sure it is and you don't have to. No, I want to. My mother was everything to me. She was the sweetest and bravest person I ever knew. And a lot of people took advantage of that. A lot of people hurt her and whenever I think about it, I just. - [breathes heavily] - [soft, ominous music] Well, I truly understand. She sounds like a wonderful person. I wish I could have met her, I wish I could have helped her. - I wish you could have too. - [soft, ominous music] You know what? Let's have a toast. To new beginnings, new relationships. And happier times ahead. - Here, here. - [soft, ominous music] - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - [glass clink] - [soft, dramatic music] [crickets chirp] [sighs] - [laughs] - [ominous music] You startled me. Sorry, I just wanted to say goodbye. Yes, I just tucked Ella in and jack put Remy to sleep, She had a little too much. - Yes, I noticed. - [laughs] Well, listen, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad you're here. Thank you, have a good night. - You too. - [dramatic music] Kendra, will you tell me a story? - Sure. - [soft music] I guess my putting her to bed didn't do the trick. She is really fond of you. Yeah. - Bye now. - Bye. - [soft, ominous music] - [crickets chirp] Remy! What? What happened? My phone has been blowing up all morning. Do you know what you wrote on pixapost last night? What? I don't remember going on pixapost last night. I don't remember anything. "My husband thinks I have a thing for David at work. "He's so insecure. "The truth is I do wanna cheat on him. "I fantasize about David, I wanna see him naked, - "I wonder how big his". - Jack! I don't remember, I blacked out, but I did not write that. I mean, that doesn't sound like me at all. I don't feel that way about him. Well, apparently you're drunken alter ego does. - Jack, please listen. - Look, I'm gonna go to work. I have a tough day in front of me, even worse for you. But after this, I don't even know where we are. [soft, dramatic music] - [sighs] - [soft, dramatic music] - [keyboard clicks] - [soft, dramatic music] [phone rings] Hi tony. I'd rather tell you this in person, But I guess video call's the next best thing. I know how hard you worked on the book. I deleted the post. It doesn't matter, Remy. The damage is already done. This is a children's book and the things that you said, We have no choice but to cancel the release date. Tony, that's not fair. I mean, there's no way I would've written that. Well then who wrote them? I don't know, maybe someone hacked my account or. I'm sorry, Remy, but my hands are tied. Yeah well, I'm sorry to. [soft, dramatic music] You excited ballet practice today? I suppose you heard what I did? What do you mean? Guess not. Well, we'll talk about it later. Love you, sweetheart. Your mommy seems sad. Why don't we draw her a picture today? Okay. [soft, dramatic music] [consultant] we'll have the cost analysis for you, End of day. Sounds great, - Thank you ladies. - Thank you. [soft, dramatic music] Hey, can I come in? Of course. I was going to come talk to you. Once I worked up the courage. I'm so embarrassed. Everyone's been avoiding me all day. Well, you don't need to talk about it. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure it's, you know, Kind of embarrassing for me too. Look, I'm so sorry, David. I don't know how to put this. I just got an email and after careful consideration, Apparently the board thinks all of this is a distraction. From our purpose here at the foundation. The foundation I helped create. Yes and well, they the board gave me the fun job of. - Asking you. - If I'll step down. David, there's no way I could have written that. Okay, then who wrote it? Did someone steal your phone? - I mean. - I don't think so. I mean, it was right by my bed all night. I mean, I did drink too much, but listen, I swear, that's not something - I would ever. - Look Remy, You don't need me to tell you. - David, please. - Don't make this. Any harder than it is. - I'm sorry, Remy. - [soft music] - I'm sorry. - [soft music] Hey, there you are. I like to do my laundry while ella's at ballet practice. Good idea coming home when it's just the two of us. Look, this was a mistake. What? I need to be honest with my wife. I need to tell her what we did. And I know that means. It's gonna be the end of your employment here, But I'm gonna make sure that you're gonna be taken care of. You're gonna be compensated for it. What are you talking about? I mean, you can't work here anymore. But what about our future together? What future? The future where I get what I deserve, Where we get what we deserve, you, me, Ella. Stop, stop. Kendra, please stop. Stop, what? You said you cared about me, you said you loved me. I never said that. You did, the night we slept together, You said we would be together forever. You need to go, now. - No. - Yes, get out. You are not welcome here anymore. - [soft, ominous music] - just like him. What? You lied to me, just like he lied to my mom. Who are you talking about? I'll admit, At first I thought it was just about destroying remy's life. And walking away until it became clear. That the best way to settle the score. Wasn't just to make sure she loses everything, no, no, no, It was to make sure I won everything. Everything that was hers is mine. You, Ella, all of this. What score? What has Remy ever done to you? What has she done? She's the reason I didn't have a father. She's the reason I lost my mother. She's the reason I was left with nothing. While she had it all. - How is Remy the reason? - She's my sister. Surprise and well, you know how sibling rivalry can be. You, you were the one who did the pixapost last night. While she was passed out, that was you. Pretty good, right? The dress, that was you. Guilty as charged. My god, you have put her through hell. Just like she did to me. This conversation is over, I am telling Remy everything. I'll tell Remy and the police. That you forced yourself onto me. Are you threatening me? 'Cause if you are, you'll be in more trouble. Than you are right now. No, I'm not listening to this, I'm gonna... What? What are you gonna do? Call the police, huh? Accuse me, after you just told me everything, That you're remy's sister, That this is some warped revenge fantasy. It's not a fantasy! - [dramatic ominous music] - ah! - [car honks] - [dramatic, ominous music] - [cries] - [dramatic ominous music] Jack, jack! Oh my god! Oh my god, jack! Oh my god! - Oh my god! - [cries] [whimpers] Kendra? [whimpers] Wait! Oh god, oh my god. Okay, okay, wait, wait. - [whimpers] - [soft, dramatic music] Yes, I have an emergency. My husband has fallen, he's hurt bad. We need an ambulance, please hurry. - [sirens sound] - the broken leg and wrist. Will be fine but the ct scan shows. That he did experience some brain trauma. [Remy] how long will he be in a coma? It's hard to say, it could be a day or weeks or longer. We'll know more in the next 24 hours. Thank you, doctor. Mrs. Bell-winter, I need a word please. I just got ms. Patterson's official statement. She's made some serious allegations. Against your husband. What exactly? That he attempted to sexually assault her. And that she got away up the stairs. He followed, grabbed her by the head. And smashed it against the railing. She broke free, pushed him away in self defense. And he fell down the stairs. I don't believe it, he wouldn't do that. I understand you feel that way, But we have to take the accusation seriously. [Remy] is he under arrest? Not at this time, But we will be putting an officer outside the room. Where's Kendra? [officer] I think she's down the hall. - [dramatic music] - dr. Norris, dial 118. Dr. Norris, please dial 118. How are you feeling? I've been better, They're keeping me overnight to make sure. You're lying about jack. I'm not lying about anything. I know my husband, he would never do that. Well then you don't know your husband. Ever since you came into our lives, Everything's started to go wrong. Are you blaming me? Let's just wait until jack wakes up. There you are. - Where's Ella? - With a nurse. There's nothing more we can do here. Let's just all go home and get some sleep. I'll be back in the morning. [soft, dramatic music] [intercom] dr. Norris, You have a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Norris, a visitor in the main lobby. [soft, ominous music] [high tension music] - What? - Shut up! It's my turn to talk, daddy. Daddy? That's right, it's been a long time. Oh my god. Haley? Haley Patterson? [laughs] You remember my name? I never forgot about you. I wanted to support you and your mom, But she didn't want anything, she never. [Kendra] she's dead, died of a broken heart. Oh, Haley, I didn't know. How could you know? You never bothered to check on me. I'm sorry. You should be. Although you know who I really blame? Who? Remy. She's the reason that everything went the way it did. Oh, Haley, don't put this on Remy, it was me. Why shouldn't I put it on Remy? I heard you, you said it wasn't for her, You would be with mommy and me. Haley, the pain you must have endured. Please, please forgive me. - Okay then. - No! - Ah! - [dramatic music] [moans] I thought you were in the hospital. They let me out. And your daddy's all better. Your mommy's there at the hospital with him. Do you want me to take you there? Okay.

I watched you my whole life. The girl who had it all while I had nothing, All of my suffering was because of you. How was it because of me? - You took my father. - What are you talking about? - I'm your sister, Remy. - [gasps] - Yes. - Oh my god. Your father loved my mother. And we could have been a happy family if it wasn't for you. - [cries] - he told my mother. That it was because of you that he couldn't be with us. Do you know what my mother did? I asked you a question! Do you know what my mother did? What? What did your mother do? She gave up on life and died and left me alone, Because of you, because he chose you over us. Kendra, I had no idea, but why are you hurting Ella? What did she do? I'm hurting Ella to hurt you, is it working? Kendra, listen, what happened to you, it was wrong. And if there's anything I can do to make. Do you know what I was doing. While you were a horse jumping and going to debutante balls? What? I lived in an orphanage. - I'm so sorry. - No one wanted to adopt me. Because I was too old and they knew my story. I was damaged goods. That's truly horrible, I can't imagine how you felt. I felt alone, I had no one. My mother who was my whole world was gone. I had no one, Remy. And all the while I saw pictures of you. In the society pages. I saw the girl who had the whole world in her hands, While I lived in a world of pain, neglect and abuse. Do you know what the older boys at the orphanage. Used to do to me? - Do you? - [ominous music] - [screams] - [high tension music] - [grunts] - [high tension music] Oh, I forgot to mention I had sex with your husband, Not bad. - [grunts] - [high tension music] I guess this is goodbye, sis. - [high tension music] - [gasps] - [coughs] - [gasps] Take her, I'll check her.

I love you too, daddy. You are such a brave girl. I am? You certainly are. Mommy's brave too. - She is. - [soft music] Let's go visit grandpa bill, he's been asking about you. [soft music] So you're telling me that I flew all the way down here, Last minute from new york to beg you in person for nothing. I'm not saying that. I'm just not ready to share this nightmare with the world. Fine. I'll keep bugging you about it though. I'm sure you will. At least your children's book is back in business. Oh, thank goodness for that. But getting back to your ordeal, What happened to the previous nanny, Before the nanny from hell? Matilda? Kendra threatened her and her family. If she didn't disappear. Fortunately she's okay and has moved on. Unbelievable. How did the agency not flag kendra's instability? Because she was playing the long game. She worked with children for a couple of years. And genuinely had glowing recommendations. She'd been holding it all inside. Until she exploded in your life. Yes. It's strange as horrible as all of it is, and it's horrible. Truly. What I feel most is gratitude. That it's over? That I have Ella. Everything else? What happened to my dad, what jack did, All of it, that can be dealt with but my baby girl, I'm just so grateful that she's here with me. Ella. - Hi, mommy. - Time to get up. - I had a scary dream. - About Kendra? - Yes. - Yeah, me too. But she's gone now and will spend the rest of her life. In jail and never come back. And I'll be here to protect you, honey, always and forever. All right, let's get you up and ready for breakfast. [soft music] Excited to show off your new project today? - [laughs] - [soft music] - Cereal's good, huh? - Yeah, How are those marshmallows? [soft music] [ominous music]
