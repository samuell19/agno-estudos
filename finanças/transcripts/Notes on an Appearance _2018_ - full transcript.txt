A brief hello from Milan. We've had a very nice time. Madeleine is well set-up here. She told me to extend an invitation. Maybe next summer? Looking forward to New York and to seeing you. There's a lot for us to talk about, too. See you soon. David. But, if you see, then from here did you see this is Jonathan's study. Very necessary. Are those the same dimensions that are there now? Didn't even exist. We just four-walled part of the living room. Oh, right. Yeah. And that's where we're standing? Correct. This door, which will no longer be here, that is the door right there. - I know. - Remember that. It's the last time you'll see them. - Are you on a blood thinner? That's fine. Start with 20 milligrams and go up to 25 after a week. Yeah, yeah, sometimes dizziness, sometimes nausea, but usually nothing. Only once. No. 30 days. This is very safe. It's a very safe drug. No one ever gave me money. I left my parents' house early, because I remembered what it was like to have to wait between trains. I wanted to deposit the check someplace, since I didn't like the idea of carrying it around in my wallet. But I hadn't seen Todd in a long time. And I worried it would be in bad taste to talk about money. I'd known Todd since college. He moved to the city a few years ago, and he was living off a fellowship that allowed him to work full time on a biography he was writing of an American political theorist named Stephen Taubes. I knew little about Taubes other than that Todd and his roommate Brandon, who was helping him with the biography, thought very highly of him and were working closely with his estate. Todd's work could take years to finish, he told me. There was much to be cleared up for the record, and a good deal of intellectual rehabilitation was in store. I didn't ask him what he meant by this. But when he offered to bring me on as a research assistant, and after he mentioned in passing that Taubes's history had been contentions for many years and weighted down by controversy, I quickly learned that some things were better left unspoken. And then we were at Don's, and we used to know this guy who worked there. And he came up to us and started talking, and Casey and I were all of a sudden taking directions to his apartment. And we must've been wasted, because it was four in the morning, and then, all of a sudden, he was there, and he was telling us what he was selling. It was so weird! What time did you get back? I don't know, like 8:00. I was so tired! Was Mandy there? No. Mandy thankfully was not there. Who's Mandy? You met Mandy. She's the girl with the really long hair. She's kind of tall. No, you know! She was at Conner's thing in April. Is this the one who faked the abortion? She is such a wreck. Very strange. Very fun-house. So, do you even know what this thing is? What does this guy do? I think it's a video installation based on '90s TV shows. And then he syncs them up to old clips of Waco and O.J. Shows? You mean sitcoms? That sounds good. I had two job interviews. My brother gave me an old suit to wear, but it didn't fit me well, and I needed to find a tailor who could shorten the arms and legs by the end of the week. There was a box of videotapes on the floor among the papers in Todd's apartment. When I mentioned this, Todd told me that Taubes kept video recordings of all of his travels during the last 20 years of his life. Most of my work would be devoted to itemizing these tapes and describing their contents. We watched one of them for a few minutes. Sometimes voices were heard and faces were seen. But I didn't understand what the tapes were for or why they were made. Usually, the camera stayed put, or else the video cut abruptly to a different view. I rarely saw anyone in any of these recordings. Their importance was unclear. - How do you know each other? - From Bard. We were in the same program. - Is this your first time here? - No. I came last summer to look for an apartment, but I ended up staying with my parents. Where are you from? - Chappaqua. - And you already found a job? Not yet, but I have two interviews next week. - Where? - One is for a part-time clerical job at a law office. The other's in Tribeca, at a restaurant. Have you thought about tutoring? - I've never tutored before. It can pay well. You're a good enough writer. I'm sure you can find something through an agency. What do you write? I haven't written much since school. I'm writing some short stories now. - Have you published anything? - Not yet, but I'm trying to. Oh, you should. At your age, you should be placing pieces in as many outlets as possible. - Do you write? - Sometimes. I'm finishing a dissertation and I translate, so that takes up most of my time. I can introduce you to someone, if you're interested in tutoring. Thanks. I don't want to be a bother. - It's not a bother. He may have some ideas. - Should we go? - Mm-hmm, do you want to walk? - Yeah, that's fine. Let's walk. I made a pot of coffee and wrote for a little while after they left. From the fifth floor, you could see the rest of the neighborhood. There was a big construction site across the street, for a new apartment building, I think. Todd told me that the whole area would be unrecognizable in a year. I tried to imagine the new view. He's farther away here. We can crop it later. This one's clearer. Something like this? Is that one recent? I have a few more from April. This one's from last winter. Are they coming here? - His father might. I don't know. Did he know anyone else in the city? - I spoke to his cousin. Maybe he can help. - Can we talk to him? He knows I'm here. I can call him again. - Do you know where he lives? He lives in Queens. - I work now. I don't have the time I had five or six months ago. Even if he did, I doubt I'd have a chance to see him. We're both working overtime. Diana's parents have had to help us. My father's trying to get my foreman to renegotiate my contract. But I'd still be taking home less than I did last year. David's parents made things very difficult for me and my wife. They cheated my parents out of a lot. My grandmother was very sick, and they refused to take her. I know my father doesn't speak to them anymore, and we don't ever hear from David, but I never stopped him from trying to call us. - Do you ever talk to Julius? Not a lot. I don't think he kept in touch with David. Who's Julius? He was a good friend of my brother's. He went to high school with David. Should we talk to him? - He doesn't live here anymore. I haven't seen him in years. I can try to find the address, but I'd really prefer it if you didn't tell him you came here. How you doing? How are you? Man, I had to work since nine or 10. Really? Yeah, last time I went in, I went in. This was last time. Where at, here? No, the lake on Cathcart, I was carrying my son. - We'd like to get started. Thank you for coming. This is the first of three panels on translation. In October, we'll be joined by Natasha Wimmer, who will discuss her experience translating Alvaro Enrigue's Sudden Death, which was put out by Riverhead Books in February. Tonight, we're fortunate to have three very smart, very talented translators, whom I'll introduce, starting with Keith Cohen, to my left. Keith's translation of Danilo Kis's Early Sorrows is forthcoming with Dalkey Archive Press, and he's a frequent contributor to n+1, The Believer, Tin House, and Bookforum. In July, Keith was named one of our most promising young translators of fiction and poetry into English by the New York Times, and in April he received a Guggenheim fellowship for his work in literary criticism. To Keith's left is Christian Haley, an editor at Triple Canopy and a frequent contributor to The New Inquiry, Bookforum, the London Review of Books, and n+1. In March, Archipelago Books will publish his translations of Kleist's poetry and prose. Christian is also a professor of German Studies at Sarah Lawrence and is currently editing a volume on Friedrich Schleiermacher and 19th-century German theology, expected from Princeton University Press in January. To his left is Karin Apter. Karin is a doctoral candidate in Comparative Literature at Columbia University and has written extensively on Latin American literature, poetry and politics. Her work can be found in the London Review of Books, Jacobin, Harper's, Dissent, Cinema Scope, The New Inquiry, the Times Literary Supplement, and most recently in n+1, for which she's translated poems by Roberto Bolano. In December, her translations of Garc√≠a Lorca will be published by New Directions, and she's currently preparing a book on Fernando Solanas and Argentine cinema. Our format tonight will be three talks followed by a brief question-and-answer session, during which we'll open up the floor for discussion. Please join me in welcoming our panelists. And I was just sort of wondering, because you mentioned Danilo Kis, right? This thing that happens where writers become more famous in countries than their own, is this just a problem of publishing in general? - Because all of us read more than one language, right? So, I wanted to ask if you could speak to this issue of displacement, when you have this slippage and when you want to say something but somehow it... Do we think of this as just another failure of late capitalism, or as another homogenizing impulse of capitalism as it expands? Please join me in thanking our panelists. Do you think this is uninteresting? - I think it's beneath you. Why are you so preoccupied with it? Because he's a friend of mine. - But what does it matter? You did what you could. Do you think he's going to come back and scold you? - No, I don't think that. Then why do you feel guilty about it? - I don't know if I feel guilty. You shouldn't. But I don't even know where he is or if he's safe. I think it's pointless to talk about this. He's gone. If he comes back, then he does. This is really so stupid. You're not even making an effort to be helpful. - Oh, get over yourself. You sound like a wounded mother. Some of us have been working very hard this past year on something that's incredibly important to the direction we want this country to go in, and what you're telling me has absolutely no importance. It's a non-event. It bores me, and I wish we wouldn't talk about it. It's a distraction, and as far as I'm concerned, it's something that never even happened. What time did you leave? Super late. God, I went home with Dane. What a horrible idea. Which one was Dane? He was the one that went to the Cooper Union. He came with Shane and Zerlina. You went to his place? No. We couldn't. I was like, "Dude, my place is all the way "out in Fort Greene." "My roommate's going to be there." And he's like, "No, no, it's fine." "Don't worry." So, we end up at my place. Shannon's door is already shut. We go into my room. The next morning, I get this really passive-aggressive E-mail that's telling me I can't bring boys over anymore because it's rude and inconsiderate. She said that to you? I'm not kidding. It's like, I'm sorry, I pay rent, I'm 26 years old. Get over yourself! That's ridiculous, man. You should get a new place. Try to kick her out. I wish. You know what you should do? You could kill her and make it look like an accident. Yeah! I'll do it for you. That's horrible. These are horrible times. Buying books? - Hi. We saw you through the window. - Sorry, I didn't recognize you. I was in Senegal for five weeks. Do you know Gabe? - I don't think so. Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Were you on your way? No, I just wanted to take a walk. - Why don't you join us? We're going to an opening. - An opening? - Gabe's friend's in a show. There's going to be a reception with drinks. - Oh. Do you have plans? - No, I don't have plans. - Come with us. It starts in an hour. - Do you usually do this? Would it bother you if I did? - I don't know. Don't you think it seems impulsive? I was bored. Does it matter? - No. I'll be gone in a few weeks. - Where are you going? Hungary. Maybe Romania. What are you doing in Hungary? - I don't know. Just see what it's like for a while. A few friends are coming. We've had enough of this city. There's nothing really keeping us here. What will you do for money? - I don't know. A friend's cooking dinner. If you come, you could talk to them. They'll all be there. We'll be celebrating our independence. Do you live in the neighborhood? - Nope. - Just visiting friends? - I was invited. I don't know any of the artists. We all went to school together. - Oh. - What do you do? - I'm a student. - In the city? - Yep. - Are you from around here? - No, I grow up in Arizona. - Do you ever go back? - Not really. Are you from New York? - No, I was born in Boston. My parents moved here when I was in middle school. - Your parents live in the city? - No, my father died on 9/11. My mother's very sick. We're not able to speak. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Are you expecting someone else? - No. Why don't we go to the other room? Most of this is gone now. When were these taken? At least 100 years ago. Ceausescu destroyed most of this. It isn't him. Doctor Stephens, Doctor Alfred Stephens. Doctor Powers, Doctor Edward Powers. Doctor Sholom, Doctor Stephen Sholom. Doctor Braiden, Doctor Anthony Braiden. - Are you hungry? I can't think of eating anything. I don't want to do anything. I want to leave. - How do you feel? I'm still tired. Do you want to go back to sleep? - No. I think I'll feel better when I'm on my way back. I can't think of anything else we can do. I think we did everything we could. - Part of me wants to stay. - Why? Because I don't think I did everything I could do. - Could you do anything more? He's not going to reappear because you keep looking for him. I know. I'm frightened. - Why are you frightened? What's frightening you? - I don't know. I don't want him to be gone. The idea of him not existing anymore frightens me. - But why do you think that? You'll see David again. I don't think I believe that anymore. - But you should believe it. I wish I could distract myself. - You can. - How? - By leaving. It's not difficult. Don't let this get to your head. I think of the words of the great Russian nihilist Nechayev when he says, Day and night, we must have but one thought, one aim, and that's death. The death of individuals, the death of consciousness, the death of politics. The true victory, the true freedom, isn't appeasement and compromise, but annihilation. They say that liberal democracy is the best of all possible worlds. They spit in our faces with their homilies. They give us platitudes about values. They poison us with their talk about the truth. But who are they to talk about values when their wallets grow thick each time they stab us in the back? Who are they to talk about truth? Who among us still believes in the lie about the sanctity of human life? Who among us can continue to go on walking on tiptoe for fear of offending the hypocrites, the scum, who have been peddling this garbage to us for the last 30 years? Let them suffer and disappear. I'm not going to answer their attacks on me by pleading. Their language of reform is appalling and unworthy of me. What they don't realize is that there are more of us than they think. One day, and I promise you one day, and it won't be long from now, this entire sickly order is going to implode. It won't announce itself outright. It's not going to be a matter of barricades or slogans. But I promise, it will happen. We are not going away. - Hi. Hi. - Where have you been? We thought something had happened. No, I was taking Madeleine to the station. - Everything all right? Yeah. - We're all inside. How was the food? It was fine. Moroccan food is cheap. We found these great tajines in Chefchaouen. Where's that? This is the wall of the Medina in Fez. I'll see you when you get back. - You sure? - I'm tired. It wouldn't make sense. This may be our last chance to go. I know, but I'd rather stay here. What do you want me to tell them? That I'm not feeling well and need to sleep. I wouldn't be good company.
