- I didn't know what punk was, 'cause there was no punk rock. When I was a kid, I just knew I was pissed off. It was a fucking angry life, until I found punk rock. It just made me happy, you know.

And I went down to their one-room office and they just started, and they had a handful of singles, and I actually bought, you know, I can't remember if it was like, 10 or 20 of each, and I put them in my suitcase and I brought them back and Rhino was the first store-- - [Voiceover] In LA. - First store, I think it was the first store in America to stock Stiff Records. - [Voiceover] Which is considered the birth of punk. - Right, it was definitely, I mean, they had non-punk as well, but they had a lot of punk acts. And it was part of, '76 was really when it started-- - [Voiceover] The Damned. - Right, The Damned, the Sex Pistols-- - [Voiceover] The Clash. - Right, The Clash, who evolved out of the 101ers. The 101ers were playing in '76. And in the '70s, it was really not a good time because in the early '70s you had soft rock, you had James Taylor and you had the Asylum Records and The Eagles and all that stuff, and you know, that wasn't rock and roll to me. And then, in the mid-'70s, then all of a sudden, you had disco. And, you know, disco, that wasn't rock and roll. So when I started to see the energy from the whole punk scene here-- ♪ Vertigo ♪ Oh no ♪ Vertigo ♪ Let's go ♪ Vertigo ♪ Oh no ♪ Vertigo ♪ Things are getting frantic on the panic train ♪ - Eerily enough, kind of in the mid-'70s, there was this, kind of like this period where I was sort of like drifting around a little bit. Not quite sure of what I was going to do next. I tried starting a couple of bands. And actually, I started a band with Charlotte Caffey and Joe Nanini, who went on to become, you know, like part of the Go-Go's and Wall of Voodoo. And we were looking for a little bit louder style of music, but we didn't really know how to address it, because none of the clubs would let anybody play loud-- - [Voiceover] No club dates. - There was no clubs, it was just singer songwriters and these endless acoustic audition nights and we would go with our little Champ Amps but if you turned them past one, you'd get booted out, so [laughs] obviously that wasn't working. And finally The Ramones came to LA and played at The Whisky to literally 10 people. And we were among those 10, and we were just crying our eyes out, 'cause it was the first amplified music we'd heard in five or six years. And right after that, amazingly enough, was when punk rock hit LA. [punk rock music] It started right about then. One of them was the Germs, the other was the Weirdos and the third was the Screamers. And those three bands really were the three first, I would say, punk rock bands in LA. There may be couple of others that were sort of forming at that time. I came along and joined a band called The Bags, me and Joe Nanini joined a band called The Bags, and The Bags was one of, you know, right after that they're like maybe the fourth, or fifth, I don't know what, punk rock band in LA at that time. And that was also around the time that this punk club called The Masque started. And The Masque was really the progenitor of the LA punk scene, because The Masque was a rehearsal place where we also had shows. I was sort of like the resident house sound man. I slept on the floor, you know, by day, and at night I set up all this scrap equipment to make a PA out of old amplifiers and stuff. And bands would just play in the middle, right on the floor of this rehearsal place. ♪ As I crave, I consume 'em but I don't give ♪ I got you caught in my eye ♪ I got you caught in my eye ♪ I got you caught in my eye again ♪ I got you caught in my eye ♪ I got you caught in my eye ♪ I got you caught in my eye again ♪ I got you caught in my eye ♪ I never got along with the girls at my school ♪ Filling me up with all their morals and their rules ♪ They'd pile all their problems on my head ♪ I'd rather go out and fuck the dead ♪ 'Cause I can do what I want - But the way that I got into punk rock, it's like I was a fuck up in school, you know. I'd been kicked out of every school in the district. So my first kick out was in sixth grade. You know, first time I got high was nine. You know, whiffing Pam and all of that other shit you do. And the way I got into it, there was this girl and she goes, "You're fucked." She goes, "You're fucked." And I'm going, "Why, why?" She goes, "You're just an asshole," and I go, "Yeah." She goes, "I know these guys that are just like you. "You should meet them." And I went over and it turned out that was the drummer for TSOL. That's how I met him, you know, 'cause she said, "Look, you guys are both criminals." And it's funny, 'cause I met her at her house, I met him at her house, and we said, "Hey, you want to start a band?" And I go, "Yeah, let's start a band." So we took her shit. Like, she had stuff, just, you know, we took it and just said, "Hey, fuck you, this is ours." - [Voiceover] Guitar or something? - Yeah, guitar, and a little amp. We couldn't tune, so we just had two strings, we'd just use the top two, you know, and did one finger stuff. And then we'd just go around stealing. That's how we got our stuff. Like, you know, schools, you steal from schools. Like, our first drum was a marching drum. And we'd just lay there on its side, you know, banged. Fuck you! And just yell and fuck at the neighbors and play and you know, and then we'd steal stuff. Like churches. Like churches are unbelievable for stealing, because it's sanctuary, you know what I'm sayin'? So the door are always open. It's like, fuck, clueless. So you go in there and you tip over the holy water and piss on the alter and grab the mics. And take what you, I mean, I feel bad now. You can see that I'm remorseful, you know. - [Voiceover] [laughs] - As far as I knew, everybody that made a band with their friends, put out a record and thousands of people liked them. I didn't know anything else. It's like I had no other, I didn't know that people work all their lives to try to get popular, I just thought, hey, that's what you do. Make a band, fuck stuff up. Get paid, rape, pillage. I mean, Biafra got pissed at me one time. I don't know if he remembers this. He was asking me, he wanted some, you know, he wanted some political answer out of me. He wanted me to back something. And he asked me about what I was in it for, and I go, "Man, I'm in it to fuck girls." I'm in it to rob and steal and fuck girls. What do you want? That's what I was in for. I mean, it was the best job. I mean, I was just out of high school, and it's like, hey, somebody's gonna pay me to fuck shit up? You know what I mean? It's like, I'm gonna get money to sleep with five girls a day, steal and rob, you know, get up and be the man, and here's cash, you know, it's like, fuck. ♪ Superficial love ♪ Only for a fuck ♪ But love is incest ♪ And it's only for a buck ♪ Eating to survive, surviving for free ♪ Peace time, war time, try to draft me ♪ All die for this land ♪ Some are overseas Early on, to be a punk, you had to be pretty committed. You know what I mean? It was a commitment. It wasn't a fuckin' Friday night trip, you know what I'm saying? It was a week-long thing. You know, your parents hated you, the fuckin' school hated you. - [Voiceover] 24 seven. - 24 seven, your ass is getting kicked, you know what I mean? It was a lot of people, that I think got into punk rock just 'cause they were fuck ups. A lot of the bands like, Early Ax, I dug, you know what I mean? And The Plugs, like going to see The Plugs, man, it was great. And The Weirdos and, you know, so many cool bands. And seeing the Germs, and UXA, and all these bands you go see, and, I don't know, most of those people, it was like the old black blues guys. You know what I mean? It's like these people were ripped off. And the thing is, then a lot of us didn't have that business sense. We weren't in it for business. Nowadays these kids are in it for money and business, that's what it's about. - [Voiceover] Economic nature - Yeah, it's not fuckin' punk rock, it's fucking money and business. And back then, it was like, yeah, what, you're gonna give me a six-pack, I'll sign. You know what it's like. I never had a lawyer look at anything. I mean, that may be stupid, you know, and I'm paying for it now, whatever, I'm still broke, but the fact is, that wasn't the primary, the music was the primary focus, not the business. ♪ I was so wasted, I was so wasted ♪ I was a hippie ♪ I was a burnout ♪ I was a dropout ♪ You know I was out of my head ♪ I was a surfer ♪ I had a skateboard ♪ I was so heavy, man - [Voiceover] Is that the music that excited you? When you say-- - I've always like loud, in your face, fuck you, kind of music. You know? Anything that was gonna, like, irritate any of the other people around me, I was pretty much into. - [Voiceover] When did you start playing with Greg-- - I started playing with Greg, it would have been towards the end of '77. He was always into the same things that I was into. We were all into, like, [mumbles], Ted Nugent, Thin Lizzy, the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones, Patti Smith. He was a big Grateful Dead fan, which was kind of strange for the equation. So that seems like the one piece to the puzzle that doesn't really fit, but, hey-- - [Voiceover] Interesting. - Everybody has some weird, off the wall, something that-- - [Voiceover] Barbra Streisand. - Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, you know, Wayne Newton. - [Voiceover] Wayne Newton. - Slim Whitman, somebody like that. - [Voiceover] When you started to see that the Orange County influx of people that were starting to really start to like the kind of music you were playing, and that there was a growing audience, I mean, do you remember during what year that was? '78, '79? - It was probably about '78, early '79. 'Cause it took us a while-- - [Voiceover] It took a year or so to-- - Yeah, it took a while, I mean, we played and paid our dues. I mean, we played parties. I remember we played a party in Inglewood in a basement, and I remember vividly the checkerboard floor being soaked in beer, ice, and water about that think, maybe an inch. - [Voiceover] And you're playing electric instruments. - Playing electric, I mean, the water hadn't gone all the way back to all the big powerful stuff. Only up front where the front man stands with the microphone, yes.

I mean, maybe not on the mainstream, ultra mega level, but all the record companies always had these types of characters on their labels because it gave them artistic credibility. It gave them street credibility and it basically said, "We're not just in this for the money. "There are people out there that we feel have "something to contribute on a creative level." Like they could say Captain Beefheart would be the equivalent to Pablo Picasso. - [Voiceover] Crowds were flocking. I mean, I remember in those days, more kids going to see your shows then they would go see cornball bands at the [mumbles] anymore. Punk shows where the most crowded, most energetic, and to me all-- - You have to take a look at the kids that were going to the shows, for one thing. - [Voiceover] Okay. - A lot of the kids from southern California, when I say southern California, I mean southern California, I don't mean, like, The Valley or places like that. I mean kids that were close to, they had access to the ocean, so there was a lot of surfing. A lot of skateboarders, skiiers. You know, in southern California we've always had a kind of a gung-ho, go for it, kind of attitude. - [Voiceover] Aggressive. - Aggressive.

I found skateboarding [background noise] settled my nerves and then as soon as punk rock came into play it fucking made me skate better. - [Voiceover] So that's what I wanted to ask you-- - Wanna play in a band. - [Voiceover] When you were skating prior to that, what were you listening to? Were you into music before punk music? - No, not at all. My sister took that all away from me. She was about 10 and a half months older than me and I used to have to come home to my fucking pile of shit little sister who was older and it's just me and her and her dad, my dad, I guess, whatever, and cleaning up after rock and roll pieces of shit just wasn't me fucking cup of tea and I fucking grabbed my skateboard and I'd split. That's where that came from. As soon as I heard The Ramones on a skateboard trip, it was, you know, it came to play. Before that all I had was Alice Cooper, and you could only skate to Alice Cooper so many years. [laughter] - [Voiceover] What year was that when you heard The Ramones? - '77, late '77 when I heard them. I didn't cut my hair till late '78. I didn't make a commitment till I heard Johnny Rotten. I was late in the game, man. Heard Johnny Rotten well after the record was out, and it just, filtered to me and it was just fucking serious. - [Voiceover] So do you think your skateboarding was totally changed by listening to punk rock-- - No, it made me want to fuckin' skate more maybe, but I don't think it changed. It just made me happy. To skate to fuckin' loud punk rock, there was nothing fucking greater, other than fucking a good chick. [punk rock music] - [Voiceover] You're not a star. - More than a star, more than a punk rock star - [Voiceover] All right! - More than a greasy star. - [Voiceover] Where's the beer? - More than a three triple bag star. - [Voiceover] Do you think it's gonna go, people will finally accept this overground, as opposed to always being pushed underground by the media? Do you think you're ever going to break through? - Nobody really breaks through, no way, there's no chance of that shit, you know what I mean? - [Voiceover] Yeah. - We've been putting out great records, man. I was listening to one of our records the other day, and it was like, I don't know why this thing didn't, but we don't know if we're being liked, we have no statements, but I guarantee you, we've never been on the radio, so I don't see anything real being really productive, fucking candy-coated America. Honestly, I mean, no doubt it's very huge. And that chick is the most annoying pile of shit I've ever fucking heard. I mean, besides fucking Save Ferris, [background noise], I mean, there's these great names, you know, but the, what the fuck is this? Bandos are making it to punk. I mean, on our scene, these bandos marching geeks that can't make it in school are fucking, and straw bands, [makes band noises] Give 'em a vest. - [Voiceover] I was going to ask you-- - Let's all go together. Fuck, what the fuck. ["Solitary War" by Gitane Demone] - I guess it was around '80 or something and I was doing some heavy metal. And I got really sick of it because it was just the same kind of thing, it wasn't really my trip, but I was aggressive, very aggressive female. And I didn't really know, I'd go out to venues, to Al's Bar, to the Whisky to the Roxy, all different kinds of places around, and go check out punk bands. But I was really shy to meet people. So, um, I was aggressive but shy. And then I threw an ad in The Recycler I met Valor and we started a band called Pompeii '99. Yeah, we started playing and we had a record release party for this and Rozz came to it. I'd never, I'd seen him play live and I was totally intrigued with him and he cameo-- - [Voiceover] What band was he? - He was in Christian Death. Yeah he'd done Only Theatre of Pain and he was playing with the original lineup. By the time he came to the record release party he was getting off the track with them. For some reason he didn't want to play with them anymore. He came and he met us, and I was actually too shy to talk with him, and I'd never seen anyone like him in front of me before. - [Voiceover] Intensly charismatic. - Yeah, incredible, I was like, "Woah, who is that?" Then, apparently, Rozz wanted to meet me. I was pregnant, I was only a few, I guess four months pregnant with my son, at the time, and I went to his birthday party and I walked in all kind of bloated and big. I walked in and there are all these immaculate women dressed up as men. About a hundred of them at a birthday party, and I felt like, oh, very, very feminine in this kind of really masculine woman image. And I felt completely out of it. But I met him, and he was great, and he was interested in having me do backing vocals and keyboards-- - [Voiceover] So he had heard your voice-- - He'd heard my voice, yeah, and he liked Pompeii '99 a lot. We did some opening shows for him and 45 Grave. We were mixed into that, but we weren't actually deathrock at the time. We were doing something very dark, but different. ♪ I accept the gift of sin ♪ The gift of pleasure is bleeding ♪ To smother the words ♪ The four walls drain me dry ♪ Of all imagination ♪ Crying out to be told to stand still ♪ Crying out to be told to be - Fascinated with the dark mysteries of life. - [Voiceover] Like we would read Edgar Allan Poe as opposed to Cinderella. - [Gitane] Sure yeah, and I was reading a lot of odd stuff. Surrealism and stuff even though I couldn't understand a lot of it when I was a young teenager. - [Voiceover] So your evolution as a woman kind drew you into this whole musical scene. - Yeah, I didn't really, it was very subconscious. I didn't understand it. I was always dressing in very dark colors and I'd ask my mom, "Why am I always wearing this? "I don't want to wear this." I think that Rozz and the deathrockers here really created their own thing. I really do. And it came out of punk. And it was a combination theatrics, a need to be more dramatic and visually expressive. Everybody was just sort of, to use a cliche term, tuned in with what was happening at the time. The need, the desperation. - [Voiceover] For truth-- - For getting this thing out of their soul. To meld, to be one, to feel not alone. To feel not alone. To share, yeah, to share this feeling. - [Voiceover] Disorientation from their families. - Definitely, disorientation from everything. Yeah, from being a unique sort, outside of all the other categories that were laid out. From school, from tradition, from everything that was laid out. Okay, we're alone, we're weirdos. Who can we talk to? Who can we sing to, who can we play to? Who can we be with, who understands? And this was one thing that happened, everybody's got their own thing.

And I said, "Oh yeah, what band is that?" And my friend said, "Oh, they're called the Germs." I said, "Oh, I've got their record, I just got it." And I listened to it again, because I guess I hadn't really listened to it before. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard at the time. The B side was just this mess. It was this live thing that made The Velvet Underground White Light White Heat album sound like a techno record. It was amazing, it was just unbelievable. It was just garbled noise. It was the Forming single and the song on the B side was called Sexboy, although on the record it just says Germs: Live. Well, I thought that was pretty insane, and I thought, "Wow, this would be something I can do, "and I can move to LA, I could join this amazing band, "and life would be wonderful." So, I called them up, I got their phone numbers from this person, I guess they knew them peripherally. And I called Pat and Darby and talked to them about music. I asked Pat, "So are you into all these punk bands?" I named all these esoteric punk bands that I liked, like Subway Sect, like, I don't know, Metal Urbaine, and these weird punk bands I thought were pretty happening at the time, late '77. And he said, "Well, actually, I'm really into Queen, "and Yes and I like David Bowie a lot." And that was like he said some kind of Sid Ko-an, you know. I was just like [reverberating]. What, that was brilliant. I thought, "My God, they do this music, and, wow." So I called Darby, the singer, and he said pretty much the same things. I said, "Wow, well, I'm a drummer, "I want to come and join your band. "You guys sound pretty interesting." I mean, I'm going to move to California and I'm going to join your band. And he said, "Uh, okay." Like, whatever, if you want to, yeah, I don't know. And then Darby proceeded to regale me with two hours of stories about all these people that I didn't know in the LA punk scene and their weird sexual quirks and scandalous behavior of all sorts. He was like Kenneth Anger or something, a Hollywood Babylon kind of thing. Except all these people were young and alive. In the bathroom there, like, auditioning for these guys, who I had given up an entire life in Phoenix, to be in their band, which I was never actually certain that I was going to be in. I'm bashing on my [background noise] in this bathroom stall, they're looking pretty concerned. "Could you play a song?" And I remembered that Nicky Beat had actually given me a drum list, my one drum list. And he had taught me how to play a Weirdo song called Life of Crime, it was very simple. [mumbles] and most people. But I learned how to play it, and I played that. In that stall, for about a minute, and then that was that. I was hoping they wouldn't ask me to do anything else. And they didn't, they went outside of the bathroom and deliberated. And apparently the conversation went something like, "What do you think?" "I don't know, what do you think?" "Well, he did come from Phoenix." "Anyone that would come that far just to join this band, "must be kind of worth trying, anyway." So, they came back and Darby said, "Well, you're a Germ." - [Voiceover] Did you have a alcohol in front of you? - Well, you know, everything. - [Voiceover] Sex and drugs and punk. - Yeah, but you know, with the Germs, they were a little too much for all that, so that wasn't enough. Most people were way beyond sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. It was utter chaos, and it was so much fun. - [Voiceover] Do you think that Darb was the kind of personality that liked that. - Liked it, yeah. Liked it, he thrived on it, and created it if it wasn't there already. So, oh yeah, he was great. In high school, he was this amazing LSD prankster. He would do things like sneak announcements onto the PA system, for the whole high school. Like, that Led Zeppelin had been killed in a plane crash. And all the stoners in the class would start weeping and he'd laugh. - [Voiceover] That's funny. - Yeah, he was good. He's really into Scientology and stuff like that also. Various mind control techniques. Nietzsche and philosophy and Gurdjieff and L. Ron Hubbard, and Hilter, you know, just interested in all of the various forms of mind control. He was a one-man cult and personality. - [Voiceover] So you really saw this? - He was great, he has more charisma than Jesus. ["Too Drunk to Fuck" by Dead Kennedys] - Punk happened at the perfect time for me because it was a very, very depressing time to come of age in the mid to late 1970s. And howl amongst our friends, "We missed the sixties!" All that fire, all that fun, it's all mellowed out and made into hanging plants and what's now called yuppies and New Age and even long hair, which scared the living daylights out of people was now on the heads Lynyrd Skynyrd when they were playing benefits for George Wallace and stuff. It was just, something new had to replace the rebellion that reached its peak when it was fighting against the Vietnam War. Plus, of course, music by the mid to late seventies was, for the most part, totally laughable. Alex Harvey, the Scottish glam-rock star, predicted in an interview, that before long a whole new generation of people were going to come in who wanted nothing to do with Coliseum Rock and all the elitist pomp that went with it. He predicted that, and within two years, thankfully it happened. So instead of being a bad time to be alive, suddenly it was the dawn of another era. Which I could feel unfolding by the time I was out in San Francisco. I left school out of two months, left college after two months, 'cause I wanted to dive headfirst into punk rock and be a part of that. I mean, I could tell my grandchildren I saw The Avengers and The Dils back when. And if I was really lucky, maybe even get a little single out of my own music to show that I actually pulled something off at some point. - [Voiceover] Had you been playing music? Were you artistic, drawing, going to art class? How did you-- - I'm a real good example of how punk enabled somebody with absolutely no musical talent whatsoever on paper, by serious music standards, could make their own music and make an impact. I've never [mumbles] my friends with musical instruments, I just made up the music in my head, and would sing it to Klaus, he'd transpose it to Ray and we'd turn it into songs. [punk rock music] And in New York, and on the East Coast, it was over-21 scene. Even though CBGC's was connected with punk, and so was Max's in New York, they were established rock venues. You had to have an ID to get in, they were not all-ages shows, and so once the initial wave of New York people got signed and got bigger, what followed was either, like, leftover glamo-bar bands who really didn't have much going for them, or stuff that was really, really arty and meant for-- - [Voiceover] Talking Heads. - Adults. Well no, post Talking Heads, and more importantly, post James Chance, post Lydia Lunch. And so, you know, I couldn't have done it anywhere but in San Francisco. And a large part of the credit, I would say, would go to Dirk Dirksen, who had the foresight to make the Mabuhay Garden shows all-ages. I was 19 when Dead Kennedys started. And a lot of the people in those early bands were under 21. If they had to wait till they were 21, they might have gotten more serious about their careers or something and never stuck their necks out at all. You know, it's important to do these things when you don't know enough not to. Kind of like when I ran for mayor, or something like that. Punk was a much more wide-open term then. It wasn't just Skank Or Die and stuff like that. It was anybody who was sick of the seventies and wanted to be part of something new and exciting was there, be it Bruce Conner, the old filmmaker, taking the photos, to Mark Pauline whose project evolved into survival research labs. The Voice Farm people who were electronic and what not.

So we had to grow, and to us, to me, selling out would be doing the same record every time. That's a fucking sellout. Because I know what people are gonna buy, you know, people talk about now, sellout, sellout, all this crap, back then, to me, what people were wanting from TSOL was a three-chord political record saying, "Fuck Reagan," or whoever was in there now, Carter or Reagan or I don't even know who we got now, but whatever-- - [Voiceover] Same thing. - So we're not going to do that. We're gonna do something else. And then we're going to do something else after that, and we're going to something else after that. To me, it was always changes. Like, you know, using pianos, using keyboards, doing whatever-- - [Voiceover] People put you down, I remember back then, when some of these new punk bands started up and thought that Jack Grisham had sold out. - Selling out, for me, is saying the same thing every fucking time, 'cause I know that's what they're gonna buy. You know what I mean? And I won't do it, and I still won't do it, you know what I mean? I get people pissed at me all the time. My mother used to get pissed 'cause I'd change my name every record, you know what I mean? She's go, "What's the matter with you?" And the reason why I changed my name every record, it just to show people it didn't matter. Our whole troupe was a no rock star, no hero thing, that was our bag. So this record, I'm going to be Jack Grisham, next record I'm gonna be fuck all, you know, or whatever, Alex Morgan, Jack Greggors, Jack Lloyd, whatever, I changed my name all the time, 'cause it didn't matter who was in the band. And for me, it's always been small. They've always been independent labels, and the one thing, you think back, yeah, it's like, TSOL, we could headline a show at the Palladium, and there'd be 5,000 people, they'd be sold out, and not one major record company would talk to us. And if you took a band today-- - [Voiceover] How do explain that, that's insane. - I don't care, fuck 'em, I wouldn't have got along with them anyway. I would have ended up punching one out, so it's like, I remember this one record company hired my buddy to go with me so I wouldn't attack anybody in the band. It's like, okay, we'll pay you to sit with him. You know, will you babysit during the meeting? You know what, fuck 'em, who wanted them anyway? I didn't. And God, all I needed man, is just to have some fuck hole tell us we're out of tune or we're not hitting something right or we're doing, I remember this guy, one of those idiots pulled a gun on me one time, in a studio, some Hollywood fucknut was doing whatever-- - [Voiceover] What a coke dealer or whatever? - No, I called him some racial slur, you know what I mean? Just to be fucked, you know what I mean. It's like, I don't care, you know what I mean? I looked at him, I said, "Hey, you fuckin' yeah, yeah." - [Voiceover] Yadda, yadda. - And the guy goes, "Ah!" And he starts choking up. And he goes, "I didn't do two fuckin' tours of 'Nam "to have some little punk-ass bitch like you, "where's my pistol?" Fuck you, you know, what are you going to do, shoot me, you fuck, whatever. So I'm glad they stayed away anyway. I wouldn't have got along with 'em. - We were not under any scrutiny by any major record labels. - [Voiceover] Now, why do you think that is? - Because the music we were playing was too offensive. It was too fast, it was too loud, it was abrasive. - [Voiceover] But a big crowd. - Basically, what we were playing was everything they didn't want to hear. - [Voiceover] Now, you're talking radio, record people. - Yes. - [Voiceover] What about-- - No, there were people amongst all those other people that were interested in what we were doing. And got a kick out of what we were doing. And knew that we were doing something that was not part of the mainstream. But, they could not do anything to help us maybe make a few suggestions, but they could not do anything to help us because it really wasn't in their interest. - By early 1978, the major record companies had decided they wanted nothing to do with punk. The ongoing feelers and negotiations with people like The Avengers, the Mods, Crimes, and I'm guessing the LA bands, too, all of sudden just snipped, like that. And The Dickies were the last ones to get signed. And if I recall, Leonard had a relative at A and M or something and then no more bands connected with punk or even any kind of powerful, independent underground was signed again till who-sker-do almost a decade. It was, um, they decided that punk from then on would be the stuff we don't want to sign, but we will push New Wave. Necktie bands, who bop around onstage and smile and sing girly-poo songs and will do whatever some idiot in a satin baseball jacket who still listens to Eric Clapton at the record company tells them to do. And so, unlike England, where there was always, because of the Sex Pistols were a top-10 chart band, there was always more punk, it was more powerful there. Here, to stick around, you kind of had to make a decision, we're doing this because we like the music and we don't give a fuck whether or not we get signed and put on a leash by somebody at Sire Records or something. - When you write a record, if you give a fuck what you're doing, you want to write a good fucking record, you want to write what's going on in the moment, or in between records, or wherever you're at. And you don't want to repeat yourself and you want to, you know, you're on something, so you wanna, but, and you wanna keep it buried too. And it's like, fucking, you gotta, you gotta think night and day, you know. If you give a fuck what you're doing, you're up, I mean, you get, you have a relationship, it goes to shit. Everything goes to shit when you're writing. You turn into a freak, not that you're not already, but it just goes outside, and then, I mean, the arguments and everything that goes with it. The no sleeping, the band arguments, when you take something there, you got a concept, these guys got another concept, you know, it's a constant feud, but it's all for one cause. And everybody knows that. They thought we were going to kill each other or something, that's the way we write. - [Voiceover] They didn't get the fact you were passionate about your art. - It's not passionate, it's just being pissed off and standing behind what you want to do, and the way you want it to be, and then he wants the same thing, and then it's all about who's going to give up half his change in his pocket, you know. And that's what we'd do, you know, and that's okay, you know, that's the way we write, and there's plenty of shit to write that way. Anyway, with all these independent record companies and stuff, you can only do the dirt so long, I mean, you can only wash dishes so long, that's all I'm fucking capable of doing. I skateboard, that pays my rent right now. I'm 36 years old, I'm the oldest paid skateboarder there is. I've doing that all my life. My bones are fucked, I can't even go in the cold. They freeze up, when I go in the cold, because I'm not ready to pack it up. ♪ Dirty invitation is a rotten vacation ♪ Dole Heights, Chelsea Hotel dive ♪ Born sick in this spoon, shouted out ♪ I'm the last of the true ♪ Sidney - There was a lot of drugs. - [Voiceover] After you were pushing to have a concert? - Um, a lot of sex going on afterwards, a lot of picking up, a lot of drugs, and you know, drugs on stage, as well. A lot of drugs, there was bottles of amyl nitrate being passed around-- - [Voiceover] As the performance was-- - Yeah, yeah, sure. - [Voiceover] Would you say that that helped gel the band together? - I don't know, I really don't know. [laughs] A lot of alcohol, I know from myself, I got fist fucked for the first time backstage while I was watching Ax, you know. Yeah, while they were performing. Yeah, and there was a lot of sex going on, a lot of sex. - [Voiceover] In the audience or in-- - On the sidelines, yeah, yeah, definitely. And, yeah, it was a big, the thing was to lose yourself to expression. Lose yourself to your desires and your expression, however you want to express it, and if anybody will join you and be involved in it also. And it was very dark, it was very dark. You know, there was the whole candle ritual going on, where you'd start the show, and there'd be a big candle on somebody's hand and it would, they'd light it, and by the end of the show, their hand would be completely covered in wax and the flame would be way down and that wax would have been poured on other hands. - [Voiceover] So the infliction of pain, and the endurance. - Yeah, exactly. I couldn't believe it one morning, we were having breakfast and Offspring comes on, no, Green Day, it was around the same time, and I'm going, and then my son was over, too, and he goes, "Yeah, this is the punk music now." And I go, took it off, I go, "No, it's not, it is not. "This has got nothing to do with punk." Punk is about anarchy. That's where it comes from. Not being a part of the system. The very fact that this band is on MTV and copying the music slightly, they can't even do it really properly, it's too smooth-- - [Voiceover] Right, it didn't have any jagged edges. - No, no, no, it's, I doubt if they even know what the word anarchy means, you know. And I put on some Dead Kennedys and some old real stuff, and I said, "This is what punk is, don't believe it, "don't believe it." 'Cause the punk thing was never about being a part of the system, it was about creating something outside of it. - The sooner the corporate entertainment industry window closes the better, as far as I'm concerned. It is not any sort of victory for what punk originally meant to people, to hear a hard core thrash song in a Taco Bell ad. I don't care, it's still not going to get me to go to Taco Bell, it may get me dead sick of that particular song, the same way I get sick of ♪ Like a rock You see this redneck-mobile crunching around on the mountains and stuff, with some had-act country guy inside singing about his truck or something. - Punk rock just happened to be the vehicle for those people that were doing that stuff at that time. Do you know what I'm saying? Like I said, it could have been disco. Okay, Saturday Night Fever's a punk rock movie, man, you know what I'm saying? They're fuckholes, you know what I mean, they're little disco crew, they were going around kicking ass. And I think, it's like rebels, it's whatever. And whether it's rap. I was so stocked on the rap stuff when it came out. I thought, yeah, that's fucking punk rock, man. The first time I heard N.W.A, I said, "That is punk rock." That is just fucking, that rules, you know. - [Voiceover] Punk rock can be in a myriad of styles of music or sounds, as long as it has the actual spirit of rebellion. - Right, or the whole thing, or just doing something that people don't like. People going against whatever it is. It's like I used to tell people, you know, I had my hair done like Marilyn Monroe with a tube top and a dress, playing lounge music with a fucking cello behind me, and I'd look at these guys and go, "You think what you're doing's punk?" This is punk, this is fucked up, man. And now, I think a lot of the stuff now, you know, it's hard to tell who's on your team, now. 'Cause anybody can sound-- - [Voiceover] Like, watch your back-- - It's like, yeah, because the music, it's so, it's Goddamn, punk rock today, it's a Sprite commercial. You know what I mean, it's fucked. I look at these kids, I got in a fight with these kids, I looked at them, I said, "You fucking idiots." You learned your life from a fucking Pepsi commercial, man. You dress like it, you fucking drink it, you listen to that sound, that MTV punk rock sound. And you think it's punk, it's not. It's not, it's a fucking joke. - One thing that broke my heart about the early, my early times in San Francisco was seeing some of the greatest bands I will ever see in my life, playing some of the greatest shows I've ever seen in my life and nobody was recording them. Nobody had any money to make records. And so I felt like if I ever came into money or walked in to see there's a trust fund baby, or something like that, this is what I would do, is would try and get these bands on tape before they blew apart. I mean, The Avengers could have made three albums worth of songs, all of which would be classics today. Same for The Screamers, same for The Sleepers, and the rest of them. It's some of the best music I've ever heard, was lost to history and I didn't want that to happen anymore. So when Dead Kennedys got well-known and popular in England it was just a fluke, a sheer stroke of luck. When we went to the east coast and lost our shirts on a little tour before we'd even put a record out, we left a few of the early copies of California Uber Alles that Ray had pressed up behind, and somebody from Fast Records, who was a hot label in England at the time, whose first few singles were by bands with names like Gang of Four, Mekons, Human League, and they wanted to re-release California Uber Alles on Fast. And so it took off like a rocket in England, it was like nothing England or Europe had ever heard before. For the most part, except for The Ramones and The Dickies, they were completely unaware of what American punk was about, let alone, that it was because it had been squashed underground for so long, it had become a great deal heavier, more demented and more insane than British punk has ever been. Why are you the only good band in America? I'm saying, "No, that's not true at all." There's DOA, there's Black Flag, there's Flipper, there's the Bad Brains, there's Circle Jerks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, so I figure at that point we've got to resurrect Alternative Tentacles and put out a compilation album to blow open Europe for the American Underground, which is what Let Them Eat Jellybeans! was. And ironically, it then spilled back around and got well known enough in America that it helped crack open the United States as well. Because, of course, people could take that record home for the Dead Kennedys song and then realize that there was a band right in their town who was doing equally important things, and maybe it's time to get off their butts and support them. ["Sex Bomb" by Flipper] - I was lucky enough to be in three of the biggest bands in LA. - [Voiceover] I mean, they sound fucking good. - Nothing, it's what's really funny though, is not one of them ever did anything outside of LA. - [Voiceover] But they spawned other groups-- - 45 Grave toured, but it was never really much outside of LA, it's crazy. I don't know why. It couldn't, I tell you why. From The Germs to Vox Pop to 45 Grave, Celebrity Skin, and even more recently to a band, the 3 Day Stubble, that I played with, it doesn't translate quite as well to record as it could. The Germs were the closest, I think. But, it's a live thing, you had to be there. It wasn't just about a bunch of guys on a stage playing music. It was a thing. It was a whole thing. And whatever it was, it not something that was translatable. [upbeat music] - I met all these people that kissed me 'cause in The Times one time, there was this big quote. I said, "Getting hurt is healthy." And it is, I think back, you know when you're a kid, you're jumping on the bed, and your parents say, "Hey, hey, stop, stop." And it's like fuck, you're going and going and they're going, "Look, you're going to get hurt, "stop, stop, stop." And you go, you go, you go, and then you bounce off and you crack your fucking head and split your head open, right? So you get hurt, but the point of the whole thing is, is that you pushed the envelope of fun as far as it could go. You couldn't have any more fun, 'cause you had got an injury. You'd sustained an injury. So I used to think, look, if I don't come home with an ice pick in my neck, or a fucking, you know what I mean, I didn't push it as fun as it could go. You know what I mean? If I'm not over in Emergency, getting stitched up, then the night was unsuccessful. - I'm down with the working class and all that crap, but I don't want to be part of the working class-- - [Voiceover] You're an artist. - I've got my little fucking backyard label, I'm happy with the living. If I can just make ends meet, I'm fine, man. If I can keep my head just a little bit above water, and breathe most of the time, I'm fucking fine. - [Voiceover] Do you find anybody that you respect anymore? - Yeah, Shane MacGowan with Flying Colors and Keith Richards, um, but Keith Richards is a hero. I mean, outspoken, it makes me want, I mean, fuck it makes me want to grow old because that, to me, is fucking genius, living proof that everybody's wrong and all the doctors are a lie. 'Cause I tell my chick, if I ever get cancer, or any of that shit, you better let me fucking die, because I can't afford to stay alive. And that's what part of this fucking thing's about. This whole system set up for you to fucking lose. Done it all my life, I've been every kind of freak you can think about, you know. - [Voiceover] Go back to what you were saying. Individuality, to me, is really missing in United States of America now-- - Bad, I mean, if you can just stick out like a sore thumb and what, just because you're out of the Haight district in San Francisco, or some fucking place where it's like Long Beach. That's why I live there. You can go to the store in your fucking underwear and nobody gives a shit, you know. And it's like, you can't fucking, me and Chuck walked into this bowling alley in Salt Lake City and the whole fucking bowling alley stopped. It was so fucking white and inbreded, I couldn't believe, just milk and cookie land. I've never seen so many rosy cheeks. And what the hell, God damn is that. - I'd say what my work is about is to express the truth as far as, and I'm ever-searching and hanging on to that, the truth of being human. The truth of being human and within that human-ness, to be a bubble of light. I meditate and try to channel from my god, which is a god of creativity and love. That's my spiritual source And that's what I do, that's what I try to do when I'm performing live, recording, I get all my information from that source. And that's what I am. - I come from a working class, you do what you do, and get whatever reward you get when you get it. And you be happy with it. And know a lot of these millionaire rock stars running around, crybaby, I'm hurt, you know, with the model girlfriends, wrecking automobiles, getting in accidents, trying to find the heroin dealer. And they're just not happy, and it's like, why aren't they happy? It's because they don't know what really is going on. They just got caught up in all this shit and they went on this ride and as they were going along on the ride, they didn't take time to take a look at a lot of the things that were going on around them. - It's just one big, long look at, at egocentricity, about all the, just the bullshit around, and wanting to take this and pierce it right through it, and say, fuck, you know, fuck the makeup, fuck the veil, the curtain, get through it to the other side. 'Cause what's going on today, it's all just a pretty picture. And behind that pretty picture is a lot of fucking egocentricity, narcissism, and bullshit and lies. - [Voiceover] Liars. - A lot of lies. Everybody, you know, I sound really negative, but it pisses me off. - [Voiceover] I think that what the humor and the ability to point out, "Hey, this is fucked up in society." And be able to articulate that, in a fun, aggressive way, I think is needed again. I mean, you've got all these serious chick singers. And you've got all these rap artists who are talking about fucking chicks. And there's no humor any more. - [Keith] Well, it's not the flash life. The eight ball. - [Voiceover] And the eight ball. And the thing with the car and the bikini shaking the booty and it's like, "What the fuck is this?" I mean, there's no humor anymore. - And the thing is, it's not like that. If you go out into the real world, there's no girl dancing around, partially nude on the hood of my car. - [Voiceover] [laughs] - And I can't afford an eight ball. But I do hate the white man just as much as the next guy that comes along, just like I hate anybody in any organization, or any group of people, that will shoot their mouths off and not back it up, or go off and do something about it. - So I started aiming my spoken word stuff more and more as infotainment and voila, of all people, I wound up being Tipper Gore's pigeon for trying to send somebody to jail for the content of their music album. And then, all of a sudden, people who dismissed me as a paranoid lunatic two weeks earlier, were saying, "Wait a minute, the guy's right." And suddenly I had a platform for my ideas, a rare window opened in the straight mass media, to say this is how Tipper Gore's connected with Jerry Falwell, this is how she's connected with Phyllis Schlafly, and Pat Robertson, this is what they really want to do, this is why they want to ban records that mention homosexuality in them, and things like that. - [Voiceover] Is this when you did the Oprah Winfrey Show? - Yeah, that came a little later, yeah. - [Voiceover] A little later? - Yeah, and so, um, so what's happened with Spoken Word, is I made no pretense about being any kind of great literary artist or poet or writer. I just ram people with things I think they ought to know about, between the eyes, for about four hours a night. It's amazing only half the people leave. [laughter] - [Voiceover] I know that probably doesn't bother you. - And, no, but what it does, I mean, I miss the cathartic energy of the live music shows, of course, I mean, I still go to music shows all the time, write songs, record songs, et cetera. But with Spoken Word, the people who come there to listen, you can penetrate at a much deeper level, then with a two-minute punk song. You can go into a lot more detail. To the President of the United States, and all '98 election winners. Lungren, the Gray Davis man, wake up, get real, the way we're going in 2001 we'll be like Russia is now. Call off the drug war. [cheering and applause] - Oh, I'm proud to have been a part of it, and still be a part of it, because I think that it's a great thing, and I think that the LA punk rock movement was probably, maybe the second-greatest musical movement that's ever happened. I mean, I would liken it almost to the British Invasion. - People say, "Why have children "when the world is so fucked up?" And I say, "You pass on the things that you know" You teach your children the truth. They know the truth. Both of them do. They know, they're honest kids. When I drop out of the picture, they're going to go on, and they're going to go on with the spirit, with the punk spirit. - And that's what I think the difference, man. The old punks wouldn't let that shit go. A bouncer fucking takes a swing at a kid, you fuck him up. The cops come and they try to get one of your buddies, you fuck 'em up. You throw bottles, you do whatever it takes. If the club owner's a fuckhole, you burn his place down. - [Voiceover] So, your kids and your wife, you do you feel about your family, and how it affects your music? - Well, I love 'em, you know what I mean? It's like, I haven't been in jail nine years 'cause of them. Which is nice, yeah. I mean, I don't know, I try to teach my daughter to try to have some integrity, you know what I mean? To try to see past this shit, to be open. And it's cool 'cause the experience that I've had, it's like, I came from an abusive family. I've never laid a hand on my daughter. I've never hit my daughter, you know. I reason with her, I talk to her as an adult. And it's cool, it's like I go through a bunch of different hair colors, you know what I mean? I don't know, whatever, respect, or whatever it is. And I encourage her to not listen to people. I encourage her to not dress like the other kids at school. Don't follow that crap. Don't buy those shoes 'cause this guy's got shoes. Do what you want. - [Voiceover] Individuality in America is what it's based on. - Right, right. - Oh, there's always a possibility for something that scares the living daylights out of people to the degree that the Sex Pistols or whoever did, but I warn you, it may be you who gets scared. [laughter] What I can hardly wait for is when these pierced and tattooed parents have to deal with their rebellious children spending their allowance money on plastic surgery and having devil horn implants, elephant man faces, and designer tails. [laughter] How many older people who claim they still like punk, plug their ears when their 10-year-old kids put hip hop on? - We don't know if we're being liked, we have no statements, but I guarantee you we've never been on the radio, so I don't see anything real being really brought out to fucking candy-coated America. - Thomas Jefferson was a punk. Go read what he said. He said we should have a revolution every 100 years. Here was somebody that these kids are learning is supposed to be this great guy, and he's off saying this country needs to be shaken up, every 100 years let's have a revolution. - [Voiceover] Capsulize this whole movement, effective part, the punk rock movement, art, fashion, music, everything, and now it's evolved. What would you consider this whole thing [background noise] - Wow. [sighs] If I could do that, I'd probably wouldn't have gotten involved with it in the first place. I would have just said in a sentence then and stayed home. And had a life. ["Solitary War" by Gitane Demone] ["Spit Up the Rage" by Jack Grisham]
