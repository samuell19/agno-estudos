Hello! Hey, Paul. So you finally come in. Hurry up! I've already been working for an hour. You're always angry and in a rush. Nothing changes. KNOCK AND WAIT Hello, John! How do you do? Something new about Marguerite and Toni? Come in! Thank you so much. You're a smart boy. Thank you, goodbye! So you finally come in? -I couldn't get my lunch on time! -So that's it, eh? -Who is it? -Verona. Hello? Hey now! Come on! Why are you talking like that? There isn't any problem! Fine, whatever! Jesus, people can be so irritating! -So now, what are you waiting for? -For instructions! Didn't I tell you already? Maxim is waiting downstairs, go with him. -What about the suspect's car? -The police have it. Arrested or dead, it doesn't matter. Just please, hurry over there. I'm not your lap dog. You'll do whatever I tell you! Hello, Mike? How you feel? Say, about that call girl. Sad story, got something? Okay! Hurry up. We're out of time, man! There's always more time. Hello! Vera, Vera. Hello! Hi! Yeah, rearrange this. Here we go. Hurry up, we're losing time. So Vera, are you ready yet? You go with the others. Are you ready? Go! Go! Well, look at that! We're late because of you. Everything is over now. I am going to talk to the inspector. It turns out the witness was incorrect. Do you have anything? The suspect should already have been found. Anyway, no need to worry. He left his rain gear and license in the car. We have his photo and his identity. Where can he go? Is he someone we know? -An repeat offender? -No. Someone new. Someone by the name of Laurent Porte. -How do you spell that? -Porte. P - O - R - T - E. Ah, okay. He's a former paratrooper. He no doubt had trouble adjusting to civilian life. So, yes, a rather classic affair. Anyway, he was in a stolen car while he committed the crime. Now you've been fully briefed, ladies and gentlemen. Well, damn! We spent hours on this. What kind of job is this, eh? You look worried, man. What's the problem? Laurent Porte was my best friend. Oh, congratulations! What is he, then? A killer, a gangster? A gangster, now fuck off. Come on! Oh! What did they do to you? Stop it, Brigitte! -Where is a pharmacy? -A pharmacy? Oh, it's right over here. Just around the corner. Let's go, darling. -Sir, can you lay the child down? -Better call a doctor. Ladies and gentlemen, there's no assistance you can give. Go home. Out, please. Everybody out. Move. Ladies and gentlemen, move please. -What do you want from me? -I'm trying to help you. Let's not draw any more attention. Just try to talk about something and smile. -I don't want to talk. Leave me alone! -Just smile. Here we are, my home! Make yourself at home. Not bad, huh? Cheap and furnished, unfortunately. I always wanted to settle down but I'm still living the temporary life. Traveling most of the time, you know. Traveling will change your mind. Hey, how long has it been since we met last? Come and look. We've got an outstanding view right here. And the freedom to do whatever we want. So, old boy, what do you say? Don't just stand around. Feel free. No more risk now. Yeah, you'll be sleeping right here. This is a good bed. You'll be safe in this room. Paul, I gotta go. -Are you mad? -Look, I shouldn't be here. It's my problem, I shouldn't be around you! Oh, never mind. I'm just so happy to find you! It'll be fine. Don't worry, I've got you covered. Just a minute so I can check who called. Hello? This is Paul Frapier. Béthune 03-05, were there any messages? Okay. Okay. At eight o'clock at the drugstore. Yeah, that's right. Thank you. Actually, I forgot something. I had a date. I could cancel. No need! Don't let me disturb you. Before she gets here, her name is Vera. She's funny. It's our first date. I think she's in love with me. But she's terribly emotional. So no more wasting time, it's tonight or never. In the end, maybe her being emotional will do us good. Pardon! Pardon! Sorry I'm late. Come, for our first date, Paris is ours. Already up? Why don't you sleep some more? I need to go in early to the office. -Paul, I need to tell you something. -Not now, I'm in a hurry. I see you kept this. I'll come back as soon as I can and we'll have a serious talk, alright? By the way, the date yesterday went really well. I'll tell you about it later. Hello, beautiful! Morning, Mr. Paul. Did you sleep well? I did! Really well. Any messages? No, the post hasn't arrived yet. You know that I'd bring it to you if it had. I'll put it on your bed as usual. No, no. Don't bother. It's a mess in there right now. -No cleaning today. -You're kidding me. You mean, don't disturb your visitor. Whom? This house won't be safe if I hadn't noticed both of you yesterday. Well done! Yes, I have a sick friend and I brought him back. In fact, he was drunk. He's far from home, he can leave after a good sleep. -Let me give him some strong tea. -Leave him alone, damn it! Why are you leaving with the key? Don't you trust me anymore? Oh no, I am far safer with it in my pocket. Ciao! You're not ready yet? Hurry up! We're going to be late. What are you doing? I got to bed late last night and was trying to make a call. I can't hear you. Anyway, you're out of time. How wonderful! We could just walk there, couldn't we. Arabelle just called me, she'll be downstairs to pick us up. Speaking of Arabelle, she can't! She can't what? Something. Such a boring song. You're looking sloppy this morning. Maria, Paul brought me back this morning. Where are your bag and scarf? You know that you're silly, right? This boy is no better than the others. Especially now that he got what he wanted. But I love him! Idiot. Don't say that. Are you sure he feels the same? Hopefully. Can't you see it's ten o'clock? I'm ready! Remember what I said. Otherwise, he will break up with you. Easy… Shit! What the hell? You could have opened it. -Didn't know it was you! -Who did you think it was? No red wine can be spilled in this apartment, you know. -What's the problem? -Nothing. Hey, I know you. I can see it on your face. I didn't want to tell you yet, and it's nothing to be worried about. It's the receptionist. What's about her? I don't know how she saw you, but she knows there's someone here. She was reading the paper when I was on my way out this morning. Your photo was on the front. Do you think she'll call the police? I don't know. Hope not. But her husband's a cop. I'd better go. It's probably all in our heads, yeah, you never know. Right. Well, goodbye, Paul. Thank you. What? Thank you for your help. Letting me stay here and everything. But now you're leaving, yeah? And you think I'm just gonna let you go, eh? I'm gonna wish you a good trip? Tell me. Do you think I'd do that? Stay right there. Your clothes are recognizable. Take these. They'll do the job. This, too. A hat will mask your face. What's wrong? Put 'em on. Fast, eh? Paul, slow down. Please, give me one. Paul, listen. We didn't really have time to talk about it. I couldn't stop thinking about it all, you know? I think it would be better for me to surrender. Are you crazy? Don't be angry. I just know it's over for me. Come on! Don't say that. You've got some problems, but we're gonna figure them out. But you need to know this. I didn't want to kill him. And I couldn't guess whether the car had good breaks or not. It rained and the road wasn't good. -I did what I could, but… -No doubt! How are you going to explain that in court? No, listen. We'll solve it once you've gone away. And you'll be free. I just need to find some excuses on your behalf. Excuses! Do you trust me, yes or no? Hey, have some. -So many souvenirs back in day, eh? -Yeah! Here! Take one. Do you remember the day we stayed six hours in the jeep? I feel the pain all over again just remembering. Do you remember the big guy? Of course. Never shaved, always looking for a cigarette. He was constantly looking for people to shark at poker. -Likable guy. -Yeah. Oh and Portail! Portail? Yeah, the guy who was always hungry and asking for food! -What kind of guy? -Tall guy, blond. I don't really know. -Maybe. -Even if you don't remember him, I do! I remember everything, you know. Yeah you know, in life, there are times you can't remember everything. Childhood, college, military service… So many things have happened since then, you know. -Oh and the officer. -Which officer? Lause! Ahmed! -The guy who lived in Bab El-Oued. -Oh yeah, "roulé-boulé." Halt, Jean de La Porte! Puff out your chest like a strong man. Ready! Go. Go! Up! Go! Go! Up, go! What do you suppose happened to him? What, didn't you know? He's dead! This area is really pleasant. It's almost like you're on campaign. You'll see. Danny is a strong girl. A bit silly. Just what you need. You just need to handle her. You took your time! I was about to sleep. -What? You're gonna sleep without me? -You're foolish. -It's cold, come in. -I brought you a friend, by the way. -You should have told me! I'm half-naked. -Oh, he's used to it. Come on, man! -Just going to help yourself? -Yeah, of course! -This is Laurent. -This here is Denise Didanie. I want you to put him up two or three days. Are you crazy? When did I offer accommodation? And I don't want a man in my house. -Laurent is a brother. -Whose brother? I'm sure he's in trouble but I have a reputation. -Paul, I'd better leave. -No! You stay put. Let me talk to Dannie. -So. -Oh… So? Do you love me or not? Of course, but don't involve me in anything dirty. What are you thinking? Laurent and I were in Algeria together. -I'm here today because of him. -Yeah, right, you boys! -What? You don't trust me? -Stop it! That tickles. -Your friend is in the other room. -So, what? You're crazy. -Hello there! -Hello. Paul isn't here? He woke up early to check something at the office. -He didn't say anything about me? -He did. He said he'll be back tonight. Be careful, please. Don't draw attention. -You're going out as well? -I work in the center of Paris. Oh my, I'm going to be late. See you! See you. How are you, Mr. Paul? Didn't sleep here last night? What about your sick friend? You can leave a sick man? -He was fine, so he left. -Left? When? What? Didn't you see us going out yesterday? -No! -Oh, bravo! What secure premises. Damn you! -No messages for me? -Messages? Oh, there was. This is it. An urgent summons from the police. Police Prefecture! CONTROL FILES -What's the hold up? I need to go to work! -You'll be called in a moment. Help yourself. Name and surname, please. Frapier. Paul Frapier. Date and place of birth? April 9th, 1935, Paris. Address and Profession? Twenty-eight, Quai de Béthune Street. Reporter-photographer. Have you known Laurent Porte for a long while? Who? No, can't say that I know him. Weren't you in charge of his photography section at Ménilmontant? Yeah, of course! But you haven't caught him, so… And you haven't seen him since then? Me? Why would I? It was just work. Bring it. Here's what we've found in your house. This is Laurent Porte's suit. One of our agents identified it. So, how can you explain this? How do I know! This type of suit is common, you know. And you entered my room! Did you have a warrant? This could all be a set up by you people. Right, all these things happened without me being present. Nothing proves that it isn't you lot making things up! Thank you. That's all. Really? Can I leave? Yeah! You're free for now. Hello! Yeah, it is. Yes, she's here. Please hold, I'll put her on. -Dannie, it's for you. -I'm coming. I'll take care of it. Hello? Paul, it's you? Will you pick me up? What? You're kidding me! You can't leave me alone with that guy around! No, I am not angry but… Oh, suddenly you have work in Bordeaux. I need you here. I'm telling you I can't. It's not my fault! It'll be too risky. What? Too risky for my career. I just said I am working! Oh, hell. -Hey, are you going tonight, too? -No, Pradier will replace me. -Too bad. We could have gone together. -Yeah, you know, traveling all the time. Paul, in a hurry? It's down 24 points in New York. Haut-Katanga Province, minus four thousand. This won't work. It's impossible. I said no. You have to sell immediately. So, Pilleuve. Why not debut right now? That's too soon. We're still planning it out. -We're looking for a big moment. -Ah, of course. You deserve it. Thank you. -We're looking everywhere. -Nobody knows how to deal with it. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll figure it out. It's him. No, that's bullshit. I know what you need. -You know Cocteau's story? -No. Which train would you prefer? The train that arrives first but no one talks about? Or the one that has an accident and is covered by all the newspapers? -Being on the front page is best! -You're right. She could have an accident but in the splendid way, so that other woman won't seem as special anymore. He's right. We already have beautiful girls, comediennes. Try something different. I like that already. It could even be something forbidden to minors. Oh, no. Come on, we can't survive bankruptcy! Your photos need to be more attractive to stimulate men. And girls should be jealous about all these men that are waiting on her lists. -That's all supposition, obviously. -Of course. Hello, darling. How are you? Will you excuse me? Hope to see you again soon. I want to connect the dots on these ideas. I'm all alone. Isn't that what you want? What's wrong? I thought we should be together, yesterday. -You could have called me or something. -Oh, I was busy yesterday. Not even a few minutes for a call? Excuse me for a sec. Can you believe that? What could have kept him so busy? I need to talk to you, Stéphane. A moment, please. People are saying this film will be good. Maybe! But I hear the talent is crazy and the manager is always drunk. Anything is possible. I want a favour. Okay, but my family and I aren't doing so great, and… It's not about money, man. So, what do you want? The report on the Spanish anarchist. Is that you? It is. It made some noise, eh? I need you to help me find a partner. A partner? For what? To move to Spain. Boy, you must have done something bad. And no need to deny it. I warned you last time. Do you know that you can be killed? It's okay. I know you. Drink, eat, sleep… Films on Saturday night and then sex. Is helping a criminal evade police a preferable lifestyle? -Fuck to the police. -Hey, don't talk like that. -There are people out here. -So what? Freedom of speech. -Gentlemen! -Not worries. I didn't ask for a sermon. I need a partner. Yes or no? Do you think I do have one in my pocket? Alright, got it. No friends in hard times, eh! It's better than last time. Yes, but there is no champagne. Excuse me, please. About this project, will you be able to make it? Which project? -For my debut. -Ah! Why not? It's all about the mood. If we could understand each other. You know, Paul. Whenever I want something, I ended up getting it. I have the ambition and I also have the will. And I always pay the price needed. My friend has a lot of money and he's ready to… Oh, no. I am not inspired by money. Money or… We can always find a way. Ah! If it's about feelings. We need to talk seriously but there are too many people here. Let's get together to talk another time. Possibly. Oh! You scared me. Why are you sitting in the dark? Let me close everything. -All right! Now we're good. -Paul isn't with you? Ah, that guy! -You can't count on him. -Why? He won't come? He doesn't have time. But feel safe. You can still count on me because I know. Paul told me everything. -What did he say exactly? -Everything. About the guy who wants to kill you because you took his wife. -Because I took his wife? -It's not my story. Ah, right. That guy, yes. I know you're a secretive type, but with me you don't have to be. -It sounds like you saved his life, too. -Whose? Or not, right! Ah, Paul! Aw, we just try to look out for each other during hard times. And that's normal. If you want something, you can do everything right? So, Paul did not say anything about when he would be back? Whenever he wants. That's how he do things. He'll do it all when he needs you. And then when it's over… He's damn crazy. But one day, he will learn his lesson. I'm a decent girl, from a good family. -So, he didn't say anything about me? -Nope! Me and you, we're not such a big deal for him. That's a fact, or at least the way he thinks. We'll have dinner together, okay? It's not the end of the world. Let's be positive. -Hello! -Nice to see you. So, you're good now? Not mad anymore? I am never mad at my real friends. Oh, great. That means I am a good one. -I've found your thing. -Which thing? What you were asking me for last time, about the trip. -Really? -Don't doubt me. -Yeah, you're a good friend. -Look, I'm just gonna introduce you and you see yourself through. But it's gonna cost you a lot. Never mind, I would sell my car if need be. Okay. You'll meet in my place, with my backing. He's available every night from nine to eleven at Café Curieux. -This place is good, eh? -Do you really like it? I like a change sometimes. -And you do really like change? -It's part of my job, you know. -Here today, gone the next. -That's good for you. I would really like to escape with you one day. Oh, it's not for women! This is great, right? Just kiss me. Done! Now we've done with formality. I don't really like to act this way in public, you know. Oh, girls! But can't you just talk to me as Vera instead of just putting us together? Oh, gosh! You don't worry that I could fall for you? Look, it's not the right time. With you, it's never the right time to talk about serious things, is it? It depends on what you call ”serious.” You mean love? I know it's wrong to always speak about my love for you… but you do believe me, right? I do and I don't, Vera. What does that mean? Well, that you can be honest and say that you love me but deep inside you, maybe you don't know. We never really know. I love you, you love me. You're my only one! Then what? So what should I do? I give you everything but you don't care. I offer you my whole life. So, what do you from me? Let's go and have a drink. What would you like, sir? -A Martinique. -Two. -Let me see your palm. -Why? -Just to know you better. -That's dangerous, you know. Show me. You have a long life line, you know! -You'll have a long life. -That's good, right? But your heart line isn't good. Oh, really. Are you sure? Double, triple lines, all broken! An overactive heart! That's why I'm generous with everyone. -Let me see the other one. -What? Are they not the same? Not all! Give me a second. -Hello. -Hello Gaston, how are you? When do I get my chance? Hello! This is too complicated. Can you please try to understand? I need some answers. -That's what I'm saying. -I am sorry, but… Please listen to me carefully. We're not strong people. We're weak people, that's why we're fighting. -If it is for the fight, yes! If not… -So, what should I do? You should talk to your friend. I'll tell him but it's gonna cost you. And then it'll all be okay. So what are you saying I should do? -Three hundred or four hundred… -What? Really? You ask for my opinion. And we do all this for the greater good. -Where's my girl? -She left. -Our bill? -Nine francs. What are you doing? What's wrong? Why did you leave? What happened? -Please answer me! -You're playing with me, right? Come on. Never! Where did you go? I just needed to talk to that guy. Nothing too important. It was about a friend of mine. You're so kind. That's the truth. You're so very kind. Do you love me? How do I know that? Whenever a man sees a beautiful girl, he wants to be with her. That's what it is. With Paul you'll never know. His own pleasure, it's all for him. But he doesn't have to worry, you're in my house. and you're not so bad! No. I'm grateful but… Oh! Let's dance. Shall we dance? Let's dance and enjoy. -You probably know how to dance. -Oh, not at all! Sure, sure. For someone who doesn't know how to dance. You're doing great! I like dancing with you. I love it. No! -Paul. -Paul? Do you think he avoids a girl that he wants? Come on! No! No! Not yet! You're crazy. Wow! You're in a hurry. Let me get undressed. Go away. I will call you later. I love you, you know. I really do. Don't you believe me? This is the proof. I'll be right with you. You're listening to Radio Luxembourg, Jaques Garnier speaking. Here's a song called "You Too", requested by Robert Alberti for his wife, Denise, Hubert Legeai, military postman… Laurent! Richard for Moumoute and Raymond Merchèze… Laurent! For Evelyne, in Bourges. Where are you, Laurent? Who opened the door? Where are you, Laurent? KILLER DRIVER ESCAPES FROM THE POLICE Dear God, how sublime this girl, your creation! -What's the car? Did you get a new one? -Yeah, got one from a friend. -Mine was trouble. -For whom? For your reputation. May I come in? What a dress, girl! You must be waiting for someone. -You inspire me. -Oh, now you remember my existence? -Laurent is here? -That's all it is with you, Laurent! No, he's not here. And that's for good. Don't waste your time. He's gone. -He left? -Without a word. No farewell and not even a thank you. -When? -I haven't counted the days since he left. Maybe two or three days? What really happened? Just tell me. -Did you have a fight? -Of course you think it's my fault. No, look, I need to find him. He has no money, no identification. Report it. Or can't you because the police are looking for him? My God, this crazy girl! I gave you a friend of mine, down on his luck, and you can even take care of him? Oh, now you're shouting. You think I'm without complaints? -Like what? -Your friend killed a cop. And you want me to take care of him without telling a thing? Right, so simple, Dannie will do the job. -Oh, now look-- -You thought I would never know, right? You always thought I was a fool. Anyway, I'm not angry. But this thing between you and me? It's over. Do me a favour and leave my house and never come back again. -Understand? -No, Dannie, listen. You're mad at me. You're wrong, I'm not just angry. I made up my mind. And we're through. Through! Oh, man. It took so long to find you. And I thought I was about to do the same thing tonight. -Evening, Vera. -Hello. -What do you want? -Hey, I've worked it out for 850. You bring the car tomorrow morning. I've found a buyer that's ready to pay 100 upfront. I changed my mind. -What? -I'll keep my car. You're kidding me, right? Don't you remember yesterday? You were begging. You said you needed the money before going to Bogotá tomorrow morning. -You're leaving? -Yeah, that's my job, you know. Paul, listen. I've done my best for you. And I'd do it again, too. But I need you to at least be thankful. Fuck you. Don't joke with me or you'll be in trouble. Are you crazy, Paul? You should be ashamed of yourself. For what? For your behaviour! You're drunk and throwing punches like a criminal or something. Why didn't you tell me that you need money? I don't ask girls for money. Girls! That's what I am for you, a girl? Then go to your girls tonight! Vera! Come on, I'll bring you home! Oh, fantastic. See you next time. How does this thing work? Yeah, here it is. Hello? Hello. Hello! Ah. Hello, Arabelle! Hello! It's me. -Who is it? -It's me, Paul. -Paul? -Paul! Paul Frapier. You're insane, it's 3:00 a.m. What's that to bourgeois people like ourselves! What do you want? Just to talk, discuss, go over things. Stop shouting. You'll awake the neighborhood. Let them wake up. We're artists and we're always causing scandals! Shh! Paul, listen. I'm gonna open the door on one condition. Be quiet, okay? -You promise? -Okay, baby! Oh, I'm coming! How are you? Don't think that your audacity surprises me, Paul. Your home is nice. A bit small. This is not the right time for visiting. Make your choice. Sleep peacefully or be famous! I'm not in the mood for jokes. You want me to be serious, then? To speak about great things, feelings. Like you're the only one and I love you? That you're the only one for me. And I'm sad. You want me to say that I'm hopeless and your love will make me happy again, eh? That's it right? Is that good enough? -It doesn't matter, you're drunk. -Yeah, you're right and I need a scotch. Scotch? There's always a price to be paid, right baby? Paul, please swear that after your drink you'll go home. No ice. Never ice. I've been working all day long. Some prep for my movie. I really need to sleep, please. -You've got a bathroom? -Of course, right there. -Shower? -What? No, a bathtub. Paul, What are you doing? I'm going to take a bath after my drink. You're asking yourself whether you're gonna kick me out or not, uh! Something that will not be easy for you to do. Because you want to be famous. You wanna be a movie star. You want people to see you on the front page of the magazines. You want everyone to know your name. Why not? I need it one more time! That's right, baby. But nothing is easy. You have to be magic. You need to build a picture in their minds. You have to work on your personality, grab their attention, be in their hearts. And I notice your friend is ready to commit. Of course, he has confidence in my personality. So, what's the deal? You'll also earn big money from the box office. You'll encounter huge personalities with love stories. You can do interviews and be difficult. You can say that you love solitude and meditation. You have to let people know that you're an unavailable queen. But a queen that is waiting for love and happiness. Got eggs? Eggs? -Yeah! -Paul, what now? I'm hungry! I'd like eggs or chicken. After. After what? -After, we make love! -What? -Out of the question. -Why out of the question? Tell me. Such a beautiful girl, my favorite. So what's the problem? Paul, you're wrong. I'm not one of your… -Come on, let's go! -Paul, Paul! Come on. You're drunk. -This is unacceptable. -Aw, why? -Sorry, the bathtub is spilling. -So let's hurry. Paul, this isn't right. My life is already full. How can we see each other? That's not important. We'll plan later, tomorrow. Paul is missing. -He'll be back this morning. -That so? Vera, you know. I'd like to be honest with you. It involves your happiness and future. And anyway, I don't want you to be worried. Stay still now. Just a small, light smile please. Good. Ready! There we go. Thank you. It's perfect. -Let's change hats. -Alright, quickly please. You agree, Arlette? -You were saying? -It's about Paul. Not a big deal, though. Don't worry. What's wrong with Paul? Listen, darling. We used to talk honestly together, right? You do know that men in Paris are ready to do whatever it takes to have me. -I do not look at your men! -What do you mean? -That you and Paul? -No. Don't misunderstand. Paul came into my house in the evening. No, late at night. -Why? For what reason? -Do I really know? You know that he's always looking for girls, right? Me, I didn't give him any encouragement. You have my word. But he was really aggressive and I couldn't get away from him. Now, now! What's the problem, girls? You can talk about things later on! Please, we're working! I need you to be serious. Don't move! Hey, what are you doing? I need light, kid! Oh! Why do I have to work like this? I'm not going to play the victim or lie to you. And Paul isn't a child. I hope that I'm not hurting you by being truthful. I don't wanna be a bad friend but let's be honest, you need to leave him. He's a small-minded guy, trust me. He doesn't deserve you. Honestly, I'm happy. Because I am sure that after this there will be something better for you. Quiet! Are you ready, girls? Let's get started now. Smile! Eyes! What's wrong with you, Vera. We're waiting just for you! Let's go with a pretty smile. There we go. A little bit more, that's it. Perfect, Vera! Don't move! Let's get it. Excellent! Hey, stop! Daniel, you're going to the office, right? Please bring this and tell them I'll be there in the afternoon. -Okay! -Ciao. So, didn't you see me? I just drove straight from the airport after I landed. So, let's eat something. -No. -Oh, what's wrong? You still think about last night? Oh, listen, I was drunk, a lot on my mind. Don't be mad at me. Arabelle. What about Arabelle? I know, Paul. She told me everything. Oh, that bitch! Of course she did. So this is about girl-talk, eh? -All right! Just be proud of me. -How could you laugh? How? What? Because I slept with another girl? We're not married! You're just mad because she told you. Come on. Let's go. God, Paul. You must really despise me. Oh, big words! Anyway, never mind then. We don't do charity here. Contact the gendarmerie. We barely have enough ourselves with all you homeless people around. Life is hard for all of us. I wanna sell this. No! I don't buy things this way. I don't want trouble. I need money, man. Let's me see it. See, it's brand new and working. How much for it? Just give me what you can. It's morning and I don't have much money in the register. And I don't really want this type of transaction. Anyway, just this once. I'll give you five thousand francs. And of course with the old currency. -Five thousand? -Take it or leave it! Fine. -And cheese. -Okay. -Can I make a call? -Where? -Paris. -Go ahead. Hello, please give me room 46. Hey, Vera, it's me Paul. Did you just call? I was in the shower. Ah, hello Maya! Can I talk to Vera? Ah, she is getting dressed. Okay, just tell her that I'm gonna pick her up for lunch. Why? What are talking about? She's sick? What? But why? Hello? Maya? Can you hear me? What's going on? Honestly, is she in trouble? Oh, I'm gonna be there in a minute. Can I see her? Paul! Vera! Maya, what happened? When I got in yesterday I saw light in the room. I knocked on the door. No response. The door was locked from inside. Fortunately, the night guard had his master key. We found her unconscious in the room. -Why did you do such thing? -You're nuts if you really don't know! Maya! When you left last time, I thought… -I'm a fool. -Yeah, you're right! Please! You'd prefer I leave? Call me if you need me. You can make a call, right? Don't bother getting up. Don't be mad at her. -I'm mad at myself. -No, don't be. I made some bad choices. But… At the same time, you should know what you really mean to me! Arabelle means nothing. She's nothing for me. And you took this stupid thing? Suicide doesn't deal with anything. That's crazy, it's a crime! Don't kill yourself. Paul! Sorry for shouting. You're tired and you need to rest. No, keep doing it. It means you love me. Didn't you know that? I knew that you want me but… I knew you liked other girls, too. You never said that you love me. You didn't explain anything, either. You were always looking around. Okay, let me explain everything. No, Paul. I don't want you to feel compelled. You need to know. I can't keep this secret to myself anymore. I have a friend, a good one. Hello! Should I open the door? Please don't. Are you crying? I'm just happy. Me, too. But I'm ashamed, you know. You did everything you could. No, I don't think so. That's too simple an excuse. Paul! Where are you? I am right here. Your room is wonderful. Or perhaps it's horrible. Yeah, it's me! What? What’s the meaning of all this? Is it a joke? What am I doing here? -Come on, don't be mad. Let's go! You assisted a criminal. And I'm okay with that. I don't approve of how you did it… but I understand why. Is Porte one of your friend? From Algeria? Yeah, I did my research. Why didn't you arrest me? We're not done yet! Take a look. There, the cabin on the mountaintop. He's there. -Laurent? -Yes. We caught up with him, told him to surrender and he shot at us. No. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. So, he can't go anywhere. But I'm uneasy with all these police. All these people against one man. Feels like an unfair fight. Being a police officer isn't doing battle or being a hero. -This is real life. -So what do you want from me? You're the one that can help him. Me? How? All I can say to him is, ”Surrender, this is your last chance.” You see what I mean? I can't even approach him because he'll shoot at me. But you can try it out. Take your time and think about it. I'll give you the opportunity to talk with him… or never talk again. Because I'm getting angry. Laurent. Laurent. Laurent. It's Paul. Laurent. It's Paul. Laurent. It's me, man. -It's too late. -No! I'm here. I'm thirsty. You're thirsty? Wait a second. No risk now. Wait for me. So, has he decided? Can we move in? I need bread, wine, sausage, cigarettes… and two hours. -Is that possible? -Yes. Go and get what he needs. Two hours and four minutes, we'll say. When your time has gone, the plan changes, understood? Yeah. Did he shoot at you? No. I know the sound, even from a distance. No, sir. He didn't shoot. Not bad, eh? Eat. Easy man. Let me join you. You're mad at me, yeah? Maybe you think that you're here because of me. I send you to Orly and… No. -Why didn't you return to Dannie's? -It's the police, man. They've been following me all around. And I was afraid to go back there. I was also afraid. -I thought you'd forgotten me. -That's crazy. No. That's my fault. Call him back. It's strange finding you again. You're not the same person in Paris. Why? You were kind, trying to help me. You gave me some money. -But… -But what? I wanted you to understand me. But I couldn't make you. I wasn't cool. There you were sleeping around, making money, doing deals… with all your tricks. All of that was fake, you know. Not really something serious. What matters is that we're still friends, right? You once told me that friendship is fake. That people only look out for their own interests. Come on! You didn't believe that, did you? All this is for you, not for the bigger picture! Time is up? Which time are you talking about? Oh, come on! I know that I can't go anywhere, and you only came up here with their permission. Listen! Time's up. Make your decision if you wanna surrender. I promise you, I will come to visit. I'll get the best lawyer, find you help and take care of everything. If you don't, then we can change our clothes. There's a chance. No, let's end all this. I'm tired. And I'm in. Go and tell them. We'll get out of this, you know. Thank you. Laurent! I thought you'd want this. THE END Subtitle translation by: Chris Ndoda
