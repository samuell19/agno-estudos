In Kano, an Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba man got arrested... for being drunk and disorderly on the street... on a holy Friday. Now, after the were sober... they were brought before the Emir... and the Emir's judgement was that... they each receive twelve lashes of the cane... as punishment... Here... protocols on detention and release. OK. I noticed you have a detainee that has been here for three months... a Mister Jolomi Johnson. Oh, Jonjo! You see his case is different. Why hasn't he be transferred to the maximum security prison... in the mean time? Because, I believe he is Innocent. The Hausa man said wait Please... I will like you to tie one pillow... to my back. One pillow. At the thenth strike... the pillow burst. The hausa man cried... he cried like a baby... from the fierce pain... he received from the last two lashes. Dolapo... you are the first... female to be appointed as commander of... incharge of Area F... and then quite young too. Well... I am honoured that the IG has placed such confidence in me. Of course... you are the new breed of police officers... you know... with post graduate degree in international law.

I will tell you this... and for free. Nothing Dolapo... and I mean absolutely nothing... beats... good old guts instinct... and that my dear comes with experience. Whao... Thank you. Enough reading materials for the night. Oh... tomorrow... I would finish my handing over notes and after that... the whole of Area F... will be yours. Thank you sir. And the Yoruba man stepped forward... and confessed to the Emir that... It was he who influenced the Hausa and Igbo man to drink... So therefore, he deserves hundred lashes. Good night Sir. Good night Dolapo. Er... Dolapo please... Er... Send in the duty sergeant on your way out please. What a ride The Emir asked " Are you insane?" What! Are you insane? A Hundred lashes will kill you... but, the Yoruba man insisted... …so therefore… the Emir therefore said okay! No problem. How many pillows do you want tied on your back? Do you know what the Yoruba man said? What did he say? He said no pillows at all Sir! Just tie the Igbo man on my back... Attention! Officer on ground! Salute! You... rank and name? ASP Dare Oni Sir!..Ma This is the Area Police Command, not a Beer Parlour... I will expect more from an officer with your rank. Sorry Ma! It's a pity. Ibrahim...

Please. Yes, I... I wanted to... take a shortcut into Toyin street, so I made... a detour at... through... Maria. Why a shortcut that late? Why would you take a shortcut at that time of the night? I wanted to avoid the long queue... at the checkpoint on Allen. What time exactly was this? 10:30, thereabout… Yes? Go on darling... you are doing well. When I was driving along...

Wait, wait, wait When I refused to come out of my car... one of them smashed my side window... …I panicked… …and I hit the accelerator and I lost control… and I hit a lamp post.

I was afraid for my life, I pleaded for my life. I told them I have money... in the glove compartment. They took the money... my phone, my watch... my wedding ring. Ugh... Go on And they wanted to take the car... but, they couldn't find the key. The one who had only one shoe... he advised the others to kill me... but they decided not to. They warned me to stay quiet and... …they just left me on the ground. Eh I thought they... I thought they were going to kill me uh-oh... am so sorry... …it's okay darling… you are safe now.

Ok Sir. Although retired now, Bamishaye was the Chairman... of the senate committee on police affairs. We take care of our own. Absolutely Sir. Well… Uh... 38 years of service? Yes Sir. Happy retirement Joseph. Thank you sir. - Dolapo… - Sir. - Are they treating you well here? - Yes they are. Are you sure? Yes Sir. Okay, no problem. Ibrahim… how are you doing? I am fine Sir. - Everything is fine? - Yes sir. - Ah, Chukwuka… - Sir! - How about your wife? - Good sir. And you? - God is Great! - OK. Hey! Hey!! What's the problem? Who is making noise there? Boss, has my plasma TV arrived? Yes, we are clearing it through customs. Good man! What about me? You too, you want plasma? My lawyer, damn it! Your lawyer? Doesn't your lawyer sleep? I've been making requests... …to contact him since last night! Did you know… I've got human rights? In this Nigeria? It's ok... …just continue to speak as if you know everything. Look, let me advice you… …a lot of big professors have slept in this same cell… If you are sensible as you claim... you would sit down and sleep. Idiot!! Move away. You thief. Nnamdi, what were you doing... loitering around Isaac John... where my men arrested you last night? I was looking for petrol to buy. At 1am?! Black Market At 1am? I have a very irritable and pregnant wife… We had just returned from our trip to Ghana. Now, wait wait, … rewind… uh? …to activities leading to the early hours of yesterday… … at the beginning of slavery, they were having 400… …ladies that were in all the rooms that we have down here. Now at that time it was only the men who were travelling to explore Africa. And as a result of that... they were sexually abusing the ladies. It was a good breakaway from the norm... …but the trip had brought home some stark realities to me. It got me feeling sad and depressed for our country… So, … you were saying, Out of fuel. I thought you bought some earlier. It skipped my mind. Nnamdi! …It's almost midnight, there's no filling station… open at this time of the night. Near... Oba Akinjobi there's... …there's a guy who sells black market. And what does he mix with it? Palm wine? Leave it till morning So... I went out last night looking for petrol to buy. Bro... please where is Messi? Lionel Messi... some man here is looking for you. Messi, Please... do you have petrol? At this time of the night? Alright… thanks. With no petrol, I decided to head back home. I was about five minutes... five minutes away from my flat... when I was arrested by the police. Okay, Well, I'll send a police unit to her this morning. But you do have proof though that you were in Ghana? Like passport and ticket stubs, … that wouldn't be your problem right? Hey, My friend! That wouldn't be a problem, would it? I was careless. Oh… We had our passports, tickets and other documents in it. That's like, very convenient... very very convenient... …in other words, you do not have… any proof that you were in Ghana... uh? Okay Wait, wait. I do, I do, I do. I do..I do... there was a man on the flight... …a Mister Daniel, an advertising executive… Hello again... …how's your little girl doing? We were on the same flight…. …was your daughter not the girl who shouted NEPA when the cabin lights were dimmed? Oh yes, yes... she's in the rest room with her mother. Okay That young girl of yours is going... to be a big star someday. Thank you, everybody says so. How old is she? - She's two. - WOW! Going on twenty. My name is Tobi Daniels... and I am an Advertising Executive... with Noah's Ark. We are shooting series of campaign for clients that… will air accross Africa. Alright Here's my card. Ok. So when you are settled, I'd love for you to give me a call. I believe we can use your daughter for a major campaign that we have. - Mr. who? - Mr. Daniel. Uhum… If you check my pock- My friend... sit down. It's in my wallet that you confiscated. If you check him, you'll confirm that I was on that flight with him. What time did you get home from the Airport? About 7pm. 7pm? The robbery took place between 11 and midnight. So your arrival from Accra is irrelevant. Why would I return from a family vacation and then randomly rob someone? Mr. Nnamdi Okafor. Now... which one of these men... is your gang leader? - Gang- - My Friend, look… at the pictures. Hmm? And tell me… Eeny, … meeny, … miny moe… which one of them is your gang leader? I don't belong to any gang. Are you sure? I don't know this men... Emomotimi Jomo. Jomoh! You have here a Yenogua address from Bayelsa? I don't have a Lagos address, that's where I come from. Bayelsa. So you ran out of target in Bayelsa to rob and decided to come to Lagos, yeah? Hey officer, Look at me very well. You will know I am not an armed robber. Excuse me! If we are not mistaken, that's a bullet wound on your right leg. Ah, this one? Uhum. My friend, we have… …a dispensary here at the police station. Do you want treatment? Officer, I am fine. Are you sure? He said he's fine. Sir! Ok. Emomotimi... Jomo. Sir You are a long way from home. I am not aware that I need a Visa to come Lagos now. I was walking down the road when I was arrested. When did you get here? Just yesterday. What's your business in Lagos? Officer. I am a tourist... here on sightseeing. What's your occupation? My occupation? Yes. Looking for a job now. You are presently unemployed... yet you are tourist? I needed a break, from not having a job. - Are you mad? - Officer, what is all this about? - Do you think we are here to joke? - What did I do? I will slap the yellow off your face! Because you wearing a suit, you think you can threaten me? Inspector! That's enough. Inspector Abacha! That's enough. Sir. And you... …sit down. Look here! If you prise me you will pay! I am a fearless, I am a Bayelsa boy. I eat boys like you for breakfast. Then I will be your last breakfast! You! I said… Officer, put your dog on the leash. Look at me! Look at me!! Now why don't you tell me… …what your business really is in Lagos? Officer, it was just some days ago… I was out job hunting, in Yenogoa... Officer, I finished my National Diploma many years ago! But still, no work. No job. Many years of neglect and frustration has left the creek a dark shadow of it's self. I knew I had to get out, before I get swallowed by the rot. But to get out officer, I needed money. To get money, I needed a job. I never knew I was blocking their getaway car. It felt like a mosquito bite at first, then I look down, I saw blood, blood everywhere. That's the very first time I feel the pain! Next thing I know, I find myself in a hospital. Some doctor attempting to remove a bullet from my leg! With my eyes wide open, without an anaesthetic! Eh… Oh sorry... …but we're still waiting to hea what brought you to Lagos. The Doctor said the bullet was lodged in very deep. Taking it out was just too dangerous. Two days out of the hospital, an infection set in. I was told I could lose my leg, so I got a referral to a Doctor in Lagos. That's what brought me to Lagos. So what were you doing in Ikeja? Looking for a hotel. Someone on the bus mentioned the Savoy Hotel. The Savoy Hotel, near the hospital is where I'm doing my operation, on Isaac John. What's the name of the hospital? Eh… Holy Bethel, Holy Bethel hospital. And the doctor? One Dr. Ogunbamise. He was expecting me at 12 o'clock today- OK, Let's go back to yesterday. What time did your bus get in to Lagos and where? Jibowu park, at around 9pm. 9 pm? So what were you doing between the hours of 9 and 2am in the morning? Emomotimi Jomoh! Conductor, what's happening? Why is this fool still awake… …when the rest are sleeping? What's going on? It baffles me. I uttered the same incantations that put the others to sleep. Ok, let's give him some time. Ok, boss. Officer, I don't understand Yoruba, but somehow I knew they were talking about me. You see, if one passenger had dozed off, I could have bought it. Or even two Sir. But all six! I knew something was wrong. Hey driver, conductor, - I want to drop here! - Mister I thought you said you are dropping off in Ikeja? I said drop me here. We can't stop on the road. Drop me here. We are not Ikeja yet. Driver, I said I want to drop here! Drop me here! What's he saying? - He said he wants to drop? - On the main road! What shall we do? - Repeat the incantations. - Okay. "Incantations" Oh, oh, oh, you want to kidnap me? What are you saying? Is it me you want to kidnap? I said drop me here! Hey, hey, hey! - Do you want to kill us? - Stop the bus! Stop this bus! Stop the bus! Stop this bus! This one is a mad man!!! You expect us to believe that story? Officer, I expect you to belive that a man who is not capable of walking, is not a likely candidate for an armed robber! Who are these people? Officer, I don't know them. My friend... look at the pictures. Look at the pictures again... and tell me who this people are. My friend, listen to me... …I do not know the kind of… interrogation methods that you were used to at Headquarters, but right here, in this station, I do not condone… …physical abuse on my suspects! - He was out of order- - You, were out of order! Apology sir. We'll recommence after lunch. Ma'am, hold it, please. Er… We may have a problem. Are you really going through with this charade? Never forget your place, Rayo! I'm just looking out for my father. Your father is looking out for me. Okay, look. I don't think he deserves for you to make a complete fool of him. Really? Why don't you go ahead and advise him so? Maybe I will! Yeah. Good luck with that. …we should make it there in another 30mins. The suspects' fingerprints reports just came back from Abuja HQ. Yes. All clean, no previous records. Hmm. Interesting. Senator and Mrs. Bamisaiye should be here shortly, I'll let you know once they arrive. Thank you Dolapo. This is unacceptable! They just can't keep me locked up like this! I want my lawyer! I want my lawyer now! Listen man... …call him. Why don't you call him? Guy! Cool down, cool down. I'm a banker, I'm not a criminal! I thought all bankers were criminals. You're the criminal, look at you! Don't judge a pastor by the white garment. I'm innocent! She sells recharge cards opposite my house at lyana-Ipaja. We have been flirting with each other for a while. Ahh. Ahh… ahh… Aargh... Blessing... Blessing... aargh ...My God... I am done... Blessing... …Blessing! This girl, you have killed me! She could have told her mother that we were dating… …that I was her man, …and that the sex was consensual. But she didn't. You have finished me! Mama, he forced me! What? Aargh? I've been here for thirteen weeks now… …thirteen weeks! Jonjo! - Yes. - Come and empty your shit bucket. - Corporal! - Jonjo! Corporal, mission accomplished. Jonjo, stop here! Drop the bucket. Madam wants to see you. Jolomi Johnson. Madam, my friends call me Jonjo. Sorry, Jonjo. Do you know who I am? Madam at the top, new Area Commander, from tomorrow. And as from tomorrow, I'll be in a position to make your rape case… …disappear. Madam! However, if I'm to scratch your back, you have to scratch mine. Ha, Madam… …I will scratch everywhere. I will scratch everything, Madam. I'm going to place four robbery suspects in your cell. Yes, Yes Mam… And here is what I want you to do... Yes Mam. I'm an artist. I draw and paint landscapes on canvas. Where did you learn your skill? I'm a HND… …Fine Art uh… …Fine Art grad- undergraduate at... …Kaduna Polytechnic. Our lecturers have been on a strike for over three months now, sir. A jobless student? Ugh! You look like a poster boy for Boko Haram to me! You have a Lagos Makoko address? Yes sir, uhm… …I'm temporarily residing with a family friend there. I arrived two months ago. I never had no idea that such a slum existed in Lagos. A whole community built on stilts on top of the lagoon. There was a communal spirit, …a sense of belonging, …a feeling of joy that that pervaded the tattered looking faces of the inhabitants. I had to capture it on canvas. …and then I decided to use low cut on him because I'm tired of the braiding, braiding, braiding. Thank you sir. …you can take a look at the other beautiful ones too. Excuse me sir. Though I'm a poor student… …yet I sold that painting for one hundred and fifty thousand naira. What happened to the car? - Overheating! - What!! As I watched the hot steam rise out of the car's engine, My thoughts picked up strands of conversation I had heard… …in passing back in Makoko… …that the worst place for any car to break down… …in the middle of the night is third mainland bridge. Are you sure you don't need help? I don't need help. This is a dead car. Hassan! Hassan, Run. run! run!! run!!! I don't need help! I don't need help… Someone, please! Help... help, help... help I thank God for his mercies. Or for your stupid imagination! Go on... For my safety, I decided to pass the night at a hotel at Ikeja. What hotel were you heading to? Savoy! Savoy? The one on Isaac John? These your friends? Which of them is your gang leader? Friends? Gang leader? - Sir, I don't know any one of them- - My friend Look at the pictures. Look at the pictures very well! Now tell me, which one of them is your gang leader? Ehh? Why would I sell a painting for 150 thousand naira and on the same night go and rob someone sir? I swear I don't know how this happened, it is surely a setup! Sir! They are outside. Okay. Take the suspect back to his cell. Sir, to God am telling the truth, I am not a thief! Somebody accused me. I am telling you the truth! These people are lying, I don't know them. …please look and see if anything belong to you there. This is my Rolex watch… …this is my wedding band… …and that… looks like a bundle of cash from my boutique. It has my bank logo on it. Is that all? That's all. Ugh OK- But my... …my phone… …it's not here. Mrs Bamisaiye… …are you absolutely sure that… …you know, these items you picked out, are yours? To my... Temi. Yes... that's a wedding anniversary gift... I bought for my darling wife. Right, umm… …Mrs Bamisaiye would you terribly mind… …to …eh… …identify some of the suspects in a police line up, please? Is that necessary? It's ok darling. It's not a problem, really. Oh, Thank you very much. Ibrahim! Sir. Ugh… how many men do we have in there? We have that quack doctor, the man we arrested for fake dollars and… …we have that foolish corporal that was drunk on the parade ground… …then we have the wicked man who used his step daughter for rituals. Jonjo the rapist and... that baba who forged the Professor's will. Ok, get all of them in the line up. My friend… …it's just the two of us here. Let's talk. Tell me the truth. I'm shocked about this robbery. How did you guys plan it? What guys? I overheard… that they arrested three of your gang members. It's a Senator's wife that you guys robbed. Confide in me, …why did you rob her? At last... Is my lawyer here? Come out… You too Jonjo! Dolapo let's go. Hey Go. Next. - Did I shoot you? - Come on get inside! Move! Next. You are… beautiful. Get out! Remember what you have to do! I'm on it. Move. Next. What the hell does that mean? I didn't rob you! You know what, I want my lawyer! Take him away. I want my lawyer now. What lawyer are you looking for? Get inside or I will give you a dirty slap! Don't you know where you are? Assistant Commissioner, those men that Mrs. Bamisaiye picked out, are they your prime suspects? As a matter of fact they are. Hmm! Jolly good work, old chap. Jolly good work. Fool! You've kept me here for over 18hrs, refused me access to my lawyer, I absolutely refuse to answer any more questions. Do you recognise this? It was found in your possession, at the time of your arrest. Strange, isn't it? That a ring belonging to the victim of an armed robbery is found in your possession. You said you want your lawyer present… …no problem. But, it's my last day on the job. A new Investigating Officer will be taking over from me… …on Monday. So... …have a good day Mr. Folawe. No, wait! You mean I'm spending the weekend here? I can't! I'm getting married on Saturday! Oh! Mr. Folawe, …we do not allow weddings on police premises. Okay... Why don't you start… …from the hours leading to your arrest. Yesterday was my… …bachelor's Eve party… We were having a swell time. Everything was… enjoyable… When done, we ended up at savoy hotel. Savoy! On Isaac John? Yes. Ok It's a coded establishment, …the kind of place I wouldn't… run in to any of… …Ifeoma's clique. Ifeoma... hi.. Am at the club with my boys. Baby... No, no.. the music is so loud, I can't hear you. Sweetie-pie... No... am not a strip joint. Baby, look the music is too loud, I can't hear you... …I'll will call you when I get home, alright? Love you. Change of plans... we are leaving. Ha! You don't want to have sex again? Get your stuff! Just hearing Ifeoma's voice, brought me back to my senses. The plan was to drop the girl back at the club, and… …head home. That's when I ran into your boys. They arrested me, dragged me here... The girl was in the car when they arrested me, you can asked them! Which brings me back to this. That's my wedding ring! I bought it for Ifeoma. - It's yours? - Yes it's mine! Look, my… my best man… …Chucks, he's careless. I didn't want him loosing it before the wedding, so I dec- That is bullshit! That ring has been identified as belonging to the victim! She's is mistaken. I bought that for my fiancée. Do you have a receipt? It's with her. - Who? - Ifeoma. Your fiancée? Then we'll bring her in. I'll drag her in and interrogate her! Please, you can't do that! If she ever found out what happened last night, she'll call off the wedding! Worse still, … …she will inform her dad… oh, … my M.D. Mr. Folawe, the kind of trouble you are in right now… …your wedding, or your fiancee, or your father in law, or your job, should be the least of your worries. You were picked out in an identity parade! A police identity parade! Again… she's mistaken! Look… …I'm a bank executive! I have an MBA, for crying out loud! Why would I rob anybody? Maybe for the same reason you chose to cheat on your fiancee on the eve of your wedding. You thought you get away with it. Okay! Do you recognise these individuals? I… hmm… saw them at the identity parade. What of before the identity parade? At the Savoy, maybe. Was that where you planned the robbery? Look, I don't know those guys from a can of paint! That's funny. They seems to know you… …they confessed! They said you where the gang leader. What! Yeah… One of them wants to cut a deal, he fingered you as the Field Marshal! The Field Marshal? Either he's insane… …or you're bluffing! Mr. Folawe! Last chance to confess. You said you wanted your lawyer present? Probably need to call that lawyer now. Have a good weekend Mr. Folawe! Take him back to his cell. Okay. Let's… start again… …from the top. Only this time, you are going to tell me the truth. Chukwuka! Yes, Sir! Sir. What's the Paparazzi doing here? They are here to take photos of the four robbery suspects Sir. I didn't authorize it. It was the new Area Commander, CSP Itire. My friend, get rid of them now! Sir? You heard me, get rid of them now! Yes Sir! How did you guys plan this robbery? You've been very calm all along. Are you not worried? What's there to be worry about? Sooner or later the sins catch up with you. I don't understand. It's true. You do all these bad things and get away with it. And then one day suddenly you get arrested for something you didn't do. It's karma. Plese help me with this. Okay. This is good! Thank you! Are you… Waheed's brother? Yes. Wow! I like the way you use your colours to such great effects… …they accentuate the rich texture of the subject. The background, the shading. Great work. - Thank you. - Well done. However there is one major omission. Omission Sir? Yes. A good artist always sign off on their work. Oh… But I like it! It's good. I think I will take it. Yes boss! Sir, what is the update with my plasma tv? Oh yes, customs have cleared it, but there is small traffic at Mile 2. Did you buy it locally in Alaba market? Sergent, sergent! Sir! At ease. Sir, have you finished interrogating the last suspect? Of course I have, why do you ask? Where is he sir? My friend, what do you mean, where is he Sir? He's back in his cell! What?! Abacha! Abacha! Abacha! Open this door right now. Abacha! I want the truth. Tell me the truth. Okay, I confess! Abacha, for the last time, open this door! Screw you! Aargh… Should I force the door open? There is no need for that. Aargh… My friend, help this man up. What's going on here? Look, take him to the dispensary. Before returning him to his cell. Yes Sir. How dare you? How dare you come to my station to administer torture… …to a suspect under my watch!? He was about to confess. Under that kind of duress he will confess to sleeping with his mother. Please… Abacha! I'll be writing up a report on you in my hand-over notes. I am going to recommend disciplinary action against you! And until then, I don't want to see your ugly face anywhere around my station. Is that clear? Detective inspector!! I was assigned by the commisioner. My friend, get out of my station, right now! Now! Ugh... I will keep that. I understand you cancelled the media parade of the suspects. Itire, will any random four do for you? Because in all my years on the force, I have never, ever sent the wrong person down! And I'm not about to start doing that now. But you seem to think all your detainees are innocent! Until otherwise proven! - With all due respect… Sir… - Oh, here we go… You have 'til the end of the day. I'll be charging all four suspects and transferring them to Maximum prison first thing tomorrow morning! The Police Code Of Conduct says… …that all high profile cases must be completed in the event of you… proceeding on leave or retirement! First thing in the morning. Sir! Treacherous little kids. Hey. Yeah. Did you call me? Yes Um... I was looking for something. Okay, what was that? I've found it. Okay. Oh... Okay. My friend, what do you have for me? Nnamdi Okafor sir, I questioned his wife Alero and... …she backed up his story. He, his wife and daughter… …flew in from Accra yesterday evening. And… their generator ran out of fuel at about… 12 midnight... …and he went out with a jerrycan. Yes sir, I contacted Bayelsa HQ. And a robbery at... …Nations Bank on the 28th of last month was actually confirmed. A bystander was shot and… in the confusion afterwards, they didn't get the name. But Sir, I can confirm that a passenger bus was involved in an accident… …along Abulegba last night. Several fatalities, Sir, including the driver and the bus conductor. One survivor. Yes sir. And regarding the text you sent me on Hassan Braimoh sir, I went to Omenka Art Gallery Ikoyi and they actually confirmed that Hassan's work were on display last night. And the man who… Hassan claimed bought his artwork at the gallery… The same one that rescued him from the bridge? Yes Sir, one Mr. Daniel. He also confirmed paying Hassan a hundred and fifty thousand Naira in cash. The fourth suspect, Deji Folawe. I visited his workplace, and spoke to a colleague of his, Mr. Chuks Nwosu. I can confirm that Mr Folawe is the branch manager of Nations Bank in Yaba. Emomotimi and Hassan… claimed that they were… …going to the same Savoy hotel in Ikeja. Now the same Hassan... and Nnamdi Okafor... have as a witness... …Mr. Daniel. This Mr. Daniel! Sir, that's too much of a coincedence. I strongly believe that these suspects know each other. Is it really? My dear boy. Dare. Yes Sir. You know what? I need you to look into her movements last night. Whose movement sir? Mrs. Bamishaye… Sir? You heard me. You want me to investigate the victim? Yes. I'm just following my gut instinct. Sir, that would mean stepping on a lot of toes on this one. Well in that case my dear boy, you should... exercise extreme discretion in your modus operandi. Dismissed. Ooh… Why would I sell the painting for 150 thousand naira and the same night go and rob someone sir? It doesn't make sense. My wife must be sick with worry right now as to why I did not return home from looking for petrol last night. Talk to me guys. I expect you to believe that a man, barely to walk, isn't a likely candidate for an armed robbery! Ooh… what a day. …I'm a bank executive… What a day. …I have an MBA for crying out loud, why would I rob anybody? Messi do you have petrol? Come with me. I hear this is your first time in Ghana. Yeah. How long are you staying? Um… leaving for Accra, we have a late flight to catch. Um… Yeah. So what do you think about the slave trade? Think about the slave trade? If there are no buyers, there would be no sellers. What is this place? It's where the ladies would go when their master needs sexual favour from them. Leads to their private quarters. More like rapes then. Beautiful! My babies. Now move. Quick, quick, quick! Boss, what of my plasma TV? It's at the front desk, We are unpacking it from the box. Yes Boss! Argh! What happened to you? He teasered me, wanted me to confess. What! So… …did you now confess? I've done nothing to confess. Really? Are you sure? And if I remember correctly, …that senator's wife… …picked you out in the line up too! Did you attack and rob her? I said I've never seen that woman before in my life! But have you seen me before? Has any of you motherfuckers ever laid eyes on me before? One of you armed robbers confessed and… …that I'm the fucking gang leader! Gangster… …was it you? Was it you? Did you cut yourself a deal to rope me in? Answer me! Hey men, listen up! Don't get me angry! You won't like what I will do to you when I'm angry! Hey, guys calm down. Why? Guys… …it's only us here now, eh? Tell me the truth… …did you rob that lady? No! No problem. Tomorrow morning… …they will charge all of you in court, …transfer you to a maximum prison. Unfortunately… …you won't be watching my plasma TV with me. What sort of moron is this guy? Eh? You really think they're gonna bring a TV in here for you to watch? You fool! There's plasma TV in prisons abroad! And how did you know? I watched it in Prison Break. And I bet you watch Prison Break while you were serving a prison sentence in America, right? Did you commit rape there too? I didn't rape anybody! Really? Officer! Hey! Stay there! He is wearing a wire! He is wearing a wire! He's been recording us. He's the real thief, traitor! Give me your log book. Ibrahim. Sir! You have the worst handwriting in the world. Thank you sir. That wasn't a compliment. So, you couldn't get them to confess? Madam I tried… …but they all said they were innocent. Innocent? Like you. Right? Ahh, Madam! I'm very innocent, I'm very innocent. It's a pity Jonjo. Corporal. Ma. Return him to his cell. Move! Wait, wait, hold on, Madam! In that same cell, with those hardened criminals? You want them to kill me? - Move! Move! - Wait, please wait! - Madam! These people will kill me! - Rapist move! They are going to kill me! What about our deal Madam?! You have three watches entered here, …but there are four watches here. One, Two, Three, Four. Four, Ibrahim, Four! One, Two, Three, Four. Where did the fourth one come from? To be honest, boss, I don't know. There were three watches when I booked the suspects yesterday! Ibrahim. Sir! Where did the fourth watch come from? Look at them!! One, Two, Three, Four. Your log book is saying three watches! Ibrahim, can you at least identify the three watches that you booked? I'll get back to you. Ok Sir! I found a tracker device on Mrs. Bamishaye's vehicle, so I traced the firm… …ADEX… And what did they say? Senator Bamishaye's son, Rayo... called them around 11pm last night... …to trace Mrs. Bamishaye's vehicle. At 11pm? Yes Sir. Well, they called to tell him that the vehicle have been traced to Opebi, and he subsequently told them that no actions are to be taken. Why would Rayo... …Senator Bamishaye's son want to know where his father's wife is, an hour before she was attacked? I'll pick him up in the morning sir. Don't bring him here. Bring him to the park. Yes Sir. Gangster was saying earlier… …something about our past deeds finally catching up with us. Oh please! This place is driving you mad. It's driving all of us insane. You mean you've never committed a crime before? You have never done anything wrong before? My past doesn't determine my future. Just because I've gotten away with some things I did wrong in the past, doesn't f♪♪♪king mean I should be punished for it in the present! Then you have nothing to worry about, my friend. Eh? You know we have to go, right? Are you sure? …Deji? Are you really… …sure? I should never have slept with her. How dare you Commissioner Kilanko? How dare you have me abducted from my office and… dragged here like a common criminal? Well you look to me like… …a common criminal. Sit your arse down! Sit down! So tell me, what was it? Envy… …or plain lust? I'm sorry you've lost me. You sent four armed robbers to attack Mrs. Bamishaye, didn't you? Hell no! I had nothing to do with the robbery! For the love of God, she's my father's wife! Oh, that seems to me like a good enough motive… …because ever since your mother died… …your father married his young, beautiful, delectable wife… …stirring in you raw feelings of jealousy, envy… …and resentment. No, …No…. No. Nooo! At 11pm you put a call through to ADEX tracking company, …requesting to know the location of Mrs. Bamishaye's vehicle! You were later informed that the vehicle was in Opebi, so... And bam! One hour later, she was attacked by four armed robbers! Well… …I am arresting… …and charging you for being an accessory… …to armed robbery and attempted murder! Cuff him! Yes Sir. Get up please. Hold on! Hold your horses. I'll talk. So go on… …spill! Look. My father called me up at about 10pm, saying he was worried he couldn't locate wifey. I told him not to stress, you know… she probably got caught up in traffic or misplaced her phone. That's it? Yeah. My friend cuff this man! - Okay get up, get up please. - Okay, Okay! Last year… …I had all the Senator's vehicles fitted with… …with tracking devices. And? Come on! Do the bloody math! A 79 year old man with a… 28 year old wife! He was never going to be able to chew gum and satisfy that at the same time! So, she had a mechanic on the outside who services her regularly? Some… …looser called Tosan Bazuaye. She was at his place last night. Last night? Yet you didn't tell the Senator. Damn! If he ever found out Temi was cheating? That kind of fear can make a woman spin an armed robbery tale Hey! Hey! ..hey, hey Hold on guys, Hold on a second. I had my doubts too, but… I was there. And so were you commissioner. We both saw her identifiy the suspects and pick out the stolen property. So… …where can we find… …this Tosan Bazuaye, or your looser, as you call him? Hello! Get in the car! Oh boy, this looks bad. I'm fine! Mr Traitor! You see, let me tell you something, where I'm from, we kill traitors like you. Right away! I'm sorry! That new Area Comander… …she forced me! I had no choice. Don't talk like that, we all have a choice! Eh? Come here Flatbush, give me that cigarette. Carry on. Put a smile on your face my friend. In a matter of hours our ransom will be paid and you'll be out of here on your way to the airport straight back to Philippines to meet your family! Thank you very very much, you are a good friend. You kept me safe here, you are a good friend. Maybe next time, you won't follow a prostitute to a strange hotel. Nigerian women are sweet women… …sweet, very sweet. You are not ready to go home yet. Fuck you! The shit has finally caught up with me now! Tosan Bazuaye! Stop there! Motherfucker! Hey! …Wait! Hey! Hey! ...Stop! Going somewhere? Huh? No! No! Dolapo… What's going on here? Sir, I need you to hand over Mr. Bazuaye into my protective custody. What is he doing here? He's been re-assigned to the case. By who? By me, … the New Area Commander. How dare you Chief Superintendent? I am still the Area Commander. And I gave you a direct order- Contrary to superior orders! You went behind my back to pursue an alternative line of investigation! Now hand the suspect over, Sir. Hell will freeze over first, you know that. You know I have no qualms ordering my man to open fire if necessary! On a fellow police officer? Dolapo! I dare you! Guys! Guys, can I just go? Shut up! Chief Superintendent, let me give a piece of… fatherly advice. Um... Lower your weapons both of you, …and walk away. I need that suspect in MY protective custody! It is not going to happen. My case… …my suspect. My jurisdiction… …my command. And I am your superior officer and I'm ordering you… …to lower your weapon… …now. Dolapo, I pity you. Because right now you are in grave danger of… of being brought up on charges of insurbodination. And it will be a real shame… …if this your career… …this your promising career… …ends up… abruptly… So... what is it going to be? Lower your weapon. Inspector, lower your weapon. Abacha! Stand down! He needs to stand down first! You stand down first. Okay? Abacha, I'm ordering you to lower your weapon... now. Aargh! Oops! Get in the car now! Nice shot sir! Yeah. Mr Loverman indeed. Why did you run when you saw us? Well, I thought… Senator Bamishaye sent you… to arrest me, so I ran. Arrest you… …why? Sir. What's this sir? Check, find out yourself. Sir, what's this for? If you ever see her again, both of you will live to regret it, for the rest of your lives. Start talking about last night. My friend stand up! And wipe that grin off your face. When did she leave here last night? 12 midnight thereabout. Hey! …Hey! What's up? 13 missed calls from him. What are you going to tell him? I don't know? Come, come on! I got to go! And so she left. Since she departed from here, have you heard again from her? No no, I haven't… …I tried to call her but her phones are switched off. Did you tell Mrs. Bamishaye about her husband's visit? No, I didn't want to stress her. You lying little rat! You just want to eat your cake and have it right? No. no, no. - Like… I love Temi! - Ahh! I really do! Ah… yes… …almost as much as you love a million naira, …hmmm? Hmmm? Sir, 1 million is a lot of money. Listen to me. Let me give you a piece of friendly advice. If I were you, …I will keep a very low profile... until this case is over. What does that mean? Like? Whoa! Darling… …you look ravishing! Well, as always. Uh-huh. Are you ready? Yes. But... …I need to make a quick call. Okay, please make it quick, I'm hungry. I believe that's coming from the bar Are you not going to answer it? From your stolen phone... …it seems. Oh Lord, I'm tired! Sorry Sir. It's Okay, I just need my bed. But Sir… - Yes? - Tell me… …how do you think Mrs. Bamishaye pulled this off? Well, in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is the king! Hmm… Dare, we are all looking… without seeing… She didn't pick the watch from evidence, she slipped it in. Right under our noses! What about the other items, the cash and the wedding ring? Ah, they were never hers. The wedding ring was Deji's, the cash, Hassan's. But Sir, another question- How did you manage… …to accurately… …give a description of the suspects that were apprehended? While I… While I was driving home that night… …I… saw each of them… …around… the Isaac John… Sobo Crossroad. I didn't for a second think they will be apprehended! Look, they were definitely the wrong guys… …at the right place, but at the wrong time! Mrs. Bamishaye framed all of them! Ah, but I'll give her one thing though… …she is clever. …Very clever. But sir, her car was destroyed in the attack. How do you explain that? I ran into some drunkards, …and I swerved to avoid…hitting them, and I ended up… …hitting a lamp post. So she went through the whole charade, just… to fool her husband? Oh yes, you heard what the Senator's son said; Rayo… …she means the world to him. She is his priced possession, his trophy wife! This boyfriend of yours... Tosan... do you love him? Do you love him? No! He just makes me feel like a woman. Alright… …I forgive you. I know you still love me. I know... I know for sure you did not mean to hurt me! Which is why… you cooked up your story… …to spare my feelings. We are going to pretend… …the affair never happened. Put it behind us… …and… continue… with… …this… wonderful marriage. But what about… the police, the case, and… …the robbery suspects? They can rot in jail! You are my only… …concern. But… …this your lover boy in Opebi… …it's over! Your boutique… is closing down. Your movements… restricted. You will remain in this house… 24/7! When you step out, …it will be right by my side… …only. I… …own you. I own all of you! You are… completely… - MINE! - No! Never! You do not own me! I have given you five years of my life!, And I cannot bear the thought of your… creepy hands… …ever on me again! And I want out… …of this prison sentence, that you call a marriage!! Sir, …do you think CSP Itire is on the Senator's payroll? Oh, no no no, she was just trying to show off in the presence of the Commissioner. But I'll tell you something Dare, this… …is still my case because I have a few hours left before I retire. Copy that Sir. I warned him… …I warned that your boyfriend… …what I will do to him… …if he… does not… …stop …bothering you! I gave you my world… but... …yet, you betrayed me! - Hello! - Good evening Sir. We would like to see the Senator. Chief Superintendent Itire said only she can call on the Senator. - She said that? - Yes Sir. - Do you know who I am? - Yes Sir. - So open the gate. - I can't. Did you hear that? What the hell? Check her pulse. Senator! What have you done? Senator, what have you done? It's… …it misfired. Dare! I loved her. I really… loved her! Senator, please, …put down your gun. Please! But it was not… enough. Senator please sir, …please sir! Let's not make things… …any worse than they already are. She was such a beautiful angel! I couldn't bear to loose her… She's already dead sir. Uh-huh… …then, …she was with me… to the end. Right? Senator please sir, please sir… Put the gun down, don't make things any worse than they already are! Let's work something out. Let me help you Sir! What is the point? Oh senator please, don't do anything stupid! Don't do anything stupid! - Dare! - Sir. - Your lighter, quickly! - I've stopped smoking Sir. Oh my God! What is the point? Senator please, please don't do anything stupid! Dare, your phone, anything, put on the light. Anything! Senator please, don't do anything stupid! What is the point? Nooooo! - Dare. - Sir. Careful… Lets follow this side… Careful, careful. Gently, gently! Dare, hang on to this. He just couldn't imagine his life without her in it. I guess so. It's a real shame. Agh… Did you hear that? Help her up, go on. Get up. Easy, easy, …easy. You okay? How do you feel? Sir, …I swear she had no pulse! Dare, it's okay. Nnamdi Okafor, Deji Folawe, Hassan Ibrahimo, Emomotimi Jomo! No case, you are all to be released. What? Bro! Where is my plasma TV? Jonjo… …pending your trial, …the new Area Commander has ordered your immediate transfer to maximum security prison. Maximum security? Yes... Argh! That woman is wicked! Salute Sir! - Morning. - Good Morning Sir. We are just processing out your detainees now. But they are your detainees now. Bro, Bayelsa boy, wake up we are released! They have released you. Maybe just like the rest of us, he's tired of listening to you. Out! I am so sorry about yesterday! I overstepped my boundaries and I appreciate you are not taking disciplinary action against me. Dolapo, …do you know what this job is really all about? It's the ability to… …determine what is grey… …when everything else around you, looks totally black… or white. Corporal!! - Corporal! - What's that? - What's going on? - You go back and finish the processing! Go back! Wake him up, I said wake him up! Corporal! Wake up! Corporal! Hey! Hey! My friend leave here! What is going on here? Mam, I swear I didn't touch him! I called his name for release and he didn't stand up! Death in custody… …and that is all I need for my own first day at work! You know they say the best time to bow out is when the ovation… is loudest. Looks like I'm right on queue. After 38 years of service in the police… …one would have thought I would be jaded by now. However, …I'm convinced more than ever… …that the police force is the last bastion… …of service and honour…. In any civil society. We will not always get it right… …but we must, …we must always, …always aim at not to get it wrong. I am Indeed very privilledged… …to have served amongst you men of integrity. Because what we do for a living… …is by no means for the faint-hearted… …or lily-livered. It takes bravery, …valour …and dedication. So please my friends, keep that flag flying high. So that when you get to the Zenith of your career… …like me, you can look back… …with warm thoughts of Honour, Service, and Distinction. Thank you. Thank you very much, it has been… an honour… …standing shoulder to shoulder with all of you. God bless you! God bless the Nigerian police force! And God bless the Federal Republic Of Nigeria. Thank you!
