HENRY KISSINGER: I am a little bothered by that last answer where you said, "Are you sorry or should he have done anything differently?" And thought, and I say, you know, I'm going to learn the right answer to that someday. That looks sort of arrogant, and I'd like to rephrase that same thought in a different way. You have to understand, you are presiding over a historical process of a magnitude that the world has never seen. I certainly would go that same direction again, painful as some of the aspects of it were. At this period in my life I'm not running a popularity contest on Google. l have to stand on what I did and wrote and be somewhat fatalistic about it. Can we stop this for one second? RICHARD NIXON: I'm gonna turn right so goddamn hard, it will make your head spin. I'm going to bomb those bastards right off the earth. I really mean it. KISSINGER: I think that's right. DAN RATHER: Henry Kissinger is the right man in the right place at the right time doing the rightjob. NIXON: Henry, this is the President. Listen, we're playing for very high stakes, and we have very little time left. MAN: Dr. Kissinger, referred to by the President as the senior diplomat of the world, has really pulled another miracle. NIXON: Hello, Henry? Where are you? NARRATOR: "After work," said Kissinger, "I try to be with a beautiful girl." KISSINGER: Listen, I used to be a serious person before you people caught up with me. I don't stand on protocol. If you'll just call me Excellency, it will be good. Everything is beginning to fit together. [rumbling] REPORTER: Dr. Kissinger, we have just learned, too, that the Russians have sent a man 186 miles into the sky and returned him. Would you care to comment on that? KISSINGER: It seems to me that this supports the conclusions of the Rockefeller report. It indicates that, probably, the Russians are considerably ahead of us in the missile field, because it shows that they have rocket engines, which have a thrust far greater than any that we possess at the moment. NIALL FERGUSON: Your Harvard senior thesis was famously the longest ever written, and it had a pretty grand title, too— "The Meaning of History." KISSINGER: Yes. FERGUSON: That's quite ambitious for an undergraduate, isn't it? KISSINGER: When Iwas an undergraduate at Harvard, I was totally undecided in what direction Iwould wind up. For example, I was phenomenally good in elementary chemistry courses. Until I realized that this was pure memory. Then I was playing with the idea of maybe becoming a creative writer, and that awakened my interest in philosophy of history. THOMAS SCHELLING: Henry was not a warm, friendly, modest, jovial sort of person. He was thought of as one of the more anxious, temperamental, self-conscious, ambitious, inconsiderate people at Harvard. KISSINGER: Then I wrote a best seller called Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy. NARRATOR: The work which made his reputation promoted the notion that a limited nuclear war might be winnable by the United States. But one critic complained, "I don't know if Kissinger is a great writer, but anyone finishing his book is a great reader." It brought a note of congratulations from then Vice President Nixon. KISSINGER: After his election in 1968, Nixon invited me to visit him at his transition headquarters at the Pierre Hotel in New York. Nixon talked to me for about two hours about the international situation, and I knew he wanted something, but I didn't know what. About a week later, John Mitchell, who was one of Nixon's closest aides at that time, called me up and said, "Well, are you gonna take the job or not?" And I said, "Whatjob?" NIXON: Dr. Henry Kissinger, Professor of Government at Harvard University, has agreed to come with the White House staff as the assistant to the President-elect for National Security Affairs. [applause] KISSINGER: I have often thought the personality of Richard Nixon will require a Shakespeare to render, partly because there were so many different Nixons. He must have been seared by rejection at an early stage in his life. Nixon did not have close friends, nor was I one of them. But he didn't have much of a social life with anybody. NARRATOR: Back in the Oval Office, the valet has brought in the President's dog, King Timaho. NIXON: He's used to good furniture. Want to go out? Go out? KISSINGER: One has to remember, here is a man who was not a natural politician. He hated to meet new people, he was basically shy. He felt fundamentally threatened. NIXON: Here we go. NIXON: Yeah, hello, Henry? KISSINGER: Mr. President, I think we're on the right course. I've read the speech over, and I think it is very strong now. NIXON: Yeah, it's a pretty good speech, actually. KISSINGER: Ithink it's an excellent speech. NIXON: Good evening, my fellow Americans. KISSINGER: For Nixon to make a major speech was a huge extended effort of getting himself ready for confrontation. OPERATOR: Dr. Kissinger. NIXON: Yeah. KISSINGER: Mr. President? NIXON: Yeah, hi, Henry. KISSINGER: This was the best speech you've delivered since you've been in office. NIXON: This little speech was a work of art. I mean, know a little something about speech writing, and it was no act, because no actor could do it. No actor in Hollywood could have done that that well. I thought that was done well, didn't you think? KISSINGER: Well, no actor could have written it. You couldn't have done it unless you meant it. NIXON: OK. Thank you. Bye. KISSINGER: Talk to you later. Bye-bye. After every speech, he expected his key associates to call him to tell him that he had done well, which he, in his own mind, would then translate that he had not done badly. NARRATOR: Kissinger meets alone with the President every day, sometimes for as long as an hour and a half. And here he can make his own views known if his counsel's asked for. KISSINGER: My influence depended on my relationship with Nixon. I would call ten times a day, and see him every time I could. I would spend a lot of time with him in very intense conversations. What is the role of particular groups? What is the state of the world? In January 1969, the United States was in an extremely complicated situation. It was three years after total involvement in the Vietnam War. It was the first year in which the protest movement had turned absolutely ugly and violent. Internationally, we had no contact whatever with China. Relations with the Soviet Union had been frozen. And the Soviet Union was building a submarine base in Cuba. So to think that there was a Communist problem in the world at that moment was not the paranoid imagination of a president. NIXON: Yeah. OPERATOR: I have Dr. Kissinger now, Mr. President. NIXON: Hello? KISSINGER: Mr. President. NIXON: Listen, we can't diddle around with the Russians or anybody else. KISSINGER: Right. NIXON: We are playing for very high stakes, and we have very little time left. KISSINGER: We were engaged in an ideological struggle with the Soviet Union with incompatible value systems. We were engaged in a power struggle with the Soviet Union. There were Soviet troops "1 EQYPt, and it supplied most, if not all, of the military equipment for Vietnam. We could not permit Soviet domination of the world on the basis of either their principles or of their power. So this had to be resisted. On the other hand, we also believed that the nuclear age imposed a special obligation on leaders— especially of the nuclear countries. [speaking Russian] KISSINGER: The nuclear arms race was out of control in the sense that by the late '60s, it was predictable that the Soviet Union would exceed our number in strategic missiles. Imagine the dialogue that somebody goes in to the president and says, "If you would fire 1,000 missiles tomorrow, you can wipe out the Soviet force. You'll kill 30, 40 million people in the process in one day." And I have to add that one of my moral dilemmas in government always was this—what would I do if the President asked me, "Is this the day that we do it?" And I must say, frankly, I had not made up, reached a conclusive answer in my mind. Because it's one thing to win a war with historic casualties, that's serious enough. To kill tens of millions of people in one day creates a new world. The world will never be the same. [helicopter approaches] NIXON: If we, if we start, you know, simpering around and catering to these bastards, hell, they'll just eat us alive. KISSINGER: We've got to do something dramatic soon. FERGUSON: Cold War politics aside, the Vietnam War was not exactly going well. Under previous administrations, including President Lyndon Johnson's, more than 30,000 Americans had already been killed in action. So why not just stop the war and pull the troops out? KISSINGER: One has to understand the basic strategy pursued by the Johnson Administration. It was an extraordinary concept of warfare. 500,000 American troops were committed without a definition of victory. The purpose of the strategy was to inflict so much pain on the North Vietnamese that they would enter negotiation. But it turned out that their level of pain toleration was much higher than had been estimated. NIXON: I'm gonna turn right so goddamn hard, it'll make your head spin. We'll bomb those bastards right off the earth. I really mean it, and Ithink you agree, don't you? KISSINGER: I think, Mr. President, we have to make fundamental decisions. NIXON: That's right. KISSINGER: The Nixon Administration came into office on January 20th. Three weeks later, the North Vietnamese started an offensive that killed between 400 and 500 Americans a week. Our strategy was the withdrawal of American troops while, at the same time, guaranteeing the security of our long-standing ally, South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese demands were the following— that America had to agree to an unconditional withdrawal of all its forces. We were really talking, in effect, about surrender. That could not, that was not, of course, not acceptable. To begin an administration by a man whose conservative record had been established over 20 years, by simply announcing, in effect, surrender, which were the only terms open to us, was inconceivable. SOLDIER 1: This is, this all probably seeds, and we're getting busted, but I don't care. SOLDIER 2: Shotgun. KISSINGER: I believe the vast majority of Americans, they wanted the war over with. But the biggest problem domestically was whether we could finally unite the country in which those who wanted peace would have peace and those who wanted honor could live with themselves. In August 1969, we started to meet the North Vietnamese secretly in Paris. I had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won militarily. And, therefore, I favored negotiation. My principal opposite number was Le Duc Tho. Though he aged me prematurely, Le Duc Tho was a remarkable man. [speaking Vietnamese] He came from the capital of a distant country, with no international experience. He had spent his entire life being a revolutionary, and there he faced a representative of a superpower, never lost his poise, infinitely tenacious, almost always polite. His conduct was obnoxious and impeccable. The son of a bitch. We get in there on Monday afternoon, he withdraws every concession he's made two weeks previously. It was a roller coaster, up and down the whole time. His job was not negotiation. His job was to break our spirit by brilliantly exploiting our domestic divisions. In America, we were constantly accused of not wanting a settlement. Some of the very best people in the country developed the view that the war itself reflected some weakness or failure of the American soul, and that it was in our interest to lose it. FERGUSON: It was the bombing of Cambodia that came to be the focus of this domestic opposition. Why was it, and why is it still today so contentious? KISSINGER: The so-called secret bombing of Cambodia is one of the most deliberately misrepresented episodes of that period. Let's first understand clearly what happened. [jet airplane] GEORGE McGOVERN: A terrible war has been charted behind closed doors. I want those doors open, and I want that war closed! [crowd cheers] NIXON: Have them fly at 95,000 or 110,000 feet and drop their goddamn bombs on the boondocks, but get up some... I want a hell of a lot of sorties flown by B-52s today. Is that clear? KISSINGER: Right, Mr. President. On January 20th, within three weeks of his coming into office, while the White House people still didn't even know where all the bathrooms were, the North Vietnamese launched an attack in which 400 Americans were killed a week. Most of these attacks came from base areas that the North Vietnamese had established on Cambodian soil. Nixon, faced with these dilemmas, decided to authorize attacks. He saw to minimize the danger of these demonstrations that had taken place erupting again, by not announcing that these attacks were taking place. HAROLD KNIGHT: While I was in South Vietnam, the falsification of strike reports was a common practice. I prepared at least a dozen myself. I got the impression that the practice had been going on for several years prior to the time I got there. All the reports I personally faked were 3-52 strikes into Cambodia. KISSINGER: The plan was that we would undertake one attack. That then somebody would announce it, complain. To our amazement, nobody complained. Not Sihanouk, the ruler of the country, not the North Vietnamese... ...nobody. I thought it was appropriate to attack those bases. FERGUSON: What about the accusation that hundreds of thousands of defenseless civilians were killed? KISSINGER: Hundreds of thousands is total rubbish. I am talking about the so-called secret bombing. There was almost no civilian population. Undoubtedly, civilians were killed as a result of military operations, but what I am saying applies only to the secret bombing. NIXON: When they say we're killing civilians, we'll say, well, now, there were a lot of civilians killed in the south. KISSINGER: Right, Mr. President. HUBERT HUMPHREY: We now face the unhappy prospect of an expansion of the war in Southeast Asia, and most regrettably, the prospect of increased tension and protest and even violence, I'm afraid, here at home. NARRATOR: As on many other campuses across the nation, students at Kent demonstrated against Nixon's decision to send American troops into Cambodia. National Guardsmen opened fire without warning on a crowd of students, killing four who were not even taking part in the demonstration. [gunshot] KISSINGER: The controversy over Cambodia deepened domestic divisions, but it was the right decision and had to be taken. I don't regret it, because I think Nixon was basically right. For me, the protest movement was a personally extremely painful experience. NARRATOR: While his children are with him, Kissinger tries to keep his afternoons free. He'll take them to a beach near his home where they can swim while he walks or simply sits on the beach and fights off efforts to get him in the water. DAUGHTER: Come on, daddy. It's a beautiful ocean. You'll be thinking, you'll be thinking of us. KISSINGER: I was separated from my wife at the time, but I visited my children regularly. They tell me that in their schools there was sometimes harassment, not by the other children, but by their teachers, like being asked to write on a blackboard, "Please drive the love of war out of President Nixon's heart," which, for a child of mine, was a painful choice they had to make. Almost all my friends were engulfed in the protest movement, all the people I'd gone to school with. REPORTER: Last May, 12 of his former Harvard colleagues came to the White House to tell him bluntly, and on the record, of their disappointment over the decision to go into Cambodia. SCHELLING: That we came to tell Mr. Kissinger that we were not only deeply disturbed... REPORTER: Last month I spoke to the man who led that group, Kissinger's good friend for 10 years, Harvard Economics Professor Tom Schelling. SCHELLING: And after an hour and half, I think he must have been affected by the fact that 12 people, all of whom he knew, all of whose views he knew, all of whom would not have wanted personally to hurt him or embarrass him, felt obliged to come and tell him that they were so shocked with him and his president, that, in effect, they were backing out of any more personal relation. KISSINGER: Iwould have preferred to retain many friendships that were weakened as a result of this. I had my obligation, as I saw it, was to put fonNard my convictions to the best of my ability and to carry them out. There is no secret about my views. NIXON: I pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace. I have an issue... KISSINGER: The most haunting problem at that time was that this domestic conflict adversely affected the peace negotiations. NIXON: For the more divided we are at home, the less likely the enemy is to negotiate in Paris. HENRI SALVADOR: Each time we see Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Le Duc Tho, they come to Paris, they congratulate, they shake hands, they give a big smile. Then they go back to their countries and one month again, they reappear, they come back and say "Hello!" big smile again, the journalists ask the question. No answer. All the time. I say, this is a good song. J‘ Kissinger J‘ J‘ Le Duc Tho J‘ J‘ Kissinger J‘ J‘ Le Duc Tho J‘ J‘ Kissinger J‘ J‘ Le Duc Tho J‘ [imitating Asian speech] The reason why I'm in Paris again... [speaking French] KISSINGER: They had not fought for 30 years in order to make a compromise in which they did not get power. SALVADOR: All we want is peace. J‘ Kissinger J‘ J‘ Le Duc Tho J‘ KISSINGER: You see, every draft we give back to them already incorporates 70% of their changes. The trouble is we have an entirely new document, and Le Duc Tho is going to walk out. So the meetings were extremely long and extraordinarily inconclusive. And the things I have said to him in front of his people, you would not believe. You know, about his tawdry performance, about his extraordinary trickery. NIXON: It takes two to make a deal. There must be give and take on both sides, and I'm convinced that the agreement, as modified, and as we will modify it, is a good one. We can make it better, but we cannot scuttle it, and Iwill not do it. KISSINGER: Periods of intense activity would be followed by months when there was little contact at all. So it was very cynical, very tough. How do I get out of here? Sorry to disturb you. NIXON: It's all right. No, I'm not doing anything. How are the casualties running this week? KISSINGER: They are above 50, actually. They're going to be announced tomorrow. Ithink 56. NIXON: Around 56, you say? KISSINGER: That's right. NIXON: Oh, my. KISSINGER: For every reason, we have got to have a diversion from Vietnam in this country for a while. NIXON: That's the point, isn't it, yeah? FERGUSON: So you were in the middle of the Cold War, with the ever-present threat of nuclear Armageddon, you were fighting a bloody war in Southeast Asia that was ripping the country apart. What on Earth were you going to do? KISSINGER: President Nixon and I had been working from the beginning on a strategy to bring peace to the world. We had detected that the Soviet Union and China were adversaries rather than allies. And we also believed that the constellation in the world was unnatural. China was out of the international system. So the strategy was including China in international affairs would give the Soviet Union something else to think about. And finally there was another important consideration. By improving relations with China, it could be persuaded to use its influence to induce the Vietnamese into making concessions. NIXON: Oh, Henry, the thing is, a historic change is going to take place— it has to take place. We're not going overboard, but we're saying, well, if they open the door, we'll open the door. KISSINGER: Ithink if we get this thing working, we'll end Vietnam this year. Between 1954 and 1970, there had really been no diplomatic contact with China. REPORTER: Chairman Mao is here. Chairman Mao is here. [choir singing] KISSINGER: In the '60s there was the so-called Cultural Revolution, which we knew was dramatic and awful. China was engaged in extremely deplorable and immoral behavior. This led to dramatic hardship for millions of people. But that was not the key point. While the ovenNhelming dangers seemed the imminence of nuclear war, the human rights behavior of various countries was not a basic principle of American foreign policy. When we opened to China, we did so on the basis of national interest. The biggest problem was how to communicate with the Chinese. Finally, on a visit to Pakistan, we asked the Pakistan president to pass a message. The messages between China and the United States passed in the following manner. The Chinese would send us a handwritten note, which was given to a Pakistan emissary, delivered in Islamabad, brought by another Pakistan emissary to Washington. We replied on a typed paper, with no watermarks, which was sent back to Pakistan and hence to Beijing in the same manner. So it was almost like historic diplomacy in the sense that an exchange of messages took a minimum of six days. NIXON: Now on the China thing, what we have to realize, Henry, is that in terms of the American public opinion, it is still against Communist China, you know? KISSINGER: Right. NIXON: So we're not, we're not making any boasts with this. KISSINGER: You said, "I want no publicity whatsoever." NIXON: Yeah, yeah. KISSINGER: Nixon had the courage to open to China with only one advisor and no previous consultation with other countries, because he thought that if it became public before he could announce it, it would never be carried out. NIXON: Let me say that the envoy, the more I think about it— the envoy thing— if we're gonna go, I think we ought to go at the highest level. KISSINGER: I think the envoy could prepare for it. NIXON: You just can't tell. And I don't know if there's anybody we can trust to send over there. KISSINGER: Nixon needed a representative who knew his thinking very well and who knew how this plot would evolve. When I arrived in Beijing, I was greeted by Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, who was the ranking officer of the armed forces at the time, a veteran of the Long March. And he escorted me to a state guesthouse. The next morning, we were taken to the Forbidden City, which had been closed to the public for that day, and which, empty, is truly magical. [man speaking Chinese] KISSINGER: You could see how these Chinese emperors impressed the envoys coming from distant countries with the majesty and simplicity of that architecture. Nixon coming to China did not come up until there were 18 hours left for my departure. Of course, you can say all of this was cleverly designed to get our back against the wall. Because for me to have gone to China, and with no result, would have not been widely acclaimed in Washington. NIXON: Let's face it, in the long run, it's so historic. You know, when you stop to think of 800 million people, where they're going to be, Jesus, this is a hell of a move. KISSINGER: One has to understand that Nixon had gone through three years having demonstrated extraordinary fortitude in the face of often very violent protests. So it was inevitable and understandable that he wanted to be the person on whom attention would focus. NIXON: If we make the breakthrough on China, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened in, you know, 20 years, Henry. KISSINGER: A historic turning point, Mr. President. NIXON: That's right. They all know it, don't they? KISSINGER: Oh, no question. Not a question. REPORTER: This is the historic handshake the President of the United States travelled halfway across the world to make with Premier Chou En Lai at Peking airport. KISSINGER: Every meeting followed a certain pattern. And the pattern was this— the Chinese never told you ahead of time when you would see Mao. You were then taken to Mao's residence, which was in the Forbidden City, in a house like any other house. Very simple. No armed guards. You went past a corridor that had a ping pong table in it, into the study, which, on my first visit to him, had a bed in the corner, and that bed later disappeared. There were books scattered all over the floor. Mao was sitting in a semi-circle of easy chairs. Mao would then get up and would start a conversation. In my public life, I've met a few people whose presence dominated a room, like that of great actors who can step on the stage, and just stepping on it, win the audience. And Mao was one of these figures. There's no doubt that when Mao got up, there was a concentrated willpower emanating from him. He had a sardonic sense of humor. Also slightly threatening, always threatening. Mao said to me, "You see, Professor, I will be easy to deal with. Every concession I make is for a thousand years." What he was really telling me is, "Watch out, if you get into a fight with me, it won't end easily." [orchestra playing] One of Nixon's nightmares always was endless dinners. [speaking Chinese] Nixon was never at ease at big banquets. He didn't like big banquets. But he liked the Chinese occasions, because they were colorful. They were a culmination of years of his efforts, and because they, with all the drama, they didn't last too long. From the point of view of strategy and long-term policy, it was the most seminal event of the Nixon first term. The more long-term impact was, first of all, on the American public. It demonstrated that America had options in the world that could not be, that were not exhausted by Vietnam. NIXON: All in all, of course, the whole thing that you can take some comfort in— you know, we talk about how this happened, and it wouldn't have happened if you hadn't stuck to your guns through this period, too, you know. KISSINGER: Mr. President, you made it possible. NIXON: We have played a game, and we've gotten a little break here. We were hoping we'd get one, and I think we have one now. If we play it skillfully and we'll wait a couple of weeks and then... KISSINGER: But we set up this whole intricate web. When we talked about linkage, everyone was sneering. NIXON: Yeah, I know. KISSINGER: But we've done it now. Everything is beginning to fit together. Let's talk about the secrecy. The mechanics of opening to China, they were done secretly. Every president had felt constrained to have private emissaries. The peculiarity of the Nixon Administration was that they used one private emissary for everything. NIXON: That's right, that's right. Well, Ijust wish that we operated without the bureaucracy. We do. KISSINGER: All the good things that are being done are done without them. NIXON: We do, we do, we do. KISSINGER: One has to understand, first of all, why the secret, why there was a secret back channel. Well, now there are two ways of doing that. One would be to do it back channel via Connolly, the other would be to tell it through State. NIXON: No, no. Back channel through Connolly. KISSINGER: Right, that's what I thought. NIXON: That's good. Great, Henry. Bye, thank you. KISSINGER: Some of the requirements of secrecy arose from the fact, not that we wanted to keep something from the press, but we wanted to keep something from the State Department bureaucracy. And over there, they waffle around and give you on the one hand and on the other hand. NIXON: And write reams of nothing. KISSINGER: And write reams of stuff that evaporates under your fingers. NIXON: Yeah. KISSINGER: Nixon had developed an almost compulsive distrust of the State Department. REPORTER: Despite the highest level denials, Henry Kissinger is, by all accounts, the President's principal advisor on foreign policy, far more influential than Secretary of State Rogers. And this one lean fact has suddenly kicked off the hottest controversy in town. Operating out of these freshly redecorated offices at the White House, Kissinger has been slowly accumulating power, his staff more than doubled to 110, his budget quadrupled, now $2.3 million a year. STUART SYMINGTON: It makes the Secretary of State, in effect, a figurehead. REPORTER: Secretary, can you give us a progress report on the talks so far? WILLIAM ROGERS: No, thanks, I'm just a little late for dinner. Ithink I should go in. Thank you. [Nixon speaking] NIXON: I know all of you will want to hear from the new Secretary of State, speaking for the first time in that capacity. KISSINGER: In September 1973, I became Secretary of State. There is no country in the world where it is conceivable that a man of my origins could be standing here next to the President of the United States. [applause] [Nixon speaking] FERGUSON: What does this photograph make you remember? KISSINGER: It's a photograph, obviously, of my mother with my brother and me. And we were a close family. My grandfather lived in a village 40 miles from Furth, the town in which I was born. But in those days, it took several hours to bicycle there, and that's what we often did. Of course, every village through which you drove had a sign at the entrance saying, "Jews are not desired here." The Nazis came to power when I was 9 years old. I was prohibited to go from, to German schools. All the German people with whom my parents associated more or less cut off all contact with us. [chanting] For my parents, it was a shocking change in their life. My parents weren't intellectuals. My father was a teacher and not a practical man. And he was sort of paralyzed in the face of the evil the Nazis represented. My mother was more elemental, extremely practical. And she decided, for the sake of her children, that they should leave Germany. My father didn't object. What I felt was the loss of all the associations of my friends when we left Germany. That was a wrench in my life that had a deep impact on me. It was the possibility that what had given you security could disintegrate. Three years after I arrived as a refugee, America and Germany were at war, and I was drafted into the United States Army. REPORTER: American youth rallies to the colors, volunteers to man the ramparts against the Axis menace, against the white and yellow bandits who would banish freedom from the earth. KISSINGER: When I came back to Germany, I experienced aspects of the holocaust from the point of a member of the army of occupation. We drove in, and I was amongst, probably, the first who was there. As I remember it, from the direction which I came, the Jewish camp was on the right side, they were wearing these striped clothes. NARRATOR: Ahlem concentration camp near Hannover. Prisoners who could walk were removed before American troops entered Hannover. The others were left to starve and die. KISSINGER: Well, the Ahlem concentration camp was, well, we, I hadn't seen a concentration camp before, obviously not, and I had not seen prisoners like this before. NARRATOR: Some of the inmates are too weak to leave their bunks or even eat. The victims relate the atrocity story, and photographs are made. KISSINGER: The Jews were in a state you couldn't describe as human. They were extremely weak. They lived in wooden sheds where three or four people were living on one board. And there were several dead bodies lying around. So, the immediate instinct was to feed them. And I and my colleagues gave them our rations. And we killed some of them by giving them solid food, which they could no longer digest. It was a world of... ...of shocking incongruities. Many members of my family and about 70% of the people with whom I went to school died in concentration camps. So that is something one cannot forget. My obligation was to contribute to something that would prevent that from happening again. I don't go around the world preaching to people to be good. But I do believe in absolute values that should not be violated. FERGUSON: This gets to the heart of some very fundamental questions about the role of morality in foreign policy. Was it simply a necessary evil for the United States in the context of the Cold War in the 1970s, to deal with regimes like Pinochet's Chile even when, as you yourself have written, they exceeded acceptable moral norms in their domestic policy? Can you talk about that general problem of having dealings with dictators? KISSINGER: Can we stop this for one second? In September 1970, the Marxist Salvador Allende was campaigning for the presidency in Chile. There was a fear, which, incidentally, all the documents demonstrate was correct, that Allende was very closely tied to the Soviet Union and that he was very closely tied to Cuba. [crowd chanting] [speaking Spanish] established in Santiago. And I believe that any fair student of the subject will recognize that Allende was, if anything, to the left of the Communist party, because he had no patience. This was the assessment of the Chilean issue. But I won't go any deeper into the Chilean issue, incidentally. Suddenly we're told Allende is going to win the election. So, in the middle of a crisis, the President gave an order directly to the Central Intelligence Agency. [teletype machine] What we attempted to get done and what Nixon basically did was to give an order that something should be done. Suddenly we are told Allende is going to win the election. [crowd chanting "Allende"] In the end, the plan failed, and Allende was elected. After that, Nixon was absolutely outraged. Suddenly, people come, walk in and tell him there's a Communist government in Santiago. Once Allende was elected, the United States made no direct effort to overthrow him. The only thing we did was to get some money to parties and newspapers that were being suppressed by Allende. [speaking Spanish] in September 1973, was the US government— were you—involved? KISSINGER: We had nothing to do with the military coup, and every investigation has found that. DAVID ATLEE PHILIPS: We and the US government would much prefer for that coup not to have taken place so there could have been elections. MAN: Were you aware that a coup was about to take place? PHILIPS: I'm sorry? FERGUSON: When the coup did happen, which I suppose you and President Nixon must have welcomed... KISSINGER: Absolutely. FERGUSON: You certainly weren't sorry when he went. KISSINGER: No. FERGUSON: ...nor was President Nixon. KISSINGER: Neither of us were sorry. One has to understand that all of this was occurring while various regions of the world were in turmoil, where the Soviet Union would be tempted by its ideology and its power to play a shaping role. The fundamental problem was how to deal with Soviet aggression and at the same time reduce the threat of nuclear annihilation. So I believed it was essential to have a dialogue with the Soviet leaders. The Soviet leaders were products of the purges, advancing up the ranks when Stalin exterminated their fathers. So they had lived under conditions of almost abject terror. So, in a way, they were like extinct volcanoes. What made the Russian leaders humanly somewhat vulnerable was the enormous desire to be recognized as equals. And to be recognized as being able to live up to Western economic standards. [singing in Russian] KISSINGER: Brezhnev invited us to Zavidovo, which is a hunting retreat in which he had a rather elaborate house. He asked me how much that hunting lodge would cost in the United States. So I said $400,000, which sounded like a lot to me. And I could see that Brezhnev was crestfallen. Then one of my associates said, "Why don't you say that the whole complex would cost several million?" And when I did that, Brezhnev brightened considerably, and there was in Brezhnev this element of insecurity. [gunshot] [man speaking Russian] KISSINGER: Brezhnev ran a massive operation, over which he was sort of losing control. He knew it wasn't working properly. He knew he wanted peace with the United States. OPERATOR: Yes, please? KISSINGER: Get me the Soviet ambassador, please. OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. KISSINGER: So that was the background to set up the summit, which led to the first strategic arms limitation agreement. Mr. President. NIXON: Well, you got your hair cut now, all ready to go, huh? KISSINGER: Ah-ha, yes. NIXON: Fine. Wish you well on your trip, and I hope it's not too tiring, in a sense, you know. and terrible pressure, you know, is very hard. KISSINGER: Our original plan was to have a summit of arms control with the Russians before consummating our budding relationship with the Chinese. But the Russians overplayed their hand, and the next thing they heard was thatl had been in Beijing. NIXON: The Chinese thing is going just the way we want it. Our purpose is to get along with both. We want to be, you can be our friend without being anybody else's enemy. KISSINGER: All right. NIXON: That's the line. KISSINGER: Within three weeks of my being in Beijing, the Russians accepted a summit and were eagerly pushing it. NARRATOR: At the Intourist Hotel, several hundred members of the international press have gathered to report on the progress of the talks. KISSINGER: It was a culmination of four years of effort— the conclusion of the fundamental agreement stabilizing the nuclear forces of both sides. It was one of those few moments of exhilaration one can feel. Actually, Mr. President, with this thing cooking, I think we are beginning to hold the cards. [jet airplane] Our diplomacy had given huge incentives to China and the Soviet Union to bring the Vietnam War to a conclusion. It must have increased the sense of isolation of the Vietnamese. The problem was that in the end that was not sufficient to bring peace. NIXON: We'll blast the hell out of North Vietnam. Don't you agree? KISSINGER: Absolutely. NIXON: There isn't going to be any bombing halt under any circumstances. If anything before the election, we're going to bomb more, believe me. KISSINGER: Massive employment of American air power broke the back of the North Vietnamese offensive and, in fact, threw them back. NARRATOR: For 11 days in December 1972, B-52s penetrated the strongest air defense network ever assembled in the history of aerial warfare. On December 30, North Vietnam announced that it was ready to resume peace negotiations. The B-52s achieved their objective. KISSINGER: By September, Le Duc Tho was in retreat, and by October, he threw in his hand in the terms of that negotiation. I came back from that seminal meeting with Le Duc Tho and reported to Nixon, Ithink I said, "Well, we've done it." You've got three out of three— that meant Russia, China and Vietnam. NIXON: Good evening. I have asked for this radio and television time tonight for the purpose of announcing that we, today, have concluded an agreement to end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia. You know, that speech was a real gem, wasn't it? KISSINGER: Oh, that was a beauty. Three weeks after the bombing ended, Mr. President, and you've wrapped it all up. MAN: There was this positively marvelous interview that he gave to an Italian journalist, I think her name was Orianna Fallaci. And she managed to get more of his fantasies out of him in that interview than I have ever seen before. And the whole interview came down to Mr. Kissinger talking about himself as a cowboy. He says, "I've always been a man acting alone in the great American tradition of the cowboy, riding into town at sunset with six guns drawn, everybody waiting for me." KISSINGER: I was at a party, and a young lady came up to me and said, "Are you a swinger?" And I said, "I'm too busy to do any public swinging. And I don't want you to think that I don't do any swinging, so why don't you just assume I'm a secret swinger." During the period that I was not married, I was photographed with several attractive ladies. So the question arose, how does he do it? NARRATOR: "After work," said Kissinger, who was divorced in 1964, "I try to be with a beautiful girl." After an afternoon with Indira Gandhi, I certainly don't want to spend the evening with Golda Meir. His dates, whom he changed more often than his suits, found a charming and witty man beneath the professorial exterior. BARBARA HOWAR: I have three things about Henry, if you are speaking of Henry with no time to be a swinger. If he's taking you out to dinner, don't start to get dressed until the third time he's called to say he's on his way. If he's taking you to a dinner party, tell him you'll meet him there, or you'll never get to eat, because you'll never make it for the first course. And if he's coming to your house to dinner, don't lay his place at the table till you hear him coming up the front stairs. I mean, Henry's a busy man, he doesn't have time to be a swinger. FERGUSON: Probably the most famous phrase associated with you is that "Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac." KISSINGER: But it's not, it's not something that I want to have inscribed on my tombstone. BARBARA WALTERS: Some serious people have been concerned that the man who goes out with beautiful women and dates movie starlets also negotiates with Chou En Lai and Le Duc Tho. Do you see any conflict between these two aspects of your life? KISSINGER: No, Ifind they reinforce each other. WALTERS: Does the President tease you about it? KISSINGER: Oh, yes, occasionally. NIXON: Hello, Henry. Where are you? Well, Henry, just let me say that as soon as you take care of the ladies, if you can work it into your schedule, I want you to get back here to the White House. I want to give you hell for 30 minutes. [hangs up phone] KISSINGER: The observer thinks that success is sort of an award people hand you, and you can bank it. If you are the practitioner, you know that success is an admissions ticket for a new crisis. NIXON: Good evening. I want to talk to you tonight from my heart on a subject of deep concern to every American. In recent months, members of my administration and officials of the Committee for the Re-election of the President have been charged with involvement in what has come to be known as the Watergate Affair. KISSINGER: At the beginning of his second term, it was a period of great promise, but Nixon knew something I didn't. When he was elected, he had called in President Johnson, and President Johnson had shown him the taping system that he had installed in the Oval Office. He was becoming increasingly frantic about leaks from the White House. And some time in late 1970 or early 1971, he then decided that he could protect himself by taping everything, including my own phone calls. NIXON: Have you given any more thought to the Kissinger problem? BOB HALDEMAN: Yes, I have, Mr. President. Ithink it's... NIXON: Let's get the Bureau in, by God. Let's find out, let's get right on his private phone and who called him on that. Why don't we do it? KISSINGER: The problem was we were so preoccupied with Watergate, with ending the Vietnam War, opening to Moscow, opening to China, that we were surprised by the attack when it occurred. The morning of 6:30 on October 6, 1973, Joe Sisco, who was my assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, woke me up and said, "There's some trouble on the Suez Canal, and if you get on the phone right away, you can get it under control." Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel. What made this so serious was that the Soviets were threatening to give military backing to the Arab side. Then we received a message from Brezhnev saying that unless we agreed to join military operations with the Soviet Union in Egypt to stop the Israelis, they would act alone. So at that point, we had to confront the threat, and we had a few hours to do it. NIXON: Ijust have a feeling that, even now, you know, you pick up the paper and it's Watergate, Watergate. KISSINGER: Mr. President, no one can undo the achievements, none of these facts are tackled. The problem was that this week coincided with the absolute low point of the Nixon presidency. Impeachment proceedings were starting, his attempt to make a deal about the tapes had collapsed. NIXON: Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got. KISSINGER: So, he was preoccupied. Therefore, I had a degree of influence, publicly, that a Secretary of State can, in the nature of things, never attain. We decided this was an opportunity at which we would attempt to demonstrate that while they could make war with Soviet arms, they would need to make peace with American diplomacy. Shuttle diplomacy was necessary, because it made possible a momentum in what was the frozen process that would not have been achievable otherwise. It turned out that that was the most efficient way of conducting business. When you went from Cairo to Jerusalem, or vice versa, you went from different mindsets. Each meeting took about six to eight hours. I seemed to have a lot of physical endurance, and I'd sleep only four or five hours a night. The enterprise itself was exciting, was uplifting. So the shuttles made possible a momentum in what was a frozen process that would not have been achievable otherwise. HUGH SCOTT: Dr. Kissinger, referred to by the President as the senior diplomat of the world, had really pulled another miracle. [applause] KISSINGER: There was a different atmosphere during Watergate, because you knew you were dealing with a wounded leader who was suffering and who was preoccupied. NIXON: Well, rather a hard day, wasn't it? KISSINGER: Well, it was hard for you. NIXON: Yeah, well, anyway, I've even considered the possibility of franklyjust kind of throwing myself on the sword. KISSINGER: No, that is out of the question with all due respect, Mr. President. [applause] The night before he left, there were only two people present, Nixon and myself. And it was not in itself unnatural for Nixon to ask me to sit with him and reflect. And now he had destroyed himself by his own effort, by his own actions. And he knew that. But he called me in to discuss where it would all lead and what would be left and what it meant. As I left, he asked me to kneel down in a prayer with him. Given the magnitude of the occasion, and the awfulness of the destiny, there was nothing particularly bizarre about it. What else was there to do? I think it was one of the most moving moments of my life, and one for which I respect Nixon. It was not done for any witnesses. It served no other purpose except to cap an evening that in itself capped a lifetime in politics. The French philosopher, Raymond Aron, who was a great friend of mine, said to me during Watergate, when I was on the covers of magazines and very high in popularity polls, he said, "You are used by the media as an alibi for their hatred for Nixon. And you'd better pray for his survival, because the minute he goes, they'll come after you." The collapse of South Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon was, without doubt, the saddest moment of my governmental experience. There was a new president who had to deal with a hostile Congress. It cut military and economic aid to South Vietnam by two thirds. In this demoralized atmosphere, the North Vietnamese sent their entire army into South Vietnam. And even then, it took them three months to break the resistance of the South Vietnamese. I am unreconstructed in my conviction that Vietnam did not have to fall— that we did that to ourselves. For the last month of the war, President Ford and I sort of kept going an American role in Vietnam, forjust one reason—to give the maximum number of civilians an opportunity to go, to leave. It was clear by early April that Vietnam would probably fall. So then the question was how many Vietnamese could we save? So every day, there were airplanes available to move everybody out. And we would dole it out by a few hundred Americans and thousands of Vietnamese, and we loaded the planes with enough Americans to make it an American airlift, and the rest of them Vietnamese. And then the North Vietnamese started shelling the airport, so we couldn't use the airport anymore. So we decided to go do a helicopter airlift from the embassy. In a crisis, in movies you see people running around, picking up telephones, yelling at each other. In real crisis, it gets very quiet, and very few people want to be seen. At one point, Schlesinger called me up and said, "We can't keep this operating much longer, because the Vietnamese are getting too close to the city." And that started, then, the final evacuation. Is that the helicopters leaving? There was no time to think about what might have been. There was a great emptiness, because I had thought in the months before, and I think today, that we did Vietnam to ourselves. The Vietnamese did not do that to us. REPORTER: Well, this is the Presidential Palace under new management. There they are, the regular troops of the North Vietnamese army on the balcony. They are now the new masters. KISSINGER: I think it's safe to say I have done the greater part of what I will be doing in this world. That I came from a group of people in the academic world and that I then wound up with a man they despised as a president and conducted policies that whose consequences they couldn't face. The major themes of my life have been to create a structurally more peaceful world. To prevent a catastrophic war and to help America towards a stabler direction. How that will be recognized is very difficult to say. For better or worse, the main strategic decisions, they reflected my convictions. And I certainly would go that same direction again... ...painful as some of the aspects of it were, in Vietnam and otherwise. So I'm not giving you an answer that is adequate to what you are putting to me. And it would certainly be more impressive to an audience if there were some mea culpa expressed.
