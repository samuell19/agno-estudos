Can you be a marine biologist in Glasgow? (Mark) Carly, I think the idea's to be out at sea, not stuck in an office. (Carly) Oh, I don't know. (Jake) The most exciting sort ofjobs are in New Zealand and Canada. (Mark) Ah, right. So you're going to emigrate, then? Yeah, maybe. I don't know, actually. And have you discussed this with Elena yet? No, not yet. (chuckling) (Jake) lplay football. Once a week, usually. You should make it twice. No, infect, three times whilst you still can. - Whilst you've got the knees that work. - You sound like such on old man. Connor, we are old. We're middle-aged. It's all downhill from here.

That's about it, really. It's one of our party tricks. - That's Jake's mum. - Mm. That's right. - And little Jake. - Look at that face. - Yeah. - So sweet! - Yeah, he's about one there. - One year old? Where is this place? Er...well, we moved there when Jake was ten. Jake's granddad used to own some land and he built that shed many years ago. - Oh. - I extended it and did some stuff on it. - There, that's me up there. - This one here? - Yeah. - Oh, my God! Yes, smartened it up a bit and we moved in. - I like that one. - Yeah. It was a beautiful place. - It looks like, I don't know, magical. - Yeah. Well, it was. Why did you even leave? Well, Jake was growing up and it used to get very cold in the winter. And Jules, my wife, was getting very ill at that point, so... ltjust wasn't practical, really, so we had to give it up. It's a bit dull at the moment. In a couple of months, it'll all be in flower. - No, it's great. - Beautiful. - Will it still take my weight? - Yeah, should do. Go on, give it a go. "Should do." (chuckles) Filling me with confidence. (Elena) We could stay longer now we're here. - If you want. - I'd love to. - Yeah? - Yeah. That bedroom is so funny. Like, how you were growing up here... So, you were kissing girls like this? Give me your hands. I'm gonna read your palms. Let me read your palm. - What's this? - It says you've got a really bright future. - (she laughs) - (Jake) Get in the covers! (she exhales) - I have to pee. - No! No, no, no. What? I think... I think you should stay still andjust let the sperm swim. Like, I really felt like this was the one, you know? It's like when I came, it was like... It was like... (imitates rocket taking off) (imitates explosion) Like a rocket? (overlapping chatter) - I really want a beer. - Take it easy, it's very, very strong. - Just a sip. - I'll drink your glass of vino for you. Nine months of non-alcoholic cocktails. - Thank you, El. - You need to tell me what to do. - I'll give you all of my books. - Here's to the little babe. OK, for this new Carly. Fmjust so tired. Ijust, like, fantcsise about sleeping under my desk. And all I wanna eat is, like, cheese and chips. And bread. Anything beige. I felt awful all the way through my pregnancies. - For how long? - The whole way. - It's so exciting! - Thank you. And now there's only one of us left to go. Oh, no, come on. Jake's, what, like, 14? - Shut up! - You need to give him a chance! You need to be careful, though, you know? - I was off the pill for two months. - It's like me and my sister, seriously. Cross a man on the stairs, we're having twins. - No, I'm super fertile. - (laughs) It's a nightmare! Oh, it's going to be so much fun! (Rose) All of us with our babies. We should have picnics in the park. (Carly) Aww! I love that. (Siobhan) You're gonna have a beautiful little neat bump. (Carly) I think I'm going to swell up like a balloon. (Siobhan) Little butterfly, little butterfly feelings. (keyboard clocking) Hi. El, I'm really tired. Sorry. I've had a really long day. I'm ovulating, so we have to do it now because it's the time. - Can we do it in the morning? - In the morning might be too late. Oh, it's too late that quickly? Because it's 38 hours and I don't know if I'm at the beginning or at the end of the hours, so I don't know how you work that out. So, it's, like, now. It's not weird? No. It's fine. Hang on. (grunting) - No, no,just leave it. - OK. Let's go. Wait. I'm gonna give you a blowjob. No, no, it's fine. It's good. - It's good. - You sure? Yeah, ssh. Ssh. Just don't talk. (Punting) (grunting) - What's wrong? - Youjust... - You didn't look like you were into it. - What? Er...l was into it. (whispers) I was into it. No, I need a wee. Hang on. (door closes) (POUndlng) ljust... I don't like switching it on like that. - OK, I'm sorry. - It feels mechanical and weird. - I said it was weird. - I don't wanna do it like that again. OK. It doesn't matter. Well, it does matter if we're missing the time now. We can do it tomorrow morning. So, I'm wondering, maybe there's something wrong with me? What could be wrong with you? You're perfect. - No, I'm serious. - I'm serious. (she sighs) ljust... I don't think we should worry. In, like, a few nnonths' time, if I'm not pregnant, we should have some tests. OK. (whispers) You're saying OK because you don't think we need them. Well, if we don't need them, that's a good thing, isn't it? Yeah. I ELEANORJANES AND AMANDA COOK: "El Vito" (Doctor) All right, Elena Aldanc and Jacoby Kendrick Wilson. You've both been through various tests and you're here today to get the results? Can I have both your dates of birth? Mine is 10th November, erm...1980. Jake's, uh... August 20...? Uh...August 27th,1989. Thank you. Tell me how long you've been trying to conceive. - About six months. - Five-and-c-hclf. - Elena, ever been pregnant before? - Uh-uh. Including any miscarriages, terminations? I had an abortion. But I was, like, 18. Less than four weeks' pregnant, I think, like, I hardly remember it. But... Does it affect somehow? - Not unless there was any complications. - No. - And you're not married? - No. So, what I suggest is that as you've been trying to conceive for six months, and, Elena, you're over 35, you should get yourselves down on the IVF waiting list. That way if you still need to, you can begin the IVF treatment in six months. That would be the start of January next year. Wait, sorry, but there's nothing wrong? So why should we do, like... We weren't thinking of doing IVF, so it's... If you do put your names down on the list and then change your mind, you can always opt out. But it's up to you. What do you think? Well, I don't know, it's your decision. Well, it's both our decisions, actually. OK, this... Maybe this isn't how I imagined us having a baby. Look, it doesn't seem... What? Jake, how do you think I feel? I've... I've got no idea! Well, I'm the one who has to go through the thing. - Do you think this is my dream situation? - ltjust doesn't seem very romantic. Do you know what you sound like? Really naive. Like, you have this notion of this per... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have this notion of this perfect life, or something. Well, life is not like that. So sorry to disappoint you. To be honest, I don't know what we're doing. Like, you are so young. We don't know each other. Don't laugh. We don't know each other. I mean, we should have never even started this. It's fucking ridiculous! (water running) Stop. Stop. Sit down. (she sniffs) El, please don't cry. (whispers) I'm not crying. I'm not crying. I'm sorry. (she sniffs) I'm fine. Ifsjust I don't wont anyone else involved in us having a baby. - No one else is gonna be involved. - I want it to bejust us. It's gonna bejust us. It's gonna be fine. lt's...gonna happen. But wejust have August, September, October, November, December, so five, maybe six tries. - That's ages. - (sniffs) We've got loads of time. Yeah? That's how these things work. Theyjust happen when you least expect them to. - Yeah. - Yeah. (she speaks Catalan) - I love it. - You like it? Yeah. (she speaks Catalan) Jake, she says hi. - Hole. - (chuckles) Hey, Jake, look. For Carly's baby. - Cute, huh? - Yeah, really cute. (she imitates duck sounds) - It doesn't fit. - No, it fits. Wait, wait, wait. Like that. It fits. - Just... Right. - (Andrew) Pudding. - Come on, Jake! - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Plates. OK. (Joke) Hove you had enough, you two? Thank you. - El? - (Andrew) Nice and warm. Andrew, do you want me to clean this up a little bit? - Don't worry about that. - What about this? - Hey, Andrew. - Hm? This is a very nice party. Oh, thank you. (she urinates) (inhales sharply) We don't have to do it if you don't wont to. But we're in this together. I'll be with you all the way through it. (she sighs) I want to if you want to. Happy New Year, my darling. Happy anniversary. (music playing) (Nurse) Again, you come to the clinic, and you go off to theatre. You're sedated, OK? So you need to have someone come with you. We go into your ovaries, and we empty each follicle in turn as we see it on the ultrasound monitor. Then the embryologists work to make your embryos, hopefully. And they'll keep in touch with you and then usually about five days later, you come back for your embryo transfer. What I'm gonna go and do is get your drugs, and I'll show you how you're gonna do these injections, OK, at home. So I'll pop out and get them and I'll come back injust a few minutes. - (Jake) Great, thank you. Thanks so much. - OK. (door opens) - (door closes) - It's good. I didn't get anything. It's fine. It's gonna sound alien, but it'll be fine. Wejust do everything she says. Make sure that you're relaxed, calm, eating right. (breathes heavily) (gQsps) (breathes heavily) (she exhales) You've changed since I first met you. Whisky on the rocks while you shoot up, huh? I've got dinner for you, but I suppose you don't wdnt dinner, do you? (chuckles) No. I want to do this first. That's the problem with youjunkies, drugs always come first. Shut up. Shut up, please. I think if youjustjab it in quickly... Stop it. It's super easy for you to soy. I mean, you don't have to do it. Well, I was a marine for 15 years, so it's actually really easy for me to deal with pain. Yeah, I was trained to inject into any orifice in my body - - my eyeball, my arsehole... - (laughs) (Elena) What are you doing? What are you doing? What? No, Jake. - Don't do it. - Hm? Jake, no, wait, wait. You don't have to do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. No, ple... (gasps) Oh, my God! (laughs) Oh, my God! - It hurts. - (muffled) That is love. - That is pure solidarity, that is. - (she laughs) You look how I feel, desperate to get up the road. Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired. Hey, you know, I was thinking to go shopping one night after work. - You fancy it? - Yeah, sure. - Great. You want a cup of tea? - Oh, no, no. - You sure? - Yeah, sure, thank you. - OK. - Bye. (chuckles) I I'm riding down the Castlereagh and I'm a station hand I I'm handy with the ropin' pole, I'm handy with a brand I And I can ride a rowdy colt or swing the axe all day I But there's no demand for a station hand along the Castlereagh I So, shift, boys, shift - I For there isn't the slightest doubt... - What are you cooking? - It's hot. - Mm-hm.

The thing is, if we do it again with the National Health, we have to wait a year. But if we do it privately, we don't have to wait. Like, we go right away.

(Doctor) OK, right, let me explain something. Everyyear, I help hundreds of women to conceive. But I can only work with good quality eggs, otherwise myjob's impossible. Do you understand? I wouldn't advise you to pursue IVF. You've got under a five per cent chance of conceiving. And why do you say that? The AMH test, it showed a... a low ovarian reserve. Er...it's an indicator of quality and er... quantity. We read that the... that that testis inaccurate. In my professional opinion, it's... it's accurate. Elena's friends are all having babies, and they're the sanne age as her. He was talking bullshit. Just thinking about his statistics, like school league tables. We'll go somewhere else. Where? That first clinic we looked at. It was even more expensive than his one. That probably means it's the best one. Or maybe they'lljust tell us the some thing? Or maybe that guyéjust a cunt.

We need to get out of this fucking flat. (he sighs) We should get something to eat. - El, come on. - I'm not hungry, Jake. - Get up, come on. - I'm not hungry. Please. Put your shoes on. Come on, let's go. What do you want to do, then? Youjust want to sit there and be miserable? (she sighs) I'm gonna be fine in a minute. You can go without me.

It's not true. It's true. Where's your ring? I took it off. Why? You never take it off. It's not a wedding ring. We're not married. - Why would you say that? - Because it's true. And I cannot have kids. So, what's the point in us being together? We'll never be a family. We're already a family. El? You have to be more positive. You ca... You con'tjust keep being negative. What are we going to do for 2O years? All our friends having babies, bringing them up. What are we gonna do with that? We have this crazy... gap in our future. What are we going to do with it, huh?

OK, you're inadequate. Like your mum. You're cold and you're mean and bitter. And you are going to resent me if you don't have kids. - Look me in the eye... - Fuck off. Not listening to this shit. - Fuck you. - It's the fucking truth. Fuck you! You have no trust, El. You want me to be perfect, right? You want me to be perfect. - I'm not fucking perfect! - I haven't left you. I haven't fucking left you, have I? (breathes heavily) I haven't cheated on you, I'm not your dad. I haven't had affairs!

You know, if I'm being honest with you... - Yeah? - The baby came as a bit of a shock. You know, it wasn't planned, and er... wejust... We didn't have that time to get to know each other. You know. Anyway, we shall see, eh? You look gorgeous as ever, by the way. Thank you. Erm...shcll we go inside and have the dessert? Yes. (Ccrly) No! No! I said no speeches. Carly said no speeches, but this isjust a wee toast. Here we go. Marriage, hm? Marriage is not the end. But neither is it the beginning. A relationship, a couple, has already been conceived and born. Today is a... a grown-up moment. Arrangements have been made, promises before witnesses, a commitment to negotiating life together. Inevitably there has been pain... was well as joy. And there will be newjoys and... and new pains. And in the future, from time to time, the relationship, the couple, will need to be reviewed, to be reconceived and reborn. Coming back together. Rejoining. A new togetherness. - But worth the effort. - (ripple of laughter) So, please...rcise your glasses and make a toast. Vive la différence. (Others) Vive la différence! Vive la vie.

Er...l'vejust been sort of sofa-surfing at various friends' places and then... And now I'm at my dad's. How is he? He's well. Yeah. Yeah. I miss him. (sighs) And how about you? How's everything with you? Thanks. (sniffs) (whispers) I miss you. Elena, don't. - What are we doing? - What do you mean? (tearful) I feel so lost. I said when I left, I wasn't gonna come back. - I said that. - I know, I know. - Why? Why not? - Because we broke up, El. Because I've been living my life like we weren't together, OK? - Are you in love with someone else? - No. (scoffs) (he sighs) We could spend our whole life just looking for what we had. - I've gotta go. - No, what? No, wait, wait. - I've got a meeting. Honestly. - OK. Just stay here a second - and talk to me. - I'm really late. Just finish the coffee, please. OK, so what? What, then? What now? (sniffs) What do we do? We don't see each other ever again? Huh? Joke, you said before, and you were right, but I couldn't see that. But you were right. And I can see that now. We already were a family. (gniffs) I don't want to lose my family. - I've got to go. - No, no,just stay. (she sniffles) (door shuts) You all right, Jake? (gniffs) We were like you and Mum. (gniffs) How do you mean? We were perfect. (Andrew sighs and chuckles) Why are you smiling? Because your mother and me were not perfect. Not by any stretch of the imagination. - You never even argued. - (scoffs) Oh, we did. I never heard you. We'd do it when you were in bed. We'd yell at each other in the kitchen in very angry whispers. (chuckles) And then your mum wouldn't speck to me for days. She was an expert at long, punishing silences. (chuckles) (sighs) Really, Jake, everyone has tough times. We had our bad times. That's... That's just the way it is. This is different. OK. I don't know how we'd get back. Back to what? To what we were. (sighs) Jake, it doesn't work like that. You can only go forwards. That's life - the beauty and the tragedy. Jake, your mum died when she was 38. There's nothing perfect about that, nothing at all. Do you still love her? Yeah. And what if you're never able to have children together?
