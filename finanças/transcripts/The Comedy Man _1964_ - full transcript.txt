[ethereal intro music] [dramatic drumming music] [applause] [whistling] [whistling, cheering, and applause] Ladies and gentlemen, it is often said that applause is meat and drink to an actor. Thank you for a lovely meal. [laughter and applause] You're a wonderful audience and I've enjoyed my six months with you immensely. Now, as most of you know, tonight is my last appearance. I've been fired. And the reason I've been fired is not because I do my job badly, which may be, or that I've been drunk and disorderly, - which I sometimes am... - [laughter] but because I've slept with our leading lady. [gasps] Who also happens to be the producer's wife. - [gasping, muttering] - Bring down the curtain! [audience muttering] And you know something? It wasn't worth it! [jolly music] [inaudible] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [bright music] [gentle music] [dramatic music] [gentle music] [train announcer] Platform three, calling at Leicester, train to Chesterfield, Sheffield, Leeds... [whistles] Taxi! [train whistle blowing] - [man whistles] He's here! - [woman] Yoohoo! - Stand by for a boarder! - [man laughs] Here he is, friends! The working man's Orson Welles! The oldest juvenile in the business! - What about a helping hand or two? - [laughter] [Chick] My doctor told me to lift nothing heavier than a pint! [giggles] - Back to the darkness, Camden Town! - [Chick] Aha! - [Chick] The agent Prout! - Ta-da! - How are you, Chick? - Fine! Grab the heavy stuff. I won't carry that! Not for Peter Sellers! I'll have that. [Chick] Do you live here? How do we all fit in? Oh, well. I was moving anyway. Just for you! - [Chick] Julian! - [chuckles] Don't let him fool you. He's setting up house with those identical charmers. - How are you, my old mate? - [chuckles] It's great to see you. - [chuckles] - How does he tell them apart? - [laughter] - That's what makes it interesting. [Chick laughs] Lead on, Macduff! [door clicks open and shut] Hello, tea leaf! Never speak to that girl. Just covers the seat with tea leaves, four times a day. Oh, uh, remember to do that. It gives the place character. - Looks as though it needs it. - [toilet flushes] [giggling] Tea leaf strikes again! - [man whistles] - Chick, meet Yvonne and Pauline. [Chick] Hello, Yvonne. - I'm Pauline. - I'm Yvonne. [Prout] Enough of this love talk! Slaves, finish my packing. - [mutters] - [girl] Oh. [chuckles] - [Prout] Chick! - [girls giggling] - [Prout] Come and see our humble abode! - [girl mumbles] [Prout] Where are my socks? Who's moved my socks? You put a pair of socks down and they vanish. - [girl] You're a lazy devil, Prout! - It's nasty, but it's home. - It's nasty, all right! - [static whirring] - Now prove to me it's home. - Huh-uh. Over there. - [static whirring over radio] - [girls giggling] - [lively music] - Voila! Brilliant. There's a marvelous view of the treetops of Regents Park - and seven dustbins. - [Chick] Ah! I can see the dustbins. Two pounds a week is your share of the rent, if you're staying. - I'm staying, mate! - [chuckles] I thought you liked it as king of the repertory theaters. I abdicated. Overthrown by the queen. - That's a story I have to hear more of! - You will! - [laughter] - Where do I hang my suit? You mean the gray flannel suit that we know and love so well? - Over there. - Yeah. Right. Julian, I've decided to move on. - While I still have my own teeth. - I told you that years ago! The only thing that matters is a fat film contract and a full, rich life! Well, you're not exactly there yet, old darling. I like this place. It's lucky. - [girl screams] - What the hell was that? [girl 1] Help! Help! - [girl 1] So heavy! - [girl 2] Mind the step! - Careful! - Okay! - [bright music] - [girl 1] Can you give us some help? Thank you. [sighs, groans] Don't play about with it, girls! Get it in the taxi! Shut up, Prout! Go on! Get on with it! Hey! Who's gonna take these? I carried them all the way downstairs. [girls giggle] [Prout] Hey, me boots! I forgot me boots. Hey! Throw me boots down, will ya? [disgusted exclaim] They smell like ripe Stilton! [whimsical music] [Julian] Hey! Watch it! I like ripe Stilton! [laughs] - You would! - [Julian laughs] [Prout] Whoops! Cheerio! Don't bother to change the sheets. We never did! [chuckles] Julian, it begins to feel like home. It isn't Park Lane, Chick, but it's a roof. - [gentle music] - [Chick] Only just. [thunder rumbles] [rain pattering] [Chick] Oh! Julian! Oh! [thunder rumbles] - [Chick] Flipping Ada! [whistles] - [Julian] Come on. - Man the pumps, Mr. Christian! - Oh, God! [shouts] Goosed! [chuckles] Hey, they don't build houses like they used to! - [man] Give us a hand, will ya? - Give me those. Ah! Enters the landlord! [Chick] The landlord? You mean the ghost of Hamlet's father! [grumbling] Okey-dokey. The night... should have been the death of me! [grumbling] Lots of rain. They're complaining. Good evening, tenants. Only a couple of broken tiles. I'll fix it in a minute. Well, come on, mate! Come on! Come on! I can't do this flamin' lot on me tod! [Julian mutters] Whoa! Residue. [sighs] - [landlord] Get me some patches! - Patches. Patches, he wants. [landlord] Oh! Sufferin'... - [landlord] Oh, God! - [Julian] Hey! - That was our breakfast! - Well, it belongs to the ages now. [grunts] Thanks. [groans] This is beyond a joke! Gladys is with me and the sheets are sopping wet! Gladys, Mary, Joan. He never puts off till tomorrow anyone he can do today! Chick, meet Theodore Littleton. Otherwise known as... - Theodore Littleton. - Hello, Theodore Littleton. - How do you do. - [Julian] He's a salesman. He travels in ladies' underwear! That must be nice for him. A chap doesn't expect rain on the back of his neck at a time like this! Player may look like a moron, but don't let that fool you. [together] He is a moron. [landlord] Got it. I'll get the builders up in the spring. - It's gonna be a long winter! - [chuckles] Oh, sufferin'! [shouts] [loud crash] [banging] [clanking] Exit the landlord. Every bloody bone in me body's broke. Hey, Gus. Have you finished with the ladder? [indistinct chattering in distance] [sighs] We look like a couple of method actors. - Julian, if you please! - I'm going out of my tiny mind. This ruins the schedule! [scoffs] You mean you've got a schedule and a tiny mind? Don't scoff too soon, old thing! Here. Voila! The Baxter report, on the behavior of producers, casting directors, and other influential people. Well! Did they know they were being followed? Chick, while we're standing around here waiting to get dried out, we've already missed the casting director at ATV and Alfie Durand. He goes over to the pub at 11. Uh, it looks like Tommy Morris at 11:30. - Which of these ties goes with this shirt? - The dry one. - Come on. Get cracking! - Alright. We mustn't miss Tommy Morris. Let's see. He'll get to his office at eleven o'clock. Half an hour to go through his mail, etc., and then, at 11:30, he has a cup of tea, pats his secretary's bottom. [indistinct chattering] - We made it. - [phone ringing] Right on cue. Tommy Morris's office. One moment. [Tommy] Hello? - [Julian] Christine, darling! - Julian, darling! - Meet Chick, darling. - Hello, darling. Don't be familiar. [sighs] All right. I'll go to 40. But if you keep on putting up his money, it'd be cheaper to get Dickie Burton. Okay. Agents! Oh, Christine. Get me the studio, will you? Oh, I want you, Julian. Yes. Friday, car park attendant. Nice little cameo. - Who's playing the lead? - Do me a favor. Nothing for you today, old man. My friend might be old, but he's still got his own teeth. - Any other qualifications? - One. I'm an actor, Mr. Morris. With a flair for curtain speeches. We'll send you the contract, Julian. [indistinct chattering] Goodbye, darling. - Charming people you introduced me to. - Car park attendant! [scoffs] It's always the same story. - What talent do you need to park a car? - Well, it's work, mate. I tell you, all I need is one good part. - Take me to lunch and cry on my shoulder. - Ha, ha, ha. [lively music] Julian, come here! Look, I've been searching town for you. Um, a large gin and tonic, if you insist. - No, we don't. - Frugalness will get you nowhere. Jerry, five pints of bitter. I fixed a very nice commercial television for you on Friday. - No, Friday I'm filming. - Now he tells me! There's no money in actors. I work like a slave. They take 90%! Cretin! What about my dad here? - Chick! Chick, come here. Come on. - Yup. - Look, can you do a job on Friday? - Friday or any day. Marvelous! I'll fix it. - Your career is in safe hands. - I hope so. [bright music] Oh, that's a great reaction, Chick! Hold it just like that while I get us set up. Yes! Oh, that's beautiful. Wide screen. Now, Judy. We go in on a close-up on you, right in on the eyes. Now, kids, dialogue. Chick, you say, "Hello, Judy." [Chick] Hello, Judy. Hello, Byrd. - Now wait for the director, will you? - Julian, get lost! - What? - Get lost. - Yeah they should be shot. - I agree. Nobody told me you were back. I thought you were at the playhouse in York. - What are you doing here? - Resting. What, by walking your feet off all day? I haven't been in a show for months, Byrd. All this pays the rent, and the meals are free. I like it. You're looking marvelous. Flattery will get you... Spaghetti. Come on. [Chick] Where are you living? Paddington, Ronley Terrace, number 23. - Come and have tea with me. - Love to. It's a nice room with a kitchen. - I get off about five. - All fixed, all fixed! - You'll see them at 2:30, audition. - Right, right. Thank you. [hearty laughter] That's very good! I must remember that. I don't want to be disloyal to a friend, but old Julian can hustle all he likes, he'll never make it. He'll never be a star. Hasn't got what it takes. Why don't you tell him that? Oh, oh, oh! - Hello, mate! - Oh, hello. - Dullest actor in the business. - [Chick] Oh. That's a very pretty girl with the dullest actor in the business. Oh, Genevieve? She only goes to bed with stars. - Another reason why I have to make it. - That's fair enough. - I'll have the steak, darling. - You have to pay for the steak, darling. Oh! I bring back the great love of her life and what's my reward? Spaghetti. Julian, do you know something? You may look like a bastard, but you don't fool me. [chuckles] You are a bastard. [typewriter clacking] - Would you read? - Anytime. - [man] Mr. Byrd. - Hmm? - Would you be kind enough to read this? - I'm sorry. - "Success comes..." - On cue. Oh. "Success comes with confidence, and successful men use the new White Wave razor, a sign of prestige and confidence. I like my shave to be with White Wave." Oh. Oh, dear. My feeling is that your reading lacked conviction. Conviction is everything. Without it, we're lost. Who writes this muck? I do, Mr. Byrd! - [man] I write this "muck"! - Well... Good morning, sir. [Chick sighs] - Chick! - Jack! Hello, my old love! - Mr. Lavery, please? - What are you up to, then? - Chick, wait for me, will you? - Right! Hey! Psst! He writes it himself. [Chick] Good luck. He said I convinced him. He said conviction is everything. Pfft. Ten thousand years of civilization, and what have we got to show for it? White Wave! - [laughter] - Did you get the work, Mr. Lavery? Not today, Mrs. Mattoni. Today I was... too tall. - [children chattering in distance] - [door clicks open] Sandy! Sandy! - Look who's here! - [door clicks shut] Hello, Sandy, love! - Hello, Chick. - [chuckles] For you, madame! How much did you waste on these? Oh, only a bob or two. Thanks. Sorry. - We had another row. She'll come round. - Ah. And the kid's been kicking. - Yeah. How long to go? - A month. Hmm. - Well, sit down, Chick! - Right! - Hey! - Oh, not this one! - That'll give you a high-pitched voice. - Do you mind? [laughter] So, things are quiet, eh? - But there must be some work about. - You're joking! Of course. Don't bother Chick with our problems now, love. - It's marvelous to see you, mate! - Yeah. Did you tell him that you haven't worked for three months? - Since your walk-on in a television play? - I told him it's been bad. I've tried everything, Chick. Except getting a proper job. Oh, come on, Sandy. He doesn't know any other job. He's an actor! It's his trade! I know all the arguments. But if he's an actor, why doesn't he act and bring home some money? Not now, Sandy. Please. I've got a case too, you know. We're having a baby and I can't afford a maternity dress. The butcher saves me the cheap cuts of mutton that other women won't buy. Oh, Sandy, please. Oh, you actors are a race apart! You're supposed to be a friend of his. Why don't you tell him it's a sad, stupid joke and it's time he gave up? Chick! - Where can I call you? - Hmm. Julian Baxter's. He's putting me up. Well... Well, goodbye, Sandy. Well, aren't you gonna stay and talk about old times? Right, Sandy. That's enough. Now, stop it. - Well, you've got nothing else to do. - All right! I'll go out and get a pick and shovel job in the morning! I've heard that one before! Look, I said I'd do it, and I will! [door clicks shut] Is it a naughty night to swim in? Put on the coals! [clicks tongue] Bastard. With fairest flowers while summer lasts, I'll sweeten thy sad grave. See how she comes, apparell'd like the spring. - You must be stinking. - Guilty, my love, before the bar. How many bars? Oh, Salisbury, Bunch o' Grapes, Wellington. [chuckles] Sure. Give me your coat. You're wet. This is no time to discuss my personality. Coffee. Black, two sugars. - And don't ask me how I remember. - Ah. Same old Judy. - Same old Byrd. - We're getting older. Yes, it's beginning to show! A line here, a sag there. Same old Judy. How did the audition go? Oh, it turned out to be a commercial for the telly. "A White Wave shave is a white good shave," or some bloody rubbish. - And you weren't what they had in mind? - You're so right! I've missed you, love. [gentle music] Dear Judy. - Do you remember... - All sorts of things. Like, um... Once upon a time, there were three bears. And now the bastards are everywhere. [music intensifies] [gentle music] - Damn me. - Hmm? - Damn me. - Why? I've always been a pushover with you, haven't I? - Yeah. [scoffs] It isn't so. - Oh. [sighs] Ever since a certain Sunday that you won't even remember. We were in Halifax. We were doing Pygmalion, and you were a very, very pretty Eliza. [giggles] Swine! [giggles] And full of tricks! - Hmm. - [chuckles] That was the season that Jack Lavery joined the company, remember? - You've seen him, have you? - Mm. [smacks lips] My God, what a mess. Those two ought never to have got married. - I know your views on actors and marriage. - Well, I'm consistent. Yes, in some things. I've been consistently telling you for years. You find yourself a nice-looking fella and let him father your children. [Judy] We were talking about you. [Chick] Stop exposing yourself. You'll make the neighbors randy. [laughs] Why don't you stop fooling around and stop trying to dodge a few home truths? Oh! It's gonna be that kind of a night, is it? [scoffs] Well, is it? Oh, no. No, it's not gonna be that kind of a night. Come on, then, Judy, girl. Come on. Out with it. You were the actor that was going to play all the real parts, for real actors. Merchant of Venice, Death of a Salesman. Oh, that kind of a night. Well, look, you said those things once to me! And I believed you! You could've been something in those days. Horse of a laugh! - No laugh. - Oh. Let me. Instead, you wasted years racketing around. As long as you had a drink and somebody to go to bed with. I like girls! Let's face it, there are very few of us left! You'll play the funny man till the end. Well, right now, I'm working on a good exit line for my death scene. - Come to think of it, for this scene too. - "Goodnight" would do. "Sorry I called" might be better! You bloody fool! Stop acting as if you were 25! It's my favorite age! Some of us try to play 25-year-old bloody fools all our lives! Don't try and change me, Judy! [footsteps hurrying up the stairs] [upbeat music] Hello, darling! [laughs] Hello there! Ah! Come with me to the casbah, you strange, exotic thing! Sixth time lucky. - Gus! How's the leg? - It's broke. - Broke? - No! [indistinct] The doctor say it's not, but they haven't to flamin' well walk on it! I'll buy you a new one! Dear lord! What are you doing? Making us biscuits and tea? Oh, don't mess about, Julian! I've got Patricia down there! You have? [knocks] Patricia! - Yoohoo! - [woman shrieks] Oh! - Shh! You idiot! - [laughs] Chick, me old love! How do you sell yourself when you write to producers? Oh, don't bother. They can't read! [humming] Hold it! Tuck at your prayer mat. Oh, don't knock it! Don't knock it! - I've just had a screen test. - What? - What for? - The African picture. Alfie fixed it for me. Alfie? Alfie and my quid! Oh, really! At a time like this, you have to talk about money! [sighs, clicks tongue] - I need a drink. - You'd better take it easy. Easy? It's between me and one other chap. That very dull actor Vick! Chick, this role could make me! Well, were you any good? I was lousy. Well, let's face it. I was... I was scared! No, I was terrible. I fluffed a couple of lines, and I had to light a cigarette, the matches were wet, and the door got stuck... You really need that drink! Come on. Are you crazy? I can't leave this place! He said he'd call me back! Well, if you were so terrible, old darling, why wait for bad news? I wasn't that terrible. Oh, you jealous actors slay me! [phone ringing] Wait a minute! Hold it. Don't appear too anxious. Julian Baxter's residence. Who? Fred Harrison? No, he moved out three years ago! Get off the phone! No, I'm so sorry. Freddy doesn't live here anymore. Can I help? Yes. What name? Oh! - Schuster? - Not that idiot! Get rid of him! He used to do these animal impersonations for my radio program. - What is your name? - [Chick] Byrd. - [Chick] B-Y-R-D. - B-Y-R-D. - Byrd! - Yes, Mr. Schuster. Byrd! Maybe that's a good omen. I can do animal noises too. Now, let's see. I can do... [chuckles] I can do a dog. Woof! Or an Abyssinian goose. [squawks] Or perhaps a very old seal. [chuckles, barking] I say! That's very good! [Chick] Oh, no. I'm sorry, Mr. Shyster. Uh, Mr. Schuster. That one's booked for a zoo in Nairobi. - What are you trying to do to me? - [strains] Oh, right. Yes. Well, goodbye, Mr. Schuster. That was Mr. Schuster! - [sighs] - He wants a mid-Atlantic seal. - [phone rings] - Wait! Hello? Hello, Mr. Durand. Yes. Yes. Yes, I could. Well, sure. Thanks, Alfie. [sighs] I got it. I got it. I leave for Africa on Monday. Flippin' Ada! [upbeat music] [gentle music] Shh! Quiet, chaps. I've got Griselda with me. Business. Boots. Camera. And watch. Well... Friendly pawnbroker, eh? [Chick] I'm surprised you haven't got three balls hanging outside. I don't like to advertise. - Have a good trip! - [chuckles] You too! Hey, send me a photograph of your leading lady. - Get the altogether. - The altogether what? - [Theodore] Oh, you know what I mean! Bye! - [chuckles] [jolly music] [bang] [toilet flushes] Goodbye, tea leaf! Arrivederci! [gentle music] [Gus whistles] Don't get too big-headed, mate! I'll send you back a mud hut! [Julian] Then you can move out of here and live in comfort! - Yeah! - [laughs] Well... Bring me back a leopard skin jockstrap. Oh, and don't forget. If you make Hollywood, English butlers, I'm told, are very fashionable, sir. Stop sending me up, you bastard! - Good luck, old love. - Good luck, Chick. God bless. - Here. - Huh? Oh, thanks. You won't need that. - I say, thespian! Your phone's ringing! - Well, answer it! [whispers] I can't! Griselda! [grunts] Oh, my. See ya! [phone ringing] [exhilarating music] - [phone rings] - [panting] Hello? Yes? Hey! What's all the heavy breathing? Have you got a woman in there? [Chick talking indistinctly] Oh, language! Now, look. I can get you a day's filming next week. Are you available? I'm entirely available! What is it? A nice little cameo. Character part. [whimsical music] [assistant] Now, come on, fellas! Come on! We haven't got much time! Come up here. - Put that one over there! - [neighing] Now, come on! All out! Come on, crowd! We haven't got all day! Come on! Come on! Hurry up, please! Come on, please! And take all your watches and your rings off, please. Come on. Hurry up! Oh, dear. [mutters] Mind the step, Minihaha. Thank you, Hiawatha. Come on, girls! Please hurry up! We haven't got all day! Come. It's gonna rain soon! [dog barking] [assistant] Take that one! Ken Hodges. Bradley Smith. [assistant] What are you doing... Ernie Dave. Fay Trubshaw. - Hey. - Charles Byrd. I ain't seen you around the studios. You a registered crowd artist, mate? - No. Undertaker's assistant. - [laughs] A day like this is worth a fortune to us. [assistant 2] Jack Smith. [assistant 2] Hold this. [assistant] All right, now! Come on, crowd! In by the wigwams! Now, two to a wigwam! Come on! [assistant mutters] [sighs] [dramatic music] - [indistinct shouting] - Madness! [sighs] - Come on. Turn around, dear. - Sorry. Hold that. [indistinct chattering] [inaudible] [assistant] We've only got one pair of feet. We're doing our best! Come on, crowd. Come on. - Share my wigwam. - [sighs] Is this an overture, Hiawatha? - Fatherly gesture. Old Indian brave. - Oh. Indian brave isn't that old. [inaudible] Here. You're a bleedin' actor. - Naturally. What are you? - I'm a shop steward and a crowd artist. - Hau. - We'll have to look into this. We don't want any bleedin' actors knockin' about. You're in the wrong union, mate. Now, come on, Indians! Get in your positions! - Go on! Over there! Go on! - Not me! We don't work with him! - Why not? - Well, why the hell not? I'm from an enemy tribe. Actors can't come in here and take our bread and butter! - This is crowd work! - Now, look. We're not making Cleopatra. - This is a TV film! Get back in position! - This is a union matter! If you don't get the shot soon, you'll lose your light. You've already lost your Indians! All out, fellas! This set's black! - Hey, no! Wait! Come back! - What do you mean we've lost our Indians? [indistinct chattering] Somebody tell me what's going on! - All right. That's strike 2. Bring it in. - [men muttering] [birds chirping] [assistants] Hey, fellas! Come on, fellas! We're all in the same industry! - [muttering] - Now, come on, lads! We've got work to do! What are you doing in this soap opera? - Trying to be an actress. - [scoffs] This isn't acting. - This is paying the rent. - [assistant] Come on! What now? - Well, why do you do it? - I'm an aging actor. I need the work. - You're deprecating yourself. - Depre... I see money's been spent on your education. [stammering] Look, let's be friendly now! - Let's all pull together! - Let's all pull together. [assistant] Mike! - [director] We'll sort this out later. - [assistant] We'll sort this out later. Looks like a scalping party. [Chick] Well? Enjoy your powwow? We'll see to you later, mate. [assistant] Let's go. Let's get this shot! - Everyone in their positions now! - [assistant] Everyone in their positions! - Everyone quiet for rehearsal! - [assistant] Everyone quiet for rehearsal! - Now we'll try a take. - [assistant] Now we'll try a take. - Okay. Stand by for a take. - [assistant] Okay. Stand by for a take. - Kip. Herbie? - [assistant] Herbie. - Turn over. - [assistant] Turn over. - Shut up! - [assistant] Shut... - Indians on set, 37th take. - [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music] Go! Go! Hey, fellas! Fellas! - Come back! - [man] Come back, fellas! [indistinct chattering] I've never been here before. - Are they all actors? - [chuckles] Pick out the ones making their pint last the whole evening. They're the actors. Don't drink it, love. Sip it. - Am I a love? - Most definitely. Do you think I have a go-to-bed look about me? Is that why you asked me to have a drink with you? Oh, my... my dear boy. It is, uh, Chick Byrd, isn't it? You may remember me. Rutherford Thomas. - It must be, what, five years? - Ruthy Thomas, yes. How are you? Miss Fay Trubshaw, this is Rutherford Thomas. - How do you do. - Delighted. Well, I shan't interrupt. - Oh, goodnight, Ruthy. - Goodnight. - Are you working, dear boy? - No. - We've just done a day's filming. - Oh. Fortunate people! [chuckles] Mine is a Guinness. What are you, staying with friends in town, dear boy? No. I'm in a sort of flat. Oh. Hm-mm. I, uh... [chuckles] I seem to remember that I'm in your debt for a trifling amount. If you'll give me your address, I'll send you a postal order next week. - Well, Prout can always find me. - Oh. One and a penny, please. - One and a penny. - Hmm? - Oh, yes. - Oh, I'll get it. You know, you got the last round. - [Fay] Here you are. - Thank you, dear. - [Rutherford] That's very kind of you. - [Fay] You're very welcome. [Rutherford] Cheers. [somber music] - Someone you know? - Vaguely. - I'll attend to that matter, dear boy. - Oh, that's all right, Ruthy. Someone you know? Is she one of your go-to-bed loves? Trubshaw, your mind is in need of an airing. Indian brave who looks down front of squaw's blouse shouldn't talk about other people's minds. - An old habit of my youth. I apologize. - Noted. Hey! Put that girl down! She may be a virgin! Suddenly, the beer tastes of agents. The black at midnight ten-percenters. [laughs] Thanks for the cameo. What are you moaning about? It was work. - Where's my commission? - Yeah. - Voila. - [chuckles] You can't insult me, Chick. I'm too ignorant! Anyway, I brought friends. - [whistles] Jack! Come out! - Jack? - [Chick] Jack, me old mate! - Chick! [Chick laughs] How are you? - It's a great night for a son! - It's a boy? - Goddamn right, it's a boy! - [laughs] Just a minute. [indistinct chattering] Excuse me, all you fellows! Hey! Stop talking about yourselves for a minute! [shouts] Quiet! [chattering quietens down] I have just become a father. [cheering] - And... And... - [man] Come on, gentlemen, please. And tomorrow, I'm going to go out and get a job. And to hell with this lousy profession! [cheering] Come on, old chum. I'll buy you a drink. [indistinct chattering] Come on. Whoa! [woman] We'll take him out to the car. My Chick Byrd connects to the public with a poetical backside, eh? Prout, you're from the positive lower depths! Every man to his own cut of the joint, eh? - [shrieks] - Watch it! Watch it! - [Proust laughs] - [Fay] Hey, Chick. - Are we going to a party? - Oh, not you, my love. I've got to go look after Dad. - Hey, Chick! - [Chick] All right, I'm coming! Good luck in that rep, little shrimp. Keep your eyes open and your blouse buttoned, okay? See you sometime. - Goodbye. - [indistinct chattering] [inaudible] [gentle music] [laughter] Go on! Get out of the way! - [shrieks] Ow! - [man] Hey, go on. Hey, I live down in a flippin' room! What about his door-to-door stop? You're lucky you're not walking, you old bum! - All right. Thanks for the ride! - [woman] Bye! God bless. Lovely party! [gentle music] [phone ringing] Hello? [coins clinking] This is the early bird, lately known as the worm. - You're drunk. - It's the drunk call. Who was that man I saw you with tonight? Don't tell me now. Tell me when I get there. If you're feeling amorous, Byrd, try some other number. I've got company. Oh. It's like that, is it? Go to hell. [clicks tongue] [melancholic music] [groans] Not my night. But I wrote, twice. Yes, Byrd. B-Y-R-D. [knock on door] What? Oh. All right. Well, never mind. Just tell him I called. - Yes. Thank you kindly. - [phone pings] - [scoffs] - [phone slams] Those damn stairs! Well, Ruthy. It looks as though you're in transit. Well, it, uh, it occurred to me that you might be glad of company. Did it? Only two or three days at the outside, as a dear friend of mine has asked me to stay with him at Brighton. [chuckles] - Does the ceiling leak? - Only when it rains. [clicks tongue] [chuckles] Put the kettle on. There's a dear boy. Dear boy, perhaps. Slave, never. The kettle's that-a-way. Oh. And the meter needs a shilling. [dog barking] [grunts] It's positively Siberian. Something should be done about that draft. It's a filthy day. I shouldn't venture out. I have to. The roof may leak, but I'd like to keep it over my head. Dear boy, I thought you were doing famously! Two days' work in two months, if you can call that a success. Oh, well. These things are sent to try us. Yes. [door clicks shut] [door clicks open] And Ruthy? Remember the old proverb. "After three days, guests, like fish, begin to stink." [door clicks shut] [indistinct chattering] Hey, Chick! I've saved a place for you. Ah! Splendid, splendid. - [yelling] - [mocking sounds] [yelling] I've been telling this ignorant lot they can't make us take jobs we don't want. I mean, we are actors. They've got to give us acting jobs. Quite right too, Skippy. You leave it to me. - Next, please. - Good morning, sir! - Are we keeping well? - Oh, Mr. Byrd. - [chuckles] How are we? - We're very well indeed, thank you. And we're going to be a lot better in a moment, aren't we? Yes. They want boilermakers in Shepherd's Bush. And lumberjacks in St. John's Wood. Sixty-seven and sixpence, please. They want thatched roofs in Swiss Cottage. And lawn mowers at Holland Park. - Dog walker's assistant? - Sixty-seven and sixpence. - Factory worker. - Albert Finney's done it already. [Chick] Don't bother to open the box. I'll take the money. [sighs] [stamp thudding] A word of advice, if I may, Mr. Byrd. You would do well to think of tomorrow. Mr. Merryweather, I promise I'll think about it... tomorrow. Sixty-seven and six, please. Taxi! [whistles] [clicking tongue, sighs] - [clears throat] - Sixty-seven and six, please. Ah, Mr. Skippy. [chuckles] Now, I have got something for you, sir. Uh... There we are. Right. Here. Jack! How are you, mate? I was gonna call you. He wants a Scouser for a small part in a picture next week. - Try your luck. - Right. Well, wait for me. [hooters honking] I'm sure something could be arranged. I'm afraid I haven't had very much experience, Mr. Morris. With a figure like that, dear, you don't need experience. Why don't you wait in there, huh? There's nothing today, old man. Well, the grapevine has it that you're looking for a Scouser, Mr. Morris. So? You weren't born in Liverpool. What's that got to do with it? I know the accent. [chuckles] Sorry, old man. I like the real thing. I wanted a Mongolian last week. I found one. In the gents' in Leicester Square. Don't keep her waiting, old man. [sniffs] Somebody'll swing for that berk one day. - Where are you going? - Shearsby Avenue. Interview for a film part I'm not going to get. How's Sandy? - Well, you know. - And the baby? Bloody marvelous pair of lungs. [hearty laughter] Hey, you look dead beat. What have you been up to? Working as a night porter at Paddington Station. If Tommy Morris was casting porters, I'd be the real thing. Here, look. For the boy. I never did get round to buying him a bonnet. Come on. Take it! Don't be so bloody difficult! Where's your watch? - Being mended. - So, put it away. Look, Jack. We've both been actors all our working lives. You're looking at 40. I've seen it. And we're skint. But that's the way it's always been! We didn't join this business for checkbooks and suburban gardens. A year from now, we'll have our names up in lights. You're a good actor. You'll make it. Don't you give me that crap. Hey, come on! - [gentle music] - [footsteps coming up stairs] Alas, poor Yorick! Comfortable? [radio static] It's a bit rowdy here, boy. Yes. The radio prophecies a white Christmas. [gentle music] [clears throat] Things are a bit tight at the moment. At the, uh, Public Assistance, I was obliged to say that you were charging me rent. Oh. Well, two guineas a week. - Thanks for letting me know. - [sighs] Oh, I nearly forgot. Uh, there was a message. Your friend Prout wants to know if you'll be free Christmas week. Sounds like work, dear boy! Time to visit the third floor! Toy fair on the third floor! Visit the toy fair on the third floor! [Chick] That'll do. That'll do. That'll do. That'll do, yes. That'll do. Now, watch it! Watch it! - [laughter] - [crying] Careful now. Okay, mate. Clear out. Watch the little bastards. It's murder. [crying] [church bells tolling] [coughing] Cuts through me like a knife! [sniffs] This mania of yours for fresh air will be the death of me! [coughing] Oh, I'm not complaining, dear boy, but eggs and bacon is strange Christmas fare, wouldn't you say? Not what you've been used to. In my great days, I had as many as 50 guests to spend the Yuletide season. Now, I'm an old man. Outside, the world is celebrating, and you and I are garroted in this third-floor stable. Well, I like this place. It's a sieve that lets in the wind and the rain. I've just about had a bellyful of you, Ruthy. Goodwill to all men. I know. It comes but once a year. I suppose I ought to wait till tomorrow to say this. I'm just about sick to death of you lying in bed, your complaints, and this room looking like a junk shop! So much for friendship. You were never a friend of mine, Ruthy. You're an acquaintance, who's done nothing to find a job since he's been here! We've all got to stand on our own two feet, and if a man can't win, at least he can have a bloody good go. It comes as no surprise, dear boy. I felt the chill wind of discontent for some days. [grunts] You better leave here shortly. Because if you call me "dear boy" just once more, so help me, I'll crack you across your venerable old head with a cook hammer. [sighs] [Prout] I put him in pictures, told the world he'd be a star. - [Chick] Yes, I remember. - Does he call me now he's back? Oh, I despise actors! Prout, look. I need work badly. Isn't there any chance of a job? A real job, anywhere? Well, what about a temporary job? You know, I've got some very good connections outside of the profession. [scoffs] It's a pity you haven't got a few more inside. No more temporary jobs. No more feathers or beards. They're out! The only thing I have to sell is whatever small talent I may have as an actor. But Gus Sloppitt's crying for his rent! After all, the man has a case. In my day, Gus had to wait his turn. Don't spoil him. Thanks, Prout. You've been a great help. I didn't have to be in this racket! I could've owned a sweet shop in Strettle! No comment. I don't know how you live, Mr. Byrd. Really, I don't. That makes two of us. - [typewriters clacking] - Never do for me, your sort of lot. How long is it since you've worked? [clicks tongue] Christmas. I couldn't do it, Mr. Byrd. I like things regular. I like to know where I stand. Steady pay packet, pension scheme, nice little house. - Semi-detached. - Mortgaged? Be paid off by the time I leave here. That's what I call achievement, Mr. Byrd. Something to be proud of, in my opinion. Summer holidays, regular. I always go to Bournemouth, fourth week of July, rain or fine, [chuckles] and it's usually fine in Bournemouth. If I worked a week here and a week there, I'd never get to Bournemouth, and I regard that time as the highlight of the year, Mr. Byrd. Well, if we all thought like you did, Mr. Merryweather, you'd never get into Bournemouth, would you? It's a nice place, Bournemouth. The air's so invigorating. [lively music] [chuckles] I put me back out! You put yourself out too, I see! It wasn't that I was absconding, dear boy, and the matter of the rent will be attended to. Shall I hold the taxi for you? No. No, thank you. I have my own mode of transport. Thank you, dear boy. - [lively music] - [train horn blaring] Tut, tut! Thank you. [brakes screech] Hurry, dear boy! Conductor, would you stow my traps, please? - Ruthy, if you've nowhere to go... - But I have, dear boy. Train's at St. John's Wood. In the summer, I shall go to Brighton. Thank you. Take that. [grunts] My final advice to you is to get out of that death trap as soon as possible. - All fares now, cap. - Thank you, conductor. - [bell rings] - A fond farewell. [gentle music] [rain pattering] - Gus? - [Gus] Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello! [Gus] Hello! Haven't you paid the electric light bill? I owe them 20 quid and they can't get blood out of a stone. But why don't you cough up? You owe me four weeks Saturday. Because I'm skint through feeding that nymphomaniac gas meter of yours! - [Chick] It's insatiable! - Who's insatiable? [woman] Hello? Take care of your own meter. [Gus] Why don't you give up this acting lark before you end up permanent in that poor house? [Chick] Oh, get lost! Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy. [music intensifies] [music subdues] Ring, you bastard, ring! [footsteps tapping] [water running] [knocking on door] [train horn blaring] I'm sorry. I don't want any encyclopedias today. It's obviously late and inconvenient, madam. - I'll call again tomorrow. - Don't be a fool. Come in. - Silly question. Have you eaten? - Breakfast. - Three days ago. - All right. Pour us both out a sherry if you can stand it. - You're in luck. I'm cooking a steak. - Hey, what about that! There's a lot of room at the bottom, isn't there? I have 142 letters to prove it. You spent too long in small companies choosing the parts you wanted to play. Maybe. It's enough of a jungle down here when you're 20 or 30. At 40, it gets to be something else, doesn't it? I'll tell you what it gets to be. A fatal time when you have to get a job, and it shows. You carry your failure around with you, here, on your shoulder, like a small black ape. You try to pretend it isn't there. But they know and you know. In the end, it defeats you. And you go after work, knowing you're not going to get it. Nothing feigns like faith. I could even say "White Wave Razor" with conviction now. But nobody's asking. [scoffs] - It's been a long winter, Chick. - Aye. Winter of my discontent. You're slipping, chum. Your quotes aren't even funny anymore. Come on. Ah! All right? I should have married you years ago. - [chuckles] - Correction. Still the comedy man. [chuckles] Silly question number two. - Have you got any money? - Well, that is a bloody silly question. - Then, will you do something for me? - Like what? Like let me lend you some. Laugh line coming up. I never take money from a woman. I'm Judy, remember? I... I ought to be protesting. Just don't take a lot of blankets. Blankets! Those were the days. [gentle music] [sighs] [groans] [dramatic music] [softly] Jack. Why... Go away, Chick. [softly] Sandy. [children shouting indistinctly in the distance] I came round to see if there was anything I could do to help. You've done enough. You and all the others like you. If he'd taken a proper job years ago, this would never have happened. - [crying] - He was an actor, Sandy! So you always told him. And you were the one he listened to. - Look. - [sniffs] - Sandy, I've got a few quid. - Go away, will you? - [sobbing] - For the boy. I'm gonna take him to my parents'. Bring him up to lead a normal life. We'll be all right. Well, is there anything I can do to help? [sniffles] You and Tommy Morris. [sniffs] Everyone wants to help now! [sobbing] [door slams shut] She don't cry until that man ring up and have a job for Mr. Lavery. God. When? - Couple of hours ago. - [sighs] She don't cry until then. Please, you go now. [melancholic music] [inspirational music] Where do you think you're going? Yes, old man? You offered Jack Lavery a job this morning. Terrible thing, that. Sad for his wife. Has the part been taken yet? You're quick off the mark. Somebody's going to get the job. Why not me? You don't even know yet what the job is, old man. I may not be a genuine Mongolian from the lavatory in Leicester Square, but I'll play anything else you have to offer. Anything? I'll take the part you had for Jack. What I had for Jack was a commercial. [sniffs] - Have you got Tony Robbins yet? - Not yet, Mr. Morris. - Shall I try him? - No. Hang on a moment. I seem to remember that you used to throw up at the idea of commercials. I've got a stronger stomach now. - [airplane engine whirring] - Running into a storm front, skipper! - We'll have to lose height! - No, Tom. We're going up and over. Full revs and boosts. Sylvia? - Warn the passengers. We'll ride it out. - Right, skipper. Here we go. Well, we're over. - Your controls, Tom. - Nice work, skipper. - Honey Breath? - Ah! Thanks, Sylvia. [chuckles] My crew agrees with me. Honey Breath is the new taste sensation that keeps your breath sweet and pure. I've got a date in New York... thanks to Honey Breath. Cut! Print it. [director] Print it! Save the rain. - [bell ringing] - [indistinct chattering] [printer chugging] I'm sorry, Jack. Well, that's it, then. [sighs] - All right. See you then. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Ah, spot on, Chick. I liked it. Nice to have a real actor on one of these. Makes a change! Thank you. - One watch, one ring. - Oh. One watch, one ring. - Two pounds. - Thank you. - Uh... Say, thespian. - Hm-mm. - Who's the smasher you've got upstairs? - What? Whoa! [light music in distance] [train rumbling] - What are you doing here? - [train horn blaring] [scoffs] You're supposed to say hello. All right. Hello. Hello. Having got that over with, what are you doing here? [bright music] - Sorry. I thought that... - Now wait a minute, shrimp. You just can't walk into an Englishman's castle and expect him to greet you with open arms, now, can you? Can't I? At least we could talk about it over a cup of tea, if this is an Englishman's castle. Are you sure you can make a cup of tea? Beautifully. [indistinct chattering] - [Fay] Hello. - Hm? Oh, my dear boy! And Miss Trubshaw, isn't it? - That's right. - Hello, Ruthy. How are things? Oh, infinitely better. I'm with the BBC Repertory. - Allow me to buy you a drink. - Eh? I believe you prefer brandy, my boy? - Well, yes. Brandy. - [chuckles] You, my dear? Oh. [chuckles] I'll have a gin and tonic, please. Gin and tonic. Oh, yes. There's just one other matter. [chuckles] The rest will follow. That's two long shots in one day. - The day isn't over yet. - Really? - Good grief! Will you put that away? - [mutters] [chuckles] Keep the change. God bless, my dears. Well, I must away to my chums in the corner. Thank you very much for the drink, Mr. Thomas. Uh, yes. Good health, Ruthy. And about the rest of the money... Well, we'll call it square. Dear boy! You're too kind. This is ridiculous, shrimp! - Do you always travel with a toothbrush? - No. Never before. That's what I thought. Are you embarrassed because I'm a virgin? Will you shut up? Well, Joan of Arc was a virgin, and look what happened to her! I can't make up my mind whether you're an innocent abroad or a thousand years old. I'm a thousand years old. I haven't had the initiative taken from me since I was wrestled onto the sofa by a leading lady at the age of 15. - Well, how old are you now? - Thirty. - Forty-one. - Well... When you're 81, I'll be 60. I'll drink to that. Are we going? Out of here. - Are you taking me to bed and breakfast? - Speak up. They didn't all hear you. - Oh. Are you taking me... - Come on. - Chick? - Mmm? [Fay] We ought to start learning things about one another. Oh. Okay, rapidly... [giggles] That's not what I meant. [silly sounds] - Stop that! I'm ticklish! - [giggles] You see? One thing I've found out already. Seriously. Have you any strong political views or strange religious beliefs? Only belief that we live and work in a skittle alley world, little shrimp, peopled by lunatics. Well, they're not so lunatic if they want you to work for them. I've read your press cuttings. Any man who believes his own press cuttings is an idiot. I'll bet even you had good notices in that rep. - But I deserved them! - Oh... [grumbles] Have you always been an actor? [sighs] Ever since I walked in the rain as a boy, spouting Henry V to get rid of a Norfolk dialect. But why? That's the big question. Don't you know the answer? There are hundreds of answers. I love the power one has to control people's emotions. I love the courage of actors, the fear they hide with ridiculous conceits. I love the comradeship, the humor. Oh, my God! How I love that humor. [chuckles] We're a wicked bunch of bastards, but we're not smug, and not many of us are hypocrites. Cue for violins. Oh? No violins? All right. I'll change the subject. What books do you read? Hey! You're a right little interrogator! No books. Playboy magazine. What about music? - Underneath the Arches, Flanagan & Allen. - Ah. Art? Uh... Picasso's blue period. It's, uh, more surrealistic than his later Cubist work. Eh? [giggles] Don't worry, shrimp. This isn't going to be an intellectual relationship. That's good. [lips smacking] [water running] Morning, thespian. [train horn blaring] Oh, really, thespian? Look at the state of this place! If we're both gonna share this kitchen amicably, you must do your share of the washing up as well. And you've been at my tea again! [mutters] Actors. Vagabonds, more like. Good morning. [water draining] [door clicks shut] [priest] ...fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen. [birds chirping] [softly] Chick. Thank you for coming. [actor] Out... [actor] Out, brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. [director] Thank you. We'll let you know. Next, please! [actor 2] I will do an abbreviated speech from Cyrano de Bergerac. [Chick] Your secretary telephoned. She said you wanted to see me. - Are you casting for a play? - I'm just helping out, old man. No. The agency called. They have exciting news for you. They've offered 26 Honey Breath commercials. Commercials? Honey Breath. They pay very good money, my dear Chick. Oh, not this, old man. It's not for you. Call around at the office after lunch. Have a look at this, won't you? [actor 3] Shall I scratch the back of every swine that puts up gold for me, tickle the horns of Mammon with my left hand whilst the right, too proud to know his owner's doing, takes in the fee? No, thank you. Shall I use the fire God has given me to burn incense all day long under the nose of wood and stone? No, thank you. Calculate, scheme, be afraid, seek introductions, favors, influences? No, I thank you, and again, I thank you! But... to sing, to laugh... - I'm sorry. I've tried. - [director] That's all right. Carry on. - To sing, to laugh, to dream... - [actor] To sing, to laugh... - To walk in my own way and be alone. - [actor] ...walk in my own way and be alone. - Free, - Free, [both] with an eye to see things as they really are. [Chick] Yet... - with all modesty to say... - [actor] Yet with all modesty... - my soul be satisfied with flowers, - to say my soul - with fruit, with weeds, even. - Satisfied with flowers, with fruit... But gather them in the one garden you may call your own. - [lively music] - [assistant] "The Water Skier," take one! # Honey Breath, Honey Breath Don't forget your Honey Breath # # Life will be sweeter With Honey Breath! # Cut! - All right. Print it! - [bell ringing] Thanks, chaps. [Chick] One of these days, I'll take up this flipping sport. [chuckles] # Life will be sweeter With Honey Breath! # Oh! Saboteur! You shouldn't come sneaking up on me like that. - [moans] Do you like it? - Smashing. - Have you had a good day? - Big day. I've just signed to do 26 Honey Breath commercials. Chick! How marvelous! Uh... You know, when Tommy Morris rang, I knew it was something special! Special? They pay fabulously! You're pleased, aren't you? - Yes, I'm pleased. - [knock on door] [chuckles] Oh, uh... I was wondering if you were home, thespian. Could I borrow a cup of sugar? [Chick] Help yourself. You actors have a marvelous time, don't you? Still resting, are you? No, I'm working. Oh? Comedy or drama? Farce. [bright music] [assistant] Honey Breath number six, "The Compartment", take one! [upbeat music] # Honey Breath, Honey Breath Don't forget your Honey Breath # # Life will be sweeter With Honey Breath! # I say, is that a Honey Breath? Mind if I take two? One for later. Nowadays, people on my train talk to me, thanks to Honey Breath. [gulps] - Cut! Chick, what's wrong? - [bell ringing] I've swallowed the bloody thing! [lively music] # Honey Breath, Honey Breath Don't forget your Honey Breath # En garde! # Life will be sweeter With Honey Breath! # Touch?, for Honey Breath! En garde! # Life will be sweeter With Honey Breath! # [indistinct chattering] Thanks, Mr. Honey Breath. Thanks, Wally. - There's fame for you. - Eh? Oh. [gentle piano music] One gambling debt, repaid. Gambling debt? Well, it was a gamble if you'd ever get it back or not. Oh. [chuckles] This has an air of finality about it. Judy. I've decided to do you a favor. I'm not going to call you anymore. You'd have to call long distance. Hmm? I'm joining the rep in Wolverhampton. Wasn't it you who once said it's better to be on a stage, no matter how small, than sitting around coffee bars in London? You think I've made a right old mess of things, don't you? Yes. Same old Judy. Not the same old Byrd. Hey, Chick. You want me to bring a bottle on Saturday? No, Skippy, old love. Just your illustrious company. Honey Breath will supply the liquor. [chuckles] Well, I'll drink heartily! - See you at Chick's party, Judy? - I haven't been asked. - I'm asking you. - Don't, love. Excuse me. In all the goodbye scenes I've ever played, somebody always mentions the word "love". All right. You've just mentioned it. Damn you, Judy! What do you want me to say? That you finally made it? For heaven's sake! For years, I was a first-rate failure! Yeah. And now you're a second-rate success. [indistinct chattering] # Let's twist again Like we did last summer... # # Come on, let's twist again # Like we did last year... # Did you ever play the rear part of a horse with a character up front who never stops eating onions? If the fellow up front eats onions, imagine what it's like in the back! [indistinct chattering] You're welcome, Bob. You're welcome, old love. Hi, Jenny. I say, thespian. How do I look? - Theo, you'll slay 'em! - [chuckles] Cary Grant, move over! Here I come! [woman] What about that man? - [woman] He said, "I don't care what..." - [Prout] Don't you see, my lovely, - I could do so much for Chick! - And you did. I remember. They get into the money and abandon their friends. I despise actors! Well, your favorite despicable actor will be here tonight, in person. If you mean Julian, I don't want to be pitchy, but he doesn't screen well. His nose is bent. - Why don't you tell him that? - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - [chuckles] Come on! - [barks] Come on, everybody! Clap your hands... # [indistinct chattering] Hey. I say, did you hear what one Chinese stamp collector said to the other one? No. Did you? He said, "You are the greatest Chinese stamp collector in the world!" And the other Chinese stamp collector said, "Flattely will get you nowhere." Tommy, darling! [cork pops] Well, how would I know? Don't ask me! How are your glasses, twins? Come on, my lovelies. Get your Champagne here. - I tell you, it's the new sliced bread... - [indistinct chattering] [upbeat music] All right, you old girl? Flying tonight? - Full revs and boosts! - My girl! [indistinct chattering] I want to talk to you, Chick. [Chick] All right. See you in a moment, Tommy. - [shrieks] - Oh, hello! - Whose little girl are you? - I'm Chick's little girl. Oh. With a figure like yours, dear, - you don't need experience. - Really? Why don't you come around to the office and see me sometime? Oh, Mr. Morris, I'd just love to! - Would you like to dance? - Oh, yes, please. [chuckles] - Two. - So sorry, sir. Thank you. [sighs] Two great big gins, please. Four great big gins, yes. [brakes screech] What kind of a party is this, honey? An old pal's party, honey. - [woman] Do we have to stay long? - No. There's only one old pal I have to see. This here... is a rock! You see? You're surrounded by the raging ocean! Come on up. There we are! - [chuckles] Oh! Beg your pardon! - [laughter] Now then. It's a matter of life and death and you're terrified! Oh, I'm feeling it, darling! Show it! Show it, darling! The water's rising! - Motivate. - Oh! - [shrieks] - [imitating water sounds] [cheering, whistling] That girl has a real compulsion to take her clothes off. What's that for, baby? The water's rising, darling. This is a new dress. I don't want to get it soaked, do I? [laughter] - My God! There's Julian! - [girl on table] Keep things realistic. - [woman] Julian! - [Julian] Well! Hi, kids! [giggling] [chuckles] My favorite actor! - How's business? - Terrible! - Chick! - Hello, Julian. Hi, Chick. It's great to see you again. - Well, [unknown] - Yeah! What have you done to this place? You'll have Sloppitt raising your rent! I can afford it. - See? I told you this place was lucky. - Hm. Come and have a drink. You're his co-star, aren't you, Miss Kennedy? He used to live here, you know. We were great friends. I used to be his pawn broker! Oh, blow. I, uh... [chuckles] I would've called you, Chick, but so much has been happening. Fabulous! I'll have a film next year in Greece! Hi. Oh, and a fabulous offer from the States. Chick, we never knew what it was all about. - It's... Really, it's... it's... - Fabulous. Darling, thousands of years ago, you asked for my telephone number. Well, come and tell me your telephone number. Marvelous party, Chick! I think I must be getting tight! - Do you want to dance? - Do you get amorous when you're tight? [upbeat music] Ever play the rear half of an elephant when the other fellow keeps eating onions? I rather fancy that pop it with Julian, old man. I think it can be arranged. - You wanted to talk to me, Tommy? - Oh, yes. I've got good news for you. - What? - I'd get to the party. The Honey Breath people want another 26, and I told them okay, at double the money! - Oh, no! - Well, how does that sound? - Absolutely marvelous! - Why didn't you bring her? I like her! Tommy, for pity's sake, I want to work as an actor! Can't you get me a play? Aren't tenants auditioning or Sherrick or something? Oh, everybody wants to play King Lear. - But that's peanuts! - No more peanuts for my Chick! Yes, you listen to her, old man! She's smart! Come on, darling. Smile! It's a party! Now, come on! [mumbles] Did you hear what one black bird said to the other black bird? - No. Did you? - "Read any good rooks lately?" Did you hear about the cruel farmer who milked his cows without cutting his nails? Had no thought for udders. Of course I'd love to audition. I think every young actress should be prepared to do almost anything. - Oh! Sorry, Chick. - My fault, Jerry. I was in the way. - [lively music] - [laughter] I'll call you. Don't forget. It's under my husband's name. Ambitious young actresses. Well, that's show business. - How is it to be treated like royalty? - You know something? [in unison] I like it! Do you need a drink, sir? No, thanks. I have one. You need a great, big drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Are you having fun? - Hello, Byrd. [lips smacking] Hello! [giggles] That's showbiz. You said that before. [whistles] Actors and actresses! Everybody! For that dramatic piece, The Death of Nelson! - My God, he's away! - [Prout] I should play Hardy. Harry! Harry, you're the admirable. You're Nelson. Right. Now, then. The scene... - That's Napoleon, you big nit! - [laughter] Now the scene is the deck of the Victory during the Battle of Trafalgar. - Nelson is fatally wounded, - [woman pronouncing Trafalgar] - hit by a musket ball. - [hiccups] [Prout] I shall make the sound of the bullet that hit Nelson, Harry, and you sing to the deck and speak your line. - Kiss me... - Wait for the cue, Harry! [laughter] Right. Now... And cue! - Bang, bang! - [cheers and jeers] Stop! [whistling, pops] Boom! - [laughter] - Boom. Shh! [laughing] Kiss me, partner. Kiss my ass. I'm next in line for Admiral! [laughter] [cheering] I'm ready to go now. - So am I. - Well, goodbye, old pal. Goodbye, old pal. [lively music] Oh, uh, Chick. I may look like a phony, but don't let that fool you. I am a phony. You're about to be a big star. That's what you wanted. That's what you got. What have you got? Welcome to the club. [laughing and chattering] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [woman shrieks] [items breaking] [items breaking] [laughing and chattering] [woman shrieks] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [man] I'll get you! - [woman shrieks] - [laughter] [laughter] [laughing, cheering, whistling] [laughter] [Gerry] Excuse me. [chuckles] No, I think Henrietta's a lovely name. [both chuckle] [woman] Don't! [indistinct chattering] [gentle music] [Chick] Here you are, old timer. - Three months' rent in advance. - [Gus] Thank you, Chick. I always knew you were a payer, mate. When are you gonna break up that party? The party's over, Gus. [gentle music] Chick? [indistinct chattering, shouting] [gasps] Oh, no. [shouts] Chick! Euston. [Fay] Chick! Chick, where are you going? There's a small rep company in the North looking for a leading man. - Which one? - I don't know. There's always a small rep company in the North looking for a leading man. Do you usually say goodbye like this? Only when the dialogue's going to be difficult. Please don't go. You know the rules, shrimp. Always exit laughing! - Who's laughing? - [sentimental music] I love you. In a goodbye scene, nobody should ever mention the word "love". What should they say? "Goodbye." Goodbye. Chick. [sobs] I'll be thinking of you when... I'm 60 and you're 81. I'll drink to that, little shrimp. Let's hope we both make it. [bright music]
