All right, you gumballs. Stay right there. Ain't never done that before. Attention. Hoar this... you are about to violate intergalactic bio-preservation laws. Bounty hunter 0601127, Earth sector. You are in violation of mandate E102. Violation? Charlie. Ug? Is that you in there? - Charlie, my friend. - Wow. - Wow. It's great to see you. - And you as well. You're looking good. We just received your bio-alert. Yeah, yeah. What was that all about? You are in violation of zoological mandate E102, Clause 14, paragraph 5, items 6 and 7. Huh? Specifically, you are prohibited from terminating any trans-galactic life-form if it means total extinction of the species. Oh, yeah. But they're dangerous. You taught me how dangerous they are. Aggression factor is irrelevant. Those two eggs are the last two eggs. The intergalactic council has dispatched a specimen collection pod. You are instructed to place the eggs into the receptacle in the pod. The council is sending a pod here? Come on, Ug... Good luck, Charlie, my friend. Yeah, but Ug... Ug! Wait a second. What am I supposed... Ug! Ug. Okay. All right, put these in over here. Specimen retrieval unit empty. Hey! Hey, wait a second! Wait a minute! Off, please. Oh, no! Not again! Hey! I don't want to go nowhere! Ethan! Move it. Get your ass on deck. I'm sorry, Captain... I can't hear you. 20 more days. Sublight shuttle and Earth. See you soon, Dad. Goddamn it, Bernie, keep us out of that stuff. Hey, I'm not the pilot, Rick. - Fran! - I'm on it. AI Bert... Where's your so-called apprentice? Looks like 12 degrees to make about 35 burn. Roger. I got it. Give it to me in five. Ethan, I know you are there. On deck. Pronto. Acknowledge. I'm on my way. Looks like a live one. Is it hollow? No can say. What's it doing out here? Looks beat up. Trajectory's pretty weird. It weighs about a ton and a half. It could be a space probe. Or an escape pod. Whatever it is, it's a ton and a half more beer money than we got now. So, do we do, or do we don't? Yeah. Bernie, go down to the bay and let's see if we can put a track on this. Shit. It won't scan. I can't tell you what's inside. Okay. Where are you going? Well, sir... if you simply must possess this thing, then I must go downstairs and make sure that the gravity panels still drag in a ton and a half. - Okay? - Just... Make it so. Aye, aye, Captain. - Hey! - Huh? Number one... you're late. Number two... Who told you you could wear those? - You did. - I did? Yeah. Well, your lease is up. I guess Rick's had a little too much coffee again? Rick has got a bug up his butt. See? He's gone and discovered himself... a magnetic space anomaly. And he's gotten stiff in the jock. And you, my friend... must learn to at least pretend a bit of servitude. Just like you? It's life in space, kiddo. Catch you in five. Aye, aye. Tractor power up. Online in five. Roger that. Two kilos and closing. 1500. Tell Bernie to get ready to lock, Captain. Oh, there you are. Can't you hear the bridge in your stateroom? Rick! Tractor power's reading 90 on the line. - Better get ready, folks. - Got it. Pull out when I say, and not before. Better grab it fast. She's going. I don't know if she's got the guts, Rick, but she's all yours. Give me two more degrees. Come on, Bernie! Lateral! Lateral! Spin it around if you have to. Just don't give me any new dents. Clamps are out, but they look sluggish. AI Bert. The clamps are freezing up. I got the de-icer boots working, sir. Thank you... Ethan, the engineer. Dropping. 5.9, she's steady. All right. We've got it. Okay, boys and girls. Let's reel it in and see what we won. Okay, it's hollow. Agnometer reading 35, 40, 55. Jeez, it's real cold inside. - About 10, 12 degrees. - Hold It. Um... Could you ask Bernie to go back a little? You can ask him to go back, Ethan. There's nothing there. It's just a corrosion swirl. - Bernie, acknowledge. - Is that you, Ethan? Yeah, Bernie, this is me. Listen, could you move the camera back manually? A little slower. Uh... more. More. A bit more. Stop. It's rust. Magnify times four, please. Now it's great big rust. Bernie, um... aim a blower at that section there. Anything for you, madame pilot. Look, right there. You see? It's a factory stamp. Foundry marking. No, it isn't. It's the old intergalactic council stamp. - Before they dissolved? - Yeah, the old logo. Aw, come on. Who cares? If it belongs to somebody else, then it's not salvage. We got to report it, S.0.P., Captain. We still get paid. Okay. I'll log it. I don't want another stolen property rap up my ass again. Bernie, get yourself up here. Well, somebody must own the thing. AI Bert, talk to me. Ahhh... Nothing on any of the registration channels. It's not been listed missing with central in the last 15 years at least. Hold on. I think I've got something. ID transmit Incoming. Standby. TerraCor. Third quarter profits, 403 trillion new bucks. Huh, what do they want? Ahoy, RSS Tesla. Do I have the honor of speaking to Captain Richard Buttram? - Right here. - It's a pleasure, Captain. I am counselor Tetra. - Of TerraCor. - Correct. And on behalf of TerraCor, may I be the first to congratulate you and your crew for locating something we lost a long time ago and frankly, thought we'd never retrieve? We are very grateful. Give me a break. Just how grateful might TerraCor be? Captain, permit me to put your mind at ease. Your location is just three days from one of our stations. I am well aware of the profit margin of an operation such as yours. So we are prepared to offer you triple the rate in straight salvage, in cash at our station. Well, Counselor, you do understand that I need to establish the chain of title from the Intergalactic Council to TerraCor. So, I suggest we get back in touch when we arrive at Orion Colony. Excuse me, Counselor, could you hold for a moment? We're getting some breakup on this end. Certainly. Take It! Don't fool with these guys. This isn't one of your schemes, all right? We're involved in this, too. I'm not real fond of the idea of messing TerraCor over either, Captain. - The offer is fair, Rick. - The offer is shit! It's got to be worth at least 10 times that much if we unload it at Orion Colony. We got a goldmine here. I can smell it. I can sure smell something. I... I agree with Rick. - What?! - What's that? I mean, the Captain. - No way, Rick. - She's right. Bernie? I think we should do what she says, Captain. Counselor. There you are. Your transmit is quite clean now. You do understand, we'll need the coordinates for your station. Already taken care of. Hope to see you soon, Captain. And, Captain, please ensure that no one on your crew makes any attempt to breach the pod, or interfere with it in any way. What's your problem? Three days off course. That's going to set us back at least a week. - Maybe more. - So what? You got a date or something? Well, then prepare for course correction. Are we there yet?! "Why, I'm here with TerraCor." “You know Counselor Tetra, of course. "Close family friend." “Yes, I'm the man who found the pod. "Actually, I first laid hands on it." God. You're perfect. Welcome, RSS Tesla, to TerraCor station 44. You may call me Angela. Please complete decontamination procedures before disembarking. I don't know about you, but she's the first one I want to meet. Then proceed to lock number 42. Welcome, Gentlemen. Gentlemen, problem. Ugh, this place smells like a wet sock. Blowers are working, filters just haven't been changed. Ethan, check the main scrubbers, will you? - Rick. - Aye, aye. I don't think there's anybody here. Nobody alive at least. Computer. Hey, what was that chick's name? Angela. Angela! Where's the staff? Our staff is available on a 24-hour basis - to serve your every need... - Cancel. Give me current status of this station's life support systems. Atmosphere fabrication functioning at 60%... Bernie, Ethan, get back to the ship. I want masks, backup air and power packs for everyone. And, Bernie... Bring me the gun. Have a good day and enjoy your stay with us. Angela? Has TerraCor been notified about the condition of this station? TerraCor Interplanetary was founded by Maximillian... CanceL Rick. The computer's fucked up. - I beg your pardon? - Never mind, Angela. I love you. Why, that's very kind of you. I wonder what hit this place? Place wasn't attacked, it was abandoned. Okay. Okay. We got 85% power. Two levels functioning. No breaks in the seals. No integrity breaches. Levels... Five through seven are on automatic shutdown to conserve power. And so are levels nine through 12. I got... Air conditioning, but I can't do anything about ambient temperature. Water tanks are down by one half. I got... a pharmacy on level four. And executive suites are on this level... And we can get to them. Sporadic audio, some video. Central logic is 50%. Nearly Neanderthal. I guess Angela ain't going to college. And the station is drifting at about one half a degree a month. Nice of TerraCor to tell us the station was decomm. What? Hello?! Nuclear core is reading just shy of the red. Nearly to alert. Radiation? Negative. It looks more like natural decay. I'd give her about a month before we all glow in the dark. Don't kid about shit like that. Just show me where the pharmacy is. What's the matter? Feeling a little bit under the weather there? Angela. Tell me which way to the wet showers. Showers are available... Check it out. Out! This is for big boys. Come here. You mind your own goddamn business. - Asshole. - Eh... Captain asshole. Caution. A maverick energy discharge has been monitored in cargo bay two. The station just cut a fart. Angela, give me a deck by deck scan, and read off all individuals not currently in main control. I do not recognize your voice pattern as one with security clearance... Great, be a shitty TL54! Don't cooperate! Angela... give me security clearance to all levels, please. I cannot conform to your request as I do not recognize your voice pattern as one with security clearance. Angela, do not... I repeat, do not give me security clearance to all levels. You have security clearance on all levels. - Yesl. - What Information do you require? Exactly... like my ex-wife. Anything I say... she does the opposite. Come on, open up, you bitch! I have registered another maverick energy discharge in cargo bay two. It must be one of them subsection power lines shorting out in the condensation. Go down to the cargo bay, split it off and dump it in one of those dead grids, would you, Ethan? Aye, aye. Down, please. Down is a relative direction in space. Do you require a specific deck or area? Take me to the Tesla. Please state the registry number of the Tesla now. RSS Tesla, registry... Shit. Um... Take me to the ship that most recently docked here. This is an elevator, not a dock. Please state your destination. All right. Take me to the visiting ship dock. Ship's doctors will be found on deck four, - corrldors 11 and... - Cancel! Take me to the loading dock. Do you require B level service docks... Come on, Angela. ...the B113 docks, sublevels four through eight, - for oversized shipments or... - I can't get out of here, can I? Please state your destination now. No, don't be on fire! Jeez. Rick? What are you doing? What happened to "Captain..." - Squirt? - What is your problem with me? Problem? What's my problem? I'll tell you what my problem is. - Rick. - Sit down! We all had a chance back there. All of us! But they... those people, they've fucked it up. - W-wh... - Shut up. Damn It. See, I understand you better than you think. You're young. You figure you've got lots of chances. Right. Let me tell you something... there will come a time when those chances run out. And then where are you, huh? Ethan... What do you say to getting out of here... right now, huh? What about the others? Well... on the other hand... I think I've come up with a solution to your little problem. What problem? See? It's all fixed. Hang around awhile, kiddo. I'll be gone soon enough. Hey, hey, hey! Hands off me! Wow, thanks. I almost got locked... Ohh... I'm in space, aren't I? Are you it? Just you? Better be something other than you in there. Don't move. Stay right there. Holy cow. Hmm? The eggs. Attention, third notice. I'm registering another maverick energy discharge. Angela, do not, I repeat do not characterize the discharge. The energy discharge is conformed to a type two Rendel Pickman beam blaster. That's Rick's big macho gun. He's going for the pod. That jerk's trying to rip off the pod. Ethan. I sent Ethan down there. Let's go. Who are you? Bernie. Bernie! Bernie! Cut that out and come with us. - What's the matter? - Rick! Cargo bay. Seems our fearless leader has some plans for TerraCor's long-lost pod. You mean steal it? Steal what's inside? Yup, leave us here counting REMs as we glow in the dark. Scumbag. Are you sure? - Jeez, what did you do to him? - Me? Nothing. That was the critters. I'm a bounty hunter, and I got a job to do. Just tell me who you are. God, are you from the station? Wait, wait, what are you talking about? A bounty hunter? Look, are you from the station or part of the security team or something? How far from Earth are we? Are you from Earth? Of course I'm from Earth. Where are you from? Well, I'm sorry, I've never... My Father's there. I think. Hold It. You've never been to Earth? No, I'm... - Wait a minute. - What? You an alien? No, do I look like one? Never mind. Here, hold this. - What are we doing? - Shh! I got a job to do. What happened? Oh, no. Where's Ethan? Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Not so fast. Would you give me a break? What do these things look like? - What do they look like? - Yeah. You ever see a piranha? It's a fish, right? That's right. They look nothing like a piranha. But they're hungry like a piranha. Whoa! Now watch these ducts. They love ducts. Ahh! "Dr. McCormick." You know... - I don't even know your name. - Um... Charlie. I'm Ethan. Nice to meet you. What do you think of the coat here? You... Charlie? - Hey, look at this. - Shh. They're close. Where are we? Yeah. We used to collect specimens like these. - Where? - Oh... Hello? Fran? You are engaging - in unauthorized communication. - Is anyone there? This is a restricted access facility. Who is that? Somebody I'm starting to hate. A lot. You know, Char... Char... Charlie? Charlie, where are you? Charlie? Charlie, where... - Hey! - Oh! I could use some help up here. - In there? - Yeah. Oh. No way. I'm not going In there. Well, suit yourself. Shit! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie? Charlie, where are you? What? What? Ahh! No, Charlie. It's okay. It's dead. Attention, refuse tube A442 is now filled to capacity and ready for jettison sequence. Jettison sequence? What's that? - Charlie, Charlie... - Relax. I think this thing is getting ready to throw us out into space. - Just relax. - Angela! Angela, don't complete the jettison cycle. - That's all, don't! - I am not sequenced to respond to the requests or demands of waste material. We're not waste material! - If you were not waste material, - No, wait! you would not be inside the refuse tube. Jettison sequence will begin in 20 seconds. Help! Help! Wait, wait. Look. Okay, I see it. - Lift me up. - Get on my shoulders. Up you go. Get it open. Get it open. 15 seconds to full jettison. Hurry up. Go! - I can't get it, Charlie. - Yes, you can. Go! Go! Go! - Charlie, it won't open. - Full jettison in 10 seconds. Go! Nine seconds. - Eight seconds. - Hurry up! Wait a second. - Seven seconds. - Angela! Angela, jettison us now. - That's an order. Do it now. - 5 seconds... No, wait a second. I don't think - that's a good idea. - 4 seconds. I am not sequenced to respond to the demands of waste material. Good idea. All right. Auto-reset cycle has commenced. - No! - Go! Full jettison in 10 seconds. 9 seconds. - Got it. I got it. - 8 seconds. - Go. - 7 seconds. 6 seconds. - 5 seconds. - Come on. - 4 seconds. - Charlie, grab my hand. 3 seconds. 2... What was it, Rick? Where'd you hide it? You were trouble then and you're trouble now. Bernie! Let me out of here! Come on. - Ethan? - Yeah, Bernie, open the grate. Come on, man, open it. Open it up. What the hell are you doing in there, you idiot? Just open the grate. Jeez. Who the hell are you? - I didn't kill anybody. - Bullshit. Bernie! Cool it. All right, Charlie. How did you get into the pod? Hmm? When I put the eggs in. Then I passed out. - I woke up here. - Here, Charlie. Is, uh... Is this from Earth? Yeah, it's a driver's license. See? Grover's Bend. Well, where else would it be from? But, um... Charlie, it says you expired. No. It's next year. No, Charlie. This is like 53 years ago. No, that's 1993. That's next year. Charlie, you've been floating around in that pod for over half a century. Charlie, we're nowhere near Earth. Nowhere... No. 53... Well, uh... That means... everybody I know is... They're dead. They're toast. They're history. Oh. Okay. Just... Yeah, well... I can live with that. - He's telling the truth, Bernie. - Sure. Eggs from Earth? Killer furballs? Ethan, it is a little hard to believe. Good morning, Dr. McCormick. It's good to hear from you again. AI Bert, I found this in the lab I told you about. You know, before we got garbaged. Let me see that. Move over. Log retrieval confirmed. A number of experiments have been concluded since last week. Of the hybrids, the most successful so far has been the syphalloids. It is proved the most resistant in nearly every test scenario and has a very high aggression factor. Our forced maturity tests with the metabolic accelerator have proven most successful. What is that? However, so far we have not been able to make it self-reproducing. Projections demonstrate that a planetary drop of 1,000 syphalloids could efficiently - ellmlnate all other life forms. - Holy... and clear a target property in as little as two months, if we can develop the means to make them replicate. Therefore, as all the other artificials tend to deconstruct after a few days, I recommend the continuation of funding in order to locate a naturally existing self-replicating predator species until, and unless the syphalloids prove more viable. End of log report dated 3-11-43. I don't know what this place is, but I don't think that we should be here anymore. Goddamn corporate sleazebags. I don't believe this. AI Bert, they will be here in a couple more hours. - Take it easy. - So what? I vote we get the fuck out of here now. No, wait a minute. Where's Bernie? God, let it work. We got all of the flavors. Is that him? - Bernie? - Shit! Oh, man. What?! You know... those man-eating hairballs that you do not believe in? Yeah, what about them? Well, I am reading two life forms on your level - that could be them. - Where? I don't know. But I do know that they are real close. And Bernie, I think that you should get up here, and I do mean now. All right. In a minute, in a minute. Bernie, do you copy? Get back up here double quick. Bernie, do you copy? Bernie? Bernie?! - It's them. - Bernie, damn it! What's happening? Hold it. Hold it, wait a second. - Come on. Quick. - Hold it! Come on. Now, they'll come at your face... And at your throat. - Keep this up in front of you. - Come on. Attention, chief engineer Davis, please report to Central Evaluation. I am m-m-monitoring... Oh, shit. Chief Davis to Central Evaluation. Bernie? See if he's still breathing. Ugh. Look. They're still wet. Charlie? That's not normal. No shit, Sherlock. No, I mean they don't usually turn from a fight. Or a meal. I'm leaving. You folks want to stay that's fine with me. But I am definitely out of here, and let TerraCor pick up their own pieces. Attention, code seven. Chief engineer Davis to Central Evaluation. All personnel, please return to your duty stations. - Whoa, hold it. - No, no, that way. - No, no, I think it's this way. - What? Levels 5 through 11 are being sealed due to a code 9 emergency. I thought you said there was no radiation danger. Well, Fran, maybe the nuclear core just changed its mind. Hey... For your safety and comfort, please return to your stations. There is a radiation hazard on decks 6 through 9. Please return to your duty stations. For your safety and comfort, please return to your stations. - Gol. - This is a code 9. Please return to your stations. Okay, come on. - Go. - Go. - Go. - Get your ass down there! - What are these? - Those are eggs. They've been busy. - Fran, come on. - We got to get out of here now. Cut it out, Fran. Hey, they take six months to incubate. Fran! Let's get out of here. Charlie! Come on. Please return to your stations. This is not a drill. Levels 5 through 11 are now sealed. We're here. - What? - We're here. AI Bert, we just can't jump. We got to unlock. - Ethan, engineering. - What? - Fran... - I got it. - Charlie! - Yeah. Okay, with me. This... is a genuine antique Colt .45. Used to be the most powerful handgun on Earth. Charlie, it's all we've got. We're a salvage operation. Do you actually know how to shoot one of these things? Well... I'm a .38 Special man myself. You do have bullets for it? I've always sort of wondered if one of these things would actually fire. Yeah. I'm used to getting a dud now and again. - Move. - This tln can's gonna move like it's never done before. - Watch out, Charlie. - Main thrusters in line. 25 mark. 25 is set. Nav-con is on hold. - Get it yet, Fran? - Nearly ready. - Did you do that? - Of course not. I'm fast, but not that fast. - Ethan! - Yeah, what? - Did you... - What? Never mind. No! Please, Charlie. Charlie! Please tell me he is not shooting a gun in here. I got him. I got him good. I got him. Hey, I got him! Oh, got him good! Aww. No. Congratulations, Charlie, you have just murdered the ship. But I got him. Can't we just, you know, go to the next dock over? Get another ship? No, this is our ship. It's the only ship, you idiot! Holy shit. O-okay. I can live with that. But I got him. But I see what you're saying about it being the only ship. Okay. Rick and Bernie are dead. For all I know, we may have been infected by some alien goddamn germ. So, unless anyone else has another suggestion, I propose that we just hole up here and wait for them to come rescue us. They will be here any minute. Yeah. If we don't blow up first. Thanks, Charlie. So much for Earth. Nope, there. The one with the wires. Okay. No. Come on, Charlie. Goddamn it. This thing is fried. It's gone. Where the hell does he think he's going? What are you doing? You get your ass back here! Hey! I've got something to take care of. We need you back in here. Look, there's one left. I'm going to go take care of it. - Leave it be! - You're not my father! AI Bert. Company. All right! Come on, Charlie, let's go, let's go. Docking complete. Welcome TerraCor ship to TerraCor station 44. - You may call me Angela. - Hey, hold it, hold it. Please complete decontamination procedures before disembarking. You are the crew of the RSS Tesla? Yeah. What's left of it. Ug? - Is that you? - No further. Ug... It's me, it's Charlie. Who is this guy? He's my friend. I mean, he was my friend. He is. Where are the eggs? Look here, I don't know who you think you are or what your game is... Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing coming in here with your goddamn stormtroopers?! Get the guns out of my face. You do not pull that stuff on us, get it?! What's your problem? You overstep your bounds. Where are the Crlte specimens? Ug, what...? Don't! Don't tell him anything, Charlie. It's not worth it. Someone must cooperate. You will die next. Screw... you. You three start on this level, then search deck eight. Report to me when you've found the eggs. I guess you got a promotion, huh? Things change, Charlie. Things change. Recon formation, guys. Stay hot. Angela, do not, repeat, do not close and secure door number 16 on level four. Yes! Pulsars on nine. Stay close. This way. Angela, do not close door number 21 on level four. Angela, emergency drill. Do not comply. We're being handled, sir. I know, the computer's doing it. Angela, emergency drill. Do not close and secure door number 26 on level four. Deck four, sir. We're at the lab. We had a reading here. 47, guys. Oh! They're blast doors, sir! Okay, close up. Look sharp. - Yesl. - Got him... aaah! Get him, get him! Where are they?! Attention. The nuclear core has become unstable. There is a danger of critical mass in 10... 10 minutes. Huh? Commencing countdown. Please evacuate all... You hear that? We're gonna die in 10 minutes! Ug, listen to me. You're being pig-headed. The critters are probably all the way to Earth by now. Ug? Then your time has run out. Oh, wow. Hey, did I hear you wanted these? Uh-oh. Well, keep your eyes on 'em. These are the last ones, see? Your guards, they uh... They kinda screwed up. - Ohhh. - Don't worry, I'm real good at this. Sometimes... I just... I can't quite seem to... Get it right. - Oww. - Are you okay? Yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. Wait a minute, can you fly this ship? It's probably 90% automated. - Does that mean yes? - It means, Ethan... in that ship we can probably make it to Earth in two months or less. Right. Come on, Charlie. Let's go. I'll be right there! Ethan, come on, let's get out of here! Oh, God. Chill out... asshole. You're not going anywhere. That's a nice antique, Charlie. - Does it work? - You bet. Now let him go, Ug. You can't do It, Charlie. You never could. Things change, Ug. Things change. So do people. Attention, attention. Hear this. The nuclear core will cause the station to vaporize in three and a half minutes. Can we get out of here now? - For your listening pleasure, - Gol. I have selected a music track with a running time of three minutes. Hustle, guys. Come on! Oh, man. How the hell does this thing work? Here, Charlie. - Strap in. - Okay. I hope... Oh, whoa. 10 seconds to detonation. Have a good day. Nine seconds. - Eight... - Angela, you are the stupidest - machine ever built. - Seven... Thank you, but I am not able to accept compliments from waste material. Five seconds. Four seconds... Ha! Oh. Figures. She couldn't tell time either. You okay? Hell no. We're on autopilot... Which is how I like to be. On course for Earth, guys. Better check this baby out. Can I help? Yeah. Charlie... - Now don't you touch anything. - No. Captain Charles McFadden.
