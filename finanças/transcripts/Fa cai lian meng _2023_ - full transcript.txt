A sensational financial scam worth 40 million dollars in Asia has its verdict today. Since 40 million dollars disappeared in the Straits of Malacca, the Asian thief known as Professor, Goh Fatt Choi, was sentenced to three years in prison, while another defendant known as Big Boss, Bi Bo, was acquitted. AMAZING ACTOR "Even though Joseph isn't guilty, he was accused of doing something he didn't do." What is the next verse? Sister, I brought the wrong bible. KIDNEY MERIDIAN It's okay. You can use mine. The truth it holds is very important. Please refer to Chapter 3, Verse 12. Sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Let's proceed to Chapter 3, Verse 12 and close your eyes. Ask God for forgiveness. Please take over for a bit. I want to get some water. Okay. Thirty-four, thirty-three, thirty-two. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Professor. Take me with you. Hey. Was it fun touching the nun's bottom this morning? Of course. I didn't even wash my hands. Do you want to smell it? Let's proceed to Chapter 3, Verse 12. The truth it holds is very important. COLD STORAGE RED BOX Sir, we've searched everywhere, but we still can't find proof of Big Boss's crime. - Factory? - Nothing. - Office? - Nothing. How useless. Sir, Professor has escaped from prison. A bunch of useless people. Professor… GOH FATT CHOI, PROFESSOR BI BO, BIG BOSS That's my hand, sir. My hand. Why are you so careless? Welcome back. You look really sexy dressed as a nun. You look macho in that warden uniform too. Are you done kissing? Big Boss. I'm sorry. You were arrested because of me. But aren't we brothers? You don't blame me, right? Of course I don't. You have also caused me to lose 40 million dollars. Big Boss. If I didn't throw the 40 million dollars into the sea and if the evidence was found by the police, we might be sentenced to at least 20 years in prison. It's okay. We should aim for a big deal this time. We have to earn back double. Big Boss, I need help from another friend. Andy Lau? I'm sorry. This is the person. Zhou Ren Fatt? ZHOU REN FATT, AMAZING ACTOR Issue 628 for Lotto 168. With the accumulated prize of 36.5 million dollars, the lottery has officially been drawn. The first number is eight. The second number is nine. The third number is 29. The fourth number is 35. The fifth number is 37. The last number is 48. Honey. Where's the lottery that I told you to buy yesterday? I didn't buy it. Don't try to joke around with me. Where's the lottery ticket? You told me to buy so many things. I forgot to buy it. Why? Did you win the jackpot? You forgot? You didn't even get COVID-19 once. You didn't buy it. Why didn't you buy it? Why didn't you buy it? Why didn't you buy it? You didn't buy it? Why didn't you? Why? You didn't buy it? Why didn't you? - I told you I didn't buy it. - You didn't buy it. - Stop asking that. - Why didn't you buy it? - You've been asking nonstop. - Why didn't you buy it? Why didn't you buy it? Why didn't you buy it? Why didn't you buy it? Why? Cut! - Director. - Are you Zhou Ren Fat? Director, my name is Zhou Ren Fatt. Okay, Zhou Ren Fat. That expression on your face is not impressive and not exaggerated enough. Do you know what that means? It means all emotions are depicted on the face, as if all your internal organs want to be vomited out. I understand what you're saying, but I'm a film actor after all. Nuance is very important. According to the theater practitioner, Stanislavski, our performance should come from the inside and out. From the subsurface, it flows into turbulence. Throughout the formation process, as long as one's acting comes from the inside, the audience can feel it through your eyes. Also, my other comment is the contradiction between the script and the setting. For example? For example, we are filming in the 80s, right? But my wife's character earlier mentioned COVID-19. Isn't COVID-19 a current event? It wasn't in the 80s, right? - Yes, hubby. - Look. He didn't even trim his legs' hair. Director, all these are nuances. As a director, you should know all this. You really aren't a professional. All right. That's enough. Whatever. I came here with a purpose. This is it. An advertisement shoot? Later, I want you to look at the camera and insist that this Invincible Detergent is so amazing. Other than cleaning blood stains, it can also destroy evidence. Director, I'm not going to film for such hard-sell products. - Will you film it or not? - No. - Are you really not going to film it? - No. Are you sure? No. - You'll be replaced then. - Still no. Invincible Detergent Clean, aromatic, and cheap Invincible Detergent. Other than cleaning blood stains, it can also destroy evidence. It's a household necessity. Make sure you have one at home! INVINCIBLE DETERGENT Gosh, another overrun again. I know, right? He's only a veteran actor, but he's acting like a big star. I know, right? He even criticized how the script is different from the setting. He almost won the Golden Horse Award, okay? Zhou Ren Fat. Director. Come here. The delivery of the script was satisfactory. The client is very satisfied. No need. Don't reject good fortune. Just accept it. Don't talk nonsense. Let's go over there. Look how lucky I am after getting hacked by you. Do you like being hacked by me? Don't you want to take it off? I borrowed it from the prop master. I'm going to post it on my Instagram. Let's take a photo. I already got the idea for the caption. With Golden Horse Award winners… No. It's supposed to be an award-winning candidate. We exchange views about acting. Upload. Ming Shun, are you acting as a zombie today? Let's have a drink sometime. Idol. I really like all of your movies. Look at all the DVDs that I bought. Please sign beside your photo. Are all these pirated DVDs? I won't sign if these are all pirated DVDs. Idol. Just an autograph. Please give me an autograph. Idol, you're really a snob. I didn't expect you to follow me to my house. Do you want to go up and have a bath together? Can we do that? Let's go. - Where? - Let me go. - Hua. - Let me go. - Give me a chance. - Stop following me. Do you want to act with me? - What kind of movie? - Please give me a chance. You're already old, but I'm still in my twenties. - I don't want to date at this age. - Come on. Let's get together. It's not my problem. You're the problematic one. - What's my problem? - Let me go. It turns out you're the one who's always disturbing my girlfriend. What do you mean? Can't you see I'm busy hacking people? I'll come again. Drive him away. He's really annoying. How was my acting? - It's not that bad. - Is this your friend? I've prepared a special dinner for us. Let's go home. Let's go. I'm sorry. I only cooked for two. You only cooked for two? What a coincidence. There are two of us. She means both of us. Besides, her cooking is only for humans, understood? Idol. Hey, Idol. He's so snobbish. No wonder he didn't win the Golden Horse Award. Can you stop taking advantage of me? If you meet the same person, you'd better leave immediately. I can't help you all the time. However, I'm really curious. Do you look that attractive? I don't look too bad, right? Your birth was a mistake. I'll come over to pass some things to Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan… What time is it now? Why are you still asleep? Fan Fan, wake up. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Get up, Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan, why are you doing this? Get up, Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Your mom has died. How could you do this and leave me behind, Fan Fan? There's always something with you. I'm tired of acting at work. Having to act again at home, I'm so tired. You've acted out dying of electric shock, drowning, and falling. What is your next new acting skill? Passing out in front of you. "Passing out in front of you." Seriously. Life can't be repeated, but we have the chance to rehearse. You've seen me act out dying so many times. If one day, when I finally get to meet Mom, you should be ready for that moment. Don't talk nonsense. Look at this. The bottle is filled with chocolate, but not the medicine and your lips are redder than the red tortoise cake. At a glance, I already knew your trick. Let me tell you. Details like this are very important in filming. Do you understand? Ms. Hua. What? Are the two of you acting again? Let's play together. Do you still need to act like a dinosaur? I'm acting as a ghost. But it looks like a dinosaur. Aren't you ashamed of it? Get out. Fan Fan, you should rest first. I'll call you when the food is ready, okay? You shouldn't have bought so much. I was only helping you buy them. When I bought some apples yesterday, the owner gave two free apples because of my beauty. I'm giving them to Fan Fan. Don't just let Fan Fan eat unhealthy food. She has to eat a lot of fruit. Your letters. Read them yourself. Why are you sighing? Did you have this much debt last month? It has always been that much. Just settle these debts slowly. What do you mean? The doctor said Fan Fan needs to undergo surgery soon. I've been saving up for her medical costs, but I can't even save up 10% of the amount. There's still hope. She has a hole in her heart and I have one in my wallet. If I could win the lottery, I'd be able to settle everything at once. Dad, do you even know how to read this? Of course. I won first place in storytelling. - Don't lie to me. - Why would I lie to you? Listen. I'm close friends with Robin Hood. In short, Robin Hood hates those noble people. That's why he took their money and gave them away to the poor so that they could support themselves. It would be nice to have Robin Hood. We can get the money. Gosh, you're so greedy even though you're so young. Are you not satisfied with your food and house? No. With the money, you won't have to work so hard anymore. Yes, you're such a good girl. Hurry up and go to sleep. You have school tomorrow. Young girls who don't sleep enough for their beauty will surely regret it. That's impossible. You'll find out when you grow up. You're always going against me. There's nothing else you're good at. Are you dreaming? You… You and your mushroom-like hairstyle. How did you get in? Your daughter opened the door for me. Fan Fan. She went out. She asked me to take care of you. I don't need you to take care of me. Go away. Why are you here? Dad, remember to eat your breakfast. I'm going to school. You… A prisoner managed to escape the prison in the western region last night. The police are monitoring the route and customs. The prisoner that managed to escape in a financial fraud of 40 million dollars was the Asian thief, Goh Fatt Choi. Hello, do you want to speak to Fatt? Is this for a shoot? We'll talk about the payment later. He's picky when it comes to shooting. Before that, please provide a private makeup artist, personal assistant, private vehicle, and also a personal driver. It would be best to have a private jet too. The payment? You're asking for a million, right? - Who is that? - He's asking for a million. Hey, don't tarnish my good name. Do you think I'm Chow Yun Fat? A million? Give me the phone. He's okay with the payment. There's a problem with the art team of this company. Its design and style are contradicting. Don't you know that this is the Bohemian style? What's that? It's B-o-h-e-m-i-a-n in English. Come on. Please introduce yourselves. He must be the director. Hello, Director. I'm Zhou Ren Fatt. I have 30 years of experience as an actor and have played over 500 roles. He was also nominated for the Golden Horse Award. - I was lucky. - But he hasn't won any awards yet. You're in. Are you hiring me just like that? We haven't even talked about my role yet. I'm picky with the role selection. You just need to act in a reality show, okay? A reality show? Brothers Who Make Waves. The wage is still one million, right? It's ten million. If you agree, this deposit will belong to you. That's impossible. The wages of Na Ying and Cyndi Wang didn't even reach ten million. I want to emphasize that I don't take on roles that are indecent. I'm a man of morale. I'm willing to do anything. Who are you? I'm his manager and also an actor. I can actually act too. He... We plan to deceive the lottery company to win a small amount of prize money. It's about 100 million, more or less 100 million. Yes. If it's a success, we'll share the rewards. Do you want to deceive the lottery company's money? Lottery companies rake in tens of billions from people every year. Hundreds or tens of millions is a negligible amount. I won't break the law. Violation of the law is only a legal definition. Can't all three of you show up at once? This place is too big. What we should do now is to take the illegal gains back. Other than for personal needs, the people in need will also get their wishes fulfilled. We can turn it into wealth for justice. Do you think you guys are Robin Hood? Do you recognize me? He's the escaped prisoner in the news earlier. He's wanted by the police. - We'd better leave now. - The escaped prisoner. What do you want to do? Ren Fatt Choi - Choi, Ren Fatt - Choi, Ren Fatt - We are the best partners - We are the best partners - What! The Heist - What! The Heist - What! The Heist - What! The Heist Stupid Choi, why… Why have you become so fat? No. What I meant was, why are you wanted? Let's not talk about the past. Stupid Choi, I really don't want to commit a crime. Don't you need money? Everyone needs money, but you don't have to commit crimes for money. That's enough. I'm asking you for the last time. Will you join us? I'm asking you for the last time. Will you join us? I'm asking you for the last time. Will you join us? You're really strange. You have asked the same question three times. Don't you understand what I said? This is really the last time. Will you join us? Okay. I'll consider it. I'm okay with that, but he is the artist. He's the one who makes the decision. Stupid Choi, give me some time to consider it. One day. Okay. One day. Let's go quickly. It's all your fault. Who is he? He's such a difficult person. Believe me. He'll surely be back. Should I do it or not? Honey, should I do it? It would be nice if you could answer me. Zhou Ren Fatt was shortlisted for the 48th Golden Horse Award. Dad. Fan Fan. Fan Fan. Have you slept? - Fan Fan. - Dad. - I'm not in the mood to act today. - I feel weak, Dad. - Don't joke anymore. Go to sleep now. - I feel weak. You still have school tomorrow. - I feel weak. - What? Dad. Fan Fan. Are you okay, Fan Fan? Fan Fan! I'll take you to the hospital. Please be strong, Fan Fan. We're going to the hospital now. Fan Fan. Ren Fatt, how is Fan Fan? She'll be fine. The doctor is here. Doctor, she… We should do the surgery as soon as possible. Her situation isn't looking good. Please record this. How much are the medical fees? It's still one million. Hello, we are here again. He has agreed to cooperate. We welcome our two new members. ZHOU REN FATT TALENTED IN VARIOUS FIELDS PROFESSOR WISE AND CHARISMATIC YAGOOD INCREDIBLE IQ (80 ONLY) HONG JIE STRATEGY PLANNER DARREN HANDSOME HACKER (WITH SPEECH IMPEDIMENT) BANGKOK BLACK BELT COMBATANT THIS MISSION IS TO DEFRAUD 100 MILLION FROM THE LOTTERY COMPANY Let's make an operational plan. First, we have to build a dummy machine to control the lottery results. Then we'll tamper with those balls to control the lottery results during the draw. To build this dummy machine, we need its original design drawing. We found that the design drawing was hidden in a very secret place in the lottery company. It's in the darkroom at the lottery company. The location of the darkroom isn't on the floor plan. Since you've already stolen the floor plan, why didn't you steal the machine design drawing? We didn't steal it, but we hacked it. He wanted to say that the design drawing can be hacked from the company's computer. We didn't steal it. That's easy. Just ask him to hack the computer and that's all. Don't underestimate lottery companies. To avoid hacking, the design drawing is kept in a darkroom on a computer without a connection to Wi-Fi. How do we hack it? Professor, I'm confused. After all that you've said, what is it that we actually need to do? Only two people know the location of the darkroom. First, the CEO of the lottery company. It's easy. Tie him up and give him an electric shock. If he refuses to talk, take off his shirt, record a video, and upload it to my TikTok. - My TikTok account... - Shut up. The other one is the chief security officer of the lottery company. He seems familiar. Him? Do you know him? I have an idea. Ren Fatt. What am I supposed to do here? We want you to seduce this man. Bian? But I'm a young unmarried woman. Although it's not hard to seduce him, something will drop if I take the initiative. - What will drop? - My standard. I was Miss Katong Shopping Center in 1985. I've already put on makeup. Do I need to put on more? Just a little bit. Just a little. Bian. Your gums are bleeding. Bian. I prepared food to eat together with you. Where is your boyfriend? And the zombie that stood next to him? Which zombie? This one. Do you mean that guy? My boyfriend is a member of a gang. Our relationship didn't last. Bian. Hua, hurry up. What is it? What did you say? Bian, are you big and long? Yes, I guess so. It's not a problem to last three to four hours. I'm asking about your position in the company. Are you a big shot? Have you been working for long? What were you thinking about? You should have told me earlier. I'm the chief security officer. I've been working here for over 20 years. I know all the secrets of this company. Really? I didn't even notice. What is the proof? Well, this is a universal access card. Only I have this card besides the CEO. I can access any place using this card, including the space for confidential storage. The space for confidential storage? It hides the company's most confidential secrets. Where is the darkroom? I can't reveal it. It's a secret. Sorry. Lovers shouldn't keep secrets. I shall leave. Hua. I love you with all my heart. Don't leave. I don't believe you. The darkroom is inside the CEO's office. The darkroom is inside the CEO's office. Bian, what do you see in my eyes? Eye gunk. No. Look carefully. - Myself? - That's right. Close your eyes slowly and feel me inside your heart. Slowly, we'll be closer. Can you feel the connection between our hearts? Yes. All right. Let's have lunch. What? That's right. I should eat to have more energy. We got the access card. The darkroom is in the CEO's room. Ren Fatt, Yagood, Darren, action. Hey! What are you doing there? SHOULDERLESS - I'm a police officer. - I'm also a police officer. I'm the security officer here. Who are you? I'm also the security officer here. A chief security officer. This isn't the first time you're drinking at work, right? Please give me a chance. I want to be a good security officer. Please give me a chance to be a good person. Do you want to be a good person? Tell that to the company. You, follow me. Ren Fatt! Where were you? We've been waiting for so long. Bangkok had a problem earlier, but I took care of it. - Good. - Hold on. Where are you going? I'm going to save Bangkok. Didn't he say he took care of it? Go to the CEO's office now. We'll be in trouble if he comes back. Take this card. Let's go. Why are we rolling? We have to look professional, right? What's the matter? Is my hair messy? Your wig is loose. Hua, ask him about the darkroom's exact location. Bian, about the darkroom you told me just now, there are secrets of the company. Why is it in the CEO's office? That's so random. It's not random. There's a secret switch. A secret switch? How interesting. Where is the switch? It's a business secret that can't be revealed. It can't be revealed. Yagood, Darren. The darkroom has a secret switch. Don't forget the LSD drug. Ask him about the darkroom's location after he drinks the liquor. What is this? This is a 1965 liquor. It's so fragrant. I'm sorry. I'm a bit plump. It's good that you know. Bian. Just tell me where the switch is. I'll keep this secret safe. We're lovers. There shouldn't be any secrets, right? Okay, I'm happy today. Give me a kiss, please. Let's kiss after we drink. Are you playing hard to get now? Come on. Hua. After drinking, where do you want me to kiss? Left or right? Left? I said left. I said left! Left is right! Gosh. Is it left or right? I don't mind which side. We can kiss in the center. Let's just go with right. So where's the switch? The switch… It's at the coffee… How did the spill happen outside the CEO's office? It's you again. I told you to clean up, but it's getting dirtier now. Sorry. I'll clean it up. Hurry up. It should be clean by the time I return. Open the door. Open the door. What happened? Why are you both short of breath? The switch is near the coffee. Coffee. Find the coffee. Find the coffee. Hurry up. It's here. What's that? That's not coffee. That's a moon cake. It's a coffee gift box. Is that a switch? Switch? Which era are we in now? There's no way a secret switch is used here. See? It's not even working. Look. A secret switch? - What's that? - Use the access card. Hurry up. - Let's go in. - You go first. You go in first. No. Don't mind it. Do you know how to use this old computer? It's vintage. I know. Really? Why did your speech suddenly become fluent? When I'm on the keyboard, everything goes smoothly. We've always been ready. ACCESS DENIED Please answer the following questions. You have two chances for each question. Do we have to answer questions? Hurry. What color are the teeth of Michael Jackson and Snow White's baby? That's easy. White. Wrong answer. You still have one chance. Gray? Which baby would have teeth? No teeth. Congratulations. You're right. Next question. What rises in the east and sets in the west? Five words. - Five words? - "The sun" is only two words. The sun. Congratulations. You're right. This question is designed for those who stutter. Have a nice day. All right. You're really smart. - Copy those files. - Hurry up. COPYING FILES There's even an ad? Compared to other movie ads, this is the most pleasing. That's right. It's not boring. IT TASTES GOOD! COPY COMPLETED Done. Let me go. What do you want? What are you doing? Get up, Hua. Why did you act so foolishly? You're finally back in my arms. Didn't you break up with him? You're always trying to seduce my woman when I'm away. Ren Fatt, I'll explain it to him. I'm sorry, Bian. I really can't get over him. You should erase me from your heart. - Okay? - Enough. You don't need to explain it. You'd better be careful. If I see you again, I'll chop off your organs. Let's go. Have you changed your mind? I left this expensive food container. - Hold on. - Wait for me. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Our operation... - Our operation went smoothly not only because of us, but we also made it thanks to someone. That's Hua. I didn't do much. I just put on makeup. Only Bian appreciates your beauty. - Today... - Darren, do you have something to say? I wanted to thank Bangkok… Today... The soup is boiling now. - It's so yummy. - Come on. - I want to eat. - Come on. - This is so yummy. - I made this. Which number? Hurry up and play it. You're a good dancer. How is it? You don't like this kind of environment? Don't worry. Once the operation is done, just focus on treating your daughter. I'm just scared that I would fail and burden everyone. Although we look like professionals, we all have our own problems. But don't worry. We won't give up that easily. We won't allow ourselves to be criticized by society. Well, at least you have Hong Jie. She may look smart and capable, but she's actually a kind and quiet person. - Big Boss, let's sing karaoke. - What? I don't like music. Let's talk about something else. By the way, why did you reach out to me? Who else in this world is more in tune with me than you? You have a point. Do you still remember the grocery store at the end of the road? - Fan Po's Grocery Store. - Fan Po's Grocery Store. How could I forget? I guarded the entrance and you stole soda water in the store. - I'll never forget that. - That's right. I gave you the soda water and you kept drinking. Even when Fan Po returned, you didn't even tell me. I was beaten to death by my mom when I got home. Hey. Are you and Hua… No way. She's my neighbor. I see her as my sister and she treats me like a brother. That's all. Hua. Don't wander around with that look or people would think that it's the Ghost Festival again. Are you mad at me? Are you really mad at me? I'm like your brother after all, right? Can't you take a joke? Yes, we are like brothers. Don't call me that. I told you to look for proof against Big Boss. For eight years, you haven't found a single strand of hair. Now, a prisoner has escaped from prison. How am I going to report this to higher-ups? How much longer do you need? Two years? Two weeks. Based on our investigation, they are planning a big one. However, we've got a plan. We plan to arrest them all at once. We'll throw a long line to fish a big fish. Fuck? Let's not speak harshly, sir. If you still fail to arrest them, you'll be sent to the security department, understand? Keep it. You guys had better do well. Pen. She must be crazy, practicing boxing early in the morning. You're also crazy for watching her practice boxing early in the morning. She likes you. Come on. Are you okay? Bye. Victory doesn't depend on strength but on brains. Are you familiar with trickery punches? Attack the eyes. After that, throw a fake punch with your right hand and strike the left side. Then move to the opponent's back. Twist her neck. Kick her bottom and tell her, "I see you." Understood? Do you understand? Explain it to her. - Maybe he meant… - I understand. Is this the replica of the lottery machine? It's delicately made. This is the machine that sucks all the balls up. Principle of magnetism. If we set this chip in here, any ball can be sucked up through the application of the principle of magnetism. Does that mean we can get the desired ball? This can be done by using a ball of magnetic properties. With the magnetic properties, will the weight increase? As far as I know, the auditor evaluates the balls' weight before each draw. What are you talking about? We'll use particles of magnet that can be sprayed so that the weight of the balls won't change. It's up to us what number we want then. Please give me a lucky number. Number 28. Number 42. Number 17. - Number 37. - Number 20. Number 25. Here are the numbers for the next lottery draw. Next, we must steal the balls from the lottery company. After tampering with them, we'll return them with our machine. I don't need to sell my body, right? It's not that I don't want to help, but I hope you'll see me for my strength and not beauty. People say that pretty women aren't smart and smart women aren't pretty. However, I'm pretty and smart. Getting second place in the Batu Pahat beauty pageant in 1989 is the best proof. Professor, you've made a dummy machine. Why didn't you do the same to the balls? Auditors will check all the balls. Fake balls are easy to spot. So what is the solution? In order to prevent fraud, they will destroy the old balls and replace them with a new batch of balls every month. So we should steal the balls that will be destroyed? At the end of every month, Bian, the chief security officer, will send 49 lottery balls for disposal. The disposal also disposes of share certificates as well as expired banknotes and sensitive documents. Bian will hand over the batch of used balls to them and they will give a new batch of balls to Bian. The staff will then destroy the balls with an incinerator. Ren Fatt, you'll disguise yourself as a food delivery man. Send food with laxatives to the department in charge of collecting the balls. Hello, I'm from Food Pantas Delivery. - We didn't order food. - That's right. The address is here. It shouldn't be wrong. - It's here, but no one ordered food. - That's right. The meal has been paid for. Just eat it. - We don't take others' things. - Yes. You'll be hungry later. - We're not hungry yet. - Yes. You don't need to be shy. - We are on a diet. - That's right. They might not accept it. Ren Fatt, it's your showtime then. IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE Are you really not going to eat? I don't simply give food to people. I would feel overwhelmed if I eat too much. Since I'm already here… Just eat it since it's free. I guess I'll eat it then. I guess we'll drink it then. That's right. Not long after that, the staff that manage the lottery balls will have stomach pain. The incinerator has five minutes of heating time. Before it activates within five minutes, we'll infiltrate into the incinerator. And steal the lottery balls. This is the incinerator. Hong Jie, Darren. You guys pretend to be the police and set up a roadblock to stop Bian. Then swap out the lottery balls. Remember every nuance. Fatt! Fatt! Stupid Choi, open the door. - Ren Fatt. - It's not time yet. Why did the door close automatically? - Ren Fatt! - Choi. Open the door, Stupid Choi. Hold on. Ren Fatt. We should be close to getting it. - Professor. - Darren. It's not time yet, but the incinerator unexpectedly locked. Ren Fatt is trapped inside. How can we solve this? The door closes automatically at the last minute. You must press the triangle button and then the circle one to unlock it. Wait for me. Professor! Don't press both buttons at the same time or it will activate immediately. Which button should I press? Triangle first, then circle. I know but the problem is, there's a circle on the triangle button and there's a triangle on the circle button. So which one is the triangle button? Hurry up. Only 20 seconds left. Gosh, which button do I have to press? Do I press this or that? Stupid Choi. Stupid Choi. Stupid Choi. Please help me take care of Fan Fan. Don't say that. I'll definitely save you. Fatt! So which button should I press? Just press any button! - Fatt. - I'm okay. Which button did you press? I didn't press. I just unplugged it. Professor? Golden Horse? Go and take the balls. Let's go. Sir, are you sure they'll be here? If they want to get the original lottery balls, this is the only place to be. This is the chance to arrest them with proof. What's so funny? Chase them. I don't need to give instructions, do I? His name is Ted. He was the one who arrested me before. Now that I've escaped from prison, he'll surely come after me. So… Hello. Sir, where are you going? I'm on the way to the airport to fetch my grandchild who's studying overseas. Your grandchild is studying overseas? Your grandchild must be smart. Not bad. Kids who are too smart must be watched carefully. If it's misused, the results will turn bad. Aren't you worried that they might do something wrong or break the law? Mistakes are made at your own expense. You have a point. Please open the trunk for police inspection. Open the case. My grandchild is a ping-pong player at the university. These are all for my grandchild. Ping-pong. Sir, are you seriously letting him go just like that? It's not the time yet. Ren Fatt, Yagood. Once you get the lottery balls, both of you should pass them to Hong Jie as soon as possible. After going through all those difficulties… We'll be rich. Let's go and meet Darren. Take a right turn at the front. Bian is here. They're not here yet. We have to stall. I'll call and check on them. It doesn't look like you. Where are you heading to? I'm on my way back to the office. Where is your office? It's a lottery company, sir. Help me answer the call. Hello? Is this Mr. Zhou Ren Fatt? Your daughter's condition is getting worse. Please come to the hospital immediately. Are you done with the inspection? Can you let me go? I'm sorry, sir. Please open the trunk. What is this? Lottery balls for the lottery draw. Please open the case. No, it can only be opened at the drawing place. Please open it immediately. Sir. I've been sending these lottery balls for many years. Just let me go. Just let me go, okay? It's done. You can continue your journey. Thank you. Please return my license and identity card. Why? It's Professor's order. What about the lottery machine? There's no need for us to change it. Ren Fatt, why is Fan Fan admitted to the ICU? Please take care of Fan Fan. Fan Fan will surely be safe. 65 HOURS BEFORE THE DRAW After all the hardship, you just let him run away like that. If he betrays me, I'll kill him. I'll kill him, okay? He's not that kind of person. He'll surely come back. Big Boss, Stupid Choi. I need to withdraw one million first. One million? I gave you the most important case because I trusted you. But where have you been? - We are almost... - My daughter… My daughter will die if she doesn't undergo surgery soon. She will die. That's enough. Your daughter will die, not mine. If it's not settled by tomorrow, you'll join her. I'll give you money for the funeral. Let's go. I'm hungry. Is there any food to eat? Darren, plan B.

Let's act out a scene. 24 HOURS BEFORE THE DRAW I want everyone to be smart and watch carefully. Once you discover suspicious fraudster actions, arrest everyone immediately! LOTTO 168'S HEADQUARTERS, 1 HOUR BEFORE THE DRAW EcoBrown's? You guys are even selling rice? It serves as camouflage since it's a big group. I love you I love you I love you I love you The mission has to succeed Do you understand? Lotto 168 always offers fortune. Welcome to the lottery draw issue 2899 with a total prize money of 108.34 million, which is a new record in history. What are the six numbers? The results will be known shortly. Everything looks normal, sir. It's impossible. Lotto 168 always promises wealth. The lottery draw issue 2899 will now begin officially. Let's start with the first number. Here are the numbers for the next lottery draw. The first number for the lottery draw. Number 25. Number 25. Twenty-five. Now, let's draw the second number. The second number for the lottery draw. Number 20. Number 20. Twenty. Attention, everyone. Pay attention to any suspicious movements. The third number for the lottery draw. Number 42. Number 42. Forty-two. No? This is ridiculous. The fourth number for the lottery draw. Number 37. Number 37. Thirty-seven. The fifth number for the lottery draw. Number 17. Number 17. Seventeen. It's time for the last number of the lottery draw. The machine is out of control. The chance now is only 1 out of 44. We can only depend on luck. The last drawn number. Please give me a lucky number. Number 28. Number 28. Twenty-eight. Where's the lottery drawing location? - The tenth floor. - That's impossible. I'm on the tenth floor right now! Where is everybody? Where are you, sir? They are all leaving now. Wait for me at the back staircase. 62 HOURS BEFORE THE DRAW Let's act out a scene. Act out a scene? That day, I went to the ninth floor of the lottery company with Darren and found that it was empty. Think about it. You've made a dummy machine and you have lottery balls. Why don't we imitate the drawing location which was supposed to be on the tenth floor? Do you mean we should move the lottery drawing location to the ninth floor? But how do we create the same atmosphere? Fatt, you're an actor, right? - Yes. - You sure know a lot of prop teams. - Yes. - That's it. Can you do it as real as possible? - No problem at all. - Good. However, how do we replicate the existing people? It's easy. We just need to guide all staff and guests from the tenth floor to the ninth floor. Everyone needs to take the elevator. We just need to change the elevator control system. When they select the tenth floor, the elevator will head to the ninth floor. I believe the police won't expect that we'll use a dummy machine and replicate the scene to conduct a real lottery draw. This time, we want to deceive the whole world. 6O HOURS BEFORE THE DRAW COUNTING DOWN I have paid the rent for six months. Let's go in now. COUNTING DOWN COUNTING DOWN COUNTING DOWN The 60th Golden Horse Award. The best script writer, Yagood. The best director, Professor. The best actor, Zhou Ren Fatt. I'm at the back staircase now.

Get in the car and chase them. I finally hit the jackpot after decades of buying. However, the 100 million need to be divided among so many people.

Good luck with your business. Don't force me to shoot, Professor. The lottery ticket is with me. Run! - Stupid Choi. - Just go without me. No! I'll be safe. - Go. - Come on. I want to be a tainted witness. Previously, you escaped from prison. This time, it's a fraud. You even held me hostage earlier. Do you think you can negotiate terms with me? For escaping from prison and holding you hostage, the most I'll get is five years in prison. As for fraud, you have no proof, right? I can provide you with all the proof of Big Boss's crime, but you have to promise that you won't disturb my friends. Do you want me to believe that a liar has a lot of evidence? The Theresa murder case in 2016, major nationwide fraud syndicate, Asia's biggest illegal lottery interest, the account used for fund transfer, and the company used to launder money. All evidence is in my hands. You? A person who isn't interested in music but always wears headphones. Don't you think it's weird? I don't like music. …my headphones? Listen. The man who caught you three years ago is in front of you. It wasn't you who caught me three years ago. I gave you the chance to do so. Do you really think the 40 million was thrown into the sea? My three-year prison wage is equal to your lifetime earnings as a police officer. I have ordered my men. If you don't call them before 5 p.m, all the evidence related to Big Boss will be destroyed. Wait for a phone call tomorrow at 5 p.m. If it's a deal, case solved and you'll be promoted. At 5 p.m. What should we do? Should we go our separate ways? In the end, we worked hard in vain. Ren Fatt, what about your daughter? I'll just leave it to fate. - Hello? - It's me. Pass Big Boss's evidence to Ted. Destroy all other evidence that we have. Check if you guys still have any evidence for the operation and burn them. Just accept it. Don't talk nonsense. Let's go over there. Lottery tickets? You should just give me ten dollars. What a stingy man. Where did this lottery ticket come from? Just burn them. - Which draw is this? - The current draw. Check it. You still have hope as long as you buy it. Number 12, 33, 56… - Just burn it. - It didn't win. Number 3, 6… - Burn this as well. - It didn't win as well. Number 17, 20, 25, 28, 37, 43. It's 42. Why didn't you choose 43? During the Golden Horse Award, you lack one vote. For the lottery, you missed one number. Your luck is really… No. You'll still get a prize even though you have five numbers. It's around 1.2 million. It's 1.2 million. We can split it then. No need. Use it all to pay for Fan Fan's surgery. But… Professor would do the same if he were here. My lottery ticket. My lottery ticket. I'm sorry. You got caught because of me. We're actually brothers for life. You don't blame me, right? Number 17, - 20, - 20, - 25, - 25, - 37, - 37, - 42. - 42.
