One percent. There’s one percent left. Dunno. This is bad luck, a bad trip, a system failure. My name’s Kamil Wilk. I’m 19, and I go to High School No. 4 in Warsaw. People! This is our fault! My name’s Agnieszka Wróblewska. I’m 18 years old. People, this is my plea to you: you need to wake up and stop destroying this planet, or else… You need to know it came from the water. THREE DAYS EARLIER This year Antarctica has lost 250 billion tons of ice. Forest fires are raging in Turkey, California, and Greece. Logging continues in the Białowieża Forest… NATIONWIDE PROTESTS …the Baltic is dying. Fishermen keep finding dead fish, pollution causes toxic bacteria… Don’t leave the shadows! Dude, you’re cheating! - Let’s switch to the sniper. - Die! It’s “get wrecked,” pal. Guys, we’re out marching in the climate strike. This is so wild! The police are here to protect us, yay! But guess who’s here with me? It’s Lui! She’s realized Earth is more important than exams. Lui? I’m pimping up the car for you! - You need to come here, guys! - Go back home! Is that how you’re studying? Look at what you’re missing. These are my buddies. My classmates. But I don’t know if I can really call them that because for a long time we’ve only met up online. Young people have rallied worldwide to protest against climate change, demanding government action. Why are you protesting? We’re here because unless we wake up as a species, unless we change, there will be no tomorrow! We don’t want to live in the world adults have left us. This is not our world! Capitalism, always seeking more and more profits! As if we couldn’t see we’re part of the planet! You’re about to get sprayed in the face. With gas. In 2019, the pandemic came upon us. COVID-19. They fucking locked us all down, literally locked everyone in. We spent the best years of high school locked up in these cages in front of computers. - …in 1897. - Excuse me. Paweł! Take notes. This is important. Ma’am, I don’t think I get it. Aga! I wanted to… Aga! - I don’t understand… - Quiet! - We’ll move on to Europe soon. - Yes, but I’d like… When the first wave hit us, my mom died. I ended up in a psycho ward. This is my doctor. I’ll show you my cell. Hi there. Hello. Don’t touch me! - Stop filming, please. - And you stop sighing. Come inside. There’s no telling how long I’ll stay here. With the devils and the lot. Calm down! Who hasn’t been affected by this quarantine? Who? Who? The whole world has pressed pause. So this is what I’m gonna do now. I am gonna… fucking… do it! My dearest amigos, I’m gonna throw you a party, and it will be fucking sick. I promise. Catch her! Police! Come back home! So, party peeps, you are all invited to my big bash. C’mon, y’all! All the party animals are invited to my ark. Not Noah’s Ark. Kamil’s Ark. It’s a pandemic apocalyptic time, we’ll keep the environment in mind. We’ll suck up all sorts of garbage our civilization has heaped upon us. MDM, booze, and acid! Fuck, the white stuff too! Gettin’ so fucking high our shoes will fly off! The heaviest base, the sickest beats! Girls, get yourselves all dolled up. Bros, score some weed, and I’ll see you at my place. The map’s below. I’ll see you all in my palace. Kisses! It’s out. Good morning, Warsaw! It’s 15 May, 6 am, the last day of high-school exit exams. We wish you the best of luck! Yesterday, there were 370 deaths and 2,500 new cases, But the Sun is shining, and it’s a beautiful day. Don’t miss the solar eclipse today. Yes, 15 May will be quite a day! Hi there, man. That’s the spirit. Fuck, yeah! All right, turn it off. Turn it off! Turn it off. - Hola, señorita! - Buenos días! Good morning! Hello, I’m here. Qué pasa? A special menu for a soon-to-be high-school graduate: an omelette or a bacon and egg tortilla. - The tortilla. - Excellent choice. I need some pills to chill. Can you write a prescription? Please. Kamil… Your father and I have decided you should go easy on meds until your exams are over. Because I ended up in your ward one year ago, you can now live in this house, eat our eggs… and whore yourself to my father. Don’t worry, your business is safe. - Eco Wilk is safe. - All right. I’ll meet you in five minutes in my office, okay? I haven’t slept in 21 hours. What’s going on here? Did I miss something? She claims she’s your wife. Yeah? What if we intend to…? I… Spit it out. Is she just a shag or do you love her? I… We… We are together. As for how you treat women, imagine your mother is here, watching you. Think she’d be proud of you? Dunno, but kudos to her for being promoted so quickly. Talk to him. As his former therapist, I shouldn’t… Yes, I know. I don’t know what got into her. I just asked my stepmother, my father’s wife, or just Ms. Psychologist, for pills to help me chill. Tell me something, because I don’t get it. How will you ever become… Yes? I’ll go tank up the chopper. I’m going insane here! Yeah, sure. How will you ever become a serious person if you can’t even get a grip on yourself? All you want is to take! Since we get along so well, I thought I’d move to the palace by the sea after my exams. To throw parties there? No way! We’re in the middle of a pandemic. You need to stay home. I’ll tell you something, honestly. I’m fed up with you. Pass your exams first, kid. You’ve spent two years learning in an online model. Looking at your faces, young, full of hopes and dreams, I’m convinced that a very bright future lies ahead of you. You will live long and beautiful lives. I want you to know that all of us, faculty members… We are all proud of you, and… we wish you good luck in your future endeavors. “Political and cultural achievements of the 16th century.” I studied, so this is not a problem. But what does this have to do with what’s happening in the world? With real problems such as the pandemic? Why don’t you ask us this? Thanks, Aga, that was edifying. You’re wasting your time. The exam just started. Keep writing. Don’t get distracted. Good morning. You look like a little Buddha. And you look like Pocahontas. Like a painting. You waited? - We did. - But why? - You finished quickly. - So did you. I didn’t feel like it. Ready for a trip? Always. You’re sleeping with him? - Are we going? - Yes. - Are you coming? - Yeah. Get off my car! Now! Uh-ho. We’re in trouble. Let’s run away before they lock us here forever. - Luiza, come! - Attention, all students! A new variant… Let’s get the fuck out of here! Lui! Come here! - Move over! - …do not leave the school grounds! I need to go. - I’m sorry. - Luiza! Come on! Attention, all students! A new variant of the virus may be spreading… My brother’s coming with us. There’s a new variant of the virus. You are not to leave the school grounds! - They’re gone. What now? - All right. The back exit. - Hello, guys. - Hi. - Hello! - Hiya! Hiya! Are Mycha and Tola with you? I thought they went with you. We’re leaving town. I’ll call them. You stock up on groceries. Chips, cola, stuff like that. The cash’s in your pocket. Come on! Let’s go! Go, go, go! - We still have some errands to run. - See you! Bye! Check the connections to the Tri-City area. In five minutes, a total solar eclipse will be visible throughout Poland. LIQUOR STORE 24/7 Cool your jets. It’s business. Business is business. Your brother’s not going to kill you. You don’t know my brother. There’s no party without pills. Go get ‘em! Check it out. A full total eclipse. Something big is going down tonight. Fuck, men… When the cops came, I took out my phone to film this. The guy acted all normal. Normal, right? So look at that. The motherfucker started twisting like crazy. As if the devil got inside of him. Look! I got my ass out of there in a fucking flash. The coast guys got scared shitless, blamed the pills, and gave them back. So I’ll leave them here. I got nothing to do with it, but these are my pills, all right? You! Wawa, our club is mighty! Wawa, our club is the best! Wawa, our club deserves respect! Our club, Wawa CKKS! Fuck me! Look who’s here. What do you say? - Hi, bro. - “Hi, bro”? What the actual fuck? There’s a solar eclipse today. Two years. You’ve cut yourself off from the hooligans. Okay. From the club. Okay. But from your bro? - You cut ties with your family. - Fuck off. I took my exit exams. - You took them, or you passed? - I took them. I took mine too, but I didn’t pass. Too many steroids, not enough brains. So what now? That’s sort of why I’m here. We’re throwing a party. You see, we need some pills. You’re a drug dealer now? Are you fucking nuts? - We chipped in. - Everyone in school did? Well, the party will be on the big side. On the big side, my ass. Boys! Get out here! Not a word from you for two years! And the first thing you want is pills? For fuck’s sake! First of all, this is business. We don’t take this stuff. These pills are for lefties and faggots. Look, the sun went black. - What do you say? - Fuck you. Get your ass out of here. I guess it burned through. Fuck, what’s with the wind? Start the car! Let’s go! What’s going on? Hurry up! Paweł! Fuck, start the car! - Come on! - Fuck! Come on! Step on it! They’re following us. - Step on it, Mariusz! - I’m trying! Fuck! - Come on! - Motherfucker! He’s turning back! I can’t see the fucker! Dude, you’ve saved our party! You’ve walked us through a dark valley. I fear no evil, because you are with me. - You said chips were the worst shit. - Jeeze… I know, but I haven’t eaten them since I went vegan. Which was… one year ago. Jasio! The trunk! This is a bad sign. Darn, it’s a shame we missed it. This happens once a millennium. Many cultures saw solar eclipse as a bad omen, the end of the world, divine punishment. It was thought to be caused by mythical animals devouring the Sun. Solar eclipses may have sped up the evolution of our ancestors. The Earth, the Moon, and the Sun align in a uniquely perfect way: precisely so that the Sun can’t poke out from behind the Moon. Jasio, unglue yourself from your phone, and try some “poking” in real life. Jasio, unglue yourself from your phone, and try some “poking” in real life. - Perfect poking. - More like the plagues of Egypt. You got it? Great. So go pack the groceries. Hey, girls. These seats are free. There are free seats over there, too. My friend’s a little shy. Come on, sit. Oh, you want to sit here? No problem, girl. You sit here, I’ll go there, everything’s peachy. These girls, what’s going on in their heads? One is a crazy eco-terrorist. The other acts all devout. Or my sister. She makes me call her “bro.” There are no normal girls left. Yeah. “Girls, gotta smell like a flower, ‘cause no one knows the day or the hour.” Boys, make sure you’re a clean geezer ‘cause you don’t know either. - Awesome freestyle. - Thanks. We need to stop for gas. Aren’t you afraid, girls? What’s there to fear? You only live once, right? I told you, stupid, people are on the move. We have a disco on the coast, and we were wondering if anyone would come. And you, my sour-faced friend, what’s your name? Tola. Tola Ebola. She plays instruments. She writes music. She could’ve won a TV talent show but the virus… I know you from somewhere. I don’t think so. I’m a nurse. Bravo, then! - A nurse! - Thank you. All right, I got it. The train leaves in two hours. And… What? The ticket costs 200 zlotys? No go. - I only have 100. - A hundred will get you nowhere. But in two hours we will make enough. Look. What’s this? This is a business, and I’m freelancing. Showing my ass to losers on the Internet. - Wanna join me? We’ll earn even more. - No, I'm not cut out for it. Yeah, just like that. I like helping people. Changing dressings. Tending to the sick. Drawing blood. I’m not squeamish at all about it. This epidemic has been the toughest time of my life. We were stretched thin, we had no equipment. They recently brought a guy with a new virus mutation. Mom? Stay away from me, girls, all right? We’ve had an awful day at hospital. They brought in a patient… I’ve never seen such a case. His body kept twisting. I feel a little off. I could crash at Tola’s place. Sure. Yes, you do that. - You look pretty. - Thanks. See you! All right, girls, off you go. No one knew what he came down with. We had COVID half a year ago. It was really rough. I lost over 20 pounds. I had a fucking killer headache and fever for three weeks. - I lost 130, so quickly. - But you guys don’t look bad. Gas is so fucking expensive. What? You sold a kidney, huh? Dad’s making so much moolah I thought I’d skim off a little. How’s business? Good? - What did you fuck up this time? - Excuse me? I’m the second in command here after my father, right? Right? Right. What shady deals are you pitching to him? Dumping some fucking pollutants? Disposing of waste? How about we dispose of you, huh? Stand up. Stand up! Stand at attention! Now turn. Start humming. Hum. Louder. Keep humming. Hum. Louder. - You’re trying to tell me… - Your son… Don’t get me started on my son! Are you saying our… Your son! My son is stupid because he’s young, and he is naive like his mother was. But he’s irrelevant. So our waste treatment plants will cause the worst environmental crisis in this country? - Stop it! - I can’t. We signed the contracts. No one in Europe knows what to do with this batch of shit. It was supposed to be so fucking safe. So eco-friendly. The bay always had issues with algal blooms. - They’ll hang up a few warnings. - What are you doing? Just don’t go to the bay for vacation this year. - Why are you whispering? - Your son’s over there. - Where are you going? - For my exam. I want you home by 10 pm. By dinner. Kamil! Kamil! You want something? Hello. Hello there. Hey! I’d like to pay for the gas. Listen up, I’m at the station, I wanna pay for gas, and this dude is high as a kite. Hey, mister! Stefan! Wake up! He’s so high he’s about to fly out of his shoes. Look. Hey, dude! What’s with you, buddy? He’s so high he fell over. We’re at the station, and this guy is stoned solid. Look. OPEN CLOSED Hey, mister! What stuff are you on? I’ll leave the money here. Such a poor man. First this, then that. The biggest paradox is that people are obeseand malnourished. Lui, can you get off the phone? I’ll tell them and come back home. Aga! Cover your mouth, dammit! - Sorry. I’m allergic to everything. - And yet you’re alive? My inhaler ran out. You had one job: to take enough inhalers. Easy. It’s sad that people are now allergic to nature. Do you think she’d make a good surfer? I think she would be awesome! You’ll do a course and we’ll go from beach to beach and rip off rich kids. Do you not see that the world is burning, and the melting ice will flood all the beaches? But the planet will manage. With or without us. You are so ignorant. What’s next? They’ll take us somewhere, arrest us and shoot to death. The heaviest base, the sickest beats! Look. Kamil’s throwing a party. Bros, score some weed… God, what a nutcase. It’s awesome he’s doing it. - So there’s something between you two? - Nah... Why are you holding me? - My guardian angel. - Let me go! You are not allowed here! These are just young girls. Aren’t you ashamed? Let me go! - Hello. - Mamita! This is an illegal gathering! It’s a free country. They have the right to protest! What are you doing? Your exit exams are not over yet. Luiza? Do your parents know where you are? My mom thinks LGBT is a disease like COVID, and the climate strike is a conspiracy. This is so wild! Give me a kiss. Max, watch the road! - Not until she gives me a kiss. - Max! Watch the road. Watch the road! Please be careful. Stop! It’s alive. We need to help it. No! Max! - It was dead. - No, it wasn't! Should I let a Wuhan bat peck me to death? It’s a seagull. Rabid I guess. All animals form one big nervous system by which they communicate. The ocean causes reactions… It is defending itself. What? Jasio, go back to the car. You’re sick! Jasio, please. The ocean sent a seagull to warn us away. We need to put the pandemic behind us. So we are now… We’re going to a party in Łaznów. - To the palace. - Quiet! Łaznów is quite a way from where the train stops. We’ll be driving past that palace, so we can drop you off there. What say you? - Really? - Yeah. Cool. Oh, fuck. - Virus inspection. - Good evening. Where will you be staying? Wacek, it’s me, Kamil Wilk. We are on our way to the palace. Oh, Kamil. Good evening. Do you have valid tests? Are you vaccinated? No, we don’t have any documents on us. All right, let’s get you tested. The season’s on, and the virus keeps mutating. I need to test everyone. - Who is that fucking nutcase? - Cool it. Show some respect. - He’s a local Kashub. - Whoa, then my apologies. He has a camp site here. And a cool daughter. Kamil… I was sorry to hear your mother passed. Me too. I’m sorry we didn’t call. It’s the pandemic. That’s why we must be careful. - What do you mean by “cool”? - You’ll see. - Good evening. - Good evening. - I’m not saying you have COVID. - No. But whoever tests positive can forget about the beach, cold drinks, and sunshine. - What’s up? - Hi, Kamil. Max killed a bird. Killed it, just like that. Wacek, these are my friends. Very positive people. Gentlemen, you all tested negative. You are free to go. As for your friends, we’ll see. Voilà. Le palais. Oh, man! Listen, this palace was built in the 17th century. It belonged to Polish aristocrats during the Napoleonic Wars. French troops were stationed here. …it was plundered by the Soviets and turned into a state farm. Piggies! So beautiful! Hello! Yes, you’re beautiful too! Here are the pigs. Save it, Max. You’re gonna kill them too? Cut me some slack. Pigs can surf. Who’s a sweet little piggy? What are their names? These are Polonica Porcus. We call them palace pigs. - Palace pigs! - Let’s come inside. Save it, all right? But I love pigs! My dad met my mom on the coast. That’s why he bought the palace. They renovated it together. This place is marvelous. An awesome crib. Totally sick. Is your old man a cocaine king? - Or a priest? - Guess again. Kudos to you for getting out of the house. Attagirl! So the night is ours. - We’ll grab a nice room, you know… - Stop it! Out, girls. Gimme two colorful drinks. Józek’s dead. Those Warsaw fuckers are selling bad stuff. Józek… A poor boy. We didn’t take that shit. We can’t let this slide. Fuck. How are we supposed to survive this season? No parties? And no pills? We can’t live like that. - Is there a power outlet here? - You’d better get the fuck out of here. - Will you charge mine too? - Stop it or they’ll hire us here. I could pole dance for a living. Bring me those Warsaw scumbags. We’ll rough them up. Things might not be that bad. We were traveling by train, and we met those two girlies. - Let’s get out of here. - Chill, they’ll drive us to the party. Some big-ass party with plenty of kids from Warsaw. We could get our asses there, see what’s going on. We could get chummy and get us new clients. My mom was an art lover, and my dad likes weapons. The history of Polish weaponry in one room. A quintessence of violence, yay! Don’t touch or move anything. This can only get you killed. - What? - So awful. - Awesome! - Awful. It’s so beautiful in here! I admit I’m no longer surprised you are such a smooth talker. Do tell. That’s the color of the throat chakra. It’s a central energy point responsible for self-expression. Your mom was savvy. - That’s a Malczewski. - Wyspiański. Gentlemen, to the pantry! - Are these for you? - For the babes. They’ll give us spiked drinks and sell us. - Stop it… - Hey, girls. Want some drinks? - How are you doing? - Thank you. - Take it. - It feels stuffy in here. Darn, the night is hot. How about we go for a swim? Well, that’s a thought. Let’s go for a swim, sober up a little. Let’s go skinny dipping. I’m cool. Off we go, then. - Let’s go! - Come on. Come on, let’s go. Come here. - Follow me. - No slacking. This is our private beach. ALGAL BLOOM - The last one in gets the clap. - So hurry up. So, my coxswains. - Who? - Coxswains. Whatever happens, the captain is the last to jump ship. Darn. You have a problem, you come to me. We solve it together. Right? - Right? - Yes sir! Lui? Let’s take this off. She should not see what will be happening here. I know this. Or else I’ll have you skewered. Strong words. I want you to have fun, stay positive. I want you to catch a buzz. Fuck, I want you to party! Follow me! What’s going on? Aga! - Jesus! - Thieves! - What is happening? Aga! - Hurry up! Stop! Stop! These are Mirek and Mirka, the guardians of the palace and local Kashubs. Little Kamil! We’re throwing a party unlike this world has ever seen. - Birthday, yes? - Don’t tell dad, it’s a surprise. All right, you little whores, enough with this sweet-talking. Your parents know what you’re up to online? What? I don’t understand. Look, Misiek is a guy who knows all the websites in this country with horny teen girls like you. And we’re here to recruit you to work in our club. We are a godsend for you. Get undressed, girls. The time has come. Come on! Easy, you’re not gonna rape us, right? - We sure as fuck can! - This should be fun. If we strip, so do you. I can take off everything. Look! Come on. Chop, chop! My belt is already gone. Whoever strips first gets something extra from me. I’m almost naked, and I’m waiting. Come on! Chop, chop! Come on! - Come here. - It’s awesome in here. They’re so dumb. Bathe too much, ma said, and you’ll end up dead! Fuck, I’m itchy like crazy! What’s going on? - Help! - Do something. Jesus… - I’m not really a nurse. - Call an ambulance! Get his phone! Hurry! Call an ambulance! - You got it? - No. - Hurry up! - I’m trying! Your passcode! We don’t have our phones! Fuck, give me the passcode! Tola and Mycha are not answering. I think they muted their phones. They should be here. Hurry up! Keep running. - Lui… - Yeah? Go grab me a brewski. Coming right up. Run! Lui, what’s with you? They can’t treat you like this. They’d like to make us their slaves. Tell him something. I had a rough day. I need to chill, all right? Get off your ass. What the fuck is going on? What the fuck…? Anyone else? Anyone else? Fuck! Are you okay? Oh, fuck. Fucking awesome. Let’s get out of here. “It all happened back in Kościuszko’s day My lord supported the law of 3 May With the Confederates we wished to fight But the Muscovites attacked us by night We fire’d off the mortar, yet had slight time To bar the door, or for battle to prime The Pantler, me, the lady o’the castle Three cooks, too drunk to get into a hassle, A priest, a lackey, four hajduks, all brave We took up our guns, we were not afraid The Muscovites barged in, ‘Hurrah’ they choired We shouted ‘Get out!’, and ten guns we fired.” What sort of party? Hardcore disco? Hip-hoppers? Nah, just a party. What is that? A yurt. I made it all by myself. Watch your step. This place is filled with traps. Don’t be afraid. There’s no place safer than Mr. Blitz’s place. There. Wait. Weird, I’ve never had guests here. Come inside. Close the door. Gosh… My parents were hippies. They made me in a yurt like this. She’s never eaten meat. Neither have her parents. I once stuffed myself with algae. They penetrated my organic structure. So I became an algae-man. I produce oxygen and electricity. Electricity! You have alien eyeballs. - What? - They were implanted by aliens. They can watch what you see. Your alien eyeballs are sending out signals to good aliens, or bad ones. - That’s so cool! - I’m not sure. Very cool. But why does your voice sound so weird? You see this? It was a woman. I cried, like this. She did a number on me. So I couldn’t tell her how I felt, I took red-hot scissors and tried to cut out my vocal cords. Voilà. So you sit here and play? I used to play. In all sorts of bands. Until people became greedy. So I came here to protect the woods. - Will you play with me? - What? Come on. Electricity! Make electricity! Sing! MUNICIPAL POLICE Morning, Wacek, how are you? Master Kamil arrived last night. It’s a good sign, others will come. Sure thing they will. She’ll be leaving the nest soon, Wacek. What? Doggy is tired, huh? It’s so beautiful in here! Good morning! - Good morning. - So no canoodling, huh? They locked the door. - Breakfast? - These are not for you. Your breakfast’s downstairs. Now hush. Hey… Rascal? Are you okay? Oh, fuck. - Good morning. - Morning. Dad! It’s Rascal! - Hurry! - Hang on. He’s alive? I think he went somewhere. - This means he’s alive. - Jeeze, I’m not insane. I touched him, he was hot, but he wasn’t breathing or moving. Luckily, he’s all right. Rascal! Rascal! Rascal was a gift from mom. I know. - If he dies, she’s totally gone… - I know. I understand. Your mother was the only person who knew what to do with this land. She told me, “You’ll see, Wacek, communism will fall. There’ll be capitalism, we’ll profit from this land.” I was young. Money just fell into my lap. I started drinking. Rascal! Everyone drank back then. Everyone. I drank everything away. Your childhood and my marriage. Why are you telling me all this? - One day, this will be yours. - No, it won’t. I’ll sell it all. - No, you won’t. - But I will. No. Please. Kamil. Go, you’ll have fun. Go. Rascal will make his own way back. Jesus. - This will be wild! - Sea christening! - Jagna, help me with the champagne. - Sure. All right, guys, come here. I’m so happy you’re with me. Everyone come here! Or we don’t go surfing. Sweet! Surf’s up! We can hang ten. There’s a huge algal bloom right off the coast. That’s a bad idea. Cyanobacteria? So we can’t swim. They are highly toxic to humans and caused by pollution. All right, Jagna and I will go and check these blooms. Okay? Thanks. To Neptune! This place is paradise! I envy you so much. What paradise? I want to go England to study. I see. My horizons broadened, my eyes opened, and… Your eyes opened? - What did they open to? - You only care about cars. You have your passion. But what about me? I don’t want to raise your kids and wait for you to come home. How do you know all that? I wonder what it would be like if we switched lives. You have everything, you had a mom. You didn’t even call me when mom died. So it’s my fault? That things are what they are? I wasn’t up to it. I was on psychotropic drugs. I know nothing, Jagna. Nothing! What’s that? It’s the algae. Wait. It got stuck in the throttle. I’ll try to unclog it. I’ve been thinking, and I decided that we’re just… not compatible. I’m breaking up with you. - No, I’m breaking up with you. - No, I made this decision a month ago. Oh, did you? All right, whatever. - So we’re free, right? - Yes. At the party, we can do whatever we want? And with whomever we want. Stop! - Could you take a picture of us? - Hi, sure. There’ll be a party in the palace. You know it? - Yes. - So you can come at seven. - Sure! - And bring this energy with you! Fuck me. - You promise? - Thanks! - See you! - You’ll come? Are you sure? Yes? Awesome. See you. It will be wild. Try now. Kamil! Come on. Hurry up! Come on! Calm down. But you can’t stand like that. One foot to the front, yes, and the other here. Time for a christening. Max, no! Max! Max, stop! No! - Let me go! - Don’t throw here there! Max! What are you doing? God… Kamil! Kamil! Aga! - Hey! - Aga! Wait! - You got something? - A strong antihistamine. Mario, the sleeve. And the other one. - It’s all right. - Calm down. Calm down! Jagna, just come to the party, okay? Jeeze… Just look at him! Good evening, where are you going? To Kamil’s party! - How many people? - Many! Looks to be a hell of a party. I don’t have enough tests. Move along. Get inside! You rest, and we’ll take care of everything. We’re leaving. I said we’re leaving! - But…? - We’re leaving! I’m so happy you’re okay. Your skin is so soft. It would be a shame if it were covered with blisters. - Thanks for punching him in the face. - So I do have a shot with you? Guests! Excuse me, I can’t leave the house without a host. I’m too tired. Can I get you a drink, sweetheart? I myself don’t like being called sweetheart, though. I don’t drink. To your health! You just lie here and rest. - I’ll take you to a wedding one day. - Whose wedding? Ours. - Just go. - It will be one hell of a wedding! Hey kiddo… what you gave us saved our lives. You cured us. I hereby name you my court physician. Arigato, Kamil-san. Hi! - Hiya, man! - Hi. Hiya! Help yourselves. Hi! You know why I did it? You didn’t listen. You’re a god. But one you can punch in the face. She’s amazing and smart. Don’t treat her like some random girl. Be good to her. Oh, hi. Max. I apologize. I don’t know what came over me. I didn’t know you’d turn into Shrek in water. My dad always did that to me. I’m from a family of gym teachers. It’s okay, really. I’ll check if your rash has cleared up. - Max… - I need to see. It’s gone. The neck looks all right too. I’m so into you. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt this way before. You are… A toxic fertilizer. Every night, those motherfuckers pour this into the sea every night! Let’s dance! While there’s still time. All right, pour me another one. Kamil, it’s too much for me. I’m out of here. Wait, Jagna. Wait! Jagna. Let’s end this. We played by our parents’ rules, but now I’m the boss here. All right, so tell me why my mom never invited me here. She wanted to protect you from this mess. - What mess? - From this filth. Hey! Give me shots. Awesome! Jagna… I want you to move in here, to come to live here and be the manager… Fuck me, you sound like my father. Okay, pour me one. I’ll make you a drink. From Kamil. You know Alf was inspired by a Springer Spaniel? Because it ate cats. And there it is. Hey, guys, listen up. We were on a train, and we met two guys. They were so stoned that they started hitting on us. Without Mr. Blitz they’d have killed us and buried us in the woods. - Who? - Mr. Blitz. What can I get you? Water. There are poisonings. There will be deaths. The apocalypse is coming. - What? - The apocalypse! People! The apocaparty is upon us! This gentleman here says so! Girls, I’ll help you get gussied up. And you pour him one, he’s got thirsty. Here you are. Water. Clean and healthy. Thank you. Follow me. This is mom’s wardrobe. From now on, everything here is yours. The dresses, the shoes, the bling. You must be tired from the long trip. The bathroom is over there. Feel free to take a hot bath. I can help you scrub your backs… For example. Hey! I’ll show you something. Come. Come on. - What will you show me? - You’ll see. - Now get out. - But… - Now. - I can get you tea… - Great, you do that. - …clove tea or hot drinks. I’m begging you, please… Does Kamil have a sister? - Kamil? - You know anything? That Kamil is totally cute. Oh, I could see myself here. As who? Mrs. Wilk? Who else? If he noticed me. But he only has eyes for Aga. She doesn’t give a crap about him. And I’ll likely end up with some loser. You know… If this palace burns down tonight, and from the looks of things it will, his father will disinherit him, and he’ll end up homeless. Come on, we’re at a party, right? Where do you… Where do you get… all these negative thoughts from? From my skull. I’d like to say I’m grateful to you for coming forward and rescuing our friends, and for visiting my ark. Here’s electricity. Electricity. Awesome. Electricity. Fire. And flora. From my garden. These three pillars combined will give us Captain Fumo. Fumo. Smoke. Feel me and you’ll never feel pain again. The pain of existence. That’s right! Impregnation! A protective barrier! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hurrah! Have you seen Kamil? We’ll never get out of here. A Nissan S14. - The engine? - From a Supra. - The three-liter 2JZ, 600 horses. - Actually, 640. Is it yours? Mine, yours. It could be yours. All right, all right. First you show me what you can do. Hop in. - Are you okay? - Awesome! This is the loveliest night of my life. That’s not what I’m asking. Focus. Are you physically well? Look. What are you doing? - I thought you wanted to kiss. - No. Look at my saliva. Aga… I want to tell you something. This whole thing, this party is for you. Jesus, my child, it’s an animal. This is its fate. Take that pig away! Don’t you see it’s traumatizing people? [singing in Kashubian minority language] Mirek! Mirka! Are you telling me you’ve killed one of our palace pigs? I petted that pig. I can’t stand this anymore. All right, look, just go open the gate for new guests, okay? - Now scoot. - What a brat… Pork for everyone! Excuse me. All right. I’ve always wanted to meet someone like you, a girl who loves cars. We could make quite a team. You’re the best girl I know, I fear you will tell me no. I finally feel love every day, but I must pretend it’s all just play. I want to make love to you day and night… Do you know why I adore you? Because you are a walking billboard for reusable bags, solar panels, and veganism. Because you’d shag the last porpoise to save it from extinction, and if your house was burning, you’d rescue your hamster first, and then your family and everyone else. …it is all just play. Every day I think about you, trying to stop only makes me blue. I dream of us setting up a commune together. We should live like a tribe, and it has to start here, in this palace. Girl, I love you so much. Us against the world… An event posted online and you don’t invite me? You thought I wouldn’t find out? Motherfucker. Fuck! Stop! It’s a green revolution! A green revolution! - Where are the pills? - They should be… Shut up! - Come here. - I’m telling you… Where are they? - Fuck! - The pills! Come here! I’m asking you. - Where are the pills? - My pills, for fuck’s sake! Hey, easy, calm down. We’re here to have fun, right? If you want to spank someone, spank me. Shake your ass for me! Shake it! Shake it! Fuck! Where are our pills? Tell me! Pills are falling from the sky. There. What the fuck? - Fuck! - Fuck, no! Where? How? Pick them up! Now! Pick up the pills! Do it! Now! Cheers. No! Oh, fuck… The only thing I want is to leave this place. Run away. Be constantly on the move. You get me? But with my luck… we won’t get very far tonight. So let’s move… staying right here! No! All right, your turn. Why did you do that? No risk, no champagne. What the fuck is wrong with you? Am I some sort of a doll you can just throw into water? - I thought you’d like it. - For fuck’s sake! - I’m sorry. - Fuck you! - I’m sorry. - Fuck you! Fuck! When you turn, shift down, put the pedal on the medal. At that moment, you die for a moment to become reborn in a new world, and I promise it will be a good one. I’ve never done anything like this before. Queen Aga thinks she’s so fucking awesome. They chase her like dogs, and she keeps them on a leash. I’m no worse than her. I’m not worse! Sugar? Palm oil? One bar like this practically equals one dead orangutan. So I’m not sexy? Huh? You don’t like me? I’m burning! Wanna touch me? God wants us to be here, you know. He has led us here. - He wants us here. - The god of pills? No blaspheming! You have a baby face, but this head of yours is smart. You want to kiss me? I have bad news for you. I have paranoid schizophrenia. I would destroy you. You would cry and cry. All right. Tell me what you see in me. Come on, scan me with your phone. - You are very beautiful, you know? - Duh! Luckily, some decisions get made at the biology level. - And nothing can be done. - What decisions? Everything just happens. And my bacteria are now your bacteria. Yeah! All right, you brats! For the last time, who is the host here? Welcome! It’s me! I am the host in this estate! Kamil Wilk the Second. Look, sucker, nothing happens on the coast without my permission. Nothing happens in this house without my permission. What the fuck are you doing? Having all these people in here, instead of in my clubs. So what? I don’t get it. What is it you don’t get? I’m losing money. Look, you greasy-haired brat, we have a problem. I’m looking for two floozies. A blonde and a brunette. They ruined my men. Look what they did to them. They’re sick, they have some virus. Ptasiek! Well, well, well. Things could’ve been so good. No. We could never be together. The feeling between us was just so big. But we were divided by love… of sports clubs. Wawa, our club is mighty! Wawa, our club is the best! Wawa, our club deserves respect! Our club, Wawa CKKS! I didn’t want to be with you, - so you killed my man? - Wawa CKKS! Go get them! Stop! When two tribes fight it out, it’s got to be with honor. Yes or no? With honor. - With honor? - With honor. Paweł? Paweł, for fuck’s sake! They are going to kill me. When two teams go to the test, ladies and gentlemen make bets. One side wins, the other loses. Whites versus reds. It’s fate that chooses. C’mere. C’mere. - Not now, Max. - C’mere. Paweł, come on. Come on! Max! Leave me alone! Max! Beat him up! Leave me alone! What are you doing? A pretty smartass! Fuck! We’re fucked. Max? Fuck! Fuck! Kamil! Get inside! Run! What is going on? Let me go, bro! Wake up! Hide behind me! I do not allow that! Aga? What happened? I killed him. Leave her alone! Let’s get the fuck out of here! Here, call my dad. Calm down, bro! Fuck! Calm down! Tola, come on! Get up! Tola! Tola! It’s those pills. Dammit! What did I do? But what if… it’s the cyanobacteria? A combo of the germs and pills. Look, my old man is dumping toxic waste into the sea. What if this waste acts as a nutrient for the algae? Jagna! -Jagna! Jagna?-What’s up? I’m calling from the palace. You need to come here. -I can’t talk now.-Hello? Look at the green stuff in his mouth. It looks like cyanobacteria. They get poisoned, go into an allergic shock, and die. The germs then attack the spinal cord. - Zombies! - Let’s get out of here. Rascal! Come here! Come here! Quick! Come here! Wait! I’ve got one shot left. He’s my brother. I have to go back and give it to him. Janek… He’s gone. We need to leave now. Come with us. You’ll help us, doc. Imagine this is all a game. Get it? An RPG. Jagna! This is level one. We need to get to the gate. That’s our goal. Luiza! Luiza! The painting. Help me. Three. Two. One. Jagna! Jesus! Luiza! Fuck. Tola? We must end the suffering of this… disgusting usurper of Tolashness. We must pierce the pineal gland of what used to be Tola. You get it? I can’t! Fuck! I can’t! No! Fuck! Step away! What are you doing? This is Tola! She’s emo. She’s always looked like that. Fuck! Leave her. Let’s go! - Leave her! Fuck, hurry! - Tola! No! Tola, come on… Go ahead. Jagna? Jagna! Jagna! It’s me! What did they do to you? We need to get out of here! Jagna! Hurry the fuck up! Hurry! Lock the door! To the armory! Hurry! The door! Hurry, for fuck’s sake. Close the door! What did you give my little Jagna? What drugs? Fuck, what’s going on here? These are not drugs. It’s a plague. - What plague? - Zombies. Oh, zombies? Fuck. What did you take? It’s like a movie, but it’s for real. This is not fiction. Ever seen an animal with rabies? It’s a virus. It takes over the nervous system. The only way to kill them… Is to blow up their brains. A virus… If this is a virus, she’s sick. If she’s sick, we must take her to hospital. I’d like to apologize. What for? For not protecting Jagna. And for the fact that mom left you. Kiddo… Help me. We have to catch her and save others. Do you hear me? Let’s go get them. We find Jagna. We catch her, and we get to the gate. Don’t kill anyone unless you have to. Is that clear? No matter what happens, no one, fucking no one… No one touches Jagna. I’ll get her. Arm yourselves. Let’s do it! For Jagna! Jagna! No! Stop, child! Jagna! No! Dad! I’m sorry, it’s all my fault. What happened here? - You’re dying. - My son… I will never die. Kamil, we must go. Come on! - Where are Mycha and Paweł? - I don’t know. Come on! Follow me! Kamil! Take this. One percent. There’s one percent left. Let’s record it. Dunno. This is bad luck, a bad trip, a system failure. My name is Kamil Wilk, I go to High School No. 4 in Warsaw. This is our fault! Give me that. My name’s Agnieszka Wróblewska. I’m 18 years old. People, this is my plea to you: you need to wake up, and stop destroying this planet, or else… You need to know it came from the water. It’s dead. It’s dead. We’re gonna die here. Yeah. And if we’re gonna die… I’d like to confess something. Well, I… I’ve never… You know. Yeah, I know. Neither have I. And if we are to die… I wouldn’t like to… Hang on. Peekaboo! I got you! I really don’t know what happened to her. Come! Are you okay? Wait. You should know I showed my ass on the Internet. What does it matter now? Tola? Tola? Easy. She’s vegan. - Vegan? - Yeah, a vegan zombie! Good Tola. Be good, Tola! Watch out! Janek! Luiza! Help! Let me go! - Janek! - Luiza! Let me go! Paweł! - Mycha! - Hey! Fuck, bro! You’re alive! Fuck… Fuck, this is good. Promise me we’ll never be apart again. Lui! Lui! - Janek… - Where’s Janek? - Where’s Janek? - Janek… is dead. I wasn’t fast enough. - Fuck! - I wasn’t fast enough. I wasn’t fast enough. Hey! Hey! Jesus! - Fuck, I’m alive! - What’s this? This shot saved me. I stabbed him and then jabbed myself. Totally… Good boy! What the fuck? The medic! Hurry! Come here. Subtitle translation: Cutting Edge Media (A. Król, D. Sax)
