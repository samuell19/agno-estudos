[Kirstin speaking indistinctly] [Kevin] Music is a lot of fun. You can rock. You can do rock, jazz... Even... even classical. It's a good thing for you to do music. Everybody says it's good. I'm kinda like... I kinda like it. [Laughing] Mitch! Hey, I'm Scott. I love to perform and sing. [Esther] I wanna show Avi something. [Woman] Avi and Esther turn around and wave! Hi. [Woman] Avi! - Hi! - Hi! Now that we've already begun the Kaplan kids great adventure, where are we now? [Scott] They were, like, "We're gonna put the Grammy here." I was, like, "Oh!" No, no, it's not because I want it. It's because I'm afraid you'll lose it. - Yeah, okay. - [Both chuckling] [Kirstin] Now, I'll sing "Love Story." ♪ Where do I begin ♪ ♪ To tell a story about How great love can be ♪ ♪ Where do I start ♪ [Kevin] I don't remember "Uptown."

And, now I feel like I'm starting to learn to place things to where I can project. - All right. - [Kirstin] Yeah. [Singing in Latin] I did like parts of it. It feels really low. Did we do it too low? Feel like we're low. I think it was low. - Felt a little low. - I think it's too low. So, wait. So, it's... So, it's C-minor. What... Wasn't... What were you guys just in, B? - I have no idea. - Oh, then try C. C? [Hums note] Three, four. [All harmonizing in Latin] Shut the... That's it. Just so you guys know, when they are ready for you, I think they're just going to do a walk-through of the design elements but they're not ready for all of you. I think that's what's happening-- Just getting a little presentation ready. So, I think it's just gonna... They're all just gonna show off. I'm excited! - Yeah, it's really cool. - That's exciting! We're just showing you what it looks like in a general basic format right now. I think it's all right. - Cool! - Fingers crossed, man. So how's it feel to be Grammy award winners, huh? Really exciting! [Travis] I can imagine, guys. Super weird. That's pretty awesome, huh. I'm already excited! It's exciting. I think the fans are gonna react like we reacted when we first saw. [Avi] First of all, we're walking into an arena. I don't think we've ever played an arena this big. I mean, it's just... It's just really cool and amazing to even just be here. I didn't really know what else to expect. I just knew it was going to be amazing. Travis was showing us everything. And it just... - You guys ready? - All right, uh... Doug, let's go on lift number one, please. - Holy molly! - [All exclaiming] [Scott] Oh, my God. That's a nice set. And then all the lights came on. And we just freaked out. It was just epic. It looks like a real show. It's moving. Oh, my God. This is sick. Ah! Wow, this is very awesome. [Travis] Let's walk you guys on stage and show you what we have there, just to get you comfortable with all that. Our parents are gonna die. They're gonna be like, "Whoa"! It's just really crazy to know that this is our set. Like, we worked for this, and it makes sense for us. And that's the craziest part about it, is that, is that this actually makes sense for us now. [Kirstin] Can I step on them? I already went for it. It exceeded our expectations ten fold. I think it inspired us all, too. We're gonna be performing way more full out. We're gonna feel more legit. The fans are gonna feel like they're at a concert. Rather than like a recital. Exactly, yeah. It may be a capella, but when they come to the show and see everything they're gonna be like, "This is a rock concert." I really think the choreography-- Hi! Chore-- Speaking of choreography... Here we go. Here we go. Good to see you. How are you? Good to see you. You guys, remember at the AMAs, we performed on a small little janky stage in the corner, - like, with cables everywhere. - [Kevin] Yeah. And now you guys are here. Like, it's... But you know what? Like, moments like that is what makes you appreciate coming out on stage right now and being, like, look what you've just been given. So, I'm excited. I'm so ready. [Dejan] So, since intro, we don't see them until the solo-- Can we hear... Do you have the audio of that intro again? [Scott] We can just sing it if you want. You'll be able to hear it that way. We're not prepared, but... Oh, my God. I love you guys right now. One, two, three, four...

Let's take this to the limits. [Kirstin] I was very excited to start because I knew we were going to up production. Like, we have an entire new crew. Not all of it has come together yet, but that's kind of even more exciting because it's... When it all finally comes together it's gonna be amazing. [Travis] Pretty big show, you know. This is four trucks of gear. Um, you know, 115 moving lights, a crew of 30 people. This is no small show. [Scott] There's just so much more to be done. We are just a very detail-oriented group. And there's like a lot to be done-- A lot of details to lock in before, oh, God, I don't know-- - Our show on Wednesday. - Yeah. - Want some Goldfish? - [Scoffs] How embarrassing for him. Goldfish are the best. So, this how it's gonna go down all the time? Just a bunch of cameras around? I don't mind it. I will definitely be eating 100 percent of the time. No! You can't... You can't in front of the camera. No. Of course I was gonna not say, probably, what I was gonna say. No, but you have to say what you were gonna say normally. Okay, I don't know what I would say. Probably something rude. Really rude. It would have been funny! Like, why are you asking me? I'm busy. This means you had a good run through with rehearsal. That's good. Oh, good. Stop! This is my sister. That's true. I would say it's gone pretty not super-smooth. Not super-smooth. We're stressed out because we have so much to do, but always comes together as they say. [Esther] We're gonna fly on Tuesday. One o' clock on Tuesday. And we're landing at 3:30 and then we're rehearsing starting at 5:00 on Tuesday. And then our show is the next day. So, we're just gonna hope, at five, that all of it is basically perfect? Fingers crossed. I'm paranoid about it. - Okay, and what's today? Friday? - [Esther] Yes. Oh, my God, are we going out? I'm proud of you. Yeah, you guys did this. I'm so very, very proud of you. - Love you. Thank you. - Yeah, I love you too. And I'm really looking forward to seeing you guys in Oakland. The plan. Not slipping again. [Avi] I know, it's so intrusive. [Esther] At least I'm eating a salad. [Avi] I think that this tour is the first tour where we finally felt, we were, like, playing in the big leagues. Like, we started at the bottom. You know what I mean? And we just slowly worked our way up. This is the culmination... ...of everything we've worked for. And everything the fans have worked for. And it was like, we've finally arrived, you know. Like, this is it. This is what it's meant to be. We can show you what we've been envisioning, like, our entire lives. Now, think about your wildest dream. Like, if I can do anything this would be it. That's what's happening to us. [Whistling] - Don't do that. - Okay. I think I was very anxious rather than nervous. Just really anxious to get on the road and really... To see how all of these moving parts would come together into this cohesive show. And I think, you know, we're so happy with it. And we're so happy that our fans are coming out. It's cool to know that the hard work is paying off. [Scott] I feel ten times better today. [Mitch] I feel better, too. I was worrying about it all weekend, but now that we ran it through... I feel good about it. We've run it a lot, the video content is coming together. - How do you feel about it, Kirstin? - What? I feel grand... about the show. I just practiced in my heels for the first time. She's practicing in her heels. That's what Beyonce does. And I didn't die. So that's always promising. Night before the tour. This is grind time we call it, you know. We have quite a bit of work to do. There won't be much sleeping tonight. [Indistinct conversations] [Esther] I hate... It's Bobby McFerrin. Bobby McFerrin. - Bobby McFerrin. - Bobby McFerrin. [Esther] I've been trying, nobody ever laughs when I do it. You never do it. [Mitch] Yeah, that's because you don't deliver it right. Yeah, you have to commit to the joke. What are you doing? All my vertebrae just popped. Wait. I wanna try! - Let me try it. - Okay. It's my turn! How flat was my television solo? [Mitch] Very! Very... No, was it actually very flat, though? I don't remember actually. Well, I didn't notice, so it must have not been terrible. Pick up your phone. All right, good talk. What do I do? You lay it back and then you, like, roll it on your back. You're so stupid. Are you kidding me? Okay. Now push yourself. Roll it back. No, this isn't working. It doesn't feel good. You just don't know how to do it. Ow! Oh! Okay, this does nothing for me. [Mitch] Your first day. I'm proud of you. [Kevin] Man, so we have a day before the show. I feel pretty good. There's just certain things that need to be synchronized and solidified, but, you know... It's the last day. We're gonna make it work. We always do. We have an amazing team. It's gonna be a good time. It's gonna be a great show, y'all. Tomorrow's gonna be crazy. Whoo! [Mitch] Yeah, my voice is really tired after the run through. But, I think, going through the show would be a good idea. I feel like it's also not done, maybe. [Kirstin] It's, like, borderline, getting sick. I always get sick. I don't even do crazy things to make me sick. I just... I'm just delicate. [Kirstin laughing] [Kevin] I just started taking voice lessons. So, it's kind of nerve-racking singing on stage. Um, I'm not sure how it's gonna go, but I hope it goes really well. 'Cause, once again, this is not something I've really done before. I can't believe it's finally here. This is so exciting, you know. To finally put all this together that we've been working on for... I mean, maybe a couple of weeks, to be completely honest. So it's a little nerve-racking. But I think it's gonna be an amazing show. You ready? I said, you ready? - What's up? - Aw. How you doing? You take that for me? Yes. You playing. Go get your own stuff. Yo. Yo. Come on, bro. Hey, you just can't do that. All right. Me too. I'm real excited. Not like your jacket. I'm also a little bit nervous. I'm not nervous. That's a good attitude. That's a good attitude. I ain't nervous. I ain't never scared! First day of tour! Low on energy. I need to eat about five gallons of food. ♪ All of my kindness ♪ [Kevin] Sing it, baby. ♪ Is taken for weakness ♪ This is good. Sing it, bro. [Avi] Can I delete PTX Volume One off of our Twitter and put Grammy Award winning-- Yes. Well, here we go. I seriously was like, "How are we going to do this? How are we gonna put together this show? Not just us, but the entire crew, the video, the staging, like, everything about it, in, honestly, like, a week?" And I'm not even being dramatic, like, I just didn't know how we were going to do it. [Mitch] It had been a while since we had actually done a full tour. So, I was eager to get back in, but we had such a limited amount of time. I mean, there are a lot of details that go into it. So, we were a little stressed about that. [Travis] After your sound check, just give me ten minutes with you guys and we'll figure that out. I like your... Your cardigan thing is sick. Let's do it. You're talking business and I'm talking cardigans. [Avi] At the end of the day, no matter what happens with this group, like, we always get it done. I don't know how we do it. We always get it done, I genuinely don't know. [Esther] I mean, you just... You don't want it, like, slick or shiny, but just, kind of, create a hold? [Travis] Yeah, yeah, just to create a hold. [Esther] Yeah, and... We can do that, like, I would say, you know... I literally have never been hungrier. I know. It's like you just got off the island. That's how I feel. Yeah, I feel like I'm on the show Survivor. Avi versus carrot. Like, real gross. Literally, leave this out of the documentary. [Kirstin laughing] And there is catering with, like, fish and steak. Hmm? Yeah. I think so. They have steak out there now? What the freak am I eating vegetables for? Time for VIP, y'all. Let's go. [Mitch] Don't talk to me that way. So, we're heading to the VIP meet and greet right now. Our first one on tour. Our first one ever on tour. I'm really excited. The fans seem really nice, they were at sound check and they were so sweet. They gave us cupcakes. Like six of them had Scomiche shirts on. Nobody is coming with us. Whatever. - I want it to be in there. - We'll entertain the masses. Oh, my God! He was eating a chocolate banana. I want a chocolate banana. Me too. Fast feet, fast feet, Fast feet, fast feet! What I love about our fans is that it's three generations of people. I love when we meet people and they're like, "Thank you so much. I can finally go to a concert and enjoy this music with my daughter." And it's like a family event.

Dude, should I wear another white shirt or do you like it creeping out? What else would you wear? Just nothing? A black one or nothing.

The crowd's really loud and excited. - Do you like it? - Yeah, you look great. - Cool. Sister approval, that's all I need. - [Esther chuckles] I'm nervous. Oh, my God. It's becoming real. I'm, like, nervous if I'll forget the words and I'm just standing by. I know. Words are scary. Oh, well. If I forget the words, I'll be like, "Well, I changed them on the spot." I wrote 'em, so whatever. I feel like I'm gonna trip. That's what I'm scared about. Oh, my God, yeah. You're gonna be walking through a crowd. [Kevin] It's hard to look this good, dude.

How do you guys feel? [Indistinct conversations] [crowd] PTX! PTX! PTX! [Kevin] Father God, thank you so much for this absolutely amazing opportunity to bless all these people out here. Um, you brought us so far with Grammys and problems selling albums and now, Lord, we get to do what we love to do, which is to perform for people. Be in this space, may the Holy Spirit be amongst us and let's just do the best that we can with your grace with us. - In your name we pray. Amen! - Amen. Amen. Get it. Kill it. Make us proud.

This story starts, in Arlington, Texas, with three little baby singers. Look at 'em. So beautiful. [Kirstin] I actually met Mitch in community theater when we were about, like, ten years old. And did a lot of shows together. But I didn't meet Scott until high school. Right away Scott and I had this really, really close hilarious bond. We just thought we were so funny and we really appreciated each other's talents as well. [Scott] When we started a trio a capella group back in high school, performed at our spring concert. And someone filmed it and put it on YouTube and that was our first experience with like, virality. [Mitch] We were like, "Maybe this actually could be something." And I think that's why Scott was so inspired to do The Sing Off. So, I joined an a capella group in college. And a lot of them had been on The Sing Off before, so they're like, "You should try out." Scott contacted us and then he was like, "Hey, have you ever heard of the show called The SingOff?" And I actually had. When Scott approached me about the audition for The SingOff, I was a little... A little wary because it was something that was totally outside of my comfort zone. I mean, just leaving Arlington, Texas alone was really scary to me. But I had big dreams and I didn't really wanna waste this opportunity. I thought it could be really something special. I met Ben Bram in the SoCal Vocals. When I was putting the group together. I knew I wanted him involved. I saw that video of them doing "Telephone" before I even met Scott. I was already thinking about, like, he should definitely audition for The Sing Off. So I talked to him about the group, he was like, "Man, you need a bass and a beat-boxer. And I already have the bass for you. His name is Avi Kaplan." So, Ben Bram, we just happened to go to the same rehearsal, ended up singing together a little bit and so he sent me the video of the trio. And it was so crazy because my friend had just shown me that video, like, three or four months ago. And I was like, "Oh, those kids are amazing. Like, I would love to sing with them. They're so talented, I love their style." And he sends me this video and I'm like, "Yes. Absolutely. Let's do it." And then I went to Oregon for my friend's engagement and they showed me this video of this guy beatboxing and playing the cello. And it was Kevin. And I was like, "That's the guy we need. We need him." And I called him up and I was like, "Hey, how's it going?" He was like, "Hey, who's this?" And he said, "Hey, we just saw your video and listen, we're trying to create a group for this TV show called The Sing Off." So, I said, "Okay, sure." And it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. I was, like, a poor college student. So I spent all my money I had to fly Kevin out for this audition. I split it with Ben Bram. And it ended up being the best investment of my entire life. I think we were all uncertain to how it would all come together. It was so many... It was completely different people, completely different places and in different walks of their life. So we were like, "Oh, man, I really hope that everyone gets along and this really clicks because it could be a total disaster." [Scott] The six of us met up the day before the audition. And we sang for the first time, we sang "Telephone". And it was just so magical. It sounds, maybe, cliche, but it was such a moment that it was like fate had brought us together. And in that song I think we really started to believe in our potential. [Avi] I... I... I just knew that we could do it. I knew that we could be something special and that we could win. And we did. [Audience cheering] [Kirstin] 2015 has already been the most incredible year ever. We put out a platinum-selling Christmas record. We're on this amazing tour with you guys. We won a Grammy, earlier this year. [Crowd cheering] So, thank you, guys, so much. Absolutely. Now we don't tell you guys this story just to talk about it. We tell you guys because we genuinely just want to thank you so much for all that you guys have done for us. This would not be possible without you guys. So thank you, guys, so much, truly. - We love you. - [Crowd cheering] I feel like I could do back-flips! [Scatting] Whoo! [All cheering] [screams] Cheers! Cheers to our tour. To the amazing team that we have. Thanks, everyone. Cheers to everyone here. No, y'all did that like... You did it really good. And all jokes aside, that was beyond, um, perfect. Kevin! Oh, my God, guys. It was better than I ever expected. Yeah. Yeah. From rehearsal to tonight, night and day. Overall the show was just like great. People loved it. Like a total a capella snob who hates everything, if they came, would they have had a good time? - Yes. Totally. - Okay, good. Every moment that you were doing so good, you would do it and it would be like... Yay! Thanks, guys. [Mitch] Daddy, I missed you! - I missed you too. - Where have you been? I can't go 30 seconds without you by my side. Hold me. Is this Juun J? Yes! Thank you. What's this? Helmut Lang. Ugh. You rock Helmut Lang. Thank you. [Kirstin] You guys are lightweights, that's because you're so skinny. Ugh! Everyone tells us that. I know... You're right. Oh, my God. I just noticed that. It's super. It's probably the tenth time today. It's super weird. Hello! [Man] One, two... That one's amazing. I love that. Oh, thank God! Great. That's gonna be the super fruit. I think Travis thought this was his, but he is dead wrong. He is dead wrong. Yeah! Cheers!

Talk to you later. - Feel better, Kirstie. - Bye. The hardest part about being on tour is definitely staying healthy. For us, our instrument is our body. So when we get sick, we can't do the show to our fullest potential. And we don't have any tracks or anything behind us to back us up. And so, when one of us gets sick, the show really, really suffers. And so that is nerve-wracking, and tough. And I'm somehow always sick. And it's really sad. I think it made me a little bit more professional in being, like, "I have to be well because I wanna do my job and I wanna kill it." And, um, that's kinda the mentality that I took over. I feel like, you know, that like, warm sickly feeling - like, when you're lightheaded. - Mmm-hmm. I feel that, too. So, it's not just like, "I'm really dried out." - Right. - I just, like, feel bad.

And she made this video announcing the tour and a majority of the video she's just talking about us. She loves us. It was so really nice. All she had to say was I'm going on tour with Pentatonix, but she, like, went on. Went on to be like... Because she is an angel. And she is our angel. [Kevin] We had our early morning flight today to get to Utah and now today we're doing not only a show, but we're recording a song. So... And before yesterday, we had a show till late, so... we're working on about six hours of sleep total in the last three days. Um, how'd you make that song? I'm just so impressed of you. You have the best voice because your... You make the song. I'm like, "Whoa!" That is totally out of my... world And I really think you guys are the best band I've ever seen. [Scott] Thank you. - [Applause] - Thank you so much. I appreciate you. Wow, I almost cried, I'll be honest. [Kevin] What? Are we about to go on stage? Yeah, you know what we got here? We got some strong defense! That's what we got. And then we're gonna have Avi come in on stage left - and be like... [deep voice] "Doh!" - [Avi growls] Yes! And then Kevin's gonna come in on stage right! - He's gonna be like... [beat boxing] - [Kevin squealing] Yes!] And then Scott's gonna come down the middle of the court, he's gonna be like, "Ooh!" [Scatting] Hey! Forum, Utah. Jazz hands. Um, I feel fine. I just need to, like, actually have a rest day tomorrow. But I... I have positive energy... to get through the night. That's all that matters. You guys are amazing. [Crowd cheering] Thank you. Okay, so this is the first tour that we've ever performed this next song. But it's one of the first songs we ever recorded. And it's called "Love You Long Time." From PTX, Vol. 1. Okay, good, you know it. All right, we love performing this, we hope you guys enjoy it. Here we go.

That was something I've never seen in my life. Can you believe we get to do this for a living? I can't. It's very unbelievable. [Kevin] Kirstie, how are you feeling? No, okay. All right, I'll see you guys. I'm gonna go record. [Fans cheering] Working on the album, on tour, I will not say that it is easy. Okay, we know exactly what we have to do right? Yes, we do. [Avi] Because in the past, usually, you just focused on the show, but this one... pretty much always work. Tomorrow we want to start on the song called "Rose Gold." - And so... - Recording it? Uh, no. Arranging it. [Scott] The toughest thing about doing a capella original music, is not a lot of a capella has played on the radio before. And the radio, like, requires kind of a specific sound to play a song. And so, crafting an arrangement that could play on the radio, but holding the integrity of a capella, is... Has been a task. As you're getting ready to release an album of mostly originals, what sort of things do you think about? We have a really cool system because we're all so different. If it can get past all five of us, I feel like a lot of people are gonna want it. Because if it gets past all five of us, it's gonna be... the best possible product. Because we're all super picky for different reasons. The priority for us as a band is to not lose integrity, too. Because it's just so easy for people to be like, well, why don't you add this? If you just add the piano like this, it'll change so much... No, what brought us so far and what people love about us is the fact that it is a capella. I think the success that we've had has really validated all those things. 'Cause, you know, I mean, to have a Grammy, which is so weird still and so surreal and, you know, platinum Christmas album, it gave us the confidence to say no, we're in the right direction. Should I do like a... [scatting] Like a really long... Just as like a sample? - Yeah. - Sure. Can I hear the chorus though? ♪ ...we could be stars We could be rose gold ♪ ♪ Rose gold ♪ That's it, right? Yeah. [Mitch vocalizing] Pretty good. It's supposed to go from one to three and we end at 1:10. I like that. Cool, let's just come out and... Oh, with the beginning. [Avi] I wanna get some soup. [Mitch] That sounds good. [Scott] We're gonna go to Vail Village, the main village. Vail Village! Where all your dreams comes true! [Chuckling] [Mitch] Thank you. Holy moly! Wow! There's a Starbucks. All right, let's find the best soup in town. I want something really special. Here we are. Look at this vine. All right, let's start from the beginning. How did he do that? Oh, nice. [Singing] - [Kevin] Wait, they're at our concert? - Yeah. [Kevin] Wait, that's cool. And they got the same key and everything. I know. That was really good. [Kevin] That's smart of them. They could not have nailed the timing better. That's great. [Vocalizing] [Avi] Thank you so much. I... am so excited. [Mitch] You're really gonna like it. This is exactly what I wanna do. - Good. - One hundred percent. We've really nailed it. [Singing and beatboxing] Oh, we were supposed to be in the lobby at 3:50. - We were? - Yeah. - Not four? - No. All right, see you guys there. Sorry about that. I just realized... - Productive... - Productive day. [Kirstin] Um, so we're at an ENT in Omaha Um, they're gonna scope me and check out and make sure everything is okay. And hopefully give me the right medications so I can get better. So... All right, well, let me tell you that I caught your act - and I was pretty impressed. - Thank you. - So, that's awesome. - Thank you so much. This is what you do professionally. Mmm-hmm. This is what you do even if you have this much loss. - That's a big deal. - Yeah. [Kirstin singing] [singing in higher note] All right, enough. Okay, we'll stop there. I've been sleeping and drinking water and not talking to anyone. - Good. - And so... Good. That's all I can do really. - Excellent. - Yeah. Oh, baby. - [Avi] How's it going? - What do you got in your hand there? An apple. Healthy snack after the show. What can we say about that? But you know what's behind you though, right? Mmm-hmm. Chicago's classic. Are you freaking kidding me? Just joking. I'll pick up the apple! I was joking. And now the apple. Hey, but did you get the apple drop? - No. - No! [Fans screaming] [interviewer] You guys seem to have a really great vibe together. And I meet a lot of groups, and, trust me, I can honestly tell you not every group is as friendly or talkative as you guys are. But touring with the same people day in and day out is difficult. It wears on you whether you guys are saints or sinners. So what keeps you guys focused and what keeps you going down the path that you know that this is what you want to keep doing? [Scott] I think our work ethic. [All] Yeah. We've developed such a strong work ethic and we have about 900 things on our queue of stuff to do. And so, I mean, you know, we bicker like a family, but there's just... We're just so focused on the future... What we wanna achieve in the bigger picture, um... [Kevin] And we know that what we're doing, this is very unique in this industry, very unique. So, it's kind of, like, we have an opportunity to do something pretty amazing. You know, a little birdie told me that you guys are feverishly working away on your next album. So how much of that next album is gonna be you guys? Basically all of it. All the album will be originals. We're at the point in our careers now, we must go to original music. And we want to go to original music, we have so much to say. And I think it's gonna be quite a journey. Yes. Maybe Kevin's in falsetto. Maybe he's higher. Maybe it's... [scatting] together. [Scatting] [playing note] [scatting note] [chuckles] [playing lower note] [scatting lower note] - [playing high note] - [laughs] I'm not doing that one. [Avi] I like the idea of kind of like, changing the melody, like... [vocalizing] Yeah, I like referencing the verse. Should we end with that? Oh, what if... What if you keep saying "good night" and we all go to... ♪ Good night ♪ [vocalizing] Ooh, that's pretty. Nice, I love it. Before we let you go, I think your label has something they would like to... Label. ...give you. Oh, in the name of all things... - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! No way! Damn, that's cool! Oh, my God! That is so cool. That is super nice. That is so awesome! Oh, my God! Isn't it like really, really hard to go gold in Canada? Uh, yeah. It really is. - Wow! - Thank you, guys. Actually, truth be told, we were a whisker from platinum. Really? But ran out of weeks before Christmas. - Aw. - Next year though. The end of this year we'll be platinum and we'll be able to do this again. That's so amazing. God! [Kevin] You know, we're halfway through the tour. [Mitch] We are halfway through the tour. - This is the halfway point? - [Mitch] Wow! I feel good about it, but I am getting tired, but it's been really fun. It's been really fun. [Esther] And actually, it took me a good two minutes-- Hi. You're always getting me eating. I'm about to shoot some hoop. I'm about to do a sweet ally. Let's not hurt someone. Yay! [Kevin] Yay, homie, you got it. Miami Heat. Do they play basketball? God, you're so good. Thank you for this food. Here I go. Mmm-hmm. Oh, you got a salad? Before it was like, you know, show day, or not show day, we don't really have anything to do. We're just chilling. Sleeping till three. It's like whatever. But now, we're like arranging everything. And writing, and recording. And like, every single day. Days off, are not days off anymore. They're work days. They're just days when we don't have a shower, you know. I just think fans, like, when they like something, like, they always want that. And so they go like, "Why aren't you guys doing like live videos anymore? Like, we miss those. Like those are like more intimate. Those are like more you guys." But we don't have the time, you know. So... But I think if they see that. Like, if we show what we're doing while we're not doing that other stuff. "Oh, that's why they're not going to see the Eiffel Tower. They're not out anywhere. They're working on this album stuff for us, you know." I think that'd be really good to show them. - [Esther] You guys are ready? - Yeah. - Do you have your ears in? - No. [Kevin] Atlantic City, how you doing tonight? [Crowd cheering] That's what I'm talking about. Hey, my collapses are getting lesser. Last time I looked it was like... Like, on the floor. No! No improvement. [Kevin beatboxing] Live stream days. First live stream. Everyone like, "God. God." Just letting you guys know, like, the band, if you guys wanna tweet, the trend is #PTX@YahooLive. Let's get that worldwide trend, baby! [Esther] We just kinda can't start late 'cause there's a live shoot. Everyone's already watching right now. - Gotta send you guys right on stage. - All right. Just so you know... Come on. [Man] Live in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Live Dallas. [Crowd cheering] Are you streaming right now? Yeah. We're trending number 1 worldwide. - Really? - Yeah. - PTX@YahooLive is? - Yeah. Slay. That's really cool. It looks great. Camera guys are killing it. [Scott] So we had this idea where we wanted to surprise Mario and have him open for us at our Boston gig. And so we're making him a flier as a surprise. [Kirstin] He's gonna freak out. [Scott] I'm so excited for him. What does that mean? It means you open for us at Agganis in Boston! You're gonna be our opening act. Are you serious? Yes. What? Yeah, we already talked to your mom and dad. We're flying them out. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [All laughing] [all applauding] Whoop. Let's hear this. Whoa! Oh, my gosh. That's really cool. Hello, everyone. I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm excited. I'm all of the things. I'm gonna go on tonight, right at 8:00. [Sighs] I'm gonna sing. In a sold out arena. It's like 7300... 7200, 7300. Pretty crazy. Hello, my name is Avi, is anyone... Hi, I'm Avi, is anyone naked? [Dominic singing] - Dominic, I love you. - I love you. I like him a lot. He's a really good guy and a great singer. Sings like a freaking angel. Cool, shall we walk? Yeah, probably. Okay. Here we go. Are you excited? I'm so excited. Oh, my gosh. Kill it. I'll be watching! Love you. Of course. [James] Good luck, Mario! Thanks, James. [Kirstin] Go kill it! Thanks, Kirstie. Love you. All right? You ready? Have a great show. All right. Thank you, guys. [Crowd cheering] All right.

You know, we won a TV show where it's, you know, a capella pitted against a capella, but now it's this kind of this small genre where I guess the small things that we do, competing against the world, if you will. That's what we're doing now. And it's a lot more... It's a lot more daunting. Because this is like real life, you know. Can we make this dream that has been... I mean, in the back of our minds, like a true reality. That's the competition I think that really we thrive on now. Okay, everybody listen up. This is the good part of the gig. [All cheering] [Kevin] Oh, shoot. Which one of you wants it? [Kirstin] I'm gonna fight for it. When we gave you the gold plaque last fall, it was like, "Okay, this is a down-payment." Platinum record. And in the business... It's kinda interesting. We don't give enough of these away anymore. So this is really... Probably as special for us as this is for you. But you guys have your first platinum album. [All cheering] Obviously, one for all of you. We just got a platinum plaque awarded to us from RCA and it's literally the best feeling in the world. Man, listen, we're having a private rehearsal. You can't be... You can't be here. I'm sorry, man. You can't be here right now. Nah, come in, James. What's up? Yo, yo, yo. Welcome to our work space.

And we have two shows left of the On My Way Home tour. How crazy is that? It went by so quickly. This one went by faster than any other... I agree. Probably 'cause the show is the most fun. What is something you missed while you were on tour? - Cat. - My dog. - Friends. - My home. - My pillow. - Bed. - Loved ones. - My friends. Parents. [Avi] The hardest part about being on the road for me, just not being able to see the people that I always want to see. Oh, it's so hard to let go. But it's always so good to see you, too. When's next I'll see you guys? Probably not for a couple of months. We'll be here on your birthday. He's gonna be in Europe. Or you'll hear from us. I'll see you guys as soon as possible. Bye. Be safe. Okay, I'm leaving now. Here, I'll take you. Yeah, that's why I'm taking you. We put so much into this band, which is a beautiful thing, but it's also a really tough thing because... you don't get to see your friends. You don't get to see your family. I can't even say, "Hey, Mom, I'm coming home for Hanukkah. I'm coming home for Christmas. I'm coming home for Thanksgiving." Like, I can't guarantee her that, which is, like... [sniffling] That's a tough thing. But, at the end of the day, when I go to sleep, I know that I have and we all have... changed people's lives with music. And that is why we were put here. And that's why we continue to do what we do. "Standing By", it is just... my message. And the group's message to our friends and family. That it doesn't matter where I'm at in the world. Like, my heart is with you. And basically the phrase, "I'm standing by." What that means is that I'm always here, but everyone has their own version of that that they struggle with. Whether it's someone that they lost or someone that they love that they just can't be with, you just... You're standing by. And so, for me personally, when I sing that song every single time I sing"Standing By", I close my eyes. And I think of my mom and I think of my dad and my friends. And I open my eyes. And I see the crowd and the reason why I'm not with them. And it's just...

[Avi] You know, it's funny, I feel like, there's "Standing By" and then there's "On My Way Home." After being without that person or without that thing or whatever it may be that you are standing by for, you are... [chuckling] You're on your way. And when we sing that song, we are on our way home. And this whole tour, we were literally on our way home. Even though Texas isn't my home, it is where the group started. And I feel like it is a part of me as well. [Scott] Oh, my God. [Mitch] Why? What's wrong with them? Good I think they're awesome. [Mitch's dad] This was actually the very first thing that Mitch ever sang to. And he was like three years old. And I was like, my gosh he's on key! And when he was about eight years old he was in a play. Then at the end. He sang "America." And his mom and I were in tears. We had no idea he could sing like that. Because he wouldn't sing in front of us. We would sit in the living room and ask him to sing for us, he would go behind the fireplace and sing back there because he was too shy to come out in the front and let us see him. So, times have changed. [Laughs] Pretty crazy. They used to have these at the state fair, and I would win them. You won a lot. Like... Like I know. It was that really easy one where you pop a balloon with a dart. Oh, okay. Okay, let's go. Parking? Oh, in the front of the school? Yeah. I know that's not my choir. Hold on, I gotta call Scott. [Kristin speaking indistinctly over phone] Oh! Uh... I don't know. [Scott] So, we're heading to Martin High School. Which is where, in a way, Pentatonix really began. This is a blast from the past. Oh, my God. I haven't been here in so long. We arranged "Telephone", right in here. Oh, yeah. It was this one. No, that one. [Scott] It was this one. You're right. This is... This is where it all began. What is it now? Oh, yeah. Great. - Still there. - There it is. This is where it all began. And then... Oh, my gosh! This is what was crazy. We, like, didn't really like it that much, our arrangement. And we walked out and Kayla Medlow and Kelly Nicholas were like... What y'all doing? We just arranged something, but we didn't like it and they were like, "No, sing it for us." And so we sang it for them and they were like, "It was amazing." - And we're like, "Oh, maybe it is good." - We're like, "Okay." So, without them Pentatonix wouldn't exist. Thanks, Kelly and Kayla. Thanks, Kelly and Kayla. And then Miss O wanted us to sing it at the choir concert, or it really wouldn't have existed, because then Mariah James' brother wouldn't have posted the video. A million planets had to line up. Thanks high school friends! And brothers of high school friends. Can they take pictures? Yeah, yeah... [indistinct conversations] Y'all have heard of Pentatonix, right? [Students] Yes! [Kirstin] My, like, choir teacher is here from high school. And, like... Oh, my... My music teacher from elementary is here too. And, like, a lot of my elementary school and my second grade teacher is here, And, I love that, that's really awesome, but it always makes meso nervous. Because I just, like, wanna do well and wanna make them proud. Love your shirt. Thank you. Thought it was appropriate for the last night. Why didn't I get that? In fact, they're gonna be crazy tonight. - Okay. - Hey. More parents. How are y'all doing? Ready for the last show of the concert. Your last concert of the tour. In Texas. And I rode on a ride at Busch Gardens with the guy that films the video board every place. Oh, really? Says it takes him about an hour for him and his crew to put it all together. I couldn't believe they had all this stuff now. This is crazy. Last sound check. [Beatboxing] Last show. Last show. Last show. That's going to be sick. [Kirstin] Can we do like fierce catwalk? Last show. Last show. We can do... We can do a fierce catwalk. After you, sir. - Now he does it. - That's incredible. I'll do my cape. Yes, yes... ...and none of y'all saw it. I saw everything. [Esther] Is the staging set? Oh, no, we should've done... Let's do it. ...standing by. [Avi] Are you gonna watch? [Esther] Yeah, I'm gonna watch. Yeah. Hell yeah, I'm gonna watch. Yes, sir. [Kevin] Here we go! [Kristin] Kill it. On My Way Home. It ends tonight. We're doing it. [Beatboxing] [crowd cheering loudly] [singing "Rather Be"] ♪ Take a look inside ♪ ♪ No place I'd rather be ♪ ♪ I'm on my way ♪ [vocalizing and beatboxing] [Avi] We wanna tell you guys a little story. That you guys actually might know, but that's okay. This story begins in Arlington, Texas. With three little baby singers right there. Oh, boy. All right. [Scott] During the story moment I was just, in my head thinking about so many things. I was getting all teary eyed. I was not paying attention. Hey, no, it's been great. It's been... Yeah, the energy's good, it feels good and it's just, like, you are excited with you guys. If that makes sense. Totally. It's a good feel. I was nervous when we first started. Me too, I was really nervous. It is so crazy because my eyesight is like when I was eight years old. My voice teacher, my parents, my sister, my brother. I can see them all. [Esther] That's kind of crazy. It is such a trip. And I'm... It's reminding me of when I did recitals and they would come. - Whoa! - I know. And I can see where I sat when I went to a concert when I was 15 here. It's like a lot. And I'm pretty much... [Mitch] Don't let your makeup run, girl. I almost got like really choked up during "Rather Be." And then I was, like, I have to stop, because the second I start getting, like... throat closing, crying almost... I'm going to ruin my life.

[Kristin] I know. When I started thinking about it I was, like... [Scott] I was so emotional too. I looked over at you and Mitch - and I was thinking about all our memories... - No, that's why... That's why during "On My Way Home", I was, like... - Congratulations. - Oh, man. Hi, congratulations on an amazing show. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. Oh, my God. Great show guys. Outstanding. So good. It was so good. That... Hi, mom. [Kirstin] Mario came and danced. Oh, my God. It was just awesome. Did you hear me whistling? No, I didn't. Oh, my gosh. It was incredible. It was just incredible to watch. I'm so proud of you. Thanks, dad. I love you. I love you, too. Good job tonight. Yes. I feel like a baby. Good last show kisses. There was just like such a connection between the audience and us. It was just crazy. [Scott] They were happy for us. And we were happy they were there. It was really, really cool. You know what else I loved? That it was our last show - 'cause I know the show so well. - Yes. So I didn't really have to over think. Technicalities... I was like, I can just live and do the show. Yeah. That's a good plan. We should definitely... You're right. We should-- On My Way Home, going home, home... Take me home tour. Take me home. ♪ Take me home ♪ [Mitch] That was our last show of the tour and I was very nervous because I feel like it was sort of my... my recital, to show everybody that I grew up with like, "Hey, look how far we've come." It was just so amazing. Being back home, looking over at Mitch and looking over at Kirstie and being like, "I grew up with these people. And now we're back home performing for a sold out crowd." It's just kind of everything went full circle. It was just so special to grow up with your best friends and then be doing something you love, something that turned into a viable career with them. It was so amazing and it made me very thankful for everything that's happened in my life. It's just cool that... That certain opportunities in life that you take as kind of just a random hunch. It's just cool that taking those opportunities can sometimes lead to what this is now. Follow the opportunities that come, because you never know where they're gonna lead you in life. And to think that us, like, who we are as people, we are just normal people. We are just blessed enough to be able to go on stage and have found each other and be able to do what we love. What a beautiful feeling to... To just do something you truly love, you put your heart and soul into and for people to love it back. That is unbelievable.
