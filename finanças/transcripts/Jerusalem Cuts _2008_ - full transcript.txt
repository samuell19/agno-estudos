Jerusalem, a vision of serenity, but the war goes on and in between the battles, walls of hostility. Two peoples with a different story to tell, Palestinians and Israelis, each fortified in its own memories, each with its own images. How important are the photos to the survival of one's story? How do they determine a way, an event is remembered? Everyone's taken photos today. If there's no photo it didn't happen. 60 years ago, there were a few to witness and take photos of the battle for Jerusalem. Five days after the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948, the battle for the Jewish Quarter escalated. Outside the walls, the Israelis had the upper hand. Within the walls, the Israelis were fighting large Jordanian forces. The battle lasted 10 days and nights with heavy Jordanian artillery fire. The Israelis surrendered and the Old City passed into the hands of the Jordanians. In 1967, there was another battle. And today the Old City is under Israeli rule. The only photographs of the battle published in 1948, were by a war photographer, John Phillips. He documented the Israeli defeat in the Old City, stage by stage, right up to the evacuation of 3000 Jewish residents to the Israeli Zone of Jerusalem. At the same time, tens of thousands of Palestinians living outside the walls, became refugees. Each side with its losses, its dead. Readers of the world press saw John Phillips' photographs of Palestinians looting Jewish property. This is how Israelis still remember the Battle of Jerusalem in 1948, the Jews turned refugees, the Palestinians looting their possessions. This photo of the little Jewish girl was seen all over the world. There were other little girls and there must've been other photographs. No Jewish photographer could have shot the pictures I did. Being a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant was no help either. Conditions were such that anyone with a camera was considered a Jewish spy and promptly set upon. I managed to get the pictures only because I was in the uniform of the Arab Legion. On the 14th of May, 1948, when I joined the Legion on the way to Jerusalem. A pink bromeliad bloomed in an old gasoline can on the window ledge. From behind it, two Arab irregulars fired away, a third jammed a fresh clip into his rifle. "The Jews must have at least 50 synagogues and every one is a fortress," one of them said. It must've been May the 19th that I became aware of the Arab Legion in full battle dress, streaming into the Old City. The Jordanians were highly trained and fully equipped. For 10 days and nights the battle raged. On May the 28th, the Israelis surrendered. "Here comes Mayor Weingarten," a Legionnaire announced, heralding the arrival of the spokesman for the Jewish community in the Old City. To my surprise, the Legionnaire held Weingarten's right-hand in a friendly gesture. At a quarter to four, Mayor Weingarten and Major Abdullah Tal set out to Zion Gate where the surrender was now to be signed. Israeli signatories were Mayor Weingarten and and Moshe Rusnak, the Israeli commander. While the Jewish officers signed, Mousa Al-Husseini, the representative of the Palestinians in the Old City, looked on condescendingly. I glance at my watch. It was exactly 4:36 PM, on May the 28th, 1948. The victor, Major Abudllah Tal, contemplating the Golden Dome at his headquarters before entering the Jewish Quarter. The vanquished, the Jewish inhabitants awaiting their fate during the brief lull between the surrender and its aftermath. John Phillips kept taking photos even after the Jewish Quarter capitulated. He managed to get the images outside the Middle East. This is how the world had evidence of the hours following the Jewish surrender. In John Phillips' New York studio there are thousands of photos accumulated over many years as a war photographer. In 1996, he left his collection to his step grandson, Andrea Carron. - This is my grandmother's handiwork right here. This is not something John would have done, get them all nicely bound in Italy. 1948. Arabs sack the Holy City. The Muslim center tried for a fortnight to keep the news from leaking out. But last month, these uncensored photographs by Life's photographer, John Phillips, reached New York and told a story. Once the looting started and there was a uncertainty about who was who and what was what, of course, he became nervous about being dressed in an Arab uniform at that point. Did not take photos of Palestinian refugees? - Hmm, not that I know of. He just took these. Now I don't know if this says, he always said that, you know, back then in the days of the photographs, he always said you know, modern photographers, they just like go They take millions of photographs, anybody can do that. Back then, you know, we only took photographs when we knew we were taking photographs of something important, we didn't just take photographs of everything. And he always said, you know, I could, if you can't do it in one roll of film, then you can't do it at all. So, you know, I think that his assignment was this and he did what interested in him and he made a very powerful, powerful story. John Phillips was born in Algiers to British parents. He started his photography in France and becomes one of the world's first photo journalists. During the Second World War, John Phillips follows the Allied Forces throughout Europe and the Middle East. There, apart from taking photos, he also makes friends in high places, King Abdullah of Jordan amongst them. Then in December 1947, an event changes his life. - John is in Rome in December of 1947. He was in Italy. He was photographing actresses and fancy things. And he happened upon a demonstration in December of the Jews demonstrating in favor of the partition and the creation of the State of Israel. Under this arch that Titus had built to glorify the Roman victory over the Jews 2000 years ago, now stood thousands of Jews demonstrating for the creation of a Jewish state. What a triumph of faith I thought. - And he's struck very much by the idea that the Jews back in Rome at the arch of Titus are demonstrating for the creation of a Jewish state again. And he decides that he is going to cover this very important story. And I guess he got the go ahead. So he ends up with the Arab Legion in Palestine. John becomes an ardent supporter of the Jews' right to their own state in Palestine. While wearing the uniform of the victorious Jordanian Legion, his camera documents the fate of the vanquished Jews. The Israeli fighters were drawn up in loose formation on the square. They wore the vacant look of men who had been under constant fire and had slept little. The Jewish civilians gathered up their belongings and trudged off to the square. It was strange photographing a people who were being uprooted once again. The first wave of refugees reached Zion Gate, borderline between the old and new Jerusalem. Once through the gate, they would be in Israeli territory. Few looked back, one wistful boy did, the frightened girl screamed. I walked back to the Street of the Jews. Arab civilians in defiance of Major Tal's curfew had come like a swarm of locusts to loot. A proud Muslim led the way followed by his wife carrying scrolls from a nearby synagogue. His daughter was balancing a carton of matzos on her head. Distracted by the speed with which the quarter was being destroyed, I almost missed the terrified girl running down the street. In her terror, she bared her teeth like a trapped animal. The ground floor of a building had been converted into a makeshift hospital. A round loaf of bread had been left on the mattress beside a wounded man who must've died soon afterward. On May the 29th, the Jewish Quarter was a charred and burned out shell. Five years after the battle of Jerusalem, John Phillips photographs come to life in the film, "Hill 24 Doesn't Answer". The first Israeli feature, financed by the owners of Marks And Spencer, it was shot at the height of the austerity years. This was the first and last film produced by Jack Padwa. The 92-year-old is looking for his forgotten film in the Jerusalem archive. Soldiers of Israel, you stand before the walls of Jerusalem. For 1 878 years, these walls have been waiting for you. Tonight, you will mount them. At midnight, we shall break through the Zion Gate, into the Old City. It was Jack Padwa's version of Israel's birth of a nation. The few against the many, boy soldiers carrying the fate of a nation on their young shoulders. Arabs, even as enemies, barely registered. They are short of food, water and ammunition. - This was real, this was. That's why I say this part of the film ought to be shown today to every single child in school. They still think we were given Jerusalem on a silver plate. The plot was inspired by Jack's own life story. A British Jew, he comes to Palestine as an intelligence officer in His Majesty's Forces. He begins passing information to the anti-British Jewish undergrounds. - Next. All right, you can go. - See where he goes to, Nicholas. Pick him up as soon as curfew starts and anyone you find with him. - Yes, sir. He falls in love with a local Jewish girl and marries her. The film's hero returns to Israel, having done his time in the British army. Shalom. He joins the Israeli army and takes part in the 1948 battle for Jerusalem. The real Jack Padwa didn't take part in the battle but he returned to Israel after the 1948 War, to produce the film. Well, Finnegan, have you got another of those cigarettes? - That was a lovely moment. Where one of our soldiers, he has somebody coming round the corner and he thinks it's an Arab and he gets ready to shoot and then, you'll see it in a second. Any little thing we did was a pioneered thing, it was never done before. We had to shoot in the old city of Agar, obviously we couldn't do anything in Jerusalem, it wasn't in our hands. All the explosions, all the battle scenes, the equipment, they artillery, everything was supplied by the Israeli army. - Get back! - We have surrender - And then you'll see this awful scene where the Arabs suddenly come in. Look, it's, watch it. This is when they cried, even today I'm impressed. Watch, watch this. The Arabs. We purposely chose Arabs not to look too terrible. You know, we didn't want to overdo it. And this is the scene showing an Arab looting possessions which the Jewish refugees left behind. - I must tell you, nobody enjoyed the shooting of these scenes, it was too near the actual truth. Look at the faces that we've found. Look at the people we managed to get together. People were crying like babies. This is exactly as it was. For Jack, little has changed in the last 60 years. As if to prove it, he flies to Jerusalem, accompanied by his son. - It's amazing, huh Papa? We're above the Old City. We don't deserve to have this. Why? Can you explain. - My dear Alex, do you know the number of youngsters who've never been to the Old City? They know nothing. They don't know anything about the history, the present history, the past history, it's a scandal. - I'll ask you an annoying question. - The answer will be more annoying, well. - An annoying question, for, and a cliche question, for a real peace, but I mean, real, what will you give? I'd give Tel Aviv. - Look, it is so absolutely unlikely that you cannot, I mean, you can't even begin to envisage... - Why? Why? Why is it unlikely? - They want us out completely. - Only the fanatics. Only a few very, very noisy, noisy politicians, Papa. - 99% of them are fanatics. Shortly now, I'm going to do circling to the right that you can see the Dome of the Rock. There's the Temple Mount. And just beyond Mount of Olives is the security fence. Which separates us from our Palestinian cousins. Jaffa Gate in the Old City. The gate into the Muslim Quarter. The Zaarour family has been running a photo studio since the 1930s. The photographer is Ali Zaarour, the only Palestinian who took photos of the battle over the Old City in 1948. His son, Zaki, shows the images still in the family's possession for the very first time. 60 years after that battle, the photos have never seen the light of day. Ali, named after his grandfather, spent hours scanning these photos. Same city, same battle. A Jordanian armored car facing Zion Gate. John Phillips photo taken a few hours earlier shows the Jewish refugees passing through the same gate to the Israeli Zone. Dome of the Rock, a victory celebration at the center is Mousa Al-Husseini, signatory of the surrender. And there is more. Some of Ali Zaarour's photos are almost identical to those John Phillips made. Zaki has trouble identifying them. His father wrote notes for each photo but they've disappeared. - Nakba, the Palestinian catastrophe, documented by Ali Zaarour's camera. How do you recognize him? The negatives have been kept hidden since the photographer's death. Why has his son decided to show these photos now? Zaki tells his neighbor about his father's photographs. What has happened to the rest of the Palestinian photographs? In 1976, the mayor of Jerusalem invited John to come back and find some of the Jewish survivors and photograph them 30 years after. Phillip's managed to find and take photos of many of them. "A Will to Survive" Phillips called his photo exhibition. According to him, the images tell the story of the Jerusalem Jews from defeat and evacuation to rebirth and renewal. - Should I call him? - Yes. John? Come, this is the star of the show, right? This is him, yes, it's John Phillips. Yes. Let's get a little background on yourself, first. These pictures were taken by you in 1948. - I took them in 1948. - But how... - I was covering a war and it's very strange because for about 27 years, I thought a lot of things which would happen, hadn't. For instance, one of the most dramatic pictures but that man with a mask over his face, I found him again. I also found a man who found him in the morgue, they thought he was dead and he was tapping and they got him out. The doctor pulled out his tongue. - And he's still alive in? - He's still alive. - You photographed him as... - I photographed him. - A corpse. - I thought he was a corpse. So the nurse said, no, I know him. - See what his photography does? It makes dead men alive again in the Holy Land. Just like in the Bible. Let's take a look at some of the pictures. So this is Abdullah Tal. At the end of a battle. About to go in to the new city, in the Old City and this is a moment. - This is an Arab soldier... This is the Arab commander. What's in the background? A building? - This is the famous Mosque of Omar. In 1948. - And would they evacuate it? - You can hear a little bit about his funny, he had a very particular kind of accent, John, and nobody could quite figured out where it was from, from the way he spoke. John Phillips, a foreign correspondent from distant shores took photos, which were appropriated by the Israelis. But they tell only one side of the story. - I was particularly shocked by those pictures on the looting. But down here, you have got an Arab leading his women behind him, this was looted from a synagogue. These Isreali boxes of Torah scrolls. Were they ever returned? Do you know? These things weren't found for all we know. Were never found after... Not that we know, they were probably... You know, Andrea, as for the looting, there is a Palestinian article which criticizes John and "Will to Survive". It was published right after the exhibition. - You're kidding me. They say about the photos that they serve the Zionist American propaganda. - Propa-, well, of course. I mean, what else, what else could it be? John is accused of serving the Zionist story completely ignoring the Palestinian side. - The accompanying texts is an insipid afterthought to what must be Phillips views of the early days of the 48 War. Scenes of a Muslim family, allegedly plundering scrolls from the Old Quarter synagogue, that is the interpretation from the text. There are, who knows what could they could have been doing carrying scrolls on their head. John would have so loved to have read this because he would have laughed. So, you know what I mean? I mean, he certainly never liked, you know, pontificators and you know, self-important people on any side, you know so I mean to do have read this, he would have just, I mean, he would have had a good laugh. It would have been really mad. It's like, I can't believe I didn't. I mean, he, you know, he probably would have framed this, I would say and put it up on the wall. - This drawing, it was done by my son who was all of 11 years old. He did it immediately after I had taken him to see for the first time, "Hill 24 Doesn't Answer". He apparently came home, spent all night doing it. And when I woke in the morning, it was on my bed. In his Tel Aviv home, Jack Padwa goes over press clippings of "Hill 24 Doesn't Answer" which represented Israel at the Cannes film festival in 1955. - In the Hollywood Reporter, Hill 24 Doesn't Answer, a fine sensitive picture. I left the theater with the feeling that the Jews was succeeding in the world today at a time when most other patriotisms were failing because they have a patriotism, love of their homeland that has survived 2000 years of adversity. A historical document, the original budget for the film. Which I think, if I'm not mistaken was over 650,000 Sterling. This was in 1953, my friend, when a pound note was a pound note In the event, the film cost exactly three times as much. How do you make a small fortune in Israel? You come with a big one. The small one, the big one went and the small one but I'm still here. All the people who screwed me... But I love home. This is not how any of us imagined we were going to land up. But who knows, the story is not finished yet. - Gentlemen, Hill 24 has been claimed for Israel. Zaki, I found in the Israeli Military Archive, near Tel-Aviv a file which states that they have photos from Jerusalem in 1948, they filed it under Arab sources. - Then I think this is my father All the pictures. Because, he's the only one who took these pictures. First, second. He just, the only one, nobody else. It's mean, these, it's the one which from the house. If we find them, you're willing to come and see them, to come and see it? - Oh, yes, yes. Really. And I wish to copy the writing and in this case make it easier for me to see the numbers and the pictures. The numbers because each, I still, I have the numbers. Each negative, there is number on it. Still, I don't throw the envelopes from my father time. - Shalom, shalom. - Hi. - My name is Zaki. - Hello, my name is Rayline. Welcome to our archive. Thank you very much. - This might be the album, which we are looking for. - Where it was 30 years? - Ali Zaarour, see? My father. - This from the album, took out. But the album itself, a black one. Black album, not this. They're missing pictures, where it is? - We put aside, eh, according to our law, photos of dead people, we put them aside. We need special permission to see them. - But they're from this album? - We're talking about 10 or 12 pictures from this album yes. - Like you mean, like Moshe Dayan or... - No, no, no, no. - Pictures of... - Of dead. - Ah, okay. - Death people, many pictures here, now, no one. Now, if anybody, newspaper or any person want to make a book, to ask to give them picture, you do, or? - We shall ask your permission. - My permission. - Yes. If we have a stamp, we ask permission. - Best guess, we'll give you maybe somebody. - That's fine, yeah. - I will hope a card, if you need anything, call Ali. - Your son. - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. John Phillips appears in one of Ali Zaarour's photos. The two photographers stand face to face, lens to lens, one wall, two images. When photographs are looted fiction takes over reality but they never go away. The ruins and the memories.
