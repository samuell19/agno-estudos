Publisher and distributor: GO PARTNER d.o.o. Alija! Alija...! I wait for you. your MIRSADA THE MINER Alija! Alija Bašić? The manager wants to see you. You were called upstairs? Last week, 17 were fired. Without notice. Without benefits. You have nothing to fear with your experience. Hang in there! Good luck! This year, 534 victims of the 1995 genocide will be buried in Srebrenica, Bosnia. Thousands of families are still waiting for their loved ones to be found. Luckily this kind of shit can't happen in our country. It all used to be our country! For you, maybe. I don't remember it. And anyway, there's no evidence that anyone got killed in Bosnia. Show some respect! You know that half of our miners are from Bosnia. Shame on you. Alija! Will you watch the commemoration with us on TV? I have to see the manager. - Good luck. - Good luck! Come in. Alija Bašić. Take a seat. This shaft has been closed since 1945, since the end of WW2. I need you to check what's in there and write a report. - Report? - What state it's in and what's in there. Coal? There's no coal any more. We want to make sure it's empty. I need the report as soon as possible. Very well, I need 3 miners, a generator, lamps... - What for? - I can't go down alone. - Why not? You were recommended. Safety regulations. It could have collapsed. - It could be filled with water. Or gas. - So finish quickly and write the report. - What do you want? - Is this the management? Can't you wait outside? We're trying to work here. My holiday leave starts in 2 weeks. We're selling the mines. Those who aren't busy get sacked. I need at least one more miner. And I need a secretary. Good luck! Good luck. I'm here for the internship. Mining practice. Who's paying? The school? ... The annual commemoration took place today in Bosnia. Among those buried were mortal remains of 36 boys, the youngest one only 8 years old at the time of the genocide... - Is that Đeko? - No, it's Messi! Alija, take off your shoes! - Can I take the basketball with me? - Where to? School? - To the spa. - I had to see the manager today. - How come? Ask your dad. - A new assignment, some old shaft. - And our spa holiday? - That's all fine. - Daddy...! - Can I take my basketball to the spa? - Take the soccer ball! - Dad says I should take the soccer ball. - Elma, take this thing off the table now! - I'm not finished yet. - That's my cup! - Elma is stealing cups! - Doesn't she know when to stop? Elma, that's enough now, you can finish later. Daddy...! - What's up? - At school we learned about Srebrenica. Didn't you live there for a while? What did you learn? - That there was a genoclide. - It's geno-cide. 8000 Muslim men were murdered, the women expelled. Is that what you learned? - Elma...! - What "Elma"...? Not a dinner-table subject, is it? I'm not hungry anymore. - Let's go to bed. - I want to watch TV. You have school tomorrow. - Why can I never watch TV? - Because you have to get up early. Did you brush your teeth? Is there any silver in Srebrenica? There used to be mines full of silver. Dad is a miner. Why don't we ever go there? Come. One day we'll go. Sleep now, sweetie. Your daddy was born in a tiny village in the hills of Bosnia. His house is surrounded by golden fields, beautiful orchards, bright green forests. In the air there is the sweet smell of fruit and of flowers. Apples, strawberries, plums, pears grow there in abundance. Down below, in the valley flows a sapphire green river. And there it lies, the silver town of Srebrenica. Finally he's asleep. He didn't do his homework again. He only cares about soccer and basketball. That's normal at his age. Elma is sulking in her room. What will we do about her? She wants to move to the city. She says there is no work here. At her age, we had to move to another country. That's why I want to keep the family together. Did you watch the commemoration on TV? No. I had to see the manager. They say they will not stop searching until they've found everyone. Maybe next year. Maybe. Take a look at this. - You could patch it up. - Could I? And have you wearing patched-up swim trunks? - All right, get me a new pair. - Samir wants flippers. - Buy them. - He doesn't need flippers at the spa. Get yourself something pretty. And that old shaft? I'll finish there before the holiday. - Who are you? - Just passing by... You certainly scared me. I took you for a ghost. Do I look like a ghost? You're not from here, are you? I'm from the mining company. But not a local from around here? From Bosnia. I've been here for 30 years. I've lived abroad myself. Just came back recently. - Is the mine to be reopened? - Maintenance. There used to be coal here before WW2. After the war, there was no more coal. - No more coal nowadays, right? - Nope. That's how it goes. One day there's coal, the next day there's none. I didn't think I'd ever see the gate open. There is too much fear. But you have no fear. Of what? Why don't you come over for a coffee after work. The last house at the edge of the village. Come over one of these days. Hello. The manager sent me over. I'm Tom, the apprentice. Hello, Bašić speaking. Yes, I did say I need someone... I need a proper miner, not a kid! Very well. Understood. - How old are you? - 16. Always keep your helmet on. Stick to the shafts we work in. Understood? Carry this to the first junction. Afraid of the dark? My roommate says this is the zombie mine. Make sure you don't trip over the tracks. Come on! Watch your step. Careful with the drill! It's not a toy. This wall has to come down. How do we get rid of it? What's your name again? Tom. Actually it's Tomek, they call me Tom cause I'm tall. Listen Tomek. We never leave anyone behind in a mine. Neither alive nor dead. The deadliest thing we can find is gas. Now, what do we do about the wall? Blow it up? Use your brain, not your helmet. Do you know what's on the other side? It's not zombies, but there could be... gas! Check out the ceiling. Raw rock. The shaft was not maintained. It could collapse. We drill a fine hole through the wall, see if there is any gas. If there is no gas we knock down the wall. - And if there is gas? - Then we get out of here. There's someone else here. There's nobody. Just echoes. You'll get used to it. Safe to knock down the wall? - Yes. - Are you sure? Call the management. Get some proper clothes, a lamp and a helmet. You can't work in the mine like that. There's no reception. Of course not... Outside! Is there gas? The shaft has been filled up. We're done for today. Let the dust settle down a bit. Alija! It's been a while. Good to see you. Sanja, get us a couple of drafts. Alija, good luck! Good luck. They're sacking everyone, right? Closing down the mines, I heard. What about you, still got a job? - Cheers. - Cheers. I'm working in the mine up the hill. Digging out a closed-down shaft. Just an old shaft, nothing special. Up in the forest, where a dirt road goes up to the right. So you're the guy digging there. The evil pit. Ever heard of it? - No. That's why they sent you. Nobody local would do it. At the end of WW2 there was some cleaning up. - Some bad guys ended up there. - Inside the mine? Not sure. It could be just a gossip. How's your little lady doing? We miss her. - She's fine. - Hard-working girl. Just like daddy. Don't scare me...! - Is Samir sleeping? - Yes. Did you have dinner? I had beer. At the pub. You took your time there. There's something in the mine. What? Gas? Alija! Is it gas? People. What people? Nobody knows. There's no proof. Eat something, you're going to have a headache tomorrow. Ten more days, and we're off to the spa! Fuada... ...my sunshine. - What have you got there? - Look what mummy got me! - Flippers! - Great! And a mask as well? What is this? It's for you. - For me, this? - It's a shark! - A shark? - Samir picked it up. You did? And I am supposed to wear this... ...sardine? - Try it on, come on! - Okay, I will. Killer whale! Little mermaid...! It's for you, daddy. Miner. We know who you are. Who is this? We know where you live. Who are you? Get out of the mine. Who was it? Wrong number. We have to secure the ceiling before we start digging out the dirt. All of this? - Where are we going to put it? - The main shaft. First we dig out the tracks. Aches all over, right? Tomorrow will be worse. - Done? - Done. - What is it, Bašić? - The kid can't take it any longer. I need a proper miner. Weren't you supposed to write the report? - As soon as I finish. - Finish what? Did you go to the shaft? - I did. I need more time to get to the end of it. There are people inside. What are you talking about? People in the mine. Do you take me for a fool? What was behind the wall? - Nothing. But... - Nothing! Precisely. I need your report on Monday. The shaft is empty, nothing there. - We close it down and that's it. Understood? - A wall like that, nothing behind it? Strange. Who do you think you are? Sherlock Holmes? Your job is to file in the report. Understood? Understood? - Understood. - Good luck. Good luck. You, wait! I was sure he was going to sack us both. He can't just sack me, not with my experience. Those young managers have their ways. He could've sacked me! What are you going to do? Keep on digging. And if there's nothing in there? If you find nothing, you get sacked. If you find something, you also get sacked. Don't be a fool, you've got two kids. The mine isn't worth it. - Faruk... Good luck! - Good luck. So you want to get out of the mine? You want out or not? Yes. But you need a good grade, right? I'm going to write you an excellent grade. But how fast you get out of there is entirely up to you. I'm taking Elma to the train station. She found a job in the city. I'll drive her. - Call me when you get there. - I will. What kind of job did you find? Waitress. They pay better in the city. Waitress. You should find a proper profession, or study. What's a proper profession? Is your profession proper? Do you even know what you are doing and for whom you work? If you need anything, call. Take care! You're late. I had to see the manager. Again? Wipe the tracks. I'll get the cart. Tom! Get out! Let's get out. Out. Out! Apparently there are more people down there. There is no proof of any crime. The bloodstain on the wall? An old case. Probably an accident. Not at the crossing, beyond it. There's a forest road on the left. Ok, I'll wait. Are you out of your mind, calling the police? What's with the kid? He's worn out, sleeping. So that's the mine? I thought it would be bigger. Apparently there are more people down there. The mine is empty. Understood? Empty! Get him out of there, I'll drive him home. There were scratches on the wall. He was trying to get out of there. He was walled in alive. What will happen next? They say it's an old mining accident. I have to file a report that the mine is empty. And then you will close it up again? We're closing all mines. It's the crisis. It was not an accident. Who is in the mine? Traitors, apparently. Soldiers? No. They were refugees. The British sent them back here from the refugee camps in Austria. They were told they were being taken to Trieste, to the port. But we took them into the mine. All night long they went in. Nobody came back out. How many? 10, 20 truckloads of people. I stayed the night, in the morning I ran away. I was still a kid. I was a local, so they took me along. - Why don't you go to the police? - The police know all about it. I don't believe you. Wait. One of them gave me this. Tell them not to wait for me, he said. But I never found them. Everyone was afraid then. People did not talk. It was dangerous to be connected to the enemy. Even today, people are still scared, so they don't talk. You're not from here, so you don't know. Can I take this? No! What's the time? It's the middle of the night. We found something in the mine. What? A man walled in alive. There are others. I can feel it. Stop Alija, please. The shaft is blocked but I could dig through it. What people? This is not Bosnia. In Bosnia they keep searching. You said so: until they find them all. It was me who asked you not to go to Bosnia. If you had gone... ...you would have found her dead. But I'd have found her! Samir, sweetie, why aren't you asleep? I'm scared. What are you scared of? Of criminals and monsters. There are no monsters, they don't exist. You look them in the eyes and they disappear. And criminals? They are far away. And if they come here? They will not come. Where is your report, Bašić? You think I can't fire you. But I can. I have proof of negligence. The kid took pictures. Your resignation will be out in the mail tomorrow if I don't have the report on my desk. Let's go! Where's that thing you have? Just press the button. It can see in the dark. Are we closing down the shaft? If that man crawled through, I can too. But he didn't survive! If you help me, I have a good chance of returning. And if there's gas? You'll pull me back up. Do you believe in God? I believe in the rope. You OK? Call the police. Don't touch me. What happened? Accident at the mine. The kid is OK. I don't want coffee. When are you coming home? Later. Breaking news- a mass grave from WW2 has been found inside an abandoned mine. Our reporters are on the way. We expect the first reports... ... according to rough estimate, 4000 bodies were found in the mine. Our reporter is live at the scene. These shocking images from the mine are bound to horrify anyone. Mummy! Dad is on TV! ... the 70-metre deep pit is filled up with dead bodies. Many of the victims were pushed into the pit alive... Let go! Give me that! The criminals have come. Stop it. They're going to kill us all. Nobody has come. We're going to the spa tomorrow... Not true! You always lie to me! Both of you! Only Elma never lies! Stop it, Samir! Get lost! Pick up, Alija. Pick up...! Elma, where are you? Did you watch the news? Can I see your press card? I live here. Do you have a press card? No. You can't pass without a press card. Since when? Since now. What about those people there? Those are journalists. Is the miner here? Alija, the miner? Mrs. Bašić? Yes. We're digitalizing the archives, and we came across your case. You were without citizenship for 7 years, correct? Bašić Alija, Bašić Fuada and Bašić Elma? And Samir, our son. Right, here he is, Bašić Samir. But he was born a Slovenian citizen. Your husband's certificate of no criminal convictions is missing. Yes, but we clarified that... It wasn't possible to get it. The police archives in Bosnia burned down in the war. Did you know your husband well before the war? Yes, of course. We met here in Slovenia. He was 17 and I was 13. So you did not know him before that? No, I didn't. My family is from the town of Tuzla. Alija comes from a small village... Do you have contact with anyone from that village? There is nobody left there. They did not survive. Only Alija. Because he was here. There is no reason to worry. Your husband has been a good citizen. You too, of course, and your daughter. You Bosnian workers are part of our Slovenian culture. Kind of. But not everyone was lucky. Some are still without papers. At the edge of the law. Erased. Remind me, where do you work? I don't. I used to work, but after Samir I stayed home. Tell your husband we're keeping an eye on him. This one missing certificate, it's annoying. Good luck. Fuada? I'll be home in half an hour. Did you get any sleep at all? Give me the keys, I'll drive. According to experts, there are no civilians among the victims but mostly German soldiers, left behind after the army retreated. That's not true! Once the number of victims has been determined, the mine will be sealed up as a military grave. Take care of your mother. I'll be joining you in a couple of days. This is my brother Tone. This is me. Mother died on the ship. We arrived to Sydney alone. The war was over. He got picked up from the fields. The three of us fled to Austria. They did not send us back. I promised my brother I'd go back to find and bury our father. If we don't find proof that there are civilians, they will seal the mine. The truth will never come out. You don't know what it is like not to be able to bury someone. It's like... It's like a dark stain on the conscience. Nothing can wash it away. Aren't you at the spa? I've got more work at the mine. You cleared the access. Why are you still there? I have to bring air to the pit. For whom? Those people need to be brought out and buried. They are not our people. Someone is searching for them as well. Is that guy still alive? He was on TV no fear to lose his job now. Who cares about old bones? A hungry dog! What's so funny? It's your own people down there. My people? No way! Wait! We have to get rid of this. Soldiers don't have hair like this. You pull, I'll hold. It's stuck to the bone. The hair, don't you need it for identification? We need air for breathing. Get the ventilation going. Not the coal you're used to, is it? It creeps us out, too. When are you bringing them out? - Where to? - Out of the mine. There's nowhere to take them. We have get the top 600 on file. The rest will stay where they are. Someone could be searching for them. Who? An old Nazi or a traitor, so what. Not our problem. There are civilians and women. Is that not our problem? Mind your own business. It's better for you. I knew it. But it's not real proof. If we had a hundred of these... I could climb down into the pit and get more. - No! It's not worth it. And your father? I found him. He is down there. You don't know that. - I know it. - You don't. - I do. - No! I do know. I'm going back home. Bašić. We received the blueprint how to finish. At last! You're going to reconstruct the wall. The wall? It stinks all the way out of the mine. How will the people be carried out? They will not. It's a military grave. It's a mine. There are women and children in the pit. There are no civillians. Experts agree on that. I've seen plaits of women's hair. There's no evidence. Our work is done. - I will not wall them in. - Then someone else will. Your department has been closed down. We found no alternative position for you in the company. You can't do that. You will receive your dismissal notice in the mail. You can't do that! Get out. Get out! Stop! All my life long! I've obeyed all my life long! Calm down! All my life long, obeyed. All my life long... I'm going home. Fuada is coming back tomorrow. I WAIT FOR YOU SAMIR I wait for you. your MIRSADA - Police! - Freeze! - Head down! - Don't move! - He wasn't armed. - He could have been. Get up! Burn that. Call him again. Unavailable. Hello. Mrs. Fuada, I have a letter for your husband, will you sign? Where's Dad? No idea. He lost his job. Maybe he drove over to the spa to pick us up? Maybe he's at the pub. Run! Dad? Are you Alija's boy? Call your sister. Everything's going to be okay, son. Why lie to him? Nothing's going to be okay! I don't want Mum to see you like that. My roommate went home over the weekend. You can stay here. There's a general strike. No train service. I'm going to the demonstrations. I want to read you something. My daddy. My dad is a miner. It's the hardest profession in the world. My dad is very brave. When he comes home, he is very dirty. Sometimes he is sad. When I grow up, I want to be a miner, too. Closing down the factories! Sacking the workers without notice! That also happened at our mine. We can't only blame corrupt politicians. Blindly obeying authority is what got us here. - Stop! Freeze! - Let her go! Calm down! Get him! Grab the cop! You look just like your aunt. Ever since you were little. Auntie Mirsada. My sister. She was special. The best in her class, she was to go to university. Then our father died. She stayed in the village, I was sent to Slovenia. I thought I'd go back soon, but I got a job, I met your mum, I stayed. Mirsada... She became a teacher in the village. Other teachers were leaving, she took over the school. Then the war started. I asked her to come to live with us in Slovenia, but she didn't want to. Because of her pupils. Then the murderers came to school they wanted to take the boys, 12, 13 years old. I was told she blocked the school gate and wouldn't let them take the children. So they took them all, the children and her. We've never found anyone. Neither Mirsada nor the children. You were a baby then. Mum and I lost our citizenship. The country fell apart. We had no nationality, no passports. I am the only survivor from my village. War is... I was afraid for you. I was afraid the war would catch you. Fear. But the war is over. It's over. Yes. We received your dismissal notice. I'm scared. You, scared? I'm afraid of monsters. You always say they disappear if you look them in the eyes. Not my monsters. They don't disappear. Miner! I called the kindergarten. They're taking me back. Part-time. Who are you looking for? Nobody lives here. They moved to Australia. Are you Alija, the miner? Yes. Come along! He told me this belonged to you. Based on a true story.
