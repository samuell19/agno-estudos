- Speak To Me - I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years. I've been over the edge for yonks. Working with bands so long, I think, "Crikey..." Pitch, or tar, or whatever it was, it doesn't matter much anymore. I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us are. Where are you now? Don't answer that. Very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad. Who gives a fuck? It's never really over. - Breathe - Breathe, breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run, rabbit, run Dig that hole, forget the sun, And when at last the work is done. Don't sit down it's time to dig another one. For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave - One Of These Days - One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces. - Time - Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown Waiting for someone or something to show you the way Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say Home, home again I like to be here when I can And when I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells - The Great Gig in the Sky - And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime. I never said I was frightened of dying. - Welcome to the Machine - Welcome, my son Welcome to the machine Where have you been? It's alright, we know where you've been You've been in the pipeline, filling in time Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys' You bought a guitar to punish your ma And you didn't like school And you know you're nobody's fool So welcome to the machine Welcome, my son Welcome to the machine What did you dream? It's alright, we told you what to dream You dreamed of a big star He played a mean guitar He always ate in the Steak Bar He loved to drive in his Jaguar So welcome to the machine Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome to the machine Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome to the machine Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome to the machine Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome to the machine I'm sorry! I was wrong! I don't care. Get the fuck out of my house! - Déjà Vu - If I had been God resistant to alcohol and less prone to aging If I had been God I would have sired many sons and I would not have suffered the Romans to kill even one of them If I had been God with my staff and my rod If I had been given the nod I believe I could have done a better job And if I were a drone Patrolling foreign skies With my electronic eyes for guidance And the element of surprise I would be afraid to find someone home Maybe a woman at a stove Baking bread, making rice‚ or just boiling down some bones If I were a drone Lay down Jerusalem Lay your burden down Lay down Jerusalem Lay your burden down The temple's in ruins The bankers get fat The buffalo's gone And the mountain top's flat The trout in the streams are all hermaphrodites You lean to the left but you vote to the right And it feels like déjà vu The sun goes down and I'm still missing you Counting the cost of love that got lost And under my Gulf Stream‚ in circular pools There's ninety-nine cents' worth of drunkards and fools - The Last Refugee - And it's also the end of broadcasting for Thursday, the end of broadcasting for 1970.

Lie with me now Under lemon tree skies Show me the shy, slow smile you keep hidden By warm brown eyes Catch the sweet hover of lips just barely apart And wonder at love's sweet ache And the wild beat of my heart Oh, rhapsody tearing me apart And I dreamed I was saying goodbye to my child She was taking a last look at the sea Wading through dreams, up to our knees in warm ocean swells While bathing belles, soft beneath Hard bitten shells punch their iPhones Erasing the numbers of redundant lovers And search the horizon And you'll find my child Down by the shore Digging around for a chain or a bone Searching the sand for a relic washed up by the sea The last refugee - Picture That - Picture yourself as you lean on the port rail Tossing away your last cigarette Picture your finger pushing the doorbell Picture the skull and crossbones on the doormat Picture yourself on the streets of Laredo Picture the casbah, picture Japan Picture your kid with his hand on the trigger Picture prosthetics in Afghanistan Oh, picture that Picture a courthouse with no fucking laws Picture a cathouse with no fucking whores Picture a shithouse with no fucking drains Picture a leader with no fucking brains No fucking brains Follow me filming myself at the show On a phone from a seat in the very front row Follow Miss Universe catching some rays "Wish You Were Here" in Guantanamo Bay Picture a seat on a private plane Picture your feet nailed to the floor Picture a crew who are clearly insane Picture no windows, picture no doors Glued to a screen in the state of Nevada To follow the dream gets harder and harder Picture her wrapping a gift for the wedding Picture her boiling the water for tea Picture the kids climbing into the backseat Picture my hand turning the key Oh, picture that Picture the dog in the pickup ahead Picture the tree at the side of the road Picture my hands growing steadily colder Colder Follow me down to a place by the river Sold for my kidneys, sold for my liver Why so weedy, so fucking needy There’s no such thing as being too greedy And discipline remains merciful. Yes. And I’m with you. - Wish You Were Here - So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade, Your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change Did you exchange A walk-on part in the war For a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found? The same old fears I wish that you were here - The Happiest Days of Our Lives - - You! Yes, you! Stand still, Laddy!

The poster bearer cried "Listen, son," Said the man with the gun "There's room for you inside" So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it?

We can't thank you people enough for the reception that you've given to this band and to this music. We need the love that is in this room to spread gently all over the world if we are to have any chance of figuring out how to empathize with our fellow human beings enough to act collectively and to stop the pigs destroying this fragile and beautiful planet upon which we live. We do believe in human rights, and we believe they should be equal for all our brothers and sisters all over the world, notwithstanding their ethnicity, or religion, or nationality. So that would include our brothers and sisters in Palestine. Lay Down Jerusalem - if you were a Muslim And I was a Jew If I were a Mennonite And you were an Hindu Would we exchange The weight of these chains Chains of belief And the carnage on the trains to turn over a new leaf If I had been god I would not have chosen anyone I would have laid an even hand On all my children everyone Would have been content To forgo Ramadan and Lent Time better spent In the company of friends Breaking bread and mending nets That was so good!
