Arabic Subtitle by: Asia World Team Translated and Synchronized by: @lena.is1023 Right. Faster, faster! Stretch your back! Focus on your fingertips, more! Stretch your back more! Min-shik, stretch your back. Yeah, well done! Gymnastics? Yup. Of all things. Do you have another hobby or skill? Nothing. Did you say "nothing" instead of saying "not"? You ill be punished with 40 hours' work in community service. You know the effort that your coach makes for you? Thank you. Thank your coach. I'm starving, I want to eat chicken soup. You must maintain your consistency. Today's lunch is chicken soup. I like to eat a lot of chicken thighs. Get lost..! You're beyond your limits these days. We're big enough to not fight like kids. Why don't you start studying again? Why not try to become a singer? Singer is good profession. "Hello guys, I'm Choi Do-hyun". Didn't you end your talk, Min-shik? You are very annoying, get out, you fat! What? Eat all the chicken thighs. How can you..? Are you two fighting now? Go, Min-shik! Choi Do-hyun, stand up. Raise your head. Show me the face of the fighter. I'm sorry. and? Ah, thank you. You like to do this? What? Want to withdraw? You want to withdraw, right? Have stupid thoughts in your head. Do-hyun, do you want to participate in the competition? We have to play a group game. If you behaved in this way, the team members will be harmed. Coach. Tell me. I don't want to do that. I will withdraw. A week. Go when you finish your community service. If you still want to withdraw, what else can I do. I tired of stalking and returning the boys who don't want to do this. Why not continue? ''Just Do it'' Just as wrote here. I see you after a week. And, as a result, end what you do early. Ah~ I don't know what to do, either. Ms. Kim. Do you remember what you ate at breakfast? Ms. Kim. French bread. What about lunch? The lunch... When will it finish? It almost finished. The doctor asks you. What did you eat at lunch? I don't know, why she asks this kind of questions? Because she is curious. Everyone wants to know what celebrities are eating. What did you eat at lunch? French bread. So. Manager, they'll understand it wrong. It's ok, Mom. Why did you call me "mom"? I mean, actress, I'm sorry. Please wait here, actress. One tablet before meals. I know, I'll pay with the card. What about you? Please. - Sorry - What? Can I re-sign? I made the mistake. Excuse me. Are you fine? I'm just worried about you. Do you know the way back home? Who are you? I'm not a bad man. Do you live in this town? Do you remember the way to your home? I can find the path through the Maps Application. Crazy. - I'm not crazy. - Hey. Why did you insult my manager? - What? - Why you insulted him? No, Mom. It's ok. I'm sorry. What is happening? I have taken your medicine, so you will sleep now. I can not sleep. Come to sleep, actress. Sleep early is useful for your skin. I go to the beauty salon tomorrow, I have gray hair. Well, I'll make an appointment. If you don't feel sleepy, do we try to count from one hundred to one? A hundred... Ninety... ninety-five... ninety-five... I'm back, Mom. Don't worry, I will not skip my meals. By the way, Mom. Have you removed the door handle of the warehouse? He made a gun with his hand and pointed it to those around him. At that time, something strange happened. Everyone who pointed to them fell in his hand. Let's go. I can live without exercises. I can live. Where have I seen her before? I don't remember. Do-hyun, live happily. Is this place suitable for a gymnast? You can leave. Wonderful, how much book here? See..? See... More than 500 books. Wow! Have you really read all this? You? We met again. I came here before you. Crazy. Crazy? What... Your saliva about to spilled out. Books were printed with tax money... I hope you understand the meaning of community service. It's normal to punish when a crime is committed. Yup. Eat your lunch. I saw a high school student borrowed 500 books, Do you think she read them all? Isn't it suspicious? Someone in your age has read 500 books, while your saliva slips above taxes. Oh.. embarrassment! Where is my coupon? Thank you, bibi! There is no rating. Let me sit down. This is the third time. I think the third coincidence means something else. I apologize for my mother at the time. You show no appetite. Is this because you eat too much mental food? Take a look at your membership card and we were in the same age. Shouldn't you be at school now? Well, I have read many books. I'm respecting you. Another book I read when I was in the middle ... I said I came here before you, - Crazy... - Crazy? I know I know. Are you athletic? Yes, you are as well. I am Choi Do-hyun. I do community service for 40 hours! You're Choi Soo-hyun, right? I saw your membership card. "Choi Do-hyun" and "Choi Soo-hyun", our names are similar. Is this fate? Well ... isn't it? Eat. Very delicious. Eat this, it's delicious! Will you also address this? Mental food. Make you feel full. I will have real food for satiety. Also, you don't need to feel sorry for your mother. I don't care at all. "Don Quixote". Where did I hear that? Where is he? He didn't return the books to the shelves. These days people have no sense of responsibility. This worries me about the future of this state. Mr. Choi Do-hyun! What are you doing here? You, Do-hyun? My God, I adapted quickly. You! My God! Hi! What is the matter? I heard that you left Gymnastics? What's wrong with you? Did you hit others? Do you know how worried I am? Stop, let me talk too. But, didn't we separate? You exaggerate! You are dead! Yes, I know I made a mistake to beat someone else, But I also got a lot of beatings. Didn't Min-shik tell you that? Did you do the wrong thing? What would you do if you were hurt? I'm fine, I am "Choi Do-hyun". I didn't make a mistake. So, why you did that? I tried to frighten him only, but I failed to adjust my balance as you taught me. I was really scary. He jumped back two meters. I didn't teach you this to beat others. I know, I was punished with 40 hours of community service. I regret what I did. What about gymnastics? Is it true as Min-shik said? Will you really leave it? It always grows very quickly. What will you do? I just don't want to do this. What will you do then? Is this because of your mother? You have to do your best for your mother. Ough, hasn't the night sky free of stars? Don't change the subject. Jin Hee, I think it's good for me to work in community service. If I move away from gymnastics, I'll think about something else to do. I would like to borrow this book. Enjoy reading it, printed with the tax money your parents pay. Thank you. Good-bye. Do you know the young man who works with me? He is 29 years old but doesn't know what to do next. He says he is still struggling in the cycle of poverty. Do you know what is meant by the cycle of poverty? You must know it, it's a well-known term. Why not read this book? What a wonderful title! But... Za... Za...? Zerdasht? That's right, Zerdasht said. What did he say? "God died". Is God dead? And established the higher person, new values. A higher person? Who live with love and fixed goals can reach the highest human stage. He said everyone could do it. - Anyone? - Yup. But it's hard to love my current life. However, if we endure our current pains and overcome them, our situation will change and we will be able to establish our own lives. Human beings. But I can't become like that. Why? I can't love my life. By God, who among us loves our life? We are not from a wealthy family. Do you want to become a writer? Someone like me can't. I just read. Why do you borrow the books that I read before? How do you know? I am the librarian. I looked at your record, and I reviewed books you had read before. Did you search my record without my permission? I apologize, I did it without thinking. You are ignorant. I learned that something like that would happen. Sorry about what I did. I thought you were different from someone like me, so I wanted to know more about you. I do community service in this place, but I'm not a bad person. You have laughed! - Book Thief - Have you ever stolen anything? Although I do community service here, I'm not a bad person. Very stunning! Have they all written? Our library looks very small. Have you heard what I said? I said: "Our library". What are you doing? Returning the book. You have to return it at reception. Don't return the book to the shelf? This is a university library. Then? We can't borrow books without an ID card. How did you come up with the book? I find it! In your library there is little poetry. Do you read poetry? You are cruel. I haven't read this book. Will you read it first? No... The loan period is two weeks, and will be denied 5 days if it is delayed in returning it. - What? - This is the first edition of the book. Version? This is the first version of the book. First copy? You, stop. Aren't you high school students? I don't go to school, pursue self-education. What are you talking about? - Let's talk. - Run! Stop! You are gorgeous! Is he still chasing us? He stopped chasing us a while ago. What? Did you know? I could not tell you because you were too fast. For all, you ... You were amazing! What? Running and jumping. I think you'll be able to fly soon. What? Are you crazy? Did you just stole a book? Do you know the phrase "healthy mind in a healthy body"? If you go to the Juvenile Court, you will be responsible. We didn't steal it. We'll abide by the loan period. This is madness. I don't remember having run like this before. I feel a good sense. Have we been photographed through surveillance cameras? I don't care at all, here we are now. Heck, I work in community service. Looks different from what you thought. Is it worth the book to keep? Must be so! You owe me much. Do-hyun, we run again? Hi. Welcome. You've been here at this time? Shouldn't you exercise? About Do-hyun. Don't you think we should do something for it? What should we do? Will you leave him alone? What would happen if he really withdrew? Do you come to talk about it? If so, let's talk on the phone. Min-shik, why you behave like that? What are you talking about? Between us than these behaviors. What do you think? Do we have a close relationship? It's his life, he will take care of himself. He told me he didn't want to talk to me either. So, try alone and do whatever you want. I'm not interested. We know the amount of his hardship in training. Did you not understand what it really meant when he said he would leave gymnastics? You know why, right? Stretch your back! Good! Good! Next one. Where have you been? Coach. About Do-hyun. What would you do if he really withdrew? Do you have a dream here, Min-shik? What? You don't. Everyone here is like you. They don't have dreams. I can't give you dreams or wishes, or anything like that. Our thought will only hurt, so we do it without thinking. So, do you think he will return? What do you think? If you are Do-hyun, will you come back or not? Are we betting? 10 thousand Wen? - You didn't pay me last time. - You bastard. Do you think I'm good at it? Do I start learning how to straighten hair after my withdrawal? It's hard for you to play gymnastics, right? Mom, do you know who I am? How can I forget my son? You should not neglect your studies for gymnastics. You should read the books as well. Okay. Mom, didn't you want to become an actress? Okay... Mom, do we have to move to the countryside as my father did? I can work after graduation. Mom? Mom? Who is this person? It's you! What time is it now? 8 pm. Has photography been postponed? Mom. Go and inquire about the order. And don' t call me "mom". What are you doing, Mom? Do you clean at this time? I've almost finished. Mom, did you remove the knob? My dear, I don't feel comfortable in this house. Mom, please wait for me. Mom. Okay. Have you seen this? Let's go! Do you hold it? Hold it well! Well done. Let's go together! I think it's here. The navigation application is very accurate. Here it is. Wonderful! This is wonderul! Have you ever traveled before? Travel? I didn't even try school trips. Really? We athletes are very busy. Do you want to travel? Yes, anywhere other than this. You are unique from your kind. Me? Is this because you read many books? I don't know cause I am ignorant, but you are different from others. Is this because you didn't go to school? Why are you studying alone? I'm not a lover of morning. No one will go to school if that is the case. When did gymnastics start? Is it not difficult? I've left it. Really? I'm not eligible for it. Should I leave school and rely on myself? Will I be as special as you? Why do you leave Gymnastics? If I told you why, would you tell me why you left school? It has come again. It came! It is luminous as well! Extremely huge! Are you want sit here? The weather is cold. Bring a warm drink. Could I leave you alone? Go. Well, I'll be back quickly, you have to stay here, have we agreed? Hey you! - Me? - Are you a journalist? Sorry? Give me your camera. - Why? - You took pictures in secret! What do you mean? - Why are you secretly take pictures of someone? Who is this lady? Give me your camera! No. Why? Give it to me! Give it to me! My God! Stop! What's wrong with you? Hello? I can't hear you. Higher, well. Okay. Yup. Do you know how much it costs? You can't even imagine it. Did you hit her? What will happen if she was hit? Do you defend what she did? What wrong did she does? Alzheimer's patients should stay at home. - Do not let her hurt others. - What? Foolish. - Foolish? Yes, foolish! Stop yelling! Sir, my sister really doesn't know that. Will you settle with us? Sir, be a companion to them. See how weak she is. Don't you know this actress? Is this "Kim Yun Hei"? I really do not know. Mom, are you okay? Why are you late? I'm sorry. Did you get hurt? I want to go home. Well, let's go. It is convenient that we have dealt with him easily. I will make money and pay you. Okay. Who is she? Is she your Sweetheart? No, we were together when you contacted me and came with me because she was concerned. Hello, I'm Do-hyun's aunt. Nice to meet you. Are you fine? What's your name? My name... My name... Soo-hyun. What happened? Soo-hyun? We'll ask for a taxi, and you take her to her house. It is not so, my aunt. It's OK, I live near here. I came because I was worried. You must be surprised, to meet. See you later, Do-hyun. Okay, see you. Mom? Please take me home. Looks like an adult. So what am I? Am I child? Still a child. When will your community service end? In two days. This must not be repeated, do you understand? You are an athlete, take good care of yourself. Someone else will not care about you. Do I have to come to your school? I want to meet your coach. It's okay, I'm not a kid. But you are. Take your time. Do-hyun, my husband will move to another area. So, I have to leave soon. I thought about it a lot at the police station. Later, I won't be here and you won't be able to take care of her alone. We can't keep her alone in the house. Do you understand what I mean? We send your mother to the nursing home. We can get a government subsidy and I'll pay some money too. I think she would like that as well. What do you think? Look at this, isn't it beautiful? Hey..! "Thus spoke Zerdasht" Isn't the title so strange? What? What did he say? Do you dream often? Do you wake up in the middle of your sleep? I am trying. For the house, I had to agree, but I think ... If you stay there, you will continue to remember. This is not good for you. I see. That day, why did you do? Your mother was very worried about you. What happened? That lady. Her eyes are like ... Who? Do-hyun's mother. Her eyes are very familiar. That lady asked me about my name, and then... I couldn't remember my name. Dear, bring me a pack of cigarettes as well. Do-hyun. Dad. What brings you here suddenly? Already become the national team's squad? Dad, Mom was sent to the nursing home. Good idea. You had to do it early. If you stay beside her, you won't be able to do your job properly. What a wonderful physic! You became a gymnast. Look well. What? Do you look bad? Do you draw people? Yes, I'm drawing people too. Isn't that surprising? You should visit my gallery this time. Last time you didn't come. Okay. Is this because of our meeting after a while? I'm not as I used to be. Has something happened to you? No, nothing. You and I, our relationship seems more and more vague. Our different ways, we can't communicate together as we were. We don't have things to talking about, right? We were talking a lot together in the past. Were we? Are you dating now? You have to make the effort in dating as well. The man should meet a good woman. Like you, Dad? You bastard. Will you leave now? Have dinner with us. No, I already have plans. But, you came after a long time. I had to go back early. Wait. I bought this. What is this? You was in a hurry, that's what I thought. Thank you, will be useful to me. Do not hurt. Did I buy the wrong thing? I had to buy red ginseng. We are in the countryside, so there are no shopping malls here. All right, thank you. Repeat your visit, I will prepare grilled meat next time. I will buy red ginseng as well. Well ... I'm sorry. Sorry for what? See you soon, be careful. Are we going somewhere? Yup. Where are we going? Listen to me. We will not go home. We'll go to the nursing home. There are lots of friends there. I have you. I won't come to visit you. Why? If you go there, you'll have a lot of friends. I love the house, I hate the hospital. You don't have to do this. I'm not going. I don't want to go. Do you give up on me? Impossible, it isn't. Impossible, it isn't. Call my manager. How is your mother? Is she OK? Yup. It's very beautiful. She was an actress. Really? Long ago, when we were young. She still can act. She has Alzheimer's disease, which is why she quit. Alzheimer's erases modern memories first. In the end, one's best memories will last longer in his memory. Currently, she is still an actress. When I look at her, I think she is still happy. She didn't have anything left in reality. She has you. Do you know this? This bridge is called "the bridge of suicide". Many people committed suicide by jumping from here. - The happiest moment - So they wrote this phrase. - Not yet - But after writing all those phrases, the invaders intended this place because of its fame. Isn't it funny? Yes, it is. The minds of human beings. They want to become special when they die. So the number of arrivals has increased. You know a lot of things. I came here before. What? At that time, I was looking at the river on the side of the bridge. Suddenly, a huge truck crossed from the rear. The bridge was shaken strongly, and it seemed that it will collapse. So I got out so quickly. Then I met you. Three times. It looked really amazing. Isn't this different boy appearing in front of me again? Is it true that the meeting 3 times make a special bond? It's certainly a close bond. What do you do? Do you know the access code? A long time ago, while I was reading a book the place was closed. Then I saw the security guard enter the entry code. All parts of the library, it has one entry code. Really? Succeed! Hey, let's get together. Soo-hyun, didn't you come here with me? But, you're reading the books on your own. Do you come to eat snack here? I have it in my house as well. Want hear a poem? Here? Don't do this. It's snowing tonight without stopping Because a poor man like me, I love Natasha. I love Natasha, snowfall without stopping. I sat alone, drinking rice wine. I drink rice wine and meditate: Snow without stopping. I would like to ride a white donkey, accompanied by Natasha. Towards a remote and sad village in the mountains and living in a hut. Snowfall without stopping, I love Natasha. Natasha must come. Natasha already came and calmly told me: "I was given the important thing because it is vague, and moved to the distant mountains, this does not indicate your loss." Snowfall without stopping, you'll love the beautiful Natasha, And the white donkey wept with all the joy of that night. This is a love letter. Written by Baek-seok for his beloved Natasha. Are women affected by such messages? It is about who wrote the letter. My God! I met my dad today. Your dad? My parents have been firing for a long time. Over all, he looked happy. It looks different from when he was living with my mom. Do you hate him? I don't know. He live with someone else now, But the lady who lived with him told me, she is sorry. Sorry. Did she apologize to me? Why did she say that? What made her feel sorry? Is there a way to know this through books? No. I'll forget about it. I will end my community service tomorrow. It's really worthwhile, I feel somewhat sorry. So, will you go back to gymnastics? Gymnastics? I don't want to think about anything. I really don't know if this will help me in my life. As I was standing at the crossroads , I learned that this might happen, right? Are you afraid of this happening? Probably. You asked me before. Why I did not go to school. I have a friend. She reads many books. She reads books that teachers didn't even read. She has no mother and living with her father. Someone thought we were sisters. We were accompanied by each other daily. Sisters ... I loved that word. I was so naive, that moment. Look at this, isn't it beautiful? Yes. Yes..! "Thus spoke Zerdasht" Why did the title so strange? What? What did he say? The snow is nonstop. Because a poor man like me, I love the beautiful Natasha. Did you really say that? No. To complete my school duties. Do you like books? Why ... Didn't you read the books? Because I am always alone. Single? For single, the book is my only friend. I feel lonely and always fear, But books do not let me down. All I want is inside the books. So, I can't live without it. I was very angry. You, what happened to you? We were always together. Hello! - But she said she was alone. - Will you leave? I hated her. So, starting that day, I pretended I did not know her. She began talking less and lost weight more and more. Maybe she was sick. She left school early. I was worried about her and I felt sorry for her, So I went to see her. She hasn't come to school since that day. She died several days later. She hanged herself with the door handle. She may have read the books until she died, She read so she would not be alone, and died with the books. I was sitting in my classroom as if nothing had happened, like a fraudster. Why did she die? Maybe because of me, or because of her father. If not, perhaps because of her ideas. So, I decided to include her thoughts by reading the books I read before. Maybe I can find out why she died, when I read. Choi Soo-hyun, who borrowed more than 500 books. That's her. What? Choi Soo-hyun. As my sister's name. So .. Who are you? I? I told you, I'm a nobody. I'll take you home. No, I'll go by myself. I said I would take you. All right, I know the way to my house. I have known my town. Stop kidding, I'll take you home. No, I'm fine. Well, tell me what your name is. Just call me Soo-hyun, - I beg you. - Why? You have your own name. - Please, Call me Soo-hyun, Your real name. Also, no one is nobody in this world. Is this true? Of course. So, tell me your real name. You won't be able to go. I'll tell you next time. Just tell me. Well I'll tell you next time, you know I'm weird. You are hurting me. Sorry. I'm late, I'll go now. Soo-hyun, I mean... How I'll call you? Good-bye. It's been a while, don't you drive your bicycle anymore? Ran out of fuel, will you fill it? Why did you buy a lot of painkillers if you stopped exercising? Busy yourself. Do you upset? What happened to us? It is embarrassing. That's what I want to know. Do you really want to leave gymnastics? Do you come here to talk about it? Just leave. You, I'm not here to throw jokes. I'm worried about you too. Is it true that you are concerned about me? or do you want to complete the team members? Heck, I can't talk to you. This is good, if you stop talking. Why did you do this? Aren't you angry with me? Do you know why I do this and because of who? What is this nonsense? Do you know why bullies came to the club on that day? Do you still meet your friends in middle school? Did you forget how I acted like a thief for two years when I met them? I thought you'd been hooked up to yourself and practicing hard. So, do you think the bullies came to see me? Best behavior, if you don't want to leave gymnastics club. Good-bye. I'm back. Mom, hello. Do-hyun. Choi Do-hyun. Do-hyun. Do-hyun! Have you called the ambulance? Hang in there! Choi Do-hyun! Hang in there! Stand up! Stand up! Thank you, really. I couldn't thank you properly, I was surprised at what had happened. Don't say that. I went back to tell you something, and it happened. Is she OK? Yes, I appreciate what you really did. I went back to tell you that I am sorry. I'm sorry, Do-hyun. For what? I'm not sure, I'm just sorry. Crazy boy. Don't leave gymnastics. Let's together just like before. You must be exhausted. Text me if you need something. I'll go now, see you at school. Dear Natasha, Se-young .. I miss you. Se-young. "Thus spoke Zerdasht" Why did the title so strange? What? What did he say? It's snowing without stopping, Because a poor man like me, I love the beautiful Natasha. Bullshit! To finish my duties. Se-young. What are you doing? He made a gun with his hand and pointed it around. At the time, something strange happened. The fall of all who pointed to them with his hand. I'm sorry, Se-young. I'm sorry, Se-young, this is not your fault. Se-young! Se-young! Se-young! Can you see me? Mom? Yes my dear, are you okay? Are you fine? Mom. You are fine. It's strange! Dong-hyun. Will you leave early today? It's my last day here. I hope you don't waste your experience. The word "last" makes me sad. - Do you mean what you say? - Yup. In fact, I... I don't care. The number of our library books are exceeds 185,000 books. The number of members who borrowed more than 500 books was 264. Not just your girlfriend. Are you shocked by their number? So, why did they write many books? This means that there are many readers of all these books. Someone writes. The other reads. It's simple but important and complex, Don't you agree with me? Is that so? Write well and read well. This is difficult. But what is the purpose of writing? If someone doesn't read it, it will be just paper. Despite this, even if no one reads it, it is still a book? Since it is your last day, I will give you a secret. In fact, I haven't read any books in this library. What? Really? Not even a single book. So I read a book. It's deeper than just put your eyes on the book. Let's leave together. Do you come? Yup. We have a lovely visitor. This is my manager. I am Choi Do-hyun. I haven't seen you for a while. Why don't you answer my calls? I was busy, I'm sorry. She looks good, this is comfortable. How did you come here? I went to your house and met your aunt. My house? How did you know my house? Your colleague friend tell me at the library. But why? I am moving. Moving? I came to see you for the last time. Suddenly? You haven't mentioned it before. Not suddenly. I had to leave before that. Where are you going? Is it far from here? No, not far away. Do-hyun, thanks for becoming my friend. I don't know what to say. Honestly, I didn't have friend like you before. Of course, I'm eccentric. No, I didn't say that. This is the first time I feel this, so I don't know how to act. Min Se-young. My real name. Min Se-young, what a beautiful name. You had to tell me before, so I could call you. Do-hyun, I'll be back after a while. You will come back? All right, I can come to see you. No, I'll be back. By the way, did you return the book to the university library? No, not yet. If you don't return it, you will become a real book thief. I haven't read it yet... Do-hyun, until we meet again, you must reach the highest human stage. Are you kidding in such a situation? I'm not kidding. But I don't know how to become a human being. Honestly, me, too. Se-young, you must come back. Did you understand? Yup. What's wrong? Don't pretend ignorance. Give me 10 thousand won. You bastard. Here you are! - Do you have cash only? - Bring it back. Thank you. Thanks. - It's hard for you to practice, right? - No. I would like to see you playing gymnastics. - Really? Would you like to see me? - No, not now. I can jump higher than before. You will be surprised when you see it. Your body is light since your youth. You're good at jogging, jumping high. My athletic abilities are good. Yes, you're right. I ran nonstop. These days, I remembered the days of my childhood. As you did a nice trick in front of me, I did it when I was your age, Dancing and singing in front of television. I can see my parent's expressions at that time. - Do you remember that? - Yup. My father was smiling and my mother was crying. Why did she cry? Perhaps because of her overwhelming happiness. I don't do anything here, it's boring. I'll come tomorrow, let's go out together. Why did you cry? Don't cry, Mom. I missing you, Do-hyun. You must be wondering what am I doing. In fact, I have shocking news. I am in Mongolia. I didn't tell you this, but I wanted to go to Mongolia a long time ago. Author of the last book Soo-hyun read before her death. That person lives in Mongolia. There is no specific reason, I wanted to see her only. I act strangely, do I? I don't want to blame her.
