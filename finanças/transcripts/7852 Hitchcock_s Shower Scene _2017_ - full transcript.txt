I was 21 years old. I was a pin-up model. I was working with a photographer and he said that Universal or UI, as it was called then are looking for somebody to pose in a film. So I called and made an appointment. I went and spoke with Mr. Hitchcock and basically had to strip down. Got dressed again and then was interviewed by, uh, Janet Leigh and I had to strip down for her, too. Well, just in my underpants, but anyway.. My body was very similar to hers. So I got hired. I had to report for makeup I don't know, one or two days later and there's the red light flashing and "No admittance" and all of this. And I thought, "Oh, God. You know, here they're expecting a stripper." I was not quite completely nude. I had, uh, what we called a crotch patch. During filming with the shower going and everything it would come loose. I told Hitchcock, I said "Why don't we take this thing off?" And he says, "No. No." The whole time he wore a suit black tie, white shirt. I was hired for two or three days and wound up working for seven. It's extraordinary that it took so long to do that p... one particular scene because that was about a third of what Janet Leigh had to work for the movie. There were 78 pieces of film in about 45 seconds. Spending seven days on one small set shooting, you know, such a short scene was pretty much unheard of. Generally these days, you're lucky if you get one day to kill someone. Oh, it has to be an obsession. You're shooting that over the course of seven days that is absolutely an obsession. Hitchcock thought to film this murder separately from the rest of this movie which meant in a way that murder was now going to be an acceptable part of entertainment. There was violence in American films but nothing like "Psycho." Nothing that intimate, nothing that designed nothing that kind of remorseless. I think he knew what he had on his hands. And he probably felt like the whole film hinged on that moment that's this crucible moment. You should've seen the blood. The whole, the whole place was.. Well it's, it's too horrible to describe. Dreadful. It's, I think the first modern.. ...expression of.. ...the female body under assault. And in some ways it's its most pure expression. Because it is devastating. Women had top billing in the '30s and '20s. And that slowly evaporated during the forties. And by the time we got to the end of the '50s women were, you know, secondary in movies. And Hitch, sort of, that's what the movie does in a way, say that he's killing off the woman. And it was really the first A movie to deal with this kind of horror, trashy, tabloid stuff. Nobody wanted to make it and they went, "Are you nuts? "You just did "North by Northwest" "this incredible hit "now you want to do this like "black and white, what is this thing?" I have just made a motion picture "North By Northwest." "North by Northwest" was like the ultimate achievement in... on every level. It was grand entertainment, it was classy it had movie stars, and it, you know, it was, it was beautiful, it was colorful. So, w... how are you gonna follow that up with a prank? I once made a movie, uh rather tongue-in-cheek, called "Psycho." - Yes. - It was a.. It was, it was a big joke, you know? And I was horrified to find that some people took it seriously. It was intended to cause people to scream and yell and so forth uh, but no more than the screaming and yelling on a switchback railway. Those of us who work in the horror genre rarely wear tuxedos. This is not a movie that wears a tuxedo either. This is a movie that's very much jeans and a T-shirt. But it's told by a guy who wears a tuxedo. He wanted to stray beyond his comfort zone. One of the things he was up to is "You don't know me at all." And that's what "Psycho" is really about. What attracted you to this one then? I think the murder in the bathtub. Coming out of the blue you know, that was about all. Hitchcock was very, very aware of his competition. He realized that Clouzot had done the kind of movie that he felt that he should and could be making. And of course, when critics started calling Clouzot "The French Hitchcock.." Well, you were invading his territory then and he, believe me, he took notice. "Psycho" is really the moment where the gloves come off. It does feel like Hitch's revenge on Hollywood to some extent. In so many levels, it's, um, his masterpiece. I s... continue to feel like, the movie is an act of aggression against his fans, his critics, actors. - Yeah. - It's, it just feels angry. Like, he was hurt and he had to hurt back. The sudden violence of the shower scene in "Psycho" was meaningful to him for reasons that dated back you know, 20 years to the origins of World War II. Hitchcock thought that the UK and the United States were insufficiently prepared for the dangers and horrors of World War II. There were several moments in his movies that spoke to that. You can hear the bombs falling on the streets and the homes. Don't tune me out. Hang on a while, this is a big story and you're a part of it. It's too late to do anything here now except stand in the dark and let them come. What's the matter with us? We not only let the Nazi do our rowing for us but our thinking! Ye Gods and little fishes! One of them was "Shadow of a Doubt" only about a year and a half after Pearl Harbor set in Santa Rosa in California. You can see how in that movie he's kind of chastising this town for being naive. You live in a dream. You're a sleepwalker, blind. How do you know what the world is like? Do you know the world is a foul sty? Do you know if you ripped the fronts off houses you'd find swine? He was basically saying "America, you were way too naive. "You think you're safe in your shower, at home "with, you know, your family and loved ones nearby? No. You're not. Sorry." Hitchcock had many obsessions but one of them that he talked about with "The Birds" was the randomness of life. There is no explanation for the birds attacking. To him that was life. There you are, everything's fine and then someone gets cancer and they're dead two weeks later. Or your life is good and then you get hit by a bus. Hitchcock was someone who, for several years now was showing up on people's TV sets, on Sunday nights. The victim tumbled or fell with a horrible cash. I think the back broke immediately it hit the floor. It was, it's difficult to describe the way that the, the.. He was an icon. He was this sort of avuncular, yet creepy guy who was presenting sex and violence to Americans leavened with black humor, every Sunday night. And Americans were comfortable with him by 1960. If someone else had made "Psycho" it's quite possible that the reaction would not have been the same. "Psycho" came at a very unique time in American pop culture. It almost pre-dates the turmoil and the shock and the trauma that were to come in the 1960's with racial violence with political assassinations. I'm not saying that Hitchcock anticipated it and knew what he was up to. But what he did know is that he was trapped by his past that it was not a time anymore for Grace Kelly. It was not a time anymore for what he called "Beautiful technicolor baubles." When you look at "Psycho" and you look at those magnificent elegant, big, rich technicolor films of the fifties you know that something changed. I think that "Psycho' was his response to movies changing and to upping the ante and not wanting to be forgotten. 1959 is, that was the year of "Some Like it Hot." "Suddenly, Last Summer," and "Anatomy of a Murder." All three of those movies pushed boundaries. So, there was something in the air, culturally speaking that Hollywood was already tapping into. "Psycho" comes out at this period where we're post atomic age but pre-civil rights. You know, if you think about the horror movie violence they were science gone wrong but you don't really feel like it was going to happen to you. "Psycho" you felt could happen to you. This was the first movie that showed, yeah you can be vulnerable, naked, alone in a shower and someone who is wearing the clothes of their dead mother is going to come in and just stab you because that's what they're going to do. Americans were kind of obsessed with domesticity. They wanted to tell themselves that in their private personal domestic spaces at least there they were safe. The Soviets and whomever else they couldn't possibly get to you in your bathroom! A few days after "Psycho" begins shooting in November of 1959 the Clutter family in Kansas is murdered. Those are the "In Cold Blood" murders. You're not living next door to the Norman Rockwell family anymore. You're living next door to the Manson family. This is the new, modern American family which is v... very much inspired Tobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." The first Playboy Club opens in Chicago. The most famous sitcom stars of the 1950s Lucille Ball and Ricky Ricardo are divorced. The birth control pill is approved by the FDA. You could look at the shower scene as this buildup of tension of all of these things all of these American fears in the, of the quiet 50s. It's... it's all gonna explode and it comes out in this scene. While I was on the critic's list in New York for review. The press was all invited to the theater the day it opened at 10:00 or 10:30 in the morning with the first performance. As you went in, Hitchcock's voice was blaring on loudspeakers saying "Nobody will be allowed in after the picture starts and please don't reveal the ending." Before "Psycho," you know, movies for as a form of entertainment were relatively disposable. There was a tremendous, compared to today a tremendous coming and going in movie theaters. And Hitchcock brilliantly said we don't want anyone coming in after the beginning of this film. It changed the way films are exhibited. The reason was because the leading lady, Janet Leigh was killed off a third of the way through I didn't want people whispering to each other "When is Janet Leigh coming on?" He wanted to build anticipation. The bathroom. Something terrible happens in a bathroom. We know this from the trailer. We don't know it's Janet Leigh because it's Vera Miles in the trailer and not Janet Leigh. The minute the curtain opened and started stabbing there was, there was a sustained shriek from the audience. Like that, cons... you, uh, you couldn't hear anything of the soundtrack through the entire shower scene. So you had the screams from Janet Leigh the screams from all the women surrounding you in the theater and the high shrieking strings from Herrmann. That must have been total mayhem. It was actually the first time in the history of movies where it wasn't safe to be in the movie theater. And when I walked out into Times Square at noon.. ...I felt I had been raped. In 1895, when the Lumiere Brothers really first showed film to an audience one of the fragments they showed was of a train pulling into a station. And the, the legend has it they thought the train was going to hit them and they were screaming and it was like caused a... a stampede of people trying to evacuate this this room that it was screened in. They did not, they didn't understand the concept. You know, "Psycho" comes along and has a similar kind of impact. It's the only movie in my childhood that my mom wouldn't let me go and see. Which was kind of ridiculous because I was seeing nothing but horror films every single weekend, two of them, in fact. But "Psycho?" No. I couldn't go. As a kid when I would hear about it I thought the name was cycle. Like it was about some killer on a motorcycle. But, um, I actually got, got this Super 8 version and just, like, constantly ran the movie over and over again. When audiences saw this really likeable character. Someone who is quite relatable in terms of, I need more money I'm growing older, the man that I love won't marry me. They, they were really hooked. Oh, Sam, let's get married. Yeah, and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have lots of laughs. "Of course she's going to survive the movie! It's Janet Leigh." Instead, she takes a shower. Out of nowhere, she's murdered by... an old lady? Who I can't even see? What the fuck is going on here? He has broken the covenant of filmmaker and audience and the audience cannot wait to see more. He was a respected director and you know, she was a bona fide movie star and I think you kind of get into the thrill of that possible shockwave which obviously happened. And I think that moment signaled new American cinema. Maybe new world cinema, in certain ways. Now I don't know that that had ever been done. - Right. - Uh, you know, uh.. Or maybe there's some obscure Czechoslovakian film that did it and there's a guy going like.. - I did it first! - Yeah. I can think of things that culturally have got us thinking about that structure for instance um, the first season of "Game of Thrones" in which our most appealing character of Ned Stark is just sort of cruelly killed in front of us. Culturally, we had to be reminded of the power of that narrative trope. The reality is, he used the whole first half of the movie as a ruse to get you to this house. And the only way you're going to get to this house is if you believe that she's someone who's stolen $40,000. And that she's gotten off on the wrong freeway exit and is on this little tiny road where nobody goes by. There's a lot of things he's saying here about our society that was changing at that point. We were trying to get as fast as we could from Los Angeles to Chicago or New York. And going into these little towns was not necessary anymore. And Norman doesn't even seem to mind. He's ready to change the bed sheets every day with nobody there. One by one, you drop the formalities. I shouldn't even bother changing the sheets but old habits die hard. When she's driving off with the $40,000 she's on the road and she's in the west. There's something fundamentally American about that dating back all the way to Manifest Destiny. "Go west! Find your fate, find your freedom." Marion tries to do just that. And that's where she meets her fate. It's interesting to compare the novel "Psycho" with the movie "Psycho." The shower scene is a lot different. It's really brief in the book. So on page 28 um, here's the shower scene. "The roar was deafening. "The room was beginning to steam up. "That's why she didn't hear the door open "or note the sound of footsteps. "And at first when the shower curtains parted "the steam obscured the face. "Then she did see it there "just a face, peering through the curtains "hanging in mid-air like a mask. "A half-scarf concealed the hair "and the glassy eyes stared inhumanly. "But it wasn't a mask. It couldn't be. "The skin had been powdered dead white "and two hectic spots of rouge centered on the cheekbones. "It wasn't a mask, it was the face of a crazy woman. "Mary started to scream and then the curtain parted further "and a hand appeared, holding a butcher knife. "It was the knife, that a moment later cut off her scream.. ...and her head." The fact that Hitchcock brought Saul Bass in to work on the shower scene as its own, kind of independent thing uh, says to me that he knew that, uh, he had to do something special with the shower scene. "Interior, Mary in shower. "We see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open. "The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. "The door is then slowly and carefully closed. "And we see the shadow of a woman "fall across the shower curtain. "Mary's back is turned to the curtain. "The white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding. "Suddenly we see the hand reach up "grasp the shower curtain, rip it aside. "Cut to Mary, extreme close up. "As she turns in response to the feel "and sound of the shower curtain being torn aside. "A look of pure horror erupts in her face. "A low, terrible groan "begins to rise up out of her throat. "A hand comes in the shot. "The hand holds an enormous bread knife. "The flint of the blade shatters the screen "to an almost total silver blankness. "The slashing. "An impression of a knife slashing "as if tearing at the very screen, ripping the film. "Over it the brief gulps of screaming. "And then silence. "And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. "Reverse angle, the blank whiteness "the blur of the shower water "the hand pulling the shower curtain back. "We catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer. "A woman, her face contorted with madness "her head wild with hair "as if she were wearing a fright-wig. "And then we see only the curtain "closed across the tub "and hear the rush of the shower water. "Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again "and after a moment we hear t he sound of the front door slamming. "Cut to the dead body. "Lying half in, half out of the tub. "The head tumbled over, touching the floor. "The hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped. "One arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. "Coming down the side of the tub "running thick and dark along the porcelain "we see many small threads of blood. "Camera moves away from the body "travels slowly across the bathroom past the toilet, out into the bedroom." I think that the shower scene elevated film. Not the horror genre specifically, but film making in general. Over and over again and it keeps showing you new things. I think it's one of those spectacular pieces of work. The film is moving inexorably to that scene. You don't know it as a, as a viewer. Sam, this is the last time. I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms. There are plenty of motels in this area. You should've, I mean, just to be safe. M... mother. My, my, my mother, uh, what is the phrase? She isn't q... quite herself today. Hitchcock was amazing at setting everything up. When she's packing to go to see her boyfriend you see the showerhead in the background. And it's very specific the shower is right over her shoulder. You know, when it comes to Norman, when he t... t, he talks about the bathroom and he like stutters and he can't really say "Toilet" you know, or, or "Bathroom." And the, uh.. ...over there.. - The bathroom. - Yeah. That's what's, what's great about Hitchcock. I mean, he always, really, like tunes into those c... character moments. That desperate drive at the beginning. It's crazy good. The notion of getting clean that's her ark. She can't see because of the density of the water which is really beautiful because she's drowning in her worry and fear. The slashing of the wipers presages the slashing of, of the knife. It sort of, it's a very violent and wet and sloshy, sharp, stabbing motion. And it's a long build-up but we have no idea that the rain that's going to come down upon her later is going to include her own blood. I certainly get the sensation that the shower scene was something that Hitchcock had probably been working towards all of his life. Is he cleaning house? He's washing down the bathroom walls. Hmm! Must've splattered a lot. Well, why not? That's what we're all thinking. He killed her in there, he has to clean up those stains before he leaves. W... you really can't talk about the shower scene without talking about the rest of the film. Without the parlor scene, obviously the shower scene doesn't really work nearly as well because the parlor scene is a sort of really sad beautiful connection that comes before this savagery. Is your time so empty? No. Uh.. Well, I... I run the office. And, uh, tend the cabins and grounds and, and do little uh, errands for my mother the ones she allows I might be capable of doing. Do you go out with friends? Well, a... a boy's best friend is his mother. There's a very loaded preamble to the shower scene. Wouldn't it be better if you put her.. ...some place.. You mean an institution? A madhouse? Look how still he is. Whereas before he was fidgety and moving around suddenly he became very still. Maybe that's the moment he decided to kill her. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, he's super confident now. Yeah, he's barely moving his head. - Just his eyes - Wow. Oh, he's so angry. - And she just got terrified. - Yeah. Oh, y... you're not, uh you're not going back to your room already? "Perhaps I'll go back to my room now, Norman. "It's been lovely to chat. Terribly sorry about your loneliness." Whoa! This is the first moment that you're with him and not her. Yeah, she literally walks away from camera. - Yeah, right. - And then we're with him. - My job here is done. - Yeah. I'm no longer the protagonist of this story. There was a private supper here. And, uh.. Oh, by the way, this picture.. ...has great significance.. ...because.. Uh, let's go along to cabin number one. The painting that Mr. Bates removed to become the peeping Tom, was actually a 16th or early 17th century painting. "Susanna and the Elders" is actually a morality story about a virtuous woman who bathed in her garden and was spied on by two elder men. And the theme burgeoned possibly as the result of counter reformatory motives. It was either that or it was simply an excuse for painting female nudity. Now, the interesting thing about it is, it's about adultery. And it's fascinating because Mary, who's in the shower is kind of cleansing herself of committing adultery with a married man. In art history, there were about three or four different phases of how artists depicted Susanna and the Elders. Lucas van Leyden shows the two Elders in prominence whereas the small Susanna is bathing in the far distance. But by the time you get to Tintoretto she's full frontal. Rubens begins to take and probe the psychological intensity of the moment. Rembrandt's using the power of lightness and darkness of highlights to enhance the drama. The interesting thing about the painting is that you've got full frontal nudity of Susanna and yet the two elders are not simply looking at her they're actually groping and violating her. It's an almost a rape scene that's taking place before our eyes. It's... it's an amazing painting that he picked. It's not any old baroque painting. It's voyeurism. He removes the voyeuristic painting to become the voyeur looking in on the shower. He could have picked from 50 different examples but he chose this one because it had the most amount of information that he could use for his film. I love that there is a hole in the wall the size of his face which tells you that he's been doing this more than once and he's made it comfortable for himself. The notion that he's looking just as you are it binds you with him. And when you eliminate those walls and you're now watching him and you're watching, and you're watching together then you are in a new place where things can get a lot scarier. "Psycho" is delineated from the other works of his oeuvre by those gazes. The birds are looking at us each individual bird dead bird, is looking at us. Mother is looking at us from eyeless sockets. Dead Marion with her eye open. The stare includes and indicts us at the same time. It's a mirror image, you know, it goes both ways. We're looking into the eyes of death and the eyes of death are looking at us. And it's inclusive and horrifying. The laughing and the tears.. ...and the cruel eyes studying you. My mother, there? God is studying you, because there are a number of you know, God point-of-view shots in "Psycho" just as there are in "The Birds." Hitchcock's God is cruel and arbitrary a bit like some kind of bird of prey or raptor which is, uh, gazing down rather coldly and disinterestedly on its human subjects. In the shower sequence, the violence is directed and that knife is coming towards us so we're being punished for being the voyeurs. There are consequences to watching and being watched. In the character of James Stewart if we identify with him in "Rear Window" has a very literal, great fall at the end of it where he breaks the other leg meaning another six, eight months of pain and itchiness and not being able to screw Grace Kelly. All of those things are pertinent to Hitchcock. I'll bet you nine people out of ten.. ...if they see something across like a woman undressing and going to bed or even sometimes a man puttering around his room doing nothing.. ...nine people out of ten will stay and look. They won't turn away and say "It's none of my business" and pull down their own curtain. They won't do it. In the beginning in the movie you're flying into a window with the blinds closed so you're starting off as a voyeur. And if you think about it, if the movie's opening from the point of view of a fly it changes the whole context of what the meaning of the movie is. I'm not even going to swat that fly. I hope they are watching. They'll see. They'll see and they'll know and they'll say "Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly." I think the voyeurism actually has a payoff in the shower scene. It's Hitchcock's way of setting the bomb under the table which is something he liked to do to create dramatic irony. Hello? I think at this point, we start to wonder what's going on in his head and what's gonna happen because of this look on his face. This is so interesting, as an actor, what is he playing. He's playing, "Oh, God, don't let my mother kill this girl." Norman Bates is presented in all these little you know, encapsulated moments throughout the film and in much the same way that the murder is presented in encapsulated moments of images and compositions cut together. So, I think that th... the movie is it's about fragmentation. It is fragmentation. Norman goes up to the house. It's very important that the audience sees him leave because he is reacting to a third character that we think is in the house mother, but that is really in his mind. He goes to the stairs and he looks up and he looks like he's sad 'cause he realizes mom's not at home upstairs. Then he goes and flops into the kitchen like a dejected little school boy. Then he sits there like, "Oh rats, I can't have dinner with the lady I want to have dinner with." I imagine he must have done that a lot when mother was alive. That she must have yelled at him and he would just go in the kitchen when he couldn't get what he wanted when she was berating him for whatever he wasn't living up to her standards. There's a lot one could say about Hitchcock mothers. Are you quite sure she didn't come down here to see you to capture the rich Alex Sebastian for a husband? Now, get shaved before your father gets home. You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son, are you? When you talk about what is sacred in America people talk about mom and apple pie. Mom is good, we love mom. We are mom. We are good. On the other hand, there's something else going on in 1950's American culture and society where mom is also suspect. There was a serious social panic in America about juvenile delinquency. One thing that this social panic resulted in was this fear that moms were going to shelter and spoil children possibly America itself, to death. All of the sitcoms "Father Knows Best" "Ozzie and Harriett" where mother never did anything. All she did was take care of the house and the kids. Lunch is practically ready and David has to get dressed. Get dressed? You mean dressed up? Well, yes. You want to look nice when Nancy gets here. The director who exposes the horror of the American family in the '50s without making a horror movie is Douglas Sirk. You see, Kay, I love Ron. You love him so much you're willing to ruin all our lives? You can't really think that. What else can I think? In Sirk, it's the whole construction of the family. It's not until "Psycho," though, where the mother is literally a monster when you see her at the end. I think my mother scared me when I was three months old. You see, she said, "Boo!" I don't know how many times in "Psycho" do people talk about mother. Oh, we can see each other. We can even have dinner. But respectably. In my house, with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three. And after the steak, do we send sister to the movies, turn mama's picture to the wall? Sam! Patricia Hitchcock talks about, she offers her a tranquilizer. Have you got some aspirin? I've got something, not aspirin. My mother's doctor gave them to me the day of my wedding. Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers. A... any calls? Teddy called me. My mother called to see if Teddy called. Even in that office, the influence the negative influence of mothers and here it's on women, not on men. So, the fact that Norman Bates' mother we realize eventually it's Norman Bates himself might have, on an unconscious level, audiences saying "A-ha! I knew it! "Mom is gonna kill us! Mom is gonna be the death of us all!" Okay, once more onto the bridge. Back to the primal moment. Marion is doing her accounting here figuring out how much she spent on the car. She's making the decision to return the money. Nice little bit of handy exposition. I always write down my math. It's charming, you know. It's still an old movie, let's face it. She throws the paper in the toilet bowl and then, to cap it off, she flushes it. Right from the beginning you know you're in new territory. In 1960, nobody had shown a toilet before. The flushing toilet is a clear indication that the scene to come is going to break one or two taboos. Details are important, you know, in the building of suspense. You know that those details are all going to add up to something much more monumental than the simplicity of these shots. Hitchcock was a Victorian. Victorians thought that a bright white, tiled bathroom was sanitary. That's the term they used. His bathroom in his home was bright, white tiles. He thought that invading the sanctity of the bathroom was a cool and subversive thing to do. He did it in his silent films, he did it in "Spellbound." But showing that brightness, it was a way of saying look at how I'm defiling the sanctity of the bathroom. And I'm doing it almost bloodlessly. Coincidentally, this scene was extremely influential on a scene in "The Conversation" which I edited back in 1973. A murder has been committed and Gene Hackman comes into the bathroom of a hotel room but the room is completely clean. And he pulls the curtain apart just as in "Psycho" the mother pulls the curtain apart but it's empty. He goes to the drain of the tub and runs his fingers around the drain to see if there was any telltale signs of blood, and there's nothing. He goes over to the toilet to jiggle the handle and the toilet suddenly backs up. So it's a kind of i... inverse version of the "Psycho" scene. The toilet and the flushing of the toilet the shower curtain, the drain, all of these things were definitely imprinted upon us by "Psycho." Now, one of the most beautiful famous leading ladies in 1960 just stripped in front of us and stepped into a shower. It's like, "Holy shit, where are we going now?" Man, that must have been crazy racy for 1960. I don't even understand. Hitchcock knew that American men were curious about Janet Leigh. And so the idea of having her in a shower in a stance that seems very suggestive, was a huge deal. Seeing her full body behind that curtain it's brilliant because it's translucent. It's not transparent it's not opaque, but it's translucent enough to see her and titillate us but not enough to really be graphic yet. Whole theory is that you have to discover the sex in the woman and not have it.. ...stuck all over her like labels, you know. And, uh, there's nothing else to look for nothing to discover. Do we know anybody who turns a shower on before it gets.. Uh, I mean, I don't act that way. I don't turn a shower on... like that. I run it and then get in when I know that it's safe. And look at that almost sexual expression on her face. She's being rained upon, and it's cleansing. It's warm and she's happy and she's like, made up her mind. The natural sounds kind of put you in the perspective of you know, we all become Janet Leigh, but not as attractive. Through other movies like "Rear Window" and "Birds" he knows when the lack of music can be as effective as music. I think there's almost no moment when we see Marion with a genuine smile. There's almost no moment where, where she's allowed to feel good about what her life is like. She's happy for the first time. We're going into a scene which on the one hand is, um, quite liberating for the character but at the same time, it's clearly really what we're watching is the liberation of Hitchcock of his own repressed desires finally being writ large on screen. Hitchcock viewed the world as a very imperfect moral machine. And he always had this.. ...biblical, almost, sense of doom and punishment. You know, that befalls those that tangle with sin in a casual way. Even his most un-Hitchcockian movie which is "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" which I love, punishes banality. She makes a moral decision to take back that money, and in you know, and suffer whatever punishment will come her way. I stepped into a private trap back there and... I'd like to go back and try to pull myself out of it.. ...before it's too late for me, too. This is very important. Very important narratively because it doesn't come, uh, in the middle of a heist or in the middle of the robbery or as she's escaping with the money on the road. And it turns out, bang, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference because the universe doesn't give a shit. I think, uh, that is, um a true sign of his Catholicism and... and his sense of doom about a sin that cannot be washed away literally, with water. You know, it cannot be purged except by blood and violence and paying the price. She's punished for the worst crime which is sexually arousing Norman Bates. You know, you get this strain again and again. I mean, think of "Strangers on a Train" where Robert Walker, you know, strangles this poor girl. Again, what does he strangle her for? Because she's a loose woman who is in Farley Granger's way.. I... I mean, that's a foreshadowing of "Psycho." That's her point of view of the shower that puts us, the audience as if we're in the shower with her. It makes us feel just as vulnerable as she is. It's spraying at us and it's creating a sonic curtain. She can't hear him coming. Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you in all this rain. And that's why that shot is bad news. You know, the shots change in their level of symmetry during the course of the sequence. That's order at the beginning and then oddly, it'll be echoed by the eye, and the drain and Norman Bates' peephole through his office and those things start to rhyme after awhile in a great way. How do you point a camera at a shower head without the lens getting sprayed? Move the camera back enough plug some of the holes so that the spray shoots outward. Very simple and elegant solution. There's nothing unusual about the pacing here. It's at a rather leisurely four and a half seconds per cut on average. So it's the calm before the storm, let's say. And now here's what I would call a strange cut what I call the wet hair cut which is her washing herself with her head tilted back and then it suddenly cuts to the same kind of an angle really a jump cut, except now her hair is completely wet. This would give the lie to somebody who said this scene was shot exactly as the storyboards were done because you never would storyboard a moment like that. You think you're gonna be watching her go through the whole process in real time but that cut jumps you ahead. It feels very bold and confident. Now, we... we cut to the showerhead but it's a side angle on the shower head not this sort of subjective point of view. When we were looking at her, she was facing left to right away from the shower. And when we cut back to her we come around to the other side of the stageline. What's behind her now is the shower curtain not the wall. And now there's another cut again it's a kind of awkward jump cut. Objectively, there would be no reason to do that. But it's unsettling because there's a big empty space, which is itself unsettling. What is going to fill that empty space? The audience starts to look over into that negative space and feeling like, "Why am I looking over here?" The door opens, you see the shadow and then Norman's figure. And that's the mounting terror where you say to yourself "Oh, my God. Oh, my God." And that is the difference between suspense and surprise. The idea of menace in a shadowy figure. I think that that's Hitchcock's fear. Who is the menacing figure in A... Alfred Hitchcock's own life? By the time he gets to "Psycho," that person is unleashed. Here you see, uh, Margo Epper the stunt woman, coming toward. How do you not reveal who that is? I've been taking the rap for that sequence for 20 years now but that's not me behind the curtain. I was in New York that day rehearsing a Broadway show. Every time they kept shooting it you kept seeing the stunt woman's face. One of the makeup men decided what if we blackened her face? And so they... they tried that a couple of times and they went darker and darker and darker until they... they achieved that effect. I talked with Janet Leigh about what she thought she saw coming at her, and, and she clearly saw Norman coming at her and that's what she played. So the reality for her was I'm going to die this way by this person who tried to befriend me and I tried to be polite to. You're very kind. It's all for you. I'm not hungry, go ahead. It really does lend an extra air of horror and pathos to that moment. And that wallpaper in the background "The Shining," so many horror movies try to have that like perfect Hitchcock, Bates Motel wallpaper. This floral pattern that juxtaposed with this black silhouette of the knife and the hair of mother it's really, really terrifying. The shape always kind of tortured me. Almost like a weird mushroom-shaped head. I don't know, kind of lame to me, for some reason. I, I'd always wished that this shot looked a little scarier. When my grandfather first saw the first rough cut of "Psycho" um, he didn't like it at all He was just gonna cut it down to an hour and make it part of the TV show. Bernard Herrmann convinced him to create the most like famous scared chord music in... in horror cinema history. It's so engrained in pop culture, to where.. It, it is, it is transcendent. My seven year old daughter knows that but she doesn't know what it comes from. But, you know, she's made that joke. Like, I don't know where she got it. - That's incredible. - She has no idea it's from "Psycho." It's evolutionary, like we're just born knowing the shower scene from "Psycho." I wanted a tattoo and I thought, it must be that one cue by Bernard Herrmann the most amazing cue ever made in cinematic history. It has so little to do with harmony. It is just sheer terror. The way that music was used in movies to scare people really changed after "Psycho." If you wanna make something scary you put in those strings, and you're like.. If you slow it down you get.. What I really adore about Herrmann is the way that he realized that in the limitation there is actually a much more powerful statement to be made. He did "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and he wrote it for seven Theremins and only copper horns. Herrmann wrote, "Living Doll" which I think is one of the best scores that they had on "Twilight Zone." It's like a bass clarinet or it might have been a contra bassoon a glockenspiel and a harp. He was definitely an experimenter. He's the one who taught me that you can kind of do anything anywhere, if it works. What I think is also absolutely genius about the shower scene is that the way Herrmann spotted it. Uh, the spotting is deciding when do you start a cue when do you end a cue. It starts with the... the toilet flushing. She steps into the shower there is no music at all whatsoever. This composer does not prepare us for the onslaught that is about to happen. When Janet Leigh walks into the shower and she pulls the curtain closed you can actually hear the sound of the rings on the bar that and it goes You see the villain coming too no music, no music at all. The curtain gets swept aside, we get the first sting.. This is... this is the rush of Janet Leigh's heartbeat. From the moment that we, as an audience, completely realize "Okay, this girl is being brutally butchered here" and we see this, and the music goes.. She falls to the floor the heartbeat slows because she's dying. And then, in her last gasp that music basically leaves her and all we have is the sound of the falling curtain and her head smacking to the ground. How genius is that? That's Herrmann. That's not Hitch. That's Bernie. We used the original score um, Bernard Herrmann's original score for our temp music, of course. While we were editing the film and then Danny came and re-recorded it and it was so beautiful. It's a perfect score. When I was given the job, I mean it really was a holy scripture for me. There was one beat in a meeting with some of the producers of like, maybe because it's in color, we should do it with uh, brass and woodwinds and percussion and do it with a full orchestra, I was like "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please, please. I beg you. Don't make me do that." I had visions of a very grumpy Bernard Herrmann his ghost coming into my room and I'd wake up in the middle of the night and he'd be there going "You little asshole, what have you done?" A knife is raised up and now, the murder scene begins and the pace of the cutting it's going to shrink dramatically. And there it is, beautiful cathartic, unbelievably savage.. ...intimate and just wrong on so many levels. That... that looks awful. That... that is.. Wow. Wow. Man, oh, man. And he his way of reaching out and grabbing you by the throat and saying, "Look! Look! You will look at this." It was a perfect, stainless steel trap. You could not run away from it, it was, uh, inflicting damage but at the same time, you knew you were in the hands of a master. There was nothing to do but submit. The "Psycho" shower scene is cut very much like a... an action scene. George Tomasini was a master. What he did with the shower scene changed the language of cinema. Uh, the editor suddenly became a much more important piece of the puzzle. You had to think about a cut 'cause a cut was gonna take you four minutes to make and splice and check it. And now, you can make a cut every 12 seconds or something. The planning, the consideration, the thinking that went into designing some of these films is astonishing. Motion pictures were 14 years old before somebody got the idea that you could make a cut. Because it's violent what's happening you're looking at an image, a visual field that is very detailed and full of motion and then, instantly it is removed and replaced with another image. In a sense, the audience should kind of crash through the windshield of this experience. Hitchcock and Tomasini knew exactly where the audience was looking. They ended up working the disorientation drawing you into Marion's sense of confusion and terror. Every single cut that Tomasini does is you.. By the time you've caught up to what you're looking at in the new shot, he's already cut to another shot. It's a kaleidoscope of these images crashing into your cranium, but it's very planned, and it feels that way. It's order and chaos come crashing up against each other. - It's a magic act. Truly. - Yeah. 'Cause people walked out of the cinema feeling like they had seen, like shocked, you know, beyond belief 'cause there was nothing like that in cinema prior to that. And yet they hadn't actually seen the things that they thought they saw. That's an incredible thing. The use of the sound effects, um, that... are I think, I think a huge contributor to the violence of the scene. The stabbing sounds in particular. How do you come up with the sound of what happens when a butcher knife strikes flesh? The soundman came up with the idea of what about a knife stabbing melons? So, knowing Hitchcock, you would have to bring lots of melons and arrange them on a big table. There'd be Crenshaw melons, and you know any kind of melon that you can imagine of very, very different sizes. So, I think they had about two dozen and some backups. So, there's the prop man stabbing melon, melon, melon, melon. Next melon, melon, melon. And so by the end of it Hitchcock knew the one that sounded most like, sinew and sounded the way he thought it should sound. So, when they were through demonstrating all of these different melons all he said was.. "...Casaba." That's all they needed to know. I think the whole key to the sound of the Casaba melon is that the inner gooey part is very small and there's a very thick layer of fruit that you have to stab through. - It's very dense. - Dense? Not hollow, like a lot of the other melons sounded a little bit hollow. And I'm sure, with his eyes closed Hitchcock was probably hearing that. To my ear, the Casaba melon sounds more like dry bony stabbing, as opposed to wet, gooey stabbing. The starchiness and the thickness probably gives you, more of that viscera the crunchiness or the... - Viscera. - Viscera. Hitchcock also had them bring a sirloin a really big thing of sirloin. I don't eat meat, and so I'm nearly nauseous telling you this but, uh, in any case Hitchcock thought that would be a really great idea. And they did, in fact, stab a big, big, big slab of steak. And so that sound is interspersed with melon. And the soundman took it home and had it for dinner that night. The stabbing sound in "Psycho" is not a Hollywood sound effect it is a natural sound effect which makes it all the more horrible. You could take the combination of like, an arrow a literal arrow or an axe hitting and you add to that a pipe in the mud kind of gush and you add to that some sort of like, uh, like a leather rip and you could make the sound design stab that would feel horrible. Marion turns. We have three close-ups getting increasingly tighter to the point that now we're looking at nothing but her open mouth. The three quick cuts which makes me happy to be an editor. I've seen some of Saul Bass' boards and you'll see cut one and cut three but the idea of drawing the three together really feels like something that's, uh... uh, kind of a joyful discovery in feeling your way through things in the cutting room. Hitchcock does the thing here that he does in "The Birds" too to show something that's shocking. An on-axis cut boom, boom, boom. It's a psychological cut. People always think it's s... something that Hitchcock came up with, but I actually always traced it back to the original "Frankenstein" directed by James Whale in 1931. In a way it was the same effect because they were showing you something so grotesque something that you had never seen before. People wanted to go to the movie just to see how shocking it was. There's something called an American cut when you're editing, which is just like jump cutting into a close-up from a wide shot. And I know whenever I do it in a movie when I'm working with Sam Raimi, he's always like, tortured. He's like, "Why do you do those stupid cuts?" And I always go, "It's, uh, it's an American cut." And he always says, "That's more like a C... Canadian cut." There's something really visceral about cutting from a wide shot jumping into a, a close-up. Now we have a lower angle that is not a subjective angle this is not what Marion sees but it's maximized for threat. There's a lot of defensive shots that make it look like she's trying to fight him off that makes you feel that you're there. We've jumped the stage line here which is another disorienting thing. In violence, and in love, interestingly it's actually good to cross the stageline because it gives you that subjective sense of a kind of d... dizzy delirium. You see Norman's hand with the knife come laterally across and break the lines. It's so great because it's violating the purity. The water is going in the opposite direction of the knife, so there's all these great angles that are again, like, German expressionist cinema that Hitchcock had been exposed to in the early '20's when he first started his career. This overhead shot, it's like the whole shot is out of focus. And, you know, they used it anyway. I can imagine sitting in with studio executives now and them saying, "Oh, you know, you've got this one shot "that's so out of focus, we really didn't need to take that shot out of the edit." But thank goodness they left it in because it's such a great shot. The knife is already through the frame before we, the audience, are really able to lock onto what we're looking at. Our face gravitates to Marion and then to the negative space to see where did the knife go? They force the audience to fill in the blank. Her right to left movement carries us right to the cut and right where her face is there's the knife. That knife never makes connection with her but in my mind I see him stabbing her. It's crazy. Hitchcock is going in 360 degrees. All of these things that you're not supposed to do in narrative storytelling, he's doing to give you this feeling of complete disorientation. Every time we cut back to Norman's form we're grounded again. Back to Norman, but now we're slightly tighter. Cut to Marion, we are tighter. Norman, tighter. And then, in the intersecting water over and over again to the shot, the one shot that convinces me as a viewer that Marion has been stabbed. The knife never connects with the skin but what about this shot here? I'm telling you, folks, that is penetration. Hitchcock got away with, uh, showing my belly button on film. All the beach towel movies, you know, with Annette Funicello they had bikinis, but they had to have them up over their belly button. He explained to me that he, he says "Paramount Special Effects Department made "for me a torso of rubber. "You plunge the knife in, blood would spurt out. "Oh, it was wonderful. I didn't use it at all." "You didn't use it at all?" "No, no, no. The knife never touches the body." Goes back to Eisenstein and the whole idea of editing, uh, cutting. Montage. He didn't want a plastic knife or anything. He use the knife. He had marks on there like blood, and he pressed it against my stomach and then pulled it out. And then, in the film they reversed it showing it going in. Hitchcock, I think, it's safe to say spent an entire career thumbing his nose at the censors. The last shot of "North by Northwest" is a, is a train entering a tunnel, like a very unsubtle sexual metaphor and then we pick that up with a post coitus in "Psycho." Wow. That's interesting. You know, the Production Code Administration still mattered at that time. And then in trying to get the movie approved by the Legion of Decency. If either one of those had been a problem as far as the production and distribution of "Psycho" it would not have been the phenomenon that it was. There was a little negotiation going on. He said, "I'll reshoot the beginning. You... you can come and watch me shoot it." They never showed up. All he did was tell the whole crew we're gonna just send the scene back. We're not gonna cut one frame from it, and he didn't. He just kept basically telling them, you're prudes and you're actually horn dog prudes because you're seeing something that isn't there. So everything stayed in the way he wanted it. He got away with it. You contrast Hitchcock making a disturbing, shocking movie that revolves around sex and violence. and a deeply disturbed protagonist with a movie that came out the very same year within a few months of it, like Michael Powell's "Peeping Tom." That movie, a lot of people see as having ruined Michael Powell's career. You know, Val Lewton, who these guys know I'm obsessed with but you know, he was the master of, you saw nothing, ever. There's no cat in "Cat People." Right. Right, right, There's no cat people in "Cat People." There's shadows. There's some shadows. Every one of his films was the title promised something that you never actually saw. You never, there's no leopard man in "Leopard Man." And the most chilling murder in all of Val Lewton's canon takes place on the other side of a closed door from the perspective of a mother who is hearing her daughter get slaughtered. And you just see the blood seep in under the crack in the door. You n... you never see it, you never see it at all. And that seems to me like the roots of the shower scene. - Totally. - I would like to throw one in there. Uh, like, one film into the mix which has one particular mind-blowing scene which I would call horror, and that's "Irreversible." Yeah! And here's the thing about that rape scene. It's like, it's, i... it, what is it like, 15 minutes long? It's something, and they don't really show anything. There's no nudity, there's no nothing. It's just one shot that lingers. The rape scene in "Irreversible" and the shower scene in "Psycho" are exact inverses. The shower scene is incredibly close.. ...and frenetic. And the rape scene in "Irreversible" is incredibly distant and still. The shots of the mother are out of focus the focus is on the water, not the mother. You could argue that this is Marion's subjective point of view that she doesn't see who it is clearly because she's so confused. Very quick cutting here, on the average one shot every three-quarters of a second, 18 frames. And the audience in 1960 would be having um, they would be seeing something in a way that they were not used to seeing it. I was always surprised that they got away with this. Just the amount of like, naked breast that they were able to show. It had to be done impressionistically. So it was done with little pieces of film. The head, the feet, the hand. Parts of the torso. The shot of her feet is the very first cut of blood that we've had in this entire piece. The blood starts to spatter into the water rather than flow. You know, you see spots hitting like a dark rain and then it just is absorbed by the water and it spreads out in a very kind of haunting, haunting way. My mom loves to tell me that "Oh, you know that, uh, the blood going down the drain in "Psycho" is chocolate syrup, right? - Chocolate syrup. Yeah. So, is anyone in this room going to tell us that that's not actually chocolate syrup? They had a can of Hershey's syrup which was watered down and that's what they used for blood. But they had to dribble it around me and on me. I deliberately made the film in black and white because I knew that if it has been in color uh, the draining away of blood would have been too repulsive. The knife comes through and even though it's just swinging through frame my brain is telling me she's just gotten stabbed squarely in the back. And then, to the sneaky cut that Tomasini has put into the film. Starting here with her hand out of focus at the front it's going towards the wall. Your eyes are super confused here because you're looking at a negative space a... and just the wall tile. Her hand starts to come in and instantly there's a jump cut. If you watch that at full speed itjust looks like, bam. It ends up making it feel like she's slamming against the wall. His exit is also tremendous that quick move, without looking back. He doesn't even stand there to make sure she's dead. He leaves. It's almost like a time cut, where he's already out the door. And I think part of it is, they were really trying to hide you know, who it was. And they were tired of showing that lame shot where his head looked like a mushroom. The shot of the hand, it looks like a starfish against the wall. It's just a hand, the least important part of her body right now after she's been hacked to death. And you see the life ebbing out of her body through her hand. So, the scene becomes all about her hands, if you watch it. Hand. And then, hand. And you watch it go. Trying to grab onto something. Hand going down the wall. She turns around, where's her hand? You know, that's kind of the, that's the big question. And if you actually watch the opening scene of "Jurassic Park" it's the same thing, it's, you know it doesn't matter that... that guy that got eaten by the velociraptor you barely see his face. But what's important, and you watch is he's grabbing onto his hand. Hand reaches out. Hands touching the thing. And I think that's part of the ways that he kind of is able to bring the audience into her death rather than just, watching her, watching her die. Now she's begging for her life, trying to hold herself up. The way that her hair leaves like a trail behind her it follows her down.. I mean, it's an incredibly haunting image. And it's a wall. You know, you had depth before and now she's just flat against nothingness. Nobody did this before. Deaths were quick in movies. And although actors loved to make the most of them this is so obviously directed in such a way. You know, in "Torn Curtain," there's this endless scene of trying to kill someone. It's not bloody but it's graphic. Even "Frenzy" is fairly graphic uh, compared to "Psycho." But "Psycho" has the effect of being graphic much like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" later was. I love how slow it is, how much time it takes. There's all this negative space on the left hand side. This is absolutely intentional. Hitchcock is mirroring the shot at the beginning of the sequence where Marion is showering in exactly the right hand side of the frame. It is the book end that makes the shower scene. My favorite cut is the hand coming around onto the curtain and it's all of a sudden from the staccato rhythms you end up with this really fluid shot that has a sort of almost, kind of, poetic and sad quality to it. She's dying and there's a softness to it and it makes it just instantly emotional. It's really, really a great cut. It's... it's one of the best cuts I've ever seen. You can just barely see the outline of my breast in that shot. That's my hand. And you can tell the difference on my knuckles there. The, uh, ring finger is disfigured a bit. The nail is darker than a regular fingernail. When I was three years old, I... I reached down to help my brother on a, uh, lawn mower push lawn mower and, pssh, cut it off. This is he shot that, uh, Cecil B. DeMille actually did first in "The Ten Commandments" where Sally Lung pulls down on the curtain. This shot, the... the down shot, she just feels so vulnerable like a, like a dying animal. It's just such a, again, such a bold shot because s... so much like, nudity is revealed. There is a shot in the shower scene that was never used that is one of the most heartbreaking shots I've ever seen. Anne Heche, she was definitely willing to do stuff. That one shot at the end, where she's slumped over that was the shot that Hitchcock could not use. But it was storyboarded. There were objections to using that and perhaps, Hitch felt that it wasn't really necessary anyway. Then we return to the motif of the showerhead the impassive eye, which has just watched this horrible thing happen. This shot of the showerhead at the beginning of the scene was one of joy, she was going to get a new start. And now that same water is washing away the evidence of her existence and the murder. The water keeps running and the blood flows but the heart is stopping. It's just such an amazing image to see her life flowing down the drain. You know, what a metaphor that is. And then switches to the eye, right? Aw, come on. That's so good. I wonder how long this shot is, how long she had to hold. To get her eye to stay.. Just to make sure that her eye didn't twitch. You can t... you can see a tiny bit, I mean.. Oh, my God, that's incredible. The pointless s... spiraling of the universe and the way that everything is ultimately drawn down the plughole towards oblivion towards meaningless death. I think to some extent we are looking at Hitchcock's fears as well as his obsessions. You see it in "Barton Fink," you see it in so many movies. And you're like, why is he going inside the drain? Why is he going inside, are we going to go inside? That is the moment of "Psycho" where everything changes. This was made by an auteur filmmaker and that is a very personal stamp. It's a rupture in the movie but the movie never achieves this kind of poetry again. And you begin to realize that "Oh, this was what really mattered most to Hitchcock." Tomasini has done a clockwise turn optically which then right about here hooks back up to the 24 frame footage. I'm just amazed that they were able to get that clean. Usually, when you do an optical, it's pretty grainy. But it looks so smooth and so beautiful. It's surprising an... an... and seamless from where they go to live action. It's I... like, one of the greatest opticals in the history of movies. It's also kind of like what the title sequence is doing in "Vertigo." It's a theme that runs through this film and then later on, of course it's not style just for style's sake. It's... it's got content. The cameras were huge and very difficult to manipulate. You can actually see pictures of Hitchcock behind a Mitchell and you get a sense of what it was like riding on that carriage behind that huge locomotive of a camera. Whereas today, it's a snap. You just do it like Gus Van Sant. In the remake, he did it all live action. The pullback from her eye was a whole robotic camera move. I seriously followed the original film shot by shot. I was able to cut it exactly like the original and we watched it and it was weird and it didn't work. I said, "Well, Gus, you know, come over, watch the scene." I said, "I have a few reservations "over like, how it's playing right now and it doesn't feel like the shower scene yet." We went in and tried to make it a little more Gus Van Sant-y. To duplicate something, like as iconic as the shower scene I really think it was just, it wasn't going to work. It just didn't and it just didn't. I always love the placement of those drops of water because they're like tears. Right at the end, there's a little flicker in her eye little highlight in her eye. Yeah, and you can see her eye move. There's a tight, slight blink of the eye there. Hitchcock almost fetishistically lingers in this post-mortem moment. This is what happens after you die and no one turns off the water. Hitch had a little snap of the finger to let Janet know when the camera had passed and was going to pan into the room. It, it took a lot of takes. I could feel the moleskin pulling away from my top part. And so, I could feel this.. It was just kind of like going.. And I thought, "You know what? "I don't want to do this damn thing again. I really don't want to." And there are all the guys on the scaffolding. And I said, "I don't, I'm not going to be modest," you know. Let 'em look. Why would you cut to the shower there? I don't think the reason has anything to do with artistic decision. It's... it's the solution to some problem that he had. After my grandfather filmed "Psycho" it had been shown to all the executives. The last person he showed it to was my grandmother and they were sitting in the screening room and he's panning out and she looks at my grandfather and says "Hitch, you can't release this." And he said, "Why not?" And she goes, "Janet Leigh took a breath." They couldn't reshoot it, Janet was gone. Uh, they didn't have the budget. So they simply cut back to the showerhead spewing water. And then, that cynical camera move. She made her moral decision and this is what it got her. There's an image of the uncaring universe if you want one. And you see the headline there, "Okay." I... i... it is not okay. Nothing is okay. He always comes back to his McGuffin which is the $40,000. Then he throws the newspaper into the quagmire. It goes down with the car. And the audience says, that's j... the the... the, that's the money that we thought was important in this story. It's totally unimportant. This is the one other thing in the movie that always tortured me. The greatest scene in movie history ends on a sour note with a bad ADR line that has been the doom of so many movies. Here comes Norman just wondering what happened and oh, my, he can't believe it. Another murder at the motel. How did that happen? It's an extraordinary aftermath. It's a crucial piece of the filmmaking to sort of let the consequence of it actually land. It's not about getting the bloodstains out of the tub. It's about this incredibly laborious process that this unbearably damaged soul needs to work through. It demands not just that we watch as we watched the murder of Marion Crane but we're also voyeurs to the horror of Norman's world. For me, the cleanup represents Alfred Hitchcock's sense of orderliness sense of, I wasn't sexually aroused by this woman and I'm just going to pretend that this unhappy episode just didn't even occur. I think that cleaning always represents sexual guilt. You care about this guy. And I know it sounds crazy, but you do. You want to know what's going to happen to him. You want to know is he going to be free of this or is it going to consume him? The fact that he is able to get you to care is one of the miracles of the movie. "Psycho" obviously has influence on a whole host of movies. "Psycho" is the mother of the slasher genre. The shower scene is really the first, um, fully sexualized on-screen, um, knife attack. You have Mario Bava in Italy and he's taking the visuals of the "Psycho" scene. In Italy, in the '60s they didn't have the same censorship laws Bava takes the Hitchcock style and really creates the Italian Giallo film. Dario Argento burst onto the scene with "Bird with the Crystal Plumage" determined to present murder as a form of fine art consistently sexualizes and fetishizes the killings um, um, tries to present them as something beautiful cathartic and almost orgasmic which happens again and again in his work. Then, of course, the American films started imitating Italian films. And you get the wave of slasher films of the '80s kicking off with John Carpenter's "Halloween." "Psycho" might have also really have started the rather negative trend of victims undressing before they're butchered, which is something that haunted slasher cinema throughout the '70s. Martin Scorsese talks about the construction of the fight in "Raging Bull," with Sugar Ray Robinson. I literally got shot-by-shot breakdown of the shower scene in "Psycho" and really got my original storyboards for this one sequence shot-by-shot and shot it in that order. I don't believe film influences the culture in this way anymore. When a... a moment of violence is so suggestive so new, so unlike anything we've seen that it just becomes part of the cultural conversation and I think that's what happened with the shower scene. I'm on this TV show called "Screen Queens." I've been asked to get in the shower and take pictures before. I've been asked to recreate it. And I've said "No" every time because of course, um, this is my mother's legacy and it is not mine to, to play in. It's her sandbox. But my mother's been gone now over 10 years. And this is a great show. And it was a really respectful funny, homage. And so the Red Devil comes along he rips open the curtain but I'm not there. And that second I come from behind the bathroom door attack him and right before I do, I look at him and go "I saw that movie like, 50 times!" I went back to Chicago shot the, uh, September 1960 cover. I worked at the Playboy Club until probably October of that year. I was one of, uh, the original, uh, bunnies there. I never mentioned "Psycho." The shot I didn't like was when, uh, Tony Perkins pulls me out of the tub and wraps me in the, in the shower curtain. He picks me up to carry me out to the trunk. Well, he, he gets me up about, I don't know, six, nine inches off the floor and drops me back down because he... he wasn't in a position to pick up a dead weight. He picks me up, puts me on his knees and then.. ...and that's me. And that's, uh, out to the car and that's the end of me.
