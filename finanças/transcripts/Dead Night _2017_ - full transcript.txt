It is such a beautiful name. Casey. Casey. I could see why you might want to call me that. Okay. Mom. Sorry. She's your mother. Show some respect. Sure thing, Mr. Pollack. Stop trying to impress your sister's friends. Mom, that's disgusting. Don't get your hopes up, Becky. Becky thinks you're a loser. All right, you guys. Get it all out of your system or else you're gonna be sleeping outside tonight. Not you, Becky. You're cool. Hey. How are you? Steve's an a-hole. He knew three weeks ago, so I don't really care what he thinks. He can bring in a sub. Okay. It's all right. Go back to sleep. I can't sleep. I'm starting to pick up too much energy. James. What about you, kids? Anyone else feel that sweet energy? Your mom didn't tell you the cabin's built on a pile of magic rocks? Okay, we don't need to get into this with them. Get into what? Your mom's trying to cure me. Please tell me we're not going to a hippie commune. No, we're not going to a hippie commune. It's just a vacation. On top of a deposit of iron oxide. Don't overthink it! There are places like this all over the world. It's totally normal. Your mom's friend Mika is into hoodoo. She's not into hoodoo. It's what she does for a living. Does what for a living? Becky doesn't want to hear this, right? Yeah, Becky wants to hear this. You want to hear this, right? I do want to hear this? Yeah, see? She wants to hear this. All right, this is just what Mika told me. But she said that if you live on top of this energy for a while, then it kind of realigns everything inside of you. Sounds kind of like bullshit. Yeah, well, let's hope this bullshit works. That's it? Help your dad with the bags. I'm really sorry about this. It's okay. Really? 'Cause I thought it was gonna be like, fun in the mountains, not weird, creepy energy house. Seriously, it is fun. And creepy. Oh, Mika says that the front door is gonna be locked. We have to go around the side. It's supposed to be cooler on the inside. Well, by cooler, I hope you mean warmer because it's freezing. All right, buddy. Let me look at this place. What do you think? Well, it's a house. What do you think? Kind of rustic. Wait 'til we get the fire going. It's nice. Honey, go open the front door and help your brother with the groceries. Thank you. No, you're good. Let me help. I already dragged you out here. I don't need you to help with the groceries. Are you gonna be okay in here with them? They're just your parents. Yeah. But they're crazy. Go help your brother. Okay. Thank you for doing this. I know you don't... I know you don't really want to be... Maybe it'll work. Honey, look, it's snowing. What are you doing? Uh, nothing. I feel better already. Ha-ha. I do. This is the best I have felt in a very long time. What else could a guy want? It was here during one spring vacation that a young family came to enjoy some rest and relaxation. And gain a bit of hope. But what they found was the opposite. Ending with four gruesome murders, and a still missing teenage girl. All at the hands of one Casey Pollack, who would soon become known in the press as... the ”Axe Mom. ” Casey Pollack worked the night shift as a nurse, coming home most mornings just in time to make her children their lunches and see her husband off to work as a local high school physical education teacher. But her family is in terrible danger. Casey Pollack, the loving wife and mother, is an illusion, hiding a terrible monster inside. Detective Dean Walker, a 14 year veteran of the Mt. Ryerson Police Department remains lead detective on the Pollack case. Detective Walker, Casey Pollack's crimes were, by any standard, heinous. Was this something you believe she thought of beforehand? What she did was incomprehensible. And the amount of planning that went into it, she knew exactly what she was doing. The way she performed the killings, the sheer number of executions she performed in such a short period of time, with zero remorse, none. She made no attempt to hide what she had done. It was here, at Shand Healing Estates a service specializing in spiritual retreats that Casey began planning her family getaway. Mmm. Sorry about the smell in here. It doesn't smell. It doesn't smell gross in here? It's probably just wet. Yeah, the fucking drawer's stuck. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Do you think that's the cabin that we're in? Yeah, looks like it. Dad? Jason? Mr. Pollack? Ladies, let's go find their ax. Get those boots on, pronto. Pronto? Yeah, pronto. You, too, blonde girl. Becky, Dad. Her name's Becky. Becky. Of course. It's the cancer. Let's go. Just go get the bags first, okay? All right. The ladies are in this room with the two beds. You and I are in here. Wait, wait. We're sharing a room? Ah, shit. Not cool. The service up here sucks. I told my grandma I'd let her know I got here safe. Uh, there's a landline. Go ahead and use that. It's dead. Shit. Batteries. Is there another one? James, is there a phone in the bedroom? I didn't see one. Sorry, honey. Is Lily gonna worry? I had texted her from the car that we're almost here. It's okay, Mrs. Pollack. Okay. You girls wanna help me cook dinner? No luck on the ax. I'm gonna check the flu. Then we'll look for wood in the woods. Ready to go? Jason? Jason! What? No, sorry, I can't right now. Last chance. I'll, uh, I'll help you get it lit. That's not the hard part. James! What? Sorry. Don't look, kids. Where are you going? Getting the wood. Be careful out there. Wolves love me. I'm a wolf person! Dad? He's probably out in the woods somewhere. I'm not going out there. What if he needs help carrying the wood? Hmm, he probably doesn't. Mom? She's cooking. Make sure she can't see anything. Uh, no thanks. I'm so glad that you could come with us this trip. This would've been worse than the year we went to Hoover Dam. You know, with my uncle's RV. Yeah. Oh, my God. My grandma was having a book club meeting this weekend, so, glad I could get out of the house. God, those old ladies make the living room smell like... like weird meat and mint. That's like weirdly specific. No, it's gross, though. It's like a meat cream. Yeah, that sounds gross. How is she, by the way? She's okay. She got sick last week. I know. You said. She's okay, though, right? Yeah. You know. Lily's Lily. Well, she's not that bad. Oh, come on. She's not like my parents. They watch me every fucking second. What causes this woman to act in this manner? Her, her killings surely were ritualistic, but I believe her motive was greed. Pure and simple. It's the oldest motive in the world. Now, things did get out of hand and she lost control, but greed was the original motivator. And it was a direct result of her husband's diagnosis. James recently updated his will to include his children. For Detective Walker and the rest of the officers on the Pollack case, the changing of James's will seemed like an airtight motive. But some didn't believe Casey's motivation was quite so simple. Up next, we sit down with one of the only people who's heard Casey Pollack speak since the traumatizing events. Right here on Inside Crime. I'm not ashamed to admit I have values. But you don't have to preach the gospel to realize that something's wrong in this country. When the dream of a better life is out of reach for some while others continue to use the system for their own selfish ends. As Governor, I'll end the war on values. And I'll fight against attacks on our quest for a better world. Belief makes us strong. It is belief that will deliver us to a better tomorrow. I'm Leslie Bison and I approve this message. Yeah right. Try it. Okay, what do I do? Just inhale. Oh, I don't want it. You all right? I'm fine. JESSICA: It takes some getting used to. God, my grandma's gonna kill me. She might kill you. She could kill you. I just don't want her to worry. She's old. Oh, come on. What are you talking about? You're like the best good girl I know. She has nothing to worry about. Yeah, well, sometimes it seems like I'm more capable of taking care of her than she is. Like, the other day, I came downstairs and she was just watching the TV. Not blinking. Her mouth was wide open. I had to call her name three times before she realized I was even there. She started acting normal again. Not that weird. My grandma used to do the same thing. Yeah, but, the TV was off. I'm sorry. It's okay. You know, what can you do? Shit. Are you just gonna leave it? Yeah. It was from the disgusting, dirty smokers who were here before us. Ah, I like the way you think. Let's go. Dump in the pasta. What's taking him so long? He'll be fine. Give it a stir. What are you looking for? Ghosts? What? What do you mean? Nothing. Really. It's just that... I've just heard things about these woods. And the spirits that live here. Stop it. What? You're scaring us. Oh, I'm not scared. I'm just saying it's not unheard of to... see things out there in the dark night. Mom! Sorry. You're too easy. Hey, everything all right? Yes. How's your timing? Did you pick the trees yet? I have the spots. Pulling up shortly. We need to make sure it happens the way it's supposed to. We have to complete the cycle. I just think... Don't think. Snow's starting to come down. It's gonna be heavy out there tonight so be careful. I'll be just fine. Jason! Oh, my God! Casey, help! What do you want me to do? Just do it. Who is this? Jesus, Casey. Okay, pull her head back. Is she dead? I just found her. One-thousand two, one-thousand three, one-thousand four. One-thousand two, one-thousand three, one-thousand four. Oh, fuck! Okay. Come on. What happened? She was literally lying face down in the snow when I found her. Whoa! Are you okay? Mm-hmm. What's your name? Leslie Bison. Okay. Leslie, what were you doing in the woods? I was looking for some help. Leslie, we're gonna get you to a hospital now, okay? No, that's all right. I think I'm all right. I just need to get warm. Anyone hungry? Nope! I am. Let me just wash my face. Leslie, why don't you take a seat? Get the car started. You want me to go? Not all the way. Just until you get a signal to call an ambulance. Can you help me out? Thanks, beautiful. Well, thanks for grabbing me. Leslie, I'm gonna go down and get you some help. Sure. I'll be back. You good? Yes, go. 911. What's your emergency? Hi, I'd like to report an injured woman. We know that before she committed the murder, she traveled back down the hill alone to alert the paramedics about what she was about to do. She wanted to get caught in that moment. Something in that twisted brain of hers didn't want to go through with it. And I wish she had gotten help right then and there. There's been some inconsistency and confusion in the case, especially in regards to this mysterious injured woman. We now know there was no injured woman. The police reports time it out so that the call occurred before she even murdered Mika. That wasn't the only call Casey Pollack made before the murders. She also placed a call to Becky's grandmother, Lily Lane. The call was very short. She just wanted to let me know that my granddaughter had arrived safely. And then she told me they'd found an injured woman. Before I could ask any questions, she claimed to lose reception as she drove up the hill to the cabin. I haven't heard from her since. Most people only live here in the summer months. Martha and Carl Hastings are year-round residents in Mt. Ryerson. They're the only eyewitnesses we have from that night. I heard some screaming. Woke me up. Then I heard Carl calling me from the kitchen. I, uh, I looked down from the kitchen door towards the pier. And that's when I saw the two ladies in a struggle. That's when Martha called the police. Dr. Ramsey. Is there such a thing as pure evil? I don't believe that exactly. But I definitely saw something in Casey that... I can't explain. The events are terribly tragic. Too many people lost their lives to a very sick woman. But the fact remains that there's still a missing girl out there. And there's a family who... ...does not have one ounce of closure. And that's terribly frustrating as lead detective on this case. So, tell me a little bit about yourselves. Are you three in school? What grade are you in? Uh, graduated. But these two are juniors. Wow. Congratulations on the graduation. Hello? Hi, Lily, it's Casey. Oh, hi, Casey. I'm just calling to let you know that we made it to the cabin safely. You guys having fun? Yeah. We found an injured woman in the woods. Oh, that's terrible. She's gonna be okay. I called an ambulance. Oh, Becky's a tough cookie. I'm sure she'll be helpful to you. Becky is a tough cookie, yes. Yes, I will. Oh... I'm losing you. I'll call you in the morning, okay? Don't we usually say grace before we eat? Not usually. Uh, yeah we do. I think it's rude. Okay. I'm sorry. We can say grace if that's what you all like to do. Take my brother's hand. Oh Lord, we thank you for your many gifts. And for this bounty we are about to receive. Please bless our family and our new friends joining us in this meal. And bless our friends and family everywhere. Amen. Amen. Paramedics are on their way. Paramedics? Yeah, we need to make sure you're okay. Good idea. Is there anything left for me? Yep. This is Mika Shan's cabin, right? Yeah. How do you know Mika? She rents this place out to people who are dying. I'm sorry. Are you a renter? I'm confused. Which one of you is, uh, sick? Leslie. You're not being very cool right now. Sorry? Where did you say you were renting again? I didn't. I'm not a renter. That's not how I know Mika. Then how do you know... Why were you in the woods? Why are you interrogating me? Why don't we wait outside for the ambulance? I was in the woods, on my way here. Next thing I know, I'm on your front lawn. With your tongue in my mouth. Excuse me? I'm kidding! Kids, go in the other room. No, I'm not leaving you in here with her. Do you mind if I... All right, look, I apologize. I thought I was being funny. But it wasn't funny. You saved my life. I'm sorry. I'm... It's all right. Hmm. Feels good to eat. What are you saying? She's just complimenting the food. It's good. Is it? Yeah. I'm two seconds away from tying that lady to a chair. Leslie, could you sit back down, please? Leslie. Okay, grab your things. Let's wait on the porch. Fine. No! Jessica, Jessica! Nicely done. Shh. Jessica! Jason? Jess! Go! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on! Go! Go, go! Mom? Chill, chill, chill. Okay, come on. Okay. You're okay. Shh. Shh. Okay. It's okay. Listen. If I leave for a second, to see what's happening, will you be okay? Hey! Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay, it's okay. Hey! Hey, hey, over here! What are you doing to us? It's my turn, dear. Feel that? That's power, Casey. Help, help! Shh. Shh. Okay, come on. Shh. They're above us. We should run while they're inside. Don't leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. I think it's clear. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, send help! Help! Hi, Casey. Mika! What are you doing here? I just came to check on you. See how the house is working out. At 11:30? Casey, I don't... Calm down. Tell me... Ah, Casey! Casey! What the fuck is going on? Awesome. Look who's awake. Mornin', hon. We're almost done here. How do I stop it? How do I change them back? At this point, there's nothing you can do. No, there has to be a way to reverse it. Hello? Hey, girl. Getting close? Uh, yeah. I'm almost there. About to lose service, though. Well, look. It went great. The ladies send their best. I'll tell you all about it. Did they clear the road yet? They're about halfway through. Good. Get up here quick. Leslie. Oh, my. I underestimated you. I have your girl. You sure she doesn't have you? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Well, don't do anything stupid. I haven't touched the boy yet. Talk to your mother. Mom, don't listen to her! He's passionate. Can we make an exchange? Good idea! You bring Mika up here and I'll give you your son. Great. See you in a few. Thanks. This is smart. Who are the ladies? Who are the ladies? The ladies? Who are the ladies? No! No. They have a, a home. About a mile or so into the woods. Walk. I'm hurt. Okay, okay, fine. Stop! Go, get up. I need to warn you, though. There's no way for me to know what they'll do. If they want you there, they'll let you in. But if they don't... Can they help? If there's a way, they'll know how. Uh, I'll stay here. Give me your foot. Casey. Casey, wait! Please! Casey. Casey. Casey! Casey! Hey, Paul, up to the summit yet? Can you confirm multiple trees? Copy? I got past the first two. But I might need some help with this third one. Looks like weather. It's coming down pretty hard up here. Standby. Sending backup. Copy that. Casey. Hi, Casey. Why don't you put that thing down? Lily? I'm... Who are you? I'm just a very old woman who's been waiting a very long time. How's Becky? Oh, she's sure grown. She's gonna blossom into a brand new person. Come on. It's so warm. What's happening? It's the rock. It warms us. It guides us. Come this way, child. The fact remains that there's still a missing girl out there. How do you explain something like that? To answer this question, one must look at the passions that inform the murderous mind. But to truly understand the mind of a predator we must examine her prey. Mika Shah, a rental agent and spiritual healer, who Casey coaxed to their cabin then bound to a tree and disfigured. Oh, Casey. If things had been different, you could've joined us. You certainly have the stomach for it. The stomach for what? What's coming next. Becky's grandmother, Lily Lane. The call was very short. She just wanted to let me know that my granddaughter had arrived safely. Who are you? We've always been around. Right from the beginning. Some people call us witches. But I like to think of us as a collection of old gals who just care, Although this tragedy occurred during spring break, the chill of winter continued through March that year. The Pollack family set out for a nice few days in the mountains, only to have their plans erupt into madness and murder on their very first night in the cabin. What am I watching? The future. Listen. We've seen countless generations destroyed by chaos. Destroyed by their own nature. And when we can, we like to move the big picture forward. Like to find people who can do it for us. Belief makes us strong. Like her? It is belief that will deliver us to a better tomorrow. Well, she's the horse we're betting on. You know, we used to be able to look into a glass or flames. Searching for a glimpse of what was going to come next. But now, we can pick up the signal direct. It's all inevitable. Can you help me? How do I save my family? You're not the only one who's made a sacrifice. I gave them Becky. I'm not gonna pretend I didn't know what was going on. This was the cabin where a mother gruesomely burned the bodies of her husband and two children. Shh, shh. Stop it. You've got to go and collect the stone fragments. To do this, you must sever their heads, then burn them. It's the only way to set them free. The paths that define us have already been chosen. Go! The ritual's almost complete. Fucking bitch. I just want the fragments. You saw the ladies. And they kept you alive? Well, it's no matter. Your family's mine. Help me bring the boy to cycle. Hey, Martha. Did you hear that? What is going on out there? Oh! Oh, Carl, I have to call the police. Oh, my God. Yes, a woman and a girl. Please hurry. Holy shit. Walker. Come again? Yeah, I'm on my way. Jason! Oh, my God. You're okay. We have to get out of here. You should be nicer to me. Oh, yeah. Ha-ha-ha. I'm gonna kill you for this. No, you're not, dear. I'll leave you devils to it. Ma'am, put down the ax. Put down the ax and get down on the ground now! For Casey Pollack, the truth of that gruesome night is locked away with her. Unknowable to police and psychiatrists alike. Perhaps in time, she will be able to share what really happened on March 21st, 2015. But more importantly, what became of Becky Lane? Some stories will always remain a mystery. And the case of the Axe Mom could be one of those. While we can examine the facts, we may never really know the truth. From everyone here at Inside Crime. Thank you for watching. I'm Jack Sterling, and I'll see you next week. Please let me go! I won't say anything. Oh, my God. What's happening? You're part of a bigger picture, dear. It'll all be over soon, I promise. Please, help me. Here we go. Please, no. Coming up on the news at 11, dark horse Leslie Bison beats Perry Lifton in a landslide victory.
