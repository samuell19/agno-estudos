This is the story of three friends at the bottom of the school hierarchy. Unexpectedly sharing their fate with the toughest dyke in school. It all started when Peggy got an idea. Of course! I know what we should do! - Start... - A... Band! A band! Really? You're gonna start a little baby band? It's gonna be a cool band, 'cos I'm gonna be in it! Everybody was afraid of Riff, even the bullies. Born to be a rock star, Riff needed a backup band that was easy to boss around. They started raising money, bought some crappy instruments, and finally Dyke Hard was born. And before they knew it, they got their first gig. It was just at the local youth club. But the right people, showed up. Texas was an agent for a major record label. And Dyke Hard got signed! After that, things happened pretty fast. They recorded a single and snuck it into all the cool parties. Soon people couldn't get enough. "Payback" was a big hit! And almost overnight Dyke Hard were stars! Everybody listened to "Payback". And wherever they went, they were chased by devoted fans. ♪ Payback! ♪ My time and my love And my hope ♪ ♪ And my songs And my faith, my emotions ♪ Then came the fights. They had a hard time coming up with new material. Sales went down... ♪ Payback! ...and Dyke Hard dropped from the charts. They hit the rock bottom of rock. And that's the last that was ever heard of them. ♪ Payback! Until now... Thank you, thank you. Here's a little song I wrote the other night... while I watched your mothers get undressed. Boo! Yeah! ♪ I have written my own song - Shut up! ♪ Everybody, come on Sing along ♪ - You suck! - Boo! Who the hell threw that? Well, fuck you, too! Come on! I'm too big for this place anyway! Hmh. Rough night, huh? Yeah, tell me about it. Oh, here's something to cheer you up. Thanks, Buck. You're a real doll. Don't worry, it's on the house. If you think you had it bad, I've slept with every man in this bar. I mean look at them! Thor's such a bore, Gary, he's too hairy and Amid is just a kid. I'm tired of meeting men in bars. I'd like to meet men behind bars. And now what you've all have been waiting for. Our very own Buck Blossom! Huh? Oh, that's me! He's a real veterinarian and specializes in bears! I guess that's my cue. Gotta run, dolls. See ya later! ♪ Gimme good times, baby! He also makes house calls. Here! He's got a PhD in Big and Hairy. Come on! Come to Daddy! You've got a problem, he's got the cure! For sure! But no bare back, only bear back! Hey! Oh, hey! Oh! I think you guys were great! I've loved "Payback" since the first time I heard it. Thank you! I mean, "Payback", I mean, I guess it's our only hit single. But if we don't come up with something new that's good, 'cos otherwise we'll be has-beens. You already are! Maybe you should start your second song with only drums. Who asked your opinion anyway? You're not even in the band! Hey, I'm just trying to help! I'm a big fan of yours! Scram! Stay! What? "Pay the parking fee before Wednesday or else!" Wednesday! That's tomorrow! Damn! Let's go see Texas. Yeah, come on! Being our manager and all, Texas has to help us. Hey, Texas! Did we get any money from our last gig? Are you kidding? You're a bunch of good-for-nothing losers! And I've been wasting my time on you! I've got bigger fish to fry! Breakaway pop hits, reality TV stars... You know, real talent! So get out of my face before I throw you out! It's over! Oh, it's such a shitty business. You have no idea! Hey, I'm back! I got pizza! Tex is right. You guys are a bunch of losers. Peggy, I'm so sick and tired of your whining. And Bandito, you're not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. And Scotty, you're such a nutty nerd. I can't believe I've stayed with you guys for so long. I'm going solo! Wait! Wait a minute, Riff, we can change! Riff! Without Riff we're doomed. How can someone just leave like that? I'm glad Riff quit. Can't you see we've been oppressed? What? - Come on! Now we can finally play the music we like without getting beaten up. With no one to scare away our fans, we might even get laid! I guess you're right. It is awful how Riff treated that Lola. But we're going to be nice to each other and to everybody. - I'm beat. Let's go to bed. - Yeah. Scotty! Oh, pathetic... Note to self: Do not repeat utilization of this vehicle for energy recovery. We must get our caravan unbarred before tonight! Good morning! Hey! What happened to our mobile home? Ah, Dios mío! My dresses! Spontaneous combustion! I never thought I'd witness it in my lifetime! My Snaggletooth! Without my action figures my retirement funds are... insufficient! But the note said Wednesday! Well, I thought that meant tonight. Well, I guess today is also technically Wednesday. But I don't think the landlord could've done this. We must report this to the authorities. They will investigate the matter professionally. Yeah, we should call the cops, but can we have breakfast first? Cos I'm starving! Come on, guys! No, don't eat me! I'm just a little bun! - I will call the police now. - OK. What's the matter? Don't you like buns? Hey, what's this? TV is having a battle of the bands! The winner gets a contract with Wolf Records! Let me see! Let me see! And 10,000 dollars! Come on! Better hurry, it's only three days away! Can we please use your phone? Get back! What the heck? I'd like to make an application. It's Dyke Hard. Dyke Hard! - Woo-hoo! - Yeah! It begins. ♪ Our love sets me free Oh my God! We're gonna be on TV! But what are we gonna wear? Do I look OK? Bandito, kindly focus your attention on the road ahead, please! What did you say? Jesus Christ! - Shit! Can you hear me? Dawn was a Thai boxer on the way to a martial arts tournament that was being held the same day as The Battle of the Bands in the big city. Luckily Dawn wasn't too badly hurt by the accident, but was offered a seat in the car for compensation. So you're going to the big city, too. We'll give you a ride! Please, don't sue us! You wouldn't get anything. We're broke. And then we used to dress up and play pirates on the porch! That was my favorite game until I was like 13. I like games, too. When I was little, my master used to shoot arrows at me with a bow. OK. Huh? Prison guard? Yeah! Wow! I want that job. Yeah! Get back to the 80's, you freak! Fuck! Huh? Need a ride? - Wow! Yeah! Where to? Any place but this dump. - I think I can manage that. - Cool! - Get in! - All right! I've got a terribly long road ahead of me. Perhaps hearing your story will make it shorter. What's eating you? It's my band. I broke up with them. 'Cos they're a bunch of losers. And now I'm all alone. Oh, that must feel terrible. No, I'm better off without that dead weight. But there's a big battle of the bands in the big city on Saturday, and I can't be in it. Why? Because of some stupid contract with our record label. That sucks! 'Cos I know, without those morons I could be going places. Well, despite having just met you, I'd be delighted to help. Help me? Why? You don't even know me. And besides, why would anyone help anyone? You see, I'm an entrepreneur. I started with two empty hands, and now... Wow! Voilà! - Wow! - You see, you remind me of myself. Many years ago I was young, misunderstood... The whole world was against me. But then when things couldn't get any worse, a stranger appeared came out of nowhere and gave me a fresh start. I never got to thank that stranger. So I'd like to repay the favor to you. Wow, that's awfully generous of you, Miss... Moira. Just call me Moira. Now come on inside. I'll show you what I can do for you. Great. I never got any help from anyone. And neither will you, my "friend". Wow. - Knock knock! - Who's there? - Boo! - Boo who? Don't cry, I'll take the job. Very funny. So, big boy, you like to play games? Uh-uh. But can you handle a few bad men? Let's see if they can handle me. You see, I'm pretty bad myself. Hmh... See what I mean? Mm. Well, all right! - When can you start? - Right away, Master! Show me your ass. - My ass? - Yeah. All right, I'll show you my ass. Now you're mine! I can make you a star. I don't doubt it. You have way better taste than my previous manager, Texas. But how are we gonna get rid of Dyke Hard before Saturday? By "get rid of", what exactly do you mean? I mean murder! Kill! Assassinate. Exterminate. Mm. - With Dyke Hard out of the way, I would be able to show my own true solo talent at The Battle of the Bands! You are driven, aren't you? And I appreciate that tenacity and rugged determinism. But we must make sure none of this can be traced back to you. You see, murder would be a terrible blight on your career. But with a clean past you could go from rock star to movie star, to business tycoon, governor or even president! Oh... Yeah, I knew that. If we only had a plan. Yes. What? Invisible door! Awesome! Fill 'er up! - And now for snacks! - Yeah! I will locate and utilize the restroom facilities. Are you coming, Dawn? - I'll stay here and contemplate. What's Dawn contemplating? I've perceived no indication of any particular subject. - No, no. - No? As a footnote, however, I've read that when performing oral sex one should write the alphabet with one's tongue... until climax is achieved. Usually around the letter K. Hm, how? Welcome! - How may I help you? - Do you sell tacos here? - Certainly, Miss. - And what about clams? I'm afraid not, but there's a fish market a few miles up the road. And do you have any... rugs? "Insert hand". ♪ La, la, la, lesbian ♪ Lesbian girl ♪ You make me feel So transsexual ♪ Mhm... Maybe you could give me a call someday and we could talk some more about your... work. - Thank you, come again! - I think I will... come again. ♪ You make me feel So transsexual ♪ ♪ You make me feel So ladylike ♪ ♪ You turn me into a dyke Wow! What's all this? Well, it's a precaution really. To keep track of jealous people's pathetic attempts to stand in my way. It's like playing detective. It's like... a hobby of mine. But come over here, take a look at this! The target Dyke Hard located. Wow! Can you monitor anyone with these? - Sure. - Aha! Cool... So you've got like a whole private army with roller skaters, wrestlers, ninjas... Well, yes, I do have all those things... but I've found that the cleanest, most reliable way to get things done is to do them... yourself. - You mean you're gonna do it? - No, I mean you're gonna do it. That way no one can turn on you in court or sell you out to the press. In fact, I think your boundless enthusiasm will make sure that we have a perfect execution. Uh-huh. Ta da! Great plan! Oh, sorry. My God! Would you look at Dawn's action movie routine! Those toned arms, that muscular back, defined six pack... determined chin. What a poser! Wow! I never realized that Dawn was that hot! Yeah! There! They won't know what hit 'em! Bam! Just like that! In the middle of nowhere. Hum... I hope this car's equipped with a spare tire suitable for the season. Look! I'll go ask for help. Maybe they can lend us a spare tire. That house looks like a total ghost house. I wouldn't set my foot in it for a million dollars. Dawn has been absent for about 8 minutes and 43 seconds. I see it as my duty to check out the status of the expedition. Scotty! Wait! Can I come with you? - Scotty! - Bandito! We're staying here! Bandito! Hello? Anybody... home? Dawn? Dawn? Ah! Look! Footsteps! This way! What's going on here? Dawn! Thank God you're all right! I see you are well! We just witnessed an intriguing phenomenon. You're just imagining things! No! They were right here! I've checked all the floors. There's nothing to be afraid of. This place has been abandoned for a long time. Maybe we should spend a night here. Over my dead body! Come on, Pegs, you know we can't afford a motel room! We'll need... fire wood, blankets, tools... And a spare tire would be great. Let's split up and see what we can find. OK? Scotty, we need to find blankets and wood now! You can play the piano later. Come to me! Come to me! Come to me! Hi.

Look, we've all been through a lot today and we have no money. If this person is nice, maybe we can sleep in the barn tonight.

This Moira sounds like an awful, jealous, evil person. Why help someone like that? Well, Moira is also the saddest person I ever met. Always surrounded by people, yet hopelessly alone. But now your friend Lola is here like sent from heaven. You must go with Lola. Corrupt or not, I still don't ever want to leave you, Granny. I'll always be here for you. Now go. Goodbye, Scotty. And Peggy. My thoughts will be with you. Take care of them, Dawn. Woo-hoo! Ah! Et tu, Granny! Where is your loyalty? I thought we were like, not friends, but something. I see it now. My plans, they were too simple, too small. I've gotta think bigger! If I can't kill them... and I can't pacify them... I'll humiliate them in front of the whole world.

I would like to check in Dyke Hard. Dyke Hard! Hum.... Um... Sorry, hot stuff, but there's no such name in my papers. Then I'll file an application for Dyke Hard right now. That's a cool name! Mhm... The intake is actually closed, but-- - I'm gonna get you fired. - Yeah, yeah. But if you promise not to tell anyone... - Ow... - I'll sneak you in! Yeah! Am I OK? OK! There's been a riot, and it's double booked, for some reason. Nobody knows. No comment. No comment. I'm afraid there's been an unfortunate misunderstanding, this venue has been double booked both for TV's Battle of the Bands and The Martial Arts Tournament. The organizers are trying to work out a solution as we speak. - What the hell! - No! No. Excuse me! I got something to say. What? Who's that? I am a Thai boxer, but I've opened my heart to music. I represent a dojo of fighters who up until a few days ago had never heard of a round kick or an upper cut. They were musicians, and I taught them how to fight. I'm a fighter. But they taught me how to sing. Yeah. These last few days have been the most important days of my life. I've learned about acceptance, friendship, betrayal and forgiveness. And I've found love. Tonight, right here, I believe fate brought us all together to learn from each other and to open our minds. And if we can find it in our hearts to share this space together, we will witness something entirely new that will change our lives forever. Yeah! Please. The organizers have decided to work together. I hereby declare the first martial arts and music festival officially open! Yeah! Are you happy? - Yeah! - Yeah! Well, well, well! Hello, hello, everybody! Welcome to the world's first rock and sports festival. ♪ Dance the night We're here as sports commentators. Breaking, it's called. You learn something new every day. Hot damn! Now that's what I call karate! And now for tonight, the most expensive act. It is Riff Painful and the Poodle Rockers! There's a rumor that a mysterious billionaire is behind Riff's solo career. The Big M's landed. Yay! Hello morons! What a fucking lame answer! - "Are you ready to rock?" You better be. Riff is barking orders at these kids, but will they buy it? ♪ Survival of the fittest ♪ I eat Superman for breakfast ♪ I crush the weak Under my heel ♪ ♪ I show no mercy I'm made of steel ♪ ♪ God ask permission ♪ The devil keep on wishin' ♪ Zie could be as mighty as me ♪ I'm your Number One ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ I'm the best one around ♪ Yeah, yeah I'm your Number One ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ I'm the queen of this town ♪ The queen of this town...

Ah! ♪ I'm the ayatollah ♪ Of rock and rollah! ♪ There's no competition In this world ♪ ♪ My music makes Your pubic hair curl ♪ ♪ No one can beat me OK, guys, it's time to get on stage. Are you ready? Yeah! - Excuse me. You're Dawn, right? - Yes. You're here to defend your belt against Killer Queen? Yeah, but I'm also here to play with my band, Dyke Hard. Oh, I'm sorry, but there's only one act per person. You've kinda got to choose. Then I play with my band. I've done enough fighting today. Yes! ♪ I'm your Number One Ah! I spent a fortune on this show and now they don't even like it! They can't be allowed to go on stage and win. Yeah. Send in the ninjas. Peggy! What are you waiting for? Your speech was really great. You're truly a born leader. I just spoke my mind. Round One! - Fight! - Scotty! We've got company! Oh no! Ninjas! - Ninja challenge! - To the death! These guys must watch a lot of movies. Let's give 'em a live show! Take that! Thai boxing... "Windmill" Johansson! Damn it! Well, if they want to play it that way! And the winner is... Send in the roller derby. - Win! - Recognize! Wait! A ninja conspiracy. But for what purpose? Peggy! Bandito! Cannonball wrestling Blue Demon! Peggy! Look out! Win! Da-da-da-da-Dawn! Must I do everything myself. ♪ We belong ♪ Together in this... OK, this is it, Dykes. Are you ready? Let's get it on! Dawn! Go, Pegs! Hello, Peggy! Long time no see! Who are you? Hey, knock it off! This is none of your business. Stay out of it! I've met you before somewhere. Wow! ♪ Sitting in the corner Feeling blue ♪ Moira! Moira! It is you! Oh, you suddenly remember my name now! How flattering! You're the one who paid Granny to keep us out of here! Why did you do that? We used to be band mates! We used to be amigas! Amigas? You mean friends? You didn't even notice me! None of you did. You all forgot me. Completely and totally. As if I didn't exist, as if I hadn't been there from the very beginning. - Start... - A... Band! Moira! But we're not like that anymore. - We're really sorry. - You are? Peggy! Can't we end this without bloodshed? How do you make up for a ruined self-esteem? Even cognitive behavioral therapy couldn't fix it! I know Riff was the real bully, but you all had friendship. And you wouldn't even share it! You're right. We were blind and selfish. But we were abused, too. Riff constantly tried to break us down with her bossy ways. But along the way we got caught up in a lie. A Lie of acceptance and hell, maybe even a promise of fame. And we... left you behind. I think we all learned our lesson. We're sorry. Can't you come back to the band? How do I know you won't just treat me like shit again? We promise! You put us through a lot and rightfully so. You've gotten your revenge. Now it's time for you to heal. I think the best way is by letting us show you the love and respect that you always deserved. Oh, Moira! And the last act tonight is... Dyke Hard! Hey! That song, "Payback". It was you who wrote it, wasn't it? I did. That song was a warning. It was a cry for help. We get it... now. But... won't you... well... with us? Yeah. Mmhm. But what do I play? Here! That's about as much as you can use a guitar within the limits of law. Thanks. All set? - Don't embarrass yourself. Wow, looks like Riff didn't get enough of that microphone last time round. You don't want to listen to this shit, these losers. Get off the stage! We all know I'm the winner, so why don't we just... I'll be damned! It's starting to resemble rock'n'roll! I'm from the future. I will destroy you! Come on! Ah! My cyborg plan! I forgot all about that. Sorry! Now you will feel real pain! Now you die! - Take shelter! You die! Again! Again! I love you! I love you, too! Come to me! Holy shit! They like fused! It's okay now! I love you! Love yourselves! What a touching paradox! - Can we play now? - Yeah! Yeah! Come on, Moira! Well, after a quite convincing futuristic stage show the band is now ready to play.
