You need to stop calling me! I mean it! No! No, you need to leave me alone. I don't know how to make it any more clear for you. It's over. Hello? Hello? Is someone there? Mom! Your phone! Yeah, I hear it. I just can't find it. Ice cream break. Becca, did you take the last of the... The last of the what? Never mind. We're out of ice cream. You don't say. Did you check out the living room? I saw it. What do you think? Looks like a living room. Well, how's your bedroom coming along? It's bigger than your old one, isn't it? It's just a room, Mom. I thought you liked this place. You said you approved. I like the pool. Could use a cleaning. Yeah, I haven't gotten around to that yet. Hey, if you wanna pitch in and start skimming? I'd be up for a swim. Why don't you just hire someone? I mean, you're rich now from the divorce, right? That's not fair, Becca, and that's not even true. Who told you that? - Forget it. - Your father? Forget it. I want to hear what you have to say. You're part of this family. I don't want to take sides. Well, you know what he did. I know what you've done. Worked. That's all I ever do. Well, according to dad, that was the problem. And that gives him the right to sleep around with women half his age? No, I didn't... I didn't say that. Look, I hate being put in the middle, mom. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm trying to make this work. You know? New house, new neighborhood, new memories. I get it, but I kind of liked what we had. Well, you could have stayed with your father. You're 18. I'm not gonna live with dad in the midst of his mid-life crisis. God, who is he dating now? No, don't tell me. I don't want to know. Rule No. 15, never talk to me about who your father is seeing, not until I've had at least a gallon of Mint Chocolate Delight in my system first. I can go get some, but I'd have to borrow your car. I would take mine, but I... You don't have one. I'm well aware. But you know what? Graduation is right around the corner. Maybe your fairy car mother will just appear right on time. Just make sure there's some in the container when you get back. No promises. Bye! Bye. Thank you. Scoop you later. One quart of Chocolate Mint and make it snappy, doll. Yeah, like you need it. I think body shaming is considered a crime now, especially in an ice cream parlor. Oh, this is my best friend. I'm gonna take five. Cover me. Thanks, Greggy! So how's the new digs? Weird. Look, just think about it this way. By fall, you'll be off at college with much better things to worry about... like boys. - Mm-hm. - That's what keeps me busy. Yeah? Who are you suddenly dating? Well, there's Mike, Hank... oh, and Charlie. - No, no! You're not! - I am! - In my mind. - Mm-hm. Well, don't start suddenly dating my dad. Ooh, Becca. Older guys are hot, but ancient guys are gross. Okay. No offense to your mom. Yeah. How are we friends again? Remind me? Easy. We both suffer from low self-esteem. Yeah. Can't catch a break. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. - I didn't know anybody. - You know you're trespassing! I do now. I'll get out of your way. Who are you? I'm Adam Lance. Nice to meet you. I clean a bunch of the pools in this area. Oh. I'm Gale Foley. My daughter and I just moved in last week. Well, that explains it. Explains what? Explains why I didn't know you were here. The realtor hired me to clean the pool, forgot to tell me that he sold the place. Yeah, I was the old owner's pool cleaner, Rhonda Phillips. Oh, that's the woman who died. It was a real tragedy. I guess she slipped getting into the tub, hit her head and drowned. Yeah. I didn't hear any of the details. I heard there was an accident five months ago. Well, you're here now. I guess I'm out of a job. I'm really sorry that I scared you. I really didn't mean to. I'll get out of your hair, Gale. Wait. You know, I was just talking with Becca, my daughter, about how we do need somebody to clean the pool. What are your rates? Well, that's awesome. First time's on the house. And I'll come back every week or so. And if you like my performance, $75, flat fee. Well, you can't beat that with a stick... or pole. Oh. That's funny. Okay, well, let's see what you can do. Awesome. Great. And Gale, I don't think you're gonna be disappointed. I clean up nice. Hey, I'm Adam. Um, Rebecca. Becca. My friends call me Becca. Your mom hired me to clean the pool, Becca. Way to go, mom. Oh, you know, I shouldn't be much longer. Sorry. Oh, don't rush on my account. That's fine. Your dripping. What? The ice cream... it's dripping? Oh! It's kind of warm out here. I should probably take it inside. Right. Nice to meet you, Becca. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Jackie? It's Becca. You've heard of Prince Charming, right? I just met Prince Gorgeous. I think I'm in love. Died in the tub, huh? Shower. - Hey! - Hey. I'm just headed out with Jackie to get some lunch. Well, I was hoping that we could spend some quality time together, you know, when I'm done with my campaign. Sure. Be back by midnight. Come on. It won't take me that long. I gotta go. Oh, fine. Have a great Sunday. Just leave your poor old mother here all alone. I'm not gonna feel guilty for you, Mom. You could have fun, too, if you wanted. - Bye! - Bye. Hey, Gale, how you doing this wonderful Sunday? I'm all right. Just, you know finishing up some work. Work? Today? You know what they say about all work and no play. Makes Jack Torrance go crazy. Huh? Never mind. Oh, I just left some of my buckets out back. I thought I'd come grab them. Be my guest. Thank you. Where are you from, Adam? I'm from all over, but I like here a lot. Nice people, lot of pools. Ever since my mom passed away, I've kind of been fending for myself. I'm really sorry to hear that. - It's okay. - Where's your father? Well, he left us when we were young, but you know, we're better off without him. I can relate to that. You are one popular lady. Yeah. Hey, Gale. What are you doing here, Tony? Just wanted to say hi. See how you guys are settling in. And was wondering why you hadn't signed the papers yet. We're good, the move was fine. And my lawyer charges by the hour, so he's taking his sweet time finalizing the approval. But, you know, if you're in a rush, you can go ahead and light a fire under... No rush. Just asking. I'm gonna take a drive down the coast. Alone? Not exactly. Hi. I'm Cindi. New car, huh? Yeah, I thought it was time for an upgrade. A new model. Maybe I'll let you take it for a spin sometime. I didn't know you had company. Good. You found the bucket. This is Adam, my pool boy. Pool man. I'm 25. Sorry. Man. Just an expression. This is Tony, my ex-husband, a man who acts like a boy. Hi. I'm Cindi. Well, we better get going if we wanna beat that coastal traffic. Take care of yourself, Gale. You too, Tony. Looks like you have your hands full yet again. I don't believe him. You know, he just showed up here to flaunt his new car and his new bimbo. Oh, look at me. Look how great my life is. Upgrade, my ass. You know what? He's trying to turn Becca against me? Trying to make me out to be the villain? But I'm not the one who cheated on him! Gale, I know it's not my place to say, but I think you're way better off without him. Just tell me. Why is it okay for a man to date a woman half his age, but somehow it's looked down upon for a woman to be with a younger man? I've never understood that. Honestly, I haven't. I blame the double standards from movies and television. You're right. You know, I wouldn't even know because my television, of course, isn't working. What's wrong with it? I don't know. I can't figure it out. Well, maybe I can. I'm pretty good with technology. Where is it? Upstairs. But look, I don't want to take up your whole day. No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine. I don't have another client for a couple of hours. Your room, right? - Yeah, my room. - Okay. You did it! So what was the problem? The inputs were reversed. The connection was all messed up. Story of my life. Yeah. Listen, Gale, I think you ought to forget about that loser. You need someone who makes you truly happy. Yeah, you're preaching to the choir. You're so stressed. You need to relax. Maybe I can help with that, too. Why, Mr. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Mr. Rob... what? You're really sweet, but this isn't gonna happen. Why not? Do you want reason number one or number 57? May I? One can always find a reason to not do something, Gale. A fear, a justification, a use of better judgment, but people tend to regret the things in life they don't do. What's the fun in that? Not living? Gale, aren't you entitled to a little fun, too? It has been a long time, but... Don't be afraid to live. I'm not afraid. Good. So you have to tell me everything. Start from his chest and work your way down. Well, he was wearing shorts, but he wasn't wearing a shirt. Mm. Muscles? And then some. Go on, and on and on and on. I'm afraid if I do, you'll explode! I don't care. I need visuals. What's his name? Adam. Please tell me you got a last name. I did. Adam Lance. Ooh, short for Lancelot? Did he have a lot of lance? Quite possibly. This is impossible. What? I can't find him anywhere. He has like no social media presence. No Adam Lance? Well, there must be a thousand. I know. There's nothing. Is this him? Not even close. Well, if he's as hot as you say he is, you better make your move fast, girl. My moves? Well, it's time Miss Becca learned some moves. Class is now in session! Phew. Oh, boy. What did I do? You did everything right. You're an amazing woman, Gale. And you are an impressive pool boy. And this was a nice one-time thing. What do you mean? You're really nice and really handsome. And, also, you're really, really young. But didn't you just give this whole speech about how it's okay for older women to date younger men? What happened to that? I don't want to stoop to Tony's level. I'm better than him. In every way. Which is why I can't do this again. Come on. Just, please, try to understand this. I have a daughter and you're young enough to be my son. - But I'm not your son. - Thank goodness for that. You want me to go. I think that would be best... Look, this was great. It really was, and you fixed my TV. You are quite the handyman. Handyman? I thought I was a pool boy. Come on. I'll show myself out. She used me. She used me. I can play those games, too. Yeah, I can play those game. Playing games, Gale. I know plenty of fun games. Thanks for the ride! Bye! Call me tonight. I will. Bye! Hey, I told you to call me tonight. The sun is still shining. Look out the window. I am. He's here! Who is there? Mr. Tall, Dark and Chiseled? Yep. He's outside. Doing what? Skinny-dipping. I'm kidding. He's cleaning the pool. What else? That was... That was cruel. All right. This is perfect for you then. Just do what we talked about. Be cool about it and make sure you look hot. Oh, hey. Hey. I didn't know you were here. Yeah, just getting your pool ready for action. And is it? It's open for business anytime you feel like getting wet. Your mother around? Um, no, she's still at work. Probably not gonna be around for hours. Hours? Hmm. Cool. Why? Is she supposed to pay you today? No, that's cool. She'll pay eventually. You need some help with that? Your back? Uh, sure. That'd be great. Thank you. You in high school, Becca? I'm a senior. I just turned 18. Wow. Happy belated birthday. Thanks. How about you? College boy? Nah. College is too theoretical. I'm into more hands-on stuff. You know what I mean? Yeah. All right, you're done. You're not! I am so sorry! It was Jackie's idea! Who's Jackie? She's my best friend. Well, I guess it's a good idea for a pool man to check out the pool before anybody else, huh? Yeah. How is it? See for yourself if you dare. Ow! Well, hello, Mrs. Foley. Mom, you're home early. Yeah. I just had work to do and thought I could accomplish more here. What are you doing here, Adam? Oh, I'm just showing some special attention to my two favorite clients. Why? Can I talk to you for a moment inside? Yeah, sure. No problem. What's up? I thought that I made it clear yesterday that what happened between us... Was a one-time thing? Yeah, I got it. You know, it was really special. But I think this should just stay between the two of us. I'm not gonna tell your daughter, if that's what you think. Good. So what are you doing here? I told you. I take care of your pool. Yeah. You're supposed to come once every week or once every other week. Some pools need a little extra attention. Not my pool. Well, it looks like it's Becca's pool, too. I think she's gonna be using it a little more than you. Adam, don't make me say this more than once. You stay away from my daughter. Why? I mean, things are obviously over between us. And I'm free to see whoever I want. Okay. She's only 18 years old. That's the legal age. Not in this household! It just doesn't seem fair. I'm too young for you, I'm too old for her. I mean, where do I lie here? You're starting to sound like my mom, you know that? That's actually kind of starting to turn me on. I think you should go. You're the boss. I gotta go. - Okay. - I got some stuff to do. Okay. What are you doing Saturday? I could make myself available. What'd you have in mind? I don't know. Lunch? Dinner? Up to you. Yeah, okay. Okay, what? Lunch. Lunch it is. Sounds like a date. Okay. Wow. You're looking nice today. Where you off to? Um, just getting together with Jackie. We're gonna do some studying. Studying? You? On a Saturday? Yeah. Final exams next week. In what? Fashion design? We're gonna study in the library. People are gonna see us there, then we'll look good. Look good for who? You know, there's no harm in taking pride in one's appearance, mother. Maybe you should try it sometime. And maybe you should start telling the truth for a change. I am telling you the truth. Maybe if you would have cared more how you look, Dad wouldn't have left. Do you really think that? It's Jackie. She's outside. We'll finish this conversation later. You're supposed to pick me up at the end of the block so my mom doesn't see us! I'm not afraid to be seen with you. And beauty should never be hidden. Anyways, your chariot awaits, my lady. Thank you. Let's go get some dessert. Yes. I know the perfect place to get it. It was dripping, I didn't want it to spill. Good thinking. How's the ice cream? Excuse me? What? Adam, this is Jackie. Jackie? Adam. Pool boy. You're the one who recommended her to push me in the pool, yeah? Right. Every boy looks good in a wet t-shirt. Uh, Jackie, I could use some extra napkins over here. You know where they are. - Be right back. - I can go grab them. No, that's all right. I'm gonna wash my hands. Be nice. Me? - No. Her. - Mm-hmm. So, Adam... How do you spell your last name? L-a-n-c-e. Why are you asking? Oh, I was just online and was trying to send you a friend request. But I couldn't find you anywhere. I tried Adam Lance, Adam Lancelot, King Adam. I'm not on social media. What are you? Like Amish? No. I'm just taking a break from the worldwide web. But what if you need to remember like special occasions and people's birthdays... I never forget. So what did we learn? Apparently, your boyfriend has the mind of an elephant. Huh? She means when people talk, I listen. A guy who listens. Can't beat that, right? Right. Well, it looks like Greg needs me back over there. So I'm going to go back to work. It was nice meeting you, Adam. Same. Don't do everything I would do. Call you later. Hey. How was the library? Uh, fine. Quiet. Stop lying to me, Rebecca. I saw you! I saw you getting in his truck! Okay. So I went on a date. Big deal. I'm 18 now, Mom. I'm old enough. He's older than you. Your stupid rules! What's seven years, hmm? At your age, a lot. Dad's seven years older than you. And you see how that worked out. I'm going to bed. Becca! Becca! I'm trying to hold this family together! All while juggling this big account at work. You know, if I can pull it off, it can mean a promotion, maybe even a partnership with the firm, which could be good for everybody! But I can't focus on work when I'm constantly worried about you every day... Then don't! Ever since you and dad split up, you've been treating me like this porcelain doll that's just about to break at any second! It's suffocating me! I can take care of myself. Oh, how I wish that were true. Okay, I'm gonna make this simple for you. I don't want you seeing him! Why? Jealous? Don't be absurd. What did he tell you? What did you two do? Everything. I just had the best night of my life. I'm not gonna let you ruin it for me. You're grounded! Do you hear me? Whoa, wait, she grounded you? Like used those words? Mm-hmm. What does she think you are? 12? Well, that's how she's been treating me. Is she home now? Nope. Had a meeting at her boss's house. Left an hour ago. On a Sunday? Guess so. She's been messing up everything recently, like here and at work. Somehow it's all Adam's fault. But she hired him. I know. I don't know what her problem is. I mean, Adam's a cool guy, right? Right? To be honest, he's a little weird, okay? Weird? Don't you mean awesome? Amazing? Perfect? Becca, you're not a guy like him and not online. That's like a huge red flag. My grandmother is even online. I'm not talking conspiracy theory, but you don't go off the grid without a reason. You're either running from something or hiding from someone. Something is off about Adam. I don't know. Exactly. You don't know. It's like you've been talking to my mother. Becca, look... Just be careful, okay? Yes, mother. Well, sorry you have to go so soon. Thanks for coming by. That was Adam? Yeah. He's coming over now. Becca, don't rush into anything. Think. We don't know jack about this guy. I know his name's not Jack. Do you? I mean, do you really? All we really know about him is that he can clean a pool and look good with or without a shirt. Get out of here, Jackie. Two's company, three's for losers. Way to treat your best friend. Way to be supportive! Whatever. Hey, you. Hey. Is your mom around? No, she's out, probably for a couple hours. - Want to go for a swim? - Yeah. - Oh, my God, do you... - Oh! Let's go! Hey, Scott. Yeah, I just got home. Tell Victoria I'm picking up the right thumb drive and I'll be there in a sec. Just stall her, okay? Just say whatever you have to say, I know you can come up with something. Yes, I'm in a hurry. It's me! I grabbed the wrong drive! Becca? You here? Becca? What the hell's going on out here? Nothing. I was just getting some sun and Adam came by to clean the pool. Yeah, just doing my job. Becca, go up to your room. Why? I wasn't... Room, now! I hate you. So, what's up? What do you think you're doing with my daughter? Showing her a good time. Time we could be having, should be having. Are you trying to date her to make me jealous or something? Well, is it working? It's over, Adam! - What's over? - All of it! You stay away from Becca. You stay away from me and you stay away from this house. You're fired! You got that? Loud and clear. Good. I want you out of our lives and never come back. You take care of yourself, Gale. What's that supposed to mean? Just don't let your emotions get the better of you. That's when accidents can happen. Victoria, hi. I was just heading out the door. Don't bother. We won't be needing you here today. But what about the presentation? I was up all night preparing. Just give everything to Scott. This meeting doesn't concern you. Victoria, I meant to come back yesterday. But I had a family emergency with my daughter. I sent you all the items and I got confirmation that they were received. They were, Gale, and I understand priorities. I tried calling you several times, but it went to voicemail. I like to see the people I'm talking with, Gale. Just relax today and we'll discuss your position with this firm tomorrow. You just take care of you. You say you found a rat in the filter pump? Yeah, I did. Was the cover off? No. Odd. I don't know how a rat could have crawled up in there unless it was a contortionist. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. When's the last time you had this pool cleaned? Just recently, actually. Well, whoever did it didn't do a great job. You know, I used to clean this one when it was owned by Mrs. Phillips, obviously, before she had that accident. I heard she died in the bathtub. Yeah. It does seem odd, too. She never hit me as the clumsy type. Of course, I was long gone by then. She had hired another guy, a kid, to clean this pool. Although some have speculated that he did more for her than just clean, if you get my drift. Really? If the rumors are true, I guess she liked the company of younger men. Hey, now! What, what is it? Anyone you know lose a tooth? Detective? Detective Davidson? Yes. You're in my spot. Sorry. I didn't want to miss you. Inside the station, they said you were the one in charge of the Rhonda Phillips case? I'm Gale Foley. I was just waiting for you to return. It was a little hectic inside of there. Oh, right, yeah, the Phillips woman hit her head, drowned. Coroner's report deemed it was an accidental death, that one? Yeah. Well, I moved into her house just recently. And I was wondering when you were examining her body, was she missing a tooth? I'd have to check the report. Why? Because I found this stuck in the drain at the bottom of the swimming pool today. In the pool? Yeah. So if they found her in a tub, how could her tooth end up in the pool? Okay, Mrs. Foley, I'll look into it. Thank you. Oh, will you also check an Adam Lance for me? He was the pool cleaner at the time of Miss Phillips's death. Mr. Lance, yeah. We interviewed him, but we didn't find anything connecting him to her death. Look harder, please. The guy scares me and he's been hanging around my house and my daughter. Okay. Well, if he doesn't leave you alone, you can take out a restraining order, okay? I just might do that. Thank you. Come on, Becca. Rebecca hasn't come home from school yet. And I've been trying to call her, but she's not picking up her cell phone. Do you know where she might be? I don't know. We're not really speaking to each other right now. Really? Why? What happened? We had a difference of opinion on something. Did it have to do with Adam? That guy she's seeing? You should really talk to Becca about that. I don't really feel comfortable talking... I think he might be dangerous, obsessive. You know, he gave me the creeps, too. Why'd you hire him? He just showed up at the house. He used to work for the woman who lived there before us. But didn't she die? Yeah. That's part of why I'm worried about Becca. Please, just try to talk to her. Just convince her to stay away from Adam. Okay, yeah, yeah. I'll do my best. Thank you, I'd really appreciate it. Come on, Becca, pick up. Come on, come on. Thank God! Becca, I just got done talking to your mom. And she's really worried and so am I. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but we think Adam is really unhinged. You know that woman that died in your house? We think he had something to do with it. Don't trust him, Becca, please, whatever you do, okay? Becca? Becca? Okay. - Hi. - Hey. You know, I love this place, but the only annoying thing is that the restroom's all the way back at the entrance. Oh, that's so annoying. This is one of my favorite spots. Yeah, mine too and being here with you. Oh, my God, if your mother could see us now. She'd kill me! Gosh, I can't imagine what she'd do to you. I can. Mothers can be very controlling. Tell me about it. But it all comes from love. Love is everything, even if it's meant to misdirect or to manipulate. Did someone do that to you? I don't know... even if she did. Doesn't make her a bad person. They're just trying to protect the ones they love. No matter what the consequences, it's instinctual. Sounds like she hurt you, whoever she was. I can handle it. I can hurt them right back if they get in my way. Because love conquers all, right? I could stay with you like this forever. Forever's a long time. Becca? Are you home? Becca? Becca, we need to talk. It's really important. Come on. I know you're not sleeping. This is childish. Okay, fine. We're gonna talk later. "Come around the back. Don't wake mom." Hmm. - Oh, my God! - Jackie! Jackie? I think my leg is broken! You fell in? Stay there. I'm gonna go call 911! - He pushed me! - Who? I didn't see who it was! She didn't say she fell. She said she was pushed and I suspect Adam Lance. No, I don't have any proof, but just see what you can do, please. I have to go. - Good morning, Gale. - Morning. Mind if I walk with you to your office? - Of course not. - Good. I just wanted to see if you enjoyed your day off. It was a bit hectic, to be honest. But, like I said, I'm not gonna let anything interfere with work again. That's good to hear. After all, work is work and personal matters should stay personal and at home. Yeah, I completely agree. Great. So maybe you can explain this? Oh, my God! And someone named Adam has called about a dozen times this morning. Scott left the messages on your desk, if you can still locate your desk under all this clutter. We have a strict rule here. Keep your personal life personal and out of this office. I'm so sorry. This guy, he's insane. He's unstable. I've already contacted the police. I'll call them again. I'll file a restraining order. I don't need this kind of trouble, Mrs. Foley. I have enough of my own. Fix this situation immediately or don't bother coming back to work. Yes, Victoria. Back to work! Oh, man, I can't believe you slept with him. Yeah, well, I can't believe some of the women you slept with either, honey. So what do you want me to do? Talk to him. I tried. I even contacted the police several times. But Detective Davidson says that declarations of love don't constitute a criminal offense. And since he hasn't come within 500 feet of me, a restraining order is out of the question. I thought maybe he would listen to you, you know, man-to-man? But he's just a kid. Yeah, who's dating our daughter. He's what? I think he's seeing her to get back at me, trying to make me jealous or something. He texts me all day long. He won't leave me alone. He's obsessed. He even says things like I remind him of his mother, his dead mother. Does Becca know about this? No. She won't talk to me. And if I tell her this, she's never gonna talk to me again. She's convinced that she's in love with this guy. I seriously think he's dangerously disturbed. He even had something to do with Becca's friend, Jackie, getting hurt last night, possibly others. Has he done anything to Becca? No. No, she's safe at school. I checked before I came here. But I can't keep her away from him. And if I keep rejecting him, he might take it out on her. Where do I find him? Well, I called the flower shop where he bought most of the gifts this morning. I convinced them that I was gonna return the favor, so they gave me his address. I'll pay this Adam Lance a visit and make sure he never gets near you or Becca again. Hello, Adam. Remember me? Mr. Foley? Gale's ex. Can I help you with something? Can we talk inside for a minute? Actually, I'd prefer we talk out here. Are you hiding something in there? Just my clutter. Just my clutter, huh? So... Is it true you're dating my daughter and sleeping with my wife? Oh, how do I answer? What can I say? You have great taste in women. Come on, man. You stay away from Becca and Gale, got it? No! No? You got a death wish, boy? Gale loves me! You had your chance and you blew it. Uh-uh. Gale hates you, Adam. And she sent me over here to make that absolutely clear. I don't believe you. I don't. You're just so mad because I have what you once had. You can't stand the fact that she loves me. You're just like the rest of them, man. You're a bad father and an even worse husband. And without you in the picture, Gale, Becca and I, we're gonna be happy. We're gonna be really happy. You need some serious help, son. I am not your son! And you can hit me as much as you want 'cause you can't break me. So hit me, man! Hit me! Dude, hit me, dude! Hit me! Hit me, please! Hit me, dude! Hit me! You're all kinds of crazy and I'm gonna see to it that you're locked up so you never get near my wife and daughter again. That's a promise. We'll see, Tony. We will see. How could you? Honey, what's wrong? You know what's wrong! You practically beat my boyfriend to death. What? No, I didn't. Come inside. No! I saw what you did to him! He sent me pictures! Yeah, he was too ashamed to see me in person. I only hit him once. Look! Look at him! He's covered in bruises! You nearly broke his arm! And he told me you trashed his place, too. I never went in his place. I didn't do any of this. So he did it to himself, hmm? Becca, this guy, he is a sick man. He is not right in the head. I think his parents did something to him when he was young, abused him or... Oh, he was abused, all right. And here's the proof. Becca, this... He's gonna get a restraining order against you and I don't even blame him! Becca, this is all a lie. Stay out of my life! I never want to see you again! Becca, wait... Stay out of my life! - Becca! - Stay out! Becca, wait! Becca, come on! What was that all about, Tony? Let's go back inside. I just told you to talk to him, Tony. Threaten him, maybe, not beat him to a pulp! He sent all the pictures to my cell phone along with more love notes. I swear I only hit him once, Gale, not even that hard. Well, that's gonna be impossible to prove. Do you know where Becca is? Did she say where she was going? Was she heading home? I don't know. I hope so. Call me as soon as she gets in? Let me know she's safe? Okay, I will. Bye, Tony. Come on, Tony. You've got to calm down and relax. I need to find my daughter. No, you don't. You need to give her some space. When I was 18 and my parents got on my case, if I didn't get some alone time, it just made everything worse. And y'all need to cool down. Let's get in the jacuzzi. I don't think that's gonna help. It always works for me. All right. I need my cell phone in case Gale calls back. I'll go get it. I'll be right back. Hey, what's up with this water? What is it? I don't know. It's just... It's like it's too hot! Like burning me! Tony, are you okay? It's burning my skin! Tony! Honey! It's burning! Help! Thank you, Miss Sullivan. I'll let you know if we have any more further questions. Okay. Thank you. How is he? He's sleeping now. They gave him a sedative. And the doctor said he'll be okay in a couple of days. But his skin and eyes were badly burned by some calcium chemical in the jacuzzi. In the jacuzzi? Some bleach or something. I don't know how it got in there. Oh, look at you, cutting class. I must be a bad influence. Whose place is this? Yours? I wish. Are we allowed in here? Sure. It's one of my client's pools. I'm house sitting while they're away. Are we at the Playboy Mansion? Why? Do you feel like getting naked? No. I feel like we're getting into trouble. What did I tell you? We got the whole place to ourselves for the weekend. Let's go for a dip. I didn't bring my suit. Neither did I. Umm... I mean, how many times do you get to do this, right? It's a beautiful pool. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this. Becca? I don't know. Do you just need some convincing? No. Not here. Come on, come on. - Not in broad daylight. - Come on, come on, come on. I want to see what your mother created. What? Why did you say it like that? Why... your mother gave birth to something... why are you ashamed of your body? I'm not ashamed of my body! I just think it's weird that you're talking about my mom while we're making out, especially since she hates you. Don't say that. Don't say... Gale's just confused. Excuse me? She'll come around once she realizes what she's missing. What are you saying, Adam? Becca, you won't understand. No! Do you have a thing for my mom? We have something special, Becca... Gale and I. I told you once. You won't under... I don't want to understand! Becca. Becca! Becca! Becca, what are you doing? This is why I can't date younger girls! Don't you get it? Don't you get it? You don't understand intimacy! And you can't handle a real relationship. God, but your mother could. Your mother could. In fact, she loved it. She did, she loved it. No! It's not funny! - My God. - You're sick. My dad was right! You're dad's a loser and he got what he deserved. Woo! It's Jackie. Jackie too, man. She should stop wandering around in the dark and messing around with other peoples' affairs. It can get dangerous. It can. What is it? Becca, what is it? Jackie! What are you doing back at work so soon? I told her not to come back until she was ready. I don't like sitting around the house. Besides, Greggy here has been giving me free ice cream and I'm getting great pity tips from all the regulars. It's pretty sweet. I'm sorry... for everything. You were right. Adam's weird. He's delusional! I was just looking out for my best friend. I know that now. When did you send this text message? Right after I called you and told you I spoke to your mom about that woman that died in your house. Did you leave a voicemail? Becca, you picked up and then sent that text message. I never picked up that call and I never sent this text message. Becca, please tell me it's over between you two. It is. Does he know that? I sure hope so. Why? Because he's staring at us right now. I'm calling the police. Cup of Chocolate Mint? We'd be better off with a gun! Hello? I'd like to speak to Detective Davidson! Yes, I'll hold! Who was that? My ex-boyfriend. Where do you think he's headed? I've got to get home to check on my mom! - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Be careful! I will. Well, it's all ready for the new water. You sure you don't want me to start the hoses? It'd take maybe a day or two to fill. Oh, let's do it tomorrow, it's getting late. Okay. Whatever you say. Great. Oh, could you lock up the back gate when you leave? I think I can manage that. Thanks. You're the best. Why hire the rest when you can get the best, I always say. Hello? Mrs. Foley? Detective Davidson here. Looks like we got a lucky break. We found a print at Mr. Foley's place. It was on the side of the jacuzzi. It belongs to Adam Lance. Okay, wait a second. So you had his fingerprints on file? That means that he must have a record. I did some digging. His old file was sealed, but I pulled a few strings. Why was it sealed? Because he was 14, still a minor, when his father was found murdered. Are you saying that he killed his own father? They couldn't prove it. His mother provided an alibi for Adam. But there was speculation that they planned the crime together. Adam and his mother were close. I mean, disturbingly so. Oh, my God. - Mom! - Rebecca. Oh, Mom! Are you okay? Yes! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry for everything! It's okay! For how I treated you and dad and everything. Sweetheart, all that matters is you're safe, okay? All right, come here. I love you. You're far from the best, Carlton. This is my house. We only need one pool boy, right? Come on, come on. Mrs. Foley? Hello? Mrs. Foley? Mrs. Foley! Yes, I'm sorry. I'm right here and my daughter just got home. Good. Ask her if she knows where Adam Lance currently is. Where's Adam? I never want to see him again! You were right. I think he's dangerous, disturbed. When did you last see him? He was in a car and he was staring at Jackie and me like he wanted to kill us. I was afraid he was heading here to see you. Did you hear that, Davidson? Yes. Maybe it'd be best if you guys go away for a little while. Check into a hotel tonight until we've located him. Yeah. I think that's a great idea. Please call me as soon as you have him in custody. You got it. Mom, Adam... he was like a different person today. He didn't want me anymore. He wanted you. It was like he was in love with you. He's not well. Honey, he needs help, help that neither one of us can give him. But he made it sound like you guys were sleeping together. That's not true, Mom, is it? Is it? We'll discuss this later. Just go pack a bag. We're staying somewhere else tonight. Answer me, Mom! Did you have sex with Adam? It was just once, okay? It was a mistake. And it happened a long time before you started going out with him. Why didn't you tell me? I wasn't proud of it. Your dad came by with Cindi. I was feeling vulnerable. It had been a long time. I ended it immediately, okay? I knew it was wrong. So all this time, he was just using me. Baby, you fell for his charms. We both did, okay? But he's still out there and he knows where we live, okay? So I need you to be strong for me. Can you do that? Okay, okay. I'll go pack my things. All right. I'll be right up, okay? Oh, God. You almost ready? Almost! Mom! He's... Honey? You okay? Becca? - Becca! - Let her rest. She's had a rough day. You both have, but, uh... Don't worry. I'm gonna make everything better. Becca? Becca! Becca? Oh, my God, perfect timing. Dinner's almost ready, my love. What is this? This is the first date, a proper first date. No distractions. Want to dance? All right. This is nice. Adam? I used to dance with my mother like this. Where's my daughter? Oh, she's retired for the night. She, uh... She won't be bothering us anymore. What do you mean by that? What do you think I mean by that? You gotta forget about her. It's just me and you now. Don't you get it? It's the way it's meant to be. Like with Rhonda Phillips? Rhonda was a disappointment. Rhonda couldn't... handle what we had. Rhonda wanted out of the relationship! So I let her out. Permanently. Just like with your father? Don't bring him up! You don't know the first thing about my father. He was a bad man. He was a bad man. And my mother felt the same way about him. She wanted me all to herself. He didn't understand what we had. Nobody understood what we had! So I had to get rid of everybody who stood in our way. And that's exactly what's going on with me and you, Gale. That's exactly what's going on with me and you, Gale! - What are you doing? - Where's Becca? Where's Becca? That's exactly what's going on between me and you, Gale! I've gotten rid of everybody who stood in our way so we could be happy! Becca is in your past now. Gale, look at me. Becca's in your past and I'm your future. I'm your future. It's a past that doesn't exist anymore and I'm your future. Look at me. I am your future. What is that? What is that? It's water, Gale. What do you mean? Becca! Let her go! Let her go. She's just dead weight now. Without her and your ex-husband, it's just us. We can have a better life, a new life! - Gale, please! - Get off me! Mom! It's okay, baby! I'm coming! Let's get you out of here. Okay, okay, okay. You're gonna be okay! Very disappointing, Gale, very disappointing. Back in the house! Where's your cell phone? I don't know. He must have taken them. Open it! The door! Now! Quick! Ladies? Playing hard to get? I thought we were past that point in our relationship. Upstairs! Quick! Come on! Come on! Come on! This isn't gonna hold him. Gale, I'm done playing games! Bathroom, come on. Come on! Come on, please. It's us. End of the line, ladies. We need some kind of weapon. Uh... Um... Oh, Gale. Gale? Gale! Turn on the bathtub and plug the drain! - Why? - Just do it! Okay. I'm so disappointed. Oh, ho, ho. Oh... Turns out, Gale, you weren't worthy of my love. That's a damn shame. Turns out none of you were. None of you. Don't move a muscle! Get next door, and call the police. You're not talking yourself out of this one, son.
