Don't worry about a thing. Just live up to your part of the deal and this will all be over soon. Fucking traitor! Nobody crosses Arias and lives to tell about it! You friends are waiting for you. Ramon. Good to see you, mi amigo. Come. Welcome to Miami. He's in. Be careful, babe. You have something for me? Nice. Should I count this? Nah, I trust you. Besides. The people who tried to rob Mr. Arias... sing soprano. Snipers in position. Two guards by the patio. Cover. Prepare to move in. I'm looking forward to working with you. What the fuck is this? I didn't call anyone in. What the hell is going on out there? Still holding all our positions, sir. Shots fired! Move in. Execute, execute! The rear stairwell! Slight change of plans. Get down. - Target sighted. - Take him out. Hold the cash, I'll get the emeralds. FBI! Drop your weapon! Drop it now! - He's taking the front stairwell. - Look out! Look out! Move out. I got the stones! Let's get outta here! Honey, can you hear me? We're clear! Ramon, don't leave me, man! We're in this together. Ramon! It's all right, he's with us. Nobody crosses Arias and lives to tell about it. Son-of-a-bitch! Your life in fucking over! Fucking traitor! No one can protect you! We'll find you! -Boo! -Ah! Ugh! You always do that to me. Yeah, but I love it. Hello. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! It's about time. My friends want to see some magic. -Oh, I don't know. -Please. Okay. I'll be back. Okay! Who's ready for some magic? Hey! Over here! - She loves this. - Okay, everybody ready? Ta-da! Okay, birthday girl. Pick a card, any card. But Dad, you always do this trick. Yes, but it works on you every time. Besides, it's the only one I know. Come on. Okay... Now... Put it back. What do you have there? Alley-hoop! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. As I said, it works every time. -How did you do that? -Uh-uh. A magician never reveals his secrets. -Dad! -Once you figure it out, I'll think of something new, okay? Besides, I think you have more important things to think about right now. Good news. The hunt is over. Who wants cake? Me! The story on how we met is even better. Anyway, the vineyard I was working for in Napa wanted to expand their business to Europe. So they sent me to evaluate a winery that was operating out of an old mesia?? that was for sale. And I was their head wine maker. I kept asking her to sample my wines and give me her opinion. Little did I know, he was trying to get into my pants. It worked, didn't it? Nah, I knew I had to make this woman my wife. She was beautiful, easy to get along with, great cook, and most importantly, had the same passion for what I do. What more can a man ask for? Sounds like a match made in heaven. He proposed to me in the garden of the old mesia. Down on one knee in front of the pool, diamond ring and all. I can't believe you never told us this story. -How romantic. -So, what happened with that mesia? Oscar and I decided to open up our own vineyard in Penedes. With Connie's legal advice, of course. But we go to the mesia every year. Some couples have their song. -We have our place. -Mmm... Oh, I'm being a terrible hostess. Let me get you some more wine. -Please. -Thank you, honey. How about you, Raphael? There's got to be a good story behind how you landed this fine, young lady. Now that story's better left for another time. Oh, I see. Did you arrest her? What are you doing, silly? I'm showing Emma how to dance. You are? -Boo! -Ah! God, you're always doing that to me. -Because it's fun. -Yeah, for who? -For me. Ew! Gross! Oh, listen, did you bring home a bottle of wine from the year Christie was born? I'm so sorry. It's okay, we'll just... have to break family tradition for one year. You know what? I'll go by the winery and pick one up. -Really? -Yeah. Ten minutes. No one will know I'm gone. Oh, honey, you're the best. I know. -See you soon. -Okay. Hey, are you enjoying the party? I'll be back in a minute, okay? Where are you going, Daddy? I have to run to the winery real quick. Want to keep me company? Can Emma come too? Sure! Let's go. Okay... I'm gonna take the birthday girl with me. Okay, honey. Hurry back. Okay, let's go, honey. BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP Okay... Lady... We'll only be a minute, honey. Are you sure Emma wouldn't like to wait in the car? She gets lonely. Okay, bring her. Hold on, honey. Let's play hide and seek. In a minute, honey. 2000... You can't find me. 1999. We'll find you! Daddy! You can't find me! Keep hiding, honey. I will find you. Thanks for coming. Sorry Oscar and Christie couldn't be here to say goodbye. -Goodbye. -Buenas noches. Something's not right. It's not like Oscar not to call. Well, maybe some last minute business came up. It'll be okay. He's not answering. Something's wrong. I'm going over there. Let me take my car. You're a little shook up. There's his car. Well, at least they're here. I told you. You were right. I shouldn't have worried. Ahhh! Oh, my God! Oh no! You can't go in there! My baby! No! No! Another one. Come on, take it. Take it. Give me the ball! Can you get it? Hello, Mommy. Thank you. I just felt like being outside for a little while. This is all like a bad dream. I keep thinking I'm gonna wake up. Think I'm gonna come down the hall and see... Oscar and Christie playing hide and seek. If I hadn't asked Oscar to go pick up that bottle of wine, none of this would have happened. Laura, stop. You're gonna drive yourself crazy thinking, "What if you did this? What if you did that?" You can't blame yourself over something that is not your fault. But I can't stay here anymore. Everywhere I turn... there are memories of a life... that I once had. Thanks for handling everything for me over the past few days. Oh, it's the least I could do. Lawyers aren't as ruthless as everyone thinks. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Mrs. Martine... Yes. Hi, my name is Frank Keenan. I'm with the US Embassy. First, let me just say how sorry I am about your loss. I'm writing up the report on your daughter and I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk... in private. You know, I've given... all the details to the proper authorities. So if you have any more questions... I really think you should contact them. I have some information you might be interested in. So I hear you're headed back to the states. Yeah, there's nothing for me here anymore. So why is someone from the US Embassy so interested in my daughter's death? Oh, in cases like this, where the death's not from natural causes, it's standard procedure for the embassy to make its own report. Christie was, of course, an American citizen, courtesy of your nationality. Did you husband have any enemies, Mrs. Martine? Enemies? Oscar was a wine maker. Everybody loved him. Why? I inspected the site. -Don't know how to put this... -Please, go on. Okay. The debris contained large quantities of evaporated ammonium nitrate. It's odorless, it's highly combustible and hard to trace. I'm sorry. I don't know what you're trying to tell me. The nitrate is a combustible. It's a top choice for arsonists. I'm sorry, Mrs. Martine. This was arson. -Did you know? -Did I know what? -Calm down. -Don't tell me to calm down. Did you know? About what? About the ammonium nitrate. I don't believe I've had the pleasure. Frank Keenan... I'm with the US Embassy. A lot of big fish interested in this small fire. What do you mean? Interpol arrived before the building finished smoldering. They found your daughter's body. Interpol? I thought they only handled criminal cases. So you did know. Now, you don't understand. It's not... Oh, don't tell me... Don't talk to me like that! My husband and daughter were murdered... And you didn't tell me about it. You are a friend. How could you do that to me? -To protect you. -Protect me? From who? The killers? Why aren't you out there looking for them? Because we know who did it. Laura... It looks like... It was Oscar. -What? -It is still a bit early in the investigation to jump to conclusions, but the evidence is pointing to the fact that Oscar set the fire himself and was caught in his own accident. Now that's just... That's just crazy. Oscar would never put Christie at risk like that. Believe me. I'm as astonished as you are. I'm just looking at the facts here. Were you aware he recently increased his insurance coverage on the winery? That's just impossible. He would never do something like that without telling me. Ask Connie. She's you and your husband's legal representative. I'm surprised she didn't tell you about this. Perhaps you didn't know him as well as you thought. Forget what Navarro said. He's only trying to close the case. Yeah, but why would Raphael lie? It doesn't make any sense. Maybe he is telling the truth. It's just... Oscar wouldn't do something like that. He wasn't that type of person. It sounds like there are a lot of unanswered questions. Well, I'm not going anywhere until I find out what's going on. Look, I know what you're going through. Believe me. But there's nothing for you here. Just let me look. I need to see it for myself. Where do you wanna start? I wanna see where they were found. Christie was found here. They said she was probably hiding when the fire started. And Oscar? It's this way. He was probably trying to get to Christie when the smoke became too much for him. Christie! Christie, where are you? What's this? Oh, it's just... A back stairway that leads outside. But it's always locked. This wasn't mentioned in the report. Could Oscar have come down this way? We never use it. That's weird. What is it? Emma. Can Emma come too? I'm gonna take the birthday girl with me. I just don't know how she got outside. Well, there must be a reason for it. They had to have come in that way. Christie would never leave Emma alone. She took Emma everywhere with her. Raphael said Interpol discovered her body. -Yes. -How could the police and fire department miss her? -That's a very good question. -Wait a sec. Is it common for Interpol to get involved in cases of arson? Not that I'm aware of. You know, the police have been withholding the truth from me. Why should Interpol be any different? Do you think it's possible that I could see their report? Oh, I suppose I could put in a formal request for a copy. It might take six or eight weeks. That long? Yeah, there's another way. You could actually make the request yourself. As the only living family member, they're required to share it with you. It might be faster. All right, so what do I have to do? Nothing, I'll fill out all the paperwork for you tomorrow. All you have to do is sign it. Thank you. You should just go home and get some sleep. I'm never going to sleep again. -Good morning, Inspector. -Mr. Keenan. What can I do for you today? Any more theories for me to look into? Please, come in. No, actually, Laura's appealed to the embassy for assistance. I have a formal request for a copy of the case file. Mr. Keenan, what am I going to do with you? You're going to give me that file. I'm afraid it's not that easy. I don't think you understand. No, I'm afraid you don't understand. That file is classified. Classified? This isn't a state secret. This is arson, isn't it? Are you aware of the term, "Non-cooperation?" Do you have any idea what that means? Do you want me to call the ambassador right now? If you'd like, but be sure and tell him to call Interpol if he wants any answers. Mr. Keenan, please understand I'm not trying to be difficult. The Martine's were very good friends of mine, but this matter goes above all our heads. I'm sure it does. Thanks very much for all your help. Hi, put me through to Agent Tremayne please. Retirement planning? Thank you, love. Did you know, that Lord Byron toyed with the idea of purchasing an entire Spanish island for his very own? The virgin land appealed to him. The virgin land? Or the virgin shepherd girls? Ah, cynical youth. You have a call one line one, Inspector Navarro. Thank you. Tremayne here, what can I do for you, Inspector? I see. No, no, not to worry. I appreciate your concern. We have everything under control. Yes, good day, Inspector. I'm not sure if staying here is the best option for you. Well, it doesn't really matter what you think, does it? Laura, you're not being yourself. What is this Keenan doing to you? He's not doing anything. So far, he's the only one who's been honest with me. What do you mean by that? Did you know that Oscar increased the coverage of the insurance policy? What are you talking about? What is this Keenan doing to your mind? Don't change the subject. Did you know about the insurance policy? What insurance policy? Don't play games with me, Connie. Rafael Navarro told me about the increase in the coverage. They think Oscar planned this whole thing. What? That can't be! I handle all the business affairs of the winery. If he had changed anything, I would have known. Well, is it possible that... he could have done it without your knowledge? He could of, but why? Laura, listen to me. Oscar was a good man and a great father. He never would have done anything to ever hurt you nor Christie. I'm not quite sure what is going on but I can assure you that none of this mess was his doing. I'm sorry, Connie. My mind is just not in the right place these days. You don't have to say anything. Right now you're going through more than anyone could handle. Listen, when I get home, I'll make some phone calls and I'll try to find out as much as possible about this so-called policy. All right? Excuse me. Hey. Morning. Did you get the report? Interpol has it classified under national jurisdiction. You mean international jurisdiction. Interpol is an international agency. -I'll see you later. -Bye. Sorry, my mistake. Come in. So you two are pretty good friends. Yeah, I've known her since I moved to Spain. This doesn't make any sense. Why is Interpol so involved? Maybe they were investigating Oscar. Why was I never asked to ID the bodies? It's standard procedure not to show the bodies to the family members when they're so severely burned. Then how did they identify them? Well, the official report stated that the dental records and DNA matched. The official classified report. Exactly. Those reports have to be classified for a reason. Now maybe that was so no one could double check the DNA tests and dental records. What are you saying, Frank? Are you saying the bodies in the cemetery... If there were any bodies there at all. You mean my family may not have burned in that fire? There's only one way to find out. I can't believe we're doing this. All right, here we go. I guess I was wrong. Don't... I'm very sorry. You must really hate me. No, Frank. Well, I got your hopes up. You were just looking at the facts. These cases, I always try to tell myself not to get emotionally involved. You're a nice man, you can't help but care. Oh, Jesus. God. Don't worry. I can't believe this. I'll get it, just sit here and relax. -No, are you sure? -Yeah, absolutely. I'll clean this up and pour you another glass. Shh, it's me. It's me, Oscar. Oh my god! Oh my god! Rafael. It's Laura, please hurry and get here. They're gonna kill each other! It's Oscar! Oscar's here! Oscar, no! Where's Christie! Oscar, wait! Where's Christie? Where is she? We've put out a call to all the others. Laura, it might sound stupid, but I have to ask, are you sure it was Oscar? Yes! Rafael, I know my own husband. And you, you saw him too? Pretty solid for a ghost. Look, Rafael. If Oscar is alive, then maybe Christie is. The body was identified by her DNA and dental records. As was Oscar's? I am as astonished as you are. Laura, look. Laura, I don't know what to say. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'm sorry. Be careful. Is there some place you can stay tonight? I wanna stay here. Laura, your husband faked his own death. He came back here with a gun. Who knows what he might have done if I hadn't been here. It's not safe. He wasn't trying to hurt me. Then what was he doing here? He has to be after something. Well, he did say there was something he had to tell me. What? Is there something you know that he might not want you to tell anybody else? Think! What about someone who might help him. A family member. Oscar doesn't have any family. He moved here from Madrid right after his parents died. You know, he used to tell Christie stories about how strict his teachers were at the school he went to. Maybe there's somebody there who might remember him. Or they might have a record. We should probably go there. I appreciate everything you've done for me, Frank. But I think this is something I have to do on my own. Sure, I understand. Listen, I should go. I can see myself out. Remember, I'm only a phone call away if you need anything. Thank you. Thanks for everything. Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. Hello, Mrs. Navarro. Yes, this is Laura Martine. I'm all right, thanks. Listen, could you do me a favor? Rafael told me about a private detective that he was very close to from Madrid. Senor Sena? -Ah, you must be Mrs. Martine? -Yes. Please, please. Thank you, I really appreciate you doing this on such short notice. It's no problem. Any friend of Navarro is a friend of mine. But I have one question. Why have you come to Madrid? We live in modern times. I could have faxed my report to you. Well, I wanted to look around for myself. I understand, but this job is best left to the professionals. So, what have you found out? Nothing. Nothing? What do you mean nothing? Zero. I started looking into Mr. Martine's life after the telephone call. I used all the normal sources, but I have found nothing. National identity. Driving license. Everything came up blank. But that's impossible. I mean Oscar told me stories about growing up here. I'm very sorry, but Oscar is a ghost. He does not exist. Who the hell was I married too? I'm sorry. I have been with the school for almost 40 years and we have no records of a student named Oscar Martine. Are you positive? I mean, I have this... I have a picture. No. I remember all the student faces, but I haven't seen him before. I mean, are you sure? It has been a while. My dear, if any of those stories he told you were true, I could definitely remember such a troublesome student. Well, thank you for your time. Sorry. Mommy. Well, it's a dead-end. Everything Oscar told me was a lie. His name, Martine? The name he gave me? Doesn't even belong to him. I don't even know who I am anymore. A man can't just appear and disappear without leaving any evidence. We will find him, I promise you that. Well, I'm gonna hold you to that promise. Ah, I just might have to keep it. When are you coming back? Tomorrow. You want me to pick you up at the airport? That'd be nice. Okay. I'll see you there, partner. All right, bye. What, you changed your mind? Laura, it's Alfonso Sena. I have found some information. Yeah? What is it? It's very important I show you. Meet me at the gallery at 97 Cervano street. A gallery? Senor Sena? Hello? Hello. Senor Sena? Is anyone here? Hello? Oh. Excuse me, but I'm here to meet someone. Maybe you know him. I never understood why my father had such an infatuation with doors. Because I grow older, I think I am beginning to understand why. Um... Behind doors, people hide their secrets. Their most inner desires. Some people's doors are open for everyone to see inside. And others are sealed shut, afraid to let anyone in. I'm sorry, I... I must have the wrong place. Leaving so soon Mrs. Martine? We have many doors for you to go through this evening. My friend knows I was here tonight. You like? Colombian, the best. None of that Cuban shit. Good. I detest women who smoke. I'll have one. Umberto Arias. My daughter, Natalia. She likes to test me. It is very hard to raise a child these days, properly. I'm sure you can relate. I don't know what I would do if I was to lose her to a terrible accident. If that is what it was. What do you know about my daughter? What do you know about Madrid? I despise ignorance. You should know a few things about the country you live in. In ancient times, this city was the center of the world. Spain was the greatest superpower on Earth. Their ships spread across the globe. Bringing the Word of God and the Sword of Castile to the native people. Ha! Bullshit. They destroyed Latin America. Burned cities, enslaved people, ruined entire civilizations. Now, we Colombians are returning the favor. Payback is a bitch, right? So, what does this have to do with you? Do you know why I had you brought here? No. We're looking for your husband, Ramon. Ramon? I don't like games, Mrs. Martine. I do! Why don't you let me have her for a couple of hours. Shut up, Hector. You must forgive Hector. He's still bitter about spending the last ten years of his life in prison. Courtesy of your husband. And you know, in all the years he was in prison he never cut a deal or mentioned my name. Now, that is loyalty. Something your husband knows nothing about. Look in the dark waters. During the day it's very pretty. Families can rent rowboats. Children play along the banks. But these waters hold many dark secrets. This is where your husband killed his first man. He was 16. What? He walked up behind him, put a pistol to his head and shot ten times. And then he disposed of the body, in the lake. You're making this up. Am I? The man you know as Oscar Martine was an assassin. And a smuggler. He decided to expand his trade to Miami ten years ago. I was impressed with his rise to power. I welcomed him with open arms. And do you know how he repaid me? He turned to the FBI. Several of my men were lost. I should skin that rat alive. I should wipe out everyone he loves. Where is he! Where is he! I would tell you if I knew! I don't care about him anymore! All I care about is if my daughter is alive! You know what Mrs. Martine? I believe you. The police, they cannot help you. Your detective friend was killed because he asked too many questions. Don't you make the same mistake. If Ramon contacts you, call us. Mrs. Martine, I truly hope you find out what happened to your daughter. No, Connie, really, I'm fine. Oh, thanks, but Frank's picking me up at the airport. Did you hear anything about the insurance policy? Nothing. The authorities have everything under lock and key. I can't even access the company's bank account now that they think that Oscar is still out there. Then I talked to every single insurance carrier that I know of and nobody knows anything. Yeah, well I'm starting to think there is no insurance policy. I'll explain later. -See you tonight. -All right. Bye. I was so worried about you. It's good to see you. -You sure you're all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little shook up. I can't believe you actually met Umberto Arias, head of the Colombian mafia and lived to tell about it. Yeah, well he wants me alive for some reason. What did he say? I don't think we should talk in here, I'll you everything outside. We've got a visual. All right, let me figure this out. Oscar, or Ramon, whatever his name is. He turns Arias over to the FBI and then disappears. Moves back to Europe. Gets married. Has a family. Life is good. Then they find him and come after him. So, he stages his own death and disappears. Hopefully taking Christie with him. But after all that, why would he risk getting caught? He must be looking for something. Laura Martine? Hey! What the hell is this? We are with Interpol. Please. Mrs. Martine, Mr. Keenan. Nigel Tremayne, pleasure. Where's my daughter? Now you know my colleagues, Ortiz and Fuentes. You said Oscar was dead and he's alive. Is Christie alive too? I understand that you've been meeting with some old friends of Ramon's. Some very dangerous friends. And I must insist that you cease these investigations, less they take a turn for the worse. You're protecting him, why? Why is Oscar, Ramon, so valuable to you? Oscar Martine is a key witness. He was helping us, along with the FBI to dismantle a good part of the Colombian mafia. Well, what about Umberto Arias? We haven't been able to link him to anything, yet. The problem is... after the incident in Miami, Arias wouldn't show his face. Well, he sure showed it to me last night. He told me everything. That's not enough. It's your word against his. Really? I never thought my credibility would be questioned against the head of the Colombian mafia. Mrs. Martine, you're lucky to be alive. Which is why you must stop playing private investigator. Immediately. Do you really think I'm going to stop looking for my daughter? Mrs. Martine, this is not a request. So, Oscar was in the witness protection program. You gave him his name, his identity, you set up his life. What was I? Good cover? If it's any consolation, he genuinely loved you. Really? How the hell would you know? Please, just let me talk to him. I'm afraid I can't. He called us after the hitman attacked at the winery and disappeared. Did he take Christie? Answer me! Yes or no? This is not a tough question! Is she alive or not? You don't know, do you? So what about the bodies? You wanted the Colombians to think he was dead. You burned down the winery. And one of the bodies was a hitman. What about the kid? Was that some Jane Doe you picked up at the morgue? You've got quite an imagination Mr. Keenan. And the insurance policy? You fabricated the whole thing just to cover your mess? From where I'm standing, the only difference between you people and Arias is a badge. There are occasions when the few must be inconvenienced for the greater good. It might be difficult to believe, but this is for your own good. The less you are involved, the better. Listen, Mr...Agent Tremayne. I became involved when my daughter became involved. You can threaten me all you want, but I will stay involved, until I find her. You're a courageous woman, Mrs. Martine. But it might just get you killed. You were great in there, you didn't let that guy scare you one bit. Yeah, well I'm sick of being lied to. I can't believe I've been played like this. You know, I've gotta call Connie. Laura, I really don't think that's a good idea. Frank, I accused her of lying to me. I know, it's just, I really don't think we should talk to anybody until we figure this whole thing out. For their safety, as well as our own. Yeah, you're probably right. Do you mind if I took a cab home? I think I need to walk, be alone, clear my head for a while. Your mind must be going a hundred miles a minute with all of this. Listen, if you need anything at all, just call me on my cell phone, okay? Thanks. You're welcome. Laura...call me. I have a boy, myself. Your husband really wanted to start a new life. He cut the deal to sell out the Colombians in Miami because he knew it was his only way out. But the deal went bad. What the fuck is this? Shots fired. Move in. At the time, we thought a rogue agent was involved. Slight change of plans. But we are beginning to believe it may have been someone working with Ramon. Why would someone be working with him? He was an informant. We're not sure. But he may have taken something from the scene. I've got the stones. Search your house. Check your bank records. for any unusual holdings or safety deposit boxes. Find what they are looking for and it may lead you to your daughter. So she is alive. I didn't say that. Where did I put his card? Hello operator? Yes, could you please give me the number to the American embassy? -US embassy, may I help you? -Yes, hi... I'm trying to reach Frank Keenan? I'm sorry, Mr. Keenan isn't in right now. May I take a message? Yeah, will you have him call Laura Martine as soon as possible? He already has my cell phone but I want to give you my home phone just in case he wants to call me there. Hi. What are you doing here? Uh, I just came by to drop off Laura's bag. How did you get in? -Back door was unlocked. -That's very strange. I'm sure I locked it before she went to Madrid. -Hello? -US embassy calling for Laura Martine? US embassy? Uh, well, Mrs. Martine is not in right now. This is her friend Connie. You can reach her at her cell phone at 555-998-7531. Or I can take a message if you'd like. Yes, this is Frank Keenan returning her call. Frank Keenan? -Ha, that's very strange... -Well... -It's a bit awkward. -Hello? Connie? Connie? Where are you? Connie? Connie? Oh my God, no! Oh Connie! Make one move and you're dead. Are you okay? -Kind of tense. -I was made. By wifey? -No, her friend. -And? I took care of it. -What about wifey? -Not yet. I still need her to lead us to Ramon. And our lost treasure. Ramon, don't leave me, man. We're in this together. What have you gotten us into do? That motherfucker Ramon... -He left me there to die. -Don't worry. We will get our revenge. I must have been crazy, Falling in love with a boy from another camp. It's very Romeo and Juliette of us. Don't say that, don't. Romeo and Juliette both die at the end. Yes but in our ending we screw both sides and live happily ever after. I'm really sorry you couldn't reach me last night. I had an important meeting. That's alright. Raphael brought me to the hotel. -Oh, thanks for bringing my suitcase. -Oh, it's no problem. So sorry about Connie. -Think it was Oscar? -I don't know. I mean, I don't know why Oscar would want to hurt her. He loved her. He loved you too supposedly. I'm sorry, I have a way of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. We'll figure this whole thing out together. I promise. Get in! Help! Oh my God, slow down! Slow down! Oh God! Ah! Frank, what are you doing? Stop! Frank! Slow down! Stop! Laura, this is getting too dangerous. Why don't you stay with us for a while? Oh now you suddenly want to help me. Listen I understand why you are angry with me. But please realize that I had no idea what was going on. Interpol stepped in and there was nothing I could do. Well, well, well. If it isn't Starsky and Hutch. I'll take it from here, Inspector. My offer still stands. If you need anything, give me a call. All right. I thought I was clear when I told you not to get involved. I could have you both arrested for endangering innocent civilians. And Mr. Keenan... I don't know who you think you are. But I've quite had enough of your interference. I suppose I shall have to call your superiors. Be my guest. I'm sure they'd be interested to know of the extreme negligence with which you've handled this case. Excuse me. -Hello? -Mrs. Martine? This is Frank Keenan from the US embassy returning your call. -Oh, hello. -I called your home yesterday and spoke with Mrs. Connie Clayton. You spoke with Connie? Yes, she gave me your cell number and then hung up. I tried calling back but there was no answer. -What can I do for you? -Well, thank you for returning my call. It was nothing important. I think I have everything figured out. -Alright then. Call me back if you change your mind. -I will. Thank you. Everything okay? -Oh... -Who was that? Uh, just... Just a friend. I'm a bit overwhelmed, it's a bit of a rough day. Yeah, I understand. Well, we should probably get you a cab, get you back to the hotel. -Get some sleep. -Uh, you know... I was thinking that... Maybe I should get a ride... From Raphael. I think it would be safer. Oh. Okay. Yeah, you're probably right. Who knows what Oscar will do next. Ok well, I'll see you. Yeah, okay. He proposed to me in the garden of the old mesia?? Down on my knee in front of the pool, diamond ring and all. Uh! Why do you treat him like that? That's a good man. He loves you. Hector loves Hector. He lusts after me. You make a good match together. I won't be around forever, you know. You need someone strong to run the family business. I couldn't agree more, Papa. Good girl. Always look out after number one. Mrs. Martine. She wants to speak to you. -Mrs. Martine. -How much is Oscar worth to you? -What do you mean? -How much is he worth to you? -I didn't know you could be so mercenary. -I want a deal. What makes you feel you can trust me? Since this whole nightmare began, every single person has lied to me. In fact, only one person has been completely honest. You understand me perfectly. What is it you want in exchange? Interesting. If you think you can deliver... I will help you get what you want. We have a deal. Goodbye, Mrs. Martine. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. We've got him. Raphael... Remember when you said if I needed anything, to call? I knew you would remember. -You look beautiful. -Uh, don't. Oscar... Or Ramon. Or whatever the hell your name is. -Where's our daughter? -Honey, everything is not as it seems. Oh yes it is. It's very clear to me. The man I married is a murdered. Laura, honey, they sent a man to kill me. I had to protect... -No, where's Christie? -Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Christie! -Where are we going, Mommy? -I'll explain later. Laura, I'm sorry. I thought that chapter of my life was over. I never meant for you and Christie to get involved. You have to believe me. Well, we did. How could you do this to me? How could you do this to us? Please understand. I never wanted to hurt you. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. But after Arias found me, I knew that Interpol could no longer protect us. I had to run with Christie. I tried to come back for you but everyone was looking for me. And when I saw Lafferty there I... -I tried to warn you. -Stop. Do you have any idea... what it feels like to bury your own child? Please just let us go. I'm sorry... No! Daddy! No! Daddy, Daddy. Mommy! Stay there. -Dad! -Please! Please, don't hurt her. You can do whatever you want to us but just let her go. Oh no. See it's not that easy, see. Your man here betrayed me in Miami. And he has something that I want. -And she's my insurance that he will give it to me. -I didn't betray you. No! I told you I was going to take the stuff. And give the money back to the Feds. It was a perfect plan. Nobody would have suspected anything. But you got greedy and burst in like Jesse James. Everything went wrong. People die. I never wanted anyone to get hurt. Don't give me that pacifist bullshit. You're a killer. And you left me to die. But I escaped. And I came back and here I am to return the favor. Your fight is with me. Be a man. Let them go. Maybe I should just -kill her and watch you suffer. -No! Please no! You want a fair fight, huh? Lafferty! If there's any killing to be done today we'll be the ones doing it. She set us up. Been waiting a long time for this Moment. -Let the girl go. -I'll kill her. Very well, then we'll kill you. -No! That wasn't the deal. -I know what the deal was. But there's only one way to deal with a couple of rats. Kill them both. -No! -Mommy! Mommy! -Natalia. -Sorry, Papa. You always taught me to look out for number one. Now let Lafferty go. Just in the nick of time, baby. Run Christie! -Mommy! -Go! Mommy! Drop your weapon! Daddy? My little angel. It's okay. It's okay. I didn't want it to end like this. Shh. Don't talk. Try to hold on. You showed me a new life. A life I didn't deserve. Try to hold on, okay. For however brief our time, you made me a better man. I love you. Take your daughter and start a new life. She needs your strength. We gotta go. Come on, baby. Come on.
