Nana: Dani! Dani: Yes, ma'am? Nana: I always want you to have joy inside your heart. Dani: Okay. Nana: No matter what happens in life, always remember that Jesus loves you. That's a wisdom seed for joy. Dani: What's a wisdom seed? Nana: Baby, a wisdom seed is something someone plants inside your heart so that it'd grow one day. Dani: Like a pretty flower? Nana: Just like a pretty flower. * Secrets, the only way I knew * To live my life * Ashamed of what I held * So deep inside * Will this last * Helpless, a love that I once * knew has left me cold * To face an angry world I once * controlled to my past * Ooooh * I gotta leave it all behind so I * Can try to start my life over again * Ooooh * This is just my chance to get it right * If I fail at least I know I tried * To make it without these * Secrets, harmless and so * Delicate yet dangerous * Friends and loved ones all end * Up forsaken * But I can't turn back Alicia: Ladies night, hey! Andrea: Wow, can't remember the last one. Alicia: I know, I know, if I hadn't moved to Raleigh. Andrea: I didn't say it. Alicia: You could have moved to. Andrea: Licia, don't start. If I hadn't been in Pittsburgh, where would Dani have gone? Besides, my ministry is here. Alicia: She would have come to Raleigh, too. Dani: Some of my best memories are here in Pittsburgh with you guys. I'm just glad we didn't let that stupid rivalry between our fathers keep us apart. Alicia: Remember stayin up late, talking? Andrea: Oh, singing, laughing, watching movies. Dani: Yeah, those were good times. Alicia: But? Dani: Well, you know, playboy Greg and naive me. Andrea: Uh-huh Dani, don't start. Tonight is about us. Just fun, food, and family. Dani: Well, speaking of family, how's your Dad? Alicia: He loves France. We went to go see him last year. Andrea: He needs Jesus, but he thinks everyone's like Grandpa Tim. Dani: At least your dad talks about Grandpa Tim. My dad is still the prodigal. Alicia: Girl, let me tell you, my dad spilled the beans last year. Dani: What do you mean? Alicia: That prodigal son stuff? Is a generational curse. Grandpa Tim was the prodigal son, too. Dani: I didn't know that. Alicia: And there's more. Annie, can you go get some lemonade, please? Andrea: Licia, it's just family gossip. Alicia: It's not family gossip. Grandpa Tim was a womanizer and a shyster. Dani: Hmm, okay now, don't leave me hangin. Alicia: My dad was a part of the madness, too. When he got older he told Grandpa Tim he didn't agree with it. Dani: What happened? My dad never talks about Grandpa Tim. Alicia: Grandpa Tim's church was more like one of those store fronts. You know, the kind that you see on TV, where you change the channel right before you laugh. You know, you pay a dollar for a small blessing, a thousand for a big blessing? Dani: Are you serious? Andrea: Enough of family madness. Twin, let's watch the movie. In 12 hours we have to have you at the airport. Alicia: Don't forget me in North Carolina. And I expect a visit. It has to be longer than a weekend. Dani: I promise, as soon as we get settled we'll come for a visit. Joey: I practiced the hymn for tomorrow. Going out back to play some ball, Nana. Noah: Yeah Nana, he was playin them other songs, too. Can't play no ball, though. Joey: Who won the last game? Noah: Who's gonna win this game? Dani: I'm playin, too. Nana: Dani, sit with me. Dani, hand me my bible. Let's see. Now the slave has no permanent place in the family, but the son belongs forever. So if the son sets you free, you're free indeed. Now you're gettin ready to go to high school. Dani: I know, I can't wait. Nana: Do you know what it means to be free? Dani: I guess so. Nana: Child, I'm talkin really free. Dani: From what? Nana: Free from bondage, from anything except the Lord. Free from the pain, anger, and bitterness. Dani: Noah said he can't wait to leave home. Cause my dad's a bitter old man. Nana: You just remember, if you find yourself bound up in mess, if you seek God, he will truly set you free. And you remember this, too. God sees the sparrow when it falls. Dani: Then why does he let it fall? Nana: You just remember that if God takes time to watch the sparrow, you can rest assured that he sees you. Joey: It's gonna be okay, I'm gonna miss Nana, too. She taught me how to play a piano so well. Noah: Man, don't nobody care about how well you can play the piano. Ain't no more summers in West Virginia now. * Gotta leave it all behind so I can try * To start my life all over again Jason: I love you Danielle Allen Let me make all your dreams come true. Marry me. Reverend Allen: This Greg fellow, he will come back, I promise you that. Stop lying to Josh, tell him the truth. Nana: Now I've planted seeds of wisdom in you. * Ooooh this is just my chance to get it right * Josh: Mama, what's the matter? Dani: Oh, nothing, nothing. Josh: I heard you cryin. You know I hate when you cry. Dani: Everything's okay, really. Josh: What's this? Dani: Love letters. Josh: Oh from when you and Dad were together. Dani: Every Valentine's Day and Anniversary. Josh: Can I read them? Dani: Maybe some of them. Josh: Why not all of them? Dani: Because some things are private between two people. You'll understand that one day when you fall in love. Josh: I'm in love with Nikki. Dani: Real love. Two months from now you guys probably won't even remember each other's name. Josh: Mom! Mom, I don't wanna live in Pittsburgh. I like your house in Columbus. Dani: I used to like it, but it's not the same without your dad. Josh: So you just wanna, forget all about him? Dani: I'll never forget your dad. I know this is hard for you, because it's hard for me. Can you understand that? Josh: Yeah. Dani: Sometimes you have to physically move from a place to move on. Josh: Why couldn't we have done that after I graduated? I promised Nikki I'd take her to the prom. Dani: I'd be willing to make that happen. You give me a three point five, and I'll get you back to Columbus to take Nikki to the prom. Josh: What about me playin ball? Dani: What do you mean? Josh: I can't just walk onto a team my senior year, I mean, I'm trying to get a basketball scholarship! Dani: Oh really? Josh: Yeah, so I can take care of you, Mom. Dani: Josh, you don't have to take care of me. I need you to take care of you. Do you trust me? Josh: Of course, Mom. Love and trust. Dad always said it is the root of our family. Dani: Then trust me to know that this was a good move for us. Josh: Why, why did God let my dad die? Dani: I don't know, baby. Josh: Later, Mom. I gotta go. Andrea: Hello, ladies! Women: Oh, hello, how are ya? Andrea: This is my cousin, Danielle Singleton. She's new to the city, and she'll be joining our women's group, so everyone accept her with open arms and we're just gonna treat her as part of our family. Women: Hello, hi. * Praise God from whom all blessings flow * Praise Him all creatures here below * Praise Him above the Heavenly hosts * Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost * Praise God from whom all blessings flow * Praise Him all creatures here below * Praise Him above the Heavenly hosts * Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Pastor: As you prepare to leave this holy place, on this Thanksgiving celebration season, we want to remind you that as we go forth from here that in everything we ought to give our God thanks. Thank Him for your salvation, thank Him for your life, health, and strength. Thank Him in the good times and in the bad times. In everything, thank the Lord. Remember on this day, that Jesus who was present at the wedding feast of Cana is here today. And if we stay close to Him, and keep our eyes on Him, we will always be close, one to another. Now unto Him who is able to keep us from falling, and present us faultless before His throne with exceeding joy, be power and dominion forever, let the people of God say Amen. * Lift your voice, lift your voice * And praise Him * Clap your hands, clap your hands * And praise Him * List your voice, lift your voice * And praise Him * Clap your hands, clap your hands * And praise Him * Lift your voice and praise Him * He's been so good * You gotta right * To praise His name * Yeah, yeah Judy: How are Jason's parents? Dani: They're good. They miss him, too. Judy: Aww, who do these adorable children belong to? Dani: Do you remember Karen, my babysitter in Columbus? Judy: When she was just a freshman? Dani: Yep, mm-hmm. She married this nice guy named Ray. Judy: Mm-hmm. Dani: After she got her Masters, they had a son and a daughter, and they even got a dog, livin the dream. Judy: Wow! Aww, how cute! Honey, I know it's been hard since Jason died. I just wish that you and Josh would have come home. Dani: Yeah, Mom, in a perfect world we would have. Judy: I know, I know, I understand. Rev. Allen: You've done well, Danielle, I'm proud of you. Uh, what time will, uh, Josh get home? I thought he was joining us for dinner. Dani: Rehearsal must have gone long, he should be on his way. Rev. Allen: You seem to be puttin every aspect of your life back in order. Now that Jason's gone, when are you gonna tell Josh about his father? Dani: Really, Dad? That was 18 years ago, let it go. Rev. Allen: Yes it has been 18 years. 18 years you've been lyin to your son. Lies, skeletons, they don't stay hidden forever. Dani: Yeah, and- Rev. Allen: They always find a way of coming out of the closet. Dani: Yeah and from what I hear, the Allen family sure has a lot of them. Rev. Allen: Listen Danielle- Dani: I'm tired! Why can't you forgive me? Josh: Family! Sorry I'm late. Dani: Boy, where is your coat? Josh: I'm good, I don't need no coat. Dani: Mm-hmm. Josh: Hey. Judy: Oh, hi, baby. Rev. Allen: Hey, my boy. Judy: How you doin? Rev. Allen: The movie star! I hear you gonna be a big hit. Josh: I hope so. Rev. Allen: How long you been actin boy? You have any plans for New York, Hollywood? Josh: Well you know what? Let me check with my agent. I'm just.. Maybe you should come by for Christmas and see my uh, the production. Judy: Christmas is such a busy time for your grandfather. Rev. Allen: You know, I'd love to son, but I got a job to do in Smithtown. You know, it does my heart good to know that you're involved in ministry though. Judy: Your mom tells me you've made some friends at the church? Josh: Yeah, the youth group makes living in Pittsburgh okay. Rev. Allen: I'm sensing a pretty girl in that answer. Josh: Perhaps there are quite a few of those. Rev. Allen: Anyone special? What's the pretty young lady's name? Josh: Sydney. Rev. Allen: Is she single? Josh: Not anymore. Rev. Allen: So you uh, you like her, but you haven't told her. Josh: Something like that. Rev. Allen: Well son, you're the new kid on the block. Use that to your advantage. Josh: Hey. Dani: Hey! So umm, who's Sydney? Josh: She's just a friend, Mom. And she sings in the choir. Dani: So what do you like about her? Josh: Well, she's, she's nice, and, she's funny. Dani: And she's pretty. Josh: And she's pretty. Dani: What else do you know about her? Josh: Well, she wants to be an actress, but she's going to med school to please her dad or whatever. Uh, she has a little sister and she lives with her mom. Dani: Okay, well, I'd like to meet her. And I'd like to meet her mother. Josh: Uh, Mom, she doesn't even know I like her. Dani: Well, when are you gonna tell her? Josh: Well you'll be the third to know. Dani: Third? Josh: After I tell her, I'm gonna tell Dad, and then I'll tell you. Dani: Hi! Andrea: Hey! Dani: It's good to see you. Hey! Harvey: Happy Thanksgiving! Dani: Happy Thanksgiving! Harvey: Come on ya'll, have a seat. Judy: Hi Precious, how are you? Andrea: Hi! Judy: It's so good to see you! My goodness! Harvey: Reverend Allen, it's nice to finally meet you. Rev. Allen: Good to meet you, son. Andrea: I'm so glad you guys decided to join us. Judy: Oh yes, of course, thank you for inviting us! Harvey: Mrs. Allen, it is my pleasure to make your acquaintance. Judy: I'm very glad to meet you as well. Rev. Allen: How are you? Andrea: Good. Harvey: Come on folks, come have a seat. Judy: Oh, thank you so much! Thank you! Andrea: Aunt Judy, you're looking beautiful, just as I remember. Judy: Aww, thank you, thank you. Rev. Allen: So how's your father? Andrea: He's good, finally takin it easy. He had triple bypass surgery last year. You know how you Allen men are, workaholics. Judy: Is he doing better? Andrea: He doesn't have a choice. Corey: Hi, how are you? Rev. Allen: I'm fine, just fine son. How are you? Corey: I'm good. I'm gonna be the next president of America. Josh: Stop kissing up! Harvey: My family has a tradition. Whenever we come together, we thank God for friends and family. You mind joining us? Father God, we just thank you for another opportunity God, and we just thank you for bringing friends and family together. God, we thank you for getting here safely, and we know that through this experience we're gonna have a great time in you God. We thank you for us gathering together and the blessings in this room. And God, we just ask that you continue to bless these families. God, we just ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus. Amen. Everyone: Amen. Pastor: My friends, when we think about Christmas, this is what motivated God to show up in the world. And tell the angels and the prophets and the apostles to speak this word, and write these words in the gospel gazette. Extra, extra, read all about it, for unto us this day is born a Savior, and He shall save His people from their sins. Why? Because God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son, that whosoever should believe upon Him should not perish, but have eternal life. Somebody knows what I'm talkin about, don't you? My friends as we prepare to close, we want sister Sydney to come, and she's gonna lead us in a beautiful song that might remind us of the power and redeeming grace of our God. Come on, give the Lord a hand clap everybody. Sydney: * Silent Night, Holy Night * Shepherds quake at the sight * Glories streams from Heaven above * Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah * Christ the Savior is born * Christ the Savior is born * Christ the Savior is born Dani: This was so beautiful, I enjoyed the whole entire service, thank you. Sheila: It was. It was a great service. Josh: Mom, this is Sydney. Dani: Hi, Sweetie, it is so nice to meet you. Sydney: Nice to meet you, too. Andrea: Hey, Syd. How are you? Sydney: Hi. Andrea: You really blessed my heart with that song. Sydney: Oh, thank you, praise God. Andrea: Hey, Sheila. Sheila: Hi. Andrea: How are you? Sheila: Good. Andrea: We've missed you at the Women's Ministry meeting. Sheila: I know, and it's exactly where I need to be. I'll be back. Andrea: Alright, alright. Sheila, this is my cousin, Danielle. Dani: Hi! Sheila: Hi. Dani: Nice to meet you, your daughter can sing, girl! Sheila: Oh praise God! She is blessed. Sydney: Mom, this is Josh's mom. Sheila: Oh! Then we need to talk about the Snow Ball. It's right after Christmas. Dani: The Snow Ball? Josh: Oh, oh yeah, Mom, uh, I told Sydney I'd escort her to the Snow Ball. Dani: Mmm, yeah, we're going to have to talk about that, because this would be the first time I'm hearing about it. Sheila: Oh, and this is my youngest, Shae. Dani: It's nice to meet you. Shae: Nice to meet you, too. * Silent Night, Holy Night * All is calm, all is bright * Round yon virgin, mother and child * Holy infant so tender and mild * Sleep in Heavenly peace Jason: Hey lady, it's midnight. Dani: Hey, are you okay, is something the matter? Jason: I'm fine, I'm fine. This is for you. Dani: Oh, okay, okay. okay. This is for you. It's your turn, you open, it's your turn to go first. Jason: Oh Baby, you shouldn't have. Dani: You should have the things you want. Even if it's an overpriced jersey with someone else's name on it. Jason: Now your turn. I'm sorry. It was a stupid thing to get upset about. I should have understood about your fear of seeing Greg at Hershey Park. Can you forgive me? Dani: Yeah, of course. Josh: Merry Christmas! Dani: Oh, Joshua! Josh: I know you and Dad exchanged gifts every Christmas morning. Dani: Oh, Baby, thank you! Josh: I want to make it special for you. Dani: You make it special. Josh: I love you, Mom. Merry Christmas. Dani: I love you. Merry Christmas, Sweetie. Josh: I wish Dad was here. Dani: He is, always. Dani: Your daughters are so beautiful. You must be so proud. Sheila: Well at least I am. There dad hasn't really been involved since the divorce. Sylvester always promises he'll show up- Shae: Then he makes an excuse. But he always sends Syd flowers. Sheila: Shae! Shae: What, he never sent me any flowers. Sorry about that. Dani: It's no problem. Sheila: Well, um, the Snow Ball. Dani: Yes. Sheila: It is the second Friday in February. And for some reason it's always freezing that day. Dani: As long as it doesn't snow, I'm alright. Sheila: Syd's not gonna want me to drive them downtown. Dani: Well Josh doesn't have his Pennsylvania license. Let me check with Harvey. He and Josh have really connected this past summer. Sheila: Okay. Yeah, Syd's gonna want to drive, but I'm not comfortable with that. Between the snow, and ice, and giddiness, and inattentiveness, that's a recipe for disaster. Dani: Yeah, I know that's right. Sheila: And the parking downtown is horrible. Yeah, that would put my mind at ease. Dani: Woo! Look at you! You look so good in this tux, yes! You know the older you get, the more you look like your father. Josh: Oh well, I don't like the shoes. Dani: You look wonderful and handsome. Now, we need to go so that we're not late. Josh: Uncle Harvey isn't comin 'til six fifteen. Dani: We need picture time. * When I first saw your face * It made me act the strangest * Kind of way * When conversations didn't flow * Shae: You know you like him. Sheila: Mom, get your daughter. Shae: Mom, she really does like Josh, she's just too afraid to tell him. Josh: Well you know what? My Uncle's here so... Sydney: Okay, let's go. Dani: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me just take one more picture. Josh: One more, Mom. Sheila: Here, you look beautiful. Sydney: Thank you. Sheila: Want coffee? Dani: So why didn't you go to the Snow Ball? Shae: My mom wouldn't let me. Dani: And why not? Shae: She says I'm too young. Dani: Oh well, maybe next year. Shae: This is Sydney's second year. Last year she went with a teacher. Sheila: Shae! TMI! Shae: It's always about her. The great Sydney Daneen Henderson, she's so perfect. Dani: TMI? Sheila: That's our cue for when she's talkin too much. It's jealousy. Dani: Jealousy? Sheila: It's been brewin for awhile now. She doesn't feel like Sylvester loves her, and she doesn't know how to deal with Syd getting flowers all the time. Dani: What do you mean? Sheila: Well, every time Sylvester sends flowers to Sydney, or calls and talks longer to her than he does to Shae it's a problem. Well, Sylvester called this morning and told Syd he was sending her flowers. He's never even seen Shae dance or play basketball, and he's never sent her flowers. Dani: Have you guys ever talked to anyone about this? Sheila: No. I haven't told anyone about it. It's, it's embarrassing. I mean, I don't even know how to help my own daughter. Dani: Girl, it is not your fault. We do the best we can with our kids. You know they don't come with manuals. Do you want me to talk to her? Sheila: I don't know how she's gonna respond. Dani: Look, how bout I give Shae some time next week. Sheila: I blame myself for staying too long. I should have never went back after the affair. While I was home working like a dog, raising Sydney like I was a single parent, he was off at that hospital practicing several methods of internal medicine with the nurses. He didn't even have the decency to tell me he had a son. I had to find out through whispers at the hospital Christmas party. Dani: Sheila, I am so sorry. Sheila: I wanted my marriage to work, and I wanted Sydney to have her father. I mean, I had my dad. She deserves that, too. Dani: Well, what happened? Sheila: Well, we were separated for a year, and Shae is our reconciliation baby. But when I told him that I was pregnant, he said he wasn't back long enough for the baby to be his. Dani: Do you really think he doubts Shae is his? Sheila: I don't know what he thinks. But I do know it's easier to be distant and to send flowers and a note then to have a relationship with your children. I thought I was marrying my prince when I married him. I just wanted him to love me. Dani: I understand how it feels to think that you've married your prince. I'd still be married to mine if, he hadn't gotten colon cancer and, Sheila: Mmm. Dani: he wouldn't have been taken away from me. Sheila: Tell me about him. Dani: He was everything I would have hoped for. He was everything I dreamed of, he was my fairy tale. Sheila: Mmm. Dani: We were happy, we were in love. He was my prince. Josh: Morning, Mom. Dani: Good morning, good morning. You know, it's been two years, and I still miss him. Josh: Me too. We don't talk about Dad anymore. Dani: Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just, I think about him all the time. I, I, I just don't want you living in the past. I want you to be able to move on. Josh: So, you were listening when we went to see that counselor. Dani: Yeah, yeah. Josh: Yeah well, I mean, I'm movin on, I just don't want to forget. Dani: I could never forget Jason. I'll always love him, he'll always have a special place in my heart. Sheila: Hello? Dani: Hey girl, gettin ready to get on the road. Sheila: Well enjoy your time with your family. Dani: My family is very interesting. I'm sure I'll have lots to tell you. Sheila: Yep, I'm sure. Well enjoy. Dani: Hey Sheila, you know the singles fellowship women's party is tonight. Sheila: Yeah. Dani: Well, I think you should go. Sheila: Well, let's leave that as a maybe. Dani: You both look so happy. It is such a blessing. Stephanie: That's what love does, this man completes me. Joey: I'm just so glad that God gave me Stephanie. I only wish I would have found her sooner. Dani: Okay, okay. Get goin before you miss your flight. It's obvious you both can't wait until this honeymoon get's started. Joey: Cause we got business baby! Noah: Hey baby bro, I was hopin to holler at y'all before you left. Joey: Aww man, I'm just glad you were able to share this moment with us. Tashika: Yeah, I wouldn't miss this for nothin. Stephanie: Hey, it's a pleasure meeting you all. Tashika: Pleasure meeting you as well. Rev. Allen: Son. Tashika: What's up Rev. Hey, Mom. Judy: Hi baby, how you doin? Rev. Allen: Son, I'm proud of you. I'm so glad that you finally decided to come home to the Lord. He can really use your talents today. I just wish it was at home, at my church. Stephanie: Reverend Allen, we'd be happy to visit, and I'm sure Joseph would be honored to play at your revival. Joey: Well thanks, family, we'll give you a call when we get back. Judy: Alright, see you later, bye! Dani: So how was the college tour? That sure is a lot of ground to cover in five days. Josh: I liked Tennessee. Man, they even had a party for us. Dani: Is that the only reason you want to go there? Josh: Mom, of course not. Dani: Okay, so, what other schools did you like? Josh: Mmm, they all were nice, but I liked Tennessee and Hampton the best. Dani: Okay. Could you see yourself going there for four years? Josh: Yeah. Dani: And, you didn't like Morehouse? Josh: Well, since you're makin me go to a school with all boys now, Dani: Yeah I want to make sure I had plenty of girls when I go to college. Dani: Have you considered looking at Ohio State? Josh: Nope, too cold. Dani: I thought you liked Columbus. Josh: I do, I just want to go to a school where it's warm. Dani: Okay, well, have you even started thinking about a major? Josh: Nope. Dani: Josh! Any other schools? Josh: Uh, maybe one or two. Dani: Okay, which ones? Josh: Duke, Georgetown, and Michigan. Dani: Ooh, Michigan! Josh: Mm-hmm. Dani: That's my alma mater. Go blue! Josh: Mm-hmm. Dani: Wait a minute. Aren't those the schools that Syd's considering? Josh: A lot of people are considering them. Dani: Mm-hmm. Syd just happens to be in that group. Dani: Right, okay. Josh, we're running out of time. Josh: Yeah, well it was your idea to transfer me my senior year of high school. I had all this figured out with Ms. Butler at Columbus. Dani: Josh? Josh: Hmm? Dani: Still planning to go to Columbus to take Nikki to the prom? Andrea: It was good seein everyone. I really enjoyed last weekend, I'm glad we went. Dani: I'm just glad everybody behaved themselves. Andrea: I can't believe it's been 22 years since I last saw your brothers. It was good seein people at a wedding instead of a funeral. Dani: Yeah. Well, I'll be getting everybody together again for Josh's graduation. I hope, no I pray, that we can all get together, we can have a good time. I'm thinking about getting a shelter at the park- Harvey: Ladies. We're trying to watch TV. Andrea: Speaking of family, Alicia wants us to come to Raleigh. Josh: Oh, Mom, don't forget about the basketball tournament with my friends at O State. Corey: Oh, I wanna come! Josh: Sorry cuz. High school only. Dani: Girl, guess what. Andrea: What? Dani: Sheila met somebody at the singles fellowship on Saturday. Andrea: Who? Dani: Doug. Andrea: Doug Dani: Um, um, we didn't get that far. Andrea: I don't recall a Doug. Dani: He's a friend of Isaac's. Harvey: So who's a friend of Isaac's? Andrea: This guy Sheila met at the singles fellowship. Uh, the girls don't know. Harvey: Oh, so in other words, don't talk about it? Andrea: You're such a good man. Harvey: Need me to check him out? Dani: Of course, make sure the FBI doesn't know who he is. Andrea: I know that's right. Dani: So, tell me about Doug. When's the last time you talked to him? Sheila: Talked to him this morning on my way to work. Dani: Mmm. And you've told the girls? Sheila: I told them that I had somebody that I wanted them to meet on our way to church yesterday. Dani: And how'd they take it? Sheila: Well Syd, of course, was more than excited. She's been wantin me to date since forever. Shae didn't say much. Dani: Really? How was she when they met? Sheila: She gave him a dry hi, But Syd was very cordial. Dani: Hmm. So um, when do I get to meet this mystery man? Sheila: Well actually, Isaac suggested we go to the movies and dinner together on Saturday. Dani: Ooh, that would be nice. Sheila: No, silly. You and Isaac are coming with us. Dani: Me and Isaac? Sheila: Yes girl, I told you he liked you a long time ago. You've just been actin like the Queen of the Nile. Dani: Okay. Sheila: Dani, are you listenin to me? Dani: Mm-hmm. Sheila: It's okay Dani, we're going out to have a good time. I'm not asking you to marry him! Really, it's okay! Dani: What time on Saturday. Dani: Hey Josh, come here. Sit down for a second, Baby. Josh: Okay. What's up? Dani: I have a question for you. Josh: Okay. Dani: How do you feel about me dating again? Josh: Mmm. Never thought about it. Dani: Okay, well let me ask you this: Do you know Mr. Isaac from church? Josh: Yeah, yeah, I like Mr. Isaac. He's cool, he cool. Dani: Why do you say that? Josh: Well he uh, he came with Salvation Soldiers when we went uh, rock climbing. And uh, and he plays ball with us. Dani: Hmm, really? Josh: Oh, yeah, yeah, he can be funny, too. Yeah, I like him, he's cool. Dani: Okay. Josh: Yeah. Dani: Well, we're just friends and, we're gonna go out and have a nice time. Josh: Well, I want you to have a nice time, Mom. Isaac: So, how long do you think you'll be playing the grieving widow? Dani: I don't know. Isaac: Mmm. I mean, do you think Jason would want you to be alone for the rest of your life? Dani: No. He love me too much for that. Isaac: Mm-hmm. I see why. Dani: Get your feet off my table! What are you still doing up? Josh: Waiting on my mom. Dani: Well we had a nice time. We all did. So did you pack? You know, Sheila will be here in the morning. Josh: Already done. And um, I talked to Grandma, and she said do not forget my senior pictures. Sheila: You gonna be okay? Dani: Yeah, my in-laws are wonderful. I actually need to do a better job of keeping in touch. Sheila: Yeah. What about you, Josh. This must be hard. Josh: I'm okay, I'm just looking forward to seeing everyone. Especially my grandfather. Dani: Got that? Josh: Mm-hmm. Shae: So Ms. Dani, how did your husband die? Dani: He had colon cancer, sweetie. Shae: Is that like breast cancer? Sydney: Cancer is cancer, Shae. Shae: I didn't know, that's why I asked. Sheila: Girls, please. Shae: But Mom! Sheila: But nothing, Shae! Shae: Did you cry? Sheila: Oh my God. Dani: Yes, yes, I cried, I was very sad. I loved him very much. Shae: Did you cry, too? Josh: Never been to Charlotte. Dani: You just don't remember, you came when you were four. Josh: You nervous, Mom? Dani: No, not really. We're here with family. Josh: Well I'm sort of nervous. I just don't want all those people askin me if I'm alright. It's only been two years. Dani: I know, we don't have to go to the reception, you know. Josh: I'm okay, I'm not mad anymore that dad died. I just, I just wish he was alive. Dani: I know, me too. No one will ever take his place in my life. Josh: Not even Mr. Isaac? Dani: Not even Mr. Isaac. If I ever get married again, it will be different, no one will ever replace Jason. Josh: Would I have to call Mr. Isaac Dad, if you married him? Dani: I have no plans on marrying Mr. Isaac, we're just friends. Jason will always be your father, nothing will ever replace that. Josh: I love you, Mom. Dani: I love you too. Now show me how much and go get us a table, save me a seat with your grandparents. Josh: Okay. Josh: Hey! Mr. Singelton: Hey, Josh! How you doing grandson? Josh: Hey, Pap! Mr. Singleton: Good to see you, man! Looking good! Mrs. Singleton: Come hug your grandmother! Where have you been, we have missed you! Josh: Oh, missed you too. Mrs. Singleton: Oh, my dear child! Where's your mother? Josh: Oh, she's gettin ready. Dani: Good morning, Baby. Josh: Good morning. Dani: Good morning. It sure was good seeing everybody last night. Josh: Yeah, you know, I though I'd be sad but um, it, I, I, I was glad we went. Dani: I meant what I said about staying connected. Josh: Mm-hmm. You know, we went to go see Johnson C Smith while we were there. Dani: You know, we have a lot of cousins that attend there. Josh: I finished my online application last night. Dani: Is that for school or for basketball tickets? Josh: For both. Dani: And is it because Syd will be going to Duke? Josh: No, not really, they have rolling admissions. Dani: And, what about majors? Josh: Well, I don't really know what I want to do yet, so it's cool, and there's plenty of family. And, when I want to get away I'll just go to Raleigh and see Aunt Alicia and Uncle Dennis. Dani: Josh, you really need to start taking this picking a school thing seriously. Josh: Look, I, I, I do, okay? Really. I wanna go to Johnson C. Smith. Choir: * Oh magnify, oh magnify, * Oh magnify the Lord with me * Oh magnify, oh magnify, * oh magnify the Lord with me * The word of God says in Psalms 34:1 * I will bless the Lord at all times * His praise shall continually be in my mouth * And down in verse three it says * Oh magnify the Lord with me * and let us exalt His name together * Clap your hands, stand up onto your feet, * oh magnify the Lord with me * Come on let's praise the King of kings * oh magnify the Lord with me Sheila: Hello ladies, it's good to be back. Um, I'm going to read a piece entitled Prostrate. It was there, staring at the tracks of the tears as they pooled beneath my face, that I came to faith, again. See, I had always called upon His name. Was raised singing His praises and raved for His saving grace, but claiming Him as Lord, that was a different thing. I knew He was King of Kings, but letting Him reign over everything? That was hard for me. But there, on that floor, He poured His spirit out upon me, Baptized anew, He knew that renewal was needed, and I heeded, I yielded everything to Him. And in return I received what I could never earn. He lifted my head just high enough to place the crown of loving kindness upon it. He redeemed me from the collision course I was trailing and stopped me from derailing. His mercy forgave my mishandling, and His grace took the wheel and steered me to a place of sweet rest. So yes, my soul will bless the Lord as I now lay here. Grateful and surrendered, prostrate before Christ, rehearsing His wondrous benefits. Face down, on the floor. Thank you. Sydney: * What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and- Josh: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, spice it up, you know what I mean? Josh: Do that thing.

Why can't he just keep one promise? You're so blessed to have a father who loves you. Dad, what happened? I thought you would be there to see me get my award.

Noah: Don't act like you didn't leave after you graduated cause you couldn't wait to get away from him. Tashika: I liked ol' Rev, he was aight. Kind of stiff, but he was aight. Stephanie: I really wish I had the chance to get to know him Tashika: Nobody was good enough for his sons.

Tashika: First of all- Noah: Yo man, what's up with that? Joey: Man, you need to tone, you need to tone your woman down. We're supposed to be here for Mom. Noah: Wife. Judy: Hey! Be quiet, Dani is sleeping. Your father loved all of you, very much. He kept putting off going to the doctor. He knew he was sick, kept sayin he had so much to do. Was gettin difficult for him to breathe and he was just tired all the time. I begged him to see Dr. Baird. Rhonda: We have got to stop meeting like this. First my dad, now your granddad? Judy: He said that he would be home at noon. So we were gonna have lunch. Rhonda: But there's other things to worry about like unanswered questions and things unsaid. Josh: So I'm learning. Judy: When, when he didn't come home for lunch I just, I assumed that he got caught up in his work. Shawn came to get me at one thirty. We went straight to the emergency room. And he was already gone when I got there. He was the only man I'd ever loved. Rhonda: Everyone in Smithtown loved him. I gotta, I gotta go see Dani. Josh: I loved Pap. Judy: He loved you too. He really loved you, Joshua. Dani: Hey! Sheila: Hey, girl! Dani: How are you? Come on in. Sheila: Good, how are you? Dani: I'm good, good. Sheila: I made your favorite, vegetable lasagne. Dani: Oh, yes! Sheila: Mm-hmm. Dani: Well, I'm not gonna say you shouldn't have. Come on in. Sheila: Now you know, I prefer meat in mine. Dani: Well I like vegetables, thank you very much. Dani: You can set it right here. Sheila: Okay. Dani: Thank you. Sheila: Whoa. So, how's your mom? Dani: I'm not sure how she's gonna be now that everybody's gone. Joey and Stephanie don't live too far away from her, and Rhonda lives right down the street. My mom kind of adopted her when her mother passed away. Sheila: How are you? Dani: I'm okay. Rhonda's gonna keep me posted on everything. Sheila: Okay, but really, how are you doing? Isaac: Hey Sheila, where's Dani? Sheila: Come on in. Dani's in the back, she'll be out in a minute. I'm, I'm gonna go. Isaac: Okay. Sheila: Um, take care of my friend. Isaac: Oh, okay. Dani: Where's Josh? Isaac: Sleeping. Dani: Why didn't you wake me? Isaac: I told him that you was really tired. Dani: Hmm, well thank you. I'm glad you're here. Josh: Hey Mom, how are you feeling? Dani: I'm glad to see you. Josh: You must have been tired. Dani: What's the matter? Josh: Nothin. Dani: Yes there is. What's the matter? It is something, and if you don't tell me, we can't deal with it. Josh: It was different, seeing you in Mr. Isaac's arms last night. On our last Christmas, I remember seeing you sleeping with Dad like that. I like Mr. Isaac, and I think he's cool, it just felt weird seeing you with him like that. Dani: Josh, if I had died, do you think your Dad wouldn't have dated anyone else? Josh: I don't know, I guess so. Dani: I would have wanted him to. I would have wanted him to fall in love again. I would have wanted him to be happy. I would have wanted the both of you to be happy. And, I think that's what he wants. I think he wants the both of us to be happy. Josh: I, I, I miss him so much. He should be at my graduation. Dani: What's the matter: You didn't like the movie? Isaac: It's complicated. Dani: You've been somewhere else all afternoon. What's complicated? Isaac: Well, they offered me the VP position at the bank. Dani: That's great! Isaac: In Atlanta. Dani: Atlanta? Isaac: Yeah. Baby, this, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. If it came six months ago, this wouldn't be so hard. Please say somethin. Dani: I mean, I'm happy for you, really. This is something you've always wanted. Isaac: Thanks for the party. Dani: It's the least I can do. Isaac: Never thought I'd be in this place. Not after losing Nia, and my baby. Never thought I'd be in a place of love. Loving you, having this opportunity of a lifetime with this job, Eight years ago, Harvey came into the halfway house where I called home, and he asked who wanted to change their lives. Four of us stood up, I was the last one. I took Harvey's invitation. I started Wednesday night fellowship. I learned about love, forgiveness, and purpose. I surrendered to Christ, and I learned to worship God. When I went home that Thanksgiving, I hugged my mom, and I thanked my dad, for being an example of strength and courage. I called Nia and apologized for not being the man that she needed when her baby died. I promised God that I would serve Him, and I would only ask that He restore me, and help me to realize my purpose. I've been praying for this position, and God has answered. I gotta walk into my destiny. * When I first saw your face, * it made me feel some crazy kind of ways * Butterflies leap inside, * stars light up in my eyes * can you really be mine? * But it feels like a dream to me * it feels like a dream to me Pastor: Beloved as we conclude this service, we want you to know that this is the conclusion of this matter of protecting the seed. That we must teach our seed that committed Christians above all else abandon themselves to the purpose of God. And in light of that, I want to charge you today, to be adults who are promoters of the faith and protectors of the family, generators of all that is good and righteous. If this generation is going to be turned around it's going to take every adult, not only in this church but in this community, to love and care for the kids. So as we go down from this Holy place, we got a charge to keep and a God to glorify. So now under Him, who is able to keep us from falling, present us faultless before His throne with exceeding joy, be glory and power and dominion forever, for we are His people and we can live in this world being glad about that. Let the people of God say Amen. God bless you and Heaven smile upon you. * The joy of the Lord is my strength * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * He gives me joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, * joy, joy, unspeakable joy * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength, * the joy of the Lord is my strength * Sydney: I really thought my dad would come. Sheila: I know, but this is your day. Be happy! Shae: At least he got you flowers. * This joy, the world can't take it away, * This joy, the world didn't give, * and the world can't take it away, away, away, * Oh this joy it's mine, * this joy the world didn't give it * My hope is built, * this joy the world can't take it, * On nothing less, this joy, * the world didn't give it, * On Christ the solid rock I stand, * and the world can't take it away, away, away, * This joy, the world didn't give it, * This joy the world can't take it. * This joy the world didn't give and * the world can't take it away. * Josh: I'll be okay, Mom.

Okay. Dani: You know your dad is proud of you, right? Josh: Yeah. Dani: You know he's watching, right? Josh: Yeah. Dani: Well Miss Shae, it's been a fabulous four days. We must do this again the next time your mother goes out of town. Shae: I don't know about fabulous, but it's been fun. I enjoyed the concert, too, thanks for taking me. Dani: Oh, no problem, Sweetie. You know, your mom is really concerned about you and what you think about Doug. Shae: Yeah, I know. Dani: So Shae: Um, I like him, it's just- Dani: Just what? Shae: If him and Mommy get married, I won't have anybody anymore. Dani: What do you mean? Of course you will! You'll have your mom, you'll have your sisters, you'll have me, we all love you. I mean I love you like you're my very own daughter. I count that as a blessing. Shae: My dad doesn't love me. Dani: Oh, Baby, he loves you. Dani: Honey, who's car is that? Shae: Oh that's my dad's car. Sheila: You can't just stop by when your in town and expect everybody to be happy to see you. Sylvester: Look, I just came to see my kids. What are you so bitter about? You got a house, you got a car, everything's taken care of. Sheila: Oh yeah, don't be fooled. I'm ecstatic that you left, and grateful that you left me with two beautiful girls and not AIDS. You're just a whore with MD behind your name. Sylvester: Come on, I just wanna, I just want to be Dad. Sheila: Oh, so you think you're supposed to be daddy of the year? Sylvester: Not of the year just, you know, the present moment. Hey baby girl, how are you doin? Give me a hug. Dani: Greg? Sheila: You know him? Dani: I, I, I gotta go. I'll call you later. Sheila: Girl, what is going on? You walked out, Sylvester looks like he saw a ghost. Dani: I, I, I never knew his name was Sylvester. He introduced himself as, as Greg. Sheila: Sylvester Gregory Henderson. How do you know him? Dani: I was an intern at Western Psych while, while he was a resident and, we had a summer relationship and- Sheila: You had a what? Dani: or at least I, I thought it was a relationship. He told me he loved me and, and- Sheila: He loved you? Dani: please, and that we were gonna get married. And, but, but when I got pregnant with Josh. Sheila: Wait, when you got, what? Dani: He told me that he was married. I haven't seen him for 19 years since I was three months pregnant. When I married Jason, he adopted Josh. Sheila: So, wait a minute, so Jason, your uh, prince, right? Your, your perfect life? What, what happened to that? Was that a lie, too? Were you even married? Dani: Look, look, Sheila, I'm, I'm sorry. This, this is the secret that I have been hiding for, for years. Sheila: Sylvester is Josh's father. Dani: Yeah. Sheila: So, he's the son that everybody was whispering about at the hospital Christmas party. You're the other woman! You're the reason why my husband wouldn't even look me in the face! It was you! He didn't want me, he wanted you! Dani: I didn't know, I'm sorry! He wanted me to have an abortion, I didn't know- Sheila: This is a, this is a bunch of bull. Dani: I, I didn't, he wanted me to have an abortion. Sheila: He shows up, unannounced, to ruin my evening, and now I find out that my best friend ruined my marriage. You know what? The truth does set you free. But freedom ain't never been free! Dani: No Sheila, Sheila no, I'm sorry! * Speechless about the pain * I feel inside my heart * no where else to turn, * it's time for me to do my part * to be free Andrea: Dani, what happened Dani, what happened? Dani: I saw Greg. Andrea: Where Did he come to your house? Dani: He was at Sheila's. He's her ex-husband. Greg is Sylvester. Andrea: What? Dani: It just doesn't go away, Annie. It doesn't go away. Harvey: Babe, I just talked to Sheila. She told me what's going on. She should be here any second. Andrea: We need to pray when she gets here. Harvey: Let me have your coat. It's gonna be okay. We don't always understand the why's, but understand God is still in control. You gotta believe that. Andrea: We need to pray. Harvey: Let's pray. Father God, if we ever needed you before, we need you now. Father God we need your grace, and your mercy. Father God we need you to have your way in this situation. Father God we need you to just bless, where there is pain, give us peace. Where there is confusion, give us wisdom. Have your will, give us the words to say and the things to do. And Father God we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus. Amen. And Dani, if you need me to go down to Charlotte, I can be there next Saturday. I think this can be hard on Josh and, I think I can help. Sheila: My daughter is devastated. Harvey: Look, God has gifted me to help young men grow into Godly men. I don't know too much about these girl things. Dani: I'm so sorry, this is my fault. Sheila: Syd's in love with Josh. Dani: What? I, I thought they were just friends. Sheila: Josh is on his way to Raleigh to take her to the Homecoming Dance. You need to talk to him. Dani: Secrets, lies, skeletons. Sheila: Yeah, and now my daughter is in love with her brother. Dani: I don't know what to say to my son. Sheila: You need to tell him the truth! Dani: I can't. Andrea: Honey, you have to tell him the truth. Dani: God, where are you? I'm trying to have faith. So what am I supposed to do now? Nana, there's nothin in those wisdom seeds to help me now, nothin. Dani: Hello? Josh: Hey, Mom. Hey, you tracked me down. Mom? Mom, you alright? Dani: Hey. Hey, Baby, how you doin? Josh: I'm, I'm fine, Mom. What's the matter? Dani: Josh, are you sitting down? Josh: Is Nana okay? Dani: Yes, Josh. This is, this is between me and you. Josh: Mom, what are you talkin about? Don't tell me your going to Atlanta to be with Mr. Isaac. Dani: Josh, please listen. Josh: Okay, Mom, what's goin on? Dani: Josh, when I graduated from college, I had an internship at Pitt, and my boyfriend's name was Greg. He told me that he loved me and, when I got pregnant he told me that he was married. And he wanted me to have an abortion but I, I couldn't. Josh: Do I have a, brother or a sister that you gave up for adoption? Dani: No. Josh, that baby is you and, his name is Sylvester Gregory Henderson, Miss Sheila's ex-husband. Josh: What? No, uh-huh, Miss Sheila's ex-husband! Dani: I haven't seen him since I was three months pregnant. I met Jason in grad school when you were one. He adopted you after we got married. Josh: Syd, Syd is not my sister! Dani: Yes Josh, she is. Josh: You, you let me fall in love with my sister, Mom? Mom, you've been lyin to me my whole life! How could you do that! What about love, and trust, and all that stuff? Dani: Josh, Josh, I didn't know. I just found out yesterday! * I feel I can't take it * and it's making me so frustrated * but I trade my weakness on my knees Alicia: Dani, what's going on? I gotta go check on Josh, I'll call you back. Josh! * but I learned how to put my trust in you lately * I had to get to this place * so I could make this plea * I surrender, I surrender Jason: February 14th. My dearest Danielle, As I look back over our lives together, I can only thank God He gave me you, and a wonderful son. I pray you have felt loved, and that Josh has felt loved and nurtured. I hope he always knows I did my best. I know I don't have long, so I will cherish every memory. I only regret that it's much too soon. I also regret not having the chance to sit down with Josh, man to man, and explain the adoption. One day, when he has children of his own, show this letter to him and he'll understand. Well my sweet, if this is my last letter, know that it's sealed with all my hopes and dreams. Love and kisses, forever yours, Jason. Dani: Sheila, I'm so sorry. Sheila: You look a wreck. Dani: Yeah. I'm, I'm really sorry about everything. Sheila: Can we just be honest? I've missed my friend, but I was hurt. I was angry. Dani: No more lies, I promise. Sheila: So many lies in my past. Trust is very important to me. Dani: So, what do we do now? Sheila: Pray our way through this. Dani: Day 19, still haven't heard from Josh. Sheila: Well you'll never guess what Sydney did. Dani: What? Sheila: She called Sylvester and asked him to come down and meet Josh. Dani: Are you serious? Huh, I have got to call Alicia. I've got to get to North Carolina. Sheila: No, we've got to get to North Carolina. Let me tell her to call when he's on his way. Dani, I just got a call from Syd. She's at a hospital in Durham. She's fine, it's not Sydney, it's Sylvester. He was in a car accident. He was in a car accident on 85. Dani, it doesn't look good. He knows, she called him. He's gonna take the first train to Durham in the morning. Alright. Sheila: He's gone. Dani: What do you mean, gone? He's dead? Sheila: Hey girl! Dani: Hey, how are you? Sheila: Good! How are you? Dani: I'm good, I'm good. Where's Josh? Sheila: Now, don't get upset. Dani: Why would I get upset? Sheila: The kids stayed at the house with Sylvester's mother. Dani: Josh, too? Sheila: All of the grandkids. Dani: He doesn't, he doesn't even know them. Sheila: Hmm, well he knows them now. And, they obviously knew about him. He asked me to bring his clothes to the house in the morning. Dani: He hates me. Sheila: He does not hate you. This is a lot for him to deal with. Dani: My dad was right. Skeletons always get tired of hiding. And now mine have come out to haunt me. Sheila: Girl, God is bigger than any skeletons. I'm gonna go take a shower. I'll be back. Pastor: God bless you. God bless you. Although your father is passed away, he will still be with you, in here. Remember him in everything you do, and how you act. That's how you honor his legacy. When people see you, they'll see him. What do you want them to remember? Bless you, bless you. Bless you. Dani: God, I don't feel like you're watching me anymore. And I need you. Please help me. I can't do this. Josh: I'm gonna ride back to the church with Ms. Sheila. I'll see you at the hotel. Dani: Wait. Sheila: I'll call you when I get back to the room. I gotta go do this family thing. Josh: Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This hurts so bad. Why does everyone die? Dani: I'm so, so sorry. I know this hurts. I'm so sorry. Mrs. Henderson: Joshua, is this your mama? Dani: Hi, I'm Danielle Singleton. Mrs. Henderson: Hi. Dani: Hi. Mrs. Henderson: You have every right to be angry. But I would ask you not to. This day is sad enough by itself. I was hoping that tomorrow we could all start over, with a new day. I'm hoping that you would join the family for dinner, so we could talk. Mr. Henderson: I only had one son. And now he's gone. I'd like to get to know you and Joshua better. Dani: Look, here's my number. I would love the opportunity to get together, but right now, I just need to be with my son. Latoya: Hey. Dani: Hi. Latoya: I'm, I'm Latoya. This is my husband Julian, Julian: How you doing? Dani: Hi. Latoya: and my son Brandon. I know my brother, you know, was a jerk, but once everything calms down hopefully we can sit down and talk. Dani: Sure. Latoya: Josh seems like a fine, young man. And I'm sure he'd love to get to know his cousin. Tomyra: Hi, I'm Mrs. Tomyra Henderson, and this is my son Sylvester, Junior. I would love for my son to get to know his brother, if that's alright with you. Josh has my number, and you can find me on Facebook. Tomyra Henderson. Josh: Mom. Why didn't you tell me? Dani: I was young and gullible when I met Greg, I mean Sylvester. You know, I really thought that he loved me. I was devastated when he left me after I got pregnant. Josh: You, you both should have told me when I was old enough to understand. Dani: Well, Jason wanted to when you were 10. But, I begged him not to. Josh: Sylvester ever want to see me? Dani: He never called. Josh: Would you have let him? Dani: I don't know. I guess. Josh: So, now what? Dani: Thanks. I wish I had the answers. Josh: Mm, thank you. Dani: We're gonna need to talk to someone. Josh: Another counselor? Dani: I'll look for a family therapist. Maybe we can get two or three sessions in when you're home for Christmas. Josh: Syd should come, too. Dani: I'll talk to Sheila about it tomorrow. Josh: I'm really sorry that Mr. Isaac had to take that job in Atlanta. Dani: Me too. * Jesus, Jesus, how I proved * Him o're and o're Dani: Thank you Lord for everything. Thank you for keeping me sane when I thought I was losing my mind. Thank you for loving me when I didn't even like myself. Thank you for Grandma Ida and Jason, and Josh. Thank you for my friends and my family. All those people who love and care for me so much. No more weights, no more lies, no more secrets. Dani and First Lady: * Oh for grace - oh for grace * Oh for grace - oh for grace * Oh for grace - oh for grace * Oh for grace - oh for grace * To trust Him more * To trust Him more Dani: Hallelujah, hallelujah! I've lived with this, with this skeleton and um, this skeleton decided it was going to come out of, out of it's closet, and it's hurt so many of the people that I've that I love and I care about. I, I didn't know the difference between love and lust, I really, really thought that he loved me. I thought we were gonna get married, I thought we were going to ride off into this beautiful sunset and we were gonna live happily ever after. But he, he proved me wrong when I got pregnant with Josh. And he left me. My pregnancy shamed my father. He was so ashamed of me. But when I married Jason, Jason adopted Josh and so I took my shame and I shoved it into a closet. Jason begged me to tell Josh, but I refused. My secret was the way of making it right. A few weeks ago, Josh's father showed up. And you know, the world, it's so small. Because Josh's father was Sheila's ex-husband, and I hurt my son, I hurt my best friend, I hurt her kids with my secret, but what I know is that my God is a God of forgiveness. And He's a God of redemption, and He's a healer and, I thank Him for loving me, and I thank Him for restoring me. Sydney: * I surrender all, I surrender all Sydney: * I surrender all, I surrender all * All to thee my blessed Savior * I surrender all Josh: I knew I'd find you here. Sydney: When did you get home? Josh: Yesterday. Sydney: Me too. Josh: How are you? Sydney: I, I don't know. This is just crazy. Josh: I'm sorry. Sydney: I wanted to tell you how I really felt when you came for Homecoming. But the call from my mom was just too crazy. It blew me away. Josh: I'm glad I didn't kiss you that day on the porch. Sydney: I just wish you could have met my dad. Well, our dad. Josh: Yeah, I had a lot of questions. Sydney: He wasn't so bad. Josh: So now what? Sydney: I guess we start over. Josh: As brother and sister? Sydney: And we ask God to help us and heal our pain. Josh: I miss dad. Dani: Me too. This was our favorite holiday. Josh: I wanted to meet Sylvester. Dani: I'm sorry. Josh: It hurts but, it's different. I have so many questions. Dani: I understand. It's hard when someone dies and you have so many unanswered questions. Josh: Like you and granddad? Dani: I never wanted you to know that pain. Josh: I wish he was here so I could tell him that I know the truth and nothing changes. He is my father and I love him. Dani: You up for a drive? Josh: Where? Dani: Columbus. Josh: You made me promise to take care of Mom and I will. I will always love her forever, enough for the both of us. Mom, did you always cry so much? Dani: Yeah but these are happy tears. If you ever find yourself bound up in a mess, seek God, and He will set you free. Josh: What? What did you say Mom? Dani: It's one of those wisdom seeds your grandmother planted in me a long time ago when I was young. I finally understand it's significance. I also understand what she meant when she said that God sees the sparrow when it falls. For if He's watching the sparrow, then He's definitely watching me. Come on, I'll explain it all to you in the car on the way home.
