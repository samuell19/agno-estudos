Yes, incredible. Who's that behind you? Mariam! Your father sent you to find a doctor and you brought back a guy from Lyd? As if you're any better... -Sweetheart... -Go away. Kareem, dinner is ready. Okay. You're coming to your parents' concert tonight, right? I can't be bothered to face my dad, so. I'll get back to you later? Okay, fine. Bye. Kareem... Why are you eating all by yourself? Bring down some food, and I'll treat you for a special dessert. I gotta go. Sit down. Finish your dinner. I'm full. No, you're not. Your mother worked hard. Show some respect, eat. Is it tuned? Peace be upon you The land of my ancestors Kareem! Kareem... Salvation at last. Man! Sorry. You kept me hanging. You know what your problem is? You act like a gangster, and your life is full of drama. But you don't leave the house without permission from your mama! What's up? Where to? Come on! We're going to have some fun. Who's driving? Yousef? -All good? -Just a second. Everything cool? I got you a badass Mercedes to show off. Fuck your Mercedes! Why did you bring him? Why did you bring him, man? -Should I send him home? -Yes. -I can't do that. -You want trouble from the authorities? Relax, man. I don't have a car. How am I supposed to find a ride at the last minute? -We're going to have fun. -It's not my problem! -What? -Stop that, come here! Aren't you late for the concert? He calls himself a man, but he doesn't go to college... That's fine. He gets fired from all his new jobs. That's fine too. He claims to be a musician, but I've never seen him practice. That's also fine. But to hang out with drug dealers and thugs, here I draw the line. Let's go. Talal is not a dealer. Give him a week and he'll open a dealing station... Come on! Move faster! Who's that guy in the Mercedes? Don't tell me it's the Imam... What do you know? Don't be rude to your father. Talk with respect! He started it. Why did you... Why did you call me, Dad? Because I'm exhausted and want you to drive us back from the concert. You know you're only making it worse, right? I know. And now, allow me to invite to the stage... From Lyd and for Lyd... Tayseera and Mounir Awad. Good evening, comrades. We'll stand strong and things will get better, right? Peace be upon you The land of my ancestors Where I find pleasure In my home and song Is there another bottle? We'll get more, don't worry. -We'll stop at the store... -Pour me all that's left. Idiot. He's got the prettiest girl in the country. -But look where he ended up. -With us in the brothel! Hey! Mad respect, bless your words... But mention my girlfriend again and I'll fuck your mom! Isn't that what the Jewish bitches are for? Anyone else wants to doubt my talent? -Talal. -What? How much? 200 an hour? No, it's 150. Ask your friend for me. The girl I reserved for you today... She's hot. Sergey! What's up? Sweetie... What's up? Go. Just a second... One second. Where are you, love? Your parents are amazing on stage. At least I got laid, unlike Kareem. He got fucked! Guys, leave Kareem alone. Because Kareem is a hopeless romantic. "Look at her text message... Wow!" What is it, my love? Tired? I'm okay. Kareem. -What? -What. What happened? My mom is going to live... My dad died. Bless his soul. Where is Hussam? Not here. At the funeral home. Pardon us... There is no God but Allah. No slumber can seize him. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. We come from God and to God we shall return. Patience is a form of faith and its reward is great. Patience is derived from faith. The Prophet Muhammad says there is no greater gift than patience. There is no greater gift... God have mercy on our dead, and on our living, and on our young and old. God, do not withhold your blessings. Prevent us from quarreling. Say your goodbyes. Kiss him on the forehead. I'm sorry, Dad. God have mercy on your soul, Dad. Be strong. May God have mercy on his soul.

I would like to invite to the stage... The best singer in the Middle East... Nah, I think it's time to cut the cake. Happy birthday. I'm sick of amateur shows and birthday parties. We deserve better. Even the mosque has a better sound system. Talal sells to weed to Jewish guys... At the Marley Club in Tel Aviv. People rap there. Kareem, maybe they'll let us perform? We sing in Arabic... They won't understand. Don't you worry. With what Talal will sell... Even Hebrew they won't understand. Should I call and ask him? I don't know... Call him. Call him. Ladies! What's up? Come kiss the hand of your new manager. How come? You arranged a performance? Don't believe it? Trust me! You bastard! Don't make me regret this, okay? -You're afraid we'll embarrass you? -Maybe. You're the one who is embarrassing. My income is on the line. Hear that? Don't make me regret this. He's afraid we're going to embarrass him... Respect, man. Now help us clean up... What's that? What? -It's the same one. -Yeah, the same one. Tell me something... Did you buy medicine with my mom yesterday? Yeah. Why do you ask? No reason. How are you? Fine. I registered for next semester... The family is pressuring my mom. They don't want me living alone... Just like Michael Jackson. Yeah, a bit too much. Try this one on. So it's a new semester... And... They want me to get married. That way I'll be someone else's responsibility, not theirs. What do you think? Honestly? I'm glad I don't have a sister to be responsible for. I'm being serious now. You don't want a problem like me? Manar, we talked about this. I have no income, no job, nothing. If I make it big, we can live off the music... Okay? Do you want to sing with us tonight at the Marley? In Hebrew? In Hebrew, yes. Go perform for the Jews by yourself. My love, I didn't mean it... I was kidding, come. Kareem. My cousins are here. So... Jews, cousins, family... All the same shit, huh? Not funny! Now for real, Kareem. I can't have my cousins following me around. Anyway... I'll go with you to the club today. Hey! We can sing that song... I said I'll come, I didn't say I'll sing. Okay, thanks. Try this one... Like that... Everyone put your hands up. RPG. 67 Carat. Sing with us. Everybody sing with us... Long live the nation of Israel! Long live the nation of Israel!

Long live the nation of Israel! Thank you for coming, everyone! You are our family! You are our blood! Wake up... Get crazy... Lose your mind... Wake up... Here comes the guy from Lod, who will keep you wanting more... Kareem! Hello. First, a little explanation. We are going to perform a song called "Burn it, George." In Arabic the title is a... code name. Lod has one of the biggest drug markets in the Middle East. When there's a police raid, that's how the lookout says... Burn the evidence. So when I shout something, you answer... Burn it, George! Hussam! Hear the sirens... Burn it, George! See the sirens... Burn it, George! What did we do? Burn it, George! Don't want no trouble Better pull over! Hands up... Burn it, George! Empty your pockets... Burn it, George! Spread your legs... Burn it, George! I have no record, you can look it up! Call it Lyd, Lod, or Lydia I'll give you a couple of minutes to search in Wikipedia Time's up The police are at the door We live next to the train tracks... 300 trains at the door! The only entrance Is between passing trains Ten kids have died already And there is no one to complain to... A population of 8500 in a ghetto Tighter than a pussy So go to hell before you Tell me to go to school! Have you seen our school? Did you see a library there? They turned it into a police station The only light we see Is the siren Every time I say "Mic check, Record" The cops pull me over to check my record! Hear the sirens... Burn it, George! See the sirens... Burn it, George! What did we do? Burn it, George! I don't want no trouble Better pull over! Hands up... Burn it, George! Empty your pockets... Burn it, George! Spread your legs... Burn it, George! I have no record You can look it up! What is this joke... Where did you find him? -Great show, awesome vibes. -You enjoyed it? Kareem is a great stage name. No, it's my real name. -Where are you guys really from? -Lod. -Which Lod? Jaffa? -Lod. Near the airport... -What's your name? -RPG. I mean the name on your ID... R-P-G. -Seriously? -Yes. -Kalashnikov? -Formerly Kalashnikov... This is 67 Carat, bro. Show some respect. Of course! Great show... -Did you invite... -Yes, you're invited to our after-party. It's gonna get wild and messy... Do you have another card? Come, it's at the loft next door. -Seriously, bro? -I'm serious. Beer? Two beers, please. Shots on the house. Whiskey? You were amazing. Not only a concert, but also whiskey! Excuse me? Cheers! I'm a researcher at the morning TV show. Or do you not know it? You look like night owls, like you love to party and wake up late. I'm Tali. It's a pleasure. I'm Kareem. I'm Amir. Can I have your phone number, Kareem? Unless you don't want to be on our show. No, I didn't say that. Great. Can I have your number? I have two friends with me. They can see you on TV. We want only you. -Why? -Because I like you. -Is this your band? -Yes. -Are you an Israeli Arab rapper? -Kind of... Come, drink. It's on the house, right? -What are you? -What? -Are you shy? -No... -Are you gay? -No way, you're gay. -Are you interested? -In what? In me. Yes, somehow... You're the prettiest here. The sexiest. You are my sunrise... My moon... But I have a girlfriend. You're weird. I have a friend who is stationed at Qalandia checkpoint. They have to check everyone going in and out of the checkpoint. What can he do? An order is an order. Anyone causing problems, gets pulled to the side. Once... there was this old Palestinian man with his grandson. A real Palestinian, not like you. The real deal, from the West Bank. It was a hot day. A bit boring. So the guys wanted to pass the time, play a little game. They asked the old man to run from where he stood to the guard tower in 30 seconds. It's not a problem. A very easy task. He did it in 45 seconds. So they asked him to do it again, but to try harder. And he looked fit. A construction worker or something. But no! He's not willing to cooperate. He sits on the ground and doesn't want to move. As if he was protesting. My friend was nice to him, he asked him to stand up. Because protesting is not a good thing to do. It's not a good thing. Suddenly his grandson becomes weirdly emotional, and decides to attack my friend from behind. So they had to teach the son of a bitch a lesson. And now he is rotting in jail on charge of assaulting a soldier. And I think to myself... What a shame. All the old man had to do was stand on his feet. Really... Cheers. Loosen up. Welcome to the Middle East, my brother. To art, yes? Did you see the one that I was dancing with? If you would have let me, I could have taken her home. You ruined it. You wanted to leave. But you know what? Bros before hos! I wouldn't sell my bros for all the pussies in the world. Just so you know... The only pussies at this party were us. Take it easy, Talal. What is that over there? Motherfuckers! -An eviction order? -Yeah. Talal, what is it, an invitation to another party? Shut up! Another eviction order? Yes. Those motherfuckers... -Easy. -Open the door. Move the bag out of the way. Those motherfuckers... Fuck their democracy! Fuck those assholes... Get out, you. Lower your voice! They're sleeping! Move. Go. -Come on. -We should put Amir with the goats. Every time he drinks, we need to babysit him. Lower your voice! "The Museum of Coexistence" -Coexistence, eh? -Sit down. Don't let it bother you. All I want is a joint to blow my mind. I don't care anymore. Fuck it. By the time they build their museum, I'll be coexisting with a Romanian chick. Blue eyes... Smoking weed, making babies in the snow. I swear. In the middle of the snow. That's a 9 mm. Fuck, you're so stupid. It's fireworks. I swear it's a 9 mm. I assure you that it's fireworks. I told you so. Fuck off bitch! It's actually the sound of the slap that chick gave me. Go to sleep already! Dumbass. Roll us a joint and let us smoke. Let the frustration go. Yes. Yo. What do you want? Manar! What is it Kareem? Did you have fun yesterday? They apologized for '67 and for '48... They also gave us the right of return. You should've been there. It was a historic moment. It's not funny. Manar... You're the one who ditched me. I tried to follow you. Sorry, my love. I'm really sorry. Talal! Good morning. Come eat breakfast. Give it to me, I'll take it. We're missing a hookah. Put that away, my dad's here. -The lawyer will be here soon. -Okay. -Get ready. -No problem. Good morning, Abu Abdullah. Good morning, guys. Welcome. My only work is managing you guys, and it's not even an actual job. You think it's funny? It's not real work. How can you cut me a percent of no profit? How much is twenty percent of zero? Better than nothing. -Hello. -Hello, welcome. -I'm the lawyer from Adala organization. -Abu Abdullah. -Nice to meet you. -Welcome. Talal! Talal! What? The lawyer is here. Coming. I promise to help you to resolve this case. Talal, give her the money, son. No, not now. We'll take only what is needed for the appeal. Look, I'm going to be frank with you. The situation is not looking good. The evidence that the state has provided, according to its own laws, is very strong. Thank you. If you flee the country, the state considers your house abandoned property, and it sells it to the Jewish National Fund. Why to the Jewish National Fund? Because it sells and rents only to Jews... They are claiming that you fled to Jordan in 1948? -We didn't flee, they kicked us out! -I know. There was a massacre in the Dahmash mosque, next to our home, they told us that we are next. -That's when you fled to Jordan? -It was our only option. -How did you manage to return? -My family stayed there. I was the youngest boy. I snuck back here to take care of the goats. According to the state of Israel, your presence here is illegal. -A present absentee. -What do you mean? How can I be absent when I'm right here in my own home? Just a moment. You said that the goats stayed here? Yes. They are here to this day. The goats might be our last chance to win this. When I came back here, everything was destroyed, except for the big house. They put a fence around it. With signs in Arabic, Hebrew, and English that said, "Archaeological Site." There was an opening in the fence. I got in. I found the goats inside the house. I started rebuilding in the yard... 60 years ago. I've been here for over 60 years. I didn't arrive yesterday. But two years ago, they told us that they want the house. In order to build a Museum of Coexistence. To show that there is co-existence between Jews and Arabs, Ethiopians and Russians, Bedouins and whoever else. That is why I have to evacuate the house for demolition. This house is mine. I have the papers to prove it. They laughed... They said to me, "Maybe it belongs to the goats, but it's not yours." -Hopefully it all works out. -I hope so. It's crucial to organize demonstrations for support. Mom, did you take anything? God... Those who are proud will not be humiliated. Those who are guided will not go astray. God... Do you know where the big boss is? Can you tell him that I'll be late tomorrow? Sure. -Want to know why? -Not really. -It's actually a good reason. -Really? Good luck. -Bye. -Bye. And now we will move to Kareem Avid-- Awad. Sorry, it's Awad. The first Israeli Arab rapper... What a celebrity! My songs are not political, they just describe the place I come from. It's like he's been doing this his whole life. You come from Lod, which ironically, is a city most Israelis don't know. Why do you think that is? Lyd is a tough place, especially on our side. I'm talking about poverty, neglected schools, about settlers, police brutality towards us. Police corruption... We live 15 kilometers from fucking... Sorry, I can say "fucking," right? Funny guy. I'm not trying to be funny. I'm trying to say is that you don't know we exist. You said you're not political. I'm not political. But does it make sense to you that to build a Museum of Coexistence they have to demolish my friend's home? I swear he's the man! He shouldn't have mentioned the house. It will open the door for evil. I couldn't help myself. Every other word was "fucking". -Manar, don't give me that look. -What look? TV made me sexy. -I liked what you did. -Thanks, Fayza, sweetie. -I'm coming to the party tonight. -You won't run away? I'll tell you if I do. Push it! Come on. Mom, you have to come to our show tonight. We are late, let's move. I'll take her. Where the heck are we? A Jewish family's house? -Welcome. -Hi, how are you? -No need. -Welcome. Please come in. Let's go inside. Boys, wait for me outside. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, I bear witness that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is his messenger. In the name of Allah Seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, The Creator of mankind, The God of mankind... My mom totally lost it. I don't know, Kareem, I was inside there, and I saw your mom do something incredible. Come on. Repeat after me! Kareem, Kareem! The people want you! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Kareem! Marley, are you ready? Humus, salad, fries on the side You like to eat at our restaurants But when you see too many of us Coexistence turns into A demographic threat I am not political I am not political I am not political I am not political I am not political I am not political Barbarian Arabs Indian Arabs Stinking Arabs -Look at his girl. -The one in black? That bitch? I thought she was Jewish. I sing in Arabic to fight you, racism But you don't play Arabic on your radio What is he singing about? What, you don't speak Hebrew? You know, you don't look like an Arab. You look like a girl who sucks Arab dick. Hey! Stop! Darling, come up here. Manar! I have no place I have no land I have no country I light fire with my fingers I sing to you from my heart The strings of my heart cry out I was born in Palestine I was born in Palestine... Respect. My honest respect. But I want to remind you of one thing. These guys can go to Mumbai, to Dubai to Iran, to Japan. This here belongs to us! This is Israel. This is for Jews. This is Tel Aviv. This is ours! Look at what she's wearing, look at her necklace... This is not the Israeli flag, this is the Palestinian... What is this tape... Hold on... Enough, it's good. -I'll wrap it for you every day. -My love. You were amazing today. That much? Maybe I was exaggerating... Let's exaggerate more... Why? Because you're all talk. I crossed your line. A little bit. You have a Che Guevara poster, you talk about revolution... Yet you won't cross this line. It hurts me. It hurts a little bit. Please. I'm going to make tea. So tea is better than sex? Do you promise me that? Why be an asshole? Who is it? Hello. Is your mother here? You we worship, from You we ask for help. Guide us in the right path, the path of the blessed, not the path of the misguided. Amen. If you come back again, I might be able to help you. You have enemies. There are people who hate you. Who? People. You did something to them. -They are coming after you. -They put a spell on you. This cough is the work of a demon. The doctors don't understand. There is darkness inside of you! You have to come back, so I can help you. It's my duty to help all people. I don't believe in this nonsense. Believe it or don't. It's your choice. You really asked him if he has enemies? Do you know who he is? A human being. Just like the rest of us. Remember what Dad used to say about him? How he told me to stay away? Remember how you never listened? I never listened to Dad? Mom, I listened. You're the one who brought him into our home. I talk to your dad everyday. And he agrees. Here we go again. Listen... Do you even hear yourself? You are helping a drug dealer. Help? I thought you didn't believe in this nonsense. Listen to me. You see angels. You hallucinate. Do what you want. But Yousef will not enter this house. Period! Kareem! They're demolishing Talal's house! Run! We have to get inside! It's our friend's house! Leave me alone! I left something important inside. I need it. -You had enough time. -I wasn't here, good sir, I was at work. Have mercy on the pigeons. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Fine! Give us a second. Just a second! Just let it go. Yousef will never let it go! Officer, it will only take a second. Down with this criminal government! Kareem! Take this. Pull! One, two... Rubber bullets! Down with... My leg, you son of a bitch! My leg! Hussam! I hope Talal's family is all right. Hello. How are you, dear? Thank God you are safe. -Mariam! Bye, dear. -Bye. -Where did they shoot you, son? -Here, nothing serious. They wanted names of activists who were in the demonstration and who organized it. They threatened to hurt my family, to put me in jail again. I told them that I'm familiar with the law. They can't jail me for more than one night. Okay, then... Shall we go? Take care of yourself. Another day in paradise. Welcome to the club, my love. Kareem, my arm... -What? -It still hurts. I'm sorry. I was worried about you. Really? I want you in my life. What's up? Should I build you a room in there? Come with me, let's go. -Where to? -It's a surprise. What surprise? A surprise.

God bless him, my love. Yousef, that son of a bitch... What's important is that you are all right. Let's go upstairs and calm down. Okay. Let's go upstairs. You need to keep it together, okay? There is always this thing pulling me down. I know how much you loved him. But you need to continue singing, for him. Ladies and gentlemen. Your votes please. Number one... -How's this? -No. No? Bollywood, no. Next! -Number three. -This one is pretty. Bring it over here. Congrats. We made a good choice. You like it? -Thank you, man. -Cool one, right? You nailed it! Okay, we have the poster. And now... It's time for sound. Manar. Ready, Kareem? -Should I hold it for you? -No need, I know it by heart. Manar, it's just the guitar for now. Okay? Let us go as we are A free lover And her poet Let us go together On two different paths Let us go as we are United And separate Let us go together And let us... Be kind Give me drums. Three... Two... One. If only I could write you A song of clichés But it's the one thing I can't do I want to imagine us Kissing in the rain But rain is trauma It's a leaking roof I place pots in all the corners Water floods the house I hide my love songs in the drawer I'll read them After my problems are solved Now I am standing wet On your doorstep Pull me out of the street Cover me with your clothes I'm afraid to stand weak in front of you Exorcise out of me the demon of poverty The demon of oppression The feeling that there is no tomorrow Exorcise out of me the demon of drugs The loans to the banks And hug me like there is no tomorrow If only I could write you of my love I sing against the wall But am building another wall between us If only I could write you of my love If only Is here good? Just like that. Do you understand what's going on? Half a million Internet downloads. And we haven't even started! This is the first poster we hang! We should cover it all. Let us go as we are A free lover And her poet Let us go together On two different paths Let us go as we are United And separate Let us go together And let us be kind Manar's voice fits perfectly... Hello. Hello, Kareem. It's Sami, Manar's cousin. Hello, Sami, what's up? We want to ask you for a favor. We'll appreciate it if you can help. We saw the posters for your concert. We don't like that Manar is in them. You know our family. It will bring us shame. We'd like you to forbid her from performing. Sami, please! It's the 21st century. What's wrong with you? Don't disrespect our family. I'm not arguing with you. But we aren't doing anything wrong. It's not up for debate. This girl has no boundaries. Look, let's talk face to face. This is an emergency. We can't do this over the phone. Where are you? Can I turn on the radio? Should I rap? To break the ice... No need. We're about to arrive. Sirens... Burn it, George Hello. Hello. God bless your father's soul. He was a dear friend of ours. But it seems he didn't raise you according to our traditions. My father wasn't... He wasn't that type. We are a traditional family. Manar's performance will bring us shame. And if that happens... We'll be forced to use other means with her. -What means? I don't get it. -Our own means. Pardon us, uncle. I want to speak with him in private. We are tired of reasoning with Manar. I'm talking to you man to man. Men understand each other. Don't make us hurt Manar. We love her very much. Don't upset us, okay? Mom, give us a minute. I want to listen. It doesn't concern you. It does concern me. You are my son. I just want to listen. I won't interfere. Kareem, let her. I met your cousins. They mean business. They said that if I let you perform, then they might hurt you. It's my decision, not yours or my cousins'. I'm going on stage as we agreed. Manar, you are not listening... She's right. It's her decision, no one else's. -Didn't you say you won't intervene? -I lied. I didn't ask for your opinion... I gave it a lot of thinking. And I can't put her in any risk. I can't let Manar on stage. Period. Who are you to decide whether Manar goes on stage? Because I was kidnapped. Not you, not her. Me. You weren't forced into the car. -They threatened me. -With what? That they might hurt you! But you hurting me is better? Me hurting you? I'm trying to protect you, Manar. What about me? Don't I have a say? This is for your own good. You're a coward. And I'll never sing with you again. Manar. Manar! Manar... Answer, my love. I'm not going to stop calling. So? Reading in the dark? You used to warn us about reading in the dark. I read and write in the dark. This light is only to keep me awake. So? Everything all right? Pray for me, Mom. Come. May God protect you, son. And reward you. And keep you from trouble. And give you wealth and heirs. And open the doors of heaven for you. God, make his choices the right ones. May God show you the right path, son. May God show you the right path. That's a .22 caliber... It's a 9 mm. You think I'm crazy. But I know things that you will never know. -What do you think, Amir? -Wow! -Is it okay? -Very much! Hey... You asked me to come and here I am. Thanks, Mom. Now it's my turn to ask you for something. Call Manar. Ask her to come. Darling, the place is full and there is a microphone with your name on it. If only I could write you of my love I sing against the wall But am building another wall between us If only I could write you of my love If only If only I could write you A song of clichés But it's the one thing I can't do I want to imagine us kissing in the rain But rain is trauma It's a leaking roof I place pots in all the corners The water floods the house I hide my love songs in the drawer I'll read them After my problems are solved Now I am standing wet On your doorstep Pull me out of the street Cover me with your clothes I'm afraid to stand weak in front of you Exorcise out of me the demon of poverty The demon of oppression The feeling that there is no tomorrow Exorcise out of me the demon of drugs The loans to the banks And hug me like there is no tomorrow If only I could write you of my love I sing against the wall But am building another wall between us If only I could write you of my love If only Mahmoud Darwish wrote that We'll become a nation When the poet will describe The female body I say, we'll become a nation When the female poet Will describe the male body I write against the siege on Gaza Against those who brought us darkness I write for the camps And meanwhile The love song is a refugee In my drawer I am a refugee on your doorstep Teach me that oppression Is a border, not a subject Take off my clothes, I am ready To stand naked in front of you Create in me the demon of wisdom The demon of trust So I won't fear of you, nor for you Create in me the demon of passion The demon of revolution I will fight for both freedom and love Let us go as we are A free lover And her poet Let us go together On two different paths Let us go as we are United And separate Let us go together And let us be kind
