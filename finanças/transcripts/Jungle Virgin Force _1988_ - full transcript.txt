(upbeat music) (woman yelling) (upbeat music) (water rushing) (girls laughing) - [Narrator] In Southeast Asia there are vast unexplored jungle areas inhabited by native tribes whose lives are untouched by civilization. And on one small uncharted island there dwells a tribe so isolated that it has never made contact with other jungle tribes of that region. Their language is so ancient it cannot be understood by any other people of the world. Their lives are primitive and they worship gods and powers long forgotten by the rest of mankind. In recent years there have been many stories told among these tribes people about a mysterious woman of the deep jungle whom many claim to have see from time to time. There are many debates about the mystery woman. Is she an intruding menace who should be hunted down and destroyed, or could she be a goddess come to bless her people with her protective presence among them? (girls laughing) (dramatic music) (woman yelling) The mysterious woman has heard and responds to the cries for help. (dramatic music) The grateful women gather to thank their benefactor then suddenly they all pause and stand awe stricken by the sight of a strange medallion she wears. Although neither understands the other's language the mysterious woman conveys to the native women that her name is Jelita and that she is their friend. (speaking in foreign language) (drums beating) (tribal chanting) (grunting) (punches landing) (baby crying) (all shouting at once) (woman screams) (suspenseful music) - The distance between the jungle and the city doesn't seem far when one considers that amidst the canyons of mighty concrete skyscrapers the same barbaric behavior still exists. Just as the primitive tribes do, we honor our warriors more highly than our peacemakers. Nevertheless when civilized man enters the primitive environment he must not underestimate the dangers he'll face. Think it over, your expedition could very well be fatal. You'll be encountering real savages who don't comprehend the concept of mercy. You won't find this island on any map in existence, it's uncharted and unexplored, it lies roughly midway between Austria and New Guinea in an area known as the triangle of death. This may sound melodramatic but only a handful of explorers who have gone there have lived to tell the story. I befriended their Queen and with her help I got out alive, the rest of my men weren't so lucky. Their High Priest encourages the practice of cannibalism. His black magic is something you must take seriously. His powers are quite real. Your guide will be a hunter named Bunyan who has spent over 10 years searching those jungles for his daughter who was lost in a plane crash. And one final thing, I implore you to forget about any stories you may have heard about tribal treasures, don't invite your own death. There is no way to emphasize this too strongly forget about the treasure. - Professor? - Excuse me Hydar, Professor would it be possible for you to draw us some sort of a map to the tribal treasure? - I believe what John means is if it's so dangerous we should know where it is so we can avoid it. - Precisely, I don't want to be rich, do you? - John don't make jokes about this. I don't approve of this expedition at all as you all know, I agreed to help for one reason. I don't want any of your deaths on my conscience. Just remember I tried to talk you out of it. - Professor, you will make your maps of the island available to us won't you? - Only if you promise to keep the island's location a secret. Anyway even with a map you won't be able to find your way through those jungles without the help of Mr. Bunyan. I hope you all know your lives are in his hands. (camera clicks) I'll pray for you. And remember this John, none of this is worth risking your life for. - We'll be careful sir. (camera clicks) (calm music) I'm gonna be rich. I'm gonna be a millionaire. And I'm gonna buy you anything you want. But you have to be faithful to me all the time I'm gone. - Please be careful. You sure about the money? - Yeah, while everybody else is busy with their scientific studies I'm gonna grab that treasure. - But it's dangerous. - Don't worry your pretty little head. I always take care of number one, so don't worry okay. - [Woman] Oh god. - You were right Doris. They're getting the treasure map from that professor. We better hurry 'cause the expedition is planning to leave tomorrow morning. Piet do you think you could persuade the professor to hand over his pretty map to us? - That'll be easy. - Piece of cake. Piet. - Stop it, leave him alone. No! - That's just a sample of what you're gonna get if you don't hand that map over Professor. Are we gonna have to beat him to death? Alright somebody else can work him over a little bit. (grunting) - Better talk Professor, right now. - You're such idiots. Do you believe those treasure stories? - Don't get involved in this Larazati. - But they'll kill you Professor. That treasure story is just a myth and the map isn't worth giving up your life for. Give it to them. The map's in here. (punches landing) (grunting) (glass breaking) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - That bitch. - Take that one. - Right. - Look out you crazy bastard. You okay Doris? - [Doris] He'll pay for this. (dramatic music) - Alright we'll do it. - Hydar help me, help me. (brakes squealing) (woman yelling) - [Hydar] Alright you hold it, hold it right there. - [Piet] Alright get your hands up all of you. - As you can plainly see you're greatly outnumbered here. So then if you want to go on living you'll hand over that map immediately. (punches landing) (grunting) - [Hydar] Come on John let's get out of here. - Oh yeah. - Stop them, after them, they're getting away. Come on Doris. - [Matt] Wait Hydar, wait for me. Don't go without me. - [Piet] Hurry up they're getting away. - [Doris] I'm coming, I'll drive. - [Hydar] Faster. - [Larazati] It won't go any faster. (upbeat music) - [Matt] Stop the car. - [John] Easy now we've got you. Alright get in will you? - [Mya] Get him into the car. (all talking at once) (upbeat music) (brakes squealing) (car exploding) (flames roaring) (dramatic music) - [Pilot] Hi, the people from the University. - [Mya] That's right let's go. - [Hydar] We have to take off immediately. Come on Mya get aboard. - [Pilot] Well she's all gassed up, ready to go. - [Hydar] Take this for me. - [Mya] Got it. - [Hydar] Can you see them John? - No we lost them. Let's get out of here. - Hang on. - Hey. - Come back. - Stop the plane. - Stop, stop. - Come back here. - Wait. - Look out Doris. (dramatic music) - Hey should we go back after your friends? - No, I don't think so. And so we bid farewell to civilization. - The professor warned us the trip was dangerous, only we haven't even gotten to the jungle yet. - Hey shut up. The professor was just trying to scare us into giving up the expedition. (dramatic music) (natives chanting) (men grunting) (calm music) - [Hydar] Okay last stop, everybody out. This is where were supposed to meet the great hunter. - [Pilot] Hydar, when do you want me to come back to pick you up? - About two weeks. If you aren't here when we get back, we'll pitch camp and wait for you. - [Pilot] Okay, good luck. - Thank you. - Thanks. - [Hydar] Watch your step Mya. - [John] So where is the guy who's supposed to guide us? - [Hydar] We'll wait for him in the clearing over here, come on. - [John] Hold it right there. - [Mya] No John. - [Bunyan] Smart boy. Out here it's always wise to be on your guard. - Mr. Bunyan? - That's right, I've been expecting you. Welcome to the bush. And you're Hydar the anthropologist right? - If I graduate, presently we're all still students. The professor told us about your missing daughter. I hope our expedition might turn up some trace of her. Allow me to introduce the members of our party. That's John. - Sir. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. - He's named after John Wayne. - And this is Mya. - How do you do? - Mya. - She's a journalist and a good photographer. - And this is Larazati, and-- - Matt Zolar, surfing champion and ping pong player par excellent. (all laughing) - Don't expect this expedition to be a picnic. It's gonna be rough going and it's gonna be dangerous. We'll be crossing that range of mountains over there, and that's just the beginning. Because the jungles beyond will be even tougher going. Keep your wits about you and follow my orders at all times. - We understand that sir. - [Bunyan] And don't call me sir. Makes me feel like I'm back in the army again. - [Hydar] Okay I'll try to remember that. - You'll spend the night at my place. We'll go to the island by boat tomorrow morning. The water voyage should be easy. But once we start our way into those jungles, be prepared. Because you'll see things you've never heard of before. So stay on guard. Do you have the map? Or didn't the professor trust you with it? - Yes, Larazati. - [Bunyan] Alright this is the course the professor and his party took down the river. When they reached this bend they were attacked. They had unwittingly come to close to a holy shrine and they aroused the wrath of the Witch Doctor. - I won't betray my friends, no way. - [Piet] All we want you to do is fly us there and drop us off where you dropped them. Raise the bid Doris, be generous. - Okay. - [Hydar] Which side of that rock should we stear for Bunyan? - [Bunyan] Bare to the left of it. Okay men shift your oars, over here over here all of you. - [Hydar] We're right behind you. - [Bunyan] Hang in there Hydar. - [Hydar] Hey Matt, there's one of your relatives. - No John, John put that gun away. Don't advertise our presence with gunfire. That aligator won't hurt you. Start using your head or you'll lose it. - Big shot. (speaking in foreign language) - Everybody keep a sharp look out. - [Larazati] They act like wild animals. - [Bunyan] We interrupted their dinner. - [Matt] I wonder if it was anybody we know. - It's nothing to joke about Matt. We're approaching the bend now everybody stay cool and don't act afraid. (speaking in foreign language) (John screaming) (all shouting at once) (dramatic music) - [Bunyan] We'll be safe here come on. - [Hydar] Mr. Bunyan look out, there's a python. Be careful Mya. - [Bunyan] He won't bother you if you don't bother him, come on. - Oh no I stepped on it, look out everybody, stand back, I'll kill it. - [Bunyan] Don't shoot John, put that gun away. If I have to tell you one more time, I'll take it away from you. (calm music) (dramatic music) - [Bunyan] John quick give Larazati your hand. - [Larazati] Help I'm slipping. - Hydar I can't hold her. (Larazati screaming) - Oh my God. (calm music) (dramatic music) - [Larazati] Put me down, put me down. (dramatic music) (men grunting) (somber music) - You know Mya's out there alone? I begged her to let me go with her but she insisted on bathing in private. (calm music) (Larazati screaming) - [Larazati] Hydar help there's a snake in my boot. - [Hydar] We're coming Mya, what happened? Oh my God can you give us help here? - [Bunyan] Here I'll get it. - [Hydar] It's okay Mya it's gone now, it's alright. (groaning in pain) - Bring me the medicine kit from my pack. - That's the last person it'll bite. (rifle firing) - I thought I told you not to shoot that gun under any circumstances. Now you're gonna be sorry you didn't listen. - Oh go to Hell. (rifle firing) (men grunting) (drums beating) - What the, what is that? (drums beating) - Are you satisfied now? Idiot. (drums beating) (spitting) - Drink it, it'll neutralize the snake poison in your blood. Go on. - [Hydar] Trust him Mya, it may save your life. - [Bunyan] It will. - Come on now. - I prefer the snake poison. (gagging) - [Man] Look out there. (gun firing) (men grunting) (punches landing) (grunting) (all shouting at once) (guns firing) (woman yelling) (punches landing) (grunting) - [Mya] Hydar, Hydar! (Bunyan groaning in pain) - [Hydar] Bunyan are you okay? Oh no. - [Matt] Oh no, how bad is he hurt Hydar? (Jelita grunting) - Let's go. (men shouting) - Oh God that's Larazati. - I know. (punches landing) (natives shouting) (natives shouting) (dramatic music) - [Hydar] Hi there. - Hydar? - [Hydar] That's right. (speaking in foreign language) (baby crying) (punches landing) (grunting) (natives chanting) (dramatic music) - [Mya] Hydar thank God. - [Hydar] Quiet you'll wake them up. (suspenseful music) (groaning in pain) - [Hydar] Careful Mya watch your step, you alright? - [John] Damn those savages. - [Mya] Hydar we've got to get out of here. - [Thug] I want the treasure map. (punches landing) - You fools this is no time to be fighting. - [John] She's right, they're right behind us. - [Hydar] Forget it John let's get out of here. - Are you alright? - I'm okay. (Jelita grunting) (punches landing) (natives yelling) (suspenseful music) - [Matt] Hey look out. I'll take care of it. - [Mya] Get if off of me. - [Matt] I've got him, get out of here go on. (speaking in foreign language) (groaning in pain) (dramatic music) (grunting) - [John] Oh man. - [Hydar] You okay? Come on, let's get out of here. (calm music) - [Hydar] Oh thanks. - Mama. (speaking in foreign language) - You're Mama had earrings like this? (suspenseful music) - [Bunyan] That necklace, where did you get it? That-- - No. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. (thunder rolling) - [Mya] I'll go with her. - It's her, that's my daughter she's alive. After all these years my dream has come true. How ironic to find her alive when I'm all but dead. (calm music) - [Jelita] You're necklace is so beautiful Mama. Will you give it to me please? - No I can't, it was a present from Papa. - [Jelita] Can I wear it for awhile? - I suppose it'll be okay. (laughing) - Alright. Take care of it, we'll share it. I'll let you wear it on Mondays and Thursdays. (loud bang) What is it what's wrong? - [Bunyan] Engine fire. (all shouting at once) - [Mother] Put on your life jacket just here. Oh Daddy will help you. (plane exploding) - [Jelita] Oh Papa! Papa, Mama! (tiger roaring) (birds singing) - I leave her in your care Hydar. Take, take her home. I provided for her in my last will. - My Papa? - Yes, yes my darling. - Papa. - My daughter, my precious one. - Papa, Mama, where be? - Mama, Mama has gone to Heaven and Papa is going there. Both of us will wait for you. Papa loves you. My darling, my precious baby, good (grunts) - Papa! (thunder rolls) (dramatic music) - Jelita, he's at rest, he's with your Mama in Heaven. And your Papa, he wants you to come with us to civilization. He's provided for you to be educated and have a good life. (water running) - [Mya] John please, what are you doing? Take your hands off me or I'll scream. - Oh don't give me that Mya. I've been in this jungle much too long and so have you. - Let me go, no. - Give me a kiss, come on all I want's a kiss. - Stop it John. - Hey. What's the matter with you Mya? What did you think I was trying to do huh? Did you think I was trying to rape you or something? All I wanted was a little kiss. Hydar won't know. I know what's wrong with you. You been running around with Hydar too long. You don't know how to handle a real man. No come one quit playing games. What's the matter you think I'm not good enough for you? Is that it? You bitch I'll show you who's good enough for who. Hydar I can't hear you. I could do with you whatever I want Understand me bitch? (slapping face) - John I warn you, don't you ever come near her again. - You son of a-- - You better watch it. - You may be the leader of this expedition but nobody pushes me around, you hear me good. (grunting) (punches landing) - That's enough, I don't want to hurt you. So don't you give us anymore trouble John, you hear? - You son of a bitch. (punches landing) (grunting) - What's that? - Looks like Hydar and John are having a little disagreement, Doris. - What's going on? (punches landing) (grunting) John will be approachable now. Make friends with him and I'll make friends with Hydar. He'll forget all about Mya by the time I'm through with him. That treasure map is as good as ours. (punches landing) (grunting) (Jelita yelling) - Are you okay John, what happened? What's this all about anyway? - Hold it. - [Jelita] Hydar come. - Hey, are you-- - Oh so sorry. - [Hydar] Well why'd you do that? - I guess I'm just jealous of that savage creature. I'd like to be a primitive woman. Come on Hydar why don't you get primitive with me? You and me and that treasure map would make a beautiful combination. - Don't do that. No wait stop it, Jelita, Doris. (punches landing) (grunting) (tiger growling) (punches landing) (grunting) (dart gun firing) (tiger growling) - Don't even speak to me John. You make me want to throw up. - Don't look at me that way Mya. I just want to apologize, please. I must have been out of my mind when I behaved so badly. But you're making a fool of yourself over Hydar. Mya, you mean you're gonna stand there and pretend to me that you haven't even noticed the fact that Hydar and that jungle woman have been falling madly in love with one another? Admit it. So then you have noticed? - It means nothing. - Oh Mya, we can still be business partners at least. That treasure map could be worth countless millions you know? And we could get that map easy by forming a partnership. - I couldn't do it, I just couldn't do that to Hydar. - Hydar doesn't want to share the treasure with us. So why should we want to share it with him? Talk to that jungle woman and see if you can trick her into telling us more about where the treasure is okay. Okay? Mya over here. See for yourself. What did I say? Romeo and Juliet. (calm music) - That slut. (dramatic music) - [John] You wanted to see me? - Well hello, I want to make a proposition. But first get comfortable. Come on I don't bite. Come on relax, I'm not like Mya. Well for one thing you'll find me more trustworthy. - Maybe. - Because I want you and she doesn't. And I'm your kind of woman John, you know that. You and I are unbeatable and I think we should be partners. - Might be possible. - I always get what I want, I'm irresistible you know. And so are you. (both laughing) (calm music) - All mighty God I come before to beg for your mercy. Forgive my sins and be my protector in this my hour of need. All mighty God, all merciful God I give you my heart. And I want do I get, a bare ass shoved in my face. Act human will you? Cut it out, haven't you ever heard of evolution? Come here yes, sit down here. (native grunting) Cover up. It would be easier to civilize you then this dumb animal here. You must learn to wear clothes see? It's immoral to run around naked. Now you try this on just like I showed you. No wait a minute. Now listen always keep that thing covered up. You could get arrested, put in jail. Flasher, understand, always keep it covered up. Do you want people to think you're immoral? (both grunting) If you're going back with us to civilization you'd better learn fast, come on. (dramatic music) (eerie music) (upbeat music) (drums beating) (groaning in pain) (arrow flies and thuds) - [Matt] Dead center, la la la la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la. Hey hold on, I have a gift for you and your wife. Here. (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (punches landing) (grunting) - [John] Grab the girl. - [Thug] I've got her, hold her. - [Doris] We've come for the map Mya and we mean business. (punches landing) (grunting) - [John] Drop that spear Hydar or I'll shoot. - So you're a traitor? I'm not surprised. - Don't call me name Mr. High and Mighty when I know you were planning to keep that treasure for yourself, weren't you? - Are you forgetting we promised the professor we'd leave the treasure untouched? You must be out of your mind. You've let your greed scramble your brain. Poor John, I burned that treasure map right after I memorized it. - So that's it? Well then you'll draw another one. (rifle firing) - Hold it John, put the gun down. If you kill him we'll lose the only chance that we have to get the treasure. The way to get to him is through the girl. (Doris yells in pain) (dramatic music) (punches landing) Don't let them get away John, after them. (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (punches landing) (grunting) (rifle firing) (Jelita yelling) (punches landing) (grunting) (Doris yells in pain) - Oh God Doris, I didn't mean to do that. It was an accident. - You idiot you killed-- (punches landing) (grunting) - [Hydar] Are you okay Mya? - Yeah, watch it. - Go help Matt. - Okay be careful. (Matt groaning in pain) - [Matt] Leave it alone. - [Mya] Come on get up, we've got to get out of here. (punches landing) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (punches landing) (grunting) (Jelita yelling) (punches landing) (grunting) (electricity crackling) (power exploding) (groaning in pain) - [Hydar] Mya, Mya? (speaking in foreign language) (John grunting) Mya? Where's John? - [Mya] What happened? - [Matt] He's looking for the treasure. (dramatic music) (laughing) - Mine, mine, the world is mine. (laughing) The world is my oyster. I'm the richest man in all human history. Mine, the treasure is all mine. And I don't have to share it with anyone else. I can have anything in the whole world that I want and nobody can take it away from me. I'll leave the others to die and no one will ever know what happened to them. (groaning in pain) No, no you'll never take my treasure away from me. It's mine. (punches landing) (grunting) (electricity crackles) (John laughing) That'll teach them to try to get my gold. It's mine, all mine all of it. Look over here, this is mine too, all of it. I'll live in a palace, I'll have any woman I want. I'm the richest man in the world. Do you understand me? I'm rich, all of this treasure, everything you see here is mine because I'm the one who discovered it and I don't have to share it with anyone. (punch lands) (Jelita groans in pain) You're too late, all of you are too late. The treasure is mine I discovered it, it's all mine. - [Hydar] John, get hold of yourself. - [John] I'm the richest man in the whole world. - [Hydar] You'll go mad, control yourself John, John. (rock explodes) (electricity crackling) (mountaintop explodes) Come on we have to get out of here. (mountaintop explodes) (John laughing) - What's that? Snakes, oh they're after my treasure. You can't have it, go away it's mine. Do you hear me the treasure is mine. You can't have it, go away, let me go. (John yelling in pain) (electricity crackling) (mountain exploding) - [Jelita] Hydar, Hydar. (dramatic music) (plane engine roars) (dramatic music)
