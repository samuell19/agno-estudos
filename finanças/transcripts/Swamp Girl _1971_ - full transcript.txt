(hand slapping) By God, that's one that aint gonna bite no more. - No, Fred, a few bites, you know fish always taste a little better if it aint come by quite legal. (slow mysterious music) - What the hell's that out there? (slow mysterious music) - What the hell was what? I didn't see nothing. - I saw something disappear into the darkness over there. - All right, you guys are seeing things. Probably some ol' gator on the prowl. Come on, let's get going. Those catfish love this light at night. We oughta catch us a big mess of them before that nosy swamp ranger comes moseying around here. Let's go. (slow mysterious music) Holy mackerel, what is this? - Who is it? How'd he get here? - Gators, huh? I told you I saw something in that swamp. - Look at that leg. (crickets chirping) - Well that's more than likely his. - Oh, man, cottonmouths. This guy aint got long to go. We gotta get help. Just stay quiet, Mister. We gonna get help. Hank, you go over and get help. Jesse can stay here with me. - Yeah. - Right. - There's a girl, in the swamp. - What'd he say? - Oh, he's out of his head, some nonsense about that girl who's supposed to live in the swamp. - It aint no nonsense. I've heard stories like that before. - Get going, you fool. Either he gets help or he's dead.

Heck, me and Hank had just been drinking a little beer over to Stokely's, and we was out getting a breath of fresh air before calling it a night. - Yeah, there's more of them probably with old Harry out in the swamps, out there poaching and doing some moonshining. He's the one stepped in the trap and got snakebit. That figures why these boys bring them in themselves, don't it? - Now wait a minute, Waters. You aint got no right to talk like that. Me and Hank might not be above catching a few fish by lamplight but we aint about to let a man that's been snakebit lay around and die just to save a $10 fine. - That's right, Sheriff. Hell, that coulda been any one of us out there. - Yeah, and somebody said that man was from down below Folkston. I don't know nobody down that way. - Well, don't let your conscience bother you none, boys. I checked down at Stokely's all right last night, and you were there. Playing pool and drinking a little beer till about a half hour before you decided to do a little night fishing on the side. Now that we got a little more light on the subject, Hank, tell me, you say when y'all pulled up here to the dock last night that somebody was pulling away as you pulled up and you saw 'em but Dent didn't see it, that right? - Well, Dent went to the truck to get some gear, and by the time, beer, I mean to get some beer, and the time he come back, we was just gonna sit around and listen to the air, and they'd already gone. - Yeah, and from where we was standing, we didn't see that poor devil till we was right on top of him. - You say he was mumbling something about a girl out in the swamp? - That's right, Sheriff. Hell, lotta people seen a girl in there, and that's what they call her, Swamp Girl. - (chuckles) Swamp Girl. Some of the things you guys cook up in them swamps, it's a wonder don't see something besides the Swamp Girl. - It ain't funny, Waters. You've allowed as how we mighta had something to do with that death. Accusing innocent men when there's somebody in that swamp maybe killing anybody that gets too close to knowing too much. - That's right. I think we oughta get together and go back in there and find out what's going on. - That's for sure. Buncha us boys oughta get us a buncha boats together and go over that swamp inch by inch and find out who's doing the killing. - Well, Denton, now that you've appointed yourself as sheriff, what are you gonna do, hold the trial right here in the swamp? - Well I just might do that... - All right now hold it. Now hold it, everybody. This place was set aside here to preserve life and not to take it. If there's any manhunting going on in there, I'm doing it. I'm betting that if there is somebody in there and they're helping these poor devils out when they get trapped in that swamp, well, they're doing it outta kindness. They don't feel like getting mixed up answering a lotta fool questions. - Well, I still wanna know what's going on in there. A man did die here last night, you know. - Denton, you know I know the swamps as well as anybody. And if there was somebody paddling up there last night, which is likely that they did, it's unlikely that they lived here in the swamp. May have been a moonshiner or a poacher trying to do a good deed, keep from getting involved. Now I'll get my airboat, go back in there and look for 'em. I can cover a lotta territory with it. If there's anybody in there, I'm gonna find 'em, and I'll bet you anything it won't be no Swamp Girl. - That's about the most sensible thing that I've heard all day, Jim. But you be careful out there, though. Old Boggy's a mighty big hunk of real estate, and we don't wanna have to come in there looking for you. Now why don't y'all go on about your business, and we'll let you know if anything happens? Come on, Jim. I'll give you a hand with your boat. - You know, I don't care what the sheriff or that smart aleck ranger says. - I don't either. - There's something mighty fishy going on in there. And if Waters don't find out what it is, there's some others of us just might could. - Right. - Come on. - Look, Jim, you know as well as I do that Dent Cole, he's nothing but 90% hot air, and all he's doing is just talking up to the crowd. - 90% hot air, I know that, and I also know that all of his friends are 90% hot air. But you take all the 90% hot air and take the 10% brains that they've got, you add it together, what have you got? - You got trouble. - Nothing but trouble. That's what starts trouble. - We've worked hard down in Okefenokee, trying to make a Leif place for wildlife, all the plants and everything else that lives here. Even a Leif place for sane people to come and visit. We can't be worried about a buncha characters coming out here and trying to play Cops and Robbers. - Now, Jim, you know that I aint gonna let that happen. Now I'll have my men keep an extra eye out for a few days till this thing kinda blows over. We got some law here. I'm it. - I know you are (laughs). I'm proud of you, I'm for you, I agree with you. But you see anything that's gotta do with the swamp involves me. - Take it easy, Swamp Rat. Call me when you get back, you hear? (engine starting) (upbeat dramatic music) (engine idling) (suspenseful music) (Jim screaming) (soft suspenseful music) - Why do these men keep coming in the swamp when they can't even see some ol' poacher's trap right in the middle of the trail? (metal clanking) I'd throw all their damn traps in the water, if they wouldn't keep coming back to look for them. - I'll be darned. There is a Swamp Girl. - Let me go. - Wait a minute. I'm not gonna hurt you! Wait a minute, calm down. - Let me go! - I wanna thank you for helping me. - Now leave me be. - I will, if you promise not to run away. - I'm not promising you nothing, not even to get you out if you get caught again. - Wait a minute. I come in here as a friend, because right now you need one. - I got all the friends I need, and that's my dad. And if he catches you, he aint gonna be half as kindhearted. - Okay, I'll let you go, but listen to what I've got to say. - You couldn't come in here to tell me nothing, because nobody knows that me and Pa live in here. - That's what you think. Now the people around the dock think it's you and your daddy killed that man you brought in last night. - That aint true. He stepped in a trip and he was floundering around trying to get back to his boat when the moccasins got him. Poor man. I knew it was too late. - Look, I'll make a deal with you. If my leg aint busted, and I don't think it is, if you don't wanna listen to what I've got to say you can run off, but sit over there out of my reach. I wanna talk. - Well, I don't know about that. - You aint got nothing to lose. I couldn't catch you if I tried. Probably won't even be able to get back to the boat. - Well, okay, but nothing fancy, do you hear me? - All right (groans). If I hadn't had these boots on, I don't know. I wished I'd catch them son of a guns that set them traps. (soft music) You know, getting caught in a bear trap sure makes a fella hungry. - You mean to tell me that all them traps is illegal, and that the men that put them there could go to jail if they get caught? - Sure could. You see, this whole Okefenokee Swamp is a park refuge, and all the wildlife, plants, trees, everything's protected. - You aint gonna arrest me for catching this little ol' duck, are you? I mean, me and Pa, we only kill what we have to for food. We never figured that was breaking any law. - No, I aint gonna arrest you. What'd you say your name was again? - My name's Janeen. - Janeen? That's a pretty name. I don't believe I ever heard that before. - I asked you if you was gonna arrest me. - No, I'm only gonna arrest the people that comes in here and tries to destroy the wildlife, kill birds just to get a feather to put in their hat. Or, like shooting alligators just to get them some boots made out of them, or a purse. Anything like that. - Every trap I find from now on, I'm gonna throw to the deepest, darkest part of that swamp. I always thought before I was messing with private property. You can get in lots of trouble for doing that. - Is that a fact? - Well since I'm a swamp ranger, I'll give you my permission. Matter of fact, I'd like to have somebody like you as a deputy. - Dep, deputy? What's that word mean? - Well in law enforcement, it means like an assistant or a helper. You still have the authority to arrest somebody too. Which brings me around to the point I wanted to discuss with you. - What's that? - Well, I guess it'd be hard to explain to you, honey, since you haven't been outside the swamp. But it's a rough world out there. Wicked. And, uh, it's good if you know somebody on the outside. - Why? The world leaves me and Pa alone, we leave it alone. Sounds fair enough to me. - Well, that's the trouble. The world won't leave you alone. It's gotten pretty complicated. That's the trouble of it. For an example, honey, there's people on the outside right now that thinks you and your pa is killers. And they'll be in here looking for you. Now if you wanna leave the swamps, you can. If you don't want to, that's your own business. But if you do go out, you need somebody on your side. - Me and Pa's too happy the way things are now. - Well I'm not trying to force you, but, well, you talk it over to your pa. And you tell him what we said and see what he has to say, and I'll be back in tomorrow. - You think you can even find me again? - You aint the only swamp rat in here. Found you this time, didn't I? - Yeah, but you wouldn't have, if that poor old man hadn't torn his shirt trying to get away from them snakes or if I'd seen it before you had. You'd just gone sailing right on by. - Well maybe so, but I can find you again. I'll be back tomorrow. - Well, I'll talk to Pa and see what he says about it. - Okay. Have it your way, but I'll still be back tomorrow. Thanks for the dinner. (slow mysterious music) - It's only me, Pa. - Who else? (door opening) - Don't know, Pa, but from what I hear, pretty soon, we aint always gonna know for sure. - What you mean by that, honey? From what you hear? - Well, Pa, I aint gonna lie to you. I had a long talk with a man today, and I promised him I'd tell you about it. - Honey, I thought we promised years ago we weren't gonna talk to nobody, because all they wanted to do was to make trouble for us. - I know, Pa. Well, after that poor man yesterday got so snakebit, Pa, that man died. Died. And that fella today said that the people outside this here swamp think that you and me's been doing the killing, and that they might come in here after us and... Well, just talk, so. - What else did you do, honey? - Well, nothing much really. I mean, I cooked us a duck and mostly we just sat around and talked. - Talked? About what? - Well, this man, his name is Waters, Jimmy Waters. He's what he called a, a swamp ranger. Pa, did you know that this whole park is a refuge? It aint legal to kill nothing or even to chop down the trees. And you know what else, Pa? Every one of them traps out there, they aint supposed to be there. They illegal. We can take 'em all and throw 'em in the deepest part of the water if we wanted to. Jimmy even said he'd make me a de, deputy. - (laughs) Is that all he come out here to the swamp for was to make you a deputy? - No, Pa. It's just one of the things we talked about. I told you. He told me that the people outside the swamp think that you and me has been doing all that killing. And, he was talking about how people like you and me can't keep living no more pretending there aint nobody else around and how someday we might have to leave here and go someplace else. We might need a friend on the outside. Pa? Pa, he wants to be our friend. He wants to meet me here tomorrow and talk on it some more and, well, I told him I'd ask you about it. Pa, Pa, can he be our friend? - Well, Janeen, I been seeing this coming for a long time. I just didn't know how to, how to get started telling you. I guess I was waiting for something. Waiting for something to force it. - Force what? - Well, in the first place, you gotta stop calling me Pa. - Why? You're my pa, aint you? - Honey, I love you like your pa, I raised you like your pa and I loved you like your ma too. But you see, honey, it aint the same thing. You can't call me Pa. You see, Black folks don't have White babies, no more than White folks can have Black babies. - But, if you aint my pa, then who is? I mean, why aint I never seen him before and how come I call you Pa? - Well, get yourself set, baby. Because we gonna go all the way back to the beginning. And when I'm finished, you just aint gonna be the same little girl no more. Now, don't call me Pa. Call me Nat, or Nathaniel, if you wanna get fancy or you're mad at me. Nat. Nathaniel. That's what old Doc named me years ago before you were born. You see, this house, this house was always kind of a home for fugitives. And ol' Doc, he fixed it up. He was a pretty good doctor, but he had kind of a weakness for whiskey, and then when folks come not to trust him too much, he started getting less worried about the kinda operations he did. - I, I don't understand, Pa. Nat? - You see, that's why it's so hard. I mean, it's just too much to tell you all at once. So just let me tell you about you and me, and then we'll fill in all the rest of the stuff later. Okay? - Yeah, sure, but... - Now, now ol' Doc, he found me years ago when I was a kid. In the swamp, half dead from snakebite. And then he brought me here, to his hospital, as he called it. And I helped him out around the place. So, little girls that was in trouble, I mean, that was gonna have babies that wasn't married, well, they came to ol' Doc, and he'd do the operations on them. - [Janeen] Is that how I come to live in the swamp? - [Nat] Well, you was sorta different. - When Doc did those operations, there really wasn't no baby. Now, honey, don't go getting yourself in particulars, or I won't get this story told. Sometimes, ladies would come that was too near having their babies to get the operation. And that's the way your ma was. So they'd pay ol' Doc to let them stay here until the baby come. And then they'd go away. - [Janeen] What about the babies? Didn't the moms take 'em with 'em. - [Nat] Well, some did and some didn't. Doc never did much care, except for the boys. He always made the mothers take the boys. See, they could take care of themselves. It was a batch of girls he wanted. - [Janeen] But how could a mama just go off and leave her baby like that? Even the animals in the swamp take care of their young'uns. - [Nat] That's true, dear, but some mothers are just that mean. - [Janeen] Mine was one of 'em? - [Nat] I'm afraid so, darling. But now listen, you gotta just let me get this story told so it gets told complete. Then we'll go back when there's time and fill in all the little holes. - Okay, but what did the doc do with the children whose mamas left the sw... Why was I the only one that growed up here in the swamp? - Honey, that aint easy to say. But, he sold 'em. - He sold 'em? - Yeah. - You mean, like you used to tell me about your granddaddy? He sold them like slaves? - I'm afraid so. - But you told me yourself, that aint right. There aint no more slavery. - Well, honey, I wish that were true, but it aint. The truth is, there's still some places in this world where a little girl is worth a lotta money. Especially a little White girl. And the doc, he had a lotta contacts down at the Harbor, where the ships would come in from all over the world to buy lumber from the swamps. And he had a lotta friends that paid him a lotta money for nice little girls. And then they would sell them back for even more money. Where there was no trees and there wasn't no little White girls. - If that's true, how come I didn't get sold too, along with the rest of them? - Well, honey, that gets us to the part about why you and me is living alone here in this swamp. See, you was always a special kinda girl, and you was always my favorite. (soft music) And Doc took a liking too you too. You had a way about you. A kindness with animals, a way of smiling. I knowed everything Doc was doing was wrong, but I had no other home, no place to go, as far as I knew. And Doc led me to believe that the police was still looking for me for stealing a pair of jeans when I was a little boy. Well anyhow, I guess I always looked the other way when Doc did something I knew was wrong. But with you it was different. I begged and I pleaded that he wouldn't sell you away. But ol' Doc, he was greedy. He was always hoarding away the money he took in and asking for me. He knowed someday he'd get caught, and he wanted money to buy off the police or the judge, or the jury. Or to run away. But he wanted money. One day, he give me some money to sneak outta the swamp and go to Leif Turner. (soft suspenseful music) I aint never told you about Leif Turner. He's one of the ones on the outside that wouldn't be your friend. He got a snake farm on the edge of the swamp. Mean as any snake you ever wanna find around here. Leif Turner, he's one of the ones on the outside that brings in the girls. And other stuff we needed, and he still does. Costs a lot more than any store would charge. But he don't ask no questions. (soft mysterious music) I seen Doc drunk often enough. But there was something funny about the way he acted that set me thinking. So much so that I figured I'd sneak back just in case what I was thinking turned out to be true. (soft music) - Well, I've changed my mind. Now this little lady is worth more than that. I want twice the normal amount. - (chuckles) You're drunk, Doc. I got your normal amount right here, so we'll take the girl. - That's right, Doc. You sent word you had one. We're here to collect her. - Listen, that's right, but I done changed my mind about the price. Now I know what you gonna get for her from one of them Arab sheiks. Yeah, thousands. She's young, strong. She's mighty, mighty pretty. So I'll take a thousand for her, or it's no deal. (soft suspenseful music) - $1,000 or no deal. All right, Doc. No deal. Take the girl! (Janeen screaming) (punches striking) (Doc screaming) (suspenseful music) (Janeen wailing) All right, come on. Let's get going. - Wait a minute. What's your hurry? I know Doc's got a lotta money stashed around here. Why don't we see if we can find it? - Because, stupid, that nigger may be stomping around out there, and he just may find a shotgun. And he just may blow you and I to hell. Let's get outta here. (Janeen wailing) - You're probably right. It's a shame to leave all that dough behind. - Oh, come on, will you? (Janeen wailing) (suspenseful music) (Janeen wailing) (ax striking) (snake rattling) (Janeen wailing) (dramatic music) - [Nat] Well, baby, you was bit real bad. I really thought you were gonna die. But I did what I seen Doc do. I cut open the bite, and I tried to suck out the poison. But mostly I let you lay there and try to fight the poison yourself. Oh, you was a stubborn little devil, and you just wouldn't give up. You had a fever that would kill a horse. But slowly, slowly, you come around. But when you got better, well, it was funny. Like the fever done something to your brain. You didn't remember nothing about Doc, or the two men. So, I figured it was better that, uh, that I left it that way. Sorta the way nature intended it. But see, I always knew there was gonna come a time when I'd have to tell you. - Pa, Nat, I'm so mixed up. What am I gonna do? I mean, should I go see Mr. Waters tomorrow? I kinda have to now. He knows, knows we're here. - Well, darling, that's a tough one. The first thing I was gonna say was no, don't go. Even if it meant leaving here and living somewhere else in the swamp. But then I got to thinking. If something should happen to me, you gonna need a friend on the outside. And this here ranger you been talking about, he sounds like a pretty good man. - Think I ought to go then, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. (gentle music) - You know, Jim, if there was anybody else but you telling me this, I wouldn't believe it. You mean, you found a girl out there in that swamp, a Swamp Girl? - I really did. - So you got yourself a cute little girlfriend now, and aint nobody gonna take her away from you, huh? - Listen, Cutler, I'm serious. You know as well as I do that it's illegal to live in the Okefenokee. Because it's a wildlife refuge. If somebody find out you're in there, they gonna come in, move you out. And if they move her out, then we really have got a problem. She aint never been on the outside. She knows all there is to know about cottonmouths, gators, everything else, I guess, in the swamps. But she don't know anything about the outside. She's liable to get knocked down by the first car that passes. - Yeah, or knocked up by the first boy that comes by. - Listen, I'm serious. We've got a problem. - Now hold it, Jim. You know I was just joshing you and trying to get you riled up. It's fun to get you all riled up. And besides, I know we got a problem. But look at the bright side of it. The mystery's all cleared up, and there aint no murderer here in the swamp. It's just some folks out there that like to be left alone. Now, if you should see her tomorrow, maybe you can talk her pa into coming in with her, and you and me'll give them a hand and try to help them get settled. We might get her a little schooling. Things could just work out fine. - Well I durn sure hope so. (radio beeping) - That's my ring. Be right back. (soft suspenseful music) Sheriff Cutler here, over. (upbeat dramatic music) - [Steve] Dammit, we're outta gas. (upbeat dramatic music) Uh-oh. (siren blaring) (upbeat dramatic music) - See, what I tell you? We shoulda hit that little store back there so we'd have some gas. But no no, not you, smarty pants. Now we don't even have enough to make it across the line. And that damn cop looking for us. - Not us, honey, you. You're the brain that went and killed that prison guard back there. Oh yeah, yeah, something to bust out of a prison camp, but killing a guard doing it. Man, you're something else. Who the hell do you think we are, Bonnie and Clyde? All right, we're both in it together. Now what the hell do you wanna do? - We'll put as much distance between us and this car as possible. Because if they find it, they're gonna know we been here. Which way is the Florida state line? - That way, through the swamp. - Then that's the way we're gonna go. Let's get it on. - You're crazy. You gotta be crazy! That's the Okefenokee Swamp in there. They got everything in there. They got alligators, they got snakes. There's not one square foot of solid ground in there. We could drown in that damn place. - Well that's a good place to hide. Now I know there's people going in there and coming out alive. Aint you read about them moonshiners and poachers? Let's walk alongside the swamp. I know there's a boat hidden there somewhere. There's gotta be. We might even find us a still. - That's the best thing you said all day long. - Come on, it's getting dark and some nosy cop might recognize that car. Come on! (soft suspenseful music) - Come over here. Follow me. (soft suspenseful music) All right, honey, you asked for it. (soft suspenseful music) Damn. (soft suspenseful music) I told you there wasn't one square foot of solid ground around here, but you won't listen to me, will you? Well, come on. You wanted to go this way! (soft suspenseful music) (water splashing) (soft suspenseful music) (water splashing) (soft suspenseful music) We'll try and get across over here. (soft suspenseful music) No, honey, wait up. We aint gonna make it this way. Go over here. (soft suspenseful music) Honey, we're gonna have to stop here for the night. All we're doing is going around in circles. Last thing we wanna do is fall in a pothole and get drowned. - I hate to agree with you, but I guess you're right. - There's some high ground up there. Come on. (soft suspenseful music) (birds calling) - Steve? - What? - I'm scared silly. - (chuckles) You'd be a damn fool if you wasn't, honey. (soft suspenseful music) (wings flapping) (soft suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (wind whistling) (engine starting) (upbeat dramatic music) - You really think I ought to go, huh, Nat? I mean, still haven't found the cabin yet. - Well, I think so. Seeing as how he's almost found out where we is. - Well, oh, I don't know what to do. Seems like everything's just happening all at once. - Well, I guess that's my fault. I shoulda been getting you ready for this a long time ago. - Well, I guess it don't make no real difference now. (soft suspenseful music) (engine revving) (soft suspenseful music) - Holy mackerel, there's a house here right in the middle of the swamp. - Sh, might be somebody around. Take a look inside. Maybe there's some food to eat. - Yeah, well, don't you go using that thing because you only gone one shell left. - I know. Come on, let's get going. (soft suspenseful music) (metal clanging) (soft suspenseful music) - That you, Janeen? (gun firing) (Nat groaning) (wings flapping) (water splashing) (wind whistling) - Suppose somebody else comes around here? We aint got anymore shells left, baby. - We'll use this. - Oh, why don't you ever cut yourself a potato? - Pa! Nat, Nat! - Get up off there, right now too! - Why did you do this (cries)? - Okay, little girl, you must know your way out of this godforsaken swamp, and you're gonna take us outta here. I don't mean to no big town either. I mean to some quiet road on the way to Florida. I could steal me a car. Do you hear? - You killed Nat, the only friend I ever had! - I killed an old nigger that got in my way, dammit! I'll kill you too if I have to. Now take us outta here! - All right. I'll take you out. - Let's get outta here. This whole place is giving me the creeps. (soft suspenseful music) - Hey, not that way! We came in over there. - If you come in over there, you been walking in circles. - All right, let's go. - Janeen? There's no need to hide. I'm all by myself. Come on out. (soft mysterious music) Well, I guess Cutler's got a laugh on me now. - I'm sorry, ma'am. The sheriff's out in the swamp. You'll just have to wait'll he gets back. - Well I'm not satisfied with that. Come on, Gif, we'll go to the swamp and find our baby ourselves, come on! - Right, honey. - Pardon me. Excuse me for butting in, folks. But I understand your concern and I just wanted to let you know there's a lotta folks around here don't think much of that sheriff or that smart aleck deputy neither. - Well we appreciate your interest, Mr. Um? - Cole, ma'am. Denton Cole. - Pleased to meet you. I'm Ella Martin, and this is my husband, Gifford. - Most people just call me Gif. - Pleased to meet you. They all call me Dent. - How do you do? - What I wanted to say is that going into that swamp can be dangerous iffin you don't know your way or have good boats. Now, me and my friends, Hank and Jesse here, well, we're regular swamp rats. Know the Okefenokee as well as any man. More than likely better. Now if you happen to be looking for some guides, why... - Well I tell you now, that sounds interesting enough. How much for guiding around here? - Well, you know, everything's gone up a sight. Lotta folks around here aint never been so hard put to make do. It'll be me and the boys, mighty experienced, and of course the boat, right good boat. Then there's a problem with the law. Sheriff Cutler aint gonna take too kindly to us messing in his business. I expect we'd have to... - I'll give you $500, Mr. Cole. If you find my baby before anybody else does. And we'll give you 500 more if you can happen to get her to Florida. - That's right. - Mr. Martin, Gif, you just made yourself a deal. Come on, boys, let's get ready to go. - Okay. - Now you wait for me at the hotel, honey. I'll be in touch the minute we find her. Don't you worry now. - All right. - Howdy, Ben. Now don't you start needling me, because I aint in no mood for it. She didn't show. - Don't worry, Jim, I won't because we got a much bigger problem than that now. I just hope that it's not tied into Janeen not showing up out there in the swamp. - Oh really, what happened? - Well you remember when I got the call last evening? It seems that there was a prison break down at the woman's farm there in Weedville. Some bow hunk got in there and tried to bust his girlfriend and, we guess that she shot and killed a guard with a shotgun. - Well I'll be durned. - Yeah, and they stole a car and came town this a-way. We found the car down below Waycross, and it was outta gas, and the best that we can figure, they gotta be out here somewhere in the swamp. - I wonder if that had anything to do with Janeen not showing up. - We don't know, Jim, but I'll tell you one thing. I'm gonna feel a lot better when we get that pair under lock and key where they belong. - Durn, I hope she aint got nothing to do with it. - Just a minute, there's a call. Be right with you. Hello, Tom, this is Cutler. What is it, over? - [Tom] That Martin guy just hired Cole along with Hank and Jesse to guide him into the swamp. - Well what am I supposed to do about that? Hell, I could probably get him fined for guiding without a license, but I got too much on my mind right now. - [Tom] I know, Ben. I just thought you'd like to know, over. - I'm sorry, Tom. You're right. It's just that that Cole, he's bad news no matter where he is. Anything else, over? - [Tom] That's it, over. - Okay, but you just stay tuned to the rangers radio frequency because we gonna be out there in his airboat cruising around, and we might need to get back in touch with you, over and out. Well you were worried, so now you got me worried. Let's go see what we can see. (suspenseful music) - Well now, howdy, gentlemen. What can I do for you? - Leif, we got a little proposition for you. This here's Mr. Martin. We think his little girl's lost in the swamp. (wind whistling) (Carol shrieking) (water splashing) - [Carol] Snake right there. I don't know what it is! Wait a minute. Help me. Help me. Please help me! Oh God, it's there. - Come on, get up here. Get up here. - [Carol] It's dragging me. - It aint dragging you nowhere. Now get up here. Give me that gun. - Grab the bushes. Pull yourself up with the bushes. (bushes rustling) - We been walking for hours, and it don't look no different. I don't want no funny stuff from you, you hear? - You can walk through this swamp for days and it won't look no different. And to get out of it, there's gonna be times when we gotta wade and swim. It aint gonna look no different. - She's right, girl. I been watching the sun. She's heading south toward Florida. - Ha ha, real swamp rat, aint you? - I've been around some, honey. - Knock it off, you two, let's get moving. (Steve hollering) - Come on. (leaves rustling) (engine revving) (upbeat music) - Well, friend, looks like you're gonna have to show me where she lives after all, huh? - Well that's not the problem. I only know where I met here. I don't know where her house is. - Well we still have a problem then, don't we? I guess we better do a little more looking, huh, Jim? - Stick with me, Hoss. I won't let you down. (engine roaring) - Well now that just don't make much sense to me, Cole. I mean, you want me to tell you how to get to a house in the swamp, which I don't know where it is. And, if you find this missing girl, you gonna give me $20 (chuckles). I don't know what you talking about. - Okay, Leif. Mr. Martin, I got a little personal business here with Mr. Turner, would you mind waiting for us in the truck? I think he might find it a little easier to talk if there wasn't no strangers around. - Sure, I understand. - Okay, now, Leif, I know you know where that house is. And if it's still there, that Swamp Girl lives in it. She'll be able to find them kids for us. I think you oughta tell us while you still can. - You're crazy, Cole. I don't know nothing. - Now you listen to me. 10 years ago, I give Thelma Lacey money to go over and see the doc. She told me who took her. You did. I never said nothing for obvious reasons, but I'm a-saying it now. - I don't know, Cole, that's a long time ago. I forget! - You know, old buddy, I aint got time to play games with you. (Leif groaning) Give me that rope. (dramatic music) - [Leif] No (groans)! Let me up! (men chattering) Oh no! (men shouting) - [Denton] Okay, boys, hoist him up there. - No, Cole! Let me up! (snakes rattling) Cole! - [Denton] Okay, boys, lower him down till one of two things happens, he remembers or he forgets everything. - Cole, come on, I'll tell you. Just get me outta here, Cole! Why don't you tell us while you're down there. It seems to be helping your memory. - All right, all right. You take Green's Channel into the swamp. When you get to Buxton Slide, you make another right now, you hear? It's about two miles long. It seems like you come to this little oak that's all covered over with solid land and cypress, but it aint. Back in there, about two miles, you come to this little tiny oak and it don't look like much, but it gets bigger, twisting and turning. About 500 yards, you see the house. I guess you will! I aint been there in 10 years, not since Doc died but it's there. Now pull me out, Cole! - Okay, boys, pull him up. Let's get outta here. (both straining) - I'll get you, you son of a bitch. I swear, I'll get you. - Get him, all right? Don't get us. We're scaring him a little. - [Leif] You're damn right I'm gonna get you! - Well, Leif, we can't have none of this, never knowing who might sneak up behind us. (knife slicing) (Leif screaming) (birds singing) - Wait here, Steve. Our lady friend needs a moment of privacy. Come on, let's go, and no funny stuff. (engine revving) (engine revving) (suspenseful music) - Over here! Then we'll be back on the trail. (suspenseful music) (Steve screaming) - Hold it! You dirty lying little swamp bitch! You get him outta there, or I'll blow your brains out! - Not with that, you won't. I been listening to you two. You used one of them shells on the guard and the other one on Pa/Nat. - I reloaded. Now you come on and help me. - Look at those clothes you're wearing. You couldn't carry a dry pin in them pockets. (dramatic music) And if you wanna get outta the swamp alive, you better be able to follow me. (gun thudding) (engine revving) - I don't know, Ben. We can't be too sure as to find Janeen. But they did have as good a chance as anybody else. - That's right, and I'll tell you something else. They're really not after Janeen, but if those kids do find her out there, they're more than likely gonna force her or her pa or maybe both of them to lead them outta this swamp. - You're right. - If that does happen, they gonna have to cross some water out there somewhere. I think our best bet is to just cruise around out here in the boat as quiet as possible and keep our eyes and ears open. - Yeah, because if they hear us coming, they're gonna run and hide anyhow. - That's right. Let's go. (soft suspenseful music) - She's been here, all right. She's a real sweetheart, that'un is. - You don't know for sure if she done it. Come on, you're getting paid good money to find her. - Well, it aint likely they had a boat. We'd have seen them trying to get out as we come in. No sign of there being one here. They must be trying to cross that swamp on foot. - Damn fools if they think they can get outta that swamp. - Well if they killed that old man in there, they aint got nothing to lose. This way. (upbeat dramatic music) - When I get my hands on you, I'll rip your eyes out! - What's the matter, killer? Afraid of a little old swamp? You aint so tough without your shotgun, are you? Come on now and run! (dramatic music) (Carol grunting) (dramatic music) - Wait. Did you hear that? I could swear I heard a girl scream. - Oh, don't let the swamp noises fool you, Gif. A man can stand out here in the swamp and hear just about anything he wants to hear. - Don't tell me what I hear and I don't hear. I heard a girl scream. Come on, it was this way! (upbeat dramatic music) - [Carol] I'm coming! I'm coming! (dramatic music) (Carol screaming) (Carol screaming) (dramatic music) (Carol screaming) (dramatic music) - My God, what you done to my baby? My little girl! It was you, you little swamp rat bitch! - No, wait. Come back here. I aint gonna be a part to no more killing. Give me that gun! - Get him off me! - Don't stand there like idiots! (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (gun firing twice) (Ben shouting) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Where's the Swamp Girl, Janeen? - Over onder in the bush, where she fell. - Hold it. Don't be a fool, Martin! (gun firing) (dramatic music) (Gifford groaning) (Gifford screaming) You and your flunkies come give me a hand! If it aint too late. (Gifford screaming) (birds calling) - The dirty son of a... Hey, honey, you all right? - Oh, Jimmy, I'm so scared! - Don't be scared. - Jimmy, that girl, the gators killed her, and I just let them. I didn't do nothing to help. And she killed my pa. She killed Nat. He was my only friend. - No, honey, you gotta lotta friends. You'd be surprised the friends you have. Don't worry about it. Everything'll be all right. You scared the hell out of me. I thought you was dead. (Jim chuckling) You all right? (birds singing) You all right? You'll be all right. Come on, honey. This is Waters, Unit Four. Do you read me, Tom? - [Tom] Roger, Jimmy, loud and clear. Any luck? - Yeah, but mostly bad. You better have an ambulance and, what's her name? Mrs. Morton, to meet us at the dock. - [Tom] Roger. Anything else, over? - No, that's all for now, but stay on the same frequency. Unit Four clear. (birds calling) (birds calling) (boat creaking) (engine revving) (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (dramatic music) (engine chugging) (dramatic music) (soft music) - Watch his head! (soft music) (Ella crying) - Oh God, Gifford, speak to me. Please. Oh God (cries). Gifford. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Martin. With these many bad bites, there's nothing we can do. I'm sorry. Take him away. (soft music) - Where's my baby? Where's Carol? - She's dead too. Swamp Girl there fed her to a big gator. - That aint true! She stepped in a bear trap, fell in the water! - I'll kill you! - Now just hold it! - Don't you worry, Janeen. Everything's all right, honey. Janeen? It's all right. - What he call you? - My name is Janeen. - How'd you come by that name? They told me you was a swamp rat with no folks and no kin and no name. - My pa, I mean my friend Nat, the one Carol killed this morning, he give it to me. He said my ma, before I was born, told him, if it's a girl, call her Janeen. It was her ma's name. - Oh my God. After all these years. After, after all the pain, the guilt, my own daughter comes back to kill my husband and my daughter. - I didn't kill them. The snakes got your husband. I wasn't even there. He was trying to kill me. Oh, I'm, I'm so mixed up. - You're all right, honey. It's all right. - And even if you are my mother, why should I care about you? You left me in the swamp, knowing what ol' Doc did to those girl children. - Janeen, it's too much to hope you could ever forgive me, but please try and understand. Please try. Your father was in the service, and when he went overseas I didn't know I was pre... I didn't know I was gonna have a baby. And then, then your pa was killed. And of course, when it began to show, how I was, my pa was furious, and he'd have killed me for shaming the family if my mother hadn't stopped him. That's why I wanted the baby named for her. Of course they threw me out and I didn't have no place to go. Well, I heard of ol' Doc over in the swamp, and I'd been working, and I saved a little. And you was almost here by then. So I went to him. But he told me he always found good homes for his kids. Oh, Janeen, my baby! We're all each other has now. Please, come with me. Let me try and make up some of the wrong I done for you. Oh, Janeen, Janeen, please! Please come! - I'm going back home. Jimmy, I know now that I can't live out there forever, but just let me have some time by myself out in the swamp please. With them knowing where the house is, I won't be able to stay out there for long anyway. - Don't you worry, honey, where they going, they won't bother nobody for a long, long time. - Hey, Cutler, what do you mean by that? We aint done nothing. - We'll see about that. It just so happens that Leif Turner's woman arrived over there at the snake farm just about time you boys pulled away from over there. About five minutes before she found him tied up and dead in the pit. Guess you fellas just aint too smart. Let's take them in, Tom. - I've just gotta think all this over. - Honey, I understand. Your first day in civilization hasn't exactly been the pleasant side. But there is one, and you'll see. - I know. I trust you, and Ben. I'll be back out later. I promise. - Okay. - Don't worry. I'll bring this here boat back. Then maybe you can make me a, a dep, a deputy. - A deputy, yeah.
