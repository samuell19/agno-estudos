Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. This movie is inspired by real events in Czechoslovakia from 1989 to 1990. The story and characters of the movie are, however, fictitious. Any similarity with real people is purely coincidental. Speak! Shit! What is it? What?! Go out there and make some money! Where are those paintings? Loser! You were screaming again. You want some to calm down? Piss off! Prisoner Sedivý. LEOPOLDOV PRISON Prisoner Sedmohradský. Prisoner Dimitrov. Prisoner Čierny. I asked for two books! So read this one twice! I haven't been in good mental shape this week. The endless waiting is awful. They keep telling me they'll interrogate me, and they always leave the light on. Even at night. But yesterday, when I thought I was about to lose my mind, I tried to look at things from your point of view: at least I can see the rats. Your perspective is the only thing that gives me hope, my friend. Here is the list of books for the other block. Two items! Seems to me only the politicos are reading. AMNESTY Happy at the TV station? Is it like you pictured it? It was your dream, right? Oh, don't give me that look. You wrote a lot about petty thieves at the TV station, but there wasn't a single word in your reports about Richard Kelemen which is why we're sitting here now. You're missing the point! What about the paintings? When will you finally visit your husband? I believe we've done quite a lot for you recently, I would expect some sort of gratitude, solely on a personal level, regardless of your obligation towards us. I'm glad we had such a lovely chat. Bye! Kamil, please take me home. Let's go! Let's go! Come on, go for it! Let's go! Jump him! Let's go, lets's go - give it to him! Let's go, let's go - give it to him! Let him go, Férovka, you'll kill him. You really thought the little fuck could win? Take him away. Now I'll give you the tour. We've had some issues recently, so I won't tolerate brutality towards prisoners, conspiracy, alcohol, lack of discipline, or bullying. If someone breaks the rules and regulation of this institution. They'll be fired immediately. Even a prisoner is a person. We have no right to judge them, that's someone else's job. Therefore you will treat them well. You're expected here 20 minutes before your shift. This fortress is 300 years old. It looks like it. Welcome to Leopoldov, Gentlemen! I'm Lieutenant Imrich Hromžík, Head of Security. You can address me by my rank. It doesn't look like much, but we have the latest security systems, everything is monitored with cameras, all gates and doors are controlled electronically. HASEK! HASEK! HASEK! What's going on now? Ice hockey, again. Let me guess, Gujda! Yeah. HASEK! HASEK! HASEK! What's up gentlemen? Chilling? HASEK! HASEK! HASEK! Open up row 4, cell 17. I'm here with two policemen. HASEK! HASEK! HASEK! Quiet here! Hasek is the best! Not a single goal! Not a single goal, you fuck-face! And you talk shit about him!? Hey! He is the best! He is a dummy! Hasek is the best! No one can beat him! You know why Russians are the fastest? Come on, come on, tell me! Because they practice with 85 kg of extra weight. Sort it out! And what do you think Hasek does? He works out with balloons? -Fucking dumbhead! Hasek is the best! -Cool it! Cool it! We are cool. Who do you root for? Me? Our team. Our team? Not the Russians? They carry 100 kilo weights when they skate in practice. I was just telling you! They must be the best! Quiet here! The championships ended six months ago. Are you all so slow? If you do stage another hockey riot, I won't allow you to watch TV for a month! There will be quiet! All clear, Gujda? We're calm as jasmine tea. Let's go. Hey, kid! I hope they didn't eat all the cakes! Me too sweetie! Quiet! Quiet please! Look, she's here again. -Last rehearsal before we shoot! -Come on, you'd better sit down. Stan? Ready? Ready! Please! Please! Can you let me go? We have seen each other before, but let me introduce myself. I'm Miriam Kelemenova Jana Wernerova Kelemenova Karin Lupkova We are make-up girls. We've seen each other before too, but you've probably forgotten. You're right, I forgot. How are you handling it? What? I know about the situation with your husband, Leopoldov is an awful prison I truly admire how you're dealing with it. You certainly don't have it easy either. Yeah, this bit shows my husband is an amazing actor. In reality he would be the last one to hang himself for some woman. It's just not Richard's fate. Stan, I've had enough of this, are we making a comedy? I think they've finished. I'll get the cakes. Are you OK? I'm OK, but she probably isn't. She just sits around here on her disability pension, while she acts like a dissident. I thought you were OK with it. I'm fine, I'm happy! I see. Jana, get this off. Sorry Jerks. I'm really fed up with all of it. Got it? Here you go. You have some jam over here. You are a little dirty here. I have a longer break after the rehearsal on Friday. Will you come? So what? What, what? He loves me! Oh man! What's going on boys? Do we have a problem? Problem? Back to work! Alright. Are you fucking crazy, dealing here? I need money for the doctor. He won't do shit unless I pay. This business is only for the privileged. Čierny wrote to me again. He lost his messenger. He asked me if I could get out a message through someone. -Here we go. -Calm down. My brother will come next weekend. They allowed me a visit. I'll take care of it. Lunch! If they find out, they'll triple our sentences. So what, at least we're no pussies. You don't wanna do it? You were robbing their houses! This is different! No! This is the real deal! Listen, why are you writing to him? He's an interesting man. Let's go kid! I'm gonna take a shit. Don't do anything stupid! The man you trust so much, and I hope you're right to do so, should deliver the message to the address written on the other side. He must do so when Marta is at work. The house is not guarded at that time. Thank you, dear friend! I'm indebted to you. My dad used to make handles out of antlers. We never ate deer. Dad killed the dear, shot it, cut off its head and left everything else there. He'd say wolves needed to eat something, too. Why are you sitting down? Get up right now! Ever since that fuck-up with Kraus and Férovka, the guards are watching our every move. Turn it off before I have a fucking heart attack. I'll report you, and they'll take it away, you'll see! Finish it, Rigo! Ah, someone deserves a reward! Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Very funny, Wolf. What the fuck are you laughing at?! What! Do you have a problem? Why do you keep fucking laughing? I'll laugh whenever I want, dickhead. Dickhead? Be glad you didn't eat that. Stop smiling! Why? Žiga! Let it fucking go! Žiga!! Fuck! Defense alone is not enough for a champion. What's going on here!? Hey! Gujda?! Comrade warden, Žiga choked on something, and Lupko was administering first aid. Lupko, you're coming with us, let's go! Let's go! Yeah, Yeah. Next time I tell you to let it fucking go, you'll make it fucking go, kapish? Fuck, they've found out. Don't panic, Škrečok! Open the gate! Come in! Comrade Lieutenant Hromzik, prisoner Lupko. Dismissed. Sit down, Lupko! Influential people whose villas you've robbed made things really hot for you. You got the longest possible sentence. You didn't return those paintings. They're not going to leave it like that. The paintings are from state galleries. Big shots are gifting them to each other as if they belonged to them. You consider that normal? That's none of my business, Lupko. You recognize this kid? Internally, we dealt with the situation. The perpetrator no longer works here. Férovka was an asshole. I'm not interested in your comments, Lupko. Will you help me? I don't think I follow. He's your student from the karate club, isn't he? Yeah, so? I need you to, persuade Kraus that his injury was self-inflicted. Self-inflicted. Yes, self-inflicted. I know, it doesn't look like it, but I need it to look that way. And what makes you think I can persuade him? Well, you're his former coach. Former! Exactly. Besides, I'm not sure if I feel like saving that communism of yours. Oh please Lupko, to hell with communism. Don't pretend to be a dissident. Just help me fix this stupid situation. I can offer you certain advantages in return. I'm listening. What do you want for helping me with Kraus? Transfer to a different cell. Immediately. -And the same for Važanský and Cviko. -Lupko, please.. Do it, and we have a deal. Reason? We're non-smokers. OK. I'll arrange the transfer, but not immediately and not at the same time. Do we have a deal? Deal. I could authorize more frequent visits from your wife, too. Hmm, that's OK. I received a message from Josef, finally. That's great, that's wonderful! But you know what, it's… I know, it's a struggle for both of us. I'm sorry, Miriam but… I'm not underestimating your commitment for the cause, but our situations are completely different. We're being watched, too. It's just not that obvious. I woke up on Saturday before dawn and three men were searching my flat. I was scared to death. Can you even imagine that? I clean up after one raid here comes another. They are trying to break you mentally, but don't do them that favor. I'm sorry about that outburst. I'm totally… I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do now. I have an important message from Prague, for Jozef. But I don't have a clue how to get it to him. They won't allow me any visits. All I know is that Jozef can communicate with a prisoner from the library. Maybe I can help you. I know someone who can get in there. I have it with me, always. Someone must've told the cops. And the only ones who knew were me, the boys and you. Me? Why would I squeal? You went completely mad inside. I'm locked up too! Yeah, but with the minimum sentence? A bit strange, isn't it? The cops were everywhere! What should I've done? I tried to run away. Igor, they were waiting for us there. They were tipped off. Who talked? It wasn't me. Honestly, I swear! Ok, if you want to help me, tell them what they want to hear. So, what? Did you get it done? I guess so. Good job Hromzik. Tomorrow at the press conference he needs to be brief. The interpreter will take care of it, OK? Good afternoon, Mr. Gajdos. Good afternoon, Mrs. Kelemenová, should I call your husband? I'll find him myself. Wait! I have to sign you in! What an admirable work drive. Richard loves to do it by the mirror. One day when he finds out how to fuck himself you'll all be screwed. I don't know what you're talking about. A friend of mine gave me this. It's waterproof. Doesn't run. Congratulations. You can cry all you want now. You know, Karin… may I call you Karin? What's happening is nothing unusual, and certainly nothing to make me weep. This is not the first time and certainly not, I'm sorry, certainly not the last time my husband will have an affair. You might've noticed… I'm a gimp. I'd be naive to think he'd be faithful. It was a pleasure. My husband and I have a deal… And I'd like to make a deal with you. If you want to keep seeing my husband, then turn around and listen to what I have to say. You're crazy about him, right? And I understand. But you must have noticed as well, that the political situation in the country is not ideal. My friends have been fighting for freedom for years. I help them every now and then. Of course, nice and quiet, I don't want to hurt Richard. But the time has come, we all have to take a risk. And we need your help. Your husband is in Leopoldov Prison. We lost our messenger there. We need you. Hm, that may not work. I don't go visit my ex-husband anymore. As far as I know, you're not divorced yet. And I also know you haven't visited him at all. I'm sure he'd love to see you. All you need to do is tell him you have a message for Dr. Čierny. Oh sure, and I end up behind bars with him. Karin, if I wanted revenge, you'd have been fired from the TV station a long time ago. This is not a trap. You could also sell me out anytime you want. Think of it as a business deal. If you help us, I'll get out of your way. What if they catch me? You're smart. And if it becomes necessary, Richard will take care of it through his friends. Richard knows about this? All you have to do is tell your husband, to pass the message to the man in the library. It's inside the cover. Keep the mascara. Everybody get up! Now! Come on! Come on! Get up! Up! Now! Move! Fuck! Move! Come on! Come on! Who got this for you?! I repeat! Who got this for you?! OK, move! -Next! -Move it! What's that? Last time you said you didn't have any bacon. That's between you and guard Juracek. This is not right! See, you are having an allergic reaction to it, and you are not even close to it! You'd die if you put it in your mouth. He is two tickets short. But this is all Gujda gave me. I don't give a shit! Tell him two more tickets. He'll punch my face if I don't get his stuff. I forgot, you owe me two from the last time. Hey! You hear?! Give it back to him! You deaf? Ziga, don't make problems. Give him back the tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. Next. Do you know who we're building this Socialism for? Our kids! Those brats don't deserve anything else. Are you coming? Go! -What are you doing here? -I need to talk. -Is something wrong? -Yes. -I'm tired, we're shooting in the morning. -I'll drive you home. I told you it wasn't my idea. Come on, Karin! What are you doing!? You crazy?! I'm sorry. I'm such a shitty driver too. I had a motorbike. I crashed at the first corner, with Miriam sitting behind me. She was in a wheelchair for months. She can't have children. Pull over here. You mean to leave me alone? Pull over! Richard, I've got a bed, too. What should I do? We'll cope with one prison visit, right? And then we'll have some time just for ourselves. You're amazing. Go home, get some sleep. I'll find you at the TV station. Oh shit. Oh, not again. Is it stuck again? Ah, yes Mr. Labansky, again. OK, let me. Done. Say hello to your wife. I will. Get ready to start sneezing. Labanský's cat was all over me again. The lock was stuck again. And that little sneak heard me. Sure he did. You can always trust state spies to be listening. I'm tired. Some nice wine will cheer you up. I could get Skutecký's painting at a reasonable price. You're really driving me nuts with this. I've told you many times: I don't want anything there except my grandfather's portrait. Yes, I know, I know, I know. Martha says hi, and she's grateful for your support. You met up with her again? I told you not to meet her in public. In your condition, you can't risk being taken in for interrogation. She's got news from Havel. It won't take much longer. From Havel? Was she specific? The government is losing control in Prague. And it's not only here. You know what's happening in Poland, in Germany? I guess there's something to it. I heard a great joke. Do you know who are we building this socialism for? The moment things start happening in Prague, we're packing and going there. That's Marta's advice? I'm not relying on Čiernys. They keep all the information to themselves. But I've cracked that message for Jozef. It's assembled from Bible quotations. You're such a bitch, darling. But well informed. It was great that I could help Martha. Assuming the Lupkova girl doesn't change her mind. No, she won't. This is Make-up. I need to meet. Where did you meet? I told you already. Did anyone see you? No. What exactly did she tell you? Will you finally arrest her? Leave it to us, Karin. You deliver the message exactly as Kelemenová asked you to. But that's illegal! When can you go to visit your husband? What if they find it when they search me? There won't be any problems. Hide the message in the spine of a book, and don't worry about the rest. Shouldn't send him a saw-file, too? And while visiting your husband, could you finally find out, where he hid those stolen paintings? You don't give a fuck about it! Don't make me think you're useless. Hey, quiet! Quiet! You look gorgeous. I look terrible. The car wouldn't start. I took the bus. It really stinks in here! You look OK. I work out all the time That's all you can do here. I'm sorry I wasn't in touch. I couldn't cope. You think I can cope? Especially when I got the divorce papers. Is that still on? I need more time, OK? Don't cry. It's all my fault. -I should've quit a long time ago. -I know, you were doing it for us. A lot of things have changed. I want to do something for us now. But I need your help. Something for you to read. Are you kidding me? There's a message. Put it away! Give it to the guy working in the library. -Put it away! -It's for Doctor Čierny. I'm supposed to do eleven years. If they find out, I'll get ten more and you too! -Drahoš, they promised me. -Who promised you? And that's what pisses me off about you, You're always interrupting me! So that's why you're here? Do it, and I'll be coming more often. She didn't stay very long. Forbidden love. Those faggots in your cell will like that! Listen! Drahoš, Drahoš. How could she bring you a secret message? Someone's using her, for sure, as always. And she told you to give it to yourself? I don't understand it. I don't know, it's driving me crazy! Maybe I should just quit. Are you nuts? -We're in! -What's going on, lovebirds? He's done protecting you. Lupko, ready to move? He doesn't give a shit about you! I would never do that to my people. What's going to happen with us? You'll be moved within one month. I promise. What do you say kid? You like it here, right? Not a bad company, fine people, right? Prisoner Gujda, stop these remarks! Boys, you'll get a cock in your mouth within a month. I promise! Look at the ink… total shit. Looks like an owl, its supposed to be a wolf! Fuck me! Re-do it! You get him? He made an owl out of it. Get the fuck out of here, if you don't have cash. And I don't take the blue coupons. Guards' wives don't fancy eating canned stuff anymore. You know? But I have cash. Bullshit! Two vodkas, two boxes of smokes. OK! This is one box, I paid for two! Prices went up. Take it or leave it. But this is for the Wolf. And if the Wolf expects two cartons, he should get two. Right? For the sake of your health. Fuck, Shit! Fuck! What is this? What is it? Bullshit questions! It's vodka. No, no, no, no! This is my mark! I scratched it in before the raid. When they took everything. And you, fuck-face, you want to resell it to me?! Wait, I have nothing to do with that. -I sell what they bring me. -Yeah? And I've nothing to do with the raids! I would never fuck Gujda over. I am not suicidal. Wait a moment! Wait. Look, one more, OK? And here, this is on the house. Delivery from the infirmary will be tomorrow. Please let Zigo know. OK, listen, you have two days to get the pills. At least ten boxes. And then we'll see. But you keep this to yourself. You'll take care of that! What's going on? Prisoner Sedmohradský. Prisoner Malatinský. Prisoner Čierny. Havel for President! Havel for President! None of us has been free for forty years! This country was one large prison surrounded by barbed wire. But today, we are tearing down our shackles! However, let us not forget our prisons are still full of real prisoners, condemned by the communist judiciary! It is our responsibility to demand immediate release of political prisoners and everyone else who has been wrongfully imprisoned. Freedom for everyone! Freedom! Freedom! Thank you, Miriam, well written. Thank you, Karel. -Is that the declaration? -Yes, it's great. Gorbachev won't invade with tanks. We have a tremendous opportunity to seize power. Financial institutions are the key! You're right. Those who control the money will have power. What are you talking about? The strike has barely started and you're already distributing wealth? I'm so proud of you. We've received over a hundred letters. You could read a few of them, some are emotional. Gladly, just make sure someone drives my wife home. But I'm not tired. Don't strain yourself too much, Miro will drive you. No, he doesn't have to. We all have our limits. Even a superwoman like yourself. Bye! Katka, please. Friends! We've received thousands of letters from all around Slovakia. I would like to read one of them to you. It was written by Mrs… [speakig to the crowd] Good morning Mrs. Kelemenová. Good morning. So, how do you feel about the demonstrations? Your husband makes a very robust impression on the podium. There's no stopping it. Aren't you afraid, Mr. Labanský? Why? I'm just a regular civil servant. Oh, come on. Significant changes will take place, but I don't expect anything dramatic. After all, we're a peaceful nation. Maybe they'll lock you up. And we'll get the house back. You have to admit, though, I'm taking pretty good care of it here. Without me, this would just be weeds and dead bushes. I adore this garden. …to solve the current situation through dialogue. Above all, they demanded the release of all political prisoners. Today, well-known dissident Dr. Jozef Čierny was released from Leopoldov Prison following intense pressure from the public. He was serving a sentence for the dissemination of forbidden religious literature and organizing anti-government demonstrations. Dr. Čierny, may I ask you a couple of questions? Of course, go ahead. What do you say about the latest events? I believe that hope is coming back to this country. Prepare to go to the cells! Hey, you got no right to do that! We have our rights! Exactly! What's going on in here? What's all this hollering? Quiet! No one has yet canceled your sentences, nor the rules of this prison. Until there are new orders, you obey the old system. There's no old system no more! But we're responsible for you. Select a representative who will deliver your demands to me. Or I won't talk to you. Let it be Gujda. Forget it. How about Lupko? That would be better. Lieutenant, just turn on the TV. We have the right to information. Twenty minutes. Sit down. Sit down! Turn it on. We have a lot of work ahead of us. These are turbulent times, we must not miss anything. The Communists are trying to make a deal already. They have formulated their requests, in return for electing a new president. But the VPN refuses to communicate with them. I don't know what they want. They will also contact you. Right now, it's just necesssary to resist temptation. The presidential office is not the most important position we need to win now. We need to establish a political party that will fight the elections, as soon as possible. The Christian public is in our favor. And we will need a strong prime minister. Actually, I haven't asked you… Are you still interested in defending our values? You don't have to doubt that at all, Excellency. Then we should set up a meeting at the Vatican as soon as possible. Ouch! Are you out of your mind? Why are you plucking me like a goose? What the fuck is that?! Show me. A recipe from a magazine on how to keep a man? What are you doing? Stop it. Listen Teddy Bear, I was thinking, what would you say if we bought… I saw a fleece carpet in the store for 2500. Karinka, I'm not five! Why are you calling me Teddy Bear? Because I love you, Teddy Bear. Love is a much-overrated commodity. Wait. Where are you going? I have to stop by at the VPN. And then? Then I'm going home. Mademoiselle Dissident has nothing else to do? Still checking what time you get home? You know we have a deal with Miriam. She needs help in the morning. I'm trying to keep that deal. So you are a perfect husband now. Doesn't bother you to have a mistress? Not for now. Don't start fooling yourself about something I never promised you. Come on! We're having a good time. Don't spoil it. Try living for today. Bye. Are you hungry, Lupko? My wife made them. Have one. What is in yours? Salami. You want to swap for Debrecen ham? My mum used to make these for me when I was competing. And how long have you been doing karate? Since elementary school, but I started to really enjoy it when I was in the paratroopers. That wasn't mentioned in your file. Really? No; I would have noticed. I was in the paratroopers too. Really? The famous Major Demáček, you ever run into him? You bet. He was a jerk. Why did you start to steal, Lupko? I was planning to escape to South Africa with my wife. There's Apartheid there. There's something everywhere. Finished, Mr. Čierny. Are we done? Thank you. Shall we have one more? Richard, maybe we should summarize our goal in this talk. I believe we have the same goal, Jozef. Dr. Čierny! Yes. We meet in person at last. My friend. Nice to meet you. My dear librarian. We should be going, Jozef. This is Richard Kelemen. But in fact you know each other. Drahoslav Lupko. Excuse me, to the studio, please. -We have to start. -Yes, yes. We must talk after the discussion. Lupko, go to the studio. Go, we'll wait for you here. It's as though our mass media has been waging war on us over recent weeks! All they want is conflict. Representatives of Public Against Violence already visited several correctional facilities, they were able to see whether the conditions are as appalling as is constantly reported. Ugh! Shame! Quiet! Director Bachleda is right, I admit we've been allowed onto the premises. The prisoners literally worshipped us, and the prison staff was really helpful. But we weren't allowed inside to see the conditions in which prisoners like Dr. Čierny had been serving their sentences. The representative of prisoners from the Leopoldov correction institute is asking to comment on this. Go ahead Mr. Drahoslav Lupko. Thank you, I… I am serving my sentence in Hey look, Karate Kid is swallowing, he's scared already. That's useless! You have to attack! You have to push through! I am serving my sentence in the prison where thousands of innocent people suffered in inhuman conditions under Communism. We all know about this. All of us. But until now no one was able to speak about it. But we can't compare the 1950s with the present. Oh, come on. That wasn't only during the '50s. Ugh! Fucking fat pig. Let me give you an example. You had our cells painted. The problem is you did it on 16th December, in the coldest weather. The heating was off for days. We had to open the windows. Good, well said, at least something. Many of us spent Christmas in bed with a fever. Several inmates suffered from pneumonia. For 40 years Czechoslovakia only showed its successful side. It's time to show the other side of the coin. Perhaps it would be better if we avoided specifics. We cannot verify if these claims are true. Ask Dr. Čierny if you don't believe me. Leopoldov is a cesspool that must be cleaned up as soon as possible! As Dostoyevsky said, and Churchill copied it from him: If you want to know what condition a state is in, look at its prisons. In Leopoldov, you don't know when or why someone starts to dislike you. Am I right Mr. Director? You've got totally defenseless people mixed with the worst kind of murderers there. The amnesty the new president will certainly grant is precisely what our country urgently needs to return to the family of civilized nations. We all need to get a second chance. Drahoš, now the time is right. Keep writing declarations and complaints, communicate with the media, build up the pressure. If necessary, start a hunger strike. That will be a strong argument for prison reforms. Do you understand? With the new president, amnesties will surely be granted. I don't know how wide, so be realistic, but ask for the impossible! What if it doesn't work out? I assume I'll become the Interior Minister in the new government. Then I'll have sufficient leverage to get you out. Do you understand? We'll keep in touch. God bless you. Lieutenant, my wife is here, can I? Go ahead. Karin! Karin! What do you think? About what? About the discussion. I didn't watch. Are you OK? Sure, I'm fine. Will you come see me for Christmas? Drahoš, you know what would be best? It would be best if you signed the divorce papers as soon as possible. Merry Christmas! Is there someone else? -I am asking you, is there someone else? -Yes. There's someone else! Who is it? What? Who is it? Who is it? I am asking you, who is it? You're no match for him! You loser! You loser! So, you figured out yet the real reason you're doing time? Huh? Got it straight in your dumb head? Who turned you in? I turned you in. I did it! You understand? Me! Watch out, it's icy. Thank you. Good evening Mr. Čierny. That guy. How long has he been living here? Labansky? I hope not much longer. Darling, why are you whispering? I still can't get used to it. On the other hand, he's taking good care of the garden, which suits me fine. Let's not spoil the evening with that squealer. The new parliament will certainly discuss a bill on restitution. I believe it won't be long before you get the whole house back again, Miriam. The portrait of my grandfather should go back there. He was very good friends with Josef Čapek. We were only able to keep this part of the house because my father bribed some guy called Bystrický with the painting. He was a keen collector of bourgeois art. Bystrička? Hm. Wasn't his name Bystrický? It's known that he collects paintings. No, Richard. We'll fall down outside, ice or not. By the way, do you know who robbed Bystrický's villa? No? No. Lupko. Really? He wrote to me about it in prison. Imagine: Bystricky was there in person when they interrogated Lupko. He wanted them to beat out of him where he'd hidden the paintings. And where are they? Who? The paintings. I can assure you, Miriam, only Lupko himself knows that. What are you thinking about? Let's have dessert and coffee. And how are things in Prague? Is Václav still a clear choice? Everybody loves Havel. But he is more of a rock star than a politician. How is Dubček coping with that? He's disappointed for sure. He thought he was guaranteed the job. He'll only get the position of the Federal Assembly speaker. Isn't it a bit unfair? People don't want to look back anymore. Havel has captivated them, and they don't care that he has no experience of government. I think he's a dangerous idealist. They make a martyr out of him because he was in prison? Ridiculous. That's going a little too far. I've liked Václav since the very first moment Miriam introduced us. Anyway, the Czechs wouldn't accept another Slovak president. Even Husák prefers to speak Czech so as not to provoke them. But your Czech also sounds ridiculous on TV. I don't find Havel very fitting. He's too liberal. We need someone with firmer Christian values. We'll see how long this coexistence of ours will last. I hope you don't want to split up Czechoslovakia?! No, of course not. But property that was confiscated from the Church will need to be returned. And that's where our view is starkly different from that of the Czechs. Richard, I have to tell you: your recent public appearances were quite impressive. Thank you, Jozef. It would be good to have someone from our ranks at Václav's side. He'll soon assume the presidency and he'll need an eloquent speaker for sure. And with your voice… Right? Any journalistic busybody can be the speaker. Richard is fit for a much more significant position. I'll do what I can for Richard, but he'll need to quit his job at the theatre immediately and go with me to Prague. So we'll go to Prague. Cognac? Tourists like to say that nature is the biggest gym in the world. Attractive in every season, offers lots of possibilities for organizing different games and competitions. Hey, Academic, good job! Looks just like him. But the 12-year-old you're doing time for would make a better model than this one with the moustache, hmm? I'm innocent. As are all of us. Hey, you two! Go take down that old prick. We'll make room for the new one. C'mon, what's up? Chicken shits! Give it to me. It's OK if I hang it there, right? Step back! Quiet here! Quiet! Boys, you've got no balls. But that's all right, some prisoners without balls even get sent to speak in the telly. But you said Lupko did well. He was too soft with those faggots. He should've kicked their asses and laid down demands. There. You don't look good. There's talk about your wife. You have any idea when'll they move us? I can't take it anymore with that wacko. Hromžík can't make any transfers now. Orders from on high. But I spoke to Čierny. He's got a proposal for us. What proposal? We're supposed to put down our demands. If they hesitate with the amnesty in Prague, we should immediately go on a hunger strike. Hunger strike? We need to be more in the media, TV and radio. We must not let them forget about us. No one's gonna join your hunger strike at Christmas. Alright, maybe we just have to persuade one. …don't be a fool, it's only me… It smells great! He really is a good cook. You bet. Vaclav is smaller. Take the dumplings, let's go. So, friends, the specialty of Vaclav's family. There's also some cranberries and a rose-hip jam to go with it. You can choose. What meat is it made of? I shot a boar. So, it ended up as Ceausescu. That totally ruined my appetite. There are over a thousand dead in Bucharest. Where is Václav anyway? He'll join us a little later than planned, because of the situation in Romania. The goulash is still hot, shall we wait for him? Sure. We can be glad our revolution happened so peacefully. It could've ended up like that. That's true. Karel, you're the closest to Václav. Is it true he's serious about a general amnesty? Have you thought about what's going to happen? Inmates will be leaving prisons with no inspection, no evaluation, no money. Will they have a place to stay? No one's going to employ them. Revisiting files, reopening cases, that would take years. Let's just not release them all at once! Václav will do what he has to do, he doesn't need the approval of any of us. It's going to be a mess anyway. If he issues an amnesty, everyone will hate him because crime will increase. And if he doesn't, then what? The inmates will set the prisons on fire and we'll have to explain to the whole world why we messed up. But after the general amnesty of 1960 crime did not increase at all. Quite the opposite. But those were different times. Thanks to rock 'n' roll and hippies. People will understand when a general amnesty is issued by someone who was a political prisoner himself. Please, stop it now. You all know Václav, he was given a second chance, he wants to extend it to others now. I know Václav as well, and he would not let the stew get cold. Gentlemen. Cheers! Dammit, guys! Does anyone want to go to confession? You keep demanding better conditions. So I get you a priest, and you totally ignore it. I'm asking for the last time - dammit, anyone wants to go to confession? Forgive me, Father. Gujda, stop fooling around. I'm not foolin' 'round. I even got my confirmation. All right, Gujda will go to confession, the guards will stay. Everyone else back to cells. Dismissed! -Lieutenant. -Yes? I would like to take confession, too. All right. Lupko and Gujda, everyone else back to cells. Let's go. Move. You really want to talk to God, or you collecting points with the guards? I want to talk to you. Hm, I heard someone's about to go on a hunger strike. We have to remind them that we're here! The only way to get a general amnesty. Get it? It doesn't apply to me anyway. Maybe they'll at least shorten your sentence. The conditions in our cells will improve. Luxury Hotel? Forget it. I don't care about the Amnesty. Can we begin? Come, please. Sure, Father; the things I'm gonna tell you. Gujda, think about it. Hi, Dad! Sorry, I'm late. I did my best, but please don't look too closely at the schnitzels, OK? Why didn't you come sooner? I always come on St. Stephen's Day. Merry Christmas! Can you explain why the neighbor didn't say hello this time? I slapped her son. What for? No one's going to call me a squealer. Especially not some snotty kid. Lots of people think ex-soldiers are automatically informers. Don't get upset. What are you doing? I took it out. Just in case. Can't you see what's going on? How about you get rid of it? Are you nuts? I've been hiding it from the communists for Forty years and now I throw it away? It's from World War II. Collectors in Austria would pay a fortune for it. I'm going to church tonight. You can come with me if you want. Sure, sure I'll go with you just because it's trendy these days. Have you at least been to Mom's grave? It's appropriate. At least at Christmas. Since when do you tell me what's appropriate? Where did you get those earrings? Who bought them? You want to tell me you got them from the guy in prison? Shut the windows, it's not summer yet! Because it stinks in here! You didn't finish about the earrings. Put it up there. My back aches. Well, enjoy the meal. Bon appetite Harken to me, I'm bringing you news Hear it in earnest, unerringly muse… [singing christmas carol] It doesn't bother you that Christmas was four days ago? No. I have to tell you a secret! Yes? Jesus doesn't exist. Of course, he does, you just have to believe! And you? What do you believe in? -Me? -I'll be glad to hear it. I'll tell you what I believe in. Well, something is holding it all together! -Škrečok, are you a believer? -No. I don't believe in anything anymore. Do you hear him? He doesn't believe in anything. Look at him. He is small, disgusting, ugly. As if he was pulled out of an ass. Life was cruel to you, I know. We'll give you holy water, and you'll be better. Leave him! Fuck off and stop barking here! You're killing me! Been barking here for the last three years! Who can listen to it? Someone is dead, something's happened. Where is it coming from? Drahoš! Tibor? Drahoš! Drahoš! Tibor! What's going on? Drahoš! In our country there are many prisoners who, though they may have committed serious crimes, and have been punished for them, have had to submit despite the goodwill of some investigators, judges and above all defense lawyers to a debased judiciary process that curtailed their rights. They now have to live in prisons that do not strive to awaken the better qualities contained in every person, but rather humiliate them and destroy them physically and mentally. Given this fact, I have decided to declare a relatively extensive amnesty. At the same time, I call on the prisoners to understand that forty years of unjust investigations, trials and imprisonments cannot be put right overnight, and to realize that the changes that are being speedily prepared still require time to implement. RELEASE PROTOCOL Inmates at the Leopoldov Prison went on a hunger strike. Most convicts refused to go to work, causing a significant loss to the national economy. Sir, at the moment, I am acting on behalf of Director Bachleda, and I can't reach him. -He is in the factory in Zlaté Moravce. -What is he doing there? You have a hunger strike at your facility! The situation in Calex is extremely complicated. I'm asking you again: what's he got to do with that? I assume you're aware the production was halted at various state companies. Bring me Lupko! Yes, sir! Before the amnesty, these companies depended on labor force provided by correctional institutions. They've stopped production in Calex, Matadorka and Makyta Púchov because of us. Is that a joke? They can't mannage without you? Open the gate! Calm down! Come here, come eat it up! -Hi! -Hi! I wouldn't go there. Open up section four! Stop it! Lieutenant, I am starving! I want some halászlé! Are you going to do anything? This is horrible! I am not on a hunger strike with them! I want to get out of here! Good afternoon, gentlemen. Well, what do we have here? Dr. Gujda has the right cure for hunger. Do you have money? What's the deal here? Where are you taking him? None of your business! Who are you talking to, boy? Hey, give me the cap back! It's mine now. He is the boss here. Give me back-- Let's go! Sir, but you don't understand me, this is impossible, nobody knows what to do here. Drahoš Lupko is standing in front of me, I'll put him on the line. Good afternoon, Minister. Drahoš, what on earth are you doing there? The hunger strike was supposed to be the way to achieve an amnesty. That already took place, so why the circus now? And why are you only calling now, eight days into the hunger strike? Drahoš, yours is not the only prison where things are hot. We're doing what we can. Anyway, I'm willing to negotiate so the prisoners see that things are moving. It's been three months since the amnesty, and no one's paying any attention to us. The amnesty hasn't turned out the way the President imagined. No, the amnesty is alright. It's your politics that stinks! At this moment, you're not popular with the public. Be realistic and ask only for that which is possible! Stop the hunger strike! What do I have to do with the hunger strike? Am I the only one on it? And besides, it was you who wanted the hunger strike, my dear friend. Lupko, you hang up on the minister. So, he put you up to this hunger strike? Commander, this is it! A riot! Quiet! We have guests! You got another amnesty for us? Gujda, stop fucking around! You know what's next! Of course I do, otherwise we wouldn't be doin' it! Finally, the lords at the castle will take notice. I'm ordering you for the last time, end the riot, otherwise, we'll have to use force. You can't scare us anymore with your batons. The Director doesn't want to lose his job, and you, handsome, don't want to lose your rank! OK, OK. What are your terms? We need our spokesman. Come here Lupko! Come on! You don't have to go there. Drahoš, why did you come back? Let's get out of here! Monitor the situation! You two, come with me! …therefore the Ministry of the Interior of the Czechoslovak Republic is warning citizens of the nearby towns and villages to avoid the Leopoldov correctional institute. How is it possible that the prisoners had weapons? To what extent did the cancellation of personal searches throughout Czechoslovakia contribute to this situation? The following report will try to answer these questions. Well, that Havel got us into real trouble now. Everyone's scared to go outside. My God, Karin, I'm sorry, I forgot. Your husband, has he been released too, or is he still there? Hello? Good afternoon, this is Karin from VPN. Is Mr. Kelemen in the office? Mr. Kelemen? Yes? -Somebody from VPN. -Put them through. Yes, I am listening. Hi, it's me. Karin? What's going on? I'm swamped. You don't give a damn about me as usual. You really want to make a scene? I'm dealing with Leopoldov. Why do you think I'm calling you? Is he involved? I don't know. We don't have enough information. You don't have to worry. He'll get at least a couple more years if he is involved. What if he escapes? Richard, you know very well Drahoš is dangerous. It would be best if he stays where he is. We must prepare, he won't be there forever. Make sure he stays locked up as long as possible! I have to go. Wait! Are you still coming to Bratislava at the end of the month? Looks like it. I'll let you know. And Richard-- Jerk. Mrs. Adamcová, don't put that lady through again. OK? Are we really going to Bratislava at the end of the month? I'm just asking so that I can make plans. It's time to end it. No, no, no, don't hurry! You said you didn't have enough information from Leopoldov. Why don't you go there so you can give the president first-hand reports? And while at it, you can protect Lupko. What do you mean? If you really want to get rid of her, set her husband free and he'll get it done. More importantly, Lupko has something much more precious than his beloved wife. If you're talking about those paintings, it's not even sure he's got them. Do you remember what Čierny said? Lupko robbed the Bystrický villa. Čapek was among the stolen things, Lupko has to have it. That painting is worth millions. Even if he has it, you think he's going to give it to you? Give it to me? It's mine! If Lupko survives the riot, and you can help him do so… I'll get it back from him, I can guarantee you that. I'm afraid he might beat the shit out of me! That's the risk of being a womanizer, my dear. But I don't think he'd risk life in prison for you. Mrs. Adamcová, I want to talk to Minister Čierny! Call his office immediately! Don't let them turn you down. Go get the blowtorch! I'll keep them busy in the meantime. Guys, you know me, I'm a good guy and a democrat, I'm not forcing anyone. So, those of you who want to have a go at the guards, come with me! Those who are afraid, invalids and faggots, can stay here, nice and warm. Look at that, Karate Kid got scared? Really? Of what? This is suicide. You are just diving deeper into shit! Take him out. My pleasure. What I've seen is that you made an excellent show on TV. I wanted to do something about our rights. No, no, no. You're trying to take me out. You're just looking for a way to become the king here. This is my world, bro. Tie him up and take him! Hey, hey! Wait! Gujda! Open up! Weld it fucking shut! Keep him alive Žiga, we will need him later! Ziga! Get the infirmary! Guys, we're going to the kitchen for a reward. Isn't that the actor? Get out of here. This way, please. The prisoners have taken barracks A and B, as well as the workshop, where they had presumably made the weapons recently. After the amnesty, we did not carry out in-depth checks, we didn't have clear orders. Mr. Bachleda, don't defend yourself, there's no time for that now. They have seized the food storage. It would be tough to starve them out. They also broke into the infirmary and are under the influence. Do all prisoners participate? We don't know. They might be holding some as hostages. Who is their leader? We don't know, their spokesman is Drahoslav Lupko. Do you think this spokesman is involved with the riot? Third-degree prisoner Gujda, controls a large portion of the inmates. Who is this Gujda anyway? He's inside for double homicide, they couldn't prove the other two. He controls most of them and proclaimed himself king of the prisoners. No one can say the conditions haven't improved in here. Some guys just started roasting a pig on the roof. What is it? What are you staring at dickheads? Now I'll show you our spokesman! Enough, gentlemen! We're not going to watch that bare-assed idiot make fun of us. Prepare an operational plan as quickly as possible. I want to be briefed in one hour! Well, if anyone took pictures of this… Wow! I hope you didn't admit any journalists, Minister. As far as I know, your job is only to report to the President. Stop interfering! Now call Václav, the special unit will have to intervene. YOU SCREWED US! "WE WANT A SECOND CHANCE!" “AMNESTY FOR ALL!” And what about those downstairs? Will we feed them? Those cowards will not get any! I'll burn the wimps down. I'll burn it all here! Set the fires! Fucking assholes! Good evening Karin. I brought some cakes from Prague. May I? Thank you. A punch one or a chocolate one? Is Richard in Bratislava? Yes and no. We came together, but he went on to Leopoldov with the Minister. I'll give you a punch one, it's excellent. Why did he go there? Among other things, because of your Drahoš. Is that the regular domestic rum? I've never had it. May I try some? Richard and I agreed you deserve a reward. You took a risk and really helped us. We can arrange a decent position at the TV's Artistic Department for you. Here in Bratislava. Go to hell with your position! Do you know what the difference between you and me is? I can accept the bitter reality as it is. It's a pity you did not realize what your role was. You could have made much better use of it. It's over with Richard. I think you know that. I knew he was a coward, but sending his wife instead of coming himself… Get the fuck out! By the way, I read your State Security file. It's really disgusting. Fuck! Wake the men. And fetch Lupko! Do I understand correctly, we are using the unit that was beating up students in Prague in November? They are the best! Lieutenant Hromžík will enter the prison blocks with the special unit, his task is to navigate. We already started pumping nitrogen into the sewers. Just in case they want to plant explosives there. Where would they get explosives? We have to prepare for every contingency. We have armored transporters and a helicopter. The snipers are in position. Minister, you will get a radio so that we stay in contact. The captain will explain it. Got a second? Of course. Perhaps you don't know, but Lupko risked a lot to help Minister Čierny when he was in prison here. I'll do what I can, but who knows whether he's still alive. If you manage to save him, you can expect a significant promotion. It's the minister's authority to appoint the new director. I have to go. Of course, of course. What were you stuffing his head with, Richard? I just reminded him that the President expressly asked for the intervention to be as humane as possible. Of course. Lieutenant, you'll go with them. If there's anything out of the ordinary, alert me. Understood. Unit forward! Let's go! This way we'll go through the basement. Hello Mr. Lupko, nice to see you. How's it going with the bomb? I'm working on it. He'll speak for the prisoners one last time. Sit him down on the edge of the roof! Paratroopers aren't afraid of heights. Václav did not want things to end up this way. He's not responsible for the sick aggression of some individuals, nor for the incompetent people who messed up here. The amnesty ended up as it did. We can discuss the reasons at a more appropriate time. Now, tell me frankly, how much do you really care about Lupko? You should be grateful to him. Did you forget how he was helping you? “WHO IS BURNING FOR THE TRUTH?” Stop the attack, right now! Are you and Miriam still searching for that painting by Čapek? Stop it! She thinks I'm just a rag she can wipe her ass with? I know too much! You really want to ruin your life? Why didn't you accept her offer? The papers will love information from a Christian politician's bedroom. They're perverts! At first, I wondered why you were so reckless and called me. But now, I know. You're simply stupid. What would the papers say to the story of a woman who turned her husband in and got him to jail for a long time so that she could happily fuck a married actor, whose wife is disabled? You still want to act smart, with your story? Now, go crawl under the nearest rock, and don't crawl back out for the next two or three years until things calm down again. I'll say you raped me! Of course, Of course, Karin. I always raped you after handing you the envelope full of money. We have recordings of everything. I'm sorry, you can't milk it. Let me give you a piece of advice. There will be many many more opportunities now than before November. I'm moving to Prague, I started my own business. And you should do the same. Now get lost! Fuck, what happened? Rigo exploded. Kill the fire! Don't just stand there, help him! Rigo! Rigo! Fuck! -Hello. -Hi. You look terrible, are you sick? Bad day. What, something with Richard? You know something? I heard something. What did you hear? What did you hear? Who from? Stop it! Stop talking bullshit! That's exactly what everyone would love. If I just shut up and obey. Burn everything to the ground! Fucking place! Unleash the Kraken! Minister, the situation is getting out of control, we have to act! If you dump Lupko, the paintings are lost. Richard shut up! It's not about your painting anymore. General, this is Čierny. Commence the operation! Run! All of you run down! Don't let them go up the stairs! You're gonna be the second Palach! You're gonna be famous! Gujda! What are you doing here? The two of us discussed everything. Put it down! Do you understand? Put it down! "LONG LIVE HAVEL" One year has passed. And today, we all stand here a little puzzled. We all know very well there is a lot to be done, and we are asking ourselves the question why is our common goal so difficult to achieve, whether we have underestimated the legacy of the old regime, or have overestimated ourselves; whether someone is purposefully hindering and ruining our everyday work, or whether we are destroying it ourselves. And quite rightfully, today we ask: Why haven't we succeeded, over a period of an entire year, in achieving that which had initially appeared to be the easiest, namely investigating all the circumstances of last year's massacre and punishing its actual perpetrators? Why have we not enabled true justice to fully take place in a dignified and legal way? Why is our political climate being poisoned by demagogy, as well as political, nationalistic, and racial intolerance? Why, after we have overthrown such an inhumane regime in such a humane way, is the crime rate rising so steeply? For each of these and similar questions, there exists a number of practical answers and explanations. Nevertheless, they do not change anything about the fundamental fact that dissatisfaction, nervousness, uncertainty, impatience, and disillusionment are spreading quickly in our society. It is understandable, and it could even be good for something: it is exactly this impatience that can exert pressure, which will in turn compel societal changes to take place faster and more resolutely. I am not worried too much about the nervousness and impatience itself. What I consider to be much worse, however, is what is accompanying it: animosity, malevolence, jealousy, mutual slander, envy, and overinflated ambition. Today, let each of us try to reflect on ourselves. Let us try to reflect on our public life, to think calmly and with grace in the light of his own conscience. Let us try to reflect with a broader perspective, from a universal point of view, so to speak, and try to realize how our actions, sometimes provincial in manner, may appear to the free world.
