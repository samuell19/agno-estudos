[♪♪♪] CONDUCTOR: All aboard, please. Sorry for the delay, folks. All aboard. Right this way. Watch your step. How much for this one? The price is on the bottom. Not on this one. Oh, let me see it. This one is 5.95. [DOOR BELL CHIMES] I can get it for 4 at home. [DOOR BELL CHIMES] [DOOR BELL CHIMES] I saw you steal that magazine. I must be losing my touch. That's funny. Everyone out here knows me. I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble. Lucky you. CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Will you put that out, please? No. My brother's gonna be here soon. Claire, I'll put it out when he gets here. Shit! What? I left my cat is on the train. Somebody will find her. Come on, let's call Amtrak from the ranch. Come on. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ON CAR STEREO] I hope nobody steals my cat. Well, we're in the country. They're good people here. You'll get it back. You think so? Yeah. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] Sam, we're trying to listen to the car radio. Check you out. [BOOMBOX SHUTS OFF] Michael, are you gonna come visit us while we're here? I'm gonna keep an eye on you, if that's what you're asking. No, I mean you should just come by one night, like, to visit. Bring some of your friends along. From what I hear, you girls need to spend a little time with each other. What do you mean? Hear from who? What, is it some kind of a big secret or something? You know something we don't know? Well, it's no big deal. Mom thought you were spending too much time alone. That's why she arranged for you to have this outing with Jennifer and Sam. [SIGHS] [BIRDS CAWING] [♪♪♪] Okay, this should be enough food for a week. My number's right here by the phone. I've fed the horses already, but I need you to feed them again around noon tomorrow, okay? CLAIRE: All right. MICHAEL: So call me if you need anything. Don't do anything stupid. Oh, by the way, Sam... you're dripping. [DOOR CLOSES] SAM: Shit. CLAIRE: What is that? Hopefully just wine. [SIGHS] Jennifer, why don't you take your stuff to your room? I've gotta call about my cat first. [CAR DRIVING AWAY] The number for Amtrak. Hold on. Fuck! This was one of my favorite t-shirts. I'll take if you don't want it. It'll look really good when it dries. I'll keep it. Go ahead. CLAIRE: Jennifer! It washes right off. [SIGHS] What's in the jar?Booze. What kind? Well, it's all different kinds. I take a little from every bottle in my dad's bar. That way he won't notice it's missing. Do you have any glasses? Yeah, in the cupboard. Oh, how sweet! Michael left you a housewarming present, Claire. That's not like him. Hey, can I take any room I want? CLAIRE: Yeah. I lost my cat. Yeah, she's a white Persian with this pink, little rhinestone collar on her-- Okay, the number here is 450-4247. Please call me as soon as you find her. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. SAM: Someone left his shit in this room. [♪♪♪] They could be Michael's. They're his size. He's a slob. He didn't used to be. Well, he is now. I'm not sleeping in this bed. Then take another room. [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] [SHIVERING] [DOOR OPENS] [HORSES WHINNYING] [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] [WINCES] [SCREAMS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ON TV] SAM: You don't have to call and check up on me every day. And that goes for Dad too. Tell her to tell my parents the same. SAM: Well, I'm fine. We're all fine. We're having a terrible time, Mom, don't worry. Bored silly. And I want to thank you for making me come up here. Really. Something happened out there. Mom-- Mom, I-- Okay. I gotta go. Don't call me, I'll call you. Okay? Bye. JENNIFER: He's cute. Is he dead? We should call an ambulance. Wait, he's moving. Bring him inside, I'll get the first-aid kit. Can you walk? [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SCOFFS] [JENNIFER SIGHS][SCOFFS] [WINCES] [GROANS SOFTLY] It's just blood. Be glad it ain't yours. [LIGHTER CLICKS] Ain't you supposed to offer me a smoke? [LIGHTER CLICKS] What happened out there? I was just riding my bicycle down the road when these two fucking dogs from I don't know where started chasing me, nipping at my feet, barking like wolves, howling. I tried to outride them, then I tried to kick them, but they just kept chasing me and chasing me. Fast little rats. Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, boom, I ran into a tree. Must have cut myself on the bike or something. What happened to the dogs? I don't know. That was weird, they just-- They came out of nowhere. I guess they had their fun and split. Eh, I'm soaked. You got anything I could change into? I can't stand the smell of dried blood. We have those clothes we found in the bedroom yesterday. Well, they wouldn't fit him. Why not? They were men's clothes. Maybe I could try 'em on? They're in back. What do you think? What? About him? Did you see the size of his thumbs? No, Jennifer, I didn't. [SIGHS] Not to mention his arms. I never met a guy with a tattoo before. Well, I meet guys like him down at the club all the time. I wonder what they're doing down there. Thanks. Do you mind? I'm kind of shy. Sorry. [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] Perfect fit. Looks like your leg is feeling better. Oh, yeah. Can I use the phone? Hey, it's me. Um, listen, I fucked up my bike and I got cut up real bad. I need you to come get me. You gotta. No, I know what we said. Just, you gotta come get me right now. Yeah. Right now. I'm-- I'm at... Where am I? 3312 Bellflower. 3312 Bellflower. Good. I'll be out of your way in no time. You aren't in our way. Where are you from? Chicago. Are you on spring vacation? [CHUCKLES] Look, um, I'm still a little dazed. Do you mind if I just lie down for a while till my friend got here? [DOOR CLOSES] We can't let him go right away. We should at least invite him to stay for dinner. We don't know anything about him. He's a boy and he's cute. Yeah, Claire, what else could we possibly need to know? Exactly. [KNOCKS] Yeah? How would you and your friend like to stay for dinner? Oh, thanks, but we gotta hit it. Maybe some other time, you know. Can we come in? Yeah, come in. What are you girls doing here anyway? We're on spring vacation. Oh, you all go to school together? Well, she and I do. Sam goes to private school. I was kicked out of public school. What grade are you two in? Twelfth. Tenth. She is in tenth. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Oh, my ride's here. Thanks for everything. Really, I mean it. Come on, let's go. Who are they? They came last night. I don't know. They're no one. Don't worry about them. You didn't tell me anyone was gonna see you get in my car. What fucking difference does it make? They could tell somebody I helped you escape. That's the difference it fucking makes. Ever hear about harboring a fugitive? Who they gonna tell? They ain't gonna tell anyone shit. Why take the chance they do? I'll pay for the fucking ride. [CHUCKLES] I knew you were gonna fuck me up, Jeff. I knew it. Now, what am I supposed to do, huh? Tell me. Hitchhike. Oh, God, come on. They'd sniff me out in a second! I can't show my face for a couple days. It's not my problem, man. Please don't do this to me. Please. Manny, you want a piece of advice? What? Go back in there to those, uh, cute girls and have some fun with them while you can. Because if you get caught, you're not gonna have any fun for a very long time. I knew you'd fuck me up. What happened? That dinner invitation still open? Sure. First, tell us what happened. We had a fight and he left me. CLAIRE: Why? I go out with his sister, and he saw you and he thought I was two-timing her. Well, call her and tell her you're not. No, I know, but she won't believe me. Besides, I mean, I was gonna dump her anyway. Now what the fuck am I gonna do? I got no money, no friends, no place to go. You could stay here. Really? Hey, look, I know how this must seem, but don't be scared of me. I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere. If you let me stay here for a while, I promise I'll make your vacation something to remember. Why don't you girls talk it over? I'm just gonna go back into one of these rooms. I vote yes. Well, I vote no, and it's my father's ranch. When we used to watch TV at my house, we still voted on what to watch. Don't be ridiculous, Jennifer. We haven't voted in years. Anyway, I don't believe a word he says, none of it. Why not? Did you see any dogs in the road? Did you hear them barking? I believe one thing that he said. What? That he'd make our vacation something to remember. I mean, come on, he's gotta be more fun than going riding or going out to the lake. No shit. Youwant to let him stay? Well, I figure if he was gonna kill us, he would've done it by now. Yeah. You promise not to tell our parents about this? Or Michael? Okay. [SIGHS] Thank you. Thank you. You made the right decision. You won't regret it. CLAIRE: How do you know? Because I know. Howdo you know? Because I'm entertaining. Prove it. [MANNY SNAPS FINGERS] [♪♪♪] Do you guys know there are goblins in this part of the country? Shh! Do you know what these are? What? These are goblin-getters. [YELLING] [EXHALES SHARPLY, THEN YELLS] I think they're all gone. [YELLS] [PANTING] I'm also... God, I hate to say this. I'm also an excellent cook. No, really. I was a short-order cook in a diner one summer. Best cook they ever had. They called me "Touch," because I knew exactly when to flip the burgers. Come on. How about a sandwich like you never had? No, thanks. What are you girls' name anyway? I'm Jennifer, and that's Claire, and that's Sam. I'm Manny. Where you girls from? Why do you keep saying "you girls"? I don't know, you're all from the same town, aren't you? We're from Brentwood. What's that? It's in L.A. Brentwood is part of Los Angeles, Jennifer. The rich part, huh? So you're best friends, or what? We haven't seen much of each other lately. So this is sort of a reunion? Our parents thought it'd be a good idea for us to spend some time together. We're supposedly a good influence on each other. I think they liked us better when we were younger. You girls been bad somehow? Claire, what you'd do? I got caught shoplifting a couple times. Hmm. What, and that makes you a real desperado in Brentwood? Mine don't like my boyfriend. Why not? I think because my mom's friends with his ex-wife. [CHUCKLES] And what about you? We told. [CLEARS THROAT] My parents think I spend too much time alone. What are you, a tube freak or...? I don't watch TV. What do you do? She sits in the basement and dissects animals. [SNICKERS] Ew. Dead or alive? [CHUCKLES]Dead. You kill 'em? I buy them dead. What about you? Why don't you tell us something about you? Manny Carrilla. Nothing else to tell, just that I'm at your service. From what you girls tell me, this should be a celebration. For what? For your freedom. I mean, look at you three. No parents, no school, no nothing. Believe me, girls, it's rare. Rare that you got nobody telling you what you gotta do, nobody to answer to. That calls for a party. A bash. We can do whatever the fuck we want to. Right! I'm fixing drinks! I'm gonna dance.

Okay. Excuse me. Go ahead, Jennifer. Tell him. What was that all about? [SIGHS] I have some bad news. What? Sam says you have to go. What? You have to leave, Sam says so. She's jealous. How come it's up to her? We voted, and Claire went along with her. You voted. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I wanted you to stay. [♪♪♪] Can I at least stay till dark?

Bullshit. She said she got sick of having you around. It's true. She's a bitch, what can I say? I'd like to fucking slug her. Just once, I'd like to, heh... [SIGHS] ...slug a bitch like her. So, what's stopping you? You're right. I should go back in there and bash her little face in. Check you out. Well, I already got her where it hurts. Where is that? Come on in, find out. As far as I'm concerned, you can stay. What about Claire? She's okay. I can talk her into it. You wanna stay? Yeah. Just...wait right here, one second. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Did you do this? This better come out, Sam. Or what? [DOOR SLAMS] What is he doing here? Who, him? He's staying. Why is her hair green? I don't know. Maybe she's turning green with envy. [DOOR SLAMS] You want a cigarette? Yeah. JENNIFER: Shit, shit, shit! MANNY:Thanks. Sorry I yelled at you before. It's all right. So, ladies, what are we gonna do today? There's riding or just walking around lake. Oh, that sounds a little too exciting. I got something we could stir things up with out there. You like stirring things up, Claire? No. Didn't think so. What do you like? Just cutting apart animals? I like figuring out how things work. Trying to figure me out? Well, don't try too hard. You might succeed. I might. Then what are you gonna do with me? Okay, let's go. I'm ready. Come on. I'd better stay here and keep an eye on Jennifer. Good thinking. See you. [DOOR CLOSES] What? Do you want some breakfast? [SCOFFS] No. Where's Sam? Outside with Manny. What is she so pissed about? She would've done the exact same thing last night if she had the chance. I know. I mean, she's doing it now. She's gotten so... Self-righteous? Yeah. Self-righteous. She's always been like that. You two have always fought over things. I usually hate girls like her, nasty punkettes. It looks fine. Whatever doesn't come out in the next wash, you can just cut it off. I have to go feed the horses. You wanna come? Sounds like a blast. So, what was it really like? What? Sex? Yeah. [HORSE SNORTS] I didn't do it with him. I didn't think so. Well, I'm not gonna waste my first time on him. I mean, who's Manny Carrilla anyway? [HORSE WHINNIES] What happened? It was weird. We were making out and stuff, and I was letting him feel me up. And then he tried to pull my underpants down, so I pushed his hand away. What's so weird about that? Well, he tried again a couple of minutes later and I did the same thing. So then he takes my hand and he puts it on his shorts. Did you pull it away? No, I just left it there for a while. So then he takes my hand and puts it into his shorts, you know, like... down there. Well, then did you pull it away? No. I was kind of curious just to see what it felt like. What did it feel like? It was big and hard, kind of like a huge carrot. [GIGGLES] Did you just take that blanket off this horse? It was right here. And then he started getting all mad. About what? He called me a tease. He said I was acting like this little girl who just wanted to lead him on all night. I don't see why, if you kiss a guy, you have to go to bed with him. Well, how mad did he get? Well, I've had guys get mad at me before, but never like this. I mean, I was afraid he was gonna hit me or something. He was overreacting. Well, how'd it end? He seemed pissed, but he said it was okay, we would kiss and go to sleep. So that's what we did. But he was pretty scary. Well, he definitely overreacted when we asked him to leave. He wanted to wait until dark. He did? Yeah. He said it was really important. [♪♪♪] I think someone's looking for him. He slept where you're sitting the night we came. Before that he must have been staying in the house. You think we should call the police? We could, but what if we're wrong? Well, we can't just go up to him and say, "Hey, who is it you're hiding from?" No. But we can test him. We could scare the piss out of him. Come on. I'm gonna call Michael. [CHUCKLES] So you wanna stir things up? M-80s? Is that what you meant? What'd you expect? I don't know, something. Well, let's light some off. No! They're too loud. I blew my eardrums with 'em once. Well, we'll light them off underwater. They've got underwater fuses. Kill some fish. You can't kill fish with M-80s. Oh, yeah? Watch me. [FUSE SIZZLING] See, I told you. No dead fish. Shh, just wait. Ha! You learn this in private school? Shut up! You do go one, don't you? Like it's my choice. My parents make me go because it's all girls. Oh, do they want you to grow up and be a fucking dyke? No, they just wanna feel like they bought everything they could for me so I'll be happy. School costs them 20 grand a year. Oh, what a fucking waste. They don't mind. [FUSE SIZZLING] It impresses their friends. Bye-bye, fishies. You know what your problem is, Sam? You really want to be bad, but you don't have the slightest idea how to do it. I can be pretty bad. Yeah? What's the worst thing you've ever done, shoplifting? No.What? Never mind. What have you done? I've done some things. [♪♪♪] I've done some things I couldn't fuckin' turn back from. Things that change your life. Those are the only bad things, if you think about it. Like, if you went into the ranch house and pulled a gun off the wall and blew the shit out of Claire and Jennifer, everything would be different. You'd be a killer! Even if you didn't get caught, you'd still be a killer. There'd be no turning back. You ever done anything like that? Then you've never been bad. Check you out. What'd you do? Nothing, really. It... It wasn't that bad. What are you looking for? Um... Claire. You know, she might try and spy on us. So let her spy. I'd rather be spied on than spying. What's Claire's story, anyway? Whenever she looks at me, I feel like she wants to haul me to her basement and cut my head open. I'm sure she does. She's weird. Jennifer's weird too. They didn't used to be like that. I mean, Claire's okay weird, but Jennifer's just a bitch. I guess the older you get, the more twisted you get. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [CAR ENGINE SHUTS OFF] Who's that? That's just Michael. He's Claire's bother. He's probably just checking up on us to see if we're being good little girls. You see them? Yeah. You were right. He definitely does not want to be seen. Well, he knows we're not supposed to have him here. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Come on. You said all the fuses were blown. I figured out how to fix them. Is everything else okay? You're sure? [♪♪♪] Sam and Jennifer are just fighting. And that's all? [SIGHS] Where is Sam, anyway? She's outside someplace, sulking. She'll be fine. Michael, we can handle this. We just haven't been around each other for a long time. Oh, I see. You're just getting to know each other again, huh? Right. You can go now. Okay. [DOOR CLOSES] They didn't tell Michael I was around, did they? It doesn't look like they did. Michael would've stayed. [CAR DRIVES AWAY] We better get back inside. HOST [ON TV]: There go the categories. [HOST CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Hey, Claire, what did Michael want? He just dropped by to tell us that the police are searching all the ranches in the area. They're about three miles up the road. They'll be here soon. So? He wanted to warn us. HOST: --there's also a candy bar named after it. Can you tell us? WOMAN: The Milky Way. HOST: That's right! [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [♪♪♪] What are you doing? Getting out of here. They must be looking for him. Why are you staring at me like that? What did you do? Shoplifted. Not that I give a damn what you think, but here. My Army dog tags. I'm a deserter. You ran away from the Army? I didn't run away, I left! You can bet your ass I wouldn't have if there was a war. You were stupid to sign up. Yeah, well, I was drunk and I didn't much else to do. Some people weren't born with your options, Miss Brentwood. You can stay. Let's see you get dragged back to camp by your throat. You won't. I swear. What's going on here, Claire? The police aren't coming. We made the whole thing up. Youmade it up. You wanted to test him. Why? You wanted to see how a criminal behaves? Is that it? Like in one of your experiments? Want me to show you how a criminal behaves? All you had to do was ask. [♪♪♪] They act angry. They act desperate. And they act mean. That's a nice sweater. Cut it out. No, no, it's really nice. Cut it out. No, really, it's really nice. Cut it out! It's really nice. Just showing you how mean a criminal can be. Mean and violent. SAM: Manny. Manny, stop! I was just beginning to like it here too. Are you all right? What do you want? I wanna help you get a ride. People will suspect you less with me. What, you're helping me? [SCOFFS] Don't make me laugh. You've had it in for me from the beginning, Claire. No, I didn't. I just knew you weren't telling the truth. Yeah. [♪♪♪] Where you heading? I don't know. Canada, I guess. I don't know. That's where deserters are supposed to go. I can get you a ride fast. I always get rides in a second. And then what, not get in the car? [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Go and hide. You wanna come? You could always come back in a couple stops if you want. Claire! Jesus! JENNIFER: What is she doing? Oh, my God! What are we gonna do? Sam, come on! We have to do something! Let's call Michael. I think I can fix the phone. How old are you, honey? Almost 18. Where you heading? Just into town. Hell, there ain't a town on this road for over 50 miles. Well, then just take us as far as you're going. You ain't from around here, huh? Just passing through. Traveling light? Yep. Where you headed eventually? North. Hell, this road is going east. Well, you-- You said eventually. [DISPATCHER CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY OVER POLICE RADIO] That's Manny. Who is he, some kind of deserter from the base? Some kind of? This guy's a murderer. He beat his drill sergeant to death with some martial-arts weapon. You couple that with kidnapping, I'd say this guy is in deep trouble. Why did he do it? I don't know the details. Maybe he didn't like the man. I gotta call Mom and Dad right now. Call them, but don't get them panicked. They're gonna stick out around here. We'll find 'em. I'll call you as soon as we know anything at all. This is as far as I go. That's my house there. Thanks. What are you gonna do now? We'll get another ride. Not many cars this time of day. We'll be fine. You don't talk much. Do your parents know you're on the road? Sure. I don't trust that guy. Come on. Operator. Give me the police. What are we gonna do? We gotta stay off the road. Maybe some of these places are summer houses. We could find one that's empty and hide. [BIRD CAWING] [RINGS] Yeah? Where? Westlake Canyon, right. Thank you. That was the police. They've been spotted. Whatever you do, don't turn on any lights. What if people come? We'll run our asses off. The refrigerator's empty. No one's been here for weeks. Okay, we'll sleep here tonight, wake up at dawn and start hitching. That way we can see cops. Sound okay? Let's check this place out. [STATIC ON RADIO] [TUNING] [WINDOW CREAKS] Let's get some sleep. Got a big day tomorrow. What's wrong? Nothing. Just thought we were heading to Canada, not to the nearest bed. How old are you, really? Sixteen. Jesus Christ. Another little tease. I am not. What the fuck am I supposed to do with another little tease? Maybe if I did this, the cops won't recognize me. What are you gonna do when you get to Canada? I haven't thought about it. Sit and stare at the clouds, I guess. Can you ever come back? Nope. But so fuckin' what? Nothing's so great about the U.S.A. But what if you wanna come back sometime? You might wanna see your parents-- I ain't going to jail for nobody! You're only a deserter. You wanna leave already, is that it? No. I can never come back. [♪♪♪] I'm not just a deserter. I beat the shit out of my drill sergeant, probably killed him. I don't know. I didn't mean to, but it makes no difference to them. See, I can't come back. What happened? He had a big fucking mouth, and I closed it. See, the Army gives you all this shit, all these promises. "Be all you can be!" "Get an edge on life, rah-rah-rah!" Then once you get there, they just pummel you. That bastard singled me out from day one because he knew he couldn't break me, that I wasn't a sheep like all the rest of them. You don't know what it feels like... to be treated like some freak outcast from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed. Yes, I do. Yeah, you do, don't you? You sure you still wanna stay here with me? Yeah. [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS ON RECORD] Hey, it works. You wanna dance? I don't know how. Well, neither do I. You dance just fine. My God, you're skinny. I guess I don't eat that much, that's why. My mom tries to force this high-carbohydrate diet on me, but I hate it, heh. It's nice the way you're skinny. [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO] [VEHICLE APPROACHING AND DOG BARKING] [MUSIC STOPS] Let's get out of here. [♪♪♪] Claire! Like you said, you always get rides in seconds. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Get out of here! Go! [TIRES SCREECH] MANNY: Oh, shit! OFFICER [OVER SPEAKER]: You are under arrest! Do not resist, do not run! Let him get to the woods, we'll never find him. Release the dogs! [DOGS BARKING] [MANNY GROANING] [SCREAMS] [OFFICER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [DOGS WHINE, BARK] Hey, walk! Bring him with me. SHERIFF: Did, uh, he inflict any harm on you? No. SHERIFF: Let's go. [♪♪♪] Claire, we called Michael because we had to. I know. I probably would have done the same thing. I would have never started with him if I knew all this could possibly happen. It wasn't your fault. Look. You keep them. [♪♪♪] SAM: Anybody want a drink? JENNIFER:I do. No, thanks. No secrets. No secrets. No secrets. Okay, we all ready to go? [RINGING] [SIGHS] Hello? Really? Thank you. They found your cat. [CHUCKLES] Come on.
