(dramatic music) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (explosion echoing) (suspenseful music) (explosion echoing) (suspenseful music) - You know, the service ain't what it used to be. My grandpa was killed in the First World War, and my Dad fought in the Second. And, everybody was drafted, so you all felt fucked by fate and united in the trenches. We weren't really killing people, as much as saving America. Being a war hero was the only thing you could do to make your front page news, assuming you couldn't join the Yankees like, like you thought you would in high school. My turn came in Vietnam. Well, you've seen the movies, and they are definitely better than the book on that one. - [Doctor] You fought in the Gulf too, didn't you? - Fought? We sat on our sweaty ass for months, and then we drove in and saw a bunch of dead people rotting in the sun. Jesus, we were janitors. All the horror, none of the fun of real battle. Where was I? - Vietnam. - Oh, yeah. See, I felt like we just became killers there. You had to be, because there wasn't any plan of attack. Hah, just a bunch of helicopters and screaming civilians. And you knew you'd done things down in the mud, so you just started hating everything that didn't have to play by the same lousy rules. It was cool to get high and let your hair grow. Kill some lousy bastards in the meantime. (watch ticking) Hmph, I got blasted on sake and cocaine one night. A buddy told me that Charlie could hear your watch ticking at night and find your position. I believed him. I threw my watch away, ha ha. Never wore one since. The tan line never went away. Does that mean anything? - [Doctor] Just look at it as your scar from Vietnam. - Yeah, I know I was lucky. Didn't need a watch there, anyway. The only time I cared about was time to get the hell out of Vietnam. Turned out nobody here ever cared about winning. Then, finally they decided they just wanted us home. Well, that was sure as shit okay by me, but it wasn't exactly like riding into Paris and having flowers throw at your feet. - [Doctor] Tilt your head forward. (electronic squelching) - Ah, so, I think happy thoughts? - [Doctor] It won't affect the test. - You see, that's just it, doesn't even matter. It used to. Army, the Corps, the Service, it's all a guy like me has got. I don't hardly know it any more. (beeps) It's all changed, and all for the worst. - [Doctor] Almost done, except for the drop your pants and cough part. - Did I say everything was worse? Ugh ... (coughs) I can do it again if you like. - And you could, but one of us might consider it sexual harassment. - Harassment? We used to call it flirting. - There's nothing funny about sexual harassment, Commander. - That's what I was saying, Doctor. Or should I say, uh, Captain? - Come on, we're late. (ominous music) - Well, then, come on, did he check out? - He seems kinda depressed. I don't know, I'm no psychologist. - I don't care about that. - Well, then, absolutely. I'm fine, too, by the way. - I already knew that. Come on, then, she's waiting for us. (suspenseful music) ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ - You perform maneuvers through a roving drone target. Let the tank do the work, so nobody gets hurt. - Nobody gets hurt? If they didn't want anybody to get hurt, we wouldn't be sitting in here. - You know what I mean. Better than you do, Dr. Jekyll. (squelching) Ugh, do we really need two people for this test? Can I be the only guinea pig? - Dr. Albright is capable of everything required. - If she's so capable and you're so confident about her, why don't you let her speak for herself? - Colonel Nelson could be right, doctor. - I'm sure you're both witty and wise. All I need is your professionalism. This system is my life's work. So, you'll excuse me if I take it seriously. - If we were any more serious, we'd speak Latin. Okay, so we do everything by the book, huh? (beeping) Full auto test ready. Hello? Hello, anybody getting this? - Yes. We're ready here. - Didn't seem like it. Going with outboard cameras, fore and aft. Engaging drive. - Wait, we haven't opened the doors. - Then you'd better. (treads chattering) Engaging pilot and target interface. Ugh! (beeping) - Colonel, are you experiencing some discomfort? (beeping) - Ah, no discomfort, but fucking head feels like it's gonna come off. - Language, please. - Sorry, Doc, I shouldn't have said head. especially in the company of a lady. - Albright, what's going on? Disconnect. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Not so fast. It's uh, it's clearing now. (beeping) Uh, no pain, just a slight buzz. Okay, okay now I can take it. I'm uh, I'm turning in each direction now. Shouldn't the drone be making an appearance here? Hey, Albright, what's the runtime? Are we there yet? - They're asking for it. Should I send in the drone? - No, release the decoy. Let's see if the inhibitor works. - That's not what they're expecting. - That's just the point. (engine roaring) - Got it. Firing, firing. Ah, shit, it's a friendly. Very funny, Doc. - Let's see, how would you put this? There's nothing funny about friendly fire, killing your own. My system prevents this. As a Gulf War veteran, I thought you'd be especially grateful. - Yeah, I don't know how they run the wars without you, Doc. - Hey, careful, you can't-- - What? Oh, oh yeah. Sort of itches like jock itch. Sunburn, I meant to say. - Any other symptoms? - Ah, no. Oh, maybe a slight ticking. (soft ticking) Maybe it's just my watch. - What was that? (engine roaring) (bomb exploding) (dramatic music) - Damn, this power surge. Shouldn't be happening. - Yeah, war is hell. Target identified as enemy drone, firing. (engine roaring) (cannons firing) (drone exploding) Ah, man, this thing is cooking me. (squelching) Ah. Where were you when the lights went out, Albright? - [Albright] In the fucking dark. Base, do you copy? - Yes, we're working on it. What a mess. - Mess, just a glitch. Did you see the response time on killing the drone, even after being distracted by the phony only seconds before? - Thunder, do you read me? I show a failure in the test link software. - Okay, I'll disconnect. We'll call you back after I've rebooted. - What's the problem? (squelching) I can't take this any more. Oh. Oh, uh. - Colonel Nelson? - Ugh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, mother, I'm right here. - How many fingers am I holding up? - 30, what's wrong with our super tank? - Nothing, it's a special transmitter for the test data. Drone must've hit it. I just gotta get out and reboot it. - Well, let's go. Look at 'em, will ya. Feel like the only person left in the world, doesn't it? - Man, this thing is toasted. Five dollar cable for a $50 million prototype. - What time ya got Albright? I got 3:30 a.m. - 3:30 a.m? I guess that's right, I don't know, I don't have a watch. - Dawn will be coming in a couple of hours. Seems like we've been out here for days. - What'd you say? - We gotta be moving by dawn. Come on and fix that thing. - I'll disconnect it, the tank doesn't need it. Then we can head back. - Head back, what the hell are you talking about? - Yeah, we'll head back. They can put in a new unit, and we can monitor the rest of the test. - We can't go back, there is no back. What was that? We've been made, come on. (suspenseful music) - Ah, what are you-- - Shut up. We have to get outta here. We're going to stealth mode. (beeping) - Where'd it go? - They're going full stealth, no infrared reflection. No electronic image capture system can see her now. - No shit, but they're not supposed to do that now. - Language, please. Albright, Nelson, great work. There's no trace of you at all. Great going. - Who's that? They're not supposed to be able to find us. - Look, Colonel, I think you're having hallucinations brought on by the system, I'm gonna disconnect you. - No, can't operate this tank without the interface. What's the matter with you? We'll be dead behind enemy lines. - It's just not combat, everything's okay. Just let me do what has to be done. - I'll beat you down, I'm the ranking officer, Captain Albright, if that is your name. (gun cocking) - Ugh! (groaning) (squelching) (beeping) - There she is. - Doctor, they're heading into the minefield. (tank rumbling) (mine exploding) (suspenseful music) (mine exploding) - Ugh! Ugh! - Does that sound like a test to you, soldier? - We're into the mine perimeter, that's all. - That's all? Christ, look at them. I'll just have to dance my way through. (alarm blaring) (tank rumbling) - Listen, Colonel, let me apologize for losing my head back there. The stress just got to me. I feel much better now. - Yeah, well, if you say so. Try that again, and I'll have to take you. I'll have to do whatever it takes to fulfill our mission. (beeping) Shit, I'm gonna drive right into one. (mine exploding) (tank rumbling) Baby can sure take the abuse. - What exactly is our mission, Colonel, as you see it? - Our mission is as simple as it is unpleasant. We've been left behind enemy lines to search out and destroy all resistance and communications. - And, how long have we been on this mission? - I've always been on this mission. Vietnam, Panama, the Gulf, and now this, whatever this is. That's what they pay me for. I'm a killer, and I kill. (suspenseful music) - I don't know how to tell you this, Colonel-- - Look, don't waste my time by being polite, okay? We're fighting for our lives here. - Well that's just it, we're not! We're on an experimental mission about an hour out of L.A. You've gotta believe me! - I've seen this before, Albright. No offense, but you've cracked under fire, and I'm gonna have to restrain you, so that you don't get us killed. (groaning) (suspenseful music) This machine can't think. Can't know if she's not a friendly anymore. Mmm. That's better. (beeping) So easy. So easy. (mine exploding) (beeping) (tank rumbling) (suspenseful music) (static buzzing) (squelching) (sighing) (tank rumbling) (suspenseful music) - There's only one man that can get us out of this. (waves splashing) (clearing throat) There he is. (coughing) - You all right, Cap? - I'll be fine. - You want a smoke? - She's coughing already, dipshit. - But she's coughing because she hasn't had a smoke. - Cut it out, you guys. - What is he doing? - He's taking a swim, what do you think? - No, he's just standing there. Look. - He's terrified of the water. - Ah, so, why is he in it? - He's trying to beat his fear. That's why I knew he'd be here. Look, you guys stay here, I'll go get him. - The guy survived two wars, afraid of the surf at Venice? Does that make any sense to you? - Of course it does. - Sure, since you think that inhaling hot toxic gas from a cigarette will stop you from coughing. - Don't listen to me. - I don't plan to. - Let me finish. It's dry, and windy, and it's early. Your own throat is probably dry and scratchy right now. Am I right? - Yeah, I suppose it is. - Well, have a cigarette, and see how it feels. (coughing) - Hey you! Mark Spitz! - Hey, beautiful. Where's Dr. Frankenstein? - I left him back at the lab. Brought Igor and dark Theroux instead. - What's up? - It's not good. - Be right there. (waves splashing) (suspenseful music) I'm fine, let go. - What the hell was that? - Yeah, I mean, if he can't swim, why'd he go in the water? - He can swim. - So, he's just a pussy. - Robinson was the first implant subject. The implant triggered a deep psychosis of water. He's trying to beat it so he can reenlist. The Army's all he had, and look what it did to him. - Oh, she left a mark. What, you've never been slapped before? Hey, look, some people actually heighten their sexual enjoyment with a little physical contact. (low beeps) - I'm not gonna lie to these men. - Yes you are because it's the only way to get this done. - They're about to risk their lives. They deserve to know the whole story. - Everyone is a volunteer in the program. After they made that choice, the rest of their duty is to follow orders, my orders. If we tell them they're going out to kill a fellow soldier, that'll prevent, or at the very least hamper, their ability to do just that. - Kill? You said we were supposed to stop Nelson! - We will. Be careful, they'll hear us. Now look, stop may mean kill. I don't want another San Diego incident here. Iron Thunder is the only irreplaceable element. - Hey, Major Robinson, who's our silent partner? - Never seen him before. - We'd better get acquainted. Hey (whistles) you, you want a smoke? Would you have a light, then? - If he doesn't smoke, why would he have a light? - Who says he doesn't smoke? - He didn't say anything. You just assume he wants to die young, like you. Let me handle this. Hey, buddy, excuse my ignorant friend here, he's just trying to say hello. I'm Theroux, this is Ashton. You gonna tell us your name? - Hey, look pal, we have to work together. We just thought it'd be nice to be friendly, but we don't have to be. You know what? Sorry, Major. I just get edgy when I don't smoke. - You're not supposed to smoke in here, anyway. - I'm supposed to be home in bed, so the least they could do is let me smoke. - Yeah, at the risk of agreeing with him, I gotta ask you, what's up Major? - I don't know. But it's not good, that much I know for sure. (approaching footsteps) - Sorry to keep you waiting. As you're about to learn, we don't have much time. Death Valley. You've all been involved in this project. Two of you have been drivers. After severe and regrettable problems adapting human soldiers for my tank-- (ominous music) (bubbling drowns out speaker) (bubbling) (waves crashing) Well, not perfected, we ran a test and, well, the tank is running wild through Death Valley. Your mission is to stop it before it reaches Barstow or Las Vegas. - At a top speed of nearly 70 miles an hour, it'll reach Barstow before we have any hope of catching it. - You're right, except he's on a search and destroy pattern. - He? - It. It's roving back and forth to sweep the area. Luckily, there's very little to destroy, but the pattern will give us time. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes, go ahead. - Destroy? You mean that this runaway is fully armed? - The test was for full combat, yes. - I'm new around here, but if I understand correctly, this fully armed, unmanned tank is completely invisible, and it jams any form of electronic surveillance, satellite photos, video. - Absolutely invisible, except to the naked eye and to magnified optics like binoculars. - Which also means that computer-based targeting systems can't lock in on it as a target. - Naturally. - And it's heading into Las Vegas, programmed to kill everything in its path. - Yes. - And this is a bad thing? I lost my whole fucking Christmas savings there once. - Something funny about this, soldier? - Nothing. I'm just trying to get a few laughs in up front before we all go out there and get killed. - You know, he may actually be right. The beta prototype that we'll be driving is not target-invisible, is it? - Age before beauty. - You're both outta line. Have a seat. (ominous music) That's an order. I'm the ranking officer here, this is my decision. We volunteered for this up front. Can't just quit now. Lives of innocent people are at stake. Since it's Vegas, they aren't innocent, but this is our mess, and you both obviously know enough that the only way to stop this tank is with the only one like it. But stop it how? - The tank you'll take will be equally matched armor-wise. You'll be able to withstand her firepower, and get in close enough for a remote control device to function. That's why Hess is here. It will override Thunder's onboard controls. Then you just get out and shut the rest down manually. - [Robinson] What's the range on that thing? - Sufficient. - 100 feet. Iron Thunder has its electronic jamming gear on. We can't expect the remote to work any further than that. - 100 feet? We might as well get out and spit on it and short out the electronics. - If that would work, I'd do it myself. - Really? Step outside gentlemen, I'll be right with you. - Hey, I've been reading up on the specs on those two tanks. This might not be so bad. Go out in the desert, blow the shit outta something, think of the bonus pay we'll get. - Yeah, and my dad can buy a new car with my life insurance policy. What about you, Hess? Think we'll make it? I thought that's what you'd say. Not up to us, anyhow. We just do what they say. - Well, yeah, so, we might as well like it. Right, Hess? - We have a helicopter at our command, but we can't risk using it. By the time it spotted Iron Thunder, it'd be shot down. - Iron Thunder's last known position, three hours ago. We just start looking. - Permission to speak freely, Doctor. Look, this is a total black bag project. I know the life you're most interested in saving here is your own. - I won't insult your intelligence by denying that. But, this is a chance for you, as well. - Well, sure, I know. You had me booted from your program after your surgery screwed me up, like it did Hess. - How would you know about that? - Just a guess, he doesn't speak, my guess is he can't. Not anymore. - The surgery and resulting blood clotting led to his stroke. He's aphasic. - So, now you need us poor, screwed up bastards to stop your solution, which is this robot runaway. - I had to go with a pilotless tank rather than risk more surgery, and more tragedies like yours and-- - Save it! I am not a tragedy. I do this for you, I want my record cleared and reinstated. I have nothing outside the Army, and I want back in. You also promise me there'll be no more surgeries, or I go public with this whole thing. You understand? - I agree to your terms. - Of course you do. So let's get it done. (ominous music) Don't worry. What am I gonna be afraid of, drowning in the desert? (beeping) (groaning) (beeping) It's these helmets I really hate. Why do they have to be airtight? - It's the fiber optics, they're sensitive to dust. We changed all that on Iron Thunder. It's more like a visor. - Changed all that then went full automatic without pilots? - Yeah, yeah that's right. - Sounds like typical government spending. You know, they could spend a little more on the padding on these seats. It's like sitting on a rock. Ow! And the headroom in here is like my girlfriend's Subaru in high school. - You had a girlfriend in high school? - Yeah. - Yeah, typical government BS. (tank rumbling) - Any request on air conditioning? - [Robinson] Yeah, crank it all the way up. - By all means, make yourselves comfortable. - [Robinson] Then how about we all go home and go to bed? - I'll laugh and laugh at that one once this is all over. Now remember, radio silence. Thunder will pick up your signal and target you if you talk. Absolute silence until you locate and engage Thunder. - [Robinson] That means you won't be telling us what to do. You know, I could really get used to that. That would be really God damn fucking cool. - Language. - Guess that's one cost you saved on Iron Thunder. - What's that? - Don't need air conditioning if you don't need crew. - Oh, yeah. - Actually, their computer gear is far more sensitive than people. - Give it a rest, Dr. Spock. (tank rumbling) - I haven't seen any signs of life, but I've had plenty of time to think, and I think I must be one of the last ones left. Seems like I've been out here alone forever, but, my watch ... My watch says it isn't even 10 hundred yet, but what day? Don't dare use the radio or I'll be spotted, but I've got to talk to somebody or I'll go crazy. So, I talk to myself. Oh, this is the worse fucking part for me, hmph. Seems like they don't even need me. I'm the weak link. Ah, not again. (tank rumbling) I gotta walk this off. (suspenseful music) (squelching) (suspenseful music) (rifles cocking) - [Man] Hold it right there. - I'm holding. Can you tell me where I am? - You are trespassing, on the sovereign state of the Unified Armies of the South. - Never heard of that. - You're wearing the uniform of the oppressor. You come onto our land, armed, and you never heard of us. And, we're supposed to believe that? - Sorry, I'm a bit confused. I've been out here a long time. I'm kinda glad you got me. I'm tired of killing. - So, you admit that you're just an assassin. - Absolutely. - Go get the car and a video camera. This is great. We finally got a fed to admit what we've known all along. Look, you're just the kinda guy we can use. - Use? - Sure! A convert is worth a 1,000 believers. My comrade is getting a camera to record your testimonial. Ha ha. - Look, I'm surrendering to you, okay? And I expect the rights the Geneva Convention affords all POWs. (laughing) - Forget the Geneva Convention. Man, you are more hard core than most. I want you to join us, fight along with us. - I'm tired of killing. I'm surrendering to you, I'm your prisoner. (laughing) - Don't be silly, we don't take prisoners! - You don't take prisoners? - No! - Then you leave me no choice. (neck snaps) - Ugh! - [Nelson] Drop it! (silenced gun firing) (dramatic music) - Come on, he's getting away. Come on, he's getting away. - No, you don't. First we pray for the fallen. Lord, accept our fallen brethren into your bountiful table of love. Let their blood rain on the parade of terror, that will crush us into human pulp. - I don't take prisoners, either. (suspenseful music) - Hey! I told you so. - Sure did. - You guys blaspheming again? - No, ma'am. - There he is! (guns firing) (dramatic music) Get on the horn and warn 'em. - Hey, we got another Waco. They killed Matthew and Luke, and that tank's heading right for you with death ring hot and heavy. - Waco, good God. - I'm gonna find the nest. - [Radio] What the heck are you talking about now? I'll bet not a week, not a day goes by, not a minute goes by, and you're gonna start talking about Waco. - Tried to surrender, and now God help you. (cannon firing) (loud explosion) (beeping) (laughs) (tank rumbling) - Buy you a beer? - Okay. - If you weren't dogs, I'd whip you silly. (tank rumbling) - Well, that's the road. Let's see where it leads. (tank rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Where are we going? - Lonespear, population 75. - That's nowhere near Iron Thunder's last position. - Doesn't matter where it's been. The trick is to find where it's going. On a search and destroy path, that's the first thing it'll find. - Clever. - We just have to hope we get there first. (loud explosion) - Only eight minutes. I'll be miles from here before they come to count the bodies. (alarm blaring) Oh, bonus, an actual tactical target, or the closest thing this place has to offer. (shell exploding) So easy, ha ha ha. They make it so easy to kill, you almost don't notice. (beeping) I wonder how much harder they make it to die. (suspenseful music) How much could it take? How much can I take? (tank rumbling) - Lonespear, population zero. - Perhaps you'd like the binoculars, so you can count the dead bodies? Be a little funnier. (fire crackling) - I grew up in a place with a population of about 100. - No sign, should I call this in? - We can't. Thunder's monitoring our channels and will know we're coming. - What is it? - Like you expect him to answer. - Hey, I'm used to people that talk too much, like you. (tank rumbling) (suspenseful music) - I see it! There he goes, a cold object moving in a hot fire. Ashton! - Yes, sir? - Get up topside. If Thunder moves out of the fire, she'll be invisible to us down here. The best eyes for this will be up top. - Hey, don't forget your helmet. You'll need protection up there. (dramatic music) (beeping) There's no motion now. Maybe the shadow on the fire was some other object. Ashton, anything? - No sign. (gun firing) What are you doing? We can't see the target, you're our eyes! - I beg your pardon, sir, but I can't see if I'm dead up there. Her guns are pelting us. (cannon firing and shells exploding) - Hess, get the remote on, she's plenty close. (tanks rumbling) Hold on! (cannon firing) - Oh. - Theroux, we gotta do this by hand, fire! - Where? - Right in front of us. (cannon firing and shells exploding) Hess, what's going on with the remote? Can you fix it? Do it, and fast! (cannon firing and shells exploding) - You can't even scratch it. - If you hit somebody and they don't go down, you hit 'em again. Fire again, down five degrees. (cannon firing and shell exploding) - Finally, some resistance. Tough bastards, too. I'll just have to knock their feet out. (cannon firing and shell exploding) - I think someone's throwing rocks at us. - It's going for our treads. It knows it can't penetrate our armor. Pretty smart machine Doc Walker has against us. Right, Dr. Albright? Little too smart, maybe? (shell exploding) - You saying we've had it? - I never say that. (suspenseful music) (shell exploding) - I can't see through all this smoke. (beeping) - It's not as bad as it seems, it's worse. How you coming with that, Hess? (shell exploding) That better mean two seconds, or it'd be just too bad for us. - [Theroux] Still can't see anything. (shell exploding) - Try to outrun her, maybe she's slower than us. - Don't you dare run from me. (tank rumbling) - Oh, man, I think I'm gonna puke. I can't ride backwards like this. - We have to keep the front facing the enemy. That's the thickest armor. - Exactly, Theroux. Keep firing whenever you get a chance. (cannon firing and shell exploding) It can outrun running Thunder. - Oh, that felt great! Oh yeah, much farther away than before. Yeah, we're as good as home. (tank rumbling) - I think I'll knock and see if anybody's home. (tanks banging) - Can't get a clear shot. He'll finish us off at will. - Well then, why doesn't he? - He will, when he's sure we're all good and terrified. - Enough fun. (beeping) God damn machine! (alarm blaring) What the? - Nice job. What else can you do with that thing? (tanks rumbling) - Okay, I'll just go manual. (beeping) God damn it! Oh, Jesus. God damn me! Ugh! Ugh, but not yet. Ah. (tank rumbling) - Ready to fire on command. - So, finish them off. - Hey, that's not our mission. - That fucking thing tried to kill us. - Excellent battle assessment, soldier. We pulled its teeth, and we put on a leash. That's your job, Albright. - What? - What's the problem? The machine is shut down. Now, go over there and get in. Let's get back to Dr. Frankenstein in time for dinner. - Yeah, right, sorry. - What's wrong? Thunder is harmless now, isn't it? - Yeah, Hess, you and I'll go. - Sir, I'd like to grab a quick smoke, if that's okay. - No, too dangerous. - But I thought that-- - Call the base, report what has happened. We'll just sit here and watch. I don't think we've been given the whole story on our unmanned rogue tank. (suspenseful music) - Look, I'm supposed to do this, but I'm not a good enough shot. Alright, I'm a perfectly good shot, but I can't look Nelson in the face and shoot him. I'll hesitate, and he'll have enough time to kill the both of us. - Theroux, watch sharp. Keep your finger on the trigger. - What am I watching for? (dramatic music) (gun firing) - There he is! - No, he's hiding behind the tank. - I'll take us around. (tank rumbling) - I've got him, firing. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) That's it, gentlemen, it's toe-to-toe time. Grab your guns, and go after him. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. (gun firing) - What are you shooting at? - Anything that can shoot back. (gun firing) - Why did you block our fire? We had Nelson in our sights. - I didn't do it on purpose. - Save it. - Hey, I didn't think anybody else had to die. - Nelson wiped out a whole town! It's too late to think about saving lives! (guns firing) All right. Let's get inside and get this monster outta here. (guns firing) Clear! Must've had a spare airtight helmet like mine on when he ran. - Yeah. (coughing) - Figures! Take the carburetor and this thing is just a boat anchor. (engine grinding to a stop) (beeping) - There you are, where have you been? - Just let him rant for a few moments out of politeness. Yes, base, we're calling from Iron Thunder, it is in our control. - I see you. You have to get to cover. That town that was destroyed is drawing a lot of unwanted media attention. - Yes, when towns are destroyed, the media usually follows. - You have to take cover, let the helicopters clear. - Aren't you even gonna ask about Nelson? - Um ... - Uh-huh, you sent us out here to murder a man, and didn't even let us know. Well, we almost lost your charming assistant, Albright, and your previous casualty, Hess. Would you have gone out there knowing you might have to kill Nelson? - Ha, fuck no, I like Nelson. Thought he was old and smart enough not to let you touch him with your electrodes and scalpels. - Language, please. Now, I'm sorry that Nelson is dead, but if-- - Dead, who said he's dead? (gun firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Okay, he's hiding behind the last house. I'll go left, you go right. - No, no, we shouldn't, it's a bad idea. - How's this for an idea? How about I capture Nelson and we go the media and expose you and this whole vivisection program? - Do you think I like using people in this program? Especially ingrates like yourself? The weakness in my work is that it must still use people. They are the weak link. If I could copy the human machine, ape the human brain in microchip form, so that I'd never have to rely on the likes of you again, I'd be satisfied. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) I have feelings, too. I'm trying to remove people from the dangers of war. - Remove people from war? You think the machines are only gonna kill each other? Hey, look, we have a deal, you and I, and I already know that you lied to get me out here, so why should I stick to my half of the bargain? - If you expose this program, you'll never get reinstated. You'll just go off and ... - Come on, we got a tank to hide. - See anything? - You got a smoke? (heavy breathing) - Jesus, man, you look like you just got laid. - I got to admit, this is a rush. - Getting killed is a rush? You didn't even want to come out here. - We're not killed. And, yeah, it's just like playing army as a kid, only-- - Only, only after you die out here, you don't get to home and get cookies from mom before you go to bed. Come on, let's get that bastard, and get the fuck outta here - Hess, wait, wait a minute! Damn thing's stuck in drive. There, go again. (tank rumbling) Guess I should check with Frick and Frack. Theroux, Ashton, you there? - Yeah, we're here. You fucking gave our position away. - Do you have him yet? - No, but he's close. There's a whole fricking maze of old junk out here. It's an old junkyard. - Junk in a junkyard. Tell me something I don't know, like when you'll have him. - I don't know, we're looking. - Get him alive, if you can. - [Ashton] That's a real nice idea, but this guy is shooting to kill. - [Theroux] Yeah, if you want him alive, you better call us back and bring in the troops. If we see him, it's him or us. - No, you stay there and get him dead or alive. We're hiding these tanks and laying low until further notice from Dr. Octopus. Check in every 15. We'll relieve you if we're here past dusk. - Where are we gonna hide? (tank rumbling) - It's off the beaten track enough, right Hess? - You know, he can't answer, why ask? - Let's see, I know he can't speak, just like I knew that we were following an unmanned tank. Just checking, you might say. (suspenseful music) Okay, town's secure. Let's get out of the heat. Sorry, Hess, somebody has stay with the tanks. - We can see the tanks just fine from here. - Sure can, but I don't trust him, or anyone right now. - Man, I need a smoke. - So, have one. - My hands shake too much. - Here. - I wanna talk to you about something. - This isn't a good time, it'll have to wait. - It's already waited too long. - So, leave it alone. - That wouldn't be fair to either of us. - Everything is fair in love and war. Cliche equals brutal reality. I'm the poster boy for it. - I know you hate Walker. - Hate is too short a word for it. - And I went along with him in not telling you about Nelson. - Oh, that I can forgive, but what I can't change is the fact that my life is over, and you held the scalpel that killed it. - We planned it together. It was a quick promotion for you, and a raise and a happily ever after for the both of us. The night before, we got drunk and you raised a toast to, what was it, a shortcut to our dreams. (laughing) - I'd forgotten that. What was that again, shortcut to our dreams? Now all I have is fear and it's only getting worse. At first I thought, well there goes my career as a lifeguard. Then I couldn't sleep when it rained. And, I found myself watching the water spiral down the drain in the shower and felt like I was falling. Doesn't make any sense, but I can't make it stop. And that's the way it is with us. I'm sorry to say, but when I look at you, I see you with that knife in your hand doing it. - I held the knife, but it was your love and faith that gave me the strength to use it. - Jesus, don't say that. - It hurts, but it's the truth. It's the only truth in this whole nightmare. You don't want back in. Let me get out. Then we can build a life together without the Army. - I could have at first, but I can't now. Walker owes it to me. I want something out of this, because everything else I wanted is gone. There's nothing left of us that I'll ever have now. - The night we got drunk, we got too drunk to fool around. - No, it's too late. - You can still have me. It's one thing, it's a place to start. - We can't, not here. - You always were the shy, shy one. - There's not enough time. - Relax, we've already got the tank. They'll get Nelson. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (romantic music) - The smell of these make you easy to find. (heavy breathing) And these vests make you harder to kill. (gun firing) (waves crashing) (gun firing) - Help! Help! (gun firing) - Ashton is hit, I'm pinned down, need help. Repeat. - Don't repeat, stay there, we're on our way. Keep firing so we can find you. (glass breaking) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) The shots are either coming from that trailer or behind that junk. - I gotta get to Ashton. - Absolutely, let's lay down cover fire. (guns firing) Hess, you check out that spot to the right. I'm going left. - We're here now. You're gonna be alright. - No, I'm not. - How do you know? You're not the doctor here. - I've been hurt in the past, pretty bad, too, a couple times, but never this bad. - Look, look, you're always wrong about everything, haven't you figured that out by now? - No, I'm the one who's right. - Don't argue with me, you're gonna make it! - Smoke. Smoke. - Yeah. - No, no, Nelson. Nelson's got one of my smokes. You could find him by the smell. - Nelson, I know you're in here. I sent the others away so we can talk. - Robinson, what the hell are you doing here? - I know you're in here, I can smell the cigarette. They say you're crazy, man, but you know you can trust me. Talk to me. - How'd you get this far behind enemy lines, Robinson? - I'm in the other tank. - The other? You mean in the enemy tank? You went over to the other side, man, I can't believe it. After everything I taught you. - No, wait, it was Dr. Walker that did this to you. And, Albright, too. - Albright, I killed her in the minefield. - Sure, sure whatever you say. Look, they'll probably be back here soon. We can make 'em both pay for what they did to us. You just have to come in with me. Just you and me. The others aren't important. Trust me, man. Neither of us has any choice. (suspenseful music) (rifle cocking) (sighs) Ah, Hess, have you seen Nelson? What the hell do you think you're doing? What did you hear, everything? Look, it was all just bull, you know, to get him to come in or come out in the open. What are you gonna do? Shoot me and explain later? My grandmother had a stroke. She couldn't speak like you, but she couldn't really write, either, just like you, I'll bet. Look, soldier, you gotta tow the line, because you don't have any choice, now get back to the tanks. That's an order. (suspenseful music) - Here he comes. - How is he? Nelson is still around here somewhere. We gotta find him. Come on, soldier. - I'm gonna finish my cigarette first. (somber music) - Wait a minute, what's that? - I don't hear anything. (tank rumbling) - Damn it, Hess! - Oh man, he's been hit pretty hard. - He's lucky to be alive. I don't have time to care right now. We gotta keep Nelson in sight. - Why didn't he kill Hess? - Maybe he thought he did. - I got away. - There's a reason for this. - Look, Theroux, I'm sorry Ashton is dead, but that's the way it is in war, even a little one. Most die, some live, there is no reason If you can't accept that, then deal with it later. You see that? (tank rumbling) No time. (dramatic music) (tank rumbling) - What is it? - Air conditioning's out. - It's tough, ain't it. (tanks rumbling) (dramatic music) She's a sitting duck, blow the treads off! - Something's wrong. - What the hell are you talking about? The bastard killed your friend. Kill him! - No, this is too easy. - I'm taking back firing control, and fire without you. - No, stop! Stop! Stop, this thing's wired to blow. (tank rumbling) - That amazing bastard. Can't penetrate our armor, except from the inside. Left you alive, Hess, so that we'd all get in the tank together, and then he'd get us all at once. (dramatic music) - You gotta stop, I can't hold this thing. Trace that wire, see where it goes. - I'm coming back there. - No, don't! The wire leads into the targeting system that you're wired into. (clanking) - Okay, let's all keep cool. Nelson didn't have more than 20 minutes to rig this thing, so it can't be incredibly complicated. - If we shut off anything, it could cut the power in the wire. - That might be all it'll take to keep it from blowing. - [Theroux] Yeah, or that could be exactly what'll blow it. - Absolutely right. - Careful, don't break the leads! (beeping) - Okay, we can't cut the wire. We gotta figure if we cut the current, it blows. The shell is the bomb, so we take it out, open it up, empty out all the explosive material, without triggering it. - It's gonna be almost impossible. If we slide the shell out and accidentally disconnect the wire, we go. - The only easy way out of this is to let it blow, and kill us all. I'd rather do a little work and try to live. - I'm ready. - No, I'm stuck in here, I'll do it. - Somebody's gotta hold the shell while it's pried open. - Absolutely, but we need space to work, and there's no sense in us all dying. Albright? - I'm not leaving. - You've got that right, sister, you're a surgeon and this is like doing brain surgery. - But, she's a woman. - I'll take that as a compliment, now go. - Has to be that way. Hess suffered a head wound and you're ... Well, let's just say you're too young to die. - Nelson's gotta be out there somewhere, waiting for the big boom before he comes back to finish us off. Yeah, you're right. We're screwed either way. - Okay, I'll hold it steady, you get the head off. We get that off, we've saved the tank. Explosives inside will turn us to jelly, but Dr. Walker's tank will make it. - Oh, great. (metal squeaking) (suspenseful music) Careful. You got it. Now, pull. Careful. - I can't see the end of the wire. - Figures. It's clear down at the blasting cap. Just start emptying the shell till we get to the bottom. - Okay, you wanna make me feel better? After I've removed this gunpowder, how dangerous is the blasting cap? - Not too bad. Enough to blow your face off. Careful, no laughing. (suspenseful music) - What is going on? - Shut up, we're busy! - Busy doing what? You've been out of contact for hours. We have your position, and you're out in the open again. What are you thinking? Talk to me. Come on, talk to me. Where is Iron Thunder? - Shut that thing, off! - Talk to me, Albright. - I can't. We'll cut the current. - Talk to me. Come on, talk to me. - Right. - Where is Iron Thunder? Talk to me, Albright, Robinson, what is going on out there? - You hold the shell. I'm gonna reach in, and you push on the outside. We've gotta unscrew the shell casing to expose the cap. - But the wire runs in-- - Through the bottom, and every twist we make is gonna pull on it. You've got to keep it from coming loose. - This is serious, Robinson. This is your life we're talking about, not just a job. And, you, too, Albright. I'll blame you for this whole program's failures. You're the one with blood on your hands. - Watch what you're doing. Don't let that fucker distract you. - I heard that. Language, please. - Shut up, you motherfucker! (bomb exploding) - What was that? - I don't know. - Are they still on the scope? - Yeah, but we lost the radio and their homing signal. (coughing) (banging) - I'm fine. (groaning) Get this off. (groaning) - It won't budge. - I can feel a pulse. - I'm all right. I'm just dizzy. It's really hot in here. Get this thing off of me. Sweating like crazy. - It looks worse than it is. Head wounds just bleed like crazy. Just gotta get this thing off. - It's jammed. - I'll do it! Ah! - [Theroux] No. - Gotta get outta here! Ah! (grunting) (water bubbling) (dramatic music) (groaning) (water bubbling) (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - Come on, Albright. - What's the use? - We're alive. Look, it's like Robinson told me when Ashton ate it. He's dead, we're alive, you can cry about it later. - No, I mean what's the use? We can't beat him, we're equally matched. - We don't have a choice, he doesn't take prisoners. Yeah, you're right, we can build one of these like Nelson did. - Yeah, but we can't sneak into his tank like we did ours. - We don't have to. Look, during World War II, the only way the Germans had to defeat the new Russian tanks was to sneak in close enough to stick a land mine under the turret's armor. - Anybody ever tell you, you read too much? - Read? I got it off the internet. (scoffs) Now, look, he'll stop to finish us off, okay. We play dead, I sneak up close enough to stick one of these under the turret. - There's no time! We can't rig it as a bomb, he'll be here in minutes. - We don't have to. I get it in there, and then I hit it with small arms fire. (tank rumbling) - Sorry, old friend. Now, where's the rest of your crew? - Let me get as close as you can't, but cover me. (tank rumbling) - Everything seems clear. But, I can't see through metal. They're probably dead, or dying inside. I just have to finish them off by hand. (guns firing) (laughing) (gun firing) Stupid courage. (bomb exploding) (beeping) (metal creaking) - Hey, we did it! - Duck! (gun firing) (squelching) - God damn thing. They'd be dead by now, if I'd just used my own eyes. Well, then, I bet she'll still follow me. (tank rumbling) That's right. Got too much blood on my hands now to let me go. Come and get me. (tank rumbling) (beeping) - They're moving again. - The fools are moving closer to Los Angeles. What are they doing? - You want me to guess? - Absolutely not. Where is Iron Thunder? - No sign of her, but if they had her, we'd see her. - I can't stand waiting any longer. Come on, we're going in. - What? - I'm taking the chopper, it's already rigged. - That bomb will vaporize everything in a 400-foot radius. It'll blow out windows in Calabasas, everyone will know. - Iron Thunder will reach the outskirts of Los Angeles in less than an hour. We have to cut our losses. - What, by killing Albright and the rest? - It's a terrible price to pay, but it's a bargain. I can explain away an explosion, and the leftover pieces aren't anything that will expose or destroy our program. It'll be a bit embarrassing, but we can go on. And, believe me, we will go on. (dramatic music) (beeping) (tank rumbling) - There's no sign of him up here. How about you? (dramatic music) (tank rumbling) Ah! There he is, on the left, left! (cannon firing) (shell exploding) (tanks rumbling) (dramatic music) - Goodbye. (dramatic music) (wind blowing) (somber music) (helicopter engine roaring) - There. There they are, sir. Or rather, there they were. - Drop it, anyway. - They're already dead, sir. - I don't care, I don't want any trace. Drop it. - Wait, wait, wait, look, right down there. - Pick her up, and we'll blast the rest. - Don't you recognize the remote control? You may want to die for the cause, I don't. - No, no, no! (gun firing) - Oh, shit! - Language. (loud explosion) - No! (helicopter crashing) (birds chirping) - They say, the lucky ones are dead at the end of the war, because they can't remember. But, lucky or not, we're the only ones left. And I noticed that you and I have something in common. I wondered what you could tell me about that, huh? I've been out here so long, my memory's just a little fuzzy. My mind's a little fuzzy too, to be honest, and I'm just more than a little lonely. So, tell me, what did they do to us? Tell me, and I'll let ya live. I shouldn't promise that. But I will, just this once. I don't make promises lightly. Tell me. - Ahh. - You had your chance. (clicking) There's a better way. Come on, you got one, too. Come on! (dramatic music) Think you're done with fighting, huh? I tried that. Didn't work for me, and there's not a prayer in hell of it working for you. Come on. Come on! (suspenseful music) (attacks pounding) Look at me, soldier. - Ugh! Ugh! - I can't help but kill, it's all I know, but, if you stop me. Ugh! If you kill me, then you're making a new man out of me. - No! (grunting) (punches striking) (suspenseful music) (birds squawking) - Come back here! (attacks pounding) (both groaning) (head crunching) (birds chirping) Can you help me, soldier? I've lost my watch. I know it seems kinda silly, but it's kind of special to me. Can you help me? (melancholy music) - Hold it right there. - Surrender or die, commie. - Hey, look, he's a real Army guy. - How do you know? - Look at his uniform, stupid. Is that your real blood? - Yeah, we heard a big bang and saw smoke. - Yeah, what happened? - I don't wanna talk about it. (serene music) (gears turning and tank rumbling) (inspirational music)
