[PETRA] Elena. I had a dream about you last night. You were soft. Walking the streets of New York in a silk blouse. I try to get close... touch you... to feel your smell. But when I look, you're on top of a wall, entangled in a mesh of electric wires. I look again and it's me who's on top of the wall. I touch the wires, trying to get a shock. And I fall off the wall from very high and die. [PETRA] Our mother always told me that I could live anywhere in the world. Except New York. That I could choose any profession except acting. On September 4th 2003, I started studying Theater at Columbia University. They wanted me to forget you, Elena. But I returned to New York, hoping to find you in the streets. I bring with me everything you left in Brazil. Your videos, pictures, diaries... letters on tape because you were always embarrassed of your handwriting and preferred recording your impressions of the days here to send us. Today I walked through the city listening to your voice and I identify so much with your words that I start losing myself in you. Dad, Olinda, Ana Petra... recording. March 4th, 1990, Hi, again, I'm in NY. It doesn't even seem I've been here over a month. I feel like an Indian coming to the city. Everything's so ahead, it takes time to get used to. It's good but takes time. Here you gotta think small, aim small, or the city swallows you up. March 20th, I started taking some divine singing classes. To sing open fascinates me, I'm even learning Italian, German, to sing better. Dancing's cool too. For once, I'm really dancing, not just modern jazz, but butch, flamenco... everything. I was a bit against acting classes, they like everything you do. Then I met this teacher, Modica, he's a real director, demanding a lot of us. He even recommended me for my first casting test! [WOMAN] How old are you? - 20. [WOMAN] 20? And how tall are you? Five nine and a half. [WOMAN] You were born in Brazil? I was born in Brazil, and I've been here almost a year and a half now. [WOMAN] What brought you to come to the United States? I was doing theatre there since I was 14 years old and then... the possibilities in Brazil are like, either you continue doing theatre which, I mean, there are very few productions, or you do soaps. I was invited to do one... I mean after a while I was in theatre, but I don't really like it. [WOMAN] You wanted to do other things? Films. And in Brazil, it's like, almost none! Especially now that the system changed there. It's like, 1 movie a year at best. [WOMAN] Do your parents get you involved in this business at all? No. My mom is a journalist and sociologist, she writes for the newspaper there and my father's a politician. He lives in Brazil as well. [PETRA] Actually, our father always said that we inherited this dream of making films from our mother. And in the middle of your videotapes, I found this film that she never showed me. It's a silent film where she plays the lead. From the time she still dreamed of being a Hollywood star and kissing Frank Sinatra. This made her feel like a woman. And helped her escape from a world where she felt out of place... misunderstood. The daughter of a traditional family from Minas Gerais, she could see no place for herself except in marriage. A society lady. One day, sitting in front of the mirror in her dresser room, she makes a drawing. The drawing of her sadness and decides she has until her 16th birthday to find meaning to her life. And she finds our father. A Brazilian who just arrived from the country she dreams of in films and songs, but who comes back from New York not as a Sinatra, but as a Che Guevara carrying in his pockets books by Marx, and the desire to start a revolution. And overnight, our mother leaves the Catholic school, sells her TV, her hair, and jumps into the street demonstrations. Together they joined the Communist Party ready to be sent off the to guerrilla warfare in Araguaia. But when the leaders see her 6-month belly, they don't let them go. Almost all the young people that go end up executed by the military. It was you in our mother's belly who saved our parents lives. And in the middle of this turmoil you were born and raised in hiding, never allowed to tell anyone where you lived. I wonder how this time stayed in your memory. In your body. The first images I find of you you just turned 13 and got this camera as a present. “Filming? “She's looking!' “...knows who's Elena, Petra..." It was when I was born, in the 80s, the time of the amnesty. Our family stopped being clandestine and seemed to enter an American commercial from the 50s. “What an actress, lots of expression...' And you start to dance. Dance... My mother said that since you were 4 you knew you wanted to be an actress. And it seems you always found a way of putting me in the picture. “Isn't there a way to film without your knowing, Elena?' Why? You want to film me... "Without you noticing.“ “Natural.” “Cause when you notice, you change.” I change? "When filming you change. When not, you're different.” How am I? “More natural.' So... Please, Pedro, bring the Dermil. "We're out of baby cream.“ Look... This beautiful girl... is my sister! [PETRA] You showed me all the Shirley Temple movies and trained me to become an actress. First, you teach me how to sing. “Move your leg a bit Olinda." Wait! “Pull the curtain.” “Sing, Petra!' “Wait, I'm taking a bath.“ “You can sing in the bath.“ I can't sing, dance and take a bath. “Yes you can!“ I'm soaping up. I can't sing! “You said you'd sing.' I won't sing. “Then I'm leaving.“ [PETRA] You spend the afternoons directing me acting, creating scenes. “Action! Clapper!' [doorbell] Who's there? “Mrs. Valquiria." [PETRA] I remember watching this scene where you killed my Nanny and I had so many nightmares of this. “I always film improvising. Do this, do that... Never know where people are going, always moving.' “Put on some music.' “I'm dancing with the moon.' [PETRA] When you turned 15 our parents separated and you stopped filming. And little by little, I feel you becoming distant. I look for you. You stopped playing theatre with me to become a real actress. And when you're 17 you join the Flying Bull Theater Group. Come back. Choose me, take me. “I thought you weren't coming, had run away with a young girl. I'm sick with love. Touch me, I tum to water.' Love was this, the bell and its song. [PETRA] The other actors tell me you practiced non-stop. Obsessively. That even when everything seemed perfect for you it was never good enough. Something was always missing. But you're not satisfied. You want more. You say you want to be a film actress. [children singing] And on my birthday you took me by the hand led me up these stairs came into this room closed the door and said: “You're going to be 7... it's the worst age. I'm going to live far away... we won't see each other for a while. But I'm giving you this shell. Whenever you miss me, put it over your ear. I'll also have a shell and this way we can talk.“ [PETRA] You put the shell over my ear and I hear the ocean. You were right. 7 was my worst age. “You look alike.“ “You really look alike!' “Very mixed, you and her... your smile, the way you pucker your mouth.' “The forehead, very alike.' “Your small hands, so delicate... She had big hands... powerful... I loved holding her hand.' “You and your sister didn't lookalike then. Later many of her traces appeared in you.' “Your eyes... are the same!' “Impressive, amazing.' “Deep set eyes of a sparrow.' “You're so very like Elena. Incredible. You've her temperament... You look like her... At times I call you Elena!” April 20th, My life's better than ever. Springs here and it seems the whole city's in heat While I don't get in a university I learn all I can in open courses. I spend the days running from class to class, but it's great. I do breathing exercises, singing and no one minds... May, Last week I met Coppola. He even invited me to see shootings of Godfather III. Who knows I might get a small part I've goosebumps thinking of it. [PETRA] You take your photos to several film companies and get to do some auditions. You leave this interview excited but the days pass and there's no news. No one calls you back. You call them many times and they tell you to wait. You can't stand this time. This waiting. June 3rd, I see myself in the train window, how much weight I gained in 3 days, what decadence... When I eat I don't feel like stopping. I want more, keep thinking what's next, but it starts to finish and I get sad. No more. But I'll eat more. I want to go to the end, even knowing there's no end. But in 4 days I'll recover, totally. In 7 days I lose 10 lbs and do great photos with Marcelo, as model and actress. There, it's easy. Now I feel fat and empty. The train takes ages, to make things worse. I'd like my Dad, Mom and sister with me now. Can my roots pierce asphalt, pipes and buildings, to survive and bear fruit? Yes, if my roots were strong, big. But I feel my seed hasn't even sprouted yet. So, probably in a city, if it sprouted, small and sickly it would grow. [PETRA] I'm still 7 and you come back thinking that here in Brazil your roots will find more space to grow. I want to be really thin. The more I say it the more I eat. [PETRA] But a letter arrives saying you were accepted to a university in New York. And our mom decides that this time we'll go the 3 of us. Together. So we won't be so alone. You get on the plane showing me how everything works how it flies. But in an instant, you start crying. It's your ears that hurt. I feel strange seeing my big sister crying. You argue with my mother, There is anger in your crying. Such deep, forceful crying. “Do you have the address... the number of the building? Are you sure it's 76th?' “I do, but it's not with me now.” “I think it's closer this way, I'm not sure.“ Want to go this way to see? I don't think it's this block, I think it's that one. “Mom...” I don't think it's this one. There was something here... some artist thing. 31. “Is if?' Must be. The owner lived there and downstairs... We rented the two above... On top were other tenants. “Want to ring the bell?” It asks to leave message and phone number. “Do you remember if it was here?“ Yes. “Sure?” Almost certainly. I thought there was a small building on the other comer. From there I'll know for sure. How beautiful this tree! Look here, from the bottom. So wonderful. [PETRA] I don't like the first months in New York. Olinda doesn't take care of me anymore and I hate it. I hate learning English. The school The teacher with her tiger skirt. And the cold. When I get home I do 2 small rituals: I scratch my wrists with a serrated knife till they're really red and I put a band-aid on my forehead. You see me, and pull me into the bathroom. Serious, you say: Petra, be a good actress. If you want to draw attention, do it right. Nobody's going to believe in this band-aid in the middle of your forehead. Hide it a bit under your bangs and it will be much more convincing. At that time I didn't believe in God or in Santa Claus. But I believed in mermaids. They seemed as possible to me as the seahorses I saw in the aquarium. You take me to watch "The Little Mermaid" in the cinema near our house and on this day, you start playing theatre with me again and we come back singing and feeling like her, underwater. Dreaming of changing skins. Then, you read me the original story where the Little Mermaid suffers to become a woman, loses her voice and dies. What do you mean, she dies? I feel betrayed. I ask to sleep with you. What's left of this memory is this dance we created together. See me? [PETRA] The Little Mermaid accepts the pain of a knife cutting into her body bleeding her body to get legs and be able to dance. September 10th, My vocal chords are hurt, always have been. It's not just ice, the cold wind, tension, anxiety, but mostly an awareness of the fear, the lack of love for myself, for my voice. Maybe I need a special therapy to de-traumatize and take this mesh out of my chest and throat, that before didn't let me breathe and now doesn't let me speak, nor sing. She told me she felt a huge emptiness here. She felt lonely, a lack of love. Felt a terrible loneliness. She stayed in one room, Petra in another. [PETRA] One afternoon I bring a friend home. My first new friend after months. I start showing her our house. The living room, the bedroom, until we come to yours. I knock on the door and come in with the girl. You're all covered up only your face is showing. Your eyes are red. Maybe you said something from your bed, I don't remember. All I remember is that when we left the room, my friend with an anxious look asked me what was wrong with you. She's like that, I answered. She's like that. I got a bit impatient and told her to make an effort, it wasn't good for you to see her so down. She got up angry and left saying she'd kill herself. I tried grabbing her, I was hall dressed. She got in the elevator... I got desperate. This body is sick. Life made it totally sick. Totally. That out of control self returned and I act as though an actress, I see all as on a film screen: "My rhythm, my breathing, the eyes becoming different. The worlds empty, deserted, it's no use waiting for anyone. You're alone, completely alone. What are you going to do? I'll degrade myself and go down... this drain. Now I'm getting in it. Good. [PETRA] Our mother spends hours looking for you in the streets, desperate. But after some time, you come back. She takes you to a psychiatrist and you start being treated with lithium. She was sitting on the bed, I sat down... She said, “Art for me is everything, without art I'd rather die. If I can't be an artist, better to die.” I said, “Elena... it's not like that. Why did you go back to theatre class? We made a deal you wouldn't. You wouldn't go...' She didn't do theatre for a month. She said, “Then nothing has any meaning for me.” I said, “We made a deal. Why go if it makes you feel so bad... Wail.“ I said, “I waited for you, I'm so tired, and have to leave early at 5.” “Will you look after Petra?" She nodded. She lay down on her bed. I said, “I'll come back early, as soon as it ends. You'll wait for me? Take care of Petra?' I went to my room and she started sobbing. I didn't go back there. She cried for about 10 minutes, then stopped. At 5 in the morning I went to her again, “Here's the alarm clock so you take Petra to school.” She nodded and went on sleeping. [PETRA] You wake me up in the morning. You're sad, I don't like it. Your sadness. I remember it's the day of show and tell and it's my turn to take something to show and tell to my class. You go to your room, you come back with a blue stuffed dog. You explain that it has special powers and that whenever I really wanted something I just had to close my eyes, make a wish, shake the little dog, and my wish will come true. When it's time for show and tell the children form a circle and my turn comes to explain what the dog's about. It shakes, and has sad eyes. And the children ask: but doesn't it play music? Doesn't it do anything else? No. It only shakes and has sad eyes. You stay home. All day long at home alone. Doing what? Talking to whom? At the end of the day, a friend calls you. You were supposed to meet. I've been imagining this person for 20 years. What did you say to him? What did he do? [MAN] This one weekend that we had planned on her coming to see the show I was doing, I called her late in the day. She didn't sound good. So I said 'Elena, I'll come and get you, we'll go out for a drink, we'll go out for a coffee or whatever it is you like to do I'll come get you.' She was hysterical over the phone. She was like 'I don't want you to see me like this' and 'I'm not doing so well' and I said 'No, Elena, it's OK it's not a problem, I'll come and get you! Please let me come and get you, I'll jump in a cab and I'll come and I'll get you!' and she said 'No no, Michael please, I don't want to see you, I feel bad, I feel terrible and I don't...' I said 'I'm coming to get you.' So I jumped in a cab with my roommate and rang the bell, rang the bell, rang the bell... She wasn't answering. And then I ran to the corner to a pay phone and I called her, and I kept calling and calling and calling her but the line was busy... I was so frustrated, so angry. I'd been out there for, like, an hour and I didn't know what to do when your mother showed up. [PETRA] You take a whole bottle of aspirin sit at a desk and write this letter. “This mystery, I feel dark, in darkness, which will never end. I don't dare wish to work in theater, cinema, dance, singing. 'Cause I lived them and moments later I no longer had their light, and didn't know what for nor why I did them, and the same sadness took over me.“ This day everyone is out, the guy rang all apartments to get someone to open to save Elena, but nobody came, no one was here. I asked them to help take her quick, they didn't want to carry her... wanted to wait for the ambulance. “Feel so sick. If only I could vomit. Not even that. I feel weak, a coward and ashamed before life and everyone. I want to die. Reason? So many it's ridiculous to mention. I give up Because my heart's so sad I feel I have the right to no longer wander with this body that occupies space and keeps on shattering what I have that's so... fragile.' There was some blood on the walls, a syringe and a knife. There was a table in the comer with a word-processor where she'd been writing. When we came in she was lying on the bed. From that side to this. In the middle of the bed, like this. I want to disappear. [PETRA whispers] This time I was not supposed to fight... I remember... I remember. They came with this interrogation, asking questions for hours... Was she drugged? I said no, they kept asking instead of attending her... They took so long. She started to cough, sat up faint in bed, coughing. It's when she vomited. I screamed and they came and took her to dean out her lungs. I'm dancing with the moon. [PETRA] When I got back home I saw my mother with such a sad, desperate look I'd never seen before. Did Elena die? I asked. And she told me it was you. I found everything so cruel. When I told you Elena died, the first thing you said was “It hurts my feelings.” You started to cry and asked for your cuddly elephant. Someone got it and you kept him on your lap like this... They got H, you kept it on your lap... [PETRA] In the days that followed my cousin told me that if I wanted I could keep on talking to you. That you'd be invisible, but you'd hear me. I do this. I talk to you. Guilt is... the head catching fire. The pain of guilt. Anguish, is here... And then... guilt... tchaa... The pain is so unbearable, the physical suffering, It seems the only way out is death. Nothingness. But how could I leave you alone? This story ran in my head: “If I'd arrived home, found Elena dead... I'd rent a car, put you and her in it, drive off a cliff and all would end.' So I understood... such stories, “Killed family and committed suicide.' But this was no solution, I couldn't do this to you, my little seven-year-old. It wasn't a way out. It was just... My despair, a torment in the head. [PETRA] After you die, our mother becomes longing. Always with a sad, distant look. I ask: 'what is it mom? Are you sad?' She watches me in silence, tries to smile and says 'I'm thinking of Elena.' I come close, give her a hug, touch her, just to try to make her smile. And we repeat this ritual, this talk everyday, many times a day, until I don't even have to ask. I look at her and know she's thinking of you. Almost always thinking of you. Our father, when I ask him about you, he can't speak. He only looks away in silence. Psychological report: Petra is a 7 years, 6 month old girl who was brought for psychological evaluation by her mother. The mother indicated that Petra started saying that she wanted to die and has been experiencing nightmares. There is also evidence of depression, and feelings of guilt. Petra avoided talking about her sister. Petra is using defences, which suggest obsessive compulsive tendencies in order to cope with difficult situations. She is likely to continue using these defences for a while, which permit her to deny admission of her true depression. I turn 10 and my mother and I decide to spend our vacation at the country home of some friends. They have a golf cart and I spend my days driving up and down. One afternoon, going around in circles with the cart, I realize you'd died forever. Won't she ever come back again? No. She's dead. She'll never come again. I go back to the house and realize my mother can die and think that if I thought this it means she'll really die at any moment that it's a sign and that I have to do everything that I can to avoid it. I start making promises constantly that I won't ever eat salt again, that I'll climb all the stairs to the 19th floor of our apartment on my knees, and that I'll never look at a mirror so that she won't die. I always went into the bathroom with my eyes closed. Then, like everything, the fear disappeared and you slowly disappeared with it. Until it's time for university admission exams. I study a lot, but don't know where to go what path to take. At the very last moment, I choose theatre. But when night comes, I can't sleep. Not even a minute. 2... 3... 5 days go by and I don't sleep. I start to feel that my brain's going to explode. Break down. That a piece will come out of place. Changing clothes, I hear myself talking alone. It's almost like I couldn't feel... and nothing comes back. An emptiness. I criticize myself a lot... all the time especially sex, without love it's a poison. It's like there's... a being in me that hates me. I'd dive under in this bath to erase it all, sleep forever. I look at the mirror and can't see anything behind my eyes. I started wanting to die when I was 13, up to 16. Three to four years... The first crisis I remember was in my room, I drew in front of the minor my face, in dark blue, purple, black. With many creases, as if I were old... old and tragic. Then... on the eve of Elena's death, she looked in her closet for a poster. When she found it, I saw... it was of the play Elektra, so much like my drawing. I remembered it well. She hung it on her wall the night she did the staging... of death. [PETRA] She convinces me that life's not worth it. I have to die with her. I'm afraid. Afraid of what time is going to do to me. “If she convinces me life's not worth it, Afraid of what time is going to do to me. “If she convinces me life's not worth it, I have to die with her.” What's my role... “Going over that film... What's my role... All I could've done different.” What's my role... All I could've done different.” What's my role in this film? I turn 17... 18... And feel as the hours go by I get closer to you. Until on my 21st birthday my mother looks at me and says: 'Now you're older than Elena.' The fear that I'd follow in your steps began to dissipate. But I kept on finding that you, Elena, were in me. A part of me. I stop feeling this when I started looking for you. You began taking shape. A body. Being re-born a bit, from me. But to die again... And I, much more conscious to feel your death this time. Immense pleasure, that comes with so much pain. I drown in you. In Orphellius. Where is... Where is... I perform. I perform our death to find air. To be able to live. And little by little, the pain turns to water. Becomes memory. Memories go with time. They fade. But some finale songs, just bits of relief in the small openings of poetry. You are my inconsolable memory made of shadow and stone and it is from this that all is born and dances.
