Scorpio five, this is Houston control. Communication back. Can you read me? Houston calling scorpio five. Steve, do you read me? Steve? Steve, are you all right? Communication's back. I read you. I read you. Magnificent! You've never seen anything, Until you've seen the sun through the rings of saturn. (Explosion) (Gagging) Nothing's helping. I've never seen anything like it. Why was he the only one to survive? I better call Ted Nelson. Check his vital signs every 15 minutes And replace the i.V. With units of whole blood. Yes, sir. I'll send for an orderly. No. Get it yourself. It's imperative that this be kept secret. Yes, sir. Ugh! Aah! (Nurse screams) (Screaming continues) No! No! Oh, no! On, no! (Screaming continues) (Screaming continues) (Siren wailing) All right, what have you got? Over here. Well, what do you think? Don't quote me, but this wasn't any animal. And, uh, that's not all. It gets worse. (Geiger counter chirping) Great. Now, it's not enough to harm us, Ted. But the radiation is not our real problem. We don't even know whether it's contagious or not. He shouldn't have escaped. They're not gonna like this, Ted. I still don't believe it. Uh, don't you think you better call general Perry? (Buzzing) General Perry. General Perry, this is Ted Nelson. Oh. How are you, doctor? Not too good. Something's come up, general. What do you mean? It's about Steve. He escaped. How long ago? About three and a half hours ago. Who knows about it? Dr. loring and myself. All right, you keep it that way. General, I just told you... Doctor, you listen to me. We've got to find him. We've got to get him back and reconfine him Before he hurts someone. He already has. He killed one of our nurses, general. Oh, my God. General, he was stronger than the others. That's why he lasted so long. I don't know why, general, But he seems to be getting stronger all the time. Doctor, you better come up with some answers. We've got to know. We've got to know exactly what happened Before we start to... Before tomorrow morning. I know that, general. Then get out there and find him! General, I will. Right away. You know, in all probability, he... He hung up on me. Man: * fourth street, fifth street * (Labored breathing) * 44, ah * 42 * then you're uptown (Humming) Well, no fish. How 'bout a beer? A hundred and... Yes. (Footsteps) Who's that? Anybody in there? Come on out. (Labored breathing) Who's in there? Hey, you're gonna scare the fish. Who's there? Who's back there? Come on out. Playin' some kind of game? What? (Exhales) Judy's pregnant again. Hey, that's great! Uh, great. Thanks. It's our third try, you know. I sure hope this business doesn't screw things up. How many weeks is she? Fourteen. She lost the other two about this same time. This'll be all she'll need. I suppose you'll, um, have to tell her, huh? Well, I'm not very good about keeping secrets from her. Anyway, Steve was a friend of ours. Poor guy. He must be going through hell now. I don't know. Remember now, his mind is so completely decomposed That by now there'd be no... There'd be no rational moves. Except for some occasional flashes, but no pattern. He's gonna need human cells to live on. His instinct will tell him to kill. That's why he killed the nurse. (Sighs) (Dialing) (Ringing) Hello? Dr. Nelson, this is Perry. Do you have any news for me? Not yet, I just got in. You're lucky you caught me. I'm coming down there, doctor. I'll be leaving within the hour. I'm flying a civil jet. I want you to meet me. Well, what time are you gonna get here? About 16:00 hours. And I hope to hell you found him by then. Good-bye. Damn it. Aah! Hey, what a pleasant surprise! Hey, sweetheart, I didn't hear you come in. That bastard hung up on me for the second time today. Here let me take that. That was general Perry on the phone. At least it was until he hung up on me. Why don't you just sit down and relax? I'll get your lunch. (Sighs) Steve escaped. Oh, God. What are you gonna do? Oh, did you get some crackers? I told you yesterday that we needed some crackers. Oh, I forgot. I knew there was something. There's a pad right by the phone, you know. You could write it down, too. Ted, what about Steve? So, we don't have any crackers? Ted. Steve? Steve? I've got to go out and find Steve. Why you? Because nobody else is supposed to know. Not even you, so please don't forget that fact when the general gets here. That's all I'd need. How are you gonna find him? I can use the geiger counter. I can follow his trail with it. Geiger counter? You mean he's radioactive? Just a little bit. Just a little? (Coughing) Come on, it's my turn! (Coughing continues) See, I don't cough. You don't inhale. That's why you don't cough. Well, look at what I see. Nosey. I won't tell. I'm no tattletale. Yeah, I'll bet. Wanna play doctor? Nope. Wanna play hide and seek? Yeah. If you let me try it. Ugh! (Coughing) See. (Coughing) It's awful! (Coughing continues) Come on, let's play down by the waterfall. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. This used to be our fort. Bet some big kids knocked it down. That's too bad. Come on, let's go! Let's play here. It's pretty here. It's okay. You be it. Come on. I don't wanna be it! Come on, don't be a spoil sport!

You're behind that tree. Now come on out. Now you have to come out. It's not fair. Got ya. Aah! Aah! (Labored breathing) Man: Houston calling scorpio five. Steve, do you read me? Steve? Steve, are you all right? Mommy! Help me! Mom! (Screaming continues) (Boys laughing) Girl: Help, it's frankenstein! It's frankenstein! Mommy, help! Help, mom, help! It's frankenstein! It's frankenstein! Mommy, help! Oh! Hey. Hey, honey. What's wrong, honey? I saw frankenstein in the woods! Mother: (Chuckling) Oh, Carol. There's no such thing as frankenstein. It's just a story. But I saw him! He's real! (Geiger counter clicking) Steve, it's Ted. Let me help you. There'll be no more of those scary horror movies for you. No wonder you're seeing things. There is no such thing as frankenstein. It's a story, like snow white. Can you hear me, Steve? I'm all alone. I want to help you. Steve, I want to help you. You can't survive out here by yourself. Come on back to the hospital, Steve. You can help others. We've got to find out what went wrong, Steve. (Clicking increases) (Clicking increases) Oh, no. Steve? (Clicking increases) Steve, it's me... Ted Nelson. Steve, I want to help you. (Clicking increases) (Clicking increases) Oh, God, it's his ear. Man: Lovely. Mmm. That's lovely. Lovely. Oh, yeah! (Shutter snapping) Come on, baby. Ooh, yeah.

What do you mean take my top off? Uh, I mean your top, take it off. Yeah, I know what you mean, but why take my top off? We... well, that's what we're here for, isn't it? To take pictures? Yes. Well? Well, I thought... What did you think? W-well, I thought... Well, Harry said... Look, I think there's been a lack of communication here. Okay, look, baby... Look, don't call me baby, okay? I really don't like to be called baby. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. What would you like me to call you? Honey doll? You name it. Sandra. Sandra.

Well, take me somewhere where I can change clothes. We may have a lot of hunting to do. All right. Come on, come on! Perry: I don't like the looks of that. Nelson: All right, we better check it out.

He's visiting the research center. Neil Blake. Pleased to meet you. Sheriff. Oh, Neil, would you mind if I, uh, Took a look at the body? Hell no, doc. As a matter of fact, You may be able to tell us what in blazes happened to the guy. Would you get him out of here? Beat it. (Shutter snapping) Okay. Well, doc, thought you'd be interested. It looks to me like it was done by, uh, you know, like a wild animal. You know, like a bear. No bears around here anymore, doc. You know that. Yeah. Wouldn't happen to know anything about this case, would ya? Nope. That's what I thought. Take care. Let's get him out of here. (Shutter snapping) Damn photographer. It's that photographer, damn it.

Did you find him? Just say yes or no. No. Well, are you going out again? I really don't know. Want them to come for dinner? Just a minute, and I'll ask. Would you both like to come to our house for dinner tonight? Uh, not tonight. Thanks, Ted. All I want to do is go home and get some sleep. I have to run this place while you're gone. Woman over p.A.: Dr. Samuel Rosenberg, call your office. I'll accept that invitation, doctor. We could both take a break. And it looks like we've lost the poor bastard anyway. General Perry would love to come to dinner. Okay. Oh, by the way, mother and her friend Harold are coming over, too. Judy, come on, please not tonight. Can't you... can't you call them or something? I don't think that I can take it tonight. I can't, they're already on their way. They should have been here by now. Do you think we oughta stop and call and tell them we're late? Well, they already know we're late, don't they? Maybe we should stop and buy them a gift or something. Like what? Oh, I don't know. Uh, candy or flowers. You know I don't like buying flowers. It's such a waste of money. They die so quickly. And Judy should not eat candy during her pregnancy. (Chuckling) I know you wanted the candy for yourself. I did not. I still think we should call them. We'll be there in a few minutes. I'm taking a shortcut. No, kidding. I thought this was park Avenue. Helen. Aw, baby. Mwah. Oh, not while I'm driving.

They should've been here by now. Well, have you tried calling her apartment? Yeah, every ten minutes for the last hour. What about his place? Do we have his number? No, his phone's been disconnected. Okay, listen, honey. I bet I know what happened. I bet you that old car of his broke down. There's got to be a simple explanation. So stop worrying. I'm sorry. It's just, I don't know. Steve. My mother. I'm frightened. Perry: What about Steve, Mrs. Nelson? And why are you frightened? General Perry, I thought you were taking a nap. I was. It seems I awakened just in time. Doctor, you are a civilian. But in this emergency, you're under my direct command. And I was quite specific when I told you That no information would be divulged to anyone. Oh, for Christ's sake, she's my wife. That does not exclude her from my orders. Everybody's gonna know about it by morning. (Labored breathing) Judy: He's running around murdering people! What are you two doing about it? I've never seen such a feeble excuse for a search in my life! I mean, what the hell do you expect him to do?! Come here and knock on your door?! Now, wait a minute. We don't have a minute! Judy, calm down. Would you go find her?! Calm down. No, I won't calm down! Now get out of here! Both of you, get out! And don't come back until you've found them!

(Tires screeching) (Labored breathing) (Labored breathing) (Labored breathing) (Glass breaks) Ted? Is that you? (Sighs) Elsie. (Meows) (Sighs) Oh, Elsie. (Chuckling) Look at the mess you made.

I am a doctor. I am not a policeman. I know my mother's dead. She's dead. I know my mother's dead. Judy, I told you that we never found... No, she's dead. I can feel it. She's dead. * nothin' wrong with bein' bad * I've got time to wake up * I'm only stoppin' long enough that you might need some love * * gotta get back on the road * there's still 2,000 Miles to go * * before I load her up and travel down the road * * head out on the highway * when it rains, when it snows * * made a lot of detours... * made that trip about a hundred times or so * * just about the same as every other road I know * * there's nothin' much to do but count the Miles... * * try to hear the radio above that... * * I've been out on the highway * when it rains, when it snows * * I made a lot of detours where the rivers overflow * * and home is just another place * * to take on one more load * 'cause I'm on that diesel * and i...

(Labored breathing) Nelson: Blake found my mother-in-law and her boyfriend. Steve got them. I'm gonna give Judy a sedative and go out there. Perry: Of course, doctor. All right. That is guaranteed to make you sleep. Okay, I'm gonna go out and see the sheriff now, But the good general Perry is going to be here with you the whole time, So don't worry, okay? I won't be gone long. Careful. I will. Take care of yourselves. General, would you do me a favor And stay with Judy while I go out And meet the sheriff? Of course, doctor. I'd be glad to. There's some leftover Turkey in the refrigerator If you'd like to have something to eat. Sounds good. What about you? You really should eat something before you go out. No, I'm not hungry. Couldn't hold anything down now, general. Why don't you just call me Mike. Okay. And I'm, uh, I'm sorry about before, About losing my composure with you and your lady. It's just that this whole thing's Really got me uptight. That's all right. We just weren't prepared for anything like this. It's a nasty mess When you can't go by the book. There's nothing in the book. There's no way to cope. We have just seven hours to go. Can you stop it? No way. Get back as quickly as I can. What did go on here, doc? (Police radio chatters) Listen, you better tell me what's going down around here Before there's nobody left in this town. I can't do that, Neil, it's classified. For God's sake, doc, people are dying. Judy's mother, doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course it means something to me. I ought to run you in. What for? How 'bout aiding and abetting a criminal? Oh, I wish I could tell you, Neil! I'd like to be able to tell you. Come on, doc. Now, I'm gonna find out just what is going on, And neither of us is leaving this spot until I do. That Perry character's got something to do with this, Doesn't he? Yeah. I seen plenty like him in the army. Damn it! He's got "brass" written all over him. Listen, Ted, I got a right to know. All these people that have died, They're my people, Ted, and yours. If I tell you, I want you to promise me... No. Do you or do you not want to know? I want to know. Then you tell nobody, not even your wife. All right. You know I'm not married, Ted. Okay. I'll tell you about it on the way. Now let's go find him. Find who? (Labored breathing) Steve! Aah! (Roars) I hope you don't mind. I just wanted to take a quick look in on Judy Before we started the search. Is she alone? No, Perry's with her. When's her baby due? Not for some time, yet. It's your first, isn't it? Hmm? Yes, it is. I delivered a baby once. Right back there in the back seat. Uh oh, Ted, the door's open. Hey, look, it's the general. Judy. Judy! (Crickets chirping) Come on. (Giggles) Let's go inside. That's a good idea. Ah, Nell, Jesus, did you leave the door open again? You were the last one out, not me. I was? Well, don't you remember? You went back, and you checked What time the movie started. You're right. That's right. Okay. Come here. Jesus. What the hell is this stuff? I don't know. Nell, there's something strange going on here. I want you to wait outside. I'm going in. No, I'm... Wait here. Terrific. Mm-hmm. Judy? Sweetheart, wake up. Judy? What's the matter? There's nothing the matter. You're okay, and that's all that counts. Oh, boy, I had this nightmare. Steve was outside, And he was screaming and yelling. Blake: Doc, come here, quick! What's that? Everything's gonna be just fine. I'm gonna be outside. Oh. Matt? (Door creaks) Oh, my God. Matt? (Chewing, snorting) No! Aah! (Grunting) (Banging) Operator... It's Nell. This is Nell winters. I need your help! (Banging stops) Aah! (Moans) No! No! (Shrieks) (Mumbling hysterically) What is it? How's your wife? She's okay. She slept right through it. What do you want? That thing in his hand, Think it could be part of... you know? No, I don't know. Don't touch it. It might be radioactive. I gather you haven't told me everything, have you, doc? No, I haven't. May I see your light? (Chuckles) Oh, God. What is it? What's so funny? It's a Turkey leg. General was a friend of Steve's, too. I guess Steve has really had it. Woman on radio: Headquarters calling sheriff Blake. Headquarters calling sheriff Blake. Sheriff, do you read me? Go, Nora. Sheriff, we got a call from Nell winters. She's in some sort of trouble with some guy That run in there, and he got mad, and... I'll get right on it. Doc, come on. I think we've found our boy. I can't just leave Judy here. I can have a car here in five minutes. Come on, let's go! (Thumping, bottles clanking) Nell! (Labored breathing) Pete, if you think we got trouble, Look at that dude. Don't let him hear us.

(Bell tolls) (Distant siren wails) Good morning. This is Jenny molare Reporting live from cape Kennedy. As the countdown continues As the seconds tick away, The whole world awaits the next step In the conquest of the universe. Man shall speed through the voids of space On this second historic mission to saturn. Scorpio seven will blaze new trails Beyond the puzzling and dangerous rings of saturn, And man, once again, Shall set foot on the mysterious planet. To understand the scope of this achievement In the never-ending challenge of space exploration, We should remember the last flight into space, When astronaut Steve west, Marshall McManus, and Michael Wells Paved the way for this extraordinary mission. It is unfortunate that they cannot be here today, Amidst all the excitement and joy at cape Kennedy. They are still under observation At a mobile quarantine unit Under the supervision of Dr. Theodore Nelson, However they have sent a telegram Wishing the crew of scorpio seven "Good hunting." The moments are closing in now. We shall hear the countdown Directly from Houston control. Man: Thirty seconds and counting. Astronaut's report feels good. T-minus 25 seconds. 20 seconds and counting. 15 seconds. Guidance internal. 12, 11, Ten, nine, Ignition sequence occurs, Six, five, four, Three, two, one... Lift off. Molare: Once again, Man challenges the unknown, Offering another example Of his unquenchable desire for knowledge. Scorpio seven, the world waits.
