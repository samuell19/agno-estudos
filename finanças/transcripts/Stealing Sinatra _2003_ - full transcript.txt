Ladies and gentlemen, 20-odd years ago a singer joined this orchestra. He was a skinny kid in a bow tie who drove the girlies wild. I'm not saying history repeats itself, but I'm sure not saying it won't. Would you please welcome Mr. Frank Sinatra, Jr.!

No. It's a violation of my religious beliefs. Oh. [ Laughs ] Okay. Stand next to the girls. Everyone, let's get together. Big smiles. Sweet gig, Dean. So?

The impala is amazing. Bitchin', but I was wondering... Hey, pay me back any time. Well, I will, but... Hey, that was the deal. Forget about it. No. I really wanna discuss something else. Okay, discuss. Uni. University high? I always thought we were fortunate to associate with the children of so many of our nation's greatest entertainers. News flash, Barry. They didn't give a shit. Nancy always had a smile for me. Nancy Sinatra? [ Laughs ] She didn't know you from the hind leg of a dog. That's not my perception. Okay, fine. She was in love with you. So what? She wasn't in love with me, Dean. That's a tad ridiculous. We were friendly. She's a charming girl. That's all I'm saying. She wouldn't be right. For what? Well, she'd know me, obviously, and that would make it more complicated. So I thought junior. Junior? Frank, junior. He wouldn't know who I am. Am I missing something here? I estimate a net of $100,000. I invest it. Barring unforeseen circumstances, I have a million in 10 to 15 years. I'd like to go into politics and become a senator. Where are you gonna get... From Mr. Sinatra. And why is he gonna give you... Excuse me, Dean. You're not listening. No, I heard what you said. I just don't get... For his son. To get his son back from me. You wanna kidnap... Frank, junior. [ Laughs ] Aw, you pisser! You don't think it's a good idea? You need another loan? Is that what this is about? No, it's an investment. Don't we get paid? No fish, no money. You come to see how I'm doing? I'm doing just great. Now fuck off. No shame in physical labor, Joe. You couldn't take five minutes of this. You're in L.A. making deals, hanging around with Dean torrance, driving a... What is that? Impala. '64? They don't come any newer. Well, you win. You win. The twerp wins. Is that what you wanted to show me? We weren't always the best of friends back at uni, Joe. That doesn't mean I wouldn't do you a favor if I could. I mean, hi-y club, huh? Thick or thin? Can the high school shit, Keenan, this is life now. Well, there's different kinds of life, isn't there? What do you know about it? Well, I know about opportunity, Joe. I know that it doesn't come around every day. Either you make your own or be ready when someone offers you one. Do you want an opportunity? There's a number of people involved, top class people. Who? Well, I can't... Oh, okay. One name: Johnny weissmuller. Tarzan? Junior. Johnny, junior. From uni, remember? 100 a week, huh? Plus profit sharing, if you're interested. Huh. What is it? What I'm gonna do now is use some words. Now, these are business terms, and although you may be familiar with them in the non-business world, we use them a little differently. What words? Well, for instance, kidnap. Mom? We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because... Mom? Mom? Shh. How are things, son? Selling those whirlpool tubs? I've moved on to something else now, sir. No keeping up with you, is there? I try to stay ahead of the game. What you got cooking? Well, it's... Hush-hush. Just a little. Well, don't let 'em get you down, because what's important, what's important is how a man feels about himself when he looks in the mirror. You understand? Yes, sir. Otherwise, you're jumping like a circus geek for every son of a bitch too lazy to paint his own goddamn house. Don't let that happen to you. I won't. Anything you can throw my way? Sorry? I haven't forgotten about that stock tip. That made an impression. You didn't buy it. And don't I kick myself. I would have tripled my money, wouldn't I have? He who hesitates. Story of my life. That stock worked out extremely well for a number of top class people. What I'm saying is remember your uncle John. I'd hate to miss out twice. Why you all here? Just came by to say hi, Mary. You were sleeping, so Barry and I have been discussing his future, how I might help him. Aw, Johnny. Oh, don't say it. You're more like a father than his own father. He's more like a son than my father. Why didn't I marry you? Not like I didn't ask. I loved you. Well, you just didn't wanna give up the alimony. Who's up for a little nipperheimer? Mr. Sinatra? We can't get past your car here. Here, I'll move it. I gotta go anyway. Lock the door when you're finished. Yes, sir. Thanks. Come on. But 100 a week, right? And I got a kid on the way. That's a big responsibility. Tell me about it. Mr. Irwin, hi. How are you, son? Joe, didn't I ask you to stay here and not let anyone in? He said that you needed his help. Isn't that so? Isn't that the 100% truth? Mr. Irwin, don't you work? That's not important now. What's important is that someone I feel a responsibility for is about to get involved in something way in over his head. You told him? No, we were just... You did. You told him. Let's not get into who told him. There's a plan, Joe, that I developed and you are working for me. You take orders from me. I'm the brains. You are not the brains, Joe. That's... what are you doing? Fuck this. No. You're not allowed to leave. You're already a part of this. Part of what? I haven't done anything. I'm not gonna do anything. You're not gonna do anything 'cause you're still full of shit just like in high school. Aw, shit. What's that? A gun. Oh, the twerp has a gun. All right, now you watch where you point that, Barry. I'm not pointing it. I'm merely showing you that I have it as a tool, all right? I'm reminded at this moment of a trip we all took down to Baja, Barry's mother and me... Joe is not interested. Had to catch himself a marlin, had to. You dated my mother. You did not date me. We're out in the boat. This is several years ago, and he hooked himself one. Oh, boy. And damn if he didn't tough it out for over five hours there. Didn't catch it. End of story. Turns to me... wee fella... Says, I won't forget this. Mr. Irwin, I need your help. I need your help. Oh, boy, that got to me, Barry. To be asked that got me right here. Now let's drop the temperature a bit, please? This kidnapping business, this is a serious crime. We're not seeing it that way. See it how you want. They still strapped Bruno hauptmann to the chair and broiled him like a rump roast. Why'd they do that? He kidnapped the son of one Charles a. Lindbergh, my friend. That baby never saw the light of day again and the world wept. All right, tell him, Joe. What? Tell him what I told you. You mean about Johnny weissmuller? No names. Just tell him. Well... There's a bunch of people and it's all arranged. Pre-arranged. Well, whoever these people are you're in business with, obviously, I did hear the name Johnny weissmuller mentioned, I want to tell you... This applies to you, too, Joe. You are throwing away any chance for a respectable life. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Joe? I understand you're paying him $100 a week. Right. We won't count today. Tomorrow's no good. A bastard in glendale impounded my ladders until I put a second coat on his dormers. I start Saturday. What you're doing is wrong, just plain wrong, and I'm very concerned about you both. Is that the only liquor you got in the house? Welcome to the ambassador, gentlemen. Hopping tonight. Yeah. New show in the clubroom. Who? Tommy dorsey band and frank Sinatra, Jr. Really? I hear he's very talented. Here you go. Miss, I asked for this neat. That means no ice. Well, I suppose the $8.00 cover doesn't include I'm sorry. We're not here to enjoy ourselves, Mr. Irwin. What are we here for? I've rented a house in canoga park, close but out of the way. We'll keep him there. We place a call to Mr. Sinatra, explain the terms. We just pick up the phone? Right. And call him? Excuse me, have you researched this? Huh? Do you have a Thomas guide to Los Angeles county with suitable drop off and escape routes marked in colored pen? Have you been to the library? Have you read the 1954 article in "Liberty" magazine by j. Edgar hoover? "10 mistakes every criminal makes?" Not yet. Well, I have, and that's why you listen to me. How much are we talking about, son? I'm going to write down a number. You are going to look at it, then I'm gonna destroy it. Is that a 7? No, it's a 2. A 2? 240,000. What do we get? 50,000. Each? Where are you heading, Barry? What are you doing with your life? I'm doing this, sir. Are you? Joe? When does it happen? Tonight. This? Now? Tonight? We drive to his house after the show. [ Commotion ] What's going on? Francis Albert Sinatra. Good evening, sir. What's all the hubbub, Clyde? Well, we have a young man singing. Oh, yeah? Is he any good? I think you might like him. Well, let's check him out. What do you say, chicken? Whatever you want, daddy. Okay. I can't do this, Keenan. He fucked Jill St. John. Nancy, hi. Nice to see you. It's me, Barry. Barry Keenan. Son, sit on down. She looks older. Don't sweat it, kid. It's close enough for jazz.

No, Joe. I just randomly picked an address in greater Los Angeles, hoping someone famous would be inside. His father was at the show. We're all aware of that. Maybe they went out afterwards. They still have to come home. Maybe he flew him off to Paris or something. Isn't that what he does? [ Laughs ] He's always singing about it. Well, he also sang "fly me to the moon", but I don't think they went there either. Get out of the car, Keenan. What for? So I can kick your ass. Well, I'm certainly not getting out for that. Let's go have a little talk. You ever been in the hoosegow, son? You mean jail? No. Well, I have. Well, what did you do? Call it drunk and disorderly, call it assault, call it desertion and nonsupport. But that's beside the point. You assaulted someone? What I'm getting at, it doesn't take a lot in this life for things to get well and truly fubarred. Fubarred? Oh, you've got your reasons, and, trust me, they're good ones. Let me tell you, when that man with the badge comes knocking, he just doesn't wanna hear it. Okay, Mr. Irwin. Thanks for filling me in. Now, the more I see of this, the less I like it. But whatever you do, if you're gonna be the leader, be the leader. Capiche? Um... sorry. What time is it? 3:30. My wife is gonna kill me. Can we do this, like, later in the week? Room 25. And there's three beds? Two beds and a cot. Fine. Can we get a 6 A.M. Wakeup call? Sure. Isn't there a latch or something? If there was a latch, I would have unlatched it. That's not important now, Mr. Irwin. What do we have to sleep here for? Because we are not going to screw up a second time. We will start early tomorrow, we will start fresh, and we'll be operating strictly according to plan. I'm getting a lot of pressure from the people upstairs. They are not interested in any more excuses. What are you looking at me for? What's our timetable, son? 0600 tomorrow, wakeup call. 0645, get in car. 0730, arrive 1460 Beverly Glen. 0735 to 0745, kidnap Francis Wayne Sinatra. 0830, assuming traffic, arrive 8903 Mason Avenue, canoga park. 0900 to 1500, allow uncertainty to build into concern and panic. 1515, initiate contact with Francis Albert Sinatra, the first call. [ Groan ] Is there a problem, Mr. Irwin? I'd rather not be the one on the phone. You have a very commanding voice. Well, thank you, but... Try saying this: We have your son. I'd like you to consider... We have your son. We have your son. You wanted in on this, Mr. Irwin. You can't be in and not do something. That's not being in. We have your son. Work on it. [ Bed vibrates ] [ Laughs ] Oh, sugar! I asked for a 6 A.M. wakeup, ma'am. What? ♪ Let's go surfing now ♪ ♪ everybody's learning how ♪ ♪ come on a safari with me ♪ I'm never staying there again. Son, that's a Wally's burger up ahead. Perhaps it is, Mr. Irwin. This sailor doesn't start the day without coffee. Yeah, it sounds good to me. [ Crying ] Can I do anything for you? You sure? Here. You want another tissue? Yes. [ Crying ] Do you wanna go home? I don't know. It's okay. It's all right. No, it isn't. I know. I know. Can we get some service, please? I'm sorry, gentlemen. Is she all right? Guess the news hit her really hard. What news? The president. What about him? You don't know? He... someone shot him in Dallas this morning. They shot president Kennedy. Oh, boy. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense. Three coffees. Make it quick. We're in a rush. You don't shoot the president. I don't care what your beef is, you don't do that. Poor little John-John. He's just a kid. Something's gone wrong with the country. I don't know what, but something's way off base. Put these on. Huh? So no one can see our faces. Let's go. We're behind schedule. Leave it be, son. What? A little respect. Whatever happened to the president... Barry, I say this with affection. Look at yourself. Affection and concern. What are you doing? Mr. Irwin? Mr. Irwin! I could have caught that marlin without you, but you butted in, just like you did here. And your advice is so... So stupid! All right, change of plans. It's just the two of US, but that's fine. That works. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Put on your mask. I'll catch a bus on Santa Monica or something. You are walking away from opportunity. There it goes. Goodbye, opportunity. Oh, look who's here. It's failure. How do you do, Mr. Amsler? Nice to meet you. We're not in Dallas, you know! Happy Thanksgiving. Is today Thanksgiving? A gentle reminder from his mother as John-John celebrates his third birthday, the soldier's farewell to his father. No finer epitaph can be... Thank you, lord, for this food. Amen. I'm gonna get you a color set. Mom? What happens when your life doesn't turn out the way you thought? Oh, honey... You get over it. What am I supposed to do? Go back on the boat. No, no. Well, then I'll look for work. You're not working. You're pregnant and I'm the man here. Me, the man. Well, then I suppose we'll just sit here and we'll wait for a million dollars to just drop out of the sky. Shall we just do that? I need some... Thing! Hi. How's it going? Crappy. Wanna drive to Tahoe? [ Laughing ] Wipeout. She's gonna kill me. Everybody needs a break. When you gonna make some money? How you gonna support a family? Like I haven't been trying. Like, our thing, that thing we were doing. Oh, forget about that. It's all over with. Tell me something. Was that for real? I mean, really? Come on, tell me. [ Chuckles ] Fucking Keenan. $240,000. Tahoe. Tahoe-ho-ho. Lots of casinos hiring up here. Yeah. Could land something easy. Yeah, work, ski, why not? Fresh powder. Where we staying? I don't know. What about harrahs? Is it cheap? What are those? Pills. There she blows! Well, look at that. What a coincidence. Oh, you fuck. Excuse me? Fuck you! Oh, goddamn it! Jesus Christ! You can't ignore a plan, Joe. Why not? Why can't I? Because it's a plan, and without it, where are you? No place. Out in the cold. You're a psycho. Did I stab a woman to death in the shower dressed in my mother's clothing? Jesus, did you? No. I simply made a business arrangement with a group of very well-connected individuals acting out of mutual self-interest. There's nothing wrong with that. This one's not loaded. Well, we're not getting any skiing in, are we? Are we just gonna stand here? What are those? They may be painkillers. You're in pain? Keenan? Barry? Come on, man. I'm freezing my ass off out here. Barry? Would you say some fucking thing? What do you want me to tell you, kid? Huh? Nobody forced you into this. You don't understand. What? What, your pop? [ Laughs ] He made you? Come on, get off it already. My father didn't even... Look at the charts, kiddo. There's three chords. Girls, true love, two and a half minutes you're outta there. You wanna be a star, right? I want to carry on a tradition. I want... Blah, blah, blah. You wanna be a star. Yes. Lay down some shit about surfing. Drums, guitar. You'll be coming out of every radio from L.A. to bumfuck. [ Telephone rings ] Yeah? Rex Harrison, dear boy. Looking for Helen forrest. Marvelous singer. Can't get enough of her. She there? No, wrong number. No? Isn't this room 117? No, 217. Ah. [ Laughs ] Well. Well, well, well. Cheery-bye! It's him. Who was that? Rex Harrison. Whatever happens, just watch me. Whatever happens? Play along like it's real. Here. Room service. Did you order a case of manischewitz? It's a gift from a Jewish person. Just bring it in. Come on in. Come on in. Put it anywhere. Hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay. Is this a robbery? That's right. Get on the floor. Both of you! Come on! Easy! Easy! Tape him up. Cover his eyes. Should I hit him? Nobody asked you to hit him, Joe. What are you looking at? The money's in my pants. All right, come on. You're coming with US. Come on. Out there? Did I say you could ask a question? Someone will be outside. Get up before 10 minutes, you're a dead man. Tear out the phone. Let's go. Let's go. I need my socks. He probably thinks it's a joke. What? John upstairs. Yeah, well, we know what it is, don't we? Door. Where are we going? Look, I don't want any trouble, so you just tell me what you want me to do, okay? Give him these. What are they? Painkillers? Not those. They're knockout drops. And Mr. Sinatra went with these two individuals. No, man, he didn't go with anybody. They took him. By force? Yes. I told you. The cat had a gun. The cat? The guy. Let's put it out there. You're not sleepy at all? I'm sorry. Maybe he's just not tired. You think we're fooling around here? You think we don't mean business? I think you guys got a lot of guts. We do have guts. We'll do anything. Radio. But keep it here for the latest. Hey, this just in. It looks like Sinatra fans won't be having themselves a merry little Christmas this year. What's happened? The chairman of the board has just canceled his upcoming... What is it? I don't know. Well, don't you think it's just a little bit of a coincidence? Barry? Am I talking to you? Did I ask you to chime in? Barry, look. In other news, the world's biggest strawberry... Oh, heck! Is there something wrong? Yeah. Your friend talked. You know what that makes him? What? Dead. A dead friend. What do you think about that? Can I just sit up for a second? You wanna join him? You wanna join your dead friend? [ Coughing ] No! Then just stay down and shut the effing heck up. Okay. Okay, we, uh... No. I had too much to drink. We were coming home from a party. I had too much to drink and you guys... What's your problem? I just don't want anyone... Did we ask for your thoughts? Did we? Did we? No. That's right. So just pipe down. If someone gets hurt, it's on your head. Do I make myself clear? We were at a party and he had too much to drink. That's it. Now take off the blindfold. Now get out of the car. What for? Because they're gonna be looking for three of US. Then why do I have to go? Because he can't and it's my plan. Well, I can make a plan, too, you know. I'm sure you could. It wouldn't be have Joe eat shit. Be right back. Meet US on the other side of the roadblock. Something wrong here, sir? Just checking my chains, officer. Yeah, they're fine. Quite a storm we got here, huh? Is there an accident or something? Where you headed, sir? Sacramento. You drive careful now. Will do. Slow it down. Slow it down. Slow it right here. All right. You know, this could work out very well for you. How would that happen? Well, I'm not just thinking about myself, that's all. I mean, I'm not that kind of person. Stop. Stop right there. Stop. This is a roadblock. You know what that means? You stop! Roll your window down. That gets someone killed. Understand? Roll it. Outta the car. Get your hands up. Put your hands up! Put your hands up! He's checked! What? He's already checked. I was already checked. Move it out. He's lucky. Where the heck is he? Maybe he just got lost. You know, if you didn't need other people, everything would work out fine. Sure. I bet your father's like that, huh? What do you mean? You know, a lone wolf. That's the way to be. Finally. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it. Yeah? Mr. Irwin? It's Barry. Did I wake you? I know it's late. What do you want? I'm in Sacramento with Joe and we did it. Did what? We went ahead with the plan. Are you still there? Roger that. Sir, I know I was a little brusque the last time we... It's not like I've learned nothing in my 42 years. The older you get, the more you know, the less anyone cares. Just wait. You'll see. Could you please make the ransom calls? Mr. Irwin? I can't tell you how wrong this all is. How are you feeling, son? What happens now? I'm sure you know you're involved in a major kidnapping. Of me? The only thing you need to do is tell US your parents' phone number. We could make our arrangements, get this done and move on with our lives. My father doesn't live with my mother. They're divorced. We're well aware of that. You said my parents' number. Your mother. Your mother's number. You gonna Rob her? Is that the idea? Nobody's robbing anyone. You said you were robbing me. All right, that was a lie. Then how can I trust you? You don't have a choice. You're talking about my mother. He has a point. Oh, that's right. Take his side. I'm just saying. I thought we'd try the mother first. Soften things up a little. But... fine. Let's go straight to the source. Senior? Ready, Mr. Irwin? I'd like a little more time with this. All you have to do is read it. Am I calling information? I thought you wanted to help? I'm trying to. Well, this isn't helpful. I mean, we're all in this together, aren't we? I wouldn't put it that way. Could you just give US a minute? Poor kid. Doesn't even know where his dad is. I'm not unfamiliar with the music business. I'm not gonna say any more than that. You have to trust me. All right. Now, I know I've been a little harsh to you during our situation. That's just how things have to be. What we're doing here could really be a boost for you. Have you considered that? Being a kidnap victim is not good publicity. No one's calling you a victim. What am I then? What do you want to be? A failure? A success. Me, too. Now, how do I do that? Do I call myself a victim? No, I call myself a success. I'm halfway home. You see the difference? So, Frankie, how do we reach your father? Now, I don't want to make a big deal of this, but here's a gun. I have one, you don't, okay? When I tell you don't come in... Reno. What? The elder Sinatra has set up headquarters in the mapes hotel in Reno. You can't call this bad publicity. The story at the top of the krdy newshour, roadblocks are still up in the lake Tahoe area as police search for the kidnappers of frank Sinatra, Jr. Two armed men grabbed the budding singer for his harrah's motel room late last night as heavy snow blanketed the resort... Fuck! Trumpeter John foss of the Tommy dorsey band was in the room as well and was bound and gagged by the criminals, who he later described as... We believe the kidnappers are still in the Tahoe area. We're checking motels, apartments, summer houses. Roadblocks are up and they're staying up. [ Shouting questions ] Can you tell US what Mr. Sinatra is doing right now? Waiting by the phone, hoping for good news. How would you describe his mood? Very distraught. It's all set, frank. Pick up the phone, you talk, they're on it. What kind of person, Billy? These g-men, they know what they're doing. What kind of fucking animal? I mean, they can take a hair. They murdered Jack in broad daylight like some garbage punk. Now they take my kid. Jesus Christ, what the fuck is happening to this country? Need anything? Yeah. Get me a bromo. [ Ring ] Okay, here we go. Get the tape rolling. Okay, on my cue. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] We have a go, Mr. Sinatra. Yeah? Frank? Nancy, I can't tie up this phone right now. Is there some news? No, there's nothing. I can't stop crying. I have to get off. Everyone is on it. I spoke to j. Edgar and Bobby Kennedy called me this morning. Don't be a tough guy. For once in your life, give them whatever they want. You're tying up the phone, dear. He's not like you. He's just a baby. He tries so hard to be like you and see what happens? Nancy, look. I gotta pick this up. Frank? I'll call you as soon as I hear something. [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Frank Sinatra? Yeah. Really? Who is this? Who is this? Never mind who this is. Just listen. We have your son. If you want... Cocksucking son of a bitch! If you want to see him alive again, you need to cooperate. You prick fuck! He's really mad. Piece of shit! You there? Yeah. Is he all right? He's fine. Put him on the phone. No. No. Next time. Listen to me. Just tell me what you want and we'll cut a deal here. I don't care what it costs. Just don't hurt my son. That's all I ask. Don't hurt my son. These are your instructions. Go to paradise garage, 722 west second street, Carson city. Be there in 20 minutes. We're gonna need more time than that. That's too far away. Hello? Hello? This guy is fucking with me. Sure you don't want anything? What is it? Blt with mustard and no Mayo. Okay. I can't with the blindfold. Sorry. Thanks. They're talking to your pa. Yeah? Yeah. It's all gonna work out. [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Paradise. Is frank around, please? Frank who? Frank Sinatra. Get fucked. There's a lot of bad language today. What happened? Not there. We gave him 20 minutes. [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Paradise. Frank Sinatra, please. What the heck is he trying to pull? [ Ring ] Paradise garage? Uh-huh. Is frank Sinatra... You just missed him. You're kidding. Nah, he was here with Lassie and premier kruschev and they all climbed into a Mercury capsule and took off for Mars! Excuse me, I'm frank Sinatra. Any calls for me? [ Telephone rings ] Someone wants to talk to you. Dad? Frankie? How are you, kid? Are you warm enough? Yeah. I'm... Ready to resolve this thing? Look, just tell me what the hell you want here. What do you want? A million? A million won't do it. You sick fuck scumbag. How much? 240,000, small bills, nothing bigger than a hundred. We'll call you tonight. Be at your wife's house... Ex-wife. In bel air? 8:30. Be... Could you hold on just one second? The number. Number. Could you just give me the number there? ♪ There's a crazy little ♪ ♪ shack beyond the track ♪ Mr. Irwin? Mr. Irwin?

Does that mean there's a break in the case? The FBI is handling this and I'm not really at Liberty to say. Where is Mr. Sinatra now? He is attending to personal matters. I'm sure you can understand the need for privacy here. What about a ransom, Jim? What do you know about that? Everything's being done that can be done. That's all I can say right now, fellas. Thanks very much. Please be careful with those. Don't worry, ma'am. You'll see, mom. Daddy'll take care of everything. Time to get rich. [ Telephone rings ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Sinatra. Do you have the money? Yeah, I have it right here. Wrap the bills in plain brown paper. Take it to Los Angeles international airport, a row of phone booths opposite western airlines, third booth from the left. Use the name Patrick Henry. Expect a call from John Adams. Now you listen to me. If he's harmed in any way, I swear to Christ... Hello? Hello? Hello? We'll take it from here, sir. I want you to back off. Sir? I want you to drop the money and back off till my son is safe. I don't wanna do it. It's part of the plan, Joe. One of US watches the gas station while the other goes in for the money. Get Mr. Irwin to do it. Okay, this is just between US, okay? I don't think he's the kind of person... I'm making some fresh. Just keep an eye on him. Don't do anything until we get back, all right? All right, Mr. Irwin? Roger that. What should I do with these? Put 'em in the trunk. You listen now. I'm getting out of here, and either you let me go or I'll kill you. Either way, one of US is gonna die. How about some java first? You know what the Navy taught me? No excuses. No "I meant to, but didn't," "I did, but I didn't mean it." That won't cut it, not on ship. Not during wartime. Where were you? Connecticut. It's your actions, see? It's what you do. That's the kind of man you are. I was RotC in college. You're not in college now? I dropped out. Mm-hmm. Was that the right thing to do? Everyone thinks it's easy, you know. How's that? Everyone thinks, oh, he doesn't have to try. It's all just put in his lap because of who he is. I hear you. It's twice as hard. Whatever I do, they're always gonna say... Your dad. Am I right? I've studied him. He doesn't know it, but I've followed him around all my life, the way he moves, his phrasing. No one can do what he does. I just... I just wish that... Son... Say what you will about your old man. He'd lay down his life for you. How do you know? We've been talking. He loves you. Fact. You just remember that. Okay. I'll tell you something else. You're no slouch up there. What do you mean? I heard you sing. I won't lie. You've got a few things to learn, but you've got the goods. Keep at it and don't be afraid to stand up on your own two feet. Anyway, there's my two cents. I appreciate it. Nah, you don't have to say that. No, really. Thanks a lot. Western airlines flight 427 to Phoenix is now boarding at gate 6-b. [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Hello? Who's this? Who's this? You tell me first. It's Patrick Henry. You're the wrong Patrick Henry. I'm the Patrick Henry with the money. Art's gas, oakwood and pacific, 15 minutes. Alone. [ Telephone rings ] Patrick Henry. Do you see the school buses? Put the package between them. Don't hang around. If anyone's within a mile of this place, the deal's off. What about the boy? Four hours after the pickup. Where? Be home soon, darling. Okay, hop to it. Look, very simple. Get out, walk 100 feet, pick up the bundle, drive away, be rich. $50,000, two minutes work. Open the door, Joe. Come on. What happened to Sinatra? I didn't see Sinatra. Well, that was him, Joe. That guy? Absolutely. Oh, boy. Okay, Joe. You think I'm an idiot, don't you? I do not think that... You think I'm too stupid to see what's going on here? You're not stupid, Joe. Just get out of the car. Get Mr. Irwin to make the phone calls. Get me to pick up the money. Guess whose hands are clean? Me? My hands are clean? Is that what you're saying? You're the mastermind. Figure it out. Thanks for the gratitude, Joe. Tell me I'm wrong. I give you the opportunity of a lifetime. I offer to make you rich. I introduce you to a celebrity, Joe. And all you can do at this crucial moment is stab me in the back? Honestly, thank you. Johnny weissmuller has nothing to do with this, does he? Not literally, Joe, no. Shit. That idiot! There's been a little bit of a situation. You didn't get the money. No, I got the money, but Joe panicked. He ran off. I'm coming over there. Don't do anything until I show up. If you have the money, we should let... Joe's out there running around. We let the kid go. That was the deal. No, Mr. Irwin, no! That's exactly what I don't want you to do. Do nothing. Do nothing. Mr. Irwin, what did I say? Do nothing. Good. Very good. Is everything all right? Everything's great, mom. The hours you keep, Barry. Well, there's so much to do. Here. This is for you. Buy things. I have to go. Hi, honey. Where have you been? I was just, you know, running. For three days? Well... Oh, sugar! Now, I can't tell you how to act, son, but there'll be police, FBI, reporters. There'll be your father. Right. You have to decide how you're gonna handle that. It's your choice. Be your own man. I'll try. Don't try. I will. That's the ticket. I ask one thing. Just tell 'em... Just let 'em know I did my best here. Where you want me to drop you? You sure this is all right? Yeah, it's just down the road from here. I'll call your father. He'll come pick you up. No. Well, do what you have to, but keep that blindfold on for five minutes, okay? Yeah. And remember what we talked about. Remember who you are. Now get lost. Here. What's this for? I don't know. You take care, son. Stay right where you are. Put your hands where I can see 'em. You got a destination, fella? My mother's. Hey, I know who you are. Come on. I don't think you wanna face that. Can you do me a favor? Yeah, I got a delivery for the sinatras. Yes, sir. Can I talk to you for a second? About what? Mom! Oh, my baby! My baby. Where's pop? He's driving around every street like a crazy man. He's looking for you. He is? I prayed to St. Jude. I prayed to everybody. Hi, sis. I'm okay, mom, I'm okay. Oh, thank god you're safe. I don't think I could have lived through it if you... Goddamned cocksucking reporters. Motherfucking vultures. I want them off the property. I... Pop? I, uh... I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. For what, kid? For what? Thank god you're safe. I'm just glad you're home. Thank god you're home. Like a de-humidifier for their home. Number 4. [ Applause ] Number 2! [ Applause ] 50. 50. 140. We got away with it, didn't we? Got away with it? Yeah. Would you say Thomas Edison got away with the light bulb? Mr. Irwin, don't stand on ceremony. Roger that.

Jimmy. What's going on? Just driving by. Thought I'd stop in. All righty. John? Sue. Did I wake the kids? No, no. Can I get you a... No, no, no. I'll just sit down on the porch. Roger that. Coffee. Thanks. The paper came. Uh-huh. I done something bad. What's that? No excuses, are there? Not that I heard. Not in these United States. Well, let's do what has to be done. Jimmy. Johnny. Sue. John. Thanks for the use of the hall. Let's weigh anchor. Great. So what do we do with your brother's truck? Hey, Dean. Barry, what's going on? Came by to drop something off. What is it? Take a look. 25,000. What's this for? Your share of the profits. First in, first out. That's good business principle. Goddamn it, Barry. Why didn't you tell me? You were the first person I told. I couldn't have done it without you. I don't want this. I don't wanna see it. I don't wanna know. I turn on the radio, Dean. There's your song coming out of it. Girls run up to you on the beach. You don't know how it feels to just be like everyone else. I'm gonna leave this here. In case you want it, there it is. How do you like the t-bird? It's fine. Thinking of trading up. It's a beautiful day, huh? No place like californ-i-a. So what else should we know, John? Wanna tell US the names of the others? I don't think so. Why not? Doesn't seem right. Well, you already mentioned Joe. I did? Yeah. You said Joe watched the kid. So there's a Joe. We're pretty sure there's a Barry and we know you were in canoga park. You do? Might as well get it off your chest. I have this. No point in holding onto it. Old time movies and have a lot of fun. I wanna introduce you to, right now, my friends, this is white fang, the meanest dog in all the United States. Mrs. Joseph amsler? Joe, it's for you. [ Singing in French ] Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present to you, hailing from the golden state, the youngest senator in our great nation's history, accompanied by his lovely wife, the former miss spirit of the mayflower. Would you all please rise and welcome the right honorable... Barry Worthington Keenan? Yes? You're under arrest for the felony kidnapping of Francis Wayne Sinatra. Oh, heck. Put out your hands. Was it hard to catch me? Not really. Hold on one second, please. I was scared, a little bit nervous, naturally. But all I could do was hope for the best. Do your feel your close personal connection with director hoover... Look, the story here is this kid and he's been through a lot and he's kept his head. See? And his mother and I are just happy he's home and safe. Excuse me, Mr. Sinatra... Right there. We brought that family together. Doesn't that count for something? Like they say, Barry, no good deed goes unpunished. Let's just try this. Yes? What would you say if I told you that this whole thing was a hoax planned in advance with the full participation of Mr. Sinatra and his son to benefit his career? And how would it do that? Well, obviously, you're not familiar with the music business. No, but I'm familiar with confessions and we got yours right here. What are we looking at? For kidnapping? For kidnapping, we're looking at life. Your whole life? Every little bit of it. Last question. Shoot. Can criminals be senators? Maybe, but they have to be senators first. Well, I better get cracking.
