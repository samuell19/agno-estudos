This... this is a promise I made to my Brother Master, the daredevil warriors are here They're the best junior chiefs who've been with us for more than five years Greetings to you, Master! How dare you betray the gang and burn our slave boats Tell us the names of your conspirators Perhaps the Master will spare your life! No way! I'd never betray my buddies! You kidnapped and sold us to foreigners as slaves It's a disgrace! We're not paid to be treated like cheap goods We're flesh and blood, with wives and families, not some...

Congratulations on taking another adopted son! Hang his severed head in the arch Let everybody know who runs the pier now! Yes! You can't die! Not like this Getting this position wasn't easy for you These wounds would be been for nothing I'm lucky After all, I can have a decent meal You have to get well, no matter what! Yeah... You waited for me? You saved me once too, remember? Last month at the theatre. On the 9th. You forgot? You're mistaken No way! You're so ugly. I wouldn't have forgotten And anyway, we're buddies now! I've always wanted to be a tough guy backing up a tough guy My father used to be a great boxer His Eight Trigram Pole was formidable But he got addicted to opium and sold my siblings Enough of him! Let me tell you my story... I'm actually a good man I wasn't like this seven years ago... Hey, Wake up! If you don't want me to die... Shut up! Rest. Don't talk so much Once I master this, I'll teach Little Fiery I don't want to learn Play it again Brother Fei! Little Fa is in trouble The villainous Master Li has to take her away Let's go! Go! Move! Move! Let go of her! Please don't take my daughter! I'm begging you! - Mom! - Please, let her go! Move! I'll kill you! That's the head of the North Sea Gang, Master! No Don't Father, forgive me I wasn't a loyal son Young Master- I swear to avenge your death! My father's been killed by the Black Tiger Gang And you hand over all your ships' business to them? The North Sea Gang hasn't had problems before... Even the opium dens followed your rules What is the meaning of this? Where's your respect for the principles of the underworld? I don't know the rules of your underworld Or the struggle between you and the Black Tiger Gang We don't care Whoever has the leverage here, the foreign traders will do business with them All right! You'll see! Young Master- You've been burned? When I was young... Scars are forever! It must be a sign from God- This scar looks just like a tiger! You're now the gang's adopted son At the level of North Evil, Black Crow, and Old Snake To help Master take care of business at the pier The opium den, gambling parlor, Courtesan boat... And the money vault... Money from the businesses is kept in a vault? You need two keys to open it: one's Silver, the other's Gold. Master Lei owns a set The other is held by the two sons with the highest- earning businesses Which two are the best now? Of course there's Black Crow, who handles the gambling parlors And the crafty Old Snake! Both must be present to gain access to the vault to monitor each other and share responsibility no one else has the key It's useless, even if you knew the location Little Fa has been taken by Villain Li Father! I beg you, please kill him There're more than one villain in this world Dad! Kill him! Where is she? I already sold her, there's no point in beating me over it! Come on board and relax, Master!

We, the Orphan Gang Shall stand against the Black Tiger Gang And pay respect to all the lost souls at the pier! Brothers! Drink up! Drink up! Yes! If you want to command respect- They have to fear you If someone dares defy you, you're no longer a threat Eliminate the North Sea Gang once and for all And let the people know who's in charge This year the Black Tiger Gang ruthlessly pursued its enemies, while the son of the North Sea Gang avenges his father's death And as I had predicted, the Black Tiger Gang finally took over the pier And I truly became another vicious Tiger under Master Lei Go! Get lost! Fei Father! Little Fa! You've cried out the name Little Fa thrice tonight Bad dream again? Maybe Little Fa has drifted into prostitution How about this You can call me Fa if you like Perhaps it can ease your longing No Sorry, no offense I understand, don't be so serious I know, you despise me for being a prostitute My hands are filled with blood, I'm not pure as well It's fine as long as the heart remains pure My father, a brilliant doctor and a master at Tiger- Crane double fist, started the medical hall to save the lives of those in need Yet in the end, he lost to the might of a torch Save us! Quick, get out! Fei, take them away from here first - Father! - Teacher! Have you seen Little Fiery? No Fiery! Fiery! Little Fiery! Leave me! Go before it's too late! We'll be brothers again in our next life! I don't care about the next life! Your life is my life now! Go! Father! Teacher! Teacher! This way, please... Young Fourth Master is here Young Fourth Master! Please- Come, let's toast to him! Yes! Fourth Master, please- Sit! Why does Brother North Evil carry a cane like an old man? He's talking about me You think that's funny? Allow me to toast our little brother Sure, no problem Here- A toast to him? A lesson from me! What's wrong? I thought you were a good fighter The so- called Shadowless Fist! Why not show us? Shadowless Fist is impossible to detect I dare not disrespect big brother Big brother? He's just older. He'll die sooner Come on! You sent someone to kill my men at the gambling parlor last month You think I didn't know it was you?! They deserve to die! So what? Who wants to fight? Master- You want to fight? Then get rid of the North Sea Gang! Here's the porridge I have two fish here! Give me your hand Why? I bought it some time ago... but wanted to give it to you at the right moment, and I never know when's a good time When I bought it, the shopkeeper asked me if I was getting it for my future wife... I've gotta check the porridge Should I play a tune? Yes I found a great job recently The foreigners refuse opium addicts for overseas labor So I'll be a stand- in, giving my thumbprint for the medical check I pass the test, they put the addicts back, and everyone ships out Look at this- I got a silver ingot just for doing that! I can recommend you guys. Wanna go? - Wanna go? - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! They say you're the most powerful man in Guangzhou What do you mean? We need 300 strong Chinese laborers next month So far, you've only sent 130. How come? You think getting 130 is easy? Did everyone forget that boat incident two months ago! 400 workers burned to death! It's a scandal, and the whole town knows Who's gonna want to sign up for overseas work now? It'll take time,even if I kidnap all 300 workers We don't have to give you this business, you know. If you can't deliver, there are many others who can I can deliver. Just give me two weeks They asked me to kidnap 300 strong workers Just for five lousy ships' business! The foreigners are indeed ravenous They're signing up to work overseas no need to use the pier workers Seems like my son... He's got a kind heart It's not kindness... but righteousness And let me tell you what righteousness is- Be good to those who treat you well This is righteousness You and me? Neither of us are in a position to speak of it We have to work with the morals of our time I believe a real hero leads the way, not just follows along I remember saying similar naive things when I was young You've gotta be ruthless to run this turf Humans are no difference from ants- you'll see this in time. Have you found the old man's son? He's hidden himself well From now on, send fewer bodyguards to protect me I'm sure it'll lure him out Yes We have steamed buns for everyone, come have some Get up and have a steamed bun! Wake up! A customer asked me to narrate two new stories: "Liu Bang Slaying the Snake," and "Wu Song Beating the Tiger" How Liu finally defeated the Chu warlord and unified the country Most importantly... Fiery, we may not survive the vengeance Let's be brothers again in the next life! Ah! How can I take my revenge now? Get up, Villain Li! I want my revenge! You two come with me! No, these villains were killed by another gang of villains I don't want to go with you- I want my revenge! Come with me! Ah! You wanna leave? There's two options: Answer my questions- correctly- or learn martial arts well enough to defeat me What's the question? What is Vengeance? For punishing your enemies! Wrong! What is Vengeance? An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth Wrong! To get rid of fear, you must forge ahead into the darkest corner! What is Vengeance? To be more vicious than the most ferocious person out there Seek out our enemies, and take revenge on them Wrong! No matter how we answer, it's always wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! All Wrong! What are we wrong about? "I, I, I!" You're wrong to mention "I" Look into the fire, what do you see? I see hell! I see rage! What I see... is graciousness and sacrifice! Your father sacrificed himself for the sake of others It's easy to kill. Far harder to save. Your father told me once, I teach you martial arts to save people! Remember, no matter how tough things are Never give up saving another life! True Vengeance... is to save lives! To save people from the flames of hell! You two can leave whenever you want Clothes mending! Need anything mended? Miss, are you skillful? I'm very skillful with collars Thank you, Miss! Go ahead Old Snake... He has the Gold key. Old Snake is here Go away, get out of here! Go away, get out of here! Go away, get out of here! After him! Stop there! You there! You there! You there! - After her! - You there! You there! Be quick! You there! You there! You there! A pretty young girl like you? How dare you mess with me! Ah! Ah! Ah! Old Snake? You don't deserve to be a Snake! Not even a worm! Ah! Who are you? Ah! I'm me. We're are the Orphan Gang Stinks! Who kicked him in there? This must be the Gold key for the vault Put the key back! I heard it's a group called the Orphan Gang Stinks! Evil has its retribution? Whoever wrote this must be out of his mind! Master, luckily the key is not lost You'll keep the Gold key From now on, you and Black Crow will be responsible for the money vault Thank you, Father! Thank me? Am I giving you the money vault? No, thank you for trusting me I don't deserve this honor Perhaps this key... should be kept by Fei or Black Crow I'm not good at keeping things I only know how to fight You don't want to control the vault? Maybe you'd rather control me? Those who don't seek small profits carry a bigger ambition What is your big ambition? I only want... what you want You've got nerve! Daring to smile when you should be scared Just like me! Catching a fish requires patience For you! Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it! Triple four! Pay up! Pay up! - Great! - What luck! Let's go! Great! Luck is on my side! Nothing can stop me All in! Three three one! Seven points. Small Lemme borrow 50 silver ingots You're the new Fourth Young Master No problem! Bring 50 ingots to the new Fourth Young Master! Place your bets! Place your bets! Triple Six Hey, big bro! Five Five Six. Sixteen points. Big. Darn, just off by a little! You must be having problems with the silver ingots! Lend me another 50 silver ingots! Brother, brother, no! All in! Triple One! Banker takes all! Another 50 silver ingots! Six Six Two. Fourteen points. Big. Another 50 silver ingots! Three three one! Seven points. Small. Another 50 silver ingots! Another 50 silver ingots! Fourth Young Master, it's against the rules You're putting me in a difficult situation I want another 50! Hurry up and bring it out! Bring it out! What's all this fuss! I want 50 silver ingots! How dare you! Take this 50 ingots as a welcome gift Big brother- I want 3000 silver ingots Are you kidding me? I mean, I want 3000 as a gift, not a loan You looking for trouble? You better stop it With these debts, I have reason to kill you, and Father can't blame me. How much do you think this's worth? How did you get this Gold key? From Old Snake, of course Someone tried to make a mold and I caught him red- handed Who? North Evil's minions North Evil? He wants the money vault? So you're hereto make a business deal You should give this to Father, but you brought it here instead You're betraying the gang It takes the Gold and Silver keys to open the money vault I don't have the Silver key or know where the vault is This key means nothing to me. It's hardly some deadly crime Since it's useless here, I'll give it back to Father Looks like you're not leaving without a win tonight That depends on the dealer Come to think of it, 3000 silver ingots is far too cheap If I have to choose between you or North Evil to benefit from this I'd rather it be you North Evil knows you have this? Of course not! I already killed that minion He'd never imagine the Gold key's with you now Since North Evil has his heart set on getting the vault, he might have killed Old Snake If that's the case, you'll be his next target! Perhaps you've already been stabbed in the back I have to try this key first If anything goes wrong, you won't get away with this Big Brother, you're playing it safe? Showing me the vault to get me involved Master Liu asked us to come Finally caught the big fish Fourth Master, your fish! It's for you! Fourth Master! Here's a peanut for you! It's a map! Miss, your dress has been mended Men are so impatient, always tearing off my collar Fortunately, you're a good seamstress My mending skills are good. Take a look Tomorrow How come she won't turn to look at you this time? You like Chun, why don't you tell her? If it'll hurt Fiery... I'd rather give up Chun But Chun likes you How do you know? When I told her my collar was torn by you All right, next time I'll tell her you just hide here Up to you Since you three are good friends, why can't you be frank about it? Let Chun choose whoever she likes Maybe three of you can stay together forever You like to joke I envy her If I was her, I'd seize Not for the man But for the heart Master, this way! Master, this way! Master, this way! Where are the workman chiefs? Follow me! You are a collector of weapons They are not mine They belong to my enemies They're my most loyal friends Accompany me in every battle They will never betray me Do you know what I'm thinking of when seated? Your business? I'm thinking who else wants to kill me? No need to be paranoid! The entire Guangzhou Pier is your turf now Old Snake's death tells me... Someone's conspiring against me Know why I bring you here today and you alone? I want you to feel the joy of uprooting a problem Lei! If my father didn't help you build this turf at the pier, you wouldn't have anything today And you No need to lure me out I will definitely come for you Can you manage? Yes I can! He can't No you can't - Father! - Careful! Do it! I don't want to kill you If you're not dead, what's there to live for? Don't hesitate, show no mercy! I didn't kill him, you did Everyone! Get out! Get up! Everyone get out! Get out! Get up! Help! Help! Stay there! Be quick! Round him up from the front! That's the arsonist! Be quick! Round him up! - Stay there! - Be quick! Round him up! Don't run! Good- for- nothing! Get him! Stay there! Get him! Get him! Stay there! Over there! And here! Master, the opium dens are on fire! Father, I'll go check! Stay there! That way! Brother Black Crow! Brother Fei Where's the girl? It's a trap! You're with them! You're not stupid, just greedy Do you remember my parents? Ma Yin Shun and Tsui Lai Leung from the Guang Yuen Escort Service? They were just ordinary armed escorts They refused to join your gang and you killed them I, Ma Chun Yuk, swear to avenge their death today! Giving me the Gold key was your first step Getting my Silver key is the second, and there's the third- It's been four years... and we've never been able to say a word to one another I see you when I pass the Courtesan boat It's only a glimpse, as you cross the bridge No one would notice Last time... Why didn't you look at me? I don't want to see you two together It's my fault But you keep tearing off her collar... And it takes a lot of work to mend it A gift from Fiery When it's over, I'll tell him about you and me. I've waited so long to hear you say this Trust me Just one more move We're almost there Stay alive- you promise me! He refuses to talk Come- Beat him up! Make him give up his accomplices! No need for that My brothers are awfully busy right now The money vault! You stay here! There's money to be distributed at TongRen Lane! Money will be given to the poor for free! Master- While we put out the fires at the opium dens, the poor raided the money vault Where're the guards? They're all dead Fetch Black Crow and North Evil now! You'll be all right - Listen - I'm here Let's fight our way out! I won't leave! Tell Chun... I love her very much You tell her yourself Let's go! I don't have a chance I've always wanted to take her from you... but now- she'd be better off in your hands I don't want you to do that Let's fight our way out! What's wrong with you! Listen! You can't give up our dream just to save me Burn down the opium dens, open the money vault, right? If this sacrifice saves 300 innocent workers There're plenty of fathers out there Save them, so their kids won't turn into orphans like me This is everything we've worked for, isn't it? I can't watch you die and just do nothing I can't do it! Don't forget the mountain. What we promised. Don't make me die with regrets! How can I forget? I didn't forget! But don't make me live in guilt for the rest of my life Without you, our dream... You picked the hell divination stick Stay... Fulfill our dreams You once said- my life is your life, remember? Today I'll repay You From now on- My dream is your dream! With one shared life, I won't have regrets What a pity- no more peanuts Get lost! I won't say a word! You know how many people died for those silver ingots? What are you people doing? It's for our dream! To bring down a man like you! There must be a mole in my gang Otherwise you wouldn't be able to open the vault Bring me scissors! Kill me! Go ahead! Fei- Cut his tongue out! Why must you take it this far? Why must you take it this far! Do it! Kill me! Cut! Master! Master! Black Crow has been killed Check the Silver key on him! Ahhh... Hmm. Father- There's no key! But strange... Black Crow's body... a wound so similar... What're you implying? Father, Black Crow and I had our differences, but I can't kill him We didn't even have a chance to fight I've been framed This is a setup! This person killed my two sons and raided my money vault He must have wanted to wipe out the Black Tiger Gang So that he could replace me and reap the benefits Father- I've been in this gang for 13 years I've never done anything wrong I didn't say it was you! Father, please- wait a second Tell me who killed Black Crow Which among us is your guy? If you refuse to speak, I'll make you beg for mercy Speak! I'll say! I'll say! That's more like it What? Louder! Tell me! Say it properly! I've made an oath with my brother Don't cry for me! Father I didn't kill him What did he say to you? He set me up! He sacrificed his life to set you up? How unfair to you! Now it's a challenge? That's what I love! Hang him on the arch Come on Brother, let's go! The only way to save people from hell is by going there yourself Brother One of us has to step into this hell in order to rip them from the inside Draw one! The long one is the hell divination stick I'm so afraid you'll snatch the hell divination stick If I die... promise you won't avenge my death The one left behind must accomplish our dream This is... our promise! Even if we get rid of this gang, another one will take over It'll never end In five years, I'll be the most feared person here, conquering all the bad guys I'll unite all the orphans, and together we'll take them down Why am I here? Last night you came back and said Fiery had died Fiery died And you passed out You even cried in your sleep He was my best friend He died in front of me and I couldn't save him I don't know if all this is worth it anymore You guys did something we never would have dared Do you know... When the poor got those silver ingots, they cried? Everyone was happy Watching those opium dens burn... It gave them hope You always told them to stand up and fight, right? Fiery is dead Fiery is gone Fiery is gone Fiery is gone I'll never be able to get out of this hell Look at me Other people can, because of you It's useless Until now- I couldn't figure out where they hid the 300 missing workers 300! It's North Evil's business Lei didn't let me get involved North Evil is starting to suspect me I have to move fast If I'm going to rescue them in time Why not just find a way to kill Lei? No If we do... North Evil would be the new Master of the gang The pier will still be held by villains, just a different leader You've got to deal with two villains I wish I could help you like Chun does Fourth Master, someone's here for you Fiery! This was a brilliant man His name was Zhuge Liang Also known as Kongming, the "Sleeping Dragon" He knows astronomy and geography... He's well- respected by everyone Understands Yin and Yang, the Eight Trigrams... I want to hear the historical story, "Ambush on All Sides" And "Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar" Father! Master! Why are you so late? Brother- Where were you last night? I found Young Master at the Courtesan boat The Courtesan boat? How can you be in the mood? A great show's about to begin We've got the place surrounded If they make a move, we'll wipe them out ...lining up, just as Kongming told them to And as the auspicious hour approached, Kongming fasted and bathed Put on a Taoist robe, and went to the altar What happened then? Now, the story of the fight between Chor and Han in the Warring Period "Ambush on All Sides" and "Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar" Why not the Story of Three Kingdoms? Who dares to tip them off? The mole is here! No one's allowed to leave I've been here all morning and haven't stepped away Definitely has nothing to do with me No one said it's you. Don't try to blame it on others Bring me the Storyteller! May I ask who this Master is? Tell me, who asked you to tell these two stories? Yes... Indeed, a man paid me earlier and asked to hear these stories But I'm blind, so couldn't tell you what he looks like. How about his voice? Could you recognize it? The blind have the best ears Each of you come up and say the words into his ear Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar Including you two! Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar Ambush on All Sides, Invitation to Step into the Heated Jar We opened the money vault and burnt the opium dens Through which door did you two come in? Because we're late, we came in through the back door Without crossing the market? No! Fourth Young Master Master has to deliver some cargo to the leprosarium for the foreigners Your service is required this time Sure Master will personally deliver? What cargo? Medicines for the leprosarium North Evil used to be responsible, but this time- Master has to do it But then... Please don't ask me anything more How is it? I've ordered all the bathhouse customers to leave You guys stand guard Don't even let a fly get in Why does a Courtesan boat girl come here? I've come to see Master North Evil I am Orchid, from the Capital Courtesan Boat I have information for him. About the money vault A Capital Courtesan boat girl is here to see you Capital Courtesan boat? The one Fei frequents? You're Fei's woman. What do you want from me? I won't believe a word you say My words will kill him Why wouldn't you believe me? You're just some woman With no family Why betray him? Sooner or later, he'll be exposed I'd better find a more stable sugar daddy I heard he only visits your boat He must treat you very well We've known each other since we were young My nickname was Little Fa We used to be very close But later we were separated We met again three years ago at the Courtesan boat I saved him once- So he trusts me That's how I know his secrets Don't play games with me What secrets do you know? I know he killed Black Crow- how's that for a start? I knew it was him! It was his idea to open the money vault He stays in the gang so he can find the 300 missing workers... And I love him. I was going to stay with him forever But then I learned... I'm not the one he loves My heart is broken I have to find a way to protect myself. Tell me What kind of reward do you want? Master North Evil... I want you. My body is... Feeble. I'm frail, and can't walk steadily... Without a big rock like you, I won't be able to survive Will you take me in? We're hereto deliver the medicine Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I said shut up! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! You want to kill me? Kill you! You want to kill me? It's not so easy to kill someone You know why I'm still alive today? I have eyes all over my body We'll deliver them to the boat on the 15th of next month A feeble woman like that- she wants to kill me? This little brother is really naive To incur a double loss Nowhere to hide You can't go through that wall! This is for the people you've killed! How can I let you sacrifice yourself? Why get involved in this? I'm a prostitute. This is the only way to get close to North Evil If I can use my body to kill this monster, that's redemption enough. Besides... If I do this, I can have Fei's heart forever I've always envied you. I've been jealous, even You can do whatever you think is right But through my whole life, I've never had a choice Promise me- No matter how bad the situation gets Don't come near me I can't bear to see you in danger North Evil is very cunning If I don't succeed, you still could As long as we achieve our goal, the sacrifice doesn't matter She is Little Fa Why tell me in such a way? Why would you tell me in such a way? I know why... She wants to be in your heart forever We still have to accomplish what we have to do Now we know where the kidnapped workers are Spread the news about the leprosarium quickly It's time to start a revolution You once asked me who's in my heart Now I know Fei! Help me put this on for Fiery Let's remember his righteousness! Brother- It's time for us to fight back I, Wong Fei Hung, will never forget our dream I hereby swear- I will unify the people, Rise up against all opposition, And stand up against all evil Unity!
