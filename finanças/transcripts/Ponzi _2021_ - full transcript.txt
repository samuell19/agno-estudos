Where did you expect us to live? - On trees? Jumping around with monkeys? - Aye, aye! I'm sorry. That's… That's my bad. I deserve that. Okay, I'm sorry. Geez. Is there like a pool around here? Yep. Right around the corner. And a gym and a sauna and whatever it is… you want. Bro, welcome, welcome. Aye, you don't need to do that. - It's alright. - Welcome. - Thank you, brother. - Welcome. Thank you. Why is he cleaning my shoes? But yo, listen. I… I got to thank you. For what? For welcoming me into your home like this. This is, uh… This is super cool. I know it can't be easy. It's probably a little awkward. Up until last week, you didn't even know you had a half brother. But… Honestly, I um… I appreciate this. This is really cool. It's what family does. - It's super cool. - Right? Tsk. I actually wouldn't know. Geez, look at that painting. Yup. Chief Olaoba. Career politician. My father, casually told mother that I wasn't his only child. Just last week. Surprised? I wasn't. It's what you get from a loving father, who also happens to be a philandering husband. Poor mom. She was totally blindsided. Blamed herself for not giving him a son. Robert was born only a few months before I was born. See, if they will cheat they are going to cheat, my dear. Hey, what's good? - That's her? - Yes. Jesus Christ. You don't surprise an old woman like that. Like… You said old? Is she? Did you just say old? Geez Mom, look at you! Oh, what is she like 31, 32? Oh man. This is, Mom, this is something else. Yo, can I? Is it okay? - Yes. - You sure? Hi. This, Actually, I said I wasn't going to do this. This is ah, it's a little much for me. Mom… Is it okay if I call you mom? I have been looking forward to meeting you for quite a while. Alright, I have been practicing this, but I just wanted to make sure I… I let you know how I felt about you. To be honest, I spent most of my life in foster care. And it was fine. That's not… my problem. The whole time, all I wanted was a strong powerful woman to be able to look up to and say that's… that's my mother. So when they told me you would allow me to live with you. I just… I just hope, I just hope that you can see me as… as the son that you never had. Cause I love you, Mom. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - Is that my son? - Daddy! - My own Robert? How you do that? How you do that thing? Do you just? Huh? Get up, son. Oh my. - You are welcome home. - Thank you, Daddy. Aw man, this place is something else. Come to me. Yeah? Aw, thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. If I hit this one now, ehn! Still sleeping. Like father, like son.

Uh… Hey sis. It's only you, sorry. Sorry, I… I forgot where I was. - Hmm! - Forgot where I was. What's going on, Sis? - Cause I was just about to... - No, no, it's fine. What are you doing here? How long have I been out? Not that much. Only about 17 hours? Shit, I must have knocked out. Nice Rolex. Oh, yeah. It's a… It's nothing. What was it you did in the USA again? Uh… Business. Investments. The usual contracts and shit. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. And "The motherland" is worth leaving all that for? Ever heard of Black Lives Matter? You can't put a price on freedom. - Cannot put a price on freedom. - Ever heard of End SARS? You ever heard of fun? Geez. - What's with all that - What? Hard conversations? Seriously, what do you guys do for fun over here? Uh… I think I'm going to go look around, have some… adventures of my own. What's good? Are you coming? I'm awake! What's going on, guys? Who's at home? - Okay. - Ah, let me see it. - Ah cool. Is this the place? - Oh my God, yes. Motherland, baby. We made it to an African spot and uh... Can we have two potions of chicken please.

You know? How do you build a future on luck? It's kinda of like two-timing in a relationship. Hmm? Oh, I don't think it has anything to do with that. What's the endgame? Just stay somewhere and invest. - Ah, you have started again. - It's simple economics! Aye baby, but investments crash. Ehn, investments crash. Divorces happen. Look at my folks, did they not get divorced? They divorced. All I'm seeing it as is that in this life, everything we do is all part of a risk. It's all calculated gambling. It's all a bet. But, some investments are worth betting your life on. Are you people the only ones in this house? Wait, what you just said now are we still talking about investments? because… - Okay. Thank you for walking me home. - Okay. - Goodnight - Goodnight. This is insane! Oh What…? What? - Bye. - Goodnight. One person who seemingly shatters barriers of class within the motherland. One person to inspire a notorious player. You guys having a good night? - Yo, so, y'all know me, right? - Yes. - Americana! - No, no, no. Stop that. I told y'all don't call me that, alright? Call me "Motherland", if anything. I got to tell you the truth, okay? All of you… It's alright, I got this. To be honest, I am sick and tired of systems that only oppress the poor and empower the rich. See what I'm saying? No, no, cool it. I see this shit everyday. Back home in the States, it's the same thing. Different shit, same day. It's called systematic classicism. Boss, what is systemat… the English you're speaking is too high. Not all of us are educated. Even Wole Soyinka would need a dictionary to understand what you are saying. It's cool. It's cool. I'm going to break it down for you. Every single person in this close, is about to be stinking rich! Yeah. So listen, tell them I got people in the States… - Okay. - …who got everything sorted out. Alright. Website is ready. Platform is ready. Got investors and everything. If anyone is going to make money it's going to be my people making money. You feel me? Americana! - Its gonna be my people. - Americana! That's what I am saying. - Thank you. Thank you. - Americana. "I wanna, I gonna" does not work here. "Something, this thing," is not what we want to listen to. Show us the way! Welcome, Charles. Someone get him some snacks and everything. Thank you for joining us. - Someone bring suya for Baba. - Thank you for joining us, Charles. So, I have been with you guys for two months, right? You wanna take that baby out of the hood? You've been trying to make music for how long? Ah! For 30 years! In fact, there's an album I'm planning for. Let me just give you free styling. Hey, behave yourself! Charles. Shit, I know you got money. But let me ask you something. How would you like to make more money in 30 days than you make in one year? There is zero chance my dad is going to let her marry some nigga who is still living with his brother hustling off bets and shit, waiting for government contracts to come through. Hey, hey hey, guys! C'mon, c'mon. There is nothing wrong with being broke. But today we change all of that. Reachvest. That's the idea. See ehn, even if all he said was "rich," it would have still worked! We know ourselves! Last time, all it took was green white green logo. And Tales by Moonlight. Which told us of Russian millionaires, with lofty dreams of setting up the company, because they were on a mission to eradicate global poverty. Stories that touch. We know ourselves! Boss, tell us about this Reachvest, let's understand how it works. You've whetted my appetite but tell us more. With Reachvest, we invest in the US Gold Treasury. Huh? - Gold? - Let him talk first. - Let me ask you something. - Gold?! - Hit my chest! - How much do you think that's worth? It is worth 493.4 billion dollars. Will you all shut up? The people who don't even understand English are also shouting. I am surprised at you all. See, if its true, I will give everyone here money to invest. This is the problem. You don't fully understand and you're already cheering. I am collecting interest. - No problem. - My interest is set at 100%. It is gold that we'll be making here. Americana! Americana! Americana! Americana! Americana! - Americana! - Give him space. Ahn-ahn! You haven't set up... Look at these people. Since morning, you haven't set up simple table! What kinda of... What's wrong with you all? Ah! Come, DJ. DJ Mad, why are you not playing any song? You haven't given me any song. Oh, so because I haven't given you the song, you can't play any other song?

But Rob is still being a bit iffy about stuff. - Baby, nothing will happen. - Fifty returns don't happen like that. Don't worry. Everybody will register! Everybody will become a billionaire! - Who is this? - Ahn-ahn! - Ahn-ahn? What's the problem. - Hey, y'all should calm down. How can I help you? Do you think you're the only one who likes good things? But when people were trying to register before, you were complaining. Please before you borrow from Charles, let me do my own research. - Hmm? - Hmm? Baby, that's bad vibes. This man has proven himself. What else does he have to do? Next, next! Okay. I am sorry. C'mon, give him form. At least let me bring the money for the next investment. - No need. - Please, don't go to Charles. That guy is bad news. Okay. I agree. - You're sure? - I promise. - Okay. - Can we make a baby now? - I love you. - And I love you. Obehi, um, take that and give that to the driver. Hey, dad. - You okay? - Hey, son. Yes You going out? Baba, give me. - Too much money! - Baba, give us money. Just make them happy. Got you. Make them happy. More money! - More money! More money! - I hail you, =Baba. More money! - Baba! Baba! - Baba, they've gone home. Baba oh! Baba oh! Everybody will register. Hey, wait! Face there! - Boss Charles! - Face there! I will fix it, I will fix it. You're mad! - Please! - You are mad. Don't turn around. - Idiot! - Boss Charles, please. Where is my money? Boss Charles, please! I will give you your money. You have the audacity… Listen, listen. Quiet! Quiet! If you want to sell your house, sell it. If you want to sell your kidney, sell it. It's none of my business. All I want is my… - money! All I want is my money! - Boss Charles! - Do you hear me? - Yes, I hear you! - I heard! - No, no, no! - Kneel down here. - Please, please! Please. - Kneel down! - Boss Charles! Where's my money? Boss Charles, you know it isn't our fault. You owe me yet you look so dapper. You know it's not our fault. - Do you want me to reset you? - No, please, please. You owe me yet you look so dapper. Please, it's not our fault. See, you even have a design on your hair. Do you know all you're owing me is far beyond what both of them are owing me? - I know. I agree. - Do you know? What you alone owe me is more than what these two owe me! You spent two hours designing your hair every three days. See… - I haven't cut it in a while. - Where's my money? See, it's not our fault. It was Mr. Rob. You thought you knew. Rob robbed us. You saw what happened! Boss I'm talking to you. What are you… Where's your boss? - Let's continue packing. - What are you packing? - Why are you holding me? - Tafa! Tafa! - Uchenna! - Boss, leave me alone! - What's happening? - Where's your boss? Hold him! Where is your boss? - Ahn-ahn, are you Mr. President? - I'm talking and you're still packing. I did not… You'll kill me! Oh! Did I not tell you? By the greatness of God, did I not? - Are you crazy? - But… Are you mad? - Lay down! - I'm lying down. I'm lying down! Hello! Hello, Robert! Robert, where's our money? Robert, where's our money? You're busy taking Oluchi round the town, huh? Ah, Robert! If we catch you! Oh God, if we... Hello? What did he say? He hung up. - He hung up? Hey! - Wow! - If I catch Robert, ehn? Robert! - I said so! Robert! Ah, no, no! Let me call him again. - Robert, your mother! - You said… - Robert! Your mother will suffer! - Call him, please! - You said he hung up? - Ah! Ah! - My baby. - You good? My baby. You're so silly. Don't tell me that thing! Please, don't say it again. Don't talk to me about being fair. In your life, don't ever talk to me about being fair. Have you ever… Why am I even shout… Have you ever hustled a day in your life? No, please tell me, have you ever had to work a day in your life? You want me to talk, right? Okay. I collected that money from Charles because I wanted to prove to you and your father, that I can take care of you. Are you happy? Take care of me? What is with all of you and taking care of me? I'm not sick. Babe. It's me. - Me. - Mmh. C'mon, get out! What happened to you? No, who are you, please? Or is it your brother? Ha! Robert. Is it your brother that, that had the courage to tell us that our money has disappeared. Hey! Our money has disappeared. And he carried my money, to buy car for Oluchi. Then Oluchi too is driving the car around. Spending up and down, like she won the lottery. That's who I should be shaking over? Or no, is it your father? Is it your father? Your father who is also going around, spreading money as if he is the biggest man in town. Spending money, so the people can forget all the millions and billions he stole when he was in office. Please, get out. - Babe. - Hmm. - That's them, not me. - Mmh. And who are you? You think you are different from them? You think you're different from them? See, you, your brother, your father, all of you are thieves. You hear me? You are all cut from the same cloth. You are all thieves. Abomination! I don't know how I was so stupid. Do you think I came to Lagos to faff around? Hey, you guys are scamming me in Lagos! I, Ikenna. I don't know why I was stupid. I don't know why I became stupid suddenly. All of you are cut from the same cloth. No difference. Thieves. Thieves! Just… It's not a problem. It's not a problem. We will know who is the man. Baby, don't go. You think I will beg you? "Please wait, baby! Baby!" Just help me tell your brother, ehn. Just help me deliver my message. That if he knows his name is Robert, he should come out to the streets without any security. If I will not slaughter him there! Do you hear me? Rubbish and nonsense. Me, Ikenna? You take me for a fool. It's none of my business. Listen, and listen attentively. - One week! What did I say? - Yes, one week. - What did I say? - One week, Boss Charles! - One what? - One week! What did I say? - One week. Do you hear me? - One week. One week. I don't care how you do it. If I don't see my money in one week and I have to come back here? I will turn you into a tuber of yam. You see your babe? I will use her to do press ups. I swear. If I don't do it that way, let me fail in life. That your babe, the one that you're spoiling… - Yes. - If I come back in a week and I don't get my money, I will use her to do press ups. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir! As for you, hands up, close your eyes. If I touch you, you'll change color. I'll stay like this for two days. Mad people! C'mon, get out. Idiot! Boss Charles, please! Uchenna, sorry! Sorry, see blood! - Uchenna, sorry! - Sorry, sorry! - Wait, you will break the table. - What did I do? - What did I do? - He's gone. - Sorry, please. - Sorry, sorry. - Lord, are you seeing me? - Sorry. What did I do? What did I do? No, it's fine. I understand. You're supporting your family. It's okay. It's okay. Come! Come! Are you mad? Sit down. See. Based on One and Two, I have heard what Robert has won on the streets. But take this message to him. Please tell him that we need to finalise. Before he dies. You understand? Just tell him we need to finalize. After you tell him, he will understand what I mean. Relax. Forget about these people. I actually want to tell you something. You are doing well. Yes. You are doing well. I am proud of you. You know why? Because now you know how to pitch your own tent. - Thanks, Boss. - It's an edge. Keep it up. You want to know why? All those boys who look down on you… When you start making money like your boss and start spraying them with it, they will forget your struggles. It's your money they will celebrate. Because Truth Number One, "Go where the money and power is." - You understand? - Yes, Boss. - So relax. Everything is good. - No problem. Tafa! - Tafa! - Yes? What do you want to eat? I'm not really hungry, but if they have… Let them bring three chickens. And zobo. Or kunu. Bring chicken and kunu. Thank you, Boss. Thank you. No worries. If I see Robert, I will pass on the message. Everything. This is the only thing we have. - Is it the last one? - Yes. - Enjoy it. - Let me pay for it. No, no. I will cover it. Save your money. Enjoy. - Enjoy it. - Should I take it? Enjoy. Hey, you! Are you… Are you… What did you do? What did you do? Are you mad? - Don't be angry, sir. - Are you mad? Are you crazy? - You have lost focus? - No. - Didn't you see me here? - I, I… See, see… Hello! - Hello! - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! Everyone should listen to me, even those that are upstairs. I give everyone here four days! Anyone owing me money, you have four days to refund my money. If you don't return my money, I will turn you into yam. Leave him! Are you…? Are you mad? - Four days! You hear what I'm saying? - I hear you, sir. - Especially you. - I've heard. - You'll stay here till tomorrow. - I hear you. - Leave him alone. - Boss, boss! - Are you crazy? Are you mad? - Boss! - Are you crazy? - Wait, wait! I should leave this bastard? Are you… Are you crazy? He is sleeping now. We could take on more private lessons. Zee, it is in four days. Four days! Ye! - You, ehn?! Back here? - Wait, wait! See, I don't… I don't… I don't do it anymore. I'm not part of them! Wait! I want to confess. - Are you mad? - Wait, wait! I was not a part of it! I swear! - Ike, wait! - Please. I want to confess. Please I want to confess. I overheard when Robert told Oluchi… He told Oluchi something. No? Alright. It's a'it. It's a'it. Close your eyes. - Close your eyes. - Okay, okay. Open it. - Is that…? - Gold. - Gold? - Yeah, baby. That, my baby, - is 60 thousand dollars... - Sixty thousand dollars! - Shh. Cool down. - Sixty thousand dollars? - Yup. That's 27 million naira. - Twenty-seven million naira. - There's lots more where that came from... - Heyo! - Yup. So don't… Aye, aye! - What is it? Twenty-seven million naira? Twenty-seven million baby. - Ah! - Yes, for sure! This guy is a bastard. When I was thinking ours was worse than his. You own isn't that bad! It's not that bad! What about me? Everyone hates me around here. Whenever I come, I get beaten. Please give me water. Ah! No, no. Please give me water! Ah! If they had told me that I, Chubi, could be part of a bad gang, I could have sworn for the person. I who like a simple life. I face only my music. I'm even working on a song now. I don't want anyone to hear it yet but let me give you a snippet. ♪ This life ♪ ♪ Is not my own ♪ ♪ The poor gets poorer ♪ ♪ The rich gets richer ♪ ♪ Where are we going from here ♪ ♪ The poor get poorer ♪ ♪ The rich gets richer ♪ ♪ We've been scammed ♪ ♪ We've been so... ♪ - Are you mad? - Are you crazy? - It looks like you've gone mad. - Tell me you're mad! I should finally just kill you, right? - You want me to kill you right? - I haven't sung my part yet. - No, no, no! - Ike, that's enough. Ike! Stop, it's okay. Let go of him! If you kill me now… There's something I want to tell you that will make things easier for you… - Ike, leave him. - Talk now! If I die, I won't be able to say it. Ike, leave him so he can talk. I swear. If someone told me, I, Chubi would be in a bad gang, I would never have believed it. Charles is who I am following, he is an ex-convict. He was close to being sentenced to death. Let me tell you. All our money. Reachvest, or what's it called? Everything has disappeared. Ah! All the money we gathered into a large bag, it's all gone. Robert took everything and he's turned it to gold. He wants to carry that gold and leave the country. - Ah! - Wait. Wait. Ah! Wait. Okay. The… Reachvest. We invest in the US Gold Treasury. - Ah. - Yes! It's what he was trying to tell us that day he was using advanced English! "You know how you have to invest in gold. Now you have 43 billion…" I fell for that mad man! He used his high English to confuse me. Ah! Ah! Please, I have received beating all day from the residents of this area. - Please just give me juice. - Huh? I am talking about the money we lost. - Ah! Robert! Robert! - Ah. Ah! "I'm gonna, gonna." Seems like you've gone mad, right? Seems like you've gone crazy, right? Do you think we are playing here? - No, I... - Shut up! You think we are playing here? In four days, Charles will come and literally kill all of us, and you are telling me rubbish. That's what I was trying to say. I just want… See, I just… Shut up! I just!… I just… I just what?! Look at this guy. See, I… It wouldn't work. Okay. Ah! It won't work. See! I have one idea. What is it? See. I have an idea but I don't know if it'll work. I've been thinking and planning, but I'm not so sure about it. Let me just say it. If it works, that's good. If it doesn't work… What if we do… - we do money heist. - Tsk, tsk. Bro, what can we sell please. Uchenna. Ahn-ahn. Ah! See, Ikenna! I know what I am saying. I have been living with this guy for several weeks. I know the in and outs. Believe me. This thing could work. Let's try it. Ahn-ahn! Okay, look. You will be Tokyo. You will be London. You, you will be… Tsk, you will be Kaduna! Tafa doesn't really know anything, but he will still follow us. He will drive the car or something. I have a plan in my head. I know the blueprints of the house, where this guy is living. I have lived with him for weeks, how won't I know… Okay, Ikenna. If you want to steal from Uchenna and Zara, isn't there a way you know you will steal it. You will know, because you have lived with them. Trust me. I know the plan. We go in and we go out. Huh? Everyone should talk because if Charles come we are in trouble. And you, just had a little baby. You want his boys to scatter this house? This is the right time. This is the right time to act. The right time is the future and the future is the leader of tomorrow. You understand me? Let's go, one night. Look, that's enough. I hear you. We'll do it. Let us go. - What do you mean by, "We'll do it"? - Calm down. - He's agreed. Looks like you don't want... - Are you mad?! - I said we will do it. - Okay, lets join our hands. - Join hands for what? - That's how they do it in Money Heist. It's like your madness is affecting you. I said lets go with the plan and you are saying we should join hands. Okay. It seems like you know the plan. Go and carry the gold yourself. Hey, hey. Okay come. Now, you are talking. Okay, join hands. - This is rubbish. - Ike, put your hand in. Good. Alright, join, join. - Add your hand, come on. - Ike, put your hand in! Yes! - Okay, wonder woman! - Aye! Leave my wife. Really? Okay. No worries. So what should we call ourselves? Chief was still doing "He is my son" The fact that the chief had stolen so much money in his lifetime, stopped him telling his son that he was in the wrong. Oluchi became a junior madame in their house. How the hell do you think you can get away with this? Charles also lost money in Reachvest. - But Charles and Robert - Leave my house! - Get out! - Stilll became close friends. Please. It doesn't make any sense. "Bad guy" isn't for the faint-hearted. Me, I am faint hearted. My heart is faint. - Robert. Robert. - Get the fuck out of here. Go and tell them that you will give them back their money! See! I will fucking slap you! I will fucking slap you! Today was the perfect day to enter that house. Because Robert told all the security to go on holiday. So now or never. - Chubi, why don't you want to help me? - See I have heard everything you want to say. Any little thing, you will ask me to introduce you to Davido. I don't even know if you can sing? I have never heard you sing. Music isn't a joke. Okay, let me force your brain. What's a falsetto? - Falsetto? - See, you don't know. That's why I… See… Music isn't for everyone. Wait, I'm coming. Chubi, you didn't listen to my demo. Should I play my demo for you? - Have you heard me sing before? - Hello? - Hello. Engage. Romeo Alpha Juliet. - See Chubi, I'm not just bragging. - Engage, engage at this moment! - If you listen to my demo, you will be begging David to - to sign me on. - You said? See, don't worry. If it's about music and you want to do music... - Don't worry, let me go and get my phone. - Oh! Don't worry about that. The way you are, I already know how your voice sounds. Are you sure I shouldn't go and get my phone. Wait, no need to get your phone, it's me that you are talking to. Just make sure that it's not love songs you want to produce. The industry is saturated with love songs. Can you sing burial songs? - Burial song? - Yes. - Who died in your house? - Nobody. Idiot, nobody will die. But, it will only you be you collecting money from shows at funerals. - Ah, Boss! - Oh! If anyone... Welcome, sir. - Welcome, sir. Welcome, sir. - Americana! Lord! Why are you still here? Is it me? - He wants to help me with my music career. - Uh… - I wanted to pop out some… - I was about leaving, but it's him that delayed me. I was about leaving, but it's him that delayed me. My Afrobeat career. - That's all. - Alright. - I wanna go now. - Chubi. - Don't forget me. - Sure fam! - Tell them. You hear? - No problem, we will see later. - Tell them. - Alright, my G. Okay. Thank you. Chubi! If Chubi had any courage at all he would have stolen Robert's gold stash by himself. But his faint heart could only handle pointing out three possible locations. Yo, guys. Nothing is here. Any lucky on your side? Hello? Guys? I didn't see anything. Wasiu! Are you there? God. Ahn-ahn. Um, Robert. - Hi, Dad. - Come, Son. Uh, just… Yeah, I need to get something from my room. I'll be right back. Who is there? Talk to me. What's going on? I'm busy. Abeke. - Can you just give him a listening ear? - Mommy. Listen to him. Do that now. What is it, that you said you needed to do? Over! Over! Ol' boy! Seems like I found something. I've found it. That was surprisingly easy. We should have done this a long time ago. I am coming. - What do you think you are doing? - I… - What's up? Where's Tafa? - We have made it! - Yeh! - Shh. No need to shout. Tafa. Tafa? Tafa! Copy. - Tafa! - Don't shout. Tafa? Tafa! I will kill your father! Move out! Tafa! Tafa! Please. Tafa! Shit. - Tafa! Thunder will strike you! Over! - Don't shout! - What's wrong with you? - Sorry, sorry. - We have made it big time! - Wait. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Yeh! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! What is that? What… Robert. - Robert? - What is it? - Easy. - Move! - Wait! Ah! - Move! - Move! - Please! - Where is… I can't find… - Please. - Easy, easy. - Please. Calm down. Calm down! Aren't we in the same industry as you? It's okay. It's okay. I don't want to kill anybody today. Good. Good. Very good. But if you like, try and be like Spartacus. Then you will find out it's not rubber bullets I brought to this place. I am here for the loot. Let me have it in peace. To avoid causalities. Loot? What loot? - Which loot? - Oh, mommy! I don't understand what you people are talking about. - Where is the loot? - Please. Look there is no money in this house. No money at all. And the truth is that, we are very peaceful here. Leave my family alone. We are good... Sir! Sir! Sir, please! - I have a confession to make. - Ahn-ahn. I am not part of this family. My parents don't have money. Chief has plenty money. That's why they want me to marry his daughter. I don't have any money, sir. Please, let me go. I'll go - and I won't tell anybody! - Quiet! Samuel! - Please! Leave my son! Leave my son! - Dad! I don't wanna die! Dad! Dad. I don't want to die… Please just give him what he wants. - You will not die. Leave my son. - Dad. I don't want to die… - Please just give him what he wants. - You will not die. Leave my son. - Dad, I'm begging you. - Please leave my son. Please. Please. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello! - Hi! - Hello! - Hi! When I say "hello", you say "hi". Didn't you go to school? - Hello! - Hi! - Good. - Charles? It's not Charles. This is Charles, of course. Who else will say "hello" and force everyone to say "hi". So many people say that exact thing in the world. Charles, if it's you, we don't have any proof or anything. It's not like we saw you face. Charles, if it's you don't take off the mask. Then... Boss Charles, I swear I didn't see your face. Boss Charles, why did you do that? Please. Anybody who sees, will get hit. Anybody who sees, will get hit. - It is what it is. - Boss Charles. It is what it is. And as it is, you will all die. If you want peace, let me have my loot. Or else people... Good, good. Hold him! - Hold him! Hold him! - Bastard! Robert, hold his hand! Robert! Come and hold his hand down. Apobi! - Friend! - Drop the gun, hold the hand. Hold his hand. Beat him. You don't know how to hold the guy. See, hold the gun like this! - Let me show you! - Shut…! The fuck up! - Ah Son? What is... - All of you! - All that is not necessary. - Why are you shooting at my roof? Do you know how much... Will you shut the fuck up! Shut... Robert! What's wrong with you, my son? - What is it? - Everyone shut the fuck up! What's going on…? What is this? This was supposed to be, a simple fucking robbery. A simple job. Break in. Take the loot. Leave. That's it. I don't know what the fuck these fools are doing here. What are you doing here? I had a very simple plan. - Did you call me your son? - Mmh! I heard you say "son." Did you call me your son? I am your biological fa... Ask me... Aye! Shut up! Shut up! Shut... Aye! If anyone moves, I swear to God I will fucking kill every single one of you. - I'm going to ask you something. Okay? - Yes. Yes, I am ready to answer. When was the last time you were a father to me? Ask yourself. When have you ever been a father to me? I… I… You left us with nothing. You know that, right? You know that, right? When I talk to you, you answer. Okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. She was pregnant when you left. Who does that? No, who does that! Do you know what it's like for a single mother without papers and no money living over there? Do you know what it's like? Do anyone of you know what it is like - to be in foster care over there? - Ha! - Do any of you know? - My brother in the Lord. Violence is not the way out. We can sort this out amicably. - Ha! Ha! - We are all Nigerians... Do you know? I am asking you a fucking question! King! For goodness' sakes… You the thing that gets to me the most is that she actually thought the world of you. She used to tell me every single day. Every single day. "Your father is a good man" "Your father is a good man." That's all she used to say. - Are you a good man? - Huh? Are you a good man? Ask yourself how she died. Do you even know? My mom killed herself because of you. Aye! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Look I'm not fucking with any of you guys, okay? How many times did I hear, "Your father will come back, when he makes enough money." Right? That's what you told her, right? How do you think I felt when I came here, and see you eating money for fucking breakfast! Huh?! Huh? I come here, I see you living the life. But it's okay. I understand it now. It all makes sense. Money is everything, right? Right? Money is everything. Because it has to be the most important thing. It surely has to be, if it can keep a father from his own fucking biological son. It has to be the most important thing. I said no problem. That's fine. That's fine. I will make enough money. For everyone. Okay my family will never suffer. I will never be poor. Even if I have to steal and kill every single one of you, my family will never suffer. Please, we're begging you. I came over here thinking, maybe it's like a good thing. You know. Maybe if I did enough, I could connect with my family. But it's okay. I made my mistakes, I'll be the first one to say I'm not perfect. Okay. Yes. I did a couple of things wrong. Yes, I went to jail. Yes I have been arrested. Yes I am wanted for fraud. That's okay. That's life. I'm still a good guy. - The Lord... - In the US? Are you… Do you guys actually believe, I just got here from the States? No, honestly. Do I sound like somebody who just came from the States! Even the bible made it clear that those that, "Those that stood by... " What the fuck is wrong with you guys? You know what, why am I still putting on this accent? [In Nigerian accent] Eh see, I will kill all of you guys. - No! - Aye! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I will fucking kill all of you. Don't fucking try me. Look. I left the States when I was sixteen. Okay? I had to leave. Yeah. I'm wanted all over the world. It's fine. Don't worry. It's not even a problem. But I come here and I see you living a fucking life with your fucking queen. This stupid, pompous bitch! - And you! - Please don't kill me. Get the fuck over here! Get the fuck over here! Hey! Hey! Get over here! Ah! Robert, please. She's your sister! - She's your sister! - She's my what! She's my what?! Did me and my mother, not deserve all of this? Did we not?! Listen. I don't have time to play with you guys anymore. Okay. If anyone moves, you kill them. - I'm going to ask you once. Where is it? - Hmm? - Where is it! - Where is what? I'm gonna ask you one last time. - Or I will kill every... - Come on, bring this… Stop! Drop it! Wait. Wait. Stop it. Stop it. - Fucking drop it. - Tafa give it to them. - It's in the walls. - Drop it. - Ha! - Everybody go down! - Hey! - It's in the walls. - Daddy! - See money! Daddy! Everybody down. Get down! In the walls. - There's the money. - See! This idiot hide the money in the walls. Keep your eye on them. Okay? If you guys want, I'll kill you. Ha! God! God! This man, see where you are hiding our money. Something two million people could share. All these politicians, it's only hell fire you will know. - Daddy! - Eh? Ha! Even the Devil is shocked. Look at where you are keeping money. Ha! All of us will eat! - Ha! - I told you. You are just as much as a criminal as I am. You are looking at me like I am the bad guy. Huh? Look at all this money. Look at all this fucking money. I said I fucking knew it. Knew it. Jesus. Thieving son of a bitch. Please! Like father, like son. Bobby, it's getting late. Let's go. My friend! Will you go and get the car! Stupid fool! Bobby! Where is this guy? Everyone stay still. Stay where you are, you are all evidence now. Hey! ♪ The Lord is good! ♪ ♪ He has done me well!

Rumor has it that he still has quite a lot hidden underground. Look! An issue for another day please. Oluchi! I beg you call the Ghanaian Embassy and tell them I'll turn myself in.
