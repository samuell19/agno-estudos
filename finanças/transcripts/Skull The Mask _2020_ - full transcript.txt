"HEAR THE DIRT IN THE WORLD SUMMONING ANHANGÁ. THIS MOVES THE EARTH BOWELS. THEY DEMAND AND SAY THAT THEY ARE SACRED. THEY WILL BE BIG WHEN YOU ARE BIG. AND YOU PUT THE CHIEFS ON EARTH". Huillca Prayer - Uumu to Tahawantinsupay FILM ARCHIVE PROLOGUE God, my beloved father. Search my heart. You know my nature. And all my weakness. Compared to you, I'm so small, but I got stronger in your presence. [Tupi-M'Bai] Listen. Tahawantynsupay. Earth dirt. This makes the Earth intestines ccontinue. [Tui-M'Bai] They demand and say they are holy. They will be great when you are. [Tupi-M'Bai] Always with dry dew. In the air. You say. [Tupi-M'Bai] Made of the world's vanity. And you put the chiefs on Earth. The strangest is that the rocks we found are not in their natural state. - Really? - Really. They seem carved in large rocks. We are on an archaeological site. Is this where you kept the artifacts? Here's what the guys found on the site. It's a skull mask. The workers found it. Some recognized as Anhangá, others as T'Uxlu. I don't know. Hm... It is indeed a strange artifact. Do you think the bosses will like it? I think so. But this could benefit the institutional image of the company... if it is really an archaeological artifact. How were the workers calling this? Anhangá. Anhangá. A-NHAN-GÁ. So do you want to take it? Yes, of course. Are you afraid of something? No... Have a good day of work. Afraid of what? The investigations on the disappearance of three Bolivian children in São Paulo continues. An investigation started and police Officer Beatriz Obdias is to be in charge of the case. The policewoman is talking to witnesses in order to explore clues. Officer Obdias was indicted in slaughter crimes on 2005, but she was absolved, making a deal at her trial. In other news, the government constructions at Anhangabaú Valley continues. Its completion, originally planned for 2015, was extended... Hey, Ramirez! The work is done! I can't Pablo, I gotta finish this. Good night, Manco. Or is it morning already? I brought an envelope with your new papers. You didn't have to... I could have picked them at the church. I didn't want to disturb your work. There are some things in the envelope that belonged to your father. It was hard to find anything from before the 1950s, specially in that area of the amazon. But I've tried. The church could return the rest of my father belongings... - Don't you think? - What do I think? Where would you store them? 500 years of history in your rental shack? Would you store your father's weapons, and the militia weapons as well? Would you start guerrilla in the city, Manco? Is that it? I imagined it. It was nice seeing you, Manco Ramirez. May God be with you. See you later, father. Did he use to come here? The father of one of the children used to come here during the day hours. Did he owe money to the videopoker owners? What are you saying? We don't have gambling here! I'm not here because of this, ma'am. I wanna know who's involved with the child's father. Here he comes. Ask him. Is this the policewoman looking for my daughter? - No, fuck! - She's my daughter, fucking shit! She's my daughter! She's my daughter! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! POLICE OFFICER INVESTIGATING MISSING CHILDREN WAS INVOLVED IN 2005 SLAUGHTER Hello, Galvani. Mr. Tack, I'm already in São Paulo. This time the trip was a success, and I have secured the item's transportation. Is it potentially genuine? We can only confirm after some tests. But, as you suggested, they identified the item by a local term: T'Uxlu. I want to see my mother. We're going to analyze the piece. Keep it safe by your side and bring it tomorrow as early as possible. You can leave my luggage here. Thank you very much. Good night, Joaquim. Good night. - Oh my God! You scared me! - Hey, gorgeous. I missed you a lot, baby. Tell me, did you have a nice trip? So... I think it was great! Now we have a new item for the museum. Come here. - Good morning. - Good morning. What was that all about, this night at the bar? What? You said that you'd shot the guy because he disrespected you. I was joking. Beatriz... Try not to stay late. Bye, Carlão. Ah, curious Lilah... Let me see it. Unfortunately, no. You can only see the item when it is on the museum, it is super important. At least tell me what it is. I think it is a genuine pre-Columbian artifact. It's a mask. Ah, let me see it! No, I just said no! I'm exhausted, I've been travelling for two whole days. I need to sleep. - Let's go to bed. - I'll go soon. - Aren't you coming? - I'm going. Soon. Okay. I'll wait you there. - Let me take this. - See you soon. [Tupi-M'Bai] Listen. Tahawantynsupay. Earth dirt. [Tupi-M'Bai] This makes the Earth intestines continue. [Tupi-M'Bai] They demand and say they are holy. [Tupi-M'Bai] They will be great when you are. Always with dry dew. In the air. [Tupi-M'Bai] You say. Made of the world's vanity. And you put the chiefs on Earth. [Tupi-M'Bai] Listen. Tahawantynsupay. Earth dirt. [Tupi-M'Bai] This makes the Earth intestines continue. [Tupi-M'Bai] They demand and say they are holy. [Tupi-M'Bai] They will be great when you are. Oh, my god! The neighbors said they heard screams early in the morning. What are you doing here, Beatriz? This is a robbery case. Commissioner Bruna Thristão asked me to examine the crime scene. - Oswaldo, can we talk over there? - Excuse me. So you're the one who called the police? Yes, it was me. Where were you last night? At my mother's house. I welcomed Mrs. Galvani and went away. Oswaldo talked to his mother. The alibi is real. We didn't find anything that fits in that box. Therefore, robbery. Can you please leave my crime scene? Can I take a look at the expert's report? The heart is missing... And most of the viscera as well. Oh, my God... Who are you? Do you know the victims? My name is Tack Waelder. What happened here? There was a murder here. She came back yesterday and when she didn't show up at the office, I became suspicious. Suspicious of what? Do you know if the victims had a quarrel with anyone? Quarrel? No, I don't know about that... I was afraid that she would run away with the artifact. What is this artifact you're talking about? Galvani travelled to the Amazon specially to retrieve an artifact. What artifact would that be? An item of an incalculable archeological value. Please come with me. Do you recognize this box? No, no, no! Where is my artifact? Who let this guy in here? Police! Back off, back off! May we talk outside, Mr. Tack, please? What's your name, investigator? It's detective. And my name is Beatriz. Look, they are dead now. I think you should put an effort on what really matters. Let me know if there's any clue on the item's whereabouts. As I told you, it is of an immeasurable archeological value. Have a good day. The same. This guy is an asshole! I can't believe I trusted that incompetent. I'll go straight to the office. OK. I need you to go to the warehouse. With this delay, we need to make sure our living cargo can stand until we find the mask. A barbaric crime happened this night. Two women, 40 and 21 years old, brutally killed at their home, in the West of São Paulo. The victims are Galvani Volta and Lilah Domingues. The couple's home was broken in and the bodies were found without signs of struggle or resistance against the aggressor. However, the place appeared to be the site of a black magic ritual. The specialists were intrigued by the lack of the heart inside the chest of both victims. It seems like the victims were cut open, but there was a very small amount of blood at the place. The police said the events are under investigation and it is considered to be a robbery followed by murder. - Good morning. - Good morning. What a fucking mess. - Is everything in order? - Yes. How can there be so much blood here? The corpse was dry as hell. I don't know, man. They took the heart right out, blood everywhere. It's all messed up. Cold blooded killer. Speaking of blood... Did you see the massacre yesterday? I'm Corinthians, man! Stop it! Go Corinthians! I told you Palmeiras was going to win. It doesn't even have a World title. I may have lost two grand, but we have a World title. You son of a bitch! You fuck! Please come in, Mr. Tack will see you now. Thank you for coming after your work hours. Please, sit. I'm fine. What do you want to talk about? Detective Beatriz, Galvani was one of the most beloved employees here at the company. She will be deeply missed. But, detective, I need you to know that it is very important to recover the stolen artifact. Don't worry, this is part of the investigation. I know you're in charge of the investigation about the Bolivian children. But I need you to change your focus to what is more important at the moment. We'll do what we can. I know you had your share with unsolved crimes. It's ironic to think about your priorities at the moment. So, let's be reasonable. I'm not accusing you of anything. But I have influence in the police, and I can help you. I'm going to find your artifact, don't worry. In there you will find a lot of information about the item. And on a suspect from São Paulo that we think it's interested on getting something that rare. I know the police doesn't have the resources to work. If you want help from private initiative, I'll be happy to provide the adequate resources. Carlos, I need the hard drive of the computer found at the robbery site. The one with the black magic ritual. No, no... There's no need. Just make a goddamn copy! - Hottie. - I love you. I love you too. Manco... Father... Tahawantynsupay brought Anhangá to our world. Again with this, Manco. I saw the news on TV. But it's a coincidence. A terrible, tragic and violent coincidence. It's not the works of a demon that the indians invented to frighten the jesuits. What about the hand? Listen, Manco. The order was created because they didn't agree with the ways of the jesuits. To study the native people here, their mythology, their legends. And, for a long time, the order believed and prepared to fight these demons. I believed. You can simply see at all the things stored here waiting for this apocalypse to come. But, Manco, it does not exist. You worked here, you know that. Father... What about the hand? What about the crying saint? And the flying father? A theater doesn't mean the apocalypse arrived. And holy water does not kill vampires. You should learn that. The femur of Tahawantynsupay is rightfully mine. My father was responsible for it. Was! Without it I can't defeat Anhangá. The mask will keep killing and offering sacrifices to Tahawantynsupay. If the mask was actually brought to São Paulo, it is an inestimable relic, of immeasurable value. It has to be displayed, but that's it. Manco, a mask doesn't kill people! The hearts were ripped out. But what if it's a maniac believing he will gain divine powers, just like 70 years ago? It's a mask, not the devil. I would like it to be, I trained a lot for this, but it is not. I need the femur of Tahawantynsupay to lure the mask. The femur is not here. It is no longer your responsibility. Look, if the bone is here, Anhangá will come. He will come in a straight line! Don't worry, Manco, the Earth is safe. The world changed a lot in the last... 500 years. The Camaken will be extinguished. And the world... Will go back being chaotic and dark. What about your rotten hand? You can keep it. You're going to need it. JESUITS HIDE REPORT ON THE POWER OF INCA MAGIC I'll meet you at the station. I just came to the robbery site to check on something. No, it won't take long, I'm just trying to find something. I think it's witness elimination. Carlos, witness elimination? They ripped out the heart and guts. It's the same procedure, Carlos. The guts were ripped out. But the targets don't match. We were at a manor, now we're in a shack in the slums. Carlos, why didn't he leave through where he entered and left through the other door? It's hard to find an explanation for this. What's wrong? Nothing. I just think this is all very strange. What are you doing here? Detective, I would like you to make a little extra effort to find our artifact. Mr. Tack Waelder believes in your services, specially due to your rich resumé. On the other hand... I'll confess that I am a little disappointed by the results so far. Get out of here! In the envelope you will find two things. First, a proposition to your future. Second, a reason to accept the proposition and speed up your obligations. Thank you for the coffee. You can't quit now, rookie. The Chinese are paying a lot of money so that we settle this problem for them. I know. Consider this a initiation ritual so you can become a proper adult. This will grow hair in your chest. Besides, these children are all guilty anyway. We're just forwarding for their future. Today you will become a true pro. Hey, the entrance to the costume party is on the other side. Get out! Hey, where are you? This party is crazy! Keep on doing your job. Don't let them touch anything. - Good morning, Commissioner. - Excuse me, Commissioner. Good morning, Beatriz. I thought you would like to take a look at this scene. Most of the attendees managed to escape. Fortunately the emergency exits were unlocked. Even so, we counted 9 bodies. It's the same killing pattern as the others. But there's no pattern on the victims. Hey! Beatriz! What was that? Our suspect ran away. What was that? Commissioner, I need authorization to perform a special operation. Based on what? That was our main suspect getting away. I need a search warrant for his residence. I need much more than your certainty. What is this? This is a complete dossier on Manco Ramirez. He is the main suspect on the murders and the robbery of the museum artifact. What does a guerrilla man have to do with this? Beatriz, where did you get this? This was given to me by Tack Waelder, indicating the suspect of the robbery of the mask. Mask? What mask? Pretty convenient. The guy shows up with a file and says who's the guilty one. You are a little bit experienced in life to believe in such a story. I don't have the means to do this officially. I'll accept your offer. Thank you, Beatriz. You'll see that with our team things are more efficient. We need to legitimize our actions and this is a good beginning. Sir, if I may say so, I think we could act on our own without the interference of this officer. Excavations in protected areas, purchase of archeological items. We need a cultural institute, a museum. We're managing a company, not a war! OK, sir. I'll set up this operation. I'll find Manco and I'll find the mask. Who stole this mask doesn't know what's doing. It is being wasted on a random killing spree. But Manco knows how to find it. What about the children? They remain confined, waiting for the ritual. Now it's up to you to do your job. Find the mask before the children languish. I'll find the mask, sir. Don't worry. Kneel, demon, before the wrath of God! Hell will fall under the Lord's arm. God's hand is sharp. That's where is the Father's church. I knew the asshole was lying. Son of a bitch, get down! Sir! Damn you Father, you didn't believe in Tahawantynsupay. But Tahawantynsupay indeed exists! Anhangá! Anhangá! Where were you this morning? I called you about 15 times. I was moonlighting. Making some money. It was my day off, OK? I can do whatever I want on my day off. While you were making some money, we received a phonecall... from a church close to the nightclub where the killings took place. I think we could check this, what do you think? Stop! Stop! Stop! Police! Police priority. I need support. I can't let you keep this mask. It is my duty to protect it. [Chinese] JIÚ SHIJIÚ: building a better world Ladies and gentlemen. It's an honor to be here. First of all, I would like to thank the police. Specially the detective Beatriz Obdias. To her restless services provided in order to punish criminals like that. Crimes committed against our society and our culture! Preventing that magnificent items like this one stay out of the sight of the public! Thank you. Thank you very much. The Jiú Shíjie Industries, through its cultural institute, aims at preserving the memory of old and new immigrants that arrive everyday at our beloved city of São Paulo. Thank you very much. Have fun and enjoy our exhibition. Good night. Mrs. Beatriz. We need to talk. Can we go to my office? Hello. Just a minute. Yes, you can prepare the children, I'm on my way. I would like to thank you for your provided services. What is this on the table? Calm down, investigator. What is this? Don't you know what we are planning to do? I didn't get it, Tack. You're fooling those people, the mask is still here. Beatriz. Replicas are standard security. And you know that a museum can catch fire. It is dangerous. Dangerous is to leave important things like this in the hands of the indians. In here it will be secure and will be put to use. At least inside a glass in a museum nobody would be stupid enough to try anything. I know exactly how to proceed. One more thing... There are more masks like these around. Other people will die, Tack! Yes, maybe. But it is important that this power remains with human beings that build up to an ideal society. Like you, Beatriz. We are very happy to offer you a job here. It's not possible that you're saying this. No remorse from me, really. Did you read my proposition? I don't think so. That's ok. We are not going to repeat past errors. Now the mask lies in responsible hands. We're going to act properly. We are going to search for the other pieces. And with your help, we're always going to have child's blood available. It's nothing different from what you've done before. You only have to provide the same service you did in the past. Nothing new. Are you going to accept our proposition or not? Police! Police! It's under control. Please step outside. Please step outside. Everything is fine. Please leave the premises. Get out. Let's go.
