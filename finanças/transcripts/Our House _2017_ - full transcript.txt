TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS GRADUATE SCHOOL OF FILM AND NEW MEDIA FILM DEPARTMENT GRADUATION WORK FOR THE 11TH CLASS What's wrong? Did you hear something just now? Hear what? The sound of the door opening. It's your imagination. I thought someone came back. What costume should I take? It's hard to find a navy blue skirt. You don't have to match? Our House Seri, are you awake? Seri! I'm coming... Ugh... No bread for breakfast? Rice is more filling. But I don't get hungry at school. Make sure to lock the house. Are you listening? I'm leaving. Right on time. You're not right on time. You're always making me wait. I'm sorry. Seri always wakes up late. Yeah, sure. Let's go. It's cold... My drink is cold too. I should have brought my scarf. Winter is coming. I definitely like summer better. Me too. I like summer evenings with fireworks in the distance. I turn off the lights early and sleep. When I listen carefully to the fireworks, I feel like my family has disappeared. The earth is like a drum being hit. It must be so lively over there. It makes me feel like I'd never go to such a dumb festival. I'm scared of fireworks. It feels like bombs are being dropped by a foreign country. 1, 2, 0, 9? Hey, don't look! It's somebody's birthday, isn't it? You have a boyfriend? It's just a motorcycle license plate number. Whose? Your father's? I'm not telling you. What do you mean? Kotoe... You went to see the fireworks this year. You wore a yukata, and you were with a guy. No, I was in a group of three. What? You're late. Where were you? You're late too, Mom. No, this is my usual time. Cigarettes It's hot! By the way... What about your birthday party? What do you want to eat this year? Hmm... I've invited your aunt and uncle. How many friends are coming? Five... No... Six. Wait... Three. Why haven't you invited them yet? Three. It'll be three people. Kotoe and... Who else? Eat the pickles, too. I don't want to eat anything so pink. It's delicious. It's grandma's favorite. The grandma from the cigarette shop? That's right. I'm tired. I'm tired of hearing you complain about work. I don't complain that much. If work is that boring, I don't want a job when I grow up. It's just like that. I have a lot of fun things. Tell me. I don't want to tell you. What? This song... Isn't it wonderful? I went to the secret beach with Kotoe after school. We've been going there since elementary school. It hasn't changed at all. Maybe no one will be at home when I wake up tomorrow morning. I wish that would happen. But I wouldn't want that to happen. I counted the specks of dust on the ceiling. There were 14... It's almost my birthday. Have we always had that vase? Takashi gave it to me. It's a weird shape. He said it's plump, just like you, Seri. This is Koyama speaking. Okay. That's fine. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow at 3:00. We have to hurry or we'll be in trouble. I'll go check it out. Yes... It's clear. Yes... Excuse me. Are you okay? You look dizzy. You were on the boat earlier, right? Yes... Why don't you sit down? When I woke up just now... I couldn't remember anything. Why am I here? Do we know each other? Do we know each other from way back? We met for the first time today. Is this your house? That's right. Do you live alone? Come over here. You have a lot of bags. Can I open them? They're your bags. It's a present... Is it for me? Or did I get it for someone else? Do you want to open it? I'll open it tomorrow. Where did you come from? I don't know... All my memories were gone when I woke up. So I don't remember anything. What is your name? Sana. So you know your name. It seems like it... I wonder why... Am I... Sana...? Yes, you must be Sana. I'm Toko. Toko? Get some sleep. You might get your memory back tomorrow. Stop it... Isn't that too blue? Do I look too obvious? Let me do your eyeliner then. Eyelashes, first. Oh, right... Hey, what do you think about this? The one you're wearing looks older. - This one?- Yes. What about this? It's cute... But I like the shorter one. - This one?- Yes. What about this? This one. Should I put this on? Is this lipstick too dark? I think it's just right. She's dressed up today. You think so? Oh! Let me see. Oh! They're so bold... I'm home. What is it? What happened, Seri? You scared me. I thought you were a ghost. I saw a ghost earlier. What? I can't go upstairs, because I'm too scared. There's no such things as ghosts. There was a ghost. Seri... Do you want to sleep in my bed tonight? I'm taking a bath. Did you sleep well? Yes. It's warm... I wonder if someone is looking for me. This newspaper is from three days ago. I just found it Then I won't be in there. Did you remember anything? What should I do? Just relax. But I have to leave after I finish eating. Where are you going? If you're going to leave, take this... I'm going to work. I filed a missing person report today. The police won't do anything for you. But I have nothing else to do. You don't have to do anything now. Are you always alone? Usually. My friends come over occasionally. But that rarely happens. Why did you help me, Toko? Because you looked like you needed help. Hold on... I need your help with this. What is this? It's frayed. I'm fixing children's clothes. You're really good. I guess so... I do this all the time, but I never get better. Blowing a whistle. The sky is clear and blue, shining on the pasture. Let's sing, cheerfully, holding hands. The duck goes quack quack! The goat goes baah. Let's sing and march together. Today is a delightful day. See.. There are some things you remember. Things that are embedded in your mind will never be lost. I don't think that I've ever had this much fun. Even though you can't remember your past? Yeah, I think so. You can stay as long as you want. You're not opening it? I'll open it tomorrow. I feel like I shouldn't open it. Happy Birthday Happy birthday to you Happy Birthday Happy birthday dear Seri Happy Birthday Happy birthday to you Happy Birthday Keep blowing. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Thank you! Happy birthday! You're 14 now... Seri, you've grown so much. Seri, happy birthday! I hope you like it. Thank you! Let's eat. Looks delicious. Is there a knife? We have to cut it evenly. The middle piece is for Seri. Did you hear the pillar crack? So, the pillars in your house are getting cracks. This house is alive. This house is still healthy. Even though he left quite a while ago. That year you left the Christmas tree out, even after the holidays were over. Because Seri insisted on keeping the tree out until her father came home. Lately we don't even put out the tree. Well, she's already in middle school. She was only this tall when I last saw her. Here you go. Thank you. Are you okay? Oh no... You're going to stain your clothes. Does Uwamachi have a 5th district? Oh, I meant to write 4th district. Looks like you've worked at restaurants. Do you know what the dining area and kitchen are? Do you really have these certifications? Do they even exist? Um... I've been interviewing you and you seem suspicious. Aren't these lies, too? You don't have to lie. Just tell me the truth. I won't get mad. All of it... is true. Okay... It's all true then. Okay, that will be all. I'll contact you if I want you back. Hello. It's been awhile. Uh... Hello. I've been watching you all this time. I can't believe that I ran into you. Excuse me? Ah... Oh... Oh, I thought you were someone else. Oh, I was wrong. I'm very sorry. It's okay... You look surprisingly similar to an old friend of mine. I see... Um... My name is Natsuki. My name is Sana. What kind of a person was she? You think the universe is pitch black, right? In fact, you can't see the light because the dust particles are so small. Just a tiny bit of the universe is visible. In reality it's filled with light that can't be seen. She was that kind of person. Light that can't be seen? But, suddenly I stopped seeing her around. Sorry, I keep talking about myself. Do you live around here, Sana? Ah... Yes... By yourself? No... I'll have another coffee. The same for her. Yes. Recently... I started living with my cousin. That sounds fun. I still don't know anything about this town. I'll show you the fun places. I'm home. Welcome home. How did it go? It was a very nice cafe. It was very quiet. Didn't you go for an interview? They said they'll call if I'm hired. Oh, okay... Oh! I went grocery shopping. I'll cook tonight. I'll have my usual meal. You go ahead and eat, Sana. But you should eat more. It's okay that you eat, Sana. But you're always eating the same thing. I don't need anything fancy. I'm happy. Oh, you can't drink that water. Drink this water. We always drink this water, remember? Why? This water is chilled and tastes better. Look. Is that a whale? Wow. Was this hole always here? You're right... That's a big hole. You stuck your finger, didn't you? It wasn't me. You did it in your sleep. I didn't do it. Seri! Help me hang the laundry. I don't want to. What? There's a strange cloud out. Come take a look. Be careful. The wind is really strong. The waves must be so high at the beach I've forgotten all about the waves. I only remember the quiet beach. You have to shake the shirts before you hang them. Otherwise, they'll be wrinkled. Dad's white glasses. I still remember. I was the better swimmer. In the summer, you used to go swimming every day. You were a quick learner. You wore the polka-dot bathing suit. You splashed to stay float. You were so cute. Did you know that most elements have dissolved into the ocean? We all came from the ocean. Yes... We already know where you are. You understand what that means? You're not the only one whose secret is known. Toko, we aren't just turning the pages of a calendar. There is no doubt. That is reliable data. Our water source is different. So the measurements are different. It's polluted, after all. Also, this... Leave it to me. I've already delivered the used clothes. Be careful. What are you doing? I knew I'd find this in dad's storage. I told you not to go in there. You brought out another thing covered with dust. What is that? Is it Christmas already? Isn't it early? Where are the decorations? The lights don't turn on. Are they broken? We don't have any decorations. I threw them away last year. Why? They were old and faded. The gold glitter kept coming off. I told you, Seri. You never told me. I liked them. I thought I might find you here. Hello. I'm glad to see you again. You like this place, don't you? I'm always dropping by between work. I wish I could have worked here. Then I'd come here way too often. Would you like to go for a walk? Toko... Are you asleep? I'm dreaming right now. I thought you'd be awake. This might be a dream. I can't fall asleep. Maybe because it's a full moon. Toko... Do you have another job, in addition to the factory? Why? Because you're gone a lot lately. Don't ask me about it. Can you tell me one day? Hmm... Who am I? Sana. Am I really Sana? I am not so sure. Nobody can prove who they are. Why do you live like this, Toko? So I won't be defeated by gravity. Otherwise, I'll get washed down to the lower side. Just like a river. Are there any humans who can overcome gravity? Oh, by the way. I might have found a treasure trove. Do you want to see? It's over here. This is nice. But it's broken. We can use it if we fix this part. What about this? Okay. There's this as well. It's fun at night because no one else is around. Yeah. Night... Night... When I think night, I think long phone calls. What? Who did you have a long phone call with, Toko? It's a word-association game. Now you try, Sana. What? Long phone calls? "Long phone calls" makes me think, "blink of an eye." "Blink of an eye" makes me think "December." "December" makes me think "Christmas." "Christmas" makes me think "fun." What? "Fun" makes me think “our living.” Our living? I'm having more fun than “Christmas” now. Me too. “Our living” makes me think “living room.” “Living room" makes me think... "Family." Family? “Family" makes me think... What are you talking about? I'm thinking about marrying Takashi. What about Dad? Takashi's house is so small... I see... What do you mean, "I see..."? Mom, let's play rock-scissors-paper. What? The winner gets to live in this house. What are you talking about? It's our... Rock, scissors, paper! I won... You lost, Seri. What shall we do? Are you moving out? Don't say such stupid things. Come on, let's eat. Seri, you like omelette rice. Toko? What's wrong? I'm home. What happened? I'm fine. You're going to catch a cold. Do you feel better? Toko... What? I know you have your reasons. But... You don't need to worry, Sana. I don't even know about myself. If I don't even know about you, Toko... Wait... Good evening. Good evening. What brings you here so late at night? Who is it? Hello. It's too late for you to come. Excuse me for coming so late at night. It is really late... Please leave. Toko... This is Natsuki. He lives nearby, and I met him by chance. I'm sorry. I don't want to cause any trouble, so I'll be going. I seem to have ruined the mood. By chance? I didn't hear about this. By chance, at a cafe. It's not in this house anymore. If you want, go ahead and search the entire house. That's your motive, isn't it? What's wrong, Toko? I... To tell you the truth... I saw you two when I was taking a walk the other night. And... I thought, so this is where you live. I'm sorry. That was by chance, too. I also wanted to talk to your cousin, Toko. Wow, this is a really nice house. I see... This leads to the upstairs. Actually, you're wrong, Natsuki. I am sorry for lying to you. A lie? So, it's a lie... Natsuki is not a bad person. You are making a mistake. Then what? Who is this? Who are you? I am... Sana... Were you lying to me? I didn't lie. It's not a lie. You have a lot of secrets too, Toko. They're things you don't need to know. It's not the same as a lie. Why were you a mess when you came home today? There was a strange phone call the other day. You're doing something dangerous. I'm doing the right thing. Sewing those used clothes... Wait... I can't see. Where are you? Here. Where? I can't see you. You're here, Toko. Where are you, Sana? Where is Natsuki? Oh... Is somebody there? Is that you, Dad? No, it's not. Who are you? Is it a blackout? I'll go check the breaker. Don't move. I'm not moving. Toko... Sana... It smells good. Seri! Are you home? I'm sorry about the vase. It's okay. Toko... Toko... Toko! What? What happened to the present that was here? I don't know. It was here... It must be somewhere. Did I get this one? You probably forgot to open it. Wasn't this from your aunt? She gave me a pink mouse. Then I wonder what it is. Why don't you open it?
