You think this is hard? Life is hard. Up! I... I can't... I will not tolerate you quittin' on me! - I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. - EUGENE: All right? You just got yourself an extra half hour of calisthenics after the other boys go in. Look at me! I got 30 years on ya! He ain't you, Benedict. I know that's what you want, but he ain't you. And you just got yourself another hour. Make it two, and you got a deal. Welcome home. (CHUCKLES) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - Bradley. - BRADLEY: Huh? Who is that? Who? Sara. ALAN: What's she doin' back here? It's summer. She's back from college. That's not Sara. It's too big to be Sara. - She has... - Tits. The place looks great. Doesn't it? All right, Mr. Tucker. That's enough. Uh... Wait a minute. Take these bags into the house, please. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (BUMPS) Excuse me. I have some fragile things in there. Mr. Tucker, please, be careful. Who's that? Oh, he's the new boy. A handful. Look at you, honey. - You light up this whole house. - (PHONE RINGS) I gotta get that. Mr. Tucker, take the bags upstairs. Hello? This is Eugene. Yeah, well...

(CHUCKLING) You're not from around here, are you, boy? You need a ride to the bus stop? No, thank you, sheriff. Just here for a job, that's all. Music teacher, Benedict's place. Mr. Benedict's expecting you? Yes, sir, he is. You enjoy makin' me look like a fool? You do a pretty good job of that yourself. WOMAN: Let's go, Hank. MAN: Fine, come on. Y'all come back now. I was hoping you'd come out. I keep telling him we're old news, but he never was one to keep up on current events. Look, I run a club on the other side of the tracks, so to speak. How's the booze? Terrible. (LAUGHING) Stop in sometime. Ask for Molly. Hey, Molly. How come that record was on the juke? I slipped it in when nobody was looking. I'll see you around, Molly. Definitely see you around. - Thank you, Doris. - You're welcome. You're more than qualified for this job, Mr. Cabe. You're gonna find these kids are damaged goods. Some of 'em are orphaned. Others are sent here by their parents, by the juvenile authorities. It's a great pity. A strong hand is what they need. Discipline. (BOYS GRUNTING) They need role models, Mr. Cabe. (COW LOWING) (CHUCKLING) CABE: Mr. Benedict, you don't have to worry about me. You need somebody to get the boys ready for the Fourth of July concert. Am I right? I'm your guy. I saw your sign when I walked through the gate, and I agree with it. I'll work hard with these boys, and I'll teach 'em their music.

No. No? No. You play chords with your left hand, and you pick with your right. - Pick with the right, huh? - Pick with the right. Kind of like this? (SNICKERS) That's just the right look for you.

Only a select few know about this right now. But I'll tell you something. In the not-too-distant future, it is gonna burn through this country like a prairie fire. You think you can handle it? You got the guts? Dang straight, man. Well, you can't. Not yet. You gotta get better. - (ALL GRUMBLING) - Okay? Now, this is the deal.

No. She's beautiful, isn't she? She's the most beautiful girl I ever saw. Only girl you ever saw. BOY: Shut up or I'll kick your little butt. BIG BOY: Try it, blimpo. I'm gonna nail her.

(LAUGHING) (SNICKERING) Hey, Sara. How you doin'? Did you have a good ride? Nice legs. On you too, Sara. SARA: Look, I've had just about enough. Oops. Mmm! (KISSING SOUNDS) JESSE: Shut up. - Shut up! - You're a regular Cary Grant there, Jess. TOBY: Smooth move, ex-lax. Hi. You're not supposed to be in here. Nah, it's okay. I... I get invited in here quite a bit. My father will be back. Do you want me to go? Do what you want. - Okay, I'll go. - No, don't. Uh... Listen, Sara, I'm really sorry that I threw dirt on your feet. You know, you're the first pretty girl that we've had around, and I guess I got a little flustered. What are you doin'? I'm just writing a letter for my father. Hey, is this a picture of you? - Yes. - Really? Yeah. I got a little picture too, actually. SARA: Are these your parents? Yeah. Handsome couple. Where are they now? Uh, they died. Oh. Yeah, in a car crash. I'm sorry. Nah, it's okay. You know, it was a long time ago. My mom died when I was eight. I remember that she had this one freckle on the end of her nose, and she would call it her kiss button. Whenever I would touch it, she would give me a kiss. Hey. What's the matter? Nothing. I just hadn't thought about her for a while. Look, I should go. Why? Um... I'll see you later. (DOOR CLOSING) (BAND PLAYING) Try it without the sheet music. I can't play it without the music. (BANGS KEYS) (MUSIC STOPS) I wanna see you after class. Okay, guys. And one, two, three. (RESUMES) - You scared? - Yeah. Yeah, me too. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. All right. I want you to go from there to here without walking. No runnin' either. How am I supposed to do that? I don't know. I don't know. Just use your imagination, man. Come on. Come on. Yeah, that's it. Now, something else. What else? I don't know. Something else. Like what? Well, anything. Walk like a monkey. Cluck like a chicken. I don't care. (CHUCKLES) Monkeys don't cluck. Oh, come on, man. Just do it. Come on. Yeah. (CLUCKING) Yeah. (CHITTERING) (CHITTERING) (CLUCKING) (CLUCKING) Good, man. How long should I keep doing this for? Till you get it right. Now, come on. Come on, man. Yes! Yes! Yes! (SQUEALING) What's up? Pork chops for dinner. (BOTH CLUCKING) What a dick. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. I got something for you. Your picture looked a little worse for the wear, so... Thanks. It's an old frame of my mother's. You didn't have to... I think... (BOTH CHUCKLE) Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. (PIANO PLAYING BLUES) MOLLY: Don't sleep much, do you? CABE: Mmm-mmm. MOLLY: What are you running from? CABE: What makes you think I'm runnin'? MOLLY: You're a runner, all right. (CAR ENGINE IDLING) - Good mornin'. - Good mornin'. What are you doin' up so early? Couldn't sleep. This is what I was looking forward to most about coming back here. Do you ride? Nah, we aren't allowed to ride 'em. Pretty good at cleanin' up their crap, though. Did you like the picture? Yeah. Listen, there's something I need to tell you. I never did get to thank you for the picture. I love this time of morning. Would you like to kiss me? Now walk like a monkey, cluck like a chicken. You know, I've been thinking. I've never done it before. Maybe you could teach me. Teach you? Yeah, 'cause it's gonna be a long, hot summer. Mmm-hmm. Do you ever let other people touch it? (WOMAN CLEARS THROAT) You mean my guitar? Of course. What else would I be talking about? (PLAYING ROCK AND ROLL) Okay, that's it. Just go. Let it go... All right, now, play. One... They are doing so much better now. They're actually starting to sound like a real band. It's your methods, Mr. Cabe, in the classroom. And those silly, stupid dances you're teaching Croft and Blaine out in the field... I'm trying to make it fun for them. You didn't see these kids when they came to me, Mr. Cabe. Delinquents, running with gangs... Control is the only thing that got 'em this far. Mr. Benedict, I am so sure that everything that you've done for these kids is great. Thank you. I just feel there are other ways of getting results, that's all. Mr. Cabe, I'm not gonna argue with you. I can always get me another music teacher. What do you guys want? Wanna hear some tunes, man. No. No more records. Why not? 'Cause you heard 'em all. That's all I got. So we'll listen to 'em again. Nope, I can't. Why can't we? I just can't, okay? It's Benedict, isn't it? He found out. It's okay. He gets to everybody sooner or later. Wait a minute. All right! Yes! Okay, any of you guys got a radio? - (LIGHTER CLICKS) - No. Why? - Forget it. - What? What? I'm not gonna get you all cranked up over nothin'. Forget it. Oh, come on. Tell us. (EXHALES) All right. All right, there's this deejay I know about. What's a deejay? Don't you know nothin', man? Tell him, Mr. Cabe. (CHUCKLES) Deejay's a disc jockey. The man who spins the platters on the radio. And there's this one fella in particular... Out of Memphis, I believe it is, and he plays the hottest rock and roll. I mean, real scorchers. Strictly underground stuff. Now, he calls himself the Midnight Rider. Everybody has tried to shut him down. I mean, parents, school teachers, the government, President Eisenhower... Tried to shut him down, but nobody could. He's always one step ahead of the law. Nobody can stop the Midnight Rider. How can we hear him? Well, like I said, you need a radio. (CLICKS TONGUE) You know, come to think of it, you probably even need a shortwave all the way out here to pick him up. Now, beat it! I can fix that old radio in the garage. There's a book in science class all about radios, and I can go from that. - All we need is the pieces. - Let's do it. - Sure you don't want me to do this? - No. I gotta do it. Keep your eyes peeled. Bradley! Bradley, come on! (DOOR OPENS) What are you doing? What's that? This is a project for science class. We're getting extra credit for taking apart radios, and examining what's inside of them. You can do better than that. We wanna listen to a radio show that Mr. Cabe told us about, and I need one of these to build a shortwave radio. - What show? - Midnight Rider. BIG BOY: Come on! He's coming, Bradley! Come on! Go on, take it. Take it. We listen to Midnight Rider at college. Yeah? Thank you, Sara. (CHUCKLES) JESSE: All right, now you sort of cradle the neck with your left hand. - And then you rest this on your knee. - SARA: Hmm. All right. Say, like, a "D" chord. What? Nothing. All right, now, you put your first finger on the second fret. This one here. That one there. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Now with your right... Well, now, you gotta hold on tighter here. - SARA: Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. All right. Now, strum. (CLEARS THROAT) (DISCORDANT NOTE) - It's good. - Sounds bad. It's good. That was good. (LAUGHING) - You know it sounds bad. - It was good. I got it! I got it! Okay, end the bridge. Coming off the verse, you play like you were before, right? (HUMMING MELODY) And then... And I'll answer you. And we'll do it four times, right? (GUITAR)(HUMMING MELODY) It'll be perfect! Shut up, shut up, shut up. Why do I you just keep doing the "D" chord? I got a problem. Ooh-wee. I guess Jesse's gonna win that bet after all. Shut up! Yeah. Hi, Sara. Hi, Bradley. Did you get that radio working? Yeah, yeah. Um, thank you for that. (DOOR CLOSES) You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. (INSECT BUZZING) What's wrong? Sara, there's something I have to tell you. A bet? A stupid bet? Come on. Let's win that bet for you. Come on. Here I am. (SIGHS) - That's what I thought. - Sara. Sara! It started out as a bet, but it's not about that anymore. That's a good one. That's almost as good as that sick lie you told me about your parents, or whoever those people in the picture were. You were using me to get at my father, weren't you? That's what this was all about? Well, I'm not my father, Jesse. (STATIC) Yeah. MAN: Now, let's start off with Lefty Frizzell... (MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (SWITCHING STATIONS) Come on, man. Find the Midnight Rider. I'm trying to. MAN: (DEEP VOICE) Are you out there, brothers of the night? That's it. Are you listening?

I'd learn how to fix it, though, 'cause it costs an arm and a leg to get that thing repaired. (CHUCKLES) Glad to have you back. You young people are coming to a time...

And now, in this new music. It is a foul, black music, godless and profane. I implore you to say no to it. Shout no to it. And now let's bow our heads in a moment of silent prayer, and ask God for the strength and courage to fight this evil that threatens the very foundation of our American way of life. Sara. Sara, I'm sorry about last night, about the bet, and everything. I got no excuses... Except that you scare me. I mean, that first day you showed up, I remember thinkin'... This is the kind of girl that that wouldn't ever want to have anything to do with me. So I guess I must've known already that... I liked you, and it scared me. You were right about the picture. Came with the wallet. It just looked like the kind of folks a guy should have, and I just sort of adopted 'em. So who were your parents? Who were my parents? Father was a wildcatter, and my mother was a waitress, or maybe she was a salesgirl, and he was in the service. Or maybe they were just two teenagers who met behind a bar. I guess you heard about the trouble we had at the Lizard Lounge last night. I am sorry, Travis. You were right. I should have fired the guy. I'll do it just as soon as I get back. I don't want you to do that. I've been doin' some checkin' around, like we talked about. I'm expecting a phone call from the sheriff in Biloxi, Mississippi. Seems as though they had some trouble down there a couple years back. The description could be Cabe. I ain't sure that it's him. But if it is, I don't want you to spook him, so sit tight. I want this man just as bad as you, Eugene. Just as bad as you. (PLAYING ROCK AND ROLL) We're cookin' now, daddy. (MUSIC STOPS) EUGENE: Who is responsible for this? I am. No, he's not. I am. It's me. You know who it is. All right, everybody back to the dormitory. You, come with me. I've been easy on you long enough now. This is your new bed. Get used to it. (RECEDING FOOTSTEPS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey, Jesse. Okay in there? Yeah, I'm fine. I thought you guys were headin' over to the girls' school. Yeah, we decided not to. Why? Well, you know. Look, you like her, don't you? I can't stop thinkin' about her. Then go down there and see her. Okay. Thanks, Jesse. BIG BOY: Alan, wait up. Come on, man, wait up. ALAN: Come on, slowpoke. BOY: Guys, keep it down. BRADLEY: What are you doin'? Be careful. What's he doin'? BIG BOY: You lame brain. What's it look like he's doin'? They're coming. ALAN: There she is. BRADLEY: Listen, maybe we should go. Come on. - Yeah, we should go. - Shut up, Willis. Come on. GIRL: Come on, let's go. BOY: Hey, turn the radio on. I'll be right back. Are you leaving? Come on, come on, come on. All right. MAN: This is the Midnight Rider, KZWR, ridin' on the silver waves of this moonlit night. Are you out there? Are you listenin'? Do you wanna dance?

Don't you ever just wanna go and keep on goin'? - Sure. - I know I do. I don't wanna see nothin' but blacktop for a couple thousand miles. Where would you go? There's this place, they've got this little bar and a stage in the corner. And on Friday nights, everybody comes down after work and gets to drinkin', and makin' all this noise... So you can barely hear the music. (BOTH LAUGH) But I wouldn't care. I'd just play. I'd just keep playin' till there wasn't anything left to play, and then I'd play until they drag me out. Where is it? I don't know. You'll find it. (EXHALES) (ROOSTER CROWS) (LIGHTER CLINKS) (POLICE RADIO CONVERSATIONS) (ROOSTER CROWS) Go! - BOY: What gives? - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) He's gone. What's goin' on? What are you doin' out here? I wanna know what happened. Your Mr. Cabe is a wanted man. He's a murderer. What's the matter with you guys? Don't let Benedict see you acting like this. How are we supposed to act? You tellin' me you believe what they're sayin' about Cabe? No, I suppose the cops just made it up, huh? I don't care what the cops say. Then where is he, Jesse? - Where did he go? - He'll be back. He'd be back if he was comin' back. You guys can go to hell. Jesse? Where you goin'? (VEHICLE STARTS) (JESSE WHOOPS) Go, Jesse! (LAUGHING) Yahoo! Yee-haw! CABE: Well, there was this friend of mine. Colored guy. We were playing gigs in Biloxi, Mississippi. All colored clubs. And then this one night, this guy who owned a white club came in. Heard us. He thought we were pretty good. And he offered us a gig at his club. He said that he didn't really care, you know, what color the musicians were, as long as they were good, and we were good. Josh tried to talk me out of it. He said that he didn't really think it was worth makin' the trouble over. But I don't know. There was just something about the idea, that they didn't want us there that made me wanna play that gig more than anything else in the world. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) So we played. At least we started to play. Got about eight bars through the first song, and then all the trouble started. Someone threw a beer bottle in Josh's face. Then someone had a knife. I tried to stop it with my hand, but it went right through my hand, and right into his gut. I swear, my hand was stuck to his belly. And I looked up, and there was this... Kind of puzzled look on his face. And I picked up this broken beer bottle, and I went after the son of a bitch who got Josh. So I got away. And I ran, and I ran. And I'm still runnin'. Maybe it's time to stop. Don't throw my own words back at me, boy. This is different. How is this different? Come on, get serious. You didn't do anything wrong. I killed a white man in order to help a colored man, and in Biloxi, Mississippi, that is as wrong as you get. Fight 'em. I'll help you. Come on, get out. Get out. Get the hell outta here, man. (EXHALES) - EUGENE: One, two, three. - ALL: Twenty-four. One, two, three. Twenty-five. - One, two, three. - Twenty-six. One, two, three. Twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty. Mr. Benedict? Can I come back? What was that, Mr. Tucker? Can I please come back? I won't cause you any more trouble. I just wanna come back. Hi. Hey. You okay? Fine. I waited for you after band practice. Yeah, I had to work in the yard. Left a note with Alan. Yeah, I know. I got it. What's the matter with you? (SCOFFS) You know, people have been asking me that my whole life. I wanna see you. I don't think that's such a good idea. Why not? Jesse? Why? 'Cause of your father, that's why. What do you think? Since when do you care what he thinks about anything? (SNIFFS) I'm gonna be leaving soon. Yeah, I know, and I'm not. You're gonna go off to college, and I'm gonna stay here and dig ditches for your old man. I just wanna put in my time and get outta here. And go where? 'Cause if you're looking for a place, there's a great spot with a stage... Where you can play... You don't get it, do you? You don't get it. Every time I hit, they hit me back harder. And every time I start to trust somebody... Jesse, you can trust me. And you're leavin', aren't you? (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) - (CALLIOPE PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN: Let's go... ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
