Just let me put my bicycle down and get things started and then we can talk. All right? The name's Billy Baker and this is my pub. You can call me "The Kid," if you like. That's the name I go under. That was my fighting name. 109 fights and I only lost three. And they weren't the last three either. I was Welterweight Champion of the British Isles and I fought them all. Charlie Madden, Ruben Murillo and... earned these ships. But the greatest fighter I ever stepped into a ring with was this one. Matilda. [somber music] That's right. A kangaroo. You know, if God created man and beast, then I'd have to say, he gave Matlida the most extraordinary talent. More than any other fighter that ever lived. [somber music] People think that ex-fighters like me end up owning pubs like this. But it's not true. In fact, most of us end up not being able to pay for our own drinks. [pleasant music] Matilda got me this. Like he got everything for everyone that ever knew him. Seems like only yesterday when me and Matilda arrived in America. Times were hard. We were hungry. And I'll tell you, New York isn't a place to be hungry. [screaming] [police sirens alarming] I tried explaining Matilda was just loving him. But the poor bloke was scared stiff when there was no calming anybody down. [pleasant music] [police siren alarming] [car horns honking] I didn't know what to do. I was desperate. They carted Matilda off to a dog jail. Then I saw in this show business paper a little advertisement on the bottom of the page that said, "Book with Bernie." [horn honking] But it was me only hope. [horn honking] [upbeat music] - Lee don't give no exhibition in Toledo for that kind of money. You tell Carter not to call me till he triples the money, and even then I ain't guaranteeing nothing. What do you got, a tape worm? No, no, not you. Forget it. And tell Carter, next time he calls me at lunch, make sure I ain't eaten. [phone ringing] - Hello, Book with Bernie. A knife throwing act, Mr. Matson? Sure I got it, the greatest! You never saw one like it. It's like everybody's hair is standing up when they see it. You've seen a lot of knife throwing acts, Mr. Matson, but never one where the man's blindfolded, the girl spins on a wheel. The lights go out. He got flaming torches at the end of the knives and the last one he throws at her got a firework inside which goes off! And when the lights come up, she got an American flag over her head! It's stupendous! [phone clicking] He loved it! - You wanna know something? You're dangerous. I mean, only a bent mind would think up an act like that. A broad on a flag with a wheel. - What are you, an impresario? - No, I'm the guy who pays the rent, your brother-in-law. The money you owe me, remember? - How could I forgot? You remind me five times a day. - There's one thing I can't stand and that's a person who don't appreciate what another person has done for him! Remember? - [Both] From the first day I married your sister, I took you in 'cause you was an orphan. I felt sorry 'cause you-- - "Were such a young kid to lose your mother and father." You abused my sister and never let her forget that you were giving me a free room! - Look, buddy, let's cut this out. Let's stop being polite to each other. Now I'll spell it out for you so you'll understand. You are, always were and always will be a loser! - [Both] With a capital "L." - So do me a favor. Pack this show business in. Get yourself a steady job because your kind of show business is over! O-V-E-R! Through! - Speaking of over, boxing is so crooked, it's one step away from wrestling. Nobody cares about it anymore! - They care about me. Don't they, Pinky? - Certainly, certainly, Champ. You're a public idol, they love you. - Don't make me laugh, you ain't had one fight this year. Pinky's dodging every serious contender. - What're you now, a boxing authority?! - I don't have to be. It says so right here in Duke Parkhurst's column. - Duke Parkhurst. What is this Parkhurst? A two-bit sports writer, can't put on his shoes. - Yeah, that's right, he's a bum. - Mr. Parkhurst just happens to be the most influential sports writer in the world. - What are you now, his publicity agent? [knocking] Yeah? You looking for something? - The name's Billy Baker. Former Welterweight Champion of the British Isles. Known as "the Burmazi Kid" - Sorry, we ain't hiring no seconds. - Have I the honor of address Mr. Bernie Bonnelli? - Mr. Bonnelli? Oh, this here is Mr. Bonnelli. The biggest impresario in New York. - Pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. So to speak, I've come on a matter of business. Allow me to introduce myself. Billy Baker, known at home and abroad as "the Burmazi Kid." - I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Baker, but you see, I've got nothing to do with boxing. I just book acts. - But I have an act, sir. Me and Matilda. - Matilda? What kind of act do you do? - We've got the greatest boxing act in the world, sir. - You box a lady? - Oh no, Matilda isn't a lady. He's a "he." He's the greatest boxing roo in the world. - A what? - A roo. A kangaroo. - Oh. - A roo! A boxing kangaroo, governor. [laughing] - I had a pair of slippers once made out of kangaroo. - Nobody's buying animal acts today. Maybe six months from now. - Well it's not just an act, sir. Matilda is the greatest boxer in the world. Well, no fighter has ever gone more than two round with him. - Sign him, buddy. He's the first guy I ever met who's even a bigger loser than you. I can't stand it anymore. Come on, Champ. [laughing] A roo. A boxing kangaroo. - Look at those sad, lonely eyes full of expressions of love. He's in a dog jail now, just at this minute. He's like a son to me, Mr. Bonnelli. He's all I've got in the world. - Look, Mr. Baker, I'm sorry, I wish I could help you but, you see, the fact is, I can barely help myself nowadays. I'm sorry. [somber music] - No. No. I couldn't eat knowing Matilda's starving in a prison somewhere. [somber music] [tires screeching] - Hey! You wanna pay? - Keep it running, we'll be out in a minute. Excuse me, lady. - You won't be sorry for this, Mr. Bernie. I promise you that, I promise. - Hello, I'd like to... Sir? Sir? Hello, could you help us, please? Mister, sir? Hello? - Mister, officer, officer, I've come for my kangaroo, Matilda. - Did you now? We get a lot of kangaroos here, hundreds. - Mister, would you look at it, please? Please, please, will you look at it? - Which one's yours? - Well, he's about as... Well, he's about as big as you are. But he's got the most beautiful grayish fur. - Look, bub, we got enough weird animals around here already. Maybe you two better be moving on before I run you in for disturbing the peace! - Eddie! Eddie, these people are serious. They love their pet as well as you love your children. - I hate my children, Smith. What's with that kangaroo? - You're right, ma'am, that kangaroo is like a son to him and me. - They're checking to see who got gassed today. - Gassed? - Gassed? - If anything happened to this man's son, we'll sue everybody! The city, the state! - No, no, the worst that could've happened is they've taken him to the zoo. - A zoo? But... But Matilda isn't a wild animal. - You guys think you can take an innocent kid and throw him behind bars? No way! - Eddie, you see, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You're not only totally insensitive to animals but people, these are people and they have feelings. - Yeah, we have feelings. By the way, my name is Bonnelli, Bernie Bonnelli. I'm a theatrical agent. - Why, I'm Kathleen Smith and I've worked for the Association For the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. - Oh. - [Billy] That's him! That's Matilda. They found him! - Okay, wise guys. Come and get that kangaroo out of here and get him out of here but quick or we'll gas him. He just boxed one of out guys in there. You better hope he ain't dead. - He knocked him out? - Zap, one punch and poor Stanley, he awfully had a pounding and laying on his back smiling. Out like a light. - Matilda wouldn't hurt anybody. He was just playing. He loves to box. - [Billy Voiceover] Things were looking up until Bernie invited Miss Smith to watch Matilda box, then she nearly went bonkers. - Well I'm very sorry but I cannot allow this. - I can't believe this woman. - I said, I will not permit this! - Listen, lady, I have always suspected people like you who do goody-good things for animals and whatever. There's something inside of them, in their lives, that ain't working. Something empty. So fill yourself up with something besides my marsupial. [silly music] - What the hell is that? - My first wife, come in. - Look, just forget about it. Just give me my money and I'll get out of here. - Here's an extra 50, come on. - Hey, what're you guys, a joke? I've got my meter running for over an hour now. - What're you complaining about, making money? Here, see? That's just the tip, okay? [silly music] - All right, whatever she does in that cab, you guys have to clean up. - Listen, mister, that kangaroo is as clean as you are. And he can hold his water like a camel. [silly music] - Would I ever lie to you, Mr. Donohue? - Don't talk to me like we met five minutes ago. I can't remember the last time you told me the truth. - Oh, I was just trying to help Pinky, you know? Lying to family doesn't count. But now I'm telling you for real, Mr. Donohue. This is the greatest fighter that ever walked. Hopped. - Look, cut the bologna, Bonnelli, it ain't necessary. The only reason I let this misguided creature in here is because I like you. - Thanks, Mr. Donohue. Okay, let's do it! [clapping] - What's happening? What's going on? - [Man] He's putting a little class in the joint. [bell ringing] [crowd cheering] [thudding] - I gotta make a phone call. [men shouting] I can't hear myself getting rich. Mr. Matson, am I glad I found you! I got good news an bad news. First the bad news, Mr. Matson. The knife throwing act is out. [crowed cheering] I got a kangaroo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, an act with a kangaroo. A boxing kangaroo, Mr. Matson. He's undefeated with... [thudding] [crowd cheering] Six straight knockouts! Listen to me, Mr. Matson, this show is rated G. Something for everybody. I am giving 500 dollars, Mr. Matson, 500 dollars to anyone who can stay two regulation rounds with my kangaroo! Of course I'll supply the 500 dollars, Mr. Matson. Would I be calling you if I didn't have the money? My chauffeur is right outside, Mr. Matson. We're almost there. [upbeat music] - [Driver] I just called my friend, Duke. Duke Parkhurst, you ever hear of him? Well, he's a sports writer here in town. Anyway, he's gonna give you guys a plug, you know, mention the kangaroo. - How long have you known Parkhurst, Gordon? - I've been giving him tips for years. Huh? Strictly confidential stuff. You know, you'd be surprised what you hear in a cab. - No, I wouldn't. Life is really funny, isn't it? - I don't know what you mean. - Why do you think, with all the cabs in New York, we got into this one? - Well, he was the only one who would stop. - Right. But why did he stop? Why did he put his foot on the break? - I don't know. Why did he put his foot on the break? - Fate. Fate! How else can you explain it? There we were, you, me and Matilda, standing on Broadway on our way to the big times, lacking only one thing. A guy with a lot of style who could handle a lot of problems. - [Billy] We were? - And screech, this cab pulls up and who's at the wheel? - Gordon. - Gordon Baum, right! Someone sent him to us. Gordon, how would you like to be in business with us? [laughing] To have responsibilities for a champion, Gordon, a real star. You own five percent of Matilda and you get to see your name in the press. - Listen, I'm not interested in any other businesses. - Gordon, this isn't any other businesses. It's show business. [exciting instrumental music] [horn honking] No, no, no. You wait in the car. Wait in the car. I'm just going inside for a minute to see my financier. [pleasant piano music] Ah, flowers. ♪ I'm irresponsibly mad ♪ For you ♪ For you ♪ For ♪ You - For you. - Oh, you shouldn't have. - Yeah! [clapping] Bravo! [people chattering] - They're plastic. - I know, they'll last longer. Well, baby, it's finally happened. I had to come tell you myself. - What? - The big time. The whole enchilada. The Hollywood Bowl. I am introducing you to the coast myself. - Oh, I knew it, Bernie. I never doubted you, even when all my friends said all those bad things about you. Oh, Bernie, you're the best agent in the whole world. - First there's this other deal I got to put to bed. - Really, what deal? - Tanya, my sweet, the gods have smiled upon us. They have given us Matilda! - Matilda! - Matilda, my dear, is a fighter. The greatest fighter in the world! - A fighter? But I wanna sing in Hollywood, not Madison Square Garden. - Tanya, believe me, this is your ticket to greatness. If I didn't think so, I'd never take the 500 dollars. - 500 dollars? What 500 dollars? - Don't worry, it's nothing. It's just an advance on next week's salary. I'll get it from Sabuncakis. You got two points in Matilda. Think Hollywood. - "Think Hollywood." - Hey, that's Lee Dockerty over there, isn't it? What's he doing here? - Oh yeah. I don't know, how comes in here everyday, eyeballing me and sitting there behind those dark glasses and drinking beer. - Tonya, you be nice to him. You're gonna go out with him tonight. [whispering] - Uh huh. [pleasant music] - We're in! Come on, hit it. All I need now is a boxing license from the commissioner. - [Gordon] Buffalo Bill? Wildman? He ain't gonna give you no boxing license, that crazy cowboy. [Gordon laughing] - [Bernie] Just stop at a western store first. I'll take care of all the rest. - What part of Arizona you say you're from? - Family's got a spread outside of Wickenburg. - Well, what can I do for you? - I need a license. Billy's got a match tomorrow night and I want everything I proper accord with the high standards of your office. - Well, son, boxing's been my life. Anybody come around here messing with the rules trying to bust 'em gonna have to answer to me. - Commissioner, this fight will be a credit to you and the profession. It's a classic battle between experience against strength. - Oh, you mean the other boy is strong, huh? - Matilda, he's an animal. - Well, the champ, here, looks looks like he's about ready to ride into the sunset. - Oh, Billy, here, is still a howling coyote. Right, partner? Woo! - This fella, Matilda, that's a strange name for a boy. - Partner, he's a wild-fighting critter. He's a tough western boy. Heck, fuzzy! Woo! - Well, heck fuzzy yourself! With a name like Matilda, he must've been fighting all his life. Unless he's strange. Strange, if you know what I mean? [carnival music] - [Announcer] Matson's Monster Carnival is proud to present our feature attraction! - If you brought me out here on a wild goose chase, Gordon, so help me, I'll take you apart. - Mr. Parkhurst, have I ever give you a bad tip? I'm telling you, Dockerty is gonna be here tonight. Fighting. - That is absolutely preposterous. [crowd commotion] - Hurry, hurry, step right up, ladies and gentlemen and see the wild only boxing kangaroo, as trained by Captain Billy Baker, "the Burmazi Kid," the Champion of all of the British Isles! Ladies and gentlemen! Matson's Monster Carnival is very proud to present our feature attraction! Captain Billy Baker and the one and only Matilda! [crowd applauding] Matilda will put on an exhibition unparalleled in the anales of pugilism! - It's almost human. Just like I told you, huh, Mr. Parkhurst? I mean, your eyes don't lie, look at it! [thudding] [crowd cheering] [clapping] - Now, for the coup de gras! The special event of the night! Matson's Monster Carnival will give to anyone, anyone that wants to come up into this ring and go two rounds with Matilda without being knocked down, we will give them 500 dollars. [crowd cheering] 500 dollars! Matson's Carnival will accept no responsibility for injury or death! So, if you wanna fight... [booing] If you wanna fight, you gotta come up into the ring and sign a release! - This must be a fake. Tell 'em champ, they'll listen to you, tell 'em! - This is a setup! - Do I gather that you are challenging Matilda?! - You bet your sweet patootie I am! - I don't believe it. He's signing to fight that kangaroo and he wouldn't fight Cyclone Roberts. [crowd applauding] What a woman can get a man to do. [laughing] - The last one to get knocked down must go to the farthest corner, remain there until-- - That's the Heavyweight Champion of the world. You didn't tell me Matilda would have to fight him. - Relax, kid, everything's gonna be all right. - But he's all I've got. - All right, shake hands! - I don't want to let him get hurt. [applauding] [Matilda whimpering] I'm sorry, I didn't know. [bell ringing] [crowd cheering] [swishing] [thudding] [crowd cheering] - Whoa! - Two! Three! Four! [crowd cheering] - [Billy Voiceover] Nobody in the boxing world knew that a big underworld boss called Uncle Nono owned the champ, Lee Dockerty. He didn't like what had happened. - "Don't kiss me again! "Your corespondent witnessed an example of this "when dropping Lee Dockerty for the count. "Matilda, deposited a moist kiss "full on Lee's mouth. "His trainer "refers to it as the kiss of death "and prepares to... [door thudding] "And prepares to sweep up the remains "with its recipient. [dramatic music] "Matilda of Australia, new Heavyweight Champion, "knocked out title holder Lee Dockerty "in 37 seconds of the first round!" Then after stating that Dockerty's manager was not present, Parkhurst hails the new champion a boxer, a fighter a kangaroo! Ayuadame. Ayuadame, help me, help me. [sighing] This does not make Nono very happy. - Listen, boss. - Why did you let Dockerty out of your sight? That's what you're being paid for. To see that Parkhurst does not get another chance to write this kind of junk! [snapping] - [Gangster] Senor Macante. - Boss, please, please, believe me. I didn't know that he was desperate for a girl. - [Gangster] And you! Where were you?! - Hey, I figured Pinky knew. He works in the same office with Bernie. - I work for the same office? That idiot is my brother-in-law, otherwise I would've thrown him out years ago! You see, he was an orphan. He never had a shot in life and I was gonna give-- [yelling foreign language] Dockerty gets flattened. Macante thought this! Your sister's brother is an orphan and he never got his shot! Why is this?! Imbeciles! [yelling foreign word] I'll tell you, the next time this kind of thing happens again, all of your kids are gonna be orphans, is that understood? [foreboding music] - Well, you're my lawyer, do something! What're you doing? - I'm throwing your junk out of my office! You, Bernie Bonnelli, are a Judas! - Marty, stay right there, I'll call you back. [ominous music] [muffled speaking on phone] Would you mind explaining the meaning of this? - The meaning is simple. I'm gonna kill you. - Wait, the boss don't want no one hit. - Shut up, you nitwit! - Listen, don't scare me with your numbers. Bernie don't scare! This is ridiculous, you can't put this stuff out here in the hallway and just leave it! - We're not! We're gonna burn it with you on the top! - Be nice or I won't give you a rematch. - What do you mean, rematch?! There was never a match. It was only some dopey publicity stunt you dreamed up! - Yeah! - Be careful, Bernie! You are getting the wrong peoples mad. [foreboding music] [office commotion] - What's Parkhurst wanna see me about? - I don't know but when Parkhurst wants to see you, you go, not later, not tomorrow but now. - If it's important, it's gotta be something good, right? - Hello, Betty. This is Bernie Bonnelli. Mr. Parkhurst wants to see him. - He's waiting, please go in. Gordon, Mr. Parkhurst wants to see him in private. - Sit down. - I'm Bernie Bonnelli. Matilda's manager. - Yeah, I know who you are, that's why you're here. - Okay, what do you want? - Do you know who owns Dockerty? - Pinky Schwab and a couple other guys. - Pink Schwab is just one step below of being a moron. Uncle Nono owns Dockerty, kid. He's the biggest gangster in the United States and I'm going to put him put of boxing for good. - What's that gotta do with me? - You and Billy Baker have a good thing going with Matilda right now but so far it's just a circus act. But I'm going to make it better. You do what I tell you, you'll make money and I'll get Uncle Nono. - I got a feeling you get Nono, I get buried. - That's the gamble you're gonna have to take if you wanna make a million bucks. - A million bucks?! - That's what it's worth to get Dockerty in the ring with Matilda. You interested? - Is Rolls interested in Royce? - Okay. Now you arrange the fights, I write about them. Nobody knows about our deal. So when Nono comes down on you, you keep your mouth shut, you don't call me. We understand each other? - You got yourself a deal, Mr. Parkhurst. - Oh, incidentally, very important, you take care of Kathleen Smith and the ASPCA first. I hear on the grape vine that she's taking you to court. - She is being taken care of immediately. - [Gordon] Are you sure this is the place? - [Bernie] Sure I'm sure, can't you read English? - [Gordon] Don't get mad, I'm only asking. [dogs whimpering] [dogs barking] - Come on, come on, good dogs. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, sweetie. Hey. Come on, come one, what a nice dog. [dogs barking] - Come on, Charlie. [dogs barking] - Hi! Fancy meeting you out here. Do you live here? I walk down this street every day. Hello. - How nice, Mr. Bonnelli. - This is the part of the day I always look forward to, to be with my animals. They're mostly strays I picked up. I can't stand to see an animal suffer. - Mr. Bonnelli, why do I get this feeling there's something you're trying so hard to tell me? - Miss Smith, you've got me wrong. When I wanna tell somebody something, I tell them straight out. Like the whole Matilda thing. Do you really think that I would ever, ever let anybody hurt him? I mean, that kangaroo's like family to me. - Family? People don't exploit their family. - But who's exploiting anybody? Do you think anyone can teach a kangaroo to fight? No way, it's a natural thing. It's their sex drive. God gave it to them just like He gave it to us. They fight and we... How tall are you? - What? - I mean, you sure got long legs for a lady your size, you know that? [dogs barking] - My injunction is going to stand. Matilda is not going to fight again. Will you excuse me, please? - Miss Smith, listen to me! [dogs barking] Ow, ow, ow! Oh, you bit me, ow! [Gordon laughing] - Sit down. Come on, sit. Here, hold Charlie. Let's take the shoe off. No, we must take the shoe off to see if the skin is broke. - No, it's nothing, really. [dogs barking] - My goodness. Why am I so disappointed that you are not bleeding, Mr. Bonnelli? - What? - You know, it's just amazing that for a man your size, your legs are so ugly. That must do terrible things for your ego. Can I have Charlie, please? - What are you, some kind of sadist working for the Prevention of Cruelty for Animals? - I can tell you this, I've never been so inspired to stop anyone as I am now, Mr. Bonnelli. [dog whimpering] Oh, here boys. Here, fellas. Fetch! [dogs barking] - What're you doing? What're you, crazy?! - Fetch, Bonnelli. Fetch. [dogs whimpering] [dogs barking] - You know what that was all about, don't you? - Yeah, guess she didn't go for it, huh? - You think she really cares about stopping a fight? That's her way to sticking it to my life and you know something? I don't think she can fight it, what do you think of that? [dogs barking] Ugly legs. - Who? - Well Miss Smith is gonna have to learn the hard way. No more Mr. Nice Guy! We'll be gone, fighting around the country, while my long-legged friend spends her life trying to get an injunction against us in every state in the Union. Gordon, partner, you ever think of selling this cab? [upbeat music] - [Billy Voiceover] For the next six months, we crisscrossed the United States taking on every contender for the title. Slowly working our way to a championship fight. We went to some very strange places. Tuskaloosa, Chattanooga. Tallahassee, Albuquerque, Indianapolis, Minneapolis. We had seven fights and Matilda killed 'em all in the first round. It was very tiring but it was all happy being one family, so to speak. Bernie, bless his heart, was saving some money for us all but he always insisted, even though we didn't spend a lot, we always ate good. - Thanks. - Oh, just a minute, sir. - Oh. That's a sundae for Matilda. - Thank you, come back again. [upbeat music] [children laughing] [Matilda chirping] - [Girl] I want chocolate. - Hello. What're you doing? What are you doing? - Do you really think you could stop me by leaving New York? - I tried calling to say goodbye but your phone was busy. - Oh, well why didn't you write me a letter? I got the bill for your shoes. - Well, those were Bally loafers. - Oh, well, they only ate one. - I'm sorry. Eat one, you gotta pay for two. Did you follow me to Oklahoma? - Don't flatter yourself. Been down at the state capital trying to get an injunction to stop this fight. - Oh. - [Kathleen] They wouldn't grant it. - Oh. - I read in the papers where your next fight is in Los Angeles. - Yeah, that's right, why? - Oh, my brother's the boxing commissioner of the state of California. [pleasant music] [doorbell buzzing] Come in! Just leave it there in the front room, please. [pleasant music] Get out! - Listen, I want to be friends. Can we be friends? - No, get out! - Most women, when they come out of the shower and they're in a bathrobe and their hair's like that are supposed to look pretty but they never do. You do. It's not great but it's friendly. Here. [splashing] [lips smacking] It's not great but it's friendly. - I never thought that it was possible to hate anybody as much as I hate you but I have achieved the impossible. When are you gonna give it up?! - It's great but it's not friendly. - I have this curious notion that you have come up here to try and tell me something and you just don't know quite how to say it. - I'm not kidding, I wanna be friends. - Oh, is it my irresistible beauty or does it have something to do with the fact that my brother is the head of the boxing commission of California? - The honest answer to that is "yes to both," why not? I'm fighting for the life of a man and a marsupial that I give a damn about. Someday, if we really get to be friends, I'll tell you about what I think of the prevention of cruelty to people. You keep talking about marsupials. Did you happen to see my English friend who was once Welterweight Champion of England? That's important, lady! I don't think you understand how important that is, that a man who was Welterweight Champion is suddenly walking on his knees starving to death and has nothing but a one-way ticket to the poor house. That might not mean anything to you but it means something to me! Here. Have a shoe. I'll send you a bill in the morning. [door slamming] [silly music] - [Bernardo] Okay, we throw a net over the beast and this time we kidnap him! - [Macante] Even if we kidnap the kangaroo, how're we gonna get them in this trunk? - He's no bigger than a body. You, are you sure it's gonna be here, this kangaroo? - I told you for the last time, he comes up and down this trail. - Well I'm just checking, I don't want no more trouble! [men grumbling] Now go! - Come on. - [Bernardo] I hope this works because if it doesn't, the boss finds out, it's concrete Keds for us. [men arguing] - Come on, would you please hurry up?! - [Bernardo] All right, all right, all right! - When I give the signal, drop it right here! - All right, we hear you! Only a moron would try to kidnap this beast. This is ridiculous! [ominous music] [Matilda cooing] [thudding] - Throw it! What is this beast? He's killin', he choking me! Help, he's choke! [gagging] - We gotta get Macante out! - What's the problem? Simple! [thudding] - [Macante] Ow! Get me out of this! Ow, you idiot, what're you doing?! - Stupid, hit the one with the big ears! - I'll hit you in your big ears! [gagging] - I'm gonna feel around, when I don't feel no fur, Tito's gonna lift up the net and we're gonna let you out! Capeesh?! - All right, get out, get out! [thudding] - [Macante] Hey, I'm still in here! Hey, you! - [Bernardo] Move! Move! Let's get out of here! Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screeching] [pleasant music] - Ladies and gentleman, your attention please, this is the main event of the evening. [crowd cheering] 10 rounds of heavyweight boxing. Introducing to you first, at a hundred and 87 pounds, from Sydney, Australia, the great Matilda! [crowd cheering] And in this corner, wearing blue trunks with the gold stripes, one hundred and 96 and a half pounds, from Stillwater, Oklahoma, the number two champion in the world, Cowboy Joe! [crowd cheering] [crowd shouting] [bell ringing] [thudding] [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] - [Billy] Bernie, I hope you don't mind, but when you see Miss Kathleen's brother, don't upset him. If we don't get the license for the fight, we've come all this way to California for nothing. [upbeat music] - You propose to stage a ten round fight between a former Middleweight Champion, Cyclone Roberts of Peoria, and a kangaroo? - [Bernie] That's right. - And you're asking us to issue a license for this? What do you take us for, Mr. Bonnelli? - I'm not talking anybody for anything. My fighter, Matilda, ain't no ordinary kangaroo. Knocked out Lee Dockerty and 11 other guys. He's licensed in 10 states and is a serious contender for the championship. - You won't get a license in California. - Why not? - We'll not allow that kind of a freak show in this state. Take your circus and get out of town. - I told your sister and now I'm telling you, you don't run this world because you don't own it! [pleasant music] Who do those people think they are? "Freak show." I ain't been around all these years to have that brother and sister act stop us now. Nothing, nothing stops Bonnelli! Take me to Herman Caplin. - [Billy] Who's Herman Caplin? - [Bernie] A friend. - [Billy] What does he do, Bernie? - He runs a big advertising agency. [upbeat music] I did it, I did it, I did it! We are gonna be on TV. I sold the television show to my old friend, Herman Caplin! - A television show? - Right! Matilda boxes Cyclone on the show. It's a phony story but everybody knows the fight's for real in the studio and they get into the ring. - Oh, Bernie, you're infinitely special. - Do you know something? - What? - I should've been a genius or something. [laughing] - [Gordon] You mean a TV show that has the real fight in it, huh? That's terrific! [Gordon laughing] - All right. I'm gonna teach you the advantages of an education. Come on. All right. Now, here we have our champ, Dockerty. Observe. He is a human being. He has two legs, huh? See the dots? One. Two. Repeat. - [Men] One. Two. - All right, now here we have our kangaroo. Now, can you tell me the difference, Macante? Huh? - He's got a tail. [laughing] - That's beautiful, Macante! That's beautiful, beautiful! All right! But not just a tail, not just a tail! Bernardo, what else do you see? - Yeah, he's got a long tail. - No, you stupid... What else do you see? - Oh. He's got skinny legs. - No, you idiot! He's got an extra dot! He's got three dots! This kangaroo's been fighting with three dots! One, two, three! - [Men] One, two, three. - While Dockerty's only fighting with two dots. One, two. - [Men] One, two. - That ain't fair, I'm gonna call the commissioner. - And what're you gonna tell the commissioner? - About the extra dot. - No, you stupid! You cut off the head of a snake and the body dies. [thunder rumbling] You cut off the tail of a kangaroo and what happens? Well, come on, what happens?! Huh? He looses his dot. His extra dot! He falls down, he can't fight anymore. You understand? Do you understand or am I talking to myself?! - Oh yeah, no, we understand, he falls down! - Oh! [ominous music] [speaking foreign language] - Boss, are we really gonna put out a contract to cut off the kangaroo's tail? - Boss. Please, no disrespect intended. Who am I gonna get to do this? A butcher? - No. Two of my best men. Both of you are gonna go to Los Angeles and you're gonna chop it off! [ominous music] - [Bernie] Miss Smith thought she was gonna get her little brother to stop Bernie Bonnelli, ha, ha! Well, would you like to see their faces when they see Matilda fight Cyclone on TV, nationwide?! - [Kathleen Voiceover] Dear Bernie, I'm sorry the fight was called off. Can I buy you dinner? Can we be friends? [pleasant music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello, Billy, listen, Billy, we don't eat tonight. - We don't? - Together. I've been invited upstairs to eat by Miss Smith. She's feeling guilty and I'm going to her room now to make her meal even more guilty because she things she ruined our chances. Sweet dreams to you, Gordon and Matilda, goodnight. [pleasant music] Forgive me but if the shoes fits... [doorbell ringing] [somber music] - Come in. Please, come in. Are you all right? Would you like something to eat? - I don't wanna eat. - Drink? Maybe you'd like something to drink. - What difference does it make? - I've never seen you like this. Your voice is even different. Here. Here. I'll take the shoe. No, it's all right, I'll give it back later and you can take it home. It's okay. - I'm a bum again. I'm on the outside looking in. I'm nothing. I'm a loser. - Oh, Lord, Bernie, you're anything but a loser. You are the most amazing man I have ever met in my life. Oh, Bernie. I've never seen a man with such energy. And I've never seen a man who tried with all his might to obtain the impossible. And, you know, you know, you almost succeeded. Don't you realize how truly great you are? - I'm not thinking too clearly. I have a terrible headache. - Oh, a headache. [pleasant music] - As a matter of fact, my whole neck. - Oh, your neck? - And my whole back. - Your back too? - Oh yes. Ah. Oh. Oh. Oh, I'll tell you something, Miss Smith. - Yes? - You're in another world. You don't understand, I get a chance like this once in a lifetime. It's gone, you don't get two chances at something like this. Oh. Ah. [pleasant music] Can I have another drink, please? - Sure. [pleasant instrumental music] Bernie, I think you've had enough. - God, if you only knew what I have to go though. I mean, I don't have any money and Billy's ruined and Matilda's ruined and it's all my fault. - Oh, no. Bernie, no. It's the opposite, absolutely the opposite. Here, sit up. Oh, Bernie, it's because of you that they existed, that they even had the chance. They even had the chance. - But they don't have any chance anymore, don't you see? - Oh, no, no. [shushing] I think you should just relax. Just relax for a little while. Okay? [pleasant music] Oh. That's it. Just relax. Relax. [ominous music] - Here they come. Now remember, when I ask the animal for his autograph, you got just enough time to do what you gotta do. Think, we get in the car, we're gone and the dot's gone. Capeesh? - I know what I'm supposed to do. [speaking foreign language] - I'm just checking. Why you always get upset about everything? - When I'm through, the kangaroo's too. - I love you. Excuse me. Gentlemen? Excuse me, please, somebody? I'd like to get his autograph, please? It's for my kid. - [Billy] Oh, oh. - [Bernardo] I really would appreciate it. - Sign here. [Matilda cooing] - [Bernardo] Thanks a lot, really. I really appreciated that. - Ah, look at you. [whooshing] [groaning] [smacking] [Matilda giggling] - [Billy Voiceover] Bernie's idea of doing a show where Matilda fights Cyclone Roberts was my debut as an actor. And if I must say so myself, it was a milestone in television history. - Oh! - [Both] He's our Matilda that we saved in the desert when he was just a little roo. - [Old Woman] Maybe he'll pay us back by fighting that mean Cyclone Roberts. - Do you believe this? Do you believe this? - Pardon me, ma'am, you saved his life... Too. - [TV Narrator] Dear Matilda agreed to fight Cyclone Roberts and give his share of the purse. - [Announcer] Okay, switch cameras to the ring. [crowd shouting] And here we are, live, from Olympia Auditorium where the boxing event you've all been waiting for is about to begin! Matilda vs. Cyclone Roberts! [bell ringing] [crowd cheering] He knows Matilda can hit. He throws a jab. Way short. Cyclone dancing around now. Cyclone steps up. Pulls a jab, Matilda comes back. What a devastating hook to the head! Cyclone is down! The referee is counting but it's a waste of time. Cyclone is out cold! That's it, it's all over. Once again, Matilda has stopped his opponent in the first round! Listen to that crowd, they love it! [glass shattering] [whooshing] [glass shattering] [plane rumbling] [tires screeching] [phone ringing] - Ah, the great Bernie Bonnelli. The rope burner, the world beater, the impresario! - This is Billy Baker, the Burmazi Kid. - Glad to know you. You know, I used to think you were just a hustler, but I guess I was wrong. - Coming from you, that scares me, what's up? Why did you have us fly back? - Good news and bad news. The championship fight is on in Reno. Congratulations. - Hey! Hey! Hey! - We've done it, Bernie, we've done it! - Bad news is, you're all working for free. - [Both] Free? - You heard me, for free. Nobody gets anything except the Free Food Fund for Hungry Children in New York. - [Bernie] But what about hungry trainer and a hungry manager? - Listen, I've been waiting for five years for the chance to nail Uncle Nono and this is the only way I could make it work. Give the entire gate to charity. He had to agree to the match or else he'd be bared from ever promoting another match anywhere in this country. - Well when did all this happen? - Just a little while ago. I figure when things got tough, the thought of a million bucks would keep you going. - Well thank you, we finally make it over the rainbow to find out that the pot's empty! - Bonnelli, look, after this fight, everything is yours. But for now, I'm gonna give you a chance for once in your life to do the right thing. Help somebody else. - What did you ever give away, Duke? A few funny lines to some guy who got his head handed to him in the loosing end of a fight so you could sell some more papers? Billy, Mr. Parkhurst, here, knew all the time that I would go along with it. He could spot a sucker like me a mile away, chasing a dream, but I ain't talking for you or Matilda. - Well... Well, it's whatever you say, Bernie. You're the only one that's ever been nice to Matilda and me. - It's gonna be Matilda's toughest fight. But the man's right about cleaning up the sport and helping the kids. - Well it's all right by Matilda and me if you say so, Bernie. You'd never do anything wrong to us. - Mr. Parkhurst, you've got yourself the fight of the century to write about. [upbeat music] - [Billy Voiceover] We trained hard from early morning till late every day. But the champ was training hard too. He was determined Matilda wouldn't win this fight. It was gonna be the fight of Lee Dockerty's life. Tanya felt badly after what had happened to Dockerty at the carnival and she became Lee's greatest fan. [upbeat music] [Matilda grunting] - [Pinky] Great, champ! You're looking great. [Pinky grunting] [pleasant music] - He deserves it. [Matilda cooing] [somber music] Everything okay, Harry? - Fine, Mr. Bonnelli, all peace and quiet. - Look, I just came in here to see if you were all right, champ. You funny beast. Matilda. Matilda, where are you coming from, Matilda? Who made you? And why? Why? Why should you, the most funny-looking put together animal in the world, have this great talent? Has the spirit of Dempsey and Sugar Ray entered your body? But why you, Matilda? Other kangaroos are in circuses and zoos and carnivals, but never, no one, no one like you. You're going along with what started out as a gag and now laughing your head off? But whatever it is, there's something I wanna say. No matter how we make out, you and Billy are winners and for the first time in my life, you've made me a winner too. Thanks. [Matilda cooing] [somber music] [crickets chirping] - Hey. - Oh, hello. Happy to see you. - How you been? - Oh, I've been fine, how are you? - Everything's fine? - Yeah, everything is wonderful. - Bern. The car. - Yeah, get in. - [Bernie] Ha, ha, ha. - Come on, Bern, in the car. - [Bernie] This is a nice car. Are we going for a ride? - [Bernardo] Hey, paesano, relax. You want a drink? - [Macante] Yeah, turn on the TV. [pleasant music] - Now look, kid, this could be a short night if you're smart or it could be a longer one if you're not. Come here. You, Bonnelli, you've caused me a lot of grief. You've taken apart an organization that's taken me years to develop. My men, they're morons. So, Uncle Nono has to take care of business himself. This is for you. I've already signed it. You are now the owner of Lee Dockerty after the fight tomorrow night. This one, here, you sign. And I own Matilda at the same time. You wanna sign? [snapping] [guns clicking] - You ain't thinking clear. Kill me and Billy makes Matilda fight anyways. You can't win. - When we get through with you, we're going back to that camp and we whack out of the Englishman and the kangaroo. - Even you couldn't take the heat that would come down after that. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. You didn't get to the top doing stuff like that. Them, maybe, but not you. [laughing] - You're all right, kid. I like you, like your style. If you ever decide to get out of the boxing racket, you got a position with me and my organization. - Uh-uh. - No, no, no, I mean it, strictly legit. Straight. I own 45 different businesses between manufacturing and leisure time activities. - Are they your board of directors? - You gotta understand one thing, business is business but that does not include boxing. Boxing is my hobby. - You're really just a sportsman at heart. - Yeah. I mean, what's wrong with wanting to own a heavyweight champ? Tell me. Vanderbilt would like to own a winning horse in the Derby, right? Why not? - They work it another way. - Work? Come on, they never worked an honest day in their life. They bought the best their money could buy. It's the American way. That's what our parents came here for. And don't you forget it. All right, take Mr. Bonnelli back. No hard feelings, kid. - No. I'll see you. [somber music] - Hey, Macante. I want you to call Reno and tell them I want to lay a million dollars on the kangaroo tomorrow. - Boss, that's a lot of money. - Would you do what I tell you? [airplane whooshing] [exciting music] - [Announcer] American Airlines flight 42 from Mexico City and Acapulco arriving at gate six. Flight 19 from Sydney, Melbourne and Tokyo, arriving at gate nine. [exciting music] - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! I'm John Dunphy, your ringside commentator, welcoming you from Paris Hotel in Reno, on a cool, crisp evening for the Lee Dockerty/Matilda fight for the Heavyweight crown. They're all here! The wealthy, the near wealthy, the politicians, the stage and screen stars and of course, the sportsmen! A cross section of the rich and powerful from all over the globe. They've traveled thousands of miles to see this little square above me, where, here in a few moments, probably the two finest fighting machine of all time are going to meet each other. But ladies and gentlemen, never have the championship fights been so clouded by rumors. There's a report that both camps have bought off the judges, that Dockerty is terrified and plans to take a dive right after the opening bell. There's a report that somebody's been doping Matilda's breakfast food! And another has it that Lee Dockerty has hurt his left hand in sparing and is going to take a dive right after the opening bell. - Hey, Duke, how are you? Who do you like? - I don't guess you read my column. Matilda in two. - Could be. I saw the rerun of the last fight in Chicago on TV. - Are you betting? - No, I don't bet fights. Congratulations. - [John] And here comes the champion from the far corner of the Colosseum. Lee Dockerty, the Heavyweight Champion of the World is on his way to the ring! And there's a mixed reaction from the crowd. A lot of them were for him. - Billy, what's wrong? I don't know how to tell you. I know I should've told you before. - Well come on, nothing could be that bad. We made it to the top, didn't we? - Yeah! - Bernie, if a kangaroo is hit, he won't fight anymore. - You told me they box natural in their wild state, that he was merely using what they did natural for the act. - That's right, they do. But it's not boxing as we know it. When kangaroos box, they don't do it to hurt each other. The one that gets the first wallop wins. The other one stops right there and then and he'll never fight again. - Matilda flattened the champ, didn't he? - Dockerty had had a few drinks that night. Matilda nailed him, you know that. Cyclone and Cowboy Jones? - I knew they were washed up. We were all lucky. Dockerty is not drunk tonight. And unless Matilda gets him first, Dockerty's gonna take him apart. [crowd booing] - I've never seen Lee Dockerty in such wonderful condition. He's taking this fight seriously. Mentally and physically. He's ready for the fight of his life! And he better be! [crowd cheering] And here comes the challenger! The challenger is greeted by a tremendous voice from the crowd! Matilda! The challenger for the Heavyweight crown is on his way into the ring! This is the most unusual Heavyweight Championship fight in history! Man against beast! Who is going to win? [exciting marching band music] But nevertheless, the fact is that the odds are six to five on winning and three to one on a knockout. And that's what it's all about as we approach the moment of truth. [crowd applauding] [bell ringing] - Ladies and gentlemen! [crowd cheering] 15 rounds of boxing for the Heavyweight Championship of the World! In this corner, wearing a white belt, weighing at 195 pounds, from Sydney, Australia, the challenger, Matilda! [crowd cheering] - I love that animal. The perfect fighting machine. - And in the opposite corner, wearing green velvet trunks, weighing in at 201 pounds, from Coldwater, Mississippi! The Heavyweight Champion of the World! [crowd booing] Dockerty! [bell ringing] The referee, George Latke. [applauding] - Now let me take a look at your gloves. Keep your punches up at all times. Now I don't want any kidney punches and I don't want any rapid punches, is that clear? Now, does he understand all this? - Oh, yes, yes. He's been train according to the mark of the Queen's boxers. Just tap him on the shoulder, he'll break. He's got ring manners. - He really does understand? - Yes, sir. - All right, okay. Shake hands now, come out fighting. [crowd cheering] - [John] Waiting now for the greatest moment in Heavyweight Championship history, Matilda the fighting, boxing kangaroo. Lee Dockerty is the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Here's Matilda, ready to come out to battle. Our battle instructions for the champion. [crowd cheering] Ready for the bell for round one. [bell ringing] There's the bell! [crowd cheering] Matilda bounds out there. The champion waits for him, sticks out his left hand, it's short! Another one is short! Apparently, Matilda's a fine boxer and a good hitter. The champion misses over the head, takes a right to the jaw and back. Both hands to the body by Matilda. Matilda fakes the left hand. Drives another left, it's wide over the mark. The champion is short. He's not landed a punch yet. The champion tries another left hand and misses. And he ducks away. Misses a left hand over the head, is driven back by a right to the jaw by Matilda. The challenger is in control of the fight here in round one. [crowd booing] - Get off his feet! Break! - [John] The referee, George Latke, gets them apart. At long range again. Matilda bounds in, the champion steps away, almost trips over Matilda's feet. But he does not go down! A left in the head by the champion, he takes a counter in right in the left of the jaw, thrown by Matilda! The champion is strong on the left. [crowd cheering] The champion may be out, I don't know. The referee is counting numbers. He has two outs and he's trying to get up now as the crowd reaches six, seven, eight. He is up at the count of eight and the referee wipes off his gloves. - You can do it, come on, champ! - [John] In real trouble! This is amazing tonight, folks! The challenger bounds in. Matilda comes at him. The champion is stalling for time. He's combing around the ring. And he comes back with a left. [crowd cheering] - One. Two. Three. [bell ringing] - [John] And that's the bell! - God, that second punch! Dockerty doesn't even know where he is. It might be over. - [John] The bell has saved the champion. [Matilda whimpering] A beaten champion gets back to his corner. His helpers are worried and working over it. - Keep it with you. Stay away from him, even to box him! - You're doing fine. They're gonna keep it going. - Remember that! Box him! - [John] The fighting kangaroo, Matilda! [crowd cheering] They're a very happy group in Matilda's corner. [bell ringing] We're ready now. Dockerty comes out for round two. [crowd cheering] The champion bicycles a little bit. Moves away from the challenger. The challenger just stands there. Watch the punch, watch another one. [crowd cheering] Matilda blocks another left hand, thrown by the champion. He still hasn't landed. Matilda in with a left hand to the body. - Come on, champ! - [John] He's wild with his left hand! Matilda is a fine defensive boxer. He drives a left and right to the jaw. [crowd cheering] Again, the champion is driven under the ropes. He bounds off and Matilda throws him down to the canvas. And he referee has him get up, this time without a count. The champion trips over Matilda's feet. Matilda on him again. A jab, a left and a right to the jaw! And the champion is driven out of the ring. He rose up off the ring! The champion out of the ring! They're very happy in Matilda's corner. Matilda waiting for the champ to get back in. The champion is trying to get back in. He does beat the count. [bell ringing] And there's the bell. [crowd applauding] [Matilda cooing] The kangaroo back in his corner and there's the champion, Lee Dockery. - You're doing great, they love you. - Let me talk to him! All right, take it easy. - Well, Dockerty's accomplished one thing. - What? - He made it to round three. No other opponent's ever done that. - [John] The first round took so much out of him. The referee goes over and asks him how he is. He is not in good shape but he is game and he is going to keep on fighting. [bell ringing] And there's the bell for round three! The kangaroo is across the ring so fast! Dockerty isn't even out of his corner! He's caught by a right to the jaw! And the referee is counting over him again. Dockerty on one knee is taking the count. He's back on his feet and ready to fight. And Matilda comes at him. Dockerty misses a left and a right. He's trying hard but he's not landing any punches. He takes another right to the jaw. [crowd cheering] He almost goes out of the ring but he does not. The ropes hold him up. He grabs hold of Matilda to keep from going down. Dockerty is wobbly in there. He's on very rubbery feet. He moves to the left and Matilda comes up behind him and drives the right hand to the head! Matilda moves away from Dockerty again. Dockerty is reeling around the ring. He is in bad shape! If he were not a Heavyweight Champion, it probably would stop him! Matilda is on him again, reigning punches to the body! And then to the head. This kangaroo can fight! He messes him up good. A good jab! Two more, three more jabs to the chest! [booing] Wobbly Dockerty fires a meaningless left hand and he goes down again. But he bounds up quickly and the referee goes around them. - What is keeping him up? - [John] Dockerty misses a left. Counter to the left, right to the head. A left hand to the body by Matilda! Dockerty is taking an awful beating in there! He still has not landed a punch and we're near the end of round three! Dockerty is battered, puts both hands to the body and none to the head as Matilda give him no rest. The champion is taking a terrible beating. A left hook to the jaw! [thudding] [crowd cheering] Dockerty is down again! I don't know if he's going to make it. Matilda bounds across him! The referee is counting over the champion. - Four! Five! Six! - [John] Seven. He's trying to get up, eight! Nine. [bell ringing] And the bell saves him again. Dockerty's back in his corner. He has taken some beating tonight. There's the doctor! - It's all over. He can't come out from the fourth. I'm almost sorry. - [John] Dockerty won't let them! He wants to go on! He has fought courageously! He still wants to fight. - How are you, champ? - [John] Lee Dockerty, and believe it or not, something definite has happened here. I don't believe it. The crowd started rooting for Matilda at the start of the fight. They have now changed. [crowd applauding] [bell ringing] - [John] There's the bell for round four of the most amazing Heavyweight Championship fight in all history! And the crowd is now for the champion, believe it or not. But he is still taking punishment in there. Punches all over to the body, to the head. Matilda bangs and staggers him again. I don't even know what's hold the champion up. He is reeling around the ring. I don't think he knows where he is. The crowd is now with him because of game. He is a gallant fighter in there. He just will not quit. He is a true champion, win or lose, tonight! But he takes two, three, four more jabs to the chin and still he has not landed a punch. A pounding right to the jaw by Matilda. He is staggered back into the ropes. The champion is wobbly in there. His legs are rubbery! Matilda can't figure him out. The champion goes in and holds on. Dockerty is still holding on. The challenger is lifted! [thudding] [crowd gasping] - Matilda's been hit! - [John] And the challenger is hurt! That's the first time he's been hit tonight. The tide is turned. The challenger is hurt! [whimpering] Matilda stands there. The champion stands there. Nobody seems to know what is happening. This is amazing! - The referee waves the champion in. He's moving in on Matilda. But wait! [crowd cheering] The challenger throws in the towel! The fight is over. [whimpering] Lee Dockerty is still the heavyweight champion! - I don't believe it. [crowd cheering] - Bernie! Bernie! I love you! [Matilda cooing] - [Al] I don't understand it, Duke. First they cheering their heads off for Matilda and then they want him to lose. - [Duke] Well, sure, they loved Matilda up to a point. Then they saw themselves in that ring, the human race. Suddenly they felt threatened. Man doesn't just survive, Al, he's got to prevail. [Matilda cooing] [upbeat marching band music] [crowd applauding] - It was like a dream, it was, with everyone having a happy ending, so to speak Bernie is now Dockerty's manger and you won't believe this. The Pinky is his assistant. [somber music] Bernie married Kathleen and he's very successful. Bought her a beautiful house and four gorgeous kids. Mr. Parkhurst, he got every award they could give him and he's now managing editor of a newspaper. [somber music] Tanya is singing regularly in Las Vegas now when she's not see Dockerty. Oh, Gordon, he's the vice president with the William Morris Agency in Los Angeles. [pleasant music] Matilda's living with Uncle Nono and his family. Uncle Nono retired and bought a small country in Central America where he's now raising kangaroos. And I know they're very, very happy. [pleasant music] They were the nicest people in the world. That's exactly the way it happened. It's the truth. I've got to go and do something. Don't go away. I'll be back in a minute. Come along, Junior. Up you go. Uncle Bernie will be along in a minute. [pleasant music] - [Girl] I wanna hold Junior! - No, I wanna hold him! - I wanna touch him! - He's had his milk and his candy bar. Children, today's a very, very special treat because I love you all, today you can give him his candy bar. - Good, we'll have him back in a couple of hours. After we drop off this kids. - We going to have lunch? - Well, if I get out of the gym in time. - [Girl] Are you taking Junior to the gym again? - Okay, everybody into the car. - Honey! - Go on, will you? - [Kathleen] Bernie, it's inhuman to do that to a baby kangaroo! It's inhuman! - Did anybody ever tell you that you're always repeating yourself? This is not just any kangaroo. Junior's different. Remember who his father was. Bye, Billy! Bye! - [Kids] Bye! - Bye, Billy, we love you! - Bye, Billy! We love you, Billy! [pleasant music] ["When I'm with You, I'm Feelin' Good" by Carol Connors] - Life's grand.
