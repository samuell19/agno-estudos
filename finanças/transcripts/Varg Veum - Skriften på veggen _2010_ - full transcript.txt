THE WRlTlNG ON THE WALL Six years later Hey. Do you want some coffee? I'll make room in the closet. Don't worry about that now. We're looking at a house at Fagerli and ...? Sydneshaugen. I'm really excited. Come here. It becomes me. Have l managed to tame you? Haven't you? Hello. I'm here to introduce you to the harsh facts of life. Although it's probably too late. Today, however, will just serve as a reminder of how bad I am with names. -Were you a private detective? -Private investigator. What? Like Mickey Mouse with a magnifying glass, - - frowning as you see mischief brewing. ls it like that? How much did you drink last night? Your eyes are glassy and you smell. Your moped has a dent. Happened on the way? -lt's from Saturday. -OK. If you say so. I have some books for you. Were you fired from child welfare services before becoming a detective? What did you do? Are you supposed to be here? Hand out these for me. Torunn? Torunn? Torild. You look a lot like your sister, Eva Beate. You should see me naked. -What? -Naked. I just wanted to ask how you were doing. Take one copy each ... One copy each. Torild? Hello, mom. Here you go. -Do you like it? -lt's nice. Good. Let's go. -We're going to the graveyard. -l've already been there today. You're not coming then? Ok, suit yourself. Perhaps l can hold on to the jacket, while you're doing other things. -Eva! -Please pull yourself together. It was six years ago. We can't do this every time. Hello. Welcome to Sydneshaugen. Stop picking! Behave yourself. It is nice, isn't it? -That's nice. -Yes. -So you're Danish? -Yes. From Copenhagen. I've lived here for 8 years. It's a fantastic house. I have never lived in a house before. It should be interesting. It's been a long time. A really long time. We were just talking about how great this house is. It seems like a place to settle down. It's important to settle down in order to leave the past behind. If that's what you want. How do you two know each other? -Eh ... lt was a long time ago. -l'm sorry? We got to know each other through a bizarre episode with a mutual friend. I've written a book about it. You should have a copy, since you're in it. -So you've become an author? -Obviously. -lt's been a pleasure. -Likewise. Good luck. I thought you preferred younger girls. What was that all about? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. What do you think? Should we put down our names? -Where does this come from? -From a book store. -This is not for you. -Why not? Do you believe what it says? My God, look here. The Knife is back. That's is not good. Torild? It fits with what Eva Beate wrote in her diary. -Eva Beate didn't have a diary. -Yes, she did. It describes how she dropped out of school, did drugs, - - went to rehab, did heroin. Why are you doing this? -Sidsel! -Who's telling you these lies? Haven't we done everything for you? -Why can't you just tell the truth? -l am telling the truth! I'll be in town in half an hour. l'm just selling some stuff to a Dane. -Let me try another one. -No, not that happy. A bit demanding. I want a revolver, not a pistol. It looks like he is happy now. -Would you rather make a high bid? -No, no. You do the bidding. -Don't get scared. -No. But l have to work late. I'll see you later. OK. See you later. You served six years in prison for homicide. You're Danish. How did you end up in Bergen? I had friend who had a girlfriend from Bergen. She was very cute. So l went here to find a girl and teach kids - - how to do XTC and cocaine. Everyone should enjoy what life has to offer. Even people in Bergen? If l were to play by the rules imposed by society, - - l would feel more imprisoned than l did in jail. So we are the imprisoned ones? I can't say. That's your problem. I'm sorry. You talk about it as a lifestyle. What is it with you and minor girls? Minor girls ... Yes, what about them? That's what l'm asking. So you find it interesting to talk about? What do you think? A 14-year old girl takes an overdose in your hotel room with you present. Rather than helping her, you drag her out into the streets - - and leave her there. -That's a lie. Is it? Like your selling drugs to minors? Did l say that? Read my book. I have. But police reports say that her mother saw you there. She is lying. l served six years for a crime I didn't commit. Read the book and judge for yourself. "Survival of the Misfit" is the title. Thank you for coming. Thanks also to the audience. Somebody fell here. Brandt and someone else. Then they went over here. One of them went down here. Brandt made it up there. Take a look. With fingerprints on it. Two sets? -Self-defence or crime of passion? -l haven't got a clue. What do you reckon? It was ugly, for sure. A judge who goes to the woods to fight ... It wasn't like this when l was young. How did it go? Did we get it? We got it. We got the house on Sydneshaugen? For how much? NOK 50 000 below the estimated market value. NOK 50 000 below market value?! I have to go. Colonialen restaurant at 8 o'clock? Colonialen at 8 o'clock? See you. Those of you who haven't finished may hand in tomorrow. Hey. Torild is busy. Please leave a message after the tone. It's Varg Veum. Can you call me back as soon as possible? Thanks for letting me borrow it. You do remember me? Yes, vaguely. Come on in then. I'm in the middle of something. A lot of niggling, but it gives results. Quite like being a teacher, I guess. Did you know Ulrik Sand is a reformed citizen? -Who? -The Knife. -He's an author now. -l don't read crime fiction. -Too mundane for your taste, I guess. -Yes. I met him looking at a house for sale. No wonder. He has been living in cramped conditions lately. It seems he is looking up people who were involved with his case. -lncluding me. -So that's why you're here. Jumpy? I'm just wondering how reformed he really is. Are you keeping an eye on him? A judge was stabbed with a beer bottle to the neck. I'm more concerned with him. -What judge? -Herman Brandt. Wasn't he the one who sentenced the Knife? Yes, he was. -Shall I dedicate it to someone? -Yes. To Vera. What's this? What's happened to Brandt? I don't know. What is this? If l were you, l'd take it seriously. -Where is Torild? -l don't know where Torild is. It's OK. If you think l've abducted her - - and sent you this note, then l'm sorry to disappoint you. If anything happens to her, I'll break you. You'll break me? Hello? It's Torild. You called me. Where are you? At the Hotel Maritim, room 71 6. Wait for me there. Hey. Are you OK? What's going on? We have to talk. Yes. Do you want me to tell you about Eva Beate? Yes. Please. Can you undress? -What? -Undress. Don't you want to hear about it? I think it's better if I take you home. Then I'll go with you afterwards. Mom has always told me how perfect Eva Beate was. Smart, promising. But she was no angel. And Varg Veum was no knight in shining armour. Varg at child welfare services... Do l look more like her now? Don't do it, Torild. Was it like this? Was this how you did it? Varg! You fucker! Well ... Christ! My dear ... Here you go. What a shame, huh? Varg Veum. Do you know what it means? "Varg Veum". Sacred Wolf. I don't know your parents, - - but they must have been inspired when they thought that up. Sacred Wolf. A creature half man, half animal. Banished after committing a serious crime. An outlaw. Anyone can hunt him down or kill him without any cost. You have no idea what l'm talking about? But you will. I'm going to show the world who you are, Varg. Come on, Torild. I waited two hours for you! Why didn't you call? Hello? Just go. Believe me. It's a set-up. Go! Get out! First l went to your house. I met some students. Their eyes were glassy. They were startled. Tenants. I'm living with my girlfriend Karin. That seems to be working well. -Can l help you? -Yes, you can. Have you seen Torild Skagest√∏l lately? No. Why? Her father reported her missing. She called to say she wasn't coming home. According to this she only has four days left to live. -What is that? -A bad joke. Was that why you were so anxious yesterday? Juvenile stuff. It's not for me. Wasn't it nice how Torild playes the part? 1 5-year olds will do anything. She thinks I've saved her from her evil family. I don't understand. I didn't kill Eva Beate. And you're going to prove it. I see. Well l'm afraid that's not possible. Then Torild dies in four days. Believe me. Do you hear me? Call me if anything turns up. Torild has four days left to live and she doesn't even know it. The beauty of innocence ... Find the evidence and l'll let her go. Check it out! What a view! Awesome! It starts over there. Then it goes over here and all the way down there. I guess there is no other way. Hello. Do you need help? Celine? Can you carry the bags in for Daddy? Celine? -Who are you? -Varg Veum. Private investigator. Celine, come here. It's about Herman Brandt. He was your father, right? My condolences. I'm trying to get mom to eat. She's not eating. I'm sorry to disturb you ... Do you know if this man contacted your father? I remember him from a trial a couple of years ago. Haven't seen him since. -Can l ask her? -l'll do it. No. You've reached the voicemail of Karin. Please leave a message ... "l don't know if l can take it anymore." "l hate rehab and l hate being at home." "l'm going mad." "But when l'm with Varg from child welfare it's different." "He lets me be who I am." "l wish we were the only two people in the world." "There is something more between us." "I can feel it." "If it hadn't been for Varg, l would probably kill myself." What's going on? I've kept an eye on you for two hours. Get to work. I'm not working for you. Unbelievable! What are you up to? I'm sending some photos. How can you be innocent? Eva Beate's mother saw you. Did she? Funny. l didn't see her. You can start with her. Time is running out. A mother and a father who misses their daughter ... What will they say if they see this? Remember to be discrete. Don't say anything to anyone. Or you risk losing more than Karin. Believe me. Hi, Holger. Is Sidsel at home? Is this about Torild? Varg! How nice to see you! -You're looking good. -Thanks. You too. You're concerned about Torild. Don't be. It's going to work out. -Probably, yes. -She is reported missing. She is what? I've reported her missing. -"How is it going?" -"With what?" "You. Yes, you." "Not Eva Beate? You killed her, you bastard!" -"That's not true." -"lsn't it?" -"Listen to me. I know everything." -"What do you mean?" Yes? Hello? Don't touch me! What are you doing? Please come! I'm at the mall. Sidsel? You've reached the voicemail of Sidsel Skagest√∏l. I'm sorry! She called you. Was it long before this? About 20 minutes. No surveillance cameras, three exits. Was it premeditated? You tell me. I don't know. -Did she call anyone else? -l don't know. You have to find her phone here somewhere. We'll find it. Take this one. I'll take these. Do you love me? -l love you. -Then kiss me. -Hello? -Hi Karin. It's me. Please let me in. Let's talk about this. Karin? Do you remember the author we met looking at the house? He served six years for murdering a client of mine, Eva Beate Skagest√∏l. She OD'd. Now he's out, claims he's innocent and wants me to prove it. Karin? Yes? This guy courted Eva Beate's sister from prison. They started chatting two years ago. I don't want to listen to this. I didn't want this to resurrect. Those pictures ... He's just trying to destroy us. Karin? Do you have milk? Then I won't have any. What do you want to know? l was at a party from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. With 20 people. I can give you phone numbers. Two people get killed, one is missing and you know all of them. Who's missing? I'm sure you know who l'm talking about. No, I don't. That's why I'm asking. Torild Skagest√∏l. She was last seen with you at the book interview. So l was seen with her in a place with 400 people. Do you know how many people l talked to? Herman Brandt sentenced you, right? Yes. And we all know he was killed at the time of my book interview. Who says she was seen with me? -That's unimportant. -ls it? Yes. So once again the Bergen police gets the help of Varg Veum? So you have no idea why all this is happening to these people right now? Think of all the unsolved cases you'd have without Varg Veum. As long as they're solved, I don't care. You trust him blindly? Do you know what l trust blindly? Evidence. And he seems to stumble upon them. That's all. But there is no evidence in this case. I couldn't have killed Sidsel Skagest√∏l or Herman Brandt. My supposed connection to Torild is far-fetched. Explain it to me. You should check these things before bringing me in. Would l be sitting here if it hadn't been for Varg Veum? You smoke. Here you go. Great. Why ...? Hamre! Yes? -Nothing? -Not a damn thing. Other people could do it for him. He has a motive! Speculation is your field. l have no evidence. We must let him go. -Why is he doing it? -Doing what? l have no proof. Two people are dead! Torild Skagest√∏l is probably next in three days. -He's going to kill her, then? -Yes. Yes! The only reason we are going after the Knife, is because you insist. So what's going on? What's really going on? Hey! Don't hang around here. Go to class! There he is, Veum! Way to go, Veum! Show her who's the boss. Hello, Varg. The outlaw. How does it feel? Not very nice, eh? You have nothing. You've released the pictures. You're bluffing about Torild. -Am l? -You have nothing. You're bluffing. There is one bullet in the revolver. 1 out of 6. Try me. Am I bluffing? You're not bluffing. -Promise you'll solve the case. -l promise to solve the case! -Nothing? -No. Where have you been? In the corner over there. Sit down here. Take his handcuffs off. Can l have a glass of water? Tell me all about it. About what? We have pictures of you having sex with a missing minor girl. You were there when her mother was killed. The mobile you said we would find has disappeared. You had this at your office. Now we found it in Sidsel Skagest√∏l's coat - - which also places her at the scene of Brandt's murder. -Did Sidsel Skagest√∏l kill Brandt? -Yes. Stabbed him to the neck. She called Brandt endlessly before Torild disappeared. She wanted to get rid of the Knife. Why? Stop thinking that you're working on this case. You are this case. Am l a suspect? Where were you at the time of the murder? What are you hiding? Soon it will be only 24 hours left. Killed - Police without leads What are you doing? Listen. Listen to me, honey. -l just wanted her to ... -What? I don't know Go ahead. If you want to leave, then leave. But you're not going to find anything. I know what it's like to be alone. It's no fun. But l am here. You are very close to finding freedom. With me. I have to place you in custody. Can l make a phone call? To my girlfriend. All right. Let go of me! I want to know what you're doing to find Torild! Hey! Is that him? -Where is Torild? -Take it easy. -Calm down! -l've seen the pictures! Fucking pervert! l'm going to find you! You're not getting away! Who has a card? Hey! I have to borrow this car! Guys, l have a question for you: The other night, did any of you find a mobile phone and decide to keep it? -Did you? -Maybe. All right. -How much is a mobile phone? -NOK 300. Let me see it. Hello. I have a mobile number here. 95463571 . Can you tell me who the subscriber is? Thank you. Hello. Is your son here? Yes. Come on in. Come on, Celine, just one more bite. I have Sidsel's mobile. She called you before she was killed. Come with Daddy. Let's go out. What did Sidsel say? What did she do? Stian, think about her. Stian, think about your daughter! Will you help me? -Will it help if l talk? -lt helps, yes. Eva Beate had run away from rehab. I was madly in love with her. I was 1 7 and crazy for her. I would have done anything. Anyway ... She wanted me to help her. She didn't dare to inject herself. I pretended to know what l was doing. Then she passed out. And then she was gone. I was freaked out. I called my dad. Then Sidsel came and found us there. When Daddy came, he pushed her to go after the Knife. Punishing Stian will not bring your daughter back. We have to go after the guy behind this, so it won't happen again. They moved her. They moved her to the street where the Knife lived, where you found her. -What about the Knife? -l just bought the drugs from him. Dad made Sidsel give a false testimony. He ruled in the case, - - so l was acquitted. Now Sidsel wanted me to say that l saw the Knife kill dad. So that he would be gone again. I refused. She started blackmailing me, threatening me. She threatened to tell everything to the police and destroy me. I just tried to make her stop. Don't pressure me! I just tried to make her stop. Where did Eva Beate die? -What about the Knife? -I just bought the drugs from him. -l have what you need. -Good. Isn't it good for you too? Can't we just get this over with? Go to Hjellestad, to the last house by the water. Come alone. ls that clear? Don't say a word to anyone! You have one hour. Torild ... Where is Torild? What have you done to her? I'll ask you one last time: -Do you know where Torild is? -Yes, I know. Where is she? -l can' say. -Why not? I have to do it alone. Do you think l believe that?! I'm not stupid! -Tell me where Torild is! -l can't. There is a guy who needs help. Around the curve. It's about time! What the hell are you thinking? Torild? What will happen now? I want to go now. What happens now, Torild? Torild Skagest√∏l as we know her is dead. This is the new Torild. She is happy. And she is mine. Take care. I'll be seeing you, Varg. One out of six! One bullet in the revolver. Would you dare, the Knife? One out of six ... And you let her go. Can we go now? It was my fault. Your entire life was my fault. One out of six ... All right. Pull the trigger three times, and l'll let her go. -Can't we just go? -Just a second. -Stop it! -Wait over there! Are you sure you want to do this? -You're bluffing. -Am l? Am l bluffing, Ulrik? I killed your sister. Eva Beate fell for me. I didn't try to stop it. She was a child. And I was an adult. It was like a drug. It was something I wanted. But when she really needed me, I failed her. Don't do it. Please! You're right. Sometimes it feels so good to do someth... Torild? Torild! Torild! Torild, come here! You're going to pay for this. I can't hear anything. Nothing. I'm sorry. Wrongfully convicted It's none of my business but I'm curious: How do you solve a case by shooting yourself in the head? I have to switch locks. Yes. Tell me if I've got this right. Mrs Skagest√∏l wants to renew a contract to remove the Knife. The judge says no and the missus loses her temper. She wants Stian Brandt to do the same for her. The Knife is busted and she is cut loose. ls that right? Stian Brandt kills his father's murderer without even knowing it. I've heard worse. How many are you going to save before you can forgive yourself? Hey.
