Use a brush like this and go back and forth, back and forth with a twist. And that's it. That's your Mexican style ribs. You're gonna love it. ROBERT: Doris, what's for dinner? DORIS: How about leftovers? Oh, no, not leftovers again. You're killing me. Well, I could defrost something. Liver? This stuff's been in there long enough to start its own ice age. Fine. Then let's go out. Now you're talking. I feel like Italian. You know, lately, it's made me gassy. How about Chinese? I'd rather have Thai. Whoa. Can we help? Well, my alternator's out. Can I get a ride? It'd be our pleasure. Really? You sure it's no trouble? Like I always say, lend a hand, get a hand. Well, thanks. You saved my life. My name's Steve. It's nice to meet you, Steve. Let me go get my things. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Where are you folks headed? To the food court. There's always something to eat there. Well, not now. You take me home and the steaks are on me. Oh, we wouldn't dream of it. It's such an imposition. Are you kidding? I mean it's the least I can do for you folks helping me out. Take your next left up here. (STEAK SIZZLES) Like this? Back and forth, back and forth with a twist. You got it, Steve. Oh, don't overcook those. Robert likes his meat still bleeding on the plate. (MEN LAUGH) Steven, I hope you don't mind. I found your wire rack. No, not at all. I'd like to make a toast. To a couple of lifesavers. ROBERT: And a great dinner. Robert, is that all you think about? A guy's gotta eat. I need to get something inside. Robert, can you watch the grill? It'd be my pleasure. STEVE: Thanks. (OMINOUS MUSIC) DORIS: Robert, get in here. (STEVE MUMBLES) ROBERT: Doris, he's awake. Shit!

Though I have put many miles between myself and the sea, I fear that aquatic menace has again come for me. Should this be my final night, then let this journal serve as a record of that wretched beast, the octopus man. GILL: It's a bit melancholy, wouldn't you say? Noted. You'll be shocked to learn, Gill, I didn't bring you along for your keen editorial eye. GILL: Noted. And why have you brought me along? You're a comfort object. Comfort me. GILL: Shall I fetch some warm milk and read you a bedtime story? Or you can keep your mouth shut and let me write. GILL: A bedtime story of your own? It's my last one. Tonight, he dies or I die. GILL: And how do you plan on killing him? I'm gonna cut off his tentacles. GILL: Before he cuts off yours. No games tonight, Gill. GILL: Only bedtime stories? Once upon a time.

Tell me. What kind of hospital is this? Calm down. It's okay. Why can't you just tell me who I am and why I'm here? You just need to calm down, okay? You have to remember on your own. What's that? It'll help you sleep. I don't wanna sleep. I wanna know where I am and what's going on. We hope in sleep, in dreams, you'll regain some of your memories.

Yeah, we'll stop correcting you when you learn to spell. GROUP: Than. Than, you will pay. No, spirit, it's T-H-E-N. E! Yeah, then is a conjunction. You would use then in this situation because, because you're not connecting two sentences together. I'm not someone who you should mock. It's whom. SPIRIT: What? It's actually whom. I'm not someone you whom you should mock! Who is a subject pronoun! You chose the wrong demon to mess with. Never end a sentence with a preposition. Can you believe this? Horrifying.

Yeah, and if one of those reasons happens to snap a pic of Father Lance with his hand down some IHOP waitress's skirt, we're done. It's over. Drew, that's offensive. I'm a Denny's man. Would you watch it? That's our lifeline. What is your deal today? I think he's just trying to say you should show more respect for technology. Who the fuck is that guy? Braden, sound. What happened to Chris? He's under the weather, asked me to fill in. Okay, well, just don't get your boom in my shot, and make sure you sign an NDA form. Wow! Forgive me, Lord, I have sinned.

Okay, in three, two, one. LANCE VOICEOVER: I cast you out in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. You are at the mercy of the creator. (WOMAN SCREAMS) Welcome to The Cleansing Hour. I am Father Lance, your guide through these troubling times. Tonight, we bring you Sabrina, an innocent soul tortured by the only family she'd ever known. Molested by her father, beaten by her mother, Sabrina sought escape from her unimaginable pain in the form of drugs, alcohol, and ultimately, prostitution. WOMAN: I will not (mumbles) Shh! Wow. Well, anyway, so it's Josh and Kyle. The enemy of God exploited her frailty and took control of her body. But tonight, by the grace of God, with my help and your prayers, Sabrina will be rid of this evil. Okay, that's great, Heather. Just keep your head down. Whatever they can't see will terrify them. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. DREW: Right, great, Heather. Now try and bite him. Sabrina is exhibiting incredible strength and aggression. This could be a stage four possession. I command you, unclean spirit, by the mysteries of the incarnation, passion, the resurrection, and the ascension of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you tell me our name and obey me to the letter. Speak your name, demon. Okay, Heather, your demon name is Slubgob. Repeat, Slubgob. Your name, demon. Speak! Damn, Heather, very nice. Tell me your name in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ! We are Thoth, collector of fractured souls. Soon, we'll be thousands in number, limitless in strength. Just go with it. She said her name was Thoth. Heather, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but please stick to the script. LANCE: Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come... What on earth are you two watching? Thoth, a foreign slime of hell, servant of Satan, see the cross of the Lord Jesus and submit to the authority of the almighty. Fight, Sabrina, fight! Do not give in! Fight! That wasn't me. It must have slipped. Fuck you, deceiver. Fuck you in front of the masses. You worship the world and the bounty of the vice. You're nothing but a pawn in the eyes of the great one. Silence! Silence, demon! I cast you out in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Be gone and depart from Sabrina who is but an innocent creature of God, for it is he who commands you, he who flung you from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell!. What the fuck? Is that you? Harken therefore and tremble in fear for you are at the mercy of the creator of all things. Submit and depart from us! (THOTH GROWLS) Oh, shit. Heather? We've got a problem. Something's wrong. Heather? I don't think she's acting. I gotta end transmission. Don't you dare. Look at the numbers. Help me, Father Lance, please! We gotta fix this. Don't break the fourth wall. 13 million people are gonna watch this girl die. Who do you think they're gonna blame? Help, me, Father Lance. Give me the book. I'm the exorcist, right? Read it out loud. Yeah. THOTH: (laughs) Help me, Father Lance. (THOTH LAUGHS) Repel, repel, oh Lord, the devil's power. Break asunder his snares and traps. Put the unholy tempter to flight. I cast you out, demon! Be gone, be gone, be gone. Depart from us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Be gone! (HEATHER SCREAMS) Sabrina, are you with us? Sabrina? Sabrina, are you with us? Sabrina? Sabrina, are you, are you with us? Are you with us? (LANCE GRUNTS) Get her off me! Drew, help! DREW: I'll get her legs. I'll get her legs. LANCE: What the fuck! DREW: I got her legs. I got her legs. LANCE: What the fuck! What happened? Did I do the job? You did good, Heather. You did good. I did it. I fuckin' did it. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GUNSHOT BLASTS)
