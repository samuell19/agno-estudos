What can you do on your own? What about your mother? I've been trying to figure out what can I do? My mom is my own responsibility We're neither sick nor disabled Why should we lean for support rely on someone all the way in my life? Why have you changed so much so suddenly? You wanna stand on your own feet, go ahead I won't help you, okay? Why do you have to leave? Are you going to be with that boy? You know he's the one who sold the story? He wouldn't do that How do you know he wouldn't? How long have you known him?

I jog every day If I keep jogging like this I'll be able to run a marathon Do you...miss her? Let him make the decision You two are so sweet I'd like to have rice noodles and pork cheek Behind any idea that indicates separation Iies a great crisis Once what's good and bad is defined there will be conflicts...and wars If the world ended tomorrow what would be the most important thing to you? This is the baby's heartbeat. Can you hear it? It's faster than the mother's about 120 to 140 bpm Let's measure the baby's head Do you see the white line on the screen? Yes I...

This courtyard house is reserved for a very important client We can't sell it to you Who is more important than me? Hey, we're heading over Hmm Thanks There are many people here How's Yijia doing? Okay, I guess What's your plan? This is what I'm here for I hate going to weddings I won't be there Yijia and I are both very certain that we are just the child's parents We won't be together Because she's not the one I love If we force ourselves together pretending to love each other it'll be a great tragedy What about the future? I don't know what's going happen I do know I'll do my best to raise my kid Besides, her dad said as long as I love the child as long as I love it'll be enough Yijia's mom asked me to pay her 5000 dollars every month She calls it "the price tag of love" I want to see your work Uncle Lu Have you seen Ni? She's in there If you have any thoughts about the wedding feel free to let me know Zoe Fang How's your mother doing? An auntie who owns a bar in Japan asked her to go there to help She's gone That's good What about you? Are you with the... Which one? We're not in touch Why not? I guess I'm afraid Of what? I am afraid I'd bring him trouble He might feel pressured I'm afraid I don't know how to love at all and I might hurt him Or I'm afraid a person like me doesn't deserve his love This is too cheesy An old man like me cannot take it You truly love him, don't you? Hey, if you do love him be brave I really wish you'd come back to me I miss you so much that my heart aches But most of all I want you to be happy In fact, I like that boy Because you like him I've seen your face when you were with him That was something I could never give you And yet he did it With him you were a little girl, happy and content Hey, I've finally said it out loud Look It's all here You know I deleted a paragraph "If you would come back" "you would discover" "that I have always been here for you" "I've never left" But then I thought I'd hurt you so badly I had no right to say those words Finally, you don't mind the reading glasses Well, I've got to act my age I can only read words this big now Doudou, Let's blow out the candles No!
