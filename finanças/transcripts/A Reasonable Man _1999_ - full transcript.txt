(talking in foreign language) It's all right, we're okay, we're okay. Let's move your cows off the beat. Let's move, let's round up the cows. (speaks in foreign language) Yeah, the cows let's move them off the stuff. (speaking in foreign language) It's alright. - (speaks in foreign language) Sipo. - Sipo, I'm Sean. (speaks in foreign language) (distant cows mooing) (camera clicks) (intense orchestral music) - You're late. - I'm sorry. - It's not safe driving these roads at night. (intense orchestral music) Not even the mission safe anymore. Tell them what happened Joe. - We had a break- - The bustards came in with sledge hammers and AK47, smashed our fucking safe out of the war. Last week, we had another flare up on faction fighting. Overnight, I lost two months of booking. The fucking place falling apart. - Please let us pay for our trip, Chris. - That's bullshit, I'm not gonna start charging my friends. (car engine squealing) (crickets chirping) (distant indistinct chattering) (distant shouting) (car engine grinding) (woman crying) - What are you doing? - Protecting my guests. What the fuck is going on here? (woman continues crying) (camera clicks) (crickets chirping) - Oh Jesus. (woman crying) - Nobody moves. Amma blow somebody's fucking head off. (coughing) (woman crying) The fucks matter with you people. - (indistinct) the boy alone. (speaking in foreign language) - The fuck you don't know, you gorra a dick baby here. - Come on, Chris this is not cool. - No I'm taking (indistinct). The cops can come and take this up in the morning. - We will take care of this. (speaks in foreign language) - I am the head man. It is my problem. - He's right, let the kid go. - Fuck him, this people are full of shit. (speaks in foreign language) - Mama. - Sean get in and drive. - Mama. - Chris I met this kid on the river this morning. - Drive the truck. - Mama. - Joe we're leaving. Shut the fuck up. (distant woman crying) - Mama, mama, mama. (crickets chirping) (intense orchestral music) (locking the door with keys) (city ambiance siren) (distance door shuts) - Straight. - Come on. (cell phone ringing) - Hello? Yes. (distant birds chirping) Could you hold on a moment? It's a state prosecutor. - You took some photographs. - Yes. - I'd like copies if I may. - I'll send them. - They won't show what actually happened. - The baby's head was split open with a blow from a hatchet and the boy was holding the hatchet. - He was holding a hatchet, yes. - You're a lawyer. - Yes. - A corporate lawyer, right? - That's right. - And you left for England. - Look, we met this kid on the river. He seemed perfectly normal. - How long were you out of the country? - Nine years. - So, you came back to be part of a new democracy then. (crickets chirping) (distant dog barking) (water buzzing) (crickets chirping) - What are you doing? - I just got some dirt in my eye. (birds chirping) (door opens) - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. What are you pleading? - I beg your pardon. - You're representing the herd boy. - Who are you? - Sorry I'm Sean Rain, I made a statement. - Yes, I read your statement. You said you didn't see much. - No, it had already happened. - I'm pleading insanity. - The record will show the prosecution seeks a conviction of murder, with a suggested murder for the killing being to obtain certain body parts, in order to use these in the preparation of magical muti. The defense claims the accused has no recollection of what took place on the night of the killing and has suggested he be sent for observation on the basis that he may be suffering some mental disturbance. If is found to be fit to stand trial, this case will be referred to the "Supreme Court." We're adjourned. (intense orchestral music) - Mrs. Andwenya, he's not insane. (opening and locking the door with keys) Hello Sipo, I'm Sean remember. Sipo Mbombela. - Mbombele sir. - Mbombele. - Yes sir. Solomon (indistinct) at your interpretive services. - Right, thank you Solomon. Ask Sipo if he remembers how his cows nearly killed me. - How his cows nearly killed you? - Just ask him please. (speaking in foreign language) Tell him I'm a lawyer and I'd like to help him. Ask him if that's all right. (speaking in foreign language) - There's no comment. - Then tell him he's charged with the murder of a baby. - Yes sir. (speaking in foreign language) - Tikoloshe. - What does he say? (speaking in foreign language) Wait a second, take it easy. Solomon wait. - This boy must be crazy. - What did he say? - Very bad, no good, evil. - What is evil? - The Tikoloshe has this boy bad. - What does that mean? The Tikoloshe has him. (speaks in foreign language) (crying) Sipo. (continues crying) (speaking in foreign language) (coughing) The Tikoloshe has him, that's all I've got. What does that mean? - I dunno. - But you've handled muti cases before. - Yes, ritual killings which have nothing to do with the Tikoloshe. - 12 cases in three years. - You checked? - Yes I checked. - Then you know what muti murder involves. - The use of human body parts in the making of magical muti. - It's sick. - Is that why you lost every case? - Mr. Rain, I didn't just crawl out of the bush. I qualified 10 years before you did. I was raised an Anglican. The head of the Anglican church of this country is a black man. - Oh for God sake. - And if I needed for the sake of the client to understand the details of the Christian faith, I wouldn't rely on the first white person I'd met. - You were right, beat insanity. - Now wait just a second. - I was wrong, you were right. You should handle the case. - No you asked for the case of I've dealt with the paperwork so you can take over. You said "He didn't think he wasn't insane" and I believed you. Now after one interview, you've changed your mind. Sorry, this is not how things work. You've taken the case, now handle the case. I don't want the case back. (door shuts) (speaking in foreign language) (whistling) - Excuse me? (speaking in foreign language) (whistling) (orchestral music) (camera clicks) How did this happen? - What? - He's a herd boy, you've got him looking like a deranged psychopathic cult figure. Why didn't you tell me. - Tell me what? - Tell me you were selling the prints. - I didn't sell the prints. I sent copies to the prosecutor. They had no right to publish. - I've taken the case. - What? - I've taken Sipo's case. - You're working for Stevenson Crow. - Well I'll quit. - You can't quit, you've only been there six months. - He's a child. - He killed a child. - We don't know that. (speaking in foreign language) - He understands me. He's fit to stand trial. He's just sticking to his story. - And what exactly is his story? - He says "He killed a Tikiloshe," an evil spirit. (crickets chirping) - How can you go from being a witness to being a lawyer? - The prosecution won't want me as a witness. - Why are you doing this? - I think I can help him. - Why? - I don't know. Excuse me. I'm looking for professor McKenzie. - In the case. - Thanks. (intense orchestral music) (birds chirping) - I take it, you're not a superstitious man. - No, no I'm not. - Quite happy to walk under letters. You don't toss a pinch of spilled salt over your shoulder. - Sometimes, probably just out of habit. (laughing) - Probably just a superstitious little habit. You're afraid of a little bad luck. - I read your report on ritual killings. - Oh you did? - Yes, and your book on Bewitchmond. I skimed that, I've only had the case a few days. - Right, tea? - No, thank you. - Take a seat. - Thanks. Professor, you describe the Tikoloshe as a servant of witch doctors. - Witches, not witch doctors. - I see. - Good. - Well, not completely. Not at all really. - You've never been involved in anything like this. - Not exactly, no. - A witch doctor is a doctor in the fight against witches. He or she has the power to cast out evil, to relieve you from suffering, both mental and physical caused by bewitchment. - Meaning bad luck. - Not quite. Where we would say "You have been unlucky," an African might say "You've been bewitched," but bewitched by someone or something. Misfortune occurs as a result of bewitchment. Ancestors are good, witches are bad. Good, evil, gods the devil you see. - What is that? - Is in (indistinct). A familiar born to a witch who's mated with a Tikoloshe. One of my students made it up for me. You shouldn't really touch it. Never know what curses may have been laid upon it. - You describe the Tikoloshe as about NEHI with the face of an old man, the body of a child and a single buttock like a baboon. - Yes, and a penis so long he carries it over his shoulder, like a club. - Yes. - If your woman's frigid, chances are she's been having it off the Tikoloshe. (giggles) - Right? If I needed your help, would you testify for me, as an expert. - Your working pro day on this? - Well, I could try and get you a small fee. - Unfortunately the prosecution got here before you. They think this was a murder for muti. - Well, I don't see how they can prove that. - You must have read the district surgery report. I don't see how you think you have a case. - "Death was caused by a single blow to the head with a sharp heavy object, such as a hatchet." - And? - That's it, that's what it says. - Then turn the page. Again. Down the bottom where it says additional observations. A child's genitals have been removed. - Yes, I see. - Look, I've testified in dozens of these cases. Muti murders are more common than you can imagine. They should be stopped. - Perhaps I need a witch doctor's perspective. - Yes, it's difficult to be objective when you're not at one with the culture. You know witch doctor, do you? - No, but I'll find one. - Try Rachel (indistinct). She's good but you'll need to get there before sunrise. Gets pretty crowded. - Thank you. - I look forward to hearing your defense. (crickets chirping) (upbeat music) (car engine grinding) (upbeat music) (crickets chirping) (door opens) (spits) (rumbling stones) - You think I can help him? - I'd just like you to talk to him. - You think he's cursed? - No. - What about you? - What about me? - You live in Africa. You are white. You're cursed. Take off your shirt. - Look, I just wanted to ask a few questions. - I will answer your questions, but I want to know why you're here. - I'm here as a lawyer. - Take off your shirt. (orchestral music) (speaking in foreign language) (orchestral music) (speaking in foreign language) You have a snake, deep inside you. You've seen something bad. - I saw a boy who had just killed a child. - You've seen much more than that. We must take out the snake. After that, we can seal you. Fed from the hippo. From the snake. From the frog. You drink from this bottle to help with the snake. You come back when you are ready. - What is it? - Muti. - What kind of muti? - Herbs. Just herbs. This oil is for good luck. You wipe it here, and here. - Now will you come with me? (speaking in foreign language) - He says "He's kill Tikoloshe." - What does that mean? - What he says? He believes he's a kill to Tikoloshe. - He killed a child, tell him that. - Maybe the Tikoloshe was inside the child, now it is dead. - The child is dead. - That's what you say. - That is a fact. - As you say. (speaking in foreign language) - What did he say? - " He wants to know why his mother hasn't come to see him." - Tell him I will go back and fetch her. (speaking in foreign language) (crickets chirping) - Sean? - Just a minute. - You all right? - I'm fine. - You never lock the door. - I wasn't feeling great. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm gonna go back to Zululand in the morning. - What's that on your eyebrows? - An oil. - What For? - For good luck. - What do you mean? - It's a witch doctor, all for good luck. You wipe it down. You wipe it here and here. - Where is it? - In the cabinet. (crickets chirping) - I don't want this in here, Sean. - I'll keep it outside. (soft orchestral music) (car engine stops) Thanks for helping me out. - I've got a group coming in. Oh, Joe I can't work out whether he wants to help you or not. - I must go past the church first. - All right, you take him past the mission church first, he doesn't like to miss mass. - Fun. (car engine grinding) - He broke the bread and he gave it to his disciples and he said, "This is my body, take it and eat." And when the meal was ended, he took the cup and he said, "This is my blood that He shade for you, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith. Take this and drink. Do this in remembrance of me." (birds chirping) Body of Christ. - Amen. - Body of Christ. - Amen - Body of Christ. - Amen. - Body of Christ. - Amen. - You worked at the mission. - Yes. For two years before the funds been came less and less. Father James said, "we should not just rely on our ancestors, we should talk to Mary." God can give you a good life forever or he can give you a hell. - Do you believe in the Tikoloshe Joe. - Tikoloshe is like Jesus, never see him. (car engine grinding) (orchestral music) (distant dog barking) (car door closes) - Hello, sir. - You are not welcome here. - We've come to talk about Sipo. - The police have taken that evidence. We have nothing to say. - I'm not with the police, sir. I'm his lawyer. - His lawyer. You take him away and come back here, and say you are his lawyer. - If you remember that night, sir, we were both a little afraid somebody might be shot. - This is where they be baby was kill. - Whose home is this? - Sipo's mothers. This is where the baby were sleeping. When the police came, they said "We shouldn't touch anything." I've moved Sipo's mother to another village. - I'd like to speak to her. - It wasn't her baby. - Whose baby was it? - Her friends. - Well, could I speak to the mother? - The police wanted to arrest her after the killing, have sent her away. - Why? - They believe we kill our children for muti. - You say the baby was asleep over there. - Yes. - In the red blanket. - Yes. - After the killing, when we saw the mother holding the baby, it was wrapped in a blue blanket. - The police took that blanket. - Well, how do you suppose a child that was asleep over there in a red blanket, came to be hacked to death over here in a different blanket. - Maybe they might have just picked up the baby with a different blanket. - Maybe. Pots and pan on the floor, table turned over, that one year old must have put up quite a fight. (speaking in foreign language) - What was that? - "He said that the baby had not even learned out to walk." - Really, and why would he cut off the genital? - The what? - The penis, why would he cut off the child's penis? - It did no such thing. - It's in the district surgeon's report. - It is late. You'll stay here tonight. I'll bring Sipo's mother to you. (crickets chirping) My favorite wife, mother of five of my children. (laughing) (crickets chirping) Good African beer, try it. (cricket chirping) You like it? Otherwise I have a warm Coca-Cola. (laughs) - That's good. (speaking in foreign language) - This is Sipo's mother, Miriam Mbombela. She doesn't speak English very well. - Could you tell her Sipo's been asking for her. (speaking in foreign language) - "But she asked if he said why he did this terrible thing." - "He says only that he killed a Tikoloshe." - He says what? - That he killed a Tikoloshe. - That is bewitched. (indistinct chattering) - Who has Bewitched him? - Perhaps an enemy of ours, I don't know. This has brought us much trouble. - What are you going to do? - The blood will satisfy him. He'll leave us alone. - Who will leave us alone? - The Tikoloshe. (crickets chirping) (sheet bleating) - We should sleep now. My wife has prepared a heart for you. (keychain jingling) (metal rattling) (door closes) (distant indistinct chattering) (owl hooting) (intense orchestral music) (distant crying) - What do you want? (indistinct chattering) - Sean, what are you doing? She came to my hut. - Let her go. - She knows something, who is? - She's the child, she knows nothing. - Then ask her why she came to my hut. - She's not used to work people, you ever hurt her. Now you leave her. - Let her go, Sean. - I'm sorry God, go, go. - Now you live. - I promised Sipo I would take his mother to see him. - Sipo killed a child, his mother will not come. She has paid blood money, your court will never understand. - Well, then you should explain. - There's nothing to explain. The boy is bewitched and you bring us more trouble, now go. - Let us go on foot. - Until you know exactly what happened inside that hut don't be so sure the boy is bewitched. And find out who cut off the genitals. Does he know the little girl? (speaking in foreign language) - No. - Perhaps if he writes, his mother will come. - He cannot write. - You could write for him. - I'll try. - Tell him I am very sorry. (speaking in foreign language) - The accused killed a one year old baby. At the time of the killing, a ceremony was well underway. The prosecution will show that the baby was killed in preparation for further ceremonial rights, I will seek a conviction of murder. - My Lord, Sipo Mbombela is a herd boy. He's from rural Zululand. The defense does not deny that he killed a baby. However, I intend to show it was his sincere belief that he was killing an evil spirit. An evil spirit known throughout Southern Africa as the Tikoloshe. - Mr. Ray and I noted in the papers before me that counseling the preliminary hearing suggested a plea of not guilty on the grounds of insanity. Isn't that what you should be pleading? - My Lord, the accused is fit to stand trial. He is not insane, and he is not a murderer. I believe I can prove that. - Dr. Mateke, you're the district surgeon who examined the body of the victim after the killing. - Yes I am. - What did the autopsy reveal? - Death was caused by a single blow to the head with a sharp heavy object. (speaking in foreign language) - Such as a hatchet. (speaking in foreign language) - Yes. - Yeah. - You say a blow. In fact, the child's head was split almost in two. - Yes, to the bridge of the nose. - To the bridge of the nose. So it must have been a particularly vicious blow. - Objection, the doctor has no way of knowing whether the blow was vicious my Lord. - Mr. Rain, a blow which splits a child's head in two is unlikely to have been delivered gently, continue Mr. Linde. - Thank you my Lord. For the sake of my Learned friend, doctor, would it be true that the blow must have been a particularly powerful, if not a vicious one? - It must have been delivered with some force, yes. - But the autopsy revealed something a little more startling. - Yes. - What was that? - The child's genital had been removed. - The victim was a little boy. - Yes. - And his genitals had been sliced off. (shouts in foreign language) - What does he say? - He's objecting my Lord. - To what? - He does not agree with his witness. - Well, tell him he can't just shout out in court. He'll have his turn to tell us his story. (speaking in foreign language) Mr. Linde. - I have no further questions my Lord. - Mr. Rain. (clears voice) - Doctor, you say the genitals were removed. - Yes. - With a hatchet? - I'm sorry. - Were they removed with the hatchet? - That I cannot say. - You cannot say for sure that they were removed with the same instrument that caused the blow to the head? - Not for sure, no. - The genitals could have been removed with a different instrument. - That I cannot say. - But it is possible. - Yes. - In fact, the genitals may have been removed by someone other than the accused. - Objection, calls for speculation. - Mr. Rain, where is this going? - I don't believe the accused would mutilate a young child my Lord. - You don't believe it. - No my Lord. - But he killed a child. - Yes, I think so. - You think, for god sake man You conceded as much in your plea. You said "The defense does not deny he killed a baby." - He believed it was something else my Lord. - How much cultural experience do you have? - Not much. - Ask the accused whether he accepts his counsel's admission that he killed a baby. (speaking in foreign language) - What's he saying? - He says, "Yes," my Lord. - He said a good deal than that, what exactly did he say? - My Lord he said "He killed a Tikoloshe." - An evil spirit my Lord. - As I have heard of the Tikoloshe. (intense music) - The state calls, Jennifer Rain. When you arrived at the village, Mrs. Rain, the accused was holding a hatchet and there was blood on the blade, correct? - Yes. - And you took photographs of the accused with this hatchet? - Yes, I did. - Why? - Instinct. - You're a professional photographer. - Yes, I am. - My Lord, the photographs are submitted as exhibit A. I believe they speak for themselves. - Thank you, Mr. Linde. (orchestral music) - I have no further questions my Lord. - Mr. Rain. - I have no questions my Lord. (birds chirping) - Is this the hatchet which you took from the accused? - Yes, it is. - And is this the blanket in which the dead baby was wrap? - I believe so, yes. - These are submitted as exhibit B and C my Lord. The blood samples on the blanket match those on the hatchet and both match those of the victim. In short my Lord, Mr. Fanroyan caught the accused red handed. - Objection. - On what basis. - Red handed is a distortion. He was caught with a hatchet, but not in the act of killing. - I don't think that was suggested. - My Lord red handed implies that- - I know it implies. But no doubt given the novelty of your defense, you intend to hype your particular version of events, but I'm quite capable of seeing beyond a little exaggeration. - My Lord I have the right to object. - Yes but not to unnecessarily interrupt. Continue Mr. Linde. - Mr. Fanroyan, how long have you lived with Zulu people? - Eight years. - And are you aware of any motivations in Zulu culture for the killing of young innocent children? - Objection, the witness is not an expert in Zulu culture. - The witness lives with these people. - The witness lives in Zululand. That is not the same as living with Zulu people. - I would like to hear what the witness has to say. - But my Lord it's completely- - You know the rules. - You may answer the question. - I know that which doctors sometimes use pieces from bodies to make up their muties. - By pieces you mean body parts? - Yes. Lips, eyes, genitals. - Objection, the witness has no personal experience of witchcraft my Lord. This is pure speculation. - Mr. Fanroyan, aside from this case, do you have any firsthand experience of witchcraft? - I know what I know. - And how do you know what you know? - I spent eight years with these people, my whole life in this country, I know. - Yes, well I've lived in this country for 70 years now. I didn't know. Objection up held. - Thank you my Lord. - Continue on another line, Mr. Linde. - I have no further questions my Lord. - Your turn, Mr. Rain. - You've never actually seen body parts used to make muti, have you? - It happens. - That wasn't my question, I asked if you'd seen it done. - No. - And you've never seen a child killed for these purposes, have you? You've never seen a child killed to make muti, have you? - No. - No, then just like the prosecution, you've simply assumed that the child was killed for magical, medical reasons. - He chopped up a one year old baby. - By mistake. - By mistake. I caught him with an ax still his hand and I saw a baby with his head split in two pieces. That's one big bloody mistake. - What you saw was the body of a dead child. You did not see the child being killed nor do you know why it was killed. It is possible someone else killed the child and the accused walked out with the hatchet. - Mr. Rain, hold on a minute. You chose to admit that the accused killed the child and to argue that he believed in an evil spiritual, you cannot now suggest that he did not kill the child. - My Lord the witness has been called to establish a killing. - Would you admit to. - Yes to the killing, but not to the way the witness is suggesting it happened. - So he did it, but not with the hatchet. - He did it, but not to make muti. My Lord, I really must object to you constantly questioning my approach. - In my court room, I will question whatever I see fit to question. - I apologize, just give me a chance my Lord. - Very well. - Thank you my Lord. Mr. Fanroyan, you did not see the child being killed did you? - No. - Nor do you know why it was killed? - There was a ceremony going on. A witch doctor was there. There was a dead goat, that's how these things happen. - But you've never seen a ritual killing. - I have now. - All you saw was a dead baby and you overreacted, isn't that true? - I know what you're doing. - You actually have no idea why this child was killed- - Winning here won't make any difference. - I asked you a question. - Don't try to win here because you want some kind of forgiveness. - Answer the question. - That was war, this was peace. Can't you see the difference. - Answer the question (indistinct). - You can't deal with what happened. - I am cross examining you. It is my job to ask whatever questions I choose and you as the bloody will answer them sergeant. - Mr. Rain, unless I have some explanation for this outburst, I shall have you remove from the case. I shall need an apology by the end of this evening. The court is adjourned. - [Prosecutors Lawyer] All rise. - If you can't stand the heat, you get the out of Africa. (orchestral music) - Sean wait, where are you going? - I need to talk to somebody. - What was that all about? - I need the Sangoma to testify that Sipo's beliefs are sincerely held. - I'll come with you. - I'll drop you at home. (orchestral music) - I want to come with you. (car engine starts) - You weren't being caught. - Yes. - Did you drink what I gave you? The muti in the bottle? - No. - Then you still have the snake. - What snake? - Yay, you may watch, but you may not interfere. I otherwise you must go. Do you want to go? - No. - Then don't speak. He is sick, but not dying. I know what must be done, understand. - What is it? - The same muti to help with the snake. - And you will testify for me. - If you still need me, drink. (sighs) Drink it all. (orchestral music) (clears voice) (intense orchestral music) (explosion) (breathing heavily) (gun shots) (breathing heavily) (coughing) (thrumming of helicopter) - Sean, you gotta go now. That fucking chopper won't wait Sean. (distant indistinct chattering) - Stage one. Put it down Sean. It's stage Sean. Put it down, put it down Sean. You better put your self together or you can fight your own way home. Put it down Sean. (gun shot) (screaming) - You believed you're killing a soldier. You will make them understand. (speaking in foreign language) Lie down. - What are you going to do? - Take out the snake. - No. - You know how to do this? - What are you going to cut? - Very little, sit down. (screaming) (vomiting) - I was on active service myself. - I didn't know that my Lord. - At north the desert with Monty. Now's called Paul Weden. That's me on top of the tank there looking about 12. 'Cause that was a water to be proud of. - I'm sure that helps. I was called up for two years when I was 17. At the time, it didn't seem like an option to spend six years in jailed as a conscientious subjector. And after we'd done the two years, they still kept calling us up two months a year, every year for another 12 years. That's what we were obliged to do then. One minute I was in a city law firm, the next minute I was 200 kilometers inside Angola. - But after what happened, you left the country? - Jennifer had a British passport. When we got married, I was allowed to stay in England. - Right? - Well, I accept your apology. (indistinct chattering) - It won't happen again, sir. (shuts door) (birds chirping) (soft orchestral music) (opens door) Jen. (beeps) Have you seen Jennifer? - I just came in to paint. (drum beats) - How long have you been involved in the study of African culture? - 22 Years. - And during this time you've investigated a number of so-called "Muti murders." - 27 Separate incidents, yes. - Perhaps you could give the court an example of one or two of your case histories. - Well, in my last investigation, two men have been accused of a number of killings. The victims had had their tongues lips and genitals removed. - There was something that all the victims had in common, wasn't they? - Yes, all of the victims were children. - And that is significant. - There is a motive for the killing of children in Africa. - What is that? - The sale to a witch doctor of their body parts. - Why specifically children? - Their innocence is important. - And horrific though this practice may be, it is not uncommon. - No, they say some times any strong medicine can change your bad luck. - And the baby in this case may well have been killed as part of the ceremony, aimed at improving the fortunes of its elders. - Objection, calls for speculation my Lord. - Sustain. - No further questions my Lord. - Professor, I have with me one of your early research reports, do you recognize it? - Yes I do. - At page 55, you say, and I quote, "One of the most horrific aspects of muti murders is that the dismembering of the child's genitals is conducted while the victim is still alive. This you say is believed to make the muti more potent. On page 57, you quote a witch doctor is saying, "If a person is dead when parts of his body are removed, the spirit is lost and the muti will lose its magic." - That's right. - But in the present case, the victim was not found to have had any of its body parts removed at the time of the killing. - Objection, we have it on record that the victim's genitals had been removed. - They were removed by the time Dr. Matzeca performed her autopsy, but it was never established the removal took place before the victim was killed. The prosecution has already submitted copies of these photographs taken on the night of the killing. I have merely had a portion of one of the pictures enlarged my Lord. - Professor, what use would the body parts be if the victim was already dead? - No use whatever. - Except perhaps to strengthen the a case against the accused. Lord, Dr. Matzeka performed her autopsy 24 hours after the victim was killed. There was ample time for interference. - Mr. Linde. - We proceed on the basis of the evidence presented to us by the police my Lord. - So the accused didn't mutilate the body but somebody else did. - For the purpose of this child it doesn't matter who did my Lord. What matters is that it wasn't my client? - But he did kill the child. Mr. Rain, you do still concede that the accused killed the child. - Yes my Lord. - Well done, not a muti matter, but a matter nevertheless. - Why are you so keen to convict him? - Why are you so keen to keep this country in the grip of the past? - The past is very much a part of the present. - Oh really, you see I don't care if he thinks all the forces of heaven compelled him to do it. He killed someone's child. What does he say to the mother? - He has to start talking. - He has nothing to say. - The court accepts wasn't killing for muti, but if he goes on the stand and says he killed a Tikoloshe- - That's what he will say. - He has to explain his mistake. He has to tell me exactly what happened inside that hut. - He has told you. - Nonsense, if he still thinks he killed a Tikoloshe, and he can't tell us how he made that mistake. We do not have a case, we have a confession. Now, how did he mistake a child for a ghost? - He has killed Tikoloshe not a ghost. - You killed a baby. (speaking in foreign language) - "He has said so from the beginning." - Well tell him he is not helping me. If he has nothing to say, I can't put him on the stand. - He does not wish to lie. - You believe him? - I believe he's telling the truth. - Father, you are a Roman Catholic priest ordained by the Catholic church. - Yes. - And as a priest, you have performed a number of exorcisms. - Objection, what relevance does exorcism have to this case? - My Lord, the defense of young Sipo centers on a question of faith. - Faith, faith in what? The witness is a Catholic priest, not a witch doctor. - Well a which doctor will be my next witness. - The objection is overruled. - Thank you my Lord. Father, what is the purpose of exorcism? - It is resorted to when the church has firmly established a case of demonic possession. It's purpose is to cast out the demon. - By demon you mean some kind of evil spirit? - Yes. - And how many exorcisms have you been involved in? - Oh, 15 or 16. - And they were all sanctioned by the Catholic church. - Yes, they would have to be. - And is the belief in demonic forces a uniquely Catholic notion? - No, not at all. You will find cases of demonic possession reported in the works of all the great faiths, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, even Buddhism. - Thank you father. No further questions. - Father, you're an intelligent man. You have your faith. You're not seriously suggesting to this court that you believe in fairies and goblins. - Mr. Linde, if I understand this case correctly, that young man believes that evil may take the form of Tikoloshe, and you are trying to imply that he does not. Well, how can you put a man's faith on trial. - When faith results in the death of a child? I think the state has a right to question the faithful form, don't you father? - You may question the actions of the faithful, not the faith itself. - No, I question the faith father. I question a belief in witchcraft because I believe it is evil. - So you believe in evil after all Mr. Linde. - This isn't (indistinct), how long have you been a Sangoma? - I've trained for many years with an older Sangoma. I've been a Sangoma myself for 21 years. - And what does the Sangoma do? - I listen to the voices of the ancestors of my people, and I help when my people are sick. - And you are not afraid of the Tikoloshe. - I know how to deal with Tikoloshe. - What about ordinary people? - Ordinary people are afraid of Tikoloshe. - You've examined Sipo. - Yes, Sipo is a very brave child. - If an ordinary person thought there was a Tikoloshe in his or her house, do you think they might try and kill it? - Most people will run away. - But a really brave person. - A really brave person might try and kill it. Such a person might one day become a Sangoma. - Thank you. No further questions. - Sangoma, what level of education do you have? - I'm sorry? - What sort of official schooling do you have? - Objection, official schooling does not qualify anyone to be a Sangoma. - Officials schooling goes somewhere towards eradicating superstition. - The witnesses called as an "Expert in Superstition," my Lord. - Where I came from in Switzerland, there was only a primary school organized by the church. - You were raised to be Christian. - I was raised by my people. I went to school for a short time. We learned about eating the body of Christ and drinking his blood, it seemed ugly. - I see you prefer goats blood. - To the blood of the lamb? Yes I do. - Right, but you have no professional qualifications. - I am not a professor of Sangoma Mr. Linde. I am a Sangoma. - And you believe in goblins and ghosts. - Objection. - No further questions my Lord. - Mr Rain, I assume you wish me to accept that belief is something dear to many people of many cultures. - Yes, my Lord. - Yes, well I'm sure we all know that to be true. But what I cannot understand is how continually claiming this on behalf of the accused helps to further your case. - My Lord- - One moment. If he says he believed he killed a ghost and he did in reality kill a child. Should you not be claiming a mental delusion of some kind, in which case you should not have dropped your original plea of temporary insanity. - The accused is not insane the Lord. - But you have no other explanation as to what actually happened. - No my Lord. - All you can say is that "He believed he was killing a Tikoloshe. Well, I'm afraid without something more, I cannot accept your defense. I still have mass murderers walking into this court claiming they were inspired by God Almighty Krishna of Alo, heaven knows who? Am I to accept their delusions as well? Do I say that they are neither insane nor culpable merely because of their particular faith. - I really don't know my Lord. - What to put it bluntly. Were the atrocities of Hitler or Stalin or even RN previous government not committed in the name of sincerely held personal beliefs. - Their beliefs may not have been sincerely held my Lord. - Well, assuming that they were, does that excuse what they did? - No my Lord. - No, well, in which case, I hope you've not tied this young man's future to anything as flimsy as his personal faith. (fridge door opens) (clears voice) - Your wife she's very persuasive. It was a policeman from a different claim who cut off the genitals. He wished my people much trouble. - Tandy. Sean, this is Tandy. (water humming) (dor opens) (water humming) - Tandy, is this your brother Sipo. - Tandy, (speaks in foreign language). - She says, "Yes." - Tandy I want you to tell the judge, everything you remember from the night of the accident. (speaking in foreign language) (wood spliting) (distant indistinct chattering) - Tandy, (foreign language). (cricket chirping) (continue speaking in foreign language) (drum beats) (goat beating) (drum beats) (goat beating) (drum beats) (speaking in foreign language) (screaming) - It would seem the Lord that the child pushed the chair and pull the table cloth from the table, in an effort to stand and take its first steps. Exhibit C presented by the prosecution, is not a blanket. It's a table cloth, and it is split in the bloodied area. The baby was covered by the cloth at the time, the accused lashed out. - Surely he knew you that the child was in the hut. - My Lord, I have subpoenaed Mary Majola, the mother of the dead baby. She will testify that she laid her one year old down to sleep in Sipo's mother's hut, because she felt it would be better off away from the coughing of her sick elder daughter. Sipo was out herding cattle, little Tandy was playing with friends. Neither were aware that the baby had been left to sleep in their hut. The defense submits as exhibit E, the blanket in which the baby was wrapped when it was left to sleep. There are no blood stains. The baby crawled away from this blanket, pushed the chair and grabbed table cloth, as it struggled to stand. - But why did he never mentioned that his sister saw the Tikoloshe? - He was protecting her my Lord. I have nothing further. (birds chirping) - My Lord, it is not disputed that an innocent one year old baby was in fact killed by the accused. Having said so I concede that I have seldom heard a more regional defense. What it amounts to however, is this. The accused is afraid of a fictional bogeyman so we should excuse him for killing a baby. It's absurd, creative, but absurd. Nevertheless, if this court accepts the improbable version of events presented by the defense. Then although the charge of murder could be defeated. The charge of culpable homicide still stands. A person is guilty of culpable homicide if he has caused a death in a situation where a reasonable man would not have done so, that is the law. While reasonable people do not believe in goblins and ghosts. They do not lash out with hatchets of Phantoms. These are backward ideas rejected by reasonable people. They are accused, is at the very least, guilty of unreasonable conduct, and hands of negligent killing. - My Lord, murder is the intentional killing of another human being. The accused intended to kill, not a human being, but an evil spirit. Without an intention to kill a fellow human being, this court cannot convict him of murder. As regards to the charge of culpable homicide, it is true that a person will be guilty of a negligent killing, if he or she kills in a situation where a reasonable person would not have done sir. But the prosecution seems to take it for granted, that the beliefs and actions of the accused were unreasonable. Surely this depends upon a definition. A definition of what is reasonable, a definition of a reasonable man. We live in a multicultural society, and the question we must face is this, who in a multicultural society, is a reasonable man. Is he urban or rural? Is he a person of Western education with Judeo-Christian beliefs? Or is he perhaps a person from (indistinct), with a deep faith in his ancestors and a genuine fear that evil may take the form of a Tikoloshe. Sipo had no reason to suspect that his little sister was lying about having seen a Tikoloshe in her heart. Indeed little Tandy was not lying, she two believes. When those pots and pans flew back off the table and crashed to the floor, Sipo lashed out instinctively. He made a terrible mistake, but given his genuinely held beliefs, his mistake was reasonable. This court cannot convict him of either murder or culpable homicide. The defense rests. (soft music) - In the case of the state versus Sipo Mbombela, the judgment of this court is as follows. It is accepted that the accused genuinely believed that he was killing an evil spirit rather than a human being. Given that the crime of murder requires an intention to kill a human being, this court finds the accused not guilty of the crime of murder. As regards the lesser charge of culpable homicide, the question which this case so powerfully raises is whether there is only one kind of reasonable man, or whether in these difficult cases, another type of reasonable man to be conceived of. I have no doubt. And it is the judgment of this court that by the law of this country, there can be only one standard, and therefore only one kind of reasonable man. To hold otherwise would create an untenable situation. If in the present the case, the standard were taken to be an 18 year old from rural Zululand, living at home in his crowd, then in each and every other case, the standard would have to be varied to suit the description of the particular accused. In other words, there would be no standard at all. - That is ridiculous. - I beg your pardon. - I said, "That is ridiculous my Lord." - You are in contempt counsel. I'll see you in my chambers immediately. How old do you think you are? - I apologize my Lord, but the standard you suggest is that of an urban man with a Western education. - I was in the middle of my judgment. - Your judgment is based upon the standards of society with which the accused is completely unfamiliar. - Well then it's high time he adopted a modicum of civilized behavior. - Your job is not to teach civilized behavior at the expense of one individual. - Don't you teach me my job young man. If you think I haven't applied my mind to your arguments, then you insult me. I set a president when I hand down a judgment. Am I to provide a cop out clause for every man who has a maverick belief? The fact is that this boy's beliefs are archaic. - The fact is they are his beliefs. - You took this job because you felt guilty. You wanted to turn, and I'm sorry but that's not the way. - He made a mistake. - He's never admitted you made a mistake. - I believed in a soldier, he believed in a Tikoloshe. - And the next person will believe that he was compelled by God almighty himself. - As did Abraham when he prepared to slaughter his son. - That's a myth. - Many would not agree. - Our legal system is based on rational thought. There is no place for belief in the law. - Your judgment is rooted in a certain belief. - I personally have no belief. - That is a belief. - Oh, you want to debate, right. Now let's suppose that I personally believe in the Tikoloshe and let's say that somebody has told me there's one lurking under my bed. Now, even with this belief, do I draw my gun, storm into the room and far off a dozen rounds into the mattress, without even turning on the light. - There are no lights in the village my Lord. - There might like a candle, fuck sake. - But at least I take some reasonable steps for lashing out with a hatchet. - That is not what you said in your judgment. - Sorry. - In your judgment, you said "His beliefs were unreasonable." Now you were saying his belief may be reasonable, but that even with that belief, he may have behaved unreasonably. That is a very different thing. - Is that so. - Yes it is. You and I saying "That his belief is not per say unreasonable. And I say "That given his beliefs, his reactions were reasonable." - The judgment of this court as follows. The accused is found to have a belief in an evil spirit known as a Tikoloshe. The belief itself cannot be said to be unreasonable. It mitigates in favor of the accused. However, a reasonable man given the beliefs of the accused would still, in the opinion of this court have been more careful before lashing out with a hatchet. The accused is guilty a of culpable homicide. (soft orchestral music) All rise. (soft orchestral music) (door opens and closes) (soft orchestral music) (car engine stops) (soft orchestral music) - Sipo (indistinct). - Mama. (soft orchestral music) - Sipo. - Tandy.
