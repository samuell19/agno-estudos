It's cancer. There's a tumor right here and it appears to be growing. I'm gonna suggest immediate surgery and radiation to help control the growth. We can re-evaluate after six months and see where things are. This is a serious condition and could be fatal, if not treated. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's gonna be okay. Don't you worry now. I know that we're in good hands. We're in good hands, darling... What the hell are we gonna do, Maggie? We're gonna get through this. We always do. She's just a kid. It's not fair. She doesn't deserve this. No, no. Nobody does. She's a woman, Frank. We gotta believe it, these things they... They happen for a reason. But why her? We're gonna get her the best treatment that we can find. And all the support that she's gonna need to beat this. And we're gonna do it together as a team. The best team. It's just that you... you... You need to come to terms with the fact that, well, this is part of her journey. Yeah. I suppose life is like that sometimes, right? We make our own plans and God laughs. Can't change His. I can try. Another bottle of wine? No, no, thanks. I think we've had enough, Sandy. Come on. Let's go home. Save some wine for everybody else. - Just a check. - Sure. Here you go. Y'all have a blessed night. We needed this. With everything going on, I guess something inside in me is telling me that everything is gonna be okay. Hmm. I do love you so. Frank! Right on time as usual, Jenny. Hey, tell your mom she still makes the best barbeque this side of the Mississippi. Thank you, I will. Oh, here. That's for you. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. - Enjoy. - Will do. Thank you. There he is, ready for action. It's nice, Jerry. I appreciate you doing this, Frank. I've had some break-ins in the back warehouse recently and uh, they keep stealing the copper wire. They use it for meth. Oh, those fuckers are ruining our town with that poison. No. You should get your cameras fixed. Ah, well, you're cheaper. I'm just kidding. Let me show you around. There's coffee in the break room. - Mm-hmm. - Snacks. I'll give you 10% off whatever you want in the store, and just... just write it down. Hmm. Oh. Almost forgot I got something for you. - Just come out of pawn. - Mm-hmm. Think of it as ah, welcome gift. Thank you. Do me a favor. Don't them smoke 'em out back. They bitched me for a damn week 'cause of the smell. Well, I'ma close early. I got some errands to do. - I'll see you in the morning. - Alright. - Yeah. - Goodnight. I do love you so. And I love you, too. Frank! I almost got him. Don't you let him get away. Not a fucking chance! I'll meet you. I'm about 40 yards behind. Get the fuck up! Please, no. Shut up! You disloyal fucker! Wha... what! I... You thought we wouldn't find out you're setting up your own place with Luke. You steal our customers and we can't beat that help. You know what that means for us, do you? - It's... - I said shut up! That would mean a death sentence for me and Jake. I worked... worked for you for two years and what do I have to show for it? Fuck off! I want my seat at the table. Oh, you'll have your seat alright, Leon? Right next to Jesus, you fucking Judas! Look, you'd lose half of your distro, if it weren't for me. You need me, you know that! People trust me, Virgil. Well, I don't anymore. You're not leaving me much of a choice. You understand it, don't you? Please, no. He ain't gonna try that shit no more. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Leon's got a gun! He's got a gun. Don't move. Who the fuck are you? You ain't no pig. You didn't need to do this. I've got you in my sights. - It was self defense. - He was on his knees. Here. Take this, and just walk away. This won't end well for you otherwise. Throw your gun. Now! Fine. Go fetch it. On the ground. Face down. It's Frank Richards. Got a 187. At PeeWee's pawnshop. Send backup. Don't move. Fuck. 45 minutes from a Starbucks. Yeah, he likes it a little secluded. It must have been nice growing up out here. Yeah. Feels good to be back. Hm. I can't believe it's been a year since my mom's funeral, you know? My dad could really use the family time. Yeah, of course, he can. It's gonna be good for both of you. - Thank you for coming with, Tam. - Mm-hmm. You really have been so incredible throughout all this. Hey, you know what, like Lana sings it... I'ma ride or die, bitch - Hmm. - Oh, wow. Yes, you are. Hmm. Wow. What is it? I mean you weren't kidding. You really are a bad country girl. Hey, I finally get why you drive a big black truck. Hey, what can I say? - A free car's a free car. - That's right. And my dad only drives big black trucks. So, you're sure? You're sure, you're sure, you're sure? He is going to be okay with me just showing up? - Oh, my God. - He's only expecting you. - We're here a day early. - Hmm. You said he doesn't like surprises. I mean, come on. I feel like we just give him a little call, - a little itsy-bitsy heads-up. - Hmm. You know, he hasn't even met me yet. It's gonna be like, "Hi, Mr. Richards, you don't me know, but I'm gonna be staying in your home for the next week." Come on, it'll be fun. It'll be fun. - And you're my moral support. - Hmm. He gets that. And you know what, if he doesn't, the one thing about having cancer is that people cannot stay mad at you for too long. Hello, sir. I was told you were the man to see. What the hell happened to your face? My fa... Oh, uh, uh, nothing. I just... a little hunting accident is all. Um, I'm here to update your security camera with our latest models. If uh... ...you could show me where your recordings are, I... You're in the wrong place. You must be talking about that bank behind us, we get their mail all the time. Just between you and me, we don't use those anymore. - Are you sure about that? - Yup. We got Frank Richards. Used to be the police captain. He's all the security we need. Could you do me a favor? Give these to Mabel when you go over there. Yeah, I sure will. Uh, my apologies sir. Um, I guess there was some mix-up after all. Um, I'll be sure to get these on over there for you. And sorry again to bother you. Have yourself a pleasant day. Nice young man. Here's your weekly, plus a little... a bonus for that fancy footwork you did last night. Damn shame about that boy. Yeah. I sure am glad you're here though. - Keep up the good work. - Thanks, Jerry. I forgot to mention, and my daughter's coming in... - Oh. - Next week. Ain't that nice. You know, maybe I can come in a little late. - Yeah. - Around 9:00. - Yeah, of course. - Great. Thanks, Jerry. How's she doing? She's fine. Okay. See you. Yeah, bye. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, copy that. On my way in. Send him in. What the hell are you doing here? I... I just thought you might want some company. I... didn't know what you wanted me to do now. Yeah, well, coming here ain't gonna fix what's done. Look, I... I thought he had a gun, okay? - I... I didn't know... - Shut up. I spent half my life looking out for you. Protecting you from the enemies, from yourself. Not to mention that junkie mother of yours. She's the one who made you out to be the way you are. I can't blame you for that. It's just damn ironic how things shake up. They say they got it all on camera. What? No. They're lying. I already done gone over there and I... Oh, um... You remember when I got that handy cam to um, track them deer in the backyard? But uh, forgot to turn the damn thing on. So, there wasn't any damn video. Oh, yeah. That shit is funny as hell. Oh, and then that other time, you saw that deer and went to the shed to get your rifle, but I already took it with me on one of my trips. So there was no damn gun either. You remember? I remember everything. No gun, no video. And you remember all those times you'd do something when yo use was all drunk at night, but blame me the next day, so it was just my word against yours and... Oh, I do. And I always taught you well, didn't I? - That's right. - You sure did. Look at me, son. I'm glad we had this talk. I trust you know the way to righten this, don't you, son? Yes, daddy. I think I do. Well, I guess I done and raised you right after all. Hey? You be clever out there and be swift, you hear? Oh, I will, sir. Count on that. Guard. Speaking of year, are we still waiting on your results? Yup. Man. Look, you know what? I think I'm good. I feel good. - Good. - I'd better be. Between my mom and the radiation and this waiting game, I just... I don't know how much more I can take. Alright. Let's just talk about something else then. Yeah. Like why none of my pictures are posting? - Oh, I didn't tell you? - Mm-mm. Yeah, there is like zero service out here. Once we get up the main road, signal's gone. - You did that on purpose. - Mm, I forgot. Sure. Think of it as a little technology detox. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Just a couple of days. You'll survive. I have faith. You know what? That sounds refreshing anyway. Mm-hmm. So what are we gonna do out here, hmm? - Well, got a couple of lakes. - Hmm. And uh, lots of trails for hiking. Hmm. Um, you know, we have each other, right? Hmm. Sorry, Frank. Technically, this is just a formality, but... you're a civilian now, so uh, this is just protocol. So, Frank, you said that the perpetrator fired at the victim, early in a.m.? That's correct. - But there was no gun. - He had one. Okay. But unless he can throw like Patrick Ma homes, that gun isn't there. What do you want me to say? But right now we got no gun, we got no video, so... - And just my testimony? - Yeah. Hmm. And we got a leg with a bullet in it from your gun, so... it kinda complicates things a little. - Who's the perp? - A Virgil. A Virgil Brown. Member of the Free Birds, local biker gang. Several priors for dealing and several sub charges, but nothing that ever stuck. You know, them boys, they don't hold no expense when it comes to hiring good lawyers. Who is the kid? A one Leon Brakes. A low level dealer. Selling that crap on campus. We're still trying to track the ring leaders as we speak. Good luck with that. Give us a minute. You don't think I can do this job, right? It doesn't matter what I think. Come on, Frank. Don't be like that. It's about experience. Yeah, I get it. And I just don't have enough of it. Is that where you're going with this? It's your show now. Let me know what you need. Alright. We'll see you tomorrow morning at the DA. Okay, Craig. No, I'm sorry. Captain, Captain East. - You ready? - I think so. Yeah. It's gonna be great. Ah, that smell. I'm sleeping with your da... No, nope. Not gonna start that way. I just think you're really sweet. Are you... are you practicing meeting my dad? Hi Mr. Richards. I am nervous. Oh, my God. He doesn't bite. No, but he shoots, right? - Then yes. - No. Not people, well, not most of them. Phew. Oh, wow. I know. Man, he's gotten into shit. It looks like he'd have a little more respect. Even if he was fired. Richter. Now, I know you're new here and you just transferred in. So, I'ma get you up to speed. Now, in a span of one week, his daughter was diagnosed with cancer and his wife was killed in a car crash - with him behind the wheel. - Holy shit. And the final kicker, he blew a few ticks over 0.08 from the drinks that night and got charged with a DUI for the crash. Manslaughter. He beat the charge, because of his track and service record. Of course, he had to step down. Fuck, if I know how someone can bounce back from all that. I sure couldn't. It really is so nice out here. Yeah. My mom loved making this walk in the morning. It's beautiful. It's also really hard. Sorry. Yeah. Why don't we hike, uh, the other side of the lake? Maybe later. You should probably know that um, my dad has traps set out all over the place. Traps for like hunting game? Yeah. And then some. Ooh. What? He's just... He's just being cautious. You know he... I don't know, I think that being Captain for so many years kind of got to his head. You know, he's seen a lot of really bad stuff. Hm. I can only imagine. Hm. He even has a meet-up spot for us out there in case anything ever goes wrong. You know, my dad blames himself for my mom passing. It wasn't his fault. But it eats away at him, you can tell. And then everything that I'm going through, it's just... It's a lot for him to process, you know? And part of me thinks that he needs me to get better more than I do. Hey, don't worry. I'm here now and we are going to cheer him up. You know, I could actually let him show you around. He would love that, you and him in the woods. Uh... Okay. - Okay? - Okay. For sure. In the meantime, let me go unpack the truck. So, we can finally change and you... you go find us some wine. Deal. I'm gonna need it. What is it? Nothing. I'm fine. Mm-mm. Come on, spill it. You know, it's a funny thing, Tam. All I've done is think about death over the last 12 months. You know my cancer, my mom. I cannot even imagine what that feels like inside. I know it's gotta be hard. It was. But now, it's good. What do you mean? It's liberating. How exactly is that? Well, when you think about your own death as much as I have, you stop being afraid of it. Yeah, it's just, like I'm ready for whatever comes my way. It's like the fear just kind of washed away one day. You sure you're up for a drink? I can have one glass. And you can have the rest. Ooh. Well, you know, they do say, that wine is good for your health. - Oh, they do. - They do. Who is they? The people. You know that uh, is only about red wine, right? - Ehh. - Yeah. Shut up and pour. Wha... Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Don't move. Don't move. Alright. Where in the hell is he at? - Wh... - The old man. - Get his ass on out here. - Please don't hurt us. You can take anything you want, okay. I said now! You obviously have the wrong house. - There's no old man here. - Bullshit. That's his goddamn car out there in the driveway. What? That's my car. The Silverado, there's one in every other driveway out here. What? Every fucker out here has a Silverado or an F-150. Fuck! No. That shit's impossible. I saw him here. You're obviously in the wrong place. We don't know who you are. With that mask on, there's no way that we can identify you, so if you just leave now, it's like this never happened. Okay. No. On the ground. Both of you! Face down. Now! Call Frank Richards. Frank? Hey, man, look, I... I know you dodging my calls, alright? But I just want to clear the air, okay. Look, I didn't want the job. I mean I did want the job, but I didn't wanna take it from you. You know what I mean? But... but when you, when they... I mean somebody's gotta be Captain, right? And if it ain't gonna be you, then, it may as well may be me, right? Look, what I'm trying to say is, I always had respect for you. And all I'm asking is that you know, you step off. Let the real Captain do... Better start over. I'm on my way to your place right now. And I got a full bottle of Pappy gin. Well, almost a full bottle. But as your friend, I know your drunk ass is gonna open up the door for that. I didn't mean that. I mean I did mean it but you know, in a nice way, like friends giving each other shit. You know how the fuck I meant that. Now, see... now you got my... Got all my brain all twisted up. Frank, what I'm trying to say is I... Fuck. Oh looks like you gonna be doing heavy-lifting on this one. I wanted you to get some freshness. I'll be back with Chloe. I know you... ...wanna look your best. God, I miss you. And I know she misses you, too. But you should see her. She looks more like you every day. Don't worry about Chloe. She's doing just great. Now, you make one fucking move, I'm gonna kill you both. You understand? Frank Richards. - Run! - No fuck. You lying motherfuckers! Bitches! Get the fuck out! No. - Hey! Open the door. - Oh my God. - Open the door! - Come on, come on. Drop it. Now! I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding. Get your ass back out there. What the hell's the matter with you? Come on. Get back in that room. You think I'm stupid? I'm gonna fall for that shit. No! Don't... this. Enough! Enough. Hey, I got that bottle of Pappy for you. What? Who the fuck was that? Who the fuck is that? Shit. Hey, sit the fuck down. Come on, on the couch. Move! It's alright, okay? That old man? He's your dad, ain't he? Please. No, no, no, look. It's okay. It's okay. Things starting to make a hell of a lot more sense now. Stay here. I'm gonna need you to come with me. Why? I need your help getting his ass out of here. You understand? I can't. You're right. I guess I could just do it alone. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can't just take a dead body right out the front door in broad daylight now, can we? You dig in there and you get yourself a trash bag. Get a trash bag. Get up. I don't got time, you understand? Move. You're gonna stay right where you are, you understand me? - Do you understand me? - Yes, yes. Open it up. You need to get his head. I'ma get his feet, alright? - Okay? - Okay, okay. Come on. Set in inside. Yeah, that's it. You're not gonna hurt him, he's dead already. Come on. Push. Alright, alright. That's enough. Back up, back up. Let's go. Hope you're gonna stay still. Sit nice and quiet till I get back. You're gonna die today. You understand me? I'll be back. Wait, where are you going? To fix what's broke. He's gonna kill us. Oh, Chloe. Chloe, I can't get it off. I can't get it off. Aah! Chloe, help me. I'll be back soon. Relax, everything's okay. You... you two, stay cool. You, her. Oh, shit. Fuck! Shit! Goddammit! You call your dad now. There's no service out here. You know, I'm getting real tired of your damn bullshit. I'm telling you the truth, I swear. Alright. So, now you've seen my face, I think it's time for some motivation. Got one last chance. No, no, no, no, no! You call your dad and get outta here now. - Is a... is a land line... - Yeah. You just have to... Goddamn, what the fuck do you want? Alright, alright. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Please, stop! Look, I just cut harder and your friend's gonna bleed out pretty soon, unless you start cooperating. Now just calm down, you still got time to take her to a hospital and save her life. Okay, it's okay, I... I know where he'll be, I just have to call and confirm it. We're supposed to meet at this place called, "The Patch". What the fuck are you talking about? It's a place that we meet, we go out in the woods, okay? I just need to make sure that he's still coming. I've had enough of this horseshit. No, no, no, just let me call him. Just let me call him. Where in the hell is this place of yours? It's a half hour away. Nah, fuck that. He comes here or your friend dies. I can get you what you want. Call your dad on speaker. He better answer. Chloe? Dad, hey, um... What are you doing? Are you okay? Yeah, um, I'm just at the cabin and I wanted to make sure that you were still coming to The Patch later. What? The Patch, remember? We were supposed to meet there. Of course, honey. I'm coming right now. Okay. I love you, dad. Let's go. Clock's ticking. I'm alive? I'm alive. Oh shit, I'm shot up. But I'm alive. And I'm in a hole. Seriously. This is some KKK shit. Okay, okay, come on. Damn, it's hot in here. My back's burning up. This must be what a summer feels like. Come on, brother. Ain't no punk-ass crackhead gonna bring me down. I'm the motherfucking captain. Ah! What the fuck? Oh shit. What are you doin'? Come on. I said fucking move! Alright, come on get up. Come on, get up. I said, get up! Look at me! Hey, I need you focused, alright? We're already on the other side of the goddamn lake, now how much further? My dad has traps set out all over the place. You know, all the really bad stuff. We're almost there. Get going. Hey, hey! What the hell are you doing? Trying to hurry, isn't that what you want? Oh, good, you're starting to finally get it now. Halle-fucking-lujah. Ah, shit! Fucking lost. Hey! Hey, wait up! Shit, slow down! Goddammit. Hey, Christ! Slow the fuck down! You fucking bitch! How's that for focus? Never fuck with a bitch who's ready to die. You crazy bitch! Are you fucking stupid? Are you fucking stupid? You know, your girlfriend ain't the first person I cut like that. She's got like 20 minutes left to live, at most. So, you either take me where we need to go or she dies. - Okay. - And you get the fuck up. - Slowly! - Okay, okay. What are you doing? I ain't running into any more fucking trip wires, you hear me? Now, you're gonna listen to me! When I say stop, you're gonna stop! When I say go, you motherfucking go. You understand? - Yeah. - Good. Move your ass! Oh Lord, please give me strength. You know, I ain't never been shot up before. This is some Mel Gibson shit. And this sure ain't as badass like it looks in the movies. Why are you doing this? 'Cause I can't trust you? No, I mean, why are you doing any of this? Why do you need to get to my dad? Doesn't matter. You don't need to know. Quite honestly, I don't think you want to. Whatever happened and whatever this is, I'm sorry. Look. None of this shit's personal. Okay? It's just something I gotta do. No, you don't. And whatever this is, you don't have to do it. Yeah, I wish you were right. I really do. But you're not. So, from here on out shut your fucking mouth and do what I tell you. Okay? This is the spot. Alright. Listen, I need you to get wherever the hell you need to be. You hear me? No more fucking around, you understand? Or forget about your friend back there. Chloe? You okay, honey? Yeah, dad, I'm fine. Hello, Frank. I'm sorry, dad. Hey, look at me. It's gonna be okay. You did the right thing. You come alone? Do I look like I have an entourage? This ain't a joke? No shit. Who's that? Goddamn, motherfucker! What do you want? Shut up. You just shut up. Let me talk, okay? It's gonna be okay, honey. Yeah, only if you listen. Alright, put the gun down. Fuck you. Just tell me what you want. I ain't fucking around here! Who are you? Doesn't matter, okay. What do you want with her? - Take me instead. - Shut up. What? This? Looks familiar? Well, I guess you get it now, huh, old man? I just need you to disappear. That's it. - Now, drop the fucking gun. - Daddy, no. Let her go first. No, you kiss my ass, I make the rules. You made a crucial mistake, you should've pointed at me. Not her. Now, you're fucked. If you flinch, I'll put three bullets in your head. Fuck you, Frank. I'll kill her right where she stands. Then you die. Get your gun off her. On me. Oh yeah? Then what? When I see her in the distance, I'll drop my gun. You can do whatever you want. Look at me in the eyes. It's your turn, son. All the cards are on the table. I'd be very careful with your next hand. Don't you dare fuck around with me, old man. - Daddy. - It's okay, honey. Just run. - You listen to your dad. - No. Run, Chloe! Run! Go. Why don't you take... would you... Drop the f... drop the gun! Drop the gun! What? What the? No. No! Shit. Son of a... Oh God, I... Oh God. Oh, my God. Fuck. No. Fuck. Fuck! One thing at a time, no loose ends. Shit. Fucking... I wonder... I wonder if I can get a bonus. Shot pay. Yeah, I'm putting in for that shit. I know you can hear me. Can't be that far! Your friend ain't gonna make it. Your daddy's still alive! But he's hurt. Who's it gonna be? Your dad or your friend? You gotta make a choice. Where you at? Come on, Craig. Get it together. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left, right. Left, right. Left, left. Left, right left. Left, left, left, right, left. Alright, that... that... That shit don't rhyme or anything. I need my mama to kiss the... Mama! The Fuck. What the hell are you doing? Stop right there. On the ground. It's game over. I... What? What's so funny? That's a 36 revolver. And you just used your sixth shot. S... Shit! Hey, hey, hey. Wake up, hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. Hey, I need you to move with me, okay? Turn over, and... and drink this. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna go get key fob and I'll be right back, okay? Stay awake, okay? Shit, shit. - Okay, the guy's here. - Oh, my God. Listen, the guy, he knew that I was coming, we have to figure it... I thought that I had more time. I need you to get to the truck, okay? Why, what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna buy us some time. - Okay. How? I'm gonna do things my dad's way, plan for everything, that's what he said. Chloe, Chloe. Look, I just... I need you to do something, I need you to get to the truck, okay? Okay. If I don't make it... Look, if I don't make it, remember the name Virgil Brown. My God, Chloe, don't. No, no, look, look, I'm okay. I'm ready for whatever's coming my way. I love... I love you, Chloe. Ride or die, bitch. Okay, okay. Old faithful. Back in business. Look out, whitey, here I come. Oh, no, no, you bitch. I'ma make you hurt now. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. I said it's lights out for you. Lights out. You going to sleep. You fucking bitch! Get out. Come with me now! Stop squirming, stop squirming! Get. Get up! Get up! I've had enough of you fuckers. Drop the gun or die. Daddy? Honestly, feel bad for you. Look at you. You're just an old man with an old gun. Nothing personal, pal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But I guess, that was just God's will. Maybe. Maybe not. Son of a bitch. Hey. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Alright, okay. Hey, stay with me. Stay with me, okay? I'm gonna go get you help. Stop, stop, look. Motherfucker! Frank, Frank. Okay, take it. You're okay, yeah? Get in the car. Get to the hospital. Get to the main road. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna do what I do best. Dad... ...kill that motherfucker. Watch your mouth, young lady, I'm still your father. Now go. I love you. Go. Okay. Hello. See? Now, that's a gun. I got quite the collection now. Thank you, sir. I guess it's true what Jesus said. "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword." And you beat... Got a heart, old man. I'll give you that. But you already played the last hand. I'm afraid it's... Blackjack. Hmm, so much for my golden years. "Dear Frank, I know you are both going through something very difficult right now." "But I just know deep down, everything will be okay. I promise. I love you and can't wait for our dinner date tonight. Your loving wife." See you soon. Well, Frank, I guess I got that experience after all. Shit. You taught me everything I know. Truth is all I ever wanted was for you to believe in me. Because I always believed in you. I think you know that now. And I'm gonna be the captain that I know and you know... that I can be. I promise you that. So, what do you say, huh? How about that drink? To my homie. Ooh wooh! Damn, that's hard. Fuck it. Everything okay, Chief? Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, you know, I'm just doing that thing. Thank you for the um, the escort today. That meant a lot. Thank you, thanks for having me. Of course, we seriously thank you for everything. You know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna miss you out here. Really hope to see you again soon. So, you ladies thinking about thinking about coming back and visiting us from time to time? We've decided to stick around for a while. Yeah. Yeah. I really miss this place. Feels good here. Plus, you know, I heard we got a really great new police chief now. Thanks, Chloe. And that's good to hear. You know, you still got family here, a big one. Thank you, Craig. I mean, Captain East. - I'll see you girls around? - Yeah. What's on your mind? I was just thinking. I've so many memories with them on this dock. Learning to swim... learning to share. They really showed me what it was to be brave and have courage. They sound so incredible. And obviously knew what they were doing, because, Chloe... ...you're the bravest person I've ever known. I... I prayed so hard. So hard to understand all of this, to make sense of it all, but I... I don't think that I ever will. Just... You know, I was thinking about what my mom always used to tell me whenever I was scared or I was sad about something. She would always say, "Don't worry, we're in good hands." And... ...I never fully understood what that meant until now. My dad was the good hands that she was always referring to. That's really beautiful. And I'm sure completely true. God, I'm crying. Well... are you ready to go inside? Yeah. Oh, hold on. Hello. Hey, doctor. Yeah. Okay. Oh. What did she say? I'm good. It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be good.
