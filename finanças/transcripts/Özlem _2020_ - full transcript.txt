Sure. I love how you smell first thing in the morning. This cut is still not healing. - It will. Let's bandage it again. - Mmm. - Will it heal? - It will. Open your eyes, my love. What the hell? Such bullshit. - Fifteen if you win. - Okay. It's a good deal. Now... I booked you for four games in a row. Is that too much? All right, then. I've started taking bets. Free throw. Pleasure doing business, bro. - This isn't a wrestling match. - It's streetball, man, not the NBA! - What does that mean? - Hey, stop! - Let go of me! I'm gonna fuck him up. - Calm down. It's okay. Game over. Here. - We were still playing! - No, you won. Take it and get out of here. - Come on. Calm down, all right? - Dude, come on! No, come on. Sit down. - How much for the whole tray? - Twenty, man. - No school today, huh? - You tell me. We still have customers. - Fuck it. Let's just make some more money. - Mm-hmm. - Still haven't returned it yet? - They didn't take it back. I don't have anyone to give it to, either. I have someone in mind, actually. But I'm not sure if I have the balls. Take it, then. And you'll know. Hello! No, yeah. Yeah, man. We're definitely down. Yeah, and two games works for us. - What's up? Who were you eyeing? - Mind your own business. Come and join us. Good morning. We didn't get to talk. I seem to remember we had a date. I'm sorry. I've been distracted. Let me help you out. - Good morning! - Morning. Mr. Refik, you remember we were going to switch classes for Wednesday. - Yes, I remember. Don't worry. - Thank you. I appreciate it. No worries. Miss! Do you have a second? Is there a chance we can move things to the end of next week? Please, I didn't get a chance to study. My parents will kill me! - Okay, I get it. - She said it's okay! Wait a second. Stop. - Come on. You just said you'd postpone it! - No, I did not say that. Hey! Can I talk to you for a sec? - Here. - What's this? - Are you for real? Come on. - Thanks for the beer, but I don't drink. Fine. I'll drink them both, then. Hot mussels! Hot mussels! Why did you make me come here? I thought we weren't friends anymore. Işık, please, can you cut it out? Come on. You know, I've been thinking. I think I know why you got so upset yesterday. And why you switched your test paper with Sinan's. We share a desk, after all. I mean, I did it as a favor. But he just... - Yeah, right. Whatever you say. - Of course, Eda. Why else would I do it? But I didn't realize how much of an asshole he could be. That's Sinan. He's an asshole in a nutshell. The real question is why do you all of a sudden care so much? Is it really that obvious? No. But I can tell. Do you think Sinan knows? Did he hurt me as a way to say he's not interested? I have no idea. Who knows what goes on in that fucked-up mind of his. I'm not gonna apologize. Okay, fuck it. I guess I'm sorry. It's just that apologies are questionable expressions at best. As they often only serve the person apologizing. Are you seriously getting philosophical right now? Fair enough. I'll get to it. Altuna is really into her. - How do you know? - I know there's something going on. From what I saw, they're both too proud to make the first move. I'm thinking about talking to them. Then we can come up with a new plan and move forward. Let's not call it off just yet. - You said you didn't know about love. - I know about weakness. And love is the worst of them. It makes you lose your self-respect. So... a new plan or not? So why now? What do you mean? What made you start caring? Why? And why are you so angry all the time? Or is it because you're just hangry? I'm not angry all the time.. And I'm not hungry either. I'm usually just very full of beer. But you are angry. - Do you know what a graphic designer does? - Yeah. It's a worthless job. There's no money in it... No prestige, either. Who'd want to be a graphic designer? Sounds like you do. Why would I? I'm a very pretty girl, you know? I should just marry a rich guy, live a life of luxury. Not be hunched over a computer. Beauty is an asset. It's not worth anything unless you turn it into success. Well, by success, are you talking about having money? - Yep. Is there any other kind? - Of course there is! Being happy. Living with people you love. I don't know. You know, making a difference in the world around you. Doing a job that you love even if you don't make that much. Yeah, but it's not that easy. Let's say you want to travel the world. You need money to do that, don't you? Honestly, I would prefer swimming in this shitty little coastline than traveling the world with someone I have to pretend to love. I see that Sinan's been brainwashing you. Oh, what are we gonna do with these long lives ahead of us? Who will we become? What will we achieve? ♪ I can't take my words back ♪ ♪ I can't rewrite what I already wrote ♪ Hey, shut the fuck up! Fuck off, man! ♪ I can't turn back again ♪ ♪ If my tears are dropping May they not dry ♪ ♪ May my cheering Loving heart never stop ♪ ♪ May my old, friendly memories not call ♪ We were true to ourselves at 17. Did we lose ourselves along the way? Sometimes, I can't help but wonder. Is this the real me? Have I always been this person? Have you ever thought about these things? Thank you, man. I don't like you at all. I know. It's okay, I'm used to it. Okay, we don't need to like each other, guys. Let's be pragmatic. We have a common goal, and we're all in this together. Understand? I'll talk to the girls, you talk to Mr. Altuna. Hm? Is this a bad time? What do you need? Wanna drink? Why are you always acting like a fucking drug dealer? Okay, I'll go. Wait. Come back. So what's your deal? Are you traumatized because, like, your injury made you quit basketball? I'm not gonna be friends with a 17-year-old piece of shit. This is a school. That's not how things work around here. Well, I'm different. Nobody has expectations of me, so I can do whatever I want. Good for you. Why are you here? Are you really that much of a loser? - I'm curious about you. What's your deal? - My deal? Let's make one thing perfectly clear: I hate 17-year-olds. I hated myself when I was 17. I'm the last person who should be a teacher, and probably the worst person to guide anyone. I'm telling you this in case you expect some kind of Dead Poets Society situation. Believe me, I don't need another dad. Since you're here, what's your deal? You don't need to worry about me. Drink up. I was right. He's an emotional guy. I think he's capable of falling in love with someone. I don't think he's a complete asshole. He's good. - "Good"? - I mean, he's a decent guy... at heart. He just doesn't care what people think. Hopefully. - I genuinely think he's a good person. - Is there really such a thing as "good"? You sure you want to ask him that? You're getting into philosophy. He's not gonna shut up. Right. Are you saying this might work? Hey, boys. We're in a good mood, huh? I wouldn't have come if it weren't for Osman. How are you, Işık? I'm okay. I'm sorry. Ooh! Mr. Altuna's in love with her. - Yeah? - When? Well, let's not go that far, but there's definitely something going on. We're back to "something"? Hope is so fucked up. - What do we do now? - Let's get out of here and go to my place. - Seriously, guys? - What? Come on. We have Geography class. Oh, come on, Işık. You gotta be kidding me. So there are 54 countries in Africa. In Northern Africa, there is Morocco, Algeria, Libya... All on the same latitude. Okay? All right. In Southern Africa, we have Namibia, Tanzania, Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, and Mozambique. Please turn to page five. The wiring in this school will kill us all one day. Mr. Refik, please be careful with that. Well, how are you? It's been a while. Do you two normally see each other more? I mean, how wonderful for our teachers to be getting along so well. I think there must be a misunderstanding. Obviously, the coach was just making an observation. Nothing more, nothing less. You understand. Just an observation. You know Ms. Distas is always right. What are you saying? I'm just gonna call Ramo to tidy up this mess. Is there something you want to say to me? Hey, are you all right? - See you tomorrow. - See you later. All right, I'm done. Let's go to your house. We always end up waiting for you. You work way too much. Why would you do that? Have a good evening. Who's that? Are you shitting me? She has a frickin' boyfriend! - Holy shit. - What the hell? - We're fucked. - What is this? She's already in love with someone else. We never should have interfered with her love life. - What's the plan now? - There is no plan. We go home. ♪ An angel's smile is what you sell ♪ ♪ You promise me heaven Then put me through hell ♪ - Did you miss me? - Oh, it's so hot in here. Of course I did. How was the drive? It was exhausting... but worth it. Not in front of the kids! - Ta-da! - Oh, wow... You remembered. How could I forget? They smell like home. You like them? Huh? Mmm. Thank you. So glad we're back together. What is going on here? Where did he come from? - Aren't you gonna show me your room? - There's no need. I have to go. - You just don't want me in there. - I've got to get to class. All right. Bye. Have a good day. Have a good day. - Hey there. How are you? - Hello. I'm fine, thank you. Darling, darling, you forgot your folder! Your folder! Burcu, wait! - We'll get rid of him, then! - No way! That's going way too far. Nope, that's saving our asses! She has to fall in love to get married so she can stay here. Okay, she can marry this guy. What's the problem? His license plate number is from Trabzon, so he's gotta be her boyfriend. Get it? She probably asked to be moved closer to him. I mean, her family is already there. - Fuck this shit. - Okay, but that's her decision. It's not our place to get involved. - I'm out from now on. - The guy is a piece of shit. Well, all right, he's not hot, but he's not so bad. It's not like he's a troll. Well, he's got a bad personality, too. It'll be good for Distas to get rid of him. He's not right for her. Sinan, that's a reach, even for you. How can you even know that? Besides, Ms. Distas is a very nice person. She must've found someone kind. Well, she didn't. He's a piece of shit! Enough with this "piece of shit" talk. We need a new plan. - So what do you suggest? - Wait a minute! If he is a piece of shit, are you in? Because if so, we'll be doing her a favor by getting rid of him. Well... I wouldn't want her to ever be unhappy. Don't forget to practice and do your homework! I want your songs ready by next week, okay? He's here to pick her up. It's kinda romantic, you know? I think it's beautiful. We shouldn't spoil it. I'll show you how beautiful it is. - What's up? - What's he doing? Where are you going, man? Hello. We met this morning. Oh, hi. Ms. Distas sent me down here. She said, "Sinan, my friend is waiting down there. Tell him I'm coming right away." Okay. All right. Thank you. What's this idiot up to? He's going to get sick. She is such a sweet person, isn't she? She told me she wanted to talk to me as well. She asked me to wait with you. Probably about the homework I just turned in. I hope I get a good grade. It's really important to me. Look at this motherfucker! He could at least give him the jacket. - Like you would. - What? Sinan's already wet, and the guy could get sick. Would you give your jacket to some random kid? First, I don't get sick. Second, if I see a son of a bitch out there in the freezing rain, I'd make sure he doesn't die. I guess she's running late. She probably forgot something. Possibly. You know, Ms. Distas is my favorite teacher at this school. - I was really sick last year. My lungs. - Mm. - She was always there for me. - Mm. My left lung is deflated, you know. Can you believe that? Burcu is nice, yeah. Hey! Sinan! Why are you out here? - You must be freezing. - Oh, right. That's true. - Where's your... - Here, here. Take my jacket. Here. - You asked him to wait here? - Me? I didn't. I guess I got it wrong, then. My bad. I'll return your jacket later. - All right. Take this, too! - No need. I'm all good. Thank you. - What's going on? - Come on, let's go. We're soaking! Which part don't you get? He only gave him the jacket after she showed up. But he gave it at the end, didn't he? He's a good person. You were wrong. I'm out. Besides, I really don't get why you did that, Sinan. You okay? The guy's anemic. He'll drop dead any second. No one would notice if you died, you know? What happens when you're sick? Your mom's not here. Who takes care of you? Why? Do you get sick to get your mom's attention? - Sinan, I'll fix you some soup. - No, I don't want it. - Why not? You need medicine too, Sinan. - I said I don't want it. - Sit down. - What do you mean, "no"? - I don't want it! - But you're sick! I'll make you some soup. Guys, let's just stop this, okay? We need to be productive. Come here. Sit down. Are you convinced? He almost let him die. Are you ready to take him down? No! We can't play with people's lives like this. After all, they made a choice to be together. Can't you see? Then let's try again tomorrow. What? What are you saying? Hey, wait up! Coach! Yeah, what? Ms. Distas asked us to wait for her. - Us? What's this about? - Uh-huh. I don't know. She said, "Wait for me. Don't go anywhere." You're an even bigger moron than I thought. Here, put this on. You'll freeze to death. - She told us to wait. - I'll wait. You can go. - Now you're getting wet. - I don't care about a little rain. You're out in a t-shirt in this weather. Thought you were a little smarter than that. You see the difference now? Good seems bad. Bad seems good. The greatest treachery of this world. All those kind acts cover up the filth. Those you call rude are the truly good ones, and that's why the good ones always lose against the bad ones. This world is so fucked up. He gave you his jacket, just like that. He just gave it without trying to show off or impress her. And he waited out in the rain for nothing. Well, yeah, you've seen it. What do you say? I guess you're right. He's not right for her. Not a gentleman like Mr. Altuna. Here, Sinan. So, what are we going to do? Take it, Sinan! If you ask me, I think Mr. Altuna is the right person for her. Now comes the easy part. We can have some real fun. Stirring up some trouble. I love it. - We'll make sure to tear them apart. - Are we even capable of that? Maybe he's amazing and drives her crazy in bed. If he was really that great, she wouldn't have fallen for Mr. Altuna in the first place. It's obvious she started a relationship with that guy, and now she's stuck. It happens sometimes. You get scared of love and go hide in the corner. You should just feel it. Whatever that feeling is. - You think so? - I do. It's not always a bad thing to lose control. We couldn't even set up Distas with Altuna. How we going to break these two apart? That's easy. Breaking is easier than making. - You're saying we'll break them apart. - Yeah, we will. So we're doing it, then? We are! That's our plan, right? - Good morning! - Morning. Sinan's not here? Must be napping somewhere. So what do we do now? We need a break-up plan before we take things further. I think Ms. Distas is just having fun. - She's got the day off, though. - Why is that? Slow down. I wish we'd held this engagement at our place. Something bigger, fancier. I didn't want to take the time off, Mom. Never mind. It's just one day. - I don't feel good about this. - Mom, please. I don't know how you convinced us to have it here. - Oh, look at you! - Hello. - I'm so glad you could make it. - Oh, sweetheart, look how pretty you are! Do you know how a marriage should be? When a man comes home from work and wants to be left alone, his woman should do so. If he comes home and wants attention, she should accept it and give it to him. If you come home without money, she should be comforting. This is the woman every man needs. We take the first step. Well, I wish both of you the best. PATIENT REGISTRATION Can I help you? Where's the ER? Where are your parents, honey? I need their signature to put you on drip. - I can sign it. - You can't. We need their approval for the drugs in the IV drip. If they're in the parking lot, I can go check with them. I guess... I better go and... - No, don't get up. I'll look. - No, I'm fine. - Please don't get up. - I'll go get them. - You have a fever. Where are you going? - I don't know where they're going.
