Stop making trouble, buddy Sorry Captain Gao I'm late Hello there enough stand up Because Mr. Adams was injured We need to accept an urgent task To repair our relationship with important customers In recent years, the economy of Sakia has continued to develop But because a group of international bandits committed crimes across the border Greatly disrupted regional peace and stability The current situation here is very severe The culprits did not hesitate to use Agent Orange and other biological weapons The people suffer And our task this time is to assist Escorting the International Peace Foundation Supplies Go to the aided area in the north Hello everyone I'm Lucian Chen I am the International Peace Foundation project manager What's in the truck Food seed water purifier No dangerous goods That's the gangster's place This is our job We need your escort All right Full hearing We leave at 12 o'clock Extremely dangerous equipment level Disband What do you think this is Come and go What you say is not a trifle This escort will pass through the bandit control area 12 o'clock departure Where do you find someone Don't be ashamed if you want to join But with conditions What condition First absolute obedience second You descend from a sniper to an escort Only use P90 no problem Captain Gao I want to see your tactical command How awesome is it beauty Been here for a few years Four years Just kidding The conflict here only broke out for three years Before the war I'm here as a volunteer for an international organization Is there a problem no problem How much can we earn after finishing this ticket estimate Enough for you to eat and drink Two lifetimes You can also engage in some chicks singing Then why did you choose to come here Compared to standing in an office building and eating a twenty-dollar lunch Watching the news Falsely express an angry expression I would rather stand here and eat my mouthful of sand At least we are doing things You think too simple Just like us I thought I could win save lives Actually the reality is cruel But at least we have hope As long as we are here As long as we are doing work There is hope to end the conflict The conflict will never end Because there will be conflicts where there are people Otherwise, what shall we eat Where can I make money anyway Where i go If you don’t need a doctor because you have eliminated the disease So does the doctor need not exist?
