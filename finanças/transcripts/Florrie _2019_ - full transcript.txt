So how's it going with the Lexus campaign? It goes. What do you have so far? Brace yourself for this one. A car that blank. That's all you have? You don't have any adjectives yet? I'm afraid not. Well at least you've identified that it's a car. That's half the battle. You wouldn't want people thinking it's like a type of soft drink or something. I have a master's degree. This shouldn't be so hard. Today's your lucky day. I'm about to bail you out. Oh? Here we go. Ready? Wait. Let me get a firm grip on this chair. All right, go. Lexus. I'm loving it. Not your finest. Okay, what about this? Lexus. Who says there's no cure for micro penis? It would work better for an SUV or a handgun. You're a bit off brand with that one. Okay, for real. Lexus. What else you gonna spend 100 grand on? Cocaine? Maybe. Let's keep that one on the back burner. Apparently the market research shows that luxury car owners see the world as a chaotic hell hole that they need to be cocooned from. I"m thinking of exploiting that angle. Lexus. Like crawling back into your mother's womb. Maybe we show an ultrasound, but it's a guy driving a Lexus where the penis normally is. What are you doing after work? Do you wanna hit a patio? No lucky guy tonight? No, just me. That's a change. Okay, let's leave early. As far as I'm concerned, we've certainly earned our salary today and then some. Agreed. Lexus. You think it's Swedish but it's really Japanese. Lexus. Henry Miller's most entertaining novel. Those two gentlemen send these drinks over with their compliments. Which ones? Don't you have enough already? I'm thinking about you. They're right over there. I don't think so. What do you think? I wouldn't. Come on. We don't wanna be rude and reject their generosity. Tell them we say thank you but that we're lesbians. That's harsh. Thank you. To our summer. Cheers. You're not attempting the scholar's mate, huh? No. Because I am wise to that. Are you wise to the Hiroshima sacrifice? No. You come here. How is it only 7:00 p.m.? Ow. Body shot. Ow, that hurt my boob. I feel really sick. Oh god. So, I was thinking we'll leave Friday afternoon and then we'll be back Monday noon-ish. You know I'm not really a cottage person. Oh come on, you're in this park all the time. The cottage is this park times 10. You can go fishing and... You can go fishing here. You can't compare that dirty old pond to the lakes up north. It might be a dirty old pond, but it's my dirty old pond. Besides, why do you guys always have to bring your women? What happened to the society of men? You want us to descend into barbarism? What do you think about this? I don't know. It's nice, I guess. I found it when I was jogging in the park just sitting there all by itself in the bushes. What do you think it means? You know my friends ask about you all the time. Do you not like them? I'd rather you didn't talk about me so much. Well that's just 'cause they thought that I was making you up. I met them that one time. Yeah, yeah, that one time for about an hour and then you had to go. Well. Places to kill. People to see. Okay, how 'bout this? You go to the cottage with your friends and the next weekend we'll hold a barbecue. We can invite both of our friends. Hm? You know you can be a little standoffish at times. I don't see what the problem is. One party just became two. I think that's a pretty good deal. You seriously don't wanna go to the cottage? I seriously don't wanna go to the cottage. But... I was thinking maybe we could go up to my apartment. Hm? Okay. Come on. That was nice. What was that for? Watching you from behind, you deserve a lot more than just a kiss. You certainly know how to flatter a girl. Let's keep going. - Whoever finishes first. - No. Gets to go on top. Hey. So that was a good workout. I'm proud of your effort. I didn't like that. I feel kind of nauseous. Well you almost passed out twice. Well. Well no, one of the times I was just pretending so you would stop. Just so I could slow down. Great. I'll have a water please. Can I have a chocolate milkshake with two pumps of syrup and extra cream? Do you want a Big Mac Mcflurry gummi bear sandwich with that too? You know what? You just do you. I'll do me. We just worked out. You gotta keep this tight for me. Come on now. Please don't let your health regime ruin this beautiful moment. All right, all right, but I'm gonna make you work it off later. How? We'll come up with that. Open up. Any more wine? Il n'y a pas. So are you happy with how everything went? The seller was thrilled. The buyer got a beautiful house at a great price. I get genius points from both parties. Plus, a very generous commission. Ah, that's my Thompson, the tender shark. I don't know about the shark part. So how are you gonna treat yourself? Actually I was thinking about treating us. Oh really? I like the sound of that. The client I sold for was thrilled with my work, so he gave me his apartment in Sicily for a week. Oh. So I was thinking we'll eat pizza, drink wine, hang out on the beach. What do you think? I don't think I can get away from work. You're always bragging you can work from anywhere. And besides the flying. You'll sleep on the plane. One week. It'll be great. Don't get me wrong. It's a fabulous offer but... But you refuse? Even if it means you can knock off from work from a patio everyday. Let me look at my calendar and think about it. What's there to think about? Free place to stay. Sicily. Sun. Us. Well let me look into it. You know, I'm beginning to think you're not taking me seriously. What are you doing Saturday? Can you drive me to pick up my new bike? Are you scared? No, I just want to get there before the store closes. I was talking about the trip. Right. Sorry. Florrie, I'm crazy about you. Haven't I shown that? You have. If there's something about me or about us as a couple that's giving you pause, let's talk about it. I don't know where this is coming from. It's been on my mind for awhile now. I'm very happy to be spending time with you. Have I ever given you a hard time? Have we ever even had a fight? No, but if we have a touch of conflict once in awhile, is that such a crime? There's nothing we couldn't solve with a little communication. You're right. It's my fault. I shouldn't have brushed off your trip proposal. Maybe it is a bit early to be going on a big trip together. That's fine. Now you're giving me something. I care about you. I know. Listen. We'll bring up the trip in a week or so. If we can make it, great. If not, it's not the end of the world. Thank you. You want another grape? Uh huh. Oh man, I think it's raining. Here. The logistics must be a pain in the ass. Have you ever screamed out the wrong name while you're having sex? I only scream for the Dalai Lama. Stop. What logistics? I'm doing it, what can I say? Well if none of them know about each other, what are you gonna do if one of them asks if you're seeing other people? Well if none of them have asked six months in, what are the chances of them asking now? You little shit. Well I guess if you can juggle them all for now at least, then you know why not? The juggling's tricky, but what's harder is when one of them wants to spend time with me and I have to say no. That's not surprising. From everything you've told me, the feelings for you are genuine. I had to say no to Matt yesterday. Poor guy. You should've seen him. He wanted to go to the zoo. It was so cute. I felt terrible letting him down. Why'd you brush him off? Because I had to see Thom for his birthday, which was a reschedule from last week when I brushed Thom off to see James because he was some keynote speaker at an athletics convention. Can you take one of these guys off my hands? I'd go with James. He's pretty cute. The other day we went to the Edward Hopper show at the museum. You should've heard the guy express his feelings about the paintings. You may think he's all muscles, but I'm telling you the man has the soul of a poet. How am I supposed to let that go? Florrie, maybe you should, you know, just scale it back a bit. Look, I get it after everything that's happened, things are amazing for you right now, but you're not thinking of anybody but yourself. Have you ever considered that maybe one of these guys have you in mind when they're thinking about their future? I wonder if guys have these dilemmas when they're dating multiple women. No, gender has nothing to do with it. It's about being direct and honest. We're in our 30s, you know. You can... Hey, hey, hey. For the record I'll have you know I'm not 30 'til next week. Which one of them are you gonna go out with for your birthday then? I don't even wanna think about that. Can we make it a girls night? Are you considering any of these guys for the long term? I think so. It's hard to say. Well, like which one is the best fit for you? They all have different qualities and specific things I like about them. It's hard to pick just one. And really, how practical is it to pick just one? I mean, look at the divorce rates. The numbers don't lie. I know this guy, he's been dating two women. It's like they're a couple or like a threesome I guess. They've been making it work for two years. Maybe you're the one that's gonna break the mold for four. God, that could only work if we had multiple washrooms in the house. I mean, I am not sharing a washroom with Thom or Matt for that matter. Oh and then we'd have to live in like a Mormon style compound. Or another option is you can maintain the status quo. Eventually one of them's bound to drop you. Oh 'cause I'm so easily dropable. Okay, just humor me. What if one of them called you up today and said 'I'm moving on?' I like to think I'm pretty irresistible. Just answer the question. I guess I'd feel a bit hurt. Relieved maybe. I don't know. I might actually feel kind of empty. Okay, don't you think that says something? You know, sometimes your utter lack of ambition shocks me. Come on, let's go get ice cream. Come on. Okay. It's funny I, I don't feel like I'm lying to these guys but, you're a different person with different people, right, so there's only a fraction of you that they actually see and part of that's kind of nice. It's not a terrible thing to reinvent yourself to be someone else for a little while. It's also terrible not to be fully known. I don't think people wanna know that kind of thing. It's too much. I don't know. Maybe they do. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. I don't know, but like then- Like then who are you? Who are you living for, Florrie? What are you doing? I always really bought into that adage, you know, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I don't think that's true. I think there are- I don't think that's true either. See. That's a bunch of shit. There's some stuff that happens to you that takes a chunk and you just have to keep going but you're not okay. And how do you? How do you go up to somebody who you wanna have a relationship with and present yourself as this like amputated person with chunks missing from you and be like here I am, here's all the parts? Here's the parts that aren't there. Yeah, but don't you think these other people have chunks missing, too? Not in the same way. How do you- How do you explain yourself? I don't. You don't. See? I wonder if ducks ever get thirsty. Probably not. You know if you weren't here right now, I would not have come to the park. A couple nights ago, the sun was coming down, so it wasn't like totally dark out yet. Yeah. I was walking just on the path by myself, thinking I should really get out of here. This is not so good. And I hear in the bushes like. I'm like what is that, a raccoon or something? And I go and there's like a man fully jerking off. Oh my god, this park is... And then he like looks up at me like I'm intruding. Excuse me. So yeah and I'm instinctively I'm just like, sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt your private moment. Do you want me to just like you know, turn around or move? Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and whip as mad men do and the reason why they're not so punished and cured is that that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love, too. But I prefer securing it by counsel. Did you ever cure any so? Yes. One. And in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him everyday to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, change belonging and liking, proud, fantastical, full of tears, full of smiles.

How do I get your life? Shit. Whoa. The gentlemen were looking for you. I told them you weren't here as per your instructions. Thank you. Florrie, give me a break. I can't believe him doing your dirty work. Please. I have always been such a sucker for sunflowers. Aw. Look at this. Tickets to the opera. These are box seats. You know the kind that you go in, you get your own coat hanger? Ooh, very fancy. That must be Thompson. It is. That man has such wonderful taste. What's in the box? I don't know. Let's see. Look at this. What a sweetheart. Don't tell me those are homemade. Uh huh. Matt is so good in the kitchen. You have no idea. What else? What's this? Oh just a love letter from James. No. Listen to this. 'I want to lay you down like a diamond.' And here. 'A woman without freckles is like the sky without stars.' I didn't know you had freckles. On my back. Florrie, you gotta stop all this. What are you doing? Hey, for my eyes only. You're not giving any of these guys an honest chance. You wanna fling around, great, but come on. Don't be so dramatic. Look, this guy did all this baking. You don't think he has better things to do with his time? Instead he's trying to make you happy. You can't even let him take you out for an hour on your birthday. Well I can't go out with all of them on the same day, can I? This guy spent $600 for tickets to the opera. You've been dating for six months. It's not like he's trying to get into your pants. I could be going out with a guy like this. Don't tell me you're jealous? You know what? I don't wanna see you right now. My advice, grow the fuck up and be honest with these guys. Don't be so sensitive, Henri. Oh yeah. By the way, Happy Birthday. Tickets to the baseball game. Good luck trying to find somebody to go with. Please, Henri, can we talk about this? No, I wanna go. Don't you think you're overreacting a little bit. I don't wanna go to the baseball game with one of them. You are overreacting, you know that? I'll call you. Wait, are you? You're the artist in residency here? Yes, I am. Dom. Good morning. Florrie. Nice to meet you. All right. What are you working on? Well, I think I feel pretty good about it. What do you think? Now be honest. I can take it. I think it's definitely going somewhere. Good. This is wonderful. Ah. You noticed. That one there is the mother. This will be the daughter. It's beautiful. Well thanks. What brings you around, Florrie? Oh. I was playing detective. Actually, You might be able to help me with this. Lady detective. I like it. Shoot. I found this in the park. Really? It's nice. It's got a strong hand to it. That's the second one I found in the last few weeks. Really? How could you lose two? Right? I think they're being left on purpose. Some sort of art trick or prank type thing. Sounds like a lot of work for some cheap ploy. I'm pretty sure that the wood is black oak. There's lots of it here in the park. So you think the sculpture is indigenous to the park? And you said you found these? Nobody passed them off to you? Right. Maybe someone has a crush and they're taking a more creative route. Well, my card's pretty full these days. Someone could be following you, or know your routines well enough to plant these beforehand. Still, what are the odds? One is a happy accident but two... So you think I have a stalker, eh? You could turn the tables on them. If you see somebody picking up tree branches, follow them and see what the hell they do with them? That's a great idea. Thanks. I'm here all summer. Let me know if you find something. Thanks, Dom. You got it. I should get you a bottle of wine one of these days. Oh, I'll hold you to that. Okay. See, it's easy. You just roll from top to bottom and then we're gonna ball it up and cover it and let it sit for about an hour. An hour? All right, once you taste this pasta, you're gonna forget you ever waited. Is there a fast food version of this? I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. You got something. Oh yeah? Do I? - Do I? - Just there. - No, don't. - Do I, huh? That's mean. I'm ordering a pizza. What, but? It's pasta night. I don't think it's a good idea to move in. I like how my life is right now. At the risk of being indelicate, when was the last time you slept over at my house? Listen for a sec. Okay. What don't you hear? Traffic, police cars, drunk guys. Downtown's a 17 minute subway ride if I need. And besides, you know you're always welcome here. If it were up to me, I'd be here every night. Well my darling Thompson, it's not only up to you, is it? Besides, if we saw each other everyday, we'd both probably start to get at each other. Disrupt the balance we have. In all fairness, honey, the scales are tipped way in your favor. Am I not with you? Are we not together? What plans do you have today? I was thinking we could go for a jog together. No, I can't. I have some showings in an hour. Dinner tonight? No can do. Plans. Of course. Why is it that scheduling things with you always feels like climbing Everest? There are 80 year olds who have climbed Everest without any difficulty so it can't be that hard. This tastes like bleach. Well you know, it's the good kind of bleach. Oh, we gotta go. We just got here. Relax. I just gotta go. Can I finish my expresso at least? You can do whatever you want. I have to go. Hey, hey, Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? I just wanted to go. I don't buy that at all. If I wanna go, I go. Are you gonna tell me what's really going on? You're right. I saw an ex professor who always had a crazy crush on me and I didn't wanna make conversation, so it was just easier to leave. Do you want me to go talk to the guy? No. Let's just forget about it. What are the odds I run into him anyway? Let's go. Let's have an expresso in the park. Let me talk to the guy. I'll tell him to back off. No, no, no, no really. It's fine. Okay, let's just go. Okay. Let's go. What are you working on? Just a little something. It's pretty much ready. Are you ready? Mm hm. I crave your mouth, your voice, your hair. Silent and starving I prowl through the streets. Bread does not nourish me. Dawn disrupts me. All day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps. I hunger for your sleek laugh. Your hands the color of a savage harvest. Hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails. I want to eat your skin like a whole almond. I want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body. The sovereign nose of your arrogant face. I want to eat fleeting shade of your lashes. And I pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight, hunting for you, for your hot heart like a puma in the barrens of Barcelona. Henri. Hen. I know you can hear me. Look. This guy's expensive and he's hard to book. I don't have a lot of time. I called you twice. Why didn't you call me back? I'm still a little pissed if you wanna know. You don't think you overreacted just a little bit? May I say something as a friend who loves you dearly? Do you know what you need? What? You need a good dumping. Oh, that's what I need, is it? Just think about it for a second. When was the last time you got dumped good and proper? Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back. That's on me. But- This guy's expensive. I gotta go. Yeah, I'll call you later, all right? Oh, incoming. Oh my god. Should have warned her. Yeah. Henri? I thought you hated Shakespeare. I do, but it's such a beautiful night, so I figured why not? Henrietta, I've heard so much about you. It's nice to finally meet you. My name's Thompson. Henrietta Lowens. Nice to meet you. Sit with us. Yeah. No, I don't wanna intrude on your date night. No, don't be silly. It'll be great. No. Florrie and I will sit together, we'll talk through the whole play and it'll probably ruin it for you. Well do join us for a drink afterwards. It's rare I get to meet one of Florrie's friends and actually come to think of it, you might be the first. I don't know what you're talking about. But he is right though, you should totally join us for a quick drink. I'd love to, but I probably won't make it through this whole thing anyway and I really need to get to be early tonight. Oh, how 'bout dinner another night? I could book us a dinner table this Friday at the new pizza place on Annette Street? Oh, I can't commit that far in advance. Henrietta. Why don't you call us Thursday night and let us know if you can make it? Yeah, probably be best to play it by ear. Enjoy the play, Florrie. Nice to meet you, James. It's Thompson. Sorry, excuse me. Thompson. Talk to you later. Yeah. She seems great. Should try to make a dinner date work. Yeah. Do you wanna go in? Yeah. Even those who did not know her were worn by something exceptional. Something exorbitant about her. Or perhaps by a telepathic suggestion such as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of applause at moments when Burma was being sublime. Okay, look at that cloud. What does that look like? It's not a raccoon. That's an aardvark. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, now I see it. I'm getting so much better at tennis. My swing's actually improving a lot. Happy birthday. They would ask one another who is she? Or sometimes would interrogate a passing stranger or make a mental note of how she was dressed. A new restaurant opened close to the house. Mom loves it. It's actually a lot of food that she can take out and bring home. She doesn't have to cook as much and I think she's happy about that. See that butterfly? Auntie Mary came over. She planted those sunflowers again. I gotta go. Give dad a hug for me. I'll see you next week. Love you. Hey, good morning. My name's Florrie. I really like your carvings. They're not for sale. Would it be okay if I just looked at one? All right, but be very careful. Wow, I like it a lot. The details are really nice. Mm hm. By any chance is this your work? Bullshit. Of course that's not mine. Why of course not? This bastard is ripping me off. Can't you see? I've been doing this work for 15 years and this guy comes in and thinks he can steal my spirit. Well, he can go to hell. And if he comes near me... Wait, it's a he? Do you know where I can find him? Get lost, lady. Okay look, I will leave my phone number with you and if you see him maybe you can tell him that I'm looking for him. Are you deaf? I'm done with you. Good. Productive. So the party was over and everyone went home and I really didn't think very much of it. I was 16. It was no big deal, you know I just had fun, that was enough for me. But the next day my mom was getting all these calls from all the other moms asking about my cookies. And then after that before I knew it, I was making cookies everyday after school. I can just picture you. 16, working up a sweat in the kitchen. I bet you were irresistible. It was at that moment I knew I could affect people in a real tangible way. You know it seems so simple. A baguette, a cookie. It means so much. You know I read this thing once from some philosopher guy, and he said a connected and true happiness is in being of service to people. That idea hit me. Like if someone takes my bread home, I disappear completely, but at the same I am present in every bite they take. It's like a secret magic act, but you're the only one that knows both sides of the trick. You know I just wanna get to the next level. Jorge's a really great boss, but I just wanna expand on our vision, but he's so happy with being in the same place. I can't blame him while his business is doing so well. Why fix what ain't broke, right? You know I envy your business sense. You take intangibles and make them concrete. Oh god, they're more like vapors. Don't sell yourself short. You are doing something so close to pure creativity. I follow a recipe, a formula, and you are literally making things out of thin air. Come on, it's just advertising. It's not just advertising. It's a whole art form. You know What? I think you might be prettier than me. Look at those eyelashes. Hey. You seriously wouldn't rather be doing something else? You could be an astronaut. Yeah. A marine biologist. Ooh, a sex columnist. You're a good writer, right? Isn't that what you got your masters in? Last time I checked there are no job openings for space bound dolphin sex therapists. Besides, writers make no money. You think I'm giving up this beautiful apartment by the park to change the world or whatever? Would you rather make money or do something more? Is everything okay? Yeah. Of course, it's fine. Come in here. Why? Just come in. Come on. This better not be your idea of spicing up our sex life. Just get in, will you? Hey. Now, this is something my mom used to do when I was kid and she called it going to Hawaii. The tub is Hawaii. I didn't know your family was poor. Hey, hey. Stop being silly, okay? Close your eyes. Okay. Now you're there, okay. Picture yourself in Hawaii. All right, you can feel the water on your feet. This is so hippy dippy. Just give it a shot, okay? Close your eyes, please. All right. So you feel the water on your feet. Imagine the palm trees above you and look around and imagine that you have the entire beach to yourself. Now, I think you can help dolphins reach orgasm in space or do anything else you wanna do. Okay? Okay. This is not what Hawaii's about, okay. You're a crazy person. With all the hipster places in the neighborhood, if I had to rate it, top one. Really. The $14 white tea is worth every penny. Ah, fuck the white tea. You look gorgeous. How long have we been going out for? My mother told me never to count by seconds in paradise. That's very funny but seriously. I think we've been going out a little over six months, Right? Wait, you're not gonna get heavy on me, are you? The sun's out, it's a beautiful morning. Why don't you ever talk about your old boyfriends? Because that's why they call them 'old boyfriends.' Now, I've talked about my ex wife before, but you, not even a brief mention of your romantic past. Same story as everyone else. What's the point of discussing the past, hm? What are you gonna get? I think the fish cakes are good here. What's the longest relationship you've ever been in? Come on, really? It's a simple question. Here, I'll go first. My longest relationship was with my ex wife Valentina. We dated for three years, married for two. Then we got divorced. We didn't have any kids and we're still friendly. Now wasn't that simple? I'm not really in the mood for this. What if I don't wanna tell you? Did you ever think about that? What are you so afraid of? Maybe I just don't wanna talk about it. Listen, we share our time together. We share a bed. But we also need to share our feelings. I think I've held up my end of that bargain pretty well. Okay, fine. My longest relationship. I dated a man named Sebastian for a little over two years and then we broke up. That was my longest relationship. You happy? I think I'm gonna get the granola pancakes. What about you? Why did it end? Thom. Why is it so difficult for you to talk about? Look, it ended the way they all do. How did it end with your ex wife? We had differing opinions on the subject of kids. And you? If you really wanna know, he had mental health issues. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, I'm glad you're sorry. Well, how'd it start? I guess he knew he had problems, but I was so intoxicated in the initial throes of love, you force yourself to forget about them. And like most women in that situation, you tell yourself, oh I'm gonna be the one to help him get through it. My love is so strong. We're gonna get through this together. Et cetera, et cetera. And then by the time I realized that was all bullshit, I was in so deep, it was that much harder to leave him. What did you do? Everything I could think of. I tried love, kindness, cruelty. Ignoring it, smothering him. Anything and everything. The effect was always the same. Nothing. The really hard part was we both knew we were a perfect match for each other. It was obvious to anyone who was in the same room as us, but his illness was just bigger and stronger than both of us. Did you ever think that you were gonna get married? Yeah, of course. It was inevitable. But over the course of the two years, the strain of his health issues, the stress. We deteriorated. And now here we are. Me and you, still waiting to order. I'm sorry. I really am. I can't imagine how tough that must've been for you. Thank you for sharing that with me. I've seen a side of you I've been hoping to see for awhile now. Oh. Hi. The lady will have the granola pancakes. I'll have the quiche. Two side orders of fish cakes and a pot of white tea. This sure is some view, isn't it? Mm hm. What made you pick this spot over downtown? I was born and raised in the west end. Met Henrietta at that high school down the street. Kissed my first boy in that park. And you never felt the need for a change of scenery? I lived downtown for six months once. Just wasn't me. Why not? I don't know. It's just something about this neighborhood. Is it the neighborhood or is it you? Sometimes it's hard to separate the two. This is coming from a guy who changes cities every year. Believe me, if I find something I like, you'll be the first to know. You do have to admit it though, it is beautiful here. She used to be quite successful before she started to lose it. Any idea why? Apparently she was paranoid about people ripping off her ideas. Tricking her out of money. Never spoken to her myself. Just the gossip I've heard. Whatever the true story is, it's too bad. So you don't think she did that? Well, in terms of the carve work and from the story you've told me, doesn't sound her style. What next? I paint. You, I don't know. Hey, don't forget about Sunday morning, okay? What, this Sunday? I can't. I told you a week ago. It's my mom's birthday and we're getting together. But I have to hang out with Athena. I haven't seen her in a month. She's having boy problems. Well you can do it another day. I keep brushing her off. Just, I don't know apologize to her. Tell her we'll drop by for tea next Sunday. You can reschedule on me, but you do not reschedule on my mother. Are we clear? Are we a little grumpy this morning? Sunday morning, 10:00 a.m. Be ready. Are you giving me an ultimatum? Hi, sorry. Sorry, I know it's late. No, I'm fine. I just, don't really wanna sleep alone tonight. How long will it take you to get here? 'Kay. Is everything okay? Yeah. Just happy you're here. Thank you. You know, I still don't understand why I can't get an extra key. You don't need one. Come to bed with me? Tell me what happened. Hey, come on. I'm sleeping. What the hell was that for? Turn it off. I'm sleeping. I want you to tell me why I'm here. I wanted to see you. Isn't that enough? But you called me crying. Just let it go. Come back to bed. Just. Florrie, I am crazy about you, but I don't deserve this, all right, you call me in the middle of the night crying and you don't expect me to ask what's going on? Stop being so dramatic. Still. Still you won't tell me. Now, I wanna be clear, all right. I wanna be loved. Now, if you don't want that or you can't handle it, it's, I don't know. Just call me later in the week if you wanna talk. Matt. Please give me a kiss before you go. You know where to find me. Doesn't look like you're ready. Do you want me to make you tea or something? You know I was coming to pick you up this morning. Why aren't you ready? I thought we had this discussion. You're right, we had it. So put on your clothes and let's go. I told you, I had plans. You're sitting around your apartment doing nothing. Don't tell me you have plans. You know what? I don't have to answer to you. You're right. You don't have to answer to me because for starters you don't give a shit about me. You know what? Just watch yourself here. And why am I wasting my time with someone that doesn't give a shit about me? You know what? Forget about me for a second. What about my mother? You don't even have the courage to make her happy. I told you I was busy. Who the fuck are you to talk to me like that? This whole time I accepted your secretive nature. I figured you were more sensitive than what you led on, but hey, you're not sensitive at all. You're just plain selfish. Okay, well good morning to you, too. I hope you find what you're looking for. Good luck. You've looked better. Pretty good to begin with. Works for most people right? If they want you, who are you to criticize? Still. What are they thinking? Guess everybody has something, right? But what do I really care about somebody's something and what do they really care about mine? They're the same. They all do the same. And who are they to think they're better than me? How are we so different 'cause you know what? I don't really see it. Don't really see it. Just let me live my life and I'll let you live yours. Hey Thompson. How much longer do you have? Oh, you left early? No, I was just wondering if you wanted to get together and go for a drive. We could maybe hit the beach. Right, yeah, no. I completely understand. Work is work. Yeah. See ya. Why don't you just show your face? What are you hiding? Hey Buster. Yup. Quite a relic you got there. Remington 823. Same one Burroughs used to write "Naked Lunch". Now that you mention it, I am kind of hungry. What are you working on? Confessions Of A Love Junkie. Sounds daunting. Mind if I read a page? You can read this. When you're done, please put it back. Yeah. I was never a match for you. You gave your words everything. You gave them your heart, your mind, your soul, your life. I gave you syphilis. You gave me art and passion and fidelity. I gave you betrayal and heartache and sorrow. You held nothing back. Now there's nothing left, is there? Is the simple life of ease you dreamed of, fiction or fantasy? Can't be true. If true of some, then not for you. You contained multitudes. I couldn't bare to see you pruned to a single stalk. I hope for more. Hope is not a method my darling word machine. We were young. Outside of time we are still hugging and shaking in the rain forever. You loved me. I loved the idea of you. I let you go. I did the right thing for the wrong reasons. A quarter of a century has passed and I see that now. I feel the truth of it. I wish I could've left you better than I found you. I was always too much and I will always be not enough. I still believe you exist. You are released from, I am forgotten. I was never there and you were always so painfully present. I'll try not to breathe. I was never a match for you. I don't know what to say. Can you please put it back on the pile? I don't understand. You're gonna be okay, I promise. Florrie, do you have any idea what time it is? Do I break people? Oh my god. Oh my god. I love you, come on. I don't know. Things are generally pretty good. Happy. Keeping busy. Work is... Work is work. No one believes me though when I tell them I'm okay. I know, they're worried about me. Henrietta is really worried about me, which makes me worried about her. My mom won't shut up about me talking to a therapist, so I stopped talking to her. I know, I'm gonna talk to her again. Just gonna let her stew for a little while. You know things are... things are good. I'm happy. It's only like every once in awhile just something really small will set me off. Like, I can be walking down Bloor, Really happy, having a great day and then I'll see, like a young couple together and I'll just hate them. It'll totally fuck up my day. Which is stupid because I don't even... I don't even want that anymore. You know? Or if like if someone brings you up and I'm not ready for it especially because they always these stupid Hallmark things like 'oh he would've wanted you to be happy'. All I can think is no. You would've... You would've wanted me to be one of those like Italian widows who wears black for 80 years and then gets married, buried next to you, but like in a romantic way I guess. Things are... Things are good. Things are pretty much the same. The only difference is that you're not here. To be honest I think you'd be really disappointed, there are still no flying cars. There are hover boards though.
