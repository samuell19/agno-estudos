?Russkaya Ruletka? and " ParisMedia" with CNC and Canal+? a film by Andrei Konchalovksy Ryaba My Chicken Inna Churikova - Asya Aleksandr Surin - Stepan Gennady Yegorychev - Chirkunov and others That?s fine. That?s fine. Eggs! Not ordinary, but dietetic ones! Not one, but six dozen! Well, who is brave? Who is brave? Come on! Eggs, nice and fresh! Eggs! Who is brave? Excuse me, how much are your eggs? One egg is 30 rubles. 30 rubles? 30 rubles. 30 rubles for one egg? Are you deaf or something? Sonia! Come here! The eggs here are practically free! One, minute! One minute! One minute! I was here first... What is this? You?re selling at this price? Are you daft? Everyone?s eggs cost 100. Get lost weirdo, don?t distract me from selling! Are you ill, dropping the prices like this? You need to be treated! I?m gonna treat you in a bit! I?m gonna treat you so much you?re going to be going to the doctor for the rest of your life! How many do you want? Three dozen, please. I said - not a single one! Not a single one! Nobody gets anything! I?m buying it all! I was first in the queue. Here, here, here! Is that enough? Sonia, give me the money, the eggs are disappearing! Here, here! Get lost! Everything is bought! Everything is bought for 700. I said get lost! Take the change. I?m going to call the police now! Here! If I see you lowering the prices one more time, I?m gonna kill you! Tophik, Rustam, come here! Yes, what was I saying? Ah, yes. About democracy. Well, what is this then, comrades? Excuse me, please. Gentlemen, you?re just gentlemen now. Well, in your opinion, gentlemen, what is this? What, did we not have democracy? We had democracy, yes, yes. Like this was our democracy. They say: free market. But where is this freedom, if you can?t sell at your own price?! Now under Brezhnev, we really had a free market. You could sell for however much you want. There was cleanliness. There was order. If you spat somewhere, a policeman will come, with a whistle, make you pay a fine! And you pay, what else is there to do, you pay. And nowadays they can whistle or not, nobody is afraid anymore. And the market, you can?t even enter the market. It?s terrifying. There?s dirt everywhere! Vomit! Because there?s drunkenness! Drunkenness everywhere. Thieves. My Sonia prepared some tubs of gherkins, prepared them to be taken to the market. She comes back. With a bag full of money. And what? They slashed it with a razor and fucking stole everything. Thieves! Where there is no fear. There is no order. And what is democracy without order? Democracy is good when there is order So it works out that you can?t live without fear! Excuse me, please. I would like to ask. Who exactly are these, these gentlemen? Where are they? Where, where? They just aren?t anywhere! Oh, it?s those ones? The ones in the Mercedes. Those swindlers, yes. But that?s not a democracy. That?s a mess, you understand? Oh! Oh! My little one. Who?s that running there? It?s my little one running! Protect your heart, my good one. I sold your eggs. Bought some sugar. ??? ??? We?ll invite everyone! Asya! Look what a machine I bought, I?ll make wooden planks for the whole village now . Go choke on your planks. Asya, where were you? Where did you go missing? What?s it to you. Aunt Asya, give us a candy. What for? Go home. Go home. Go home. I said so! Go home, go! Where are you going? Go away! I?m sitting here worrying about you. Thinking you got hit by a train or by a car. Or, god forbid, some racketeers robbed you, you think it?s good for my nerves? Listen now! What nerves?! I don?t know for what reason, but get lost. Calm down, calm down I said! Calm down! I?ll help you with the bags. Why are they lying around here? Drink! This is not the case, Asya! Yes it is. Drink and get out of here! Why don?t you respect me at all, Asya? You?re not gonna drink? Relax! Aunt Asya, don?t give daddy to drink! Aunt Asya! You don?t have any sympathy, Asya. No sympathy at all. You don?t have any conscience! Go away! I?m all nervous, you see, I?m over-worried. And you don?t care. Look at this sufferer! What? Have you blistered your foot again? Well, there was no bus. Listen, did you see our Sergey in town? What? Our son, you didn?t see him incidentally? You what? You don?t remember that he?s in the oblast, not in the region? Shame. Why is it a shame to you? It?s a shame that you didn?t see our son. You have? another dozen running around. Asya, don?t pretend. You don?t love anyone but me. I know it. Fill me another glass. Here it is, your love. Sit. I?ll bring it. You?re my punishment from God! What, you can?t fill it up properly? I know your limit. Who are you? Who is who? It begins? Don?t avoid my question. Who are you? Maybe a woman? I?m the chicken?s friend. You have chicken brains! Is it possible that a normal woman would throw out out the only photo of her son into the street? Well? What else will you say? Speak. With regards to the woman, I don?t have anymore questions for her. And it doesn?t concern anyone. An old lame woman who sells moonshine. Esp- especially? Giving close ones and relatives to drink. Giving everyone to drink. Fuck! What is this, a woman? Yes? Answer me, my dear! I?ll show you? Stop it! I?ll rip your head off! Get your stuff and leave! I don?t want to see you again! You won?t, you won?t! Get out. I said, get out! Ryabochka. Why do I get all this? On this unpleasant day, why am I so happy. I am playing my accordion in front of passers-by. Unfortunately, a birthday is only once a year. Unfortuna? You?re gonna get it now! Don?t you dare! Don?t you dare! You bastard, what is this? Alcoholic, you should go to jail, you?d become a person there. Are you crazy? Hi, guys! Hi! Scolding you again? Crazy.. My wife died. No, Maria, I don?t like it like this. Why don?t you like it? You?re just dragging dirt from side to side. I told you to take a vacuum cleaner. What do I need your vacuum cleaner for? I?ve been washing the floor with a cloth my whole life. Exactly. Smeared up the whole floor. And now you need to wait for it to dry. And you still need to vacuum the curtains. And the carpet? You?re gonna do it with a mop? I?m not gonna be done until the morning! If you wanna get paid, you?ll manage. in? the street? Lyudka, why are you bothering her? I?m gonna smack you in the head! What?s this? My dear, my dear, my good one. Good, good. My good one. ?the young shepherd sang? Get out, you?re gonna get a cold. Haha, you won?t reach me! Get out, I tell you! And then I?ll have to treat you, like a madwoman. I?d rather die than live with a snake like that! Ryabochka, let?s go inside! Ryabocka, keep up! ?the day is nasty ... ?can?t go to the field? ?can?t work in the field? Come one, pour some? can?t work in the field? Wait, wait a second. I?m tired! Why are you tired? The potatoes have long been harvested. Were you tidying up the alotment? I was tidying up at Chirkunov?s. He called me to clean his house. Oh Lord, I?ll tell you? It?s like I was abroad. He?s fastidious, god forbid. This is wrong, that is wrong. Use the vacuum instead of the cloth. But the vacuum is so loud! I?m scared that I?ll get an electric shock from it! And his house, you know how it is, he has 12 rooms! Try to clean that! I heard that he has a TV in every room. Not in every, but I counted four. What a bastard. He said his kitchen is all mechanised. For sure. I?ve never seen such machinery. One washes the dishes. Another one washes clothes and dries them. Third one makes coffee every hour, and the fourth - the bread just jumps out right into your hands. And the bathroom, all with tiles, with flowers, And the floor is warm. You can go and walk barefoot! Cleanliness, beauty. Like in church! It?s all on purpose. It?s all just to anger us, to undermine us. Well, and how much did he pay you? How much did he pay you, when you betrayed us? We all decided at the general meeting that nobody would be going to Chirkunov. Am I right? That?s right. So, how much did he pay you? Ten dollars. Here. Please. How much is that in ours? 13,500. Well, what will you say? Who are you? Who is who? You sold yourself to Chirkunov for 20 dollars, yes? What?s wrong with you? Tear it apart! Absolutely not! Tear it apart in front of everyone. If you?re so jealous, choke on it! Is she wearing pants, what do you think? It?s winter outside!. Oh and you?re drinking vodka here, striped devils. And why did Maria fly out of here head hung low? She?s crying like a calf. Did you insult her? Ah, gambling for currency. Smells of report. Ok, ok. It?s the kolkhoz?s, don?t touch it. Take it. Take it, it?s for you, Misha. Thank you. To your health! Chirkunov turned on his factory. Sawing those planks, fucker! All to spite us! Will he let us sleep or not? The man?s working. Got himself a second machine. And you, pathetic alcoholic, don?t know how to work or how to steal. Just how to stuff yourself! That?s all! You can?t live like that! We?ve lost Russia! No, you can go crazy like this! Stay home! Asya, what are we going to do? To the chairman! When is this going to end?! Chairman! Oh, a delegation. Did you hear? What is this? I?m not deaf, I heard. What is this disorder? What am I to do. I wasn?t sleeping, just like everyone. Why are you screaming? Tell him that there is to be no noise after 11! These are the rules of the socialist community! What are you talking about!? What socialists!? What are you on about? That?s for towns. Here is the countryside. And what, people in the country aren?t people? Some kind of chairman you are! I can?t do anything, you spoiled him yourself! When will this end? Now, Ryabochka. I?m gonna show them now! Asya, where are you going? Is there some celebration? Going demonstrating to Chirkunov. I?ll come with you! What use is there from you? Valya, let?s go! Let?s go! Why are you bringing him? You don?t like him? Why did you bring Gorbachev! I don?t have a different one! Men, let?s go beat Chirkunov! Quiet, quiet, to the right, to the right. Watch out, don?t let if fall over. Stop! Stop! Stop! With this end. Bring it here. What?s this? What is this party? Where are you going? We?re going to beat Chirkunov! Not beat, but demonstrate. You didn?t warn me, Asya. Why would I warn you? What do you mean why would you warn me? Such an event! You understand? And without me. What even is that? It doesn?t matter. So? Wait, stop, idiots! Wait. Listen here, don?t start without me! I?m gonna gather everyone and bring the radio booth. That?s all! The gates are the most important! We?ll start there. It?s important to not let him put himself together! Me first! Stop the music. I said, cut out the music! Dear comrades, kolkhozniks and peasants the time has come to raise our voices in defence of an ordinary worker and say a decisive ?No!?. Are you gonna cut the music or not, I told you! So that not a single fake sheep in our friendly herd, didn?t stop us from living and working not by the animalistic laws of capitalism but by our, humanistic ones, as we are used to. On this note, I give the word to our activist, Asya Ivanovna Klyachina. Honourable kolkhozniks! Not gentlemen, but kolkhozniks. Because we took care of the gentlemen in 1917, as you know. But they raise their necks again. And again we have to tell them a decisive ?No!?. Vasily Nikitich said it correctly, that, in our herd, that, he, he is well, a disgrace. Disgrace! Disgrace! Disgrace! Asya, why am I a disgrace? You have the guts to come here and ask why you are a disgrace? Because you prevent us from living. We?ve had enough of these speculators, these businessmen, and cooperators and all the other mafia of the free market! Get out of our village! Out! What did I disturb you with? With what? Just because I work hard? You don?t let us sleep. I?m gonna fucking kill you! I don?t let you sleep! Correct. That?s true. I don?t let you sleep . Excuse me please, comrades! He?s mocking us. He?s mocking the people. Shameless. You?re making fun of yourselves. What did you come here for? Why did you bring a poster with that image here? You want to surprise me? No, you?re not going to surprise me. Here?s where I have these portraits! You see? Here they are. I worked hard for them already, and now I?m going to work for myself. Understood? Nobody?s gonna get me out. And whoever tries to, we will shoot! Are you waiting for smoke sausage to fall from the sky? It?s not going to fall. You were waiting for Gorbachev, you waited for Yeltsin. You didn?t wait up! And you won?t! You have to work! Instead of dragging around your posters. You?ll go to Asya Klyachina. You?ll have a glass of, a glass of moonshine and ?let?s go?. So that?s how you think of the common people! I don?t respect the people? We?ll see. Guys, open the gate. Open them up! Comrades, enter! Treat yourselves! Don?t be shy. Come on, come on! A bottle for everyone! It?s compensation for your sleepless nights. Free of charge! Free of charge, come in! Stop, don?t enter! Stop, stop, stop! Don?t listen to him, this is a provocation! Don?t even think about it! Stop! Where are you going? Stop, stop. Where are you going, old-timer? Where are you going! Provocation! Go at least and take a couple bottles, before they take everything! Greetings, workers! Hello, hello. It?s 11pm, time to switch it off. Wait a moment, we?ll pass the last sheaf and it?s finished. You don?t want to come in? What haven?t I already seen there? You?ve only seen it in pictures. You know what kind of kitchen I?ve had constructed? A beauty. Come on, let?s have a look! Come, come! Come! Look how it works. You see what it?s like? Not bad! Here?s my kitchen. And this is the dining room. And for you? I haven?t been drinking for four years. Oh, well done then! Nice sausage. Where?d you get it? It drops from the sky! I don?t understand what they dislike you for. To tell the truth, I don?t understand either. When I came to live in the village, they gave me this land. I thought? we?ll live peacefully. Maybe they?re jealous? What?s there to be jealous of? You can work. Even at night. And they, they can?t? You?re wondering, in Germany, for example, or even in Estonia everyone lives like that. That?s in Germany. Our people aren?t like that. Haha! People! And I, am I not the people? Am I not? Am I not? Haha! I?d need to think. Let?s have another. Show me the warm floor in the bathroom! Let?s go and I?ll show you, come on, come one. You?ve built it all up! Close the door! So, my darling, are you gonna extinguish it yourself or should I call the police? So, arrested on the scene of the crime. Article 149, point two. Arson of private property. Or this one! The 207th. Arson with intention of murder. Arrest me! ?two little pieces of sausage? ?were lying on the table? Mother! Where are you? I could get a heart attack! Go home! How many times do I have to repeat? You want a stone thrown at you!? Bitch! Senya! Senya! Son! I?m here! Oh fuck! Fuck, I?ve dropped through! Senya, Senya, where are you? Here! Did you break through or something? No, I went here myself. Help me get out! Give me your hand. Come on, come on. Fuck. We?ll, I?ve arrived. I just bought these shoes! So what, shoes, I?ll pull them out. Fuck! What are you doing? Build a proper toilet! You say that for nothing. A toilet is a toilet. 300,000, you understand? 300? Here! Why are you throwing around 300,000, are you crazy? Senya, what are you doing my son? This is big money, I?ll wash them and they?ll be, as good as new. Look, what a nice wallet! What?s up with you? Take the wallet. What? And the money as well? Take all the money. Everything! Mother is also? too lazy to install some new planks. Where is she?! Where is she?! Where is she hanging around? Fuck! She tried to set fire to Chirkunov. And they caught her, the idiot! Set fire? What for? What for? For everything. She should get five years, the old fool. She?d calm down a bit! Who touched my trousers? What is this? Huh? I?m asking you! Probably mother. What is this, huh? The trousers are fine. That?s what I get for coming! Got into shit straight away! What am I gonna put on my feet? Huh? Nothing but galoshes! 30. Aha! Freedom for Asya, freedom! She?s innocent! She didn?t set fire to anything! We?re not going to leave until you free her! We?ll, let?s say you did the right thing. But you still violated the law. That?s interesting. And he didn?t violate it? We?ll deal with him ourselves. We?ll fine you, and let you go. I?m not going anywhere! How so? Just like that! Let them judge me! I?m not leaving without a trial! Asya, there?s a crowd out there! The situation is bad. Don?t make it worse! I have to! Let the regional judge come here. Let the TV come here, Ostankino. I?ll explain everything to them, who favours the exploiters, and gives them freedom. And who may that be? Who gave Chirkunov the land? I did. How was I to know what he would do with it? I shut off his electricity, he installed a Diesel. I shut off his water, and he drilled a well. You shouldn?t have given him the land. The land has to be given. There?s a new law. You know this, Asya! Who respects the law nowadays? That?s it, enough chatter! I?ve had enough! Get out! Open the door! It?s open! I tried to get her out of here all night long! Hey, where are you going! Get out! Asya! I love you! I?m not going anywhere! I?m not going anywhere! I?m not going anywhere! Stay there! I will marry you after! Let?s go! Let?s get out of here! Grisha, where are you? Where are you? Use force! If she doesn?t understand human language, we?ll have to use force. Go! Asya! Asya, leave please! Ah! Fuck! What did I tell you? Madam! Madness! Why are you standing around her? Let me get through! Your mother?s a hero! What hero?! We?re not gonna let her get harmed! You?ve got problems? Your mother?s a bit? I got it, how much? I?ll pay you myself. Just get her out of here. Hey, are you ill? It?s your mother? almost tore my ass off, bitch! I recognise family, hi! Long time no see! Who wore out my tracksuit? Look what I?m walking around in. Alright, get up, let?s get out of here. What?s that stench? That? That?s shit. I fell into your shit. Your planks are all rotten. Get up, let?s go. Don?t come here if you don?t like it. Nobody invited you. Get out, thug. Stop it. I only came here for half an hour. Let?s go, we?ll talk at home. I have nothing to say to a thief! Mother, what?s up with you? Nothing. I?m not your mother. You?re not a son to me! What are you saying? Everyone will hear. What about them? Let them hear. I have nothing to be ashamed of. My conscience is clear. Unlike yours. You think nobody knows what you get up to in town? Hey, mother, it?s no longer just the communists who can steal! Nowadays everyone can steal! And me, I steal because it?s a democracy. You understand? Serega! Son! My whole life I didn?t take a penny. Not a penny. You understand? I didn?t take a penny. I didn?t steal anything. That?s your problem, you fool. What did you just say? I said you?re an idiot! Cool it! Have you gone insane? Open it! I?m gonna kill you! Open it! You?ve gone insane! I?m gonna kill you! I?ve had enough! Come here! I?ll tell you everything! Lift her up! Come here! Son! Son! A photo to remember! A photo to remember! Attention, a photo to remember! Ready! Attention! Smile! Come on, smile! Ready! Hillbillies! It?s as if all of you had just climbed down from the trees! You?ve been shitting in a hole for 400 years, and you?ll keep doing it for another 400! You understand or not? And you, you? You?re not a mother to me! I don?t need one like that! Good, calmly. What?s that, caramel? 2,000. One box. What?s that? Sticks? 1,500. One box. What?s that, coffee? Ecuador. 2,000. Five jars. No, give me ten jars. And vodka. 1,870. One box. Do you even have enough money? I have enough. Smells like shit. Does money smell? Where?d you get so much money? Serenka gave it to me. My dear son. Hey! What?s going on? Help me out lads, my woman just gave birth. At night. Where is she? In the ravine! At night! Help me, lads! I was so afraid, brothers, so afraid. I?m driving, and my woman, that fool, starts giving birth. I say: What?s going on? She says: I?m going to give birth. So she?s going to the bushes. And I?m going after her. Later I come again. Lost a seat from the car. And she?s run away somewhere. Son. My son. My dear son. Well, lads, that?s how it went. 127,700. Huh? Are you taking it? The money?s stolen! You wish you had a son like that! It?s all the same as before here? No changes? All the old stuff stayed as it was? What am I supposed to change? Why did you come? I just came for a minute. I have a job for you. My house needs cleaning. You what? Drunk or something? I don?t drink at all! You know how many rooms there are? And there?s nobody to clean them. I have a vacuum cleaner. I?ll pay you well! You what? Have you gone nuts? Does Maria not clean well enough? She left. Maria isn?t there anymore. She said: Asya shamed me. They don?t let me walk in the street. She?s ashamed. She?s ashamed, so she stays at home. None of us is going to come to you. Fuck ?em. I need you. Remove your hand. Sorry. Asya. Marry me, I?m asking you for the last time. Last time, last time, how many last times are there? This is the very last? I bought three colour TVs, come to me. Asya! Asya. I bought myself a second car. What car? Zhiguli. You think that? you buy yourself some cars, and I?ll come running to you? I care just about material things? Material things are also from God. You work well, and God gives you more material things. I? want to properly live finally. I want you to live properly. I feel sorry for you, get it? Time?s passing, you fool! Look at this, my friend. Just look. I almost burned him down. And he? Maybe he really loves me, huh? What? He?s strong, he?s a strong one. It?s for him to be a grandfather. He?s almost 60 but he just keeps going. He proposes to me for the fourth time. What does he see in me? You?re a prostitute, Asya. A prostitute. Pretending like you?re a virgin. Isn?t it nice when someone gives you attention? Even if it?s a speculant, even if it?s a racketeer. It?s all nice. ?the soot collects like a tear? Where have you been? Asya, marry me? Marry me! Marry me! Marry me, Asya! You named him already? Yes. Could?ve asked me! Tell me, what happened to people? We used to work in the kolkhoz from morning to evening, you understand? For free. Three roubles a day. How did we work? Happily, joyfully, singing songs. And why? Because we knew: there is no money, and there won?t be any. But now, money is in packs like this. And everyone?s dissatisfied. Why? Because of private property. They allowed it! So is Serenka, my son. As soon as he came back from the army, he went to the town chasing big money. He?s a good boy. Very good. He? How did all this begin? With perestroika. With glasnost. With Gorbachev. With Mikhail Sergeyevich. And what did they change with this perestroika? There?s no order, no intelligence, no conscience. Nothing. Nothing?s left. Look at the TV. Look. It?s about us. I started drinking because of this Gorbachev! And how can you not drink? If it?s a brothel all around? He used to be a speculant. Now he?s a businessman. And Serenka. Ah! Serenka? Also got tied up with these criminals, idiot! It?s your fault! What? I said it?s your fault! I see. And why?s that? Should?ve left him in the kolkhoz. Shouldn?t have let him go to town! How?s that, in the kolkhoz? He?d be drinking even more here. And there he became a thug. Is that better? Fuck off. You became too clever! No rudeness please! No rudeness! Oh God! Why did you have the abortion, huh? It?s a sin. What else could I have done. I?m alone! She?s alone! But she didn?t go for Stepan. Look what?s become of him! Have a look! You?re too picky! Pride is a sin. And Chirkunov? Huh? And what, Chirkunov? The whole village hates him. He can?t live in the village. Envy is a sin. What?s envy got to do with it? Your envious! You envy everything! And are too afraid to admit it to yourselves. Stay alone! Old idiot! Ryaba! Where?d you go? Hell knows? Oh! What is that? Oh god. Where?s the wall? They stole it Look at these hooligans! What the fuck do you need a wall for? It?s all rotten! Oh... Oh, God. What?s that? Oh lord, they messed up the barn quite badly? I know who did that! Chirkunov, the bloody pest. That damned devil was driving around in his car all night long! What are you hiding there? Where? There, there, there, in your hand? Something?s glistening in your hand. What is there? Look! Look! Give it to me I?m telling you! Ok, wait. Calm down, calm down! Give me your hand! Ok? Calm down and take a look. Oh god. An egg! An egg. Heavy! Heavy! Must be golden. Yeah, yeah. Look how it glitters! Did Ryaba lay it? Well it wasn?t me! Listen, Asya. It?s a miracle. What? I?m telling you - a miracle! What are you telling me? We had an intercession at night. What?s with you? Open your eyes! Why are you holding it? Give it to me. What do you need it for? Are you crazy? Give me the egg! Here, choke on it! You and your egg. There you go! Hide it well, or it will be stolen. All golden? And you don?t tell anyone what you saw. I?m silent! I?ll be silent. The whole village will find out immediately! So, the business regarding the egg. Who would like to say something? Ok, ok. I will speak. I will say my personal opinion. I propose the egg to be considered communal property belonging to the whole kolkhoz! That?s right! Bravo! I invite you to vote. Who is for selling the egg? Ok. Asya, did you abstain? I?m reflecting on it, thinking. She has the right. Write it down in the minutes. Now for the second, who is Chirkunov for us? He?s a bastard! He?s a traitor! Put him up against a wall! So. We will buy off all of his property and be done with this cancer once and for all. Correct? Correct! Listen to me. We must sell the egg. And split up the profits by the number of heads in each family. Me, I have nine heads in the family. Nine heads, but you?ll drink it all alone. He doesn?t drink. That doesn?t concern you! Why are you meddling? Why are you meddling, huh? He doesn?t drink. You shut up, you thief! You?re the thief! No, you?re the thief! Mama! Brothers! Brothers and sister! You forgot about the church! Give the money to the church! Listen, confessor Nikodim, we already gave you money for the church. You did, you did! You gave, but do you know what the prices are like nowadays? The money ? nothing happened with it. Nikitin, hey, Nikitin! ?party here and there? I?ll kill you! Silence! Are you people or what? We?ll never agree on anything like this. Let?s decide about Chirkunov, ok? How can I talk with you? Now, where were we? You?ve mixed everything up. Regarding Chirkunov, we must remember. What?s first? The first part of the money we use to buy out his property. So the egg isn?t a miracle, but a goldmine. I would like to understand. Well and what?s the problem? Well, I thought it was a miracle. But you?ve changed my opinion. Thank you! Where are you going? Thank you. Home. To feed Ryaba. You?ve smoked the whole place up. She?ll die here. Stop her! Let me through. Did you hear what the people decided? I heard. I heard. You will leave the egg to administration for my receipt! Where did you find the egg? Asya, I have a bad heart, as you know, I beg you. In the barn. And whose barn is it? Citizen Klyachina! It?s MY barn. Subsequently, the egg is mine! Well, not really mine, but my great-grandfather?s. Your grandfather?s a thief. My grandfather was Ivan Vasilievich, my grandfather was rich. Traveled on steamboats. You know how to live on others? merits. Am I right? Right! They were up to no good their whole lives! A boat into your mouths and a steamboat up your ass! You?re right Asya, it?s our egg! Move! Move! It?s our egg. From the grandfather, the grandfather, the captain. And we also have Serenka! Asya. Listen, Asya. Did you find anything else in the barn? Just one egg? What?s it to you? We should look again. Definitely look again. Maybe we?ll find something else. A little golden cauldron, for example? Go dig in your own barn with your gypsy. You?re a bitch, Asya. A grabber! Do you have a conscience? I was the only one who supported you at the meeting! Our time has come, Pavel Vasilievich Klyachin. What do you want, huh? Sasha Chirkunov. Sergeevich, it?s for you! Hi, Sasha! Please, enter. I?ve been waiting for you for a while! Let?s go, darling, let?s go. Let?s go, I?ll show you the house! Get your hands off! Please! Go peck some of the good farm stuff. There?s loads of it. Will you have a shot? If you can spare it. Anything for you. That?s my dishwasher. Washes everything itself, you don?t need to do anything. You just press the button and that?s it. It washes and dries. You put dirty plates in and take clean and dry ones out. What?s that? Tile or something? It?s Finnish lino. Not bad, huh? And what?s that? It?s a coffee maker. And that, what?s that? An iron? That?s a toaster! To fry bread. Hey, Fedya! Where are you loading that, huh? I told you to do put it behind the barn! Are you not hot? Huh? Hands off! That?s it, that?s it! No hands, you got it? I give up, I give up, I give up. Calm down, Asya. What is this imported shit. Doesn?t work at all. Please, have some more! Pour some more. I will. You think I won?t. I?ll have some more. I have a proposition for you. Have you heard about the egg? So it?s true? I didn?t believe it. Can I touch it? Touch. What a beauty! What do you think, how much is it worth? Three million? I don?t know. It?s an antique. Gold. Maybe 20, or even 100. 100? That?s probably too much. Asya, I don?t know exactly. You need a specialist. 100 million. What are you going to do with so much money? How much does your house cost? 20 million. Will you show me the toilet? Why are all of you so attracted to my toilet? I?m sick of going to a hole! Even my Serenka says so! Is it with a flush? Of course! You know what my house will be like? I will have such a house? A house like this! You remember my alotment? It goes out to the river. I will build such greenhouses there! My greenhouses will be like this! I will have cucumbers. I will have tomatoes. What greenhouses, you fool! You can buy a three-masted steamboat for that money! Like Mikhail Kalinin. Something like that. You?ll buy a steamboat. You will name it after your grandfather or your great-grandfather, what?s his name? Ivan Vasilievich Klyachin? That?s right! My own steamboat? Mhm. Then you need to build a pier! So what? A pier needs a restaurant. It?ll need a disco. Now your head started working! Well done, girl! Well done, woman! How else? There?s always problems with builders. They?ll steal everything. Get some builders from the town. Alright. The egg will stay with you. I?m afraid they?ll steal it from me. And you, lend me some money. How much do you need? How much? I need to buy sugar to make a tank of moonshine. I?ll put it out in the street, and they?ll drink! Until they die. You need two tons of sugar for that. Yes, you need two tons. And also transportation. Do you have? Is Fedya your driver? Yes, I have a Fedya. What beauty! My beloved lands? ?oh how I used to be? ?and what I have become! Did you see? She?s driving in Chirkunov?s car! You see, money likes to be counted. Yep. Listen, Asya! My starter stopped working. Can you tow me to the village? Huh? I have the rope. Ok, ok, hook yourself up! Listen, Asya, I?ll be right back! Alright. Alright. Thank you! Why did you only give me small change? If you don?t like it I?ll.. No! No! No! No, no! Hey! Where?s my driver? He?s finishing his drink. Oh accountant, my dear accountant. That?s how he is, so simple. Accountant. You what? You what, huh? You?ll drive the car in such a state? It?s a country road. There?s no cops. All?s well. Please, to the cabin. No. I?ll ride in the back. Got it? Pissed everywhere? She won?t get hurt? It?s only half a metre deep. At least we?ll build a new bridge out of Chirkunov?s pocket, made from concrete! What if Chirkunov refuses to pay? He won?t have a choice. It?s his car. And the bridge is ours! Alright, go! Petya, go faster, everyone?s waiting. Calm down, comrades! The punishment approaches! Our cause is just! We will defeat them! Oh fuck. Give me your hand! Pull me up, fuck! Pull me up! One sec. You see, the traitors get the punishment they deserve! Why are you laughing? You?re laughing at yourselves! You?re laughing at yourselves! At yourselves! Devils! Where?s the egg? Where?s the egg? Fucking bitches. I?m asking you, where is the egg? What egg? A golden one! I hid it here yesterday. Hid it? So it?s a treasure. What treasure? It?s egg from the Hermitage. It costs one and a half million. You understand? They write about it in the books. Where is it? It?s stolen? What difference does it make? Where is it? I sold it! To whom? To one guy. For a truckload of sugar. For a truck. That?s it. This is definitely the end for me. Now I?ll be killed for sure. Who?s gonna kill you? Who? There are some! What right do they have. Mummy, you know they have the right to do anything. They?re not joking around. Are you serious? I?m joking! You see how I?m laughing! This is definitely the end for me! Mummy,..hide me somewhere. Please. You know what. I?ll be different. I?ll change. Will you hide me somewhere? Will you put me somewhere? I beg you, please. I?ll hide you, my son. I?ll hide you! Please, hide me. I?ll hide you. I?ll hide you. Listen, shoot if you have to. Ok. Show me how. Look, like this. You take it like this, and then you press here. Ok, let me try. Let me try. You want to try right now? Yes, right now. First you?d better hide me and then try later. That?s right. Write two statements. What statements? Mother, what statements do I have to write? Write. Quick! Let?s put some newspaper down. So everything?s clean. Alright. Write. What statements am I writing? Which? One for the kolkhoz. Another for the party. Which party? To ours, the communist party, which one. Where are you going you idiot? Where are you going? Pregnant idiot. Climb down! Mummy, I wrote them. Yeah? Give it to me. That?s all? That?s all. Mommy! Don?t do it. Did you get dry? A little bit. So, what happened? Everything?s alright. I have a proposition for you. Let?s go to the house. Let?s go. Sasha! Give the egg back to me? The egg? What have you come up with now? I?ll repay my debts to you. I?ll work it all off. Generally speaking, we shouldn?t help Asya in her misfortune. She spat in the face of the kolkhoz. I don?t believe you, Asya. Me neither! Yes, we shouldn?t be helping her. If we were savages. But we?re humanists, comrades. The Soviet state brought us up. Here?s Serenka?s two statements. One for the kolkhoz, and another for the party. I apologise deeply, but, protect my son as a kolkhoznik and member of the candidates to become members of the party. Well, Klyachina, that?s quite a deed! But that?s our son, Serenka! Well done, Asya! Look, comrades, it?s my son, Serenka. His signature. Good. I give you the egg. Do with it whatever you want. Off! Can?t agree to anything with them! Silence, for fuck?s sake! I said silence! What?s our goal today? The acquisition of Chirkunov?s property. Will we rid ourselves of this pest or not? We must, we must. So why are you shouting then? So, we sell the egg. Split the profits. And who?s gonna do the time? You decided? The egg?s stolen. Article 208 point two of the Criminal Code. Assholes. How so, how is that? It won?t work like this. So, we must return the egg to the town. Get the car. They?ll shoot not just Serega because of that egg, but you as well, and throw some grenades through the windows. You don?t read the papers? They?ve got those, those? panzerfausts. They get through such thick armour. Like a tank?s. That?s how it is! So, who?s gonna bring it to the town, huh? Nope. Listen, chairman. What if we sell the egg to those racketeers, huh? Very good idea. Sell the egg. Buy out Chirkunov. Legalise it through the region, and let the ministry of internal affairs look for it. And we have nothing to do it. That?s right! Ah Ksenia! Oh, hi! Hello there. It hurts! Why are you weirdos carrying me. I can walk myself. Let go of me. You like carrying me? Where? You know what? I get here. I think - where to hide it? First, I think to hide it here. There?s milk here, we have goats! Put it here. There used to be a wall here. Wanted to bury it somewhere. But then I thought: if there?s mice, they might take it away? So I thought I?d better hide it up there, in the hay up there. You don?t believe me? I?ll show you. So? What?s up there? Truly. Asya, what?s going on there, Asya! Don?t worry, Dimitrich, I won?t hit you! Hello. I said hello. Who are you looking for? That hero there. That?s my son! Touching him is forbidden. You heard what I said? Fuck off outta here. Come on, mummy. We?re peaceful people. We?ll settle everything peacefully. We won?t even touch Serega. Give us that egg, and we leave. We won?t give it just like that. But we?ll gladly sell it. How much do you want? 100 million. 100 million and not a penny less. Cool! Not bad. Otherwise - war. We?re desperate people. We have everything. Uzi, shmuzi. Panzerfaust. Antitank. Alright. We need to report back. We?ll come back tonight. Quickly go to Chirkunov, and tell him: 50 million. If he sells it, he?ll save Serega. If he doesn?t, forgive me, all?s in your hands. Mhm. Right now. There she is. In time for dinner. Will you eat? What?s wrong, Asya. I came. I see that you came. But what?s up with you? You?re weird. Sell the house, Sasha. What? Your house, your property, sell everything. To you? No, to the kolkhoz. Where do they have such money from? From me. Did you give them the egg? Have you gone insane? The egg is stolen from a museum. You understand? They gave it to Serega to hide. And now they want it back, you understand? Without that, he won?t live. You understand? They?re racketeers. What?s the problem, Asya? Bring Serega here. I?ve got a whole yard full of Afghan veterans. Let them try! It?s too late, Sasha, too late. The egg?s in the chairman?s safe. They?ve arranged a ransom. They want to buy your entire property. What do they need my property for? So that it ceases to exist. Exactly! They want to rob it all and destroy it! They?ll destroy it. Ok, listen here. Bring Serega here. I?m not selling anything. They?ll kill my son. I beg you, my dear. I beg you. Don?t ruin it! They?ll kill him, they?ll kill my son. Sell your house. You?ll buy another. I beg you. You can?t live here anyway. Come on, Asya, calm down, calm down. I?ll give it to them for free. Then we?ll get out of here. We?ll leave. You, me, and Serega. What are you doing? Spare me. Asya! Asya! Spare my son. You won?t believe me, Asya, I?ve suffered a lot for you. I drank, I was thrown out from home, I lived like a hobo at railways, I thought I?d forget you. No, I wouldn?t. I came here for you. I built all of this for you. So that you?d understand, so that you?d believe. Let?s get out of here, Asya. I beg you. No, no, Sasha, I can?t. I can?t. Why don?t you love me? A Russian woman doesn?t love, she pities. And why would I pity you? You have it all. Great hands, and what a head. And you have money. And you don?t drink at all. No. I don?t need pity. I am my own master! I have self-respect. Lying around under a fence Isn?t for me. I?ve lied there enough! Alright. How much are they offering? 50 million. Ok. Tell them that I accept. Thank you, Sasha. Oh that?s good, cholera! Greetings, everyone! Wonderful lands you have here! Where?s your chairman? Here? Who?s your chairman? Here he is, in front of you. How much is there? 50 lemons in each? Lemons? That?s what they call millions. Excuse me, I?ve never seen? so much money. Get used to it, our time has just begun. Will we count it? There?s enough work for a day here. If it?s not for two. Can I take a look? There you go. Guys, give us the egg. Alexander Nikitich. The egg! Ah! There. Goodbye! Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. All the best. Safe journey. Safe journey! There is SO much money! Victory! Victory, comrades! HURRAY! Hey, Chirkunov! Open up! Fucking bourgie! So many of you. Would you look at that! Why?d you gather here? We?re buying you. Right? Right. You got the money. Didn?t get greedy. There it is. Show it to him! Ah guys, you tricked the racketeers. The egg?s fake! He?s gone completely nuts. Says the egg is fake. He?s completely wasted. Did you dream it or something? You didn?t turn on the TV today? They just showed on TV. A golden egg was stolen from the museum. But it?s fake. You know how deeply the real one is hidden? ?my mother gave birth to me. Vasily Nikitich, calm down. Fake. A fake. 100 million for a fake. We got 100 million for a fake. 100 million! Congratulations! Do we have a bill counter? Count 50 million, and the rest is ours, the kolkhoz?s. You drank out the whole kolkhoz, sold it out, tore it up. And will tear this up as well now! Stop blabbing and bring the counter! Wait, wait, the counter?! What kind of money do you have here? This is your money? Guy, here, take your money! Asya! You wanted to buy me with this money? Take it, take it! Some money you?ve earned there! There they are! Help! The chairman?s unwell! Guys, help! Here?s your money! Here! Why didn?t you look properly, huh? Why didn?t you look properly, huh? Why didn?t you see what kind of money they gave us? They gave us two briefcases! And he didn?t count anything! And you, why didn?t you count it? Stop! Who was the first to speak of a miracle? Who, who? You did! What have I got to do with it? Ryabushka! there she is, Ryabushka! Catch her! Are you crazy? Dad, our people came! Our people came. Fuck! It?s today that Petya the gypsy is giving his daughter away for marriage!. Fuck! I completely forgot! Gonna drink now! Did they catch the chicken? Catch what?? The chicken. Which chicken? Did you hear, they caught some chicken? Which chicken? Where are you going? Come! Well done! People! People! Fire! Well? Nice fire, no? Come in, guys! Treats for everyone today! Free of charge! Why are you standing around? Bring the buckets! Bring the buckets! Why are you standing around? Asya, where are you going? Don?t extinguish it! Don?t come close, I?ll kill you! I?ll kill you! He?s drunk! Come here, man. Come on. Here?s 100,000, play properly! So my feet start dancing. Why the long faces? Have you never seen a fire or something? I treat you to champagne! Asya, are you ok? Guys! She respects it! Pour her a glass! There you go! Hey, guys! The wine cart is on fire! Asya! A bit more to the right. I?m taking a photo! One more time! One more time! Get lost! Asya, you?ll fucking burn! Hold her! Hold her! Everything?s burned down, everything. Nothing to rebuild. Everything?s burned! How could you, Sasha? It?s a sin! God will forgive me. Do you love me like this? Tell me, do you love me? Huh? You love me. I don?t love you. Forgive me, please. What was I saying? Ah, yes. Maybe Serenka is right. We really are savages. It?s true. What changed in our village in the last 1000 years? Definitely nothing. What do you think? In my opinion, nothing. It?s the same as it used to be. Take this grass, for example. Snow falls on it, and rain, and hail. But it stays the same. Doesn?t change. Always growing up. It used to be grass. Even 1000 years ago it was grass. And now it?s still grass. Maybe that?s good? Maybe it?s right? Maybe that?s how it?s supposed to be? What do you think? My dear gentlemen. Sunday? A rainy day? Subtitles by gemurmel
