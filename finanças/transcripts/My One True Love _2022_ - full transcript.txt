Raymond Taylor? How can you remember that? How could she not? That was the last time the three of us came here together. We had to call 911 because your braces got stuck to his. Oh it was so horrible. I can still remember the pieces of chili cheese dog trapped between us. Well speaking of chili cheese dogs, I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat. That's when I realized I've never had a friend try to set me up with their friends. Should I be scared to find out why? Maybe I should be offended. I did try and set you up. The 7th grade doesn't count. Don't worry you're gonna meet someone. Besides, we can't all be as lucky as Helen here and be a stay at home mom, with a perfect husband and a pair of slightly spoiled, but adorable kids. Who are in need of a little brother or sister. You and Brian better get to work on that. Oh, no, no, no, no. One boy and one girl is just right for me. Next. Hi, can I get a single cheeseburger? Wait, no, make that a double. A corn dog, extra large fries and an extra large drink. Oh, can I also get some chile cheese fries and a extra large strawberry shake. Is that for all of us or just you? - Me. - Oh. What? I'm hungry. Can you make that a triple cheeseburger? You gonna finish that? Enjoy. Thanks, man. Ooh, look at her, gorgeous. Do you ever stop? If you were a Transformer, you'd be Optimus Fine. Have any of your lines actually worked? I swing and miss often. But in professional baseball getting a hit three out of 10 times is considered an excellent average, my friend. Oh I see where you're looking. You know the question is, are you going to step up to the plate or you gonna watch from the stands? You're embarrassing. No, this is a momentous occasion. I can't remember the last time you even looked at a woman. Well, not since Jessica. Yeah. I know. Where are the kids today? Oh, Brian took the day off to be with them. The kids wanted him to bring them here, but I know somehow they'd find me and I'd be covered in dirt and food. You're doing a pretty good job all on your own. So, how's work? Same as always. Haven't you been stuck there for five years? I wouldn't put it that way. It's a job and it's steady. Plus, I'm even getting a promotion soon. Oh, that's awesome. I couldn't sit in front of a computer all day. But a Computer and Information Systems Manager sounds important, right I really don't think I would change a thing with my life. Everything's great. Knock on wood. That's metal. I just didn't picture you single and sitting in front of a computer at this point in your life. Not that there is anything wrong with that. What did you picture her life like then? I don't know, married, maybe a kid or two, working as a nurse, you used to carry band-aids around in your pockets growing up. I did want to become a nurse. And not everyone has the goal of getting hitched Helen. I'm not saying she should be married, I'm just saying, I thought she would be. Well, like I said, I am happy just the way things are. Now's your chance, here they come. No, no, no, no, no. You're not gonna say anything? It's all right man, I got you. Oh it's handy that I brought my library card because I'm totally checking you out. Was that addressed to all three of us or did you feel like singling one of us out? Because she is married, she's unavailable and I'm not interested. Well, tell me this, are you religious? Because you are the answer to my prayers. I'll start praying for you to disappear. Ooh, ouch. Come on, you guys, you should be ashamed of yourselves. I take no part in this. I imagine you two should be here working not wasting tax payer money hitting on the guests. Hang on, I think you misunderstood. No, you're done. Why don't you keep an eye on him. Have a good day. What? Come on. You are vicious. Honest, is all. Unavailable? Well unavailable to them, yes. Allison. Me? I've been expecting you. Come in. Come in. Do you know her? - Really are we doing this? - Come on. Which one of you be liking to go first? Sure, why not? Your palm. I see green aventurine with dark, brown stones. Tiger's eye. And black obsidian. And I'm coming to a divide. One side feels intense and will become successful. You will innovate, adapt and grow. Other side will decline. A challenging assignment will likely give you opportunity to prove your mettle. But you are up to the task. A little vague but I'll take it. Okay, I'm next. Hi. Now, what I am looking for is peace of mind, to be skinnier and maybe my husband to be a little more. Ouch. Close your eyes. Do not keep things in your heart, share them with the one you love. It will only improve your mutual understanding. What, no tiger's blood or stones for me? No colors? Rouge. Double rouge. Heavier times. That's it? That's all I get? It's plenty. Thank you. Okay, my turn. Destiny has much in store for you. Spit. Huh? [Madame Zoe Spit. I think she wants you to spit in her hand. Oh, disgusting. The sun, the moon and the stars are converging. Universe is pushing you to embrace the changes of the three. The stars shows, you will find new place to call home. The scales of the moon are imbalanced and you will need to find a new trade. Something that is closer to your heart. At last, the fiery sun urges you to be on the lookout for your soulmate, a man named John. He will be the love of your life. She told me the exact opposite of what I wanted. I asked for skinny and she tells me heavy. Does that mean I am gonna get fat? I would have been happy if she predicted mono. Why did you say you wanted your husband to be a little more average? Okay, this may sound strange, but sometimes my husband drives me crazy. - What? - What? Don't get me wrong, I love Brian but sometimes he is too perfect, you know. He's too loving and caring. Oh, that sounds terrible. My heart bleeds for you. Well, at least I'm excited about my fortune, a challenging assignment that will test my mettle. Well then Ali gets the mother load. What was it, a new home, a trade, must be job. Oh and a new man named John. No. And please no. I have an amazing apartment and my job is secure and I have no interests in any Johns. All right, go ahead. What do you think she meant by heavy? Oh don't give it any credence, it's just vague guess work. Oh, only two at a time when you are so. If you say big, so help me. When you are an adult. Only two adults per chair. Okay. You guys can go ahead, I'll just catch the next one. Here we go. All right, go ahead. Thanks. Have fun. You ride one of these before? Yeah, they're lots of fun. I'm Ali. I'm John. I'm sorry, did you say, John? John Kimball. Guys, you're never guess who I'm up here with. Who's that? My new friend, John Kimball. You see, the predictions are already coming true. Are you afraid of heights? I don't think so. I should probably answer this. Hi, this is Ali. What? How did this happen? Could anything be saved? I understand. Thanks for letting me know. Everything okay? My apartment flooded and there is a lot of damage. How much is a lot? Like I could charge people admission to come and swim. What? The first part of the fortune. It has to be a coincidence. Just catch the next one, I guess. Oh, no, not again. Not again? I'll get help. That can't be good. Don't worry John. Okay, I've decided I don't like heights. Me neither. I mean, when we are moving it's one thing but being stationery is a whole different story. Is that? Yup. Hi. You? You guys wanna come down from there? Yes, sir. Yes, please. Be careful. I've got you. All right, hold on. Ali, Ali. Thank you, mister. We're back on the ground. Right, oh. Why don't we get you out of here. Sorry. Bye. You are so brave. Thank you. Sean. Sean Carpenter. Sean. Hi, we were so worried about you. I've been stress eating so bad. Do you have some water. Hey. Hi. Come in. Thanks for letting me stay. Yeah, of course. Stay as long as you need. Is this it? Pretty much everything was ruined in the flood. My clothes, my computer, my furniture. Even my toothbrush. I was planning on donating these to a thrift store, but they've lived in my trunk for the past several months. They smell like they died in your trunk. I'll introduce you to my washing machine later. What are you working on? Oh, a commercial. Oh, what kinda actors are you looking for? Just one happily married couple. I have already found the wife, but I'm still looking for right actor to play the part of the husband. Everyone I've put up on the board though just doesn't feel right. The board? Oh, casting board. Basically photos of all the potential actors. We like to see who looks good together. Oh, it's Helen. Hello. Hey, is Ali with you? I'm right here. Okay, do I need to be the one who says it? Says what? Madame Zoe was right. She got one thing right. There's no way she could have guessed your apartment would flood. I have yet to be presented with something that will test my mettle. I haven't had a production I couldn't cast. Yeah, well, it hasn't even been a few hours, I'd give it time. No way. Besides, I have a promotion coming up at work. I'm meeting with my bosses about it, tomorrow. And you can borrow some of my clothes. Thank you. So you see Helen, you have nothing to worry about. Fine, bye. Okay, sorry about that. "Oh dear, elephant got scared and ran away." Hi. Bob. Ali. - Harold. - Ali. - Tina. - Ali. New guy. I'm Ali. Have a seat. This is Richard. He's part of a consulting company that helps restructure corporations in transition. Great. I mean, I know this promotion's gonna be coming with a lot of changes but what kinda transition are we talking about here? Downsizing. We're not here to give me the promotion? You promised me this six months ago. I know. But your whole department is going to be consolidated. We through time, hopefully we can rehire. Well, after the restructure period. We need to streamline ourselves through corporate restructuring. That good of a day, hah? I got canned. What? Discharged, axed, laid-off, furloughed, let go, terminated. Just like that? They gave me the option of staying until the end of the week or leaving today. Oh, Ali, I'm so sorry. I should have seen the warning signs. The numerous closed-door meetings, no new hires, the decrease of work loads. Ice cream? Ice cream. It's over. It's the end. I can't go on. Did someone die? No. I'm pregnant. With twins. We're out of tissues. I'll see if I have another box. How far along are you? Almost three months. Do you know what your having? Boys? Girls? One of each? I have another ultrasound in a few weeks. Do you know what you want? This is all I could find. Thank you. Well, if you're extra hungry during your pregnancy, you're probably pregnant with a boy, right? That's not proven, is it? By the way you were chowing down at the carnival the other day, I'd say you have about half a baseball team in there. Do you wanna know what the worst part about it is? What? Brian is excited. He's genuinely excited. Well should he not be? I don't want to be the one to say this, but everything Madame Zoe has said is coming true. Madame Zoe said double rouge. Double pink. Maybe you're having twin girls. By heavy, she meant pregnant, not fat. And the first two parts of my fortune have already come true, needing a new place to live and needing a new job. Wait, what? I lost my job today. We need to speak with Madame Zoe and get this straightened out. It just makes me feel pretty bad trying to reach to his high standards. I mean, I know I'm a good mom but Brian is always one step ahead of me, and he doesn't do things because he feels like he is better than me, he just wants to help. But it makes me feel bad. I don't think the carnival is open yet. Come on. Hey, Helen. Hurry. Okay. I don't even know how to approach him and ask him to stop or change. I just want him to relax sometimes, you know. Leave the dirty dishes in the sink and forget to help the kids with their homework, watch lots of TV after coming home from work. It almost sounds like you're asking how to make Brian a worse husband, a less concerned father and a lazier man. Maybe it wasn't a fortune. It was a curse. Oh my gosh we've been cursed. We weren't cursed. There was that woman in Florida who got prison time and had to repay $1.6 million to a woman she cursed. Stop trying to convince yourself that we were cursed. Maybe she's inside. Madame Zoe. Madame Zoe, are you there? Madame Zoe. You have to be in there. Madame Zoe. That's it, I'm going in. What? What are you doing? You'll see, you'll see. You see, I could have easily fit through if I wasn't pregnant. You try. That's not a good idea. Oh I'm sorry, but you're smaller than me. We have to get in there. We have to speak with her. Fine. Alright. Gosh. Oh no. What? I think I'm stuck. How bad? I can't move. Do you want me to push or pull? Pull. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna pull, okay. You ready? Okay not helping. Not helping. Try sucking in. I am sucking it in. Hello again. Hey. How's it going? You okay here? - No. - Yes, fine. We don't need any help. You won't happen to know if Madame Zoe is here yet? Oh I think she won't be back for several weeks. What? Yeah, the carnival's moving on to another city, possibly even out of state. Great. So what are you doing here? Just here as a safety precaution as everything gets packed up. Oh, that was really nice of you the other night, saving that little boy and my friend here. Of course, happy to help. You sure you're all right? Yes. Good. Fine. It's nice to see you again. We better run. He's super cute. So long. You see what I mean. Not only do the kids love him, but apparently all the mothers do here as well. Well, what's not to like? Brooke. Hey, no more complaining about Brian, okay? Just positive things coming from your mouth. You're right, you're right. I'll work on it. So, Madame Zoe is gone? Yeah, for several weeks. What were you planning on saying to her anyway? That we want a refund. Or for her to take back what she said. I think it's a little too late for some things. Well she should. I mean I have to start my life completely over. I need to find a new job, a new place to live. I have to buy everything again. It's like I am starting from scratch. Am I having like a mid-midlife crisis? No. Look on the bright side, at least you are not suffering from pregnancy brain. And apparently my toes have decided to grow along with my belly. Sadly, I had to say goodbye to my cute shoes. Positive, remember, Helen? I thought I was being positive. Madame Zoe said that you will find the love of your life, right? Something like that. Okay, well instead of focusing on the negative, let's really do focus on the positive here. What exactly did she say? She said something about looking for my soulmate. His name being John. Okay, that sounds promising to me. A soulmate who will be the love of your life. We can help you. Yes. What do you mean? This could be the challenging assignment. You know, the one where I am to prove my mettle. We can help you on your quest to find the right John. Oh it'll be perfect. It will help keep your mind off of things and it will give you something to do. I do have something to do, I have to find a new job. No one's going to date me, sleeping on your couch. You search for a new job. And we'll find your John. Hey, I got a new one. Oh please, no. Let me try it out on you. Go on, feel my jacket. It's made of boyfriend material. No? That doesn't work? It might be your worst one yet. Okay. Okay, I got another one, you ready? Do I have a choice? Hey, girl, is your name WiFi, 'cause we got a connection. You do realize most women hate pick up lines. Oh, are you an expert on women now? Far from it. Maybe just try saying, hello, next time. It could work wonders despite its simplicity. This coming from a guy that who hasn't been on a date in a year. Or was it two? You got a point. And why is that anyway? I know your heart was broken. But it has had plenty of time to repair itself. You know, I did run into carnival girl again. Brown hair, yellow dress? That's the one. What? And you thinking you like her? I wouldn't mind seeing her again. That's what I'm talking about. Now, what are you gonna do about it? All right ladies, how do we go about this? We'll start by putting together a list of Johns. How many Johns do you know off the top of your head? Two Johns from work. One from the gym. The mailman. I need last names. The Johns from work are Peebler and Green. And the other two I don't know. We'll call them Gym John and Mailman John. Oh, my old landlord's name is John. Oh, Landlord John. No, wait. His name is Steve. Oh. But I have down my list of potential jobs for me, you guys wanna hear? Sure. Pharmacist. Lawyer. Dental Hygienist. Librarian. Sales. Educator and nurse. Oh, you're talking a complete career change, not just a new job. I mean, at this point, I'm not really sure. But something new and different may be just what I need. That's it? Four names is all you can come up with? That should make finding the right John real easy. Oh no, four does not cut it. Here's what we'll do, we will all go through our phones and write down anyone with the name John. Sean, hold up. What's this? You can thank me later. Is this? How did you get this? It was with the incident report. She must have left it. Now she didn't leave a phone number, but I do see an address right there. I don't know. You're the one that said you want to get to know her better. And now you have this opportunity of chivalrously returning her lost Driver's License to her. You can thank me later. To become a Librarian I would need a Master's in Library and Information Science. But I can earn this degree 100 percent online. Ali the librarian? I don't see it. I guess I'll still send out my resume to those looking for an IT manager. John Moyer and John Underwood. That's all of them. How many are on the list now? 30, 40? Close, 187. That's ridiculous. No. You take half and find someone for yourself. No, the fortune was about you. She didn't say anything about my love life. Look, why don't you go out for a bit and we can finish this up? Fine. I do need to see if my landlord was able to salvage anything else. Just give us a few hours and we'll have everything ready for you. Wouldn't be considered stalking, would it? No, it's a bad idea, Sean. You should leave. You should definitely leave. Oh no, no, no, you're just returning this to her, you're already here. I might as well knock. I can do that. You can do that, Sean. Hey, does an Ali Schafer live here? Are you the insurance adjuster? No, I'm a friend. Oh she had to move out. Her place flooded along with most of the apartments in this building. Gonna be at this for a while. If you do see her though, tell her she's not gonna be able to move back in for a few weeks. Hey. Hey Ali, did your friend find you? What friend? He was just here looking for you? He, did he leave a name or say what he wanted? I can't remember. Oh wait, were you able to save anything else? - All right, there you are. - Thank you. Have a great day. John. Hey I'm John. You have a good day. Thank you. - Hey babe. - Hey. You ready? Okay let's head out. This is Ali. Yes, I'm so glad my resume reached you. An interview? Yes. Monday at two. Yes, I will see you then. Okay great. Thanks again. Monday at two, interview. Oh my goodness. Excuse me. I am so sorry. I should've been watching where I was going. Hello again. Hi. It's Ali, right? Yes. Sean. I remember. I promise I am not this accident prone. You just seem to catch me at my worst. Been avoiding Ferris Wheels? At all costs. Life has been a bit of an adventure since that night. In a good way or a bad way? Well, let's see, I lost my job. Ouch. My apartment flooded. I know. And the Ferris Wheel incident, all that within 24 hours. I'm sorry. Hopefully that's the worst of it. Wait, I'm sorry, how did you know about my apartment? Oh, I tried dropping this off earlier. You left it when filling out the incident report. Would've tried calling but we didn't have your number. I didn't even notice it was missing. It's a good thing I haven't been pulled over. Yeah. Thanks. Of course. Well, at the rate we are going, I'm sure I'll see you again. Hope, uh, probably. See ya. Bye. Good news guys. I have a job interview for. What is all of this? It's your casting wall. These are the men who are auditioning for your heart. Is every wall covered? Pretty much. We've numbered all of them. And we've put together details for each and every one. Basically a list of their skills, qualifications, educations, likes, dislikes. How did you find all of this out? You can find out anything you want on the internet. Now whether it's all true, that's a different story. Go ahead, try it out, pick a number. 117. Oh, he's a handsome one. This is John Jeffries. He's a martial arts instructor, has his own dojo. No kids, never been married. Favorite movie is, "Best of the Best." Dislikes pickles, mustard and coconut. He's 44 years old. No, he's not gonna work out. Was it the pickles? No. He's too old for me. I think, like 10 years older than me is my limit. Okay, good to know. We can eliminating a bunch by knowing what your requirements are. Have a seat. We will put them all in three categories, Yes, no and maybe. And we don't eliminate the maybes. There have been plenty of times that someone out of the maybes has ended up wowing the director and getting the part. So John Jeffries is a no? What would prevent you from going out with someone? I don't know. Well, how important are looks to you? Not super important, but I mean it's a plus if he's attractive. Is there anyone here on the walls, you'd eliminate just by looks? I don't know, I mean, I feel super weird judging all these Johns just based on their photos. Fine, we won't eliminate any based on looks. So 10 years older is the limit, can he be younger than you? No, no one younger than me. Really, not even like a year or just a few months? Okay, someone between 30 and 40. Let's see what that does. That only eliminates 24. They never even got a chance. There's still 163 on the list. Oh, I thought of something. I would like for them to have a job, be financially responsible and to not live at home with their parents. How much taller than you can he be? Eight inches. What? I don't want to have to stand on a stool to kiss him. So what does that do to the numbers? Has to be employed, not living with parents, between 5.4 and six feet. Anything else? I think that's a pretty good start. Okay. That eliminates another 73. 90. That's a great number to start scheduling. Scheduling? Your dates. 90. Don't worry. We have a plan. Am I supposed to be the one contacting these people? Just the Johns you know. I'll worry about the ones I know and Brooke will contact the ones she knows. It's either that or we create a dating profile for you stating that you are looking for your soulmate named John. Okay, your way is better. You're doing good buddy, just a little further. There you are. I got you. Here you go Miss. Geez, thanks mister. You see that, fulfilling your knightly responsibilities. Oh speaking of, how did it go with the future Mrs. Carpenter? I blew it. I didn't ask her out. I didn't even ask her for her number. I'll probably never see her again. You're just out of practice, that's all. Maybe you'll get another shot. Oh, look at those little feet. They sure are wiggly in there. It feels like they are having a wrestling match. Let's see if we can find that heartbeat. I read that a higher fetal heartbeat means you're having a girl. How high? Over 140. What's normal? 120 to 160 beats per minute. It's so beautiful. There's still only two in there, right? Yes. Two healthy heart beats. Both over 140. Would you like to know the genders? Oh no, my husband and I would like to find out at the same time, but he couldn't make it today because he is home with our sick little girl. Oh well, we'll do it next time then. If you don't mind me asking, how long did it take you to become an Ultra Sound Tech? Ah, see, with school and everything, about four years. Seems worth it. Oh, definitely. Well, the doctor will be in shortly. Thank you. So are you still weighing your career options? I've made up my mind that I wanna try something completely different. The other day when I went in for my job interview, it was very clear that I'm no longer interested in that field. And I think the company could see it too. Are you leaning toward anything particular? Sadly, no. Yes? Hey, make it quick, the doctor will be in any minute. Okay I have everything booked. I just sent you over the calendar. You have me going out every night this week. Guys, I'm starting to second guess this decision. Oh you are not backing out now. You are committed. I'm gonna get so fat eating out that much. Not every date is taking you out to eat. And we've put them in charge of what you are going to be doing. And we did say no to zero effort men. We did not accept coffee or a walk as a suitable date option and neither should you. But I like walks. You are not a dog. And I have a Nespresso machine at home. You know, I think it's all about compatibility. When people our age, get set and comfortable in their routines, we forget how to be around others. Did you read that somewhere? In a magazine in the waiting room. Guys maybe we should just let a John come into my life instead of forcing it to happen. So far the only John that has come into your life naturally is the kid on the Ferris Wheel. Oh, gotta go, bye. Hi, Doctor Murphy. Hi. John. Alison Schafer? Oh my gosh. How are you? We knew each other in high school. In fact, I think that's the last time I saw you. We had like four or five classes together. Did you hear Mr. Green retired? History teacher, Green? After 46 years, can you believe that? Oh Helen, I'm so sorry, you and your babies are the priority here. How are you feeling? Oh, no, you two should catch up. Maybe over lunch or something. I don't. I think that's a good idea. I'll add him to the list. This would be a lot easier if you just wait until I was finished. Brian's gonna be here any minute. I know. Oh got it, she's all yours. What's wrong? Aren't you excited? I guess I am a little apprehensive. It's been a while since I've been out on a date. Don't be afraid of rejection. Besides, you're gonna be the one doing the rejecting. That sounds worse. I mean, it just doesn't seem fair to everyone else I'm gonna be going out with. Just have fun. If there is something there, pursue it. If not, remember that the date's gonna be over in a couple hours and you don't have to see him again, if you don't want to. Plus, you're charming and beautiful and anyone, John or not, would be lucky to go out with you. Thanks. I don't see it. He's a maybe. Remember what you said about maybes. Is he one of yours? He's one of mine. I knew him from college. Oh. I'll get it. Hey Ali. Hi John. You ready to go? I'm all ready. Great. He better open the door for her. Yeah, or else this date is over real quick. Oh good, he did it. Lucky for him. Everything okay? Yeah, great. It's been a few years since college, how've you been? Oh, so great. And your family, they good? Oh yeah, they're really great. That's great. Tell me everything. Is he the one? Definite no. What did you guys do? We drove in his truck for a long, long time. I had no idea where we were going. And then we stopped at a gas station where he bought me an ice cream bar and then took me back home. Was the conversation at least good? Oh it was great. Or at least that is how he responded to every single thing that I asked him. Who's next? Hi Ali. Wow, this looks great. We'll it tastes even better. Will someone be joining us? That must be my mother. I think I love all of 'em. The best one is my Florida tattoo. Wanna see Florida dance? How tall are you? Just to like venture out and like see other parts. My favorite childhood memories just to do that. Whoa. What? Whoa. It was a very shaky night for the rookie quarterback seeing his first bit of action. He threw for 11-of-24 passes, 112 yards. If you're choosing to start dating again after a long while then you've gotta do it when you really feel like you're ready. You're probably gonna be bringing all of this emotional package with you which is just the worst. ♪ That sparkle in your eye ♪ Tells me I'm the only guy ♪ Who can take your breath away ♪ ♪ And make you smile ♪ Oh my Ali ♪ I'm smitten by you I can't decide if I wanna set her up with this one or this one. I just don't know if I love the mustache. Oh, how'd it go last night? I don't know how much more of this I can take. That good, huh? At the end of the date he hugs me then leans in and says, "I like my women flabby, not firm, "this isn't gonna work out." How did you respond? I said, thank you. And then hurried into the apartment. He wasn't one of mine was he? Well, there are still plenty of Johns on the list. Maybe we went about it the wrong way. What do you mean? Or am I the issue? No. Am I undatable? You are not the issue. Have hope. Tomorrow you have a date with my doctor. Finally, someone normal. Or at least he was in High School. What do you know about this guy anyway? Besides the fact that he's delivering your babies. He dresses really well. Has a nice car, a good job. Single. I might actually be looking forward to this one. So you've never been married? Nope. Never? Why is that so hard for you to believe? I just always pictured you happily married. Oh you drew a picture of me happily married? No, but I could take a shot at it, if you'd like. Thank you. You're welcome. Do you know those yearbook predictions from high school, like, "Whose most likely to end up in prison." You know, that sort of thing. Yeah, did yours say, "Most likely to become a doctor?" Yes, actually, and happily married. You're not married, right? No, no, no, divorced for a few years. No kids. Maybe the happily married part is still yet to come. So what was you predictions? I don't remember. So who left who? She left me. I'm sorry. No, we wanted different things. I wanted a family and she wanted Raul, her personal trainer. You know, she would always tell me how exhausting it was for her to have to tell me all the things that I needed to do. And I'd reason, you know, "Just tell me what you want me to do "and I'll gladly do it." She didn't want to be my mother. You okay? John? John? He's choking. Help, somebody help. Come here, I've got you, I've got you. There you go, breathe, breathe. Are you okay? Yeah, thank you. Have a seat. Let's make sure you're all right. Grab some water. Hi. The date was that bad? The date was actually going really well, that is until John started choking and I panicked. - Is he okay? - What happened? I wanted to do something, but I just froze and did nothing. Luckily, the fireman from the carnival was there and helped him. Was it the handsome one or bad pick up lines. His name is Sean. I don't even think I thanked him. I don't know what my problem is. I was sitting there staring at her the entire time. While she was on a date with another guy. I'm just setting my up for failure. What are you doing? Hi. Ali. Hey, I gotta go, yeah. Can I? I wanted to say thank you for saving the guy that I was with. How's your date, is he doing okay? As far as I know. Good. It looked like your date was going well. It was, actually, well until, you know. Why did you keep staring at me while you were on a date with another woman? I hope it wasn't a date. What? My aunt, Sherry. The woman I was with was my aunt, Sherry. Oh. Sorry for jumping to conclusions. Yeah. But still, you did keep looking at me. I did. How did you not panic when my date was choking? Like, you came over and assessed the situation and acted. You saved his life. You know, I still feel a little nervous every time there is a situation like that, but I just let the training take over. What would it take to become a first responder? Any particular field, Paramedic, EMT, firefighter? I started taking an EMT course my freshman year, but I never finished. I'm sure that would be easy to pick back up. What happened earlier at the cafe, I do not want a repeat of that. I want to be ready and willing to act. Everyone responds different in a situation like that. But you responded how I want to respond. Finish your EMT course and I'm sure you would. What are the typical hours like for an EMT? Mostly 12 hour shifts. But it's not uncommon to have to stay late because of a call that comes in at the end of your shift. And how long did you get certified? Six months at a community college. I was taking other courses at the same time. Being EMT certified really helped when I decided to become a fireman. What made you decide that? My mom. She embroidered a quote and hung it on our wall at home. It was from Ralph Waldo Emerson. And it said, "The purpose of life is not to be happy. "It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, "to have it make some difference that you have lived "and lived well." Your mom embroidered all that? Yeah. And you feel like you're making a difference? Some days, yeah. All in all, I recommend it as a profession if you're looking to give back to your community. On the other hand, if you're looking to be a hero or make a lot of money, it's not the field for you. Thanks for answering all of my questions, I know it was a lot. Yeah, no problem. Let me give you my number. If you have any more questions, I could. Oh yeah. Okay yeah, that would be great. That's nice actually. Okay, I've finally decided, I want to be a first responder. Like a firefighter? I wanna be an EMT and then work my way up to being a paramedic. Is there a difference? Well EMTs, they mostly deal with CPR, tourniquet application and wound treatment. Paramedics perform more advanced procedures. I think you are suffering the effects from your mid-midlife crisis. I'm serious. After talking to Sean, I am sure that this is what I wanna do. But isn't that like starting over with school? Are you still going to have time while we're trying to find your one and only John? You guys are not being too supportive. Did Sean talk you into this? Not at all. I just asked him a bunch of questions. And we actually had a lot of fun together, we spent the entire afternoon talking. That's swell and all, but you are supposed to be finding love with a John. Mom. Alright everyone, let's find out what these babies are. Don't forget you have six dates this week. Six? Check your calendar. I did give you tomorrow off. Oh I should probably tell you that I set you up on a second date with my doctor and it's tomorrow. Okay, on the count of three. One, two, three. Oh my goodness. Double rouge. Nice swing. Thanks. You sure you haven't done this before? First time. Wow, that is incredibly accurate. Don't look so surprised. Are you sure you're not signed with the PGA? This was a good idea. Yeah, I'm glad we did this. So I've been thinking of making a career change. Something still with computers, right? EMT, actually. That's is quote the change. I know. Are you sure you want to do that? You don't think I should? No, no, no, it's not what I meant. It's just. It's the hospital, I got a delivery, I gotta go. It's not Helen, is it? No, no, no, she's still a ways out. We should do this again sometime. Sure. Sorry. Hey, hold up. Who is it? Hi. Hey. It's her isn't it? I wanted to say thanks again for answering all my questions the other day. I decided that I want to be an EMT. That's awesome. And then maybe work my way up to being a paramedic. I could totally see you doing that. Thank you. You're the first person who's shown any excitement about this. What's not to be excited about? It's such a great choice, I know you are gonna love it. I was wondering if you would point me in the right direction. I could do better than that. I could help you along the way and make sure you take the best courses with the best teachers. Show you what to prepare for, help you with the exams. You would do that? Yeah, I wanna see you succeed. Thank you. I'll put some things together for you and maybe we can meet up tomorrow morning. Let me check my calendar, one sec. I can't tomorrow morning. When can you? Or Thursday morning. You're a busy lady. How's Friday morning? I'll make it work. Come by the fire station around nine. Great. Thank you. Perfect, I'll see you then. Bye. That's right, that's right. Man. What are we going to do about Ali? I'm worried about her. I think out of everyone she's seen so far, I think Doctor John is the best. What is it? It's too quiet. Brian. Brian. Try calling him. Yeah. Voicemail again. Maybe he finally snapped. He realized that being married to you is too much work and he is on his way to Belize. This is so unlike him. Isn't this what you wanted though? Irresponsible, lazy, less perfect. Yeah, but kids were supposed to be to bed hours ago. Oh, he's gonna be in so much trouble. I'm sure they're fine. Have you noticed Ali is starting to act irrationally. Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that? What? That. Too perfect, huh? Oh you've gotta be kidding me. What? He sent me some texts I didn't even see. Letting me know the kids were scared, and he was gonna stay with them, but would get to the dishes after they fell asleep. I am a bad wife. You're not a bad wife. You're just starting to realize what an amazing man you have. He is pretty amazing, huh? And he even left some dishes for you to do. But look what he did to me. Oh I think you had a little bit to do with that yourself. So what are we gonna do about Ali? I wouldn't stress about it. She's made up her mind about work and the best thing we can do is support her. Yeah, just as long as she doesn't forget about finding her soulmate, John. I made a list of some things you'll need to do and some resources to help you get signed up. This is amazing, thank you. You don't need a college degree to be an EMT, but you do need a high school diploma. Check. You'll need to be CPR certified before you enroll in the course. Okay, I had one of those but I think it's expired now. Yeah most certifications only last for a year or two, so you'll have to redo that. But luckily, we offer a course, it only takes a couple hours. Sign me up for the next one. Then you'll have to take the cognitive exam. Is that the kind of that the test that you can take online? Yep. You'll answer between 60 and 110 questions. What kinds of questions? It covers everything from airways, ventilation, respiration, cardiology, resuscitation. It takes about two hours. The biggest thing you'll need to do is complete a state-approved education program. Is that like the one I started in college? Yep. However, there is an accelerated EMT training course. It takes only 19 days, as opposed to six months at a community college. Okay. I definitely want to do the accelerated course. It's just my schedule is a little crazy over the next little while. Oh. I know it sounds bad, it's just I have a date like every day for the next several weeks. Every day? With the same guy or different guys? Different. Oh, dare I ask? I know, it sounds so bad saying it out loud. It's complicated. But I am serious about being an EMT. So I'm going to start as soon as I can. Amid your serial dating? You don't know the half of it. While we wait for the last few people to arrive, make sure you have your packet so we can review. And we're going to go over the, "Dr's ABCs" shortly. Thanks for coming with me. Yeah, no problem. One of my worst fears is one of my kids choking and me not knowing what to do. So, how did the date with the latest John go? While we were watching the movie I reached for the popcorn and he pulled the tub away and asked if my hands were clean. Oh I'm so sorry. It gets better. He said he had to go to the bathroom and he took the tub of popcorn with him. What? And then he never came back. At least I was finally able to enjoy the movie. Hey, Helen, will you cancel all my upcoming dates? Even my doctor? No, he actually has some potential, but all the others, I just can't handle. I really wanna focus on my EMT training. Okay, as long as you take time to focus on Doctor John. Thank you. Now I have to convince Brooke. All right, everyone, the "Dr's ABCs" is a handy acronym to help you remember what to do when you find someone unconscious. You can't give up. I'm not giving up. I just can't go on any more blind dates. But some potential good ones are coming up. How many dates have I been on? A lot. Over 50. 50 dates. And I've only been on one second date, one. What does that tell you? That I've failed. No. Yes. No. Look, I appreciate everything that you and Helen have set up for me, I just, I think it was too much, all at once. I may have gone a little overboard. A little. Are you sure? I'm sure. But you still think there is potential with Doctor John? I do. He's really nice. But we have yet to finish a date. Nice hit, nice hit, nice hit. There you go. Nice. That's game. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have played that hard. I'm glad you didn't hold back. This is your first time playing? It showed that much? No, you're great. I mean, you play like a pro. So, how's the EMT thing going? I have test coming up. If I pass, I can start the accelerated course. I'm a little nervous. No, I'm sure you'll do great. Maybe you can help me study? How? I don't know, like quiz me on things like, "How many liters of oxygen "is a D size cylinder capable of carrying?" Look, it's the hospital. I'm sorry, our gotta get going. I'm still trying to figure out this whole balance between work like and personal life. You mean like not dating your patients friends? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. Which symptoms are most commonly associated with cardiac related chest pain? It's not lower back pain, jaw pain. That's correct. All right, next one. What patient would be the most likely to require insulin injections? A 92-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes. A 25-year-old male with Type 1 diabetes. 25-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes. You don't wanna hear the other options? Well if he's a 25-year-old male with Type 1 Diabetes, he most likely isn't capable of producing his own insulin. You got 'em all. You're definitely ready. I feel ready. You nervous? Not with you in my corner. Thanks for helping me study. Of course. What's the rule about having boys over when I am not here? She's kidding. I was just leaving. I bet you were. You'll do awesome tomorrow. Thanks. Nice to see you again. What do you think you are doing? Studying for my test tomorrow. With your hair all done up nice and smelling all, smelling, you're wearing my perfume. You said I could borrow some. Yeah, when you're out with Doctor John, not with that guy. Don't worry. I'm seeing Doctor John tomorrow after my test. Good. I just wanted to make sure your priorities are straight. On call again? Yeah. I mean, that's why I chose this place, just in case I'm called in. Does that ever get to you? Just always feeling like you're at work? It's crossed my mind. But I love what I do. It feels like, taking care of women is my life's calling. You know, that sounded a lot more strange coming out than just staying up there. Wasn't your dad a surgeon? Yeah, he still is. I mean, that's why I got into the medical field, in the first place. I love surgery. I mean you can actually cure a patient's disease with the right operation. Then I delivered my first baby and it all made sense. You know, in my line of work, there's two patients, the mother and the child. And there is nothing like bringing new life in the world. I got to be at my niece's birth. And seeing those little hands and her eyes open, for the first time, it was amazing. I can see why you do it. What? It's kinda like we just picked back up from when we were in high school. You're never gonna believe. The hospital? I'm sorry I have to cut our time short. It's okay, I understand. I'm off next week, okay, I'll pick you up, take you on a formal date. Okay. Thank you for understanding me. Yeah, of course. Sean. Ali. Is everything all right? Where did you run from? You passed. Yeah. 100%, that's amazing. Thanks to you. Hey, I just led you in the right direction. That's all you. I couldn't have done it without you. Let's celebrate. We can celebrate by letting me take you out. I'm all sweaty. How about this Saturday? That is, if it doesn't interfere with your other dating adventures. That's pretty much done with now, thank goodness. Really? Saturday would be nice. I'm glad you came. It's nice to spend some time together. Studying doesn't count? You know what I mean. This is one of the few times you haven't seen me in uniform. It does look good on you. Thanks. I bet your mom is really proud of you being a fireman. My mom? Her quote that inspired you, right? Oh. Yeah, she would be. I lost both my parents when I was in college. I'm sorry. It's okay, it was a long time ago. Now the only family I have close by is my aunt. The one you thought I was dating. But she is always off traveling, so. I imagine it gets lonely, not having any family around. Definitely. What were your parents like? Everything a kid could ask for. I had a really ideal childhood growing up. I was a very happy kid. My family, ate dinner together every night, prayed together. My parents even came to all of my baseball games. Now my family is my work. What about a family of your own? You know I almost got married once. After a year together, she said, "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." And she ended it. I'm sorry. It's okay. Better to break up before we got married. And no one since then? No, just me and my work. What about you? Same, I guess. I kinda just threw myself into work and my routine and just never made time for friends or anything else, really. I guess I just got comfortable. Yeah, I get that. What did I just walk into? An intervention. You and Sean have been spending lots of time together. Yeah. Because he's been helping me study. I don't think there was any studying today, unless it was about the nerves in each others lips? We haven't kissed. - Good. - Why not? Listen, I really enjoy spending time with Sean. We know why he is helping you. It's because he likes you. I like him too. What about John? I like both John and Sean. Helen and I agree that this John could be the one. It's just, we're not enough of a priority to one another. But John's great. Yeah, when I actually have a chance to see him. Sean is really nice though. Helen, not helping. Do you have feelings for Sean? I'm not sure. What's holding you back? Everything Madame Zoe has said has come true and that's why I keep wanting to spend time with Doctor John. But I just a little confused because spending time with Sean is so much easier. Either Madame Zoe's fortunes are real or she is a fraud. So far, she's seemed pretty real. All I know is, I used to feel in control of my life. Then after Madame Zoe, I started to feel uncertain. So many things were concrete and I just feel like I'm on board a ship that's lost at sea, and I have no control. Do you feel you have control now? It's had to feel in control when fortunes seem to be dictating your life. But it's not that. It's fate not dictating your life, but showing you a better future. I just want stability and to feel like I am accomplishing something good. By taking this course, I feel like I am doing that. Maybe Sean is helping you to get what you want. But that doesn't mean that he's the one. You need to make a choose, and you know who I vote for. You kiss her yet? No. And that's none of your business. Of course it's my business. I gotta know when to get me a new suit for when you ask me to be your best man. I'm taking it slow. A little too slow, if you ask me. Does she even know how you feel? I don't know. Why are we talking about this stuff anyways? 'Cause you gotta let her know how you feel. Yeah, I don't know. It seems risky. You're a good looking man, Sean. Thank you, I think. I mean it. You got a lot going on for you. And ever since you met this girl, you've been different. And I don't want you to lose out on this opportunity for you to be happy again. Wait. This isn't fair to you, John. What? I don't think. That this is gonna work out. Oh. It's just not meant to be. It was worth a shot. You're a really good man John. You know, you're gonna make someone really happy. But not you. Thanks for understanding. Mike, hey, have you seen Sean? I haven't been able to get a hold of him. I thought he was on his way to see you. No, I haven't seen him. Oh, let me try him. Hey Sean. Hey what's going on, man? I got Ali here looking for you. Ah, okay. Yeah I see. All right, bye. He's okay? Yeah, he's. He said. Mike, where is he? Hey, Sean. I've been looking for you. You found me. Sean there's something that I need talk to you about. Remember that day at the carnival, after the whole Ferris Wheel incident, I was there looking for Madame Zoe, the fortune teller? It was because of something that she told me. Because she said I would need to find a new apartment, and that I would need a new job. And that I should be on the lookout for my soulmate, some guy named John. Why are you telling me all this? My friends and I, we put together a list of every John that we knew. And then they gave me this dating calendar and I went a long with it. And I don't know why I did, I really shouldn't have. And then it turned into this fiasco, where I was going out on a date every night. So, every one of those dates you went on was with someone named John? I didn't want to give Madame Zoe's fortune a second thought, but then my apartment flooded and then needed to find a new job. And I thought that there might be something to it. You know, I know that sounds crazy. Yeah, it does. But I don't want it to be that way. I broke off my date tonight because I wanted. You break all your dates with a kiss? You see that? Apparently I wasn't supposed to. Sean, it is not what you think. No, then what is it? It's just that, he not the right one. Well I'm sure there are plenty more Johns out there. You're gonna make a great EMT, Ali. It's fine, at least now I can focus completely on class. It's rigorous but. You know what I mean. Thank you so much for everything. I'm tired of being around Mr. Doom and Gloom. So what if your name isn't John. You liked her right? I mean you really like her? Yeah, I really did. There are some men who are good at communicating what they want. But more often than not, we're taught to stay strong, be tough in the face of sadness. It's like we are supposed to put up a false bravado when grappling with emotions. That's surprisingly deep. Most of us aren't always able to share our worries and fears and frustrations with others. We all need a woman we can open up to, someone kind and understanding, we can be vulnerable with. And you need to open up to her. I know you've been hurt before, I know. But you gotta give her a chance. It's a lot more quieter with Ali gone. You hear from her? No, not since she moved to her new place. I need some chocolate. Okay. Everything okay? Oh, this isn't good. Oh no. Do we need to go to the hospital? That might be a good idea. Okay, all right. Okay, come on. Oh, no, no, no, it's worse when I stand. Okay. Call 911. - Okay, all right. - And then call Brian. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna lie down now. Yes, yes, yes, okay. Oh, mind my feet, thank you. It can't be. Breathe. Okay. Oh, okay. You've gotta be kidding me. Oh, let them in. - Okay. - Hey Brooke. Hi. Hi Sean. Hi. You're still in your second trimester, right? How far apart are your contractions? Are they pretty regular? Usually every 15 to 30 seconds, but some as long as two or three minutes. Okay, let's get you as comfortable as possible and see if they subside as you change positions. Alison, I was expecting you. It looks like your blood pressure's back to normal. So they weren't contractions? Did you have Braxton-Hicks with either of your previous pregnancies? No. Braxton, who, what? It's like when your uterus rehearses for delivery. The contractions are infrequent and irregular and usually subside as you change positions. Real labor contractions are longer, stronger and get closer together the more you're near labor. Just try to stay off your feet for a while. Give your doctor a call. Try and avoid stress. You can help me avoid stress by making things right with Ali. She doesn't care if your name is Sean, John, Jacob, Alice. She wants you. She does. Yeah. Maybe you need to go find her. Sean, I realize that I may have been a little blinded by trying to find a guy named John, rather than seeing what you and Ali have together. I just love Ali and I want what's best for her. So I'll find out where she is. Helen. Brian. It's okay, it's okay, false alarm. I'm so sorry, I cam as fast as I could. Wow you look fantastic in this sweater. Oh babe, thanks. Not everything you said came true. It's not possible. Was written in the stars and must be so. The first two predictions came true, but the third one. There is no John for me. What did you say? That there is no John for me. I'm meant to be with Sean. That is what I said, Sean. Wait, what? Spell his name for me. S-E-A-N, Sean. Are you serious? That's not what it sounds like you're saying. I remember you. I'm so sorry about what happened last time. Do you want a free ride? Sure, why not. Thanks. Hold up. I thought you wouldn't get on one of these things again. What are you doing here? Looking for you. Why were you looking for me? I wanted to say I'm sorry. You shouldn't be the one apologizing. I'm the one who had my priorities all mixed up. I didn't see what I had right in front of me. I was wrong to turn away from you so quickly. I was just hurt and trying to protect myself. You know, what you saw that night, it's not what you think. The only John worth dating, I told him I didn't wanna see him any more so he kissed me to try and change my mind. Why did you break up with him if you were supposed to end up with a John? Because I finally found someone that I did want to be with. Me too. I mean, with you. All the time we've spent together, its felt so natural. Like nothing's missing anymore. I feel the same. Even though my name's not John? It's a funny story about that. It turns out, it was you, all along. Sorry, I know how to fix it now, just give me a minute. It's okay, we're good up here. More than good.
