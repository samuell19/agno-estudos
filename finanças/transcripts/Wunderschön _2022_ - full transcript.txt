Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Our "perfectly strong" campaign is all about being authentic. Creating new role models. We want to see real people like you and me in front of the camera. Beautiful I just love the products. They make me feel so confident. - Beautiful. - Invincible. - We're strong. Strong women. - Yes, we feel beautiful and strong. Milan! We're just ourselves. We don't care what anyone thinks. We make our own rules. This shit... Friday breakfast We are... 10 minute break! What's going on? What are you doing? What? I... I thought it had been a while... Since... Oh! Right. No. Thanks, Iâ€œ I'm not really... thanks. Oh, right. - It has nothing to do with you. - No, it's fine. I... Then I'll... I'll... make breakfast. Okay. Thank you. Hey! What the hell! What a... Nice ass. No, no, no. No, no, no, no! - Shit, got anything for a potbelly? - Sure. - What is it? - Prucalopride, it's a great laxative. If you need a prescription, I have a contact. It's easy. Really? Awesome, thanks. Need a pick-me-up? It keeps you laughing. No, thanks. I'm doing enough coke already. Daddy! - Daddy's on the phone. - I don't want to wear the tights. They're all I've got. Look, they're thin. Now put them on. Sorry, it was important. Soma. - Sonja! - Yes? - I got the promotion? - Really? Great. Put them on, piet. - Piet, that's enough now! - Why are you so annoyed at him? - He won't put his tights on. - Yeah, but he's four. - Besides, it's summer. - The washer is still broken. Oh. Sorry, Sonja. Sorry, it slipped my mind. Stop crying like a girl. I don't want to wear the tights. They itch. Luke Skywalker always wears tights. Even in the desert. You want to be like Luke Skywalker, right? Okay. Have you thought any more about the wall? I don't understand what it is with you and that wall. We would finally have a bit more space when the children come. They never come anyway. - What are you doing? - I have to go to the office. Thilo needs me for... Something or other. They send me into retirement, then can't cope without me. Do you want some coffee? I'm late. Stupid old thing. Excuse me. Yes? - Did you just whistle at me? - What? It's just that... I just... I've always wanted that. For a total stranger to find me really hot, on the spur of the moment. It's a huge compliment. Every woman wants it, and today, I'm the chosen one. Now I'm all... Now... Now I'm all... Now... My legs are spreading all by themselves. No. Let's see... maybe like this? Oh, god. - Morning, Vicky. - Morning. Morning. I meant the car, actually. - But if I can help... - You're not needed here. I know an awful lot about engines. I oil my own. Okay. - See you around. - I can hardly contain the excitement. Vicky! Vicky! - Hi. - Listen, were you just talking to the new teacher? Really? - They'll take anyone these days. - You two should go out. - Why? - Well, because he's really hot. Oh, you mean for procreation. Okay, then. I'll put my life on hold and raise his kids just because he's a genetic a+. You and your weird "I prefer being alone" act. That's cheating. Don't you want to try being a normal person again? There are good relationships, Vicky. How's the divorce going? Count yourself lucky you got out. Seriously. There's nothing more stupid than a woman in love. And once you've focused your attention on your vagina, I want you to imagine that you're peeling an orange with it. Breathe in. Connect with your pelvic bone. And then push, keep pushing, applying constant pressure. And we push our orange... Out. Great. - Sorry, I'm weaning her. - Really? Why so early? - So she sleeps through the night. - I didn't breastfeed long either. - I don't want to ruin my breasts. - So get a mommy makeover. - What's that? - A mommy makeover. My colleague had one. She's good as new. She has the labia of a 16-year-old. I'd do it right now if I had the money. Honestly, for me right now, sex is like throwing a salami down a hallway. She had everything done? Her tummy too? Yes, her love channel too. I'd never go under the knife. What? I'm just disciplined. Being a mother doesn't mean you have to let yourself go. I'm too tired to exercise. Does anyone have a cookie? You give her sugar? That's insane. She isn't even one yet. Everything she needs until she's two is in your milk. It's a drug, you know. I thought that when he took early retirement and the kids were gone, we 'd get a second chance. I can't remember the last time he really looked at me. Maybe try wearing something other than... Beige. - Then maybe he'll see you. - At some point, I turned invisible. God! You can do something about that. You think the way we look now is supposed to be sexy? No! God was a misogynist. I mean, we bleed, we give birth, we sweat... And in the end, he leaves us with bodies like these. He didn't realize we'd want to have a little fun too. Typical man. That's why we have to take things into our own hands. Nobody wants to see old ladies with shriveled cleavage. It's not pretty. I'm pragmatic about it. My breasts were saggy, I was miserable. Now they're fixed and I'm happy. And so is my husband. Cheers! Nobody comes here before 11, frauke. Come on, we've no time to lose! You'll be 60 next year, my dear! It can't be over already. So do a dance course, if you insist on being old-fashioned. - A dance course? - Everyone's doing it. Go for it! But Botox is effective against depression. It's been proven. No, Picasso just isn't for me. I've never liked him. Say what you like, but honestly... I mean, what's that about? Why are they staring at each other? Are they sad they're fat? I don't see two women. It's a woman and her reflection. But they look completely different. Exactly. And that's why the essay "why have there been no great woman artists?" By Linda nocklin... nochlin... Was a seminal moment for feminist art history. Yes, pauline. Great! Thank you very much for that... Wonderful presentation about an important woman, an early campaigner for an equal future in the art world. Any other questions? Can I sit back down? Yes. Tomorrow, we start our projects, which we've all been looking forward to so much. After going through your suggestions... - "Drawing a giant weenie". Thanks, Tim. - No problem. "3D-printed pugs". And my personal favorite, "let's Netflix". I've decided to choose a topic myself. "The power of images: Public representation of women's bodies from the renaissance to the present." Great, another man-hater topic. - I can't take any more. - I mean, get over it. - Pick up the tempo, quasimodo. - Leave her alone, Alina. Oh! God, I didn't mean you. Off you go. Sorry. Hey there! What are you doing here? You hungry? Okay! Tasty breakfast! Finally. God, I'm starving. I was at a shoot half the night. I wish I could say what it was for, but it's a secret. But first things first! Is it okay to give a cat soy milk? Can cats drink soy milk? - What are you doing? - Can you close the lid, please? Please. Don't you have parents? - What if the garbage truck comes? - They come Thursdays at 10 am. Okay. Hello, everyone. I have some news. There's a new ad out. I'm so proud to have been part of the "perfectly strong" family for so long. So: And... swipe up! Have fun. Our "perfectly strong" campaign is all about being authentic. We wanted real faces. It's all real. That's the most important thing. Hey, you! Excuse me! Can you throw me the ball, please? "I make my own baby food, even though I work full time." "And I pluck daisies with my coochie." You spend too much time with brain dead people. Forget those mommy groups. This is what I meant, you're in a relationship trap. The only fan of your life is evolution. It's doing fist pumps. You need to go back to work. Wait a second. Here. Hanno. Great guy. Shame he's gay. He works in one of those... Consultancy type things. Like you did before. A firm. They want to hire women. Then it won't be such a long break as it was with... Piet. You're welcome. How would that work? Milan has so much stress at work, and now this promotion... Women have to make demands, or nothing ever happens. Oh, god. I wasn't even happy for him. Hello? Focus! - It's a financial decision too. - To stay financially dependent on him? It's not so simple. Families stick together. Speaking of which, had any sex recently? How can we? I've got kids clinging to me, I'm tired. I don't have time to exercise. I feel fat and ugly... I've turned into an old mom. So stop behaving like one. Look, there's daddy! We're going to surprise him! Shit. Sorry, I just drank half a gallon of water. - Last time she was smaller, right? - A good half an inch. Sorry. Like I said, I drank loads of water. - Waist 25". - We need to alter her comp card. Okay. Julie, "perfectly strong" didn't renew. What? But... why? Did they say? Your look isn't in. Even the commercial stuff is about uniqueness now, it's just not you. It's been stagnating too long. We need a new strategy. - Okay. - You take four weeks out, get a personal trainer, then we go to the b market. Let's see if I find something for you there. That's our next step. I'm not ready to do catalogue shoots, I want to be on a catwalk. A catwalk, Julie. Everyone wants that. Don't be naive, you're almost 25. - If it hasn't worked out by now, it won't. - I can do it. I'll lose weight. I'll go where you send me. Just let me try, please. Fine, if you like. Let's try again. A scout from the Asian market is coming on Friday. Maybe they'll take you. - But your measurements need to go down. - I can do that by Friday, I promise. Don't get lazy now. This is your last chance, Julie. Thank you, gabo. Hey, Natasha. Can you give me your contact for the prescription? Are you sure this is right? What, are you a doctor now? No, it's just that... It's a hefty cocktail. I'm sick, asshole. Okay. Now I have to listen to your shit? You don't know me. Right, sorry. Scan the prescription, hand out the drugs. It can't be that hard. Unbelievable. - Pom-pom? - I'm in the kitchen. What's that? So you don't burn your fingers anymore. What's all this? What's the occasion? I just thought now you're not working, every day is a special occasion. What's wrong? Nothing. You're acting strange. I'd like to do a dance course with you. A what? I think it's important for us to do something together. We're always doing things together. You barely look at me anymore. Oh, come on. Of course I look at you. You're right there. Tango. It's already paid for. Is it too late to cancel? It starts on Wednesday. I'll be right there, honey. It's okay! Shit. I'll be right there, honey. It's okay. Shit. Oh, god... Shit, shit, shit... Visual representations of bodies have always been used to create an ideal standard. It has never been so detailed and precise as it is today. I want us to do an experiment. Everyone take a pen, and draw a picture about yourself. Color the things you like red. Now take a blue pen and color everything you don't like blue. Alina, what came to mind for your self-portrait? Yeah... I colored my hair red, and my lips. Yeah. And the rest is blue. Your ass is totally red too. - Tim, what did you color red? - Everything. I am red! Congratulations. Asian, you're filming? Great idea. Please do it all week. Did anyone draw something that has nothing to do with looks? Interesting, isn't it? That you immediately think of your looks. Let's take that idea further. Our self-image determines our self-esteem. If it only includes our outward appearance, that means our looks determine our worth. But are your looks all there is to you? Hey, you! Sorry, I... I wanted to, to... The website says to just drop by. Ever held a baseball bat before? A long time ago, as a little kid. - What's your name? - Leyla. Okay then. Change. Wow! Center field! Hallelujah. Okay then. - Ah, the girl from the dumpster. - Have you seen my cat? - That's a cat. - It's my cat. She's not yours. She belongs to the building. She has diarrhea. Can you help me? I have a dad, but he's looking after my little brother. Okay. - This is silly. - What? Everything's fine. The connection in tango isn't a matter for the head. In tango, the connection is between our hearts. The man leads, the woman follows. If the man rushes, the connection breaks. If the woman doesn't pay attention... The connection breaks. We have to be mindful of one another. It's an interplay of attraction and distance. Love, deske, jealousy and trust. It's the dance of life. Everyone can tango. - May I? - God, no. I can't. Just concentrate on the connection between us. Step... That's it. And... step! And go. Free your minds, connect your hearts and dance with feeling. - That's tango. - What nonsense. Come on, we're leaving. I can't listen to this rubbish any longer. It's ridiculous. - Sorry, I... he's not feeling well. - It's okay. What nonsense. Have a nice evening, miss Schiller. Excuse me. - You said you're good with cars? - Yes. Can you... push? Wait. Wait, before I forget. This is just about sex. Just this one time. Okay? What? I don't want to ruin the mood, but while we're on the topic... One-off sex just isn't me. Sorry. Oh, right. Okay. Then... I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. - Have a nice evening. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. - What is that? - Makeup. It gives your skin an even tone. And this one? That's for your cheeks. - Is that for your lips? - Toni, stop that. I have to concentrate. Why do you wear makeup? No idea. It's just what women do. Doesn't your mom wear it? My mommy's in heaven. Come here, I'll do it for you. Okay. - Is that okay? - Yes, everything's okay. - Does it hurt? - No, only a little. - Keep going. - Okay. Does it feel different? - I... I don't think so. - Okay. Sorry, I didn't... that was just... - It was just air, it came from... - It's okay. Oh, god. What's wrong? It's no big deal. Oh, come on. It's normal. Normal that after having two kids, my vagina farts? Real sexy. But they're two adorable children. Come on, Sonja, feed her. Just this once, please. - We have to stick to it now. - And I have to sleep. - I want to sleep through the night. - But I have to work. Right, I forgot. I'm on a maternity holiday. I just drink coffee with my friends and my adorable kids. Mommy. Come on, I'll put you back to bed. Leyla? - Morning. - Good morning. What are you doing here? You were snoring too loudly again. I couldn't sleep. - It's after ten o'clock. - What? Why didn't you wake me earlier? - The store won't go broke if you're late. - Right, wolfi. Everything I do is silly. Okay, great. Liposuction would definitely be an option in this area. We could help out a little here too. The tummy tuck scar would be down here. But don't worry, this kind of reconstructive surgery is routine. We can fix it. - We talked about the breast lift. - Yes. We offer it with or without implants. But we have to wait three to six months after you stop breastfeeding. And, um... what about the... Love channel? - A vaginal tightening? - Yes. Can you do that too? Or is it more of a muscular thing? You can get dressed. We don't offer vaginal tightening surgery. I consider it dubious. We simply don't know the risks yet. But there are less invasive procedures. Like the thermal method. How does that work? We take a device which looks a bit like a vibrator. It's inserted, and then we carry out a controlled burning inside. Of course, these procedures involve some temporary pain, but nothing which wouldn't usually subside after a few weeks. Take some time to think it over. We can help put things right again so that you can enjoy motherhood. Price: From 7,900 Euros our aim is always to make you feel great again. Okay. Yes, Milan. I need 7,900 Euros to... To make me feel great again. No, no. I just need it, okay? It's none of your business, I don't need permission. Shit. We'll be home in a minute. It's okay. Yeah, yeah. Are you so busy? Is the world too slow for you? Don't want to be late for the red light? Yeah. Yes. You're so hungry, aren't you? Come on, honey. Yes, I know. It's okay. What? Hello? About the interview? Yes, hello. Yes! Yes, that's right. Thanks for calling back. Yes, I got your name from Vicky... From Victoria Schiller. Yes, great. Yes. Tomorrow? Tomorrow... yes, that's no problem. Tomorrow at 8.30 am. Okay then. Thank you very much. I look forward to it. See you soon, bye. Thank you, bye! Yes! You drew a self-portrait with the things you like and dislike about yourselves. The renaissance saw the first great golden age of portrait painting. It was about showing people for who they are. What defines them. This was often symbolized by an object. Leyla, what would you say defines Mia? Why Leyla? I don't think she talks. She's mute or something. - This'll take a while. - She never speaks. Well, I think... Mia really understands people. Somehow, she's really good at talking to people. And she's fair. Most of the time. Fascinating, isn't it? How much people can see. For the next class, I want you to find out what defines you. What you're good at, what you're interested in. What's your object? Okay, I'm prepared to offer sex two times. - You liked the watermelon? - Yes. Okay. Sex two times and one date. Okay, if we have to. Hello. So, you'd like to cancel the course? Can I take the course alone? With feeling! On five, men, put your feet together, shift your weight. And on five, the women cross. Again! Kick up your heels, ladies. Go, go, go! Heels up! And back again! Faster! Carlotta, heels up! And shuffle right! Come on, shuffle! A bit faster! Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go. And now back, knees up! - Sorry! Are you okay? - It's okay. Knees up! Leyla, come on! Knees up! I... I forgot something. Okay. Julie bode? Sure. Sorry. What do you mean, you can't reach her? - Hello, dear. - Hello, mom. Have you seen my hormone tablets? I'm dying. - Where have you been? - Study group. Yes, zaree! I wanted to ask if I could pick up a prescription on the way. I ordered food for you, don't wait for me. Yes. Oh, that's great. Thank you. I'm on my way. - Hello, mom. - Hello, sweetie. Come in. Everything okay? You look good. Is Milan here? Yes. He's upstairs putting the kids to bed. I'll be away for three hours tops. You've got milk in the fridge. I have to work, Sonja. I have a full schedule. It's not so easy. - So take a sick day. - I just got promoted. I have to perform. It's just this once. You always say you want more time with the kids. I do. What's the interview for? Alba hasn't started daycare yet. How can you work? Why me? They're not just my children. Once again, I'm the nagging mom. I didn't say that. I'd love to laugh at your stupid jokes again. What? I hope you have enough space. It's a little cramped. Everything's wonderful, dear. Not so much, mom. Thanks. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm not hungry. I already ate. - Of course. - It's chicken. It's lean. I made it for you. Leave her be, frauke. The kids are grown up. Sorry, mom. I have a lot of castings at the moment. I need to be in shape. You're already pretty enough. Milan, that's great news. Congratulations on the promotion. Thanks, dad. But it's no big deal. Nonsense. You've earned it. You've been working really hard. Let's drink to that. Maybe you can finally buy your own place. A house with a garden is great for a family. That was always important for me. I know. I'm trying. But that's clearly not enough. - Yeah, right. - Pass it along. And why not? Would changing my look be an option? Okay. Right, I understand. So now it's catalogues... Okay then... yes. - I thought you enjoyed it. - Enjoy? It's not a hobby. I keep telling you that if you want to go out, just say. I can help out. - How nice of you, helping me with my kids. - Here we go again. Right, shall we? Sorry. - Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's great. Right, then. Bon appetit. - I hope it's all okay. - Of course it is. I do a lot as well. But I also have a job. I earn the money, Sonja. Okay? If you insist on working now, we should have planned for it before you got pregnant. Sorry, but you have to cancel the interview. Is everything okay, guys? Yes, everything's fine. I'm really happy. I finally have the chance to be more than a milk dispenser, and your forward-thinking son understands that it's his turn to look after his kids. Sorry, frauke. I've lost my appetite. - What's going on with you two? - Stay out of the kids' business. I went to so much trouble and now nobody's eating. Don't get so excited. Sorry. Your mother isn't doing so well right now. Sorry for asking. It's not your fault. But now we can go clubbing. - Great idea, Julie. - Come on, please. Please! It's been so long. Take your little sister to a models' party. Don't be so boring. Want a beer? Your mother didn't buy any. Dance Julie. What's wrong? Hello. Hello. I... Everything's fine. Don't worry about it. Come on, go away now. Go away. I'll see you later. Off you go! Yeah. See you later. The one in the middle, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. Okay. The milk's in the fridge. The first bottle's already warm. - I'll be back in three hours. - Are you serious? Bye, kiddo. Sonja, you can't just... - Blast off! - Piet, that's enough of the astronaut act. Child care Shit. Shit. - Sonja? - Hello! - Hello. - Hi! - I'm hanno. - Nice to meet you, hi. - Okay, right this way. - Okay. And change feet. Back, side, forward, side. And change feet. Back, side... I'll show you again with the music. Okay, okay! Good grief. Hi. Is mom home? Hello. She's at work. - Oh, right. Shit. - What's wrong? I have to go to work. Shit, what do I do now? - Where's Sonja? - At an interview. Don't ask. The contact, the embrace - gets more intense. - Right, then. - Then... leave her here. - The woman gets faster... - With you? - Don't you think I'm up to it? Can you change a diaper? Seriously? Toni... I brought you some sugar pasta. When school finished, she was the first to stand up, run quickly down the stairs and... Why don't they want you anymore? Because I don't look right. What does right look like? No idea. Taller, more striking. Special. And... why did you sleep on the stairs? I don't know. Why were you lying in the dumpster? I wanted to know how my mom feels. I dug a hole in the sandbox too, but I was too scared to get in. Is your mom in heaven too? No, my mom's still alive. The pasta's ready! I love sugar pasta. It's my favorite food. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. We waste all of our energy on an impossible task. And end up missing out on the best thing: Finding out who we are and taking charge of our lives. As long as we strive for an ideal, we're distracted. We miss the movie because we're caught up in the ads. Bring your objects next time. We'll do our self-portraits. I'm looking forward to your stories. Do you need something? I'd like to renegotiate. Nope. Sex twice, one date. It was a good deal. But we could just keep going. Sorry, I'm the wrong person for that. I don't believe in the whole relationship idea. What idea? Sorry, I've just never seen it work out. Hey. - You're new, aren't you? - Yes. I saw you training. You're awesome. Thanks. Are you coming to the team party tonight? I think so. Cool. Yeah. You can do as many ochos as you like. Step. Step. Then maybe a brief pause. There are no rules. Just your instincts. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, frauke. - Bye. Sorry. Follow requested Leon has accepted your request Leyla? Leyla! What are you doing in here? I'm going to a party. And so... And so I wanted to see if I could maybe borrow one of your dresses. Oh! Oh. Who do you want to look pretty for? - Mom, it doesn't matter, it's... - No! Sorry, I'm just happy that my little baby is growing up. Oh, god. It doesn't matter, I'll stay like this. No! Stop underselling yourself. You're a pretty girl. I'll help you. What kind of party? It's a school thing. I only have... What size are you? 12? 14? I've got a fluttery number here. Where is it? I can't take them to daycare. Why don't you get it? How's it supposed to work? I have early flights to catch. Yeah, so talk to your boss. I'm exhausted too, Sonja. Why this change all of a sudden? All of a sudden? Before piet, we said I'd stay at home to start with. Then those assholes let me go because they didn't want me part-time. Then came alba, and now it's been four years. And you just assume nothing will change for you while everything changes for me. Honestly, what were you thinking? I just assumed that if you needed something, you'd say something first. Great, great. So now I'm the nagging old woman. Why do I have to ask for it? Did you ask me if you could take the promotion? No. But it goes without saying that I'll pick up the slack, right? All of this shit. - What are you even doing? - Washing. The washer is still broken. Oh, god. I can't do this anymore, Milan. What? What can't you do anymore? I want my kids to see me smile. Come on, stop exaggerating all the time. I'm going to do it. It's a real chance for me. Hey. - Where are you going? - Sorry. I think I'm going to leave. This dress was a really dumb idea. I think you look good. Here. I'm getting a cramp in my hand. Thanks. Oh, god. No! Oh, god. Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry! - I don't need sleep. - Did it get worse? - Yes, it's really annoying. - Okay, and back, back... Back! Ali, come forward. Let's speed it up, come on. We... we can't go that way. What? Why not? - Because... because it stinks there. - It stinks? Why? The lake. The lake is eutrophied. - Eutro what? What lake? - Eutrophied. Heidi, please! Okay, yes. Okay, I see. Yes, okay. Mom Shit, shit, shit... Hair removal cream which one gives me a rash again? It doesn't matter. I'll never have sex again anyway. Sonja, stop whining. You have to show a bit of stamina. How are you going to get out of the trap if you keep giving up? It's just so much. How can one person do it all? Maybe people change when they have kids. Yes. Women do. Men just keep living their lives. Give the feminist crap a rest. - I'm not "women". - All right... Being a mom is tough work. It just isn't paid. If men did it, it'd be the best paid job in the world. You think so? What? Do you think Milan has it better than you? Would you prefer to swap? What? Would you give up your life in exchange for his? You don't have the slightest idea, Vicky. Yeah, okay. - I'm trying to help, Sonja. - More pressure doesn't help. "You have to work more. You have to have sex." "You have to accept your body." But I'm not okay with my body. I want my proper body back. - Your proper body? - Yes, this one's a wreck. Look. What's that? Did you go to a plastic surgeon? Yes. It's my body. I can do what I want with it. That's what you want, right? That's emancipation. If I want new tits, then I'll buy some. Shit. Come on. Get down. Get down, please. Come with me. Come on. - Come on. - What are you doing? I'm carrying a baby. Just come, please. - What was that about? - Nothing. Do you have cash on you? Vicky! - Everything good with you? - Yeah. Yeah... I'm good. I have to... I'm in a hurry. Two packs of hair removal cream. Will that be all? Yes. See you tomorrow. See you. 11.70, please. Okay. Thank you. Vicky? Vicky! Vicky! He's a colleague. - Vicky! - My students would call him my fuck boy. No way! David Ortiz, of course. What? My dad watched all his games. He was his hero. I have to... it's really late, I have to go home. - What? I didn't want to... did I... - No, no. It's fine, really. I just have to feed the cat. You're so brave! I'm getting incredible feedback. Everyone loves your new look. You look so confident. - They want you to do an editorial. - What? - Really? - Yes. It's great, just great. Very edgy and strong. You're in great shape. You did great. We'll push this look, and maybe even get you onto the catwalk. Hello? Don't forget social media. Do a story. Something emotional about yourself. Which airport? Okay, I will. Julie? Turn around again. I don't have a cat. We could just watch a series. - Mom? - I'm here. - What happened to you? - What's this? - Where's your hair? - What are you doing here? I... I tried calling you. I thought I'd... - Why don't you have any hair? - Why are you packing up my room? I just thought I'd like a room for myself. And... Have you lost your mind? Couldn't you ask first? Don't take that tone with me. You don't respond to my calls. You're never here anyway. Why not take Milan's room? Don't I matter anymore? I see. I'm just stupid little Julie. I get it. - That's not true, Julie. - This is my room! What do you need it for, stress-relief pottery? You do nothing all fucking day anyway. That's enough. Don't take that tone with me. I'm your mother. Show some respect. I gave up everything for you kids. I was always there for you. I cooked and washed, healed your wounds and suffered sleepless nights. Until there was nothing left of me. It's enough! Do you see? It's enough! It's my turn now! I want something for myself! It's my right. I'm not just a doormat to wipe your feet on, who nobody respects. Get out of here! Get out! Okay, fine. You've lost your mind. - Not today, Toni. - But... I said no! I don't have time for your shit right now. Understood? Yeah, get out! Mommy. Piet, why are you still awake? Can you read me a story? Okay. Okay. Come on. "The doctor fixes gitti's leg." After her surgery, the nurse brings her back to her room. Her mom sleeps there with here. "In the evening, daddy comes to visit." Exactly. There it is. In writing. It explains everything perfectly. All men are doctors. And the women are just nurses. They clean up the poo. And daddy only comes in the evening, because he works. Not like mom. She can stay all day, relaxed and caring. By choice. Because she has nothing else to do with her life. It's important that you understand how it all works from an early age. Otherwise it gets all messed up. That's why they write it out so clearly in children's books, so it's all clear. Remember that, do you understand? Aren't you coming to bed? No, I have to finish this. - Okay. - Yeah. We're the... linas! You can book us for humorous stress relief. I've made a bunch of short films with this software here. It's, like, my talent. So I wanted to show you something. Check me out, bro, without a doubt, yo one day, this guy'll be number one. - I can beat box too. - Shit, now the software has crashed. This could take a while. Can I show you later? Yeah. These are my clubs. I practiced every day. When I did the spin, my kneecap... Kind of got stuck at the front. And... since then, I just don't know anymore. My dad always wanted to be a baseball player. But... he wasn't good enough. He dragged me and my mom to loads of games. It was really great. But then he left us and went back to america. To his new family. My mom sent me to ballet classes. She wanted me to do something else. But... I wasn't any good at it. Now I play baseball again. I have strong shoulders. You need them. Hey, miss Schiller. What's your object? - My object? - Yeah. In my case, it's more of a mosaic. Fuck boy? What? You know what? I really like you, and you like me too. That doesn't happen often. And when it does, you don't just run away. It doesn't happen often? Sorry, but that's such a clichÃ©. Right now, within a three mile radius, 20,000 people are saying those words to each other. And they all think they're really special and chosen. After four months, when the chosen-one hormone leaves the body, they all notice, whoops! They're all caught up with one another. Nobody can see out, and nothing's fun. And while the "relationship" consumes everything, life in all its glory passes behind your back. But you're not allowed to join in, because you're too busy standing too close to someone else, right on their feet. And they all hurt each other. That's a fact. Yet I still like standing here with you. It feels good. That's a fact too. And I don't feel the slightest need to get away from you just because we might turn into a cliche one day. Sometimes that can be a gift. But if you won't open the gift, neither can I. And that... that's unfair! Listen, I don't know... My strengths lie elsewhere. I'm good at other things. Not at love, at other things. - But you already do. - What? You already love me. Are you crazy? You don't get to say that. Who would say a thing like that? God! Piet! Piet! Come on. That's enough bath time now. Right. Jeez. Mommy, you're broken there. - Where? - There. That's right. Should I make it better? Okay, quickly. But then you're going to bed. Right. Where does it hurt? Here, here, and here. Don't worry, it will all be fine. Feeling better? Why are you crying then, mom? It's nothing, everything's okay. So then why are you crying? - I just forgot something. - What did you forget? I forgot that you kids were inside there once. Did we make you all broken? Come here. You're the best, most wonderful and important thing in the world. Okay. Beautiful! More of the cold shoulder. Yes, awesome. Great. Hey, do you need a break? You seem low on energy. No, sorry, I'm fine. And now more condescending. Yes, awesome. Great. Seductive! You look pretty. Piet wanted to paint. Am I an egotistical asshole hermit? You're not an egotistical asshole hermit. But you can be annoying. - Okay, thanks. - No problem, don't mention it. If that stupid surgery makes you happy, I'll go with you and be there for you. I guess you know I'd rather help in some other way, but... You're my family, and I love you. I love you too. - I don't want the surgery. - Really? Oh, thank god! I'd have stuck that stupid doctor's scalpel in his chest... I don't know if that's legal. It's a gray area. - Won't you ask me in? - Yes. - Alba and piet are in here. - Okay, I'll go this way then. - Leyla, are you there? - Shit. - Is your stuff downstairs? - Yes, why? - Shit. Get up, now! - But we're not doing anything. Why is she...? What's going on? What's this? - Who's this? - Hi. Leon brabandt. I play baseball with Leyla. Mom... Baseball? - Get out. - What? Why? - I said get out. - He's not going. - It's okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - You won't see her tomorrow. It's over. Come on, let's go. Are you serious, Leyla? Baseball? You're a baseball player? Sorry. You think your dad will take an interest in you again? He abandoned us for his new fucking family and his new fucking kids. He doesn't give a shit about us. Don't forget that. Of course not. How could I? How could I forget it? I see him every day in the mirror. I see how you look at me. I get it, okay? I know I'm not good enough for you. But you know what? I don't care. I don't have to do what you want or be who you want. I just want to be me. Hello, tweety. Where did you come from? Oh, shit. Toni, go inside. Toni, look after your brother. I love dirty dancing! He's such a great dancer. It's not about how well he dances. Why does nobody get it? I've never met anyone who can love the way Johnny does. He just wants her to be free. Sure, but you also just wish you could be in her place for that lift. My mother just called. It's Julie. How... how does it look? She was revived, but her blood pressure keeps dropping. She's very weak. And she isn't... She isn't stable yet. Oh, god! Oh, no. "Gitti helps mom with the spring cleaning." Okay... You can see her now. I didn't see it, Sonja. It's not your fault, Milan. I wasn't there. I'm never really there anymore. I don't know what we're doing, Sonja. I don't want to lose us. Me neither. I kissed another man. What? Okay. And now? Are you feeling better now? Are you done? Your romantic daydreams have to stop, frauke. We need to pull ourselves together. You're not 20 anymore. I'm not 80, either. I'm not dead yet. And I'm not happy, wolfi. Are you leaving me? We've been apart for a long time. I'm going back to the hospital, to Julie. I want to be with her when she wakes up. Good job girl! You rock! Get well soon. Love, gabo. Breakfast. But it's so little. Yeah, that's just how it looks if we both work part-time. But can we stay in this apartment? Or is that too expensive too? We'll manage it. This year, anyway. We'll just have to skip a holiday. You have to start dyeing your own hair. You have to buy cheap shirts and iron them yourself. Dry cleaning is expensive! We're going to be poor. And ugly. But we have time. And we're together. And we love each other. - Oh, thank you. - Shut up. - Piet! - No, not now... - Hey. - The wolf eated alba's leg. Oh, no, sweetie. There aren't any wolves here. Come here. It was just a dream. But when the forest is dark, the wolf comes. Yes, that's when he comes. - There are no wolves here. - Bad wolf... Milan? Are you asleep? What's important is that you don't come to a standstill. The next runner has to recognize the exact moment... And should already be sprinting... When the Baton is passed. Five laps around the field. Off you go! Oh, god! Ouch! - What was that? - The lift. Why didn't you catch me? You have to warn me! Oh, right. Do you want to be one of my objects? Okay. Why? I've been doing some calculations and... On balance, more situations are better when you're there than when you're not. But I still want to do things alone. Often. Often? Often enough. Okay. Reading. Okay. Get a room! Five more laps! Frauke! I saw you were back. I thought it'd be better if you weren't alone. Come on, I'll pour us some wine. Do you have some? Oh, my god. What happened here? Hey. I know you're in there. I wanted to ask if you'll look after our cat until I'm all better. Toni. I'm sorry I scared you like that. It won't happen again, I promise. I'm going to open it now, okay? Frauke, where shall I put the plates? On the table. What's bernt doing? That's nice. Oh, he's making roses. I need help! Bernt, come help. Bernt, come help. Leave me alone. I'm not done. Hi, guys. It's my birthday. I'm 25 years old. A quarter century. Crazy, right? I've spent half of it constantly improving my body. To the breaking point. My agent said to tell you something emotional about myself. My dream, my story. So... here it is. My real story. Every day, we're confronted with what's not right about us. What we still have to achieve. What we have to optimize. From childhood onwards. In ads, in magazines, on social media, among friends, at school, in our families, in our own heads. And we believe that if we look perfect, we'll finally be happy. I can't see otherwise. You can kiss this side. Now let's hear some noise for Leyla zaree! The first pitch. She swings and misses. Strike one. We have to stop feeling bad and worrying that other people might not like us. Just imagine. If we 'd only stop trying to constantly improve ourselves, if it just mattered less how we look. Leyla! Leyla! What would we do with all that free energy and all that free time? Come on, girl. She hits it! Run, Leyla! Go! And she's offi Safe! Safe! The flamingos win! The flamingos win! It probably wouldn't be our dreams that changed. But the world. Spoon... Put the baby monitor away, they're asleep! Maybe it's not loud enough, or we're too far away? What, the 30 feet to the guest room? - Hey, hedgehog. - Hey. You're the hedgehog. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - What will you do now? - I don't know yet. Get healthy first. Hey, where were you? It was Franz's fault. He couldn't decide, and now he looks like this. Hi. Fuck boy. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Still upset? Real sexy. Oh, come on, please dance with me! Okay. - No, no, no. - Come on. What? No. Absolutely not. - Hey, you can't dance at all, can you? - Sure I can, look. Thanks. It's nice like this, without the wall. Yeah. I think so too. Subtitles: Graham wet her all et al.
