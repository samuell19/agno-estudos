[MUSIC PLAYING] -All right, folks. Everybody move it. Let's go. Out of the way. -Get that car out of here. Call the cops. -Folks, move that kid, huh? -Come on. Move that thing, will ya? Come on, people. Ain't you got no jobs? I've got to get out of here. Won't somebody move that thing out the way. I've got to get by here, make some money. -Oh, wait. Oh, darling. You're not going to give me a ticket, are you? -No, not you, Dixie. -I didn't think so. You're my boy. I've got something for your baby too. -Thanks. -Come on, darling. -Say. Do you know who that is? That's Dixie, the number one madame in the whole city. -How about an autograph, Dixie? -Well, you've got it. -Thanks a million. -Come on and see me, you hear? -OK. move that thing. -So long, Dixie. -See ya. -Great. -Oh, there's Dixie. -Well Bernie, Hi. Don't get up, darling You take good care of him, you hear? -Hey, Dix, you need some help? -No. No. I'm OK. Oh, Rita, when you see the toga, you've got to try it on. -Wonderful. Sick Steve Moss is inside, not happy. -Ah, brother. did you call the plumber? -Yeah. Said they were pretty busy, but he'd try to get someone in later this afternoon. -Try? Well, you call him back. You tell him we are having a party for 40 people and that hot tub has to be in working order, period. -Hey, yeah. That's my best moment. Hi, Dix. -Hey, Dixie, been shopping? -What are you doing here this early? -Dr. Ambrose called again. -That's twice in one week. What's going on with you two? -Maybe it's love. -Does he know we charge double for that? -Dixie, Moss is complaining worse than usual. I tried to sell him down, but you better hurry. -Be right there. Come on, girls. I want you to see this. It's spectacular. Huh? Is that sharp or what? All right. Now you guys throw this around. And when the liquor order gets here, I want you to put the tequila aside for the Delacourt party, OK? -Right. And I ordered five pounds of egg salad for the hors d'oeuvres tonight. -Egg salad? Well you know, this is supposed to be a Bacchanalia. People are going to eat with their fingers. -Come on. One tiny little dance? -Not now, Sherry. Try Mr. Hagar. They'll want love and joy, that's what they're here for. -I'm really not much on dancing. -That's all right. Just enjoy the motion. -Steven, darling, I'm sorry I kept you waiting. -Me too. -Did you have a drink, honey? -I'm fine. -The usual? -Your usual? -The usual? -Your usual? -Your usual? -Whatever. -Your usual? -Whatever. -Champagne. -Coming right up. -Dixie, I am upset. I need you and the girls this weekend. -Steven, please I already explained. -I don't think I need to ask for special consideration, Dixie. Given the amount of business I do here, you owe it to me, and not to some no class union baboon like Tony Marchesso. -Anthony Marchesso booked this weekend almost a month in advance and just cause you don't like him. -Well, it isn't that I don't like him, I hate his guts. You could open five houses with the clientele I bring in here. Let's talk about priorities. -Ladies and gentlemen, the Goddess Juno. -Rita, fabulous. Oh, look at this. -Oh, would you even know this was Rita. -Wonderful. I don't think you understand the seriousness of this situation. This is a very important weekend for me, Dixie. I've got two German bankers and the entire staff flying in on Pan Am to finance the largest shopping mall in the whole southeast. I want to entertain them in style. You hear what I'm saying. -I hear you. And I want you to hear me. You are a wonderful customer, Steven, and you deserve the very best I can give you. This weekend is booked. Now, I gave my word, and my customers depend on that. That's what makes them feel safe here, and I will not go back on that, not for you or anybody. -I'm warning you, Dixie. This is no way to run a business. -Nobody tells me how to run my business, Steven, not you or anyone. -Take care of my friend Hagar. You've gone too far this time, Dixie. -Steven. Steven, please. You're being silly. Mr. Hagar, I think you'd better leave. -Dixie, don't less Moss ruin the party. He's always such a downer. -No. No, look I understand. Don't want to cause any more trouble. Thank you both. -Oh, come on, Dix. -I don't like being bullied, Mr. Hagar. But you had nothing to do with it. Sherry's right. We're having a party tonight. We should act like it. Hang around. -All right. -Thank you, Dixie. You're very gracious. -Hello. -Mr. Marchesso, am I interrupting anything? -It's about time. Here you go, doll. Take care. -See you thinks weekend, Tony. Oh, Tony. How's business? -Is he? Fighting management for this, negotiating for that, trying to keep our people working. Recession is tough on the unions. -Ah, hope we're not wearing you out for the weekend. -What are you talking about? Tony Marchesso? I'll see ya some time. Hey, Dixie. -Hm? -Show the girl a good rest. -We'll be ready. -All right. Everybody in here, all of you. Now, we're going downtown. So I want you to be good little girls and move it. Let's go. -Take your hands of me. -Quit shoving. -What the hell is going on down there? -It's a bust, lady. You're under arrest for running a house of prostitution. -Can you believe this horrible man, Dixie? -Moss. Bastard. -What about the hot tub and the party? -So in closing, your honor, I want to stress that it's the victimless nature of my clients offense that warrants special consideration. That the imprisonment of Dixie Cabot would not be in the best interest of society and in fact would serve only to undermine the process of her rehabilitation. -Mr. Gelfand, I understand your argument for leniency. However, your client has a record of three arrests for the same offense. [LAUGHTER] -Ms. Cabot, let me ask you something, why in God's name you keep doing this? [LAUGHTER] -None of that, please. Ms. Cabot? -It's a simple issue, really. You see I don't believe what I do is wrong. -[LAUGHTER] -With all due respect, your honor, I mean, outside that door, there is homicide, there's rape, there's larceny. But in my house, nobody gets hurt, nobody gets robbed, and nobody gets cheated. See I'm a business woman, Your Honor, and no business could prosper the way that mine does unless what I had to offer was both pleasurable and necessary. And I just don't see why it should be illegal to take money for something that it's all right to do for nothing. -Right. -Thank you, Your Honor. -Amazing. Ms. Cabot you have committed felonies under the law. And these laws are expressions of the public will. They reflect our common morality. By violating them repeatedly, you show a flagrant disdain for the rules that bind us all, and that bothers me to no end, Ms. Cabot. I agree with counsel that rehabilitation is probably more important than imprisonment in your case. But I want you to learn something this time, young lady. So I'm not going to send you to jail. -What? -Instead, I'm remanding you to the care and custody of the Sisters of Holy Grace for a period of 90 days. [CROWD RUMBLINGS] But understand this clearly. Any breach of discipline at the convent will result in your immediate transfer to the State prison where you will serve instead a sentence of 180 days. -Your Honor, may I say something? -No. You've said enough. Get thee to a nunnery tomorrow morning. This court is adjourned. -Dixie Cabot in a convent? -It's perfect. No jail. -What am I going to do in a convent? -It's vacation time, 90 days of rest and relaxation. Hell, you'll be running the place within a week, so smile. -Oh. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. [NUNS SINGING] I tell you, Marshall John, you know I'm a city girl, but I can already see how relaxing a couple of months in the country could be. -Beautiful, isn't it? -It's gorgeous. It's going to be perfect. What is that? Is that a nun? -Is that Dixie Cabot? -Yes, Sister. -Good I'll take over now. I'm the Mother Superior. Just climb on up there, dear. Oh, I beg your pardon? -Jump up on that cart. Put the bags back there. We're a little late. -Give me the small one. That's my jewelry. -Just step right up there. Good. Good. That does it. All right. Hang on. -Hey, Sister. What about signing these papers? -I'm Mother Eugenio, Dixie. Welcome to your new home. -Thank you. I'm looking forward to the visit. Quite a little spread you got here. -Yes. It's a good life. We grow everything we eat, and we make pottery too. -I think this is going to be just what the doctor ordered. [INAUDIBLE] What are they doing? -Chores. Everyone has their own. I have to get outside at least two hours a day or I don't feel right. -You do this two hours a day? And you also run the place? -We exercise everything here-- body, mind, and spirit. you won't be bored. One thing, Dixie. No celebrity status, no special treatments. You'll live our lives and do as we do. Just like any other Sister. Agreed? Coming, Dixie? -Oh, ah, right. Yeah. -Sister Theresa, would you take care of tractor for me? I'm afraid I'm behind schedule again. -Oh, sure, Mother. Glad to. -Is mother and baby doing nicely? -Dixie, this is Sister Theresa. -Hi, Dixie. Welcome aboard. -Thanks. Nice to meet you. [PIG SQUEALING] -You'd better say hello to Gulliver too or his feelings will be hurt. -Hi, Gulliver. What is it? -A baby pig. -Oh. Cute little sucker. -Come along, Dixie. I have a guest waiting. -Ah. -Come along, dear. Come on, dear. Make yourself at home, Dixie. Have a lock around if you'd like. I shouldn't be too long. -(SINGING) Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Allelu-- Allelu-- Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. -Hi. How's the television reception here? -We don't have television. -No TV? That's medieval. -How dare you? -What? -If you must be here, the least you could do is show respect. This isn't a bordello. It's a house of God. -Well, pardon me. -That's a little easier said than done, I'm afraid. -Come back here, Sister. -Mary, look. I just received a lovely box of chocolates from Judge Delaney. It's over on the table. -Oh, Eugenio, don't tempt me. -What? I know that sweet tooth of yours. Now I want to hear all Chicago. I want to hear all the news. -Oh, it's wonderful. Couldn't be better. Oh, how I missed you all. I can't wait to see every one at the national council meeting. -Yes. -The council meeting. Isn't it amazing how things turn out. -Things? Sister Mary, what things? Are there any problems? -No. No. No. No problems. Wrinkles perhaps. -Wrinkles. About the council meeting? -No, not specifically. But the meeting itself has been cancelled. -Cancelled? Whatever for? -Oh, the usual financial mishmash. Money. Money. Money. Isn't it always money? -But canceling the national council meetings. Well, I knew we were having financial problems, but I didn't realize it was so serious. -Now nobody said it was serious, Eugenio. For goodness sake. Oh, here. Help me, Eugenio before I eat the whole box. -Sister Mary, how serious is this? -[COUGHING] -Are you all right? Oh. I'm sorry. I don't-- I don't understand. Maybe I should call Mother Eugenio. -No. No. -You sure you're all right? -Ah. I know who you are. I put in a good word for you. I'm Sister Agnes. I used to be the Mother Superior. I'm very influential around here. -Why thank you, Sister Agnes. It's nice to meet you. -What time is it? -Oh, ah it's ah, 10 to. -Oh, my goodness. I've got to get going. -You sure you're all right now? -You have a lovely voice. -Why thank you. -You must read to me some time. -Howdy. -And you say they'll be closing other convents? -Eugenio, I didn't say that. What they're going to do is study the situation and then they'll decide which assets are the most advantageous to liquidate. -Can't we talk about something else? -Sister Mary, we own 60 acres of prime real estate here, the largest assets the order owns. Our convent is in jeopardy, isn't it? -Eugenio, please. Don't do this. -See how perfectly balanced these trees are. Touch one branch and the others bow with it. -Are they going to sell our convent, Sister Mary? -Please, Eugenio, don't ask me that. But it's true. Oh, Eugenio, forgive me. I told them I wasn't the one to come and tell you. -All right. It's all right. -Could I ask you a question? -How tall am I? -No. Ah, actually I was wondering, what do you do with all this stuff? -This is our line of stoneware. -You make it? I mean the nuns. -Well, angels do the actual work. We just put our name on it. -Dumb question, huh? -No. Bad joke. We wear funny clothes and we pray a lot, but all in all we're fairly human. -Oh, I'm sorry. I-- -No. Don't apologize. We're just as nervous being around you. I'm Sister John the Baptist, Sister John for short. -Hey, that's nice to meet you, Sister John. Nice to meet somebody with a sense of humor. -But I have to admit, you're not exactly what I expected. -Well, that makes two of us. -You have any questions, you just feel free to ask. -I do have one. How tall are you? -Dixie? Dixie. Come inside now. Let's get you situated in your room then. We begin prayers tomorrow. Sister Margaret, this is Dixie Cabot. -Yes, Mother. I know. -Sister Margaret, surely you can spare a more generous greeting. -Mother, you know how I feel about this. I'll abide with the majority, but please don't ask me to pretend. -Sister Margaret, Dixie is going to be with us for the next three months. If you're feelings are that strong, I suggest you express them openly. -Very well. I find it appalling bringing someone into this house who represents the most demeaning and loathsome existence a woman can know. I know you see it as a wonderful opportunity for everyone, Mother, but I cannot. We're not social workers, and I don't think anyone is going to benefit from it. -Thank you, Sister Margaret. I appreciate your honesty, as does Dixie, I'm sure. You'll need your bags, Dixie. -All right. I'm coming. I'd never let one of my girls talk to me like that. -We're all equals here. We've all taken the same vows. The Sisters are encouraged to express themselves openly. Come along. -I don't know, Mother. That would never work in my house. Somebody's got to be boss. -I used to feel the same way. Absolute authority. But I've come to appreciate our collegiality. It's brought us out of the Dark Ages in a sense. -Speaking of the Dark Ages, Mother. Is it true you don't have television around here. -That's the least of our needs, I can assure you. -Oh, that's not true. TV is essential. You may be out in the boonies, but you are still part of the world. You've got to know what's going on around you. -We manage. And this is where you'll stay. I think you'll find everything you need. -You know, there are all kinds of-- educational and recreational programs. I mean it's ah-- it's good for the girl's morale, Mother. We'd have a hard time getting through the night without our soaps during the day. -Well, somehow we soldier without them. -Well, what about the news? What about when the president speaks? -If the president says something noteworthy, we ah, get wind of it. -I'll tell you what, Mother Eugenio, why don't I buy you a TV set. Sort of a gift. -I don't mean to misled you, Dixie. This idea of equality doesn't come with your first night's stay. I have a plan for your three months here, and it begins with me continuing as Mother Superior and you learning to surrender to our way. -A 19 incher? -Fight me and you'll be miserable because I'm every bit as stubborn as you are, Dixie Cabot. -Good morning. We have silent prayer in 15 minutes. Just want to be sure you heard the bell. -I heard it. Thanks a million. Oh, you gotta be kidding. Is that it? -It's part. -Underneath it will slip. -Oh. Damnation. -Can someone hand me the [INAUDIBLE] sister? -I can't do this. Forget it. -That's what happens when you don't cut your nails. And you can do it. It takes practice. -Well, I'm not cutting my nails. -Clip them, Sister. We might find you a legitimate profession while you're here. -Yeah. But can I make a living out of it? -And if I had faith, I can move mountains. -Faith doesn't pay the rent in my world, Sister Margaret. -She's got you there, Margaret. -Dan? -Uh-huh. -I don't like this. -Sisters. If I can have your attention a moment. I have some news to share with you. Yesterday ah, Sister Mary from our mother house informed me that our beloved order is in serious financial difficulty, so serious that some order houses are being closed and sold. Religious sisterhoods are not exempt, it seems, from worldly illnesses like inflation and recession. Nothing definite has been decided yet, but there's a strong possibility that our convent will be put up for sale. -What? -For sale? -What would happen to us, Mother? -It's likely that we would be transferred to other convent houses. -Oh, no. -Where? -Mother, what are we going to do? -Whatever we are asked to do. What we cannot change, we will accept. But what we can change, we must. That gets down to pottery, the one thing that brings us an income. If we can increase that income so we become self supporting, I believe we can keep this convent. We will add to our production, reduce our costs, anything and everything in our power. -I've got four new molds that we can put into production. That should give us at least half a dozen new pieces per day. -Good. -We can cut down on breakage. -All right. All right. A good start. And why don't we assign Dixie to clean up detail. That will allow everyone more bench time. -Clean up? -Fine. I'll get her started this afternoon. -Good. And I will be looking for other things you can do. See you at rosaries. -All right. Let's get moving. Dixie. -M-hm. -Would you bring over some of us cartons, the ones addressed to Moss Industries. Sister Theresa-- -Steven Moss? -Right. Three or four should do it. would you give me a hand-- -You sell to him? -They distribute the line. Would you give me a hand with the new mold? -Sure. -Good. -All right, you guys. We're stopping in an hour. -All right, Tony. -We're with you, baby. -Hi. Here comes Tony. -You all know why I'm down here, right? -Yeah. -I'm going to have one last meeting. You know why I'm here, right? -(TOGETHER) Yeah. -It's me, the famous me. All right? -Yeah. -If this don't work out, we strike. You guys ready to strike? -[COUGHING] Ah! Mother. Ah, mother. Do you have a minute? -Of course, Dixie. -I-- I was thinking about what you said yesterday, you know about the financial problems you've been having here. -Yes. -Well, I've come up with an idea that I think will help increase production. -Oh, that would be welcomed. -I'm convinced you could do a lot better if your operation were run efficiently, and I could organize that in no time, you know, make up work schedules, assign quotas, put the right nun on the right task. I mean, all those things that streamline a business. -Hm. And this is something you want to do in addition to your cleanup duty. -Well, you see, I think this efficiency thing is every bit as important. -Or do you see someone else assigned to your cleanup duty? -Well, it doesn't matter. I just wanted to help, and I-- I thought I could do something I'm better suited to do. -Let me see if I've got this right. You're proposing a reorganization of our production methods. Ah, one result might be the higher productivity, more pots per nun as it were. Yes? -Right. -And ah, you would assume an administrative position going from labor to management, so to speak. Dixie, the organizer. -Dixie the organizer. Hm. Interesting suggestion. -Good. -Then again one might interpret it as self-serving. -Look, Mother, I'm not looking for a cushier job. I'm just trying to help you out of a bind. Now, if you're not interested, well, you're the madame here. -I appreciate that, Dixie, and I'm going to take your suggestion under advice. -Well, that's great. -In the meantime, let's keep things as they are. -All right. Like I said I'm just trying to help. -And you will. Thank you. -Dogmatism in the age of renewal. Methinks the Titan is better matched. -Agnes dear. -Now, don't be too rigid, Eugenio. She might be able to teach us all a trick or too. -I thought you were asleep [INAUDIBLE]. -Now don't sell me short, Eugenio. -That will be the day. -More coffee, Sister Agnes? -Thank you. -You do that very nicely. -Well, I like things pretty and really nice. -Tell us about your world, Dixie. We'd all like to hear what it's like. -Well, seems to me it's not so different as it is here. Now, we're both a bunch of girls tending to the comfort of mankind just that you tend to the spirit and we tend to the body. -Disgusting comparison. -Why is it disgusting? -Because we do God's work. We try to illuminate man. You cater to his basic instincts. -Well, that's right, Sister Margaret. That's what we both are, caterers. -You profit from it. -I'm in business. -I have expenses. I'm responsible for maintenance, rent, medical checkups, same as here. -Mother, how can you let her compare herself to us? -Well, we're not in business, of course. Our purpose is not to make money. -It's getting to be. -Yes. But maintenance, medical expenses, mortgage payments, that sounds pretty familiar. -Do you take confession too. -Well, I do in a way, Sister Margaret. -Excuse me, everybody. Esmeralda is about to give birth. -Who's Esmeralda? -Esmeralda is our foal. It's in labor. -Come on down, Dixie. This is something you should see. -Somebody lend her a sweater. It's going to be dirty down there. -She can have mine. -Come on, Dixie. -I'll be down in a minute. I'm just going to get my purse. -Sometimes with long-legged animals, they'll get a hoof stuck in the birth canal. So you have to be ready to go in and assist. -With your hand? -You know we're here to help you sweetheart. -They don't mind. -Why does anybody become a nun? -I just decided I wanted to spend my life serving God and getting to know him in a personal way. -My sixth grade ceramics teacher had a big influence on me. Most loving person I'd ever experienced. I knew right then that I wanted to be surrounded by that kind of human being. -But what about the vows? What about the chastity thing, don't you ever think about that? -Of course. -We're not dead, Dixie. -We all have an occasional spring evening, and when you get right down to it, it's not easy. We talk about it together. That helps. And then you have to remember why you took the vow in the first place. -I don't think I could ever fit in with this life. -Join the club. -Most of us have felt that way from time to time. -I don't believe it. -It's true. -Absolutely. I've gone through periods when I've doubted, even questioned the existence of God. -I know I would never have made it without the other Sisters. -You really love it here, don't you? -This is my home, and my family. And we've all taken the same risks. That helps. -What's the risk? -Giving up control over your life. -And the kicker is, you never know you're a success at it until after you die. -Easy, Esmeralda. Easy. -Is it time? -This feels like the hoof. You want to give me a hand? I may have to go in. -Well, what do I do? -Oh, just keep her calm. Make sure she doesn't kick. You'll know. -Easy, Esmeralda. That's fine. Stay calm. Good girl. Yes. You're doing fine. You look real pretty. Take it easy. Calm. [CALF CRYING] Oh, my. Oh, that's wonderful. That's wonderful. Oh. -Oh. -It's a boy. -Oh, wonderful. -And Dixie was a pretty spectacular midwife. -Congratulations. -Oh. -I think I'll go clean up. You coming, Dixie? -Ah, not just yet. Thank you. -I learned so much from watching these creatures, how present they are at the moment. Never question past or future, just absorbed in the nowness of life. I never did ask you, Dixie, do you have children? -No, Mother. Doesn't exactly go with my line of work. -Ah. Another similarity it seems. -Oh, my goodness. I have never. -Dixie, You've really got it down to a system. -It's miraculous. -How about a little show of appreciation to our Cleaning Lady Supreme. [APPLAUSE] Come on, Margaret. Fair is fair. [APPLAUSE] -Oh, gee. Thank you. No. -Is that a G sharp and an F sharp there? I'm going to play two B's. -Sister, play that string again. Doesn't that sound like that piece you did, the last month in mass? -Oh, sing it, Sister Theresa. -(SINGING) When you're weary feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all. I'm on your side when times get rough. Then friends just can't be found like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down, like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down. When you're down and out, when you're on the street, when evening falls so hard, I will comfort you. I'll take your heart oh, when darkness comes. And pain is all around, like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down. Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down. [APPLAUSE] -Thank you, sister. -Oh, that was great. That was just wonderful, darling. -Oh, from another life. -And what a life. Sister Theresa used to be an acid rock flower child before she joined us. -You? I can't believe it. -You see, Dixie, It can happen to anyone, -Oh, don't bet your teeth on that, Sister Honey. -It's all right, Agnes. We'll get help. All right. Get her oxygen. All right. All right. Don't try to speak. Take it easy. We're getting help, Agnes. It's coming. -She is very heavily congested. So I'm going to start her on some antibiotics and a bronchodilator. -All right. Will she be all right? -I think so. The real danger with emphysema patients, particularly with someone her age, is pneumonia. So she's going to have to be watch very carefully at least 48 hours and admitted to the hospital. -Absolutely necessary? -I would say absolutely. Yes. -Eugenio. -Yes. -Eugenio, If I'm going to die, I want to be here. -You're not going to die, Agnes. The doctor knows exactly what to do. -I'm frightened, Eugenio. Don't let them take me to the hospital. -Agnes, don't be frightened. -Please. Eugenio. This is my home. If ah-- if anything is going to happen, I want to be here with the Sisters. -All right, Agnes. This is where you'll stay. With us. -No hospital? -No hospital. I promise. -Thank you. -Rest now, dear. -Thank you. -She'll tell us exactly what she needs. We'll look after her. I don't want her moved. -That's not the best thing for the patient. She needs round-the-clock care. -I know. We'll take good care of her. She's scared. -All right. I'll give you the medication schedule. -Thank you. -And you call me at the first sign of any problem. -Of course. -That's also for rest if she needs it. Now, tomorrow is my fill-in's day, but I'll leave numbers at my exchange where you can reach me. Good night, Sister. -Thank you. I'll be moving my things into Agnes' room. -I'll get it ready for you anyway. -Dixie, would you stay with Agnes while I show the doctor to the door? -Of course. -Thank you. For everything. -Dear, Eugenio. What would I do without you? -Good night, Doctor. Let her live a little longer. Who's there? Come out, please. This instant. What on Earth are you doing here, child? -Did you get all these boxes? Little box here. You're doing a wonderful job. Sister Theresa, you have all the packing you need? Good morning, Sister JB. More straw. -Everyone, we're Sisters, and I always feel a little odd about asking you to listen while I speak. But sometimes there are matters that concern us all, and ah, it becomes necessary. This is one of those times. As you know, several weeks ago, we accepted Dixie into our home in the hope that she would benefit from the experience. In my mind she became one of us, assuming her responsibilities and making a significant contribution to our work. Ah, I think you'll all agree that the condition of the pottery shed is better than it's ever been. -Without a doubt. -I even wrote Judge Delaney a letter to that effect several days ago. But I have discovered something, a deception that saddens me greatly. Dixie has been paying an itinerant farm girl to perform her cleanup chores from the third day she was here. -I don't believe it. -That's disgraceful. -Dixie? Would you like to respond? -Is it true? -Well, yes but not-- -Did you hire someone to do you work or not? -Well yes, but-- -All right. That's that. -Margaret, give her a chance. -She's already had her chance as far as I'm concerned. -At least give Dixie a chance to speak. This isn't the Inquisition. -I would like to hear what Dixie has to say. -Absolutely. -Please. -Sisters. -Dixie. -Well. Well, maybe I didn't play it by the rules, but I don't believe I did anything wrong. The work got done, and it got done well. So what's the harm? That's the basic principle of capitalism, maximize your output by doing what you do best. Well, I'm an organizer. I'm not a manual laborer. I know how to scrub floors. I've scrubbed floors dirtier than this. Well, that farm girl is used to that work, and she needed the money, and she can do a better job than I can. Well, when-- when I got here, I didn't know what to expect. It was like landing on Saturn. I know you now. I-- I know some of you real well. Put me to work, but use my experience, use my talents. That way I can contribute, and maybe I can even help you out of this bind you're in. -She doesn't belong in this house and never has. She's shameless, arrogant. -Sister Margaret -It's true. She doesn't know right from wrong. It's senseless for us to subject ourselves to this any longer particularly when our own survival is so uncertain. We're not qualified to rehabilitate Dixie, or anyone else. Maybe prison is the best place. At least they know how to deal with-- -I don't believe what I'm hearing. Granted Dixie was wrong, but where's our compassion, our forgiveness? We are qualified for that, you know. -Would anyone else care to speak? Sister John the Baptist, you've been very silent. -Well, I think I've been as close to Dixie as anyone here, and it wasn't difficult. She's a very appealing person. What makes me sad is, I think Dixie does know. I think she knows what trust is and what's right and wrong. Dixie, you didn't do what was right. You did what was best for you. -Sister John? -It seems to me we're all partly right. Dixie knows what she's doing, but she is in our custody and care. I think I have an appropriate solution. Dixie, you will be allowed to remain here. However, for the rest of your stay, you will be denied the privilege of work. You will cease to participate in the activities of this house. Your duties will be assumed by the Sisters. -Mother Eugenio, that's not fair. Punish me if you want to, but don't make the others suffer. -We're a community, Dixie, and when one of us puts selfish interests above those of the group, everyone suffers for it. -Well, I think that stinks. You talk about community and you hurt the others to prove a point. -That will be all, Dixie. Go to your room. -I'm right. You know I'm right. I could help you out of this bind, but you're too stubborn to admit it. -That's enough. You are dismissed. Now. -Potatoes? -Dixie? -M-hm? -Saint Francis wrote this prayer. I'd like you to memorize it. You can recite it for me tomorrow. -The whole thing? -The whole thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I need another box here. -Here's one. Here's one. -The whole bottom layer. -Sister, more straw, please. -We'll go shelf by shelf. -Ah. How's it going? -Well, we're getting there. -Coming through. -Sorry. I was thinking, maybe I could have my next lesson soon. -It's really not the best time, Dixie. -Why don't you tell her the truth? She lied, she cheated, and nobody wants-- -I wasn't talking to you, Margaret. So what do you say? -I really can't think about your lessons now, Dixie. We're short handed at the moment. -I get the picture. -Look at that. Isn't it beautiful? -All right. Stand back, everybody. And wish us luck. [APPLAUSE] [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Come in. -All right, Mother. You win. You're the boss. You hold all the cards. You made my life miserable. Now how long is this going to go on? -Probably until you leave, Dixie. -That's not fair. This punishment is barbaric. I might as well be in prison, for God sakes. Now, what the hell do you want from me? -I asked you to memorize a prayer. -I know that. I'm not talking about that. -If you know it, say it. -Lord make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred-- -All right. This is a prayer, Dixie, not a tirade. -I can't help it. -Yes, you can. You're angry at me, not God. Just talk to him. You can pretend I'm not even here. Once again, please. -Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me so love. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness, joy. -Good. -That's a nice prayer. -Yes. An old favorite of mine. The first thing Sister Agnes maybe memorize during my postulate days. -You had to do this? -More than once, I'm afraid. -Why? -In Sister Agnes' eyes, I was somewhat rebellious, not unlike you, I would think. I wanted things my way. Why don't we continue together this time. -(TOGETHER) Oh, divine master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive. It is in pardon that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born to internal light. Amen. -All right, you guys. You're ready? -Yeah. -We're ready. -Right now. -Yeah. -You guys ready to strike? -You bet we are. -All right. -It seems to me you're on my property, Marchesso. When you go, take this thought along with you. You can intimidate other people with your strike tactics, but not Steven Moss. -Listen, Steven Moss, Mr. Kilpatrick, Mr. Stanley, myself are here to negotiate a contract. -Admit it Marchesso, five minutes, Marchesso. Five minutes for you and your goons over there to get off my property, and if you don't, not one of them ever delivers here again. -Go to hell, Moss. If my men don't deliver here, nobody delivers here. You want a war? I'll give you one. -Fine. Then war it is. Just keep on taking it until you think it will come back. -Ah, ha, ha. We'll see some [INAUDIBLE]. Harry, get down off that thing, and leave it right where it is. -OK, chief. -Don't you move, Harry. -All right. We're gonna strike. Let's go. Come on. -[CROWD CHANTING] Union! Union! Union! -Roll up your window. -Oh, please. Our pottery. -Sister, what are they doing? Please. -Oh, my Lord. -They ruined everything, Mother. -Who? -That's the transportation workers. They just started breaking everything. -Lord help us. -Thank God you're both all right. Come inside now. -What are we going to do, Mother? -I don't know yet. We'll think of something. Theresa, hardly touched your food. -I'm just not very hungry, Mother. -You sure? [CRYING] -Mother Eugenio, can I say something? -Yes, Dixie. -This punishment, being on the outside, it's ah, it's really hard. I understand now how important it was to be part of all this especially when so much-- -I can't listen to this. I'm not interested in her pain. -Margaret, it's all right. -She's doing it again. -She's just trying to help. -Always the same. You. You. You. -I didn't mean it that way, Sister Margaret. Really. -It's just a painful time for all of us, Dixie. -I know that. -I'm very sorry, Mother. I'm very upset. -Margaret, sit down. -It-- it's just that I-- I want to be a part of your lives again, any way I can. In any way you say. -Thank you, Dixie. That's really nice. -Yes, it is. -I'm glad you shared those thoughts with us, Dixie, but this punishment was not given lightly. And it cannot be lightly withdrawn. -I understand. I was just hoping. -At the proper time. -Thank you, Mother. -Yeah. I'll accept the charges. DIXIE (ON PHONE): Hi, Tony baby. -Dixie, sweetheart. What a nice surprise. -I'm sorry I called collect, but I had to talk to you, Tony. -You can call me any time. That's what friends are for. What's the problem. -It's the nuns, Tony. They're in a jam. Now, you've got to let them deliver the pottery, otherwise, they're finished, and they'll lose everything. -Dixie, my hands are tied. You know I wouldn't hurt a nun, but we're fighting for our lives. It's a battlefield out there, honey. These things happen. -One little exception, Tony. Just for the nuns. -Any concession is a sign of weakness. We can't bend, we can't break, we can't make no exceptions. -I'm begging you, Tony. Please. -Dixie, I love you, but there's nothing I can do. -You are certifiable, you know that? You're asking me to break the law, to violate the orders of the Mother Superior, and to assist in an escape. -I know it's a lot to ask Sister John. But I need your help. Just drive me into town, give me a hour hour. He can't turn me down in person. I'll assume full responsibility for the consequences. I don't even care if I go to jail. Well you're going into town on the laundry run anyhow tonight. Give me a chance. -Why? Give me one good reason? -For old time's sake. Because you know I wouldn't stick my neck out unless I were damn sure I could pull it off. Plus I owe you something. I want to clear the books. How do I look? -Weird. -Good. Wish me luck. -Good luck. -Maybe you'd better say a prayer. -Are you kidding? I'm on my ninth Hail Mary. -Hi, Tony. -Hey, Dixie. Am I dreaming? First the phone, now you're here. How'd you get out? -I got a two-hour pass. Listen, Tony. Ah, I need to talk to you in private if you could spare the time. -What are you talking if I could spare the time. You need private, you got it. Come on. Hey. Hey. You know Kilpatrick. Tad, you've met 100 times. Pegs is a lawyer. Very quiet. So you. -OK. -You want some wine? -No. -So tell me what's the crisis, you want to stay in the convent? -It's the nuns, Tony. I've got a new idea. -Dixie. Dixie. You're going to start with that again? -Well, what if I arranged a meeting tonight. You and Moss sit down and discuss the situation and start to work something out. -You don't know what you're talking about. It don't work that way. -Well, why does it work that way? You've going to have to have a meeting sooner or later. You can't strike forever. -Sometime, yeah. But not now, and not with that louse. This is the time to show strength and not to blink. -While your not blinking, the nuns are going down the tubes. -Dixie, I'm not going to budge. They'll be no meetings, no exceptions. Period, huh? So forget it. -All right, Tony. I gave it my best shot. I've earned that time anyway. You take care of yourself, you hear? -Yeah. -I worry about you. -About me? -Well, you're getting so much public attention lately. I just stopped dead in my thoughts-- oh, no. -Oh, no what? -Didn't you know? Steven Moss has been seeing a lot of Sherry lately. -So? And? -Sherry has pictures. -What pictures? -You know? The ones of you in the baby doll nighty? -What? You let her have those? -Well, what did you want me to do? I couldn't take them with me to the convent. -Holy mother. He could ruin me. You've got to get them back. Now. Tonight. -Calm yourself, Tony. I wish I could help you, but I only have two hours. -Dixie, you don't understand what this means. Please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you as a friend. -I'm sorry to interrupt like this, but Dixie, it's a quarter to 9:00. -Oh. Thank you, Sister John. I'll be right out. -I'll be in the truck. -Thank you, Sister John. Well, Tony. I gotta get back to the convent. -Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What about the pictures? -What pictures. -The pictures. -What pictures? -Pictures. -Oh. Those pictures. Well, if I do get them back, Tony, you're gonna have to meet with Moss tonight. -No way. -It's only fair. -What's fair? -I do a favor for you, you do a favor in return for me. What's the big deal? -Because even if I agree to this cockamamie meeting, there's no way Moss would. The city is giving him a testimonial dinner tonight, Man of the Year? You think that creep is gong to walk away from that? -Don't worry about Moss. He'll be there. He owes me, and I'm collecting my debt tonight. -You're holding him up too? Wonderful. I don't believe this is happening. -Tony. Tony, everything is going to be fine. We have an opportunity to help each other. Isn't that what friends are for? -I am the Mother Superior, Agnes, but the blame is mine. -Look at the state we're in, no income, no inventory. spirits are down. We're likely to lose our home. -Oh, don't say that, Eugenio. -It's my fault. I made the decision. -You can't blame yourself for the state of the economy. -No, but if I kept abreast of the order's difficulties, I might have foreseen some of these problems. -Well, maybe we do need to television set. -There's another thing. My decision to bring Dixie into this house. What did that do you beside add to our problems and create friction. Maybe I should send her away. I'd be admitting defeat. At least I' be relieving some of the burden. -Quite right, dear. -You agree? -If you think it will help. -The truth is, Agnes, I won't. -Eugenio, you're a wondering Mother Superior, but you can't do it alone. Go to the Sisters. Ask for their help. They are your strength. Utilize this community and you'll have a formidable force. -I'm doing it again, aren't I? Trying to steer alone, even with Dixie. -I thought we got rid of her. -Tonight for the first time she-- she desired to help, wanted to be part of us again, but I-- I wasn't ready to listen. We could use her spirit and drive now. Ironic, isn't it? -I always like what the Spanish nuns say., God writes straight in crooked lines. -Dixie. It's Mother Eugenio. -Thank goodness. I was getting frantic. -Ah, wait. Things have gotten complicated. I need more time. -What are you talking about? -Well, you're going to have to leave without me. -What? -Well, I can't quit now, not when I'm this close. -Dixie, you promised me, two hours. You said. -I know, and I meant it, but this is something I have to do. I mean, I can't go back until I give it everything I have. I can't. -Oh Dixie, you're the most infuriating, stubborn person I know. -No hard feelings. Oh, I brought you some bread sticks. I'll take care of this. Dixie. -Go home, Sister John. -I couldn't find her anywhere. -Oh, Dixie. -Do we have to report her, Mother? -We have no other choice really. -Couldn't we just give her the benefit of the doubt? -I have to inform the authorities. And I'm going to do just that. -Yes, Mother. -First thing in the morning. -Yes, Mother. -Yes. New Orleans. New Orleans Police Department, please. -We'd like to start things rolling while you're finishing your dinner. There is a lot to be said about our man of the year, and there are a couple of speakers up here who are dying to say it. -Dixie, that was Hagar, the cop that busted us. -Well, keep your head down and look holy. -It's no accident that tourism is increasing, no accident that the railroads and the buses are bringing more people to us. Our convention center is booked into the year 2004. These are the results of the hard work of this organization. -Dock 48, Hagar? -Any sign of her? -Ah, no. Nothing. -Ah, what now? -I don't know. I figured if she wasn't at Rita's, she had to be at Sherry's. -Got any ideas? -None. -Nun. That's it. Of course. Call Bell Cabs. They picked up three nuns, 2020 Basin Street about 10 minutes ago. Find out where they went. -Excuse me, my son. We're Sisters from the Convent of the Holy Grace, and we'd like to see Mr. Moss. -I see. Um, I'm Harry Meadows. I'm Mr. Moss' public relations representative. Is he expecting you, Sister? -No. But we're old friends. Well just tell him the Mother Superior is here. I'm sure he'll be delighted to see us. -All right. All right, Mother. I'll be right back. -Oh, keep your veils down girls. There are a lot of our customers out there. -Where's Dixie? -I left her in New Orleans, Mother? -Why? Why in the world did you taker her there? -Nuns? I don't know any nuns, do I? -It doesn't matter. We grab a few pictures. That kind of stuff is gold. -I guess a little spiritual publicity can't hurt. -Hi, again, Mother. Why don't we first get a few pictures of you with Mr. Moss. -Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Meadows, but we can't allow our faces to be photographed. -Oh. Of course. No problem. I'll just photograph you from the back. All right. Here we are. Steven, you remember Mother-- -Dixie, son. -Right. Dixie. -Well, for goodness' sake. How nice to see you, Mother. -Steven, my son. -What do you want? -Well, I would have been here sooner, but it was so difficult. I'm sure nobody understands better than you that crooked little corners we get shoved in sometimes. -The corners we've been in, my son Remember? Hm? -If this is your idea of a joke, Dixie, it stinks. -It's no joke, Steven. I'm here on a very important mission for the Sisters of the Convent of the Holy Grace. -I don't know any convent. I'm being honored, damn it. -Big smile, Steve. -They are about to lose their home because of your problems with Marchesso. So I have arranged a meeting between the two of you tonight. -Are you out of your mind? -All right, Steve, that's fine, but more smile this time. -Perhaps I should allow myself to be photographed frontally with Mr. Moss. -Yeah. Frontally. -Well, why don't we all. -Stop that. -Hey. Hey. Lighten up. You're [INAUDIBLE]. -Shut up, Harry. Use your head. I can't walk out on my own banquet. After the judge, I go on. I'd like to add to the list of Steven Moss' accomplishments by testifying that he was one of my most loyal customers, and by his own reckoning brought me enough business to open five new houses. Let's here it for everybody's man of the year, Steven Moss. -All right. -Yeah. STEVEN (ON PHONE): Marchesso, this is Steven Moss. Let's make up right now at Dixie's house. -It's not that simple. -Sure, it's simple. All you gotta do is sign a union contract. -That's not a contract, it's communism. -Now don't start arguing. This is our city. We have a stake in it. I mean, that's the beauty of living in the community. It makes us each a dependent. You know as well as I do that if one individual puts selfish motives above the interests of the others, every member of the community suffers for it. Now you both know right from wrong, so let's stop quibbling. All you have to do is announce to the papers that you've agreed to sit down and start talking tomorrow. And then in the-- in the interest of fairness, you're going to make an exception for the nuns. Well, you can call it a test case. You can call it anything you like, but by the time the papers hit the streets tomorrow, you'll both be heroes. Well, what do you say? -All right. I'll agree. But I've got to get out of here right now. -Terrific. Tony? -Why I-- -But I have the photographic display you were interested in. -Count me in. -Hallelujah. Hallelujah -Move aside, Marchesso. I'm late. -To Mother Eugenio, to Sister John, to Sister Theresa, to Sister Agnes. Ah, what the hell, Sister Margaret. -And Sister Dixie. -In the last few hours, I've spoken to a number of your acquaintances. -Yeah? -Oh, yeah. They're a mixed lot, Steve Moss, Mother Eugenio, Tony Marchesso, and a young lady named Sherry Bouvais. The only thing they all have in common is you. -Well I'm certainly common all right. -Quite uncommon. You have added two misdemeanors and a felony to your achievements tonight. And I further charge you with-- with passionate friendship to the Sisters with whom you've been living. an imaginative use of your resources in their behalf. You'll be going back to there tomorrow, Ms. Cabot to finish out the 90 days. Now, that's possibly not the best I can do for you, but it is the very best that I can do for the Sisters. -Ah, I'll get out here. -Well, Ms. Dixie, jump on the back. -Think it will hold me? This plunker looks like it's ready for the junk pile. -Excuse me, Mother. -Quite a little spread you got here, Mother. -We're learning how to organize it. Put the right Sister on the right task. Assign quotes. -Pretty radical stuff for a bunch who don't own a television set. -Not doesn't, did. SISTER THERESA (SINGING): When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all. I'm on your side when times get rough. And friends just can't be found like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down. Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down.
