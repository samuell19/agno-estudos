Credits Subtitles originally from Yoruq/wasted_life Ported to .srt by ekwj Ah.. Traffic jam Miss, we will be stuck here for awhile Excuse me, let me get off here 7 pm at Shinjuku, I'll be waiting -Nana How many people are there who knows of Nana Nana, Do you remember how we met? It's the room on the 7th floor There is no elevator I like it I like it here What do you think? Do you like it? There aren't many apartments like this You are very lucky Nana.. Why can't dreams and reality bring happiness to our lives? I still do not know.. We were always together but I still do not understand you I didn't even notice when you were in pain Nana, please forgive me.. Hachi, what's that? It's 'donzoku' You don't know about 'donzoku'? Write down your wishes and hang it by the leaves Give me a pen Here I want blue I want pink 'defeat Trapnest' Defeat Trapnest Nobu, that's not a wish. It's your determination oh, right.. 'I wish Nana will get a mobile phone' You should really get an air conditioner I wish to find happiness.. Like getting a boyfriend Give up on Takumi. He's a player. Ah! Takumi's autograph! Last time when he came over, I forgot to ask for one. Is that all you want? I'll ask Ren to get you one. Really? Promise? I won't forget Yasu, why don't you write one? I'll pass.. my mind is filled with what we need to do for our next live It's been arranged. Our last live was well received by the audience. We are invited to perform again. Wow! You guys are definitely performing! You must! Right? Nana? Defeat Trapnest I feel empowered! Right? Feel the hotness! right, you are absolutely right I got it! What are you doing? You're making a mess! On that night, Tokyo sky was covered by dark clouds We couldn't see the stars But, we still had fun Even though I know that simply wishing for something to happen will not make things happen But at the time, we were hoping that we will be happy when our wishes come true. 'I wish Hachi will find a boyfriend with long hair.' - Nana Uh.. I drank too much A cold? It seems serious, you should take a day off In other words, there's no need for you to come back here ever again He... just fired me That's right! You are under estimating society How can it be? I hope you learned your lesson G-o-o-d-b-y-e-! just one would be enough just like Nana having a goal and blindly chasing after it I want something like that too - Unknown number - Hello? Hello! Nana? It's me, Takumi. Sorry that I couldn't stay last time I want to thank you properly, so I asked Ren for your number. Don't say that, I wasn't being a good host as well. What are you doing in a place like this? What? In a place like this? Behind you, do you see a big black Benz? Over there! I see it! Come over, let's have dinner together. Sure! At the time, I felt so empty The world around Nana, everyone shines so brightly That's not something that anyone can achieve I also want to be a part of their world There's no need to be nervous Yes. Sorry. But I don't know what to do I never imagined to meet you like this I should be the one saying that. I thought it'd be great if we meet again .. how can that be? I wouldn't have called you otherwise Give up on Takumi. He's a player. What's this? It's huge.. like a castle! Don't tell me it's a suite room? Gorgeous Order whatever you like Ah! I always wanted to get room service! Awesome! Delicious! I like Nana's cooking more. You're right. It's tiresome to eat out all the time during tour. After the tour ends, I'll go see you right away! Please cook for me then. It's alright. I know what to expect. I only want to be like this for now. I won't take it seriously. - Yasu - Hello? Hey.. Hachiko! It's late. Where the heck are you? Nana! You are getting me worried! I'm sorry. I'll be staying over in my friend's place tonight. What? at your boyfriend's? No! At Junko's! Haha! I'm kidding! Don't take it so seriously. Say hi to Junko for me. Sure I can't tell Nana, I don't want her to know Nana, actually I'm not fine at all but I can't just run away like this and I don't expect him to say he loves me It's no good. I might end up hurting myself again. - Takumi's phone number and e-mail - Trapnest's final tour is in Tokyo I can't go without a ticket, so I have to wait for him with my home cooked meal. with a shred of hope, I'll wait for him Looks delicious! So much food! Who's coming It's enough for 5 people They must be really hungry after the live. What time will Ren be here? What? Is he coming? You mean he's not? I don't think so. He never told me. He will definitely come, after the live is over. Wouldn't he come to see you right afterwards? There's that party after the live. I don't think he's coming. Really? Cheer up! I'll ask him to come over next time. Shall I ask him to bring Takumi with him? No, it's okay. Don't worry about it. Alright! I'll eat as much as I can! Too bad for Ren! Serves him right for missing all this delicious food! Nana This time's world tour.. Is really great! Thank you everyone! Cheers! Picture time! Stand closer! Cheese Alright! One more! Gin tonic. Nobu, you are drinking too much. I shouldn't attend another band's celebration This time, Takumi produced Trapnest's new album right? Yeah No wonder it's so much better than the first. You are cute. But all the music are composed by Ren Heard that? Give me one Who should I write it to? Hachiko Hachi? You met her at the Mahjong match. Her name is Komatsu Nana. Ah.. Nana. I don't think she needs one. No.. she's always wanted one. I've already done it with her. Here. Wait.. what did you do? She's Nana's close friend Have some decency. I didn't force her. She willingly came to me. Wait a minute! If you want a fight, let's take this outside. Don't ruin the party for the tour staff. Nobu. I'm going home. Mr. Takumi, thanks for the hard work. Don't get mad. It's all your fault. Thanks to him, I remembered something important that I had to do. I'm gonna go. .. but Takumi, there's still.. Count me out. Hey, Hachiko. Have some? Get her back! Doesn't Nobu like Hachi? I can't help it. Hachi likes Takumi. Takumi just happened to be there for Hachi Hachi is not that type of woman. Takumi must have fooled her with his sweet words. You think so? Hachi is not that stupid - It's not stupid. It's naive. Hachi must be lonely and sad after she broke up with her boyfriend Yet you are too perserved to do anything. I'm not going to forgive Takumi for what he did. Do you know what time it is? It's already 4 am. Did you have a fight with Nana? Do you have a boyfriend? No Really? That's good. You are cute. Men must have fallen all over for you. No that's you Mr Takumi. No need for formalities. Takumi must be very popular among women. I bet you've had lots of girlfriends Not true. I am very lonely. No way! How can that be? My work comes first. They all felt neglected. Sometimes I couldn't keep my promise. No woman can stand being with me for so long. You can't help it if you're busy. You are the only one who understands me. That's because I am a fan of Takumi and Trapnest. Please place your work before your relationship with a woman. You are so cute, really.. Stay with me forever. I am Hachi's friend. I want to cheer for her. But, why does it have to be Takumi? Why does Trapnest steal all the important people away from me? First, Ren. Now, Hachiko. Just go and have a talk with Ren. What are you trying to do? It's no use feeling this way. Quit smoking from now on. I will do the same. Please try our new product - 3 Flavoured Dumpling. In each pack, there are three different flavours. Shrimp, pork and vegetable. Please come and try it. Please have one. Scout? Scout? Yes. Scout? Right. Wait. Calm down, calm down, Nana. You are the one who should calm down. Right. Actually, we mailed our demo tape and live video to several recording companies. We were contacted by Gaia Records, one of the biggest recording company. Wow! That's great! How about your debut? Someone from Gaia will be coming to our next live event. If they like what they see, we will then discuss it in detail. That's definitely not a problem. BLAST's lives are the best. Isn't it? Consider the deal sealed then. Nana, Takumi came over after Trapnest's final live. Yeah I know. I saw you two. I called out to you but you didn't notice me. I'm sorry. About what? You must be surprised because I didn't tell you.. I was surprised. But, there's no need to apologize. But then I noticed that you left because you didn't want to disturb us. It's alright. I'm going to live with Ren soon. What? At Ren's place? It's only for 2 weeks. Trapnest is taking 2 weeks off from activities. It's rare for them to have a break. So, I want to spend some time with Ren. When I woke up the next day, Nana had already left. Isn't the scenery beautiful? Live with me. I'll think about it. Let's go on a trip. We've got the time. Maybe for you. I'm busy. Take a break. Forget about work. An important live is ahead of us. We are practicing everyday. You can see the ocean in Tokyo very well. I have forgotten. During the two weeks Nana was gone, I put all my energy into work. As for their practices, I never missed one. And never once has Takumi called me. Ah.. This time it's fireworks. Yes. It's close by, we should all go. Yes! Let's stop here, I am almost home. I'm sorry to trouble you for walking me home. What's wrong? I can't. About what? Uh.. nevermind. I'll tell you next time. What is it? I know that I am in no way better than him and that I am not good enough to surpass him.. What are you talking about? I may be able to offer you some suggestions. But, I will surpass him one day. Who? Takumi. Good night. Good evening we are BLAST. Think about it. You have talent. Your live was flawless. I've been in this business for so many years. I haven't been this excited in a long time. Yea, it's Nana. Ah.. Nana you've worked hard for this live. I'm already home. When will you be coming home? Sorry, we won't be able to go home. We are having dinner with someone from Gaia. Could it be that you've already prepared everything? No.. not yet.. I just got home. I'm really sorry. It's alright. Don't worry. Just go to your dinner. Compared to our promise, it's understandable that Nana chooses her work over me. It's also understandable that she chose to live with Ren over me. I understand everything. But.. does that mean I am not needed? I couldn't contact Takumi. Ocassionally, I sent him a few short messages. But, he never sends me any replies. Thank you for today. No, no, I should be saying that. Let's do this again some time. Hachi said she has to work tomorrow I want to go see her tonight. Welcome home! Sorry about yesterday. Nana asked us to come over to eat the food you prepared. It's really delicious. Good! When will you be able to debut? It's not that easy. We have to come up with some great songs that will do well in the charts first. Right now, I don't have much hope for you to write amazing songs. Well.. That's not true! He can do it! Actually, he already did. Nobu wrote a song on the night he came to Tokyo. That's the song I love the most. I'm serious. I fell in love with it when I heard it for the first time. I was so moved! It even gave me goose bumps! It would definitely do well in the charts. Uh.. Hachi.. That's enough.. Thank you. That's right.. we are out of drinks. Could someone go get some? Why don't you get it yourself? Uh.. sorry for not noticing. I'll go buy drinks. It's dangerous for a girl to go alone at night Nobu. Right! I love you. Telling you this now.. Maybe you'll just laugh at me. I know about your relationship with Takumi. You love him don't you? Where's Hachiko? She went out to get something. What? And I rushed home from work. They won't be home for some time. Why? I gave Nobu a chance for them to be alone. Good job Shin! I didn't want anyone to know about me and Takumi. So that I can pretend nothing had happened and live my life just like before. I am so calculating. You must have looked down on me. No. I am happy. I don't know how to neglect what I have felt for you. Nobu.. I.. I cannot force you to be with me. You will be confused if you get involved with me now. You are so kind and fragile. No matter how hard i try, I will never surpass Takumi. No.. I.. But, if you are willing to break up with him and be mine. I will do everything in my power to bring you happiness. Come and find me. I'll wait for you. I believe in you. I have something to tell you. Give me a call when you can. Sorry to bother you at work. - Nana Hello. Ah.. What is it that you wanted to tell me? What's wrong? What happened? Can I see you now? Sorry, I'm in the middle of my work. Sorry for bothering you at work. Can't you tell me over the phone? I have a busy schedule and I won't be available for some time. Is that so.. What should I do? What is it? Could it be that you're pregnant? What? No! No? Good! Don't scare me like that Believe it or not, I'm quite delicate. Sorry, I gotta go. I'll call you when I'm free. You don't need to. What? You don't need to. In other words, don't ever call me again. GOODBYE! I did it! I finally did it! Now it's over! Finally, I am awake! I'm here. I'm sorry to bother you at work. Nana told me that you worked here. When do you finish? 9pm? I see, I'll wait for you at the nearby coffee shop. Wait! You can't! Why? We've talked about this before. Only come when you've broken up with Takumi. I've already broken it off. It's too soon. But, I've already waited a day. A day seems like a year. Even so, a day is still a day. Right! Right. I'll wait for another day. Forget it! Do you know how to make 'Nikujaga'? It's my specialty Good morning. Nana? You're back! What about ren? I'm busy with work, so I had to return. How about you? Who were you with? Uh.. Right! Did you find Nobu's work place? Yes! Thank you. I had something to discuss with him. You two are very alike. He was always quite honest, naive and pure. So I think both of you would get along great. Nana To me, Nobu.. To me, Nobu.. I think I've fallen for him. Isn't it obvious? - Komatsu Nana - Phone refuses masked number. The following is an update on the typhoon. A strong typhoon No.11 has arrived at Kantou. It hasn't died down yet, but in about an hour.. It's Hachi. Hello. Nobu! What the heck are you doing? Get over here! Didn't you promise to pick Hachi up at 7pm? But, I can't get out! Look at the weather. I'm sure the fireworks is cancelled. Don't you want to see Hachi in a kimono? Your nose will bleed. I bought fireworks! Once the weather dies down, we'll go light them up by the lake. Why do you have to tag along? You two are soaked! It's raining cats and dogs. To our band, Hachi is like Madonna. When Hachi's laughter can be heard, there are bound to be noises from the crowd. No matter what, at our practices, she's always full of energy. Compared to a talented musician joining our band, her existence is alot more meaningful. What's that? You may have noticed. Your every move is like the wandering typhoon that deeply moves my heart. I am like a teenager who has just fallen in love for the first time. During that following week, I spent half the time staying at Ren's Hachi and I hardly see each other. We hardly had the chance to talk. But, I think it's good. Because we save alot of time from talking about unnecessary things. Open the package and put the curry in the pot. Once you remove a package, put a new pack on the table. One pack at a time. Are you listening? Your rice should look like this. Smells good! You smell it. What? Miss Komatsu? Miss Komatsu? You are pregnant. The small black circle is the egg containing your baby. Your baby is the black dot inside the egg. If you want to keep the baby come back for an examination in 2 weeks. If you decide not to keep the baby. You should take action soon, otherwise it would take a toll on your body. Do you need to take the picture home with you? Yes. We're done with practice I heard that you aren't feeling well. I'll go see you if you're not sleeping yet. Call me! - Nobu Nana? It's me. What? Nana, open the door. Please, open the door. Oh no, someone's coming. What are you doing here? Go home! This is no joke. Morning sickness? I won't be a burden. It's my fault for not being careful. Maybe it's my boyfriend's child. Go home. Don't ever come back. Is your boyfriend Nobu? Really? I understand. Takumi? What are you doing? - Nobu - Phone? Wait.. don't tell Nobu! Oh! Hachi? Yeah! Hello? Nobu, it's me. Takumi. Can you hear me? Yes. Nana is pregnant. I don't know who the father is. But, if Nana wants to keep it, I will accept it as my own. What do you think? Why don't you say something? Say something! What's wrong? Hello? Hachiko? Ah! Nana? It's good that you're there. Can you bring Nobu over? It's hard to discuss this over the phone. What the hell are you doing with hachi's phone? I'm just borrowing it. I'm at your place. What the hell are you doing there? Leave her alone! She's no longer yours! Hachi is now with Nobu. I know.. But, you are the one who stole my woman. Where is Hachi? She's here. Let me talk to her! I can't communicated with you. Nana wants to talk to you. Seems like she's not in the condition to talk. What the hell did you do? Anyways, we'll be there soon. Uh.. on your way home.. Could you get some grapefruits and carbonated drinks? What? I'm going to make her a drink. She's throwing up real bad and is in alot of pain. I'm counting on you. Throwing up? Don't be so depressed.. What if you lost your baby? Can you stand up? Nana is so undependable. Already an adult. Still doesn't eat proper meals. Spent time with men when you are lonely and then becomes pregnant. What am I going to do with you? You are going to make your parents cry. Though, I'm not in the position to lecture you. No matter who the father is, you are definitely the mother of the child. Hang in there. You came by yourself? Where's Nana? I don't know. Then, I'm gonna go. There's nothing good to talk about between the three of us anyway. Even if Nana doesn't make a choice, one of us is the father. Nana, is it true that you are pregnant? I want to hear it from you. The child could be mine. I also know that you broke off with Takumi not long ago. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You mean, you never broke up with him? Look at me! Why can't you face me? Please explain to me. I will believe you, even if you lie to me. Nobu said that Hachi is pregnant. I'm so confused. Am I weird? At a time like this, what should I do as a friend? I wanted to be Hachi's friend.. You smoke? Actually, I'm not as naive as Nana and Nobu think I am. Takumi is the only one who understands how empty and helpless I am. and he has forgiven me. I know that I have a baby inside me. No matter what I have to be strong. I cannot pretend as if nothing has happened. Starting today, I will be in the recording studio for a week. Before that, could I hear your answer? Otherwise, I won't be able to concentrate at work. I want to keep the baby. Having you as the father of my child. That is, if we are not a burden to you, I will marry you. What? So that you won't have to keep your pregnancy a secret. If we get married, no one will talk behind your back. The media won't bother you, since you are not in the industry. Any objections? Welcome back. I have something important to tell you. We are getting married. We'll be looking for a new place to move in. Sorry, but you need to find a new roommate. It's fine. I will be moving in with Ren soon. No, Wait. Please think about the trouble you might cause Ren by moving in. It would be disastrous if the media found out about your relationship with Ren. Before your debut, you wouldn't want to be known to the public this way, would you? Of course not! Sorry for making you worried. Then, be cautious. You don't need to apologize. I got it. I'll be careful. That's all I have to say. I'm gonna go. I'll get my staff to handle the rest of the details. If you find a place you like, go right ahead and put a hold on it. What? We'll be moving to a new place soon. So that you won't have to see Nana. You look alot better now. Has the vomitting subsided? Thank you. Don't. You don't have to worry about anything. Why not use the strawberry cups? Why buy them if you're not going to use them? Because it would be sad if the cups were to break. Great. They are beautifully connected together. They won't be sad anymore. Nobu, what happened to the new song? Ah.. It's rare to see you down. Get some comfort from Hachi. Where did you run away to? Such an important time for Hachi. You don't seem to care about her. I went back this morning. She didn't say a word to me. Takumi was the one who did all the talking. About what? It's okay, tell me. I won't be shocked by anything. Anymore. They are getting married. You were surprised! You would be! This is insane! I'm sorry Nobu. Don't be. Yesterday is already over. But, I am involved in this, why didn't I know anything? Am I not trustworthy enough for her? It's okay to cry, Nobu. You can cry on my shoulder! What are you doing? Don't be shy! Aren't we best buddies? But, there are so many people looking at us. So what? Before I met you, I hated everyone. But after knowing you, I realized that I can't give up on this world. I don't think you are untrustworthy, Nobu. You've only been dumped by a woman, don't be so down.. It hurts. Your wristband is cutting into my neck. Hello? Ren? Nana is at my place. She got drink after a few drinks. I can't seem to wake her up. Can you come and get her? I got it. I'll be there! Alright sorry. Oh.. she's awake! Where are you going? Ren is coming to get you! It would be problematic if the media finds him. Tell him that we shouldn't meet for awhile. What? Wait, Nana! Wait! To Nana, Hachi? Are you there, Hachiko? I don't think Nana will forgive me for what I've done. I will never forget the six months we spent together. I wish you would make your major debut soon and appear on television frequently so that I could hear you sing and see your glamour on stage. No matter who I am in love with, Nana is my only hero. Now and forever. - Komatsu Nana - Nana Why are you so upset? This is not a farewell letter. It's a sincere love letter. Go see her. Go to Hachi. You know you want to see her smiling face with joyful tears. Why should I go? That is what a hero would do. I'm looking for someone, she doesn't appear to be at home. Could you give this to her when she returns? Sure. Who is it? Komatsu Nana who lives with Ichinose Takumi. Buzzer for Room 302 is connected. Only expected visitors are allowed to enter. I'm sorry. There isn't anyone by that name living in this building. How's that possible? Trapnest's Takumi is living with that woman! Even if you pretend you don't know, I know she's here because we know each other. I'm sorry please take this back with you. Shin? Sorry, it's nothing really important. Ever since the fireworks, I've been wondering how you were doing. Fireworks are fun.. so was the summer when we wrote down our wishes on Kozoku. Yeah. We had fun. Let's do fireworks again! I wonder if the store still sells them. I'm sorry, Shin. I'm a traitor, I can't see you guys anymore. No matter what happens, you are still my friend. Nana, where is the blow dryer? I need to use it. I'm sorry, good night! I'll try again tomorrow after work. It's not like we'll never see each other again, There is a tomorrow. Why are you watching our tape first thing in the morning? We are on TV. What? Good morning! It's time for Morning Seven. Unexpectedly, we have received news on a popular figure. Guitarist of the popular band, Trapnest, Ren's exposed hot romance. His love interest was a former bandmate. Indies band Black Stones' vocalist Nana. Today, we will unveil the truth behind their relationship. Our guest for today is.. What is that? Oh no! What? Why are you making a fuss in the morning? What? Nana's gossip. Ah... Which means, Nana's the one who brought this up. That is to say, she's trying to make herself known to the public. That's a lie. It's obvious why she would do this. This would definitely increase her popularity. Yes. Yeah, I'm watching and I've told her to be careful. This is troublesome. Now the media is making a big fuss over it. What do you mean by troublesome? That's mean! Don't get involved. I'll take care of it. We are standing outside the apartment where Nana from the Black Stones resides. Nana is currently at home and she hasn't confronted the reporters yet. Yes. Who is it? Osaki Nana? We are here to find out about your relationship with Honjo Ren. Are you there? Mr Kawano. Have you seen what happened on TV? Yeah. We did. Why did this have to happen... Anyway, pack your bags. You're all going to have to stay in a hotel until the rumors die down. Miss Nana? Miss Nana? Please talk to us. We will report exactly what you say. Don't you dare go in. Shoo! Aren't you Black Stones... I won't let you get away with that. Are you alright? Why are you acting cool? Think about your position. It's alright. I can full-heartedly focus on the band now. Hachiko, just watch! I will make your wish come true. What is your relationship with Nana? Please tell us? I got it. Yes. Let's just go with the recording company's plan. It's so obvious that they are taking advantage of the situation to make more money. But don't be pressured by it. We won't sign the contract unless we agree to it. Are you kidding me? Of course we'll do it. It's time to set your pride aside. Things have already gone this far, we'll just use Ren's influence to get ahead, We must reach the top, no matter how we get there. Don't be affected by the scandals, just strive for our dream. I object! Even if we become famous musicians, It's all thanks to the scandals. I don't want to debut in a company that works this way. But, no matter how Gaia tries to increase our popularity There's no way to know how well we will sell. Since we are taking the chances, we need all the publicity we can get. There are certain things in life we need to accept. There are just way too many things in my life that I'm having trouble accepting Then you should understand it better than anyone else. In this world, justice doesn't always prevail. If you don't want to lose then you shouldn't start. If you can't accept this then go back to your home town. Takumi! Takumi's wife in UK. You know how to say this in Japanese. Ren hasn't said a thing so far. Soon he will be going through the gate. Which brings us to the end of this report. But, I want to hear what he has to say. Takumi? Yeah, it's me. I'll be going to UK tomorrow. I will send you a message with my contact info. Tomorrow? How long will you be there? Hmm.. six months That long? You can visit your family while I'm away. So that you can be taken care of. It would be good for the baby too. I don't want to. I want my own home. No matter what. You, me and the baby will live a happy life together. I understand. I'll bring home a present. What would you like? Diamond ring! Ah.. I haven't given you one. What's your finger size? Size 7! I got it. Hey Nobu, what's missing here? Ah.. sorry. I erased it. You should have told me earlier. May I have your attention Today's recording is cancelled. Instead, we had a meeting Next month, we will have concerts at 5 locations in Tokyo. Let's go! I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused. Why say it now? If you hadn't met me, you would have lived a peaceful life. It's alright. I'm destined to exist in the story of a woman named Nana. But, it's all over now. Now I feel I can write great heartfelt songs. Maybe the happiest moment of my life was that night with the full moon. But, I've already made my decisions. There were so many staff members involved in BLAST's debut project. We couldn't even remember all the names. The me who had trouble getting along with people, didn't feel any pain at all. Even if I met Hachi right now.. I can talk to her with a smile on my face. Even if she talks about Takumi or the baby, I can calmly listen to what she has to say. But, now there's no time for me to do that Shinjuku at 7 pm. I'll be waiting. - Nana Uh.. traffic jam. Miss, we would probably be stuck here for awhile. Excuse me, I'll get off here. We are ready, Mr. Kawano. Got it. We'll be there soon. Let's go! Sing your heart out! Good evening. We are BLAST. Hachi, although the distance between us is far. Where you are now, is the safest place in the VIP area. I wonder if the child in your tummy can hear our song. Life is.. to keep going forward even though you are being pulled backwards. Being pulled backwards doesn't make you stupid. As long as you keep going forward. At the time, everyone is discussing the two top selling bands. Even now no one has broken their selling records. Now you are in your 14th week of pregnancy. Your baby is doing very well. No matter what happens, I am Hachi's friend. What is it? It's from Shin. He forwarded Hachiko's mail to you. He wants you to read it. Tonight, at Tamagawa They are showing the firework display that was cancelled on the night of the typhoon. That summer day when we gathered together. I wish we could do it again, but I guess it's not possible. Because it's just a dream. Hachiko, it's not a dream. - Nana So pretty! What a big rock! Nobu gave up because he wants you to be happy.
