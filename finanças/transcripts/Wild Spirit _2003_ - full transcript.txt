[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [HAUNTING CHORAL, INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [FIREWORKS BURSTING] [CHEERING AND SHOUTING] Hey, you guys. Hey. Happy new year. No, not for another 15 minutes. Give me this. We're not going to let this go to waste. Mm-mm. [LAUGHTER] All right, guys. Here's to being together forever. Mm. Mm. This stuff is good. I didn't know what I was missing. Mm-mm. Makes me feel different. I like you just the way you are. Hey, want to get out of here? Yeah. Great. I'll take that. [LAUGHS] There we go. [LAUGHTER] We're meant to be together, you know? I know. Look how good we always fit. My dad says we can't even think about that stuff yet though. Oh, who's thinking? I'm feeling. I love you so much. We are going to be together. Yeah, and what happens when I move to Minnesota next week? Well, we'll talk on the phone, and I'll come visit. I'll hitchhike all the way if I have to. Yeah, like dad would really like that. Hey. I'm going to prove him wrong. I am really going to amount to something. I'm going to-- I'm going to play rock and roll music. You couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. No, no. I mean I'm going to play rock and roll music on the radio. And I'm going to be a great painter. I'm going to paint portraits of you, and I'm going to sell them and make a fortune. And then I'm going to send for you. You're dreaming. And I love it. Even though dad hates you, mom loves you. She even said, that man is something special. And I believe her. Really? Of course. I would never lie to you. [FIREWORKS BURSTING IN THE DISTANCE] [UPBEAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] Griffey, how come you don't use your real name? Lionel? Yeah. Sounds like a train. Griffin's OK. Griff's pretty cool though, kind of macho. I like Griffey. You know in those old movies, they used to drink champagne out of a lady's shoe. Uh. Let's do that. You're kidding. OK. What, me? You. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] JOE: Griff, Griff! We got to go. Our parents are here. Oh, shit. Your father's going to kill me. I got to go. Oh, Griffin, I didn't want you to go. I wanted you to make love to me. I know. Wanted you to be my first. I know, honey. I want that more than anything too, but I'll be back. I promise. Griffey? Wherever I go, wherever I am, I'll call you. [FIREWORKS BURSTING] You're listening to Dr. Lionel Griffin on "Rational Romance," here on the fourth day after Christmas. We have Bob from Centerville on the line. Go ahead, Bob. You're on the air. BOB: Love your show, man. Well, like, there was this girl I knew in high school, and I got an invite for my 20th year reunion. I'm kind of afraid. Yeah, you're afraid to see her again? Understandable. People change a lot in 20 years. Don't go, Bob. BOB: Huh? No, not huh. Don't go. She's probably gained 30 pounds and has kids hanging off of both boobs. BOB: Wow, that's pretty cold, man. Yeah, but that's life. Buy my book, "Rational Romance and Sensible Sex." Don't just read it in the bookstore. Next caller. WOMAN: I have long, flowing, blonde hair. Really? Are you hot? WOMAN: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, tell me what you look like. WOMAN: I have piercing blue eyes that see all. My lips are full and pouty. My breasts are big and round. I have a tiny, little waist, long legs, and a curvy, tight butt. Sounds hot. Is it true? WOMAN: Oh, yeah. [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] Laura, folks, I hate to do this, but we've got some business. Sorry, kids. Joe, if she calls again, you make sure you put her right through. As for us, we'll be right back after this. Joe, what the hell did you do to the air conditioning? There's a lot of static electricity going throughout the building, and it's messing with all the equipment. Yeah. Well, you know I don't like it any warmer than 72 and 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit, Joe. All right. Well, calm down. It'll cool down soon enough. In fact, it just did. I've been working on our wedding plans, dear. I've been with our lawyer all morning. And you know what? He tossed out that silly prenup. It's OK with you, isn't it? Well-- Those are for divorced people. You and I, we're going to be together for at least-- 30 seconds. [SIGHING] I totally trust Blake. I mean, I owe him so much. After all, he introduced us. You're such a doll. But you're on air, so I will see you exactly at 6:00 at your house. It's time for my massage. Mm. [CLEARS THROAT] And welcome back to "Rational Romance." This is Dr. Lionel Griffin. And we have an open line. Ah! [SPARKING] Whoops, we lost our caller and our lights. Sorry, folks. My friend Joe, the engineer, is adjusting the equipment. Joe, are we on the air? All right. Well, I guess so. It looks like we've got our caller back. WOMAN: Hello, Griffey. Is that you? Dr. Griffin, if you don't mind. You're on the air. WOMAN: I've been trying to reach you a long time. All right, great, a first time caller. What's your name? WOMAN: It's Marion. I was so surprised to hear your voice. I've been trying to find you for so long. You're a little faint. Are you on your cell phone? MARION: My dad wouldn't let me call you. We were in the car heading to Minnesota. The roads were icy, and there was a thunderstorm. All right. Get to the point, Marion. MARION: I heard you talk about forgetting the past. What about New Year's Eve? New Year's Eve, all right. That's a few days away. It's a great time for turning that page, putting your past behind. MARION: All the things we said. You were going to become an artist and do a portrait of me, play rock and roll on the radio. Who is this? MARION: Don't you remember drinking champagne from my shoe? Drinking champagne from your shoe? Marion? Marion? Marion. Well, what a pleasure. You know, friends, I've always told you that you have to put your past behind you. Look forward, never backward. MARION: Quickly, I don't think I have much time. This caller was an old friend who left me just 10 years ago. And I never looked back. Love is just a four-letter word, people. MARION: I've been trying to explain. Griffey, just let-- Oh, no, no. This is my show, and I have waited a long time to say what I'm going to say. Marion-- Griffey, you don't understand. I couldn't-- Couldn't-- couldn't what? What? Marion? [DIAL TONE] I lost her. Joe, I lost her. Get her back. All right. It's going to be just a second. No, no, no. I mean, that caller, Marion. Get her back. What are you talking about? Marion, she was on her cell phone or something. Griff, the phone line's been dead for five minutes. Dead air. What do you mean dead air? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DOG BARKING] INGRID: Mm, mm. Yeah, that's good. Mm, mm. Yeah, a little harder. Mm. Mm. Mm, yeah. Mm. Oh, Blake. You always know how to ruin a good time. Mm. I'm a lawyer, honey. That's my job. Mm. It's also my office, not a massage parlor. I know. Well, it's more time efficient for me to get alcohol massage. Plus, you're only six blocks from Lionel's office. What have you got for me? Well, I did everything that you asked. Your name is now in all the papers, executor and sole heir. Mm. So now if anything were to accidentally happen to Griff, everything would be yours. Oh, where do I sign? You don't, not until you're married. Oh, that. And what about the life insurance? It's notarized and filed. I've also arranged for a yacht for your honeymoon. The captain owes me a favor anyway. And you should be at sea for two weeks. That should give you plenty of opportunity. Oh, Blake. You're so competent. I aim to please. Well, it'd please me if you would stop interrupting my massage. Ah. I could help with that, you know. You're a lawyer, not a masseuse. And remember, I'm engaged. I wouldn't think of letting another man touch me. Uh, Ingrid, this is my office. Mm. Yes. Be a darling, would you, and scat. Whatever. Mm. [MUSIC PLAYING] Maybe that electrical surge connected you to some random cell phone call. No, no. She called for a reason, but why? Well, you know, actually, I tracked her down through search engines. So-- you got to love those things. She lives here in LA. And we hadn't spoken in about 10 years. We heard the dead air. Apparently we caught a lightning bolt with our new antenna. Yeah, OK, whatever. Wait, you spoke to Tracy? We have not heard from Tracy or Marion since they left for Minnesota. Apparently she moved to the suburbs and has two kids. I thought they disappeared into a fucking black hole. Don't go crazy, man. She's going to come over tonight. What's the deal, Mr. Griffin? Did someone come back from your past? No. It's nobody. But was it someone you knew, like an old flame? It was just a girl I used to know a very long time ago. She disappeared, never heard from her again. I actually think it had something to do with her father. He never really liked me much. Well, maybe he was trying to-- I don't know-- protect her. Oh, you think so? Least she could have done is told me to fuck off, I mean, anything. Do you know that I hitchhiked all the way to fucking Minnesota? Have you ever been to Minnesota? I searched all over those goddamn lakes and never found her. It sounds pretty cold. And no wonder you wrote this book. That's-- that's got nothing to do with it. I haven't given her a second thought since. I see. Marion. [MELANCHOLY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Marion, why didn't you call 10 years ago? And where are you today? MARION: I'm upstairs in your bed, where else? Marion? Marion. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Oh, Griffey, I missed you too. I tried to call as soon as I could, but-- Yeah. And about that phone call, what kind of childish prank was that? And why didn't you ever return any of my letters? And when did you move back to California? Hey, when did you start being such an old fart? Got any champagne? Oh, yeah. No, no. You cannot come waltzing back into my life without a word and climb into my bed-- my bed. No. You have to get out of my bed right now. Jeez, put some clothes on. Jesus, my fiancee is on her way over. [SIGHS] Griffey, don't be so silly. Don't you remember how good we used to fit together? Yeah. It was a long time ago, Marion. Not for me. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh my god. It's Ingrid. Jesus, she will not understand this. She will not understand. She can't see me. Yeah, you're damn right she can't. - Griff. - Come on. Get in here right now, quick. [OTHERWORLDLY SOUND] Don't move. Stay put. INGRID: Darling, are you upstairs? Yes. No. No, I mean, I'm on my way down. Hi, honey. Hey. You left the door open. You really should be more careful. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know. Anybody could come in. Wait. You are not wearing that to dinner. Wait here. - Well-- I'll go pull something out of your closet. All right. Well, don't get it-- no! I mean, I can't-- I haven't-- the-- [DOORBELL RINGS] I was expecting somebody. Oh. Hi. Hey, stranger. You know, it was so bizarre, Joe just calling me out of the blue. Oh, I didn't know you had company. Tracy-- Tracy, it's good to see you. It's OK. Tracy, this is my fiancee, Ingrid Frost. Charmed. God, it's so good to see you. Look-- come in. Come in. I mean, you look great. Ingrid, Tracy's sister is the one who's up in-- back from my high school days. God, I mean, what happened to you guys, Tracy? Well, I married a wonderful man. I have two beautiful children and a house out in Simi Valley. How great. Is that picture of-- Yeah, Marion. Yeah. I painted it a year after you guys moved. You know, that was-- that was a pretty cold thing that Marion did, breaking up with me like that. You know, maybe it had something to do with the fact that she promised to spend the rest of her life with me. I don't know. I just never really got over her. But I did put all that in my past, honey. So, Tracy. What I really want to know, I mean, so that-- so I can really put the past behind me for good was if you could tell me why Marion dumped me like that. You mean you don't know what happened to Marion? Well, I have a pretty good idea where she ended up. Joe didn't tell you? Well, he said I should get it from you. And well, here you are. Oh, Marion really cared about you, but good old daddy didn't think you had too good of a future. Back in your starving artist days, huh? Yeah. Well, you know, that's kind of funny because really it was her father that sort of encouraged me to succeed and, well, so I'd be good enough for Marion. So tragic to lose somebody. Yeah-- lose? What do you mean, lose? What, she find a new boyfriend and just didn't have the courage to tell me, to say goodbye, adios, anything? Griff, you should probably brace yourself. All right. [SIGHING] You know, it was really dark outside, and the roads were icy. There was lightning everywhere. I was the only survivor. And even I was in a coma for over a year. Wait, wait, wait. Coma, what do you mean? Oh, wait a minute. Now I understand. Sure, sure. Trauma could have caused someone to be so twisted around that they would become obsessed. Yeah, that's it. Griff, you're not listening to me. No, no, no. It's perfectly logical-- first, a trauma, then amnesia, then obsession, and then even stalking me. It totally explains what might have happened to Marion. I suppose it could, but it doesn't. Well, what do you mean? Griff, Marion died 10 years ago. Yeah, right. I know that it's hard to believe. Yeah, extremely hard. [SIGHING] You know, after I got out of a coma, I had to disconnect all ties. I had to start fresh. Exactly what Lionel suggests in his book. Now we have a dinner engagement. Yeah, sorry. Um-- You know, I'm sorry if any of this hurt you. Marion, she wouldn't have wanted it that way. Yeah. But the house looks really great. [CHUCKLES] Lot cleaner than I remember. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, well. It was really nice seeing you. Yeah. And you know, I still think about her. And I know that she's up there, just waiting. Yeah. You could say that. Well, great to see you. Bye. Bye. Huh. Well. Excuse me one minute. [OTHERWORLDLY SOUND] Don't tell me. You see dead people. I am dead people. Look, why are you here? Griffey, we left something unfinished, and I have the chance to fix it. We need to make love. Wha-- what? No, no, no. I can't. I won't. Look at you. You're some kind of ghost. Well, got any champagne? What-- what is with the cham-- OK, look. I must be nuts. Fine. We'll have a few drinks, talk about old times, and then you'll go back wherever it is you're supposed to go. Great. I'll go get the champagne. No, no. I will bring the champagne up. You just stay out of sight or whatever. Lionel! Oh, Ingrid. I'm sorry. I can't go to dinner with you. Something's come up. I-- I got to get out of here. [SITAR MUSIC, DRUMS PLAYING] Wow, great place. Yeah. I'm into candle magic, as well as other things. You know, it's amazing the deals you can find at the supermarket. Good vibes-- Mhm. --I guess. I vacuumed. I wanted tonight and this place to be absolutely perfect. When we met, it was just-- In the produce department. Yeah, near the squash and the sprouts. You know, there's a reason why we were brought together. There's something-- Sounds kind of cosmic. I like that. Yeah, me too. [MUSIC PLAYING] I think we just unblocked your qi. We definitely unblocked something. Your qi, it's your life energy. And it's important that it flows to all points of your body. It definitely flowed. Yeah. And that's only the beginning. I brought my sage, my tarot cards, and Kama Sutra oil. Well, that's good because I brought my toothbrush. Good. We have the whole night to ourselves then. Cool. [KNOCKING] You order pizza? No. [KNOCKING] Come in. [DOOR OPENING] Hey. JOE: Griff, come on in. What's going on? Um, I need to talk. Look, I'm interrupting. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. We'll see you later. I'm Lila. Have a good-- Hi. Ooh, heavy vibes. Your aura is all messed up. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Look, I should go. Yeah. We'll see you. Call you tomorrow. Joe, it's OK. He just got here. Well, I don't want you to have to leave. It's OK. You guys have guy talk to do. I understand. I can just stay at my girlfriend's. She's right next door. Yeah. You know, really it's-- I'm OK. It's OK. You know what? I'll see you tomorrow, OK? [DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] She's sweet. Yeah. She's sweet. She's pretty kinky. She unblocked my cheese whiz or something. What's up? I saw Marion tonight. You mean you saw Tracy tonight? I saw her too, but I saw Marion. And she looks exactly the same. What are you talking about? Marion, she was naked in my bed. And I put her in the closet because Ingrid came. And then I went downstairs and saw her in the refrigerator. And then-- - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. OK. You're telling me that there was a dead chick in your bed, so you took her to the closet. And then you took Ingrid and threw her in the refrigerator. What am I going to do about Marion? This isn't about Marion. This is about Ingrid. Oh, no, no. Ingrid I can handle. She's alive. Hey. Do you think this had something to do with that power surge we had today? I mean-- - No. Come on. I fixed that. What if-- what if something else happened? What if we brought something over from beyond? Got to lay off the coffee. You're freaking me out, OK? I know you got your book. I know you got your marriage. I know you got your show, all right, but you got to-- you're totally stressed out. Look at you. Yeah, well, maybe. But that does not explain Marion. All right. Let's talk about that ice queen, Ingrid. When's the last time you slept with her? We don't exactly sleep together. I mean, we don't spend a lot of time in the bedroom. OK, right, like the back of your Chevy, the kitchen floor. I had this Asian chick once, and we used to just do it in the elevator. Are you saying that you don't sleep with her? We respect each other. Oh, boy. Look, I have an 18-year-old spook living in my house, and I want her out. All right. You got to go see a therapist. I am a therapist. Act like one. Right, right. OK. So whether she's a real ghost or a projection, she's entered my life at a critical point. Right, when you're on your way to the loony bin. Yes. Yes. She's symbolic of my lost youth-- the freedom, the passion, the fun. Yeah, of course. OK. So you're all right now? Yeah. We're fine? There's no ghost in your house? OK, cool. Can I stay here tonight? Yeah. [BIRDS CHIRPING] OK. Look, I know you're just a projection of my-- superimposed on my super ego. And that's it. And I'm OK with that. You're just a figment of my imagination. [OTHERWORLDLY SOUND] [GASPS] If you're going to talk to me, you better talk to me while I'm here. Oh, Jesus, I thought I was. Great. Now you've got me talking to myself. What is that you've got on? I found it in your drawer. Is it yours? No. That is for Ingrid on our wedding night. Don't they give you people clothes where you come from? I cannot have you running around here naked. Well, why not? Well, uh-- You're the only one here that sees me. Uh, because, uh, it distracts me. Look, I've got to go to work. Millions of people are expecting to get advice from me today. Well, hurry back. I want to see you too. I want to hear your voice. Well, then you can just listen to my show. I will. But this time, be nice. You're always so rude. No, I'm not rude. I'm just-- I'm sensible. Well, you used to be so carefree. You wanted to be an artist. What happened? I guess I grew up. I think you grew up too much. And we're ready for our next caller. Hi, Griff. It's me again, Laura. Hey, let me ask you a question. Do you believe that your dreams can come true? Hm. Well, Laura, you know, last week, I would have told you not to believe in anything except what was right in front of you. But now I think we have to be open to a lot of things, including your dreams. What kind of dream did you have? Well, first I dreamed I met the perfect man. Then the next day, I did. Really? Tell me about it. He took me on my first picnic. I never knew sex outdoors could be so thrilling. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's great, Laura. That just goes to show you that your dreams can come true. So folks, the moral here is never give up on your dreams. Thanks again for calling, Laura. We're ready to take our next caller. Go ahead. Hey, doc. This is Paul in Pennsylvania. I know you disapprove of going back to the past, but I started seeing my old girlfriend again. That's great. How long ago were you apart? Six months. I couldn't get her out of my mind. Yeah, I know the feeling. How are you doing now? Great. We were both miserable, then we realized we could work it out. That's great. Best of luck to you. We'll break for a commercial, and then we'll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Griff. You sure you're feeling all right? Never better. Hiya, Toots. What's happening? I'm picking out China patterns for the wedding. Stop by Franco's after your show so you can help me. Mm, no. That'd bore the shit out of me. Why don't you go by yourself? Lionel, what's come over you? We have plans this afternoon. We're on a very tight schedule. Uh, no. I promised Marion I would take her for a walk. You mean Marion, your ghostly little friend? Yeah. She didn't get out much. Hello, hello. You're on the air. I'm Candy. You're, like, so laid back. I don't have a problem. I just wanted to say you've got a killer show. So Candy-- How long has he been acting so weird? Since yesterday. He came to my chick's house, said that he needed to sleep over because there's a ghost in his house. Mm, uh huh. He's been obsessing about that old girlfriend of his. Well, that's going to have to stop and now. You know, my girl thinks she can do exorcisms. Maybe she can. Hm, really? I like the dress. Sheer echoplasm. I made it myself. I heard your show. You're sweet. Where did you meet that-- Ingrid. My lawyer, Blake, introduced us. He thought we'd be compatible. She's not right for you, Griffey. She's not right for the Griffin you know. 10 years older now and I'm a different person. You know that. You're the same inside, the same boy I fell in love with. I can prove it. Kiss me. God, I love you. Marion, I-- I want to keep you in my life. I just-- I don't know how. Did you listen to his show today? He's behaving like a lunatic, a nutcase. Well, he sounded harmless enough to me. Yeah. You don't have to sleep with him. And neither do you. Hey. Anyway, this is perfect. You know, you go ahead and marry him. I'll have a friend of mine who's a psychotherapist certify him that he's crazy. And have him locked up in a loony bin? Yeah. What are my friends going to think? I'll be the laughingstock of the neighborhood. I think I'll indulge him just for now, but I've got something in mind. Stella, go ahead and take off. I'll lock out. Thanks, Mr. Peters. See you tomorrow. Now, what is this little plan of yours? GRIFFIN: Chapter four, more pictures, maybe trees. Yeah, trees are nice. Oh. Big problems with chapter 10, Putting Your Past to Sleep-- maybe a rewrite. Hey. Hi. Why don't we go drink some champagne and dance? You, stop trying to tempt me. Uh, no. Just throw it out, skip to chapter 11. Marion. Look, we can be together, just not like that. Can't you understand? I promised Ingrid I would marry her. And you promised me you'd make love to me. Oh, please. Marion. Ingrid and I are faithful to each other. Oh, really? Are you sure? Yes, absolutely faithful. I would stick my life on it. Yes, woo. Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh. [LAUGHING] All gone. Isn't this stuff great? Oh, yeah. I'm going to go get some more from the kitchen. Hey, maybe you better take it easy on this stuff. Hey, I'll be right back. [KNOCKING] [SIGHING] [DOOR CLOSING] Hey, guy. What was with that act on the radio today? Got my ass chewed out. On the show? That's the new me. They hired the old you, you know, the authority on relationships guy, not this UFO, spiritual, conspiracy theory guy. Yeah, it's just the new format. Besides, I didn't say anything about UFOs. We'll do that tomorrow. [CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS] Is that a champagne cork? No. Mice. Mice? That drink champagne? It's a very exclusive neighborhood. Joe, relax. Take life much too seriously. Me? They're going to fire you. I'll get another job. Hey, maybe I can paint. [LAUGHING] Maybe you need a bachelor party. All this Marion stuff is getting way out of control. Joe, Joe. Do I look uptight to you? No, you don't. And that's what's getting to me. What is that? It's just a little poltergeist activity, nothing to worry about around here. What were you saying? I'm saying, buddy, we've got to get you a bachelor party. Going to call your friends. We're going to get together. It's going to be a good time. You are my friends. All right. The two of us, we're going to go downtown. We're going to drink some beers, get some girls. Yeah, now you're talking. Yeah. GRIFFIN: Yeah! We'll be doing some dancing, getting some strippers all up on you. It's going to be good. Yeah. Yeah. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] All right. Uh, later. Oh, yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] Whatever he saw, he won't believe it. Hey. Are you still ticklish? Oh, no. No, no, you don't. [LAUGHING] [SITAR MUSIC PLAYING] I have Ingrid's number right here. So why don't you give her a call? OK. [DIALING] Yeah, Ingrid? Hey, it's me. Uh huh. Lila's here. She's ready. OK. We'll see you at Griff's. No, no, no. I got everything, got the whole nine yards. Got the bell, the book, candle. All right. OK. All right. Going to have a psychic intervention. [INSECTS CHIRPING] [LAUGHING] So when was the last time you laughed like that? Never. You are a little she-devil. Griffey. No. I meant what I said. Marion, look. I told you, we can stay together. You just-- we just can't-- Do it? Yeah, right. So I'm here because I'm a good tickler? I can use a good laugh every now and then. So what other parts of you are ticklish? No, no. [LAUGHING] [OTHERWORLDLY SOUNDS] [DISTORTED ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] Well, get over it, pal, and get a life. Next caller. WOMAN: Hi. I've read your books, and I got a question. Well, if you'd really read them, then you wouldn't have any questions now, would you? WOMAN: I was going to ask about my husband. He's as big a jerk as you are. But you answered my question. I don't have to put up with this. Good. Another satisfied caller. You're listening to "Rational Romance." I'm Dr. Lionel Griffin, and it's New Year's Eve. MARION: Griffey, I've been waiting for you. Griffey, I didn't go anywhere. I'm still here. [CAR BEEPS] Griffey. Hey, I know that seance wasn't your idea. Griffey, just-- if you ask me to come back, I can come back. Just ask. Course, darling. Yeah. Taking it to the dumpster as we speak. INGRID (ON PHONE): And about the New Year's party, all the best people will be there, so we need to make a good impression. Pick up your tux at the dry cleaner's. We're expected to be there at 8:00. [TAPPING] I can't get in. INGRID (ON PHONE): Lionel, did you hear me? Huh? Yeah, of course. I just-- nevermind. INGRID (ON PHONE): I'll stop by later with Blake. We have some papers for you to sign. Fine. I'll see you then. [TAPPING] Please, Griffey. It's cold. [CLEARS THROAT] [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I just can't leave him. Stupid, not blind. I could just see it now. He has too much to drink, slips and falls on the wet deck, and I'm rid of him. Hm. You bitch. I wonder if I should push his body overboard just to be sure. What, and wait seven years to have him declared dead? Nah. We need a body. Look. You bastard. Have him sign here, but for God's sake, don't let him study it. I put a loophole in here that makes you sole heir whether he is married to you or not. Oh. All of his assets would be transferred to you in his untimely death. Let's get this over with. Meet me on the corner in 20 minutes. I'll arrange to have us all meet at your office, and then we can head to the party, OK? [CAR STARTS] I've got to get into that house. See, I don't get it. And you know what? I don't like it. Now he's a complete asshole. Liked him better when he was crazy. Something's coming through here. It's not good news. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] A loving woman, the home-- helplessness, restrictions. This is really heavy. Failure, death. Maybe I better go check on him. There's an exchange that's going to take place between two people. I don't understand yet what it is, but there's an exchange that's going to take place. MARION'S VOICE: I can't get in, but somebody else can. Lila, pick up a crystal. [MYSTICAL SOUNDS] Are you OK? Well, I could stand to lose 10 pounds. And these nails. [GROANS] Oh. I'm glad to see you got in touch with your feminine side. Beer? Champagne is so much better. That feels much better. Lila, what the hell? I got to go. Griffey needs me. [DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] Baby, I can sign this later. You know what? Let's just get it out of the way. We don't want to worry about a thing on our honeymoon. OK? Here. Whatever you say. And there. Perfect. I trust you. You're going to be my wife. And we will share everything. Yes, baby, everything. You know what? I think I'll run this over to Blake's. Yeah, but-- So don't forget, his office, 8 o'clock sharp. [SIGHS] [KNOCKING] Are you expecting someone? No, not that I know of. Hi, Lila. What's up? Where's Joe? You must invite me in. You're awfully formal. Fine. Come on in. Thank you. Hey. [LAUGHING] Sorry. I couldn't help myself. You've always had such a great vibe. God, I've missed you so much. Yeah. Well, why don't you sit down, make yourself comfortable. Would you like a beer? No. Beer's icky. Got any champagne? I do. OK. What are you looking at? Nothing. There's nothing on the wall. Looks kind of empty without Griffey's painting. Yes. Well, as much as I love discussing art, I have to go. You don't have a car. That's right. I'll walk. Thank you. 8 o'clock, Mike's office. Be there. Honey, kiss. Oh, thank god. I thought she would never leave. Look, I don't have much time, and I really got to tell you something. I love you so much. That's awfully sudden. I want you to be my first. Your first what? Griffey, I need you to make love to me. [LAUGHING] What's gotten into you, Lila? She's planning to kill you. I overheard her. She is planning an accident on your honeymoon on the yacht. Wait a minute. How did you know about the-- Excuse me. Wait a minute. You're drunk. Lila, go home. No, no, no, no, no, no. I know things that you don't know. Listen to me. Right. People all over the country call me for advice, and you know more than I do. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is you're just-- you're just too sweet for your own good. Sorry. I'm a little-- Griffey, you can't marry her. You cannot marry her. You sound like a jealous teenager. Listen to me. [HICCUPS] [CLEARS THROAT] Griffey, don't be such a grown up all the time, OK? Look, I'm not listening to you anymore. Just go. - No. It's me. It's me. Marion? Yeah. How? The wand, crystals, magic. Come on. Let's go out to the pool and talk. So where is the lucky man? Exactly. Be late for his own funeral. Well, it's still early. Idiot, standing me up on New Year's Eve, doing god knows what with god knows who. Well, we'll give him another half hour. That gives us just a little bit more time. Griffey, what's the one thing that stands between you and I? [CORK POPS] Ingrid. But look, let's leave her out of this, OK? No. I mean, the one incompatibility we have. There's not just one. There's a hundred. I mean, I have a different life now. I have a life. That's the difference. OK. Well, would it be so bad if you joined me? I mean, if you were where I am and what I am? You're dead. I know. Well, I don't think I would like that very much. Well, if it means keeping you happy, me going-- well, I wouldn't want you to die just for me. Wait, what do you mean die? What are you talking about? Well, that's the only way we can be together. And I don't want that if you don't. Well, I don't. I like breathing, thank you very much. But that woman, she wants you dead. I heard her and that lawyer talking about it. All right. Stop right there. OK, I understand jealousy, but when you start talking lies about the woman that I'm going to marry, it's too much. Griffey, I told you a long time ago I'd never lie to you. I don't want to hear it. Griffey, why are you being so hardheaded? Look, please just leave me alone. Wait, Marion. [GROANS] Griffey, Griffey? Griffey? Hm? Griffey, are you OK? Oh. Yeah. [GROANS] I guess my head isn't as hard as I thought it was. [HAUNTING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I'm not sorry. But you have to want to be with me. I do, more than anything. [MUSIC PLAYING] God. You're such a flipping wuss. Couldn't you have driven any faster? On New Year's Eve with all the cops out there? Yeah. You're so slow. And I still can't believe we didn't make it to the party. Ingrid, don't you trust him? Yeah, I trust him, but there's nothing funny going on. Where the hell is he? God, I've always loved you. I know. I know now. Oh, god. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh my god. We've got to call the paramedics. No, no, not so fast. But-- but-- Blake, don't you see? This is absolutely perfect. No, but we got to do something. We can't just-- Blake, calm down. But-- Look, he's already signed the paperwork. Now I don't have to marry him. Let me see. Griffin, wake up. No. I'm so sleepy. Griffin, wake up. You have to go back. No. I'm going to stay here with you. That was easier than I thought. You mean he's-- Yep, he's dead. Oh, you're a very wealthy woman. [LAUGHING] [GASPING] Hey. You hit me. I had to. You have to go back. It isn't your time yet. No. I'm going to stay here with you. Griffin, I can't let you die to do it. You kept a promise. You said you'd make love to me. And it was wonderful. I can leave in peace now. You have to go back. No. No, I'm not leaving you. Marion, I have found what I've been looking for all this time. I found it again. And I am not going to lose you now. But you have things to do. You can't let those two get away with it. No. Marion, I'm not going to leave you, unless you tell me you don't want me. Then I don't want you. Go. Go. Lionel! I mean, I thought-- I thought you were dead. I was so scared, honey. No, I'm very much alive, Ingrid. It's your little plan that's dead. The wedding's off, Ingrid. So get the hell off my property. This is all your fault, you and your stupid plan. Well, you said he was dead. [LAUGHING] Oh, my head. Hey, Lila. Oh. Lila, Griff. What's happening? Hey, Joe. How did I get here? Marion had something to do with that. Oh. Hey, it's almost midnight. Don't you have plans? Yeah. Um, what happened to you? Uh, took a little dip in the pool. Well, that's good. Good to have the old Griff back. [LAUGHING] Hey, I'm not getting married, Joe. That's really good. You want to come with us? Come on. No. You know what? Go on. I'm going to stay here. All right. See you next year. Happy new year. [DOOR CLOSING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I guess I can go now. I just stopped by to say goodbye and thank you. It's good to see you one more time. You know, a long time ago you promised never to leave me. And now here I am, leaving you instead. You came into my life at exactly the right time when I needed you most. And now you're leaving me more alone than ever. It doesn't seem fair, does it? I'm sorry. I'm not. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HAUNTING CHORAL, INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
