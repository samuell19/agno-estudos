Make those lines fast. It's the last load. Get those crates ashore. [dramatic music] - [Roy] Hey, hold it! Those crates don't unload there! - Yeah, why don't they? - Well, I'd have to truck them back 20 miles! You were supposed to deliver them at the inlet! - I know, mister, but I can't sail the Apache Rose on a mudflat! - [Roy] Well, you're lucky to sail that thing at all! - That's very funny! While you're laughing at your jokes, I'll unload your equipment! - That won't do any good! I'm in a hurry! I'm trying to get a well started! - Oh, so you're Mr. Coast Drilling Company, huh? - That's right, Roy Rogers! I put the order in for that equipment! - And I'm giving the orders on this tug! Unload 'em, boys. - Wait a minute! I told you I don't want this stuff unloaded here! Get that hook off and put that big crate back on! We've gotta get it down inlet! - Yeah, but she said-- - Listen, mister, I give the orders here! Get off my tug! [Billie screams] Oh, you lousy jarhead! You pushed me! - Well, you did it yourself. Here, let me give you a hand. - Not on your life... [hooves thudding] - [Carlos] Billie! - Carlos. - [Carlos] Billie, what is the matter? - This big knothead here thinks I'm gonna haul his crates up and down the coast on a pleasure cruise. Look what he did to me, Carlos. I must be a sight. - Roy, well, I'm sure glad to see ya! - Alkali, what're you doing here, you old horse thief? - Horse thief? - Oh, Roy's just joking. Weren't you, Roy? - Well, I-- - You'll be happy to know I got my old job back again, foreman on the Rancho Vega. I heared they was starting up again. You two know each other? - Not officially. - Carlos, how about saying howdy to Roy Rogers? - Howdy. - How are ya? - What was all the arguments about these crates? - Well, I'm drilling a test well back on the mesa. They were supposed to deliver this equipment at the inlet. It's pretty heavy and I have no way of getting it back there. - If he can get it there, he'll sure strike oil. Roy's one of the best wildcatters in the business. - It seems to me he is a very good friend of yours. - Sure is, used to punch cows for me in Texas before he started to punch holes in the ground [chuckles]. Maybe we can help him. - I don't see why not. I think we can get that equipment in for you. Alkali, take some of the men, and go get one of the big wagons. - Well, thanks, Carlos. I can sure use the help. The rest of my crew haven't arrived yet. - That's all right, Roy. Just save us four or 5,000 barrels when that well comes in. - Rogers, I wanna talk to you! We have a little matter to settle. - [Roy] Yeah? - Yeah, get your money out. All these shipments are COD. - [Roy] Well, that's all right with me. - That's all right. Roy pays off like a slot machine. - Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. - Here's your money. - There's your receipt. - Come on, Roy, let's go get the wagon. - Well, that's a fine thing. You lend him your wagon. You let him use your road and you give him your men. - But he did nothing to me. - Well, he did to me. Carlos, I don't know. That's the trouble with you. You're too friendly with strangers. - But you are still a stranger, unless you have changed your mind. - You mean about giving up this tug? Mm-mm, I like it. My father liked it. I guess it runs in the family. - But you would like it better at the rancho. You would have the hacienda and your own servants and-- - Oh, Carlos, you're not going to propose to me again, are you? - But you have never said no. - I haven't said yes either. Carlos, how can I take you seriously? All those escapades and not forgetting that weakness for gambling either. I don't like it. - Billie, I have given that up, honest. - Wanna make a bet? - Why sure, anything. - See what I mean? - Ah, you are always kidding me.

We're on the Rancho Vega property. - Where does that trail lead to? - Down by the ocean. - If there is oil around here, it might show up on the other side of those rocks. - Oh, I wouldn't go down there, Roy. - Why not? - There's caves down there. Nobody never goes near 'em. They're haunted, strange things happened. Folks have gone down wandering around, and, and just plum disappeared. - Well, I'll take a look anyway. [dramatic music] You better get those silver bullets ready for those ghosts, 'cause we're going in. - Feel that air coming out, it's cold. It's just like a graveyard. Roy, wait a minute, Roy. [dramatic music] My knees are a little shaky. I feel another one of my spells coming on. - Go on, Alkali, you never have one of those spells util the going gets tough. - Oh, Roy. [dramatic music] Wait a minute, Roy! You ain't got sense enough to be scared. I'll just come along. [dramatic music] - Roy and Alkali just came into the cave. [dramatic music] - This is the hideout where the smart rustlers used to keep their stolen cattle. - Well, you're smart. - Sure I am. Hey, wait a minute. I wasn't one of them. I used to hunt for them. Bandits like Joaquin Murrieta. - Well, that's interesting. Murrieta's been dead 87 years. - Well, I wasn't talking about him. I was talking about his son, Joaquin Junior. He was a worse bandit than his old man. - Never heard of him. - Oh, Roy, let's get outta here. He was killed right here in this cave. - [Roy] Oh, come now, Alkali. - It's the living truth. I hope his ghost comes back to haunt me. [dramatic music] Look! [guns firing] - Stay where you are! - Don't shoot, Roy! It's me, Alkali! [waves crashing] - [Roy] Where'd you get that flashlight? - [Alkali] I found it on the ground. - Joaquin Junior with a flashlight, huh? - All right, it wasn't Joaquin. It's somebody hunting for buried treasure. - There must be another way of of here. Oil. - [Alkali] Oil? - Here's your buried treasure. - Oil [chuckles]. - That must've been testing equipment those fellas were carrying, come on. [engine revving] [dramatic music] [gunshots] - [Roy] We'll never get them now. We better go back and see Carlos. - Roy, I guess, you were right. When you quit the cattle business. That wildcat nose of yours can sure smell hot oil. - Those three fellas just left here in such a hurry seem to like it, too. I wonder if I'm drilling in the wrong place. - Black gold, that's what it is. Roy, we hit a fortune. - Yes, but for your friend Carlos. - Yeah, I suppose we have to tell him about it. - You said it was his land, didn't you? - Yeah, of course, if we're going to get technical. - Maybe I can make a deal with Carlos before those three live ghosts get to him. [hooves galloping] - [Alkali] Hey. [Alkali] Ah! Yippee! - Carlos, Carlos! Yippee! - That crazy Alkali, he is playing Indian again! - [Alkali] Carlos, we found it, a bonanza, oil! Pumping up out of the ground down the old rustlers cave. - We ran into some men down there, and they started shooting at us, but they got away in a car. They weren't your men, were they? - No, I have no reason to send my men down there. We have always known the oil was in the caves. - You have? - Oh, you think you have discovered something bigger. Ever since I was so high we was use that oil for medicine. - It's one of the best oil formations I ever saw. I'm surprised you haven't tried to develop it. - I could not have done so, even if I would want to. You see, the land title has just been cleared through the courts. I only have half interest. The other half belongs to my cousin, Rosa. - Well, think of all that money. Oil wells springing up like mushrooms. You ain't gonna just let that oil sit there, is you? - Easy, Alkali. Rogers, you know what a gamble it is. We would have to borrow money on the ranch to start the drilling, and then take a chance on losing it. - Well, it wouldn't be much of a gamble. - Well, we will leave it up to Rosa. She is coming tomorrow from Mexico. I will talk with here. She may change her mind, but I don't think so. - I'll see you later, Carlos. I have a little oil business of my own to take care of. And thanks again for the use of your wagon. - Si. - How do you like that? An ocean of oil in his backyard. Blast me for a horn-swaggled idiot. I never should have told him. - I'm surprised you did. - What you looking at? - There is something strange about that face! - What's the matter with my face? - If I could only remember. - Now, don't tax yourself, Felicia. Just relax. Roy! - That face, that voice. That blank stare. He must have done something. Oh, I got no time to remember! - Meet me in town tomorrow, I'm going to introduce to Rosa. Kind of casual-like. We've got a fortune right in our hands. We don't want to lose it. - Okay, I'll be there. - Senor Carlos, your cousin Rosa says you have to wait for her. She'll meet you at the cafe. - Gracias. - Gracias. - Jose move the carriage and wait for us. - Senor Carlos! Make yourself sit down, please. We have enchiladas, frijoles, tamales, chili peppers, tortillas. - Enchiladas, frijoles, chili peppers, tortillas! I'll take ham and eggs. - Si, Senor. - Nothing. - Hello, Carlos. - Oh, hello, Calhoun. - Take a walk, will ya? - I just sat down. - Alkali, give us a couple of minutes. - Sure, I'll be around if you need me. - Who is that, your bodyguard? - I did not know I need one. - Well, maybe you don't. We'll let that pass. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about $147,000. - I will-- I will pay you back. I had a good offer for the oil rights at the ranch. - Well, that's fine. I was getting a bit worried. I hadn't seen you out at the gambling ship lately. - You think you'll sell the oil rights? - As far as I am concerned, but I have a partner, my cousin, Rosa. I might have a little trouble convincing her. She has some serious sentimental idea that oil derricks will destroy the ranch. - Well, Carlos, that's your problem, but I want that, ah, bill, straightened out. I don't like overdue accounts. - You will get your money. - We always do. - Carlos. What did Reed Calhoun want? - Oh, just drumming up a little business for his gambling ship. - Oh, Carlos, you promised. You'll never make any money that way. [melancholy music] - It would be a lot easier if it was just Carlos who owned that ranch. - You oughta be a mind reader. You know, I know just the fella who will tell Rosa's fortune for a few bucks. - Hi, Billie! - Hello, Alkali. - Speaks foreign language. - Oh, hello senor. - What about the orchestra that you're going to bring on your boat? - Oh, they're here. - Good! - Are you sure they are Mexicanos like I ordered? - Why, of course, senor, the best I could find. - Bring them on so I can overlook them. - [chuckles] - All right. - Would you excuse me a minute, Carlos? - Alkali? - You all set, boys? - Just about but I don't think we're gonna fool anybody. We don't even know speak Spanish. - Well, what are you worrying about? You want a job, don't you? Oh, we'll fool them. I even got the accent already. Si! - Shh! Now let me check you. Yeah, that's it. Curl this. Yeah. Senor, this is the orchestra. - [water speaks in foreign language] - Play, boys!

[all mutter] - How about that? - Now you are fired! Double Xer. - Hiya, fellas, what in the world are you doing here? - Oh, hello, Roy! [all mutter] - I haven't seen you since you sold that rodeo you didn't own. - [man] Oh now, wait a minute. - Shh! - How about doing some real work. for the Coast Drilling Company? - All right. [all mutter] - What are they doing, sponsoring a radio program? - I said work. - I need some roustabouts for the oilfield. - Well sure, Roy. - Sure, why not? - That'll be all right. - All right. - You don't mind, do you? - Why should I? You better get out of those duds, fellas. - Senor Carlos, I have big surprise for you. - Rosa! - Carlos! [giggles] - I would not have known you. - Oh, have I changed so much? - Of course you have changed. I have not seen you since you were all of 15 years old. - You were not so much older yourself [both laugh]. - Hello. - Rosa, I want you to meet Miss Colby, Billie. I almost said my fiancee. - [chuckles] We haven't agreed on that yet. - I am very happy to meet you. - Thank you. - And this is Alkali, my foreman. - Hello. - Howdy. - Alkali, will you get the carriage? - Right, coming up. Ain't she pretty, Roy? - Don't know, I haven't had a good look at her yet. - Stick around, I'll introduce you in a minute. [dramatic music] [guns firing] [screams] [dramatic music] - Better call the sheriff, Bob, he's dead. - Right. - You can see Rosa now. - Has anyone been up there? - No one has talked with her or seen her, except the doctor, Billie, and myself, but the doctor said she will be all right. - Oh, sure she'll be all right so long as she doesn't mind a bullet hole in her right arm. - I suppose you're going to hold Rogers, eh? - What charge would I hold him on? If I want him, he'll be up there at his oil wells. - I would not be too sure about that. - I'll be responsible for him, but I won't for Rosa. If you take my advice, you'll send her away somewhere until I find out more about this. - Carlos, I think you're wrong about Roy. - That maybe so, but Billie, there is no longer a mystery about this. Somebody is after that oil. - Yeah, they certainly are. - I think it's a good idea to send Rosa away, eh? - Carlos. There's one way to find out who's behind this. You're going ahead with that welcome home party for Rosa. - But how, the doctor will not let her leave the room. - But nobody else knows that. You're giving that party, and we're going to make them think I'm Rosa. - Billie, no, you wouldn't dare. I will not let you, and besides-- - You don't think I'd let a little thing like this stop me, do you? Carlos, you have just become my cousin. [hooves thudding] - Here she is, senor. - This way, Mrs. Vega. - Where is Carlos? - He's watching us. - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Thank you, senorita. [hooves thudding] - Son, run and tell senorita Vega we're waiting for. - But you're late senor. Senorita let a few manutes ago. What is that? She's gone in another carriage, senor. I have carried her suitcase. She gave me this money. - Do you which way they go? - She went that way to the Vega Rancho. - Vamonos muchachos! [dramatic music] - Driver, the other road! - Carlos told me to take this road. [orchestral music] [hooves thudding] - Hey! Carlos! [dramatic music] [gentle music] - Bob, you better help the backup man. - Sure, Roy. [hooves thudding] [dramatic music] - [Alkali] Hey, fellas! - It's Alkali. - [Alkali] Roy, I need your help! - They got Rosa. - Rosa? - Climb on your horses, boys! [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [hooves thudding] [dramatic music] [slapping effect] [dramatic music continues] [slapping effect] - Here they come, boss. - Wait, wait a minute. [dramatic music] - Hold it, he's not hurt. We'll wait for him. He knows we're here. - I'll take it, Roy! - [Roy] Thanks, Alkali. That was another close call. You must be getting used to it. - Oh, si, senor. - You boys better ride back with her to the Rancho, make sure she gets there safely. I'll go back and pick up that driver. [orchestral music] - Give me that gun. [dramatic music] [gun fires] [dramatic music] - Alkali! Oh, Alkali, you are to bring my little Rosa back to me. - Go easy with her, Felicia. She's had a bad scare. - We found her, Carlos. She's all right. - Ooh, somebody hold these horses. - Carlos! - Rosa! - [whispers] Hey Billie, what happened to you? - [whispers] Like a dummy, I got into the wrong carriage. [whispers] I'm glad, it was me instead of Rosa, though. - I'm so glad that you are here. I can hardly control myself. - Oh, cousin! - My little Rosa! After all these years. - Felicia, you remember Felicia, eh, huh? - Oh, si! - Felicia, my dear deuna. - Oh, my old Rosa back from the dead! - Oh, stop it before you make us all bust out crying. - Oh, we haven't been introduced to the senorita yet. - [crowd mutters] I'd sure like to meet her. - She's all upset. So many things have happended today. - [crowd mutter] Well yeah, you have had a rough time. Felicia, take Rosa to her room. - We have your old room ready for you. - Felicia, you think of everything. Gracias. - Senorita, you make a wrong mistake, your room is this way. - It's been so long I almost forget. Gracias! - Carlos is right, she's very upset, but sometimes I'm forgetful, too. - Sometimes that's a blessing. - That reminds me, there's something about you if I can only remember. - Carlos, you'd better send somebody out to bring in that driver. - Where is he? - Top of the mesa road with a bullet in his back. They wanted to make sure he wouldn't talk. - Rosa, this is your old room, and I will unpack the grip a little later. I want you to take a good rest. Oh, that's my senorita. I am so glad you are home, oh! [phew] - Then you don't know who fired the shot? - I couldn't tell. They got away in a car. - I think we had better phone the sheriff. - [Alkali] Sure, that's just what I was thinking of. - Carlos, I found this on the body. Does it mean anything to you? - It is a $50 credit for the gambling ship. Might have some connection, but this doesn't prove anything. - I'm afraid you made a mistake bringing Rosa out here. - Well, it was a plan to find out who was trying to kill her. We were going ahead with the welcome, the homecoming party, just as if nothing had happened. - It's pretty dangerous business. I hope you know what you're doing. - I promise you. She will be well-guarded from now on. - You'd better turn that over to the sheriff. We'll wait for him out on the road. He might be able to identify the body. - [Billie] Senor, Senor Rogers. - Oh [speaking in foreign language]. - In English, senor. I maybe practice. - I just wanted to know how you knew my name. - Oh, that's right. Carlos, Carlos, my cousin, told me. I want to thank you, senor, for saving me from those guys. I mean, those hombres, ooh! - Oh, that's all right. - You will come maybe to the party they give for me, no? - I think that's a good idea. - And you will bring your friends too, no? - [Roy] Sure, I'll even have them play for the party. - Thank you, gracias. Adios, cowboy! - Adios, senorita! - Now ain't that sweet? Boy, that Rogers sure works fast. - See you at the party, Carlos! [hooves thudding] [crowd mutters] - Hello Calhoun. - Oh, it's you again, huh? You indians are all alike. Another touch, I suppouse. - What do you care? Carlos has dropped plenty of money out here. - Strictly IOUs, but I'll get it back. - Sure you'll get it back when you get the Rancho. But don't forget you wouldn't know anything about that oil if I hadn't have told you. - Well, I wouldn't say that, Pete. - Always remember that somebody might be listening, - So think before you talk. - Yeah, thanks for the advice. - Fix him up with anything he wants. - Pete? - Yeah? - I heard something about a homecoming party for Rosa tomorrow. What about it? Well, I thought you might like a little extra gambling money. - $2,000. You are not giving that kind of money away for nothing. - That's right, Pete. - Now you're getting smarter. - Charlie, set him up over here.

Do you look for somebody? - I wonder where Billie is? - [Billie] Billie? - Yeah, the girl that runs the tugboat. The one that Carlos wants to marry. - [Billie] Oh, she should be here, shouldn't she? Maybe she and Carlos have a little argument. Senor Roy, do you think this girl, Billie, make my cousin, Carlos, a good wife, hmm? - He can have her. - [Billie] You do not seem to approve of her. - She's all right if you like her type. - [Billie] What's the matter with her type? - Well, if you must know, she's too hard to get along with. Snooty, nose in the air all the time. And that hair of hers is just about the color of Trigger's tail. - Well, of all the crummy insults. I mean it! You Americano's say. [whimsical orchestral music] [castanets clicking] [audience applauding] [playful music] - Oh, senorita. - What is it? - You better let me in. - Why? - Because I have your hair. [whimsical orchestral music] - You're pretty smart, aren't you? - I think you better tell me what the masquerade was for. - Well, if you must know. I was only trying to help Carlos. He wanted to find out who took a shot at Rosa. - That's fine making a clay pigeon out of yourself. - Oh, come now. - Hey you, what you sitting around up there for? - [Pete] Aw, keeping my eyes open in case of trouble. Just like Carlos told me. - Come on down here and keep your eyes open. This is where the work is. - Okay. - You see that? Even he could've taken a shot at you. - Pete, oh, don't be silly. - Pete or anybody. You can't trust any of them. There's a million dollar oil field at stake, and they're not gonna let anything stop them. - Maybe I'd better get out of this. - You'd better keep it on. If you wanna help Carlos and Rosa keeping from being killed, you put that wig back on and do as I say. [whimsical orchestral music] [Billie screams] [gun firing] [crowd murmuring] - [Man] What happened? [crowd murmuring] - [screams] My Rosa, she is dead! - All right, stay back! [crowd murmuring] Rogers, I will kill you for this. - Now, hold on, Carlos. Let's find out about this. Who did it, Roy? - I did. - Roy, well you know you didn't, why? - What did you kill her for? - She caught me looking for the geologist report telling how much oil there is on my land. - We'll take care of him in our own way. - Wait, hold it. Give me the guns. Lock him up in the wine cellar until we found out what has happened. - Don't you worry, Roy. You'll get a fair trial. I'll go get the sheriff. - Sheriff, well, you better lock him up too. He's as guilty as I am. - Sure, I'm as guilty as he is. - [Bob] You too, Alkali? - Me, what am I saying? - Lock him up also. - Carlos. - Take him away. - Don't touch me! [gasps] I feel like I got another spell coming on. [Alkali gasping and groaning] - [Billie] Shut that door. Lock it quick. [Felicia crying] - Rosa, the senorita, she is not dead! She is not hurt! [screams] She is not Rosa! - Hey, please. Hey, Carlos. - All right, now suppose you do a little explaining. - Carlos, this was for your own good. I can explain everything, please. [whimsical orchestral music] - Hmm, this 1911 went a little sour. Now let's see. We have a little ah, ah. [playful music] This 1895 really went bad. Still feel a little rocky, huh? - Oh, sure it is. [dramatic music] [lock jangles] - It's no use Alkali. The door is locked. It was kind of a mean trick pulling you in on this murder charge, but you were gonna tell the sheriff, and I didn't want him to know about it. At least not now anyway. Besides if I didn't have you along, I'd be down here talking to myself. - All right, Roy. I guess I am a little stubborn, but there I was sticking up for you, saying you didn't kill her. - I didn't. - Oh, what'd you confess for? - She isn't dead. I just wanted to make it look that way, so we could trap the real killers. If they think she's dead, we might be able to find out who they are and what their next move is. - [Alkali] Roy, are you sure you didn't kill Rosa? - Senor Rogers is telling the truth. I am very much alive. - You can hear for yourself. Hurry up, skipper, get that hatch open. - Well, what do you think I'm trying to do, playing mumbled pig? [door click opens] - What're you doing, what're you doing here? - All right, here are the guns. I am sorry I had to take them away, but I had to make it seem real. - Thanks, Carlos, any new developments? - No, but you had better not go until it gets dark. - Shh! [dramatic music]. Get over there. [dramatic music] - I can't see. - Anytime you wanna find the wine cellar [sniffs], just follow your nose. [sniffs] - Well, there's no guard here. - Yeah, but there may be one inside. - We'll do just like we planned. Batter down the door, take away the prize, and remember we go on the count of three. [dramatic music] [playful music] - It's The Pioneers. [loud crashing] [dramatic music] - Three! - [Pete] And when it got dark, I followed Roy and Alkali to a cave down by the beach. - We've gotta get smart about this. There's one little detail missing. Nobody seemed to have notified the sheriff. - That's right, but everybody was excited. - Always give the other fella credit, Pete. Rogers might have an angle. Now look, you go tell the sheriff what happened and ride out there with them, and when you show what's happened to Rosa, come back here at the usual time. - Right.

[orchestral music] - All right, you landlubbers. Come on, get anchored, let's take on a little ballast here. - Best town any language. - You'll be lucky if Alkali doesn't eat plates and all. - Don't stand on manners, Billie. Just help yourself [chuckles]. - Yeah, I see what you mean. Hey, boys. [hooves thudding] - Over here, Alkali. - It's the sheriff. - Yes, and he's got Pete with him. - No, no, no, boys, in the hatch quick. [plates clatter] [hooves thudding] Hello, Sheriff! - Hello, what do you know about the goings on at the Vega Rancho? - Me? I don't know anything about it. - We've been looking for Rogers in the caves. He's wanted for murder? - Murder? - Yes, murder. - Around here, listen, you'd have heard me scream plenty. Any guy that'll push a girl in the water is liable to do anything. He's a dangerous man. I can see it in his eyes. - Shows you never can tell. He didn't seem like a man who would shoot down a woman in cold blood. - [Billie] Isn't that awful? - Say, you sure do eat a lot. - Oh me, yeah, I have an awful appetite. I guess it's this ocean air. Sheriff, how was she murdered? Where was she shot? - That's what I'm going to find out. I'm going up there now and have a look at the body. - Body, listen, Sheriff. Why don't you stop by Roy's oil well. He may be hiding out around there. It isn't much out of your way, and it won't take you much longer. He's dangerous, he's a killer. I wouldn't let him be at large. - That's a good idea. Come on, Pete. - Yeah. [hooves thudding] Come on, boys. [hatch door slams] Did you hear that, Roy? That squealer, Pete, must be one of the men were after. - That's a good joke on the sheriff riding all the way up there, and he ain't gonna find the body [chuckles]. - Roy, I think we'd better follow Pete. - We'll follow him, but after he finds the body. - But, Roy, I just-- - Alkali, we've got to beat the sheriff to the hacienda. We'll see you later, Billie. - Yeah. [suspenseful music] [hooves thudding] [Alkali mutters] [hooves thudding] - [Roy] Now, remember what I told you. - Si, senor. - [Roy] Hurry. [knocking on door] - Yes? - Sheriff Mason. - Yes. - Who is that? - My poor little Rosa. - [Sheriff] You were right, Pete. Let's take a look. - Yeah. - No, no, no, no, not you! You go do your work! Go on, vamos [door closes] - [Roy] Just a minute, Sheriff. I wanna talk to you. - And I wanna talk to you. [hooves thudding] Well, I guess that clears you, Rogers, but I don't see why you didn't handle all this through my office. - That's easy, we didn't know who we could trust. - What? I have a good mind to run you in for a remark like that. - I mean, I mean, Roy! I gonna have a spell. - Senor Roy, senor Roy! Senor Roy, I was watch like you tell me, that Pete was ride towards town! - You see, Sheriff? We'd better pick him up and question him. - Yeah. [orchestral music] [Alkali gasps] [dramatic music] [townsfolk chattering] - [Pete] He told me to meet him tonight at the usual time. - Wait, let's see what he's doing. - See you later. Oh, don't forget. Save me a seat on that eight o'clock boat, will ya? - Eight o'clock. - I'd sure like to know who he's gonna meet on that boat. - We'll follow him and find out. - Uh, uh, that ship's on the high seas. That's out of my jurisdiction. - Well, it isn't out of mine. We'll trail him for you if you wanna trust us. - Well, in this case, I guess I'll have to. - Good, Alkali, round up The Pioneers, and meet me at the cave tonight. I'll keep an eye on him until then. - Sure, Roy.

Roy, the tug's all ready. - Good, it's time, we're getting up to the gambling ship. - I'm ready. - If we're not back in an hour, boys you know what to do. - You bet. - Yeah. - Let's move. - Check the time, now. - All right, boys, cast off. - Aye, aye, skipper. [tugboat chugs] - Roy! Hey, Roy, stardboard! Port to stardboard. [water spashes] Step on the emergency. - [door closes] [Alkali It's eight o'clock. - Yeah, it may be just a coincidence, but let's go in. - I'll get you in. I'll show you how I did it for Dewey in the Battle of Manila. - 50 years ago, huh? - Well, I got in the Navy young. Lied about my age. Roy, help me [mumbling]! [Alkali gasps] - Watch those windows. [gamblers mutters] - Alkali! We've got it. IOU's signed by Carlos Vega, $20,000, $4,000, $15,500. It all ties up, Alkali. They let him run up a gambling debt, so they could force him to sell that oil land. - Yeah, but only Rosa wouldn't sell. - Well, you're on time. - Yeah, brought you some good news. - Good, come on into the office. [gamblers mutters] - Rogers! [dramatic music] [slapping effect] [lamp clatters to floor] - Wait a minute, wait a minute! I got a spell! [slapping effect] [dramatic music] [books clutter] [slapping effect] [furniture clatters to floor] - What're you doing by that door? [dramatic music] Hey! [dramatic music] - Alkali, are you all right? - Sure, they never laid a hand on me. - Well, then somebody better watch that referee. Come on, let's get outta here. [dramatic music] - Get going, Billie! - Hey, hey, somebody stops them! [dramatic music] - We were too late, boss. - All right, get them out. - No, not you. - Okay, boys, outside. Come on, back to your tables, back to work. - Hey, you sure messed this up. - Well, gentlemen, there's $147,000 worth of IOU's missing. That means we pay a little visit to Carlos. - I can't go back to that ranch now. When do we get the rest of my money? - Don't worry, Pete, you don't need it. [dramatic music] [waves crashing] - I told you they were playing for keeps. - Poor Pete. - Poor us, sure could've used him as a witness. - Well, there's nothing on him. I've been trying to get something on that Reed Calhoun for a long time, so I could clean up that gambling boat, but he'll probably wiggle out of this one too. He talks fast and he's got a smart lawyer. - I wasn't gonna mention these, Sheriff. I was gonna give him back to Carlos, but since it turned out the way it did, maybe you can use them against Calhoun. - They're IOU's. - Why that matinee caballero, almost getting Rosa and me killed over a gambling debt. - I wouldn't blame Carlos too much. They went after him deliberately, and framed him so he'd lose. - It's the oil on Carlos's land, Sheriff. They're trying to get him to sell the rights to it. - So Carlos has been holding out on us. We'd better talk to him. - I think it's a pretty good idea. Hey, wait a minute. Who's gonna watch this body? - That'll be your job, Billie. - Me? - You'd better stay out of this. There may be some shooting. [waves crashing] [hooves thudding] - Look, you don't think you're gonna take over these rights for $147,000. - You have me all wrong, Carlos. I don't want the ranch. I just want the oil rights. - The oil rights? Then you are the one who's been trying to kill Rosa. Jose, get the sheriff. [Felicia screams] - The sheriff won't do you any good where you're going, Carlos. - So that's the way it is. - Well, we'll stretch him out a little bit, and see if we can change your mind. Put him in the car. [Felicia cries] [dramatic music] [car starts] [bell tolling] [dramatic music] [guns firing] [dramatic music] Come on, get in! [guns firing] [dramatic music] [gate crashes loudly] [guns firing] [tires screeching] [dramatic music] [guns firing] - Well, we can still make it. - You stay here with me. Help me hold them off until they get the boats in the water. Take him with you. We'll cover you. [guns firing] [dramatic music] [slapping effect] All right, get going. [guns firing] [dramatic music] [gun clicks] [gun fires] [hooves thudding] [waves crashing] [slapping effect] [dramatic music] [water splashes] - I, I think it is my arm, Sheriff. - Well, we'd better look at it. See if we can't fix you up. - I am going to need it. Rosa and I are going in the oil business with Senor Rogers. [waves crashing] [orchestral music] - Carlos, it is too bad that you lost her. She would have been a beautiful bride. - Bride, bride? That is it. That is what I have been trying to remember. You promised to come back and marry me 25 years ago. - Did I? - But you are my Alkali. You are my Alkali! Sweetheart, I will still make a lovely bride. [loud kiss] - That's done it!
