THE FIVE DAYS Trust me... the message was clear: the revolution has begun. Today, they'll attack the prison, and free all of us patriots. How many of us patriots are here? Five. Thrown in amongst common criminals. Just like cattle... Those damned Austrians! They will pay for this too! Shit! Who did that? Who was it? Quit it! I'm not kidding, who was it? So? Was it you? - Go back to sleep, you animal! - I want to know who did this! Piss off! What the hell! That's disgusting! - What's the situation like in the city? - The Austrians have lost their hold... All of Milan is up in arms. We have to be careful when the attack begins, though. This rabble must not get out. I'm for the revolution, but not for anarchy. My heart aches... at the thought that our people are about to get their freedom. Help! It's the end of the world! The patriots are here to free us! The end of the world! No, not my head! Bastard! Help! OH, BELOVED LIBERTY! Patriot! Finally free! Freedom! Freedom! Not him! He's a thief, a crook! He's no patriot! He's a criminal! He wanted to kill me - catch him! Don't let him get away! - Cainazzo! - Hey, Garafino! - You escaped from jail? - Yeah, and I'm gonna look for Zampino. Not that way, or the Germans will catch you too! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! Professor! Hey, Pollicino! Cainazzo! Look who's here! Hey, Cainazzo, weren't you in prison? Yes, but a cannon blew a hole in the wall. Who knows how many friends we'll see now, right? - And Zampino? - Zampino isn't one of us anymore. We haven't seen him for a week. Hurry, we've got to take care of the loot. Those crazy patriots have suddenly decided to fight us thieves! - And I don't understand why. - Where is he? He's my boss, and he owes me half from our last heist. He was smart and escaped, and I went to jail. I already told you: I haven't seen him. He's disappeared since the revolution began. Remember what a great talent he was? Holy cow! He cut more throats in Milan than the Austrian executioner, Radetzky! He was a good kid! Now they say he's a patriot, a hero. They call him 'Liberty' now. He's one of the heroes of the revolution. - Who? Zampino? - Yeah, Zampino. No way! Yes! Don't give me that bullshit. Yes, it's true: he's a hero of the revolution. Well, it's his business... Tough luck for him. What's under there? Oh, him? Who knows? He came in uninvited. You idiot, didn't I tell you to find a place for him? Ouch, you hurt me! Nice shoes... - May I, Professor? - Of course, my brother. This is some rich corpse! He's based at the revolution headquarters, on Bigni Street. Maybe you'll find him there. Be careful; his name isn't Zampino anymore. He's called Liberty now, that fool! If you're going over there, take a flag, and no-one will give you trouble. No - not that one! - Are you crazy? - Why? That's the Austrian flag! Put it down! Put it down! Calm down! What the hell! Not that one! That's the wrong one! Go to hell! Which one then? Which one? Which one, Professor? You dunces! The one with a green stripe! Green? This one! This one is nice too. Look at these nice colors. - Long live Italy! - Long live freedom! - Death to the Austrians! - Long live the revolution! Where are you going? Come on, my friends! Let's go fight! You always stay behind! Remember: when they shoot, lie down! - What's he doing? - Dunno! How should I speak with you? With the friends of Governor Casati, who has two sons: one is an officer of Carlos Alberto, and the other one is studying in Austria! And that's not the only such example: most of you noblemen have sons or relatives closely tied to the enemy. Should we pretend that we don't know that Conte Borromeo's son... is an officer of the Austrian army? You are traitors! You Republicans are causing chaos in the city. You opened the prisons and incited the rabble! The people of Milan won't get killed... just to change from the rule of the Asburgo family... to the rule of the Savoia, those cut-throats! The people are fighting for freedom, and you're tricking them! My sons, that's no way to talk. Shut up, you priest-lovers! You think we don't know that you want to hand Milan over to the pope, Pious IX? You're bathing in shit, up to your necks! If you intend to act this way, you know what? You can just shove it up your asses! Damn Savoia! Where are the 4,000 guns we were promised for Milan? What is this shitty King doing? The city is teetering on the verge of anarchy! Carlos Alberto is afraid that everything could go the wrong way. If things don't improve, he will... He, like all kings, is an enemy of the people! Excuse me, how far away is Turin? Over a hundred miles away. And... - in which direction, please? - West. - Then, this way? - Yes. Carlos Alberto... fuck you! What did you say? Me? Nothing, Your Majesty. Oh. I thought I heard someone call me... What does our messenger from Milan say? Things have gotten worse. The people are up in arms. The authorities have disappeared and the republicans, or worse, the socialists, are turning the people against you, Your Highness. History, my dear friend, will prove us right. Don't send any help, and stop the volunteers from Turin. I like Milan less and less. I didn't understand much of what they were saying. They don't seem to agree with each other. You dunce! That's a discussion... a free discussion! In other words, democracy! But what is this 'democracy'? Freedom for everyone, you get it? Even an idiot like you can have his say. Oh, great... But those people there had their say... while you didn't. So where's this democracy? You don't understand anything! What you mean is anarchy. And that's a mess: everyone talking at the same time, and nobody understanding anything. Instead, democracy is... With democracy, after centuries of monarchy... OK, but are you sure my friend Liberty went to the barricades? Sure! While the others talk, he's taking command. He goes around, here and there, riding a white horse. Actually, we were partners. Partners? In what? We had a lock business. Before this mess... before the revolution began, he wasn't known as 'Liberty'. Actually, I don't even know if he's the same person I'm talking about. What a brave and generous man! Our kind of gifts! The Austrians are bombing us! Then we should... Where did he go? Generous... brave! Brave my butt! THE FATAL ENCOUNTER Who is it? Damn you! Are you crazy? Are you trying to kill me? You lost your voice... and I gave it back to you. How? By beating me up? What the hell! You're so ignorant! Haven't you heard that fear is fought with fear? Sure! I don't know... Do you know what they say in my town? Fear enters through your mouth... and comes out your... You're right. I pissed myself! What can I say? You saved my life! Pleased to meet you, Marcelli Romolo. Oh, right. - Are you from Rome? - Yes. - Why are you in Milan? - I'm working at my uncle's bakery. The bakery... My uncle's bakery! My uncle moved to the North a long time ago, a few months ago he wrote a letter to mom. He wrote: "Let Romolo come here. There's work for everybody. "Stop eating your feet"! So here I am. - You know the rest. - Yes, I understand. - You've been yapping on about it for two hours. - What about you, Cagnazzo? Cainazzo, my name is Cainazzo. OK, I'm sorry. - So, where are you from? - I'm from prison. You wouldn't... I don't have any money, Corcazzo! Cainazzo! - But I'm not in the business right now. - That's better. Clear agreements make a long-lasting friendship. What long-lasting or short-lasting friendship? Who wants you? Who knows you? - If you're going to act like that... - Of course I'm going to act like this! Okay. - Listen to me. - Who, me? - Are you my brother? - No. - Are you my cousin? - No. - My uncle, my father? - No. - Then why are you following me around? - What? Why are you bothering me? Why are you following me? I'm not following you. You're just always in front of me. Listen, kid... are you trying to make a fool out of me? Dressed like that! Don't you see that everyone is looking at us? Why, what's wrong? - You're ridiculous. - Ridiculous? Why? It keeps me cool! Rome boy, we're going separate ways. I'm going this way. What a coincidence! You're going my way! I'll come with you! You animal, where are you going? Not over there... no! There! Good. Be careful! The candlesticks! Be careful! The candlesticks! You idiot, can't you see it's upside-down? Oh wonderful, two more. Great! Just great! Come and help us build our barricade. Long live Italy! It's all coming along so well! Now the closet. Look, Countess Tortiglioni. See how well things are going! This barricade is a masterpiece. In a short while, Barni, the painter, will paint a picture of it. Excellent! Two more volunteers. What are your names? Marce -- See you later, Countess! You two, go to the first floor, to the salon, and get the long satin sofa. Satin, what? You are so ignorant! It's a long, white sofa! Go now! Now go quickly! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Get to work, boys! Oh, these common men...! Look at them! How can you handle a Caravaggio like that? Hey, I can see every inch of your little ass! Come on with those chairs! Quick, I said! Finally! Come on, honey, he'll paint your picture later. You'll see! Come on, here, there! There! Quickly! Here! Here! There it is: the long, white sofa! No, not there. Here! Here! Here! Hey, you! Where are you? Hey! Do you know where the Square is...? Look at them! Where are they going? They're running like thieves! Sorry. Cainazzo... you said that... Why are they doing all this... this revolution? For something called... called democ... de... Oh, I don't know what it's called... And for the freedom of the press. Are you interested in the freedom of the press? Are you kidding? I'm a "literati". Help me, gentlemen! - Ma'am! - Help me! Ma'am, what's wrong? What is it? - Please, I'm going to give birth. - What do you mean? I'm sorry, but how can we help you? I live here, but I can't get up the stairs. We can take you up! Come with us! The labor pains are starting! - I can't make it! - Calm down! Watch the step. You'll see: it's nothing. - Don't get excited. - The step... Easy... One... Take her! Wait... Is she dead? No, she's still breathing. She's as heavy as a dead body. - Oh my God, it hurts! - Calm down! Easy... easy... Ouch! - I'm falling down! - The leg... - The leg! - What leg? Mine, you jerk! - Ma'am... - Wait... Where's your apartment? - The top floor. - Holy cow! We need to plan this out. Just a second. Don't worry, we're taking you up. Pick up her legs! Put her legs over your shoulders! This one too! Come on, it's not very far. Are you ready? Come on! Slow down, I can't see anything. - Push! - Everything?s gone black! - What is it? - Are you pushing, or what? Ma'am, control yourself, please. - Why are you talking like that? - She pissed on my face! - Really? - No, it's my waters! My waters broke! See, you idiot? Her waters broke! - What waters, ma'am? - Who knows! You're tough, aren't you? Not like the Austrians! Why did he have to follow me, this Southern pest? You are the Southern pest! A DIFFICULT CHILDBIRTH My God... Cainazzo! There's nobody else in this building! - What do you mean? - I'm telling you: the place is deserted. So there's nobody else? Everybody ran away when the Austrians got here. Where's your husband? He went to Legnano. He was supposed to return, but I'm alone now! I'm ready! Help me! Us?! Yes! For Christ's sake, help this baby come into the world. But Ma'am, we aren't doctors. - Right? - No, we aren't. You can't leave me alone. For God's sake! This is no easy matter. You're giving birth, ma'am. We'll go now... and look for someone who can help. Yes, maybe a woman or something. No! Help me, please! Don't leave me alone! No! No! Don't leave me alone! I'll die for sure. Help me! Help me! How did she think we could do something like that? She's really crazy. Don't let me die. Right... It's not so easy... I don't know... No, no... We did the right thing. Yes! Sure! My God! I'm dying! You must tell us everything we have to do! We don't know anything about this. Well, start by boiling up some towels, then heat some water. A lot of water. And boil the scissors too: you'll need them to cut the cord when it's all over. Yes, cut. Cut! Get the enema! Quick! No! Over there! It's ready! - Now take off my clothes! - Yes! And now? Help me get into position. And now? - The enema, quick! - Yes. There! - Are you ready? - Yes. Go! I'm sorry. Wait a second. Wait. It's a little... Just a moment... No, not there! In the back! - What do you mean, in the back? - Take a good look! Take a good look... I can't see - it's all confusing down here! Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry, I have to take a look. Go! Are you sure? Yes. I've got my hand in there, just to be sure. Go, go! How's it going? Everything OK? Look at this! What a job! Here you go - it's hot! They're hot, and you hand them to me? Cainazzo! I see something! - What? - It's coming out! Come on, we're almost done! It's almost over, you'll see! I'm pushing! I'm pushing. A little more... - Can you see him? - There he is! Is he breathing? He's breathing! He's breathing! Cainazzo, we're fathers! How cute he is! Here, ma'am... Here... Careful! Thank you! Thank you! What pain! But I promise the Virgin Mary that before going through something like this again, I'll sew it up! There's nobody here? Did they all leave? - Where are we? - I don't know. Cagnazzo! Listen to me: we have to... Ouch! My name is Cainazzo. It's not Cagnazza, Carcassa, Fracasso, Colcazzo... Those aren't my names! Cainazzo, understand? Come here. Repeat after me: Cainazzo... - What's your name? - What's my name? I don't know. You're asking me? What the hell! Cainazzo, that's my name! See? Is it my fault if you have a funny name? So I'm ridiculous? - Am I ridiculous? - Put your hands down! You stupid idiot from the South! ?Stupid idiot from the South? to you! Damn! Don't bite my head! Don't bite my head! I'm leaving! I'm leaving you alone! Don't bite my head! This time I'm really leaving. Let's see how you manage without me! Quiet! What is it? You hear? Milanese? Germans! Holy cow, the Germans! Oh! The Countess' barricade! There's nobody here. They all ran away; it's deserted. Did you see that? Hey! Hey! - What? - Who is it? What? - I didn't say anything. - Who spoke? Hey, you two! You two! - Which two? - Us two. There's two of us! Right. Get down! - Why? - Get down. Down! Why do you care? Just get down! I said: get down! - You want us both to get down? - On your knees! Slowly? Down! Down... Excellent! You see how well they shoot? Look, how wonderful... Quick, somebody help me! The architect is feeling sick! My God! What's wrong with you? I feel so sick, Countess. So sick... The salts! Quickly, he's fainted! - What are you looking at? - How much powder do you use? Hey, friend of the Pope, you certainly know how to use incense in churches... but you know nothing about guns... Not only you, of course! The Pope too! But you... Who the hell loaded this? Who's that son-of-a...? - Who was it? - Him! It's true: I saw him too. - Countess, your tea is ready. - Thank you, Mariano. Fight for freedom! Push those dogs back! Zampino! Cainazzo! Watch out, Cainazzo! Are you crazy? - Damn it! - Who was it? It was Zampino, my friend! Fire! No! Be careful, you animal! Good work, dear! Shoot for our country! Are you hurt, dear? Does it hurt badly? No, no, no! No? You're not hurt? Yes, but not my cock! It's my back. My God, how beautiful they are! How brave, my Milanese! And what muscles! - If you knew how bad they smell! - What do you know? THE MILANESE, MY PEOPLE Long live Italy! Long live Italy. What are you doing? You little rascals! Where are you taking me? Whoever makes a move, gets killed! It's my turn! I was here first! Cheater! You jumped the line! Don't push! Shut up! Or I'll slap your face! Really? One moment. I was here first. Do you want to fight with your brother-in-arms? How many of you are there? What are you going to do? Every noble organization is comprised of the following people: first: the master. He comes up with the idea. Second: the thief. He's the one who does the stealing. Third: the beast. He's the one who does the beating. Fourth: the fast one. He takes everything away. And finally, the stick. He is the one keeping the look-out. Now, since there are only two of us, we should divide the work. What can you do? I can... I can... I don't know. I can't do anything. Okay, then we'll do this: I'll be the master, the thief, the fast one, the beast... and the stick. Hey, are you listening? Otherwise, how can we be partners? Oh, my God. - Who's that? - Who? Hey, Garafino! It's Garafino! Cainazzo, a wonderful job! Where? The Palace. A fine haul! - There's nothing left? - You can try, but hurry! I love the revolution! - Holy cow, how ugly he is! - Let's go! Yes. THE BIG JOB Is this the palace? Nobody's here? It's closed. I can't see anything. Look! It's open. I was wrong. Sorry, Cainazzo. Let's go. Your friends have wrecked the place! Hey Rome boy, there are some clothes. You should change yours. At least you'll stop going around half-naked. Cainazzo, what do you think? Not so bad: short sleeves, for the summer. I took the first that I found. Let me check again. No, let's go. I'm scared. Shouldn't we be going? Pretty boy, if you want to be my partner, you have to wake up. - It's not possible for a thief to be afraid of the dark. - No? - You... - My God, what is it? Go to hell! You're always on my ass. You scared me! Damn... There's nobody here. Can't you see? Why are you scared? What a mess... Oh, finally! I'm dead tired. Hey! Hey! Marcelli Romolo, pleased to meet you! Pleased... What are you doing, talking to yourself? - No. - No? So you're talking with... Who are you talking to? Hello! Pleased to meet you! Who are these people? We are here by accident. We didn't mean to... No, we didn't mean to! I feel sorry for you: there's nothing left here. This is my nephew. She's just a little... weird. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Good evening, miss. Please, get comfortable. You must be tired! I guess you must have lived... through the glorious and memorable days of the revolution, right? Yes, we are patriots! Long live Italy! Long live Carlos Alberto, our savior! Hurray! Stop that! Get down, you're hurting me. So, tell me: what do you think the people will get from... this glorious, tri-colored affair? The freedom of the press. This is what you're willing to be disemboweled for? Incredible! What other nonsense have they put into your heads? There are men today, longing for power and wealth, who want to drive the Austrians out of Milan... and need you, the people, to do it, and you, fools, are willing to get killed for them... because you naively think that you'll be better off afterwards. And instead, you won't get anything at all. It's true! Nothing! This pile of crap... You shithead! She fell! - Did you get hurt? - You idiots! Don't you understand that you're the true, real enemy for the noblemen? With the others, it's merely a problem of dividing the pie. One way or another, they'll crush you. Of course, if you can save... your skin! There! Get your ass up, Rome boy. The lesson is over. Who knows? Maybe one day you'll make them pay for everything. But it will be a long time before that day arrives. You have a long way ahead. So, Brandini - what is the situation in Milan? Your Holiness, the situation is difficult. It seems that the city has provisions only for two more days, - because of the Austrian siege. - What about our clergy? They're helping the people out, Your Holiness! We're worried, you know? We'd be very displeased if Lombardy and Veneto... ended up in the hands of Carlos Alberto, that syphilitic. You know what? I'd rather support a Republic. But Your Holiness, the Republicans are heathens. Brandini, with heathens we can negotiate, but with the others, always talking about Pious IX... What does Colonel Dugini say? He says that the Austrians will have to pull back. It's a matter of hours. Send a message to the Committee in Milan, to our dear friend Casati, to bring order to the city, and not to give arms to everybody, otherwise I won't enter into Milan. I won't let my troops meddle in an anarchic fight. And tell them to put aside the Catanias and the Cernuschis! THE DUCE Wake up! Italians, awaken! What are you doing here? We were sleeping. Yes, but just a little... I'm Baron Tranzunto. Marcelli Romolo, pleased to meet you. No need to introduce yourself! What's this over politeness? Are we at war or not? I'm looking for volunteers, men who will fight on my orders. You seem in good shape. Join us! - Actually, we were about to... - What? - We were... - What? - We... - Yes? What? - What? - Yes? - We were there... - Doing what? - Nothing. - When? - But sir, you're not letting me talk! - No need to talk! This is no time for words, it's a time for action! Be brave, when your country calls you! Join our glorious troops! Follow your leader, your Duce! Glory awaits you... shiny and eternal! There's no royalty here: we're all brothers. Just call me 'Sir Baron'. You got it? What? I mean... did you understand what our Duce said? No. You always want to understand what the noblemen say? Of course. Why, shouldn't I? No! What kind of noblemen would they be? Can you imagine talking with a nobleman and maybe saying to him: "Excuse me, but you're wrong"? - What do you think would happen then? - I don't know. What would happen? You're such a dunce! They wouldn't be noblemen anymore! And a beggar like you... could even talk with them, one-on-one. Keeping on like this, instead, they can speak their own distinguished language. You don't understand, because... look at yourself... and when they talk to you, you should always just say "yes". Really? The way of the world, Rome boy. Now, let's go see for ourselves what this fucking revolution is about. I'm curious now. Revolutionaries, unite! Let's sing together! What the hell, show a little love for your country! Patriots, shoot for our freedom! Fire, patriots! Long live free Italy! Our day has arrived! Long live free Italy! Death to the Austrians! Liberty! Zampino! Zampino, wait! Zampino, come here! - Excuse me, ma'am, may I come in? - No! - Ma'am, open up please! - No! Ma'am, please! Be kind! That old bag! She wouldn't let me in. Where have you been? I was trying to catch Zampino. Damn, I missed him once again! Stop! Don't shoot! Victory! We've won! Superintendent Kraus gave the order to surrender. They waved the white flag, but there was nothing to do. They were all slaughtered. Let's go! Austrian pigs! Romolo! Cainazzo! Cainazzo! My brave fighter! Did you find your friend from the South? We will avenge our brave companion! And we'll also avenge the citizens killed by German hatred! What about us? What did we do to the prisoners? What are you talking about? This is war, my patriot! March, everyone. Let's make new conquests! Let's go! Did you hear the Duce's orders? # Three colors! Three colors! # # Italian men go singing. # - I'm sorry - was he a friend of yours? - Yes. Poor guy. He only wanted to go back to Rome, back to his mother. THE LAST WORDS, AND OTHER EVENTS What's happening? Our hero, Binetti, is dying. He was wounded by the Austrians. Terrible news! I beg your pardon, what did Gino Binetti do when he was alive? - What? - What was his trade? - He was a porter. - A porter? Oh, a porter... Nothing but a miserable porter... This, citizen Caziano, demonstrates how they lie when they say... that heroes are never born from humble people. - Isn't that true, Count? - It's true! - The heroes of our history! - Bravo! Let's pay him proper homage. In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. What a patriot! His last words were... "Long live our great Italy." Well, actually I heard him say... I don't mean to contradict you citizen, but I think he said: "I'm dying, goodbye everyone." Excuse me, dear sons, but I believe you're both wrong. I was much closer, and I positively heard: "Long live Pious IX!" - No, he said... - Pious IX, my eye! Binetti, a Republican, would never have said that. I clearly heard him say "Austrians are scoundrels!" How could you have heard? You were the farthest away. You're a liar! - Who? - You! Calm down. - I didn't want to say anything... - Go ahead, talk! but, since I was in the best position, the closest to the bed, I distinctly heard what he said. I must talk, now. Binetti murmured: "Milan to the Milanese... the noblemen to the gallows!" Savoia! Stop, in the name of God! Damn! Who was it! Damn you! Did you hear what Binetti said before he died? Of course I heard. He said... "Fuck off, all of you." So I heard him right! Do you smell food? Smells good, huh? Yeah! "Party... of... the... people... of Milan." Milanese! - That's for us! - Let's go! - Are you here for the party? - Yes. Okay, come on up. Not you! Look how you're dressed! Mother of God, you're disgusting! Go away! Go! Bye. Bye. What are you waiting for? Come on. Hey, boss - is there food at this party? Of course there is! Otherwise, why would you be here? Right. Why would I be here? Hello! What are you doing? Should I take off my trousers? Why? No, let go... Why? Let go! Get your hands off my shoes! Don't touch my shirt, it's a new one! Have you always worked here? Actually, I hadn't eaten for two days... I read "Party of the People", and came here. Don't worry, the leftovers are for us. "Party of the People", ha! They fixed quite a party for the people! - What a splendid room. - Yes, there's war, but... Oh, how wonderful. Everything is so beautiful! The ways of the Lord have no limits! We weren't used to having parties any more. There will be others, little Countess! And you, as always, will be the most admired. Don't say that. You're making me blush! Eminence, what an honor! It's a pleasure to have you all here. It's just right. No, thank you; I don't drink. Just a sip can't make you dizzy. More than Paris, the other towns. I've always wanted to travel! I think it's too late for us to go back. But this rage must stop! What are the people thinking? My dear sons, don't forget we are here to reach an agreement. But how? How can we reach an agreement, when the situation is getting out of hand? Well said! I agree! I guess my trip here has been a waste of time! How boring you are! Aren't you tired of talking politics? Too many young men are fighting! Let's settle for this! I'm telling you. I saw her with my own eyes, with Marengo! Just the other day! She was getting off her coach. You should have seen her face when she realized I was there! She had the color of a pepper! And she's the one who was always preaching around! And with Marengo... who's twenty years younger than her. A kid! Maybe we've been defeated, but are you sure you're the winners? This is sophistry, Colonel. The important thing is shaping the course of history. Thank you for your wonderful gift! Everything must be clear, first! - Would you like anything else, Your Excellency? - No. Give us some time to think. What a marvelous outfit! Didn't you see it? It just arrived from Paris. It was a miracle. It came the day before the revolution began. Let's be reasonable! The emperor... is it true they found him in a haystack with Roberti? Oh, Jesus and Mary! Who is this man? I've never seen him before. Brave Citizens... Victory is ours. The Austrians have fled. The city is free. You wretch! What happened? How dare you criticize the War Committee... that's leading us in this revolution? But... I just said that they're killing us, and that we should only despise them! Teach these scoundrels a lesson! Mind your own business, OK? Run away! The Austrians are coming! Cagnazzo! Cagnazzo! Damn! Cagnazzo! Romolo! It's you! You're alive! Look what they did to you! You look like a bagpipe! Run! The Austrians are coming! Never mind! I was the one who shouted that. Come on, get up. Slowly! Slowly... - You got smart. - Sure! They were going to kill you. Cainazzo, I think that the fat man was right, when he said that we are worse than the enemy for the noblemen. We should just obey and shut up. Everything's OK... as long as you don't talk, otherwise they beat you up. Right! - But weren't you dead? - What? I was saved by the Virgin Mary. And then I ran away. When I came back, I started looking for you, but neither you nor the Duce were there anymore. There were only the dead. My god, how many dead people! We must find a way to get out of here. I can't take it anymore! Besides, we never eat anything! Hey! But... That's Zampino! Let's get him! This time he won't get away! Wait, slow down! Wait, don't run! - I can't make it! - Quick! I haven't eaten for two days! I'm pissed! - There he is. - Where are you going? Come here! Wait! Let's go! My shoe! Wait! Cainazzo! Damn you, I told you to slow down! It hurts! - God damn... - What happened? What a bump... Let me see... Damn, what a bump. But there's nothing... Traitor and Spy of Milan A hanged man! I bumped into him! It'll bring bad luck. Revolutions are hard work! There she is: the wife of the traitor. It's strange that they let her go like that, without doing anything. Yes, it's strange. Stop crying! Your husband was a clandestine, an Austrian spy. I said sto -- That's not fair, she has to pay too. Right, citizen? Take her away, Romolo. We'll take care of her. Come with us and be quiet! We'll take care of her. She'll be punished severely. Don't resist! It's useless! It's useless! Play the game, ma'am! Trust us. Why should they kill me too? - What did I do? - Nothing. - What did I do? - Nothing. Ma'am, during these times you have to learn to endure. - Where is your house? Is it far? - Over there. Good! Why don't you come upstairs? Just a moment. No, listen... we have things to do. We have to... I want to offer you something to eat. Something to drink? Come on. THE WIDOW'S BREAD Please, come in. If you insist. We're going, right? Come! No, ma'am, forget about it. Always eating... - Is that cheese? - Seems good! Make yourself comfortable. I'll just take a little piece... I made a mistake! I only wanted a little piece... what a... - Eat up! - Yes? - Don't hesitate! - Thank you. - May I? Just a little piece? - Yes, sure. Thanks. It's really good! - How embarrassing! I made a mistake! - Take it! Should I eat? Thanks! Eat up! It's good, isn't it? - You like it, don't you? - Yes. - And the wine? Do you like it? - Yes. I'd like a glass of wine too. My poor Armandino... he used to go to Casteggio to get it, every week. This wine is smooth, dry, delicate. Boy, the traitor had good taste! Damn! I meant the widower, the corpse... - What was his name? - Shut up! Show some respect! She's a widow! Calm down, ma'am. Calm down, ma'am. Don't be like that. It's impossible to live like this! Come... Come here. Come on, ma'am! Don't be like that! Think that... Ma'am... Think that your husband is watching. Don't lose heart! It's not so easy, I'm a poor widow, all alone. I don't have anyone either. Nor Mr. Cainazzo. Isn?t that right? Yes, yes. We're all alone! See? That's easy for you. You're so young. Me? Yes, yes. Such a nice-looking young man. Did you hear that? Don't make me laugh! Excuse me for a moment! I feel all excited! It's been quite a day! What are we going to do? - Let's eat! - Right! We drink a little, then we eat... we drink some more and then eat... Did you see? Poor lady... She's been very unfortunate... She's really nice! - Nice boobs! - Nice butt! Look! See? - Who is it, your grandpa? - It's my poor Armandino! - How can we go on like this? - May I, ma'am? Thanks. - He's such a good-looking young man! - Not exactly a young man! He was almost 60 years old, my poor Armandino! But he was still... yes, still... - How can I say that? - A hard dick, ma'am? - What? - I mean, he was strong. Right! He was strong, he... Well... a little. Not exactly... but sometimes... he managed. I didn't need anything more. And then, how can I say? How can I say that? - How can you say what? - I don't know. - Tell her! - Well... Ma'am, how can you say what? You're not from Milan, are you? Where are you from? Are you kidding? I'm from Rome. - Come here! - Yes. The eternal city! How beautiful! I would love to go there! The monuments, the churches... Do you know the pope? Are you kidding? We're like brothers. Lucky you! Lucky you! Yes, but... It's so nice here in Milan! Damn! Right, Cainazzo? Yes. What...? You know, I'm a baker. - Really? - Yes. - Do you know anything about bread? - No. I knew it. You can't imagine how hard it is to be a baker. Do you know how many kinds of bread exist? More than 100, and I know them all. - How wonderful. - There's... loafs and big loafs. - Semolina bread... - Ah! - Bread with oil... - Ah! - Unleavened bread... - Ah! - Rye bread... - Ah! Come here! Mica, boffetta, siriola, piadina, michetta, modenese, cioppa, "nun thigh"... Right! That's a good one! Light bread, star-shaped bread, banana-shaped bread... Yes! - bread with pepper, bread with sugar... - My God! God, I like you so much! Bread rolls, French bread! Excuse me. Rondella, melone... You're gorgeous! Common bread, Tuscany bread, bricioletta, gnoccolino, pistola, - serpentina! - Yes! Me too! Me too! What are you doing? I have to go. I need to go home. But I don't want to wake him up. Why are you leaving? I thought you liked it here. Yes, but I really must go. Please, tell him. I don't want him to think that I dumped him. He seems happy here with you. You like him, right? Out there, it's dangerous. He is so naive. I can't let him follow me everywhere. But he's a nice guy. You'll take care of him? Yes. May I? Yes. Keep moving! Come on! Death to Thieves Cainazzo! Be careful, these are worse than the Germans! Run away! Run away! Which way is the road out of Milan? - Over there, through Porta Magenta. - Thanks. But it's full of Austrians. Thanks. He's crazy. Franz! Franz! - No! No! - Quick! Go on! - No! No! What are they doing? Can't you hear? They're shooting him. - What about us? - We'll end up the same way. - Why? - Because this isn't a war: it's a revolution. The rebels are not taken as prisoners, they're killed! - Because they're traitors to them. - But I'm not even a patriot! I have nothing to do with this. I'm not even from Milan. - Where are you from? - I don't know... but there's been a mistake. Why the hell are you laughing? Excellency, there's been a mistake here. I have nothing to do with these people! I have to go home. I was just passing by. My God! These bastards aren't kidding at all! - You see? It's useless. But I have nothing to do with this, nothing. When they take you to that room over there, see? Tell them. - It's a court. - A court? - Sort of. - Sure I'm going to tell them! Now, when they call me in, I'll tell them. They must believe me! - Aren't you scared? - Me? Yes. But why give them the satisfaction? - Come! Quick! - It's better to laugh in front of these pigs. Goodbye... friend! Bye. Come with us. Yes, I'm coming. Let me go, I won't run away. - Go! Quick! Get inside! - Let me go. Don't hold me so tight, I said I was coming. What's your name? Cainazzo. You, out! When I call you, come back inside! Your Honor, in my position as defendant, I want to explain that I'm a victim of a big miscarriage of justice. I just wanted to go home. I'm no patriot. I know you're not a patriot. You're a thief. - Isn't that true, Cainazzo? - Zampino! Holy cow! Is it really you? It's me, in person! Always in trouble! Come here. There, all done. This is so strange... I've been searching for you all over, and there you are! And I even called you 'Your Honor'. By the way, what are you doing here, with the Austrians? Can't you see? I'm with them. But they told me you were called 'Liberty', that you were a hero. I knew it couldn't be you. You don't know anything, Cainazzo. I am Liberty. I was pretending! I've always worked with the Austrians. If you saw the money they're giving me, it would make your head spin. So you're a traitor? I don't like that word. Let's say I'm double-crossing. How nice! Meanwhile, you're killing everybody who gets out of here. Why do you care? Are they your friends? No. Are you a patriot? So? Don't you understand... that this rebellion doesn't concern people like us? It's their business. Noblemen from Austria, from Piemonte and from Milan. If you're smart enough, the only thing to do... is to try to bring home a big pot of money. That's what I'm doing. Yes, but there are a lot of people fighting, and dying. And they aren't all noblemen. I've seen them. They're just poor deluded guys. Listen: it's a secret! Tonight the Austrians are leaving. - Why don't you come with us? - No, I can't. And anyway... I can't speak German. You know that, Zampino. Don't call me Zampino! - Think about it. If you come... - No! Really. The only thing I want is to go home, quickly. Listen! You'll always be a poor, miserable, thief of rags. Yes, probably a thief of rags... but I don't let my fellow countrymen get shot. Are you trying to lecture me? - You know what I could do? - Yes. Yes, I know. Damn it. Look at this idiot! Go! Get the hell out of here, you idiot! Free him! He didn't do anything. Goodbye... idiot. Have a good trip... Zampino. Romolo! Romolo! Cainazzo! - How are you? - How are you? Damn you! Patriot! What are you doing? Come to your Duce! Take your place in our glorious group. Brave fighter, a time of splendid glory awaits us. Let's go! No mercy for our enemies! Let's go! Where have you been? Damn you! I've been looking for you everywhere. I went all round the streets of Milan, and finally, who did I meet? The Duce. He wanted to know where you were. It's a real curse. Where is he taking us? Do you know? - Do you? - I don't know. - Who knows? - I don't know. Someone's saying we're going to a place called Porta Tosa. If we win the battle there, the Austrians will leave Milan. By the way, why did you leave without saying anything to me? You were sleeping. I was sleeping, huh? You just wanted to dump me. That's no way to treat a friend. Whenever I sleep, you leave me! What are you saying, you dumb head! I had to go home. I thought you were happy with your widow. - Did you get home? - No. What about that friend of yours? What's his name? Zampone? - Zampino. Yes, I found him. - Good! - He's dead. - Poor guy! I'm sorry! Cainazzo, if the occasion arises, let's get away. We can go visit the widow. She's so understanding, and nice. See this? She gave it to me. It belonged to her traitor husband. - You should have seen how caring she was! - Yes, yes! - Next time, don't run away. - No, no. - Do you want to capture a dirty Austrian? - Sure, citizen! He's hiding in that red house, He's with his Milanese lover. - We must get him! - We'll get him, that bastard! If you approach quietly, they won't realize anything. They're making out. Dirty scoundrel! Let's go! - How did you know? - I... I was spying. The girl is my fianc?e. That whore! Good! Then you're a spy! No! No! So, you beautiful Milanese, you were making love with an Austrian? Let's see if you like it better with an Italian. Dirty traitor! Well, now... ..that's enough! Let her go. That's enough. - Let's go. Forget about them. - Please, leave me be. That's enough. - Let her go. - Mind your own business. Let go! Let go, Cainazzo! That's enough, OK? Let her go. Hey you! I'm talking to you. I said that's enough! Go away! Stop! Let go! Damn you! Let go! Let go! Romolo! Bastards! He's dead. Virgin Mary! Cainazzo, where are they taking me? I'm scared! Where are you? Cainazzo! What do they want from me? What have they done to you? What do you want, citizen? Are you looking for something? No. What are you doing, crying? No, it's the smoke. Long live Italy! We arrived there, and then the others came out! So the Austrians ran away! We chased them until Porta Tosa... with the cannon that we were taking along with us, and it wasn't easy, because it's heavy! Very heavy! I have some corns on my hands! You saw what happened. We were nine, then there were only four of us left. But the cannon arrived, and we were all glad! Well done! Citizen Masini told us about a glorious episode of our fight. Now we'll listen to citizen Rodelli! Come forward, speak! Don't be afraid, speak freely. I'm a carpenter. I'm good at using nails. But not at talking. We can only say that we showed the Austrians what we're capable of. They've realized what we can do, us from Lombardy. Very well said! Modest and brave! And now... Ah, good! And you? Who are you, citizen? What's your name? So? - Cainazzo. - What? - Cainazzo. - Well done, Cainazzo! Speak louder! Don't be afraid! Everybody wants to listen to you! We're all friends! Do you also want to give a testimony of the revolution? Come on! What will you say to the people? Well... I'd like to say... Tell the people of your adventures. We're here to listen to you. Come on, talk! I think... I think they've tricked us! Yes. Yes. They have. Yes, yes. There they are. We've been tricked! We've been tricked for good! We've been tricked!
