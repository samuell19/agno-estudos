Any last words? It's morphin' time! Triceratops! Putties, grind him into blue dust. Why'd you lead me here? Was your grand plan just to die outside in the fresh sea breeze? Oh, you brought friends. Now it's a reunion. Got your distress call and zipped here as fast as we could. - Thanks, Zack. - Man, that's Rita Repulsa? The robot look is not for her. She'll look better on a junk heap. Destroy them all! ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ♪ Oh! My face! I was having fun. But you wanna get serious? Come on, let's get deadly serious. You know, I loved that face. Just like I love all the power in my new robot body. But I'll gladly give up some of that energy for a spell that kills. Billy! Trini! No! Goodbye, Trini Kwan. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Dark Dimension planning my revenge. So what are we gonna tell her? Maybe their mom drowned? No. No, Minh's too smart for that. Well, we gotta decide something quick because school is out. The others might need help searching the Dark Dimension. You can't decide quick on how to tell someone the worst news of their life. And we can't lie to her. It's gotta be the truth. - Look, Zordon's rules... - Zack! Rules can be broken for a good reason. Look, if Zordon was back like I had hoped, I'm sure he'd say that Minh needs to know. It's always just been her and Trini. She doesn't have anybody else. Who's gonna take care of her now? Our team, we've never had to deal with something like this before. No, we have to tell her the truth. - Otherwise, how's she gonna get closure? - Billy! She's a kid! She's a kid, Billy. She doesn't need to know that we're Power Rangers. She needs to know that Rita Repulsa killed her mom. We have to tell her everything. Hey. You all good? Sorry, Uncle Zack. Time flies when I'm getting my sweat on. Okay. We're meant to leave for the cemetery in ten minutes. You should clean up, get ready. We don't wanna keep the others waiting. I know. Hey, you think they've made any headway finding Robo Rita? - We can ask 'em when we see them. - Okay. Wait. One more thing. Did you get the flowers? Flowers? - Thanks. I'll go take a quick shower... - Yes. ...order you a "World's Best Guardian" trophy... - Yes. - ...then we can leave. Yes. You know, Billy always gives me a hard time whenever we're late. Guess you can't use, "But I'm a busy congressman," as an excuse anymore. Sorry to mess you around. Today's not a day I've been counting down to, you know? Yeah. Can't believe it's been a whole year. I know. Seems like yesterday. - Dragonzord! - Pterodactyl! - Triceratops! - Tyrannosaurus! - Is it me, or did that...? - Come on. Before we begin, I just want to say, unhappy anniversary, Rangers. - That's Robo Rita, isn't it? - An ambush. How predictable of you all to get together on this special day. And I've been so busy preparing. I even reforged some of my old minions. Snizzard and Minotaur. Rows and rows of human graves. This place is beautiful. Soon, all of Earth will be like this. Good. We'll start with the Rangers. Not if we end you first. I gotta help my team. But I need you to stay safe, okay? But she's the one who... We gotta take her down. I've been training for... Hard no. World's Best Guardian says, "Do not move." Zack is back... in black. - What? No "sorry I'm late"? - You'll both be sorry. None of them even complimented my fancy new machine. Snizzard, it's ready. Nice moves. But mine are better. - What the...? - Jace! A wonderful start to my collection. Time to finish you. Get her! Get her! You're the one who's finished. Show him, Snizzard. Gotcha! You think you can do better against my new powers? No chance, Pinky. Like fish in a barrel. Bring them to me. - Your friends are finished. - We'll see. It's all coming together. Hey, what kinda sick game is this? Oh, it's quite fun. My machine is draining their energy. Soon, they'll be lifeless husks. You can join them. - Zack! Billy! - We can't win here! Power down. Minh, car, now! Come on, come on. You think you can just drive away? Cowards! End of the line. Road's closed. Your move. - Go! - Go, go, go. Huh? Well-played, Cranston. Fly while you can. Soon, every Power Ranger will be where I want them. Much like your Trini. It all happened so fast. That machine that Robo Rita's building, what does it do? Honestly? Something that uses our power made by Rita Repulsa? That's a bad mix. And if we don't put a stop to it, I... I don't think they're gonna make it. Then we gotta destroy her. - "We"? - Yeah. This is Ranger business, not "teenage girl that has homework due" business, okay? Wh... She killed Mom. This is personal. You know how hard... - What you don't understand is... - Let me finish! If Mom could do it, so can I. This is her legacy. I can help. Minh, I'm really sorry, but you can't. You're not a Ranger. Those monsters would overpower you in a second. And we can't risk losing you too. Look, the best thing that you can do for everyone is to stay out of trouble and let us sort this out. Says the guy who caused all this. We all know that if it wasn't for you, my mom would still be here. Oh. That stung, huh? Good. Let's get to Cranston Tech. It has the scanners we need. Let's go. Drip by drip, their delicious Ranger powers ebb away. Let's see how much I've stolen from them. How disappointing. This process is too slow. We need as many Rangers as we can get. I can round the lambs up for slaughter. Not unless we can find them. If we can get them to morph, then it'll be my time to shine. Good thing I know exactly what draws out a Power Ranger. No T-Rex, no Pterodactyl, no Green Dragon Power. Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay. We'll have to scan for something else if we want to find our friends. Thanks, Alpha 9. Oh, greetings, Zack. If the people upstairs only knew they had the world's smartest robot right beneath their feet. Still such a charmer. It's good to see you again. Been a while. I guess life is busy when you're raising a teenager with attitude. Oh, Minh definitely has attitude. Right, Billy? You all good? Yeah. It's just, we haven't been in a mess like this since... Minh's right. It really is all my fault that we lost Trini. Come on, man. You were trying to do something good. Yeah. And look what happened. Finally, a hit. Our system is picking up a powerful presence. Really? Maybe it's him or remnants of him from the Z-Wave. Alpha 8, we've got to converge the particles and draw them in. Initializing Z-Wave energy reconstitution. It's working! Zordon! Zordon, are you here? Ah, Billy, I don't think that's Zordon. - Malfunction. Billy. - Alpha! You have to... - What's happening? - Get back! No, no, no! Yes! After all these years, I'm free! It's time for revenge. No. No, it... it can't be. Fact-check, Billy. You were looking for your precious Zordon, but when he sacrificed himself with the Z-Wave, it wasn't just his particles that spread across the universe. Get it? The evil was purged from my being, and the waves scattered it across space. Until today, when you put me back together, and I found a new body. Now, Rita Repulsa will reign again. I need backup at the Command Center. It's Rita. I'll try to lure her outside, but hurry! Oh, my poor predecessor. Look, let's focus on the now. Robo Rita's a force to be reckoned with. And we gotta make sure she doesn't hurt anybody else. My monster scan has found something. Looks like a live video feed. It's not Rita. It's Putties. And it's not just Angel Grove. It's all over the world! We knew she would return. We're prepared for this. - Alpha 9, it's time. - Yes, sir. Attention all Power Ranger teams. Bandora Protocol initiated. Get to your assigned stations now. If I remember the plan correctly, visitors in three, two, one. One minute, I'm helping out at JJ's junior karate camp, and the next, I'm sneaking off to the bathroom to teleport. Seriously? Bandora Protocol's happening. Robo Rita's back? Come on, guys. Is this really another training exercise? Because, hello, I just heated my lunch. It's not training. Rita is back. - So Tommy, Jason, Kim are fighting her? - No. Unfortunately, they've been captured. So we need your help. "Not a Ranger"? "Not yet," you mean! You'll pay for what you did, Rita. Monsters known as Putty Patrollers haven't been seen in Angel Grove for many years, but today, they're back. Citizens, keep your eyes open for attackers. Reports say this is happening all over the world. Power Rangers, we need you today more than ev... It sounds like you barely got away. And now we have an army of Putties on our hands. What's next? It's likely we'll find ourselves in a Megazord situation soon. Billy and I took months getting the Sabertooth Tiger Zord working without a Yellow Ranger. So Dino Megazord is off the table then without Jace and Kim? Not quite. Alpha and I have been experimenting with secondary connections of the grid. We made these Proxy Power Coins as a contingency. Now all of you can use Dino powers. Whoa. Zordon was very clear. Duplicating active powers is very dangerous. I don't care how dangerous too much pink energy is. Once a Ranger... Always a Ranger. You can definitely count us in. All right. First up, there's been injuries reported already in Angel Grove. We cannot let the Putties run rampant any longer. If that's the case, it's morphin' time! Mastodon! Pterodactyl! Triceratops! Tyrannosaurus! I never get tired of that. Now, go, go, Power Rangers! Run! Help! Hey! You Putties want a fight? You found one. All these years, and they still sound like angry turkeys. Then let's carve 'em up. Finally, my Ranger tracker has got a hit. So somebody's morphed, have they? Are we surprised my Putty bait worked? There's a reason I'm in charge, you fools. Go to the grid fluctuation coordinates and get the Rangers. My masterpiece has a thirst for power, and those do-gooders will quench it. Yes, my queen. Wait, didn't we get Red and Pink? - Different Red. - Different Pink. Same powers. Careful of Snizzard, Rocky. Don't get grabbed. Noted. We'll get you out of here, everybody. Stay calm. Back off! Come on. Run. Everyone, follow me. This way. Well, look what we have here. Something to sink my fangs into. Huh? That's not good. Sweet dreams. - Curses. - Nice rotation on that kick. - You've still got it. - I never lost it. - Time to move. - The civilians here are safe. On to the next fight. Ha! - They slithered away. - Who cares? As long as they're morphed, I can track them. - Seems they went to the park. - A nice place to grab a bite. Oh no. The team's about to find themselves in a monster sandwich. This is a worldwide alert to all Power Rangers. Minotaur is tracking you. As long as you're morphed, he can find you. You must power down. Do you hear me? - Power down, or he'll find you. - Got it. Good work, Alpha. You all heard that, right? Minotaur's tracking us, which means... - Yep. - They followed us here. - Ruin them, Snizzard. - My pleasure. Power down. Untrackable! Rangers, look, look. My new scans picked up activity in a concentrated spot on the lunar surface. Rita's Moon Palace. If she's making herself at home, then our friends and Rita's machine must be there too. What's that? It's an incoming call. We got the Protocol alert. Our ship is zooming to you from the Sirius System. I'm afraid it'll be six hours before we reach your side of the galaxy. Then we'll be in teleport range. Unfortunately, Robo Rita's timing is the worst. It always is. So she got Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy. It's rough, especially for you, Kat. I'm not gonna tell JJ what happened to his father 'cause he'll be home soon. We're going to get Tommy... All of them back today. Right, you've got this. Oh, and Billy, that stealth tech you designed for us, it's a game changer. Thank you. You're very welcome. Being invisible has definitely helped our team's run-ins with the Troobian Empire. Safe travels. Okay? Thanks. And good luck. So, what now? Well, there's still Putties in town. In every town. We can't morph. People aren't safe. - We gotta do something. - Look... Now, we know Rita's on the Moon, right? So why not let's just go there? Crash her party. Snizzard and Minotaur will get in the way. Unless we can draw them out. That's a good thought. I bet you I can develop something that will keep them away from the Moon and keep them away from us. I bet you I can use stealth technology I developed for Adam and Aisha. I bet you can too, Billy. Love that big brain of yours. They're made of metal, right? Maybe we can exploit that. Oh no. Is that... Minh? Minh! Ay, ay, ay! Get out of here. I've got this. Sorry. Am I interrupting? You guys are in for a treat. It's morphin' time! Sabertooth Tiger! Whoa. Messing with this place was a big mistake. Time for Hip Hop Kido. Are you break-dance fighting? Minh. - I wanted to be like Mom. - You deliberately disobeyed me. Let's go. You were right. It's just what we need. The others got back from the youth center. We'll head over and get set up soon. Okay, great. See ya. Awesome place. Who knew Cranston Tech was hiding all this? Not the public and not my employees. This place is secret, so let's, uh, keep it that way. Okay? She's gonna need a talk. Can I help? Thanks. I got this. - The plan needs you. It's urgent. - Agreed. - All right. We'll be back soon. - All right. Pleasure to meet you. - I am... - I'm sorry, Alpha. - Can we have the room? - No problem, Zack. My sensors are detecting a vibe. Come on. Give it to me. If I thought this was gonna get you in trouble, I never would have told you the truth. - But Billy... - What? He insisted. He thought it'd be good for you. Closure and all that. But here we are, in a full-on crisis, and you're trying to play Ranger. What's wrong with that? All of you and Mom did exactly the same thing. I'm just following her example. Isn't that a good thing? What do you think it means to be a Ranger? Kicking butt? Cute quips? Having fun? It's hard. I know. But someone needs to dole out justice on the bad guys. Rita killed Mom. She needs to go down. And I'm ready. I'm happy to do it. Whatever it takes. So why won't that thing let me morph? Minh... What you're feeling, what you want, it's not justice. It's revenge. When I was your age, my mentor told me that only monsters seek revenge. That's what Robo Rita is doing now. She was defeated by the Rangers. Now she wants to even the score and hurt us as much as she can. That's why she... did what she did to Trini. A mission of revenge can never end well. That's not what I want for you. What about what I want? Maybe it's not your call. You wanna be a hero? It's a selfless path. It's not always easy. But I do my best. Setting aside your ambitions can be a good thing. Like me, making sure that you have a good life and a home. It was worth giving up your career in Congress... for me? You are absolutely worth it. And if you can understand that, then you can understand how hard Billy is trying to fix what he set in motion. Zordon sacrificed himself for us long ago. You never met him. He was our mentor but almost a father figure. Billy was trying to bring him back. He didn't know this would happen. I... I didn't know that's how he felt. Just stay here while we execute our plan. Okay? Yeah. And don't worry. We've saved the world before. Now it'll really pack a punch. All right, Kat. Lift her up. So, uh, this thing is used to sort old scrap, huh? Yeah. Well, Minotaur and Snizzard sure fit that definition. All right, we're set. Let's bait the trap. It's morphin' time! Triceratops! - Pterodactyl! - Tyrannosaurus! All right, we're set. They could be here any second, so look sharp. - Hm. - Always do. Every Ranger we capture gives us another boost to the finish line. It's funny. I never believed in their whole teamwork thing, but together, they are more. More power for me, that is. Another three Rangers just morphed in Angel Grove. - Shall we? - Just go, then. Oh, higher power levels than I thought. Bingo. Surprise, Rangers. Oh, right there is perfect. What is this? Like your hairy friend said, a surprise. Thanks. I hate it. Bye now! Ha! - Yes, the trap's holding. - Affirmative. The powerful electromagnetic field will prevent them from teleporting away. Phase one, dusted. Yes! Good job. Wait. Hold up. You're letting them live? That doesn't seem right, does it? What if they get loose? This is the plan. Look, all-out destruction is rarely the most optimal strategy. Now, where are those stealth tech projectors? Sorry. I got lost in the vault again. These are one use only, so be careful. Click here, and it projects a subatomic diffraction field that covers infrared and ultraviolet light. - So we'll be invisible. - Yep. - Ah, love it. - Rita will never see phase two coming. Robot's got jokes. We'll be back soon, and when that happens, I need you to be here. Alpha will keep you company. Hm. - Nice. - Let's make it quick. - Alpha, send us to Rita's lair. - On it. - Ah, that's my foot! - Oops. - Ow. - Sorry. I know I have heavy feet. Better get ready for what's coming. Uncle Zack told me what being a hero means. Guess I'll warm up the volcano. - Mind if I borrow? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Okay. Thanks. Bye. - But... Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! Maybe too much of a flex. Overdone. Hm. Come on! Why won't you fly? Hey! Hey! Help! They're after my boyfriend! That way! - Hero practice won't hurt. - Please! Woo-hoo! Where is he? Move! Move! Yeah! What a mess. Whoa! - George! - Ah! Somebody's lost. Hey, girlie, did you take a wrong turn? You don't remember me from the cemetery? You messed with my people. And your boss killed my mom. We work for an intergalactic war criminal. You'll need to be a lot more specific. I'm Minh Kwan. And you're about to face the Sabertooth Tiger! Wha...? I'm doing the world a favor. Sabertooth Tiger! Now, what do we have here? Another kid playing the hero. I tend to make that difficult. Ask your mom. If I can't morph, then I'll take you down the old-fashioned way. Praying Mantis style. Just like Trini. Tell me, child. Does being squashed like a bug run in the family? Playtime's over. Whoa. Well, it looks like we've got Rita's little science project all to ourselves now. Perhaps. Our distraction might've worked for now, but it's not gonna last long. Oh man. They got a lot more Rangers than I expected. Snizzard is a piece of work. Tommy, look at you. Kat. No. - Snizzard created these snakes. - What does your scanner say? My readings show that their energy is connected to our friends. If we don't destroy that monster, we can't move any of them without causing them harm. - So back to the junkyard or...? - What is that? Oh no. That's what she's been up to. Is that some kind of space barrel? No, it's, uh... it's a space dumpster. Rita's creating a time portal. - That's what she came out of when we... - Yes, when Zordon recruited us. So Rita's trying to contact her younger self. But why? Why? So many reasons. What? Minh! Are you okay? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - Shush. The adults are talking. Have you figured it out, Billy? Or has my genius surpassed even you? Let me guess. A Rita reunion and then some scheme to conquer the galaxy? Not bad. I'll pass through this portal and give years of knowledge to my younger self, making us absolutely unstoppable. We'll kill your do-gooding teenage selves in their sleep before Zordon even thinks to make you Rangers. You think you can rewrite 30 years of history with some tin-pot gadget? Careful. Your friends are charging my machine faster than I could have dreamed, so I don't need you anymore. I'll take out Snizzard. You get the others. You know, your mom will be a first for me, Minh. I've never killed anyone twice before. Hold that thought. Yah! Yes. Stop that. Oh, Cranston. What a waste! Trini died for you. And now you'll share her fate. No! - No! - Minh! Minh! Yes, yes. This brings back memories. Minh? Oh, please, no. What a tragedy. That's what being selfless gets you. Minh, can you hear us? Minh? Hi-ya! Ya! Mom? - I saw... - Oh, thank goodness. No way. What is this? - You know what this means, right? - Go on. You wanna say it? Are you kidding? It's morphin' time! Mastodon! Pterodactyl! Triceratops! Sabertooth Tiger! Tyrannosaurus! Power Rangers! Whoa, it actually worked. - You're a Ranger. - A legit Ranger. Putties, surround them. Time for phase three of the plan. Did we plan a phase three? Let me guess. Phase three is laying the smackdown? Precisely. Bring it. Maybe watching you die will cure my headache. Coming through. Love it. - Kat, you're clear. - Thanks, Rock. Uh, uh, uh. Think twice. You don't want to hurt your tiny little friends. She's right. To free them, we have to destroy Snizzard. Good luck with that. My queen. I don't understand. What did I do? Magic wand, make my monster grow! Oh! Arise, Snizzard! She's distracted. Let's see them try to... That's enough out of her. Boss? No! One problem down. Can you handle that hairy bot? Oh, easy. - Anything I can do? - You're with me. We're going big. Alpha, we need Dinozord power. Now. You got it, Billy. Okay. Transmaterializing Zords to lunar surface in three, two, one. Hold on, Minh. Time for battle mode. Whoa! So how the heck do you drive this thing? Do what I do. - You'll find it's second nature. - Okay. Here he comes. Now, this is the coolest. All right, you big lizard. Come catch these hands. - Direct hit. - Whoo! Don't let up. So you're fighting dirty. Yes! Come on. My club! Rocky, now! - Got him. - I'm not gonna lie, Rocky. That was... pretty hardcore. Well, beef is off the menu. Billy, how's the reptile? As cold-blooded as ever. But we have room for three more in here. Copy that. So it's just me left. Good, I'll have you all to myself. Oh yeah. - I have been looking forward to this. - Together. Shattered circuits can't keep a bad witch down. Heads up. He's still coming. Tails. You lose. They thought they could stop me, but my masterpiece is fully charged. Finally, I can rule with my younger, prettier self. I can't wait to see me again. Can we get this thing on its feet? Is that what I think it is? Oh, great, the portal. We gotta move. System's back online. Just have to... There. Up we go. Mega Power Sword. Now! Now they will come, and then she will be free. My past and my future. It looks like a giant space dumpster. Let's open her up. Yes, yes! And so it begins. What do you think? Time to end this? Oh, definitely. Yeah! My circuits, they burn! Oof! What a way to go. No, my Snizzard. And my snakes. But no matter, the Rita renaissance begins! Ah! After ten thousand years, I'm free! Sit down. Shut up! Huh? Rocky, get the other Rangers. Quick. Right behind you. - Take the shot, Kat. - What? With pleasure. Time to conquer Ea... I'll kill you all! Shut her down. Do it, Zack. This is for Trini. Is that it? Is she gone? Affirmative. It's over. Like I said, Minh, we always save the world. You missed all the action, but I'm glad you made it. All the rescued Rangers are secure in your spaceship's med bay and in stable condition. Well, our course for Aquitar is all set. The Aquitians will fix them up in no time. You sure you don't wanna join us, Billy? You know, uh, Cestria did say she missed you. No. But I'll be there soon. I still have some company matters that I gotta tie up before I can get back to my old adventures. Look at you. You've missed the travel, haven't you? It is nice to have something new to focus on. But once the Aquitians get everyone back to normal size and back in action, all of this will be over. Yeah, it's been a wild ride, but I'm ready to get back to JJ. Being a parent is almost as challenging as being a Ranger. You think that's tough? I didn't even get lunch. - Somebody threw out my noodles. - Sorry, sorry. Relax. Relax. Don't blow a circuit. I'm just kidding. Even though they're small, we shouldn't keep our fellow Rangers waiting. It was great catching up. I'm glad the Sabertooth Tiger legacy is in great hands. It's an honor. Time to fire up the teleporter? - Yeah. - Sounds good. Let's go, Rocky. Inputting all of your coordinates now. Until next time, may the power protect you all. And you. So what do you think of your communicator? Love the vintage aesthetic. And if I'm late for class, teleporting will be clutch. Uh, only if no one's looking, okay? Okay. Look at this place. I mean, it's as if nothing's changed. It's just a little bit... I don't know, smaller, maybe. Maybe we've grown. You two want smoothies? I wanna know if they still have Ernie's recipe. - Sure. - Sure. Can I get you anything while I'm away? A souvenir from Mirinoi, maybe. I don't know. You won't be gone too long, will you? Mom always said she missed you when you were in space. I mean, I'll miss you and... Um... Minh? It's just, before you go, all that stuff... Mom's passing. I said it was your fault, and that wasn't fair. You couldn't have known what would happen to Rita or what would happen to Mom. You didn't say anything about me I haven't told myself a million times. No, but for real. I should be thanking you. If you hadn't pushed Zack to share the truth about Mom... I don't know how I would have handled everything. You're a good kid. We're all looking out for you. And I'm really glad you looked out for me too. You mean Rita's blast? I had to. You're family. Gotta protect your family. Family, huh? Is that why you thought it was okay to borrow my flying car? Okay, that was Ranger business. Ah. I'm sorry. The Radbug is proprietary technology. - You're grounded. - You think you can ground me? No, it doesn't work like that. - You're grounded. - Look at you two. Oh man. She's so much like... Trini would be proud. You just reminded me. After Rita blasted me, I got a weird flash. These memories. Memories? Yeah, from the Morpher. Of you and Mom being Rangers. Being heroes. I mean, it's in optimal condition. Nothing out of the ordinary, but who knows? The morphing grid is a pathway to infinite possibilities. Maybe I shouldn't give up on Zordon. What were the memories like? It was weird. I... It was like I felt how much all of you meant to her. She meant a lot to us too. She was... a great friend. The best. The best. I wouldn't even be here if she didn't overcome her fear of heights and get me out of a really nasty cliffhanger. Mom was afraid of heights? Okay. What else didn't she tell me? That time Shellshock made her run, and she couldn't stop. The weirdo with the traffic light on his back? A traffic-light man? No, it wasn't a man. It was a turtle. A turtle? - We have to tell her everything. - Oh my goodness. It was a turtle. ♪ Down the road, we never know ♪ ♪ What life may have in store ♪ ♪ Winds of change ♪ ♪ Will rearrange our lives More than before ♪ ♪ But you'll never stand alone My friend ♪ ♪ Memories will never die ♪ ♪ In our hearts, they'll always live ♪ ♪ And never say goodbye ♪ ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪ ♪ You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ♪
