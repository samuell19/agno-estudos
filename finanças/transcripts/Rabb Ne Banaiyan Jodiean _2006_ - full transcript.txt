When the daughter's veil slips off her head.. it's her father who loses his honour Who can explain you that? You don't even have your mother Don't say that, daddy I understand that, but I didn't dance deliberately It was the music, the magic of Jehli's song..

How could you stoop so low to think.. that I'd marry my son off to my servant's daughter? Must commend your scheme Everyone is greedy for money But, to rid yourself of poverty did you find only my family, wretch? Didn't you find another to play with? Enough, Sardar-ji Please do not abuse my true love anymore God knows that, your son's music made home within me And I made the mistake of falling in love with him But if you think I fell in love with him for your money.. then let me give you a suggestion.

The vermin wanted to reach the skies I showed the wretch where she belongs, I buried her It's in your best of interests to forget her Who are you to decide about my love? As for setting me and Beeba apart, you can't separate sugar from milk. Or, you'd be successful in your evil ploys Watch your tongue, Jehli Or, I might stop counting you amongst my children Whatever I've done, I did it to uphold the honour, status and reputation of this family No dad, no You did nothing but stifle your son's desires A father who ruins his son's happiness can't be granted a grandson My bhabhi is barren, not her fault It's your lowly mind that is at fault Like the walls of this house, it has never heard the cries of my heart Why did you drop the sword? Come on, strike me. Why don't you kill me? I'm helpless! The Guru has forbidden us from killing an unarmed enemy Enemy? Yes, enemy! No better name for my father! I disown you We're dead for each other Jehli, stop Don't you dare From now on, I have no relations with him And Jehli walked out of the house I tried my best to stop him, but he refused He's wandering, looking for Beeba We looked for her everywhere But we never found Beeba, nor did Jehli find peace No knowing where he is suffering right now As for me, As for me, As for me, my days just pass..

Brother Jehli, how are you? How are you? - Brother, I got to know much later about what you endured Bhabhi told me. It hurt me a lot You and your sweetheart were set apart I looked for her everywhere. No knowing where the hell she's been hidden But by God, I'll certainly find her Sadly my father has turned my foe Every thing in this world seems useless Death doesn't come, and life is miserable I'm just smoking my desires Do not lose hope Everything will be all right.

You'd never even go against my word What's this you are telling me? You are certainly under the influence of that wretched woman. Bitch Slut! Barren Don't call me barren, daddy I respect you a lot But ever since I married and came into this family.. you have been calling me slut and barren It's perhaps the abuses from.. ..your heart that has fallen on my womb like a curse I don't have a baby, but I never considered myself childless I've reared Deep like my son. I consider him my son And I have loved Jehli as I would love my kid brother How am I barren? I'm not barren, daddy. You are the one who is childless Despite having three sons, you could never love even one like a father I see. So the dumb have also started speaking in this house? Yes, they will.

What happened? - Deep met with an accident What happened to bhabhi? Dad hit her, her head banged against a table Forgive me, brother I could neither save your love nor Deep's I couldn't even help when you were being thrown out I have raised Deep like my own son Today he is being forced to marry When I tried to stop it, I got rewarded A mother has lost Your bhabhi has lost No bhabhi, a mother never loses A mother's love is the greatest truth of life I can't let this truth lose. I won't let the wedding happen Never Stop him Priest, marriages are made in heaven But you seem to take the reins in your own hands Enough! I've respected you enough, I've tolerated you enough And in doing so, I have sacrificed a lot of happiness You think I'm God? I can't take your atrocities lying down I'm your father, I sired you. How dare you rebel against me? Yes, I have turned a rebel You've rebelled against God, Who creates relationships How dare you try to break them? - Deep is my son I have all the rights to his life. You have walked out of the house What's your problem? - It hurts me a lot.. when God's plan is obstructed. Deep is my kid brother If you try to ruin his happiness, don't expect me to be in my limits Guru Gobind Singh said, "When the arrow strikes, it causes agitation" What are you waiting for?

He's my grandson My heart says, my blood runs in his veins Really? A great Sardar has such a feeble heart? You ought to be happy He's your son's, your enemy's, son Don't, Grewal He's the only hope of my family I beg of you, don't kill him All right, Sardar.

Clean them Arrest him We've been keeping an eye on you After all those crimes under cover, we've now caught you redhanded You are arrested on charges of attempted murder Who informed the cops? I did.

It's the game of life You've accepted the relationships created by God, it's enough for me Come, my son What about K.B Singh?
