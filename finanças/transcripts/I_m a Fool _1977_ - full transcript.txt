(light piano music) (Burt sings "Deep River") - Oh, feedin' time. - Yeah. Boy! How'd you talk your way into this job? Mr. Jessup, you needed a fella to help you out. - Didn't need no city boy. You don't know nothing about horses. - I figure I know as much as a body is likely to know. And if there's more, I'll learn that too. Uh, if you'll teach me Mr. Jessup. - Don't go callin' me Mr. nothing. The name's Burt. Well don't just stand there, unhitch him so he can eat. And remember, I'm not you boss. Mr. Harry Whitehead is. Now, if these horses win a race now and then, we can stay working for Mr. Whitehead. OK? - Yes sir. - Don't sir me, boy. It's the horses you've got to respect. When it's raining, they come in first. If it's cold, the get the blankets. And when you're tired and hungry, they eat first and sleep first. Now, you think that's any kind of life for a man? - Yes sir. - Yeah, we'll see, boy. We'll see. (light guitar music) - [Andy] It was the summer of 1919. I left my hometown of Canton, Ohio. Left my mother and sister cryin' on the front porch sayin' it was something awful. One of our family working as a swipe on the race horse circuit, traveling with a colored man and all. Can't say I saw nothing wrong with it. And I feel sorry for the boys that go through life putting on airs and never get to know a man like Burt Jessup. From July until late November, Burt and me kept moving along to race meets and fairs all through Ohio. We'd get to a county seat town on a Saturday or Sunday and the fair'd begin the next Tuesday and last until Friday afternoon. My horse was Dr. Fritz and he'd be sayin' the 225 trot on Tuesday afternoon. And on Thursday afternoon, Bucephalus, Burt's charge, would show them a thing or two in the free-for-all pace. It left you a lot of time to hang around and you'd find out about horses and men and pick up a lot of stuff you could use all the rest of your life if you had some sense and salted it down. (singing) * I saw Nelly in the crowd * In the crowd * I saw Nelly in the crowd * And I shouted right out loud * Saying Nelly it's your (mumbling) * - Easy boy. Don't ever use the same old piece of bacon. Boy, he'll get so mad at you, spit that bit right out at you (gurgling sound). - Burt, don't talk no more about it. (Burt laughs) - Got to learn to hold your liquor Andy. - (mumbling) Burt. (Burt laughs) One day, Burt and I hitched up Dr. Fritz and Bucephalus and we were heading out to the races at Marrieta, Ohio. We were driving slow and steady so as not to overheat the horses and Burt was inging his favorite song, "Deep River." (Burt sings "Deep River") - Turn there Andy. - What business we got here? - Pull in boy, you don't know everything yet. My old friend George you used to tend stables for Mr. Mathers. Been a long time since I've seen him. - [Andy] This is some place. - [Burt] Yeah. (groaning) (belching) - Ain't nobody around today. When we finish this, I'm gonna show you how that big old horse can really run. Why'd they go have to name a beautiful beast like you a crazy name like About Ben Ahem? I call him Big Ben. He can go though. He's sort of lays back in the in the early heat and then picks up sharp and dusts them down clean. (laughing) - One day, I'm gonna drink all the wine I want. And I'm gonna put on my best suit, cut the two wide open. Have 15 pretty women following me up and down the street. (laughing) - Andy, you've never been with a woman, have you? I mean, up to the hilt. - No, I suppose not. It doesn't show, does it? - Well, not unless you're lookin' real close. (laughing) - You figure there's something wrong with me? (laughing) I wanted to go with a woman lots of times, but every time it's the same old thing, can't get up the nerve. - You've just got to relax and be yourself. - I sure have thought about going off to one of those houses. But I don't want some cheap and mean-looking. - Yeah, I know what you want, you want a princess. - How'd you know that? (laughing) - [George] You white boys are all alike. (laughing) - I want her to be shy. Tell me things she never told anybody else before. And I want to be the strong one and for her to be the timid, shrinking one. - You know what I got to say that? - What? - Good luck. (laughing) (cackling) - [Burt] Woo! - Easy boy, easy now. Easy. Ho, ho, ho now. Come on Burt, see how he feels. (Burt groans) - Oh, come on Burt. - Come on. - What are you waiting for? Here's your chance. Come on. Come on. - Easy boy, easy now. (laughing) Easy boy, easy now. Ho boy, ho. Easy now. - Ya! Ya boy. - He looks good, don't he? - Really. - Come on Burt. (Burt cackles and yells) - Low liquors and fast horses are just too much for some men. - He'll be all right by morning. He just got excited by the racing and all. Old Burt could have been the greatest. You know that George. - You old rascal you (laughing). (lighthearted music) (Burt groans) - Hey, you goin' someplace special? - Burt? You think you could tend things without me today? I wanna walk around, see this place. Might even by myself a grandstand ticket and sit with all the dudes. - Look for some women, that it? - Do I look all right? - Nope, come here. You know what you need to look like a real swell? A derby, a brand new derby. ("If you're happy and you know it" instrumental) - How much are those? - 10 cents. - I'll take two. - [Voiceover] I've seen jockeys lash their horses until the flesh tore like Irish leather. They literally whacked at the beast until blood streamed across the (muffled). And the women were there. You'd think they'd shriek or shield their eyes, right? No indeed. One of our most celebrated dealers, you'd all know her name (muffled). I often accompany her in her races in Europe. Her passion are literally unbounded (muffled by laughter). - Bartender? Hey bartender, I'd like to have-- - Hold on, just hold on a second. - I'd like mine now, please before the races begin. I'll have a whiskey. And no water. - Beg pardon young fella, may I trouble you for a light? Havana, rum-soaked tip. The only kind to smoke, you agree? Much obliged old chap. - Bartender, another whiskey. A double. I'll have four 25 cent cigars. Havana's rum-soaked tips. (lighthearted music) - 15 seconds to post time. The horses are in position for the start of the first race. Go! (crowd cheers) - Excuse me, hope I'm not being too forward but if you're thinking about placing another bet you outta take a lot at a horse named About Ben Ahem. - About Ben Ahem? Have you bet on him before? - Well, wouldn't be fair if I said right now, but I can tell you he's got a mark of two-oh-eight and he'll come in well under that. - Are you sure? - I'm positive. But don't bet a penny on his first heat because he'll run it like a plow horse. After that, he'll skin 'em alive. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Don't mention it. - My name's Henry Wessen. This is my fiance Miss Elinor Woodbury and my sister, Lucy Wessen. - How do you do? - I'm Walter L. Mathers Jr., of Marietta, Ohio. My family this place down on the Ohio River. A big old house. Kind of stuffy for some tastes maybe, but we have the most beautiful stables you've ever seen. Henry, would you like a cigar? - Ah, thank you Walter. Don't mind if I do. - What brings you to Sandusky, Mr. Mathers? - What brings me? Well actually, you see, my father owns this horse, About Ben Ahem, which he lets out to a Mr. Bob French for racing purposes. You see, being Presbyterian, our family has never gone into racing in that way. In our own name, I mean. Well, my father thinks that this Bob French may not be on the square, so he sent me up to Sandusky on the sly. - You mean you're a spy? How exciting. Isn't that exciting Lucy? - Henry, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind placing this for me on About Ben Ahem for the third heat. I wouldn't want this Bob French fella to spot me checking on him. For whatever odds you can get. Henry, not until the third heat, Henry - Well Henry, after what Mr. Mathers told us, Elinor and I'd be missing out on a golden opportunity if we didn't each put something in. - That's right Henry. We all want to be millionaires. - 10 dollars enough? (upbeat orchestral music) - Well, he ran just as you said he would, Mr. Mathers. - Oh, please call me Walter. Well, it's this next heat, he'll come on sharp. Odds should be pretty good now. I'll add this to my bet, Henry. - Fine Walter. (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) (cheering) - We all went out for a champagne dinner at some fancy restaurant and then Wilbur said we'd rent a boat and visit the amusement park near Cedar Lake. She was from a town called Tiffin. Wasn't too far from Lake Eerie. We about laughed and cried and looked at each other all serious and such till I knew I was falling in love about as hard as a body can and still keep breathing. A fella can tell when something's for real, all right. And this was it. This must be my lucky day. I could tell that as soon as I saw you in that grandstand. But this sure is a nice place. Reminds me of a fihing hole near home. I caught this big ol' catfish one time. He was about that... He... - Would you like to know what I was thinkin' before? I was wishin' that I didn't have to catch the train to Tiffin tonight. - Yeah. - Is it very far to Marietta, Walter? - Marietta? - To your farm from Tiffin? - Marietta, yeah, right. I forgot I told you about our farm in Marietta. Lucy, there's something that I really, I really should try and tell you. Lucy, I wish that. Well, you see, I wish... - Yes, Walter? - I wish that... That today never had to end. - Walter, are we going to see each other again? - Yes. - We could exchange addresses. - Addresses? - Sure, so we can write to each other. And maybe you could visit me if you felt like it. - Yeah, I'd, uh, I 'd like that. - And I could visit you in Marietta on you farm? - [Elinor] Lucy, time to go. - We have to catch the train now. Walter, was there something you wanted to say? - Lucy. (dramatic, woeful music) - [Elinor] We made it. I thought for sure we'd be late. - Yeah. Well, goodbye Walter. Thanks for the tip on that horse. - Goodbye Walter, it was nice meeting you. - [Henry] Hey, let's sit near the back of the car. - Walter, you won't forget to write, will you? Oh, but I'll write to you first. As soon as I get home tonight, before I even unpack. Mr. Walter L. Mathers Jr., Windy Acres Farm, Marietta, Ohio. Then I can go to sleep, make sure I dream about you. - [Voiceover] All aboard! (train whistles) (dramatic music) - Now that's the kind of girl you see just once in your life. And if you don't make hay, then she's gone. She gives you a look from inside her somewhere and it ain't no vampin'. What it means is you want that girl to be your wife and you want nice things around her like flowers and swell clothes and you want her to have your kids. And you want good music played. No ragtime. I coulda run after that train and made About Ben Ahem look like he was tied to a plow. Maybe she'd write me down at Marietta and the letter would come back, stamped on the front, there ain't any such guy. (whistling) I bet if I wouldn't have drank all that whiskey or got mad at that dude with the fancy tie I would have never have gone and told such a lie. I wish that dude was here right now I'd take his cane and I'd smash him one. - Oh, nah, nah, Andy. You stop being so hard on yourself. All you did was to tell some little girl a lie. - [Andy] Not just any girl. - All right, say you told the truth from the beginning. You a swipe sleeping on a cot in a barn. - Would have made no difference to her. Not to Lucy Wessen. I could tell by the way she looked at me. A fella can tell those things. It don't take a whole lot of learnin'. I'm a fool. (Burt sings "Deep River")
