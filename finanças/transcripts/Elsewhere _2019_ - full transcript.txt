[piano music plays] [replaces lid] [everyone] Surprise! Happy birthday, son! Honey! ♪ There's the birthday boy! Oh, hi Mark. Just wipe your shoes if you could, thank you. I got a serious problem. The toilet is totally clogged. What do you want me to do about it? Well, it is completely clogged to no repair. My birthday party is the reason that it's clogged. Did you have anything to do with this? [ding] Excuse me. May I uh, may I please have everyone's attention? We're gathered here today to honor the life of Bruno, my son. Who, for those of you who don't know, was recently commissioned by the city council to design our new fire house. [clapping] But it's a rather bittersweet celebration in that we also honor the memory of his beloved wife, Lydia. And, uh, I've written a few words. Oh, for fuck sake. It's a bit of a poem. Lydia was your name, and Lydia my son loved. Doesn't rhyme. Now Lydia is gone and the vast, empty spaces she has left in our hearts and faces will ever be filled. To my brave son, who's spirit is the spirit of a titan. Who is loyal to his wife like a dog. You, my son, have been a true hero and you make us proud. Happy birthday, Bruno. [slow applause] [door opens] Hi, Bruno. Oh, hey. How're you doin'? Good. Yeah. Yeah, good. Oh, knocked 'em over. Sorry. Mr. Black. Wow, hi. Long time, no see. Yeah. Doin' alright? Yeah, I'm... hangin' in there. You wanna come in? No, that won't be necessary. So, listen Bruno, I'm- I'm afraid I've got a bit of bad news. Ok. Uh, now look, you know I- I like you, right? In spite of all the... the rocky times, I know you're a good guy deep down. But when I first offered this piece of land to my daughter there was a mutual understanding it was for her to live on, and you later came into the picture and as much as my wife protested I was glad when you built this home together as a couple. But Lydia's... Lydia's been gone for two years now and, well, I'm afraid we've decided to take the property back. Excuse me? I'm very sorry. You- no, you- you can't take it back, it's... my house. You see, that's the thing. Technically it is not. It's-- it's sitting on my property. You- you- you gave this to Lydia. I designed and- and built that house. Every beam, every cabinet, even the bathroom tiles. It was- it was all us. Do you ever wonder who paid for all those beams and tiles? That is my house. The way things stand right now it's a done deal. It's not. There's a will. We both know that is not true. No, there's a will. Lydia- Lydia, she told me, she said- Bruno, this is not your house. We've let you stay here for several and now it's time to go. You have two weeks to vacate the premises. And it would be great if we could do this amicably, I mean it. Let's just do this the easy way, shall we? Dude, how can you lose a will? I didn't lose it! I hid it. I didn't want it laying around where I could- it was ominous. Dark matter. Nobody was supposed to die. How about you buy it from the bastard? Felix, it's my own fucking house. Not if you can't find that will. I'm completely fucked. No, you're not. There's gotta be a way out of this. No, we'll come up with a plan. You gotta change that tune, my friend, 'cause you can't dance to shitty music and it is time to dance. We'll come up with a plan 'cause I'll tell you right now, they'll take that house over my dead body. [knocking loudly] Please step out of the house now, Bruno. Come on. You're- you're officially trespassing now. Yeah, well you can set this place on fire, I'm still not comin' out. I think it's better if we do step out. ♪ Every time the telephone rings, I hold my breath, ♪ ♪ Hoping that it's you, I'm scared to death, ♪ ♪ Phone went ring, ♪ ♪ My crippled heart cried, ♪ ♪ Let it be you on the line, ♪ ♪ Then a voice said hello, ♪ ♪ Can I speak to Joe, ♪ ♪ Wrong number, ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, goodbye ♪ ♪ Pity the fool ♪ ♪ who loves you so, ♪ ♪ If you found someone new, ♪ ♪ Don't let me know, ♪ I'm six foot six so it was probably a grizzly.

Looking good. ♪ 'Til I tell these blues goodbye ♪ There you go. Son. I got three words for ya. Welcome home... son. I'm going in the shed. I said it wasn't up for discussion. Why would you wanna sleep in the shed? The boy needs independence, honey. He'll freeze to death. Mom, it's the middle of summer. We'll give him the electric blanket. And how am I supposed to keep warm? You haven't used that blanket for years. Nobody is taking your electric blanket. Take the blanket, bro, you deserve it. Ha ha. Our pantry's finest. There's hardly anything to celebrate, dad. Oh, I beg to differ, son. I beg to differ. Really, why don't you save it for a special occasion? [pop] Boom! [laughs] We're saying grace. Uh, can you leave me out of it? This is our home and we say grace. Honey, not tonight. The boy doesn't like it. It's not a matter of liking, it's a matter of faith. It's fine. I just- I won't join in. Felix, I think it's only fair, don't you? Don't get him involved, the man is high as a kite. Linda, let me tell you something. It would be joyous. Thank you, Felix. Hands please. Mmmhmm. Dear Lord, we thank you dearly for this special night as we gather as a family to support Bruno, whom we love, cherish, and adore. As you know, dear Lord, Bruno lost his wife two years ago and he hasn't seen the light since. Also, he's now homeless. We beseech you, oh Lord, to guide his path towards a better life and towards a better woman. As we discussed previously, dear Lord, Dora Maloney's daughter, Rita- You gotta be kidding me. Has just been through a painful divorce and we ask you to help her through it, and also to clear the way for Bruno to date her. Honey, honey. I think that's a bit specific. Let Bruno find his own path. His own path isn't working, is it? We're gonna help him get through this! I'll sell this house if I have to, buy another Winnebago. We are not moving into a Winnebago! Nobody is moving into a Winnebago. Says the man living in a shed. I'll be right back. Where are you going? You haven't touched any food. I made your favorite. Don't pressure him so much. The man is morose. [grunting] Watch your back, son. You're going back to your old house, aren't you? You're gonna get yourself shot. It's not your home anymore. Hold on, I'll go get you a can of gasoline. Don't enable him, John. You can't just hang out at your place anymore. That's trespassing, man. I'm not about to let my house rot into the ground. Dude, it's been three weeks. The place isn't just gonna fall apart. It's basic maintenance, that's all. Dude, focus, ok? Yes, I say we go fix the leak and we get outta there. You can't just fuck around with rich people like this. Sure you can. [announcement] Gus, line four. Gus, pick up line four. What the fuck is that? Take a deep breath. Bruno? Bruno? What is that? Ok, I have a bad feeling now. Let's just turn around and go. Bruno? Dude! Dude, please! Come on, Bruno! Listen to me! Who the fuck is that? Maybe she's the new cleaning lady. Who the fuck is that? Breathe with me, bro. Don't do anything rash. Dude! Dude! Dude! Dude! [knocking] Bruno! Bruno! Yeah! Hello. Uh, what're you doing? I'm sorry? I mean, what're you doing here? I'm moving in. And you- and you are? Moving in? Yeah. What do you- what do you mean by uh, moving in? I'm sorry, who are you? Friend? Friend. Friend. A friend of the family. Oh, so like you know the former owners? Yeah, yeah. I just dealt with a management company so I didn't really get to know them. A management company, yeah. Just uh... Dude. Gotta go, buddy. So, you're like neighbors? Yeah. A neighbor. But I live in town, but uh, I- I wanted to come by and just... say hi. Well, hi. I have to go. I have to go. Ok, well thanks for stopping by. Ok. Ok. Nice meeting you guys! Pleasure meeting you. Sorry, I didn't get your names. Don't worry about it. Get on. What were you thinking? What the hell are we doing here? Just wait here. Dude, don't do anything rash. [knocking] Hello? Hello? [distant conversation] [party chatter] You always thought that. Well, I do. [chatter and laughter] Oh, Jesus Christ. Bruno. What're you doing here? You sold my house, you son of a bitch. I think this is hardly the time or the place. Well, right now is exactly the time and the place that somebody is moving into my fucking house! You should keep your voice down. You had no right. You sold my house and you had no right to do that. I decided to take the property back and I did. I don't see there's a problem with that. You don't see a problem? You don't see a problem in making me vacate my own home and having somebody move into there three weeks later? That house belongs to me more than it ever belonged to you. It's just pocket change for you, always has been. Do you understand what that house means to me? It's my life. It's Lydia, your daughter. It's my house! It was never your house. We owe you no explanations. Now, please leave. You just wanted me out, didn't you? You didn't care about the property, it never mattered to you. You just didn't want me living there anymore. What you took from us was far more valuable than a rotting shack. You are the reason I lost my daughter. You are the reason that she wanted to live in that godforsaken hut like a hobo. You were the reason that she refused treatment. Lydia did what she wanted to do. It was her right. I just stood by her and we both wished that you would have had the courage to do the same. You know, in eight years of living with Lydia I never quite understood the distain she had for you, but I guess she had a point. It's over, Bruno. Enjoy your dinner. What a despicable man. [chatter continues] Oh, no fucking way. Have you lost your mind? Son of a bitch is gonna pay. What the hell are you doing? Start the Vespa. Let's just regroup- Felix, this thing is heavy! What has got into you, man? This is not cool, dude. Not cool, man. Let's go, come on. This fucker's like 100. Did you have avenues we can explore? Come on! I'm coming! Fucking fuck. Woo hoo! [laughing] Yeah! Who the hell is that? That's my cousin, bro. That's your cousin? Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'. I didn't even know I had a cousin. He's a personal injury lawyer, Felix. We got nothing to lose, bro. We go in, get some advice, and proceed. Legally. Well, well, well, Bruno. What a nice surprise. What brings you to your place of work? Morning, Frank. I haven't seen you here in days. I was beginning to wonder whether you still worked for me. Ah. So, how's this fire house thing coming along? Oh, it's um... Time's running out, Bruno. I- I guarantee that it'll be- And you. What're you doing here? Why are you always hanging out in this office? Look, Frank, I need an extension. Bruno, you ran out of favors months ago, and at this point you're this close to running out of a job, too. You come in and out of here like it's your country club. You're hung over half the time, and the receptionist tells me you keep stealing people's food out of the fridge. You're the most talented kid this place has ever seen, but you're the most unreliable worker I've ever run across in my entire life and I'm 180 years old! Finish that design. Are you even listening to me? Huh? Get to work. Hang on a second. What did that woman want? She was looking for contractors. What did you tell her? I gave her some numbers. Did Frank bring up the fridge situation? It's not like people don't know it's you. This isn't preschool, you know! Hey! Hi. Hi. Oh. You remember me from- Yeah, right. Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself. I- I was uh... I'm Bruno. Bruno, I'm Marie. Nice to meet you. You too. Again. So you found the town, what're you up to? Uh, I'm just running some errands. Actually I'm shopping for a contractor, which is really tough around here. Oh, a contractor. Yeah. What for? Uh, the place is a little stale. I'm just looking to do a little bit of work. A little- little bit of work? Uh, what- what- is that what you're doing? Yeah. Re-do the kitchen, change the bathroom tile, just bring the place back to life. You wouldn't happen to know of a contractor in town, would you? I mean, I've gotten some quotes but the prices are ridiculous. You know, depending on the work you're- you're planning to do, I'm a contractor myself. I could do the work myself. Make sure it's uh, up to standard. Yeah, I'd be happy to work within your budget, if you're interested. Uh, ok. Do you wanna give me a quote first? Oh, uh, it doesn't- doesn't matter. I'm familiar with the premises. I just want to make sure the work is um, up to standard. Sure, uh, I don't know... I'm the only one you're gonna find on the cheap, you know. You can call them and ask them, but local contractors? They're very few and uh, very expensive, you know? Uh, you just give me your budget and we'll take it from there. Uh, when could you start? How about tomorrow? Alright, see you there. What're you doing? If anyone's gonna touch that house it's gonna be me. I can't wait to get my hands on that bathroom. It's like walking into a morgue every time I brush my teeth. I'm thinking of a soft yellow for the kitchen. Soft yellow? Fuck no. Excuse me? Ok, just lay down the drop cloth, um, prime the bedroom. Prime the bedroom! I'm ready for you to turn that thing off. Ok, where are we? We are on our property. And what is that magnificent tool you are holding? Oh, oh, this? Oh, this would be a- a shovel. Why? Because we are about to break ground on our new house. I'm- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that. What did you say? Are you serious? Say that again. You're serious. Ok, um, we are - ahem - about to break ground on our new home. Oh my god. Alright. Ok. One, two- Yeah. Three. Go! It's hard! Get into that. Go, go, go! You did it! We did it. We did it. We did it. Oh. Hey, turn that off. Why? Come on, just put it down. Why? Because I want you. I want you, right here. Are you ok? Yeah, I'm... hot. I... I- Can I get you some water? I just need- need a minute. I have to go. What do you mean? Uh, it's- it's an emergency. I um, I'm really sorry. Uh... I'll explain later but I have to go. Is everything ok? Yeah, yeah. I'll be in touch. So you say you've been living in this house for how long? Se- seven years. So there was never any actual document or will that would put the actual property in your actual name? There- there- there is, yeah. No, there- there was. Uh, my wife, she left a will, but I can't find it. You lost the will? No, no. I- I didn't lose it, I... it just hasn't turned up yet. Look, I gotta be honest. Without the will this is a very tough case. I mean, the house is yours but there's no real legal proof here. I mean, the will would really help the case. Yeah, I just can't find it. Well, I guess we could give it a shot. So you think there's a chance? A chance that we can fight this? Sure there is. If you can prove that the house was gifted to you and your wife and that there was a tacit agreement that it would belong to you if she would, say, you know... die, well then yeah, there's a chance. But it's gonna take work, it's gonna take muscle, and it's gonna take time and muscle- Yeah, I don't care. Let's- let's do it. Let's um... what's the next step? What... Ok, you should gather everything that would attest to the longevity of your relationship, the depth of your relationship. You know, if you have any photos or videos, anything would help. Then we'll put the case together and then, of course, there's the certain matter of the uh... retainer. How- how much is that for family, Cuco? How much you got? I mean, my answer's nothing. Would you be interested in a classic Vespa? What color? Hey, hey, hey. No, no. No way, no way. We can't let go of this opportunity. It's not even an option. This is important. If we don't get this started you'll be missing out on your only chance to get your house back. Now, if you really care about our friendship you'll let me do this for you, brother. God knows I don't wanna hear you bitch about this for the rest of our lives. Vespa's yours. Cool. Deal? [barking] [yelps] Benjamin! Benjamin D. Mendez! I just peed myself a little. Oh, buddy. Sorry about that. Uh, do you have a towel? John! Will you do me a favor get off of that roof right this minute! [loud drilling] There's no need to yell like that, you know. See? Now you woke him up. Leave me be. You're making me nervous. He doesn't need a TV. What're you doing, dad? He's hooking up the direct television. If he's gonna live in the shed he'll have a TV in the shed. I- I don't want a TV. He dug up an old one from the garage. [phone ringing] Hello? Bruno, it's- it's Marie. Hello? Bruno? Marie, Marie. [thumping] Hi, Marie. Hi. Is everything ok? Yeah, yeah. Uh, better. Better. Uh, just a family situation. Very sad and unexpected. [muffled yelling] I'm really sorry to hear that. Ok, but look, I was- I was uh, wondering if you're coming in today? [drilling] Uh... [thumping] I was just wondering if you could maybe recommend someone else? [drilling] I- I want to get started right away because I'm gutting the kitchen. You're gutting the kitchen? Shit! [smash] What the hell is the matter with you?! Well, then you get up here and help me. Oh, stop it. What're you doing down there? How old are you? Hey. Ah. Hey, I want to radically transform this kitchen. Gonna rip down the cabinets, we're gonna lose this wallpaper. Can we start somewhere else? Why? Uh, I'd rather just not start in the kitchen. Why not? I'm superstitious, uh, about starting in kitchens. It's a thing. You are the strangest contractor I've ever met. How about we start in the bathroom? How would that make you feel, emotionally? Sure. Good, 'cause the toilet's clogged. [flushes toilet] [flushes toilet] Oh my god, it works! Yes! I swear I tried everything with a skull on it. What did you do? What was wrong with it? It was the septic pipe out in the back. It was pretty clogged so I took care of it. Great. So the tiling situation, I was thinking about, like a- something positive like a sky blue, you know, it's such a gloomy bathroom. I kinda like it. Well, I don't. So, ok. I was thinking something like... something like this. Hey, that's not the tile we picked out yesterday. No, I went back and changed them. Do you have a problem with that? I just... Seriously, I've never met such an opinionated contractor. If I had wanted an interior decorator I would have hired one. Do you want this job or not? I just think it's gonna look weird. Ok. How about you tile it up, finish the job, and then we'll see how we feel? How does that sound? Sure.

Oh, look at this big shot architect. We were just talking about you. I hear you're designing our new fire hall. You're a winner. If you say so. Oh, I do say so. You're a big shot architect. Yeah. Listen, what're you doing tonight? Actually, I uh- Nothing, Dora. The man does nothing. He sits and mopes in that shed like his life is over. You have to get out of your cocoon. Why don't you hang out with my daughter, Rita, tonight? Well, I just- Oh, you'll get along swimmingly. You used to play together. That was a long time ago Take her bowling. She's depressed, you're depressed, it makes perfect sense. Eight o'clock, pick her up. I- I really can't, I- No, I will not take no for an answer. I'm getting upset and I have a heart condition. You wanna see me drop dead? Is that it? Eight o'clock sharp. Go take a shower. You look like you've been shot at. And hit! I'm working two jobs at the moment, so I just got my nursing degree which is great, but I also have three more weeks left at the market and the hours at the hospital are... it's hard. The hours are really bad. Hey, I like your shirt. Did you get it at a- at a thrift shop? No, it's my dad's. Oh. He must have been a real- a disco flyer, your dad. Uh, so you're divorced, yeah? Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you. So your wife died. Yep. Do you wanna tell me about it? No. No, of course not. Sorry. Ok, you know what? We can- Bruno? Hmm? Bruno. I was just gonna say um, probably not gonna work out so why don't we just go ahead and call it a night? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. Ok. Hey, how would you feel about getting a cab home? Excuse me? Yeah, uh, I thought I'd just hang around for a bit and... You really are an asshole, aren't you? Hey. May I? Please, go ahead. What happened to your girlfriend? Uh, she's- she's not my girlfriend. She had to go. She's very pretty. She's just a friend. Young. Looked like you were having fun. Uh, my mother and her mother have been going on about her divorce for months. We were coerced into a date. She took a cab home. Wait, you brought her here and then sent her back in a cab? I didn't send her back, she just- she just took one. That- that's bad, isn't it? And you're still here? Are you kidding? Oh, holy fuck, my mom. This is gonna be an ordeal. Uh, is your mom concerned about your love life? My mother is concerned about my life, period. Driving, uh, there's my hairstyle, my diet. A fixation with nutrition. My mom was just like that. Right? Yeah. Jesus Christ. I went over there for breakfast the other day and there was an actual family crisis, I'm talking meltdown, because I wouldn't eat my grapefruit. I'm 45 years old, ok? "Eat your grapefruit, you're low on phosphorus". Apparently I'm dying. Every day I learn I'm low on something new. That's so beautiful. She loves you so much. Where do you get phosphorus? Grapefruit, of course. Wow. Look at you. You actually talk. Cheers to this conversation, and knowing that phosphorus is in grapefruit. We hope. So you always go out on your own? I like going out alone. I travelled a lot in my '20s. Plus, it's not like I know anybody here. That doesn't bother you? That was the point. I guess I was looking for a kind of- a refuge. A refuge? From what? You are opening up a can of worms, my friend. I don't know if you wanna go there. I like worms. I love fishing. Well, I was with a man for five years and uh... I was a great step-mom to his beautiful twin girls and one day he announced that he was uh, leaving me to be with his family. He went to give another shot with his ex-wife and uh, so he moved back in with his kids. So I- I moved back to Seattle and took a trip out here and saw this house and fell in love with it. I'm also here to write a book and uh, this is the perfect place for it. You're uh, you're writing a book? What- what about? What's the book about? Moss. Moss? Moss. Yeah. I'm fascinated by moss. It's my second book, actually. That is so cool. I've never actually thought about moss. Well, big mistake. They- they've been here for a really long time. Longer than any other land plant, and they've- they've figured out a lot about how to be here on this earth. Like- like what? Like how to live within their own means. They live in these tiny little layers of rocks and fallen trees where other dominant plants can't live and they just thrive, instead of colonizing nature with grandeur and size like humans do. They've just gracefully accepted that they're bad competitors, and I love it because by doing that they challenge the whole idea that competition is the best way to survive because you know how long these bad competitors have been around? 350 million years. And I just think that that's amazing, that such a humble little thing can persist like that. They're like a whole other universe within the forest and they're just this tall. Jesus. Jesus liked moss. [laughs] I think he used it as a pillow. Wow, I uh, guess I should consider myself lucky for not making it home in a cab. Yeah, I feel terrible about that, actually. Make sure you apologize. Will do. I had a really nice time with you tonight. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I'll see you tomorrow. I like your shirt. I will not keep stolen goods in my garage. It's not stolen, I- I got it through a friend. What, do you think I'm stupid? I know this horse belongs to Lydia's parents. Nancy used to show it to us every time we went over there. They shipped it from Mongolia Well, guess what, mom? It's yours now. Bruno, I want this horse back in their home by the end of the day. The woman took his house from him. Let him keep it. It was a stupid impulse, ok mom? They had just insulted me so I- I took it. But I hardly feel the need to apologize. These- these people, they're- they're sick. They despise my entire existence and you wanna know why? Coincidentally because I didn't grow up in a house full of golden freaking horses, and it pains them every day to know that their daughter married a nobody. Well, this time they don't get to win. So you can dump it or you can take it back yourself but I am not returning that thing until they give back what they took from me. [door slams] Nice. Thank you. Let's call those landscaping guys today. Yeah, sure. I make a really good cup of coffee. Mmm. I bet. Is everything ok? Yeah, yeah. Actually, Marie... there is something that I wanna tell you. Listen, if it's about last night, I'm not looking for anything, either. It was just fun to hang out. I don't want anything weird between us. Ok? I understand if you have other things going on in your life, um, I just uh, want things to be uh, no drama between us, ok? I don't want drama, either. So I'm with you one hundred percent. Ok? Are we cool? Of course, yeah. You have coffee on your lip. Oh. Hey, uh... Wanna go on a break? Can I ask you something? Why do you love this house? I like how it makes me feel. How it creaks every day before sundown, like it's stretching. I like how different the kitchen looks in the morning than how it did the night before. I like the sounds of the ocean at night in my bed. Sometimes I wake up just before sunrise and I just lay there, listening. There's always a point where the waves get really loud and angry and I feel like they're going to swallow the whole house and I get really scared. How I'm all alone in there. And then a few minutes later the sun comes up, the waves die down, and I get up and I open all the windows and I make coffee, and I look outside. And I swear at that moment there's nothing in the world that I'd rather have. It's taken me a long time to be able to say that about anything. And that's what I love about the house. [slap] Hey! Where do you go? Be with me. See? It's not scary. [baseball plays on the radio] Howdy. Care to join me? [turns radio off] The coast is clear. Church. Here you go. Don't mind if I do. Where you been? Rough day? Yeah. Just... weird. Weird can be good, son. Sometimes I miss her, dad. I still miss her. I know you do. I know you do. But now what? Here we are, two years later. Now what? What's next? I don't know. Let's figure it out then. What do you want, Bruno? What do you really want? I want to honor her life. By being miserable? Who knows? Maybe that's the reason why your decisions don't pan out. She's gone. You might also want to remember that while she was still here things weren't perfect, either. You came over one night, we sat in these very chairs and you thought you might leave her. So stop fooling yourself into thinking things were flawless before she got sick. Oh, hey. I know how much you loved her, son. But if you really wanna honor Lydia's life maybe the best course of action is for you to finally live your own. Now, we do need to return that horse before your mom loses her mind. [chuckles] [laughs] [chatting softly] I'm having a barbecue this weekend. I want you to be the guest of honor. My friends are coming in from Seattle. My step-brother- I thought all your friends were in Boston? Yeah, some of them are. Where are you going? We gotta finish the kitchen, by the way. I'm so tired of seeing it like this. All these cabinets and empty drawers and... ugh. It's so depressing. [starts shower] [turns shower off] You fucking asshole! It was in the kitchen the whole time? This is great! Dude, we gotta bring this over to Cuco right away, man. This right here seals the deal. Uh, no. Maybe we just- just hold off on that for a minute. What do you mean? Well, you- you know. No, I don't know. What're you talking about? Um, well, Marie. Remember Marie? Well, I've been doing the renovations with her- I didn't want anyone else messing with the house. And um, she and I, we've gotten to know each other. We've kinda gotten close, you know? Are you fucking Marie? No. No, no, no. I'm not fucking her, it's not like that. You're fucking Marie?! Keep your voice down, it's not like that, I'm not fucking her. It's more than that. More than what? Are you, like... involved with her? As a friend... This is great, man. I'm so happy for you. This is serious! I'm in serious trouble! She has no idea she's living in my house. Don't let this get all tangled in your head, man. This is great news. You found someone. And I can tell you like her. And you're getting your house back? It's like- it's like every single star is aligned for you, man. No, you don't get it, do you? She has no idea who I am and when she finds out that I've been lying to her all this time she's never gonna want to see me again. I lied to her about my house, I lied to her about my job, I lied to her about where I live. I lied to her about everything. It's creepy, man. Do you like this woman? Yes. This is what you do. You sit her down and tell her the truth. She'll understand. Now, what do I do about the will? Do I give it to my cousin or not? Once he gets it they'll void that sale in a heartbeat. I don't know. You have to know, brother. Fine. Go ahead. Bruno, we have had enough of your antics. We want our horse back. I don't know what you're talking about. Cut the crap. What horse? What the hell is this about? You know perfectly well what this is about. You stole our golden horse and my wife can't stop talking about it. Now is really not a good time. Not a good time? Where is our goddamn horse? Mr. Black, you don't wanna be having this conversation with me right now. That piece carries a very significant meaning for my wife and I will fight you for it. She had it shipped from Mongolia. Mongolia? Mongolia! And what exactly makes you think that I would give a shit? That horse is the ugliest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. I wouldn't want it anywhere near me! What's going on out here? Uh, nothing, mom. It's ok, you can go back inside. What's the fuss? The fuss is that your son stole our golden horse and I'm here to pick it up. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you too? So you're in on this lie, too? How dare you call me a liar? If we have to explore a legal avenue I will put you people in jail for this. You're the one who should be in jail, Gerard Black. Excuse me? You heard me. You're the one committing crimes here, building a fortune on the backs of hundreds of hard-working people struggling to pay their rent on your overpriced properties all over the island. I have a legitimate business. But that wasn't enough for you, was it? You had to go after my son. The man who took your daughter for his wife and loved her with all his heart until the day she died and never betrayed her, not once. And you waited until my son was down on his knees and went after him like some horrible act of revenge, and for what? Because he stood by her and took care of her when you and Nancy couldn't. You disowned your own daughter. If that's not a crime I don't know what is. Now listen to me, Gerard. I don't want your golden horse. I haven't got your golden horse. Now get the fuck off my property! [starts car] Whatever shenanigans you've been up to, Bruno, it's gotta stop right this minute. Do I make myself clear? Mmmhmm. [distant chatter] Hi. Hey. Oh. House looks good. Thank you. I want you to meet Miguel. Marie, is there somewhere we can talk? There are the drinks. I probably won't stay for long. Miguel, meet Bruno. Miguel, Bruno. My baby step-brother. Bruno. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. [Spanish music playing] ♪ No, in all seriousness I want to take a moment to remind you all how far this woman has come. [cheering] Yes. When Marie first became my sister and my friend- Yes. Years ago, she was still a student. She was juggling two jobs, her mom was sick, she had just started her writing career, she couldn't stop smoking pot... [crowd laughs] And- and you used to say "I think I'll one day take shelter in the forest". I know. Which was so weird and we thought was crazy and now we get our comeuppance because look at this place. We all do. We all do. You have a beautiful new house. It's so good to have you guys here. And you deserve it, so I'm gonna break this bottle right now and say congratulations. Thank you. [smash] [cheering] Go write a goddamn book! [loud music playing] Oh god. That will kill her. [music stops] I'm... uh... Look, what it essentially states is that the sale of the house has been nullified so you have to, uh, vacate the premises within two weeks. I don't understand. What- what does this mean? Bruno. What're you doing here? The fuck? What's this? Why is your name on this court order? Can someone explain what's going on? You got your house back, Bruno. Congratulations. What is he talking about? Unfortunately this house is Bruno's property. He was wrongfully evicted but now it's been all cleared up. Is this a joke? Say something! I- I don't... Why did you think you had to hide this from me? When- when I... you... you see, my wife- You're married? No! No. She's dead. She died. She died. Two years ago. Here. This was her house. This was where we lived. Just please, just leave right now. Marie, please. None of this is what it seems like. Can you please just go? I know it doesn't make any sense but- You heard what she said. Get out. Please, just leave. Get out. [crowd murmurs] [sobbing] Jesus. [crash] [pumping] Is this a bad dream? It could be, you're on a lot of pain killers. What're you doing here? Well, at the moment I'm taking your blood pressure. Lift? Ok. I'm sorry about our date. Oh, you don't- you don't have to worry about that right now. I was a jerk. Yeah, you were. My shift is ending, ok? You're gonna be in really good hands here. I'll see you around, Bruno. I drove myself into that tree. I know. I did it on purpose. I know. I did that once. You did? Really? Yeah. Really. Why would you drive yourself into a tree? You know, I guess my life had just gotten that shitty. You know, I hate to break it to you Bruno, but uh, you don't have a monopoly on grief. He's awake. Oh. Good. Yeah. He's alright. Head on in. Oh. There he is. Oh, thank you, Jesus! Lookin' good, son. Oh... Can you talk? Say something. You're in the hospital. Do you know who we are? Can you tell us what happened? Do you want a counsellor? Hmm? You put him back to sleep. Oh, fine. I'll just keep my mouth shut then. God forbid a mother should worry. Your mother is lending you her electric blanket. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah. I just want it over with. [car door starts dinging] Don't- don't- get the fuck out! [groaning] Oh! Are you ok? Yeah. My lunch. Fuck. Fuck. Watch your feet. Ok, let's get outta here, dude. Let's go. Watch your foot! Watch your foot, dude! [clang] Let's get out of here! [alarm sets off] Go, go, go, go, go! [frantic yelling] I told you to stay away from her! Get in! Get in! Get in! Leave us the fuck alone! [gun shot] Alright, shit I dropped my keys! [alarm continues to wail] [laughs] Dude. You shoulda seen your face, man. It was fuckin' classic, man. Whooo! [laughing] Oh man. Oh man, the things one does for you. Wanna come inside, grab some breakfast? [grunts] Alright. See you around, brother. Thanks for your help. Can I ask you something? When was the last time you came into my house? I don't know. Think about it. I don't know. I don't remember. That's because it was over a year ago. Ok, what's your point? My point is I just invited you in for breakfast and you answered with a grunt. I'm sorry buddy, now's just not a good time for me. Ok, so when would be a good time? What're you getting at? What's your problem? My problem is you've been in some kind of personal meltdown for two years now, do you realize that? Forgive me for losing my wife. Oh, Jesus. Here we go, man. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you serious?! Dude, are you fucking serious?! I'm just trying to get a gauge of just how deluded you are. Do you not realize you've been talking about Lydia's death for two years like it happened yesterday? Fuck you. No, dude- What the hell are you doing? Are you outta your fuckin' mind? Give me the key. No. No, you need to hear me out, bro. We're all getting a little tired of the long face. I lost my house. And then you got it back. You got back your ocean front, custom-made bungalow and now you're angry for something else! Because I hurt someone I was starting to love! Go find her, dude! Do something! But please, for the love of God, don't just sit around for another two years lamenting how you lost another person. Don't go on and on blaming this and that, and blaming me for trying to help! I never said that. Well, you thought it. Huh? You thought it. Oh, Felix and his brilliant ideas. Cuco, what kinda cousin is that, right? We're all so desperate to help you it's hard to figure out which way to go. Now I want you to buck the fuck up, put a fake smile on your face, and come inside for a decent meal with my family, ok? Ok. Hi, I'm home. Hey. Hey, bumper sticker. Oh, hi! Bruno. Hello, Cascade. It is so good to see you. Are you staying for breakfast? Absolutely. Beautiful. Let me get you some coffee. [baby crying] Hello? Hi. Marie? Yeah? Can I come in? Of course. [door closes] Hi. Hi. I just want to talk. Ok. Look, uh, I know- I know it's hard to understand and I don't expect you to. What I did was inexcusable. I designed and built this house alongside the most important person in my life and the way that it was later taken from me was- was not right and I wanted it back, really bad. So... I made some terrible choices. I fucked up, Marie. I mean, I... I guess I just didn't count on meeting you. But you did. And yet you couldn't meet me. I was confused. Very confused. It's easy to be confused when you can't see past your nose. Look, the house is yours. I'm gonna go straight to the lawyers and iron this whole thing out. They- they don't have to nullify the sale- Bruno. The house, the house is yours. I don't need your house. I don't want it. My house is my own. Where are you gonna go? I'm gonna go write my book. Of course. Of course. You're so lost, man. I really do hope you find yourself somewhere. I'm so, so sorry. I love you.

What I was trying to do was- Yes, there's no need to explain this. Better late than never, I guess. Congratulations. Oh, hi Bruno. Hey, Rita. How's it going? Hangin' in there. I heard you got your house back. That is the best news. Congratulations. Thanks. Look, I uh, never got the chance to thank you for taking care of me. It really made the difference. You're a really good nurse, you know. I mean that. Thanks for saying that. So how're you doing? I'm good. I'm good. It's actually my last day at the market here. Really? Why? I got a job. As a nurse.

Hey. ♪ (Marie): The following pages, beloved reader, are an invitation. Over the years I've learned a thing or two about writing and it may surprise you to know that most of the lessons that are still with me come not from other books or flawless mentors. They come from moss. Yes, moss. That infinitely humble film of green that quietly blankets our forests. Mosses, as beautiful as beautiful as they may be, don't speak our language. They don't experience the world the way we do, so in order to understand them I've had to adopt a different strategy. I've had to engage in a conversation. Not just listening, not just talking, but a conversation. That's how we learn about each other's stories. By watching each other's way of traveling through life. That is a real dialogue, one where each listener allows for the other's story to be told in full. Stories about the huge and the tiny, the light and the dark, the fear and the joy, the past and the present. That is a conversation I invite you to have with me here. That is the leap I'm inviting you to take. ♪ My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley ♪ ♪ Like a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley ♪ ♪ On a cold winter's morning to a church house ♪ ♪ Just to shovel some snow ♪ ♪ I heard sirens on the train track ♪ ♪ howl naked gettin' neutered ♪ ♪ An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter ♪ ♪ Just from walking with his back turned ♪ ♪ To the train that was coming so slow ♪ ♪ You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder ♪ ♪ Throw your hands in the air ♪ ♪ say what does it matter ♪ ♪ But it don't do no good ♪ ♪ to get angry ♪ ♪ So help me I know ♪ ♪ For a heart stained in anger ♪ ♪ grows weak and grows bitter ♪ ♪ You become your own prisoner ♪ ♪ as you watch yourself sit there ♪ ♪ Wrapped up in a trap of your very own ♪ ♪ Chain of sorrow ♪ ♪ I been brought down to zero, ♪ ♪ pulled out and put back there ♪ ♪ I sat on a park bench, ♪ ♪ kissed the girl with the black hair ♪ ♪ And my head shouted down to my heart ♪ ♪ You better look out below ♪ ♪ Hey, it ain't such a long drop ♪ ♪ don't stammer don't stutter ♪ ♪ From the diamonds in the sidewalk ♪ ♪ to the dirt in the gutter ♪ ♪ And you carry those bruises ♪ ♪ To remind you wherever you go ♪ ♪ You can gaze out the window ♪ ♪ get mad and get madder ♪ ♪ Throw your hands in the air, say ♪ ♪ "What does it matter?" ♪ ♪ But it don't do no good to get angry ♪ ♪ So help me I know ♪ ♪ For a heart stained in anger ♪ ♪ grows weak and grows bitter ♪ ♪ You become your own prisoner ♪ ♪ as you watch yourself sit there ♪ ♪ Wrapped up in a trap of your very own ♪ ♪ Chain of sorrow ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley ♪ ♪ Like a long ago Sunday ♪ ♪ when I walked through the alley ♪ ♪ On a cold winter's morning to a church house ♪ ♪ Just to shovel some snow ♪
