Love will find its way through paths where wolves would fear to prey. Help me! Hey? Playing with yourself? It’s the drugs, they give me a hard-on. Liked the show? Hitler had a drug problem. I’m not Hitler. Close your eyes! Leave me alone. Close your fucking eyes! You gonna kill me? Because I don’t give a damn? Get a life... pervert! I have a life. Thanks very much. Get your shit together. Why? You work for me now. Use the money to clean up, then I’ll hire you. Randolph’s job changed my life. Cocaine falls on me like fresh snow. A god-sent gift compared to the previous crack. Even if the addiction is stronger than with cocaine, there’s hardly any difference. A normal guy couldn’t do this job. He would jerk off all the time. It’s a busy night? You’re my driver? I’m Paul. Claudia. Driving whores around has taught me a lot about these women. They have a double life. They earn money with sex. They think about money when they’re not fucking. They have sex for money no matter the consequences. All their relationships are broken. Everything all right? The guy lives in a shithole. Let’s get this over with. We done? One last job... just came in. Why do you do this? I have a sleep disorder. That's why I work at night. You snore? Yeah, that’s it. And you? This is only part-time. I do it for my child. What would you not do for your child? Sun is going to rise soon. He’s the jealous type. Women call him a control freak. You’re his therapy? I listen to him. I don’t like it. You work too late. All the creeps come out around this time. I know this guy. He’s a repeat customer. But... it could take a little longer. He thinks no one loves him. I don’t like driving past sunrise. Do I know you? Can you get me out of here? No, I’m waiting for someone. That escort is with you? Why do you look like Claudia? Please get me the fuck out of here. Look mister, I’m going to get killed. How much you gonna pay me? Five hundred! Shit, you have blood on you? Drive! Come on, drive! Fuck it. My job is to drive whores safely, from the bordello to the clients, and then back home again, and now I've fucked it up. Turn there ok? Left turn. Try to lose the car behind us. He's following us. Oh hell. Help me! Wake up! Hey! How long was I out? About an hour. How did she die? What? Claudia. Unless you tell me, I’m not sure what to do. Am I in trouble? I need to clean up, get rid of this blood. I’ll make this up somehow. You promised me five hundred. You’ll get it once I know I’m safe. This is a déjà-vu. It was never about the money. This woman ... I know her. She needs me, I feel it. I haven’t figured her out yet, but it is as if I know her already. Tell me about you. I'm that kind of girl who ran away, married young, to have a better life. What happened last night? A man was not able to manage a strong and independent woman. Claudia and I don’t have the same friends, Claudia told me she got a text message. Was it you? I tried to warn her not to go, but I was too late. He wanted the Virgin Mary, but he got a whore. He went crazy. Who? An asshole. I told you, we don't have the same friends. He killed her? I'm not sure. I think so. I panicked. I didn't know what to do. What could I have done? And what did you do? I don't know any more. It was awful. What about me? Did he see me leave with you? Probably. If he saw the car, what shall we do now? I can't just drive away like that, it won’t solve the problem. Please, help me get away from here. What about the police? They can help. You must help me. We must stay together, for safety reasons. Until I know what to do. You're worried about me? No, it's me I’m worried about. You like being here? Alone? I still want my money. When we arrive. Where do I take you? Out of town. Ok. You know, I’m not what you think I am. What are you then? I’m actually a dancer. Dancer? You’re a tough one, right? Randolph? He wants to know why I quit. We need a new car. Come. I can hotwire almost all cars. How do you know? I used to date a mechanic. This one? No. I can’t get to it. You keep watch while I get down under the steering column. What will you do? I just need to pull out the battery, ignition, and starter wires, then connect the ignition on/off wire to the battery wire and rev the engine. Cool, you’re a pro. That one will do. Ah... a convertible. Watch this. Stop!! It's a rental car!! Where are we? I’m not sure. This isn’t the freeway. I didn’t want to take risks. Why didn’t you tell me you don’t know where you are going? It’s fine, I’m just a little lost. It would make a difference if you tell me when you need my help. This is a complete waste of gas. It’s fine. We're going in circles. You’re going back to Berlin. You should help me, not make things worse. Oh really? You want to drive? I can’t. Do me a favor, stop telling me what to do. Pull over. You’re too tired to drive. I can't believe it! You snore! I don’t snore. All right. Move over, Romeo. Natasha? What are you looking at? You. What do you see? Don’t you have a boyfriend? Do you? So you’re all alone? I’m with you now. Want some coke? You don't need to get me high. I don’t like drugs. So are we going to screw? It’s a little cramped in the car. I’ve seen you before. I was resting under a bridge. You were being raped. I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else, I’ve never been raped. It was you. It wasn’t me, prove it. I can’t. I was never raped. You are mistaken. How did you meet Claudia, how did she die? I got talked into some bad shit. Claudia is not dead. I lied so you would get me out of there. I just abandoned her? If her pimp finds me, I’m so fucked. I’m dead. Thanks! I feel empty. Have you ever completed anything in your life? What do you mean? Well, you had an idea, stuck with it, and you carried it to the very end. No. I admire guys who complete things. I don’t have any goals. But I do! Yeah? What? To be a dancer. A dancer? In tights? Maybe I like women in tights. Who doesn’t? Do you really think I give a shit? We’re going to Denmark. Denmark? Copenhagen. I have an audition at the dance school. That’s a lot of gas. I’ve got the money. What’s in it for me? What are you on? Why? I don’t do drugs. Good for you. Leave me alone. Take it easy. Calm down, ok? I am calm. It would be more effective if you shot up rather than snorted it. I don’t like needles. Good thing! Hey, playing with yourself? It’s the drugs. You work for me now. Get a life, pervert! I don’t like you talking to strangers when we are together. Why not? All he wants is to fuck you! What the fuck's your problem? He's a nice guy, not a drug addict. Shut up! Do you have to be high all the time? It’s a little scary. I’m not high, I’m fine. You look high. Do you have to do that? I’m sorry. What was it we were fighting about? Nothing. I thought so. Maybe I don't want this to end? For the first time, my life makes sense. Until we arrive in Denmark. I love clouds. They come in so many shapes and sizes. Did you have kids? Nah, I’d just fuck them up. Same here. Were you always alone? I freed myself from a relationship of suffering and pain. I haven’t been with anyone since. I don’t know if it’s him following us, but I need to know the truth now. Tell me what you did. Why was there blood on you? I can’t tell you. I’m not driving any further till you confess what you did. Come on, let’s go. Not until you tell me what you did. You’re so stubborn. Stop dwelling on the past. I’m not dwelling on the past. I need to know. Suppose I tell you, what would you do? I don’t know. Would you leave me here, hurt me, or do something unpredictable? It depends on what you did. What is it to you? Because there was blood. I want to know in how much trouble I am. Is that all? Yes. I got home. I heard someone in the shower. I slipped and fell. There was blood all over. Then I saw her. Claudia’s throat was cut. I ran out as fast as I could, before he could see me. I thought she wasn’t dead. I’m sorry. I lied to make you feel better. She's dead. Why didn’t you call the police? I told you, I couldn’t, they'd think I did it. You're a liar. I've always lied, but not this time. This is really the truth. I’m so tired. Can we please go? Tired of lying and thinking up lies? Lying would be easier for me. It gives me headaches not to know whether you are lying or not. Great, am I your prisoner now? You’re a control freak. Shut up, I can’t think. I’m sure a criminal investigation is underway. And I’m going to get so fucked. Let’s get to Denmark. Get out! Randolph! Just keep walking! How did you find me? Shut up! Don’t hurt him. I said, shut up, bitch! Paul has a gun. When he returns, you're dead, Randolph. You tell that junkie you’re with to drive you back to Berlin. You have 24 hours to sort things out. It is not a warning. I could drag your ass back right now, but I want you to come back to me yourself. If you're in Berlin in the next 24 hours I won’t kill that junkie you hang out with. Leave Paul out of it. Give me a kiss. I promise, 24 hours. We have to go to the police. No, it’s complicated. How did he find us? I don’t know. Let’s get to Denmark. Is he following us? He wanted to know where Claudia is. It's ok. Just drive. It's complicated. Did he see me? No. Everything is going to be okay. Thank God. You're not eating your fries? No, please, have them. Can I ask you something? Are your tits wet? Excuse me. Do you have to stick your nose into my business? I just asked you a question. Well, I’m glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished, you embarrassed me in public. In public? In front of these old schmucks? I have to go quickly to the loo. I hope you got a kick out of all this. Geez, sorry. I don’t know if I hate or love her. But one thing is sure. I have feelings again, and because of that I trust her. Do you think sometimes about death? Yes. Sure you do. But I try not to. I think about it all day long. And it makes you a better person? I’m preparing for it. You too? No, I’m not. You’re wasting your life thinking about death. You know... before I met you, I felt dead. You gave me something to live for. Have you ever done cloud busting? Like Wilhelm Reich? Yes, but you don’t need a special device. Just concentrate on a cloud, and bust it apart with your mind power. Bam! Not working. Dance with me, Natasha made me realize that our relation to life changes all the time. We are always dancing with life. In the present, the past and the future. This liveliness is the dance of life. Maybe we’re all dancers. Life is sometimes unhappiness. What makes you happy? Being loved. Did you ever think that I might love you? Why? Because listening is loving, and I am listening to you. Listening is loving. You’re right. No one ever listened to me. Maybe you had nothing to say? Maybe. What are you doing? Just cleaning up. Of course! Why didn't I see this sooner? That’s why you’re high all the time. I don’t understand. You were in a miserable relationship, and she cheated on you. Maybe. Did you kill her? I’m not a killer. Why the guilty look on your face? If you really want to know, she committed suicide. Are you happy now? Huh? Not so fast! I don’t know you. Whatever you’ve done I want no part of it. What I have done? You’re the one with a dark past. Me? You could be a serial killer. I could … What? Hit me? Or kill me? I’m a killer? A fucking killer? You’re always prying around and pestering me. You want to know every detail about me. Fuck off, bitch! Yes, it is hard for a man to keep a secret for years. What have you done, Paul? Did you kill someone? I can’t believe I fell for you, fucking whore! I’m not a whore! I did nothing, nothing! Of course you did. You’re wrong. You suppress your anger with drugs. Why don’t you tell me who you are? Shut up, you are driving me nuts! It’s not my fault. You don't just wake up one day thinking you are a drug addict, but it has become my reality. Well then stop it! you don’t need it. I can’t stop it, I can't! Then in Denmark, it's over! I'll never see you again! Fine! What the fuck did you say to her? Do you like fucking my wife? What? Asshole! Natasha’s your wife? I gave you one chance. You fucked it up. What’s this all about, goddam? She’s sick, she needs help. You opportunistic junkie asshole! Sorry, I couldn’t know. This is a very difficult time for my wife and me. Please don’t kill me. Your wife was a great fuck, she has great tits. I’m going to kill you! My soul is already dead. Someone had first to die so that I could know how love feels. Why didn’t we simply drive on? I was on the road with a violent woman. I didn’t think of it in moments like these. Was she my salvation? Or was it another trap? What Randolph said back there isn’t true. I don’t care. He was my pimp, not my husband. Can I ask you a favor? Anything. Can we do something right once? Like find the positive things in life. Get away from our past. You really want to do me a favor? What favor? Help me get rid of the dead guy in the trunk. Looks worse than it is. What can be worse than this? If he had killed you. Do you think it’s easy to kill a man with a stone? What were you thinking? I didn't think. Just reacted to the situation. It’s not funny. We’re near Sassnitz. And? We can take the ferry to Denmark. Okay, I’ll drive to Sassnitz. Yes. Turn right here! The ferry is on the left. We can’t go there with a stolen car. Good thinking. Once we are rid of the car, I must quickly drop by somewhere. What? A friend’s house. Here in Sassnitz? Yes. What a coincidence. As if you had planned it. We’re wasting time here. I have to see if someone is home. There’s no one. Wait. You never wanted to go to Denmark. Yes, I do. You used me. You wanted to get here right from the start. I’m sorry, Paul. I had to see my baby. At least once. I’m sick of your games. All this has nothing to do with me. You told so many lies. When will it stop? Piss off! Why do this to me, Paul? Don’t you care about me? This damn nightmare is because I cared about you. I tried to help you and you sucked me deeper into your nightmare. You’re poison to everyone! You don’t mean that. Oh yes I do! I cannot trust you anymore. I’m done being your sucker. I love you! Maybe we love each other, but what does it matter? I can’t trust you. I promise you, I won’t lie anymore, ok? Lies, lies, more lies. Get the fuck out of here, piss off. I don’t ever want to see you again. I thought I had understood everything. But I was just her driver. Natasha! Natasha! I didn’t mean it. Natasha! Natasha! Wait! Hey, step back from the edge! Stay away from me! Suicide won’t solve anything! What do you know about it? I messed it all up, but please come back. You don’t have to love me, but please... step back! Do you hear me? I hear you. Slowly, back away from the edge. I didn’t mean it like that, but you keep saying I’m a liar. I’m sorry, but suicide is no solution. Please! I don’t want to lose another close friend this way. So it was all true? Yes, everything. We are in so much trouble. It’s just trouble. Yeah, just trouble. It’s my baby. She stole my baby! Fuck me, make me pregnant again! Stop it, not like that! Don’t leave me again. We’re tense because we haven’t eaten. I see you’re not good. What’s bugging you? You need to eat. Shall we order? I didn’t tell you yet, but I don’t enjoy sex. I feel nothing. Why do you say that? I’m just messing with you. Giving up my child was the saddest day of my life. I had agreed to give away my child. What’s the matter? I'll tell you what the matter is. I did every possible thing to have you, I did everything I could for your wellbeing, your health. I carried you, fed you, and cared for you. And what thanks did I get? Show me a little more appreciation. After all I’m only human. Thank you. Thanks so much for listening. You deserve better. How high were you the day you watched me get raped? You let him rape me. And you saw I was pregnant. You must have enjoyed it. It was fun, huh? This is important for me, and you just leave me? Oh my God! What? I should have thought of this. Randolph guessed you were going to Claudia and the baby. No! Jesus! That’s why he found us! He knew your plan, he wanted to stop you. I didn’t think he would find us. Not my fault! You’re driving me insane, woman! Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry! Is there anything else I need to know? Please, get it out. Knock off the bullshit and get to the point? Is that a joke or you want to tell me something? What would I be trying to tell you? Dunno! Maybe you have a sex problem? More like a drug problem! I’m sick of this! I love you, Paul! Fuck me! This is only part-time, to support my kid. Claudia? Do I know you? Paul, I was your driver. I’m sorry, you’re mistaking me for someone else. Hey! I was at the house. The woman is not Claudia. Admit it. You killed her. It’s my baby! You didn't give birth. You had a miscarriage, didn’t you? You’re lying! Or you did something even worse that is driving you crazy. That’s not true! Hey! The night I picked you up, did you kill your own child? Did you kill your own baby? Claudia knew it, so you killed her too! No! Stop it! Don’t talk to me like this. You know I didn’t do it! You know it. Stop pretending, I’m sick of your lies. You are the liar, not me! This is not show time. Admit it! Why did you drag me into this? I trusted you. That woman is Claudia and she has my baby, I brought you here to help me. I was too young to stand up for myself. I hoped you would give me the courage I needed. You know... I would be the happiest woman to have someone to spend the rest of my life with. Natasha! I felt my baby kicking inside me. We spent 9 months together. I miss my baby. I don’t want to lose him. But you did! Can’t you see? I’m so lonely. Let me go! You can’t let me go because you’re afraid of losing me. If I let you go, what will you do? I almost fell in love with you. You love me now, don’t you? It’s too late for that again. Tell me, when Randolph raped you, if he was already married to you and you were pregnant with someone else’s kid, were you working as a whore? You got pregnant on the job, didn’t you? He didn’t rape me, only punished me. He took out his anger on me. He knew I was pregnant, but wanted me back. That’s the truth. You weren't his wife, you were just his whore. His whore and his wife! I wanted it. I wanted him to rape me. What did he do to you? I’ve felt dead ever since. As if life had been ripped out of me. You were there! Why didn’t you stop him? You played his wife well, but you were just his whore. I must go. You can leave. Stay away from me! Stop playing games with me! Don’t look at me like that! Fucking bitch! Leave that woman alone! You monster! If I let you go, another person may end up dead. You’re a sick fuck! Fuck! Mummy! What are you doing here, Natasha? Claudia, you can’t plan everything this time. Get out! I’m the mother! Let me see my baby! I gave birth to her, it was my body! You were never a mother. You were sick and under general anesthesia. What the hell are you doing? Put that knife down! You little slut, I’m giving you what you deserve! No you don’t! You'll never use my body again for your own advantage! Dammit, don’t be such a coward! His name is Cassian. I gave birth to a boy! I'll take good care of him. Hello? Oh, shit! Claudia? So it was you! What have you both done? What use is the truth, now that you will not live long enough to know your child. Why do you have Natasha’s child? Natasha suffered a nervous breakdown when she was pregnant. After the birth, I simply wanted to help. So she was telling the truth all the time. Paul, you know I did the right thing for her child. Love is mad... and unpredictable. Where will you go? You know... I used to be a dancer. We are always dancing with life. In the past, the present and the future. Thank God that I am alive!
