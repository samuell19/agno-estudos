NETFLIX PRESENTS [mystical music plays] ["Jingle Bells" plays on radio] [carol singers] ♪ Let nothing ye dismay ♪ ♪ Remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas day… ♪ [man on radio] Temperatures are gonna drop-- [Grandma] All these people in the road. [man on radio] We're gonna get some snow. That cold weather is gonna stay with us tomorrow under a few clouds. Temperatures are gonna hover around freezing point, so it looks like we're gonna have a white Christmas this year with more snow expected-- [Grandma] This is horrible. More snow-- -[Suzanne] We have to turn in there. -[Grandma] Where? -[Suzanne] There. -[Grandma] Are you sure? -[Suzanne] Yeah. -[Grandma] Really? [Suzanne] Yes, Mother. ["Jingle Bells" continues to play on radio] [Grandma] God, it's so crowded. Are we there yet? I haven't the foggiest idea, honey. [Suzanne] Almost. -Mom, you helped us move. -Yes, but it wasn't dark out then. -[man] Hey! -Watch it. You almost hit those people. [Grandma] Well… these streets are so darn narrow. [man on radio] We want to know your favorite Christmas memories. Call in and-- [boy grunts and snickers] Hey! Little brats. [Suzanne] Turn right here. [Grandma] Yes, I remember now. [melancholy music plays] -[Suzanne] Jules, help with the boxes. -[Jules] Sure. I think this is a horrible plan. Why are you doing this, Suze? [Norah] Mom, look. It's beautiful, honey? Why not just stay in the Netherlands? Why do you have to move to Belgium? -This is never gonna work. -Mom, we already discussed this. Mom, I'm hungry. I'll make something when we get inside. Suze, honey, this is crazy. Why don't you leave the kids with me for the holidays? We can celebrate Christmas Eve. We can do that here. You're only thinking about yourself! What do you want? You want me to sit in the Netherlands alone, crying? It's a fresh start for me here. We're gonna get through this. -[Suzanne sighs] -[Grandma chuckles] [Suzanne] Now, don't worry about us. -Say goodbye to your grandmother now. -Hey! -[Norah] Bye, Grandma! -Oh, bye, sweetie. See you soon. -Bye, Jules. -[Jules] Bye. There. You'll change your mind. [sighs] Our new house. [Suzanne sighs] It's a new beginning. For all of us. Where are the Christmas decorations? Uh, we don't have any yet. Hey. I'll get us a Christmas tree tomorrow. Promise. [melancholy music plays] We'll decorate it and make it pretty, like we always did before. No! You don't get it, do you? I'm done with Christmas. It'll never be like before! -[doorbell rings] -I hate Christmas! Hello. Uh, we just wanted to welcome you. Is your mom home? Or your dad maybe? [footsteps fading away] -Hello. Uh, sorry. My son, uh… -[door slams] We'll still have Christmas, won't we, Mom? Of course we will, sweetie. Jules just needs some time. [sighs] Uh, I'm Suzanne. And this is Norah. -Hey, Norah. I'm Ella. -[Steph] And I'm Steph. -We brought you a little welcome gift. -Welcome to your new home. [Steph] It's just a little Christmas present to ring in the season. [Steph chuckles] [Ella] We wanted to give you something to help you settle in. [sighs] [melancholy music plays] [Papa] Shoot! Yes. [chuckles] -[chuckles] Honey. -Aw, it looks beautiful. Do you see that, Jules? That's the light of the sun, and it will always return to us. And that's why we have Christmas. So we can celebrate the light that always comes back. No matter how dark it gets. Come on, guys. We gotta get going. I'm staying here. Sorry, honey, but you can't. You're too young to stay home alone. Besides, there's nothing to eat. [cereal rattling] Okay, cornflakes. But that won't help you get tall. Besides, Grandpa is really looking forward to seeing you both. [Norah] Grandpa! Come on, hurry. I don't want to be late on my first day. [Ella] That one there. Hi. How are ya, neighbor? -Hi -[Ella] Hey. Hey, Norah, look at this. [Christmas song plays] -Huh? -[Norah giggles] [all giggle, except Jules] We don't have our decorations up yet. But Mom says we're going to buy a tree today! She is? Well, that's cool. You know what? We have lots of decorations left. So maybe we could make some together? -Would you like that? -Yes! -[Suzanne] Good morning. -Morning. -Hey. -[Suzanne] Come on, Grandpa's waiting. -Bye, Ella! -[Ella] Bye-bye! [Norah] I know the way! [Ella laughs] [suspenseful music plays] [snoring] [door opens] [Norah] Grandpa! Huh? Oh! Oh, my angel. I'm not an angel, Grandpa. We're here. [Grandpa] Good morning. -Grandpa? -Yes? [Norah] Why haven't you decorated yet? -Because I was waiting for you, of course. -Yes! [Grandpa] Hm. -Hey, Jules. -[Jules] Hm. It's gonna be fine. Mm. My shift ends at 6:00, but I'll come back as soon as I'm done. Don't worry. The longer they're here, the happier I am. You're going to be great at that new job, I just know it. You're the best cookie maker I know. -And how many cookie makers do you know? -Hm. Mom said she's gonna buy a Christmas tree later. -No? -[Norah] Yeah. I can't wait. [Suzanne] Be good. -[Norah] I will. -Bye, Jules. -[Suzanne] See you tonight. -[Norah] Bye! -[Suzanne] Excuse me. -[Grandpa] Ah, come in. -Have a look around. -[woman] Thank you. -Oh, this is so cute. -Yeah, it is. Why does this bear have a bandage on his paw? Uh, it's broken. But anything that's broken can be repaired. Oh, that puzzle looks nice. Retro. Yeah. -Looks like an antique. -Yeah, it's nice. Does, uh, it have all its pieces? Most. One piece is missing, but that is… the fun part. You don't know which one until you get to the end. Yeah. That could be fun-- I don't want a puzzle that's missing a piece. Forget it. [woman gasps] Look! This is so amazing! -I love these old things. -Oh, yeah. -Nice, huh? -How much for this? Oh! Th-that's not for sale. [man] Come on. Everything has a price. Um, well… Uh, this doesn't. Yeah, let's go then. We'll just go somewhere else. [man] Thank you. [Grandpa] Goodbye. Can I have some hot chocolate? Great idea. -You, Jules? -Yeah, whatever. Three hot chocolates coming right up. [magical music plays] I can do it. -Sure? -Yeah. Great. Hm? I guess I'll just go help Norah with the tree. [Norah] Can I put this one on? [Norah] How about here? [Grandpa] Good job. [magical music plays] [cogs whirring] [magical wind rushing] [magical music intensifies] [bell tolls] [magical wind rushing] [horn blaring] -[screaming] -[horn blaring] [man yells] [magical wind rushing] [horns blaring] [male voice] Ho ho ho. [horns blaring] [woman] Taxi! [magical wind rushing] [dramatic music plays] [music becomes gentler] [Jules panting] [tense music plays] "For Santa"? [magical music plays] [Jules] Grandpa? [male voice] Hello? Mr. Claus, is that you? [Jules breathes rapidly] [female voice 1] Oh, Mr. Claus. Is that you? Hello? [female voice 2] Hello, who's there? Hello? Who's there? Say something! [male voice] I'm not falling for this, whoever you are. [female voice 2] Is it a burglar? Guys, I think there's a burglar. [overlapping voices] [magical wind rushing] [female voice 1] Somebody help! [Grandpa] Hey, Jules? How's that hot chocolate coming? Is everything all right? Where have you… Are you Santa? Oh, I-- Grandpa, are you Santa? -Now's not the time, Jules. -[Jules] Are you Santa Claus or not? I hate Christmas. Jules. You can't mean that. Grandpa, this one needs to go on top. Right. I'll be right there. How about you do it? [Grandpa sighs] [Jules gasps] [Grandpa exclaims] [Norah] Grandpa! -[Grandpa moans] -[Norah] Grandpa! Grandpa! Punctuality is of paramount importance, uniforms must be immaculate and the wearing of jewelry is forbidden. Well, that makes sense. Brenda, what did I tell you about personal phone calls at work? -Can you believe the gall of some people? -I think-- Just because I ask a question doesn't mean I want an answer. We work seven-and-a-half-hour shifts and you get a 45-minute lunch break. That's much too thick. We always bring our own meals, because, well, we wouldn't want to eat the cookies now, would we? Well, sometimes we probably should… What is this? -[gasps] -[Joan] That's right. That's a failed cookie. And you know what do we do with failed cookies? Yes. Ooh! [pants] And what do we do when we need to take a bathroom break during working hours? -Oh, I can just, uh-- -[clears throat] We ask our supervisor for permission. And for the love of Pete, we never take sanitary breaks without permission. Got all that then? -Do you need me to repeat the question? -Oh, an actual question. Yeah. Yeah, I got it. Here. This is your workstation. [Suzanne] Um, uh, I was told I'd have the opportunity to create my own cookie and, uh, here… These are Christmas cookies Uh, my kids and I made them. Everyone really loves them. [chuckling] We make cookies here, not coloring books. [Suzanne] Would you like to try? The only cookies we make here are our own. Got that? Is she always like that? [giggles] I'm Suzanne. They call me Het. Nice to meet you. Uh, you're supposed to help me put cookies in boxes. Who'd wanna eat these boring cookies? Uh, well, um, Madam Joan invented these with a flat side. They're boring, colorless cookies made by a dragon lady. [Hetty chuckles] Here. You want to try one of these? Oh. [hesitates] It's, uh… I'm sure they're unbelievable, but it's just that I'd rather-- Go on, try one. I just made them. [chuckles nervously] [gasps] [phone ringing] Oh. It's delicious. [phone ringing] [Joan] What's going on over here? Farid, do up your coat! [Joan sighs] Sorry about that. Yeah? -Suzanne? -Yeah? Telephone. -So you're Suzanne? -Yeah. -Hey, I… I'm Farid. -Hi. Oh. Here. Ha. [Suzanne] Hello? Yeah, I'll be right there. -[Farid] Everything okay? -Uh, my father-in-law's in the hospital. Apparently he fell. I… I-I need to get my bicycle. Uh, hey, don't worry. I'll give you a ride. -What about work? -No. Family always comes first. Come on. Suzanne? Farid? You can't leave your station without permission! [sighs] [Suzanne] There they are. -[Norah] Mom. -Hi, sweetie. [kisses] Hey. How you doing? You all right? Grandpa fell off the stepladder. [Suzanne sighs] Where is he now? [Norah] In there. Hey, I… I'm Farid. Uh, I-I work with your mother. -Maybe I should just go wait in the car. -Yeah, okay. Thanks. -Ah, are you their mother? -[Suzanne] Yes. How's he doing? He's very lucky. Hm. His shoulder is going to heal, but the fall was a sign that he needs to absolutely start taking it easy. And above all, he has to avoid stress. Otherwise, next time, he may not be so lucky. -[Suzanne] Can we see him? -Yes, of course. As a precaution, we're keeping him overnight. Okay. Come. Come. [somber music plays] -Don't worry. It's gonna be all right. -It won't. It won't. -I know it won't! -[Suzanne] Jules. [somber music continues] Mom? Dad's been in an accident. It's gonna be okay. I promise. [Suzanne] Jules? Grandpa's asking for you. You're so much alike. You know that? [sighs] Both as stubborn as mules. Hey, I know this isn't easy. Just do it for Grandpa. Can you do that? -[buzzing and ringing] -Mom! -Hi, Mom. -[Grandma] Hi, Suze. Uh, listen, um, I-I was just at the mall and they had those cute fluorescent jackets. Remember the ones that had all those little lights on them? They're just adorable. Mom, Grandpa Belgium is in the hospital. -Well, is everything all right? -Yeah, everything's fine. Don't worry. [Grandma] Then why is he in the hospital? It's certainly not for a jolly old time. [man] Excuse me, ma'am? Oh, hang on, Mom. Can you talk to Grandma for a while? -Hi, Grandma. -[Grandma] Hi, sweetie. Are you at the hospital too? Yeah. The ambulance took us. [Grandma] That's scary. Are you guys all right? Mommy was crying. I was too. Oh, my sweetie. And Santa hasn't come by yet. [Grandma] Don't worry about Santa. He'll come soon. There's gonna be presents under that tree. We don't have a tree, Grandma. [machine beeps steadily] [groans] Grandpa, what are you doing? There's no reason for me to be hooked up to all this stuff. There's nothing wrong with my heart. [chuckles] -I just got a little dizzy, that's all. -Grandpa, please, lie back down. I have to get back to work. You know that all too well. -Where's the snow globe? -You have to relax. The doctor-- Jules, the doctor doesn't know anything. Come on, help me. [machines beeping faster] Your kids should wait out here. Follow me. [Grandpa] Jules! Jules, help me! Don't take those off, Mr. Claus. Now lie back down. [Grandpa] Jules, get the snow globe! -Go get it! Hurry. -[doctor] Lie back, sir. [Suzanne] Jules? There's a sandwich for you too, Ella. Oh, thanks, but I ate already. [sighs] I don't like carrots, Mom. You have to eat something healthy. [phone ringing] -Sorry, I gotta take this. -It's okay. -Hi, Mom. -Hi, Suze. Back home yet? Yeah, we just got back. What was it then? Uh, nothing serious really. He's just a bit overworked. -[Grandma] Overworked? -[Suzanne] Mom. -[Grandma] The kids are good? -Yeah, good, good. Uh, and our neighbor, Ella, is here. She's gonna look after the kids while I'm at work. Your neighbor? How old is she? -How old are you? -Fifteen. Twenty-two. -[Ella laughs] -Can I have my pencil? I gotta go. I'll call later. [phone call ends] -Are you gonna be all right? -[Ella] Don't worry about us. You wanna make some decorations with me? -Yeah? -Yeah. Okay, let's do that. You'll call if you need anything, right? Bye, Norah. -Bye, Mama. -Make sure Jules eats a sandwich, okay? -Yep. -Bye. [Ella] See ya later. [Suzanne] Bye, Jules! [sighs] Come on, Jules. What would Dad do? [knocking] Voilà. Your sandwich, sir. But without carrots. You wouldn't happen to have glue and scissors? Yeah. -I just don't know where they are. -[Ella] Okay. Don't worry about your grandpa. He just needs to rest, then he'll be fine. Yeah, but he just won't do it. He can't. Well, then, uh, you might just need someone to babysit him. [machines beeping insistently] [Jules] Grandpa? [door closes] Grandpa! What are you doing? Sh! I'm escaping. I escaped too. And did you get the snow globe? -But that's for tomorrow. -What? -First, you need to rest. -[Grandpa] I can't rest yet. All the kids! They're waiting for their presents. I came here to help. I thought you hated Christmas. Yeah, I do. But I don't hate you. I don't want to lose you too. I miss him too, my boy. [Jules] Promise me you'll stay here tonight, okay? Yeah, okay. [Grandpa] Ah. Are you sure you're gonna be all right? You could very easily stay with us. Uh, no. I'm very comfortable here. -[chuckles nervously] -I'll be here to babysit him. We'll be fine, Mom. Plus there's only girls at home. -And they're making decorations. -[Suzanne sighs] [sighs] Fine. Okay. Just, uh, take it easy, all right? And don't forget to take your medication. -And the cream for your shoulder. -Uh-huh. [sighs] All right, come here. Take good care of him. Mwah. Okay. You sure it wouldn't be better if you stayed with us? -Bye. -Bye. Yes! [jaunty music plays] I'm just doing this once, until you get better. Okay? [magical wind rushing] [uplifting music plays] Huh? Pretty cozy here, isn't it? Don't you think? But where is here? [Grandpa] Right here. How can this be? [male voice] Hey! Would you mind chitchatting somewhere else? Some of us are trying to work! Hey, take it easy now. Listen. I have good news. [male voice] Fabulous. I'm so happy for you. Now then, Holger, this is Jules. [Holger] We're behind schedule. [Grandpa] Yes, I know. That's why I brought Jules. What's this? A child? [chuckles] A child? [gasps] Ikka! Ikka, we're having a child! What? A child? Uh, when? -[Gunna] Right now. -Okay, don't panic. Hot water, towels, massage oil. Breathe, Gunna. Just breathe, all right? [breathes loudly] -Ikka, she's talking about that-- -Sh! Holger, let the women handle this. Keep breathing, Gunna! [panting loudly] -Now stay calm. Just stay calm! -Okay. [inhales deeply] -Oh, thought of a name yet? -Uh-- -Yeah. Jules. -[Ikka] Jules? Hm. -All right! -[bell dings] Oh! Oh, oh, Mr. Claus. Oh. Where have you been all night? We were all so worried. [Grandpa] Ah, my dear Essa. [groans] This is Jules. Oh. -He's the spitting image. -Yeah. And Jules is here to help us. Yeah. That's because the doctor told us Grandpa has to take it easy. Yeah, but these doctors, they don't know what they're talking about. What are they talking about? -That Grandpa has to rest. -[Grandpa] There's nothing wrong with me. [groans] It's just a little pain in my shoulder. And do you have a doctor's note? I need it to record it for administrative purposes. [Essa] All right, Holger. Mr. Claus, put me down. That's it. In your chair. Ikka, bring me a blankie, please. Mr. Claus needs to rest. Aye-aye. I'm on it. [Essa] Gunna, bring him some tea. Tea? But the steam makes my hair all frizzy. It's all right, Gunna. I don't need any tea. Ikka, get back here. Here. Just land over here. Listen. My friends, during my entirely unnecessary stay at the hospital, we have lost a precious amount of time. Yeah. We need to get our act together. -Mm. Hm. -[chuckles nervously] Tomorrow is Christmas Eve already. Mr. Claus, you-you really ought to rest. -[Grandpa scoffs] -Yep. And that's why I'm here. Like that's gonna work. -Holger. -[Jules] So what do I do? Yeah, but… But… Hm, uh, well… Jules has to learn everything from the beginning. Oh, Mr. Claus, Mr. Claus! Mr. Claus, Mr. Claus, Mr. Claus! Oh, let me tell him. Please let me tell him! Uh, yeah, go ahead. [exhales] A long, long, real long time ago, there was a big, enormous big bang. It was so loud. Deafening! It went, "Bang!" How are we supposed to work around here? [Grandpa] Uh, thank you, Gunna, but I think, uh, maybe we should, since we're short on time, we should let Jules learn on the fly, huh? -All right. Good idea. Ikka. [whistles] -Yeah. -[Holger] This is not going to work. -What? [sighs] This… This is the end of the line. Every ending is a new beginning. -[Holger] Hey! -Come. [Holger] How is a guy supposed to work around here? [Grandpa chuckles] Why are you guys so small? -We're not small! -You're just large. -Ooh! -Can you believe this kid? -Seriously. -Jeez. [annoyed laughter] It's a bit of a touchy subject. Okay. Uh, do you guys like working for Sant… For Grandpa? [all laughing] Work? [laughter] This isn't work! [Gunna] You silly, silly boy. -Christmas is the best thing ever! -Yeah! Imagine, "Hey, it's Christmas! We have to work!" Oh, no! Oh! -I hate Christmas. -[bell rings] [bell rings] Ah. Woo-hoo! [magical music plays] [Essa] Mr. Claus? [Gunna] Oh, look at him. He's adorable. This is so touching! [magical music continues] Oh, he hates Christmas. Hates it. -It won't last long. -[sighs] He isn't ready. -I really don't think this is a good idea. -He'll come around, Essa. Are you sure about that? -Well… [spluttering] Yeah, sure, he'll-- -Grandpa! You see that? My assistant. [chuckles] Right, let's get to work. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, "Get to work"? -These bags aren't going to-- -[Essa] Stop! You are not to touch those bags. Those are the doctor's orders. -I'm not doing anything. -I'm on it. Come on. Come. -Hey, Gunna, bring me the list. -[Gunna] Yes, sir, Mr. Claus. [Jules] Wow. -Nice, huh? -[Jules] Yeah. [Grandpa] Let's hear it, Gunna. Right. Let's see. Um… [Gunna hums] Some building blocks for Mila. Beautiful, isn't it? [Ikka] Hey. Over here! Here. The blocks are right there. Woo-hoo! N-no, no, no, no. And we have a princess doll wearing a pretty dress for Tommy. -There. -Right. [giggles] -[Grandpa] Gunna? -Oh, uh, yeah. A-and a pool floatie for Dominique. [Ikka] Pool floatie coming right up. Catch! -Ready? -Yep. -[squeaks] -[Grandpa chuckles] Bravissimo. [chuckles] [Gunna] ♪ Bravissimo, bravissimo ♪ ♪ Bravissimo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ That's lovely, Gunna. We really don't have time for that today though. So much talent and no one to appreciate it. Hm. Um, uh, chocolate-covered marshmallows, gobstoppers, and candy. Jules! Come here. Come. Hurry now. Follow me. Candy, candy, candy. Ah. Great, isn't it? Have some, Jules. Take whatever you like. They're all yours. [chuckles] Oh, oh! [chuckling] [Jules chuckling] [cell phone dialing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Damn. Where could those two be? Was I not clear enough about personal phone calls while you're working? I… I'm just worried about my son. You can worry about him on your lunch break. [gasps and tuts] Maybe they're busy and they just can't hear the phone. Grandpa is supposed to be resting. I don't know what they could be doing. If they're sleeping, they can't hear the phone, can they? Bad news. If we don't sell more cookies, the factory's gonna close. -[Hetty] What? -Yeah, I heard them talking in the office. But I've worked here my whole life. People don't like these crappy cookies anymore. [Hetty groans] We need to do something. Tonight, at my house. Get ready for a cookie revolution. -Oh. -Huh? [bell dings] -Did we get any more Christmas lists? -[Holger] Nope. Don't they teach kids how to write anymore? -I can't even read this. -Let me see that. It's a letter from a four-year-old and it's a drawing. [Holger laughs] You… You call that a drawing? -[Jules] Seems pretty obvious to me. -Guess it's just me then. -Oh, Holger, come on now. -[Jules] Look. "Otto wants a brother to play with." There, you see that? We don't have to teach him anything. Otto, comma, wants a brother. Aw, a brother! But we can't. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we can't. We can't give him a brother as a present. No brother. Sorry. Brothers are out. Then we'll… Then we'll um, give him, uh… We'll give him a football. Then he can go out and find friends to play with. -Great. -[Holger] Okay. Football. Or maybe he'd like a board game. -Good. Yes, okay-- -This is not working. [Grandpa] Sure it is. Have a look at what we've done already. Oh. I'm guessing what's in red are the people who don't have presents yet? [Grandpa] Oh, that's more than I thought. But with you helping, we can catch up tonight. Tonight? Oh, no, no, no, no. Mr. Claus, you need to rest. Essa, Santa has to do what Santa has to do. [murmuring] We'll set off together from Vienna, then we'll head over to Rome, then we'll make a turn and go on up to Paris, and we'll finish in London. -Simple. -Wow! Performing in Vienna, Rome, Paris, London. Oh, I wanna go too! You're standing in my light! [Gunna] Hm? [Essa and Ikka giggle] [sighs] How is anyone supposed to work around here? We should get home before your mom gets back. [tense music plays] [door rattles] Jules? Hello? -[magical wind rushing] -[Suzanne] Jules? [gasps] Mom is back! -Mom! -[Suzanne sighs] Jules. Finally! [sighs] Oh, I was so worried. I thought something had happened. Why didn't you answer the phone? I didn't hear it. Did you hear the phone ring? Mm-mm. -See you tomorrow? -Yeah. Bye, Grandpa. -[kisses] -Coming? -Yeah. -[Jules] Bye! [Suzanne sighs] I have no idea what you did, but thanks. I didn't do anything. Whoa! [Suzanne] Grandpa seemed really happy. I'm proud of you. -[Jules laughs] -[Suzanne] Button up your coat. Maybe it's not such a bad thing that we moved here, huh? We're closer to Grandpa. That's what your Dad always wanted. -How'd it go at work? -It was fine. I mean, it takes a bit of getting used to, but I'm happy Farid is there. -He's so funny. -Farid? Yeah. He's the one who brought me to the hospital. Remember? He's really helped me. And so has Hetty. -They're coming over tonight. -Why? Um, well, the factory is having a big problem and, um, I have a pretty good plan to help, with our Christmas cookies. You like them, don't you? Hey, I know this is hard, but we have to try and move on. -Maybe then we can-- -I don't have to do anything! Jules! [cell phone ringing] -Mom, this really isn't a good time. -[Grandma] What's wrong? [Suzanne] Nothing's wrong. [phone call ends] [scoffs] [Farid] So let me get this straight. You want to make your own cookies instead of Joan's a-and then smuggle them out of the factory? Oh my God! And then get them into stores instead of the old ones? [Hetty murmurs nervously] [Suzanne] And hopefully, everyone will love them. All it takes is one big order and the factory is saved. Huh. This is an awesome idea! [chuckles] You don't think it's too simple? No, no, no, no. The simplest plans are the best plans. Suzie, you're a genius. To the cookie revolution. [laughter] To the cookie revolution! Hetty? Oh, I'm not so sure. What happens if we fail and it doesn't work? It has to work. We have to take it upon ourselves to brighten up these dark days. I want to be able to show Jules and Norah that we can't keep living in the past. That… we need to move on. And even though it's hard, we can start over. [Norah] What are you doing? Nothing. Just packing some stuff for Grandpa's tomorrow. What are you doing? Nothing. Norah. [sighs] Okay. But just for a bit. Is Santa gonna come tonight? We'll see. Good night. Hey, listen. His sleigh! -Santa doesn't have a sleigh. -Yes, he does. No. He doesn't. Then how does he come visit us? He has a snow… Hey, you know that little girls have to be asleep if he's gonna come? -Yeah, but why? -Hey, come on, sleep time. But I just wanted to ask him something. What then? If he was gonna bring Daddy a present too. [Essa] Hey, how are you feeling? Good, Essa. Yeah, I was just wondering how, uh, you were you really feeling? Jules isn't the only one who lost someone. You miss him too, don't you? Yeah. I miss him. But… there's still work to do. Whoa! You should be resting, Mr. Claus. Please. But not too much. Otherwise, we'll still be at it at Easter. [Essa sighs] [chuckles] [magical wind rushing] [sighs] Jules? Jules? [groans] -[door opens] -[Jules] Well, are we going? Jules! I thought you'd never get here. So it's really real then? -Yeah, that's right. It's really real. -[Jules chuckles] Don't you wear a red hat? -Is this good? -Yeah, it's fine. Ready? No! -[Jules strains] -[Grandpa sighs] Where are we starting? The family Hoffmeyer. -Where? -Austria. All right. [cogs turning] Can we start with a present for Norah? Oh, I always save both of yours for the end. [chuckles] Okay. Ready? [magical music plays] Hans and Heinz. Hans. Where is the other one now? Oh, here. This one's for Heinz. Psst, hey, Jules, don't touch anything. [Jules] "Für den Weihnachtsmann"? Yeah, that's us. Ah. -You said we couldn't touch anything. -No. [chewing] Unless they leave these here for us to eat. [Jules] Mm. [Grandpa] Mm. [uplifting music plays] -[thud] -Sh. "Delphine…" -"Lecomte." -Yeah. She's a sweet little girl. A toy car. -This it? -Mm-hm. [squeaking] [barks] [barking] -Give him, uh, your cookie. -[barking] -I ate it. -[barking] [magical wind rushing] [dog whines] Hey. Are you sure there's nobody's in the house? -Yep, skiing for the weekend. -Okay, okay. [both] Boo! [both scream] [Grandpa chuckles] It is fun… [Grandpa chuckles] …to be Santa Claus. [Grandpa chuckles] -Yes, they did another one! -Ooh, and another one! Yeah! -[Ikka and Gunna giggle] -Hey! Could you both please knock it off with the jumping? Holger, why can't you be happy, just this once? Surely you know I am nowhere near finished the new list and take a guess whose fault that is. -[Ikka and Gunna gasp] -[magical wind rushes] -[Grandpa] That's done. -[bell dings] Hey, did you finish filling all the bags yet? [Ikka] No, not yet, Mr. Claus. We were waiting for the new list. Holger's having trouble keeping up. [Gunna laughs] -[Jules] You coming, Grandpa? -[Grandpa] Right behind you. No. No, no, no, no. [Gunna] Ooh! What's on level two? Uh, level two? Oh, ah… It's a… No clue. Ah. Ah, Gunna? Yes, Mr. Claus? [Grandpa] What's on level two? Well, level two. Uh, oh… [Gunna hesitating] Books! Yeah, tons. Tons of books everywhere. Just, yeah, big, heavy books on, uh… [Gunna hesitating] -You like math? -Ew. Ugh. That's right. Do you like math? Actually, I do. French! A ton of books in French. Mm, bonjour. Je, tu, il. Je m'appelle croissant. -[Gunna] Yeah, that's right. -[Ikka] Do you like French? Not really. [both sigh with relief] [happy murmuring] Wow. Ha! You guys really outdid yourselves. -Yeah. -Yep. [Essa] So, Jules, are you enjoying being Santa's helper? Yeah. But just this once. Right. And you're doing great. [Essa] Uh, Mr. Claus? Just once? To London! [uplifting music plays] [somber music plays] More cookies for Santa? Mm, no. -What then? -Never mind. [somber music continues] "Santa, bring Daddy back home, please." See what I mean? You're not the only one. But you can't bring dads back, can you? No. [door opening] [man] Hello? Hello, I'm home. -[child] Dad! -Ah, there you are. I missed you so much. How are you? Let's go see Mom, okay? I want to go home. [somber music plays] All right, so the next one is Max from… Uh, Uz… Uzbekistan. -He wants a pair of roller-- -[magical wind rushing] Huh? You're back already? Uh, what's wrong? Are you feeling all right? Is it your shoulder? W-w-w-what is it? He wants to go home. [Essa] I knew it. I warned you. -It's too soon. He's-- -Sh. We'll try again tomorrow. What do you say? [Holger] You'll try? We've got one day. One day to do everything! [draw closing] Come on, Jules. You seemed to have such a good time yesterday. Grandpa's gonna be so disappointed if you don't go over. -[door closes] -[Ella] Hello. -Hi. -We're gonna bake cookies today. -Yes! Oh, yay! -Ooh, fun. Okay. [Suzanne] What do we want to have Christmas Eve? Nothing too complicated, okay? -Cookies! -[Suzanne laughs] Jules? Hey! My drawing, my drawing! Jules, stop! Stop! Look what Jules did to my drawing, Mom! [Suzanne] "Bring Daddy home." I don't feel like celebrating Christmas, all right?! Doesn't anybody get that? I hate Jules! I hate him, I hate him, I hate him! I hate him. -It's all right. -I'll talk to him. Sh. [Norah] My drawing! Ni hau. [speaking Chinese] That's, "Hi, how are you doing?" in Chinese. Cool, huh? I'm afraid that's all I know. So how are you doing? Crappy. Well… Feel like talking? I'm here if you wanna. No, thank you. My dad died a year ago. On Christmas Eve. I miss him. I just hate Christmas now. My mom and Norah, they act like nothing happened. No one can force you to be happy. Or make you do things you don't want to do. Especially if you're not ready. What if you said you would? I don't know, but if you can't, you can't. [Suzanne] Hi, Grandpa. How are you feeling? How's your shoulder? Oh, another day of rest, it'll be right as rain. Hi, Jules. Jules, say hi to Grandpa. I just don't get it. Yesterday, he was so happy and now… Don't worry. I'll cheer him up. [Suzanne] I'm sorry. I would have left him at home, but-- It's all right. Don't worry. We're going to have a great time. Right, Jules? -All right. -[Suzanne] Sorry. Uh, scuba flippers, a microscope, uh, colored pencils… Jules? Oh! Jules. Come on, Jules, we need to hurry. The flippers are over there. Let's go. America's waiting. [Gunna] Oh, America! ♪ Oh, Broadway ♪ ♪ Chicago, Chicago ♪ ♪Las Vegas ♪ Ah! Okay, so next. [clears throat] Uh, "Microscope." Who'd want a microscope? "George, eight years old, from New York." Oh. ♪ New York ♪ ♪ New York! ♪ A microscope may be fun at first, but he'll get sick of it pretty quick. [sighing] I think, uh, that George from New York will be much happier with a football. What is going on? [Gunna] It's just that he said he wants a microscope. All right, what's next? Okay, uh, hm… Mm, "Coloring pencils." There. In the little boxes. See them? You get them. Little people, little pencils. [Ikka gasps] [Essa scoffs] We'll never get through this list. We have so many toys to pack. A bicycle helmet, a puzzle, a teddy bear. No, no, no, Jules. Not a skateboard. It's… It doesn't say skateboard here. Come on. We're losing time. We need to hurry up. Ikka, I'll race you to the end of the corridor. Ready, set, go! [Gunna] Jules! [Ikka] Jules, no fair. I wasn't ready! Agh! No! [Joan] Punctuality is of paramount importance. Uniforms must be immaculate and the wearing of jewelry is forbidden. One employee at a time. I wish I didn't have to keep repeating myself. Am I making myself clear? Yes, ma'am. Going my way? If she sees this, she'll toss me out. It won't matter. They'll close the factory either way. Okay, so you take a bit of this and smooth it out like so. [gasps] [gasps] What now? Anything for the cookie revolution. -Hetty, what are you doing? -[Joan] Het? Het, did you ask to take a sanitary break? Het? Okay. Try to make sure she doesn't see you. Take these, all right? You just saved us. I think I actually do have to use the toilet now. Come on, Essa, it couldn't have been that bad. Well, it was. It was just terrible. The boy hates Christmas from the bottom of his heart. Oh. Jules, done already? I want to go home. Jules, we, we still have all those presents to deliver in America. -Yeah. -You do it. But, Jules… No one can force me to do what I don't wanna do. Bring me home now? I'm not giving up. All the boy needs is a little nudge. And do you propose to do that? You don't need to know. I have my ways. [Ella] Hey, want to join us? No. All right, but these are for the cookie revolution. Your mom's a real hero. She's going to save the whole factory. [phone ringing] -Hello? -[woman] Jules? -Yeah. Hi, Grandma. -[Grandma] Is your Mom there? [Jules] I don't know. -Are you at home alone? -No. Um, did she get a tree yet? No. But I'm sure it's just because she did some shopping to make a delicious supper tonight? [Jules] Nope. Really? Well, that's a bit disappointing. But she might be doing groceries right now. -Yeah, sure, maybe. -[Grandma] Okay. [laughs] -Perfect. -[Jules] Bye, Grandma. [sighs] [sighs] Grandpa? [panting] Jules! Psst, Jules! Gunna! -[panting] Hi. -What are you doing here? Oh, Jules, something terrible has happened. An absolute disaster. -I-It's a catastrophe! -Tell me. I wasn't actually there, but, oh, I wish I was. If I'd been there, this never would have happened. -I'm not sure what exactly I could-- -[Jules] Gunna, just… Instead of just letting him go gallivanting-- -Gunna, calm down! -Instead of just resting. -[Gunna inhaling deeply] -Tell me what happened. Mr. Claus, he went out to deliver the presents. [voice shakes] And… And he… Oh, he fell! [Suzanne] Jules. Make sure you keep an eye on Grandpa, okay? Do we really have to move? Yeah. We'll be closer to Grandpa that way. I promised Dad we'd take good care of him. It was his last wish. [Gunna] Jules! Jules! I think it's all my fault. Jules? [spluttering] Do something! Don't just stand there all chiseled and ripped. -Oh, thank god for you, Jules. -Yeah. Okay, Jules, we have to do something right now, immediately, now. Let's go! -Okay. -Now! [Gunna panting] Hey. [Grandma] Hey, sweetheart. Grandma, we made cookies! Come and see. Hello. And you are? Ella, the, uh, sitter. Where's Jules? His room. [twinkling music plays] [phone ringing] -Hi, Mom. -[Grandma] Twenty-two? This girl is barely 14. Fifteen. -[Grandma] Shame on you. -Mom, this really isn't a good time. [Grandma] Not a good time? [scoffs] Where's Jules? He's with his grandfather. [Grandma] No, he's isn't. There's no one there and he isn't at your place either. You don't even know where your own kids are! I'm on my way. Sorry, but I have to go. Jules has gone. What's going on here? [Suzanne] My son, he's… -[Grandpa groans] -There you go. Does it hurt? [groans] Yeah. [Grandpa groans] But whatever has been broken can be fixed. Right? Why did you go out alone? That was dumb. Oh, dumb? Well, I… I had no choice. Jules… [groans] As Santa, I have to do my job, or else kids won't get their presents. I know you don't feel the same way. But that's the way I feel. [groans] I have to get a move on. Can you get me my cane and help me up? -[Jules] You stay there. -I need to get going-- [Jules] Grandpa, I'll do it! You stay there. I never should have left you. My dad… [Gunna stifles sobs] You stay here, okay? I'll do it. Alone. [inhales] All the bags for America ready? -Uh, almost. -But we're gonna get right on that. -They're not done yet? -They will be. -That's right, don't worry. -Don't worry. Did you really think I wouldn't notice these colored monstrosities? You're all very lucky that I can't afford to lose any of you right now, otherwise I'd fire the lot of you. Every last one. I need to go find Jules, guys. Go on. Don't worry. We'll cover for you. [Suzanne] Are you sure? I don't want you to get fired because of me. We're sure. Now go find your son. I'm so sorry for all this, guys. Don't be. This is the most exciting thing I've done in my whole life. Now go on. So we have been making these beautiful Christmas cookies for 30 years. Traditions need to be kept alive, not crushed and destroyed. Now I'm giving you all one last chance. I'm giving you four hours to make all the cookies we need. So you'd better get moving. This is way too big, isn't it? Oh. [Grandpa groans] [Grandpa sighs] Here. Just wait. Mm. One day, it'll fit you perfectly, Jules. Ah. Mm. Mm! There you go. Remember, I'm only doing this once. [Essa] Oh, Jules, you look amazing. -This is going to be incredible. -Huh. [sarcastically] Real incredible. Too bad we'll never make up that lost time. Of course we will. You just have to believe you can do it. [Holger straining] What are you doing? Trying to believe it. It work yet? -No. Didn't work. -[Essa sighs] [Grandpa] Jules. Be careful. [magical music plays] [magical wind rushing] Jules? [upbeat music plays] [giggling and cheering] [Grandpa] Yes! Yes! Ha ha! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! [Grandpa chuckles] [Grandpa] Jules, we love you. -Mr. Claus, your leg! -Are you not in pain? Well, that was a quick recovery. [Gunna laughs] Oh, hey, look! [laughter] -[cell phone ringing] -It's Suzanne. -Ah. -Did you find him? [Suzanne] No, and I have no idea where he could be. Don't worry. I'm sure he won't do anything stupid. [Suzanne] Could I borrow your car? What are you doing? -[Suzanne] Farid? Hello? -Suzanne. First you put the entire factory in jeopardy, and then you have the audacity to leave without permission. [Suzanne] I'll be back when I find Jules. If you value your job, you'll get back immediately. Do you hear? -[Suzanne] I'm going to find my son. -[dialing tone] And I'm going to help her. See you later. No you won't, 'cause you're fired. I mean it! Bake! Bake! [bell dings] [Essa] So you lied? [Grandpa] I had no other choice, Essa. [Essa] He's isn't ready! I tried to tell you, but no, "Oh, my leg, my leg, I hurt my leg." You lied to him to get him to take over the whole operation when you know he doesn't want to. That's not true. He does want to. He just doesn't know it yet. He just needs to start loving Christmas again. That's all. Jules! Wait! Stop him! Jules, no! Somebody stop him! Stop! Jules, not level two! No! [gasps] [somber music plays] [shudders] I think he went to level two, Mr. Claus. [suspenseful music plays] "Elizabeth Claus." "Wilhelmus Claus." "Otto Claus." "Henricus Claus." "Virginie Claus." Grandpa. Dad. I'm sorry, Jules. Sh, it's all right, it's all right. I'm so sorry. I hoped you'd start loving Christmas. That would have made this easier. Easier for me to explain all of this to you. Our history. The title of Santa Claus or Mrs. Claus, Jules, has been passed down since the dawn of time from generation to generation within our family, the family Claus. I thought Santa lived forever. [Grandpa chuckles] No. Look at me. Huh? We all grow old and then we pass the title down to who's next in line. Your dad had already been doing the job of Santa Claus for quite some time. Until… His accident. Yeah. Yeah. And I thought you were too young, so I kept doing it myself. But I… I'm too old now. My best days are over. I'm worn out. That fall, the hospital. Huh? Look. Here's a letter from your father. He wrote it especially for you. All of these Santas wrote letters like these to their successors. Because, Jules, one day, you will be the new Santa. No! I told you I'd help once! Dad is dead. And so is Santa. [sad music plays] [magical wind rushing] Eleven years old, blond hair. Yes. No, this afternoon. Right. Yeah, okay. Yeah, thank you. They're gonna look for him. -[Suzanne cries] -Hey, it's gonna be all right. Don't worry. [Suzanne sobs] [Suzanne continues sobbing] [Suzanne] Jules! Jules, where were you? We were looking all over for you! -Where's Grandpa? -Home. Why aren't you with him? You're supposed to be looking after him. I can't believe how selfish you can be sometimes. [Suzanne sighs] [door opens] Mm, so the lost son has returned. We were all really worried, Jules. You need to snap out of it. You said nobody could force me to be happy. Yeah, but there's a big difference between that and terrorizing everyone else because you feel sorry for yourself. Your mom just lost her job because of you. -You know that? -What? I never should have said that. Hey, we all make mistakes. Moms included. So you're saying I made a mistake then? No, no. I'm saying you're doing your best. And Jules knows that too. What is that? [Jules] Nothing. From my dad. Shouldn't you open it? Why not? Because it's a goodbye letter, okay? And if I read it… then he's really dead. [inhales] You have to learn to let go. What would you know about that? You have your dad. I don't. I've lost everything. [Ella sighs] [melancholy music plays] No more, uh, ballet. No more pretty short skirts. A stupid accident. And it was nobody's fault. [Ella sighs] Being mad with the world won't change anything. You've still got so much, Jules. Open it and read it right away. [melancholy music continues] Why don't you go talk to him, okay? Okay. I'm sorry about what I said. Me too. You really get fired 'cause of me? No. Of course not. [sighs] I've just been really stupid. Simple plans are always the best plans. I thought I could save the factory on my own. And that everyone would fall in love with my cookies. And one big order of my cookies would suddenly… Well… You were just trying to color these dark days. -[Suzanne] Mm. -[kisses] [melancholy music plays] [Papa] Jules, if you're reading this, it means I'm gone. But this isn't a goodbye letter. It's a new beginning. Just like Grandpa took over the job from his father, now it's your turn to take over from me. To carry on this tradition that our family has been blessed with. I may not be around anymore, but I'll always be part of you. It's up to you now to bring light to the darkness. My spirit beats inside your heart. Together, we are Santa Claus, now and forever. -[Ella] Jules? -Sh. I have to go, but no one can know about it. Where are you going? -To let go, and save a tradition. -Which one? I'm going to save Christmas. Are you all right? Never been better in my life. [sighs] Thank you, Ella. For what? [magical music plays] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! [sniffling] [bell dings] -Why does everyone look so sad? -[Essa] Oh, it's Jules. He's back! This is a celebration. A celebration of a new beginning. -Really? -Seriously? Come on, let's do this. Ooh, come on, guys! Go. [excited chatter] [uplifting music plays] He's the spitting image. Welcome, Santa Jules. It's about time. [Grandpa] Are you sure you don't need me to come along? No, I'm good. I have a little detour to make first. -Huh? -One that's a bit too much for your age. [Essa] Oh, uh, should I be worried about this? Long live the cookie revolution! Can someone explain to me what the cookie revolution is? Uh, oh, uh, uh… [suspenseful music plays] Mm. It tastes like… Christmas. [uplifting music plays] One big order. Enjoy, Madam President. [uplifting music continues] [excited cheering and laughter] [dog growling] You want a cookie? Good, huh? [excited chatter] [Holger] Hey, hey, hey! [Holger chatters excitedly] Cool, huh, Holger? -Aw! -Shake it, Holger! Shake it! Woo, woo, woo! Jules! Madam President of America wants my cookies? Oh, the colored cookies, yeah. Colored cookies, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. The colored cookies. The colored cookies. Where are all the colored cookies? Hey, where did all the colored cookies go? Oh, why won't anyone around here answer me? -I'm gonna go check on Jules. -Oh, don't worry. I just checked on him. He wanted to stay in his room a bit longer. Oh. Okay. I just hope he's not going to stay up in his room moping all night. [Norah] Mom, I'm hungry. Right. What were you thinking of making the kids for dinner? -Um, I don't know. -What do you have in the fridge? -Not much. -[doorbell rings] I can get that. With everything going on, I haven't gotten around to shopping yet. [door opens] Norah, honey, come. Let's you and me go shopping. We'll pick up something nice for, uh… For Christmas. -Spaghetti! -[chuckles] No. The president called. Apparently, the president of the United States wants your cookies. Huh? I don't get it. She placed a very large order for Christmas dinner at the White House with all the heads of state and, if all goes well, we'll be her regular supplier and the factory will be saved. [Suzanne laughs] We have to hurry. The order has to be shipped tonight. -[Suzanne] Tonight? -[Joan] Yes. Sorry, but I can't do that. Why not? Because we're celebrating Christmas tonight. I promised. Well, maybe tomorrow we could do that. Really? Yeah. Okay. Who's up for this? -I am -I'm not! I'm going shopping with Grandma. And Ella can come too. [laughter] We're never gonna finish this order. It's not like we didn't try. [door opens] Need a hand? [Suzanne gasps] -Shouldn't you be celebrating Christmas? -Absolutely. So let's get to work so we can all be home in time to have our Christmas dinner. Come on! Joan, what's taking so long with that dough? I'm working on it. Just because I ask a question doesn't mean I want an answer. Is that clear? Hurry. Those cookies aren't going to bake themselves. Get moving! Come on! [Grandpa] Mm. [Essa] W-was that… Was that the last one? One last house in London. [pilot] Are you ready for takeoff? Yes? Yes? [child laughing] [pilot] Three, two, one! [child laughing] [pilot imitates plane engine] Come on, Jules. -What's taking him so long? -I can't watch! Let's go see Mommy. Let's go. Come on, Jules. Come on, Jules. [serene music plays] [uplifting music plays] [cheering] You… You did it, Jules! [uplifting music continues] [magical wind rushing] [cheering and applause] [cheering] Come on, Holger, hoof it up! Well done. You did it! -[Gunna] Woo-hoo-hoo! -You did it, you did it! How did you learn everything so fast? Mostly I learned that my dad's right here. [Grandpa] That's right, Jules. I always knew you'd be able to do it. You did it. We're done. No, we aren't. -Oh. -Oh. -[Farid chuckles] -We did it. [Farid chuckles] Merry Christmas, everyone. [both] Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -[Joan] Ooh. [Hetty and Joan laugh] What is it? Jules? He'll be fine. [gentle music plays] Merry Christmas. It was him. You did all this? [sighs] [Grandma] What's all this? Oh. [Norah] A Christmas tree! And so many presents! [Ella laughs] Wow! Jules. Oh my… [Ella laughs] [sniffs] Saving Christmas? -Hm? -[Norah] Ella. There's one for you here. [Ella giggles] [Ella] Like? It's pretty right? Merry Christmas, everyone. It was nice meeting you. Farid, wait. Come. -[Norah] Look, Grandpa! -[Grandpa] Come on up here. [Norah] I got a unicorn! Careful, guys. It's very hot. -Ah, bravo. -Wow, yum. -Bravo. -[Grandma] Just be careful. It's hot. -Yeah. -[Farid] It looks great. It's snowing! It looks like we're going to have a white Christmas, so I would like to make a toast to a beautiful white Christmas. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers. -[Suzanne] To a white Christmas. -What do you think, Jules? -Cheers. -Same time next year? -You bet. I can't wait! [Grandpa chuckles] Oompah! [laughs] Merry Christmas! Yippee!
