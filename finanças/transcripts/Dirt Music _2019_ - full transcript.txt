Hey. Hey. Who'd leave you all tied up, eh? Handsome fella like you. Shit. You're a bit crazy, aren't you? Bugger it. - I can pour my own. - Yeah, you can pour it - all over the kitchen and I get to clean it up. - Ow! - Don't hit your brother, Josh. - He doesn't mind, Georgie. - I do mind. - I'm going to trust your brother on that one, Josh. Stop it. Hello? We're bringing in the big one. We've got more crays than we can bloody crate. Even had to empty the hold. Well, that's great. Would you get Beaver on the docks? We're going to need probably three vans. Maybe four. Good on you, Jimbo! Hey, Boris, tie it off. That's it, just there. Jim Buckridge, the catch of the year! - Yogi. - Good on you, Jim-Jim, mate. Cheers, Jimbo! Yogi. Ava. You want a red or a white? Hi. Buckridge! Buckridge! Buckridge! - Cheers. - Hey, Georgie. - Get off! - Fuck off, mate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your husband, he just earned a nurse's annual salary. You know I used to be a nurse. - I do. - And that he's not my husband. You know, you're the only one that wants to talk to me, Beaver. You know, you're the only one not smiling. You know that, don't you, Georgie? Is that right? I mean, in this town, if a Buckridge catches a whale, you slap on a smile and you appreciate it. But you're not from this town, are you? I'm going for a slash. "The large ships never pass by without stopping. "On a small island in a gigantic sea, Ari feels like he..." He got off late. Excited for you, I reckon. I took upwards of 70 grand today. Maybe 80. That's great. Yeah. Well, shut the talkers up, anyway. Talkers? Yeah, those that talk. And what are those that talk saying? Oh, the usual White Point shit, you know. I've lost my touch, Father was better... Yeah, some of them even talk about you. I'm drunk. I'm going to go to bed. I hoped I'd see you again too! Hello. Good catch? Funny time to be out fishing. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone I saw you. You'd better hope no one else sees you, though. Right. You do speak, then? I thought you were hurt. I thought you were a body. I am a body. You shouldn't leave your dog tied up. It keeps him safe. Hmm. Morning. Bit of a swim? Swimming in the dark on this coast? I wouldn't do it. Jim... we should probably talk. No, everything's fine. Don't overthink it. Oh, come on. Hello, again. Just choked and cut out. I've nearly killed the battery turning it over. Injectors, maybe. Don't know. It's a computerized something. You know how these cars get. I'm not good with computers. Me neither. You call your service? No reception, not out here. Hey. Are you having some kind of party? I guess I could run you in to White Point. That'd be brave. Where'd you sell your catch? The city? Because that's where I'm heading. I can't tow your car. Bust my transmission. I'm not fussed about the car. You're busy. You've got your party to organize. I'm not having a party. You get going. Can't leave you on the side of the road. Not in this heat. I got reason to fear you? Not that I know of. Fine. You talked me into it. What's he called? Doesn't have a name. He doesn't have a name? No. I need to sort something at my house. It's on the way. There's shade over there. Don't have any paracetamol, do you? Rain water. Shit-free. It's cooler inside. I'll just be a few minutes. Thanks. You're staying here. Big reader? Passes the time. Who do you read, then? Steinbeck, I'll bet. And Hemingway, obviously. Conrad? I see you have a set. What about women writers? You like any women? You live at White Point? I do, but you're changing the subject. - Teacher? - Fuck, no. Nurse. Ex-nurse. Why'd you guess teacher? Books. Your old man is an exporter or a fisherman? You needn't worry. I'm not a very loyal fishwife. Jim Buckridge. - Fuck. - If I was gonna say something, you don't think I'd have said something by now? Your old man is Jim Buckridge. I haven't married him. What do you want with Perth? I got a room booked. I need a few days away. So you're running from him. I'm helping you... run away. You think that's dangerous, try stealing from his plate. You do know what'll happen if they catch you? All I'm saying is, why not take up something less dangerous... like bomb disposal? Hands shake. What? Don't have the hands for bomb disposal. You coming in? I'll buy you a beer. I owe you one. Thanks. I've got to be somewhere. I don't want to spoil your plans, but I think this is one-way. Guess you're stuck. Weird old day, that's all I was thinking. Weird old fucking life, to be honest. Let's hope they've got decent beer. None of that Belgian shit. What? We still have our clothes on. I don't know your name. I'm Georgie. Georgie Jutland. Lu. Lu Fox. Pleased to meet you, Georgie. Very bloody pleased, I hope. I've heard of you. What you heard? You're in some sort of band. You're a muso, right? Don't play anymore. No? Don't even listen. And that's all you heard, is it? That's what the Foxes are famous for. No. I heard what happened to you... and your family. Let's have that beer. I promised you a beer, didn't I? The fridge is over there. Hey. You're worried about your dog? He's not my dog. You're worried your fish will have melted? They're crays.

Didn't say anything, she just up and went. I'm not sick, Jim. No, I didn't think you were. And I'm not Debbie. Yeah, I know you're not. ♪ I will put ♪ ♪ My ship in order ♪ Is that a good idea? I just wanted to remember what you look like right now. You got to go home, you know. For both our sakes. I don't understand what you're doing living like this. I did think about going north. The last funeral, I came back... burned all my papers, licenses, any ID. I wish I'd burned everything. I already felt like a ghost. Figured, why not become one? So now you poach other people's fish, read man books and don't listen to music. Come on. I've got somewhere to show you. I should have worn shoes. You want a piggyback? Come on. Gonna get up or not? Oh! Aah! Hi. Your dog slobbered on me. Good boy. He likes you. Used to come here a lot. Bird loved it. She said once, "This is my place." Sort of declared, "This is my country." Bird's your...? Niece. She was my niece. Didn't used to be illegal, what I do. Then suddenly everyone's paying everyone for bits of paper that tell us the Foxes can't go fishing no more. So we farmed melons. Weren't any good at that, so we played music. You ever heard of a place called Coronation Gulf? Chain of islands up north, way out in the Timor Sea. Far north. I got stuck on one of the islands once. Are you a sailor, then? If I was a sailor, I wouldn't have got stuck on a sandbank for two days. But the place? Mostly scrub or thick trees, mangroves, boab trees, crocs, fish, birds... no humans. - None? - Complete peace. So isolated it could kill me. That kind of isolation's good to have once in a while, you know? And there was this moment, when the tides changed, that the whole ocean came alive. This big, heaving, living thing that makes you feel so small you might not even exist. My point is, I get why Bird liked it here. Because that's my place. My country. What are we doing? Hanging out. What do you think we're doing? We're not teenagers. How do adults do it, then? You still fucking him? You want me to stop? Done. You got me. You haven't lived in White Point long enough, you know that? - Hey, Georgie? - Yeah. We're going to need an ambulance on the jetty in half an hour. And can you find us a new deckie? Boris is out of it. He's got blood from asshole to breakfast. - Is he conscious? - Don't use the radio. I've only pulled two lines. Don't need a pack of nature's gentlemen pillaging me pots, all right? Okay. - Head injury. - Up he goes. There you go, Boris. There you go, mate. Here. The pupils on him. You fucked up, Boris, eh? - Yeah. - What can I do? Well, I don't know, love. What can you do? You should probably keep him warm in case he goes into shock. We got this, Georgie, eh? Boris, can you hear me, Boris? Hey? You fucked yourself. Hey, who's up? Yup. Is that the best you could find? All right, kid, what are you waiting for, a printed fucking invitation? Come on, get on. Hey, don't die, Boris. And then he tried to tell me he could run faster than me, but we had a race and I easily beat him. Well, I hope you made him feel okay about that. I beat him. He is never going to feel okay about that. How was it? Pots might as well have been pillaged. - That bad? - Yeah. And Boris? Oh, he needed a few stitches, but he was never pretty. I'm a nurse, Jim. I could have helped with Boris. Yeah, well, you did. You got Yogi and Ava. - Jim. - I called you, didn't I, to sort it out? You do that as a favor. Well, you've got your life, I've got mine. That's how it works, doesn't it? Fuck you, Jim Buckridge. You vicious bastard! - Hey, what state are you in? - Have you hurt him? - Hey, hey! - Did you hurt him? What have you done? What have you done to him?! I've fucking done nothing! What did you do, eh? What did you do? As soon as he touched you, his hands should have fucking burned. - Fuck you! - Yeah? Go in the spare room and sober up, for fuck's sake. I've got a fucking machine! I don't understand a word you're saying, love. Georgie, I've got a fucking machine. I think she thinks there's too much oil in your clothes. She doesn't want to fuck up your machine. Yeah, but if I fuck up my machine, I'll fix my machine. I'm a mechanic. I'm a mechanic! I didn't know you'd met someone. Haven't you heard them laughing at me yet? - No. - Yeah. Proper love match. I need a car, Beaver. Now, why would I do something stupid like that? Because I'll pay you. One car, one night. That's all I need. Now, you promise to return this, Georgie, by morning. I'm the one taking the risk here. If he notices or even knows... I know. I can see you! I can fucking see you! Lu? Lu. This alcohol? Darkie brewed it. Fuck. Trust me, Lu Fox. How'd you meet him? Jim. You want me to talk about Jim? I want to understand. Understand what? Why you'd want him and me. I ended up in this resort in Bali. Jim was there. I didn't know it at the time, but it was the first holiday he'd had without his wife. Debbie. I saw him on the beach with his kids. Started playing with them. Things just happened. Maybe I just settled for something rather than nothing. He said you should have realized what it meant to touch me, as if I was his property or... Bird was alive for a while. After the... Did you know that? On machines. They kept shoving all these forms at me. I didn't want to do it. And I stayed and stayed. It's like I got tired, you know? They wore me down. Signed them, and like that... she was gone. Sounds like mercy to me. It was convenience. Music will undo you, because it makes you forget. It takes you somewhere else. Whatever's been done to you, whatever you do to yourself, it's not allowed, you know? You're not getting that convenience. It's too convenient. I'm a burning, screaming wreck. And I'll always be one. But I knew what it meant to touch you. Beaver? Beaver? I've got your car. Are you awake? Hey, call your sister. Call your sister. She's been trying to get ahold of you. So you're just here to pass a message on? Where have you been? With him? That is no fucking business of yours. Georgie, whatever you think happened, it fucking didn't. You're an animal. Georgie...

How are you, sis? Underdressed. It's been too long, Jude. It has been too long, hasn't it? - I didn't mean... - Yeah, I know. We grow up and we go to live abroad and then on boats, and then with fishermen who don't like our family. - Jim likes you. - Does he? Dad's coming over. Shit. And he's got that look on his face. Georgina. Learned counsel. Mm. Good Lord. That's some tan. You got a bit of color there yourself. Well, we get out on the boat to Rottnest most weekends. You still get out? Think my sailing days are behind me. Turned 40, you know. I loved watching you on the water, pushing yourself to the limit. You even sailed to Indonesia. You brought her? My wife? Yes, I did, Georgie. You brought your wife to your ex-wife's funeral. She's not coming to the funeral, but I didn't think there was any harm in bringing her here today. Seeing you girls, you know, seeing you... she always said you had her smile. Oh, God, I can see it now. Freshwater Bay, 1972. - Dad, don't. - Some university bash. - Dad, please. - She had a mauve cashmere sweater. I'm not reminiscing with you. - Her hair flying in the wind, - Stop! - like Faye Dunaway. - I said, stop. - I just want you to understand. - I refuse to understand. That's a very pleasing way to live your life, isn't it? Did you know it was 12 hours? No one found her for 12 hours. Well, you weren't there either, Georgie. Shared guilt's still guilt, Dad. - Well, I'm upset too. - Didn't say upset. - Did I say upset? - Come on, Georgie, let's... - Doesn't this all feel wrong? - Let's keep this civilized.

Truth is, I've probably got less responsibility than what you've got. And as for him...- ah, Foxes... always where you don't want them. - Always have been. - You knew them well, then? I never went after you, Georgie. I didn't even see you. I probably wouldn't have even noticed you if you hadn't come bounding up the beach that day to play with the kids. You fucked me the second day. You know what you saw in me? A ready-made family. A gap to fill. I thought you were in the business of filling it permanently. I don't know. I can deal with that.

Oh, thank you very much. So you think he's in the Coronation Gulf? I know he's in the Coronation Gulf. You realize how big the gulf is, don't you? Could take some time. Hello. Look familiar? Not to me. No, no, no. Have you seen this man? We've all been trying to work this guy out. You his sister? Or his missus? Fuck, are you Mrs. Buckridge? Buckridge? Can you take me where you left him? He wasn't stopping where I left him. Heading out to the gulf, I reckon. You're not coming. Not to the islands. Yeah, I got you where I needed to get you. You'll use a guide that I've set up for you out there. He's good. He's a fisherman mainly, but he knows the islands pretty well. What's this about, Jim? Whatever's in that tight head of yours, it might be better to say it. Yeah, you might not be right about that. I need to know why you're here. Um... well, Debbie was sick. She was badly sick. And I was, um... I was... Look, I'm not even going to try and excuse it, but she came to me, it wasn't the other way around. Who? Sal. Sal Fox. Darkie's wife. I don't know how he found out, but he... spat in my face, then he took a knife to me. Fucking no one takes a fucking knife to me. And, you know, I just... I just wanted to scare him a little, you know, give him a scare, but... we were both pretty drunk, and, um... when he left the bar, I followed him and his family. And he wasn't as in control of his vehicle as I was of mine, and he, um... well, he flipped it. Flipped it on the, um... one of the roads outside of town. And Beaver, Beaver was there. Beaver was going, "Fuck, fuck!" And, um... And there was this body there. There was a body had just, you know, been thrown out of the car and was just lying on the road. And Beaver was going, "We got to get out of here. You're over the limit, Jim. You don't want to ruin your life over this." Yeah, and we did. And, um... when I heard that... When I heard that that little girl... When I heard that that little girl could have lived if we'd, um... We drove away anyway. We've got some bad weather on the way. Yeah, I seen. White Point? Shit. I know it. Had me head kicked in at the pub when I was 19. You in fishing, then? Something like that. And now you're here. You know, for a couple of years, pilots have been saying they've seen a black fella up here. But those pilots like a story, and there must be 2,000 islands out there, so there's no way of proving he isn't out there somewhere. It is native land, isn't it? Yeah, and you couldn't fill a Japanese car with the amount of black fellas still have the bush skills to survive in this wilderness. And of that carload, most of them would be too old to walk or see anymore. What are you saying? I'm saying, you certain you want to look? Could be his corpse we find. Do you want to dance? No. Where are we looking tomorrow? Your guess is as good as mine, Georgie. Well, we're done for the day. One more. I want to find him too, Georgie. Your man promised me double if I did.
