(upbeat orchestral music) (sheep bleating) (cattle lowing) (rooster crowing) (dog barking) - Good day! - Oh, Sister Mary, I didn't hear you come in. - Have an accident? - No, thank you, Sister, we just had one. Is something wrong, Sister? - Well, I wanted you to be the first to know. The orphanage is in terrible trouble. - What kind of trouble, I mean, is it something I can help you with? - Oh, I only wish it were that simple, Mr. Raintree. But unfortunately, we need money. As you know, our mutual neighbor Mr. Fields holds the mortgage on the orphanage property, and since we can no longer make the payments, he's asked us to leave by the end of next week. - I guess he wants to own the entire valley. He's got my mortgage, too, he's already told me that if I'm even as much as one day late, he's gonna foreclose, matter of fact, I'm a little worried about this month myself. Is there something else I can do? - Well, make this coming Sunday very special for the children, you've always been so kind and so wonderful to them in the past. I only hope they'll remember your kindness. - Do the best I can, Sister. - Oh, I knew we could count on you again, Mr. Raintree. And God bless you. Oh, I must get back to the children. I'm playing shortstop this afternoon. (rooster crowing) (sheep bleating) (cattle lowing) - [Fester] Thank you, Sister Mary. (thudding) (fast electric guitar music) - Whatcha think, Billy? - Could be, Sheriff, but how we know for sure? - [Hortence] Calling the car, calling the car. Where are you? Well, goodness, Sheriff, you just sitting there, listening? The least you could do is answer me! If you're not gonna answer, I'm goin' home-- - Now, what about the fella we're lookin' for? - [Hortence] Well, he's been spotted 2 1/2 miles south of Pleasant Dooba, I was told he's just lyin' in the middle of the road, tryin to ride a hitch. - That's our man, Billy. - Let's go git him. (easy electric guitar music) - All right, on your feet, hippie. - Yeah, on your feet. I bet he's one of them smokers. I can tell by their little beady eyes. - Hey, what's happening, brothers? - How come he ain't running? - I don't know, how come you ain't running? - My feet hurt, besides, what'd I do? - What'd he do? - I don't know, what'd you do, boy? - When? - Wait a minute, if he don't know what he did, and we don't know what he did, how come we arrestin' him? - He must'a done something, that's why we're taking him in. Billy, put him in the car, and put that thing away, before you wind up shooting me, will you? (quiet piano music) (electronic warbling) - Hello out there! - This is Sheriff Dodd, who's this? - Guess, Sheriff. - Is that you, Claude Raintree? - No, Sheriff, it ain't me. (orchestral chiming) (clacking) Well, it did it again. (siren wailing) Fester, it's no time to play with the toys now. The Sheriff is coming. - He is? - Uh huh. Fester, I said the Sheriff is coming. - But Mr. Claude. (Fester giggling) Golly jeepers, Mr. Claude, look at that little guy. He ain't never done that before. (laughing) - Fester. - Huh? - It's upside-down. - Oh. (laughing) (birds chirping) (radio beeping) (radio beeping) (cattle lowing) (radio beeping) (sheep bleating) Mr. Claude. - Not now, Fester, I'm finished. - Okay, but what about all of these here? - Why should I bury all my toys? - 'Cause the Sheriff is coming. - Well, the Sheriff ain't after my toys, Fester. Now, put 'em back in the, oh! Hi, Sheriff! - Claude Raintree, you turn my radio back on! - I don't know what you're talking about, Sheriff. - You know dad-burn well what I'm talking about. Don't he, Fester? - Oh, he sure does, Sheriff, he knows all about it. Oops, ha ha. - Fester! - [Sheriff] All right. Where'd ya hide the gadget this time, Claude? - [Fester] Guess I did it again. - [Sheriff] What is all this junk? - [Claude] Just a bunch of harmless toys, Sheriff. Got kids coming. - [Sheriff] Think it's marvelous, eh? - Huh, what's happening? - [Sheriff] You don't know nothin' about it either, huh? - [Fester] I don't know nothin', Sheriff. - [Claude] Fester, ain't you got somethin' else to do? Fester! (radio beeping) - You better tell me. - It's right over here, Sheriff! But I didn't do nothin' to it, all I did was carry the toys out. - [Claude] Fester! (rooster crowing) (horse snorts) - Billy, check the radio and see if it's working now! - It's working, Sheriff! - Miss Millie. - Hello again, Sheriff. You know, I didn't get a chance to thank you for the lift you gave me. - Oh now, that's perfectly all right, Miss Millie. That's what good sheriffs are for. Say, y'all have to excuse me. I got some sheriffin' business to tend to. Hey, is it workin', Billy? - It's workin'. - If we were married, these things'd never happen. - You're right, if we was married, it probably would'a blowed up in my face. (cattle lowing) (birds chirping) (spy music) (birds chirping) - That's not fair, you're a mean man, Claude Raintree. (whirring) And I love you. - Do you hear that? - Well, of course, I said it. - That's one of my toys. - Please give me a kiss, Claude. Oh! - Millie, whatcha doin' on the floor? - You don't love me! - What's that got to do with sittin' on the floor? That is one of my toys, I can hear it calling me. (mysterious orchestral music) (whirring) Who are you? - I'm wherever I wanna be, man. Right now, I'm a kid playing with one of your toys. - Oh. Well, who said you could play with one of my toys? - Hey man, that's what toys are for, aren't they? - I guess you're right. Where'd you come from? - Who are you talking to, Claude? - I don't know. - Where'd I come from, man? (chuckles) Oh, where do birds come from? Or for that matter, the trees and the flowers? That's a heavy question, man. Before I could give you an answer, I'd have to think about it. - I didn't see him come in here, did you? - Me neither. - You see, there's a a sociological war going out there and it's ugly, so I guess I go where nature is. Where things are the way they should be and where beauty is still beautiful. And where clean is without materialistic certain. Now, this is an interesting object of nothingness. It is pure, man, and it's clean, and it's untouched. - He sure do talk funny. - Yeah. - Hey, what'd you do with all of these, huh? - Oh, once a month, I invite all the kids from the Clover Grove Orphanage to come by and I give each one of 'em a toy. - Orphans, huh? - Mm hm, all alone in the world, except for Sister Mary. I figure it's the least I could do. - I can dig it, man, I'm an orphan myself. - You think I'm doing the right thing? - Oh, yeah, man, you're doing the right thing! The world needs people like you. Hey, tell me something. I like to fix things, too, you know? So like tell me how you make these legs go forward and backward like that? - Come on over to my bench. (smooth jazz music) - [Billy] What's the matter, Sheriff? - He's gone! - Who? - I plum forgot about him. - What are you talkin' about? I ain't forgot nothin' all day, Sheriff. - He done run away, Billy. - Who are you talkin' about? - That city slicker fella, Billy, that hippie's done gone! - Sure enough! You're right, I bet he ran off while we was eatin'. What we gonna do? - I don't know. We ain't never lost a prisoner before, Billy. - Let's go get him! - Yeah. (smooth jazz music) (siren wailing) (cattle lowing) (rooster crowing) (hammer banging) - Fester, why do men talk so much? - Huh? - [Millie] Why do men talk so much? - Millie! - I don't know, Miss Millie. I always thought that women did all the talking. (sheep bleating) - Millie, I know you're here somewhere. So you don't have to hide. - I'm over here, Father. - Come on, show yourself, girl. (cattle lowing) Millie, show yourself before I get mad! - I'm down here, Father. - Oh, look, Millie, haven't you, oh! (bones cracking) Now look here, if I told you once, I told you a hundred times. I don't want you to keep my darling Millie out this late at night. - This late? - It's almost five-thirty. (rooster crowing) Dingbat, least you could do, Claude, is to marry her! - I'm Fester, you old goat! - Fester! (gasping) Well, well, well, she couldn't get the other young fool, so she's going after the dummy. What's your intention, boy? - Father! - You keep out of this, Millie! I'm gonna find out whether or not he's gonna marry you! - Yep, I'm willin'. - Fester, I'll do no such thing. - Millie, you stop and think about it. Go over there and get your horse, go ahead, get your horse. Why, you oughta be ashamed of yourself, youse! Come on, Millie! (sheep bleating) - Son of a gun, I almost had me a wife! (laughing) (sheep bleating) (cattle lowing) - [Claude] Millie! - I love you, Claude! - Hush up, you Jezebel, before you get into more trouble. (whimsical music) - What'd I do now? - I don't know. - What'd you do? - I wonder if I got engaged? (rooster crowing) - Fester, why don't you call it a day? - I think I'll call it a day, Mr. Claude. (Claude groans) (cattle lowing) * Sometimes how after you can go from the city * - What do you think of that? (smooth jazz music) I'm almost finished with it. - Hey man, you really gonna build one of these? - Sure, why not? - Yeah, why not? You know how to build this? - [Claude] I don't know, but what's the difference? - Yeah, what's the difference? - You wanna see what I got on the tool box? - You better believe it. - Hold it right there, we got you! - Yeah, we gotcha! - Now, why did you run away, boy? - [Billy] Yeah, how come? - I didn't, man, you got it all wrong. - What did he say? * All I got to do is love you - He said he didn't run away. - That's what I thought he said. Well, how did you get away? - Yeah, how? - I walked and I crawled. - Walked and crawled. He probably did, that son of a gun, and that ain't fair! - All right, boy, we're gonna take you in. So don't give us no trouble. - [Hippie] Anything you say, man. - What'd he do? - What did he do! - That is none of your affair, Claude Raintree. Now, this is sheriffin' business, and you just keep out of it, do you hear? All right, come on, we're taking you in, and don't you try to run away again. - Walk and crawl, Sheriff, walk and crawl! - Oh, will you shut up, and just put him in the car! And don't you say nothin', Claude Raintree. You're in enough trouble already! - What'd I do? (spy music) (toys rattling) - Hi. - Zeke! What are you doin' here? - Are you my daddy? - No, Zeke, I'm not your daddy. - Not even for pretend? - Okay, just for pretend. Won't Sister Mary miss you? - You won't send me back, will you? - You don't want her to worry, now do you? - No, but can I stay until they come? - Zeke, they're not comin' out 'til Sunday. - It's only three days from now, can I please stay? - Well, I have to call Sister Mary and see if it's all right. - What if she says no? - Then I'll have to take you back home. - That's not home to me, Mr. Raintree. This is more like home to me. - Here, why don't you play with this little fella, while I call Sister Mary? - I don't wanna go back, Mr. Claude. - We don't want her to worry, either, do we, now? - No, I guess you should call her. - Good idea. - Will you ask real nice-like? - [Claude] Oh, I'll be real nice. - Don't forget to say please. - I won't, I'll be real nice, and I'll say please, okay? - Okay, thank you, Mr. Claude. - Wanna come with me? - [Zeke] Okay. - Then you can stay. (soft acoustic guitar music) Yeah, Sister Mary, please. Sister Mary, Claude Raintree. That's what I'm calling about. Yeah, you don't have to worry, he's right here with me. What I wanna know, Sister, is would it be all right if he stayed out here with me 'til Sunday to kind of help me out? Oh, he won't be no trouble. Please? Well, he can make up that one day of school, couldn't he? Please? Oh yeah, that's fine, then he can stay, now? Yeah, you have a good evening, too, Sister. Nothin' to it, you can stay. - Yippee! - Come on. Don't forget to say your prayers, now, Zeke. Tomorrow I'll show you some of my new things, okay? - Our Father, thank you for this day. Thank you for Sister Mary not being mad. Thank you for my pretend daddy, Mr. Claude. Please watch over everybody, the animals, too, amen. Good night, Mr. Claude. - Good night, Zeke. (insects chirping) (birds singing) (clucking) (cattle lowing) (rooster crowing) - Zeke. Rise and shine, time for a new day. (rooster crowing) (cattle lowing) * There was once a man * A dreamer * No one listened to the words he had to say * * But for every girl and boy * There should be a special toy * * And a time to just be free and filled with joy * * Just a dreamer * A dream * So they passed him by, this dreamer * * Never understood the gift he had to share * * But the children knew him well * * And each of them could tell * That the toy man was a friend who really cared * * More than a dreamer, a friend * * Even dreamers wake from their dreaming * * And the world is strange and cold when you're alone * * You need someone there * That you can lean on * Two can face the world much better than just one * * Now the toy man * He's no dreamer * For his dreams are just as real as you and me * * And the children know it's true * * That no matter what you do * Live your dreams * And you'll be always filled with me * * Let the dreamer build their dreams * * Let the dreamer * Build their dreams * Let the dreamer build their dreams * (electric saw whining) (toy beeping and revving) - There he goes again. (tires squealing) That does it, that crazy fool has had it this time. (tires squealing) - Dad-burn it, Mr. Claude, there you go. He just went and did it again. (engine revving) (tires squealing) - What was that? - Must be one of them new foreign jobs. - [Sheriff] Yeah. - You've had it, Claude Raintree, and I'm comin' to get you! (truck hood banging) - Let's go get him. (upbeat rock music) (electronic warbling) (tires squealing) (electronic warbling) (tires squealing) (electronic warbling) (tires squealing) It's him again. - Who? - It's that Claude Raintree, and he's got us this time. - [Hortence] Calling the car, calling the car. Come on, Sheriff, I know you're out there. (electronic warbling) - [Hortence] This is the, calling for Sheriff Dodd. - Never can get anything done around here. - Will you shut your mouth. (grunting) - Yes, sure, but would you tell me what or who was driving our patrol car? - Claude Raintree, that's who. - Let's go get him. - Not on your life. I wouldn't go after that nut for all the money in the world. - Oh, Sheriff, he broke the law, didn't he? - That is sheriff's business, not the law. He didn't break the law, dad-burn it. I can't arrest him to taking control of my car. What would people think? And sit up! - Good morning, Miss Millie. - Where's Claude? (cattle lowing) (sheep bleating) - Well, I think he's out, I think he's out in the field. - Okay, thank you. (electronic warbling) - Hi. (electronic beeping) Sure makes you feel good to see a kid have fun with something you made. - That's a new one, ain't it? - Mm hm, I got lots of new things you ain't seen yet. I'll show you some of 'em in a minute. Hey, I'll even let you try one, okay? - Only if you think I should, but does it work? - Of course it works. Everything I build works, don't it? Well, 'most everything. Well, look at that remote car, it works, don't it? - Well, of course, but-- - No buts, perfection is what I go after, perfection is what I've achieved. Look at that little devil go. (revving) (electronic warbling) (tires squealing) (siren wailing) (tires squealing) (cattle lowing) - Well? Well? - Huh? - Where is he? - Who? - You know who! - No, but I might if you'd tell me. - You're idiots, the whole bunch of you. Raintree, where is Claude Raintree? - Oh, him, he's out in the field, playing with one of his toys, I guess. Why, do you want him? - I don't believe this, I don't believe this, not real! (rooster crowing) Maybe I'm losing my mind! - Well, if you do, Mr. Ched, and I find it, I tell you, I'll bring it over to you. (Ched crying) - Hi, Zeke. - Hi, Miss Millie, would you like to try this? - Sure! - Here, all you do is turn that on. Pull the little trigger down there. (revving) Show her how, hi, Ched! - Hi, Ched, first my lights started blinking, then they go out and I can't see, and then I bump my head, and all you gotta do is stand there and say, hi Ched? What are you trying to do, kill me? - Hi, mister, would you like to try this? - I ain't got time for that kind of nonsense, kid. - Well, can't you ever be nice? - A rich man hasn't got time to be nice. Otherwise, he wouldn't stay rich. - Don't you ever have any fun? - Yeah, I have fun, but I don't have fun climbing up that hill chasing this idiot, yeah, I have fun. I have fun collecting money from people, and when they don't get it up, I take their land, and soon I'll own the orphanage, and this farm, and this entire valley! - You don't own it yet. - Oh, but I will, and don't forget your mortgage payment is due next Monday, and no grace period, Raintree. Either you get up the money, or I put you out. What do you want, kid? - You're mean. - Yeah, I know, but look what I have. - What do you have? - Almost all the land in this valley. - Yeah, but you ain't got one of these. (electronic whining) (sputtering) - This is silly. (electronic warbling) (tires squealing) No wonder you're a failure, Raintree. - He ain't no failure. - He'll always be a failure, he'll be poor all his life. - Money doesn't always make you a rich man, Mr. Fields. - And I suppose this dumb kid stuff will. - Well, he's richer now than you'll ever be. - Yeah well, let me tell you something, Raintree. Money is the answer to everything. - Money itself won't make you happy, Ched. 'Cause you ain't a happy man. - [Ched] Well, genius, what else is there? - [Claude] Well, stick around. I'm gonna show my latest invention. - [Ched] Well, you don't have to show me nothin'. (spy music) (bird chirping) - I never tried this sort of thing before. (quiet orchestral music) (spy music) Well, what do you think? - Does it run? - Of course it runs. And I'll show you right now, come on, Millie honey. - Me, really, oh I can hardly wait! - See that little doodad there? Push that one in, you pull that little knob out there, when you turn on the key, stomp on the little thing on the floor there, and then you just put it in gear and take off. - Okay. - Pshew, this I gotta see. (electronic warbling) - This ain't got a chance. (electronic warbling) (Millie screams) (man yells) (birds chirping) (sheep bleating) (Ched laughing) - [Claude] Are ya all right, Millie? - Yeah. (cattle lowing) - Boy, you can sure drive, Miss Millie. (Ched laughing) - Well, genius, what else do you have? - My toys, I guess. And they do work, anybody can work them, even you. (bird singing) I must'a forgot to tell you something. - Yeah. - Yeah well, you'll have to show me. - [Man] (groaning) Oh, my head, oh. (birds chirping) - Whoo-ee, that little body sure does work, it's just like a tank. Well, I suppose I'm gonna have to fix that dad-burn barn door that Miss Millie just smashed. Let's see. That's four times this month. (hinges squeaking) I guess I better get started. (birds singing) (thumping) - Come on, Zeke, give me a hand. - Wow, that's neat, I really like this one. - Yeah, me too. - Oh Claude, that's wonderful. - That's a big deal? (spy music) (man yelling) - Whatcha doin', bud, bird-watching? - Oh no, no I was, I was just writing down the location of this lovely farm in the hopes that it was for sale. Is it? - Nope. It's never been for sale, either. And besides, you didn't wanna buy it anyway, did you? - Well, no, not exactly. - Shame, shame on you! You told Fester a lie, shame, shame. - Well, I'm Strange. - How strange? - No no, my name is Charlie Strange. - Oh, well, my name is Fester, bud, Fester McLong. - Well, howdy do? - I don't, besides, you ain't explained to me what you're doin' up here. - Well, uh, my car broke down. - Oh yeah, I know about that. See my trick knee, it's always... Go on. - Well, it was kind of mysterious. The engine stopped just like somebody had shut it off and I walked up the path and saw the mailbox and uh, here I am (chuckling). - Here you are, all right. What you doin', are you spyin' on Mr. Claude? - Oh, not really. - Well, you just come along with Fester. And you explain it to Mr. Claude. - What's that supposed to do, blow up? Haven't you got anything that, that really does something? - He's being mean again, Claude. - Yeah, I know, I have uh, I got some airplanes. - Airplanes, that's a big deal. You can buy those in the drugstore. - Not like these, here, lemme show you. - What's supposed to make that plane different from all the others? - 'Cause anyone, that is, anyone with the sense of a cow, can work one, here, let me show you. (electronic warbling) (Ched laughing) - Can I try it? - Zeke, if I can't do it, you sure can't. (buzzing) (adventurous orchestral music) (electronic warbling) (Ched laughing) - Ha ha, here, let me try that. (buzzing) (adventurous orchestral music) - I'll be dad-burned. (adventurous orchestral music) - Mr. Claude, I found this guy and he was up spying on the-- - Hi, I'm Claude Raintree. - Charlie Strange. - Mr. Strange, would you do me a favor? Just see if you can fly on one my airplanes? - Yeah. - Just turn it on and point it right at. - But Mr. Claude-- - Wait a minute. (buzzing) (adventurous orchestral music) - Mr. Claude? - Wait a minute, Fester. (airplane buzzing) I'll be dad-burned. - Fester, you see if you can fly one of my airplanes. Turn that on, point it right at it, and you see if you can make that go. Go ahead. (electronic warbling) Dad-burned, he can fly one. (adventurous orchestral music) (buzzing) (electronic warbling) (adventurous orchestral music) - Hi, Millie. Well, Claude, have you asked Millie to marry you yet? - No, sir, but I'm thinking about it all the time. - Thinking about it, thinking about it. - Do you think you could fly an airplane? - Fly an airplane. Why, I helped Wilbur and Orville put theirs together. Heh, watch this. (adventurous orchestral music) - I'll kill myself. - Good idea, sonny. - Not if I have anything to do with it. I heard what you said. - Huh, oh, I was only kidding. - What, about killing yourself, or marrying me? - Why, killing myself, of course. - Well, what about the other? - Millie, do we have to talk about it now? - Yes, Claude Raintree, right now. Or I'll never talk to you again! - Right out here in front of everybody? (cattle lowing) - [Millie] Come with me. - Hey, look at mine go! - [Fester] Look at mine, Jefferson. - Look out there, don't make it crash. Hey, Fester, how come you got holes in both sides of your barn? - [Fester] You wouldn't believe it, Jefferson. - [Jefferson] Well, try me. - Can we sit down, first? - Gonna be a long way, all right. Watch the planes. Easy. - (grunting) Jefferson! - What happened, what happened? - My trick knee went out. - Well, what's wrong, Claude? - I don't know, nothing, I guess. - Well, don't you love me anymore? - Of course I do. - Well then, when are we gonna get married? - It's that all you ever think about, is getting married? - Well, don't you know how long we've been going together? - A while, I guess. - A while, 12 years, Claude Raintree, count them, 12 years. And I tell you one thing, it won't be 13. - I'm sorry. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not, you don't love me anymore. - I've always loved you. - I might as well marry the sheriff, even if he is dumb. - Well, you go right ahead and marry him. - I will not! - Well, don't you threaten me, Millie Swickle. - I'll threaten you if I want to. - No, you won't, 'cause I refuse to listen to you. - Hey, Fester? - Huh? - You gonna fix that hole in the barn door? - Yup. - Would you like a little help? - Well, like I always say, Jefferson, two heads in the hand are better than one in the bush. (electronic warbling) - I oughta smack you right in the mouth for that. (laughing) Okay, all we got to do is get to our feet, if we can. - Jefferson, could you help me up, with my trick knee? - Oh, you and your gosh-darn knee, wait. Wait a minute, hold it, no. Watch the plane, watch the plane. Help, close that. (Fester yelps) What's the matter? - Well, you touched my knee, Jefferson. - I'm sorry, I'm trying to, I can't get up. (electronic warbling) How do you like that, that smartaleck? Picked me up, just like that. - Well, why won't you marry me, Claude? - Look, Millie, I raise a few cows, and I got a big mortgage, no one who raises a few cows with a big mortgage can afford a wife. - I knew it, you don't love me. - That has nothin' to do with it. - Well then, you're afraid. Well, I don't care how much money you have, Claude, don't you understand that? - Millie, I ain't got nothin'. The money I make from the cows goes into paying the mortgage and what little there is left over goes into making toys. Toys for kids who'd never see a toy if someone didn't make it for 'em. - Why don't you sell some of the things you make? - Sell my inventions, are you crazy, woman, who'd buy 'em? Besides, that's not why I make 'em. I make 'em... Oh look, Millie. My toys are good enough for kids that don't have to pay for 'em, but. Who'd buy me stuff anyhow? - Does that mean you're never gonna marry me, Claude, never? - Oh no, Millie, old man Simpson's gonna buy five cows from me this month, and with that money, I'll be able to make my mortgage payment and have a little left over to buy some gadgets for some toys and maybe even have some to put aside. But I promise you, if you wait for me, I'll make you the happiest woman you ever did-- - Wait, I won't wait for you Claude Raintree. I'm tired of waiting, do you understand that? - It ain't gonna take that long. - You told me that 12 years ago, and every year since then. Well, you can have your cows and your toys, 'cause I don't want you anymore! (rooster crowing) (cattle lowing) (birds chirping) (electronic warbling) - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Sorry. - I probably missed my broker by horsing around like this. But, what are you doing here? - My car broke down. - Oh yeah, well come on, I'll give you a lift. - All right. - Hey kid, here hold this. - [Zeke] Sure, Mr. Ched, did you have fun? - Well, I wasted a lot of time, if that's what you mean. Fun, that's all you people think about, is having fun, when you should be thinking about making money. Come on. (electronic beeping) (airplanes buzzing) (electronic warbling) Okay, Raintree, I'm leaving, and don't forget Monday, and don't be late. - Look at these toys! - You mean, all that junk? - Junk, these are the greatest toys I've ever seen. Did you make 'em? - Yep, why? - What do you do with 'em? - I give 'em away. - Either you don't know what you've got, or you're just plain crazy. - He's just plain crazy. - I don't think I'm either, if you're really interested, why don't you come back on Sunday, and then you tell me if you think I'm crazy? - Well, you can just count on that. Do we really have to leave? - Yeah, come on, let's get outta here. Oh, by the way, Raintree, I forgot to tell you, old man Simpson won't be buying any cows this month because as I understand it, a very, very, kindhearted young fellow just gave up some this morning at a much better price. Ha ha ha, I'll be seeing you, pal. Come on. * When you start your life * There's so much you won't know * (electronic warbling) - All right, that's fine, let's go. always making with those jokes, ain't you? - Jefferson. - Watch the plane. * Trust your heart to help you decide * * Do it with passion (toys pieces clattering) - Zeke, what have you done? - [Zeke] I'm sorry, I-- - Yeah. * Don't ever fake it - [Zeke] Are you mad at me? - Aw, Zeke, leave me alone, will ya, I just wanna be alone. (birds singing) (quiet acoustic guitar music) - I'm sorry, Claude. I'm so ashamed of myself, Claude Raintree. You should've slapped me in the face. - I'd never do that, Millie. I love you too much to ever raise a hand to you. - What do you want out of life, Claude? - I thought I knew this morning. I thought I wanted to make toys and make kids happy. Now I know I want more than that. I want to marry up with you someday, have kids of our own. - I'll wait for you, Claude. I don't care how long it takes, I'll wait. - It won't take long, Millie, I promise. (Millie sighs) - Who was that man with Ched? - I don't know. He sure was interested in my toys, strange kind of fella. He's gonna come back on Sunday. - How long do you think you'll keep little Zeke? - Why, I'd sure like to keep him forever and ever. - Yeah, he's such a cute little fella, I wish he were ours. - Oh my gosh, I forgot, come on. (quiet acoustic guitar music) - Are you all right, Claude? - Maybe it's the horse. - [Jefferson] All right, you got it, Fester? - I think so, Jefferson. - Good. (Jefferson yelling) Oh, what's happening? - I dropped it, I think. Oh yeah, that's what I did, Jefferson. (Jefferson groaning) Son of a gun, what do you think, Jefferson? - I don't know, Fester. Maybe we just better do it again tomorrow. - Are you okay? - I don't know, let's see. Yeah, yep, everything seems to be here. (rooster crowing) How about you? - The only thing that I'm missing is my speak. - Not only thing you're missing. - Listen, before my trick knee went out-- - Oh, your trick knee, your trick knee! I'm getting darn sick and tired of hearing about your trick knee. I done some pretty good things in my youth, too. I never finished telling you about the time when Wilbur and Orville and I put that airy-plane together, did I? - No, but if you've got a minute, I sure would like to hear. - All right. - And maybe Jefferson, I could tell you about one of my good times, which just might outdo one of your good times! - You're snide, McLong! - I'm Fester. - Huh? * Just think I'd find a home * 'Cause chasing your dreams * Will take courage and pride * Trust your heart to help you (rooster crowing) - Hey, where you been, girl? - She probably been horsing around out there in the fields, ha ha. - Don't say that about my daughter. - I told Claude I'd wait for him. - Well then, wait he'll have to do. Now, get back up on that horse, because we're going home. - [Millie] Yes, Father, but can't I kiss him good night? - No, not on your life, you can't. He said he'd wait, he's gonna have to wait. Now, get back up on that horse. - You tell her, Jefferson, boy, it sure does sound good to hear a daddy tell his young'uns how to act. - You tell it, heh heh. (laughing) Hey look here, I'll see you in the morning, and we'll put this door together. - Yes, sirree, Jefferson, we sure will do that. - Okay, oh, easy, easy. - I love you, Claude! - [Jefferson] Oh hush up, girl! You got lots of time for that, after the bum marries you. * Do it with passion * Do it for you - Whatcha doin', Zeke? - Nothin'. - Did you get it fixed? - You yelled at me and you don't want me around anymore. - I was upset. Grown-ups sometimes do that, Zeke. They sometimes say things they don't even mean. * Never give up, never give in - Wanna talk about it? - No. - Okay. - You wanted me to leave you alone, and you haven't said you changed your mind. * Now get out there and give it your best try * - Zeke? - What? - I'm sorry, Zeke, I'm sorry I raised my voice to you. Forgive me? - You mean that? - I mean it. - Okay, daddy. - Daddy? - You said I could pretend, didn't you? - So I did. You know something? - What? - Sounds kind of nice. Let's see if we can fix this. * Me and you * Just we two * Never felt so glad being alive * * Do you feel it too * Lazy day * Time just slips away * Open things to grow * Taking it easy * Let's do it always * Wakin' bold * Sliding down the hole * Swinging from the trees * Saying the Tarzan * And we're never gonna part * Let's pretend it's real * We can say that we're a family * * Let's pretend there's no one in the world * * Who'll be taking you away from me * * Living things * Why, amusing things * Making toys that fly * Making kids happy * We can do most anything * You and me * I wish that it could be * But for now let's just keep on pretending * * That's good enough for me * Let's pretend it's real * We can see that we're a family * * Let's pretend there's no one in the world * * Who'll be taking you away from me * * We can make it real, oh * See how dreams come true * And there won't be anyone at all * * Who'll taking me away from you * * We can make it real * Let's be a family * There won't be anyone at all * Who'll be taking you away * Taking you away from me (insects chirping) (cow mooing) (rooster crowing) - Okay, we got it, now let's see what we get over here. Yeah, we got, what number you got over there? - One. - One what? Oh darn it. Must'a got slipped back in here, gotta get closer. (Claude yawning) - Jefferson, it's your fault. - Don't tell me it's my fault. (rooster crowing) - Hey. (Jefferson and Fester talking at once) Zeke. - [Fester] It is your fault. - Rise and shine. - [Jefferson] Pig-headed baboon. - There's little numbers on this end. - Well, I know-- - And there's big numbers on this end. (cattle lowing) (rattling) - You're the most exasperating person I ever met. - Huh? - That's a one-syllable conversation, gimme the hammer. I wanna hammer this big nail in over here. Come on, let me have the hammer, please. Oh! - What's that? - What's what? - That. - Oh, that, that's my new television tuning device. - How does it work? - Wanna see, I'll show you, turn this on, that that on, turn that in and watch. (upbeat rock music) (electronic warbling) - This is the final straw, Billy, this does it. - What's happening, Sheriff, how come you stopped the car? - [Sheriff] Going after him. - [Billy] What are you talking about, who? (cattle lowing) (thudding) - Claude Raintree, you idiot. - Oh, yeah. When we going after him? - Soon as the car starts running again. (electronic warbling) - Oh hi, Millie. We're watching roller skating on the TV. - What's this? - That's my brand-new doodad. - What does it do? - I ain't quite sure, but it works. (rooster crowing) - Yep, Jefferson. - Yeah, you're right, we missed it by at least three or four feet. - You know what? - What? - It was my fault, I measured wrong, Jefferson. - Fester, you're a big man for admitting your mistakes. I told you I wasn't wrong. Hey Fester. - Huh? (sheep bleating) - Who's that old lone dude that's spying on us from way out yonder? - Does he have a blue suit on? - Yeah. - Then it's that Strange fella. - Strange fella? - Charlie Strange. - Oh, Charlie Strange. - Jefferson. - What? - Do you know what'd be a good idea? - I know what'd be your idea of a good idea. That maybe we go over and scare the pants of him? (laughing) Oh, that's right in. (sheep bleating) - Okay. - Let's go. (smooth jazz music) (thudding) (whimsical music) - Will you put that thing away, before you kill somebody? - But I-- - No buts, I said put it away. We came here to arrest him, not to kill him. Now you go that way, and I'll go, no. You go this way, and I better. You better stay with me. - Can't I shoot it just one more time? - Put it away! - Aw, I never have a chance to have any fun at all. How come you always get to make the decisions? - Because I am the sheriff, and I make sheriff decisions. And you are a deputy, and deputies never make decisions. Never, do you understand? - No, but-- - What'd you say? - I said... Let's go git him! - You're out of uniform again. (spy music) - Gotcha this time! - You ain't gettin' away this time, fatso. (whimsical music) - How come you ain't runnin', bud? - 'Cause, 'cause I'm pooped. (laughing) - Did you hear that, he's pooped. We done pooped the young pup, huh? - They sure don't make 'em like they used to, Jefferson. - No, they don't. - You know something, before my trick knee-- - Never mind your trick knee, I still don't trust this dude. - Me neither, Jefferson. - I'll do whatever you want me to. - You bet you will. - Yeah, we're gonna turn you in, mister. - You come on us with, we're taking you to Mr. Claude. (whimsical music) - Let's get outta here, Billy. (whimsical music) (siren wailing) (laughing) - Whoo, look at 'em go! - My name is Charlie Strange, I'm from WBH Toys. And I'd like to talk to you. - What about? - Well, I never-- - Mr. Claude, we caught him snooping. - That's right, Claude, we caught this big fat sneak. - What was you looking for, Mr. Strange? - Well, as I said, I want you to design toys for us. And, could we go somewhere we can talk in private? - Sure, come on into my office, excuse us. - Idiot. (sheep bleating) - Sit down, Mr. Strange. - Ah. Mr. Raintree, what do you want most in life? - Do you mean for me, personal, or for the whole world? - No no, for you, personal. - Guess I wanna marry up with Millie, she's my girl, and maybe have some kids and own my own land. - What about fame and security? With money, you could travel, buy whatever you wanted. - That's not too important to me, I guess. - Well, it should be, a man with your talent should have wealth and position. - What are you leading up to, Mr. Strange? - Well, uh, Claude, I've been watching... Our company has been watching you, and we think your toys are fantastic, the best in the whole world, and we'd like you to design toys for us. - Oh now, you gotta be joshing. I never make two of the same thing. And most of them don't work. - We'll make it well worth your while. - I don't know... - Think of the money. - Could I think on it a while? - Well, I suppose so, but I, we'd like to know as soon as possible. - Sure, excuse me. (children yelling) - All right, youse guys, now listen up. - Well, here we are again, Mr. Raintree. You think you're up to it? - As always, Sister Mary, it's a day I look forward to. - Well, how's little Zeke? - He's fine, sure has been a big help to me the last few days. - Oh really? - And I don't want any of youse to force me to enforce any pressure on you. And another thing-- - Okay, come and get it kids! (children cheering) - Bupkis, must have been bupkis. - Yes ma'am, if I ever have a son, I want one just like him. - Oh. - Claude, Claude, little Zeke is gone! - [Claude] Gone, what do you mean? - I looked everywhere and he's gone! - Where, how long ago? - Well, I don't know, he was right next to me and the next thing I knew, he was gone! - He's probably hiding so he won't have to go back to the orphanage with us. - Don't worry, Sister Mary, I'll find him. He couldn't have got too far. - I'll call the Sheriff, maybe he can help us. - What about the other children, Mr. Raintree? - You just go ahead and pass out the toys, and I'll be back as soon as I can to show them how they work. - Oh, you know how they work? - I'll be back just as soon as I can. - That's what I figured. (whimsical music) (adventurous orchestral music) - Do you know who that was? - No I don't, who was it? - The lone Raintree. (laughing) (adventurous orchestral music) Jefferson, what do you think? - I don't think it looks sturdy enough, Fester. But probably keep out the early morning dew. Come on, let's lift her up and try to fit her in here. Let's see if we can get her, one good, it's too heavy, I can't move it. Here, I got an idea, you give me a little slack on the rope. I'll put a wench on her, and we'll pull her up on the wench, there we go. All right, give me a little more slack now. Atta boy, keep it coming, keep it coming, a little bit more. Atta boy, Fester, just a touch more. There we go, okay, I'll come around there and I'll help you with it, here, let me get ahold of it. We got it here, all right, let's pull it now. One, two, pull! (whimsical music) There, oh look what we've done! We chewed up the whole ground. (crying) - Zeke! - [Hortence] This is the radio calling for Sheriff Dodd. - Hey, what's happening, man? - Hm, who was that, I thought I heard something. - [Hortence] This is your last chance, Sheriff. Then I'm gonna pull out all these wires and go home. Calling the car, do you hear me? - What is it, Hortence, I'm busy. - [Hortence] Doing what? - Sheriffin' business, that's what! What else would I be doing? - [Hortence] Quitting, that's what. - Ha, she's tough, baby, I can dig her. - What do you want, Hortence? - [Hortence] I forgot. You gotta get out to Claude Raintree's farm right away. - I ain't goin' back out there. - [Hortence] But you gotta, Sheriff. A little boy's run off somewheres and they can't find him. - Now look, Hortence, you see, what I got to do is escort this hippie to the county line. That's the least I can do since I arrested him for nothing. - [Hortence] What about that little boy, Sheriff? You've gotta help! - I ain't goin', Hortence, and that's final. Now send another car! - [Hortence] What other car? You're in the only car we have. - Oh, all right, Hortence, all right, I'm on my way. - Hey, all right, I can dig seeing him again. He has a good head. (children chattering) * I got my place (children chattering) - Amazing! He's got to make toys for us, he's got to! - Wait, let's get this straight. Gotta get it straight over there. No no, no no no, wait, wait, wait, oh my hand, my hand, you got my hand caught, you got my hand caught. (rooster crowing) Get, get the, oh, yes. - Jefferson, I asked if you could give me hand. (laughing) - Little Zeke, are you in here, answer me! (siren wailing) (adventurous orchestral music) (electronic buzzing) (electronic warbling) (electronic buzzing) (children chattering) (electronic warbling) (whimsical music) - Where's Raintree? - What, I don't know. - Oh, wait'll I get my hands on him! - Zeke! (birds chirping) You out there, Zeke? (birds chirping) Zeke, you don't have to be afraid, son, I understand. Zeke, are you out here? - [Zeke] No. - Come on out, Zeke, come on. That wasn't very nice of you to run off like that. You want Sister Mary to think I didn't treat you nice? - No, but I don't wanna go back to the orphanage. - Maybe you won't have to. - But I don't want, what'd you say? - Well, I've been thinking, what Fester so busy and all, and all that work to do, I sure could use another hand to help me, do you think you'd be interested? - Yes, sir! - You have to promise never to run away again. - Oh, not ever. I love you, Mr. Claude, I love you. - You know something, Zeke? - What? - I love you, too. Come on. (children chattering) (electronic buzzing) (electronic warbling) (whimsical music) (Ched laughing) (hammer banging) - Jefferson. - Huh? - Would you hit the nail? (hammer thumping) (Fester yelling) - Well what, you told me to hit your nail, didn't you? Oh, all right, all right, all right, I'll fix it. Oh, you got the boo-boo, here. How's that, better? (electronic warbling) Hold this thing the right way, tThere. - You hit my nail one more time. - Well, hold it with the other hand. - Then you'll hit the other hand! - Well, two hands in the bush is worth one caught in there! Are you gonna cooperate with me? - Huh? (electronic warbling) - Hey man, you oughta be arrested for reckless driving. (children chattering) - Hi, Mr. Strange! - [Charlie] Hi! - Can I see you inside a minute, please? - [Charlie] Oh sure. - Thank you. (children yelling) Zeke, you gotta just sit up there a minute, okay? Study this. Mr. Strange, what it is exactly you want me to do? - We want you to design toys for us. Now, there'll be usual advance, of course. And we'll supply with whatever you want or need. What do you want or need? - What do you mean by an advance? - Well, 25,000 to start. - 25,000. Dollars? - 50. - 25,000 dollars. - Then of course, we'll put you on salary with a bonus, an expense account, a secretary, office equipment. - 25,000 dollars. That's more'n enough to pay for my mortgage. And orphanage's, too. - Yes, we'll take care of that. - Could I work right here? - You can work in London, New York, Tahiti, any place you want to. - 25,000 dollars. (whimsical music) (Ched laughing) - You sure make it sound good, Mr. Strange. Hope it turns out that way. - Oh, it will, welcome to WBH Toys. From now on, everything you create will bear the WBH trademark. Instead of making just a few children happy, you'll make millions of them happy. - You won't forget about that other little thing now, will you? - Oh, the trust fund, oh no, sir. From now on, 10% of your salary will go to the Clover Grove Orphanages. 15% to orphanages all over the state. And just to show you that my heart's in the right place, there will be similar funds set up for orphanages all over America, now I've got a lot to do tomorrow, so I must be running along. - So soon? I haven't shown you my special night sky lighter yet. - Oh, I'll see everything that you make. ]Now, in spite of what appears to be a sour countenance, I love to see children laugh, ha ha. Now I must be running along. - Bye. - [Zeke] What is this? - Oh, that's my whatchacallit. - What's it do? - I don't know. (quiet country music) - Hey, man, that is a gas. - Where's Claude Raintree? I think I'll break every bone in his head. (children chattering) Look at all them kids, look at them toys. Follow me, let's take a closer look. - May I have a word with you? - Sure, Sister Mary. - Zeke, why don't you go outside and play with the others, while I have a word with Mr. Raintree? - Yes, Sister Mary. - Would you like to sit down? - No, no thank you. I have something very important I want to ask you. I wonder if you would consider, well-- - Sister Mary, what would I have to do to keep little Zeke with me forever? - Why don't you adopt him? - Yeah, that's what I wanna do, I wanna adopt him. - Oh, that's wonderful! Of course, there's one small problem. - Can I help you, Miss Millie? - Oh no, thank you, Sheriff. Claude'll be out in just a minute. - He will? - Yeah, oh by the way, the little boy, he's been found. - Well, doggone it, I'm right glad to hear that. I'm so glad that they found him. (thudding) Where is Claude? - No, he's in the barn! He's getting ready to show everybody his newest invention. - When? - Right away. - I'll see you later, Miss Millie. - Why, Sheriff, don't you wanna see Claude's newest creation? - [Sheriff] Billy, come on, Billy. Let's go, come on, before everybody else. Let's get outta here! (whimsical music) Billy! (whimsical music) - Hey, little missy, do me a favor, will you? (cattle lowing) Would you give this peace medal to your friend Claude? - Would you like me to get him for you? - No, you don't have to bother doing that. You see, I gotta split, I just want you to tell him thanks. I've been kicking around for about three years, trying to find some happiness, honesty, love. Finally came to find it right here, with your friend Claude. And I think I'm gonna go out and try to find some of my own. You just tell him his head is on straight. You gotta keep it that way, hear?. Peace. (whimsical music) (peaceful orchestral music) - Hi. - Hi. - What's that? - A peace medal. - I know it's a piece of metal, but what is it? - Oh, that hippie-looking fellow out there, he gave it to me to give to you, and he said, thanks, that your head was on straight, and that he had to split. - Split what? - I don't know. - Millie. You still wanna marry up with me? - Well, of course, Claude, why? - Could we do it right away? (wedding organ music) - Did you say what I thought I heard? Oh, I think I thought what you said. I thought I heard, or did I? Oh, Claude, I love you! (wedding organ music) Oh Claude! - Does that mean yes? - Yes! (hammer banging) (cattle lowing) - Jefferson, gimme the hammer. - Huh, oh, all right, here you go. Do you ever think about joining up with the little league? - Huh? - Ah, ha ha, get over here. - Listen, Jefferson, before my trick knee went out, I was known as Lightning Fester McLong. (Fester and Jefferson talking at once) - You stopped trucking a long time ago, Lightning, with your trick knee. - You two do this all by yourself? - Yep, sure thing, didn't we, Fester? - We sure did, Mr. Ched. Jefferson and I built it ourselves and we put it up, too. - Yep. Hey, take your arm off her, you young whippersnapper. Before I'm forced to use something that I might be sorry for. - It's all right, Father, we're getting married. - Oh. (rooster crowing) Fine thing I didn't punch him first and ask questions afterwards. - Is this thing safe? - Why sure, it's safe, go ahead, try it. - All right. (Ched yelling) (barn door thudding) - Ya all right, Ched? - Someday I'm gonna kill that man! - Hey Ched, you wanna stick around? I'm gonna show my latest invention. - No, thank you, Raintree. You're not gonna kill me with any more of your crazy stunts. But I'll see you tomorrow, and don't forget your mortgage payment. - Oh, I'll be ready, Ched. In fact, both Sister Mary and I'll both be ready and waiting first thing in the morning. You have a nice evening now, Ched. (cattle lowing) (laughing) - I wonder why he seems so happy. (sheep bleating) - Jefferson? - Yeah? - Did you see the look on his face when the door came down on him? - Yeah. (laughing) - Well, what do you think, Millie? Ready to show the kids my latest invention? My new instant rainbow maker, come on. (wood clattering) - Jefferson. - Yeah. - How about a nip from the old bottle? - You better not let that trick knee of yours hold you up or I'll walk right over you. Come on, let's go. - Y'all having a good time? - [Children] Yeah! - [Claude] Wanna see some more? - [Children] Yeah! - [Claude] Wanna go home and go take a nap? - [Children] No! - I was gonna show you my special night sky lighter, but Sister Mary pointed out that you couldn't see it during the daytime. So instead of that, I'm gonna show you my brand-new invention that I just finished today. This is called an instant rainbow maker. Now what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna turn it on. You wanna hold that, Millie? And when I press this button, you gonna see an instant rainbow that's gonna cover the whole sky. So you just look straight up in the air, okay? Wanna see it? - [Children] Yeah! - Okay. - You know something, this is pretty good stuff. - Sure is, Jefferson, I made it myself. Who turned the lights out? - Did they catch us already? (explosion booming) (cattle lowing) - Thank you for everything. Oh hurry, children, let's all get in the truck before the sheriff gets here and busts Mr. Raintree. (Fester crying) - Fester, what's the matter, what's the matter? Fester, why are you crying? - Because my barn door fell down. - Oh. - Yeah (sobbing). - Don't be a crybaby. - But my barn door fell down. - I know, I know, but we can put it back up tomorrow. There's nothing to worry about. - Come on now, hurry up, hurry up, let's go. - Bye. Bye. - That's it, line up, children, hurry up. That's it, that's it, come on, come along. Good, good. Oh! - [Zeke] Good bye, Sister Mary. (electronic warbling) - God bless you, Zeke, and you be a good boy now, you hear? Okay. (birds chirping) (thudding) (engine stalling) (banging) - Bye bye. - Bye bye. - See you next Sunday, now. - [Children] Bye! - Sure is peaceful out here, ain't it. - Sure is, Claude. - Jefferson. - What? - I wonder what the Sheriff would say about us drinkin'? - Well, what are you worried about? You're as old as your fingers and your toes put together, ain't you? - Yeah. * Toys toys, toys toys, toys toys, toys toys * - 27. - Never seen him with his shoes off, maybe he's right.
