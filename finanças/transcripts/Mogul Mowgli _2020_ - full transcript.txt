Yeah, yeah, yeah...! Yeah, big up, big up, big up. London gang here, too. All right, make some fucking noise! Yeah. We're back. It's a candle business. And for every candle someone buys, we fight a house in Pakistan. - I need to talk. Dante's people are here. - Did you know about fucking RPG here? What the fuck is he doing in New York? Fuck RPG right now. You didn't hear me. No, I didn't. Did you hear me? Dante fucking Smith wants you to open for him in Europe. - Dante Dante? - Yeah, Dante Dante. Oh...! Yes! We start next week. - Next week? - We start next week, yeah. Next week? - What, you got plans or something? - No, I'm just... No, it's cool, I'll make it work. - I'll make it work. - Cool. Oh, I can't breathe. Dante Smith, huh? Exciting. Yeah, it's pretty sick. He said it's gonna start in London, the tour. So, you gonna leave early, go see your family? Are you trying to get rid of me? Well, I thought I'd chill... chill with you. - What...? What? - What? - What's up? - Nothing's up. Yeah, something's up. You were chatting to that dickhead rapper all night. - What's going on? - Oh my God, what is wrong with you? - What? - Why are you so insecure? How am I insecure? This is, like, my big night, and you're just... you're just chatting to next man. I don't understand how much more attention you want. Everything is about you. I mean, you've got a hundred people back there on your dick. OK, well, I just wanted to chill with you. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. No, you don't, cos you're... you're about to run off again. OK, you know, that's not running off, that's called my job. Going on tour is my job. Look, a day, a week, it's not gonna make a difference to us. What do you mean, "a difference"? What... I'm saying, nothing's gonna change here. I want you to go off and do your thing. But I don't want to have a relationship on FaceTime. There we go, that's it. OK, just say it.

We'll find out. What are you up to? I'm just clearing away this junk, man. - Can we please throw it away? - Are you crazy? Throw it away? Vinyl cassette stores are all over Brick Lane. We can still corner the market. I know for a fact you haven't even opened half of them because it's still got all the wrapping around it. Yeah, well, maybe if you had hung around I would have, right?

Nah, I got my period. Yeah, every Ramadan, innit, you're on your period. - Yeah, same here. - Yeah, exactly. She gonna bad you up, you know? - All I'm saying is... - Bilal! That's enough. Every time she's hitting me. - And I hit her back, she starts crying. - Why are you hitting her back? But the thing is, men can't defend themselves no more, bro. That's the problem. Feel my hand. Bruv, I know what you do with your left hand. See that? Soft. - What you been doing with it, bruv? - Nothing, bruv. And you know what, the generation after us, gonna be even softer. Start naming your kids Daniel and Adam. So, you want to pick a fight here, too? Rubina bajhi. All I'm saying is, nobody's calling him Daniyaal, are they? They're calling him Daniel. I just want to know something. What are you going to call your son? - Ashfaq. - Oh, Bilal! You're joking. Bruv, you're taking the piss. You're gonna call him Arse-fuck? Bruv, that's child abuse. He's got enough problems, do you know what I mean? - Think about it. - Get a nickname, its better. Listen, everyone ends up with nicknames in this country. If you get Bob, Tim, Dave, why can't you have Zed and Arse as well? - Oh, yeah, right. - See what I mean? - We can do nicknames, as well. - You, you're just bare Haram, innit? So you keep to your Haram ways because you sound castrated. - What? - Your name is not Zed, it's Zaheer, bro. And the moment you realise that, things will be better for you, innit? OK, listen, you know, I know my name is Zaheer. But I've got the confidence to just put my little twist on it without crying about it. I'm confident as well. I'm not crying about it. All I'm saying is, that's not your twist, innit? That's what they gave you. They called you Zed. But now I call me Zed. And I call you dickhead. Why don't you respect the name that I gave you as your elder. Because you know what? You're not seeing, yeah, why our parents... You're not seeing why our parents fought for our names. You went to America, and it all got to your head, do you know that? Abu, you need to tell him, tell him about it. Cos these are the people that gave us our names, innit? I'm proud of my name, I don't know about you, though. But tell him. Once skinheads chased me from school. Oh, I love this one. - Look at the scar, look. - I know! I took a cricket bat once and put up a fight. Wasn't it a hockey stick last time? The Bengalis always ran. Abu, you're always picking on Bengalis. Why you trying to be woke for, man? I was with him until he started getting racist himself, innit? That's enough. That's enough now. We just broke our fast and this is what we're talking about? Bashir, you've seen some crazy shit. Tell him how you fled India. I don't remember it. You forgot the train ride to Pakistan? The bloodshed, massacres, come on! It's not like I saved anyone. I just hid under layers of clothes. They need to know about Partition. Leave my station alone. Sometimes they play my son's music. As if they play his music. How would you know? I like hearing my son's songs. You like gloating to the famiy. Someone has to. Straighten the lines, brothers. Amiyn. 'Heard anything from Bina?' No. - No, she hasn't texted me. - 'OK. 'Choreography, what are we doing about it?' - No. No. - '10,000 people, Zed.' Vaseem, I'm not a Spice Girl. Vaseem, man, I can't. 'No one's gonna want you standing still. This is not poetry slam.' Think of something else, then, man. 'Zed.' Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. 'You should be spending money for this. I just think you should consider it.' - Well, no, just something... anything else. - 'Can I book you in for this guy or not?' No, we don't need him, man. 'You don't have do what they say. You can just put your own twist on it.' Yo, I had an idea for this new banger. I think it's gonna kill it. 'Oh, really? So, when can I hear it?' - Yo, Vaseem, let me call you back, yo. - 'No. No, no. - 'Don't put the phone down on me, Zed.' - Yeah, one minute. I'll call you back. Wait. I thought it was you. Bro, I'm a huge fan, bruv. I saw you inside. - Bro, is it cool if I take a selfie? - No, bro. Sorry. - I'm just not doing that right now, man. - What's that, man? Can I? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Bro, you can't roll for shit, man. - I know. I know. I know. Very safe, yeah? - Bro, it was good meeting you, man. - OK, yeah. Perhaps just before I go, some quick advice, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Next time when you hand your brother something, just do it with your right hand. It's Sunnah. What you chatting about? It's Sunnah bro, if you hand it with your right hand. This is haram. It doesn't fucking matter what hand I give it to you with. - Bro, it's not haram, bro. - It is. - No, bro. - No, it is. Bro, it's not haram, bro. It's not cool. It's frowned upon, but it's not a sin. But it is a sin to call something a sin that's not a sin. All right, man, let's take the selfie, yeah? No, no, no, bro. Sorry, man, I can't... can't take any selfies. You know, I was just looking out for you, innit? Oh, yeah, yeah. No, no. I just... I've gotta get back to my phone call, man. That's all right, bro. I understand. I'll just wait, man. You can bounce, man. It's cool, bro. I'll wait, man. Well, bruv, it was good to meet you, man. It was good to meet you. Thank you, for real, man, but you can bounce now. You can bounce. Bounce. It's not a sin. To say it's a sin is a sin. - This is the problem with you Pakis. - What? You get a bit of fame, and you turn into fucking coconuts. What? What the fuck did you call me? - Coconut. - How the f... Yo, how the fuck am I a coconut, man? Yo, you know me, or you heard any of my lyrics. I heard your lyrics, man. What I don't get, bro, is why the fuck are you out here, not praying with your brothers inside, RPG? I'm not RPG. - Oh, shit, you're the other guy. - Get the fuck out of my face, man. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing, bruv? Take it back, man. Fuck. Are you OK? I'm sorry, bro. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, bro. Let me help you up. Get off! Where's Zaheer? Zaheer? Zaheer? What are you doing? I told you I don't want to come. Have you seen the look of that man? He looks like a clown. It's opening night I need... You like rap music, right? Think of this as our rap. Come on, sweet cheeks. - Do it for me. - Why? - Come on! Come on! - Why? Why? This is all for you. Boy! People pay attention. They drew a line in the sand. India and Pakistan. East and West. Us and them. I was born from this rupture. And I am the sickness from this separation. I am Toba Tek Singh! Toba Tek Singh! Toba Tek Singh! Toba Tek Singh...! Toba Tek Singh! Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh...! Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh...! Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh...! Zaheer! Zaheer! He's up. Thank God! Bilal, tell the nurse! What happened? A nice boy found you in the alleyway. Is that what happened? How are you feeling? Zed, I got your phone. It's a bit smashed up. He doesn't need his phone now. Yo, bro, can you bring me up, please? I called them. They're coming. - Have you warded off the evil eye? - I did the peppers. - Any smell? - None. There's a very strong evil eye on him. That's not how you get rid of the evil eye, you know. - Why not? - Bilal, shut up. It's all superstition. There's nothing in the Quran and Sunnah about peppers. What are you talking about? It's about progress, every time. Enough. Want some water, son? It's so itchy. - There you go. - Thank you. All right Now, I don't want to alarm you, Mr Anwar, but from the scans we've done, your muscles seem to be weakening. So what is that? Like, is that a stroke? It could be a number of things. We need to run some more tests to determine what course of action is best. OK. So I can stop by in a couple of weeks, get those done? I got a tour that starts in less than a week. Um, let's just try a couple of things, shall we? - Uh-huh. - OK. Now, I'm going to put my hand here. I want you to lift your leg, and I want you to push against my hand. OK? - OK. - Push against it. Hard as you can... hard as you can. Keep pushing. OK. Same thing on the other leg, OK? Hard as you can. Now, let's try the arms. I'm going to apply pressure here. I want you push against me. Push. Push. Now, I'd like you to stand up for me, please. - But I'd like you to cross your arms like this. - Uh? One more time. - We need to monitor your progress. - Sorry, how did this happen? The scan shows no sign of brain injury or fall. - It could be degenerative. - What does that mean? Does that mean it's going to get worse? Let's get a biopsy underway and take it from there. - Now... - Sorry, can I just stop you? I really can't miss this tour. I genuinely cannot miss it. OK, let's make a deal. If you can walk from that chair to that lift without any assistance, I'll discharge you. How's that sound? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - OK. Thank you.

Feeling better? I prayed on the water. - If you need anything... - Thank you. Well, you were just in the area, yeah? - What the fuck, Zed? - Yeah, - What happened? - Nothing happened, man, I swear. I swear, it's nothing. - They're saying it could be serious. - It's... - I'm gonna be out of here by tomorrow, man. - You should've fold me. They're overreacting. And don't you fucking start, too.

What's going on? - RPG's willing to take the slot. RPG? Fucking Abdul Latif Tariq? - What the fuck? - Zed... We made a pay-out to Dante's people. We need to fill the slot. If not, we're going to lose all the money. What money? I thought he wanted me on the tour. Yeah, of course he does. But we had to pay him to make it happen. They said they'll RPG as a replacement just to cover the cost. Yeah, it makes sense, man. You're right, man. I've been working for this for only, like, 15 years. My mum still works in Lyfelds fucking grocery store. Let's give it to Mr Pussy Fried fucking Chicken. - You're his favourite rapper. - Well, he's not mine. - Literally, just give him a break. - Why?

Let's just pause. I am going to get the results in, like, a day. Let's wait for the results. You think I don't want you to make this tour? I'm not fucking sure anymore, mate.

We got the results from your biopsy, and we can start building a picture of what's going on. OK. With your rapid weight and muscle loss, we can confirm it's a muscle-related autoimmune condition. Your white blood cells, which protect you, are attacking your muscles and organs. Your body can't recognise itself, so it's attacking itself. OK, so what do we do? Since this is a chronic condition, there isn't a cure. Now, we think you're a good candidate for this experimental therapy that can manage the illness. OK, so when can we get started? I've got a tour that starts pretty soon. Well, I can look at available... This experimental therapy, what about the risks or side effects? It's a stem cell infusion. The symptoms are similar to chemotherapy. There is also a risk of permanent infertility. We recommend you freeze your sperm at the fertility clinic before the procedure begins. Why is this happening? I wish I could give you an answer. Most auto-immune diseases have a hereditary component. And what about an alternative? When could, um.. when could we start this experimental... We can start tomorrow. I suggest you talk it over with your family... Thank you. ...and make your decision soon. Ridiculous.

They're gonna do this experimental shit on me, all right? What, the one that's going to make you sterile? I spoke to your mum upstairs. You gonna do it? What is he doing here? He just wants to talk to you, OK? Oi. Listen... I know what you think of me... but I'm just here to say, man, we're the same. The first verse I ever learned was Zed verse, your verse. I used to record that shit over a cassette. So... really, if you think about it, you know, if, like, I'm going on tour... it's like you going on tour, man. It's the same. It's the same thing. Better if I'm on tour, though. Then, I'd really be on tour. If I'm on tour, then I'm on tour. It's the cycle. Its like there's no... There's no Drake without Whoopi Goldberg. Do you know what I mean? Like, there's no Nelson Mandela without apartheid. No apartheid, no Nando's chicken. - He... Yeah, OK. He is... - Nando's Chicken is South African franchise. - What the fuck is he saying? - What we're trying to say is, you're still part of his tour. OK, like, we talked about RPG buying one of your tracks. Your message is still gonna get out there. I heard you were working on that sick new demo, you know? Maybe I could do something with that. Great, yeah. Take some... You want my shoes? - What else you want? - Hey, Zed! It might keep your mum from working those extra shifts. Rar! We don't want to do this without your blessing, Zed. We're all in this together. I filled up your water jug. The phone is here. - Where shall I put your phone? - We're late to prayers. - If you're in a rush, go! - Shh. It's OK. Keep it under your pillow, in case you want to call the nurse. Call us if you need anything. We're going now. Come on! Don't go to sleep too late. Don't listen to the doctors. This sperm freezing is nonsense. Look at him. Be more sensitive. Don't tell me how to talk to my son. "Be more sensitive"! Dad. 'Sometimes I see that man. 'The fat man with flowers on his face. 'Why do I see him? 'What does he want?' 'Son. 'Shut your face. 'It's all nonsense. 'Go to sleep.' 'But Dad, he's trying to say something to me. 'Who is he?' 'Toba Tek Singh. Toba Tek Singh.

OK, so what's there gonna be, huh? Huh? Maybe opening up a fucking... a fucking cassette vinyl store? Do you want to do that? Is that gonna make you happy? Since when have you worried about what I want, Zaheer? You've always done what you want. Yeah, you tried to stop me from moving to America. You tried to stop me from doing music. And was I ever successful? Did you ever listen to me? No, but can't you just let me do my thing, man? Do your bloody thing! I'm trying to help you! - I just want your blessing, man. - Is everything all right? I can't give you my blessing if I don't believe in it, Zaheer. Sorry, I can do anything else, but I cannot lie. What's going on? We can hear you outside. - Everything's under control. - What's this? It's just cupping. No big deal. Cupping? Who did this? I've got to do something I can't just sit on my hands. I'm always stuck cleaning up your mess. Shut up, woman! He's my son. Can you guys stop shouting, for once. Did the doctors give you permission? You know what the infusion will do to him? What's going to happen? Nothing ever changes! Nothing happens! We go around in a circle! I'm just trying to f... Stop shouting. It's hurting him. Zaheer! Zaheer! Nurse!
