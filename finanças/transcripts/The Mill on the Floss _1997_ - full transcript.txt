Sold to the lord of there, number 14. - Lot number 15... - Not this lovely rocking chair for baby... I hope, lord... do not think that'll just hold a grudge because my husband has lost the lawsuit and the bailiffs come to the house and have sold the clothes Why have you come to see me Mrs Tulliver? If you allow me, lord.. Not to defend my husband, by striving so hard in irrigation, And.. for your hobby with lawsuits, And now you've got an attack that has been as good as dead What do you mean by all this? What I mean is that ... I have come to tell you... I can not believe, to behave like a gentleman and don't buy the mill -Who has told you that you had no intention of buying? - Mr Deane. He says that the "Guest and partners" could buy it and let it take you for them But only if you do not pujara and raise the price. But if I buy it and let him manage her husband -Oh, lord, he would never do such a thing, his name is for him like a poison, what do you consider as guilty of their ruin -o Is a jackass stubborn! Please excuse me but I have work to attend to They say that brings bad luck to the mill of Dorlcote change of hands, because the river he will be angry and could stay without water and then... Yes. Yes. Please, don't tell anyone that I have come to speak with you, my son will be angry with me much for rebajarme as well, and I already have enough problems that I regañen my own children.

Elizabeth Dodson. - Twenty-two years since we got married. - The next annunciation. I don't bear a grudge, Bessy. We made a promise in good times and bad But I never would have thought that it was just as bad as this - Breast. - No. Let her talk Well, I just... what I mean is that ... Wakem has it all What will serve you confront him? It says that you can stay here and manage the mill for 30 shillings a week, and a horse to go to the market Serve John Wakem. And we will serve you as an honest man But since I will never raise its head I'm like a fallen tree And never will I forgive them Tom. Now write that down in the Bible. Dad, is it wrong to curse and hold grudges. Writes that Edward Tulliver went to work for John Wakem to make peace with my wife and because I want to die in the house in which I was born and where my father was born and then writes that does not forgive John Wakem and that desire to fall on him all kinds of evils. Write it down. And write you will always remember what John Wakem has made your father and that, is what thou shalt pay to him and his descendants - if you have the chance - Dad, don't do it Shut Up, Maggie. Should I write it Sign it. My father is so changed, Lucy. It is quiet and bitter Speaking of curse and hatred. And my mother regrets for bed linen and the cutlery lost Sometimes I feel so angry. And I hate it, Lucy. And then cry with shame for having given back to the sadness And how is Tom? I know that my father is very pleased with him since he has started to work in "Guest and Co". Tom has little time for my It seems no matter what we think or feel. Do not make more than work And all you need, Lucy .... he your priority, your only purpose While I... Dearest Maggie ... I want great things, beautiful things things in my life, I ... Is it a sin, right? To love myself, find my happiness What is nothing mature, right? I want to be happy I don't see anything wrong with it I want to love and be loved Maybe get married, have my children Joys that god has prepared for us, for sure And not desearamos nothing, if you do not ansiaramos nothing then we wouldn't disappoint It is more than I should have Is my contribution. I have accepted the job of seamstress for the clothing store white I don't like my sister to do that. Do not stoop that way. I will repay the debt. Leave it to the girl if that is their intention There is to pay to the creditors. What I know Dad, do you think we can risk some money? - what to Do to make us win more? - How is that? A small business. I have carefully examined No. In business you need luck And the fortune is certainly against my Goodbye, David. Philip. It is good to see you at home. You've been in Italy too long You want every penny to be justified. Damn it! Mr Wakem. Mr Tulliver. You found Me in my favorite place. Veniamos here when we were kids Called him Graves Red - does it bother You that you have followed up to here? - No. I wanted to talk to you, but not in the house. Not with our parents there What a girl so strange was! What I am now as you'd expect? Much more beautiful Everything has changed What I wanted to tell you... is that I can not meet you It is not fair to sacrifice everything to feelings unreasonable of other people I don't want to do in the life of a parent even more difficult. I would give up many things for my father, but ... not a friendship Or an affection Tom has told me not to talk more with you Will not change his mind. - what about me? - What will become of both If we start to find ourselves at the end we will discover the separation would be more painful. I used to be so frustrated because I could not get what I wanted But now I have renounced, to be desired. If you give up desire, renounce to live. I'm supposed to be... hungry for that which we feel as beautiful and good I love good pictures, I would like to be able to paint it myself There are also other things that desire ...things which other men have - ..and that to me always I be denied - I would not think so. Then, let me see you once in a while I will come as often as you can as this time With the hope of seeing you If encounters are random, right? There will be the impression of doing something wrong. I remember that many years ago that I got preocupabas by my Tom. I never importaré as much as he The first memory of my life it is to be next to the river Floss, while Tom will catch me by the hand. I'm glad that you get out more often. The fresh air gives color to the face. Dear Philip, you must have seen and learned so many things during this time I wasn't sure that you still really cared I knew that you would continue to be the same of when we were kids Things that have more effect on us I don't think you can fully explain Why do some pieces of music affect me in a way more strange than others? Sing for me and I'm not going to look I remember how much you liked the book, Maggie. - I have given up on the books - why? Why do you have to deprive myself as well? You're stunning Cast the view back one day and these simple satisfactions that you denied will seize upon it as if it were a appetite wild Do not deny yourself these things It is such a bright woman that you always were destined to be full of fire, spirit, and imagination. Once to be able to buy my first merchandise and reselling it I will be in a position to refund your initial fee. I use the profits that you make in every little transaction in buying the following goods I want to use the knowledge I have attained working for you, lord. To use it well. We have to pay the debts my pay, and my father will not be sufficient My father is sick of the concern I've wondered ever if you could get to love a man that other women would not like to never That would depend on what the reason why they don't like Well, suppose you were a man... without presumption, that I thought had nothing of which to boast that had been marked from childhood by some kind of suffering and who loves you, for whom you were the light of her life... I have been a fool to say this, please forget it No. I had never thought of you as a lover I want to say... it's like one of those stories that one imagine... No one wants to marry me Do you love Me? I think that it is best not to continue talking, Philip. We can't even be friends if not a secret Our meetings are so lovely All of our conversations and the books But I have troubled you again, I get tired of my house. and it breaks my heart Do not think of the past Think of the future... of our love Any obstacle can be overcome with time We only have to wait We can live in hope You... I promised... Maggie, would you give me a kiss when you come back to see me. Kiss me now - I don't want compassion - I don't think that you can love anyone more of what you want you As brother and sister Oh, Philip. Wakem. How dare you making fun of the name and the respectability of my family? Even with my friends my sister is out of the question. Neither your father nor our consent to the marriage. You must metértelo in the head So, what you think with your secret meetings? Maggie is more beloved to me than for you You are unable to understand what I feel for her. Approach of new to it and your miserable body will not be able to protect you - Idiot without a brain - I'll give You a beating, Wakem, - and you will expose to public ridicule - I despise you for the laugh at your deformity Throughout life you have made reproaches to others, convinced that you had all da reason you're so narrow-minded that you can't see that there are better things that your conduct and your petty ambitions. I know that I am wrong, but it is by feelings that you've never had and you will never need - you Think these full of love and tenderness and how do you prove it? by disobeying and deceiving Oh, the fun you punish me You have No piety, no sense of your own sins. You can only give thanks to God for your virtues. I have a different way of showing my affections. Oh, you are just with your superiors, do you not? With your office skills, Lucy has told me that his father is impressed grateful to be a dad with their achievements That's because you're a man, you have power in this world. If you can't do anything sometete to those who can I will submit when you think it is fair and do not think I shall give up Philip just for me to obey you so Or swear on the Bible that will not see more or I will tell dad You have to choose. Choose! Gentlemen... this meeting has been convened for the benefit of those who still have outstanding credits Mr Edward Tulliver in the mill of Dorlcote. We welcome you all here today It is a fact so sad that... in this world incomprehensible for us to be knaves Do not appoint anyone today but there are you seem to be able to seize the luck of a man ... and break it in pieces But today, I can tell you that I have a son... Tom, he has taken all my luck and stuck the pieces again Cost Me good money their education and I consider it money well spent You have forgotten the important part, friend. I... I just want to say that ... - Has gained 300 pounds - What? Borrowed my brother-in-law, Mr Deane and with a lot of hard work... - has gained 300 pounds - Bravo boy And is to be paid to all I Tulliver! I have come to tell you that I received another complaint about the quality of your flour Now you can find someone else to work the mill for you Have you been drinking, sir, eh? During your little meeting I don't need to drink for me to realize that I don't want to work more for a scoundrel like you So don't! You can leave the mill morning, lord Now, let me pass, damn First, I will listen Oh dad! Enough is enough! "Enough, dad! Oh dad! Oh dad, stop it! I beg you, enough, enough, enough! I played my I hit It was just right I never wanted anything that was the right thing. Do you forgive him? Do you forgive all, now? No, my daughter Do not forgive Thank you, lord We will What will it take to recover One year after Good day - Good morning, Mrs Tulliver. - Good day, Mr Guest. I must admit that takes very good care of the house of the lord Deane. Thank you, lord My love, I have important news, Stephen. My cousin Maggie comes to see us and there is no girl in the world to want more I hope it has more level of conversation that his mother That is horrible on your part, Mr Guest. Poor aunt Bessy. Along the disease of the mother, and after his death, Bessy has been a great consolation for my I have been told that your brother does not support to be in the same room as my good friend Philip Wakem. Do you think Maggie Tulliver the same thing? It has been very sad times after the death of his father and the abandonment of the mill. It is best to call Philip, you have such a sensitive soul Only your delicate touch can to appease his and his worth in an uproar Both my father and your father hold in high esteem to Tom Tulliver. The rising star of the "Guest & Co". Dad says that he is a man of principles It seems more proud than Lucifer Lucy. I don't know what kind of spell you have to look so elegant wearing old clothes I would disappear. Enjoy both with the happiness of others I would like to be like you You've had a life so sad and bleak until now But that will change. I will You'll have new dresses and good music and days delicious do-nothing My cousin Maggie. Maggie, Stephen Guest. I think that Mr Guest you imagined different I wish I always could find with the fact that reality is more beautiful than my preconceived ideas. So ... now say what you had to say Dear Maggie, you've always said that you like the admiration of others Very well, but the formulas are fulfilled artificial does not make me feel anything. Then, I will not direct you any, Mss Tulliver. -Thanks, that will be a show of respect. Let's go to the river I'll take the coat Do you like Maggie, right? Lucy. I would like to paddle You have to teach me Lucy, you have to sit in the stern during the trip I warn you, if you try to do something, or do it well or don't do anything. Tell me that you think of Stephen. Good or bad for you Oh, I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be so quiet and safe. Nonsense. You seem a little cocky, as I realize it. But don't dislike it, right? How would disgustarme anyone who had promised to make you happy, Philip Wakem returns home early from his travels. We'll have fun together, the four of us. - we will Sing and we will play music - Oh, can't I I promised Tom that would not speak to Philip without his consent Tom may not be as tyrant It gives Me a lot of fear to re-mention the subject before him and that we go back to fighting each other. It's wonderful that you want it to Philip. I never thought that happiness could happen. I will find the way I have to make this possible You'll get married with Philip... when I marry Stephen. Aunt Gritty. Maggie. What is Tom at home? I want you to deliver me from the promise about Philip Wakem. I wish to see it. It is not for me, I don't have order, It is for Lucy. Knows you and wants you to go to your house Very well Is that all? Oh, Tom, don't be so hard on me I've kept my promise all this time You are always on the ends Without trial I understand that ... even the idea of marriage can be wrong I've given up thinking of him as a lover Already I see Well, I don't want to press too much the matter. I want to be as good a brother as you let me Is it not true that now you do not think that I am bad? No. Good day Walked by here What Lucy has gone? I would like to tell you that Philip Wakem has come back from overseas? And I brought the music that I asked Do you like sitting alone?

Oh he had a good hand, you know Oh, Philip. We can see each other spend time together Well, I am here. I'll have to find a job soon I can not live depending on others. Not of Lucy or my brother for a lot of who would like to Why find a world away from those who love you? I don't think that I can get too much love happiness I've always lived along with the penalties. We can not escape the sorrows, the pain is part of life, like love Philip, you are my conscience What thing has happened? You have such a great look Philip, yesterday I had a conversation the most interesting thing with my father Ask if your father would not be losing interest in the mill If so, "Guest & Co" might be willing to buy it. And if it did, did you convince your father to reinstate the Tulliver? - We have a high regard for Tom - What is the truth? Would you shalt set before them your father? Would be so happy to Bessy. And Maggie, of course. If Tom's recovery of the mill for your father wants to make peace could be more ... for Maggie and for you It is an unpleasant surprise Well, you're an adult. Marry if that is what you want - I don't have anything. I am an amateur artist... Ah. You need my money I need your blessing.
