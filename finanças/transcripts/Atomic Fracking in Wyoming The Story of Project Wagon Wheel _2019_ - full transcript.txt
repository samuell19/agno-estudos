- No I think we were watching with some interest a program on the western slope of Colorado to which I went down and observed with Dixie Lee Ray who was the first Atomic Energy Commission Chairwoman and quite a remarkable person. She was also the Governor of Washington, a real gal. A real strong person. And we were in an airplane with her and with John Love who I think was the Governor of Colorado at the time. And we flew over that when it detonated to get an idea of what it would do to the surface. And I began to have a world of doubts. Then the doubts grew as Wagon Wheel took shape and it was not going to be one detonation like Rio Blanco was. It was going to be five nuclear weapons, one beneath the other in the same hole each detonated in sequences to do a massive fracturing So that began the study of whether it was worth doing or isn't it. - After World War II, we suddenly had as a nation this atomic energy, which we were trying to grapple with how we had seen very clearly the destructive forces of it. We were now trying to figure out if there was another use for this energy. And the outgrowth of that was the government started a program known as Project Plowshare to try to come up with peaceful uses for this atomic energy. - They were gonna use it to dig harbors and irrigation ditches and all that kind of stuff. And, can you imagine the kind of radiation you would have had with it? - They wanted to dig canals, for example, using nuclear weapons. And the idea was to simply go out and you line these things up and set them off and you don't have to move the Earth, you know? The nuclear weapons move the Earth for you. - Where present land travel is awkward, costly, time consuming, and dangerous. Excavating mountain passes for highways and railroads. Where water navigation is thwarted by imposing barriers of Earth, excavating canals. Where commerce is stifled by forbidding shorelines, excavating harbors. For the diversion of water, cutting channels of great width and depth to carry water to areas of need. This is the peaceful potential of nuclear explosives that the United States is developing for all mankind. In the program it calls Plowshare. - And it was being pushed by the boys of Lawrence Livermore Laboratories where the idea came up. And then El Paso, you know, had all these leases here on the Mesa. - This is what the formation looks like at ground zero under the pressure of some 8,500 feet of battlement Mesa formations above it. The gray sections are mesaverde sandstone and the black portions are shale, which sandwiched the sandstone and thus, entrap the natural gas. The conventional way to release such entrapped gas is to break up the formation by shattering it with nitroglycerin or to open fractures with liquid under pressure. The Atomic Energy Commission believes the nuclear explosive will prove far cheaper and a great deal more efficient. - Nuclear stimulation was designed to recover natural gas from tight rock and sandstone formations. Nuclear stimulation was a commercial use of nuclear explosives and a perfect match for the Atomic Energy Commissions Plowshare Program. - The argument from El Paso and AEC was "Just let us go ahead with this experiment. We can see if it will work and then we'll have the technique if we need it in the future." - On the 10th of December, 1967, in Northern New Mexico with relatively little fanfare El Paso National Gas Company and the Atomic Energy Commission detonated the first warhead designed for nuclear stimulation in what they termed Project Gasbuggy. Consisting of a single 29 kiloton nuclear explosive detonated at a depth of 4,200 feet, Gasbuggy was a declared a success as it apparently did produce some natural gas from the tight formations in New Mexico. The AEC set its sights North to Project Rulison. - This is how the device is expected to stimulate gas production in the Rulison field. The energy released by the nuclear explosion will melt and vaporize nearby rock and will fracture the rock beyond to a diameter of about 740 feet. A spherical cavity of about 160 feet in diameter will be created in about 1/10th of a second or in about the time the shockwave rebounds from the surface. As the cavity cools, the vaporized and melted rock will collect in a puddle at the bottom and most of the radioactivity will be entrapped here as it solidifies. Sometime after the explosion, the roof of the cavity will collapse progressively upward forming a chimney of broken rock to a height of about 370 feet above the point of detonation. Government experts say the factors beyond the cavity area are expected to provide flow channels for some of the gas trapped in the surrounding rock. The chimney will act as a chamber were the gas will collect to be drawn off through a well drilled back into the chimney. - I can't remember what they said about Gasbuggy, but for Rulison they had not used any of the gas that they had produced. - The next nuclear stimulation blast was not conducted until May 17, 1973 in Rio Blanco County, Colorado. - I'm imagining you on that plane now, flying over and looking at the tips on the western slope. Did you have a pretty open mind at that point about it? - Yes, I think so because there were spokesman there from El Paso, one from El Paso Natural Gas, there were a couple from Atomic Energy Commission had done the work getting it put together. Explained what they were using by way of load, I've forgotten now. - Where Gasbuggy and Rulison used a single detonation, Project Rio Blanco would use three 33 kiloton nuclear explosives, detonated simultaneously at various depths in a single wellbore. Colorado's governor John Love originally expressed some hesitation about nuclear stimulation, stating in January of 1973 that he was considering vetoing the Rio Blanco Project. - And there had been a lot of unanticipated effects. Even as a result of those smaller explosions, but AEC, you know, they had X amount of funding for Atoms for Peace. - Project Plowshare? - Project Plowshare. And they were gonna by God use their whole budget whether it made sense or not. - There had been announcements about the Wagon Wheel stimulation project clear back in the late 60s. - El Paso Natural Gas would bring Phil Randolph who was our public relations man, up here to discuss how benign the technology that this was. And to discuss how little it would impact the local people. And, he was kind of a slick, scientifically-oriented gentleman, and the more Phil Randolph talked the more pissed off the people in Pinedale got. It was wonderful. - He didn't have an argument 'cause he went to a meeting in Big Piney. - The cattlemen had a meeting down at Big Piney and there were in excess of a thousand people that attended this because they were gonna discuss this Wagon Wheel Project. - We were pretty upset because the field of course that they really wanted to, the El Paso field that they wanted to try it on, it was the Wagon Wheel, of course. Which is, you know where it is. - Yes, it's-- - Just south of, its on the Big Piney cutoff. - El Paso's Project Wagon Wheel was located 19 miles south of Pinedale. Development on the field had been attempted and failed several times since the 1930s. But Project Wagon Wheel would have been the first to attempt to free the gas using nuclear stimulation. - El Paso Natural Gas was not an outsider in this way. In 1953 or four the Union Pacific Railroad, of which I've had an ambivalence between love and hate all of my life since I was a two or three-year old kid when you're ready to knock them, and that's-- The Union Pacific Railroad ceased the burning of coal in it's prime, which was its the entire system, and put in diesel fuel. Lovely, new, fancy-looking knot rigs. And that put about 3,500 men out of work in Wyoming. And Rushling was a pretty sick town there for about one year and people say "Well, when they're gonna roll up these sidewalks, where do we go from here?" and that sort of talk. And up come the little outfit called El Paso Natural Gas and the first thing you know there's 40, 45 people getting jobs driving trucks and going out south drilling some wells. Another 40 or 50 people employed out northwest and all of a sudden by God we saw something else in south west Wyoming was gonna keep us alive, not just the damned coal. And then, El Paso became a welcomed citizen and stayed that way a long, long time. - If Wagon Wheel was successful and the Sublette County field could be developed, the potential gas was estimated to be a substantial portion of the U.S. supply and worth hundreds of millions of dollars. - Wagon Wheel was gonna be five 100 kiloton devices, something like that, sequentially fired. - As a scientist, I would have been fascinated to see something like this. You know you have all the theories and then you think "Aha, now suppose we had instead of just one detonation going on, we had five sequential, minute apart or something like that, what would happen then?" - While the AEC and El Paso originally proposed Wagon Wheel in 1969, the project wasn't set for several years and local opposition remained mostly dormant. In 1971, a student at the University of Wyoming named Lee Nellis spearheaded the Take a Look Program. - There was a proposal that came out of, I think it was the Adult Education Office, The University of Wyoming, Lee Nellis was the instigator of it. Talking about, the program was Take a Look at your community. The office at the University would help you set up a program so that you could look at the various things that were affecting your community. - In 1971, Sally Makey was a librarian in Pinedale, Wyoming. That fall she contacted Lee Nellis requesting Pinedale as a location of the next Take a Look meeting. - And so we worked out a program with this group and set up the Take a Look Program, and we invited all the government agencies that were in Pinedale at the time. I think the Forest Services, the Bureau, the BLM rather, the Soil Conservation Service, the Game and Fish, and well, we invited the county officials, the town officials. I can't give you all the specifics on the program that we set up, but as we were preparing this program, about that time, there had been announcements about the Wagon Wheel Stimulation Project. - In January of 1972, the Atomic Energy Commission issued it's draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Wagon Wheel and the timing coincided with the Take a Look program scheduled for February in Pinedale. Makey requested copies of the Environmental Statement from Wyoming's U.S. Congressman Teno Roncalio. - When we had this public meeting scheduled we got him to send, oh I think maybe something like two dozen or more so that we could spread them around. - Rarely a night would go by that we didn't have a phone call nine or 10 o'clock at night, sometimes after midnight. Somebody in Wyoming might not be aware of the time difference would call my dad, my mom hated this, but my dad would indulge them and sit there and talk to them for 10 or 20 minutes. Then, the next morning get up and go to his office. - Well, it was pretty hard to keep from being contacted and I was their congressman. You know? Whether it was 25 letters a day or 125, I don't know what it was, but there was a great, great interest in this. - The draft Environmental Statement helped encourage others to take a look and get involved. Among them was a Boulder, Wyoming cattle ranger named Floyd Bousman, who would eventually become one of the chairpeople and de facto spokesman of the Wagon Wheel Information Committee. - But, it disturbed me an awful lot, mainly because of our dam at Boulder Lake that we just finished building and in their Impact Statement they put a value on that dam of $150,000 and it cost in excess of half a million dollars. - And, as I say we tried and tried and tried and we finally got Lawrence Livermore Laboratories finally put out a study and we did not get it in the usual manner. It was sent to us by somebody, who actually, kind of a secret thing, they just shipped us a copy of this and that was where we found out that they had us, our lives were evaluated at about $250-300,000, there were so few of us. - Sally Makey, Doris Burgslander, and Mary Ann Steel were all very outspoken women that were not afraid to give their opinion and that's in such stark contrast to so many women in that time period. And they knew what they were talking about and they were very well-versed at it. - No, I went down and talked Ken Perry into the fact that he ought to be, I went there and I said "Aren't you concerned?" And, he said yes he was and so the two of us got very concerned and then we discovered there were other people in the area that were also concerned and we all kind of just came together. - A young man named John Perry Barlow also became a member of the Wagon Wheel Information Committee. - I didn't actually share the general superstition about nuclear power because I had worked part-time while in college at a nuclear power plant in Connecticut. - Well, you hated that place. - No, I didn't. - You used to have nightmares about that nuclear bomb. - No, no, no, no. - I suppose there were about 40 people from around the community that attended this meeting and voted to investigate further the nuclear gas stimulation proposal. And, that's really where this group evolved. - After that, it was decided that the Wagon Wheel Information Committee would be set up and the whole thing got rolling. - It was an amazing group of people from all kinds of businesses, educators, teachers, businessmen, ranchers, professional people, ministers. It was a real diverse, cohesive group. - We came up with the name the Wagon Wheel Information Committee because although we had a lot of reservations about the project and were quite alarmed, when you really started studying the proposal we wanted to call it a group that was a study group and was trying to, and we were actually trying to study all aspects of it. And, that's how we really got started on it. - I don't know if I've ever seen grassroots, sort of spontaneous grassroots opposition to something get so well-organized and so effective in such a short time. - We constantly worked, we did research, we put things together, you know, we wrote letters, we made phone calls, we spent hours on the telephone, we spoke at public meetings, we made presentations at all sorts of places. The work was ongoing. - We had a real publicity crew. Phyliss Burr was here at the time and she was working for the roundup, part of the time, and then my daughter, Susan Makey, she was getting out press releases. - Although the committee was originally founded to research the project, it would eventually become it's primary opposition. - So as you go to know more about it, what seemed to you to be the biggest problems with it? - Well, the biggest problem to me was the idea that we might be polluting one of the major aquifers of the west with radioactive isotopes that would be around for about 300,000 years. - The water radiation was something that I brought it up in re-reading this that was also left unanswered, and God, that's all we need to do is mess up the headwaters of the Green River that take care of millions and millions of people down stream. - That's right. - Well, it was a scary thing. They let that thing go through out up there at the aquifer. We had a problem forever. - As we studied the Environmental Impact Statement, then we were aware of the possible consequences. - Yes, of course it would be radioactive. - And the idea was that when they piped the gas into gas lines, into pipelines that they would pipe other gas in and the radioactive elements would be diluted. So, hopefully you wouldn't get a dose. - They wanted to flare the gas for a year and it was gonna drop out all the tritium cesium-137 and so forth and so on on the people that lived downwind. - If my recollection is correct, they made statements, for example, to the effect that people living downwind should really not use the milk from their cows. - And of course, when a cow grazes on the grass that has had iodine 131 drifting down on it, the cow concentrates that radioactive isotope in the milk. And then, when the kid drinks the milk ... - And, it becomes an accumulated thing, either the beef or in the milk, it can be transferred to humans. And, since this is a cattle-raising country and the people depend on their livelihood from that, it seemed like an awful risk to take. - No, it wasn't the issue of nuclear power. I think it was the issue of bombs, bursting five of those bombs in one hole that close to each other and trying to tell me on my ranch five miles that I'm not gonna suffer any damage from that goddamned stuff. How can you tell me that? What proof you got that's-- And, they didn't have the proof. That was a tough question to answer for them. - It would hurt a lot of wells, crack a lot of chimneys and basements, if there were such, ruin a lot of bridges, irrigation ditches, possibly dams. And, they did say that it probably would ruin the bridge across the Eastport and the Boulder bridge. That's our only in and out of this place. Mail, all of our supplies. - Not only were those people so arrogant that they hadn't even really figured out what structures were likely to be damaged, you know, that were there to be damaged, they didn't know that waters worth anything. Then they said "Oh well, if you're worried about the dam, we'll drain it." Like an acre foot of water isn't the most precious thing there is around here to a rancher in the summer time. No, we'll just run that water on down the river, you know, then fill it up again when we're done. - I remember someone saying something about, it would just bring up an awful lot of Texans and they destroy the ecosystem of the desert out there because they'd be running back and forth in all their pickup trucks. So, he wasn't concerned about the nuclear thing at all. He was concerned about all these Texans and their pickup trucks. - It just seemed kind of boneheaded. - Well, it was boneheaded, but why they didn't see it, I don't know. - The committee was not alone in their criticism of the draft Environmental Statement. The Wyoming Game and Fish was exceptionally critical of the study, noting several errors and the use of outdated and inadequate information. Game and Fish questioned why the Environmental Statement recommended domestic cattle to be dry fed, but assessed no risk for grass-eating wildlife, such as deer, antelope, and elk local to the area. Despite the Committee's efforts and widespread criticism, the AEC issued its final Environmental Statement on Wagon Wheel two months later in April of 1972. - Another thing that made me mad about it and I thought was dishonest, you'll notice if you compare the two Impact Statements, the draft statement tells about all this tritium and what not that'll fall out on us. We won't be able to drink the milk from our own milk cows, we won't be able to eat our meat and how it goes through the food chain and all this stuff. And then there's no answer or explanation in the final Impact Statement. They just completely ignore that section. Take it out, took it out. - Big natural gas company was not necessarily, that was not automatically considered to be evil incarnate. I mean, for one thing, in those days a lot of people in Sublette County worked for El Paso Natural Gas. - The Governor Stan Hathaway was for it and so was Thyra Thompson who was the Secretary of State. - Well, that's the next question I was going to ask you, what was the statewide response to this? This is not just a Sublette County issue. - Not nearly as vigorously opposed to it as you found in that area. - Their first proposal or press release talked about the wonderful economic development for this area and, of course, there were local residents who were very much in favor. - They thought they were gonna make a pile of money on that. There were several in Big Piney that were for it because they always supported whatever the oil patch wanted to do down there, you know? They had that mentality. - Probably 15, 20 families in the southwestern part of the county here that were for it. And, I kinda know where they was coming from. Oil and gas has been paying for their schools and projects down in that end of the county for years and years. There were, of course, several from Big Piney that were ranchers for the project that flew down there. And, I set right next to Joe Bud, when they blew it off. I got to kidding old Joe and I said, "Well, what do you think about it?" He said "Well, I'm for it." It blew off, lifted old Joe about that high off the ground. You just see the Earth rolling. It was quite an experience. And I says "Well, what do you think of it now, Joe?" He was just white as a sheet. He couldn't say a thing. No comment. - You can't say the county was 100% united, but there were so many more people that took our point of view, especially after we got to presenting what the ins and outs of this. - Even with the publication of the final Environmental Statement, the spring and summer of 1972 would bring some positive news for the Wagon Wheel Information Committee. - Senator Cliff Hansen stated that he had been assured by El Paso's own representative Dr. Phillip Randolph that if the people of Sublette County did not want the Wagon Wheel blast, it would not occur. - This is where I remember coming in. They had Mr. Randolph come and talk to this pretty large gathering of interested people. And made the comment in his little speech, little whatever, and so he made the statement that "You know, if the people of Sublette County don't want this, we're not gonna do it." And that was what I took away from that meeting. That if we could prove to him, or anybody else that the people of Sublette County did not want this, then we had him on his word, he wasn't gonna do it. - We tried to get an official referendum on the ballot. At that time, there was no legal mechanism to do so. - And, we wanted to hold a poll, a straw vote of all the people in the county, how they felt about Wagon Wheel. - In the absence of any legal mechanism to do this, we figured that what we could do is just put up sort of private polling places outside of the public polling places. - And, that was election year and so, we volunteered and took all of the polling places in the county and strictly adhered to all the rules and regulations, stayed back. - They required us to conduct our straw poll at least 50 feet away from the polling place. - But, we stopped everybody that went in and told them what we were doing and do as they chose, either vote or not vote, you know. - I'm sure Sally has this figure, but it was a fairly high percentage of people who voted in the one election who also voted in the other. - And, Sally and I took on Calpet. And, we sat from seven to seven to get 21 voters. That's all the folks at Calpet. - Wow. - The interesting thing is, and I think that Bernie and somebody took Northwest Pipeline and of course, they had a lot more people. But, the interesting thing was that all of our people were either oil company employees, worked for the oil industry in some way, our entire ballot was yeses. They were against it. - We had all the masters, Sublette County, count the votes. - The result was overwhelming. - When the results of the straw poll came back, they showed that 970 people voted against the project and only 279 voted in favor. - And, the straw poll clearly showed that overwhelmingly that people were against the project. - It didn't take long for El Paso to balk on its earlier promise. When questioned at a press conference on November 30, 1972 Dr. Randolph replied, "A small group of people in Sublette County have distributed large amounts of erroneous information and conducted a premature straw poll. We do not feel the poll accurately reflects the feelings of the citizens in Sublette County." - With Dr. Randolph reversing his earlier promise, Floyd Bousman wrote a letter to Senator Hansen. - When we got through talking to Cliff about this, made our case, he agreed that we were entitled to have a hearing in Washington about this thing with El Paso Natural Gas Company, Atomic Energy Commission. Everybody that was involved. - Within a couple weeks, Senator Hansen had arranged a meeting in Washington, D.C. to allow the Information Committee to present their case to the AEC. - We right on, in the beginning, contacted our congressional delegation which was Cliff Hansen, Gale McGee, and Teno Roncalio. And, those three gentlemen did us a very fine job. All three of them, they did a wonderful job for it. - Well, at first the congressional delegation was not very helpful, but I think gradually they started to see that there was a lot of popular sentiment that was starting to gather itself around us. - Especially that we had a great deal of help. I think, Teno Roncalio was especially protective. - Teno was always very easy to reach and to express our concerns to. Our two senators weren't quite that approachable, I guess you might say, but I think because of some of the people on the committee who were so persistent and you know, didn't take no and didn't take no, that we got a lot of attention that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. - Teno Roncalio, he was always sort of a happy guy. He was the guy who really, I think, gave more help, you know, to the people up here. And, I think that Teno's heart was in the right place. - One of things he used to say quite often when I was a kid and I didn't understand it until years later was that there's nothing greater you can do on this Earth than help other people. All the fame and fortune and money, property, prestige doesn't mean a thing if you can't drop what you're doing and help somebody else once and awhile. - I'm trying to hit it every way I could from the appropriations for the money 'cause it's all being funded by AEC. - Right. - Now, because there is no more AEC, as you know, they abolished their commission and they abolished the joint committee also. - We had a lot of help from Teno Roncalio. He was real good, and I did not remember that Hansen did anything, but Floyd said Hansen did get pretty active after he found out that the oil people, themselves, a lot of these oil companies here were not happy about it. And, of course, Hansen's constituency was ranchers. I mean, we're the ones that put Hansen in, you know? The ranch community. And, he also got a lot of votes from Pinedale. - Hansen, I never had that much contact with Hansen. - I mean, he was certainly a gentleman and he certainly spent time with us and he certainly listened. Where it went from there, I don't know. I really don't. - I was kind of afraid of him because he was a Republican and we were Democrats, but the truth is, my dad and Cliff got along pretty well. The changes that Cliff Hansen and my father made to the 1920 Mining, uh, Mineral Tax Act resulted in literally billions of dollars flowing back to the state of Wyoming. - Senator Cliff Hansen was known as an oil man in Wyoming and was much more open to Wagon Wheel initiative. However, he listened to his constituents, sending out a survey even before the Information Committee conducted their straw poll to gauge public opinion. And, it was Hansen who organized the Washington, D.C. trip for the Wagon Wheel Committee. - And, there was no way he could've gone to Washington and made the same case about the community being behind him. Not at all. - The Information Committee hosted a fundraiser they called the Wagon Wheel Blast. - The Wagon Wheel Blast that they had in town, they had a town-wide party. Wide open, swinging party and all the proceeds went to sending the 11 of us to Washington to fight the powers that be. - On December 9, 1972, every bar in Pinedale, all three of them, participated in the Wagon Wheel Blast with live music in each bar and a catered breakfast. Admission was $1 and even though the local temperature in Pinedale was -9 degrees, the event was very successful. - I met ladies in the bar that night that don't drink. You know, little old ladies that had never in their whole lives been in a bar turned out to go to those parties and contribute because they felt that this was a good cause. - At the start of 1973, there had been two nuclear stimulation projects already conducted. Gasbuggy in New Mexico in 1967 and Project Rulison in Colorado in 1969. Project Rio Blanco was scheduled for the late spring of 1973 but Colorado's governor, John Love, had recently stated that he would possibly veto the project. The Information Committee spent the beginning of 1973 getting ready for their trip to Washington. - It was a well-rounded group. We had young people the age of John Perry Barlow, Chrisman's and Swift's went. - I did know the Swift's. I do remember Sally very well. She and Phelps cared deeply about this Wagon Wheel Information Committee. The ranch they had was out in Boulder. And, they went to Washington with the Chrisman's and they paid their own way to go. - The two couples, and then it was Phyllis Birr who worked for the Roundup here, for quite a while. And, she knew her way around television and stuff and she's the one who got Floyd on television back in Washington. - I don't really know why Phyllis came to this country, but she was a real asset and she was involved in everything. And, she had a personality that wouldn't stop. - There was Sally, and Bernie Gosar. - I wouldn't have been able to go on my own dime. I have a lot of little children at home, and so it would have taken quite a bit. But, I do believe Sally Swift bought the ticket for me. And so, I went then. - Daphne and Floyd and Ken Perry and Phyllis and I went in Ken's plane. And then, Mary Ann Steele. And, we took, A.B. Cooper went with us. He was a council person and he went with us. - But, the 11 of us that went on the money that was raised through the contributions felt an obligation to do the best job we could at presenting the case. - To prepare, the committee created a 66 page document titled Statement of Opposition to Project Wagon Wheel. - We wanted to take as a professional looking document as we could and we did it all on a copy machine, but we had various people writing up different aspects. - People who helped on the committee, not the 11 of us, but little old housewives, little old ladies, they came in in a line that formed out on our lawn. - Different people ran them off for us, you know, gave us the paper to put them together. - I think we figured we'd have to have 100 copies of it and that was a heck of a lot of xerox. - We put them together on Sally's big table. - We did our collating. We had piles that went all the way around the dining room table, kitchen table, back into the bedroom, and back around. - And, they marched through and they each picked up one page and when they got done they had one booklet and they lay that one booklet down and one lady was sittin' there puttin' the covers on them and then she'd put it on the pile And, that went on I think for two days. - Then we thought, well the finishing touch will be those brass fasteners and we put those on. And, we took a suitcase, well two suitcases, full of those back to Washington. - Statement of Opposition contained the results of the straw poll, as well as the committees objections to the project, along with source materials and letters from scientists and government agencies that agreed with the committee and opposed the project. The Washington, D.C. agenda began on Monday, February fifth, with a luncheon hosted by congressman Teno Roncalio, and attended by the two Wyoming senators, Cliff Hansen and Gale McGee. The luncheon was followed by a meeting with representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency. Then a meeting with the Department of the Interior and a joint committee on atomic energy. On Tuesday, Phyllis Birr arranged for Floyd Bousman, the chairman of the Wagon Wheel Information Committee, to debate Phillip Randolph of El Paso Natural Gas. - Phyllis Birr made some telephone calls and she set up this Today thing for me to debate it with Phil Randolph, who is gonna be in charge of this Wagon Wheel shot. - Phil Randolph was, you know, was the main mouthpiece for El Paso, And he was, I gotta say, like a parody of your mealy-mouthed corporate tool. - It was pretty short. But, I think I'd come across more as tellin' the truth than Phil did. And, I did, I quoted out of the goddang impact statement a lot, you know. - Floyd came out looking like Henry Fonda and Mr. Randolph came out looking like a used car salesman, and that did us a lot of good. I mean, million people saw Floyd, you know, come off really good. - After the Today Show, the group met with the Bureau of Land Management and then with an official from the president's council on environmental quality. Later, on Tuesday, the committee met with Earl Butz, the Secretary of Agriculture. - The Secretary of Agriculture was also supposedly an expert on energy. And, really a meeting with him lasted about 45 minutes. I really enjoyed visiting with him. - We met with him and he was real, real smart. - We handed him one of these brochures and it was quite thick, was about a half-inch thick, and it looked quite nice. It was typed. They were run off on a xerox machine, but they had been ... - The Statement of Opposition? - It was, yeah, Statement of Opposition. And, it had this real good looking cover and wow, he says, And how much federal money went into the publication of this? - I suppose, how many government dollars did you get, like in a grant or something, to put this together? And, boy I tell you, we fairly well flew at him! - And, we rose up as 11 of us together and we said, Not one single penny! And, we said, let us tell you that there is no ... This is how we made this booklet. And, everything in there is hand done, and Earl Butz at the end of it, he was kind of bemused by a whole business. - Our original reason for going out there was to meet with the head of the AEC, who was James Schlesinger. - Well, interestingly enough, he was replaced about three days before we got to Washington, and Dixy Lee Ray, who became governor in Washington state was the head of it, and she refused to meet with us. She hadn't promised us nothin'. - Despite this last minute schedule change, the final meeting was productive. - This was in Washington in a Senate hearing room. We'd asked Cliff Hansen to chair the meeting and we started off by makin' El Paso Natural Gas come in real mad. - Well, Cliff Hansen was the oilman's senator and we kinda worried about that. You know, we thought, how really sincere is Cliff gonna be? Well, Cliff did us a lot of good. He knew the ins and the outs. And, he served his constituents. - Cliff Hansen, when we asked him to chair the meeting, we asked him if he would ask El Paso to dispense with a big, long lecture about an energy crisis, because we were well aware that there's an energy crisis. So, there's no argument or difference of opinion there. - He rose up that last day that we were there in Washington and the president of the El Paso Natural Gas company he had a great, big, long speech all prepared. - He wanted to use up all the time that was allotted, lecturing us about an energy crisis. - Through with their prepared presentation? - Yeah. - Cliff got up and he said, Before my people even say their pieces, I want you to know one thing, gentlemen, we're not contesting the fact that there's an energy crunch. These people aren't contesting that there's an energy crunch. His speech that he was clutching in his hand was totally invalid. I mean, he couldn't get up after Cliff Hansen said that 'cause we weren't arguing that there was an energy crunch, we were just questioning one technology and there was alternate one that worked better, why didn't they use that? - There was one time when Floyd kind of took over and the president of El Paso got up to say something and Floyd said, Sit down, I'm not finished! We didn't follow all of the proper protocol. - At any rate, we had our string of witnesses. Ken Perry made a real good presentation, and I think Doris and Sally and Mary Ann Steele, we all had a part in it. John Perry Barlow, too. - Talk about the effective and somewhat cynical use of theater. We knew that the best thing we could do was portray ourselves as a bunch of hapless hicks. - We got to talking about this Price-Anderson Act and just a week before, somebody had sent us a clipping out of a newspaper from down at Rifle, Colorado where some guy that had a motel down there was damaged by that experiment. They settled it out of court. Well, I was questioning the general counsel for the Atomic Energy Commission, and he made the statement that there had been no claims of any kind and I wiped that copy of that out of my pocket and read it and he stuttered and stammered about that for a long time. - Overall, the delegation represented the Committee well in Washington and came home feeling good about the trip. - We couldn't have done that without all that months and months and months and months of preparation here. We couldn't have done that. We couldn't have made the presentation we did had we not done all this terrific amount of work ahead of time. There we were, looking them right in the eye. President of the El Paso National Gas Company, those men have high positions, they're executives. They didn't speak any better than some of us. - We had some real good meetings back there and I have felt good about really ever since. I mean, the way everybody conducted theirself and the things we had to say we could back up. - In the Washington meeting, we met with technical people from AEC. The technical people were there from El Paso. We presented our case. I don't think that they were that impressed. I just don't. I think that whole thing hinged on Rio Blanco. - After everybody left the meeting, there were these notepads that were on the table and I thought, Ah, souvenir for the kids. So, I picked them up. And, they were just left there and I figured it was okay to do that. And, one of them had some writing in it. And, I should remember the quote 'cause I said it often enough, and this was Gale McGee's group of people. And, the comment was that, in so many words, these are people who think they can make a difference, ta ta ta dah. And, I just, I wish we could've had another meeting after that 'cause I would've made that one score, too. - We went back to Washington and I think that we were regarded, you know, particularly by Senator McGee's office, as a royal pain in the ass. - It wasn't important for McGee that we were there to try to do something we thought we were gonna do something and we were exercising what our democracy tells us. Citizens' participation, and they just looked down on it. So, that's the worse memory I had. - Do you remember the visits of this Pinedale committee? - I have to be honest with you and it's been too many years. - Sure. - You know, there was stuff going on there all the time. - Of course. - One thing or another. - Governor Love of Colorado also visited D.C. in February to meet with President Nixon. Shortly after returning to Colorado, Love announced that he would not veto Project Rio Blanco and a detonation occurred on May 17, 1973. Two months after the Rio Blanco detonation, Love stepped down as Colorado's governor to accept a position as Energy Czar in Nixon's administration. - When they did the shot, the governor caviled them. You know, he would be the news as veto power. So, they did the one down there at, I forget whether it was Rulison or Rio Blanco. Floyd would tell you which one. - The Rio Blanco was shot. A test down in Colorado, western Colorado at Pullerton. So, they invited people from Pinedale to go, but nobody on the Wagon Wheel Committee were allowed. They didn't want us. But, we had become real well-acquainted with the boys at Lawrence Laboratory in California, Lawrence, Livermore, and they invited us. - When you saw, by God, we'd just take it up and take them up on it. Ken Perry had a big old twin-engine plane, and they flew us all down, most of the Committee down with the exception of Floyd. Floyd drove down, and why, I don't know, but it worked out great because with Eddie's car, go down and take pictures after the explosion. - They had a tour bus that they took all these people that weren't, and they had these guys giving the spiel. Oh, I guess it was reporters. - We actually couldn't see the plane. And, we was up there. We was to get the effects of it all. And, we'd been toured of where it was at, a little crick run up around Watt, the old schoolhouse and things like that. And, there was gonna be no damage and we was to witness before and then leave us to witness after. Well, while we was sitting there, about 300 of us on our rear ends and you could see this thing coming. It was almost instantaneous. I'd say it lifted me off the ground that much. - Right after the shot, soon as it went off, why there was a waiting period while they cleared the road. As soon as they were cleared, why we took off. - Floyd and I was the only two kind of jumped the gun. We weren't supposed to took pictures. - About a mile away from the shot, there was an old, historic rock schoolhouse. Well, when we got there, there was an engineering company from Grand Junction that's springing out, out of the building all the bracing, planks, timbers. They had that thing braced on the inside like you wouldn't believe. We watched them take it out and put it on their truck and drove off. - Well, they had beams all the way around it and then cabled the beams into it to keep it from shaking or moving, and I was surprised it still didn't cave in, but it didn't. - About 30 minutes later, here comes the El Paso bus with some ideal people. - When the tour bus got there, Floyd and those guys were standing there and they watched the bus disgorge all these people and they hear the tour, Now see, nothing happened to this nice, old historical building and Floyd said, No and they never mentioned the fact that they had wrapped it three times around with all these cables and padding and propped it up with boards and done all this stuff to keep it from getting cracked. And, they had taken all that down before the tour bus got there, see? - They said, See, it didn't hurt the schoolhouse at all. Do you see what I mean? - Yes. - Well, I think that's deceptive. - We caught them in the act. - The first disappointments came, I think, when it became obvious that the chimney, they called it, that is created by the detonation, doesn't remain open. It's so hot that it melts almost everything, any form of limestone or other structure that's in the Earth, the crust. And thereby, it defeats the purpose for which it is intended. That is to keep the fissures open so the natural gas can come in off these little stratigraphic traps and be recovered and put to good use, that's the beginning of the big disappointment of this thing. - It was a very gradual evolution over to the point where they had enough people who were willing to think that we could stop it. - Well, I think most people thought you couldn't stop it, but they were sure for you doing it. - The first hope that Project Wagon Wheel might be canceled came in April of 1973 when the newly-appointed head of the AEC, Dixy Lee Ray, declared the project was dead as a doornail. However, in 1974, Wagon Wheel was still on the AEC agenda. In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission was still pursuing field-wide development using nuclear stimulation. The AEC also continued to conduct tests to develop a sequential firing method. - You know, they'll say things to you and make you feel good while you're there and then you look and say, Ah! That's what they really thought? - The overwhelming local attitude was Well, it sucks, but there's nothing we can do about it. There's nobody liked it very much, but that it was inevitable. - Dixy Lee Ray and the AEC requested 107.6 million dollars for up to 30 nuclear stimulation projects in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. - Yet, the government really is going to go ahead with something like that. They will give you sugar-coated pill and tell you they're gonna help you out in every way they can, but basically they simply do it. What it is is just a form of condemnation. - Dixy Lee Ray attempted to harmonize her statement. And, the AEC plans for further development, stating that Wagon Wheel was dead as a doornail for 1975, but that the AEC still believed nuclear stimulation had the potential to add significant natural gas reserves to the current U.S. supply. Shortly after Dixy Lee Ray's reversal, Roncalio attempted to defund the AEC's entire Plowshare Program, but this was defeated on the House floor. The following month, Senator McGee backed by Senator Hansen passed an amendment through a senate subcommittee that would ban the Atomic Energy Commission from detonating any future atomic blasts underground for the purpose of stimulating natural gas. - I wish I could tell you what this is and when the decision was made and by whom to do away with it and to abolish it, to abandon it. - It's one of those things where the more you know, the more you realize you don't know. And, I don't think there is a definitive answer as to why Wagon Wheel didn't happen. - I kind of feel it all just sort of peaked and then, people started becoming more involved with their own interest. - So, after that, things just kind of, I forget, they just finally gave up on the damn thing. - The Plowshare Program was never officially canceled. However, the program received no further funds for fiscal year 1976. And, the AEC quietly shelled Project Wagon Wheel. - If we'd been the first project, it would've been a lot different. - Then, the fact that, I think, it would've taken place, I think if Rio Blanco had been a success, they certainly would've had a shot up here. - They would've irradiated us, if we hadn't done anything. I mean, we fought and fought and-- - They were getting oil-drilled and everything? - Yeah. We delayed and delayed and delayed. We caused them to be right, until the facts came in from Rulison and Rio Blanco: the technique does not work. - That's like showing that a small community could get together and fight the federal government or any other agencies that was doing harm to our community, and I think we done one hell of a job. - Well, I think it's one of the most remarkable things I ever heard of. I knew it was going. I figured they didn't have a chance of a snowball in hell. - I think that it showed that the people can make themselves heard. - Actually, we're one of the few grassroots groups that ever prevailed. - The Atomic Energy Commission itself was abolished in October of 1974, or more correctly, absorbed into a newly-created energy research and development agency which eventually became part of the United States Department of Energy. - The coloring indicates that we will strike the appropriate balance between energy and environment, and we will keep the sky blue and the grass green. - That's a good one. - They learned how to do the kind of environmental studies that can't be torn up by a bunch of local characters. - One of the biggest things that happened though was that people became aware of the possibility that environmental issues were something that you could care about, even if you were a local. - Unsure if Wagon Wheel was permanently canceled or waiting for a similar project that might require their efforts, the Wagon Wheel Information Committee continued to meet annually to keep its incorporation until 2006.
