Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. "SEAGULL" Geoff? Geoff, I've got one of my migraines coming on. Geoff? Oh. I've got an awful head coming on. Have you taken anything? I've taken the new pills but they don't work. They don't even touch the sides. Should I take you to the clinic? I went last week. Can you go? Yeah. Okay, I'll go. Thanks, Geoff, thanks, and can you get a couple of bottles of the Pino as well when you're there? I'll just finishing here, love, then I'll go. Hello granddad. Hello, puppet. Oh, this is lovely. Is that you and me? That must be Violet, right? And who's that? Let me guess, Nana? It's beautiful. Come then, give me a chance. I'll start back here. And ready, steady, go. Got you, got you, got you… Spaghetti again I'm guessing? Yeah. Always spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti. Or noodles.. Or noodles. Alright, let's get you home. What is it, granddad? Just get in the car, please. Is that a phoo? In the car. Do you think it was a person phoo? What? On top of the car? Was it a person Phoo? No I don't think so. Well, it looked too big to be a dog phoo. How did it get up there? I don't think the dog got on top of the car. Well, it didn't really look like the type of phoo you could pick up. What does pe-tri-fied mean? Did you ask Nana to help you? She says she's busy. It's a bit loud, isn't it? I can't hear anything. Well, have you asked her to turn it down? Can you do it? They're just about to do the reveal. You know she won't listen to me. Look, I was hoping you would read with Lily. Okay, yeah... Yeah, I'll be down in a minute. Dinner will be ready by then. Oh, lovely, what are we having? I'm starving. On our car, phoo on our car? Don't write that, Lily: "Phoo on our car." That was what happened. Granddad said it was a dog phoo but I thought that it was much too big. What? Someone shat on our car? Granddad had to scoop it off the roof up and clean it all up. Is that why you took so long? It's probably the immigrant. What immigrants? From the estates, you know? What estates? We're not living near any estate. Oh, come on Geoff. They're in the news. They're everywhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, over here taking our jobs. Something you don't have to worry about. And I doubt they want mine. I thought you were doing a wash today? If I did, it wouldn't be in there. Those are the dirty clothes. Do you want to tell me where can find it? Downstairs, where I normally hang the washing. Um, can I have a bit of your saussage? Guess what we found on the roof of the car today? Tell me. A real human phoo. You're shitting me. Did someone shit on your car Geoff? It was the immigrants. Off the estates. It wasn't the immigrants. Really? Who would have done something like that, Geoff? I didn't catch them. Why are you looking at me like that? Right, I'm off. Oy, cheeky Bugger. Can we play one more time Granddad, please? No, we can't. It's way past your bedtime young lady. But I'm nearly 8. Yes, and when you are, you can stay up half an hour later. Come on, nearly a birthday. Hey, are you absolutely sure you don't want to invite anybody over from your class? Nanna doesn't like other children in the house. True, but this is a special occasion. I'll tell you what. We'll have a chat with her about it tomorrow. Let's hear what she has to say about it, all right? Right, come on, I'll tug you in. I love you Poppet. Thank you. Find me an easy on. Ah, okay. I hope you got it fixed. What?...Whatever you were doing at 4am. Sorry, did I wake? And the rest of the bloody neighbourhood. Well, it's all fixed now. What's that? Well, there are these things called trees, some of them bear fruit. And they pick the fruit and squeeze it and the liquid that comes out is called juice. I know what it is? Ok, time to go. Come on Poppet. Come on. By, Lily darling, have a lovely day. By. Violet? Violet,... is that you? Geoff?... Geoff? Geoff?... Geoff? Christ, what happened?... What the hell were you trying to do? Why was the kitchen door open? Calm yourself...calm yourself down and tell me what happened. Would you get off the car please? Aw...fuck... Hey... Are you right mate?.. Yeah. Do you want me to call the police?.. I'm fine, no... ...fine... You want to get that checked out? Yeah, it's just sprained, thank you, thanks for stopping. Granddad, why is your hand in bandage? There you are? How was school?... Good. Great. Come, let's get you home then. But why is your hand in bandage? I cought it in a car door? Aw... does it hurt?.. Oh, year, come on. Come on, into bed, please, poppet. I'm not tired yet. You were yawning all the way through dinner, come on? Well, what about a story? Not tonight puppet... ...you can reach yourself for a while if you want, come on, legs in. There's a good girl. Night, night. Is this going to take long? Would you mind sitting down, please? How'd you get hold of this? Why are you asking me? Because your mother was attacked this morning? I could have been killed. What're you talking about? Was it one of your friends who popped round to give us a bit of a fright? I have no idea what you're talking about. Maybe you don't like the fact that we're throwing you out. Since when are you throw me out...mum? Look Violet, we both know you don't like me. Never have, never will,... ...but somebody has to look after your mother. I don't think you'll ever be ready for that. Now,... what I can't accept is when you put your mother's life in danger. Do you actually think I would do such a thing? Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... for you to take some responsibility? You might get some satisfaction out of paying your own bills, washing your own clothes doing your own shopping, doing your cooking... You're actually enjoy this, don't you? Oh,... have your keys turned up yet? You're just going to sit there and let him manipulate you? Keep your voice down. Stop interfering. I'm only doing what needs to be done. I don't need you. Really?...Why don't you come along tonight? What does that mean? It does it mean anything? It's just pointless vandalism. What does vandalism mean? Who the hell is doing this?... The immigrants? Will you stop blaming the immigrants for heaven's sake? I'm sorry, Poppet. It's not your fault. Come on. I'll sort this out later. Have you thought about using a ladder? Can I have the keys to the new lock? I'm going to be home late. I'm not sure we can trust you. All right, I'll wake up when I get home, then. What makes you think you don't wake us up when you have a key? What are you doing?... Where are you going? There's no one outside. We're almost done. Do you want a cup of tea? Right, I've got to go now. I left her in the bath but she's calmed down a bit... Thanks, Violet. Wait...wait a second. Sorry about earlier. We just need to be careful. I don't need it. If you don't do this, I will. It's show time. Lily...we'll take the car today Poppet, alright. Come on. Granddad...who's that? Get in the car, please, Poppet. You stay there. Wow, it really is you? Listen, I'm a bit busy right now, but why don't you and I sit down and have a nice little chat? Good to sort things out, right...yeah? Over there I have a little girl who is very frightened. It's my job to look after her. If you ever, ever come near her... You stink. Get yourself cleaned up. For years I've listened to you whining: "Make him pay", you said, "make him suffer". You're a coward. Go away. There's no spine to you. Why don't you leave the girl to fend for herself, eh? She's not even eight and she's got more guts than you... which is just as well because she's going to need them... Aw! I don't need you. Where're you going... bitch? I'll find you. Lily...Lily! I love you pop it. You know that, eh?... You know that? If you ever get frightened of anything, you'd tell me, right? There's nothing I wouldn't do for you, Poppet, you know that, don't you? I will always look after you. We look after each other, yeah. Go on. Can I help you? If you're not going to buy anything, then you can move on... SQUAWK... Connor, come in here a second? What? Rose? Where the hell have you been? Who's doing this to us, Geoff? I think its Rose, Geoff? Geoff... What if it is Rose? What if it is Rose, Geoff? I think it's Rose. I think it is Rose. We need to go to the shops today, Geoff... It wouldn't hurt you to get out of the chair once in a while and go yourself. Hello, Poppet. Granddad? Aren’t you going to ask me what we learned at school today?.. Er-ha. We learned about seagulls. Did you know that when a Seagull has babies they keep them in the nest until they can fly... but sometimes the seagulls falls out of the nest before they can't fly.. so they can't get back into the nest again. But the mummy still looks after them... Who's that, Granddad? What the hell do you think you're doing standing out here in the rain? She's fucking fine, I've told you, I'll look after her. It's got fuck all to do with you anymore. Suppose you want a chinwag now? A bit more of fucking daddy, don't you? Fucking come on, come on. Stop. Rose? Come back here...now. Fuck! I'm not gonna to hurt you. Do you know who I am? You've seen me before, in the fish shop in the harbor. It's my dad who own it. There's someone who wants to meet you. Eh, police! It's my little girl, she's been taken. She's only seven years old, nearly eight...Lily No. Relationship? I look after her...I... I'm really sorry about this. I didn't mean to scare you. Do you recognize the girl? We used to go out before you were born. We had a good laugh together. Back then, I learned she wasn't someone to mess about with. Never get on the wrong side of Violet. Is she still a bit like that? She can get very cross if things don't go her way. She's all right, though. I bet she likes you, though. Do you like chocolate? Your sure? You like drawing? I hope you're not waiting for me. You didn't think I'd miss out on this part, did you? Nice work girl. I loved the business with the car. How did you persuade fish boy to help you? Do you fuck him? So, what's the plan? Looks promising. Wait...you'll scarer her. Hurry up. Come back. You can't do this without me. Come back here... You can't do this without me...bitch. You can't get rid of me that easily. I did this one about four weeks ago. It's still in the park. I can show it to you if you like...yeah. I'm going to leave you with Rose for a bit. It's okay, she just wants to meet. I'll be right outside. If you need me, you just shout. As soon as you're ready, I'll take you back home, all right? Do you live here? That's my drawing. Love hearts, because we love each other. I look after granddad and he looks off to me. We both look out for each other. Could I have it back now, please? It's my drawing. Could I have it back now, please, I left it in my diary. I'd like to go home now, please. Arw, Connor...Connor...Connor. You're a disgrace. How could you do this to me? How could you do this to me? You're just a slut, that's what you are. Will you two stop it...Janet! Lily?.. Where have you been? Is she here?.. Have you been to the shops?.. No. She's in the bath. What did they do to you? We just talked. Talked...where did they take you? Up on the cliff, somewhere. You might be starving?.. No, because Connor gave us dinner. He gave us fish and chips. Corner...yeah, of cause. Come on, let's get you dried off. Get you into bed. I need to speak to her, Geoff. No, she's completely insane. There's no point. I'm going to see Connor tomorrow. No, you're not. Nobody leaves this house. It's too dangerous. I'm not staying here. You'll do as you're told. We've got Lily upstairs... Nobody leaves and nobody comes in.. For how long?.. Till I say so. And what about the police? Called them, there's nothing they can do. She's family right? Why, Geoff...why does she hate us so much? Stop fussing, it won't get you anywhere. We're going back tomorrow. He'll be expecting us. What did you do? You're just a slut. Let her go...what are you doing? Slut... You too, break it off...Janet. Mum? You want to keep the noise down, please. It's two o'clock in the morning. What the fuck are you playing at? Alright... Are you alright? Yeah... Calm down, will you? It's got nothing to do my dad. Just...give us a moment...please. So?.. So? What are you playing at? She came by the shop yesterday. I hadn't seen in eight years. I thought she was dead. And you thought it would be a good idea to help her a kidnap a child? Have you seen the state of her? She needs help. Whoa...she just wanted to see you. Why didn't you wake me? No school today Poppet. Why don't you sit down and get your laptop out. I'll get you breakfast in a minute. Why am I not going to school? Breakfast Poppet, come on, put that down. Where have you been? I told you not to leave the house? Are you going to let me in? Are you going to answer my question? I went to see Connor. Connor? I told you not to speak to him. What did he say? Come on, Poppet, I'll take you to school. Lily stays with me. Have you been drinking again? I forbid it. Get...out...of my way. I didn't mean to. It wasn't my fault. Shh...it's ok, it was an accident. Violet says they're going to send me away and lock me up. That sister of yours says a lot of things. You're having a baby. Nobody's going to hurt you. I won't let that happen. You promise? I promise. Take that, you fucking bitch. Okay, Connor. I'll take it from here. Are you ok, Rose? She'll be fine. Has Connor been here long? A bit. What do you tell him? Nothing. What have you told him? I'm making a tea. Do you want one? You can do this on your own, alright...alright? That's my girl. No need to be afraid. Geoff...I know it's been hard for you. It's been hard for me, too. We just need to talk...Geoff...Geoff. Geoff, if you leaves you'll never see Lily again. You'll never see your granddaughter, ever again. Mum?... What?... Yeah, I know he's been drinking. No, I don't want to speak to him... What?... I'm on my way, just keep him there as long as you can. Connor, call me back, it's urgent. What the hell do you think you're doing? Geoff, calm down? Get out of my way. Just calm down, Geoff. Calm down, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I shouted at you. I'm sorry, and you were right about Rose. You were right. She never accepted you. You stupid woman. She never accepted you and I didn't deal with it, Geoff. That's my fault, Geoff. It's my fault, but don't let her come between us again, Geoff. Don't let her do this to us. Hello?.. I'm here to pick up Lily. Yes?.. I'm granddad, it's an emergency. Well, I think there's been a mix-up, she's just been picked up by her aunt. Hello, is everything all right? Oh, this is all your fault. What the hell is going on? This bitch has been screwing my boyfriend. No... Rose? ... No, I didn't... Liar. You come down Violet. I hate you. Do you think Connor is interested in you? He doesn't want you. No one wants you. We all wish you were dead...ARGH. Can I say that I'm sorry...for what happened? Of cause. Rose came...She left this for you. Why did you come back? You...used...to love...me. I want to show you something. Where are we going?.. Come on. Have you ever thought of what it might be like to have wings? Try it...come on...trust me. Can we go back now? Back to what? You lied to me. This is not going to work. I didn't do anything. Let me go. There's nothing to be afraid of. Please, I didn't do anything. Just let me go, please...please...let me go... Please... I need your help. I'll go. No. I'll get it. Here she is, the birthday girl. Did you have a lovely time? It was great fun. Connor taught me how to do bunny hopping. It was the best president ever. Oh, good. Are these for me? Yeah, yeah...we're going…going open them once we've had the cake. Hello, Poppet. It’s a lovely scooter, Connor, thank you. It's alright. Should we all sit down and get this party started, eh? Yeah, come on. Do you want a jam sandwich, Lily? Juice? .. Yeah. Who's that? I'll get it. Lily, you remember Rose? Your hair looks pretty today. Is that for me? What is it? Some sort of treasure map? Yeah, looks like the harbor. Are we going on a treasure hunt? Can we go, please, please, please, now? The tides are coming in soon, we'll have to be quick. Can we...please? All right, all right, all right, but don't be too long. We'll have the cake when you come back. Yeah, we won't be too long. I think I know where it is... Okay. Do you want to go on the scooter? Yeah... Don't be long, will you? Make sure you keep some for us. Have fun, love you, Lily. Aw, look at that. Did you make yourself? Look at that Geoff, don't they look lovely? Does anyone want a cup of tea? Yes, please. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
