( slow music plays ) ( blades zinging ) ( slow music plays ) The martial arts, the balance of mind and body, the art of motion, strength, discipline. How old do you think the martial arts are? 40, 50, 100 years old? How about as far back as the year 200 BC? And the martial arts were not only practiced by Chinese and Japanese cultures, but even by the Romans. It was in the year 400 BC that a fight was described as being won by one blow, a blow from a man who used a spear-like hand to penetrate the side of his opponent. That style of fighting may have very well been the beginning of what we now call karate, just one of many styles of martial arts. It was in the late 1920s, a mere 20 years or so after the birth of the cinema, that the martial arts found their way up onto the silver screen in a film entitled "The Burning of the Red Lotus." In the years to follow, literally millions of feet of celluloid have been devoted to the martial arts, films as diverse as a samurai roving the wastelands of an ancient China, or the sweeping canvas of a period film replete with elaborate costumes and ornate sets. Now at first, traditional styles of fighting were pretty much what you saw onscreen, but in time, a wonderful permutation that included elements of ballet and incredible acrobatic stunts, complete with intricate and precisely timed movements. It wasn't long before the martial arts movie was off and running with its exaggerated sound effects, its larger-than-life heroes, the martial arts movie has become an intoxicating mixture of excitement and action. Action-- perhaps the most important element in all these films, those blazing fists of fury, those spinning, chopping dynamos that at times seem to define gravity. Whether it's the swift sword of a samurai or the cunning stalk of ninja, the martial art movie has plenty of action. So sit back and let us take you on a ride, a ride with the "Amazing Masters of the Martial Arts." ( snarling ) ( screams ) ( music plays ) ( screaming, grunting ) ( music plays ) ( yells ) ( grunts ) ( music plays ) ( music ends ) ( wind howling ) ( creaking ) ( dog barking ) Howard: The one element of the martial arts film that separates it from almost all others is the importance of one's fighting ability. The fascination is almost primordial. The warrior, sometimes a man with no past, a man with no name, finds himself in a situation whereby he must fight against great odds having only to rely on his own spiritual and physical abilities to survive and endure the obstacles that lie ahead. In this film, Sonny Chiba is one such man, one such karate warrior. Are you a tramp? Why don't you and I be friends, huh? Hmm? No. Aw, now, kid. Come on, kid. Get the kid! ( man screams ) ( glass shatters ) Howard: With his rough and tough street-brawling style of fighting, Sonny Chiba is certainly the essence of the karate warrior. ( skidding ) Hey! Watch out! Where'd you learn to drive? Howard: The samurai, a sword-toting fighter steeped in Japanese tradition, perhaps the quintessential warrior. In the movies, the samurai is depicted in many ways, but the classic style, the supreme confidence to survive against the great odds that invariably test his fighting ability, are always there. Here! The samurai is coming! Howard: The samurai, much like the gunfighters of the Old West, roamed the land, their honor intact, their razor-like swords ever-ready. Man: Don't come any closer. ( sword swooshing ) ( groans ) Stay right there. I'll chop if you don't. ( screams ) ( shouts ) - ( wood clatters ) - ( screams ) Howard: Not all martial artists are soldiers of fortune. Some seek out injustice for noble or spiritual reasons, and some for what is a common theme of the martial arts movie-- revenge. And what do you want? You killed my father at Yi Wu village over 20 years ago. What? You bastards are all bloody murderers. ( sword swooshing ) ( swords swooshing ) ( blades clanking ) Howard: In the film "The Dragon Princess," Sue Shiomi, one of the leading women in the martial arts movies, is thrown into the battlefield of the martial arts after her father is brutally beaten by a group of rival warriors. I swear... I'll avenge you. I promise. On my life. Howard: After her father's death, she becomes the sole heir to restore his honor. In this scene, she uses cunning resourcefulness as she confronts one of her father's murderers, a blind but vicious warrior. ( bells jingling ) ( wind whistling ) ( jingling intensifies ) ( screams ) ( jingling continues ) ( jingling stops ) ( screams ) ( nunchakus whooshing ) ( both shout ) ( groaning ) ( music plays ) Howard: To develop the extraordinary control of mind and body, the martial artist must commit to years of conditioning and training. Starting with the basic eye-hand coordination, the martial artist learns to center and focus his energy so that it can be used for movement. ( music continues ) ( music ends ) Howard: The physical traits of a kung fu master are different from those of a samurai or a ninja. Each develop strengths from a different part of the body, and each utilize different breathing methods and movement exercises known as katas. ( teacher grunting ) Howard: Each form has a universal goal-- the need for total concentration and precision timing, the very attributes that underline the well-conditioned, well-disciplined athlete. ( slow music plays ) ( sword rattles ) ( grunts ) ( all grunt ) ( grunting, screaming ) Howard: From the rigorous training sessions to feats of strength, men and women all over the world, whether they be martial artists or not, are constantly testing their mind and body control. In an exhibition hall in China, men and women display some of their talents. ( music plays ) Howard: Perhaps one aspect of the martial arts that most people bring to mind is the ability to break objects, a cinderblock with a chop of the fists or a two-inch-thick board with the butt of the forehead, just about anything with just about any part of the body. And here again is Togo the Great, master of karate. ( dramatic music plays ) ( grunts ) ( applause ) Show host: ...turns their hand into almost an ax or a hatchet. The edge of the hand is calloused and hard. This is a granite rock, not any prop rock at all. -( applause ) -Look at that. This is painful to watch. Even the toes are used as a weapon. ( grunts ) ( applause ) And that slashing side of the hand. ( applause ) Of course force enough to break a man's neck. And now two boards in thickness. The fist is a battering ram. ( applause ) Even the head. The training, almost... battering ram here. Watch. ( grunts ) ( applause ) Togo the Great giving a live demonstration from an early TV show, and it was television that really introduced the martial arts to the mainstream American audience. Though the martial artist was used in supporting roles with not much opportunity to showcase his ability, an audience, however small, had begun to take notice. From the simple notion that a man could break a board with his bare fist to the breathtaking displays of showmanship, the martial artist embodies precision and power. Their seemingly effortless flips and leaps you watch are the results of years of training and conditioning. They are both skilled martial artists and incredible acrobats, capable of feats that would test the world's best gymnasts. Like the skyhook of a Kareem Abdul Jabbar or the leap of Nureyev, the martial artist has his own style, his own signature. No better has this poetry in motion and exemplified than in the movies. ( music plays ) Howard: From the solid foundation of traditional martial art forms, the movies gave birth to these wonderful permutations, these supercharged feats of motion, but at the same time, tradition was to be tested by yet another change. ( yelps ) Howard; The notion of the typically soft-spoken, subservient woman was to end. The dramatic presence of women in the martial arts had arrived.

( echoing ) ♪ Karate Man! ( song fades ) Howard: Lacking in the muscular development that the men possessed, women often used more ballet-like movements in their fight sequences. ( yipping, grunting ) Howard: One thing was certain, though-- women were capable fighters, able to take on the great challenges. They also personified many aspects of the martial arts-- the beautiful but deadly, the graceful leaping. And the crushing force of a fist. Damn you! ( groans ) Women were a welcomed addition to the martial art film. Weapons-- the martial artist has a wide variety in his arsenal. Here, Carter Wong, Grand Master of yan ji pai style and one of his students display a routine with double hooks and butterfly knives. ( shouts ) ( grunting ) ( exhales forcefully ) Howard: Martial art weapons range from the simple to the exotic. Take for example the simple wooden pole. With the right technique, it can be a lethal weapon. ( painful grunting ) I'm... I'm so sorry. You bloody old fool! ( groans ) Get him! ( grunting, groaning ) ( pole swooshing ) Howard: With its alluring beauty, the fan is another deceptive weapon. Having steel rods in its ribbing, one well-placed blow could render a man unconscious. Here, Carter Wong, the Grand Master of the yan ji pai style, displays his graceful ability with weaponry. ( music plays ) The traditional use of weapons is yet another example of the martial arts that have spring boarded into the movies. Weapons have been incorporated into fantastic expressions of grace and action, and supercharged scenes of kinetic energy are testimonies to the martial artist's power and creative intensity. The martial art movie is similar to the Western or the adventure film in so much to say that there are films, and then there are classics, those memorable moments when one man stands against another, when our hero is either victorious or immortalized in his brave pursuit of justice, honor, and often love. But like so many films, different aspects of action are woven into the plots to create yet another dimension of excitement. Today, some of the martial art films being produced use chase scenes, gimmicks, and often comedy. These mixtures are far from a traditional approach but one that is by no means less exciting. ( men shouting ) Get him! Come on! - Sir, run! -Look out! -Get him! -Come on! -Hey! -Hey! Stop him! ( yells ) Howard: What would an action movie be without gimmicks and comedy to help set up the fighting and stunts? The martial art movie has both. ( yells ) ( whimpering ) Huh? ( whimpering ) What happened? You couldn't do it. Take it down and have a look at it. ( laughter ) Oh, it's hot. Howard: Here, Bruce Lei shows us his comedic style, which, as you'll see, takes nothing away from his fighting ability. You there. Huh? Where are you from? Well, where do you think? Huh? What's that? I just asked you where you come from. Stupid fool. Stupid fool? Only a stupid fool would call someone a stupid fool. Are you an imbecile? I find that very insulting! Do you want to die? Sir, do you wanna fight? I'll gladly fight you. - Come on then! - Wah! ( chuckles softly ) ( grunting ) Christ, that's hot! Yeah, that's really hot! ( grunting, groaning ) ( grunting ) Ah! Ow! ( whimpering ) ( yells ) Ohh! ( both shouting, grunting ) Goodbye. Huh? Hey! Hey! Untie me! Hey! Hey! Untie me first! Bye! Come back! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, come back! ( cane tapping ) Howard: Whether it be comedy or suspense, the artful use of deception, or a tense cat-and-mouse game, the martial artist must stand ready, his reflexes sharp, his fighting fierce. Though there are numerable one-on-one confrontations in the martial arts, often, the warrior finds himself up against great odds. One-on-one is hardly a challenge for the martial arts warrior. It takes five, six, and sometimes more opponents to test his abilities. Huh? ( blades swooshing ) You coward. ( vocalizing ) ( music plays ) She's just gone to bed. Don't worry. Howard: Jimmy Wang Yu, perhaps the biggest martial arts movie star before Bruce Lee came onto the scene. In this film, he faces seemingly insurmountable odds. Portraying a one-time karate champion who now refuses to fight anymore, he falls in love with a woman who comes to him for help, help that would avenge her father's murder. Come on! Though he is taunted and often tested, he cannot fight. Why don't you help us? We fight for justice. Before my father died, he asked me not to kill anymore. I must remember this. Howard: But when violence comes to his own home, his own mother, the warrior rises up in him. It's me! Mother! Howard: There will be no stopping Jimmy Wang Yu until he avenges his mother's death. Someone will have to pay, whether it's one man... or a hundred. Man: He's surrounded. He's finished. Hey, listen! He's the one boss wants to get! Don't let him get away! Come on! ( all shouting and grunting ) You killed my mother! You'll pay with your blood! Both: Ahhhh! ( whimpering ) ( groaning ) ( music plays ) Well, one thing about the martial arts I guess we can all agree on is that they're pretty amazing. Those men and women who hold tradition in one hand and showmanship in the other, for them, no challenge is too great, no feat too amazing. So the next time you think about the martial arts, your mind may wander from grandmasters to movie stars, from the serious to the fantastic, but hopefully, the one impression that the "Amazing Masters of the Martial Arts" leaves you with is fun, that irresistible urge to grin and say, "Hey, I like this." ( dance beat plays ) ( dance beat fades ) ( suspenseful music plays ) ( dance beat plays ) Man talking to the beat: Now they came from a land from long ago. And they used their hands in deadly blows. Some people call it karate. Some call it kung fu. The art of motion, the masters. With blazing fists of fury and death-defying leaps, the martial arts masters did superhuman feats. Ah, they right the wrongs, the samurai, the ninjas, karate warriors. With swords and stars, flips and kicks, they slice through the air with their bag of tricks Now there's the dragon, the tiger, the snake, and the claw, the cobra, the mantis, the five fingers of death. Don't mess with no ninja. It's no contest. Now they came from a land long ago. And they used their hands in deadly blows. It has many names, but it's all the same. It's action-packed, and that's the name of the game. Don't mess with no ninja. It's no contest. It's no contest. No contest. No contest. ( music continues )
