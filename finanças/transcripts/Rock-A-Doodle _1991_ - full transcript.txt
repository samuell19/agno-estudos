[narrator] Once upon a time, back before I knew how to tie my shoes, the sun came up. Now, I know an everyday sunrise may not seem like such a big deal to some folks, but imagine for a moment if instead of rising up, like this, one morning where you lived she took a look around and decided to go back to sleep. It happened once to us. Let me tell you all about it... [Chanticleer] ♪ Cock-a-doo ♪ ♪ Hoo hoo hoo hoo ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Yo-da-lay-ee ♪ ♪ Cock-a-doo what a day ♪ ♪ The sun is shinin' brightly ♪ ♪ Cock-a-doo sunny day ♪ ♪ Down here on the farm ♪ ♪ Cock-a-doo stay away ♪ ♪ You big ole Wet ole rain cloud ♪ ♪ Or I'll cry out loud With this voice of mine ♪ [narrator] This was our rooster,Chanticleer. And though it was true that he liked to horse around some, the fact was, that boy could sing! ♪ Sun, sun, sun Sun do shine, sun do shine ♪ ♪ Well, my daddy Taught me how to sing ♪ ♪ And that's why This voice means everything ♪ [narrator] We all had our jobs on the farm, and Chanticleer's was to wake up the sun. and when he crowed, up she came! Hey, look, here's me tyin' my shoes. Hi, Patou. Whatcha doin'? I'm tryin' to tie these doggone shoes! Huh! Again? Well, hi, ladies. Oh, he's so handsome! He sings like a dream! He is a dream. And he's single, too! [Patou] He maybe wasn't the smartest bird that ever lived, but when he crowed, there was plenty of peace and harmony. Hey! Well, plenty of harmony, anyway. And lots of sunshine! ♪ Well, my daddy Taught me how to sing ♪ ♪ That's why this voice Means everything ♪ ♪ Sun do shine You better shine ♪ ♪ Well, the sun do shine You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ -♪ You better shine ♪ ♪ You better shine ♪ ♪ Sun, you better shine ♪ ♪ Dik-a-dik-ca Ca-dik-a-dik-a-down-down ♪ [all laughing] [Patou] There was no doubt about it, old Chanticleer kept us animals up and shining. [all] Good day, Mr. Chanticleer. But all that was about to change. One morning, before Chanticleer was even awake, -a stranger snuck onto our farm... -Hey, Chanticleer! ...to stop Chanticleer from crowing! Of course, Chanticleer wouldn't give up without a fight. But what he didn't know was that this stranger had been sent by the Grand Duke of Owls. A nasty fella. The good news here was that Chanticleer had won the fight. The bad news was the Grand Duke's bully had done his dirty deed. For in all the commotion, Chanticleer had plum forgot to crow, and the sun was comin' up without him. [animals gasp] When Chanticleer saw this, it broke his heart. He reckoned maybe his crow never did raise the sun. Look! It's comin' up without him! You're a phony! [man] He's a fake! Hey, everybody, cock-a-doodle-doo! The Grand Duke's evil plan had worked. He had turned us against our very best friend. And without a reason to crow, poor Chanticleer left the farm to look for work in the city. Then came the rain, and our troubles with the Duke. [Edmond] Who's that, Mom? [Mother] That's the Grand Duke. He's the one who's causing all the trouble. He sent that mean old rooster to Chanticleer's farm to pick a fight. Hmm. How come? Because he didn't like Chanticleer doing all that crowing and bringing up the sun. How come? Well, like most owls, he likes the darkness and the rain. I'm not afraid of the dark. [gasping] Oh, it's you! You scared me! Dorie, we got big problems. Have you looked out there? If that rain doesn't stop, we're all gonna go floatin' down the river! [Patou] This is my favorite part of the story. His name is Edmond. 'Course, he didn't look quite like this when I first met him. Anyhow, we weren't the only folks havin' our troubles. Poor Edmond's family was havin' their share, too. The river's rising too fast! We've got to reinforce the sandbags! You think that'll work? We'll make it work. I'll get the boys. Me, too! You stop right there. Oh, Mom, I'm one of the boys. He meant the big boys. I'm big enough. Not yet you're not, darling. [radio] The U.S. Weather bureau is expecting another night of disastrous downpour in the areas worst hit by this week's flooding. [Dad] Scott! Mark! Bring the truck around to the front! Come on, guys, move it, I need some help. We gotta get the animals inside. [Patou] So while Scott and Mark got to help protect the house against the flood, poor Edmond was left behind where he'd be safe and out of trouble. It's my house, too. I want to help. Then pray for the rain to stop, and that will help. [Dad] Dorie, I can't find the flashlight! Coming. Now, you stay here where it's safe, pumpkin. I'm gonna help your father. I'll be right back. Great, let's go. Dad, they said on the radio the National Guard might come. I am too one of the big boys! [Edmond reading] And without a reason to crow, Chanticleer left the farm. Then came the rain... Mom, here! How is she, Frank? Start the truck! She'll be okay! Dorie, hurry! I know the answer. We need Chanticleer! Mom! Boys, the levee's breaking! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! [Patou] Edmond had the right idea to call for Chanticleer, but he never could have guessed who was going to answer... Chanticleer? No... It's not Chanticleer. Who are you? You put your finger in the Duke's face. Remember? These are expensive, little brat! But that is not why the Duke is going to eat you. Eat me? Oh, dear, now I've gone and spoiled the surprise. I'm always doing that. But, you see, we creatures of the night have worked very hard to make absolutely sure that that bird does not return. And you... You, with no regard for the feelings of others, have the nerve to call him back here by name! And besides, I positively loathe rock 'n' roll! [laughs boisterously] You're not gonna eat me! [Patou] And that's when the Duke hit the ceiling! If Edmond wanted to bring Chanticleer back to raise the sun, the Duke was going to have something to say about it. Kittens are more digestible. Young Edmond was about to have the most amazing adventure he'd ever dreamed of. [laughs] [The Duke laughing] Ah... Mom! Dad! Wake me up! This is where I come in! Ow! Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi! You'll pay for this, Patou! This does not concern you. It does if it's about Chanti! The light! Owls hate the light! [screams] Whew! Hey, boy. We were this close! Oh, that flashlight biz was quick thinking on your part! What's your name, little fella? Edmond. Is he gone? Yeah, he's gone, but he'll be back. And he won't be alone, the coward. I would have whopped him if I'd of had my shoes tied! But you know something? Tying shoes is harder than dry dog food. What you wearing shoes for? Bunions! I got a load of bunions. And them shoes help my feet. Here, let me show you how to tie them. Oh, jeepers! I'm all furry! Well, kittens are furry. But, but I'm a little boy! [meows] Did that come out of me? Oh! I'm... I'm a cat! He turned me into a cat! Help me! Do something! I can't be a cat! I'm a boy! Patou, what will I do? Alright, steady, boy, keep your pants on. [gasps] Yuck! What am I doing? I'm licking myself! [Peepers] Patou! I'm in here! According to my calculations, this can't possibly be the city. Let's see, 36 by 7 southeast... Thirty-six by 77... Or is it 37 by 6? [gasps] [chuckles] It's okay, Peepers! It's Edmond, he's a nice kid. I'm a boy! And I almost ate a mouse! I must be crazy! You bet your sweet whiskers! Wow! [Stuey] There's no city around here. Oh, sadness! Hey, aren't you going to tie my shoes? I can't! I can't help anybody! I'm too little! I'm a scrawny fur-ball runt! Mom and Dad won't even recognize me! Mom! Dad! Help! [thunder crashes] Oh, Chanticleer. If he doesn't come back and crow, the sun won't ever shine again, and the rain will keep coming down, and the water will get higher and higher, until we all drown. Wowee wow wow wow! Are we close? Are we near the city? Us magpies are just made for the city! Come on, already! Hurry it up, Peepers! We're not looking for the city! We're looking for Chanticleer. Well, he's in the city, isn't he? Then he is in the city! Girls, they think they know everything! Why don't you run home, be a mousewife? Make cheese? [lisps] Snipes, you think you're so superior! "Thuperior!" Nithe lithp! My lisp isolates and elevates me and makes me a rare specimen. [Snipes and Peepers argue] Pipe down, you two! The story's true! You all laughed at him, and he went away! You're right, son. We done wrong! And that's why we're searching for the city. We got to find Chanti and apologize. So he'll forgive us. Come home and raise the sun! Well, I know where the city is. I've been there lots of times as a boy. A boy? Before that big owl turned me into a cat! Owl? Owl? Edmond, would you take us to the city? I can't. Look at me, I'm a cat. No, a little kitty. What can I do? I can do lots of things, and I'm a lot smaller than you. And furthermore, I could forgive you for being a cat if you would take us to the city. Of course, if you're a fraidy-cat-- I'm not afraid! Or a scaredy-cat. Me, scared? Lay off the boy! Hey, guys! Guys! Okay, okay! I'm not afraid of anything! I'll take you to the city to find Chanticleer! And bring him home, and save Dad and Mom and the farm! [all] Hurray! Hope you can swim, guys. [Edmond] Oh, no! [coughing] Ahhh! We don't have to swim! We'll go by boat! Oh, this is serious! Peepers, you'll need this if those owls return! Owls? Owls? Owls? I'm sticking with you! -Well, fellas, this is it! -[gulps] [Snipes] The city! The lights! The chicks! The food! Goodbye! Good luck with the owls! Owls? [Patou] Yep, owls. While Edmond set our course for the city in the U.S.S. Toybox, the Duke and his owls were back in their lair storing up some powerful nasty weather... [organ music plays] So he turns on the Duke. And with what, do you suppose, he turns on the Duke?

[Patou] You ever get that feeling when you're looking for something that it's right under your sniffer? I know it seems crazy, but it was almost like we could hear his voice calling to us. You know, like he was just waiting for us to come and ask him back. But we looked everywhere, and we talked with everyone. But nobody had heard of Chanticleer, nobody. Funny thing was, he was right under our very nose the whole time. Or, should I say, we were under his.

They want to bring Chanticleer back to the farm. You don't want that. He makes you lots of money. I don't want that. He makes me miserable. [Pinky] Right, boss. What should I do about it?

Which was exactly the way Pinky wanted it, because that was exactly the way the Grand Duke wanted it.

Where are they? They're in Pinky's trailer. Outside. Mark it. Twenty-two-A, take two. [Chanticleer] Oh, yeah! [Pinky] Action! Hang on, honey! [Pinky] That's not in the script! Stop those birds! Get 'em! Get 'em! There it is! Annihilation! Abomination! Hold still! Ow! [Goldie screaming] Watch out, King! Whoa! Oh, no! No! I've killed him! Chanticleer! Hi, fellas. He's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! Hey, fellas, I'm sorry about this. Jumpin' Jehoshaphat! He's not dead. Untie me! Oh, no! Let's get him out of here! Through there! Oh, no! Not Pinky's Caddy! Can you drive a car? Piece of cake. Edmond, you steer. Steer? I can't! I've never driven a car! -Edmond, do it! -We'll crash! Don't be such a fraidy-cat! [car starts] Hey! [engine whirring] Whoa! Whoa! [tires screech] Edmond, open your eyes! Uh-oh! Look! Ha! Abomination! Ow! Come on, Edmond! We're gonna lose that trailer! How? -Edmond, cats are climbers! -I'm a boy! -Just climb down there-- -What? I can't! -Don't be such a sissy! -I'll fall! You're a cat! You won't fall! I will! Oh, I'll do it myself! You're such a scaredy-cat! Right. Here we go. Ahhh! Edmond! Patou, help! Hold on! Ahhh! Help! Peepers! [Peepers] Of course, if you're a fraidy-cat... [Edmond] I'm not afraid of anything! [Patou] Hey, lay off the boy... Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat... [laughing] No! Stop! Guys, we're gonna go back and get her! They want to play chicken, eh? Don't worry, boss, I ain't turning! Idiot! That's my car! Whoa! Snipes, the brake! [tires screeching] I think she landed up here! Peepers! Come on, we gotta find her! [whimpers] Oh, my baby! My beautiful baby! What are you looking at?

This is a Sikorski X-62, and these things are crazy! The King is gone, and I'm ruined! [Pinky crying] Oh, no, no, no! Oh, yes, yes, yes! Ahhh! Gentlemen, go down and invite our friends to dinner.

Chanti, you're home. Huh? [thunder crackles] [Chanticleer] Ooh, feels like I've been hit with by an 800-pound mule. -What's happened? -There's no time to explain. Chanticleer, you got to crow, and you got to crow now! The owls could be here any second! Who are you? He's a friend. Now please, crow! Oh. I can't. I don't know if I ever did. Of course you did! Chanti, we were wrong. It's your job to bring up the sun. It hasn't shined since you left. But look. Cock-a-doo... Ooh... Uh-oh! Oh, guys, it's no use. All I do now is sing the blues. [scoffs] The King. We don't want The King, we want Chanticleer! [all gasp] The Duke! [growling] [clears throat] [all laughing] I know it's frightfully impolite to eavesdrop like this, but are you, by any chance, having a little trouble with your throat? Nothing to say? Hmm? Cock-a-doodle-do? Stop it! Chanti! Crow! Shut up, you! Come on, you guys! Show him we believe! I told you to be quiet! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticl-- Duke, leave him alone. It's me you want, not him! [groans] [laughing maniacally] [thunder rumbling] Chanticleer. Chanticleer. Very stupid, Patou. Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer. Now, look here, quiet! [all] Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Chanticleer! Fools! All of you, silence! I'll give you Chanticleer! [all chanting "Chanticleer"] [The Duke laughing] [continues laughing] [man] It's coming up without him! You're a phony! [The Duke] Are you by any chance having trouble with your throat? [man] You're a phony! It's coming up without him! [Edmond] It's your job to bring up the sun! [Peepers] It hasn't shined since you left! It's your job to bring up the sun... It hasn't shined since you left! [Patou] Chanticleer, you got to crow, and you got to crow now! [The Duke] Cock-a-doodle-do?

Altercation! Wow! [Patou] Well, our journey had finally come to an end. Old Chanticleer was back to stay, the sun was up, the rain had stopped, and the owls were gone for good. Everything seemed to be turning out just fine. Except for one thing... Edmond. We just didn't know how to help him. He was a little boy! Oh, he was a handsome little boy. Edmond... Edmond... -Edmond... -[Mother] Edmond... Edmond... Edmond... Edmond... Edmond, come on, honey, wake up. Wake up, honey. Mom... Mom! [gasps] Look, I'm not furry anymore! Lie down, sweetheart. -Mom, is that the sun? -Mmm-hmm. Edmond... Edmond, get back into bed. Wow! Okay, take a look. Look, Mom, Chanticleer raised the sun! Hi, Edmond! How ya doing, son? [Edmond] Fine! But what happened to Chanti and the gang? Mom, where are they? Edmond, Chanticleer is just a storybook. Those characters are only make-believe! Now, come on, let's get back into bed. No, mom! No, they're not! I saw them! I bet they're wondering what happened to me. I want to tell them I'm okay. -I'm sure they know. -You think so? Mmm-hmm. They'll be just fine. [Patou] Edmond's mom was right, of course, but she didn't know why. She also never knew just what stopped the rain that night. But that just goes to show you, with a little help from your friends, you can do just about anything. Welcome home, Chanticleer.
