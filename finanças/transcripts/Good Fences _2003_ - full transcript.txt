[car horn honking][Kids] Daddy's home! ♪ Nothing but blue sky ♪ Look straight ahead Tom, what did you do? What does it look like I did? I bought us a new car. Does this mean you got the promotion? No. This is how I'm gonna get it, sweetheart. What do you mean, this is how you're gonna get it, honey? Can't you see? This car shouts, "I am not the sort of automobile driven by a man content to rot in the basement doing legal research." I was law review, third in my class. This sort of car reminds them of that. [engine starts, backfires]Oh! Oh! Tom![engine revs] Do all Italian cars do that? Maybe it's trying to talk to us in smoke signals. Now hop on in the car. I'm taking the family to Sizzler. [both] Yeah! [laughing] That tickles. [Man] You're the one read it in Cosmo. I know, but I didn't know it was gonna tickle. Here. Let me get the baby toe right here, baby.Okay. Let me get the one. Let's see. Here.Get it. [laughing][laughs] I got it. [blowing] [laughter continues] Whoo!Ooh. You like that blowing, don't you?I do. Hey, did you ever hear about that job from the Urban League? Oh, the nincompoops gave it to some boojy moron from Harvard. What?Yeah. I'm sorry.Ah, don't be. Something else came up that might... I don't wanna say anything about it right now, but it just might change everything. What you mean, you don't wanna say nothing about it now? Come on now. You're being a spy. Not a spy.You gonna be Tom the Spy? What happened?No, no, baby girl. Yesterday, Sullivan himself came down to my dungeon. [gasps]Yeah. And he was hinting, you know? It's not ideal, but, baby, it may be the crack in the wall we've been praying for. Oh, Tom, that's wonderful. Now...Now what? Now you know what. Now you know what. I just wanna--I'm not-- It's-- I know what you want. I know what you want.I want that toe to kick up and hit that ceiling. Well, you have to do the both of them. You make it hard for a man.Well, that's the idea. Get on down there and do the rest of my toes.All right. Come on, baby. Blend for Mama. Hurry, ladies. She's about to tell him. Coming! [Man on TV] Why the sudden formality? Come on, come on, come on.Wait, wait, wait. Hurry up. I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh. Oh. [Woman] That's exactly my point, Doctor. I don't love you anymore. I love Dr. Quartermain, and I'm keeping his baby. [all laughing] I tell you, I didn't think she would do it. I didn't think she would do it. As fine as Dr. Q is, I would've told my trifling Ray after the first kiss. Oh, really?Yeah. Hey, I'm home! Hey-- Hey, baby. Hey, I'm on television. I'm on television. I'm on television. [Mother] What do you mean, on television? I'm at the courthouse. Me, Joe Klein, of course Sullivan and the rest of the partners. All right. Here it is. [Man] Our top story again tonight is the Vickswell Avenue blaze. Despite sworn statements from three eyewitnesses, Thomas Spader, the attorney for the accused, had this to say. My client acted in self-defense. Just look at Joe Klein's face. See it twist just because some son of a bitch wants to hear from a black man. Son of a bitch. [chuckling]Son of a bitch. Stormy! [Man] Well, the accused arsonist, Dr. Harold Silver, a successful periodontist and owner of several low-income housing units, has admitted to setting the blaze that sent two black teens to the burn unit at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Doctors say those burns are so extensive that the risk of infection is still very much a factor, I'm starving. and the next 24 hours will be critical.Who wants to eat? [Kids] I do. The mothers of the two boys and several neighbors have set up a candlelight vigil. [thinking] Sweet Jesus, keep me near the cross. May I please be excused? Carol Burnett's about to start.Absolutely. Me, too. May I please be excused, too?Yes. Yes. Make sure you rinse your plates off. Thanks, Mom. That guy on TV knew my name. He called me Attorney Spader. [applause on TV] How about that? Mmm. [chuckles]What? Come on.[patting leg] [laughing][mouths word] Come on.Stop. I'm too heavy. You're light as a feather, baby. The kids are here. They're looking at Carol Burnett. Come on. [laughter] Tom. Tom, Tom. You know, I just can't stop thinking about those boys. Mmm.Why they got you doing this? They ain't got me doing anything. I've been rotting at that firm for nine years now, watching all the Joe Kleins, the Michael Ferraros, the Ernest O'Connors pack up their desks and move upstairs. Well, I'm goddamn good and tired of holding my breath. This is my job. This is what I've been trained to do. Baby, we've had to make hard decisions like this all the time in law school. This is just another one of those tests. And putting my client in jail is not gonna help those boys heal. This is the hand we were dealt. And, little girl, I swear to you, before my family, I'm gonna win with it. Tommy-Two, you can go over to Robbie's house if you want to, but if Mrs. Sanchez starts asking you any more questions about your father's trial, you tell her you don't know. Yes, Mom.A lot of nerve asking a child about this thing. Come on, Stormy. Mommy, why do the boys at school call Steve O'Dell Little One Ball? Is it 'cause he only has one testicle? Sometimes I understand why animals eat their young. Ow, ow, ow! It stings, Mommy! What stings, Stormy? There's nothing but water in your hair. You're just acting. [Woman] Mabel? Yeah. He's on TV again. Who is on TV again, Tina? Tom.[TV clicks on] [Man] Yesterday's peaceful demonstration turned ugly as darkness fell and looters began making off with thousands of dollars worth of merchandise before setting a Caldor's on fire. Attorney for the accused arsonist in this case had this to say. [Tom] Hooligans are using the tragedyIt's Daddy. of these misguided young men to take what's not theirs. Now, their actions are just as childish as my children, and like children, need an appropriate punishment. Is it true you've even received death threats over this case? Mabel, why didn't you tell me? Some crank calls from a few desperate and confused scoundrels. That may be the case, but we have learned that two New Haven police officers have been assigned to guard your law office. I'm wondering about your family. How are they holding up through this ordeal? [Tom] All the members of my family are strong troopers. We come from strong stock, and we won't let any trashy rascals cow us into bowing our heads. That is Attorney Tom Spader. He is the attorney for the accused doctor accused of arson and now manslaughter in this highly divisive and contentious case. [rain falling] [car approaches] Why didn't you tell me about the death threats? Don't worry, sweetheart. The police tell me there's always a couple in a case like this. Now go back to sleep. [sighs] [phone ringing] Larry, did you find the precedent? [Man speaking, faint] Better watch it. I got my eye on you. [continues, faint] You listen to me, you stupid son of a bitch. You call here again, and I will find you and break you in half. Our people-- Don't you dare tell me about our people. My people know the difference between right and wrong and are proud of the few of us in a position of responsibility. Your people are obviously ignorant chimpanzees still swinging from the trees! [phone clangs loudly] Mabel? Oh. Go back to bed, sweetheart. I'm fine. How long, Tom? Oh, I'll be up an hour or two. That's not what I meant. Oh, well, you know, the trial will start Monday. It shouldn't last more than a week. Don't you worry. All the fools are gonna crawl back under the rocks they came from. Now, baby, get some sleep. [scoffs] [sighs] I don't see why we need to makeLet go. this stupid table bigger. It's not like anybody else is coming.Stormy! [gasps] The leaf in the table lets you know it's a holiday, right? Dear Lord, thank you for this food we are about to receive on this Thanksgiving for the nourishment of our bodies and our souls. Amen. [Mabel, Kids] Amen. Stormy made the turkey. She did?Mm-hmm. [Woman] The district manager-- he says he can see Joe taking his place in just a couple of years. Mmm. Joe-- has he been, uh, working out? [purrs] I saw him washing the car the other day, [Tina] Oh, no....and it looked like he was gonna bust right out of his shirt, but it stayed on. Oh, I was really hot. Luisa, you need to watch her. Oh, whatever. You're having sex. I haven't had any in a couple years. Let's talk about something else. I'm gonna say what I said to you last year, 'cause I'm not good at this hard sell, and-- Yeah, you're pretty bad at that. I use the products. They're just as good as the name-brand products. They're not as expensive, which is also a plus. And, uh, if you decide you wanna buy some this year, wonderful. If you decide you don't wanna buy some this year, that's fine, too. I'm just very happy to have you all here. You know, with, uh... Especially with the trial, you know? To Mabel. Well, you can put me down for that detergent. I love the way it makes my sheets smell. Isn't that what Ray's supposed to say about you?Don't worry about Ray. Did you get that yeast infection taken care of? Why do you have to bring it up in front of ev-- What's wrong with you? You were scratching.It was a minor rash. [doorbell rings]I'll get it. Hector. You looking for your mommy? Papi says, um, come home now. That bastard's got that racist bastard off. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mabel. Joe, he-- What? He got off?Oh. Why this restaurant? And tonight of all nights? I mean, this is so public. That's the point, my love. We're here to celebrate. [Tommy-Two] Is Daddy a famous genius now? [Tom] Why, yes, Handsome Harry, he is. Tommy-Two, slow down. You're acting like you never ate cake before. [muffled] Never had cake and my own steak before.Oh! And your mouth is full. Leave the boy in peace. He's just excited. Did you see what was in his mouth? Cake? You know, Dr. Spock never raised black children. That's all I'm saying. Check, please. Oh, uh, the gentleman over there took care of it. Well, I'll be goddamned. 99 percent positive that they'll start a criminal division, and I'm it, honey. Yeah?Yeah. In a year from now, I'll be a partner.Ooh! In three years from now, I'll be a judge.Ooh! You can go on and enroll that boy in karate class.Oh! Oh, Tom! Tom!Yeah. Then go back down to Malley's and get that purse, okay?The purse? Which purse, Tom? What purse, Tom?Oh, yeah! Tell me which one!The alli-- Alligator!Yeah, get the alligator. I want the alligator! I want two! [mumbles] Two! Two purses![grunting] I want two purse-- I want two purse-- Oh, get two. Get two, baby. I want two purses.Oh, baby. Oh, little girl. Tom?Shh. Yeah. Tom?Yeah. Honey?Oh, yeah, baby. Can I get some shoes? [Boy] Quizzical. Q-U-I- Z-I-C-A-L. Quizzical. I'm sorry, Lyle, but it's incorrect. Your turn. [clears throat] Quizzical. Q-U-I- Z-Z-I-C-A-L. Quizzical.Yes. That is correct. [gasps] [panting] Tom. Tom, honey, it's not real anymore. Go on back to sleep. I keep telling you, it's not real anymore. Go on back to sleep now. Come on. Lay down. All right. [bell tolling] [no audible dialogue] [gasps] [chuckles] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! [gasps] Hi, baby. Hello, baby. [laughs] Oh, hi! Open up for Mama. Oh! [dishes clattering] [sniffing] [Woman] Yes, I've seen her rosebuds blossom. But they've been sticking out like that for a year now. Where you been? And how many boys have come sniffing around here? You tall me that! Dark and ashy as she is, don't hold your breath waiting for some man to come around here and take her out of your hair anytime soon. [Man] Shut up, woman. Plenty gals good and married in this town dealt a worse deck than she was. Ain't that Pea-Pie always sniffing around her, acting fool-- [chattering] Get outta the way. Okay, Pea-Pie. There you go. Thank you there, sir. Aw, y'all see my money? Don't forget you owe me 2.50.Yee! He owe me three.Pea-Pie owe me two bits now. There's my girl. Mabel!Oh, Pea-Pie, that girl don't want you. Mabel! Hello, Pea-Pie. Mabel, Mabel, that new James Dean movie's in town. Yeah. And it's playing at the drive-in. I mean, I know I ain't got a car or nothing, but we could sure sit on my shoeshine box--[truck backfires] [chickens clucking][backfires] Who's that? Mabel! Hey, you! Get him, Pea-Pie.Go on. Kick his butt, Pea-Pie. Kick his butt. [Pea-Pie] I'm talking to you, boy. You know he can't fight. I got cousins who think they tough like you, and they ain't nothing neither.Get him, Pea-Pie! I'm gonna knock you down a peg, boy,Kick his butt. and then I'm gonna hang you from the nearest tree. [Boys] Oh! [Boys yelling] Any of the rest of you so dumb as to follow him? You fight like a woman.You can't fight. [laughter, chatter] [clatter][Movers chatting] So, they put you in charge, did they? [chuckles]You must be praying they don't break any of the lamps. Well, it's kind of too late for that now. But I must tell you, this move was not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm Mrs. Bonner. I live in the house next door. This is Quentin. I'm Mabel Spader. Pleased to meet you. [chuckles] [sighs] So, well, this is Quentin. Hi. When do they arrive? Who?The family. Oh, they're already here. They're unpacking. They're inside. [glass shatters]Oh. [Mover]Oh, man!Damn it. Will you excuse me?[Mover #2] Doesn't sound good. Just tell them that Mrs. Jean Bonner in the house next door just can't wait to meet them. Well, all right, then.[chuckles] [chuckling] Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [chuckles] Bye-bye. Bye. [sighs] Come on, Quentin. It's just like you're holding-- see-- two pencils at the same time. Daddy, I'm starving.Mmm. Tom, you don't need to teach him how to use those now. The boy's been helping me unpack all day. Angel, we're in the big leagues now. He's gonna have to learn to do a lot more than just use chopsticks. Daddy. [sighs] Here. There's no Luisa Rodriguez around here. There are hardly any Jews. These are the Whitneys and the Biddles, the last names you see on buildings. Tom, I'm sure they put their pants on one leg at a time just like us. We all worship the same God. Sweet pea, that reminds me. He goes to the Episcopal church right down the street. We're Baptist. Uh-uh. Darling, the nearest Baptist church is all the way over in Bridgeport. [thinking] Sweet Jesus, keep me near the cross. And you said it yourself. It's the same God. Look, you know, it's a great way to get to know the neighbors. Just try it. If you don't like it, we'll-- we'll attend somewhere else, okay? All right. Mmm. Mmm. [Man yelling, distant][clatter] [Woman speaking, faint] [yelling continues] [clatter]Hey. Hey, babe. What's happening? What's going on?[blow lands] It's that odd woman from next door. She came to say hello today.[Jean] I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry! Tom, I think he's trying to kill her. We should call the police. If calling the police would help, one of the other neighbors would've done it years ago. [sighing][yelling continues] Come on back to bed, baby. [Mr. Bonner] Get your hands off me!No! Don't you touch-- [sobbing]Get out! Go on! [bell ringing] You know Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Yep. Do you know Walt Frazier? Yep. Flip Wilson?No. Miss Jane Pittman? Yeah.[Boys] Wow! Can I touch your hair? I've got almost all the David Cassidy bubblegum cards. [gasps] Cool!Really? Wow. That's great. [Eastern European accent] I was six years with the Blakes. Ten years with the Hamiltons. [Spanish accent] Six years with the Talbots. I'll call them and let you know. Okay. Thank you.Thank you. I'm not just talking about college. I'm talking law school, and then law offices all over the state. Folks waving at me. White folks I don't even know waving and smiling and seeing my name. Yes, sir, Miss Mabel Johnson, what you're looking at is the man who's gonna single-handedly end the colored man's losing streak. I know you will, Tom. I knew it the first time I laid eyes on you. You did? Mm-hmm.You did? I'm telling you, baby, I'm a rocket, and you're my fuel. [Man on TV] Our lives are not our own. They're merely streams that we step into for the short while that we breathe air on this sweet earth. I am not the brave hero that I thought that I would grow up to be. I am just your average cardiothoracic surgeon at a medium-sized teaching hospital doing his damnedest to try to save some lives. Yet there is one thing-- Why didn't you tell me our stories was on? Shh. Dr. Peter's about to propose. That is you, Nurse Rebecca. Will you marry me? [Nurse Rebecca] I will! Ooh, I can't believe it! I told you. I told you. I knew it. I don't know why she said she would. She know what she like. She don't know about him.[laughing] Say, listen, you know, there's gonna be about six of those women from the PTA coming over here. I don't know why he wants you to start entertaining so soon. You barely moved in here. I think it's because he wants us to show them that we really care about the education of our children. And a cup of tea is gonna do all of that? Well, I don't know about that. But what's worrying me is, what am I gonna feed them? I mean, I don't know what these people eat. You know, they don't seem like chip-'n-dip kind of gals. I tell you what. You get some white bread, slap some mayonnaise on it, put some cucumbers on it, cut the crusts off and cut it up real small. They'll never know the difference. White bread, mayonnaise, and cucumbers? That's what I'm talking about. Mm-mm. [chattering] Aahhhhh! [no audible dialogue] [Butcher] Mrs. Winslow, what'll it be? The usual. Two T-bones and a pound of bacon. I was--If Bucky doesn't get his T-bone, he's not a happy camper. Hey, well, I got some beautiful ones right here. Look how nice and marbled.Oh, lovely. Ma'am, this is a $5 bill. [Women laughing][Woman] I know. [doorbell rings] [laughing stops] [laughing resumes] Oh!Miss Spader's expecting you. [Women] Oh! Ladies. Mrs. Spader. Mabel.Oh. M-Mabel. Of course. I'm Binky Goodyear. Becka Rainier. [laughs] Oh, we met last year at the A.B.A. banquet. I must say that husband of yours is quite the rising star. [laughs]Jean. Oh, and of course you know your neighbor, Jean Bonner. Yes. We met my first day here. You know, my maid Sylvia is dying to get some time with your maid. Aren't you, Sylvia? Well, why don't we go in? [Women chattering, laughing] Oh, now, that lamp is just gorgeous. You know, I was here once for a mixer when those Rothbergs were still here. Now, this is much more sophisticated. [laughs] Why don't we all sit down? Now, first we'll hear from the refreshment and then the decorating chairladies. [Women laughing] Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! [laughing continues] [uproarious laughter] Were any of you treated to the sight of Chas's back this summer at the club? I have half a mind to have him sheared. I mean, the man is a savage. James says that he was named the top young tax attorney in the country. That hardly qualifies him as a s-s-savage. Wrong, Binky. That's exactly what qualifies him. Hmph! [Woman chuckles] [polite chuckle] [polite chuckles] Oh, goodness, Mabel. I've had the most delightful time this afternoon, but I'm afraid I have so many errands to run before it's time to pick up the children. Oh. My Doris gets this rag. [thinking] Tom told me to cancel that damn subscription when we moved in, but no. Oh! [laughing] Is that a bathing suit or a potholder? [Women laughing] Who knows where they'd be if they didn't spend their money on such trash? [Mabel thinking] No. No, don't look at the address. Don't look at the address! 75 cents won't break them, and God knows [whispering] they work hard enough for it, right? Oh, aren't we the admirable little liberal? [sighs] Tight ass.

I forgot that you all were too little to remember the last time we saw my people. [Tom] Please, God, let's not stay too long. We still have to check into our motel, okay? [laughter, chatter] Girl, how many bedrooms y'all got? I forgot.[sighs] I told you, Mama. It's five. Lord have us mercy. Redd Foxx also got five bedrooms. Read it in the Jet last month.

Sweet Jesus, keep me near the cross. Whoo-hoo! Mabel Agnes, girl! Mabel Agnes! [laughing] Whoo-hoo-hoo! A sight for sore eyes. Who is this fool? Did you hear? The lord a-blessed me good, Mabel. Mm-hmm. So I intend to give back to the motherland. I'm gonna buy an airplane to fly folks back to Africa cheap. Mm-hmm. And we're gonna have our own control tower, too, 'cause the Lord knows the man would let a whole planeload of coloreds crash right in the ocean, huh?

Would you stop?Glamour girl. Mom! Both of you stop. Fix the table, go upstairs and wash up. And I mean now.[sighs] [Mabel] I saw that. Rosie, give the bird another 20 minutes, and don't forget to put butter on the green beans. I gotta call Mr. Spader and make sure he's not gonna be late for supper. Straight away, ma'am. Dear Lord, bless this food which we are about to receive this Thanksgiving Day for the nourishment of our body and our souls. Amen. Amen.Amen. Amen. Mmm. You know, on this day of giving thanks, as I look around my table, you know what I see? What, turkey? [chuckles] Stormy. As I look around this table, I see promise, I see unlimited horizons, I see Princeton. Well, I'm gonna study a year abroad in Spain. Spain? That's very far away, isn't it, dear? Well, that's the most sense that girl has spoken in a while. Paris, Spain, Moscow. That's where all these little white kids will be studying. Race, race, race. Can we get through one meal without you obsessing on it? All that nasty stuff just doesn't matter like it did back in your olden times. It's Thanksgiving, everyone. Though I did not appreciate the tone, young lady, I think we were actually making the same point. Opportunity, promise. Those are the watchwords of the day. Too many of our people are stuck in the olden times, convinced that the master's shackles are still around their necks. That's why I'm talking about Princeton. We don't have to just settle for Negro colleges like Morehouse or Howard. The sky is the limit.[Mabel]Tom! [bell ringing] [laughing] Fuck. Oreo boojy motherfucker. [laughing] Fuck you. I got boojy for your ass. [bell ringing] I'll give you five extra minutes, but if you'd done the reading, this shouldn't have been a hassle.

Oh!Hmm? Can I try?Oh, yeah. I saw one of these on Dallas. Well, hit it on the right-hand side. This right here?No, top. Top. Okay, baby, come. Let's do it together. Right here. I'm gonna push it. [gasps] Look at that! I tell you, there's nothing better than when they go down for a nap. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Tina, I'm so glad you're here. Mmm. You know, we cannot let this amount of time go by ever again. I mean, it's simply criminal. [chuckles] I miss you, too. The streets just ain't the same without you. What do you call this cheese again? It's called Brie. It's spelled Bry, but I don't know why. Anyway, it's fabulous, because all you have to do is put it into the microwave for about 30 seconds, and it comes out soft like butter. We don't have a microwave. Well, you don't have to have a microwave. I mean, it's-- I don't see what the big deal is. I'm just saying that you-- Rosie, can we get those steaks, please? [whispering] Come here. How much do you have to pay to have a maid like that? Child, you don't even wanna know. Hmm. More Brie? Bry. [laughing] You don't know how much I've missed the taste of meat. Whenever I'm in the car without Ray, I swear to God, I slow to a crawl in front of every McDonald's. Get outta here.Yeah. Swear to God. Let me tell you how happy I am to be with someone who really appreciates good food. Mmm.Because every time I go to lunch with these ladies, they order cottage cheese and Tab. No! Yes. Well, that must be why them white women always going around with their nose so squinched up. Trying to block them good food odors from reminding them what they're missing. That must be the reason. That must be the truth. [laughing] And what is this craziness with Ray? Telling people that the Ethiopians found a time warp or something? Craziness? Well, yeah. When you... No-- Remember when you called me, and... I said he was trying to educate his coworkers to the amazing achievement of the African-- things the white powers that be hid from us for centuries-- when his nasty Irish boss, in front of everybody, told him to shut the fuck up. What? That's-- You know that's what I'm talking about. Because you just don't know how these white people are going to respond to anything. I'm telling you, you know, I-- I think Ray was crazy-- you know, crazy in those quotation marks-- to-- to even broach the subject with him. That's my Ray. Say good-bye. Say good-bye-bye. She's gonna fall asleep any second now. It was so good to see you.It was great to see you. Hey, wait up, faggot!Whoa! Sorry, Mrs. Spader. Tommy-Two? Hey, Mrs. Johnson.Hi. Getting even better-looking than your daddy. [chuckles] [vehicle approaching] Hi, Mrs. Johnson. it shouldn't take us this long to get together again. It just doesn't make any sense. No, no sense at all. And like you said, it's not, uh, far to come at all. No, it's not that far. So I'll call you next week?We'll talk next week then. All right.All right. [phone ringing] Hello. [Becka] You-hoo! [laughs] It's me. Hi, Becka. How was your weekend? Oh! Oh, it was glorious. [inhales deeply] Oh, where should I start? Well, of course, Chas was away at the Mayo Clinic getting his spastic colon checked on, but still, I was so nervous. I had to take a Fiorinal just to get on the train. [laughing] And then... Felipe met me in the city in the most unseemly neighborhood, and the first thing we had to do was go shopping [laughing] for undergarments for me! You know, the kind without any crotch. I was so excited. I said, "Well, you have to let me tell Mabel, 'cause she's"... [continues rambling] I bought red ones, and pink ones, and blue ones, and yellow ones, and black ones. Oh, they were so pretty! And I bought you a present. You are gonna be so surprised. But I'm not gonna tell you what color. [laughing] You have to wait to see. You are going to just love them. So, I told Felipe about my fantasy. You know-- You know, the one where I sashay into a smoky nightclub, and then... [inhales deeply] a dark man starts licking my armpits. Oh! [laughs] And then, when we got back to the hotel, Felipe surprised me with a squeeze bottle of Okay Margarine. Oh-kay! [laughing] [thinking] That reminds me. It's time for an oil change. Oh-- Oh-- Oh-- Oh-- Uh, listen, Mabel. Now, I shouldn't even be mentioning this... [vacuum whirring] [whirring continues] Okay, I'm in the closet. Can you still hear me? Yes, Becka, I can still hear you. Ohhh! Mabel, listen. Tom's gonna be named to the superior court. What? You know-- You know how Chas's roommate at Andover is the lieutenant governor? And he says it is a done deal. Oh. That's, uh-- That's-- That's wonderful news, Becka. We are never gonna have to pay for another parking ticket again! [laughing][fake chuckling] Chas says we can throw a party for Tom. And you know what? Ah, don't you worry, 'cause I'm gonna make it the event of the season. [chattering] And I said, "I'll take you up on that doubles match if we can go head-to-head on the back nine." Pow! [thinking] This is like some kind of weird movie where they passed out scripts to everybody but me. They probably decided to do that at some buck-naked PTA meeting that I was not invited to. [laughing] Ooh, buck-naked! [Woman, Tom chuckling] Oh! Oh. Excuse me.Yeah. So your father tells me you're thinking about Princeton. We're Class of '67. Students come there from every walk of life. You know, black, white, green. Doesn't matter. Why, just last year, the student body vice president was a man named, um, Leon Robinson. He looked like a young Sidney Poitier. I love his movies. Have you seen his movies? Congratulations, dear.Yes. Lovely party. Thank you. Ooh! [squeals] There you are. I've got someone that I want to introduce you to. The best caterer in all of Fairfield County, Mr. Felipe Herrera. [thinking] Okay. Excuse me. [chattering continues] [sighs] All right. You can think about it. What? I... Yeah, I want to. It's true, although I'm kind of late. Yeah, maybe I--You don't want to miss out. We're proud of Tom.Oh, yeah. We're so happy. [Tom] Oh, here she is, Rob, the belle of my ball. [laughs] Mabel, my love, I would like to introduce you to the next governor of the state of Connecticut.Oh, shh. He's frightfully superstitious.Shh. I swear, if a black cat were to infiltrate your party, he'd leap out the window. [chuckling]As always, my wife is absolutely correct. [chuckles] Rob McInerney. Mrs. Spader, I'd heard that you were ravishing, but I was completely unprepared. Well, I'd heard you were a big old liar, and I was completely unprepared. Hang on to this one, Tom. She's a keeper. Superior court's just the beginning. Everybody says that Chas's buddy, the lieutenant governor, is a shoo-in for the top spot the next time. So he'll be the one, two years from now, who will be nominating me for the Supremes. [chuckling] The supreme court. You get it? [chuckles][chuckles] Yeah. We on our way up, baby. On our way.

That's why I'm calling. She won the second largest jackpot in the history of the Florida State Lottery. And of all the streets in the entire United States, she chooses to live on ours. It's wonderful. I was just about to take a bottle of wine over to her. How much did she win? Mabel! Darling--What? Let me try to be as clear as I can. They'll assume that we invited her. Well, that's just utterly ridiculous. I mean, just because we're the same color, Tom, doesn't automatically mean that we have to know her. I mean, people won't make that kind of assumption. That-- That just doesn't make sense. Listen to me. I work inside the machine. And I'm telling you, we're so close now. The last thing we need is for people to think that we were the beachhead for this-- this ghetto invasion. But, Tom, she could be a perfectly nice woman. Whatever you do, don't go over there.

Two different colors. You got some nice shit in here. The mirror and the thing that match-- that is fabulous. Thank you. The two chairs all up the front. This is beautiful.

I've been fighting these thighs my natural life. [both chuckle] Well, look, I just spoke with the fire inspector. Now, he said it was some sort of initiation. These little white boys trying to act ghetto. [chuckles] Please. You and I know that's a big lie. [thinking] Look, if you're gonna say it, just say it. Let's get it out in the open. I is from the deep South. I know how they do. But I'm almost glad about it, really. Mm-hmm. I was almost starting to think here up north they're gonna act different. No, baby. These uppity white folk-- they did me a favor. Now, like my granddaddy used to say, it's better to set your alarm off in the morning than in the afternoon. I don't know what the hell it mean. He was a drinker, girl. [chuckles] Well, anyway, now, I know I ain't been the friendliest of neighbors, but I was wondering if y'all could use some of this stuff. Now, this is real good when you run out of bleach to clean your toilets. I thought you were a millionaire. I am, and I intend on staying one. See, plenty of colored folks hit the number but die in the poorhouse. That ain't gonna be me. No, it's not. You know, I-- I used to love how that made my sheets smell. I can't remember why I stopped using it. Go on, girl. Get yourself a whiff. It's like old times. [laughs] Well, as long as I got you here... Mmm. And this rat's nest-- this is the reason why I didn't even try to find a Baptist church yesterday. Now, where in the hell can a speck get her hair pressed around here? A speck can't get her hair pressed around here. We have to go all the way to Bridgeport. But you know what? I found a marvelous girl. I'll give you her phone number. Oh, well, I appreciate that, Mrs. Spader. Now, look, I'm gonna get outta here. I'm gonna leave this order form with you. Oh.Just fill it out. Take your time. No pressure at all. All right.All right, girl. You know, this has really been nice having you here, Ruth. I was just about to say the same thing, Mabel.Mmm. Mm-hmm.You know, I got a Aunt Sissy Ruth. She makes the best neck bones you ever tasted. Ooh, I have not had good neck bones since I moved up here. Well, then, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get the recipe. I'm gonna hold you to it.All right. All right now. Um, I'm just about to make some coffee. You want to join me? That's mighty nice of you. Sure. [Tom] Hey, baby.Yeah? [Tom] Who was that? Go on back to sleep, Tom. I'll bring up your lunch later. I tell you, she made the best neck bones. Mm-hmm. The kind that you suck all the meat out of? All the meat, all the marrow--And the juices running down your arm? Listen, you suck that neck bone so bad, its mama starts to cry.Oh, stop it. You know what I mean?Yeah. [conversation continues]
