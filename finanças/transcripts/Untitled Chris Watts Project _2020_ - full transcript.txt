..Tonight. I'm theresa marchetta. -And I'm tom mustin. The disappearance of a pregnant frederick woman and her two children has captured the nation's attention. Shan'ann watts and her two young daughters haven't been seen in the last two days. We have live team coverage of this case. Jaclyn allen is in the neighborhood where there is an active investigation underway right now. -they seemed like a normal family.. -Listening to them as they ask neighbors "have you seen this woman? Do you know this woman?" this is a very visible effort.. ..Bring in denver 7 investigative reporter jace larson who's learning from top sources more about this investigation and the husband's involvement. So, one thing that I just wanted to say is you.. You have to set an example for your kids. You have to set an example. Thank you for your help, honey. Um, but you can't just preach at your kids, you have to live it. To live it. -That's right, you have to live it. So take that leap of faith in yourself and just.. Take that leap of health. -that leap of health and just know that whatever it is in your life that you want.. Whatever it is in your life you want. -If you just take that leap of faith in yourself, you can have it. You can. -That's right. Wherever she is, I hope she's safe. And with the kids, but, like, I don't, like, could she have taken off? I don't know. But if someone has her and she's not safe, like, I want them back. Like, that's where my head's at. Like, if they're safe right now, like, they're gonna come back. But if they're not safe, like, that's the not knowing part, like, if they're not safe, like.. chris, this is tammy lee, she'll be giving you a polygraph today. -Chris, good to meet you. -Thanks. Likewise. - So, I think this is the best way forward and when you're done here we'll figure out next steps. -Okay, sounds like a plan. -Alright. -Have a seat. so I just want you to feel confident that if you had nothing to do with your wife's disappearance, I will find that out today. The only way you can fail the test is if you don't listen to my directions or you choose to lie to me. Understand? Yeah, I've never had a lie detector done on me before. Most people haven't. It's not a normal thing that people go through. -Yeah, no, I just have no idea what to expect. That's normal. Just so you know, we do this in all our missing person cases, so don't think we're just singling you out. We always start from the inside and work our way out. We can tell the investigators, you know, hey, we've cleared chris. He's good to go, you don't have to worry about him. Okay.. Okay. Obviously, if you had something to do with your wife's disappearance, then it would be very stupid to come in and take a polygraph today, so.. Exactly. Of course. Let's just start at the beginning, just treat me like someone who doesn't know anything and catch me up on your life with shan'ann. Chris... Hey, chris! Come here, I have to tell you something! "oops, we did it again" I like that shirt! Wait.. Really? -Really. God, really? - Really. - It's pink. Does that mean it's gonna be a girl? -We don't know, that's just what the test says. I know, I know. God! This is awesome! Baby.. -Really? That is.. I guess when you want it to, it just happens. Come here... watts.. -Hey, man. What's the damage here? Monitor's shot. Run it by the office if you get a chance. Nikki will take care of it. Hey.. You missing something, man? Nope. You sure? my god. You saved my butt. That's what I'm here for. I gotta get this thing resized. It keeps slipping off. How far you down now? Thirty pounds. No kidding. That's strive. I keep telling you, man, strive works. Like, that's the metaburn.. I feel more focused, I have more energy, like, the pounds keep flying off. My wife will get you on the program. Seriously, all you have to do is say the word. Yeah, right. There's a convention this weekend at the doubletree. You should stop by. I'm thinking about sleeping this weekend, man. Hey, tell shan congrats on the new kiddo. Take her out.. On me. Gift cards. Yeah. Thanks, man. I'm really hoping for a boy. -Either way, you're outnumbered. Three is more than a few. It's lots... Like, many. So I've been with strive since January and, um, I've already earned two free trips. Chris and I are gonna go to cancun next year. Um, I'm loving my job. I get to travel and I'm helping people to live healthier, happier lives, including myself, and I feel so blessed. So what I want to say this morning is, like, does your job allow you to live your best life? Because you deserve that. Everybody does. Just be happy. Um, period. End of story. and I'm gonna be at the doubletree this- I'm coming! Come and say hi, 'cause I'm gonna be giving out free strive starter kits to the first 50 strivers who come. And next week I'm gonna be in north carolina gettin' my strive on, so come and say hi. Have a good day.. Bye! Hello. -Hello. What are you thinking? -Three is good! I'm excited! -Congratulations. -It's gonna be great. Come in. -Is it just me, or is chris looking really good these days? I know, right? He feels so good too, and he's been working out every day and he suddenly has a six-pack. He's strivin'. I have to show you this. Look.. This is an app that keeps track of all your credit card charges in case your purse gets stolen. Or your husband buys something he shouldn't. It's just easier if I can keep track of everything. I'm just sayin'. How long are you going to north carolina? -Six weeks. It'll be good because my parents are there and the in-laws are there. They'll all help take care of the kids while I do conference follow-ups, sign with the clients, I might even be able to relax a little bit. I mean, not as much as chris, but some. He's not going? -He'll be there in a couple of weeks. He has to work. He's gonna get so bored in this house all by himself. Poor thing. I need to make a father's day video for chris. Will you just press the red button for me? Thanks. Go. Hi chris. I just wanted to say that we are so blessed to have you in our lives and you do so much for us and you take such good care of us, um, and you're the reason that I was brave enough to agree to #3. So, you're incredible and we're really lucky to have you in our lives. Happy father's day.. you look so sexy. -Really? Thanks. Water.. Water toast? To a boy? -A boy. have you thought about names? Christopher watts ii. You don't love it. Okay, um.. Maybe we could name him after my dad. Edward? -Eddie. Eddie? I want him to have friends. I want him to be liked. I was thinking about, um.. Nico. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's awesome. I love it. -Really? -Nico christopher watts. Nico lee watts? Well... Are you ready to order? Um.. I'm gonna have- Do you have any kind of like grilled chicken something? -We have grilled chicken salad. Let's have two of those. We'll have two. Thank you. Judith! Hi kevin, hi judith. -Hey shan'ann! They're so fun. Let's get out of here. Yeah, baby? Where's my helicopter? You know what? Let me help you. we do not want to miss this flight. Hop in. -Alright. Great job, everybody. And there we go. Okay. Okay, you girls remember the rules? Yes. No fighting and listen to mommy. That's right. Pretty good. Love you. I'm gonna miss you. You'll call me, right? Yeah, of course. -Okay, love you! Love you too. Be good, girls. bye, daddy. We love you. See you soon. -Travel safe. See you in a few weeks. well, it sounds like you two were very happy. We were, yeah. And then we weren't. I mean, last time I spoke with shan she wanted to separate. Tell me about that. Um, you and shan'ann have good jobs, a nice house, the girls are adorable, there's a baby on the way.. So, what am I missing? Pfft, I-I.. You'd have to ask her. hey, jim. safety office. Please hold. Hey. Hi. What can I do for you? I'm easy. Good, 'cause if one more person asks me about a replacement safety valve I might not come back from lunch. I'm serious. I'm just gonna get in my car and just drive. Well.. And that's the sixth one today. But I like you.. So... Glad you like me. Don't let it get to your head. Too late. If you have any problems, give me a call. Thanks. You're quitting. What? -Good for you. No. I don't smoke. I.. It's.. Strive. Is that like a religious thing? No, it's like, I don't know.. Vitamins and minerals. Helps your body get, like, fit, you know? You look alright. Just alright? You look good. Call me if you have any problems. Or even if you don't. hey, nikki. It's chris, chris.. Chris watts, the guy you said you liked? yeah? Hey, um.. Well, it worked just fine. Thanks. Sometimes I just want to get in my car and say to hell with it and drive away and never look back. -And go where? I don't know. Figure it out when I get there. How about you? Where would you rather be? You kidding? Right here, right now. No place I'd rather be. the girls would love this place. Girls? Daughters. Um, bella and cece. You're a dad? Yeah,..Here. That's bella. -Cute. Cece's on the right. And you're married. Why don't you wear a ring? We're separated. We live in the same house but, like, I sleep in the basement, like, just trying to sell the home, you know, keep things cool for the kids, so.. Hey. Would I lie to you? would I lie to you? What time am I picking you up on Friday? -Friday's my birthday! You got plans? Guess I do now. Something was definitely up with shan when she went to north carolina. I could feel it. Was she worried that you were apart for so long? Do you think she could have thought you were maybe having an- no. No, that's not me. I'm not the kind of guy that's like, you know, my wife is out of town, let me see what other girl I can find. Like, I'm not like that. I respect my wife, she respects me. There's nothing that she could hold back. Like, I am not the kind of guy that just sort of goes off and will sleep with anyone. No, like, people know me. That is not who I am. how are you? Yay! Yahoo! Coming to you live from north carolina! Hi casey, hi laura. So I just wanted to talk a little bit today about mindfulness and I wanted to say that I'm really grateful for my health. A lot of you know this but ten years ago my hair started falling out and I was getting tired all the time and eventually I was diagnosed with lupus. Um, I thought my life was over, then I discovered strive and I.. I got my happy back. Also my husband chris. I am so grateful for you, chris. You are the best and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. hey, boo. -Hey, chris, how are you? Hanging in there. How are the girls? -They're great. They're having so much fun. Lots of dance parties, lots of hide n' seek. Are they still up? Can I talk to them? -Hi daddy! Hey, munchkins. You guys being good? -I guess. Hey, it's your bedtime, isn't it? Why don't you guys sleep tight, do what your mom says and don't let the bedbugs bite, ok? -Night night, daddy. So tell me something good. How is work? Boo, I'm out with the guys right now. I gotta run. I can't talk. -Well, I love you. I love you too. -I'll talk to you so- chris? Wow. Wow.. Hi. -Hi. happy birthday. You didn't have to do that. "nikki, your energy is insane. You heat me up, you make me melt, and then you cool me down like rain. Happy birthday". That may be the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me... ..And he listens. That's really sweet. Thanks. You're welcome. Do you feel that? Come here. Where are we going? no, I did not. Thank you. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll be right back. You got .... All in your teeth right here. Get out. Don't move. My snack for later. so things weren't great between you two? You know that spark, it just.. I kept hoping it would kind of fix itself but, um.. You know, it just wasn't the same. Now where's my lady? Come here, little cece. Okay, look. Daddy's on camera right there. Say "hi daddy". -Hi daddy. Say "I miss you and I love you". -I love you, daddy. I miss you. -Good job, girl. Okay. yay! Mom, say hi. Good job. And we're gonna blow a kiss. Ready? One, two, three.. hi chris. Say hi. Say "hi daddy, I love you". I miss you, daddy. Bye, daddy. Okay, bye. I love you. Bali has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. What about cuba? For the beaches? The cars. -I knew it. You like cars? Wildflowers. Wildflowers? -Yeah. They don't need anything from anyone, they grow wherever they want.. Beautiful and free. that's awesome. Hey, is there anything in that book that's nearby, like, in colorado or something? White sands. - Pfft. Everybody's been to white sands. You haven't been to white sands. Wait... You've lived here 27 years and you've never been to white sands? Are you judging me? Yes, I'm judging you! Why don't we get some time off work and we're gonna go? Have you done this before? What? This. Never. What's different? You're different. hey, eddie. -Hey, there's my daughter in law. -Good to see you. I got something to show you. - Great. aww, is this for the girls? For the boy. Wait, we don't know if it's a boy yet. It's time for a boy to carry on the watts family name. Here. Chris used to love this. Thank you, that's cute. Thanks. Where are the girls? Swing set. Hey, girls! Grampy's here! -Grampy! So how did you keep yourself busy while they were away? I was just being here. Just working out, going to work, you know, going on runs and keeping up the house. stop. Who keeps calling? Shan'ann. Come on. Let me see that one where you turn around. This one? No, what is that? That's not a pose. -Okay, you should take it. She's ruining the mood. Go. Yeah. go. Don't move. Where am I gonna go? hey! -Okay, hi. Just hear me out. I've thought about this a lot and I don't want the girls staying at your parent's house while we're on this trip. yeah, so, what do you.. What do you want me to do about it? -I want you to call your dad right now and tell him we're not going. Okay? Hello? Chris! Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah. I will. -You're gonna call him tonight? Yeah. -Okay, thank you. That's all I ask, just.. I'm sorry. Honey, I don't feel good. I'm so tired and, um.. Are you okay? Yeah. -It doesn't really seem like you want to be talking to me. No, just.. I have long days at work, you know? I'm worn out. Okay. Get some rest. Don't forget to eat dinner. By the way. I got an alert from visa that there's a charge at a place called the wheelhouse? That was me, yeah, why? I don't want to nag you, but, um, that's the card we're trying to pay down, right? Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry, I was out with the guys and I forgot. Hey, you tell the girls I love them and, um, give them a big ol' kiss for me, will ya? -Okay. I love you. I'll t- chris? thank you. What's that? Company gift card. They give me so many I might as well use 'em. That's nice. I'm gonna run upstairs real quick and grab some clothes. Be back down in a sec. -you okay? Yeah, it's just you have this great house and this perfect family. I don't know why you wouldn't want to try to work things out with your wife. -I did. We both did. It's just.. We're two different people. Then.. Why aren't you divorced yet? -Because, I mean.. It's expensive, first of all. We're still trying to figure out what we want to do with the house. It's just.. It's a lot. Well, it's super neat. It's like no one lives here. -That's shan'ann. It's her jam all day. Okay. Kids are cute. That's shan'ann too. Thank god. No, the oldest. What's her name? Bella. She looks like you. Yup. She's like your little mini me. What are you getting at? Nothing. Just.. Divorce isn't easy, so... No, yeah. It's, Nope. So...? So I don't want to be responsible for destroying a family. Nikki, no, no. There's nothing to destroy. Just take me home, chris. It's over. Nikki.. Take me home. Nikki, hey, look.. Nikki? Hey, look, this is.. -he's probably just trying to adjust. You know how men are. They panic at the word "baby". Yeah.. I don't know. He seemed so happy before we left. -I'm sure he was. Honey, he just needs to wrap his brain around it. Listen, when he gets there, things will go back to normal. It's just the way marriage works. Ups and downs and that's just part of the game. Yeah, you're probably right. nikki.. Look, I got you some time off this weekend. For what? Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Woo! Where are we camping? I'll take you to the site. wooo hooo! I didn't realize how badly I needed this. We both did. Sometimes you just gotta get away, you know? Nikki.. Yeah? I love you. Do you mean that? I mean that. I love you. I love you too. -You didn't text me back! I thought something happened to you! Sorry. I'll make it up to you next time I see you. I love you, boo. You know that. -Right. I'm trying to give you your space but I'm carrying our third child and I'm fighting with two little kids all day and I'm trying to make money. You need to talk to me. What is going on? Nothing. Like.. Nothing. I'll make it up to you and the girls next time I see you. You know what? No. I'm tired of begging for you to talk to me. I'll just.. I'll see you on Tuesday. Have a good flight. Boo! hi. Hi. Thanks for taking me out here. Thanks for coming. I really.. Really.. Could she have been seeing someone else? Is that possible? I don't know. But if she is, like, I don't care, like, I wouldn't wonder who that could be. But, you know, I'm fine. Just come back and we'll talk about it later. -Were you guys having sex at all? -No. When I got to north carolina it just didn't feel the same. -Okay go.. Go get him! Go get him! Daddy, daddy! -Munchkins! Hey! Mwah! Mwah! Did you guys miss me? -Yes, we missed you! -cool.. Hi. Whatchu doing? What are you doing biting on me? I gotcha! I got you. Where's the other one? I gotcha.. Grrrr! - It's a monster! -Just leave them alone. Just let them be. Mom, no. They're gonna get a sunburn. -No, they won't. They'll be fine. There's shade all over the place. There's not shade. It's sunny. Mom, we have to get the girls ready. -Relax, honey, they'll be fine. It's a two and a half hour drive to myrtle beach. -There is plenty of time. -We have to check in at the hotel by 3:00 pm. -So what... I want it! Give it back. hey, daddy. I have a song for you. My daddy is a hero, he helps me grow up strong. He reads me books, he ties my shoes, you're a hero through and through. Daddy, I love you! Here we are in north carolina. It's the girls' first time at the beach. They're loving it! They're having the best time. Okay, so get to the booth early 'cause these strive starter packs go fast. Bye! Thank you! hey.. Hey, can we talk? Are you mad at me 'cause I didn't let the kids stay at your parent's house? Things are just a little off with us right now. But it's fine. It's whatever. -That's all? Yeah, that's it. It's fine. No.. No, that's not all. What's... Girls, stay close, please. What's happening? I feel like.. Have you been happier alone or something? No, no, you know I love you and the girls. Chris, the past five weeks have been awful for me. I just miss you. I miss.. You know, smelling you in the sheets and talking to you and seeing you with the girls and I just.. I.. Flat out miss you. Now you're here and it's like you're not there. What's going on? You haven't asked me about the baby. And you're not talking about the girls. I'm just, I'm worried. And I'm.. I'm spotting. These first 12 weeks, they're scary and I just- do you want this baby? I mean... My god. What's happening? You're the one that wanted to try for a third! What is happening? I liked our family the way it was, okay? And now we're having three. It's, like, a lot of responsibility. Alright? If you're done I need to know right now. I'm not done. I need to know right now. Tell me right now. I just don't know where my head is at. I love you, I love the kids. I just... Need some time. Yeah. Guys, let's get to the car. Come on. will you hold me? Please? I'm gonna fix this. Things will get better, I promise. something definitely came to a head in north carolina. It was clear, like, shan did not want to be with me anymore. Do you know if she told anybody that, like her mom or anybody? She said she didn't, but... I wanted to stay married. She was distant and cold. I don't know what I did. Your wife keeps tagging all these photos of you and the girls at the beach. Shan'ann just puts that stuff online for work or whatever. It's like her pr. -Well, you guys seem really happy. "seem". -Are you sure you two aren't trying to work things out? Nikki, it is over. We're done. I love you. -Okay. I'll see you when you're back. hi. I missed you. Shan.. I thought you'd be happy it was a boy. I am happy. You were an hour late! I'm sorry, I just had some things I needed to think about. -What did you need to think about? Look.. We have been married eight years. We have an anniversary coming up, we have two beautiful kids. I don't want to be the guy that just blows all of that up. What do you want?? Start over, shan. Just.. Forget about the last six weeks. Okay? Really? -Yeah, they have not been good. And that is mostly my fault and.. Look, hey, maybe when you're back from this trip we could just do something. You know? Just us, we take a trip. Get amber to babysit the kids or something? Really? Yeah. That'd be perfect. Come here. August 10th, that's when shan'ann flew out with amber. And she was really mad when she left. I don't know why. I didn't even have any time to think about it, you know? I was looking after both the girls. just relax. Take a breath. We're about to get started. Just, lean forward for me a little bit. I need you to put your hands above your head like you're diving into a pool. If these ever feel too tight, just let me know, alright? Now this is a cardio cuff, same kind you'd find in any doctor's office. We find we get a better reading if we put it on the calf. Alright, relax your leg. Try to remain still. And lastly, these are the finger plates. Put your hand there, please, and spread your fingers for me. In layman's terms, these are just gonna monitor your sweat gland activity. Is there anything else you want to share with me before we begin? Nope. Let's.. Let's do it. Alright. The coolest thing about this is that right now there's only one person in this room who knows the truth and in about five minutes there's gonna be two of us. So that's the coolest part. -Are you ready to begin? Yep. Regarding shan'ann's disappearance, do you intend to answer all the questions truthfully? -Yes. -Is your first name christopher? Yes. -Before 2018, did you ever lose your temper with someone you loved? No. Do you know where shan'ann is now? Hi chris, I miss you! No. Did you physically cause shan'ann's disappearance? No. Are you lying about the last time you saw shan'ann? No. -Alright, this portion of the test is finished. You can relax. awesome. How'd I do? good night, amber. -Bye. Unit 18 2825 saratoga trail wellness check in progress. -you must be amber. Yeah, hi. -So what's going on? Um, so my friend shan'ann and I were on a business trip this weekend. I just dropped her off at 2:00 am this morning. -Alright. Um, she's 15 weeks pregnant and, um, well, she felt really bad all weekend, she wasn't eating or drinking normally. So she had a doctor's appointment this morning at 9:00. I asked if she needed me to take her, 'cause she has two little girls, um.. She's very distraught, 'cause, well, she and her husband were having issues, but supposedly they're separating but I didn't know that until I talked to him this morning when I called him because I was, like, have you talked to shan'ann or seen her since she left for work because, um, you know, I can't get a hold of her. I have called, I have texted.. And her car's in the garage. Her shoes that she wears, like, literally every single day are at the front door. Um, I called the doctor's office and, she didn't show up for her appointment. -The husband's on the way? -Yeah, he says he's 45 minutes out but he said that a long time ago. I don't know what's taking so long. -you can't just enter? -No, I need permission from the homeowner. -doesn't change anything that she's pregnant? -No, the grandparents could have taken her and the kids somewhere. Her phone could be dead. If I saw her lying on the ground it'd be different, but I just can't violate the homeowner's rights. Okay. that's him. That's chris, that's chris's truck. -hey. -How are you? -is this the only car she would drive? -Yup. yeah, car seats are here. you mind if I come in, chris? -Sure. -can we take a look upstairs? I just want to make sure she isn't passed out somewhere. Yeah. I found her phone. -Her phone's here? Yeah. Her phone's here. -It was under that pillow there, I think. She doesn't go anywhere without her phone. Do you know her passcode? It used to be 2386 but now it's six digits? The baby's due date. Yup. Um, could she have gone to the pool? To the pool? -There's a little rec centre down there. Do you want me to go check, or..? -Are you going through any marital issues? We're separated. She didn't tell me that. -Have you filed yet? No, we're still figuring out what we're doing with the house. -How's that going so far? Civil? Yeah, well.. Civil. -What's that? Found her wedding ring. Told you she wanted to leave me. -alright, well, maybe we should just head next door then. What for? any motion event that'll happen on this street.. I got it. 5:17.. This is him. Yeah, I'm just loading up my stuff. I got coolers and tools for my toolbox, computer.. You know, lunch box, book bag. Stuff. Yeah, usually I'll park around the side here but there's so much stuff to load up it's just easier to pull up, you know, just back up, so.. -any sign of shan'ann leaving the house? -No. Is there anything you want to do with this, or..? - Well, detective baumhover just showed up so he'll probably want to talk to you and check and see if there's been any suspicious bank activity, or... Yeah. Alright, well, hey, thanks. Yeah, no worries. I have no inclination about where they're at and I've exhausted, like, every friend that I know of, and, like, every friend I have has called friends that shan'ann has that maybe I don't know about. And she's, like.. Well, vanished. She's just.. She just... Like, I came home last night and it was like a ghost town. Like, nobody was home. She wasn't home. The kids weren't home. Like, I have no idea where they went. And it's just like.. It doesn't even feel real right now. You know, this just.. It feels like, you know, a nightmare that I can't wake up from. like, I don't even.. I don't know.. If you have any more, like.. -Your wife shan'ann is 15 weeks pregnant. I know this may be a tough question but did you guys get into an argument before she left or anything? -It wasn't like an argument. We had an emotional conversation. it's not my- -stop lying! Where were you on Monday? There was a leak at the site. -Where are you now? Cece's bed. -Where are the sheets? I had to put them in the wash. They were stinky, so... I gotta go. hey, chris. Um.. I brought graham in here with me because we wanted to talk to you about your test results. Chris, I'm gonna go ahead and sit next to you. Do you mind scooting down? I'm a little claustrophobic. - Yeah. so it was completely clear in the testing that you were not being honest, but you already know that. I did not lie. I, like, I don't know anything other than what I already told you, so, like- it's not even an option because you failed the polygraph, so I know you're being deceptive. And it's normal. People make mistakes. And initially you're gonna go "I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't do anything". It's like if you say to your kids "did you write on the wall?" and they go "no" and you're like, "well, I can see that you have marker on your hands" and they're like "okay". Eventually you're going to tell the truth. And this is your "eventually tell the truth" moment. So.. What happened? I don't know. I don't know where they're at. Like, I want them to come home. But you know they're not coming home. I don't know that. You know they're not. I hope they do come home. Chris, chris, but you're lying about something else here today, and we need to talk about that. I cheated on her. I cheated on her and I'm not proud of that. I, like.. She accused me of it, I denied it. Like, look... She was pregnant. I feel horrible about that but I did not hurt her. I cheated on her, I hurt her emotionally and I feel terrible but, like.. I fell in love with someone else. That is god's honest truth. Chris, in the interview today you weren't asked anything about infidelity, so.. Why do you think you failed the test? In the back of my head I, like, I was holding back. I knew I was holding back. That's why I failed. It's okay, chris. We knew when we first had you in. We knew all about nikki. She called, told us everything. That's why we didn't ask you in the test.. Because we already knew the answer. mr. Watts? I'm tammy. I'm the polygrapher. I just wanted to check on you and see if you needed anything. No.. How's he holding up? Surprisingly well, given the circumstances. Good. I know he just wants to get back out there - we both do - to find shan'ann and the girls. I'll bet. I just can't believe that she'd do this to us, you know? You think she got mad and ran off? you don't know shan'ann. Well, she seems nice enough. Well, everyone "seems" nice. -You know what, chris? You have been in here for hours and you have not shed one tear over your girls, not one. -I don't know what you want me to say? Like, I'm not- don't look into that. It's not like I don't love my kids! -Just explain that to me, okay, because if I lose my kid in the supermarket for a minute I am panicking. I'm, like, I'm also panicked! -Okay, and you're telling me that you're having these emotional conversations with your wife and you haven't cried once.. Not once for your baby girls who are missing. I need to find them, like, those girls are my life! -Then help us find your baby girls. Look at them, chris. -Chris, did shan'ann do something to them? No.. What? -Did shan'ann do something, maybe it was an accident? Something happened in the house and maybe you felt- did she do something to them and then you did something to her? No.. No. -Did you have to cover something up for shan'ann? -No. -Chris, people make mistakes and it's what they do after those mistakes that makes them who they are. So what I think is that maybe shan'ann did something, and I think you're the kind of guy who would feel like they had to cover it up for her. I did not kill my kids. -Tell us. Tell us what happened, chris. Can I just talk to my dad or something? -Of course. He flew all the way across the country, can I just talk to him? -Absolutely. Sure. Chris, your dad is not going to stop loving you no matter what you tell him. You're his son. hello, son. So.. Want to tell me what's going on? I went downstairs and I heard.. She freaked out and I go upstairs and she's choking.. And they were blue.. I freaked out.. And I did the same thing to her.. we know you drove out to the work site early that morning.. So we figure shan'ann and the girls are out there? I don't want to leave 'em there another minute. When was this taken? It's today. Where is shan'ann, chris? cece was just sprawled out and that's when I saw shan on the baby monitor on top of bella.. And I ran in there. -She was on top of her strangling her? Yeah! When I got in there, bella's just not moving.. So I pulled shan'ann off and I just.. I lost it. -After you argued, did you have any inkling that shan'ann would do something like this? No. No.. We loved those girls. Her family members told me that shan was unstable but I didn't think she was capable of anything like this. -Okay, so then what happened? I loaded the bodies into the truck.. And, drove to the work site. I buried shan'ann. -And where are the girls? I wasn't thinking. I took them out, I put each one of them into a tank. -In the tanks? What's in them? -A mixture of oil and water. Remember when you first sat down here I told you I would get to the truth, it's my job? This is the truth. -I think we're close but we're not quite there. I didn't hurt those girls. -They found the bodies. But what happens when it comes back and the evidence is against you? It won't. -You're sure? I'm 100% sure. But chris, shan'ann seemed like a good mom. I'm a pretty good dad. When you saw her choking your babies, did you ever think to call an ambulance? You can imagine we're pretty cynical about these things, right? It really does look like you wanted to have a new life and the only way to get it was to kill the kids before shan'ann got home. If I come into a room and my kid's been decapitated I still call the ambulance. It just doesn't.. It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't add up. So you're either a monster who says I want this hot girlfriend so I'll just kill everybody and hope it turns out.. Or something else. I'm not a monster. mr. Watts, stand up. -what are you thinking now, chris? Can you face the wall here? -That I let everyone down. Arms straight out to the side. -My friends, my family.. Everyone. Face me, please. Arms out. The emerging details in the disappearance of the pregnant colorado mother and her two little girls, investigators now believe they have found the bodies of shan'ann and her children. To the outside world, the watts family seemed perfect. On social media shan'ann watts appeared to have the ideal life, showing photos of family vacations and business trips. My husband, I am so grateful for you, chris. I love you and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. -Just after pleading for their return, her husband chris watts appeared in court reportedly confessing to killing her and disposing of the bodies of all three. Friends say that chris always played the part of loving husband and devoted father. It's hard to make sense of this all, and I think the question on everyone's mind is why. bet you weren't expecting to see us. You look different. Well, they just made me.. Shave it all off these days. Looks good. Thanks. So how you doing? Pretty good. What about you guys? Yeah. So let's just, put some fears aside. I mean, the last time we talked was a different situation but now your case is closed, we're not interested in getting any more charges. Tammy and I have been talking and, um, everyone that we've spoken to says the same thing. They say, "we didn't see it coming". Every single one, and so we thought you might have some things you want to get off your chest.. Some things you might want to talk about. You want the truth. Well, it may bring peace of mind to you and everyone involved. Shan'ann's family especially. I loved shan'ann. Nikki was like a drug. She just.. She made me feel like I couldn't do anything wrong.. Like I mattered, like I was important, you know? She.. Asked my opinion. The whole time shan'ann was in north carolina I was with nikki. The whole time I never slept a single night at home. It's like I had blinders on. So what happened that morning? shan.. Shan! We need to talk. -What? It's the middle of the night, babe. Shan, we need to talk now. Now.. Shan... Now. What are you doing? -That didn't feel right. What? Sex with your wife didn't feel right? What are you talking about? It felt like a test, shan. You're crazy! Get off me, this is gonna hurt the baby. Get off of me. Get off! Get off! Get off of me! say it.. Say it! Say it! Say it. There's someone else. what's her name? Nikki. You know, I knew it. I knew. Last night with the credit card charges, that was you guys, right? You're disgusting! I'm sorry, shan. I don't know what got into me. When did this start? When you went to north carolina. You're pathetic. Well.. You're a pathetic man. Well, shan, I don't know what I want. Well, I do. I want a divorce. Does that make you happy? Does that make it easier for you? Can we be civil? There's nothing civilized about cheating on your wife, you ass....! Who do you think you are? Seriously? No! You don't get to do this to me! You don't get to do this to our girls, to our son.. No. No! You make our lives hell, I'm gonna make your life so much worse. Shan, don't say that. All our friends are gonna know. Shh. Shut up. I'm gonna tell everybody exactly who you are and what you did. I'm gonna tell your parents.. You're gonna have no friends! Between spousal support and child support, you're not gonna have two pennies to rub together! And if you think I'm gonna let our daughters hang out with that whore.. You're crazy! No way! Shan.. This is my house now. I want you out of here, go. No.. Shh. I want you to leave, I want you to leave. Go! -No. Get out! Get out! I want you out! Shan! Shut up! Shhh.. Shhh. I was just angry. I'd been mad since July and it must have had something to do with it. I just.. Felt like this fuse had been burning and it just burned to its end. I couldn't let go. I wanted to, I tried to.. I couldn't. Like somebody had their arms around me, I just, I couldn't.. I woke up that morning, it's like the seed was just planted in me and that was what was gonna happen that day. I didn't have any control over it. I saw my whole life just disappear in front of my eyes and I still couldn't let go. And then she was gone. Where were the girls? no, no, no, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Mommy shh shh. The girls, you mentioned that cece was first. Did you use a blanket to cover her face, or..? There was a blanket, then my hand. Where was bella? -She was in the truck, she didn't know what was going on. She was just sitting there right next to us. -So after cece was gone, you... I took her and I.. I put her in a tank and I went back to the truck and bella asked me, "is the same thing that happened to cece going to happen to me?" I told her yes. Just like a horrible person, I just... I put the blanket over her head.. And I did the same thing to her. She kept saying "daddy, no!" "daddy, no", those were the last words she said. I keep hearing her say that every day. Every day. I loved those girls. They were my life. I'd do anything to take that back. But I can't. I just can't. No, you can't. well, we got the truth. Something's still eating at you, what is it? -No defensive wounds. Shan'ann didn't struggle. She didn't fight him. The entire time she thought he was gonna let go. Right up til the very end. Maybe we do only see what we want to, but.. If that's the case then we never really know anyone. And that's terrifying.
