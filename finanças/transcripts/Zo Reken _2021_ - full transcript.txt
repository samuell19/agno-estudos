Let's get out of the rain and into the zo reken. In Haitian Creole, "zo reken" means "shark bones". The term refers to a local cane alcohol made by soaking shark bones in hard liquor. It is said that the drink increases virility. "Zo reken" is also the nickname given to the 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser, renowned for its power and toughness and very popular with international humanitarian organizations. Agent! I want to talk to you! I want to know something. Can we drive on these streets? You can drive on several streets. They won't be closed today or tomorrow? No, but it's harder in some places. For example? If you're around the area of Champ-de-Mars, people will throw rocks. -They throw rocks at people now? -Yes. Alright. Thanks. Someone was going that way and had to turn around. If you're in a vehicle, they'll throw rocks at you. Everywhere in the neighbourhood, they're throwing rocks? Yes, throwing rocks. When you say over there, where exactly do you mean? Over by Champ-de-Mars and all around there. Okay, I'll be careful. Take care. You too. Welcome to today's newscast. Unrest still grips the capital and many nearby regions due to the protests that have been dubbed "peyi lok". They were started by the opposition in an attempt to force President Jovenel Moïse to step down. Traffic is at a standstill, shops and banks are closed and the schools have been shut down. Explosions were heard this morning in the districts of Delmas, Canapé-Vert and Juvenat where the regime's opponents claim they were defending their barricades. Last night in Delmas, the police were forced to use tear gas and to fire shots in order to clear the streets, but early this morning, the protesters had moved all kinds of objects into the streets and are continuing to block traffic. I've been coming to the market for two months and the country is locked down. Everything is at a standstill, nothing is running! Jovenel has locked down the country. We can't even live, we can't do anything! We need freedom in order to function. The schools are shuttered, the kids can't go to school. We've paid our school fees, the schools won't reimburse them. Our kids have to go back to school. The country has to go back to normal. We've had enough! We can't sell anything in the daytime. They launch tear gas onto our things. They throw bottles. We're hungry! The only solution is for Jovenel to leave. Give us our country back! The kids have to go to school. Just think, we're at the end of a semester. He has to go! Rice is too expensive. Corn sells for $70 a pot! Black beans are $125, or $25 for a small pot. We can't even eat that. Jovenel has to go! No further! Blocked, blocked! It's blocked further along. -Completely blocked? -With a mound of gravel. And is it blocked again further down? -Do you know? -Further down? How long has it been blocked? Since yesterday. No one's been through since yesterday? No, and today they made the barrier bigger. They added to it? -There are at least three piles now. -Thanks. Sorry, can you help me? I'm looking for the Espoir Hospital. -The Espoir Hospital? -Yeah, where is it? Further along. I'm going there too. I can show you the way if you give me a ride. -That way? -Yeah, I'm going there too. -Over there? -Yeah. Can I come with you and show you? Okay, get in. That would be a great help. -Thanks. -How you doing? -Straight ahead? -Yeah. -And you, how are you doing? -Just fine. What are you doing in this area? I have a meeting with someone at Espoir Hospital. It's lucky that I came across you. I have a meeting to give them my resumé. I'm looking for a job. -You're looking for work? -Yeah. That's a problem in the country, no? Yeah, it's a problem. It's so hard. -Don't turn there. -Okay. Turn here, because there might be barricades. Over there? -I should turn left? -Yes. There are so many barricades that it's a real muddle to get there. They're all over the place. I came from Pétion-Ville and I had to get off a motorcycle-taxi and take another one. I had to cross over the barricades on foot. That's what I did. I think there are barricades over there. Is that a barricade there? So you've been looking for work for a while? Yes, it's been a long time. And what made it harder is that the government needed to send me my papers, but I didn't get them in time. So I had some interesting proposals, but because I didn't have my papers in order, I couldn't move forward. Are they throwing rocks at us? Yes, they are. Things are out of control here these days! It's out of control. Hello? Listen. Do you have any information about which way to go to get out of here? Because at this point... Yesterday there were protests, today there are barricades. Barricades on all sides! Some barricades are guarded, but at others, no one's there. Some are burning, others not. Can you find out for me, so I know which way to go? Alright. Okay. Talk to you later. Bye. Do you know how long we'll be stuck here for? We might be here for a while. I don't know. We're stuck. You know the situation. Everything changes from one moment to the next. My meeting will fall through because we can't get there. This country is full of problems. -Right or left? -Left? Right or left? I think we go right. You can cross, ma'am. What do I look like in this vehicle? When they look at me, they say, "Damn that traitor". That's for sure. Since we started out, people have been looking at us, and they're thinking, "What are they playing at?" Do I go up? To the right. It's funny, I thought we'd be less visible in a vehicle, but that's not really the case. This van, to begin with, is a model that draws attention for all the wrong reasons. It's the vehicle used for repression. It's used by the police. This vehicle means either NGO or repression. It means power, in any case. The only good thing is that drivers seem to be well paid. Better paid than most Haitians, in any case. It's true. They're paying them to keep their mouths shut. Yeah. -They're well-paid and tight-lipped! -Yeah. Left here. Is there a point, - I'm now talking to the silent driver - when you've had enough of working for all these assholes who show up and who make so much more money than you? These rich assholes who pretend that they love the country, take a couple drives, write a couple cheques, and they're gone. That's to you. The question is for you. I just drive, I focus on the road. There you go. That's a stereotypical driver's answer! What's fascinating, if you're aware of it, if you're somewhat intelligent and have a bit of curiosity, is to see how there are those who drive and others who watch them. Oh yes. People who stop to look, people who turn around, they see these cars pass and they say, "They aren't one of us." Is there anything positive about the huge foreign presence in this country? What good can come of it today for the Haitian people? What do we do with all these Whites fucking over the country? Seriously, they're not helping. They're here, they talk shit all the time, and the country sinks deeper into the shitpile. Do you see the boat? Looks like it's going to another country. It's leaving Haiti. I see someone over there. -Is that the edge of Haiti? -No, Haiti keeps going that way. That's foreign territory. Straight that way, where you see the boat. -No. -That's Miami. You're nuts. You're even more nuts because that's Cuba. -Let me see. -That's where Cuba is on the map. I'm talking about this way. Over past the mountain. That's Cuba? -No, Saint-Domingue. -Saint-Domingue is back behind us. There's a thing called a shark, my brother. Who would it most like to eat? Mario, because of his light skin. This is a real oasis compared to what you see out there. But it's also a bit of a gilded cage. We are easily locked in. It's been almost four weeks since I've been outside because of "peyi lok". Once you're out, everything changes. Once you're out, it's more working-class. It's really different. You can feel the tension in the neighbourhood. Yes, there's tension. When someone looks over, it's not... There is tension. At the end, we turn right. There's not a single tap-tap (taxi bus). I think there's a problem up ahead. Yeah, we can't go any further. I see the police. That car up ahead is turning around. Try to go and see. But I think we'll have to turn around. There's a protest going on. Yeah. That's no good. That means the country is still under lockdown. It's definitely not over yet. One tap-tap. Two tap-taps. That's it. Small groups tend to gobble up all the wealth. When one person's driving around in a car worth $60,000 and another person doesn't even have 50 cents to get something to eat, the poor guy ends up wanting to break the rich guy's windshield. It is this inequality in Haitian society that has led to the current situation. I don't think you can get any further. -What? -You can't go further. -I can't hear you. -You can't get through here. Right. I'm not going that way. If we turn to the Bible, to the Old Testament, God always called out to Man, and when the Children of Israel were struggling, he sent prophets to lament for them. At one point, there was a drought, people were dying, and prophets like Eli beseeched on their behalf for the rain to fall. As for the situation that we're in, as Christians, the first thing we must do is pray for God to intervene on Haiti's behalf. Because God... Prayer will get us out of this situation? We already pray a lot! How do you want to get there? Take Route Frères. Have you been in Port-au-Prince for long? -No. -What are you doing here? Right now, I'm working in Port-au-Prince. I'm a lawyer by training, and also a social worker. I'm involved in the struggle for women's rights in Haiti. It's not easy, but we're holding up. You see these women? They are the heads of their families. They have a lot of children. I have women like this in my family. They're what motivate me. I watch my aunts, my close friends, my neighbours, they work hard all day long, but they do in the informal sector. These women have never had access to regular resources. All the problems you see have to do with how our society was built. The stubborn patriarchy is the underlying cause of every problem in this society. You see? For example, if I do an amazing job, - and I notice this all the time - people don't congratulate me for my professionalism, they say: "Congratulations, you're a woman." That's what convinced me that we have to bring down this system. Everyone has a role to play in achieving gender equality. -You know what I'm saying? -Yes. Looks like there was a fire here. Yeah, I saw that. It's the crisis. There was a fire. -It's the crisis. -Yes. I don't think it has anything to do with the protests. I don't know. It's complicated. Hi, how's it going? We're totally stuck. There's someone in the car with me. Any news of the situation? How are things going? Hold on, let me ask someone. Excuse me, do you know anything about the situation on the streets? The protest is coming to Pétion-Ville. Anything can change from one moment to the next. The country is under a lot of stress. Jovenel thief We often hear the judges say that the street is for cars, the sidewalk is for pedestrians, and vendors should sell their wares in the markets. Oh my God, come on! You think the vendors like being out there, exposed to the sun, the dust, the rain? Can you understand the situation? It's a really big problem. It's a problem that I addressed in my first book, Feminism and Social Activism in Haiti. This issue of vendors that invade every street, especially in Port-au-Prince, is very much connected to the larger problem of agriculture. The Haitian government and the international organizations encourage workers to leave the agricultural sector. But then what happens with all the out-of-work farmers? They come to the city. Little by little, as people jammed into the slums, our harvest started to come from humanitarian aid and from NGOs. What does that mean? It means you're giving charity. And the person receiving the charity can't say a word about it. It's this unhealthy relationship that brings us to our current situation where we have over a thousand NGOs from all over the world. From Canada, France, Germany, Belgium, etcetera. The international community tells us that we have to lower our customs tariffs. So we drop import tariffs to almost nothing, and people are out of work. So the NGOs say, "Those poor people, they have to eat! "We have to ship in something to eat. "We'll bring them rice, corn and oil." So it's clear that the thing that has to change radically is this kind of perverse relationship with the so-called international community. We know that from some countries, big industrialized capitalist countries, and international organizations like the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, the IDB, etcetera, what we only got is a fatal assistance. They infantilize the Haitian state, which no longer takes any responsibility for anything. There's this idea of the White Man who comes to fix everything, but today, we can clearly see that what the Haitian people want is to take care of their own affairs. What a big church! Yes, and it's close. This church is open every day of the week. Careful here. The road's no good. We'll see if we can get through. We'll see if this is truly a zo reken. These cars! Try to back up a bit. It's not solid, I can feel it under the wheels. There was a camp further down, but they tore it down. But this camp is still here. It's been here the whole time. Really? It's been here for a long time, since the earthquake. We forgot about it. At one point, we really believed in NGO aid. But after the earthquake, the NGOs saw the Haitian people in a different light, and we got a different perspective of the NGOs as well. Now, no one trusts them anymore. The people have come to understand that NGOs operate like an industry in spite of the country's poverty. They pay out all their money in employee salaries and they buy all these big cars. In fact, NGOs popularized the zo reken in Haiti. I've heard that there's a certain distrust of zo rekens. Zo rekens symbolize the NGOs that bring aid, but the government has been using them more and more. The police have a fleet of zo rekens that they use to break up protests. We've seen a few zo rekens carrying armed personnel that fire on the population. It's disgusting. When shots are fired, they say: "Watch out, there's a zo reken firing at civilians!" That mostly happens in cities outside the capital. You can divide this money between you. You have to share it. Are you going to give him his share? Are you sure? Yeah, sure. Trust me. I'll divide it up. Divide it up among you. He's a thief. Why did you lie to him? Go talk to him. All right. You can't have much of a brain if you believe him. Have a good day. That was a good example of how people are so precarious here, they no longer show any solidarity. That's a big problem. So many people are living in desperation, but it's each to their own, dog eat dog, because what little they get is not enough to share with others. They don't live in a situation where they can watch out for each other. Did you find what you were looking for? Yeah, I got medication for my high blood pressure. You know, these days in Haiti, with the situation here, we all have terribly high blood pressure. And it's really dangerous. At my age, there's a high risk of heart attack. The hospitals here, and the very few health centres we had in Haiti have been completely defunded. When the international groups came after the earthquake, they barged in and offered free health care services, which meant that the structures we had in place could no longer function. They did two things: they poached all the local trained medical personnel, paying them much higher salaries to work for them, and they provided free health services. So Haitians stopped going to locally run health centres. Today, the international community that had come to help, - and I thank them, I'm not spitting on their support - they're going home, leaving behind a public healthcare system that is completely out of date. Hello. Is the Haitian Community Hospital this way? May lightning strike me down! Whites! We're not playing anymore! We're hungry! Go fuck off! You see how aggressive they are? Yes, very aggressive. There are rocks on the road. I'm so traumatized that when I see rocks somewhere, I think they are a barricade. -But that was a barricade. -Alright then. At Delmas intersection 32 they want to know who's coming to stop the protesters from putting up barricades. They're waiting for people to come and clear the barricades away. You can come in. Get comfortable. We'll try to find a way with the fewest barricades. If I go up the Route Frères, there will be barricades, so I'll go through Vivi Michel. -Are you comfortable? -Yeah, I'm okay. Hello? How are you? I'm not good at all. I got beaten up. I was on the road. Since Sunday I've been at the Haitian Community Hospital. Now I'm on the road heading to Bernard Mevs Hospital. My jaw is broken. I'm with Fred. I can't talk for long. I'll call you when I get the chance. The doctor said that when I talk too much, my blood pressure goes up. What happened to you? I was on Bourdon close to the Catholic School. We heard on the radio that the protest wasn't far away. Some men left the protest on motorbikes and whenever they met anyone on the street, they searched them and beat them up. When they got to me, they took my bag and then they beat me up. And then I fell down the stairs. Some people passing by came to my aid. We were going to go to La Paix Hospital. I saw a man lying on the ground. He'd been killed. You didn't see what had happened to him? I just saw him dead on the ground. When I got to La Paix Hospital, they told me they couldn't treat me there. They sent me to the Community Hospital. We're transporting an injured man. We're going to the hospital. Thanks. Let them through! Tell him to move. Thanks. Am I turning here? Go over to the blue jeep. Towards the guy selling cigarettes on the left. Yeah, on the left. He doesn't see me. They don't recognize me because I'm not in my car! In the street, people only know you by the car you drive! Who are you trying to flag down? That guy in the ball cap. Excuse me! Someone here wants to talk to you. Go to the other side, someone wants to talk to you. It's me. How's it going? I heard that a couple of days ago, young men were killed in the area. Yes. Eight people were killed close to Mapou. On this side, close to the flowers? No, further down at the cross street close to Barak. Close to Barak? By Mapou? Yes. A lot of people were killed close to Mapou. I was home at the time. It was a massacre. Twelve or thirteen people were killed. In the middle of Pétion-Ville on Monday night. The dead bodies were taken away in black bags. They took them away? We knew some of the people. Was there anyone present that wasn't killed? Are there witnesses? We knew some of these young people. Did you find the bodies the next day? Yes. They were some young street kids. I don't get why it's not all over the news and on the radio. I was wondering that yesterday too. I called those who started talking about it. Send me photos. I find it so weird. There was no outcry. It's a massacre. Almost like the one at La Saline. One of them died at the hospital from loss of blood. His friends are asking for money to organize a funeral this week. It's a massacre. Where are the bodies? There's not a huge difference between this and La Saline. Eighteen people in Pétion-Ville. I knew at least four of these young boys. -Do you know their names? -No. What were they doing? Caravel was shot. He was a hard liquor vendor. He lived by Chez Matheis. Caravel, like the soccer team. What was his real name? I don't know. Caravel? Where did he live? Is he dead? Where was he killed? He lives on Route Frères. Across from Chez Matheis. His name is there on the wall. That's where he lives. He organized social activities around soccer games. Caravel isn't his real name, it's his nickname, right? It's the nickname that everyone knew him by. What was he doing here? Passing by. He was passing by and he stopped for a few minutes to talk to a friend. He ended up getting gunned down. And who else? You say there were others you knew? I only know their faces. They lived in the area. I don't know their names. But their families... -Makendy. -Makendy? He died at the hospital yesterday. I'm going to send this to the journalists. It was a massacre. Not that different from the killings at La Saline. They left some bodies on the ground and drove off with the others into the night. They put some of them into the car, but it was too small to hold them all. Some of them went to the hospital, where they died. We can't tolerate this regime. We've had enough. This is even worse than Duvalierism. Ma'am, these kinds of things didn't happen under Duvalier. The car that they used... A zo reken. They put some of the bodies in the car and left others on the ground. That's when he was still alive. -That's Makendy? -Yes. We demand justice for our brother, who died in questionable circumstances. He died at La Paix Hospital. Street kids, mother. -Is that Makendy? -Yeah, Makendy Texani. We demand justice. I'm in my own country, I was born here, in the heart of the Caribbean, why can't I walk in the street in Pétion-Ville? When I was at the hospital yesterday, they were just finishing operating on him. He was okay, he was speaking normally. When we were with him, a group of chiefs came in. -Policemen? -Yeah. They came in and talked to him. Our friend was speaking really well. He asked us to buy him something to eat but he wasn't allowed to be eating or drinking. I was at the hospital around 10am, and then around 3 or 4, I went home. When I got back to Jalousie district, they called me to say that he'd died. When the chiefs were done talking to him, they gave him some medication. Maybe that's what killed him. The chiefs said they were asking questions for the investigation? I think so. You were there, did you see them? Was it policemen in the car, or civilians? We didn't see their faces. What were they wearing? They just rolled down their windows. They were all in black, with masks. They rolled down the windows, pointed their guns and rained down terror. I didn't see the faces of any of the men that did the killing in the streets on Monday night. May God bless them. I hope they kill me before they get what they deserve, because God sees their actions. We were born in Port-au-Prince, this is where our roots are. We accept cruelty with strength and courage because we believe God is with us. They kill the people non-stop. One day, they will be killed by the people. Their fate will be worse than ours because someone will have bigger guns than them. We believe in our power. We are Black maroons. We're not scared. We're from here. We believe in our magic. We demand justice. -What is your name? -Mario. -Call me tomorrow. -Okay, no problem. Mother! We're counting on you, my dear! I make no promises. I'm going to try and lend a hand. If a door is closed, I'll try to help you open it, because I have more resources than you. Mother, help us! We don't have enough resources. You need money to hold funerals for how many people? Only Makendy. We don't know about the others. But Makendy is our brother. He had no mother, no father. Where is his family? We're right here. Since he's been on the street, he's been part of our family. But his real family? They are here. Can I contact one of them? You can go to his wife or his uncle if you want. His mother and father are dead. His uncle and aunt and his sister and wife are here. We'll see tomorrow. He left behind a baby that's not even two months old yet. His baby is a month and three days old. He called the kid Ti Petro. I heard that he was killed because of that name. Miss, I'm telling the truth, it's really terrible. We live in a country that has been turned upside down. When Jovenel leaves... Mother, whatever happens, Jovenel will leave. Anyway, thank you mother. I applaud your courage. The system must fall. We're not scared of them. Tell them that the day will come when they will be the ones to die. Tell those thieves who killed my brother that we're not scared of them. We are firebrands. If they come, we'll grow horns. We are the sons of Bois Caïman. We, the Black maroons, are not scared of these shits! The State never serves The powerless The unfortunates who perish Those who suffer in life But the State is well placed To kill them when it wishes And defend the interests of the few To please the bourgeoisie It is never defined I mean the word bourgeoisie So everyone can know Exactly what it means There's so much old debris Their dream is to make a killing They are ready to compromise anything Even betray their family If you want to protest That's your right because you're exploited Unfortunately you're in the minority And the bourgeoisie has the State That it can send to control you People, stand upright Your fate is in your hands Open your eyes to keep watch On those who use you To settle their own affairs I have a problem with the word "White". It symbolizes... The word "White" in Haiti doesn't refer to a person's colour. "White" means "foreigner". Take the example of a soldier from the UN Mission in Haiti: his skin might be black, but he speaks English. So he's a White. It's nothing to do with his colour. Today, we need someone who can look the Whites right in the eyes and tell them what we want. "This is what we want." We don't need any more NGOs. We don't want foreign aid. Yeah, but we have to say that. Foreigners have messed a lot of things up in this country. Haitians are really courageous. I doubt we'd see that happen on the other side. Young people who wake up every day and go out to get shot at. They get up every day and stand up to the power. That's a very courageous thing. You don't see that happening elsewhere. It's a rare thing. When I go to bed at night, the gunfire keeps me awake. I want to go to sleep but I can't. It's the masses that suffer in these revolutions. That's the problem. It's the people and the children that suffer and die while others have it easy. I wanted to buy $20 of rice today and as I waited in line, they jacked up the price. So we suffer the consequences. When you were waiting in line? As you're buying it, they raise the price. We have to pay for it. They're making a fortune off of us. We have to move in and settle the situation. We have to address all of the problems. Is it possible to fix all the problems? This isn't the first time that this kind of thing has happened. We need men of integrity who are aware and capable. Our president said: "Cross the sea to improve your life." In any other country, he would have resigned after a declaration like that. The system and the president are two different things, you know. He's not alone. A simple question: if your father didn't know how to drive and wanted to take you to Les Cayes, would you get in the car with him? No, I wouldn't go. Good question! That's what I'm saying. Should we elect someone simply because they are well-intentioned? Is that a good enough reason to vote for someone? And that brings us to the question of the level of public education. If we need a revolution, nothing is more important than making it happen. The Haitian people are never ready for that. Let me put it very simply. If we hadn't done anything in 1986, would we be here talking about it? They would have called us a riot. Let me explain. In '86, anytime there were more than 10 people meeting together, it was considered an uprising. That means the army could come in and fire on you just because there were more than 10 people together. This is very important. Listen to me. In '86, if you got a high school diploma, you had to hide it. People had to hide it because if you were getting an education, you could rise up against Duvalier. You can't say that '86 was pointless. Today, if we can talk openly, if journalists can interview people, it's because of '86. Lots of young people died for '86. A lot of people don't realize it. "Don't forget '86", like Jovenel says. He doesn't know what he's talking about. This is the movement that led to the Arab Spring. It's what happened in Haiti in '86 that led to the Arab Spring. And now in 2019, we can give rise to other revolutions, other revolts in other countries. I really think we have to ask the questions that will help to bring us out of this mess. Exactly. That's clear. A Haitian poet once said, "Ask your questions to the walls. "If they don't answer, knock them down." My back is wide The rulers are putting their burden on my shoulders My back is wide A patriot in need of help can put his burden on my shoulders I struggle for my country For the good of this land, for the people We are ready to die We are so close to death We're not afraid of death So that this people can live Oh yes. For everyone. A country for all is one that should benefit all of its citizens. Not just a small group of individuals named Lavalas, Makout or PHTK. The people should benefit from all of this country's resources. The country is for the Haitian people. And we are ready for this sacrifice. So the people may live. Oh yes. The Bible says, in Lamentations 4:10, "Those who die in war are better off "than those who accept to live "on their knees." Why should we live on our knees? Why beg for our living? Why live in filth? In promiscuity? That's not living. That's not life. That's mere existence. A little white aristocracy wants to make us into slaves, into a people on the margins, into a misguided people. They behave like colonists and the people like slaves. No, we say no. This is not possible.
