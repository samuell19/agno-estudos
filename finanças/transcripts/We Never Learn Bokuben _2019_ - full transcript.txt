I think It's interesting so I get involved. As a result, I have to go too. Church bells blessing [x] Church bells blessing [x] Getting married? I'm back. Welcome back, honey. I'm your leprechaun, Asumi! Do you want to eat first? Or take a bath first? or will be something else... Do you want a paid special service? Wait! Why am I in the working mode? Besides, the future I'm going to be... I'm going to be something likes this. In that case, I think the junior will be the head of the hospital. Junior. He's used to the hard days and he's probably qualified to run a small clinic like mine. Besides, why is he a junior? So, it's almost time to eat. A pamphlet for the wedding venue? Why is there such a thing in the house? Don't tell me... Is this Asumi's? But she still sticking to the examination of the medical university why would she do that at a time like this? Is there a reason to have an early wedding? Asumi! How many months now!? Don't tell me... Marry after having child. Now, I'm pregnancy I'm finally going to be a grandfather! Now, I'm pregnancy I'm finally going to be a grandfather! Do you know the gender of your child? If possible, the child's name is up to me. What nonsense are you talking about! Damn old man! The bride really makes I look forward to. Speaking of which, the waist of the wedding dress seems to be very tight? I've heard that brides can't eat much wedding dishes because their stomachs are too tight. Wait, wait, it's not good! This does not exceed the standard value of a girl! Don't tell me... Am I a fat paramecium? If still going like this, I'll be... chubby... like this. No!! This one, I have to do something! If you want thin waist, of course, stretch. I'll keep practicing everyday until I get six-pack. Ah... I can't hold it. I can't practice like this. No, give me a break. Nice, I'm sweating. Anyway, today's practice is enough? After all this time, I should be able to... Stretching, burning calories. If I'm eating a little bit, nothing should be problem. The snack after the exercise is really delicious! I was planning to buy some new reference books. But I really don't know which one to buy. Maybe I should ask Nariyuki-san come with me to choose better? By the way, I was invited to the bridal fair. No matter what kind of test, as long as it's ready, it's safe. Even Nariyuki-san is always talking about this, I think I'm better prepared. There seems to be a lot of notes. But I've had no interest so far, so I don't know what I want to know. If only someone could teach me... Sekijou-san. Ogata Rizu! Today, Are you coming alone? T- This is! Sekijou-san. I want to talk to you about getting married. ※Sawako's view. I want to talk to you about getting married. Ogata Rizu told me about getting married!? Sawako-san. What? Rizu. I see. that's the thing. Yes. Really, it's no wonder that I'm suddenly thinking about marriage. But even if you ask me about marriage, I can't answer you in detail. After all, I've never been married. No, just tell me something basic. Apparently, why should people get married? You just come up to ask a fundamental question. That's because... You know, when you get along, you think the other side is pretty good. Get along... Is that a date? Y- Yes... Well, I guess that's it. Wait, Wait! That's not what I'm thinking about for a date! If it's a dating relationship, then they're lovers. What does it take from this relationship to getting married? So from this relationship continues to deepen. How can I say? It's to have deep relationship with each other. Deep relationship? It's to become more intimate with each other. In other words, the two people started flirting... In other words, after the lovers started flirting, they will get married. But I don't think all lovers end up getting married. Is there any chance they could do this? That's the one taking responsibility. Responsibility? Responsibility for what? For what... that's... - Sawako - Rizu S- Sekijou-san! What's wrong with you? Sekijou-san! Sekijou- san Ascend... Mock test A few days later Nariyuki! Sorry to keep you waiting! Oh, Uruka. How about mock test? If you don't forget where you don't understand, go home and review it then. I'm sorry, Nariyuki, to let you stay with me so late. Nothing need to say now. But what's wrong with you? Based on your mock test's result today, it seems that there are more points lost because of mistakes than ever before. Well, it's because... I can't tell you how much I've been distracted by the bridal fair lately. I couldn't concentrate. Huh? Is that Kobayashi and Umihara on the bench over there? Oh, it's true! They're here for the mock test, too. But what are they doing so late? Hey! Haruma-kun. The bus is coming soon, isn't it? Okay! Let's go Chinami-cham. Ok! I thought I was going to suffocate. I didn't even notice. Really? Don't tell me, Kobayashi... Me, too! Umichi didn't even show it. I just see something that's amazing! Anyway, let's sit down on a next bus. Agreed. S- So awkward. This long-time close friend suddenly ascended the adult ladder of the state of mind. It's no wonder. Kobayashi is handsome and nice. Kiss. Nariyuki got a kiss with someone else, aren't you? No, that's not so much a kiss. It's not that good at all. I see. Next stop is Futaba high school. Next stop is Futaba high school. Passengers who need to get off the bus, Please press the signaler to let us know you want to get off. Will I have this day in the future? The day I can do something like that with someone. Nariyuki. Are you asleep? Nariyuki... W- What's wrong? Nariyuki. You just shudder... Next stop is Nanao District Center. - Next stop is Nanao District Center. - Ah! Next stop, Nariyuki. - Next stop is Nanao District Center. - Next stop is Nanao District Center. Dream?! Eh? Where? What's this? So embarrassing! What's matter? It seems you have a weird dream. Just little... What kind of dream? N-Nothing special! Nothing! You're so weird, Nariyuki. What a vivid dream! Eh? Pair mug? Yes, a souvenir from my wedding. do you have one? Are you using it? Yeah, sort of. Well, that means you got a boyfriend. No! Oops, I thought you were so busy with your work and not thinking about it. Now I feel relieved. So rude! I'm at least as good as my age. Then, you must come, too. Here you go. Bridal Fair Experience There is nothing to refuse, I replied to her that if I had free time, I would go then. But should I seriously consider the big things of my life? But... I'm back. Oh! Welcome back, Sensei. Stop saying "Sensei". Because right now... Oh, that's it. It's just blurt out. The meal will be ready soon. I'm going to eat. Thanks for your hard work everyday. Amazing. Nice. That's it. Right... Do it deeper... That's good. Failure... I feel like I'm indulging in a life of unbridled pleasures, dreaming my desires at a glance. Welcome! I still waiting for you. Let's start with the renovated church. Guests can pick up souvenirs in this area. It's a lot easier to choose than just watch catalog. There are a lot of options that are good, but there are so many kinds. It could be confusing. There are tweezers and peelers. Is it really this kind of daily use items will make the guests happy? It depends on the guests ' preferences. This is... Here you can try out some of the dishes and desserts actually used for wedding ceremonies in the form of a buffet. Oh! Can I eat as much as I want? Uruka-san. Uh~m! every of them so yummy! Don't eat too much, you know, the waist of your wedding dress seems tight. Okay, It's done. You're so beautiful. Come on, let's go take a picture. Getting married is harder than I thought. Oh, the teacher wanted to be a bride, too. T- This one... Amada-san asks me for help. If it's request from classmate, it can't reject. Oh, I didn't tell you. I and Kirisu-san are classmates. Eh?! I'm not fit to wear this kind of clothes anyway. It doesn't like that. You're very beautiful. Come on, you guys, get dressed, too. Then go to the church to take a souvenir photo. It's fun to be with someone you're not good at. Thank you. 苦手も君とならやっぱ楽しい、サンキュー！ nigate mo kimi to nara yappa tanoshii, sankyuu!
