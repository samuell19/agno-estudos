[up-tempo music playing] [woman yelling]...Eighty dollars short... [indistinctive voices] [woman] Now, what are you talking about? You never come home with nothing! Now I want that? And the $80? [indistinctive voices] [woman] Yeah, well you gonna go out in a second if you don't get that money! [man] You can't? Man! [woman] Why do you think I'm living out here? [woman] Oh, don't give me that! I'm.... [door closes] [Tige] I'm home. Hope you brought something that don't need cooking. They cut off the gas today. We can still use the hot plate, can we? I got some pork and beans and some lunch meat for us. I didn't even think about that. Yeah, go ahead and plug it in for me. I'll heat up some of that meat and open up one of those cans of beans, is that okay? [Tige] Yeah, that's okay. [crying] ...and over here, he tries it on Cinderella. And it fits. [chuckling] And then her fairy godmother comes back and casts a spell. And makes her all dressed up beautiful again. The prince has found his bride. They, they get married, and they live happily ever after. The end. Well, what happened to her step sisters? And her step mamma? I don't know. Doesn't say. What do you think happened to them? They all threw up. [chuckles] You crazy little boy. Go on and into bed. It's too early to go to bed. Don't give me any back talk. Go on to bed. Ain't you forgetting something? Would you wipe that frown off your face and get back over here? You ain't got but one mamma. As if you didn't know it. I didn't appreciate my mamma while she was alive neither. I appreciate you. You just get sloppy, that's all. Can I even be motherly if I want to? [Vanessa] You're all I got, Tige. [Vanessa crying] [Tige] Mamma? Mamma? Mamma? Mamma, you asleep? Mamma? [tearfully] Mamma! [Tige sobbing] What's your name please? I'm Carrie Carter. [officer #1] And this is your residence here? [Carrie] Yeah, I live here. [officer #1] How long have you known the deceased? [Carrie] Ten or 12 years, I guess. [officer #1] What's your phone number, miss? My number's 794-8733. Does he have nay next of kin? No. Poor child, he ain't got nobody. If it's all right, he can spend night here. Could he? Sure, I'll have the Welfare Board come over tomorrow and pick him up. [knocking at door] [Carrie] Tige? Come on out of there, baby. Now, you can't stay in there. It ain't good for you. Tige? [glass clanking in trolley] That's gonna hurt. Have to go, that's one of the most painful ways. Problem is... Problem is with that, you could lay around for three or four hours... before anything happens. Or someone could come along, get you to a hospital... and the doctors could save your life. Then they call in a psychiatrist. And he probe and he search and he try to find some reason why an eight year old kid would try to kill himself. Eleven. What? Eleven. Eleven? Excuse me. Then they say, "He undoubtedly was unhappy about something." Maybe some tragedy in his life he can't cope with. Mamma dead. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, I really am. She the only, only family you have? Yeah, I... I can see how that would... Make a person feel lost. But if, if you're a hundred percent sure you wanna die, and I, I could suggest some other ways... You see there's gas, uh, electrical... uh, shock, uh, jumping from a building, sleeping pills, poison, uh, hanging, uh, and if you can find a gun, the old reliable bullet in the head, which rarely, if ever, fails. But, on the other hand, if, if you feel that you... could at least live one more night, I'd invite you home for a bowl of chili. [chuckles] And you, you could get some rest, and sleep on it. And you could start again in the morning. That's the way you should do things! Would you like to come home with me? You don't have to if you don't want to. But I really don't think that you... Should be out here all by yourself. The boogeyman could get ya. Ain't no boogeyman! Oh, you may be right about that, I, I wouldn't know. I never, I never stayed out that long to find out. Well, you coming or not? I... [barely audibly] I don't care. [normal voice] Whatever you wanna do. [glass clanking in trolley] [Marvin calls out] Coming? Turn all these in tomorrow. Twenty dollars' worth here. Pretty good living from bottles and cans. [Marvin sighs] [Marvin huff out a breath] Oh, by the way... [sighs] My name is Marvin. [chuckles] [chuckling] That's a terrible name, Marvin, I know. Every time I hear the name Marvin I think of a man with a big nose. Big black glasses. Brown shoelaces. [chuckling] White socks and little bow tie. [laughing] And checkered jacket. Ah! Anyway, make yourself at home. Oh! You know, one thing I like about this place... It heats up fast, there're no drafts here. Warm. I gotta heat up that bowl of chili for you. I made this fresh yesterday. So you're not gonna get ptomaine or anything. [Marvin whistling "Jungle Bells"] Would you like to join me? Ah, c'mon, don't-- C'mon, don't do that. No, don't, don't do that! Don't cry! Don't! Damn! On second thought, maybe... I don't know, maybe it's good to let it all out. [sighs] Because you know what makes you cry, don't ya? No, not just you, anybody. It's thoughts. And feelings, that does it. You know, it starts right up here in your head, and, and... These sad thoughts, trigger a reaction... And when these depressing, aggravating and sad thoughts collect, it's like decongesting a head cold. The... thoughts start right up here in your forehead and goes straight out of your eyes in the form of tears. And the more you cry, the more of these depressing feelings you get rid of. [sighs] And you start to feel better. [chuckling] Yeah, I think some of those, those bad feelings are gone already. There. It is a little better, isn't it? [burning sound] Is it? [chuckles] Your stuff's burning. [Marvin] What? Oh. So much for dinner! [groans] [pan sizzling under cold water] Didn't do my grocery shopping for this week. Is that for me? What about you? I ain't hungry. Well, thank you very much. Sure you don't want half? [chuckles] What's your name, by the way? Tige. I beg your pardon. Tige. Tige. What's that, a first name or a last name? First. My last name Jackson. Tige. That's a handsome name. Unusual. Is it African, or what? You see a bone stuck in my nose? I didn't say you were African. I only said... Never mind. What about your father? Is he dead too? Asked my mamma one time where my dad was. She said he don't give a damn 'bout me. As far as he concerned, we dead. -So was he. -[Marvin chuckles] Wanna lie down? There's a bed inside there. You want some music? You like music? You mind it? Put some music on. [classic piano music playing] Well, good night to you too. [Marvin snoring] [store man] It's closing time. Time for little boys to be getting home. [knocking at door] [Marvin] Who is it? -[Tige] Tige. -[Marvin] Tige? [Tige] How much company do you get? Well, hello again. Hey. [Marvin] C'mon in, it's cold out there. Take it you didn't find a place to stay tonight other than here? That's okay. You can stay here tonight. I could use the company. Take your coat off, there's a closet right in here. Oh, the coat on the door. That way you can see if anyone tries to steal it. Or possibly for a quick getaway. I think it's good to be cautious, but... I do give people the benefit of the doubt, and trust, sometimes. Ah, there's a couple of fish sticks in the pan, if you're hungry. [sniffs] [yawning] You ain't got no television, do you? I have a deck of cards, wanna play? [Tige] Okay. You know how to play 'Old Maid'? 'Old Maid'? Yeah. See, it's the old maid. Ah. I thought you were gonna say poker or something like that. What's the matter with you? Well, I thought, I assumed that you knew poker, that you, dice, gambling. You must think I'm like Mojo. Who's Mojo? Just a stupid creep who lives across the hall from me. He does all them things. Man, you know how to play 'Old Maid' or not? Oh, I know, I... [chuckles] Play 'Old Maid'. Take out all your pairs first. You know, Mojo gonna end up just like his brothers. In jail. Miss Carrie got her hands full with them niggers. [Marvin] Who is she? She's a nice lady. She got a good job too. She was gonna come let my mamma live with her. Finished taking out all your pairs? Gotta take turns pulling from each other now. Got it, got it. So when do you go back to Miss Carrie's instead of running amuck and trynna do yourself in? Well, think would like living with her, if it wasn't for that Mojo. Man, that nigger never gonna amount to nothing. And you? What are you gonna amount to? Who, me? I might not even make it till 12. Much less trynna amount to something. It's a pretty rough statement to make, there. So what? It's true though. Look what happened to my mom. Almost followed. Except for you. Well, maybe I'm your guardian angel, Tige. I ain't gonna knock it. Maybe you is. Are not is. Are not is what? You are, not you is. Don't use 'is' with you. How come? It mean the same thing, don't it? Possibly, but it... It's just not the way it was intended to be. Well, I couldn't care less. You saying nobody ever had no trouble understanding what I'm talking about. Don't see what the hell you complaining about neither. Hey. Don't talk that way, right? It's my house. I don't like that. Did you hear me? So don't say 'hell'. All right? I can say whatever the hell I want. Hey, you can say what you wanna say, but you don't say what you wanna say, around me. You plan to stay here, just remember that. This is my home. Let's get it straight. What I say goes. If you don't like that idea... there's the door. I ain't gotta do nothing you tell me. And I ain't gonna stay here. Yeah, where will you go? Who the hell cares? Well, I do. I, I, I do a little, I suppose. You know, if you-- you don't have any place to go, otherwise you would have done so. Why don't we try meeting each other half way on things, not all your way, not all mine? There now. That solves one problem right there. As long as you're not talking, you can't swear at me. I'm going to bed. You do what you like. [Tige] I'll leave in the morning. [Marvin] What? [raising his voice] Said I'll leave in the morning, man! -[Tige sighs] -[Marvin] That's what you want. [Marvin] You know [chuckling] you don't need a lot of money, really to live. You know what you need? [Tige] What? [Marvin] A terrific sense of humor. You know where it comes from? -[Tige] Where? -[Marvin] The Sun. You can't look at the sun -without smiling! -[Tige laughing] [Marvin] You really don't notice that? [Tige] Nope. ["Jungle Bells" music playing] [baby crying] -[Santa] C'mon, sit closer. -[little girl crying] -[Santa] Well... -[little girl] Mamma, mamma. [Tige] Don't you like girls, just cause they girls? [Marvin] Girls? What are girls? Girls are birds. What do you mean, "I don't like 'em?" How can I not like 'em? What would the world be without 'em? [Tige] You sure don't act like it. You ain't no fag, is you? [Marvin] Hey! [chuckling] Just cause I don't go around picking up girls, doesn't mean I make it a practice of picking up guys. I'm a guy. You picked me up. Yeah, well, we're all entitled to our mistakes, you know? Look, they got another one. [choir singing Christmas songs] Beautiful tree. [Tige] Yeah. Is that the biggest tree in the world? No, it's not the biggest. Pretty close though. -[choir continues singing] -[Tige] You all right, Marv? You need a heavier coat. Nah, I'm all right. It ain't cold out here. -[Marvin] You sure? -[Tige] Yeah. Suit yourself. Get over here, before you freeze your rump off. [Tige] Hey, Marv? Is this gonna be another one of these "Hey, Marv" night's? I need a bedtime story. Bedtime story? You? -[Marvin laughing] -[Tige] Yeah. Like kids get 'em, don't they? -Okay. -Ain't I good enough? [chuckles] Okay, okay. I'll tell you a short one, okay? Once upon aa time... There lived this little elf, in the beginning of this huge book. And he, one day, wanted to see how the other pages lived. So he went all the way back, page after page, page after page, till he got to the very last page. And low and behold, what do you think it said? -What? -Good night. [Tige sighs] Oh, man. [Marvin sighs] I never said I was Mother Goose, did I? -[Tige laughs] -[Marvin] Go to sleep-- What? What did you say? -[both laughing] -[Tige] Good night. [Marvin] Huh! [Tige] Ho, ho, ho. [Marvin] Ho, ho, ho. Oh! -[lady chuckling] -[Marvin] Say thank you. -[lady] Okay. -[Tige] Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas, thanks very much. Fifteen tiny little dollars. We fallin' behind, ain't we, Marv? Ah, don't worry about it. We get a little tight, we get more. Where? What did I just say? -Okay, okay. -Okay. [Tige trying to whistle "Jingle Bells"] -[Tige continues whistling] -All right, put it back. [chuckling] Hey, Marv. You scared me, man. I thought I asked you to go after some cereal for me. I was gonna get 'em for you. What, after you, you put everything in your pockets, -I suppose? -Just trynna help you out, man. Yeah, well don't help me that way. Just put it back. Back? I can't! Somebody might see me. [yelling] Somebody's already seen you. Me! Now, either you put it back in that cart, or you put it back where you got it from. And we're not leaving here until you do one or the other. What about my money? What about your money, what? Oh, I tell you, Tige. I can't give it to you right now. We got a lot of expenses. We got groceries, and... And other things. So, you just gonna take my money, huh? Without even asking me. [Marvin] Well... I didn't think you'd mind that much considering you pay free room and board. But it's still my money, man. You don't be taking my money on that kind of deal. You wanna eat tomorrow? I can get my own food. All right. That's the way you want it. Don't follow me around, will you? All right... One, two, three, four... Four... Fifty. I owe you $3, and then we're even, right? It's my money. I know it's your money. Can't we just drop it now? Go on, take your bath. I'll cook us some, something to eat. Go on. Scoot, go! Bang. Boom. Unbelievable. [yells out] You are unbelievable. I don't know how many times I've started this puzzle, and I lose interest and put it away. What's it picture of? That, my friend, is the greatest mystery of them all. [Marvin imitates evil laugh] Have to put it together and find out. -It is sure ain't easy. -A good puzzle never is. -Ah. -What about me? What about you, what? I want something to drink, too. Well, go on in the kitchen and get yourself a glass of milk. [Tige makes choking sound] Urgh! It tastes terrible. Don't see how you can drink that. Rarely does one drink for mere taste. However, they still do it. For what's your reason? Or do you got any? I have a reason. I think everyone has. Sometimes I drink to get high... Or to... Cure my nerves or... when I need a little courage. Ah... Think you-- you drink, hmm... To forget. Forget things. [chuckling] I guess I've used every one of those excuses from one time to another. Oh! But I, I don't, I don't need the drink. I don't have to. I just don't have a good reason to stop I guess. [Tige] You a alcoholic, ain't you? No, [chuckles] I don't think so. I don't know. Sometimes I want to. [Marvin takes deep breath] Drink the rest of that. -Why? -'Cause I want you too. Dink it. [Marvin groaning] Shows you ain't a regular drunk. You bet it does. [Tige] Marvin? Yes, what? If you want me to, I'll help you quit. [chuckles] No, I, I don't... Only alcoholics need help to quit. You just keep reminding me that I'm not one, okay? Okay. -Got two so far. -Hmmm. Uh, try to find the edges. Tige? You in the bathroom? You should've let me know. [Marvin] Where've you been all day? Man, I've been at school. [Marvin] What? Yeah! You know, one of those things with books and bells-- Yeah, I know what a-- I know what a school is. -And you went there? -Yeah. Well, you've been howling about me learning something, ain't ya? Did anyone ask you anything, the teachers or anything? Nah, get this, man. I told them all I was from out of town. [laughing] And I was checking out all the schools to see which one I wanted to go to. [Marvin laughs] They believe that, huh? Yeah! Well, see this, they don't know me like you do. So, tell me. What did you learn as school? Man, I learned a lot today. In one class they were showing a film about some dude named... Benjamin, who was on electricity. Benjamin, some-- what's the dude's name, man? -Franklin. -Yeah, that's him! -[Marvin chuckles] -That's him. Well, anyway, it was a cartoon film, right? And it was showing how this bald headed guy with hair was catching electricity with his cape-- -[Marvin laughing] -What's wrong? [laughing] And what they're sayin' lightnin' don't strike... -the same place two times. -[Marvin laughing] [Marvin] What? [Tige laughing] You know why that is? [Marvin laughing] Why? Because when lightnin' strikes that place... [laughing] [both laughing] I ate lunch too. Did you pay for it, at least? -No. -Did he? No, I, I didn't steal it either. You see, I told the teacher I had no money, right? And she bought it for me. Good, that's nice. That's very nice. See, it pays to be honest, that's good. I got these books so you can start teaching me something. -Oh. I'm no teacher. -C'mon! -You want me to teach you? -Yeah. Oh! I'm not a teacher, I'm not-- C'mon, Marv, man. You know I can't go to school. They gonna be trynna find out where I come from. Try to stick me in a home. Where did you get these books? From another kid? No, I swapped 'em. -You what? [chuckling] -No! I mean, I borrow them from the lib-ry. [chuckling] Yeah, but it's library, it's not lib-ry. -[stammering] Wh-- Li-- -Library. Libe-bwory. -Library. -Library, right? -Yeah. -Li-- Library! See that! I'm learning already! -Yep, great! -C'mon, man, let's get started. Which book we gonna use first? Okay, this-- which one? This... -Read that? -Can you read that? Wait. That right there's an 'A', right? Yeah. And that's a one? [Marvin] Yeah. Man, I don't think I can read the rest. The rest of it? You didn't read any of it, yet. An 'A' and a 'one', that's not reading. [chuckles] Well, I told ya I couldn't read to begin with. [Marvin under his breath] Oh my god! I never said I was no genius. Yeah, you never said you were illiterate, either. I mean, you should've stayed in school long enough to at least learn how to read! Man, I told you why I had to get out of school, I had to work! Yeah, I know, I know, I know. So, what do you want from me then? A miracle? I guess, you know I'm not so good with children. Still... You know, when you want something bad enough, you don't let what others do or say, turn you against it. Man, I wanna learn something. Anything. At least be able to write my name. And read a little bit. So I can be like other people. But man, the way you howl at folks... It's enough to scary them out of doing anything they wanted to. What's it say? Tige Jackson. Here. You take it, you practice on it for a while, I'm gonna cook us some dinner. -[Marvin] Forget that. -[both laughing] You're so slow. Slow down. Why can't you button up? [both chuckling] [Marvin] I had a nice time today. [Tige] Yup. -[Marvin] You? -[Tige] Yup. Nice bike. How much do you think a bike like that costs? Used to be $130,00. It's been reduced to $99,99. [Marvin] Ever owned a bike like that? Nah. I'll get it for you. How? How do you think somebody picks up something like that? Without having any money? Don't look like that. -You do it. -Man, I do it small. You steal something like that and you get caught, you go to jail. Okay, maybe I won't get caught. And don't try give it to me. You can't eat no bicycle. And you can't wear it neither. I've been going this long without things like that. I guess I can keep on going. You ain't gotta steal for me, Marvin. It ain't your style. You just ain't worth it. Come on, let's go home. Bye, bike. [both laughing] [Marvin] Ah, I love Christmas Eves. Still have that knife of yours? [Tige] Yeah, why? Let me borrow it a minute, I wanna get us a Christmas tree. [Tige] Here. [Tige] Ain't no Christmas tree! [Marvin] Yeah, a tree is just a tree. Got to add the Christmas to it yourself. Here's your knife. Thanks. What do you think? That's stupid. I guess it will do. [Marvin imitating evil laugh] It's beautiful. [Tige imitates evil laugh] Hey, Marv? Yes? Uh, what was Christmas like, back in your day? You mean back in the 1800's? Yeah, back then? Was you poor? No, I wasn't poor. My family was well off. It was special. Was very special. [Marvin sighs] It wasn't just receiving the gifts that made us happy, it was... The fact that we were all together. Where's your family now? Is, is they dead or something? No. Just my wife. Sorta lost track of everyone back then, when she died. Catherine, my wife... Very beautiful lady. And lovely green eyes. Was so long ago. Then she became ill, and the doctor told her she had a month to live. How do you tell somebody you have one month to live? Look them straight in the eye and say "Your life has been cancelled." And when she died... It was like the end of the word for me. I thought... [Tige] That's all right, Marvin. You ain't gotta tell me no more, man. -What? -You remembering too much, man. Ah, sometimes... Sometimes memories are all we have left. You not supposed to remember that bad stuff, man. Gotta remember the good things. -[church bells toll] -[kids shouting to each other] [Tige making car sounds] Merry Christmas to you too! Hey, are these for me? Hey, you'd be pretty embarrassed if they weren't, -now would you? -[Tige chuckles] Yeah. Do they fit? -I guess. -Give me your right foot. -By how much? -Come one, very funny. Let's go, right foot. Okay, hold on. [Marvin] Ah, ew! [chuckles] Ow! -[Tige laughing] -Oh my God. They fit fine. Aren't you gonna teach me how to skate? Yeah, no. No, you go practice for a while. I go, I gotta get some sleep, I was up half the night trynna find those things. [Tige in a sing-song voice] Marvin. Tige! -Yeah? -Later. [chuckling] [Marvin] All right, grab a hold of this. Good! Come on. Okay. Come on. Just try to be free. [woman] That's about it, Mr. Stewart. [Marvin] I understand, I understand. There's-- and there's no hope for adoption? -No. -Unless I can prove that he doesn't have any living relatives. -[Woman] Exactly. That's right. -Thank you very much, -for your help. -[woman] You're welcome. And uh, I'll fill out these forms. -[woman] Good. -Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.

I'd like to talk to Miss Carrie, about Tige Jackson. That poor child didn't have nobody. I almost wished I could take him. But I can't help him none. I got four of my own. With two in jail and one pregnant. I'm sorry to hear that, Miss Carrie. But Tige must have someone, somewhere. I understand his father's dead. Hmm, well, I doubt if he's dead. That's what Vanessa told Tige when he started asking about his daddy. I can't say exactly where he is, but... He's probably in Atlanta though. Lord, she wanted to marry him, ever since she met him! [smirks] She figured if she had his baby, she could hold on to him. That was eight, mmm, nine years ago. Never heard a word from him the whole time. What, you have his last known address? Or telephone number? I... I think I got his number here someplace. -Charlie? -[Charlie] Ma'am? Uh, look in that top drawer and bring me that little address book and a pen. I wanna ask you something, do you believe in God? -Yeah. -If you believe in God... then... you gotta believe that He created people to be different. Gave 'em a brain to think with, and a good-- and a capacity to love and understand. Maybe just waiting for us to put it all to use. [chuckles] But man, that stuff's been going on for years and years. Man, when He gonna come down and help us out? I think He will. I think He will. Ah, I think people are beginning to treat people more like people, instead of like, colors. You know? Like when I first met you, you were just like a... A little black child. Now you're, you're... You're you. You're Tige Jackson, you're you. What do you think of when you look at me? Hmm, I used to see just a... -a white man. -Hmmm. [chuckles] Well, now I see Marvin. You seem the same as me, now. -[Marvin] Aha! -Not black, but, you know? -Just the same. -[Marvin chuckling] For a person who don't even know what a question mark is, you're asking pretty good ones. A person is always saying, "I don't know." You do. [Marvin] Yeah. Okay. We'll, I love you too. We're all so happy. Let's go have some fun! Okay. Where shall we start? The scream machine! The scream machine? I tell you what, let's start with something a little closer to the ground. Ah, Marv! [Marvin] Oh, no, not for me. If you wanna try it, you go right ahead. You're young, you'll make it. C'mon! Try it with me, man? No. -[people screaming] -Yeah! Oh! -Oh! -[Tige laughing] Oh, my God! -Wow! Here we go again! -[Tige laughing] Oh! [Tige laughing] [Marvin grumbling] Ah... [indistinctive voices] Wait, wait. Oh-ho-ho. Ho-ho-oh! [laughing] [Tige singing] ♪ Ringle bells Ringle all the way ♪ Did they teach you the name of that song? I sing it the way I wanna. I can teach you the words. What do you have against me, me teaching you the words to a song? Oh, I see, I see. You just... You don't wanna learn anything, is that it? I know I'm not far away. Well, you don't know the words to the song. Look at that sign over there. Can you read that? Don't care. Yeah, but you really should you know? You need an education in order to find out what the world is all about. Listen, man, I already know what the world is about. It's about all your white crackers, especially them big ones. You know the ones that say "You gotta have an education". My mamma got turned out 20 jobs, 20! Just because she didn't have that little tiny piece of paper that says she learned all the things that they wanted. You're jealous, you know that? [chuckles] You're jealous! You're jealous of the more fortunate. But there're poor whites, as well as blacks, and, and every other race. Now, you wanna end up like your mother? No education, no hope for the future? You keep on going just the way you're going. Hey. Is that you're answer to everything? Just to walk away? Who says I won't die tonight, just like my mamma? And who says you won't live to be a 100? Now wait a minute! What are you gonna have to show for all those years? You need a wife, you need a home, you need kids, you need a family. You need a job! And you can make all that happen if you want to. Look who's talking! You've been through all this shit yourself, and what you got to show for it? Huh? A drunk! A liquor bottle and bad breath! Man, all that work you've been through, and you ain't got a damn thing! But I guess that's what the world needs, some more well educated drunks. Apologize! For what? It's all true ain't it? You don't insult people! You respect others, and they respect you. Pfft. Like hell they will! [yelling] Hey, listen! I asked you repeatedly not to swear, and I've asked you to try to act more like a human being. If you can't do those two simple things, -then you take a walk! -[Tige grumbles] I don't wanna see your black face again! Know what else you can do too? Yeah, I know what I can do! I know what I can do, don't tempt me, son! Go to hell, bastard! All right. Put that knife away. Just get it away. [yelling] Put it in there! Get it in your pocket! Get that in your pocket! You won't have any hands! Go on! I don't feel like playing games! [newsman] In sports tonight, two games in the MBA... [newsman continues speaking] [muffled voices from television] [newsman continues speaking] [newsman] ...a cold front has moved into the south and temperatures will be dropping into the lower teens, with the chill factor temperature below zero. There will be rain and high winds. [Marvin calling out] Tige! Ed? See that kids I was with? Yeah, I saw him a long while ago, went that way. [Marvin] Thanks! [Marvin] Tige? Tige? Can't stay out here all night. [Marvin] Think that's enough? -Think that's enough? -Yeah, it's enough. Whoop. All the way back. Now we take it. -[Tige coughing] -[Marvin grunting] All right, all right. Okay. All right, all right. -[Tige continues coughing] -All right, okay. [Marvin sighs] You say you won't live to be 12? [chuckles] With me around, you won't. [moaning and coughing] [Tige continues coughing] [coughing] I'm, uh, gonna give you a little bit of this. Okay now, open up. There you go. No, no, suck it all in. Lick the spoon now. C'mon. There you go. It won't do you any good at all. [takes deep breath and sighs] Look, I'm gonna take you to a doctor. I'm taking you to Grady. You gonna turn me over ain't ya? No, I gotta get you to a hospital. And I can't sit here... [stammering] I don't know what to do with you. I can't even take care of ya. [in sad voice] I don't wanna go to them people. Tige. Leave me alone, dammit! -C'mon. -Move, move. Move. Hello? Mr. Richard Davis, please? Who the hell are you anyway? What business is if of yours? Could I sit down? Actually... I'm nobody to be concerned about. I'm just a guy in the middle. I've been sort of a guardian to Tige, ever since his mother died. I guess, I should have told you that before. She died penniless and, she had no other relatives except for Tige. And I didn't see any harm in keeping him for myself, for a while. So why didn't you just dump him in an orphanage and be done with it? Well, now that I see as a perfectly good father... I don't have a son. I have three children, they are all girls. Now, look, Mr. Davis, I, I, I'm not trying to hand him back to you. I really don't care two cents about you, personally, or your family. My only concern is Tige. I came here because you're my only good candidate for help. What kind of help? Tige is sick, he's ill. Now he's dead set... against being admitted to a hospital because he' afraid he'll end up in state's custody. So, what do you want? All I want is for a doctor to look at him. I think I can handle the rest from there. But, the problem is, I just don't even have enough money for cab fare. So, if you could spare a little something, anything at all... You take me for some kind of fool or something? You expect me to believe that? You come walking in here from nowhere. I don't even know you. And you expect me to hand you some money because you asked me to? You gotta be crazy or something. Um, all you have to do is come home with me, and see for yourself. What's the matter, you afraid I might be telling you the truth? You so afraid of a little boy? [chuckling] I'm not afraid of anything. Then come with me. I'm not going anywhere with you. For all I know, you may be some kind of a nut who goes around digging things up on people and tries to blackmail them. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna pretend you never came in here. But if you try to play games with me... I'll be glad to take you on. So, why don't you just go out that door, the same way you came in. Would it be better if I brought him here to you? I would rather you get your behind out that door before I call the security guard and have you thrown out! Thank you very much for your precious time. Good day. [door slams shut] Tige? Tige? Wake up. Wake up. Oh God, no! Hey! [car horn tooting] Help! Stop! [driver shouting] You crazy? Please, I need help. I gotta get him to a hospital, please! -He's gotta... -[driver] All right, get in. [Marvin] I can't get him to wake up. He needs a doctor. -Well, what do we do? -Just bring him this way. [Marvin] All right. [loudspeaker] Dr. Anderson, to maternity please. I didn't have time to dress him. Sir, no need to explain. Dr. Ross to emergency. Dr. Ross to emergency. [Marvin] How is he? [Dr. Ross] As well as can be expected, he's in a coma now. [Marvin] A coma? What's wrong with him? [Dr. Ross] He's small, suffering from malnutrition. The odds aren't good. I'm sorry to say I've done all that I can for him, it's not up to me-- [Marvin] Wait a minute, wait a minute!Are you saying he's dying? [Dr. Ross] I'm saying that there's that possibility. [Richard] Hello? Hello? Mr. Davis? This is Marvin Stewart again. [Richard] What? You know what I told you before. Look, I'm not calling about money. I'm calling about your son. He's at Grady. And uh, he has pneumonia, he may not make it. Not that that really bothers you-- [click followed by dial tone] [loudspeaker] Dr. Anderson to maternity please. [heart monitor beeping] Please don't... Please don't die on me, son. [heart monitor beeping] [monitor continues beeping] [Marvin] Are you concerned, or curious? Little of both. Ah, you know, it was, it was such a shock to me. All of a sudden... I have had some time to think about it though. Listen... I've got a wife and three daughters... I know a... Man, how do you explain that to people? How do you, explain that to your family? I mean, I love my wife. He's still your son. [Richard quietly] Look, I told Vanessa to get an abortion, and I was gonna pay for it. I mean, it's not my fault. [Marvin grunts] -All that doesn't matter now-- -[Richard] She wanted me to give up my future and my wife, for her. I told her I couldn't do it. And so she cussed me out, spit on my face and told me to get the hell out and that's just what I did. I want my son to live, and I want to take him home with me. I'm sure she's told him a lot of things about me, but I don't care what she told him, I wanna try prove to him what his old man is really like. I wanna... Make it up to him. I wanna thank you for doing what you have for him. I'm willing to pay you for your troubles. Oh, that's not necessary. I didn't do it for money. Why did you do it? Loneliness. Tige? Tige? How you feeling? [croakily] Tired. Well, you had me so scared there for a while. You gonna be all right. This the hospital? Yup. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about them taking you away from me. I told them I was your official babysitter. They believed it? [chuckles] Well, they don't know me like you do. That's good. What's all this sh, shit they got stuck-- Hey! Watch your language! Oh. I meant "stuff". Okay. Who's he? Oh, that's, uh, the doctor. Thank you very much for your concern. I... know you have to go. So, I'll speak to you later. Hmm? Hey, um... [clears throat] I'll wait for you outside. -[Tige] hey, Marv? -[Marvin] Yes? Was... Was you scared I was gonna die? Yeah... A little. You were pretty sick. Oh man, don't you know I wouldn't leave you? Yeah, I know. Guess I should've known better. [Tige laughing] Man, you ain't supposed to do that to me, I'm a boy! Yeah, I... [stammering] I'm afraid I lost my head. Come here. What is it? Man, come down. Don't you tell nobody I did that. [Marvin chuckles] Ah... Don't worry I won't! You sleepy? A little bit. Gonna stay with me, Marv? I'll be right here. I want you to tell me a story before you leave. All right. Uh... I have a good one. Once upon a time, there was this fairly good-looking, middle-aged man... who met a little boy who'd been dipped in chocolate. And they lived happily ever after. Take it easy, partner, I'll see you later. Uh, Mr. Stewart? What was all that about? Why didn't you tell him who I really was? Uh, for one very... good reason. Mr. Davis, we don't want to excite or upset him. [Marvin clears throat] Ah... You know, just to find out that you're here, that's one thing, but to know that you wanna take him, from me, and you wanna take him, there's no telling what kind of effect that would have on him. So, I, I think we outta... play it slow. [Marvin clears throat] For now, I think it would be best if he came home with me. -With you? -Yes. I mean, you saw what happened with him, with me. I mean, he, he responds to me. He, he expects it from me. He's used to me. That way I can ease the truth out more gently. That's the way I see it. You may see something else. No, no, no, no, you, uh... You made me realize something anyway, I... [loudspeaker]...line one, please. Ah, he needs time to get used to me and... [chuckles] my family needs time to get used to him, now. Okay, we'll do it your way. Good... I'll get in touch with you when the time is right. Okay, listen, why don't you... I'm sure you're gonna need this. Why don't you take a few dollars? -No, I, I-- -No, no, please? That's not necessary, I told you that before. [getting upset] Let's get one thing straight, I love the boy. And once upon a time, I wanted to adopt him. I wanted to be his father. Now, if it wasn't for you, I, I would've tried. Now, don't try to pay me off, because... I didn't do this for you, all right? Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I-- You said you didn't have any money and so how are you expecting to take care of my son when he gets out? All right. And by the way, Mr. Davis, have you considered the fact that Tige may not take to you at all? Yeah, I've considered that, yes. Uh, he may hate my guts, I know that. But, I'd never be able to forgive myself if... I didn't... At least try to be a father to him. I mean, you can understand that, can't you? I'm afraid I can. Okay, thank you. [loudspeaker]Miss Hanson to reception area. [Tige] Yeah, and I sure hope there ain't no pieces missing. All right. Getting hot now. Think I'll paste this puzzles and put it on cardboard and hang it up? Man, I wish I knew what the picture was. Marv? Hey? Hey! You got it. Did you say something? I wasn't listening, I'm sorry. Marvin, why you up? You sick or something, man? No. No, just restless. Hey, can't-- [chuckling] can't pay any attention to us old folks, you know? We're just... Senile. Wondering around, trynna figure out our problems in the middle of the night. Yeah, my mamma used to wonder. She'd get up real late, she'd be thinking about money, bills and all that stuff. Sometimes she'd be thinking about me. Tired of me already, Marv? Ah, come on, come here. Come here, bird. Hey, you won't-- wouldn't talk to me at dinner. -And you're drinking again. -Yeah. You know what I was wondering? What? I was wondering... What would happen to you, if suddenly something happened to me. You plan on dying on me? No, not yet. I just want you to understand that we don't have the best... arrangement here. You know, I just get this... [grunts] You know what you need? What? You need clothing. And you need... Education, and you need... Regular meals. That's what you need. So I was just thinking about all that, and... I decided that you should have something better. Gonna send me away, ain't ya? No, I'm gonna do what I think is best. You know I'm gonna go to welfare people. Don't need no clothes, need no books, or need no education. Listen... [sighs] It's not an institution of any kind. It's, I, it's a family. And I met with him, and I talked with him... And have... [chuckles] And have three little girls, and they want a boy. And they've invited us to dinner tomorrow. Ain't going. Do you tell me what you ain't gonna do! [Marvin laughing] No, look. These are nice people, I'll make a deal with you, all right? You meet them, and then you decide. And... If you don't like them at all, then we forget about it, all right? And if you do like them... Just a little bit, then... we can work it out some other time. All right? How does that sound, I mean, does that sound fair? Yeah. It's all right, I guess. You sure you ain't dying? Positive. Okay. [Marvin] Get the door. So, who lives here? [Marvin] Richard Davis and his family. Richard Davis? Who the heck is Richard Davis? Your father. My father? Man, you lying. I ain't going in there. You're going in there with me. Otherwise, I'm gonna take you over my shoulders and carry you in. He's your father, he wants to see you. How come you telling me this after all this time? You making some kind of deal with them, or something? Same deal I made with you. You ain't gonna leave me alone with this guy, -is you, Marv? -Not if you don't want me to. Don't want you to. Hello, Tige. Hey. Um... Mrs. Davis? Uh... My name is Marvin Stewart. Come in. [Marvin] With all that going on, I don't see how he could resist. [kids playing] [Richard] I could pick him out the crowd. [Marvin] Good evening, Davis. [Richard] I'm sorry I'm late. [Marvin] Would you like me to call him in for you? No, no. He's having fun. Don't bother just now. Why don't we do a little talking in the den? Excuse me. [Richard] He's getting along with the girls, I see. Oh, he loves girls. Um... Is there a word for it, when... you're afraid to talk to somebody you don't know? I mean, I've been driving around for two hours trynna get the butterflies out of my stomach, and... Making up a speech or something, and... Trynna figure out some of the questions he might ask, and... Have some answers ready, you know? Well, I wish I could help you, but I can't. I think I've a pretty good idea of the first question, though. -Why after all these years. -That's the one, all right. [chuckles] Oh, boy. Is that what he said when you told him about me? Afraid so, Richard. Look, if this is going too fast for you... I could keep him a while longer. Oh, no, no, no, I want him, he's my son. I don't wanna put this off anymore. [Tige] Marvin? Marvin? Tige, we're in here. Come on in. Hey, man you should've seen the-- Oh. Tige Jackson, this is your father, Richard Davis. Hello, Tige. -Tige? -What? Don't you know how to say hello to a person? Oh. Hey. [sniffs] It's been a long time, huh? You know, I got something for you, Tige. Just something I thought you might like. It's a watch. It's very nice. So... What do you say? Thanks. [barely audible] Well done. You don't seem too thrilled to see me? Why should I be? I ain't seen you in this long. So, what's the big deal? You got your pretty house and your Cadillac. Ain't never cared two cents about me, right? And that watch... Man, this stinking ten dollar watch. You must think this gonna make everything okay, don't you? Well, it ain't. I bet you wished Marv never dug you up in the first place, don't you? I bet you wish I was dead. Just like my mom. -[Marvin] Hey. That's enough. -That's okay, it's okay, it's okay, uh, he can say anything to me he wants to, I owe him that much. But I'd like to do one thing first, okay? Uh, why don't you sit down? Come on, sit down. I, uh... I wanna tell you my side of the story. -[knock at the door] -Okay? And I know you hate me. -But I'd like it to be for-- -Excuse me, y'all? Daddy? Mommy said that dinner's ready, if anybody is interested. You sound like... [Richard] That's pretty good. Pretty good. [all chattering] Tige, aren't you gonna eat anything? There's Jell-O, with fruit cocktail. Great! Jell-O. I love Jell-O, you like Jell-O? Hmmm? [Mrs. Davis] We got some chocolate cake. [Tige] Nah. But you can wrap it in some aluminum foil for me. -I could take it home. -Home? -[Mrs. Davis] Sit down... -[Richard] No, I gotta... Yeah, what's the matter with him? I don't know. If you really wanna find out, why don't you ask him? Would you like some dessert? Some Jell-O? -Jell-O, yeah, I like Jell-O. -Very good. I'm a coward. I just didn't have the heart to tell him. [Richard] What the hell does that mean? It means I got here, it's your job to keep him here. Maybe it is, but will he let go as easy as you're doing? Easy? Are you kidding me? [Mrs. Davis] Excuse me. M, Marvin, did you call a cab? Yes, I guess I did. So, I hate to eat and run, but under the circumstances, I think it's... a good time to say good bye. I like you. Yeah, well, wait a minute. I-- Thank you, for the lovely meal. [Tige] Hey, Marv! Wait up, man, wait. Phew, move over. [panting] I can't go anywhere without you. I mean, I thought I could leave without saying good bye. What you talking about? I told you I was gonna do what I thought was best, didn't I? -But-- -[Marvin] Didn't I? Man, you said we come here and then we go, we go way home after that. [Marvin] Tige. You are home. This is where you belong. And this is where I want you to stay. -You people, don't like me-- -[Marvin] Hey, hey, c'mon! C'mon! Don't talk like that! You don't belong with me. Was nice while it lasted. I enjoyed your company, I was happy for it. But, there's so much more for you here. Look, look behind you, go on! Turn around and look behind you. Tige? Do me one favor. Just promise me you're gonna stay here. All right, look. I want to do this nicely, I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. But if you must know, I was tired of the whole setup. I'm sick of you. -Man, you lying. -[Marvin] Yeah? What if I'm not? You don't wanna stay here? That's fine with me. You just do what you want. Just don't come running back to me. I don't want you. Understand? I don't want you to come back to me. If you're stupid enough to louse this up, you go right ahead. Know what's good for you, stay put. Now, get outta here! Two forty-four, Alexander Street. Let's go, come on, let's go. Let's go. [chuckling] You look like you've seen a ghost or something. Hey, Marv. Hi, Tige. Did I scare you? Man, you sure scared me. [chuckling] I didn't know what you was, come busting through the door like that. No, I knew you were here. You sure made a mess, didn't you? [Tige laughing] So, how are you and your father getting along? Okay, I guess. What's the matter, you having trouble? Nah. Not that. I like him and all, you know? We have some good times together, sometimes. Like, like, he takes me to ball games. -Buts... -What? Yeah, it's just that, I don't get to see him that much. Have to go to school, he have to go to work. I don't even get to sleep with him at night, like I did with you. I guess I just like it, a one person instead of with a whole family. I kind alike it one on one, Marv. [Marvin] Yeah. -Marvin? -Yeah? You even miss me any? [Marvin] Oh... [Marvin chuckles] Course I do, why you ask? I don't know. Guess cause everything just seems so different. This place just don't seem the same no more. What about me? You? You seem different too. I know you the same... But you still seem different. I don't understand it. I think I know what it might be. It's like... Two ugly ducklings, living in a pond. One is really a duck, [chuckles] the other, a swan. now, what happens is... The ugly duckling, who's really a swan... one day leaves the pond. -You know that rhymes? -Yeah, I do. And, while he's away, he grows. He gets new feathers, he meets other swans... And he learns what it's like to be a swan. And then one day... He decides to go back and visit his old pal... -The old ugly duck... -[Tige chuckling] ...still living in the muddy pond. And, you know, with the same old ways. Now, you and I both know that a duck and a swan are not the same. But you can't deny there was something very strong there. And no matter what changes are taking place... there's a close bond, still felt by both of them. It is with me. What about you? That's cute, Marv. I was wondering if you could still do that. You know, like you used to. You know, explain things to me like that? You still with me, man. Don't you get lonely? Oh yeah, I suppose I do, sometimes. Don't you want no friends, though? Rejoin civilization, is that what you're saying to me? You want this fat, old duck to jump in the pond with you? Hmm, maybe someday I'll be a swan too, but... until then, you just have to accept me the way I am. Wait. Marv. I didn't mean nothing by it, just want you to be happy, man, that's all. Right now the only thing that's gonna make me happy, is to see the mug of yours smile. You need to shave. Getting fuzzy. I'll get around to it sooner or later. Have it by, have it done by, uh, Sunday, okay? Why Sunday? What's Sunday? A special occasion. It's my birthday. Your birthday? Oh! -Huh, 12 right? -[Tige] Yup! Think I'd never make it? Think I'd ever make it this far? But I did! Uh, hey, Marv? [Marvin] yeah? Will you laugh, if I tell you something, man? It depends on whether it's funny or not. Just something I... I thought I'd let you know, just in case you didn't. -Marvin? -[Marvin] Yes? I love you, man. I had to tell you. Cause I, I didn't get the chance to tell my mamma when she was living. I can't remember when I heard those words... Thank you for letting me know. I love you too. Well, I gotta go now. See ya later, Marv. Listen... Now, remember this. Ten o'clock on Sunday, right? Don't be late. Don't worry about no present. Okay? See you Sunday. Bye, Marv. See you.
