Its so hot. This is crazy! - What are you thinking of, you dirty rat? - Do you want to go to the bunker? - One of thems got away. - Rosa Phillips. Nothing. Not a trace of her. She must be somewhere around here. She cant just vanish. I dont believe it! I will find her. If you keep on shouting like that, Im sure you will. Carlos! Stop! Stop! No, Marquesa, you are not a goddess. I dont want an electric shock. No! I wont say anything. I swear I wont tell, as long as you spare me this. Have mercy. Please smile. No. No electric shock. Hello. This is Dr Arcos speaking. Put me through to the hospital, the surgical ward. Your long-distance call is unnecessary. Were taking the escaped prisoner into custody. The girl was lying in front of my house. She is badly injured. This internee killed a warden during her escape. - It must have been self-defence. - It doesnt matter what her reason was. - Well take her with us. - Shes been shot and cannot be moved. - Oh, cant she? - The bullet has to be removed immediately. Dont worry. This patient is hard-baked... and dangerous. She can survive far greater strain than this. Only I will decide whether or not an operation will be performed. - Dont tell me what... - Please send your bill to my office. - Put her on the stretcher. - My bill? I cant charge you for my sense of medical responsibility. Thats something you greatly overestimate. But we wont be stingy. - Can responsibility be overestimated? - I wouldnt be so stubborn. What does a run-of-the-mill doctor know about antisocial lunatics? Were in charge. A form, notifying me that Rosa Phillips died of a sepsis three days after my examination and that I should submit an invoice for my efforts. I went to the clinics administrative department. They paid me a fee that was bound to arouse my suspicion. When I asked them to release the body for autopsy, they refused. I decided not to let the matter rest. A prisoner cannot receive a death penalty for an escape attempt. How can it be possible that a doctor allows wardens to shoot at patients? If they think it is sufficient to say that they are deranged sex offenders whose treatment people like us dont understand, then we might as well approve of euthanasia. The fact that Rosa Phillips was so afraid of being treated by the clinics head physician that she even resisted it when delirious, together with her allegedly unexplained death, should alarm us. I asked if I could visit the clinic. They refused. My attempts at an investigation were obviously not welcome. Therefore I came to the decision that I should ask you to examine this case. Im asking for an official investigation by the Rosenthal Foundation, which has made a great contribution toward making the penal system more humane. Imprisonment as a means of revenge, sentences as cruel retaliation - these are inhumane measures. Dr Arcos, your remarks interest us because we have heard things about this institution before which pointed in the same direction. They werent as grave, but still serious. Thats why I asked the ministry to initiate an investigation a month ago. They denied the request, saying that the Rosenthal Foundation wasnt responsible. They also said that these suspicions were pure fiction and that the Las Palomas clinic was subject to strict state controls. I had to give up since we couldnt name a witness. And all we have in Dr Arcos case is the testimony of a disturbed, delirious prisoner. I have no doubt that the minister of justice would refuse another request. Until the Rosenthal Foundation can identify a credible witness whose testimony is based on personal experience, we wont get any further. - We wont get any further. - Where do you intend to find a witness? It wont be possible to get a witness out of that snake pit alive. - Dont move, Dr Arcos, or Ill shoot. - What do you want? With your help, I want to make something happen that means a lot to me. - And whats that? - I reckon youre clever enough to be able to smuggle a patient into the Las Palomas clinic. - Who are we talking about? - Me. I need to get in there. - But thats completely crazy. - Thats my problem. Why on earth do you need to go there? I have to find out what happened to Rosa Phillips. You have to think of a way to smuggle me into that funny farm. After eight to ten weeks, get me out of there with some clever ploy. Ill tell you everything you want to know. That way, youII get your credible witness without risking anything. - Are you sure you want to do this? - Yes. - You knew Rosa Phillips. - Yes, I did. You must have liked her very much. Youre risking a lot. Rosa is my sister. Im sure she was careless, but Im also sure that she wasnt a criminal. Watch out, someones coming. You certainly are brave. Thats enough. Put that thing away. Ill smuggle you in, if I can. Lets give it a try. There you are. A tramp with a lovely obsessional neurosis. - This report is for the administration. - All right. - And remember, dont talk too much. - I wont. - Your name is... - Abelina Garcia. - You were born in... - San Angeli. - Age? -24. - Married? - No, Im single. - Your former occupation? - Elementary school teacher. For a teacher, your criminal record is remarkable. - I hope you know it all by heart. - I can rattle it off in my sleep. Apart from you and me, nobody knows that youre the reporter Abbie Phillips, who is perfectly sane. You know what youre getting yourself into? Yes, I think I do. Ill come and get you after eight weeks. This is Dr Arcos. I need a car to take a patient to the Las Palomas clinic. Your first time? Now tell me, any previous convictions? And where were you born, madam? In San Angeli. lye been here for three years. - All right, youve got to sign this. - OK. - Avanti, the next ward. - Presto, presto, you lame duck. - What do you want? - Im helping you get your kit off. Id rather get undressed by myself. Stop wittering! You can forget your independence now. No more airs and graces. - Look, Berta, flat tits and a flat bum. - But shes boasting like a busty film star. All right, dolly, youre going to get a little wet now. - With this jet, well get off all the dirt. - It will scare away the crab lice. They have an insurmountable aversion to chlorinated water. - It wont do your little curls any good. - Theyll fall off and youll be bald as a coot. - Turn around. - And your bum is as red as a baboons. - Catch, doggy. - Youve whimpered enough. There you go. Enough wiping. - Can I have my panties back? - Im afraid thats against the rules. - We like them bare. - Yes, but I cant... - Youll be surprised at what you can do. - Look at the number on your shirt. Thats you from now on. Go on, read it! - Shes illiterate. -41. Thats what weve christened you. Its your number. I advise you not to forget it. If I ever hear your name again, Ill knock your forgetfulness out of you. The number 41 will be stamped upon your breast so you will never forget it again. Do you understand that you will be called Number 41 from now on? Everybody grovels at your feet, Marquesa. I adore you. Madre de Dios, these damned stitches! You are the sun that illuminates my life. You are the candle, I am the wick. You are the womb. Let me in. Not a single guy, not a single shred of a man, only women, females... - This bloody thread! - Quit your knitting and cursing, will you? You are Allah. I herald you. If you even remember how to do anything else. Your knitting is no use to anyone. - Shut up. - And youre no use either. Youre half male. - How are you, Joconda? Are you better? - Im fed up with crying all the time. - Have you dropped the stitches again? - Ill never finish this jumper. To hell with it! Never mind. Watch out, the bullies. With us, you act the big shot, but when they come, youre quiet. The second bed on the right is yours, but youII be in trouble if I find a single crease in the sheet. What a fine lady has come to join us! - Dont you fool around with the new one. - Ill handle her with kid gloves. Shes a feminist. She discusses everything with the group. - Whats your name? Im Juana. - Im Number 41. These are just Chubby Cheeks and Iron Gretas little games. - So, whats your name? -41. - Are you a swot or something? - Why not? I know your sort. Were just objects for you to study. Who sets the tone here? - I dont know. - Then these girls will show you, you moron. Juana is our spokeswoman. She talks until your ears rot. And how she plays the piano! Shes the greatest, the best, the very greatest! - Right, now youve heard it. - Yes, you crack the whip over us. Look at this, shes got proper nuclear warheads! - Her skin is like its made of ice. - What a cute triangle! - And theres not a single man to screw her. - Please dont. - Why? - Youre new. Were like guys in that respect. It always turns us on enormously. You have such cute, hard breasts - like a boy. Thats enough. What a pity. What a shame. Youre the only one not taking part? Why do you offerthem something you refuse yourself? Because I choose the objects of my erotic fancies according to my own taste. I hope thats clear too. I am your prophet. You are the beautiful one, the sublime one... - Shit! - Ill sew the button back on for you, but first Ill show you Frankenstein. If they catch you without a button, its solitary confinement for you. Theyll prick your bottom. And that hurts. - Thanks. - No problem. - No cocks... - Shall I show you Bunny? Go on, then. Ill give you some advice. Dont tell them your name, even if that one there presses you. She sets this trap for every new girl. If you fall for it, youre finished. Theyll burn your number into your skin. I was stupid. - Oh my God. - Look, shes showing her boob again. Come on in. Why are you so late? They only just called me. Avanti. You know what youre supposed to do. And now you will give me a massage. Wonderful. Youre fantastic. - What do you think of the new one? - Not bad but I think shes a fake. Is she going to stay in my dorm? Dont you find this question a little too impudent? What have my decisions got to do with you? Nothing. You can do anything you like with her - and with me. Good girl. You know, there are creatures that were made for pleasure. You and I are obviously two of them. - But this new girl... - seems to be made for suffering. If only you didnt try to be clever all the time. - Thats enough. Stop it. - Yes, Marquesa. Yes, thats good. Beautiful. Were going to have a ball in a minute. Yes... Acupuncture is a completely unexplored field of activity for me. And you...you are such an excellent object. Its true, you are terribly brave, my angel. But you will scream anyway, believe me. Well... And now... Well, one has to suffer a few unpleasant things, if one wants to have the pleasant ones. Because every once in a while life should be fun, my darling, my little angel. Pleasure and pain, an eternal cycle. A naked body is...sacred. Everything you are experiencing here you are experiencing of your own free will. Yes, absolutely. - I can do to you whatever I want. - Yes. Yes. Only the scream will release you from your fears. The scream is the final release from neurosis. So scream. Roar like a bull. Scream. Scream. Im releasing you from it. I am. - Hey, are you still awake? - As you can see, I am. Come on, 41, lets smoke a peace pipe together. - Dont worry. Theres no marijuana in it. - Isnt there? No, I dont do drugs. They make you feel so awful afterwards. Its as plain as the nose on your face. Drugs stir up all the shit you repress. - Thanks. - Youre welcome. Well, were two of those people who are in a real mess. Its hard to pull yourself out of a mess by your own hair. Yes, it is. And if, like me, youre neither woman nor man... Thats my problem, you see. Yes, its a real dilemma. I always fall between two stools, even if I come across as a genuine woman. And I feel just like a woman these days. - You dont believe me, do you? - Yes, I do. I believe it all. I havent always been a woman. The doctors have transformed me. Yes, they cutoff my little willy. The professors keep my severed little giant and testicles in a jar - my so-called past as a man. And why did you have the operation? You seem to fancy women. I always fancy what I cant have. When I was still a bloke, I always ran after the boys. I had a sex change because I was keen to get married. I married the next best man and was rather disappointed when I learnt that he was gay. So I took a knife and castrated him. I ended up in prison, of course. It was there that I realised how messed up I was. Im a bloody tranny. And now lye got to hang around with these tucked-up women. - I cant stand them. - Cant you? But I can stand men even less. After all, women are warmer and more tender. As a man, you tremble. Youre forever scared of being impotent. Its dreadful. I know what Im talking about. I really do. - Tell me your name. - 14. But you can address me by my nickname-]. Yes. And now Ill let you sleep, my dear 41, so you dont lose your nerve when they put you through your paces tomorrow. - Who? - Well, Greta and Chubby Cheek. The Iron Lady and her gorilla. Marquesa del Pino and Paolo Rego. But only shes the boss. She is rumoured to have had an affair with a minister. What does she look like? She has goggle eyes as big as soup bowls. And her bosom - God, its like a truck full of jelly wobbling around the corner. If only Pino wasnt completely bonkers. Shes so sexy. - Name? -41. Well done, but right now wed like your birth name, please. Just this once, youre allowed to say it. I grant you official permission. - Abelina Garcia. - Please talk. You have my permission. - Why do you think youre here? - Because I... I suffer from a compulsive disorder. You were a teacher in some one-horse town, werent you? Yes, but I wasnt ill then. - You liked touching the sweet little boys. - Thats not true. Oh, darling, you really shouldnt get worked up. Im sorry. Please remember, you can be perfectly honest with us. We can only help if we know about your problems. Were not your judges. Were doctors, virtually the same as pastors. Your illness is in no way insurmountable, and Im sure well cure you. Youre clever, cultured... Your good sense... Thats all I need to say. At first, I resisted it. Thats why I left the school. From then on, I just wandered about. Its easy for me to talk the boys round. I promise them wild adventures. I tell them how good I am in bed, drink with them, teach them how to steal. They learn all the bad things from me. Im not sure if youre being entirely honest. How old are the children? Theyre over 16, but I corrupt their morals. 1.1 cant help it. I have a real fixation about it. They run after me as if they were addicted. And I run after them and make them more and more dependent on me. What do you inject them with? No, no, not what you think. I dont mean that kind of addiction. It has nothing to do with drugs or anything like that. Whatever it has to do with and whether its the truth or not - eventually, even the biggest web of lies turns into a confession. And Im confident that well manage to penetrate your innermost self very soon. Youve nicked my jumper again, you old maid. - Let me refresh your memory. - Get lost. - Youre a complete flutter. - Whos that in the wheelchair? No idea. Sometimes, people turn up that youve never seen before. And no one knows who they are? No. They often wheel people across the yard, and then they disappear again. But where are they? There are so many of those. We arent introduced. Sometimes they disappear overnight. - And no one asks what happened to them? - Not unless youre weary of life. Stop it! Do you think I like hearing this bitch jerk off that idiot in the garden all the time? - I wont have it. - Get stuffed. id like to know something about a girl who used to be here. lsnt she here any more? No, I dont think she is. I dont think shes still alive. - Do you at least know her number? - No, I dont. - How long ago was that? - One year. I wasnt here then. You should ask Juana. She pokes her nose into everything. Shes the only one who might be able to help you. Do you see my marble body? - Make sure you dont lose any ornaments. - Dont worry. Hey, soap my back. After that you can scrub my bum. Go on. Are you deaf or something? Hurry up, scrub me. - Im just well-built. - At last. Who would have thought? This kitten has real velvet paws. Does she? And now the bum. Hey, is that supposed to be it, you pig? Is this what you call giving someone a wash? Carry on. Yes, thats better. Thats just the job. OK, thats enough soaping. Now do the job properly. Oh, one is making a fuss! One is far too posh for this. Didnt you hear me? Stick it in! Dont worry, your finger wont break off. It seems to me that you never used to wash at home. Carry on. Thats it. You will pick up the soap and continue until I tell you to piss off. - No. - Just a second. - Eat the soap, or youre in for it! - Let go of me at once! Ill show you whats what! “Toreador, on guard! And remember, yes, remember as you fight “that two dark eyes are watching you.” Lets have a party! Beat her up good and proper! Stop it! Go for her! Lets go! Quiet! Bloody rift-raft. The new one, of course. Let go of her, you bitch. - Be reasonable, Juana. - Just you wait! Going on the rampage! Ill take you where you can scream until you expire. - Let go of me. - Nothings going to happen to you. Ill give that cow a real bawling-out. Shell soon be grateful if I let her lick my feet or wipe my bum. - Ill show her! - Shut up now! Fancy solitary confinement? At last youre coming round, my child. They thought the angry warden might have hit you too hard. Hit me? Why hit me? I dont know what... Thats really bad. Shes forgotten all about her misdirected initiative. This rebelliousness is always the result of a deeply rooted aggressive impulse. I cant bear the headache. Im sure it will pass, wont it, Paolo? Paolo? Why am I here? Those who are prone to violence disturb the other patients with their behaviour. Theyre very sensitive, and Im afraid thats why... ..weve had to separate you from them. And then... It looks as if youre still dominated by sex. Well, poor child, well gain control of that. Well definitely cure you of that. If only the headache wasnt so terrible. How its pounding. It hurts so much. - I cant even see properly. - Thats just because youre so sensitive. No. No. Im afraid I will have to hurt you even more now. No. No, dont. No! I think this will soothe your troubles below the waistline. Right, and now something to soothe the highly sensitive nerves in your head. A specific shock therapy. Rego? Thatli do. Take the patient to the relaxation cell. And then tell Number 10 that Im expecting her. Hello? Im in the cell next to yours. The pipes go through all the cells. Im tall enough to reach them. We can communicate through the pipes. You have to speak into the filter somewhere in the lower pipe. If you cant reach it, you must try to answer by knocking. I hope you can at least reach the pipe with your hand. Ill ask questions, and youll knock the answers. One knock means yes, two knocks means no. Got that? Knock. Go on, do it. Stand on tiptoe. Are you feeling as bad as me? Have you just got here? lye been in this heavenly place for over three months. I know every rat here. Theyve fallen in love with me. Occasionally, the bullies get me out and torture me for a while, just for fun. They want me to sing, but I wont. Im not soft in the head. Even if the Marquesa claims that I was. My name is Laura Gomarra. They conduct experiments with chemicals, to see whos the most resistant. Cora Alvarez is lying in the cell to your right. She cant walk any more. Theres about 14 of us down here. I think were all on the way out. I was immune to their infections at first. Im stronger than you white girls after all. But Im sure theyll come up with a few special surprises for me. Paola Gabol and Rosa Phillips are on their last legs as well. They cant even knock any more. I wonder what else is in store for me. Perhaps theyre going to have a big party with me. Hey, are you even listening to me? - Señor. - Thank you. - Waiter! - Yes, señor? - The drinks are on me. - Thanks. One rum, please. Certainly. Ah, a whole cartload this time. Look at that. Terrific. - I hope the quality is the same as always. - It is. Cheerio. Were you happy with the films we gave you? Yes, they were quite good. But eventually theyll need some variety. - Us men shouldnt be left out completely. - I see. OK. - Great. - Okey-dokey. Quite a nice sum. - Theres nothing wrong with money. - When will we meet again, señor? Ill see our boss tomorrow and give the material to the print lab. id say in two weeks. I think business will flourish from now on. Raciness is always in demand. Youre as pale as a corpse on holiday. What on earth have they done to you? - Have they cauterised you down there? - Yes, with some sort of chemicals. Its burning. Come on, love, clench your teeth and try to sleep, so you regain your strength. Those bastards. The one over there is covered in weals. But she doesnt mind. Shes a masochist. Torture turns her on. She needs it. Its an obsession of hers. Part of her is a real beast, but at the same time shes ever so obedient. - Has she been back for a long time? - Yes. She wasnt in solitary confinement. - She was only away the first night. - Where can she have been? With Iron Greta. Shes said to tuck her until they almost drop dead. And while theyre doing it, that sneak tells her about us. The dirty snitch. Then perhaps Juana could tell me if theres another girl here. - I mean in the bunker. - Im sure she could. - You think so? - She does what she wants. She talks to almost everyone. Whats her name? Rosa Phillips. If shes still here, she can only be down there. I must find out. Thats why Im here. - ltd be crazy if we didnt find that out. - Do you think so? What an opportunity! Perhaps you could ask Number 10 about it, but not too directly. - If you go about it in a clever way... - No, shes too beastly. Shell smell a rat. But it doesnt matter. Id do anything for you. Youre fantastic. Youre kind and tender. You? Come in. Any news? You can go. - Cigarette? - Yes, please. - So you have news. - Plenty of news. All right, what is it? Many interesting things, but I have a question first. So ask me. Will you still be so hard-hearted with the new one, the poor idiot? Whats with the sympathy? Im sure you punished her so severely because of me. Youre touching. Shes defiant. I would have punished her anyway. Its got nothing to do with you. Do you have some kind of conscience all of a sudden? Why else would your heart break out of sympathy for her? You hypocrite. But I promise you to be gentle with her anyway. So, lets hear the news. Im curious. OK. Number 14, the transsexual, asked me a few questions on behalf of the new one. The two little lambs are thick as thieves now. And what kind of questions did she ask? About a girl who had been here. And she wanted to know if Rosa Phillips is still alive - possibly in the cellar. - Thats what this Abbie wants to know? - Thats what Number 14 said, anyway. - They really are naive. - Is Rosa Phillips still here? Yes, she is indeed. And shes in the cellar? I dont envy her. I wouldnt like to be her. Continue. - What else do you know? - Thats enough. Its enough that Number 41 is trying to find out if Rosa Phillips is still alive. In my opinion, theres something fishy about this. We must find out if the new girl has any accomplices. With her, its like banging your head against a brick wall. Perhaps not. You have to make her believe that she can trust you. Im sure shell tell you more than you want to know. - OK, but Ill only do it if you let her live. - That can be arranged. Why not? First, Ill tell her that Rosa is still alive and that shell see her. That might not be a bad idea. - But first Ill have some fun with her. - If you must, you must. No! This constant whimpering! Show some consideration for the others! Hey, Im in here. Come here, you beast! Come to me. Paolo. Ill snog you until you run out of breath, until your tongues hanging out. So that you finally croak it, you old witch. Ill tear off your sagging breasts and feed them to the pigs. - Come on, then. - I dont have to be told twice. Do you think Im scared of you, you dirty bitch? Eight days hard detention. Paolo! Im delighted to see you. Persistent liars have all my sympathy. Set it to level three. You know a girl called Abelina, or rather Abbie. - Think. Abbie. Abbie Garcia. - Abbie? - Abbie? - Listen, theres no point in denying it. Abbie is in our power. And if you dont talk now, if you dont confess that shes the head of your conspiracy, well have to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. And then Abbie will meet the same fate that we were forced to impose on you. Well have to use the same methods we used with you, and youII have to watch. Dont do this to her. Please dont. Please. Yes, you must be very scared of her, or you would hardly be playing the great heroine for her sake, would you? Would you? Oh, Im surprised it didnt occur to me before - shes obviously your lover. - No. - What? Abbie... is my sister. Please dont harm her...my sister. I promise I will be very, very kind and good to her, if you give me a few names. - Names? - Yes, the names of your cronies. I dont know any names, not a single one. I dont know any, not a single one. I dont have any cronies. - So youre remaining stubborn. - No. The name of the boss of your organisation will do. Just one single name. If you give me one name, Ill be happy. And your sister will be free, I swear. Level four. Perhaps you know the name now? Think about it. There was someone there when you escaped, wasnt there? What was his name again? He wasnt very likeable. He insisted you have surgery, against my will. But you got on with him very well. He seemed to be a confidant of yours. Its really unforgivable that I forgot about this guy. Its him. - No, its not him. - This guy... Dr Arcos? Yes, he was my friend, my confidant. See, now youve given me his name. Given you the name? No, youre wrong. - Dad? - Yes. - Where are you? - Down here. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? - Yes. - Im going to town. - Can you take this letter? - It has to be sent recorded delivery. - Sure, Ill do that, Daddy. - There you go, child. - Rosenthal Foundation. Are you in trouble? - No, darling. - All right, then. See you later. - See you later. - Do you want me to buy you anything? - No, thanks. - Bye. Strange. - At last. - What do you want, gentlemen? Oh, youre ready to leave. Where are you going? This belongs to my daughter. Shes moving into town. - Would you please tell me what you want? - What a nice little story! Well, that was short and sweet. Put the body in the water. - Weve silenced him for good. - About time as well. Here we are. I have an upset stomach but you can come in anyway. Number 14 told me you wanted to see me. Yes, my angel, I have very interesting news, but first you have something to make up to me. So you really found out something about the girl. I find out whatever I want to find out. Its a shame we dont get on, sweetheart. I know, you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours. Ill do anything you want, if you forgive me. Sentimentalities wont get you anywhere. I want proof. Kneel down. Juana! First of all, you will lick my boot. Lick it! OK, now lick the other one. You had an extreme aversion to cleanliness the other day. Thats changed, hasnt it? No excuses. Get on with it! - Stop. And now... - Yes? Youve done such a good job that it must be cleaner than my boots now. Avanti. See, my angel, youre not that clumsy at all. Its going really well. Youre in good shape today. Youre really coming along well. So it still makes her sick after all. Listen, I can arrange for you to meet Rosa Phillips. Ill get the keys to the solitary ward. You were right. She is alive. You will get to see her soon. - Will I? - And then well be even. Stop crying. Theres no point. Shes not that bad, really. If you think about it, shes helping you. Everybody does what they can, and this is her way of helping. - Darling. - Youre a fabulous woman. You know it, but I have to keep telling you. Everything about you is terribly exciting. Your legs are like ropes that pull me towards you. Your laughter sounds like the song of a huge swarm of mosquitoes. - When your eyes narrow... - Like now. - ..theyre like glowing coals in a snowball. - Youre almost a poet. - No, only a harassed statesman. - Perhaps during the day. Now youre mine. - What can I do for you? - Make me feel like a woman. When I see you in front of me, Im so spellbound by your body that I cant believe that there are moments when youre not feeling like a woman. Can you forgive me just once more, my goddess? - There you are. - Thank you. Youre wonderful. Your breasts are as magnificent as the fireworks of a great night. - Come. You may come. - Yes. - Ill do anything for you. Anything. - And if I take you at your word? - Why dont you? - I will. - Im coming. - How wonderful. Have you made any progress regarding Abbie Garcia? - Her name is Phillips, not Garcia. - Phillips? Did you know that youre the only one who cares about my worries? As a matter of fact, I didnt know that, but thank you very much. And dont forget - your worries are my worries. One of the girls has told tales out of school, and it turned out that shes Abbies sister. The bitch was going to plot against us. Its just fantastic how you manage to make these obstinate devils talk. How do you do it? How do you achieve it? With very special methods. Im allowed to have a little secret too, arent I? - Yes, but isnt it... - Dangerous? No. Have you found out if those two have any accomplices? Yes, they have one, a certain Dr Arcos. - Arcos? - Yes, my little scaredy-cat. The man should disappear before he can do any damage. I dont know how that could be arranged. - The disappearing bit was your idea. - Yes. Darling, what would you say if I told you that this source of irritation has disappeared already? - That youre merciless. - I had to be. I had to torture the girls. - Or they would never have confessed. - I admire you. - I always torture them. - How? - Until they scream out loud. - Youre divine. Tell me more. What happens then? What happens then? - Here you are. This is what we found. - Is that all? We searched Arcos house from the cellar to the attic. This is all there was. Put it with the private files. Is everything prepared for tonight? - Well? - I personally chose the stallions in prison. - Eight fine specimens. - Good. We might get another three or four from the bunker. We promised our clients exquisite material. - But little Linda remains reserved for me. - Why not? But then shed have to disappear into the bunker soon, or she might talk. That would be a shame. I like her so much. In solitary confinement, it would be much easier for us to see her. She would always be available. I reckon there will soon be three or four vacant cells in the bunker. Its highly likely. Those guys look like killers to me. - And Abbie? - With Juanas help, well make her happy. Well arrange a meeting that will surprise her. Dont be so prissy. Presto, presto. Avanti, avanti. All right, all right. - Today youll get something for the heart. - Getting restless, are you? Quiet, please. Our invitation is the result of our efforts to make confinement easier to bear for long-term prisoners. This innovation is due to a revision of state laws. The responsible minister has even gone so far as to consider abolishing segregation of the sexes in prisons. However, such a drastic measure cannot be taken overnight, because, in practice, it means sexual intercourse between prisoners, even cohabitation with a partner of your own choice - and the encouragement of initiative. - Oh, boy! Thus, we have agreed that we should put the idea to the test first. You are being presented with the chance to perform your wildest fantasies. This is a moment of liberty. Make the most of it. With the approval of the state! Stop bleating or Ill give you something to remind you of me. I prefer your boss tits, but I take what I can get. - Let go of me! Show me some mercy! - Thats what Im doing. How did you get hold of the key, Juana? Remember once and for all, I get everything I want. I could even start a revolt, but I dont know why I should bother. Youre all too stupid. Rosa! Oh my God. Rosa. What have they done to you? She doesnt recognise me. Rosa, we wont give up. Ill help you. Do you hear me? Ill help you. - Why dont you say something? - Hurry up, I want to get out of here. - No. - I knew it wouldnt be fun down here, but I didnt know it would go this far. Thats enough now. I want to get out of here. Oh, what a sweet, idyllic family scene. Thats it. You murderers! What have you done to my poor sister? - Number 10, leave the room. - Not until I know what youre going to do. Theres no reason why I should tell you. You have completed your task, you can go. Please remember that her life was guaranteed to me. You dirty snitch, who would guarantee you a life? Get lost, or youll end up like her. Ill make you pay for that. Were going upstairs now to find out the truth about the Phillips sisters. Isnt that true, Abbie? You were admitted to this clinic with forged papers. - You were going to spy for Dr Arcos. - No. You and your idiotic sister. The girls been lucky. If youre as stubborn as her, you wont leave this room alive. I dont think so. When Dr Arcos comes to get me out of here next week, he and his companions will ask where I am. And he will get me out of here. Your loyal friend wont be able to come. He cant. He died the day before yesterday. - Died? - It was necessary. Youre Abel ma Garcia, a patient with an obsessional neurosis. Who will believe her? Youre in my power. And before its time for you to die, I want the names of your accomplices. I dont have any. There is no conspiracy. How can I prove it to you? Even if you strike me dead, I dont know anything. - Nothing? - Nothing at all. I cant give you names that I dont know. You will give them to me. You will do it. Do you want to bet? Because if you dont, your guts will be flushed down the drain. Which is what we will now prepare you for. Take off your coat. Take off the coat! - Faster. - Please, Marquesa. Dont worry. Im going to have some fun with your sister first. - No. - Yes, I will. Shes for it. Spare Rosa. Please. Please! - You must love this lying bitch very much. - Take me instead. Shes suffered enough. She doesnt know anything. That is precisely her problem. And we have to eradicate it once and for all. No, please, ask of me whatever you want, but dont harm her. I will ask something of you, dont worry. - Ah, just on time, as usual. Hello, sir. - Hello, señor. - Here are the racy films I promised. - Thank you. We took many of your suggestions into account when we made the films. Thats great. 30 reels. OK. The last material was superb, by the way. If business keeps going this well... I am sure that this will surpass your expectations. - Well see. - Certainly. 10,000. - 50,000. Please check. - Not necessary between gentlemen. By the way, money wont be an issue, if you comply with a special request. And what is that? Were very flexible. OK, imagine a murder - Im not talking about a simulated one, but a real one. A dying scene - violent and highly erotic, a cannibalistic apocalypse, in which a sex-obsessed woman is the victim. - Something thats never been done before? - Exactly. But the murder really has to be committed. We want something absolutely realistic. This is your chance to make $100,000. For Christs sake, I cant get it into the hole. No cock. A little willys not yet a proper cock... Now lye got you. Shit! it will grow. - The hole is always too small. - Oh, stop it, will you? You dont want my help anyway. Its a pity. No, I prefer to do it to myself. with the mouth and with the hand for the fatherland... - Come here for a second. - Damn! - Interesting. - Are there any men down there? Guys! And just look at the trousers theyre wearing. Wow, what a fancy car! Look whos getting out of it. His chest is covered in medals. Who on earth can that be? I have no idea, but I could imagine that it will get embarrassing for the Marquesa. Stand in line, everybody. Hurry up. Chop-chop. I dont want any of you to say a word. I expect exemplary behaviour. YouII be quiet. Woe betide anyone who tries to talk bullshit. - Who are they? - Its an inspection. Be prepared. I dont believe for one second that they will do anything. Professor Rosenthal and Amnesty International have requested an inspection of this clinic. The government has granted their request. It is suspected that the methods that are employed in this clinic are out-of-date. The government was also asked to release a patient. Of course we are at your service. We have nothing to hide. Im sure that a thorough inspection of this clinic will dispel Professor Rosenthals unsubstantiated suspicions. Whats the name of the prisoner whose release is requested? - Abbie Phillips. - Abbie Phillips? I dont recall having a patient of that name. She was admitted to your clinic under the name of Abelina Garcia eight weeks ago. Garcia? Señor Rego, go and get me Abelina Garcias file, please. - So this patient is here under a pseudonym. - Yes. I see, Abelina was admitted at the instigation of Dr Arcos. I know. He wrote it to me on the day he was murdered. As far as we know, a terrorist organisation is responsible for the unexplained death of Dr Arcos. So many esteemed people are assassinated. I feel very sorry for him. lye had quite a lot of contact with Dr Arcos lately. He had entrusted Abelina to me. Shes a patient that means a lot to me. Such a lovely, helpless thing. But if the government has granted the request, I will of course hand her over. Señor Rego, please arrange everything for the handing over of Number 41. And now, gentlemen, I would like you to tell me if you intend to inspect the clinic with or without me. Attention, everybody! Stand up to welcome visitors. - What are you waiting for? - You too, at the back. Thats better. And now...smile. - And these are the dormitories. - I see. Good morning. - Say hello to the gentlemen, dear children. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good girls. Good morning, good morning, good morning. I wonder what led to these defamations. Im glad we complied with the gentlemens request. A clinic like yours deserves support. Thank you for your praise and for your visit. Bring the patient to me. As you can see, its a very tragic case. Its got all the characteristics of an acute episode of her catatonic schizophrenia. - A hopeless case. - We shall examine that. - Professor. - Marquesa. Goodbye. Dear Professor Rosenthal, Your Excellencies, I am Greta del Pino. If you think that you can catch on to me, then you have a lot to learn, gentlemen. I rule here. I have command over life and death. All that counts here is my orders, and nothing but my orders. Nothing. You, Juana? What do you want? Why did you come in without knocking? - I want to tell you something. - Fine. Shut the door. All right then, dont. Whats the matter? Come on, out with it. Dont keep me in suspense. - Well? - Were going to miss your winsome nature. - Were going to miss your friendly smile. - But... Get out! Buzz off! Are you completely crazy? Get out! Buzz off! Go on. - No. - My God, the pennys dropped. - No. - Get her! - Its all over. - Well destroy you. - This is the reckoning. - Well send you to the hell you sent us to. An electric shock, but ten times as powerful. Help! Rego! Help!
