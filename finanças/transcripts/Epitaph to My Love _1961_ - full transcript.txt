Come again. ... today at noon a woman jumped in the sea at Pier No.2 in Yokohama and drowned. The unidentified woman was around 20 years old. She was wearing a flower pattern blouse and a green skirt. She was floating face down in the water the Yokohama police... It's depressing eh? Please... that news. It is raining in Kanagawa now. It will continue until this evening. It will stop around sunrise and the weather will improve. The high wave warning has not been cancelled. Ships passing offshore should use caution. Rain stopped yet? That ends the news. You are listening to radio Kanto J-O-R-A. At the tone it will be 10 PM. Thank you. Taxi... Yokahama Citizens' Hospital? - Sure. You got it. Where were you looking? - Asshole! Why weren't you paying attention? What... it's your fault. Why are you complaining? This mark is strange. What about my compensation? You can't get off scot-free. This afternoon, at pier No.2 a young woman drowned herself. She was floating face down. Perhaps already dead. But was it Chie AZUMA or not. I can't figure it out. No, that Chie drowned herself... I can't believe it. Chie would never do something like that. This rain is strong. That day was very sunny. That day... right... That was the first day I wore the Press Club badge... that day. Please write to me. I can't promise to write. - Don't be such a hard ass. So then finally, the most likely drug route... is via the 'Kobe Maru' crew and the Nagata group? You... got the inside story, eh? You'll soon be a famous writer. Please, help me out Izaki-san... Izaki-san...! This dick doesn't accept our story. - Hard nut, isn't he? No, no... we're just getting started. But, seems he wants to steer clear of us. Don't let it bother you. If he's uptight, we'll have to push him. Is it possible... to do that? Ishibashi... the trick to this job... first push, second push, third push... In short, getting the story's just like getting a girl. - Really? Really? Aren't you interested in women? - Not interested. You're a sad case. Keep getting rejected? - Not like that. I don't wan't the hassle any more. - Ohhh? Already had a good one? So tell me, lover-boy... an older woman? YOKOHAMA TIMES EDITOR (Sign on door) Where is reception? - Reception? I want to see someone. Oh, meet someone? Who's that? Mr. Kiyoshi Ishibashi. - You mean the new guy, right? Has Mr. Ishibashi come back yet? - Not yet. Mr. Ishibashi... She's calling you. It's okay. Go on. It's okay. Forget her. - My, don't say that. Be at 'Red Seal Ship' by three o'clock. - What's the 'Red Seal Ship'? My good friend's coffee shop. Where is it? Dummy... A reporter asking the way somewhere. Figure it out yourself. Are you commuting from Tokyo? I've realized that this is my life's work. So... I've settled on this. Really. I've been thinking I want to forget those days. You make enough to live on now so you're dumping me. No, not like that. So what now? I can't live like that forever. Somehow, I want to be independent. Who are you playing with? You were playing around a lot before. Will only 12,000 be enough? Well... I don't know. But.. even so I won't die. It's okay... I can always come to see you. No... we agreed to stop seeing each other. Not quite... I haven't given up on you yet. And how's your husband doing? Kiyoshi-san... RED SEAL SHIP (17th century, Red Seal denoted Ieyasu's protection. Deterred pirates.) You won't get married. Don't worry. Show me. But this is very strange. You'll have three children. Welcome. Come, I'll introduce you. The man joining us is ISHIBASHI Kiyoshi. He's still a bachelor. Pleased to meet you. What's up? Bring him a coffee. Ishibashi... you reek of bachelorhood. Must be your maternal instinct waking up. Why not become his girlfriend. - Thanks, but no. I don't like men with smelly socks. Are they that bad? Would you like me to wash your socks. No... socks always smell. Hear... your coffee. - Thanks. What's your name? Cleopatra. I'm NOZOSAWA Akio. And this is NATSUKI Aiko. You? AZUMA Chie. This, please. AZUMA Rikie (House sign) That you Chie? Is it night already? You haven't eaten have you? - Nah. The factory? I didn't go. - That's not good. It's not 'not good'. Chie... Today... on the 6th and the 4th I lost 600 yen. If you went to the print factory you would have made 600 yen. You should let your father have some fun sometimes. My whole life's a struggle. Father... you pawned the black umberella? I borrowed that from a shop. Is that so? What's, "Is that so?" How will I return it now? But the rice shop... They came to collect our tab. What could I do? Ya-chan... when the launch comes, don't let it go. - Right. Is that alright? It's a woman... she's well known in Macau. She looks like a tabacco shop auntie. It's starting to get windy. Can we get to press by 10? - Should be able to. It's a big story. When I get home tonight... I'll have tea-rice and a glass of sake with my wife. I'll go to the bath house and then wash my clothes. Your smelly socks too. Should be great fun. Ah, what was that woman's name? Ah, you mean AZUMA Chie. - Ah, that's right. Idiot... don't light it. RED SEAL SHIP COFFEE SHOP Are you disapointed? She took leave today. No... I didn't come to see her. Oh is that so? - Coffee. Seems Ishibashi-san's suffering from love fever. Let see? - Not like that. It's just that I noticed she wasn't here today. That's fine then. Chie-chan has someone good. She looks rather shy... actually she's quite the girl. He's the son of the big cheese at Kimura Corp. A bit handsome... he brings presents and such for Chie... but she's gives him the cold shoulder. She acts indifferent, but you never know. What? Yah... Oh that article... yah that's right. There were two reporters, SUDA Shinji and ISHIBASHI Kiyoshi. Huh... he's not here right now... Hey, you... where is Ishibashi. Probably at Red Seal Ship. Said he was going for coffee. Yes... I'll find him. It's ours. Suda-san... you look happy. Something good is it? None of your business. - What a bore. Hello... Aiko there? It's me. Suda-san talking. Is Ishibashi there? Hi... figured you'd be there. - Since I had nothing on... That's just it... you do. The Editor-in-Chief invited us for dinner. For our unflagging efforts on that article. That article...? - The drug trafficing story. Probably a bonus. - Me too? - Sure. Is it true? If that's the case it'll rain tomorrow. Where're you off to? To see a film. Your day off? - I'm on the late shift. Going alone to such an early film... Which would it be? "Strangers When We Meet" (1960 Kirk Douglas, Kim Novak) Shall I accompany you to the theater? No umbrella though. I like walking in the rain. You're rather willful. You always see films on your own? Your lucky. If I say I want to go to a film, there's someone right there to take me. But I don't want to go with him. Well, this is it. - Good bye. If I think now... from behind she looked so miserable. Seeing her from behind... why didn't I realize... what a heavy burden she was carrying. Chie... didn't look back that time either. I was willing her to look back. And if she had... I would have confessed my feelings to her. Which... I did that night in Yamashita Park. Home? Where? - Near Gumio-ji. Right. Strange, eh. When we walk like this people might think us lovers. You... don't have any women friends? I have. I had so many in Tokyo that I got fed up and chucked them all. Must be rich. What about you? A 'boyfriend'. No one like that. Instead... there's a man who wants to give me money like I'm his. That's nice no? I had a older married woman like that too. My... then in that case... we're the same. Only... essentially we are different. The woman is just spending money... but a man expects something for his investment. So you can't just accept it innocently. But... what if I don't want to return his favor? Even if you don't want to... he'll take it. Better to not take anything. But... I have no choice but to take it. I need money. I have to earn for my father also. I heard... your father works screen printing scarves. Enough... let's not talk about it. Say... I'll give you all my money... take me somewhere nice... wherever. Here... I have 210 yen and... three 8 yen stamps... and an 'amulet'. (Temple blessing) In total 234 yen... counting all of it. Chie... We meet here again. Mr. Kimura, you're hooked on this too. It's hard to stop coming here. How did you do? Did you bet on the favorite? I took 4 to place first. I bet on him too. Father, in the next race 2 and 3 are sure. Will you bet? No, I'm done for today. So you lost everything? If it's not too forward, please use this. - What? From another race nut. Don't be shy. - Thank you so much. Ah, not at all. Today I was keen and brought lots of money. Not just today... anytime you're in need, I'm happy to help out. Oh, thanks. Well then... Oh... Don't tell Chie anything about this. - Right. Chie... Wait up. You're cheating. You're running ahead too fast. Don't leave me alone. Really don't, eh. - Okay. Say... shall we go further inside? - But it's somebody's house. Let's go in. If there's a dog, it'll bark. Is it alright? It's fine. You go that way. Chie... come over here. Chie... This sound... it's frightening. - Frightening? I'm here. Chie... Chie... Why did you make me do this? I don't know. But... there must be a reason. Because... I wanted to forget everything. Did you meet the man who gives you money? Yes... though not any more. How much did you take? About thirty thousand yen. Thirty thousand eh. Thirty thousand yen, maybe I can manage that. When... I've returned the money and saved some, I'll buy the parrot. Parrot? - Yes. I'll teach him to say, "I'm happy". I'll make him say it every day. If I do that, maybe it'll make me feel a bit happier. "To die for love... is to merge in the sun." I read that somewhere. But... not many people can die for love. Like us. At a time like this... I'm only looking at the sea. What happened to your father? He said he was coming here and left. He hasn't come here. Surely not... only we left home together this morning. Maybe you didn't think why I called you during your work time. You say your father can't do hard work, then find him a desk job. It's just... my father suffers from nerve pain. What of it? He now thinks this work isn't important and doesn't come. He's completely irresponsible. These days... factories like ours, often pay less than minimum wage. We can't manage, if we don't cut costs. Please tell him we have to fire him. But... I'll give him a good talking to. Please let him stay a little longer. Good night. Great shift. Ah, I'm bushed. Say... let's walk to Yamate. Good idea. What about you, Chie. - Okay. Today, there was a customer... he was so disgusting. - Really? Wow, beautiful. Come on, hurry up. So beautiful. Chie... Aren't you worried to go inside? Wow, great! Come on. Cool place, isn't it? You came before, no? - Yah. Aki... wanna dance. You know it! Ah... welcome back. Why are you so late? Today... I hit it big. I took 5 to win on all races and I won 4 times. Mr. Nakamishi was so angry. He said, you're fired. I can't take care of you anymore. I felt so ashamed. I was going to go... but I had a stomach ache. How often can your stomach ache? You always say that. By the way... this is from Mr. Kimura for you. So you went with him. I begged you not to. Mr. Kimura... told me he wants to marry you no matter what. All we need is a yes from you. It would help me a lot. The answer's no. Listen... I'm begging you. What did you want to talk about? I'm thinking of getting married. Well... first you need to calm down. - I've thought about it seriously. A guy like you... what you need is an education in the red-light district. You find my way of speaking funny? No, it's not funny... just a bit juvenile. When a young man leaves his home town for work... he misses his mother and this happens. Take my case... up to my neck in women... to get married after almost drowning in them... it ripened me and marriage goes well. You're the one who said I should marry. Marriage isn't a game. How will you manage? - We'll both work. What'll you do about her father? Also there's the debt to deal with. And if I let her go... that Kimura guy is lurking, waiting to make his move. Let him deal with it. That way's much better. At that time I had been feeling... like a tired adventurer. Who, after all his escapades and wanderings... was almost ready to give up on life... was aimlessly seeking a rest. But from the moment I met Chie... it was as if my sense of youthful adventure had returned. Each time I met an obstacle, that passion grew... the spirit of adventure. The more I faced difficulties... as a river must flow to the sea... I longed to return to Chie's arms. EDITOR'S OFFICE Yah... hey... Hello. This is Ishibashi. What? Father's... in hospital. At the Tsurumi Velodrome... the crowd pushed forward and he was forced off the stands and fell. Yes... just now. I going there now. I couldn't get the details by phone... but it seems he broke his leg and collar bone. So we'll need some quick cash. In this situation you have to stay strong. I'll give you... as much as I can. Come to my room this evening. Keep your spirit up. And about the rich guy... that Kimura guy... right. Don't take any money from him no matter what... okay? Here... your laundry, it blew down. Your father... how is he? He needs four months complete rest. - Four months. Four months is it? I don't know what I should do? I'll do my best to raise the money. If my book sells it could mean twenty or thirty thousand yen. Today Father... was very lucky at the races. He always comes home with empty pockets. He came away with more than a thousand yen. If he hadn't left there in an ambulance... he might've drunk it all on the way home. Probably. Anyway, I'll get the money. Mr. Kimura... wants me to meet him. Maybe someone at work told him. Don't go. It's dirty money. Stay here tonight. If you go to your place Kimura might be waiting. I've... almost lost to him. Fool! What d'you mean lost. It's just money, that's all. Bring me a whiskey. You... what about your German classes. I stopped them. German's just not romantic. So you've stopped then. So that's why your tutor stopped coming. He was called Ishibashi, no? A nice fellow. Oh my... after a long time, Mr. Ishibashi. Madam's here. Please come in. I'll call her. Please come in. I'm glad you've come. - Yes. It's been awhile. We were just talking about you. It's good to see you. Make yourself at home. I'm feeling tired. I'll take a short nap. What is it? I need some money. Even so, it's good to see you. You only came here for money? Please listen to me. - That's right. At least I can listen. I can always say no. I could use a little drama. I'm very bored these days. - This is serious for me. I can always throw the dice. Madam... What's this all about? It's for the woman I want to marry. Are you... serious? - Yes. I was up thinking all last night. You're shameless you are. That's not the you I used to know. To stay forever as we were, was never going to happen. So... shall we go out dancing again? I need you to take this seriously... for me. Alright. If... for any reason you can't give me money... I'll be forced to ask your husband. In these matters... it's easier for men to understand each other. Are you trying to intimidate me? It's okay, it's only money. From the beginning... that's all I was to you. I'm going. You have no heart. Why didn't you lie to me? Why not say you were sick... or you'd spent all your money. If you'd said that I'd have given you lots more. Miss Azuma... Miss Azuma... I've been looking for you. Something bad's happened. Did Father do something? - He stole something. The purse of the man in the next bed. Oh no. - Anyway... please come to the nursing station. Father... you idiot! Why do such a bad thing? It seems the amount was only 150 yen. But the owner's just a laundry delivery man and is very angry. Well this is very troublesome and must never happen again. Sorry. As your dad... I feel very bad causing trouble for you and Mr. Ishibashi. Were you waiting? - Yes. I've been busy all morning. The court, the Prosecutor's and the district offices. Running between the three. I'm beat. But, when I'm working I forget about money problems. Oh... so what was it? Only... I really wanted to see you. Right. Your father... what's up? Same as always. Hopefully he gets well soon. For our sake too. Even for only a single day... I'd like to have no money worries at all. You remember... here? You said you wanted a parrot... didn't you? If I die... it would be a relief. My father should die too. - Why this all of a sudden? I want... a big tree that I can cling to. Look... this one's big. I wish I could be strong like it. Right... I get it. Yes... on my way. I'm leaving. - Good bye. Yes. This is ISHIBASHI Kiyoshi. Which Mr. Kimura is that? What? The Kimura Group...? Right. I'm on the night shift today. You can come. But not for too long. WINNERS' COFFEE "Coffee and music" In effect Chie and I are a couple now. That's why... taking care of her is my responsibility. So I'd like you to back off. I figured you'd say that. Like one? For me... I don't care what your relationship is with Chie. Let's talk frankly then. My father is also opposed to her. So it's not easy for me. It looks to me... both you and I... would be wise to give up on this woman. Of course... I don't particularly want to be wise. What's there between you and Chie? Well... what can I say... I can provide for Chie's happiness. Sorry, but can you? Chie doesn't like you. I know. 110 percent I know. But she's tired of being poor. The first thing to do is to relieve her of that, no? As to whether she finds happiness or not... should come after that don't you think? Money... can never buy happiness. However... without money you can't even pay for little things. For example her father's hospital bills. Without insurance they must be 30,000 by now. If we both remain stubborn there will be no solution. Ishibashi... a word. There's work... I need you to go now to Osaka for two days. I'm... - Stupid! This is more important than a woman. Ticket. There's no time to give you the details. It's all in this envelope. Read it in the train. It's so sudden. - Yes. Corruption in the municipal assembly. They're selling off old US Army land. The auction process is corrupt. There's a meeting of mayors in Osaka. Seems the mayor's hiding there for a few days. I'm going. Don't worry about her. Go for it. Chie...? - She took leave. That's strange. We haven't heard from her since morning. I don't know if she's sick or not. That's right. There's no time to go to her house now. Please tell her that I'll be in Osaka for a few days. Also tell her not to over do it. Okay? It's all so sudden. This all started only a few days ago. It feels almost like a year has passed. My efforts to find documents confirming corruption failed. When I returned from Osaka... there was a letter waiting in my apartment. I opened it quickly. It wasn't from Chie. But rather from her father, AZUMA Rikio He wrote that he wanted to meet me and talk. ( Race broadcast. ) You called me? It's no big deal. So, Ishibashi-san... You see... Chie... made up her mind. Your daughter... where is she? - Well. She left with Mr. Kimura. She dreamed of wearing a green suit at least once... so he took her to get it made. No one will come to the wedding anyway. but she longed to wear it with him in the church. You... you sold Chie to Kimura, didn't you? Sold... no, nothing like that! But Mr. Kimura has been very good to me. He has shown me kindness many times. But don't tell Chie. So far he has helped me to the tune of 150,000 yen. Chie didn't know anything about it. She only received a little from him... or so she thinks. Listen Mr. Ishibashi... You also helped me a lot, I can't say how sorry I am. But... can't you let her go? But of course... it's not something you'd want to do. I need you to give her up. If you are willing to withdraw, then Chie and I will survive. Being so lovesick, only happens when you're young. If you and Chie were together, she might be okay, but I wouldn't survive. Isn't that right? When we move into the house Kimura will build for us, our struggles will be over. Chie will forget everything else. Chie said that? Yes, yes. Actually... she left with Mr. Kimura... to get the green suit made... very happily. Right... Mr. Ishibashi? Now you know this, won't you give her up? So that's how it is. I understand. Chie... Chie... Some time later... Chie married Kimura. Oh my... what are you doing? Sorry, I couldn't figure out the bell so I just came in. Oh, Father... Taiichi... Please come in. - Right. Ah... what a gorgeous house you have! - Not really. Well... what about breakfast? We're just starting. That "good timing", isn't it? My my... you have some fine canes here. Feel free, if you'd like one. Chie... What a nice kimono he bought you. A baby will no doubt follow. Father... come. - Right. Wa... such a gorgeous study, isn't it! Father... will take breakfast with us. Make it ready. - Yes. Father! Chie... my cigarettes from the bedroom. - Yes. Good morning. What are you up to today, father? - Golfing... at Sagami. With Mr. Nomura and young Takagi. How about you? I'll pass. Is the waitress getting used to the house? You mean Chie? I overheard the servants... they said she's nervous and awkward. And she's only good at serving tea. More importantly, I want to get our marriage registered. There's no rush to get that done. Father... why don't you golf with me? Don't forget the importance of golf in making business contacts. Yes... what... an incident... right. Takashima branch already there... ya... ya... Okay, we'll be in touch. - I'm on it. Hey, breaking news. What? - What? Not a big story. Young wife, hit by car, very pretty. Hey! Ishibashi, there's an accident. Crash at Takashima crossing. Four cars involved. Four cars? - Listen up. In all five dead. Stop it! Hey... what should I do with these photos? Ah... won't be enough space. No use then. It's cut and hanging. How are you these days? - What? You stopped talking about that girl. - Yah. Work comes first. You get dumped? It's that... she got married. Really? Ya, maybe it's better She's probably doing well. I hope so. Mr. Ishibashi... Hey. After a long time. - I've been too busy lately. I doubt that. We're right next door yet you never come. We presumed you were going to the hospital every day. Going to the hospital? - Of course. To see Chie-chan. What! Chie's that ill? It's been two months already. It was in the papers. An accident hospitalized her. The hospital... which one? - Central Hospital. Excuse me... I'd like to see AZUMA Chie. AZUMA Chie? - Yes. There is no one here by that name. That can't be... No... It's Kimura... KIMURA Chie, I meant to say. Mrs. Kimura? She was moved to another department two months ago. Another department... which one? The Psychiatric Ward. You called me just to tell me that, Father? Of course I did. About that... yesterday evening I told you Chie is my wife. I will decide what I do. I've been against this from the beginning. I didn't send you to study in New York... just to marry a coffee shop waitress. Still you came to our wedding. You two selfishly decided... to live together as you like. All I could do was watch. However... totally damaged after two weeks, I won't accept it. Luckily... the marriage registration hasn't been done yet. We'll pay to cover her medical costs. That way, our family will be free from taking her in. - But... Chie hasn't gone crazy. She's lost her balance. The doctor said so. No. She's only suffering from memory loss. It's the same thing! Oh, just a minute. So... I read your letter... so I came. Sorry for always bothering you. I just started back here the other day. It's all because of that Kimura son of a pig! Haven't you been to see Chie yet. No, no. It's not all that serious. It was only a small accident and she just lost her memory. They told me at the hospital. Mr. Kimura senior came the day before yesterday. He gave me a measly two hundred thousand. Then he said they would accept no further responsibility. What!? If something's a bit damaged, rich people just throw it out. Someone's living child, they simply discarded her. He divorced her then? But Mr. Ishibashi... I deicded not to bother you for money any more. I've quit drinking and gambling. Sincerely, I realise I caused you a lot of trouble. I have no right to ask you for anything, but just one thing... I would like you to meet Chie. If you were to meet Chie... there's a chance it might help bring her memory back. She's under the care of Dr. Miyamoto. I'm begging you... please meet her... meet her at least once. Her condition is called psychogenic retrograde amnesia. Something causing mental stress... and her brain's inability to deal with it, is the cause. Miss Chie's case is due to family breakdown, financial stress... and marriage issues, all of which combined to cause the stress. Consequently... those stressful memories are lost to her. Now she's really at peace. Really at peace? When a lizard gets his tail stuck between rocks... he sheds it and runs away. It's not only true for lizards we can shed... our bad memories too, no? Do such cases really happen? In Chie's case... her memories have dissappeared... but her conscious mind remains. What happens now? Actually it's like this. Human memory... think of it as a cylinder. This deep part... well, lets call these memories. They exist here. But after a some shock... the memories are cut off... from the deeper part. these memories... disappear. The result is... the patient doesn't know their own name. If I give them wool and knitting needles... they know how to knit. But what they wanted to knit they have forgotten. If I give them a newspaper they can read it. But when asked, they can't explain it. What a sad thing has happened. Is it impossible to recover? It won't happen all at once. They can slowly, slowly recover, but in some cases they don't. In any case, it requires patience. Well... meet with her first. Mrs. Kimura... - Yes. So... first you go in. Chie... it's me. So... do you recognize me? Who am I? Is there anything you'd like to eat? Ice cream. Who is that man? A man who knows you very well. Do you recognize him? There's nothing to worry about. He's a good man. Is it okay if from time to time... I come to visit you? Certainly. Doctor... how will she recover? Electric shock treatment... sometimes brings memories back. But Miss Chie's case happened after she was injured. So such treatment wouldn't be advised. If there is anything I can do... I will do it. However I can help her recover, please tell me. I understand your feelings. Still... that's not the only way it can be done. What's the best way? There's "Amytal Interview". A kind of sleep inducing injection... that causes an hypnotic state. Well, it's a kind of mesmerism. In this interview, the patients try hard to remember. They struggle to remember their memories. If it goes well, they can remember all their memories. Next time you come, we will try. Please do. Why haven't you come to see Chie? I... I'm not her husband anymore. Although Chie never really thought of me as her husband. To say that now is rather cowardly. You can't end it by just giving money. I'm not the one who gave the money. If I had the money to pay her myself... I could look Chie in the eye. I didn't get in this car to hear your excuses. If you won't do it... I will do my best to help Chie get her memory back. Though I can't say what her memories will be. After that, please don't offer her any support. Whatever needs to be done, I will do. Mr. Ishibashi... go ahead and look down on me. Look at me with contempt. I want to hear you say it. Stop the car. I'll get out. Ishibashi-san... please... take care of Chie. We'll try "Amytol Interview". Please don't say anything. So... any problems? Are you feeling a little better? How are you feeling? Don't you remember anything? You will surely remember. Didn't you go to buy spring onions? You know... the day you were hit by the car. Can't you remember? Doctor... What? I feel it coming back to me. You can remember... yes. It's as if... it's not... very clear. But I can remember some things. Just try to relax. Think very deeply. The sea... Where that is I don't know. The sea... I can see it clearly. We were staying there. We were married. Why... can't I remember the way from the station? But on the way I get lost. It's okay if you don't remember. You can talk about... something else. I can't even remember my husband. What was I doing there? It was a company... the Kimura Group wasn't it? That's not right. But anyway... outside the house entrance... there is a broken child's cycle. It's been exposed to the weather. There's an old lawnmower there. There's a hat in the room. It has a wide brim. A hat with a pointed top. Many kinds... interesting... hats. There's one that looks like a sunflower. The sound... it's scarry. The sea... is everywhere there. And you? Was it that your married life was unhappy? No. Such an idea... is completely wrong. Before marriage... we were... in love with each other. Doctor... why doesn't he come for me? Why... why can't I go back home? Welcome. Miss Aiko? What? - NATSUKI Aiko? She's not here. You've been away a long time. Miss Aiko? - She left here. She left recently. - You'll do fine. About AZUMA Chie, anything about an old lawnmower? A lawnmower? Yes... a lawnmower. She stayed in a rented row-house. There was no lawn. Maybe she went somewhere were there was a lawn. That's right... the foreigner's house at Yamanote. Actually we all went together. There was a lawn there. Ishibashi-san... "Hats..." "There were hats in a room." "A pointed one with a big brim." This Dr. Miyamoto said... Chie's memories of marriage to the other you are false then? Yes. Chie... forgot all her unhappy memories. She lives in a happy dream of marriage which she's created in her imagination. And... now she... protects that illusion adamantly. So before she married... her dream was to marry you. Yes, I think so. However... now there's no way to confirm it. Anyway it will come out in time. But anyway you're a happy man. In this world for a woman to love a man so intensely, is simply hard to believe. It's not like that. Her lover before marriage... there's no way she'll come to see me as the same person. Now that... her love grows ever stronger for the man she remembers... Her need to remember me grows less and less. She loves that man so much... there's almost no hope she'll remember the real me. Who are you? I knew you very well before you married. And... from now on I'm going to take care of you. Why do you want to take care of me. Because you have nowhere else to go. Before... I was hoping to marry you. Oh my... But... I have a lover. I love him so much, I could never marry someone else. This lover of yours... is he anything like me? I can't really say. I can't remember his face. Are you married? No... not yet. So you can't be that person. Because that man was married to me. There was a "keyaki" tree... and also an old lawnmower. (Zelkova elm) He came back from his morning walk. I had made fried eggs and was waiting for him. When he came back... Are my eyes beautiful today? I asked him. Then he always smiled, showing his lovely white teeth. I was in love with you for quite a long time. Hypothetically... regardless... could you start again... and agree to marry me. It's not that I don't like you. But... I would feel bad for him. I couldn't. Someday... I'll remember the way. I'll go back to him. When I go back, I'll mow the lawn. I'll put the hats away... and get the broken cycle repaired. Half a month later... I got Chie discharged and we moved into my apartment. At that time... when Chie was asked to write her name... by someone... she was able to write very neatly AZUMA Chie. Cases of long term false memory are not so common. But... except for this condition Chie was completely normal. When I came back to my room... in the usual darkness of my room, there was now a small light. This small happiness broke my heart. Welcome back. - I'm home. You didn't... have any headaches? - No. Ahh... I'm famished. So...Chie... What? We should... get married... okay? Until... that man comes back to you. But... when he comes back he'll scold me. Actually by that man, I mean... No... don't talk about him anymore. Yes, you're right. When you remember clearly... I will definitely return you to him... I'm telling you. So, you shouldn't worry. The sooner you remember him the better. You won't be jealous? Of him? - He's a good man, really good. Chie... when we met you were always looking at someone else. Yes... it was a rainy day. You didn't have an umbrella. "I like walking in the rain," you told me. When someone said my socks were smelly... it was you who said, "Shall I wash them?" We used to go to see the ocean. So... this voice of mine... isn't it familiar? Yes... similar to that man's voice. You borrowed 30 thousand yen. We often went to the pawn shop... with that money... because your father spent it at the races. It was for the hospital fees. You used to say... "To die for love is to merge in the sun. "However... not many people can die for love." And then you said that... in that case... you wanted to watch the ocean in silence. To say something like that... has to be AZUMA Chie. I know AZUMA Chie... no. Don't you remember something? a little bit... anything? Stop it. You've... told me so many things. about the blue sea... about the bright sun. It's almost like we truly love each other. It makes me feel very pleasant. But... it's wrong. His sea is more blue. And his sun must be brighter. Why "must be" Chie? Do you remember that brightness? Can you remember that blue? That blue is an illusion. Don't say that... about his sea. That man you see in that blueness... that man is me. It's me. - Not that man. You are not that man! Not you. Chie... Chie! Then please do it carefully. - Yes. What's with... the girlfriend? Not well? Since yesterday... she's been trying to remember something. She's struggling. My timings really bad for you. Actually, I need you to work a bit far away. Where is it? - Near Kamakura. To report on a group forming a new cult. So then... go to the Prawn Restaurant on the beach road and wait 'til we call. Watch out! The maid servants are saying... that the new wife is nervous and awkward. She only knows how to serve tea. Father, what are you doing? What of it? He now thinks this work isn't important and doesn't come. He's completely irresponsible. City Hospital is in Urabune-cho, isn't it? Ah... Mr. Ishibashi... I thought so... is it Chie? How is her condition? Seems she's now at a critical point. I can't believe she tried suicide? I can't either. She's too sensitive, that girl. Please let me see her. You can't see her now. How is she? Myself, I don't know. Excuse me, here's a change of clothes. Ah... Doctor... An emergency call. Sorry I'm so late. I'm sorry. How is she? - I don't know. But... why would she want to die? Miss Chie... maybe she remembered something. However this improvement led her to the sea. Could be it wasn't a good memory. Maybe... her happy marriage proved to be a false memory. She realized it was all an illusion. She had to be sure to protect her happy illusion. Kiyoshi-san.. She's out of danger now. I must go... I have to work. Don't worry about what comes next. If anything at all happens, we'll notify you. She'll be okay, no? She keeps calling your name. Hello... It's Chie-san... thia morning after her fever came down she got dressed. When I asked where she was going, she shook her head. Yes. I think there's no danger. In case anything strange happens... I assigned a nurse to follow her. Do you have any idea at all where she might want to go? Oh... she's leaving the hospital now. Right! Kiyoshi-san. Chie... Chie! Kiyoshi-san!
