- What's that you have? - Vodka. - He's sleeping. - And otherwise? He always took his commitments seriously. Commitments are serious. Do you know what it means to make your vows in public? It's a serious matter. Don't say you've never made a promise. - Forever. - I'm free. - As a bird. - Like me. - Hunt and peck. What's that? - You interested? No, but the kids will learn about it at school. Bye! I'm going. - Klara? - Yeah? Be careful. - Comrade Kadlecova! - Yes? What are you doing here? I was there. Now I'm going back. Are you making fun of me? - You've been drinking. - No. You've been drinking. So Comrade Kadlecova, Miss Kadlecova... You're fired. It's not just your drinking. I refuse to put up with your bad attitude. We'll take care of the formalities tomorrow. The Artist. - Twenty minutes, Mr. Vesely. - Don't shout! You must be on time. If you plan to overthrow the proletarian government. We just want human rights for the proletariat, too. A lecture! I don't know which of us is against the working class. Klara's a member of the proletariat and you had her fired. Or was that her boss's idea? Oh, please! We have something for you. A gift. With a photo. You look younger in it. We take a left here. I'm glad you're here. I'll open the window. It's a lovely day. Don't go outside. It's not safe. - Are you being careful? - I am. Be careful. - I am, Dad. - Please be careful. I'm careful, Dad. Please be careful. I am. It isn't always easy. Sometimes I'm afraid my head's going to explode. Sometimes I hope it does, but I am careful. I've learned to be. There is a power involved. An evil power. They're just slaves to it. I've beaten them down. I keep them at arm's length. I try. Sometimes it feels like the power is fucking me. Fucking me with fire and I can't defend myself. Sometimes I even like it. Horrible. Horrible. You can't fire Kadlecova. - Can't do much about it now. - You have to. I've told the Party Organization. The Party's authority is at stake. - That's your problem, broad. - Never speak to me like that again! Don't you get it yet, cunt? This is not a discussion. These are orders. Grit your teeth and say, "As you wish." If you don't, I'll threaten to strike you or even knife you. You'll give in anyway. So don't waste my time. So what's it going to be? - I'll do what you want! - At ease. Dismissed. Know what you're looking at? I hoped things between us would get better, but they're even worse. I thought I'd be happy here. I'm not. And I don't even know why. Are you seeing someone? No. No, but I'd love to. - Let's talk. - You're right. I've seen this coming. Fine. It would be great if you were gone by the time I wake up tomorrow. Huh? If you were gone. What? I'm not going anywhere. You're not leaving until morning. Okay. Watch this. Get it now? Stop it! I can't fold these things. Tomorrow you'll have enough time. I'm going to sleep late. Fine. Fine. What's new? What could possibly be new? Stupid, shitty things. How's it going? Sleeping better with no kids around? Get a hard-on when you need one? Chicks believe your bullshit? Klara, it's a bad world, so let me fuck you. Is that how it works? Don't you feel pathetic? That's the only thing you know. You're nothing more than your badge. It's your head, heart, and cock. Set it aside and see what's left. Is this what you're talking about? This isn't me. I don't give a damn about anything. What do you see now? Tell me what you see now. Look at it through your eyes. You can't see a thing. You're afraid to look. You don't want to see it. I look. I see everything clearly. So clearly it hurts. Why stay here if you can't handle the pain? Why don't you leave? Why the hell don't you want to be happy? You can't treat Tomas Sykora like that. I won't allow it. - I can't work with you. - Shut up. Patience. The whole Sykora affair is partly your fault, Mr. Vesely. You don't use the influence you have over him. Don't be surprised then. - You can't... - Can't what? You're one of us, so act like it. He's my friend. Exactly. Have a man-to-man talk with him. Explain what he should do and we'll all be happy. Or don't you want to help him? As a friend? What kind of people are you? Lunatics who breathe into bags. Do you want to be done? Do you? Then get out! Get out, you asshole! This country isn't worth it! What do you want to prove? That you'll survive it? That they won't get you? But you won't survive and they will get you. What are you waiting for? Maybe you'll find a life abroad. You shouldn't just think of yourself. You have commitments. Go home, pack, and flee. If you stay, I won't respect you. Don't be angry. I had to tell you. I'm not angry. Everyone is so concerned. They know what I'm like. - Ever thought about my feelings? - Those are not feelings, Tomas. It's a sickness. You're full of germs. Klara is one. So am I. This haunted house you hide in is a germ, too. This city is a swamp of infections. Die if you want. Join the losers up here and wait to croak. Damn it, Tomas! We're alone here. We're friends. Quit talking in Newspeak. Do you want it? They're stupid for offering you this. You want it. - Don't you? - I guess. Of course I do. Please let me be. I can't expect you to understand. Why not? I'm an understanding wife. - I never wanted to hurt you. - What crap! - Lf you didn't, you wouldn't have. - You're right. I screwed up. Should I pretend nothing happened and forget about everything? We can leave. Make that cop happy. You can't be serious. Sorry. I forgot my part in the story about Tomas' integrity. I don't want my role anymore. Our children are done, too. Break up with Miss Kadlecova and take us away from all this, or you can say goodbye to us. I never imagined you'd say that. I never imagined you'd betray me. - Understand... - I do. And I'm sick of it. - What should I do? - Break up with me. If I were you I'd have done so long ago. - Lf you were you, what would you do? - I'm just ruining your life. - You have to break up with me. - Quiet! That's my business. Leave if you want. Don't ask me to fix anything for you. Forgive me for everything. Strange he thought I was worth it. I thought it was worthless. I'd given up. - Don't say that. - The end was odd. That's good for us. I'll doll you up. Make them all drool. You'll have your pick. I need this right now. I said, "New hair, a new girl." I'll take charge and everything will be different. - I expected you to be afraid. - Should I be? - You're my handler. - Fine. If you want to leave us, introduce me to Klara Kadlecova. But she can't know my name or what I do for a living. You must be joking, but you don't know what that is. So you're jealous. You're an idiot. But you seem more humane this way. I'm thrilled. What do you think? It's pretty crazy. You can't meet Klara like this. You dress and talk weird. You must listen to retarded music, too. I'll have to teach you. Give me a little time. Let's meet next week at three in the cemetery near here. I want something from you, too. I want to read your file on me. - Bring it with you. - Wow! You have great ideas. Almost as good as ours. - Did you just make that up? - No, I have a head. And I use it. - What'll it be? - What choice do I have? True. We somehow ended up together. Right, Comrade? Stop shooting. Weapons inspection. Go look at what you've shot. They're really into it. Just like their Grandpa. Do you plan to have children? You should. Straightens a guy out. - My wife and I split. - I heard. I'm not happy about it. - Did she find out about the whores? - I don't do that anymore. - Oh? Then I should worry about you. Any hope you'll make it right? I don't want to. I should say something different, but I understand. We have it tough. We protect the others, but we aren't like them. We're different. What can you do? - How's work, Tonda? - I'm managing. The service is more than a job. It's your Dad, Mom, old lady. Remember it isn't a whore you fuck, pay, and forget about. Anyone who fucks us will pay big. We don't forget. Pulls a bit to the right. Think on it, Tonda. Remember what they taught us. Fiery heart, clean hands, cool head. My head's cooler than ever. Comrade Major. I understand. So much so that it makes me mad. Can't I fantasize? Everyone does. - Don't say you don't. - I guess I do. I'd like to leave, too, but they won't give me the chance. We write to each other. If you want to read his letters, you can. Not really. Thanks. Or do you think it would be wise? If we were wise, we'd have different worries. Come on Tuesday evening. We can grieve together. We'll enjoy it. - You're irresistible. - I know. - Guarantee I'll never see him again? - Calm down. The file is proof. We'll both be rid of him for good. You don't have to fear him now. He's just a lunatic. He must be a total wreck. Trust a professional. Now's it's just routine. What about our other agreement? This is for you. This is for you. Come to my place tomorrow night. I'll leave you two alone there. I'll think of something. Don't think of trying anything. No need to scare me. I've always been afraid of you. See that? It's so puzzling. All because of an ordinary girl. - What's with you? - You should go. Run along. So here you are. I'm going drinking. - Really? - I need to talk. You're the only guy I can talk to. That's a compliment coming from you. The Major says you're our best man. Goodbye! You're up there, too. Come. My car's here. Perfect organization. Trust a professional. Come in. I'll look for the vodka. What happened here? I was looking for something. A li... A lighter. I don't smoke. I forgot. A lighter. Look. It's against regulations to take it home. This isn't my home. Put the safety on, Martin. It could go off accidentally. What do you want to do? Drink. To us, Martin! To the good life, as you say. - Funny, huh? - It's embarrassing. What do you think of me? You're capable. Talented. But you're one of those people who, how would I put it... when you enter a room, it's like someone turned off the lights. That was good. You make that up? It was good, and yes, I did. You keep putting me down. Sometimes it pisses me off, Tonda. It's not fair. - Hey, are we colleagues? - What? - Are we colleagues? - What else would we be? Of course. Good. Ever go to work in the rain? - Yeah. - When it was raining stones? Stones? Right. It happened to me. First you try to avoid them. Then you don't give a crap. You'd never get where you're going. So I don't avoid the stones. It's painful, but who cares? - Understand? - Not for shit. That's okay. Martin, are we colleagues? We're colleagues. We're colleagues. You bet. We're colleagues. - We're colleagues. - Yup. Is this the place? Is this is where... Get up! Antonin! - Act rational. Don't make it worse. - Do I look rational? What did I do to you? Leave me alone! Antonin, it's only my work! It's only my work! Yours, too! You get various assignments. Please! Shut up! I'm still young. My life is just begin... Then enjoy the shit if it matters that much to you, little boy! - Satisfied? - Do you care? - What would you say? - That I don't care. Nice and clean in here. Just like home, Comrade. Lots of books. Hell of a lot. Good ones? I'm trying to read your prose. Satisfied? At least I have written proof of what idiots you are. Think you can file a person into a report? Bureaucratic pride. One day you'll pay. You wrote most of the reports. I'm at war with you. You don't understand that yet. Wouldn't want you to ruin your eyes. "When he enters a room, it's like someone turned off the lights." Nice. I don't know which of us is proud. - I just... - Shush... Our friend can't make it. We'll make a deal without him. It would be wise for you to go read elsewhere while I take care of this. To hell with what happens then. That's all I need from you. Is that too much? So get going! And Klara? Do you care about her? There you go. See? You can do it. It suits you. Pavel had something pressing. He'll be back. - Should I come another time? - No. The reading material is ready. You're to wait for him here. The papers are in the living room. That's okay. The living room's there. I know. I've been here before. Your reading. A painting. I see. A table. I'll bring you some refreshments. Refreshments? We should be on a first-name basis. I'm Robert Krahulik, Pavel's friend from far away. That's not important. Klara. - Have we seen each other somewhere? - Doubtful. I'd remember. Go read. Interesting reading? Letters from a friend. - Why do you read at Vesely's place? - You mean Pavel's? He writes to Pavel. Not to me. Can't be much of a friend. Does he ask or write about you? - I see. - I don't like your tone. What tone? - Like you know everything. - I can see you're unhappy and alone. - I'm asking you to cut the crap. - I'm unhappy and alone, too. Are you suggesting we share our unhappiness? No, thanks. I wanted to say there's nothing wrong with being unhappy and alone. Just learn to appreciate it. I did. Everything's been more colorful since then. - Colorful? - This morning I was in the woods. Like seeing trees and hearing birds for the first time. An experience! - I don't understand. - Obviously. You weren't there. Too bad. Sometimes I'm surprised how everything comes together. I don't know that feeling. It's amazing. I'm going to the kitchen. Come talk to me later. This came together. What're you thinking? I don't think. Thinking creates a chasm in me. At times I fall in. I don't like it. Not surprising. Now I see a glass maze. This candle is in the middle. It's reflected in your eyes a thousand times. What do you see? This place. It was my place. I came here to hide. If everything were so simple. It is. - You can't expect anything from me. - This is what I expect. Don't be afraid. Nothing else is going to happen. It's all over now. It's dark again. I guess that's how it should be. - I'm leaving. - Don't go. Sorry, but this is pointless. I was in a state. It takes time for my body to catch up. This is the only time we have. It was enough for me. Let me go. Can't stop thinking about that fucker, can you? What the fuck do you think? You're not going anywhere! You cocksucker! You've no idea what I could've done and what I didn't do. Klara, what's with you? Want to smell shit until you die? Those pitiful, stinky feelings? He left because he was afraid of you and wasn't good enough for you. - That's a stinking lie! - The lie is over. Brace yourself. Let me go. I don't need you now. Need? What crap! You don't know shit. You drive your crane thinking you're immune to what's below you. Wrong. There are monsters below that are plotting against you. - What in God's name do you mean? - Why do you come here to hide? The "classy" writer uses everyone. He turns on everyone. He's a rat. He got you. He thinks he got me. He got the asshole that cried to you about his guilt for fucking you. I punished the pig. Someone had to. It was the easiest thing ever. - Still think you had a relationship? - What are you talking about? About the two of us. We're different. We don't belong in this shit. You're here for a reason. You just don't see the mess you're in. I'm here for a reason, too. I'm pushing it all aside. I don't care if I get dirty. I'll protect you. My hands are clean. I have cool head and fiery heart. Touch it! Grab it! Crush the glowing swine! - Water! - Get out! My name is Antonin. Antonin Rusnak. I felt someone watching me. Never do that again. You're the chasm I don't want to fall into. Have fun? I hope you loved it. You're fucked. They know everything. - You must be pleased. - You bet I am. You always have a plan. What is it? I'm leaving. - You'll get a longer leash, you dog. - I'd agree to that. I'll gladly help the swine devour each other. Drop me off by the river. - Here's the river. - Already? - Wasn't that quick? - Not at all, colleague. Know what I wanted to say? That I got you and it hurts. - Hello? - Is that you, Tomas? I have news about Pavel. Oh, so you're... Sorry. A mess. Go to hell! You think you know something. You don't know a thing. Is this me? This is just a body. A pathetic body. A shell. One day it'll turn to dust. The reports you wrote about me and those I wrote will turn to dust. You will turn to dust. I don't live here. I live up here. Eternal things are born up here. This head is ready for eternity. "Swine" Watch the stairs. Klara! - Klara! - Darina, what happened? I don't know... - Can I go with you? - Yes. Thank you. They're coming. Get up. Your rank was lieutenant. Your name: Antonin. You want her to remember your name. You forget. You've been here. The sky is burning. It's beautiful here.
