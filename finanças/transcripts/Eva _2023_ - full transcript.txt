Mama, you've been out since early morning. You're always so eager to feed the cows. The early bird catches the first worm, right? Why are you here, Miqal? Because I know the truth. You know this, right? Your statement... ...will be recorded today... ...under Section 112 Criminal Procedure Code... ...which will be used in court later on. I want to do this. I have to. Good. Let's do this. I only have a couple of questions. You said earlier that you felt the pain. When you felt the pain, what did you do? When I felt the pain, I told him,... ..."It hurts. Please, it hurts." And when you said you were hurting... ...what did the accused do? He just carried on. He didn't even stop. Where were your hands? -At that time... ...I was holding on to the sheets... ...because I couldn't stand the pain. What else did you do with your hands? I only held on to the sheets. What did you feel at that time? At that time, I felt angry,... ...I felt humiliated,... ...I felt disgusted. No other questions, Your Honour. With the court's permission, I present to you... ...the medical report, also known as P4. I ask that the P4 be presented to the witness. Based on the history report,... ...I found out that you've always been taking pills... ...called the "morning-after". Do you agree? Yes, but..... -I only asked if you agree or not. I don't need your explanation. With the court's permission. And based on the analysis of the exhibit... ...at the chemistry department... ...the pills are also known as Levonogestrel. Do you agree? I agree. And I was also told that... ...you know the accused really well. You're so close with the accused... ...that when he invited you to his house... ...you agreed immediately. I agree. He did invite me. Do you agree or not? And when this so-called rape happened,... ...you went to the home of the accused willingly. Agree? Yes. -And when you were... ...in his room at his house,... ...when the accused inserted his genitals into yours,... ...you only said it hurt. You didn't ask him to stop. Do you agree or not? -Objection, Your Honour. That's a speculation. Proceed. Do you understand my question or not? You only said you were in pain. You didn't ask him to stop. Do you agree or not? -I agree, but..... You also didn't say no and you didn't run away. And you just allowed the accused to penetrate,... ...with the court's permission, willingly. Do you agree? And it all happened when the accused... ...was allegedly raping you. Agree? This incident happened on the 2nd of February 2020... ...and you made a police report on the 15th of July 2020,... ...five months after the incident. Do you agree? I agree. -Why didn't you make... ...the report right away? You were raped, with the court's permission. What took you so long? Or were you trying to come up with a story first? Objection, Your Honour. Counsel is attacking the witness. Calm down, counsel. Can you answer the question? I didn't know what to do. I was scared. I..... I was confused. -I'm assuming... ...that you're confused because the rape incident... ...never happened. The two of you like each other... ...and you're scared because you're trying to lie. You made a report five months after the incident... ...because four months after all this happened,... ...the accused decided to break up with you. You were angry at the accused. You wanted to take revenge. However all that happened was consensual,... ...you were willing, you didn't avoid it. And you never said, "Stop". And you willingly... ...took birth control pills. Do you agree? Soon, the judge will present the results... ...at the end of the trial. You'll be a free man in a while. Madam, the judge is ready. There she is. Let's go. Madam, aren't you ashamed of representing a rapist? I need to ask you, how could you represent a rapist? Answer me, madam. With this, the court has decided to release and acquit the accused... ...without being called to defend himself. The bail money will be refunded. Thank you very much. I chose the right lawyer. It's true what people said, only you can set me free. How did you..... -We want explanations, madam. Madam! Sir, congratulations on winning the case. Sir. -Why, sir? I'm sure you're pleased that you won this case. How much did you pay her? -This isn't fair, sir. Have you any comments? -You heard what the judge said. Hi. -Hi. Thank you very much, Miss Elly. I don't know what to say, but I'm so happy... ...because as a parent I really like... ...seeing the change in my daughter.... ...since she had the heart-to-heart session with you. The most obvious, Miss Elly, is when my daughter is at home,... ...she is no longer a quiet girl. The girl who likes to bottle up her feelings is gone. Now, she has started to open up. She has started talking to us, telling stories,... ...and sharing whatever, well,... ...whatever she wants to share with us. I am so glad that you reached out. Not many parents know what is happening to their children. Sometimes they get worse. I pity them. Miqal. Bye. Miqal, what's the matter? You pulled a long face. And you scurried angrily away. What's wrong? Talk to me. Auntie,... ...just imagine, I failed biology again. I feel so discouraged. You became moody just because you failed the biology test? Seriously? Just because I failed the biology test? Really, aunty? If mama knows about this, I'd be doomed. Mama would be disappointed, big time. Miqal, you know this, right? There is no secret in our family. It's not good for you to lie to your mama like that. I'm sure she won't get mad. Why don't you ask your mum to teach you? Wait. Yes. That's right, aunty. I always see mama reading books about human biology. Especially when she's stressed out. You're so cool. -Give me a high five! Thanks for the idea, aunty. Miqal, everyone will face failure in life. I will be more frustrated if you didn't fail. Because if you never fail,... ...you won't learn how to survive in life. Okay? Okay. Sorry. Mama, why are you looking at me like that? Let me guess. Are you in some sort of trouble? If I tell you,... ...you can't get angry, okay? I will tell you the problem,... ...but I will also give you the solution. Okay, mama? Okay. Tell me. I failed in biology again, mama. That's my problem now. But I know,... ...the only solution to this... ...is you teaching me that subject. This is what I mean. You like to read books... ...that are related to biology, right? I am so proud of you for failing. Miqal, my dear. Failures make us human, okay? If you don't learn how to accept your failure... ...or how to get back up after failing,... ...sooner or later you're bound to fail again... ...when you face a bigger test. So, don't worry about it. I am super proud of you. Sometimes I feel like... ...I'm living in the same house with an influencer. Influencer? Well, someone made the news again. "Rape accuser devastated as case being dropped,... ...thanks to the well-renowned lawyer, Eva." Okay. Look. Mama made the news again. Nice. Is someone trying to win my heart? Mama. Yesterday you said you wanted to help me, right? To teach me biology? Failing is good. But repeating your failure, is not. Okay? Just eat up. Mama is so weird. Who am I? My husband. -Do as I say. I want it. -I don't want to. It hurts. I want it. -Please, honey. If you do as I say, you will be satisfied. It hurts, honey. I don't want to. -Lie down. No, honey. Please, honey. -Lie down. Don't do this to me. I don't want to! Honey. No, honey. Honey. No, honey. It hurts. Please. Keep away from me. Honey, it hurts! You want me to act violently? It hurts, honey! It hurts there! Honey, it hurts! -Come here. Hey! You dare defy me? Shut up. Shut up! Our son will hear, honey. I don't want to! Honey. Honey, please. Don't hit me. Honey. Please, honey. Hey, I'm your husband! Honey. It hurts, honey! Please! Calm down. It's just me. Why is the garage full of plastic? What is all this for? Mike asked for it. Maybe he wants to paint. I just did what he told me to do. Mike? Painting? That's new to me. By the way, why didn't Eva go to her doctor's appointment? Maybe because she feels she doesn't need to go? I think? I don't know. Amy. We've been dealing with this since we were little, right? So, please? Fine. I'll talk to Eva. But she has a date. A date? Since when did Eva start going out? You took the oath earlier, right? So, I am asking you once again. In this case, the tearing up of the hymen,... ...signs of bruises and even abrasions are present or not? It's a leading question, Your Honour. Rephrase, DPP. Can you explain it again? What were the forms of injuries and the findings... ...while examining the victim in this case? No injuries. Are you sure there were no injuries, doctor? The medical report stated otherwise and your testimony is different. Leading question again, Your Honour. And wise Mr. DPP, are you asking a question or giving a statement? Please, DPP. No more leading questions. Ask your question. I have no further questions. Okay, defence counsel. Cross-examine. With the permission of the court. When you explained about the main report earlier, you stated... ...the victim had just undergone treatment with you. Agree? Agree. Recently, the victim received treatment... ...after giving birth to her child. Can you explain to the court? What treatment did the victim come for? The victim experienced mood swings... ...and we found many signs of post natal depression. And with a thorough inspection,... ...we found out that the victim has a tendency... ...to injure herself, or self-harm. Thank you. With the permission of the court. I am referring to these four pictures. Please mark as IDD 4. Do you agree with me that the injuries in IDD 4... ...are the same injuries confirmed by you? Self-inflicted injuries. And then the victim was diagnosed with... ...postnatal depression. Agree? -Agree. And when you were questioned by the DPP earlier,... ...you stated that there were no hymen injuries,... ...or in other words, injuries that could show... ...that it was indeed sexual coercion... ...that could cause injury. Agree? Objection, sir. This is all speculation. Come on, DPP. That was not a speculation. It was a fact. Your Honour, there was no speculation in the question. Please allow the question. The doctor can answer that question. Agree. No other questions. With the permission of the court. I ask that the witnesses be dismissed. The witness can be dismissed. Thank you. With the permission of the court, I request SP2, the witness,... ...to come to the stand and give her statement. Miss Shiha binti Selamat. -Sure. Call the in SP2. I, Shiha binti Selamat do solemnly, sincerely,... ...and truly declare and affirm... ...that the statement which I shall give... ...in this case shall be the truth. The whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Okay, Shiha. Can you explain to the court,... ...what else did the accused do to you... ...on the night of the incident? He tied me up. He slapped me. He stomped on my stomach. He? Who do you mean by that? Him. No other questions, Your Honour. With the permission of the court. Ms. Shiha, the person you identified... ...is your husband. Agree? Agree. Okay. Throughout your statement,... ...you kept saying that your husband raped you. May I remind you that in Malaysia we have no law... ...for a husband who rapes his wife. Agree? Look at the judge when answering. Don't look at the DPP. Agree or disagree? Agree. You've undergone a medical examination? Agree? -Agree. Okay. We refer to the P3 medical report. According to this medical report,... ...your hymen, let me read this for you,... ...was normal "parous introitus." This means that you had just given birth... ...and the doctor just confirmed that you have postnatal depression. Agree? -I disagree. I have no postnatal depression. -Your Honour. Please, she shouldn't intimidate prosecution's witness. Counsel, please. Calm down. I am obliged, Your Honour. Permission to proceed with the question. Okay. So, you disagree? I disagree. -Let me get this straight. The accused, which is your husband,... ...whom you said had hurt you on the face, body and vagina,... ...but the doctor just confirmed... ...that the injuries were all non-existent. Agree? I disagree! -So, this means... ...you came to court today to try to tell a lie... ...and prosecute your husband,... ...to avoid a charge of attempted suicide... ...because you have already hurt yourself. Agree? -I disagree! I am requesting postponement... ...for a re-examination session, Your Honour. My witness is in an unstable state. The witness will be released for today... ...and will be requested to return... ...for re-examination by the prosecution. I want to remind the accused once again. You can't go near the victim at all times... ...or any witness in your case. And if you are found... ...guilty of violating the terms of this bail,... ...your bail will be revoked... ...and you shall be placed in a remand prison. Do you understand? What are you doing outside this late? Aren't you supposed to be studying or something? No reason. I just want to take some fresh air. Mama taught me that, remember? Fresh air is always good for the mind. Right? Go inside. Aunty said you wanted to paint. But this just seems weird. Assumptions. Okay. If it's not painting,... ...what do you want to do with all the plastic... ...and all this stuff? Miqal, why don't you go to the room? Study or play video games or do something worthwhile. But you always say,... ...there are no secrets in the family. I am the biggest secret. You know that, right? Aunty, what's the matter with mama? She seems weird lately. The garage is lined with plastic. Then, I don't know, she even lifted some heavy boxes. It seems off to me, aunty. You're just the same as my mother. The two of you are hiding something from me, right? So, you are Miqal? Yeah. You can sit anywhere. Yeah. So, you came alone? Or maybe someone... ...together with you? Yes. I came alone. So, no one came here with you? Like an adult? Maybe your family? No one knows. Okay. Miqal. You have to know this. There are procedures here that you have to know. You need to come with someone who's older. Maybe one of your family members. Unless you have something very important to say. So, why don't I just see you next time? Eva. She's your patient, right? So, you are... ...Eva's son? Good talk. You make women love you. Fall in love with you. Have hopes on you. And then... ...you ruin their future in the blink of an eye. Hey. Do you think you're God? You want to decide on my punishments? Hey. The court has already released me. I've been proven innocent, Eva. Eva, Eva, Eva. Eva is weak. She doesn't understand why I want revenge... ...on a disgusting man like you. You're crazy, Eva. Hey. You helped me win that case. And now you want to torture me? This is for the victim who committed suicide... ...after you raped her. This is for the one you insulted and ridiculed... ...after you satisfied yourself. This is for my victory... ...in eliminating disgusting men like you. Nice. Is this the thing you have been building in the garage? What is going on in our house? I am burning the trash, am I not? Somebody needs to take care of the unwanted waste, right? Mike! Seems like I'm the one left to clean up your unwanted waste. Okay. Drink up. At that moment,... ...have you already known or not about what happened? The real events that happened. It's okay, Miqal. You just have to try to remember... ...what actually happened. We need as much information as we can... ...so that we can understand the situation. Only then can we help. Okay. The variance..... Okay. That's a stern gaze. What's going on, Amy? I need to know. Out with it now. What do you mean by that? I didn't do anything. Sweaty palms. Bad posture. Pushing back your glasses every five seconds. Guilty conscience, and you don't tell lies, Amy. It's not me. It's Mike. Mike? Are you telling me... ...that Mike has an affair with a man? Seriously? An affair? Seriously, Elly? What kind of affair? -Miqal told me that he saw... ...either Eva or Mike bringing a man over. Miqal asked if his mum is having an affair? No matter what's going on in this house we need to share among us. But if you guys don't tell me,... ...I can't help all of you in any way. Okay? -Okay. Mama. Mama. Why are there things that humans do just for the sake of winning? For justice? What do you mean by justice? Not all human actions are based on justice. But don't you think... ...that some people do something just to satisfy themselves? Everyone in this life has their own purpose. And for some, it involves the battle within themselves. Eva. I only need Eva. Eva. Eva! I only need Eva! It's me I'll make you a hot chocolate drink, okay? "Another Businessman Missing. An Unsolved Mystery Or Series of Mystery." Hi. Hi, how are you? I'm good. That's right. Here. Thank you, Elly. What were you thinking about? Remember when we first learned silat? Of course. That's when I got to know Mike. Up. Up. Up. Up. Enough. Good. There is progress. Eva. I only have you, you know? Since the event that changed our lives so much. I want you to know... ...that whatever happens to you, I'm always here with you, okay? What about Miqal... ...if anything were to happen to me, Elly? Nothing will happen to you, okay? But you have to go for therapy. Otherwise, your situation will worsen. Not now. We're talking. You know what? The same thing happened this afternoon. I need to tell you... ...because Eva, she's never going to tell you the truth. This thing only happens when,... ...when Miqal is around, okay? Mike is beginning to take control. And I know you're always there for us. I promise I will tell Eva to go for therapy. This is going to be dangerous for us. What did you inject into my body, Eva? You are a jerk, Eva. You lied to me. You deceived me. Then, you took me to this unknown place. Then, I had to listen to that music over and over... ...until my head hurts! What do you want, you jerk? What about my music? I want you to stop that music! It hurts, you jerk! You're the kind of guy who would not understand... ...when women say no. The more they reject you,... ...the more you want it, you jerk. No means no? I get satisfaction... ...from weak women like you. Hey. Women like you..... It's so easy for me, you know? You and your big talk! You never learn, do you? Do you know? It takes twice as much energy... ...to swing and miss than to swing and hit. You know what? We both have one thing in common. We both find pleasure in pain. Hey, you wretched woman. You will feel worse than this. Nice. Sorry, hand. Okay. So..... Okay. Here you go. Nice. What are you doing here, Miqal? Nothing. I just wanted to close the garage door, Mike. Miqal. What's wrong? Let's go downstairs and eat. I've already cooked. What's wrong with you, Miqal? It seems like you've witnessed something. I'm okay, aunty. Go ahead and have dinner first. I'll go downstairs and eat later, okay? Okay. But you know this, right? You can tell me anything. And I will help you at any time. Talk to me, okay? Yeah. Sure. More lies. You were saying? Miqal. Is this enough? Aunty, where's mama? There she is. Were you looking for me? Here's your plate. Thank you. Mama. I went to the garage earlier. But Mike told me to get out. Why, I can't see what's inside... ...our own home garage? Forget it. Aunty. I don't think I'm hungry. Thank you for the food, aunty. Miqal can't know about this. Eva. Do not worry. Nothing can connect us to it. The bull is perfect enough. All organs have been removed before being burned. They're all ashes now. I have covered the garage with plastic. What are you afraid of, Eva? When you were tortured, did anyone care? Did anyone save you? No one. I was the one who saved you. I did. Mike. What saved us was the colourful medicine... ...that we ate for years. Not you. You were only causing trouble for us, you know? Eva! Mama. Miqal. Miqal, stay calm, okay? Listen to me. Go and get mama's medicine. Hurry! Here, take this aunty. Mama. I know, this is not your fault. I know you didn't want all this. I never blamed you all this time. Mama. I love you. I really love you, mama. Have you ever seen this guy? I have. Mike brought him back. Are you sure? I'm sure. Come. Let's have some drinks. Elly, do you know where I can get industrial ice? Those huge chunks of ice. Is it available for sale near here? What are you going to do with industrial ice? No reason. To keep stock. "The Mystery Of The Missing Civil Servant Still Unravelled." What do you want to do with the ice? Just drink up, okay? Miqal. Listen here. Here, you can tell me anything. You can tell me anything and everything, okay? You look uncomfortable. Is there anything you want to tell me? Or something you want to share with me? Doctor. Can you tell me more about my mama? I want you to know this, Miqal. I can't give away any information... ...about my patients,... ...even to immediate family members. I'm so sorry, Miqal. But doctor,... ...her condition is getting worse. We need to help her. What did you do to me? What did you do to me? What is all this? Just like what you did... ...to all the women you deceived and raped. First, you undress them. Then, you satisfy your lust, right? Just like you,... ...I don't like my victims to move... ...while I'm having fun. So, stop moving... ...already! You are not a lawyer, right? You are not a psycho. You are just really sick. Then, what are you? An angel in human skin? I'm a man in a devil's mask. You pretend as if you belong in heaven. But you use women to satisfy your lust. You, this thing that you're doing now,... ...you will be dragged to hell. Your father will not approve. -Shut up! In our body, there are femoral arteries... ...that branch from your mid-abdomen... ...to each thigh. Among the biggest vessels in the body. Which means the more you struggle,... ...the more blood you will lose. Or in other words,... ...you can lose all the blood in your body... ...in three minutes the moment I pull this knife. How does it feel? I'm puzzled. I don't understand. Why did you handle my case? Why are you doing this to me? You can't accept the fact? Because... ...criminals don't die by the hands of law. They die by the hands of others. But I guess, when you were a child,... ...your parents didn't give you enough love. Maybe you can't wait to go to hell with me. You are one sick jerk. And so will the fan and ice beneath you. And as extreme duress begins... ...to shut down all brain activities,... ...and decrease your heart rate,... ...you will no longer feel pain. And when you start dozing off,... ...I will wake you up like this... ...so that you can enjoy every ounce of pain. Have fun. I want you to stop the music, damn it! Miqal. What are you looking for? Miqal. Take a deep breath. Tell me what you're looking for. Aunty, I have no time to take a deep breath. I need to find that file, aunty! Aunty. Where's mama? Aunty! We need to find mama. We need to find answers that she hide from us. Mama is sick, aunty. We need to help her. What has she been hiding all this while in that garage? Who did she bring back? What Mike and Amy... ...burnt in that cage? Miqal, you are over-thinking. Calm down, dear. Wait. This is impossible. You need to tell me what we should do now. Just like how you did when we were kids. If it weren't for you all this time, I would have... ...lost my way. I really need you now, Elly. Elly, did you listen to what I said? Daddy. Please, Elly! Elly, please! We need to continue with this plan, Eva. What we've been doing all this time is the best way... ...to teach those jerks. We're not doing this for us. But for justice. Have you forgotten... ...what that darn man had done to you? Our own daddy. He's the reason we're like this. But if you want to talk about revenge,.... ...I think we can stop now. We have taught all the men a lesson, right? And guys, Miqal suspects something. And he's looking for answers, Elly. We can't stop. After what Elly did for you all this while... ...you want to forget her help just like that? Don't worry about Miqal. I will handle it. What we're doing now... ...is for the sake of Miqal too, Eva. No. I don't agree. We can't go on like this. We need to stop, Elly. Have you forgotten who saved you? Have you forgotten, Eva? Aunty! Aunty! Aunty! Please, aunty! Aunty, stop! Aunty! Please, stop! You both owe me your lives. We have to be professional. Court, all rise. Sit down. The case that was recalled,... ...45C-610-2022... ...and 45C-710-2022. Eva Sulaiman and Ellyana Sulaiman. After perusing the entire evidence,... ...the arguments put forward,... ...and assessing the statement as a whole,... ...at the end of the defence case,... ...the court has made the following findings. Ms. Ellyana Sulaiman,... ...the court thinks that the defence had failed... ...to raise reasonable doubt towards the prosecution case. Therefore, the court finds you guilty... ...and you're convicted with the charges... ...under Section 302 of the Penal Code... ...in conjunction with Section 34 of the Penal Code... ...and can be hung to death. The date of the conviction will be set later. Ms. Eva Sulaiman. The court after hearing the overall case.... ...and made a total assessment ...at the end of the defense case, we've decided that,... ...during each date of the incident,... ...you do not know and are not conscious. Unsound mind. In which you are incapable... ...of knowing that your deeds... ...are acts that goes against the law. And this was confirmed by the psychiatrist's report... ...from both the prosecution and defence. With this, the court... ...has decided that you... ...will need to be placed... ...based on the provisions of Section 348 (2)... ...of the Criminal Procedure Code,... ...read in conjunction with Section 347,... ...of the Criminal Procedure Code,... ...in a mental health institution... ...until ordered otherwise... ...by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Court, all rise. Elly. I'm sorry, Elly. Elly. Don't! Elly. Wait. Let her see her family first. You've always caused me trouble since you were a kid, Eva. When dad brimmed with lust for you, who was the one who saved you? Who protected you? Me! Now, you're the one who killed,... ...but I'm the one who's going to prison? You're just the same. Illegitimate child. Elly. Please. Please do something! Elly! Elly! Don't! Please, Elly! Elly! Hi. Hi, Miqal. I'm Anna. And Eva wants me to tell you... ...that she loves you so much... ...even if she's too shy to tell to you, okay? And she wants you to know,... ...even if she got you the wrong way,... ...but it's okay. You are Eva's child in this world and the hereafter. And she wants me to tell you that... ...she loves you. Thank you for saving her, okay? Anna. -Yes? Please tell her... ...that I love her so much. Okay? -Okay. She loves you too. She loves you too, okay?
