How did you find the frogs at pollard slough, sir? Quite well, thank you, torque. Quite well, but very uncommunicative. Uncommunicative, he says. As if the frogs were likely to tell him anything they knew. Why don't you have Millie do that, miss judd? That's a maid's work, not a housekeeper's. You needn't answer because I know the reason. That spot under your hand is blood, and you didn't want anyone to know. = blood? Ridiculous. Yes, it is ridiculous. It couldn't be blood, but it is. I've seen those spots before, and I've seen you trying to scrub them out because you knew what they were. Blood, the whole house reeks of it. The air is charged with death and hatred and something that's unclean. Oh, come to your room and rest, Ms. ingston. Keep your hands off me. You're not my keeper. No, of course not. You're just a little overwrought, that's all. Come along. That's not what you mean. You want me to believe that I'm insane. I'm not insane, am I, miss judd, not really insane? No more insane than the rest of us. = the rest of us? How many of us are sane? You wouldn't know, but I shall soon. I've sent to the city of a psychiatrist. - A psychiatrist? - The very best, Dr. Harper. Get to the phone, and cancel the call immediately. = it's too late. Even you couldn't stop him. He's motoring down, and there's no way to reach him. You must stop him. Your brother sent for his own doctors. Oh no, he mustn't. Oh, I've got to see him... No no no, it's useless. They're coming by the next train. Laurie's going to the station to meet them. = you know what that will mean. You won't admit it, but you know! Stop it, Margaret. Oh, but they'll believe all... You're talking too much! Go to your room! I said, go to you room! Hello Sadie, this is Millie Carson. Get me the constable"s office, will ya? Yeah, cap beggs, if he's in, uh-huh. Hello cap? Say listen, there's a lotta funny business going on out here that I think you oughta look into before it's too late. What? Oh, this is Millie, out at. What was the idea of that? You know it is contrary to orders for servants to use the phone for their personal affairs. There was nothing very personal about what I was going to say. Moreover, it is extremely bad form to gossip about your employers. If I did my duty, I'd dismiss you on the spot. Well, you needn't bother, I'm quitting. = you can't do that. Not without giving notice. After what I've seen and heard around this asylum? Try and stop me. What is it you think you have seen and heard? As if you don't know better than I do. You're not going till I find out what sort of slander you intend to spread about honest folk. Let her alone, Rolf. He can't stop you from quittin' if you wanna. Remember your place, Laurie. I happen to be in charge of this household. Sure, sure, sure, sure. This is the way I win my women, savin' 'em from butlers. Turn her loose. I'll drop you off in town, kid. Go get your stuff. Thanks, I'll call for it later. You know, of course, I must report you to Mr. ingston. Do that and see what it gets you. Him and me understand one another. Rolf. It might be wise to say nothing of this to Mr. ingston. Say, where'd Mr. ingston collect all that menagerie he has around him anyhow? Whaddya mean, torque? Yeah, torque and those man-eating dogs and that crystal-gazer, and that Butler looks like something you'd find under a wet rock. And his housekeeper, and his sister. Say, she hasn't got all her buttons, has she? = search me. But what about yours truly? Anything wrong with me? You oughta know. What is it you think's goin' on back there? If you don't know, you wouldn't believe me, and if you don't know, I'd be wasting my time. But I'm sure gonna hand cap beggs and earful. It might not be healthy to talk too much about what you think you know. Healthy. Okay. Don't say I didn't tell ya. What's this for, as if I didn't know? How is it dames always know what's on a guy's mind before he knows himself? You read the confession magazine. Now wait a minute, there's nothing really wrong with me. Nothin' a good case of rigor mortis wouldn't cure. = oof! - Dr. king. - Well, hello phipps. It's good to see you, again. How are you, Dr. Timmons? How do you do? What are you two doing here? Are they holding a medical convention in hillsdale? No no no, we're going to ingston towers. Kurt ingston, you know. Ingston towers, that's where I'm going. They're supposed to have a car for me here. Perhaps that's it. = must be. It's the only one in sight. Is this by any chance the car from the towers? Yeah, this is it. Still in glands, I suppose, phipps. Of course, fascinating little structures. Oh, well by the way, I performed an interesting experiment last week the journal intends to publish. There was a mother that... Don't tell me now, let me read about it in the journal. Oh forget it, Millie, forget it. It's too flimsy. I can't act until something really happens. Well, wouldn't you say something had happened when they found doc Kramer murdered out at pollard slough? Pollard slough ain't on ingston property. Well, it's right in back of it. And there's something unnatural about that killing, too. That's right, the doc was strangled, but there was a big blood spot right beside him. Oh, he probably wounded whoever attacked him. Anyway, he ain't got no connection with the towers. Oh, all right. But I'm going out there and get my things. I wouldn't spend another night there if I owned the place. Ain't you 'fraid to go out there alone, Millie? It'll be dark, you know, the time you get there. Don't worry, I'm not going out there alone. Jeb's driving me. - Huh? I didn't say we'd go out there tonight. Well now, there's nothing to be afraid of. Cap just said so himself. Oh, I ain't scared. Eh? Well, I just don't like the frogs out around that slough. It sounds like you heard about what's been seen walkin' around that slough foggy nights, and how even the frogs quit croakin' when it shows up. Oh bosh, I don't believe none of that granny talk. Well then, let's get started. And let's stop by my house, I wanna get my cape. Goodbye. If you will follow me please, I will show you to your rooms. Which one of you is Dr. Harper? None of us is Dr. Harper. Dr. king, Dr. phipps. My name is Timmons, miss... Ingston. I was expecting Dr. houndston. Well, you better go to your room, dear. But I wanted to see Dr. Harper before... But Dr. Harper's not here, you better go upstairs. = you'll let me know when he arrives? = of course. If you will excuse me. Miss ingston's not been herself lately. You no doubt recognize the symptoms. I think we understand, nerves. Glands, Dr. Timmons, definitely glands. This way, gentlemen. Are we to see Mr. ingston? Mr. ingston will join you at dinner, sir. Oh, it's you. Yes, I've come for my things, if you don't mind. It's a pleasure. Uh, you walked all the way out here through the fog alone? No, Jeb harmon's waiting down at the gate to take me home. Oh, I see. Yes, yes, I'll tell him. You may as well leave, Mr. harmon. Millie's decided to spend the night here. = there must be some mistake. You couldn't pay her to spend another night here. She must've changed her mind. Did she talk to you herself? No, it sounded more like the Butler's voice. Well, lemme come in and talk to her myself. I gave you her message, that ends the matter. Goodnight, Mr. harmon. = but listen! Still can't see why Jeb ran off without leaving word. Very inconsiderate, miss, very inconsiderate. Hello there, in trouble? Yes, my car broke down. Would you mind giving me a lift? Sure, where to? Well, I was going to the ingston towers, but... You're practically there. Is that your car I passed back there? Yes, I'm afraid I'm not much of a mechanic. How come you're walking toward it instead of away from it? Well, I gave up in disgust and started to walk, but I heard a scream, and I might add it didn't take me very long to turn around and go back. A scream in the night through the fog on pollard slough. Tell me more. It didn't seem funny to me. Mm? What was it? Oh, I won't go into that. Must've been my imagination. What's ingston like? Oh, he's practically a recluse. He never sees anybody except doctors. I'm about the only one of the local characters he even lets hear the place. = you in medicine? No worse, I write horry-gories. = you write what? You know, whodunits. Oh. Sounds like a nice way to earn your living. Who said I earned a living? This fog seems to seep through and creep right into your bones. Do either of you any idea why we're here at the towers? Answering the call of the great god gold, I suppose, what else? I don't think I follow you. Ingston"s been pretty lavish with his donations to medicine lately. And speaking for myself, I could use a new research laboratory. So, well we really need a new wing at the hospital. How 'bout you, Timmons? I'd rather not joke on the subject, if you don't mind. Sorry, old man, no offense. Oh, I'm unreasonably sensitive about our profession, I suppose. As a matter of fact, when ingston phoned, he implied he is about to make a big contribution to medicine. And who's more eligible than we three, who attended him amid his major illness. And left him a helpless cripple. Well, we did all that medical science possibly could. Well, our best wasn't enough. He had everything to live for. Wealth, position, friends, and we left him a misshapen thing that must hide even from the servants in the house. I still say we did all that medical science could have done. Then we are like blind men groping in the dark. If we don't know our job, then why don't we quit and make way for someone who does? Snap out of it, Timmons. Every doctor worthy of the name feels that way at times. = not me. Personally, I feel we're doing great work. And if I were ingston, I doubt if I could ever forgive any one of us. Who is it? = dick Baldwin. Who's with you? Dr. Harper. Aren't you pretty young to be a famous doctor? = who said I was famous? None but the renowned ever entered these portals. If you care to wait in the library, I will tell Mr. ingston you are here. - So we will. - Thank you. Hello, dick. Hello, Mr. ingston. Where have you been keeping yourself for the past week? In New York, publisher trouble. Is that Mr. ingston? = what's left of him. Oh, well didn't they like your story? No, not very much. Not very much, what's wrong with it? A masterpiece of horror! I didn't sleep for two nights. Put me down, Laurie, put me down. Yes, dick, I. Who's that? I'm Dr. Harper, the psychiatrist you sent for. Psychiatrist? I didn't send for any psychiatrist. If I may explain, sir, I believe it was miss Margaret who sent for Dr. Harper. Margaret? She sent for a psychiatrist? Well. That's the most encouraging symptom she's shown, isn't it, Rolf? I really couldn't say, sir. When a person questions her own sanity, it's a good signs he's not for from normal, isn't it? Well, I'm afraid that's a rather overrated theory, Mr. ingston. Overrated or not, it sounds encouraging to me. Oh, pardon me, Dr. Harper, my I present agor Singh. He's something of a mentalist himself in his own way, in his own sphere. - How do you do? - How do you do? Rolf will show you to you room, then you will honor us by joining us at dinner. Thank you. If I were your age, dick, I think I'd turn into a driveling neurotic and send for Dr. Harper immediately. Haven't you noticed the symptoms? Begging your pardon, miss, but dinner is about to be served. - I'll only be a moment. - Thank you. Well, if it's not my three old friends from the hospital cart and operating table. Welcome to the towers. By George, is it good to see you looking so well. Glands must be functioning perfectly. Perfectly, Dr. phipps, perfectly. Well, it's good to see you, Timmons. I'm sorry I can't offer the cordial handshake but it might be a bit gruesome. Please, Mr. ingston, we feel bad enough as it is. Don't be ridiculous, Timmons, you did all medical science could do for me. Just what I was saying this evening. Of course, of course. You know, I don't think you've ever been properly rewarded. But you will be. You will be. Gentlemen, may I present agor Singh, a resident of the towers, and dick Baldwin, a neighbor and frequent visitor. I'm glad to know you, sir. Thank you, doctor. Dr. Harper, just a minute. I'm Sarah judd, the housekeeper and miss ingston's companion. I see, I'm afraid you've been rather badly imposed upon. In what way? Well, when I told miss ingston you'd arrived, she grew very excited. She said she didn't want to see you. That often happens in such cases. = she even went so far as to ask that you leave the towers tonight. And I'm not at all sure that it might not be for the best. Well thank you, but I couldn't even if I wanted to. You see, my car broke down, and there's no train until morning. Oh. Beg your pardon. Excuse me. If I were you, I'd confine my attention to servant girls. Eh, you mean me and you, eh? How dare you? Well why not? You know, you can't afford to be too choosy. And besides, think what you might be missin'. What is it, Dr. Timmons? Something seems to have startled you. Why, I was under the impression that, well, that. That both of my arms are paralyzed. As a matter of fact, they are, just as you disciples of hippocrates left them. Well, uh, how are you able to use them as you do? Money and a local mechanic were able to supply me with something outside the range of medicine. A few steel bars, electric wires, and dry cells. I would like to examine that before we leave. It may be of use to some others similarly afflicted. = you won't leave the towers without having a talk with me, will you? No, of course not, I'll go now if you like. Margaret, you're being very inconsiderate of our guests. I'm sorry. I only wanted a few minutes with Dr. Harper. You are Dr. Harper, aren't you? Yes, I'm Dr. Harper. Sit down, come have dinner with us, Margaret. Oh no, please. I've already had dinner in my room. Dr. Harper hasn't. I'll just be a few minutes. Then we'll talk as long as you like. Thank you. Now then gentlemen, if you'll resume your seats, I believe we are safe from any further invasion. When we got to the place where we found doc Kramer, the frogs stopped a-croakin', and then... Oh, I know, I know, I know. You've told me all that before. Ti still don't believe it. All right, all right, don't believe it. But when I got back home, I called the towers to talk to Millie and she wasn't there. Now, if she started back along that slough road, there's no tellin'... No tellin' but what she's home in bed right now. Well, you can find out by callin' her pa. = hello? Oh Sadie, say, see if you can raise anyone out at the Sam Carson house, will you? I know you're all curious as to why I brought you together here at the towers. But if you come into the library, I think your Patience will be amply rewarded. Where are you going? To miss ingston"s room as I promised. Oh, that can wait until after my little party. Please don't make me insist. Very well. I think miss ingston had better wait in her room. Even the mildest form of excitement is bad for her. I'm sure I'll be all right with Dr. Harper. = of course. Splendid, splendid. Ingston towers. Who, beggs? No sir. Millie quit this afternoon without notice. Yes, sir, she came out this evening for her things and left immediately. Wait a minute, wait a minute, who is this? Who's talking? Oh, the Butler. Oh, thank you. Say, that's funny. Millie ain't home yet, and the Butler there, he says she left the tower. = the Butler. Why it was him that sent me away without her. Said she'd changed her mind. Hey, maybe we had better take a ride out the slough road. - Yeah. - Come on. As I said earlier this evening, I'm about to make a contribution to the art of healing, a method above and beyond anything employed by medical science today. There is method of healing above and beyond the science of modern medicine. = this one is. If you'd known it when you attended me, I believe the results would've been happier for us all. If you don't mind, Mr. ingston, your repeated reference to our failure is... I'm truly sorry, Dr. Timmons, I only mentioned it by way of illustration. Is this process of yours by any chance based on glandular functioning? = no. It's a method by which man can grow new tissues at will, replace entire organs, perhaps, as much as a lobster can grow a new claw to replace one he has lost in battle. Extraordinary. A new discovery of your own? = of course not. I learned it from agor Singh during the months he's been here at the towers. I thought so. And since when is yogism accepted as a science? = it has been known as a science to the people of my faith for ages before there was such a thing as a doctor. Well, if I've been dragged down here merely to witness the cheap sideshow tricks of a charlatan, I beg to be excused. Why? As long as you're here, you may as well say and see it through. On the contrary. The powers I demonstrate can be used for evil as well as good. It might be unwise to explain them to Dr. king. I resent that, if it didn't give me such an admirable excuse to leave. Good night. - Oh, Dr. king. - Eh? = just a second. Have you had a basal metabolism lately, doctor? = of course not. = know what? Some little gland is playing tricks with your disposition. Before you undertake your demonstration, it might be well to explain the principle involved. = modern science now admits what my people have known for centuries. Namely that all material, everything, is composed of a single basic essence. For want of a better name, they call it cosmic substance. All matter is really cosmic substance in vibration. Change the rate of vibration, and you change the kind of matter. This much, your science admits. But the very next step, they will not accept. By sheer will power, a trained mind can alter those vibrations, ves, he can even reduce an object to its basic elements and then reassemble those elements in another place. Let me show you. Oh, would you help me with chair? = yeah. - Rolf, the lights, please. - Yes, sir. Will you help me with this, sir? Right here? Thank you. I impose only one condition, absolute silence. = look. That's blood, dripping from the hands. That's impossible. = but there is. You're right. Let's see what's in this. A perfect pigeon blood Ruby. There's an inscription on there, it's in ancient Greek. Something about the curse of death. Dr. Harper, come back here. Dr. Harper, I want you in here! The Ruby"s gone! = so is the skeleton. = he's fainted. Turn on the lights and get some water. Mr. ingston are you in the habit of ordering your guests around in that tone? It's not a matter of ordering my guests around, my dear child, as a scientist, I thought you might be interested in the demonstration. Would you mind rolling me a little closer to the group, please? I'm all right now. Well gentlemen, what do you think? Just exactly what happened? The skeleton came from a tomb in sicily. I dematerialized it and rematerialized it here. I held it by a force of will. Then someone shouted, and it broke my concentration of holding the elements together here. Now do you believe this method could be used to rebuild wasted tissue? Seems possible. That is, if Mr. Singh's explanation is the correct one. What other explanation is there? Well, it could be mass hypnotism like the disappearing rope trick. It could be, but it isn't. Did you notice the blood dripping from the hands? = yeah. = look. How is it that the blood didn't dematerialize with the rest? There are certain details in the process that we are not allowed to explain to the uninitiated. Same kind of blood splotch we found by doc Kramer's body. = where'd it come from?? She wasn't wounded, she was strangled, just like the doc was. It don't add up. Careful, now. Now where are we going to find a man who leaves bare footprints the size of these? As far as I'm concerned, I don't wanna find him. Me neither, but we got to. They seem to lead right towards ingston's gate. Let's see what's on the other side. - Me too? - Yep, you too. Yeah, another footprint headed right towards the gate. Ah, it's locked on the inside, hm. Looks like we better have a talk with the ingstons. Yeah, sure enough. While you're doin' that, I'll drive Millie back to town. Scared, Jeb? From your study of the mind, Singh's explanation of his little demonstration must seem even more fantastic to you than to the rest of us. My study of the mind has only convinced me how very little we know of its powers. Surely you don't believe we actually saw what we thought we saw. It isn't that I believe, exactly. It's more as if a quiet little voice is saying to me, could be. You must admit it's pretty hard to laugh off that blood splotch on the carpet. = yeah. It's still there. And it still looks damp. I have an uneasy feeling we haven't heard the last of that demonstration. You sound as if you were afraid. =t think I am. What are you afraid of? = t don't know. That's what makes it so awful. I felt it the moment I stepped foot in this house. Ti feel like a child afraid of the dark. Then I'll arrange with Rolf to spend the night. Who says the age of chivalry's dead? Oh no, that won't be necessary. A psychiatrist calling for help because she's afraid of the dark is a little silly, isn't it? You know, I think I like the idea of your being afraid, better than being a psychiatrist. Why? Oh, I don't know. You seem like a girl that'd put 100% into anything she went into. Assuming you're right. Don't you see, if you devote all your time and energy to being a doctor, how am I going to have a chance to. Oh, I thought you'd be alone. Oh, miss ingston, wait. Mr. Baldwin was just leaving, weren't you, dick? Apparently I was. Goodnight, doctor, see you in the morning, early I hope. I'll be looking forward to it. Good night, miss ingston. Goodnight. Oh, I'm afraid I shouldn't have come here. They'll find out, and... Ah, no one's going to find out. And if they do, there's nothing to be afraid of. Now, you sit right here. And what was it that you wanted to tell me? I'm afraid it's going to be more difficult to tell you than I thought. You'll find it easier if you don't look directly at me. But first, did you send miss judd to tell me well no, of course not. = t didn't think so. Do you know any reason why she might want to get rid of me? Yes. She's been my brother's housekeeper for years, long before his illness. T think she was in love with him. She would do anything to keep him from being hurt. I can't see why my being here would hurt him. It may depend on whether or not you think I'm sane. Do you? Well, I suppose none of this is entirely sane on all subjects, why do you ask? Well, there is a trace of insanity in our family. Lately, I've seen things my reason told me couldn't be real. What sort of things? Half a dozen times, I thought I've seen great splotches of blood on the carpets. That's not impossible. We all saw one here in this room tonight. Miss judd insists they were not blood. Well, if that's all that's worrying you... Oh, but it isn't. It's what I've seen prowling about the grounds on foggy nights, keeping to the shadows and disappearing when they thought someone was coming. When did you first see it? =t don't remember. But the last time was at our gate in the back wall. As it passed through, the frogs stopped croaking. That was the night they found Dr. Kramer in the slough, murdered. I'm beginning to think you're not the victim of your imagination, miss ingston. Can you describe the appearance of what you saw? Oh, as clearly as if it were in this room. It had a hideously distorted face. It might've been any age, but somehow I got the impression is was just about. Miss ingston. Your brother sent me to tell you to go to bed. Miss ingston and I haven't finished our discussion yet. I'm to see she goes to her room if I have to carry her. Then I'll go with you. Mr. ingston says she is to go alone. = it will be better for both of us if I do what he says. Goodnight, Dr. Harper. Goodnight. She ain't as crazy as most people think. - No? - Uh-uh. She's been talkin' too much, and you're scared. Why do you say that? = t know. And I don't blame you. Anything could happen in this morgue, and nobody'd be any wiser. - Really? - Uh-huh. What kind of things? =t ain't tellin' all I know. But you don't need to be afraid. I'll see that nothin' happens to you. You're very kind. Aw, forget it. I don't feel that way about most dames, but you're kinda different. Maybe it's that doctor you got hung on your name. = dick. I thought you'd gone home. I was on my way, but the local constabulary met me at the gate and brought me back. Captain beggs wants to talk to you, Laurie. Yeah? What about? He'll tell you what it's about. Here is Laurie, sir. - Turn up the lights. - Yes, sir. Hey, don't go away, I might want ya. Did you know Millie Carson come out here tonight? Sure, I was in the kitchen at the time. Did you phone the gateman she was going to stay all night? Why would I do a thing like that? I'll ask the questions. Go ahead, you can answer 'em, too. You'll answer, or I'll take you down and throw you in the jail. = you and who else? = just me. Now, did you phone the gateman? - No. - Well, somebody did. Well, why pick on me? Maybe he done it. Already asked him. = his word's no better than mine. Maybe it is. He didn't have a row with her this afternoon the way that you did. Hey, what's this all about? We just found Millie's body in the slough, she's been murdered. = oh. And because I had a scrap with her, you're tryin' to say I done it, eh? Well, that's crazy. Maybe it is, maybe it ain't. Sit and take off your shoe. What for? Nevermind what for, just do it. Er. Hey, wait a, what. Where'd you get that mud on there? Oh, I went down the road after Dr. Harper's car. The gardener was there. What time was that? I don't know, they was eatin' supper. That's right, sir. = hm. = what's that for? That's the length of the footprint we found right where Millie's body was. Give us your foot here, come on. Oh. Well, that kinda clears me, doesn't it? Yes, I'm afraid it does, for the time bein'. Hey, there's plenty other guys around here with feet. Why don't you measure them? =t aim to. Have all the men in the house come down here right away. I'm afraid they have retired, sir. Couldn't the investigation wait until morning? Yes, it could, but it ain't going to. Yes, sir. About Mr. ingston, there's no point to disturb him? = no. Hey, you better send old frozen face down here. She must wear size 10 at least. Who's frozen face? Miss judd, the housekeep. I can't imagine her running around in her bare feet. Eh, yeah. Well. I'm sorry to disturb you, doctor, but the police request your presence in the library. = police? Yes, the local constable, it's quite serious. - I'll be right there. - Excuse me, please. You are wanted in the library, Dr. phipps. Police matter. Police matter? = yes. I'm instructed to get you. All right, just as soon as I get a robe. Dr. king? You better come along too, doctor. What's the meeting of all this commotion? Miss ingston must be allowed to sleep. Do you hear what I say? You're the only one makin' any noise, shut up! How dare you! He's been strangled. Laurie, take her, will ya? Get her out of here. Horrible way his face is twisted, those eyes. He was paralyzed with fright. Doctor, if he was strangled, what's that blood doing here? Hey look, look here. There's a trail of it goes right up there to that door. Excuse me, please. What did you find in there? = nothin'. Yes there is. There's a big spot of blood. Yes, just like the one the skeleton left. = what skeleton? The one Igor Singh materialized in the library. = didn't I hear a scream? Yes, sir. "Twas miss judd when she saw Dr. king. Dr. king, what's happened to him? = he's been murdered. = murdered? Did you say Dr. King has been murdered? Yes, sir. And I've been expecting something like this will happen. Really? Why? That skeleton, sir, and the Ruby, the curse of death. I demand that you arrest this creature. No, no, he couldn't have killed Dr. king. I didn't say he killed anybody, but I do say... All it want to know is who killed Dr. king. Now, down the library, all ya. I know nothing of such matters, but is it necessarily true that the man who left the footprint in the mud is Dr. king's murderer? Couldn't the footprint have been made before the girl drowned? Listen, I got problems enough already without you thinkin' up any new ones. You can go. Nonsense, doctor. There are many such curses on the record. The king tut curse, for instance? Yes, but that's only one of many. Personally, I'm rather skeptical of those curses, and for substantial reasons. What reasons? Well, I was with an auden expedition, and I'm still alive. Think I'll turn in, are you coming? = not me. And you're crazy if you go upstairs alone. Ah. If there is anything in those curses, I'm living on borrowed time anyhow. Goodnight. - Goodnight. I thought I told you to get some sleep. I thought I told you I was afraid of the dark. Well, don't let that throw you, you got plenty of company. I'm glad of that. I'm also glad captain beggs wouldn't let you go home. Don't be silly, you couldn't hire me to spend the night by myself, much less make the trip from here to my place in the dark. Nice of you to pretend you're afraid. I'm not pretending, sister, if you will pardon the familiarity. You know, I think miss ingston could throw some light on Dr. king's murder. Miss ingston? No, I'm afraid Margaret isn't entirely rational. = that's what someone wants to believe. Actually, she's the sanest one in this house. What are we waiting for, let's talk to her. No, I'm afraid to. Might lead to her death, too. As that mad chauffeur said a while ago, anything could happen in this place. Well you be sure and keep them dogs locked up, torque. I don't want 'em biting anymore undertakers. Well, looks like you've taken charge of my home. Yep. It looks like I'm gonna stay in charge until I clear up this murder. Naturally, naturally. The whole thing's fantastic. Have they discovered anything? Nope, nothin' but a corpse. Well, nobody's gonna make a slaughterhouse outta my home and get away with it. Come into the library. All right, Laurie, all right. Oh, good morning, Dr. Harper. Good morning, Mr. ingston. - Good morning, dick. - Morning, Mr. ingston. Has miss ingston come down for breakfast yet? I think she's on her way down now. Oh, I'd like to see her, if you excuse me. See you later. Eh, certainly. Dick, you're always writing about things like this. Who do you think this homicidal maniac is? =t don't know much about real crimes. In my stories, it's always the one you least expect. Well, that would be me, wouldn't it? Yes, I'm afraid it would. Well then, I guess we better forget about fiction and deal with this as a real crime. Good morning, miss ingston. May I have a word with you after breakfast, alone. Why aren't you in uniform? = uniform? = of course. All of our servants wear uniforms. Go get into yours, please. Oh, yes of course, miss ingston. It was human blood, all right. Dr. phipps analyzed it. Yes, but whose? Where'd it come from? = skeletons don't bleed. = he's murdered. = who's murdered? Dr. Timmons, up in his room. Strangled, the same as king. And the same splotch of blood. Well, as far as I'm concerned, this settles it. Does anybody know how that fella Singh keeps himself? Were you looking for me? = yeah. I got to arrest you for the murder of king and Timmons. I assure you, I had nothing to do with either of the crimes. Well, you better hang onto that assurance of yours. You'll need it for the judge. May I ask, what evidence do you expect to produce? Plenty. I heard all about that hocus pocus you performed last night. That's good enough for me. Possibly. But aren't you likely to be laughed out of court when you try to convince the jury about anything so fantastic? I'm afraid he's right, cap. Yeah, but I got to arrest someone. Give me a little time, and I think I can produce the guilty party. = you know who done it? Yes, I'm afraid so. But I prefer not to act, I can prove it. He's a queer critter. Give me a hand with Timmons, please. = yeah. = come in. I'm sorry to break in on you like this, lynne, but if you think miss ingston knows anything about these murders, you've got to persuade her to talk. Dick I told you, I don't dare. She won't be safe if she tells. You can't think about that now, Timmons is dead. = Timmons?? Yes, and there's no telling how many more will go if we don't do something. All right, we'll try. Well? We'd like to speak to miss ingston a moment, please. Miss ingston's asleep. Why did you do that? You knew I wasn't asleep. They didn't. = we better wait in here until judd leaves and then try again. Look, doc. You gotta scram outta here. What for? Well, can't you see? You're gonna be next. Why do you say that? Do you know something? = nevermind what I know. You oughta be able to see it for yourself. Now look, here's a house full of people, and who's being killed? Doctors, Dr. king, Dr. Timmons, not to mention old doc Kramer. You're next, I know. What about Dr. Harper? Ah, she's no doctor, she's just a dame. = how about this Millie? Was she a doctor, too? She just knew too much. I told her not to blow her top, but she wouldn't listen to me. I can't get out while that corn crib constable is watching. Listen doc, just pack your stuff, and I'll smuggle you out right after dark, you see? You better lock this door till you hear me knock. Like that. Mr. ingston has been asking for you rather impatiently. Yeah? In his room? Certainly. = oh. She's gone, but she locked the door. Maybe the key to this door'll work. = that's an idea. Worth a try, anyhow, come on. Margaret, we have very little time, so I'll get right to the point. I think you know who killed those doctors. You've got to tell us in order to prevent other deaths. I can't, I can't do that. Please, Margaret, you must. We've no time to lose. You don't know what you're asking. I'm afraid I know more than you suspect. I think I saw the same thing you did. Oh no, you couldn't have. That man I saw in the fog last night, is the man who killed Millie and Timmons and king. That man's your brother. Well, you shouldn't have told me. I'd rather believe I was insane. But you sent for me, didn't you? Because of his strange behavior? Yes. Yes, I suppose I did. I couldn't tell you after Dr. king. Kurt ingston. That's not possible, the man's paralyzed, I'm positive. I don't know how he does it, but it's ingston, all right. I recognized him when I saw Laurie carrying him down the stairs. Yes, but why, what possible motive would he have to kill those people? Well, since you know a part, you may as well know all of it. He's brooded over his condition till he's not sane. He blames his doctors because he's so pitifully crippled. He invited them here so he could do away with them. Even though I know this, I can't prove it. If he's only pretending to be paralyzed, that can be proved. The important thing now is to have beggs get phipps out of here before it's too late. Dick, let me have the key. = here. = you better lock the door after we leave. I'll go find beggs, you tell Dr. phipps to get ready. Listen cap, I've got some news for you that's gonna set you right back... Dick! Back here, hurry! = sounds like I'm too late. You better wait in your room, lynne. This isn't going to be pleasant. Strangled, just like the others. And blood that comes from nowhere. Wait a minute. Funny. This blood leads right over to the wall. Whatever left that blood went through this wall. Heh, couldn't go through there, it's solid. Nevertheless, it did. Look at this, cap, hm? Well, dog my cats. Sure enough, look a that. The trail leads right along the floor. Hey, you know, this time I got an idea we'll find something worth findin'. Nothin' but another puddle of blood. Yep, just like all the others. It all seemed to start with that skeleton of agor singhs. You know, that's good enough for me. I'm going to arrest that hindu if I never see the bag of money. You'll have the wrong man, cap. Whaddya mean, do you think you've really found out something? Yes, the man you want is Kurt ingston. Oh fiddlesticks, this is no time for joking. I'm not joking, his sister told me. = how could she know? She's as crazy as a hootie owl. Dr. Harper says she's sane. Dr. Harper also says that just about the time Millie was killed, she saw Kurt ingston walking down by the slough. Well, whaddya know. How could it be ingston, he can't walk. I think if you'll examine him, you'll find he's no more paralyzed than I am. Hm, well best way to find out would be to go have a talk with him, eh? = come in! Well, well it's about time someone came to see how I'm getting along. This ain't exactly a social call, Mr. ingston. = don't tell me there's been another. Who? - Dr. phipps. Phipps, strangled like the others? Yes, and a trail of blood that leads through a secret panel in his room. Secret panel in this house? Mm-hm. Whoever did it seems to know the house pretty thoroughly. Phipps. By the great lord Harry, I'd give my last rotten dollar to be able to get out of this bed. There's them that says you can, Mr. ingston when you have a mind to. So, I see you managed to talk to my sister, in spite of miss judd. No, I ain't, dick hasn't. I thought it was an open secret that Margaret wasn't entirely responsible mentally. Dr. Harper says she is. She also says that she saw you walking last night, just about the time Millie was murdered. So you believe I can really walk? It'd be a very easy thing to pretend to be paralyzed. It looks as if you've got me there. I'm not really paralyzed, but I've let people think I am. Ah, it looks like that settles things, don't it, huh? I'll let you be a judge of that. Will you please turn back the covers? I preferred to have people think I was paralyzed rather than just half a man. I don't know to apologize, Mr. ingston. I guess I let my imagination run away with me. Forget it. But if I were you, I'd get Dr. Harper out of this house and back to the city. I'm going to, just as soon as cap'll let me. This ain't a very good time for you to be askin' favors, young fella. Let's get back downstairs, go on, get goin'. I'm sorry I let him make a fool outta me. You didn't, you've got to follow every clue, however slim. None of us is safe until you get your killer. I ought known better to pay any attention to a young squirt like you. Ah, listen, cap, I was only tryin' to help you. Captain beggs! What is it? Will you have a look at this, sir? Whose room is this? = Laurie's. Don't see no corpse. Trail leads along the floor. I'm tired of followin' them trails, you don't find nothin' at the other end except for a puddle of blood. Cap, look! Well there's one thing certain, he ain't guilty. You better tell ingston. All right. Wait, don't you go away. I'll need help with this corpse. Yes, sir. Mr. ingston, Laurie. How'd you get into that chair by yourself? Oh, I see. Still a little suspicious of me, aren't you? I'm sorry, everything's a little wacky to me, I guess. I just found Laurie in the next room. - Like the others? - Yeah. No chance of his still being alive, I suppose. No, no I'm afraid not. You going somewhere Dr. Harper? I really don't see that that's any of your business, miss judd. Answer me, do you think you're going somewhere? Yes. She's going to take a walk around the grounds with me. You're going to your room, and you're going to be locked in here. You're mistaken, miss judd. Dr. Harper's going back to the city. Get out, doctor, hurry! Get out! We can't leave without her. She won't leave her brother, she told me so. Get out, doctor, and lock the door! = you fool! If you loved your brother as I do, you'd have killed them yourself before you'd let them get away! This place has been the breeding spot of hatred, insane hatred, revenge, murder. It's got to be blotted out, and everyone in it. Let me go, let me go, you fool! Do you want us both to burn to death? Yes! There is nothing you can do about it! You and Kurt have no right to live, and I don't want to. Well, if you can believe the stories about this place, we're safe as long as those frogs keep croaking. There's a foot bridge down there, leads to a farmhouse. Come on. It's ingston, he's walking. = fine hero I turned out to be. = who fired the shot? Who cares, let's get you outta here. Hey, what's all the ruckus about? I just shot Mr. ingston. Ingston? Well how'd he get out here? He walked. Listen, have I got to go through all that again? I know that ingston can't walk. Neverthelees, he did. = but how? Oh, mechanical legs, never thought of that. Those aren't mechanical legs. = of course not. He materialized them, just as I materialized the skeleton in the library. = oh nonsense. Nobody in in their right senses will believe that hocus pocus. Are you quite sure? I see it, but I still don't believe it. For months, I've been training his mind. Giving him power by which he could restore himself in some degree to normality. Instead, he used the power to destroy the doctors whom he believed was the cause of his condition. Yes, but Millie and Laurie, they weren't doctors. No, but they found out too much, and so had Dr. Harper. Still doesn't add up. What about those pools of blood we found beside each body? The blood was ingston"s. There are certain details in the process that he did not yet master. It's all pretty horrible. Look the towers. = it was inevitable. A little knowledge of the occult is dangerous unless it's used for good. Disaster will follow its wake, that is cosmic law.
