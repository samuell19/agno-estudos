Did you hear anybody yelling for help? Seen anybody suspicious looking? - Snaky... - Yes Sir! What's the matter? - He needs a medical check-up. - Why? He told me he's dumb, I just want to confirm it. Yes sir, come over here! The victim was stabbed and strangled to death. I really don't get it. Why the murder used a silk stocking to kill her? Maybe the knife's not quick enough! We'll stay to investigate, over. When will you be back? I think it's gonna take some time. - No clue whatsoever? - Not yet! Shit, we'll be in trouble! - That's too bad! - Lousy Wong! I'm working now, don't use my nickname! Nothing. Sir, no clue was found. I think we're in deep trouble! Hey, she looks alright! Your girlfriend? - We used to go to the same school. - Doesn't make any difference! What are you working on? A homicide case! You've already got the murderer? No, he's my boss! Are you afraid of rats? You must be kidding! I just don't want to stamp on it. - Is he really a detective? - Sure! I've got to go to work now. Don't call me! Hey, she's a night-bird! Birds of the same feather flock together! Sissy! Hurry up, you only have 40 seconds! The murder took place just round the corner... Is that so?

Eh, you're a good driver. Why don't you do this for a living? If you like, I will. We'll be Bonnie and Clyde! We'll rob your Dad's Jewelry shop tomorrow. And your Mom's Boutique the day after. Terrific! What's that? What's happening? Where'd they go? Did you kick her out of the car? Special Announcement: At 2:00a.m. This morning. A girl was found dead in a car. She was strangled to death with a silk stocking. This case is similar to the murder of the Crazy Horse Showgirl last night. These murders could be committed by the same person. It's time for '3 hours with Sissy'... Another murder, very similar to the previous one. The murderer can be him, you or even myself. Who's the murderer? No one knows! But I'm sure you want to keep it to yourself. You won't tell anybody. Because you haven't got a friend to talk to. You should tell me. I'm a friend in need... Be brave and call me! I'll be able to understand you. And communicate with you, right? I'm brave. I'll call you. I'll tell you all about myself. Goddammit! Don't ever try to fool me! Sissy, don't hang up! My boss would like to invite you for a drink. - To hell with him, I'm too busy! - I beg your pardon? Tell him to go to hell! Stupid ass! I've told you not to call me! Hello, Sissy! It's me. I'm the wanted murderer... Like you, they didn't go to the movies with me. Watch out, it's your turn now! I'll be waiting for you tonight. I'll kill you the same way I killed them! Police Station Lousy Wong, no... Dear Wong, somebody wanna kill me! Good, serve you right! You talk too much! Please pick me up tonight! Sir! That tomboy wants you to pick her up tonight. Tell her to go to hell! - Bye-bye! - I'm off duty now. Sissy... Are you alright? Come here, Wong. Come here, Wong. Sir! Take it easy, you don't have to faint! Sir, I've nothing to do with this. It gets worse and worse! What does that mean? Look, she fainted again! Go away! Sissy... Don't be afraid, she's our colleague. How would I know! Sit here, you look perfect in front of the phoenix! The dragon's for you! What would you like to drink? Pu'li tea, Shou'mei tea please! - Remember to add chrysanthemum! - Okay. Don't be afraid, she's a policewoman. If you're not hungry, you can leave now. Don't you remember you've got a lot of work to do? Isn't that right? Yes... Why don't you go? I haven't eaten anything yet! Okay, you can have some tea. Miss Sissy... She hasn't had her breakfast yet! Let's order some Shark's Fin Soup for her. Great! Forget it! Sissy doesn't like Shark's Fin Soup! How about Mongolian Hotpot, it's the specialty here! You must be kidding. Today is too warm! Come on, order for yourself! Yes, anything you like. Okay, I'll have a Lobster Salad! Lobster? I think you'd better order. Some beef? - Some beef? - Sure! Okay, let's have 2 orders. Sissy... You like chicken feet? - You like that? - 2 orders! 2 orders! How about some tripe? - Okay? - Okay! When I first met you... - How about some spring rolls? - Why not... Spare ribs? - You like that? - Sure! How about some dumplings? Dumplings? - Sure! - Two please.

Do you care for some dessert? Like red bean soup, almond soup... Sure! Sir, I think it's gonna be very expensive! How about this? We'll order 2 bottles of XO and get drunk! Forget it, I know what to do. Waiter, check please! Sissy, will you give me a photo of yours? And your voice is different. Is that so? You like to hear it now? Yes. My dear friends, are you lonesome tonight? What are we going to? I know it's me who's got to pay! Thank you, it's $222 please! Okay, here's $300. Keep the change! Yes, keep the change! Thank you. You think I'm an oil sheik! Wait, take it to me. Please. Let me do it! - Why? - I'm going with you. Why don't you take a cab? I don't have any money! I've already paid, I won't do it now! Alright, but I don't have any coins. Sissy, I'll give you a lift, come on! Hurry up! Wait a minute! Goddammit! I don't think I can give you a lift now. Bye-bye! See, I'm so considerate. Give me some more! Just get lost! Bye-bye! - Be good! - Yes sir! Sir! Stop it! You don't wanna go home? No, I just want to buy a newspaper. No problem, I'll get you one. She's my girlfriend. Sir! Did you tell her this car is mine? No. Sorry Sir! - Be good! - Yes Sir! Goodbye Sir! - Sorry Sir! - It's really nothing! Hey, they are really something! These tomboys aren't good for any job but this! Honestly, if I ever get married, I'd rather marry you, not them! The fortune tellers says that, I'm no good for fat men! Actually, I never dress of becoming a policeman. But when I grew up, I found myself far too smart. So I become one, what else can I do? Hey Fattie, cruising chicks? "When you need the power" "The power to cruise chicks, take some Libogen!" I haven't raced for 3 years! Come on, let's have a race. Get on with it... Sorry sir! - Great. - Thanks. Stop. Sir! - Sir! - What's the matter? Sir, you speed was 97 m.p.h. Was it that fast? I was after some suspects! Yes Sir! But we only caught your car! Of course, I was much faster! I think you've got to give me your license. Thanks. - Be good! - Yes Sir! - Shave off your beard! - Yes Sir! You little thief... Is that what you learn in school, to steal! Scram. Go to school now! It's dangerous. You want to get run over! Don't play on the streets! Nutcase! - Are you alright! - I'm okay. Is this yours? Next time, don't cross without looking... Thank you, Uncle. Wear white socks! Don't wear white socks. Do you have something lighter? Sure! - I'd like to try them on. - Sure! Suzie, doesn't your husband fool around? He wouldn't dare! If he does, I'll get some of his ties out and cut them short. Then he'll behave himself for a while! Why? You really don't know? That means I could cut 'it' off anytime! Take care of the 2 bitches over there, will you? I really can't stand them! - Aren't they pretty? - Not bad. - What size? - 36! Do you feel lonely sometimes? Lonely? You must be kidding! I feel great when he's not around! You bitch! Hey, he's cute! Who'll try it on? Me first! I think you got the wrong foot! I'm sorry! Look at your dress! My dress? It's my legs! What do you think? Not bad. I think you better take this pair! Okay, I'll take this. Ma'am, we have a delivery service. Ma'am? I don't look that old! Watch it! Here's the address. No. 2, Shek O Road! Come on, he really got hooked! It's his own fault! Bye-bye! Bye-bye, honey! You do that to everybody? Why not? My husband's not around! I can't stand you. Get in. - Switch on the light. - Yes. The shoes are already here! What a mess! I'll drop these off. - You better hurry! - Okay. Where's the shoes? It's so strange. It's you! You bitch! To hell with you... I'm scared to death! Aren't you going to feed me? You get hungry fast, don't you? Don't bullshit, I'll take a shower first! Go ahead! You talk too much. Let me scare you to death. Damn it! You scared me to death! Don't worry, you still have a long way to go! You kidding me? Come on, I'm starved! Get me some food! I'll beat you up... Beat you to death... "Killing me softly with his song!" "Killing me softly with his song!" Suzie! This is the end of the Special Announcement. Sissy will be with you right away. Tonight is not a peaceful night... Another murder! I really don't understand why the murderer did it. Why are you so cruel to women? Were you deprived of mother love? Is there nobody who cares for you? Were you deserted by lover? - Get back earlier. - I know, honey. If you're married, I bet it's because your wife has made you a cuckold! Bye! Come on! Where's the bill? Mr. Eddie Wong, you've been found guilty of manslaughter, sentenced to 10 years imprisonment! I know it's bad enough to be a cuckold! If I'm right, judging from what you've done, you're a cold-blooded psychopath! Uncle! Uncle! I'm sorry, I help you pick it. For you! Bye-bye, uncle! It's incredible! The murderer is a woman! Terrible, isn't it? That's why I'm against marriage! You'll be finished off by your wife sooner or later! Wong! Give her a ring and scare her! Scare whom? I wanna kill you, kill you... Lousy Wong, what the hell are you doing? Nothing! Just wanna tell you we're not coming tonight. That's all! We are really not picking her up tonight! Not really, just want to scare her! Then she can't do without me in future! Bye! Anything handy I could use in case... I'll take this! - Remember to give it back! - I will. Stop it... It's me... Don't... You wanna kill him? It's his own fault! Did you get anything? She'll get arrested! Hateful, try to scare me. You still wanna fight? Come on! Eat something. It's good for you! Are you kidding? I can't even open my mouth! You want me to feed you? Yes! You can't open your mouth? Help yourself. Sissy! Do you know that the guy who calls you every night isn't the murder? An eyewitness pointed out that she's a woman. So you don't have to be scared by him! A woman? How can a woman be so cruel? Why not? Just look at my face! It's your own fault! I think these cases were done by the same person, and he must be a psychopath! Hey, you're also interested in this case? Why don't you come to my place tonight. We'll take a look at the evidence. Sure! How dare you invite her to your flat! I've left a file at your place. I've got to work on it tonight. Don't bother, you've got another assignment! To trap the sex-maniac in Tai Mo Shan. What about Butch Cassidy? Checking out dancing halls for minors. Coming! Welcome! - For you! - Thanks! Come on in, I planted these! You live alone? Yes, but I'm looking for a room-mate. It's tidy! I do the cleaning up myself. That's facing North-west. This is the South-east, it's quite breezy! It's cool in the summer! - Take a seat! - Thanks. Hey, some goodies inside! Take a seat! "There are 365 days in a year" "I love you everyday" Whisky or Brandy? Thanks, I'll have some coffee. Okay, I'll have coffee too! Come on, take a look. It's great! Your coffee! Thank you! This was taken when I was fourteen. What are we supposed to be doing work or chat? We can do both! In that case, I'm leaving! O. K... We'll chat away! - I'm leaving now! - Okay, we'll work! But I've got to leave at 11:00p.m. O.K. Come along. The witness' statement and some case files. The slides were taken at the scene. My specialty is pork chop, like some? Sure! I was taking a shower and heard some screaming. All of a sudden, Suzie came in, covered in blood. I was scared, and hid myself behind the curtain. Suzie was dragged out of the bathroom. I saw the murderer strangled her to death! What did the murderer use? Suzie's own silk stockings. Then the murderer came in to wash her hands. Thank God she didn't see me! Then I heard some pissing sound. Later she dried her hands with a towel. And she threw it at the tub. I didn't see the murderer's face, until just before she left. I saw her reflection in the mirror. It was a woman! She's got very long hair... I felt sorry for Suzie. What the hell? Turn the floor into this. What the hell are you doing? Sorry! Just in time, I'd like to see how you piss. Me pissing? Yes, come on... You want me to go through with it? That's fine! You like to see how I do it? Yes. Come on! Have you noticed any difference? I was standing up while you were sitting down. And? You were not shy, you were facing me. I was too shy, so my back was facing you. - Right? - That's right. - Hurry up, go in! - What for? Go in! So fast? I haven't taken my shower yet! Forget it, let's go in first! Look, the murderer pissed. But the footprint shows that he was facing inside. Get it? Like this! That's why I say the murderer is a man, not a woman! A man dressed up as a woman! Take a look at these photos. The victims were strangled with silk stockings. Besides, they all wore suspenders. This shows that the murderer can be easily aroused by people wearing suspenders and white stockings. If the murderer is really a man, I bet the nutcase has something to do with this. I agree. I should have thought of it! You've got to give me a hand. How? Lure the murderer out for me. Why should I? I can close the case if the murderer's arrested. I'll be promoted right away. My salary will be revised. With the money, I can marry you! Who says I'll marry you? Me! No way! I've known her for ages. But never knew she has such a fantastic figure! I knew it the first time I heard her voice! We've come. Ladies and gentlemen, the Police have discovered that the murderer of the three cases can be aroused if he sees people wearing suspenders and white fishnet stockings. The Police need your co-operation. Before the murderer is arrested. Do not wear suspenders or white fishnet stockings to prevent another murder. The Police need your co-operation. Come on, what are you doing? You want to be fired? White fishnet stockings and suspenders. The murderer won't be aroused. - Hello, TV? - Yes. Miss Sissy please! Who's calling? I'm a friend of hers. She's already left! Stealing all the time. Get out, I don't want to see you again! Uncle, Mummy says I'm always stealing. I really didn't. Do you believe me, uncle! I really don't steal... I never steal. Do you believe me? Please believe me, I didn't steal mummy's money. It's true! Get away! Go on! Scram! Get away! You're a shameless wicked man. You're not a woman. You're a psychopath! You're chicken. But I want to meet you. I want to see how tough you are. Call me if you have guts! This bit of music is for you: "Welcome to Hell"! Because that's where you belong, in hell! She's really giving it to him. I bet he'll call within 10 seconds. Hello, Radio 5? Damn it, you bitch, you were cursing me! She's engaged? You don't want to date me and yet you curse me on radio and TV. I can hear some funny music. - What music? - Cantonese Opera. Find out where it is. No.6 Kowloon City Road... Flat B, 6th Floor. Fine, go ahead! I'll be waiting for you. Bye! Sir, he's upstairs. How's everything? We haven't found him yet. Wong... Come in! What's the matter? You really do adore her! Sissy, we've got the murderer! You pick the date, we'll be married soon! You go to hell! You go to hell! Take him away! Why did you do this? I haven't done anything! Bye... Get on with it! You telling me the murderer's escaped and is coming to kill me? The police never got the murderer. And you're right, he's at the Station. Who's that? I'm the murderer you're looking for. Where are you? Right beside you, not there! No, not there! How come I can't see you? That's up to me. If I want to be seen by you. Let's talk! What about? You must want to know why I dress up and kill women in white stockings. Because that's what he did. Dress up like a woman, in white stockings! Do you understand that? I understand... Then why are you calling the police? Don't bother, I've cut all the lines. I've even dealt with the guard. And you, you're wearing white stockings too! And you know what I do to women who wear stockings? - I kill them! - Is that Sissy? She's always playing other voices. Isn't she good? Sounds really terrifying? But it's not like her voice at all. That's why she's good! You were strutting around on TV today! You wanted to meet me. Here I am! But I'm not dressed up, not in white stockings. And it's all because of you. And you still go around in those stockings. Well, you asked for it! - Fattie, help, help! - That's Sissy. Shall we get the others too? It'll be too late! - Step on it, back to the Station! - Yes Sir! Hurry up... Go and get him, hurry up! Yes Sir! Are you alright? He's over there! Let's go and take a look! Sir, a dead body! We've found the victim! Don't touch her! Sissy... Sissy... wake up. Why are you so late? I almost got killed! I'm here now! Don't worry, I'm here now! The ambulance's coming! Don't just stand there! Go and get the murderer! He's down in the basement. Go down! - Come along! - Yes sir! Don't worry! Hurry up! Come with me. He's one of us? Are you alright now? We've got the murderer, he's in the basement. You rest for a while, Take care of her! - The murderer is really something! - You bet! Help! He knocked one of us out. He's in uniform now. Help! God! Is he dead? - Find out if he's still upstairs. - Yes Sir! Hurry up! Go ahead! Hurry up... Watch out! Why there is power failure? So little space, how can I get out? Help me open the door. Don't move... What are you doing here? The murderer's upstairs, go and get him! Yes Sir! - Come down! - Yes Sir! Take off your clothes! Our clothes? If you see anyone in uniform, just get him! Yes Sir! Hurry up! Hurry up... Go ahead... Come on... We're here! Open up... Police! Open up! - It won't open. - The other way! Darling! I'm sorry! Please don't do that. You... You know I love you. Where... Honey, where are you? Sissy, I don't want to be a widower. Sir, I can't find the dead body. You want me to go down myself? We'll go down! Come on... Watch out... Sir, I couldn't find the body! Me too! - Keep on looking! - Yes Sir!
