Oh, some mistake. You were stealing a watch. - It's not a big deal. - What about your thieves code? Rule number one, never take anything besides cash. I forgot. Oh, no shit, you forgot. - Yeah I forgot. - What about that? How much do you owe? It's too much, okay? It's too much. By when? Too soon. Let's go now. Let's go now. Let's go to a bar? No, I think it's enough for you, and now, we're going to hit the streets. You know what? All right. Okay? Yeah. - Perfect. - Let's do it. Sound the alarms! Ring the Cavalry. You know, you're really fucking annoying, but you know, Mmhmm. I'm feeling inspired, and I really appreciate you. Thank you for waking me out of my stupor. - I know! - Hang on. Let me just- - Just to serve you. - I've gotta grab my shoes, okay? Okay. Open up! Jesse? Do you know what time it is? I'm sorry, sir. If he's not answering the door, that means he ain't needed your services tonight! Excuse me? I'm not a hooker. Well, you could have fooled me. Now, you get on outta here, or I'm gonna call the cops on ya. And don't you touch that door! Okay. - Jesse? - You are so done. Open up. Jesse, open up! My emergency? - 9-1-1. - Yes. I've got a- Asshole! Are you safe, sir? She's harassing my neighbor, and she's been calling me names, and I want somebody out here. I want her arrested. I'm listening to you. Are you okay, sir? I need somebody here immediately, A-S-A-P! You want another? Actually, I should go. It's on the house. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Hey, hey, are you okay? What's going on? Who? Do you know them? Okay, wait there. I will be soon. Shit! Sara? Where are you, my love? I'm in the house. I'm hiding in our closet. Oh, my god! I left the door unlocked. I think they're coming in. Okay, it doesn't matter, my love. Just, you know, be quiet and hide, so they cannot hear you. Oh, my god! They're heading this way. No, no, be quiet. I'm on my way. Yeah, yeah, I'm- No! I'm on my way! Gab? Gab, it's just me. Gab? Gabriela? Hey, sexies. Looks like I'm too busy to pick up. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back. Thanks. No, no, no, no. Oh, my god! Oh, my love. Oh! Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for leaving you. No, I'm sorry. Oh, you don't have to apologize. Let's take you to the hospital, okay? No. - No? - No. What? They said if I... They said if I go to- Oh, it's okay. Let's take you inside. Let's go. Oh, be careful, careful, careful, careful, careful. Take it slow, okay? Oh, my god. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw them coming towards the complex. Uh-huh. So then I ran and hid in the closet. And then they knocked on the door, and they opened it. Oh, I'm such an idiot. I should have locked the door. No, no, no, it wouldn't matter. If they wanted to come for you, a locked door couldn't stop them. What happened next? They searched the place, and then they found me in the closet because the phone rang. Then they took me out back and beat me up. Shit! But I don't understand. We paid them! We paid them! We don't owe them anything. Why? Interest. They want interest, Sara, because it took too long to pay them. Oh, my god. I'm sorry I dragged this into our marriage. No wonder you prefer Jesse over me. No, no, don't say that, okay? I don't prefer him. He's my partner in crime, and you are my partner in life. Okay. When do we need to pay this? Today? No, 48 hours. How much? $60,000. They said, if we don't pay- - No, no, no, no. Look, we are going to make it work, okay? Okay. Nothing's going to happen to you, so trust me. Sara, it's too much money. How are we gonna raise it in two days? I'm going to make it work. I'm going to think something. Now, you should rest. Yeah. There you go. Oh. Going to take care of this. Shit! Okay. Oh, where are you going? Hey, I'll be back soon. Don't leave. I don't wanna be alone right now. Hey, I'll be back tonight. Have some rest. I'm scared to be alone. Don't. Jess? Jesse? I'm up. Jesus! Sara! - Good morning. - Sara. There's... There's nicer ways to wake a sleeping man. Hey, hey, stop! - Sara. - You stop! Oh, it's gettin' hot! Stop! Okay. I need you nice and sober. I'm fuckin' nice. Listen to me. I have a plan. Who's Francis? So this is a guy that you and me, we are going to rob today. Mmmm. - What makes you think- - Hey, I need you nice and sober tonight, okay? What makes you think I'm gonna help you rob this guy? So the people that I most care in the world are in problems, and they owe to the same assholes. Wait, baby, calm down. Wait, Gab? I thought... I thought you guys were square? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I thought that too, but it turns out, we owe 60 Gs to those assholes. That's worse than me. I know, I know. Well, I don't wanna know. I wanna know, no actually I wanna know. - Oh! - Thousand. Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah, that's... That's so much better, yeah. So we owe like... Like $100,000 by tomorrow, and the streets are not going to pay for that. We need only one big hit. Look - Only one. - The streets is our shtick. That's all we do, all right? That's what we're comfortable with for a reason. Well, I have another plan. This guy has in under his desk over $1 million in diamonds. Diamonds, see. You almost had me. Now I'm out. I'm not giving you an option. We are going to do this together. We don't need to steal them all. Just a couple. Enough to make the hundred, and a little bit just in case. If I say yes, do I get a beer? No. - I'm out. - So- You need to listen. There's no security cams. There's no guards. It's going to be simple. Just one time, and that's it, we are out. I told you what happened with Big Bob, man. Cash is the safest, all right? Oh, just - Bob fucked with jewels. - Stop it with Big Bob! Bob fucked with credit cards. Bob's in fuckin' prison in Arizona. Yeah, he's fucking - You wanna go to Arizona? - Yeah- No, no, no, he's in fucking prison, but we are not Big Bob. I should have been an airline pilot. Dude, he's coming. Look, I should have chosen any other profession that didn't put me in this fucking car next to you for three hours for no fuckin' reason. Oh, tell me! You're not very pleasant. That's a word, right? Pleasant. You wanna see me be pleasant? No, no. How about this guy with some fuckin' witchcraft then I'll be pleasing as fuck, if you're gonna please anyone. Oh! I think... Okay, is that- Okay! That him? Well, you're blocking my... Fuck! Sh, sh, sh, sh. Here we go. You ready? Yeah. Mister... No. One. Uhhuh. - Seven. - Uh-huh. - Seven. - Uh-huh. - Nine. - Uh-huh. - Nine, three. - Uh-huh.
