THE DREAM OF THE BUTTERFLY But what can I do, helpless as I am? Oh, mother, you would not speak thus if you felt the shiver of death. You are beside yourself. What has occurred? While I… was running to come here, I saw in the torchlight… they dug the grave that on the morrow shall receive my cadaver. Imagine… these eyes that gaze upon you, they would eclipse with night. This heart that beats, they want to stop with bullets. The windows in the market that shall close upon the spectacle are all reserved. And the same man, standing on life's pinnacle, beholding the future like a fairy tale, will begin tomorrow to decompose in a narrow box and on his tomb a stone recounts: He was. My son, if this is heaven's will, you must arm yourself with resolution and dignity. Oh, mother, the world is so beautiful! Let me not, I beseech you, descend so soon into that dark kingdom of shadows. Punish me if I dared to disobey, but why must there be gunfire? Depose me from my offices, even degrade me. If the law demands, dismiss me from the army. By God, the Almighty Father, since I beheld my grave, I desire nothing but life. And I do not ask that it be kept with honor! Arise my son, arise. What are you saying? You are deeply moved. Control yourself. I renounce happiness forever. And tell him, forget it not, that I desire Natalie no more. She's free again. As if I never existed. Good. But now go back to your prison. That is the first demand I make if you want my favor. You cry, unfortunate girl. The sun today lights all your hopes to the grave. Your heart decided from the first on me. I look into your eyes… and I know your heart is as true as gold. It will never belong to another. Return, young hero, to your prison walls. And in your passage, imperturbably regard once more the grave they dug for you. It is neither darker or wider than those that battle showed a thousand times before. Meanwhile, since I am true to you till death, I'll chance to my uncle, a word that can save you. It may avail, perhaps, to move his heart and free you from your pain. I had liked to propose to you… something new regarding the character of Ulysses. One who is always considered the great hero of knowledge. Indeed, it could only be… the expression of great distress of Greek man… faced with the irrational. He takes refuge from the monsters… of what is now… called the unconscious. He wants to return to… the reassuring home and the equally… reassuring wife. It will take millennia before man… finds the courage… to face what inside of him… is not reason. But I don't want to bore you any longer. That's enough for today. Thank you. You're very kind. Professor, excuse me, I'd like to know if I can do a thesis on your theory. I find it very fascinating. - Of course. Goodbye. Excuse me, Professor, do you think I'll pass the exam for this course? I can't say. Thank you. Professor? Excuse me. I'd like to speak to you. My name is Giuliani. I'm a director… and I need your help. Yes? I saw your son in The Prince of Homburg, and I was struck by his interpretation. Very much so. He's very good. - Ah, yes, I know. He always was. He never seems to need to learn anything. But let's go where we can talk better. - No, never mind. It won't take long. Now then…something happened which I can't explain. This is it: I went to find his dressing room. I don't know why, maybe he didn't like me, but for some mysterious reason which I couldn't understand, the fact is that he wouldn't answer me. He never responds. I don't know how to explain it, it's not easy. He was 14 years old and… he decided not to accept normal speech anymore. I don't know, maybe he was hurt by some girl. I don't know. He chose an acting career. So he can speak without speaking. Extraordinary. Wait, wait one moment! I wanted to work with him. Now this changes things. His story must be put on stage. You write the text, please. Me? But… To write a play, you need a poet. I'm only a student of poetry. Excuse me, Professor. I let myself get carried away by excitement. I'm sorry. Come, can I get you a drink? Why are you here? Don't tell me you want to know about Massimo? Did you write anything? It's impossible to write his story. But you're a poet. For that very reason. And then they use words, you know. But he has given up talking. Please, don't keep standing there. Sit down and put on your glasses like when you study. I'd like that better. It's you who made him like that. He was born that way. Forgive me for bothering you again. Maybe, I'm being a bit pushy. But I wanted to ask you… I know. You want the text and can't wait, right? Please. Tell me how long I must wait. What comes to mind… is always the very same sentences. I spoke little with you. That's why you rebelled. I wrote beautiful things. I never said them to you. I thought you understood me. And it is I who must understand you. I have this for you. Take it. And be excellent as usual. I know you don't want to answer me. Here, I'm leaving it. You are my most beautiful son. You didn't want to be yourself. Maybe you were afraid and with good reason. You only try to give happiness to others. You're like a clown. You are my most beautiful son, my love. "I never said anything but I killed my mother to be with you." "I never said anything but I left my father to be with you." "I never said anything but I separated from my brother to be with you." "I could love you after being left alone." "I could love you after being left alone." "I could love you only after giving up my loved ones." "I could only love you when silence was the master of my life." The sea in winter is cold. There's nobody here. Don't you ever get bored? There's studying. A good reason to live. You say you have a reason? I don't know what it is. I'd be very curious to discover what is so precious that my silent little brother is hiding? What do you care? You are a physicist. Even Massimo is a physical reality. You'll see that I find it out first. More than a 1000 years, you've wandered the world. You can't love any place. But you have always built so many things. And you're afraid of the world. You shut yourself in houses like a walnut inside a shell. For all of you time doesn't exist. Are you at a good point with your research? And you? Where are you with yours? I am old. I stopped at the problem with women. I don't know what they have to do with knowledge. Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa, Penelope, Helen, Jocasta. Now that I think of it, Oedipus has no women. Except for his mother. And how's it going with Anna? It's going rather well. I don't know what she's looking for. It's like she's missing something. It's like she's always searching for something that she lost and she never finds it. She's looking for the Golden Age. Eternal youth, the hope of adolescence. Many times, I fear that she's not intelligent enough to actually manage doing things. Massimo will have another play. I brought it to him. You don't love him. He's always so strange. He's not strange. He's beautiful. He does beautiful things. He chose something that… one can't understand what it is. Certainly he succeeds in being original. But I wonder… how sad he could be. I like him. He always reminds me of something… from my adolescence when… when my voice broke. No, you don't love him. He wants to be an artist. There's no telling what artists are. Stay with us, Mom. The two of us are calmer, more at ease, more reassuring. My beautiful daughter, how are you? Are you happy with your freedom? You've imitated the birds of the sky, the cicadas of the trees? Do you enjoy life or do you just think? About freedom? Yes, Mama. But I don't care about anything. Is it love? You wanted to be intelligent, so you left us. You used to say the old house was a prison. Love, intelligence, happiness: the most beautiful fairy tales of the past. How many did you tell me? Sometimes I think I believed them. The fairy tales are true. But you must be very, very intelligent to understand them. Your husband treats you well? More than well. Mama… I wish you could give me back what I lost by leaving this house. I wish that you could open my eyes to something which I can no longer see. I wish I could find the love I had when you raised me. I didn't want to hate you but my past has come back, I'm not free. Come, let's have dinner. Why did you come? Where did you come from? For a 1000 years… I followed you. Do you believe in fairy tales? Can you give me hospitality just for tonight. I don't want to be with you. You're just an illusion. You see, a man courts you. Offers you some happiness but you don't want it. You used to believe in fairy tales. If you want, you're Cinderella and the Prince. Snow White and the Prince. Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. You can be whatever you want. You must be intelligent to understand fairy tales. It seems to me that there's no beauty. - Beauty will come later. In all its various applications. We'll obtain extraordinary results. We'll defeat the forces of nature. You distort nature! You become more unrecognizable. You manufacture anguish. One day, he who has a physical function will be useless. And I feel like pissing on your evil devices! Do it if you can. It won't be you who'll stop these machines. What's happening to you? You're beginning to pay for you choice of purity. Compromises are useful for survival. You don't want to touch something you have… for fear of getting dirty. Go on like the Trappist who never says a word all his life. You despise human language… because it's too poor to express… What? The sweetness of feelings? The beauty of images? You third-rate ham. You don't appreciate the reverence your father has for the ancient tongues. You don't appreciate his wisdom. You're suffering from some vulgar Oedipus complex. "How shameless is your arrogance. Who do you think you've offended?" "Me, a poor old man or yourself?" "Tell me." "Your mouth vomited forth on me homicides," "marriages, tragedies of every kind." "Tragedies that struck me against my will." "But thus the gods had decided who from a long time ago," "were angry against my people." "As for me," "you could never trace any fault so infamous" "that may have caused all this pain to you and my family." "So then," "answer therefore." "If a divine voice via an oracle announced to my father" "that he would be killed by his own son's hand," "in the name of what justice you now want to accuse me?" "Me who wasn't yet born?" Oedipus at Colonus. The redemption from fault, the not knowing. Who knows if it's right? Go call your cynical brother. Ah, right: you can't call anybody. The Little Mermaid who lost her voice to have legs. You'll die in solitude because you're not able to ask for help. It will be me… to end up inside the tunnel. It will be me who is defeated by a super technical son. Come here, my little mute. You need me every now and then, right? You need me to talk to you and say what you don't want to say. You'll die one of these days. Come. Come! Come and dream a little out of this world. What fairy tale shall I tell you? The one that you always like so much? I'll tell you the one how men learned how to lie. Are you happy? Your sister-in-law came. She always suffers because she seeks happiness. Maybe pleasure. No… No, she's not convinced that pleasure is happiness. You're satisfied with being yourself. You roll in the mud of the past, always trying to be what you are not. And you always live your present as if you were sleeping on a bed of roses. As if it would never end. And you're forced to do things. Speak! It would spare you from having to do things. Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you sleepy? Do what you want. You want me to guess like the mother does with the baby? No, that's not the place for you. Sit at the head of the table. We are old. We know how the world is. Tomorrow will be like today. Don't you care about the future? Because since men started talking the end of the world began. The end of the world began. The end of the world began. You are beautiful when you move, like an animal. You move like an animal. You move like an animal. Did you stop time not to die? You have no future. "All hail, Macbeth!" "Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!" "All hail, Macbeth!" "Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!" "All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!" "Lesser than Macbeth…" "and greater." "Not so happy, yet much happier." "Thou shalt get kings," "though thou be none." "Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd." "Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined." "Harpier cries," "'Tis time," "'tis time." "You lack the season of all natures, sleep." How are you? What have you been doing lately? Are you well? Sophocles? Shakespeare? What did you do? The wisdom of the world, eh? I'd be curious to know what you are looking for. Will you become like me or do you want to discover the secret of staying young? What a strange choice you made. But I trust you. You are good. Take that rose and go away, or else I will become bad. Like every time you reproach me for my life of little courage. Wait. You are like them: with your natural growth like the plants. And you managed to be yourself. Don't give in, don't die. All I have left is love for you. Always show me what I have failed to be. I'm tired. Give me those scissors. Go now. You must believe in yourself. Take me home! Take me where you want! Massimo! Don't take me home. Take me to you. In that place that is unknown to me. Take me to you where all is silence. You and your hideous pride! You don't know that goodness and purity kill others! May you be cursed! "I only asked you to love me…" "because my image was beautiful to you." "I didn't ask you to become ugly to make me beautiful." "I only asked you for joy…" "because my love was juice for you." "I didn't ask you to become poor so I can taste joy." Stop right there. Now this scene should express a search for love. You must move between… Between the real and the unreal. Between waking and dreaming. And you try not to turn this into some banal confession to the police. You must make people understand fully the difference between killing your mother, leaving your father and separating from your brother. Let's go. "I never said anything but I killed my mother to be with you." "I never said anything but I left my father to be with you." "I never said anything but I separated from my brother to be with you." No! Another thing: Massimo, in your line, you must make felt… your solitude. Let's move on. Or better: the contrast between love and solitude. "I could love you after being left alone." "I cannot love you, if you renounce life." "I could love you only after giving up my loved ones." "I cannot love you, if you renounce love." "I could only love you when silence was the master of my life." "I'll express myself to you with my body." "I shall tell you a beautiful fairy tale of eternal love." "I'll wrap you in the perpetual desire of continuous dissatisfaction." Careful! This is not a declaration of love. You put too emotion into it. Start over. "I'll express myself to you with my body." "I shall tell you a beautiful fairy tale of eternal love." "I'll wrap you in the perpetual desire of continuous dissatisfaction." No, it's not good. You don't get it. Let's start from the beginning. "I never said anything." "I never said anything." "I never said anything." What do you want? What do you want? Food? Where do you come from? You don't talk? Are you mute? Did you have a fight? Oh, yes. After all, talking isn't really important. I lived for many years in silence. If you don't speak, it's just like normal for me. You're nicer when you don't talk. I… when I was young, wanted to say so many things to somebody. But I was never able to. Stay with me. Remain silent. I can do the talking. I love you. Now you're even more beautiful… with the light of the fire before you. Stay with me. I'll give you wine too. You like silence. But now it's starting to scare me. You love him. But you can't leave him like that as if he were never born. You must ruin him a little to make him more human. Meanwhile, he will grow old and become ugly. Careful, you can't always love an ideal. We have nothing to give you. We live our lives as the days come. We are beautiful. And we can't do anything for you. That boy decided not to talk to anyone. But he's not disabled. He has a beautiful voice. He decided to disguise himself as a mute to look like you. This way, his beauty will not be disfigured. This way, his thinking will not become corrupt. This way, his images will not be made ugly. He loves himself like an ideal. He loves me like an ideal. He loves to act. He doesn't hurt anyone. But he has nothing to give you. Massimo, do you want to dance? "You are my most beautiful son." My most beautiful son. "I never told you anything." I never said anything. "I only asked you to love me." Only to love me. "Because my image…" My image. "…was beautiful to you." Beautiful to you. "I didn't ask you to become ugly to make me beautiful." To make me beautiful. "I cannot love you." I cannot love you. "If you renounce life." - Renounce life. "If you renounce life." Renounce life. "I cannot love you!" I cannot love you. - "If you renounce love." Renounce love. "We have nothing to give you." Nothing to give you. "We live our lives…" "as the days come." Our life. As the days come. "But he is not disabled. He has a beautiful voice." A beautiful voice. "He has a beautiful voice." A beautiful voice. You are my most beautiful son. You didn't want to be yourself. Maybe you were afraid… and with good reason. You only try to give happiness to others. You're like a clown. You are my most beautiful son. My love. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
