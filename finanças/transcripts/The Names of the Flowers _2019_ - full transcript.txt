Once upon a time there was a school teacher who one day made a soup for a great man like Che Guevara Who was a prisoner in her classroom. In return for her favour, he recited the poem The Names Of The Flowers Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed by the name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this daily our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses,As we forgive those who trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation And deliver us from evil Amen The Names Of The Flowers For many years the teacher went to the school everyday to share her story about the soup and the flower but when the 50th anniversary of death of the great man arrived, everything began to change for her We put aside the International Monetary Fund And now we are doing better... Without International Monetary Fund Because we haven't allowed their blackmail Our programs and policies Aren't being imported from outside nor from the top They originate at the bottom and go up, brothers and sisters This is the profound difference Where is the house of the teacher who gave the soup to Che Guevara ? -In what year was Che Guevara killed in our school ? - 1967 -On the day of anniversary we... ...put our best manners -Last one -How many days are left before the anniversary ? - Five days She won't take any order from us Tomorrow I will come back with Sanjines As the preparation for the anniversary progressed, and each scene was carefully rehearsed the organizers mistrusted the stories they heard from the villagers Many of the villagers were forbidden from returning to the school and many others were sent to prison for falsification and illegal tourism Among them; the only son of the teacher It's not a typical prison as you know. There are women, children There's a hospital there are doctors, nurses and they are all informed of your son's illness because they have his medical history. Also, I was informed that he wants to give a clarinet concert to all the prisoners which means he must be feeling better. Don't you think ? On the other hand because of the recent frauds and falsifications at the time of this important anniversary We are investigating to see what is true and what is false. Therefore today I'm here to ask you not to return to the school until we verify your story of the soup and the flower. Once verified, you can return. Do you agree ? Long live my homeland Bolivia A great nation For her I would give my life And also my heart With her son in prison for sometime already And due to the tension in the village The teacher felt more helpless than ever In the end she had no option but to let hucksters in her house The clarinet you have is nice Your son plays it nice The price is a bit high If you lower it let me know Hi, nice to meet you How old are you ? Sixteen At sixteen a man knows what he wants Do you think I can shake his hand again ? Everything depends on tomorrow Disobeying the colonel's orders The teacher decided to return to the school the next day Not knowing that her life would forever change The Names Of The Flowers -Don't worry colonel I'm sure this woman is not the real teacher who... Met Che Guevara in the classroom The woman we brought is not the one who gave the soup to Che Guevara I found out that there are many other women telling the same story They all say the same thing, they use the same words, That they gave a soup to Che , that... That after eating the soup he started to recite a poem about flowers, The same, the same -And was this woman a teacher of the school at the time of Che ? - Yes, she was, but she is not the teacher who gave the soup to Che Guevara. We are looking for her. The rout of Che Guevara has been established here to bolster the tourism industry in our country and in our region. To help the people to create more jobs for the locals. We are not here to take away jobs from locals nor to exclude them from tourism However it's important to note that while the government invites all your parents and families to participate in a clean and healthy Che Guevara tourism, there is zero tolerance for any illegal tourism activity. Tell me how it goes The rumors about other women with the same story of the soup and the flower had been heard for some time Hoping to find the truth before the day of anniversary the authorities expanded their search to a nearby lake. Where is the house of the teacher... - Hi - Hi - How much is your water ? - 50 Bolivians -It's sacred water - It's expensive, isn't it ? - Yes - Why is it sacred ? - It's... it makes... ...miracles, this sacred water, for people... miracles... it also cures those who are sick... -What miracles does it do ? - It gives happiness... the sacred water... It also heals. - Right - That's what... it does... and for women to marry good people -Where is your grandmother ? -My grandmother... at my house.... by the river, that's where she is There by the river.... that's where my house is. Over there That's my home -Do you know how to read ? -Yes -Let's see -I've read, I know how. I've read at my house. At my house.... Where is the house of the teacher who gave the soup to Che .. Gue....Gueva... Guevara and then he recited the poe...poem about... about the... flowers to her ? - You know what ? I'm going to give you two hundreds Bolivians but I need you to give me the teacher's address. - Ok. - I want you to ask your grandmother for the address. I'll come back on Thursday. I'll come get the address. Find it out for me, ok ? - Ok, I can come back. - Write it down on the paper I gave you. - Ok, I can come back. - Alright - I'll come back Thursday - Yes, I'll come back. - Bye. - Bye. - You have to understand me... I can't let my son go with you anymore they already arrested my other son a month ago... what am I going to do if I loose this one too ? - They have arrested everyone They already took your sick son, right ? They told you many times not to go there. They don't want us to talk to visitors. You are going to cause problems for yourself. In my situation, I can't take that risk anymore. Today is the last time I'll allow him to come with you. Fearing the consequences, the teacher's friends abandoned her even the one who used to bring her visitors for many years. Ever since the opera was born , it has always been considered Sui generis. There are some very interesting letters from Monteverdi to his brother before Monteverdi composed L’Orfeo and he's seeing the first operas that debut in Florence and that he sees in Mantua. He says to his brother that there is a very strange thing now that's like a play but all the characters sing and they sing all the time... -Stop, stop ! -My brother is suffering in prison! - It's the truth, we want justice - Ma'am please - They took everyone, please ! - Ma'am please wait ! - I want freedom for my brother ! Please! Free them ! - Please ! They will die in there ! - He's sick ! - Please , listen to us ! - Free my brother ! - Freedom for our brothers ! - Please !, Please ! - Listen to us ! - Let them go ! - Do something ! Please ! Please ! - Let them go ! - Please ! - Wait ! - Freedom for my brother ! - He's sick ! - Please open the window ! - Please listen to us ! - Please ! - Ma'am leave them alone ! - Free our sons please ! - Justice -Hi -Hi -Are you still selling bottles of water ? - Yes -You have more now, how many did you fill ? - I have... - Ok -Did you find the address ? - I don't have the address -I don't have it -What do you mean you don't have it ? -Give me the address, I need it ! -I don't have it -Look...! -Without that address you'r going to be in trouble. -So, I need that damn address -Yes -Tell me the address -I don't have it -Give me the address you little shit -I don't have it -I gave you money, where is my money ? -I don't have it -I don't have it -Shit -Shit -I don't have it -Fuck As the clock was ticking towards the anniversary finding the real woman with the story of the soup and the flower had become a challenge for the organizers. A few days later they found new clues that could lead them quickly to the truth For god's sake, look at our country. One sells water from the lake saying it's blessed by Che that it works miracle, that it heals people. The other one selling her fake story of the soup and flower to tourists for fifty years. Long live, my homeland Bolivia For her I would give my life and also my heart When I left my house to go to work, I was surprised to see smoke in the air helicopters flying I could hear explosions. I got to the school and it was surrounded by police. I asked one of them what had happened. He told me they had captured Che and they had him in my classroom. I asked the officer to let me speak with him, and he told me that it wasn't allowed. That I couldn't go in. But I pleaded and insisted and he let me in. We spoke for a while and he told me he was very hungry. I told him that... I would go home and make him a soup. I went home and made the soup and came back with it in a clay bowl. I gave him the bowl... He grabbed it and he drank the soup with both hands, because he was handcuffed. He finished the soup and he gave me back the bowl. As I was going back home, I heard gunshots. I went back... and I found Che already dead with his eyes open. -So, Che Guevara didn't recite you a poem about a flower or anything like that ? You only brought him the soup ? -No, he didn't recite any poetry, and there wasn't a flower in the classroom. That's false, it's a lie. He didn't recite any poem. He just drank the soup and that was it. Days passed And no one heard from the teacher Until one afternoon she was seen heading back towards the school Bring her here I'm very sad about your son’s current situation, that he can't play his instrument due to his health is a shame. I'm sorry. I have a son and a daughter at home. However I came today to talk to you .... to tell you that you shouldn't go back to that school anymore, because it's a lie. It's a lie that you met Che Guevara, that you made him a bowl of soup, and that he recited a poem about a flower. We are being very considerate with you. Because of your age and your health... because of your son's condition... and we're not going to take any legal action, but I want to make this very clear... if you go back to the school ever again, I'll be forced to send you next to your son. We need to respect history History is like this house you live in and we're destroying it with falsehoods.. with fake stories. Would you destroy your own home ? Would you take a hammer and destroy the walls of this house with your own hand ? No...I don't believe so After colonel left the teacher remained in the kitchen for three days. Only at dawn on the forth day did she leave her place. For my mother The Names Of The Flowers
