This movie is based on actual events. - I'll bet you a grand that the Mark will get devalued this year. - No way. We'll see. Shake on it. Good evening. The Finnish Mark has been devalued. The Finnish Bank and the government were forced to act - - as currency leaks abroad continued. Over ten thousand unemployed workers convened to demonstrate - - at the house of parliament. Viinanen, Viinanen goddamn him! The people cried out for jobs. I am a construction engineer, out of work for two years. The government will not resign. We have to save money now. The poor will suffer. This month, interest rates reached almost 30 per cent. Welcome to the official top 40. Good evening, and welcome. We have been asked where rap was born. I'm betting it was Lieksa. I am always striving for more, nothing is enough. BORN IN HEINOLA What a fucking bore. Temonen, leave him. Let's go. Oh crap... Yo Elli. Know what? You look exactly like my next girlfriend. - Did you think that would work? - Worth a shot. He was looking at you, not me Besides, she noticed me, right? - Well yeah.. - Heh! - How can they dance to this shit? - Pretty fun to look at, though. Kill him! I'm going to... take a leak. No way! Obbe! Tukutukutuk! Obbe! Tukutuku! Dude, you know Obituary! For sure! That double bass drum, man, so freaking hard! - Hi, I'm Antti Lautala. - Toni Wirtanen - Let go of me! The fuck you looking at? Goddamn it. Come on Tuukka, Tuukka... - That dude is fucked up. - I know, right. Have you got a band yet? Good, we'll start one. What do you play? You've got an instrument? - I used to play the guitar. - Great. Still have it? - Yea, at home, but... - Great. I haven't played for ages. Dig it out and we'll hang some time. I don't know. Not interested? Fine, I won't force you. Government policies have further weakened the economy. Unemployment is on the rise and businesses are failing. Will you feel it at the factory? It's not looking great... - What happened to you? - Fucking... you won't shut up. - Let's see how rusty I am. - Hey, Toni- - playing the guitar is like riding a bike, you know? Once you learn it, it's in your... Like in your muscle memory. You know? - Really? - Really. - Antti! - Hi Reetta, nice to see you. I'm Reetta and you have to be extra nice to me because I have a pacemaker in my heart. - Okay... - Yeah, or I could die. And when you die, you'll become a zombie. You'll rise from your grave. And when you do - you only want to drink blood and eat guts. - Did I hear Antti there? - Hi. Simo is in his room. - Hey, Antti - Hi-hi-hi Toni - Sipe, Sipe -Toni - Toni - Hi - You found that W.A.S.P. poster? - Yeah - So freaking cool. - Oh Jesus... Hearing Blackie felt like getting a shovel to the head. When I first heard Be somebody I wrote in my journal: "I will become a founding member of a rock band." Well, you're getting there. The founding member of a two-man group, I mean. - You'll never guess what happened. - You turned into a zombie? - We just decided I'll be a drummer. - Sipe will be a great drummer. All right then. Here's the thing: I need some money to buy a drum set. I don't think you understand what's going on in the economy right now. Lots of people were just let go from the factory. And what's drumming for a hobby anyway? Better than chasing a stupid ball around a lawn. That's it for the drums. For once there's something cool and money ruins it. It's so fucked up. You'll get your drums. - Yeah, like in a year. - It's better than never. Wait a minute. There you go. - Thank you, Mrs. Santapukki! - Bye. I won't let anyone boss me around, you know? Not my dad, or teachers or anybody. The system is bad enough and I don't want to be a part of that shit. This is one of those moments, Sipe, where you can make a choice. Stick up for You, you know? But you need the fucking drums. - Yep I'll be 35 before I have enough money saved up. I think we do have an option. - Shut up, Wirtanen - What did I say... I'm not entirely sure about this. Stealing from innocent kids is not right on any level. - Exactly! - Nobody is innocent in this world. And secondly, the orphanage is insured, so that - the kids will get better drums anyway, if we borrow these ones. Ok, let's do it. Toni, you'll stand guard. Do something if anybody shows up. What the fuck! What am I going to do if... - Are you nuts? - Grab it, damnit! Turn it. Take it, take it! - How the hell are we going to... - On bikes, of course. Alright, cool. This sure doesn't look suspicious at all. - Can't we get another bass drum? - We are not going back for that. What the fuck! We've got drums! - What the fuck! We can get half the usual order of steel. Half? There's no point in getting any more - before the old stock is sold. Don't you have any decent clothes? Like a sports coat, a suit? You still don't have to walk around like that. What do you care? You see me maybe twice a week. Deal with it. What did you want? I need a couple hundred. Come work for me and I'll pay you. Not fucking interested. Let me have a smoke. - Ain't you got your own? - Fuck, no. Totally out of cash. You saw nothing. Hello. 10.40, please. Exact change. I can't buy these. You're wearing a tie, just go, they won't ask... - Hello. - Got your ID? Yea, got it here somewhere. I think I left it in the car. What about you? Maybe you didn't hear: we drove here. Well run off to the car and get your ID then. Give me a Barclays or do I look younger than 16? Is this yours? Yeah, yes it is. My name is Mandy. Who are you? I'm Sipe. Nice to meet you, Sipe. These are really awesome bands. I mean... "Todella hyviä bändejä". Yea. - See you! See you. Screw you for not having anything for a good, decent citizen who needs a job! I should trash your whole offices! Just trash it! - Word. Imekää munaa! That Mandy is so cool. - Sipe, are you sure - you didn't just make this girl up while jerking off? It's just that this city is not exactly where you'd - find that kind of a punk goddess. Yeah, I'm sure. You'll see. I think regular girls are the coolest. Cooler than punk chicks? You just don't get that hidden tenderness. Like "off the record"... I was thinking of asking Elli out. - Oh! - Getting a taste of that - hidden tenderness. Hat-hat. You would have missed a lot if you never came to HEINOLA. I dunno. Wasn't my call. Why did you move? Mom wanted to move away from Salo when dad died. You dad's dead? - Yea. - Toni. The band still doesn't have a name. That's a... regrettable fact. I want our name to be - - a statement, like my songs. How about Apulanta (Fertilizer)? Apulanta?!? How is that a statement? - Well, it's weird, and you can make a fucking bomb out of it. You can make a fucking bomb out of it! - There's something to it... - It's bloody brilliant! - That "N" is all fucked up. - Looks awesome as fuck, though. The fuck you standing there for? Fucking geek. Elli! Elli, wait up. - Hi. - Hi. What's the plan? For like, your day? - What's it to you? - I was just thinking maybe... we could do something? Like, together. If that's ok with you. Well it's not. Okay. Just forget it. Yea. - I mean like - it's not ok tonight. But tomorrow's good. Mm, we made plans with the guys to go play music. - Then you're probably gonna do that. - No, I won't! Or... maybe that too. Good. See you at six. See you. Come on, come on! Rock that goal! Hi! Two fries with sausage, and milk. Thanks. Are you serious? Yep-yep. My treat. You took me out to a hockey game? Best fries in town, you know. Right... I didn't know you're into hockey. I'm not, like really, just now and then. Simo isn't into any sports. Not hockey, not soccer. They're not for everybody, and that's ok. Risto Santapukki, isn't it? The one and only. Remember me? Well? Aren't they? - What? The best fries in town! Well yea, they're ok. Sorry I'm late, I know. - Dude's really learning. I just fucking said that! We're getting tight! Now we just need a decent bass player. - There may not be one, anywhere. No, there sure aren't. Hey, snot nosed kids! Looking like that... We were just here thinking with the guys, that you're shit. Some shit fertilizer. Get the fuck out of here. You play some glam rock crap... You know, little kids like you, you've got small weiners - - and us hard rockers 'got cocks! There's a fuckin' difference! I say it straight: you're shit. Guys! Volume up! - One, two, three, four! Let's go a little louder. Now, you glam rock faggots. - They're gone? - Yep, Black widow's not home. You're good with the knife. - You've got to be fucking kidding me! Look at this! Who the hell likes a singing actor? - Samuli Edelmann - You're fucking kidding! - Look at what they got here. - Menthol toothpicks. Hey guys! The old dudes of Black Widow sure like coffee! - Come on, Antti! - Antti, don't you fucking... Tasty morning coffee for you! Slight fertilizer taste to it...! Fucking idiots. - What, got nothing? - On the contrary: Got them pitying my hard life and they gave me cash. Gotta help out the youngsters, you know. The fuck you looking at? - Can you go buy us some beer? - Why would I? Because you can get it. I fucking know that. Why would I get you twerps anything? Oh look it's the chipmunk boys! Do you think you'll get cash? - Dunno... Remember, we need a hundred. You have a business, so you have a livelihood. I told you that my business is dead. I'm being charged interest and I have no idea how to feed the family. Can't you see I'm up to my neck in shit? You can always fill that up. This is insane. We can't get welfare for anyone if this goes on. Hi. Are you busy? What do you want? Well, I was thinking... Can you give me a hundred? - A hundred? Seriously, I don't have that kind of extra cash. It's for a date. What? You have a date? - Yea. - Why didn't you say so. Who is it? Her name is Elli. We've been dating for a while but... When am I going to meet her? We'll see. Have a great date. See you. - Great date. - Heh Well it was half true anyway. Hey Pete! - Hi. You weren't kidding. She's the kind of girl you only see in videos. The one time a real gem winds up here, she goes and falls for an asshole. Let's go, come on. Right, now. Go and talk to her, damnit! The bank manager suggested a protection plan for currency loans. They said devaluation is possible, but I don't know what to believe. And those protection plans aren't cheap. I have a meeting, so I'll just get my stuff. Oh fucking hell! Who the fuck put toothpicks in our couch? Hey come on, relax. Have a cup of coffee that'll help. A nice cup of coffee. Fucking hell! Maybe they just got sick of looking at you? I bet that menthol felt nice and fresh up the ass! Hey guys. Sorry I'm late. It's ok, we haven't started yet. - What... what is this? - Don't we need a bass player? - Mandy is a bass player? - Yes, she just can't play yet. - There you go. - Thanks. Guys can help out with that. - Oh, hell. Let's start with the basics. - Okay. Punk in A. You get A like this. - Just this? - For a start, yea. Let's roll. Despite the currency leak, Secretary of the Treasury liro Viinanen - - assures us that devaluation isn't necessary. It's nice that the Apulanta-guys wanted me in the band. It's good that you have friends. - Hey, Matti. - Hey Do we have anything else than the kids' veggie crap? There's a liver casserole in the fridge. Have you seen Tuukka? I have no idea where he is. I'm glad Sipe asked me. He's wonderful. - Who, me? - You are too. Where the hell have you been? I haven't seen you in days. What do you care? And I haven't seen you here either. Someone around here is trying to earn a living. Save it for the factory. Just so you know: I'm doing freaking great. You deal with your own shit. - Where are you off to now? - How's it any of your fucking business? It kind of is. Maybe just for one night you could have dinner - at home with us, so Mandy can see a proper Finnish family. If the Rotary club wanted Mandy to see a proper family, they should've known this is the wrong house for that. Guys, don't start again. I didn't start, he did. You're not going anywhere. - You're not leaving. - Get off me! Tuukka! So what are you going to study? - I'm thinking of becoming a doctor. - Oh! - Yea. - That sounds good. At least doctors have jobs, no matter the economy. That's true. You've found yourself a nice and smart girl. Listen to her, maybe plan your life a little bit. Yea... I think Toni spends too much time with the band. I think she's right on that. You could start hitting the books. Whatever you want to study. - Yea. - Yea. Okay... - Should we put one here too? - Yeah. Come in. - Hi. - Yes? Me and my mates, we have this band. I was thinking the school could have a band night so we could play. Everyone could see how the exchange student plays. Amanda Gaynor is in your band? Yea, she's our bass player. Yes, well... Maybe we could arrange something. So we can play? I'll have to check a few things, but... Cool! Thank you. Yes, you are dismissed. And guys: play quiet. You shithead! ls that hag the reason you haven't called me? What gives you the right to talk to my girl like that? What gives you the right to treat me like garbage? You stood me up like five times and now this. I never promised you anything. Not my problem if you assumed things. - But you said I was your only... - Fuck off and get a life. Nona! Nona, wait! Wasn't that a little much? - The fuck it was. Can't stand it when they get clingy. - Oh, hi! - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine. I'm just helping my dad out. Ilona, take these to the car, will you. -Yea. Great luck, we got the strings half off. I know! I got two sets. Can you hear me back there? Welcome to the school's band night. - See, there's Simo. - And now, on the stage - our very own band, with our American - exchange student, Amanda. I present to you: Apulanta Go Simo, go Apulanta! Hello all, we are Apulanta. One, two, three, four. - Let's get out of here. - I'll stay for a bit. - What, for this? - Yea. Pretty good! - What did I say about the volume? - Yea, sorry. What's your problem? You have to play punk loud, that's the whole point! Yes, but in the future, turn the knobs a bit more to the left - - when you play here. - So we can still play here? Sure! This was very entertaining! Reminded me of my own youth, and the 70's and Sex Pistols. There's actually a youngsters' art happening - at 8-hall in Lahti, would you be into that? - That would rock! - Fuck, 8-hall! Of course we're into it! I mean great, thank you! - Yes. Great. Thank you. Let's go. Trust me, there's nothing between Mandy and me. It didn't look like nothing. Why would I care about Mandy when I already have the prettiest girl in town? - You do? - Yes, I do. Did you hear that... Hepe killed himself and his kids when he went bankrupt? Ilona was in my class. It's so weird - we just hung out a week ago, and now she's gone. What was he thinking. Or... I bet he didn't have it easy, with the company and all. Do you... miss your dad? You know, after... I didn't want to move here when dad died. But I'm glad we did. Since... I would never have met you otherwise. Sipe hey! Got some change? - Some. That should buy you coffee at least. - Well yea. What do you think, does "gorgeous guys" refer to you or me? Sipe. If I wasn't absolutely sure you are completely illiterate - I'd suspect you wrote to the paper. What? Somebody wrote about us? "What the hell is Apulanta?" my daughter started screaming: 'you always lecture about smoking and - drinking beer, and these guys don't do any of that...' And then it hit me: Fertilizer for the young people, indeed. Think about it guys: our band, in the paper. Hi. - Hi. - You alone? -Yea Are you crazy? You can't take those. I know you're having a hard time but why don't you just talk to Matti? - About what? - Like your... relationship? He's the last one I'd talk to. I don't know him and he doesn't care. Still. Maybe like a hobby or something? I'm worried about you. Now you calm down, and keep charming the small town boys. I know you like that. What about those? They don't need them anyway. Hey guys! Hi Mandy. So... How can you stand that asshole? - Tuukka? - Yeah, him. - Tuukka is fine. He's just... how do you say it, "misfit". - Misfit is... sopeutumaton. - Yea. Sopeutumaton. - He's not just a misfit. - He's just acting like a bad guy. Tuukka is fine, really. Oh I forgot! I have a gig. - You have a gig? - I mean, we have a gig. - We have a gig? - Yep. Matti asked me, and I promised we'd come. - Fucking great! - Cool, where is it? - Sorry, I don't know. - Who cares, like you'll be picky? Gig! We need the practice before 8-hall. The Mark has been devalued. The Finnish bank and government were forced to act - since the currency leaks continued. It can't be. - What are we going to do? - I really don't know. We're leaving now. Mandy left already. Please come. If not for your father, then for Mandy. I'll think about it. Everything's going to be fine. The bank manager. Go and talk to him. - I'm not going to do that here. - It's only polite to say hello. Hello, Matti. - How do you do. Devaluation, huh. Is there anything left that we can do? I hate to say it, but you should have gotten the protection plan. Quitting seems like the only choice now. We Rotary brothers look after our own, even in the worst of times. If I knew this was some rich guys' shit-do - I'd never have agreed to do this. You said that whatever gig we get is good. Hi there. ls everything all... rock rock? - Everything's fine, thanks. - Good. See you out there. Oh fuck, "rock rock"? Hey. Sorry I'm late. I know... just had to help out mom - with the coffee stuff and - Had to help out your mom, and that's why you're late for a gig. - Yes. - Right. - And then there's this. - No way! - You got engaged? - Congratulations! Yes. Yes we did. Right. Well. Welcome to the HEINOLA Rotary party. It is my joy and priviledge to introduce to you - our exchange student, Amanda, and her band. Amanda has brought us something new from the big world out there. Amanda and her band: Apulanta, take it away. We are Apulanta. This is fucked up! How dare they kick us off mid set? It's not the end of the world, there's 8-hall coming, and - I am so fucking fed up with your fucking sportscoat too! Why don't you go and have dinner with the rest of the snobs? I'm a little late for my engagement party. Go get engaged, what the hell else. Should we just... get drunk? Bye then. That is the best idea I've heard all day. Will you come too? Sorry, Pete's teaching me to skateboard. What took you so long? Where were you? On a gig. How was I supposed to explain it to the guests? - Come on now. - There's our Toni. Well, come on then. He's late because his band was playing at the Rotary party. Well hello there. Here comes a big log... Santapukki coming... Sorry, those two are not shy about making out. It's ok. Hey. You want anything? - Could we have a couple of beers? - Let's make it a couple of sodas. Come play with me. - Yea, play with her. - Yes. We have some band stuff with Antti. Play with Sepi. We'll get to play, I promise. - Bye then. - Bye. Reetta. Should we go rent a movie, maybe? There's some truly dumb people around here. Like these skaters. They'll pick a fight with anyone. What's the little rat squeaking, huh? You boozeheads got something to say? - Leave him alone. He's cool. - What? You gotta be kidding me. Do I look like I'm kidding? You'd better watch where you go, might get hurt. Why did he save your ass? - No clue. Actually I wrote a song - and I though we could play this at the gig. - The gig in Lahti? - Yea. - Let's hear it. ♪ I don't have no fancy clothes, ♪ ♪ or a flashy car ♪ ♪ And I don't have lots of money, ♪ ♪ but I hope that's fine ♪ Toni. Sit beside me... - Toni That's like the chorus part... So it's called "I hope I'm good enough, my love". -Yea. 'It means the world to be with you' 'If you like me too, just kiss me' 'Lay next to me, let's go to sleep' 'Good night.' 'Let's kiss.' Might be a bit soft for 8-hall. Do you think this represents Apulanta? Well... doesn't it? - The fuck it does. Listen - have you heard this song? We are not playing this shit at 8-hall. It wasn't finished. Maybe next time, Toni. It was... Yea it was really great. BAND COMPETITION, 8-HALL, LAHTI 1993 Woah. I knew that civilization starts outside of HEINOLA - but it's really diggin' out here. Look at that guy punishing that stick, he's so good. This is like soft pop compared to our stuff. I checked that they're ready for you guys. They're awesome. Hello you fuckers. We are Apulanta. That was better than sex! - Come on. - I mean, probably. Did you see how into it they were? - Those guys were so into us! Oh my geesh! - Oh hell no. - Oh hell. You rocked pretty hard out there. We were just saying the same about you. I'm Arska. I started a record label. It's called Record Label. Care to join in? - Hell yes, do you need to ask! This year's band competition has been settled. The winner is from HEINOLA - Apulanta! Antti said that a couple of my songs would make the record, too. Oh, Well? There's no long term plan in it anyway. It's pretty cool to get your songs on a record, though. But when we move out of HEINOLA, it'll be over anyway. Isn't that right? Hey... Guess what? I'd love it if you concentrated all that energy on me. What do you think about that? - Oh right. - Hmmh. Like all of my energy? - Every last bit. - Well, if only this once. - Okay. Have you thought about what happens when Mandy leaves? She'll go back to the states, and we have no bass player. I should do something about her. So what's going to be the 'grande finale' for your epic love story? I'm not impressed with your talents as a Casanova - especially since your first time was with your cousin. Ha ha guys. Hey boys! - Hi. - Hi. What's this? I wrote a song. It's called Silmämuna (Eyeball). - Oh wow. What...! You wrote it in Finnish! I want you to sing it. Seriously. - That was good. - Show me. Freaking great. Thank you! I'm going to miss, like, everything. HEINOLA, the band, the school... and Tytti, Matti and Tuukka of course. Gotta go. Elli's waiting. See you. Bye. Hey Toni wait! I have to talk to you, it's important. Ok, that was it. Thanks, Mandy. - Time to go. Remember what I said. The band needs, like, the best bass player. - I dunno, that whole idea seems weird... - Trust me. Mandy. Are you absolutely sure you have to go? I love you guys but I do have to go. Mandy, they're waiting for you outside. Bye then. Take care, guys! You know that an era of this band just walked out that door. Well, have a nice trip then. Umm... maybe we should wait in the car. - For who? Oh right! Come on when you're done. Why isn't Pete here to see you off? - Why? - Aren't you guys... an item? - What? Oh no, no. Pete is just a friend. - I thought you were... - No way. I was... into this one guy. But it wasn't mutual. You mean Temonen? Oh no, I have to go. Thank you. So awesome. - I feel like a rock star. It's cool, but that clipping is lame. It's not like we're Jesus or anything. If we are going to play, then we have to find a bass player. How about Pete? Pete plays bass, he knows us and what we're about - he hangs with us and knows our songs. - Mm, he's a good player. - Ls there someone else? Okay. If not Pete then who? I dunno. Right. We'll ask Pete. You do it tomorrow at school? - Alright. I'll ask tomorrow. - Good. Hey. Can I sit here? Temonen. Want to be a bass player? - What, in Apulanta? Mandy left an open spot. - I'm interested. - Yea sure, but I can't play. - I... I can play... - Neither could she. Yea ok. I'm game. Great. I thought I'd ask Tuukka to join the band. Absolutely not. That kid is pure trouble waiting to happen - - Yea yea but... - Don't even think about getting to... - Yea right. - I've heard all sorts of stories about him. - Mom. Hey! I already asked him. Well then. He's going to play bass for us and that's the end of it. Go get the milk. - Yeah, sorry. You can't do something that insane without asking us first - and didn't we agree that Pete was the best choice. You guys did. If you want go into details, the vote was tied. It was Mandy's idea to ask Tuukka to play bass. If Mandy wanted it then I'm ok with it. Am I late? Is there something going on? Nope. Good to have you here. There's your instrument. Let's start with the basics. Fuck this strap. First thing I'll change. So much cooler when the bass hangs down to your knees. I've never been so humiliated. You can't just fail and lose everything. I can't show my face outside anymore. We'll have to tell Tuukka. I have news. - Your dad has too. Well, out with it. The company is bankrupt. We've sold everything but we're still in debt. I think you deserve it. I just don't get that kid. Where did we go wrong? Hey! Are you not minding your sister? Come down off the couch right now! I'm thirsty. Come into the kitchen, I'll fix you some juice. Reetta, you can't keep jumping around like that... Sorry. She wanted to fangirl... I get it. Your dad's just worried about her heart. I think it's great you're hanging out together. Just take it easy next time. And she's not your only fan, or Seppo, cause I like you guys too and I'm - certain that you'll make it big someday. Make it out to Anniina. There. By the way, we had a bit of a hiccup - nobody fixed us a place to crash... would you happen to have room for a couple of rockers like us? Well... Our parents aren't home, so there's room. How cool would that be? Cool I think... Sure... it's cool. Ok, you guys can come. Too bad Elli isn't here. - Hmm. I did invite her. She had some school stuff. - Who, Pete? - No, Elli. I know you're in there! Come out and fight! Anniina! Oh hell, that's Jake. - Who's Jake? - My boyfriend. Oh fuck. Who's that? That car is about to tip over! Anniina, do you know that guy? Yea that's my boyfriend. Easy for him to yell like that - with an army at his back. He's got a pretty bad temper. Fucking hell! That's it. Leave the fucking car alone! Get the fuck off! What the fuck? Come on let's get out of here! Fucking faggots! What the hell, man? Yea, dude's crazy. Pretty fucking cool to have you on board. You must be Apulanta. - Yea. Hi. Saara Niemi. - Sipe. - Hello, Tuukka. Shall we wait for the guys? No, see Toni and Antti couldn't make it. Okay. They're in painting class, watercolours this week. I see. So you guys have other artistic prospects - in addition to music? Yea, we do. How... you're a punk band, right, so - how does that show in your everyday life? I wouldn't say we represent like the punk ideology - Like at all. It's... far too narrow minded for me. It's ridiculous that we should boycott multinational burger companies, or coke drinks, just because other punks do. I think the whole punk world is full of puritans. It's gotten pretty old and tired. I gotta add something. If there was a state of anarchy - I'd buy a tank and shoot everybody. Shoot... everybody? You are the most beautiful thing there is. I didn't write a poem, but... I did write a song. ♪ It was something like three years ago, ♪ ♪ we met at a fiend's party ♪ ♪ Roughly ten months after that, ♪ ♪ you agreed to wear my ring ♪ ♪ We finished school and settled down, ♪ ♪ but we couldn't find a job ♪ ♪ I did not know back then, ♪ ♪ baby, what I do know now ♪ ♪ I've probably been ♪ ♪ thinking 'bout it too long. ♪ ♪ When would I know how ♪ ♪ to tell you this ♪ ♪ I want us to have ♪ ♪ a pretty baby girl ♪ ♪ -baby- ♪ ♪ I love you so, baby ♪ ♪ will you marry me ♪ Our wedding day... - Why do you do that? It's not like we're starting a family or anything, come on. Do you think I write this stuff for fun? I applied for the computer class, just like you wanted. Just get it: I mean what I say. Can we do something else? Reetta, eat it, stop playing with it. Good morning. They're looking for school kids and - students to work at the factory. What if you got a real job? Luckily, I don't have to. We have gigs. Do they actually pay you to play bad music? Indeed they do. So I don't have to take a crappy job at the factory. Won't you understand that I'm a musician? Boy's got a mouth on him. Since when does HEINOLA breed rock stars? Come on. Oh hi. What the hell is your shit band talking about? - Are you like fake or something? - What are you talking about? Read that. Our interview. What the fuck. The anarchist union... are a bunch of unimportant rebels, Apulanta drummer Sipe says. Bass player Tuukka Temonen also comments, that the neo Nazi movement - at least has a point, albeit a dumb one. - Yea. - That's what it says. I don't know what this shit is. - Me neither. - Fuck, who does. I thought I had a great band, but you're just fucking around! Wha...? Didn't mean... it was just a joke. We didn't mean to, man... A joke?! Do you think the readers will get the joke - when the journalist fucking didn't? We have an actual chance to impact society - in these fucking interviews! I don't think the guys meant to - I don't care if they meant to fuck it up or not! You made it real clear that Apulanta doesn't care about the punk ideals - which happen to mean a fucking great deal to me! We'll write the magazine if you're gonna get a stick up your ass about it - You fucking stood up for Nazis instead of punk! I just said that I get where they're coming from - it's not like I stood up for them. They pretty much teach fascism at school, you know. - What the fuck? - You should've done the interview. We didn't realize you wanted to dictate what we should say. I started a band with a statement - and not some fucking amateur theater group. If you want to go on with that shit, by all means! Apulanta is nothing but a joke. Hei Antti, we're sorry. - Hey wait a minute. It can't end like this. Antti, come on... Reetta, please. Go bother Sepi. - He's asleep. Go bother dad then. Maybe Antti will change his mind. He won't. It kills me that I fucked it all up. I screwed up and now he doesn't want to hang out - and won't come play with us. Good thing we didn't buy those drums! There are always differences between friends. You've known each other since you were kids. One fight won't mess it up. I wouldn't say that. There's no use talking to him. If he made up his mind about us, then he's sticking with it. Still, even Sarasvuo says that a healthy relationship - any relationship, is a two way street, always helping both parties to grow. Life will maintain the relationships that breed good - ls that supposed to make me feel better? Not necessarily right now, but at some point in your life - you will see that you just grew apart. I think this is the end of the band. - Oh nonsense. You sleep on it, and I promise tomorrow will look brighter. We all hold the keys to our own success. Trust me. Change comes from within. You'll be bigger than Dingo some day - Sirkka! Call an ambulance, Reetta's having a heart attack! - Oh my god - Reetta, can you hear daddy We need an ambulance right now at Vuorenalustie 15 - Heart attack. It's ok, daddy's here. Where are her meds? Quickly! It's ok, daddy's here. Do you hear me... Thank goodness you're here. We'll go with her. Simo! Take care of Seppo. Hey. How's Reetta? She's ok. Just a scare. Good. That's good. I asked you here because I think - we should give the band a shot. We have a studio booked for recording. Are you in or out? I'm in. - I guess I'm in too. Fucking awesome. If we start rehearsing now, we're going to crush it in there. What are we going to rehearse? I wrote a song about Nona. "Not nice" and "To the sun" roll on nicely. But just like with Karkkiautomaatti, a professional producer - would have been useful, to reach the band's full potential. Teen girls will love it, which seems to be the point. "Three years" is too hard to listen for an adult. What about gigs? Interest is a bit slow. Let's see how the album sells. But, to be honest, I wouldn't count on it. Couldn't listen to your song, think about it. Maybe I was kinda... trying too hard. Trying at all was the problem. Antti was right, we're a joke. That shit don't sell. Well go ahead and write better songs then. You guys have more at stake anyway. I'm getting the fuck out of this town soon! You were right all along. You know, that - this band thing isn't my thing. I'm ready to start studying. We can move in together. Well I... don't really want to move anymore. You want to stay here? - Kinda, yea. - Okay. - At least for now. Well good. I've been meaning to tell you something, but I never found the right - time to say it. Toni, we're done. Sorry. What the hell happened to you? I never get anything right. If I did... maybe dad... I couldn't help him either. I was eleven years old. Coming home from school. I got home and... I saw that... Dad was just laying there - Sipe, it was my fault that he died! My fucking fault... I just want to write music, and play music - but I fucking can't... I can't do either. SIX MONTHS LATER There's my hard workers! How was your day? Less people means more work for the rest. I bet it does. Lucky you got these great helpers like Simo. He hasn't let me down yet. Paint horns on him! Dude, there's... Aren't you Simo? - Yea, Sipe Remember me? I substituted for your class. I remember. You're kinda hard to forget. - Well how are you? - A lot better just now. What about the people who have no jobs? They made their thoughts very clear... Fucking embarrassing to make Tytti work while you just lay there. Don't talk about things you don't understand. I understand that you do nothing all day. You are selfish beyond measure. Live free and never respect your parents. Young man, and not a... Welcome. Today we'll talk about MS-DOS, the worlds most widely used operating system - which you already know since you're here. It's used in development environments... There are two choices here. First is Turbo Pascal, the standard - and then there is Quick Basic... MS-DOS inherited many of the CPIM programs... Hey, Santapukki! - Yea? - You have a call. - Are you sure it's for me? - They asked for you. Simo Santapukki. Sounding important, now are we? Toni, dude. How's it hanging? You have reach the Temonen household. Leave a message after the tone. Hi. It's Toni calling for Tuukka - asking if he could come by the mill at seven. Thanks, bye. It's cancer. What's up? - Not much. Cool that you came back. - Yes. Apis is back. Is Tuukka coming? You called him, right? I called. He's coming. It's his band too. Fuck that's good. Do it again. You think you're the only one who can do that? Did I say that? What the fuck. Does that idiot have an off-switch? Dude's so full of himself. - Temonen, be cool. - Who's cool here, hu? Go sit down, man. Fucking clowns! - Who's yelling? The fuck... you goddamn well know who it is. We're taking you to cool down if you keep doing that. It's not my fault... Small dick cop. Fucking boy scouts... - Take it easy, boy. So tell me what happened here. Oh you know... I just fell off my board and hit my head. You're telling me that guy had nothing to do with it? - Maybe he saw me fall. - Right. Fine. Fuck! - So we're pretty much done. Fucking Temonen. I don't need a lecture. - I'm ashamed of you, son. - Lay off me, I told you. Have you been to see your father? Temonen, that fuck. I don't know what the hell I saw in that guy - or why I asked him to the band in the first place. He's the reason we're fucked. We could have been big, but oh no. I wish he'd just disappear and I'd never have to see him again. And I though I could quit studying and focus on the band. - So you dropped out of school. - Mm. I think I'm going to head home. See you sometime. What are you thinking about? Everything just sucks. The band not happening and all. And there's this old stuff I can't stop thinking about. A girl, you mean. Maybe it's not too late. - It is. I'm sure you'll find your true love. - I hope so. - I know so. Temonen! Temonen! How are you doing? You... you ask me how I'm doing? You're the reason the band is dead. Easy for you to say! You don't know what I've been through! You don't... know... How are you doing. You don't know what I've been through. Good morning. It's nice that you came to visit. I've got so few classes now that I can stay for a bit. Did you hear that Matti Temonen is in the hospital? It's cancer, the bad kind. Do you want something or did I come here for nothing? There is something. I wrote a new song. It's... more punk than the last ones. And pretty great actually, if you ask me. So I was thinking that - we could try again. - Does that make any sense? - You've got nothing to lose. If this doesn't work, then we can split up. At least we tried. Okay. We'll try. - Okay. - Sure. See ya. - Bye. Temonen! Wait up. I heard about your dad. I just wanted to say... I'm like... I mean, I do know what you're going through. Can you believe it! He quit his job at the factory. Goddamn it, in times like these! - He wants to focus on the band. - I thought that nonsense was over? Hey. Here's the video I was supposed to bring. I could maybe show a clip on the punk segment. No fucking clips. You either show all of it or none of it. Do you realize, who you went off on? I don't bow and scrape for show hosts. - That's something Antti would say. - Guys come look! You're on TV. With no further ado, here's Apulanta - with their video premier for the song "Mitä kuuluu". Simo, it's for you. Sipe. Guys, it's Arska. Everyone likes the song. We have a slot in the show and a shit ton of gigs. I should probably go. Too bad you dropped out of school. Don't worry, mom. It'll be fine. I promise. - Ok then. Your dad would be proud. Have a great gig. - Bye! - Bye. What the hell is going on here? Damn. ls there a band on after us? No way! It's Mandy! What? Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? Tuukka called me and said there's some unfinished business. I dug you, like, so hard. It wasn't Tuukka. The guy I liked. It was you. Why didn't you say anything? Silly. Ok, lovebirds. My turn! I hope there's at least a few people watching. There's gotta be some. Time to go. Ok, let's roll. Dear party people.- You wanted the best... And you got us. To think, it's our boy there on TV. My son. - So it is. It was me that wrote that piece in the paper. Of course I knew, I just didn't want to say anything. - You didn't. - Sure I did. "How you doing" became the hit that started - the success that continues to this day. Tuukka quit the band in 2005 to start his career in film making. Mandy is a dentist and lives with her family in Kentucky. She has four children, and enjoys country music. Antti is still punk, with his band Silent Scream. Apulanta is still one of the most successful bands in Finland. You know, if anyone's punk, it's us. This is the one you want. What I think this picture says, is companionship, friendship, and, kind of - sense on brotherhood that our band has, and I think a lot of bands have. I can't be -Apulanta!! We have an Emma award now - and we have 21 number one singles out, so now that I have the chance, I'd like to thank Toni - Thank you, Sami - I'm gonna thank Temonen. Thank you, Antti Lautala and Mandy - and Arska and Lotta, and most of all, thank you - all you people who buy our albums, and come to our gigs. New adventures await.
