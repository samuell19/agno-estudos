Hi. The super told me you were here. You're Rina's sister? Yes. These are her keys. These two are for this door, this is downstairs, and this one's for the rooftop. Thanks. We had... given each other keys. I had given her mine. Just in case something happened. I did her nails last week. She wanted to dye her hair to look more elegant. She taught me how to knit. She was very special. Well... One of a kind, magical. I saw her last week. A FAMILY SUBMERGED This one. Do you like it? It seems right for a quinceañera. - I'll iron this one out. - Or maybe this one. No need to iron this one. You can just wear it, you straighten it out and you're all set. I'll iron this one out, you choose later. Wait, come. I have another one. I have another shirt, look. Look. You're shameless, you can totally pull off something like that. - What's wrong with it? - It's not for a quinceañera. It's "carnival rock & roll" style. It's perfectly right for a party. Look. Hi, Emi. I'm the magician. I've gotten you a present. I'm a dove! A dove that flies and flies. Fly and fly with the dove. Mom, have you seen my colors? Which ones? - The watercolors? - No, the paint dyes. - Did you check the laundry room? - I did. Not there. Is there a burning smell? I'll iron out this one and you can choose later, okay? Okay. Mom brought tons of plants from Rina's. They're in the living room. Careful with my knee. I have this farewell party outside of the city. A friend is going abroad. I asked you to lend me the car five days ago and you said yes. No problem. Take it. Discuss it with your sister. Look at those bodies. Sure. They're athletes. I love that scarf. It's mine. Excuse me, I'm gonna wear it. Sorry. Are you taking Nahuel to the birthday party? Yes, I was told to. Because I need the car. I have this farewell in the outskirts. Who's leaving? Nacho, a friend of Diego's. He got a job. He's moving abroad. - What's that dish? - What? - There was brownie in it. - Right. It was old, I threw it away. No. That's Rina's dish. I don't want it to get lost. Let's move it to another dish. No, mom, it's a mess. It's gonna break out. I'll bring it back. Mom... It looks better like this, look. A rocker. Even higher? What about that? - What? - It's Rina's. Yeah, I know. She gave it to me. And you're already wearing it? Yes, Jimena, so what? - Look in the mirror. - She gave me nothing. I was there for her a lot. - Like this? - Yes, you're ready. - Can I come to the farewell? - I'm not sure there's enough space. - I need the bathroom. - Why, who's coming? - I'm gonna shower. Come on, stud. - You leaving already? Yeah, in a little while. Come on, handsome. Whose farewell is it? Nacho, a friend of Diego's. Nacho? Where's he going? Costa Rica. He got a job in a big company. - What is it? - A barbecue. - What should I wear? - No idea. Look at me. Nahue, hurry. What's with the washing machine? It broke down. I found a piece of land. What piece of land? I found the deed for a plot that my parents bought before the divorce. We used to go there as kids. I remember that my mom... had planted some trees, eucalyptus trees. What's there now? I don't know. What does Daniel think? - I don't know. Why, what for? - He's your brother. Half brother. He'll be right down. - Should I call the plumber? - Yes. It's better that way. I'm sorry for leaving now. I'll help you with everything when I'm back. Can I rely on you? Of course you can. Always. - Call me as you arrive. - Sure. I will. Bye. Luisa, what is it? Diego and I... broke up. He doesn't want to see me anymore. - Easy... - He says I'm bad for him. - I want to kill myself. - No. Easy... Breathe in. How was it? At the barbecue? Easy... Pichi who? Oh, right! Daniel's brother-in-law. How are you doing? Yes, Rina's passing was so sudden. Can I ask you a favor? Can you call me some other time? I'm busy right now. Sure, I'm taking notes. Sure. Yes, yes. All right, then. Thanks, bye. So, what is it? I have no clue of the problem. It's spinning. You'd better call my dad. - Hi. - Hi. - This is for the lab experiment. - I'm leaving. - All right, bye. - Bye. I'll pay you back later, okay? No, don't worry. It was free. I took it from my dad. I did a day-to-day study plan to be on the safe side. It's a tight schedule. The test is on the 8th, it's hard work. Chemistry, lunch break, Biology. - Literature, Physics... - I'll be right back, okay? Okay. Nahuel, move it, get up. Gaby is here. You didn't say she was coming. Had you told me, I would've come earlier. It's Brazu. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. You're Brazu, right? Jime... Hi. Pichi told me he saw you last night. What was he doing there? He's about to shower! Gaby is waiting for you! - How rude. - Shut up. Go shower. Fast, come on, hurry! What was he doing there? His daughter owns the weekend house. - So, you told him to call me? - No, he asked for your number. Was uncle Daniel there too? No, just us and Pichi. What's the deal with Luisa? She broke up. You packed your bags for nothing! You're not changing bedrooms. Yes, I am! I am. Where's my dish? I don't know. At Nacho's. You're such a big girl! So big. You drive and all. I was scared yesterday about you taking the car. Could you bring my dish back? - Mom, T-shirt! - Huh? Take the car, go by the laundromat, and bring back what's left there, okay? Okay. You are two drops, made of propylene glycol and colorant, in water. You have more propylene glycol and colorant. You have more water. - You have more... - Solute. And you have more...? - Solvent. - Excellent! Propylene glycol is more volatile. What does it mean? It explodes. No. It pushes the joints. It releases them. It escapes from the liquid and turns into a vapor. Liquid to gas. - Hi. - Let's talk after this, okay? Sure. So, how many molecules are escaping? Focus, Nahuel. How many molecules are going to evaporate? I don't know. It depends on the drop's needs of having more gas of its own nature around it. Is that clear? - Yes. - No. Let's say I have two drops, each of them with a different proportion of solute and solvent, and, as a result, different... Vapor pressure levels? Good. Different vapor pressure levels. What's next? What will the drops do? - Blend in? - Good. They will try and blend into one drop that has the same vapor pressure level around it to create a more stable scenario. Okay? Look here. See what happens? I'm going out to Rina's. It's great. See how they're trying to blend in? Chase each other. I'm ready. Well... We have climates, biomes, mountain regions, species, flora, fauna, biodiversity, globalization and regional economics. It's not that much. I'll help with what you know better. What is it? Unit 8. If I say... "subtropical, no dry season"? Misiones and Corrientes. Temperature is... over what? 30ºC. - 20ºC. - 20ºC. What about precipitation? Yes, there is that. High, low? Think. “No dry season.” High. What type of flora can be found? It's... subtropical... forest. Wait, I'm looking for it. Where can you find it? In... Jujuy, Salta and Tucumán. Hold on. Precipitation? In the summer. Good. Let's move on to the mountain regions. Mountain climate goes... from... I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry. I love you. No, your son didn't know. We could hear the machine rattling and then stopping. And then back to rattling and stopping. Yes, please. Let me write it down. Hold on a second. Tuesday, 10:30 am. Right.. Is this tomorrow? No, right. The day after! There's people all the time in the afternoon. Okay, but please come. All right. Yes, bye. Thank you. Hello, what's up? I'm Nacho. Luisa's friend. - The farewell party boy. - Right. I'm sorry, but my washing machine broke down... I disconnected the washer hoses. Now the plumber tells me it's the pipes. That everything is connected, and the pipes are damaged. - Do you have an ashtray? - Yes. So many good books here. My dad used to read this one to me when I was a kid. That one is all marked. There's a bunch of books at my sister's, if you want them. Do you do something related to this? No, I just love reading. You know a lot. I went to this high school with specialization in mechanics and electricity, that's why I know some stuff. Like this. Split. I would've sent Nahuel to a school like that. - I was ill-advised. - They're not that great. My school was good. It was okay. The farewell barbecue was for him. He gave us laundromat money. We owe him. I'll pay him back. Don't worry about it. We'll be back soon. Let's go, Brazu. We've discussed the conditions. Nahuel! We are not vacationing because of you! What's wrong, Jimena? Are you mad because you're stuck in your room? It's not me, it's because of Rina! - Give that to me! - Come on, Jimena. What is it? - Leave it! - Give it to me! Stick it up your ass! Take it. Asshole! Hey! It's okay. Let's go, Brazu. We'll be back. I think this was the problem. All right, thanks. Can I have a cigarette? Tell me about your trip. No. I mean, yes, but I'm not going. I got a call and was told I'm not going. The trip got cancelled. Why? Something came up. “You need to understand... these things happen in companies like this." But I really can't do anything with that. I completely shut my life here. I left my apartment, my relationship, my dog, and... Ah! Oh! Are you okay? You'd better sit. How awful. - Have some water. - No. Are you okay? I'll let you out. I'll go downstairs with you. Thanks. I hope you can finally go on this trip. I think it was final, I don't think I am. Thanks anyway. - If you want the books, tell Luisa. - All right, thanks. Get well. - Bye. See you. - Bye. The peak sublime deedless climb if you are wise! The path... leads you to a wonderful forest. So deep, so wide, no bound's descried. This forest's bare of then or there. In its own singularity. This forest... ...no foot did pace. It is near... It is far... Little girl... don't be sad. Don't be so sad. Girl... Do that you did the other day, the flying thing. Icarus! I breath in and look down at the rooftops. I start flying. I elevate... Meters... One, two, three, four, five thousand! Fly! Fly away. Careful! One, two, three, four, five thousand! Fly! Oh! Fly! Into the light! I eat the light and die! - Nacho called. - Who is that? Luisa's friend, farewell guy. What did he want? To go to Rina's for some books. Can I go? Sure, why not. - Want me to order ice cream in? - Yes! - I won't go downstairs. Chapeau! - Chapeau! It's Jimena's turn again. It's my sister's notepad. I didn't know she sketched first and then knitted. Nobody can make good use of this. I don't knit, my children don't knit. "A tea pot and a wash cloth, two handbags, one for Blanca... Two summer dresses for my girls, Rina and Marcela". I never got mine. That's my mom. In her lambswool coat. At San Julián. She was a teacher. What about this one? That's on my dad's birthday, at Centro Navarro. That is my sister Rina, with lots of make up. This one's so pretty. She was a contortionist. She fell for a pharmacist and eloped to the forest with him. I don't know who this man is. There's no one I can ask. They're all dead. We are Blanca and Cecilia, your aunts from Lomas. Would you like a cup of coffee? Sure. How was the rhyme? Look. Clara and Berta Yusen. Edith Porto. Santo and Esther Minusi. Look. David. Check this out. Sergio and Judith as little kids. - So cute. - So little. - Look. - Let me see. Look, do you remember this man? That man was Mr. Jorge. He came to the reunion too. This man is dead. - You remember Pérez? - Yes, perfectly. We would laugh at it, Pérez, Pérez... This was her husband... - Pérez Pérez. - How was the name? Yes. Pérez, Roberto, something like that. Rogelio and Esther Rosatti. A present from my mother. Fortunato Masa. Fortunato Masa... Do you want me to tell me the story? She wanted to go to Europe... His hairdo. Don't you remember? The oceans she saw: Tyrrhenian Sea, Adriatic Sea, - the Mediterranean, - Naples, Venice, Pompeii, - Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea. - Minos, Crete, Knossos Palace. The English Channel. A wonderful trip. - Who paid for it? - What do you think? What? All of us paid for it. Don't you remember? She said she didn't feel good because she was lonely. We all chipped in. Your brother gave her the money. What brother? Mom! - No, no! - What brother? Mom, phone call! Mom! Be careful. Take good care of it. They're supposed to open at 9, but nobody's picking up. - What are you doing now? - Hang up. I'm going to Rina's. - Can I come with? I wanna help. - Okay. Take that off, Jimena. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here? I asked him for help. Come in. Gaby invited me over to her house. Everybody's gone. And, also, Nahuel is taking up all the space with the studio and all, and I need my own space, you know? Okay. Is that okay? - Bye. - Bye, see you. We brought all of dad's stuff I had mentioned. Trophies, cups, photos... There's a restaurant here too. - Yes, ma'am. - Food's really good. Oxtail. The owners have changed. It's different now. That was before. The owners are new. Do they celebrate San Fermín here too? Yes, it's the main local celebration. In the dining room and in the courts too sometimes. - One minute, I'll go to the restroom. - Sure. They called me Krabeli which means carnation. Are you aunt Elma from Río Cuarto? I'm Fanny, Mateo's sister. Hello. Hello! - I'm going to Gaby's. - Now? Nahuel got hit, that's why I'm late. - What happened? - It's all right. Bye. - What happened? - Nothing. What do you mean? I fell off the bicycle. - I was riding quite fast. - Can you hold still? - Luisa, be gentle. - Did you bleed a lot? - Let me do it. - He's fine! But let me finish up. Move over, please. Did you disinfect thoroughly? Yes, I used iodopovidone. - But you're hurt here too. - Yes. I'm going to Brazu's. His dad invited me over for dinner. Stay, I'll make something yummy. Luisa's taking me. Yes, I'll drive him. I have to go out too. He must be cooking already, so... - Did you hit your head? - No. - No, don't look at me. - I'm not. We called you a couple of times. Where's your phone? No... I left it by accident. Are you meeting up with Diego? No, I'm going out with a friend. Daniel called to confirm we're doing it here. But I didn't say we were. I told him we are. We'll have turkey. Should we go, Lu? - Bye, mom. - Bye. - Bye, mom. - Bye. Hello? Hi. Good, what about you? No, Nahuel fell off the bike, but nothing happened. He passed out for a little while, but he's fine. Okay. How much longer? All right, then. Don't worry about it. The thing is everybody thinks I'm away. That's the problem. I don't know what to say. I'm really embarrassed about this. What's your plan? For starters, I'm spending all of my savings... to pay for the hotel here. But... I'd rather use the money to travel... It'd feel good to go away. Where would you go? Far away. Maybe to the beach... or the mountains. What about you? Where would you go? South. If I find a nice place, I'll invite you guys over. You could visit for a few days. Your laughter is contagious. Turn around. Now again. My memory is foggy. But the name was wrong or something... Look what they did. - Hello. - Hi. 107, please. Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. Want a cigarette? I used to know this poem by heart back in high school. "Her eyes are the same As a statues’s gaze And, for her voice, distant, Mild, and serious, She has the inflection of dear voices That were silenced." Come have some pie. Here. There's not much left, but I'm baking a fresh badge. I knew a lot of people would come. Pedro, some pie? Don't worry, it's lightly salted, you'll be just fine. You're playing a little bit, right? You have to listen to him, he's such an amazing musician. Fanny, how are you doing? I've heard your husband left you. No, my husband didn't leave me. I left him, a totally different story. Don't be mean. Good, spinning. What did you feel? I didn't understand what it was at first, but, really, light, whiteness, plants. Weren't you scared? Nature loves to disguise itself. Excellent. Good. Slowly. It's coming out. Cousin Luisa. I have something to show you. My button collection. It's superb. Look, pick the one you like, and you can have it. That's crazy Betty. She is Pedro Schwartz's mistress. I lost a jar in the kitchen, I can't find it. I have no idea where I left it. Inside the pantry, or where else. Where did I leave it? I'm looking for it everywhere. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Nothing? - No, no, nothing. - You have to tell us. - No. I'll tell you later. - We're your aunts. - Some other time. We run a general store there. This kid came on the boat and doesn't speak the language. They're so tiny. I can't take them off. They're everywhere. The store has plenty too. They have little eyes on them. Like insects. They're everywhere. I don't know what to do with them. "Leads you to a wonderful forest. So deep, so wide, No bound's descried. This forest's bare Of then or there In its own singularity. This forest No foot did pace, No creature mind Ingress can find. It is... Yet truly none knows what. It is here, It is there, It is far, It is near, It is low, It is high. Yet all we know is This it's not and That it's not. Clearness, brightness, Darkness." - You got it? - Yes. I got it. - Hi. - Hi. Marcela? Yes, she's here. - Hi, how are you? - Hello. Here... - Come in. - Hi, come on in. Well, I've set aside... dad's dresser, these boxes here, there are some tea sets inside, if you want them. - Sure. - There's this coat rack. How's everything going? Good? Mm... I found the plot deed from El Alfar. Remember that? Yes, I was pretty little. But I remember dad talking to my mom about it. Did she ever go there? Yes, it would flood during the winter. It's a worthless area. - I'm going there. - I'll let them out. Good. This is for you too. It's fragile, just be careful. You've cleared it all out. I meant to come and help, but I was away. A busy couple of months. High season. Rina was really suffering, it's better that she left like this. They made everything they could. You know how I feel about you? As if the stork had brought you. You are completely clueless. I'm not talking right now. You're impossible to talk to, with no witnesses, no way. On her last days she said to me, “Dad is like a mustached beetle flying over my room.” She felt that way about him. He was not a good father for us girls. What about the photos? Photos are a mess I still need to fix. I want copies. And I'd like to have the painting dad did. I gave it away. It was awful. How would you feel if someone found your grandmother's letters and keeps them from you for being awful? I've set aside psychology books for Irene in that red bag. Take them. - Can I give you a lift? - We'll stay here to finish up. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, see you. - Bye. He only cares about the commercial value of the plot. Now he plays nice in front of my kids. He wants us all to get together. As I want to discuss something, he beats around the bush. He says he wants a witness. The trees must be tall and I don't even know if the plot is still there. Yes, it must be there. Let's go, if you want. We go and you confirm it. Yes, here. - Should I pull over? - Yes. We could ask someone. This is the one we want to find. This is... - ...that. - We came from there. And we walked past this one here, where the boats were. I'm sorry. I don't know where we are. I don't know where we are! Didn't we take this road before? This one, Barrabacini? No, we came from here. Here, the creek. This one. We need to get to this road with no name. Nacho? - Ah! - What's up? Wow! So happy to see you! We were in the area, so I thought I'd drop by. Always surprising me. How are you doing? Long time... - This is Paloma, my... - Aunt. Aunty. - How are you? - Hello. - Something to drink? - Sure, yes. Look at Nacho! - You cleared this out. - All of it. Titán made me do it. It's all scattered about somewhere. - It looks good. - Great! See? Plenty of space now. And here, look... - Right, good. - See? - It's great. - We cleaned up. - How are you? - Good, this is so nice! Careful with the handrail and the second step, it's a bit loose. How's Sergio doing? The weed is eating up his house. The plants have grown so much. To the guests! - Cheers. - Cheers! What did you do? A little walk along the river bank. - Did you swim? - How could we swim? No. She is a great swimming teacher. They met in Brazil. I can do it. I'll do it. - The pathway has much more... - Light. - You can find little animals too. - He paints portraits. It's the dream-state night tonight. Outstanding. Don't make fun. I must've led you with my mind. What about my poet? I have something of your mom to show you. Bring it over. No, come. I have something of your mom to show you. How's everything? Volatile and mysterious. Let's push the table aside. "Todo y Nada" Titán! What's with you? You'll go in the trash! Get out of here! I wrote your grandmother a song. I know, Pedro. Hello. What are you doing there? - You startled me. - I've just got in. Hi! - I asked to be let go early. - Why? I was a bit worried, I don't know. Something in your voice. Why? - How was work? - Good. - How is Nahuel doing? - Good. Good, it was shocking, that's all. But his bike got stolen. Let's go on a trip. Okay, where to? I don't know, some place strange. With the kids? Yeah, all of us. Why are you rubbing it? To make it more tender. - You have to try and... - Can I touch it? It depends. Only if you're trying to help. Not if you're trying to smash it. So... Good morning. - Hey, dad. - Good morning, dad. - Hi. - What's up, dad? - How was work? - What's this? For the family thing. - What thing? - Pichi and Daniel's family reunion. I brought some presents for you. Let's see if you like them. This one's for you. And this one's for you. Thanks. I love it! - So? You like it? - It's great. It's awesome. I love it. So nice! Thanks, daddy! Thanks, dad! love you. So, Nahuel, what do you think? I'm not sure, dad. - I'm not into this. - All games are interesting. It reads, "For kids 9 to 11." Ignore that. That's just in the box. If you want, we can trade later. Can I show you how to inject this? Show me that bump of yours. A little wine. Let me read it... Use iodopovidone. Are you using it? Yes, I am. You pressure gently. You gotta keep that clean. Hand me the... What? - Butter. - What? The butter. Butter! Hi! I have something for you too. Here. - Let's see if you like it. - How nice. Thanks. - This is pure oregano. - It's ruined, right? I don't live here anymore, haven't you noticed? Did you touch it? - Well... No one told me that. - No one noticed. Where are you staying? - This little girl never speaks out! - She went to Gaby's. You buttered me! Right, Jime? Did you talk to your father when you were a kid? Did you talk to him? What kind of question is that? Did you tell personal stuff to your dad? What was it like? - Did you talk feelings with him? - No, we didn't talk much. - What was it like? - It was different back then. You didn't talk to your parents like you do now. That's why he doesn't talk to us. That's what he knows. What's wrong, mom? Nothing, I'm thinking. What about that family reunion the kids are talking about? I didn't organize it. Luisa did everything. Alright, then! It's off. We're aborting plans! Not happening. Not doing it. I'm canceling! - Are you upset? - No, Nahuel! I'm not upset. Take care of your things, go study. - Where did you leave it? - In the fridge. All right, I'll take a shower now. I'll go in the shower. What? We leave it in the fridge for a half hour. It's not supposed to get too cold, just a bit cold before we put it into the oven. Preheated, on a slow burn. I've set the desk aside for you already. Listen, we also have a three seater sofa with green patterned upholstery, finished in wood, Spaniard tacks. It's really nice. Well... something around 1.70 x 0.60 m. I'm looking for Ignacio. Room 107. No, I don't think he's in. Thanks. What about your grandma? - She came from Istanbul. - What about him? He worked, sold stuff. He had this cart and sold... olive oil. He was a peddler. They had to share one potato between bubbe and her four kids. What about uncle Mateo? The one you always mention. He moved to Mendoza. I didn't get one right. But, what kind? Did he carry produce? That'd be a produce store. I remember your dad saying that when he was little, your mom would feed the seltzer man. He was on his route, and he'd get soup. So she was very nice! I mean, she would offer everything she had. No... When Mateo got a job, they weren't poor anymore. Rina told me that your grandmother had other men. Don't start with that, it's not true. - We don't know. - Yes, we do. No, nobody knows. Yes, I think that's true. They used the little room in the back of grandma's house as a lodge. Pedro Schwartz lived there. He was her lover. He was a discreet man. He'd vanish if grandpa was around. Everybody knew about it. I heard it from the aunts. Our father was not grandpa's son. Don't say those things. Take a look at his features and you'll see it. Thing is... our dad was living in denial. - Don't say that. - He didn't want to know. No, I disagree. Completely. - Nothing but rumors. - It was real. Did you see them? No. Grandma would spend entire summers in Pueblo Irigoyen. Why would she go there? Because she didn't like... ...her life. She didn't like the family life. She'd rather go away. Still, you're just assuming about people that are not here to defend themselves. All right, I want to thank you all for coming today. Everything was really nice. It's so nice we're all here. We're the remaining ones in the family. We're still here. We're alive. Food was great, Luisa. - I helped her. - What did you do? - I buttered the poultry and injected it... - "The poultry"? I'll speak my mind from outside. Having a family had made her happy. She told me they went to the movies by the hand. People would go, "What a nice couple. It's so nice to have that." I don't agree, they were not a nice couple. She was in pain, it was hard for her. She was sick all the time. Not only that, she even tried to kill herself one time. Mom... What? Take it easy. She had good times and bad times. Like we all do, right? - Exactly. - A toast! Well, maybe I wasn't clear enough. All I'm saying is that they were special. - All right. - That's it. Can I help you? Pichi, what would you like to hear? - I can choose one. - You follow me. Do you go dancing? Is this warm? - Careful with that. - Should I get some ice? - Not that much. - Let's get some ice. Let's go get ice. - Cheers. - Cheers. Don't be a bore, dance a little bit. Let's keep our word.
