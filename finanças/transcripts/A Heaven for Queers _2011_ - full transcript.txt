[RAINFALL] [MUSIC PLAYING] [HEAVY BREATHING] [MOANING] -What's wrong with me? Why can't I just be normal? Why am I laying here jerking off to a gay porn magazine and fantasizing over some gay porn star who calls himself Hunter Ramrod? This is so not Christian behavior. If there really was a Jesus watching over me right now, he'd probably be pretty disappointed. He'd be so grossed out. Well, that's enough sin for one night. Time for bed, Hunter Ramrod. -Wake up, Matthew. -Hunter Ramrod? -Yes, Matthew. I need you to wake up. I need to be with you. -But how'd you get in here? I'm so confused. -While you've been watching me in the magazine, Matthew, I've been looking right back and watching you. I've watched you reach down in your pants and stroke your long, hard cock, fantasizing about being with me. It doesn't have to be a fantasy, you know. Fantasy only goes so far. The real thing is so much more fulfilling. That's what you want, isn't it Matthew? The real thing? Rather than having to stroke your own cock, why don't you let me do it for you? -Oh, wait. No. I mean-- -Oh, come on, Matthew. You can't tell me you don't want to be with me. I know the truth, remember? I've watched you. Oh, wait. I know what it is. You're nervous. It's your first time and all. But don't worry. You'll be a natural. I can tell. I know all the things you've fantasized about, Matthew. And don't you worry. I'll all come to you just as naturally in real life as it does in your fantasies. How does that one fantasy go? Oh, yes. You're so eager to get at my hot, juicy cock that you can barely contain yourself. But you're not one of those guys who wants to get right down to business and start sucking. Not you, Matthew. You want it to be sweet and romantic. You're such a gentleman. Don't worry. I may be a porn star, and I might occasionally do a butt sex gang bang video here and there, but I, too, am a romantic at heart. I can be soft and sweet, just the way you want me to be. [KISS] Well, now that we've got that of the way, time to let the sucking begin. -No, wait. -What now? Go ahead and tell me you don't want to. I can leave, you know. -I-- I want to. -I thought so. -But-- -But what? What if-- I mean-- what about Jesus? -Jesus? You're going to turn down Hunter Ramrod for Jesus? You don't even know if you believe in Jesus, Matthew. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life afraid to be yourself, afraid to enjoy yourself, all because of a guy you don't really know if you believe in? What about Jesus, Matthew? What about Jesus? I'll tell you about Jesus. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) If I had Jesus in my pants, would you want Him? If I had Jesus in my pants, would you need Him? Would you love Him? Hold hands and spoon and turtle dove Him? If I had Jesus in my pants, would you touch Him? If I had Jesus in my pants, would you hold Him? Would you squeeze Him? Grab on tight and try to please Him? But I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. But I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. If I had Jesus in my pants, would you hug Him? If I had Jesus in my pants, would you smooch Him? Would you kiss Him? Slip him the tongue, show him you miss Him? If I had Jesus in my pants, would you pet Him? If I Jesus in my pants, would you stroke Him? Would you spank Him? Not in a bad way, but to thank Him? But I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. Oh, I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. What I have in my pants won't heal sick or turn water into wine. But some say it's magic cure. What I have in my pants won't [INAUDIBLE] absolve you of your sins. But it might bring you back to life. But I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. But I guess that won't be. 'Cause I don't have Jesus in my pants. I don't have Jesus in my pants. I don't have Jesus in my pants. I don't have Jesus in my pants. -Wait. [SIGHS] OK, Hunter Ramrod. I'll make you a deal. You stop invading my dreams, and the next time I fantasize about you, you can have your way with me. Deal? Good. [KISS] MATTHEW: So, uh, what do you guys want to do now? You wanna go for a bike ride? We could get some ice cream. My treat. School's over. We've graduated. It's officially summer. We gotta get started on those summer ice cream trips. -Ooh. Ice cream. -You sure know how to get Brandon excited. -Just Brandon? Cause I'm picturing a hot fudge sundae with brownie pieces and cookie crumbs on the top. -OK, now you've got me really excited. But we're gonna share a sundae, cause there's no way I'm eating a whole one by myself. Well, I've been working out like crazy. I don't wanna be chubby on my wedding day. I wanna look all ripped and muscular for Stacy on our wedding night. -You stud. -That's exactly the words I want to hear come out of Stacy's mouth when she sees me for the first time naked. -You have nothing to worry about. The way Stacy looks at you, you know, that's complete and total love. You can have a big old belly from eating 10 hot fudge sundaes and she'd still think you were hot. -Yeah, you're right. But I'm still gonna like it all ripped and muscular to, like, be safe. Um, so anyway, uh, me and Stacy like really wanted to thank you guys for always being so supportive of us and always like being there for us. Like when me and Stacy first started dating and we always used to get into those little arguments all the time, you two would always, like, conspire to make sure that me and her could can get through all that stuff. Because you saw how good we were together. I think you guys knew that me and Stacy were meant to be before me or her even did. And just because I'm getting married, that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop being here for you guys. Which brings me to something that I've noticed-- um-- Matt, is there something on your mind? Because it seems like something's been bothering you. -Nah, I've just been thinking. -About what? -Different stuff. -Do you wanna talk about it? -Yeah. You know, part of me really does want to talk about it. I'm a little scared of how you guys are gonna react. -Well that's something you don't have to worry about. Me and Brandon are totally here for you. -Well, it's not just one thing. But a big part of it is I'm starting to wonder how much I really fit into it. -Fit into what, Matthew? -Into the whole Christian thing. -OK. You totally have to explain that one. -Well, I have pretty cool parents, right? I've got the two best friends anyone could ask for. I live in a nice house, and I grew up with a lot of things that kids in other parts of the world don't have. But somehow I just feel like I'm different, like different from you guys, like with your conviction on what you want to do with your life and with your religion and your relationship with Jesus. I just-- I just feel like I'm different, especially with Jesus. I mean, I remember being real young and being in church that day. There was this big push to get everybody saved who hadn't already been saved. And the preacher was talking about how we couldn't just take it for granted that you were saved. And you couldn't be like those false Christians who just thought they were Christian because their parents and grandparents were Christian. And I wanted to do it, too, you know? I wanted to make my parents happy. I wanted them to be proud of me. And I wanted to know Jesus, too. I wanted to know Him in the way they talked about Him, you know? It sounded so nice, so beautiful. So I got up there. And I said it. I said that I was accepting Jesus into my life. But I don't know if anything happened that day. I don't know if I was saved. I don't know if maybe the timing was off, and I was too young. Or maybe Jesus just doesn't want me. -Well one thing's for sure is that Jesus wants you. There's no question there. Now listen, Matt. I can't get inside of you and tell you what happened to you that day. But that's something you have to figure out on your own, something you have to deal with yourself and maybe even pray about. And if you would like, I'd be more than happy to pray with you. And I'm sure Brandon would be more than willing to pray with us. -Oh, heck yeah. -Another thing's for sure is that you do fit in. You're not a true Christian? Matt, you act more Christian than most Christians that I know. You're a good person. You're honest. You're good to all your friends and you're polite to your parents and to others. And you're always the first to jump in and work when our youth group is doing a fundraiser or community service. And you know the Bible pretty darn well. Other than that, you're an all-around fun guy, and your personality has that way of uplifting those around you. But being a good guy isn't what gets you into heaven, Matt, and me and you both know that. It would be really unfortunate if you did go through the rest of your life without ever having been truly saved, but there's no shame in it to admit to yourself that maybe you did feel pressured into getting saved that day. And maybe because of that, it didn't happen for you. But that offer is still there, the offer is still extended to you. Don't think just at that moment it didn't happen. Don't think you blew it. Don't for one second believe that you do not have another chance to ask Jesus to enter your life again. Maybe it's the possibility that maybe you were saved and you're just unsure. Maybe it's the case that you have to affirm your desire for salvation in a personal relationship with Jesus as an adult. You have to make it real, not because your parents or wanna just because everybody else around you is doing it. But it has to be because you want it. It has to be there, and it has to be with Jesus, and it has to be real. Is any of what I'm saying here getting through to you, hitting the mark? -Brandon, what's the matter? -Matthew, [SNIFFS] I remember being there that day all those years ago. You were right. We were just kids. We were what? Five years old? I remember wanting to be like the other kids that were getting saved. I wanted to be like you, Matthew. [SNIFFS] But I was just overwhelmed and couldn't grasp the concept of being saved at all. I just sorta stood there and cried. Getting saved for me didn't truly happen until a few years later. But when it happened, I knew it was for real. And all this time, I thought you had that same feeling of certainty that I did. And that you even found it long before me. Well, it looks like I was wrong. And it makes me sad to think that you've been living without that certainty all this time. I want you to have that certainty, Matthew. I want you to know it. I want to know that you're saved and that you're going to get into heaven when you die. Whatever Ican do to help you, I'll do it. -But no pressure, right? -[SNIFFS] Yeah. No pressure. -It wouldn't do any of us any good to pressure you, Matt. You need to accept Jesus for your own free will. But we could be there for you, and we'll pray for you. You can count on that. -Yes, you can. -Matt. -Yeah? -Yeah, ooh, um, you said that there was something else on your mind. Do you want talk about it? -Yeah, maybe. But let's just save that for another day. I've done enough of this emotional stuff for now, you know? I feel back to being my cheerful self. I think some ice cream with my two best friends should help accomplish that. -Well, let's go then. Ice cream for the masses. -Wow. This is a crazy magazine. Let's see. How to practice gay safe sex. I guess that's good to know if I ever decided to do something like that. Huh? What's a rim job? Ew. Prior to eating out another guy's ass, it's best for the recipient of the analingus to first shower and thoroughly clean out his anus to ensure the removal of any dingleberries. What's a dingleberry? Dingleberries are tiny balls of fecal matter clinging to the hair surrounding the anus. Ew. That's it. Enough of this for one night. I'm going to bed. -Hello, Matthew. MATTHEW: Where am I? -In your future, Matthew. You're about to give a hot guy a rim job and you're staring into his butthole. MATTHEW: That's disgusting. I don't believe you. Who are you guys? -We're the dingleberries. MATTHEW: You mean-- -That's right, Matthew. We are tiny little balls of shit clinging to this hot guy's ass hair, and you're about to eat us. MATTHEW: Yuck. No way. -It's OK, Matthew. We don't mind. We like to be eaten. In fact, if you like, you can pour a little honey or chocolate syrup on this guy's asshole and add a little extra flavor to your meal. Add some whipped cream while you're at it. We go very well with the whipped cream. We're so tasty, Matthew. People just don't appreciate us as much as they ought to. I mean, you've heard of strawberry pie. You've heard of blueberry pie. You've heard of raspberry pie and blackberry pie. But what about dingleberry pie? When was the last time someone baked a nice, warm, dingleberry pie? People just don't know what they're missing, Matthew. MATTHEW: That is so gross. -Come on, Matthew. That isn't very nice. You have this hot guy here waiting for you to eat his ass out, and you're just staring at us calling us gross. We're not gross, Matthew. We're cute and friendly. Would you like to hear a song? MATTHEW: I don't know. Sure you would. Come on, boys. Hit it! [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. Eat us up, up, up. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. Yum, yum, yum. We really like you. Matthew, won't you please eat us up? I bet you we will pass through. and we'll be the dingleberries on your own butt. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. Eat us up, up, up. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. We are the dingleberries. Yum, yum, yum. -Come on, Matthew, open wide! MATTHEW: No way. I won't do it. -It's too late, Matthew. You can't control yourself anymore. You're gay, after all. And this is what gay people do. MATTHEW: But-- but I-- oh, no. I can't resist. I can't stop myself from doing it. -That's it. Matthew. Dig in. [SLURPING SOUND] -Yes, that's it, Matthew. Good boy. Keep thorough. Make sure you don't miss any of us. [SLURPING SOUND] MATTHEW: No! [SIGHS] It was just a dream. I didn't eat any dingleberries. Why does being gay have to be so gross? [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] -Yeah! These ones are big ones today. Take that, sinners! -Ooh, Satan's coming up. You beat him and you beat the game. -I love your excitement about it, Matt. God, you've beaten this game like what? Six times already? -Seven, but, uh, who's counting? I mean, there's only so many Christian video games. And I mean, it's always fun to pull one out that you've beat before, to see if you can do it faster next time. -I think most of the fun comes from being around you and watching you get all excited that you're about to kick Satan's butt for the eighth time. Take that! Oh, yeah. You're no match for the power of Christ! -Ooh, make sure that you kneel and pray each time before you zap him. It's time consuming, but you beat Satan faster in the end. Oh, and use your Bible as a shield. The further you get in the game, the more effective it becomes. -Whoever wrote this game really knows how to drive home the point. -Yeah, well, it's Pastor Steve's number one recommendation for a reason. -Oh, yeah. You're going down, Satan. Going down! The power of Christ is stronger than you, isn't it? Take that! [EXPLOSION NOISES] -Oh, sweet. You annihilated him. -It was all thanks to Jesus. -That's right. -That was fun. Hey, what's this? There's something sticking out from underneath your mattress. "Hot Cock 4-U?" -Brandon, it's not what you think. I mean, I can explain. It's just that I-- well, I'm sorry, Brandon. Please don't be mad at me. -Mad that you're gay, Matthew? -Oh, shit, Brandon, I wanted to talk to you for the longest time, but I just-- -Shh. -Holy shit. What's happening, Brandon? Am I dreaming? -I think I'm the one that's dreaming, Matthew. We've been friends for so many years, and so many of those years I've been in love with you. I wanted to say something sooner, but I was too scared. I was too scared to admit that I was in love with you. I was too scared to even admit to being gay. But I realize now you were about to tell me and Chuck yesterday in your kitchen. You were about to tell us you were gay, weren't you? -Yeah. But I was way too scared. -But you almost did. That's braver than anything I could have ever done, Matthew. I suspected it for so long. I thought it was just in my head. I thought it was just wishful thinking on my part. I thought I was just imagining that there was something growing between us. Was I imagining it, Matthew? -No. You weren't imagining it. I thought I was the one that was imagining it. So I forced myself not to think of you in that way. Are you sure I'm not dreaming, Brandon? -No. I'm pretty sure this is for real. VOICE FROM BEHIND: Matthew? -Dad! I thought you were at work. MATTHEW'S DAD: That's clearly obvious, Matthew. I was supposed to be, but it looks as though God willed for me to leave early today so that could come home to witness this and put an end to it. "Hot Cock 4-U?" Should I even ask you to explain yourself, Matthew? -Dad, I-- MATTHEW'S DAD: I-- I mean I walk into your bedroom, and here you are kissing Brandon? And there's a homosexual pornographic magazine laying in your bed? There are queers in this household, Matthew. Do you hear me? -Dad, I-- -Sir-- MATTHEW'S DAD: This is between Matthew and I, Brandon, just as this will be between you and your mom when you get home. -[SIGHS] MATTHEW'S DAD: In fact, you should go now. I'll be calling your mom later to discuss this matter, as if she doesn't have enough to deal with raising you and your brothers all by herself. I highly recommend that you tell her about this before I do so that at least the truth can come from your own lips. Now leave so Matthew and I can be alone. -Sir, this was all my fault. MATTHEW'S DAD: That's enough, Brandon. -[SIGH] MATTHEW'S DAD: It's nice of you to stick up for my son, but he needs to stand up for himself right now. (ANGRILY) Go now. -It's OK, Brandon. You should go. -[ANGRY SIGH] -Dad, I-- MATTHEW'S DAD: We will not have smut like this in our household, nor will we have queers. You're not one of them, Matthew, and neither is Brandon. You're both just confused. They've clearly gotten to the both of you. I know the homosexuals are out there trying to steal young people away and convert them to their sinful way of life, but I refuse to allow that to happen to my own son. This is a Christian household, Matthew. Do you understand me? My son is not going to be a queer. God does not approve of homosexuality, Matthew. There is no heaven for queers, Matthew. Do you understand me? There is no heaven for queers! -Dad! MATTHEW'S DAD: No, Matthew. There is nothing more for you to say right now. This filthy magazine says it all. I-- I never thought my own son would be looking at something so disgusting as this "Hot Cock 4-U" magazine. It sickens me to even say the name of this filthy, ungodly pornographic magazine. You're to stay in your room for the rest of the night, Matthew, and pray about this. I need to discuss this matter with your mom when she gets home so that she and I can figure out what to do about this. -But Dad-- MATTHEW'S DAD: There will be no further discussion at this moment, Matthew. But believe me, there will be later. Get-- get to praying, young man. Pray to God. Thank Jesus for forgiveness and pray for guidance. Pray good and hard that you don't turn into a discussing queer. -[CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -[SIGHS] BRANDON: That was an awesome [INAUDIBLE]. -Yeah, it was. -What about Lindsey? Did you have any idea she could swim like that? -No, she beat the both of us easily every time we raced her. Hey, where is everybody? -Uh, we're running a bit behind. It's almost dinnertime. I noticed the rest of the guys got out of the pool before us. They're probably at the cafeteria already. -Well, we better get going then, huh? -There's no hurry. We've still got a few minutes. And besides, there's always one or two people that get to dinner late. Nobody seems to care. -Well, in that case, there's something I wanna do. Actually, it's something I've wanted to do ever since we got here. -Wow. I missed those lips so much. I was too scared to say or do anything since we got here. I didn't want to get you in trouble. -I love you, Matthew. -I love you, too. -I have to tell you something. [SIGHS] I've been saved ever since I was 12 years old. And ever since then, I've tried to be a good Christian. You know, I really have. All this stuff they're trying to tell us here? You know, how we need to be transformed into heterosexuals and how we need to have a strong relationship with Jesus in order to accomplish that-- I don't believe that anymore. I feel very close with Jesus, Matt. And, you know, I did ever since I was saved. It's like He's with me all the time. [SIGHS] But I don't see a conflict between my Christianity and my homosexuality any longer. And I don't want to bear the struggle anymore. I just want to be myself. And I can be that with you. And I can be that with Jesus also. I just wouldn't let myself before. He doesn't hate me for being gay. You know, He never did. But I need to stop hating myself. And I know I'm going to hate myself if we take this any further. I just don't want this to be a summer fling between us. You mean too much to me. I want to continue to see you openly after camp is over, and I want to take you out on a real date. I want to spend some quality time with you. I want us to be a real couple. I want our first time to be beautiful and not a quickie because we had to sneak around. I don't want to sneak around, Matthew. I don't care how long it takes. You'll be 18 soon enough, and you'll be able to move out of your parents' house. Then they won't have control over you anymore. We'll plan things out. We'll take things slowly. And when we're ready, we'll get our own place together, someplace-- someplace where we don't have to hide anymore. I love you, Matthew. I love you, and I'm not ashamed. -I love you, too. I suppose we have to get dressed now, huh? -Disappointed? -No. Not as long as you meant everything that you just said. -I totally meant it. -All right, then. First one more kiss. Time for food? -Huh? Uh. Yeah, food. [MUSIC PLAYING] -No! Brandon! It was just a dream. Oh, calm down. It was just a dream. Oh, but it felt so real. I need to know that he's OK. I should call him. Oh, but it's probably too early to call. But his mom's probably already left for work, so it should be OK. Wait, that stupid. I don't know what time his mom gets up and goes to work. What if everyone's still sleeping and I call and wake them up? I'm gonna look so stupid. Oh, it was just a stupid dream. I just need to calm down. Everything's going to be OK. What if it's not? Something just feels so wrong. [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? BRANDON (ON PHONE): Matthew? -Yeah. Brandon, is that you? BRANDON (ON PHONE): Yeah. I didn't wake you, did I? -Don't worry about it. I-- I just had this terrible dream that something bad was happening to you. I just woke up from it. It scared me so much I was just gonna call you. Are you OK? BRANDON (ON PHONE): Sort of. You had a dream about me? -Yeah. BRANDON (ON PHONE): What happened in it? -It was pretty scary. I-- I dreamt that you were trying to kill yourself. BRANDON (ON PHONE): Wow. -Pretty crazy, huh? BRANDON (ON PHONE): Maybe not so crazy, Matthew. I nearly did it. -Nearly did what? BRANDON (ON PHONE): I nearly killed myself. I mean-- I was thinking about it. -Oh my God. Are you OK? BRANDON (ON PHONE): Yeah. I didn't actually do anything. I almost did, but I stopped myself. I'm sorry to lay all this on you, Matthew. -I'm just glad to know that you're OK. Promise me you won't hurt yourself, Brandon. BRANDON (ON PHONE): I promise. -What's going on? Why were you thinking of killing yourself? BRANDON (ON PHONE): When I got home from camp, things seemed kind of weird. My brothers weren't there. My mom told me they were spending the night at my grandparents'. She said she wanted to be able to talk to me without them overhearing. She asked me how camp was. I told her it was fine. [SIGHS] Of course, what she wanted to know was what sort of progress I'd made toward becoming straight, so she started asking me questions about that. At first, I tried to just play along and let her think I was cured. But for some reason I couldn't keep playing along. I didn't want to live like that anymore. So I just decided to be honest with her. I told you that even though camp tried pretty hard to get me to work on being straight, I've come to realize that I'm gay, and there's nothing that can change that. I told her I finally accept that's how it is but that I also no longer think of it as a bad thing. I told her I feel optimistic about my future. She asked if this had anything to do with you. But I told her that as far as I knew, camp worked for you. I didn't want to say anything to her that would get you in trouble with your parents. So I told her that this was only about me. I told her that I was gay, and that I wanted her to just accept me and to love me even if she didn't completely agree with the idea of having a gay son. Well, she wasn't pleased at all. Not with any of it. I told her that I wasn't trying to hurt her. I was just trying to be honest rather than to lie to her. She told me that she respected my honesty but that she was disgusted with what I had become, and she said she couldn't have someone like me living in the same house with her and my brothers any longer. She told me that she didn't want my siblings exposed to the kind of person that I have become. She told me that she was ashamed of me. Then she went on to say that this is the end of the line for her and her attempts to help me and that clearly I did not want to be helped. So there was no point any longer in her trying. She told me that as far as she was concerned, I was dead to her and dead to my brothers. She told me to get out of her home and said that she never wants to see me again. She then started to leave the house and told me that she was going to spend the night at my grandparents' house. She said that by the time she gets home the next day she expected me to be gone. She said that I should gather up whichever of my belongings I wanted to take with me and go somewhere far away from her where she will never see me again. I was crying so hard, begging for her not to do this, apologizing to her for causing her pain. But she just walked out the door and told me that I better not be there when she gets back. I couldn't believe what had happened. I felt like I wanted to end it all. Thoughts of killing myself started to flow through my head, and I started figuring out how to actually do it. I felt like I might actually kill myself. But I eventually started to get so tired from crying so much that I eventually passed out and fell asleep. But I just kept waking up, over and over, and every time I did, I felt more and more hopeless. And I just kept feeling more and more like I should just end it all. But then I started to see you in my dreams, calling out to me, telling me not to do it. And then I started to feel a sense of calm. I felt Jesus inside of me and all around me. I knew it was Him, because I had that same feeling before when I was saved, and I still sometimes get that feeling when things are peaceful. And I just clear my head and focus on Him and feel one with Him. And even though things weren't all that peaceful in my head at that moment, and my thoughts weren't so much on Jesus, there He was, reminding me that He was indeed with me. And He was reminding me that I didn't have it so bad, reminding me how blessed I truly was, and reminding me of how bad I wanted to take you out on that date and how much I was looking forward to being with you and eventually getting our own place together. He reminded me that these things that I was so looking forward to were no less in front of me now than they were before the incident with my mom. All I needed was the strength to pick myself up. And He helped me to find that strength inside of me. And He helped me to see all of the reasons that I had to be hopeful. Now it's up to me, Matthew. I know this is sudden, but I have no choice now. I have to move away. And I wanted to call you and tell you and I also wanted to invite you to come with me. Now, I totally understand if you need a little more notice. and if you want to wait awhile until I'm eventually settled somewhere before you join me. That's totally OK. But I have no choice except to go now, because I'm basically homeless as of this moment. It's totally up to you what you want to do. You don't-- you don't have to come with me. MATTHEW: [CRYING] BRANDON (ON PHONE): I don't-- I want to pressure you. I know how sudden this all is. So if you want to stay with your parents for now and then join up with me later, that's totally fine, no hard feelings. I still love you, and I still plan on taking you out on that date no matter what you decide right now. -I don't want to wait. I want to go with you now. BRANDON (ON PHONE): Are you sure? -Yes. Will you come get me? BRANDON (ON PHONE): I will so come get you. -[SNIFFS] All right. I'll be here. My parents should be out for a while, so I'll just pack whatever I need and-- and grab whatever money I can. BRANDON (ON PHONE): Yeah. I already grabbed whatever I had. I'm sure we'll be fine if we pool our money together. We'll catch a bus to someplace where your parents won't be able to find you, some place that's safe for us. I need to ask you one more time, though. Are you completely sure you want to do this? -[CRYING] Yes. Just come get me. I'll be waiting here for you. BRANDON (ON PHONE): OK. I'm on my way. I love you, Matthew. -[CRYING] I love you, too. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFLING] Jesus, thank you for being there for Brandon. And thank you for keeping us connected in our time of need. [SOBBING] Thank you for coming to Earth and dying for all my sins. I see you now. You're always there. [SOBBING] But now I see you. [SOBBING] Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to open myself so that you could be revealed to me. [SOBBING] I know that I'm a sinner, just like every other human being, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I make no justifications, no excuses for any of it. I know that you died on that cross for my sin. And then you rose from the dead. I confess that you are Lord. I accept you now as my Lord and savior. Please enter me and let your blood flow through my veins. Please stay with me always. Amen. [SOBBING] BRANDON: You sure you still want to come with me? It's not too late to change your mind, you know. -And so stop asking me that. I'm so totally 100% sure. In fact, there's something else I'm sure about. Come here. -Matthew, I don't want to rush you into any of this. -Who's rushing? This time around I'm certain my dad won't be walking through that door at any moment. I'm done waiting, Brandon. And besides, if we're gonna start our new life together, I think we can finally stop holding ourselves back from what's been building up between us all these years. Now lay down. -Ah, yes, sir. -It's gonna be OK, Matthew. -I know. But tonight feels like it's gonna be colder than last night. It sucks so much that we have to sleep out here again. But I'll deal. Maybe if I wasn't so hungry this wouldn't be so bad. I've never been this hungry before, Brandon. -I know what you mean. I'm sorry I put you through all this, Matthew. It's my fault that we're here. -It's not your fault. I want to be with you. I'd rather be here with you than anywhere else in the world. -I know. I just wish we were together someplace else. I wish being with me didn't mean sitting here, hungry and homeless. -Will you stop beating yourself up? We'll get through all of it. -Yeah. Well, in the meantime, I think I should try and find us some money, enough to buy us a bite to eat. Maybe I can even find us enough to rent us a room in that cheap hotel for the night. It's nasty there, but at least we'd have our own private room and shower. Want to shower with me, Matthew? -Heck yeah, I do. But how are you gonna get us the money? -I'm just gonna go into the bar, see what I can come up with. -How are you going to get money in there? The same guys that offer us money for blow jobs go in and out of there. -I know. -Look, I don't want you sucking some nasty pervert's dick just to get us money to feed me and give us a room to sleep in for a night. Who said anything about sucking dick? Don't worry, Matt. You know I wouldn't do that. Your dick is the only dick I'm interested in, sorry. And what a fine dick it is. -So how are you gonna get us money in there? -I'm just gonna see if I can find someone who looks nice. You know, maybe they can give me some money. Or maybe I can win some money playing pool or darts. I'm real good at that sort of stuff. -Should I come with you? -Nah. You stay here and guard our stuff. If anyone gives you trouble, don't be afraid to yell an run into the bar. There's plenty of people around, though, so you'll be safe. But just in case, you know what to do, OK? -OK. And you be careful, too. Promise me you won't do anything stupid. -Who, me? Don't worry. I'll be putting any nasty pervert's gross herpes- and gonorrhea-covered dick in my mouth. -And don't forget genital warts. -How could I forget genital warts after Counselor Dave's many lectures? Allow me to correct myself. I won't be putting any nasty pervert's gross herpes-, gonorrhea-, and genital-warts-covered, pus-dripping dick in my mouth. Oh, and how about this? Even if there's a guy in there with a dick as clean as my mother's kitchen table after she's disinfected the hell out of it and he offers me $1,000 to suck his super clean dick, I still won't do it. Even if he offers me $100 just to touch it once with my pinky, I won't do it. It's just you and me, Matthew. There's no other guys for me, not even for money. I promise. It's just you and me forever. I love you, Matthew. -I love you, too. NEARBY MAN'S VOICE: Oh, how sweet, the two of you are so adorable. You're like cute little gay kittens. -Um, hi. NEARBY MAN'S VOICE: Sorry, boys. I wasn't exactly going out of my way to eavesdrop. I was just grabbing a smoke outside and couldn't help but overhear. But since I'm already out here, mind if I grab a seat with the both of you? Maybe I can help you boys out. Is there room on this cardboard for me? -Yeah, I guess so. -Sure. Why not? -I prefer to get my rear on a nice comfortable chair. Oh, this dirty piece of cardboard. Not to say my rear doesn't get around. But you boys don't need to know that. -Um-- -Oh, I'm just being silly. Hi, I'm Tommy. -I'm Brandon. -Oh, Such a nice, firm handshake. -I'm Matthew. -Oh, what young, delicate hands. Oh, I feel like a dirty old man just touching them. Oh, you know, a lot of the boys in there are talking about you two. You can definitely make some money if you go in there. But it will be playing pool or darts. Betting on games is against bar rules. And besides, the men in there have things on their mind besides pool when it comes to the two of you. The kind of stick they want to handle when it comes to you boys isn't a pool stick, if you know what I mean. So if you go in there by yourselves with money on your mind, be prepared for exactly the kind of business transaction you don't want. -So what are we supposed to do, Tommy? -Well, let me ask you first, how did the two of you end up here? I mean, I asked the bartender about you. He's a friend of mine and doesn't spread false gossip. He said that as far as he knows, you're not into drugs. And you're obviously not hustlers, so what gives? -Is it OK if I tell him? -Yeah, I guess so. The no talking to strangers rule doesn't apply anymore. Everyone here is a stranger. -I'm not so strange. I'm just your run-of-the-mill queenie homo. -Well, we come from very Christian families. I got kicked out of my house for being gay. And Matthew's my boyfriend. We hopped on a bus and took it far, far away from home so that his parents wouldn't find him and couldn't touch him. [SIGH] His parents had put him in a mental institution for being gay before. And we didn't want them doing it again. He's still only 17, so they can pretty much do whatever they want with him. TOMMY: It never changes, does it? After all the progress we've made, there are still nice young boys going through the exact same thing today as when I was your age. And believe me, that was a very long time ago. -You don't seem that old, Tommy. -Oh, flattery will get you everywhere, Matthew. So what about you, Brandon? Are you also 17? -Nope. I'm 18. -Have you tried to get any social services? -We got here a few days ago. I stopped by the county office as they were closing today, and they said it was too late in the day, and they told me to come back on Monday. Besides, I'd rather just work. -I wanna work, too. -Yeah. -That's just how we were raised. Except we talked about it, and we decided that it would be best if we waited until Matthew turned 18 before he got a job so that his name doesn't suddenly pop up on the radar. His parents are probably still looking for him. He left them a note saying not to worry and not to look for him, but I doubt they'll listen. -Would they suspect the two of you are together right now? -Yeah. Probably. -If that's the case, and they're looking for him, it's just as easy for a private investigator or police to spot your name when it pops up on the radar. -Yeah. I know. But he's gonna turn 18 in just a few weeks. And if anybody starts bothering me, we'll just stall them until after he turns 18. TOMMY: And if the two of you just lay low for now, then when Matthew turns 18, you won't have to worry at all about any of that. -Yeah, I guess. But that means being homeless. TOMMY: Maybe not. Listen, boys. I'm a pretty good judge of character. I have a pretty big house and can probably offer you a place to stay for now until you get on your feet. It's no strings attached sort of thing. I don't expect anything back from either of you except that you behave as good guests. There's a late night cafe near here. Why don't we walk over there and I'll buy you boys something to eat. We can talk about it some more, and once we're there, get to know each other a little bit better, figure out if it's a good idea. I'm a pretty good judge of character and don't think I have to worry about you boys stealing from me or taking advantage of me. -You're right about that, Tommy. -Good. Then let's get going then. -I don't know. I-- I mean, it's one thing to talk to a stranger. It's another thing to go home with one, even if you do seem really nice. TOMMY: I understand, Matthew, and you're right. But I only want to help. You're very wise to be cautious. But I promise you that you will be far safer in my home than you are right now out here on the streets. Besides, you boys aren't the only ones who come from a very Christian family. [CLEARS THROAT] "And above all things, have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. Use hospitality one to another without grudging." -Wow, Tommy. Straight out of the Book of Peter. I'm impressed. -Thank you, Brandon. -OK, that was impressive. -Come on. Let's give it a chance. We can at least go to the cafe and talk about it some more. It can't hurt to talk about it some more. -OK, I guess you're right. But if we do decide to go home with you, will you promise that you're really just trying to help us and you won't hurt either of us and you won't turn into a perv and try to molest us? I mean, I know that's a stupid question. Because if you were trying to trick us, you wouldn't tell us that you were trying to trick us. But I would feel a lot better if you'd look me in the eye and promise me anyway. -I promise, Matthew. -All right them. If you're for real, Tommy, then thank you. Thank you so much. -And this, boys, is the guest bedroom. Just throw your stuff on the floor. You can put it in the dresser and the closet later. There's plenty of room. -This is great, Tommy. TOMMY: You like it? -Oh, totally. It's nice in here just like the rest of your house. -So it's safe to say that you gentlemen will be staying the night and maybe a little longer? -It's a nice bedroom and a nice house and nice, safe neighborhood. I'm so ready to crawl into bed and not have to sleep in that alley again. Thanks so much, Tommy. And thank you again for the food. It was really good. -You're totally welcome. -Yeah, thanks again for the food, Tommy. That was the best sandwich I ever had my whole life. -Thank you, Matthew, but I think your extreme hunger may be influencing your rave review of that sandwich. -Well, yeah, maybe. But maybe not. It was all gourmet and stuff. -Well, I'm glad you liked it. I'm gonna give you boys some privacy right now. The guest bathroom is right outside. There are fresh towels in case the two of you want to shower before you go to bed. Feel free to use the hot water. I won't need it until tomorrow morning. Also, there are new toothbrushes in there. And you boys are welcome to use them. You boys have a good night. -Good night to you, too, Tommy. -Yeah, Tommy, you have a good night. -Good night, boys. [MUSIC PLAYING] -So do you like it here so far? -Yeah, I do. -Well, good. You wanna take a shower with me? -Heck yeah. -You know, aside from that camp, we never showered together. And I don't know if camp really counts. -Yeah, not really. There'd be other guys in there. And I was real nervous because I was secretly checking you out the whole time. It's only because I was so nervous that I didn't get a hard-on. -Yeah, you wouldn't want to have to explain a hard-on to the counselors. Besides, Matthew, Jesus only wants you have a hard-on for your future wife. You'd be in trouble if you had a hard-on in the boys' shower. -I'd just tell them it was all your fault. -Oh, would you? -Yeah, your fault for being so damn hot. --[LAUGHS] Well, I used to check you out, too. I just learned to run the water cold on my cock if it started to grow. -Ooh, you're clever. Well, it doesn't matter now. Because now we can have all the boners we want. -What are we gonna do with all them boners? -I could think of stuff. So do you want to shower with me and run the water nice and warm for a change? -Dude, I've never been so excited about a shower. I'm washing you all over real good. -Same here. I'm especially gonna focus on that cock of yours. That things is so huge. I hope there's enough soap and water. -Yeah, right. -It's humongous. [MUSIC PLAYING] -It was nice sleeping in, wasn't it? -Yeah, it was. I don't even remember Tommy leaving this morning. -Yeah, he just sort of gently knocked on the bedroom door and popped his head in. He said he had to go to the salon. -Did he say when he'd be back? -Nope. -Sorry I was so tired after the shower last night. -You so don't have to be apologizing for being tired after all you've been through. But you're not tired now, though, are you? -No. -Good. Cause, uh, I have plans for you. -Oh yeah, what sort of plans? -Well, it's been a stressful time for the both of us. It would be nice to unwind a bit. I know I sure could go for a nice, relaxing blow job. -Oh, aren't you the romantic one? Well, I meant romantic blow job. I thought that went without saying. -Oh, of course. -So very romantic being here with my wonderful, handsome boyfriend and being intimate with him. Oh, kissing your sweet lips, feeling your warm mouth pressed against mine, getting aroused by even your slightest touch, so aroused by my boyfriend, longing for those nice, soft lips of his to be wrapped around my big, hard cock. [PHONE RINGING] BRANDON: Shit. MATTHEW: Should we pick up? [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah, Tommy said he might call to check in on us. That could be him right now. [PHONE RINGING] -I'll be right back. [PHONE RINGING] BRANDON: Hello? Oh, hi, Tommy. Yeah, everything's fine. Are you sure? You don't have to do that. OK, thanks, Tommy. We'll be ready. Well, that was Tommy. -Yeah, that's what it sounded like. What's up? -He said he's done with his clients for the day and he's having his employees close up later so that he can leave early. He said he wants to take us out to lunch and give us a tour of the city. He'll be here in a few minutes. -That's so nice of him. He doesn't have to do that. -I know. That's what I said. But it would probably be a good idea to have a tour of the city. It would be nice to know our way around. But I guess there's no time for that blow job now. -Aw, I guess I'll just have to owe you. -Good. Because I'm so gonna collect that debt. -Oh, you don't have to worry. That's one debt I'm looking forward to paying. Maybe I'll even earn some interest in the meantime. -I don't exactly know what that means, Matt, but I do can't wait to find out. -Today was a fun day, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. It looks like Tommy's gonna be OK with us sticking around for at least a few weeks. -Yeah, Tommy's so nice. We're so lucky to have met him. -Totally. It looks like we're going to be sleeping in tomorrow. It's not like we belong to a church around here. -Yeah, but maybe we could find one eventually. I mean, I've heard of some churches that are actually OK with gay people. -Wow. That sounds like a nice change of pace. -Yeah. But sleeping in on Sundays doesn't sound too bad. -Yeah. I'm still a little worn out from all that we've been through. By the way, I have to tell you something. You sometimes toss and turn and even talk in your sleep. -Oh gosh. I'm sorry. I hope it doesn't bother you. -Oh, no. It's cool. I just have these crazy dreams. -Like what? -Well, most of them I don't even remember. But the ones I do, I usually prefer not to. -Nightmares? -Nah, they're just really weird and bizarre. -Oh yeah? Tell me one. -Are you sure? My dreams get pretty weird. -Yes. Tell me one of your dreams. -All right. Well, you remember that, uh, "Hot Cock 4-U" magazine that I had? -How could I forget? -Well, there was a safe sex article in it. And it talked about dingleberries. -Oh, no. -Yeah. And I fell asleep after reading it. And I had this dream that I was staring into this guy's ass, and there were dingleberries. But they were like these little cartoon characters that were talking to me and singing and trying to convince me to eat them up. -Ew! -Yeah, I know. But then I woke up. -Ah, thank goodness. -You're telling me. -Well I promise if you ever decide to give me a rim job, I will take a shower first. -You are so not getting a rim job. --[LAUGHS] I could live without it, I guess. -Well, you do get lots of other stuff. Oh yeah, like what? -Like that blow job I owe you from earlier. -Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. -No, you didn't. -You're right. I didn't. [LAUGHING] -I believe these are yours. [MOANING] [MOANING] MATTHEW: That's great. -Thank you. -It's sort of fun having a pool table. It's not as boring waiting around until I turn 18. I mean, I know we do chores and stuff, but that doesn't take much time. -There is actually something I want to talk to you about, Matt. -So important you can't talk while taking your next shot? -It kind of is, actually. -Well what is it, Brandon? -Well, remember the other night when we met Tommy's boyfriend? -Yeah. -Well, while you and Tommy were preparing food and wouldn't let us into the kitchen, he and I were talking. -And? -And he told me that he and Tommy are good friends with the owners of this gay club around here. Tommy just probably hadn't though about it, but apparently they're always looking for helpers. And he said that he's pretty sure they'd hire me and pay me off the books for a few weeks until you turned 18. -Wow, that's great. I mean, I know how much you really want to work and start making us some money. Uh, but a gay club? -Yeah. I know. -Well, what would you be doing there? I mean, what sort of helpers do they need? You don't know how to bar tend. And we don't believe in drinking alcohol. So what would you be doing in a place that serves alcohol to horny gay men? -It could be different stuff, like helping clean up the bar, helping wash the bar glasses, or working the front door or working the coat check or carrying around a tray of shots and trying to sell them to the customers. But most of the money would probably come from dancing. MATTHEW: Dancing? I don't understand. -I'd be a go-go boy, Matt. -A go-go boy. I'm not overly familiar with this, so correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a go-go boy sort of like a go-go girl, someone that dances around wearing practically nothing up on a platform or in a cage and has money shoved down their waistband by nasty perverts? -Yeah, something like that. -What the fuck, Brandon? Jeez, I can't believe I just said that. -I don't think I've ever heard you curse like that in your whole life, Matt. -I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't talk to you like that. -Well, I guess I deserved it laying all this on you. MATTHEW: No. No, you don't. I'm just confused, that's all. I understand that you want to make money, but why not wait until I turn 18 so we can get regular jobs? -Because. Thanks to me, the boy that I love more than anything in the world, the boy that I want to spend the rest of my life with, ended up homeless, sleeping on cardboard in a dirty alley way. I don't think I can ever forgive myself for that, Matt. You know, if I'd only learned to shut my mouth, none of this would have happened. We could have secretly made plans and done it the right way if I'd only lied to my mom when she asked me about being gay. But thanks for my pressing need to be honest, look what happened. -Yeah, but at least we have a roof over out heads for now. -Yeah, but as things stand, we don't have any money. We're relying entirely on Tommy's hospitality. I mean, what if he gets tired of having us around before we have enough money to get our own place? We'd be homeless again. I refuse to let that happen, Matt. I need to start getting some money, and I need to start getting some money now. I'm gonna take care of us, Matthew. You mean more to me than anything. But since I can't find another job, I guess I'll just have to be a go-go boy if that's what it takes to keep my boyfriend safe. -That's-- that's so-- -Yeah, so stupid, I know. -I was going to say beautiful. -Beautiful? -Yeah, beautiful. I have the best boyfriend ever. -No. I have the best boyfriend ever. So you're gonna be OK with me doing this? -As long as you promise to be very careful. I know they were just trying to scare us at Camp Get the Gay Out, Brandon, but not everything was scare tactics. A lot of it was the counselors' personal experiences. Do you remember when Counselor Dave gave us that talk about that one gay cowboy movie? -Yeah. -Well, he said that the gay relationships he'd seen weren't like the movie. The gay relationships he'd seen didn't last for years, that most of them were just a brief, random sexual encounter that lasted only a few minutes. And that if they did happen to last more than a few weeks, they'd quickly fall apart a few months later when one of the guys would tire of monogamy and start to stray. He said that to a gay man, a boyfriend is just as disposable as any cheap toy we have these days. He said that the gay lifestyle promoted promiscuity over stability because it favored superficiality and self-gratification rather than love and spirituality. He cried when he told us how he was once in love with a man and how they would constantly cheat on each other. He was so broken down and bitter when he said that a gay man would rather a new, exciting sexual encounter rather than anything else in life. I felt so sad for him. -I think you're putting things a little too nicely, Matt. I believe the exact words ex-gay Counselor Dave used were, "Gay guys don't know a darn thing about God and love. All they care about is dick. And to them, strangers' dicks taste best. The stranger the better." MATTHEW: Well, I just don't want that to be us. -Well, it's not. And it won't be. I promise. The thought of being with anyone else but you repulses me, Matt. I could never get sick of you. We've been-- we've known each other almost our whole lives now. And we've been friends through the whole thing. And now we're just more than that. You are not disposable to me. I don't ever want to live without you. I love you. And all the strangers' dicks in the world could never make me think otherwise. I look forward to a lifetime together, a lifetime of sharing and caring, a lifetime of making love, a lifetime of bending you over pool tables and having my way with you. --[LAUGHS] I didn't see that one coming. -Well, maybe you should have. Now, turn around and bend over. -[MOANS IN SLEEP] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) This is pure torture. The sweet boy I love has gone. Love and peace, nothing to him when presented with a stranger's cum. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best, at least tastier than mine. The pure love in this cruel world should not be easily dismissed. But loving becomes irrelevant compared to the sweet flavor of piss. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well I guess strangers' dicks taste best, at least tastier than mine. You say you're still just a kid. Yeah, what a guy commitment [INAUDIBLE] but I could be. But instead he went up on your knees sucking crusty cock, swallowing STDs. Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Well, I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well, I guess strangers' dicks taste best. Well, I guess strangers' dicks taste best, at least tastier than mine. -[MOANING IN SLEEP] -Shh. Shh. It's OK, Matthew. It's just a dream. -No stranger's dick. -Oh, Jeez, Matt. No strangers' dicks. It's just you and me, sweetie. You're just having a bad dream. Get some sleep and have happy dreams, happy dreams for Matthew. -Mm. Happy. [MUSIC PLAYING] TOMMY: Good night, Matthew. -Good night, Tommy. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CHIME RINGING] [DOOR CLOSING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CHIME RINGING] [DOOR CLOSING] -Hey, you. BRANDON: Hey. -How was school? BRANDON: Good. I did really well on that one test that I took the other day. if I'm doing as well when I finally start the regular fall semester as I'm doing with these two intro summer classes, college should be a breeze for me. -Wow. that's really great. -And how was your day? -Hectic, as usual. But I kinda like hectic days. I had this new client today who gave me a really huge tip. She said I made her look nicer that she ever looked in her whole life. But I think the tip was as much for the conversations as for the haircut. Tommy said that being a great hairdresser is much more than giving a good haircut. You have to sort of chat up the client and make them feel comfortable or else you won't be getting a very good tip. -Well, you're very fun to talk to you. I'm sure you'll be getting plenty more big tips in the future. I'm glad you're enjoying being a stylist. -Yeah. being a shampoo boy and an apprentice was fun, but now that I have my license, it's so much better. I really love being a stylist in Tommy's salon. -Yeah. I kinda miss you being a shampoo boy, though. It was fun having you practice shampooing my hair. -Aw, well do you want a quick shampoo before we go back to our apartment? -Yeah. I kind of would, actually. -All right. Let's get you over to that shampoo station then. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANS] MATTHEW: How does that feel? -Ah! Oh, wonderful. MATTHEW: [LAUGHS] I should shampoo you more often. That moan sounded almost like the noises you make during sex. BRANDON: [LAUGHS] Should I work on expanding my repertoire of sexual noises? MATTHEW: No, your repertoire is just fine with me. I like your cute noises. [LAUGHS] BRANDON: Ah. MATTHEW: Let's get you over to the salon chair so I can blow dry and style your hair for you. -[LAUGHS] Hm. you know what? I think I just want to comb it out and let it air dry. I'm gonna wind up ruining the style anyway when I take my nap later before work. So I'll wait until then before I style it. MATTHEW: Oh, you go-go boys and your perfect hair. --[LAUGHS] Yeah, well, even when I bar tend it helps to have good hair. The cuter you are, the more tips you get. That places is as superficial as they come. But it pays the bills and the owners are great. They love the fact that I'm not into drugs and don't get involved with any of the gay drama. They said that-- they said that they wish all their employees were like me. --[LAUGHS] Well, I'll be glad when you get your college degree and you can quit there and start doing the kid of work you really want to do. -Yeah. me, too. But it's still going to be a few years. -Yeah, I know. I'm totally cool with that. Any worries I had in the beginning about you working at a gay club are totally gone. You're still the same Brandon I know and love. -Yeah, well, I think we've both matured a lot this past year but at the same time stayed true to who we are. -Hey, who are you calling mature? [BOTH LAUGH] So you wanna get out of here and get home? -Uh, hold on a moment. There's actually something that I want to talk to you about. And I don't want to wait until we get home. -What's up? -You haven't heard the news yet, have you? -News? What news? -I think we should switch places first before I tell you. I want you to be sitting for this. -Something bad? -No, not bad, just big. -OK. So what's this big news already? -It's about the discrimination court case that's been in the new so much lately. They just had their ruling late this afternoon. The state Supreme Court just ruled that denying gay couples the right to marry is against the state constitution. Gay marriage just became legal here. -Oh my goodness. That's great news, Brandon. -I think so. I actually think it's amazing news, Matthew, because I've been holding on to something for close to a year now, and I finally have the chance to give it to you. -What what is it. Brandon? I'm confused. -After you turned 18 about a year back and we no longer had to keep our whereabouts a secret anymore, do you remember how Chuck was when he finally heard from us again? And he didn't judge us, and he didn't give us any grief. He just said that we better be there at his and Stacy's wedding and that we better follow through and be his best men. -Yeah, Chuck's awesome like that. -Yeah, he is. It was already weird enough that he had two best men at as wedding, but on top of that, his best men were a gay couple and everybody at the church knew thanks to the church rumor mill. Despite that, he and Stacy made sure that we felt welcome. After being rejected by my mother and my church, being accepted by Chuck was one of the most heartwarming things that I've ever felt in my life. Chuck, the All-American heterosexual Christian, Chuck, the youth group leader, Chuck, the future reverend accepted us with an open heart and open arms and showed us the same amount of love and friendship that he's always shown us as though nothing had ever changed. -Yeah, he totally did. -And he did even more than that. He pulled me aside at the wedding and he gave me something to give to you when the time was right. He said he understood that what you and I had is exactly equal to what he and Stacy had and that despite what the church said right now and despite what the government said right now, he truly believed that one day soon, we would have the opportunity to express our commitment and our devotion for each other the same way that he and Stacy were able to. He said that it was unfair for us to be denied that right. And he just told me to hang in there and to stay true to my faith and to stay true to my principles, and even if society didn't come around in our lifetimes, that we could still be a committed Christian couple without their official sanction. He said that if we stay true to our ideals and true to each other, that our union, whether recognized as marriage or not, could still mean so much more than so very many empty marriages that exist in society today. But in anticipation that his optimistic prediction of marriage equality actually came true soon, he wanted me to be prepared. So he gave me this ring. Ever since then, I've been waiting for the right moment to put this on you and to ask you to be my husband. I love you so much, Matthew. Would you please do me the honor of marrying me? -Of course I'll marry you, Brandon. I will so marry you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
