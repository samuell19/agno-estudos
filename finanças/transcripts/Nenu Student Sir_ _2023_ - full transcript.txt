It may be just coincidence No sir, your daughter seemed to be with the suspect and got to know they both move very close in the college is your daughter anyways connected in this case? listen Mr. Rahul, it's a just normal thing they both study in the same college they might know each other in a casual way doesn't mean everyone he knows are involved in this case exactly the same with my daughter, she isn't involved Sir, last question yes You loosing your gun, Nayak's death, you finding the gun back again, doesn't it seem like a cooked story, Sir? You guys are far better writers when it comes to stories You can create your own stories.. bye You are not able to catch a single student Sir? what's your next plan? Home Minister is calling me you know how he talks!! and one more important thing news about your daughter's involvement in this case is being highlighted in the news and media there's nothing as such sir.. remember one thing! our careers started with Ranks, it must not end with a remark, go find him now Yes sir.. [Phone rings] exactly the way you don't know what to ask the same way, I don't know what to say that's because.. Just like you, I am filled only with questions But I also know, who has the answers had your food? no.. wait, I am coming let's have together Dad? I am the one who gave Subbu your gun. but not the service revolver that was used to kill Nayak I gave him your personal revolver. Is this the gun, you gave? The gun he was holding in the morning is on our table by afternoon that's what has proven that he is innocent. may be because, I gave him your gun he is going through all the problems today. Since childhood, I grew up looking you in your uniform dad I am not capable of lying looking into your eyes that doesn't mean your Sruthi Vasudevan isn't a coward to hide the truth One thing I could say my relationship with a guy, will never be a problem to my dad, is what I hope! I don't think that might be the reason you're doing all this Sruthi.. Yes? The 2nd strong evidence I found in this case I am not giving it to the press just like you trust him if he trusts you the same way, ask him to come and surrender if he is really an innocent, I will get him out of this case My problem is not your relationship with him I don't want you to face any problem due to this relationship here, take it On Nayak's murder and on Police behavior [on TV] students unions are furious about it [on TV] RTC bus destroyed in the destruction caused [on TV] Police failure in controlling them [on TV] PA: Sir, here is your tablet pressure increased on Government [on TV] HM: why do I have to take that tablet now?

Go Sruthi About the thing we love the most, if we are not able to tell it to the person we love the most there is no other horrible hurt, pain than that the other day, reason I asked you the gun is not for fun it's for my phone I know Sruthi, the word "mobiles phone" irritates you but I am obsessed with my mobile phone with that obsession I played this stupid game using gun to get my phone I am really sorry Sruthi but, except asking you the gun, I haven't committed any mistake Trust me Sruthi I love you Subbu, I will never believe that you made a mistake to say that, except this I have no more words Sir, he is here DGP : many people are hospitalized because of him DGP : just now Home Minister clearly explained that DGP : at any cost this issue must be closed immediately DGP : He is just a middle class guy DGP : no one cares about his birth or the reason for his death.
