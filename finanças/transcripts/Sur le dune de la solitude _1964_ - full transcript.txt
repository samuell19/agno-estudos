On the dune of solitude Solitude by choice or despair? Please go on your way. I didn't mean to offend you, I'm sorry. Oh! It's you! You're not mad anymore? It's forgotten. Let's make peace. What's your name? Ndié. It's funny! And what is your name? Elia. That's not even funny. Sometimes... the waves remind me of mermaids chasing one another. Oh! It's so lukewarm! It must be so good to bath. Come with me, there's a great spot on the other side. You frightened me earlier, you know. For a second, I thought I was in front of the Daughter of Waters. What a foolish thought! When we were kids, we heard many stories about the Daughter of Waters. Now, we sometimes feel like we live in that legend. Do you know the story? Of course! But there are different versions. I don't know if we've heard the same. There was a mermaid, roaming beaches, banks and waterways. She was looking for a lover. She was fond of music. She would only take humans for lovers. She had a soft spot for loners, especially the ones wandering at night. When she has chosen one, she lavishes him with the treasure she had hidden underwater. If she can be incredibly generous, at times, she can also be... very cruel. She is jealous. So as to check on her lovers' fidelity, she puts them to the test for some time. During that probation period, she goes and tempts them hiding behind different bodies of diverse beauties. If the lover is charmed, he deserves a punishment. Pitilessly. She would kill him by stabbing his heart. On the other hand, if he remains faithful, he will live the rest of his life like a king. The mermaid will protect him against every misfortune that may threaten him. No! No! I fairly often come here to look for isolation. But, in the depth of my solitude, the face of a woman always arises to enlighten my thoughts. It feels so unreal that, today, this dream comes true. So you were to one haunting my thoughts. Certainly not. I don't believe in legends, Sir. Are you sure? What are you doing here alone, then? You exposed me! I'm the Daughter of Waters. Daughter of Waters, have you chosen me as your lover? I would have to test you. And I would have you suffer the ultimate punishment. Because you will inevitably fall into the trap. That's the death I've been dreaming of! To be stabbed by the one I love... Oh, Elia! How are you doing? I've knocked on your door but you were absent. You were away this morning. Have you heard the misfortune that has hit our friend Denis? - Denis? - Yes. The young man who often visit me and who you find so nice. Well, his sister died in a water accident. - He had a sister? - Oh! If you had seen her... An real angel. She came here with her brother once. I'm surprised you had not noticed her. What happened? Yesterday, Saturday night, she went out with some friends to go to a party. But their car got out of control in a curve. They were crammed in like sardines. Her friends got off with scratches and concussions. But her... She died. What a story! People say she didn't have a scratch on her body. She died before she could be taken to the hospital. Cigarette? Denis brought me the sad news. He was really down. The funerals are at 4pm. Before you go, come and call me. I don't know where they live but I'd like to offer my condolences. What a misfortune! It's awful. See you later then. I'm at a loss with all the customs. Who do I give the money to? And when? I'd rather you take care of it. Take the money and offer it when to moment comes. I'll give yours and mine at the same time, it will be simpler. It's nice of you to come. That's the least we can do. Condolences. - Condolences, Denis. - Thanks. Let me introduce you to the family. Elia and me empathize with the great suffering that has struck you today. Give this modest sum to your mother. Thank you. Mom, my friends are offering their condolences. Come near the corpse. - What's gotten into him? - I don't know. I spent the night here with her! The whole night, do you hear me? The one time I meet a girl, she is from another world! What a nightmare! Ndié! Ndié! Yes, that was my sister's name. Let's go. Let's not stay here. Let's go away. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Proofreading: flipflink
