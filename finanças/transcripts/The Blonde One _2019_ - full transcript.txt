Why did you empty that room? For one guy from my work. You're letting him crash there? No, I'm renting it to him. Your brother lived in it, right? Yeah. - He's going to be a father. - Mariano? That's great! He's still young. 23? No, I'm four years older than him. He's 26. He knocked up his girlfriend. But no worries. He has a job and all. Hey guys. - Who's staying? - Staying where? In that room. Gabriel, dude. Which Gabriel? You saw him a couple of times. The blond one. THE BLOND ONE Gabo. Here are the keys. I'm going out for a while. Okay. See you tomorrow, Dummy. If he bothers you, let me know. Sure. He's on his own. Come on... In USA and Sweden they call football soccer. It's a women's sport. In China too... And the women playing are gorgeous. Totally hot. You should see how they play, they move the ball around nicely. They work closely with laboratories. Special drugs make their legs stronger and so on. They are as powerful as men but in female bodies. And it's not by some muscle surgery or something. They're still fully female. Show us the picture. Where are they from? Sweden? Look at her tight shirt. It's like she's wearing a bikini. You're not focusing on the most important thing, man. I'm serious. We ignore it and they're getting better than us. You'll see. They'll end up winning the World Cup. - Just look at her. - Oh, piss off. Cool down, Mario. Mario's quite a character, right? Yeah. I'm going to bed. Okay. Brian aims at you, shoots and you end up all marked. I remember my first time there. I'd forgotten my gloves. You end up bruised and with paint marks looking like blood. It's awful. The game is great though. But because you use compressed air rifles, if you don't wear protection you can get hurt. Well, a bit. It's fun. We should go sometime. I'm going to bed. Tomorrow I start early. Okay. Good night. Leave the door open or he'll sleep till afternoon. Okay. Where are you going today? To Berisso. Oh, that's far away. Your mother still lives there, right? Your daughter too? Does she go to school there? The train is in ten minutes. You're coming too? Yeah. Leave us a little. Good yerba. - Do you like it where you live? - Yes. Is it a nice place? Are you eating well? Yeah, mom. Do you have a heater? Cold weather is coming. - Dad, are you coming to my room? - Yes, I'm coming. - Come on! - I'll be right there, honey. Oh, the money. Here. I'll buy her a jacket. Go. I'm here, Juan. What's up? I was just sitting here. Your friend came out of the room, but she didn't see me. I didn't know what to say. It's okay, man. Don't worry. Have you eaten? No. Let's grab something. I wanted tattoos on both arms. A bunny on this side... and a fox here, hidden in bushes. Black ink only. Like the yin-yang. My brother uses Photoshop. He shows me how they'll look on me. But I'm afraid I'll regret it. I have a picture here. You'd look nice with tattoos... on that pale skin. Look, here it is. - Do you like it? - Yeah, nice. They forgot about the cheese. - Did I tell you about my new job? - No. I quit the old one. You know? Yeah? Now I'm working in a pharmacy near the station. Yeah, I know which one. I like it so far. I'm going to save up for a few months. To move out from my aunt's place and live on my own. Are you fed up with her? Yeah. - You okay? - Yes. You? We were seeing each other for a while. But we didn't get along so we broke up. She always does the same thing. She pops up and ends up staying. I think she has a boyfriend now. But she keeps coming back to me. Are you seeing someone? Sort of. What's their name? Julia. I didn't know you were upstairs. What's up? All good? Yeah, I'm just tired. Have some beer. Are you coming back on Sunday? Yes. So you see her once a month. No, when I came here she went to Cordoba with my mother. Only till Monday when school starts. Is she in second grade? It's Leandro. The cat was under the stairs with her kittens in a shoebox. I found it weird because they weren't in a basket or didn't have a blanket. So I asked grandma and she told me that the cat wanted to hide them. Because before that she also had had kittens in a box. Grandma put them in a basket. But the cat took them out one by one and hid the kittens somewhere. She doesn't want us to find them. Sure. Since I am a child and she knows I'm not going to hurt them she let me hold them and closed her eyes. - How? - Like this. And she started making this sound. What is it called? The sound cats make? Purring. Yes, I forgot the word. She purred. I wanted to take one kitten but grandma didn't let me. She said it wouldn't get along with Perla, because she's old. Yeah, probably. Hey, I'm going to buy cigarettes. Do you want something? No, thanks. The street is in chaos. What are you reading? "The Illustrated Man" Who wrote it? Ray Bradbury. Thanks. I'm telling you. The street is in chaos. Two motorcycles crashed. A guy was lying there. Total mess. I'm going for a smoke. Wanna go grab a beer? Okay. Hurry up. They're closing soon. Okay. Shall we go for a beer? Okay. Do you collect bunnies? Yes. Hello. Hey, we are having pizza. Do you want to join us? Okay. The train is in ten minutes. You see, I don't need marriage or children. And this guy wanted that. We've been dating for two months when I brought it up. He didn't like it at all. I think he wanted to get married. I told him: "If you want to be with another women, I don't care." Why should I? He took it really bad and stopped calling me. Idiot. Two months later he called. I told him to forget it. Seriously. Get lost, man. The guy was crazy. I mean, relax. I'll go to the bathroom before I leave. Was it you who fixed the bath tap? Yes. So you know stuff like that? Yeah, my father taught me. When I was a kid. So, catch you later. Bye. Daddy? My teacher asked me why I live with my grandma instead of my mom and dad. So I told her my mum died when I was little. And that you have to work far away and that grandpa is building a room upstairs so you can live with us because you can't afford the rent. Why did she ask you that? Because I told her that grandma helps me with the homework. But sometimes she doesn't understand. And that's why she asked. Daddy, I want to go to the movies. Because the last time I went to cinema with grandma, they were announcing the upcoming movies. There was one I really wanted to see but grandma and me don't remember the title. What was it about? Do you remember? Hey, that man at work today was crazy, right? I thought the truck driver was going to kill him. I did too. He was crazy. Throwing the stuff on the ground like that... Wanna come with me to buy some ice cream? Okay, let's go. I'm going to bed. Shitty speakers... I'll get the headphones. Listen. - Hi, how are things? - Fine. Thank you for letting me in and sorry to drop by so late. I had an argument with Gime. It's a mess. She read something on my Facebook and got mad. What were you doing? Hi, Dummy. Hey, Mario. How are you? She kicked me out. I was just telling him. And I didn't even fuck the girl. I'm a total idiot. I left my Facebook open and Gime read everything. We were just fooling around, talking dirty. You know, dumb crap. So Gime told me to take a hike. Is the girl hot? Yeah, very pretty. How old is she? 22, a bit young. If it wasn't a guy. These things happen. You see a nice picture of a woman and end up with a transvestite or someone like that. I have to piss. - He can stay overnight, right? - Sure. Have you eaten? I'm going to bed. I attended the course for like six months. I remember the teacher told us to pick three or four pictures for an exhibition in school at the end of the year. We invited our families and friends. So my mom came. My sister too, all of them. I experimented with night lights and unfocused images. It was a bit weird. But my sister liked it. My mother didn't say much but she liked it too. My dad didn't say a thing. I remember that the next day we were at home sitting on the couch. And my dad told me: "It wasn't nice what you did. That's not photography." So I never went back to the course. Maybe he was right. I don't know. What time is it? Let me check. Nine o'clock. - Wanna eat something? - Okay. I don't mind we only meet on Saturdays. Is it something else? Is there another woman? You're not going to say anything? I'm not a male chauvinist. But I agree with my dad. Camila is 18. She doesn't know what she wants. Dummy! How are you? My father is angry because she spends all days with this fat girl with short hair who has a motorcycle I can't even handle. My dad tells her: I know you're not a dyke but why do you have to hang out all the time with that tomboy? And she says that it's just fashion and that chick has a boyfriend. Who we never saw, by the way. I don't know. What's the point? Your father is too diplomatic. If I was in his place, I'd kick this dyke's butt so hard she'd be flying over Buenos Aires. I could tolerate a queer son. But a lesbian daughter? I'd rather cut my balls off. The thing is... weak fathers bring up queer sons. And when the mother is sort of... What? My mom is really girly, very sophisticated, quiet. And my sister is just... naive. That fat chick is manipulating her. - So, are you going home tomorrow? - Yes. What time? Around eleven. Because I don't work tomorrow. I told Raul I'll skip some Saturdays. This extra money isn't worth it. Are you taking Ornella to buy the stuff she wanted? Yes. - It's Leandro. - Shall I open? No, wait. Dude... I'm with a chick. No, he's not here. Then come by tomorrow. Sure. Bye, you ass. I'm coming on Monday and I'm staying over, okay? Good, please be nice to grandma and grandpa. It's just this weekend. I'll always come on Wednesdays and Saturdays. No, it's just for this weekend. Okay. Me too. I love you, my princess. Yes, bye. Hey, man! Guys from my neighborhood. - Hi, you're not busy, are you? - No, come on in. - How are you guys? - All good, man. Mono, Nico. Gabriel. Hi, how are you? Want some mate? Yeah, I was here once for your birthday party. Your grandma moved the furniture for us to dance. He didn't come because he was too small then. So I've been here before. It was fun. When did you move from our hood? Two years ago. We haven't met since then. He saw you a few times, I didn't. So, do you have a girl now? Sort of. Before we had to ask him how many he was seeing, not who. Remember when you and him fooled around with that slut from our hood? Damn, she was really fine. We were just around and he tells me: Juan lives here. So we came to surprise you. He saw you a few times and I didn't for those two years. - A long time. - Yeah. So what's going on with you now? - We're going to buy some beers. - OK, don't take long. Your name's Gabriel, right? Could you find that magazine you were talking about earlier? - Sure. - Is it not a problem? Thanks, man. - Here. - Thanks, dude. - I'll bring us a beer. - Great. - Is it the last one? - Yeah. It's always like that with those bastards. They took off. - Hey, what's up? - Good. Sorry about yesterday. Nico had plans and we hung out at some friend's house. It was late so I stayed at his place. And you? Did you guys stay up late? I don't know. I went to bed early and left him here. In the morning he was already gone. Don't make me explain myself like you were my girlfriend. Gabo! Come here. - Give Ornella a kiss from me. - Okay. Nice little houses. Who drew them? Grandma. When she doesn't have ideas I suggest her what place or character to draw. Right? Sometimes I can't think of anything. So I tell you things like... three bears, a unicorn, a mountain full of roses, and you get inspired. Yes, for example I once drew a unicorn trapped in the roses that were growing on the mountain and the bears came to save him. You add some fairies, some conflict and you create a story with that. It's amazing. You're going to be late. Right. Daddy, let's see a movie when you come back. Sure. We'll cook meat chops with fries. - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - Did you visit your daughter? Yes. - Gabo, you alright? - Hi. - Let's go to the roof. - Okay. He's annoying. If you don't agree with him, he says you're wrong. And it's not like that. Sometimes other points of view matter. There is no right or wrong. People just think differently. But he doesn't accept it. And I mean, look at yourself first before talking about others. I think Brian's here. He told me he's coming. You don't say anything but you get me, right? I mean, everyone has the right to do whatever they want. But he's so stubborn. I get tired of him. I know he works with you but... come on. - I'll get another bottle. - Great. Hello. - You alright? - Yes, you? Yeah, alright. - I'm getting a beer. - Sure. - I didn't know she was coming. - Okay. They are really awesome. I have never seen anything like that. I've seen them in Tecnopolis and then in Plaza de Mayo. They were jumping off from the buildings. But this show you can't imagine. It was like a theater play. Though I never saw a play and there weren't any famous people in it. Over your head there was like a nylon pool. It was filled with water and girls were jumping in it. All naked and very pretty. There were a lot. And they kept coming. Incredible. Mica was next to me. I think she was a bit jealous. And I was amazed by the show, not the girls. I already saw naked women. But not something like that. Incredible. Gabo? Where have you been? Around. I texted you. Yeah, my phone died. I'm going to bed. I'm tired. Hi. Juan, Natalia was downstairs. Hi. How are you, Dummy. All good? Yes. - Cool movie, I haven't seen it. - Yeah, I know. This one is really scary. The guy is simply crazy and he doesn't get tired. Look at this scene. Where's Yani? She's gone to work. Brian, do you have a condom? No, man. - You, Leandro? - No, I don't. They can't destroy it, they keep shooting and nothing happens. I told you, dude. I am what I am. I do what I can. We couldn't have a better life. We live, sleep and eat together. We wake up by one's side. But I already have a life and I can't change it. I won't change it. I want to play football with the guys and I don't want it to be weird in the showers. I don't want that. You have a daughter. I want my own family. I want a normal life. I don't want to get somewhere... and be pointed at. I don't want that. I was very young, you know. We were both 20 years old. We lived in a small place eight blocks from my parents. Ornella was two. That's why she doesn't remember anything. It was so sudden. She fell ill at work. She fainted. They took her to the hospital and she died. Apparently it was a heart defect that hadn't been diagnosed. And just like that I was on my own with little Ornella. At that time I was very religious, like my parents. And I felt that... I couldn't be completely honest with her. And since I knew I liked guys, it was like a punishment for not being sincere or for desiring men. It took me a long time to get that idea out of my head. To understand that one thing has nothing to do with the other. Yesterday I told her it's over. Good. I want to take Mario to a party. I totally see him there. It's like he's old but at the same time he's a kid. He cracks me up. He's so silly. Can you get that plant for me? Okay. I told Lean I'd help him with the van and I won't make it. - Is it near the park? - Yeah, right there. - Should I simply ask for it? - Exactly. Okay. Hello. I'll take it outside. Juan was afraid you'll get mad. I told him you'd obviously understand. Sure. You see? It's not urgent. Take your time to find a new place. My due date is in May. You can stay till the baby is born. Stop smoking, please. The idea is to fix that room for the baby. No problem. See? It wasn't so hard. I'm going to the bathroom. I want to keep seeing you. With time, we can figure something out. What do you say? When are we going to live together? When grandpa finishes the place upstairs, remember? And what do you do now? I work with plants. I take care of them, put them in the truck, I water them. Does Juan work there too? No, Juan is still working in the old place. So you're not friends anymore? No. Ornella, can I tell you something? Juan was my boyfriend. How? Just like that, we were a couple. So why didn't you tell me before? Because I was ashamed. Oh, daddy...
