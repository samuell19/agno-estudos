The guy's been shot, Jessie. You found him? Yeah. I'm on the 11:00 to 7:00. I pulled over to take a leak and, saw the dog. Don't know him. His wallet and license are still in his pocket. Kenneth Eisley. Big house on the other side of the water. Another commuter who moved here lookin' for paradise. Well, he found it. Looks like 0.22s. It's a murder, isn't it, Jessie? Probably. Do you think the tide washed him up here? A body that's been in the ocean and washed up on shore doesn't look like that. More beat-up. Yep. He's got some marks on his face. That would be the gulls. I could have lived without knowin' that. What about shell casings? No. Maybe the killer picked them up. Or used a revolver. Anthony said on the phone we got a murder? Well, you're the crime scene guy, doc, but there's two bullet holes in his chest. Well, that'll be a clue. He's not in rigor yet. What does that mean? He ran into his killer less than two hours ago. Or killers. D'Angelo, close the area. It's November, skipper. Nobody uses it anyway. This guy did. What about the dog? He's just sittin' there. Jessie, it's Jenn. Are you there? It's late. Guess you're asleep or out on a date. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound like that. I've had a long day. Well, I was pointing to Teaneck, New Jersey when I was giving the forecast for Long Island. Well, actually, it didn't matter. Weather girls aren't taken seriously, anyway. Then I was out all night until now, and the network had this fundraising thing over at the Met, and Craig, my segment producer, took me. Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash. I guess I'll talk to you... seriously, anyway. Then I was out all night until now, and the network had this fundraising thing over at the Met. And Craig, my segment producer, took me. Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash. I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow. Hey. It's 7:00 in the morning. What are you doing here? I'm up early, fighting crime. Can you come over tonight? I'd be foolish not to. We can order in. Chinese? Because you know how erotic I get when I eat chinese. Or when you don't. Age: 37. Divorced, no children. His parents live in Amherst. They've been notified. Well, somebody killed him and they had to have a reason. Talk with the people he worked with. Perkins said he'd get to Eisley's autopsy around lunchtime, skipper. D'Angelo, in all the years I've been a cop, I have never heard the police chief referred to as "skipper." Chief, there's a couple here with their daughter. The Penningtons. What do they want? They didn't want to say, but I think you need to talk with them. Call Captain Healey. Tell him we're sending the bullets down for ballistics. Right. Good morning, folks. I'm chief Stone. Please sit down. My daughter has been raped. Mother! Molly, you might want to stick around. I didn't get raped. Please, honey. She came home late last night. She tried to slip into the house. Her jeans were ripped, her hair was a mess, her lip was bleeding. I insisted on inspecting her myself. She had on no underwear and her thighs were bruised. Did you take her to the doctor? And have it all over town? God, no. I mean, I cleaned her up and brought her straight to you. Cleaned her up? How? I put her in a hot bath and scrubbed her myself, like she was two years old. Who did this to you, Candace? I don't want to talk about it. You tell them, young lady. Candace, if we don't know who did it, it might happen again to somebody else or to you. You tell the chief what happened right now. No hitting. Molly, take Candace outside. Come with me, Candace. Isn't there some kind of a test? Well, a hot bath tends to wash away that kind of evidence, but the hospital might be able to tell us... No, I won't take her. No. Margaret. This entire incident must remain confidential. Can you promise me that? Of course not. We don't plan to blab about it. But if there's a trial, people will find out. We can't discuss this any further. I want my daughter, and we're going home now. You know what? I've said what I have to say. Mrs. Pennington, why don't you let us... I have nothing to say to you. No. Candace. Anything you want to tell me? Poor kid. What are we gonna do? You heard her mother. She doesn't want a scandal. So we're not gonna do anything? I didn't say that. Why don't you go down to the high school? And do what? Keep an eye on her. Find out who did this. How? You'll think of something. Jesse? Yeah. Am I late? No. You can't invite someone over for dinner and just plunk down cartons of food on the table. Of course you can't. I just wanted to see if you knew that. Yeah, right. There's a dog in here. Yeah. Where are you going? Do you want water? Wine. The floor's gotten cold. The season's over. I'm worried. Someone will find him. I just couldn't kill a dog. There you go. Right here. Go, boy. Ready? There you go. You ever met him? Who? The baseball player on your wall. Ozzie? No. But he was the best shortstop I ever saw. Would you have been that good if you hadn't been hurt? I might have made the show, but I wouldn't have been Ozzie. Do you miss it? Every day. Why do you think we get along? I don't know. We're an odd pair. I'm way too old for you. So why do you think we get along? Because we're pals. Pals that have sex. You're like me. You won't commit to a relationship just to have it. Neither one of us requires a commitment from the other. Which produces a kind of commitment to each other. I don't mean this in any negative way, but you may be the simplest person I've ever met. You know what you know, and you do what you do, and you just keep doing it. Like a mule. Or a jackass. One shot, straight through the heart. The other clipped the descending aorta. You want all the details about what got penetrated? I'll read the report. Looks like 40 grain, standard velocity, $10-a-brick ammunition. Almost like a pro. Shots entered the body about 30 degrees apart. What's that mean to you? Hey, I don't know, Jess. I'm a pediatrician most of the time. This is the first murder I've seen. You must have seen lots of stuff like this in L.A. Well, it could mean that the victim moved after the first shot hit him. Or one shooter with two guns. Or two shots at the same time from two shooters. We should pull all the city and state firearm records. Well, good luck. Everyone in the state owns a 0.22. We could cross-reference for people who live in and around Paradise. If the shooter bought in Massachusetts, if the gun store did its paperwork, if we didn't lose it in the computer, and if they live in Paradise. Well, we've got him cornered. What, so we shouldn't? No, go ahead. We have to. But smart criminals don't use registered guns to commit murder. You think he's smart? He or she. Hey, Pennington. What? No hello? Have a look at this. You see these? Don't you say a thing. Actually, that's my favourite. You say anything and you're dead. Okay, okay, we're going to find him. Does he have a car? Listen, I'll have to call you back. Does that translate to, "I've I.D.'d the rapist"? There's a dog in here. Witness protection. Bo Marino. The football player. Football star and two of his teammates. Bo showed somethin' to Candace that scared the hell out of her. You know who the boys were with Marino? Kevin Feeney and Troy Drake. You got anything else? Not yet. You got a plan? I'm going to haunt them. You have to work here some time. My time. Well, it's company time, too. Company business. It's women's business. Men may know things women don't. Yes, but rape is one of the things we know. So I'm going to haunt them. I'm gonna lose my... Don't lean so close... Whoo! Higher! Whoo! Excuse me, are you done with your paper? Thanks so much. Yeah, just keep it. See something you like? Yes. Take a look at this. Yeah, I heard this was a great article. I didn't know you were shooting this. I'm always shooting. But I just wanted to read it. She's the one. She was nice. She wanted to borrow my paper. You think she's good-looking? I think she's great-looking. Want a soda? Thanks. See you later. She looks kind of horsy to me. Thanks a lot. She's the one. How does it make you feel that she's sleeping with other men? She has every right. But how does it make you feel? It makes me want to kill every man she's with. But you don't. Thank you. You're welcome. You know that I'm a wiser person than you. Which gives you the right to offer me advice. Yes. It's a rule. Jessie, you've been divorced now for what, five years? And you advise me to forget about Jenn? I do. Is anyone advising you otherwise? No. If you could resolve this thing with Jenn, then maybe you could put this drinking thing behind you, too. And just be a really good police chief. I've never been drunk on the job. You have never been drunk on the job here. Good point. So? So? Are you suggesting that I shut up? No. Your advice is good. It's just not good for me. Nobody's touched the body. Who was she? Her driver's license says Barbara Carey. Notice she got shot, just like the last guy. Yeah, I noticed. Thought I'd mention it. D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars in the parking lot, license plates so we can read 'em. All of them? Yeah. Who's going to pay for the film? I will. You think the killer's still here? Would you be? You okay? He's interesting. I didn't notice. They're taking down license plates. They'll find our names. So? They'll find a lot of other names, too. You think they'll bring us in for questioning? Smalltown force. I don't think they've got the manpower. It might be kind of exciting if they did. You need a ride? What do you want? To talk. If you want to slump down so nobody sees you, I won't take it personally. There's a dog here. What's his name? What do you think his name is? Reggie? You think he looks like a Reggie? It's what it says on his collar. Hey. Bo Marino, Kevin Feeney, and Troy Drake. We both know they raped you. And we both know they threatened you about telling. How do you know? I'm the police chief. I know everything. If you let them, they will make your life miserable for as long as you live in this town. If you tell me about it, I can give you your life back. My mother is... I can help you with your mother. I want you to call me, any time, about anything. This will be just between you and me until you say otherwise. It's our secret. What are you gonna do? I'm going to haunt them. You won't tell? No. I won't. I'm so scared. I know. But we're in this together, okay? Okay. You're the chief? I am. How come you're not in uniform? Casual Tuesday. Skip Wilder, Boston Herald. No comment. Hey. You came all the way up from Boston to pick up two bullets? Well, I came to see if I could be of some assistance. You can. There's a reporter from the Boston Herald outside. I didn't bring him. Find out if he drives a black BMW. One was following me around. Did you get the license number, skipper? No one ever gets the license number. You heard? I heard. Same M.O.? Same M.O. No obvious motive? I think it might be random. How quickly can your people match the bullets to the ones from the first victim? I'm the state homicide commander. I'm not god. I thought they were the same thing. Think how disappointed I am. It could be a long process. The sooner we confirm it, the sooner we'll have the national media on us. The process just got longer. Thanks. Suit? Write me up a statement for the local paper about how we have this all under control? Me? Yeah, you're good at that. I am? Yeah. Do we? What? Have it all under control. Your wife's on line three. Ex-wife. Call me. Hi. How you doin' up there? You heard? I heard. How about I drive up tomorrow? This isn't a very good time, Jenn. I want to see you. Me, too. I'm very disappointed. I know. I hate just talking on the phone. I know. It's too hard, Jessie. I know. Yes, sir. I understand that. But what about the state police? What about 'em? Is there any reason to think the killings are related? We have two killings. We're not sure whether it's the same weapon or weapons. Thank you. Larry, Curly, and Moe want to talk with you. On behalf of the town council Jim, and Carter, and I thought we ought to get brought up to speed on things. So, what's really going on? We have two killings. We're not sure whether it's the same weapon or weapons. That's all you know? Correct. You don't have any clues, nothing? Correct. Well, hell, I told you he wasn't a talker. So what do we tell the press? I like "no comment." Well, what is it you have your officers doing over at the high school? Maybe you could allocate your personnel a little better. Damn it, don't you talk? Only when I have something to say. Couldn't we get this thing resolved quicker with F.B.I. or state help? The F.B.I. and state police bring the national media. You won't like this town when they're through with it. Look, we think you should take all the resources you have and concentrate on the killings. I'm a cop. I've been a cop for a long time. I'm good at it. I know how to do this. You don't. Damn it, we can fire you. You can. But you can't tell me what to do. Jessie. You know that I'm wiser than you. Is this friendly advice, or are you speaking as the town's lawyer? I'm speaking as your pal. Hey. You want to come over tonight and make dinner? Don't change the subject, and don't piss them off. I bought orange roughy. No bones? No bones. That sounds good. You know what sounds even better? What? Don't piss off the town council, Jessie. So, shall we say 7:00? You know, if you didn't drink so much you could hold that steadier. I know. What do you think? She's too young for him. She's about your age. Yeah. Well, I'm more worldly. Does the killer scare you? Don't shrug. I want you to answer. I suppose I'd be an idiot not to be scared. Would you shoot him? If I had to. Have you ever shot anyone before? Yes. Did you kill 'em? Yes. Do you want to tell me about it? No. So you shot him dead? Yes. Did you mean to? Yes. You didn't try to wound him, you know, shoot him in the leg or something? He had a machete. It feels like you can't catch your breath, and you got some guy with a machete, you aim center of mass and try not to jerk the trigger. When you shoot, you always shoot to kill. It's not like the movies. You've got about half a second to figure out what needs to be done. I guess you need to be that way if you're a policeman. Maybe I'm a policeman because I am that way. Do you think the killings are connected? Don't shrug. Do you have a guess? I try not to. Sure? Well, you're not just a cop. You are, after all, also a person. I'm better at being a cop, and it's best if cops don't hope. I'm not so sure you're a better cop than a person. Lousy cop, too? No. You know what I mean. I know. Thank you. He was shot up here. He must have fallen. Family? Wife, three daughters. I'll talk to 'em. And they won't have any idea why someone killed him. And I'll ask if they know Kenneth Eisley and Barbara Carey, and they won't. And we'll find no connection between the three of 'em. It's the same, only different. We've got a witness. I want to talk to him. Okay. Philly, this is chief Stone. Tell him what you told me. Sure. The streets need paving. With unpaved streets, it's very dangerous. Water in the streets, the street's full of holes. Now, Philly, you told me you saw some cars. Yeah, yeah. Plenty of cars. Police cars, too. No, Philly, before that. Well, there was one car. A red Explorer. You sure about that? No, not really. So did you have a good weekend? Hurry up. Yeah, I got it, man. No problem. Hold it there a minute, Bo. You can't come in here. You're usin' a controlled substance. A what? A controlled substance. You're smokin' a joint. This is a men's room. I'd like you to come down to the station. I don't think so, lady. Don't make me arrest you. You? Get the hell out of my way. You have the right to remain silent. You crazy bitch! If you give up that right, everything you say could be taken down and used against you In a court of law. Watch yourself. So, he could have gotten the color wrong. Exactly. And besides, just because the car was in both places, hell, there's maybe 20,000 red Explorers in the state. Maybe 2,000 in the county. And that assumes they stayed around to watch this. On the other hand, at least we have a credible witness. Chief Stone. Um, your secretary called ahead. Andrew Lincoln. And this is my wife, Brianna. Hello. Hello. This is officer Simpson. Hi. Hi. Please, come in. Suit, why don't you wait here? What did you just call him? Suit. Short for "suitcase." Like Harry "Suitcase" Simpson, the baseball player? Exactly. Please, sit down. Thank you. So, is this about the killings? Yes, ma'am, it is. Your car was in the parking lot of a murder scene. Where that woman was shot. That's where we first saw you, investigating the crime scene. How was I doing? I was wondering if you own any guns, specifically a .22? We do. Registered, of course. A .22 rifle. We used to, um, plink vermin at our country home from time to time. Well, I was wondering if I could borrow it for a couple of days. We'll just test-fire it so we can cross you off the list. Of course, Chief Stone. Jessie. I'll go get it, Jessie. It's a great view, isn't it? On a cop's salary, I could never afford a view like that. We love it. But we're just renting for a few months. Enjoy the seaside, then get to Palm Beach so we don't freeze to death. Good idea. What do you do, Mr. Lincoln? Andy, please. Well, mostly, I manage our money. I used to be an ophthalmologist. I invented an ocular scanning device, that uses laser refraction to detect corneal depth. It's... Anyway... So you don't practice medicine anymore? Why? Do you have something in your eye? Here you go. Thank you. Um, Mrs. Lincoln? Brianna. Brianna, do you work? No, not now. We've been together about 15 years. You know, in that whole time, we've never had an argument. It'd be pretty suspicious if we didn't. Have a fight? No, let you borrow the rifle. It would. I hope you get the son of a bitch, Jessie. We will. People come up from the city and think they own the place. Well, they do. He seemed nice. Just a stupid cop. He didn't seem stupid to me. He seemed polite. He was staring at your ass, for god's sake. I told you he wasn't stupid. I'll have the lab check the rifle for ballistics. It's not the gun, but they did it. We are cops, are we not? And you feel in order to certify our copness, we need to scarf these down? Yes, I do. You're not gonna eat a dozen donuts? Sooner or later. You're right, it's been too long. I want to know everything about Andy and Brianna: where they live, where their country home is, where they plink vermin, where he practiced medicine, where he went to school. "Plink vermin." Who the hell talks like that? People don't talk like that. As soon as we fire the thing, we'll know. We'll know the bullets weren't fired from that gun. What, do you think they have another gun? Two. And you think they did it? Yes. You have everything you need but evidence. That's all that's missing. Except motive. Yeah, well, that, too. But you never told them about their car being at the parking lot. There's no need to tell them all we know. Because you've got some kind of instinct? Because there's something very phony about them. There's a lot of that going around in Paradise. Yeah. But they're the only phonies whose car was parked 10 feet from a homicide. So, you gonna arrest me, or what? I'm walkin' out of here. No, you're not. You think you can stop me? Of course I can. You're all show muscle. Hell, a 120-pound woman hauled you in here in handcuffs. Sit down. Who's the young lady? I don't know. I found those pictures. Where? School library. Somebody must have dropped them. You aren't one of these guys holding her down, are you? Do you see my face in any of those pictures? You don't have to say any more, Bo. Rita Fiore. I'm Mr. Marino's attorney and his son's. I didn't do anything, Dad. What the hell is goin' on? I'm holding Mr. Marino's son on a controlled substance charge. You brought my kid in for smokin' pot? You're lookin' at a police brutality suit. I'm telling you that right now. Shut up, Mr. Marino. We've arrested your client for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell, resisting a lawful order, and assaulting a police officer. And then there is the matter of these pictures. I could see my way to releasing Bo if he would identify the boys holding her down. Chief Stone, my client is 17 years old. He has no previous convictions. You're not really gonna keep him here overnight, are you? I am. I want you to understand something, Bo. You deny knowing the people in these pictures. If you're lying to us, it would be wise if you told us right now with your attorney present. I don't know 'em. Officer Crane, please take Mr. Marino to the holding cell. Come on. You son of a bitch. Chief son of a bitch to you. Now, unless you want to spend the night here, too, I suggest you and Miss Fiore go someplace and plan your brutality suit. I'll meet you outside. Healey told me you were... What did he say? It was kinda cute. Yeah. He said you were a real straight shooter. That is cute. See you. Why're you keepin' the kid overnight? Because I don't like him. How was the father? The tree doesn't grow too far from the apple. If you flip one of the other kids, there might be a plea-bargain and she'd never have to appear. You look tired, Jessie. You can only do what you can do. If the killings aren't random, they're certainly connected in a way only the killers understand. Suit said you've got a feelin'. Cop-ly intuition. So, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna eat my pizza and mull. Mullin's good. Good night, Jessie. Good night, Moll. I know you're married, but maybe we could have an affair. I'll put you on the list. Anyway, there's this... There's this banquet hall and it's... It's brightly lit, and there's a big, warm fire. And outside, it's cold and dark. But inside, everybody's eatin' and drinkin' and having a hell of a time. And a... And a sparrow flies into one end of the hall out of the cold darkness. And he flies through the bright, warm hall and out the other end into the cold darkness again. So? Human life is like the flight of that sparrow. Or was it a swallow? I don't remember. But the point's the same. We're only here for a little while and we have the right to make the most of it. Yeah, I know, Reggie. "You can only do what you can do." Do you know bo Marino? Did he take those pictures? I don't know. Was someone holding her feet? I don't know anything. Okay, Kevin. I'm gonna have to arrest you for sexual assault. No, wait a minute. Am I going to jail? We have pictures of you forcibly restraining a naked young woman who is crying. There's probably a crime in there someplace. Tell him, Kevin. Was it Bo Marino? Do you want to go to jail? He'll be pissed at me. Was it Bo Marino? Yes. Who else? Troy. Troy Drake? Yes. Maybe you'll sleep home tonight. He's never been in trouble before. And now he is. But he's not gonna go to jail, is he? Not tonight. But, Mrs. Feeney, your son participated in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl. He'll have to answer for that. What else? Andrew Lincoln married Brianna Douglas in 1988. They lived in Cleveland while he was a resident at case medical center, through 1990. And they have two cars: the red Explorer and a black BMW. Black BMW. How'd you know that? I'm the police chief. I know everything. Listen, I've to call you back. Hold that thought. Miss Fiore. Save the "Miss" for court. Is this a house call? Pour me a drink, would you? A very large, very dry martini. How's vodka on the rocks? You have kettle one? I do. My plan was that you'd be so taken with my appearance that you'd do whatever I wanted. It's working. That was a lousy way to get Bo charged with sexual assault. He deserved it. I could take you apart in court for that. But if I did, how would I get you into bed? Are you thinking long thoughts? Mostly, I'm thinking "wow." Good. I like "wow." In the small moments, between thinking "wow", I want you to know I've done a little background research. Thorough. I am very thorough. I also have the resources of a huge law firm. Try not to babble. I had to know what I was dealing with. You were a homicide detective in Los Angeles, but your marriage went south and you had a drinking problem. How's the marriage? Still south. And the drinking? Better. I also know that you have a serial killer operating here. I do. You must be stretched pretty thin. We are. But you still had time to run down this rape thing. Usually, you get into one of these small, suburban towns and they have a homicide, and the state police take over the investigation pretty quickly. We try to handle as much as we can in-house. Buy me dinner. I'll dress up. Fluff up my body a little. Wow. I know how much pressure you must be under now and we really appreciate you taking the time for this. Candace and I always knew who raped her. But we agreed that if we blew the whistle and corroborated, we might not get them, and that'd make her life very difficult in Paradise. They were gonna show my picture to everyone. Well, now they probably won't. I'll give a statement. I'll testify, if I have to. Good for you. Get off me! You can't go in. You can't go in. This is a bunch of crap. Kevin Feeney lied. I'm sorry, skipper. It's all right, Tony. Close the door behind you. My kid told you he didn't threaten her. He told her that if she testified against him, he'd kill her. Come on, it's just his word against hers. Don't force me to make that choice. What's that supposed to mean? It means I have found Bo to be a chronic liar. I didn't do anything to the little bitch. Let go of my son! Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch arrested for assault. Take it easy. Sit down, Mr. Pennington. I promise they won't assault you again. What? You saw the whole thing. I saw you and Bo insult Candace Pennington and attack her father. You see it any different, Mr. Pennington? No, that's the way I saw it. Me, too. He punched my kid for no reason. I think there was a reason. What, the picture of you in my bedroom? What do you do with it when you have a sleepover? It stays. They have to know about you. So, what do you think? About sleepovers? No, about me coming up. See, every news outlet in the country is dying for some sort of inside something on this. I know. I thought I could come out with a cameraman and track the investigation. An inside look at how you're handling it. No. We could do a whole series about it. No, Jenn. I'd stay out of the way. Means so much to my career. Hey, Abby. Hey, Jessie. Two in the chest, just like the others. Cold morning. Might make the time of death a little harder. Hey, hey, doc. Not now. Jessie, I'm sorry. Maybe I should just say, "the hell with it," and be a drunk. God knows I'm good at it. I don't see what purpose is served by locking these children up. You think they didn't know it was wrong? You think they couldn't control themselves? Well, they didn't. No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time. Right now, Candace can't imagine going to school tomorrow. She cannot imagine facing all the kids that will know she was gang-raped and photographed naked, and the three guys who did it will be in the same school with her. Maybe the same class. I may not be a little girl anymore, but I am a woman. And as a woman, I sympathize with her. Did the court specify the community service? Not yet. Do I have an input in this? What would you have us do? Let me have each of 'em in a cell for an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them. You're joking? I am. But why not let them serve their sentence with the police department? You would, of course, take your supervisory responsibilities seriously. I would bust their chops. And I wouldn't lay a hand on 'em. I'll see what I can do. What about unsolved murders in the Cleveland area? Nothin' that matches. A young girl was shot at a bus stop in Parma, which is near Cleveland. I know where Parma is. The only thing that matches this M.O. are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999, and three in Florida, 2002. Where in Florida? Palm Beach. There's a guy from CNN here. He wants to speak with you. Who is it? I don't know. He won't like that. There's a press briefing every morning. Tell him where and when. Okay. Maybe now we can get a search warrant. No judge is gonna give us a search warrant with what we've got. And the weapons won't be there. We can try. I don't want 'em to stop! Suit? That's good work. You may make detective someday. We don't have any detectives. Well, if we did. I'm sorry about your girlfriend. She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal. No, thank you. You're not drinking? I don't drink. I did, but I don't. Well, here. I hate to drink alone. The D.A. went for your plan. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna take them over to doc Perkins and have them sterilized. The Marino family wants me to file charges against you. It all happened so quickly. I'm sure. I could tell you're kind of slow to react. Well, Bo attacked Candace's dad who responded in self-defense. Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck had to defend himself from both of them. And that's how you'll testify in court? Absolutely. I was a prosecutor in a previous life. Don't beat yourself up. It's the toughest kind of case: motiveless, random killing. It seems that serial killers only screw up when it gets personal. So, when do we go to court? This one isn't a winner for our side. I'll persuade my clients to drop it. And if they won't? They'll drop it. So, off the record, what really happened with Bo and his father? Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo and his old man, and I let him. I'm shocked. Not that shocked. No. It'll be our secret. Perhaps before we're through, there'll be several more. Jessie. Ballistics came back on the third victim. Same as the first two. Same two guns. Who else knows about this? So far, just you and me. Good. But I'm runnin' out of excuses. It's freezin' out here. The day I left L.A.P.D., I drove out to Santa Monica and just looked out at the ocean. I lost my wife and my job. It calmed me. Are you feelin' that way now? No. I'm angry. They killed my friend. So you think it was intentional, this killing your friend? Yes. I know who did this. I know who killed Eisley, and the woman in the parking lot, the guy in the alley, and Abby. I know who killed them. Do you have a motive? No. Witnesses? No. Weapon? No. Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now. There's two of them. And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them. They seem to have an interest in me and maybe I can encourage them to develop it. So these two people, they have an interest in killing people and now they seem to have an interest in killing you? Is this a great country or what? Jessie, you might want to be a little careful with these people. I'm a little careful with everyone. The hell you are. It would not be good to take this personally. I've been at this thing too long to be wrong. I'm not gonna sit around and wait for someone to find another body. You just love to make me nervous. Need a ride? He's gonna see you. That sounds good. You know what sounds even better? What? He looks tired. I think he looks worried. Maybe we've been too hard on him. Human life is like the flight of that sparrow. Jessie? Andy? This is Reggie. Thought you might need this. Come on in. They took a ballistics test? Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston. Come, come into the living room. Brianna doesn't wanna miss you. Bri, honey, it's Jessie. I assume it's not linked to a drive-by shooting or anything. Actually, the rifle's never been fired. So much for plinking vermin. Must have been one of your other .22s. No. I have no other guns. Jessie Stone. Brianna. Hello. What a beautiful dog you brought! How clever. What a sweet doggie. Hello, you little noodle. Actually, I've kind of adopted him. He belonged to the first victim. Well, that's awfully good of you. How sweet. I think he likes you. Of course he likes me. You going someplace? Well, like we said, we're only here a short time. When do you leave? Tomorrow night. How's the investigation going? Actually, not too good. I hope the victims didn't suffer too much. I wonder what it's like to know you're gonna die. Have you ever been in that position, Jessie? I'm just a smalltown cop. Mostly, I give out parking tickets. It must make everything very intense. I always wondered what it was like for the shooter. That must be intense. Exercising the ultimate human power. If the shooter thinks about that kind of stuff. Do you think he does? I'm just a smalltown cop. Mostly, I give out parking tickets. Do you have any leads? I was pinning my hopes on you. Everyone needs a hobby. Seriously, though, why would we do such a thing? A shared sickness. At least we would be sharing. Jessie, who was the last victim? A friend of mine. Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper. It must be very hard when it's someone so close to you. I'm sorry. So am I. "Abigail, abigail have you met abigail?" "The queen of the tack to the ladies" How is it? My mother is like kind of sulky. Yeah. And your father? Daddy's great. You know, I never saw him fight with anybody before, for me. You didn't try to stop it. He was winning. Well, daddy boxed in college. Well, he must've been pretty good. There's not a mark on his face. Did you ever box? I don't box, I fight. What's the difference? Rules. So, how is it at school? You know, sometimes Bo or Troy will like stare at me when I go past. But, you know, they don't say anything. Yeah. Everyone else, um, like most of the kids, have been okay about it. Good. You know, I want you to know I appreciate what you did for me. Could you do me a favor? Sure. Well, Reggie here has got no owner, no family. You know, I'm never home and he really needs someone to look after him. Could you do that? I don't know, my mom... I can talk to your mom about it. But you've to take care of him. Feed him, walk him, clean up after him. I know. I can do it. I know you can. Jessie? What? I'm... I'm sorry about your friend. Thank you, Candace. So, why Abby? Because she was close to me. So you think they want to kill you next? I kind of wish they'd try. I know they're not finished. Well, they know where you live. Why don't they lurk around your house and shoot you? They want to do something more artistic. They are crazy. I tend to forget that. I think they made a mistake. It's not random anymore. They seem to want to taunt me, see my reaction. You might want to think about being a little careful. I need evidence. You think they'll come at you the same way? Serial killers like ritual. They'll do it the same. Jessie, you're a good man and a good cop. Better than this town deserves. It matters what happens to you. The ugly truth of it, Moll, is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me. A lot of people love you, Jessie. Including you? Especially me. And don't shut me off by being cute. It's hard for me not to be cute. I think Reggie will be good for Candace. That was sweet. Jessie, it's me. I'm... Jessie, it's Candace. I don't know if I thanked you enough for all that you've done for me. I mean, you did so much, and now maybe Reggie and... Well, I just wanted you to know that I'm your friend and I feel really close to you. Okay, bye. Hello? It's Jessie. Jessie. Yeah. Listen, I need to see you both before you leave. The parking lot by the canal, where Abby Taylor was killed. You know. When? Tonight, 10:00. Is this official? No, it's personal. If I'm right, they'll be there. Stupid cop. He thinks he's setting some sort of trap. Can he do anything? It doesn't matter. This just makes it easier. Now we know where he'll be. Why am I here, again? You've got kids and a husband. That's lovely and chivalrous of you and I know you do it because you care about me, but it's still demeaning. You see anything, suit? Nothing yet. Jessie? Yeah. What if you're wrong? That's why I've got you, Molly. Jessie, I don't think they're coming. Yes, they are. They're here. We'll get there as soon as we can. You got that, suit? On our way. I won't have a dog in my house. This is different. I'll take care of him. Except for when you don't. Dad. Margaret, this means so much to her. You know the rule. Can't we bend the rule this time? Reggie needs a home. You know how I feel about animals in the house. He's a great dog. He's already housebroken. I promise I'll take care of him. Margaret. But I really want him. I won't have a dog in my house. This is different. I'll take care of him. Except for when you don't. Dad. Margaret, this means so much to her. Candace isn't home. Pick it up. And let you execute me? Pick it up. I didn't shoot anybody. I may do some jail time, but no court of law will execute me. I'll outlive you, Jessie. Get up. Put the gun away, suit, before you shoot somebody. You all right? Yeah. Two guns, one shooter. Give that to Healey. What are you lookin' at? Jessie, are you there? I'm sorry. I want you to know that I realize I was thinking only about myself and my career. And I know I've often been that way with you. Jessie, are you there?
