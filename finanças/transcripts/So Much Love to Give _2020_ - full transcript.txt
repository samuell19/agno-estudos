This is me. I seem to be like everyone else. However there's something that makes me different. My heart is too big. A regular heart is 4.72 inches long and 3.54 inches wide. Mine too, but it suffers from a rare anomaly. My heart is able to love more than anyone else's. Paula is traveling in that ambulance you just saw. She's my first love. -Did he fall from a tree? -Yes he did. Dad is going to the hospital! We started dating in "Cerebro" in our trip to Bariloche. Be careful with that alcohol. Don't do that, it's alcohol! No, no! Paula means everything to me. She knows how to make me happy, and I her. We are a perfect match. This is me again. I'm the orthopedics chief at the municipal hospital of Mar Del Plata and I work here from Monday to Thursday. Today is Thursday. -Hello? -Tell me you're on your way. Don't start with that, I'll be leaving in ten minutes. -Don't be late, we have guests. -Who did you invite? I was going to do something bigger, but... I decided to go for something more intimate: mom, my brother... I'll handle that, calm down. My husband is Fernando Ferro, he works here. -My eyes are burning! -Are you listening, Fer? I'm listening, don't get angry, I'll be leaving in ten minutes. -Don't be late! -Okay, I send you a kiss. If I go blind I'll kill myself. I'll jump to the sea like Alfonsina! You won't go blind, stop being a drama queen! Did you see what the ophthalmologist said? Did you listen what the ophthalmologist said? You'll be fine with that antibiotic. On top of that you'll leave and I won't see you until Sunday. I have to be there, I have a scheduled surgery! I have to be there, Pipi. -What kind surgery? -Head of femur! I live in this house with Paula and our daughters. 205 square yards. This year we'll finish paying the mortgage we signed back in 2000 during De La Rua's government. If the eye doesn't close quickly enough to avoid contact with alcohol, you can go blind -because alcohol dries it. -I'll kill myself! Pipita, you don't have to read those things to mom. Pour her some tea. Pipi, my love, you'll be fine, it's just a couple of days. -My God... -Maru is here, open the door. As soon as I arrive to Buenos Aires I'll call you. Calm down, Pipi. What happened? -Stay with them, please. -Fer, Fer! -Call me more than usual! -Less phone... -What happened? -Maru! You have to tell me you're going to kiss me! I love you! -Call me! -What happened to you? Next September 20th is going to be nine years that I do this trip every Thursday, 259 miles to Buenos Aires. I usually travel earlier, but today's incident with Paula delayed me. I'll be there to cut the cake and kiss you. I'm going as fast as I can. I'm driving now, I love you, kisses. It's time for the process. Next October 16th it's going to be nine years that I do this, systematically. It's a relatively simple process, but requires a lot of attention. It's a change I make to my life every Thursday evening before I arrive in Buenos Aires. I always tell mom, it's only a glass per day... I'm here! He's here! I knew he'd make it! Of course! What's up, Fer, don't you have a watch? I met Vera ten years ago. She's also a doctor. We were colleagues at first, then friends with benefits, until one day we realized we could be more than that. Vera means everything to me. She knows how to make me happy, and I her. We are a perfect match. -You really know me, I love red. -It's a great gift, Fer. Really great. Now! -Happy birthday to you... -Happy birthday to you... -Happy birthday to you... -Happy birthday to you... All the way! You're great! The day that Vera arrived to my life I understood how my heart worked. Because, for the first time, I felt complete. I love them madly, and I was loved by two beautiful women. Kiss, my love. You're going to be fine, Pipi, you heard the doctor. -There was some dancing missing... -Well, next time. If I were you, I'd be complaining all day, but you're stronger than me. Okay, honey, I'll call you tomorrow, I love you. Kiss the girls for me. Hello... What a night! -You're tipsy. -No. -You're a little tipsy, right? -No. What's up? I want to blow the candle again. FRIDAY -I'm leaving, darling. -Okay. Please, tell Silvia to delay my first appointments. -I'll arrive a little late. -Why, what happened? I have to take Moncho with my brother. He's still limping. But there's nothing wrong with its leg, I think it's the prostate. What are you saying? Moncho is still young. He's not so young, he's seven. Plus, he's virgin. His prostate must be... It's swollen but I don't see any tumors. For now. What are you suggesting? Preventive action. Let's do it. In 2010, our family economy needed reinforcement. Thanks to a contact from a colleague, I got a job in this hospital, Fridays and Saturdays. It's a complication to come from Mar Del Plata but it's worth it. I'm well paid. Hello, good morning. Tell me again about Jime, I don't get it. We're trying to find balance, so the couple still work. The other day she told me: "Would you come with me to therapy?" It was a woman psychologist. I was bullied by those two for 50 minutes... That's your mistake, you don't have to go to her therapy. You don't do that, it's a law. I wanted to fix the situation, and I tell her: "Maybe I'm not the man you're looking for". Then, the psychologist came in front of me, I thought she was going to head butt me, I stood still, but she told me: "Coward!" What kind of therapy is she taking? We have to pay $2400 per session, no refunds. I've never heard anything like that. -Hi! -What happened, it was the prostate? It has the size of an orange, poor thing. -It's a tumor? -Not yet. But Nacho suggested to take precautions and we did it. What do you mean by that? Did he neuter him? Fer, it was the best for him. He would die in two years, otherwise. Poor Moncho. Can you go with me to the market later? -The fridge is empty. -Yes, of course. I have to go now, my patients are waiting. Poor Moncho. He never had sexual intercourse. Poor thing. A neutered virgin. Last year we didn't do anything. Between my mother's surgery and your congress in Cancun, nothing. Well, I didn't do anything, you at least got some days at the beach. I spent all days locked at the hotel. Don't lie to me, you returned so tanned. Okay, what are you thinking? -Thailand. -No, no! It's too far! -No, I don't like it. -It's different, other culture. Besides, it has wonderful beaches, Lucre went there last year and she showed me amazing photos. -We'll see, we'll see. -No, don't say that. We always say the same thing -and we end up doing anything. -Miami, Miami! -No, not again! -Yes, I like that sun... We deserve better holidays. Okay, we'll see. Don't make me that face! Please. Okay, we'll talk. Okay, what do we need? You take care of drinks and cold stuff -and I'll take care of the rest. -Get some chocolate and sandwich cookies. What's going on? Why are you laughing? -Nothing, it's... -We were watching the video when a jellyfish stung you in Cancun, remember? On your neck. That damned jellyfish ruined my holidays. And now I'm blind. That's my phone. Give me my phone, it must be dad. -It must be dad! -Calm down, mom! -Here it is. -Give it to me. -Hello. -You have to pick it up. -Hello. -You have to pick it up! Help me with that, I can't see! -There, there it is. -Hello! How are you, Pipi? Nothing changed, I don't know. I think it's worse, because your daughters are stuck to me like marmalade. Both of them are there? Didn't Sofi go to practice? No, she took advantage of my situation and didn't go. Maru is here, too. Hello, hello! Stock clerk Jessica, you're needed at the milk section. Where are you, at the supermarket? I came here to buy some stuff, the apartment is empty. Buy healthy food, Fernando, don't buy anything frozen. -Okay. I'll call you later. -Wait a second. Did you get tuna? I feel a little insecure with my blindness, can you return earlier this Sunday? -Who is it? -Gonza. I'll be there, don't worry. -Kisses. -Kisses. -Kisses to Gonzalo? -What? -You said "kisses" to Gonzalo. -I didn't say that. -You said "kisses". -Are you jealous of Gonza? -Did you get some wine? -I was going to do that. -Hi, Pipi! -Fer, how good to...! No, no, stop! Here is your hero, my love. -You're so mean! -Why? What did they...? It's nothing. Don't you think it's a little irresponsible for you to go to Buenos Aires with those kids while you're blind, mom? I've been planning this trip for six months! I have permission from all the parents, I'll take those kids to Buenos Aires, besides, Guada will be there with me. And the doctor told me that I'll be fine by Tuesday! -I'll take these out! -No, no, no! Don't do it. Tomorrow you'll take them out. Don't you laugh, don't be so mean. -Fer, I'm messed up! -Don't cry, dear. Take me a picture with your mom. -No, not like this! -Smile. Look at me. Dad, you're so gross! The closest star to the sun it's Proxima Centauri, one of the stars of the system Alpha Centauri. Come on, Mateo! Let's go. Say bye to the robot! Bye, robot! This way, kids, let's go. Stay still, Pipi. There it is. What's up? It was nothing, don't be a drama queen. -I just remembered. -What? What happened? I saw someone just like you in the planetarium. Just like me? As handsome as me? Yes. There are some screens where they show pictures of the guests, and there was a guy in an astronaut suit just like you. He was with a kid. I don't know if it was my poor sight, but I was shocked. He was identical. Maybe I have a double in the planetary. They say everyone has a double. I'm sure you have a double, not as beautiful as you, but there must be someone. Do you want to watch the last three episodes of the season? No, you watch it, I can't focus very well yet. Okay, then. I'm going to get some chocolate. This Friday will be our anniversary. Yes, I... -I bought you a present, did you? -You're lying! I'm not lying. How many years is it? -Nineteen. -I though you forgot about it. You won't be there, Fernando, neither next year because it will be Saturday. I was there last year, it was Thursday. -Don't you remember? -It was awful, a quick lunch by the hospital and then you left to Buenos Aires. -The food choked me. -Do you think I like to travel from Mar Del Plata to Buenos Aires every week? I have responsibilities, it's my job. I'll go get a chocolate. I don't want to spend our anniversaries like this, it's awful. I don't like it. Maybe we can celebrate in advance the bicentenary party as well, don't you think? Where are the kids? It's in God's hands... No, Fer, don't do that dog thing. I can't resist it. Stop it! THURSDAY -Hi, how are you? -Hello. I'd like to talk to the manager, please. What's the issue? It's about an image right. This image. It's the first time someone complains about this. People love to appear on the screens, generally. I don't like to be seen in any screen. I don't want to be in that video. Do you understand? Are you saying you'd like to be paid for being in the video? No... Didn't you listen what I'm saying? I told you three times already, you won't ruin my life. It's a delicate issue, take me out of that video now, please. -I can't decide that. -Who can? -My boss. -Where's he? -Not here. -Give me his number. -I can't do that. -Listen, you don't know me. I'll return tomorrow, if I'm still in that video I'll burn this flying saucer down with all the Martians inside. Do I make myself clear? Enough with that tablet, son. Enough, Gasti. Gastón! I'll take Moncho to pee. We'll be right back. Okay. Shut that down, son. Enough already. Stay here, Monchito. Be quiet, very quiet. Happy anniversary to the most beautiful girl of this whole planet. I fell asleep on the couch. What a nice surprise. It would be nice to celebrate together so many years. This Sunday we'll go out for dinner wherever you want. Then we'll return home to set those sheets on fire. Are you going to sleep now? It's midnight, I'm so tired. What time is it in Mar Del Plata? You idiot, it's midnight too! You know I still love you, right? I'll always love you, Pipi. You know that, right? How are the girls doing? They're insufferable. They're fine. Okay, I'm going to sleep, my eyes are closing. I loved the surprise. I love you. I love you too. Next time you have to ask before using a photo without permission. Thank you very much, good evening. Idiot. -Come in! -I'm leaving, darling. Do you want to go to the movies, later? Okay. Wait, what about Gasti? -Nancy. -No, not Nancy. She's expensive, and she always have problems with time... She's the only one I can trust, Fer. Okay. But I prefer something light, -Some comedy or action, no drama. -A comedy. They told me there's a good one. What was the title? Excuse me, where can I find doctor Fernando Ferro? Orthopedics, second hallway to the left. Okay, I'll meet you there. I have to see my mother. She fell off the escalator at the mall. When did that happen? -What happened? Is she injured? Dead? -No, I would've told you if she died... I mean, is she injured? Watch out for your mother. I know, but if she doesn't stop drinking whiskey, I don't know what'll happen. -It's no joke. -Give me a kiss. You have a little lipstick on... -Bye! -Bye, honey. Come in! Surprise! Hi, Paula! Are you okay, Fernando? I wanted to sneeze, but... -Hi... -What are you doing here? Sorry, I left my phone. -I'm so sorry. -It's okay. Sorry. What? Don't look me like that! I rented a room in a boutique hotel in Puerto Madero and reserved a table for two in a nice restaurant in front of the hotel. I couldn't stand being alone in our anniversary. What's going on? Are you worried about the price? It was a special offer! I thought after so many years of sacrifice we deserved a romantic night. -But... -What's going on? I'm so happy, it's been so many years you didn't come here, and now I'm shocked and excited. If you don't like the idea I'll cancel everything! I'm very happy. -Fernando! -What? I thought you didn’t... I was about to cry. What time do you leave? What time do you finish with your patients? -What patients? My patients? -Yes. I don't know, there's four, five, six, seven, eight, I don't know. Two or three hours, maybe. Okay, let's do this. I'll go to the hotel, and take a bath in the Jacuzzi and prepare myself for you. We have a reservation for 9:30 p.m. I'll text you the address. It's crossing the bridge, okay? I'm happy to do something different. I'm really... happy that you're here. Bye. What a man. Dr. Ferro looking after his patients outside the hospital. You must've done this more than once over the last 10 years and you kept quiet. Did you understand what you have to do? -Yes, yes. -Call me 9:10. -Three times. -That's what I didn't get. -Why three times? -I won't answer the first two calls. Son of a... By then, the movie would've started half an hour ago, so you have to say it's something urgent. Yes, "Doctor Ferro, we need you in orthopedics". It's not an airport, calm down, say it more natural. I'll say: "If it's not an emergency, I won't go". -Understand? -Yes. You are asking something complicated. You have to plan in advance-- I don't have time! -Sorry. I can't mess this up. -Speak louder, I can't hear you. -She came from Mar Del Plata. -From Mar Del Plata? Yes, but it's delicate... So you have her in your phone by the name "La Feliz"? Tell me more. She must like you a lot to come from Mar Del Plata. 9:10. Three calls. Your phone. -Fer. -What? Your phone is ringing. They're calling you, Fer. -I won't pick it up. -Pick up. I don't want to. Fer, pick it up. They won't stop calling you until you pick it up. -I don't want to. -Pick it up, it's an emergency. They won't leave me alone! Hello? I'm at the theater, I can't talk. What's up? Do you want me to go now? I'll be there in 15 minutes. What happened? -It's an emergency. -What? Broken collar bone, a woman, 85 years old. Okay, let's go. Let's go. -Excuse me. -Sorry. -Come here a second. -What? It makes no sense for you to come with me, I have to work. It's not a problem, I'll go with you. As you wish. Okay, I'll stay here. It's a good movie. I'll be home in three hours. -Okay. -Wait for me. What a shame! Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Where am I? What happened? -Relax, calm down. -Who hit me? Relax, you hit your head. Don't you remember? -There was an accident, a truck... -Am I okay? You'll be fine, calm down. What's your name? Silvia, but they misspelled my name. Relax. My phone. My phone! Stay still! Don't move! Or else I'll have to strap you down! No, please, I'm a doctor and there was an emergency, -I need to go now. -Relax, we have to scan you, so stay still. We called your wife, she's coming. Which wife, Silvita? Which wife? Silvita, which wife? Silvita! -Vera! I was so scared... -Fer! Honey! I was lucky. -Let me see. -A truck crossed in red light. -What a mess. -Is something wrong? Look over here. Follow my hand. -What time is it? -You're fine. -What time is it? -A quarter to ten. What? Fer, lay your head, you hit it hard, come on. -I have an emergency. -Fernando, you hit your head! You can't get up. Calm down, relax. I already called Gonzalo, it's done. He'll take care of the surgery, it's all under control. -Relax. -Gonzalo... But this hospital's management is not under control. I can't get it, I called you when the movie ended, and a nurse picked it up, or else I wouldn't find out. -Didn't they call you? -They didn't! It's insane. Lay your head. He'll take you to make a MRI. Here are your phones. You can't go there with your phone. This isn't his phone. It's not mine. Lay your head. Fer! He's my husband, wait a second. He's my husband! -Fer, what happened to you? -It was nothing, I'm fine. Lower your voice, please. Why do I have to lower my voice? We're in a hospital, people get scared. Don't talk, don't look, don't listen. Don't do anything. -Go back to the hotel. -Is he having a stroke? He's having a stroke! It's not a stroke! It's just a routine check. Go to the hotel, now. I'll be there with you in an hour, love. I don't think so, you have to stay here at least three hours. -Are you an idiot? -Why do you talk to him like that? Why did he say that? What do you do? -I'm a nurse, and a stretcher-bearer. -Which one? -Stretcher-bearer. -Then speak as one! I'm an orthopedic surgeon and if I say I'll go in an hour, -that's it! -Fer, calm down, please. I'll be here, do what you have to do. -Don't listen. Don't talk. Don't look! -Go, my love. Hurry up, please. Hurry up, please! Hi, let me ask you a question. Fernando Ferro was admitted recently and maybe he'll have to stay, do you know which room will he use? -Fernando Ferro? -Yes. -Room 505. -505, thanks. -Hello. -Hi. Are you looking for Fernando? I'm Gonzalo. Gonza. Gonza! Gonza! I'm Paula. -Paula! -Gonza! What a situation to meet each other! I'm so happy. You're the most-discussed subject on Sundays. -Yes? -When Fernando arrives he's always "Gonza this, Gonza the other", my daughters are sick of that. -Daughters? -Yes. -He told me you're in a bad time. -Yes. -Did you break up yet? -We're on it. What a shame. It's so nice to finally meet you! Do you want to wait for him in the room? I don't think he'll get a room. -She told me, room 505. -She told you that to stop bothering her. -Why don't we sit down here? -Gonza! This is so nice. You're like a brother to Fer. Josefina is outrageous. She wants to become a model. She was so close to her sister when she was young, but now they fight all day. They have different personalities. -And they're Fernando's daughters. -Who else could they be? Today is our 19th anniversary of our wedding. -Wow. -Yes, wow. I came from Mar Del Plata to surprise him and celebrate, but... What a shame. Look at this mess, poor Fernando. -Poor guy. -Yes. -Here he comes. -Yes, but stay here. They won't let us in, until he's settled in his room. If you listen to me, you'll understand. -Okay, okay, right. -Sorry. He'll be controlled until tomorrow... Who's that woman? The doctor. Dr. Seligmann. She's a neurologist. A neurologist, okay, it's good that they check his head. Doctors told me everything's fine, so you can go home and pick me up tomorrow at 8 or 9 a.m. Gonza is outside, do you want me to tell him -to stay with you tonight? -I don't want anyone here. I want to be alone. You take care of Gasti, because Nancy is the most expensive babysitter in the world. I could stay with you. -I'll stay. -Don't bother. The doctor gave me some pills and they're making effect now. -Okay. -Go and rest at home. -Okay, love. Take care. -It was stressful. -I know. -Go. -Rest. -Go, go. It's Nancy. She called me a thousand times. -Here is your phone. -Go. -Room 505, it was right. -Is it this one? I'm leaving! I don't know, maybe 15 or 20 minutes. As soon as I can, Nancy. -Doctor... -Everything's fine. It was just a bang, he has to stay until tomorrow. I have to go or the babysitter will be gone. -Doctor! -Relax, everything's fine. -Darling, what a day! -I was so scared. You were so lucky. I'll be dismissed in an hour and we'll leave. No, no. Dr. Seligmann said you have to stay here... Doctor Seligmann doesn't know a thing! Fernando, I don't recognize you anymore. Why do you talk like that? I'm sorry, but I know doctor Poidomani, he's the area chief and he told me I'll be leaving in an hour. I think it would be better for you to stay here this night because you hit your head and it's dangerous. Don't do this... I'm an orthopedic surgeon, do you know more than me? -Come on, Pipi. -Okay. Do you want to eat something? Maybe some coffee. I feel a little down... you could bring me, I don't know, some cannelloni. -Cannelloni? -I mean, my pressure is down. Maybe some chocolate. Wait, I'm missing something very important! My cell phone. Yes... Okay, I'll ask for it. I have to thank you for what you've done. Relax, relax. Easy on that! Are you crazy? You told me she was just a girl. She's your wife! Yes. -Do you have two families? -Yes. Who are you, Saddam Hussein? Do you have eight wives? -Are you an Arab sheikh? -Why do you talk without knowing? Polygamy is more common than you think. It's practiced in many parts of the world. Afghanistan, Algeria, Myanmar... Cameroon, Qatar, Congo, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq... Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco. You're in Argentina, idiot! No, you have to... So the truck came from the side -and I didn't see it... -Here you have. A sandwich cookie and your cell phone. She didn't want to give it to me! She told me you said it wasn't yours. -Me? -I told her you hit your head and could've said anything, but she refused. I said: "Do you know why it's his? It has a Boca sticker on it, give it to me." And she did. What an idiot, she talked to me as if I weren't your wife. I was so mad. -Do you want me to open it? -Please. -Fer. -I don't want to talk. I can't do it right now. -But are you okay? -Yes, but I'm still in shock. I still see that truck in my head. You can rest in the apartment. -Here's your water. -Thank you, Pipi. We can't even kiss in your condition. Happy anniversary, darling. Happy anniversary, I ruined your night, you look gorgeous. If something bad happens to you I would die. But... Don’t cry, nothing's going to happen to me, I'm okay now. Listen, Fernando, I have to leave at 6 a.m. because the girls are alone. Why don’t you come with me? I would be more secure. -I can't. -Why not? Some day you'll have to stop working. I have to see the woman that broke her collar bone. What woman? I told you about her. -No, you didn't tell me about her. -Yes, I told you... No. She's the mother of someone I know, she twisted her body and broke her collarbone, she's 92 years old. And she told me: "Fernando, I want you to see me", -I couldn't say no to her. -Please, Fernando... I would feel more secure if you came with me. I would feel better if you take some rest and leave early in the morning to Mar Del Plata because the traffic is chaotic. -I know. -Relax. I love you. Me too. Did you notice your ring is missing, right? What? Your ring was stolen. I'm sure the nurses took it! Damn it! SUNDAY What's up, dude? Everything's okay? -Look what they did to your car... -Yeah. Do you want me to wash it, still? No, look the state of it. Leave it as it is. Can you spare me some bucks? For the trouble... You're so cheeky. Here you have. Thank you! See you later. No! You wrecked the car! That's the only thing you have to say? Nothing for me? I could've died! It will cost you so much. My neck and body hurts. -Help him! -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. -Hi. Look at that car... It will be so expensive to fix. Hi. -Strange. -In which way? I don't know, he's strange, nervous, angry, grumpy. He talks bad to people. You know Fernando is a reasonable person. But after what happened, he wanted to keep working. He didn't want to return with me. -On top of that, his ring was stolen. -What ring? -His wedding ring? -Yes. -Just that? -Yes. -Not his wallet or his cell phone? -No. -Pau... -What? I don't know, maybe he has another woman in Buenos Aires, or something. What are you saying, Maru? Well, it's more common than you think. -Common? -That's right. How many days a week he's there alone? He could have so many opportunities. Am I wrong? How many years did he spend traveling like that? -Nine. -Well, ask him. -What am I going to say? -You say him this: "Fernando, do you have a woman in Buenos Aires?" And then he will lie because all do the same, but at least you'll notice because it's evident when a man lie. THURSDAY I picked up Gasti and then I left the car with the mechanic. Everything's fine. Yes, darling, I love you, I'll call you later. Kisses. How are you? Do you want some coffee? Okay. What's up? I have to leave my home. Jime told me she spoke with her psychologist -and we have to take some time apart. -Didn't I tell you? You never go to her psychologist, you'll always lose. -I can't stop thinking about it. -Take it easy, maybe it's not definite. I can't stop thinking about you. -My mind was blown. -Lower your voice. I can't wrap my head around it, how is it that you have two families? Explain it! -Do you want me to lend you my apartment? -Do you have another apartment? I have an apartment here, the one I use always. Of course, it's the one you use with the other. Can I ask you a favor? Don't say "the other", her name is Paula and she's my wife, okay? Norma comes to clean the apartment every Wednesday. If you need more days, just tell me. Okay. Are you up for a beer and snacks? Not snacks, I'm watching my weight. It's a bit late to worry about your weight. Thank you for doing this for me, you're so generous for lending me your apartment, but I didn't change my mind and I feel like an hypocrite if I don't tell you. Relax, you have the right to tell me. I don't want to be your sidekick in all of this. Understand me, I don't know Paula but I do know Vera. I love her, I know her for so long and she's a good woman. You don't understand, there's a mix up. I don't have an affair. Vera and Paula are my wives, I love both of them. -Pipi! -Hi! -Did you get there all right? -Yes, I'm perfect, darling. Are you still at the hospital? No, I'm in the department drinking beer with Gonza. What about you, Pipi? I just came from the supermarket, I was missing some stuff at home. -Are you okay? -Yes, perfect. Okay, take a rest, darling. You too, Pipi, I love you. -Kisses. -Kisses. I have to tell you something about the hot water... You have two daughters, and a son here, do you have everything in duplicate? Do you have two bank accounts? So you have two medical insurances. Yes. How do you work around the taxes? You can't have all legal. Something must go under the table. Everything's legal, minor things go under the table. What about social media? It's dangerous. Do you have two Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts? Everything is double, but I left some sites. What about your sex life? What do you mean? Your sex life, I mean, when you have sex, how do you do it? My sex life is none of your business! You don't understand, it's not Vera or Paula... it's Vera and Paula, a complete happiness. When I leave Mar Del Plata to come to Buenos Aires I feel a continuous affection. I have just one big family divided in two. One big family you say? Do you listen what you're saying? Just one big family? I tried once in my life to have an affair, I talked to a girl all night to feel another scent, to feel another thing. And when I returned home, Jime said: "How was your night, darling?" I shook like a leaf. I ended in the hospital with no blood pressure! And you look so relaxed and carefree! What's you pathology? Explain it to me. My pathology? A happy man? Relax, you'll have a stroke. -Do you want some coffee? -Bring me whiskey. Are you going to mix beer with whiskey? You mix everything, but I can't mix some drinks? Bring me some whiskey. Damn. Your aunt Maru will be there to look after you. I'll be there tomorrow when I finish my course. No, I'm not angry. Not at all. I have to leave now. Bye, bye. How clever! It's not like that. Is it heavy? You can eat you dessert when you finish your dinner, not before. Okay, mom. My little boy! -Hi, darling. -Hi. -Who wants some chicken? -Me! I want to eat this chicken leg! I'm not a chicken, Dad! I want to grab the hose from the gas dispenser and spray it all over me and burn myself right now. Paula, please, come back! I can't do it. Tell me where you are. In a gas station bar, I told you already! Stay there, I'll pick you up. No, I have to face this. Face what? What are you going to do? I don't know, I'll call you later, I need some time to think. -Don't hang up! -I'll cal you later, Maru. I need some time to think. Think about your daughters, don't do anything crazy. What about me? Who thinks about me? Let's take you to school. Very well. Behave yourself. -Bye, darling. -Bye, darling. Bye! Bye, Gasti! What did you forget, Fernando Ferro? Yes? I'm Fernando's wife. We've been 19 years together. These are our daughters. Cancun. Last year. I don't feel good. I need to sit down. Do you feel better? Okay. Please, explain me what's all this madness. You are the one who has to explain. You are my husband's lover. Listen, what's your name? -Paula. And you? -Vera. Listen, Paula, I live in this house with Fernando. We've been here for nine years. We have a son, Gastón. He's six years old. I've been married to Fernando for 19 years! We had a civil ceremony and a church wedding. We have two daughters, Sofia and Josefina. They are 14 and 16 years old. What did he tell you? That he was single, divorced? Widower. You drowned two years after you married. What about his trips to Mar Del Plata all weeks? That the public hospital was his first job and he wouldn't quit for the honor. -Yes, that's true. -No, it can't be true. -Yes, it is. -It can't be true. -Yes, it's true! -Not that, this! This can't be true! Okay... How can you prove you're not a psycho from Mar Del Plata that organized all this because you're obsessed with my husband? What happened? Did he treat you? Are you one of his patients? Did you have an affair, some crazy love and you fell in love of the orthopedic surgeon like an idiot? That was it? No! I'm Fernando's wife, we've been together for 19 years! The last thing I need is that you call me an idiot, after all I saw! I spent all night looking through your window how my husband had another family. I've never felt so humiliated. So don't disrespect me! For what it's worth, that son of a bitch was with me before being with you! Let's make that clear. -Look, Paola... -Paula! Okay, Paula, I'm not feeling well right now. How do you think I feel? I'm not okay, because I'm feeling an inner fire that is growing and announces a violent attack that can't be stopped. I could hurt you, Paula. So I'll ask you, for your safety and mine, that you leave my house now. Leave my house, now! Out! Out! I'm not a psycho from Mar Del Plata, I'm an idiot that was blind for years! Leave! Come to Mar Del Plata to clear your doubts! Leave now! Wait! Take my number and send me a text with yours. Will you come to Mar Del Plata? So you can see I'm saying the truth. You don't believe I'll take your word for it. Take my number. Yes, 11-4-57-21-22. -Listen carefully. -22? Yes. Don't confront him, don't say anything until I go there and check that it's true what you told me. Are you asking me to be quiet after all I saw last night? -Yes. Yes. -And don't say anything? Because if it's true, both of us are victims of that piece of shit. The fact that he was with you 19 years and nine with me makes no difference. This is not a quantitative matter, it's rather a qualitative one. Okay. But try to go this Sunday when he returns because I couldn't hold myself any longer to grab his neck and force him to speak. I am... I don't know how I am. SUNDAY Your taxi is here, Fernando! I will return with two surprises, not one, okay? Give me a kiss, son, I love you. Goodbye, honey. What was that kiss? Give me a proper kiss. I love you. I'll call you later. Mommy was thirsty. Weren't you playing video games? I'll pay you as if you drove me to Mar Del Plata. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Hello! Hi. Pipi! Hi, honey. No, no, I'm so sick! I don't know if it's an allergy. -Do you have a fever? -No, I don't. How are you, honey? Fine, I don't know, I'm a little depressed. Listen, Maru and Charly are coming tonight. No, you kill me. You have to tell me in advance, Pipi! Tell you what? I drove 250 miles, I want to be with you, I feel exhausted. What do you want me to do? They invited themselves! I think they want to tell us that she finally got pregnant, poor Maru! Why are you crying, Pipi? There's nothing wrong, darling. No, no no. Everything's fine, it's all good news, we have to be happy. Make some toast, I'll take a bath and be back. Come on, lift yourself up, Pipi! Did you see these testicles? I feel like... It's German silicone, nothing is better. Stay still, Moncho! Stay still, Moncho! What's going on, sis? There's a chance Fernando has another family. What? Another family, Nacho, it's not that hard. Another woman, daughters. Yeah, I get the concept of a family. But I can't understand... Let's see, where? Where's Fernando from, Nacho? Mar Del Plata. Okay, another family in Mar Del Plata, I'm getting there. Yesterday came the woman who allegedly married him 19 years ago. Stop right there. You, me, the whole world, this two testicles, know that Fernando is a widower. -I mean... -That's what he told us. He even showed me pictures of the deceased. And the woman that came yesterday was identical. But she was breathing. She was breathing perfectly. This can't be true. He doesn't fill the profile. The ones that do these kind of things are psychopaths or badass. -What are you doing? -I have to clear my doubts. -Okay, but where? -Where's Fernando now, Nacho? Mar Del Plata. I'm getting there. It's a mentality problem. The great cancer here was the Spanish conquest. Columbus got here and brought the corruption virus and infected this land for four centuries and a half. Are we going to talk all night about the Spanish conquest? Let's get to the point, why are we reunited today? Tell us the news, come on! Yes, come on. Okay... There's two of them. Bravo! Congratulations, I'm so happy for you. -Yes. -Thanks, Fer. -This is real happiness, right? -Yes. -Real happiness. -What's up, Pipi? It's great news. It blew your mind, sis in law. Yes, you waited so many years, so many injections and treatments. She's so sensitive! Let's open a champagne bottle! Let's drink champagne. Second floor, "B". No, no, second floor, "A" because it was facing the street. It's been two years since I came, I don't remember. Okay, wait. One, two. Is that one? The lights are off, I mean... Maybe he went out. I'll call him, let's see what he says. Maybe you should call her instead. Call her. If it's true everything she said, she has to prove it. If she's with him, she could give him the phone. 2001 harvest. The owner of Mascardi winery gifted it to me. He's the typical crook filled with money but he's a good guy. Maybe you could be crooked and a good guy at the same time. Mom, your phone. -Can you bring us some chocolate? -Hello? It's me. Who is it? We are in front of the apartment and the lights are off. I don't think he's sleeping because it's too early. What apartment? What are you talking about? Your apartment, in Peralta Ramos 2471, don't you live here? That bastard! He has two apartments, one there and one here! Where? In Buenos Aires, three blocks away from your home. The day of the accident I slept with him there. We were celebrating our anniversary. Even more, I saw you at the hospital but you didn't notice. Gonzalo told me you were his doctor, not his lover. He's a piece of shit! I'm not his lover. I'm his wife. His second wife, at least. Are you with him now? Yes, we are in our house. -Ask for the address. -Send me your address. Look, Paula, I traveled for three and a half hours to prove you're not crazy, send me your address. Alsina 305. Do you have a lover? -Who are you talking to? -With Guada. -Is something wrong? -No, it's nothing. Are you there, Paula? What's up, Pipi? -Calm down, Pipi! -I'm talking here! Paula! Listen carefully. Don't do anything crazy. I'm with my daughters and I want to look after them. Besides, we're celebrating that my sister got pregnant. I'll open the blinds so you can see from outside. Start the engine, Nacho. -Alsina. -305. Congratulations! I wish you the best. These are great moments in life. No! -What happened? -We're not expecting anyone. -Are you joking, Pipi? -It could be dangerous. It could be anyone. We didn't touch our drinks yet, calm down! Fer! Hello, did you park your truck in front of my driveway? -Charlie! -It was me, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. Come on, brother, I've been looking for the owner for 30 minutes! I'll move it right away, I'm so sorry. There he is. It was true. He's a real piece of shit! Where is she? Yes, call her. Hello? I see him, but not you. Come out if you're with him. I'm so happy for my sister. Pipi! You'll rip my cheek, what's up? I wanted to give you a kiss! He's a son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! -I'll kill him! -Psycho bastard! I'll break his neck! -No, no! -What? I'm the victim here. If someone is going to kill him, that will be me! -Start the engine, Nacho! -Okay. -Should we leave? -Start the engine, Nacho! Okay, okay. God damn it! I'm going to bed, Pipi. Lets go. No, I'm going to finish the dishes -because I don't like this mess... -Clean tomorrow. No, Fer, I'll get depressed. -Let me do it, then. -No, no! I'm sorry. No. No. What's up with you, Pipi? Nothing. Kiss me. Give me a real kiss. I'll wait for you upstairs, Pipi. I'm at a Chinese restaurant. Come or I'll go over there. I'll be there. Is it her? -Yes. -What should I do? There are 200 empty tables, Nacho, pick one. I don't have much time. He doesn't know I left. Are you afraid he thinks you're having an affair? What are you going to do with all this shit? I don't know. Get a divorce. I don't really know. I'm still shocked, I can't believe this situation. A divorce is not enough, that bastard has to pay, he really has to pay, he's a despicable human being. Yes. But what do you mean by that? Something that hurts. A lot. We could report him for being bigamous. It's a crime, I've been researching on Internet. He could go to prison for that. Would that be enough for you? I was going to enter your home to kill him. Death is not an option to me. I have children and you too. Anything but kill him. Prison is not an option to me. No. He has to suffer for the rest of his life. Big time suffering. Give me your hands. Give me your hands. We're together in this. We're related by the same tragedy. We're both victims of an horrendous psychopath and misogynous man. We could've been reincarnated two times without realizing any of this. It would've been better. I have bad news. We know it now. Now we have to make extreme justice. Now is our time. Punishment for that piece of shit! I don't know what you're thinking, but tell me before you do anything, please. I'll call you. But you have to keep acting like you don't know anything. Control your feelings, Paula. Emotions are like a rock thrown to a pond. It forms a little ripple. You know where it started but you never know where it'll end. -Open your mouth. -No, I don't take pills. Open your mouth. I'm a doctor. Do you think I want to murder you? Open your mouth. It's an anxiolytic, it works miracles. We have to keep it together, more than ever. And he doesn't have to suspect anything. When he least expect it... we fall on him like to wounded hyenas. I'm a little scared. Dignity is what you have to feel, not fear. That pill is going to help you with fear, too. Here. Keep them. I have more at home. You can take one every 12 hours. Try to eat something before.W We'll keep in touch. Let's go, Nacho. -Hi, Pipita! -Hi, Dad. Give me a kiss. Where's your mother? She left. She's acting strange. What happened? Hi! Are you done with your shift? I'm here at the apartment. How are you, honey? I'm perfect. I took the day off because Gasti made you a sculpture with egg and corn flour at school and he wants to show it to you. He says it has to be today. I don't get it, are you coming to Mar Del Plata? We passed Dolores recently. We'll stay until tomorrow, I don't want to make a long trip just to return the same day. We'll be there in less than an hour. I love the idea! Okay, I'll see you. Kisses. -Dad, you're here! -Yes, I'll be right back. -When? -In just a moment, dear! I wanted to show you something! -Hello? -We're going back. Your son started to make a tantrum, he wanted to return home. Stop it, Gasti! Stop it! Don't scold him, Vera, he's just a kid. He wants to return home, that's okay. Drive carefully, okay? Okay, kisses. Kisses. Kisses, darling, I love you. Piece of shit. How can you eat empanadas when we have lentils, I don't get it. -Thank you, darling. -No! -This is your plate. -It's the same. -How could you eat that? Gross. -It smells so good. -Try it. -I don't want to. Come on, try it. -That's gross. -Try it! I love you. There's no wine here! Do you want to drink some? -Bring one, please. -You go. Why don't you go, Dad? Easy, easy, three against one. Women took control! Womyn, Dad, womyn. It sounds like Latin. Wait a second... Did you hear that? -What's going on? -Are you okay? I feel something... Why are you...? -What's that face? Is something wrong? -No. How come? You're like-- Pipi, what's wrong? Do you love me? What kind of question is that? Of course I do. What is it? Do you still choose me? I love you with all my soul, you're one of the most important people in my life. One of them. Okay, one, because it's you, the girls... I'm shitting myself! I won't make it! -Hi? -Hello. I want to tell him the truth, I can't handle it anymore. No! Where is he? He's in the bathroom. -And you? -In my bed. Get up. Get away from him or else you'll talk. Take some distance from that idea. Take your dog for a walk. We don't have a dog! Take a walk without a dog, or water your plants. Do something to get distracted and avoid thinking. Promise me you won't talk. You'll ruin our opportunity to take revenge like we deserve. -I'm going to clean the pool. -Perfect. Where are you going, Pipi? -To clean the pool! -Now? Come on! SATURDAY Idiot! -Sorry, sorry. -Watch out. It's nothing, relax. That piece looks great! Do you want some? Vera... What's going on? What? Don't you want some? I was sleeping. Keep sleeping, I'll wake you up. What was that? Sorry. I got excited. Be gentle, darling, I have only one. -Hello. -Is he there already? No, not yet. Cancel all your plans for Thursday afternoon. Why? What's happening on Thursday? He's going to come back, Paula, like every Thursday. Does he always leave from your home? Yes, but sometimes he leaves from the hospital, it depends. It's important that you know it. We need precision. I don't know, I'll tell you this Thursday. But why? Did you have an idea? Yes, but I can't tell you now. Remember I told you... That death is not an option, yes, don't worry. He'll live, to realize he's dead. This idea you have, is going to happen this Thursday? No, this Thursday we're going to collect data to make the plan. We're going to follow him to Buenos Aires. Are you going to come here? Yes. We have to know what's going on from when he leaves until he arrives here. What could it be? Nothing. He just drives. You think so? What kind of car does he use? -A Suran. -That's curious. Here he has an Honda truck. He has to make the change somewhere, Paula. How can he be so crazy and I didn't realize it? Don't worry, I didn't realize either, you're not the only idiot. I'll be there Thursday. I'll call as soon as I arrive. Cancel all your plans between 1 and 9 p.m. And relax, or else take a pill every 12 hours. THURSDAY You drove four hours to get here and now you'll drive four hours to return. I came by plane, Paulita. I rented a car at the airport and I'll return it once we get to Buenos Aires. Your idea is tremendous, Vera. Any woman in a situation like this would think about it right away. -Am I wrong? -No. But one thing is thinking about it and another one is doing it. We won't be the first ones to do it, nor the last ones. Look at him. He's happy, that son of a bitch. Why do you say that? He's singing, look how he moves his head. Sing, piece of shit, sing! You'll be crying soon! He always brings croissants from this place. Not for me, I don't eat starchy foods. So why would he come here? He must make the switch here. What is he doing? He stops being your husband to become mine. How are you, dude? Do you want me to wash your ship? Okay, but change that cloth, you made a scratch last time. That guy that washes his car could be useful. Look how relaxed he is, psycho son of a bitch. He's very sick. I can't believe it. That pathology is called "son of a bitch". We have everything we need, now we have to think, plan and execute. Next Thursday will be D-day. Listen... What if he fell in love with both of us? There's a reality show about a guy that has four wives. Polygamy is accepted in Algeria, Cameroon and Pakistan. I love it, it's great! So now we'll move the three of us to Pakistan, I love it. Come on... Stop joking, Paula. D-DAY I'll call you when I arrive, Pipi, I'll be back on Sunday. -I love you. -Drive carefully. As usual. Bye, darling. -Hello. -He left. Great. Where are you? Where are you? Yes. I'm on my way. The first phase of the plan was to catch him. The day before, Vera went to the place of the ambush to plant the first obstacle. The plan required a tow truck. It's for a movie. We need it in Atalaya, just for a day. Nacho hired the guy that would play as the mechanic. Verita, I'm with Bagre. I'm so scared. Listen to me, he asks for 15 thousand or no way. What do we do? We also needed burundanga. Vera handled that. Take good care, queen. Julito, you're an angel. It's scopolamine. It's used for dizziness. I'm in Dolores. Thursday morning, Vera and Nacho were in Atalaya to cover the tow truck with the right logos. -Nacho, it looks awful! -Inhale... Inhale... They've also installed two cameras to visually follow the plan. He's in the U- turn. We see him. Follow him, you'll see a building with colors, animals and plants. We're in a veterinary ambulance next to a tow truck. He's a bastard son of a bitch. You scared me! -Are you okay? -I took all the pills you gave me. I think they are acting now. -How many did you take? -How are you? -How many did you take, Paula? -Two, three, four... My man! What happened? The tires are flat! Not just that, someone pierced them. Look at that, they're perforated. -Where? -Here, and there, too. Where? You said you were going to take care of him! It's all in the plan! Relax. -You're done, man. -Did you see who did it? How could I? I was working. How could this happen? I'll have to call a tow truck. Of course, you only have one tire to change. -He's calling the tow truck. -Yes. -And it will arrive! -Never before ours, obviously. -Open the window, Paola. -Paula is my name! Sorry, sorry. Bagre, Bagre! Are you dumb? Wake up! You go in five. -Nacho, your voice. -Sorry. Amatista, it's your turn. Who's Amatista? Her. My astrologist. She'll apply the burundanga and distract the washing guy. I saved her life pumping her stomach when she took a jar of pills after she learned that her husband was cheating on her. Because the world is full of sons of bitches. When she woke up after her coma, she said she owed me one and now we're even. Amatista is entering the scene. -Hello. -Are you washing now, darling? Yes, ma'am, 200 pesos. That's expensive. How come? I'll wax it even. Okay, I'll leave it in front of the restaurant. Okay, I'll be there. Come on! I'm at the parking lot in Atalaya. Next to a red Honda. You'll see me. How long will it take? Hurry up, please. He's calling. It's him. Hi, darling! Hi, darling, you won't believe it. I've punctured a tire. And the auxiliary tire is flat. I've called a tow truck. What a shame! I'm so mad right now. Where are you? On the road near Chascomús. Okay, be patient. Just relax. Relax, I'll see you tonight. I'm going to see my mom. -Okay, darling, see you there. I love you. -Kisses, kisses! -Did you hung up, sis? -Yes. Okay, this is the hard part. Amatista and Bagre have to meet here. Paula. Bagre, now! Amatista, it's your second entrance. Remember what I've told you, don't breath in while you handle it. How is she going to apply the burundanga? She's going to put it in his phone. I'm sorry to bother you. My phone died and I forgot my charger, and my license, too. I'm a real mess! I wanted to ask you if you could lend me your phone, just a second. So I can call my husband to bring it to me. I don't understand... Could you lend me your phone? Yes, no problem. -Just a second. -Here you go. Thank you, honey. No! It's his tow truck! What number do you have? -23098. -I have the same one. Bagre, my love, think of something. -These guys are such a mess! -Always the same thing! Let's do this, I'll take care of it. Are you sure? -Yes, you can go. -Okay! -See you later! -Bye! I love him! Check the Grey furniture or the tiny table at the hall. Okay, can you bring it to me? Here! Here! In Atalaya. Excuse me? Look, Coco, take the dirty pajamas that you have, put on something decent and bring that now! I forget everything because I'm the only one that does something at home! You just hang out all day drinking mate scratching your ass! -What happened? -Both tires are punctured. How can someone be so mean? Look at that! And the other one, too. Thank you. No problem. Everything's fine with your husband? Yes, as good as it gets, he's so sweet. Take care of yourself, honey. This is going perfect. -You hate him. -Don't you? Sister, your turn. The only thing I can do now is tow your truck to a tire shop so you can buy a new one. Or maybe two. Such meanness. -Your phone is ringing. -Yes, thanks. Hello? Hi darling, everything's fine? I started to worry. Did the tow truck arrive? He just got here, he'll take me to a tire shop to buy a new one, darling. Don't worry, relax. Don't stress out. Breath in... Yeah, breath in... I'm so annoyed right now. I'll try to think it's a joke, otherwise... I would pick you up, but I have to see my mother now. You're so sweet. Relax. I'll be there in a couple of hours. -Kisses. -I love you. It's done! -Is he under the effect? -Yes. What happened, man? Did your blood pressure drop? Are you okay? I'm panicking. I'm about to regret this. Paula, if you're going to quit, do it now. This is your last chance. -No, what? -No, no, that... Yes, let's do it. Fantastic, Paula. You did it great! Fer... He looks like a zombie. Don't feel pity for him, Paula. Did you forget what he did? I'm so annoyed by your fish memory. Stop offending me, Vera! Tell me I'm a lazy fat now. What's up, can't you talk now? Little scum. Leave him alone! Calm down, Pauli, I'm checking if the burundanga made its effect. Hurry up, Nacho. Yes, let's go. Bagre, bring the cage. Let's go in three, two, one. He's so heavy! Bagre, here's the rest. You were awesome. -Bye, good luck. -Nacho, just leave us in your shop. Fer... why, Fer? You do what I say, Nacho, let's go! Let's go, Paula. Come on, let's move! He's waking up. What's going on? Are you surprised to see us together? How could you do something like this, Fernando? How could you? I was loyal to you for 19 years that we were married! And I had a thousand chances not to do it! Don't cry, Paula, don't lower yourself. -Let me explain it. -No, I want to talk to him! You don't have an idea how many parents tried to seduce me at the kindergarten! Hundreds of them! Thousands of them! But I didn't do a thing. I've always looked to the other side. I told myself: "How could I do this?" "He works all day, traveling to pay our mortgage." And you had another family! Son of a bitch! I don't have another family, this is... This is like... I can't talk like this. Please, untie me. You can't talk because you're under the effect of burundanga. What did you...? What did you gave me? Burundanga? What are you going to do to me? We're going to practice a little surgical intervention. Are you crazy? Have you all gone crazy? No... No, you can't do me that! What? What are you thinking? Your penis? No, we'll leave your penis, because if we remove your penis, you wouldn't be able to pee and then you'll die, and we don't want you to die. No, no. We want you to live, live to suffer at least a small part of what you made us suffer. So we'll leave your penis. But your testicles, in the other hand... Are you...? You've gone crazy. This is illegal, you're going to end in prison. Vera! Vera! You're not like this. Paula... Pipi, you're not like this. Think about our girls. Did you think about them when you did this? Local anesthetic. It will be just a sting. -No! -Open your legs. Grab his legs, Paula! Don't shout, Vera! How can you cut my testicles off! -Look at me, darling. -Don't let him convince you! -No... -Open your legs! Open! Open or else I'll inject it in your testicles and you won't like it. Help! Help! Help me! Okay. Complete anesthetic. Grab something to cut his shorts. Paula, this is madness. You're not like this. I love you, it's me. Paula, please. What did you do, idiot! You won't do it! You've gone crazy! Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! Stop it! This is a nightmare! Who are you threatening, Paula? I don't get it. Stay still! Stay still, or else... What have you become? You're crazy! He's escaping! He blocked it with something! Push, Paula! Where is he? The rooftop! Vera! If he escapes we'll end up in jail! He won't escape! -There he is. -Fer! Stop right there! One more step and I'll jump! You've gone completely crazy, you wanted to castrate me! -I'm the one who's crazy? -This was your idea, right? Did you arrange all this? Do you hate me, Vera? You are the one who hates us. You ruined our lives, Fernando! I love you! Not anyone would've done what I did. No, only a sick bastard like you could've done something like this. I don't get you, Fernando! What is it that you don't get, Pipi? This is me. I love this way. I live this way, I was born like this! No one is born that way. When did you become this person? It's true, I lied. It's true. But you wouldn't understand. It took some time for me to get it. Many people have my condition. And not only here, in other places of the world, too! This is a moral scam of huge proportions! Here and everywhere in this planet, Fernando. That's the issue! Morals, damn morals! Who said you can't love two people at the same time? Anyone that's decent and honest, like me! Like us! Stop this joke. How many women do you have? How many children? How many did you scam? Don't disrespect me. I love you both deeply. I never cheated on you, you're the love of my life. If one of you disappeared, I'd die. You're sacred to me, how many times I told you I love you? -Didn't he tell you that? -Paula! I love you so much, so much, that I'm willing to forgive you for what you tried to do. It's over! This is over! Let's turn this page. The cards have been dealt. We can do it, we can try it. You're a sick psychopath. If I can't be with you two, I'll jump. Do it! -I'll jump! -Do it! Coward! You won't do it, you came here to escape, not to kill yourself. Tell us the truth, Fernando, once in your life, do it! We have an extraordinary opportunity. There's people that break up because there's lack of love! Here, the love exceeds! And I wonder, are we going to let this love die? Bravo, bravo! Bravo, bravo! He fell! Fernando! This is me. I seem to be like everyone else. However there's something that makes me different. My heart is too big. My heart is able to love more than anyone else's. Seven months later, my reality had completely changed. I never lost hope for them to realize how much I loved them. And I still do. But there was no chance. None of them knew who I really was. -Hello! -Hi. Hi! We played three matches in the video games and he won every time. -Nice! -Bye, champ. -I love you, son. -Me too. -Hi, honey. -Hello. -Bye, Gasti. -Bye, loser! I'll pick him up this Saturday. He has a birthday party. Bye, Vera. Piece of shit. Here is some chocolate. I think it's dad. -Hi! -Hi, darling. Are you better? I don't feel like dancing, but I'm okay. It's great to see you here. I couldn't miss it. -Hi. -Hi, Paula. Jose. It's your dad, come here. Hi, darling, happy birthday. Hi. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll stay for a little while then I'll go. Okay. I'd like to talk to you some time. -No, Fer. -But not here. We better not. Go with your daughter, she needs you. I lost a lot of things. The most important ones. I lost them. I was punished for loving too much. -You wanted a latte, right? -Yes, thanks. They say true love comes once in a lifetime. For me it was twice and maybe it won't happen ever again. Nobody understands my heart. No wonder it's called a dumb organ. Even though you don't want to, it keeps on beating, unwillingly. Like it's dumb... or crazy.
