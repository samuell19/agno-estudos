Philadelphia's number one talk radio station, it's The Dr. Liz Show, heard every weeknight from 8 to 10. Here's your host, Dr. Liz Manners. - Good evening, everyone, I'm Dr. Liz. Welcome to the show. Tonight we're gonna be talking about co-dependent relationships, those that are destructive but often difficult to leave. So if this sounds like you, please give me a call. The phone lines are open. - Yes, it's very pretty. - What about these ones here? - That one. - Of course. So what is it this time? Can't be her birthday, that was last month. - It's the 5th anniversary of the day we met. - The day you met? That's so sweet. - Actually, it's not until tomorrow, but I cut my trip short so I could come back early and surprise her. - If you try to control him, you'll only end up pushing him farther away. - [Caller]: Yeah, but if it wasn't for me, nothing would ever get done around here. He needs me to tell him what to do! - It's perfect. Can you gift-wrap this? - Certainly. - Nancy, you need to give your husband some space to be his own person. - [Nancy]: I give him space! I mean, I barely even see him. He gets home late during the week, he spends all of his time with his friends... - Well, maybe that's because you're driving him away. Nancy, I know this might not be easy to hear, but if you wanna see more of your husband, you need to spend less time bossing him around and more time telling him how much you appreciate him. - [Nancy]: I'll give it a try, then. I'm not sure it'll work. - Good luck, Nancy. I'm Dr. Liz Manners and I'll be right back after the break. Thanks for waiting. - [Phone]: Sorry for keeping you waiting, Christine. It shouldn't be too much longer. - Ha! Ha! Ha! - [Phone]: Christine, are you still there? - Yes. - Please, just hold on, you're the next caller. - [Radio]: ...clouds are expected to move in tomorrow night and there's a 40% chance of showers by Thursday morning, but the weekend is shaping up to be much... - Come on, please. [ Dialling ] [ Busy signal ] - Who are you talking to? - Liz, it's Christine. - And we're back. I'm Dr. Liz Manners and we're on with Christine. Christine, thank you for calling tonight. How are things, any better? - No. Things aren't gonna get any better, Dr. Liz, and believe me, I've tried. He says he loves me. In his own way, I know that he does. He does things for me, he buys me things, but... - [Liz]: But what? - I don't talk to anybody anymore. He slowly drove everyone out of my life. He took away my money, my credit cards... Last week, he even sold my car. I don't even care, because I have nowhere to go. If he knew I was talking to you right now, he'd kill me. - Christine, listen: This is getting worse and worse. You need to get away from him. - I know, but I tried to get away. I tried and he found me. - [Liz]: There are places that you can go, safehouses where he will never find you, and I can give you the number during the break. - You don't understand. He told me. He said, "There's nowhere on God's green earth you can hide." - You have to get away from him. Your life could be in danger. [ Sigh ] - Dr. Liz, I can't. - This is how he controls you. He's convinced you that you are helpless without him. - I know. I know I am helpless, but... I don't wanna be anymore. - [Liz]: Christine, you can get away from him tonight and never see him again. Will you let me help you? - Okay. Okay. - Sarah Jane, what are you doing? You're talking to that woman on the radio. Dr. Liz whatever her name is. - Christine, are you there? [ Hang-up tone ] - We lost her. - Okay, well, uh, Christine must've hung up, so Christine, if you're listening, please call us back. - How could you do this to me? You were gonna leave me. - No. - Ha! Look at this, I come home early to surprise you, I get you a special gift, I get you flowers, and what do I get? You talking on the phone, telling people how badly I treat you, what terrible things I do. - I... I just needed somebody to talk to. - I'm the one you talk to!!! I have never loved anyone as much as I love you, Sarah Jane. I think about you every minute and every day. Trying to find ways to make you happy. You can't leave. You know that doesn't work, you've tried it before. Ha. You have been drinking. - Kyle... - I can't trust you anymore. I'm gonna have to take the phone away too. I love you, Sarah Jane. Why do you try to hurt me, huh? - Kyle, I can't... - You can't what? You can't what?!? - I can't do this anymo-- - Oh, you think you can make it on your own out there, huh? You wouldn't make it for 2 min! Do you know how many women would love to have what you have? A man who would do anything for her? Do you? I mean, do you?!? No. No, you don't. You don't appreciate anything. You're nothing but an ungrateful little bitch. This is the last draw, Sarah Jane. I work my ass off for that woman. I told you, I don't want you using the phone when I'm not around. Now I'm gonna have to be here all the time so that you don't do something stupid. Sarah Jane, come here. Are you listening to me? Sarah Jane! Sarah Jane! You come back here! Sarah Jane! Sarah Jane! [ Phone ringing ] [ Gasp ] [ Screeching ] [ Horn ] [ Bang! ] Oh no... - Oh my God... She just ran right out in front of me, I didn't even see her! I'll call 911. - No... Oh no... Sarah Jane... Oh God... Oh God... [ Footsteps ] - Ah, sleeping beauty finally awakes! - Hmm! Hmm! I was so tired last night I forgot to ask how your meeting went yesterday. - Oh, good, good. These... these guys seem really interested in working with me. - That's great. So we're going out with one of your investors tonight, right? - Yeah, I told him to make a 6 o'clock reservation, so you have plenty of time to get to the station. - Thank you. Oh! By the way, have you seen this? They're saying that we missed a bunch of payments on our homeowners' insurance. - Ah, that's gotta be some kind of mistake. I'll call 'em today and take care of it. And don't worry about that other stuff, honey, I'll deal with it later. - Okay. Well, I better take a shower. [ Sigh ] [ Car engine starts ] Oh, hi, yes. Um, I have a question about a charge on my credit card statement. - [On the phone]: What's the date? - The 22nd. It's a restaurant charge for Chez Maurice. I've never been there. - And do you share this with your husband? - Yes, it's a joint card. - Well, perhaps he charged it. - No, my husband was out of town that day. - It looks like it came from his card. - Well, could you check his signature? Maybe somebody stole his card and he didn't realize it. - Is this the only questionable charge on the bill? - Um... yes, that's the only charge I don't recognize. - Well, let me put you through to our fraud investigation department. - Fraud investigation department? Um, no, that's okay. I'm on my way out. - Let us know if we can help. - Thank you. - Bye, now. - Bye. - As you know, Hope Sanctuary is bursting at the seams. We're constantly having to turn women away. - How soon can we get the 2 new sites up and running? - Well, that depends on how fast we can raise enough capital to complete the acquisitions and then do the renovations. - So tell us straight: How much money do we need? - Three hundred thousands. - Pffew! - Oh! Well, I'll start making calls this evening. - Me too. Well, I guess we have our marching orders. - Devon, I didn't get a chance to congratulate you on the Frankel case. Were you confident they'd acquit her? - Honestly, you never know what the jury's going to do with a self-defence case, especially when the victim's high-profile, but in the end, they did the right thing. Can I offer anyone a coffee before you go? - That'd be great. - Uh, we'll join you in a moment, okay? - Sure. - So, are you going to tell me what's eating you or what? - Kate, I really don't wanna talk about it. - Can't fool me, Liz. I haven't seen you act like this since you thought you failed your MCATs. Come on, talk to me. [ Sigh ] - Rob's been different, lately. - Yeah? In what way? - It's hard to articulate exactly. I mean, I know he works really hard and his mind's on the business, but it's the, uh... the little things, you know? He's starting to come home late and... he drinks more than he used to... He just seems distant. I mean, he's still affectionate, but we don't really... he doesn't initiate... - Intimacy? - Yeah. It's like he avoids it. And then this morning, I found a charge on his credit card. It was for a dinner at a downtown restaurant when he was supposed to be in Boston. - And you think these are all signs that he's having an affair. Well, you already know what my advice would be. - Just come right out and ask him. - You got it. - [Recording, Liz]: So how was your day? - [Rob]: Can't complain. I had a great meeting with a potential investor, James Stratton. He's really interested in the South African deal. - [Liz]: Oh, that is wonderful! I thought you were gonna call me tonight. - [Rob]: About what? - [Liz]: Dinner, after the show. - [Rob]: Oh. Damn, I forgot, honey. I'm sorry. I was on the phone with Mike for 2 hours. - [Liz]: I guess that's why you didn't pick up when I called. - [Rob]: Yeah, well, we were having a pretty heated discussion about my deductions. - [Liz]: Seems like we hardly ever see each other anymore. [ Snapping pictures ] - The light is perfect. [ Snaps a picture ] What's wrong? You used to love having your picture taken. - I'm okay, Kyle, I'm just a little tired. - Do you realize how beautiful you are? Don't look down. You'll be even more beautiful on our wedding day. Don't move. That's it. [ Snaps pictures ] Oh, very good. [ Snapping pictures ] Ah! Ah! You have ruined too many lives, Dr. Manners. Somebody should have stopped you a long time ago. - So, what's this guy's background? - He's loaded, he likes high-risk, high-yield investments. Anyway, he seems very interested. - That's great. - Is something wrong? - No. No, I'm fine. So, um, how'd you 2 meet? - He must've known someone at the bank who knew someone and referred him to me. Liz, there's something wrong, I can tell. - We'll talk about it later. [ Sigh ] [ Dialling ] [ Phone ringing ] Is that him? - No, somebody else. [ Hang-up tone ] [ Beep! ] There he is now. - Rob, I'm sorry I'm late. - Oh, no problem. James, this is my wife, Liz. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Oh, the pleasure's all mine. - Anyway, I would feel comfortable telling my grandmother to invest in this. - Ha! Ha! Rob, you didn't tell me your wife was Dr. Liz Manners. You're married to a real-life celebrity. - Oh! - No, really, I've listened to your show. I think it's wonderful how you've dedicated your life to helping people. - Well, thank you. That's very nice of you to say. - Oh, she's definitely dedicated her life to it. - Tell me, how do you do it? I mean, you have such responsibility, such influence. I'd be worried I'd tell them the wrong thing. - Oh, I... I think about that all the time, but you know, the people that call my show or read my books, they already have the means to help themselves, they just need someone to reaffirm what they already know. - I think you're being modest. - Ha! - I hear you're also supporting a shelter. You mentioned it on your show. - Yes. It's a non-profit that provides safe and secret housing for battered women. - Really? - Yeah, Liz was one of the founders. Now she sits on the board. She... basically runs her support campaign every year. - I try. This year, we're in a bit of a financial crunch. We need to expand but, as you can imagine, it's expensive. - Sounds like a worthy cause. Maybe I could help. - Wow! That would be wonderful. - Well, we'll talk about that more later. [ Phone ringing ] I'm sorry, I thought I saw someone I knew. I'm sorry. [ Phone ringing ] Please excuse me. - Hmm. - What's wrong? - We're supposed to be getting him to invest his money, not give it all away to your charity. - What? That is ridiculous! - Now, wherever we go, all I hear is Dr. Liz this, Dr. Liz that, Dr. Liz's charity... - I cannot believe how self-centred you are! This dinner has been about you the entire night. - Apparently not. You 2 haven't taken your eyes off each other the whole time. - Ha! You can't be serious... - No, but you have so much responsibility, so much influence... - You're jealous. - There's been a family emergency. My sister's son has been in an accident. - My God! - Oh my God! - I need to head over to the hospital. I've already taken care of the cheque. Please forgive me. - Of course! - No, no, no, thanks for dinner. Look, I'm sorry about your nephew. - Rob, I'll call you tomorrow. And Liz, I would love to talk to you some time about your charity. - Oh... I have to get to the radio station. - I'll get your coat. - Hi. I'll be there in about 15 min. - Now who are you talking to? - See you soon. - There you go, sir. Have a good night. [ Tire screech ] [ Tire screech ] [ Bzzz! ] - Your drink, darling. - Thank you. [ Sigh ] - Do you know how amazing you are? - Hmm! - What were you thinking about? - Nothing. When do you leave for Atlanta? - Not till next Friday. I have some... engagements scheduled here in Philadelphia this week. - Hmm. - Why? Are you gonna miss me? - Hmm! - Well, you know I'm gonna miss you. - Oh, I'm sure you don't have any trouble finding male companions. - I needn't try. But why would I want them when I got you? - You know what I'll actually miss? - What's that, sugar? - Hmm! I'll miss talking with you. I wish I could say the things to my wife that I can say to you. [ The engine stutters. ] - Ha! Ha! Ha! Might be a spark plug. Just a guess. - Rob? - Hi, honey. Hi. - What time is it? - It's, uh, after 1. Sorry I'm late, the, uh, truck died, and I had to have it towed. - Where were you tonight? - Nowhere, just, uh... just at the office, finishing some stuff up. - I called your cell. - Yeah, the... the battery died. - I tried you at the office, too. - I... I'm sorry, honey. Erica always transfers the calls to voicemail, you know that. [ Sigh ] What? You don't believe me? - No, I don't think I do. - Honey, look, I'm sorry about what I said at dinner tonight. - I need to ask you something and I need you to be honest with me. - Of course. - Are you having an affair? - What? What are you talking about? Why would you ask me such a thing? - Oh, come on, Rob, don't lie to me. Were you with another woman tonight? - No. Look, I told you, I... I was at the office, finishing some stuff up. - Look me in the face, Rob. Oh my God. You are. - Liz. Liz, Liz, look, please... - Don't. - Let's just ta... Let's just... Let's just talk this out. - How could you do this? - I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. - You never meant to hurt me? Who is she? - She's nobody. She's nobody important. - Were you with her last month when you told me you were in Boston? [Sobbing]: Why? - I don't know. - You don't know? - No. I don't know why. I don't have an excuse, but I swear to God, I never wanted to hurt you. - Hurt me. Didn't you think that sleeping with another woman would hurt me? - Oh, Liz... I'm sorry, I swear to God. You know how much I love you. - You have a fine way of showing it, Rob. I think you better leave. - Liz, please... - Stop. - I'll... I'll s... I'll sleep on the sofa tonight, okay? Okay? - Just go, Rob. Please. - I'm sorry. [ Beep! Beep! ] [ Car engine starts ] [ The car leaves. ] - Beautiful. - [TV]: A 9-year-old girl is still missing, 2 days after she failed... - [Recording, Rob]: I don't have an excuse, but I swear to God, I never wanted to hurt you. - [Liz]: Hurt me. Didn't you think that sleeping with another woman would hurt me? - [Rob]: Oh, Liz... I'm sorry, I swear to God. You know how much I love you. - [Liz]: You have a fine way of showing it, Rob. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? - Liz? It's James Stratton, from last night. - Oh, hi, James. - You all right? You sound like, uh... I don't know, something's wrong. - Uh, no, I'm fine. You trying to reach Rob? - Actually, no, I was trying to find out if we could get together later on today and talk about your charity. I have some associates who might be interested in making some contributions, but I'll need to know more. - Oh, that would be wonderful, but, um... today's not good. - How about tomorrow? We could meet for coffee. - Sure, tha... that would be fine. - Good. How about 10 o'clock at that café near 29th and Teak? - Okay. I'll see you there. - Great. Bye. - Bye. [ Doorbell ] [ Doorbell ] - Rob? Sweetie, you don't look so good. What happened? - We need to talk. - Hey, what's wrong? - No, no, I can't. - What do you mean? - I'm... I'm sorry, Ashley, I... I can't see you anymore. - Just like that, it's over? Why? - I told my wife about us last night. - Now why would you go and do a thing like that? - Because she asked me questions, so I told her the truth. - So? - So she kicked me out of the house. Look, I love her, Ashley, I... I want her back. I mean, can't you possibly understand that? - So, that's it, you're dumping me? What if she doesn't even want you back? - That's a chance I'm willing to take. - Get the hell out of my house. - Look, I didn't want it to en-- - Go! - Alright. - [Liz]: Look, her husband was a monster, Rob. He put her in the hospital 4 times. - [Rob]: Yeah, but if this Teresa Frankel was responsible for his death, Liz-- - [Liz]: Look, I don't condone what she did, but, I mean, she probably saved her own life by not calling the paramedics when he fell. [ Sigh ] - [Rob]: Look, I... I realize this isn't easy. I mean, you have to do what you think is right. - [Liz]: Yeah, I know. - Toby Nederman, meet Dr. Liz Manners. [ Phone ringing ] - [Liz]: This is Liz, please leave a message. [ Beep! ] - Liz, it's me. It's about 2:30. Look, I... I tried to call you earlier at home and now you're not answering your cell phone. Look, we need to talk. Liz, please, just... just call me. - This is WLOR talk radio, with more of Dr. Liz. - This is The Dr. Liz Show and we're back with Jenny. Jenny, how can I help you? - Hi, Dr. Liz. Well, I've been seeing this really great guy, but today he came over and told me he doesn't wanna be with me anymore, he wanted to be with his wife. - Jenny, what are you doing sleeping with a married man? Or didn't he tell you that he was married? - Oh no, I knew the whole time, but, well, see, his wife, she's just into herself and her career. - Well, she is his wife, and her career is none of your business. - But I love him, Dr. Liz. And I've decided to make Rob my business whether you like it or not. - Who is this? - Ozzy, cut the feed. - Got it. - I'm the woman your husband spends his lonely nights with, you self-centred bitch. [ Beep! ] - Hmm, it's good work. - And now, here's our eye in the sky, Richard Wind. - Don't worry, Liz, the last part didn't air. - I, uh... I just need a minute, Dinah. - Of course. - Where's the rest? - What do you mean, the rest? - When I wanted to bail out of this 2 week ago you said you would make it worth my while to finish it out. This is not worth my while. I want an additional 10 grand. - Ha! Ha! Ha! - Hmm! Hmm! [ Phone ringing ] - Hello. - What the hell are you doing? How could you bring that psychopath into our lives? - Liz... Liz, calm... calm down. I've no idea what you're talking about. - Oh! You know damn well! Your little girlfriend, she just called the show and tried to humiliate me on the air. - Liz, look, I'm... I'm sorry. I had no idea she would do that. - Well, Rob, you have no idea how angry I am at you! - Liz, honey, just listen to me, okay? I... I can explain this whole thing. - No! Rob, you listen to me: We are over! - No, Liz, wait. Liz... - You're a greedy little whore. Twenty thousand, that's what we agreed on and that's what you're gonna get. Your best Johns don't even pay that much! - Ah! - It's more than you deserve anyway. - I disagree. I did a little research of my own, Kyle Lundstrom. I know exactly how much you're worth. All I want is a measly 10 grand, which shouldn't be a problem for somebody who inherited his daddy's fortune. - You are making a big mistake. - I'll make this very clear: I don't know what you have against that loser and his doctor wife, but if I don't get what I want by next Friday, before I leave, I will go straight to Rob and I will tell him everything. - Okay, okay, by Friday. Are you sure that this is worth it to you? - Believe me, Kyle, it is. Ah! - Really? - Ah! [ Muffled cries ] [ Strains of effort ] - Is it worth it to you now? Is it... worth it... to you... now, Ashley? [ Sigh ] [ Doorbell ] - Who is it? - [Rob]: It's me. [ Sigh ] - Rob, what are you doing here? - You won't return my calls, the only way for me to talk to you is to come here. - I told you I didn't want to see you and you need to respect that! - Look, just hear me out, please. Look, I broke it off with Ashley, she got pissed off and she called your show. I had no idea she would do that. Look, I thought a lot about why I did it in the 1st place. And the truth is, when I'm with you, I feel like a failure. [ Sigh ] There's so much you don't understand. The business is going under. It has been for the last year. I had to let go of Erica last month. I've been sliding funds around to stay afloat, robbing Peter to pay Paul, but it's... it's all about to come crashing down. The savings is gone. There's about $13,000 left, total. - What? But I bring in more than-- - Look, it's barely enough to cover the nut. I had to take a personal loan out 6 months ago to keep from defaulting on the business loan. - What are you talking about? - We took a hit with the hedge funds. - No, they're... they're insured. - Some were. - Rob, you said-- - I had to cover the margin. - What? Why didn't you tell me sooner? - I didn't know how. - What were you thinking? We had over $200,000 in that account! - See, that's exactly why I couldn't tell you, Liz, 'cause I knew you'd get pissed off! You... you got no idea what it's like to watch your business to go down the drain! - Oh, spare me! You know, knowing you were having a tough time wouldn't have changed how I feel about you, but lying to me does. Relationships are built on trust, Rob. - Look, I know what they're built on. I didn't know how to tell you. - Oh, so that's why you started sleeping around. - You just don't get it, do you? - You know what? Actually, I do, but I resent you projecting your inadequacies on me-- - Oh, stop it, Liz! I'm not one of your damn patients! You know, you drive around in your Mercedes, doing your talk shows, writing your books and being Dr. Liz. You know what? Not everybody can be as perfect as Dr. Liz Manners! [ Beep! Beep! ] [ Car engine starts ] [ Sigh ] - [Phone]: You need to file a report, Liz. - A police report? - Yeah. - Is that really necessary? - Trust me Liz, I've been there. Divorces are messy. Just file the report in case you need it later. [ Sigh ] - I guess you're right. This is all so surreal. - Yeah, I know, but Rob obviously isn't himself lately, so protect yourself. Oh, and Liz, you may wanna change your locks. [ Sigh ] - Thank you. - Thanks. So, even with the government grants, we're $300,000 short. - Well, how does this sound for starters? - Oh... 100,000? - Ha! Ha! - Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh my gosh, that is so generous that I don't even know what to say! Um... here's the address for Devon Myers. His law firm handles all the transactions for the safehouse. He will be thrilled. - Well, you know, if you don't mind waiting a couple of days, I might know a few other people that might be interested in giving. Would you be able to meet with them if I could set something up? - Of course. - Great. I'll give you the cheque then. - Thank you. [ Laughter ] - They look happy together, don't they? - Yes, they do. - They remind me of me and my wife. - Oh, I didn't know you were married. - I'm not. I mean, not anymore. My wife passed away. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Strange, what you miss, you know? The little things: Holding hands, walking in the rain, doing the dishes together after dinner... I loved her. She was everything to me, my soul mate. Oh, I apologize. You must get sick and tired of hearing about this kind of stuff. - No, not at all. Losing someone we love is the hardest thing we ever have to deal with. Uh, may I ask how it happened? - She was murdered. She trusted the wrong person. - That's horrible. Did they find the person who did it? - No, not yet. I'm so sorry, I'm... not really comfortable talking about this. - I understand. - My life will never be the same now that she's gone. When someone you love so much is suddenly not there... you start to wonder about the purpose of your own life. - Hey, Veronica. - Hi. Oh, for you. - Where'd this come from? - It was left by the front door this morning. - Oh. "Recognize the voice? Dr. Liz Manners. Regarding the Frankel case." - I didn't know about it. Oh! - Hey, doc, that reporter's here. - Just give me a minute, Ozzy. Could you hold on, please? - [Phone]: Certainly. - Um, take him to studio B. I'll meet him there. - Okay. - Uh, yes, I think by following the advice in the book, people can find that compromise. - Hmm. The book mentions that integrity is important. You suggest that by having integrity, a person demonstrates that they're worthy of being loved. - That's right. - Do you think there's ever an occasion when it's okay to lie? - What do you mean? - I'd like to play a tape for you, Dr. Manners. - [Rob]: You're saying this Frankel woman actually confessed to you? - [Liz]: Yes. - [Rob]: What exactly did she tell you? - [Liz]: Well, I met her at the shelter and we talked a few times. Turn that off. [Liz, recording]: The last time I saw her, she told me-- - My pleasure. - And turn this off too. Where did you get that tape? - Is that your voice, Dr. Manners? - Did my husband give that to you? - I really don't think it matters where I got it. The point is I have it. - No, you illegally taped a personal conversation between my husband and me. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second there! We didn't tape anything. This cassette was given to me anonymously, and I have no proof that it was recorded illegally. Now, she told you that had she called the paramedics right away, she thinks her husband might have lived; yet you decided not to go to the police with this information. Dr. Manners, she told you everything: that they had been fighting and she may have pushed him, that he fell down the stairs but was still alive. You knew that she waited until he died before picking up the phone to call 911. - Teresa Frankel had been victimized by her husband in ways you don't even know! - She let him die. And if you had testified in court, there's no way she would have been acquitted. So basically, you helped a woman get away with killing another human being. - Neil Frankel terrorized Teresa and their children. Because he was the son of a senator, he got away with it for years. - And that's why she killed him. - Are you gonna publish what's on that tape? - That's a pretty silly question, Dr. Manners. I mean, the public is gonna eat this up. Why wouldn't I print it? - Because you'd be ruining a woman who's already endured more than any other person should have to endure. Teresa Frankel is trying to put her life back together. - Yeah, well double jeopardy prevents Teresa Frankel from being tried for her husband's murder ever again, so... - What do you want? - What I want is an exclusive interview. I want you to tell me every detail of your conversation with Teresa Frankel, or I'll publish the transcripts of this tape. - Go to hell. - Take a couple of days to think about it. I'll be in touch. Oh, and by the way, why would you think that your husband would give me a tape like that? Are you... having problems with your husband? - You okay, doc? - Oh, yeah. Thank you, Ozzy. - Your research is very thorough. I'm gonna talk to my accountant today, so you should have an answer by tomorrow. - That's great. - Ha! Rob, look, I know that this is none of my business, but I talked to Liz, and she told me about your situation. - She did? - I met with her yesterday morning to talk about the charity and it came out. She loves you, Rob. She doesn't want this marriage to end. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. The best thing for you to do is to go over there and talk to her. - Yeah, I've already tried that. - Well, you gotta keep on trying. I mean, we all make mistakes, but the biggest mistake would be letting her walk out of your life. The time is now. If you don't fight for her, you're gonna lose her forever. Trust me on this. - I guess you're right, maybe... maybe I'll go over there tonight, when she gets off work. - No maybes. You gotta do it. - Okay. I'll do it. - Ha! Ha! It's a good decision. - I am just so upset, Kate! I'm sitting in my car in the parking lot so nobody at the radio station can hear me. I've never been so angry in my life. - Oh, calm down, Liz. - I can't believe he would record us. I mean, why? Why would he do something so spiteful? - Well, maybe he was planning on a divorce and wanted to blackmail you for a settlement. He said he needs money, right? - Yeah... But this... this isn't the Rob that I know. - Yeah, well, sometimes people do crazy things when they're desperate. How you gonna handle this? - I'm not gonna handle it. From now on he can talk to my lawyer. [ Sigh ] - Okay... [ Lock turning ] [ Dialling ] [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Liz, hi, it's James. Are you at the station? - Um, actually, I was just about to leave. - Oh, I'm glad I caught you. I'm riding in the car with a colleague of mine. I've been telling him about your charity. He's very interested hearing more about it, but he's on his way to Milan tomorrow. I thought I might bring him by. - Um... do you think you could bring him by the house? - Well, uh, we're just about 15 min away from the station. - Okay, I'll wait. - Great. I'll see you in a few. - Okay. - Bye. Some people don't deserve to be happy. I'm tired of listening to your psychobabble garbage anyway. [ A car approaches. ] Impeccable timing. - Liz? Liz, honey, it's me. Liz, are you home? - She stepped out. Ha! Ha! - James, what are you doing here? - Rob, I'm sorry you had to get involved in all of this. - Where's Liz? - She was delayed a bit, but she should be back soon. You seem confused. I'll explain. Rob, I know you love Liz, even though she's an evil, hateful bitch. I loved someone too, but your wife took her away from me. Now she's gonna get a taste of her own medicine. - James, don't... don't do this. - It's too late. This plan has been in motion since the day I hired Ashley to seduce you. - You what? - And you fell for it. Unfortunately, I had to kill her. - Oh my God... - Now it's your turn. [ Raspy breathing ] - Oh yes... - Don't speak. - Yes... [ Raspy breathing ] - It'll all be over in just a minute. [ Raspy breathing ] [ Sigh ] - Rob! [ Sigh ] Rob! Oh my God! Rob! Oh! - Don't act so surprised. Another person is dead because of you. - James! - He really loved you, you know? You women, you never understand how much we love you. We give you everything, take care of you, and you just push that aside like it means nothing. - What are you doing? - Shut up! You have no idea of the suffering you've caused with your advice. Playing God, breaking up marriages and families. I'm just another one of your victims. - What did I ever do to you? - I spent weeks trying to find the perfect way to make you pay for what you did. I researched everything: your background, your habits. I even bugged your house and listened to every little spat, until I found the perfect conversation to send to our favourite journalist. Now you get to find out what it's like to have the person you love ripped away from you for no good reason at all. - Rob didn't do anything. Why did you have to kill him? - Actually, I didn't kill him, you did. - Ah! No... - And now, you're gonna kill yourself. Oh! - Ah! - You're not getting away! There's no place on God's green earth you can hide! - Help, somebody! [ Banging against the door ] Help! Please, open up! Please, call the police! [ Grunts ] [ Police radio ] - So you said he was yelling something? - Yeah. Um, he said there's nowhere that I can hide, and then, um... I got to the door and out of the house. - And that's when you ran to your neighbours'. - Yeah. - Why would this man wanna kill you and your husband? - I don't know. I guess he... had some sort of grudge against me. He said that I play God and I break up marriages and families. - You said you know this man? - Yes, he was a business associate of Rob's. I'd met him on a couple of occasions. - You said he'd already shot your husband by the time you got here. - Yes. - Found it in the cabinet in the next room. - Is this your gun? - No! - Get it to the lab. How did he get in? - I don't know. Uh, he said he had been in before. He just said he'd been listening to us for some time and that he'd made this tape and-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa: tape? - He knew about private conversations I'd had with my husband. - What else can you tell us about this guy? - Um... He had a lot of money, his wife had died and, um, he had a sister whose son was in a car accident. He drove a grey sedan. That's all I can remember. I don't even know how much of that is true. - Do you remember a license plate? - No. I didn't pay any attention. - Alright. Thanks, Dr. Manners. I think we've got enough to start off with. - Look, for the time being, is there a safe place that you can stay, with a friend, a relative? - Um, yeah, I have a place. Hope Sanctuary women's shelter. I called and they have a room. - Good. Well, we'll contact you if we have any questions. - Okay. You've got my cell number. - Look, Dr. Manners, you have my... you have my deepest sympathy. I want you to know we're gonna catch this guy. - Thank you, detective. - Please, come in. Liz, I'm so sorry about Rob. - I can't believe this is happening. Feels like a bad dream. - Please, don't worry. You can stay here as long as you want to, okay? - Thank you. [ Sobs ] [ Distant sirens ] [ Sigh ] - I just talked to Ian in forensics. - Yeah? - The gun was wiped completely clean of prints. - Figures. She said he was wearing gloves. - Right now, we don't have a trace of evidence that anyone else was in that house but her. - What about the name? James Stratton. Find anything? - I'll give you one guess. - Alright. - Good morning. - It will be once I get a cup of coffee into me. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Hi Liz, it's Dinah. Are you Okay? I'm so sorry about Rob. - Thank you. - Is there anything I can do? - Um... no, no. But I really appreciate the offer. - Look Liz, you should know there's a detective Yokum asking some questions here. - At the radio station? What kind of questions? - I don't know, lots of question, like did anybody hear you threaten Rob, things like that. They're making it sound like you're involved in this. - [Radio]: Our hearts go out to our own Dr. Liz Manners, whose husband was tragically killed last night. She's asked that we pass along her sincere appreciation for all the kind cards and e-mails that have been flooding the studio since we got word of his death early this morning. If you wish to contact Dr. Liz to offer condolences, just drop her a line here at WLO-- [ Shuts radio off ] - I'll find you. - You don't understand. This guy tried to kill me; he's gonna try again. - That's exactly why leaving the safehouse makes no sense. Let the cops do their job. - I don't think they're serious about finding James. I mean, Dinah said that they were asking questions about me. [ Sigh ] - They're just being thorough, Liz. - Oh, they're being thorough? The man who murdered my husband is out there, God knows where. Look, I'll be fine. I just need to check a few things out. Are you sure you don't remember us? I was wearing a black dress. They were in suits. He's tall with ash blond hair. - No. I'm sorry, it's just that I get so many people here in a night. - You have a surveillance camera at the front door. I saw it when I came in. Is it possible that you'd still have a tape from that night? - No, they tape over those every 24 hours. There's no reason to keep them if we haven't been robbed or anything. I'm sorry. - I understand, thank you. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? - Dr. Liz? Toby Nederman here. Look, I'm sorry to do this to you because, well, I'm sorry about your husband and all that, but I need you to make a decision about that interview. - If you had one once of compassion-- - This is business, doc. I need to strike while the iron's hot. I need that interview by tomorrow, or do I print the tape? - Do whatever you want; I'm not talking to you. [ Shuts phone off ] - I didn't hear much. I just got the sense that reporter from the Philly Star wanted to publish some tape that her husband might have given him. - Her husband? - Yeah. She was so angry. That reporter seemed like a real jerk. - Hmm. - Detective Sparks! What a surprise. - I hear you have a tape that may have something to do with the Manners case. You wouldn't be withholding evidence, now would you? - No, I was just about to call you, actually. - Sure you were. Let's go someplace so we can listen to it. - [Liz]: She didn't call the ambulance. I mean, she did, but not right away. - [Rob]: God, Liz. - [Liz]: Look, her husband was a monster, Rob. He put her in the hospital 4 times. - [Rob]: Yeah, but if this... this Teresa Frankel was responsible for his death, Liz-- - [Liz]: Look, I don't condone what she did, but, I mean, she probably saved her own life by not calling the paramedics when he fell. [ Sigh ] - [Rob]: Look, I... I realize this isn't easy. I mean, you have to do what you think is right. - Where did you get this tape? - It was left outside the door. - So she thinks her husband sent this to you? - Yeah, sure seemed like it. Ha! She about blew a gasket when I played it for her. - Are you planning on printing this? - Front page on Monday. - No. - What are you talking about? This is like manna from heaven, for both of us. - Hey, this is an open case. I'm planning on finding whoever it was that killed Rob Manners. I'm not gonna let anything, including this tape, get in the way of that. - Detective, this is the kind of story that's gonna make my career. - Toby... who was it that gave you the lead on the Ozvary killings? On the Nickelson scandal? - You did, but-- - Listen, you don't have a lot of friends in the department, and with your engaging personality and impeccable ethics, I can't imagine why, but you don't. I've gotten your back on more than one occasion; you are gonna do this for me. - Oh, come on! - I'm asking 1 week, that's all. If I don't crack the case in a week, you can have it back. But if I do make an arrest, you can have the inside track. - [Rob]: Liz-- - [Liz]: Look, I don't condone what she did, but, I mean, she probably saved her own life by not calling the paramedics when he fell. - I thought you should hear this tape, but I don't think we should jump to any conclusions. - She lied, Shannon, and it goes to motive. Her husband must have been a vindictive guy. This tape would ruin her. - We don't know if the tape came from her husband. It doesn't make sense. I mean, why would he do something like that and then go see her? - Crime of passion. It happens all the time. Explains what he did to her car, and the yelling match? One of the neighbours overheard them when he was out walking his dog. Even her friend Kate said she was upset. - No, no, no. He didn't go there to hurt her. He bought her a card and a $600 bracelet. He was going there to make up with her. Look if he'd sent this tape, the whole thing would have been pointless. Are you still on that diet? - Don't. - Look, she said that the killer had bugged her house. This tape must have come from him. - We didn't find any bugs. Shannon, this James guy doesn't exist. He's a ghost, no one's ever seen him. - I hear ya. But I'm telling you, I think you're wrong about this. - Alright. Let me ask you something: Why do you like her so much? - Look, you remember when Wes and I were having problems a couple of years ago? - Hmm-hmm. - Well, I bought her book. We're still here, right? - So she's a good doctor. Sometimes people just snap. - No, that's not what happened, I know it. - Alright, we'll keep looking for this James guy, but I don't want us to close our eyes to any other possibilities. I wanna know more about this tape. Let's see if we can get her to come in. - Honestly, detective, you're just wasting the doctor's time. She already told you everything she knows. - Am I a suspect? Do you think I killed my husband? - Dr. Manners, we know about the tape. - So you think I did it because I was angry at Rob for giving the tape to Toby Nederman. - We've seen it happen before. One partner gets some fame, some money, things aren't going so good in the marriage... - Rob had nothing to do with it. James did it, he told me. - Now, why do you think he would tell you that? Seems like that would be information that would be in his best interest to withhold. - Because he-- - Liz. You don't have to answer that. - Because he was going to kill me, so he had nothing to lose. - Dr. Manners, we are looking for him, believe me, but you are the only one who has seen him. - That's right, I am the only one who's seen him... besides my husband. - Detectives, this meeting is over with. If you have any further questions for Dr. Manners, you can reach me at my office. Don't worry, they don't have a good case against you. It's all circumstantial. - You know, that is the least of my worries, Devon. I've got a psychopath out there who wants to kill me and the police don't believe that. They're not gonna look for someone they don't think is real. - Liz, look-- - He will come after me. It is just a matter of time. - What would make a guy so angry that he'd go to such great lengths to hurt you? - Ah...! You just gave me an idea. - Do you understand how long this is gonna take? We have hundreds of hours of recordings here. I mean, we have stuff going back years. - It's the only thing I can think of. I have to find out who he really is before he finds me. - Well, how do you even know that his wife was a caller? Maybe he made it up. Maybe he doesn't even have a wife. - Gut instinct. It's the one thing I think he was really sincere about. Please, Dinah, I need to go through those disks. And it's not years, he said he lost her just a few months ago. - Okay, let's get started. [ Bits of conversations ] [ Sigh ] Oh, it's no use. We don't even know what we're looking for. [ Sigh ] - I have to keep searching. I mean, I know I can figure out which caller he's connected to if I can just figure out-- - Liz, let's just call it a night. We'll just try it again tomorrow fresh. - You're right. You're right. Thanks, Kate. Yeah. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye. [ Sigh ] [ Creaking door ] [ Door closing ] - Just had to go out for a smoke. Goodnight. - Goodnight. [ Locks the door ] - [Liz, recording]: You need to give your husband some space... - Good morning. Any luck? - Uh, not yet. - [Nancy]: He gets home late during the week, he spends all of his time with his friends... - [Liz, recording]: Well, maybe that's because you're driving him away. If you wanna see more of your husband, you need to spend less time bossing him around and more-- - Ha! Ha! I know exactly where you are. - [Liz, recording]: Your life could be in danger. [ Sigh ] - [Christine]: Dr. Liz, I can't-- - Dinah. [ Rewinding the recording ] Listen to this. [Liz, recording]: ...places that you can go, safehouses where he will never find you, and I can give you the number during the break. - [Christine]: You don't understand. He told me, he said, "There's nowhere on God's green earth you can hide." - That's him. His wife was Christine. Do you remember her? - Of course, the girl who kept calling the show but would never leave him. - "There's nowhere on God's green earth you can hide." He said that to me, those exact words. - This disk is from 3 months ago. I think that's the last time she called. - Three months ago... Do you think there's a chance that she used her real name? - They never do. - Yeah. Okay, well, let's just check the log and pool her calls. - [Liz, recording]: How old are you, Christine? - [Christine]: 31, but I was only 26 when we met. We've been together 5 years and we've been married for the last 2. [ Fast-forwarding ] - [Liz, recording]: And that was the 1st time that he hit you? - [Christine]: No, there were other times. The last one was pretty bad. I needed stitches and he wouldn't let me go to the hospital. [ Fast-forwarding ] - [Liz, recording]: Why doesn't he let you talk to your sister? - [Christine]: She wants me to leave him and he knows it. - [Liz, recording]: How does he know? - [Christine]: She told him and they got into a fight. And now he doesn't want me to talk to her anymore. - How many 31-year-old women do you think died between now and 3 months ago? - I could check the county recorder and find out. - Let's do it. - Look at this: Sarah Jane Lang, 31. Survived by one sister. Was hit and killed by a motorist about 3 months ago. Says here she was married to a Kyle Lundstrom. - Lundstrom. Hmm... How do I recognize that name? - Probably from the Lundstrom Corporation. Richard Lundstrom made a fortune in shipping before he died. His widow died about 2 years ago from cancer. - That's right. Is there a picture of Kyle? It's him. It's James. [ Phone ringing ] [ Phone still ringing ] - [Recording]: You've reached detective Sparks. Please leave a message. - Uh, yes, detective Sparks, this is Liz Manners. I know who he is. - Come on... Come on... Hope Sanctuary; must be it. There we go... - Alright, I'm gonna call it a night. - Okay. - You wanna get a drink? - No, thanks. I told Wes I'd try to get home before he fell to sleep. - Alright. See you tomorrow. - See ya. [ Sigh ] [ Beep ] - [Liz]: Uh, yes, detective Sparks. This is Liz Manners. I know who he is. His name is Kyle Lundstrom. And I have a picture of him. He's the man who killed my husband. So, uh, please, call me back as soon as you get this message. I also have something I need you to hear. - I knew it. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello. - Hi Liz, this is detective Sparks. I got your message and checked out this Kyle Lundstrom. You were right. Where are you? - I'm in my car. I'm almost at the safehouse. - Okay, I'll meet you there in 10 min. - Hello, Dr. Liz. Scream and I'll kill you. I told you I'd find you. - Look, you can't kill me here, because there's people all around. They'll hear you. - That's why we're going for a little ride. Get in the car. - Whatever you're planning, it's not gonna work. - Of course it will. You shot your husband because he was having an affair and trying to ruin your career. Now everyone will think you left the country and got away with murder. I just have to make sure that they'll never find your body. - It's too late for that. I know who you are, Kyle, and I know what you did to Sarah Jane. - Shut up! You don't know anything about that. - She called the station 3 or 4 times in tears and she told me everything. - You did it. You turned her against me. - She was terrified of you. - No she wasn't. - You took away her friends and her family, that's what she told me. - They poisoned her mind. They were just jealous of what Sarah Jane and I had. - Oh yeah? And what was that? - True love. The type of love that makes you wanna die for someone. - She didn't love you. She hated you. - Get in the car! - The police know who you are! - Shut up! Get in the car! - Stop it! Ah! - You make a single sound, I'll kill you and anybody else who comes out here. [ Whimper ] You got it? - Hi, I'm detective Shannon Sparks. I'm looking for Liz Manners. - I'm afraid she hasn't come back yet. - You're talking about Dr. Manners? - Yes. - Uh, I saw her Mercedes pull into the parking lot a few minutes ago. - You stay here. [ Pulls out her gun ] Liz? Liz! Liz! [ Muffled cries ] Ah! Ah! Officer down. Officer down, 4455 Jackson Avenue. - Ah...! - Aaah! Before the cops catch me, I am gonna have the pleasure of watching you die. - Freeze! Drop the gun! - Ah! - Aaah! Ah! [ Police sirens ] [ Knock! Knock! Knock! ] May I come in? - Sure. - How are you doing? - Good. I think I'll be going home Thursday. - Oh, that's great. - Those are beautiful. - I, uh, just came by to check on you, and to say thank you. Really, thanks for everything. - I, uh, I have something for you, in the top drawer. I think it belongs to you. - I really appreciate this. - You take care of yourself, Dr. Manners. - I'll do my best. - Good. - And now, live from the studios of WLOR, Philadelphia's number one talk radio station, it's The Dr. Liz Show, heard every weeknight from 8 to 10. Here's your host, Dr. Liz Manners. - Good evening, Philadelphia. I am Dr. Liz and it is good to be back. First, I just wanna take a moment to give a heartfelt thanks to all you listeners out there who stood by me during my ordeal. It was the support of people like you that gave me the strength to go on, so thank you. And now, let's go to your calls. Kayla, how can I help you? - Dr. Liz, I'm so happy you're back on the air. You've really been missed.
