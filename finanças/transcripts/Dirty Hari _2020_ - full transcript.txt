My name is Hari. Vasuda Group of companies, Chairman. I've never thought that I'll be in this stage of my life. I have everything. Luxury cars, Bungalows, Estates and everything... But, someone punished me in such a way to not enjoy these luxuries. Yes. It's a huge punishment. I feel that punishment now. I feel the karma in my life. No one should ever have such an experience. It's such a huge punishment. Boss! Don’t you feel like you are speeding up? Of course, I should. - Oh! - Yeah. Why did we come here? Listening to music and chat. That’s all? What do you want? Tell me. As if you don’t you know? Why did you wear a thin-layered shirt when it is so cold? You will keep me warm. Who’s that? Why did he stop behind us? Do you want me to check? No… No! Don’t go. I got scared. - Why? - I thought it’s your husband. Let him come. He’ll learn things from you. What are you waiting for? Rascal! He is back. Who is this guy? I don’t know. This place is dangerous. Let’s leave. Yeah. Oh! He’s coming. - Start the car! Faster! - Wait! Cut! Cut…Cut! Schedule pack up! - I’ll inform you about the next schedule. - Okay, sir. Super! Super, Jasmine! Super! This is your first movie, right? You killed it. Especially the lust in your eyes is amazing. Director! How did I perform? - You did well. Go… - He’ll never change. Sir! When is the next schedule? I will discuss with producer and I can inform you. Done? - Yeah…If you can let me know…. - Yeah…I will. Sir! I need money to pay the technicians for today’s shoot. Why are you asking me? Ask the producer. That is… Sir! Producer hasn’t come to the set since 2 days. Whom should I ask? You practice the scenes for next schedule. – Okay. Jasmine! You can go. I’ll let you know. – Okay. Come, Ananya. They won’t leave unless we pay them. Why are you telling me? Should I take care of all these? I should take care of the film. I should take care of money? Find the producer at the office. Go! You’ll become a star heroine after this movie. Is it? If you become a star then you should give me a chance to direct - Okay? - Hmm. Madam… Madam… Costumes! You want her to strip right here? I’ll bring them. Go. Tell me one thing. Is there any financial issue for this movie? It's their problem... Why should we involve? Okay. Let’s go. I’m filming an advertisement next week. I want you in it Oh, sure. Hey, Hari. When did you get down the bus? - Half an hour. - Have a drag. This won’t be sufficient for you, right? You came to the city from our town… To become rich? I’ve been your friend since childhood and I know you. You have a reason to come here. Come. This is your palace. This is hall... The kitchen is at the back and bedroom to the front. It’s hard to find a room in Hyderabad within your budget. How is the palace? Why don’t you speak? Say something. How is your wife? Great topic, man! I gave her a son last year. She wants one more. Do it then. You have nothing to do, right? I don’t have strength to handle both home and work. I get scared at night. She turns off the light when I enter the room. I turn on the light and she turns off. I told her that I’d go for family planning operation. She asked me to go for it. She said that she didn’t rely on me for the first child. It was a joke, right? I don’t think so. Hey! Don’t create doubts in me. Then I’ll have to fight her. Hey! My wife is calling. She’s in a good mood even now. Get some rest. I’ll see you in the evening. I’ll be there… I am nearby. I’ll be there soon. Ram said earlier that I've come to do something great. True! I have do something. One life! Just one life! So, Mr. Hari! You are from Nizamabad! You are a chess champion. You played many tournaments including state level. Wow! Nice. Why did you leave all that and joined as a coach in our club? That too part time! Sir! To be frank, I can't become another Vishwanath Anand even though I am talented. And at the same time, if I stay at my place… I might remain as a player (pawn) but will not stand out as a king. Oh! So, you want to be the king? Then, some queen has to come. Okay. Jokes apart! Anyways, the summer camp will start in 2 days. You can join tomorrow. Two important points to be noted in chess! First most important is that your mind should be very clear while you play. Second important point is you should play a fearless and a ruthless game. Your skill will develop on its own. You don’t have to worry about it. Okay? Awesome, Jas! Turn right. Sleeping with me is heaven. Sleeping with me is heaven. Is it about the girl or bed? Both. Rascal! Stop dreaming about things you can't get. Let’s booze now. I am so happy sir. I didn’t expect you to come. Actually, I am free today. So… Hari, he is Mr. Akash! Mr. Akash! This is Hari. Hari! Sir is a big shot. He comes here in his free time to play chess. - That’s really nice. - Will you play a game? Oh! Definitely! All yours! - Come on. Yeah. Check! What the! Duck, man! I was never defeated in this club. Mister? - Hari, sir. You opened the game unconventionally. You moved your knight in the first move. You weren’t nervous while making any move. I generally try to play attacking game. I understand. I’ll get you next time. Anytime, sir. You can call me Akash. Sure. Finish it. I’ll tell you. No. Actually, I have some work. I have to visit a music store. Hey! Are there music stores available in this era? I don’t know if it is available here. I have to enquire about it. Oh! Is music your interest? Yeah. Specially, I collect old classics. Oh! My uncle is also interested. He takes our entire family whenever there is classical concert. That’s really nice. I’ll inform you if there is a concert, will you join us? Yes. I would love to. I’ll call you, man. Madam. Thanks. - When did you come? - Just now, uncle. He is Hari. - That’s my uncle Mr. Ravi Shankar. - Hi, Hari. Akash told me that you’re an incredible chess player. - Very good player! - Sir! This is for you. M.S. Subbalakshmi concert when she was 8 years old. Subbalakshmi’s recording when was 8 years old, right? -Yes, sir. -I’ve been searching for it... What a rare collection! She’s also rare collection. My wife Pramila. - Greetings, madam. - Greetings. - She’s my daughter Vasuda. - Hello. Hi. I am Hari. - The show will start now. Let’s go. - Okay. I've been observing. I know. I am lucky that I've been observed. I strongly believe in luck. I strongly believe! You gave old disc's to my uncle recently, right? He is very happy. To be honest, he is flattered, man. I’m glad, Akash. I must say. Your family is really simple. Very simple! I like them a lot. Even your sister! She’s down to earth. You know, I lost my parents very early. My uncle and aunt fostered me. Vasuda treats me like her own brother. - Check! - Oops! Shit, man! I thought I could trick you while talking. Akash! Did you forget that I am a professional player? Hi. Hey. What a surprise! What are you doing here? I came here to see your game. Hi. - Hi… - Please sit. - What’s happening? As usual, this guy won the game. Oh! Really? Call dad. He wants to talk to you. Okay, guys! You guys have a talk. I’ll be right back. Do you want to play a game? I am not interested in mind games. Are you interested in painting? How do you know? Oh! I am so sorry. I came directly from the workshop. - That’s okay. It's okay. I spent all my life with black and white colors. Let these colors stay for a while. It’s looking nice. I am really sorry, guys. I have an urgent work. I have to go. What’s your plan, Vasu? - I will play a game. - Okay. Okay, then. You guys carry on. See you, Hari. - Bye, Akash. Will you have something? Shall we go out? So, you came to the city for good opportunities? I wish your dreams be fulfilled soon. Thank you. You are very simple. You are eating street food... You can always go to five star hotel whenever you want. But, you came here and have this food. I like it. My mother scolds me but I like street food more than food at star hotels. Did you taste Shadab Biryani? Ram Ki Bandi food is amazing. You should try it. And, Kulfi at Gokul Chat is amazing and awesome. You’ll love it. I actually don’t know these places. Oh! You’re new to the city, right? I will take you one day. Okay? Sure. Give it. - No… - It’s okay. Give it. It’s okay. Give it. Stop, Ms. Vasuda. Oh! Thank you. Hey, Prami. Do you know the land value that we bought in Coorg? Yes, aunt. It is 6 times expensive now. Hey! Why are you discussing about business at the party. - Why not? - Just chill! Forget everything. Okay? - Are you bored? - No. Nothing like that. I am just enjoying the song. What is this, uncle? Buddy! I’m at a party. They do party, they spend a lot, They buy cars and estates… I can’t mention all of them. What else do you want, man? Look out for a queen of that house. Then, you’ll be the king. Stop it. Yes, yes... There’s a queen. She is good too. You know that I believe in luck. Let’s see how my luck works for me. Listen to me. Hey…She can't wait! She’s grabbing my phone. Hey! Hey! After eating a plate full of meals... We feel like having desserts. When I saw her... I felt the same. That girl in the poster. I’m done for today. Listen to me and concentrate on the queen. Don't divert and focus on her. Okay? Okay. I’ll call you back later. I am really sorry for disturbing you. I saw your poster in Musheerabad. I am just checking if that’s really you. Sleeping with me in heaven. The poster’s tagline is very nice. That’s a joint. It's a joint. Careful! One sec! Hey. That’s it. Don’t you know that you should not get closer to your acquaintance so easily? Don’t you know that it is good to commit mistakes? You have a dirty mind. Dirty mind makes ordinary conversations much more interesting. You are risky but fun. Hey, Hari. What are you doing here? I had to attend a call… - Jasmine. - We already met. It seems he saw my poster. Hari! This is Jasmine… My girlfriend. She is an aspiring actress. She’s acting in a movie. That’s really nice. Yeah. I have to change. Bye. She’s hot, right? How long have you known her? It's been like 4 months. We met at a party and we got along well. You know... I am crazy about her. Why are you not drinking? Even Vasuda is waiting. Shall we go? Come. So you come here every week? Yeah. We have a lot of orphanages and old age homes here. So, we take care of them. You’ve been busy since 4 days. It is just for painting or something else? No, mom. You know Hari, right? He wanted to see the city and I took him around. Is it? By the way, is he just a chess player or does he have another job? Who? Brother’s friend Hari, dad. Yeah, Hari. He is a nice guy. He talks about books whenever we meet. His music knowledge is excellent. Not just that, dad. He has many dreams... He is very ambitious. Is it possible to give him a job in our company? Vasu! It's okay if you both are just friends. You have to think if it’s more than that. Children are taking proper decisions these days, Prami. What decisions? Become life partners after knowing them for a week? Look at Akash! He introduced Jasmine and proposed their marriage. That girl is crazy about movies. Moreover, she is a Christian. How will it work? What is your problem when brother likes her, mom? Acting is also a profession. Nobody is concerned about religion these days. I don’t know. Your dad said that you guys take proper decisions. It's your wish. [SINGING ‘JUST GIVE ME A REASON’ SONG] Whoa! That was so amazing. You are multitalented, Jasmine. - Thank you. She will forget everything while playing guitar. Hey! I am bloody hungry, man. Two minutes. I’ll prepare snacks. By the way, today is India-Pakistan match. Yeah. I guess it is semifinals. Give me the remote. Over there! Aren’t you interested in cricket? Should I help you? I am almost done. Arrange these sandwiches in a plate. Forks? I’ll look for it. Don’t worry. Jasmine! You’re a very nice girl. And I feel that you deserve a beautiful life too. Yes…one day! But on my own! Just one… Sorry… One sec! Forks! Jasmine! Tell me a dialogue from your film. No. Come on. It looks like heaven is very close when I see up there. Hey! But, you were there, Hari. What’s our relationship, man? Are you just a passing cloud or my destiny? Answer me, man. Both! Duck! - He gave the same answer. - Who? My hero character. Is it? How is your movie going? Shooting is done to some extent. They’re planning for the next schedule. In life, a bit of luck is always important. I don't believe in luck. We can achieve anything with hard work. I like your confidence. All the best. - Thank you. - Hi, ma’am. - Hi. Finish it quickly. - Hey, Hari. - Hi, Akash. How are you? I am good, man. How’s office? It’s huge! - Did you show him his cabin? - I’m taking him there. - Okay, man. - See you, Akash. Please come. This is our financial department and... This is your seat. Please. - All the best. - Thank you so much. - Hi. - Hello. Congratulations on your new job. Thanks to you. So, where are you going? I have two options. Akash and Jasmine are going out for a movie. They bought tickets for us too. Option number 2 I’ll take you on a long drive, which is my favorite. What’s your choice? Anything is fine for me. I thought that we’re going out for a movie when you came to pick me up. Okay. Let’s go for the movie. Sure? Seriously, I am fine with anything. Yeah, sure. Let’s go. It’s getting late, Vasu. Why aren’t they here yet? He’s on the way. - Hey, guys! - Hi. Where is Jasmine? She dropped in the last minute due to headache. Oh. Is it okay? You left her alone. It is Saturday night! How can we waste it? - Come. We’re getting late. - Let’s go. Where shall we go for dinner? Hari. – Yeah. - Come. - Yeah. Hey, Hari! What are you thinking? Yeah, Rowdy! Okay. I’ll come. Hey. Hey! How are you? All good. What are you doing here? Movie office is nearby. I came to know that the producer came to the office after many days. So, I am here to meet him. Is everything okay? You are looking tensed. I am worried about next shooting schedule. Don’t worry about that now. Okay. The producer might leave if we are late. So, let’s go. Yeah, sure. I’ve many hopes on this movie. I got a chance in this film after giving many auditions. I know that I’d get many offers if this movie is released. That’s my tension. I was tensed when I initially started playing chess tournaments. Meditation helped me a lot. Did you try it? - Sometimes. So, how was it? Duck! Duck! What happened? That dimwit is talking nonsense. It seems it might take some time to arrange finances. He’s asking me to wait. I'm losing hope. An actor can never lose hope. Okay? Can I have this along with the drink? - Yeah. - Then please take me for a drink. Okay, sure. Just a second. Let me get my bag. What did I say? Your mother. She was very beautiful. So beautiful! Beautiful than you? I’m sexy… But, she’s a classical beauty. What about your father? He left us when I was young. He left me and my mom. He didn’t even help us financially. So, mom was depressed and got addicted to alcohol. She lost her job too. She is suffering with Alzheimers. She can’t recognize people. Anyway, keep this aside. Tell me how you met Akash. He saw me at a party from distance. He came to me as fast as a missile. He said that he likes me. He proposed me one day. I didn’t have a reason to say ‘No’. Interesting! So, are you getting married? His aunt doesn’t like my profession. And I am Christian too. But, Akash said that he will sort out. So, let’s see. What’s going on between you and Vasuda? It’s going fine. I’ll have to wait and see how her mother reacts about me. Nothing like that... I saw how their family pampered you. Is it? Do you think so? You have a good chance unless you ruin it. Why will I ruin it? Incase, if you make a pass at me. I mean if you flirt with me... Then? Why will I flirt with you? I am very special. Do it like this? - Hmm? - Do it. That mole on your neck does make you more special. I agree. So, do you like it? I love it. Do you want to touch it? I don’t mind. Come. Touch it… Touch it. Hey, idiot. They are many such moles on my body. What about them? You are dangerous but fun! Now let’s go from here because I am high. So, get me a cab! Let’s go. We'll go after you finish it. Why are you driving fast? I am not speeding, uncle. I am driving slowly. This is our estate. It’s about 200 acres and my favorite place. Do you like it? - Oh yes, it’s beautiful. I really love this place. Look there. It was such a baby when I came here last time. Hey, cutie. Hey! - Hey, Vasu! Look here. - Damn cute! Eat. Eat. - They’ve grown up. - Yeah. Seriously. Cute. Okay, guys. Shall we leave? Yeah. She never pampered me like that. I think she loves them more than you. Jas. I am planning to expand my business this year. You should take care of that wing. Sure…I will. I will, uncle. I know that you and Vasuda are getting closer. So, I am being selfish. You should know more about the company. What is this? Why are you discussing business on a holiday? I'm hungry, let's have lunch, uncle. Vasu! Where's my ‘Fountain of Love’ novel? I don’t know. You play well, Jasmine. - I'm still learning, uncle. - Good. How’s your movie going? Actually, producer is delaying it. So, I am just waiting. There will be a solution very soon. Oh, okay. How do you keep hope without having clarity? What do you mean? Aunt! Jasmine has plenty of time. Let her try. Please don’t discourage her. I am not discouraging her. She can still try. But, ask her to think about it. Is she doing the right thing? Is this her future? Otherwise, can she change her mind and do some other work? Okay, aunty. I will consider your advice. It's up to you whether you’ll take it or not. But, you know that hardships are common in this industry. Especially for women! Aunt! Don’t think only in our point of view. She may not even be interested in listening to this. So, let’s stop it here. Why are you arguing with your aunt? No, uncle. That's not my intention. Why should we discourage her continuously? Maybe if she doesn’t succeed one day, let her realize that day. That’s she is not fit for this industry. Until then… Our friends laugh at us… for such stupid decisions you took. Hey! Let’s be practical. Okay? We have back up. We have our companies. She can start working there. How long will she live a false life? Dreaming as if she’s a popular heroine. - Excuse me. - Jasmine. I like to be alone for sometime, uncle. - Hey, Jas. - What is this, aunt? We came here to relax. What’s this nuisance? - She is delicate. - This is not nuisance. We are worried about you. Okay? Hey! I’ve been looking for you. I am very upset. I just want to be alone. Sorry. I didn’t want to disturb you. I want to drink more. You become flirtatious when you drink. - Really? - Yes. You’ll become romantic too. Do you have weed, Hari? Strong! Yeah. Filthy woman! She talks nonsense. Bloody hell! Being rich doesn’t make them great. I will lead my life. Not the way they wanted it to be. This is my bloody life. I’ll do whatever I want. What the hell is their problem? This world really doesn’t care about you… …Until you’re famous! I do care for you, Jas. Thank you. I want to get higher. What do you want? I don't know. Are we doing wrong? Why are you guys so dull? Trust me. I will complete this movie. I will release the movie and it will be a hit. I have headache. I’ll just go out. Okay? What happened to her? She loves someone. So, what’s the problem? She got ducked by someone else. Oh duck! - I need to call someone. - Okay. Rowdy! I can't roam around these movie offices. Let me know if the proposal is concrete. Otherwise, no. Okay. Bye. Why aren’t you taking my call, Jasmine? I was busy. Why are you avoiding me since that day? See, Hari. Whatever happened has happened. I mean, I lost my control at that moment due to some reasons. Because I was upset and high. I felt your breath, Jasmine. I can't forget you. Please, Hari... Don’t talk like that. I know that you’re an good actress. But, stop acting with me. Hari! I'm not dumb and I knew that you had feelings for me since the beginning. Of course, I also felt comfortable with you. I don’t when it turned out as a crush. That’s the reason. But, let’s think about the reality. Both of us will be in the same family. We are involved with two different people. They are also in love with us. So, let’s not get into this. We have to move on. I am not able to move on, Jasmine. No. No. Please, Hari. No. - You’re over thinking, Jasmin. - Forget it. It’s over. Forget it. Okay? Car is smooth. Did your queen gift you? It’s our company car. They gave me a house too. Duplex apartment. Hey! You got lucky, man. Make sure you maintain this. Okay? What’s going on, guys? There! What are you doing? Planning to have kids before marriage? What are your plans? Why don’t you discuss anything with me? - Mom! - Hey, man! What is it? Please, mom. Did I say something wrong? Yeah! Bedroom comes after the wedding in our days. Nowadays, wedding after the bedroom. – Mom! Yes or No? What do you say? - Is it true or not? Am I wrong? - This is too much. Stop it. It’s not too much. Am I wrong? Let me talk. My wife is a rare collection. Don’t take it seriously. Okay? Actually, uncle! Vasuda and I were about to discuss our wedding. We never objected you both, did we? Akash also discussed about it many times. Let’s talk to your parents once. My parents are no more. I lost them when I was young. I am so sorry. Please come closer, sir. Smile. Come. - This is our new house. - Wow! Painting work is pending in some rooms. And this is the poolside. That’s the dining. My painting is over there and that’s our bedroom. This is incredible, Vasu. This is my dad’s gift for us. I never expected that I’d live in such house. It’s really nice. It is beautiful. Can I ask you something? Tell me. I want babies. I want four kids. That’s it. Just four? It’s not a joke. I seriously want four kids. - All together? - Yes. All together and you can do it. Yeah. I can do it. Duck! What happened, Akash? Hari! I have to say something. Yeah! I broke up with Jasmine. What? Are you serious? To be honest, I withdrew. I thought next is your wedding. What happened? You know what, our relation might look good to others. But, there’s a big cold war happening between us. Issues keep going between my aunt and Jasmine. And I am not happy. I am nothing without aunt and uncle. I must have behaved ruthlessly with Jasmine. But now, they are happy. That’s it. I don’t know what to say. Jasmine can do what she wants with her career. - Hello, sir. - Yeah. - Can I help you? - I'm here to meet Jasmine. - Film Actress? - Yeah. - She shifted from here. - Oh! She shifted out? Yes, she shifted few days ago. Any idea where she went? Maybe she was depressed that the movie was put on hold. and she also had personal issues. Oh! Any idea about her mother’s native place? I don’t know. Hey… What are you thinking? Nothing. Work related. You know? It has been more than a week since we made love. I am just being tired, dear. Nothing else. I am sorry. Do you have any problem with me? Why are you talking like that? Tell me if there’s something like that. It's okay. Nothing like that. Most of my cousins are pregnant. What’s the problem with us? Stop over thinking. Okay? Everything will be fine. I am really sleepy. Yes, sir... I promise you this time. Thank you. Sir. You told me to remind you about Madam's art exhibition. Oh, today is art gallery exhibition, right? Yes, sir. And you have a doctor appointment today. Okay sir. They’re more on the other side. And this one took a lot of time. I took one-week time to complete both the eyes. - I’ll show you my favorite part. - Sure. And this one is really close to my heart. We’re trying to show the bond between the mother and the child. I'm sorry. Hari... Are you looking for the gallery? That way. Yeah, actually there is no signal on my phone... You know what? They bought my painting. - That's nice. - Meet my husband. Hi. I have packing to do. I’ll see upstairs, okay? Meanwhile, I have to make a call. - Come. Please come. - Yeah. Where are you? What’s happening with you? I searched a lot for you. I know that you’re hurt. Obviously. My career was unsuccessful and Akash ditched me. I will obviously be upset, right? I never wanted to come back but… Your heart is here. That’s because your goal is here. Where are you staying? Bollaram! Why? Are you staying alone? Why are you asking me all that? You’re married, right? Jasmine! Let’s catch up for a drink. We can talk there. - How should I contact you? - Hey! Hello! Jasmine! What a surprise! Look! Who I bumped into Vasu. - Hi. - How are you? I’m good. You look great. Thanks. I heard Akash got married. Yes. His wife is pregnant right now. Oh, wow! Congratulations. - Madam. - Excuse me. That’s Sravya! My secretary! - Hi, Sravya. - Hi. Madam! We got the quotation for packing… Please take a look into it. - Just 2 minutes. - Yeah. Tell me. We need to send paintings without any damage. Jasmine! Give your number, Jasmine. No. Please. Jasmine. Please give your number. No, I can’t. Why do you want my number? – Jas! Jas! Just look at me. - Give me your number. - No way. Please, Jas. Okay, Jasmine! Actually, we have to leave. We should see the doctor. We’ll catch up soon. - Yeah sure. - Bye. - Bye. See, the doctor said that there's no problem for children. We just need to concentrate more. Okay. You go home. I'll go to the club now. It has been many days since I played the game. - Yeah… Bye. - Bye. You leave. I'll come later. What do you want? Go away. You would've thrown my phone away if you didn't want to meet me. Duck off! Hey! What are you doing? Nice flat! Sweet and simple. Rowdy searched it for me. She's assistant director. How's your movie so far? That's done! It's been put on hold for many months. That director is a crazy fellow. He still wants me to practice those scenes. What are you doing now? I am giving auditions. I have no idea what happens. What about money? I mean expenses and all. I act for some ads. In fact, Rowdy is helping me. So, there is no financial stress. What is the time? It's time for you to leave. I don't feel that way. You are looking very beautiful. Did you sleep well last night? Yeah. Do you know? The paintings in my gallery were all sold. I gave all the money to our trust. That's really nice. Congratulations. Did you see? - I am getting late, dear. I should go to the office. I need to freshen up. Hari. The doctor said that I could get pregnant easily if we try it in the morning. That is… I am getting late to the office. I am already too late. It’s okay, you can go late today, Hari. Please stay. Just a second. He asked me to take this tablet before sex. I'll have it. “Let me become a part of you” “Let’s make love” “Let me melt within you” “Let’s make love” “Let’s make this moment scintillating” “Let’s make love” “Let’s make love” “I feel a tide within me” “Don’t let me go” “I can see our dreams take flight” “Don’t let me go” “Let me become a part of you” “Let’s make love” “Let me melt within you” “Let’s make love” “You arms bind me by surprise” “I feel so restless away from you” “Pull me on to your back like the sheets” “Do you feel the room heat up?” “I feel a tide within me” “Don’t let me go” “I can see our dreams take flight” “Don’t let me go” “Treasure me in your senses” “Let’s make love” I didn’t realize where my life with Jazz was headed. To be honest, I was totally lost in her presence. Totally! “Let me become an eternal part of you” “Let’s make love” Hari! Did you see the queen doll that I gave you? It should be on the side table. I searched a lot for it. I cannot find it. Listen now... Don't worry. You'll find it. I am getting really late. Come. Let's have breakfast. I went to China for a week. I missed home food. That's why he eats dal rice. Brother! My husband took office responsibility after you left. He is never free. What are your plans today? - What do you say, Lalli? - Shall we go out for a movie? Yeah. The movie reminds me of something. Lalli and I went to the market two days ago. I saw Jasmine there. Yeah! We met her at the mall too. Yeah… She said that she lives in Borabonda. Is she seeing anyone? I did not ask her. It won't be nice. Yeah. That's right. It won't be nice to ask her that. - Hey! How are you, guys? Hey! What are you doing here? My wife didn’t cook. So, I had to come here. - Oh! Okay. - Hari! You were rushing that day. Me? When? That day when you took a cab at Borabanda. - In Borabanda? - I called you but you ignored me. You must have mistaken me with someone. I don't even remember going there. That's around 6 pm. No chance! You've mistaken. It's you! 100 percent! 200 percent sure! That's not him. We've got many cars and drivers. Why would he travel in a cab? I saw him, Vasuda. Hey! Check if you've got Alzheimer's No! I saw Hari. - Really! - Hey! Don't irritate us. Your wife must be waiting for you. Go! - No. I really saw him. - It's okay. Navya! Sir! Are there still any appointments today? One meeting is there with Amar Branets. Ok, cancel it! But sir, its very important. I have an urgent work. Hari! Where're you going? I'll be back, dad. I have some urgent work. Today an important meeting is there. My close friend met with an accident. Oh! Say no more, Hari. I am really upset. I already told you that we should meet my mom this weekend. Vasuda planned something this weekend without telling me. So, Vasuda stressed you, right? What happened to you? Why are you in such a bad mood? Yes, I am in a bad mood. I failed another audition today. Nothing is working out for me. She was right that day. All I do is a waste of time. Akash's aunt said that. Your mother-in-law. - Jasmine! Let's not get there now. Then, let us speak about us. What are we? What's our relation? What is my identity? Am I your part-time pleasure? Jasmine! Why are you being so harsh? It's boring over there. Vasuda is desperate to get pregnant and tries all day. I feel mechanical in bed. There are no emotions. But, you are not like that and you know that really well. To be honest, I am addicted to you. You will not leave Vasuda for me at any cost, right? I might leave her. I have no idea. Before you say it, see that you mean it. Deep down your heart, you know that I meant it. Don't you? I love you, Jasmine. I cannot survive without you. - Happy Dussera, aunt. - Happy Dussera. - How are you doing? - I am doing well, aunty. - Thank you. - Where is uncle? Don't you know about your uncle? He's always worried about his business. Okay. I made a lot of snacks. All of you should stay back for lunch. - Don't dare to go out. - No, aunt. I am thinking about you. I'll meet you in the evening. Okay? Yeah. I shall miss you. - Hari. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Take care. See you. - Happy Dussera, uncle. - Wish you the same. Don't mind me saying this now. It is okay, uncle. Our extended wing is under your control, right? It came to my notice that we are in losses. Yes, uncle. I realized that I took some careless decisions. I was careless. My decisions backfired. It was all good back then. No problem, Hari. It is common in any business. Aunt and I want you and Vasuda to live happily. - That's it. - Sure, uncle. I will start concentrating more on it from now. I trust you, Hari. Hari! Do you know? Prakash went to London by road recently. - London by road? - Hmm. - Seriously, Prakash? - Yeah. Hey! He must have gone with his girlfriend. Otherwise, why would he go that far? Hey! Don't spoil the relation with my wife. Hari! Shall we plan a road trip? To Leh-Ladakh! Wow! Superb plan! – Great idea. Actually, we’ll go in cars. - What cars? Are you mad or out? - Hello. - Hi. Just give me a minute. Its an important call. You guys continue. Yeah. Hello. Tell me. - I am missing you. - I miss you too. Okay. - Are we meeting today? - I can’t make it. No. We have to meet. It is not possible, today. Actually, it is not possible tomorrow too. Let's meet on Monday. Please. - I really need to see you. - I'll call you back. Okay. Let's go for a walk in the morning from tomorrow. - I am eating a lot these days. - Did you start again? Hari! Join us. - Sure, uncle. Ask him to stop boozing, Hari. Hey! That's unfair. Are you talking about quitting alcohol, aunt? - Hey! I’ll kill you. - This is right. - Sir. Madam called for you. - For me? Shall we go to the farmhouse next week? - Yeah. Sure - Hello. - This is Jas! Jas! Are you crazy? Why did you call father-in-law's house? Your mobile is turned off. So, I called here. Okay, tell me. What happened? When will you come? We shall meet tomorrow for sure. I cannot wait until tomorrow. What happened now? What's so urgent? I am pregnant. Hello. Hello. Hari. Let's meet tomorrow and talk. We shall buy some land. It will develop in 3 years. Its value might get 6 times higher. Why should we opt for development, uncle? Vasuda would build her dream home there. Who is it? You've been getting calls since evening. It's my secretary Navya. Didn't Navya go to her native place? Actually, it was my mistake, Akash. I asked her to make my schedule no matter where she is. There's an important meeting on Sunday for 2 hours. I'll be free when it gets done. Uncle! I cannot come for a walk tomorrow morning. I got some work to do. Navya called me just me. It is okay, Hari. Let him go. The company is Hari's responsibility. Let him go. How is it even possible? Haven't we used protection? Don't you know how many times we used it? Did you ever stop when there wasn't protection? No matter how hard I try, nothing happens over there. And I didn't use protection maybe just once. That ducking sex! Yeah! Because we ducking love each other. There's no love over there. - I am in no mood for jokes, okay. I am not joking, Hari. We are in love. That's why I am pregnant, okay. I know that, Jasmine. But… I have to sort it out. - Sort out? What? What will you sort out? What is your problem? I don't have a problem. What about society? - Duck society! You promised to leave your wife for me. Why do you care about society? Aren't you going to leave your wife for me? Jasmine! We need some time. Will you be like this until then? See, my dad left me. I cannot do the same with my child. Get it? Your plan will not work, okay. I won't kill this baby! Simple! Okay. Don't kill! How should we make a living? Find another job somewhere. Let's live together happily with our baby. What are you talking about? Have you gone crazy? I am talking about facts. We are in real love. Our baby is our blessing. That's it. I'm out of my mind. Listen. I am really blank. Let's talk later. I need time to think. Bye. See you. - Okay, go. But, take the right decision. I am clear about it. You should also be clear about it. Are you back so soon? Vasu! I need to talk to you. Come inside. Yeah. What do you want to talk about? Nothing. It is about us. Why? Is there any problem? Yeah. Is it about financial problems at office? Don't worry about that. Don't worry. I don't know. I am unable to focus on work these days. Dad and Akash are there to support. You can take rest and get back to it. Everyone likes you. Don't you know it? I mean, Vasu! You keep getting calls these days. Is it about that? You react in a strange manner at that moment. Do you have an affair? Me? Yeah. No! Tell me the truth. What's wrong with you today, dear? Why are you being so silly? You don't love me that much, right? Why are you talking like this today? What's wrong with you? Tell me. You know that I love you, right? Then, what's the problem? I don't know. I just feel… I am unable to connect emotionally. Are you crazy? Why do you think like that? Is it because I didn't get pregnant? I just feel really guilty. See, Hari! We consulted the doctor. We are absolutely fine. And, you always say that luck should favor us. Maybe because of that! I am so sorry. I will not discuss this topic with you again. I love you. I love you. Why did you hide this matter at me? I thought to tell this on weekend buddy. It's like hell! What a blunder buddy! I decided to leave Vasu for her. I went home to tell that to Vasuda. But, I couldn't say anything after seeing her. It is not that easy. Practically, I do not have a future with another girl. I am used to this comfortable life. But, you do not love Vasuda. I can't say that there is no love. But, I have feelings for someone else which confuses me. My bad! That isn't love! It is lust. Both! It is not about love or lust. What should I do after leaving my wife? Whom should I give up this lifestyle for? For the girl you love! Okay. I will leave her. How should I make a living? Tell me. I'd become jobless again. I tried a lot to get here. Don't you know? What are you planning to do? I will become the company's boss very soon. They like me a lot. To be honest, they love me. Do you get it? We're going to rotary for three weeks. I'll tell to vasudha about us as soon as I return. Three weeks? What are you saying, Hari? Stop playing around me. Okay. Hey! Why would I play with you? Why don't you tell her right now? It is not a casual thing to say without thinking. So, why did you say that you'd leave her for me? Why did you say that it was boring over there? Why did you say that you're addicted to me? - Is this trip important to you? - I didn't plan it. I don’t want to hurt them. So, I am going. That's it. Oh! So, it is a family trip, is it? Listen! It becomes news when her family finds it out. - They will get hurt. - That's their problem. Why should I care? Why are you going on a trip with her without clarifying about us? Talk slowly. Look! I am really jealous. Okay. If you guys become romantic after going there, I can't take this all. You are mine and just mine. That's it. - Jasmine. Calm down. No. This is not right. I know that I am going to get ducked up! For my sake, just give me 3 weeks. Duck! Are you back already? Give me 2 minutes. Did you know that the road trip has been canceled? Why? What happened? Sekhar planned the trip, right? He had a fracture. So, the doctor asked him to take bed rest for 3 months. That's why we planned to wait for 3 months. The trip has been postponed to this summer. Sravya! - Ma'am. Can you just move all these things to the storeroom, please? Okay, ma'am. Vasu! What do you want for your birthday? I don't know. Is it your birthday, Vasu? Thanks for forgetting it. Will I ever forget? Actually, I got you birthday gift. Oh! I thought you forgot. I have been waiting for your call. It has been a week already. Someone is always around me. What should I do? I couldn't call you. When are you coming back? Mostly around 3 weeks. 3 weeks more? You told me that the trip is planned for 3 weeks, right? Yeah, I know. But… everyone is planning to extend the trip now. Hari! My parents are leaving. - Yeah. I am coming… Hey. Who's that? Where are you? Haven't I told you that I am at Ladakh? You said that you'd tell Vasuda about us after getting back. It is better to end this as soon as possible. Let's talk later. - Are you missing me? - Yeah, okay…Bye. I guess your flight is at 9 pm. You guys better get going now. We are very happy, Mr. Hari. - We shall go ahead with the deal. - Thank you. - It is all our pleasure. - Thank you. Have a safe flight. Have a safe flight, guys. Hi, Rowdy! How are you? - I am fine. It has been so long. How are you doing? I am fine. How's the director. He is good. Hey! We haven't met for many days. Okay, sure. Let's meet. Yeah. Send me the location. Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello, Jas. Hello. I'll call you. Your voice is unclear. What do I know? - Hello. - Hari! Where are you? I am at Leh. I'll be back in a week. Okay? I'll meet you when I am back. Okay, bye. You bloody loser! - Jasmine… - How dare you lie to me? Did you cheat on me? – Jasmine! Calm down… Did you lie to me about a trip? Did you cheat on me? - Jasmine! Listen to me, Jasmine. - You are a fraud. - Jasmine! Listen to me. - Cheater - Jasmine listen! - Jasmine Let’s talk first. - Leave me! This is the office.

Bloody idiot! - Take me to your wife. - Jasmine! Calm down. Jasmine! How dare you cheat on me? Bloody idiot! I am telling you the truth, Jas. We shortened our trip. It has been two days since we came back. I have to tell Vasuda about us, right? That is why I came early. You don't understand and scream. - Are you crazy? What do you think of me? I am going crazy as time passes. I can't take this all. I am pregnant. Sorry, Jas. I know that. I am really sorry. Really? Did you even try talking to Vasuda? I tried talking to her last night. You called me at that time. - What am I supposed to do? - Is it? I don't even remember what I told you. I said that I was at Ladakh. You told me that you're at Leh. Yes, Jas. I said, Leh. Vasuda was beside me. I was tensed and I don't remember what I said. So, what? Haven't you planned to tell her? I am trying to tell her. I couldn't tell her. I will tell her. Okay. I will tell her if you have a problem. - Is that okay? - What? You will tell her? Have you gone crazy? You've gone crazy. Look! We are going to have a baby. Aren't you responsible? Try to be if you are not. I will take that responsibility. Both the baby and you! I will do any financial help you need, okay? Let it be like this. Oh! Like a keep? I never said that. Bloody idiot! What are you saying? Do you have any sense? - I will smack you! - What? What did you say? Duck you! I love you. Try to understand that. I love you, Hari. I just want you. Jas. Hey! I'll not stay calm regarding this issue. Do you get it? Are you threatening me? What? You threaten to go to my house if I don't do what you say, right? Bloody idiot! What's this? What was our relationship so far? Is it false? Were those words of love a lie? No, Jas! It's not a lie. Talk to Vasuda then. Someone should explain it to her. You tell her or I will tell her. I will tell her tomorrow. - Jas! Calm down. I will tell her. Give me one day. Okay? I will do the right thing. This is an old pistol, It contains 12 bullets. I also have a revolver One minute.

There's a surprise for you. Come soon. Okay? I'll be there. Today we are here to celebrate my daughter's 25th birthday. In our life, It is not important to know our stature in life. It is important to know who walks along with us in the path of life. Of course! My family and employees are here. I expect the same cooperation from all of you. And now I declare why it is a special day since my son-in-law is here. Now a certain amount of time has come. For the youngsters to take over. And relieve me from the position where I am in. All the company matters will be taken care by my son-in-law Mr. Hari. And he is not just a CEO! Congrats! He's the chairman of the company. I invite Vasuda and Hari to start the celebrations. Note down those details. Both of them are girls. There are two bullet shots. The murderer covered them and threw them off the bridge. Shit! What happened? Jasmine is murdered. What? They found two bodies. Someone killed and dumped their bodies in the lake. There’s another girl too. They were shot with a gun. [NEWS]: ‘Jasmine and Shilpa’s murders in the city are a sensation.’ ‘ACP Ajay is investigating the case. Both the girls work for Telugu film industry. The police are yet to find the culprits. The police said this case will be cracked soon. Coronavirus has effected Mumbai region. - Hello, uncle. - Hi, Hari. You are going to take my place as a chairman. - I wish you all the best. - Thank you, uncle. - Thank you so much. - Aunt will talk to you. I believe a vision without execution is nothing. But, daydreaming, guys! And, I have been a professional chess player and I always played my game ruthlessly and fearlessly. - And I really sincerely believe… - Sir. Excuse me. One minute, please! - Is it urgent? - Yes, sir. Excuse me, guys. Sir. I got a call from the ACP office. They asked you to call back immediately. Send me his number. I'll call. Okay, sir. Hello, sir. I am Hari. Chairman of Vasuda Group of Companies! Oh! Hello, Mr. Hari. You asked me to call, is it? You should come to the ACP office once. What for? I do not prefer to say it on call. Just a few questions and I think our office will be comfortable to do that. Should I come with my lawyer? I certainly hope not. Okay. I’ll park the car, sir. Is this place secure? Yes. Sir. This is Hari. - He's ACP. - Hello, sir. Hail Lord! – Hail Lord! Please take your seat. Do you anything about Jasmine and Shilpi murder? Are you comfortable sir? - Yeah, yeah, of course. Please go on. Do you know Jasmine and Shilpi, sir? Yeah! I know Jasmine. How? Actually, She is the ex-girlfriend of my wife's cousin. Akash! Yes. But, they broke up. Did you continue after that? I mean did you meet Jasmine after that? Did you talk to her? I hardly remember. We must have met few times. I mean I met her along with my wife when I went to pick her. Okay… What's your opinion on Jasmine and Shilpi murders? Why are you asking my opinion? That murderer is smart, sir. There's not even one clue. No one knows why he did that murder. There's no CCTV footage or mobile data. He made sure that we don't find such evidence. He must be a big shot, sir. Money manages everything, sir. Hail, Lord! Murderers are careful about critical things and get caught with trivial things. This ring is on Jasmine's finger. I enquired about it and got to know that it is a rare diamond. That bill at jewellery store is on your name. Did you give it to Jasmine? - Sir. That's... She invited me to her birthday and I should gift her something, right? I gave her a ring. Right! When you met her few times. Yeah. You gave her a costly gift, sir. Jasmine owns a costly duplex apartment, sir. She owns it. How did she earn that money? How would I know how she got that money? A huge amount was transferred to Jasmine's account from your account. She was working for a film and that film was stopped abruptly. So, she had some financial stress. She asked me for help. I gave her whatever I could. But, I don't know what she did with that money. What kind of relationship did you both have? It was like a brother-sister relationship. Brother-Sister! Your sister tattooed your name Hari on the left side of her chest. No sister will do that, sir. Lovers do such things. Are you trying to frame me? You are trying to say I murdered them. Sir! Many people are named as Hari. It is a common name. Her boyfriend must be Hari. Or there must be another reason. How am I supposed to know, sir? It could be just pure coincidence. - It is not a coincidence, Mr. Hari. You both had a relationship. That's why you gave her a ring. You bought her a costly house. You and Jasmine must have got into a fight. You killed Jasmine and her friend who tried to stop you. You cleaned up everything and threw them in the lake. What are you saying, sir? Sir. I am the chairman of a reputed company in the city. My father-in-law is a respected person! Why would I murder, sir? I haven’t been close to any other girl. Why would I kill? I just gave her the ring as her birthday gift. Why are you linking up that with this case? I'm the only Hari she knows? I don't understand anything about that Hari tattoo. I have nothing to do with it. Why are you trying to frame me? If you keep talking like this, I think I need to call my lawyer. Greetings, CI sir. - Lawyer? - No, sir. I'm a witness. Sir, do you need help? - It's okay. I can help you. - No problem. I can do it. Oh no! How can you do it alone? - It's okay, leave. Why is he shifting the house at this hour? - CI, Who is he? - Sir. He is Parthasaradhi! He saw someone carrying sacks on the night of Jasmine's murder. He came to the police station and complained. He's the major witness, sir. I asked him to come after knowing that sir is coming here. He might identity. I did identify, sir. Do you remember me? We played chess at the club. I won and you lost. You shouted on me because no one has ever defeated you. We'll play one more game if you want to. You'll win next time. For Sure! - Mr. Parthasaradhi. Give me 2 minutes. Sir! You called me to identify a suspect, right? Did he come? Where is the suspect, sir? Call him, sir. I will identify him. Should I wait longer? I have to attend a meeting. Okay, sir. Hail, Lord! What should I do, sir? Sir. Is it going to be late? I have an appointment. Hail, Lord! We'll call you if we find the murderer. Go. Okay, sir... See you. - Sir! Leave! - Okay, sir. I did everything like you said. - Hello. - Vasuda, It's all over. He took care of everything. He managed to hide Jasmine's pregnancy reports from doctors. But, he neglected trivial things. ACP interrogated him strictly. Sir. But, what can he do if all others support me? Thanks to CI who gave us the information. Okay, Vasuda... You relax. Hari will never know that we managed everything. I'll call you back. Okay, brother. Bye. Where are you going? That's not the way to our farm, right? I'll tell you. Suspense? Yeah. - Vasu! Whose house is this? - Come inside. We'll talk. Jasmine! Yes, I am Jasmine. I came here to take you with me. You said that you'll take me after earning money well. However you earned well. Yeah mom. Come on! Let's pack your belongings. Ok. Did you understand? She is Jasmine's mother. She has Alzheimer's She thinks that I am her daughter. Oh! Okay. Are you planning to take her to the old age home? No. Our home! I know that you'd be shocked. You haven't done a small mistake. But, I saved you. Do you know why? Jasmine's life is over. But, my life has just begun. Yes. My life has just begun. I am pregnant. Why should my child and my parents face the consequences of your mistake? Why should they suffer? You should alone suffer. Yes. You are the only one who has to suffer. You will see Jasmine's mother every day at our house. You must go through that punishment. Hari! Yeah. I did not find it anywhere in the house. But, I found it today. The queen I gave you as a gift. It's in our house only. In your closet. I am happy that I got it back. You understood that I know everything that has happened. I will never discuss this topic again. You can’t talk about it either. This is the biggest punishment for you. Yes! The biggest punishment for you! You can enjoy now. The money and luxurious life! Sir! Producer sir! Director! Finish the movie as soon as possible. Take the money that you need. - What about the heroine? We'll change her. We completed just one schedule. I don't know where she is. I went there that day. I was the witness to her murder. It's all about the timing! - Sir! What witness, sir? - Nothing. See, you directed the movie like the way you wanted so far. Yes, sir. From now on, shoot the film according to my direction. Okay? Opening scene… He's here again. Who is this guy? - I don't know. - Duck! - We need to go. Hey! Not like that. The gun should be fired differently. Okay? Do something new. Hey! Shoot him in the ass. - Right, sir? - Newly… That's it. I told him. Shoot! [SCREAMS] Hey, director! one more take. One more! Cut it! One more?
