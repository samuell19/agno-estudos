(upbeat acoustic guitar music) (spitting) - About time you started putting the tar to her. - Why don't you worry about your business, and I'll worry about mine. - This is my business. - I keep forgetting that. God dammit, Jimmie Lee, come and give me a hand on this crap. - Alright girls, get your mops ready, it's time to do the floors. (hammering) (hammering) - All I wanna see is assholes and elbows, assholes and elbows. - You like the sound of that, do you? - I take it you don't. - No I don't, Mr. Fart. If you don't get off of my ass, I'm gonna get a piece of yours. - That does it, Johnson, you're fired. - Well suits me fine, Mr. Pood, I wasn't looking for a job when I found this one. - Get back to work. Done wasted the best part of the day. - Shit on that. Lincoln done freed the slaves. - Stick it up your ass, Mr. Pood. Sideways. - Don't come no closer. - That'd be hard, as fast as you're going backwards. This is what we think of you and your fuckin' roof. - Whoa, Mr. P. Sure did scream like a good ol' rat when you told him to stick that mop up his ass over there. - I'm about ready to whoop that booger's ass. I believe it'd turn about 10 different shades of red, on old skeet guarding Mr. Pood. (laughing) - Well we don't have to take no more orders from that sorry old bastard. I tell ya. If I had a dime for every job I had walked off of, or been fired off of, cause I didn't, piss in a pie, pull mesquite, or swab out oil stains fast enough, while seeing some sorry old gang boss laying around farting in the goddamn shade. - It's true. We'd all be millionaires for sure. - Shit yeah. - Oh shit, worst thing is when my old lady finds out I done cussed my way off another job. - Tell her you been laid off. - She don't give a shit. Fired, laid off, carried home in a bucket, all she knows is ain't no paycheck next week. - Man I tell you, I'm so thirsty I could drink Milwaukee dry. How about we go over to the spot and drink some beer. - Hot damn, what you say, Red? - Might as well, can't dance. (upbeat country music) - Howdy boys. Getting some strings? - No. - No strings to us. Got three Lone Stars? - You got it. - Are they cold? - Coldest beer in town. Try it, alright? - You know the difference between a tribe of pygmyies and a girl's track team? - Nuh uh. - A tribe of pygmies is a cunning bunch of little runts. (laughing) - Shit. - Red, you know the difference, you know what the sound of a pubic hair is? - Sound of a pubic hair? - Yeah. (spits) (laughing) (spits) (laughing) (hooting) Looks like some loose fur pie. - Boy I could use some of that. - I thought you were married. - I ain't married, my old lady is. (laughing) - That looks like Uncle Jimmie's car. - [Emma] You're right, I wonder what they're doing there. They're supposed to be working. - [Jimmie] Where are you girls from? - We're from Lampasas. We come down here to check on our cousin, whose husband was just run off from her. And uh, all we found when we got there was a mad landlord who said our cousin's run out on a month's rent and took the Venetian blinds to boot. (laughing) - Well that's not-- - I had to call that man a damn liar. - [Jimmie] Did you? - Our cousin wouldn't do anything like that. - [Jimmie] Yeah? - We're from a good stock. - [Jimmie] Yeah, that's true. - We got an uncle over in Comanche, deputy sheriff. - Well that's a hell of a note. What did you say your names was? - [Linda] This is Bonnie Mae and I'm Linda. - Can I get you girls a couple 'nother beers? - Sure. - [Jimmie] You're all ready for one, aren't ya? Okay. Got it. - What line of work are you boys in? - Uh, we're in the construction business, how bout y'all? - Well I'm a clerk over at the brand new Woolworth's in Lampasas. And she works over at the county library. - [Floyd] Oh, like books do you? - Oh, hell no, I just stack them up, I don't read 'em so much, except, well, some by that guy Miller? Henry Miller? He writes about them things people do when the lights go down. Well, we love those books. The librarian she asked me to get rid of them books, throw 'em in the city lake. I just pretended I did, I took them on home, put 'em on my own shelves. - Sure would like to come home and read 'em with you some time, honey. - Well, maybe some time, we can see about that. - [Jimmie] Here you go, ladies. Red, there's your beer. - [Linda] Thank you. - Yeah. - Hey, uh, I bet y'all didn't know I was a fan dancer in the state fair in 1968. - I'd have never guessed. - She was a topless dancer over in Midland. - Fan dancer ain't all you've been, honey. - Listen sweetheart, I don't care what all you've been, all I care about is what you are. And what I am. And I'm hornier than a raged bull with equipment harder than Christmas candy, now how about you? - I've never been so insulted in all my life. - Well pardon me. - I can see you cedar scrubbers have no manners at all! - Wait a minute, wait a minute! - Honey, honey. - We're not cedar scrubbers. - What'd I say? - We're construction supervisors! (laughing) (phone ringing) - Yeah? Red, are you here? - Naw, I ain't here. - He ain't here. Okay. - You know this more fun than a regular day off 'cause we're supposed to be working. - That's right, and tonight's Saturday night, I wouldn't mind going over to the Loser's Club and kicking up my heels a little bit. - Yeah, I could go for that. - Now Billy, I want you to stay here. This is no place for little boys. - I wanna see, I wanna see. - There's nothing to see in there but a bunch of grown men acting like fools. - Oh, I just took a leak that was better than love. You know they'd make more money if they gave the beer away and charged a dollar to piss. Boy if my ass is grass, and here comes a lawnmower. - [Emma] Well this is a fine howdy do. What'd you do, get fired for sassing the boss or for doing nothing? - I got laid off, baby. - Laid off my ass. You expect me to believe that lie. You got fired good and proper. I know 'cause Harvey Jordan's wife told me so. - [Red] Oh shit. - [Floyd] No need to be mean about it, Emma. And Velma Jordan don't know nothing about nothing. That was the meanest gang boss I ever saw. - Hush up. Hush up, you probably started the whole thing, Skeets Johnson. You ain't been no good since you left Jodie and two little ones. - [Floyd] I didn't run off, she run me off with her damn sassin' meanness. You two are peas out of a pod. - Well I haven't got time to argue with the likes of you. Red, what are we gonna do? We owe the finance company. The rent's due tomorrow. My mother's sick again. Somebody stole Billy's bicycle, he's been crying all afternoon, and you quit another job? What are we gonna do? - [Red] Oh shit. Okay, take it easy, come on. Don't worry, I'll get another job. I always do. Come on, let's go home and have supper. And tonight we can go to the picture show, huh? Don't let little Billy see you like this. Boys, take it easy now, don't let your meat loaf. - We'll take it any way we can. I don't know whether to shit or go blind. (acoustic guitar music) - Where's my car? God dammit to hell, where's my car? Somebody stole it. Somebody stole my car. - Who'd want to steal your shit car? - I'm gonna call the police right now, before they get out of the county. - Wait a second man, it wouldn't even start last time you tried it. Do you got the keys on you? - Yeah I got the keys, that don't matter. They use all kinds of tricks for starting cars. I'm gonna call the police right now. - Oh wait, don't call no fucking police. - [Man] I saw them take your car away. - [Floyd] What you've seen them steal my car? What'd they look like? - I seen them take it away, alright. I was sitting there on the porch, watching the train go by, counting the cars, you know that train was pulling 68 cars, not counting the caboose or the mail car. There was 25 box cars, and 16 flat cars-- - I don't care if pullin' a thousand cars, you tell me who stole my car, you old fart. - Stop! God dammit, Steve, let's figure out what the fuck happened here, you're gonna give this old man a heart attack. Now what happened? - I'm getting around to it. Young fellas got no patience. That's the trouble with the world today, nobody's got no patience. You're just running around pillar to post, pillar to post. Got no time to appreciate nothing. I may be an old man but I've seen some things in my time. And I seen enough to know it wasn't no car thief took your car away. It was mortgage company people. There was a deputy sheriff, and two fellas in suits, and a couple old boys with a wrecker, and they hooked your car up to that wrecker, and hauled it away. Looks like you ain't ever gonna see your car no more. - Sorry bastards took my car. They took my car. If it ain't one goddamn thing, it's another. They're after me. They're always after me. They won't let me keep nothing. They won't let me have nothing. Someday I'm gonna get you, you sorry bastards, you hear me? You sorry bastards! One of these days I'm gonna have you by the balls and I'm never gonna let go. One of these days I'm gonna have you on the goddamn ground, I'm gonna throw the goddamn boots to ya, one of these fuckin' days you mother fuckers. One of these days I'm gonna stick it to you, you mother fuckers. Have mercy. (singing in shower) - What you watching? You're not gonna let that little old thing get you down, are you? - Little old thing. I'd like to know what you call a big old thing. Man loses his car, his modern day horse, and you know a cowboy ain't worth nothing without his horse. You call it a little old thing. I'm a foot, and you talk like a man oughta walk everywhere he goes. - Well listen, that thing wasn't worth half what you owed on it. And besides, you can get another car just as quick. And I'll let you use that truck of mine until you do. - God dammit, Jimmie Lee, why don't you just let me ever get good and riled up? Why do you have to be so good natured, you son a of a bitch? - Well hell, I hadn't seen anything worth worrying about lately. You wanna sit around here and bitch and moan all night, that's your business. I'm goin' out to the Loser's Club to chase up some pussy. - Well God dammit, wait a goddamn minute on me! Let me get dressed. I thought you was going like that, across my hotel. You acting like a man ought to go around naked all the time. (acoustic country music) (acoustic country music) (acoustic country music) (men making small talk) - His daughter was, a majorette, like he was, you know, I don't think his wife was, she's my, see what would Emma be? She would be my first cousin's sister or something like that. A half sister, I think she's a half sister. - Well Norma. I thought that I'd find you here. - Go away, Bubba. - I'm not going anywhere, Norma. Not til you come with me. - Look. We're through. And I'm getting pretty tired of you bird dogging me around. I got my own life now. And it doesn't include you. - Now Norma, I know that you don't mean that. I just want you to pick up your things, and want you come on get out of here with me right now. Now come on, get this, let's go. - Look, when are you gonna get it through your fat head that I ain't going anywhere with you. - Think it's time for you to hit the road, buddy. - I think it's time you stayed out of this, Mr. Hippy. - Well I'll just get into it all I want to, Shorty. (women screaming) (woman yells) (women screaming) - Floyd! You stop it, you stop it, you'll kill the son of a bitch! No, no, no. It's one thing to beat a man, you've already done that, and that's alright, booger. It's another thing to shame a man and you should never shame a man. - You boys following ahead in what I do for a living. What kind of new shit you got stirred up here? - He started it, and all Skeets did was end it. - Cause any more trouble tonight, big one, I'm gonna sock you a new hat size. If that ain't enough, my partner over there is gonna shoot you where you're real tender. - We ain't looking for no trouble. - Why don't you just keep it down to a dull roar, huh? - Alright, alright. - Think there's enough blood here to float a log. (country music) - Skeets, are you alright? I wanna thank you for what you've done for me. I really appreciate it. - Aw, it wasn't much. - Well, you wanna have a drink? Let's have a drink. - Well I could use one at that. - Hey you gave that old boy a licking he ain't gonna forget anytime soon, yessir. - Who's idea was that? - I'm glad I held onto this bottle, it's a regular whiskey river flowing down there on the floor. (upbeat country music) * Goodnight, Irene * Goodnight, Irene * I'll see you in my dreams * Stop ramblin' * Stop your gamblin' * Stop staying out late at night * Go home to your wife and family * Stay there by the fireside light * Irene, goodnight * Irene, goodnight * Goodnight, Irene * Goodnight, Irene * I'll see you in my dreams * Goodnight, Irene * Goodnight, Irene * I'll see you in my dreams - Oh goodnight everybody, y'all had a good time? We sure had a good time tonight. Y'all come back now each and every night, we'll be, somebody'll be out here. Thank you. Don't bump into the door on your way out, again. (heavy breathing) (heavy breathing) - Alright big boss? What do you think now? - Kevin, don't! (gunfire) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) - Jimmie. No. (woman screaming) Oh no. Jimmie Lee, they've killed ya. Jimmie Lee. The sorry bastards that killed ya. You can't die, we're supposed to get a job. (crying) We were square today. We killed the little bastards that, what's the difference, this fucking job. We have to go get (sobbing) (acoustic guitar music)
