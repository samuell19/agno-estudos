As a boy, I never liked summer vacations. Well, even in far-off exotic places like Spain. All right, it was beautiful, but how could I look forward to it? I mean, I was going to visit my grandfather. And although I'd never met him, I had heard plenty about him. He was old. Oh, and he painted pictures nobody understood. My mother was taking me to Grandfather, her father. She and my dad were divorced. I never knew my dad either. My mother's an actress. She was going on an adventure of her own. A new play... ...on Broadway, or London, or someplace like that. All day and all night rehearsals. Well, at least that's what she said. It was no place for an 11-year-old. I knew what that meant: I couldn't tag along. I begged her to let me remain at school during the summer. I've been attending the Boston Conservatory of Music... ...for the last four years. They consider me quite a talented pianist with a promising future. But Mother would have none of it. So off to Grandfather's house we go. I know my grandfather's eccentric. I think that translates as weird. And that he was looked after by a gruff old character named Basilio... ...who was more of a trusted friend than a servant. He said Basilio was a failed anarchist... ...whatever that is. Basilio! Oh, God! It's so... - Oh, Basilio! - Gloria! Well, if it isn't my little sweetheart. You don't know how wonderful it is to see you. And you! You! Well, you certainly didn't hurry back - since the last time you were here did you? - Basilio, I, I... - No, no, no, no excuses. - GLORIA: No! Don't try to explain. - No. Don't try to explain, because this time I have counted every minute. Uno... Well, now, now, who is this? Oh, don't tell me this is young George? Yes. Yes, I believe it is! Isn't he the handsome one? - I always said he would be. - Indeed. - Didn't I? Didn't I? - Oh, yeah. Come here, lad. Go on, you can say hello to Basilio. He's the one I told you about. Oh, what is this? No, no, no, come, lad. Don't be so shy, huh? All right, everybody inside. Come on! - Come on! Come on! - Come on, it's all right. And so the great adventure began. I'd rather go eat worms. You remember? No, no, no. Atenta, huh? You see, you didn't realize that there would be chickens in the house burros in the bedroom. Basilio! It has taken you 10 years, but you cleaned the house. Oh, God, it's just... It's all the same and... Mama's sewing machine. Basilio... Gloria! Wait until you see what I've cooked for dinner. A feast! A feast you won't soon forget. All the things you shouldn't eat... ...if you wanna keep that good figure of yours. - Where is he? - Painting. The old lock-yourself in-the-studio and-don't-come-out trick. Give me the key. - No, no, no, no. - Give me the key. Be careful. You know how he is. I know how he is. You start serving up that feast you've been bragging about. We'll be down in a minute. Yeah, down in a minute. Yes, I'll believe that when I see it. Go. Go, go. You are a disgusting old bastard. You see how you welcome your wayward daughter? Some things never change. You are a lazy, drunken son of a bitch. Hey. I love you. Oh, you're a wonderful actress. But a third-rate daughter. The critics keep saying that I'm a first-class daughter and a third-rate actress. - They're absolutely right. - Oh, thank you very much. You're painting again. Oh, I hate painting! - Where is it? - Where is what? My painting? - Your painting? - Yes, my painting. The one you promised to me. - I, I promised you a painting? - GLORIA: Yes! Never mind, never mind. It's no problem, because I'll find it. Wait, wait, wait a second, wait a second. Just... It's all right, but just, just... No, no, don't. - Please, please... Please. - Now, now, please... ...I just, just... Just look at it. Tell me. Did I catch her? Oh, yes. Oh, it's... It's wonderful. It's wonderful. You don't need me to tell you how good that is. I feel better. I swear this young gentleman carries my blood in his veins. Is that right? I think so, sir. You think so? You don't know? Yes, sir. Are you always so serious? Almost always, sir. Do you always say sir to someone that asks you a question? No, sir. Sometimes I say ma'am. Well... Come on, George, give your grandfather a kiss. Oh, now, now, come on, men don't kiss, I mean... ...not each other. Listen, we're gonna have dinner in a few minutes. You wanna go downstairs and get ready? Yes, sir. The young man is uptight, huh? Oh, you might say so, that's why I brought him to you. - Me? - Yes, you could loosen him up. Me? I, I... What could I do? See, you are the grandfather! - I know, but I, I, I have to... - Please. I have to go to New York. I have to go to work. I don't have a lot of choices and it'd be good for your character. Well, I'll, I'll, I'll try. Thank you. Madam? - GLORIA: Yeah? I've been saving these for a very special occasion. I'm it. - Of course. - Salute, Madame. - Sir. Absolute nectar. All right. Tell me the truth. Did she really look like that, with those eyes? Look. Those breasts. Your mother was... ...a much more delicate beauty than... ...much better than that. Besides, she was always changing. No painter could paint that. Certainly not me. Why is it, do you think, that no man ever speaks of me that way? I told you, baby, when God made me... ...he was horrified... ...and he broke the mold. Indeed. So, what am I supposed to do? You're my father, tell me. Marry me. I'll think about it. Oh, before I get too plastered to remember... ...will you please, por favor, senor, do a favor for me? - Of course. - And don't say anything. Please, just don't say it. Just take it. For me, please. Money. - Money from my daughter? - Please. You know, I can earn it anytime I want. I can paint a portrait! - I hate painting portraits. - Oh, yes. I know. But I can, and earn all the money I need. I know, yes. Wait, we're, we're sharing it. That's enough. Tell me... ...what is the matter with your son? He's lonesome. He doesn't seem to care about anything but his music. God, he is an incredible pianist. - A pianist? - Yes. Pianist. An actress. A painter. We're not a family, we're a circus! You're right, yes, for sure. Your mother, she loved the piano. Tell me, baby, besides all these little hassles... ...what's, what's your problem? I'm so scared. Scared. Scared of what? London. Oh, you love an audience. London will love you. I'm too old. It's too late. I don't know how I fell into this trap. Now I swear I would break my contract if I could. - Now you're lying. - No, I swear. You know, I swear you are lying! You're an actress. Besides, you're of my blood. We're made from the same cloth. - You think he's gonna stick it out? - Of course. - The whole three months? - Why not? You know, he's real different. Sometimes I wonder if he's really my kid. You only see the package. I'm gonna turn him inside out like a sock. But aren't you coming to see me off? No, no, no, I hate goodbyes. Besides, I don't wanna see you play one of your great scenes... ...Miss Sarah Bernhardt. Goodbye. George. - You behave yourself. - You be careful... ...what you eat over there. Those Londoners are very strange people. They don't know how to cook. They eat Yorkshire pudding... - ...whatever that is. - Basilio, come on! - And don't drink the water! - Come on now. I cried myself to sleep that night. Well, who wouldn't? I was already homesick. Grandfather must have heard me... ...because the very next morning... ...he took me up into the attic of the old house. And... Look out. They come in here to get out of the heat. Hello, babies. Wait a minute. George... Ta-da! - Gee, sir, it's great! - Yeah. Come on, try it. Are you pressing hard enough? Seems a little out of tune. It's, it's, it's been here for a long time. I'll have it fixed. Don't waste your money, sir. This piano's never gonna play again. Why not? Look. Most of the strings are missing and some of the ones that are still there are loose and rusty. It just can't be fixed. Well, you know more about pianos than I do. Well, I'll think of something. Gee, I really wanted to hear you play. Well... ...we'll find something. Now go back to sleep. Yes, we probably have enough to pay off all our bills... ...pay the expenses for the summer - and still have quite a bit left over. - You know, Basilio, I've been thinking. We should get the boy something he really needs. After all, it's his mother's money. And just what does the boy need? Tell me. Tell me, I'd like to know. - A piano. - A piano? A piano? Have you lost your mind? Do you have any idea what a thing like that costs? -We don't have to pay for it all at once. -Oh, someone's gonna give it to you, then! You make a down payment, then you pay it once a month. - And when, one day it's yours. - No, no, no. No, no, no piano. Now you listen to me. The only way that you're gonna get your grubby hands... ...on your daughter's money is over my dead body. Now I've got work to do. Get out, get out. Go! Go! Go! Here, paint this. Hey, sorry, Martinez. I'll stop by your branch real soon. And don't forget, I am here on vacation and I plan to relax. You understand, relax. -Don Jesus. -Mauricio. I am sorry, my friend, I am in a hurry. They are expecting me at the bank. I accept. - Accept? - Your offer. I will paint your portrait. But, but, but the, the way I want it done... ...without any of those weird things you are planning to add. - Agreed. - That's good news. Frankly, I didn't think you'd be so willing. Well, there is just one small condition. I was afraid of that. And it has nothing to do with your painting. It's the, the, the terms of payment. I see. What do you want? This piano. A piano like that? No, no. This one. - This piano? - Yes. Hey, Don Jesus. Don Jesus, what is the problem? Well, it, it's a little more than I planned to spend. - Well, I... - But if that's what you really want, I'll have one like it - delivered from the factory. - No, no, no. Shouldn't take more than two or three weeks. I can't wait. I want that piano by tomorrow morning. I'm afraid I don't understand. Don Jesus, you're a man who, well, values priceless treasures. No? Am I right? - Yes, you are right. - If you send me that piano... I promise never to paint another portrait as long as I live. - Do you realize what you are saying? - Absolutely. - And make a write statement? - Yeah, whatever it takes. I'll have it registered. All right, agreed? There will be a penalty clause in case you don't keep your part of the bargain. I don't care. As long as I get that piano by tomorrow morning. Don Jesus. Oh, you drive a hard bargain. Come on, come on, you. Don't move! I'm sorry. Just, just, just hold the position. Now... Hello, George. What's the matter? I couldn't sleep. Hello. I'm Teresa. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. This is George, my, my grandson. What are you doing, what are you doing, what are you... I think it's better if I go upstairs. -No... -I'll wait for you. You never saw a naked woman before? No, sir. What do you think? I don't know, sir. I'm not sure. You don't know? You'd better start forming an opinion. I'll try, sir. Can't you say Pops instead of all those sirs? Yes, sir. Well, come on then, then say it! I will, sir. To bed. Hey! What are you doing there? Get out of there you little degenerate, go on. The kid? Oh, good God! Why didn't you shut the door? Where do you think you're going? To get out of this mess. George? George? Open the door. George! George, please. Pops wants to say something to you. George, Pops can explain. Oh, God. What, what, what can I say to him? I know, I'll tell him we were playing some kind of game, huh? Maybe... What do you think? I think that's not gonna help. Do you have to make so much noise? Can't you control yourself? I make so much noise because I feel like it. And you like when I make so much noise. You've said so a hundred times. Who asked you? No, no, no, not right now. Get dressed. - Now? - Yes, right now! And go home. It's raining! Get an umbrella. After everything we've been through together. It'll be a cold day in hell before you see me in this house again. Oh, to hell with it. - Who is it? - It's George! Come in, come in, son. Good morning, son. Good morning, sir. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were painting but I would like to talk to you. Yeah? About what? I would like to go back to the, the conservatory. It's the summer vacation, isn't it? Well, sir, the dorm's open all year. If you have your family's permission students can stay there the whole time. I think I can make better use of my time if I go back too. Have you packed your bags yet? No, sir. That's all right. Basilio can help you. Well, we'll need some plane tickets... And seems you're traveling alone, aren't you? Yes. And then, of course, you'll have to call your mother. Me? Yes. Not up to me to convince her. Then... You can get away in a couple of days. Are you, are you happy? Yes, sir. Can you stay with me a couple of more days? Of course, I can, sir. No, no, no. But, mister, how can I make you understand? You don't have to pay anything. Oh, sure, that's what they all say... Then they murder you with monthly payments. Like I said before, it's a present for Don Mauricio. Oh, he told you to say that, didn't he? What kind of an idiot does he think I am? Well, I don't believe it. Nobody gives away anything for free. Especially a thing like this. Pianos are worth a lot of money. You can just take that thing away from here. Get out of here. Alla, alla! Alla, alla, alla. Basilio... -They say this is a present. -It's not a present. It's an exchange. For a... For a portrait. What do you mean? From now on you're gonna get paid with pianos? -Where are we gonna put them all? - This is for the boy. Oh, so, what am I supposed to do when I go shopping? Pay for food with piano keys? Oh, come on. Come on! Bring it in. That's it. Push! Is it a good make? Oh, it's one of the best, sir. Well, come on, come on. Try it. May I? Son, it's, it's here for you. Is it in tune? So far, so good, sir. Well, come on, play us something. What do you think of my grandson? He plays like an angel. Someday you're gonna be a great pianist. Thank you, sir. Someday... ...I'd like to become a composer. You know, he's right. A pianist follows notes, a composer follows his imagination. Allows it to fly. Well, can I play a song I wrote? Oh, I'd love that, son. Come on. Well, did you like it? - Did you compose that? - Yes, sir. - Senora. - Nice to see you. You haven't come close to me lately. Better get the tickets here. - Did you call your mother? - Not yet, sir. What do you mean, what do you mean, not yet? You should call her. It's closed. I forgot it was Tuesday. We'll have to come back some other day. Come on. I'm gonna take you a different way. Beauty... All right, come on. - Beauty... And energy... - GEORGE And energy... Come into me! - Come into me! The energy of nature. You can almost reach out... ...and grab it in your hand. That's what man is all about, energy. To be alive... ...with a purpose... ...to what's ever a target in your mind. Now you listen to me... ...always have a target here in your head. You understand? - I think so, sir. - Well, that's more than I do. Let's try that again, huh? Beauty! Come on, come on! - Beauty... - Beauty... - And energy... - And energy... - Inside of me! - Inside of me! Well, that's good. - Hey, don't you feel better? - Yeah. That's right. Come on. I don't think my grandfather would ever admit it... ...but he's really a nice old geezer. And even though he's probably at least 100 years old... ...or something close to it, he's still in love with life. He still has the power to see and the power to sing... ...the power to create. He's teaching me to love everything beautiful in the world. And, yes, to love him too. I'm in no hurry to get back to school now. I suspect he planned it that way. I can't find my grandfather. Have you seen him, sir? Oh, he's been painting. Painting, painting, painting all night. Hasn't even been to bed. Do you think it would bother him if I played the piano? No, no, no, no, of course not. He won't even notice. Do you know if he's telephoned my mother yet? Not that I know of. Why on earth would he want to call her for? You know, when he's in the mood for his painting brushes... ...he's liable to go three days, maybe four days... ...without ever leaving the studio. When I see a light coming from underneath the door... ...I know he's painting. And if the light is out... ...I take him a tray of food and I leave. I'm the only one with a key. I'm the only one who can go in. Now you, go, go, go play piano. - Thank you, sir. - Mmm-hmm. You can feel the power of nature, how it's, it's energizing, isn't it? You feel yourself growing bigger and more powerful... ...until you can almost reach out and grab the sky with your hands. And that's what man is all about, George. Big and small, fragile and strong... ...but what really matters is that he's alive. He has a purpose in life. And in the end, leaves his mark on it. And no man has the right to judge or condemn us... ...for the choices we make in this life. All that matters is your opinion of yourself. Beauty and energy... ...come into me! That will sell very quickly, and for a good price. I know several people who'll fight over it. No. The painting's not for sale. What? It belongs to somebody. Mauricio, we have an exclusive contract. You cannot sell a painting except through me. Now how much did you get for it? You owe me a commission. Bernie, just put a, a nice frame on it. Who did you sell it to? I didn't sell it! I... I gave it. Are you out of your mind? Would you like to meet the owner of the Roots For Life? There he is. Sir, is it really mine? 100 percent. Great, sir. Thank you, Pops. Did you hear that? That's music to my ears... ...worth more than any commission. Come on, son. Ok, does everyone remember what they are supposed to do? -Ready, Basilio? -TERESA: Go, throw it. Here we go. Why can't you Americans learn to play soccer like the rest of the civilized world, huh? God! - What's wrong? - Oh, a brush died. - A brush died? - Yeah, it happens all the time. Now we must arrange a proper burial. Let's find a shovel. Why don't you bury it laying down? Because this brush died standing up and it deserves the same respect. - What's that? - Flower seeds. This brush once painted exquisite flowers... ...and when spring comes again... ...new flowers will bloom on the grave... ...to honor the color this brush so kindly treated. Pops. What about the new brush? What about it? Don't you have to baptize it first? Baptize it? - Oh, of course. - How do you do it? Well, your grandfather always feels comfortable using wine... ...but today, we will use water. I hereby baptize this brush to become my friend and companion. Is that it? No, there's more. One more step, isn't there, Mauricio? Please, yes, of course, you're quite right. I hereby place you among the oranges and the reds. Become friends and tell each other your secrets. Tomorrow, it will sleep with the yellows... ...and after that, the greens and the blues. Your grandfather won't use this brush... ...until it has been properly introduced... ...to all the beautiful colors it will one day share. Uz cama negria mahu. -Ah salamia no so. -Oo salamia se. Oh, salamia... Gee, Pops, painting is a beautiful process. Oh, yes, son, very beautiful. The moment I saw it, Countess, I knew that you'd want it. I don't know. It doesn't look like his usual work. Is that a compliment? I've always known of his excellent portraiture but... ...I guess I should start thinking of him as a great artist. This painting certainly merits the distinction. I'd like to buy it. How much is it? I'm sorry, Countess. It's already been sold. Oh, come on, Bernabe. Don't play games. Just tell me how much it is. You're right, Countess, he didn't sell it. He gave it away. - To a woman, no doubt. - No, to his grandson. Really? I'm, I'm surprised. I suspect that Mauricio is suffering from an attack of grand paternal devotion. What's the boy going to do with it? I'm certain you can convince him to sell it. I'm certainly going to give it a try. Thanks. Look out! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ho, ho, toro! Toro! Toro! Hey, come back. Come back! Ole! Toro! - Ole! Come on! - Hi, boy. - Hi. Is that your portrait of Don Di... - Oh, what's his name? - Don Jesus. - Yeah, that guy. - Yep. - Think he's gonna like it? - He's never gonna see it. Otherwise, he'd have a, a stroke. Then why are you wasting your time on it? I'm not wasting my time. This is the way I see him. Here in my home, I'm... I'm free! Give me the big five! - Yeah! - Hey! You missed. The Countess is here to see you. Good afternoon, Countess. Oh, is this really that terrible? No, no, it's just a, a secret. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Oh, not at all, not at all. Well, to what do I owe the honor of this visit? I've just come from Bernabe's gallery and... - Yes. - To get straight to the point, I'd like to buy your painting. It's, it's no longer my painting. So it's true that's the new owner? Well, any future negotiations will have to be handled by my grandson. You're making this very difficult. I don't wanna sell the painting, ma'am. I'm sorry, it's nothing personal, but my pops painted it for me. It's the best present I've ever gotten. Well, you know, I'm not going to insist. I would have paid a great deal of money for this painting but I bet you wouldn't sell it for anything in the world? No, ma'am. Well, it's nice to be appreciated. Anything else I can do for you? Yes. Paint my portrait. I've just signed a document that guarantees I won't do any more portraits. - Really? - Yes. Well, knowing you, I bet you're dying to paint the portrait of the first person who comes along. Am I right? Well, perhaps. That's what I thought. I'd just be the first in line. Ok. Pops, did I do wrong? Oh, son, a man does what he must. See. I want you to see the painting I... That's the one I admire the most here. You know, he painted an awful lot of paintings, but this... One day in the middle of his life he sat down and he, he knocked this off. What's so great about it? Well, it's... ...small and simple. Yeah, but it's still just a piece of bread. No, no, come on, come on, it's more than that. Now come on, study it. Study it. I mean, don't you feel you can... ...feel the crust of that bread and it's, and it's... And it's hot? It's more than bread. It's the meaning of bread, painted with love... ...and passion. God, I wish I could paint like that. Well... Pops, what is it? Hey! - You didn't wait for me. - Where you going? What's wrong? Pops, wait for me! Where's the girl? She'd make a wonderful model. Where do you think she went? I have no idea. - Do you know her name, Pops? - Oh, no, no, no. The first time I saw her was sometime last winter. She was walking in front of me on the street. She turned and... She turned around and I... ...and I saw that face. My God, it was music. The most beautiful face I've ever seen. How old do you think she is? Well, she's, she's very tall. That face. I don't know why she keeps running away. What... What can I do to her? I mean, I just... All I wanna do is paint her. Pops, I promise you we'll find her. Yeah. Where? Hey, come on, it's not over until the fat lady sings. You know, you're right! - Hey. - Hey. Just, just, just stay still. Excuse me. Do you, do you mind? I normally pay after work is finished. It will be completed. Can you please take the jewelry off? The bracelet, the watch, the necklace? That's it. I don't know. What is it about you? You're still a countess. No, oh, no, please, look there. Look there. Come on, come on. Just the way you are now. A bottle of red wine and a glass. It's gonna be quite a challenge. The countess was always very nice to me but I don't really like her very much. I guess I'm jealous. She was taking up too much of my grandfather's time. Pops says she's a dream worth dreaming. A fair young maiden waiting to be wooed and willing to be won. I think she's an old maid verging on the desperation of sex and 60. Then again, I'm only 11 years old. Hello? Yes, he's here. May I ask who's calling? Ok, hold on. One minute. Hey, Pops, telephone for you. Coming. He's coming right now. Hey, George, look what I painted for you, huh? Well, what do you think? No, no, don't! Don't put your hands on it. It, it's still wet. From the sides, the sides. That's it. Pops, which way does it go? Doesn't matter. Just hang it any way... Hey, tell me, who's on the phone? Oh, that guy you're painting a portrait of. - Don Jesus? - Yeah, him. Hello, Don Jesus. It's good to hear your voice. You must be up on your feet if you can get to the phone. Well, I'm, I'm feeling a little better, thank you. That's good news but we mustn't take any chances with your health. I am sending my doctor over tomorrow just to make sure there won't be any sort of relapse. It's all right, it's just, just a little virus. Don't go to any trouble. Please. It's no trouble at all. We should find out what made you sick. But if he tells me nothing's wrong with you not only will I take back my piano but you'll paint my portrait! Don Jesus! Please don't take the piano! By the way, who is playing my piano? I can hear it in the background. They'd better be taking care of it. I don't want you returning damaged goods! Come on, not, not the piano. I'll paint your portrait! Wonderful. Once again, I'm delighted to hear you've recovered so quickly. Come on, Pops. Sometimes you go too far. It's all gone wrong. What is it? Doesn't capture a thing about you. Come here and look at it. It just lies on the canvas like a bad image. Where is that, that, that spark, that, that light that is yours? Maybe it isn't there. Of course it's there. Maybe your only mistake is in thinking that I am something more than my type. Come on. I can see it. I can see it now. Look at that, look at that. A candle in the wind. But my, my, my hands can't paint it! Please, try again. It stinks. Good night, Countess. Listen, I don't want... ...anybody to see me like this. Good night. "He devised a curious car..." Right there. "Actually a..." "Actually..." No. "He devised a curious car..." Pops! What's wrong? Who's that? Hey, Pops! Where are you going? Pops! Do you see her? Who, Pops? The girl. - What girl? - The girl! Go on. Go home. Why? Because I said so. Go on. George? Go home. Come on! Sir, is something wrong? Pepe, is the countess here? Oh, no, no, not now, sir. - No, no, please, sir. - I just... please, I have to. The countess is asleep! Yes, I'm here. Countess. Is George all right? George is fine. Pepe, it's ok. Then what is it? Susana, I, I can paint you now. I, I need to! Now? In the middle of the night? Right now! Please. Please. Won't you believe me? Calm down. It's all right. I believe you. All right. Let me go and put something on. Or is it part of your vision to paint me in my robe? All right. Sit down. Look, I'm sorry. Where the hell have you been? - Oh, hello, Countess. - Oh, well, come on. Now listen, I have had that food ready for hours. - I'm sorry. - Again, you let it spoil and spoil - by not showing up on time. - I'm not hungry! I always cook for you and what do you do? You let it go. Countess, would you like to cook for him? Now, now, go on, now! What's the matter with you, dumb son of a bitch? You can't talk to the Goddamn count-- I mean, I mean, the countess like that. That's the thanks I get? And after all these years? No, but you know, she's... Go ahead, starve to death. - Basilio, I... - Let him starve. You won't get any sympathy from me. Bas... Oh! All right, Countess, just wait, wait, no, no, forget about him! Just, just... Oh, you're wonderful. Now, please, just look at me. Just keep your eyes on me. Right here, right here, right here. Where did I... Morning. Look. Oh, Mauricio, that's wonderful! Is it really how you see me? Well, that's the way I see you. The rest... ...anybody can do that. Oh, no, that's not true. Oh, no, you're wrong. Painting is easy. Making a painting come alive, that's... ...that's difficult. To do that you got to get... ...you got to get pretty close to God. You got pretty close. Can I help you, young man? Is my grandfather here? Your grandfather? What do you want with him? Well, I haven't seen him in days and I've been worried about him. I would just like to talk to him. Is there something special you would like me to tell him? Special? Well, no. I'd just like to speak to him. I see. I'll tell him you were here. Good day, young man. What are you doing? I don't know. I'd like to get out. All right. Where? I don't know. Just... ...any place. Getting tired of me already? No, I've been cooped up for days. I, I just hate being idle. Well, you've hardly been sitting around doing crossword puzzles. Anyway, I have several outings planned. Darling, I don't like my days being planned. All right. What would you like to do? Just... ...go out. Lines. - How do you do? - Hello. - This is the man? - Yes. - How are you? - This is Jose Pedro Villaverde de la Serra, and that's his wife, Nuria. How do you do? - Hola. Mauricio Canal. - This is George. - Pleasure. Nice to meet you. I've heard of you. I might even have one of your paintings. There're a lot of forgeries around. I had no idea. They're worth more than the originals. Please, go aboard. Thank you. You, you... Worried? They seem to be getting along very well. It's rare to see so much life in a man his age. His age? That man could toss us both off the side of this boat with one hand tied behind his back. Did I scare you? No. You have surprised me. You are so aggressive. Why are you looking at me in that way? It's the hazard of my profession. Have you slept with him? Perhaps. And why not? He's strong, he's handsome, he's talented, sensitive and... Yes. He's a wonderful lover. You are crazy. Maybe. But I'm going to enjoy it for as long as it lasts. Do you really think I'm going to fall for that? It's worth a try. Mmm. Try again, little boy. A lovely red wine, bought for very special occasions. I hope you like it. Oh! - Mmm! That looks delicious. - What do you think, Nuria? - JOSE PEDRO: Roast lamb. Also for very special occasions. Served in a very special way for very special people. And... well, thank you, kind sir. Oh, Don Jose Pedro, this wine is exquisite. And thank you, kind lady. Mauricio seems to be enjoying it. Excuse me, can I have some more wine? Oh, no, please, a little more? Well, I toast your impeccable taste in art. I hear you have painted an incredible portrait of Susana. What? The portrait you painted of Susana. I hear it's fantastic. Oh, it's... It's ok. One day, I'd like you to do... ...my portrait. What did you say? Would you be interested in painting me? Delighted. Ahem! What? Nothing. I'd love to visit your studio. I didn't hear you. Oh, no, never mind. I'll move closer so you won't have to raise your voice. What did you say about my, my studio? I'd love to visit it. If possible. I don't allow visitors. But for you, I'd make an exception. I appreciate that. Why don't we have coffee in the other room? Yes, coffee. I'm, I'm, I'm very comfortable here. Are you? Jose Pedro, you had mentioned something about an investment. Would now be a good time to have a look at the portfolio? Yes. Mauricio and Nuria won't miss us. I suppose you're right. Was it forward of me to ask if you'd paint my portrait? No. I only paint very beautiful models. Do you mind opening that? You know what will happen if I undo this brooch? Of course. Your breasts will drop out like two pomegranates. You expect them to be exceptional? I don't know. I'm waiting breathlessly. Lovely. Lovely, lovely. Excuse me. Just... Oh! Would you mind holding this? Just... Just slightly. Just with two fingers, two fingers. That's wonderful. Do you know what? You're a perfect darling. I assure you. - SUSANA: Sounds... Mauricio, what are you doing? Nuria, how could you? What are you talking about? I am painting her. Yeah. Teresa, come on. Open the door. All right, all right! Come on. Oh, my baby. Did you enjoy your party? Oh, what a bunch of boring people with absolutely nothing to do, just talk, talk, talk. Besides... ...I kept thinking about you. - I don't believe you. - No? - Come on upstairs. - Why? Are you going to paint me? Paint you? I wanna make love to you. Oh, well, why didn't you say so? Oh, you didn't ask me. I am not a bitch. I'm not a bitch. - Mauricio! - What, what, what? I am not a bitch! Well, of course not. I'm tired of the way you treat me, Mauricio. It's time you understand. I am not a bitch. A bitch is a female dog with puppies. You have no puppies. No. So I'm not a bitch. Come on. Hi, George. Is your grandfather at home? Yes, ma'am, he's in his studio right now. Where is it? It's upstairs. Here, I'll show you. No, no, thank you. I'll find my way. When are you going to paint me? I was thinking of getting started right now. Will you take your clothes off? Right now? Yes. You are looking at me that way again. I was looking for inspiration. You understand inspiration, don't you? I'm getting inspired. Did your grandfather come down yet? - No. - Hmm. I'll take his breakfast up to him then. He's got company! Who is it? A lady. Who? The countess? No, a friend of hers. Damn women! They won't leave him alone, huh? Shall I get dressed or do you want me to stay like this? Oh, whatever you want, darling. Should I put something on? Just make yourself comfortable. Well, I... I don't understand. I thought you were going to paint me nude from the waist up. Wasn't that what you liked best about me? Oh, darling, like? I liked all of you. Then how are you going to paint me? I already did. I'm not gonna exploit your beauty on a canvas. Darling, what's, what's the matter? You never intended to paint me, did you? Of course I did, darling. I'll paint you tomorrow. - Come back tomorrow. - No. You're making a fool of me. No, no, darling, I, I, I didn't mean to, to sound like... - What's the matter, darling? - I've never been so... Don't touch me. I've never been so insulted in my life. You call what we just did, you call that an insult? Yes! Yes. Because you don't know how to treat a lady. A-ha. The new bitch. You are welcome to that old, boring bastard. Bordello! Pops, hey, Pops! Mama's back! - What? - Mama, she's back. Your mom's back? Gloria! Mama! Gloria, why, why, why didn't you call? Oh, I called, maybe 200, 300 times. You just disappeared. Maybe you were drunk, or maybe you had your hand up some woman's skirt. For instance, the bitch I just saw flying out of here. Oh, that was my model. I've been painting. I'm on a hot streak! That's the first true thing I've heard you say in years. George, honey, you run upstairs. Start throwing your stuff in the duffel bag because you're going with me right now. - Go on, go. - What is the... I thought you were in, in London. I am in London. You see, London is where I'm working for a living. But I had a day off and I thought, God, I wanna see my dad. - I wanna see my kid. - Oh, that's nice. - That is wonderful. - And here I am. And I find my son living in a fucking bordello? Bordello? You call a home a bordello? - This citadel of art, a bordello! - Don't even start! George, honey, upstairs. - Pack. Now. Please! - Mother... - Oh, Mom... - Gloria, - what, what in the world is? - Now look. This time you've gone too far. You are so wrong. That boy and I, we're, we're friends. We're pals. He loves me. Of course, he loves you. Who could resist you? You blind people with your charm, you seduce them with your genius. And the vile part of it is you know exactly what you're doing. Oh, now it's out of your, out of your mouth. You've joined all those idiots who call your father a monster. You are a monster! I love you. You make me so proud. I wouldn't change one single thing about you but I can't leave my son with you one more day. Mother, you're wrong! - I'm not gonna go. - George, George... You obey your mother. I'm not gonna listen to her. I don't wanna go. Now you shut up. George... ...she's your mother. You, you, you have to do what she says. She wants you to pack, you... ...you go and pack. I don't wanna leave you. That's the greatest present you could give me. But you go. Go and pack, like a man. Where did I go wrong? George! George! What are you doing here, huh? Nothing. Come on! A man like you doesn't cry like a baby. - Pops. - Huh? I wanna stay with you. George, your mother is right. The time has come to go. It's all in that painting I gave you. Come here. The lessons you learned here this summer, I mean, I... They're, they're important. But we, we did have fun, didn't we? Now the time has come for you to climb higher and higher until you reach the sky. Until I can grab the sky with my hands? That's right. Oh, remember? - Beauty and... - And energy... ...come into me! Oh, that's wonderful! Wonderful! - When will I see you again, Pops? - Oh, we'll meet again. One day, you will get a message. Just one word. Come. And no matter where you are in the whole world, you will come? Yes, Pops. Promise? I promise. Until then? Until then. Twelve years passed. Both my mother and Basilio sent me secondhand reports about my grandfather. He was always the same and yet never the same. Always steering his life towards an unreachable shore. And finding God in the grass and the trees and the flowers and the ocean and the sky. He lived as he had always lived... As a free spirit wandering among the stars. And although I didn't see him during this time, he was never far from me. Telegram for you, sir. It's just arrived. Thank you. Come. George? Teresa? George! Come in. Come in. I was expecting Basilio to answer the door. The old man died almost two years ago. Then it was you who sent the telegram? Yes. Mauricio said you would understand. Do you remember the paintbrushes you buried? Yes. And he's almost blind. - Mauricio! - Hmm? - What? - Look who's here. George! Just, just, just stand there. Let me, let me look at you. You're a young man. How are you doing, Pops? Oh, just waiting here to die. Don't say that. He's as strong as a bull. Oh, come on. You and your bulls. Oh, George. I knew you'd come. I could never break a promise to you, Pops. Sit down, sit down, son. I wanna be near you. Oh, darling, would you, would you excuse us just a minute. I wanna talk to him. Will you promise not to talk to him-- Oh, come on, stop bothering me! No, no, no, just...It's nothing. George... ...I finally painted her. Who? You know, the woman I used to chase through the streets. No. No. The one that I almost drowned trying to find? That I could never catch. One afternoon, I was in here and I... I heard a knock at the door. And I said... ...come in! You wanna paint me, don't you? Please. Come on in. I'm ready. Excuse me. I'm looking at your eyes. What color are they? So many colors. You know, I used to see you walking down the street, and I'd chase after you and then you'd disappear. I looked for those eyes in so many women. I never found them. Just... ...a little bit to the right. Just remain... And there she stood... ...more beautiful than ever. She went right to the spot that had the best light and didn't move. She didn't move a muscle until I'd finished. I never painted so fast. And so sure. I'll come back. Soon. - Pops, are you... - Oh, no, I'm... I'm all right. I'm all right. Go on, go on. Unveil it. He calls that Death. What, do you expect something haunting, frightening? That's old wives tales. Well, George, please tell me. Tell me the truth. What... What do you think of it? I think it's the most incredible thing I've ever seen. You do? Hey, George... ...that's wonderful. Well, Teresa, come here. Come here. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Listen, I wanna tell you both something. You're both in my will and testament. - No, no, no... - No, no, no, please, please... ...don't, don't tell me you don't wanna hear. Now you li...you listen. Anyway... ...you see, I've done... ...thousands of painting since I was a kid. There's, there's about 400 or 500 left downstairs. A few... ...drawings, sketches. Some of them good. Some of them just garbage! Now, I want you both to promise... ...that you'll, you'll collect them all... ...lock yourselves up in here and look at every one of them. And choose. Choose, out of all these... ...choose 10. Now, you understand that? Ten. Ten of the best. And burn and slash and, and drown and cut them and destroy all the rest! Then when the time comes, I wanna be cremated. Take my ashes and Basilio's ashes and scatter us across the sea. Our sea. I kept the old anarchist around for a reason. I want my friend with me as I begin the last journey. Now, George, do as I tell you. Promise me? Yes, Pops. I promise. Beauty... - Come on, come on! - Beauty... - ...and energy... - ...and energy... ...come into me! - ...come into me! Oh, that's very good!
