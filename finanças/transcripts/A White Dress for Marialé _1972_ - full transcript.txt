Why don't you take your hat off? How beautiful you are. Love... Marialé, wait for me here. Be a good girl. Don't go away. Where can I find Bellaria's Palace? That way. Is it very far from here? - Can I help you? - The Marquises of Bellaria await me. They await you? That's impossible. - The masters are abroad. - But I received an invitation. Here it is. I'm sorry, but there's nobody home. Take this one to the master. I'll take the other one. - Would you stop speeding like a madman? - We were supposed to be there already. Open the hood at least. This car is crap. Aren't you drinking? Would you tell me what this is all about? You're asking me that? Do you think I don't know that I'm being poisoned? I'm sick of listening to your absurdities all day. Now where did that bitch go? Absurd are only the sedatives and tranquillisers you're feeding me every day... ...which keep me from thinking clearly. Which rob me of every strength to move. Paolo, life is outside of these walls. Please, Marialé, my nerves are on edge. You hired Osvaldo to help you, not me. - I don't want it anymore. I don't want to. - Calm down. Stay calm. - Come on, quick. Hurry. Marialé, wait. Massimo, are you sure this isn't a joke? I don't think so. Paolo and Marialé would Ne ver do that. - Maybe it's someone else's joke. - Shut up. I already told this gentleman that nobody's home. But what about the telegrams? - Massimo said he saw someone. - That's true. I think I saw the lady of the house. Let them come in, Osvaldo. They're friends of mine. Look, it's Paolo. Hello, mystery man. - Let's go. - So I was right. That's droll. You saw that? He didn't want us to enter. Wait for us, please. I'll wait for them. You leash the dogs. - What an effort to get here... - Are you alone? No, these two pigs are fighting back there. Think about what you're going to say before you open your mouth. I don't like the way you treat me in front of your friends. Open your mouth only to smile, it's prettier. - A lot of steps. - This is Semy. - There are limits, for God's sake. - Also to your debts. - Look who's talking. - And Mercedes? - No. Don't drag her into this. - Are we talking about her? It's me and my reputation we're talking about. Your wife put your reputation at stake. You're a hypocrite... ...an impotent, a pimp, a worm. Hello poet. Hello pawnbroker. You're good, it seems. - I'm not sure about me yet. - Come in. - How many are still to come? - Three more. Wait a moment. - Well, are we going or not? - Come on, you fool, come on up. - Alright, we're going. - Look at him. - Marialé will be happy to see you. - You think so? Yes. Come on in. Excuse me for a moment. I'll go check if Marialé is ready to come down. Please, help yourselves. Well, something doesn't add up here. - If you ask me, they didn't expect us. - If that's so, I'm out of here. You could be more careful. I'll take care of it. Did you send out these telegrams? Yes, I broke the lock on the phone and dictated them. Do you have any idea what situation you put me in? I realise that. But don't start arguing again. Alright, but tell me what you're planning to do now. This should be fine. It's a little out of fashion, but I don't have anything better. I asked you a simple question. Would you care to answer me? And I asked you to stay calm. We have to live a normal life again, amongst other people. No matter if they are good or bad. Just to live. I want to hear other voices. I want to see other faces. Now they're already here. It will be difficult to throw them out. Don't you think I'll take part in your party. Are you afraid they'll find out who you are? The things you do to me? How we live? - I'm only afraid for you. - Stop it. I don't want to harm you... Be quiet. Alright. Have it your way. Shall we come to some arrangement? I'm listening. You behave yourself, and l... And you...? - This is not a game. You have to realise... - it's a serious matter, I know. But for them it will be just one of those stupid evenings they've spent many a time before. They won't give you what you want from them. You don't know that. These are people we haven't seen for a long time, for years maybe. - And they're no objects. - That's what you say. And you can't use them like objects. They're pathetic, hypocritical, gutless, jealous and unstable like everybody else. You'll see, you just need to get them into the right situation at the right moment. Stop drinking. Is my laughter fine like this? Shut up, you little monkey. You should stop saying these things to me in front of the others. - And you should stop drinking. - You're right, Semy. Mind your own business, poet. What did your husband tell you? You're a pig when you are like this. And also a racist. But she learned to walk only yesterday. Sure. Because people like you have cut off her legs. What are you doing here in the midst of all that dust? I don't really like these people out there. But you came with them anyway? I came for you. Do I look different from the last time? - You haven't changed. - Yes, I did change. - I'm married now. - Yes, I forgot about that. Massimo, I need you. - I need your help. - I'm here. No... it's nothing. Excuse me. Don't move, Mercedes. Stay calm. Could you explain to me how it managed to get in here? I caught it earlier in the park... ...but then it slipped out of my hands. It's harmless, however. There are more poisonous bites than the ones from that snake. Tell me, are you always armed? Well, we live here alone. Take it away. That's fantastic... Serpents... telegrams that nobody ever sent... ...servants who play the three wise monkeys: I can't see, I can't hear, I can't talk. An uninhabited castle. All that's missing are ghosts. Shut up. Yes, white man. At your service, white man. Enough. - Here are your ghosts, Semy. - This is not the time for irony. Well, let's take a tour of the castle. There's not much to see. Half of it lies in ruins. What's your name? My name is Semy. Come with me. If the ghosts want to follow us, they're welcome. Not bad for a start... Be careful. You might be in for a surprise. You're really mad. You know, Semy was trying to seduce this armour. Take a look at this crossbow from the 16th century. Who's there? Who's in there? You never know... Come on, Jo, answer me. Please, Jo, don't frighten me. ...answer me. - Mercedes, what happened? - There was someone there. - I thought it was you! - Wait here. I'll take a look. Calm down. Don't be afraid. There's nobody there. You're lost? This is a real labyrinth. I told you there was nothing to see. People always think there's something extraordinary about a castle. Now here's the proof that that's not true. How many times have you been down here? Two or three. However, these cellars do have a history. These walls heard the cries of prisoners. In some corner somebody probably committed adultery. Masters and servants have frequented these tunnels thousands of times. Something must be left of all of that. It's useless to bolt the doors... ...in order to hide the traces of the people who lived in this hell. - Don't you think so? - You're right. Marialé, don't insist. Dinner is probably ready. We're not finished here yet. Besides, there are no lights down here. There are candles. - But what do you expect to find? - Nothing. As you said. - Then I will tell you what's underground. That's not all. Marialé, where are you? Where are we, Marialé? Close the windows. Where are you? All of you get out. Get out, everybody. Get out of here! But that's Sebastiano. No way. It's a mannequin. - You seemed fake. - How do I look? He's real, though. You fool... Nobody would have ever recognised you. Marialé, that's a game you better not play. A game. A good idea. What are you waiting for? Come on, pick a dress. - Come on. - I'll choose... ...that one. Fine. Change clothes, disguise yourselves and put some make-up on... Do whatever you like. I'll be waiting upstairs. - Which dress do you recommend? - The one you would never wear. I'll take this one. I'm ready. Why did you choose that dress? Because it becomes me. Marialé, what's really on your mind? Take and eat: This is my body. Truly... Truly I say to you... - ...one of you will betray me. - ...one of you will betray me. It isn't me, is it, Lord? Drink. - Come on, drink. - Drink. Come on. - No, I've had enough. Enough. How cute. Where did Semy go? Turn off the lights and let us play. It was fun, wasn't it? Lock the cellars. Why have you invited us? What's the goal of this masquerade you set up? Don't laugh, this is a serious matter. But I haven't set up anything. I'm not interested in Semy and the others. There could have been other ways to bring us all together here... - ...but instead... - I wanted to see you again. Answer my question. - I'm scared. - Of what? - Paolo must be looking for us. - Answer me. Come on, let's go. - Come here, Mercedes. - Where are you taking me? - Where are we? - Come on. Be careful. Here we are. Come here. Undress yourself. - Come on, undress. Come on, nobody's here. I don't want to... - Come here. - No, let go of me. Not like this. What's your problem? Stop it. Enough. - Marialé, what are you doing? Why? - Mind your own business, idiot. What's going on? What's happening with everybody? Now, what does he want here? You shut up. Shut your mouth with your idiotic talk and your dirty kisses. And you? What were you doing down here watching? She's my wife. Your wife? "Your slave" is what you wanted to say. Your servant. Your mistress Perhaps. An item for sale. An object of trade. You impotent wretch. You haven't changed, right? Look at you. You think you're less ridiculous than everyone else? Half Hamlet, half balladeer. It was a game, and it has to remain a game. That's what you think. It's not enough to switch on the lights to make everything go back to how it was before. Isn't that right, court jester? And you, Jo, why did you slap her? An old general without an army. The master commands... ...and the servant obeys. It doesn't matter if all of it is unjust and absurd. Isn't that right? Why don't you open the door, you bastard? Move. Calm down. It's all over now. Come on. Let's go. But why should I do that? Semy is my girl. I heard her scream, so I ran. I heard her hands scratching the door, and tried to open it, to break through. It was Osvaldo. The butler locked her in there. He wanted to take vengeance on those who snoop around his filthy beasts. Even if that was true, you could have simply opened the bolt. - Why didn't you do that? - I didn't see it. It was dark. And then Semy screamed... And you just trembled. Luckily, it seems she got a hold of herself. Unfortunately, Marialé is now very upset about everything that happened here. It wasn't pleasant for her to see you in your, let's say, "exhibition". - And neither for me. - Listen... ...it was her who invented that game. However, it is obvious that our presence here is no longer appreciated. We behaved like pigs. I'm not sending anybody away. What a pity, a weekend gone bad. Well, there's nothing left to do but packing our stuff. What do you want in here? - Wait a minute, Semy, wait. I wanted to say... - Get out of here. - But... l didn't do it. - Get lost. - I didn't want to... - Get out. We mustn't touch anything. Did you see anybody? Think again. - Nobody. - A noise? - Nothing. - A shadow? A scream? A voice? Enough. What happened, Paolo? Go get a sheet. Come on, what are you waiting for? - We have to call the police. - The police... it's easy for you, but try to understand... But what's there to understand? Even you have to realise that a crime can't be hidden. We'd make ourselves accessories to murder. Aside from being accessories... we could all be incriminated. Not me. Semy can testify that I was in her room at the time of the murder. And you know when it happened, you idiot? This is not about your innocence or mine, but why he was murdered. But I don't have any motive. You and Mercedes maybe... - Nobody accused you. - Let him finish. The only ones who might have hated Sebastiano were you two. He took advantage of the relationship between me and Mercedes. - Precisely. He blackmailed you. - So I got rid of him. Sounds logical. But it wasn't like that. Listen, Massimo. Mercedes, Sebastiano and me... ...have decided that it was a good thing. It might have looked like a dirty, ambiguous relationship to you... ...but we all accepted it. - So it was Mercedes. - Stop it. Cut it out. It's no use to anybody if we tear each other apart. None of us would confess the murder. Every minute that passes makes the situation worse for all of us. I'm sorry for Marialé, but we have to call the police right now. The phone is right here. The line's dead. It's been tampered with. Go to the village and inform the police. And now let's get rid of these damned clothes. I've had enough masquerade for one day. Even hypocrisy is better than this dirty carnival. It's you... Why is there no light? Why don't you do something? Relax. It must be a power overload. It happened before. - Is there a main switch? Then why don't we take a look? I'll come with you. Let's go. It's switched off. Does this also happen often? No, it's actually the first time. So someone might have switched it off. But why? I don't know. We'll ask the police. Switch it on. Don't move. Stay like that. What are you doing? I just want to get out of here. Don't make the situation any more complicated for everybody. - I don't care about any of you! - Don't make another stupid mistake. You're not going anywhere. But I don't want to end up like Sebastiano. We have to stay together. Let me go. Come on, shoot. - Don't provoke him. - I just want to leave. - Do you really think you can shoot me? - Stop it. Come on, second-rate ballerina, give me the gun... - ...and stop playing around. - No! Don't come any closer. Let him go, Paolo. 4 o'clock in the morning... ...and still no sight of Osvaldo. We can't wait any longer. Listen, either something happened to him, or he ran off. We'd be idiots to wait for the police - who he certainly didn't call. - I'll go then. We've already made the mistake of letting Gustavo go. We all have to stay here. To do what? To spy on each other? That's what we're doing. But to what result? Looking at each others' faces we're all innocent. It's blood. Jo, wait. It's pointless to go together. I'll go here, you go there. - Alright. - Don't go, I'm afraid. I have to talk to you. You need to know everything. Everything. I have to tell you something. He's tried to strangle me! You understand? He's insane. He wants to kill all of us. I'm frightened. Marialé, open the door. Listen carefully. He's mad. Massimo, please help me. Marialé, open up or I'll knock the door down. Marialé... Marialé, open the door. I have to talk to you, Marialé. Open it. You have to defend yourself. He's armed. He wants to kill us. Don't you understand? What's going on here? Where's Jo? Someone killed... Mercedes... Hold it. Don't move. Shoot him. - Hold it, I said. - Come on. - Shoot him. - Stay where you are! You too. Listen, Massimo, you mustn't believe her. - Where's Jo and the others? - They're not here. They ran off. No, that's not true. They were killed. - It was her who killed them all. - That's not true, Massimo. Be quiet. What are you saying? He's lying. Don't you understand? He wants to kill us all. We're becoming blind, Massimo. You as well. What are you saying? Only what you already know and understand. Jo has been murdered in the living room. And Mercedes... died there too. Paolo killed them. Who unleashed the dogs that tore Gustavo apart? Osvaldo, who hated everybody. Just like he does. Tell her, Massimo, that Osvaldo already left. He could have unleashed them... to prevent us from going outside... ...while he didn't leave to call the police. But he's dead. You're stupid if you think Massimo will believe you. She gave you the gun to kill me. Isn't that true? What are you waiting for? Shoot him. I want to know the truth. Massimo... l... l love you. Listen, Massimo. You can't believe that she loves you. She was offered men... ...who didn't even know what love is. Kill him. What are you waiting for? You were all there... ...and didn't know how to get out of that grotesque masquerade. It's not true. How can you love someone who offers such a bleak image of himself? - It was just a party like any other. - But it wasn't a party. Understand? What are you saying? You have all performed a tragedy... ...that she needed to hide in her childhood... ...made of bloody dolls from a murder that occurred 30 years ago. She's sick, she's mentally ill. Don't you understand? She's insane. I was there. I loved him. I loved him so much... - But it happened 30 years ago. - Me and you, Massimo. Then... Why did he do it? It was your father. I used to kiss him... ...like this...
