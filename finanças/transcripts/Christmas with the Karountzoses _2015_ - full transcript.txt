- [Michael Voiceover] My name is Michael Karountzos. From as far back as I can remember, there was one thing I really wanted to be when I grew up. A great father. I wanted to be the dad that never missed his kids' games, always tucked his kids in at night. And above all else, provided his children with everything that they would need to get by in this world. In my third year of college, I had to drop out to support my dad's restaurant business. I bounced around to a few jobs, and that's when I met Tiffany. At a wedding no less. Before long we had a few kids, and I settled into my job at ICG as a systems analyst. As time went by, my dream of being a great father seemed to slip further and further away. To my regret, I had to spend more time at work and less time with my family. But after 18 years, I finally got the break I needed. I had applied for a position of Regional Vice President of ICG. Our family would finally be able to breathe, and most importantly, I was gonna be able to put my first son through college. My friend, Disco Dave, told me that he'd seen the paperwork so, all that was left was for me to get that call and act surprised. But that's where God intervened. You see, in these hard times, we cut back on so many things. Food, gas, clothes. And unfortunately one of the other things was God. And on this Christmas Eve, God came looking for me. Except, I had no idea it was him, because it all began with one simple thing. Tiffany, have you seen my cellphone? - [Tiffany] Did you check your coat? - Yeah, and that's, I can't find it. - Yeah, well, you sit right there. [laughs] I have two gifts for you. - Shouldn't there be a box, or some gift wrapping? Something, no? - No. You ready for the first one? - Oh honey, you know what? I just realized, I left my cellphone on my desk at the office. I gotta go back and get it. - Oh, no, no, no. No work today, no. Your relatives are gonna be here in a couple of hours. - Honey, you know what? The promotion's coming in and that cellphone, I gotta get it. I will be back in one hour, I promise you. Hey, Jeff. - Oh, dad. Can you help me with my homework? - Not now, I gotta get to the office. - On Christmas Eve? - Yeah, I left my cellphone there, and the promotion call is coming through on that. - Well, I just need help writing a few paragraphs on what it means to be Greek. - Oh, Jeff. No, no, I'll help you with it when I get home, I promise. I gotta get to the office. [sighs] - That's what you always say. - Hey dad, what you doing? - Just finished installing the surveillance cameras. Anything moves around the house, Papou sees it. - Dad, this isn't about those religious groups that keep coming to the door, is it? - I told them, this is Greek Orthodox house. Stay away from here or you have big troubles, mister. - [laughs] Lance, keep an eye on him. - Oh, you're still here, good. Can you drop this prosphora over at the church on your way home? - Oh Honey, no, no, no, I don't have time. - [Tiffany] No, no, no. Father Tom said he really needs that. - Okay, I got time. - Just give me one sentence, please. - Oh, your cousin Telly called. He said that he can make it. - Telly? Why did you invite Telly? - You said to invite all of your relatives. - You have a cousin named Telly? - I got a cousin named Telly. He's a tow truck driver. [singing in foreign language] - Who needs a tow today? - Why haven't we met him? - [Michael And Papou] Lulu's loukoumades. - Lulu's loukoumades happened 15 years ago, it's time to bury the hatchet. - Does he still have that fake Greek accent? - Michael. - No, no, seriously. The guy has lived in America for 40 years, and still has a thick Greek accent. All right, guys. The phone call's coming at three. Love all of you. - [Tiffany] Love you too. - I'll be back, bye. Oh hey, Koslowski. We're having some of my relatives over tonight for a Christmas party. Just in case it gets a little loud. - Do me a favor, make sure no one parks on my lawn like last time. [sighs] - Yeah, sorry about that. That was my yia yia. My grandmother. She never got her driver's license. - Great, the crazies are having a party tonight. Now we gotta listen to that freaky music they play all night. What is it with these people and their music? - I like it. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - [Aspasia's Voicemail] Hi, you've reached Aspasia Karountzos, sorry I missed you. State your name, phone number, and something that will make me smile. - Hi mom, it's me. I just wanna let you know I'm getting a huge promotion today. I mean, well, it's between me and another guy, but Disco Dave told me that I got the promotion, so. I just wanted you to know, I made it. And I knew that would make you smile. I love you, mom. [clock ticking] - Hey Michael, is your cellphone dead? I've been calling you all morning. - I'm here. I'm good, I'm good, I made it. - They're calling you in three minutes. - Hey dad, check out this snowflake. - [Michael] Lance, I. - It keeps moving, isn't that weird? - Yeah, guys. I'm. - Who's there with you? - [Michael] Lance, I'm waiting for a phone call, okay? - [Papou] Hello, hello, is this on? - [Michael] Dad, yes, it's on, guys. - Am I hearing another-- - Hello, can you hear me? - I can hear you fine. Lance, I told you, don't let Papou get anywhere near that Skype. - [Papou] Oh, there you are. I'm finished with my room. However, I have a spot here where you have measured the children and their hand prints. Should I paint over it? - [Michael] Yeah dad, a broker said that we're gonna be moving, so the cleaner the house is the better the resell value. So I guess just paint over it. - Am I hearing another voice, is someone there with you? - No guys, I'm sorry, I gotta go. - Okay, good luck with your promotion. - Congrats mister VP. - Bye dad. [cellphone ringing] - Oh, for God's sake. Honey, what? No, no, I got the prosphora, but it's in the car. Yeah, sweetie, the call's coming in on this line. No, no, no. I love you, I love you so. I'm gonna kiss your picture after this. I love you, but I gotta free this line. Bye, bye, bye. I love you, bye. [laughs] [clock ticking] [gentle piano music] [tense orchestral music] - [Father Tom] Finally, the Lord peered over the cusp of heaven and said, I will send My son, and his love will rest gently on all mankind, and through Him, I will be reconciled with man. On this Christmas Eve, this is the message I wanna leave you with. God sent his son, Jesus Christ, for you. - Oh, hey father. It's Michael Karountzos. - Oh, hi [laughs] Michael, you caught me testing out my sermon for tonight. [laughs] [cellphone ringing] Hold on. I'll be right back. - I really could have used your help about 20 minutes ago. What do you want me to tell my wife and kids? You wanna know why I don't come around that much anymore? - Hey, I just got the group email from Tiffany about being at your house tonight for some big announcement. - Oh. - I'll try and make it. - Okay. - So how are you doing? - Oh, fine. A little tired, I guess. - Oh, this is the prosphora, Tiffany made it. - Oh, we just taught them how to make this in our Orthodoxy classes. - How's she doing in those classes? - Well, it's been a year. She's been a great student. - Well, anyway, that's what you wanted me to bring by. I hope we get to see you tonight. [tense orchestral music] - [Tiffany] Maybe it's for the best, Michael. - For the best? - Look at our lives. We hardly see you anymore. You're working all the time. Don't you think that has an effect on the kids? And what about you and me? What do we get, 10 minutes at the end of the day to connect? How long before that starts to affect us? - How am I gonna explain this to my dad and the kids? There's no way we're gonna be able to pay for college for them now. I just wish just one time that God would have given us a break. It seems like every time we really need Him, He hides. - He hides? Michael, it's Christmas Eve, and we're not even going to church. When was the last time we went to church together as a family? I can't remember the last time we prayed together. And you say He hides? Come on, we'll talk about it after the party. - What are we supposed to say when everyone asks what the big announcement was? I mean, that was the whole purpose of inviting everyone over, is to announce my promotion. - Look, I told everybody to be here at five o'clock and it's 6:30. I doubt any of them are gonna show up. [doorbell rings] - Oh, great. Greek time. - Merry Christmas! - Oh, Ang, you made it. - Yeah! - Oh, merry Christmas, man. - I brought my girlfriend. Her name's Alithea, you're gonna love her. Alithea! Hurry up [speaking foreign language] Michael, I think she's the one. - Really? Hey, do me a favor. - Sure. - Don't do anything to upset Papou this Christmas. - Who, me? - Yeah, you know like last year, you put Tabasco sauce in his Avgolemono soup, and he went crazy. - I promise I'll be a pussycat. - Hey. - [Michael] Alithea? - It's Althea. Angelo calls me Alithea. He tells everyone I'm Greek. - She can count to 10 in Greek. - I can. [laughs] - Well, great. Glad you're here, come on in. - Ooh, it smells good in here. - I'm telling you, she's the one. She gets me. - [Michael] Really? - She feels me. She's a therapist. - [Michael] Wow. - Wait 'til you see what I got in store for us tonight. - Really? - Hi Papou. - Oh, that is so cute, they call you Popou? - Papou. - You both have a lot to talk about. She voted for Obama twice. - Who did you vote for? - Reagan, twice. - He watches Fox news all day. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [doorbell rings] [knocking] [laughing] - Hello, hello, hello, hello. Tiffany, look at you, so pretty. 15 years I haven't seen you, you haven't changed a day. [speaking foreign language] - Hello Telly. And I see you came all dressed up. - I just come from the shop. We running our special down there. If you get your car towed during Christmas, you get to drive my truck. Right on Santa's lap, for free. Couple of bumps, on the way home, whoop, whoop. Everyone's happy. You know what I mean. - Sure, yeah, come on in. - One second. You know there's a group I run with. They call themself my [speaking foreign language]. They're a little crazy, they drink too much, they swear too much, they play cards at night, but I love them. Well, I just saw them. They don't have a place to go. So I said to them, "What the heck?" Why don't I invite you too, so I invited them. I hope you don't mind. - Of course, of course. Are they here? - Oh, they're here, Honey. - Well, where are they? [speaking foreign language] - Oh. - Here's one. This is Yia Yia Haralambidig. This is Yia Yia Karetas. [speaking foreign language] And this is Yia Yia Koumaras. The three amigos. We're like a Greek Hallmark card, aren't we? - I see. [speaking foreign language] - Hello. - Hello, hi. - That's where I get the hello, hello, hello from. All right. Look what they brought you, some Greek food. We know you don't like to cook the Greek food, so they brought their own food. You're going to love it. All right, [speaking foreign language]. - So thoughtful, please come in. - There you go, there they go. The women in black, watch out, here they come. You look so good, oh. Have you had a little work done? You tell me later, you tell me about it later. Hello, hello, hello. The party has begun. - And you wonder why haven't talked to that guy in 15 years? That guy is a wacko. [doorbell rings] - Oh no, not this again. Lance! Bring my black robe that I chant in the church, and some holy water. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Hi guys, it's Christmas. Let's call it the truth. - Huh? - I believe in Jesus, you believe in Jesus. Let's break bread together tonight, come in. - We're really not supposed to, we got a lot of houses. - Listen, come in out of the cold, and I will give you shot of Ouzo, it will warm you up. And there's no caffeine in it. Come in. - Come on man, it's Christmas. - [Papou] Tiffany [speaking foreign language] This is Joe and Todd. [speaking foreign language] - Hey, did you find some more? - Camp out chairs. [doorbell rings] - Boy, you guys, you just don't give up, do you? [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - [Father Tom] Hi. - I'm not interested. [knocking] [speaking foreign language] - Oh Father, are you Greek? - [Father Tom] I'm a convert. [uplifting Greek music] [phones buzzing] - Bring me one of those boxes. Everybody, before we say the prayer, I want everybody to put their cellphone in here. This is family time. Hey, Yia Yia. [speaking foreign language] - Okay. [speaking foreign language] - Ooh, we got a gangster Yia Yia over there. [speaking foreign language] [laughs] - Father Tom, would you give us the [speaking foreign language] please, the pray. - Oh, you go ahead Papou. [praying in foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Ooh, I don't know the language, but I can feel it. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - Hold hands everyone, come on. One time around the block. [yelling in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - Ooh, popou, you fired up now. - Let's pray. - [Althea] Go on, Popou. - Lord, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for the food, and from the drink that we are now to partake of. - Oh. - And we glorify Your name, forever and ever, amen. [Althea humming] - Oh Lord, you heard those beautiful words coming from Popou. [speaking foreign langauge] - [Althea] How blessed we are to be here today. [speaking foreign language] Thank you Jesus, hallelujah. Can I get a amen? - Amen? - I said can I get a amen?

And we give honor and glory to Your divine name Jesus. Yeah. [cheering] [sighs] - I tell you, I'm tired right now. That felt like a Jane Fonda workout. - You better eat now, y'all. - Happy Kwanzaa, Papou. [uplifting Greek music] [uplifting Greek music] - Hey dad. Why are the yia yias wearing black? It's Christmas. - Yia Yia, [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [cries] [cries] [laughs] - Meryl Streep this one, huh? [laughs] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [cries] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [laughs] I told you, they're not gonna fool me. I know these tricks. I know the tricks. Come on, you three, stop with this stuff, come on. You just want a little of that scene, I know you. [speaking foreign language] [cries] - So boys, let me ask you the question. Any of you boys play the sports at school? - I do competitive diving. [laughs] - Let me tell you something. The greatest diver of all time was a Greek by the name of Gregory Louganis. You know him as Greg Louganis. - Greg Louganis isn't Greek. - Excuse me, excuse me. I don't think I heard you. He's not Greek? You need to check your history books. [laughs] He learned to dive off the cliffs of Santorini. - Well, that's beautiful. - Way up there, you know, with the donkey and all this, right? - Yes. - Up the cliffs he went, with his [speaking foreign language] by his side. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [babbles] Into the water. By the time he got to the Olympic pool, you know he looked at that pool, he said, this little pool? This is all I have to do? Dive off that board to win the gold medal? Bam, five times he went in there, won the gold medal. [laughs] He's a Greek, Michael, let me tell you. Check the history books. - Telly, you're mister Greek. - I agree. - Mister Greek? That guy makes half the stuff up. - It's Christmas, don't start a fight. Okay, just one thing, one thing. Greg Louganis is Samoan. He learned to dive in El Cajon, Calofornia. And I said it with a smile on my face. - So Michael, let me ask you a question. What's the big announcement that you wanted to make. - [Angelo] Oh yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, that. - Michael, stand up so we can all see you. - Well, the reason that we invited you over today was that. - You know what Michael? Why don't you just let me tell them. I've decided to convert. - Oh, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. The angels smile when they hear that. - That was your first gift. - Is that what you wanted to tell me this morning? I don't need that second gift, that was more than enough. - Hey boys, are you excited for your mother? - Yeah, we're gonna join too. - Oh, you're not Greek Orthodox. Oh, I didn't know that. Father, they're going to need new baptismo names. - Yeah, you can pick. - Telly, maybe you can help us choose some new names. - Thank you so much, I appreciate that. What's your name? - Jeff. - Jiff. - Jeffrey. - Jiffy, like the peanut butter? - No, Jeffrey. - Jeffrey, okay. Well, let's go over this one. What's your name? - Lance. - Lance, oh Lancelot, I like that. [laughs] Oh, sassy, I like you. What do we have here? Jiff, Lance, and Tiffany. Are you sure we're in a Greek house? I don't know. - Probably not. - For you not, I know. You don't like those names, do you? [laughs] All right, listen. Jiff, we're gonna start with you. You know how you go to the tailor, and he puts the suit on you and you try it on, and you say, "This is a little tight, this fits me good, this makes my [speaking foreign language] look a little big." I'm gonna give you a name, you try it on. You like it, you keep it. You don't like it, you don't keep it, okay? All right, now look at you. You're a young man, where you are? High school? - Junior. - Juniors, yeah. It wasn't that long ago that I was there, I know exactly what you're going through. You walk down the hallway with the backpack on and the cheeky, cheeky, cheeky man. Now, we have to give you a name. A name that when the girls hear it, they look at you, and think, "Is he the Greek?" "I don't know." "Is he the Italian?" "I don't know." "Is he the Chinese?" "I don't know." Suddenly with this new name, you're a man of mystery. You're a man of intrigue. Everyone wants to know, who is this man? - So what is this name of intrigue that will make everyone wonder what culture he's from? - Zorba. - [Michael] Zorba? [laughs] - Zorba. - Zorba, ugh, my love. I love the way that name sounds. Zorba, you see I said that name, the whole table is like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh." Let me hear you say Zorba. - Zorba. [cheering] - Zorba, what do you have to say, Zorba. - What about my brother? - [Angelo] Yeah, what about him? - Garalenbose. [cheering] - You like that one. - Hey, hey, what about our mom? - Exanthula. [laughs] - I like that. - I like it, I like it, like it, like it. [laughs] [cheering] Let's do a little review at the table here. Exanthula, Garalenbose, Zorba. [speaking foreign language] - I thought my people had some strange names. - So now we are having a Greek Orthodox Christmas, or as we like to say here, Christmas with the Karountzoses. [applause and cheering] - I wanna propose a toast. I was thinking about what to bring for Christmas. And the one thing I thought that everyone could enjoy, is therapy. I mean there's so much baggage in this family, and we gotta figure out a way to untangle this whole mess. My Althea just became a registered therapist, and she started her own practice. And I thought maybe she could give us all a little therapy. - Angelo, it's a nice thought, but I. It's just. - I think it is a great idea. - Maybe tonight after dinner. - Tonight? - Why not? - Am I the only one that thinks that's a little [whistles]. - She'll be in the library, and she can meet with each one of us for 15 minutes. And at the end of the night, she can tell us how we can straighten this whole mess out. - I always wanted to go to therapy. [toasting in foreign language] - Therapy? Exanthula? I'm sitting there trying to figure out how I'm gonna tell our kids and my dad I didn't get the promotion. And suddenly I'm in a Looney Tunes Christmas. We're gonna go to therapy on Christmas Eve. This is Christmas with the Karountzoses? - Yeah. And I think it's a great idea. This is gonna be fun. - Fun? - Uh-huh, yeah. And you want you to see the therapist too. - Not gonna happen. [sighs] - You owe me, and I'm gonna finish dinner, and then I'm off to my therapy appointment. [sighs] [uplifting Greek music] - I am ready for my session. - All right, let's get this party started. - Let's go. Excuse us, Papou. So long have you and Angelo been dating? - It's been about a year. - Really? You're gonna get married? - He better put a ring on it. [laughs] - How long you and Michael been married? - 18 years. - Are you guys still solid? - Michael and I are made for each other, you know. But, when you first get married, you have this mountain of love for each other. But as the years go by, life just chips away at it. Life problems, money problems, health problems. It's not easy to keep that mountain of love. Like tonight, you know. It's Christmas Eve, should be a happy night, right? But Michael got some bad news at work, so. I know that when everybody leaves we're gonna go upstairs and we're gonna talk about it, and we're gonna go over our finances. - See, that's the problem. - What's the problem? - Why are you gonna let world chip at you and Michael tonight? - Well, how do you avoid it? - You and Michael should come first. - Well, who can do that? You know. - I tell you, Mr and Mrs Clause, that's who. On Christmas Eve, Mrs Clause gets Santa ready, she fattens him up, she get that sleigh good to go, and the Santa gonna do his thing. Now when Santa come back through that door, you think Mrs Clause talking about some naughty or nice list for next year? Or some elves that then acted up while he was gone? She makes sure them elves is fast sleeping, they'd be. And them fairies then flew back to Never Never Land. She probably got some Marvin, some Luther, or some Teddy playing in the background. And when her man comes through that door. [clears throat] It's on. You know what I'm saying? - Well yeah, I do but [laughs]. - Hey Michael, I have to step out for a few minutes. - Where are you going? - I have to go get Alithea's Christmas present. - Now? - Yeah, I timed it while she's doing her therapy so I can go get it. - Oh, well hurry back. - Okay. - What was the last thing you said to Michael, before you came downstairs? - I think I asked him how I looked. I couldn't get my hair quite right, and my dress, I wore it last year. I didn't know if anyone would notice or even care. - There you go again. Chip, chip, chip. - What do you mean? - Own it girl, just own it. My clothes are older than me. But when Angelo picked me up tonight, I looked in the mirror. I took a long look at myself. And I said, "Ooh, I look fierce tonight." - See, I wish I could be more like you. I mean, the confidence. You know, your nails, your hair, the way you carry yourself. - You like my hair? - I love your hair. - Girl please, this is a number wig. [scream laughing] It's what's in here that makes it count. Girl, I can fix you up in no time. - You can? - I sure can. What you gonna say to your man? - It's on. - Okay, okay. That's a start. We're gonna have to get you some more swag, doll. - You know, I went to the seminary for two years. You know what they called me when I was there? The George Clooney of the seminary school. - [Background Audience] Oh, beat that. - [Michael] So why did you quit? - Well, one day, I was in confession with my spiritual father. He looked at me. He said, "Telly, you know what?" I think God gave you a talent to tow cars. - [Background Audience] Yeah! - It was like the voice of God had spoken to us. Off I went, like a rocket. [laughs] But before that rocket took off, let me tell you something. That rocket learned a few things. One of them was, you can tell just about everything about a person by the way they do their cross. [background chatter] - All right, here, what about me. - Okay, I don't see nothing. I don't see. Look, look, look, Telly. Throw the key away, I don't see nothing. [laughs] - [Althea] Give it to him. - [Tiffany] Give it, like this? - [Althea] Hmm-mm, work it, work it. - [Tiffany] Yeah. - Girl, you look good. - I feel good. - What you gonna say to your man? Come on, give it to me, give it to me. - Yo Mike, I'm your girl, you my man. 18 years, we going strong, you know what I'm saying? When the relatives go home, and the kids go to bed, you know what time it's gonna be? - Girl what time gonna be? - It's gonna be time for [speaking foreign language] booty call. - Oh, I heard that girl. Give it to me. - That's what I'm saying. I'm just trying it real, you know. - Girl. Now, when you look in that mirror, girl, what you see? - Oh, I see 115 pounds of silly dynamite. - Oh, [yelling]. - Yes. - What you gonna do with that dynamite girl? - Oh, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go, ba-bam! - Oh, ba-bam! - Ba-bam! - [Althea] Put some booty in it, put some booty in it. - But some booty in it? - Put some booty on. - I aint got a whole lot of booty, but you know, I'll put what I got in it. How exciting. [laughs] [speaking foreign language] - God bless America. - Remember, next time you get Michael alone, you tell him, it's on, okay? - Okay. - I should get back out there. I wanna everybody's tried some of my sauerkraut. - [Althea] Yes. - Telly, why don't you just show us how to do your cross? - I would be glad to. I'm gonna ask the three amigos for a little help. Let's show them, ladies. Come over here. Let me get ready [singing in foreign language] - Just do your cross, Telly. - Excuse me, don't rush genius. I'm working under the [speaking foreign language] system here. Boy, you're something else. Palm to the ground we go. This is the most humble way to do your cross. [speaking foreign language] How many times do we do it? [speaking foreign language] This is the most humble way to do your cross. You see that? She threw in a little [clicks tongue] there. I like that. From now on, I'm gonna add that too. Learn how to do your cross. - You're telling me, every time you go to church, that's how you do your cross? - Well, if you would ever come to church, you would know? - Okay, you know what? The next time I see you in church, I'm watching to see if you do it that way. - And P.S. by the way, set your clock, too. You know, I'm so tired of that one. Oh Father, I'm so sorry we're late, supper. You know who I'm talking about. They show up late for a church, they march down the isle to the front pews, like they have a reservation or something. Because they're the first ones to get the [speaking foreign language]. They go next door to the coffee social, and they grab 24 [speaking foreign language] and don't put a dollar in the basket. My God, man, what are you doing? Feeding your family on the [speaking foreign language] [laughs] I tell it like it is, don't I? Yes. - Well, I hope everyone saved some room. I made my specialty, sauerkraut. Who's first? Don't be shy. [speaking foreign language] - Tell her that if she eats this, it'll bring her good luck for the new year. [speaking foreign language] - What she said was, she ate so much food, that if she eats one more thing, she's gonna throw up. So you probably go to her. - Oh, how about you? - Thank you, no. [Speaking foreign language] - You? - Oh, she's on a low carb diet, she says. So don't worry about her either. With her figure, this one. - I know someone who definitely wants some of this. [speaking foreign language] - Dad, I don't think I've ever heard that Christmas carol before. - Hey, hey, remember what we've said about that house? - They're a bunch of nut jobs. - And? - We stay away from nut jobs. - Exactly. Oh, will you turn it down? What do you think this is? Historia? - What's Historia? - The Greek Mecca. - [Michael Voiceover] Lance, you're now four feet, seven inches. You grew one inch since second grade. Do you think you're gonna be as tall as me one day? - [Papou] Everything okay? - Oh, hey dad. I'm just, I was just checking out all the work you did. - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, no, Dad. You did exactly what I told you to do, don't worry. You know, I just wanted to see it all one more time. - Hey, let's go to show you what I got Lance for Christmas. What do you think? [sighs] - Dad, we're gonna have to put a hole in Michigan. - Why? - I didn't get that promotion today? - What does this mean? - It means we can't afford Michigan. - I'll help. - To go to Michigan, it costs $50,000 a year. - Isn't there some way you can get assistance, or a loan? - We can't get any financial assistance, because I make too much money. We've already got a loan or our home. I've got a equity line loan, we can't get another loan. - God will provide. - I just wanted to be a great dad, that's it. - Every dad wants to be a great father. And then you look back and you realize there are things you could have done better. That's okay. I made big mistakes in my life. I should have never ask you to quit college. For what? To work at the restaurant. This mistake because we always put work above everything. Now I see you every Sunday, and you go off to work. And you don't go to church. That was my fault, I set the bad example. I should never have been going to the restaurant, every single Sunday, why? Just to squeeze out an extra dollar. Money is money, Michael. But without God, there is an emptiness. The promotion? There will be many of those. Keep God close, and He will get you through every storm. - Thank you. - Ah, I forget. I have Christmas present for you, too. - Oh. You gotta be kidding. That's awesome, dad. Thank you. - Merry Christmas, Michael. - Merry Christmas. - Come on Father Tom, everybody gets a turn. - She tell me I was perfect. - This is really good. - Hey, it looks like he's doing drugs. - Mm? - Your nose, dude. - You boys don't do the drugs, do you? That's good. Telly never did the drugs. - Yia Yia, tell them why I didn't do the drugs. - I tell him if you do the drugs, I will kill myself. You come home after school after doing all that junk, you'll see Yia Yia hanging from the chandelier, dead. - [Telly] Yia Yia, [speaking foreign language]. [background laughter] [speaking foreign language] [laughs] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] Mister Drug Dealer. [laughs] - So Father Tom, what made you choose to be a priest? - Well, you don't choose to be a priest, it chooses you. - Do you still like being a priest? - I love being a priest. It's all the other stuff that's killing me. - What do you mean? - Well, when I went to seminary, being a priest meant officiating the sacraments, coming up with a great sermon on Sunday, having wonderful Bible studies. Leading your parish, no matter how big or small, to God. If you look at our robes at the bottom, there are these small tassels. Those tassels represent the souls of our parishioners. I'm responsible for those souls. That's what being a priest means to me, it's what I live for. But what has happened is, you can't just be a priest anymore. Nowadays, you're the head fundraiser. You're the one who has to break up all the fights that go in basketball games. You're the janitor, you're in charge of the Greek festival, you have to run the parish council meetings, which you dread, because you know everybody is just gonna tell you everything you're doing wrong. And you sit back and you scratch your head, and you think, is this what I became a priest for? You don't know what it would mean to me to have just one person come up to me and say, "Thank you, you made a real difference in my life." - Zorba, I'll let you in on a little history lesson here. You know who invented the game of football? A man by the name of Georgios Halas. Now, you know him as George Halas. He was the godfather of football, and he was a Greek, and proud of it. - Okay, hold on a second. We have to have a little touch of reality here. George Halas was not Greek. - Excuse me, excuse me. Georgios Halas is not the Greek? What do you think this is? A French name? - No, no, no, no. First of all, his name wasn't Georgios. It was George. And he's not Greek. Half the people you say are Greek, they're not Greek. You make it up, and you put this fake accent on it. - Fake accent? - Yeah, fake accent. Anybody can do that. Listen, I can do this. I know a guy by the name of Georgios Lucas. He made this little movie called, "Star Wars." He's so famous, he's a Greek friend of mine. - Well, I hate to break this to you. I was at the original screening of Star Wars. - [sighs] Dear Lord. - I saw Georgios Lucas, I looked at him like this, and I said [speaking foreign language]. He turned to me and nodded, and smiled. - [laughs] No, no, trust me. He was calling security. - And I can tell you just from that look, he learned Greek at the knee of his yia yia. - Okay, you know what? We're gonna make a little bet. I'm gonna bet you that I know more people who are actually Greek, than you do. First one up to five wins. But after that, everyone has to acknowledge that person, that person, as Mister Greek. - No problem. This will be over in two minutes. Don't take a potty break. Two minutes, it's over. - Okay, you say someone's name. And the other person has to guess whether they're Greek or not. - Spoiler alert, he loses. - So, are you leaving? - Well, I've put in my request. Nobody knows. I'm waiting to hear back from the bishop. - Is it just your parish that's like this, or is it all the parishes? [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] Yes, George Stanley Halas, nicknamed Papa Bear, was born into a family of, check, Bohemian immigrants. He's not Greek. Timber. [laughs] One zero, my man. - Who's computer is this, I don't trust this computer. I don't know what's in that computer, this internet. I don't know what's going on there. - I Googled it. - I don't trust the Google either. Okay, let's count another one. - Okay, are we counting Genos? - Genos count? - What's a Geno? - The geno is the someone who's the Greek name only. You know, they have the Greek name, they're really not a Greek. - How do you tell if someone's Greek or not? - You know, if you're really a Greek, there's certain things you would have done. - Like what? - Like if you're really a Greek, you probably would have volunteered at a Greek festival. - What if you, if you've had your hair set on fire during Holy Week by a candle, you're probably a Greek. [laughs] That happened to me when I used to wear it long. - What about that Greek girl on Fox? From The Five, that Papou has a crush on. â™ª Hallelujah - Andrea Tantaros? - â™ª Hallelujah - Is she a Geno? â™ª Hallelujah â™ª Hallelujah â™ª Hallelujah - Trust me [laughs], she's Greek. - I don't watch that show. - You don't watch The Five? - Are you kidding me? I turn on the TV, there's this girl Andrea. She says, welcome to The Five. Excuse me? Excuse me? [speaking foreign language] I don't think so my friend. - [Papou] So what did you do? - I gave her the five right back, and turned off the TV. That's how I do it. - It is just the name of the show. - So what? Change it to The One, or The Two. [speaking foreign language] The Five? Five, five, five, come on. - All right, all right, Genos count. We're counting Genos, your turn. - Watch this one, a little something from the side. Kelly Clarkson. - The singer? No, there's no way. She's not Greek. - Kelly Clarkson was born in Fort Worth, Texas. She's the third and youngest child of Jeanne Anne Tayler, an first grade teacher of Greek descent. - What? [background chatter] - What? What? What? Go Telly, go Telly, shift the deli, shift the deli. - [Michael] She's Greek. I can't believe it, are you kidding me? - Oh no, we're not kidding. Google that my friend. [laughs] It's Telly time, it's Telly time. Gather around children. You're about to watch a master teach a class in Greek-iology. [speaking foreign language] Oh, mirror mirror on the wall, who the Greeky Greekest of them all? Telly. It's you, Telly. It's you, Telly. It's you, Telly. Thank you. - I don't know. Maybe it's just me. Everyone told me Angelo was a player. bUT I still fell for him. - You too good for Angelo. - How long have you been dated him? - About a year. - One year? Too long. [speaking foreign language] - Okay, I don't know what you said, but I'm gonna roll with it because I like your attitude. - Thank you. - Here's mine, you ready? Everyone ready? - [Tiffany] Okay. - Tina Fey. - Fey? What? That's not a Greek name. I said no, that's not a Greek name. - May I, please. [laughs] Fey, who's real name is Stamatina, was born in Upper Darby Pennsylvania. Her mother is Zenobia Xenakes, [speaking foreign language] Oh, I think so. Say hello to my little Greek friend. [background chatter] Three, two. Or as we like to say in the [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] I can even speak to the Greek. - Oh, [speaking foreign language]. Hold on a sec, hold on. I haven't brought up my A-list, here it comes. George Michael. - The singer? - The great singer. 100 million albums sold, show the respect to a fellow Greek. - Feedback, feedback. No, I think you're hyping it too much. So I'm gonna say that's a no. - Really? Could I have the computer please? Pass it down. Careful, don't wanna ruin the moment. George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou. Hello, hello, hello, hello. I don't know, is it me, or does that sound just a little Greek? I don't know, I just say. Hey, here, three three my friend. [speaking foreign language] - So, is there anything on your mind you'd like to talk about? - No, we're good. - We're having a blast. - They think we're Greek. - I don't think so. - All right, all right. Four, four, next one wins. - Greg Louganis. I told you before, Greg Louganis, that's a Greek name. - No, he is Samoan, and you can start calling me Mister Greek. - Greg Efthimios Louganis. - Oh, excuse me, did I hear the word Efthimios? That sounds a little Greek to me. Does that sound Greek to you? - Hold on, hold on. He's of Samoan descent. - Oh, Sam-what? Sam-what? You can give me some more of that. I told you he was Samoan. - But, but, but, his teenage parents gave him up for adoption when he was eight years old. And he was raised in California by a Greek-American couple. - [Michael] What difference does that make? - Okay so who wins? - I do. - I do. - No, no, that doesn't make. - I think we have a tie. - No, no ties. Ties are for Father's Day gifts, not for this stuff. No, no, no, I play to win. You know, I made that saying up, play to win. - Telly. - I love you, okay it's a tie. And we'll have a tie breaker, and I know just how to break the tie. So we've divided you up into two groups. This is my group, the winners. There's Michael's group, the soon to be losers. I'm off to therapy. You need some help with the songs, I'll help you. I know so many Greek songs. I don't wanna brag, I know them all. But therapy calls. - Good evening ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna play a little game tonight. We're gonna play a Greek song, and the first one to guess the answer correctly will receive a point. - The first team to five points will win the game. [clapping] - So, this is the hot seat, huh? - Telly, let me ask you a question. Why you don't have no socks on? - You noticed that, didn't you? Can I ask you a question? - [Althea] Yes. - You thought it was sexy, didn't you? - [Althea] You know what, I did. - You did. [laughs] You know, and I spray a little cologne there too. Those long socks, you're there for half the day taking those damn things off. And they smell. This, oh honey, oh honey, they come off so fast. And the next thing you know, what's that sweet fragrance? Oh, come on over here. It works, trust me. By the way, they had a lot of garlic in that [speaking foreign language] if I get too close, you let me know. - I will. [far off music] [speaking foreign language] [Greek music and cheering] [singing in foreign language] - Let me tell you something. It's so hard to sit here and talk, ugh this. - Telly, Telly. We have 15 minutes. - [Telly] Okay. - And I wanna help you. - What was your question? - Why didn't you talk to Michael for 15 years? - [laughs] Well, you could write two or three books about this one. The ups, the downs, the twists, the turns. He did this, she did that. No, excuse me, no I did? Yes you did. Your head would spill with all the commotion. - Well, we've got 15 minutes. [far off music] [speaking foreign language] [cheering] [gentle Greek music] - Ugh, well, have you even been to the Greek festival? - Sure. - In the Greek festival you have the souvlaki stand, the raffle where they sell the car that, who or not, I never know anyone who won that stupid thing. But anyway, behind that is a Lulu's Loukoumades. That's my mother's name, of blessed memory. - Oh. - For 24 years she cooked all the Loukoumades. One year, though, I show up at the festival. I don't see the sign "Lulu's Loukoumades." Excuse me, I've run over to the chairman. Well, guess who the chairman was? - Who? - Mister Fancy Pants, Mister Michael. Michael, where's Lulu's Loukoumades sign? I don't know where it is, I don't know where it is. So he goes over and he puts up a sign, and writes, "Loukoumades." Excuse me, excuse me? Loukoumades? Did the Loukoumades just fly in by themselves? Michael, you forgot to put Lulu up there. He goes running up there, and writes in crayon, "Lulu," while I counted all the people that had Loukoumades that night and I never saw my mother's name. You know how many it was? - How many? - 18 people had Loukoumades that night they didn't see my mother's name. - Okay, so what happened next? - Next? What do you mean next? - Telly, you said the twist, the turns, what happened? - That was a twist and a turn. Were you not listening to the story? - For real? You mean to tell me, you didn't talk to Michael for 15 years, because of the Lulu's Loukoumades sign? - That's right. I tell him, you forget to write her name up there, I forget to talk to you the rest of my life. - So what made you come tonight? - I have a good heart, you know. I'm not like all the rest of these Greeks, who hold grudges forever. - I can see you don't hold a grudge. - But there is one other small part of the story that I left out. - Telly. [far off music] - Hold on. [farting] [laughs] That was just the, that was the garlic going out the other end. That's part of the magic of Telly, the good and the bad, the good and the bad I say, okay? You know, but when the next one comes in, I'm gonna blame it on you. [lively Greek music] [laughter] - So Michael, how's the work these days? - Oh, it's fine. - You're still working at ICG? - Yeah. - [Father Tom] Now, what do you do there? - I'm in systems analysis and product development. - System what? Whatever the heck that is. - Michael, you should own that place by now. You work there for so long. - Come on Michael, you're next. - Uh oh, here she comes to the rescue like the lone ranger, Althea, hello, [speaking foreign language] You know, Michael. All right Michael, do your thing in therapy. - So how's your Christmas Eve going? - Oh, I don't, I don't know. - What's going on? - Well. I really appreciate your offer, and I know you mean well, but I really don't even know you. - I never know anyone before I speak to them the first time. - I guess that's true. - Do you still live in Greece? - Greece? [speaking foreign language] I live here in America for 42 years. - Then why do you still have an accent? - I have an accent? You have the accent my friend. I get so mad when people make fun of my accent. You know, I've gotten into fist fights over that. Yeah, like, oh, let's see, let's see. You go to the Greece, let me tell you something. They all talk like us, with this accent. Am I right? - Right, right. I have 57 years, and I have an accent. - There you go. [laughter] - I love his accent. - Me too. And me too. - So, my time up? - Why are you so edgy? It's Christmas. - I'm edgy? - A little bit. - I don't, I don't know. Just. Anyway, thank you. I think my time's up. - Your wife knows you well. - What do you mean? She said you wouldn't even try. - Tiffany said I wouldn't try? I was supposed to get a promotion today, and I didn't get it. I mean, I wish I could smile today. But I, I know the problems tomorrow's gonna bring. I'm just so mad at myself. I keep thinking, "Michael, how did you end up like this?" Struggling to pay your bills, trying to keep your nose above the waterline. You can't put your kid through college? What's wrong with, what kind of a man are you? - Hey, you're a good man going through some bad times. You keep your head up, okay? - I just keep going back and think, how did I mess my life up like this? I don't know. - I'm gonna try something with you. I want you to write a letter. - A letter to who? - Yourself. I want you as an adult to write a letter to Michael as a teenager. I want you to give him your thoughts and wisdom about how to handle life up ahead. - Okay, I just, I pick any date or something? - [Althea] How about your 13th birthday. - I remember that day. - Good. - I'm gonna go see what's going on out there, I'll be back in a few minutes to check on you, okay? - Okay. - So I was wondering if you could help me with my sociology paper. - What's the topic of this paper? - What it means to be Greek. - How long can this paper be? - No more than three paragraphs. - Three paragraphs? [speaking foreign language] They've written books about Greece, not just three paragraphs. This tiny country, Greece, has changed the whole world. They say, "Telly I think you're making it up." No I don't. Democracy, the Greeks. Philosophy, guess who? The Greeks. - Literature. - Guess who? The Greeks. - Bankrupted Euro. - Guess who? The Greeks. - Don't pay any attention to them, the wise guys over here. Science, the Greeks. Mathematics, the Greeks. The most important one of all, the English language. That's why it's so important that you go to the Greek school. You do go to Greek school, don't you? - We dropped out of Greek school. - Oh, oh don't say that, don't say. I don't want you to be known as a Greek school dropout. - Why, what's wrong with that? - You know, I used to teach Greek school. We had a song for the Greek school dropouts. If you hit me in the key of C, I'll sing it for you. [gentle piano music] â™ª Your studies, sad to tell â™ª Couple of Greek boys, â™ª not [singing in foreign language] well â™ª â™ª Most mixed up [singing in foreign language] â™ª â™ª On the block â™ª Your future's so unclear now â™ª Your cousins think you're weird now â™ª â™ª Can't even get a job in a Greek restaurant â™ª â™ª Greeky school dropout â™ª No graduation day for you â™ª Greeky school dropout â™ª You're an embarrassment to Yia Yia and Papou â™ª â™ª Well at least you could have taken time â™ª â™ª To try and be another boy â™ª If I was a Jewish grandmother â™ª â™ª I look at you ans just say â™ª Oi [laughter] â™ª Of us get moving â™ª I think you're the reason Yia Yia may die â™ª â™ª What are you doing [singing in foreign language] â™ª If you go to [singing in foreign language] â™ª They'll think you are a fool â™ª Turn in your mind change â™ª And go back to Greek school Hello Alithea, my Greek sister, dance with the [speaking foreign language] â™ª Greeky school dropout Oh, I love it baby! [singing in foreign language] â™ª Greeky school dropout [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] â™ª Well, they couldn't teach you anything â™ª â™ª They didn't want you [singing in foreign language] â™ª You're worse are bad at Greek school â™ª â™ª They kicked you out of the choir â™ª [singing in foreign language] â™ª Don't blow it â™ª Don't put my good advice to shame â™ª [singing in foreign language] â™ª You'd know it â™ª Even Father Tom says the same â™ª â™ª Now I call the shot â™ª Get off of the pot â™ª Cause I really got to fly [speaking foreign language] â™ª Got to be going to Greece on â™ª Olympic Airline â™ª Hit me boys â™ª Oh, shake it, don't break it everybody. â™ª â™ª Greeky school dropout â™ª Go back to Greek school â™ª Geeky school dropout What about Jiffy, where should he go? â™ª Go back to Greek school â™ª Greeky school dropout â™ª Go back to Greek school [clapping] Thank you so much. [speaking foreign language] I'm here all week. You know, they call me the Greek Pavarotti when I was a kid, but forget about it. I don't want to brag, I don't want to brag. - Why don't you read to me what you got so far? - Dear Michael, well your 13th birthday didn't quite turn out the way you thought it would, did it? A lot of tears were shed last night. I know you won't believe me now, but getting cut from your seventh grade basketball team is gonna be one of the best things that ever happened to you. You don't realize it now, but tomorrow you're gonna wake up and volunteer to be the manager of your team just so you can be around your friends. You'll be getting them towels, bringing them water. It'll be a humbling moment for you. I'm proud of you that you did it. Even though people are gonna make fun of you, don't get discouraged. I promise you this. Those people will call you two things before you finish high school. Champion and captain. College will end differently than you'd think. Your mom and dad will feel like they let you down. Michael, don't make excuses. You help them out, it was the right thing to do. Now there is one really great thing that's gonna happen to you when you go to your friend's wedding. The only thing I'm gonna say about it, is when your friend John tries to get you into leaving that wedding early, do not do it. You keep, you keep your eyes fixated on the gift table. 'Cause right about that time, a young woman's gonna walk up to that table. Your life's gonna change forever. You'll know it the moment you look into her eyes. You're gonna see the other half of your soul. Treasure her. Love her. God gave you this gift, don't blow it. One last note, in your young age, you never think about losing your mom and your dad. But eventually everyone does. It's one of those painful facts of life. When you lose your mother, you feel like you lost your best friend. The person who understands you the most, loved you the most, cared for you the most. All of that's true. But try and remember, we believe there is a heaven, and someday you're gonna see her again. You have my word on it. Well, I'll say bye for now. I'm gonna live the last chapters of my life. I've made some mistakes, but don't worry. I'm gonna make it right for you. The best is yet to come. Michael. That's it. - When did your mom pass away? - It was about five years ago. You know, she. She would always say to me that she felt bad about the fact that I had to drop out of college to help them with the restaurant. She said, "I just wanna live long enough, to see you become a success." But, you know, God took her before that could happen. - [Althea] Pretty angry with God, aren't you? [breathes deeply] - I think I've been angry with God since she died. - And losing that promotion today didn't help, did it? - Yeah, I mean. [sighs] I know my mom is in heaven. And I think if I had gotten that promotion, somewhere in my mind I felt like her soul could rest. - You know, I lost my mom. - Really? - You never stop thinking about them, do you? - She was my best friend. I could call her about anything and she, whatever it was, if it was something good happening, or something bad happening. She always knew the right thing to say, you know, that, that. That would either, you know, guide me in the right direction or make me laugh, or whatever it was, you know. She just . I. I just wish I could pick up the phone and just talk to her. You know, that's. I just miss, I just miss that. I mean, it's goofy. But I actually her answering machine now. And just so I can hear her voice on it. Does that seem weird? - Absolutely not. Everyone grieves differently. You don't wanna know what I do. [laughs] To remember my mom. - I know one of these days I'll probably stop doing it, but. - When the time is right, you will know. - I just feel like for these last five years since she died. I've been trying to get that promotion, putting in so many hours. I just feel like my you know, my kids and Tiffany, they haven't gotten the best of me. - Oh, that can all change. It doesn't take much. You'd be surprised. - Thank you. - Thank you. [singing in foreign language] - So Popou, what have you been doing since you retired? [snoring] - [Michael] Hey, you want some help with that? - [Tiffany] Sure, why not. - That was a great Christmas gift. - Thanks. You know I'd hoped to give it to you in private, but. - Work got in the way. I know I've gotta change. - I just want my old Michael back. The one who used to goof around and not take life so seriously. - I know. Tiffany, I would do anything for you. I would. - You said those same words to me on the night we got married. The title of our first dance? Barry White song? - Oh, Honey, it was 18 years ago. I got a lot on my mind. I still mean it, though. - I hope so. [energetic music] â™ª Baby â™ª Oh Baby â™ª You make me feel â™ª So real â™ª Yes, my beautiful wife â™ª Is so, so real â™ª What I feel â™ª I've got a love for you â™ª So strong I don't know what to do â™ª â™ª You're my world, my hopes and dreams â™ª â™ª Without you girl, there's no song to sing â™ª â™ª With you I can do â™ª Anything you want me to â™ª You're my girl, my hopes and dreams â™ª â™ª Without you there's no song to sing â™ª - Are you kidding me? There people are freaks. â™ª From the day we'd said I do â™ª I've been hooked on you â™ª You know it's true â™ª I've got a love for you â™ª So strong I don't know what to do â™ª â™ª You're my world, my hopes and dreams â™ª â™ª Without you girl, there's no song to sing â™ª â™ª With you I can do â™ª Anything you want me to â™ª You're my girl, my hopes and dreams â™ª â™ª Without you here there's no song to sing â™ª - Unbelievable. Someone should call the cops on these people - Maybe we should go to bed. - Who can sleep with this crazy stuff on? Yeah, yeah. Maybe we should call it a night. â™ª Girl you are my desire â™ª You set my world on fire â™ª From the day we said I do â™ª I've been hooked on you â™ª You know it's true â™ª I got a love for you â™ª So strong I don't know what to do â™ª â™ª You're my world, my hopes and dreams â™ª â™ª Without you girl â™ª There's no song to sing â™ª No, no â™ª No, no, no, no, no â™ª No, no â™ª No â™ª No â™ª I got a love for you â™ª So strong I don't know what to do â™ª [gentle piano music] [speaking foreign language] [gentle piano music] - You still love me? - More than ever. [gentle orchestral music] - Barry White. You and Michael got a little bit of freak in you, huh? - No, no, no, no, no. That was just the first song at out wedding. - Listen. When you was out there dancing with Michael, did you tell him it's on? - I couldn't do it. I mean, he was so sweet and wonderful. That was my old Michael. - Now that was not the plan, now was it, Boo? Next time you get Michael alone, you tell him straight up, it's on. Okay? Or no more Mrs Clause, ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, ho. I can do this. - I can explain. [applause] - There she is, there she is. - So Alithea, is there any hope for us? - There is. You know what I notice? You guys love each other very much, but you don't talk to each other. Do you know what a difference it would make if each of you were to admit a shortcoming and said you were sorry? Anyone wanna volunteer? - I just wanted to say we've had an amazing time tonight, but I feel like we should tell you something. - We're actually from the electric company. - Electric company? Where you from? - I think you guys saw our uniforms and thought we were someone else. - Yeah, we were just going door to door to make sure everything was okay. There had been some outages in the neighborhood. But we gotta tell you, you guys rocked. And we're coming back whether you like it or not next year. - You're invited, you're invited. - I guess I'll go next. When Michael and I first got married, some people made me feel a little like an outsider. But Father Tom, you changed all that. I remember the first time you left me a voicemail and you said that you were excited about me joining the choir. And that was the first time someone made me feel welcome in the church, and that's why I started going to the Orthodoxy classes, and that's why I'm converting. So I just wanted to say thank you for that. You changed my life. I know you probably hear that stuff all the time, but I wanted to thank you. [applause] - Father Tom, go. You're next, wheel of fortune, go. - I guess now would be a good time for me to say something. [laughs] Being here tonight has been really good for me. You made me laugh and smile, and remember what it was like when I first arrived here. I'd been thinking that I haven't really made a difference here. But you made me rethink that. I was actually thinking about going to another parish. - No, don't do that, don't do that, don't get crazy. - But you all made me realize that this is where I belong. [applause] - It gets better. Each one got better than that. - Yeah. - Who's next? - Oh, oh, that, oh. It's here this way. Okay, hold on a second. All right, well here goes, what the heck? Yes, I see you over here, look ladies we, all right, here goes. Well, the other day I was cleaning out my garage, what do I find? Lulu's Lukumades sign. Yeah, I know. So, I feel bad for this. All these years I accused Michael of losing the sign, you know, and in the end, I was wrong. Michael, I hope that you forgive me. - Oh, of course I forgive you. And I apologize to you for making fun of your accent. - Well, I accept your apology, and in the future I will try and speak better Greek. [clapping and laughing] Like you are, no like you, actually Greek, Greek, Greek, Greek, Greek, Greek, Greek. English, English, Greek. Forget about it. You. You, all right, go. Who's next? - I guess it's my turn. Couple of things I wanna say. First of all, this morning I was rushing out the door and my son asked me a question for his paper for school. And the question was, what does it mean to be Greek? And I really didn't give him an answer, did I? I'd like to take another try at it today. I heard Telly telling you before that all the wonderful things that Greece has given the world, and they're true. But there's one thing that he didn't mention that our forefathers had given us. And that is a passion for life. You know, the funny thing about Greeks, we can't just sing. We gotta get on top of a table, and then we sing, you know. We can't just dance, we gotta start breaking dishes, then we dance. And it's that, it's that passion that carries us through all of our life, but it's not only in the good times it carries us through. It also carries us through the tough times, you know? Those times when things aren't going your way. Defeat, rejection, losing. Those are momentary occurrences to a Greek, never a final destination. We always believe that we have a rendezvous with victory. Man, it's in our DNA. We return to our faith, we return our friends, we return to our family. And collectively, they hoist us up and let us set sail back out onto the sea of our dreams. That's what it means for me to be Greek. [applause] There's one other thing that I left out. The real reason we invited you all over here tonight, was that I was expecting a huge promotion. And I didn't get it. And I was just trying to get through the night without having to tell any of you about that. So, I just thought I'd tell all of you that. - Where were you three hours ago? One of the yia yias read it on your cellphone. - [Yia Yia] You should be careful where you leave your cellphone. - That's right, tell him that. - That's right. - That's right, that's right. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Merry Christmas everyone. - Disco, what are you doing here? - Michael, I've been texting you all night. - Texting me for what? - There was a delay in his flight. He couldn't get to a phone for two hours. They're waiting to talk to you right now. - Oh, no kidding, all right. - Why don't we go in the other room and talk to them for five minutes. - No, this is my family, you can talk in front of them. Go, put it on speaker phone. - Okay. Mister Dallas, I'm here with Michael. - [Dallas] Michael, sorry to interrupt there. I'll make this quick. The job of western regional president of ICG is yours. It's a 15% increase in your base salary. You'll get use of our vacation condo, access to our board. It would require you moving full time to Arizona, but the weather's great here. All you have to do is say yes, and the job is yours. - Mister Dallas, thank you so much. But there's a couple of deal points that I would have to go over with you. - [Dallas] Go ahead. First of all, I drop my kids off at school in the morning, and after that I'm all yours up until 6:30 at night, but at 6:30 at night, I got to be home with my family having dinner. - [Dallas] Done. - And if my kids want me to come to their football games or you know, they just need time to talk to dad, or have school events or something like that, I have to take time off for work. - [Dallas] Okay. - And the last point is, I need to be in church on Sundays. I don't want to work on Sundays anymore. - [Dallas] I respect that. Is that a yes, then? - Well, you know, I've gotta talk it over with my wife and my kids first. - [Dallas] Michael, we need an answer tonight. We'll increase your current pay by 25%. - Yes, we'll say yes. - [All] Yes. [speaking foreign language] - I guess, Mister Dallas, that the answer is-- - Excuse me, hold on, hold the phone. Gotta put my two cents on the table. - [Dallas] Who is this speaking? - This is Harisotella Haralamides. Who's this? - [Dallas] Who are you? - I'm [speaking foreign language] the negotiator. - [Dallas] Sorry, it's a little hard to hear you with that accent? - Excuse me? I have an accent, you have an accent my friend. - Go ahead. - Could you arrange for a couple of airline tickets next Christmas so that Michael and his family could come back? - [Dallas] Consider it done. - Are they first class? - [Dallas] We'll make sure they're first class tickets. - Oh, it's a yeah, that you see. The negotiator. Who negotiates the things around here? [speaking foreign language] Well, I think I can speak the whole table, like I have all night. Deal is done. - It's a deal, Mister Dallas, thank you. And I appreciate you calling. - [Dallas] Great. - One other thing. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - [Dallas] What's that? - Nothing, nevermind. Mister Dallas, thank you so much. You have a merry Christmas. - [Dallas] Welcome aboard, and to all of you there, [speaking foreign language] [clapping and cheering] - Telly, go Telly, go Telly, go Telly, Go Telly, Telly, Telly. [speaking foreign language] - Your mom would be so proud. [laughs] - [Father Tom] Congratulations. - Hey Father, could I borrow the keys to the church for a few minutes? - It should still be open. [gentle piano music] - [Aspasia Voicemail] Hi, you've reached Aspasia Karountzos. Sorry I missed you. State your name, phone number, and something that will make me smile. - Hey mom, it's me. Who else would it be, right? What a great day, mom. What a great Christmas. I don't know where to start. Tiffany converted, I got the job promotion, and Telly, he actually started talking to me after 15 years, what a day. You know mom, I've been thinking that you probably have more important things to do than to listen to these messages, so. I was thinking that maybe it was time for me to say, to say goodbye. And let you do all the wonderful things that I'm sure that God wants you to do up in heaven. You know mom, there was so much that I wanted you and I to talk about. And I always thought there would be another day. And I regret that. But hopefully you been listening to these silly messages of mine, and if you haven't, you and I have got a lot of catching up to do if I get up into heaven. Oh, mom. It was just such a beautiful day today. You would have loved it, I wish you could have been there. But something tells me that you were. Anyway [sighs] I guess it's time to say goodbye. [heavy breathing] Mom, I love you. I really love you. Bye-bye. - [Father Tom Voiceover] Finally the Lord said, I will send My son and His love will rest gently on all mankind. And through Him, I will be reconciled with man. On this Christmas Eve, this is the message I wanna leave you with. God sent His son, Jesus Christ, for you. - I'm sorry. - Hey guys, come here. Here's 20 bucks for each of you. - What for? - Get me a copy of all the music you were playing tonight. Make sure you put in all that soul stuff too, and I'll give you each another $20, all right? - Sure. - Don't leave anything out. - [Kaslowski's Wife] Sweetie, are you coming? - Coming Honey, be right there? Hey, what's you guys' names? - I'm Zorba. - Garalenbose. - I like those names. Strong, you Greeks are all right. - [Both] Merry Christmas. - You have no idea. - Merry Christmas, thanks for coming. - This meant so much. Thank you, thank you. - Thank you for being here. - [Father Tom] You. - You, you. What a way to end the night, huh? - Yeah, I will see you on Sunday. - God bless you, Father. - [Father Tom] Bye. - Yia Yia. - You're a great cook. - Ah. - Thank you. - [Yia Yia] You're welcome. [speaking foreign language] - [Tiffany] Merry Christmas to you, thank you. - Merry Christmas Yia Yia, [speaking foreign language] - One more. - [Angelo] Tiffany, Michael, what a Christmas guys. Group hug [yelling]. Merry Christmas, thank you so much. - And you were the life of the party. - [Althea] So much fun. I'll see you next time. - I'll see you soon. - It's on. - Hey Lance. - Hey. - You know what that promotion means, don't you? Go blue. [laughs] Papou told me to give it to you. - No way. - [Michael] Isn't that cool? - That's so awesome. - Well, Exanthula, what a night. The singing, the dancing, every. So much fun. As they say in Greece, we are now closer than [speaking foreign language] your fanny and your underwear. - It's a good thing, right? - That's a great thing. All right, give me a hug for the road. Oh, so much fun. Oh, hold the hug, hold the hug, it's cold outside. I love you, Tiffany, I love you. - [Tiffany] Okay. - Okay, oh. Oh, that was good. Okay, well listen. [speaking foreign language] Do you have one more hug in there? Forget about it. I love you. Oh, you, oh [laughs]. I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it. All right. You tell Mike I said goodbye, bye-bye. - [Tiffany] I will, thank you, Telly. - [Telly] Oh, it's cold out here. - Oh, Telly just left. He said goodbye. - Oh, you're kidding. No, he's on the phone, so. I think that was the perfect Christmas. - But I just wanted to say that when Papou and the kids are asleep, it's on. - What? - Did I stutter? It's on. - Okay, guys. Let's get to bed, come on. What are you doing? - Eating dessert. - Dessert, no, no, no. It's time to go to bed, come on, come on. - [Lance] Now? - Forget the dishes. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] - [Michael] Oh dad, come on. We'll do it tomorrow. - You must come in now. - Get in there. - What do you got for you, Papou. - My surveillance cameras recorded everybody leaving. - You're spying one everyone now? - [Michael] Come on. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [laughs] [speaking foreign language] Did you just speak Greek? [speaking foreign language] - That was your second gift. I've been taking Greek lessons for a year. - What a Christmas. [laughs] - Look, Angelo. - He's gonna propose. [laughs] [phone ringing] - Hello, this Harisotella Haralamides. - Oh, you can turn it off. Nothing's gonna top that ring, dad. - It's very funny to see this, this thing. - [Telly] No, no, no. Just finishing up the old Greeky Christmas thing, you know. Working on the Greek accent, the yia yias they, they love the Greek accent, you know. How you doing? What you doing? You know what time it is, girl? That's right, it's Telly time. You have the wrong number, don't come back here, get a, I'll call the police.
