Jd Good evening Mr. and Mrs. North and south America, and all our ships at sea, let's get a fresh flesh... -Flash! Congress today has called an emergency session, but as yet no one has shown up. And the president refuses to issue a statement, having locked himself and the vice president in his bath-room early this morning. However, the first lady urges all, and I quote, "seek comfort in the Bible," unquote. A bulletin just in, the world's top scientists are holding a conference in Washington, D.C., awaiting a statement from professor Gordon, world authority on animal behavior and renowned physicist. Gentlemen, we are in big trouble. Sex madness perils planet! Extra! Read all about it! Sex madness perils planet! Get it now, read all about it! Sex madness perils planet! Hey, scram you horny jerks! Gentlemen! As I have told you, we are in big trouble. I think there is no need for me to describe to you the incredible chaos our beloved planet has been plunged into. Of the disgrace-ful acts which are being committed at this very moment! In every apartment, on every street corner, or on the rooftops! In grass huts in the jungle, in igloos in the arctic. In airports, in markets, in movie houses, in the parks! Yes, we are in big trouble. Doctor Gordon... All of us here are aware of the total degradation that has overcome the masses, but what are we going to do about it? What is causing it? Now I say it's a virus and we must find a vaccine for it! It is not a virus, any fool can see it's a case of mass hypnosis! Hypnosis... ha! I've done research and traced the cause to cans of bad passover tuna. Tuna fish, tuna fish! This guy's got Mercury on his brain! Gentlemen! Gentlemen, we must be calm! Future generations are depending on decisions made here today. Now, I have discovered three things about this madness. Number one, not all areas are affected. Look around you, are anyone of you sexually aroused? Yes, ha-ha-hal anyone of you, huh? No! Not all areas have been affected. Number two, my son, who has been rep-resenting United States at the tenth international ice hockey playoffs in Tibet, has discovered what appears to be a great beam of light proceeding from some far off planet whose appearance is simultaneous with the first occurrence yesterday. Number three, I discovered my wife... In bed with the garbage man. But what about your son, professor? Did he find anything else out? Yes professor, what are you holding back from us? What's the scoop? My son is at this very moment, 'on his way back to this country and as soon as he has landed... We shall all find out. Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd Mable towers, mable towers, we're experiencing foul weather. Sorry! Oh, oooh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. Is this your first flight? My first drink. It's a terrible storm, do you think we're going to make it? Don't worry. These new fordent trimotors are the safest things in the sky. My name is Dale ardor, what's yours? Flesh. Flesh Gordon. Oh, professor Gordon's son? Why yes. Sir, look out! Control yourself, Dale! Control yourself, Dale! Dale! Con-control yourself, Dale! Sir, I've got a giant boner! Well slap the damn thing down. I can't! I've got to keep this thing under control. I can't! Mable towers, mable towers. You got two horny son-of-a-bitches here. We're signing off. Dale! There's no one at the controls! The plane's going down! Go down, go down! Oh yes, oh yes. Oh, flesh. Flesh! Flesh! Oh, flesh! Flesh! Let me go! Flesh! Flesh... oh! Jd Dale. We'll have to bail out. Flesh, oh my god, ooh. Oh my god! Just hold on! I can't hold anymore! Ooohhh. Oh! Jd Flesh, mmm. Dale? Dale, darling, are you all right? You called me "darling." Oh, flesh, what's happening? - Can you walk? - I think so. Here, put this on. Jd Flesh, what's that? Come on, maybe we can get to a telephone there. Stop. Not another step further. I know what you've come here for. But you're not going to get it. Look, I don't know who you think we are, but this girl's hurt, and we gotta get to a telephone. You see, we were flying along in this airplane from Tibet, when suddenly we were hit by this sex ray from outer space. And this unrestrained sex orgy ensued, which both of the pilots joined in. When I noticed the plane was going down, I took over the controls but they broke off in my hand. So you see the young lady, nearly overcome with sex madness, and myself, bailed out just before the plane crashed. And we landed just over there. Do you take me for a fool? Do you think I don't know you've come here to steal the secret plans to my new interstellar, hydrocombustion, miracle patented, micro-teflon, nuclear, gamastaddle rocketship-plane-missle! Which was twenty years in the making. And employs a new updraft design, which lifts the ship on small spirals of synthetic strontium pellets. Do you think I don't know that! Well, I've never even heard of it. So you're barking up the wrong tree. Come here, young lady. I would like to conduct a little experiment, you see there's evidence that exposure to the sex ray, increases the size of the secondary... - Jerkoff! - What? Flexi jerkoff, I thought I recognized you. Why... why you must be flesh, professor Gordon's son. I was wondering why you knew so much about the sex ray. Come, let me show you the ship. Gosh, let me introduce you. Dale ardor, this is doctor flexi jerkoff. How do you do? So you see, I've actually discovered which planet the sex ray is coming from, and fortunately, the straddle ship was ready just in time. Oh, you can't know what it was like, out here, all alone when the sex ray hit. It was hell! Fortunately, the rocket was completed before that happened, and the design was not influenced. You look so funny. Jd Oh, the likeness is incredible. I was able to get most of the parts from the sears catalogue. And you really think it will make it to the outer reaches of the solar system? It's got to. It's the last hope humanity has. Flesh... Dale... Will you come with me? It will be a dangerous trip, and I don't know what we're likely to encounter out there, but someone has got to save the earth from the treacherous clutches of that evil ray. What do you think, Dale? Flesh, let's do it. Sure, why not, we'll give it a try. Wonderful! The planet's orbit will bring it closest to the earth in approximately... Six minutes! And there's much work to be done. Come, follow me. Jd Where do you want these, doc? Right over there flesh, storage bin c. Jd What's this gizmo do, doc? Don't touch that dial! I had an assistant once who touched that dial. Touch that dial. Gee doc, you really got a lot of neat stuff. Did it take you a long time to put it all together? Don't bother me now, flesh, it's almost ready. Get the door. Which button, doc? That one. Ignition. - Ready, Dale? - Ready, flesh. All right, hang on. We're taking off. Fire rocket one. Jd Fire rocket two. Jd Jd Hang on now, we're going through the moronosphere. Jd Jd Jd Look, Dale! The moon! The earth! Oh, it's beautiful. Jd Wow! I can see the Great Lakes! There's lake Ontario, lake Michigan, lake superior... What is it, Dale? The sex ray, we're heading right for it, change course quick! It's... it's jammed, flesh, I can't move it! Let me try! Jd Another episode like that, and I'll be ready for the old folk's home. Jd Hey doc, what sort of planet does it look like to you? Definitely inhabited, flesh. No natural force could have affected us the way that sex ray did. And look at those green areas over there... It's probably forest or jungle, I should think. And those are desert areas over there. This planet even has frigid polar regions, not unlike those of earth. Let's have a closer look, shall we. Jd Hang on, we're going down. Jd Forgive me, your protuberance, but at this moment an alien ship approaches porno. Probably the earth people. Bring the ship down, but I want the earthlings brought to me unharmed. Understand? Yes, your protuberance. Jd Not too close, look! Do you suppose they're friendly? Jd The starboard gammamodulator's been hit! - I'll fix it. - Oh no! I can't control the ship, flesh! - Hold on, jerkoff! - Do something, flesh! I think we're going to crash. Oh! Oh, no, what's going to happen? Hurry, flesh! I'm hurrying, jerkoff, I'm hurrying! Save us! Oooooohhhhhh. I'm trying to! Hurry flesh! We're in deep trouble flesh. Ah, come on, jerkoff! Oh, flesh, do something! - Hurry! - Dale, quick! Give me a Bobby pin! Come here! Here's one! Oh... Save us. Jerkoff, I think I've fixed it! - Oh, god! - You're right. She's beginning to respond to the controls. All right now, hang on. Hold on Dale. The ship's falling apart! - Hold on, Dale! - I'm holding on. I'm taking her down. Jd Jd Dr. jerkoff, Dr. jerkoff! Are you all right? Oh, flesh. I think so. Is the ship badly damaged, flesh? I don't know, let's go outside and have a look. Yes. Oh, Dale. Just a moment, I think I have something here. For, uh... yes. It was my mother's. She was buried in it. Good, there's oxygen on this planet. This is the strangest place I've ever seen. I wonder why they didn't send the welcoming committee? They did, look! Quick, into that cave! Jd Sist and decease! Jd Quick, in here! Jd Hep, hep, hep. Hep, hep, hep. Left, left, left. You men search over there. Left, left, left... They'll be coming back. Let's go this way, maybe there's another way out. Jd It's so strange in here. Flesh, it almost looks alive. What is it, flesh? I'm not quite sure. Jd And what unusual formations and textures. Why, this is like no rock known to science. It's. It's not hard like a rock, it's... Whoaaaaaaaaal great galaxies! What is it doc? Some species of penisaurus, I should think. This way! Jd Jerkoff! She'd down! What... oh, oh! Better get this, jerkoff. Oh, you beast, get away from me! You stink! All right, flesh. Stand aside. Oh, no! Jd Left, left, left... Ah, ha. Oh! Flesh! What was that? The earth people. It came from down there. After them. - Run. Nol there they are. What? Take the earthlings alive. Tie them up. - I got dibs on the girl. - The blonde giant's mine. Leave the bearded one for me. Jd Jd Your sickness, we have captured the earth people, and await your command. The earth people, eh? Bring them to me at once. Fetch the earth people here! His sickness will seeeee theeemmmm! Stop shouting, you dildo. Jd Why have you come to the planet porno? To destroy the terrible sex ray that has brought chaos to our beloved planet earth. I should think you'd be thanking me. But no matter. No power in the universe can ever hope to squelch the infinite force of my sex beam. But why must you do this thing? The earth is a peaceful planet and poses no threat to you! I'll tell you later. But, how did you get here? The straddle ship I constructed. A scientist, eh? I could use a brain like yours. Guards! Take him to the laboratory and show him what to do. No, no, no! Jd Bring the earth woman closer. No! No! By the goddess yumi, you are beautiful! My eyes have never beheld such loveliness. You shall be my bride! Nol ohhhh, she is exquisite, she is exquisite. Take your filthy, vellow hands off her! Don't touch her, I'll kill you! Silence! Get him off me! Take him! Take him to the sex depletor and bring me his essence! It should add immeasurably to the pleasure of our wedding night. Stop. The blonde giant shall not be depleted. Amora. As queen of darkness, and guardian of the sacred power pasties, you have the privilege to spare him only if he survives the torture I ordain. I sentence him to trial by ordeal. So be it, then, wang. But if he survives, he's mine! To the arena with him! Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd To the depletor with him! He's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine! After them, you ninnies! Jd Sleep now, and forget. Forget all. We shall love, and my body... Will be linked forever with yours. When you awake, you shall be my king of darkness. Jd Jd Oh, Gordon... Jd Your protuberance, we have spotted queen amora's ship over the forest kingdom. Shoot them down, and bring them to me! But your assholiness, the forest people and we are sworn enemies. We could not survive a landing in this realm. Are you afraid of a few vegetables? I gave you my orders! I will be obeyed! Yes, degenerate one. Make ready for the ceremony! Porno shall have a new queen tonight. Out of my way, dildo! Guard, I need your help. Here, hold that. This, hold that too... And this also, please... And just one more thing, that's it. Very good. Put up your hands! Jd Down, please. Jd Give me the keys. Jd Jd Oh, come in me! Damn, you magnificent giant. Come, come, come! And bind us forever in darkness. Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd - W... - A - n... - G. Emperor wang is the one for me, without him, the planet porno, would be ever so forlorno. Francis newberry. Jd Jd Jerkoff! Flesh! I thought you were amora. This is all I could find to wear. How'd you get away from wang's palace? When I discovered wang's plan to destroy amora's ship, I overpowered the guard with a radium gas I developed in wang's laboratory. And, disguising myself as a pirate, followed the bomber ship and swooped down to rescue you. What about Dale? Even at this very moment, the ceremony which will render Dale and wang man and wife draws ever nearer its fateful conclusion. It's no use, flesh. Alone, we would be powerless to stop it. Flesh, look! I had led an evil life. And my thoughts have arisen from the seeds of darkness and greed. Take these stones. These are the source of my power. And with them, destroy wang and his insidious schemes. These, my power pasties, are the only force that can stop the sex beam. Once accomplished, earthlings, my spirit shall at last rest in peace. She was a noble woman, flesh. Took a lot of guts. She was a brave scout. Come on, doc, we haven't got much time to lose. Wait a minute doc, I can't go like this, I feel silly. Don't worry, flesh. I think I've got something for you in the ship. Come on, jerkoff, we've got to stop wang! - All right, flesh. - Come on! Oh please. Left, left, left, left... Jd I eft... There they are! Jd You may... Kisssss the bride. Ahhh, ha-ha... Come here, my little bottle cap. Get away from me you slimy snail! Oh! Jd That's all for this rancid affair, you Turkey! Stop! The wedding's over, wang! After them, you dildos! Jd Amateurs! The pasties, jerkoff! Jd All right, wang, where is she? What have you done with Dale? So help me if you lay a hand on her I'll... You're too late, you fool! She was spirited away barely a breath before love's first kiss. I have been robbed of my beautiful virgin bride. Shall I give it to him now, flesh? Not now doc, he's been through enough. If you find her, tell her I love her! Stop fighting me foolish woman, I'm trying to save you! Halt! I have brought the earth girl. Follow me. Jd No, no, where are you taking me! No, no, take me back to flesh. I no! Nol Jd The earth girl. We've been hoping you'd drop in, ever since we heard of your opposition to emperor wang. But, perhaps I should explain. Am chief Nellie. Commander of the vast and powerful Amazon underground of porno. An organization solely devoted to the over-throw of wang and his corrupt male chauvinist regime. But what does that have to do with me? Our spies have been watching you closely, because of your determined and flagrant dislike of wang and his cohorts... We, uh, have decided to initiate you into our ranks. But I want the earthman, flesh Gordon. You will be of more use here with us. No! No... Jd Wait, what are you doing? I've gotta get back to flesh! Jd Jd Ranks in formation, for selection inspection. Mmm, very nice face, very pretty. Nice nipple. Ohhhh, yes, mmm-mmmbh... Pretty hair, nice, shiny... What are you doing to your nipples, zerig? They look very nice. Very nice. Face is nice... Turn around, let's see. Bend over, let's see. Oh, yeah, real nice. Very nice. Nice bottom. Mmmm, no! No good. Step forward. Oh excellent, excellent, prepare yourself, you'll do. No, no! Oh! Jd Flesh! Flesh! No! Get away! Flesh! No! No! Get away! Get away! Flesh! Flesh! Flesh! Flesh! Nol jerkoff. I heard Dale... she's in some sort of trouble. Jerkoff, I hear Dale... She's in some sort of trouble. Dale! Get away! Get away! We're in some sort of pit, doc. Jd Jd Jd Jd Here let me try. Try to get us outta here. Didn't work. Stand back, flesh. Jd Come on, doc. There she is, doc. Good lord, flesh, they're dykes! Dykes! Don't any of you try anything now. I've got the power pasties and I know how to use 'em. You, get back there with the others. I know your kind. Now what were you doing down here? What were you doing with Dale? Get back there! Jerkoff! Jd Jd No, no! You might hit flesh. Jd Jd Jd Jd Jd What happened to it, flesh? An arrow. A poison tipped arrow, in fact. Whoever you are, we owe you our lives. Nonsense. I was happy to do it, for you see... I'm prince precious, rightful heir to the throne of porno. Years ago this planet was a veritable paradise, but wang, a maniacal botanist, whose organ was devoured by a crazed penis flytrap, could not tolerate the existence of so much pleasure. And so, banding together an army of the impotent and frustrated, and armed with a small, but effective, sex ray, plunged my palace into carnal chaos, and took it over, exiling me, and my few advisors, to what is now known as the forest kingdom. Then you feel that, together, we might put an end to wang's savage reign. And that our new cosmic friendship might inspire an everlasting bond of kindness and love between the peoples of this planet and yours. If there's anything I can ever do to repay you. Jd Jd Stay a while, flesh, the fun's just beginning. I'd like to, precious, but I can't. I'd better get back to the lab with doctor jerkoff and help him work on the destructo beam. Come, I'll go with you. Jd Oh, flesh, I was just going to send for you. What happened, doc? Any scientist could tell you, flesh. Now, the beam is finished and ready to be tested. Now, if my calculations are correct, one blast from my device and wang's odious sex ray will be utterly smashed to smithereens. Well, how does it work, doc? I'll show you. First, we have to attach the power pasties. Let me help you. Jd Now, over there is a scale model of wang's sex ray, surrounded by an electromagnesium force field so impervious, that were it not for the energy of queen amora's power pasties, we could never hope to destroy it. Now, stand back. Watch this. - Wow! - Fantastic, doctor. That's incredible. Congratulations. Congratulation. It works, jerkoff. It's the eighth wonder of the world. I knew it would. Then all we have to do is mount it in a ship. And blow wang's evil ray to atoms. Then we can go home, can't we, flesh? With good luck, and good weather, Dale, we'll be home tomorrow night. Oh, flesh. - Let me prepare the ship. - Yes, yes. To the ship! Jd Your aloneness, the earthmen have invented a gun, with which they plan to destroy our sex ray. Ah! I have had enough of these meddlers! They have interfered with the affairs of my regime for the very last time, and they will be stopped. Now, listen carefully. Jd Doc, we're getting close to wang's palace. Just one more minute, flesh, I'm almost ready. Careful! This device has a delicate electromagnetic balance. Any disturbance can blow us all to atoms! There it is, jerkoff, the sex ray. It's the forest flyer, sound the alarm! They've spotted us, jerkoff, get ready. Now! Stop him! He... Get him. My pasties! Jd Pull the ship up, quick! Jd - It's stuck! - Let me give it a try. Jd Flesh, we're doomed! Jd Jd We've stopped falling, what's happened? We've fallen into some sort of magnetic beam. It's drawing us safely down. But why would wang want to save us? He doesn't! Look! Jd Jd Jd When last seen, our hapless heroes were about to be crunched into oblivion by the perverted wang's chomping jaws. Is there no justice on porno? Jd Dale, this is yours. Jd Dr. jerkoff. Here's one for you, flesh. Jd Dale, are you all right? I'm all right, flesh. It's really a shame about that other guy, stealing your pasties like that, and he was my best boy. What ever happened to the other fellow? We only had four parachutes. Oh. Jd Come on, we've got to get to wang. Jd Come on, flesh, let's go! Hurry up! Jd Jd There he goes, after him. Jd Jd Your struggles are useless! You are trapped and you shall not live! I have tolerated your feeble attempts to thwart me for the very last time! We have ways of dealing with you, yankee. See how you like my royal flush, earthling! - What is it? - The floor! Oh, no. Jd - There used to be one. - That's it, earthlings. Goodbye, Gordon. Sweet dreams. Oh. Here it comes. Jd Bye, bye! - Nice knowing you, flesh. - Yes, it was, thank you. Jd J flesh Gordon is dead hey j j flesh Gordon is dead hey j j flesh is dead j j Gordon is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j j baby flesh Gordon is dead j jd J flesh Gordon is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j j flesh is dead j j flesh is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j j dead dead dead dead j jd J flesh Gordon is dead j j flesh Gordon is dead j your lowness. Oh-oh, great impotentate, I have done as you commanded, and I brought you the power jewels. Though the earthmen cannot now destroy the sex beam, they're alive and loose in the palace... Never mind that, I have dealt with them already! Give me the Jewel. Did the nasty spy frighten my babies? Never mind that, little wangy-pangy is going to take care of you all. Wangy favors you with a trinket, my little peanut-butter cup. Hmm. Mmm. What do you mean it's stuck? - It's stuck! - Stuck? What do you mean, stuck? Stop! . Flesh Gordon! The Jewel, wang! The Jewel, where is it? Gimme that Jewel, or so help me I'll finish you right here and now! Let me have him, flesh. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. The Jewel, wang, where is it? You guess! Jd - Am I gettin' warm? - Oh, very warm. - Is it this, flesh? - No, that's not it. Jd Give me that Jewel. Give me that Jewel this minute, do ya hear? Ah, I can't, it's stuck. What do you mean, it's stuck? Gimme that Jewel! I can't! Idiot, you thought you could defy me, but you have yet to tangle with my rapist robots. Jd It's stuck! Jd Oh, I wish I had a picture of this. Give me that Jewel this minute, do ya hear? Flesh! Jd What-a-way to go, eh, earthman? In a flash of mechanical ecstasy. Flesh! Flesh! Flesh! Flesh! Flesh! No! Nol jd Fools! Idiots! What do you think you're doing? What-a-way to go, hey, wang? You have not heard the last of wang. Jd Flesh, come on, we can't let wang get away. Never mind wang now, we have to get the Jewel and save the earth. That reminds me... Oh, I can't, I can't! Spit it out! It's stuck! Jd A plague, a pox, a pestilence of storm! Anything, anything, oh, great one! The fate of all evil rests in your hands! Arise, arise, and destroy your enemies, and avenge the glorious cause of perversion! Jd Ooh, boy. I just love murder. Out of my way, you little fart. Jd A monster's work is never done. Oh. Oh, yeah. Mmm-mmm_ Jd Oh, fuck. Stop, look... Listen. Too late now, my imbecilic siblings! The sex ray is too good for your earth! I'm going to burn your fucking planet to a fucking crisp! Jd Watch your back! Well... Mmm. How delightful. He's got Dale! Quick jerkoff, use the destructo beam to kill him! I dare not, at this distance there's too great a risk of hitting Dale. If only we could get closer. Wait a minute, we'll use wang's rocket ship. Come on. Jd Ah, you and I are going to be good friends. Coochie. Jd And... Wow. Well, this is the tower of murder, and it's where I hang out. Oh, oh, no. Are you having a good time? Jd Come on, jerkoff. Ooh, flesh! Flesh, save me. God, it's high. Jd Hmm. Yes, you're incredible. I wonder how you'd look in black... Nylons. What do you think of that, hmm? Hmm? Huh? Oh... Hmm-hmm. Hmm-hmm. Jd I just want to look at your tits. There she is, doc. Jd Hey, they're getting serious. Okay, doc, get ready. Ready, flesh. Fire! Doc, you missed! I know I missed. I'll get him. Well, I never. Jd Up yours, Gordon. Oh, wow, uhf, pain. And now, you get... Yours. Get away. My ass. My ass. Pain, humiliation. Hemorrhoids. Jd - Dale, are you all right? - Oh, flesh. Gordon. Let's do it fast, flesh! For this you'll pay. No one burns my ass and lives to get laid. Oh, shit! Jd Jd - Goodbye, jerkoff. - Goodbye, prince. And Dale. - Goodbye flesh. - Precious. We'll miss you around here. Don't worry, precious, I'll be back, and next time it'll be a friendly visit. With wang out of the way and his terrible regime dispersed, the universe is once again safe for democracy and freedom, and the right of all due happiness, each according to his own personal religious convictions. Jd Goodbye, flesh. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Have a safe journey. - It's been grand. - Yes. We'll see you. Goodbye. Goodbye, precious. Be sure and write us. Take care precious. - Okay, see ya. - Be good. - Bye now. - So long. Adios. Jd Jd There she is, the earth. Jd Oh, flesh, there's no place like home. Jd
