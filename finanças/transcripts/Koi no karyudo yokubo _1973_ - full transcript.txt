A NIKKATSU PRESENTATION Please listen to us! About the current situation of the nation... How many times did you end up in the police station? Three times. - How was it? - Well, you know. It was a complete waste of time. They questioned me for an entire day and I realized that our values are completely different. I got the feeling that they live a lonely life. It's loud here. So, they keep on asking how I was feeling when I masturbated on stage, like if it felt good for me. That’s ridiculous! The entire group got questioned one at a time. And after that, they keep on using words such as obscene, abuse, grotesque and filthy. So, then I started thinking about what obscenity is, and came to the conclusion that it’s a word made up by the authority. I see. Authority, huh? What is it, exactly? Who did you hear it from? It’s the other side. Makes sense. I don’t think it’s that easy to identify authorities and enemies. With this experience... You know, I went to the authority's lair. It was like a beast's lair. When I went there, I thought, “This is what authority is.” It was like I could see it. Interesting. The more I think about it, the more I feel it’s an insult. Is there such a thing as obscenity in this world, in the first place? But they claim it’s obscenity... And so I told the cops when they were questioning me: “If you call that obscene," "then what we’re doing here is far more obscene.” And they agreed. So, I think they’re more obscene than anyone else. Cigarette? In any case, when you choose to live your life on your own terms, you always bump into a wall. Like social status and common beliefs. And police. And? And if that happens to be a crime, I’ll happily join the group. I was twenty years old. LOVE HUNTER: LUST And I will never let anyone say that that is the most beautiful age in life.

Directed by: Seiichiro Yamaguchi At age 20, I… Mr. Toda, Mr. Hanai is waiting for you downstairs. Yo! Yo! How did it go with her? Is she going to collaborate? Yeah, she’s got spunk. I’ll make it work. I see. Your deadline is the end of the month. You have plenty of time, so do as you please. Instead of focusing on her group, I intend to focus on her. I’ll leave that to you. Don’t get too involved, though. Your next job is already waiting for you. What is it? How do you feel about going to India? - India? - Yeah. Takeshi Aoyama is there. Takeshi Aoyama, huh? You remember too, don’t you? There were rumors about him. Yes, right now he’s with a hippie group over there. It’d be more worthwhile than writing about some girl. It would be perfect for you. Well, think about it. How about we go out to eat, Misa? Sure, give me a minute. I’ll be waiting up front. - Can I go out for a bit, mama? - Alright. - I’ll be back soon. - Have a good time. Why did Mr. Aoyama go to India? He’s a romanticist. He prefers flowers over fruit. And you? A realist? That’s why I've been living this pathetic life every day. Well, shall we close up? What's wrong? Are you alright? I’m alright, I just slipped. - And there’s nothing there. - Never mind, go to bed. I can’t see with my left eye anymore. I’m a burden, aren’t I? Too late for that... I'm scared though. Let’s go to the hospital once more. - I told you, basically... - This is not working... - But... - If you don’t say it… Your head looks best on me. A realistic rape scene... During filming, we have to use radical rape scenes to break away the bourgeois stereotype. Maybe. So, considering what we have done so far for this film, but I believe we are going in the right direction... Hey, take a look at that. The result? It’s not about the results. It’s fun and all but, realistically, we were planning to raise funds. Right now, I’m going after the United Red Army, so I’m researching and reading up on people like Fumiko Kaneko and Sugako Kanno*. *Two anarcho-feminists that were also tied to terrorism in the early XX century. I believe men fear the power that woman emit when they commit to something. The Way of Modern Love I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I was in the sauna. I see. You wrote this article in the magazine. Most of it is made up. Are you going to make things up about me too? - In the beginning, that was my plan. - And now? What’s the matter? The first man I had sex with isn’t too happy. The second one too. All the men I sleep with end up being unhappy. How about the third? The same. And the fourth? - The same. - How about the fifth? Whatever. Now is now and the past is the past. It’s not relevant anymore. By the way, do you remember one of your members got arrested in Nagata-cho in the past? You joined them after that. I wrote an article about it. That place is the center of political action. You don’t seem to fit the description. Why did you join the group? Why? How do I say it? You know that idiotic group mentality they have? I fancy that a lot. - Idiotic group mentality, huh? - Yeah. Like you can start something. But do you think you can really make a difference? Isn’t it you, yourselves, that don’t believe it can be done? But, you see... All we can do is move forward. We have nothing to lose. But at that level, you’re no different than us in the past. If what you’ve been telling me is the truth, then we’re connected in ways you’re not aware of. For the youths of today, as they fight to make a beautiful society, a man falls in love with a woman... - Stop! - Turn that off. We used to talk like that when we were young. Are you still using those lines? Don’t interfere with my work. - How old is she? - Um... about 18. - She’s the same as you. - Really? But a woman like that is dangerous to a man. Go back to your room! The way you work is different than usual. - No, it isn’t. - It is different. Isn’t that what you really feel? You can get serious about anything when you’re twenty. Once you scar them, it’ll take a long time to heal. How was the hospital? When the second half of the trial started, I learned just how frightening our legal system is. I was completely oblivious to it. Talk about ignorance, I blindly believed that our legal system in this constitutional state was fair and just. Fact hearing at a trial is based on prior research, but the lack of accuracy was astounding. “It’s your fault for going against the police when you’re a woman.” “I didn’t go against anything. I was just standing silently and was pushed.” “That’s not possible.” “It’s not possible? But he did! You weren’t there to see it!” “I’m the one that was pushed!” “You’re a cantankerous woman.” “I’m just saying what happened!" It’s just that you showed your vagina. Were you really doing it on stage? No, I wasn't. Then, how are you able to make that face, like you feel so good? You felt good, right? Answer: “Silence” Question: “You felt good, right?” Answer: “Silence” How about it? Did you feel good? It’s okay, you can get on top. Alright, like that. Hey, the light. It’s too dark. Come on, move it. - Chiiko, more. Do it, Chiiko. - I can’t get it up, it’s no use. Cut, cut! What the hell are you doing? If you don’t get it in quickly, you’re wasting film. - Once more, one more time. - Alright, let’s go. We're starting. Go. Try moving more. Like that, yeah. - Move the light that way. - Okay, understood. I can’t do it, it’s useless. That’s because your revolutionary spirit is lacking! But how is making porn revolutionary? - Come on! - What are you doing? What are you saying? - What do you want? - Do it right! Our goal for the society is to create a world where we’re respected and have a complete set of manuals for the bourgeoisie. More specifically, by producing and screening porn films, we revolutionize the general public’s thoughts on sex to survive this terrible situation. We are the good people who are helping the society. That’s right! It’s our responsibility! Don’t you get it? - Whatever, I can’t do it. - What are you talking about? Changing your attitude will solve nothing. I’m not changing my attitude. Ah, shut up. I’ll do it myself. Good, good! You won’t be welcomed back, Masahiro. Let's get with it. - Let’s do it. - Okay, let’s go. He’s got his own stuff to do. Porn won’t be enough to assemble people. Yeah... Anybody can get porn anywhere these days. They won’t pay money to come see it. Why don’t we do a special show? A special show? Why should I do such a thing? Because you have the best body, of course. What do you want, you? No, no! No! No! Stop! Let me go! Stop it at once! I wasn’t strong enough to make them stop. Hi there, it’s been awhile. I was going to leave if you didn’t show up soon. I’m sorry, I'm sorry. There was traffic. Why don’t you come in? It's fine, I'll sit here. I’m sorry to make you come all the way out here. I asked him to because I wanted to meet you once. Have you heard anything about me from Toda? No, I heard nothing. I see. You’re twenty, I hear. I’m almost twenty-one. You’re so young. I was your age when I met Toda. We were both students. That’s why I wanted to meet you. You were in elementary school at that time. I'm sure you can’t see it now, but she used to be a political activist. She gave everything she had to the cause. In the midst of it all, she fell in love and fought. Before we knew it, we had been defeated and were completely lost. We suffered emotional scars but, in her case, it left a physical scar as well. So, are you happy now? No, I'm not. Why is that? Because I had a wonderful youth with Toda that I’ve been dragging for decades. Of course, I did all I can so I have no regrets. But now, the passion is gone, and yet I can’t escape it. I don’t understand the past you all keep mentioning. You talk about this and that experience, but I can only respond by saying, “That must have been difficult.” Unfortunately, I’m not a romantic and don’t have dreams and hopes. That may be so. But, then, what are you living for? To live and to love, do we need a meaning? I think human beings can live without a meaning. That’s what people say when they’re young. As long as there’s a river you can jump into to get to the other side, all is good, right? And, then, you can start over. I lost, I won, I lost, I won, I lost, I won, I lost, I won, I lost, I won, I lost, I won. Men and women live in the past. They lived in the past. What is the past? You need to be careful with your overconfidence and investing too much in other people. The planet is protecting you. Early marriage will be unhappy. You need to wait. Hey, can you please do as I say today? What’s the matter? You’re in a good mood. Well, that fortune teller said the complete opposite from last year. It made me happy. Well, then. What should we do? What should we do? What’s the matter? You’re silent all of a sudden. I just remembered something unpleasant. It was a year ago. The guy was quick. I was in bed within an hour of meeting him. When I opened the curtains, there were no windows and my shocked reflection was looking back at me. - Which floor? - 6th floor. I rent it for work. My partner is away now. What's wrong? I don't feel too well. Why? If you’re going to go home, now is the time. Do you have a cigarette? Yeah. - What will you drink? - Can I get brandy? Hey, why don't we dance? I don't like to. Why is that? Because... I don’t know how to dance. I had no opportunities. Because your wife has bad eyesight. That has nothing to do with you. - When was your first time? - Huh? With a man. When I was 19. He was a real playboy. And then? Is this another interview? Hey, tell me about yours. Let's see. I was 20 when it happened. With my wife. Real love doesn’t happen often between people. My wife and I... It was the first time for the both of us. How does it look? No way! - Shall we dance? - No... Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance! - Shall we? - Yup! Wait... How was Mr. Toda back then? He hasn’t changed much. He maybe gained a little weight. I wasn’t too shabby either back then. No way, I can’t imagine it. You’ve gained so much weight now. Back then, we fell in love with the same woman, but Toda won. Wait, so that means you were in love with mama?! It’s the first time I’ve heard it. She was our idol back then. It was the first time I went to visit the art school in Mitaka. Let’s not talk about old times. Toda, you and I, we all died, along with the times, and along with history. Whatever we did would have made very little difference. - Mr. Toda isn’t back yet? - No. How do you know him? What did you want? I want to settle something with him regarding his recent interview. - Settle? - That’s right. It’s about his political standpoint. Well, you might have something to do with it as well. Why don’t you commute to work from my mansion? That wouldn’t look good. Mama wouldn’t like it and it’s not safe these days. - Stop it. - What’s wrong? - I don’t like anyone touching it. - Why? Just because. I’m too cheap. Well, come here. You still like mama, don’t you? Yes, I do. But it’s in the past. - But those two are unbelievable. - What about? You’re so mean. I know you know. - Huh? - I watch them do it sometimes. Oh, then show me exactly how they do it. - No. - Come on. I don't want to. Say. Why were you so rough? Hey! I wanted to completely ruin you. Because you’re so healthy. Healthy? Because I’m sick. Sick, you say? A malignant illness from not being able to let go of my experience from 10 years ago. I don't believe it. Is the past that important? It can't be helped. It can't be avoided. 10 years, huh? That's so uncool. Uncool, huh? The nerve in her eye... It was damaged when a fellow member threw a rock and hit her. The rock I throw may hit another one on our side, but I keep on throwing the rocks. It really is uncool, huh? Are you disturbed by it? But the fact that you can’t let go of your past means that you’re true to yourself. That’s how pathetic I am, but that’s my life. There's not much I can do. You should go home now. The door will lock on its own, so you can just go. Say, isn’t there a way to cure your illness? But it's strange. What is? Being like this makes me feel safe. I don’t want to go home. Say, I don’t have to go, do I? Right? All the people came for the special show. If Shinko doesn’t come, it’s useless. It’s not like I can take her place. - Who do you think you’re kidding, idiot? - Ouch, that hurts. You contacted Shinko, right? Yeah, I did what I could. Whether she comes or not, is up to her. It can’t be helped. How about I do it? Idiot, who wants to look at a professional porn star? - Come! - She arrived! - Oh yes! - You’re finally here! Messed up hair And completely naked It’s alright, you can come closer. It's the last time I'm doing this. But, in exchange, you need to listen to me. You know, I... It’s been a year since I joined this group. Since I joined, I’ve done fuck scenes on stage, and I did a lot of things like this. But the things I’ve lost were greater. I didn’t study. I was too easy on myself. But that's because... the guys brought one job after another. In such a hopeless situation, trying hard and giving my all made me stimulated and addicted, and let me stay comfortably wherever I was. Do you understand? Do you understand? As I worked naked, I hid the fact that I knew little. I may have been naked all those times, but I imagined clothes to protect myself. Except now, I’m completely naked. I’m naked for the first time. And I can feel the anger. Why couldn’t I take off my clothes? If the rest of you aren’t naked, why do I have to be naked? Why is that? Why? Why? You’ve changed. I heard you left home. Are you planning not to come back to us anymore? Our relationship was more than that. Hey. Hey, Shinko, I... Stop it! You believed in The Rose Colored Group, right? Right, Shinko? - Stop! - Shinko... Rose Colored Group, huh? When are you going to grow up? It’s his fault, isn’t it? I heard you two live together. It’s none of your business! But thankfully, I’ve realized that I don’t need to be here anymore. Are you going to betray us? Betray? You worthless man. You always keep yourself in a safe spot. You have no right to tell me anything. What are you talking about? Hey, that Toda guy hasn’t done any job properly so far. I will never accept that guy’s pathetic behavior. You stopped trying, right? Hey, Shinko! Hey! You got dumped, huh? You fool! It’s not that kind of a problem. Then, what kind of a problem is it? Shut up! It's enough! Stop... How does it feel inside? I'm falling in love... For the first time... You're a sad person. I can accept that you’ve changed and the fact that you want to be with her. What I can't accept is the phrase you’ve chosen, “that you want to start over.” I'm not jealous. I just can’t forgive this pathetic notion that you will be able to start over. You've been acting like you’re different in the ten plus years you’ve been with me, and yet you’ve only lived your life protecting your past wounds. If all you can do is protect your past, you’re actually not living. It may be a pathetic illusion, but... Let's end this. If we keep talking, I will end up saying something I will regret later. It will bring back everything in the past. No Visitors Shinko, open the door! Shinko! Sometimes, I howl, Towards death I get confused on my own The fact that I can't eat a green apple And the fact that I can't rely on Genet's diary See, can you see? The enticing evil hands Are everywhere, Can you see them? But you can't flinch... Shinko! It’s okay, right? We’re okay like this... Was I crying? Was I talking in my sleep? I was dreaming. It was a very strange dream. It was snowing, but there was lightning too. Funny, isn't it? You told me that, in parts of India, you can see the lightning hit the ground. That's probably why. Hey! Here you go. Let's stop already. We can’t stop until the matter is settled. It'll be morning, let's stop. Hey, hey, hey! Let's stop. What are you doing?! Let me go! No... no! At the end of this report, let me add this. The idea of restarting life is nothing but a pathetic illusion. The first life is a tragedy and the second one is a farce, but we all look forward to what the third can be, so we keep living the second life. We settled the matter on our end. With the woman who’s awkwardly enjoying it. There is a slight look of distaste in her eyes, but you can hear her, can't you? You must have expected it, right? Failed Youth. Defeated Revolution. If I don’t hurry, I’ll miss the class. Roses in June, Blood Drips, I was young The armored car burned, the panels burned, it was a festival. It’s dark. It’s dark. It’s dark. It’s dark. The snow that falls on the heart, snow that accumulates. 70’s, 80’s. THE END
