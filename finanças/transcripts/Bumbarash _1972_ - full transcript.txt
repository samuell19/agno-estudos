There is a meeting there! - What? - Nothing. Stay put! There is a meeting there! Comrade commander, they ordered me not to let strangers in. Since when a criminal is a stranger? Guard him. I'm going to report of him. At the corner! Death to the Whites! I can't prove the greatcoat not to be mine. A bullet will prove it. I'm friendly, don't you see it? On the contrary, I have suffered from gangsters. They will handle it. - It will be hard to prove my innocence. - Yes. What do you read? Capital: Critique of Political Economy. Capital: Critique of Political Economy by Karl Marx. I skip images and tables, but I key into a proletarian thing. Understand? - And what's the key? - Look, holy shit! I was in a white dress, Everybody were dancing waltz. I and a young adjunct Were standing At the window with The shutters closed. He was sufficiently Shy and brave. And then I by myself, I by myself put out An already bored chandelier. And then I by myself, I by myself put out An already bored chandelier. How pleasant The intimate encounters are! How pleasant The kind talk is! But put out, put out, Please put out the candles, If you want to fix the fire! But put out, put out, Please put out the candles, If you want to fix the fire! It's him! Bruise! He is going to escape! To the left, to the left! He is going to escape! He escaped! Open up! One second, boys, one second! Come here! - What did you bring, young lady? - My dowry. As soon as the war come to an end, I will marry some governor. Don't worry, dear, I won't harm you. If only we spent your dowry on drink. Where did you get this drapery? From the train? What's your interest? None of your business! I live a little out-of-the-world place, so I don't know who is at the helm of state. Whatever the regime is I want to drink to my heart's content. Bring the birdie here. The health is yours, the throat is ours. Up! You are welcome! You can start. He knocked at the door, he asked to sleep overnight. So I let him in. Cause I'm a fighter against domination and tyranny. Get out of a place. That's him! As I can see he is hungry. He said: "Give me a slice of bread, please". "Boy, I can give you more. There are small sausage, pork fat and sour cream in my basement. Come on, go there, I'm too old for this stuff. I have a dicky heart and bad back". He goes there, but I locked him up. He started to curse me, knock and bang on the door. By the morning he calmed down. So we meet again, Cock-a-doodle-doo. You know what, you killed Shurka with your fucking bomb! Gavriil! Don't ruin our dinner! I don't drink with gangsters. Oh, I'm not a gangster! I am an etoile, my sweetheart. The etoile from Saint-Petersburg. You know what does it mean? There is no need for me to use these bourgeois words. I think aristocrats loved your grandmothers. I can say it looking at you. Sweetheart, and aristocrats loved me. Banker Rukavishnikov sent a carriage for me, when I was on tour in Moscow. I was so young! He told me: "Sofochka, don't you want to to go to the right? There is the Bolshoi Theatre". "No, I want to go to the left. There is the Maly Theatre". Yashka also likes to tell fairytales, but about bright future. - Tell us. - You, you... Do you know, who I am? She is a granddaughter of Stepan Razin! What, what? You are a piece of shit! Rascal! Bury him. Bury him alive. Bury him. Gavrila and Hamster. Come on, right now! Now! Peace of shit! Rascal! I am so adorable and Incomparable. And as you know, I feel so comfortable. Je vous aime, I want it to be like that. Let's blow together on The candle. Love is like a blizzard, And we are wandering. And we don't spend nights Without each other, Je vous aime, I want it to be like that. Let's blow together on The candle. Love is a mystery, And there is no solution. At first it's sweet, But then it's only torment. Je vous aime, I want it to be like that. Let's blow together on The candle. Love is a poison, Fate is a turkey, Life is a monkey. Je vous aime, I want it to be like that. Let's blow together on The candle. I am so adorable and Incomparable. And as you know, I feel so comfortable. Je vous aime, I want it to be like that. Let's blow together on The candle. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those Who trespass against us, And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Heh, Yashka, Yashka! Palaces and fountains. A fairylike life... I didn't go with you. I'm tired. I spent two years in the trenches. I wanted to live without fighting. And this is how it all happened. Run away from everyone, hide from everyone. And what could I do out of the bushes? It was like a concussion. I was scared, Yashka. I know it, I was scared. Sorry me, Yasha. Don't think, don't be scared, rest in peace. They will pay for it, Yasha! I'm telling you, I promise. I will kill them as many times as I'll meet them. I will kill them as many times as I'll meet them. They will pay for it, Yasha! I'm telling you, I promise.

Let's go fight for such a life when... I don't drink with bandits. Ah, Yashka, Yashka! Leave me a little. Don't move! What are you laughing at? The moon can be seen through your grenade. Yes, indeed, it's empty. My name is Lev Demchenko. I can't survive here alone. Mother used to pray for me and beseech the Savior, Used to kiss the cross and bow without rest, And her dear sonny is fated a long travel, Companies in diamonds and an interest in spades. A crane is flying in the skies, a sailor is to sail the seas, And who and whereto pulls me on about the wide world, And whereabouts a prize for me, And whereabouts a trap for me - Go wander, soldier, and look for an answer. A crane is flying in the skies... Ah, where do I shelter? Let me look about: There’s a picket right ahead, and a trap behind. Yonder are the white, the green and the golden shoulder-strapped, And everyone has got one think tank, so do I.

Only in the skies I have never ever dinnered – Savior, pray, forgive me, for I’m gonna hang about.

Because of this greatcoat? Not all Reds are redhead. I'll sit in the cellar, he'll hang a bag. At this time, the gang will come. And you will appear with the Reds. Then I'll sit in the cellar and take them with my bare hands. - I can't go to the Reds. - Then let's make it together. - I'll go and sit in the cellar. - No, I will! More step! More step! It seems this is Reds, and their commander is ahead. One cannon. Something is cooking in the field kitchen, smells like borsch. Maybe join them? Are there any redheads among them? Brunette, two blondes. Another brunette. Smells like borsch. Let's do it as agreed. And if you meet that Redhead? Then we'll avenge Yashka. And then we'll see what happens. - Well, hold on for an hour. - I will. - Okay. - Okay. - Let's do it. - Take it. You see how it all happens. Now is troubled time. How will it all end? No one knows yet. You don't know, I don't know, no one knows. Well, okay, let it be as it should be. And if something doesn't happen, Moor, then it doesn't. What are you looking at? You look at me, but you don't understand a thing. Oh, you, Moor! Hello, old man! - What are you yelling about? - I want to eat. - Hello, son! - Hello, old man! Well, sit down, sit down. Eat this honey with some bread. What are you waiting for? Eat! What are you waiting for? Thank you. Thank you, old man. You help a fighter against the world counter-revolution. No problem! You're always welcome. Oh, you Red Guard! Maybe you want some moonshine? A moonshine? No. What about homemade sausage, lard, sour cream? Then take it yourself in the cellar. - In the cellar? - Yeah. I would do it myself but, you know, old age, my back and heart... I'll do it myself. Okay, go then. Not there. The cellar is there. It's here? No, go there. There are a lard and homemade sausage. And cocoa? - What? - I said, cocoa too? Red Guard! Hey, soldier! Why are you silent? What are you doing over there? I eat your sausage with sour cream. How is it? I locked you up. - Haven't you heard? - I have. So why are you silent? Scream, swear! I don't want to. How's that? Scream, swear! I've locked you up. No, I won't. What does it mean? Why you won't? - Scream and swear! - Okay. I will swear. Oh, you bastard! - Oh, you reptile! - That's better. You dirty "Counter"! You are a rascal! Old rascal! Why did you lock me up? I'll smash all your cellar! I'll tear your hair out! Bastard! - You, "Counter"... - That's better. You're a bloodsucker! Hello, old man. - Where is he? - There. Where else he could be? - What are you doing? Open it! - Hell no! Open it, or it'll be worse for you! Destroy them all! Give up! Take that, you bastards! Bumbarash, get out! One second! I survived! Not him. And where's that guy? No, not him. They left with their tails, but you came with the stars. - Here he is, a hero! - Here he is, dearie! This is your guy? I heard that there were bandits nearby, and I hid him. You can rest, now I'll give you a salty cabbage and a moonshine. And where is the girl who made dances in here? Sophia. I don't know any Sophia. All who have been, are all here. You see, even the boss doesn't know. Don't deceive us, we know that you have a shelter here for bandits. Jesus! What a shelter? Right here. Die, you hicks! Die of hunger! Of lice! Leave it, old man. He passed away. Of greed. In the bandit shelter, which we destroyed, we found a wearable footwear. Although it's not uniform, but in good condition. And almost not worn. But, comrades... it's only 29 pairs. And 80% of us are almost barefoot. Therefore, I'll choose those who have a particularly bad situation. And then let them choose between themselves. So why select? I have nothing at all! It will be like I said! - Where are your soles? - They fell off while I was walking. Step forward. Stop. Step forward. Stop. - Why did you miss me? - Yours are good enough. The revolution is being made for final justice. Brothers, what does this mean? Me and Bumbarash found a bandit shelter, we risked our lives and received nothing for it? God knows I'm not going to do it again! You will. You will when I order you. Step forward. The cell decided that Party members should not claim this. I'm in shock. All members of the party are so conscious? Yes. Come on, lady, lift your leg. Let's see if these expensive shoes will suit you. What's the matter? Don't be afraid, Aunt Galya, we won't hurt you. We are Reds! Take it all! Will you stay? I have to pay for Yashka with Sonya and Gavrila. Why so sad? You'll go to the front, and the bandits will come here. - You'll go to the front? - Yes. Do you want to become our nurse? Agree? - We'll take her as a nurse. - I agree. What are you doing? She has a mother, sisters. Gavrila will kill everyone. - Do you agree? - I do. Shivers, you, bourgeois, The last battle has come, The entire poor class Rose up against you. He smiled, laughed, And broke all the chains, And he fights for freedom, As a hero. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Saber, bullet, bayonets - He's not afraid of anything. You, darling, Wait for me, And I will come. I will come And I'll hold you, If I won't die In battle. In that hard hour For the working class For the whole country. We will win, and the whole globe Will become ours.

He won't go, I know him. - What are you talking about? - Bumbarash! - Look what the Whites have. - Got it! I will. We are surrounded on all sides, there is only a swamp here. - You'll take the document with you. - What document? Extraordinarily important one. - I won't go! - You will!

And I know the answer. If you want to ask, I'll tell you. - Go. - "Borisoglebsk". Correct. - Where are your shoulder straps? - What shoulder straps? So, in fact, the Commander-in-Chief sent me to the rear to the Reds. With a particularly important task. Now I'm going back. Give me a cigarette. Yes, that's better. Well, I gotta go. - And where are you going? - I'm going to the headquarters. - So do I. - Why for? To give an important report. - Show me. - It's in me. I'm a very practical person. If the Reds catch me, I won't have to eat a report. I remember everything. You're all lying. Tell me something unusual! Even with foreign words! Okay. Ein, zwein, drecht... cocoa. Amitu guri tsufari pari driker biker locomotive. I can do that - Ein, zwein, drecht, cocoa. Amitu guri tsufari pari driker biker locomotive. His Excellency Colonel Korn calls me a foreign word - a phenomenon. In the mornings he gives me a glass of vodka. And he says: "You, Strigunov, have a gift from God." Say something else. Aratara pan kana holo zolo volo pelo tselo locomotive! Aratara pan kana holo zolo volo pelo tselo locomotive! - Where is your headquarters? - On the Semenov farms. And yours?
