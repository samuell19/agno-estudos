Were you aware that 100,000 people die each year from irritable bowel syndrome? That's more than the amount of people that die from suicide and pneumonia combined. There's no way that's true. I didn't think IBS killed. Oh, it's true. And where did you get this information? Are you ready to order? Yes, I'm starving. What's your personality type? I can't remember. Mine's ESTJLRT. And the extra letters are? Because I have an extra big personality. Oh my gosh, dating you is like dating one of those gym machines. Leg press? - No, the... - Lap pull? - No, it's like the... - Stationary row. Sure, I don't care. Does this shirt make me look fat? What? You're getting off topic. I'm breaking up with you. But I'm in the most best clubs and schools and stuff. My Uber's here. Wait, are you for real? I don't think she's coming back. Oh! Well, Swan, here we are again at the International Beats with Mouth Competition. It's sure to be a good year. What do you think? I think you sure look beautiful tonight. And so does my husband. We have the Melodogs tearing up the stage this year. Oh, you're so right it's wrong, Stale. Look at them go! Found it! Cloney, look at you. You're pathetic. Your hair is an absolute mess, you have lipstick in your teeth, and is, is that a homeless guy tailing you? I don't understand why you can't do what I tell you to do the way that I tell you to do it. God, the Musicats are doomed with you nitwits. Screw up your solo, and I will get my revenge. Don't worry, if I screw it up, I'll get revenge on myself. You better. Melodogs, stay! Musicats, you've gotta be kitten me right now. Why don't you take a meow-ment to appreciate our purr-fect performance. But for real, try not to mark your territory. Ooh. Paws in, ladies. One, two, three. I can't believe the Musicats made it to the finals this year, who knew? Who knew? This is the first all-feline group to make it to the IBWMC, Swan. You are right, Stale. And this will be interesting, because the Musicats, they can't typically meow their way to victory. They're going to have do some real meow-capella. People do think they sing well, but I'm sure it's their finely-tuned bodies. In fact, that's exactly what it is. Have you seen the movie "Click", Swan? I wish I had one of those remotes so I could fast forward through this performance right now. Or we could pause time for us. Look at that fog, it is so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. This is a turn of events. It's like driving over a misty lake early in the morning. Oh, oh, it's in my mouth. Hi there, welcome to Morton Triversity! What dorm? Uh, Bigtall, I think.

Yeah, I know, I read the script, but who is gonna solo? Why not Wrecka solo? Ooh, totes mcgotes. No, look at her. She's a wreck, her name is literally Wrecka. Wrecka should solo. Wrecka would murder that solo. She took the knee shot. - Yeah, you did! - You really should. Okay, I'll do it. As long as we do one of my arrangements. Um, no. Um, why not? Um, shut up.

In fact, everyone down front has a mask on in preparation for the worst. So far we're good, but this song is far from over. Come on, yes! Yes! Prepare for another disaster. Laundry sounds pretty good. Say that again, I will chop your ears off. They always come out with a bang. They always do, Swan. You might want to take some notes from them if you want my heart. Ooh. I don't know, I just really hope she's okay, you know, guys? Wrecka! I totally saw them drag you off after the show! Yeah, how was prison? It was fine. What are you guys doing here? We had to come support you, duh. I'm trying to nap, and they won't leave. I would just like to say that we almost got cut up there. They really wanted the Ghostapellas to win, especially after that supernatural stunt. Well, maybe we should do a different arrangement then. No, we'll do the same arrangement we've always done, because I'm the big girl here and everyone does what I say. What do you think, Greg? Do a different arrangement! See? No, and that's final! Do you see all these speakers? They would disagree with you. No, we're not doing that! Yes we are. Pillow fight! You're playing my song, you're playing my song! You're finally playing it.

It's nasty! I might save some for later, but let's just go. Let's just go. Um, let me get that for you. What, what is it? Geez, it's really in there. Sally, what's wrong? Uh, looks like we're out of gas. I thought you filled up. Well, that was before I got slammed with salad. Oh, WTF, you guys! How are we gonna get there now? Somebody wake up Laundry. Well, we could call. Musicats, how is it that we all ended up crammed together in this van? Oh! You okay? I thought cats always landed on their feet. Oh, I know how we all ended up crammed together in this van! The kindness of my own heart, mm. I would take your heart, put it in a sandwich, and eat it, if I could. Oh, you are a gem, like always.

No, but this leprechaun won't leave me alone. - Well, I texted Wrecka. - What? I think you overreacted and owe her an apology. I'm not acapologizing. She's not the leader here. Yeah, well, you're not always right. So what do we do now? We do it my way. Besse, I know you're in there. I can smell the popcorn from here. Besse, come on. Come talk to me. Um.

Look, I got my appetite back, okay? And this one must be a mute. I'm not really sure why she hasn't talked the whole movie. I asked the writers the same thing. They didn't have an answer. I'm texting Wrecka too. You should do it, Dennis. No, I don't want her here! Whoa. Why do we have to conform to all these old versions of our group? Yeah, let's just be us. Ditto. You guys think I'm a jerk. I'm the jerk, I'm the freak obsessed with winning. Laundry, you are too controlling, and it's ruining us. I can be cool if I want to. I can let go. What is she doing? I think she's gonna fart. Oh, here it comes. You're unbalanced. You know it's not my fault, okay? Guys! Stop! What are you guys doing? Nothing, this is a Musicats rehearsal. I know. Look. I just came to say I'm sorry. I was a bit of an acabutt, and I wanna be a part of this. Wait. Oh my gosh. That was awkward. My dad was really rough with me as a child. He used to beat me, you know. But just in "Mario Kart." But he would spank me too. In "Mario Party." Sometimes I would get burned if I didn't do right. Because I forgot to put on sunscreen. What I'm trying to say is, I know I've been mean. I get it. I shouldn't have been that way. And Cloney's been blowing down my back about it the whole time. I don't know if you realize. Sometimes I just cry uncontrollably. Um. Hadn't noticed just yet. But this is good. Someone else wanna share? Uh, I guess I'll go first. I'm a virgin. There, I said it. Well, I'm proud of you, Racy. But this is good, let's keep it going. Okay. For the past two years, I've been hitting opium pretty hard. What? I didn't actually blow up the Golden Gate Bridge. Okay, guess I'll go. I was nominated for a Tony when I was 12. I haven't washed my clothes in years. What? That's how I got the name Laundry. I never did it. Oh, honey, we can help you with that. Skinny Sally? Let's see. I murdered like three people in high school and I never got caught. Like, never. Well, Wrecka. I guess you'll be leading us to victory now. Okay. But somewhere else. Okay, Laundry, pick a song. Omi, Nosebleeder. All right, we can do this. Let's see. Paws in, ladies? One, two. What was that? I guess I haven't tried to go that low with the new throat yet. Hey, with the man throat, you could hit the bass notes! Yeah, she's all about that bass now! Thanks, Greg! Oh, and by the way, I learned how to beatbox over spring break. Sweet. Great. Yes. Welcome to the 2016 International Beats with Mouth Competition. This is the Stinkin Center, where all aca groups come to win it all. Let's hope there's not another fart fest. You've never been more right, Stale. Good luck. All right, guys, we suck, but in a good way. Okay, let's go do this. Well, would ya look at that? They've got my attention now. Sorry, Stale. No apology necessary, Swan. Well, Stale, it looks like my crush on you is over. I'll be getting some numbers after the show. That's a lot of five to seven, Swan, but go right ahead.
