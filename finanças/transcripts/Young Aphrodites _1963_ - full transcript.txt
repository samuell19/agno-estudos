YOUNG APHRODITES Written by Vassilis Vassilikos and Kostas Sfikas Cast: Takis Emmanuel Eleni Prokopiou Vaggelis Ioannidis Kleopatra Rota Editor: Giorgos Tsaoulis Cinematographer: Giovanni Varriano Music: Yannis Markopoulos Director: Nikos Koundouros Send me back to the hills. I can't go on anymore! Where is the boy? Look over here! Look women! We are willing to share the water. They call me Milon. I'd never be able to love a boy like you. It got away. It flew away... because I let it go. Why did you catch it? No reason. I put nets everywhere. We've been parched for water. You are fortunate here. Are there many of you here? More houses behind the rocks? Before now, no strangers have come. We see only women here. Are the men away? They are fishermen. On the way down from the hills, we lost our way. You want all those birds? Yes, I will set them free. If I caught them, I wouldn't free them. But I wouldn't fill the world with nets. Don't follow me. I don't like being looked at. Who's looking at you? I'm just walking along. Will your people be here long? I don't know. The women may come for water. We're shepherds, we don't bite. Don't come any closer, I don't like it. Why don't you like it? I don't want it. Afraid? My name is Tsakalos, we'll meet again. This belongs to you and me. And yet it's one day since we met. We know each other since yesterday. I don't even know who you are. And you stink like a sheep. I may stink but I'm not a sheep. And a bird is only a bird. It's not a bird - it's really me. And you're a stranger. A boy lights a fire for a girl when he wants her very much We light fires only to scare serpents away. Real men light fires for girls. There aren't any men I've seen do that. Where are your friends, hiding? The women are hiding. A present for you. It's not a present. It's mine anyway. They're all yours. I caught it for you. But how did you know I would come. I knew you would. Afraid of me, aren't you? I'm not here for you. This is my sanctuary. Now it's ours. Take your hand off me. I'll take down my nets and go away. You'll strangle it. Get on. I must go now. Why must you? Because I must. You came and you will go. But I must stay. Get off me. Get off, you're hurting me. This is the first time I've come to the sea. - We hill people don't like salty waters. - What happens if I stay with you? No one will know it. We plan to leave when it first rains. With the first rains, our men will be back. You have a man of your own? Yes. You've a husband, what do you want of me? I want nothing of you. Fisherman aren't easy people, they are not like us. You live a quiet life here? Yes. Is he good to you? He's good. Are we alone now? Yes. Lonesome a little? Do you miss him? What is that to you? - I don't care. I wondered if he's taken you in his arms. The way I want to. I belong to him, he does what he likes. At times when you are unwilling and shy does he ever make you lie down? I'm not shy. A woman is like an orchard. With no water, it dies. The water's now become ours. What's my name? Tsakalos, you frighten me with that mask. It's not a mask, it's my head. I love the queen. I'm not the queen at all, don't come closer. Anything you want. I will give it you. I want nothing, don't come so close. Your hair smells like flowers. - Don't go close, they might see. Let them see. You have nothing to do in the woods today. You came for me. Your neck is like a dove. Let me go, you're hurting me Tsakalos. If I bite you, will you scream? - What if I do? You're hurting me! I won't let you go. You shouldn't have come here at all. I'm a married woman, my man will come back. I know. - I've been thinking of him every minute. You don't think of him, you're afraid of him. Afraid of you. You're a stranger. I don't know you. You're a stranger too. I don't even know your name. You merely want me, only he loves me. If he loves you, why isn't he here? Every minute he waits to come back. He will take your pleasure. You will share the pleasure. It's different, you want me now, he wants me forever. Forever! Today I live, tomorrow I may die. With the first rains, we leave! I'm called Arta. Please take me with you. Are you crazy? We're strangers. I'll leave soon, you won't remember me. I won't burden you. I can cook and weave. I can do whatever I like with you. Scream. I don't care. Take me with you. I will belong to one man, you or he. I should have taken you hours ago. I wish I knew. It's you or he. You must decide. If it's a bird, I'll smother it. I mean it, I will smother it. I'm telling you for the last time. I will strangle it. No! A man lights a fire for a girl. When he wants her very much. I don't believe you. You'll have to prove to me that you really mean it. What should I do? Must I steal a ship for you? Or walk on stones til my feet bleed? What shall I do? I'm willing to do anything for you. Climb the mountain at night alone. And then you may do what you want. There's no one that will face that mountain alone. You must. But there are wild wolves at night. I asked you to go because there are wolves in the mountains. There are serpents. One needs a fire at night. I asked you because there are serpents on the mountain. You try to climb it at night alone. You don't know what you're saying. The others won't let me go anyhow. You mustn't tell anyone. And then you may do what you want. It will rain. Yes. It will rain. I don't want you to go. Come back. Come, let's go back. If you leave me, I'll die! Come here. Let's stop here. Why make things so difficult. Let's go back now. Let me know what you want, and I'll do it for you. You only care about beasts with four legs, don't you? You can't love me. But I do love you. What should I do? Come closer to me everyday. I'll come closer now. I meant a little at a time. Will you love me forever? Forever. You must promise. I promise. We've had the rain now. You will be leaving in the morning. I will stay. The others will go where they want. I'll hide and let them go. Just ask me to stay. Ask me to stay and you'll see. You won't stay. You came with them and you will go with them. Ask me to stay and you'll see. You mean forever? I mean forever. Why don't you go? The others have left. Why did you stay here? You'll get lost. This film was based on material found in the pastoral Idylles of Theocritus written in the Third Century B.C. And the classical ancient text of Longus' "Daphnis and Chloe". It was set in 200 B.C.
