This is a story that takes place on an island full of wonder. The story of two lost souls searching for one another, although they don't know that yet. Because, you see, no matter how alone or out of place one feels, magic is all around us if you just know where to look. Easy, girl. Hey, Mama. Good girl. Come on. We're gonna take good care of you. Come on. Let's go, gang. We're going to the pound. Come on, girl, you're okay. Come on, girl. Hey, Food Stamp. New girl. The last tenant put the unit on Airbnb. We don't play that 'cause we got rules. No subletting, no water beds and no pets. - Y'all got that? - Absolutely, Mr. Packard. We won't even drink water in bed. Hey, 5-C! If your mama wants her dishwasher repaired, tell her try a little grease. She'll know what I'm talking about. O-Okay, Mr. Packard. Yes, I know it's important and I wouldn't ask unless... Hey, Mom. Yeah, okay, I understand. Yeah, I'll figure it out. Okay, yeah. Thanks. Packard wants a bribe for the dishwasher. Splendid! Just grab a stack of hundreds. I think they're over there by the gold bars that Aunt Irene left us in this rent-controlled flat. How was your day, sweetheart? Somewhere between abysmal and atrocious. Those are two beautiful words, which you probably wouldn't use if you didn't go to such a good school. Great! I'll have an epic vocabulary to use in my upcoming decades of therapy. Okay. It is hard being the new kid at school. Those other girls still bothering you? It's mostly just this one girl, Florence. - She calls me "Food Stamp." - Why? Maybe because I'm on scholarship, or I'm small, or because we just moved here from upstate. - I don't know. - Well, you're different to those other kids at school. That's good. You know, people who are unique, they're the ones that change the world. Great! I'll tell Florence that. Just let me call her mother. We can have them over here, and we can all talk about it. My gosh, were you ever a child? No. Um, but I was bullied, too. You know, you just have to learn to stand up for yourself. Well, I guess I'm just not as brave as you. I don't want to stand out. I'm gonna go change and then I'll collect some more cans for the charity drive. Oh, did you talk to your boss about the Chicago thing? Okay, so, apparently, the case has been moved forward two weeks, and I'm the only paralegal who... Mom! I am so sorry. I'm just gonna be gone a couple of days. Really? Well, who's gonna stay with me? I'll get a lovely sitter. Yeah? Just not Uncle Casey. Are you kidding? Uncle Casey? Who thinks that green M&M's are vegetables? No, no, that is not an option. Mmm! Wh... Wh... Coming! Hey there. Sorry, I was just, uh, grabbing a little power nap, Officer Jackson. What's this you got going on in here? Oh, this is just a temporary thing. I'm in between apartments. Hmm. Your meter's expired. Actually, no, the meter is broken. Actually, no, it's working. It just had this bag over the top of it. - Oh! Who put that there? - Hmm. This city. It is so disheartening. I'll get rid of that. Do you want to give me that? Just to... Okay. No, I want to give you this. Can we do this later? I am so late. Okay. Give it to someone else! Pay it forward. Ooh. I'm okay. I'm so sorry. I've got to go. So late. Ah! Burn. Burn. Hi. Casey Porter here to see Mr. Harrington about the illustrator job. Hi. Yeah. That was at 3:30 and it's... Mm, it's 4:15. Wow. Pretty sure he said Mountain Time, so guess I'm early. No. Sorry. Okay, then, are these complimentary? Sadly, yes. Lunch. Idiot! - Hey! - Hey, Malik. I'm collecting cans and bottles for my school's fundraiser. - Do you have anything? - It's Malik the Magnificent now. I'm going to magic school. Hey, do you wanna see a trick? Sure. Okay, a deck of cards. Ooh. Fantastic. How about you, Mrs. Crullerman? Do you have any cans for me? You can have this one, malyshka. No, no! Moment. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Here. Condensed milk? Magic school. Good luck. Hey. You know, when I get really good at magic, you know what I'm gonna do? Make her disappear? No, I'm gonna cut her in half. Oh. Or that. - Hey, Mrs. Jarvis. - Hi, Emily. - Do you have any more cans for me? - I do. Does Packard know you're collecting canisters in his edifice? He'll insist on a retroactive commission. Not if we file a 501 in loco parentis. Then, she's protected. You guys must be good lawyers. Because I don't know what you're talking about. Hey, guys! Alonso! Get the cans for Emily! Hey, you do it! I'm busy. - I'm doing the tofu! - Eh! Emily, come check it out. We got regular, seasoned... What's there to know? It's the white stuff in the water. Here you go, Emily. Mira, mira... Two years ago, genius here cuts his hand off with a meat slicer. Now he's a tofu-eating vegan. It was a sign. Doggone it. Ah! Get out of here! There you are. Come on. Now, just because you're lost, it doesn't mean that you're any less of a treasure. You understand? Oh, standing up for yourself, are you? Yes, yes, I know. You're a dog. Ah! Hello. Now, let's introduce you to all the others, shall we? Hope they don't mistake you for a lobster. The whole block is bonkers. What? Why are you looking at me like that? You know I said I was gonna get a sitter. Yo, yo, yo! What up, fam? You promised. - How's my favorite sister? - Hey. And my favorite little niece? Money is gonna be in this drawer here. And emergency numbers here. "911"? Give me some credit. Till the super fixes it, please don't use the dishwasher. Emily has to be at school by 7:45. In the morning? What are they, farmers? Ooh, Mom won't be back till Monday. So, what are we doing? "Get a little crew together? Hit up the club?" Isn't that what you young people say? We don't say that. Ever. - "Get lit?" - Please stop. All set to go. Now, Casey, I'm really counting on you. Are you sure you can handle this? You're bloody well right I can. You see, if I hadn't moved here when I was two, I would've grown up with a British accent also. Bollocks. Rubbish. Collywobbles. Are you finished? Dumbledore. - I love you. - Love you. Look, Mags, I got this, okay? Got the keys? - You've been here two minutes! - I may have lost those. Um, okay, this is my only other set. - Okay. - Do not lose those. - I love you guys. - Love you. Cheerio! Shocking. Ah. So, how's everything going in, I'm gonna say fourth grade? Sixth. Joking. Where's your sense of humor? I lost it. On the subway. I lost you one time. Okay, twice if you count Atlantic City. But I won you back! Hey! I'm gonna make it up to you, okay? We're gonna do something super cool this weekend. Money is absolutely no object. As long as there's enough of it in that drawer. How are there so many people up at this hour? Hey, you want to get a coffee? I'm twelve. I'm not allowed to drink coffee. - Red Bull? - Really? Whew! Being a kid sucks. Oh, my gosh. Look, there's an animal rescue tent! Can we go in? Please? My instinct is, "Sure", so we probably shouldn't? But how could I say no to that little face with those cheeks and the, ah, missing tooth? I just want to dust you in sugar... - Okay, okay, enough. - Okay, okay. Come on! Wow. So beautiful. - Hi! - Hi. Hi. Well, you're kind of creepy. Ah! Sorry! - Whoa. - Whoa. Hi. Oh, my goodness. Whoa! Uncle Casey, there's a sloth! Oh. Hey. My spirit animal. - Whoa. - Don't touch that. Aw. Why would you put that there? - Shoo. Go away. - Look at you! Splendid backpack! - It matches. - Cool. Well, you are obviously a young lady - of immaculate taste. - Thank you. Bridwell's the name, and welcome to my Tentus Animalus Rescuus. Is that Latin for "Animal Rescue Tent"? No, it's just regular words with "us" on the end. Makes me sound smartus. So, what sort of animals are you looking for? A temperamental tortoise? A stand-up chameleon? Maybe something small, cheap and stuffed? I want them all. Ah, yeah, we're not really looking for a pet. Perfect! Follow me. The thing about animals is that the best time to find them is when you're not looking for them. Huh, does this tent seem bigger on the inside? That's ridiculous! It's smaller on the outside. Is that a baby giraffe? Or a long-necked hyena. I can't be sure till I tell it a joke. Giraffes have no sense of humor. Here we are. This is it. - There's no animals in here. - That's right. You said you weren't looking for a pet. And we're not. So you won't be interested in him. Who? My goodness. You're just the cutest thing I've ever seen. Look at you. Aw. I got you. Oh, he's so cute. And... And so tiny. And so red. I love that he's red. How did he get that way? I don't know. I found him in the park trying to be a pigeon. I think he's lost his family, so he's a little confused. Poor guy. - I'll be your family. - No, you will not. Please, Uncle Casey? He's so tiny, he wouldn't bother anyone. Mr. Bridwell, how big is he gonna get? - Well, that depends, doesn't it? - On what? On how much you love him. Okay. Adorable. Put him back. Please, just look at this little tiny face. I'm sorry. I'm new, responsible Casey now, and letting you get a little radioactive micro-dog is not responsible. So give him back. No, I'm not gonna fall for that again. Give me the dog. Be careful. Well, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to crush my niece's dreams. I always wondered what it felt like to be the bad guy. My pleasure. Oh, by the way, do you know what sound porcupines make when they kiss? "Ouch!" Ah! Hyena. Okay, come on. Let's get you to school. No word of this to anyone. OMG, did you bring your garbage to school? No, this is the recycling. For the fund raiser? Isn't that today? Yeah, but nobody actually does it. The school just wants the money. - My mom wrote a check. - Mine, too. Classic Food Stamp. Hey! Don't listen to her. She's just cranky because a house fell on her wicked sister. I think it's awesome you actually did the work. Really makes you stand out around here. It was one of the last things I was hoping to do, but thank you. - It's Owen, right? - You know my name? Did I say that out loud? Well, if it makes you feel any better, I collected cans, too. Really? Where are they? My dad threw them away. Said I looked like an Asian Oliver Twist. Oh, good job, Emily! Come on in, we're starting. Can we get a cleanup on aisle four? Don't worry, Emily. We'll get this cleaned up. Another company looking to make its mark through genetically-enhanced agricultural products is Lyfegro and its famous uncompromising genius of a founder, Zac Tieran. "Famous". That's really nice to hear. Hey, Em! How was your day? Good talk. We are going to reveal something that is going to blow your mind. Nothing? What? What the... Hey, it's you! How did you get in there? You were in my bag all day? They're gonna think I stole you. Who put you in here? Oh, my gosh, you are just the cutest thing I've ever seen. Maybe you could stay for a little while, right? Mr. Bridwell didn't tell me your name. So maybe you don't have one. What about something cool and old-fashioned? Like... Floyd! No? Okay. Um, Ebenezer! Sorry. Um, Ishmael. It's from the Bible. No. Clifford. You like Clifford? Clifford it is. Perfect for you. Shh! No. Uncle Casey will hear you. Clifford, where'd you go? What... Hey, there's my retainer. You hungry, boy? Come on. Perfect. Clifford, no! Those are my brand-new slippers. Clifford! Clifford, no, give it back. Really? I'm gonna call you Ebenezer if you act like this. Come on, drop it. Drop it, Clifford. Good boy. Clifford? Clifford! Where are you? Do you like turkey, Em? Hmm. Where'd you go? Oh, no. You. - You didn't. - I didn't! I found him in my backpack. I specifically said no to the dog and you completely ignored me. I swear, he just showed up. Oh, it just "showed up", huh? - What is that? What are you doing? - Air quotes. It's a thing that grown-ups do when they say something that they don't mean. Please, Uncle Casey, can't he just stay for one night? No! Absolutely not. I promised your mom. No, please. I'm not gonna fall for your little girl powers. Oh! Okay, one night. And then, first thing in the morning, he is going back to that weird old man that we met in the animal tent. Mm, saying that out loud makes us going in there seem like such a poor choice. Why? I don't understand. Why can't I just keep him? Because you can't have a dog! One night. That's it. Don't you... I wish we were big and strong, and the world couldn't hurt us. Oh, my gosh. Clifford? Wait, wait. I'm going to wake up. It's all in my head. I'm dreaming. I'm going to wake up in three, two... Oh, my gosh, I'm not dreaming. This is real. Clifford, it's really you. How did this happen? How are you so huge? I mean, it's crazy, but it's great. I did wish for you to be big, but I didn't mean big on the outside. I meant, like, mentally big. Clifford. What are you doing? No! My bed! Clifford, no, that's my mom's pillow! Clifford, drop it. Come on, be a good boy and drop it. Give it back! Ew! Bless you. Oh, no! My computer! Don't wag your tail. Sit, boy, sit. Clifford! Clifford, just be quiet, stay here, okay? Shh. I'll be right back, okay? Just shh, shh, shh. Casey! Casey! Casey! - The meter's broken. - Casey! It's 7:30. Huh! We're gonna be late for school. - Casey. - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up! Um, about the dog... You know, I've been thinking about that. And I don't want to be the no guy. That's just not who I am. So if you really want to keep that weird little thing, then it's fine with me. - So I can keep him? - You just got to tell your mom I knew nothing about it, okay? You snuck it back here, you hid it from me. I had no idea it was here. - I don't know if she's gonna believe that. - She is. The thing is tiny. It's completely plausible that I would... Run! Come on. We got to get out of here! - There's a monster in the apartment! - Casey, this is the dog... Uncles and children first! Stay back! Stay back. ...from the tent. But last night it was... - Yeah, I think something happened to him. - You think? He's the same dog he was last night, he's just a little bit bigger. "A little bit bigger." It is the size of a hippopotamus. Listen, he's not gonna hurt you, okay? He's harmless. He's the same dog he was last night. Stay. Oh, God. It's your mom. What am I gonna say? I don't know. Uh. Just act natural. Act natural. Shoo. Stay still. What is happening? Okay. Remember. Natural. Hey, girl. - It's Maggie. - I know, girl. Why do you keep calling me "girl"? What? That's just a thing that I say when I'm super chill. I just wanted to call to make sure you were on the way to school. - We're walking to the subway now. - Clifford, no! - Not gonna lose her this time. - That's not funny. You're right, that incident is not something we should joke about. - Clifford, no! Whoa! - But we are being so safe right now. What is that noise? Nothing. But we're at our stop. Uh, bye, girl! - Get up. - Okay, bye. Okay. You, sit. No, don't say that! Somehow I thought you'd be better in a crisis. We are finding that Bridwell guy immediately. Why? So we can get rid of that. But you just said I could keep him. Yeah, that was before he 'roided up. Oh, come on. How is there nothing on this guy? He doesn't even show up on Google. "Bridwell's Animal Rescue"... nothing! You can't give people pets that go nuclear and then not be on the Internet. That is so irresponsible. Even by my standards. Oh! - That means he likes you. - Oh, great. - Who is it? - Packard. Oh, no, it's our psycho super. We can't have pets in the building... we'll get evicted! I'm here to fix the dishwasher. - Coming in! - One second! Not on my watch. Hide the dog. Hey, hey. I can handle this. Oh! Maybe I should do my English accent. No! Hello. You must be Mr. Packard. Who are you? Uh, Casey. Um, Maggie's sister. Brother. - Um, this is not a great time. - It's now or never. Never? Well, what the heck is going on in here? Oh, we were just doing a little feng shui. It's Chinese for "moving things." The dishwasher's right there. Yeah, but the water cutoff is in the bedroom closet. - Don't... Don't go in here. - No. Why not? - It's private. - It's haunted. There's a lot of girl stuff in there that I wouldn't want you to see. Yeah. - I can do it, though. - Yeah! Thanks, Uncle Casey. Just get in there and give it a little... - You know, he's family. - Yeah. So, the, um... So, the dishwasher! So, it makes, like, this weird crackling noise when it drains. Shh. No, no, no. Stop! Everything's under control! Just shutting off the valve. Whoa! Must be these old pipes, huh? What the heck is going on in there? So you are going into my room now! Okay. I smell dog. Dog? No, um... That is just me. I don't believe in deodorant. Why mask our natural essence? In fact, we should smell each other. - Bring it in. - Mmm, no. No! Okay. What are you doing? Yeah, I think I found the problem. I got to order a part. And I will have to return. Well, thank you very much for coming. You are a super super. Ow. - Bye! - Bye now! Thank you! This is the craziest thing I have ever seen, and I've been to Burning Man. If we can't find Bridwell, how are we gonna return him? Good boy, Clifford. Wait, return him? We can't abandon him. We're all he's got. We just need to make him small again. He needs to see a vet. - A vet? - Yeah. We don't know what's going on with him. What if he's really sick? What if he's still growing? What if he grows to be a hundred feet tall? Okay. We'll take him to a vet. But after that, we are finding Bridwell and we are giving him back... Whoa! ...his giant dog. Come on. Nice job with the belts. Lucky your mom went through the Madonna phase in the '80s, huh? Madonna? Uh, shouldn't we try to hide him or something? Nah. It's New York. No one'll even notice. No, no. I don't care if it's Johnny Appleseed, don't touch my petunias. - You live here? - Haven't you ever seen a mobile home before? Not like this one. My girlfriend and I broke up, and what with my college loans, I... - Mmm-hmm. - Look, this is a valid, financially responsible life choice which your mother does not need to know about. Okay? Oh, you're judging me as well. - In. - Come on, boy. Just down the front here. No, oh! Or stick your big fat butt right on my bed. No! Clifford. Clifford, don't slobber on his financially responsible life choice. Emily! Owen. What are you doing here? I thought you were sick, so I was gonna bring you your homework. And I also skipped P.E. Which I'm suddenly realizing makes me look a lot more desperate than I anticipated. - So you're not sick. - No, we're going to the vet. Don't you need an animal for that? Dogzilla! - No! - Is that a dog? It's okay! Nothing to see here, folks, just a big red puppy. Nothing to be afraid of. In. We're trying to keep this quiet until we can get him small again. So... - Shh. - This is so cool. You guys got to let me come. This is the kind of education you can't get in a classroom. I've seen TED talks about this. Sorry, pal. I got enough on my plate keeping one kid alive. There is no way... Okay, I guess he's coming with. Don't you dare. Clifford, no. No fetch. No fetch! Clifford! Huh? Oh, no. No, no, no! Bad doggy! - That's a good boy! - Clifford, no! Bad dog. Oh! How has he not popped that yet? Ah. There we are. Clifford, put him down. Drop the ball. - Drop the ball! - Clifford, drop it. - Unbelievable. - Good boy. No, bad boy. Very bad boy. He's cute. Right over here. What is he doing? What is he doing? Uh-oh. - Awesome. - Not awesome. Oh! Oh, I hope I'm not around for number two. Yesterday's TV interview - was brilliant, Mr. Tieran. - Thank you. I mean, I don't want to have high expectations, but I'm excited about what I'm gonna see. Uh, well, unfortunately, Mr. Tieran, we haven't seen exactly the kind of genetically induced growth we were hoping for. That's a two-headed goat. We're trying to feed the world and you're creating more mouths to feed? - I guess you could look at it that way. - Oh, I am. And it's looking back at me with four eyes. That's a little unsettling. What's our goal? - Well, to feed the world. - Stop talking. Our goal is to grow giant food through genetic engi... How much money have we spent? Is it... $400 million. - That is so much money, huh? - I know! - Surely you have something to show for it. Right? - Well... - So far, sir, not... - I heard a "so far." - Did you hear "so far"? - I heard "so far". And what that tells me is we have not failed. We just have not succeeded so far! - Can I get an amen? - Amen! Not you. I was talking to them. So with that $400 million, what have we produced? Larger chickens, cows that poop chocolate, what? - Why don't I just show you? - Oh! That is what I like to hear, okay? Well, this sheep at least has one head. That's a bonus. And what do we have here? Thicker wool that shears itself? Fur that smells like Santa Claus? What? Uh, not exactly. - We included her because she's m... - Why, Albert? - She's m... - She's what? She's... mean. She's mean? She's nasty. Well, now you're just lying to me. - No. - You're telling me that this gentle, sweet... Neat, huh? Kinda cool? That's not cool. Stop it! This is my childhood! Mr. Tieran? Colette. Yes. From the look on your face, I'm assuming you have more good news. You need to see this. That can't be real. It's all over the Internet. There's a ten-foot dog in upper Manhattan. Oh, my... - I smell your hair. - Sorry. Whatever made this dog grow could make our food grow. And then save Lyfegro. Please find him. Yes! Is he all right? Eh, yeah, um, eh, well... He's, uh... um, well... Whoo! Are you gonna examine him? Yes. I am. Because I'm a veterinarian! That's what I do, I examine... animals. I'm gonna take a look inside your mouth, buddy. Oh, easy. You want to maybe tell him? - Oh, yeah. Clifford. - That's not gonna... Good boy. Oh, maybe have a little more faith in the kiddies. Good job there, buddy. All right, let me take a look there. Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Yeah! Yes, they're large teeth on a big red dog. Is that a medical opinion? It sounded very scientific. All right, yeah, so, why don't we get you on the scale, bud? But slowly! Oh! It's just the platinum edition of the X-9000. - Yeah, sorry about that. - No problem. I'm just gonna write... "heavy." All right. Yeah, why don't you take his temperature? What? Why? I... - You know him a little better. - Uh... - Where? - You know. No, I don't "know" because I'm not a vet. Well, in the animal temperature-taking place? - Which is... - Rhymes with "nut-hole." - No way. - You don't wanna... Yeah, we're not gonna do that. Don't even worry about that, Clifford. - Why don't I just listen to his heart? - Yes! - That! Yes. - Let's do that. Let's do that. I'm gonna listen to your heart now, buddy. All right, here we go. Oh. Yeah! Clifford, Clifford, Clifford, Clifford... Oh, sorry. Well, I mean, I got to say, besides being big and red, this dog is healthy as, - well, healthy as a horse. - So you don't know what made him grow like this? I'm sorry, I don't. Live near a toxic waste dump? On top of a burial ground? - I saw this movie... - Okay, I think we're done here. All right. Crazy idea: How about we leave Clifford here with this professional until, I don't know, your mom comes home? And if he hasn't shrunken back to a normal size, then you can figure it out without me. - Casey! - That is cold. Why don't I finish up the examination? You guys can just go wait in the other room. - All right. Thank you so much. - Thanks. All right, let's do the easy part now and get you out of here, Clifford. That's one big handsome fella you got there. Why, thank you. Sign here. Very good, very good. Yeah, who wants a treat, huh? You want a treat? There you go, buddy. Yeah. Good job. Okay. No, no, you'll get another treat in a little while. Another treat in a little while. You'll get it in a little... Thank you. You know, I've got to say, I've never seen a dog that big before. He was tiny last night. Really? - You didn't happen to get him from Bridwell, did you? - How'd you know? Sweetheart, I have been working in this office for more than 20 years. Whenever anyone brings a unique animal in, it always seems to come from Bridwell. This one guy couldn't speak a word until Bridwell gave him a parakeet. That bird kept repeating positive affirmations daily. Now the guy can't stop talking! Another woman, she couldn't walk. She couldn't even move! Bridwell gave her a spider monkey. - Every night... - Lucille, help! ...it massages her feet, and since then, she's taken up tap dancing. - Wow, this guy's like a wizard! - Do you think he could make Clifford small again? Are you kidding? That's nothing for a man like Bridwell. The guy could perform miracles! - How do we find him? - You don't. He's more of the there-when-you-need-him type of guy. What do you do, say his name three times and rub a lamp? So cute. Have you got any information on your computer? - What kind of dumb question is that? - Dumb question? He just suggested rubbing a lamp. That's it! I know how to find him. Bridwell was at our school yesterday. He set up his tent there. So that must mean he had to fill out paperwork with his info on it. - So the information is on the school's computer. - Exactly! We hit the school fast, get the info on Bridwell, and we bounce. I'll get Clifford something to eat. Is it safe to leave the keys up there? Who's gonna want to steal this? Sometimes you pray for a miracle to save your company from ruin, and then you actually get it! But we don't have him yet, sir. Oh, come on, it's hard to hide a ten-foot red dog, Colette. And what is this? - It's an I.D. chip. - It's an I.D. chip. And when this little guy finds its way into our new large friend... ...the dog becomes Lyfegro's property. And red becomes my new favorite color. Mr. Tieran. - What? - Sir? - Yeah. - Take a look at this. This girl appears with the dog - in 67% of the images that we've examined. - Oh, that's unfortunate. Now, I've traced the crest on her uniform to an elite private school. Ugh! That's a litter of terrible. - And... - Oh. All right. "Emily Elizabeth Howard." Bingo! Hey, that is a lovely broach! Could you break a 20? There's kids in the hall selling peanut brittle, and I got a thing for P britty. - Peanuts? Ugh! - Yeah. Just down the hall. Far as you can go! She does not like peanuts. Nice job. I'll lift the intel... stealth mode. They'll never even know we were here. That would've sounded so much cooler if you weren't holding a SpongeBob flash drive. Shh. Working. Charming. Hello, good sir! How are you? I'm gonna guess that you're either the superintendent or you're a part of the New York Lantern Preservation Society. - What do you want, smart aleck? - Okay. I need some information on one of your tenants, please. Well, if you think I'm gonna divulge some confidential infor... There we are. - What do you need to know? - Yes. If you could just let me know if you've seen these beings. I knew I smelled a dog. And one more, please. Thanks. Stay! Stay, stay! Dog! Oh! What the heck? Hey, Food Stamp. Thought you weren't here today. Hi, Florence. Oh, you know, if you need extra food for home, I'm sure we could organize a food drive or something. I'm kind of in a rush. Do you know how much this blouse cost? I'm sorry. It was an accident. You're an accident! You shouldn't even be here. Why do you get to come here for free when everybody else has to pay? Clifford! How'd you get in here? That's the dog all over Instagram! Is that Emily's dog? Come on, let's go. Clifford, what? What are you doing? Why are you pushing me? Can we pet him? Um, sure. This is my dog, Clifford. - How is he so big? - He's so cute. I love him! Oh, this is perfect. The biggest nobody in school has the biggest freak in the world. - I guess freaks of a feather... - He's not a freak! What did you say to me? You're just mad 'cause he stole all the attention from you. Whoa! Well, that means he likes you. Burn! Okay, time to go. Yes, definitely time to go. Okay. We can't risk Packard seeing Clifford. Owen, you stay in the truck. Wait a minute. What... Oh, and maybe get Clifford some water. Thanks. Okay, we plug into your laptop, download the info on Bridwell, and then get out of here. Oh, my God. - No. - We're evicted? This can't be happening. Now I've really done it. This looks very complicated, Mr. Jarvis! I'm not even sure if you're on the right step for what I was reading you. Did you even read the legal disclaimer on self-installation? Certainly, Mrs. Jarvis! In what world would I ever... Somebody help! Somebody help him, please! Somebody help! Clifford! What are you doing? - Priscilla! - Jeron, please! - Somebody grab a ladder! - Somebody! - Clifford! - He's slipping! Jeron, please! Hold on, man! Help, please! Jeron! You just got fetched by a big red dog! That was incredible! Thank you. Whose giant dog is this? It's Emily's! It's Emily's dog. Emily! Your dog just saved my life! Clifford? Hey, Emily, did you see that? It was the greatest Frisbee catch ever! Clifford, good boy. Good boy. Thank goodness. This is my dog, Clifford, and that's my Uncle Casey. Wait, Packard lets you have this dog? Um, not exactly. But we're trying to figure it out. Oh, Owen, we couldn't get the computer. We were completely locked out. - Really? - Yeah. All right, I'll try to figure something out. Thanks. - Excuse me? - Yes. Can me and Emily borrow your computer? Of course you may. Let me take some action shots - as I'm walking with him. - Yeah? It's not your fault. Oh, it is my specialty. Screwing stuff up for your mom. I bet you didn't know your mom got a scholarship to Oxford. - She did? - Yeah. Wanted to go back to England for college. And then our mom died, Dad went to pieces. So she stayed here to help raise me. She sacrificed everything. This is how I repay her: "Surprise! You're homeless." That's why no one ever believes in me, Em. Holy cow! Guys! I got into the file! I found a letter that Bridwell sent to the school. But check this out: One of the days he said he wasn't available is tomorrow. Because he's gonna be at St. Benedict's Hospital for a prior appointment. - So we can find Bridwell tomorrow! - Exactly. I'll be right back. We've got eyes on her. - Mrs. Jarvis! - What? No. Have you not listened to a word that I've said? - Emily, we're not playing this game anymore. This is over. - No. We're calling Animal Control, a zoo, a carnival, whatever. Oh! Hello! You must be Emily Elizabeth. Who are you? I'm Zac Tieran, from Lyfegro. It is so nice to meet you. Here's my card. You are a lifesaver, young lady. I cannot thank you enough for finding our dog. - Your dog? - One of our clumsy janitors left the gate open and this large fella slipped away from the lab, didn't ya, big guy? Okay. So, I'm sure he has been a huge inconvenience, so if I may, I would like to offer you this. I'm really coming around to this guy. - Hold on. - All right. Well, don't hold on. We... - Can I have a minute? - Sure. - What are you doing? - Ugh, I hate children. This fixes everything. Clifford goes home, we bribe our way back into the apartment, no one knows any of this ever happened, and, well, I will take a very small babysitting fee off the top. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. You're lying. - Excuse me? What? - Ah, that's a little strong. You said when Clifford escaped he was big. I found him when he was small. Oh. That's weird. Everything okay, Emily? - Hold your roll. - I was talking to Emily, my friend. - Everything's fine. - Well, good. I'm Alonso with the Neighborhood Watch. - We're watching you! But we're not seeing much. - Oh. I tried to be nice. Albert! Sorry. Thank you. Clifford, run! - No. No, no, no! - Emily! Get him! Get him! We need backup, now! - Clifford! Come here, boy! - Come on! - Come, everybody! - What do I pay you people for? In there! Go! - Oh, no. - Get into the truck! Go! - Okay. - Hurry, let's go! Clifford, come on, we got to get to the truck! - Come on! - Come on, come on! Help me block the door. That'll hold them. Chips! - Don't make me hurt you. - Alonso! Raul! Oh, my bad. There! What are you doing? - I'm getting Clifford out of here. - You know how to drive? If Casey can do it, how hard can it be? Oh, Lord. Try that stick thingamabobber. My dad uses it sometimes. Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Okay, not "R". This is both unsafe and illegal! That's two firsts for me. Oh. - Ow! - Sorry. Whew. - I... I am sure we're fine. - No, we're not fine. We're not fine! We're not fine! Her mother is literally gonna kill me. This truck doesn't have airbags. Please keep that in mind while we're crashing. Cops! Be cool. What are you doing? Two hands on the wheel! Two hands! Even I know that! Two hands! - They're coming! - Uh, take a left! Take a left! Whoa! That's my building up ahead! Garage is open. Turn left right here! The garage is right there! Turn now! Whoa! Okay. Let's never do that again. You have the toxicity reports, right? Yes, I do. It's Emily's school. Just one... Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Oh, hi, Mrs. McKinley. Hi, Maggie. I just wanted to check on Emily, see how she's feeling - since she wasn't in school today. - What? Oh, for the love of Mike! Siobhan, he's with us. Put the Swiffer down. Are you insane? You're driving now? What are you upset about? I still can't get my butt cheeks to unclench! Where are we? Is this a museum? It's just a pied-à-terre. You live here? Yeah. Oh, geez. - Your turn. - What? I don't know what to say! I'd go with anything but the truth. Hey, girl! Emily, I just got a call from the school, and they said that you weren't there today. What? That's crazy talk, girl! Of course I was at school. - Okay. - You know what? Casey can explain. You're a better liar than me. Hey! There must have been some confusion at the office. I heard they had a peanut scare today. But I will straighten it out Monday. No problemo. Brutus! No! - Is that a dog? - A dog? What? No. No. No. It's the, uh, dishwasher. Just try kicking it. I think he wants to smell Clifford's... you know. Okay. Hey, Brutus. Look, there. It stopped. You know... He done? Good boy. By the way, have you thought about finding a new apartment? It might be time for a change. Uh, sorry. Just checked my phone battery. It's on, like, 1% if you lose me. Whoa! Brutus! Well, you don't see that every day. Brutus. He's okay. He's okay. Really? Maybe it's time to feed him. Okay, first of all, thank you so much for seeing us, Captain. - Chief. - Sure, of course. - You telling me this dog is yours? - Absolutely. We were in the middle of an experimental trial when it escaped. This creature is a medical mutant. - Medical mutant? - That's right. And I'm worried that this mutation could potentially jump species. Jump species? We need to capture this animal and return it to my lab as soon as possible or the consequences could be catastrophic. Picture this, okay? You're going outside. - Cockroaches that size... - Ugh! ...flying around the air! Okay? Rats that size walking around the grocery store with you. Flying rats. - Flying rats! - Fl... - Let me make a call. - Great, make a call. He eats like an animal. Well, he is an animal. I'm talking about him. What? - We take you to breaking news. - Hey, guys. Look! I'm Chief Watkins, New York City Police Department. We are offering a $25,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of the big red dog. - The safety of the citizens... - And look who's there. ...of New York is our primary concern. We are currently working in conjunction with Lyfegro. That is a very slappable face. Please, if you see something, say something. - Owen! I'm home! - Any questions? Dad! Hey! Who are you? Um, this is Casey and that's Emily. - Emily? - Yeah. - As in the Emily? - Dad! Sorry. He's never mentioned you. Ever. Not once. So, can they spend the night? They've got a problem. What's the problem? I withdraw the question. Your dad owns this place? Yeah, it's, um, 500 acres. A lot of space, tons of animals. - It's perfect for Clifford. - And it's thousands of miles away. Em, the cops are after us. Okay, bye. Okay, so things are falling into place. My shipping company has a freighter docked in Newark. Leaves for Hong Kong tomorrow night. Owen showed you our place outside Shanghai. It's fully staffed. Clifford would be safe. We're not gonna send Clifford away. - Emily. - We're not doing that! Thank you, Mr. Yu. Would you mind if I spoke with Emily alone? Of course. Come on, Owen, I'll tuck you in. Dad! I never tuck him in. Ever. Let's go, big man. - Good night. - Bye, guys. We're having words about that debacle. Debacle? - China's not that far away. - Really? Okay, that's a terrible lie. It is very far away. But this is definitely what's best for him. I don't care. Clifford came to me when I was alone and had no friends. He's the best part of my life. I'm not gonna abandon him. We don't have a choice. We've been evicted. And now, according to the news, we're, like, actual fugitives. Bridwell could help us! You heard Lucille at the vet's office. He can do it! We just need to find him. - Emily... - Casey, what if you found someone who was so full of love they made you feel like you could do anything? How would you feel if you had to let that go? Okay. We'll go to the hospital, look for Bridwell. But if we can't find him, or he can't help, Clifford's got to get on that boat tomorrow night. Deal? Deal. Looks like we're on the couch, T-bone. Whoa. This place is $27 mil on Zillow? Hey, T-bone, does Owen have an older sister? Okay. Just asking for a friend. Understood. Dude. Forget I asked. Okay. Owen, you stay with Clifford. We'll go find Bridwell. Why do you always leave me behind? Because it's the kind of education you can't get in a classroom. Act natural. Clifford, you sense things. You sense any chemistry between me and Emily? Because I sense... Clifford, gross! This is what killed the dinosaurs! There are rules! You can't let one rip in confined space! Okay, Clifford, that was really uncool. Clifford! Get in the truck. Are you looking for someone? Yeah. Um, older guy, silver hair. Tall. Kinda speaks in riddles. That... That's his tie! He wears a polka-dot bow tie. - Oh. - What? The man with that tie? Your friend? He passed away this morning. No. That's impossible. I'm sorry. He was so kind and magical. How could he die? If there's a memorial, I could email or something. Yeah, thanks. Uh, here you go. What about Clifford? I can't believe it. Bridwell was our only hope. I bet that's for us. It'll be fine. Come on. I just can't believe that Bridwell is, you know. We can go back to my apartment and hide. Owen, the New York City Police force is after us. There's no more hiding. If they find us, they're gonna hand Clifford over to Tieran. So what do we do? - No. - Em. I'm not gonna give him up! We've got to do what's best for him. I'm what's best for him. Not if you can't keep him safe. Call your father. All right, everything's been arranged. Colin will stay with Clifford from the tug to the freighter, then all the way to Shanghai. He'll be met at the port by my staff, and they'll bring him to the house. Come on, guys, we got to get going! Mr. Yu, we can't thank you enough. You're welcome. Bye, Clifford. I hope to see you again someday. Okay, go wait in the car. - I'm sorry it worked out like this, Emily. - Thank you. Hey. I know you don't understand, Clifford. It's just... It's not safe for you here. You're just too big. And if they find you, they'll do really bad things to you. I can't let that happen. There are no other dogs like you. And people, they just... They don't like things that are different. What's the matter? What's he doing? I think he's trying to be small. I'm sorry I let you down, Clifford. I thought I could save you and I couldn't. We have to be big and strong. Remember? So that the world can't hurt us. You have to go with these men now. It'll be okay. Hey, hey. Real proud of you. Bye, Clifford! I love you with all my heart! Be good for me, okay? Apparently, the county was sued in 1994. - Maggie! Is that Emily? - What? ...leading to the capture of this Internet sensation. - The city-wide search continues in New York City... - What's the matter? - ...for the big red dog. - That's my daughter. He was last seen in Harlem. - You go, yes. - Yeah. Didn't get much sleep, huh? Breakfast? I know you don't drink coffee, but feels like now might be the time to start. He's gonna be happy there. You know who's not gonna be happy? My mom. Living in a van. Nah, I think she'll get used to the van life. Sleeping on the floor. Peeing in a bucket. I woke up to some fun texts from her this morning. Yeah. "Please call, right now." All caps, exclamation, angry face, angry face, gun emoji. Do you think she might be mad? You want to finish getting ready? The maid comes around ten. Ah, guy from the hospital sent the info on Bridwell's memorial. I don't want to see it. Wait a sec. That does not look like Bridwell. It's probably just him when he was younger. Meh. That's not Bridwell. Not Bridwell. Definitely not Bridwell. The patient in the hospital must've got the wrong guy. So if that's not Bridwell, that means... Bridwell's alive! This guy's dead, which is tragic, but Bridwell's alive. - Bridwell is alive! - Yeah! Feels weird high-fiving the dead! - There's still hope for Clifford! - Let's focus on that. - Yes. - R.I.P. Hamilton Wilder. - Long live Bridwell! - Yes! - Guys! - Owen, Bridwell's alive! Online... I researched... I found... Bridwell... the park. Okay. Again. With sentences. Bridwell is alive, and his tent is in Manhattan Bridge Park at the Freedom Festival. Emily! Emily! Come quick! The giant crimson dog was stopped earlier this morning - by the authorities on a freighter. - Can you believe this? - What? - No one is certain how or why he got aboard, but it seems an effort was being made to transport him out of the country. The enormous dog is being returned to his home at Lyfegro labs, the biotech firm that created him. No! No, we have to help Clifford. Uncle Casey, we have to save him. They'll hurt him! Yeah. We do. I guess we're paying Lyfegro a visit. I'm in. I'll go get the van. We're in. Looks like Harlem wants its big red dog back. - Guess who. - Let me talk to her. - Hi, Mom! - Emily, what on earth is going on? - Clifford's in trouble. - I'm in the taxi on the way from JFK. - There's no time to explain. - Everybody, get in! - I am an hour away... - Mom, I can handle this. - Handle what? You're twelve years old. - I got this. - And besides, Uncle Casey's with me. - And I am so sorry, but, my darling, you... Emily? I'm grounded for life, aren't I? You and me both. It's in Brooklyn Yards, off Vanderbilt. Okay, I'll meet you over there. Hey! Get out of my way. They should have left that dog alone. Ooh. Now they're in trouble. All right, let's start sequencing its DNA. Yeah, okay, sir. Hello! How are you? Who's a good boy? It's okay. Good morning. I got a speech, but what I have to say comes from the heart, and I apologize if I get emotional. We here at Lyfegro, we've got one mission. It's to feed the world. Hey, Mark, I like your tie. We have an illustrious team of scientists... Okay. Whoa! You carry bolt cutters? Never leave the house without 'em. You live in a truck. Zip it, Owen. And to prove that, I'm sure you saw that beautiful, magnificent creature walking by, who... playfully escaped from our lab two days ago. And I tell ya, we are very, very thankful for that big red dog. Okay. Now we just need a diversion. - We can handle that. Right, Mr. Jarvis? - Yes, we can, Mrs. Jarvis. We'll head around back. We'll go make some trouble at the press conference. You have an opportunity to make a sizeable return on Lyfegro's investment. - Thank you so much. - Uh, Mr. Tieran. - Mr. Tieran! - Yes. Will you please address the lawsuit that's being filed against you? Lawsuit? I don't... It's locked. Don't worry. I got a solution. - We learned how to pick locks in magic class. - I bet you did. We'll be filing a class-action lawsuit against Mr. Tieran, Lyfegro Research Facilities, - and any and all... - Guys, we've got bogies. Yeah, I don't speak legalese. We've already named Emily Elizabeth Howard as head class representative, and we've attached an assault and battery claim, inclusive of ethical violations. - Hey, let me go. Get your hands off her! - This is unfortunate. This is way too focused on me. Look at that! What is the matter with you? You're gonna set off the fire alarm! There's another one. Just... - Security inside the building, what's going on? - Go, go, go. - Check all the doors! - Yes, sir! On it. Doing it now. What's going on? Ah, look. It's a cute sheep. Look. Holy sheep. - I'm out. - Step aside. I know sheep. Come here, mamachka. Come to mama. Yeah, come here, come here. You see? Everybody likes condensed milk. Go get it. Yes, even the can tastes good, doesn't it? Sectors three through five clear. It's a false alarm at the loading dock. Copy that. False alarm at the loading dock. Resetting all systems. - Whoa! - Clifford! Sorry, my friends, we're taking the dog. I've got 30,000 volts that says you're not. - I've got a plastic hand. - But I have a real one. No! - Oh! - It's heavy because it's condensed, tovarishch. Okay, anyone in a lab coat... ...take a hike. Okay. Huh. Clifford! Are you okay? Clifford. Clifford? Clifford! You're okay! Clifford, buddy. I know, I know. Aw! - Hey, buddy. I'm happy, too. - I don't want to break this up because it is, like, the most adorable thing I've ever seen, but how are we gonna get him to Bridwell in Manhattan Bridge Park? Listen, you guys take off without me. Maybe I can distract security. I am a magician, after all. - What? - We got to get him to the truck. Uh, no, no, no, they'll grab him. We're not taking the truck. - Hey, stop. - Turn on the camera. Come on, jump! Whoa! Oh, come on! Get my car! Let's go! Head to the park. I'll meet you there. We need backup, now! Go, Clifford! Come on, boy! Hey. What are you doing? You like magic? - Watch me disappear! - Hey! Get back! - We're here at Lyfegro... - Can I borrow this? - Hey! - That dog was stolen by Lyfegro. Oh, no! Look out! Come on! Go! It looks like the big red dog has escaped the Lyfegro facility in the strangest chase I have ever seen. Whoa! Easy! Come on, come on! Yeah! I see red. Turn! No, no, no, no, no! Come on! Go, go! He belongs to my niece, Emily. She rescued him when he was just a tiny puppy. If her mom is watching, I'd like it on record that I told her not to. - Casey? - But she didn't listen. Because she knew, right from the beginning, that that dog was her dog. And now, a big corporation is trying to steal a puppy from a little girl. Are we gonna do anything about it? And finally, to my ninth-grade math teacher, Mr. Beamus, who told me that I would never amount to anything, I would like to point out that only one of us is on TV right now. So, Mr. Beamus, you can kiss my... Oh, snap. Sir, where is that dog going? Manhattan Bridge Park. Can we go faster? - Over here. - I'm gonna need a ride. Look! That dog right there! At the end of the tunnel, the park should be really close. - Just step on it. - I'm stepping! I'm stepping! - Guys! Emily! She's on TV! - What? Careful! Two hands on the wheel! - Everybody calm down! - Okay, okay, okay! Watch out! Sarge, big red dog heading north! - Yes! - We have police security vehicles all chasing after a young girl riding a giant red dog. They're back! Come on, boy, faster! I mean, this is crazy! Doesn't she understand she can't win? Come on. Oh, no! Whoa! Come on, jump! Whoa! Hey, hey! - Oh, perfect. - Wow. - Yes! We made it! - Look at that dog! Look at the dog. Mr. Bridwell! Mr. Bridwell! My goodness! Someone's been eating their spinach. You are hot! You need a drink. Go over there to that big blue dunk tank over there. - Mr. Bridwell! - Emily! We were looking for you, and we thought you were dead. Well, I hope not. I just booked a safari. But at the hospital, we saw your bow tie. Oh, I understand. Well, I went there to spend time with an old friend. A very sick old friend. And he'd always loved that bow tie, so I gave it to him so that he could stand out from the crowd up there. Mr. Bridwell, you have to make Clifford small again or they're gonna hurt him. Small? But it was your love that made him so big. Nobody can take that away. But will he be okay? Your love is all he needs. Create a perimeter! Do not let that dog leave this park. Emily Elizabeth Howard, for your own safety, please step away from the animal. - He's dangerous. - He's just a puppy! That creature is the property of Lyfegro and is a threat to our city! No, he's not! He never hurt anyone, I swear. Lock him in a cage. Whoa, you see that? He's violent! No, he's just scared. You would be, too. Please, leave him alone. Mr. Bridwell, you've got to do something. I can't do this on my own. They're not listening! Really? Well, why have they come? Back off, back off. And you thought you didn't have any friends, huh? All right, ladies and gentlemen, disperse immediately. Let's go, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go, let's go, let's go! See what happens when people break the rules? Emily, if you want them to listen, you'd better speak. Hmm? - Let's go get that dog. - No, please, stop! No, I have something I have to say. There's a lot of people here. You got this. My name is Emily Elizabeth, and this is my dog, Clifford. I know he's bigger than most dogs, but he's also the kindest, most loving dog in the whole wide world. He's a freak! - It's dangerous! - No, he's not dangerous! He's just different. That's all. I know how he feels, because I know what it's like to not fit in. Just because you're different, it doesn't mean that it's okay to be teased or bullied. And I'm gonna guess that many of you know how much that hurts. Emily Elizabeth! Someone once told me it's the people who are unique, they're the ones who change the world. If Clifford was just a regular dog, we wouldn't all be here. We've got to stand up for him! - Emily's right! - Yeah, that's right! That dog saved my life! He doesn't hurt anyone. He just... He loves. Yeah! And if we can love each other like this, none of us would have to feel small and all alone again. Right, Clifford? It's not right to take him away just because he's big and red. So, please. Please let me keep my dog. Who's with me? Oh! Oh! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! That was so inspiring, Emily. I've got chills. Oh, my goodness. Man, I hate to ruin this beautiful moment, but I've got to reclaim my property. Because we all know this dog you call Clifford - belongs to... - Lyfegro. No, he doesn't. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Please do not take my word for it. You see, he was microchipped at birth. Yeah. Officer, could you please do the honors? - Go home! - He converted her property! - It's in his left neck. - That's right, left neck. Oh, my gosh, this is glorious. Excuse me, young lady. Isn't this fun? - This dog belongs to... - Yeah. ...Emily Elizabeth Howard. What? That's impossible. - Good for you, Emily! - That's bonkers! This is a mistake. Nah-ah. It's a mistake! It's got to be a mistake. We need to have a talk about the bill the city will be sending you. Please escort this gentleman to my vehicle. Get your hands off me. Come on. Colette, where's my attorney? - I quit. - What? Colette! I'll never leave you, sir. I don't care about you. Colette! - Ouch. - Colette, come back here. Isn't technology amazing? People say it's quite like magic. So, if you'll excuse me, I have some other people I need to help. After all, you're not the only person in the world who isn't looking for a pet. Officers! Stand down! Make way! - Come here, Clifford! - Way to go! Come, come. - Hey, girl. - Mom! My bold and brave little girl. Just like you taught me. Oh, by the way, Mom... we got a dog. Yeah, I noticed. As for you, I have no words to... "I love you. I forgive you. You are the responsible brother that I always dreamed of having." Okay, we'll go with that for now. Well, you did it, Em. You saved him, just like you said you would. Well, I couldn't have done it without my mature and super-dependable uncle. You have another uncle? You know how you said no one believes in you? I believe in you. You just need to believe in yourself. - How do you know so much stuff for a fourth grader? - Sixth. I was doing air quotes behind your back. Okay. We love you, too, Clifford. Guys! Let's take a picture of Clifford. A group photo. Everybody scooch in. Get in, get in. Uh, Casey, you know what? Casey, just get on the dog. - No. No! - Yeah, yeah, that'd be neat. - Get on the dog, it's fun! - I'm not getting on the dog. If you don't get on the dog, I'll tell Mom about... Okay, let's get on the dog. - There he goes. - Yeah, get up there. Come on, Casey. Get up there. There you go. All right. That's perfect. Perfect. Oh, no. - Clifford. No fetch. - Oh, no. - No fetch! - No. Clifford! And so the pure, simple love between a girl and her dog changed everything. Emily and her mother were welcomed home, and Packard even acquired a uniquely helpful assistant. Other people matured. And by "other people", I mean Uncle Casey, who finally moved out of his van and got a proper job. And so, a story that began with two lost souls ends with one big family: A little girl, a giant red dog, and a city that came together because of them.
