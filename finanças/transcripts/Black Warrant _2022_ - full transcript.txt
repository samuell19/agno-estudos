[sirens wailing] [car horn honks] [sirens continue wailing] [sirens continue wailing] [horn honks] [horn honks] [groans] You're gonna miss this, Juanito. I know. I am having lots of second thoughts. Nah, you're doing the right thing though. [sighs] I hope so. Of course you are, man. [Juan] I know, but working at a desk? I mean... So you guys pick out a name yet, or-- You're wasting your time. It's not gonna be Tony. Come on, man. I mean, Tony, that is a good-ass name. I mean, not only you got-- you got Uncle Tony here, you also got, um, Sir Anthony Hopkins. Hannibal Lecter? Shit, yeah. Yeah, I don't think so. Well, I mean, you know he's not actually Hannibal, though, right? I mean, ask anyone. Say, "Hey, y'all know Anthony Hopkins?" And it'll be like, "Oh, the dude who eats people?" Shit. [Anthony] All right. Well, what about, uh, Marc Antony? Idiot. Divorced JLo. Bad move. I meant the other-- the other Marc Antony. He killed himself, didn't he? Oh, fuck it. What's it gonna be? Juan Jose Ortado Moreno III. Fuckin' hell, man. [Juan laughs] No, it's Juan Junior. Geez, that's such a lack of imagination. It's my name, man, and my dad's name. Yeah, but how many Juans do we need in the world, right? Just Juan. And Juan Two and Juan Three? [laughs] [siren blares] [Juan] Man, I can't believe we have this cavalry behind for such a small-time bust. It's over the top, if you ask me. These guys are small-timers. Gotta take out the small-timers before they become big-timers, right? Right. [horn blaring] [siren blaring] [in Spanish] We're here, guys. Everyone stay vigilant. [tires squealing] [indistinct shouting] [officers shout in Spanish] Now, you sit and stay here, all right? Fuck you. [door closes] Be right back. Hey, don't say that. It's bad luck. I still need you to pay for the baptism. Yeah, are we done here? People got responsibilities, important jobs to do. Just leave it to the pros. Yeah, get the fuck outta here. [chuckles] [officer speaks Spanish] [Anthony, in Spanish] Bring the dogs. [officers speaking Spanish] [in English] Let's go, let's go, let's go. [officer] Ándele! Rápido, rápido! [officers clamoring] Policía! Ándele! [in Spanish] Attention. This is the DEA... Ándele! Ándele! [officers clamoring] ...and the police. Stop what you are doing and put your hands on your head. [shouts in Spanish] [radio chatter] Rápido. Aquí. [speaking Spanish] [K-9 whines] [K-9 officer continues in Spanish] [officers speaking Spanish] [paper crinkling] [yelling in the distance] [loud whirring] Patricia, ándele. [paper shredder whirring] It's all right. [speaks Spanish] No, Fernando's not here yet. Patricia, ándele! [in Spanish] On the floor. Oh! [in Spanish] Don't shoot, señor. Is there anyone else in this office? No, no, no. It's just me. [toilet flushing] What's up, Zico? You're confused. I'm Ramon. Stop shitting me. I know who you are. If anyone knows you, it's me. [in English] Get up. Let's go. [in Spanish] Did you escape or did they let you out of jail? [phone ringing] [beeps] Is everything okay? Your mom's gonna say no either way. [Patricia screams] [Patricia screams] [in English] Cover me. [whispers] Fucker. Heads up in the alley! Well, I like the two-bedroom. Why don't we get that one? Okay. [Zico grunts] Freeze! Drop your weapon! [Zico] Shit! [officers shouting in Spanish] [Carmen on phone] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Juan! No, no, no! Oh, my God! No, no, no! No fuckin' way. Oh, my God! I need some help! [officer speaking Spanish] Oh, my God! Come on, man! Just don't! [Carmen screaming] Don't you fuckin' do this to me! Come on, man! No! Fuck! [police radio beeping] [in Spanish] Officer down! Fuck, man! I need some help! Man down! I need-- [groans] Come on, man! Fuck, man! Jesus Christ! [sobbing] I'm so sorry, man! [sirens wailing] [Carmen] Juan! [siren echoing] [operatic music playing] [footsteps approaching] Oh, my God! I don't believe it. Hey, Nick! [laughs] How the hell did you find me? It wasn't easy, but then again, it wasn't that difficult. Permission to come aboard, sir? Permission granted. Yeah, thank you. Care for a libation? Always! [grunts] Whoo! So this is what retirement in Mexico looks like. Yeah, it's my house, I guess. I'm trying to remember. Was that with water, or... [groans] Just a little ice in there, that's fine. All right. Yeah. [chuckles] I could get used to this very easily. Here you go. Oh, salut. Salut. [chuckles] It's, uh, good to see you, Nick. Yeah. This isn't a social visit, Nick. I have three black warrants I need you to execute. Maybe you didn't get the hints because of my formal attire, but I am retired. Your country needs you. Oh, Francis. You don't get it, do you? I mean, do you know what my day is like? And I'd say pretty much every day. I get up in the morning, I take a pee, then I eat breakfast, take a shit, possibly go into town. The afternoon, I like to grab a little siesta. And then at the end of the day, a cocktail, just like the one I'm enjoying right now. And that's the way you'd like to spend the rest of your days? Well, I wouldn't mind getting laid a little bit more often, but, yeah, that's pretty much it. We have a mole in the agency. Oh. By the time we clear everybody, it'll be too late. That's why we need you, and we need you now. I got $600,000 in this bag. That's $200,000 a warrant. Imminent danger. We've got three, four days tops. [sighs] Let me get my readers. [grunts] [chuckles] You must really be retired. Yes, I am. You folks must really be up against the wall. We are. Yeah, that's nice. Bin-Farri? My God, that was 25 years ago. What is this? Well, you know, after everything went down in Miami the way it did, he was untouchable. Too high profile. We couldn't go after him again. Well, he's reappeared on the radar with something very bad. [grunts] Nick, before you say anything, I gotta let you know, if you say no, well, there's a good chance that you might be exposed about Miami. You son of a bitch! Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's not me. You know I wouldn't do something like that. It's those guys. They can't take a chance on you saying no. That's why they sent me. They know we're friends. Oh, some friend you are. You've got a lot of balls sayin' that. Huh? After everything I did for your son? The son you abandoned? If that doesn't prove our friendship, I don't know what does. What the hell kinda thing is that to say to me? That's not what I'm saying! Okay, yeah. Well, don't think I'm enjoying being here, layin' all this shit on ya. Nick, I wouldn't be here if this wasn't a situation of national security. [Nick] And who's the other guy? [Larusso] Oh, that's Polat, the Turk. You take him out, and, well, Bin-Farri's whole money laundering scheme goes to hell. And this guy's some character. He has a large appetite for 12-year-old girls. Twelve-year-old girls turned prostitutes by Bin-Farri and his people. Jesus. [sighs] This one? That's Mustafar. He introduced Bin-Farri to a number of terrorist organizations. We have confirmation that they have a cargo shipment comin' in to Mexico. We believe it's biological weapons. Yeah. This is serious. Well... Come on, buddy. You can do this. It'll be like old times. And I'll tell you what. If they ask you to do anything after this, I promise you I'll tell 'em to go fuck themselves. Oh. I will. And I'll quit. Ho-ho! I will! I'll quit, and I'll come and, well, I'll live with you on this floating mansion. I'll be your first mate. What do you say? Frankie, if you do that, remember this. Out at sea, I am in command. Aye-aye, Captain. [chuckles] [phone ringing] Hey, man. I would encourage you to ask for a permanent transfer to another field office. I'm good. You sure? Okay. What do you got for me? So, San Mar was bought five months ago. They import chandeliers from China and all their parts. They assemble them, then wholesale them to distributors all around the country. Papers are straight. They're clean as a whistle. The shooter? Confirmed to be Zacarias Zapata, aka Zico. He was locked up in El Hongo last I heard, but somebody must have paid lots of money to get him out. Come on, are you telling me there are no bad apples in that entire barrel? Come on. No one seems to know who Zico is. They're probably lying, but I would if I was them too, you know? Here you go. Thank you. What is that? Polat. Polat? Yeah. Who the hell's Polat? [groans] The manager. He's the only non-Mexican there. I don't know. Somethin' just rubbed me the wrong way about him, so I ran his prints. I was about to come find you. Come here. I know. I heard it. What do you mean? I was on the phone with him. Jesus. I heard everything. [cries] I'm so sorry. [sobbing] Two fucking hours! [speaking Spanish] What? I've been waiting for two hours to take a piss. Sorry, it's been busy here. I didn't shoot anyone. I don't know who that guy was. I never saw that person in my entire life. Just shut the fuck up. Yeah? Jesus. So, what do you do for San Mar? I manage the shipping and receiving. Uh, you wanna try that again? Polat? Polat. Who is that? FBI, Interpol, Europol, Turkish intelligence. Shit, man, you got warrants out from all of them! How long you been on the run, hmm? It's been a while. Money laundering though, that's... It's good business. Until someone gets pissed off, or you get caught, like this. I get it. I'm in shit! Okay? Listen. This is going to be like Christmas for you. Okay? I'm going to give you exactly who you really want. Oh, yeah? And who do we really want? You make me a deal... [chuckles softly] ...and I will give you Hussein Bin-Farri. Now, who the fuck is that? You don't know Hussein Bin-Farri? No. No, we don't know. Are you fucking with me? Do you live in a cave? There is a Rashida Bin-Farri at the new cultural center. Nice woman. No, no, no, no, that's the niece. She is... Never mind. This guy, he's a terrorist, okay? Okay, what the fuck is this guy talking about? Hey, gringo! You've heard of Bin Laden, yeah? Yeah. You think Bin Laden was a terrorist? [Anthony] Yeah. This guy says to Bin Laden, "Hey, Osama, get the fuck out of my way!" Okay. So, señor, if I was you, I would pay careful attention to everything I have to say. But first, we talk deal. Then I give you everything about the operation. What operation? You fucking people! I will give you a very small hint, okay? Unless you do something to stop him, Bin-Farri is going to level the United States economy. And then any country that has extra cash laying around, hmm? Are you talking about a bomb? Better. They have some fancy-schmancy machine. It was unloading when you guys made your freaky scene. You talkin' about that van outside? No, no, no. Those guys, they were just unloadin' somethin'. They were all clean. They were unloading a chandelier or some shit. A chandelier, huh? Yeah. Can a chandelier turn off a whole country? Because this one does! What are you talking about? Turn off a country? No more until you make me a deal. As example of good faith negotiation, I will give you all the goods on Bin-Farri's shell companies where he launders his money. I just need access to my laptop. This guy sounds like a snake, just willing to give up his boss. Yeah, well, under these circumstances, I'm entitled to go through a selfish phase, no? I need some water. You want some water? Yeah. I still need to piss. But, sure, okay. I'll take some water, but it has to be sparkling water. Perrier, Pellegrino, something like that. I'll send someone to take you to piss. [Turco] I don't trust the water here. [lock clicks] [camera whirring] So, Agent Vanowen... [Turco on monitor] Fuck, I gotta take a piss! Come on! What do you think? I mean, shit. Gotta call the FBI. [Turco] Hey, you guys! You may wanna let the FBI know about this, huh? This shit is going to blow their minds! They'll give me a better deal, huh? Hello? Hello? I swear. Also, when you extradite me, and I'm sure you're going to want to extradite me, I want a nice suite in a flashy boutique hotel. All right. I'll call the FBI. Yeah. Okay? Tell them I want a total immunity agreement approved by my attorney. He's in Texas. I'll give you the number. Are you there? I have to piss! Yeah, go fuck yourself. [seagulls squawking] [opera playing on speakers] [in Spanish] Leave it, please. I'll do it. He was my partner. [in Spanish] I'm sorry for your loss. [phone ringing] [clears throat] Vanowen. Yes, sir. [phone ringing] Nick. Roger that. Oh. You got a room number? [children chattering] [Nick, in Spanish] Hey, señor. [in Spanish] Yes, señor. Do you have coconut water? Of course, señor. I have fresh coconut. If you're hungover, I can offer you a "coco loco." What is a "coco loco"? It's cream of coconut with tequila and vodka. [scoffs] [in English] All before noon? Muy bien. [in Spanish] Okay, give me a "coco loco." Only one. But don't let them catch you. The cops will screw me over. [in English] No, we don't want la tira. No, no, no, no. [children chattering in distance] Ready, señor. How much is it? 150, but if you'd like to leave a tip... [in English] Let's make it an even 200. [in Spanish] Including the tip. Thank you. You're welcome, boss. [Captain mumbles] Gracias. [Anthony] Hey! Hey, what's up? So the Turk wasn't lying. FBI got their panties in a bunch. I gotta take him to the border. When? Right now. Well, he's technically not been detained, so basically, you're taking him for a car ride. Yeah, the FBI, they'll pick him up there. Okay, I'll get you an escort. No, no, no, I'm good. No, you should really take an escort to get him across the border. I don't wanna draw any more attention than I have to. Okay then. [elevator bell dings] [Turco] Hey, chica. Any chance they could send us another girl to work on my legs while you-- [groans] I may not get one of these for a while, huh? [groans] Maybe afterwards, we can have ourselves a little Turkish/Mexican ménage à trois? [cracking] [groans] What say you, darling? [Turco grunts] [knocking] [moans] Yeah. [scoffs] It's time to go, Polat. No! What? Come on! We gotta go. Why? She hasn't even done my legs yet. [Anthony] I don't care. Where is my lawyer? He's gonna meet you on US soil, okay? But we gotta leave this hotel now, so-- I'm supposed to have two more days here, man. The party is over, dickhead. Pack up your shit. Okay, okay! Every party has a pooper. [elevator bell dings] Why you in a shit mood all the time, huh? Life is good, man. You get ulcers. How 'bout you and I make a deal? How 'bout you drive me to the airport instead, and I give you the password for my laptop, okay? I give you the password, and I will give you the location of the man who shot your friend. Come on. You will have all of Bin-Farri's assets. You will get his friends in the scene. You will get Bin-Farri. Tell them I had a gun on you. We can make it work. Come on, man. I will deposit $5 million for you in any account in the world. One hundred percent untraceable. I can do it from your cell phone. Give half the money to the widow, if you want. I don't care. [dispatcher speaking Spanish on radio] I'll make it ten million, but we have to act now! Come on, man. [elevator bell dings] Let's go. Please, no-- Come on, man! Fuckin' hell, man. Hey, señor, watch it! Be careful! That's a $3,000 case, man! Not a fucking laundry basket! Get in the fucking car! [hotel guests screaming] Fuck! [hotel guests clamoring] [officer] Across the street, on the roof. [dispatcher chattering on radio] [bell dings] [groans] No! Another fucking fence! [grunts] [sirens wailing in distance] [tires screeching] [Captain, in Spanish] What the fuck happened here? Someone in this group said where Turco was. And when I find out who it was, may God protect the son of a bitch that did it because he won't forget me. Now get the hell out of here! I don't want to see any of you! Vanowen. So his cell phone data shows that he was at Vista Parallax, which is a high-end looking place. He was there at least six times this month. So we set up a stakeout across the street. And since your witness literally lost his mind, I thought you might want to stay occupied and fill in a hole in the rotation. We have eyes on the place. Okay, I'll give 'em a call. I already did, and it got approved. Just as a reinforcement. This is not a DEA operation, okay? Just watch the place. And it wasn't your fault, Vanowen. Live and learn. Next time, you take an escort with you. [stakeout officer 1, in Spanish] I still don't get what you are doing. [stakeout officer 2] I told you, I'm putting all my Barcelona FC stuff on eBay. [stakeout officer 1] I thought Barcelona was the best team in the world. [stakeout officer 2] Yeah, but Messi is gone. [stakeout officer 1] So? Now you only gonna buy PSG shit? You bet your ass. And what if Messi later goes to another team? Then I'll buy stuff from that team. But Messi is not a team. You can't just cheer him. You need a team. And how the fuck does this bother you or affect you in any way? Why don't you worry about getting your Cruz Azul some fucking aim? That team is a big dud. [in Spanish] Kids, get to work. Do we have ears on the inside? No, we could only get the video, but don't have the audio. What are we looking for? Suspicious people. Well, that's going to be super easy because a lot of really suspicious people go in there. [in English] I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some audio. [in Spanish] Who the fuck is Claudio? Who knows? Hello. Hello. [in Spanish] How many in your group? [in English] Just one. Of course. This way, please. [patrons chattering] Uh, how do I get over here? That's the VIP section. Ah. How do I become a VIP? VIPs don't need to tell anyone they're VIPs. [laughs] Okay. I'll be back to take your order. [in Spanish] Look at the massive balls on this bastard. [speaks Spanish] [laughs] [equipment whirring] [chef, in Spanish] I'll be right back. I'm going to the market. [cash register dings] [clerk speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [up-tempo Latin music plays on speakers] [in Spanish] If you take a picture, it'll last you longer. Sorry? Shit! Damn it. Do I know you? No, you don't. Ah, I'm pretty sure I've seen you before. I'm sure you have. No, the Parallax, right? How do you know? I've been there a few times. Seen you around. I'm usually in the kitchen. Oh, Anthony. I still don't remember you. Ah, can we talk? Listen, I'm not used to speed dating at the market. No, no, I'm not trying to hit on you. I was just hoping we could talk in private, so I don't get you into trouble. Por favor? Come on. I have nothing to do with the business or anything that goes on there. I just make food. [Anthony] No, I know. I know. So what do you want from me? What's your name? Mina. Mina. Mina. That's nice. I got a big favor to ask from you. From me? Yeah, I need you to place this underneath the VIP table at the Parallax. [scoffs] No! Why? It's for an investigation the DEA's running. Are they selling drugs in there? Fuck! Maybe. Are you gonna be shutting down the Parallax? Why? So I can start looking for another job. No, no, no, I-- [chuckles] Gosh. I don't know, okay? But I doubt the people involved have anything to do with the actual business, okay? But there's only one way to find out. I mean, no one would ever know it was you. There's lots of cameras. Stick it under the table. That's all. What's in it for me? Come on! [laughs] This'll take you, like, ten seconds. I don't know. That expression on your face tells me this is a buyer's market. Am I the buyer or the seller? You are the seller. [chuckles] Okay. How about this? I do this thing for you, and then we get married, so I can get a green card, so I can join the CIA. You wanna join the CIA? The Culinary Institute of America. It's in New York. Best cooking school in the US. Wow. Okay. Let me think about that. Did not plan on getting married anytime soon. I'm just kidding. You're not even my type. Ouch! Gotta go to work now. [Mina sighs] I'll do it, but you will owe me one. Of course. Don't tell anyone. If I get fired, it's gonna be your fault. Fair enough. You know, when you were talking to me back at the market, before I knew you were a law man, I actually thought it was my lucky day. [Anthony] All right. Here she goes. [in Spanish] There's no audio, but there's video. [typing] [stakeout officer 1, in English] Hell yeah! [in Spanish] Look at you, having her eating out of your hand. What did you tell her? Mmm. I think he proposed and offered her a green card. Hell yeah! Check the sound. Hmm? [orchestral music plays on headphones] [vehicle doors closing] [alarm chirps] [laughing] [siren wailing in distance] [static on radio] [chattering on surveillance equipment] [stakeout officer 1, in Spanish] See them. They're on the patio. [in English] Hey, let me get that. Señor Bin-Farri. [Bin-Farri] How are you doing, my friend? Good, how are you? Good. Welcome to Tijuana. Thank you. [Bin-Farri on headphones] Do you enjoy hookahs? [Yuri] Thank you, but I prefer to work first. [Bin-Farri] Everything okay? [Yuri] That's why you're here. [Bin-Farri] So tell me, Fernando, how come you cost me so much money after I pay for everything else? Let me see it. Where is it? [Yuri] Do you have payment? [Bin-Farri] Half, as agreed, now, the rest after it's installed. So want a hit? The machine's hardwired to a local cellular network. [static] No, no, no, no! Where the fuck are they goin'? Watch out there. [cell phone chiming] [electricity powering down] [horns honking] [speaking Spanish] [device beeping] What the hell is that, guys? [speaking Spanish] Come on! [horns honking] [cell phone chiming] [electricity powering up] All right. I saw it, but I can't believe it. It's all here. [in Arabic] This is exactly what we wanted. Easier than takeout. Please, try it yourself. [cell phone chiming] Motherfucker! Come on! [speaking Spanish] [speaking Spanish] It's just like changing a TV channel. [speaking Spanish] But next time, it could be the entire power grid on the east side of the United States. So we're done here then? Congratulations. Are we still on for tomorrow? Of course. Let's eat then. [bodyguard grunts] Who's there? [clamoring] Don't let him shoot! Yeah, follow me! Let's go! [grunts] Move it. Go, go, go! DEA, freeze! [tires squealing] DEA, drop the weapon! Drop it. [flash-bang clattering, exploding] [groans] Fuck! [steam hissing] [siren wailing in distance] [Italian opera plays on car radio] [camera shutter clicks] [officer speaking Spanish] [dispatcher speaking on police radio] [officer speaking Spanish] [police radio chatter] [officer speaking Spanish] What happened? Yeah, you shouldn't be here. What did you do? Me? Nothin'. Is this because of the-- No, no, no, no. Definitely not. [police radio chatter] Was he actually here? [sighs] Yeah, yeah. No, someone knew he'd be here, so. Right under our fucking noses? Yep. [Captain] Well... So that's Zico for sure. Yeah. And the other guy there was Bin-Farri. These guys are like bodyguards, and who the fuck is the cowboy? The other ones, I don't know who they are. Yeah, we lost power a few times. Yeah, the whole city went dark twice last night without no reason. Wait, wait, the entire city? [Captain] Entire city. All right, you know what? The camera had a battery. I bet it recorded everything. [Captain] Fuck off. It was them. Holy shit! Oh, this can't be good. No, I mean, if you think that's bad, I bet... Shit, man, I bet that was just a rehearsal. Fuck! Yeah. [people chattering in Spanish] [workers chatting in Spanish] [Yuri] Okay, here it is. Where do you want it? [speaking Spanish] I have something to show you. I will transfer the money right away. I need the money you already owed me. What money? Your guys showed me the money, then I demonstrated the system to you. Suddenly, I was being shot at. It seems that the money is missing. But don't worry. We will make it up to you. Look, I just want my money, and I'm out of here, okay? Please follow me. [in Spanish] Please take the truck. Khahil was going to do the work here. Now you must do it. Me? No. No fucking way! I made what you wanted, I am delivering what you wanted, and I showed you that it works. I did my job, and I need to be paid now. What can I offer you to change your mind? I watched my cousin get killed because of you. I'll give you three times what we agreed. $30 million? As long as you give me your word that you will stay until the job is done. I'll do it right now. Fifty million. Fifty? Before you fuck up the global economy, I'd like to have some security. How long will it take? A day or two, plus whatever the code takes to propagate all over the Internet. Okay. Okay. [up-tempo electronic dance music plays] [guests chattering] [chattering] Stunning. Thank you so much for... You making it here is completely-- Hi. Anthony Vanowen. Rashida Bin-Farri. It's a pleasure to meet you. Is there somewhere we could speak in private? About what? Hussein Bin-Farri. My uncle? Why don't you talk to him yourself? Actually, I'd rather speak with you. Excuse me. Are you police? DEA. DEA. Do you think my uncle, who's funded most of this institution, is somehow involved in illegal narcotics? No, no, no, it's not about that. Good evening, sir. Hi. Hope you're enjoying yourself. Absolutely. Mmm. Mina, my darling, would you make sure everyone has champagne by the end of my speech? Of course. Excuse me. [Rashida] Excuse me. I have to go. Is there any way... It's very important that we speak. I have to go. Call my office. [guests applauding] [in Spanish] Thank you, thank you. After five long years of work, planning and dreams, I am pleased that you are here in the Bismallah Cultural Center Tijuana. Of course, none of this would be possible without the financial support of our most generous donor, Mr. Hussein Bin-Farri. Where is my uncle? [whirring] [Rashida speaking Spanish on surveillance footage] [in Arabic] I should be out there. They are looking all over for me. [in Arabic] Someone else is looking for you. [in English] Sure. [Rashida speaking Spanish on surveillance footage] [in English] That's the same guy who tried to stop us outside the Parallax. [Rashida, in English] ...our guest of honor for the night, Laila Sayed. The shooter? Has to have been. No. I've seen him before. He's DEA. He was outside the San Mar warehouse. Did you know the DEA had a history with San Mar before we bought it? No. [Rashida] ...for her humanitarian efforts... So you didn't know that the San Mar brothers smuggled drugs? No. Then why is the DEA up my ass? [Rashida] Ladies and gentlemen, help me welcome Laila Sayed. Go do something about it. Make sure it's him. [guests applauding on surveillance footage] That's the guy. I know it's him. [up-tempo electronic dance music plays] [camera shutter clicking] Shit! [Mina] Gracias. Are you gonna follow me again? What are you doin' out here? I'm done for the night. You happen to see an old guy come out here, like, seconds ago? You mean the guy in the jeep? [Anthony] Old guy? That was him right now. He just left. Shit! Is this you? Mm-hmm. All right, get in. We're gonna follow him. [car engine revving] [tires squealing] Did you catch him smoking weed in the bathroom or something? What? No, no. [Mina] Why are we following him? [opera playing on speakers] Come on! Look, look. [stammers] You're gonna lose him. You wanted me to follow him, I'm following him. [Anthony] You should turn the lights off. You're getting a little too pushy, okay? I don't like that. Look, I'm sorry. I just-- I cannot lose him. [Mina] Happy? I can't see anything. [Anthony] Your eyes will adjust. [Mina] By the time my eyes adjust, we're gonna be wrapped around a pole. [Anthony] Wow. [Mina] Oh. [Mina] So now what? What did he do? Um... okay. I mean, I guess I could tell you. [chuckles] I think that guy-- Uh, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, no. I don't wanna know. [chuckles] I just changed my mind, just like right now. Don't tell me anything. Don't you tell me anything, because I don't wanna have to testify about anything. Never mind. I'm sorry if any of this scared you, or... Scared me? What is wrong with you? Nothing. It's just the way you're lookin' at me right now is making me think, I don't know, maybe... [up-tempo Latin music plays on car radio] So what's next? I'll help. Even if it's just another little job like the microphone, that was fun. Another job? Another bug? Secret camera? In Breaking Bad, he puts a GPS thingy by the tire. I can do that. Do you want me to put one of those thingies on the jeep's tire? No, no. I don't want you to put any thingy anywhere. I just fucking tailed someone! This is so cool. So, technically speaking, what am I? A DEA, a CI, an informant? [chuckles] Listen, Mina. Um, you did me a huge favor, and then you did me another favor, and I appreciate that, and I owe you one, but there are no more jobs. [chuckling] Fine! So, now what? Take you back? How 'bout a drink? I know the perfect place. [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [Anthony] What's that? Do you care? No, I don't care. [mellow Latin music plays on radio] So what's your story? My story? Where did you grow up? Fort Wayne, Indiana. Raised by my grandparents. How come? Uh, my mom died when I was a kid. My dad, he took me to live with them. Sorry. It was a long time ago. So your dad just left you there? Yeah. [sighs] You don't abandon your kid. You just don't. When did you learn to speak English? This is Tijuana. Learn or starve. Your Spanish is not bad. A little chunky. Chunky. But cute. Thought I wasn't your type. You're not. [mellow Latin music plays] This is me. Thank you. [car alarm chirps] [tires squealing] [ship horn blows in distance] [engine starts] [police siren chirps] Morning, sir. Mornin'. Driver's license, please. You're a little out of your jurisdiction, aren't ya, son? Here you go. Where you goin'? Oh, over to the mercado, get some groceries. Did I do something wrong? I'm not a traffic cop. DEA. Special Agent Anthony Vanowen. Hi, Dad. [Nick] Have a seat. Can I get you somethin'? [Anthony] Yeah, I'll take a beer, if you have any. Got that. Here you go. [bottle cap clatters] What? I don't know, I'm... I'm just lookin' at ya, and you... You're a man. You've grown up. You look so different. [exhales] Like, how many years has it been? Jesus! I guess I owe you an explanation. [chuckles] You think so, do you? You remember when you and I drove from Cincinnati up to Chicago to see the Cubs? The day my mom died? Yeah, I remember that. And that man that killed your mom... was, in fact, trying to kill me. Wait. [chuckles] No. Wait. [stammers] Why would anyone wanna kill you? The year before, I filled his hotel room with carbon monoxide, and it killed his wife, his son, his daughter and his father. Everyone. And he wasn't even there. He was supposed to be, but he wasn't even there. And you told me you were... What was it? An industrial lubricant salesman, right? You traveled across the world all the time. No, my job was with a shadow agency of the NSA, and it was my job to execute black warrants and kill enemies of the state. You just kill people for a living, that's all. You know, when you put it like that, it doesn't sound so good, but it was my job. It's not great. I decided it was time to let you go. I knew one day you'd move on. You'd get married and have kids of your own. I would never get to meet them, and that was painful for me. [exhales] I got a lot of regrets. The one regret that I never allowed myself to have was the decision to protect you. Yeah, okay. Tony? I will be here if you wanna talk. Yeah, sure. Yeah. [footsteps departing] [Nick clears throat] Tony? Tony, Tony? Take this. If you need to talk, just call me. Dial direct, one. Yeah, I'll call you. Please. Hey! [Anthony groans, grunts] [Zico speaking Spanish] [grunting] No! [grunts] [Zico speaking Spanish] [Anthony grunts] [speaking Spanish] [groans] [tires squealing] [engine revving] [grunts] [insects chirping] [machine beeping, whirring] [typing] How much longer? I'd say about 24 hours. Okay. [machine continues whirring] [Bin-Farri laughs] Must be cheating on someone. Two phones. I know. Let me ask you, Agent Vanowen. Have we met before? Then what is it? What is it that I did to piss you off? Why are you in my life? How the fuck should I know who you are, huh? You were at my warehouse, messing around. Then the other night, you tried to stop my vehicle after somebody tried to assassinate me! What am I to think? I don't know. Why don't you ask your trigger-happy friend here? He's the one that killed my partner. Yeah, I see you. [Anthony groans] What happened to Polat? What happened? He put a bullet in his head! That's not true. I was there. What did Polat tell you? What is it that you want, huh? Uh-oh. Yeah, I learned that from-- [grunts] [laughs] Wait. Does that not mean pepperoni pizza? [groans] [grunts] Know what? Now, I just wanna kill you. [groans] [Anthony pants heavily] Hey, what? [muffled shouting] [liquid sloshing] [gasping] [Yuri] What is going on? [pants heavily] Fuck you! [phone ringing] They could be tracking him. [phone continues ringing] [Anthony groans] Hello? It's for you. [Nick on phone] Bin-Farri? Who is this? [Nick] Someone who knows you very well. It's been over 20 years since Miami. It's you. It all makes sense now. You used this DEA agent as bait to find me. Clever. Why weren't you in Miami? Your family was there, but no, you were in some hotel with your mistress. We all have regrets. How did you find out about my son? Son? Anthony. Who else? Anthony Vanowen is your son? [Nick] Let him go. That's not going to happen. [cell phone beeps] What, big man? You can't kill a DEA agent. Everyone can be killed. Bring it. What? [door creaks open] [in Spanish] Do you have a lot left to talk about here? [in Spanish] In an hour, go make another round. An hour? I have to finish here. Don't you see we're very busy? Yes, it's awesome. Good afternoon. That door was supposed to be locked! He's the fuckin' janitor. He has keys to everything. It was locked. [electricity powering down] What's this? [Sadiq] I'll check the main power. [gun cocks] Was that you, Fernando? Of course not. [weapon whooshing] [groans, grunts] [gunfire] [speaks Spanish] [bullet clatters] [guard yells in Spanish] [Anthony] Took you long enough. [Nick] Well, I'm here now. [knife clanking] Time to go home, Son. Come on! Vámonos! [tires screeching] [sirens wailing] [officer shouts in Spanish] [Captain speaking Spanish] [officer] Capitán? [police radio chatter] Capitán Escalante. [police radio chatter] [machine beeping, whirring] [in Spanish] What is that, Captain? Is that the Wi-Fi? [Nick chuckles] [groans] That was pretty amazing. Nah. That was you at the Parallax, huh? Pretty sure you almost killed me there. [exhales] You know, I was just thinkin' about that. Yeah. And it's a good thing you told me you were with the DEA, or otherwise, who knows? [scoffs] Jesus! [horns honking in distance] [groans] Oh, shit. Fuck. [grunts] [groans] [Nick exhales] You sleep down below. I'll take up top. Take a shower. It'll probably make you feel better. [groans] Yeah. [chuckles] Thanks. Yeah. You said you were at my high school. Graduation? Yes, I was. Was that just another one of your lies, or what? No, I was there. And you were with your girlfriend. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. And afterwards, the two of you went out and had a pizza. You were still wearing your graduation robes and looked absolutely adorable, if I say so. [scoffs] [Nick chuckles] I was sittin' at the table right next to you. Yeah, that was the last time I saw ya. Hmm. Is that-- Uh. Mm-mmm. Uh, yeah. Yeah. [clears throat] I... [clears throat] After her burial, I moved her out, outta there. Why? I don't know. I just-- I didn't feel right leavin' her behind. And I missed her. Yeah. She's been there all these years. [cell phone buzzing] Excuse me. [groans] Oh, my God. Mina. [chuckles] Hi. I, uh-- I really-- I meant to call, I just... I was kinda tied up. Tony? [in Spanish] Hi, gringo. What's up? Do you know who I am? [stammers] [chuckles] Well, I'll leave you. I'm going to talk to Mina for a while. We'll see what we do. [whimpers] What? Hey. I'm gonna kill that fucker! [Nick] Tony, Tony. Hey! No. Let the cops take care of this one. No, I'm gonna kill that fucker. And then what? And then Bin-Farri. Oh, and then what? You're a DEA agent. All right, fine, fuck it. [Nick] No, no! Listen to me. What? You cross that line, you end up like me. I know what I'm talkin' about. [tires screeching] [gun cocks] Put the gun down or I shoot her. Put the fucking gun down. All right. [gun clatters] And the other one. What now? Sit down. Call him. Your boss? The old guy that got you out. Why? Call him or she's dead. Fuck you. You and I both know you're not gonna shoot her. [gun cocks] I won't? No. This neighborhood at this time? Cops'll be swarmin' this place in minutes. [whimpers] Okay. [Mina screams] [Mina shrieks] Call him or I throw her off! [Mina sobbing] Fine. Now, let her go. [Mina continues sobbing] [cell phone beeping] Hey, Dad, it's me. [Mina screams] [gun clatters] [Anthony grunts] [grunting] [Anthony groaning] [Zico grunts] [Anthony groans] [knife unsheathing] [both groaning] [gun cocks] [both groaning] [gasps] [Nick speaking Spanish] It's okay. Where do I find him? Like I'm gonna fuckin' tell you! [Zico screams] Ow, fuck! [pants heavily] You could've just asked me again! I'm old and I don't have that kind of time! I don't fucking know! All he told me was to get you! And how were you supposed to contact him? Fucking text! And what were you supposed to say in the text? That I'm on my way. Text him! [Zico] All right, all right! [pants heavily] [phone clatters] [Anthony] Give me the phone. Give me the phone. [phone chiming] [Zico] Fuck, fuck. "Kill the agent, make Nick watch, then bring him here. I'll give you the million dollars." Look, he shared his location too. A million dollars? A million dollars. Bin-Farri has a fucking hard-on for you. I don't know what you did, but he wants you fuckin' dead. [Nick] A million dollars. I guess you didn't wanna share that with anyone, so that's why you're here alone. That's pretty industrious of you, Zico. Who fucking cares, all right? I'm fucked! Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe you can help get Bin-Farri to me, and you keep the million. [laughs] The fuck I will. Yeah, fuckin' right. And then we just part ways and never see each other again. Gentleman's agreement. Uh, no. Fuck that! I will kill him before I let him walk away with a million fuckin' dollars! Tony? Are you kiddin' me? [Nick] Bin-Farri's the target. You know you killed my best friend, right? For no fuckin' reason! I don't wanna kill nobody, man! I just don't wanna go to El Hongo, man! [sobbing] I don't wanna go back there. Just fucking kill me now! I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you? Now that kid's gotta grow up without a fucking dad, all because of a piece of shit like you! Then fucking kill me! Gladly! No, no, no, Tony! No, no. [Zico sobbing] No. We need him. We got a deal. Come on, you sorry sack of shit. [screams] Fuck that! [Nick] Get up! Get on your feet. [siren wailing in distance] [Zico pants heavily] [Rashida speaking Arabic] There are 20 patrol cars outside the building. There's a bomb squad. They're trying to dismantle something that looks like a bomb. It doesn't look like a bomb. What is this? Why are you involved? Why am I involved? We will go to Dubai tonight for the time being. You will learn more as I need you to. I'm not going anywhere. You will go where I tell you. No! I live here. And you haven't answered my question. Did you bring a bomb to my building? It's not a bomb. What is it then? I had a personal project! Your personal project was to build a bomb? We're not that family anymore. I needed a place to keep a quantum device. It's not a bomb. That's why we needed to upgrade the power. You used me? You had no problems taking my money. What? You know what? Fuck this. I'm not going anywhere. You agreed to do this. Not this! I'm out! The device is being dismantled as we speak. You haven't paid me! Manuel is dead. It's all over. Your people can't keep a train on tracks. Nothing but incompetent idiots. Fernando, there's no one else. You're the only one who can do it. [Rashida screams] That was enough! [Rashida gasping] [Rashida] What? [gasping] [in Spanish] I need help. [radio static] Open the door. [alarm bleeps] Get him in the back. Copy. He's here. [Zico grunting] [Zico grunts] [Sadiq] As-salaam alaikum. [Zico pants heavily] What the hell is going on? [Zico groans] What is this? What-- [Zico speaking Spanish] [Rashida pants heavily] Fuck. Are we good? Okay. Can we do this now? Things get-- They-- They get a little bit weird. Same account? No. Use this one. [groans] Okay. Yeah? Okay. Wondering what's next? Nah. Judgin' by that character over there, I get the idea. Looks like, uh, you boys started the party early. Let me see him. [sobs softly] [Bin-Farri] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ooh! [guard speaking Spanish] Do something! [Rashida crying] I... I can't. I don't have any bullets. [guard] Okay, okay, okay. Está bien. Está bien. No! Madam? You need to get outta here. Go home. I-I live here. What? Go to the Cultural Center, ask for Captain Escalante. Give him this address. He'll know what to do. Go! [mumbles] Okay, okay. Now you tell me what you want. A million dollars? No. [groaning] You fucking predator. Let's talk about this! No. Okay, gringo. How do I get my money? Get a job. [whispers] What? [sighs] [sirens wailing] [officers speaking Spanish] [dispatcher on radio speaking Spanish] Zico? [muffled shout] [speaking Spanish] [muffled shouting] [speaks Spanish] [Zico grunts] Mmm. [in Spanish] What's up? I heard they miss you in prison. [police radio chatter in Spanish] But first you'll have to talk to the DEA. [radio chatter continues] [Anthony imitates motor revving] Whoa, there's a wave comin'! And then another wave! What are we gonna do, Captain? What are we gonna do? Oh, my God, look at that fog! No, don't cry! No, don't. [fussing] You want everything on it, right? Yes, yes. Here, I'll take that. Oh, my! All right, we'll trade off. Whoo-hoo! [Mina] Do you have a drink? [Anthony] Uh, yeah, I think I do. Thank you. [groans] Mina? [baby crying] I gotta tell ya, this is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. You can't get a decent hamburger in Mexico. You just gotta rely on the taco. Thank you. I'm better now. Aw! Are you sure? Yeah. I love this june bug. Could hold him all day. You guys eat first. I'm good right now. My stomach is still turning from the boat ride. Yeah, it was a little choppy out there today. I'm sorry. Ah, it was lovely. I'm-- I'm just not used to it. Yeah. Hey! Um, I wanted to ask. How are you settling into the new apartment? It's good? Everything is brand-new. Hmm. We love our little place, don't we? Do you, um-- Do you need anything else? We're good. Thank you. You've done enough. I still can't get over that whole life insurance thing. Yeah, no, that was, uh, pretty odd. What happened? [fussing] Oh. My husband never told me he had a million-dollar life insurance. I thought I'd end up in the streets with a baby. Mmm. Anthony remembered, thank God! And he made them pay. Can you imagine? [baby cries] Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay. [fussing] Yeah, yes, da! Yes! [Anthony] Hey! Right? Thanks to his daddy and Uncle Tony, this big guy's gonna grow up in such a nice neighborhood with lots of other kids. Yeah. And you're gonna go to college too. [Mina laughs] [gasps] Are you? [phone ringing] Are you gonna go to college? You better. Maybe he'll go to Berkeley. [Nick] Berkeley? Oh, no, no, no, not Berkeley, no. He's going to Notre Dame on a full football scholarship. Mark my words. [Carmen, Mina laugh] Yeah. Vanowen. [Larusso] Look out over your starboard bow by the breaker wall. There ya go. [chuckles] Hey. I see you guys are having a party without me. Well, I'm not upset about that. This isn't a social call. I figured it wasn't. I need a tag team to carry out a black warrant in San Diego right away. All right, cool. Tell the old man I'm not upset about not bein' invited to the party. Yeah, okay. Thanks. [sighs] Fuckin' Frankie. He's always wearin' that suit. What's that all about? I don't know, but he's got a job in San Diego. Do you wanna join? [clears throat] Yeah, count me in. [baby crying] All right. [Nick] Yeah. [all laughing] [Anthony] Oh, Lord. [singing in Spanish]
