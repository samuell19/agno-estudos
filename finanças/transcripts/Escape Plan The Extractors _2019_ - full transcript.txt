Now, you gotta use your imagination here, okay? Don't judge a book by its cover. This used to be Westinghouse Appliance Manufacturing. This sits on a 14-acre lot. This floor alone, 20,000 square feet. Tell me about Ohio, gentlemen. - Most astronauts and most presidents. - Really? I think 25 astronauts and eight presidents so far. Ms. Zhang, please. I don't think your father would agree. No, no. I like it here, Bao. I like both buildings. Car manufacturers, steel mills, electrical appliances. People here lost it all. They really wanna work. You can see it in their eyes. I think this is a really good move. - Hold on, Daya. - Dad, please trust me. Daya, hold on, hold on. The royal family knows we built this in the hull of a ship. They asked if we could build one under the desert. Twelve billion. Half in advance. Honey, opening plants outside of China may not play so well here. But bringing jobs into America will help our worldwide brand. I think it would be a good move. Both sides win. I really want to do this. Okay? So, 25 astronauts and eight presidents? So far. China's coming to Mansfield. Fantastic! Thank you. We are so glad Zhang Innovations is considering Mansfield for investment, and we are gonna do whatever it takes to get that deal done for you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We were very pleased with everything that we saw. - We'll definitely be in touch. - Fantastic. I look forward to your call. - And safe travels. - Thank you. This way, Ms. Zhang. Your bodyguard never relaxes. He doesn't take his eyes off you. I know. He is very thorough. But it is difficult to fill the shoes of Shen. Your father hated Shen. Shen did nothing wrong but love me. Ah! Seventh floor, there's a pretty receptionist. If you can charm your way through her, you can avoid security altogether. Abigail, I was thinking about what you were saying about us moving in together. You know, I think it's a pretty good idea, except for one small thing. I think it's called "snoring." What? Get out of here! I don't snore. If it ain't you, I don't know who it is. But I could put something, maybe a cork or something, and it'll keep you a little more quiet. All right, Ray, we gotta focus. We need to get that disk and make sure our names aren't tied to your ex-partner's black site activity, and we sleep better. And when I sleep better, I wake up happy, and I'm sweet, and you'll get breakfast in bed. All right, Abigail, that's a deal. I love you, Ray. I love you too. Mr. Chow, please. May I tell him what this is regarding? - No. - No? - It's a surprise. - He's not big on surprises. - Your name? - Friend. Mr. Friend is here. Yes, Mr. Friend. Chinese, with a briefcase and an umbrella. No, sir, not raining. Mm-hmm. Be right with you, Mr. Friend. Thank you. Sir? Surprise. I want that. - I want it too. - Give me the disk. You're not gonna shoot me, Ray Breslin. What's your name? - Shen Lo. - We're gonna see what's on that disk. And if I'm satisfied, then you can have it. Walk. Obviously, these guys were professionals. I think we can agree on that. They knew your timetable. They knew where you were gonna be. They knew when she was leaving. They knew when to be at the hangar. I'm gonna be honest with you. We've got nothing. This was your detail. You were responsible for her. Look, as I told him, we came into town... Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard all that. You're in town, you're looking at real estate. - I'm telling you the truth. - Was there anything different? Was there something that stood out to you? None of this is making sense. All right, just think about it, from the beginning. What was the first thing you saw? What's the first thing you remember? What can you tell us? There's gotta be something you can tell us, something that happened. You're the only person that's alive. I certainly can't ask them. You were responsible for her. Tell me. Who took her? - I don't know. - You have to know. I don't. You are supposed to protect my daughter with your life. If you did your job right, you'd be dead. Hey, hey! Whoa! Get him outta here! That's enough, that's enough! Get him outta here! Get him outta here! Come on, let's go. Let's go. Take your hands off me! Don't touch me! - Have a seat. I'm not done with you. - Let go! Don't touch me! If that disk is clear, you can be on your way. Am I supposed to say thank you? This is Shen Lo. - Hello. Very nice to meet you. - Hi. Everything's set. Hush and Abigail are waiting. Okay. - Ray, have you got a second? - I know what you're gonna say. I'm ready to get up from behind this desk if you wanna accidentally give me a chance. I'll think about it. - All good? - Clear. Nothing to tie you to him. You mean Zhang? What are you looking for? - I know you were in business with Zhang. - Do you? Your partner was. Zhang financed your company. - We had nothing to do with that. - Lester did. And how do you know that? I worked for him. Head of security for Zhang. Let me set you straight. Lester did the business, not me. Maybe it's time for me to interject into the conversation that they have offered double your standard fee. That's five mil, Ray. - So you like this? - Yes, I like it very much. From a financial standpoint, I like it. Why are you going after Zhang now? All the technology behind all of these black site prisons is Zhang's. But you know that already, don't you? What's your point? My point. Look at the data. Zhang's technology has made him billions on imprisoning and torturing thousands of people. Zhang Innovations is how he cleans that money. I'm gonna bring him down. It's personal. You wanna go after Zhang, do it yourself. We had no idea what was going on behind our backs. It's dead, and it's history. That's it. We're clean now. All right, so where is Lester Clark now? Haven't seen him for a long time. But I heard... he went on a long cruise... and never came back. Sleepy time, motherfucker. Fuck! No, no, no, no! Come on, come on. Fuck! Ray! Excuse me, Ray. There's a man up front. He said he found us through an Interpol contact. - Claims he has something you need to see. - All right, just bring him in. Can I help you? My name is Bao Yung. I'm looking for Ray Breslin. Right here. This is for you. What goes around, comes around. Ray Breslin, by the time you see this, I'll have Daya Zhang, and I'll be coming for you. Daya. - Is that... - Yeah. - Who is it? - Lester Clark Jr. My ex-partner's son. Who are you? I was head of security at Zhang Innovations. Daya Zhang was kidnapped. Why are you here instead of looking for her? It's not my fault. If it's not your fault, whose fault is it? Hey! Come on. Focus. - Where's this place? - Hush, go closer. On the wall. That. That picture. "Daniel in the Lions' Den." - The patron saint of prisoners. - Right. That's a prison chapel. - Eastern Orthodox, maybe? - Yeah. - But the writing's in Russian. - Yeah, it's probably Eastern Bloc. - Jules, get Trent. - On it. - What's up, Ray? - Hey, my friend. - Did you get the video? - Yeah. Yeah, I did. What's going down? My ex-partner's kid went off the rails. Yeah, obviously. - Where do you think this place is? - Definitely looks familiar. How familiar? - Not many of these places left. - All right, so what's your call? Devil's Station. Bad place, Ray. About 200 miles outside of Belarus. Okay, Mr. Skinny, can you help me out on this? For free? I'm just kidding. - I'll take care of the transportation. - All right. We'll be there tomorrow. I owe you. Yeah, what's new? You sure you don't wanna sit this one out? No way. Let you have all the fun? We got Hush back here. I'll go pack our bags, get the gear, be back in an hour. You got it. I'm coming along. When you said personal, how personal? I was very close to Daya. I have to go. Let's go, mystery man. And you, don't break anything. My father can pay for all of us. Quiet. No talking! What do you want? Please. Please don't do this. Okay? We can work something out. Please, please. We're not animals. We have rules. What's the point of having rules if people are gonna break 'em? Wait. This your friend? - Hey. - Just please don't hurt him, okay? L-lt won't happen again. I-I promise. I didn't hurt him. - You did. - What? No. - Continue. - All right, go! Come on! Go! You were head of security for Zhang Innovations. Yes. And you were with Interpol, yes? Yes. How could you let this happen? I would've given my life to save her if I could have. It's too late to say that. Glock.34, nine millimeter, long slide. Fancy. And when they took Daya, where was your fancy gun then? You failed her. I know. - Hey there. - I'm here. Sorry it took a little longer. Don't worry about it. I got tons of stuff to do here. All right, plane's waiting. It's gonna be a long flight. - We can have breakfast in bed. - Sounds good, Abigail. Abby? Abby! - Abby! - Ray! Fuck you! Ray! Abby? Abby! Abby! Fuck. Damn it! Abby! Why hasn't he called yet? These things can go different ways. - What does that mean? - Are you sure you don't have any enemies? I have the number one tech company in China. There are 1.3 billion people in China, and everyone uses my phone. Yes, I have enemies. Don't you think you should bring some assistance here from Cleveland or Chicago? There's no one you can think of that would want to harm your daughter? Let it ring twice. - Hello? - Zhang. What do you want? Encrypted. You could've helped my father. He put your sick technology in every one of his black site prisons, and you kept your hands clean. Now, when this is done, I'm gonna take your money, I'm gonna take your technology, and I'm gonna break you. Before, I wanted $500 million. Now I want $700 million, and it's going up. Watch. This is what funds our operation. Paid by countries and corporations to take the worst of the worst off their hands. Now, I'd kill 'em, but the checks keep on coming. Murderers. Serial rapists. Terrorists, hackers, narcos. The scum of the earth. The world is full of scum like your father. But you know that, right? Lock 'em up! I love that sound. - What are you doing? - She was my responsibility. Come on. We gotta go. It's an electric chair that was built in 1896. It's, uh, solid oak. It's as American as apple pie. Three hundred and 15 people died in that chair, including three women. They used to, uh... They used to put a hood like this over the inmate's head, but first they would put cotton and tape over their eyes so they didn't pop out when they fried 'em from the inside. You know who I am? My father built your company. Ray Breslin took over, pushed him out. That's not true. Bullshit. I had nothing to do with what happened. Yeah. Yeah, but you were there. So you're part of it. There you go. Couldn't do this without you, man. I'm sorry about Abby. We'll set it straight. Yeah. This is Shen Lo. Excuse me. He doesn't have a lot to say. - You know Jules. - Hey, Jules. And Bao Yung. - Security? - Mm-hmm. I've lost an asset before. - Really? - No. Never. - That's not funny. - Sure it is. Mr. Zhang. Luoshen. You know about my situation? I know that Daya was kidnapped. I can save her. Shen. Shen! If you want her alive, do what I say. Luoshen. I only wanted the best for her. And this is why she was taken. - Shen, tell me what to do. - Don't take the kidnapper's calls. Do you want your daughter back? - Of course. - Then do what I say. But what if that provokes him? Aren't you always supposed to play to their demands? The longer you delay talking to him... the longer she lives. Shen... Straight up, how bad is this place? It's bad. This place is a maze, Ray. It's a hellhole like I've never seen. Look, you got me this far, man. This is not your fight. If you wanna pull out, I get it. No, I got your back, man. I'm here for you. Let's do it. Wong. Yeah? I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Stay positive. Wong. Yeah? We'll get out of this together. We will. What the fuck you looking at, chopsticks? Back up, Sonny. Open 'em up. Come on. Come on. Out of the hostages, who has the highest security clearance in your father's company? I know you're all geniuses, and I know you're all the best and the brightest. But who does he trust with sensitive matters? I don't know. Trade fucking secrets. Who has the clearance? Come here. Is it this guy? Huh? Look. Look, look. No? Come here. Come here. What about this guy? Look at him. Look at him. Does he have the clearance? Tell me, or I'll shoot him in the fucking head. l-lt's me. Stop. I do. No. Don't do it. Once he has the information, he'll kill us. Wait! No! Lock her up. You're gonna give me access to Zhang's restricted developments. Uh... Let's try this a different way. I want you to teach me how to speak Chinese. You're gonna teach me how to say, "Tell me, or I will shoot you in the face." But in Chinese. What? Teach me how to say, "Tell me, or I will shoot you in the face," in Chinese. There... There is a five-year projection plan. I want everything. What do you need, a laptop? - L... - Don't say "can't." Those are last words. I'll get him a laptop. Hush, what have you got? Deploying drone now. Where do you think they're holding the hostages? The guy definitely called from the prison chapel, which is right there. You got the east block, west block, administration. - How big is this place? - Over 200,000 square feet. What kind of shells are those? Dragon's breath. You know what that is? Yeah. Planning on burning this place to the ground? Yeah, if we're lucky. Listen up, guys. Uplinking drone feed now. Thanks, Hush. Okay, we've got two cell blocks. Uh, the thermal drone is showing... 30... No, 40. Forty bodies in the west block. - 40 what, prisoners? - It looks like it. They're spaced evenly. Jesus Christ, he's running a black site. All right. What else, guards? Guard tower. Looks like three people. Weak spots. What's our way in? Come on, Jules. There's two heat spots on the roof. One is covered, one might be accessible. - I can get up there. - I don't doubt that. What are we waiting for? - We don't run in blind, kid. - We're wasting time. - Daya is my responsibility. - Hey! I got someone in there too. Never seen anyone go to a fight in a sports car before. - Hey, where you going? - You know me. I work better alone. I may be late... ...but I'll make a big impression. Good luck. Les. Les, what are you doing? What are you doing? You gotta stay the course, man. Look, I know you want revenge, but we gotta get that money. You knew my father. - He was good to me. - Yeah. But he's all gone. You're still here. Let's get the money and live right. - Fuck this shit with that bitch. - Hey. - Hey. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, she's a distraction. - Uh-huh. I say we kill her and be done with it. Do me a favor, Frankie. Just keep doing what I say, okay? Les. We gotta kill her. Do what I say! Okay. What's with you and Les's father? You were his partner, and he sold you out. Why? Five million. And Daya's father's connected to this too? Lot of fathers here. Hey, Ray, look at this. What do you got? It looks like there might be a weak spot in the bathroom. Bathroom. The sewer system. - Jules, come on. - I'm on it. I got tunnels. Tunnels. You have time. The sins of the father are not the sins of the son. We have visitors. - We got visitors. - Oh, yeah. We got visitors! Devil's Station. - Status. - Standing by. See anybody? Nothing yet. That can't be. - That's all. - Check the guard towers? Yeah. No signs of life. Something's wrong. This is very wrong. - Stay sharp, guys. Stay alert. - You too. What the fuck. He knows we're coming. He knows we're coming. You familiar with the legend of Nian? Honeypot. He's using Daya as bait. What did you have with her? Were you together? We hold. This is a joint operation. We don't engage. Shit. It's... It's a Chinese legend. Yeah. I wanna hear it. Tell it to me. Um... in ancient times, there was a monster called Nian. Every spring, Nian would come out and eat the villagers and livestock. And then one day, they discovered that... burning bamboo scared the monster off. Made a crackling sound, didn't it? Yes. They invented firecrackers to re-create that sound. I'm gonna leave you out here... fight the monster inside. Pow, pow, pow. Hey! Don't do that again. We work together for Daya. - Then what are we waiting for? - We wait for Breslin. I don't work for Breslin. Showtime, everybody. Let's go! You know what to do. Go now. Hey. Watch this. Armed and ready. You need to stop doing that. We wait for Breslin. Zip him up. Let's go. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bodyguard. You did exactly what I thought you'd do. You led me to Ray Breslin, helped me capture his girl. Now, you two, you both have wasted your time and your lives. Ah. Look who's here. Gentlemen, you have two choices. You can either... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you staring at him? - I wasn't. - Yeah, you were. - No. - You were staring right at him. Mm-mmm. You two know each other, don't you? Something's going on here. I can sense it. I sense something. Why do you look at me like that? You gotta see this through my eyes. My father died boiling at the bottom of a ship. I'd have had more respect if you sat him down in a chair, explained what he did wrong, and then you put a bullet in his head. I'm sorry. You hear that, Ray? Am I coming in loud and clear? Abby. You're missing all the fun here, Ray. Keep listening, buddy. This is all for you. He got in the tunnels. Leave Breslin's girl with me. Hey, Ray, I want you to watch something. Have a look at your phone. Fuck! Fall down. Get up! Go inside. Sir, I suggest you answer the phone. Shen said not to. That's not how this works. Answer the phone! Your father won't answer the phone. Breslin. Hey! Hey, you smell that? Sound the alarm! Shut up! Hey, shut up! Shut your fucking mouths! Shut up! - Come on! Move! - Move back! Let me see your hands! Don't move! Get the fuck down! - Give me your hands! - Get the fuck down! Get down! Down in front! Go! Go! What? Breslin is nearby. Take care of the prisoners. Bring me that fuckin' kid on the computer. I'll take care of Breslin. All right. Wong. We need to find Wong. Did you hack in? Psst! Come on! Let's go. Why'd you kill her? Being with you killed her. This is payback. Whoo! Was it worth it? Your old man hated you! Ah, you're full of shit, Ray! Know what, Ray? She didn't even scream. Kinda just gurgled. You did this for your father? You loved your father? You loved your father? Come on. Hit me. Hit me for your father. You wanted me, you got me. Come on. You call that a fuckin' hit? - You fuckin' pussy. - Wait, wait. I'll fuckin' kill you. Let me tell you about my father. Let me tell you about my fuckin' father. Get up. Get up. That's right. Let me tell you about my father. Really? He was the meanest son of a bitch in the world. Know what he said? Know what he said? You know what he said? He said, "You should learn to forgive, son. You shouldn't be so mean." I said, "You know, it's too late. You made me what I am." Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh. Don't say anything. Shh. Don't say anything. - Wait, wait. - Shh. This is what it... This is what it felt like. Please accept my sympathy for your loss. No. Remember Shen? He will be taking me home. You don't mind, do you? Well, I had other plans, but for you I'll break them. I'll take care of Abigail's arrival arrangements. Appreciate it. Hey. - There's something you gotta do. - What? You gotta forgive yourself. Wasn't your fault. Not gonna be so easy to do. I'm done with prisons. - No more prisons? - No more. That's music to me. Any ideas? Anything outside sounds good. Outside is good for your health. Let's talk about this. You got any ideas? What do you think about South America? It's kinda far away. Before you say no, remember, you owe me. I know this guy down there. He's a little shady, but I'm telling you... A little?
