He's coming! Agha is coming! - Welcome Agha, let me kiss your hand. Agha, Haraptar village is honored. - Let me kiss. - OK. That's enough! - Hırpıt Ali, is he here? - How could he refuse your order, Agha? - Hırpıt. - Yes Agha - Did you spend all the money I gave you? - We spend all on food agha. You better did not steal any of it, It was Agha's money. I swear on bread, no. I'm son of a bitch if I did it. ## Cheers for Agha ## Start! ## Cheers for Agha ## Agha is the greatest... - So, he is not loosing? - What is your hurry, idiot. We are hungry. We were waiting for this so long. How stupid you are: if he looses that quick... Agha would understand. Then, you'd have to forget about the food. ## Cheers for Agha ## Heyt! Let's take him up! - Agha, can we start the feast? - Go ahead! [Allah... Allah... Allah...] - Greetings aghas. - Welcome agha. Do you have a seat for God's guest? ... We are coming from far away. ... The poor (women) did not eat anything all day. - With your permission. - ... Who is the groom? - What groom? - Isn't this wedding feast? - No, it's wrestling feast. - Do you wrestle around here? - Not really, but our Agha is into it. - To watch? - No, to wrestle. Really? - ... Are you kidding with me agha? - I swear. He learned in military service. ... he wins against everybody. He wins against this bear, really? Yes, who understands what an agha can do? ... They are noble, strong. They win. - ... so, where are you from, where are you going? - From far villages. We are peasants. - we are looking for a piece of bread (work). - Knock on another door. ... This village is starving if not for Agha's wrestling, we would be dead. Welcome Agha. You have a guest. My God, we are waiting for rain, and who you are sending to us? - Do not forget to polish my boots! - Yes Agha. - Ooo, my friend! - Welcome, it's an honor. - How nice to see you. Please sit. We are still here Abuzer Agha. ... but you became an urban man. You are not coming here anymore. - ... You forgot your old land! - You know that is not true, you are always on my mind. Let's first catch our breath. They made me tired today. You don't give up these peculiar habits of yours. Are you still wrestling? Its a hobby. Everybody has one, mine is wrestling. - Wrestling aside, How is business agha? - Forget about the business. Once in a while... - I heard your business depends on rain? - So, it is up to God. No rain, no crops. Banks don't give credits. As you see, we are embarrased ... ... we need some more time for our debts. Don't worry, we can wait. But agha, why are you doing this? Sell everything, move to the city as I did. no rain: trouble; crops rots: trouble; cattle ill: trouble. - ... and lots of trouble from the peasants. - You are right. God knows. But we were born here Damn it! We are known as the Agha once. .. If I leave, what would people say? What would peasants say? so many people depend on us. We live also for the fame of it agha. Besides , I do not know trade, I would not be able run a gas station like you. You know better then. Pray it rains then. - Otherwise it's no good. - Where are you going? What do you think? Mountains of work waits for us. Not yet. I cannot let you go only with a cup of coffee. I swear I have lots to do. Work does not wait in the city. What do you mean? We open a bottle of rakı now, ... I also make some çiğ köfte for you. Look agha, work in the city is different. You cannot neglect... [Noise outside] Why are these crying? What is happening? Don't run! - I'll kill you dishonest woman! - Dad! Dad, stop! Let me! Let me! I'll kill this woman. - I'll kill and get rid of... - You'll go for other women.. - Anne sus! Dad, stop! Dad shame on you! Look we have a guest. - Let me kiss your hand Agha. - Who is this pimp? Don't you remember? He was born to your hands, Abuzer Agha. - Who is Abuzer Agha? Son of your friend hairy Muzo Agha. He is with god now. Which pimp is hairy Muzo? Fuck Muzo. I want a woman! Dad, don't make us ashamed. - See, he is kidding with us. - Come father. Don't touch! Leave me alone... I want a woman. ... I do not want Muzo, I want a woman. For God's sake do not laugh agha. - My father got heavy dementia. - Take him to a doctor. What we haven't done... We burned hundreds of candels in Sultan Seyhmus tomb. We had `Pir Habbab' pray for him. Maybe 10 times. But no. - He is obsessed with women. - I said take him to a doctor. What can a doctor do that `Pir Habbab' cannot? But his mind works on his thing very well. But father is a womanizer. How many wifes have he had? 4. He buried 3 of them, But my mum still resists. - and father climbs to flat walls. - With your permission. Go safely. This visit does not count. Greetings to your wife and children. ... and do not worry, I'll pay my debts. Don't mention it, don't worry. Of course, you want to get more interest. Smart Abuzer. - Dad, dad! Hey dad! - Dad, Dad! - Where were you? - Dad, give us some money. - What are you going to do with money? We will go to city with kahya Musallim to buy lokum. Her it is. - Dad, me too, me too. - No, you are a girl. - Where were you? And they ask for money without shame? - Run! Run! - What's happening, mom? They are stealing my candies. I'll buy for you more. They would steal again. Mom, they are kids. Don't get upset for everything. Your kids are shit, you are shit too, ...and your dad is worst of shit. He started saying `I want women' again. ...He wants a woman over me. He beats me every day. I hope I'd die, so that you celebrate it. Honestly, you have no intention (to die)... Agha singing: Değirmen üstü çiçek, oy naz ey, naz eyleme. # Orak getirin biçek, ölürem kızlar naz eyleme. # Değirmen üstü... - Be calm! Money is going. You sing! You wrestle, OK. Do you have to give a feast every time? Is our business feeding the hungry dogs? Woman, my peasant come to see their agha wrestling. Shouldn't I treat them right? But the hole in our ass getting bigger. We sold three villages that were my fathers wedding gift. That's enough you are skinning me! You are the first man who got dowry, instead of giving it. How could your father get rid of you otherwise? He needed a bonehead to take you, and he found me. There were hundreds of good men asking to marry me. This was why your door had spider webs. Slow down! You spend the dowry, the other villages are gone too. Only Haraptar left. If you continue wrestling, it will go too. Shut up! You are a trouble. If I was as wise as now, I would not marry you. ... Not 3, 13 villages wouldn't worth the trouble. Give this to me! I can wash myself. Aaah! God, I'm burned! Where is my boots! Don't you have someone to polish my boots! Here they are Agha, they are ready. Don't be late again, or you'd all get beaten. Yes, Agha. - What is happening, Kahya? What are they asking? - We want permission to speak. - Talk. Agha, we are in bad shape this year. We are ashamed to ask more from you. Our only hope is rain. What do you want from me? Rain prayer is our last hope. Then go and pray? Agha, prayers would not work without Seyh. Then go and pray with the Seyh. That part is shit, Agha. Seyh said "I would not pray for rain unless... ...the Agha kisses my hand". What are you saying? An agha do not kiss hands, pimp! - An agha do not kiss hands, pimp! - Dad, let me talk. - Agha! - Don't say agha! - Don't say agha! Pity us, Agha. Agha, please do not make us starve. - Don't get me started with your Agha! - Don't get me started with your Agha! - Agha do not kiss hands! - Agha do not kiss hands! - Dad, stop! Go on your own business. - I want a woman! Dad, you are shaming us, go inside.. Let my arm go! I want woman! Hear me? I'll get rid of mine, I'll get a new one. Find me a woman! A beautiful one. Marry me! I'll get rid of mine, I'll get a new one. Find me a woman! Marry me! Come, what trouble did you bring to me? Please don't say that Agha. What is it? Agha, this guy here... Get out! Didn't I tell you to wait outside! Who is he? He's called Kekeş Salman. He wants a job. He was a peasant of Bedirhan Agha. He looks like a sly man. I did not like him. So, tel him to go. Agha, please do not let us starve... - Don't let us starve! - Get up, stop acting! Agham, look at this poor innocent baby. ... (s)he has not eaten anything for days. ... Agha, this is my wife, this is my sister. Both of them are hungry. Both of them do whatever you ask, Agha. where can we go? Who else can we ask for work? Please do not let us starve. They said Agha would not let us starve. Please Agha! they said he is great, he is merciful, he would protect his peasant, he would feed... What can you do? Whatever you ask... I can work in the field, ... I can use a tractor, I learned in military service. Look, he can use a tractor. Give him some work. But Agha! Do as I say! Yes, Agha. - ... prayers for Agha ... Get out! Go, go! But Agha, we do not have a tractor? Do not exagerate pimp. We may buy one. In the old days, my grandfather used to tell me, these places were so different Green, like no one has ever known. You were generous. Animals would eat as much as they want. Crops everywhere, this high. What had happened that you changed? Somebody did something wrong, but who? I suspect my father. Or, is your problem with me? Why is everything so different now? My beloved God, please give this blessing. Do not make me go to that pimp seyh. I cannot kiss anybody's hand! Please do not make me belittled. Please give some rain. Please... otherwise things are too bad. I'm barely holding as you may have realized. Here it is. You'll stay here. ... I'll make you regret if you do not work right. - Yes agha. I didn't like you Kekeş Salman. But ... but ... anyway. And, I make you responsible from Agha's boots. You're doomed if they do not shine like mirrors. Yes, agha. Fuck your boots, agha, and you pimp. Agha, at least be decent here. Nowhere else left for us to go. Shut up! If you did not steal from Bedirhan Agha... ...we would not be away from our home. I will not hear this again! Otherwise I'll kill you. OK? I'm asking you! OK? - ## The kid reading a story about Ali (Muhammed's son in law) ## Read it instad of stuttering. ## story about Ali continues ## Hey! Ali is the real wrestler, real hero. Who is us compared to him. O holly man. Go on, read! The best story of him is 'Hayber Rock'. Read it 100 times, I would not be bored. Read! You slept too? Ooo, everybody is in deep sleep. ... I'll take a walk then. - Get out of my sight, get out! - Who are you? Where are you? - Get out! - Get down from the tree and let me see your face! ... shameless pervert! - How are you talking to your father? - Dad, what are you doing on that tree? - I'm watching the woman, get out! - You are great Abdo Agha, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - It just caught my eye. - Let's go, shame on you. - I want a woman! - Over my mum? - Your mum is useless... - Come on, be quick! - There is a lot of cleaning to do yet. How slow are these women! - Did you write? - I did. - Well done. Read now. - Dear brother, Who ever escapes here is winning. All the former aghas moved to city now. Should I move to the city too? What do you think? Thats all dad. - Dad. Hey Dad! - What? Write now... Wel done Kekeş! You polished them well. With your grace, Agha. You have a telegram, Agha. Let me see. We have guest from Ankara. The VIP from our party. - Get prepared. - Yes, Agha! Pimp! It's not your call. Know your place! Get out! Yes, agha! What is it? Tell me whatever you want. Peasants ask about the rain prayer. - May you have many to kiss your hand. - Holly seyh... - The reason of our visit... - I know. But, forgive me. I'm tired, I'm ill, I cannot go for rain prayer. Holly seyh, you can only rescue us. Your Agha is also quite capable. Whatever you are, I kissed your hand. What else do you expect? You want me to kiss your ass too? I will make you beg more Abdo Agha's son. If you do not go for that rain prayer, I'll tell everything. - What do you tell? - How I busted my father Abdo Agha and.. your wife in the hay store. You being hostile to us for that reason. - You cannot do it. - Watch me now. - Dear elders, this seyh... - If the peasants are in such a hard condition, ... I help even if it kills me. ### seyh praying ### Coming! A cloud is coming! This is all your prayer's power. You could make only 5 drops fall. I did what I could. But there is an impure among us. You are the impure, Didn't we all do ritual washing if front of you? It wasn't enough to clean! What sort of seyh are you! You made us walk up and down for three days... Agha, you have guests. - To get rid of my grandfather, sultan gave 1000 donum land. - .. He wanted him to stop revolting. Sultan ... Our Agha's çiğ köfte is very famous. - Not at all. - It is so delicious. My grandfather had 100 donum land. He donated 10 donum of it... 5 dönümünü of it... Taste! - Very good. Go ahead, taste some. Sultan of the mountains, my grandfather. - Eskiya, eskiya. - Really? The main trouble for the Padişah. - Prepare the meat. - Prepare the meat. Yes, agha! Our support here is good Agha. People listen to my word here. Seyh switched to the other party. We sold all of them, finished it all... ... by the way I want a woman... Their welfare depend on me. The peasants listen to me. Let's go to the village after the meal. They are waiting for us. Please start. Kofte is ready. Listen villagers. I will not talk much. These friends came for you. Listen them good. All of them are fighters of the right way. You know who to vote better than me anyway. Our great founder said: "Villagers are the masters of the nation." For this reason, after God, we trust in you. - Because we choose you as our master - This is yours, and this is yours... - ...and we promise you that... - Here. What are you doing Kekeş? Why? Am I not voting? This is Agha's money. Get out! Here, take your money. Go safely. Greetings to the master. - Do you have any orders for us Agha? - What do you mean by order? ... Of course, we may have some requests in time. Goodbye. - Aaa. - Don't run away! - Why are you running from your Agha? Why are you escaping? - Aaa. - She's like a gazelle! Dad! dad! Are you crazy! What are you doing? You womanizer... - Get out of my way, I'm the Agha. - Of course you are. What is happening to you nowadays? You became completely restless. - Where is Agha, Kekeş? - He went home with his father. Dad, I beg you, be rightful. Is it proper for you to harass peasant girls? I want that girl. She is sexy. - Dad... - Agha! - With your permission, Agha. - Come. We lost our face already! Agha, seyh is going to the village, with his party members. Really? So, he is starting the counter attack. His breath is not enough for this. First he should make it rain. The peasants now know who he is. Agha, there is another wrestler who wants to compete with you. Really? My fame is spreading, isn't it? You made me as famous as like Sultan Aziz. Where is your sister? Working in the barn, Agha. Psst, Hatice! Go away! You thought I'm my father aren't you? - What is your name? - Kiraz, Agha. Kiraz. Nice name. Kiraz. Sister Kiraz. Apologies for my father's behavior. How can I dare? He is an agha. It is worse. An agha do not set his eyes on things unrightfuly. An agha do not leer at others wifes and daughters. Even if he loves a lot, dies of his love, he would not disgrace himself. Don't mention it Agha. He is old, he does not know what he is doing. I know his young days too. Kiraz ha? Like your lips... Stupid me! What did I say? I turned into my father. Get back to yourself stupid. You are smart when it comes to preaching. Calm down! I'm not going to be calm. - Quiet! I have wrestling tomorrow. - First, wrestle with me. No. I would loose my power. Wrestle with me, break my bones! ... Hey big wrestler, wrestle with me! - You are wrestling with everybody but not me! - Quiet! People will hear! Stop! I'm going to my father house tomorrow. Go to the hell. ### cheers for Agha ### He is acting. So that Agha would not realize. Agha's state is not good. - He is smashing Agha. - I think he is acting. What acting? Agha is loosing! Yavaş ulan. Leave Agha! The feast has gone. Gone, feast gone. I told him to loose, the animal understood `win'. Let's cheer up Agha, it's not finished yet. ### cheers for Agha ### Hey, what are you doing! ### cheers for Agha ### I won! I won! ### cheers for Agha ### - Shut up! Agha, shall we start the feast, start eating çiğ köftes? Do not get me started with your çiğ köfte. Kahya, bring my horse! Be quick! Agha is moaning badly, as if he is dying. Is it you Kiraz. You look bad Agha. No, I'm alright. Ah! He won by trickery. He put his hand through my pants. Ah! Turn Agha. Your smile is so nice. - Your hand is so light. - What happened? What happened to my man? And look at my luck. My poor man! Get out! I take care of my Agha. You continue wrestling, you found your trouble finally. Ah! Be slow! You deserve. He should have done worse. So, you do not wrestle with me. Enough! Shut up! For the good of our nation and our people. ... you know which party you're going to vote for. - Get out! I have things to do here. - Yes, agha. Agha, I'm here. Tell me, how much do you want? - How much would you pay? - You tell me! You know the commodity is good. Woman like Kiraz is rare in this world. Dowry should be accordingly, shouldn't it? I'll take Kiraz. You tell me how much. Let's agree, but you tell me how much. I'll take Kiraz, I'll have a wedding to her honor. Leave the honor aside, how much ... - I think you are even late agha. All of the friends are in different business now. There is no good in the soil anymore. Do not be stubborn. Greetings to everybody. Your brother Behram. Come on son. Let's read the 'Hyber Rock' story again. Kahya! Come here. Yes Agha. - What is wrong? - Nothing, but it's a little bit sour. What is it? - You'll get upset. - No, I won't. You will not? No! I promise! - The elections... - What happened to the elections? Your party did really bad. Only one vote from our village. What? What are you talking about? How many people do we have in the village? - I swear, only one vote. - This cannot be! One vote? - It's my vote Agha! - No it's my vote! You pimps! You two voted that one, where is mine then? Agha, kill me if you like but here is the truth: All of us vote to the other party because of this. - What is it? - A deed. - What deed? - Seyh gave it. It is deed for a piece of land in Heaven. He arranged very good locations. Your father took one too. You idiots! First try to get a deed in this world! They are already taken Agha. There is none in this world for us. You deserve whatever this Seyh is doing to you! - Shame on you too! - Don't talk like that. You need to think about the other side too. - Are you there? - Here. Yes Agha, I'm here. - Use it well. It was a good purchase wasn't it? - Yes. The woman is good! You worked hard. But unfortunately, all the work was in vain without rain. .. Like last year, like previous years, your Seyh was not useful either. The harvest is not enough. God help us all. - Agha is right. - We couldn't survive without him. God spare Agha for us. This year, ... 15 temin (a measure) to plant for next year. 5 temin for oxen, for their effort. When it comes to peasant's share: I reduced your 2/3 share to 1/3. What is he saying? What are we going to do now? Agha don't do that. Kill us it's better, Agha! We'd starve. Pity us Agha. I have one more news: I decided to buy a tractor. This means I will not need most of you. You are great Agha. Please don't leave us! You are better off than me. I do not have land in Heaven. You can sell them, and maybe pay your debts to me. I could not get any credit because of the elections. Now, you take some of the trouble. - Kahya! - Yes, Agha! - Split it the way I said. - Yes, Agha. We wanted 3 of 3, do we now get 1 of 3? Run, he is beating the mother again! Oy oy! He went crazy again. He insists that he's going to marry that slut! He broke all my bones! Mum, I'll talk my dad. Don't worry. Stop! Dad what are you doing? I'm your son. Don't you see? - Are you allowing me to take this woman? - Listen to me! How old are you? And how old is the girl? I'm better than 72 young men. It's enough. May earth make you satisfied. You fucked the whole world It didn't stop your hunger! You made the Seyh our enemy because you can't keep it in your pants. - I'd rather die than marry that old cripple. - You will! How can you reject Agha's request? Stupid woman, be smart. He is about to die. He paid shit load of dowry. I'm saving you from misery. Get out! .. Slut! Get out! I'll kill who ever insults Kiraz! Go away! I paid the dowry. This is finished! I know how to get it back. You did not have any money? You were getting from me? If you don't allow me to marry Kiraz, I regret I have a son like you ... ... and go away from this place. No! God forbid! I'd go, and you'll never see me again! Don't go my man. I'm fine with second wife. ... don't go. My horse, bring me Åžahin! Quick! - I'm going to the city. - Yes, Agha. Agha, what is happening? Agha, agha! What did I do wrong Agha? Agha look, what is happening? - You idiot! - Agha, you do not listen to me. You decietful Kekeş. How could you do that? I'm innocent Agha. He threatened me. He said he'd kill me. He is an Agha's father his word is my order Agha. Lier! I understand you deceived my father. How could you do that to Kiraz? Agha! Welcome, which wind brought you here? Don't ask. I got upset in the farm. I decided to visit you. You did very good. - Son, take care of the horse! - Greetings aghas. - Greetings. What is happening, is there a funeral? Soon there will be ours. Don't talk to him! Don't you know he is the Agha's man. - What is it aghas? - As if you do not know! He threw a handful of wheat in front of us. We do not know how to survive the winter. So, why are you still here? Go away? - Where? - To the city, to Istanbul. Instead of starving to death here, die there. If you are smart, you can even get rich in the city. There is no chance here. Agha is our owner. He would not let us. Do not get permission then. Just run away. Your father is so terrible. You need to run to save your... Please do not laugh agha. I was dishonored in front of everyone. So, you are marrying your father. What can I do Abuzer? He says he wouldn't give his blessing otherwise. He says, he'd go away. I'm more upset about Kiraz. - Who is she? - ... My new mom. You are upset, let's try to enjoy this evening. Quiet. Hey all of you! Kekeş, let's say we did what you suggest. We forgot that we are Agha's property, and escaped to the city. Yes. But how? We do not have any money? He is right. Now answer that. - Sell the wheat. - Which wheat? - There is none. - Agha's storage is full with it. God forbid! Are we thiefs? You are taking your share of 2/3. You'll sell and invest with it. - This pimp is kidding with us. - Wait, Ramo. Let's say we took our share. - Who can we sell it to? - I can arrange that. - What is this wisky? - Ballantines agha. - Didn't you have Walker? - This is a better one agha. Pour it then. Stop! you are tickling me. - How is it going agha? - Almost ready. Looks wonderful. Let me taste. Even çiğ köfte lost its taste. ... my poor Kiraz. Hey Abuzer Agha, can your car take you home when you are drunk? The best of the horses Sahin. Psst. We do not want to disturb Kiraz. Is this how an agha behaves? You should not be an Agha. You shameless. Kiraz ... Kiraz. How nice a name. makes me feel different... You shameless.. What sort of words are these? Kiraz. # Urfalıyam ezelden # Gönlüm geçmez güzelden Greetings Aghas. Welcome. Welcome. Let me kiss your hand agha. # Anam olasan Ömer. Babam olasan Ömer. # Yetim kalasın Ömer. Benim olasan Ömer. Slow! Quiet! Don't make a noise! # Zülüf gerdana düşer. Zülüf gerdana düşer. Cheers! Nobody is around because of the wedding. - Who'd think of robbing Agha at the wedding night? We are not thiefs. We are taking our share of 2 of 3. Yes, we are taking our rightful share. Aghas! Raise your glass for Abdo Agha's honor. Cheers! Agha, you are not making the çiğ köfte? Don't worry, Cemo makes it as good as me. How can I dare, Agha. Get lost tonight. No one should be left. Take the wheat to the man I told you. If he does not buy? We would be helpless. Give him my name, he'd buy. It's his job. Shameless woman! God may punish you! Aghas! It's time. Let's escort our Abdo Agha. May you be strong agha. Do not forget my share! Come to the city. Your share will be waiting for you. - Goodbye - Goodbye. - We'll be rich brother. - Yes we will be. Grandpa died! Grandpa died! Apo Agha is dead! Apo Agha is dead! ## ... prayers ... Thank you. Thank you. Where is my peasants? why did they skip the funeral? They did not show themselves today at all. As if the village is completely empty. In the old days, people would respect the dead. Shame on them. If you beat them one by one, then ... Allah! Who did that? Who did that? Who is that traitor? Who?! Who can steal agha's property? Get all the peasants here! Go, go! Get in the row! Stop moving, get in the line! Stay there!

Let me see! - Hey blood brother! - Yes, finally you know! My friend! how come? You should have told me in advance. You turned all gray. Eh, as if yours are all black. You look like our old donkey. Hey! Donkey is your kin. Could there be any better donkey than you? Are you alone? Where is your family? - They are outside. - Let's go then. Look who is here. All of you very welcome! - Mother how are you? - Fine Behram, fine. Take care of the shop. I'll be at home. OK, master. Get in agha, get in. Please. Sister, you do not know this rascal. We used to play "kındık" when we were kids. ...he used to always cheat. He would cheat, and I'd beat him. You had done well. Well done. Brother here you are. Thank you. - It had been clear even then what sort of person he is. - Now, my peasants are worse than you at cheating. Sometimes, I miss those days. When we were kids. Now work, work, work without break. - My blood brother, Istanbul is not easy. I worked hard. There is my my bricks, my sweat in all the buildings around. - All my people have their own houses. - Be careful! He is not used to sit at the table. But at the end, I managed to provide for my both sons good good conditions. One has the furniture shop. The has an electronics shop. Now, it's my time. If we get together... ...Istanbul will see real men. I hope these are not staying here long. How can I know? He did not tell me before. - Mum, I'm full. Damn. What kind of city is this? What is this, for God's sake? I lost my way twice. I was really afraid. - Can you offer me a coffee? - Run. Black, please do not forget to get some water too. It's so crowded. It feels all are coming at me. If you walk in these clothes, this is what happens. - Even your people adopted to Istanbul. - Who? Villagers from Haraptar, they opened a cafe. How can Istanbul not be so crowded? Damn them. What are we going to do, Behram? What? I brought some money, I'd like to start some business with you. Brother, business here is not easy. It makes brothers enemies. So, what should I do? At least give me some advise. I don't know anyone else. I do not know what to advise. Istanbul is a different world. Everybody has to stand on his own feet. - Do not beat mum, please! - Shut up! I wish I could get rid of you both! Trouble makers! - Thats enough! - Don't intervene mum. What happened? What is all this mess? - The glass of the display has gone. - Nothing happened to the kids right? No worries then. They eat, they do not do anything. The kids are monsters. I've never seen like this in my life. - Should I tell my brother to go? - I'm not going to be their servant! I'll take care of it. - He is the Agha. - Indeed he is. Agha. You cannot run from Agha. I found you at the end, didn't I? Now tell me, Should I call the gendarme? Or police? Or, should I kill you myself? - How ever you wish Agha. - We are all your servants Agha. Shut up Hırpıt, you should have though before stealing my wheat. - Live long! (=bless you!) - You too Agha. - You are all thieves! - Kekeş Salman made us do it. - I swear he convinced us. - Did he also tell you to run away? - Indeed he said so. - I don't care. The police is just outside, get together. - What should I do with you, I wish find your trouble by God. - We already found it. - Forgive us. Agha, forgive us! Come everyone, kiss Agha's hand. Let me kiss Agha, thank you. Agha, thank you. Get a tea for our Agha. Hırpıt, since when the peasants pay for the tee ...in the presence of Agha? Tea for everyone, from me. Sit down. Thank you agha. Agha, did you really come here to find us? No, I came here to settle. We sold the village, thanks to you. So, you'll become the Agha of Istanbul. And the wrestler. No, no wrestling anymore. First, I need to find a house. Your wish is an order Agha. We'll find you one. - We'd spread around and find you one. - Seriously? Where were you agha? We are all waiting for you. I did a lot of work. I sent a telegram to Kahya for the furniture. - Where are you going to store them? - I got a house. I shouldn't bother you long. You should not worry about that agha. You know, this is Istanbul. Everybody has to stand on his own feet. Do not worry about me blood brother. Please leave it here. No, not there, here. What is it to you, servant? Go mind your own business! Kahya, you do not tell anything about our lands. Better do not hear about it, Agha. We were cheated badly. They are building a dam nearby. Our land got very valuable. But, we've sold already. The politician knew it. He bought more than 1000 donum. He bought all around. I do not know for which company. It's a secret. God's will Kahya. That son of a bitch! - Agha! - What? - Furniture is in place. - So, well done. Do not you give us money? - What money? - Eh, these things work like that here Agha. - Go to Kahya. - OK. Where is my beloved mırra (=type of coffee)? Are they treating you badly Kiraz? No agha. Welcome, welcome... Who is here! Welcome to our city Agha! Let me kiss. How are you? Are you all settled? Are there more to do? Yes, Agha. Kekeş, they say you convinced them to steal the wheat? Did they? I swear it's a lie. They are jealous about my success. Pray to Kiraz, otherwise... - Look Agha. - What is it, I cannot see it? Salman Ticaret, I buy and sell scrap material. As you see, I'm an honorable trader. You do not have a bit of honor. Tell me why are you here? I missed you. Cannot I? And, I'm worried about Kiraz. Did you marry her? If not, I want to take her back, can I? How a disgraceful man you are. You do not understand from any thing. - Get out! - But agha... ...it is not possible to talk anything with you. Dad, dad... Give us some money. - What are you going to do with money? - We'll buy Tadelle (a chocolate bar). I want Barbie dad! - What do they want to buy? - I did not get it. - Be quiet, you'll be beaten otherwise. We used to eat on the ground nicely. Why did we switch to the table? - This is a city. - Yes, indeed. - Two piece of candies, 300 lira. - Ready money goes fast. I told you that we should not come. Mum don't say that again! Be careful, you wouldn't even pass for a servant. All the stupid people end up with us. Kahya, it is now time to start a business. Yes agha, tell me what to do. - Do you have cigarettes? - Wait a while. - Look what it says? - What? - It says: for sale. - So, Agha? It says it's for sale. Think! - Should we buy it? - Are we going to be sellers? What seller? It says "(super)market" at the door. You know better Agha. - Which cigarettes? - Bitlis. - We do not have it, do you want Samsun? - OK, make it two. - How is the business. - Fine, thanks to God. Why are you selling then? Don't ask, we bought a house on the other side. But commuting is a big trouble. - I cannot handle it after that age. I'll open another shop close to home. - But, you say it sells well here. - Why are you asking? We have intentions to buy. If you are serious, we can agree on a good price. Give me your hand, and tell me your price. - First you. - You are the owner, you first. We did well, aren't we Kahya? Agha, you are a genius when it comes to trade. Uncle run, there is fight in your house. - Run, they are beating someone. - Kahya run! I wish God makes you blind! You shameless! What is happening? Come here, sister. Sister, come here. Stop it. Go away! Look, I'm talking to all of you. Kiraz, you too. If I see you fighting again, I'll kill you all. First you Kiraz. Don't cry Kiraz. Maybe we should send you to your brother. He earns good money. He is more or less an agha now. No, I won't go. Who ever fights again, I'll beat! First Kiraz. Back to your work! - Let me kiss Agha. - Thank you. Congratulations. - Congratulations, Agha. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Best of the olives. - And half a kilo of cheese. - Cheese is very god. - Make it a kilo then. Can you look at here? - Kahya! - Yes agha. Look, the customer is waiting. How are you calculating it? Get out of here. and... A box of tomato paste. The one behind... - This one? - No, no. The one up. - This? - Yes, this one. Are we going to wait all day for you? No, not this one. Agha, agha! It's all going down! Agha help! - What is going one here? You'll destroy the shop idiot! - Ouch! You clumsy woman! - What is it again? Sit down! You walk then! Heyt, stop it! Haydar, come here. Is it correct? 832 grams. Be careful. Look in front of you! You ruined half of the beans. They are so clumsy. It's all a waste. Not that one, this. Come on. - This? - The other, no no. - this, this... - this? - That. No that one. Yes, that one No the other. What are these eggplants doing in the fridge? - Forget about it. - She's gone. - Take this one too... - What are you doing here! Get out! Just a second. You dishonest woman! Ay! Aaa! - There is no limit to bribing, brother. - How is the bribe rates in your area? So, you still did not get it? Good ones to the front, bad ones at the back. And give the bad ones without them noticing. Yes, like this. Agha, you did the right thing. Running a shop was not for you. You are right. - Cigarettes? - With your permission agha. Muhtar, can you come here for a moment. Yes, agha. How could you get the cigarettes the Agha offered you? Agha was in the village, Kahya. This is the city. There is different ways to be agha here. It's time to learn. Tomatoes, tomatoes... Tomatoes, eggplants, tomatoes... That's it, that's the job. Not just muscle work like us. He's right. If you have money... Get a small truck... ...get the tomatoes. - Se how much they sell. Good money they should be making. - They should be making good money. Tomatoes... Kahya, kahya! Come here. I'll tell you something. Tomatoes.. Tomatoes.. Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Agha, shout a little bit, no body hears it. Maybe we should not disturb people. Tomatoes! - Tomatoes! - Agha, stop for a sec. Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Tomatoes. Tomatoes! Tomato seller! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! - Tomato seller, tomato seller! - Yes. - How much is it? - 3 kilos 200. - Too expensive. - No, it's not too expensive. - Make it a little lower. - 3 kilos 200, as I said. - Make it cheaper. - I swear I cannot. - OK, make it 6 kilos then. - Yes sir. - Agha, agha! - What? The truck is going Agha! Ulan! Ulan! - So you say it's not stolen? - No, it's probably us, the police. - What did we do to police? - Probably, you parked in wrong zone. - How can we get our car back? - First go the traffic office at Beşiktaş. Do you know where Beşiktaş'ı is? No, where? My God! Ask outside. You'll pay the penalty there, learn where you can learn where your car is. ...go there with the receipt of payment and find the officer there. - H/She will tell you at which parking place your car is. - After going to the park guards with your receipt... - It's all your fault. - Pray that it's not stolen. - What day is today? - Its the holy Friday. So, they told us that do not go before Monday, otherwise you wouldn't find anyone? - Yes, they said so. - What will happen to tomatoes until then! - Agha, good news! - What is it? - Come here. - What's going on woman? - Somebody wants to marry Kiraz. - Who is it? Look there, the one with the jacket. They offer good dowry. They will pay in cash. If you agree they, officially come and ask. Ee, Kiraz. someone wants to marry you. - Do you want to marry? - However you order Agha. Love meters do not work with orders. Do you want to marry him? You know the best. - It's not here. - But, this is the address. I swear it's not here. Agha, here it is. - We found it! - Is the tomatoes still good? Let's go, quick! - Rotten. - This is rotten too. - A good one. - This is gone too. - Another good one. - Rotten. Well, let's sell the rest and get new ones with the money. - It's smoking. - Yes, it's smoking. - What are we going to do? - Let's get out. Open it up. - The car is on fire Agha! - Water! Water! - Water! Water! we need water. - Do something, stop it! - What can I do Agha, it's burning. - Water. Water! Water, water where? Kahya, the car is burning completely. Run! Run! Ee, why did this burn? We started to sell the furniture. They are all from our ancestors. Good Lord help us. The reason failure is the car. Agha, no offense, but you should not have get into this tomato business. The reason the failure is the car. But, I'm getting used to the business. I have a very good idea now. - Agha. - What? I have something to tell you. It's enough, enough. - He has a good idea. - He's lying. He started to sell his furniture. He's completely broke. Everybody is moving to Istanbul. as if there is shit in here. - He used to be the great Agha. - We would be scared to death when we saw him. - What are you going to tell? - I do not know how to say it Agha. Tel me, don't worry. Agha, I do not know.. It's not good. That's true, but I have great ideas. We'll trade again. Agha, I could not send any money to my mother for a long time. I learned that she is ill. Here. - What should I do with them Agha. - Sell them. They are all valuable. - It should make some money. Send to your mother. - Agha I cannot do that. - I said, take it! I cannot Agha. Kill me, but don't do that. Mr. Musellim, I do not do that because I like you. I'm an Agha. I cannot be in debt. I cannot live indebted. The best is.. you take care of yourself. You are a big man. As long as you stay around me, it'll be worse. I give you your freedom. You can go. Agha, are you trying to kill me? Son, listen to me. Here is the end of agha-hood. Do you think I don't know what the villagers think of me? But, I'm an agha anyway. You can work as a carrier, you can work physically. But, I cannot. Do not waste yourself, go and survive. Let's wait more. Who was it? The landlord. - He's asking for the rent again. There is nothing more to sell. My mother become ill because of sadness. I'm starting a new business. I hope it wouldn't be like others. I don't understand these. They asked about Kiraz again yesterday. Let's give her away, no? Dowry may help us relieve. And if she also wants to marry the boy. So? Call Kiraz. Kiraz. Come here. Kiraz! It's time to decide. Decide, so that we can answer them. If you really need the dowry. Forget about the dowry! Do you want to marry him? Do you? No, I don't. No? Good then. Find us money! You live on our money. Look at our state, we sold everything we had. You could not do anything useful. You made us without land, money. You made us miserable. - Woman shut up! - I will not shut up. It's been a week we are eating the same thing. I want to ask from may father, you do not allow Kids are crying, mother is ill. The landlord wants the rent. An agha's daughter like me, look what state I am in. - I wish this city to be your tomb. She went crazy. Juicy lemons, juicy... Tax officers, Run! Move! Move. - What happened? - Quick, tidy up! - Which? - Which one do you want? - This? - This one? - That? - Yes. - Let me buy. - Her you are. - Hey! Lemons, juicy lemons! - Lemons, come. - Are lemons good? - They are juicy. - They do not look good. - I can cut one. - Hey, look. - I told you brother, these are crap. - No, don't go. One more! Darn! Lemons were bad. They cheated on me. The world became a bad place. What happened? Are you alright? Did they do something to you? Is it my mother? Where is Salha? The kids! Where is the kids? Salha ran away. With the kids. She went back to her father's house. I said "Don't go, I'm ill". She said "I don't care". Nice that this girl was here. She gave me some water. Maybe this is for the best. At least the kids would be better off. If that lemon business went fine... What are you going to do now Agha? Honestly, I'm completely broke now. I do not know! What is it? A gold necklace, from my father. I hid it from my brother. Please take it, sell it. I cannot. We do not have anything else to do. You can buy me one later. You can. This is not my jacket. Has anybody seen my jacket? Did you see my jacket? This is not mine! Jacket! My money is missing too. Did anybody see my jacket? Brother, did you see it? My jacket? My money is stolen too. Aunt, did you see my jacket? My jacket! My jacket! My money! - Aaa! - Agha, what happened? My jacket is stolen. The money is stolen. We are damned. I was washing for the prayer. Godless people! Agha. You are right, agha. No religion, now only value is money. What do you want again? Agha, I know your situation. What is it? Don't be stubborn agha, Give Kiraz back. You are starving. - We are not hungry, Agha takes care of me well. - I see, I see. If you cannot leave Kiraz, I can offer a job in my company. What! What are you talking about! How dare you offer me a job! - Kekeş Salman. - Agha! - Get out of here! - Agha! - You can keep Kiraz Agha. - I kill you! - OK Agha. - You rascal! - Agha! - I'm already crazy enough! - Ok Agha. - I'm going. - OK. - Get out! - I'm going Agha. - Get out of my house! Do not come back again. We live however we want. Starve to death. It's my fault. Starve yourselves. Agha! Agha of my ass. Agha of nothing, agha of vegetables. - Get out! Are you still talking! What are you looking at, pimp? Don't mind him Agha. He is right. I do not think I deserve to be an Agha. I'm worthless. I'm a useless idiot. Don't speak like that Agha. - Whatever I touch breaks down. - Agha. I made you suffer too. - Why should I kill Salman. - Agha, don't! I'd better kill myself. - Get out of my way. - Agha, please do not do it! - ... Agha! Damn! Stupid knife! Even the knifes here is bad. Where did you find the coffee? I borrowed from the neighbor. Mother drank the soup and slept. Thank you my Kiraz. What could I do without you. I could not even kill myself. If you die... Kiraz, it will not work out like that. Your place is with your brother. Agha, you still did not understand? I'm not leaving you. - I'm in love with you. Didn't you find some other man to fall in love? There is an agha in every girls heart. Girl, this agha is broken. It's OK. I love the human in you. Maybe that's why you cannot be a good agha. - I'm an agha without a job. - Don't you have any skills? No. I'm an agha. - I have! - What is it? - Çiğ köfte. - OK. Then we sell çiğ köfte. Let's say we decided. Where do we get money for meat and bulgur? We find something to sell. Çiğ köfte. Lahmacun (=some type of pizza). Lahmacun. Çiğ köfte. Anyone wants Çiğ köfte? Lahmacuna. Gentlemen, good çiğ köfte. Lahmacun. Lahmacun.
