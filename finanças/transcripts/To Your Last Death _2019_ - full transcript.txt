Lock the bets. Ma'am...? He killed them! He killed my family! He killed them all! The vast void between stars... empty. Cold. Lifeless. Yet somewhere out there... a game has begun. Poor Miriam DeKalb. Survivor of a horror so dark and deep, it ripped her world to shreds. About to find out that the only path back to the light... may be to go even deeper into the abyss. So... you're alleging that your estranged father... Cyrus DeKalb... He... he called us all together. Collin... Kelsy... Ethan. To... to kill us. You realize of course that some people might consider your story a bit farfetched. He is... he's twisted. Twisted? He abused all of us growing up. He kills people for a living. t's what DeKalb Industries does. They design new ways to kill people then sell it to the government. So why did you go there? Her baby brother is gone. Killed in his crib. Her parents gone as well. And Nafisa can't sew anymore, because... because she's missing both of her arms. Ms. DeKalb, we appreciate the efforts of your organization, but WorldReach isn't in the lobbying business. But you're in the business of protecting children... Frankly, Ms. DeKalb, If you want to make a difference, I suggest you talk to your father. Doesn't DeKalb Industries make the damn drones? Oh. Hey. How'd it go? I'll live to fight another day. That good, huh? Well, Corinne's on hold for you. I'll take it in my office. Corinne! Hi! Just got back from New York. Lots of developments. I think this will be the year we... No, I know there are a lot of deserving non-profits out there... Please, Corinne, I wish you'd... Oh! Jesus Christ. Yes? Okay, you don't look especially happy. Corinne just bailed on us. Oh. So the trophy wife got bored with the cause? She was half our budget last year. Layoffs? We have a few weeks. Too bad you can't hit up you-know-who. I'd sooner slash my own throat. Did you see the announcement? His new scholarship fund? The what? Today, billionaire industrialist and former vice presidential candidate Cyrus DeKalb, whose own children sank the Roberts/DeKalb presidential bid five years ago, announced the opening of the new DeKalb Pavilion at the USLA School of Business, Along with a $70 million scholarship for underprivileged students. You've got to be shitting me. I'm proud to be part of this, to help enable children of low-income families to become tomorrow's leaders. Okay... Okay, okay. He just called me. The bastard just called me. What the hell did he want? I... haven't listened to the message. Hi, sorry I'm a bit early... Whoa. Hold on to your ass, girl. I can't believe he called us all together or some bullshit family reunion. I'm not going. I can't. , if he's really on his way out, this might be your last chance... Are you fucking kidding me? I've told you some of the things he did. Yeah, I think you told the world. but... think of what that could mean for your non-profit. Take his money and then use it against him. I mean, a massive peace initiative... inadvertently funded by everyone's favorite war profiteer Cyrus DeKalb. That's a beautiful thing. Through that door: the arena of your deepest fears. Gut clenched tight... the voice in your head sounding dire warnings. last chance to turn back, Miriam. Let me. Um... hi, guys. Sup, big sis? Miriam. Kelsy. I left... a bunch of messages. Are you okay? I know. I'm fine. Not... doing that anymore? No. Let me see. - What? No. - Let me see. Miriam, if you start with me... For once, would you mind your own goddamn business? Kel, I'm... Um. You okay? You know, guys, I would have really appreciated a return phone call when I wanted to talk about... well, this. Hey, congrats. Um... I downloaded your single. Thanks. We open for Meth Takes a Holiday next week. If you have time. Sure. Sounds great. I'll be there. How is Jerry? Fine. What did you guys do for... Miriam, relax. There's nothing to fix here, and none of us is especially comfortable with this situation. Let's just get this over with. Cell phones and all electronics, please. There are trade secrets in this building. Greetings, everyone. It's been too long. I missed you, Daddy. I'm sure. Please, make yourselves at home. Eat. Drink. But don't be too merry. Alright, then. I must say I'm really pleased that all of you could make it. Miriam, I believe I've met one of your, er, former donors. Corinne? Lovely lady. We're just trying to make conversation. Ethan, I hear Ms. Sheinbaum is going back to teaching. I guess she's gotten over her trauma. I'm outta here, old man. Wait. Forgive me. That was uncalled for. There's a lot at stake here. A lot of money. Kelsy, speaking of money, I think Henry will be very upset when you get home. I just took a deal away from him right under his nose. Collin... With all due respect, Cyrus, we're not here to play games. What is this about? All right, then. let's cut the forced congeniality. Yeah, 'cause our tribe is usually really big on that. I have an inoperable brain tumor. It's called... Glioblastoma Multiforme. I've got maybe six months. We need to discuss my legacy. If it weren't for my dear children, my legacy certainly would be different. For starters, I'd be running this country. "I coulda been a contender." It would be somewhat of an understatement to say that all of you have been disappointments. My brood. The loony, the epileptic homo, the auto-erotic asphyxiator, and the whore. What are you doing? Pronouncing your sentences. Ethan. I could understand wanting to screw Ms. Sheinbaum. She was one MILFy bit of tail. But what the hell was that choking shit? Plain old fucking not good enough for you? Your sentence: death. Are you fucking nuts?! You fucking psycho! Cut the shit right now, Cyrus. Collin. Tried so hard to follow in my footsteps, but of course that was impossible. As if epilepsy isn't bad enough, you had to embarrass me in front of my political contributors with your appalling sexuality. And then, like all the others, you turned on me. Fucking turned! On me! Your sentence: death. Ah! Okay. You... you've had your little tasteless joke... You, we'll get to last, Miriam. I can't wait to discuss the little matter of my public humiliation that you coordinated. Now, Kelsy... Trophy whore. Your husband has been a competitor of mine for years, and you go and marry him? What idiot marries a guy more than twice her age? Living the life of a trophy wife while drowning yourself in pain killers. 25 a day, I calculate, based on the 5 doctors you're kiting. You're a washout. All this just to annoy me. You're scaring her! Your sentence: death. And now you. My dear Miriam... Ah! Your sentence: death. Such pretty eyes. Like my Bethany. Wanna see? Agh! AAAAAAGH! None of you had spoken to your father in years, correct? Since this... In the interest of our nation, we can't keep quiet any longer. Our father Cyrus DeKalb is a narcissist and a sociopath. If he is elected Vice President, this country will experience an elevator ride straight to hell while he lines his pockets every step of the way. You know what's interesting? Your siblings were doing a lot better than you. So? Here's my problem. We didn't find any dead merc in the elevator shaft. That can't be. I spoke with your father. He confirms parts of your story. He did call everyone together... then you sprang a trap... with the help of two mercenaries named Jurek Klar and Aengus O'Callahan. No way. No way! You can't possibly... It was him! I swear I'm telling the truth! Ms. DeKalb. I have to take into account the incident from a few years ago. I was... that was... I'm totally fine now. It was because I grew up in that hell hole. Three months in Del Rey Psychiatric Hospital. Your doctor noted persistent visions of... Your father as some sort of demon. I have to ask: Is all of this part of your vendetta? I want a lawyer. Now! You know what I want? A bagel. I'm gonna take a little walk down to the cafeteria. While I'm gone, perhaps you might reconsider your statement, Ms. DeKalb. Revise a few things maybe. Why? Why is this happening to me? Looks like I arrived at just the right time. Are you... my lawyer? Do I look like a lawyer? Yes. One way or another, I'd say you need all the help you can get. I just need the cops to believe me. Crying isn't going to help. Let's face it, if this was a horse race... you probably wouldn't even make the long shot list. Your father would be the 10-to-1 favorite and nobody would bet on you. Why are you being so mean to me? Not mean, realistic. Hoping to generate some fighting spirit in you. For a rematch. What? With your father. Run the same race that you ran last night... again. Are you fucking nuts? I'd rather die. Like your brothers and sister. Not the attitude I was hoping for. What if you knew then what you know now? You're insane. And that is why you are nothing and your father rules the world. What the fuck does that mean? Life is a game. Aren't you tired of losing? Aren't you tired of always losing? Hey! Anybody! Yeah? This lady is harassing me. Uh... The detective will be back soon, lady. Oh, God! Who sees me and who doesn't... is my choice. I'm not insane. Who the hell are you? You're assuming I'm a who. What the hell did you just do to me? That's a temporal morpheme. A time warp rune. It will dissolve in about two hours. You have that long to decide if you want to be dealt back in. We'll warp you back 24 hours, and the game will begin again. Only this time, the odds will be even. Because you'll have and edge. You'll have... foreknowledge. To activate it, you just trace the morpheme with your finger. I don't understand. This is crazy! I have faith in you, Miriam. That's one of the many reasons we selected you. So... the rules. Rule number one: You must and will provide amusement. Rule number two: My associates can stop the game or ask for a replay at any time. But the final call is mine. Rule number three: I may interfere at my own discretion keep the game interesting, but I don't take sides. Remember... All outcomes are possible. ROAAAAARRRR! What the hell happened?! Stop her! Arrest her! You're only making it worse, lady. Miriam? Everything okay? Freakish much? We need to get out of here. Um... We need to leave. Now! We just got here. Okay... I know you guys aren't going to believe this, but... we are going to die. Okay, Miriam. I have to ask... are you off your meds? No, listen! It's Cyrus. He... Cell phones and all electronics, please. There are trade secrets in this building. Okay, everyone. We're leaving. You don't understand! He wants to kill us! He's going to... he has... And you know this how? Please, please listen to me! Look, I'll explain later, I am walking out that door right and you guys must follow me. Cuckoo, cuckoo. What the... The building locks at 8PM. Please. Come with me. We can call you a doctor. Stop! You've got to listen to me! No! Greetings, everyone. You fucking son of a bitch! Get the hell offa me! Not the reaction I anticipated. Let me go! You're not my prisoner, dear. You can leave at any time. After you hear me out. Okay, here's the deal. He called us here to kill us. There are death traps in there for every one of us. I've seen it happen. Miri, relax, you also saw the four horsemen and Slappy the Magic Chicken. Ethan, your sister is clearly not feeling well. Please refrain from acting like an asshole. Did you know that growing up, I thought my name was Asshole? It would have been if we had done the Indian thing. You know, naming someone for how they act. Prancing Moose, Sitting Duck, whatever. It's Native American, dear. I think we all got off at the wrong foot here. Why don't we start again? Enough! Listen up. He's going to tell us he's got a brain tumor. Multiform Blasto-something. She's right? Go on, tell 'em. Dad. Glioblastoma Multiforme. The reason for my headaches, as it turns out. Inoperable. So yes, I'm dying. I've got six months maybe. Wow. Did you call my doctor, Miriam? Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry. Could they be wrong? No, don't worry, sweetie, they couldn't. You're making it sound like all I care about is money. My dear, of all of us, you're the one who's the least money-obsessed. Living the life... ...of a trophy wife while downing yourself in pain killers. Everyone! This is what's gonna happen, okay? His muscle here are going to haul us away. And he's going to watch us die. Miriam... Want to know what he has in store for you? Remember your little comment to News National about dad's handling of the state budget? Like a magician who saws a lady in half but has no idea how to put her back together? All right, that's quite enough, young lady. You're not gonna get us this time. "This time"? He asked us here because he wants payback. If it hadn't been for us, he'd be Vice President. The power behind the throne. We took that from him. is his final fatherly fuck you. I think it's time you left. Agh! Pavel, please make sure she receives medical treatment she needs. Sorry you won't be joining us this evening, dear. Don't... Don't listen to him! Please! I'm telling you the truth! Well. Can't say I'm not upset. Sorry, Daddy. If you all don't mind... I feel the need to freshen up. Aengus and Jurek here will take care of you. Yo, what the fuck?! Agh! My darling daughter. How? It's that twerpy IT fag you dated. Right? You got him to hack in? No matter. Not everything was in the design document. So, my dear, what we have here is your common, garden-variety elevator. Remember that little remark of yours? About me taking the country on an elevator ride straight to Hell? Turns out a 3-ton elevator car can be a very effective weapon. This one in particular. And forgive me this momentary lack of class, but I must: You screwed me. So, screw you. Such pretty eyes. Like my Bethany. Wanna see? Agh! AAAAAAGH! Ah! Shit! Feeling better? Seriously, what's up with Miri? Pretty crazy shit she was saying. We're having her checked out. She's exhibiting signs of a psychotic break. Paranoia, hallucinations. - Considering her history... - Which is why you shouldn't even think about making her your executor. Thank you for not being a damn phony, Collin. Avarice is strength. Your'e the only person in this family who understands that. Oh, my God! Where's your sister? Popping some pills. Ethan. What? I'm not exposing trade secrets here. Never an iota of gratitude for my damage control. Like you give a crap about me. It was about protecting your career. Yes, my legacy... About that... What the fuck?! AAAAAAAH! No! No! AAAAGH! What the hell was that? That's not how it happened. That's not the way it happened! Foul! And where do you see a foul? She had way too much time to get out of the elevator and... The timeline shifted. Last time around, her siblings were first, then her. Now her foreknowledge has gotten her thrown into the trap much earlier. Can we really expect the elevator to be in the same position? And she's leaving the arena! I guess we all know whom you didn't bet on. I want a ruling! And they don't even wear those until 2153. Gamemaster? Game continues. She's not leaving the arena. Look at the clock. I gotta get out of here. And leave your siblings? I'll call the cops as soon as I'm out. Do you want to know what'll happen if you smash that door in? Not again. Not again! Help! Let me go! Do you really think that's a good idea? Look at the clock. I paused the game. But as soon as the tick-tock starts again, Your siblings are as good as dead. How do I know you're telling the truth? You used to bottle-feed Ethan. And braid Kelsy's hair. Who are you? You promised your Mom you'd look after them. You've seen what'll happen in this scenario. There is only one way for your siblings to survive this, and that's for you to go back up there and save them. The clock will start ticking again soon as you enter the arena. Bitch! Shit! Miriam, help me! Let me out! Aengus! Where is girl? You lost one of the girls? No. I mean... She was right in front, but now... You see nobody? Nobody's been here but you. You're sure she came this way? Where else could she go? I don't know, friend. Weren't you the one chasing her? You stay. I go to old man. Why doesn't he just kill them quickly and be done with it? Fun. I just wanna get paid and go home. Sloppy! How did this happen? Pavel? Pavel! Shit. We find her. Damn right you will. Aengus, find fucking Pavel... ...and get after Miriam. You see to the kids. Start with Kelsy. No more fuck-ups! Lock everything down. And lock everything down! And I mean everything! Breathe. Shit. No... please... Ah, my sweetie. Daddy. Please. I'm sorry. And what exactly are you sorry for, my dear? Whatever you want me to be sorry for. As you know, I'm a bit of a fan of medieval gadgets. This particular contraption that you're sitting on is of my own design. Much like yourself, it wasn't born perfect, I had so many opportunities iron out its flaws in Abu Ghraib. Sometimes I wished I had the same opportunities with you. Now, if you notice, your arms are completely free. That metal tray mounted in front of you is attached to a scale, which in turn is connected to a timer. I never understood this bizarre affectation. Cutting yourself. Pain is something to be dispensed to others. but since you seem to enjoy it... I'm giving you a chance to revel in it. When Jurek starts the timer, you'll have 60 seconds to fill the tray with 10 ml of blood. The scale will register, and the blade will not slice off your head. The timer will then reset, and you'll have 60 more seconds to add another 10 ml to the tray. Daddy! Oh, sweetie. You sound so plaintive. You can lose almost 500 ml before you even feel faint. In theory, you could stay alive for hours. Jurek. 60 seconds has begun. Now, cut yourself. Keep cutting and cutting and cutting. Don't ever stop! No! Fuck this! No! Fuck! No! Please! Boring! Come on. Seriously, I was hoping for a good fight. The sister's too much fun... We should keep her around. Untapped potential. Explosive potential. Replay! Replay! Replay! Replay! Replay! Replay! Replay! Replay! Aengus, find fucking Pavel. You see to the kids. Start with Kelsy. No more fuck-ups! Kill Collin first. On second thought, start with my oldest. What the...? I've done this. Miriam! Okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm getting you out of here. I think we're good here. He's totally cut us off. Still no sign of Pavel. I've looked everywhere. Apparently not. Fucking find him! This building will be swarming with people come Monday morning. Oh! They're fucking it up. What?! Aengus! Okay, I think the coast is clear. We need to get Collin and Ethan, and then we need to leave. I'm leaving now. Collin and Ethan... We can call the cops once we're outside. They'll be dead by then. And you know this how? I just saved your life! Why can't you trust me? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. Kel, what are... Don't fucking call me that. What is your problem? You are my problem. You're a fucking control freak who always thinks she knows better. You can never give people what they need. You give them what you think they should have. When I called you the night before I got married... scared, not wanting to go through with it... you gave me a lecture. About how I need to see a shrink and work through my issues since clearly I'm marrying my father... What did you want me to say? I wanted you to say, "I love you. You don't need this guy." You know what this is? No, not what you think. is is for my Loresta injections. I inject myself every night. That way I'm totally out of it when my "husband" rapes the DeKalb empire. Yeah, that's what my marriage is about. Fucking Cyrus. Hurting Cyrus. Destroying Cyrus. I'm his fucking stand-in. Oh, my God. I'm so... Whatever. Kelsy? Let me out of here or I swear you will regret the day you were born, old man. Time to test your theory. Let's see if I can saw someone to pieces and put them back together again. Dad... please... no. For every question you get wrong, Jurek will remove a limb. Let's begin. Whatever he is paying you, I'll double it. Will you make sex? What?! Sure, yes, yes, I will. Dog. What is an unconventional monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy when standard monetary policy becomes ineffective? Quantitative easing. How do you calculate trailing P/E ratio? Divide the recent price of the stock by the last 12 months of actual earnings. What is... EBITDA? Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and... amortization. Surprise. Return... on... shareholder's equity? Well, I'm impressed. Jurek, cut him in half. But I answered all of your... No. No! Nooo! Dumb little girl. Agh! Ugh! No! Please! The show's over, Houdini. Bitch! Jurek, finish her! Back the fuck off. Stop! Ax against saw. Who will win? Ax lose. You scared? I like scared. See, it is your father not understand. I have power. You are nothing. I can do what I want. Hurt, kill, fuck. My choice. I am God. Yes, that is it. Scream. Scream for Jurek. What the fuck?! Aaah! Aengus? Report. I'm on it, sir. I'll deal with the boy now. Want to hear story? First real mission in the army. 1998. I am 18. We go to rebel village. Donje Prekaz. Some fighting. Easy. My commander say to me, "Come, I teach you." He tell me bring a man into empty house. He asks man questions about rebellion. Man say he do not know anything. My commander beat him. Man talks. Talk so much, I worry we forget. So I write down everything man say. Man is silent. No more talk. Commander shoot him. I show my commander, look, I say, I write everything down. All man said. Commander laughs and laughs and laughs. I confuse. "Why are you laughing?" Commander says torture not about information, torture about power. I learn. Your father enjoy from far. I enjoy close. We play game I like. Miriam! Thank God. We need to go. Do you know how to get out? We need to get Ethan first. Right. Got the trunk from your dorm room. Appalling. Do you use them on others or you like them being used on you? Dad, what is this shit? Since you were far busier doing your 8th grade math teacher than 8th grade math... I was thinking perhaps a little test is in order. Factors! Yay! I want some ROI for the dough I spent on your "education." This is fucked up! Recognize that feeling? I know you love it so. The collar is connected to the ePad. of course, you'll have to use your tongue to key in the answers. Hope that won't be a problem. Besides 35 and 1, what is one factor of 35? Terrific! Remember your divisibility rules? Is 52,462 divisible by 4? Type Y for Yes and N for No. Oh, come on. This isn't going to be fun at all if you're flunking on Question 2. Add all the numbers together, if the sum is divisible by four, then the answer is yes. Personally, I've always hated touchscreens. But you kids seem to love them, so... That is correct! Kelsy! Where did you go? We can't get out. Elevators don't work, and the staircase is off. - Shit. - Wait. But that's not... - That can't be. - Not what? how you and psycho dad planned it? okay, seriously, what is going on? It's the only thing that makes sense. She's in on it. What's going on is that we need to get Ethan and then... You have been acting weird this entire time. Like you knew what was coming. How could you possibly know that? Fine! I'm not insane. But I've been here before and everybody died and I got out. Then somebody or something sent me back, alright? To save everyone. It was supposed to be the same... except everything's changed! Whatever. Do what you want. I'm getting Ethan. You're welcome! Bob purchases lunch for his friends. He buys two submarine sandwiches. One sandwich is 16 inches long and the other sandwich is 12 inches long. He wants to cut servings of the same length from both sandwiches, without having any sandwich left over. What is the greatest length serving Bob can cut? No. Ethan! Oh, my God! It's six! Six! The hell it is! Correct! So one of my kids paid attention in school. Jurek, Aengus, move! Get them! What the...? This is a fire door! You don't chain a fire door! I won. Do you hear me? I won. I played your game. You kept changing the damn rules, but I still crossed that finish line first. See? They're still alive. He failed; I succeeded. Now let us the hell out of here! Jurek! Aengus! Check the west side fire stairs. Check the west side fire stairs. Ow. Fucking trapped. I don't believe this shit! We're in this together... you, with your sanctimonious "It's all okay, we're family" attitude. you now what, Miriam? It's not okay. Nothing is okay. one moment of unity five years ago does not make us a family. I'm sorry. You've "seen all this before." What do we do now? We are way off-script here. They keep moving the goddamn goalposts. Let me see the syringe. Why? You can kill someone with an air embolism, right? Help! Let me out of here! Please, somebody help me! Miriam! Collin! Oh! Did your family serve you to wolf? thinking wolf will be less hungry? What are you doing? No sense of fun. Go. We don't... I say go. Do not come in again. The boss said... We are hired to hurt. To have fun. Out. Help! Yes. More. Music. Somebody help me! Don't shoot! Aengus, right? Listen to me. can make you a very wealthy man. As soon as you're dead, I'm on a plane home, to my wife and son, with enough money to retire. Forget that. I'm talking partnership. I want you to make scream. Scream for Jurek. Now stop. Say, "Please, Jurek." Say it! Please, Jurek. That is right. You do not want to upset Jurek. Say, "Sorry I upset you, Jurek." Aaah! Scream for Jur... Sorry I upset you, Jurek. I can't believe I let you do that to me! You're fucking crazy! Shh! There's still one more. Now the odds are even. Bitch. Wow, Ethan. We need to talk. We're taking over this company. We could use a man like you... for special projects. How much? Two bucks, chump. Drop it. Now! Okay, let's chain him up... Die, motherfucker! Ugh! Die! Die! Whoa. Dude. Do you know how to use it? Point and click, right? I had problems with that... before. See? Easy. Great. Jurek! Aengus! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Oooh! Get to the chopper! Get to the chopper! The DeKalb family... trapped in a nightmare of their own making, struggling to survive as the playing d undulates beneath their feet. A petri dish of mutually assured destruction. We're still fuckin' trapped. Cyrus has the elevator key. Into the lion's den then. We go to see daddy dearest. Look. I just want to say... I know I can be... difficult. And act like I'm sitting on a very high horse... Amen to that. I know how I can come off... I just always want to try so hard to make it all good. You know, the shit we went through... to make it not matter. It matters. It won't ever not matter. It's part of who we are. I'm sorry... for... It's okay. I love you guys. I know we haven't been to each other... what we should have been. But... when we get out of here... I would really like things to be different. Because I... I could really use a family. You know, someone to cook dried-out turkey with on Thanksgiving and exchange lousy presents on Christmas. I don't eat meat anymore. I make a halfway-decent raisin walnut stuffing. No, you don't. Here. I'm not really, like, into, like firearms and stuff. You're in a death metal band. See, that is exactly the kind of misconception that society puts on us. Take it! Seems to suit you. It's down here, next to the conference room. The elevator key. But first, a proposition. We decline. Where are you? You fucking bitch! Language, please. Screaming might not be the best idea. There are people hunting you. I won. We killed him. I'm sorry, but that ending is... anticlimactic. Save your energy. You'll need it. Time to run. Kelsy? I said run. What are you doing? Back-stabbing bitch! You really need to run when I tell you to. What did you do? I told you the rules. I may intervene at any time in the interest of a more satisfying game. Remember rule number one? Be amusing. It's down here, next to the conference room. Congratulations, Miriam. You've won. Of course, you had an unfair advantage, since you already knew what was going to happen. What's going on? The IT twerp your sister is dating hacked into my computer and got the design document for this little adventure. Sis, is that true? No. Oh, please. How else could she know what would happen? They'd never believe him. Different timestream. This... Never happened? Never happened. There was no unification. There was just a truce. We're still fuckin' trapped. Cyrus has the elevator key. Into the lion's den then. We go to see daddy dearest. And then you don't want to see any of them ever again. And then I don't want to see any of you ever again. And I want a fuckin' gun. Here. Fine. Game continues. You knew! You knew and you still let us come here? What? No! Why don't you fill them in on the rest of the design document? Stop it, Cyrus! All of a sudden, everything makes sense. Your crazy act, having been through this before, I thought you were frickin' losing it again. But you were just milking it for cover. Mirii, you didn't, like, just let us walk into this nightmare, did you? That's bullshit! You can't... I knew it. Fuckin' knew it. She set us up. You see, in my design document, it's winner-takes-all proposition... my entire estate. No one was really in danger. It was a test of wills and loyalty. anway, your sister cooked the books. Bribed my assistants. My God, can't you see what he's doing? You knew! You said so yourself. You couldn't have picked up the goddamn phone? Bitch! Fuck! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Enough! Give us the elevator key. All right. You're welcome to leave. Or... you can have what you've always dreamed of. Kelsy, you can be free of the bastard you're married to. Heck, you can hire an army of lawyers and tie him up in court for years to come and destroy his business in the process. Ethan, think what all of these millions could do for your music career. Collin, as head of this firm, you'll have what you've always wanted... complete control. And free sharks. And in return? Tick tock, tick tock. All alone now. End of the line, bitch! Guys, stop! Please! Ugh! Oh! Miriam! Oh, my God. Walt? What?! Oh, my God. Are you okay? No! What are you doing here? How did you get in? Freight elevator. All the other elevators are out of order. It's a bit, you know... stupid. I know how freaked out you were because of this meeting with your father. So I called... a few times... and when you didn't answer, I had this really weird vibe. So I came here... Do you have your phone? Uh, sure. So I came here to... What the hell is that? Where's the freight elevator? Um, I think it's... no, wait... Come here. Miriam, what is going... Shh! What are you doing here? I told you... Are you real? What? It's crazy. That you're here. How did you even get in? Uh, through the loading dock. Miriam, what the hell is going on? And you got in here after we've been trying all night to get out. Okay, this is really messed up. Obviously, you need help. We'd better get out of here. Look at me. Focus. We can do this. We're not gonna give up, okay? Oh my God! I didn't mean to... Nooo! Gotcha. Kelsy! Please don't! I am done being everyone's punching bag. From now on, I'm the one doing the punching. No! Kelsy! Kelsy! No! I'm here! Come and get me! I'm done! You hear me? I am done! Probably not the smartest thing to do. Oh! Oh, my God. I thought we had agreed on not giving up. Oh, don't worry. I'm fine. ct, Walt never actually existed. What? He was needed to give you the final push to come here. Without him, no game. And when you refused to play the game curled up in that hallway, Walt came in handy... again. Time to run. Fuck you. Kelsy's dead. I killed her. I had to kill our sister. I'm sure that's what you'll say about all of us... that you had to. Collin... Oh God! Collin! Ethan, please stop! Drop it, bitch. Oh God. Ethan? Miri... Ethan! No! You like close, Jurek? Is this close enough for you? So. I played your game. Did I provide you with amusement? The wagering was... acceptable. But you haven't won yet. Get going. On my way. ETA 90 seconds. Hi there... old man. That's what Ethan used to call you. He's dead. Or did you prefer "Psycho Dad"? Kelsy's dead, too. Ah! They're all fucking dead. That leaves you as my only heir. I don't want anything from you! No. Of course you don't, my poor sweetheart. You can't. Because there's nothing to get, and deep down... you know it. You've been having difficulties... mentally. Think about it. This entire scenario. You stopped taking your meds weeks ago, Miriam. I spoke to your doctor. She also told me you've been walking a tightrope between reality and fantasy. And that rope is fraying. Bullshit! You've built me into this... this monster in your mind. None of this is real. At this moment, you're laying in a hospital bed. In restraints. None of this is real... Hey, it's okay. Everything is fine. Another bad dream? They're dead. They're all dead. That one again? It's just a dream. I don't think we need these right now. Do you? Good. Because you have visitors. Hey, looking good, sis. But... Okay, so I've got a big announcement to make. I've finally decided: it'll be law school. Oh, please, by tomorrow she'll be back to theater arts. What's happening? We talked to the doctor. He said maybe you can come home for Thanksgiving. You don't eat meat anymore. Why wouldn't I? And she makes a decent raisin walnut stuffing. She? Makes a decent raisin walnut stuffing? This isn't real, is it? Bring me back. Bring me back! You're no fun. Agh! No! Aaah! Real enough, bitch. Real enough. Game, set, match. Happy about your handiwork? We simply piggyback our games on events already in motion. We don't create things. That being said... nice work. Who the hell are you? You can call me... the Gamemaster. Poor Miriam DeKalb... lone surviving member of the DeKalb family... Now keenly aware that the vast void between the stars isn't empty... ...and when it comes to family squabbles, it's better to... bury the hatchet. Well, that was certainly an interesting one. I must say, good call to warp back after they shot the old man. This ending was a lot more satisfying. I thought it was exciting how she had to kill her siblings. All right. Let's tally it up... The odds for the girl to win: 19 to 1. Perhaps someone won a lot of credits today. Ladies and gentlemen, reveal, please. So, we all know whom I didn't bet on, do we? Well-played. Well-played indeed. Now who do we have up next? You're still here. No doubt hoping I'd tell you it was all a fever dream, an hallucination. That the game isn't rigged... and it will all be okay. Sorry... but Hell is empty... and the devils... are here.
