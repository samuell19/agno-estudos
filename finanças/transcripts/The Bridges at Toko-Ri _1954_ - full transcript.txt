Jet launch has been canceled. Clear both catapults. Two flights returning. Expect to recover aircraft in 10 minutes. Stand by with fire bottle for helicopter turnup. Shake a leg, Forney. There're two flights coming in. We're here, ain't we? Keep your jumper on, sir. And Mike, don't put that hat on till you clear the deck. Captain Parker doesn't like it. Very well, sir. Prepare to launch helicopter. Top off all jets and check fly one for ordinance load. Launch helicopter. My hat and scarf, please. Can't you wait till we get off the ship? What if the Captain had seen you? We don't save captains, Nestor. We save pilots. When they're down there in the icy water with only minutes to live, it makes them feel awful good to look up here and see this green hat. I know that, but I'm telling you, Mike, you're gonna get yourself in trouble. And another thing, you gotta quit sassin' them officers like you just did. When are you gonna learn, Nestor? You can say anything you like to 'em as long as you put "sir" on the end of it. Take 215 and 207 down the deck edge elevator. Prepare to respot aircraft for recovery. We've got two flights of jets to land and they're low on fuel. Look alive. Stand by to land jets. Clear the catwalks, port side aft. Check number six wire. The center fiddle bridge is down. Let's hear the checks, boy. Wheels down. Wheels down. Flaps down. Flaps down. Hook down. Hook down. All down, sir. All down. Clear deck. Clear deck. Come on, Commander. Keep your nose up so your hook will catch. That's it. Good boy. Two-zero-two, number three wire. Did real good. Clear the catwalk aft. Two-one-one to Bluejay. Two-one-one to Bluejay. Flameout. Flameout. CIC is reporting an emergency, sir. Go ahead, CIC. Two-one-one reports a flameout. Will have to ditch. We'll dispatch helicopter. What's his position? Eighteen miles out. Is there another jet with him? Affirmative. Two-one-zero is wingman. Can he ditch near the destroyers? Negative. Very well. Keep me advised. Aye, aye, sir. Have you got a fix on their position? Affirmative. How much fuel has the wingman got? Twelve hundred pounds. Angel from Bluejay. Your vector three-four-five, magnetic. Two-one-one will have to ditch 18 miles out. I say again. Your vector three-four-five, magnetic. Bluejay out. Bluejay from Angel. Roger. Two-one-zero from Bluejay. Helicopter on way. What is the condition of two-one-one? Over. Two-one-zero to Bluejay. Two-one-one is losing altitude rapidly and is all set to ditch. Two-one-zero to Bluejay. There he goes. Two-one-one just ditched. Aircraft sank immediately. Pilot got out. Dye marker is visible. Downed pilot afloat. Have him in sight. I'm staying here. CIC to flag plot. Two-one-zero requests permission to stay with downed pilot. Permission granted. Who is the pilot in the water? Brubaker, sir. Brubaker? Just an hour ago a dispatch came in. His wife and two kids are waiting for him in Tokyo. He doesn't even know it yet. Keep me advised on Brubaker. Aye, aye, sir. Brubaker, huh? You know him? I don't think I've ever seen him. But I bet I can describe him. About 30, well-built, good-looking boy with a bit of a temper. That's Brubaker all right. Did you ever notice the pilots the Admiral takes special interest in always look like that? Now that you mention it, yeah. That's what the Admiral's son, George, would have looked like. CIC to flag bridge. Two-one-zero has sighted helicopter approaching. Tell two-one-zero to return as quickly as possible. We can't hold this course much longer. Aye, aye, sir. Angel from two-one-zero. Come on, Forney. I can't hold him in sight much longer. Two-one-zero from Angel. I see him. Go on home. Dinner's waitin'. Roger. If you have to jump in after him, I'll wait around until the hornet sends one of its copters. He looks froze. I'll have to go down. Sorry you have to ride in the rumble, sir. But I haven't got anybody here to haul you inside. Savo Angel to Bluejay. Two angels coming home with two frozen mackerel. Admiral. Go ahead. Helicopter reports Brubaker aboard, sir. The hornet's helicopter picked up Forney's crewman. Good. The helicopter will land in three minutes. Turn right 90 degrees. Aye, aye, sir. Round Table, this is Jehovah. Turn right. Zero, three, five. Stand by. Execute. I wish you could see this, Lieutenant. Awful pretty sight. You know, sir, it looks like they're coming to meet us. Land the two helicopters aft and stand by with a stretcher. Keep clear of those rotors. Clear a passage for that stretcher. How are you feeling, boy? Oh, he's all right. The water's pretty cold, isn't it? It's not bad, not when you're used to it like he is. Oh, Doctor, he's much too young for brandy. You weren't in the water. I know, but I had the hatch open. It's awful cold in there. Hello, Harry. You don't look so bad. How's it going? Hi, CAG. Well, I didn't know water could get so cold without being ice. Feel like talking to the Admiral? Now? No, no. He says whenever you feel up to it. He just wants to chat with you. The doctor thinks you'll be fine by tonight. Okay, I'll send for a uniform. No, you don't have to dress. The Admiral says just come up in your robe. See you later, Harry. Right. I believe the Admiral wants to see me. I'm Lieutenant Brubaker. Yes, sir. He's in his cabin. I'll tell him you're here. From the world-famous Chez Paree in Chicago, overlooking beautiful lake Michigan, the Armed Forces Radio Service is bringing you the music of Henry Busse and his orchestra. This way, Lieutenant. Come in. You sent for me, sir? Yes, come in, son. Coffee? No, thank you, sir. Sit down. How do you feel? I guess I'm thawed out by now. I got the report on your ditching. How long did it stay afloat? After the first bounce, sir, I was a submarine. Didn't have time to get your life raft out, huh? It hooked on the seat. I was lucky just to get myself out. Well, those helicopter boys are pretty good fishermen. As far as I'm concerned, they deserve every medal in the book. You're out there all by yourself. You know you can't last very long. You're scared and you're freezing. You curse and you pray. Then suddenly you see that Mixmaster whirling at you out of nowhere. And you look up and there's Forney and his green hat. Then you relax 'cause you know you got it knocked. Well, I'm mighty glad they pulled you out, son. We can use you around here. Coming from you, Admiral, I appreciate that. Oh, I mean it. You fly well. You go in low and you do your job. You'd have a great future in the Navy. Why don't you make it your career? You know what I think of the Navy, sir. Still bitter, hmm? Go ahead, say what you think. I always do. Of course, I've said it a couple of times too often. Well, sir, the organized reserves were drawing pay, but they weren't called up. I was completely inactive and yet I was. I had to give up my home, my law practice, everything. Yes, I'm still bitter. Sometimes I'm so bitter I could put on a phony act to the flight surgeon, get a green slip and get myself grounded. Why don't you? That's what I kept asking myself this afternoon when I was bobbing around in that ice water. You do a lot of thinking at a time like that, mostly about your friends who are back home leading perfectly normal lives. I wonder if you were back home whether you wouldn't do the same. It's not a question of indifference. It's a question of distance. They act the way they do because they're there. And you don't quit, and go on doing your job because you're here. It's just as simple as that. Son, whatever progress this world has made, it's always been because of the efforts and the sacrifices of a few. I was one of the few, Admiral, at New Guinea, Leyte, Okinawa. Why does it have to be me again? Nobody ever knows why he gets the dirty job. And this is a dirty job. Militarily, this war is a tragedy. I think we ought to pull out. That's rubbish, son, and you know it. If we did, they'd take Japan, Indochina, the Philippines. Where would you have us make our stand, the Mississippi? All through history, men have had to fight the wrong war in the wrong place, but that's the one they're stuck with. That's why one of these days we'll knock out those bridges at Toko-Ri. Do we have to knock out those particular bridges? Yes, we must. I believe without question some morning, communist generals and commissars will be holding a meeting to discuss the future of the war. A messenger will run in and tell them, "They've knocked out even the bridges at Toko-Ri." That little mission will convince them that we'll never stop, never weaken in our purpose. And that's the day they'll quit. But I didn't call you here to discuss strategy, Brubaker. I'm supposed to chew you out because of your wife. My wife? You knew she was in Japan. She made it. I hope she's got the kids with her. You better hope you don't get a court-martial. I had nothing to do with it, sir. How did she and the children get here without your help? Her father used to be a senator from Massachusetts. Admiral, I don't care if she's broken a dozen rules to make it. War's no place for women. I'll tell COMNAVFE you had nothing to do with bringing her out here. Thank you, sir. When we get ashore, I'd like to meet your wife. It'll be a pleasure. Why don't you see if the surgeon can spare you a nightcap? I'll do that, sir. Give you a good night's sleep. In three days, you'll be in Japan. No more worries about takeoffs for a while. No, sir. But it's gonna be a long three days. Group one, idle. Group two, idle. Group one, full throttle. Group three, full. Come in. CAG wants to see you, Admiral. Hmm? Lee, Commander of the air group, is here. Oh, send him in. Wait a minute. What do you think of Lee? He's a good man, popular. The pilots all swear by him. I got a letter from a friend in the personnel office. They're looking for someone for higher command training. They want my confidential opinion of Lee. Send him in. Group one, full throttle. Admiral, I received a dispatch this morning from COMFAIRJAP. It said that the replacement aircraft requested for the next tour are not available. Yes, I saw it. Well, all we'll have is what's aboard this minute. The captain's burning up the engines. Have you talked to the captain about it? I tried to, but he wouldn't see me. I don't wonder. He's a little busy berthing the ship. Well, if he keeps doing it this way, sir, we won't have any propeller planes left. How would you berth a carrier against the wind, Commander? I'd anchor in the stream before I'd run a lash-down engine at top speed. That's not fair to the pilots who have to fly them, sir. You know as well as I do that the Pinwheel Operation is necessary in this harbor. There's no room to get a tug between the dock and the ship. Those planes are the only thing that can hold us off. For the last 100 yards, yes. But he's been running those engines from the moment we hit the channel. Do you consider a few engines more valuable than a carrier? No, sir, but they've only got so many good hours. Burn them up on deck... How long have you been in the Navy, Lee? Twenty years, sir. Twenty years. You're the commander of the air group. What would you think of one of your pilots if he went over your head and came to me? You know the task force commander doesn't interfere with the running of any ship. Yes, sir. But under extraordinary circumstances such as these, I feel... You're coming up for promotion, Lee. Don't you realize that Captain Parker will have to turn in a fitness report on you? Yes, sir. Suppose I did talk to the Captain. What kind of a fitness report do you think he'd give you then? I guess I was only looking at it from my point of view, sir. I was just thinking of what was best for my pilots. Next time, think twice. Yes, sir. I will. There are two things I don't like to see a young officer do. The first is going over somebody's head. But once he does, I hate to see him back down so quickly from something he believes is right. He'll be all right for some jobs, but as far as higher command goes... And I'll have to tell him so. Uniform of the day for liberty is dress blue. Liberty will expire on board at 0700. Looking for your wife, sir? Yeah. There she is. Mrs. Brubaker. You know, sir, I've got the same kind of reception waiting for me outside the gates. You married? Not yet. But I may be after this leave. Liberty party fall in. Muster on the flight deck for inspection. Lower away. Easy. All right, men. Open up. Hey, Beer Barrel, what's your handicap? I only have two hands, junior. That's my handicap. Can't lift those beer mugs fast enough. Hey, Beer Barrel, you need a caddy? You bet. After the first nine steins, they get pretty heavy. Oh, darling. Darling. Where are the kids? It was too long of a trip for them. How long is your leave? A week. Are the kids okay? Oh, they're fine. I found a wonderful Japanese nurse. Come on, darling. They're dying to see you. Have your liberty cards ready. Have your liberty cards ready. There she is, Nestor. Hey, Kimiko. Your man's back! Not so fast, big boy. Things are different. We got to talk. All right, let's find some cozy little nook where we can... Talk. Daddy, Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! Kathy, Susie. We saw you getting out of the car. You did, huh? They've gotten so big. This is Setsuko, Daddy. How are you? Have they been good? Oh, yes. Come on, come on! I'm coming. I'm coming. Thank you. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Yes, Kathy? Come here, I want to show you the fish pond. Uh, Kathy, take your sweater off, dear, and put it away in the closet and see that Susie does too. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. Yes, honey? I want to show you the funny bed I sleep in. Okay, young lady. You show me. Why don't you leave me alone? When I'm standing out there with those paddles in my hands, I have enough to worry about, you guys. When I get ashore, I don't want to worry about anything. One thing does worry me, though. Have they got enough beer in Japan? Good evening, boys. Good evening, Admiral. Brubaker, how's the family? Oh, fine, thank you, sir. Uh, Admiral, this is Mrs. Brubaker, Nancy. How do you do? I thought your husband was going to take off like a jet when he heard you were here, Mrs. Brubaker, and now I understand why. Why thank you, Admiral. I was kind of pleased to see him too. Won't you sit down, sir? Thanks. Well, they didn't keep you in Tokyo too long. No, they don't anymore. Not since that first press conference. I told them we were fighting Russian guns, Russian radar, Russian planes and Russian submarines. A lot of our men are being killed by Russian equipment manned by Russian experts. Ever since then, they bundle me out here as fast as possible. I'm Lieutenant Brubaker. A gentleman to see you, sir. Oh. Excuse me. Will you have a drink? Doctor won't let me. What is it, Nestor? Mike's been in a terrible fight, Lieutenant. Just Mike? No, sir. But I got away. Mike's in jail, sir, in Tokyo. I came out as quick as I could. What happened? His girl's marrying a boatswain from the Essex. Oh, it was bad, sir. If you don't come, he'll be locked up permanent. Nestor, Tokyo's 60 miles away. I'll phone the MPs right... Callin' won't help, sir. Mike clobbered two MPs along with the gang from the Essex. What did you two do, take on the whole town? Yes, sir... Practically. Nestor, I'd like to do something, but... Oh, please, Lieutenant. You gotta help Mike. Okay, I'll come. You wait here. Excuse me, Admiral. Hon, there's been some trouble in Tokyo... Oh, Harry. What kind of trouble? Uh, it's Mike Forney again, sir. Uh-oh. A girl, another sailor, a brawl, the usual consequences. He's in jail. Oh, Harry, you don't have to get mixed up with brawling sailors. Darling, if Forney were in China, I'd have to help him. Harry. If you were freezing to death in the sea and a man brought his helicopter right over your head and rescued you, wouldn't you help that man if he got in trouble? Did Harry crash at sea? Yes, four days ago. You know your husband's at war, but... Somehow you just can't believe that he'd crash into the sea. Hasn't Harry told you anything about what he's been doing? He never talks about the war. With the rest of them, he's been doing a tough job and doing it well. But when we go back to sea, he's got a tough one ahead of him. He's going to have to fly against some... Certain bridges. Ask him to tell you about them, Nancy. I don't even want to think about it. I suppose to you that's a sign of weakness, isn't it? Maybe not weakness. But like most people at home, you've been protected. You're ignorant and defenseless. Harry doesn't want me to worry. That's the way my son, George, felt. Harry often reminds me of him. Same quick temper and the same thorough way of doing things. As a matter of fact, in certain ways you remind me a little of George's wife. She didn't want to think about it either, is that it? When George was killed at Midway, she never recovered. For a while, she tried to make love with every man in uniform. Thought he might die one day. Then she grew to loathe herself and attempted suicide. I don't know where she is now or what she's doing. Once, she was my... My son's wife. And you think if things go wrong at those bridges, I might be like that? Perhaps... If you don't let yourself think about certain things. If you refuse to acknowledge what you're up against, terrible consequences can follow. I shouldn't have come out here. That's what you're trying to tell me, is it? No. In spite of all the regulations, maybe you were right to come. Perhaps when George was killed, if my wife had come out to join me things might have been different. But she stayed at home like a good navy wife. Then when our other boy was killed trying to torpedo a Japanese carrier, it was just too much for her. You lost two sons and your wife? No, Margaret's still alive, but all that was gentle and loving about her slowly withered away. Now she sits quietly alone in her room, knitting a baby's sweater. Oh, Admiral, I'm so ashamed. Don't be. Just be grateful for what you have. And above all, be honest with yourself. If I can't face the reality now, then there won't be much hope for me afterward... If anything should happen. I have a feeling you'll be all right. Let's get your little girls and have dinner. Come on, Nestor. Major, I'm Lieutenant Brubaker. You've got a chief here by the name of Forney. He's off our ship, the Savo Island. I'd like to get him out. I wish I could help you, Lieutenant, but your wild Irishman just wrecked the dance hall. Well, he also saved the lives of four pilots. Look, Lieutenant, I got a lot of monsters back there in that birdcage. Every one of them was a hero in Korea. But here in Tokyo, they're all monsters. Well, Forney's a helicopter pilot. The other day I had to ditch my plane at sea. These two men saved my life. As a matter of fact, this man here jumped into the ocean... And I suppose his face got chopped up that way by the waves. Well, I know there was a brawl... A brawl? Lieutenant, a brawl is when maybe six guys get to throwing punches, but these two monsters took on half of Tokyo. Well... You married, Major? Yes. Well, we just got in at noon today. I haven't seen my wife or kids for over a year. I left them at Fuji-san and came all the way up here to get Mike out of jail. That's what I think of these two men. Well, I... You willing to cough up 80 bucks for the damage he did? I'd pay $800 if I had to. Okay, Sergeant, drag Forney out here. Sign here. He's yours, but you're not getting any bargain. I knew you could do it, Lieutenant. Thanks, Major. Come on. Oh, Lieutenant. Don't let him get away from you. There are parts of Tokyo comparatively unharmed yet. Look, Lieutenant... You two are going back to Yokosuka. You gotta come with me. You gotta talk to Kimiko. She can't marry that ape from the Essex. Look, Mike, I'm not... Sure, you are. She'll listen to you, Lieutenant. Please just do me this one favor. All right, where is she? Follow me, sir. Pardon me, sir, but you're not supposed to be in here. It's all right, son. He's with me. Lieutenant, there she is. Kimiko, uh, this is Lieutenant Brubaker. Ah. I wondered whether any girl warranted a riot. I guess you do. Thank you, Lieutenant. He wants to talk to you. I'm very sorry, Lieutenant, but while Mike at sea, I lose my heart to Essex man. Essex not at sea. But Mike's a fine man. You couldn't do better than Mike. I know. Mike good man. But I lose my heart, Lieutenant. Not in my dress, you don't! I'm gonna... You don't want to cause any more... Lieutenant, she took me through too much pain! Leave me alone! Come on now. Hey, Mike. What is it, you... Hey, what's going on over there? Break it up. Break it up. What's going on here? I guess you'll live. Kimiko. Here, Lieutenant. Don't worry, sir. I'll get him back. Kimiko. Come on, we're going back to the ship. That's my girl. Kimiko. I'm sorry, darling. It's all right. Did you get him out of jail? Yes, I got him out. Admiral Tarrant told me about Mike Forney. I wish he hadn't. Don't worry. I've had it now. No one ever crashes twice. Harry, what are the bridges you have to bomb when you go back? Tell me about the bridges, darling. You know, I think Kathy and Susie ought to have piano lessons when they get to be a little bit older. It's funny, I was thinking the same thing just the other day. I always wanted to learn. Never got around to it. Same here. They say if you start young enough... They got new methods now. It doesn't take as long. I know. Mildred Porter learned in just a few months. Even after four or five weeks... Harry, you've got to tell me about those bridges! The bridges span a narrow gap between two mountains. It's one of the most important targets in all of Korea. Consequently, it's fortified accordingly. Although we're only over the target about 30 seconds, it's a lifetime. Every kind of gun imaginable is hidden in those mountainsides. The men behind those guns know where we're coming from and where we're headed. They know we're not going to fly above the mountains. We're gonna fly between them. We're coming in low and straight. There's no room to twist or duck. And there's no surprising them. They're just sitting there, waiting for us, hoping we'll come. That's Toko-Ri, Nancy. I'm glad you told me. Does it help? I think so. You didn't want to tell me because you didn't want me to worry. Well, I don't want you to worry either. About me, I mean. I know what the Admiral was trying to tell me. I had to face those bridges too. Well, I have. And I'll be all right now. I'm gonna swim all the way across the pool. So am I. Harry, I'm not so sure about this. Oh, don't be silly, Nancy. Now, you ladies go in there and I'll go in here. Harry, you get in the pool first. We're not coming out until I know the coast is clear. Okay, you modest violets. Why does the water taste so funny? Because it's mineral water, Kathy. It comes right out of the spring. Watch me swim, Daddy. Okay. That's fine, Kathy, fine. Harry, are you sure that door is locked? Absolutely. Watch me swim too, Daddy. - Watch me swim. - Okay, Susie. Hey, hey, this is private. This is private. We had it reserved. No, private, reserved. Number one. Good morning. No, no, no. You don't understand. We had it reserved. The whole pool is reserved. No, no! Harry, do something! What can I do? Take a deep breath. Ohayo. Ohayo. Ohayo. Ohayo. That means "good morning" in Japanese. Belong you? Yes. Belong me. Keiko, Takako. I'm Kathy. I'm Susie. Happy family. Yes, happy family. And this is Tilly. She picks up aircraft and gets them off the deck if they lose a wheel or something. Why do they call her Tilly? Why do they call you Nancy? The ship will get under way in 45 minutes. Visitors are requested to be off the ship in 15 minutes. Now hear this. The officer of the deck is shifting his watch to the bridge. Here comes Beer Barrel. What was your score, Beer Barrel? Don't drop your putter. Hey, what's par for the course, Beer Barrel? Pull your flaps up, boy. You sure are overloaded. Report my return aboard, sir. Report my return aboard, sir. Get refueled, Beer Barrel. Report my return aboard, sir. Can I help you with those, sir? Thanks, sonny, but this is a man's work. We've got a few minutes yet. That's Mike Forney. Green scarf? Yeah. I never knew there was so many beautiful girls. There ain't. We cornered the market. Best thing ever happened to you, Mike... Losing Kimiko to that big ape from the Essex. Nestor, you're a wise man. There she is, girls, the Savo. The greatest flattop in the fleet. What's called this ship? Oh, that. That's the Essex. Not here, Mike. There's too much brass and SPs. You're right. She ain't worth it. What's one girl? The flower of Japan. The pride of the fleet, my lad. The best man won. Thank you. Bless you, my children. Hey, come on, Forney's at it again. Hey, look, Chico's in the fight. You take a swing at me and I'll flatten you. Kill that little shrimp. That's the guy that started it. Hey, give me a hand. Hey, who do you think you're hitting? I'm from the Essex, too! Hey, get back. Get back. This ain't no place for a lady. Hey, what's going on here? Come on, back to the ship. Come on, come on, come on fellas. Let's go. Come on, boys. Get back to the ship. And that's the man you spent half the night getting out of jail? Yes, and I'd do it again. Although we're going out to get new pictures of the target area, this flak intelligence photo will give you some idea how rough this mission is going to be. In order to determine the tactical approach, I'll fly the mission to get the pre-strike photos. Brubaker, you'll fly cover for me. Roger. We'll come in from the west. You stay at least 3,000 feet above me at all times. But keep away from even altitudes. It makes it tougher on the gunners. We'll take off in an hour. All right, Martin. You've got it. Boy, what a spot to take pictures. When I go, I want bombs, not cameras. All cameras ready on photographic plane. Clear port and starboard catwalks forward. Prepare to launch photographic mission. Launch jets. Bluejay, this is Peter Peter 21. My feet are dry. Crossing first checkpoint. There's our second checkpoint. Town of Majon-ni. Just passed Yangdok. Target 15 miles ahead. Remember, CAG, all you got is a camera. Get in and get out. I'm only gonna take their pictures, but watch how mad they get. Commencing run. I've seen it rough, CAG, but that was the roughest. You all right? I think so. I felt something that could've been a hit. My tail hook position light came on. Drop down, look me over. Nothing visible. Good. Mission completed. Returning to carrier. Real estate sure looks better on the way home. Stand by to land jet aircraft. Wheels down. Wheels down. Flaps down. Flaps down. Hook down. Hook down. All down, sir. All down. Clear deck. Clear deck. Clear deck. Land aircraft. Nice goin', CAG. Roger pass! Clear the deck! Stand by to rig a new barricade. I'm all right. I'm all right. Bluejay to two-zero-niner. Follow deck. Peter Peter 21 crashed. He's okay. What is your state? Fuel critical. Only 650 pounds remaining. Barrier being repaired. Estimate 10 minute delay. I'll be out of fuel by then. How about the hornet? Hornet not spotted for recovery. Orbit ship. Roger. Get that barrier cleared and that plane out of there. Man Tilly! Barricade is not repairable. Tilly will be used to protect planes forward. I've only got 450 pounds left. How about it? I don't want to go into the sea again. Position Tilly in the number three barrier spot. On the double! Impossible to repair barrier in time. Must use Tilly to protect planes forward. The deck is pitching badly. Do you wish to attempt deck landing or do you wish to ditch? I'll come aboard. Pri-Fly says if he doesn't make it the first time, he'll have to ditch. He hasn't got enough fuel for another pass. I'll bring him in if Tilly doesn't bother him. Stand by. All personnel clear the deck aft and at the base of the island. Stand by with crash equipment. Bring me in, Beer Barrel. No wave-off. Come on, junior. I know the deck's dancin', but you gotta make it this time. All planes aboard. Continue clearing barrier. Strike Peter Peter 21 below as soon as possible. Commence refueling. The smoking lamp is out throughout the ship. Maybe you'd better not fly for a few days. I'm all right, thanks. This is all I needed. What are they doin'? Movin' you, Doc? They're not moving me. We're sending some medical supplies to the destroyer. She's coming alongside to pick up Forney and Gamidge. Forney and Gamidge? Haven't you heard? The Captain's having them transferred. They're going to the helicopter scow at Yodo Island. So long, Gamidge. Good luck. Thanks, same to you, sir. Watch out, Nestor. Don't get your feet wet. You're liable to catch cold! So long, Lieutenant. We'll send you the 80 bucks. Good luck, Nestor. They want us to fly our eggbeater in behind enemy lines three times a day after meals. I don't mind rough duty, though. I really hate them commies! Take care of yourself, Mike. The pilots need men like you. Thank you, sir. Well, Lieutenant, if you ever have to ditch around Wonsan Harbor, we'll be there to fish you out again. What's the matter, Lieutenant? You look kinda edgy. You know what I used to do when I got jittery? I used to walk out to the forward end of that flight deck, and let that spray hit me right in the kisser. Used to fix me up every time. All right, Forney. Let's go. Right. Why don't you try it sometime, Lieutenant? The two stone bridges offer the best targets, but you'll also have to hit the low ones. We'll give you your coordinates and checkpoints at the final briefing tomorrow afternoon. Now, your secondary target will be this fuel dump at Tok-tong. We've hit this before, of course, but there's evidence of new activity in the area. Are there any questions? Yes. About Toko-Ri. Where would you say is the heaviest concentration of flak? Here are the shots from my wing camera. Does that answer your question? The flight will consist of three divisions. We'll make our approach from the west, and we'll attack three times if necessary. Martin, you'll take your four jets in to suppress flak. I'll follow with my division on the western bridges. Brubaker, your division will take the two bridges to the east. Roy, you'll be the last man down. You'll give a damage report after each attack. Takeoff will be at 1500, so when we go in, we'll have the sun at our backs. Any questions? A warm, sunny day at the Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles. The temperature in the high eighties and you oughta see this sight! Eighty thousand fans are sure getting the thrill of their lives this afternoon. This is the big one. The Rams trail the 49ers by six points and the winner meets Cleveland for the title. Now the Rams line up again. The ends are split wide. Van Brocklin is dropping back to pass. He gets good protection. It's a long, long one to Fears. He's dropped on the six-yard line. First and goal to go. "Dear Nancy. "These will probably be "the last words "you'll ever receive from me." "Dear Nancy. "I wish I could tell you how wonderful it was to see you. "I'll never forget the picture of you "standing there on the dock "as we came in." What are you doing, Harry? Why, I was just writing a letter to Nancy. I can't sleep with all this racket going on. Yeah, I noticed that too. It always seems louder just before you're going out on a mission. You all right? Yeah. Look, Harry, this is an important mission, very important. We've got to do a first-rate, professional job. I can't afford to take chances. I know. If a guy comes clean and grounds himself, I'm grateful. But if he tries to bluff it out and endangers an entire mission, that's unforgivable. Think it over, Harry. Pilots man planes. Pilots man planes. Stand by to start jet engines. Launch jets. Flight from CAG. Target dead ahead. Prepare to attack. Two-zero-five to CAG. Commencing flak suppression run. Two-one-two from zero-zero. This is two-one-two. Damage report follows. Three bridges down. One railway bridge intact. Are you sure, Roy? It looked like direct hits on all of them. Negative. Stand by for second attack. CAG to flight. Commencing second attack. All bridges down. All bridges down. Nice going, CAG. CAG to flight. Rendezvous and proceed to secondary target. CAG to flight. Secondary target below. Commencing first run. Two-one-zero from two-zero-niner. I think I just took a hit. Two-one-zero! Two-one-zero from two-zero-niner. Just took a hit. Where are you? Harry, this is CAG. Two-one-zero must have radio failure. I have you in sight. I'll be with you in a minute. No visible damage. A little vapor coming from your fuselage. Could it be hydraulic fluid or fuel? RPM's surging a little bit. Everything else seems okay. CAG to two-zero-five. Martin, take over. I'm staying with Brubaker. CAG from two-zero-five. Roger. Will stay above and keep you in sight. Thanks, CAG. I was worried there for a minute. Thought I might have to land here. I think I'll make it all right. Brubaker from CAG. What state? Fuel okay. Two thousand pounds. Keep checking, Harry. You're losing fuel. Hydraulic fluid would be gone by now. Can you still see vapor trail? Affirmative. Don't your gauges show it? Can't tell. You'll make it to the sea all right. Wonsan Harbor's just over the ridge. If you can make the helicopter scow, they'll pick you up. Yeah, sure, I'll make it. I'm losing fuel fast now, CAG. Down to 1,600 pounds. You'd better call the word now, Harry. You better call the scow. Yeah. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is two-zero-niner. RDF call. Thirty-five miles northwest Wonsan. Flak damage. Losing fuel rapidly. Let's go, Nestor. Alligator One to two-zero-niner. Give me a call for a bearing. Emergency! Emergency! Prepare helicopter for launch. One, two, three, four, four, three... Launch helicopter. Bluejay! Bluejay! This is Alligator One. Alligator One, this is Bluejay. Go ahead. Two-zero-niner has had an emergency. He bears 330 degrees 35 miles from Wonsan. Air Op, CIC. We have an emergency. Stand by to write. Can't last much longer, CAG. You're doing fine, Harry. You'll make it. Fuel tank's empty. I've had it. I still think you can make it, Harry. I've got enough altitude to glide to the water if I can only clear the ridge. Can't make it. What are you gonna do, Harry? Crash. They love to fire at parachutes. Alligator One, this is zero-zero. Two-zero-niner crash landing, bearing 335 degrees. Twenty-five miles from Yodo Island. Roger your transmission. Trying to divert propellered aircraft to the crash for RESCAP protection of downed pilot. There's a clearing ahead looks pretty good. I see it. Looks like an irrigation ditch along the side. That's right. Try to land near it. If you can get out fast, make for that ditch. Be sure and hit every item on your check-off list, Harry. I'm doing that now. Tighten your shoulder straps as tight as you can stand them. I can hardly breathe. Gun? I've got one. Not that I've ever used it. The other division's coming in above us. How does the field look, Harry? You pick 'em real good, CAG. Jettison your canopy. Get out fast, Harry. No matter what happens, get out fast! Forney! Nestor! Nestor! Nestor. And they was gonna give Nestor a medal too. How much longer can them ADs stay? Not very long. They must be running out of ammunition. They won't send over another copter now, not after dark. If we can hold out through the night, they'll find us in the morning. Here, you better take this. You know how to fire a carbine, sir? Just release the safety there and squeeze the trigger. It fires automatic automatically till you stop firing. I'm a lawyer from Denver, Colorado, Mike. I probably can't hit a thing. Judas! How'd you ever get out here in a smelly ditch in Korea? That's just what I've been asking myself. Better get these things off, too good a target. The wrong war in the wrong place, and that's the one you're stuck with. What'd you say, Lieutenant? Did you ever hear Admiral Tarrant go on about this war? About the chosen few who have to lay it on the line? Uh, Nestor and me never done much fraternizin' with admirals. I can see now he was right. You fight simply because you're here. Watch out, Lieutenant! Where's Lee? He's waiting on the bridge, sir. Admiral from CIC. Go ahead. Just received final report, sir, authenticated by Army Intelligence. Jet aircraft crashed. Helicopter shot down. Three Americans killed by communist troops. Why was Brubaker abandoned? Admiral, we kept a RESCAP over him as long as we could. One helicopter crashed, why didn't you call in another? I called in the downed pilot condition report before I was forced to leave. My fuel was low. The first helicopter hadn't even arrived. There was nothing more that I could do. Was Brubaker hit at the bridges? No, sir, at our secondary target. We got the bridges. We still had bombs left so we went to work on the fuel dump. Was that good judgment? Admiral, this was a good mission. We did everything just right. I put Brubaker in charge of the third division because I knew he would fly low and bore in with the bombs. He did just that. I don't care what kind of a fitness report you give me. This was a good mission. It cost the lives of three men, Forney, Gamidge and Brubaker. I know how you feel. But what makes you think you're the only one? He may have been your boy, Admiral, but he was my boy too! I lost him. You're right, CAG. You're right. I was wrong about CAG, Evans. He's a good man. Good man. I'd like to write Brubaker's wife, but what can you say? How do you explain this to the mother of two little girls? Prepare to launch jets. Where do we get such men? They leave this ship and they do their job. Then they must find this speck lost somewhere on the sea. When they find it, they have to land on its pitching deck. Where do we get such men? Launch jets!
