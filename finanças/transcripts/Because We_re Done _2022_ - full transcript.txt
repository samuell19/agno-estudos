Why you rushed out of here so quick? Oh, I'm headed to Woodland Hills to surprise Evan. Now, why would you do that? You know he don't like surprises. Girl, ain't nobody listening to him. I'm like, "Look, To heck with it, I'mma be with my husband," okay? What is he doing in Woodland Hills? Oh. Girl, he's got this seminar for the next two days out there, so he got an Airbnb so he wouldn't have to make that drive, but little does he know I know where the Airbnb is. And I'm on my way there to relax him. And child, he need it. 'Cause for the past few weeks, brother been working on sister's nerves, okay? [laughs] I know it's crazy 'cause it seems like for the past year, things between us been real bizarre. You know, it's like he been on one for, like, a whole year. Same, like, I don't know. But that's all right. 'Cause I'm on a mission to get our marriage back together again. Tonight, I am on a mission, honey, to make him forget every other woman he ever been with, and remember why he married me. Okay, I don't care what they say, you know, little young boys be wanting Meg Stallion, but hunty, in a second, they gon' be like, "Erica Stallion. - Erica!" - [both laugh] I'll be back Tuesday, though. And, um... if things get a little frisky... [chuckles] I'll be back - on Wednesday. - [squeals] [laughter] All right, girl, listen, these people on this road workin' my nerves, so I'll, um... I'll holler at you. After my wonderful experience. Holla! [chuckles] - [sighs] Erica. - [keyboard clacking] First, let me say thank you. [cell phone rings] [dark music] Hey, handsome. How you doing? I'm, um... I'm good. I'm good. Good, good. I just, uh, hope you relaxing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm about to turn on my sports and... And eat some wings and... and do absolutely nothing. Oh! See, that's what I'm talking about, baby. Right there. Okay, and you deserve that, all right? You should do nothing, you know? 'Cause you've worked hard and... And it's time for you to take a break. Mm-hmm. And you need a break for real, though. Yes, I do. And I'm sorry I can't take that break with you, baby, but... you know, I got a little bit busy, and, uh, I'm sorry. I kind of feel like I've been neglecting you. You have neglected me. Ooh, okay. So, I guess that means I deserve a spanking. Yeah. Yep. You sure do. Spanking. Ooh! So, like, are you gon' do a little bit more than that, Daddy? Like, are you gon' tie me up, and handcuff me and pull my hair and choke me until I... I stop being a bad girl? And don't do those things anymore? Tie you up, choke you, handcuff you? No. No, no, no. I ain't trying to put you in a hospital. [clicks tongue] Listen, I'm... I'm gon' chill, eat my wings, watch some sports and... and... And chill for a little bit, so I'll... I'll call you tomorrow. All right, baby, you... you go ahead and you eat them wings good. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. All right, boo. I'll talk to you later. Yeah. Can't... can't... Can't wait. Love you. Yep. Okay. I'll talk to you later. [sighs] Oh, my... I... I can't do this. I can't do this. [keyboard clacking] [exhales sharply] - [cell phone rings] - Oh, my gosh. Hey. Hey, you. You okay? Yes. Oh, my gosh. Yes, I am now, just to hear your voice. You at the B&B? I am here. Where... Where... where you at? I am feverishly rushing back to the office because Aaron just called as I'm halfway to the car. He wants me to come back in and do some financials for Dr. Chuku's accounts. So, you know how he is, I have to head back. Oh, my gosh. I can't wait to see you. I really can't wait to see. I'm looking forward to seeing you, too. I can't wait for my surprise, babe. So, I should be there as soon as possible. Just give or take the traffic and I will see you then. Ah. All right, see you soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because she don't want me to tie her up and choke her and nothing ridiculous like that. [sultry R&B music] [sighs] Okay. [speaks softly] Okay. Mm-hmm. [chuckles] This is nice. Mm-hmm. Oh, I see that. Okay. [exhales] [cell phone rings] Portia, did you call Evan? 'Cause the house was set up, like, real romantic-like, like he knew I was coming. And you know what? You always spoiling my surprises. Oh! I didn't tell him anything. Uh-uh, don't even try to lie your way out of it again, okay? Because I know you hate it when he's surprised and you don't like to see us argue. You always got to tell him every time I'm about to surprise him. But you know what? Actually, I'm cool with it, though. [moans] Yes, girl. I am cool with this, this time. Oh, yeah, it's about to be lit up in this piece. - Ya mean? - [both laugh] Okay. All right, it's cool, girl. I got to go. Talk to you later. Bye. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, yeah. Feet is fitting to blow my back out. [exhales, whispers] So, I need to stretch. Help me, Jesus. [groans] It popped. Mm-hmm. Yup, yup. It popped... [sultry R&B music] Mm, mm, mm. Look at my baby. He's so sexy when he's sleeping. [clears throat] [blows air] Mm-mm. [whistles] Okay. [whistles loudly] [record scratch] [gasps] Oh! Baby, you okay? You... - [both gasp and scream] - Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, honey. [Evan] What the hell! Why you scream like that? - Huh? - Why did you hit me? I hit you 'cause you screamed like that. What's wrong with you, trying to scare somebody? Aw, boo-boo. Mumma sorry. - Okay. - I'm so sorry. All right, all right, Erica, Erica, what are you doing here? How did you even know I was at... How did you even get in the house? Wait, wait, wait. [laughs] Oh. [clears throat] This my sexy walk. [laughs] Okay, wait for it. Hold on. I'mma get it. It's my girl, baby. She made this. [indistinct] [laughs, clears throat] Bam! I'm ready for my spanking, Daddy. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ain't no spankings today. What are you doing here? How'd you even know where I was at? Don't pretend like Portia didn't go calling and blabbing all the business about me coming. I know she told you. Hmm. [moans] Mm, you smell so good. Okay. All right. [clears throat] [chuckles] Ready for my spanking, Daddy. Ow! Okay, Erica, I... I asked you not to call me Daddy. - It... it don't feel... - What? Comfortable for me. - Come on, baby. - Come on. Here. Here. Can you just... - I took it off for a reason. - Yeah, I know, I know. What are you doing here? [sighs] All right, baby, look, I just came to spend some time with you. Come on, now. It's like we've both been through a whole lot lately. We've been really busy, I mean, and things have been a little... [making noise] You feel me? So, I was like, "I'm gonna surprise my boo." I was like, "WTFN." - Why the... - I know what it means, Erica. Okay, you was looking like - you ain't understand. - Uh, okay. All right, all right, Erica. Here, here. Just here... come here for a second. Come here. [sighs] All right. Oh. Oh. Okay, I see you, boo, you wanna do something romantic, right? Before we get into that hardcore boom! [hisses] Yeah, I got you. See, Mr. Wilson. - Come on, Daddy. - Oh. - Come on. Okay, all right. - Erica. I could do the romantic, but first... [gasps] Take me, Daddy. Erica, can you get up, please, and stop calling me "Daddy"? I told you, that don't feel comfortable for me. All right, okay, boo. Well, give it to me, boo-boo. Oh, my gosh. Can you sit up, please, for a second? - [gasps] I need you. - Oh, my gosh. Erica, for real? Oh. Okay, geez. Okay. All right. What? - What is going on? - Where... where's your phone at? Oh, okay, you want to do some freaky-deaky stuff? I'll get freaky for ya. All right. It's downstairs in my purse. [whispers] I'll be right back. I'll be back. [laughs] Ooh. Yeah, my baby want a video. It's gon' be hotter than [indistinct]. Okay, baby, I'm back. I got the phone. Let me see, I got some photo. Got to flip it around. Ooh, hey, cutie. [laughs] I might as well take a selfie. Mm. [laughs] All right, oops. My bad. That's portrait. Okay, here we go. [clears throat] And rolling. Action. I guess you want me to go... - [sings]... downtown. - Wait, wait, whoa! Wait, whoa, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Erica, what is wrong with you? I feel like a piece of meat around a starving dog. Woof. Woof! Woof! - [barks, laughs] - All... Okay. Erica. What in the Coming to America? Erica. Erica. Can you just check your email, please? Check my email for what? Just check your email, please. Okay, but I'm gonna check my email why? Oh, my gosh. Can you just check your email, please? Okay, fine. I'll check my email. I'll just help me help you help me understand why I got to take the energy and the time to go in here and check an email with you standing right there. - Oh, my gosh. Forget it. - It's a lot of energy. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I'mma just say it, okay? No, no, no, no. I will read it if you want me to read it. No, it's... you obviously want me to say it. - So, I'll just say it. - No. I'm gon' read it since you obviously want me to read it. Oh, my frickin' gosh! Do you want me to say or do you want to just read it? Do you want me to read it, or do you want to just say it? [Erica squeals] Wait. You doin' this... All of this right here. See, this is why you need some good, animalistical sex. Okay? Because you're too wound up. You're wound up, man, let me take care of you. [scatting] Okay. Why so serious? You want me to read your email? - Yes. - All right, fine. If it's that important to ya, I'll read the doggone email. Sheesh. [in Russian accent] This is me reading the e-mail. What does my husband have to say? That's my Russian accent. Privet. [laughs] Okay. Go to "Help," put your name in. Okay. [clears throat] "Erica, first, let me say thank you." You're welcome, boo. Won't be coming back? "If you believe our marriage can last... Please don't erase my Sixers games." - What the hell? - I thought I erased that. [exhales] [somber music] You don't think our... Our marriage can last, Evan? No, I just... I don't know, Erica. I just need some time to figure. The truth is, Erica, I don't... I don't need time to figure anything out. I'm going to divorce you. What? I just... I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't want to do it. So, you was gon' tell me all o' this... with some freakin' email? I know. I was like, "Dang, that ain't right." I didn't wanna be arguing with you, so I figured I'd email you. But then I figured I email you, that would be rude, and I didn't want to be rude. I just... I went back and forth myself on this a lot. I really did. I was conflicted. Leaving for Atlanta tonight. What? - Later tonight. - Tonight? By yourself? Don't look down and to the left, E. Answer me. Are you going to Atlanta by yourself? Look, it don't matter who I'm going with. "Look, it don't matter"? "Look, it don't matter"? Is that what you just said to me? It's exactly what I just said. You just repeated it. I repeated it 'cause I can't believe you just let that mess come up at your mouth, talking crazy to me. So, why ask me if I said it if you heard it clear enough to repeat it? You walking with some side piece on me, E? No, no! Don't you dare look down and to the left. I didn't look down and to the left. I look just to the left. Same damn thing. And you know I hate it. Answer me, E. You walking with some side piece? Look, it don't matter. "Look, it don't matter"? It don't matter, really? It does matter, E. Oh, it matters. Okay, who is she? I want to know who she is, and I want to know right now. What's her name? What's her name? I need to know right now. You tell me what it is. Answer me. [huffs] What's her name, E? Ooh, okay. Okay. I see what time it is. I know what time it is. [exhales] - What are you doing? - [Erica groaning] Ooh. I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready to twist a shorty. Get back! That's what I'm doing right now, okay? And she think she going to Atlanta? Oh, with my man. Okay, no, it don't go down like that, homie. It don't go down like that. Not up in this piece it ain't going down like that. She understand what I'm saying? Aight? You know me. You know me, E. Just [indistinct]. All right? Whoo! You ain't going. Mm-mm. This ain't gon' let that happen. Okay. Okay. One question for you. Okay. Okay. Does she know... Does she know that we married? Answer me, E. I really wish you would just call me Evan. Answer me, Evan. [babbling and scatting] Wiki-wiki-wiki-E! Yes, she does. Don't even. [exhales] ooh, I'm about to catch a case. I'm about to catch a case! I'm about to catch a case! Ooh, it's coming now. Ooh! Why do you get like this? You know why I get like this, Evan. Because this is who I am. This is me. No, no, no, no. You stop fronting like you don't know me. All right? You talk about rolling out with some side chick. You gettin' packed to leave with a side chick on me? You asking... [huffs] You asking me for divorce after 15 years? Fifteen years of my life. And you trying to roll out? Uh-uh. Mm-mm. It ain't happening like that, shawty. It ain't going down. So, answer me, huh? What's good, E? What's good? We're done. "We're done." We're done? We ain't done until I say we're done, boy! What the hell wrong with you? Oh, my gosh. Did your side piece come after you, or did you go after her? Do you mean, "other woman"? No. No, I mean side peace. Look, this thing is about you and me. It's not about anyone else but us. No. This is about your side piece. - Your thot. Your little slut. - Oh, my God. Your whore. Your little trick. You know what's your trip, Evan? [exhales] You are such a trip. So, wow, you was just gonna... get on a plane, go to Hotlanta... and just tell me through some email. So, I guess you're in love with this trick, huh? Look, the subject here is you and I. No, the subject here is you and your little side piece. Look, we haven't even been meshing lately. Yeah, but we was working it out, right? You know, I mean, just two weeks ago, feel me? And then you held me. You know what I'm saying? I don't know what you're saying. Two weeks ago, on our date night, you held me in your arms, and you said... I love you. [romantic music] You remember that? I remember. I was lying. You was lying? - I was lying. - You was lying? Why do you repeat everything I say? - Clarity. - You have clarity by repeating the very words I say word for word? - So, you was lying. - Oh, my freaking gosh. Evan, I don't know why you acting like you just met me. You didn't just meet me. This is how I am, man. And how you are is just... Just what? Huh? What, E? Nothing. No, no, please. Please, go ahead, tell me. How am I? Do not look away from me when I'm talking to you. - Ow, ow, ow. - What the hell's wrong with you? Ow, ow! Can you let go of my ear, please? Ooh, I'm really tripping up for you right now, E. I'm really tripping up for you. We were... are friends. Aight? And we talked about everything. We talk about everything. Or at least I thought we did. So, you couldn't... you couldn't come talk to me about this? I'mma tell you what's up, aight? What's up is you ain't going nowhere, until we work this thing out. Because that's what we going to do. We gon' work it out. You understand me? You feel me? All right? Because you are my husband. And I mean that, all right? And you owe me that. It's the least you can do for me. Okay, fine. Fine, Erica. Fine. What do you want to know? Why do you want a divorce? I got to make a phone call. Err? You got to make a phone call? Pssh! You must've bumped your head for real if you think I'm going to... Mmm. You are working my nerves, E. You are really, really working my nerves. Erica, will you give me my phone, please? No. What? Is the little heffer trying to come up over here? Is that what's going on? She on her way over here, E? Oh. Oh, don't tell me you in love with this trick. I'm in love with the woman. Oh, I know you bumped your head, you bumped your head for real. 'Cause you are not in love with anybody but me. You're not in love with her, E. You are in love with me. How you gon' to tell me who I'm in... Can you give me my phone, please? [sighs] - Thank you. - Psych? Ha-ha! No, no, no. In fact, you know what? I'll tell you what I'm gon' to do. I think I'm gon' give Miss Thing a call. How about that? Huh? What's her name? I'm not telling you her name. Okay, 'cause I asked you, like, 50 times already. You ain't gon' tell me. That's fine. I'm sure I can find one of these little ratchet pictures or videos up in here. [gasps] That's all right. I will work it out. - Erica. - Evan. [Erica screams] [quirky music] [Evan] I don't know why you are always playing around. - You give me my... - [Erica muttering] - [Erica screams] - [Evan] Ow! - [Erica] Oh, my God. - [Evan groans] [panting] Evan? Honey. Evan. You okay? Baby, you okay? Evan, stop playing because if you play 'cause you trying to get this phone, it's not gon' work. E. [blows air] All right. Oh, dang, he knocked out for real. This is perfect. [snaps fingers] This is perfect. You know why? 'Cause you belong to me, you understand? You my man. And I'm keeping you. I'll be right back. Don't go away. [groans] What the hell?! Erica! Erica. Oh, my gosh. This woman is... Erica! [mysterious music] Erica... Erica, why am I handcuffed to the damn stove? - Erica? - [Erica humming] Er... Oh, my gosh. Erica! Look, calm down. Let me put this little icepack... I want no ice on my head. - You do need some ice... - I don't want no ice on my head! Hold still... I don't want no ice on my head! Ooh, you so stubborn. My God! And you are so crazy. Why am I handcuffed to the damn stove? Honey, you the one that dove into a concrete wall. Trying to get my phone! Trying to hide your dirty little secrets. Ain't no secrets in my phone, Erica. Oh, yeah. You know, I must say, your text history is really pristine for somebody who was cheating on they wife with they mistress and about to leave. Mm. So, you and Jezebel didn't never have no text messages? Erica, will you uncuff me, please? [gasps] Please tell me, was that true about Tony wanting to get a sex doll to simulate a threesome between him and Diane? So, you and her just really ain't even text each other? - [Evan huffs] - [Erica] Hmm? Okay. You know what? You're not getting your phone back, all right, until you tell me why you want a divorce. - Because, I mean... - You're ghetto, Erica, okay? That's why. You're ghetto. You damn near 50, and you talk like a hood rat from Brooklyn. It... it... it... it's... It's embarrassing. - You think I'm ghetto? - As hell! It ain't even a thought. - And you damn near 50! - [Erica sighs] Do I look like I'm 50? - No. - No? Actually, you look like you about 38, - Yeah. Eh. - 40. But you ain't 38 or 40. You damn near 50! And you supposed to grow out of that type stuff and you just... Okay. And... And that is why you want a divorce? Yes. Listen, Erica. Do you. Be as ghetto as you want to be. I won't be around it anymore. This... I can't even invite you to the damn office party. My job has an office party. Everybody is supposed to bring some nice delicacies for the people to eat. Everybody housewife brings nice, good-old meals. What does my wife show up with? Chicken wings and grits. Who the hell brings chicken wings and grits to a damn office party? It's embarrassing. So, why didn't you say nothing about it then? I did say something, and you said to me, "Stop trippin' and being so snobbish." You have become more snobbish lately. I mean, come on. The E-Dubb that I knew, he would have been so cool with it. It might have been no problem for him. But this... This new E-Dubb, this imposter, I don't know that dude. Who are you? I don't know him, sorry. But the reality is, Erica, I'm not 35-year-old E-Dubb. I'm 50. People grow up. Something you've chosen not to do. Okay, how could you? Like... You know, it's like we had this relationship all these years. Ya mean? And... and... and... and it's like we've been able to... You feel me? But now, here we go with all this. You know what I'm saying? I don't have a clue what you're saying. What the hell are you talking about? This is another thing that drives me crazy. You will never complete a damn sentence. [Erica muttering] I'm saying that I'm Erica. Okay? I'm still me. But you... [blows raspberry] Ever since you got with working with these bourgeoisie... [mumbling] Bourgeoisie what? See, this is what I'm talking about. I'm saying, I am me. This is who I am. This is how I've been. You know how I get when I get riled up or if I'm in an uncomfortable situation. But the truth of the matter is, is that you the one that has changed. Wait, wait, wait. [shoes squeaking] Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you saying that I've changed? You have changed. You're saying I've changed? You are repeating the same words that just came all up out my mouth. Clarity. But here's the deal. Be very real with me. You're saying you have sufficient evidence based on my accent, my characteristics, to say that I've changed? [valley girl accent] Like, oh, my God, for sure. Well, here's the reality, Erica. I have changed. I'm not 35 anymore. I'm 50. People grow up and grow out of their childish ways into their adult ways. I'm an adult male. You're stuck in the damn early 2000s. I am not stuck in the early 2000s, okay? I am stuck in being who I was when you fell in love with me. But you? No, no, you're working with these people and it's... you feel like you've got to have them accept you instead of being true to who you are. Mm-hmm. Mm. I get it, Evan. I get it. Okay? That's where you work. I get that. But do me a favor and actually be true to you, boo. Well, there's the disconnect right there. - Because I am true to who I am. - [scoffs] [chuckling] You're trying to tell me that you truly believe... that you're being true to you? - That's what you saying? - Who I am right now? - [Erica] Mm. Mm. - Yes, I'm 50. This is who I am at this age. [laughs lightly] What's so funny? Oh. The E-Dubb that I knew... [plastic clattering] The one that I fell in love with, the one I'm still in love with, well, he won't change for nobody. E-Dubb was E-Dubb. Periodt. Oh, but you know what? These white people have got all up in your head. They done got to straight tripping, son. It's aight, though. It's aight. It's cool. 'Cause you know what? I'mma get you back, boo. Mm-hmm. I'mma get you back. 'Cause you ain't done, baby boy. Mwah! Got you. So, what are were doing? Y'all gon' bid or what? What, what we doing? What's good? They just nervous, babe, 'cause they know they about to be set! - Ya mean? - [laughter] I don't know why y'all so exciting. - We are winning. - Damn. I don't understand. Winning don't mean won. So, we're down to the last thing right here. Y'all feeling good... y'all was talking a whole bunch of nonsense in the beginning. Let me tell you something. Winners never lose. - Losers never win. - [laughter] - [Evan] Ah. - Oh! Not too shabby. Put the nail in the coffin. Put the nail in the coffin. - Dang, but sometimes in life... - [Erica] Come on. - Before you get to the word... - [laughter] you got to go through the whole trials and tribulations - to get to the word of rejoice. - [man] Runnin' his mouth. So, now I'm about to get to the rejoice! Oh! You can't mess with E-Dubb and Princess E. Mess with my E-Dubb. You mess with my E-Dubb. - It's what we do. - [Erica] Drink ya little drink. You know what? You know what? This is who we are. See, this is who we are, babe. You my E-Dubb. [hip-hop music] Well, I'd like for you to uncuff me. So I can go back to being Evan. Nope. Erica. Nope. Nope. N to the O-P-E. You ain't never gon' get that key. 'Cause you know you belong with me. And until you fall back in love with me, [indistinct]. [laughs] Now that I know what the problem is... Hmm. You know I'm saying? I know how to fix it, boo. Mwah, mwah, mwah. You know you love me. You love me. Okay. [music fades out] What are you doing? I'm making you your favorite meal. Why? Because you need a reminder of how much you love me. Erica, it's not a question of... of loving you. It... it's just... Couples go through stuff, Erica. Marriages go through stuff. They have irreconcilable differences. It just happens. Are you listening to me? Hello? [huffs] What're you makin'? I'm making you your favorite omelet. Your Evan special, boo. Your omelets ain't never been my favorite. Monkey say what? I ain't say nothing. I know the heck you didn't say nothing. [quietly] Your omelets done had me fartin'. Had the whole house stink. One more again. One more again. I'm about to slave in this kitchen for you. You better put some 'spect on it, aight? Well, you ain't got to be waving spatulas at me. You better be glad this all I'm waving at you. Erica, why won't you... Why won't you uncuff me? What... what are you doing? What... Just uncuff me. Why won't you uncuff me? Because I am keeping you here until we work things out. I... I don't want you, Erica. I... I don't understand how that doesn't compute. I don't want to be with you. Oh, my gosh. [quietly] You gon' have me eatin' your arm [indistinct] some toilet paper. That's it. [Evan] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's it. That is... [sultry R&B music] You gon' love it. [Erica exhales] Eat. I love you. I love you with all my heart. But I don't do well being disrespected when it come to my cooking. Aight? So, Father, thank you for this food, and right now in the name of Jesus, I ask that you touch this man, this lying, cheating, whorish spirit that's on him. I ask you to take it up off of him, Father. Okay? Thank you. Amen. All right. [clears throat] Boy, ain't nobody playing with you. Eat. Sitting there looking all special. Ain't got time for that. You know how I know you going through a midlife crisis? 'Cause you haven't been sleeping well lately. And your appetite has just, like, been all over the place. And nothing... I mean, nothing makes you happy. So, it's a midlife crisis, okay? But the cure is... You know, it's... It's like a person with amnesia. It's like, sometimes you got to remind them of the things that they love, so that they can remember who you were and who you are. Now you, baby, you are my beautiful, handsome husband. [sultry R&B music] And I will never forget that you taught me how to love. I can't. You taught me how to believe in it. Because I... I haven't stopped. Because I have been cheated on. And used so much. And lied to. But you, E-Dubb, you was real with it. Man, you was real with it. You were, in a word, a blessing. - I got to pee. - [music cuts out] I got to pee. [glass clinking] What I'm supposed to... [emotional music] [crying] ♪ How the hell am I supposed to do this? How am I supposed to do this? It take two hands to do this. ♪ You do realize you're stayin' here until you want me again. This is crazy, Erica. You're freaking crazy. How am I crazy? Life don't work when you hold somebody hostage 'til they love you again. Who does that? Apparently me. I mean, I'm sure it's been done before, so don't be tripping. By who? Crazy people? No, people who actually fight for they marriage. So, let's talk about this mystery woman... Thot... that you've fallen in "love" with. Does she even... Like, I have no clue if she really even exists. Oh, my... [stutters] Woman, you are trippin'. Listen, woman... Yes? Listen, babe. There's nothing wrong with having a midlife crisis. Really. There's nothing. It's aight. It's what happens when you old. You go through this thing, you just... You know, you feel like you get to have a younger woman. [chuckles] Because you feel old and decrepit. I understand. It's... it's like being a crypt-keeper thing. You just need some attention or something. But it's okay. It's okay because... Oh, I know what's going on. It's like your mind is trippin'. This thing done got you thinking thoughts you usually wouldn't think, like... Do you dream of chocolate-covered rainbows and sexy women in Dubai? Oh, my gosh! Erica, I'm not losing my mind. What are you talking about? You sure about that? Are you sure, boo? All right, fine. Then just tell me who she is, okay? Who is she? [Erica gasps] Oh. Dang! It just hit me. You met her at a strip club, didn't you? That's why you couldn't pay the... the cable and all them bills, 'cause you spending them at the danggone strip club. - Is that what happened? - Really? - Really? You did, didn't you? - Really? Ain't nobody been to no strip club. So, I guess this is what happens with y'all when you get old, you know, you go through this... This... this midlife thing... You are making me late for our plans. Ah. And what plans are those, E? - We're going to Atlanta tonight. - Mm-hmm. Oh, with the stripper? Oh, man. Well, you know, baby, that's cute. That's really cute, but it ain't going to happen. [chuckles sarcastically] Okay. Like, for real. Why are you doing this, Erica? I already told you, boo. Because I love you. You don't love me, Erica. Oh, yes, I do. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. Erica, you started off wanting to be a wife. Now you just don't want to lose your marriage. I can understand you wanting to fight for your marriage. I... I get all that. But the way you're doing it, it makes me want to get as far away from you as possible. Why? Because it makes you look crazy and thirsty. And it ain't cute. Ain't nothing cute about being handcuffed to the damn stove and peeing in a damn thermos. Well, I ain't crazy. But you right, though. I am thirsty. I'm thirsty for us. Thirsty for you, boo. Because I love you and I know you love me. And not some little stank skank mystery thot ho from Magic City. Okay? You love me. Aight, cool. Look, I know I'm flawed. I'm flawed. All right? It's things I need to work on. Like finishing my sentences, which I'll be doing. Yeah, I'm working on it. Ya mean? Baby, I love you and this... This... What we going through? What you going through... Pfft! It's okay. We gon' get through this. All right? But you gon' fall back in love with me, whether you like it or not. E-Dubb. [Erica chuckles] Wow. What? Maybe you're right. No, maybe I am at an age where I was trippin' a little bit. Oh. Trippin' a little bit? [laughs] That's my E-Dubb. Ladies and gentlemen, my baby is coming back. Woo-woo! Like, like, you right. You were my Princess E. And I'm still your Princess E, boo. - Better believe that. - Ah. Ya mean. - Ya... Ah! Ya mean! - [both laugh] So, listen, let's do this right quickly. Now, just to honor what... You know what I'm saying? For everything we been through. Feel me? - Right, right. - Why don't you uncuff me? Ya mean, key over there somewhere. Uncuff me. We go over here, we chop it up for a little bit, figure out how to work this thing out a little bit. Ya mean? Ya mean. That's my E-Dubb. - E-Dubb. - [laughs] No, that ain't gon' happen, boo. What do you mean it ain't gon' happen? It ain't gon' happen. Do you love me and want me again? What you talking about? I do lo... love you. - What you talking about? - Mm. You can't even do that. - I... I... - [Erica blabbering] It's getting bottled up in mouth. That's all it was. I know how to say I love you. - I love you. - You do? You do? Listen, let me tell you something. Be real-real with ya. I'mma keep it real with ya right now. 'Cause I'mma tell you something you ain't even heard in a long time. I love you. - Oh, wow. - See what I'm saying? - Yeah. - So, uncuff your boy, let's go over here, holler for a minute. Ya mean? Chop it up right quick. - Chop it up! - Talk about this thing, figure out how to figure out what we need to figure out. You know what I mean? Out this situation and we can move forward with our lives, real rap. Where... Where... Where... Where the key at, though? [laughs] What you laughin' for? Wow. That was the worst acting job I ever seen in my life. Act... What you talking about? Listen... That was just really bad. - It's terrible. - Listen. See, now you... Now you done went way too far. You think somebody up here trying to win an Oscar or something. Ain't nobody tryna win no Oscar. This ain't no Denzel moment. I'm just trying to be real with just me. - Damn. - Ya mean? If I acting, this is just me being me and I'm always gon' to be real one hundred. One hundred. Feel me? - I feel you, boo. So, I'm saying, baby, as your husband, let's holla about this thing for real. - For real. - [Erica] For real. Get back to what we used to be. Yeah. Do you want me to uncuff you? - Yeah. See, now I... - Aight, aight, baby. Aight. - [handcuffs click] - Psych. Okay. I'll tell you what you gon' need. You need an acting coach. Come on, what you talking about? This... this your boy right here. Ya mean? You and I got history. You know what I'm saying? We need to chop it up 'cause we got problems. I know I was part of problem. I probably created the problem, but you... like you say, you were flawed, too. You know what I'm sayin'? So, you flawed, I'm flawed. Let's go over here and figure how to un-flaw ourselves so we can go back to being just normal loving people. That's all I'm saying. You over here talkin' about somebody tryna win an Oscar or something. I don't even know... I ain't never met Oscar. Just trying to talk to my wife. - So, what's really good? - [doorbell rings] Wait a minute. Could that be the mystery thot right there? - Help! Help! - Nah! Uh, no, no, no... [quirky music] Help! Hey! [muffled screams] [doorbell rings] Mystery? Um, I'm sorry? Is your name Mystery? No, it isn't. Excuse me if I do not invite you in here yet. So, you wait a minute. Denise, huh. Yes, and, um, you are? Erica. Erica Wilson. Evan's wife for life. I ain't no one important. - [chuckles nervously] - Yes, I... - I... I mean, no, I... - Hmm. - You are very important, but... - Mm-hmm. Where's Evan? Oh, poor girl. [chuckles] He is locked up in handcuffs. Mm. I mean literally. Okay? [laughs] They were meant for me, but, you know... you know, sometimes when that roleplaying get a little bit out of control, we got to switch it up a bit. You feel me? - Mm. - [Denise] Mm. Yeah. You know what? All right, girl. Baby girl, let's go chop it up a bit. Okay? Child... You gon' meet me on the side of the house, over in the back, all right? 'Cause I'm sure you very familiar with being on the side of a house. I'll see you in the back. Don't open this door again. [Denise scoffs] You aight? - [Denise] Yeah. - Good. Wow. So you're, like, uh, fine. And young. Instagram thot. Thot? [chuckles] Wow. As in that... That ho over there, yeah. Mm-hmm. No, I am not a thot. People don't even use that term anymore. Yet you knew exactly what I was talking 'bout. I'm just saying, you look like one. No diss, but is that outfit even your size? Is it like two sizes too small? No, no, it's my size. Oh, if you say, boo. So, shout out to you on your conquests, baby girl. Whoo! Whoo! Apparently, you... and my husband are running off together, huh? You should feel proud of yourself. Are you proud? Hmm? [sighs] I didn't mean to. - Yeah, yeah, whatever! Shut up. - Since you and... - [Erica mumbling] - You guys were done. No, no, I'mma tell you... You got it. I'mma tell you how it's about to go down, baby girl. All right? You listen up real good. See, my husband... Let me do a little remix for you. My husband is into the OT, not going to Hotlanta with your trifling ass, okay? All right. No, no. I ain't done. So, you can go back to work at Magic City, and you can find another goofy husband who's going through some midlife crisis. And then you can, you know, hustle up him and his wife can do what she want to do. But this wife right here, if you stick around a little bit longer this ain't what you want, trust and know that, aight? So, why don't you do me a favor? Go and get back in your car, go on up the road and get up out my face. Okay? Excuse me, but I do not work at Magic City. You're not a stripper? I would never strip. Okay, so then where the heck do you work, child? At Frankels, Snell and Brad. [thunder roaring] - With my... - [Denise] Hmm. With my husband? I'm Mr. Frankel's executive assistant. Hold up. [clears throat] At the accounting firm where my husband works? That's it, hmm? Yes. [thunder roaring] Excuse me. I am about to catch a case. - Oh, I am about to catch a case. - Um... I'mma need you to get on up out of Dodge, I'mma need you to roll up out of here. Go up, yonder, be out my face right now. - Just go. Be out. - Okay. Okay. But could you at least have Evan call me? Because our flight is about to leave and I need... Child, get out of my face. - Well, it was nice to... - Go! - Okay, bye. - Don't say another word to me. Bye, bye, bye. Looking like a damn disco ball. What the hell's wrong with you? [exhales] Okay. Are you for real? Are you fucking for real? You were having an affair with some trick at your job? Oh! [grunts] You know it's a trigger for me. And we talked about this multiple times. We talked about it. We had conversations. We said... we said specifically that we would not ever deal with work-related attractions. At the job, we said it. We even had counselling sessions, man. [voice breaks] Nah mean? Damn we... We went to counselling over this. And you know my father left my mother. You knew he left me and my mother for his secretary. You gon' go sleep with you secretary? Are you serious? [grunts] [crying] Oh, my God. How could you... Man, I would have rather you just... Just hook up with somebody from the strip club. I am all right with that. Running those little hos at the strip club instead of you going to... your freaking secretary! Damn you! Ooh, you make me sick right now. [huffs] Oh, my God. You must hate me. You must really hate me to do this to me. I can't stay with you. [father] Hey. Don't touch me. - How could you do this to me? - [sighs] Your secretary? You had that woman in my house. - Get out! - [father] Cheryl. [Cheryl] I want you out of my house now! Mom, no. [Cheryl] I don't want you ever coming back here. Ever! Daddy, no. No. - Daddy, no! - [Cheryl] Baby, hush. [Cheryl] Hush, okay? It's going to be okay. No. [cries] [Evan mumbling] [Evan vocalizing] Why'd you lie to me? How did I lie to you? You never told me you was having an affair. With your secretary. You never told me. You never asked. I never what? I never asked? Is that what you just said to me? I am gonna punch you in your damn face, talking crazy to me like that. Oh. [Erica sighs] If you thought that something was up with our relationship and it was so jacked up, then I would rather have you say it. "Hey, babe. Hey, look, you know, I feel like smashing my secretary. I'm really not feeling you these days." You could've just talked to me, man. I did try to come and talk to you. When? When? When did you come and try to talk to me? - Babe. - Hmm? Can we... can we talk for a minute? I really need to talk to you. Mm. We talk too much. I am really tired. It's been a hell of a long day. - [Evan] Hmm. Hey, babe. - You hungry? - Smells good. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I'm hooking it up for you. Want some hot sauce? - Oh, yeah, sure. - All right. Babe, listen, I really need to talk to you. - You got a minute? - Oh, you know what? I'm actually about to get up out of here. I got to roll, 'cause guess what yo baby got? I got a job doing Sanaa frickin' Lathan's hair, woo-woo! Hey. - Woo-woo! You proud of your boo? - That's really dope. - You're proud of me? - Can we talk? Oh no, baby, listen, I got to hurry up and get to the set, okay? And I will be there all night and check it out. I got this job from a referral from my girl, Gayla. Okay? She hooked me up because Sanaa's hair stylist missed her flight so we could talk tomorrow. I promise, mama love you. Oh, mama love you. Sexy. You look so dang good your suit. Okay, so, um, eat up. I'm sorry I left the fork, but you got it. - I love you. Love you. - Hey, I need to talk... I did try to talk to you, numerous times and you never had time for me. So you don't respect my tough days, but I'm supposed to respect your request at your beck and call. You basically said I did not try to talk to you, and I did. And you would never at my beck and call, so don't even come at me like that. Oh, so you gave up. Yeah, I gave up. What man is going to be chasing his wife around when she won't give him the time he needs? [sighs] Does she listen to you? - This isn't about her. - Yes, it is about her if you 'bout to run off with her. It's about her, boo. Does she listen to you? [whispers] Silence. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay, girl, you... You've made mistakes. You got to own, okay? You're messed up too, E. He's made mistakes. But you're not going to give up, Erica. You are not gonna give up like your momma did. You ain't gon' do that. Aight? [indistinct]. You're not going to be your mommy or daddy. - Daddy, no. - Shh. [exhales deeply] So you gotta... you gotta fight. You gotta fight for this. Because that's your husband. And you've been 15 years and you invested your time and you loved him with all your heart. So, stop. Stop crying. Stop. [sniffs, sighs] Okay. Okay, because you're gonna save your marriage, girl. [breathes deeply] Remember this photo? It's first time we met at the beauty shop. Remember it took you, like, two months to just finally talk to me? Two months and then finally you asked me out. And then we would go and... sit at different places and just talk for like hours. [scoffs] Mm-hmm. Oh. [clears throat] Here we go. Hey, do you remember this? That was when you came to my friend's birthday party. [chuckles] Oh, my God. I remember, it was like, "Man, we had such a great time." You know, we met right under that big, old tree. We just snuck off from the party, and just talked and talked forever. [sighs] And see, that is when you told me how much you loved music. [piano playing] And that's when I came to know about your true passion. Yeah. E-Dubb. [chuckles] [clears throat] And this day, right here. June 23rd, 2014. That was the day that changed my entire life. [Erica chuckling] You know that was the happiest day of my life. It was real with you, you know? And you used to listen to me. You were straight humble. And you treated me like a princess. You really dated me. You made me feel special. This is the day that you was the most sincere I had ever seen you. You asked me to marry you. [laughs] You really got me. You really got me. And I had absolutely no idea. You feel me? Thought I was gonna be that happy. I had absolutely no idea... that I'd be that happy to be your wife. And I was... I was so happy God. When I said our vows, on our wedding day... I meant every single word. I meant every word. I meant I wanted to make you happy. I meant that, boo. On everything. Memories, man. [sniffs] I love you, Evan. I love you with all my heart and all my soul. I have to pee again. [breathes deeply] I gotta pee again. [sighs] [sniffles] [sighing] [clattering] [Erica] Oh, hell. [Erica climbing stairs] [exhaling] [water flushes] And moving on. Let me call her. [phone ringing] [cell phone ringing] Evan, what is going on? I'll explain later. Where are you? I'm on the side of the road. Started going home and then I decided I'm going to come back and fight. Then I realized if I was gonna fight, I was probably going to lose and... I don't know, I just... I didn't want to mess up my hair. I just got this outfit. - So I just pulled over and I'm... - All right, but where are you? I'm halfway between there and home. Okay. Are you packed? No. I was supposed to come and meet you, remember? We're supposed to have a beautiful evening before going to the airport. Then we're supposed to go back to my house, so I could pack. But then, your wife shows up, and I don't even know what I'm supposed to do about that. - All right, all right. - You didn't even tell me. Um, I am packed, actually. We got a couple of hours before our flight leaves, so we got a little bit of time. Go home, pack and... and I'll meet you... Meet you at the airport. [sighs] Okay. Oh, do you have my painting? Yes. No. [sighs] Do you need it? Yes, it is an original of Ellis Wilson, remember? You got it for me. Okay. All right, all right, all right, all right. I'll... I'll... I'll get it. Okay. Is your wife going to be there? [sighs] Probably not. She's... I don't know. She'll probably be with a girlfriend or something. Well, it sounds like she's still in love with you, Evan. I thought you said that you all were completely done. We are. It's over. We're done. I'll explain it to you on a plane. Just go home, pack and... and I'll meet you at the airport, all right? Okay. Bye. All right. Bye. The hell is she doing home? [indistinct chatter] What the hell going on here? [Adrian and Erica laughing] What the hell? [chatter continues] [laughter continues] [Adrian] So we're going door to door. - [Erica] You got a window? - [crosstalk] - We got there. - [laughing continues] What the... I thought you said he was going out of town. That's what he told me. Then why is he standing in front of us? I don't know. Hey, hey, hey. I'm standing right here, like, I can hear you talking about me. He seems upset. Which is odd, 'cause he was leaving me for his secretary. - [Adrian] Secretary? - Mm-hmm. [laughs] That's so cliché. I know, right. All right. And low key, I think she's a stripper on the side, though. [Adrian] Why do you think that? Well, I met her. She look like a little Instagram slutty ho-ish thot. Interesting. Ain't that interesting about it, brah. She ain't no Instagram thot, she is a lady. Let me be very clear about that. That's number one. Number two, she's not my secretary. She's my boss's secretary. I told you that. Number three, you need to roll about my bed, brah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. Where are you going? I thought you was heading to Atlanta with your little stripper chick trick. What you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here in bed with some dude? What do you care? - What do I care? - Yeah, what do you care? What do I care? You are repeating my words, word for word. Clarity. You know, last time I remember, I was pouring my heart out to you, Evan. And what you wanna go do? You had to go pee. Suck it. So, you rush home to be in bed with some dude? You need to explain yourself. I need to explain myself? Why do I need to explain myself, Evan? [Evan] What do you mean why? Why do I need to explain myself to someone who wants to be as far away from me as the eye can see? Okay. You're right. That's my... I'm saying, I was... Got my feelings a little bit, but that's my bad. Y'all have a nice night. Hope you choke on the popcorn, nigga. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Y'all gotta bear with me for second. Just one second. Just hold off. One second. You were just telling me how much you love me, and then you were berating me for my situation, which I understand, had an affair, cheated on her, she found out, it's my bad. I'm sorry about it, but berating me over my situation, here you are in bed with some dude. This fast? Like, how... how long it's been going on here? [sighs] We just met. Get the funk outta here. Hey, hey... Erica. Come on, Erica. For real. For real. Don't play me like I'm stupid, Erica. You know, I've been over here, been on this Earth for a long time. I am not dumb. All right? You can just talk to me. All right? It's still me and you, for real. What's going on? For real? She being real with you right now, brah? Hey, dude. I know you're in a bad situation like you ain't expect all this. I got it. This conversation is right here between me and my wife. - Feel me? - Oh! So, matter of fact, why don't you go on downstairs and let me have conversation with my wife? No, no, no, no, no. You don't want me to be your wife, Evan. Because you are getting a divorce. - Remember? - I remember what I said, Erica. But the reality of the situation is we ain't divorced yet. You understand me? Hmm. Wow. In my mind, we are getting a divorce. Come on. Take it. Ah. Okay. Okay. He stays. See? There you go, Erica. There you... You always got to be in control of the situation. That's the problem right there. As far as I remember, I'm still the man in this house and you will respect me. Or what? Listen, Erica. I ain't threatening you or nothing like that. You ain't got swell up on me. I'm just... Fine. You want him to stay? You want to stay, brah? You cool? You... You comfortable under the blankets? You want some more popcorn? Let's let him make a decision. He grown, he can make decisions for himself. You want to stay here? Me and my wife going downstairs and talk or do you want to go downstairs, me and my wife stay up here and talk? What you want to do, brah? It is not his decision to make. You're staying, aight? So, what do you want, Evan? I want to know how long it's been going on. I already told you. We just met tonight, literally. We met on Tinder. Tinder? Tinder. Tinder. [phone ringing] - Hello. - [Denise] Hey. Have you left yet? - No, not yet. - Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, let me... I'mma call you back. She shopping for some new stripper clothes? Look, Erica, I get it. You pissed at me about the way I handled the situation. Do you really care? Or is your l'il ego bruised? Or are you feeling like you're losing control of our destiny? Which is it, Evan? Because you said to me, "We're done, Erica." You said, "You're ghetto." And... and you also said, "I don't want you no mo'." But now you trippin' off some dude being in the bed for real, though? So, which is it? Huh? I mean, what? What? The point is, to have some dude in our bed this fast? Okay. All right, let's deal with the reality of the situation, - Erica. - [Erica] Yeah. - You damn near 50. - Oh, my God. Hold on, hold on. Rock with me, rock with me. Hold on. But you look like you're in your 30s. But you even act like you in your 30s. And you're beautiful for your age. I'm damn near 50. I look like I'm damn near 50, and I act like I'm damn near 50. And I'm not beautiful for my age. So, why would you want me? Because you are still the handsome, beautiful man - that I married. - Oh, come on, Erica. The handsome man you want right now is upstairs in our bed, because he's trending more like Morris Chestnut and I'm trending more like Martin Lawrence. Martin Lawrence is handsome. He ain't handsome as Morris Chestnut. Morris Chestnut walk in this room right now, women throwing their panties out. Martin Lawrence walk in here, people gonna say, "He's coming around." Come on, man. [laughs] I'm... I'm being real with you, Erica. Listen, you want to be with a man that you wanna look at. That ain't me anymore. I ain't nothing to even look at. And you should be with somebody that you want to look at and what? - This is crisis talk. - This is not crisis talk. Erica, I'm not aging well. And... and... And you're an older woman who wants to be with a younger man. I'm with a younger woman who wants to be with the older man. It's just the way the world works. I mean... Eventually, you're going to see a younger man and you're going to leave me. And you should. You should be with somebody that... that you want to be with. That's who you should be with. I should be with the man I'm married, whom I love. Yeah, well, it seems how you got a man in on our bed this fast, don't seem like you love me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, considering that you said you don't want me, what the heck you expect me to do? [scoffs] Did you mean what you said? I mean... In the moment. And I'm saying, like... at this time. You know what I'm saying? Where you at an age, where it's like... You feel me? But at the end of the day, it's like we all got that kind of thing going on. You know what I'm saying? And it's like... You know what I mean? But at the end of the day, real talk. You know what it is, Erica? You know what it is. You know what I'm saying? Considering you did not complete not one damn sentence... I know exactly what you saying. Unlike you, who all of a sudden, or actually over the past year or so, seems to have forgotten who I am. You know, but I didn't forget who you are. Not at all. And you actually kind of sound like the Evan that I married 15 years ago. But be it that Evan or this crazy ass Evan standing in front of me talking about he ain't handsome enough and I need to be with a... A younger man, he got to have a younger woman. Whoever this Evan is... I'm there for you. I've always been there for you. But you don't like who I am. [scoffs] No, you don't. And hey, maybe this is a crisis. Maybe it's not a crisis, but you don't love me. And you... you don't want me to be with anybody. But you want me to be with a young and handsome man. I don't know what you want, Evan. What the hell do you want? You know, I tell you what you should do. Just go and be with your little Insta thot, all right? Y'all go ahead, make babies, so they can grow up and call you Grandpa. And then, I'll tell you what. You'll be happy since she thinks you're handsome. And I think you look like Jerome. Aight? [footsteps stomping] ♪ [phone ringing] [cell phone rings] Oh, man. Hey. Hey, where are you? Yeah, um, I'm... I'mma miss this flight. What? I know. I'm sorry. Evan? Listen, catch the flight. Let me know that you got to Atlanta safely and... And I'll call you later. Hello? Hello? Oh, no, he did not hang up on me. She gon' handcuff me and then have some dude? No, it ain't going down like this. [both laughing] - [Adrian] That's a lot. - Aha! I caught you. Y'all was doing it and I caught you. Put your clothes on real fast, didn't you? Heard me coming up the steps, grabbed your little chains, your little bracelet and things, threw your clothes on. Ain't that what happened? Mm? - Does he do drugs? - He didn't used to. I don't do no damn drugs. That's it. You know what? You stay here, you stay right there. Eat your popcorn. Enjoy your movie. You. You and me, we're fittin' to have a conversation. You understand me? You chill, you get up. Let's go. We having a conversation right now. Come on. [Adrian] That boy crazy. All right, Erica. [sighs] Here's the... He need to be up there. No, never mind. I take that back. That no good, heck... She ain't just... - [laughs] Oh, my goodness. - That's crazy. [Erica] Real crazy. - Um... - No, no, look. Hello. Didn't you just hear me ask you to come down here, have a conversation with me? No, I'mma tell you what I heard. I heard some crazy person barking at me like I'm a dang gone dog. That's what I heard. So, if you want something from me then you gon' ask me like a gentleman. And you're going to respect me for the queen that I am. [sighs] Erica, do you mind accompanying me to the kitchen so that you and I may partake in a conversation? [whispers] Please? Please? Sure. Adrian, I'll be right back. Oh, no, no. She ain't going to be right back. We gonna talk until we finish... She'll be right back. [laughs] What's going on here? You're doing all this just to piss me off? Why would you be pissed off? Because you got another man in our home, in our bed? And you got a thot at the airport waiting' on you to go to Atlanta with so y'all can share the same bed. At least I tried to talk to you about my situation. You ain't said nothing to me about this. So, bringing up a couple of times of you talkin' to me and each time being lame. And then, if you really wanted to talk to me, you would be doing exactly - what you're doing right now. - See, that's the problem. And you can't tell me how to say what I wanted to say. You always want me to do things your way instead of understanding my way. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. No, I don't. I just want you to do things better and more prudent. Indicating that you always the best and my way ain't good. Well, if it ain't good, it ain't workin'. It does work. The only reason it ain't working because it ain't done the way you want it done. - Oh, please. - Don't "Oh, please me." If you would take a moment to hear me, and stop trying to be my mom, we'd be in a better place No, we'd be in a better place if you actually knew how to communicate effectively. I don't even know why I came back here. I don't know why you came back here. And standing and looking all special. I didn't ask you to come back. Wait a minute, where are you going? To finish my movie. To finish a movie? To finish a movie? Is that what you just said to me? Word for word. So you just going to walk out of one of the most important conversations of... You know, Evan... You know what? You are going through a crisis, for real. You may not believe that you are going through a crisis. But see, I believe that you... being of a sound mind, if in fact that is the case, then you know what, boo? I don't want to be around that. I won't be treated like that. And I don't wanna keep going through this, boo. So good luck. And goodbye. Not less than two hours ago, you were fighting for our marriage. You said you were crazy enough and thirsty enough to fight for us. All of a sudden, that's out the window now? What do you want, Evan? What do you want from me? Do you want this? Or do you want that thot? This or thot? This or thot? Real talk, man. Okay, you want to have a conversation, we gonna have that motha. I am ghetto. Mm-hmm. And you don't want to be around my ghetto. Bye. Okay? Oh, oh, but you do want a younger woman who wants a old man. And then I want a younger man, according to you. So, what the hell you want, Evan? What do you want? Yeah, yeah. That's what I thought. Hey, Erica. Do you got anymore popcorn? Hey, dude. Hey, for real. Hey, for real, man. Here you go. Here goes some right here. Come on. Let go, man, for real. Okay, thank you, man. Appreciate you. Why don't you just go get in your car and you go drive to the airport, and meet your little shorty hoochie mama and go to Atlanta like you planned. Please, just leave me alone. Okay? Go be with your little girl who ain't ghetto and who wants you as an older man. - I'm out. - I want you, Erica. What? - I want you. I want us. - [sighs] Why? Why all of a sudden do you want us, Evan? I don't know. I mean, I know. - I know I love you. - [sighs] And... and I don't know, Erica, I'm not aging well, Erica. Or at least I'm not handling it well. I mean, you don't know what it's like for a man to have everything on you just deteriorating. Boy, are you crazy? I am older woman. I am aging. I see it every day. I see it in the lines in my mouth, I see it in the bags under my eyes. My booty... This isn't about you, Erica, You don't know what it's like for a man to have everything on you deteriorating. As men, we're supposed to be men at all times, at all cost. And I ain't the man no more. Stuff for me don't work. I don't even have all my damn teeth. I can't even eat a sandwich. Go to the store, get a nice little sandwich. Got all this thick bread and I am chewing it. Then, my partial get stuck in the bread and I done swallow my damn tooth. Damn. Who wants to be with a man that swallows his damn teeth? [Adrian] Damn. That really happened to you, my dude? Yeah, it happened to me, Nick. It happened. It swallowed my damn teeth. Can you mind your business? Wow. All right. So, yes, Erica, I thought you would not want to be with a man who swallows his damn teeth. A younger woman, obviously don't mind being with an older man who swallows his teeth. If she's with an older man, it comes with the territory. You hurt me, Evan. I know. And I'm sorry. Are you really sorry or are you just saying that 'cause... [sighs] Erica, hurting you was never my intent. Intent? Don't nobody care about no intentions. Actions, Evan. That's what my mama taught me. She taught me that actions, they speaker louder than words, boo. All day, every day. I feel you in that, Erica. Look, all I can really tell you is I didn't realize how much I hurt you until now. Yes, because you had no respect for my pain until you felt what I was feeling. I can see what you mean by that. So, is this whole situation with that boy - just a stunt or something? - Oh. No, it wasn't a stunt, E. I thought you was gone. Look, Erica, all I can tell you is... from day one, you always been real with me. You always been there for me. You were my best friend. And even though my ego couldn't deal with the fact that I'm getting old and stuff breaking down, have to take pills to have sex 'cause all there's drama. You ain't never leave me. You ain't never stop fighting for me. You are a great wife. You are a great wife. I don't know you saying this because you truly mean it. Are you saying it because you've been thinking about me and him sexually? Oh, come on, Erica. I mean... It crossed my mind. - I ain't gon' front. - Damn. But thinking about y'all having sex had nothing to do with what I'm saying right now. Nothing. Yeah. Erica, listen, I was wrong. I cheated on you. I lied to you. I got it. I was wrong. But Erica, I love you. I need you. That's why I'm asking you. No, no. I'm begging you. Please take me back as your husband. I love you. I love you. I love you more than you'll ever know, Evan. You didn't even realize that I got this. I wore this on the first day we met. You didn't even notice. As much as I love you... I can't take you back. Wait, what? I can't do it. Why? You showed me that over a period of time... you could just move on. You just move on and let me get up. [scoffs] But... Erica, we were... We were just working it out. We were... We were bonding and everything. I heard music playing and everything, like... I can't. Okay, Erica, wait a minute. Listen, I realized I was tripping. I was in the wrong. I got that now. I was... I was acting out because I was getting older. You were right. I believe you. Trust, I do. I really believe what you're saying to me. So, why can't we work it out? Because we're done. Oh, excuse me. - Hey, dude. - Not now, man. For real, not now. But there's a woman out here scratching up your car. What? What the hell! Denise, what the hell are you doing? [gasps] Oh, snap. Oh, you're in there making up with her, aren't you? Keying my car ain't gonna change that. Yeah, but it'll make me feel a whole lot better. Denise, stop. Why did you do this to me? All right, look, Denise. I'mma keep it completely 100 with you. 100? 100. What does that mean? Lord have mercy. The child don't even know what 100 means. - What does what mean? - 100. It means I'mma be completely honest with you. Well, why didn't you just say you were going to be completely honest with me? Damn it, Denise. Are you going to let me talk or you gonna keep talking? So, you were lying to me? - No. - [Denise scoffs] So, now you feel the need to be completely honest with me. So, that means if you are now being completely honest with me, that means you weren't being completely honest with me then. Denise, are you going to let me explain? - Oh, my freakin gosh. - I got this. - Look here, little girl. - [screams] Now, you know what you going to do with your little triflin' self? You are going to stop with this crap. You gon' stop. You sounding like my little baby doll I was sent when I was 12 years old. We gonna go in this house, you're going to take your triflin' horse ass inside. You're going to sit down and you going to listen to me. Explain what's really going on, you understand me? Living like a Magic City. [Evan] All this God darn violence. - [Evan] Erica. - [Erica] Hush. I ain't talking to you. All right. Get in there. Move. Girl, you know what? You give hoes a bad name? - Now, sit down. - I'm not a ho. Executive assistant. If you don't hop your little fast-tail up on this counter right now... [grunts] Now, look, little girl. This is the deal. I am your judge. I am your jury. I am your prosecutor, and I am your defense attorney. - Ya mean? Ya mean? - Yummy. - Ya mean. - Yeah, that's right. Okay. So, now you all up in here all upset, you know, all sad and boo-hoo because you was about to start a whole new life with... Really? [scoffs] So, you was believing that you was going to start this whole new life with a married man who is still with his wife. You was done before you even started. And that is why you was so emotional. So, as much as you want to be upset with Evan because of his actions, you need to be upset with yourself. So, this what you gonna do, boo. You gonna jump down and you're gonna go up in that man's face, and you gonna say, "Hey, look homie. Look, until you value me as the queen I am, you ain't never..." You better roll that neck with the two ounces of sister girl you got inside of you. "You ain't never going to have a part of me again." And then you bounce. Go! Get down. Go stand it up to that man and tell him what's up. Right now. Let's go. Evan, I am a queen and... Wait. What do I say again? Girl, know your worth and say what you need to say. What the hell's wrong with you? Right? Okay. Evan, I am a queen and I deserve way more than this. And if you don't value me the way that I value myself, then shame on me. Now, if you want me, you better recognize my word and treat me as such. But until then, I am leaving. And I'm going to hope that you value me. Little girly girl, Denise. Yeah, right. Because I am worth it. Okay, bye. Bounce, bounce, bounce. And don't you ever come back up in my... If I ever see you again. Wow. That was some deep, powerful stuff. You gonna help that girl. Yeah, nah. I just wanted to get her out of the house. She irritates the hell out of me. [chuckles] Um, Adrian, can you do me a favor and... give us a moment? No, I'm going to go. I am not gonna stay, but I want to thank you for being that beautiful woman of your word. It was truly an honor. Hey. It was truly a pleasure meeting you. Yeah, it was an honor meeting you too. Yep, it was a cool meeting. All right. It's all good. Um... [clears throat] So take care of yourself. And, Adrian... Yes. You got a piece of popcorn on your head. - I'm just... - Yeah. - Okay. - [whispers] Okay, Daddy. Couple of pieces, actually. - Thank you. - Oh, my Lord. Okay, yeah. - [Adrian speaking indistinctly] - [both laugh] - I got you, boo. I got you. [Adrian] Lookin' out. Whoo! My brah. [sighs] I'm going pray you get some permanent dentures. You don't get out of my house, you're gonna need dentures. - [Erica chuckles] - I'll be back. [Erica sighs, clears throat] [Erica taps fingers] I'll, um... start looking for B&B or a hotel or something and I... I'll be out your way. And we'll go from there. Okay. Okay. I really am sorry, Erica. You know, Evan... I believe you. I do. [inhales deeply] [exhales, scoffs] [chuckles] Hey, Evan. Please quit your job, all right? Because... your music is really good. [Evan chuckles] I mean... Look, I know you got that job in the first place because you wanted to provide and... [breathes deeply] make sure that we were straight, but... [chuckles] Your songwriting skills, man, I never asked you to quit. I never asked you to quit your music. So do me a favor, please. Go back. Because you are amazing. You know what I mean?
