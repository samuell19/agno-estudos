Stay at your seat, Mr. Chairman. For 37 years I work here. From a small, lousy dump… we made a big one… I mean, what we are today. And it is not up to you… - I do not wish that you… - If I may say so, Go ahead. Moment! I'm listening. Wait, I'm catching up. The thing with the dump you have already said. Ähhh… yes! This is what I wanted to say! I decide when I'm sick and tired of your tubes. I already know when! Now! My God! You frightened me! I live here. But not now, at this time.

The coat is still perfect! I wanted it for Dieter to wear! He will be happy, when he inherits Dad's coat. - Renate! - He will be overhappy for joy. Why do you always throw all my things away? The dog would have to go out any time soon. Darling, this is no answer to my question. And the dog may go out, when I think it is time. Wutz! Wutz, you've to come with your master now! Wutz, here is your master! - Good morning, Mr. Lohse. - Good morning. Wutz! Here is the master! Stupid Dog. Well? Did he made some business? He had, ah so, could not see it so accurate. - I go shopping now. - No. Give it to me. - I think it's really nice… - We had this discussed already. That falls into my work area. But you do not even know what I… Your husband was 17 years Director of the Purchasing Department. I've placed the cans over here. - What do you want? What cans? - I would like… 2 fish balls and a jucy gulasch. You haven't placed it there. Yes, please? - A caraway cheese. - Otherwise, they would have to stand there. My name is Lohse. I do shopping here. But I placed them next to the potato salad. - Then they got picked up. Yes? - A caraway cheese and tomatoes. - If they're gone… - I would like to shop here. Who would have them picked up? Yes, please? - I want to… - But I was here! - Then they are somewhere else. - A caraway cheese, please. - Otherwise, they would be here. - Where? Yes? Well, where you have placed them. A caraway cheese, please and 2 pounds of tomatoes. I always put them here. What is it you want? My name is Lohse, I would like to buy something. Would also tell me, what it should be? I don't like the way you talk to me. We will not make business. So, we've got two options. Either I'll read as a whole before, what is on the list, or we go through one by one. Please? So then, a glass of mustard. 1.29 1.29. Does it becomes cheaper if I take several? At 10 glasses you save… 60 cents. That sounds better already. And at 50? - Mr. Lohse! - Oh, Mrs. Mielke! - Are you not going to office today? - I, uh, so, uh, no. Not directly. My work currently focuses more on the domestic sphere. You are retired! You can… could also say in that way, yes. Could you hold me the sack? Yes, sure, but I must also… Thank you. So. Then I have to… I'd also have a cup of beef soup. I can warm it up for you. - Ms. Mielke… - It would be quite fast. - Maybe soon. - This will be kept secret. My sister is in such matters is always something… Although… the thing with her husband at that time was only gossip. He died very naturally. But you do not necessarily… No, no. So then… Ha! That's… Mr. Lohse wanted to ask you. I said, - That thou were not there. - I have to soon… What did you want to ask me Mr. Lohse? Oh, it has time. I have to my life… the supply, my life supplied… first get… Goodbye. Brigitte, could you over to me? Renate! Renate? Stop! Place the back there! How did you get in? Through the front door. - What is your name? - Kleinert. I clean here. As you can see, My name is Lohse. In future we will work together… No, uh, discard that. Homeworks demands an efficient organization to be effective. - Do you have it? - Yes, Mr. Lohse. The main principle is this: "Think first, then act" This is Ms. Kleinert, our maid. My wife. Mrs. Kleinert, we can do the curtains. I don't want to be interrupted now. I'm in a meeting with Ms. Kleinert. It would be very friendly, if you can push in an appointment for me after that meeting. - Um… what was the last item? - What? What I have just said. - "acting. Then acting." - Yes. - By the way, Ms., uh… - Kleinert. I will help you until your are worked-in. I will lead by giving a a good example. What was the principle that your activities were based on? Yes… I would have made the beds now. Wrong. Your role is in the stairwell, I will make the beds and you will join me later on. - Well then! - Yes. - Where are the beds? - That I have to air… Ms., uh, Kleinert, our working plan undergoes a change. We will go to the garden first. In unforeseen events you must adjust to the new conditions. Um… best is to remove the blanket now from the thing, the, uh, climbing rose. Yes, Mr. Lohse. And stay calm. We have a very important Message for you. Oh? No, Rita, you have no clue! Sorry, it has rung. I'll call you back. Those are our beds. I just asked Ms. Kleinert to… And those are the Glöckners. They have an important message. We do not subscribe to magazines. - Is it about magazines? - No. - No. - No. Would you bring it upstairs? I can handle it. Here you are. Excuse me. My wife is a little suspicious. This is not meant personally. May I offer you something? According to the calculations of the internationally recognized Professor Pirkheimer Venus, the Moon Tetra his left orbit and now racing toward the Earth. Its impact is imminent. This means the end of our planet. You know, that is a bad timing. I thought you had… Only those people who are clean inside and outside, have nothing to fear. This handmade brush from pure natural bristle I could handout to you for just 28.50 Mark. That is very amiable, but I think… For 32 DM, we recommend this bathing salt. - No, no. - Even without cash. If you want to sign here please? No, no… You will receive our delivery every month - To account for 2% discount. - Or the fees will be withdrawn from your bank account with 5% discount. If you do not immediately decide, it does not matter. We would then always come over every Thursday. Oh? Where do I sign? The delivery for Lohse. This is getting bit much to me now. - But it is your order. - What? Oh, yes. you can put it right here. - Here? - Yes, please. - Bye, boss. - Goodbye. What was that message about? That was a message from Professor Pirkheimer because of the impending collision. It is possible the end, to the imminent end of our civilization. Hopefully, you've nothing signed? I, um, no. This will be charged from the bank account. What is debited? Um… Brushes. Root brushes and, uh, natural bath additive. A ton of bathing salt? No. That's mustard. 150 glasses. Mustard! Well, thank God! The world is at the end, but we have mustard, root brushes and bathing salt. What happend? Your father wants to give something. What? Oh, yes. This is my… that was my best coat. That mantle I used to date your mother. Put it on. Perfect. The button can be sewed. Posh! Turn around. Fits like a glove. If my father would had given me such a coat! Are you happy? Please, Say! And the color suits you so well! That you can wear it at grandma's birthday. - Say something! - Great… - Look, a squirrel. - Look, a squirrel! A squirrel! I open up my marital problems and what does my friend say? Look, a squirrel! For 17 years I have been comfortably married. I had the houshold, then there was Dieter, and Heinrich was in his company throughout the day in good hands. That has never been disturbed so far. - But you were complaining - complaining? That he never had time. I did not know how it is like if he has the time. Then look for a job. Couples are only happy, if one never has time. I cooked something hot for us. What's that? Meatballs from a can. Königsberg was the capital of… I know. - How is your school? - Fine. A short while ago you were born. And now we sit together at dinner. At your age I was very interested in sports. - For the top athletes. - Hm hm. Sit up straight, boy. Who is… whom you admire? - Whom do you find great? - Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson. He was boxing champion light heavyweight. But then he was beaten by Eddie Alersmeier in 1952. For those facts I have a good memory. What would a boxer do once retiered. The day after tomorrow Michael Jackson will give a concert. Is this the idea! You, uh, the young lady, that were there the other day, um… is it yours, is the, um… is she in your class? Hm-hm. And, uh, if you… So when you're together, how, uh, is it so, when you are um… Look, your mother and I… we are not by nature, such old, come up the world at that age. Um… the important thing is that you, um… Especially when you're young because the body is, uh… This is quite natural, um… Thus, the physical, I mean. Men are… and women also… Think about it! Especially because I thing good of you. Do we understand each other? Hm-hm. Nice we have talked about everything. Women also have their advantages. Back there my mother went to school. Here my brother-in-law lived before. There though the backyard. 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 1st, 2nd Where is the 3? Where is the 3? Wo ist der 3? Please go to the living room. I'll make the tea. Oh, Mr. Lohse! Nice, that we also meet each other. I'm just trying to get an overview. Over the existing paper material. Heinrich! Why can't you do that another day? No, with a timely notice I would have reserved the use of the living room. Take a seat. Let us not be disturbed. If something gets mixed up, could I start over again? - It's chewing gum. - This was the FRANKFURTER! What a strong man you have, Mrs. Lohse! You don't feel well, Brigitte? Heinrich, wont you walk the dog? No. That was not the topic. Mrs. Bredenbek, I must ask you to stand up. You are sitting on the cultural part of the WORLD. No, this is not cultural part. But I had it put down here somewhere. Please look for among yourselves. Maybe someone is sitting on it. - Please keep… - I must insist! Could you help me, Heinrich? I knew it! Never mind! I have plenty of time! Why didn't you throw away these newspapers? I did not know that you and your culture club… No one will look ever into it again. How should I get the houshold going… Let me see you, if I take the papers… I want to know who, when, where drinks coffee! What kind of impression will it give! Also, you're also interested, that order… What actually gotten into you? This is Püppi. Waiter? The do not like us here. Waiter, could we bring YOU something? Waiter? Madam, Sir, have you made a choice? Yes, for quite some time. We would like calf's liver for two. - This is not recommended. - Oh, and what else? Homemade chicken soup, but I would not advise that also. And fish? - Then I'll take the hunter's spear. - As you wish. - Do you have Pear Helene? - Heinrich! This is our specialty. We serve natural mark of pears with vanilla sauce. Pear Helene is a cooked pear with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Ours comes with vanilla sauce and is always recommended. Your pear is all but no pear Helene. - How about the apple pie. - No, thank you. So, one hunter's spear. If I hear Pear Helene again, I throw myself down and bite into the carpet! Oh! I have imagined your retirement differently. This is my first retirement! I still practice! I just thought… My God! Why are men insensitive! Everyone can hear what you say. Unfortunately, I don't understand you at all. - Hunter's spear for one. - Thank you very much. You should start eating right now, it is not very hot. - And mine? - You did not order anything. - Then I'll take the chicken soup. - Chicken soup. Give it here, I'll do it. Maybe you can let me do a least something on my own! Please, please! I said nothing. Order yourself a hunter's spear. This is mine. It is on my side of the table. Have you ever seen it, how it looks, when you do so? What do I do? - When I do that? - Always. Here, you have done it 3 times already. Then it is a lovley tick. You know, what are you doing? - What? - That. May I clear up? No, we're not yet done. - Should I vanish into thin air? - It would be quite fabulous, If his Lordship, Director Lohse would have left the Director at the company - and comes here just as Mr. Lohse. - Just Mr. Lohse? "Just"? I'm Heinrich Lohse, happily married, ha-ha! With one child and fixed income. What do you mean by "just"? I wish only that we do not sit in your company but you at our home quiet and peacefully. - Old and fat! - That would not be the worst. I will put in more effort. Excuse me, my name is Drögel. I was inadvertently witness of your conversation. - I am in a hurry. - I like the way you… It is rare that ladies, tells a men directly sometimes to… Excuse me, but… We are a well-known Confectionery company the company Riegel and Klotz, formerly Seidemann, Bielefeld. Well, um, yes, yes. We are looking for ladies who feel joy in their work. May I offer you my card? Excuse me. I had it in my hand the whole time already. Thank you very much. I would be happy to hear from you. One chicken soup. - Heinrich? - No fear. Everything alright. I do not make beds, Don't buy a anything and only go up the stairs and perhaps back down. - If I may! - Come here. Sorry, Heinrich. So it was not meant in that way. I know, this is all not easy for you too. I should have given you more help. - What happend? - You could be here with us with your family and have your own domain. - Aha! - Only for you. Where you never… where no one bothers you, also times where you can be loud. Loud? Where you can be as you want. If we keep a little order… That could be but very… That could be quite comfortable. For DIY or something. And here, this we take away. Then you have room for models. - Hm .. - Models… or something. Are there in every cellar men in retirement? Here you also have light… and water… Well, what do you mean? Could I still stay on the surface? The Mielke-sisters will come soon. They'll pick me up. Oh, Mrs. Lohse! I did not know, that your husband is home! Would you like to say hello? Nope. I stay here lying very quiet and peacefully. Coffee in a thermos flask, Sausage sandwiches in the fridge. Are you listening? I got your point! - Good day, Ms. Mielke. - Good day, Mrs. Lohse! Ach, Frau Lohse! I didn't know, that your husband is home! Day, Mrs. Mielke! Nice of you again… - Are you sick? - My husband has just a bit stretched out. Have time off times. Very reasonable. Not quite true, Mrs. Mielke. I am retired. Mr. Lohse is retired! We really did not know. - Why don't you come with us? - Yes, why not? No, no… We need more men for our cultural events. This is really very kind, But my wife said, I should once… My husband does not like poetry readings. - That's really something new! - We have discussed, that you wanted to stay home. Well, he still could! Mr. Lohse! Well, I'll quickly wear something. Ladies and gentlemen. For the second time in this year we come together for an event of our cultural group. This afternoon is devoted to contemporary literature. We are very lucky that the most important representative, living representative, the most important, most lived, So, still living representative of modern poetry agreed, here with us to read from his work. A man who has made literary history a name, the worldwide known: - Lothar Frohlein. - Frohwein. Frohwein. I shall begin to read 22 poems from the series "farewell". - Then… - A little louder, please! Eight ballads from my early period, followed by the sonnets collection "The 12 months". Afterwards Chapter 3 from the novel "Pedokles" and finally a tragedy in three acts with the title: "Goethe in Halberstadt. Then we will have the opportunity to talk. Melosine… Is that part of your lecture? A piece of sugar would always help me. - He should hold his breath. - What do you think? We have to scare him. Or ask something, that distracts him. Shh! Excuse me, may I interrupt you. Heinrich! What did you eat yesterday evening? Um… turnips Steamed turnips fish sticks and… Tartar sauce. Melosine… Krawehl, krawehl! Taubtrüber Ginst at Musenhain! Trübtauber Hain on Musenginst! Krawehl, krawehl! Before I was thinking, that we live parallel to each other. You've already told 3 times. I told him what I think and I thought he would have understood! He throws no more beds out the window, no! Now he is discussing with Lothar Frohlein! - One sausage for the lady. - Thank you very much. Perhaps there is also something else than men. What do you mean? Don't let you get mad. Let's do it, what they want. There are such beautiful meh… uh, more… options Compared to women men are really not interesting. Just ignore him. Ha! Did I catch you, my darling! Haha! - That was quite a brilliant move. - Thank you! Good Day, Rita. I thought to myself - I know, that you're in town - it would be great if we meet somewhere. By chance. I also do not disturb. So think as I would not even be there. - Do you have a wish? - A pot of coffee. - A coffee. - Do you know who is sitting there? Where? Over there! The lady with the bright Hat. This is Lisbeth! - Lisbeth Prenzler! - Heinrich! Well, chunky bit? Come on, put on your glasses! It's me! Heinrich Lohse! How are you? Got a little bit sized-up. Suits you, however. - Is your husband here? - I am not married. We had visited you in Hamburg before! I live in Würzburg. For 36 years. No. Your son studied in Hamburg and lived with you. - I have no son. - Of course you have, Lisbeth! My name is Käthe. Oh… Käthe… You know, I'll have to leave now. I'll call you. So, I would not have recognized Lisbeth. How is she? Good. She lives in Würzburg now. Where's Rita? She had to go. I have to hurry too. Probably you have something planned too. Yes. But if you would ask me I would go with you. As a caring husband. As a little mouse. So! So… What do you want to buy? Just look around a bit first. Just look around… And where do we look around first? That's interesting. Look! These are these tube systems. We have sold a lot to Mexico. And to Cuba. I did not know, that we exhibit here. The whole system works without backwater valves. Interesting, right? The rear opening should be for the overflow. It is hard to recognize. But, yes! From here you could see it. Very interesting shopping tour. Renate? When are we going home? For mother's birthday I need another pair of shoes. We have just bought shoes. The brown one with pimples. - That was six years ago. - Yes, exactly. Why do you not try some black underwear? - What? - Yes? Want look around much longer? I don't push you. Take your time. How long… How long do you think because, I mean… until you have seen everything? Of course relaxed. - You know .. - I don't push you, not at all. I just wanted to know, how long it would last. - Roughly. - Just one moment. - What are you looking for? - I don't know. You don't know what you're looking for? So, I now have seen everything and now I know that here, that I really don't know - What you are still here for… - Why are you so impatient? Well, listen! In 45 minutes I have, well, let's say seen 2000 blouses, shirts and pants. This is more than in the 59 years before. I thought, I should prepare to stay overnight. - What's Up? - Nothing at all. - Wanted to drive? - No, no, you drive. Was it nice afterall, that together we have purchased something. Too nice. Did you see that? He came from the right! No, I do not see anything. I can't see anything! I always close my eyes, because of the traffic that makes me nervous. But drive a little bit slower and stay on your lane. I drive exactly 50 km/h. See? I knew it! No, no, no! - What happend? - You drive! Then we come home safely, harmoniously and without a crisis. My name is Lohse. My wife and I only exchange seats. There were discrepancies because of the driving style. I thought it would be better to let my husband drive. In my position You would have decided the same. We will continue quite soon. Here it is! "The Mini Piffi 4 "was manufactured with all new gear "and thoroughly tested before leaving the factory. "The Mini Piffi 4 mixes fast and easily…" Isn't there a japanese explanation? Moment… I see. Give it to me and sit down in the living room. Times and please do nothing. Oh, sorry! I haven't seen you. Well… - Please sit down! - Mr. Lohse! Well, 'n sip in between? Here you are. Do you clean your home? Or does it .. Do you have… a clean… a cleaning… help? My wife don't let me help out anymore. But I help her after all. You can, but I may not. She does not like my help. That is probably just a matter of communication. That is probably a matter with her gender. This is the old hatred of the sexes. This is it. When I get home see my husband sitting there… A certain reluctance between women and men - Is quite natural. - Yes it is. Apart from reproduction. - Yes it is. - This is another issue. My husband too has always something. Men always have something. He always has something. Women and men are enemies, only at one point… - One should not marry. - One should rather try to balance the differences between the sexes. Men do not even listen anymore! We should have talked much more together! - Do I disturb? - No. Would you please come again? Well excuse me. When I need you, you are drinking together with Ms. Kleinert! Tell me, before you marry her, and whether you want to live here then! - Should be a surprise. - The thing does not work. Why not? Am I the Diplom-Engineer or you? This is a very simple mechanism. - Hello, Mrs. Kleinert! - I'm doing the beds now. We should let them know, whether after the wedding we - want to live here. - Goodbye. This is Uli. Good morning, I have an appointment with Mr Drögel. - With whom? - Mr. Drögel. Drögel… Drögel, Drögel, Drögel, Drögel, Drögel… - I don't know him. - He is a Director here. Oh, you mean Mr. Director Drögel. Is in the fabrics hall, straight through the sliding door. Good day, Heinrich, this is Renate! Rubbish, Kurt… Heinrich. Heinrich, I mean. Where's Kurt? Is he at home? For a long time we haven't… How's it going? It is easy to loose contact… Tell me where… where is Kurt? Yes. Here is Heinrich. Gerti, I'm here in a phone booth and he would have liked to talk to him. Do you think I can quickly at yours… Yes? Right now? Yes. Well, see… see you. Yes. Hello? Oh! Madam! This is really nice! My name is Lohse. You kindly had… - given me your business card. - I know, I know. I am glad that you are here. Mr. Drögel, before you get a wrong impression… We are a leader for 27 years in production and sale of chocolate bars. - Mr Drögel… - If I may say so, I have taken over the company from my Uncle Erich Klotz, My mother is a Klotz, and continue to lead the company under the name Klotz' Bars, because Klotz' Bar is a highly valued brand name. And, um, because the name "Bar-Drögel" - Or "Drögel-Bar" not… - Mr. Bar, uh, Mr. Drögel, I had not really the intend to be employed. But for personal reasons I do not want to stay at home the whole day… Mrs. Lohse, I know what you wanted to say. We offer you a free lancer position as a counterweight to your domestic partner, which you probably need some space. - Not to, uh… - Uh, yes, yes. But how do you know if I 'm suited for this work? I feel it. Why should I know, why Renate has changed? How about a Zeppelin? We write on it "Renate, I love you." Renate never looks up. Or I'll get you the chancellor for breakfast. - This is still missing! - I could arrange that. - No. - Buy buy a new suit. - Women are in that way… - How's Renate? Good. Uh, thank you dan, thank you.

Why can I not conduct? - I am Pastor Hummel. - Never mind, never mind! Here, here, here in the middle. Or no! At the head end! Mother, we carry you, wherever you want. Light… as a feather. Could we sit next to you, Mother? Sit where you like. Dieter, we have seated you next to the ladies from the choir. This is my place.

Dear Ms. Mom Ladies and Gentlemen, dear family! 80 years! 80 years experience, of which 47 years of marriage were the best. This is new to me. Anyway… So… Hedwig and I, we in our 6-years of courtship have saved up for each other and now for so many years awarded daily by our harmonic stay together, help each other and… Uh, yes. Husband and wife are… Or this: Men and women complement each other. If I may name it frankly. Without Hedwig I wouldn't be that, and Hedwig… if we have once mistakenly different opinions, we specially love us. I think it is clear… - Listen! Hedwig! What I wanted to say We could be proud of each other. Our sympathy goes to all couples, to which the blessing is not granted Perhaps he will finally say cheers to me. Prost! - She live long… - There will be no singing. Now my pocket fell down! I could not reach it. My husband prepared for Mother's Birthday. You and your husband, this milky bread, you are so wonderful, it chokes me in the neck! - No, how vulgar! - May I help you, dear? Perhaps they even appear again. Mother asks when you come up for dinner again. Renate said some very nasty about us. When it comes to a relationship between a man and woman, we don't make jokes, And if Renate is so naughty, she will have a problem. - Dear People… - We have always noticed, - That your marriage is lacking fire. - Internal fire. Tjaha! That is missing. And unfortunately, we lack even your intimate "help-each-other". This wonderful and yet so modest fortune. And that cheerful, The happy base for a harmonious coexistence. - Hedwig… Listen? Hedwig! - Did you hear that, mother? Hedwig, the mayor speaking to you! Hedwig, you are the hottest what I ever met between Heringsdorf and Borkum. Mr. Lütje, did you just say very obscene words! The mayor wanted to make me happy. I do not agree. And we never have different opinions. Then please follow my opinion. - Do you belong to the family? - No. I apologize for the shamelessness of my wife? "They talk to him, she sang to him, "Then she felt for him. "half she dragged him, half he sank in" "An were never seen again" What's next? Nothing more. Between us there is something broken! You have taken away the innocence of our relation! What? The last part I have not understood. Did you just now actually were talking to me? No, I have only talked to myself. But now you said something. - I dont know what. - You said that you had only talked to yourself - Yes. - Of course. Pastor! Please say something. My dear friends… What a wonderful celebration! - but no one is listening. and no clue of women How do you know whether I can conduct or not? I dont care if you can or not. Something I miss on you. I'm not sure what. Hedwig, you are the hottest, what I ever… Shall I serve the pear Helene? - What is that? - Heinrich! This is an apple compote with whipped cream. Two times. Could it be that I… that I myself recently - Not always very… - Yes. What if I would pay more effort… No, Heinrich, please! Don't. There should be a manual to handle such cases. A policy or something. What about if we together start something? What should we start? Something reasonable. Meaningful! It has to be meaningful!
