There is nothing happening between me and Crystal Nothing? Then why did she wechat you during mid-night? She said she misses you, and you replied missing her too? Why did you peep in my phone I asked you why you peeped in my phone Yes! I did peep in your phone - Why did you peep in my phone - But I... ...rather I didn't Did you have sex with Crystal? - No - You did How many times do I need to explain to you I will not trust you, because you did No, I didn't - You did! Go away - I didn't - You did - There are a lot of people around, don't act like this Karman I didn't, I really didn't I tried my very best already I do whatever you asked me to do We have been together for so many years do you think I am blind on what you have done You think I am stupid Go away Karman, let's go back together Hey! Take a look at this, they are quarreling they are quarreling The guy has cheated on his girlfriend, and now she found out The girl cries so badly, such a poor thing If I was the guy I will definitely admit my mistake and apologize first It is such a shame to quarrel like this in public If I was the girl I will give him a hard slap on his face and walk away I won't be fighting with him on the street Maybe the girl is still around because she is waiting for her boyfriend to say sorry That is called stupidity What's next after he apologizes Do you think he will remain loyal to his girlfriend after this? Once you have cheated, you are always a cheater Well, not everyone is the same Some people change after they have once made a mistake There maybe half out of ten who will change Hey, are you ready to go? They have all arrived! Yes, I thought you still want to watch I don't trust you, and I will never trust you again, never ever - I don't trust - Karman! Listen to me please I don't want to Yeah! Let's eat Miss Lily why you lost so much money last month? What happened It can't be I worked everyday, I didn't even take a break You didn't open the store for 4 days last month I worked everyday, maybe I forgot to put it down Let me go back and check later Take a look at this yourself There isn't any input or output from the 26th to 29th Lily, have you forgotten you went to Korea for Big Bang concert on the 26th to 29th I went to the travel agency to arrange flight tickets and hotel rooms for you I even upgraded them No, I didn't go You must remember it wrongly I won't get it wrong!

Do you still need sometime to think? No, I don't I will say it once again I will not sell the shop unless I am dead Moreover you don't understand things between me and your dad No one will understand how a mistress could stupidly waited a guy for decades, yet still hoping he will come back for her Are you still young?

Does she want to be with you again Shh When did I have sex with her? I didn't Do not try to cover shit up with your excuses Otherwise why are you mentioning about her suddenly now I am helping her to find places She is happily married now Wives are the best I warned you, do not let your wife know otherwise you will be dead Of course I know telling you is the worst choice I have made I felt so stupid now Hey, what is wrong with Bo's face Did she get tan Why she always look so grumpy I told her many times I have asked her not to bring stress back from work But she said she is used to it To deal with women like this you need to be dominating the relationship you need to voice out once you feel uncomfortable Just say it Just say it straight in front of her Just saying You got to use some trick dealing with your wife Whatever she says, you need to reject all her ideas, always say no I am serious! You need to be more dominant Are you sure this works Of course Honey have you finish talking We have made a reservation for dinner Yes Madam I thought you just taught me to reject everything she said and always say no Well, as I am a coward, I don't want you to be the same We have been married for 10 years, we can't change now Do you know what marriage is for men It is a life imprisonment So rather be terribly treated you need to fight for yourself Reserve your dignity Stay strong buddy, don't give up Keung has never changed throughout these years he is still like a little kid Well, nothing can be changed He always talks about figures, games and soccer throughout these years But, he seems really scared of you Scared of me Sometimes as a woman, you got to be softer in appropriate times Take it easy Just let them make some decisions guys will then think that they are strong After all, they just want to act smart in front of us You still need to be smart in order to act like one No one said you need to let him to take charge of your whole company You just got to give him some compliment from time to time Haven't you have a dog before It's just like petting your dog and say good boy When you say good boy, it really seems to behave better Sigh, we are married for 10 years now, something can never be changed Marriage is women's lifelong career Everyday you have new skills to learn if you don't perform well, then you just have to correct it until you can You need to be with this man for your whole life, surely you wish he can pamper you for the rest of your life Do you still need to work after dinner Of course, this job is killing me Maybe you should quit Quit Are you going to take care of me Or are you going to pay the home mortgage yourself? When can we finish paying off the mortgage We will be 60 years old when we finish paying off the mortgage By then we can't do anything else Alright then Since you love me so much, how about you pay for my trip to ski in Switzerland this Christmas The farthest place we have been to so far is Hokkaido I felt like we should travel out of Asia - Do you have time to go - Of course if you are paying I can go back and take leave immediately You said that everytime but in the end you will say you have a lot work to do and you don't have time to go on a holiday Not when someone is paying for me to go Switzerland I can even quit my job in order to go You say so! I can get us two tickets in the coming 2 days Fantastic Morning Auntie LAN Why are you so late? I have got a plane to catch You are leaving today You can't go Auntie LAN I thought you have someone to replace you? Where is that person I brought her here today! - Yan, come - Yes this is my niece Yan Yan, this is your boss - Boss - You can call me Keung Brother Keung Have you work in a real estate before Nope! How about jobs related to this field You are being ridiculous I sell vegetables in a market before, but you still hire me - She has talent, - Indeed she can slowly learn I just need to know more about her I have a lot of special skills I got lots of prizes, I can show them all to you immediately What's that Second runner-up in 2nd Beijing daze game What's that I tried my very best do you know those who got the champion and the first runner-up one of them is in a coma, the other one has Alzheimer They are too hard to beat But I am defeated gloriously Auntie LAN, you cannot leave She really is very talented There are very few people like her nowadays I purposely introduce her to you I got to go to the airport now See you later Auntie LAN! I don't allow you to go If you go I will fire you - ByeBye - you won't get your retirement pension Brother Keung! You don't have to worry I will work hard I should give a big thanks to Auntie LAN What kind of magic do you know You don't believe? I can show you one now - Good, I'm waiting - I will not fail this time Look carefully at this ball I will put this ball on my palm and when I do, it will become bigger Don't blink your eyes Yan Auntie, why are you suddenly back Don't play that magic What? You already did Alright then, I am leaving now - Bye - Auntie LAN, are you really leaving I already said my weakness is having very good memory Pick those balls up quickly and go give out leaflets on the streets later It depends on how many people you have as our venue can hold a large amount of people We can put it this way or that way we can decide when you confirm the numbers of people Still working? Jac I have something need to ask you, can you give me a minute? Come this way What do you want to talk about Are you planning to go on a trip Yes! I just booked tickets I am planning to go Switzerland with my husband to ski during Christmas You are going to Switzerland too What do you mean? I haven't been to Switzerland before My husband always blames me I am busy at work. He kept on complaining these days so I promise him I will go on a trip with him this Christmas But honestly, you know how busy we are during that time of the year how can I just walk away exactly! We are always very busying at the end of year what should we do if you are away during that time Luckily I have you You have been working for us for many years, you are always in control of everything at work So I have decided to pass greater power to you Then I can go on holiday Bo, the company relies on you now Don't worry, I will raise your salary too Switzerland is a really beautiful place, have you been there before NO When you have time you should go But I think you are probably difficult to get day offs now Indeed Did you have something to say just now Yes, but I forgot already That's funny tell me when you remember then Okay Honey! Why are you back so early today? Are you hungry? Shall we cook together? Let's go out for dinner! Good idea! Come and take a look. I went shopping today and noted a lot of things are on sales! I'm smart, I quickly bought a lot of stuffs for our trip otherwise we will be in rush if we buy them right before our trip also they might not have discounts by then You see, this matches you a lot! I've got one for myself too! Besides I looked up the air tickets and hotel packages on the internet Anyway I think we should book in advance, it will be cheaper if we confirmed earlier! Shall we go during summer holiday? How can we ski during summer? You didn't ask for annual leave? Of course not! I did But do you know what's the funniest part? Today when I was going to tell my boss about our trip he suddenly told me she is planning to go Switzerland to ski during the same time! what a co-incidence She even said she will let me take in charge of the whole company while she is away so it is difficult for me to tell her I wanted day off But let's think on the brighter side, this might be a good thing if I get control of the whole company while she is away, that means I got promoted Although we can't go on holiday during that time it is still something to celebrate for right? So after all, your job is still the most important I did not say we will never be going on holiday, just not this year We can't go ski this year, we can still go diving under the sun in Maldives next year By then you will say you are busy again But next time I will be smarter I won't be buying all the swimming suits and hats and wasting all my money like a fool What kind of attitude is that? You seem to act like I purposely lied to you about this trip No one asked you to buy everything in advance, why can't you just wait till my annual leaves are confirmed, then we can plan the trip together? Yes! It is my fault again thought you wanted to go on a holiday I want you to be happy, so I quickly get everything prepared in advance! It is my fault, I should not be in rush for all these But who say she can definitely take day offs? You always say you are the only one who plans but you have never included me in all your plans! Can you be a bit more considerate? That is my boss, I am just an employee! So I should ask my boss not to go on holiday and let me go, because my husband is the most important? Whatever Your work is always your first priority I think we should stop arguing I will refund all the things tomorrow! I need get change and go jogging now Why do you need to go out to jog? We got this expensive treadmill machine and you never use It is healthy to go outside and sweat while jogging Doing exercise does not work with turning on the air-con and watch Korean dramas at the same time! I don't think that is a problem! You are just being ridiculous, I still sweat a lot while using the treadmill machine! Things always look the same, but there're actually different! Whatever, you won't understand anyway! Boss! Boss why you go running during late nights? What are you doing? Do you practice Kung Fu during late nights? no way, I am practicing hard on my skills Do you want me to play a magic for you right now? No thanks! I need continue with my jogging! Since you are here, take a seat first! Give me some support please! I promise, I won't miss this time! Then just do a quick one No problem! Watch closely! Haha! Am I smart? I still got another one watch out! Why it didn't work? Exactly, why? Damn it! Boss! Can you help me call the police? No way. Why do you need to call the police? What can I do? You see! Relax! Maybe you've got the steps wrong Take a look in here See, it is out! Did you forget the words? What words? Mar-Li-mar-Li-hom! Oh my god boss! How did you do that? I don't want to lie to you, I actually know this trick since I am grade 3! Boss, I admire you Can you teach me magic? I won't teach my skills to other people Boss! If you are willing to give me two months of your salary. I can teach you straight away. I can even teach you one more trick! Are you insane? Don't act like a girl, teach me immediately I really want to learn, I really admire you Boss! Have you think of joining me in the magic competition? No, I am going to embarrass the neighborhood! Why? I worked very hard on my magical skills Although I don't have much talent, but I always try my very best Why do you like magic so much? Because my mum is a magician! Your mum is a magician and yet you are not talented? If I was your mum, I will be very disappointed My mum got a serious sickness when I was very young at that time she couldn't even get out of bed My dad asked me to play magic for her everyday, so she won't feel so boring I still remember my mum used to have a lot of notes about magic I learned one by one read every single page Everytime I played magic, my mum would smile happily At that time I thought I played very well, Now then I realized I actually played poorly, and so my mum laughed at me But I didn't regret learning magic Because I know I brought happiness to my mother during the last few years of her life Therefore boss, if you are willing to join the competition with me We will definitely win Please don't drag me into this, I am old already I don't like competitions You can put some makeup on to make you look younger I thought of a great magic for both of us but you need to be my assistant Are you joking? I am your boss, why should I be your assistant I need to get going, please help me throw this away, can't eat anymore I need to continue with my jogging, just remember to be on time at work tomorrow! Don't go There are lots of people around, - this is Central! - So what? Quickly go back, continue practicing Knowing I hate red bean soup Should have bought fungus sweet soup back, stupid! Your fungus sweet soup is here! Why are you hiding behind my back, did you do something wrong? I know when my wife would want to eat when she is mad And when she is really angry, she will definitely want to eat something sweet! This is yours! That is mine Let's eat together What How come Okay, I will come right now What happened My sister is in hospital now! Do not try to move those heavy stuff next time What happened if you injure yourself again next time Bella Sister?

Don't fool around with me Sis, I wasn't joking I planned to announce this news when you two arrived Me and Bella are going to be parents soo Aren't you happy for us You can't even take care of yourself, you are jobless Are you two insane? Have you guys clear up your minds? Is there something wrong with your brain? - Go home with me right now! - Bo, just calm down first, we are on the streets - Let go of me - Take it easy, there are people around Go home and talk to mum with me Let go What happened?

Let me introduce, he is your daddy Bobby I am starving Let's eat, why aren't you guys eating? Really? That's awesome Cheers I am really happy to come back this time! I can't believe I am going to be a grandfather Why do you come back suddenly? I miss you guys, I wanted to come back to see you all I am asking, what is your main purpose to come back Bo, your dad has already answered you! He misses us all, that's why he came back for us Miss us? Suddenly? So where has he been for the past 10 years? Did he think that we were dead? Bo! Your dad always wanted to come back he just couldn't before He has his reasons I know, you must be a warranted criminal! After all these years, probably the police are no longer finding you, so you can get a fake passport and smuggle your way back to Hong Kong now! you are so cool I couldn't come back as my wife didn't allow me to before Miss Lily! You see! The man you have been waited for all these years eventually has a wife Have you finally realize how stupid you are I knew he has a wife since the first day I know him, it doesn't bother me What have he given you? Why did you become so stubborn and stupid He is obviously fooling you around Bo I didn't lie to your mum at all, I do truly love her Is that true? Alright, if you can get a divorce immediately then come back and marry my mum I will believe you This is between me and your dad, it is none of your business None of my business? I have been helping you for everything All these years, how many times did I help you with your mess? I have been helping you with the place you are staying the shop you are running and even the men your dated Now you tell me it is non of my business? On the other hand, I really don't need your care Since young, you have never taught me on my homework Even when I was sick, you asked our neighbor to bring me to see the doctor You didn't even find schools for me I need to work and earn money to support you two at that time I am been supportive with all your decisions all these years I see you as a friend, don't you feel happier with such relationship? A friend? I can get to know friends if I go drinking in LAN Kwai Fong! I need a mother! I need a mother who cares about me, do you understand? Actually I have a good news to announce Me and Bella have decided to get married Give me an applause please Who approve on your marriage? Sister, you wouldn't want the baby to have no father, this will be really pathetic When the baby is born, we will take care by ourselves This is better than having a useless father, he will just be a burden Besides, our family are used to have no father Even you disagree I will still marry this man! Why is your hand bandaged? You hurt your brain You are only 24 years old, you will definitely regret if you get married now You get married when you were 24 years old too, are you regretting now? We are different Anyway if you want to marry this useless man, I will definitely disagree You said we are different right? So whatever I decided now, it is none of your business Bella Whatever you want, mom will always support you! Great! You are a grown-up now. But the day you get married, please don't invite me! I will not come Honey, where are you going? Please don't follow me, I don't need you! Don't be like that! Let's go back it is very impolite to just walk away You can go back if you want Your dad has finally come back, let's just have dinner happily together What for being so grumpy at him at all times? I haven't complain about your attitude why didn't you say a thing when I object my sister's idea of getting married? This is your family matter, I don't know how to get involve you are my husband! can't you say something to agree with me You just sat there and eat If you wish, you can go back and carry on with your dinner Honey, your sister is pregnant now and most importantly her boyfriend is willing to take up the responsibility They even planned on getting married, and your parents have also agreed with their decision So why should we disagree I have mentioned this many times! Her boyfriend is useless, if Bella marry him, her life will be miserable! Why don't you guys get it? Bella is a grown-up now, she can make decisions of her own! She can get a divorce if anything goes wrong in the future! At least this is her own choice She is not your sister, of course you can say that! Everyone is the same, you all simple come for me when you needed help! Honey, relax! You don't have to take control of everything, right? Relax What do you mean by taking control of everything! They are my family! What are you suggesting now? Are you saying I am dominating you and you feel miserable now? I didn't, I didn't mean that you are always like a coward whenever I scolded you just like your dad, Hey, you can comment on me but you can't comment on my father I mentioned it several times already, you can be unhappy but you can't criticize about my family Have I said anything wrong? I am only stating the truth I really don't understand you, you are just different from your family! Your mother and sister are both nice, but why are you always so grumpy? You kept on criticizing and scolding people all the time! Are you too used to using such attitude towards your colleagues? We are not your workmates we don't get paid to get scolded by you You like them a lot right? They are all nice people you like to act like a good guy You all are such a perfect match, you can go back to have dinner with them I picked all those by myself! These are the best I'm sure there will be something that fits you! What do you think? Any particular one you like? If yes I can give a call to the landlord immediately, we can go and give a look anytime! How about you give me all their information first I wanted to show my husband! He is not around these few days, I think it is best to let him decide Sure, is he always not around? Are you bored? He is very busy at work Besides I am very independent, as you know I know for sure, is he treating you well? I won't choose him if he isn't! Why? You seem worried about me! You will do the same too right? We are friends, of course we care about each other Hey, you can't eat peanuts! You still remember about my allergy to peanuts? Are you still allergic to them? I will always be, this is genetic! My dad is allergic to peanuts too! Oh you haven't see my daughter before right? Let me show you my daughter's picture! She looks cute! - Hey - Hi - why are you off so early today? - Yes Ceci? God mother! - What are you doing? - Homework Such a good girl! - Where's Min? - In the kitchen! Alright, continue with your homework! You're here! Can you help me wash the things in the basket please? Sure! What happened to your husband? Why he looks so annoyed? Maybe he is just too tired! By the way, why you suddenly decided to join us for dinner today? Where's Keung? Don't mention about him, I don't want to see him! You two fight again? You two should grow up and stop having cold wars He kept driving me mad and he won't apologize. He always think he is right! By the way, you said you were sick and end up went the doctor's 2 weeks ago? You even said you did a brain scan How was it? Is the report back? Doctor said I have a tumor inside my brain, and it is a malignant tumor! Don't joke about this, are you crazy? I wish... But it is fine, I am arranged a schedule already! I will start chemotherapy next month the doctor said there is a new medication for me to try! It will be harsh at the beginning, but I have faith in myself! Tumors are always very tricky they will fool you more if you think too negatively! So I am not scared, I will fight against this tumor! And you will always be there for me right? Mr. Cheung? Haven't I arranged a time to meet up with you and Miss Ho to check on the venue's decoration a few days later? Our sketch is not ready yet! I am here to cancel the wedding! People think Cherrie has a good marriage, but she herself thinks I am not good for her What do you mean? Cherrie will get marry in Paris next month as she wishes! Her wedding will be held on the Tower Eiffel with fireworks around! She said this is what she mean by true happiness I think this is her fate, she is just not lucky enough to be your wife! I've heard a lot of similar comforting words for the past 3 days already Sorry! But never mind, according to our policy, the deposit you've paid before will still be valid within a year's time. And for the white color roses that you pre-ordered, we can use them for your next wedding we can even change to another kind for you for free! Good, I need to try harder to find a wife then! But anyway, I'm sincerely sorry Sorry to bother you for canceling my wedding - Sorry - Don't be silly! Don't say that it is our pleasure to help you!

Kiss you, I kissed you because I like No other meaning, do you? I have a wife I know That means you feel something It was such a success today Shall we go celebrate together? I am off to France to learn magic tomorrow night Tonight is your last night seeing me Let's go I had a lot of girlfriends before So I'm those men who want to get any girls they met But even I had lots of girlfriends before I am still a lonely person now, look at me I did think about what I have done before Maybe there were a lot of girls who truly loved me before Yet I didn't cherish them, so they left me I then said to myself No matter what my next girlfriend is, I will still truly love her So you mean Miss Ho is a retribution? At first she is, she has bad temper when she treats me badly I don't feel that guilty I thought that will be it for the rest of my life yet God still decided to give me a second chance things are quite funny sometimes Alright then, I will you can find someone who truly loves you and cherishes you Can I date you again? I am married True girls like you, who has a good heart and appearance, it is impossible for you to be single I am so stupid I feel glad for your husband I think I am good, and so do I Seems like you have something to say Is it really good to get marry? Don't know why many people are looking forward to get married I just don't understand Why, do you regret? What are you doing? That's so wrong! Fine, I am not playing with you Hello? Honey?

I will miss you Enough, this is enough Why it has no response even I kept pressing it No problem, I come fix it now I can go up and find the instruction guide "Kiki" I can't find, but don't worry I can call someone to come and fix it tomorrow Honey, come and take a look I just read something interesting on Facebook They say there are 5 symptoms when your husband is cheating on you, do you want to hear it out? Of course not, you can never trust posts on Facebook Why not, I think it has its point Let me see There it goes Okay, firstly He always miss his wife's calls I didn't, whenever you call, I will surely pick up Secondly When you call him, he will always say: I'm busy, I can't talk right now This one yes But you say more than I do Okay, third never brings his wife to social activities or introduce her to his friends Well, you know all my friends You are the one who never bring me to meet your friends Seems like I will embarrass you Fourthly Purposely cover his phone, worries that others will see who is calling him Don't pin on the innocent, good man I didn't purposely cover my phone Is that all? I shall go up and take a shower Still got one more which is having once or more than once cheating experiences I think it is quite true, what do you think? I don't think so, I am going up Who's Kiki? What? I said who is Kiki, stop pretending Why do I need to pretend She is a client I am helping her to find places Why does she has such a intimate name? When I went to work in Shanghai, she was my intern I met her again recently on the streets She said she needs to find houses, so I help her So she is the one whom my friend saw you were holding hands with in Shanghai New Town Plaza? Here you come again, I said it many times Your friend was mistaken, I didn't hold her hand So it is the same one She is already married, her daughter is already 6 years old Even she is married doesn't mean you two have nothing with each other Are your period coming soon? I haven't finish Who is the girl with you on the streets that night? What did you say? I said who is the girl chatting and laughing with you on the streets that night? I called you And there was a girl beside you, but you said you were alone She is auntie Lan's niece Auntie LAN is on holiday and she is not in Hong Kong So she asked someone to replace her at work and that's her niece just that simple Then why don't you say it that night Because I don't want you to think wrongly So I won't now? Wong Chi Keung, after all these years, you still have the same taste for women Before it is your ex tutor Then it is your office intern Now there is a colleague's niece What is it called? They are just easy for you to get What do you mean by easy to get Can you saying things so ugly You know it is ugly right Do you still remember I am your wife I already said there is nothing between me and Yan Yan? There is nothing or there hasn't been anything yet What about Kiki? She is calling you, do you want to answer it now? How about you? What Who is the guy who was shopping with you that night Which guy? So now it is your turn to pretend I said my words are not trustworthy right? But at least I picked up your call How about you You didn't even pick up my call He is my client Is there a problem if I have dinner with a client You've made a mistake and now you are trying to blame me back? Women always have double standards seeing themselves and others You can have dinner and watch movie with other people Yet I am always a suspect for you to be suspicious about Mr. Wong Don't forget you had once cheated on me So because I had once cheated on you before, I need to follow you like a dog now? I am your husband, I am not a criminal You are my wife, you are not a judge Do you still remember Can you stop shouting at me? Being loud doesn't mean you are right Right is right and wrong is wrong Now you are wrong, so stop finding excuses for yourself Aren't you shouting now? You kept on digging at the past How can we continue to be together if we kept on fighting If you can't continue, then let's divorce You wanted to say that right? You know me well, you can't take it back once you've said it You are insane Where are you going? I am not finished You always find places to hide everytime Wong Chi Keung, I tell you You couldn't fool me 10 years ago, you can't fool me now too I lied because I love you Otherwise how can we be together for 10 years Do you think it is very easy to be with you? I am a difficult person to be with, so you feel tired now right? let's get divorce Do you really want to get divorce? yes, I do You really want to get divorce so badly? yes I did held her hand in New Town Plaza, your friend wasn't wrong So you want a divorce now? Since you are being so honest Then I shall tell you a secret too Do you know why didn't we have kids for so many years It wasn't supposed to be 10 years ago, you have a chance to be a father Yet you got together with Josephine I hated you So I went for abortion What did you say? I don't believe you I don't believe you I didn't tell you all these years Simply because I am waiting, waiting for a day when you said you don't love me anymore, when you want to leave me I will tell you this secret I want you to regret for the rest of your life You can hate me, yet you will also hate yourself I don't believe I promised I will love you unconditionally Be proud of you and respect you Try my very best to take care of you Comfort and protect you in difficult times and growth with you together in love always be loyal and pamper you for the rest of my life I now legally announce Wong Chi Chung and Lu Ka Min, husband and wife Thank you I haven't been jogging with you for awhile, why did you become so physically poor your muscles are smaller too I am not bad, you are just too strong now You don't have to be so strong man, are you joining a competition soon? If I don't become stronger, how can I take care of my wife and daughter How's Min Didn't you say they changed a new medicine last time? Is there any improvement Take it easy, you need to hand in there Min needs you now Did I tell you Min fainted on the street the other day I rushed to the hospital the doctor said to me: Sir, I need to be prepared We found out your wife has brain cancer and it has reached the end stage You need to go and prepare her for hospital administration now He kept on saying I went deaf, I can't hear a thing he said after awhile, I suddenly remember I need to pick my daughter up from school so I immediately drove to her kintergarden When I got to my car, I suddenly remember my dad used to say to be while I was a kid There are three things in life that brings happiness to a man get promoted, become rich and having a dead wife After being married for all these years I can't stand her sometimes You know women likes to get control of everything, they are very annoying when I got so mad sometimes I did imagine how wonderful if I never get married with her Now when she has cancer and going to die soon I think again If she passes away, what is going to happen with my daughter and me? I miss my wife badly Have a drink I'm fine I tell myself Hang in there, right? I can't fall, it will be terrible if I fall My dad has some classmates who are doctors They are quite famous How about you bring Min to get a second opinion? Bo gave Min the contacts already She didn't tell you? Your dad knows too You two still fighting? Don't be like that, you two are married for 10 years already What for creating a big fuss now? If you don't love her, you will have the courage to get a divorce straight away What for having such cold wars, you think you are still a teenager? She is the one who wanted a divorce, so let it be Do you know what you are saying? You sure you don't miss a thing? She took my child away but you cheated on her too So then she has the right to abort my child? I am not judging who is right or wrong here If now there is a moment that Min will be fine I wouldn't mind even if she tells me she had an affair before, Look at me, I am an example Things are so unpredictable in this world Bro, you can't fight against God, but you can fight against yourself Don't make things worse, you will regret for what you have done Just be happy together as a couple Where should I put them? Here? Give it to me I bought a lot of new clothes for Ceci First season Second season That's a lot of clothes?! You don't understand Kids grow very fast, soon these won't fit anymore Besides, I don't know if I still have any chance to buy new clothes for her in the future Are you okay? take a seat first Are you ok? Can you help with something? Are you ready? yes Start Ceci, Mommy wants to tell you something very important I know if I said it now, you probably won't understand But I know, you will understand in the future Ceci, you are so beautiful There surely will be a lot of people who want to date you in the future But remember, you don't need to rush in and pick someone at the beginning As a girl, you should try on a few relationships choose slowly, it will never be too late But you must know how to protect yourself find someone who respect you, understand? If you have a chance to meet someone like your father It is not a bad choice Your father is a good man It is worth marrying him Also, you need to make some true friends Like your mother, I don't have much friends But I am lucky enough to meet someone like your god-mothering, who loves me dearly Maybe one day your Dad will bring a woman home He might want you to call her Mommy If you think she is kind to you and good with Daddy I don't mind you calling her Mommy But just remember not to get mad at Daddy It is because without me being by his side He must be very upset like you Therefore, I wish He can find someone who loves him and can stay with him until he grows old I know Ceci is a very good girl you wouldn't want Daddy to be alone right? Ceci When Mommy is gone, you can miss me but don't be too upset Do you remember when you were two, three years old Mommy still need to go to work, and you often wouldn't let me leave home You said to me, you miss me a lot Do you remember what did mommy say to you? I said Silly girl, you don't have to miss mommy, I will always be in your heart Right? So remember, Mommy will never want to leave you If there is another life, I still wish to be your mother and you still need to be my darling girl, will you? Ceci, I love you Bye Can you help me? I don't want to die I don't want to leave them Can I don't die? What do you want? Any recommendations? How about Pig offals? You can eat that alone or go with noddles Pig offals are very oily Keung? Dad? You haven't had dinner? Take a seat Sit together Why are you here? Mom said you need to stay behind for school meeting, so she didn't cook and went to play Mahjong You called mom? Gosh, that's bad Why are you so scared? Did you sneak out? Shu, don't let your mum know Or else I am dead Are you serious? Pork offals See, there it is Just a bowl of noodles, is there something wrong?

Don't tell me you two are in a marriage crisis This happens when you get married for long At the beginning, you need to understand each other It is important that you know what she likes to eat, what she likes to wear She will be happy when you compliment to her As time goes by, you cannot say you understand women why If you got one thing wrong you are putting yourself to a death penalty, there is no way to return to life After all it is just about tolerance However you still need to give yourself some space to feel the freedom around you then you two will still be happily in love at home Son You are someone's husband now don't tell me you don't know this I know Have you decided on what you want to eat Same as him, pork offals noodles please Dad, let's drink Sure Don't tell your mum you saw me Of course Mom, why are you here Relax, it was just a joke - Two large beers please - Ok Let's eat You first This is good Pork offals are famous here Bo You are so on time You think I am you?

No thanks By the way, when did you started to jog on the streets How did you know that? You haven't block my Facebook I got bored using the treadmill for too long So I try jogging outside And I find it quite nice to go jog outside After awhile when the weather gets cooler, it will be nicer Do you still remember the couples we saw quarreling in Tsim Sha Tsui? What about them? They got married How do you know? They came to our office to get advice with their wedding I got a video tape, let me show you I can't believe they got married after the big fight They were very sweet at the wedding Seems like things are hard to say after all They will be together if they're meant to be Do you need to call your taxi driver? He might not show up just call another one He won't, I know him well He wouldn't stood me up How well you know him? I called him 10 years ago and said If you don't show up now, my wife will get a divorce with me The next day he called me and asked how things went I said: luckily, we are still together And from then on, I will always find him when I need a ride So we become friends You never mentioned this before I am not you, I don't keep on reminding myself of those unhappy things Are you criticizing me being vengeful? Isn't that obvious? Since when? Alright, good bye My car is arriving, told you he will not stood me up Shall I give you a ride? Hello? Yes, I am waiting for you there Yes, alright. Thanks My driver will be here in a minute Don't eat too much hamburgers, they are too oily and unhealthy You didn't block my Facebook either If that couples can be together again Do you think we can too? What did you just say? Can you give us another chance? Do you think we can? You think we can't? This is different from last time It won't be that easy Shall we just say things out clearly once and for all Am I really that difficult to be with? Yes you are If I am such a difficult person, why don't you find another one? It doesn't mean another person must be easy to be with Yes, maybe for the first one or two years Yet it will still be the same afterwards How many people have you been with? You seem to have a lot of experience Having you is more than enough Can you don't say like I scold you every day I don't scold without a reason Yes, I had been very stress at work for the past few years I am very irritable and always get mad at you But if I don't, who else should I be mad at? if I made you unhappy then sorry Talking about sorry I have to apologize to you for many more times I did many wrong things before But if possible Can you promise me If we fight badly in the future Can you allow me to sweet talk you give me a chance to apologize? I really don't want to wake up every morning and realize that you are not by my side Do you think I want to eat alone? If the one who is eating with me isn't you I rather eat alone Do you think we can wipe out everything about the past - And be together again? - Yes Why are you so sure? Even though we cannot forget everything We can still learn to accept Accept? or tolerate It is a pain to tolerate What do you mean We can say "I tolerate you" rather than "I love you" in the future then I love you is easy to say Who can't But you really need to be able to tolerate a person in order to say that If you are in love with a person, you got to tolerate him You will still tolerate because you still love him I don't know how long can I tolerate Then just try until you can't Shall we just let God to decide If your taxi comes first, then you can decide our future If mine comes first, then I got to make the decision Fine Excuse me Honey, I got held up by the meeting just now Don't worry I am very hungry, have you ordered anything?
