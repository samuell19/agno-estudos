I'll be 18 tomorrow. You were 17 when you had me. I don't want you making the same mistakes that I did. Mom, you just don't know how wonderful he is. Oh, how romantic. You have to start thinking about more practical things, Melissa. Jobs, for instance. Rick has a job and he's gonna join the Air Force. And where does that leave you? Chasing after him at air bases all over the place? You need something more stable, Melissa. We'll work it out, okay? Rick! What now? Rick! What? Look at this place. RICK: It's great.

Treat yourself. [MOM LAUGHING] Mom? Melissa, where have you been? Mom, I need to talk to you. Honey, can't it wait? I'm with someone. Never mind. We'll talk tomorrow, okay, sweetheart? [SIGHS] [CHUCKLING] Oh, Morales, Morales... You know something? You were the one kid I thought had cut this gangbanging bullshit. Tell me, what is the fascination? Is it the shirts? They killed my cousin. Who did? [SCOFFS] Come on, Ricardo. Help us gather information so we can put these guys behind bars. Where's your family loyalty? Doesn't work that way, man. I see.

See, those outfits they wear, they look like dog shit. Now, you should talk to 'em about designing them something new, something elite. I'm not ready to talk to anybody. Sure you are.

Have you heard anything about Melissa? No. She hasn't been around in a long time. It's over now. It's better that way. [STUDENTS CHATTERING] Come in, Melissa. Sit down. Melissa, I'm very disappointed in you. Your grades, your attendance, even your appearance. I feel it's only fair to warn you if you continue on this course, you might not graduate. I'm kind of having a rough time right now. I'm worried about you. Look, I know your social life is none of my business, but I've always thought of you as a special student. My main concern is that you get back on track. Do you think you can do that? Yeah. Now if you need anything from me, please don't be afraid to ask. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] What are you doing? This is why all the changes in you? You have no right snooping around in my room! This is dangerous, Melissa! Mind your own business, Mother! Look at you! You're a mess, a drug addict!

You insult me by making me come here. You're not crazy enough to hold out on me, are you B.T.? You been losing your grip? No, Mr. Steadman. You been smoking too much and moving too little, huh? You lost a whole shipment. Leaving me with the financial burden. Now, how do you propose to make up for that, B.T.? Mr. Steadman, I'll take care of it, okay? Don't worry, all right.

I'm going to Hawaii, man. They got some bad-ass women in Hawaii. They all waiting for me on the beach, you know. I never been there, but I know how it is. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Fuck this place, man. I'm going by Vegas first and win me a couple thousand dollars. Yeah, buddy. I got me some fine women waiting for me there. Sit the fuck down! So, cholo, what time is it? Where's Steadman? Hey, you talk to me, I talk to Steadman. I talk to Steadman only. Take a fucking walk, Rick. All right, homes. I'll take my business somewhere else. Yeah, you do that. You got it, blood. Hey, motherfucker! Bring your ass over here now. Get your fucking feet down! I heard you jumped B.T. out. You heard right.Why? I got connections.Bullshit. B.T. don't got connections.Hey. It's cool. B.T. don't got connections. See, I got people that pay me up front, cash. I'll tell you what. We start you off with a quarter of a bird. You move that shit, we'll talk contract. We don't talk nothing till I talk to Steadman. Listen here, motherfucker. Rick, Rick, Rick. My offer is the best you're gonna get. It's the way we do business. Take it or not. I'll take it. Let's do it. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: I'm a go... Gonna make a beer run! Annie. Annie? Annie? [DISHES FALLING] Annie? Annie, shit. Holy shit, Annie. Shit. No, no, no, no. This is making me very, very nervous. You gotta get close enough to Steadman to finger his secondary source. Hey, I'm doing everything I can. I've been there three times in the last five days. Look, I can't keep an entire tact force on alert much longer. I'm getting too much pressure. It's tough for us to justify these drug buys. What? You got a better idea? We're gonna have a good time tonight, baby. Hmm? Might as well look up here. You know what it's like. Don't you? [CHUCKLES] Come here. Come to your daddy, baby. Come on, baby. Shit, bitch, you stink. When was the last time you had a bath?I don't know. You're just like all the rest of them. You come in looking halfway decent, and next thing you know, you're turning into a goddamn coke freak. Get your ass up here. Come on. Shit. Smelly-ass... Get in here!No! Get your hands down. Get in the shower. Get in there, bitch. [SCREAMING] When Steadman finds out that his drugs are not hitting the street, he's gonna know you're not moving his shit. That'll teach you to keep your ass clean. Let me out! It's burning me!Get back in there. It's hot! Let me out! That's enough for one more buy. But after that, I'm not making any more promises. I'll make it work. I'll make it work. You'd better. [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] Clean as a whistle. Yeah, come with me. You must be Morales. Yeah. And you must be Steadman. Yeah. You like that beer? I thought you'd probably like one of them tortillas and beans, one of them Coronas. This is fine.That's good. 'Cause it could be your last one. Now, cut the shit, Morales. Where's all the stuff you've been buying from us? It sure as hell hasn't hit the streets. Man, you've been talking to the wrong people. Don't give me that "people" bullshit. Now either you're storing it up for your own house or you're working with the badge boys. Either way, I'm not enthused. Tripper. Youngblood, bring me that torch. Here you go. You ever smelled burnt flesh? Foul odor? [GRUNTING] [BEEPING] Yo, boss, the man's coming up the path. He's got the bag. Okay, hit it. Get him in, get him out. He's headed for the back door. I'll find out what you know later. [GROANS] He's not a bad kid. I just hope we haven't sent him to an early grave. Quick, Steadman, weigh it and give me my money. Just relax. We'll be out of here in three minutes. Come on. Come on, let's go. Jesus. This is the last time I come here, Steadman. You do business with me, you do it here in the rock house. Okay? [PHONE RINGING] Tact Force One, here we go. Hit 'em, and hit 'em hard. It's about time.Let's go. Let's get outta here. Let's go. Come on, come on. Oh, shit, it's the pigs! Man, they got the ram with them. They're coming in from all sides! Jesus, what now? Man, fuck you. Ain't no shit, man. This is big! Oh, shit! Red alert! Come on! Hear that? Positions! Move it! Hey, start flushing the drugs! Open the door. I'm getting out. No way, white fuck. [GUN SHOT] Shit, I'm getting the fuck outta here! Freeze! [GUN FIRING][GROANS] Move it, move it! Officer down! Take 'em, man! Blow 'em away!Let's go! [SIRENS WAILING] Dockett? Move it! Move it! Freeze, Dockett! [GROANS] [GRUNTING] OFFICER: Make way for the ram! Rick![GROANS] Man, you're gonna die now, man. Hold it right there! Freeze! Hold it, Morales, don't do it. Don't do it! [DOG GROWLING]Get this motherfucker off me, man! Stay there! Drop the weapon. He's not worth it. Steadman, get out here! Get your hands behind your back, asshole! Good job, Morales. [SOBBING] I'm so glad you're here. You're gonna be all right, honey. We're gonna have to start paying these teachers more money. I was so scared. I never thought I'd make it without you. You're safe now.
