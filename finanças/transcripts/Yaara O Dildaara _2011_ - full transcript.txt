Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Has my grandson woken up? - No, grandma. Why? - Didn't I tell you to wake him up? Karam Singh? - Grandma, sir said.. ...that he will return home late. He went to the golf club with Mr. Randhawa. Good putt, Mr. Sant. Thank you, Mr. Randhawa. Mr. Sandhu, you look very happy today? Yes, my son Sukh has won the award.. ...for the best businessman of the year. What better gift can a father receive.. ...from his son on his birthday? - Absolutely right. Come, let's celebrate. - Sure, sir. Cheers! - Cheers! By the way, Mr. Sandhu, since your son's coming after.. ...receiving an award can | also expect a reward from you? Reward? As you know, Mr. Sandhu, my daughter has completed.. ...her graduation from St. Blaise from Shimla. | had planned that my daughter stays with me.. ...after my retirement so yesterday I got.. ...her admission in the government college.. ...in the finance department. But my daughter wants to take some industrial training.. ...in finance in your factory along with her studies. Now you spoke like a true soldier. Do you need to say this? Ask for something more. Today it's my daughter's first day in her college.. ...your younger son Rajveer is also studying.. ...in the same college tell him to take care of her. No problem, this will also be done. But make sure you come to my party this evening. Sure. Happy birthday again. Good morning, my son. Good morning. Hi, dad! Mom, he's improving day by day. Dear son, haven't you woken up a bit early today? Yes, papa. Yesterday | had four lectures free.. ...and today I have two free lectures. Great, I hope you'll enjoy in college now. Mom, don't forget to offer him some sweets after his breakfast. He has done a great wonder today. Well, I had some important work with you, son. Yes, tell me, father. - Good morning, uncle. Good morning. Good morning. Please be seated. - Thank you, uncle. Thanks. Sit down and taste some breakfast with your friend. No, uncle, I eat only once but if you insist.. ...I'll taste some for company sake. - Okay, no problem. Mr. Kang, I want to tell you something, please don't mind.. ...I didn't understand yours and Rajveer's chemistry. You are a librarian and he's a student. What kind of a friendship is this? In fact, uncle, there's no chemistry between us.. ...there's philosophy between us. You see the BJP government is working alone, right? But when there's a tiff between them.. ...Mr. Badal tries to control the whole matter. Leave him, father, tell me what important work.. ...you have with me? My friend Randhawa's daughter Harleen.. ...has completed her graduation from Shimla.. ...and has taken admission in your college. And you are a very senior student of your college.. ...the girl is new, just see to it.. ...that no senior student troubles her. Don't worry, father, when I'm there.. ...no one will dare to look at Mr. Randhawa's daughter. That's like my boy. This proves how much my son is serious in his studies. Uncle, we take up all our work very seriously. You can assure Mr. Randhawa. Just tell him to pay his daughter's fees regularly.. ...we won't be able to do that. Rest leave everything in our hands. Am I right? Let's go, Mr. Vikram. Actually, uncle was telling to have breakfast.. ...I hope he doesn't mind. No, no. No formalities. If you are getting late.. ...you can have it afterwards. Hurry up! I have arranged heavy lunch for you in the canteen. Alright, uncle. - Bye, father. Bye, grandma. What's wrong with you? Let me have some. Okay, you go and look out for Mr. Randhawa's daughter Harleen. I'll go to the library and have a few words with Chindi. If one has friends like you then there's no need to have enemies. You selfish person. Hello, Ms. Chindi, you have managed to handle.. ...the library work well in my absence I feel now.. ...you must think of handling your household chores too. Leave that. Tell me what am I supposed to do.. ...with those girls and boys who come here for romance? Who romances here? Really? | feel some students have laid eggs over here in the library.. ...they come here running to sit on the eggs. Excuse me, what do you mean by this? You are saying this to whom? | haven't mentioned anybody's name. Only that girl will be annoyed by such a statement.. ...who is romancing here. Kang sir, mind your language! Why don't you fight in Punjabi | have failed in English. Mr. Romeo? Look at yourself before pointing towards others. Look at yourself Mr. Kang and then taunt others. Why is there a cat sitting under my chair? No, it's not a cat. In fact it's Chindi sitting on your seat. He's madly in love with her. Hello, it's up to me where I make her sit. Who are you to challenge my freedom? Then even you cannot challenge our freedom. Stand up. Sand up. You all keep studying. Why are you all looking here? Do your job. If you want to do all this then why don't you go to some mall? Go and sit in a garden. No need to spoil the atmosphere of the library. Come, let's go, it's he who is spoiling.. ...the atmosphere of the library and he's blaming us for it. Scoundrel. - What did you say? Nothing, nothing, come, let's go. Acting smart. You all study. Why are you looking here? Is there some drama going on here? Have made the library a lovers den. Mr. Kang, this is the limit. Think something now. | too feel that | have to decide now. Or else the way we have thrown them out of the library.. ...the principal will throw both of us out of the college. My name is Prabhleen Sandhu. I'll sing Ms. Pooja's song for you. 'Stop whistling and calling me. Stop staring at me' 'Stop staring at me! 'Stop whistling and calling me. Stop staring at me." - Good. Good. And yes, you? - I don't know anything. I'll get married and flee to Canada. He's an NRI quota. Let him go. You can go. I'll go to Canada. I'm Harleen Randhawa and I have done my graduation.. ...from St. Blaise, Shimla. Then please sing us a song sung by Sukhwinder. Sorry. Richie, she's from St. Blaise, Shimla. Why can't she show us an item number like.. 'Sheela ki jawani' or "Munni Badnaam hui' (Hindi film songs)? Yes, so what is your opinion? | can't sing. Richie, then tell her to do "Bhujangasan' (a Yoga posture).. ...which is done by Baba Ramdev. Okay, then, please do it. No, I don't know. What is she saying? Strange, you don't want to sing. Don't want to dance and don't want to do Yogasana as well.. Okay, then, you can kiss any of the senior students you like. | feel she has never done that too. Haven't you kissed anybody till today? It's. Very very easy. Stop it. | say stop it. Rajveer, Richie, stop it. What is this? Rajveer, I'm asking you what is all this? Sir, when law is against ragging.. ...then who is he to rag the new students? Ragging? He was ragging whom? Ask her, sir. Is it, child? - Yes, sir Mr. Richie, I'm suspending you for seven days from this college. And now you get out. But sir.. - I say get out. Please go back to your classrooms. And you too. Excuse me. Thanks. By the way, I'm Harleen. Rajveer. Since your dad had given me this duty.. ...I have fulfilled it. Thanks again. "The atmosphere is happening and I'm very happy."

Sukh is handling your factory and Rajveer is going to complete his studies. I'm not talking about them, mother. You are talking about whom then? I'm talking about Mr. Randhawa's daughter. She was hardly six or seven years old.. ...when I saw her for the first time. Yesterday she was sitting in front of me in the party.. ...and I was couldn't believe that she is the same girl I had seen. If you see anyone so young.. ...and see the same person after so many years,.. .There is a vast difference. The girl is indeed very pretty. Is Mr. Randhawa bad? So son, his daughter will be coming to our factory.. ...to practise finance, please help her. Of course, father, you just command. I'll make her sit on my seat and I'll go and sit on the clerk's seat. Well-said, brother, well-said. Son, no need to be so happy. | don't find you serious in studies.. ...and if you fail.. ...then I'll shut the university gates.. ...and open the factory gates for you. No need to worry about my studies, father. I'm worried about our factory due to the recession. I'll top from the university and make you proud. Let's see. Let's see which way the wind will blow. Come on then, let's go to the factory. Who knows what I will have to face if I fail. Son, the confidence with which you are running the factory.. ...I'm sure you'll never fail. We are blessed to have you in our house. Okay, father. Bye, grandma. - Bye, son. Bye. - Take care. Come soon. - Alright. Here, have hot fried bread with some cold coffee. Have a bite. | say please try my cold drink. Please try this coffee. - Try this. Rajveer, please. Rajveer, tell them not to say all this. She is feeling embarrassed. Don't trouble her. She'll take what she likes. I'm sorry, Rajveer, | forgot to ask you, you are studying in which year? | have completed my studies.. ...and I'm planning to go to London now. - London? This boy is an MBA topper.. ...he is planning to do PhD from Oxford University now. And everybody will call him a doctor after two years. Isn't it? O my God! Are you going to Oxford university to do PhD? It's every student's dream to study from there. It may be, but now I feel | won't be happy going to London. Buddy, please help me too. | will also be able to do MBA. Buddy, how can I teach everybody? It's not easy for me. Can't you study on your own? Neither do you study and nor do you let others study. Please be seated. Not you. Stand-up. Your third semester is still not cleared.. ...and if you fail in the fourth semester.. ...then you will fail even in your MBA too. You just waste your time the whole day. Sir, I had come to collect the books. Do you take the books to study or to tear them? Use the library books carefully. Yes. Yes. I'm also leaving. I'm also leaving. | have to attend my class. There is a student from Oxford University sitting over here. Bye. You also go and look after the library books. Go and check whether the rats are tearing the books. Our matter was getting fixed smoothly, buddy, the principal came and ruined the whole scene. Hi I'm.. I'm Harleen Randhawa. I'm here to meet Mr. Sukhdeep. Please go inside he's waiting for you. Thanks. May I? Come, Harleen. Hi. - Come in. How are you? Please be seated. Thanks. - Would you like to have something? No, thank you. Yes, dad has told me about you.. ...that you want to take factory training. Please feel at home. Do tell me if you need anything. Thank you. Thank you so much. Strange, you have come to your own office. Please don't embarrass me by saying thank you. Thank you. Again? Go and meet Mr. Sharma, | have explained him everything. Okay, thank.. sorry. Bye. - Bye. Good news. Good news. Good news. My very good friend lieutenant Vikramjeet Singh has.. ...sent me the photographs of three army officers.. ...select one from these and decide.. ...which boy is suitable for our Chindi. Mr. Army officer, we don't have.. ...a single great officer in our house.. ...and you are ready to get another one. Leave aside army officer, I'll not allow Chindi.. ...to marry even a NCC cadet. First of all I'll tear off your news paper. You begin your day watching the advertisements.. ...then you start checking the e-mails. You have sent the girl's picture.. ...to so many NRI boys till today. Listen to me, I'll get my daughter married.. ...only to an army officer. Okay, I have no objection at all. Marry her off to an army officer. Well-done, that's like an obedient son. But the boy must be from Canadian army. And now you are speaking like a disobedient son. You got your name cancelled from the army.. ...and now you blame the army. Respected father, I got my name cance||ed.. ...but you defamed yourself. There was a case going on against you for one whole year. | came out clean from that very case. That is why I bring so much cash into the house. Grandpa, was there a corruption case against you? Dear, don't listen to him. It was like this, a jealous army officer.. ...got me trapped into this case. Just to defame my name. Grandpa, didn't you run the cannons in the army? Cannons.. - He used to run the knife on the vegetables. He was a chef in the army. | was a chef in the beginning, but didn't I get a promotion afterwards? You didn't get the promotion for some bravery act.. ...it was due to chopping four onions in one minute.. ...in front of the Brigadier, so you got a promotion. At least I got a promotion, not like you.. I didn't run away like you from the army. Keeps on boasting all the time. Listen to me everybody, if the girl is not married to an army officer.. ...then I'll not perform the grand parents introduction ceremony. Father, you don't worry about that. We'll get Chindi married in such a house.. ...where the grandfather is already no more in this world. You have pampered him and spoilt him. Look at these three pictures, come select one quickly. Father, I have already selected one. | like this boy, looks like he's born and brought up in Canada. And then look at this one, he's wearing a stud in his ear. You both are fighting with each other.. ...first ask the girl's opinion. Not to worry, | won't complain even if.. ...you get me married to a librarian. Father, I have sent Chindi's pictures.. ...to hundred and twenty four boys. Whoever gives me the response.. .I'l get her married to that very boy. It's time to decide now. I'm taking all the three pictures upstairs.. _I'll sing 'eeny meeny mina mow'.. ...and wherever the limerick stops.. ...the girl's marriage will be fixed that boy. That's it. Father, there you are speaking like an army officer. He's simply impossible. He'll never change. Brother, if I choose a girl in the college, then? Good for you. And what if I get married to her? I'll also have kids after marriage. I'll pick up the kids in my arms, I'll play with them.. .I'll also pamper them. But what if my kids ask me while playing in your arms.. ...where is their uncle's wife, what will I answer them then? You can tell them that your uncle doesn't have an aunt.. ...So you have to bear your uncle alone. Okay? I'm unable to bear it now, brother. Unless you get married | won't be able to marry. | wanted to ask you when are you planning to get married. | haven't decided yet. Right now I feel like beating you. Don't want to do anything and won't let others do anything. Why are you making faces? I'm going through such a big problem, can't you be a bit serious? Do you want me to be on drip, just to show that I'm serious? Only then, you'll realise that I'm serious? I'm trying to think. You don't even let me think. Yes, I have an idea. Very interesting.. ...I have come up with a unique idea. Now ask what you wanted to ask. What shall I ask you, | have already told you.. ...my father wants to get me married to an NR|.. ...and my grandpa is searching an army officer for me. Now you tell me what is to be done. Let's elope. Shame on you. This isn't a unique, but a very antic idea.. ...from Romeo and Juliet's time. | meant to say that let's elope from our houses.. ...when your family members will be tired after searching us.. ...and when our three or four kids will give a knock on their door.. ...though not on us, maybe your family members.. ...will have pity on your kids. And what if they see us off on a train before that? Very good, we'll save our money. We'll go on our honeymoon on their expenses. I'm not talking about our honeymoon.. ...I'm talking about our murder. Have you heard about honour killing? Do you know those who marry after eloping from their houses.. ...what people do with them? You are scaring me how. Tell me, your mother is supporting whom.. ...your father or your grandfather? Me. Look, I have nobody to support me.. | have no support at all. | have no one at my side, right? Dumbo, what's wrong with your brain? If my mother is on my side then.. ...she's automatically on your side too. You come up with a good scheme.. ...I'm sure my mother will definitely support us. Really? If your mother supports us.. ...then I won't let our love story fail. Hello, grandma. - Hello. Hello, father. - Come, son, sit down. | want to discuss something with you. Tell me, father. What I'm going to ask you now, you can't prolong it any longer. My very good friend Mr. Sachhar.. ...has send me his daughter's photograph. Think and then give the answer.. ...it will be very difficult for me to say no to him. Father, Rajveer is also a bachelor.. ...why don't you talk about his proposal with Mr. Sachhar? You are intelligent, son, I have discussed about you with him.. ...not about Rajveer. Father, you know it very well.. ...my answer is still the same even today.. | know the reason for your denial, son. I'm your father, not your enemy. Ask me how difficult it is to live your life all alone. They way I have spent five years.. ...I'll spend the rest of my life in the same manner. Sukh. Don't get upset, I'll speak to him. It's of no use, mother. The sad part is where he was five tears back.. ...he's still over there till today. "My love, my eyes are filled with tears when I think of you." "My heart has fallen for you. You are pious, my love." "My heart has fallen for you. You are pious, my love." "I can't take my eyes off her." "0 God. " "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "I have lost my sleep and I'm in trouble."

"O God, I have lost my sleep.” "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "| feel like giving her all the happiness in this world." "I owe my whole life for her." "I'm not aware of what's happening with me." "But I'm glad about whatever is happening with me." "I'm not aware of what's happening with me." "But I'm glad about whatever is happening with me." "Her grace is there in the air." "0 God. " "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "I have lost my sleep and I'm in trouble." "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "O God, I have lost my sleep.” "O God, I have lost my sleep.” I'm really very sorry. It's my mistake. Let me drop you home. You can change your clothes there.. ...I'll drop you wherever you want to go afterwards. It's okay, I'll go. But how can I leave you in this condition? Please make her understand. Come on, Aman, how will you go to college in these clothes? Go home and change your dress. He'll drop you to college. And he deserves this punishment. Saw she is so intelligent? She is speaking so wisely. What? - Yes. I'm ready to face my punishment.. ...you can't go anywhere, but only to home in this condition.. Go. Go. Aman? What happened, why have you come back? What happened to your clothes? Aunt, it's not her mistake. She was standing at the bus stop.. ...and her clothes were spoiled by the muck due to my car. No problem, son, what happened is happened. You brought her home, that's more than enough for me. Please come inside, I'll get coffee for you. No, aunt, thanks for the tea. Let her change, then I'll drop her wherever she wants to go. Mother, Aman is saying no need to wait, she'll go on her own. Aman is right, son, where will you drop her. She'll change and go to her college. Okay, aunt, as you wish. Goodbye. Yes. Hello. Hello. Is this Sikho house? Yes, tell me. Can I speak to Amandeep? What do you want to tell her? Actually she forgot her book in my car in the morning. Why are you bothering me? She's in the hospital. She's given birth to a third daughter. Third daughter. How could she forget her book in your car? The whole family is mourning. Shall I give you the address if you want to come? Hello. Hello, is Aman at home? - Aman. Buddy, from the day I got married.. ...I have lost peace, happiness and solace from my life. Actually Aman forgot her book in my car today. Okay, how I have understood your game. You keep forgetting your book in others' car.. ...and you blame me that I went to watch.. ...'3 Idiots' movie with my secretary? I'm the biggest idiot, I'm unaware.. ...of what is happening in his own house. I'll commit suicide if you try to blame me. I'll also commit suicide if you stop me.. ...from watching movies with her. You know she is such a sweet lady. Hello. Hello, Sukhdeep here. Sukhdeep? Yes. I.. I met you in the morning. Yes, yes, son, tell me. Aunt, can I talk to Aman? Wait, I'll call her.

Okay, grandma, so you know that I'm in love.. ...the supreme court is sitting outside.. ...please go and take his permission too. So now you need your grandma? Don't worry, I'll talk to him today itself. Thank you, grandma. Vikram Singh, order for your son's wedding cards.. ...your son has selected a girl. - Really, mother? Ask him if you don't believe me. Sukh. - Yes, father. What, father? | had sent you to Chandigarh with the income-tax papers.. ...and you came back falling in love? Come, sit. Tell me about the girl's family. I don't know much in detail. Yes, I know only this much that.. ...her father is no more and the girl is doing MBBS. | have met only the girl and her mother. The family seems to be good. But they are not wealthy. Money is not important. Lots of wrong people have money with them. The girl should belong to a good family. She must be from a respectable family. Am I right, mother? What do you say, shall we go to Chandigarh? Let's go and see our son's choice. It's a very good idea. From my side, let's go now. Well-done, child. The girl doesn't have a father.. ...but you still educated your daughter so well. | would say that we are lucky enough to have found your daughter.. ...who is so talented and well-educated.. ...to become the daughter-in-law of our family. Thanks a lot, grandma. I'm highly obliged. By the way, tell me something about your background? | didn't get you. Tell me something about the girl's.. ...maternal parents' and grandparents' village? | represent girl's maternal parents' side and grandparents' side. My daughter and I live alone. Look, there are differences in families. But the absence of relatives in a wedding looks very bad. Okay, if you insist I will ask them.. ...but I don't feel anybody will come. Mr. Sekho was working as an SDO at which place? Fatehgadh Saab. Fatehgadh Saab? My friend Malkit Singh is working there from past many years. Malkit Singh Bhullar? Yes. He's was a very good friend of Aman's father. It's a very good thing then. Let it be, let's not discuss all this. Have some sweets on this joyous occasion. So Mr. Sandhu, how did you remember me after so many days? Lawyer, I wanted to get some information from you.. Was there anybody named Satnam Singh Sekho working.. ...in your electric city board? He was an SDO. Satnam Singh Sekho? SDO? Oh yes, I remember, there was one.. ...but he expired 20-25 years back. Yes, I know that. But his daughter is doing MBBS in Chandigarh.. ...she'll become a doctor after two years. My son Sukhdeep has got a proposal from their family. His daughter? But Mr. Sekho was unmarried. Yes, he got engaged. Few days before his wedding. Mr. Sekho died in an accident. Then how was her mother saying that.. ...the name of the girl's father is Satnam Singh Sekho? She has to say something, after all her daughter.. ...is going to get married into such a rich family. What is your opinion about this proposal? Leave me, Mr. Sandhu, there is no match between both the families. And now are you going to get your son married to a girl.. ...whose mother is unmarried? The girl's uncles and aunts don't keep any relation with them.. ...due to fear of disgrace. Do you want to get your son married into such a family? Vikram, is there no way.. no way through.. ...which we can go forward with this alliance? No, mother. That girl is daughter of an unwedded mother. | will never allow my son to marry such a girl. But son.. Grandma. Hello, father. Hello, grandma. Hello. God bless you. Please be seated, Sukh. | want to discuss something very important with you. Son, you went to Chandigarh and chose a girl for you from there.. ...we accepted everything without seeing or doing any enquiry. Yes, father. You said that they are not very rich. | told you that it doesn't matter to me if they are not wealthy. God has blessed us enough. But she should hail from a good family. Thanks a lot, father. Well, in such matters usually the girl's parents..' ...come to the boy's house.. ...I didn't bother about that too. We went to their house along with grandma. Yes, father. But what's the matter? Son, the matter is very serious. The girl's mother said that.. ...the girl's father's name is Satnam Singh Sekho.. ...but she was never married to Mr. Sekho. She's a daughter of an unwed mother. But father, it's not Aman's fault in this. Those kids who are raised in the orphanage.. ...even they are not at fault.. ...but they don't receive everybody's love. Father, I agree that Aman does not have a father.. ...but she has her mother. Try to understand the matter, son. Tomorrow when we'll go to the girl's house in your wedding procession.. ...and if there are no relatives at the time.. ...of the introduction ceremony.. ...you only tell me, won't our family's name be defamed? Tell me. This means you are rejecting Aman's proposal? I'm helpless my son. | can't do what you wish me to do. I'm sorry. Alright, father.. ...it maybe your decision to not bring Aman into this house.. ...but to leave this house for Aman can also be my decision. Sukh, my son.. | can very well understand what you are going through. And your father is also feeling sad about it, son. Try to understand him. Don't be so adamant. Am I acting adamant, grandma? It's he who is being so stubborn, he's making mountain of a molehill. Yes.. he's very stubborn. You both were very young when your mother left all of us. Everybody forced him a lot.. ...but that stubborn man did not remarry. He was.. he was adamant about one thing.. .That I'll not geta stepmother for my kids. He spent his entire life all alone just for the sake of you both. Son, it's not right to get angry.. ...for such a small reason in front of such a good hearted father. Small thing? My life is getting ruined and you feel that it's a small thing, grandma? The alliance of your choice will ruin your father's dignity.. ...is this a small matter for you? Son, he's helpless due to the customs of this society. If.. If you were in his place.. ...you would have also taken the same decision for your son.. ...which he's taking for you. "You both were very young when your mother left all of us.' 'Everybody forced him a lot.. ...but that stubborn man did not remarry." 'He was adamant about one thing.. ...that I'll not get a stepmother for my kids." 'He spent his entire life all alone just for the sake of you both."' We'll consider that we didn't deserve.. ...the love of our elders in our life. That's why no one came to meet me from my maternal side. That day father and grandma came home.. .| felt as though my life is going to be complete now. But no, whatever we don't deserve in our destiny.. ...that vacuum never gets filled. Whenever you get married.. ...don't forget to write my name on one card. "Beloved, I'll wait for you till the end." "You tell me before going how I shall live without you." "You only show me the path, how I will live without you." "My life has no meaning without you." Why hasn't he come as yet? | don't know why he hasn't come. Hello. Hello.. What are you doing? | told you to bring your mother. You brought your elder sister instead. No, she is.. Thanks for the compliments. | look like her sister, but I am her mother. Oh. - Saw, mother. | told you, he is a very nice boy. Take a look. Take a look. Today for the first time, | have worn a borrowed t-shirt. | will get caught today. Son. - Yes? Do you dye your hair? Hear that? I've never done anything wrong. How can I dye my hair? | am not that kind of.. Why, mother? Do you have a doubt? No. He looks a little aged. | knew it. This is the thing you won't like in me. Aunt, I am just like other kids. There is only a difference of a month or two. Difference? How so? Usually kids are born in 9 months. | was born after 11 months. That's it. But thankfully my Chindi was born in the 9th month. Mother, don't consider it to be your miracle. Kids are normally born in the 9th month. | was two months late. Dear, did you tell him everything? Yes, mother. Don't worry. He knows everything. - Everything. | know everything. - You don't worry, sister. | end up calling you sister, after all. Actually, I will take care of her father and her grandfather. Major Natta Singh. At ease. By the way, sir, | didn't recognise you. We have met twice in this canteen. Where are you posted, sir? | mean, where are you posted these days, sir? Posting? Cheerapuniji. As far as I know, there is no army unit in Cheerapunji, sir. You are right. As far as you know, there is no army unit there. Actually, it is a little ahead of that. Correct, sir. Commander used to say the same. "Natta Singh, think before you speak." Right. But as far as I know, it rains like cats and dogs in Cheerapuniji. No army base can station over there. You are again right. Whenever a base was made, it used to flow away with the rains. Have you covered the base with a plastic cover now? No. Now we have made it waterproof. Great, sir. | have booked a family quarter over there. Your family is settled over there, sir. No. | don't have a family. | have taken 15 days' leave, Lieutenant. To get married. | will get married within 10 days and.. ...have a honeymoon of five days.. ...and go back with my family. To Cheerapuniji. | have a girl in mind, sir. No. I don't want the girl to be in mind. I want her in reality. She is real, sir. Would you like to see her? No. No. By the way, I want the girl to have an army background. The girl is.. The girl is my granddaughter, sir. Would you like to meet her, sir? Well, if you insist, then I shall meet her. Thank you sir. Come along then. Follow my cycle. You come in your car. Halt. Lieutenant, I cannot go right now. It's time to gamble. You gamble? - No. Not that gambling. Actually, snooker. You know a big ball on the table. They are pushed with a wooden stick. If it falls in the pocket you win. Anyway, glad to see you. Let's meet on Sunday at your place. | will see your granddaughter at 11:00am. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Mr. Mittal, it's me. Tell me. How did your management committee like our business proposals? Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Harleen. Your proposals were accepted. - Wow! With this deal our company will make a profit of 5 millions. Really? - Well-done. Thanks. Thank you so much. Mr. Randhawa, have you thought about Harleen's marriage? Sandhu, the girl wants to complete her education. We will see later. What's the use of thinking about it now? If we start thinking now, only then will we get a nice boy. Okay, then. You find a boy for my daughter.. ...and I will find girls for your boys. Let's see who succeeds first. Let's see. Hello. May I speak to Mr.. It is a very strange name. Harnam Singh, please? Speaking. Well, I am an NRI boy. | have come from Canada. Very good. A nice NRI boy is on the line. Yes, tell me. Actually, you had sent me your daughter's photo through email. Son, I have sent my daughter's photo to thousands of boys through email. You too must have got one. Well, I like your daughter's photo. Send your daughter to my hotel. | am staying in Hotel Regency. What do you mean? No. You misunderstood me. | mean you come to the hotel with your daughter. We will see each other. It is possible that | might like your daughter. Son, does the girl really need to come there? Is it possible that the two of us meet first? Actually, your daughter looks short in the photo. | think the boy is very intelligent. From the photo he guessed her height. Son, you just say yes, we will increase the girl's height. Look, I am an NRI. We are very choosey. First we should like the girl. If we like the girl, then what do we have to do with the family? We don't care if their door is termite infected. Okay. Okay. Hello? It got disconnected. Congratulations, Prem Kaur. This is a very auspicious day. It's not day. It's night. Okay. This is a very auspicious night. A NRI boy is coming for our Chindi. Chindi, quickly get ready and go to Hotel Regency with your father. How did you know that the boy is coming to hotel Regency? You had said that let's meet in the Hotel Regency. | said so, dear. Yes, I must have. Then dear, get ready urgently to go to hotel Regency. Hurry up, dear. Otherwise someone else might claim the boy. Let's go there, dear. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hi. Hello, kids. How are you? The NRI didn't come as yet. A letterbox is coming this way. Looks like he is the one. - Stop your nonsense. NRIs have sharp ears. Welcome to this place. From me. This restaurant.. I am.. From the two of you, who is Harman Singh? Obviously.. Singh is usually used with a guy's name. Who told you? You backward Indian people. Who told you that "Singh" can be used only in a boy's name? Does Upasana Singh tie a turban? Has Gracy Singh grown a moustache? Has Neetu Singh kept a French cut? Actually, son, considering the knowledge you have about India.. ...it doesn't feel like you have come from Canada. Looks like you have come from Pakabhag. Internet. | do a lot of surfing. If you search the internet you will get Pakabhag there. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am Harnam Singh, son. Harnam Singh. You didn't tell me. - You didn't give me a chance, son. Mr. Harnam Singh, it's a pleasure to meet you. Why so, son? Good question. Actually I have met a lot of Harham Singh in my life. But it isn't a pleasure to meet every Harnam Singh. Look, it's a pleasure to meet some Harnam Singh. While itisn't a pleasure some Harnam Singh. But you are that Harnam Singh meeting whom is a pleasure. Thank you. This girl wants to go to Canada? What is her name? Sukhshinder Kaur. - Sukhshinder Kaur is a very big name. Typical Indian long name. Such names are not accepted well abroad. Let me tell you. Over there her name will be Chindi. Chindi. What a co-accident, son! Coincidence. Actually, we call her Chindi at home. What does she do? - She is a libra-rian. Libra-rian? - Yes. Yes. Oh, I am Cancerian. No. Son, not that one. - Okay. | mean, books, closed, fold, issue, take back. Now I got it. She's a librarian. Yes. Yes. Yes. He is getting frank. Son, what do you do in Canada? | go to clubs, pubs and go for long drives as well. No. | am not asking what you do in your free time, son. | am asking what your profession is in Canada. Actually, there is a small village over there. Steven Stone Village. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Four-five of my planes run there. Big planes in a small village? | think I have bluffed a lot. | mean the planes are not very big. They are small planes. Like the ones that run in your villages. Small ones. They have a pointed nose. Like a pole. He has become more frank. | have three-four berry farms over there. - Okay. | have four-five radio stations. | have other options as well. When I am free, and if I fall short of dollars for grocery.. ...then I drive taxi as well, sometimes. He has become very frank. Son, I think the girl who will marry you will have a lot of fun. Hear that. Even Abhishek Bachchan won't have as much fun as my wife will. Where do you stay in Canada? | stay in Vancouver. | have a big mansion over there. | have 17-18 cars. | have a car to take from car to car. My wife will have a lot of fun. She will take a car from Vancouver.. ...and go to Toronto, get the grocery and come back to Vancouver. Your daughter will enjoy it. My daughter? - Yes. Son, so should | consider this marriage fixed? Fixed? Super fixed. How else should I fix it? Look, I like your daughter. You make passports for your entire family. You are talking about passports. Three months ago, I got the passports of all the family members, son. Still, get them renewed. You never know. Many a times passports expire because of non-usage. Passports expire because of non-usage? He has become fully frank. Very good. Very good. Very good. What is wrong with you? Distribute sweets, Prem Kaur. We got our NRI before his army officer. Chindi will go to Canada. Canada. How can she go to Canada? And not you, I have got a gem of a person. In the military canteen. - You get rum over there, not gems. | met the captain there. He is coming to our house on Sunday at 11:00am. Captain still has to meet her. We have already made the girl meet the NRI boy. Next Sunday at 12:00pm the boy is coming to see you. Why? Am I a lion in a zoo whom he is coming to see? You didn't get it, father. He is coming to meet the family. What is that boy's name? - NRI. Stupid, can NRI ever be anyone's name? | forgot to ask his name. - I wonder which fraudster he met. Okay. I have met you. You can meet him next Sunday. Fine. This is the last chance for the two of you. If anything goes wrong | will get my daughter married.. ...to the person I want. Look, now Chindi will go to Canada. No. I will settle Chindi in the waterproof base in Cheerapunji. Stop it. Now both of you calm down. This will be decided on Sunday. You are a wonderful girl, Harleen. | have never seen a girl like you. Oh really! By the way, how many girls do you know? Well, I know at least 100 girls. Okay. Not 100, but I know 10-12 of them very well. 10-12. Shall I tell the truth? | know only one girl. Harleen. Rajveer. Rajveer. Rajveer. - What happened? Rajveer. Their parents agreed to their alliance. That's great. - They are not giving us a party. Not a problem. I will give everyone a party today. O Yes! kay? - Okay. "We are bad in Botany." "A small peg." "We are bad in Botany. A small peg." "Along with kebabs. And beautiful company." "I have a request. My only request." "Let us be free. No one should ever stop us, brother." "The rest of our work.." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "We love to climb up on the open rooftops cars." "We love to climb up on the open rooftops cars." "We make sure to go to Geary route everyday." "The style of our jeans." "We have two mobiles." "The style of our jeans. We have two mobiles." "There is always a smile on our face." "No one should ever stop us, brother." "The rest of our work.." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "Brother, let people say anything about us." "Brother, let people say anything about us." "We have no worries. We are happy with what we do." "When the day comes to an end." "We feel restless." "When the day comes to an end. We feel restless." "Now we drink openly. Earlier we used to drink stealthily, brother." "Stealthily, brother." "The rest of our work.." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." "The rest of our work is okay, brother." Hello. Hello. Who is speaking? Lieutenant Natta Singh speaking. Not Lieutenant Natta Singh. Say Lieutenant Natta Singh Alhuwala. Captain? I didn't get you. If you didn't, then you should die out of shame. What are you saying? Why? Is there a problem dying? I think you are in a mood to joke today, Captain. Joke? That too with a corrupt person like you? No way. Never. Corrupt? Lieutenant, when you were a 'Langri' (kitchen help) in the army.. ...weren't you caught in 10 - sacks-potatoes-gone-missing case? No. That issue got cleared later. The thing is our brigadier has arranged.. ...for a personal religious meal. | had sent the potatoes there. Potatoes were used for a good deed. What good deed? The case went on for a year. You had to wander for 1% years for pension. | would rather stay single.. ...than becoming son-in-law of such a corrupt person. Captain, forget the rest, tell me.. ...who told you about the potatoes? Thanks to someone called Harnam Singh.. ...who told me everything on time and.. ...saved me from being a son-in-law of such a corrupt person. What? Sir? Sir. Hello. Sir. Harnam. Harnam. Harnam. Where are you? | have gone to Pathankot. Can't you see me standing here? Who told Captain Tungahari that I was.. ...involved in the potato case? Father, one can find out truth from anywhere. And then, the news about this case.. ...was even printed in Akali newspaper. Let it be. I know everything. To make the girl marry an NRI boy you made my officer run away? Tell that NRI that if he enters this house, then I will blow him apart. The gun is loaded and so am I. Chindi darling, where are you? NRI, son, I welcome home. Are you alright, father? Okay. Okay. Prem Kaur. Is he yours? Or does he belong to someone else? Wait, I will tell you. Answer waste. Do they address sons-in-law like this in your place? Wait, I will tell you. | will tell you. | will tell you. Father, what have you done? You made my NRI run away. You made my officer run away. | made your NRI run away. We are quits now. You have done what you could. Now should I show you what boy | have selected for our Chindi? This is my NRI boy. This is my captain from Cheerapunji. Father, talk sense at least sometimes. How can one person be at two places? Are you talking about Harinder Singh Tungahari Cheerapunji? And are you talking about Lali Canadian with small planes? Yes. - Yes. You got mislead. Actually, we are triplets. Triplets? Son, I have heard of fritters. What is 'triplets'? When two kids are born together they are twins. We three were born together, hence we are triplets. Thank God four of you weren't born together.. ...otherwise you would have become broad. Don't act very smart, son. Tell me, did you know our daughter's alliance.. ...is being fixed into your family? Our entire family knew that your daughter's.. ...alliance was being fixed into our family. But I think your family didn't know.. ...that your daughter's alliance was being fixed into my family. Saw? This proves that the boy is from a good family. Mother. Listen. | don't care which family you belong to. You bring my officer back. You can keep his officer with you. You bring my NRI back. They were fighting for you daughter at the Push Street. The officer shot the NRI and ran away. And you know that such officers get arrested. Yes. He too will get arrested. | too was arrested. The NRI was very naive and innocent. He lost his life for her. Thank God nothing happened to our Chindi. God settled everything on its own. Come on, son. Touch their feet. Give your blessings to the boy. Hey, boys! You are looking sad as if you have been thrown out of the college.. ...and now your family is not accepting you. You think this is a joke? Stop it, man. Rajveer is in a big mess. Why? What happened? What will happen? He didn't clear the third semester. He has scored fewer marks in the fourth semester. And the result is bad. Mr. Sandhu, you look sad.. ...as if you want an admission in a MBA college. Let this MBA go to hell, Kang. The problem is my MBA. Master of Biological Aashiqui (Love). That will stop. Now father will take me out of the college.. ...and throw me into the factory machines. No, dear. Don't leave the college. We won't like this place without you. Scoundrel, why don't you say that you will have to.. ...pay all the canteen bills? And you won't get a car to drive Chindi around. Hear that. We take so much advantage of you. We love you. Then save your friend. Think of a scheme, Mr. Kang. Scheme. Here you go. It's done. Consider the work done. Why are you doing this? Now see what happens. Mr. Sandhu. Mr. Sandhu. Mr. Sandhu, congratulations! Congratulations. Order for sweets and distribute them in the entire colony. Rajveer has made our University proud. Forgive me, but I didn't recognise you. Forgiven. | mean how you will recognise me. We are meeting for the first time. | am the dean for MBA in Rajveer's University. And I have brought good news for you. Your son has done a great deed. Now tell me where you are giving the party. | will surely give a party.. ...but you tell me how this miracle took place. Look at this. | have brought this. | forgot the mark sheet at home. He has scored full marks in all papers. | mean he has passed in first division. We didn't keep his photo on purpose. We thought some evil eye will cast on him. Hello. Hello. Hello. Father, he is the dean for MBA in the university. Mr. Tandon. He wants to meet you regarding Rajveer's result. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where are you going, sir? Let us listen to what he has to say. | am sorry, Mr. Sandhu. | am feeling embarrassed to say that your son Rajveer.. ...has failed the fourth semester. And now, he is out of the University. Strange. This dean is saying that he stood first. And you are saying that he is out of the University. Who is telling the truth and who is lying? Sir, you are the dean of which place? | used to be a dean before you. Now I am the vice principal of a private school. | was here with some Bunty's result. 6th grade student. | think I have brought the wrong paper. | think I have come to the wrong place. The houses in this colony are so similar. | didn't come to know. You have come to the right place. Now you tell us who you are. | think that is Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang, tell me, what I should do with you for what you have done? Forget the deed, look at the performance. That's it. What should you do? Forgive people like me and let them go. So, Mr. Tandon, what should we do? Mr. Tandon, he is my brother's friend. Forgive him. | will forgive the dean, if you say so. Bye. There is a limit to shamelessness. Rajveer, it's very late. Don't you want to go home? What should I do, Harleen? | don't feel like it. Now you realise it? You didn't listen to me when I kept telling you. Yes, Harleen. | am realising my mistake today. People tell the truth. One shouldn't waste time. Otherwise time wastes you. Ragging is illegal. But what you are doing with her is legal? Mind your language, Richie. | am already in a very bad mood. It is better if you leave this place. We are here to cheer you up. You got me out of college for seven days. And I want to send you to the hospital for seven days. Richie, I told you I am not in the mood to fight today. Don't mess with me. Excuse me, sir. Surinder, take her home. Take them to the police station. | had never in my life visited a police station.. ...and you went to the police station fighting for a girl? During the day we got your result.. ...and this is what you did in the evening? | don't know whether | should send you to factory or not. Young girls work there as well. Please, father. Father, I agree that he has made a mistake. But please, don't accuse him of that. Till when will you pamper him? Vikram Singh, why are you after his life? What crime has he committed? And consider his age before talking to him. Nowadays parents think twice before telling anything.. ...to their young daughters. And you are telling him all this without giving it a thought. Okay, mother. I won't. You tell me what I should do. Quietly get him married and settle him down. Once he gets the responsibility he will learn everything. Tell me, who is the girl? | will go and talk to her parents. What will you talk about? And who will you talk to, mother? First cross the wall standing in front of him. If we marry the younger one before we marry the older one.. ...then what will people think? Before the world, your son will. Is he a kid that he won't think about you, me or his brother? He won't. He won't. | have tried explaining to him. | think no wedding will ever take place in this house. "My friend, my love." "If I could.." "I would not ruin myself because of you." "If there was someone else like you.." "I would not ruin myself because of you." "If there was someone else like you.." "If there was someone else like you.." Sukh, my son. You know what your father wants? He wants.. ...that if his old mother gets to see her grandsons.. ...then perhaps she will die in peace. Grandma, please don't do such a thing, for God's sake. | wouldn't have, if your mother was alive. But what do I do? My last years are slipping away from my hand, son. Grandma.. Yes, son. We all want to see you married. Just once be an older brother and think about your younger brother. Be a nice boy and think about your grandma. For how long will I be here? Grandma.. | am telling the truth, son. If you agree to get married.. ...then I would refuse to leave this world. Your life is more precious than mine, grandma. | pray you live for 100 years. Son, we have lost our patience. We all want to see you married. Fulfil our wish, son. Give us happiness, son. Grandma, if everything depends on me.. ...then get me married wherever you want. Really? - Yes. Never talk about leaving us, grandma. My son. My child. You don't know what you have given us, son. I will go and give this good news to your father. My child. Kram Singh. Why do you look so sad? Go to the Sikh temple and give an offering. Sukh has agreed to get married. What are you saying? Grandma.. Grandma, brother agreed to get married? Yes, son. Yes. Kram, call Randhawa and talk to him. Hurry up! Why uncle Randhawa, grandma? Son, Sukh agreed to marry Randhawa's daughter Harleen. Vikram Singh. Get up. Quickly call him up. "My dear. My dear. My dear." "If you wish to enjoy love." "My dear. My dear. My dear." "If you wish to enjoy love." "My dear. My dear. My dear." "If you wish to enjoy love." "Always treat her like a princess." "My dear. My dear. My dear." "If you wish to enjoy love." "My dear. My dear. My dear." "If you wish to enjoy love." "| agree to whatever you say." "| agree to whatever you say." "I will do as you say." "Whatever you say." "I have been blessed with good fortune." "God alone decides our destiny." "Only God can unite the soul mates." "Only God can unite the soul mates." "Your eyes are expressing your desires." "The heart knows what the heart wants." "Your eyes are expressing your desires." "The heart knows what the heart wants." "..Who cares about the world."

Why did you get up all of a sudden? Tell me if there is a problem. No, brother. No problem. It is not possible that | don't come to know.. ...when something is disturbing you. Are you disturbed because of your fight with the college boys? No, brother. Today all of a sudden, | am missing mother a lot. | was thinking that if she had been here.. ...then she would have been so happy for your marriage. This is called blood relation, brother. What I should have felt, you are feeling it. You are right, brother. | can also feel that there is nothing greater than time. It makes us laugh and cry. It unites us and separates us. Look, Randhawa, I fulfilled the promise I made to you. Promise? - Didn't I tell you, that | will find a boy for your girl? Yes, you did. Did you find any? I did. I did. Now tell me, what will you give the middleman? A ring or a bracelet? | will give you whatever you want. First tell me who the boy is. The boy? The boy is our Sukhdeep. Sukhdeep? Look, Sandhu, I hope you are not joking. Strange. Is this something to joke about? You are great, Sandhu. By God, I cannot believe it. You want to make my daughter your daughter-in-law. | don't want to, | have already done so. Now you ask your daughter whether.. ...she agrees to this alliance or not. Sandhu, do you think my daughter will refuse me? It's not like it used to be, Randhawa. When mothers-in-law used to see their daughters-in-law.. ...for the first time after the marriage. It is better to ask the kids nowadays. If you say, I will ask her. Harleen is here. Hold on for a minute. Harleen. - Yes, father. Uncle Sandhu is on the line. He has selected you for his son. You tell me. Asked her. She felt shy and went away. Then congratulations to all of you. | will send Sukhdeep and his grandma.. ...to your place for shopping. You should quickly start preparing for the engagement. Good morning, Mr. Kang. Very good morning, Harleen. Hello. How are you? Very good. Have you seen Rajveer? | hadn't seen or heard him. I tried calling him a number of times. ...but he isn't answering his phone. Okay. Then I will go and check. Yes, do that. He might be busy with some other girlfriend. Hi, Rajveer. Hi, Harleen. Juice? Thank you. Enough. Rajveer, I am very happy today. Really? I too am very happy today. Then first you tell me why you are so happy. No, you tell me. No, you. When a person gets what he desires, he feels happy, right? | hadn't thought that your father will fix our marriage. It sounds like a dream. No, Harleen. He didn't fix your marriage with me. He fixed your marriage with my brother Sukhdeep, Sukhdeep? - Yes. No. This is not possible. How is it not possible? My family have always considered you for Sukh. But I have always thought about you. | always considered you my own. You are having a misunderstanding, Harleen. | always considered you just a friend. Nothing more than that. You went to my brother's factory for training. They saw you and selected you. And the marriage was fixed. And what about the relationship that you formed with me? What was that? What relationship are you talking about, Harleen? You met me 6 months back. Do you know how many girls there have been.. ...before these 6 months? | never thought about marrying anyone. Look, Harleen, you belong to my brother. He will keep you very happy. Swear by me you won't refuse this alliance. If we don't share a relationship.. ...then why are you making me swear? How am I related to you? Rajveer, what do you think? Am I a baby? That I cannot understand anything? Should I tell you, Rajveer? You are sacrificing my love to make your brother settle down. You are such a cheat. You are such a liar. | hate you. | hate you, Rajveer. I hate you. You love her a lot? No. I don't love Harleen. | didn't take Harleen's name. You shouldn't do that, my friend. You don't know love hurts. Time slowly heals all wounds, my friend. After five years with great difficulty.. ...brother Sukh agreed to marry someone. And now I should come in the middle? The happiness I saw on grandma and father's face today.. ...I don't even mind dying for it. Hi, Sukhdeep. - Hi. Hello, grandma. - Grandma. Your phone's battery down? Your phone was switched off. Sukhdeep and his grandma have been waiting for you. They were waiting for me? Dear, they want to take you along for shopping. Father, I want to talk to you about something very important. We will talk later, dear. Now quickly get ready and go with them. Have a look. How is this one, Harleen? It's nice, grandma. What is it, Harleen? What are you thinking about? No. Nothing. We should make this one final then, Harleen? Hey, Harleen. Hey, Harleen, how are you? We have completed our shopping for our wedding. Now when are you two getting married? He is Rajveer's elder brother. Sukhdeep. Hi. - Nice meeting you. We will make a move. Okay. Bye. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Harleen. Dear, try out the ring. Sukh, help her. Okay. Bye. Hear that. Even Mr. Randhawa doesn't know anything. Father, the way Harleen left me and grandma and ran from there.. ...I don't think there isn't a reason behind it. Mr. Randhawa said that the girl said yes. Then what can be the reason behind it? Rajveer. I'm sorry, father. Father, you don't tell him anything. | will talk to him. I'm totally drunk. Now what should I do? I am so happy for my brother's marriage. | feel like bathing the city with liquor. Rajveer. Don't you feel ashamed to talk about such things in front of me? Father, calm down. | will talk to him. Brother. - Rajveer. My brother. - Let's go. "A beautiful girl.." - Father will.. Careful. Now my brother's fortune will shine. Come on. Be careful. Be careful. Rajveer, what is wrong with you? You never got so drunk and came home. Tell me. I am your elder brother. Really, brother. Nothing's wrong. You agreed to get married and gave a new life to all of us. Harleen studies in my college. She is a very nice girl. Only fortunate ones get girls like her. You are a damn lucky person, brother. Dear, keeping quiet won't help. You will have to share your feelings. Why are you upset? We should know the reason. Uncle, Harleen won't tell you anything. | will tell you. Sukh, you? Yes, uncle. The thing is Rajveer and Harleen not just study in the same college.. ...they like each other as well. But when both the families decided to get us married.. ...my brother kept quiet for the sake of my happiness. And for the honour of your family Harleen didn't express her feelings. What are you saying, Sukhdeep? Look at her. The proof is in front of you. She has started crying. But still she didn't express her feelings. Harleen, you should have shared your feelings with your mother. You could have told your father. You shouldn't keep quiet like this. Uncle, aunt. We will get them married. Harleen, quickly get ready and come home with me. And go for shopping with Rajveer and grandma. At least thank me. Look here, father. | have caught one thief. You bring forth the other one. Thief? Father, you are preparing for my wedding unnecessarily. Harleen and Rajveer love each other. Harleen and Rajveer? Yes. Look, I am older than Rajveer. Now Harleen and Rajveer will first find a girl for me. Father, why did you let him go? | didn't come to know when he left. Hello. Yes. What? Excuse me, madam. Can we see patient Rajveer? We are his family. Sir, he is in the emergency room. You can go this way. Doctor. Is a patient named Rajveer in there? He is unconscious. You cannot meet him. Rajveer. Rajveer. What happened, son? Are you alright? | don't know what | am being punished for. You should have informed before leaving. | am sorry, father. Father can forgive, but I won't. Without any fault of mine you were about to give me a punishment.. ...that I wouldn't forget even after death. No, brother. Why no? You were giving your happiness to me.. ...and trying to settle me down. How could you forget that my happiness lies in yours? My life lies in yours. You are act elder with your elder brother? Couldn't you tell me that Harleen and you love each other? Listen, we have brought your Harleen with us. Look over there. Thank you very much, God. You have been generous to our child. Along with God also thank the doctor.. ...who brought him to the hospital at the right time.. ...and started treating him. Where can we meet the doctor? "My friend, my love." "You left my heart." "Then you met me again." "And I lost my soul." "Then you met me again." "And I lost my soul." "And I lost my soul." Dear, we were here to thank the doctor.. ...who saved Sukh's younger brother. Aunt, you don't need to thank. It's every doctor's duty to save a patient's life. You consider that we are there to give regards to that duty. Aunt, look, the way of God. The manner in which He made us meet again. Today all of a sudden you came to meet us. We are going to Canada after two days. Your daughter's in-laws are in Canada? No, aunt. Aman got Canada's permanent residency. She still didn't get married. Even our Sukh didn't get married. Dear, what couldn't happen five years ago.. ...can it not happen now as well? Why not, aunt? It surely can. If you still think about my daughter.. ...then I will happily get my daughter married into your family. No, mother. That is not possible. | was a daughter of an unwed mother five years ago. And I am her daughter now as well. Are you done, mother? Shall we go? Bye. "My friend, my love." "I am ruined, my beloved." "First God got angry with him." "Now you are angry with me." "First God got angry with him." "Now you are angry with me." "Now you are angry with me." Aman, we met and then parted ways at God's behest. Today he is making us meet again. Grandma has opened all the doors of our house for you. All of them. Why don't you reason it with Aman? Son, if the main gate is locked.. ...then open doors are of no use. Your father acceptance still remains. Perhaps my daughter is waiting for that. If he accepts, then will the wait be over? All the norms of the society hold no value.. ...in front of your and Sukh's love. But it is true that five years ago I saw the society and not you. Today I am looking at you and not the society. | hope you will surely value my new point of view. We will, father. We surely will. You gave in for the sake of our happiness. Mother, now there is no reason for Aman to leave. Dear.. No, mother. It's too late now. Why is it late? You decided to separate five years ago, not me. Ask father and grandma how I lived.. ...for these five years with your memories. In spite of all this I sometimes took care of father's happiness.. ...and sometimes gave in to grandma's decision. Today, I ask you for our happiness. Aman, before leaving at least tell me.. ...for what crime you are punishing me? Announcement. It's time for your flight. The decision is now in your hands. Grandma! What happened? Grandma. Aman, I beg of you. Please don't go. Because if you go, then my Sukh's lifetime's happiness.. ...will go with you, dear. | won't be able to endure it. Don't go, dear. Don't go. Why is there darkness in front of my eyes? What's happening to me? No, grandma. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to you. Don't forget that your daughter-in-law is a doctor. What did you say? Daughter-in-law? My daughter-in-law? My daughter-in-law. My child. Sir, now everything is fine. I, too, wanted my daughter to miss the flight.. ...which was separating her from you. Congratulations for this auspicious occasion, sister. Congratulations to you too, brother. You called me brother. Henceforth never think that you are alone. Never say that you have no one in this world. We are with you. Never. - That's better. "My friend. My beloved." "Keeping a hand on the heart we cried." "We were just distant from each other."
