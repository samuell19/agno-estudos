Done. Good as new. Bostik! Tube of that, roll of gaffer, decent screwdriver, you can cope with most things in life, Chris. Look, I'll see you later, buster? This one's hanging off 'an all. Colin, you said you'd stuck it! I did. Look, I'm late. I've gotta be at work in 15 minutes. I've gotta walk down there yet. Well, maybe if you didn't stop out till all hours of the morning, you'd be able to get up a bit earlier. All right. I've got a stomach-ache. No, you haven't. Go and clean your teeth. You think I'm daft. What are you talking about now? Where were you? You know where I was. At the Welfare with the lads. Out till four? Told you. Go on, Aidy'll be waiting for you. Why are you limping? I'm not. My shoe's broke. Me dad's fixed it, though. Jayne, I'm back, duck. Sorry I'm a bit late. My daddy works at Raleigh, which was in a film at the Futurist, which was where I saw Ring of Bright Water. I didn't see the film with Raleigh in it, even though it was made all round Nottingham, cos my mum said it was rude. Mum says lots of things are rude. Dad says she's his Player's Angel. What are you on about? I won a prize, Mum, in English. I tell you what, Betty, she's got a real talent for telling stories. Telling stories? She wants shorthand and typing. She's ten years old. I'm saying, in the future, for secretarial college. I don't want her stuck in a factory, like me. Why don't you go and watch telly? You've earned it. The Flashing Blades are on tonight. Yeah, the sword fighting. And Lady Isabel. She's me favourite. She's really beautiful. And she can ride a horse. She's taking us ice skating. She's doing what? Miss Fitzhugh, she said all the essays were good, so we're going to the ice rink tomorrow afternoon. Jayne... will it cost anything, this trip? Did Miss Fitzhugh mention anything about that? You know them PG Tips monkeys? They're all dead and they stuff them and move them around and they stuff them so they look alive. Yeah, I did. All right. See you, then. It's not how you know, obviously. But we need to be practical. What you doing? It's tea-time. I'm going to feed him. We don't want him in the house. It's his tea-time. Chris, come inside.

Of course you bloody agree! You've been having it off with my husband. He ought to kick you twice round the garden and once up the stairs. Mavis! Now, come on... Come on, nothing! I am upset.

Now, all you've got to do is let go of the rail. You'll be fine. You bounce at your age. On a count of three. One, two... There's always one. Hey, you should have a word with Miss Perry. Trainer. Yeah, the younger the better, as far as she's concerned. She's seen her anyway. You've lost her now. It's like that Child Catcher in that respect. Still, on the upside, she has trained half a dozen champions. She's class, Miss Perry. I hope you're happy now. I hope you're really happy! Christ. Sorry, Mavis. All right, come on. I don't think we should speak to him. He might not be ready. Colin, please. I'm not going to know what to say. All right, you do the talking, then. Chris... This is Betty. She's... She's like your new mum. Say hello. Say hello. Hello. Hello, Christopher. It's nice to meet you properly. I've brought you a present. I used to go when I was younger. And I asked your dad. He said you had bags of energy, and I thought you might like them. He will like them, don't worry. Cos I know how bloody dear they were. And... jump! That's it, dearie. On the cymbal crash. Here comes another one. And... jump! All right. We'll leave it there, Jayne. Public session. You're doing very well. People don't normally do tricks till they've been coming for weeks. We'll make a skater of you yet. Thank you, Miss Perry. Thank you, dearie.

Rrrr, ariba! I do love you, Miss Perry. Aw...! Jayne... You require a man. What? I'm not foolish, dearie. And I'm not oblivious to your needs. For a man? To emote! I've spoken to Norman about it. He has a Latin heart. He understands the flamboyant nature. Your desire to give vent, Jayne, to your passion and... your soul. You've wanted to do that ever since we started, but I'm rather too regimented, I think. So Norman and I believe that a partner might be the answer. More than a record change. He might become your conduit. Wow... Do you have anybody in mind? As a matter of fact, I do. ♪ All I need is the air that I breathe... ♪ Hi, I'm Andrew. ♪ All I need is the air that I breathe... ♪ How old? 22. 22? Almost. And you could tell, Mum, he's got that much experience. I'll bet he has... George! Are you saying Miss Perry suggested this? She thinks there's competitions we could win. Does she? Well, I better get down the bookies, then. What's his name? Is he from round here? I don't know. I mean, it's Andrew. Actually, he might have said Mapperley. Mapperley? I don't want you getting any airs and graces. What are you on about? Plains or Top? I don't know. And that isn't important. It's the partnership. He's going to liberate me. Christ. George...! Creatively. He says we're going to dance to David Bowie. Is that the one in the make-up? No, Jayne, I'm sorry, I'm not paying good money every week so you... But it's what I need, Mum. Can't you see that? Like, Miss Perry, she has me jumping to cymbal crashes and spinning round whenever I hear a gong. And there's no feeling to it. And I don't want that. I want to... I want to express myself. Why? What have you got to express? Hi. Urgh... Hang on. Bloody hell, Chris. Hey, actually, she's not bad, is she? She looks a bit like her off Pan's People. The red-haired one. Erm... Does all the solos. She's easily the best dancer. Ski jump tits. Dee Dee. Yeah! Yeah, she looks like her. Hey, come on. So, do you come here often, then? A cod and two smalls. What are you having? Er... Batter bits, pickled onion. What, you're not having chips? So, this isn't Russia. It's Calverton. You can have what you like. I might just have the pickled onion. All right, I'll get them. No, you won't! No, Chris, look, you can do it next time, all right? When you're... you know. Hey, you can even have a saveloy if you fancy. Wait, I'll not be a minute. What? Me mum's back. Wait... Chris! Hey up, Chris. Haven't you been in once? Chris! You're lucky you didn't break them both. Yeah, that's the way I'm looking at it. I didn't mean it reassuringly. I think you should find a partner. What? Well, consider competing. I think it might... Calm you down. Be good if you had a focus. And skating with someone, that'd be even better. Cos it'd mean you'd have another person to share all your feelings with. About being on the ice. You need to find a girl, Chris, I'm certain. He's like Hitler. He's like Hitler in ice skates. I told him last week. He maintains I weren't getting my leg up high enough when we was coming out the chasse. And it was basically a goose-step. So I said, "There's a reason, Christopher Dean, So I said, "that you can do this and I can't." But it never clicked. I don't think he's the sharpest tool in the box, you know. He's from Calvo, though, isn't he? Miners. I mean, they're born miners. Hey, that's another thing. How can he, coming from there, tell me I've got no artistry and I don't interpret the music? How are you getting on anyway with Andrew? He's gorgeous, isn't he? Do you think he looks like David Cassidy? I do. Has he, er... tried it on yet? I bet he has! No. We need to sort that out, then. Whatever. Just get it out of the way, or it handicaps the partnership. Everyone knows that. Do they? Everyone knows that. I mean... Right, erm... I just... He hasn't, you know... It's not been on the agenda. You're probably not giving out the right signals. Never mind. Jayne, you're on. Andrew's waiting. Thanks, Miss Perry. Leanne... Do you and... I mean, does he say stuff like that a lot? Chris. About being artistic and responding to music? Like, is he ever so creative? No. He's a pain, I'm saying. I'd much sooner have yours. Yeah, he... He can be very creative, too. Turn, two, three, four. And kick and two, three, four. And kick and stretch. And arch and a big smile. Feel my kneecap. Singles, keep the beat. Ba-dooby doo bum-bum. And turn and spin. Dum, dum, and... ♪ ..anyone can see ♪ Nothing really matters ♪ Nothing really matters ♪ To me ♪ Any way the wind blows. ♪ Lovely, well done. What was that? Hey? At the end. Were you not listening to the music? What? Yeah, the midsection is... Yeah, I don't care. Let it go. Nobody noticed. I noticed! She didn't notice cos she was on automatic pilot again. Don't you start with all that bollocks. What did I just say to you in there? If I'm such a robot, how come I've had not one, not two, but three different approaches from other skaters? One of whom, and I'm not naming names, but it was Gary Kingston, who could kick eight bells of shit out of you if it did come to a fight over my services. Leanne, just... Gary Kingston, who actually said to me, "He's a nutjob, Leanne. "Ask his first partner, Sandra Elson, "why she isn't with him no more. "He's ice dancing's Billy Bremner, "when he's not faffing about pretending to be Rudolf Nureyev. "So why don't you just ditch him and come and dance with someone "who'll show you what appreciation really looks like? "Cos the truth is, you're wasted on that Christopher Dean, "the stuck-up blond ponce!" Prince. What? Sorry. I... I thought you said blond prince. Blonde ponce. Why would I say prince? I'm having a go at him. Cos he's a bloody pain who doesn't realise what he's got! Yeah, yeah, go. Cos I am. I'm done with you. And you! You're both rubbish. I'm glad you never tried it on with me. I wouldn't have let you. And I let everyone. Excuse me... Do you know the lady that lives in there? Mavis Dean? I live in there. I took it over a couple of weeks ago. Is something wrong? No. Counter duty is something all the girls look forward to. Though I do have to tell you, Jayne, that that is a privilege we grant only after staff have been with us for two years. Having said that, you are given half a day during your training period, so you will get a taste of everything that's on offer. Are you coming straight over, then? What? The pit. The first tour's this afternoon, isn't it? That's an extra tonne in your wage packet at the end of the month. I'm not going down there. I'm not going down the pit. Everyone goes down the pit. Yeah, well, I'm not.

We do jazz, tap, modern, flamenco, swing, belly dancing, line dancing, ballroom, contemporary, Latin, ballet... Ballet. I want to do ballet. OK. I want one-on-one. I mean, I'll need to know the cost, but I've just got my first job, so, as long as it's not prohibitive, then that's what I'm after. I'm an ice skater. But I don't think I'm very intense. You know, fiery. And I'm concerned it might hold us back in the long term. It takes two to tango, isn't that what they say? I just... I want to learn how to make my body look how it feels. That's it, really. You know, I want to transcend my outside, basically. He's a great skater. I mean, technically, he's one of the best I've ever seen. But you see, the thing is, Jayne... We've met, actually. But perhaps you don't remember. But I know you. And, you see, the thing is, for a partnership to work... ...the chemistry has to be right. And if it's not right, well, it doesn't really matter what you do, cos you'll never make a success of it. So you've just got to be brave... and move on. Hey up, buster. You all right? Hey, what's that song...? "School's out forever." I'll take you to the Welfare tonight, we'll have a pint. You'll need to get to know folk. I'm not going down there. Why is everyone assuming that I will? Why, what's wrong? I'm joining the cops. I start in a month. The police? Yeah, I just thought... a nice, secure future. And they're dead clear, aren't they? What's right, what's wrong. I quite fancy that. So all that business just now, the Welfare, the lads, you can forget about that, because we won't ever be strolling down the street together. Not ever, all right? I forgot. Janet rang. She wants you in at 6:30. She thinks she might have found you someone. You're here! Good. And Jayne. Bang on time. Excellent. You've met Christopher, haven't you? Well, you've seen him around, anyway. Well, I've seen you both skate separately. And I think you'd make a rather nice match. So, into hold, please. What? Straight away? Aren't we going to, I don't know, talk or...? No, we're not. I need to see you together. Pelvis to pelvis, nice and tight. OK... Good. So let's start with, erm... Hold on, I've left summat in the locker room. So, how long do you intend to give them? Ten minutes should be plenty. It feels like a lifetime out there. But it saves months, you know, further down the line. Get all that embarrassment out of the way all at once. And then you can just concentrate on the skating. Marvellous. Hey... Rich Tea? Yeah. Good. Sorry, I... I wasn't, erm... No. ...thrusting, I meant. If you fancy a warm-up... Definite. You look a bit sad. Are you all right? Yeah. Just... ...stuff at home.

I'm sorry. I'm here. I missed the five to. What were you doing? Nothing. I was just... Nothing. Just loosening up. OK, let's get going. I don't care how ragged it is, let's just work through it to the end, and we can discuss it afterwards. No... Please! We've talked about this all week. I can't spoon-feed you. The OSPs and the compulsories, I can give you a nudge. But your free has to come from you. Fine, let's break it down. What sort of music are you thinking of using? A theme? A mood, a story? I mean, he was... You were just now, weren't you? No, I was just mucking about. Great. Well, in that case, let's just call it a day, shall we? What? Well, if you can't be bothered... That's wasting our time, that's a waste of time. Well, you're wasting mine. That makes us about equal, doesn't it? I'm away for two weeks. You need to have something to show me when I'm back. Flipping heck...! Vitamin C. Your immune system gets weakened when you're under stress. Stuff your immune system, she's going to dump us unless you can come up with some ideas. Me? Why is it my job? Cos that's what you do. It's why you get people's backs up, always banging on about artistry and feeling it! Have we got time? Yeah, we've got time. 7:30. Most people will still be getting their mouths round a bowl of porridge. Hey, what about the library? What? Well, there's one on Market Square. I ain't been, but... You know, for the story. Well, we should check out Selectadisc an' all for music and the video store. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've heard people on telly saying how such and such a thing inspired them and then they bang on about all the books and films and that that they use like a launchpad. But what we finally put on the ice, that's got to be us. I mean, flipping heck, Chris, you've seen them couples who are dead good technically, but they ain't got any connection with what they're dancing. But we can't be like that. And we won't be, as long as we don't just copy and we find something that we know about and we feel strongly about. You know, in there. And I'm telling you, if we can do that, we'll have cracked it. Yeah... What? No, it's... It's probably daft. Of course it's not daft. Christ, Chris, don't you get it? You're different to other lads. I knew it the first time I saw you. You're... You're passionate and stuff matters to you. And I want some of that. That's why I started skating, cos... I want to go somewhere. Away from Farnborough Road and Clifton and... It's like I want to fly. 'Saturday Night Fever' by the Bee Gees I love this song. Make it... Watch me, watch me... Aye.

I've seen what I need. I've seen you, at last. Tomorrow, we'll go through it all. But we need to have something ready by Saturday. Bristol. Sorry, what? The National Skating Association. Selection meet. An ice dance. Just to be clear, we're going to do that, what me and Jayne have just come up with... this weekend? Well, I don't see why not. Second! We came second! I know! Yeah, all right. You didn't win the Olympics. Well done. It was beautiful. We hardly made any mistakes. No, you didn't, Jayne, you're right. So much so that they've invited you back. To compete at the Oberstdorf next month. What? In Germany. It's not a full international, but it's... I don't care. It's abroad! It's... Wait, hang on, who pays? I'm still on a cadet's wage, and she's on probation till Christmas. They take care of all the essentials. So what do you reckon? Doable? It'll have to be, won't it? Yeah.

Have you seen them? Christopher! I'm trying to talk to you! Yeah, and I had two boiled eggs in either cheek. You'd probably not manage two, smaller mouth. But see how you get on. It's all about maximising opportunity. Stop it! We're in Germany. We're at our first-ever international competition.

You know, we dance our dance. Nothing else matters. Not where we are or what anyone else does. It's just us and our routine, right? Yeah. Yes. There it is, quite exquisite and surely first place for Torvill and Dean. Home, sweet home. What? You look ridiculous. The catsuit. All right! You were so good. What? Tonight. You were. You were dead good. No, you were. You were. Sorry. Sorry. No, I... What are you doing? Nothing. I... It... It's something Leanne said a while back. Leanne? About how it can come between a couple.

Look, I did it because... ...because I really... I really like you. I do you. So... I'm confused. I mean... ...of course I fancy you. You're... beautiful. Only, what we do on the ice, that's such a feeling, and I don't want to ruin that cos of what I do or don't do. You're it. You're my chance. Girls like me don't get to be Ginger Rodgers too often, you know? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right. We... I mean, we do need to be sensible. Partners on the ice, then, that's it. Avoids any... complications, I guess. You're bang on. Anyway, I can't get this off. Once it's on, it's impossible. OK, let's go for the lift. Tight. And... ...extend that body movement, finish off the move. OK, I can straighten that leg more as well. It needs to feel like one movement, as if you're working together. And... Yes, better. Chris, watch your legs. They're coming in too close. Pst, Janet! How are you doing? What are you doing here? I just thought I'd surprise you. Well, it is a surprise.

You know, this is her fault. Janet wasn't the one skating out there. We were. And we looked tired. Chris, you're in the middle of your exams, I'm trying to get through my phone etiquette course. Christ, you want to hear Shirley banging on about how I come across when I speak to our customers. And she's right. I sound exhausted. So... it's not Janet. You know, she tried to be straight with us. She said we're set for bigger things now, and we need a trainer who can really get behind us. Which she couldn't. And we know why, don't we? Cos of him!

You can't do that to me again. You can't leave. That is all you ever do, is leave me! That's all I can do now. Time's moved on, Christopher. This is the present. Everything's settled. I'd just upset it. I adore you. Remember. Vodka tonic, please. You're thirsty. Not surprised, the way you was flying about in there. Ladies' singles. I don't think you was watching, but I saw you. Well impressed. I'm Ella. Ella May. But then again, I may not. Depends on you. Chris... I thought you'd gone home... ...with your mum and dad. No. No, they're still here. Come with us. I mean... We can talk on the way about new trainers and that. It'd be quicker than the bus and... I don't want to fall out with you. I hate rowing. And... we're a good team, aren't we? We bolster each other and... it's horrible feeling like this. Come on, then, blondie, let's have you. Got me wheels round the front. We can put the top down, if you like, it's warm enough. It's an ugly world, Jayne. You might as well join in. I've recorded everything you've ever done. Just listen, in a minute, what he says. And now, the darlings of British ice dance, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Currently lying 11th after their original set pattern and compulsories, but very much hoping to improve on that but very much hoping here with their free dance. We didn't. Which means we should really get on the ice when we're supposed to? So we can get a bit more practice in. I'll... go and check on the Zamboni. Are you all right? Yeah, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? I don't know. You just... ...seem a bit not yourself. Chris, the reason we're together is to dance together, right? So why don't we just concentrate on that? Yeah. Er... I was on two till ten. I didn't have a chance to get changed properly, so... At least you're not wearing your hat. Betty Callaway wants us. I was going to tell you after we finished last night, but, erm... ...she's indicated she'd be happy to take over our coaching. You're kidding? Jayne, she's number one! Yeah, I know. You're both very shy. Which is fine. But we will need to work on it. Your accents, too. There's going to be more and more press from now on. Also, at the Worlds, and when I saw you at Oberstdorf... You were at Oberstdorf? Yes, I train there a lot. Chris, I remember that you smelt of egg. I was in the lift with you. And you were rather too pairsy. Too many side-by-side runs to get up speed and... Look... you've got it, my dears. I know you have. Or I wouldn't be having this conversation with you. And Janet got an awful lot right in getting you focused. But... ...you need a little refining. You need a finishing school. And I'm it. I must have this height at the front.

Well, this is final caution, yeah? Be a better thief. Do not get caught! Well go on, piss off. Go. See you later, lads. Thank you. Cheers. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Had to be done, didn't it? I mean, I was knackered all the time. And it was mind-numbing. No, I... I like this job. But it isn't an option, is it? Not if we want to make a proper fist of the skating. Betty said that. So what do we do now, then? We might as well get down the rink. We've got all afternoon, haven't we? What is going on? How do you mean? Well, that. It's like Oxford Circus. Is it school holidays or something? No, that's next week. Hey, you think it's busy now. I'm sorry, but I can't believe you didn't check before you jacked your jobs in. Access to the rink ain't going to be any different. Very early or very late. Any other time, forget it. We're busy. We can train without being on the ice, all right? Yeah, I know. How much further are we going? I don't know. Netherfield? That's miles. Netherfield? Yeah. That's what you do, isn't it? Netherfield? You increase your mileage. Over time... Chris! Chris! I'm serious. It's burning, right round me ankle. It's cos you're not stretching out. You're running all hunched up. Well, that's just how I run. Sod this, I'm going home. What? I've done enough. And my leg's killing. And you, you've got a bad attitude. Come on! No, you never encourage people. You just moan when it isn't right. That is not true. It is. You're all stick, you are. And some people need a bit of carrot. You might as well run if you're going to go back the way we've come. ♫ "Bolero" by Maurice Ravel Chris! Where have you been? Look, Betty's got held up. So she reckons we should start without her. Try and come up with some ideas for the new free. Cheers, Ted. We've got it now. Cheers. What was it? It was horrible. It's Ravel. 20p. The library was flogging old stock. It's perfect for the warm-up. It does a job, all right? Anyway, it's not important. You, go and get changed. We've got tonnes to get through. Look, wait. I've been down to casualty. That's why I'm late. I've strained me Achilles. It's not torn, though, so that's good. Well, you can't skate with that on. Take it off. No, Chris, I can't train. I've got to rest. We've got to work out the new programme! Are you serious? We're behind, Jayne. Betty says so. Chris, I'm injured. I'm injured cos, apparently, only a lunatic runs nine miles in plimsolls, especially when the furthest they've gone before that is 500 yards to the shop and back. OK, so you're blaming me? I'm not blaming anyone. I'm defending myself cos you seem incapable of thinking of anybody but Christopher Dean. That is bollocks! I'm thinking about Torvill and Dean. I'm thinking about us! No, you never think about us, ever! 'MACK AND MABEL' ON RECORD PLAYER Hey up, duck, are you all right? What have you done? Jayne, come here. All right, lean on me. Let's get you sat down. That's it, just there. Oooh, there. Do you want me to get you a cup of tea? Or I could fetch you a battered sausage from up the road. I'm fine, Dad. I... It's just a strain. What about some Vicks? That's for colds. Well, you can rub it on anything. I'm all right, Dad, honest. It's nice, though, how you fuss. I like it. So... Mack And Mabel? Aye, I know. Yeah. Your mum bought it. Yeah, we went to see it at The Playhouse. Denis Quilley. A cracking night. Mack was Mack Sennet, this big Hollywood producer. And Mabel was Mabel Normand, she's like his leading lady. Yeah? A love story, was it? It was more of a broken love story, really. Cos he was a sod. Right tartar, you know? Laying down the law, cracking the whip. She just adored him. Yeah. She could see he was a genius. Plus, she wanted to make these great pictures with him, which they both dreamed of. And he were that relentless, just about killed her in the end. Really? Is that right? We should get this one, the texture. Yeah, I think you're right. Jayne, you're here! Chris said you'd had to go home, that you were injured. No. I'm raring to go. And... I've got our new free. Mack And Mabel. It's perfect for us. Can you just go back and do that turn again, Chris? Er, yeah. Erm... That's it, I thought so. Just nice and soft. Excellent! You look wonderful together. Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. In first place, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. Cinq virgule neuf. Cinq virgule neuf. Six virgule zero. Six virgule zero. Six virgule zero. In first place, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. There they are, Jayne and Chris with Betty Callaway... Get in there! ...looking understandably ecstatic. A magnificent performance. British, European and now World Champions. Jayne... Come in. Are you all right? My strapping, I'm struggling to get it off. Do you want a hand? No. I mean, I'm fine. It'll take a bit of time, that's all. Well, just one more to nurse it through now. Olympics. And then we'll have the full set. What? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm thrilled. No, I am. World Champions! I can't believe it, really. Us two. Jayne, please, tell me. I don't know, I just... I just thought this... Like, getting here, I'd feel happier. Look, all I know for sure is that we are on track... ...and if we can find a decent routine for Sarajevo, then... ...then we can do it. We can have everything that we have ever wanted. Yeah. I think... I think maybe we want different things now. Why are you saying this? This is... This... It's what we've been fighting for all these years. I'm not bothered about this. Not more than anything. Cos this isn't the reason I started skating with you. And I'm prepared to admit that. Just like I'm prepared to admit that what we're doing now... I'm not sure I want to carry on with it. What? There's no joy to it, Chris. There's no feeling. I don't know what else I can do, cos you won't tell me what's wrong. You don't talk to me any more. And it's sterile because of it, what we put on the ice. It's brilliant and awe-inspiring and it wins medals. But... it's not us. Us, Chris, deep down. I want it to be how it was. Otherwise... Otherwise, you're... ...you're packing it in. No, I'm not. You're saying it. I know the way you're looking at me. I can tell. You know, I thought you were different. What? I thought you were different from all the others. Janet. Leanne. My mum. And you say it's sterile. Well, you know what, Jayne? You're right. You're right, it is sterile. Because every second that I'm out on that ice, I'm holding back a bloody great tide of... ...of the real world. Where we wallow in shit, and we get bored and we find the relationships around us unsatisfying and unremarkable. So, of course, we just drop them like that. So, excuse me if I prefer to put my efforts into making something flawless and sparkling and that sticks around! Except, I thought you'd got that. I thought that you understood that, whenever you let your guard down, whenever you let someone close to you, whenever you love them... ...they just piss all over you in the end. And I thought you wanted to help me make it better. Jayne... What have you got there? The first pair I ever skated in. When I went with the school. Did they present them to you? No. Ted stole them. He were just being thoughtful. He knew how much they meant to me. These were the start of it. Is everything all right? You're meant to be in Oberstdorf, aren't you, training? I've... I've just had a rough few days, Dad, since the Worlds. I just need a bit of time, that's all. I'll be all right. I did ask him to wait downstairs, but he was quite insistent. I'm sorry. It's important. Chris? Hello, Mr Torvill. Hello, Christopher. Right, then, duck. Let's go and check on the crisp situation. Crisps? She's taken over a newsagent. Why aren't you in Germany? Because you're not. Look, I needed to see you. How we left it, some of the stuff that I said... Chris... I want you to dance the Bolero with me. Please. The warm-up? No. Just... Just think about it. OK, it's one rhythm that builds and it builds into this incredible climax and we could dance in and out of the beat and it'd be like this continuous sinewy throb. Go on. It'll look simple, only it won't be. It'll be the hardest thing we've ever danced, but we'll strip it right back. And we can do all the crazy, jumping, lifting stuff. You're right, we've shown that. So now we do the opposite. This'll just be you and me... laid bare. And it'll be raw and it will be beautiful. What's the story? This doomed love. I mean, right the way through it, it's one story. We don't cut away, have different sections, like we normally do. This is a single narrative, start to finish, to match the music. And it's about this young couple who... they meet and they fall in love... ...only, for some reason, they can't be together. But they can't be apart, neither. So... So, in the end, they take their own lives. They jump into this volcano and... ...they die in each other's arms. And the last beat of the music will just be... ...it'll just be you and me... ...lying in the centre of the rink. And there'll be complete silence. Get down on the floor, like this. Just down here. Right, rock the right knee. Yeah, have that there. That's beautiful. Yeah, so do it from here. ♪ We passed upon the stair ♪ We spoke of was and when And you have another view here with a different neckline. And with the gold. I think that's perfect.

That's Bestemianova and Bukin. ...as the 48th Olympic Winter Games finally gets underway here in Sarajevo. At last, we see the British team coming into the stadium now. Turning slowly across this vast disc of white, led by Christopher Dean and right beside him, as ever, Jayne Torvill, ready, finally, to do battle. Is it on? They really have been a winning combination. I bet you wish you'd stuck with him. It could have been you stepping out at the Olympics. Nah. He was sex mad. He wouldn't leave us alone. I had to draw a line in the end. Where did he say? Block C. He didn't get any more specific. Jayne! Dad! You made it! Hello, Christopher. Mr Torvill. Good luck, son. I'm that proud of you. Great Britain minibus! Good luck, Christopher. Just the skating bit now, then. Miss Torvill? Phone call. Chris... I've been knocking on your door. Why aren't you in bed? I thought something had happened. Sleep? Bloody hell, Jayne, it's tomorrow. Everything is tomorrow. How many sugars have you got in there? You've got to calm down. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. So how come you came looking for me? Nothing's happened, has it? No. I mean... my mum's coming out. I got a call from her just now. What? The Daily Mail, they heard she was manning the fort back in Nottingham, so they arranged for someone to go in and replace her and they're flying her out. And she's agreed, has she? They even negotiated. She said they had to refund my dad's coach ticket, and arrange it so that he could jet back with her afterwards. They want your mum to come, too. That's the angle. Sort of. Two adoring mothers in situ at the 11th hour. But she turned them down, don't worry. Good. They asked my mum to try and persuade her. She couldn't make her change her mind, anyway. She said she didn't want to put you off. My mum said that? Tell her she can come. What? That's the number. They gave it to Betty. Ring her. No. Why? Because! You know, I told you. She... She what? She got caught up in something horrible, and the only way she could cope was cutting herself off from... ...everything. And... ...she's your mum, Chris. And she loves you. That's all that matters. That's what I think, anyway. You're really going to do this, aren't you? We need to make sure. One more time. At half four in the morning? And then we come back to the centre and we drop the trailing leg. And that's it. Got it. And finish on the flip over. See you later, then. Yeah! We're all set. Yeah. Betty! There you are. Good luck. George! George! There's Betty. I know Jayne Torvill. I used to work with her. Always got on really well. Miss Torvill, please. Mr Dean, sir. What are you doing? We never do that. You and me.
