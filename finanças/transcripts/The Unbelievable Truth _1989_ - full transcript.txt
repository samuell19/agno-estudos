[wind howling] Excuse me. Are--are you a priest? No, I'm a mechanic. Oh. Where you headed? Home. Uh-huh. And where you coming from? Prison. Where you headed? Long Island. Oh, I ain't going that far. Uh, New York. Uh, all right. Get in. Make it quick though, huh? God, I'm wired. You want to drive? I don't drive. What do you mean, you don't drive? I don't have a license. What? Are you a priest or something? [exhales] I'm a mechanic. Yeah, that's what I thought. So how about it? How about what? Do you want to drive? I don't drive. He doesn't drive. I don't drink. [traffic noise] [clock ticking] [alarm clock] [birds chirping] [explosion sound effect] Where were you last night? Out. Where? Walking. [adults' dialogue echoing] Audry, the high school called again yesterday. Oh, yeah. I forgot to go to school yesterday. Sorry. Honey, you haven't been to school all week. How do you forget to go to school? Pass the sugar, please. How do you forget to go to school? Just keep this up, you won't get accepted by any college in the country. Don't start... I don't want to go to college anyway. Don't start, Audry. Audry, I thought you wanted to be a journalist, a TV anchorwoman like that lady on the 6:00 news. Why are you two so concerned about my college education? The world is going to blow up any day now. Anyway it's hopeless. Give my college money to the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament. A bunch of Goddamn anarchists filling your head with Leftwing nonsense. Of course you're gonna go to college. You're gonna go if I have to drag you there myself. A person doesn't have a chance in the world today without a college education. I agree with your father, Audry. I got accepted. That's great, honey! Congratulations. Here, look, Vic. Harvard?! It's a college. Vic: It's expensive. You can't put a price tag on a thing like that, Vic. You can put a price tag on anything, Liz. Didn't you apply anywhere else? No. Vic: I'm gonna be paying for this the rest of my life. Victor, aren't you proud of her? I'm not going anyway. We'll all be lucky if we're alive in September. Shut up, you. Of course you're going to college. Why, it says right here in the paper that the present workforce between the ages of 21 and 35 is the most highly educated and the highest paid in American history. That's what you have to contend with. But, Dad, history is coming to an end. What's she talking about? The end of the world. By the way, Vic, the washing machine is busted. Audry, the world is not gonna come to an end when there's so many people making so much money. What's this about the washing machine? It's busted. We just bought the damn thing. What's wrong with it? It just shoots water all over the place. Mom, you got any Valium? Hold it a minute. I want to talk about this Harvard thing. Dad, I'm going to be late for school. Bullshit. Vic! I hope you're saving the money you're making at Burger World. I quit. But, honey, didn't you like working at Burger World? "Let us consider some of the possible ways "a person might die in a nuclear attack. "He might be incinerated instantly "by the fireball or the thermal pulse. "He might be crushed to death by the blast wave. "He might receive lethal radiation poisoning "from the local fallout. "He might die of starvation "because the economy had collapsed "and no food was being grown. "He might die of cold for lack of heat or clothing, "or of exposure for lack of shelter. "He might be killed by people seeking food "or shelter which he obtained. "He might be killed by exposure to the sun "because the damaged ozone layer was no longer filtering out ultraviolet rays." Audry: What's with the suit, Emmet? Oh, I just got it. Do you like it? I think it's gross. I like it. I told my parents I quit my job at Burger World. You know, things are really looking up for me, Audry. The school psychologist says I'm apathetic. The whole world's out there in front of me, and I'm ready for it. I told him about the holes in the ozone layer and he said he didn't believe me. You know, a guy like me can go far, and that's exactly what I plan to do. Thousands of people across Eastern Europe still experiencing lung complications because of Chernobyl, and he's telling me these should be that the happiest years of my life. Well, I'm going to take this world in my teeth, chew it up, and spit it back out again. Emmet, we're on the brink of global extinction. The wheels of fortune are rolling in my direction. Every night I go to bed dreaming about suicide, and then I feel ashamed, and I cry myself to sleep. My friends all like you a lot, and my parents do, too, and-- [airplane] Emmet, you're not even listening to me. I am so. And to tell you quite frankly, Audry, I'm worried. About what? About you. Why? Well, because lately you seem so, you know, apathetic. Oh, Emmet, you're a dick. Aw, come on, Audry. Don't be sore. I mean it. I'm worried. But you don't even listen to me when I'm talking. I do so. And you've been talking like a crazy person lately. Everybody says so. And, Audry, look what you're wearing. Look what you're wearing! Hey, this cost $185. Congratulations. Hey, listen, Audry. I know you've been a little mixed up lately. I'm not mixed up. I'm depressed. Whatever. Shh! What? [birds chirping] Listen. [crow squawking] I don't hear anything. Bombs. Listen, Audry. What I'm trying to tell you is that I don't want to lose you. You never had me, you idiot. What do you mean? I don't know. Emmet, I don't want to go out with you anymore. You disgust me. You mean that... you mean you-- I don't want you. Aw, but, Audry! Sorry. How are you, Pearl? [vehicle horn blares] Excuse me for seeming so forward, but, uh, you're really quite attractive. No, really, I mean it. See? Photographer. Have you ever, uh, thought about getting into modeling? Shit. What happened? She passed out. Pearl. Pearl! What happened? You passed out, and this guy here brought you in. Hello, Josh. Hello. You're late. Sorry. I got to go. So I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks. Sure. How do you like your eggs? Does this belong to you? Pearl, what do you say? Marry me. No. Hey, Emmet. Emmet? Emmet, what's the matter? Emmet, you look like shit. She doesn't want me. Who doesn't want you? Audry. Aw, Jesus, Emmet. Is that all? Is that all? Audry is my entire life. Relax. I'll never love anybody else, ever. I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was so serious. Get in the Goddamn car. No! Emmet, you're overreacting. What's the point? What is a man without the woman that he loves? Nothing, a hollow shell. Oh, fuck, Emmet. She's in love with somebody else. Come on. Ease up. Eh, she's going through a phase. She's a girl, Emmet. You know how girls are. She's sleeping with some guy who's got a bigger cock. I know it. That's my fucking daughter you're talking about, asshole. But she's a girl. You said so yourself. There's a difference between a girl and a slut. All girls are sluts. Have you and Audry been having sex? Of course we have. You bastard. I trusted you. Get real, Mr. Hugo. It's 1988. Audry and me have been having sex since we were 15. You're lying. It's the truth. I'm warning you, you little peckerhead. You stay away from Audry or I'll break your Goddamn neck. Mr. Hugo, I wouldn't dirty my hands on that promiscuous little bitch if you gave me money to do it. [door opens, then shuts] Hi. Hello. Can I help you find something? I'm looking for a book about Washington, George Washington, the president. The first president? Right. There aren't any. At all? Here. Right. You need new shoes. Do you work here? I happen to be a big fan of George Washington myself. Really? He represents a lot of things I admire. For instance, he's singular, one. $1 bill. Just look at the guy. He's not very attractive, but he's got dignity. He was a farmer. I can't help thinking that if he were alive today doing the job he did then, leading that particular revolution, he'd be locked up or worse. All of them--Franklin, Paine, Jefferson, they'd be executed. Well, maybe not executed. Oh, don't put it past people. I don't trust anyone. Uh, so what do you do? I'm a mechanic. You work around here? I don't work anywhere just yet. You need a job? Yeah. [indistinct chatter in adjoining room] Go to this place. [rock guitar playing] Hi, Vic. What's that still doing here? Man, Vic, this car is really twisted. It was supposed to be done by Wednesday. Tuesday. What's wrong with it? Mechanic with guitar: Got me. I thought I fixed it the last time. Vic: Last time? Yeah. He had it in here last month. What you're saying is we didn't do the job right the first time. You got it, Chief. Jesus Christ, Mike. Gee, Vic, is something bothering you? What did you do to it last time? Back off. I didn't do anything to it, all right? Vic: Yeah. Can I help you? I'm a mechanic. I'm looking for work. Nah. No work here. Sorry. Hey. You know anything about foreign cars? What's wrong with it? The clutch, I think. Worn out? Could be. It sticks real bad. Two hours. What? I can fix it in two hours. You a priest or something? What are you still doing here? I told you, I ain't hiring. Mike: Look, Vic... He says he can fix this beast in two hours. Count them. Two hours. Where'd you work before? Upstate New York. Upstate New York where? Uh, Ossining. Where in Ossining? In prison. I fixed cars in prison. So what do you think? It's him. I'm sure it's him. It's been a long time. Yeah. I wasn't so sure before, but now I'm positive. We got a fucking mass murderer in the garage. He's not a mass murderer. Well, that's what I heard. Mike, you're so fucking simple. Look, I heard that he and the girl shot her parents, then they went on the road, and then he shot her, too. If he killed all those people, he'd be in prison for life. Well, that's what I heard. Don't Pearl know what happened? Pearl doesn't talk about it. Well, what happened as far as I know, he killed the father because something like the girl wanted him to. Then she flipped out and killed herself. Well, what about her mother? I never heard anything about the mother. Well, what's he doing now? He's fixing the Goddamn Mercedes, you knucklehead. Why aren't you helping him? He just needed me for the beginning part. I'm telling you, you should see him work, Vic. He's fucking amazing. He knows exactly what he's doing. Doesn't hardly make a sound. Yeah? Yeah. He's good. Whoo, so good. Come on. Thanks. What brings you back to town, Josh? It's the only place I know outside of prison. All your family's gone, ain't they? The house is still there. How long you been out? Two days. What are you gonna do now? I'm going to find myself a job. Hold on. Look, I can't pay you much. I don't need much. Yeah, well. I can start right away. There's some coveralls back there in the office. [music on radio] What's this? What kind of question is that? Just asking. It's fish. Really? You asked for the special, right? Yeah, OK. OK, it's fine. Hey. Listen, uh, guys probably say this to you all the time, but have you ever been a model? What? I could swear I saw you in a magazine or an ad or something. What are you trying to pull? You don't have money to pay for this, do you? Of course I do. I'm a professional photographer. Here's my camera. Oh, you're a photographer, huh? Mm-hmm. Eddie, we have some kind of troublemaker out here. No, no, look. I'll pay, I'll pay, OK? OK? Here. So you're sure it's him? It's him-- Josh Hutton. He came back to town. Aren't you scared to be working with him? Yeah. Sometimes he gets this real strange glint in his eye, you know, like he's remembering something really horrible. Oh, man. I-- I would be terrified. What did he do? He raped and killed Pearl's older sister and then shot her father, and, uh, they never found the mother. He did not. He did so. Him and Pearl's sister had a deal. She wanted to kill her father, but she couldn't do it herself, so she got Josh to do it. Why did she want to kill her father? I don't know. There was probably some sick incestuous relationship going on, and it was driving her crazy. How gross. Maybe, because she killed herself afterward. Photographer: The girl killed herself first. Waitress: What the hell do you know about it? She killed herself because her old man wouldn't let her marry Josh Hutton. Then Josh goes after the old man, shoots him. Then he goes back and kills his own Goddamn father. Emmet: Oh, bullshit. That doesn't sound right at all. You better watch your mouth, kid. I'm not a kid. Oh, no? Prove it. Nice! Mike: Josh shot his own father, too? Emmet: Well, doesn't Pearl know anything about this? Pearl don't talk about it. And I'm warning you right now, kid, don't even ask her. Don't call me kid. You know, that is why Pearl is the way she is. She was just a little kid. This really messed her up good. There's nothing wrong with Pearl. Photographer: You got it all fouled up. Mr. Hugo's crazy to hire a guy like that. Why? He's a good auto mechanic. And he was real nice to Pearl, though. He carried her right in off the highway. I don't think the criminal element can ever be completely rehabilitated. Mike: Really? If you hurry, you might catch "Romper Room." "Life of George Washington, Father of Our Country." Thanks. What's this one? "Misanthrope." Moliere. It's a play. What's a misanthrope? Somebody who doesn't like people. I star in it. I mean in class. We read it in class. Are you the misanthrope? No. I wanted to be, but they wouldn't let me play a man, so instead I play a flirt. Oh. Is it an interesting role? Being a flirt? Mm-hmm. Well, sometimes. But the thing about flirting is that it leads to harder things. Is that bad? No, it isn't bad. It's just that it turns out pretty badly for the woman I play. What happens? She can't stop flirting. Ever? It's just the way some people are. She flirts herself to death. Hmm. It's a sad play. Well, she doesn't die, actually. It's just that the only man who really loves her has impossible standards. Hmm, that's too bad. Yeah, it is. Well, does it have a happy ending? Nobody gets what they want, and they all go away frustrated and sad. A tragedy. Vic: Audry, what are you doing in here? [impact torque wrench buzzing] What? You know what. What? What happened between you and Emmet? I'm driving to work this morning. I see the kid standing in the middle of the road, immobilized by grief. Emmet wears boxer shorts with dollar signs all over them. I don't want to hear about Emmet's Goddamn underwear. What are you so dreamy about? The world's going to end tomorrow, remember? Right now it's today. It's not tomorrow. Audry, did you go to school today? No. Listen, Audry, I've been thinking about this Harvard thing. Let's...let's make a deal. A what? A deal. If I give $1,000 to that nuke-head Commie charity organization of yours, will you forget about Harvard and go to the community college? Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious. I don't want to go to college, any college. Will you just give it a try? Would I have to study communications? What else would you study? Literature. Literature? What the hell are you going to do with literature? Read. I don't know. Would this be a yearly arrangement or would I be obligated to the full four years in return for the one donation? That would depend. On what? On how well you do the first year. A thousand a year if I pass all my classes. Only if your grade-point average is high. Medium. High. Only for literature. I won't do that for communications. No. Communications or nothing. OK. But I have the option to drop out after the first year. Only if your grade-point average is high. You have to write the check today. Five hundred now and the remainder at the end of the first semester. It's only fair, Audry. Normal business procedure. OK. Then it's a deal? Yeah, sure. [music playing] Assets. Any kind of assets. You got to have them. The whole fucking country's run on credit. I hate that. Yeah, but it works out for guys like you and me, though. I don't trust that speculation crap. Money that's not connected to anything. I like to see money; I like to lay my hands on it. Yeah, but you got to be leveraged. What? Leveraged. You look wonderful in that dress. Really? Beautiful. Great. So who are you waiting for? Oh, no one. Vic: Audry, come here a minute. Audry, I want you to meet Mr. Todd Whitbread. We know each other from years and years ago. Todd here is a commercial photographer. And so, Todd, uh, tell Audry what we were talking about here. Listen to this, Audry. Oh, like your father was saying, Audry, I'm a commercial photographer. And I do mostly christenings and weddings, that kind of thing. But I got a couple of spreads in a couple of magazines. Well, anyway, like I was saying to your father, you know, you really got a look. See, you have what they call poise, a real presence, poise. That's what you have, poise. And that's a valuable thing. Poise. Todd: Oh, everyone thinks so. And in my professional opinion, I think you could, if you wanted to, be a, uh, a model. Dad, what's he getting at? He--he's talking about work, Audry. There's a lot of money to be made in modeling, especially for a girl like you who's got great...poise. What Todd's trying to say, Audry, is that maybe you could become a model. But I'm going to college. Well, of course you're going to go to college. But maybe you could make some money to help pay for college. If I wasn't going to college, I'd be a carpenter. Since when? Audry: Since always. Jesus was a carpenter. He was a radical. I like radicals. Audry, knock it off. Dad, if I'm gonna have to help pay for college, then I'm going to study literature. That wasn't the deal. Well, the deal's different now. What about the charity donation? It still holds. You drive a hard bargain, Audry. Uh, you can make a lot of money fast if you make the right connections. There, Audry. See? How do you make these connections? Well, first, you need a portfolio. A what? Portfolio. It's French. It's a bunch of shots of Audry here with, uh, different outfits, different makeup, different hairstyles to show her off as a model. Well, where the hell am I going to get one of those? Well, it's up to you, but, uh, I'd give you a good deal on the shots myself. And I can also introduce Audry around, help her make some connections. How much? Well, it's hard to say off the bat, but, uh, 750 bucks. What?! 650. For photographs? It's a necessary and important investment in a modeling career. But I hardly know you. How'd you get in here? [indistinct chatter] What are you doing here? I deserve some kind of an explanation. I mean, really, after all we've been through. What have we been through? Well, everything. It's another guy, right? Did you really have a fight with my father? It's Bill, isn't it? Oh, Emmet, please. I knew it. You said 550? 650. I don't know. Look, Mr. Hugo. You can make a lot of money off this girl. She's a good-looking kid. Trust me. Listen... you get her into this modeling thing and you'll make your money back in no time. 600 or nothing. It's a deal. It all just seems so empty to me. What does? Everything does. The house, these clothes, the party. Singer: * He doesn't know what he's missing * * And he doesn't pay attention to me... * What was that? Excuse me? You said something. Yeah, I said something. So what's it to you? Well, I'm not so sure that I like what you said. You don't even know what I said. Oh, ho ho! Yes, I do. I don't know. Does he? You got me. What did I say? I don't care what you said. I just think it's about time that you guys left this party. We just got here. Look, pal, what's your problem? Listen, you want to go outside? No, I don't. Well, I think that you and I better go outside and settle this thing. What thing? Look, pal, you're bugging me. No, you're bugging me. Come on. Let's just get out of here. No way. We ain't done nothing. You guys are making trouble, man. I ain't starting anything. You want to go outside? Yeah. Do you want to go outside? Yeah, I want to go outside. Come on. let's go outside and finish this thing off once and for all. OK. Wait a minute. Ready? Go. Pearl, let's get out of here. OK. Singer: * Good intentions... * Come on! * They aren't good enough * * You know I want to believe you * * But I'm lacking trust * * The world is... * [inaudible conversation, instrumental music plays] There. What is it? Do you hear it? Bombs? Could be. Nearby? No. They wouldn't drop the bomb on the weekend, would they? Who knows? It could be some freak accident happens and, boom, the history of human endeavor is flushed down the toilet. Makes you think, you know? I mean, who would do something like that? It could be anybody. Everybody's got nuclear capability now, even the Pakistanis. They've got this new bomb, a nuclear bomb, that fits inside a suitcase. I don't want to think about that. No. Let's not think about that. Let's just lie here. [heavy sigh] Pearl, do you like older men? Sometimes. I met a man yesterday. An older man? I think so. He looked older. He was older than me. What was he like? Oh, he had a history. You could tell just by looking at him. Be careful of men with histories. He was poor. He was hungry. He had no possessions. He had no place even to live. And he was, like, entirely dressed in black. Who is it? His name is Joshua, Joshua Hutton. Pearl, what is it? I have to go now. Pearl? No, really. I have to work later this afternoon. I really need to get some sleep. Bye. Fucking cowards. Ooh. Emmet, what happened? Audry, is that you? Knock it off. Emmet, what happened? I kicked ass. But why? Well, because I love you, Audry. That's too bad, Emmet. [airplane] Mom, what do you know about Josh Hutton? Josh Hutton? Why do you want to know about Josh Hutton? Dad just hired him. Really? Yeah. What do you know about him? Well, he killed some people. Who did he kill? Pearl's sister. When was this? This was a few years before he killed her father. I don't remember any of this. It was a long time ago. You were only two. And Pearl never talks about it. He seems like a nice man. You think so? I mean, after he's killed your sister and your father? Things happen. People make mistakes. I can see how your sister was a mistake, but he threw your father down a flight of stairs. I think--I think he seems like a nice man, and you like him, right? He doesn't seem like a killer. Maybe he isn't. I mean, he hasn't killed anyone recently, has he? I don't think so. I knew he had a history. Fundamental scientific laws govern the ability of an engine to convert energy in the fuel to an energy that can make the car move. Scientific principles, huh? Yeah. It's what they call the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Hey, where'd you learn all this stuff? In prison. I read this book. Hey, why'd you kill Pearl's father? I suppose I was pretty angry. You suppose? I mean, don't you know? Christ. You killed a man. No. Neither of us wanted to kill each other, I think, when we got started, but we just kind of lost control, you know? Why did you go over to his place, anyway? I wanted to apologize to him for killing his daughter. And then you threw him down a flight of stairs? Yeah, something like that. Well, why'd you run? I was scared. Well, it sounds like it was an accident. Killing a man is killing a man. Yeah, I guess so. How is Pearl, anyway? She's OK. She's a difficult woman. How about you? You got a main squeeze? No. Ever? No. Whew. Ouch! And the first thing you notice about having a girlfriend, you know, like right off the bat when you start staying over at her house and everything, so you start cleaning yourself a lot better. Really. Yeah, no shit. Like, you just start paying more attention to everything like-- I don't know-- cleaning your teeth before you go to bed and worrying about washing your back. Your back? Yeah, your fucking back, right down the middle. It's almost impossible to do. And who the hell thinks about it anyway? Girls do, I guess. I suppose it must get kind of dirty down there, though, with all that sweat and everything. But you never see the Goddamn thing. Underwear. Suddenly I'm buying underwear up the wazoo. Must be really different when somebody's seeing you without your clothes on all the time, though. Yeah, damn straight. So how do you stand this celibacy shit? How does anybody stand anything? Being in prison for all those years helps. Well, didn't you get any before the crash? My friends were always making fun of me. So one night I took Pearl's sister to the movies. I was determined. I knew she liked me and-- well, she was as pretty as Pearl is. Anyway, we drove to the movies, and we kissed and all that, and then I picked up a six-pack of beer and drove out to this place that I knew. You sure you don't want a beer? No. I'm fine. Aren't you curious? Most of the time. But you see, I killed a man. I never thought I'd be able to do that. I mean, when you've done something unimaginable, when you've done it before you ever even thought about it, when you see how easy it is, well, then everything is put into this new perspective. Suddenly things you thought were the most important thing in the world have no more significance than anything else because you've done the unimaginable. You've done what you thought was impossible. And then you see-- well, you see you can do anything. Hey, you ain't a homo, are you? No. I mean, I don't have anything against guys liking other guys, as long as they don't like me. You know what I'm saying? Sure. I thought I was a homo once. Really? Yeah, fucking unbelievable. What happened? I joined the Marines. They straightened my shit right out. See my tattoo? Liz: My, Audry. You look so elegant in this one. Audry: You should have seen some of the awful clothes they had there. Well, I like this one. Yeah, that one's all right. Just kind of tight, though. It shows off your breasts well. Will you two shut up? I think Mr. Whitbread did a really nice job. Very professional. He better have. I paid him 750 bucks for those. Audry, will you get your dirty hands off them! They're clean. Wow. Audry, you really do have some figure. Mom, cut it out. Don't be silly, Audry. Flaunt it while you have it. I'm just about losing mine. Ma, you look OK. Liar. Well, you look great. Don't she, Dad? Look. Can't the two of you see I'm trying to eat? Ma, straighten your back. I learned this today. What, like this? Audry, this is... Vic: Look, right there, in the raincoat with the umbrella. Holy shit. Look at that. Ain't that something? Yeah. Audry right there in the Goddamn newspaper. She made 500 bucks for one day's work. No shit. Damn straight. Hey, Josh, look at this. You know Vic's daughter, Audry, right? A pretty girl. Right. OK. Let's get back to work. Josh, you, uh, almost finished with that Mustang? Yeah. I just got to set the points on it and then I'll start on the Firebird. Right. Let's get them all finished up today, huh? Right. Hey, don't you think you're riding him a little too hard? He can take it. Liz: Well, I think that maybe it would be a good thing. If she's not sure what she wants to study, maybe it would be worthwhile for her to take a year off and just work and make some money. Dad, I promise it-- it'll just be a year. At the end of the year I'll make so much money, maybe I'll be able to pay for college all by myself. Vic: We had a deal, remember? I remember. I held up my end. I appreciate that. Shit. Audry, eat your vegetables. [traffic noise] Emmet, you look terrible. I'll tell you, Audry, I'm a wreck. You look really nice in that dress. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm going to kill myself. Oh, Emmet. Don't be maudlin. Then I'll kill somebody else. Where you going anyway? To work. Oh, not modeling. Sweaters. Oh, I hate seeing you in those advertisements where other men can slobber all over you. I make a lot of money. Yeah, well, since when are you so interested in making money? Since I started earning it. And why are you so happy lately? I mean, don't you know the world's fucked? Did you read the paper today? Emmet, I know the world's fucked. I don't read the papers anymore. And have you bathed lately? Emmet, really, you smell. You're in love with that homicidal auto mechanic, aren't you? Ugh! Emmet, I'm going to kill you. Ha ha! It won't last. I know it won't last. Emmet, you know what the ancient Greeks said about happiness? Fuck the ancient Greeks. Here's my ride. Don't go. Emmet, tie your shoe. Todd: Isn't it something? [wolf whistle] Hey, beautiful. Emmet: Hey. Hi. Good afternoon, Mr. Hutton. You don't have to call me mister. What am I supposed to call you? Well, you can call me anything you like, but you don't have to call me "mister." I think I'll call you reverend. Oh, like a priest? Don't you like it? Well, I admire people who are dedicated to things. Why didn't you come to the party? I had no clothes, no money. Oh. I'm sorry. It's OK. Do you have any money now? Well, I have what I need. Look. It's my foot. No kidding. They gave me almost $1,000 to put the shoe on and let them photograph my foot. That's a pretty foot. Thanks. Uh, listen, do you want to take a walk somewhere? Where to? Anywhere. Why? There's something I want to tell you about me. I don't want to hear it. It's important. What good will it do? Ah, I think you should know. I already know. Does it make a difference? No. Audry! Audry, listen to me. It's for your own good. I don't want you to associate with that man. But why? He's a mass murderer. Dad, cut it out. He's a loaded pistol. No telling when he's going to go off. If he's so horrible and dangerous, why did you hire him? Well, I'm going to let him go tomorrow. Oh, you wouldn't dare. Oh, yes, I would. Dad, without Josh, your whole business would fall down around your ears. Don't tell me about my business, Audry. OK? I know you need a good mechanic. He's a good mechanic. Since when do you know so much about auto repair, huh? Look, Audry, why do you want to go and get involved with a mechanic from around here for? Next year you're gonna go away to college-- Maybe I won't go to college. Don't start, Audry. You promised. We made a deal, right? We made a deal. You can't back out on it now. If you don't fire him, if you don't fire him, I won't see him again. What are you up to? I'm not up to anything. If I keep him on, you'll keep away from him? [sighs] Yeah. You promise? You're making a bargain, Audry. You got to stick to it. I see him once more. I have his wrench. Why the hell do you have his wrench? Once more. You promise? Promise. And you got to go to college in the fall. OK, for literature. No, communications, broadcasting. OK. But it's got to be Harvard, OK? All right. But you got to model full-time before you go to college and give me back all the money I gave to that bomb squad charity of yours. All right. It's a deal. Is there something else? You know, Josh, you make a difference around here. I'm just doing my job. Right. I think I'll give you a raise. Whatever you think is fair. An extra 50 bucks a week. What do you say? Thanks. OK. I don't want you coming anywhere near Audry. Got it? Hello, Pearl. Hello. I just wanted to apologize. Don't. Just let's not talk about it, OK? I believe people get what they deserve in the end. [music playing on radio] I can't believe you let her do this. Victor, it's only an underwear advertisement. She's half-nude. She's wearing underwear and a bra. Girls at the beach wear as little as that, less. There's a difference between bathing suits and underwear. She was paid good money for that. Why can't she model sweaters or raincoats? You were the one that encouraged her to go into modeling in the first place. [knock on door] Audry. Hi. Thanks. I have your wrench. Are you OK? This is a really nice house. But your knee. Oh, it's nothing. Here. Sit down. Thanks. I got some Band-Aids inside. No, it's OK. The, uh, house belonged to my father. It's been vacant for years. Do you like the book? Oh, yeah. It's great. Thanks. Um, I have others. Books? Uh, no, wrenches. I have plenty down at work. But this is yours, right? This is your own personal wrench? Yeah. I thought so. So I thought I'd return it to you. Why? Because I thought you'd need it. Well, it's true I might. But, um, I mean, if you need it, you can use it. Really? Sure. Thanks. What's that? Um, these are planetary gears. What does it do? Well, it's, um, the transmission in a car. Right. How does it work? Uh, well, I think it's a little bit complicated. I have all the time in the world. Oh, you really want to know. I think it's really interesting what people do. I mean, when they do something that they love. Because when you do something that you love, no matter what it is, when you do something that you love, you do it well. And, um, when you do something well, then you feel useful, and it's important to feel useful, I think, because then, you know, well, there's--not so much-- but there's so much in life that seems pointless. Well, OK. An automatic transmission... There are manual transmissions, too. They do the same thing, just a bit differently. Um...a transmission works by changing which gears transmit, uh, power in the engine to the power in the wheels of the car. Um, automatic transmissions use planetary gears. Do you follow? Uh-huh. You see here. This is the sun gear here in the middle. Do you see here? [Josh's phrases looped] You got the ring gear This is the sun gear here in the middle and the planet... around the circumference. The sun gear is attached to the input shaft... Well, the output shaft is attached to the planet gears... by clamping the ring gear... You got two gear ratios available by either clamping the ring gear... and engaging the belt, That locks the planet gears... releases, in this case, the clutch. that locks the planet gears to the ring... creating a seal... when this gear set is locked. Will you make love to me? Wait here. Get out of here, Audry. Go on. Vic: What do you mean, you want to move out? Someone's offered me an apartment in New York City for six months. No way. Liz: But, Victor, she works in the city all the time. She spends almost $100 a month just on train fare. So what? She can afford it. Christ. The damn kid makes more than me. [loud traffic noise, indistinct chatter] [glass breaks] [indistinct chatter] What do you want? I just want to explain. There's nothing to explain. Thanks for lending me the book. I have a library card now. What are you reading? History. History is going to come to an end soon. Why are you so sure the human race is going to kill itself? Because it can. Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will. The human race has never invented anything it didn't use. True. But that's not the last word, is it? What's the last word? I don't know. Faith, maybe. Which one? "Faith" or "maybe"? I'd like to see you again. It's too late. You had your chance. Let me explain. I...I have a deal to keep. Fuck the deal. There are rules. Break them. I can't. My father's made good on his end of the deal. What deal? Everything in life is just deals. You can't get anything for nothing. Unless you have nothing to begin with. Are you telling me that I should feel sorry for you? No. I'm not talking about me at all. I have nothing to feel sorry about, Mister hot shot auto mechanic philosopher, and I know exactly what I'm doing, so just drop dead. You can't have faith in people, only the deals you make with them. People are only as good as the deals they make and keep. I know what you need. Excuse me. You need a woman. Oh? That girl is crazy. I know, but I like her. But she's leaving town. So I've heard. So come on. What do you say? I know what you need. Excuse me? You need a woman. Oh? That girl's crazy. I know, but I like her. But she's leaving town. So I've heard. So, come on. What do you say? I know what you need. Excuse me? You need a woman. Oh? That girl's crazy. I know, but I like her. She's leaving town. So I've heard. So come on. What do you say? I know what you need. Excuse me? The girl's crazy. Vic: Audry makes up her own mind. If she wants to live in the city and earn her own keep, what's that got to do with me? She's 18 now. She does what she wants. Yeah, but I can't stand it. Every single magazine I open, I see her. Emmet, you got to pull yourself together. Well, how can you stand it? All these complete strangers ogling her. It's better than you ogling her in the flesh. Besides, she's only gonna do it for a year. Then she's going to go to Harvard and study journalism. That's what she really wants to do, you know. This modeling stuff is just a phase. Mike, what the hell are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Shut up and get off the boat. Oh, hi, Mrs. Hugo. How are you? Hi, Josh. Hey, I heard about Audry's picture in the Sunday "Times." Yeah. Three pictures. It's a whole, you know, spread. You must be really proud of her. We are. We're going to go to church now and then we're going to go by the paper and have a few people back to the house. That's nice. Josh... Josh, you go into the city occasionally, don't you? Well, every once in a while. Oh, good. How about tomorrow? Would you take these earrings in to Audry for me? She's out of the country right now, but she'll be back around 2:00. Come on, Liz. Let's go. Ahh, Josh, uh, if you get a chance, take a look at that hydraulic jack. It's been sticking all week. Right. [church bells ringing] [baby talk] [children playing] Hi, bro. Hi. Liz: Oh, look. Everyone's here. This is so exciting. It's killing me. [newspapers hit sidewalk] She's got nothing on. Not in this one either. Well, I think it's an ad for jewelry, I think. Liz: She's absolutely naked. Pearl: You don't see much. Liz: You see enough. Pearl, let's go back and put some charcoal in the barbeque. Vic: Hold it! I know what you slobs are thinking. You're thinking she's a fucking slut. Well, I want to tell you people something. You people make me want to throw up. You think what she does is easy? It's hard work. Why, you think she just gets up there and takes her clothes off, huh? Nah, it's a skill. And she gets paid damn well to do it. Can any of your people make $1,000 a day, huh? Huh? Why, she's in Europe right now. Why, why you'd all like to go on vacation. You'd all like to drive nice cars. So why hold it against her when she gets it? Mike: Hey, come on, Vic. We don't hold anything against her. Vic: I can see it in your eyes. You're all saying, "How could he let her do it? Doesn't he have any shame?" Well, I want to tell you, the only thing that I'm ashamed of is that I didn't think of it sooner. There's money to be made out there and if you have to get your Goddamn hands dirty to get it, well, then so what? [bells ringing] Singer: * There's a party on the cliffs * * Everybody's going * * There'll be lots of everything * * They'll bring * * Last Sunday morning * * You thought that you knew better * * Now you know... * Josh. Vic, Mike. Um, Mrs. Hugo I just wanted to say, uh, I don't think this is right. And then there's that one. Who? Josh? He's OK. A Goddamn mass murderer always making eyes at my daughter. I had to send her away to live in the city. I had no choice. Look, I don't think you got to worry about Josh. What are you talking about? Give me that bottle. Well, he's not very interested in girls. What do you mean? You mean he's a fag? No. He's--he's like a priest or something. Ah, Mike, no man is like a priest. Priests aren't even like priests when it comes to women. Well, it's different with Josh. I mean, all he ever thinks about is engines. He was telling me this stuff the other day ago. You wouldn't believe it. I mean, all this scientific shit. Amazing. He doesn't have time to think about anything else. Look if you ask me, Audry would be safer around Josh than she would be around anybody. You think so? Absolutely. Josh: I mean, it's right but I don't think it's what Audry wants. But isn't it what you want? It's what I want. Maybe she doesn't know what she wants. Well, that's what I mean. How are you, Josh? Glad you could stop by. Come over here for a minute. I want to talk to you. Josh, have a seat. Look, Josh, this ain't easy for me to say. I know you like Audry. And, well, to be completely out in the open and upfront about everything, Audry is crazy about you. You look surprised. But listen to me, Josh, I ain't kidding you. The girl sleeps with your crescent wrench. Well, I appreciate your saying that. Look at me. Take tomorrow off. She's flying in from Europe tomorrow afternoon sometime. I think it would be a great surprise for her to find you when she got home. Here. Here's her address. She's living in the city. She's living with a friend. And here. Here's $500. Um, no, Mr. Hugo. Shut up and take the money. Here. Take it. Don't be so Goddamn polite. Take her out to, uh, the movies, uh, a play. Take all the freaking cabs you want. Show her a good time. You know how girls are. You got to spend some money on them. They eat it up. Look, Josh, you know I'm not a real romantic type, and I think this could be a really beautiful thing. Vic: Mike, what the hell are you doing? [buzzing] Hey, aren't you the guy that-- Hey, man, back off. It wasn't me. I wasn't even there. Are you going to play something? Maybe. You want a cigarette? No, I don't want a cigarette. You know, I ain't a beggar man. I'm an entertainer, an artist. I don't drink. What? I don't drink. Bullshit. Everybody drinks. I don't. Why the hell not? Hey, are you a priest? I'm a mechanic. Really? Mm-hmm. My wife's ex husband, he's a mechanic. He drinks. Well, I don't. I don't believe you. You don't believe I don't drink? No, I don't believe you're a mechanic. I am. I think you're a man of God. I'm a mechanic. So why don't you have a drink with me? What, am I--am I not good enough for you? Last time I took a drink, I got into a car crash and I killed a girl. No. Yeah. That's enough to drive you to drink. I've been in prison. They put you in jail for a car accident? No, no for that. A couple of years later, I got into an argument with the girl's father. I killed him, too. No shit! Yeah. How? I pushed him down a flight of stairs. Why did you do that? Well, he was hammering away at my face pretty bad, so I kept laying into his chest with everything I had. Next thing you know, boom. Dead? Broken neck, smashed skull. I didn't even see it happen. You got a cigarette? Yeah. [playing harmonica] Do we have to listen to those bums making all that racket? I like them. Come on, Audry. You disgust me. Well, why do you live here, then, if you won't let me touch you? Because I can, it's free, and I'm greedy. Nothing is free, Audry. Greedy people know that. I could throw you out. But you won't. Don't count on it. Here's money for the rent. I don't want your money. Money is all I have. You know, you wouldn't be living like this if it wasn't for me. You're making a lot of money off me too, pal. Well, you're getting a damn good deal having me as your personal manager. But you're still not satisfied, are you? "The immediate effects of a 20-megaton bomb are not different in kind from those of..." Come on, Audry. You got to play the game. Life ain't pretty. You got to make compromises. Life is all compromises. You don't get something for nothing. "...from both bombs can ignite newspapers 15 miles away..." You could do a lot worse than a guy like me. I'm not a rich man, but I'm doing OK for a guy my age. I'm leveraged. "A barely imaginable horror lies..." I have money and real estate. I own art-- 2 Andy Warhol prints. Valuable stuff. "and threatens to break through into our normal life at any time..." That car outside-- do you know how much that baby cost... "...inescapable truth about our lives today "that at any given moment, each and every one of us could become a broken and confused animal..." See, I've been smart. Assets. Tons of assets. And I'm in great shape. "...scratching the surface of the earth..." I go to the most expensive gym in town. for some small sign of life..." I have nothing. I don't want anything. I want you. Is that all? You owe me. We had a deal. We made no deal. We had an understanding. I never said I understood anything. Do you really think I'd let you live here out of the goodness of my heart? [glass breaks] Oh, my God. My fucking vase. [wind chimes] Josh? How are you, Pearl? Can I talk to you? I'm not much in the mood for talking right now. It's important. Would you like to go down to the water? Let's go to my house. Can we walk? [vehicle horn honking] Man on radio: Having trouble finding-- finding the right size. Second man on radio: Do you know what you should do? Go over there. Pick up the socket first, right over here. Then put it on the ratchet. Yeah... [bell ringing] Hey, you guys seen Pearl? Oh, she just left. With Josh Hutton. Pearl, you OK in there? You didn't kill him. Kill who? My father. What do you mean? He...he hit you real hard, and you fell in through the bathroom door, and you didn't move again, and then he stepped out into the hallway at the top of the stairs, and then he saw me. I startled him. He stepped back, and he fell. When... when they asked me, they asked me if you had shoved him. And I just nodded. I hated you. Everybody did. All I ever knew was that you killed my sister and I was supposed to hate you. I've hated you even more since then. I made myself hate you more and more, and then I just tried not to think about it and I forgot. I forgot you didn't kill him. You didn't kill him. I read in the papers recently about how there was this big miscarriage of justice somewhere. A man had gone to prison for five years before it was all sorted out. He went to court and sued the state. And he got a lot of money. Maybe you could do something like that. I don't need the money. Mike? Fuck you. Mike, it's all right. I told him to. Oh, yeah? Nice touch, Vic. Mike. Dad, what are you doing here? Hello? Mom, it's me. I'm at Josh Hutton's house. Everybody's here. I think you should come over. Dad's really flipping out. Yeah. All right. I'll see you. Bye. Audry. Did you make love to Josh? No! Did you? No. Why not? I just got here. Pearl, what are you doing here? Sleeping. Didn't you sleep here? No, I just came in from the city. That bastard. Dad. That thief, he owes me 500 bucks. Come on, Mike. Where you going, huh? Wait up. Calm down. I go out of my way to convince Vic that Audry is safe around you. And what do you do? You put the moves on Pearl. I wouldn't do that. Don't be an idiot. Come on. Where you going? I gonna go drown myself. What the fuck do you care? What the hell is your problem? Where's my money? I don't have your money anymore. I gave you 500 bucks to get Audry and bring her back. You didn't do it and you kept the money. I didn't even want the money. You didn't hold up your end of the deal. We didn't have any deal. We had an understanding. Ah! You don't understand anything. You can't trust anybody. Where were you? Where were you? I waited for you till 5:00 at the beach house. You said you'd meet me there at 4:00. I--I got hung up. Why didn't you call me? I didn't have a quarter. What's wrong with you, Vic? Nothing's wrong with me. I want my money. Pearl says you're innocent. Innocent of what? He didn't kill Pearl's father. What? Dad, since Josh is not a murderer, all the deals we've made are now null and void. Oh, no. You still got to go to college. I'll go to college when I feel like it. What about all that money I gave that insane charity thing? $11,000. All the money I have in the world, it's yours. I decided I can't have faith in what I can't see. What do you want to see? The world. What about this Whitbread guy? He means nothing to me. How do I know that? You have to trust me. I don't trust anybody. So do you have any money? $12. How about you? Nope. I don't have my tools either. I have your wrench. Oh, good. That'll do. I suppose we're car thieves now. You just gave your father $11,000. But there was no agreement, no deal. Yeah, just money. Hold it. What? Do you hear that? No. What is it? [waves breaking] Listen.
