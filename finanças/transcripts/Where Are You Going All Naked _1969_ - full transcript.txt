You see What harm'll there be Going walking Completely naked just like me? Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! Orestes, the president wants me to go to the office with him. Wake me up 11 tomorrow morning. But it's already tomorrow morning! He phoned, the President, he'll be here in 15 minutes exactly. Damn! They always wake you while you sleep. Goodness, how late it is this morning! Would you translate to my wife? My dear, you are the boss and have the right to arrive late. Hi! - Who are you? - Your wife, dear. But I'm a bachelor. We met last night at that party, have you forgotten? Last night I was in London. Me to, that's where it happened! Your head was spinning, one could say you were drunk. - I'm a teetotaler. - Indeed. I knew it when you fell in the manhole. I called the fire fighters who arrived with their siren. Don't you remember? Remember, they pulled you up with a rope. And then? And then, once out, you asked me if I wanted to marry you. I'm sorry, I drank your coffee. If you show me where the kitchen is, I'll make you another. Don't move! - Why not? - The valet's there. - And the President's on his way. - Who? After I'll explain, now clothes. - Can't you see, I've nothing! - I can see. That's why you've to dress. - But I've no clothes! - Who knows where they've gone! - Where did you put them? - Orestes! Hurry, come here! Have you seen a woman's dress? A woman's what? Don't waste my time! Have you seen any women's clothes? No doing the cleaning I found only this. Maybe it's a souvenir of London. Mind your own business! - And who is this? - Ciccino. A friend gave it to me who works in skins. If it grows up I'll turn it into shoes, or a bag... - Maybe even a suitcase! - What are you doing? - I have a headache. - So you swallowed my beads? - I swallowed two pills. - No, my beads! I put them in that little box when they unthreaded. - Will they harm me? - I don't know. I've never eaten any. Don't move! President, good morning. Are you crazy, Luna? Why did you put the chain on? The chain? Wait just a minute, I'll be right back. I can't find my glasses! You, thingy... What's your name? Tonino. Tonino, I'll return tonight. You mustn't move from here. I wonder why I put the chain on? I forgot. - Have you forgotten that too? - It's not mine, sir. I hope so, and not mine either. You see, Luna, I don't deny you a moderate sex life. Thank you, sir. - But I demand absolute discretion. Fair? - More than fair. I made a pact with you because a man of my position... - cannot permit himself... - A bachelor pad. A refuge to avoid the malicious gossip of the people. - Would you like a cigarette? - Thank you. If every time I privately visit one of my employees... Although of modest abilities and functions... My presence in his apartment cannot arouse suspicion, right? But what a figure I'll make if he uses the refuge as a bachelor pad? Bad, very bad. Right. - Look... - Yes? Have you ever contemplated the possibility that... I could take a wife? Nonsense, you know too well that I need a bachelor. At exactly 11. Come on, get a move on. I don't want you to forget... I said, I don't want you to forget... - What I was saying? - That you didn't want me to forget. - That I didn't want to forget what? - I don't know, you didn't say. Not to forget tonight. Here. - What are you doing, Orestes? - Ah, it's you, Mr. Manfredo! Did you know the lady goes around the house completely naked? You're like that with the windows open and the lights on? There's never anyone out front. - No one? - No! Come. Come with me. Come here. - Look at that bus. See it? - Yes. Look at that guy with the white wig and dogs. He was also watching. A voyeur! Bugger! - You also say rude words? - Voyeur isn't a rude word. Bugger! - Look, Pauline... - Tonino! Tonino, you must tell me one thing. Why go around naked? I don't know, wait while I think. What's wrong with it? Adam and Eve walked around naked. Yes naked, but before they committed mortal sin. Then they were covered. I haven't committed any mortal sins. Everyone has committed a mortal sin. Orestes, the people in the bus, the gentleman with the dogs... My mum and even my dad! I haven't and then it's not nice to talk like that about your parents. With your family's secrets, you should keep quiet. It's not about my family, this is my business. If they see you naked, You'll end up in jail for indecent exposure. It's not nice what you say. Perhaps not, but it's the penal code. And I didn't write it. So, kind or unkind, please cover yourself up! But I'm used to being naked. - I know that. I get it! - Thank goodness! Manfredo! What is it now? The first time we kissed a fire engine passed. - So what? - When I hear the fire siren... I want to be possessed. Oh no, the fire station's right next door! Tonino. Tonino, give me a break. Listen... I work in a bank. A bank, you know? It's important stuff, very serious. For comparison think of the Vatican. It's an environment where certain things are expected. Things like decorum, respectability... And nonsense like this... You have to behave... How can I put it? Proper? Bravo! You've got it! Properly, right! We're agreed. In marriage the hardest are the first 20 years. Then everything works out. I must warn you, the President mustn't know of my aunt. I don't know how you could hide her for long. Orestes! I'm not asking you to hide her for long, but to let me decide... When she can no longer be hidden. You are straining my professional conscience. It's he who is paying my salary. Ah! Will this be enough to appease your professional conscience? For the moment. - Are you cold? - I can't understand... This sudden urge of yours to go to the movies! - Must have been the fire siren. - The fire siren? When I hear it, I must go straight to the cinema. And the station next door! Come on! To work, lads. Let's synchronize the signals. General hazard? Perfect, Bond. Sighting the cops? Excellent! That's enough. Now to open the gate. The switch. Shit! I missed. Damn, there's something not working. The viewfinder must have moved. Shit! Let's give it another go. No doubt about it. Something strange. Stupidly open. - Ready, ma'am? - Yes, dear. Call me boy. Not so loud, boy! Massage has its iron laws. So many precautions! But which bolt can stop Rufus? - Why laugh? - Why shouldn't I... I don't see what's so funny in this scene. You see he grasps her now with savage violence... and rapes her? - Pardon? - He rapes her. Why talk like that? I've been told it is better to say rape OK, you can say make love. Either way there's nothing to laugh about. I'm always happy to see two people making love. Not here: It's a dramatic situation, a farewell! - There is nothing cheerful here. - Why are you so angry? It's not a true story, you know? It's cinema. I just can't argue with you. I can't enjoy this any more, you've managed to upset me. Why, you enjoyed yourself? You said it's not a happy thing. I've had enough, it's best that we leave. Much better. - The loudspeaker, darling. - I saw it. They're following us. Why not stop? They stopped too. Try driving off. - But what do they want? - Why don't you ask him? But, I don't understand, you brought me to the movies. Huh, maybe that was yesterday. I can't get out, dear. Do you want to stay in the car? You want to make peace. I understand. You're right Now that we're married, we should try falling in love. For a husband and wife it's very important... Falling in love. Don't you think? HORN Manfredo. I must be off. Away, away! What's the matter? Why bark? Why so alarmed? Are you on edge? Come on. We will return. Rufus... won't give up. It's nice to kiss like two lovers here in the car. It was a wonderful evening. It's getting late we'd best go in. - As you wish. - And then to bed. Then to bed. Perhaps it's a matter of suspending your hormone treatment. Nonsense! What about my treatment? It collapsed by itself. It'll be full of woodworm. Where's my watch? don't translate, dear. I must have left it at the office. SPEAKING IN FINNISH - Don't catch cold, dear. - Thank you, dear. Bye, dear. Still in bed? Shame on you, damn! Girlfriend? Lover? Whore? - Want to insinuate that's not a woman? - It's... The case interests me, come with me. A mere acquaintance. And you want to spend the night in bed with such an acquaintance with no other developments? Yes Yes Tell me, she wouldn't be by any chance... What? I don't know what I'm supposed to think... In the words of Petronius: As the servant, so is the master. Not Orestes' influence. I wouldn't mind having it off, what d'you think. With the girl. We'll talk calmly. On my return. Now get out. Stop, Antonio. - Miss, is this your dress? - Yes, I think so. Thank you. Where can I undress? At my house tonight, after eight. Huh? The changing room is there. Here. What a mess in here! And there's not even a mirror! Ugh! - Finished the window display? - Yes. - Then draw the curtain. - Right away. Damn, 20: 8! Tonino! - I make this point, and I'll come. - No... Damn, you always win. Manfredo! Oh no, I'm fed up! I'm fed up! I can't take it anymore! What can I do? I can't go out, I can't say bad words... I mustn't play table tennis. What can I do alone? You're really quite weird. I... I... I... I'm the weird one? I'm in deep trouble because of you. This is because I try to convince myself that you could be a real wife! Why are you laughing now? I'm trying cheer myself up, You're always angry with me. Tonino. Tonino, listen. Stop sniveling. I want to tell you something. That evening in London when I married you... I wasn't in full possession of my faculties. I was drunk. - I ended up in the gutter three times. - No, two! I'm going back tomorrow. - Inside the drain? - No, I'm going back to London! I want to see a lawyer, I want to get a divorce. It won't be difficult as you're not a normal wife! Don't cry, Tonino. You'll make things more difficult if you do that. - Right now when we're begining to fall in love. - So what? Let me finish. Try to understand my position. Understand? Stop blubbing and think calmly. - What are you doing? - Rape me. - What? - Rape me. Only a little raping. - Manfredo... Manfredo! - You're crazy! - Don't get mad! - I don't feel like it now! - Just a tiny bit. - It's just not the time! I also wrote to my fiancé. - Who? - To George, my fiancé. And he's answered! - You have a fiancé? - 1 had. Dear Tonino, since you're married I'll consider our engagement over. You married so quickly that you forgot to warn me. I give you my best wishes and am sending you a gift. The portrait that I painted. Here it's been reproduced on thousands of pillows that sell like hot cakes. That's it, hold it. No smile, darling. That's it. Are you the fiancé of Tonino? Yes - I'm the husband. - Poor Tonino! Must be really crazy. - Excuse me... - Please. In profile. Can I ask you a question? I want to know how long it lasted your engagement to my wife. Five years. Mine lasted less, and so I'd like to know a few things. I'm sorry but... My wife... who is she? Come here, take cover. Where shall I take you? To that lamppost over there, thank you. It's not far. You're very kind. Do you do this area? Because I've never met you? Before I was in London. Now I live there, but only for a few days. - And now? - Now I'm going back. I'll come with you, Don't you see how it's raining? - Do as you like if it's no trouble. - no, no trouble! - You're waiting for a taxi? - No. - Oh no? - No! Hello? Taxis, there are none. But if you need, a massage, a manicure... No need to be rude! - Some people! - But then... - But then you're a... - I've never walked the streets I'm a call girl, all because of that bitch of a madam! I was shown the door for 74,000 lira in arrears. How do I work without a phone? Please forward Marissa's calls to No. 503202 c/o Dr. Luna. Thanks. I've prepared the guest room as Madame ordered... But let me say that Mr. Manfredo will not approve. - 1 getit, I'm leaving. - No, no, come here! I'll help you find the 74,000 lira. Now I'll call someone who's always out in front. Must be a bit shy and a bit in love with me. Are you crazy? That's soliciting! - Don't be stuffy. - And if he's a cop? What do you mean? Come on! Even they make love. Hello? Who? Me? I have to go where? Here at my house. Marisa and I need to talk to you. Unique, poetic, unpredictable, exciting! Since she left, London has become so provincial! David, you finish these photos. Now I'll show you something. Here is when she climbed naked to the top of the Tower of London. Here kissing Bertrand Russell during the peace march. And then a few minutes later when the cops took her away. Really crazy, just like Russian roulette. Did you read that clothes represent social hypocrisy. The idea so impressed her that at the first opportunity she takes them off. - It's you, Manfredo? - No. - It is so to speak. - Stop soaking me. Inside, hurry! - Raining and watering the flowers! - What a nice surprise. Bringing a call girl into my house? - Where d'you want the poor thing to go? - An institute for wayward girls. - Send your sister. - He has no sisters. - I don't want to be re-educated, I want to work. - You see? - She wants to work! - Where? Here in my house? - Eh! - We're all crazy! - I'll give you 20,000 lira. - What for? - To pay for a bed. - She needs 74,000. - Let's finish this for good! - But it's for the madam! I'm very tired. 50, 60... 70. One, two, three and four! Now go away! Good night! - I told you, he's a banker. - Bank employee! Quiet, guys. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? - Oh, who are you? - Here I am at home. - Who are you rather? - If it's like that, I apologize. My name is Rufus Conforti... Or better yet just Rufus. I'll remove the disturbance. Come on, guys. Wait! l invited him. It was for Marisa. To provide her with a client. - A client? - Yes, but don't panic. This was the general idea, but there was no consummation. He has no money. Poor thing, he was so tired! Always up and down in front. But that's my bed! I've grasped perfectly well, what kind your husband is. Petty and limited. One who is covetous of his bed and ends up croaking in it. Come my dears, back to the treadmill. Goodbye. The lighter... Then there are the spoons. Hello? No, I've already said. There's no one here called Marisa! How dare you give out my phone number? - It was your wife's idea. - If not how would she manage, poor thing? - Marisa won't accept money if she doesn't work. - Give her a duster. She's not a maid. You can't do a job that's not yours, right? The domestic union would protest. Why not be kind enough to let her solicit? You can have her, once, a quickie. - I'm not jealous. - What do you mean? Please Manfredino. A little raping. - With that one out there? - Yes. - Me? - You! - Be nice. - Tonino! Don't you ever do it in this house? Hello? Marisa's not here, you idiot! Luna, are you crazy? What? What? Who am I? I'm the President, understand? What's this shouting? Mr. President, how are you? Round about nine I'll be at yours, get everything in place. I don't want to see you. I arranged it with a hostess. Green light, is that clear? Clear out! Fine, good, understood. - Tonino? - Yes, dear? Let's go for a walk? Yes - Clothed. - Immediately. Madam, forgive me, Let me say... I have a list of missing objects. 3 Victorian teaspoons, a small bronze attributed to Cellini And a white gold lighter. - Bugger! - Are you saying we've had thieves in the house. - Yeah! - Tonino, then what'll I do? - I've an idea. Orestes, would you do me the favour to let yourself be possessed by Marisa? All paid for, you know? She won't accept money without something in return. It's not about money, you understand... right? - Where are you taking me? - I told you we're going for a spin... And instead will sleep in a motel. I too have my little quirks.. - Why did you turn off the light? - Because it's nicer. It's like being inside a Christmas tree. Manfredo, why did we come here to sleep? This door falls continuously. Listen Manfredo. I thought I heard... the fire siren. Yes. I seemed to hear it too. - You want to go to the movies? - No. I feel like... Like what? The same that you want too. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Love Letters. Well done, President! So my visit was not entirely fruitless. The massage therapists are asked to fasten their seatbelts. Hello? Who do you want? Marisa? There's no Marisa here. Yes, you're wrong. - Orestes! - Yes, Mr. President. - I'll prepare your bath. No need, Orestes. No need. - Orestes! - Bugger! - What happened? - It seems someone left the hose running in the garden. - So what? - The apartment is flooded. It seems that we should repaint the entire facade? - And the President? - A very bad cold. He's waiting upstairs, Mr. Manfredo. - Right now? - Of course. All the fault of the damp! Combined with the girl? Mr. President... That girl is not what you think. - She's a good girl. - But she was in your bed. She was in my bed, but not in bed with me. I mean... She was in my bed because the bed interested her. Nothing else, nothing at all. A little more? The day after tomorrow evening I'll give a dinner at my house, bring her. - To your home? - Luna, think this out. If she's a respectable girl, she can come to my house, right? I would say yes. - If she's a little tart... - No! In that case don't bring her to my house, but the house below. Choose. - The one above. - Where the gathering takes place. It's important you must definitely not say to anyone that you're my wife... Right? If the President starts courting you, try to keep him away. I understand, I'm your wife. You're not my wife, you're not at all my wife! But if I'm not your wife, why do I have to say I'm not? Aah! Why the scream? - What is it? - Ciccino. - Ciccino? - He's grown. The flooding's done him the world of good. Poor little lizard! - Little lizard! Remember well what I told you. This place is full of important people. Good evening! Good evening, Commander. The gentleman who is talking... with the President... is the Minister of Finance. Don't look! I got it, honey. Not honey... Money. It was you who said honey. I couldn't say I understand, money. Lunch is served. - Where are you going? - To get something to eat. No way, alright. You'll sit here with the leaves in front. - Don't move, don't do a thing. - Can I at least breathe? As little as possible. I hope you're having fun, my dear. Yes, yes! You'll see that we'll become friends. Friends of who? Of course. Thank you. - A Finnish recipe for pasta. - There's no accounting for taste. Do you smell a certain exotic paint. Madame believes that the cook has overdone the reindeer cheese. She suggests we move on to the beschamel cake. Thank you. Do you know what is it? Manfredo, I think I know what happened. It's my fault if the pasta was painted. I entered by mistake in their kitchen through the window. There were workers going up and down on the platform. Why look at me like that, Why are they staring at me all wide-eyed? Look! Did I do something, dear? I just wanted to keep the jars, I didn't do it on purpose! - What's going on? - Pretend it's nothing. Excuse me Excellency, I am truly sorry for what happened tonight. I assure you there... Evidently they are people who have nothing to do with... Bugger! Your Excellency, please, believe me! Let me tell you, whatever I do he gets angry, he screams. "Don't do this, don't say that!" But where will he find another wife like me? I should think so! He treats me as if I were... - A little strange? - Yes, strange! - Is that okay? - No, crochet is something else. Look, you have to move your little finger otherwise it gets in the way. Watch: One down and one up. You know, lawyer? At one point I decided to record all this. - What's she doing? - Measuring. She says that when it grows up, it'll makes shoes and a handbag. If I try to drive it out of my bed, she accuses me of mental cruelty. Very feminine. Very feminine, indeed. Yes, feminine. Does your wife go around naked? No. Bring home a call girl, flood the apartment... Say "bugger" to the Minister and wash the back of the valet? Stark naked. The valet of the President, what's more. - Look! - I'm looking. - Hear the music. - The radio from across the street? No, her records, blaring out. Says that in India they do that. I think that's enough. Lawyer, according to you can I count on this divorce? What can I say? I'll try. I'll do what I can. Isn't he fact that I was drunk when I got married enough? I don't think you were that drunk otherwise they wouldn't have married you. I'm sorry, are you hurt? Excuse me. This is the spool from London blown up as you said. Yes? Yes, sir. Yes, sir... yes, sir... Look out! Yes, sir. - What should I do with it, Doctor? - Send it to the TV news. Listen, I'll come straight to the point. I have reason to believe that you have a strong interest in literature. You hear me, right? Surely, my friend, let's say... that for you, writing is the spark, right? For you the post is no imposition. You are a graphomaniac. What do you know about, about certain... love letters? - I never wrote love letters. - Come on! Lines filled with sweet nothings, with filthy phrases. Don't you remember? Are you sure? Are you really sure? Not even as a boy, not even to my wife. Then maybe it's your wife... Will we discover that it's really your wife that... What about my wife? Nothing, nothing! It's clear that there's been a little misunderstanding. Bond! Modesty! We're going. Excuse me. Sometimes you believe that two plus two equals four... And then one realizes you get the same result... by adding three plus one. Regards. Damned beschamel, It makes me grind my teeth. Do you know what is the thing that has irritated most His Excellency? His ulcer? That you have wrapped the girl in L'Osservatore Romano. I couldn't find a left-wing newspaper. Don't be so funny! Thank you. My pleasure. - Where is Dr. Luna? - Outside, the end of the window. She strips in front of my guests, in front of the Minister says says "bugger". - Did she say or not "bugger"? - Yes, she said "bugger". Another unfortunate incident and I'll deprive myself of your collaboration. Remember that your position here is now hanging by a... a thread, right? - And this picture? It's from London, for Dr. Luna. At his home a lady told us to bring it here. The thread snapped. Could I speak to you for a moment? You'll be happy, Tonino! It's normal walking around with your bare bottom. So don't complain if someone gets... certain ideas. I'm not going back to live in the suburbs and live on cappuccinos. No way! How many green lights I've waited for to live in style and the valet, turned upside down! What? It stinks? Everything stinks! You got me stuck in this mess and you'll get me out of it Sure! You'll get me out. Emilio. Emilio! - Leave the bottle. - Doctor... - Leave the bottle! - But you only drink cappuccinos! - What do you care? - I'm sorry. Tonino... I make a promise. I swear that if you go to bed with the President... I swear on my honour that I'll marry you... On my dishonour I'll marry you. I already married you, but if you go to bed with the President... I'll swear I'm in love with you. Emilio! Damn! Where's my car? I had a car. I can't find it anymore. It was just one of... I had a career and can't find it anymore! More! No car and no career. The ultimate novelty from London The pillow of forbidden dreams No more lonely nights with TONY 15,000 lira. With her ass hanging out. But what a fine little girl! Tonino. My darling! - Mr. Manfredo, it's Orestes. - Orestes? -Yes - What are you doing up there? Dusting. I thought it fell into my usual duties. - Nude? - Why not? Authorized by the lady. Your wife was right when she said that the clothes are a sign of... Of hypocrisy. Clothes are a form of social hypocrisy! - See, you knew it too? - Of course I do! I've been told it many times. She's always telling me. Manfredo, clothes are a form of social hypocrisy. Undress, undress! - How do you feel naked? More attractive? - More attractive no... But lighter in a way. Open sesame! Tonino. Tonino! I'm here! - I'm here! - Are you back already? - Sure, I'm back. - But you're on vacation? - Almost definitely. - My pillows, where d'you find them? They sell them everywhere. Thousands of bottoms... how nice! And thousands of heads! Where's the head? Here! - This is attached to the botty of Tonino. - Not like that, Manfredo! And now Tonino whole. All naked! - 5,000 lira each, 15,000 the set! - Did you get my picture? Did you like my picture? Me a lot, but the President... - Did he see it? - You bet he saw it! Have you been drinking? - Only cappuccinos. - Really? Like that night in London, remember? I don't remember anything else! Why don't you ask me again? One more time. - Sure, but what should I ask? - To marry me. - A second time? - Yes, please. - One more time? So I'll ask you, one more time. I thee wed continuously if you go to bed with the President. What? - Sleep with the President. - Manfredo! - I mean in bed with the President! - What are you saying? If you love me, you have to go to bed with the President! Right, Dr. Luna? Right! So the President loves me and allows me to stay here... On the carpet, with the valet and not fire mel Right, Dr. Luna? Right! Manfredo, honey! Darling! - Tonino... - Tell me you were joking. - Tell me! - I can't find myself anymore. Where did you put my future? I had a future, a car... And now I can't find them anymore! They're gone and I can't find them anymore. Why? - Why? - Because you prance around naked. I told you you had to cover up and it's ruined my career. Don't be like that. Please. I don't have a career because the President believes I'm a bachelor... And I'm not a bachelor. And then... Swear you'll go to bed with the President. Alright, 1 will. But now calm down. - Come on, come on. - Swear? - I swear! - SWEAR! Do you speak English? Speak French? Speak Spanish? Speak German? Choose a language. Madame says you can speak German. - She'll understand. - German, certainly. Don't go. German turns out to be the only language in whose domain in short, I don't know a word. You said you wanted to talk with the lady alone. - Are you sure the lady speaks German? - Positive. And where is this security? - I'm having "a little doubt". - What? A little doubt, a "little" doubt. I speak perfect English. The doubt is this. I think you perform more than the function of an attentive valet. That of a no less diligent... How shall I say Entremetier, pander, come on! - And what does that mean? - Pimp. You're a pimp! Deep down there is beauty even in the figure of a pimp. A classic character as you well know. After all they are selfless, albeit for a fee. It works like this... Madame receives letters from a lover and you translate them into Finnish. Confess! Goodbye. Those letters that I will now show are in my hand. What would you say to extort tens of millions from the adulteress? Fifty-fifty. Half each. But those letters are mine! - Mine! Do you understand? - How mine? That is, how yours? They're yours? It's you? - These letters are the only thing I have left of him. - Of her! Let's reason this out. Not her, her, but she is someone who wrote the letters to you. In more direct terms let me say... The letters come from her, or him or even them. But no, he... him! That ingrate Orestes. - We broke up, you know? - Relatively. Orestes is the valet down there, from the floor below. Finally.

Why did you do it? I couldn't have, Manfredo. Not so much for the President, you know, he's not so bad. But... I couldn't bring myself to. I wish I could get you out of the trouble that I caused you... But right now I'm going to fall in love with you. I'm Stupid! The stupid one is me. I'm an idiot. Look. Watch. What are you doing?

Sure, Orestes. - What is it? - I can't find Ciccino. - Are you crazy? - The door was open, must have escaped. Aren't you ashamed of yourself dressed as a jaybird? - Take off your clothes. - But why? Clothes off and call the fire department as I'm flooding the house. Who is it Orestes? Excuse me, I'd like a word with your maid. Sit down, monsieur Rufus. Orestes, call the fire department! A sudden heat wave? - You want to talk with who? - Oh, no! I've just concluded a confusing pronominal dispute with your colleague. Not with God knows who, but with you I must talk. - What the hell is going on here? - Fire? Hello? Good evening, lawyer. No, Dr. Luna has gone. Tell him the little film he sent me is no good.

The Queen Victoria teaspoons are of nickel silver. The cigarette lighter is gold plated. Cellini's bronze is the product of an Abruzzo craftsman. Don't interrupt me! As for you... I say that as a man you're a facsimile and also quite a poor one. The only real thing in this house is this collection of well-known... compromising letters. The price of this collection is set at 100,000 lire. But I'm poor, that one took everything. Not again! Here comes the President. Luna, you're a lunatic! I'll ruin you, destroy you! Mr. President, I don't care because I decided to undress too. I've decided to give you back your refuge... As you call it with your infinite hypocrisy...
