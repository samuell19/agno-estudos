You never know when and why you fall in love with someone. That is what makes love exceptional. This story is about a woman who falls in love with man at the... very first sight and her world now revolves only around him. Ram is coming for me.. From the minute I got to know about this, Every second feels like a million years. My heartbeat has increased. When the person we love is coming in search of us We cannot express that feeling in words Ram... Ram... Ram, get up! Ram... Ambulance... What are you doing with that mobile? I'm trying to search where can we find tender's head. We don't have food to eat and you want an english girl to roam around? Why are our lives so boring? How many years should we stay here in this country? I am fed up. Whatever it is, drinking raw is really difficult. - Hello... - Hey buddy! It's me, Gopi from India - Yeah tell me. - What time is it there? Idiot, you called me to know the time? No buddy! I heard IPhone Max R has released.. Buy me one. Is that enough? or do you need the back case and tempered glass too? Why do you have to waste money on it. I'll buy them here. Idiot! You think money in Australia grows on trees? We keep aside our respect and work under all white and black people here and you want Iphones and Ipads? Shut up and cut the call. Please buddy. Idiot! What is your problem? Can't you just have the beer and enjoy Happiness? Enjoyment? We just use those words in our lives. Frankly speaking no human being on this earth is happy. - Oh god! He is high - Buddy... Whole life flashes before our eyes while we are drunk. I'll ask you something tell me the answer. Did your parents feel happy as soon as you were born? Yeah According to me, we should cry when someone gives birth and laugh when someone dies. Really? Don't say all this nonsense logics. I'm serious. We should cry before coming into this world as we will face all the problems. And feel happy when we are dying so that there will be no troubles. Don't listen to him buddy, he will keep wasting our time. Drink guys. [PHONE RINGING] Are you still sleeping? We were awake till morning, tell me what's the matter. Which record did you break by staying awake till late in the morning? I finished 30 beers in 4 hours and broke my own record. Wow! That's such a great thing. Tell me why did you call for? I have an important meeting in office If you have an important meeting, why did you call me? Let me finish. Yeah, tell me. Someone I know is coming from India today, please go and pick her up You need not call me for that, you can directly book an uber. Hey, she is a girl and new to this place too. She is coming from India all alone, Can't she come to your place from the airport? Don't tell me all these idiotic logics. Look Malayalam master, I have important meetings too.. Is it? What important meetings do you have? Breaking your 40 beers record? Not you, we should scold that J.D for giving you money Not just drinking, I have other works too. Stop it. Whole Sydney knows that you have no work. I will Whatsapp you her picture, Go and pick her up. Okay? You... Hey... - Come let's go to the airport. - Get lost! Hi Hi Amrutha, right? Yeah This is Ram.

Oh god! I finished masters, searching for a job Oh... Then I might need your help What? I mean... Please guide me so that I can follow you Hmmm. Got a warm welcome as soon as I stepped in Australia. When I saw him, there was a fight between my heart and my mind. I heard everyone say "Love at first sight is trash" but no... By the way, What is your relation with Utham? Nothing. We have grown up at one place. Utham, I dropped her at your place Hey, Let's go out for dinner tonight, don't plan anything else. - Okay - Pass the phone to Amrutha Just a minute Hello, brother! Hi Amrutha, how was your journey? I felt I was on earth when I was on the flight. And when I got down, feels like I am flying. It is because of the long journey. Yeah. Why didn't you come to pick me up? Got a lot of work dear. You take rest, we'll talk in the evening. Okay! Your phone...

You were dependant on your parents when you were in India, but doing the same here too? Look at me, I came here much later than you but crossed all of you. And you guys... Yeah that's true. We are atleast dependant on our parents, not like you. Let me tell you something, Did we ever raise any questions on this? We struggle hard to get jobs and people like you take them away from us. We don't say anything that doesn't mean you can talk whatever you want. Get lost! Go! Move... Move. [DOORBELL] - Hey Amrutha! - Hi brother - How are you? - How are you? Sister-in-law Varshini, She is sweet. Brother, I need to make a call to India, I need your phone, give it to me immediately. Give me fast, I need the phone If you need it immediately... You could've asked Ram for his mobile [PHONE RINGING] - Hello! - Hi Siri, how are you? I’m good! What about you? How was the journey? It was good, but I need to tell you something What? You didn't like it there? You want to come back? No, it is not that. I saw a guy today morning, he was so handsome. Who is he? White or Black? Telugu guy Telugu guy in Australia too? Why are you taking it seriously? Nothing. Got bored looking at those faces. It would be good if you marry a white boy. Shut up! By the way, how does he look? He was so hot, he came to pick me up from the airport. Is it? What is his height? And how about his body? I will call you back, you first cut the call. He is here. - Hello... Bye... Bye... Okay bye! [DOORBELL] - Hi... - Hello... - Utham... - Yes, yes... Please come. You guys are still not ready? I am ready! Jyothi is taking time. Your mobile. You want some water? No, thank you! Impressed. - Why? You asked me if I need water. Indian girls and their respect is very nice. I remember hearing this in India and again now. See if she's ready, let's leave Amrutha, tomorrow is your birthday, right? Yeah, I don't even remember! You don't remember your own birthday? I remember everything until I got down the flight, as soon as I got down I forgot lot of things. She must have celebrated it with her family every year, but this time she’s here. So she might have forgot. Yes. Advance Happy Birthday Thank you! Ok then, let's invite everyone tomorrow and celebrate it grandly. Yeah No, I don't like such things please. I anyway have everyone I like around me, that's enough. Atleast wish her dude What is the meaning behind that smile? I don't like birthday's Why? According to me, it is the mistake of our parents that we are here today. No doubt, you were born because of the same reason. Why do you take it in a negative way? Take it in a positive way. We are here to achieve something. He is not able to achieve anything so he feels that way. It is tough to understand my philosophy, leave it. You are getting mad day by day, consult a doctor Okay leave it. Amrutha when are you joining college? I have to join tomorrow. Tomorrow? I have a meeting tomorrow So... She is a girl, how can she go alone, she is new here that too our Indian. No no, stop it! I'll take her. Wow... It looks so good. All these are common here. I am a nature lover, can you take me to some nice places here? I need not leave my work and show you all these. In few days you will get used to it. Sir is mad at me. I shouldn't have said that. Okay! I'll take you whenever I have time. - I thought you are always free... Hello... I didn't mean it that way. Brother told me this. This Malayali guy is here only to spoil my name Sorry. I am really sorry! That was my fault, how can I take it back? I'll do 100 situps on the road? Or should I sit on ice for an hour? If this is not enough, I'll write a letter saying you are not the reason behind my death and jump from top of that building. You smiled? Thank god that means you excused me. "Rain drops falling on me..." "My love for you is eternal..." "I don't know what this feeling is..." "Is this happening because this is my first love..." "Lightning thunders are now enough..." "Listen to this girls feelings..." "My heart wants me to be with you..." "That smile is all enough for me dear... "I came for you with all the love..." "I am giving all myself to you..." Ram... your love, your anger, your happiness, your sad moments, everything should be mine. I don't think you and me are different. I want to be all yours. You are like a drug. I'm getting addicted to you, Are you able to understand that? From when? - What? - I mean exams? Oh exams? From tomorrow - Hi, is everything ok? - Yeah. Surprise… - Wow! It definitely is a surprise Got a glass for you also…. Ofcourse... Enough enough, For you? You are my only high. Ram... This is a really good evening - Is it? - Hmmm. Here with you, like this. It is too good. How is it? - Generally I won’t get high for the first peg. But maybe because you gave me, First peg is getting me high. What is the matter? Nothing. Wanted to spend some time with you like this. - You want a cigarette? - You have one? Yeah... Take it. I have. Ram... My family, friends everybody took good care of me since childhood and I used to be really thinking that is what life is. I was always first in college and then and they were so many guys behind me and I got so many proposals but never liked any. I never spoke to them… But as soon as I came here, I liked you. Travelling with you for these many days made me realise what life is. Destiny is unpredictable. We were born in India but met here in this country. We think of something and life gives us something else. I hope you understand why am I telling you all this. Ram... Ram... Get up! Unnecessarily I got him drunk Hi... Sorry, I got high last night. You were telling me something, I didn't understand. Tell me now Is it? Actually... - I don't remember it. - What? I got drunk and you forgot things? Ya I don't remember. Oh god, he is very near yet so far. Tell me Okay! I'll take leave, I have to go. Hey. Amrutha listen to me. I cannot act. I am not like everyone else. I can only understand love but cannot give it back. "Can I kiss you, leaving all the boundaries behind..." "Will I not pamper you forgetting all the limits..." "I will just stay in your arms..." "I will promise that now I am all yours..." Do you like cigarettes so much? Sometimes... but why is it a problem for you? Why did you ask me to come here? Because the nature is good Yeah it is good - Your lipstick is good too. - Thanks. - I applied it for you - Why? - So that you can spoil it. - Why will I spoil it? Okay, I'll only spoil it Why do you want to ruin it when it is looking good. Okay! You ruin it then Sure? I did it Will anyone spoil lipstick like this? "Every minute in your love I keep flying..." "Next minute I'll be in your arms..." "I will win your love..." "Our hearts have become one..." "Our togetherness will be affectionate..." "I am asking the dreams to become true..." "You are all over me now..." "Just come to me..." "Our love will float all over..." "When we open the doors of love..." "It should be on us just like the rain..." Why is this man on call all the time? What brother? Is it love? Hey, we ourselves don't have food to eat. Do we need all this now? Not us, it is about you. Not today, but I will definitely find a job that suits me. How can you say that? Listen, we all love money, but will it give us back that love? But if you love people they will give it back to us. People don't understand this logic and spoil their lives. Did you find him? No brother. This idiot is not even picking up my calls. I will cut him into pieces once I find him. - Will you throw them to crows and eagles? - No, I will throw them to Kangaroos - I guess Kangaroos doesn't eat meat. You cannot bring that idiot, but you tell me all these nonsense dialogues. Let's go! Ram... I want to do a part-time job.

Come here. - Did Ram come to you? - No brother, it's been many days. Do you have any work with him? I gave that idiot Rs.10K with Rs.10 interest for 10 days. Those are not Indian Rupees, they are Dollars. I am unable to take that money from him. So decided to kill him. Why do you have to kill him for such small thing? Will you give me that money? I don't have money with me now. Take it tomorrow What? I don't understand why are you clearing his debts He was once my friend, brother - Now? - Now, No. Why? I pointed out his mistake and he cut off with me. - What did he do? - What all he's doing is not right Tell me the matter, Otherwise I'll kill you with same knife that I got to kill him. - No, it's ok! - I will do the mistake now I asked him not to be irresponsible, and he didn't like it. It is not his mistake, it is yours. You should not give anybody good suggestions these days. Tell him if you find him or else you come and give my money. Do you get it? Hmm.. Abhi... - Thank you very much Abhi. - Why? He is my friend. Atleast you try to tell him. How many days will he roam like this? Will anyone who has come this far will be like this? If I try telling him anything, he shuts me up. Ask him to join us at work and stop doing all this nonsense He is lucky to have a friend like you. I'll try to speak with him. Thank you once again. Bye! Hi... You came home early today? You have any work? No, nothing! Is anything wrong? Nothing wrong. Ram... Can I ask you something? - Yeah - Who is JD? He is the worst fellow in our Telugu community. He makes cash out of our Telugu people's imcompetence. Waste fellow! When you know he isn't a good man, Why did you borrow money from him? I was in a bad situation so I had to take it. Why are you asking all this? I don't need to know it, Ram But I will feel bad when people around talk about you. Why should I care about all that? I didn't take that money for my needs. My friend in India was in a serious condition so I sent him that money. I'm not saying what you did was wrong, But you give him his money back, Ram Yeah! I will give him. Can we just not discuss about this now? Don't get mad at me. Please listen to me Hmm, what is it? How many days will you be idle? Why don't you start working? Getting a job immediately that suits my interest is not easy Why can't you do something else till you get your favorite job? I can't do any other job. I will only do something I like Why are you so stubborn? It sounds stubborn when I say the truth No Ram, listen to me. There is a job at my work place. If you join there, you can clear your debts in 3 months What the hell. You are helping me with job? I picked you up at the airport recently, suggested you a job and now, you are giving me these suggestions? That too in a restaurant like that? It is not like that, Ram I know what to do and how to take care of things. Stop giving me suggestions. Everyone likes to give suggestions. He is right, it was my mistake. He came here before me, he knows more than me. Ram! Sorry… I will not say anything like this again, I promise. Hey… Sorry. Please please please. Please smile... My baby. Oh God! Ram, what happened? - I cannot do it. My body isn't supporting me This is why I ask you not to smoke. I will stop. But jogging, not cigarettes Okay, sit here. I will finish one more round. - Okay! - Bye. Ram... - Hey... - Hey... How are you? I'm good What's up? - See ya! Take care - Bye! - Come, let's go? - Yeah! For the first time I'm mad at him. Any girl in my place will feel the same. I heard that boys are not genuine like girls. And now I experienced it. Should I ask him? Or wait till he tells me. I can't wait, I will ask him. Hey, Why are you silent? Nothing. I am normal and fine. Ram, Who was that girl? Girl? Which girl? You just now hugged and kissed each other. You forgot already? Oh Sophie? She's my old friend We say Hi or shake hands with friends. Do we hug and kiss them? She said she's in love. With you? With her boyfriend. I know him, So she was telling me the same thing. When she's in love with someone. How can she hug you? All this is common here It might be common for you, but for me it is jealousy. She has a boyfriend Then ask her to hug him and not you Hugging doesn't mean there is something between us You should've asked her to wait and introduce me You want me to introduce her to you, right? Wait! - Sophie... - No Ram - Don't embarass me. Please don't. - You shut up. Hey, she is Amrutha my girlfriend. Oh Hi! Wow, you are so beautiful. Thank you! Oh god!

Cut the call Mad female, look how is she holding my husband-to-be - What happened? - Torture has started friend. Will there be any happy days in love? First tell us the matter She's mad at you for this reason? If she's a girl from this country, she would've encouraged you. Hey, she is an Indian. That too a Telugu girl. They are like that. You face all these problems when you stay together. Live separetely and meet once in a day, you will not face such issues. When you sit together the whole day and talk everything, You become dry and start fighting for small things. Yeah! What he said is almost correct. What should I now? It is a long weekend from tomorrow, we are all going on a long drive. You also join, there will be a gap between you both and everything will be fine. She is already upset with me. If I tell her this now, I don't know how will she react. What is this dude? You are someone who doesn't fear of anything. But you are afraid of a girl now? - Fool… It is not like that. I don't want to hurt her. Don't overact. Look at him, he changed so much. You took so much time to call back? I was waiting for your call You could've called me instead of waiting Okay. Tell me - What? - Sorry Why? Because you did a mistake Oh for that? Should I tell you something else? - What? - Love you! Okay! Where are you? - With friends. - Come soon, I want to see you. Okay! Not like this, I will tell her directly. - I'll meet you tomorrow. Bye! - Bye... Hey… Let's go inside atleast. Someone might see us. It's ok, let them see. You can hug some random girl on road. But you get conscious when you hug me. Lift me up! Why are you crying? What happened? Nothing. I like you so much. I am mad about you. What to do? Why are you mad about me. Be normal and practical! No! I can't. I am like this. It felt bad all this while Please don't fight with me ever again I can't take it. Madam, you were the one who fought So? You will not talk to me unless I do? Don't you love me? I do. But you never gave me a chance to prove it. If you really want to prove it you would've done it I will, I will. Everything will fall into place when time comes. I will not give you that chance. I will be the one who dominates. - Is it? - Yeah Okay wait, let me get some water I'm thirsty Sit... Don't leave me Oh god! She isn't allowing me to move. How should I tell her about tomorrow's outing? Baby... I'm going on a longdrive with friends tomorrow. Will be back in 3 days. What? 3 days outing? Yeah. I couldn't stay back without you for 2 hours. You want to go out for 3 days? It's been so many days since we all friends went out. They asked me and I confirmed. Now, If I don't go they'll feel bad. And you don't care about my feelings?

Her name is Amrutha Is she beautiful? If I see from my eyes, she might not be as beautiful as you. But If I see her with my heart, after my mom I can only see Amrutha. I am not just in love with her. Her love is more pure than mine. Comparing her love with mine is foolishness Wow! She is so lucky - I am lucky. - You guys are made for eachother Ram... Come here! Say sorry to Amrutha for me. Sure. I will Hey... You proved that you are genuine in your love. But is she the same? - What are you talking? - Not me.. But if you listen to what I say, you will... - Hey you... - Ram... Job which you're doing now is recommended by her. She knows that you are useless Amrutha, what he's saying is true? Ram... Listen to me Amrutha, Just tell me if that is true Ram... Hey! Is is true or not? Don't worry about anything, this job is yours. How can you be so confident? It is about the confidence I have in you I know that I will be getting this job one day. No one believed me. Please open the door. Ram! Ram please open the door. Ram! Ram... Ram don't go please. I cannot live without you Enough is enough. You cheated once I don't want this to repeat How is this called cheating Ram? - Why are you taking it in a wrong way? - I will take it however I want. You didn't even wanted to inform me about the job? I know you wouldn’t agree to it. So I didn't tell you I loved you so much. I never thought I will be cheated so easily This is not cheating You played with my emotions, you didn't even give some respect Why are saying that Ram? Am I not your girl? Yeah! Even I felt the same. But you didn't That is the reason you didn't tell me about your job Be yourself, however you want. But don't leave me Ram, please. Stop this nonsense. Go tell your friend that I am resigning this job You are mad at me. Why do you have to resign? Wait Ram, please Not just mad, I hate you! I cannot kill my self respect and stay back. I don't need you nor your fake love. - Hello - Sorry brother. I am not in a position to give you the balance amount. I need some more time. - Why? I lost my job brother I think your girl knows that you will lose your job. She cleared the payment but asked me not to tell you. I couldn't control so told you about it See you. Ram, listen to me Ram please You made a fool out of me everywhere No Ram... Ram please... Ram.. Please! Please Ram. - Hey, why don’t you understand? - Please Ram… Please don't go Ram. Please Ram Get lost! Why are you behind me like a dog I am ok with whatever you say or scold, but please don't go Ram. Ram... Open the door Ram please, don't go Please Ram, open the door. Don't go Ram, please. "Is this called love? Will it give so much pain..." "Should I just cry that you are not here..." "My tears are floating like a river..." "Will I be able to see you in my dreams?" "I am waiting for you to call me..." 'As you are not coming back, I feel lost..." "There is no life without you..." "Who said there is no love, I am standing here today" "like a bird with no wings..." "Should I just tell you my feelings behind my silence..." "I will be standing on a curved road all alone..." "Do you know that these are written with tears in my eyes..." "This pain in my heart is hurting me so much..." "Should I shout that I am nothing without you in my life..." "I am alone just like a star with no light..." Did you find Ram? I thought you would ask me Why am I here as soon as you wake up Where is Ram? Do you know what is your condition? You've been lying here since 2 days without food. It is good that we came here on time. Where is Ram? Are you mad? He is not here, nobody knows where he is. - Everyone is searching for him. - Where did he go? - When can he come back? - Amrutha… If you're love is true he will come back If you stop eating like this you will die before he is here. You know what is more painful than death? Loving someone wholeheartedly Amrutha, think before you do something. We all know how much you love Ram. He might have done that because he was angry. [Phone Ringing] Amrutha, Ram is at Shepherd court. Ram, why did you do this Ram? Why did you leave me? You know I cannot live without you Leave me! Please Ram. I know it is my fault Please forgive me I will not repeat this ever again baby. Please! I cannot stay without you I cannot live without you, I can't... Amrutha, leave me. It doesn't look good Let them see, I don't care Why are you behaving like a Psycho? I will really become mad if you leave me Ram. Be however you want. I will not question again. You need not work also. I will take care of everything Don’t do anything, just be with me. That's enough You mean that I'm still a useless man, right? I didn't say that, Ram. You will look after me? - I didn't mean it in that way - Then, why did you say that? I said that because I love you Yeah that same love made me stand on this road. There is no freedom, You must like all that I do. You change everything as per your wish. Understanding each other feelings is what love is You shouldn't force people into anything I've been observing ever since we met each other. You keep poking into everything and call it love. I cannot do this anymore. Please leave me Hey... Ram, please don't say that. I will not repeat this Ram I'll stay however you want I will whatever you want me to do I will prove that my love is true Please give me one last time, Ram Will you really prove it? - Yeah, I will Then don't show me your face again. And then I will trust your love. Just leave! Is this your final decision? Yes. What happened? Where are you going Amrutha? I am going back to India Why? What happened? - Will you really prove your love? - Yeah, I will Then don't show me your face again. Just leave. Amrutha, you going India in this condition is not good I cannot stay here brother. If I stay back I cannot stop myself from meeting Ram. I cannot face all that Will you spoil your life for that? A person should never take a decision when they are angry, sad or happy. As you both have been together for so many days, He might have got irritated a bit but love will be the same If you want to win his love You should first lose. Stay away from Ram for few days Things will settle. Trust me Amrutha, time heals everything What is this buddy? why are you doing this? What did I do? Don't ask me that. How many days will you stay away from everyone? I think I'll be peaceful staying away from people for few days You mean, you were not peaceful all these days? I didn't mean it that way We all know how much she loves you, Why are you not understanding that If you are here only to talk about Amrutha, please leave What? You want me to leave? Before I leave, I'll talk everything clearly. First tell me something? What is Amrutha's mistake? Mistake? It is a very small word. She cheated on me Cheating? Loving you so much is cheating? Thinking about you always is called cheating? Leaving everything behind for you is called cheating? She wanted to live with you, die with you, Is all this cheating? She cared for you more than your parents If she really cared about me so much, Why didn't she inform me about the job She clearly knows you would never agree to it. If this is called cheating Then what you are doing with her now is called betrayal. Is this called betrayal? Is that called betrayal, then? You got that job because you attended the interview Because of your talent and not because she recommended. Okay, let us keep that aside. She made a fool out of me by paying back to JD. Isn't that a mistake? Are they any great people for you to become a fool? She gave money back to JD and asked him not to irritate you anymore. She didn't make a fool out of you, but instead saved your dignity . And coming to that Abhay, we both know about his character Since the day Amrutha came here, She only had you in her priority list. It is your luck that you have her in your life. Girls are horrible these days, and you've got her in your life Please stop it! You are just talking about Amrutha continuously, Not just her even I loved her wholeheartedly. My love is genuine too. Then why can't you forgive her? She wanted her love to win so she did this mistake, why can't you forgive and move on? Why should I compromise? Why can't she do it? - She was doing the same till now. Whatever the situation is, She was the one who always compromised. Sorry, I am really sorry. It was my mistake. Sorry sorry, I am sorry. It was my mistake. Please forgive me. If you want the relation to be strong, You should also know to forgive people. Amrutha is a girl who only knows to give love. The day you understand this you will go back to her. This is not my philosophy, it is Nature's philosophy. It is your wish now. "You made my imagination come true with your love..." "Our souls have become one..." "Everything was so good when I was with you" "I'm the one who left you, it is my mistake..." "Not having you in my life is giving me pain, and I'm unable to bear it..." "It is all you everywhere when I close or open my eyes..." "My world is empty without you..." "I've realised there is no life without you..." Utham... Where is Amrutha, I want to see her Harrison Street, Landsdale, Melbourne. [PHONE RINGING] - Hello... - Hello Amrutha... Hi brother, How are you? I'm fine, but guess what Ram is coming for you... Yeah Amrutha! He has totally changed. - What? He wants to see you, He is coming in search of you I told you know, time heals everything Amrutha. Thank you Brother... Ambulance... Yes, yes sir. His condition is critical. The major complication and death may be imminent He has got multiple fractures in his body, Mainly his heart is damaged. It's called Cardiac Tamponade. His heartbeat count will be decreased to 20 times per minute from 70-80. It is very tough for him to survive. Maximum 24 hours. Talk to the Indian Embassy, Finish the formalities and Plan how to take the body to India. We are helpless, Sorry! Where is Amrutha? I'm talking to you, where is Amrutha? She is not here Where did she go? She has gone to India I know she will not leave me in this condition and go. Tell me where she is. Tell me the truth. I'm not lying! I can see it in your eyes Utham. What you're saying is lie. How many days can I hide the truth, You must know it someday or the other. What truth? Where is Amrutha? Hello brother. Doctor, this is a developed country, Well developed science with advanced medical treatment. Can't we treat a person who is still alive with all these equipments? There is one small chance. But I don't think it'll work. We can replace his heart with someone who is brain dead. or someone who met with an unexpected accident. There is a chance for him to live if we replace his heart with them. But we don't have a chance now As it should be done in the next 24 hours. Finding a heart with the same blood group immediately is impossible. So, you better take him home. Doctor, can I see him? Sure Ram... This doctor is talking all nonsense He says your heartbeat isn't normal But your heart will be fine and I know it Love can solve any problem in this world If your heartbeat stops, my love will have no meaning You will be fine, Ram You will be fine. I always thought love is all about you being how I like and me being how you like But I understood it isn't like that Love is all about being happy together I thought pure love is only about giving life, but no, It is about loving someone truly I still remember how my heart raced when I first saw you It is love at first heart for me Love is two words and mad is two words I love you madly, and I can end my life for you People kill themselves and make their love win You've given me place in your heart but today if that heart stops beating, How will my heart work? The minute your heart stops beating, mine will stop too So, I've decided to become your heart I feel lucky for doing this, as no girlfriend will ever get this opportunity in her life. Not just happiness but sacrifices are also a part of love I've decided to do this to prove that God can't tear us apart Hello Hello. Royal City Hospital Yes! I got an information that you guys are looking for heart transplantation Yeah! Someone just met with an accident at Mantrait Caston way Can you please send an ambulance as soon as possible Sure Thank you! People generally fear death, but I am loving it today It's time for me to end my life and save my love "You left me proving that love never ends..." "This merciless death took you away from me..." Ram, please don't cry! If you cry, you know that I'll feel bad. We are not two different people, we are one now. I will be with you in every aspect of your life No one can ever take me away from you I am your heartbeat every second now Your problems, your happiness everything has become mine This is something no girl can ever experience Lovers can never come into this world together or leave together But for us, we both got a second chance, We will live together, die together I've made you all mine from today You gave me a chance to prove my love You made me a part of you and gave my life a better meaning I love you so much Ram... "Did the earth just crack open..." "Did the cruel life steal you from me..." "Did the compassionate Gods forget me..." "My love, won't you return..." "I feel empty without you..." "No matter how long, I would still wait for you."
