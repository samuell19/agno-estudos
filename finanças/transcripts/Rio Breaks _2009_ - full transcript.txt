-|s there a hole in the boat? -No. Some water does get in. That's normal. It's to cool things off a bit. It won't sink. It won't. This here isn't the Titanic. There are breaking waves here too. On this sandbank. -But you've never caught 'em. -I have. -Here? -I caught a big swe|| at Posto 6. -It was three feet high. -Posto 6 is one thing, this is another. Hey, Rogerio, how'd you |eam to fish and drive a boat, stuff like that? I learned ittrom my dad. When I was eight years old, I started coming to the sea and we fished there on the islands. We'd go to sea at three in the morning spend the night at sea... and sometimes, if the weather was bad, cold, we'd fish for anchovies. But it's cool, dude, to live with nature. You live well. You don't make much but you live well. You make good friends out here. Also, it seems that fishermen last longer, dude. They live longer. -Just like surfers, dude. -For sure. | wish there weren't so many people in the water. It's really bad, we worry that we might hurt someone, send them to the hospital, and then you worry if they're dead. I imagine l'm dropping into the biggest wave in the world. As I drop in, | make it out without dying. People who come to Arpoador have less money, people from Cantagalo, Pavao, Pavaozinho. Because of the different social background, there's this spot here... where we hang out, the poorer people. But in general, us surfers, we're all friends, we all chat, no problem. | feel at home here. If I could bring my bed, my stove, l'd move in. The beach is the world to me. My name is Picachu and I'm a surfer. I catch waves at Arpoador. | live at Morro do Cantagalo. I wanna be a pro surfer. | party all night and then surf all day. In the morning, I head straight to the beach. If there are waves? You'll find me on the beach. I'll be right here. I think we all run the beach in equal parts, both the concrete and the favela. My house isthat way. It's there. There's a big staircase. See that line up there? Fabio lives at Pavao, he just started surfing... and he does it well, likes it... and we'll see how things work out in the future. My favorite surfer is Kelly Slater. He rocks, he surfs a lot. He'sthe best surfer in the world, wins all world titles. To me, Marcelo totally rules Arpoador. He's incredible, surfs so much and hates it when people snake him. Sucks when people snake you. You're on the wave and then there's some dude snaking you... really sucks. Fabio had a few issues in the past with his dad. Due to his young age, I'm not sure if he really knows... what's going on at the moment. The beach is where us, Rio locals, come to have fun. Even people from the outskirts of town travel three or four hours by bus, train or subway to get to the beach. It's the only truly democratic and free place we have in Rio. At least once a week people play hookey to come enjoy the sunshine. When we talk about the hill, we're talking about a poor community. When we talk about the hill, we're talking about drug trafficking. When we talk about the hill, we're talking about prejudice. When we talk about the hill... fear. There was a shootout with the police at Cantagalo. There was a raid and two friends of mine died. It sucks. I know because that's how my brother died. l was here at the beach and I could hear everything. I lost a friend, he was involved. Let his guard down. l was at home. He got shot right here. I had two brothers who got involved in the drug trade and, asl often say in loud and clear Portuguese, I've made bad choices in life. I've been shot several times, been shot on the head, leg and stomach. I had a son who was a surfer, but he got killed. I can't even talk about it. I miss my dad a lot. I pray for him every night when | go to sleep. The guys killed him. His own gang killed him. Just because he wanted out. He wanted to leave the gang and the guys wouldn'tlet him. So they went there and killed him. My mom's worst fear was that I'd join the drug traffic... because I had many friends who had joined and met theirfate, so she worried about that. But thank God I discovered surfing and here I am. I started surfing when my dad brought me down to Jean's surf school. l was four years old. I hadn't surfed for a while and said, "Jean! Your name isJean, right?" "Can I borrow a surfboard so I can hang out here with you guys?" There's gonna be a contest at Arpoador and one at Barra. And it's gonna be very exciting for the kids. We want to show this generation that they can also... have a chance to compete in the future. It's better to be on the beach surfing all day... than to be in thefavela with a gun in your hand. I've only taken part in a bodyboarding event. I hope I can compete when the next junior contest comes around. I've been surfing a lot, going to all these different beaches, Arpoador, Prainha, Barra. Catching the best waves to improve my surfing. I've also entered a few contests. I haven't won anything, but at least I'm taking part, right? The waves were good, but it was really cold. Two penguins swam by and asked for a coat! I'm gonna keep on practicing until the contest. On contest day it will be all or nothing. You either win or you lose. When I have a board, | lend it to everyone. I really don't mind. There's not much of a system. | just leave my board at the beach. Most of these boards here belong to my clients. And there's also Picachu's board right here in the back. For people from the community, I fix boards for free. | only charge people from the concrete. People will usually pick up the boards at the bottom of the hill. They don't come up here. l've invited them to come join me at church today: Fabio, Naama. Many of my surf buddies have been here. -|t's the first time I come here. -First time for me too. Never seen anything like this before. It's like this: A wave is God carrying you in his hand. I've lost many surfer friends already. Some became drug lords, others died in armed robberies, some are in prison. I'm gonna pray for a betterfuture, for us to surf tomorrow. We wanna ask God for tomorrow to be a better day, for us to surf. It's difficult because of the lack of money, no one has sponsorship. Everybody just surfs because they love it. It's their life, their lifestyle. Many friends have lost their way so of course we worry about their future. But we're gonna do everything we can to keep them surfing. Vietnam, check out the name. The place is way sinister. You gotta see it to believe it. The view is amazing. It's awesome. You see all of Copacabana, even Leme. But it's super heavy up there. They call it Vietnam because there's a lot of shootouts... when the police go up. Today we went over to my house and to Fabio's house. You guys got really tired. The cameraman even threw up! Can anyone go up there? Everyone can, except for the police. Because they're different factions. The police are one and they're another. The Red Command doesn't like the police. The police are against both of them and they are both against the police. If the Blues come to this hill there will be a shootout. If the Reds go to the Blues' hill, there's gonna be a shootout, and if the police raid either one of them, there's gonna be a shootout. I hate it, all these shootouts, bunch of idiots. Bullet this way, bullet that way. It's crazy. As people say, we're children of the hill. Ever since we were born, we've always lived here, then my dad died, my mom left and we stayed here with my grandpa. We raise them here, in this situation, as you can see. Everyone is crammed on top of each other. He runs away to the beach every morning. We think he's at home, but he's out in the water. This is the living room, in here is my uncle's bedroom, this isthe other room. Here's another room, over here's the bathroom. I sleep up here, my sister and my brother-in-law underneath with my niece. Over here is the couch, where we sit down. I don't have a surfboard. I borrow my friends' boards. | surf with J ean's... or with Bogerio's. Fabio and | go to the beach together. Every morning we head down to Arpoador to surf. Fabio's been out of school for a year. He doesn't really like school. lthinkthat's bad. He needs to study to make something out of his life. This is my older sister, Brisa, for "sea breeze". This is Canan, who teaches at the dance school. -This is my niece. -A|itt|e brat. She's a brat. This is my mom, Janete, and this is my Dad. Dad, I'm going back down to the beach. Don't you have soccer practice? You can't miss it. You can't drop all other sports. My dad talks to me a lot. He tells me every day... "Naama, don't do drugs, don't do this or that. "When you go to the beach in the morning, "don't take the roads where there could be shootouts." -And is it safe for us up there? -You're afraid, aren't you? They know already. They know it. The drug lord... I think he knows as well. So it's okay for now. But if you guys screw up... you're dead. Or they'll chop your arm off. Something like that. They'll throw the body down into the pit. The pit is off a big cliff. They throw trash in there and bodies too. At the soccer field there's a place where they burn bodies. The other day we were playing soccer and I went to get the ball. I saw a finger. I got the hell out of there. I met Fabio at Posto 6. It wasn't even at Arpoador. Bight, Fabio? We gotta be friends in the water. If an outsider comes and tries to pick a fight with us, we don't let it happen. No one messes with our friends. What's the difference between a surferfrom the hill... and a surfer from the concrete? In the water, at an event or just surfing, there's no difference. But once you step on the sand, of course, one gets into his car... and the other goes on foot back up the hill. When we mention "favela" people are amazed at how polite we are. But it's because they've had the chance to meet us and talk to us. They find it okay to speak to us and they realize... we're normal people just like them. We have dreams, desires, needs. We're normal much like them. If you put us all together, we're all normal, we're all the same. Picachu is entering the contest. It will be his first contest, his first dream. It's important for them, it's a learning experience. They learn the difference between just surfing and competing. -Are you gonna compete as a junior? -Yeah. l'm competing as a junior as well. The only bad thing about losing... is hearing people say, "Dude, you lost!" When I surf | feel like I'm in a dream. I think about dropping into the biggest wave in the world, making money, getting my mom out of the hill, me, my dad, my whole family. Going where there's no guns, no criminals, only the police to protect you, and waves as well. When I'm 16, 17 years old, I'd like to go to... Dang... not Hawaii... -Help me out! -Australia. Yeah. I wanna go to Australia. Catch lots of waves there. I don't really like living there. There are too many shootings... and you are risking your life. I'd love to be able to leave. I'd like to live in a building. Any building, even a crappy building, but at least I'd be able to leave. We were playing, I started to tickle him and he got serious. Then he said he didn't want to play with me anymore... and all of a sudden he started to slap me in the face. I hit him right back and told him, "Don't talk to me anymore!" Then he kicked me and I started to cry. Fabio is always like that. We argue and argue and when I finally want to speak... to him again he goes, "Now you wanna speak to me?" Then, when he comes to speak to me | tell him to piss off. Same thing he did to me. Every day is the same. If you don't go to school you can't take surf lessons. First you gotta go to school. Go to school and we're gonna help you get a surfboard, but you gotta go to school. I went back to school. I walked into the classroom and went, "No way!" Freaked me out. "It can't be Fabio!" I went there, put my backpack down and sat right next to him. From up there you can see if the waves are good or not, from my school window. Today I checked and saw some waves so I came down to the beach. Fabio is surfing well. I think there are some guys better than him but he could still finish third. l'm rooting for him to win, get a better life. Fabio is totally crazy, he goes out no matter how big it is. He almost drowned out there. And now he's doing it again. Trying to die again. You only get one life. You can't play around with it. Rain. Most of the time the waves get bigger when it's cloudy. But if it doesn't rain, that's even better. Rain means summer's over in Rio de Janeiro. In about five days a cold front will be heading in. It's gonna bring big waves, over two, three meters. It's gonna be good for surfing. You just stay at home. It's cold and raining. You can't even go to the beach. I'd rather not stay at home. People here like to pick fights with me. I'd rather go to the beach, straight to the beach. When it rains, I shut the windows. Yeah, it's raining. It's getting wet in here, it's a little wet. This is my friend, my Belgian canary. | always feel like letting it go because nobody likes being locked up, but if I let him go someone else will catch it. So I'm gonna leave it there. The beach is everything for him. If you don't lethim go to the beach he gets mad. He won't even take a shower after going to the beach. | tell him he'll turn into a fish one day. We can tell by the way he positions himself on the board. When he paddles in, he jumps right up, bends his knee, the style, looking down the line, he knows. He's got Simao Bomao's style. Bochecha was one of the best surfers from Arpoador and from Brazil. He got really good sponsorship. Won the junior Brazilian championship. Picachu isjust like him. | practically taught him to surf, he'd surf with my surfboards. Back when l was competing, he was just starting out. His main influences were guys from my generation, me, Rogerio, Thyola. l was actually surprised when he chose the wrong path. And he got lost, got shot. Now he walks kind of crooked. He almost lost a leg. He could have become a great surfer, one more example. He could be here at my side now, giving this same interview. It's very easy for a kid to get lost, because at thirteen... he's not gonna make 200 bucks a week. It's really difficult because that's what they get offered. They don't force them to do it, butthe kids find an easier way... and end up going for it, and then, at 15, 16, they're dead, a life lost. Remember when you said I shouldn't do my hair like Nem's? Sol had onlythetop died. I do know Fabio's life story, his dad, his mom. This kid has been through a lot. You've been to his house. You saw how itis, right? His dad died, his mom practically abandoned them. His mom lives on the streets, she's been in jail. He basically lives on the beach, rarely goes to school. Sometimes he doesn't even have breakfast and goes straight to the street. So many of my friends who entered the world of drugs and crime have died. On my way to the beach I'd see them lying on the ground and cry. "There's my friend, dead on the floor." I saw that and realized that's not what I wanted for my life. That's how I chose surfing. l was smart, managed to travel and win events, and it worked for me. Biggest swell here, the best, was in 97. We had three-meter waves, really clean. That went down in history, everyone remembers it, 1997. I don't dream about big waves, only about normal waves. I dream more about competing. Only recently I started to dream about riding big waves. I don't want to catch big waves, but I wantto go to Hawaii... just to see what the waves are like there. I wanna see if those guys can really ride waves that big... because I don't really buy that. -You've never surfed big waves, Naama. -Of course I have. I wanna surf really big waves. For me, big waves are easier than little ones. I'm already making history here in Arpoador. Joyce, the little girl who catches big waves. The waves that Carlos Burle rides are as tall as this building. -You're lying. How tall is it? -Twenty meters. Bullshit. -So how tall is it then? -Let's ask the doorman. How tall is this building? How many meters? How many? That building's only two-meters tall. I'm not afraid. But I also have a little secret. When I'm catching big wavesl don't even look back. | just paddle forward. Surfing doesn't mean we are tough. If that were the case... Fabio would be a pro if that were the case. You almost made me pass out just now! Good surfer? Good bully, that's what he is! On the beach, he gets on everyone's nerve. Like the devil! I'm just fooling around. I like to dish it out. It's good. Only way they'll learn. Dude, get five bucks and I'll take you up the hill to get a haircut. They'll shave here, here and on top! Harderthan steel. Let me touch it. Ouch, it pricked me! That's not funny, you clowns! Easy, dude. Easy, man. He's like a porcupine! You made a hole in my hand! Sometimes I like goofing off, sometimes I'm upbeat. Sometimes I'm quiet. When there's no one to play with | stay quiet. I'm not getting up now. You're gonna smell like pee. -Why? -Because I peed. -Where'd you pee? -Here. -No, you didn't. -|t stinks. lt stinks like pee! -Grandma, isthere milktoday? -No. Leave the boy alone. Let the boy do it himself. If my grandpa gives me money, I'm gonna buy bread. I check the surf from that dude's roof. lthinkthere'll be some small waves today. Maybe we can catch a few. Naama wants to beat me up! You gotta respect me, I'm your uncle. My mom is not like those girls outthere. Come here! You can't play with knives. Stop! Stop! Come here! Leave me alone! -Knives are not for children. -So... Stop! Stop! I'll tell my mom! -Are you gonna shut up or what? -Yes. lam so hungry. I'd love to eat that delicious bread from the bakery. Why don't you go buy it? Give me the money and I'll go. You talk too much. Nobody asked you. -Who said I had any money? -l have ears. -|'m talking to the vultures. -But the vultures aren't listening. But I'm talking to them. -Who needs help with schoolwork? -Do I ever ask you for help? -Yesterday you did. -Did I ask you? "Naama, what isthis? How do I do this? I don't get it..." "Do it for me, Naam a. Do it for me." -Did I ask you to do it for me? -No, no. -Who gets beat up all the time? -You beatme up. But I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about who studies the most. I'm not into talking, fighting is what's up. That's all you know how to do. -Fighting is what's up. -That's why nobody likes you. I didn't ask anyone to like me. I worry a lot about him. He's a difficult person to deal with... but with tact you can talk to him in a way he understands. I'm very impressed about how much he changed after he started surfing again. The board is much biggerthan him. I can't even understand how he does it. I want him to continue. It's the only way he won't follow in my dad's footsteps. The project had been abandoned so now they've transferred it to my name. l'm organizing everything. There was an event but I didn't go because I had no money for the bus. I didn't even bother to ask my mom, it sucks... l have one at school, one on the hill and another one down here. This beach has no waves and no hot women. Check it out. Each day I meet a different one. Girlfriends... you gotta collect them. If you have doubles, you swap them... Just like baseball cards, if you have two of the same you just swap them. Where did you buy your bikini? -Was it a gift? -Yes. Is this something you give a woman? A Brazilian dental floss bikini? You can't do that, it's against the law! So this girl walks over, and the two just started to argue. "Naama is hot, l've dated him." Then the girl who was just with me said, "You did not!" They slapped each other, pulled each other's hair and | just cracked up. They're in the same church choir. Women are like gum, once they stick on you, it's hard to get it off! On the hill, you get a girl you always gotta have more. And it's easy to get lost. A friend of mine wasjust killed. He was 15. Just a few days ago. His name was Juju. The police came up the hill, he had a gun, they exchanged fire... and the police killed him. I heard the shots, then I saw his girlfriend and her sister run by. He was still breathing. When he got shot he didn't feel anything and just started to run. We find out about these things every day at my house. If one person knows, the whole hill knows. From Pavao it goes to Cantagalo, and it just spreads. This is Fia's house. This is Thyola, the famous Thyola! This is Picachu's house. This is Fia. Her food's really tasty! I like it here because I've made so many friends, I don't wanna lose them. Get the hell out of the way, Picachu! Dammit, Picachu! I'm just gonna buy a house here and go surfing. Can you picture us falling from here? This house is about 4 meters tall. They sometimes fire theirguns nearmy house. We don't go to school when there are shootouts. Then, when it stops we go. My father? He was involved in trafficking. Then there was a big war here, between the Red Command and the Third Command. He died during that war. Are you afraid that Fabio might follow in his dad 's footsteps? Yes, I'm really afraid he might join. We're always giving him advice, my uncle, me, my grandpa, so he doesn't follow my dad's footsteps. He cries a lot when we talk to him about my dad. He misses him a lot. My father was a very happy person. He loved the beach, liked going out with us. He was a very good person. When he died, me, Fabio and Pi were very sad. We were, how can I say it... Especially Fabio, he changed a lot. He became rebellious, pushy, started ignoring people, doing a bunch of wrong stuff. l was happy. I was really happy when my dad was around. -l was eight years old. -Why did they kill him? He wanted out and the guys wouldn'tlet him. The next day they killed him. - Where did it happen ? -Just up there in the pit. He used to catch waves with his friends from the hill too. The guy who lives in the building there, my uncle... Arilson... lots of people used to catch waves with him. Do you think about him When you're out surﬁng? No. Only when I'm home, when | go to sleep. Then I dream about him. Fabio's been going to school but he's been skipping too many classes. His friends have already told him he's gonna get expelled. So we're keeping an eye on him. I would love to be in these contests, maybe even go abroad to compete. But I haven't got any money. Must be about 50 bucks to enter. 50 bucks is not easy to get. Surfing is great, but not better than many otherthings. Not betterthan what? It's better to ride in a helicopter and go parachuting. -Then you can have an accident. -You can have an accident anytime. You can walk over there and have an accident. But a surfing accident is not the same as a glider or parachuting accident. -But I like it. -You can die. You can die from anything. -Have you been on a helicopter? -No, but I want to. I like it. -You like it, but you've never done it? -So what? That's why I love it, because I've never done it. He's crazy. If you'd been on one I could understand it, but you haven't. That's exactly why I like it. I don't know what it's like and that's why I like it. -And how are you going to ride one? -Man, you're so dumb! You're the dumb one! Hey, knock it off! You're hurting me! Knock it off! Making people eat sand! His godfatheris athug. Check this out, he picked a thug as a godfather. If he keeps it up, when he gets older, he's not gonna have the friendship... of some of the people he really wanted to be friends with. Because he could become someone if he's nice, but if he keeps treating people like that, wanting to hit people, he could head in the wrong direction. Then he can't be a surfer, which is what he wants. This cop was walking by and he joked with Fabio, "Dude, your hair is looking like a skunk." I didn't like it one bit, so I said, "Anyone asked you?" Fabio says, " Who asked you ?" and then the cop started cussing at him and asked, " You nuts?" -Then, What did he say? -He told me to take it up my ass. -Does Fabio need to be careful? -Very careful. I think he could turn to dealing or start stealing. He'll die young or go to prison, one of the two. The way he's disobedient, already lost his dad, his real mom doesn't care much about him. So I don't know, he's a little... unloved. Naama and Fabio have gotten a lot better over these last few weeks. If they keep it up, pretty soon they'll be competing. They just keep getting better. Naama too. Picachu is the evolution of surfing. So we're gonna be here together, trying to get better at it, and I hope some day we can win a lot of contests. There's a little barbeque here today. A "fight" barbeque. Everything's cool, except for the fight between Fabio and Maicon. I don't wanna talk. They started arguing and then suddenly Fabio was swearing at Maicon. I don't wanna talk. Maicon hit him, slapped him, that's all. I wasn't attacking him, no way! It was a little squeeze, just a pinch. And then Fabio got upset and started to cry. Now he's on his own. Let him be. But I'm not the enemy, l'm afriend. If he talks to me I'll talk. I don't wanna talk. I don't think this is a violent place. If you're violent to people, they'll be violent back. You can't run around in the apartments down there. You have to keep everything just right, not here. Here you can fly kites, play soccer, marbles. Not down there. At Pavao there's only two seasons: kites or marbles. When marbles season ends, kites are back, and when kites are over, marbles season begins. The surfing season can never end and will never end. Where's my kite? Cut the line! See that, Naama? Fabio couldn't get into class because he's been suspended. He thought the teacher was just messing with him, but I knew she was not. Everyone was goofing off and she asked, "Who wants to get suspended?" Fabio thought she was kidding and said, "Me." So she suspended him. -Today is the day! -Today is the day! Don't cry, today's the day! Run to the water! -Hey, you haven't been christened yet! -Ask Jean! Don't worry! I'm gonna get you! This was the boy's christening. It's natural. Everyone's been through it. They've all been christened. All of them. I'm the one who's been christened the most! -Are you gonna help Naama? -Yeah, right! He didn't help me. Get him! Get him! My leg! Slap his ass! Here they are, the two christened of the day! Look who started this today. Look who got this all started. Fabio is a bit crazy. I don't know, sometimes he goes crazy. Like a dizzy cockroach running around trying to find something to do. Come tell them they took your clothes off too. They took mine and Fabio's clothes off, we were left naked. At least they didn't swing me like this, with my bare ass out. They even slapped your little ass. They slapped your ass too and sent you out to the water. -Little tiger towel... -|'m gonna hit you. -No, no. Look here. -Say it. Say it. You're gonna copy me? Yeah? -|'|| throw a rock at you. -|'|| throw one back. My bad, Picachu. Grab your hand? No, l'll fall. Try grabbing me and I'll show you! You'll see. Three popsicles for two reals. Let's cool down these hot days! The ice cream man is coming near you. Come and get it! The ice cream man is coming near you. Come and get it! Five scoops in a cup in many flavors for one real! I don't stay in the hill much. I hang out at the beach with Thyola, Rogerio and Pretao. I wouldn't be surfing right now if it weren't for them. l was a little kid in this picture, at Arpoador. -l was young, better looking than you are. -And there? -Thyo|a. And this one? -That's Joyce. She was tiny. -Is this your dad? -That was my dad. In this picture here, we were coming back from fishing. This is the one we're always talking about, Bochecha. Doing an off the top at Diabo beach. He was a kid your age, probably around 13. Where's he now? He doesn't live here anymore. He catches waves like I do, with his tongue like this. You surf with yourtongue like that and hunched. Gotta stand up straight. You have to train a lot to win those contests. The trophies are there. Look at all my trophies. Soon we'll be com peting for those trophies there. I'm pretty close to doing my first aerial. I've done one. I'm gonna teach you to do an aerial right. Right... Don'tl already know more than you do? More than me? Then we should have a competition, the two of us. Why don't you create a little contest and give those trophies away? The trophies are mine. I can't give them to you. Let's see who wins! Now we're gonna make a bet. We're gonna see who surfs the best. I'm going to bet my trophies and you're going to bet six months... of work for me and you're going to learn some good manners! -Do we have a deal? -Yeah. l have to practice a lot. Surfing, training every day, competing. I need to win to get sponsored. Compete and win. Not com pete and lose. A contest for these kids is everything. If they do well, the desire to surf, that drive will only increase. Winning a surf contest, for someone who surfs, or for any other sport, is very important. It will last you forever. The medal or trophy you take home stays with you forever. This is my brother. lliked him a lot. He was really good to me. -He died, the police killed him. - Why did they kill him? He was into trafficking, but that day he wasn't even armed. He was carrying a box of laundry detergent and a DVD. He wasn't armed, didn't have any drugs on him. They threw him down the stairs. After they shot him, they threw him down that huge staircase. They hit him, then they took him to the hospital. It wasn't even the police who took him, I think it was my mom. -Why was he trafficking? -He wanted to give my mom money. My mom didn't have any money, neither did he. So he had no other option. Do you think about it, that you might follow in his footsteps? Not me. Even if I can't do one thing, I'll try something else. I'll keep trying everyday. I'm going to try and get a job, do everything right, earn a salary. Not risk my life and die. I hit the board with my teeth, started to bleed. It really hurt. Rogerio is going to crush Fabio tomorrow. l'm cheering for Rogerio. He's gonna win. My bet's on Rogerio. I heard that he'll be... He'll sanding surfboards for Rogerio for six months. And if Fabio wins, Rogerio will give him all his trophies. I don't know why he chose the trophies instead of choosing a board. He didn't win the trophies in the first place, why would he want them? He's gonna tell people, "Look at all the trophies I've won." And when he gets older, I'm gonna say, "It's a lie." "He won them from Rogerio. It was pure luck." I'll be cheering for my dad for sure. Fabio likes to challenge everybody! He's gotta learn to be a good loser. He surfs like the hunchback of Notre Dame. -Did you ever help your dad? -No. Did he want you to help him? No. Are you afraid that you might join? Yes. What do you feel? What do you think? Lots of bad things. -Are you afraid of anything? -Yes. What are you afraid of? Of dying. Today's the day I'm gonna beat that kid, Fabio. We have some good waves, good conditions. So today is the day we set for this competition between the two of us, man on man... I mean, man on child! It's gonna be a piece of cake, for sure! He has those moments when he's super nice, really cool kid, but then, all of a sudden, he totally changes. Hey, dude, don't touch me! He thinks he's better than everyone, but that's good in a way. And that's what competition is. If you want to compete, you gotta have that spirit. You gotta believe you're better than your opponent. Fabio only has one good wave. Rogerio has three good waves and a high score. You're gonna have to wash my underwear! It was a tough com petition, but Rogerio with his great talent... was the ultimate champion! He won the contest with three excellent waves. Now that Rogerio's won, Fabio's gonna eat some dust! He's gonna have to sand boards for six months for him... and I'm gonna laugh so much! Today at the beach, you were supposed to score higher than Rogerio... and then you could've beaten him. But you did good. Today I really ripped... and you said I only did three off the tops. Well, lthought so. I only saw you do three... I did several! Not even. I wanna drive one. Fabio, driving here would be really cool, huh? Yeah, man... Because the water's so smooth, the thing wouldn't even bounce! Fabio, what animal would you like to be? If you were an animal? -|'d like to be a hawk. -Me too. I'd be a hawk, or a lion. You can go anywhere... It'll take a while but you can. Fly real fast. Look, from here to Rocinha it would take you two minutes. You can take shortcuts. Cars have to go through roads, a hawk can cut through buildings. Cars have to turn on streets, wait for the traffic lights. Not a hawk, a hawk can just step on it. The gang has a pact All together at their hideout We are going off to war We 're all bandits Each one carrying their own gun lnvading the enemy Ready for war They shot everyone They exploded Fabio Detonated the bunker Killed ﬁve cops The ﬁrst was Fabio The second was Lucas The third was Dudu The fourth was Marcao The ﬁfth -Was Naama -The ﬁfth was Fabio The gang has no mercy Threw him in the trash can high as hell This is the Red Command Mess With us and we Will kill you This is the Red Command When you guys were first here I didn't feel I was ready to compete. But now I'm definitely ready to compete. I'm gonna practice. I do wanna compete, but I'm not sure I'll get to. Today the waves here are okay. They're good over that way, that's why they chose to hold the contest there. Today l have a feeling I'm gonna win. They're gonna face a lot of obstacles, but I always tell them not to give up. Put something in your head and go after it, fight for it. Nothing's easy, gotta go after it, fight hard, eventually things will happen. It's gonna be very exciting for the kids. You get a bit nervous at first, get an adrenalin rush with the first heat, butthen later you loosen up. But the best feeling is when they call out your name, "Picachu, in the black shirt, Naama, Fabio, in the blue shirt", and they get all nervous, excited. Are you going out? Are you gonna compete? Are you a junior? Me too! Anderson Picachu! In yellow.. Still in 4th place right now, Fabio da Costa. In yellow, closer to Pontao... Attention, countdown. Five, four, three, two, one... | forgot, man. I didn't hear my name. | forgot. I didn't hear the announcer! | forgot. When I paddled out... I had only 2min30sec left. - What does he do all day nor/W -Who knows? He sleeps. He spends all night out on the streets and then goes to sleep. Are you sad he's not coming With you to the beach? Me? No. - What do you make of it? -Nothing. ljustcome to the beach on my own. It's better to surf alone than with bad company.
