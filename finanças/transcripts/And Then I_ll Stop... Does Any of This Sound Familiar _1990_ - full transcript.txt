Okay, let's just talk and let me see if I can hear you. Hello, hello, hello. Okay. Well it's working. How do you know it's working? - Oh you can hear it through there? - Yeah I can hear it. - Okay. When I was 12 and a half I started smoking pot. Mm, tell me about that. Okay - that's where it all really started? beginning. It was in school. I'm in general accounting at this moment; I manage our general accounting department. I have been with this particular company for going on ten years now, and my first seven years I had been manager of the cost accounting department. I was in the army. I maintained all the equipment for chemical warfare. I had a job in the food service industry, and there was a lot of alcohol around. Well, I was a lab technician. We worked for an ink room at a printing company. I worked the night shift. Doing what kind of work? Loading and unloading tractor-trailers and stocking shelves. I'd lay lines out on coffee cans... Lay lines out on shelves. Smoke pot with the other guys in the back rooms. Sneak outside and smoke pot. We'd always snort crank - anywheres. I can remember sticking a straw in a bag, snorting right out of the bag. I can remember going over friends' houses before I went to work and getting off. I can remember... ?snorting and driving down the street, you know. Any way I could get it into my... I can remember eating it, rolling it up in tissues and swallowing it, drinking it... Any way I could get it into my body - putting it in my liquid. Any way I could get it into my body, I'd get it in. I would say it was over the next few months that I was doing pills... Ludes, and speed, and THC. And smoking pot was like an everyday thing. I always was high on pot. Especially if there was nothing else around. I sort of had a year-round program of alcohol drinking, on a Friday night. Which'd be like the only thing I'd make sure of. I'd make it a point to leave early, I would hit the bar. We'd go to the seashore Friday nights. I would usually stay sober enough to at least get us down there... But once I was down there it was throughout that entire evening and usually until the wee hours of the morning we would be drinking and then Saturday would be shot. Because I wouldn't be getting up until 2, 3 o'clock sometimes in the afternoon. And then I'd feel so bad, I'd get right back into drinking again. I'd usually hit the local tavern - Sunday... Yeah, it would work right into Sunday. A lot of times we wouldn't even come home Sunday evening, because I felt so bad. We'd have to get up between 4, 4:30 on Monday morning to just drive up here. And as long as I kept moving and got in the shower, I could make it to work. But it would usually take 3 to 4 beers. And if we had any liquor in the house I'd have a couple shots before I even made it to go over to work. I missed several Mondays, but it wasn't to the point where the company was saying that, "you have a problem." I got high at work because my boss got high. I had a chronic cough, generally poor health, you know. I got sick very easily. You know, sick days because I didn't feel like going in that day. It definitely made me lethargic. And I would do things several times, not realizing that I'd already done it. And I just had a really poor outlook on life at that point. When we first got together she would go get me beer. And once I got a full time job, which was a pretty decent job, as a machinist... she would make sure that other people knew what kind of beer I liked. And, I mean, you know, great, you know! At the same time, if I would come home really drunk... she would say "Geez, you're drinking too much." You know, I felt like I had to hide it from her, because she was getting more and more upset about it. I changed it into, in my mind, to a thing where, well since it upset her, I would hide it. Hiding booze and drinking in secret became a part of life. So definitely it changed our relationship. I can't say it went unnoticed, but nobody sat me down and said "this has to get straightened out." Because I was able to function and get things done. It didn't bother me to stay after hours. I knew as long as it was starting at the beginning of the week, I had the middle towards the end and the end of the week to finish anything that I wouldn't get done. Nobody noticed it for a long time... They saw me putting in a lot of the overtime. Now of course what that was doing that was hurting my home life, because I was never home, obviously. Excuse me, sorry. My choice in friends switched from a pretty sociable, nice crowd, to the schleps in school. Then - forget it - my clothes! I didn't care what I looked like when I went to school, I was wearing drug paraphernalia as jewelry, you know. I was walking around in such a stupor. And what happened once... I started not remembering things. And, I decided, oh God, I could really get into trouble. I don't know if I'm pregnant, I don't know if there's people out looking for me. I better, like, start leaving a diary! I was real scared! Scary, to the degree that I was an active alcoholic for 10 years, and no one ever said anything to me about my drinking. Except I had one boss who encouraged it. Right next to the plant there were gin mills there, that were... They were virtually open all day, in all. I think they had like 2 hours off, or something. So you could really just about drink in there all day and all night, which at... at times I did. And a number of times I would, you know, pass out at the wheel and wake up when my tires hit the gravel and things like that, you know. I didn't think quitting was a possibility. I thought switching drugs was a possibility. For instance, I'd get real sick on cocaine, lose a lot of weight... and then I'd just switch. I'd think, well it was the cocaine that was doing it. So I went on to heroin, and heroin did the same thing. And I thought, well, it was just the heroin. It was never an option to stop. One time I did get caught by one of the night bosses, with the rest of the crew, smoking some pot. But he just like walked in the room we were in and said "What the hell's going on?", turned around and walked out of the room. He didn't reprimand us or turn us in or nothing like that. But I can't remember ever being approached by any of the management. Like I said, the only one who ever tried to really help me, was my father. I just automatically assumed I was going to be told that I was getting fired or something; I always had that paranoia. And it got worse and worse. Because I knew I was in... heavy in my addiction. And to go out and find another job would have just been overwhelming to me. I couldn't even comprehend even coming up with a resume. You can't write a resume and a letter if you don't have any self-esteem or any self-confidence left. Because it'll show in the letter. My drinking went out of control. Prior to the year-end... about 3 months off fiscal year-end, where I'd gone down to a bar... a local bar one day after work. And from that night on I don't remember very much for the next literally 2 months. So the diary entries started in the mid-spring and through the summer, and my mom found it. And deep inside I kind... there was a piece of me that was relieved; because I knew that I had sunk and hit bottom. I was real scared. You feel like there's no way out unless you have someone to blame. I didn't have the strength to stop on my own. But now I can say 'Oh, my mom's making me go to a rehab', 'my parents are making me stop'. Even though deep inside I was feeling like I wanted to. I'd go in the bathrooms and shoot up, and think, you know, nobody knew. I'd have a Coke can full of rum, you know, and I'd think nobody knew. And everybody knew. Everyone else was laughing at me. I thought I had the last laugh. Towards the end of this whole entire two month blackout period it was getting to the point where physically I could barely walk anymore. Because I had not been eating... all I had been doing was drinking, and I was totally confused. I was paranoid every time I heard an ambulance siren... that it was definitely coming to me. I was keeping my shades down, I would bury myself in the bed under the covers the entire day. It was just insane. I knew I needed help. I didn't know where to go to get it, or what to do, to be honest with you, you know? All I knew was that I wanted to get high one more time. And then I'd stop tomorrow. And that was the way it was through a lot of my addiction. One more time, and I'll stop tomorrow. And every time tomorrow came I got high again the next day. It was really hard to ask for help. I'd say that I won't do it tonight, or I'll stop drinking for a week, or for 3 days, and invariably I would talk myself into s'... to one day equalling 3 somehow, or you know, well, I did it for a day, and, you know, well I can do it for a week, knowing full well that I hadn't even really done it for 24 hours, meaning more like 15 hours since I'd had a drink. And it becomes a problem when the drug and the alcohol is more important than your friends, your family, your school, your values... anything that you care for. When drugs and alcohol come first in your life... and all that other stuff doesn't matter anymore, then you're in trouble. I knew that I had pushed her a couple of times. If I think back about it, I threw things at her. Beer bottles and other things, calculated to miss just slightly. But when you're drunk your calculations can be off. I got up and I got out of bed, and I was walking around on broken glass on the floor. And all the pictures and picture frames were off the floor and broken. And I thought, maybe I hurt or killed somebody, because she's not here and neither are the kids. And it scared me. So that was it, that was like the end for me. Of course, my girlfriend had been involved. She saw me drinking constantly at home and I'm supposed to be sick. She had called my boss - I thought she was against me, that this was finally her way of bringing the entire problem out in the open. And having me fired. This was definitely the end, and I said I can be out of work for a while. It's not going to matter... I've got plenty of savings. I didn't think about all the other important things, like your insurance, and your medical benefits, and your pension and everything else, and friends; all the friendships I had created at work. I was willing to throw all that away. I had even gotten to the point where I had wrote a resignation letter. And I was all ready to mail it off until my girlfriend got a hold of it and took it from me. I was like, really feeling sick... and one day I just found this pamphlet that was sent out through the union. The drugs were just... the crank, speed was just driving me... and the drugs I was doing was just driving me nuts. And I called this phone number on the pamphlet. And they made an appointment with me for me to come in to see a social worker. The personnel department puts you in contact with the EAP. And everything was strictly confidential there, you know. It just made it so much easier knowing that I would still have my job when I came back. I still didn't know if my family was okay. And I thought well, that's it... You know, I've tried it my way, and maybe there is some help. So what I did was I went to the phone book, I looked it up, I called. A person told me about a meeting the next night. I got in the car that night, and I went over and... And, uh, I sat in the parking lot wondering whether I was going to go in or not. And I fought with myself for that for a while. And I finally did go in. When I first went in, I didn't know anything about the structure of AA, or anything else. I expected to see a bunch of dirty old men in raincoats complaining about not being able to drink. And I get in the meeting and there were all these people who were nicely dressed, who were articulate, and it felt good right away... talking about your problems and all that kind of thing. I never talked about any of my problems to anyone before. The treatment center provided a counselor to come out. And along with my boss... I never saw this man before. I recognized everyone else. I didn't like him because he was a stranger. By the time the screaming and yelling was over with, they had finally left my bedroom because I ordered them out. I didn't want to let them save my life. Something took over the next day. I decided I needed the help. I called my boss. And my girlfriend took me to the treatment center that evening. Anyhow, I called my sister and she made some phone calls, and she called a preacher, and this preacher got me into treatment. I was in detox for 8 days. My stay in the treatment center had all been a part of my benefit package. It made me feel unbelievably good inside that people understood that I had done something that a lot of people wouldn't have done. I can't compare sobriety, recovery, whatever you want to call it, to any of the days of my addiction. I don't have as good a recovery an' sobrie... or sobriety as some people I've met, but it feels good! When I started on this film, by listening to the tapes you have just heard, I realized how serious my own problem with alcohol had become. I'd been making everyone around me miserable for so many years, and it seemed that the only feeling I was able to experience and express was anger. So I began to realize how I had been labeling myself, all this time, a functioning alcoholic. And at the same time I couldn't even manage to get my film off the ground. So somehow I just knew I had hit bottom. I knew that it's time to quit drinking. And since I came to this decision by myself, I thought I could quit by myself. And I went to a place where I knew I'd be left alone, and it never occurred to me how dangerous something like that could be. After I experienced some pretty frightening things, I realized how badly I needed help. And I managed to find a doctor who had enough experience with alcoholics, and he steered me towards a group of people who understood exactly what I was going through. And today, with their help and support, I've discovered that I never really lost what it takes to be sober. Feelings once buried by chemicals began re-emerging... I began to remember what it was like to pump a bike up a hill, and feel that sensation of fun at the same time, even when it got tough. And that's the kind of joy that had been missing from my life for so long, and that I kept thinking I would never experience again. So - it feels good to be sober. And only now do I understand why no one should, or has to... ...go through this alone.
