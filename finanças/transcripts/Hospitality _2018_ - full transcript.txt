Subtitles by explosiveskull Good afternoon, Donna. I only had one customer come by this week. He didn't even spend the night, just... I swear to God, whoever taught you manners. We're gonna hit the rewind button, start this one over. Okay? Good afternoon, Donna. Good afternoon, Zane. How are we doing today? Just fine, and yourself? Oh, I'm all right. My mother's back in the hospital again. The emphysema's getting ugly. But other than that, uh, I can't complain. Anyhow, I'd love to stay and chat but I'm afraid I got me a whole laundry list of things to do today. Let me guess, you had one customer this week? That's right. And he had a nap? - And a meal? - Yeah. - You charge him by the hour? - Uh huh. How many hours? Three? Okay, so plus a meal, that's $60. 20% of 60 is... Oh, I got two bucks inside. You're getting good at this. I remember when you used to take awhile to do the math. You know what, you keep it. No, no, no, I got it inside... No, no, no, no, no, I insist. Okay. Hey, you, uh, you didn't happen to offer anything extra, did you? Considering I haven't done that in close to 20 years I'll let you figure out the answer. I'm just checking. Gotta check, okay?

Both rooms were booked up. Someone was in the kitchen having a meal, people were stopping in. It was like the Super 8. Man, I'm tellin' ya. What's a Super 8? Oh, it's just a fancy hotel.

No, I didn't get married. Why not? 'Cause I, I didn't feel for him that way. Nor did he for me. You know, when you get married, you gotta really love someone.

No, I think my ship has sailed. But you will. You'll get married. Yeah, I'm, I'm gonna marry you. Oh, that's sweet, honey. But you can't marry me. Why? 'Cause I'm your mother.

That I'm not him. Oh, hardly. Oh, good. Good, name's Cam. Cameron Lewis, everybody calls me Cam. Hi, Cam, Donna, nice to meet you. You plan on spending the night? Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. Uh, but first thing's first, I'd love a wash and a shave and some food, too, if you don't mind. Yeah, of course, it's what we're here for. Sorry, you don't. You don't remember me, do ya? Should I? Oh, no, no, suppose, I suppose not. I remember you, though, I stayed here a long time ago. I'm sure I looked different then but you don't. You don't look a day older, ma'am. And uh, you showed me a good time, a real good time, you know, it was memorable for me, but maybe not for you, so. Uh, sure, yeah, I remember you. Um, it's nice to see you again, Cam. Uh, I'm afraid that things have changed in the years since you've been here. I have a son now and this here is where we live so we're still a fully operational bread and breakfast but that's all we are, you understand? Yes, I think I do. Okay. So if that's not what you're lookin' for, I just can't help you. Well, no, like I said, I just uh, I'd love a bar of soap and a razor if you got one and something warm to eat. Yeah, that we can most certainly do. - Come on in. - Thank you. All right. So what brings you back around after all this time? Well, the truth is, I never really left. Been an inmate over at Four Corners Prison. The plan is to take a bus back home see my brother and his now wife. I haven't seen them in close to 20 years. You were in prison that whole time? Yes, ma'am. What for? Well, only one thing can get you put in prison for that long and it ain't something I enjoy talking about, but, this being your house and all. You got every right to ask me anything you want. I don't need to know the details. Good. Just know that, uh, I'm what they call rehabilitated. Studied the Bible every night in there and I don't mean to bring any trouble or disrespect to this home or anyone or anything until my time is up on this earth. That's about all I do know. I appreciate that. Hope you're not put off. No. No, I've done things I'm not proud of. I mean, people don't understand it's all a matter of circumstance. The less fortunate you are, the more desperate you are, the greater chance you got at screwing up. I believe most people have a good heart. Just life has this way of squeezing out that little bit of bad and then well, that's all people can see. Do you read the Bible? Book of Matthew? No, I'm not one for religion or readin'. Seems like you live by it, read it or not. There's this part in there about, uh, judging others. I can see you don't do that. Guess not. Can I take your plate? Yes, ma'am. It was delicious. Did you sleep okay? Yes, ma'am. Been sleeping on a cardboard box all this time. Felt every damn bedspring for close to 20 years, you don't know how well I slept. I'm living in luxury. So this place, um, change at all? Coulda sworn it was different. It's been so long. Oh yeah. Well, for one, there was no Jimmy's room. That was my bedroom. So I had two rooms for rent. My room now, plus the one you're in. Yeah, yeah, I think I stayed in your room. That makes sense. Yeah, it's all coming back to me. So you plan on heading out today? Well, you know, I thought I was. Maybe another night would do me good. My brother's just gonna put me on his couch or on the floor, he don't have much in the way of accommodations, so maybe I treat myself to another night. If you're not already booked. Oh no, there's no reservations here. Great! Well, I'll go get my wallet. Oh, no, no, you stay put, that's all right. You can give it to me later. Good morning, pumpkin. Come say hi to our guest. - Hi. - Howdy. Name's Cam, Cameron Lewis. Everybody calls me Cam. I was just telling your mom what a great place you got here. I make all of the beds and I do all of the grocery shopping so everyone can eat that comes in. Oh, those are two very important jobs. I guess I should thank you for my delicious breakfast. You want some orange juice, honey? Yes, please. - Spiderman, snack time. - Here you go. He make a good pet, that rabbit? - Yes. - Yeah, I suppose. Bang! Whoa! This a stickup? No. No? What then? It's broke. Ah. Broke, let me see it. I got it at the store awhile ago but they don't make it anymore. Oh yeah? Oh, there you go. Just jammed, is all. Let's see. Yeah. It should work now. Be careful, these BBs hurt, don't go shooting people with it. Well, what do I shoot then? Cans? You never shot cans? You wanna? Why don't you go ask your mom if you can shoot some cans with me? All right? I'll wait here. Mom, can I go outside and shoot cans with Mr. Cam? Uh, what, you're gonna shoot cans? I'm gonna shoot cans with the BB. All right, if Cam wants to. She said yes. There we go. All right. - Can I try it now? - Yeah. Yeah. Now, what you wanna do, you wanna close one eye, and keep your dominant eye open, okay? What? Your better eye, which one's your better eye? Doesn't matter, doesn't matter, just one eye, okay? Line up the front sight onto the target, okay? There you go, keep it level. Now, think about that gun as an extension of your arm, okay? Now, I don't want you to pull, I want you to squeeze that trigger. Yeah! There you go! - I did it. - Kid's a natural! Same with the real thing, you just get a little bit of kick back and it's a bit loader, but... Oh, it's all right, I know him. Afternoon. Good afternoon, Zane. Howdy. Shooting some BBs. Oh, shucks, I thought I'd get me some excitement for once. Sorry to get your hopes up. Name's Cam, Cameron Lewis. Ah, Zane. I'm the sheriff here. Also an old friend of Donna's. How's the bed and breakfast treatin' ya? Very well. Very well, thank you. Well, if you're gonna stay awhile I can recommend a couple of spots if you feel like getting out. Oh, no, no, thanks, I'm just passing by. I figured that was the case, yes. That's what everyone does 'cause it's just that kinda town. Reckon I was passing by, too. I stopped a little longer than I thought and next thing I knew I was the damn sheriff. Pretty sweet deal to me. Yeah, its okay. It's okay. So from where to where? Sorry? Just passing by, where you coming from, where you going? Jimmy, stop! You do not point that at people. Only at cans, okay? - I wasn't gonna shoot it. - I don't care! That is the rule, otherwise I take it away. Yeah, I did try to tell him if that makes any difference. It's all right. Donna, let's talk a minute. Excuse us. Handsome. I suppose. You really have to suppose? I'm a man and even I can see that. Sure, he's handsome. Do I gotta start wearing a rubber? Oh, don't be vulgar. You have every right, but I have just as much right, I ain't going where someone else has been. Jesus, Zane. I am not fucking him, I told you I don't do that no more, he's a customer. How many nights? One so far. - Meals? - Yeah. Okay, go get it, I'll wait. He hasn't paid me yet. He has... Well, why the hell not? Just, I just haven't had the time. You always get the money up front. Now he's already spent the damn night and ate your damn food. What are you gonna do when he says he don't have the money? - He's not gonna say... - What would you do? You'd come crying to me, that's what you'd do. It's like I have to stay on top of you for every damn thing. Running a simple business, you can't even do that right. Rule number fucking one. Look, I will go inside and I'll get the money. Come back tomorrow and I'll pay you. I don't wanna be here tomorrow, I got stuff to do tomorrow. All right, then come back another day. No, I'll come tomorrow. It was nice meetin' ya! What do you say we switch to something a little stronger? On the house, of course. That'd be nice. Yeah, what do you like? I'm afraid I don't have a full bar. Well, it don't matter, you pour it, I'll drink it. All right. Cheers. God. What. I haven't had one of these in a long time. Not used to it. Prolly got the tolerance of a high school girl. Well as long as I don't have to hold your hair back. Smoke? No thanks, I don't smoke. Quit in prison. Wow. That's an odd place to quit. Tell me about it. Like currency in there, kinda gives you a leg up. If that makes sense. Yeah, it does. Yeah, I couldn't do it. Oh. I wanna thank you for what you did today. Oh, no, it's nothing. No, really. You know, he don't have a man around and sometimes I forget how important that is. What it does to be able to do guy stuff. And he was really happy. Then I had to go ruin it and yell at him. Oh, you didn't do nothing wrong, you were just being safe. Yeah, I know. Sometimes I forget that he just don't know better. You know? I just wanna shake the hell outta him. But then I know he means well. He's just so good and simple. You're doing your best. I can tell you from someone who had a bad mom. But you ain't that. Not by a long shot. Thank you. Can I ask you something? When you came by here, were you looking for a lay? Hey, I guess so. - But I didn't... - I mean, did you think about me? And the time we spent together while you were in prison? Yes, ma'am, I did. And was it good that I can't remember? Was I good? Well, without much basis for comparison I can tell you.

Well then why does it, sounds like you're angry or something. I'm not. I am just processin'. Look, I had no idea who the father was and now that I might I'm just lettin' it sink in. That's all.

There's some people here I'd rather not bump into. I thought you said you were what they called rehabilitated. I am, they're not. That's the problem. Morning, Jimmy. - Good morning. - Morning, Jimmy. Hi. Hey, thank you. So are you gonna stay another night? Afraid not, kid. Hey, Jimmy, why don't you go outside and get some air? But I just came in. So why don't you take Spiderman outside and get him some fresh air? Okay. Okay, but don't leave him outta your sight. Come on, Spiderman, I think they don't want us inside right now. Hey listen, I don't mean to be rude or offend you or nothing, but Jimmy, what's, what's his malfunction? You know, I only ask 'cause if I am the father... It'd have nothing to do with you regardless. I gave birth to him here, and during the birth something got all mixed around and the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. That scar he got, you noticed that, right? Yeah. He wasn't breathing for awhile and I finally got it off him and I think it did something to his head 'cause he's never been quite right. Spiderman! Spiderman! Spiderman! Spiderman! There you are. Hey there. Hi. Hospitality. I could use some of that. You work here? Yes, I make the beds and I do all of the grocery shopping so everybody can eat. Well, you wanna see me inside? Sure. My mom's in there right now, though, with a customer. His name is Cam. But he's leaving today. Oh he is, is he? Mama, we got another customer. Oh. Hello. Hi, Joe. But you can call me The Boss. Uh, boss of what? Uh, it's a nickname that stuck. You yell Joe and I barely even turn around anymore. Fair enough. I'm Donna, I believe you've met my son Jimmy. Yep. And this here is... Cam. Good to meet ya. Oh, likewise, sure. Oh, the boy there, uh, what'd you say his name was? Jimmy. Jimmy, yeah. Jimmy said that, uh, there might be space for me here. Uh yeah, yeah. You're leaving, right? Well, you know, on second thought maybe, uh, maybe I'll spend another night. All right. Could you excuse us, just a second? Um, do you wanna bring your stuff upstairs into my room? - Yeah. - All right. That's wonderful. No, you got a knack for cookin' darling. You really, you do. Oh thank you. You're not hungry? I strongly recommend it. I'm okay, thank you. You got a nice place here. It's home. Oh, it's nice. You ever think about putting in new flooring? No. Oh, you should keep it in mind. People don't realize what floors do for a place. You put in a new flooring and suddenly it's like a new house again. You agree, Cam? Oh, I never gave it much thought. I'm sure most people don't. I'm in flooring so it's how my mind works. You know, I walk into a house, first thing I notice is the floors. Now, laminate flooring, it's easy, it's cheap, you can put it right down on whatever you got right now. If you don't mind being about an inch taller. You pull the base shoe, the baseboards, you can put it right down on this kitchen floor. Of course you gotta remember to wipe up spills quick. That's important, see, 'cause it's susceptible to moisture damage. You get that right away or it'll mold. So. Well, I um, I should get to bed. Long day of traveling ahead of me. Oh, of course. Um, it should be all made up for you, and if you need anything, anything at all. Oh, I doubt it. Hey, what's the matter with you? Huh? Oh, hey, I'm just tired. Not too tired, I hope. Hey. You sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm just, I don't know, I'm just, um, you think maybe we could call it a night? Yeah, no prob. Goodnight. I'm sorry. How'd you find me? What's the first thing a man wants after 20 years of abstinence? Don't gotta be Sherlock Holmes to figure that out. She ain't a whore. Oh? Coulda fooled me. Anyways, I was gonna call you. - Sure. - It was the first thing I was going to do when I left here. Sure, in a week or two Thursdays. I shoulda known. Shoulda waited instead of traveling all this way. I won't tolerate any trouble in my home. If that's what you two are here for, I think you should leave. Oh, no trouble. Cam, is there gonna be any trouble? I don't think so. See? Uh uh. Something's going on here, I don't even wanna know what it is. I think you should leave right now. - Okay. - Sit down. Look, let's take it outside, okay? I'm not sure where you're headed but there's a bus that could take us right through... Sit down. We got a lotta catching up to do, me and him. So how about you wrestle something up. I got the appetite for a midnight snack. I'll warm up the leftovers, it's all I got. I'll take 'em cold. I need that money. I don't have it. You know, I was only gonna take half, my half, but, if you keep lying to me I'm gonna have to take it all. I ain't lying. I don't know where it is. You said that you hid it and you was gonna go get it when you got out. Now, you've been a free man for how many days? You expect me to think that wasn't the first thing you did? It was. It ain't there anymore. 20 years is a long time. Things change. And I buried that money in the woods and now in that very spot is a parking lot. A parking lot? Yeah. So either some construction worker ain't working construction no more, or me and you, we gotta go rent a jackhammer and find out. But either way, sitting here talking in this woman's house, it ain't gonna do us any good. A parking lot. Yeah. I couldn't believe it myself. What time is it? Baby, go back to bed. But I heard everyone talking. Yeah, we're talking. Please go up to your room and shut the door. We're all headed to bed soon. You know, I ain't good at much aside from flooring which just about anybody can do. I'll admit, I was usually the one wearing the dunce cap at school. It's not that I'm not smart, it's that I'm a different kind of smart. Now, now the way I'm smart is I have a bullshit detector. It's probably better than anyone's bullshit detector in the whole world. And right now I'm tellin' ya, alarm bells are ringin'. 'Cause there's so much bullshit in this room that I feel like somebody's rubbed it into my mustache. I'll tell ya what I think. I'll tell you what I think and you tell me if I'm wrong. I think that you two are smitten with each other. I noticed it as soon as I walked into this house. You're shacking up, hitting the hay. You have fallen for one another and now you're gonna make off with all my money. Now, if I don't have the best bullshit detector in the whole world, tell me. I hate to break it to ya. What money? What money? She's better than you. I still smell bullshit, but you're the better actor. What money? You got a cigarette? It's not one of those mini things, is it? Thank you, dear. What's up, Doc? There you go. Here, here you go, yeah. Oh, it's okay, it's okay. There you go. What money? Just stop! What money, huh? No, no, please. What money, huh? What fucking money, yeah, yeah? You don't know, yeah? I swear I don't know what you're talkin' about. No, I swear, I swear, I don't know what you're talking about. I have the money! I thought so. Upstairs? Yeah. All of it? Yeah. Okay. Go get it. I'm sorry about your pet. I actually like animals believe it or not. I just, I just like money more. Like the perfume of an old flame. It's all there, count it. Nah, bullshit detector, remember? That was all the money I had, I'm afraid I can't pay you for my stay. You know what? Fuck off, both of you. Now that I thought this was the honeymoon phase. Hey, did you hurt Spiderman? - Jesus Christ. - Jimmy. Baby, put that down, that's not a toy. - It's okay, it's okay. - Now, listen, listen, - Just let him go. - I know you got rice pudding where your brains are supposed to be, but this is stupid even for you, son. - You hurt Spiderman! - You know how to use that thing, kid? 'Cause if you shoot me and you don't kill me, I'm gonna snap - that little fucker's legs. - Hey, hey, it's okay. - All four of 'em. - He's just a kid, - he don't know better. - Yeah, yeah, then you're gonna have to watch your little bunny wabbit - wiggling around on the ground. - Hey, just go! You're a, you're a bad man. You know how to shoot to kill, Jimmy? Come on, I dare ya. - Jimmy, we don't shoot. - It's a free shot! Your mother is speaking - to you, god damnit! - I'm gonna fix the rabbit, - the rabbit's fine. - Come on, come on. He's not hurt. Get the fuck away from my son! Donna! Oh, no, oh, no. What did you do? It's okay, baby. No. No, what did you do? - Mom. - It's okay, sweetheart. Did you do? - Donna! - You're okay, baby. Who is that? Who? What the fuck did you bring into my house? Well, I didn't think you were gonna... You didn't think what? That one of those people you were runnin' from would find you here? Or that my son would find your gun, huh? I shoulda kept going. I liked you too much, I shouldn't of, I shouldn't of stayed another night. Oh, so I'm supposed to be flattered? I'm fucking flattered now? - No! - Mama. Honey, he was a bad man. He was so bad. But he wasn't gonna hurt nobody, he just wanted the money. He ain't a killer! Well, then he picked the wrong house to find it in, 'cause I am. When it's deep enough we'll go in and grab in. No, maybe, maybe we should call the police instead. I will kill you before you go and do a thing like that. Look who's true colors come out. Look, it ain't personal. I need to protect my son and I can't do that if I'm in jail, can I? Maybe I'll, I'll say it's my fault, I'll say I killed him. It don't matter. I'm involved. As soon as they find out who I am they'll put me away, too. Look, this ain't the first man I've killed and I don't feel about either of 'em. I'm not sure if that makes me a bad person or what, but I don't, and I don't wanna spend any more time talking about it. I got a boy in there who needs me, I'm all he's got. You got anyone who needs you for anything? No, I don't. All right, well you got one now. It's me and I need you to dig. That guy you killed, the one you went to prison for, what was that all about? You know, I was in and outta juvie my whole childhood and when I got older, jail. When I got out the last time I worked flooring for houses and it was one of those rehabilitation jobs they give you to walk the straight and narrow but I wasn't making any money it was community service hours. Then one day when I was on the job I found that suitcase. For the first time in my life I felt like I had options. I felt ambition I didn't know I had and it was nice. I figured I'd start a business of my own. I shoulda known better but I told the boss, he was my employer at the time and I figured I knew nothing about businesses, he already was the owner of one. Well, he was more than interested. That is until the owners of the suitcase noticed it was gone. They went straight to him, he pointed them straight to me. One of them broke into my house in the middle of the night. I guess he wasn't expecting me to have a gun on my bedside table. You shot him. Yep. Then I took off, stashed it, came here, turned myself in. 'Cause I knew the boss or somebody else will come after me once they realized the suitcase was gone. Money never goes unmissed. So I stayed safe. Close to 20 years locked up. Rolled the dice on whether the bag would be here when I got out. You stashed it. In your room before it was your room. I knew you didn't walk in with a case. You know, um, I was planning on leaving you some of it anyway, you know, for taking care of it for me even though you didn't know. Thanks. You know, now that we're in the thick of this, I wouldn't mind splitting it with ya. You know, I dunno, maybe we could, maybe we share it. Ain't that the same thing? No. No, it's different. Donna, last night was something for me. Hell, I'm sorry it had to be followed by all this mess but that don't change the fact that it was special to me, it was real special. I've grown sweet on you. All you gotta do is say the word. Now just one thing at a time, all right? I'm not saying no, I just... I understand, I understand. What about you? When you killed, what happened there? It was my dad. Oh. Yeah, I was 18. I knew I'd be tried as an adult so I jumped on a bus and tried to find the smallest podunk town I could find. Changed my name. Why'd you do it? One night I decided enough was enough. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. He couldn't of gone far. Well he's had hours to get away, he could be at the fucking police station. He's got a hole in his neck, he probably bled out. Well, that's not a chance I'm willing to take. There. Oh god. Cameron, put your hand on his neck, he's still breathing through his damn throat. Okay. Oh shit. - Shit, is that? - Oh shit! All right, come on. Help me get him to the house quick. Shit! ♪ I'm filled with dreams they pass me back ♪ ♪ Until spring they're only pictures ♪ ♪ Left hanging in my frame of mind ♪ Oh god, all right. Oh god. All right, just let me do the talking, you go by the hall. Is that blood, jeez, Donna, are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. Well, what in God's name happened... It's not mine. Oh, you won't even believe it. Well try me. Damn bunny rabbit escaped and got killed by a coyote. - Spiderman? - Yeah. So we heard a commotion, ran outside, coyote dropped the bunny rabbit and now we gotta bury the poor thing. And Jimmy, he's a wreck. He's still here, huh? Yeah, he's leaving tonight. Yeah. He pay you yet. Ah, good. It's a pretty big hole for a little bunny rabbit. Yeah, it is. Jimmy wanted me to bury him with his cage. You know, that way he has his home and. Right. I can see why he'd find that important. Yeah, why don't I go and grab your money? Thank you, Dona. Coyote, huh? What? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Must've given him quite a scare in order for him to drop his dinner. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess. Lotta blood. Yeah, yeah, we're gonna have to wash everything. How was, how was your night? You must think I got this badge out of a Cracker Jack box. Excuse me? I'm gonna give you two options. Either you tell me what the hell is going on around here or I put you in cuffs and I take you to the station. Either way, I'm gonna find out. So the choice is yours. I know what I would pick, but that's just me. All right. I'll tell you. How would you like to walk outta here cash rich? I'm listening. - Jimmy! - Spiderman? Yeah, honey, I need you to put him in your room, okay? Do you think he's hurt? Yeah, but I need your help, okay? Come on, hurry up. And what about this boss, we just dump him in the hole and that's that? Nobody knows he came here and gonna come looking for him? No. No, he's a solitary guy. I mean, he's got his business but nobody's gonna. They're not gonna know he came down here. People go missing all the time. Yeah, they do, don't they? - I think so. - Yeah. Well, I guess the big fat elephant in the room is Donna. What about her? Well, I don't know about you, but I sure as hell don't wanna split it three ways. I mean, it's not like she ain't gonna spill the beans with her past and all but she just... You don't trust her? Uh, yeah, sure, about as far as I can throw her. Don't fall for her looks. It's just best not to give her the opportunity, that's all. Okay. Okay what? Okay, let's not give her the opportunity. Honey. Honey, look at me. Look at me. This is very important, okay? We need to get out of here, we're gonna take a trip. To the store? No, baby, not to the store. To a new home. Someplace nicer, someplace a whole lot different than here. But why? Because we can't stay here anymore. Look, I'm gonna ask you to do the most important thing I've ever asked of you. I don't are if you never make the beds again or if the fridge stays empty, it doesn't matter. This is the only thing I need you to do, okay? Take this towel and soap and scrub this out as fast as you can. Can I trust you to do that? Yeah, I can do that. Donna. What have you done, huh? You got the kid. You got the kid doing the cleaning? Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. That kills me! That kills me. Oh my god. Here. Oh god. I needed that. Sorry, mama. No, baby, it's okay, you did a great job. God. I had a background check done on your boytoy out there. Holy cow are you two a match made in heaven, hmm? One piece of advice. Run your info by one another before you try to spin a tall tale. He didn't know nothing about the rabbit and the coyote. Where's the rabbit? Where's the coyote, Donna? Hello! It didn't take me long to get the rest out of him. Rest of what? - Zane! - You're dumb enough as it is, sweetheart. You ain't gonna play it. Show me where this Boss is. Wow. Couldn't help yourself, huh? Killer instinct got the best of ya? Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Well your boy toy told me all about the money. In fact, he said he'd split it with me if I let him go. Got rid of you. I don't believe that. Believe it, sister. He woulda cut you out of the picture the first chance he got. Yep. You should feel pretty lucky I came around when I did. Where is he now? He's in my car. Front seat or back? The back. So you weren't tempted to take that deal? No, of course not. I got certain allegiances. What if I told you I was prepared to sweeten that deal? Give it all to you if you forget the whole thing ever happened? The cash? Yeah. Let me bury the body and you never bring it up again, it's all yours. I don't know how much is in there, but it's not a little, and it sure beats you coming by here to nickel and dime me every time I get a goddamn customer. Well, look bitch, there's no world in where I leave here tonight without that money. Even if I have to get rid of Cam - or you for that matter! - Zane! Well, the worst will be two less fucking killers! The only thing you stand to gain in this negotiation is your life and not a damned thing more, you understand? You understand? Good! You'd pour me a glass of milk, I'm parched. Well, you were right, it ain't a little. Let me ask you something. If I do what you said, I look the other way. Do I gotta worry about the retard spilling his guts to the next passerby? Look, don't call him that, all right? Jimmy does what I tell him to do. You don't gotta worry about that. Well, here's my other idea. And don't get mad until you hear me out, okay? My other idea is we light a match and burn this place to the ground. Why would you wanna do that? Insurance, duh. Plus it's a nice clean way to explain the bodies. Bodies? As in more than one? Yeah, boss man and Cam. You don't gotta kill Cam, Zane. Oh, sure I do. Sure I do. This is how I see it. Someone falls asleep drunk, cigarette lit, blinds catch. It's a fireworks show. And since this place is registered in my name you ain't gotta worry about anyone finding out who you are. We both get cash, we find a new place, and I make off with my fortune somewhere tropical. Tired of this town anyhow. The lord took my mom tonight, God rest her soul. Sorry to hear that. Thank you. You really like this doofus Cam? I do. I did. I don't know. Why? He was kind to me. And he might be Jimmy's father. Really? Well the plot thickens. How can you be sure? - I can't. - I mean, there was a time when you first moved here, put a blindfold on, spun you around, whoever you landed on woulda had just a good a chance of being the father as the next. All right, Zane, you made your point. I even thought, I thought I might be. And what difference would that make if you were? Tell you the truth, I never gave it that much thought. Neither here nor there, really. I guess not. Yep, I guess not. Let me just ask you, 'cause I'll wonder. If I was, would that mean we have a chance you and me? If you were Jimmy's father? Yeah. You'd have to be there for him. You'd have to be there for us. I know. You can't just come by looking for a place to put it. Is that really what you think of me? And you gotta listen when I talk. You've gotta respect what I say when I say it. It's a give and take, relationships, you just can't be in charge all the time. I can abide by that. All right. Let's go upstairs. You. Donna, I'm loving the smell of you, Donna. What is that? No! You had a take something nice and ruin it, didn't ya? I said I loved you, Donna! I said I loved you! I shoulda listened to my mother! 'Cause she always said you were just a no good whore. Son. Oh my god. Oh my god. Do I have to clean it up? No, no. Look, I need you to get your stuff together and we're gonna get out of here, okay? Okay? - To our new home? - Yeah, baby, to our new home. What, what, honey, come on. I don't wanna leave without Spiderman. Oh, sweetheart, we're gonna bring Spiderman. Of course we're gonna have Spiderman. Donna! Hey, Donna! Hey! Hey Donna, let me outta here! He put me in here, it's locked. The door won't open, honey. You okay? What happened?
