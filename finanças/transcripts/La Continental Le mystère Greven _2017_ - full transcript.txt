Released during the Occupation Clouzot's 1943 film, Le Corbeau, shows a village desperately seeking the author of the anonymous letters that have been wreaking havoc within the community. No film better defines Continental Studios. The studio was created during the Occupation. To direct it, Joseph Goebbels, the Third Reich minister of propaganda, handpicked one of UFA's most prominent executives. The man, who had produced many films for Germany's biggest production and distribution company, was named Alfred Greven. Alfred Greven was now head of the new production company baptized Continental Studios. This Nazi firm received lavish funding from Berlin, far more than what other French studios had. Alfred Greven was appointed with precise instructions: make unambitious films, inconsequential films, films that would numb viewers. This is one of very few photos we have of him in the archives, which only heightens his enigmatic aura. He was obviously a mysterious man who disliked being seen in public. We know little to nothing about his personal life. We don't know of any mistresses, which is pretty rare. People who worked in film knew his name. But the average Frenchman hadn't heard of him. He symbolized Occupation. He was a Nazi. This being said, the films he produced were brilliant. Greven did what he wanted. He proved very competent. Better yet, intelligent! Indeed, he didn't obey Goebbels's recommendations. How can we explain his disobedience? Continental Studios: The Greven Enigma It is impossible to retrace Greven's childhood. We know he was to take over the family hardware store. We then lose his trace until he became a pilot during WWI. That's when he met Goering, who wasn't yet commander in chief. He was just a young officer, just like Greven. They became lifelong friends, as Greven's personality fascinated Goering. I believe he was an intelligent, tasteful man. He must have been pretty dashing. He's difficult to pin down. Alfred Greven was shaped by his heroïc past. He followed his new airforce friends and adhered to the Nazi party. After WWI, Greven started to work in film. In the 1930s, French and German cinemas were interconnected. Roughly 1,300 French films were produced in the 1930s. Among those, at least 190 were Franco-German co-productions. Some were shot in Berlin, others in Paris. When the sound era began German technicians trained in French studios French actors shot scenes at the UFA studios for bilingual releases Germans fleeing Naziism worked on French films People underestimate how porous the two industries were. On June 14, 1940, the Germans invaded Paris. All film shoots shut down and most movie theaters closed Germany had absolute control over French cinema. Continental Studios were founded in Paris in 1941, with German funds. Greven was appointed as the studio's director. What's unclear is why he was moved to Paris. Was it a punishment? Or was it actually a promotion? It was Goebbels's brainchild. He appointed Greven. To get rid of him according to some. Goebbels allegedly sent him to France because they both competed for a Czech actress's favors. It's possible, but we're not sure at all. As far as we know, Greven wasn't so much a Nazi as he was a friend of Goering's and other powerful Nazis Was Goering protecting him from his rival Goebbels? Who knows? Greven was a good film technician. He proved it prior to WWII. As was often the case during the Occupation, a competent man was picked. From scientific research to Champagne, the Germans always appointed Germans who spoke French and liked France, to supervise the French When he arrived in France in the Fall of 1940 Greven oversaw the entire French film industry: a production company (Continental Studios) a pre-existing distribution company (ACE) meant to distribute films in France and an operating company, that illegally took over networks owned by Jewish theater owners. This company (SOGEC) ended up operating 40 theaters. The Germans took over the industry's production,. distribution, and operation means. So there was a need to structure the entire system. Greven brought German orderliness with him. I'm saying this in jest. It's a structure meant for administrators. And Greven was one. It was both a promotion and an exile for him. And he had a mission to complete, which he did with means at his disposal. His psychological profile is that of a man with latitude with a mission, and with a personal goal. Continental Studios set up shop on the Champs Élysées. Every morning, Greven did the same thing. He hung his coat and hat on a Hitler bust in his office. After that, he would read the screenplays he planned on producing. Greven hanging his clothes to the Hitler bust can be read in many ways. It could be message to his French interlocutors: See, I'm not a Nazi! Was it genuine? Or was it a way to earn their trust? And maybe maybe people wanted to find him friendly? It's easier to work for a friendly enemy. That's not really an enemy. A few seasoned talents willingly joined Continental's ranks. Fernandel was one of them. In Simplet, he played the role of a simpleton who moves south to chat with a nightingale or a ranger. He sang 1942's biggest hit: "They Call Me Simpleton" Fernandel gave Continental Studios so many box office hits that Greven gradually let him direct the films himself. The ever-present Tino Rossi soon joined him. People sang his songs in unison. In Mon amour est près de toi he played an opera singer who lost his memory and sang "When You're a Sailor" in a typical pre-War riverside café. The press loved his extravagant relationship with actress Mireille Balin, who later left him for a German officer. Simone Printemps's husband, movie star Pierre Fresnay joined Continental Studios. There he shot a number of masterpieces including Clouzot's first film, L'Assassin habite au 21. – Where are you going? – Hmm hmm hmm. – What are you saying? – Hmm hmmm hmmm. – Are you sick? – No, mute. Because he spoke French, Greven felt unthreatening. Many knew him as they had worked in Germany in the 30s. So he was a reassuring figure. He didn't project Naziism's ugly image. How could people make films while the country is occupied? What kind of films could be made? How could one work without losing one's honor? People in the film industry behaved exactly the same way as everyone else during the Occupation. First, the Vichy regime legitimized collaboration. People also needed to make a living. The other option was to leave France, as Jean Gabin did. But unless you were fired which happened if you were Jewish you stayed, or perhaps worked in the Southern part. Working for Continental meant earning a lot of money. Directors were offered contracts to direct several films. Usually three films. For technicians, it meant financial stability for a full year. That was unheard of at the time, even in pre-war France. Those conditions were appealing. and most people felt they weren't doing anything wrong. Artists, creators, wanted to work. Many in Germany were similarly accused of Naziism. Composers, conductors... they just wanted to work. It wasn't ideologically motivated. They worked for those who let them work. Focusing on their work allowed them to ignore what was going on. Working for Continental Studios was depicted negatively in underground Resistance publications. It was made explicit that a time of reckoning would occur come Liberation. And Liberation came. Those who worked for Continental Studios got in trouble after the war in "épuration" committees even if they hadn't been involved in propaganda or caused any harm. Greven wanted the best, at any cost. Because he knew French cinema very well he knows who the best directors, biggest stars, best technicians, and best screenwriters were. And so he pressured all of them to join Continental Studios. Some people were forced to join Continental Studios which puts a damper on the notion that Greven was nice. He blackmailed Edwige Feuillère. He acquired companies in which people were under contract. One of those contracts was Mademoiselle Bonaparte. Edwige Feuillère didn't want to work for the Germans. Greven threatened to send her husband to jail. And so Edwige Feuillère had to make the film. Paul Meurisse was in a similar situation. The French police deported him to Germany. He had to contact Greven and was brought back to France. Actors weren't the only people he threatened. He did the same with technicians. Director André Cayatte was in that situation. Greven knew Cayatte had escaped and had a fake ID So he blackmailed him so he'd direct films for him. He'd use coercive means to convince actors and technicians. He didn't leave people a choice. He was first and foremost a captain of industry. What I've read is that he behaved like a businessman. What mattered were the quality of the films and box office results. He took financial risks at times. He didn't allow any film to be shot before the launch of Continental Studios, thus undermining competition. The first Continental film was released in February 1941. L'Assassinat du Père Noël The first independent French film was produced a few months later. Richebé's Madame sans gêne Over the five months between the two films, Greven had completely neutralized the competition. Continental Studios thus had free rein. L'Assassinat du Père Noël, his first film, may have aged but it was anything but ordinary. It was ambitious, poetic, rife with literary ideas, and visually original. It was absolutely not a standardized product. Continental Studios' editorial line was to reproduce what Greven knew of French cinema The first film, L'Assassinat du Père Noël, mimicked Les Disparus de Saint Agil Same director, same mood. Le Dernier des Six followed the crime film tradition of the time. Tourneur's Pêché de jeunesse perpetuated the tradition of post-WWI melodrama films like Carnet de bal. Continental Studios' editorial policy was clearly to prolong French cinema's pre-WW2 tradition which Greven found more interesting than the German corpus of the time. The studio produced 30 films, not all masterpieces. Some, like La Main du diable and Le Corbeau are. They are masterpieces directed by great directors, Maurice Tourneur and novice Henri-Georges Clouzot. For instance, Premier Rendez-vous and Decoin & Darrieux's films, epitomize the commercial cinema of the time. They share Battement de cœur's levity, which the studio perpetuated. Are you crazy? Singing with a window open! These people benefited from funds they wouldn't have had, had they worked for other French producers. People were given guarantees by Continental Studios: directors could pick their screenwriters, people weren't studio-bound by contract and so could work for other studios, and there would be no propaganda, which was important to people, who could legitimately fear there might be some. Was it a progressive approach? Or was it simply that propaganda films weren't successful? Countries had to maintain a local, national production. Indeed, audiences tend to prefer local productions. The films produced in war-torn France were distributed in occupied and unoccupied France alike. Either way, those features needed to be innocuous. Developing a discourse that didn't align with Vichy's moralizing ethos was frowned upon. Continental Studios movies did not undergo French censorship. They were not subjected to Vichy's control. There may have been an internal censorship though I'm unaware of any. If there was one, it would have involved Greven and members of the board. However there are no examples of films whose scenes were deleted or rewritten. That didn't happen. He didn't meddle with screenplays and seems to have let people work in peace There's a Zola adaptation which is surprising coming from a German company given Zola's position during the Dreyfus affair. The also shot two adaptations by Maupassant, despite his being blacklisted in Germany because of the short stories he wrote about the Franco-Prussian war. Those decisions prove that Greven prioritized Continental Studios. He appears to have isolated himself and to have had a rich inner life. Yet he was emotionally shut out from people. despite accounts of paranoid rages. I believe that he was immersed in cinema, which was a remarkable tool that represented occupied Paris and the humiliations people endured while at the same time stimulating people's imagination in movie theaters. In doing so he showed that he was anything but a dutiful Nazi. He was at odds with the entire French administration and with religious lobbies. Religious groups hated Continental movies like Le Corbeau, which were considered amoral. There's something very personal about the studio's productions. For Le Dernier des six, Greven asked that cabaret scenes be added to make the film sexier. This was contrary to everything that was done in films at the time especially in Vichy's film productions. Those were puritanical, not at all sexy. Yet he added cabaret scenes. He produced films that wouldn't have been made by Vichy. Le Corbeau and La Vie de plaisir were harsh social critiques. They were even banned after the liberation. La Vie de plaisir was released in May 44. It was borderline, cynical. It disparaged the elite, which was not shown as brilliant at all. and showed success as the result of nepotistic connections. It showed naked women. It showed stupid bishops and dim-witted aristocrats. Such a film couldn't have been made by a French studio. Such a screenplay would have been banned by the Vichy regime. It is thanks to the Germans that those satirical films could be shot, paradoxically. He chose to be a dissonant voice. Were those extravagances possible because he benefited from Goering's protection? He seems to have resisted what Goebbels tried to impose him. He was being disobedient. – Do you want to become a doctor? – I don't. – Fine. Do you mean you can only compose in anatomy class? – My parents force me to attend med school. Continental films caused Goebble's ire at least twice. La Symphonie Fantastique, by Christian-Jacque, was one of them. He sent Greven a memo saying it was a remarkable film. But people applauding during the final concert bothered him, as he didn't want French nationalism excited. He reminded Greven that he wanted innocuous, mindless films. Three weeks after receiving this ultimatum of sorts, Greven greenlit Le Corbeau. The first draft of Le Corbeau dates back to 1932. The original working title was Snake Eye The screenwriter, Louis Chavance, thought the film would never be made, "because the characters were mean and ugly and the story displayed the offensive and mysterious nature of mankind." Le Corbeau showed how sly the French could be. How they lied to, and were cruel with, each other. Some films were simply meant as entertainment. But many others subtly trafficked in ideas. Not only was Le Corbeau about poison pen letters. It also dealt with abortion and petty village mentality. Heavy stuff. The press attacked Le Corbeau. Audiences didn't rush to the theaters to see it either. That was a first. Indeed the press usually lauded the films produced by Greven and promoted them ostentatiously. Behind all those hits was Henri-Georges Clouzot. Greven had had the good idea of giving him his chance by appointing him to strategic positions. He first supervised screenplays and then became a director. Can it be said that Clouzot shaped Continental Studios' style? At least he left his mark. I recall the scene in Le Corbeau. in which Marie Corbin, played by Héléna Manson, is chased down the town's streets. The moment when she comes home and looks at her face in the broken mirror is an extraordinary moment. The last shot of the film is also sublime, in which you see the cancer patient's mom. Her cancerous son had cut his own throat with a razor after finding out in a letter from the Corbeau, that his cancer was terminal. The mother finds out who the Corbeau is and avenges her son's death by killing the Corbeau. She walks away wearing her mourning garb in the sun-drenched deserted street. What a wonderful moment! The Clouzot style is also defined by his casting. He imposed his girlfriend, the bubbly Suzie Delair. He launched her career alongside Pierre Fresnay. The two comedians formed a sparkling duo that would be cast in a few crime films. In those films, Suzie Delair always played a singer. I'd like you to take me with you. Every time I leave, you bring me back into your fold with your kind words. Of course, once you've been in a couple of good films, it leaves a mark. It inspires people who will try to follow the example you set. Tourneur's La Main du diable stands out as its genre differs from what Continental usually produced. The fantasy genre existed before the war. Films like La Charette fantôme and Le Monde tremblera dabbled in the fantastic. Tourneur capitalized on his experience in silent cinema in Hollywood. This sudden outburst of fantasy stood out in the French context. It is an atypical film compared to the rest of the production La Main du diable contradicts the German tradition of fantasy. Its introductory scenes count among the most unique in the fantasy genre. They're meant to lead us to the story of the hand. They introduce countless characters. While typical fantasy films introduce one character who will tell you the story, here, you're shown an inn with 50 characters introduced before the topic of the hand pops up. That's a big departure from canonical fantasy films Those usually establish a heavy, anxiety-ridden atmosphere. All those characters talking over each other postpones the introduction of the main theme. It makes the story skid into fantasy, which is much more interesting. I don't think there's an equivalent in French cinema, before or after. It's admirable. Continental Studios were a small community. With offices on the Champs Elysées, they attract mostly young people. People in their twenties and thirties. Some of them were playing with fire either because they partook in the Resistance while others were Jewish and knowingly took risks. Harry Baur's tragic fate is a case in point of this playing with fire. His story remains to this day a unique case. We've forgotten what a great, prolific actor Harry Baur was. He was very popular and had shot many films. Can't you pay attention? I asked for silence! I'll fire the first one who speaks. Who did this? Harry Baur was from Alsace. It's still unclear to this day whether he was Jewish and had turned his back on his heritage early on, which was common at the time, or whether he was an Alsatian Catholic who, like Charlie Chaplin, purposefully entertained ambiguity. This ambiguity backfired. He played with fire in the most extreme way thereby crossing the line without realizing it. He shot a film in Germany. He completed the shoot but ended up being arrested. He was officially arrested because he had "falsely claimed he wasn't Jewish". He can be considered a true victim. If he was Jewish, then the situation was absurd and terrible. Why throw yourself in the wolf's mouth? But he was the kind of actor who couldn't resist a good part. Harry Baur's life was not the only one at stake at Continental Studios. Others proved luckier. The most extraordinary case is that of Jean-Paul Dreyfus, better known now as Jean-Paul Le Chanois. He worked closely with Greven from whom he couldn't hide his Judaism given his name. Dreyfus changed his name to Le Chanois. He managed to obtain a certificate of non-Judaism because he'd been secretly baptized as a child. During the Occupation, a list was sent to all production companies. Those who appeared on the list were banned from working. Those who tried to work exposed themselves to violent punishment. Despite that, Greven liked to say that "Jews were the best at making movies." Among the people on the list was Jean-Paul Dreyfus, AKA Le Chanois. He wrote screenplays and worked for at least two and a half, three years. He was protected by Greven. Everybody knew he'd been a communist until 1940 and perhaps beyond. And that's not all! From 1935 to 1937, he was Moscow's seeing eyes in the theater and film industries. That he should work with Greven is simply unfathomable. All this remains an enigma. How to make sense of it all? I discussed this with Le Chanois, who thought Greven simply wanted to make the very best films and thus hired the best technicians. It's true Greven protected Le Chanois Meanwhile, the Jewish composer of La Main du diable was fired. Why the double standard? It raises the question whether Greven was trying to cover himself. He took risks, which hints at a healthy psyche. On the one hand he embraced political ideals, yet he made decisions that undermined those ideals. In 1943, the occupier felt the tide shifting. Germany lost a number of battles. Hitler's dream of a third Reich controlling the world was collapsing. While Greven should have been planning his return to Germany he preferred instead to pursue a mammoth project, close to his heart. Namely, building physical studios. Why imagine a future when the Third Reich was falling apart and the very existence of Continental Studios seemed compromised? Many hypotheses can be made. Maybe it's because he was very attached to France. Maybe he hoped he might be able to come back. Or perhaps he was obsessed with the idea of finishing what he had started. He apparently didn't have anyone or anything else in his life. Continental Studios were his baby. They probably took up all of his time. He most likely found it difficult to let go. To use our psychiatric jargon, there are monomaniacal traits to his personality. Those studios would be larger and involve greater means and more sets. By persisting in building those studios for Continental, Greven showed he was willing to compete against his own camp. Let's not forget that Babbelsberg's studios had been the only ones in the world able to compete against Hollywood. Greven probably had those studios in mind when he acquired new land. near Mesnil-le-roi. Continental Studios had capitalized on Le Mesnil for its future. But le Mesnil was a hole. I don't even know how he found that place. It's probably German officers in Army Communication who spotted this vacation spot. Next to Mesnil-le-Roy is the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Marshall Von Rundstedt had set his headquarters there with 15,000 men. The small town was at the heart of all Western front-related decisions. There were a number of quarries occupied by the Germans. Here and here. They bled into the forest. They led to Von Rundstedt's bunker in St Germain. It was a large network, kilometers long, underneath the forest. You could navigate it by car, and some areas were even paved. Nowadays, I believe 6,000 people live in Le Mesnil. When I came here, there were 600. There was a large terrasse, and around it, miles of land. Here, we're on the old castle's terrasse which goes all the way down there, and underground, you have a gallery that collapsed in places. Maybe you can find Continental Studios archives in there, but you'd better wear helmets. A number of officers settled near St Germain, like at Le Mesnil where villas were requisitioned. Those villas belonged to exiled Jews or to Parisians who used them as weekend homes. That's probably how the site was identified as an opportunity. Though we don't know everything regarding the Mesnil studios we do know Greven had the valuable gear sent there alongside the studio's negatives. for fear the studios in Paris might be bombed. Continental Studios took over the land of a Mr. Rheim. Since the land belonged to a Jewish banker, the sale can't have been profitable for the owner. Here was the castle's wall. This here is the orangery. That's the only remaining part of the castle. This now belongs to the city. Next door an condo residence has replaced the castle and its outbuildings That's the house! That's what it looked like when the Germans arrived. And it stayed like this for a while. They didn't destroy it when they built the studios. The chateau was here, and I suspect there was quite a bit of space, light and nature ideal to shoot films, though maybe not of all genres, and lots of land to build studios. What they built was huge. Two sets, indoor pools, outdoor pools gas stations for their trucks... When they came to make movies, people were psyched. When I was going for a stroll nearby, I'd see actors. I recognized actors who were there for the weekend. Executives were probably showing them where they'd be shooting soon. They were showing them around. But the studios were only used once. Only one film was shot at Le Mesnil. And it wasn't even a Continental production. The studios Greven had imagined were never finished. It was meant to be part of an even larger project, though. A project that haunted Greven as History was about to stop him. Greven spent a lot of time in Lisbon while he was stationed in Paris. Did he have the ambition to create some sort of European film industry that could challenge Hollywood while maintaining national productions. The consortium would be located in Southern Europe. A Mediterranean cinema would have involved fascist Italy, Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, (not quite democracies) and Germany-occupied France. The project perfectly epitomizes Continental Studios' ethos. As Greven's film alliance seemed compromised, Director of La Règle du jeu Jean Renoir reached out to Greven. La Règle du jeu had been a financial disaster in 1939. but he had an even more ambitious film project in mind, one that would make him a star director. Renoir got the idea in the late 20s as he was shooting Le Bled in Algeria. That's when he first thought of establishing film studios in Algeria. One of Renoir's inspirations was Pagnol, who had created his own film studios. Author and director Pagnol built a studio in southern France meant to become a Provence Hollywood. The experience of shooting a film in Pagnol's studio inspired Renoir. Renoir first floated the idea by Spain in the late 30s. Once France was defeated and occupied Renoir shopped the idea to Vichy and, more importantly, to Greven. I learned that Greven had reached out to Pagnol, too. Neither Pagnol nor Renoir ever worked for Greven but they all contacted each other. Was Greven thinking about it? Maybe. But Renoir certainly was. But Renoir was also thinking about Hollywood. A great opportunity. During a few months, he was both preparing his move to Hollywood negotiating with US studios, and writing to Greven at the same time. Renoir's departure for Hollywood put an end to Greven's ambitious project for French cinema. In Europe, things didn't look good for Germany. In 1943, Germany faced severe defeats on the Eastern and North African fronts. On June 6, 1944, the Allies deployed the largest landing in history on the beaches of Normandy. They took the Germans by surprise. The leaders of the Resistance encouraged Parisians to rebel. Barricades were erected, weapons gathered, and shoot-outs began. Charles de Gaulle, the chief of the Resistance, freed Paris. Germany was defeated. Continental Studios shut down. Le Mesnil's construction site stopped work. The Champs Elysées offices closed down. Greven had the studio's archives moved to Nancy. That's where we lost track of those documents. Some people cleaned house. And pretty well, since you're still looking! Part of the French-based archives may have been destroyed. Because some wanted to hide what had happened between Continental and the French film industry. It's a big mystery, though I don't think all of the archives have disappeared. I can't imagine the Germans getting rid of them. Germany was very organized at the time. Copies were made of everything. That's just not the German way. We may find them. Archives never disappear entirely. Surprises always occur. Maybe documents will turn up in the Russian archives? Maybe not. Maybe something will turn up in Germany that explains Greven's strange freedom. Greven was long gone. He's said to have snuck out of Paris wearing civilian clothes. He reappeared in Germany where he went back to an obscure film career. Post-war German cinema barely existed, so his career could only be obscure. I wasn't able to identify but a single film worthy of interest. To my knowledge, nobody ever interviewed him. Maybe he wouldn't have talked anyway. It's a shame. What followed perpetuated what happened in Paris at Continental. He was very discreet, as many producers can be, who hide behind their films. It further intensifies our curiosity.
