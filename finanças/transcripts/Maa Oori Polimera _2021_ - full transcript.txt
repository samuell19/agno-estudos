Here is your Rs. 3. Just Rs. 3? Who will pay for yesterday? Oh, no, I forgot. I will bring it tomorrow. You do this every day. Pay money and then take water. It is at home. I'll definitely pay you tomorrow. You fill. Fill only if you'll pay tomorrow, otherwise do not. Your husband has a debt at the toddy shop, and you're here. You are great. I will have you someday. I told you to wake me up while going for water. I would have brought the auto. Forget it. You slept late last night. Why get up early? Even the kid is accompanying you. You are worrying for nothing. Hey, Janga, when are the selections? In three days. Give it here. Husband just in name and absolutely useless. I would have come if you had asked. What would you do there? Started early in the morning again. I, for marrying a drunkard, and she, for marrying a coward, should face this. To hell with you! You always blabber on. What is wrong now? What else? The same thing that every woman faces in this village. Dirty rascals are ogle when women bend. These idiots should be dead. Should the whole village be dead now? No idea why she blabbers on. -To hell with her. -What is wrong? She's at it again. I'm pissed off with my wife early in the day. Nice. You should have it. -Hey! -Move, man! Hey, Janga! Come here. I'll come later. I said come here. Hey, what is wrong? He has selections in three days. Go fast and take a bath. The kid is getting late for school. -Come here. -Let me go! Wait. Ramula told me everything. I will not leave him. Did he say anything to you? Leave it, Janga. Why mess with that Sarpanch's men? How long do we let it go like this? Leave it. Bad things happens even when we do good. We cannot do anything to them. We cannot say all this and make your brother worry. This is nothing compared to the hard work he does. Chitti! Come on! Don't tell him anything. I will take care of them. I told you to forget it and leave it. -How can we... -Not a word! Why did you get on the bicycle when you have an auto? -You are so fat, idiot. -Who pays for the diesel? You wish to be a policeman. Pedal it and your legs will get stronger. My foot! Why go to the next village when we have vegetables here? You have no idea. My wife blasts me if the vegetables are not good. Oh, my. Do you fear Ramula so much? You will know once you get married. A wife will drive you mad. Why do you fear her for vegetables? She needs everything from outside and not me. -Hey, stop! -What? -Get down! -What is wrong? -Let us go back. -Why are you worried? Look there. May be a black magic ritual or a sacrifice. Who knows? I'm very much frightened of such things. Come on, do you believe in such things too? There is gossip about black magic being practised in our village. If we cross over such things, it is a pain in the arse. Get down first. You are worried unnecessarily. -Don't you need vegetables? -Vegetables, my foot! Let's do this; we'll go towards the mosque. -That would be slightly farther. -Okay, let us go. Come on, push. Hey, come here. That is Komiri, right? Yes, it is. He drove over all this. Did he go blind? Fine, move. SRI BHAVANI NURSING HOME Count it. I'm very hungry. Give me food. Get cleaned up, and I will serve you food. Lakshmi, I'm going out. -Hey, Malli! Is everything fine? -Yes, bro! Did the kid sleep? Saidulu, I'll talk about yesterday. Stay on the line. Drive the car there. Pleasure drives this world. The poor must stay under our feet. To get that, the women must obey us. Do you get it? Did you notice his ego this morning, sir? He was driving the vehicle like that. That idiot is egoistic, and that bitch is stylish. Saidulu, I want her. You first become the Sarpanch, sir. Then, she will come to you by herself. If not for the village, I will become for her. It is tough when he is there, sir. Oh, you say I would become the Sarpanch if he dies? Shall I hire goons from city? It should not be like we got him killed. It must be like God killed him. Serve yourself and eat. I will arrange the clothes and come. How many times will you cook this brinjal curry? My mouth is bored eating this always. There are no vegetables in the house. -You buy them in the evening. -Okay, I will. Tell me. Are you done already? How many times did you tell us not to get up while eating? What shall I do with the food now? Feed it to the kid. Where are you going in such a hurry? POLICE STATION JASTHIPALLI What happened, uncle? What to say? It is my fate. What happened? Tell me. When my daughter and I were returning from the fields, that boy from the landlord's family was passing through on a bike. She brought me here to complain about him, not listening to me. They say we hit his bike while walking, then hit us and made us sit here. Okay, don't cry. I will talk to them. Komiri, you idiot, you have grown a spine now? You dare to complain about us, rascal? To hell with you! It was a mistake. Please forgive them, sir. Have you become a hero in the village? You are doing all the settlements. Have you come now for this settlement? It was a mistake, sir. I beg you. She studied in the city and returned, sir. She is not aware of the traditions here. I will make sure she does not mess with you again, sir. Please forgive them, sir. We live at your mercy, sir. I beg of you. -Hey, Komiri. -Sir? You should teach her if she is not aware. You cannot be as you like here. What do you say? If you return with such a mess, I'll break your bones. -Did you get it? -Yes, sir. -Go! -Okay, sir. Why did you leave him like that? I told you to put him in the lock-up, right? You wait, idiot! Komiri, do you need such a mess in your hands? Why do you take all this upon yourself? Simple, uncle. I wish all our people do okay. See you. Come on. What do you study, dear? I studied journalism. I start my job after one month. I did not understand what you said, dear, but study well. Sure, brother. -I'll go now. -Fine, son. -Order one tea. -Okay, bro. Uncle, one tea. No passengers today for so long, dude. When will you return again? I will return by tomorrow evening. There is not much work. I just need to visit the academy and talk. Fine, go safe. Balija, you were not seen yesterday. Where did you go? He is asking you. Why are you silent? What's wrong with your face? Are you constipated? Then say what it is. Nothing. My wife made a mess as I came drunk last night. Did you come drunk again? Are you an idiot? I am unable to stop. My tongue itches by night. I don't know how to quit drinking. -I am going mad. -Do not make a mess! Look, there are two ways to quit drinking. One way is to strengthen your heart and give it up. Another is don't think about it and try to focus on something else. Keep yourself busy. Do you understand? It is so simple. You can never give it up by yourself. Do one thing. Be with me for one full day. Let us keep ourselves busy. Let's see if you still feel like drinking. -This is good, brother. -Yes! I think my bus is here. -Go! -See you, brother. -Okay, fine. -Now I have to listen to him too. Have a safe journey! -Start the vehicle! Always drinking. -Idiot! Wife at home and you here! Bro, tea. Is a film shoot happening in the village? The heroine is here. Madam, where to? -Auto... -Please come, madam. Why is she going in his vehicle? She is the Sarpanch's daughter from the city, sir. -Daughter? -Yes. How do you know? Last time she came with friends and roamed around the village. -Did you not see, sir? -What Sarpanch? He sends his daughter to the city to get educated. And he is womanising here. -Damn. -Komiri, we have passengers! -See you! -Go! Where to? Hey, you, where to? -High school road. -Come. SRI ESWAR VILAS MEALS HOTEL How long, man? Are you not finished yet? Wait, idiot! It just started. Give one pot. -Need anything to munch? -No. -What's the hurry? Wait! -Give it quickly. Take. Give one more. -Hey, Bablu. -Coming. Why did you come in the rain, bro? What do you need? -Bring one pot. -Wait, I will get it for you. How dare you push me down! -Sir! -Stop! Sit there. -Who is it? -Komiri is here, sir. -Sir! -What, Komiri? I expected his woman, but why are you here? It is a mistake, sir. I beg of you. Please let him go. Please let him go. We did not bring him here to let him go but to kill. How egoistic of him to lay his hands on my guy? You idiots are here to serve us, and what do you think? To hell with you. Sir, I beg of you. Please do not harm him. We live at your mercy. Please forgive him for now. We will do whatever you say, sir. You are so good. We brought your husband here to kill him. -No, sir. -But, seeing you, I don't want to. I feel like doing something else. I'm letting him go for now after seeing your face. Take him away. My house became dirty after beating up your husband. Clean it and go. No need to search for a rag. Remove your sari and clean. Get up. Hey. If you raise your hand against us again, I'll make your women sleep with me. Get lost! Sir. To hell with them! How could they hit a man so badly? What has he done? He never listens to me. He is always drinking. -He's finally degraded me. -Be quiet! What have I done for being married to him? Damn it! He is already feeling sad. Don't make it worse. Bear with it. How could you be quiet seeing all this? Our lives are so. Nothing can be done other than plead with those idiots. I told him to quit drinking! He is with me round the clock and did not listen to me. So, how will that rascal listen to me? I had to stay still when a woman was forced to strip her sari. Damn my life! No use scolding him when the mistake is ours. I had to remove my sari today for what he did. And tomorrow I may have to sleep with him. Ramula... All this is because of me. This would not have happened if I had quit drinking like he advised. Ramula, look at me. I quit drinking from today. I'll never touch alcohol again. Not for anyone but for us. I will quit. Believe me, Ramula! Be quiet. How did you bear with their beating? Wait, I will get hot water for a bath. -Sister-in-law, what happened? -Janga! Are you serving food here? You too come. Let us eat. Hey, Balija, what happened? What is wrong? What are these wounds? I am asking you! Why are you looking around? He fell down from the bicycle the day before, Janga. What? Who gets hurt so much falling from a cycle? What, man? Did you drink and drive? See, he's talking like a cop already for a small mistake. Not "like" a cop, but a cop. -What did you say? -Yes. Did you get the job? I even got a posting, brother. It is in our village. -Sister-in-law, this is for you. -For me? Take this. You shouldn't have, Janga? You should have saved your money. Is there anything more than a mother? Wait, I will get sugar. Why are you silent, dear? I feel sick today. I'm going to sleep. Okay. -Go. -You take the cycle, brother. -Balija will come for me. -I will manage, bro. Go! -See you, brother. -Hey, come here. -Go now. -Right, brother. -Be safe. -Okay. POLICE STATION JASTHIPALLI "Police station." Uncle! -Here. -Janga, you got it. -I look good in this dress, right? -You look great. -Today is the first day. -I know; sign here. Don't get overexcited that you have become a policeman now. Listen to the big people, and do as they say. -You should not oppose them. -Okay. Janga, you were stubborn and became a policeman. What do you want to do? I will show the power of the police. I will make sure wrongdoers are punished. It can be anyone. All are equal before the law. -I have a small wish, uncle. -What is that? -Any unsolved case, in... -"Investigation"? Yes, I want to investigate and solve it. -Hey! -Sir is calling. Go and meet him. -I will go and meet him. -Go! Oh, no! Okay. -I am sending a guy. -Great case on the first day. He will take care of everything. Good morning, sir! -Did you just join? -Yes, sir. Get the vegetables from this list and give at my house. Okay, sir. If he asks for money, tell him my name. Get the good veggies. If you take any rotten ones, I'll break your head. -Go! -Okay. Hello, uncle. How are you? Are you doing well? -Yes, I'm fine. How is Komiri? -He is fine. Listen carefully. Take good care of Komiri. -He's going through a bad time. -What happened? Just listen to me. His planets are not doing well. He will face danger. Take good care of him. -I will come over next month. -Okay. I just met the officer in city. I am going straight to the temple. -We should somehow get it out. -What if the villagers know, sir? I will take care of that. Come straight to the temple. Why is he running like that? Hey, Balija! Wait, I will call you back. -Hey, Komiri! -What? Hey, Komiri. -He is gone. -What? That idiot died like a dog. -Who? -That Sarpanch idiot! His car met with accident this morning while returning from the city. He's in pieces now. Why are you so happy about that? Not just happy, we must celebrate today. Did he ever consider us humans? How many times did he trouble us? He died because of our curses. Death is never a celebration. Would you like it if anyone feels happy when I die in future? It is not good to celebrate someone's death. We have Diwali to celebrate Narakasura's death, brother. It is a celebration when evil dies. He is evil, but what about his daughter? I am thinking about his daughter. Why is he so good? Forget about his goodness. You celebrate. BONALU FESTIVAL Ellamma, your husband quit drinking. Is that correct? Yes, who told you? Should anyone tell me? When you are drinking so much, what can he do? Shut up, rascal! How dare you insult me? You dirty idiot, you ruined my new shirt. -Beggar woman! -My foot. Yes, Lakshmi? -Lakshmi! -Yes? What happened? He went out at night and has not returned till now. Even his phone is right here. I am very afraid, Janga. Don't be afraid, Lakshmi. I will go and get Komiri. -Don't worry, okay? -Okay. Hey, Raju! Did you see my brother? -I did not see him. -No? Where did he go? Listen carefully. Take good care of Komiri. He's going through a bad time. Yadaiah, did you see my brother? -No. What happened, Janga? -Nothing. His planets are not doing well. He will face danger. Turn there. Take this left. Where did he go? Hey, look there. Come, Janga! Brutality in Mahabubnagar! A youngster was murdered brutally over suspicion of performing black magic. Does black magic really exist? Are people still living with such blind beliefs? Okay, sir, I will take care of it. Don't worry. Hey, clear off! These idiots are gathering here as if it's a film shoot. Hey, move this way. Do you know Komaraiah? Do you think he did this? Komaraiah is not such a man. He is a very good man. He is close to everyone in the village. Komaraiah is innocent. He never harms anyone. Two bodies in one pyre! One is Komaraiah, but who was the second? ONE WEEK BEFORE KOMARAIAH'S DEATH Kavita, I told you not to do such work now. Go and sit. I am bored sitting at home the whole day. The entire day you're at work. What can I do? You ask me not to do anything. Remember what the doctor said? She said not to do such work from the fifth month. Okay fine. But doctors will keep saying such things. You wanted to buy a sari for Bonalu. Shall we go? -Come on! -Oh! -Oh! -What happened? What is wrong, Kavita? Kavita? Sorry, your daughter had a miscarriage. What? How did that happen, Doctor? Even we do not understand. She suddenly developed a high fever. -There are rashes all over her body. -Oh, no! Her entire body is swollen due to oedema. We are treating the symptoms, but we do not know the cause. What is this? You said all is fine in the recent tests. What is wrong now? Why did she become like this? I wish I could explain it to you, but I don't understand why myself. I have never seen such a situation till now. So, now we will lose Kavita as well? BONALU DAY It is unbelievable. Renuka avatar. They rarely do it in black magic. -It is also very powerful. -What does that mean? -The girl will not live. -Oh, no! This ritual is very dangerous. Can we find who did this, sir? Only experts in black magic can do this. It is easy for such a practitioner to hide in the dark. -Oh, no! My child! -Calm down. Ramesh. Renuka avatar is done in four stages. The first three is killing the opponent, but the last is to save himself. This needs to be done at the pyre of the dead. What is that, sir? Observe carefully the area around the girl's pyre. He will be found. Hey, Malli, come here. What is it? Why? We need help. We will be at the street corner. If anyone comes to our sister's pyre tonight, call immediately. What is wrong, bro? Don't ask anything. You have the money for that. Take more if you need. Call immediately when someone is here. Malli, please understand. We are worried after losing Kavita. Don't go home early for the festival. Stay right here. Give me your phone. This is my number. Send a message here. We shall find that rascal. We'll beat him to death. THAT NIGHT 7.45 PM Where is the kid? He just went out to play. He is been roaming around a lot. Why is it less today? Who travels on the festival day? Wait! Why are you bleeding? -I fell down right here. -What was the hurry? You got hurt on festival day. The days are already running bad. What will happen to me? Your husband is a hero. I am going out. Where are my slippers? Where did I leave them? Oh, no. Are Balija's slippers around? He will never change. Whom do I trap for them now? Who can I get? Hey, Malli, what are you doing? Did you not go home for the festival? I am leaving, bro. -Whose pyre is it? -A good girl. God takes all the good ones. Give me a matchbox. Hey, Malli, catch him! Malli, what are you doing? Stop it! -You'll die today. -Who is he? Leave me, rascal! Bro! -Why are you hitting me? -You killed my sister. Sister? Hey! Whom are you mistaking me for? Hey, Malli! Come here and catch him. Come and catch him. -Hey! -Let me go! Yes! Hit him! Come on, hit him. Die! Die, rascal! PRESENT What, Balija, have you blabbered on TV? You want to live in this village or not? Sir. Look, your husband and their sister are dead. Whoever is at fault, it's done now. Forget about it. Here's what needs to happen. Take this Rs. 50,000. You may need it. They didn't have to give anything. I forced them. -Take care. -Okay, sir. Take it. It's no problem. I will take your leave, sir. Come on. Stop that nuisance on TV now. Go! Okay, sir. Hey, come on. Move! Why are you following me since morning like a thief? Is the money not enough? You should have asked then if you wanted more. Bloody rascal! Hey! Hey! Hey, Ramesh! Why did you give that Rs. 50,000? That is more for your face. How are you linked to my brother? Do we stay calm if someone messes with our sister? We shall kill and bury. -My brother messing with your sister? -Yes. Did you witness him doing it? Concealed by darkness, he killed using black magic. Black magic? We do not know black magic like your brother, so we went face to face with him and killed him like men. What business did he have in the graveyard at midnight? You rascals. You confess to killing my brother! Hey! Did you kill my brother? Tell me. Did you see my brother practising black magic? -Did you? -No. Bastard, then why did you kill him? Because we suspected him. How can someone kill based on just a suspicion? We settled with just one brother because it was only a suspicion. Otherwise, we would have burnt the entire family. Sign here. I can help you file the case, but I can't argue against them. Sorry. -Lakshmi, Lakshmi. -Yes? -Get ready quickly. -Why, Janga? To go to court. MAGISTRATE COURT JASTHIPALLI Case number 2401. Who is Jangaiah? Sir, that's me. -Who is your lawyer? -No lawyer, sir. This one in between! I will represent myself if you agree. Fine, come forward and speak standing on that mark. Okay. Sir, I think, in 2012, they broke a man's teeth, tied him to a tree and burnt him to death in Nellore district. This over a suspicion that he practised black magic. That case is not there in the police records, sir. Similarly in 2016, right here, near Warangal, they poured arrack and burnt a whole family to death, sir. Again with only a suspicion of black magic practice. There were even small children in that family, sir. Even this case was not filed by the police, sir. I have given all such cases to you now, sir. BLACK MAGIC SUSPICION DEATHS INCREASING DAY BY DAY ONE MORE BRUTALITY IN SRIKAKULAM AGENCY What exactly do you want to say? Sir, the same thing happened even in our village. This Ramesh and his brother, Suresh, killed my brother, sir. Just over a suspicion of performing black magic. Sir, how can someone kill with just a suspicion? My clients do not even know Komaraiah. How can they kill him then? This is a false allegation. Sir, how can it be a false allegation? Sir, the entire village knows he killed him. Forget that, sir, he said to me that he killed my brother. What are you saying? Why will we kill your brother? -Hey! -Ramesh, did you not tell me? When did I tell you, rascal? -When? -Stop! Sir, he told me and is now lying. You are just bluffing. -Talking like you saw it. -Hey, stop it. -Did you see us killing? -Why are you screaming? I was never there. He told me. Ask him. -When, rascal? -Hey, stop! -Hey, stop! -Is this a court or what? -Stop it! -Oh! She's so troublesome. -Why is she torturing me? -What do you think? -Where is the hammer? -Don't lie. -Hey, stop it! -Order, order! What are you doing? Sit! This will not be settled today. Shall we postpone to the 15th next month? -What? -Come at 10 a.m. that day. Go now. Go. Next case, 2501! Don't stare like that. Move! Hey, order a tea. Based on Jangaiah's argument in court, we've come to know that it's not just Komaraiah but many more were killed like this. Santosh, you think murder in the name of blind beliefs, as mentioned by Jangaiah in court, is still happening? Why not? Jangaiah said it. He mentioned similar incidents all over India in the past eight years. As far as I know, Jangaiah is not fighting for himself. He is fighting for all of us. What Jangaiah said is true. So many such incidents happen even in our village. But they just do not come out. Many are coming forward and supporting you. How do you feel? Look towards the camera and speak. Death should be meaningful, sir. Why kill for nothing? These blind beliefs should be gone. No one should have my brother's experience. So many such incidents have already happened. All those deaths need an answer. We need justice. Case number 2401. Are you present? -Sir! -Did you have your food, Jangaiah? You are on TV a lot nowadays. Okay, where did the case halt? You say they both killed your brother, right? Yes, sir. -Rajendra, shall I write "murder" here? -What, sir? Why are you just sitting there? Go. -Don't worry. -How can you write so, sir? My clients don't even know Komaraiah. No one knows who killed Komaraiah. His body was found in Kavita's pyre. We are very sad about Komaraiah's death, sir. We are more sad that he died falling on our sister's pyre. Just because the whole village is gossiping about it doesn't mean that it's true, sir. Truth needs proof. Do you have proof? Now you've come to the point! Do you have proof, Jangaiah? Sir, the only witness we have is Mallanna. He went missing since the day of the incident. No idea whether he vanished out of fear or took money from them. No witness. Case closed. It's over. Closed, is it? Come here; do it yourself. Why am I sitting here then? Sorry, sir. Sir, I do not have witnesses. But I have proof, sir. -What did he get? -How would we know? You should know. Please watch that, sir. Look, your husband and their sister are dead. Whoever is at fault, it's done now. Forget about it. Here's what needs to happen. Take this Rs. 50,000. You may need it. They didn't have to give anything. I forced them. What is this, Rajendra? What do you have to say now? -One minute, sir. -Where did this come from? No idea who shot that. -Hey! -Go and say something. Why are you just sitting there? Go! Your honour, it's true that my clients gave them money. Out of pity, they helped them as their family head had died. How can they say my clients committed murder because of that? Is even that a mistake? Now it's like that, huh? Say that just before paying them off. You settle first and then come to us. You take money first and then file a case against them. This will not settle easily. I will appoint a committee for this. I will give the final judgement on the 21st of this month. -Hello! -Rajendra. Don't worry. We'll close the case that day. -That is... -Leave now. Okay, sir. Yes, milord. Another twist in Komaraiah's story! Court asks the police department to give report within a week about what happened in the Komaraiah case. The entire village is on Komaraiah's side. The villagers are demanding that Kavita's brother be punished. The committee confirmed Kavita's brother killed Komaraiah. The final judgement for the 21st of this month is almost finalised. The whole village is waiting to get justice for Komaraiah's death. In Jangaiah's case, regarding the murder in Jasthipalli village 45 days back, Ramesh and Suresh jointly attacked Komaraiah and killed him. As per the report submitted by the committee, what has come out is that... Sir! One minute. -What? -What? I have something to say before you give judgement, sir. What now? I am... withdrawing this case, sir. What? What? Yes, sir, I am withdrawing this case. I am not angry at them, sir. My brother will not come back even if they are punished, sir. One more family will come on the streets, that's it. Gandhi said the soul of India is in the villages. But there are blind beliefs and crazy traditions in our villages. There should be traditions, sir. But for giving life and not to take lives, sir. Just because one person got angry and he had a few supporters, does that mean they can kill anyone? A whole village together has killed one person, sir. Maybe there won't be cases registered for such incidents. But if you handle this case well, there can be a revolt. Sir, please bring in a new law. A law that terrorises people who group together just to fight. Enough of such deaths, sir. Nobody else should die like my brother again. It should not happen, sir. That is all. Janga! Hey, Janga! Hey! Jangaiah unexpectedly taking U-turn! Was the fight for his brother Komaraiah till now just to make money? He admitted in court to have taken Rs. 50,000 from Kavita's brothers. And now... You can let your brother's killers go but not food. How can you not care about the person who gave you a life? You should have some loyalty. The people at home are making me angry rather than outsiders. Why are you silent? What exactly happened? Why did you withdraw the case? Hey, have you gone deaf? You are not listening to us at all. Why did you file the case and then make a mess of it? Did you take money again? How much did they give you? Why don't you answer me? What was his sin? He got a brother like you. Brother did it all. Lakshmi, remember what he told you the day before he died. Tell me every minute thing you can remember. Everything! Yes, I noticed something when he was giving money that day. He was bleeding on one hand. He said got hurt. -Blood? -Yes, from here to here. Why was he bleeding? -Which hand? -Right hand. Okay, madam. They will be ready by evening. I will take care of it. Where did you get this from? This is the blood of a calf. Okay, I will see you later. Sir, I am coming. Blood of a calf? Renuka avatar. It's very dangerous. Only the expert black magicians can perform this ritual. How do they perform this ritual, sir? It's the most dangerous black magic ritual. Hair, a dress piece and mud from feet of those on whom this needs to be performed are all decorated on a dough doll. It is buried with the corpse of a living being along with an umbilical cord of a newborn infant. The first phase finishes by sacrificing a calf after the expected outcome. The next phase is the process of saving the life of the doer. Renuka avatar is very dangerous. So, the chances of backfiring are more. This has to be done at the pyre of the person on whom it is done. He should wear footwear not belonging to him, be nude and follow the rules and complete the worship. Only then will Renuka be pacified. Do people practising black magic have rules? There are many rules. They must take head baths with 108 tumblers every Thursday. Their front doors should always carry lemons. Lemons changing colour indicate a mishap. One should not sleep across on a cot. He should not mate during the ritual till the worship is finished. I feel sick today. I'm going to sleep. NIGHT OF BONALU 11.43 PM I am going out. Okay, dear! ...12, 13... You did not go home for the festival, Malli? -I am going, bro. -Malli, I need a small help. See to it nobody comes here for half an hour. Later, you should forget everything. I will give you money. What? Okay. Oh, no! HEY HAS ANYONE COME THERE? It says "typing" and the idiot is not sending a message. He is doing too much. WHY ARE YOU NOT REPLYING? HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE YOU ARSEHOLE JUST REPLY ALREADY Where did he go? Hey, Malli! COME HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE Don't feel bad. We will somehow find him today. -You drink. -Okay. What is wrong? Where are you going? Wait, I am coming! Brother! Give me the bike's keys. -They are with Ramesh. -Damn it! What are you doing inside? Forget about me. What were you doing? I am paying you for not asking about that. Poor girl. She was good. God is like that. He often takes away good people. Give me the matchbox. Hey, Malli, catch him! Hey, let me go! You bastard, leave me! -Hey! -Don't let him go! -No, Ramesh! -Hey! -Hey, leave me! -You killed my sister! Hey, Malli, pull him off me. Hey, Malli... Save me! Hit him, Sreenu! Hit him hard. Die, bastard, die! Die! Die, bastard! Calm down, sister. He and that landlord's guys are saying Komaraiah did this. I don't know what you saw and heard to believe them. I will not believe it. I have known him for long. I know how good is he. You spoke about the Komaraiah you knew. I will talk about the Komaraiah you do not know. I felt worse that no one cared about my brother's death than the fact that he was dead. The mystery of my brother's death haunted me. I searched around that graveyard for evidence. I found a phone in Mallanna's hut. I gave it for repair as it did not switch on. I got a call from that repair shop during the second hearing. He said that phone is working. Balija, what's in there? No, you cannot see this. Janga, tell me what is in there. Did that bastard go mad? Where did he learn all that? What is his link to that girl? Komiri didn't live with us during our childhood. He was raised by our uncle. ONE NIGHT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO 2.55 AM Fifteen years ago, one midnight... Go in, go in! Go back, go back! Go back! Stay away! It will not come near you now. Make her worship the Lord at the Hanuman temple for 21 weeks. -What? -Nothing. TELUGU Why did you call? I need to go now. I have other work. I just called to see you. You see me daily at school. What now? Shall I show you something? What's all this? They are mine, right? You keep even such things? Crazy fellow. Hey! Hey! Why did you put this on me? Because I like you. Do you not like me? That's why I am not saying anything. Kavita! What are you doing here? Who is he? Moreover, how did you get here? He brought me here. -You want our girl, rascal? -No! Did you want Patel's daughter? Your entire education is ruined now. They will not let you study anywhere. Hey! -Uncle, at school... -I know everything. Education is just a way to live. That is not life. I will teach you the way to live. Come. I will learn whatever you teach me. But I will live with my hard work. So be it. Komiri quit school like that and learnt black magic. -ONE WEEK BEFORE BONALU. -One day in our village... Auto! Will you come to the high school? -It will be Rs. 100. Sit. -Okay. Kavitha, come on, get in. Komiri, we have passengers. -See you. -Okay. -How many? -Two. -Where? -High school road. Come, sit. Oh! Damn it! I did not expect my husband to be like this. I did not expect he had someone else in his heart other than me. Calm down, Lakshmi. Who knew he was like this? Even I did not expect him to be so cruel to take a life. Brother did not take just one life. He was linked to many deaths in this village. He killed the Sarpanch. He even killed that water guy. I did not know all this before filing the case. I found that later in Mallanna's phone. Then, I came to know the real truth. If I go and say this in court, all the murders over suspicion around the country till date will be justified. That is why I did not say anything. I am not saying my brother is bad. He did what he thought was right. In a wrong way. But he made a big mistake with Kavita. What did he get by doing all this? He thought to finish them and got killed in return. It is all my bad fate. Who will console your child if you get depressed? What will you tell him? Be strong. We can cry if he was giving life. Why cry for someone who took lives? Why feel bad over the death of such a man? He did wrong and was punished. Yes, he did wrong. But he hasn't been punished yet. Komiri is still alive. It was not Komiri who fell into Kavita's pyre that day. It was Mallanna. They mistook Mallanna for Komiri. Not willing to let Komiri escape, they beat Mallanna and pushed him into the pyre. I checked if the teeth found in the pyre when I searched for evidence matched with Komiri's DNA. They did not match. Later, I matched it with Mallanna's son. Then I understood that Mallanna died and my brother had escaped. Is my husband alive? Don't keep hopes up, Lakshmi. Cry. Think he is dead. Whatever his powers may be... he will die for sure now. Just see. Janga. Whoever does wrong, I will make sure they get punished. Everyone is equal before the law. Even my brother.
