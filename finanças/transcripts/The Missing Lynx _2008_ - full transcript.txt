Control 5! Over Do you copy? Are you sleeping or what? Oh, I'm coming! Is everything OK? Yeah! Looks like we got a new lynx... Yeah! Is this for real? Where? On the road to the dunes. I'm going to check it out now Perfect. I'll better prepare a great welcome party What am I doing? I'm not ready for this With my luck, I'll end up with a broken bone Ok, go away Oh! It's a Lynx! We have to take it to the shelter. Look! Isn't it the lynx from last week? - Well, is it your turn or mine? - No idea, who's next, anyway? This one will become extinct for sure! - Felix? - Yes? Are we there yet? No, another 5 minutes or so. How can you stay so calm? I can't stand being shut up in here This is the first time they've taken you to a shelter, huh? - Yes, and you? - Well, I've been there 3 or 4 times but Felix... Uff I've lost count already. Yeah About forty times in all. What bad luck! If all the other lynxes are like you, soon there won't be any of you left. Beeetty, please. The animalshelter is like my home it's a very nice place. It's that your idea of a very nice place? Three weeks ago it didn't look like a prison camp. Incredibly nice, this is going to be like staying in a holiday resort in there with my little hoofies having a manicure ...or maybe I'll get... - Beety, please... ...or maybe I'll get... - Beety, please... Spend as much time as you can with your cubs... Enjoy life Well... whatever we have left... We don't know whether it wil be days or just hours... I think we should keep a minute of silence for ourselves - Hey! Where are you going? - Same all, same all - Just look at those crazy eyes - You are dead on... The loneliness of the visionaty soul Oh Well! They'll regret it What happened here? Felix, old buddy!!! Gus! It's been a long time! What're you doing here? Follow me What's the big mistery? I thought I was here to get better but some very strange things are happening here I think it must have something to do with some secret government agency maybe unauthorized experiments WHAT! Quiet! But Gus, I was practically raised in shelters like this one and they've always treated us well Yes, look... we're not in cages anymore. If my wings were all right, I could fly right out of here. Don't you see? It's a trap so we'll let our guard down but something really serious is going to happen here Mark my words! The security measures are greater every day that's why we need the very best Yes, Sir, it's been difficult, but we finally found him ...I'll put him on - Thank you - Yes? - Mr. Newmann, this is Noah. Yes, hold on, please Now where's the darned hold button? Bluetooth? No Text messages? No! Wait... There it is! I do love simple yet effective devices Like this one Sorry, just a little matter I had to take care of I believe you have already been told the details of the job Do you accept? Sure, no one can say "no" to money like that I'll be there tomorrow You're paranoid. Nothing's the matter Ye yeah, nothing's the matter We have to find out what's going on I've got a plan In every prison there's a bloke who can get anything In here it's Rupert Hi... You got what I asked you for? Here it is, a lockpick and a torch Ruppert, over here! Oh sorry, I've got dirt in my eyes It's not the dirt... You're a mole and you're half-blind Soon we'll place a big order with you for the great escape Well, now that I'm going to be a father, I've got to work a little bit harder Let's find out what's going on here I'll lead the way Some of us animals are equipped for camouflage Sweet!! But you take a rag from there and follow me With that orange color of yours, we are going to be discovered in no time Oh yes... VERY discreet Oh no, his camouflage is out of sync! Who's out there? Bloody camouflage I said... who's out there? - What's this! - Shut up! - Ok, If you say shut up, I shut up... - S_H_U_T U_P At least those plants broke your fall They were nettles I see you still can't control your camouflage Well, my shrink says is all in my head but I bet you he just hates me ...this was the most recent theft of animals to be reported And the lingering question is what's and who's behind the animal's kidnappings. What! Kidnapping of animals? What's going on? Let me see! The authorities are concerned because some of these creatures are in danger of extinction. And the kidnappings are still happening Kidnapping of animals? The last truck is arriving tomorrow I'll breathe a lot easier when they're a here Those animals should get what they deserve Spend their lives behind bars I told you! - Look! We're on TV! - Come! We have to warn the others Since special security measures have been taken no more animals have disappeared I hate to have to keep them in those little cages and surrounded by fences but it's the only way to keep them safe Who is behind a this, and why? In spite of the surrounding secrecy regarding the operation It has being confirmed that the last truck with the endangered species comes today at the security center in Doniana We come, Mr. Newmann. It's a privilege to personally meet you in person Thanks Forgive me, you'll feel more at home this way I think that... This one will be perfect for you - Impressive - Would you seat down? I would rather keep standing up OK, bringing all those animals together in a single shelter should make things easier We have what you asked for a helicopter two trucks to gather the animals and your personal trailer After breaking into the animal shelter you will search the region for the rest of the species. We have also brought together a team of men to work under your orders. Do you have a list of the animals you want me to capture? Yes, a the information has been up oaded to the computer in your trailer Remember: I need a pair of each species and no animal must be hurt in any way Do you think you can do it? Mr. Noah, you offend me. In three weeks, you'll have all your little critters and I'll be far away from here spending your money to hunt animals for real. Don't you think you are taking this too seriously? It's even worse than we thought we'll never leave this place They said we'll spend the rest of our lives behind bars! Gus, I think you're letting your imagination run away with you Well, I heard it, too We have to be ready to escape Well, when I'll work a little bit more Very good, but you'll have to change faster those killer guards up in the towers would have shot you full of holes already! Very funny A right, next Saucy swimsuit! Look! More animals are coming The poor fools don't know what's in store for them What are the odds of the outside cable to come loose ...and touch the inside fence? - At least this time they are near by You again! I've got news for you, little buddy A girl lynx has arrived One of the few left. With a little luck if you like each other, you could be a couple ...They got you a girl friend Don't be stupid How's she gonna be my girl friend if I don't even know her... Feisty, isn't she! We'll cure you first and that way they can get to know each other Why are you so angry? Why? They capture me, they bring me here in a cage They have no reason to lock me up But it'll only be until your cured And not one second more! I don't want to end up like those halftamed animals And you? What happened to you? Ahhh, I got in a fight with a bear, a really BIG ONE sometimes I can't control my wild instincts You sure you didn't electrocute yourself on the fence? Your hair is standing on end you've got burn marks onlyour paws and, Well, I saw you when I got here I didn't want you to think I was one of those tame cats Be careful, there are only a few of us left and there'I be even fewer if you keep having accidents like that So have you two swapped telephone numbers yet? Oh buddy, it's your turn, let's see what we can do with you Yes, sir? Well, have the men present themselves here and then, what the heck... I'd like to do something about how this place is decorated. Right away, sir YES, SIR!! Wel, before studying the mission, you have to understand something You're under my orders and that means that you'll do everything exactly as I tell you to No thinking for yourselves... no a ternative plans... and above all, DISCIPLINE One, Two Three... FREEZE - You lose, dummy! - What the he are you doing? Oh, sir, alo, sir Sir, we were late, sir Calm down... A right, let's review the plan. Tomorrow there can be no mistakes Is he for real? Congratulations, Daddy! We just heard the good news How many are there? Looks like... Three? No, look, there are four And they're very cute They suck! More victims to perish in this godforsaken place Perish? Oh... We should be happy for him instead of saying stuff like that It's so beautiful they have been born in a place like this... Felix, we're going to throw pine cones at the e ectrified fence You wanna come? No, I told Lynxette that I'd show her the shelter I'll see you later. When we get out, I'll show you some places That would be great! Look! The tracking station Let me show you What's that? When they let us go, they put a bracelet on us so they know where to find us if there's a problem Watch this, it's fun What a curriculum! Yes but I apply Felix's law "Smile, tomorrow could be worse" I told you. Isn't bad luck? The heating is on in this weather Your luck could be changing - I don't think so - You met me Would you accept a gift? That way I'll a ways know where to find you In that case, I won't mind feeling like I'm being followed. I'm sorty I spoke to you the way I did the first day I wish we had met outside this place. We'll be out soon as long as Gus is wrong and nothing happens... That's better A most like home, right, Nimrod? You're impatient, too, hey, buddy? Get the men together. Tonight we're going HUNTING Activate silent mode! Now turn out all ights Sorry! It's ok How groovy! Put me down! You have tobe nice to me! - Pure precission. Just on the nerve - Ready. Tower 1 all c ear. Tower 5 a clear Tower 3 a clear. West alarm deactivated. I knew I was going to have to keep an eye on those two. - I feel dizzy! - Come on Pure precision in it, right on the nerve! Guard post out of control, according to the prior instructions ...given during the training sessions You idiot! We're elite soldiers talk in short, concise sentences. Oh, okay Guy groggy, following plan Much better Approaching computer Looking for the security control panel in order to access... SHORT sentences! Mr Newmann, outer gate open, proceeding to open inner gate - Something is wrong! - One alarm is still connected We can't open the inner gate Let's see..."mega-ram" records... I've GOT IT, the map of the shelter ...see Oh look! Danger! We got to warn the others! We've detected land mines in the courtyard! Any movement could be fata Number 1, don't take another step Relax, I'll guide you trough You've got one... RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU! Okay, Let's see One step backwards... another one... another one... Thank yo... Oops! We've got a casualty What in blazes is going on NOW?? The security measures are tougher than we thought. ...should we continue with the operation? - Morons! On my sign, pick me up in the courtyard! ...let me deactivate one. Is such a hoot Hi, boss! We've deactivated a most all of them I knew you two!! He pushed me! I can't believe it. Hey, boss, look at us! Look what we're doing! Caution, boss, there are min... You idiots, I'll take charge of entering the main b ock. Hey who are you? What's going on? A the personnel is out of action. Go get the animals! Now hurry up, boys! The boss made me the master. Coodination is what matters. One, two, one, two... Oops. I gotta go. I want a the animals out and loaded in the trucks in ten minutes I knew we'd end up loading boxes! The boss said we should secure each cage and tie them down twice I don't think any cages are gonna fall. I mean, that would be really unlucky ...the union rules said something about lunch break What's going on? Oh, no! Lynxette! I got to help them! Thats a of them. Lets go! Linxette! Ok, I'm coming! I'm done here. Hey! You do something for a change! Get the rope! I'll take care of the whee s "Be a mask soldier!" Damn thing. "Live an adventure life, exotic lands..." Yeah right! But nothing about working! Careful! Three of you go to the helicopter. The rest back to the truck. And then they say they don't want me to become extinct! Come on... Felix... Faster! Beeetty, they're kidnapping us! You have to get over to the other truck and wake up all the animals you can try with this keys! Sounds good to me! I accept the mission! Jeronimo! Come to mamma, little truckie walkie! Three... Two... One... Mr. Newmann, I think an animal has escaped What a disaster! Be prepared my friend, I think you have work to do! ...Turn on the head ights - Yes sir! I always wanted to do that! Yes, Her Majesty, the agent Gus... GUS! Wake up! I don't know where they're taking us. What? You see? You see? I told you! Astarté, wake up! You've got to fly to the shelter and set off one of the alarms But my wing... I don't think I can fly that far Astarte, you've got to try You are the only one fast enough to fly back to the shelter I'm eager to fly again, but I don't know if I'm fully recovered and the shelter is far away! We... Technically, you hawks reach 150 miles per hour... Astarte... We need you to try The skies are waiting for you OK, I'll do it You will? Yeah! I hope everything will turn a right I've almost forgotten how much I love to fly Lynxette, wake up! We're being kidnapped. ...what's going on? They're trying to kidnap us! But don't worry, I'm going to get you out of here I'm not worried What! Come here, my friend! Don't let her escape, Nimrod. She is all yours Astarté! Good job! Felix! It's Gus! You have to help him! He could be ki ed My tongue! My tongue! Open the cage and jump! Don't worry Gus, here I go! I'm slipping Good bye crue world! Gus! Just what I needed. A kidney stone! I think... I... run over another animal... again Any mistakes and I rip your neck with my bare hands! Lynxette! Jump! No! I have to free the rest! Damn it! That female lynx is the top priority. Nooo!! Ey, Boss... l... think... Never mind They were not keeping us prisoners They were protecting us! Thats why the towers and the fences... Yeah, tell that to "mister conspiracy" here, What a fuss he made! Well, if they were protecting us, they really made a pretty poor job. - What happened to Astarté? - She won't be able to do acrobatics for a while ...but she will be all right. She is a tough gal. So now what? You must go back to the shelter, Astarté needs some care. I have to save the others What? Go back? That's not an option If we go back to the shelter we'I never get out of there! For a paranoiac green thing with camouflage problems, he is quite right for once My friend, you are not going to get rid of us that easy! Yes, in deed! This is too exciting to miss Mr. Newmann? How did the mission go? We had a few SETBACKS! We've only achieved the 90% of our objectives Oh! But do you have the lynxs? Only the female. We'll go back for the rest if we don't have any more... MISSHAPS No, no. Just follow the plan We will meet in Bolonia beach at dawn I'll be there and please accept my apologies, mister Operation "Search and Rescue" it's about to get on the way! Oh, fine! And how do we just find them? "Super agent" Gus? Hey wait a minute... Lynxette! - WHAT? - No, I mean the bracelet! I gave her one of those llocators they put on us Of course! The tracking devices are back at the shelter! Geee! Wrong! One: We just said we can't get back there! ...and Two: You gave her a WHAT? - Gus, not now Are you mad? You'll be trapped for the rest of your ife! Just look at him. He's having a fit Wait a minute... I think I have the solution Whatever we could do without you, Gus I must confess that considering your reputation, and the size of your fee I was expecting a flawless operation The setbacks were due more to problems with the... "human resources" than to my hunting skills STOP! I told you to check the cages carefully, one by one Do you wanna get caught? A slip like that could ead them to us and ruin the who e plan! Oh, sorry, I can replace the team if you wish No, this bunch of idiots will be more than enough to capture your little critters Their inaptitude will just make the job more... chal enging Hey, number eight, give us a hand down here After years of hard work, my master plan is ready Look I had no idea about the scope of the operation This looks quite fancy Who do we help? Let's see... THEM! You are so useless, let me try This is like the county fair game We'll finish the inventory today and drop the report of all the animals we've still got to catch - And the ones that got away? Don't worry I've a ready thought something It's mine! ...the animals that are missing. When I've got them a... - What did I tell you? - They did come highly recommended! I quiiiit! Loading of cargo finished Brilliant! I know only one way to do things... BIG What do you think? As I said before, don't worry about the escaped animals. I found someone else to handle the problem I'll have a metting with him this afternoon Somebody bringing my briefcase About time Gotcha, crazy old man Let's see what you're cooking up There's nobody there! Who the heck are you talking to? Have you lost your mind and now talk to yourself? What's going on? Come on! Whatever happened with the operation "Search and Rescue" How long have we been walking? A week? One: Not even ten hours, and Two... We've stopped around twenty times just because of you Let's go Gus, We have to hurry before the masked man wil go far away Not "masked" "Evil secret paramilitaty organization" Can't believe he won't shut up not even underwater! Yeah, we're making good time... with a little bit of luck... A little bit of luck! Just what I'm missing... Let's rest now. We really need it! Don't worry, if everything goes a right, your little ones will be safe Mr. Noah, if you don't mind I would like to start as soon as possible Young poeple are a ways in such a rush! We almost have a the animals and just need a special rare kind of bat and most importantly, wolves But yesterday the most important animals were the lynxs! Yesterday was yesterday, and today is today If lynxs are difficult to find, wolves are even more elusive We have been searching for months to no avail You have to go to an area ca ed "El Torca" where you will find the long legged bat we need Then, you will continue on to "Sierra Morena" for a pair of wolves We will reconvene at the new pick up point and your m ission will be over I'll take it from there - Ok, and what about... - You are very stubborn! Forget about the escaped animals! I put up the money, you HUNT! When the time comes, follow my instructions to the letter and everything will be fine Now, if you don 't mind, I'd like to be alone I have to hurry up! Oh, solid groud! ...my Teddy! I fell asleep! I was born to be a father Calling a moles! Brothers, I have a job for you! Alpha 1 Red, negative! Betha 3, Red B, negative! Gamma 5, Blue 6, neg... I found them. Direction Alpha, two, red, B I bet we're following the wrong tracks Those were the track that were most look like It must be another track with simi ar tires The chicken just woke up! Beeetty was able to save you in the nick of time Thanks, I owe you one Astarte, I'm sorry about what happened I'm the one who's sorry! "You can get the shelter" ..."Everything is going to be all right" - He did his best for everyone - Maybe better for him, but not for me - Ey, boys, chill out!! - Fina y I found you And you? Where have you been? BROTHER? You won't believe it! I woke up in a big boat where a crazy man is collecting hundreds of animals I pushed my cage till it broke I wanted to free my family, but the ship started moving and I couldn't do anything but escape and look for help My family is still on board! We have to rescue them! But you don't even know where the ship is I did hear part of the plan, though I heard something about wolves at Sierra Morena They got to meet somewhere else as soon as the man has a his animals But they're still can 't find the wolves when they find them, they' gather them in a boat to a far away is and! If we warn the wolves, we can delay the ship's departure and have time to find it - Great idea And you? A right, count me in Oh, excuse me! I told him for a hundredth time but he just don't get it Sorry about that! Move somewhere else! Move to the other side, you are putting me off Sure, my friend, are we near the stone lagoon yet? Yes. But it's going to seem like an eternity! Close your eyes... so you'll get the full effect when you first see it! Let's go girls. We'll migrate another day Say something or I'm getting bored Oh! I see... We are playing hide, go and seek. Well, ready or not, here I come! Hundred, ninety eight, ninety, one... I'm here! Move on! Get me some space! Hi Good looking! And they say I'm a rare species! See ya! I'm so glad we got rid of the wolf hunting with the boss Absolutely. Choosing between hunting wolves or bats... bats, anyday! Look. I bet you they are there! One of the most precious gifts the quiropters have to offer can be found on the cave's rich ground Err, the only thing here is mud The GUANO, bat's excrement is greatly appreciate in the ferti izer industry "The long legged bat is one of the most peculiar bats" It's definitely peculiar "It has extremely, disproportioned long legs" Definitely long legged ...is just the color seems to be a little odd If it were black it wouldn't be peculiar! It's just like any other bat Ok, Let's proceed to the most delicate part of the operation Capture the beast! We're gonna get a medal the size of a frying pan Did you heard like an helicopter? Come on Gus! You're slowing us down Don't you find it suspicious? I've got a bad feeling about this! They are here! We're surrounded! Oops, sorry! Gus, will you stop being so paranoid? I've seen them! You're in a persecution complex! Suuure, "the chameleon is crazy" "the chameleon is seeing things" Get ready to run in case is those hunters Don't come any closer You sme I as humans What are you? Some kind of wild cat? I AM NOT a tamed animal Watch that tone of voice! You are a most a cat and I'm almost a dog... and you know what the humans say about cats and dogs We are looking for the leader of your pack We have very vital information which it'll be Only revealed with absolute confidentiality I'm one of the protectors of the pack And I don't know why should I trust such a bunch of strangers YOU HAVE to listen to us... Or soon you won't have a pack to protect You'd sound more convincing if your voice stop tremb ing But I don't smell a traitor I'll call a meeting of the pack council But if anything goes wrong you will be sorty! Here we are! No human has ever been in this place I'm not surprised! We'll be safe here This is our most secret place Hey, this is amazing! Hey, what's wrong with you? Nothing... I just miss my family Don't worry, everything is going to be all right That's impossible! Humans! Quick! There's a rear exit that eads to the gorge! Wouldn't be better to give ourselves up? Run, you foo! Run! Got'em! ...and now let's do some target practice! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! LYNX? GOAT! Didn't we knock you out already? Ok, first you... and then the rest The cages for the wolves! Yes sir, the other group has arrived Perfect, then we only have to take care of the rebels Are you pu ling my eg?? Nobody is that dumb! Wholdo think you're kidding? This is not a long legged bat! This one's stubby legs, and the color is wrong! We are looking for a GREY bat - That's yours - What? No way! And you two? What about you two? Do you have anything for me? Not at all, we didn't capture a bat or whatsoever! Nothing! Yeah! Come on! Next one! If it's not a bat, what is it? Finally! At least somebody knows how to do his job! Mr Newmann, did you get the wolves? Yes, they were right you said they would be... but something strange is going on here... I saw those animal that got away here too! ...I don't understand it! - You don't need to understand anything Just follow my orders, and we should finish the work in no time BYE! Hey Boss, you dropped your phone - Why does he treat me so bad! - Come on... They said it was impossible for them to find us there! It's got to be my fault! There's no other explanation Don't worry! I'm sure it's not you No? Something bad happens to everyone close to me... Lynxette, Astarté, you... How do you explain my accidents? How did they find us in the middle of no where! - Maybe they found us by share luck - Yes, my damn back luck How else could if it happened? Wait a minute! Of course... It a fits! They implanted us a microchip on the brain and they can follow every move we make from an spy satelite Oh, no, Gus! Please! Not again, Gus! Haven't you earn anything after what happened at the shelter? The only microchips are in the bracelets at the shelter Not bracelets! Nanobots! They drop them in your ears when you are s eeping I have an idea! Let's see... Just try to ocate us now! Let me out! Let me out of here! I wish you knew how it feels been prisoner in a cage Believe me, I do know But there's a good reason why you are ocked in a cage! Do you... Can you... understand me? Yes, you and a the rest of the animals But we shouldn't talk about this in here, right? Bring the cage 2203 to my cabin! What else could we do? It was the only way to shut him up What a great idea! A stroll in the desert! Hey, It wasn't my idea! We only know what Ruppert told us! - Who decided I was the eader? - I'd vote for you Felix! You got us into this mess! Chill, you guys! Impressive, now that's flying! Yes, but it gives me the hevee jeeves Where is he going? Hey mister volture! We're not dead yet! Make room! There I go! Yellow bin! Just a sec! I can't believe the poeple throw away! It's brand new! This goes to the electric section Oh, please! Don't touch a thing! There's enough meat here for a full mea and a coup e ight dinners I don't know why you are so disgusted! You eat FLIES! - Mister vulture... - Diogenes, young fe ow - We're looking for the beach - It's that way... Make room! Make room! What's all this? Good question We are tidying up the place - With them? - Oh, no they're just interns We have to educate the new generations No, I talking about THEM Sometimes, those bipeds do something worth while Calm down! How can you talk with us? Ah, that's a secret! And it should continue to be one I've always been closer to your kind than to the humans And that's why you hunt us down and keep us in cages? What have we done to deserve this? Not at all. Actually, all have is thanks to you When I was a child, I talked with the animals as all children do But unlike the others, when I grew up I never lost that ability I was that simple! I wasn't bitten by some radioactive animal But my problems began when I tried to te poeple about it No one believed me They thought I was crazy and they locked me up What a non sense! How could anyone talk to the animals? Those were the worse years of my life So, I kept my secret I found more poeple with the samelability And I knew then I had to use my gift to help you And this is the way you're helping us? Let me explain! I started sma It's easy to win at the track when you get your information ...straight from the horses mouth! I tried other ventures, that is also easy if you have a little help Things were working out pretty we! You know what they say... "Money gets money" And that's how I built my little empire Thanks in part to you So, to thank you all, I thought up my little plan... THIS plan! Mr Newmann? How is the mission going? It's a desert here! There isn't an animal in... They've got to be nearby I'm afraid not, we've scanned the who e area and... There they are, Mr. Newmann How the blazes does the old guy do it? What about you? What brings you here? They're after us! They're after us! Yes, they're following us, relax, you should learn Tai Chi! Bad news. The hunter brought that black hawk with him! That's not bad news, this is the moment I've been waiting for Hear not the voice of revenge for it wil ead you a stray Oh just shut up, you bug eyed beetle eater Where is your circus? Bearded lady?

GUS!! Come on! We don't have all day! But what is he doing?? Oh, what a shame! I missed! Yellow belly bird! Boss, we should leave right away! The wind is changing! Turn around.

Is not his fault If I go with you, they will catch us sooner or later Without me you will all be safe There's not excuse for what you've done There is, the end justify the means: To avoid your ultimate demise But at what price? You can't just capture us and hold us here because you feel like it Being held in cages for a little while is a small price to pay when you face extintion Soon we will take you to an island far away from humans where you can a live safely But that's still a prison There must be another way... Like what? Parcial solutions don't work Who many of you lynxes are left? Someone has to do something about it Tell me: What is the point of being free ...if you are not allve? But what's the point of being allive if you are not free You were caged once, would you like to be ocked up again? Do you see? Felix didn't have anything to do with it! We are going to get caught anyway We are loosing speed Screaming Eagles Squadron to the rescue Ready? Bombs away! Eagles! Eagles forming for a second run please, please, can I?

What are you doing here? I have... something to tell you. I thought I was helping you... and "Operation mole" is still on... mole? Well, I liked the play on words I needed to find the animals that went away and who better than a mole to be... a "mole"! How could you? So I made a deal with him: Freedom for his family in exchange for information After all, moles are not in danger for extinction I tagged him with a microchip and I let him go so he could find the wolves and then indicate the position of the escaped animals to the hunter I am really not a bad person... You what? Sorry, but I didn't have a choice They didn't find us because you are unlucky, but because of me So it was not my fault after all Wait! Good, you are just the one I needed to complete the set I don't think I need this This is small game Kitty, kitty Come here kitty Finally No! What? Mr Newmann? Stop the operation We have to re-think the whole plan Get ready kitty, you are going to extinct for sure now But first let's renegotiate the contract with the old man. That is enough! There is no sense crying over spilled milk! The important thing now is to find the ship We have ways to make traitors talk... Hold on! I don't really know where the ship is They were supposed to capture us and take us there So? Well, there's a way to find it: The inter-mole network Mr. Newmann I just was trying to contact you Things have changed... Yes, they have, a lot! I'm in command now! Are you crazy?
