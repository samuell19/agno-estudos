PAINTER: Well, the windows are finished. I've got the back bedroom to do. And if we're lucky, the countertops will be here this afternoon. You think you'll have it all finished by the beginning of next week? I don't see why not. Yeah. Well, good. My boss, Michael, just bought another complex and there'll be another job in it for you after that. Hey, working directly for you is great. I haven't had this much work in years. Well, pick up your paint brushes, pal. Get this finished on time and there'll be a bonus in it for you. Ah, have a nice Thanksgiving. Thanks. You too. Bye. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (CHILD SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) Hi, honey! Hi. Did you have a good day? Yeah. You want some help? Yeah. Can I spend the night at Emily's, Friday? I don't know. Can you? May I spend the night? Yes, you can. May I come too? You can ask your mom. (LAUGHS) Okay. Oh, Daddy's show is on. Let's listen. Oh, yeah! LARRY: Well, it's Thanksgiving eve and we're talking to you from sunny, southern California, at a high today in the mid 70s. And we're looking at more of the same tomorrow for Turkey Day. Now, back to our show, I'm Larry Schaffer. This hour's topic is controlling husbands. (TIRES SCREECHING) Ladies, let me hear from you. I wanna, I wanna hear what you have to say (MUSIC PLAYING) I know you have... Hey, you know that's a handicap spot. Yeah, so? Well, it doesn't appear to be physical. So, it must be some sort of... Mental defect. CAREY: Mommy, don't say anything... Listen, lady, why don't you just mind your own business? I'm only gonna be 3 minutes and I'm late. You know, you probably drive 55 in the fast lane too, you dumb broad. Can you manage that, sweetie? Just put it in the back for me, okay? OFFICER: You should have thought about that before you parked in the handicapped zone. These spaces are clearly marked for a reason, sir. People need them. I hope you never reach the point when you need one someday, and somebody parks in your space. I didn't say anything. OFFICER: Here you go. Have a nice Thanksgiving. Why do we have to do this every year? Because, honey, this is the only day your mom gets to sleep in. Besides, I'm a better cook. I'll tell her you said that. You wouldn't dare. I would. (SIGHS) Little weasel. Thank you. (LYNN GROANS) Mmm, hope you're my husband or I'm in trouble. I am your husband. (MOANS) And you are in trouble. Mmm. (BOTH MOANING) LYNN: Happy... Thanksgiving. Oh, you too, baby. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Open it. What is this? Twenty thousand dollars, Lynn? Mmm-hmm. What did you do, you rob a bank? No. I started my own management company. You quit your job? No, no. I still work at the same place. Michael was paying another company. So, I... Do the hiring directly and save everyone money. Including us. Well, how long have you been keeping this a secret from me? No, it's not a secret. It's a surprise. I started it six months ago. I wanted to make sure it worked before I told you. You know, I'm still recovering from this last surprise of yours, darling. You remember the handyman that you hired to do some things around the house. He was homeless. He needed a job. Yeah. He did. He needed our TV. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Are you guys gonna help me? Or, I have to do all the cooking, myself? Carey? Yeah? If you finish the pumpkin pie, I will do the potatoes. No problem. Good. (GRUNTS) You're getting bigger. You wanna help? No, darling. I'm head chef. I don't do potatoes. Hmm. I'll show you what I do. Gross! (BELL RINGS) (CHUCKLES) May I help you? Lynn Schaffer? Yes. We have a warrant for your arrest. (LAUGHS) Well, Happy Thanksgiving. Is this some sort of joke? I'm afraid not. Honey, could you come here for a minute please? Mrs. Schaffer, you'll have to come with us... No, you're not gonna arrest me... Look... Wait a minute, arrest? What is this, arrest? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't do that. Wait, wait... What did she do... POLICE OFFICER: Racketeering. Racketeering? LYNN: There must be... LARRY: Hey, excuse me, What is this all about? ...some sort of misunderstanding. Honey? LARRY: There's got to be some kind of a mistake. I'm afraid there's not. POLICE OFFICER: Anything you say... ...can be held against you. What's happening? Where you... Wait... Where are you taking her? We're taking her to the downtown station you can... You don't have to do that to her. Hang on a second here. What are you doing with the handcuffs? Take the cuffs off her. Honey, there's some sort of mistake. Please! CAREY: No! Honey. I'll be back before dinner, okay? Okay. Larry? Lynn, Lynn, Lynn! Don't worry, honey. I'll be right down there. LYNN: Larry? Carey, come on inside, honey. Get your shoes on. I called Brad, he's talking to the DA for us. He's gonna come over now for dinner. They tell you what this is all about? Yeah, but I still don't get it. I mean, what is Michael thinking about? (SCOFFS) What were you in for? Come on. Two counts of racketeering? I don't even know what that means. Well for one thing it means you didn't tell your boss about your new company. LYNN: I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. All I did was eliminate the middle man who was overcharging us. I saved Michael money. And you kept a portion of the savings for yourself. I saved him three times that. But, honey, he didn't know about it. Of course, he knew about it. It's in his bank account. BRAD: Lynn? Any money you save for him, while in his employee is rightfully his. All right, all right. Enough. What do we do now? They're offering you a plea bargain. Uh, reimburse the profits, pay a $500 fine and plead guilty. Plead guilty? To what? I didn't do anything wrong. Lynn, if we don't take the plea bargain, the only option is to go to trial. If we lose, there's a minimum three year sentence. I can't believe a jury would convict me. They may or may not. But, if they do, the judge may not like it, that you turned down his deal. He could give you a maximum 10-year sentence. Now, my advice is, take this offer. If I accept this deal and plead guilty, which I'm not, I'd have a criminal record, right? Right? Yes, but... LYNN: Who's gonna hire someone with a criminal record? And how am I gonna ever be able to get another job? What am I gonna tell my daughter, when she asks me... Are you going to jail? No, sweetheart. I'm not going anywhere, honey. No, no. This is just a simple misunderstanding. Lynn? You have to take this deal. You're forgetting one thing. I'm innocent. And I'm not gonna plead guilty to something that I did not do. Let's go brush our teeth. (EXHALES) Honey? I just wanted to make some extra money. That's not what I'm talking about, Lynn. You're not talking at all. Did you talk to me, before you started your company? You know... You always do these things for the right reasons but they always turn out the same. You act and then you think. What if we lose in court? What then? JUDGE: Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict? JURY FOREMAN: We have your honor. JUDGE: Please, proceed. Count one, conflict of interest. We the jury, find the defendant, Lynn Schaffer, guilty. Count two, fraudulent concealment. We the jury, find the defendant, Lynn Schaffer, guilty. JUDGE: Mrs. Schaffer, you're released for the weekend on your own recognizance. You're to report to this court, Monday morning at 9:00 a.m., to receive your sentencing. Court dismissed! (SIGHS) This place is such a mess. I gotta get this organized. You don't have to do this, Lynn. Yes I do, Larry! I mean, you don't even know how to fold a towel for God's sake! And I'm not gonna be here. (SOBBING) CAREY: Why didn't the judge believe you, Mommy? He just didn't understand. But, Brad is going to take me to see him again. And I'll explain it to him better next time. Okay? How long will you be gone? Not long, I promise. I'll call all the time and you can come see me, okay? Okay. Carey, you're gonna have to try to be brave. Really brave. Can you do that? Why can't we just run away? Far away. Where no one can ever find us. JUDGE: Mrs. Schaffer, I hereby sentence you to serve the maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. No! Ten years? Your honor, this is excessive! You can't do this! You're punishing me just because... JUDGE: Mrs. Schaffer! Your sentence is to be served at the Delory women's correctional facility, commencing immediately. No! GUARD: Settle down. LYNN: No, you can't do this! Come on! My family! You, you can't... No! No! (GASPING) You can't do this. (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) GUARD: Let's go. This is dorm four, where you'll be housed. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) INMATE: Oh, you wanna fight me? You wanna fight me? Ooh, yeah! INMATE: What's it to you? You know that. (INMATE COUGHS) (INMATES JEERING) (COUGHS) INMATE: Whoo-hoo! (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (LYNN SIGHS) GUARD: I know it's not easy. LYNN: There we go. Hair clip, please. (SIGHS) Arms up. (WHISPERS) Oh, my God! (SOBS SILENTLY) Bend over, please. (COUGHS) (EXHALING LOUDLY) (CRYING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (INMATE CACKLING) INMATE: You tell her like it is... Tell her like it is. You can come sit by me, if you like. ALL: Whoo! Schaffer, come here. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) You're done. (INMATES LAUGHING) INMATE: All yours. All yours. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE) WOMAN: (ON TV) What lies in that direction? MAN: (ON TV) More of the same. WOMAN: No, but beyond that. MAN: Kingsley. You're right. Kingsley... She'll call. MAN: What about him? Don't worry, honey. He don't interest you? WOMAN: Not now. His leg... (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Look, forget it. Uh, my turn. No, I was... Umm-hmm. ANGIE: Hi, uh... All right. 2-1-3. Umm-hmm. (SNIFFS) 5-5-5. Uh, 8-4-7-5. (DOG BARKING) Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. (INMATE COUGHING) Isn't there supposed to be some sort of time limit on this? That's it Angie. Bye. Time's up, ladies. INMATE: Oh. This sucks. This sucks. INMATE 2: Get outta here. (SPITS NOISILY) You know how I can get a toothbrush? I know how I got mine. Uh, wouldn't recommend that for you. You can borrow it if you want. That's okay. Too good for me, huh? No, I... I see you making friends. I'm Frannie. Lynn. That woman, what's she in here for? Angie? Same thing as most everybody else in here. Drugs, prostitution. And you? Me? Nah, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. My old man, killed somebody robbing a store. I didn't even know what was going down. They got me as an accessory. (SIGHS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (MARIA MOANING) (SCREAMING) (THUDS) Ow. (MOANING CONTINUES) INMATE: Oh, come on! Harriet, go shut her up. Relax, it's only Maria. FRANNIE: It's one of her nightmares. Crazy bitch. (SCREAMS) No, no! (GASPS) (WHISPERS) What happened to her? She fought back. (HARRIET SINGING) * And neither have * High wings to fly (HARRIET HUMMING) Come on, Harriet. Pick it up. You got a problem? Come on. Sergeant Crang, there's a few things I need. See that yellow line? It's three feet from this desk. Don't come inside that line. Oh. I was wondering if... Don't talk to an ACO, unless you're acknowledged. Hmm. Yes? Toothbrush. Hmm. You have to sign for it. Thank you, sir. Mmm-hmm. You're welcome. Hey, Stu, Ed wants you in dorm four. (LAUGHS) Oh, damn! (INMATE COUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) (SNIFFLES) (SNIFFLING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Hey, Carey, I heard your mom's a famous movie star. Yeah, she's on America's Most Wanted. (LAUGHS) Hey, Carey, I could use a new bike. Do you mind stealing for us? My mom didn't steal! Don't pay any attention to them. They're stupid, anyway! Yeah, yeah. Frannie, what happened last night? Where'd they take Angie and Betsy? What you doing? You working together? Come on! Warden Steward. Wish they'd share some of their gardening tips with the guys. Not too many green thumbs at the men's facility, huh? Last time I saw a guy with a shovel, he was trying to dig his way out. (LAUGHS) Oh, that shipment of computers is coming in next week. Take what we need over at the men's facility and I'll send you the rest. I'll see they get put in classrooms, sir. GUARD: Go get us some water, would you? GUARD: Put them away! Get in line! All right, go ahead. Next. I'll take it from here. Put your hands behind your head. What are you doing? (SNICKERS) GUARD: Schaffer! Go. Want some dessert? (SIGHS) Oh, honey! No touching, Schaffer (LYNN SNIFFLES) Come on. (SIGHS) I'm so glad to see you two. It's been the longest week of my life. We waited for you to call us, every night. Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. They have rules here and I can't just make a phone call anytime I want. It just felt like Saturday would never get here, honey. God, I miss you. You okay, Lynn? So, is your dad helping you with your math homework? Hmm, oh, boy. Yeah. You're better at it. Hmm. Tired? You sleeping? You know, I'm trying to. CARLA: If you're not gonna listen to them, at least listen to me. JULIE: Like I'm really gonna listen to you. At least, I'm not stupid enough to end up in prison. LYNN: How's art class? You doing anymore drawings? CARLA: These are the rules, whether you like it or not, I am... I just got her a brand new paint set. CARLA: ...listen to me. JULIE: You wanna go through this again? Yeah, for the last five years, you're a mother every visiting day. You taking care of your daddy? Oh, yeah. She's keeping me alive. She's making me do everything, the way you do. (CHUCKLES AND SNIFFLES) When are you coming home? Soon. Honey, real soon. INMATE: (LAUGHS) Stupid bitch. Lynn, listen. I talked to Brad and he's got your appeal almost ready. You should meet your mom in the playground next week. Carey! Thank you. She's not allowed to chew gum. Mom? (INFANT CRYING) BRAD: What's the deal? It's just gum. Right this way, folks. Let's go. MAN: Here we are. Wait a second, honey. Wave to Mommy. Wave. What's he doing? Why is he touching Mommy? You son of a bitch! Hey! Hey! (CHUCKLES) That's my wife! Come here. Come on. Come on. (SIGHS) LARRY: Though we usually don't play dedications here, I think, in this case, I'm gonna make an exception. Lynn... This is for you. (SAD SONG PLAYING) * Miles away * In a far and distant place (SIGHS) * I'll await the day * When I can finally see your face * Time will tell Like she's really gonna hear it. She's in prison. They have radios in prison, for your information. Why do I have to be here? I told you why, because I'm not gonna leave you home alone. You left mom alone. You let that man touch her. You didn't even help her. * You'll always have a friend in times of pain (DOOR CLOSES) * My love for you grows stronger everyday * Though you're miles away Whoa! There you are. Thought, maybe you had escaped. No such luck. Lucky for who? You or me? Excuse me! You know, I can make life a little easier for you in here. You know what I mean, like one hand washing the other. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) How long are you in for? Life. What did you do? My daughter was raped. The police didn't do anything. I did. You killed him. (DOOR OPENS) (SHUSHES) (DOOR CLOSES LOUDLY) No. No, no. (WHIMPERING) (WHISPERS) Shut up! LYNN: Frannie? (WHIMPERS) Shut up! (BETSY SCREAMING) No! No! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) What are they do... Frannie, what... (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Why do I have to move? You'll get used to it. INMATE: Bring it over here. ED: You about ready Schaffer? Yeah. I got good news for you, Frannie. Starting tonight, you're on laundry duty. Hurry up, Schaffer. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (SIGHS) Looks like we're roommates now. (GROANS) What... What are you doing? (GROANS) (TOILET FLUSHES) ED: That's all, Angie. You know, Sheila, the last person who had your job... (CLEARS THROAT) ...didn't work out. But you, I think you got the potential to move up. Maybe, even get a raise. I'd appreciate that, sir. I'm very grateful for this job. Good. Good. Why don't you make your rounds, make sure everything's locked up tight. Yes, sir. Sheila? Next time you knock. (WHIRRING) (KNOCKING) Carey? Carey! Carey? Carey, are you out here? (CAREY SOBBING) Carey, I think we need to talk about this. First, she wasn't gonna go to jail. Then, she promised she would be home, soon. She lied! She's never coming home. I know that it feels that way to you, honey. You get to see her tomorrow. I'm not going! I can't go back there. Please, Daddy! Where's my husband? I don't know. Where is he? LARRY: Lynn! I was beginning to think you weren't coming. Couldn't find my name on the list. What the hell is going on in here, Lynn? Where's Carey? She didn't wanna come, Lynn. Not after what happened the last time. She just, uh... I've never seen her this upset before. My poor baby. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't... Honey, honey. What about you? How are you doing? You all right? This place is hell, Larry. Some of the guards are... Forcing the women into... (SIGHS) Having sex. What? They haven't done anything to me, but, I've seen it with Angie and Betsy. And now they've... They've started it on Frannie. I've gotta help them. OFFICER: Okay, everybody! Visiting hour's over. Lynn, those women mean nothing to you. You have to stay safe. Honey, your appeal is coming up. You cannot get involved. I may not have that choice. Your letter came back. Not enough postage. I would have put a stamp on it, but, um... The warden, he frowns on that. I tried to write it all down, Larry, about Frannie. But he confiscated the letter. (CUTS PHONE) (GROANING) LYNN: No! No! (CLOTHES TEARING) (GRUNTS) (ALARM RINGING) You learn the rules, Schaffer. (GROANS) Your husband's waiting on you, Schaffer. I had to make myself presentable. Ah, you should have thought of that before. Before what? You hit me? Get lost. You know, the warden got the paperwork on that. Says, you had an accident in the garden. LARRY: Lynn? Oh, my God! What happened to you? No touching. I'm not, I'm not touching, okay? I'm not. Who did that to you? Lynn? Not now. Oh, my... Did they rape you? No. Then tell me who did this to you? How's work? What's new with your job? Lynn? Tell me this time. Be honest with me. Carey still won't come? Please tell me, who did this? Larry! God, Lynn! Tell Carey I miss her. Tell her, I need to see her. (ED CHUCKLES) (DOOR CLOSES) He's all yours. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hi, Larry. Hey, have you seen Carey's artwork? Uh, no, not yet. But she's been excited all week, to show me this masterpiece. Mmm, but don't tell the other parents, it's my favorite. Aw. Come on, Daddy. This is Mrs. Nun's favorite picture I've done. Oh, honey, this is... This is beautiful. Hi, Larry! Hi. How are you? Oh, good, Joan. How are you? JOAN: Good, thanks. How's Lynn doing? She's doing fine. (LAUGHING) Look at her. JOAN: How long will she been gone? We filed the appeal, so, not much longer we hope. BOY: (LAUGHING) How does your mom like jail? WOMAN: Zachary. (LAUGHING) Carey! Carey! (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) (THUDS) (SCREAMING) Betsy, what's the matter? Oh, my God, she needs a doctor, somebody quick get a doctor. Move out of way. Get out of here. Go back to your bunks. What the hell is this? She needs a doctor! We got to get her to the infirmary. (BETSY GROANING) Come on, move back. Get out of the way! Stu! Stu, don't just stand there, help me, damn it. (BETSY WHIMPERING) (PANTING) (GUARD SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) She miscarried, lost her baby. Betsy was pregnant? Yeah. Lost a lot of blood but she's going to be okay, (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GASPS) Warden's worried about you, Schaffer. Me? Uh-huh. Uh, your husband made a phone call to Warden Steward himself. Seems he is concerned about your well-being. And the warden asked me to look into it. (CHUCKLES) Make sure everything is all right. (SCOFFS) You're in good hands now, baby. (CHUCKLES) Hot. (INMATE SHRIEKING) GUARD: Hey. (SHOUTING) No, please. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES) (ENGINE STARTING) LYNN: (WHISPERING) What the hell was that? Carla, you load the van, you must know. (EXHALES LOUDLY) (SIGHS) (FRANNIE RETCHING) LYNN: God! (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) (GRUNTING) Watch out. Come on. Come on. All right. (COUGHS) Wait a minute. (GROANING) (GASPS) What... What... Lynn... (MUMBLING) (MOUTHING) Come on. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) I'm so sorry, baby. CHILD: Mommy, run! I know how hard this is on you and Daddy. Hmm. (SNIFFLES) I never imagined it would all happen like this. I'll be okay. Please try to understand. I thought I was doing the right thing. I'm trying, Mommy. You're growing up so fast. You wanna push me on the swings? I'll be right over. I just want to talk to your daddy for a minute. Okay. Okay. Going to the warden didn't help, Larry. (CLICKS TONGUE) I want you to go on the air. You can help stop what's going on in here. What are you talking about? Frannie's been in the infirmary for three days. They drugged her, handcuffed her... God knows what else. Lynn, you still don't get it, do you? It's your sense of always wanting to do the right thing, no matter what it does to anybody else, that got you here in the first place. CAREY: Mom, come on! (WHISPERING) Larry, listen to me... If they can do it to Frannie, they can do it to me. (CHILDREN PLAYING) (TYPING) It's called a C prompt or a DOS prompt. Just type in the name of your file and presto. There you go. Now, your file should appear right on your screen. INMATE: Oh, yeah. TEACHER: Everybody have your file open? Okay. Just start typing, just like a typewriter. Don't worry about errors right now. Try and learn the keys. (INMATE LAUGHING) INMATE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. Hey, Carey, they let you out on good behavior? Shut up, Zach. Oh, what are you going to do? Get your mom to beat us up? Shut up! Hey, Carey, you know, you look great in stripes. Just like your mom! (GRUNTS) Your mom steals and you know it. She doesn't steal! ZACH: Yeah, she does! No, she does not! She stole that money. No, she didn't! ZACH: Yeah, you know she did. (LARRY GRUNTS) Peter... Zach... I think you should go home now. (PANTING) You know... You're the one who should be locked up. I had to. He was making fun of Mom. I know. Sometimes you have to fight, huh? Yeah. Come here. Come on. Here's something for you. Thanks. SHEILA: Do you want to go to the playground? CAREY: Can I? Okay, Mum? Let's go play. You can bring a civil suit against the prison. There's a good chance you can be awarded monetary damages. I don't want money. I want the abuse to stop. Then I can ask the court for an injunction against the guards. (LARRY SHUSHING) (LOUDLY) This is the sweetest card. Carey made it herself? Yup, she sure did. BRAD: Let me see. Oh, that's great. (CHUCKLES) LYNN: It's not enough. Okay... I'll need evidence, witnesses... I am a witness. Hard evidence, not just your word against theirs. Watch him. I'll need testimony, signed affidavits from the victims themselves. Every shred of documentation you can get. I'll get it for you. BRAD: Okay. Now, once I file the lawsuit, will we have 30 days to submit the affidavits. That's not much time. LARRY: Incoming. (LOUDLY) How's the show going? LARRY: Just great. Got the highest ratings in my time-slot. Excellent. Go ahead and file a suit. (CHOPPER BLADES WHIRRING) (INMATE COUGHING) Oh. GUARD: Good, stay in line. INMATE: Get it done. Uh-huh. GUARD: Let's go Wallace, hurry it up. (INMATE WHIMPERS) GUARD: Let's go, keep it moving. (COUGHS) INMATE: Mmm-hmm. (COUGHS) INMATE: I'm just trying that's all. That meth was good. You know, you're real stupid? I got a good thing going here, and I'm not going to screw it up. (WHISPERING) Angie! I can help. Just give me the chance. (SCOFFS) No. See... You're the one that needs some help. INMATE: Who set it up? Boo! Jesus. Sexual abuse by the guards. What's this all about? Does that say who filed the lawsuit? Jane Doe. (ED SCOFFS) Ah, it's just somebody trying to make waves. I'm sure it's nothing, sir. Damn well better be nothing. (INAUDIBLE) That lawsuit don't mean jack unless she's got the proof. So what do we do now? Don't let her get the proof! You two keep an eye on Schaffer. You watch every move she makes. You don't let her out of your sight. (EXHALES) Well, get the hell out of here. STU: Yes, sir. (THUDS) LARRY: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Larry Schaffer Show. Tonight, we're going to be talking about women's prisons. Specifically... Our topic will be about the treatment of female inmates. Is there any chance for rehabilitation? Is there sexual abuse in the prison system? What about the female prisoners who get pregnant after they have been incarcerated? Listen everybody! (SHUSHING) LARRY: (OVER RADIO) We have our first caller on the air... Caller? You there? INMATE: Listen up. MAN: (ON RADIO) Yeah, Larry, is that you? LARRY: (OVER RADIO) Yeah, you're on the air. CALLER: Larry, look, I just got one thing to say... These women are in there because they're criminals, and they deserve whatever happens. LARRY: (OVER RADIO) But these are people we're talking about here, yes? CALLER: Yeah, well... LARRY: (OVER RADIO) Women who are in prison for a variety of reasons. CALLER: Yeah. LARRY: Shouldn't they be rehabilitated? You know, not raped. CALLER: Yeah, if they acted like human beings in the first place, they wouldn't be in there. And I'm sure as hell not going to believe anything they have to say. LARRY: Are you in law enforcement? (SWITCHES OFF RADIO) INMATE: Hey, who... Lights out, ladies. (INMATES MUMBLING) INMATE: We still got 10 minutes. WOMAN 2: Yeah. (INMATES EXCLAIMING IN AGREEMENT) INMATE 3: Ten more minutes! (GROANING) I said, lights out. (INMATES MURMURING) GUARD: Single file and keep it down. CARLA: Excuse me? Excuse me? I said, I need a sanitary napkin. (SIGHS) CARLA: You can hear me. Don't pretend you can't. (SOFTLY) Dennis? Come on, I've been waiting here a long time. Please don't make me beg. (LOUDLY) Hey, Dennis! She's been standing here forever. What's the matter, you got PMS too? (SCOFFS) She needs a sanitary napkin, give it to her! She can wait. She can't wait! Behind your line! She needs it now! Get back behind the line! You need some... (INMATES EXCLAIMING) DENNIS: I got it... Why you come here? Take it. LYNN: Here. Do it. INMATE: Now, girl! (ALL CLAMORING) DENNIS: Go on, get over... (ALARM RINGING) (CLAMORING CONTINUES) Calm down, Lynn. The show's over. Go back to what you were doing. Now. (THUDDING) (INMATE GASPS) Throw her in lock-down. Twenty-four hours. Unless you want to make it more. Go ahead. Clean this mess up. That's right. That's what I call one gutsy broad? INMATE: Welcome back to hell. All right, Schaffer. Hey, go on. (INMATES MURMURING INDISTINCTLY) (SCOFFS) INMATE: Way to go, Schaffer. (CHUCKLES) (WHISPERS) Oh, God. Ah. (SIGHS) (EXHALES) INMATE: No, okay, you can do it. Now, come on. INMATE: Hey, your turn. INMATE: Put me down for the next one. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) You know anything about this earring? Why don't you ask Angie? She's got another one just like it. (EXHALES) Angie's not talking. Every Tuesday night, the van leaves with our dirty laundry. Every Wednesday morning, comes back with clean clothes. (GUARD TALKING INDISTINCTLY) It's not the only thing on the truck. INMATE: Hey, what are you doing? How's your daughter? (CHUCKLES) Prom's coming up. She wants a new dress. Like I got the cash. (INMATE LAUGHING) (INMATE GRUNTS) GUARD: I told them I'd come in at 4:00... (GUARDS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) GUARD: Oh, no, come on. DENNIS: You all loaded? Yes, sir. Well, get out of there then. Come on, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move. Lock it up. Let's go. Yes, sir. GUARD: Come on, let's go. In the truck. Don't. All right, all right. Lock it up. (ENGINE STARTING) (TIRES SQUEALING) Okay, girls, you know the drill. (SNAPPING FINGERS) (INMATE WHOOPING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (SIGHS) (CAR APPROACHING) Here they come. ANGIE: Here we go. It's show time. Okay, ladies, step right up. ANGIE: Good evening, gentlemen. ED: Gentlemen, they're all yours. Did you bring me candy? Come on, honey. ANGIE: Hi! Here you go. Thank you. Have a good night. Yeah. Money. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Ed's got a prostitution ring going with Stu and Dennis. They put the inmates in the laundry truck. You know, I knew something was going on. (WHISPERING INAUDIBLY) Okay, make sure your computers are turned off and take your notes with you to study. (CLICKS TONGUE) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Honey, throw me your shoes or you'll get sand in them. Daddy says my feet are almost as big as yours. (CHUCKLES) I doubt that! Try 'em on. That's okay. They are big. CAREY: Can I try yours on? No! Please. Oh. Okay. Just don't get sand in them. LYNN: Here you go. Okay. Hey, Dad! Hmm? They almost fit. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yes, indeed they do. (LAUGHS) Larry, take them off her before she hurts herself. Yeah, or hurts me. LARRY: This one first. LYNN: You okay, sweetie? You okay? Mmm-hmm. Hmm, good. Okay. LYNN: Did it hurt? CAREY: A little bit. Your ankles swell. LARRY: Here you are. STU: Hold it. LARRY: Excuse me. LYNN: So, Carey, what's new at school? CAREY: Only two more weeks till summer vacation. LYNN: You and Sara can have sleep-overs, huh? CAREY: Yeah, I know! (GASPS) They are onto you. What do you care? I want to give you some advice... You be real careful. You really wanna help? Tell me where you were last night. Write it all down and sign it. What are you going to do with it? I'll worry about that. You just write it. Just cover your butt or you'll catch cold. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO) LARRY: ...horrible conditions at the Delory Women's correctional facility. The female inmates... Hey, shut up and listen. ...razor wire inventory... Hey, that's Schaffer's old man. ...prison are suffering abuse, ladies and gentlemen. And not at the hands of each other but by the correctional officers who work there. Sexual abuse, in exchange for gifts, such as phone privileges... Mmm. ...or even drugs. The inmates are forced to perform sexual acts. Rape, ladies and gentlemen. That's called "Rape." Today, we are going to be taking some calls, and all the callers are either ex-inmates of DWCF, or are on parole. First caller. You there? FEMALE CALLER: Hi, Larry. LARRY: Now, you spent some time out at the Delory facility. Is that right? FEMALE CALLER: Yes. Seven years. And everything you said is true. Even worse. LARRY: And did you ever actually see any of the coerced sexual activity between a female inmate and a prison guard? FEMALE CALLER: See it, like first hand. LARRY: So, are you saying... The hell is going on? I thought you said, there was no truth to this. There isn't. This is nothing but a disgruntled husband filing a lawsuit, trying to make us out to be the bad guys. Well, clear it up. (DOOR OPENING) (SHATTERING) SPOKESPERSON: We've done our own investigation and it's clear that there have not been any cases of sexual abuse at the DWCA. (PHONE RINGING) Well, what about the lawsuit that's been filed? My feelings go out to the person who filed this. LARRY: (ON PHONE) Hello. BRAD: I guess I don't have to tell you to turn on your TV. LARRY: Yeah, I'm watching it. I need those affidavits, Larry. (SIGHS) (GASPS) Do me a favor? I got to go make the rounds. And I'll be back in about 10 minutes? Sure. What? Can you put these files back in the cabinet for me? No problem. Ten minutes. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) CARLA: So, how's Prom? Fun. Yeah? What'd you do? I went with this really cool guy. Oh, yeah, you were telling me about him. JULIE: Yeah, he's really like cute. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Where's my wife? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Schaffer, I thought you knew. Your wife's visiting privileges have been revoked. LARRY: What the hell for? Fermenting prison unrest. You son of a bitch, if you have done anything... CARLA: Mr. Schaffer? Uh, I wanted to thank you. The money for my daughter's dress? You're welcome. How sweet. She's okay. He... Lynn's okay. (SIGHING) (SNIFFLING) Everything better be like you said, Crang. Everything is fine, sir. Good. 'Cause I just got a phone call from Senator Greene. She's coming through here tomorrow. Just to check this out. Hmm. The senator will find everything in order, sir. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) I can make it stop, Frannie. But I need you to connect the motel for me. And I need it by tomorrow. (KEYS JANGLING) Good morning, Sergeant Crang. "And then he saw where it was that she had been, "the scattered meadows of the seaboard..." And then I looked right at him and I spit in his face. (CHUCKLES) And then, um... I don't... I don't remember what happened next. Harriet? You dropped your napkin. (PAPER RUSTLES) (DIALING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? They're after Carey. Go get her now, don't let her... (GASPS) God, no... (WHIMPERS) (DOOR OPENS) (GROANS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Marla? Hi, I'm sorry, something has come up, Carey. I need to take her out for the day. I'm sure she'll be back tomorrow. Oh... Every bed. Every locker. Look everywhere, damn it. Those files are somewhere in this building and I want you people to find them. Dennis, you start down the far end. Sheila, you stay with the girls. Come on. Let's go. Move it! (INDISTINCT MURMURING) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) What the hell is going on in here? Shake-down, sir. The Senator is on her way. Clean this mess up. Now. You heard the warden. Clean it up. (SCREAMS) Schaffer's in lock-down, fermenting prison unrest. I understand, Warden Steward, but I would like to hear her side. Sheila, unlock the door. Sheila. Mrs. Schaffer? Yeah. I'm Senator Greene. I've heard your husband's broadcasts, and I've read about your story in the papers, I'd like to talk with you. (CLEARS THROAT) Right, yeah. Um... Thank you, you know, for your concern and everything but, um... God, I really just don't have anything to say. Perhaps, you'd rather speak with me alone. All those reports are attributed to you. ANGIE: No, no... There's nothing to say. Uh... I was wrong. You know, it's... It's not true. I see. Maybe, some other time, Mrs. Schaffer. (EXHALES) Show me the rest. Of course. What was that about? You told me to clean it up. I did. Senator Greene's here. ED: Schaffer! (PANTING) (DOOR OPENS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) The affidavits, Sam's block. (INMATES CHEERING) CARLA: Oh, damn. ED: Get out of my way. Get out of my way! (INDISTINCT CLAMORING) Here they are. Carla, I have them. I have them. Get her! DENNIS: She's got it. Get her. Quick. Stop her. (SIGHS) Hand them over, Harriet. ED: Hand 'em over. They're blank. Keep them here! DENNIS: Yes, sir. Run! ALL: Run. Back up. Everyone back up. Back up! LYNN: Senator Greene. (INAUDIBLE) ED: (COCKS GUN) Hold it right there, Schaffer. (COCKS GUN) Put the gun down, Ed. Schaffer? Lynn Schaffer? It was a mix-up. You ought to take a look at these affidavits. (PANTING) Thank you, Mrs. Schaffer. Let's go. In my office, Crang. Now. WARDEN: Furlough papers. Sign it and you can spend the rest of your sentence at home. You'll have to be in every evening by 9:00 p.m. But other than that, you're free. Until my appeal. Then, I'll be free. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (CHEERING AND WHISTLING) (CHUCKLES) I'm going to miss you. (INMATES LAUGHING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) (CAMERA CLICKING) (REPORTERS CLAMORING) FEMALE REPORTER: What are you going to do now? Lynn. Lynn! We're gonna miss you. We'll miss you a lot.
