Sorry >Initially, this was a plan to follow an idol campaign project. However, the program was never broadcast. >Mr. Kani, I'm sorry, but I heard that you've put together a project for a media strategy using idols >and I was wondering if you could tell me what that is? >I'm just doing my routine work of working with idols. >Since it's a product campaign and a project promotion at the same time, we can expect a wide range of effects. >I'm going to leave it here from overseas, so you'll have to wait and see. >Good morning! >And now that you're all here, we've had an impromptu meeting the other day. >This is Emi Kato's campaign. We're going to be working on a more concrete concept for the project >And we're hoping to get it to that point today. >I'm thinking about it, but it's a little bit sudden, so I'd like to ask Ms. Umehara to explain the details. >I'm sorry for the inconvenience this may cause you, but I'm going to leave the music to Mr. Yamagishi. >We've already reached a consensus on the client, and it's a very good thing for Emi. >But yes, idols are idols, and I think we've been unable to clearly define what we mean by idols >We would like to push the character a little more, but we are not sure how much we can do >We'd like to make the costumes more creative rather than just cute >If we're going to make some changes to the costumes, then I'd like to do something different from the past ones. >I'd like to make a big effort so we don't lose the cuteness of Emi's image. >I want to go back to the basics and make her bigger >She still has a lot of potential, and she's a talented person >I'd like to get back to the basics so we can work harder >The song is called "Lovecraft. >Well, the concept with the makers hasn't changed, but I think it's a little too adult for this director >I'm quite motivated by the interesting eyes >But you know what they say, I've been writing lyrics for a while now >It's a little different from what I've written before, so it's challenging >I don't know if I can match it, but, you know, your thing, your arrangement... >I'm thinking of going with the Minneapolis style >huh? >Minneapolis >I'm sorry, I'd like to ask you a few questions, are you happy to hear more? >I heard that you are the author of Emi's song this time. >How does this relate to the campaign itself? >We needed to understand the nature of the product, and the agency's copywriters had to come up with a number of ideas for the product. >The agency's copywriters would come to us with a number of suggestions, and we would make our selections in the form of proposals. >To put it simply, first of all, it's our job to develop Emi's image >So, how is the songwriting process going to go, since we're composing the music first and the lyrics later? >Well, it happens quite often, and I don't think there's anything wrong with it. >Is it okay don't have a meeting with the person who wrote the music? >I think it's fine if you don't have a meeting with the person who composed the music. >As Mr. Yamagishi mentioned earlier, we can't clearly say who composed the music, so this is also a bit of a problem. >I've been making my debut for two years now, and this will be my fourth single. >Every time I release a new song, I go to a record store and say hello. >And they put up posters and stuff like that. >When I'm there, they play my songs and stuff, but as soon as I go, they put other people's songs. >Emi is currently undergoing voice training. >Shuichi Honda - Voice trainer >Emi is currently undergoing voice training, and she's going to use her voice in a different way for this new song. >So she's working on the basics of voice development. >Let's talk to Mr. Honda, our voice trainer. >In Emi's case, it's been one year since her debut,but she's been working on her lyrics ever since her debut. >I think that most of the students who come to us are newcomers. >She's working very hard on her singing. >There are all kinds of people, but for example, I hate to say this, but there are rock singers and people who sing in their own style >There are people who sing three or four songs in a row, you know. >If you sing three or four songs in a row, your throat cracks, and you lose your voice, or something like that. >In her case, she still has a long way to go. She has a throat that can grow more and more >She's been working hard on her voice training. >So, good luck with your voice training. >This is where Mr.Aida, the arranger of Emi's new song, is working, and I'd like to talk to him for a moment. >I'm sorry to interrupt your work, but what are you working on right now? >we're working on Emi Kato's song >Karaoke? but...I don't see anyone in the band >The computer memorizes the sounds you play and arranges them to make a song. >The music has a little bit of a strange melody, you know? >I'm going to make a modern rhythm to match Emi Kato's character. >Who composed this song?

On the mother's face there's with a sad expression >Well, in a ghost photo, if you look at a tree trunk, you can see a person's face screaming >Or if you look at a stain, it looks like something, depending on how you look at it >It's the way the person perceives it, but this is a baby. and the mother is holding her baby like this. >There are a lot of scary and unexplained stories out there. >My pores are standing up, very scary moment. Believe it or not, it's your choice. >Emi, I'm going one more time. >Hey, Hey. Emi, behind you! >What's wrong with you? >Thank you very much, thank you for your time! How do you feel now that you're done singing? >It's not so bad. It's an interesting song. >I like this song very much because the lyricist is a woman, right? >The lyrics are written by a woman, so it's very cute and expresses a girl's feelings very well. >The mix-down process of the recorded songs is now underway. >The songs and performances that were recorded separately are now being put together. >I hear a strange sound in the chorus, so I'm going to try to change it back a little bit. >Stop it! >Telephone interview with Mr.Kasai >So we're going to continue with the interview, and we look forward to working with you, and we'd love to interview the composer as well, >I'm not in contact with the composer yet >June,7, 1988. 4:00 P.m >I'd like to introduce you to the composer of the song. >Well, a few years ago, our label had an open call for songs in a magazine. I think she came to us at that time. >I think it was an honorable mention, but I liked it. and since it was urgent, we thought we'd could it. >The composer of "Lovecraft" is unknown. Was. The interview staff raised the suspicion to Mr.Kasai >I'll let you know when I hear from them. >This is the magazine that announced the contest in which the original "Lovecraft" song was submitted. >But I couldn't find the song anywhere in the magazine. >So, there seems to be a lot of mystery surrounding this campaign project, and that's why we're trying to figure out what's going on. >So we decided to deviate from our original theme and pursue the idols of the entertainment industry from a slightly different perspective. >Good morning, I've just decided on the version of the promotion >I think it's more important to have a visual strategy, right? I wonder if it's inspired by the lyrics of Mr. Awashima's song. >Of course there's that, and then there's the fact that we didn't take the time to boil it all down, you know. >So here is the issue that Mr.Yamagishi mentioned the other day, but I can't find the song that corresponds to it anywhere in this issue >No, no, I'm sure that song was submitted for this issue. >Kasai did not give a clear answer >And the idol industry itself, in that sense, is also very much about the mass production of more and more idols, and the money that goes with it. >Terumi Yoshida - Personality >If we just mass-produce more and more idols and make more and more money, it's going to be difficult. >I think we are approaching a difficult point. >I think it's a little bit out of the question, but, you know, in the past, there have been some award-winning works by singer-songwriters >And then there was also the story that a certain work was taken from a famous person, or plagiarized, or something like that. >I'm not sure how many people in the industry are unaware of such things, even though I'm in the industry myself. >I have a feeling that there are some strange things in the idol industry that even people in the industry are surprised by. >I would like to ask you if you know anything about,,, >I'd love to hear from you. >Hi,Hello who is it? >This is Sawaki. >Telephone interview with Mr.Yamagishi >Thank you very much.

In them strange identical events were recorded. >Look, there's a woman in the picture here. >And here, you see the woman >And then there's more. >Don't tell me that's the composer. >The interview staff was finally able to locate the composer of "Lovecraft" >However, she commited suicide seven years ago. >Ogikubo, Tokyo >The composer of the original song jumped off this spot seven years ago and killed herself. >I wonder why producer Kawanishi decided to use her song now. >The interview staff obtained a demo tape that seems to be the original "Lovecraft" >Hi, I'm Emi Kato, and I'm about to shoot my promotional video >I've changed my image and I'm going to be more mature and more broad-minded. >I'm going to do my best to become a more mature and cool idol. >And please also check out my new song "Lovecraft"! >Okay, so it's on the far right, it's on the far left, it's set up on the left. >Behind me right now, there's a rehearsal going on for Emi Kato's promotional video today. >The video, which will be shot and available for sale, is part of a larger media strategy for this campaign project. >Wait a minute, Kyoko >Light! >After this, the reporter Kyoko Sawaki was hospitalized for a month. >I noticed a strange image on the videotape. It's an aimless edit. >There's no evidence that it was put in the camera and when you play it... >A voice was recorded with noise for the first 6 minutes >For the next 14 minutes, intermittent but incomprehensible images were recorded. >The following scene is a re-edited version of this strange image added to the footage shot by the interview staff. >Help...me >Why didn't you tell the management that you were pregnant? >All this stuff, all these things you do to say hello to me, it's not impressive. >Sure, sure, that song is yours,I know it. >Your child is not under your control. >Go quietly, quietly, quietly to home >Whose point of view was this? >JAGANREI >I'm Haruo Mizuno. >I work in various fields on the picture industry, and even in the film industry, I've heard of all kinds of psychic phenomena >Haruo Mizuno - Film critic >I'm not saying that I've experienced them myself, but... there's a movie called Poltergeist, and they're currently making the third movie in the series. >There is a legend that every time they make a new film, people involved in it die, and the cause of their death is unknown. >I'm very sorry to say this from my own experience, but I've been talking about Hollywood for more than ten years now. >I was in Hollywood for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I happened to stay at a hotel in the area where all the Hollywood studios are located. >I was very tired in Los Angeles, So I decided to find a place where I could walk to the studio. >I found a small hotel on the far side of Hollywood Street. >I was resting there and in the middle of the night, I heard lot of noise, a lot of noise, and I was wondering what it was. >I opened the curtains to see if there was some strange car driving by, and found that there were no cars on the road. it's not a street where cars go. >I turned on the TV to see if there might be some confidence or other reports of such things, too. but there was no such report. >I thought it was weird... and then I went back to sleep. >I went to a studio the next day and was shown around the place. I saw a man who had a very good reputation the and I asked him why they don't shoot movies there. >And he told me that whenever they shoot a movie here, some kind of accident always happens, and that's why they hardly use it. >I heard that there is a cemetery behind the studio, where famous stars and famous people in the movie industry are buried. >I had the impression at the time that the stage was built on top of it. >So, looking back, I wonder if what I experienced last night was a poltergeist phenomenon. >And I was horrified once again. >I myself am a very strong believer in such things. I was surprised at the first time I had such an experience. >I was surprised that there were no strong example of such an attack, but I was working at the cutting edge of science in film, and at the same time I was working on the periphery. >I am reminded of the fact that there are many things that cannot be explained in the world of film >Good afternoon. >Subs by: Fernando Menegatti
