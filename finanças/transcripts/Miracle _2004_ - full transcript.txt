And in other news tonight, a constitutional amendment which would allow 18 year olds to vote in all elections cleared the congress and headed for the white house this afternoon. President Nixon has given every indication that he will soon sign the amendment into law. This is not an invasion of Cambodia. And as the increasingly powerful Soviet military displayed its arsenal at this year's may day parade, the state department reaffirmed that the Cold War is as cold as ever. The Soviets take the ball in. It's a crosscourt pass to Belov! He's got it! He's up! He scores! And the Soviets win the gold over the United States! Because people have got to know whether or not their President's a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. The secret behind today's modern computer is the silicon chip. Some experts predict this modern marvel might one day impact our daily lives. This is homecoming day for Apollo 17, the last round trip to the moon that Americans may take in this century. That's right! Now anyone can turn their ordinary TV into a magic box of video games. Fun for the kids and... I, Gerald R. Ford, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute, that I will faithfully... We must whip inflation right now. What was being called "peace with honor" only a few short months ago has disintegrated into utter chaos as the US evacuated... OK, let's light this place up. Let's get on the dance floor. Come on, everybody, now. The streaking craze continues to take the nation by storm as college students across the country are shedding their clothes. Aah! Aah! Aah! Happy 200th birthday, America, and many, many more! That I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States. The office of the President of the United States. Billy Beer hit the shelves this week. The White House has declined to comment on the latest business venture of President Carter's brother. And as President Carter issued the order prohibiting the purchase of Iranian oil, Americans again find themselves in long gas lines, dealing with another oil crisis. Governor Brown, implementing emergency regulations, reviewed his plan for gas rationing based on... Funeral arrangements for rock singer Elvis Presley have not yet been announced. The entertainer died Tuesday in Memphis from what doctors called cardiac arrhythmia. Breaker 1-8 northbound. Over. Mr. Carter approved emergency financial aid for the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls, New York. That area is in a state of crisis because of chemical leakage in the landfill on which it's built. Authorities here are saying that there's been an uncontrolled release of radiation from the Three Mile Island nuclear facility, but details are still unclear. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. USA Hockey. Please hold. USA Hockey. He's just stepping into a meeting. When's... OK, when's the best time to reach you? He's got your number? OK. - Herb... - Hey, Walter. - How we doing? - Good to see you. How was the flight? - Oh, not bad. - Well, that's great. Everybody's waiting to see us. Who all's here? Oh, just Money--money, who's got a say in this thing. Bob Fleming, the International Council, USA Hockey. Lou Nanne, I think you know, from the NHL... The only way we can compete with the eastern bloc teams is if we're willing to change. Change what? Change the way we train, the way we prepare, even change our schedule. Now, what kind of scheduling changes are we talking about, Herb? I think we need to make it longer, you know. Tougher. Much more competitive. Longer? You gonna pay for that? We, uh, we also need to change the way we play the game. What exactly does that mean? My plan is to adopt a new style. A hybrid of the Soviet School and the Canadian School. A combination that requires the highest level of conditioning, speed, creativity... And most of all, team chemistry. Is this what you've been using at the University of Minnesota? Well, we've been phasing it in over the last couple of years, yeah. - But this is-- - He has won three NCAA titles, fellas. Walter, we don't have years. We have months. Herb, you actually think you can take a bunch of kids who've never played together and teach them a whole new style of play in the time we have? OK, look, here's the North American style. What if these kids can't pick it up fast enough? Now, we all know we're a long shot for a medal, but we don't want to get embarrassed either. - That's right. - That's right. Bob, four years ago, our Olympic team lost to the Czech B team. I think it was 15-1, you know. In all due respect, I don't think we can embarrass ourselves any more than that. That's assuming they don't go pro. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd have a hard time giving up good money to finish sixth at Lake Placid. It's a tough draw, Herb. Tough draw. It's a tough draw even if we don't play the Soviets. - What the hell happens if we do? - Well, that's-- We put our best on the ice with them last year. Professional all-stars. They still beat us. It wasn't because you weren't good enough. All-star teams fail because they rely solely on the individual's talent. The Soviets win because they take that talent and they use it inside a system that's designed for the betterment of the team. My goal is to beat them at their own game. Beat the best team in the world? Gold medalists in '64, '68, '72, '76? That's a pretty lofty goal, Herb. Lou, that's... that's why I want to pursue it. Well, fellas... Any more questions? - I'm good. - No? That's it for me. Thanks very much. It's good seeing you. - Herb, thanks. - All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Herb. Appreciate it. Hey. It's coming down out there. Hey, where are the kids? Oh, I gave them away. How'd it go? Ah, I'm not their guy. You know, the only reason they had me come out there was because two other coaches already said no. I think they're still looking East Coast. What--what's that? - It's a costume party, Herb. - No, Patti. Come on. Nick and Nora Charles, The Thin Man. - You're gonna make me wear this? - Oh, yes. They're sophisticated, they're dashing, they're debonair. I've got a mustache for you. - No, Patti. - And a little dog for me. ♪ You can leave ♪ ♪ You can go ♪ ♪ 'Cause you know I love you so ♪ Excuse me. ♪ But you can suit suit ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Baby, you can suit yourself... ♪ Oh, Linda, can you get that for me? Oh, sure. Hello? Yes, just a moment, please. Patti, it's for Herb. Someone from the USOC. - Uh-oh! - It's 8-0! All right, it's gonna be a dramatic comeback. Hmm. Go. - Herb... - Yeah? Herb. You've got a call from Colorado. We're not done here. Yes, well, so then he what? He just-- he went along with that or... Well, I appreciate that, Walter. Thank you. What'd they say? I got the job. - Herb! - I got the job. How about that, huh? - Oh, great! Oh! - Huh? - When do you start? - Two weeks. Two weeks? They want you to start that soon? Well, the games are in February, so... Yeah, but it's June. Is there even ice? - Mommy! Mommy, mommy. - Oh. You know, we're supposed to take the kids to the Black Hills. Yeah, I know. I know, I know. Cleopatra's leaving, and she wants to say goodbye to you. OK. OK. I gotta call Craig Patrick right now. - Hey, Buzz. - Hey. What's going on? - How are you doing? - Good. - Phil Verchota. - Verchota? Name? Ralph Cox, UNH. Name, please. - Mike Ramsey. - Hi, Mike. Number, towel. Jack O'Callahan, right? - Last time I checked. - Good luck, Jack. - Thanks, buddy. - Who's next? Jimmy Craig. Hey, Jack. What's up, you sieve? - How's it going? - Good. Is there a reason why Joey Mullen's not here? Yeah, about 30,000 of them, all sitting in his New York bank account. He got a $30,000 signing bonus? - Crazy, isn't it? - Yeah. How's it looking? A lot of guys from Minnesota and Boston. Yeah, that's gonna work. You're Robbie McLanahan, right? Yeah. Mike Eruzione. Boston University. - Seventy-six. - Seventy-six. Try to play for Brooks a little more, huh? I played for him for four years. A few more months wouldn't hurt. How about you? Just trying to play a little more hockey, that's all. Rest of your boys all here? Of course. Think they'd miss out on this? Might want to wait a day or so before you go over and say hi. Check! Come on, hit those lines! Head for the net! The net! Come on, come on! Skate, boys! Skate! Skate! Drop your shoulder! On the wing! Hey, go to the blue line! Man, look at that move. Whoo, Rizzo! Eruzione? Cross him off the list, Walter. Kid doesn't have a shot in hell of making this team. You think so? No way. One more! Do it again! Pucks in, pucks in! Forward! Blue line! So, doc cleared him. Says it's just a sprain. Good. Hey, Herb, I just wanted to let you know how much I'm looking forward to being able to coach with you. You were a hell of a player, Craig. And you're gonna make a hell of a coach. Thanks. I'm gonna need you to stick tight with these kids. If there's any big problems, you'll let me know about it. Otherwise, you take care of it, OK? OK. Take a look at that. What's this? Twenty-six names. And the tough part will be getting it down to 20 before the opening ceremonies. What, this is the final roster? Y-you're kidding me, right? This is our first day, Herb. I mean, we got a week of this. What about the advisory staff? Aren't they supposed to have a say in this? Uh, technically, I guess. I don't know. Well, you're-you're missing some of the best players. I'm not looking for the best players, Craig. I'm looking for the right ones. You have Jim Craig to back up Janaszak? Other way around. Other way around? I'm sorry, didn't Janaszak just win you a national championship? Jannie is a solid goaltender, but we're not playing for the National Championship here, Craig. You know, people I speak to say Craig's game has been off since his mom died. Did they ever see him when his game's on? Hughes. Ross. Auge. Delich. Horsch. Strobel. Christoff. Morrow. Suter. Ramsey. Janaszak. Christian. Pavelich. Verchota. Baker. Harrington. Schneider. O'Callahan. McClanahan. Silk. Johnson. Craig. Cox. Eruzione. And that's the roster for now. Rest of you, thanks for coming out. - Congratulations. - Congratulations, Robbie. Way to go, Rizzo. Take a good look, gentlemen... 'Cause they're the ones getting off easy. We're putting a few of you on reserve in case somebody gets injured or their game goes to hell. The final roster will have 20 names on it in seven months, so more of you are going home. You give 99 %, you'll make my job very, very easy. I'll be your coach. I won't be your friend. If you need one of those, take it up with doc or coach Patrick here. God... All right, gentlemen. Congratulations to all of you. That's it for today. On the way out, pick up one of these. You've got a little homework to do... before you celebrate. Thank you. Whoo! Herb! Herb. Hold on a minute. Hey, Walter. How we doing? I think we got a problem here, Herb. What's that? I got a roomful of people up there who want to have a say in this process, and you've already picked the team. - Look, Walter-- - No, no. Now, there's a right way to do this kind of thing, and this is not it. And I know you got a job to do. And if I was in your shoes, I'd probably be saying the same thing. All right, then. Let's go upstairs. We'll help piece together a hockey team. All of us, together. Walter, that's just not gonna happen. Do you realize what the AAHA went through to put this thing together? The best amateur players in the country on the ice for a week? - Yeah. - Not just a day. And I didn't ask for that, because I already know my team. How do you know your team? Those kids haven't been on the ice for, what-- maybe a couple of hours. Walter, every one of those boys was chosen for a specific reason. I've studied film on each and every one of those boys. I've seen them, I've watched them, and I've coached a lot of them. And the ones I haven't, I've spoken with their coaches and scouts in the area. Now, I know best what I need to compete. And the team I've chosen is it. What am I supposed to say to the advisory board, the committee? Tell them the truth. This puts me in a hell of a spot, Herb. A hell of a spot! Well, they hired me to do a job. I'm trying to do it. All right. I'm gonna back you on this. But I sure as hell hope you know what you're doing. I'm not waiting. Sometimes. Hey, Phillie, what are you on? My test is done. Jesus! Me and Jannie are done. - Verchota, you're done? - Yeah. I'm on page four. "You get stopped by a policeman, but you know you're not at fault. Do you state your disagreement right away?" He's got 300 of these things. It's just a test, Silky. You've taken one or two before. Not to play hockey, I haven't. Can you even read, Silky? I try. Hey, Rizzo! - What's going on? - Mac. Easy, big guy. You know, I don't know how you two can sit in the same room with that clown. Let it go. It's over. Let it go. What's going on here? OC's got a little unfinished business over there. - Not for long I don't. - Hey, what did I tell you, man? McClanahan? You're not still going on about the '76 playoffs, are you? Oh, come on, OC, you know, that was, like, three years ago. You know what, Coxie, let me ask you a question. Why did you want to play college hockey? Isn't it obvious? For the-- for the girls. I'm serious, Coxie. Why did you want to play college hockey? 'Cause I love to play hockey, all right? I w-want to go to the NHL just like everybody does. Well, I wanted to win a national championship. That pansy over there cheap-shots me. I get tossed out of the game. He steals the ring right off my finger? How would you feel? Everyone was throwing cheap shots that night. You know, Rizzo, it's funny you say that. 'Cause I was just wondering what side you're on. I'm on your side. You know, it really seems that way. All right, just relax, OK? Jeez. I'm not doing this right now. I'm outta here. Where you going? To my room. Is that all right with you... Mother? Just let him go. Well, you know, no wonder the guy gets so many penalty minutes, right? He gets a little carried away sometimes. That's it. Pick it up. That's it. Kick it out! Look for the pass. Come on, hit him with a pass. - Go, Johnson! - Outside! All right, Johnson, hit him on the other side. Get them up! Look for him! Move and hit him, Johnson. He's open. - Center, center! - Come on, Johnson! Johnson! That coast-to-coast stuff may work here, but it won't against the teams we'll be playing. OK. Next line up. Let's go. Let's run it again. Morrow... Let me take this one. Don't worry about it, all right? Keep your head up. This is a breakout play, gentlemen. So, please, let's get rid of the puck early. All right, let's go! Hey, hey! - Oh! - Oh, my god. - What's OC doing? - That was cheap. He didn't have the puck. What the hell are you hitting like that for, man? That's bush league, OC. Nice hit, OC. Tell your boy here to keep his head up, and he won't have to worry about it. You all right, man? Let's go! Craig... let them go. You got him? - Hey, stay on him! - Stay out of it, Buzzy! Get him, OC. Come on, give it to him. - What are you doing? - Stay out of it, Baker! - Get him, OC. - Come on, give it to him. Give it to him! All right, Mac. Come on, Mac. Take him down! Come on, OC! Let him have it! - Put him on the ice! - Come on, OC. Come on. There you go. Beat him, OC. - Oh! - Oh, man! Whoa! That's it. Well, how about it, boys? Look like hockey to you? Looks more like a couple of monkeys trying to hump a football to me, I don't know. What do you think, Craig? Yeah. You want to settle old scores, you're on the wrong team. We move forward starting right now. We start becoming a team right now! Skating... passing. Flow... creativity. That is what this team is all about, gentlemen. Not old rivalries. So, why don't we start with some introductions? You know, get to know each other a little bit. Where you're from, who you are, you know. Go ahead. Rob McClanahan. St. Paul, Minnesota. Who you play for? For you, here at the U. Jack? Jack O'Callahan. Charlestown, Mass. Boston University. Over here. - Yeah. - Uh... I'm Ralph Cox. I'm from wherever's not gonna get me hit. yeah. Very good. Everybody on the line. Let's go. ♪ Must of got lost ♪ ♪ Must of got lost ♪ - Hey, Jim. - Hey, coach. Been wondering why you wouldn't take this test. Yeah. Well... It's nothing against you or anything. I just don't see what it has to do with stopping a puck. Well, that's all right. You just took it anyway. ♪ Honey, I Don't Know ♪ Hey, coach... - So, if I took it-- - You know, I meant to ask you... How's your family doing? Doing all right. And you? I'm OK. You know, I got 26 guys trying to make this team, Jim. Only 20 are gonna go to Lake Placid. So I gotta know how committed you are to being here. Because if you're not... You're just wasting our time. Look, coach... My dad's going through a rough time right now. He's got nothing. He lost his job, and with Atlanta trying to sign me... Bottom line is, my, um, my mom wanted this... Me playing on this team. Hard to say no to someone who drove you to practice every day, right? You didn't answer my question, Jim. I'm here, aren't I? I'll see you in the morning. Don't forget to bring your game. The Soviets performed a nuclear test yesterday, setting off a 75-kiloton bomb in Eastern Kazakhstan. Eh... So much hate and fear. - What's that? - Between the Soviets and the West. They have all these nuclear weapons pointed at each other. It's bound to end in disaster. Oh, come on. They'll figure something out, doc. Don't got any other choice, right? Well, yeah, hope so. But it just seems to me that there are some people who never get along. - And that's the news. Now more music. - Yeah. Like hockey players from Boston and Minnesota. Our own private cold war. Hey, doc, let me ask you a question, all right? Of course. You've worked with Herb for a long time, right? Oh, I've known Herb for quite some time. So tell me something... Does he always... treat his players like this? No. No, no. This I have never seen. But, no-- but, Craig, believe me, Herb has a reason for everything he does. Well, he's ending up with 20 players who hate his guts. I don't know, maybe if they hate him, they won't have time to hate each other. ♪ ...Out on thunder island ♪ ♪ Doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo... ♪ Hey, honey. - How much longer you gonna be? - I still got a few more. - Well, I'm going to bed, OK? - OK. OK. Oh, you know, Kelly has ballet at 4:00 tomorrow and Danny's done with hockey camp at about the same time. Which one do you want to get? - Herb? - Yeah. Can you pick up Danny at four o'clock? Well, we got team meetings after practice tomorrow. Well, I can't be in two places at one time. Well, what about Margie? I thought she was all set-- - They're on vacation. - Well, I don't know, honey. You'll figure it out. Can you turn that off, please? Please. Herb, this is what happens over the summer. The kids are off doing a zillion different things, and every once in a while, your meetings are gonna have to wait. - Come on, Patti. - Well... I'm coaching a hockey team here. I mean, this is-- you know, we already talked about this. Oh, really? W-when exactly did we have this talk? Because I don't recall being a part of the conversation. What did I say? Was it interesting? We never had this talk. Never. OK, what's on your mind? Nothing. No, you're obviously mad about something. No, first you're upset because we didn't talk. And then when I try to talk about-- I don't know, whatever it is, you don't want to, so... You know, Patti, if you're not willing to-- Herb... It's not because we didn't talk. It's because you never even asked. I know what this is about. I know it, and you know it. What? Know what? This. What you're doing. Chasing after something you didn't get, that you may never get. What if it doesn't work out, Herb, huh? Are we gonna do this every four years? It's OK. Go finish your work. Go, go. Hey. Hey. you know... Ever since I stopped playing, I wanted to coach this team. And this is the only way I know how to do it. It's not the easiest way, I know, for you... or the kids. But... Patti, I have to do this. I know you do. I'm sorry we didn't talk. And I was wrong not to ask. So I'm asking now if you-- you know, if you can be with me on this, because... It won't mean anything if you're not. Blue line, back. Red line, back. Far blue line, back. Far red line, back. And you have 45 seconds to do it. Get used to this drill. We'll be doing it a lot. Why? Because the legs feed the wolf, gentlemen. I can't promise you we'll be the best team at Lake Placid next February. But we will be the best-conditioned. That I can promise you. Be prepared to grow through pain, gentlemen. You're gonna skate harder than you've ever skated in your lives every minute of every day you're on the ice with me. Stretch things out North and South, you open things up East and West. Center's gonna fill in here. This winger-- this far-side winger-- he's gonna come in here, take the center spot. - What's your name? - Mark Johnson. - Where you from, Mark? - Madison, Wisconsin. - Who you play for? - University of Wisconsin, coach. Come on, go, boys. Go, boys! The fastest way to make this team is by being fast! No, no! Stop. Look at you. Three men being covered by one guy. This isn't weaving for weaving's sake. Spread out! Use the ice! - Right there. - There? OK. Come on, Jimmy. Challenge them! You're getting beat on the side here, Jimmy. Challenge them. Yeah, I don't blame you. How you holding up? - Oh, no. - Not good, not good. - How about you? - Name's Christian. - Who do you play for? - University of North Dakota. Pass it! Come on! No! No, no, no! Get him to a point! You're quarterbacking this play! Come on, Rizzo, I got you running this play! I'll tell you what you're gonna run right now is the bench. Mac, get out here! Boom, he can hit him. Boom. Boom. Boom. We're opening up options, see? We've got four options off one play, guys. You guys got that? Anybody have any questions? OK, let's go. - What the hell is he talking about? - No clue. Twenty of you are going to Lake Placid. Six are going home. Who that is, believe it or not, is up to you. - How about you? - Mark Pavelich. - Who do you play for? - UMD Bulldogs. Let's go! Next line up! All right, turn it up, boys. Turn it up. Let's move it, bah. Get it up, get it up! Eric, it's open! Here you go, here you go, here you go! Whoo-hoo! They can't stop us yet. - Attaway, Buzzy. - Nice pass. That was a good shot. Uh... you three... - Run that again. - Again? - All right. Let's go. - Let's go. Christ, we don't have a chance in hell of winning. So I understand how you feel. - Don't let them know that, huh. - Yeah. - All right. - Thanks, coach. - So, the coneheads are coming in. - Who? That's what the guys have been calling them, you know, 'cause, uh, well, they're a little... You know, like the coneheads. W-what's that? Dan Akroyd, Jane Curtin... Uh... I guess it's off your radar. Come on in, boys. Wanted to see us, coach? Yeah, I'm, uh, thinking about keeping the three of you together on the same line. Everybody OK with that? - Yeah. Sure. - Yeah. Sure. How about you, Buzzy? You think this works with Bah and Pav here? Yeah, it's going good. Moving the puck well, uh... It's just a little different playing with them, you know. Yeah, I don't know how to explain it. We just seem to always find each other at the other end of the ice and make things happen. Yeah. Pass, shoot, score. Pass, shoot, and score. Well, all right. We'll see how she goes. - All right. Thanks, coach. - Thanks, coach. Take it easy. Rest up. Well, looks like we're taking a line of coneheads to Europe. Yeah... If they can keep their legs under them. All right, Herb, I'll see you next week. Something on your mind, Craig? Or is that just too far off my radar? You know, I just don't think you can push them this hard, Herb. Not for six months. It's too long. - They're doing all right. - Well, they're tired. Whole team's tired. I know how hard to push them, Craig. You sure about that? You know why I had them take that test? Make sure I could push them this hard. I'll see you Monday. All right. Oh, wow. Dynamite. Look over here, Phillie. Section two, about four rows up. Two girls. Blond. Man, they're gorgeous. - What row? - Twins. About the seventh row up. - Seventh row up? - To the right. Lovely blond girls. Maybe we can take a few home with us. Must be something in the water. Get a whistle. Good game. Good game. Good game. Hold up, there. Hold up, hold up. Gotta get back on the ice. Let's go. - What for? - You'll find out soon enough. Let's go. Back on the ice. Come on, boys. - Are we trading pins or something? - What for? We'll find out in a minute, won't we? Let's go. Come on. Come on, guys, let's go see what he wants. - Get a picture or something? - What's going on? You guys don't want to work during the game? No problem. We'll work now. Goal line. That one! Hustle! Think you can win on talent alone? Gentlemen, you don't have enough talent to win on talent alone. Again. If you think you can come in here and play the Norwegian national team and tie them and then go to the Olympics and win... You got another thing coming. You better think about something else, each and every one of you. When you pull on that jersey, you represent yourself and your teammates. And the name on the front is a hell of a lot more important than the one on the back! Get that through your head! Again! Win, lose, or tie, you're gonna play like champions! Again! Kick it in the ass, Verchota! You want to go home early? Keep it going, Suter. All the way to the line and all the way back. It's not that difficult. Again! Again. Again! Herb... What? Uh, the rink manager, he--he wants to clean the ice and then go home. Well, tell him to leave me the keys. I'll lock up. Again. Again. You keep playing this way, you won't beat anybody who's even good, let alone great. You want to make this team, then you better start playing at a level that's gonna force me to keep you here. Again! Thank God. Think we're getting out of here? Hey. Where you going? Back on the line. Again. Send them. Again. Again. How about it, Silky? You gonna be the first one to quit on me? How about you, OC? You ready to go down? Oh, I think I got my money on you, Verchota. Of course, you got a hot date in about an hour, but you're not looking too good for that right about now, are you? Send them. Again. Doc, I mean, this is madness, right? This cannot be a team of common men... Because common men go nowhere. You have to be uncommon. Again. Herb! This has gone on long enough! Everybody on that line. Somebody's going to get hurt! Everybody get on that line. Hey. Again. Again. Herb... Come on, Craig. Blow the whistle. Again. Mike Eruzione! Winthrop, Massachusetts! Who do you play for? I play for... The United States of America. That's all, gentlemen. Come on, you Minnesotans! My back's starting to hurt from carrying you all. Pretend you're pushing some cows! Come on! Why don't you stop talking, Boston boy, and start pushing? - What do you got there, Pav? - Three 9's. - Not bad, Pav. - Not bad. I got two 7's... Well, we were taxiing out to the runway, right, and, uh, we, you know, we kind of hit a moose. No, the moose is-- the moose is fine. But we gotta make sure the airplane's all right now, so some of the boys are out there pushing it back so these guys can take a look at it. Now finds itself in the driver's seat... Patti, the moose is OK. He ran off. I saw it. So... what's going on at home? Big matchup tonight in New York between the NHL all-stars and the Soviet Union. Yeah, she did, huh? And this one, ladies and gentlemen, was no contest, As the Soviets dominated the NHL's best from start to finish, - Mm-hmm. - Winning by a score of 6-0. The Soviets, led by the superb play of their captain, Boris Mikhailov, were superior to the NHL stars in every way tonight. Their passing was crisper, their offense was relentless, and their conditioning, superb. No, no, no, no, I'm here. I'm listening. Once again, the Soviets coasting to a 6-0 win in New York tonight. An embarrassing evening for the NHL all-stars. Russian style of play, boys. Fluid. Creative. Forwards are constantly circling. They don't so much look for the man as they do a patch of ice. They get the mismatch, two-on-one, easy goal. - Oh! - Oh! Looks a lot like me out there, huh, Buzz? Boris Mikhailov. Captain for the last six years. He is the best player at his position. And that includes, as we've just found out, the NHL. Do these guys ever smile? They're Russians. They get shot if they smile. Wow. Vladislav Tretiak. Whoa. You score on Tretiak, keep the puck. 'Cause it doesn't happen often. Forty-two games in the last 3 months, 42 wins. Their main weapon is intimidation. They know they're gonna win, and so do their opponents. Look... I can give you all a load of crap about how you're a better team than they are, but that's exactly what it'd be. And everyone in this room knows what people are saying about our chances. I know it. You know it. But I also know there is a way... to stay with this team. You don't defend them. You attack them. You take their game and you shove it right back in their face. The team that is finally willing to do this is the team that has a chance to put them down. NHL won't change their game. We will. Rest of the world is afraid of them. Boys, we won't be. No one has ever worked hard enough to skate with the Soviet team for an entire game. Gentlemen, we are gonna work hard enough. Come on, quick feet, boys! Quick feet! Work it! Work hard now, boys! Come on, Strobel, pick up your knees! Keep your shoulders square. Push it! Come on, boys. Go! The legs feed the wolf, boys. The legs feed the wolf. Go! Stay with him, Jimmy! Stay with him, Jimmy! Damn it! How's your legs? I'll let you know when I can feel them. Come on, boys. Go get him, go get him! Attaboy, Jimmy. Better. Not good, but better. You gotta have the mental intensity, boys. Move, boys! There you go, there you go! That's it. Work it, boys. Work it. Quick feet! Push it! Hit the tape, boys. Passes come from the heart. Want to stretch things out North and South. Then we got the coneheads on the line here, OK? Take me through it here. Bah. I'm gonna stretch the D out and across. Gonna open up some space here. What are we gonna do with it? - I'm gonna fill the open lane. - And I'm gonna fill in for Pav's lane. Exactly. That's it, that's it! Attaway, boys. - Come on. - Attaway, Jimmy! Don't let them have it, Jimmy! Attaboy! Yeah! Come on, build your legs up, boys. Build your legs. You're not gonna have anything left for the third period if you don't build your legs now. Here. What's that give us, boys? - Options. Options. - All right, let's run it. - How's it going, Craig? - Hey, Herb, what's going on? We're playing the Soviets three days before Lake Placid? Yeah, how about that? How about that? How about that? Ah, that won't work with Wells. Oh, Rizzo, you're killing me. Why can't you find the net? Herb, you've been staring at the same piece of paper since you finished dinner. Take a break. How do I cut this kid? He's done everything I've asked of him. Well, so keep him. I didn't think it was gonna be this hard. This is NBC Nightly News... Yeah, you did. With Jessica Savitch, and Dick Schaap with sports. This isn't gonna work. I'd have to stick Christian on defense. The embassy in Tehran is in the hands of Muslim students tonight. Wait a minute. That works. Spurred on by an anti-American speech - Or baker. - By the Ayatollah Khomeini, they stormed the embassy, fought the marine guard for three hours, overpowered them, and took dozens of American hostages. - Oh, my God. - Hmm, maybe that'll work. Herb... We have two reports, beginning with Steve Mallory Herb. Turn around. Look at this. United States Marine Corps guards used tear gas to try to disperse the mob of Islamic students, but that wasn't enough. Hundreds of Iranians finally overran the embassy compound, seizing about 90 people, mostly Americans. Oh, my God. The hostages, men and women, were blindfolded and herded into the embassy's basement. Oh, boy. Earlier today, the Ayatollah Khomeini publicly... We gave those guys at Harvard-- we gave them a good schooling. Hey! How about Johnson and McClanahan now? Yeah. Come on, that works. Doesn't it? - We got something there. - They're starting to come together. - Thanks for coming out. - I wouldn't have missed it. - Hey, you beat Harvard. - Yeah. Well, I should probably get going. Yeah. Yeah. I love you, pop. You too, son. - Jimmy... - Yeah? You keep that glove up. You got it. Switch. Rizzo's making dinner, boys. You know there's gonna be some meatballs. You boys keep eating them, I'll keep making them. I think you guys are insane to eat that stuff. - No offense, Rizzo. - Yeah. I was just wondering how it's gonna affect the chemistry of the boys. I don't know. We'll see. The one with three teeth? Timmy. She had five. Who the hell is that? What's he doing here? How you doing, Tim? Good to see you. Thanks, coach. Hey, Bah... - Yeah? - Who's that guy? Timmy Harrer. Plays for the gophers. Having a big year. - What the hell's he doing here? - No idea. Why is he here? Hey, you guys know he was coming? So, listen, why don't you, uh, warm up, stretch out, jump on Johnson's line for the day, OK? Good to have you here. - See you, boys. - See you. This is ridiculous. Don't worry about it, Rammer. It'll be all right. Right, OC? Herb's not gonna do a damn thing, boys. He's just messing with our minds. Oh, you think so, Jack? Yeah, I do. Well, we all know Herb made the Olympic team back in '60. So? So, a week before the games, coach Riley calls him into his office and sends him home. What's your point? My point, Jack, is that one week later, Herb's home on his couch with his old man, watching his team win the gold medal. Come that close and get nothing? He'll do whatever it takes. That's my point. Yeah, I'm aware of that, Walter. Yeah. Yeah, well, I-- you've talked to everybody else then, all right. Nothing else we can do, then. Thank you, Walter. Is everything OK? Walter says that there's talk Carter may boycott the Moscow games next summer. So if we don't go there, they might not come here, right? Right. Don't do this to yourself, Herb. There are things you can control and things you can't. No milk. Herb. Yeah, I heard you, honey. You'll still have everything you won here at Minnesota. Don't tell me what I'll have, Patti. You don't know this enough to tell me that. You know, I understand you being upset with me when I say you work too hard teaching a simple game. But don't ever criticize me for caring about you. That's it. Come on, boys, push it. Here we go! Push it! Go now! Move! Damn it! Come on, Rizzo. I know, coach. - I know. - You know? If you knew, then why did you do it... again? You better start putting the puck in the net, Rizzo, or you're not going anywhere. And don't think I won't do it. Johnson, line up! Let's go! Come on! Shoot it! Come on! Shoot it! Up and around! Keep it moving! Attaboy! Center, center, center! Now move it up! Go, Mike, go! Drop it back. Go to the net, Timmy! Go to the net! Go, go, go! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Nice play, boys. Nice play. Goal scored by number 18, Tim Harrer. Change them up, boys. Let's go. Come on, boys. Let's go, boys! Timmy. You drive the net. You keep driving the net. That's all I care about all night long, OK? That puck goes across the blue line, you drive to the net. - That's all that matters. - OK. All right. Herb. Some of the boys want to have a word. What about? I think you ought to hear them out. This had better take about two minutes. This is crazy, Herb, bringing him in this late. Hey, we got parents buying tickets, mean, getting rooms. I mean, what are we supposed to tell them? - And with one of us going home as it is? - Oh, I guess I don't have to ask where you stand on this, huh, Rizzo? This wasn't Rizzo's idea. You want me to say I'm scared of getting cut? I'm scared of getting cut. Everybody is. We just want it to be fair, Herb. Don't even try telling me that. He was right there in Colorado. That was six months ago. You don't think he's been playing for the last six months? - Not with us, he hasn't. - So? - So there's a difference. - Like hell there is! All I know is that kid can flat-out play. What, and we can't? Oh, he moves the puck, he's got great vision on the ice, stick, - soft hands. - That's not the point! I'll tell you something else he's got. He's got the attitude I want on and off the ice, so somebody here better explain to me why I shouldn't be giving him a hell of a look. Because we're a family. What? We're a family. A family? Yeah. Yeah. And this is the family that you want to go to Lake Placid with? Definitely. - Yeah, without a doubt. - Absolutely. Wouldn't have it any other way. Timmy Harrer can help us, boys... And I'm gonna send him home. We got one more to get down to 20. You understand. Yep. - Looks like you got yourself a team. - Almost. Let's talk about it. The rules. Well, your girl left these at my place... With some, uh, milk and cookies. Give her a hug for me. - Silky! - You guys are unbelievable. - Real funny, guys. - Hey, boys. We still got two more presents to open up. Yeah. Yeah. - Pardon me, coach. - Yeah? - Coach Patrick, from the boys. - Oh. - Uh. - Here we go. I thought you forgot. ♪ Sentimental feeling... ♪ "To Craig." That's beautiful, boys. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ - Oh, you're gonna like this one. - What? That's very good. That's very good. - Perfect. - Again! Again! Again! Again! - Again! - All right. - That's enough of that. - Again! It's going back in the box. Right in there. And, Herb... Merry Christmas from the boys. Drumroll, please. Ooh. Coach. Ah, yes. The gift that keeps on giving. No. Speech. Speech. Ayatollah. Speech. Speech. Speech. Well, this may come as a shock to some of you guys, but I'm not really very good at giving sentimental speeches. - No? No? - You're kidding? Come on. I don't think I should start tonight, so... Hey, thanks for having me over, Velta. Good night, Herb. - Doc, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Herb. You guys have a great holiday. Merry Christmas, coach. Merry Christmas, coach. Play some football! ...by many as the most important speech of President Carter's term. A look back now as 830 WCCO's year-end special continues. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America. Here we go! Rizzo! The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July. Got it! Got it! It is the idea which founded our nation and has guided our development as a people. Confidence in the future has supported everything else. We've always believed in something called "progress." We've always had a faith that the days of our children will be better than our own. Our people are losing that faith. For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. We were taught that our armies were always invincible, And our causes were always just... Only to suffer the agony of Vietnam. We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate. We've got to stop crying and start sweating. Stop talking and start walking. Working together with our common faith. We cannot fail. Yeah. Hard workout. Silk, you guys want to go grab something to eat? Yeah, I'm starving. Where you guys gonna go? Maybe that Mario's place. Mario's? Hey, coach. Coxie... Herb wants to see you. Come in. Uh, Coach Patrick said you wanted to see me. Why don't you have a seat there, Ralph? Well, there's just no easy way of doing this. The rules say that we gotta be down to 20 men, and right now we're at 21. I wish like hell I could keep you, Ralph. - I do. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. You're a hell of a hockey player. This doesn't change that. Thanks. Well, uh... Thanks for giving me a shot, coach. Thanks for giving me your very best. Yeah? Herb, Walter. Well, you've got your wish. Brezhnev's telling Carter to screw himself. Yeah, Walter, how's that? The Kremlin just released a statement today Saying they're gonna prove how good they are by beating us over here on our own ice. They're all gonna play-- The Soviets, the Czechs, the whole bunch of them. Have you got your roster finalized yet? Yeah, I got my team. Well, I still don't know why you scheduled this, Herb, but get your guys to New York. They've got a game to play. ♪ Oh, say ♪ ♪ Does that star-spangled Banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the brave ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, your 1980 US Olympic team. And so, as we await the opening face-off in this game between the Soviet Union and team USA here at Madison Square Garden, the teams line up on their respective blue lines. And Soviet Union team captain, Boris Mikhailov skating over to his bench to pick up that NHL challenge trophy, the trophy that his team won here at Madison Square Garden last October, and won in decisive fashion, beating the NHL all-stars. Getting a mixed reaction from the capacity audience, here at Madison Square Garden-- Some cheers, but a few boos going through the crowd, as well. And now the two teams clear the ice and repair to their respective goals as we get set for the opening face-off in this final tune-up for these two teams before the Olympic games in Lake Placid. One, two, three. USA! And as we get set to drop the puck for this contest, the soviets starting their big line of Mikhailov between Kharlamov and Petrov. Team USA countering with Mark Johnson at center between MccCanahan and Dave Silk. And we're ready to go with this warm-up contest. Want to go hard, boys? Here! And It's the Soviet union in Control, making a charge into the team USA zone. - A shot from the point goes off the post. - Corner! Corner! And in behind the team USA net. Puck bounced back to the blue line. Moving in with a shot, stopped by Jimmy Craig, and it goes into the corner. Get it out, boys! And finally, team USA gets its stick on the puck As Ramsey brings it up to the blue line. He's absolutely flattened there by Kasatonov. Two-on-one! Two-on-one! Team Soviet Union turning it into a two-on-one. Back door, OC, look out! Get the puck! Moving in to the boards, shoots and scores. Come on! Hey, break it up! Break it up! That's it. Let's go. That's a nice expression on your face, you dummy. Let's get it back, boys. Get it back! Jack, you gotta listen to me! You gotta listen to me! The Soviets breaking out of their own zone now, up the ice to center. Krutov goes in over the US blue line. Shoots and scores. He's in front... and scores. Shoots... He scores. He shoots. He scores! The Soviet Union drubbing team USA 10-3. There's--there's always things you can work on. I mean, this club's no exception to that. You know, I--I think we're gonna be all right. This Soviet team has been playing together for 10 years. We got a bunch of college kids out there still getting to know each other. They could have won this thing 30-0. Coach Brooks, can we get a comment, please? Herb, Herb! Herb Brooks! Sorry. How is he? Well, I'm not sure if he needs surgery yet. I'm--I'm hoping it's just a ligament pull, but it could be a tear. Look, Herb, we got three days until Sweden. You give him a roster spot, it's a waste of money. Give me a best case here, doc. He'll miss three or four games minimum. Now, that's the whole qualifying round. Kid's made the team, he's busted his ass for me for seven months, and now I gotta send him home-- that the deal? What'd doc say? Oh, he doesn't know yet, OC. He's... gonna go with you to the hospital and get a picture of your knee taken and then, uh... Then we'll see. - Thinking about sitting you down, Jim. - What? - Hey, what are you talking about? - Nah, it's not your fault. I played you way too much, and you're too tired. Oh, and besides that, I think it's time I gave Jannie a look. He's been waiting for seven months. You're kidding me. Now? Yeah, of course I mean now. That's my net, man. You can't do that. They just scored ten goals, Jim. Right now it's everybody's net. Whoa, wait a second. I've given you everything I've got. - Now you're pulling the plug on me? - Have you? Given me your very best? 'Cause I know there's a lot more in you-- a whole other level that for some reason you just don't want to go to. Oh, what the hell. You don't even understand what I'm talking about. Oh, no, no, I'll tell you what I don't understand, Herb. I don't understand you. Nobody on this team understands you and your ridiculous sayings and your drills and those stupid psychology tests you had everybody take. Everybody? What? So that's what this is about? Because I didn't take your test? Fine! You want me to take your test, I'll take your test. - Is that what you want? - No. I want to see that kid in the net who wouldn't take the test. You gotta be kidding me. What did he do? Well, he did something amazing, Herb. He--he started to laugh. And then everybody in the whole audience started to laugh, and-- I-- It's-- It sounds funny, but I was so proud of him. You know, I was starting to think that our son takes after you. Well, that's all part of my plan. My, you're a very smart woman. I miss you. Oh, the games are only a couple of days away now. You got your airplane tickets? Oh, yeah. Walter had them sent over. Yeah. I guess I'll see you then. You sound tired. You should try and get some sleep. - Yeah, well... - All right. - I'll talk to you, babe. - Hey, Patti. Yeah? I miss you, too. Good night. Good night. OK, I'll check on OC. Take care of these guys here. Come on, guys. Stick with me. Next. Step up. This is your room key. And this is your ID badge that you'll need for just about everything. Don't lose it. Herb. Herb. Herb, it'll--it'll be fine. I can-- I can fight through it. OK, why don't you join the boys over there, OC? It's good to see you, kid. Attaboy. - Well? - The good news is it's not a tear. It's a stretched ligament, so he won't need surgery. But there is no way he can play before the medal round. Forget about the medal round. You keep O'Callahan, and you lose one more skater, you're gonna have a tough time putting a decent hockey team on the ice. It's that simple. I asked Herb. He doesn't-- he's keeping me in the dark. Oh, boy. So if he gets shaky, it's you. - I will. - Stay loose, Jannie. - All right. - It's unbelievable. You're in there tomorrow, Jimmy. Let's bring it up, now. OK. Thanks a lot, man. Attaboy, Jimmy. Go get them. He had me checked. - What'd he say? - I'll see you on the bus. All right. Doc said no, right? He said you might be able to go in a week, maybe two. What if it's two? That puts me in a tight spot, doesn't it? Jack, I got 20 guys to think about here, and they're all looking at me to do what's best for this team. I understand, Coach. Which is why I'm hanging on to you. I swear to God, Herb, if you're not being serious right now-- I'm only saying this if you promise right now you won't even think about asking me to play - until I tell you-- - I won't. I--I mean, I will, I promise you, coach. 'Cause if you do, Jack, I'll stick your ass on an airplane and you're headed back to Boston. All right, Doc's waiting for you. Thank you, Herb. Whooooo! OC is playing, baby! Ha ha ha! Boys, move your feet! Ramsey with the puck, passes to Eruzione. Eruzione carrying the puck up the boards. Drops the pass for Broten. He shoots-- kicked away by Lindbergh. Boys, hit that one-timer now. Come on! Al Michaels with Ken Dryden, and with 4:10 to go in the first period, it's Sweden leading the United Sates 1-0. Coach! Ahlberg to Eriksson. And a big hit by Dave Christian. Eriksson picks up the loose puck, passes to Lundqvist. Lundqvist to Ahlberg. Mike, where is it? - Up. This way. - OK. OK. - Yeah, yeah, that. - That's it. Ahlberg shoots. Save by Craig. Eruzione fighting for it. Mike Eruzione recently named team captain by coach Herb Brooks for his firm footing, his leadership qualities on and off the ice. Hey, I'm taking him out. The US team is playing very tentative hockey tonight, Al. Tough draw having to face Sweden, third-best team in the world, coming into these games. - You know what I mean? - No, I got you. Look, I--I--I think it's worth a try. OK. - What's the deal with Mac? - Upper-leg contusion. I think he's done for the night. - What if he plays? - I don't understand, Herb. The injury-- If he plays on it, can he hurt it any worse? Well, no, but it will be very painful for him, and he won't be able to do very much. This is unbelievable! You guys are playing like this is some throwaway game up in Rochester. - Who we playing, Rammer? - Sweden. Yeah, you're damn right! Sweden! In the Olympics! What the hell's wrong with you? Put your gear on. I said, "Put your gear on." - Doc told me I can't play. - Yeah, yeah, I know. You got a bad bruise. You know what? Put your street clothes on 'cause I got no time for quitters. Come on, Herb. Nobody's quitting here. You worry about your own game. Plenty there to keep you busy. A bruise on the leg is a hell of a long way from the heart, you candy-ass. What'd you call me? You heard me. You want me to play, huh? Is that what you want? - I want you to be a hockey player! - I am a hockey player! - You want me to play on one leg, huh? - Calm down. I'll play on one leg! - That'll get them going. - Get off me! Oh, yeah. - Will that make you happy? - I'll clean up. - Huh, Herb? I am a hockey player! - Easy, easy, Mac! 2:49 remaining in the game, Sweden leading 2-1. The US team has fought hard these last two periods, but they've still got nothing to show for it. This is a crucial game. If they don't beat or tie the Swedes, it'll be very difficult to advance to the medal round. McClanahan after the loose puck. He's hit hard by Soderstrom. Go, go, go, Mac! Come on, Mac! McClanahan gutting it out despite being injured in the first period. Silky! Silky! Silk to Johnson. Back to Silk. Through the neutral zone. Attaboy, Mac! Keep going! Keep going! Dumped into the Swedish zone and stopped behind the net by Lindbergh. Johnson fighting Eriksson for it now. It goes out to Waltin. Ooh, he's hit hard by MccCanahan. - All right, Mac! - Baker, you're up next on the right side. - What? - Take the right side. The Swedes regain control behind their own net, 1:40 remaining in the game. Coneheads, you're up next. Mats Waltin moving it out to Jan Eriksson. Let's go, Buzzy. Jan Eriksson out to Hakan Eriksson. - Across the US blue line. - Take it back, boys! Take it back! - Into the corner. - Stay with him. Stay with him, Ramsey. Stay with him. - Watch the slot! - Passes across to Ahlberg. Wrist shot-- Knocked out of the air by Craig. Puck picked up by Suter, moved ahead to Johnson. Switch them up! Go, go, go, go! Johnson gets rid of it and heads to the bench with just over a minute and a half left to play. Precious seconds ticking away for this US team. What are you doing with baker out there? 1:20, Herb. Herb Brooks has molded this unit, seven rigorous months of training. Points to the net, just a little over a minute left to avoid a very damaging loss. Ahlberg up the wing to Hakan Eriksson in the slot. Stopped by Craig. Rebound picked up by Schneider. Schneider flying up the wing, over the blue line, and into the corner. Jimmy, come on now! And Brooks is pulling goalie Jim Craig - for an extra skater to try to tie it up. - Go, go, go! 45 seconds left to play. Sweden leading the US team 2-1. Across to Silk. He moves in. His backhander is stopped by Lindbergh. Thirty-nine seconds remaining. Let's go, Baker! Schneider to Ramsey, across to Baker. He wraps it around the boards. Baker fighting for the puck with Naslund. Back to Ramsey at the point. To Johnson in front. Broken up by Holmgren. Kept in by Baker and fired behind the net. Get a shot, get a shot! Loose puck. Schneider and Waltin fighting for it. Schneider holds him off. Kicks it loose. Pavelich has it. He makes a move around Hakan Eriksson. Hits across to Baker. He scores! The United States has tied it. Bill Baker scores in the final minute of the game! And the US team is still very much alive in the opening round of these Olympics Hey, it was a hell of a move. I didn't see him out there. I'm Jim McKay, and we're back again live in Lake Placid, New York. What an amazing start for these 13th Olympic Winter Games. After a remarkable last-minute tie against Sweden two nights ago, the US hockey team, huge underdogs, pulled off a tremendous upset last night, defeating Czechoslovakia, considered the second-best team in the world behind the Soviet Union. The final score, 7-3. "Why so many reporters?" Are you serious? Well, we won two games. I mean, we got a ways to go here. Think of what they've had to write about the last couple of months, hostages, Afghanistan... Transportation chaos. Patti probably has talked to you about that. Listen, Herb, the bottom line is that your young guys just kicked the crap out of Czechoslovakia, and this is something that this country is ready for. Now, you want to see reporters? Win a couple of more games. They are just kids, Walter, so let's not turn this into something more, OK? I'm not sure we got any control over it. Victor. Somebody's gonna beat those guys. Buzz Schneider flying up the right wing. Takes a long pass from Ramsey. Now he's all alone on the breakaway. He shoots! He scores! Buzz Schneider on a breakaway puts the US up 5-1 in the third period. Coach Brooks! Monsieur! Monsieur! Herb! Herb, now that Norway is behind you, what do you look for out of Romania? It should be a real tough test. Uh, we're sure not gonna overlook them. Mike. All right, Jimmy Craig's been great between the pipes. Is there any chance we could talk to him? Well, as I said the other night, uh, Mike, you know, this isn't an individual effort going on here. It's a-- it's about a team. We're a team on the ice, and we're gonna be one off it. Palavka breaking up the left side, chased by Christian. Behind the US net. Drops the pass. Slams it. Shot. Glove save by Jim Craig. The US up 7-2 here late in the third. Well, making it to the medal round was always our goal from day one, so, uh, we feel real good about what we've accomplished so far. Herb! Herb! Herb! Still no chance we can talk with any of your players? - Still no chance. - OK. Well, how do you respond to those who feel that you're just doing this to keep the spotlight on yourself? Luzbach. Esom across to Krutzman. Ooh! He's hit hard into the boards by Strobel. Huge hit. Ramsey has it, moves it up to Verchota. Verchota across the blue line. Lines up-- He scores! Verchota puts it past Sutner to put the US up 4-2 with 15:43 remaining to play here in the third period. And we'll be staying with this one right to the end. The, uh, pairings for the medal round are as follows-- The United States will play the Soviet Union in the first game tomorrow. Sweden and Finland in the second game. Uh, the face-off for the US-Soviet game is 1700 hours. Now, if you have any questions, uh, we have the US Assistant coach, Craig Patrick. Patrick. Coach Patrick. - Craig. - Coach Patrick. Right here. Where's Herb Brooks? How come he's not here today? Uh, Herb is out preparing for, uh, tomorrow's game. Craig! Craig! Craig! Yeah? Yeah? Hi, daddy. There we go. There was no whipped cream. That's all right. - What? - What? I got a telegram from a lady in Texas today. - You know what it said? - Hmm? "Beat those commie bastards." Wow. We're playing a hockey game against the greatest team in the world-- maybe the best that's ever played this game. Why can't we just leave it at that? Because this is more than a hockey game to a lot of people. Yeah, well, I keep running through them all. Johnson on Mikhailov, Broten on Petrov, Pav against whoever... Ov. We just... We don't match up, Patti. You might want to skip that when you talk to the boys tomorrow. Just... Herb. Herb. There's no disgrace in losing to this team. I know. The important thing is... You got this far. The important thing... is those 20 boys knowing in 20 years, they didn't leave anything on the table. That they played their hearts out. That's the important thing. Tickets. OK. Hey, Craig. - Walter. - Great, great job. - Great. - Thanks. - Sure is. - Hey, Craig. Any chance we can come in and wish the boys luck? Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. Uh, you know Herb. Uh, not a good time right now. - After the game, all right? - All right? - Hey, Craig, whoa, hold up. Hold up. - I can't. Herb doesn't want any distractions. It's understandable. We just wanted to wish them luck. OK, that's--that's... Hmm. You ready to go? You serious? Am I playing? Suit up. Great moments... are born from great opportunity. And that's what you have here tonight, boys. That's what you've earned here tonight. One game. If we played them ten times, they might win nine. But not this game. Not tonight. Tonight we skate with them. Tonight we stay with them. And we shut them down because we can. Tonight we are the greatest hockey team in the world. You were born to be hockey players. Every one of you. And you were meant to be here tonight. This is your time. Their time is done. It's over. I'm sick and tired of hearing about what a great hockey team the Soviets have. Screw them. This is your time. Now, go out there and take it. USA! USA! USA! Hold up here a second, guys. We're just gonna wait for the OK. Yeah. We're all set. All right. Go ahead and send them in. OK. It's time. Let's go. Come on, Jimmy. Let's go. Come on, Buzzy. Let's hustle. Here we go. Come on, Bakes. Come on, Brots. Come on, Dave. Let's go, Strobel. Rizzo! Let's go. Let's go. USA! USA! USA! The excitement, the tension building. The Olympic center filling to capacity. The face value of a top ticket for tonight's game-- $67.20. Outside they were exchanging hands at three times the face value. USA! USA! USA! Hello again, everybody. I'm Al Michaels along with Ken Dryden. It should be a great night. I'm sure there are a lot of people in this building who do not know the difference between a blue line and a clothesline. It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter. Because what we have at hand, the rarest of sporting events. An event that needs no buildup, no superfluous adjectives. In a political or nationalistic sense, I'm sure this game s being viewed with varying perspectives. But manifestly it is a hockey game. The United States and the Soviet Union on a sheet of ice in Lake Placid, New York. Ken, some of your thoughts before the game. Well, for the US team, it's really discovery time. It's--it's one thing to be young and promising and it's quite another to be good. And in the next two and a half hours, the US players will go through perhaps the most difficult and demanding yet exhilarating time of their lives. They will be playing against probably the best team in the world, a team that's far better than they are, a team that's dominated World Hockey for the last 15 years. In the crowd, Jim Craig's father, Donald Craig. It's been a difficult time for the Craig family with the passing of Jimmy's mom. One of her dreams was to have her son play on this team. So this has to be an emotional night for the two of them. They don't look too nervous down there. The US team, very young. Average age, 21 years old. The Soviets much more seasoned. Some of them have been playing together for the last 15 years. Let's go, here, boys. Let's go, here, boys. And this game is about to get underway. All right. On three, boys. One, two, three! USA! Jim Craig in goal for the United States. Vladislav Tretiak, considered the best goalie in the world, in the nets for the Soviet Union. The US team in white, skating up to center ice. The Soviet Union in red, all business. And here we go. Face-off is won by Mikhailov. Back to Kasatonov. Move on him! Move on him! Carried up ice by Kasatonov. The pass is to Petrov. Puck picked up by Morrow. Pressured by Mikhailov. The pass in front of the US net. - And a shot deflected by Craig. - Watch the middle! Come on, Jimmy. Keep it out of the middle, boys! Jim Craig tested for the first time. Dave Silk with the puck along the boards. Taken away by Kasatonov. Up ahead to Petrov. Petrov streaking up the boards. Powering past Ramsey. A centering pass to Kharlamov. - Attaboy! - He shoots. Saved by Jim Craig! Puck cleared out of the US zone. Big hit on McClanahan by the Soviet captain, Boris Mikhailov. Krutov with a hard shot from the high slot. Craig with the save! Golikov across to Petrov. Again Craig is equal to the task. Come on, boys. Use those boards. Get it out. Use those boards! Petrov with the puck across the US blue line. Pass is across to Kharlamov. Shot. Stopped! - Petrov tries to lead now. - Watch point! To Makarov at the point. He fires it along the boards. Picked up behind the net by Buzz Schneider. - Come on! - That's a slash! Schneider losing it. Out to the point. Slap shot! Deflected in! That was a slash! The Soviet Union takes a 1-0 lead. Kasatonov's slap shot was deflected in past Craig. So the Soviet Union leads, 1-0, early in the first period. Forget about it. Forget about it now. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Mikhailov and Christoff facing off at center ice. - The puck to Fetisov. - Here we go, boys. Move it! Across to the veteran Kharlamov. - Kharlamov to Mikhailov. - Pick it up! Pick it up! Mikhailov up the boards and into the corner. To Kharlamov for a quick shot. Big save by Jim Craig. Makarov with the puck now. Craig gets his stick on it. Hey, Jimmy! The US in possession now. Ramsey moving it up to Johnson. Johnson is hung up by Blyaletdinov, who feeds it around the boards, where it's picked up by Krutov. Golikov crossing the blue line. He's hit hard by Ken Morrow! - Attaboy! - The puck is picked up by Eruzione. And he's sent hard into the boards by Krutov. Johnson with it now. Flying up the boards. You got time. You got time. - OC, go! - Avoids the hit from Golikov. OC, get in there! The Soviets control it. Kasatonov. Let's see the "D"! Krutov with the puck now. A big hit by Jack O'Callahan. Pavelich up ahead to Schneider. Slap shot. Whoo! Yeah! That's the type of goal you don't expect someone like Tretiak to give up. And the United States ties the game at one. Jack O'Callahan returning after a serious knee injury at Madison Square Garden, making a big contribution with that hit on Krutov. Number 16, Pavelich. Time, 14:03. Petrov to Kharlamov. Skating into the US zone. Tying up O'Callahan. Golikov. Cross-ice pass to Petrov. He shoots. And Craig is right there! Picked up by O'Callahan. Moves up to Pavelich. Go! Go! Go! Get it! Get it! Through the middle. Crossing the Soviet Blue line. Centering pass. Cleared by Fetisov. - Talk to each other out there, boys. - Over to Kharlamov. - Play your position! - Flipped to Krutov. Krutov with the puck. Through the neutral zone. Knifes through the defense. Right in front. Picked up by Mark Johnson. Nice move to get around Blyaletdinov as he moves up the ice. Another great move around Makarov, charging for the net. Hit by Golikov and sent flying over the net and into the boards. The Soviets now working out of their own zone. Pick him up. Pick him up. Don't let him through the middle. Golikov crossing center ice. Leaves it for Makarov. Makarov around Morrow. And he scores. Oh! Makarov put the puck right between Morrow's legs, skated in, and scored. That was a textbook Soviet passing play. Beautifully done. Once this team gets rolling, it's almost impossible to stop them. Twenty-four gets the goal. Give 25 the assist, boys. And with the Soviets leading, 2-1, Ken, the US teams knows that all too well after what happened with these two teams at Madison Square Garden 13 days ago. Now tonight's referee, Carl Keisler, calling the players over for the face-off. And you can hear the crowd trying to reinvigorate this US team. Face-off won by the Soviets. Fetisov across to Kasatonov. He circles behind his own net. Leaves it for Fetisov. Get the pressure on them in there! Come on! Quick pass up to Kharlamov, who moves it over to Mikhailov. - Pick him up! Pick him up!- - Watch the pass! Watch the pass! Skating across the US blue line. To Maltsev. Over to Makarov. Shot stopped by Craig. Don't let them have that middle so easy, boys. Less than a half minute remaining in the first period. And the US can't clear it. Petrov with the puck. Quick pass to Kharlamov. Stopped by Craig! Petrov tries for the rebound. - Move it out! Move it out! - Craig knocks it away. Kasatonov with a shot. Craig with another save! Keep going hard, now, boys! Play it out! And the US team finally clears it. It looks like the US will be able to end the period only a goal down, a tremendous achievement. Johnson, go! And the puck is picked up by Christian in the neutral zone. Long shot. Easy save by Tretiak. But Johnson is there. And scores! With one second to play in the period! Right now the clock shows nothing. It was stopped at one when we looked up and the goal was scored. Right now it shows nothing as the period, apparently, has come to an end. But the United States has tied the game. A big, big goal for the US team. Dave Christian took a shot from the other side of center ice, knowing there was almost no time on the clock. But the rebound comes right out to Mark Johnson, who goes wide of Tretiak to tie it up. Tikhonov very upset. Questioning the goal. The time on the clock shows zero. Keisler, the referee, indicating that the goal stands and the period is over. And this crowd is electrified. Whoo! Whoo! Tikhonov, like his team, not normally prone to showing much emotion. As the teams skate off to their respective dressing rooms, this game is tied at two on an incredible last-second goal by Mark Johnson. ♪ Coke adds life ♪ ♪ Have a coke and a... ♪ Wow! Thanks, Mean Joe. ♪ Smile ♪ And we're back for the start of the second period for what is turning out to be a very exciting game. If you're just joining us, there were four goals scored in the first period. Two by the Soviets, two by the Americans. And there'll be a change for the Soviet Union, as Vladimir Myshkin becomes the new goalie after Tretiak had given up two goals in the first period. Al, this is a big move. Tretiak's been Tikhonov's bread and butter for a decade. Still, Myshkin is a very capable backup. Well, boys, you just put the best goaltender in the world on the bench. It is very uncommon to see Vladislav Tretiak taken out of a game and something we have not seen in these Olympics. Let's go, now, boys. Come on! And here we go. The second period is underway. The conehead line out for the United States. Jim Craig in goal. Krutov with the puck. Down the right side. Centering pass. Shot. Swatted away by Craig. Attaboy, Jimmy! Harrington breaks out. He gets behind the defense! - He has a breakaway! - Come on. Block! He can give the US the lead. He shoots. Stopped by Myshkin. Fetisov up to Maltsev. Maltsev gets past Christian. Shoots. The rebound! Maltsev scores! And the Soviets take the lead, 3-2. Jim Craig knocked down on the play by Kharlamov, allowing Maltsev an easy goal on an open net. And Jim Craig's not getting up, Ken. This could be devastating to the US, Al. Jimmy! Jimmy, you all right? Jim Craig's been the anchor of this team, playing every minute of every game here in Lake Placid. Herb Brooks may now be faced with replacing Craig with his backup goalie, Steve Janaszak. Janaszak played on Brooks' championship team Jannie. Last year at the University of Minnesota. But he's played very little over the last six months and not at all during these Olympics. - Jimmy, you need doc? - No. I'm good. Just give me a second. Take your time. Take your time. Jim Craig back on his feet now. Shaking it off, and it appears he'll remain in this game. Attaboy, Jimmy! All right! Getting a huge hand from this very appreciative crowd. So with 17 minutes remaining to play in the second period, Come on, boys. Let's get them, now! Come on! The Soviet Union, 3, the United States, 2. Now we're back for the start of the third period. 20 minutes left in a game that's closer than most anyone anticipated. The teams were tied, 2-2, after the first. And the Soviets are now leading, 3-2. Al Michaels here at the Olympic Center with former Montreal Canadiens goalie Ken Dryden. The American team comes into this medal round unbeaten. The Soviets are also unbeaten, winning all five of their games, scoring 51 goals in the process. The US, four wins and a tie against Sweden and a huge upset win over Czechoslovakia eight days ago. Herb Brooks' young team is trying to overcome enormous odds to beat the best team in the world tonight. Boys! Come here! Bring it in. Listen to them. USA! USA! USA! That's what you've done. Now, we've come from behind in every game in this tournament so far, and we can do it again. USA! USA! USA! We can beat these guys! Come on, Herb. Get your guys to the face-off. Everybody in. Let's go, boys. Come on, boys. Let's do this. Who do you play for? USA! Come on, boys! As the third period begins, the crowd is chanting. Everyone on their feet. The Americans are winless against the Soviets since 1960. And since that day at Squaw Valley, it's been 20 years since a US team has defeated the Soviets. The Soviets, of course, have been gold-medal winners in every Olympic games since 1960. The top Soviet line is out there right now. Mikhailov at center. He's flanked by Petrov and Kharlamov. On defense, Kasatonov and Fetisov. And in net, Vladimir Myshkin... Face-off won by Johnson. Ramsey with the puck. Up to Johnson. Johnson. Wrist shot. - Pick him up! Pick him up! - Stopped by Myshkin. Puck is picked up by Kasatonov. To Mikhailov. Over to Kharlamov, who carries it into the US zone. Shot. Stick save by Jim Craig. - Picked up in the corner by Krutov. - I got it! I got it!

Christian with the puck now. And he goes down! And we've got a penalty coming up on the Soviets. Sixteen red! Petrov going off for slashing. Coneheads! Let's go! Coneheads! This is a big opportunity for the US. They haven't been able to go on the offense for quite some time now, Sixteen A slash. and this is the chance. Soviet Union penalty to number 16. Come on, boys. Let's take advantage of this now! O'Callahan moving it up. Slips by Kharlamov. Set it up, boys! Set it up! A long pass from Harrington. Harrington inside the Soviet blue line. Over! Back to O'Callahan. Back to Harrington now. To Ramsey at the point. Over to Schneider. Shot. Stopped by Myshkin! Bilyaletdinov clears the zone. Keep it going, now, boys. Keep up the intensity!

Loose puck. Picked up by Johnson. He scores! Mark Johnson, with only four seconds left on the power play, ties the game at 3. Only a goal! USA goal scored by number 10, Johnson. Assist, number 8, Silk. Time, 4:43. Ken, a couple of months ago, did you think this was remotely possible? No. Absolutely not. But the thing with the US team is they're very young, very talented. And now they're beginning to believe. There's my boy! So the Americans, way to work! Just as the penalty to Krutov was about to expire, score to tie the game. Keep it going, now. 3-3, the United States and the Soviet Union. Face-off controlled by the Soviets. Kharlamov on the attack. Down into the corner. Drop pass. Kasatonov with a shot! Wide.

Pav! - Rizzo! Rizzo! - Pavelich has it now. Over to Eruzione. He shoots. He scores! Mike Eruzione! Whoo! Whoo! Right now we've got Bedlam! Anyone who was at Madison Square Garden two weeks ago who's watching this game tonight has got to be shocked. Yeah! Oh, I love Brooks' reaction. Thataway, Rizzo! Yes! Yes! Yes! USA! USA! USA! USA! And the chant resumes. Mike Eruzione out of Boston University, The captain of this US team, has just put the US ahead for the first time exactly halfway through the third period. USA goal Scored by number 21, Eruzione. This US team was demoralized by the Soviets. Very tentative. Very nervous. Very much in awe of the Soviet Team.

Whoo! Yeah! I can't believe it! USA! USA! USA! Beautiful! Beautiful! Yes! USA! USA! USA! Way to go, coach! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Whoo! USA! USA! USA! Two days later, the miracle was made complete. My boys defeated Finland to win the gold medal, coming from behind once again. As I watched them out there, celebrating on the ice... I realized that Patti had been right. It was a lot more than a hockey game. Not only for those who watched it, but for those who played in it. I've often been asked in the years since Lake Placid what was the best moment for me. Well, it was here. The sight of 20 young men of such differing backgrounds now standing as one. Young men willing to sacrifice so much of themselves... all for an unknown. A few years later, the US began using professional athletes at the games. Dream teams. I always found that term ironic because now that we have dream teams, we seldom ever get to dream. But on one weekend, as America and the world watched, a group of remarkable young men gave the nation what it needed most. A chance, for one night, not only to dream. But a chance, once again, to believe. ♪ Every time that I look I in the mirror ♪ ♪ All these lines On my face getting clearer ♪ ♪ The past is gone ♪ ♪ It went by Like dusk to dawn ♪ ♪ Isn't that the way ♪ ♪ Everybody's got their dues In life to pay ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ I know nobody knows ♪ ♪ Where it comes And where it goes ♪ ♪ I know it's Everybody's sin ♪ ♪ You got to lose To know how to win ♪ ♪ Half my life's In books' written pages ♪ ♪ Live and learn from fools And from sages ♪ ♪ You know it's true ♪ ♪ All the things come back to you ♪ ♪ Sing with me ♪ ♪ Sing for the year ♪ ♪ Sing for the laughter And sing for the tear ♪ ♪ Sing with me If it's just for today ♪ ♪ Maybe tomorrow the good Lord Will take you away ♪ ♪ Yeah, sing with me ♪ ♪ Sing for the year ♪ ♪ Sing for the laughter And sing for the tear ♪ ♪ Sing with me If it's just for today ♪ ♪ Maybe tomorrow the good Lord Will take you away ♪ ♪ Dream on dream on dream on ♪ ♪ Dream yourself a dream come true ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream until your dream come true ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ Dream on ♪ ♪ On ♪ ♪ Sing with me Sing for the year ♪ ♪ Sing for the laughter And sing for the tear ♪ ♪ Sing with me If it's just for today ♪ ♪ Maybe tomorrow the good Lord Will take you away ♪ ♪ Sing with me Sing for the year ♪ ♪ Sing for the laughter And sing for the tear ♪ ♪ Sing with me If it's just for today ♪ ♪ Maybe tomorrow the good Lord Will take you away ♪ And I know you'll do a good job.
