INSPIRED BY THE BOOK SOKOLA RIMBA AND THE EXPERIENCE OF BUTET MANURUNG I never doubted the wealth Indonesia has. Seventeen thousand islands and almost 110 million hectares of tropical forest from Aceh to Papua. All of them give us life. For me. I work for an institution in Bukit Duabelas National Park area. A National Park covering 65,000 hectares area, in Jambi, southern part of Sumatra. A forest protected by the rules of law. Ideally, it should be left untouched by the humans. The law and the work of my institution provide great benefits for the existence of the forest here. I've worked for two years in this place. But I'm still wondering, what does this mean for the people who were born in it? The Rimba people. POST REFORM ERA INDONESIA Hi. Do you need our help? -Yes? -Do you need help with your things? -It's okay. -Okay. I just want to rest. All right, then. Teacher, these are some green chiretta for you. Teacher. You almost died by the river. A boy from Makekal Downstream came to tell us about it. Who's the child who saved me? If he really came from the downstream, he must've walked far away to get here. J. This is the letter J. Drag the line down. Try writing J. Write J. Like this. Let me see. Gosh, Nengkabau! Just cut me with a machete if this is how you behave. Come here! Twenty. Twenty. Minus seven? -Thirteen. -Yes, thirteen. Thirteen times two? Twenty-four. -Twenty... -Twenty-six. Twenty-six. Correct. Twenty-six divided by two again? -Thirteen! -Right. -Right, forty-two divided by two? -Divided by two. -Twenty-one. -Twenty-one. Yes, great. Forty-six-- This is for you, Teacher. Thank you. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. A, B, C, D, E, F... Teacher. Why do sawing machines keep cutting our trees? Why? Maybe because they need a lot of wood. We use machetes so we don't take too much of them. Teacher, when we get smarter, we can stop those outsiders from taking our woods. Of course. Let's just learn mathematics. Beindah. One, two, three, four five, six, seven. What is the answer? -Seven. -Right. Ma'am. I heard someone is giving birth. Yes, Mrs. Besuling is the one who's giving birth. I see. Is the place far? It's nearby. Really? You're the boy who helped our teacher? Which group do you belong to? If you want to learn, just come. What is your name? What is your Tumenggung's name? I'm from Makekal Downstream. My Tumenggung's name is Belaman Badai. My name is Nyungsang Bungo. The downstream disease has come here. Get it straight, Beindah. There are ten lines here. If I take three lines at the end, try to recalculate it. How many are left if I take three out of ten? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -Yes, great! -Great. This is ten minus three, what is the answer? This is ten minus three, what is the answer? Six! King of disease! You can't do it right! Teacher, this boy can't do it right! We have ten rubber seeds. If I take three of them, how many are left? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -Right! -Yes! -Great! -Great! Look here, Beindah. We've tried counting it together. -Now try to count it yourself. -Yes. Ten... -Ten minus three. -Yes. Ten... Eight! My goodness... How lame! King of disease! This kid sucks! Bungo visited me for a few times to observe me from a distance. But now, he doesn't anymore. He seems to want to get close. But at the same time, I know that he's being suspicious. Bungo must have come from a closed group among Rimba people. Hi, can we talk for a second? Yes? Do you remember I've submitted a proposal to teach in the downstream area of Makekal River once? Yes, but you've been there before, right? Yes. But only to help the health team. I haven't got the chance to teach. -I see. -I will see Gustav immediately -to take care of... -Wait, Butet. We still need to maintain our budget. Just focus on the children in the upstream area for now. I think there are still a lot of groups to be helped. Oh, right. The coverage from two weeks ago has received responses from Jakarta. All of them are positive feedbacks. We'll compile it later and make it a part of our progress report here. We will send everything to the donor. One more thing. Do you remember Dr. Astrid Hilde? The woman from Sweden, whom we assisted with her research here. The one who helped with our reports and you edited the translations. She is no longer a part of our project. So don't share any data with her. Okay? She won't come back here anymore. RIMBA PEOPLE AND THE EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES HER NAME IS SAUR MARLINA MANURUNG, A BATAK DESCENT RIMBA PEOPLE IS NOW A CONCERN BUTET DEVOTES HERSELF FOR ANAK DALAM TRIBE'S LITERACY THE TEACHER OF THE JUNGLE That coverage was exaggerated. As if we're the ones who know what's best and right. The news in yesterday's newspaper? Honestly, I'm still angry with Bahar, Dit. What's the purpose of showing this to the public? I can't face the Tumenggung now. The children had to pretend to study until night for this coverage. Even though they were really sleepy. But try seeing it like this. We're still able to continue because of the funding. Look. In order to enter the jungle, you need to ride a motorbike. It takes three hours to reach the border. After that, we have to stay there for at least 15 days. Who's going to pay for our logistics? Hey, you wanted to buy medicine, right? SABIRAN STORE Dit, isn't that Dr. Astrid? Over there! She had an argument with Bahar. I thought she already went home. International news. It is estimated at least 200 miners were killed by a flood when they were still inside the mine. In fact, the accident happened two weeks ago, but we only received the news just now. I can't hold back my curiosity about what Bungo really wants. He had walked the distance just to see the place where I teach at the upstream. I have to find a way to meet him. Yes, now they know. For example, there are two new letters. They can understand it right away. Like Nike or Ndrea. They've learned to count. I've only taught them one to ten so far. Then... Supposing there are several groups, for example, ten groups. One group is about 20 persons. -That's doable. -Or you can check first, which one is the most effective. We'll talk about it later. -So we can make small groups? -Yes. The first ten days, the second ten days, and the third ten days. Then check it every ten days, -and make no mistake. -Okay. When it's finished, report it to me before it's released. -Understood. -All right. I'll head to the district office first. I'll come back this afternoon, -and we can check it again. -Okay. Gustav. Two cups of coffee, please. More. -Teacher, how are you? -Hey, Berapit, Besiap. -I'm going there first, okay? -Okay. All right. -Beindah, Nengkabau. -We want to join you, Teacher. Why? Where do you want to go? We want to help. -Teacher, open it! -Teacher! Teacher, I've been practicing. Now I'm good at reading. Really? How do you spell deer? -D-E-E-R. Deer. -That's right. Great. Beindah, come down! I'll count to three! One, two... Beindah! How do you say, "A big bear is playing"? King of disease! I can't do that. Goodness! You startled me. Hat! Does anyone know where is the downstream? That way. Just go straight? It's this way. That way! I know the way well. -This way! -No! Makekal is that way! Don't ask too many questions. Just eat. Teacher, I like to eat animals, but I'm afraid of bears. Nengkabau, Beindah, eat. Let's eat. Teacher, let me take photos. -What do you want to capture? -I want to capture the damaged forest. -I want a photo of you, Teacher. -Sure. Nengkabau! Nengkabau! Nengkabau! Nengkabau! Beindah. Beindah. Beindah. Just cut it off. King of disease, illegal logger. Nengkabau. Nengkabau! Hey! Run! Nengkabau, run! King of disease! Why did you take photos of those evil illegal loggers? Dr. Astrid. Is that you, Butet? Is someone sick? A boy from Jambi. He's infected with malaria while traveling with me. He was healthy yesterday. I hear the Rimba people mentioning your name often. A lot of them love Teacher Butet. But Bahar, he... Maybe I'm too harsh on him. It's my job to be critical about every step taken by Wanaraya. I have my own research project. We can work together. But if there is something I don't approve, I must say it. The more I talk to people from the government and even NGOs, the more I'm disappointed. They don't see Rimba people from the right perspective. And also with pity. What is the basis? They refer Rimba people as stupid Kubu primitives. I think their sense of understanding towards the environment is better than us. In many ways, the Rimba people are more advanced than us. Where are you from, Butet? I mean, someone like you has many opportunities to work elsewhere. Why are you here? Actually, after graduating from college, I really didn't know what to do. And that time, I saw a really interesting job vacancy in Wanaraya. I thought this could be a very exotic adventure. Teaching in the jungle. Isn't that interesting? My mom permitted me. But maybe if... If my dad was still around, I wouldn't be here. Boyfriend? Boyfriend? Boyfriend... I used to have one. That man asked me to return to Jakarta in two years. Then we would get married, he said. I thought I'd go back to Jakarta in two years. I think they've found a friend in me. I also get along really well with them. -Eat! -Okay. -It's really tasty. I like it. -Yes. -I'm full. -I'm full. I admire them who base everything they do on love and sincerity. Like a lot of mountain climbers I know. Dr. Astrid always shows me the various wealth of Rimba people and the reason of their existence for the balance of this forest. The group of Belaman Badai? Where are we going? Behind that hill. Okay. Hello! Hello! Hello. Who is it? Anybody there? I'm Butet. I'm Teacher Butet from Makekal Upstream. I see. Tumenggung is not around. Yes. We will call Tumenggung later. Please wait. Okay. Consideration is needed to approach Rimba people's group for the first time. Sometimes, the open world is too overwhelming for them. I always try to feel whether my presence is desired or not. I'm sure this is Nyungsang Bungo's group. What is your purpose of coming here? I came from the upstream. I work for Wanaraya in Bangko. I study with the children at Makekal Upstream. What's your name? I'm Butet. The children share their stories with me so that they have other activities and not only playing around. Children love to share stories with me. This is Beindah. And that is Nengkabau. Both of them help me. You wait here. Okay. Beindah, Nengkabau. Help me set up a tent. I'm feeling a bit guilty this time. This is the first time I decided to proceed without official permission from my workplace. We have walked for five days from Makekal Upstream to here. Has any teacher ever came here? We also met illegal loggers far over there. Teacher, this is Pico, Nutul and Bedundang. They also want to study. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Teacher, you three may come to our place. ...G, H, I, J. A, B, C, D... Teacher, I'll help make a place for you to stay. Okay. -This is the letter... -Nutul. -A. -A. This is the letter -I. -I. -This is the letter U. -U. Then I add -B. -B. -B. -B. Then, B with A. -Ba. -Ba. -Two springs... -Home. -Three plus... -Three minus... Bungo, help Mom. Don't spend too much time there. I'm building a place for Teacher. What kind of a woman walking alone carrying a pencil. If you bring a pencil, many children will get sick. I don't want my child to study. If he studies he will go far away and never come back again. Teacher, we want to study. Nutul. -Try D. -D. -E. -E. -E. -E. -R. -R. Right. -Ba. -Ba. -J, A... -J, A... -Ja. -Ja. That's right. This is B with U. -Bu. -Bu. -Then J with... -Ma. -Ma. -A. Sir. Excuse me. Is the village chief around? -I want to meet him. -O. -B. -B. -Z. -Z. -Q. -Q. The tree from yesterday -hasn't got into your territory? -Which area? Over there. -Over there? -Yes. The one on the other end is our area. Teacher. This. The palm oil plantation used to be far outside. We have moved three times because the palm oil plantations keep getting deeper inside. What will happen if the forest becomes a National Park? Even bears aren't seen anymore. There were no such regulations back then. Now there's even a rule prohibiting us from hunting. We are not allowed to open a large field. Bungo's group is confused. Split by suspicions and inability to resist the pressure from the outside world. Even though they're still trying to be friendly in accepting certain groups who often approach them, that doesn't mean they feel comfortable. He only keeps studying. If he studies, that means changing our custom. He still can help his mom and dad. Bringing a book and a pencil means bringing a disease. But it actually has a good purpose. Let him do it. Someday, Bungo will go far away and won't come back again. Learning is good, let him do it! I don't want Bungo to study. Tell that person to leave! Let him study! Teacher. Teacher, look. I finally can write. That's correct, Bungo. Teacher, I want to try another word. Come here. Shall we try something more difficult? -Okay. -Good. Try writing turtle. -T with... -T-U-R. Tur. -Tur, right. Great. -Tur. -Then? -T-L-E. How do you read that? Turtle. Yes, great. Continue. Farmer. Farmer. Gustav! -Gustav! -Yes? Did Butet take more days? Almost 20 days? Yes. Yesterday, she was taken by the car to the last transmigrant settlement. I thought she already told you. -All costs are recorded and signed. -Yes, all right. It's been three days our hunting ended up with nothing. Teacher, I don't know how to explain it to you. In fact, attending school is against our customs. Bungo's mom and the great shaman believe in the story about pencils carrying disease. So, Teacher, please leave. You can't teach unless everyone welcomes you. In the end, we argued. So it's true that pencils bring disease. DEER, FEEL, BOOK, FLOWER, JUNGLE Where is she? Where is Teacher Butet? Why did she leave? I want to study with her. I want to be able to read. So the outsiders can't keep fooling us. I don't want to be a fool! Bungo, get back here! Butet, wake up. Let's eat first. Butet. Butet. You have to eat. Wake up. Come on, wake up. How long have I slept, Dit? Ten hours. Finish your meal. Then take your medicine again. Goal! DEER, FEEL, BOOK, FLOWER, JUNGLE I finally met the furthest group of the Rimba people. At the downstream of Makekal River. The group of Tumenggung Belaman Badai. They have moved several times due to the National Park zoning matter and the expansion of palm oil plantations. I met a boy named Bungo. He showed me a letter he couldn't read. None in his group could read. That paper was an agreement about logging in their customary territory. And they approved it by stamping their thumbprints on a letter they can't read. And the payment? Some cans of biscuits, sugar and cigarettes. Bungo took the agreement letter everywhere. As if he wanted to show me how much he wanted to be able to read and resist this fraud against the Rimba people. Butet. How is your condition? I've told Gustav to provide everything related to your health. But next time, if you want to go somewhere far, please write a report to me. Or at least, see me directly. Oh, right. Did you meet Astrid at the downstream? Butet. The priority of this organization is to maintain the National Park area. Thus far, it can be said that we've succeeded. -It's done. -Succeeded? -Done? -Yes. The National Park area has increased more than 30 percent. And for you, no humans are allowed to touch it, right? So, you think I don't care about those Rimba people? Why do think you're employed here? You are here to assist them. There are no problems so far, right? Look. Tumenggung Belaman Badai's group has moved several times because of the palm oil owner's interest. The place they live in has changed. They've hunted for three nights only to get one pig or one deer, or even nothing at all. Now they can't even open a field because burning a field means violating the law of National Park. Now they don't have the freedom to live on their own land. Bungo wants to study. -He wants to learn to-- -Bungo? So, this is solely about a kid named Bungo. Don't speak rubbish, Butet. What does this have to do with us? Tell me. Now try to think for yourself. Bungo showed us what we are here for. Makekal River divides the Bukit Duabelas forest. Truthfully, this National Park is surrounded by palm oil plantations. From the transmigrants who have been here since the 80s. Some of them often help our work. I remember one family from Central Java, who lives right on the forest border between the upstream and the downstream. Teacher Butet. It's been a long time since you last came here. Those who still come here to work are Dondi, Once, and what's his name? Rimba man who often assists the health team. Oh, right. And that foreign lady who's fluent in Indonesian. -Dr. Astrid. -Yes. My husband and my oldest child are escorting them into the forest. Maybe they'll come home tomorrow morning. Teacher Butet, what do you want to eat? So, when do you plan to go inside? Actually, I want to find more students in the downstream, ma'am. I've always wanted to come here a long time ago, but I couldn't find the right time. Two weeks ago, I came to Tumenggung Belaman Badai's place. But things ended up badly. I had to go out. Now I have no idea how to get inside. It's a pity, the children want to learn. You mean, you want to go back to teach in Tumenggung Belaman Badai's group? That's it. Every week, Rimba people from the downstream come here to enter the village looking for money. Tumenggung Belaman Badai's group definitely comes here. They like to sell resin here. Sometimes, they also bring rubber if there are some leftovers. They like shopping now. Shopping for sugar, -coffee, instant noodle... -Mrs. Pariyan. You mean, Tumenggung Belaman Badai's group often comes here? -Yes. -To this house? Yes. Mrs. Pariyan, can I teach here? Here? In this house? Sir! Yes? Now I teach at Mrs. Pariyan's house. If there are children who want to learn, ask them to come here! All right! Okay. I'll walk again. -Teacher! -Hi! Hey, now I teach at Mrs. Pariyan's house. If there are children who want to learn, ask them to go there. -All right, I'll go home first. -Okay. So, you guys have to tell Penangguk, Menosur and everyone else that now I teach -at Ms. Pariyan's house, okay? -Okay. So, you don't teach at the upstream anymore? Not yet, but you can join. Teacher, I want to learn mathematics again. Butet! Come on, Nengkabau will read. You guys have to help him remember if there are difficult words, okay? Come on, Nengkabau. "One day, someone in the field... Temporary field..." I have a field there. Other places, -but the place... Teacher, wake up. Muncang, isn't it? -Yes, ma'am. -I see. Hey. Do you want to leave resin? How much? Jang! So, those Rimba people are really funny. Sometimes they like to come here. They come to protest. They'd say that I don't give them enough money for the resin. But the following day, they'd come again to sell resin. They are weird, but basically good people. Penangguk, take the plate. Bungo. Let's study. Here, start learning again. Ten minus three. One, two, three, four, -five, six, seven. -Correct. That's great. Now, -ten minus five. -Six. -No! -He's the king of disease! K-U. Ku. Hi... Hike uphill. You greedy. Teacher, I want to eat more. King of disease! VEGETABLES, TOMATO, CARROT, PAPAYA Beindah. -Got it. We saw it fell here. King of disease! One, two. Yes. -Do you get this big tree in the picture? -Yes. Teacher, there is a tomb there. Teacher, have you seen someone climb a honey tree? I haven't seen it. My dad used to be a great honey tree climber. It all starts with a spell. Everyone must be ready. His heart must be free from all evil thoughts. A chosen man will put the stakes as the footing to the top to a tree branch where the honey is for the footing of others who will take the honey. The flaming wood is used when he arrives at the top. They climb up very high. Once they get to the top, it gets very dark, silent, and the wind blows hard there. Those men must have strong legs because they have to cling onto a honey tree branch. Pull up the honey tray! They keep reciting the spells so they won't be harmed by the wood ghost. At the top of the honey tree, there are many things we can find. But it depends on the state of our hearts. There are many beautiful visions and also the bad ones. My dad once told me that he saw glowing fishes swimming in between the branches. Both beautiful and bad visions bring the same harm. They lead us to carelessness until our feet slip from the footing. If we fall from a honey tree, it is not necessary to lift our body again. We are immediately buried in the ground. Bungo, have you ever climbed up a honey tree? No, I can't do it yet. But someday, I will have to face it. Are you coming again tomorrow? Yes, since I don't have anything to do. Is there work? There is, but it's hard. I don't want to work if it's hard. It's better to just stay home. The point is, we'll get some money. You better come if you don't have money. Please give me easier tasks. Have mercy on me. I'll be tired since I have a small build. You already have it easy. You don't want to attend school. What can I do? I have no money. But you ask for a huge payment. AGREEMENT LETTER "Agreement letter. Today, Friday, March 12, 1999. Present before me, Piar I.N. Kusnadi, based on the decree..." -That's enough. -To--" Just read this one. Just read this one, okay? AFTER THE RAIN "The next day, I returned to Wandi's house. And that's of course, by passing that small forest again. Mr. Gendut's yard looked quiet." What is ten minus two? -Eight. -Right. If I add two? Eight, nine, ten! The price for one kilogram of sweet potato is 2,000. If we buy half a kilogram, how much is it? -A thousand. -Correct. Give the money. SCHOOL, STUDY How do you read it? Bungo is in the middle of the changing Rimba society. Great! He wants to maintain his Rimba attitude and personality. But he begins to realize his rights at the same time. B-O. Bo. Ba. Hey, let's study. Like most of the Rimba children I've met, Bungo is exceptionally intelligent. He is now really good at reading. And he began to become my main cadre. -Eleven minus three? -Eight. -Twelve minus six? -Six. -Eight minus six? -Two. -Ten minus seven? -Three. So, ten minus three is? -Seven. -Is it true? Ten minus three? Yes, seven. -Teacher, this kid is now great. -Correct. Let's give him an applause. -Ma'am, do you have corn? -I do, over there. Bungo! Bungo! Go home! You never came home. You made things difficult for everyone. We were sent by your dad to pick you up. You have to go home! So, that we can carry out our customs. Your mom is angry. We believe in that curse. Don't you interfere! This is serious! Tumenggung died last night. She must be the cause! This is the curse for us, since we received knowledge from you. Bungo, let's go home! Teacher, I'm going home. Tumenggung's death is a turning point for Nyungsang Bungo. He had to go back and perform the tradition of Melangun. A journey to move until their aching grief is gone. A Melangun journey can go on for months, even years. This Melangun is also a turning point for me. The curse of knowledge is real. Butet, Bahar asked you to come to the office. That is the chronology, more or less. And once again, thank you for coming from far away. This is the one we've been waiting for. The hero of Rimba people's education, Butet Manurung. Butet, they are journalists from Medan and some came from Palembang, right? They want to cover how you teach the Rimba children. And I already told Gustav to prepare the vehicle and escort them into the forest. So you want me to put on another show like we did before? Butet! What's so hard about that? Just bring them inside. Just until the upstream will do. You only need to teach the children and they'll do the documentation. Everything I've done is like trying to show the world, the donors, that we genuinely care about the Rimba people. Everything you've done? Hey, what do you mean? Butet, if you can't approve how we work, then you don't belong here! Sorry. SABIRAN STORE -How much is this? -It's 40,000. -It's 40,000? I'll take one. -Okay. Give these to the children upstream, okay? Dondi, Once, where is Teacher Butet? There she is! Nengkabau. Here, drink more. How can I return there, Mom? You have a lot of things that will help you go back there. You have a great love for them. Miss. This is whom we've been waiting for. Someone who has dedicated herself to the education of the Rimba people, Butet Manurung! Actually, the Rimba people don't need us. They don't need anything from the bright world. But they are now compelled to participate in this current of development. Villages are getting closer to make them the target markets. Bringing new changes to their world. Even bringing new disease phenomenon. The Rimba people are facing a new reality. And of course, it is also reasonable for some of them to be tempted to come out from the jungle more frequently. I want to go back. I want to continue teaching these Rimba children. I want to give them a chance to not only learn how to read, write or count. But also to face life. A survival school that also introduces advocacy for their services and rights. We want to build our own school. Or sokola in the language of the Rimba people. We want to build it for them and also for the children from marginal communities in Indonesia. Because important education is the education that prepares them to face the pressure of changes. A FEW MONTHS LATER -Gustav? -Yes, Butet. Our friends have been waiting over there. I never expected -that aside from Andit, my best friend, -Butet. my other friends also support my decision to return. Everything is written there. We are glad to gather here in this familiar atmosphere. We respect Mr. Tumenggung, but we also need to expand this land. The limit is over there. You only need to draw a line. We only need a thumbprint from the chief now. Wait. We want to read it. We do not agree with article number three and five. Because it is written that the plantation company has the right to enter the deepest border. Let me read it first. "Article number three, the location of object of agreement. The location in question is the land controlled by Tumenggung's group that..." Bungo doesn't want to leave his community. "...the Makekal River with the wide..." But he also has motivation to be able to understand what the outsiders want from the place he lives in. "The period of extension for the utilization of this land..." Bungo reminds me of the right attitude to face changes. Bungo. Using knowledge as the weapon to adapt. SCHOOL I teach in this place. But actually, I am the one who learned a lot here. Let's count together. One, two, three. Three. SCHOOL SCHOOL THE END King of disease. Subtitle translation by Novailta Hardhiyani
