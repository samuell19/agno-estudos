THE OLD GUN Dog Marcel, dog Marcel... Waiting for his daddy, right? Marcel is a happy dog, right? Beautiful dog, the most beautiful, wonderful dog in the world, eh? Yes, yes. Explosion! - Are you afraid? - Yes... Like you, like you, dear. Yes? Doctor, wounded patient with burnt eyes is still screaming. I'm on my way. And no morphine left, of course! Give him a sedative, he needs sleep. Ah, gently. Here! Don't move. It's pointless. - It seems you don't like my visits. - There are only sick people here. I know, sick communists. Sick saboteurs even! It depends on the day? And on the night. Chief, we found him! - He has killed 2 of my men. - I am not a politician! That's what cowards say! In harsh times. I am not a politician. I treat the wounded. Either you leave him here or I go tell Major Doctor Müller! Mister Dandieu, the war is not over yet. Do you know what would happen if you were not a surgeon? I would have brought you to the Gestapo, and you would have been shot. Oh yes... I've had my eye on you for quite a while... You have a family... A wife, a daughter. In their own interest... be careful. Oh, no, no. No! Them, again! Don't let his happen, Müller. Mister Dandieu, I still have 125 wounded officers to evacuate. And I do not know how or where. Anyway, it is a problem between French. Is there any sulfamide left? No... There is nothing left. In a month or two you'll be free. Maybe you'll have penicilline, while me... They'll probably come back. For sure... What about the lung patient? - Which one? - The one that blew up the train in Paris. Oh yeah, this one... Another hero. I'm tired of these heroes! Bring him to the cellar near the boiler room. - He cannot be transported. - He can be transported... ...or else you don't know what you want! If they come back, they take him and they kill him. And they arrest us. - Who is it? - Dandieu. Here is the sulfamide, and 18 ampoules of morfine. That's all I could get. Better than nothing... Thank you. Good bye. Stop! Documents! It is forbidden to go out during the curfew. Do you have a safe-conduct? Please excuse us, Doctor. I was worried, mister Julien. Everything's fine, Jeanne. - I hope they didn't wait for me? - No, but I kept a dish for you. Thanks! But I'm not hungry. Go to bed, Jeanne. Thank you. How are things at the hospital? Oh, Marcel the dog! What a beautiful dog! The radio announces that in Normandie... ...the Germans cast off the Americans to the sea. And some people say that the Division Das Reich... ...is leaving Montauban to join the Normandie front. - And then... - Listen, mum, I'm tired. - Do you want a drink? - Yes, please. - I only have white wine left. - It'll do fine. Are you mad? - I didn't want to put that one. - Which one did you want to put? - This one, the double six. - She was right. Of course, you have all the sixes. You would have won the game. Check, I'm sure of it. - Oh no! - Damn! It is the second time! - I can't see a thing. And I'm carrying the wine. - Wait, madame Dandieu. Come on, Marcel, not now. Shut up. Do not panic. - Hurry! Help me! - What's that? Florence? Yes, she is the laundry room, taking a bath. - A bath? At this hour? - Yes! - What an idea... - Yes! My towel fell in the water! - I'm coming, dear... Thank you. - Thanks, Mom. - Wait a minute... I'm coming. - Wait for me, Clara. - I'm going... - No, stay here... I have something to tell you. - Clara! - Yes? - Clara. - Yes? I love you. - So what? Are you coming? - Yes! Yes, let's go. - Come on! - Yeah, come on, come on. - It stings, I have soap in my eyes. - Wait, wait. Wait, let's see... Come on, that's it, come on... Oh, no! Ah, I can't see either now! It's all over my glasses. - I didn't mean it. - I hope so. Marcel! - Look, I'm not needed here! - Well, yes, you are beautiful. - Where are your clothes? - In my bedroom. - You came own here naked? - Well, yes. My daughter lost her mind! My glasses! Wait, wait, wait... Get dry! Nobody cares about my glasses!. All I have to do myself. I'll take care of it! There you are, sir! Thank you very much... I go back to François. You go straight to bed. Good night. Do you hear them? Yes, glad the women are here, mum! It's getting late, I have to go. - Who's on call? - Besson and Thibodée. They're overloaded. They're expecting you. - I... Can I take your car? - Yes, of course. - Bood night, madam. - Good night. I had the saboteur hidden in the boiler room. - Why? - The militia paid us another visit. They found the young Drobée and took him away. I could not do anything. - I'm a little scared, François. - They're dangerous, you know. They realise that they're going down. So... They're getting mad. - Have they threatened you? - Yes... But that's not the problem. You know them... They mentionned my family. Do you understand? What could I do? I was stuck, I couldn't do anything. - Goodbye, Francois! - Goodbye, Francois. Bye. - They shouldn't stay here. - I know. And it's going to get worse until the end, you'll see. I forgot to tell you: there is a little sulfamide and morfine at the back. Very well. Listen, I can take them to La Barberie in the morning. No one will look for them there. I'll pick them up in the morning while you're in the hospital. I had thought about it but I didn't dare asking. Okay, tomorrow at 8 am... The sooner they leave, the better. - When will you sleep? - Oh, after the war! My first is syllabel is a fish, my second is a fruit tree... And all together they make great king of France. - It is not possible. - Of course it is... - Yes, it is... Parfaitement (''anchois'', ''pommier'') - You see... - François First! - How silly. No, this is true. - Al right everybody, it's late. - Sorry. - Can I borrow my wife. - When will I get her back? In the morning. I promise. - Night Marcel. - Sleep well, dear. - I don't have any matches. - No need of them to sleep. Look, Clara, tomorrow morning I'll send you all to La Barberie. Flo, Mum, Jeanne and you. - Why? - It's safer. François will drive you there. Is that so? For Flo, your mum and Jeanne, it's alright. But not me. - Of course it is. - No. Yes, it is, don't be stubborn In a few days, when the town is freed, I'll come and bring you back. And after that, we'll go for a great voyage, just you and me. The one we should have done if there hadn't been a war. And if you're very nice I'll make you a baby. Julien. The baby... Let's make it now! Right now! Don't move. I feels like bombing scares allies... Orleans in flames... Beaugency is on fire... Blois too. Everywhere ruins, broken windows... Ruined walls, debris... To the birds of Orléan must look like a skimmer... City riddled with craters from shells... The two towers of the cathedral are torn... "Poor France" - as would Philip say... So you're absolutely certain, you don't want to go? - No, dear. - What if the town is bombed? At our age, we don't risk anything. - See you later. - See you later. My mother is so stubborn. I never ask her anything. For once, this is important, and she doesn't want to hear about it. How come are we safer at La Barberie? Becaus, dear. - Do you have any money? - I've got all I need. Anyway, you know everybody in the village. No problem. Everything will be fine. Drop me a little further. See you tonight, François. And you, well, see you very soon. - I'll go to see you as soon as I can. - Alright. - Bye. - Bye. - Be good. - Yes, sir! I have no use of this scarf and your daughter needs a jumper. You're bored without Clara? You stayed to look after me? Do you know how long I adored your father? 30 years. Each time I open a door, I feel like I'm about to see him. He liked to read too. Strange... A skinny little man... ...who gave me a big boy like you. 11:30. François has to take his call. Let him sleep a little more. We're so well... Yes... We're so well. But there's the hospital. I heard that yesterday, you've operated for 8 hours in a row. When I'm too tired, I'm afraid to make a mistake. I'm not worried, with these hands you perform miracles. - Do you mind making coffee? - Of course not. Finally! It looks like the end. Quick, we must go behind the tanks! The partisans could cit off the road! What is that? Plum or pear brandy? - I think there's no name, sir. - No, it's petroleum. - It's a possibility. - Ah, Garigue... If he doesn't urinate at night, tomorrow we probe him and then open him, right? Look at that. That is the phenomenon! And yet, within a month, he be fine this little militian. Yes, he is saved. And ready for the firing squad. Yes, such a chance. Tough as he is, 12 more bullets won't get the better of him! Come in! Ah, miss Langrenier, How are you, miss Langrenier? - A shot? - No? A small one? - No, thank you. - No? Doctor. You've got rings under your eyes, miss Langrenier! Went to bed late, huh? Woman in ward 12... I think it's going to be twins. That's perfect! Two to go, two to come! Such balance... That's nature, miss Langrenier. Goodbye, miss Langrenier. Nice piece of ass, miss Langrenier. - Is she good in bed? - Oh yes, sir. Good for her... ...because for the injections I've seen better! Well, everyone, you've been great. I suppose you all have other fish to fry. See you tomorrow. So, what do we have left? Ah, the amputation? - If you want, I'll take care of it. - Yes, it suits me. You see, they've been gone for 5 days and 5 nights. If at least they had a phone. I can't stand it anymore. You know, I've noticed. If you left now, you could be there for lunch. And then could be back for 5pm. - Do you think so? - Don't you? Yes, of course. You're right. Let's go. Yes, I'll go. Halt! Papers! Let him through. Stop! What are you doing here? Come here! Monsieur Florent? Monsieur Florent? Yvonne? Is there anybody here? - Ludwig! - Yes, Obersturmführer. Try again to reach the headquarters. - Ask them if they're coming or not. - Yes, sir! One day, I'll be old and you will have not really looked at me. How dare you? You're wrong. That's all I'm doing! You're watching me, spying on me, that's different. You're wrong, I'm telling you. You've got nerves. I deprive myself of sleeping to watch you sleep! - Liar! - What do you mean, liar? - Not every night. - No, not every night. - There you go. - Will you forgive me? What if I don't? - Looking for something? - No, no... Hello... How are you? - Madame Jeanne! Have you seen my wife? - She was on her way to the cellar. What's wrong? What happened? Nothing. I don't know. You don't want to tell me? - Someone hurt you? - No... No, no. So what? I don't know... I got sad, all of a sudden. Why sad? Don't know why... I got scared. - Scared of what? - I don't know. I just... I was hurt. It is over. - Over? - Yes, it's over. Maybe it's because I drank too much. I... I'm a little too happy. - I guess that's the point, right? - Yes, probably. Do you understand? You see, Julien? That is buckshot. From headquarters in Montauban. Is there an answer? No answer. The Colonel has been killed. No one from general staff is covering up for us. No one will find out. We have to catch up with our unit in Périgueux. And from there, the Normandie front. About the village, we'll say that a group of Partisans has attacked us. Until the end of the war... I found a film projector. I have the same in Munich. Turn off the light. Come on. Biarritz, the summer of 1939. Don't you ever dance? - I do not know how. - What a pity. - I'm sorry. - We could have flirted? I do not know how. I wish they'd never stop playing. They are going to play all night. So you'll hear them just as well from your bed. To bed, miss big bundle. Come on, take off your glasses... That's it. What is it? Is there something wrong? Are you unhappy? - Yes... Why mom left you? - It's quite a story. Because she met another man. He was very handsome so she loved him. And left with him. That's all I can tell you. But it is not sad, you know, because she is very happy... ...and me too, because I have you. What about Clara? You like her, don't you? Yes. She is like my sister. It's as if you had two daughters. Good night, pumpkin. Well, go to sleep. And Clara will come to wish me good night? - Did she ever forget? - No. Well. Dad, when is your next leave? Very soon... I promise you. Come on, go to sleep, miss big bundle. - Is he courting you again? - Yes. - How do you feel about it? - It is very pleasant. Yeah? Really? Yes. Are you jealous? Bloody pipes. Fucking country! Fucking war! Get out of the way, drunk! What kind of sloppiness is this, Wake up immediately! Attention! From now on, the vehicles must be guarded around the clock! There may be partisans! And check out the engines! - Yes, Herr Major. - And look there for him! At last you! Prize of religious instruction, miss Bézac. Let all the pupils of 5A class who will hear their name... ...come here with us! Miss Dandieu, awarded 7 times, nominated twice. Congratulations. Miss Lenqueteau... ...awarded twice, nominated once. Too late... It's just over! Sorry dear, I was on time, was I not? I didn't sleep at the hospital, but we got a flat tire. - Really? - Look at my hands... ...full of dust and dirty grease. Look, see? Let's go, go, go! When I wanted to find the gloves, your mother had used them... ...to cut the roses or something. Look, Julien, enough about his hands. Look, Award for Excellence! - And History! - History too? Yes. Oh! Oh, Cyrano de Bergerac, that's my youth! "Prince, ask for forgiveness from God". "I take a step back, start to squabble," "Cut down, do a deceptive move, fight." "Pray prince! End of waiting for you". - Oh, I'm sorry, sister. - You look cheerful, Doctor. Well yes, sister Amelia, it's celebration day! Ah, our Julien... Good day... Good afternoon, sir. Thank you very much. Cheers! Well, all normal? We eat a little bit? So... Op, op... More? Herman! Get this dunghill to start! Speed up the leaving! It's taking too long! Hurry! Faster! Bring all provisions down. We will ship on the vehicles. Come on, come on! Move! - Fill all water containers. - Yes, sir. Friedrich disappeared, Lieutenant! - He was standing right there! - Idiot! You want to follow him? Get in the armored car! Friedrich is dead. There must be partisans down there. This is one of our units. They're leaving. Try to reach them. Listen... Ludwig! The bridge is broken! The partisans are surrounding us! Fall back! Close the gate! Beware! He ​​is in the window! Take one alive, for interrogation! Two in the basement... The others to the living room. Here! He ​​is here! Here! Here! Damn! There he is! Now we'll get him! In the other direction! - We have been through here. - He's in the well! Let's go this way.! Partisan, follow me to the castle! The Hauptsturmführer wants to talk to you. Come on! Hurry! Turn around! Go to the door! Fast! Fast! Fast! Fast! More partisans...... Hide! Complete silence. Shoot only on my command. Anybody there? Search the houses. Luc, come with me. This is incredible. They weren't signaled on any road. - They are probobly still in the castle. - Chief! Look. It's Doctor Dandieu. What are you doing here? - Are you alone? - Yes. - And your family? - They are in town. I got here after... Nothing could be done. - When I saw them, I hid. - When did they leave? - How many of them? - A dozen... - They took the road to... - Chief! I found a dead one! They must have fought back. Do you want to come with us? - No, thank you. - That's not very reasonable. And it can be dangerous, they may come back. Anyway, as you wish. You won't be alone for long... ...I'll tell the people from Mauricot. Two people in a tank! Point the gun at the entrance! The other, on the cliff! Here, tie the rope. Yes, Haubtsturmführer. Wolfgang, get down first! Julien... the child... Wouldn't you like to make him now? If it's a boy, we'll name him David. Partisans surround us! Threw grenades! We're trapped... The partisans are surrounding us. Boys, the game is over. Our comrades are probably too far away. We'll never... We'll never see Germany again. All we have left to do, to sell dearly our skin. - For the Führer! And for Fatherland! - Heil Hitler! Again propaganda by the Soviet-Jew radio... Not a word about the suffering, not a word about the displaced populations... ...people of Normandy, driven from their homes... ... and you, thousands of innocent missing or dead... ...and you who will soon discover the "joys" of the Liberation... What the hell is she doing? She could have told us! She probably didn't want to drive at night? - She'll be here in the morning. - It is the morning.... It is tomorrow morning... Don't be silly. 5:30 a.m. It's not the morning yet. Don't get smart. Yes, you're right... You know, Francois... What? She is so alive, so unpredictable. You know that. Everything has happened so fast, between us... I'm always scared that one day she might leave. As they say, you can not have everything. No. That's why you love her! What happened? A big detour and then I got lost. - Really? - Yes. - Good day! - Good afternoon. Don't be mad at me, I have a surprise for you. Peek-a-boo! What is she doing here? Why aren't you at school? - It's closed. - They requisition... We saw so many refugees on the road... Hello. - Hello... He was getting mad without you. - Why? And that's not all. - Look! - What is it? - That is Marcel. - We've named him Marcel. - Where does he come from, Marcel? - He was lying all alone on the road... So I stopped... we looked at each other and he got in. Come, Marcel. I've found an exit! Haubtsturmführer! Haubtsturmführer! Partisan! Aaah! A partisan! A partisan! There, in the bedroom. Quickly to the library! Turn everything upside down! Here is another room. He can't have just vanished into thin air! He's here, they're here, I'm sure of it! Good evening... Yes, thank you. Good evening... Good evening. - My friend Julien. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Clara. - Have a seat. - No, no, thank you, all right. Excuse me... I need to make a phone call. - I am very thirsty. - What do you want? - A glass of champagne, if you can. - Two, please. - What do you do for a living? - I'm a surgeon, like François. And I live in the country, like François. All like François. But, I don't know him that well, you know. Which region? In the South... Down, right, and down again. It's called Le Quercy. I also have a castle, a sort of castle, anyway. I am restoring it. Whenever I have the time. That's good. - What do you do? - Me? Nothing. - Nothing at all? - No. Anyway, I'm trying. It's not easy. Thank you. Thank you. - To you. - To you. - Are you rich? - No, not at all. I work now and then, when I'm broke. I help a friend who owns a bookshop. I used to make costume jewelry for a fashion designer. And then. Why? Are you interested? - What? - I don't know, me? - Why are you looking at me like that? - I love you. - You're crazy! - No. And now... You still love me. Am I right? Or is it over? For me, it's over. Not because you're not handsome. It has nothing to do with it. Everything was very nice... ...but I do not like men to whom I give myself right away... I don't like that. That's not your fault. It's mine. There was a misunderstanding... I'm sorry. You're already back to your province? Clara... The news are bad, I really think... ...there's going to be a war. - I don't give a damn. - Do you want to marry me? Where's Walter? He was here a minute ago. Hurry up! Walter? Are you trying to escape dressed as a civilian? Deserter! Dirty pig! Claus! Gunther! Claus! Gunther! Go! Hurry! Here, here! Damn! What is it? What is it? Water! Water! Help! The water rises! Are you okay? What happened to the dog? Marcel, the dog... Nothing. Clara must have taken him in her car. Are you coming for dinner tonight? What's wrong? If you want... I could be replaced at the hospital. And stay with you for a few days. Yes, if you want. Clara likes it when you come to visit us. - Julien... - What? - But... - What is it? What have I... What...
