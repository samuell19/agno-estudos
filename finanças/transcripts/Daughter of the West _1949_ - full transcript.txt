[music playing] Father Viejo, may I disturb your meditation? Certainly, Mother Lucretia. Our Lolita is leaving us within the hour. Yes, I know, good mother. Seems ironical she shouldhave chosen to teach school on an Indian reservation. Perhaps it is God's will. She has Indian blood in her, you know. Do you intend to tell herthat her mother was Ramona? No, good mother, I dare not. Because some person might remember that Ramona was part Indian and subject Lolita to unnecessary humiliation. Heaven forbid. Here she comes. I'm going to leave you alone with her, Father. Good morning, Father. Good morning, my child. Father, when I think of going away, I become so terribly frightened. Why should you be frightened? Are you afraid you mightfail to be a good teacher? No, Father. It's because I'll be leavingyou and Mother Lucretia. But you'll only be leavingus for a little while, to bring enlightenment to the Indian children, and through them to their parents. Yes, Father. Bless you, my child. Your mother would have been proud of you. You were my mother'sdearest friend, weren't you? Yes. That's why she sent you to me. This cross was hers. She asked that I give it to you whenever you began to face life on your own. I'll wear it always. Father Yale, Sister Teresa has sighted the coach on the hilltop. Goodbye, Father. Bless you, my child. Goodbye, Mother Lucretia. Goodbye, Lolita. Goodbye. Don't forget to write, Lolita. I won't, Sister Teresa. Goodbye. Goodbye. Navajo juction. This is where you get off, Miss. Are you sure this is the right place? Close as I come to the reservation. Was there someone to meet you, Miss? I hope so. Guess they're late. I hope Fort Defiance isn't like this. Say, since you're going there, you take this package in with you? Name's on it. Certainly. Thank you, Miss. All aboard. Bye. I'm certainly glad you came. Warm, isn't it? You'll get used to it, Miss. These are my trunks. They are? Yes. Pardon me, Miss, but wassomeone supposed to meet you? Quite certainly. I'm going to the reservation. Weren't you to come for me? No, Miss, I'm sorry. I came for this package. Oh, well then, you'll see thatit gets to its right owner. Yes, of course. I'll be glad to give you a lift. That is, if you don'tmind riding in the wagon. Thank you. I'll be glad to pay you anything. That won't be necessary. Navo White Eagle, Navajo Indian Reservation Fort Defiance, from Carlisle IndianSchool, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Carlisle, how interesting. Do you know Navo White Eagle? Yes. I'd like to meet him. Why? Well, you see, I'm a schoolteacher and we might have something in common. I'm sure we-- I'm sure you would. Do you mind? Wait a minute, that's against the law! But that's to be deliveredto Navo White Eagle. It was. Oh, then-- then you're-- Navo White Eagle. I'm a Navajo. I just returned from Carlisle yesterday. Well, you're one Navajo I won'thave to teach, Mr. White Eagle. For your information, Miss, it's a tribal custom to call everyone but the chiefs by their given names. Oh, all right, Navo. And I'm Lolita, Lolita Moreno. Well, look who Navo brought back with him. Don't tell me you broughta bride to the reservation. No, this is Miss Moreno, the new schoolteacher. Lolita, this in Mr. and Mrs. Banks, who run the trading post. Howdy do? My dear, I'm simply delighted to meet you. And I thought that you were an Indian. You'll forgive me, won't you? There is nothing to forgive. I have much respect for the Indians. Well, so do we. But most white girls objectto living in dirt houses and being called a squaw. Oh, no offense to Navo. He's different. He's and educated Indian. Where shall I put Miss Moreno's trunks? Put them in the spare room, please. Oh, Navo, would you alsobring in those bolts yardage you picked up for us? Yes, ma'am. Won't you come in, my dear? Someday when you have time, Navo, I'd like you to show me around the reservation. Yes, Lolita. Hey! Very good, I'll take that one. Yes, Mr. Connors. Oh, Mr. Connors, this is Miss Moreno, the new teacher you engaged. Mr. Connors is in charge of the Indian agency. The pleasure is mine, Miss Moreno. The Navajos can considerthemselves fortunate in getting such a charming schoolmarm. Thank you, sir. I shall try very hard to please everyone. I'm sure you will. I'm sorry, we thoughtyou were coming tomorrow. I could have spared you sucha long, hot ride with only an Indian for company. On the contrary. I enjoyed every moment of the ride, especially Navo's interesting tales of thegovernment school at Carlisle. I've heard so much about his accomplishments. I met him for just a moment yesterday. You see, I was appointed agent here while he was away at school. I'm sure you'll find him worthy of respect. Now, if, uh, you'll excuse me, please. Why certainly. Come, my dear. Pretty little filly, eh? Yes siree, and curvedin the right places, too. Yeah. Hello, Navo. Morning, Mr. Connors. Sorry we couldn't havemore of a powwow yesterday. You must spend an evening with me soon and advise me on how to improve conditions for your people. It would be a pleasure tohelp you in every way I can. Thank you. Okeema, you change since Navo come home. I haven't seen Navo. But you will. He's been too busy to see Okeema. Good. You belong Yuba. Yuba show you. Soon as I finish stuff forConnors, I come back for you. Navo! Well, my little brother. And how's our mother, huh? Oh, very happy since you come home. I go run errand for her now. They say new white girl here, and very pretty. What does white want on Indian reservation? She's to be your school teacher. Panka not going to school anymore. Oh, yes you are, so that when you grow up you'll have a chance to go to Carlisle, too. Panka make up his mind when he see teacher. All right, run along. And don't be long. Panka run fast like antelope. All right, hup, hup, hup! Panka! Come here! Where you going? Run errand, then home. Navo back? Yes. Wait. Rustic bridge? Tell Navo meet me there right away. Maybe. And don't you forget. Hello, mother. My big brave son. Me see you make good trip. Yes. You think him good man? I hope so. You talk your plan with him? Not yet, but I'm going to. You see Okeema? I've been too busy to seeChief Wykomas's daughter. Yuba not too busy. [inaudible] Well, I think I better feed the horses. Whoa. So you see, with Mr. Connor's help, we can someday enjoy our reservation. White Eagle, your father be proud. Oh, I almost forgot. There's a new schoolteacheron the reservation. So? Very well-educated. And pretty? Beautiful. What her name? Lolita. Lolita Moreno. White girl. Be careful. You sit with Chief Wykomasin counsel tomorrow. You rest now. Navo can't rest yet, Mother. Why? Because Okeema wait for him at rustic bridge. She just told me to tell him. Well, I better not keep ourchief's daughter waiting. No. She can make much trouble. She been meeting you by bridge. Panka! It's a conspiracy. I won't be long. Navo! Okeema, well, my little friendis grown in the last year. And I've learned some ofthe things white folks do. I've been wondering what itwould be like to kiss you. And, uh, have you found out? Yes, it was very nice,and I want to do it again. Wait a minute. Kissing isn't just a game, youknow, to be played for fun. Okeema Hello, Yuba. So, Indian of much learningback on reservation. If you think white man way better than our, why don't you stay there? My place is here. You go away before you get in trouble. Trouble? How? Okeema my woman now. Ah, you're drunk. That lie. Are you bringing whiskeyon the reservation again? That none your business! I'll make it my business if you don't stop breaking federal law. Hey, Ralph! Mr. Connors? Ah. I thought it was somebody,instead of a stinking Indian. What's the matter with you? Tongue tied? No. Well, you can do something besides grunt. I've got more sense than toget drunk like a white miner. What makes you think I'm a miner? That pick and shovel on the pack burro outside. They're yours, aren't they? Yeah. Smart boy. Hey, come on Indian, pull off my boots. Pull off your own boots. I told-- Pull off my boots! I'll teach you to respect a white man. Now, come here, Indian. Maybe you don't know it, mister, but striking an Indian on a reservation is a federal offense. What's been going on here, Navo? He hit me with his whip becauseI wouldn't pull his boots off. I guess he had one too many. That crazy fool. I'm sorry, Navo. He must have gotten into mymedical supply while I was out. I'm sorry, Mr. Connors, it wasn't your fault. I know, I know. But he's my guest. He had no right to takeadvantage of my friendship. He's a good enough sort when he's sober. You leave this alone, Navo. I want to talk to Mr. Morgan. Sure, Mr. Connors. Welcome back to the reservation, Mr. Morgan. What happened? What happened. You would get into a fightthe first day you get back. I'll kill the Indian. And get us both thrownout of Arizona territory? You'll be a nice boy, or we're parting company. I thought you were a friend of mine. I am, but I'm not lettingfriendship spoil my future. You'd no right to whip him. First chance you get, youmake it up to him, see? All right. Get me another drink so Ican pull myself together. Howdy, Yuba. Well? Indian council soon makeNavo spokesman for tribe. Yeah? How do you know? Okeema at trading post tell me. What else did you find out? Hello, Navo. Good morning, Lolita. What's the matter with your arm? Nothing, just a little bruise. Let me see it. Just a little bruise? You better let me take care of it. Very well, Miss. That'll be all, Yuba. Now then, did you find thatcopper load I told you about? Did I. Wait till you see theore samples I brought back. Go on, open it. [whistles] Why, there's enoughcopper in this reservation to make us both rich. But we've got to play ourcards carefully, meaning-- From now on I don't do any moredrinking on the reservation. Right. Now let's take a look at this map. I figure the principal copper vein extends from about here-- about there Yeah. That's a strip 20 mileslong, about five miles wide. Why, it'll take a hundred yearsto get that much copper out of the ground. Yeah, but how do we go about getting it? I'm going to check the recordsand find out which Indians own those precious acres. And then? We take whatever steps arenecessary to get title to 'em. After that, we sell out to abig New York mining syndicate. No. Oh, here's a pretty one. And Mr. Connors couldn'thave been more understanding. He allowed me everything I asked for the school. That was nice of him. Who is pretty white girl with Navo? She's Lolita Moreno, the new schoolteacher. While I was at the governmentschool, Chief Wykomas, I learned why the white man is our superior. Why? It's because he is educated. He knows how to take a small stream of water and carry it for miles tobarren lands like ours, so that food will grow. He can make machines to thresh the grain. The hope of our people education and progress. If we want our white brothersto live up to their promises, we must win their trust and respect. The Navajo Tribe must nolonger depend on charity. Your words wise, Navo. But how much you do withouthelp of Indian agent. Very little. But I've already met Agent Connors, and he wants to talk to me aboutwhat to do and the best way to do it. If he fail us? Then with your permissionI shall go to Washington. Good. Navo White Eagle, it is will of council you be made member andspokesman for our people. I'm on it, Chief Wykomas, and I pledge my life to the betterment of our people. Why, if I with the help of the great spirit, our tribe will harvestlemons and other fruit trees, which are food and medicine. Good medicine? Yes, good medicine. Fruit juices will help preventblindness among our people. [bell ringing] That's all, children. School is dismissed. Miss Lolita? Yes? Love charm for teacher. Why, thank you. Goodbye. This is the one, Mr. Connors. My first name is Ralph. That's the right place for it. All right, Lolita. Hello, Lolita. Oh, I'm sorry, I-- I didn'trealize you were busy. Oh, no, Navo. Mr. Connors was just helpingme hang some pictures. Howdy, Navo. Hello, Mr. Connors. I save a few trees for the school yard. Will you show me where you'd like them planted? I'd love to. Excuse me, Mr. Connors. Certainly. Navo, this is a wonderful idea. But how will you water them? I'll carry water to them, the same as we did with these shrubs until I can include the school groundsin our irrigation system. Then we'll be able to-- why, Mother. Navo. Lolita, this is my mother, Wateeka. This is Lolita Moreno. I'm very happy to meet you. Navo speak much of you and your good work. Thank you. My mother does beautiful weaving. Won't you come see it sometime? I'd love to. And my brother, Panka,he draws, also, eh Mother? Why you not come eat some night? I'd be delighted. You come sooner. Mhmm. No be late, Navo. I won't, Mother. Your mother's nice. Thank you, Lolita. Well, where would you like them planted? Over there. All right. Hey, I've read this Navajotreaty three times now, and there's nothing in here that says an Indian can't sell his land allotment, except if he's under age. Good. Now, I'll give you the legaldescription to the land, and you can tell me who ownsthe title to our copper. With the greatest of pleasure, my friend. Ready? The north half of Section 5. North half of Section 5 iscovered by allotment number 1042, and is recorded in the name of Okeema, daughter of Chief Wykomas. Looks to me like you've been caught in the wrong [inaudible]. Oh, no. But watch me start courtingthe Indian gal for copper. Now don't get careless, Mr. Romeo. I'll be careful, Jeb. I'll play one against the other. Hmm? Okeema is stuck on Navo, isn't she? Yeah. And he's making calf eyes at Lolita. Catch on? Ah, huh, ah. Hide these papers. Hello, Navo. Come in. Thank you, sir. If you're not too busy, there's something I'd like to discuss with you. Never too busy to talk to you, my friend. Come on in here. Thanks. Howdy, Navo. Hello, Mr. Morgan. Say, Ralph and I were out thisafternoon looking at the crops. We've never seen any better. Well, thanks to Mr. Connors forgetting me the kind of seed I requested. Ah, the credit's all yours, Navo, for reclaiming those badlands. Pull up a chair and tell me what's on your mind. Well, as you know, my biggest dream is to make my people self-supporting. But I'm afraid you can't make a promise out of a race of hunters, because not every Indian will take to farming. You're quite right, Navo. And I suppose you've figuredout a way to do it, huh? Ha, no sir. Not me. The way was provided by the Great Spirit, millions of years ago. While at Carlisle, they taught me how to study soil and rock formations. You mean you've studied mineralogy? Oh, just some of the fundamentals, which were included in our geology course, but enough to know that the Navajo mountains are full of copper. Is that so? You don't say. Course, I only made a rough survey, but I'm confident that with proper development, there'll be independence and security for Navajos for years to come. Well, of course it'll takemillions to develop mines, but fortunately for all concerned, I have several good connections with one of the finest financialinstitutions on Wall Street. And we can operate throughthe Department of the Interior so that everything will be above board. I knew I could depend upon you Mr. Connors. And I'm sure my peoplewill be more than grateful. However, it might be a good idea, Navo, to keep this quiet untilour plans are fully developed. That makes sense. Well, goodnight, Mr. Morgan. Goodnight, Navo. Goodnight, Navo. I never did think it was such a smart idea to educate the Indians. You don't think I'm goingto let one Indian cheat us out of that copper, do you? No. And you got to get rid ofhim before it's too late. Right. But no violence, except as a last resort. Okeema, what are you doing here? Waiting for you, wondering why you've been a stranger to Okeema. I've been very busy workingso that there'll be food for our people this winter. What will you do after the harvest? Then I'll go into the mountainsand work for our tribe. Okeema wonders when you will build hogan for us. Patience has always been avirtue of the Navajo women, but not with Okeema. You say that because you inlove with white schoolteacher. That's not true. Education has made a fool of Navo. White girl won't live in Indian hogan. I'll never ask her to. But that is what you dream. For shame, Navo. Your dreams are no longerthe dreams of a Navajo. Don't go, Okeema. I want to talk to you. What do you want to talk about? About you. Me? Yes. The daughter of a big chief shouldn't be sad because an Indian youth is too blind to see how lovely she is. Lovely? I think you're beautiful. Do you mean what you say? Come to my office tonight and see the present I bought for you. What did you buy for me? Oh, no, you'll have tocome and see for yourself. You are fooling me. Am I? [music playing] Okeema. Okeema! Come here. Have you Okeema's present? Oh, yes. But first I want to show you something. See that? Mhm. What does it say? That says "United States Indian Service." Now, watch this. See that? Mhm. That says Ralph Connors, everytime I make my thumbprint. Now, I'll show you how to say Okeema. That's it. Now try it again. That's the way. Once more. Now, see if you can do it. Okeema. That's right. Okeema. Now then-- Okeema. Close your eyes and don't openthem until I tell you to look. Now you can look. [gasp] It's the prettiestnecklace Okeema's ever seen. Okeema thanks you very much. Okeema. Okeema. No, thank you. The dinner was delicious. It was so nice of you to invite me. Glad you come. If you think this was agood, wait until the harvest, eh, Mother? Yes, and school will be out then. Yes, and you'll be working in the field. [thunder] What's the matter, Mother? It isn't like you to beafraid of a little lightning and thunder. Wateeka not afraid. Me feel evil spirit. Me feel evil spirit long time now. Last night blood on moon. Well, it might rain. I think I better cover the farm equipment. Excuse me. Come on, Panka. Panka! Oh, sure. That pretty cross. It was my mother's. She and my father died when I was a baby. I was brought up at the Mission Capistrano. Long time ago, me see same cross like this. San Diego Mission,California, a pretty girl, eyes blue, just married. My mother and father weremarried at the Mission San Diego, and she had blue eyes. Do you suppose it was them you saw? Me not know. He call her Mahela. Mahela was my mother's name. Tell me everything you know about her, please. I know only that she wasbeautiful, modest, gracious, kind, and that my father was aSpaniard, a handsome Spaniard. Your father's name Moreno, eh? Yes. Then me not see your mother. But you seemed so sure at first. What made you change your mind? Girl I see married Indian. Oh. During the harvest Ishall go see Father Viejo. Look, Ralph, I'm getting tired of laying around and waiting and waiting. What are you going to do now? You're not a very patient man, Jeb. Yeah, but-- Well, Navo, congratulations. You're doing a fine job with the harvest. Thanks. But I sure wish we could get that new farm equipment from Fort Defiance. Can the Indian agency afford it? I don't know, Navo. We certainly need it, Mr. Connors. I know you do. But we used up most of our funds. All right, Navo. I'll get the papers readyand you can leave right away. That's fine. I'll see you in the office. What's the idea? While he's gone we'llarrange for harvest festival. And while the Indiansare having their powwow-- We'll help them celebrate. Father Viejo, what sortof a person was my mother? One of the finest and lowblessed women I've ever known. You told me her name was Mahela, didn't you? That is what your step father called her. But that wasn't her real given name, was it? No. Her real name was Ramona. Why did you conceal the truth from me? Only because I loved you,and wanted to protect you. Protect me from what? Was there something shamefulabout the union of my parents? No, no, no, my child. It was perfect. But it ended in tragedy, becauseyour father was an Indian. That was why I never toldyou your mother was Ramona, because she was part Indian, too. Oh, Father, I'm so happy. God's will be done. Look, smoke! Navo come. Connors, smoke signal in sky. Navo come. I thought you sent him to Fort Defiance for some farm equipment. I did, but I didn't expecthim back until later. Get the wagon. As soon as it gets dark, takethese chiefs out of here. And don't leave any bottles around. This is the last one, Jeb. You take over. I've got to go and welcome Navo. All right. Put these land titletransfers back in the safe. Much obliged, chief. [singing] Whoa. Giddap! Hello, Ralph. Okeema. Navo, Navo. Navo! Who's responsible for all this? Why, I am. I arranged it in your honor. We've invited some of the neighboring tribes. I know you meant well, Mr. Connors, but don't you realizeyou'll undo everything I've worked months to accomplish? I don't understand. Indians are like children. They'd so much rather play than work. Navo is an educated Indian Mr. Connors. But you can't changecenturies of Navajo culture with a store shirt and corduroy trousers. I'm aware of that fact. They seem to be delaying the powwow. I-- I'm supposed to make a speech about you. Go ahead, but please make it short. Friends and Navajos, the Navajotribe is giving this powwow to honor you, Navo, for the bountiful harvest you've made possible with your knowledge. And on behalf of the IndianBureau in Washington, I want to compliment you forthe fine work you've done. Thank you, sir. Hello, Navo. Hello, Lolita. You should be very happy. Should I? What's the matter? Don't you like my costume? Don't you think there are enough Indians on the reservation without you masquerading as one? But I'm not masquerading. You see I-- Come, Navo! [inaudible] is going to sing. [SINGING] The autumnmoon was shining brightly through the willow tree. The autumn moon had promisedit would bring my love to me. I'm hoping that when I sitthrough the willow tree the autumn moon will bring my love to me. Navo, Navo, come quick. Yuba's got chiefs drunkand putting them in wagon. Where did you see this? Back in Mr. Connor's office. -Excuse me, Lolita. -What's wrong? You wait here. I'll tell you later. Where you going, Yuba? Put wagon away. Where are you taking the chiefs? You choke me. What's going on here? Look in the wagon, Mr. Connors. I'd like to know wherehe was taking the chiefs. He wouldn't tell me. Oh, he'll tell me, or he'llrot in the reservation jail. Panka, take the chiefs to their home. Yes, Navo. I'm not blaming you, but I gotta make it look that way, understand? Yeah. Now where were you taking the chiefs? To hogans. I want the truth. I tell truth. No you don't. But maybe you will after youto spend some time in jail. Morgan. -Yeah? -Here's the key. Lock him up. Then come back to my office. Get going. I'll take care of this, Navo. Thanks, Mr. Connors. Lolita. So I'm really not blaming Yuba. I'm sure he was acting under somebody's orders. You don't mean Mr. Connors? Yeah, I'd hate to think so. Could be Morgan. You'll be careful, won't you. Connors wants you to ride to Fort Defiance and stay there till he gets rid of Navo. Good. [gunshot] What's that? I'll find out. I did exactly as you told me. That should do it, all right. Yuba. Couldn't make him talk, so you shot him, huh? I didn't kill him. He couldn't, because he was with me! Yes he did. Okeema! I saw him. That's not true, and you know it. It is true. And I hope you're punishedby the white man's law. She's right. I saw him, too. Under the circumstances, Navo, I'm afraid I'll have to arrest you. Come along. Lolita. I brought you something. Thanks, I'm not hungry. Maybe you'll eat it later. Maybe. You're tired. You didn't sleep last night, did you? Neither did I. Lolita, I can't understand it. You mean Okeema? No, no, not Okeema. I can understand how she's jealous. But Morgan-- Could it be because you once had a fight? No, there's more to it than that. Even Connors is turned against me. You're the only white friend I have left. Then Navo, I'm afraidyou have no white friends. What do you mean? Remember when I went to Father Viejo? Yes. Well, he finally told me my real ancestry. I'm an Indian, too. Please, be patient. Have faith. Everything's going to be all right. I'll be back. Yes, Lolita. Navo, spokesman for tribe, council wish he be tried Indian law. Well, it's not the usualprocedure, Chief Wykomas, however, as Indian agent of this reservation, I'll make an exception in thiscase and turn him over to you. Because I know you'll be just. Indian council always just. I thought you were turningNavo over to a military court. A court marshal would never be able to prove that Navo carried a gun. That was my mistake, Jeb. I should have told you to use a knife. Then we won't be rid of him. Sure we will. The tribal court will banishedhim from the reservation. Navo White Eagle, council sayyou be banish from reservation, from all Navajo, all time. Our people never see Navo. If you want talk, council listen. Since I can't produce proof of my innocence, I demand my right under triballaw to be tried by fire. [inaudible]. You mean test of courage? Yes. [inaudible], make fire pit. Chief Wykomas, I beg you, don't let Navo go through this terrible trial. This tribal law. But I tell you, he's innocent. We find out. Don't you realize what Navohas done for his people? If it weren't for him, your children would be hungry and sick,your old and young dying. You must understand. Navo couldn't have killed Yuba. He was with me when the shots were fired. Schoolteacher love, not save, Navo. Can't you see? Morgan was lying. I'm telling you the truth. I swear I am. Okeema say Navo shoot Yuba. Lolita. Shh, you must rest. Somebody must stop Morganand Connors from doing what they're planning. I've got to-- Don't worry. They'll be taken care of. Thank you, Panka. Now remember, don't tell anyone where I'm going. Panka be still like turtle. And take good care of Navo. Well, goodbye. Bye. Sure messed up our plans for letting Indian council handle Navo. How do you mean? --[inaudible] told me thecouncil found him innocent? How could they? They evidence was all against him. He demanded the test by fire. And walked through the fire pit? He did. Now Navo swears he'sgoing to find Yuba's killer and make him confess. Liable to spoil everything for us now. Ah, don't worry. He gives us any trouble, youcan fix him like you did Yuba. I should have fixed him instead of you. You can take of him afterI've gong to New York. Still figuring to take Lolita with you? Sure. I'll get the padre inFort Defiance to marry us. Well what about the prettylittle Indian girl, Okeema. To show you what a good friendI am, I'll give her to you. Wateeka! Okeema. Okeema, what wrong? I have sinned against myfather, my people, and Navo. Navo? Yes. I lied about seeing him shoot Yuba because I was jealous of Lolita. It's my fault he had to walk through fire. How your fault? I'm about to disgrace our people. How? Mr. Connors is-- is goingto marry Lolita and take her away from reservation. So? He said he would marry Okeema and she will soon bear him child. Okeema. I was outside andcouldn't help overhearing. And I'm partly to blame. I drove you into Connors arms by my-- my dream of marrying Lolita. So tomorrow you and I will be married. No, no, Navo. I won't let you wed when you're in love with her. Then I shall tell your father and we will abide by his decision. Give me till tomorrow to decide. Please, Navo. All right, Okeema. You'll give me your answer at sundown. Navo, Wateeka proud you. Colonel Harlow, there's really something wrong. You've got to stop Mr. Connorsand Morgan from whatever evil they have planned. Captain [inaudible]. Take your men and pick upRalph Connors and Jeb Morgan and bring them in for investigation. And have Navo and Chief Wykomas and his chiefs stand as witnesses. Yes, sir. I suggest, Miss Moreno,that after your long ride, you remain here in Fort Defiance. I'm sure Mrs. Harlow would bepleased to have you with us. Thank you, Colonel Harlow. Goodbye. Navo, Navo! Indian girl jump off cliff. Where? Above rustic bridge. Ho. Ho, [inaudible]. But if it is, then Connors killed her even though he was miles away. No time for revenge. Time for sorrow. You're right, Mother. What are those Indian women doing? Looks like they're preparing for a burial. Right across the road from my office? I know it's against the law for them to raise their dead onthe reservation compound, but looks to me that's what they're doing. Well, I'm going to put a stop to it. Hey, wait a minute. What's that coming over there? You know Chief Wykomas better than I do. Tell them they have to bury their dead away from the compound. Yes, Mr. Connors. Chief Wykomas, I bring youa message from Mr. Connors. What he say? You can't raise a body on the compound. It's forbidden, you know that. I'll talk to Connors. Chief Wykomas wishes to raisethe body of his daughter, Okeema, on the compound. Okeema. Yes, she's dead, found this morning at the bottom of a cliff. But why does Chief Wykomaswant to bury her over there? Because he knows that you'reresponsible for her death. Many moon we obey white man. When white man break own law,time Navajo use Indian law. And for many years, theNavajos had starved and wandered from place to place. The white man's law has taughtus how to cultivate the land and have given usschools for our children. Are we going to give up all this for the wrongs of two white men? Much what Navo say true, but Okeema dead. Chief Wykomas? Wykomas listen. Colonel Harlow has sent me to get Mr. Connors and Morgan for investigation. He requested you, your chiefs, and Navo be present at their trial as witnesses. Navajo tribe white men. As spokesman for our council, I believe we shall obey Colonel Harlow. We go. Come on. Let's get out of here. All right. Well, Connors, I'm glad tosee you're ready for your ride back to Fort Defiance. Let's go. Colonel Harlow, I have no case to sum up. The evidence against the defendants is too conclusive for rebuttal. So they wish to throw themselvesupon the mercy of this court. Captain [inaudible], would youbring me those fraudulent land title transfers. The discovery of these documents, bearing the thumbprints of Chief Wykomas, his daughter Okeema, sincedeceased, and three of his sub chiefs, in possession ofConnors following his capture, proves his participation, aswell as Morgan, in these crimes of fraud and murder. I regret the crimescommitted by these defendants are of such heinous nature,that any mercy by these court shall be denied them. It is therefore the sentence of those court, that the defendants, RalphConnors and Jeb Morgan, shall be executed by a firingsquad at dawn tomorrow. All right, come on. Good. White man law fair to Navajo. Council proud your. Navo, I've recommended yourappointment as Indian agent for this reservation. Why, thank you, sir. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Well, there it is. Wonderful, isn't it? Yes, but there's only one thing wrong. What's that? It should read Mr. and Mrs. That can easily be arranged.
