Did Billie... did she turn tricks? Sure, of course. During them times, you had to survive and she had to survive. Was she younger than most girls? No. Girls start young, some of 'em, you know.

Well, it was a jump. So, you were 15 years old then, weren't ya? No, I was 14. I beg your pardon. My first encounter with Billie Holiday was as a listener... not as a biographer or critic. Age 14, I happened to spot an album... "The Essential Billie Holiday" and curiously listened to the voice. A strange voice... that was more real and true... than anything I'd ever heard before. It told of experiences so deeply felt... wailed huskily from some netherworld... that I had no choice... I had to listen to where that voice was coming from. Linda was my big sister and she was my protector, and, uh... she was my best friend. We grew up in the Bronx Borough of New York. My father was a labour union organiser. Our family was Jewish but non-religious. Linda was a public high school teacher but she had been doing interviews on women and women's rights as a journalist for Paris Review for the New York Times Sunday magazine section. That's when she decided to start writing a biography on Billie Holiday. Even though they came from totally different backgrounds... I think she identified with Billie. I think she felt the pain of someone's struggles. She did not like seeing her as a victim which I think is the way she had been portrayed. Hello Pigmeat, how are you? Why hello, Mabel. It's good to see you. Yeah, where in the world is you been? Someone told me about this girl who could sing so beautiful. And I went by to see her and hear her. That's when I discovered her... a week or two after she started coming the Apollo Theatre. And that's where she made her stage appearance first time in her life. Why'd you think she was so nervous? Well, she was stage-frightened she'd never been on a stage before. And a lot of people can sing in them little small places with eight, ten, 15, 45 people... and then when you put 'em in front of a big audience... a thousand, two thousand people, they just freeze up. It must've been something! Tell us something, Billie about the background that, uh... brought about your interest in jazz. ♪ My man... ♪ And that was it? Well, I was the first white guy who ever heard Billie, you know. I was the first one who introduced her around. About the eighth stoop up here is where I first heard Billie Holiday. It says laundry there, see? And that's the place where Billie Holiday made her debut as far as I know in New York in about February of 1933. What did you hear that said to you "I have to let the rest of the world know about this?" I heard a singer who was an improvising horn player. Horn player? - Yeah, well, that's how... that's how she sounded. Any specific horn player? Well, I think she liked Louis... Louis Armstrong. - Louis Armstrong, I'm sorry. I need to add that last-- That's quite alright. And I knew, you know, that these two would... would find, uh... would make music together that was unprecedented. And it was. ♪ When the moon's kinda dreamy ♪ ♪ Starry-eyed and dreamy ♪ ♪ And nights are luscious and long ♪ ♪ If you're kinda lonely ♪ ♪ And all by your own-ly ♪ ♪ Then nothin' but the blues are brewin' ♪ ♪ The blues are brewin' ♪ ♪ When the wind through the window... ♪ ♪ If love goes a-thirstin' ♪ ♪ Till you feel like burstin' ♪ ♪ Then nothin' but the blues are brewin' ♪ ♪ The blues are brewin' ♪ I persuaded the American Record Company that they should record the hits of the day with the wonderful girl singer, and hit the jukebox trade.

And I went just for music. First time I met Billie was... in a place behind the Apollo Theatre and she asked me to take her home because some of her friends that were there she says, "I don't want them to take me home". The apartment was in Harlem, that was considered a ghetto. When we got there, she asked me to stay with us. I ended up staying, oh, about six months. Her mother used to tell me about her when she was a little girl. What would she tell you? That she was still in love with Billie's father. And a lot of times when she used to talk about it, she'd cry. Somebody told me that Billie used to go with girls. Now, is there any truth in that? Oh, of course! Her nickname among the men... they called her Mister Billie Holiday because she was seldom seen with fellas. And I will always believe that her mother was the cause of it cos she never wanted Billie to get close with any fellas. She would tell her they're no good. "I heard this about him" and "I heard that about him"... Her mother pushed that in her mind to be careful cos they'll break your heart. Just like Billie's father. What was he like? Whether the men who Billie went with treated her well or not... she always chose them for a reason. They played for her, they protected her... and in the man's world of the night club... they allowed her to do the one thing that mattered... which was to sing. Music didn't bring Billie to Harlem... but it was her voice that would allow her to escape.

What would be a good question for you to ask me... - You? - About Billie? You said that you used to alternate riff-raff joints, and then you'd play some big white hotel. Go from one extreme to the other. Is that true? Well, I don't call no place a riff-raff that pays me. She said you weren't your own boss... that you had too many managers. It's true? Both. I can't write about Billie Holiday with your band if I'm not gonna talk about your band. Am I? Can I? My name is Jonathan David Samuel Jones professional name Jo, J.O. And everybody professes to know her... they knew nothing about her. All that they knew was what was in it for them. What happened with her and Count Basie? I mean, why did that-- Count Basie? Can't you leave Count Basie alone? That's no problem. That was no problem. That was no problem. Well, why did she leave the band? She didn't leave the band, she was fired! Who fired her? John Hammond! John Hammond fired her? Why? That's a big question, if you can answer that they wouldn't have the UN. About Basie, um, why did Billie leave the band? Well, you see, here's the thing... there was a real problem with Billie and Basie. She weren't making enough money, simple as that and this is really one of the principal reasons why she left the band. How much was she getting paid then? I think 100 and a quarter a week something like that, at the most! She quit? Oh sure, sure. John Hammond wanted her to sing the blues. So, since she wouldn't sing the blues, he fired her. How can I verify it? His number's 0803 4173. Call him up and I'll tell him and I'll give him another heart attack. Call him. - I'm... I'm not... - Call him! - I'm not gonna call him now. - Call him! Listen, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna to ask him. No, call him! - You know I'm not gonna get through to him. I guess you've heard by now that Jo Jones said that you fired her. Oh, absolute lie. Absolute lie. ...because she wouldn't sing the blues. How can Jo say a thing like that? - Did you talk to Jo? - Yeah. Jo said I...? Oh, Jo's out of his mind. He's a garbage-mouth liar! Why didn't... would... He fired her because he wanted her to sing the blues! He wanted her to be a coloured mammy! Didn't I tell you not to let me catch you at that piano again? I'm sorry, Mam. If I'd have heard you coming I wouldn't have let you catch me. Well, let me fix you a good hot tub. I'm telling you this in front. He wanted her to just be yassa boss, yassa boss. And everybody talk about how he's the great white father. Don't give me that shit. But nobody got guts enough to tell the people that because they're afraid of him. The problem with Jo is, you know, that... Jo is not always the most reliable, uh... I just saw Jo last week. I'll have to ask him how he could possibly have given you such a personal... Sure, do indeed. It happened. That was a long time ago. How in the hell can I tell you - what happened 40 years ago? - How can I prove it? You don't have to prove it, it happened! - I believe you! - No, it happened! OK! But when I put something in print... I don't give a damn. Put it in print and quote me. It happened. So don't you ask if you're interviewing me and when I tell you something, you print it! Are you interviewing me or am I interviewing you? Where were you 30 years ago? Linda was very conscious of being a white writer and writing about Billie. You don't know what we was going through. What were you going through? We was going through hell. Miss Billie Holiday didn't have the privilege of using a toilet in a filling station. The boys at least could go out in the woods. You don't know anything about it because you've never had to subjugate yourself to it. Never! Most neighbourhoods where we were, were segregated by race. But we were very much aware of what was happening in the world, racially. Violations of people's civil rights. The horrors of dogs attacking black people in the South. The African-American struggle resonated with Linda. And it was always an outrage to Linda that people walked in the front door who were coming to see her but Billie Holiday had to walk through the kitchen to perform. This is no secret, of course that wherever musicians gather and talk about singers they generally elect you as their favourite. Now, who is your favourite? ♪ Alone, from night to night, you'll find me ♪ Jo Jones told me that, uh... Hammond fired Billie from the Basie Band because she wouldn't sing the blues. Is that the truth? It's probably... sure. Could be? She never told you? No, she never told me, but... I wanna be known as a singer who can sing the ballad who can sing up-tempo things. Don't tell me I'm only a blues singer that that's I all I can do is the blues. - And that's what-- - That's what they did! Did you two ever talk about this? We would've had to. See, now, you've got the misconception that black is the blues. Sure. It seems as if the people who were running the recordings were white... I mean the powers, the agents... let's say 7/8ths of the musicians were black. You see what people do to suppress you... the frustration of what connected with black performers. The difference in being, quote, a "black star" in relationship to it being a star. Billie Holiday, she's a black singer. Billy Eckstine, "Oh, you mean the black singer". And not Peggy Lee, she's a "Slav singer" or Barbara Streisand, she's a "Jewish singer". Not that, you don't get that. Get a load of the critics for God's sake the people who judge our music as being good or bad... there isn't a black critic. There was never a black critic in swing music. Why? Why? Because of the power structure is such that you never got a chance. You have all white critics to decide whether or not you were good or bad. It's a pleasure, always, to welcome Mr Billy Eckstine. Do black people get bugged... I think this is one of the most ironic things that a man named Paul Whiteman... was known as the "King of Jazz". Paul Whiteman was a white man. And, err, jazz is supposed to be-- Benny Goodman was the "King of Swing". We used to laugh at the fact that Benny Goodman was, uh, King of Swing. Paul Whiteman, King of Jazz, you know, these things they're absolutely comedic! Look at Tom Jones. Tom Jones openly declares that he got his style from Otis Redding, from Jackie Wilson from Chuck Berry and that he started learning how to sing ballads by listening to my records. Now, all four of us that they named where's ours? Where's our compensation? Where's your payday? The most remarkable things about jazz performers... you're way ahead of so many of the rest of us when it comes to de-segregation. Why is it that the colour thing has not ever really been that important with musicians? Who was it that brought about the job you did with Artie Shaw in the old days, you remember? Well, Artie Shaw. He asked me, did I want a job? So, I says, "Yeah, I want a job". And there was still a policy of no coloured singers being with a white organisation. Would you tell that story to us now? I first met Billie back in around 1930. Billie was just a young kid then and I was almost as hungry in those days as she was. I remember saying to her one day, "Billie... if I ever make the grade and get a band of my own, you're gonna sing with it". And sure enough, that's what happened. Do you remember when Billie first came to sing? To the best of my knowledge it would've had to have been in either '36 or '37. We were a travelling group of minstrels. We got a bus and travelled 300 miles. And the way we carried it out was part of the life. Did Billie have any trouble as a black singer with a white band? Yes, the normal kind of problems that would exist for any black person in those days. She was remarkable in that she was a trailblazer - without really, you know-- - Being conscious? Yeah, she wouldn't make a thing or anything. Today, it's hard to even describe the climate, you know like waitresses refusing to server her. After we would eat, she always ordered an extra hamburger and she'd put that in her purse... because she never knew when she would not be able to be served. The incidents concerning Billie were mostly concerning finding a place to stay - wherever we went. - Mm-hm. The usual racial problem. We'd get in in the early morning hours you see, and many times she either slept in the car... the bus, or... wherever. And where would you go? To a hotel. How did she take it? Do you remember an incident by any chance, when you first hit Kentucky and, uh, the sheriff, he came up to the band stand and said, "What's that black bitch going to sing?" And there was a brawl or something? Well, he didn't fire her, she left on her own. She had a lot of pride. How'd she take it? Uh... philosophically, I guess... in her vulgar language method. If she had other words at her disposal she would've used them. The only words she could speak were those in the song. This beautiful soul she had that she could only do by expressing herself singing. And now a little tune written especially for me... "Strange Fruit". ♪ Southern trees ♪ ♪ Bear a strange fruit ♪ ♪ Blood on the leaves ♪ ♪ And blood at the root ♪ ♪ Black bodies swingin' ♪ ♪ In the southern breeze ♪ ♪ Strange fruit hangin' ♪ ♪ From the poplar trees ♪ Around '39, she actually was a Columbia artist and they gave me permission to record "Strange Fruit"... which they didn't want to record.

That was the thing that made all the publicity and noise. ♪ Pastoral scene ♪ ♪ Of the gallant South ♪ ♪ The bulging eyes ♪ ♪ And the twisted mouth ♪ It was actually a shocking piece of material. She would come close to breaking up when she was singing "Strange Fruit". You can hear the crack in the voice, huh? Yeah, yeah, also in the eyes. And almost a reflection of what she had had to do in her lifetime in order to make it. The fact that negroes did not have equal chances... this was something that she felt very deeply... and about the only way she could really crusade or bring these thoughts together would be to sing songs like that. ♪ Scent of magnolia ♪ ♪ Sweet and fresh ♪ ♪ Then the sudden smell ♪ ♪ Of burning flesh ♪ ♪ Here is a fruit ♪ ♪ For the crows to pluck ♪ ♪ For the rain to gather ♪ ♪ For the wind to suck ♪ ♪ For the sun to rot ♪ ♪ For the tree... ♪ ♪ ...to drop ♪ ♪ Here is a strange... ♪ ♪ ...and bitter... ♪ ♪ ...crop ♪ Do you remember the first time she sang that song at Café Society?

"Most unusual song ever to be heard in a night club". ♪ Of burning flesh ♪ When she sang "Strange Fruit" she never moved. Billie stood there... all service stopped at the bar, everywhere. Can you remember any time where anybody - might have caused any commotion? - Oh, yes. I had people walk out. - These are white people? - White people. One party after another... "We come to your nightclub to be entertained... and we don't call this entertainment". "Strange Fruit"... What is that, man? The Treasury Department intends to pursue a relentless warfare against the despicable dope peddling vulture and public enemies. And we hope to place the drug addicts arrested under institutional care. It was Billie's interpretation of "Strange Fruit" not the song itself that changed the direction of American music. But not everyone stood to applaud her primal howl against the bloody history of white America. And her refusal to stop singing it... would give vindication to those powerful men already circling the decadent world of jazz in search of a high-profile target to burnish their reputation. And now that Billie's star shone so brightly... she could not easily retreat back into the night. I ought to get myself ready for this. You know, I'd better have a couple of drinks cos if gonna talk about her, I wanna feel good. She's something else, she was really something. When did you first meet her? I met her in 1942. I was just a kid, I was only, like, 20 years old. She used to call me in there, and... "You gotta write out the chords to this tune". Where was this, in her dressing room? Yeah! And she'd stand there with nothing but a pair of shoes on. That was it!

Orson Well... Tallulah Bankhead. The bar used to be packed with hero-worshippers. She looked like a panther... is the only way I can describe her with the most unbelievable face in the world. She really dug being high that's one thing I've got to say. But I never knew anyone with such a capacity. All the doormen along 52nd Street had what Lady needed. Like what? Like pot. Why? Why all those extremes? Why? And why shouldn't she? And would you say Billie was extremely smart in protecting herself? And she was in the hotel? Here at Alderson... the system was that when a person came in who was on drugs at the time that they were sent to the hospital and remained there until they were drug free. This prison was segregated as to race. She really went into the woodwork here. She had made up her mind that she was just going to do her time and get out as fast as she could. This was the room she occupied. She certainly was no trouble ever. She was a... generous person, I'd say, uh... in thought, anyway. She never bothered anybody. It's almost impossible to say how quiet she was. To my knowledge, she never sang a note. It took Linda a long time to work on the book. Eight years of her life. She had some bad times, and, uh, we would get calls in the middle of the night. I just don't feel like doing it. All this shoulda been done about this woman before she died not after she's dead, and everybody's... just going through all kinds of shit about it now cos I've had it up to here with that shit. As the time went on, she kept pushing her own set deadline further and further. At one point, I remember we had a discussion and I said, "You know, maybe it's just time to finish it, and to leave it imperfect". But she couldn't, it was so much part of her. The reason that Linda struggled so much was that inside her own head she heard the voice that she wanted Billie to have... but she couldn't get that correct voice on paper. ♪ Just one more chance ♪ ♪ I've learned the meaning... ♪ Haven't you gotta find a piano man of your own that you bring in there?

Why not? You've thought as much about it. You have developed a style, a technique, just as much as they have done, you please just as many people so, why are you not just as much an artiste as any one of them? Oh, I think you do. I think you do know that. What was the difference between what Ella did and Billie? She taught me that if you almost laugh out loud but never quite make it, the audience will laugh. If you almost cry, but never quite make it the audience will cry. When would she cry? She'd cry about a lot of things but never when she thought anybody was watching her. ♪ ...to cry my heart out ♪ ♪ For just... ♪ Nobody could sing like Lady. Not ever. We worked the Club Ebony together. That's when John Levy came into the spotlight.

As soon as she was arrested I immediately put her in Twin Pines kept her under full psychiatric controls for five days and proved that she was not addicted to an opiate. Now, you made observations. You have to, especially if you're a psychiatrist. But what's made her the way she is? What drove her to a series of John Levys, to heroin? I don't like to use this word and it's not a good word, but... she's really a psychopath. A psychopath? An impulse-driven... strong, talented... but not dependable individual... who does this because this is what she has the impulse to do right now, and she gets into all sorts of trouble. A psychopath. Key to this thing is the impulse. Was there any perversity in this? When I said "perversity", I meant a demon. You know, there's a demon sometimes eating away at... It kinda forces you to... do something that's going to illicit some kind of shock. And this is something I can identify with. As Linda went on the identification became much more intense. Like Billie, she was attracted to men who were not bringing out necessarily the best in her. She was married twice, and she was divorced twice. While she was writing the book... Linda became close with some of the people she interviewed. One time we were in our apartment the phone rang, and a man's voice said "Can I speak to Linda?" Of course I asked, "Who's calling?" and he said, "Well, it's Bill". Linda said, "Do you know who Bill is?" I said, "No". And she says, "Well, you do it's Count Basie". Ask me a question about Billie. I'm not sure what Linda's relationship with Basie actually was. It's an impression that there was a closeness based on what she had said to me. I understand that one of the reasons for your present happiness is your husband Louis. How does he react to some of your more suggestive things? Ah, no, he tells me how to sing and what to sing and, oh, it's just getting terrible. Well, your husband's right here in the dressing room with us. Mr Louis McKay. Mr McKay, tell us something about how you two work together. Well, we have something like a private agreement. I handle all the business, she handles all the music. Though she tells me sometimes "You stay outta my music". And does she stay out of the business? Yes, she does. - Then you'll get along fine. What else are you doing besides the records and touring around the spots? Well, 12th October, my dream is supposed to come true. I'm going to Europe. Oh, you've never been there? No. - Oh! Well... I've always wanted to go. Is this a vacation trip to Europe, or? No, honey, no vacations, all work. ♪ Are the stars out tonight? ♪ ♪ I don't know if it's cloudy or bright ♪ ♪ For I only have eyes for you, dear ♪ ♪ The moon may be high ♪ ♪ Millions of people go by ♪ ♪ But I only have eyes for you ♪ ♪ I don't know if we're in a garden ♪ ♪ Or on a crowded avenue ♪ ♪ You are here, so am I ♪ ♪ Millions of people go by ♪ ♪ But they all disappear from view ♪ ♪ And I only have eyes for you ♪ What is it that you're after out of life yourself, Billie, now?

I was with her during the return to New York. This was a tremendously big concert. I'm sure you've been told all the people that were on it. Duke Ellington's orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, Bird, Prez... Count Basie. But it seemed like everybody there had come to see one person. And now I'd like you to know America's number one song stylist, Miss Billie Holiday. She closed the show. And she sang encore after encore after encore. If we stayed on that stage an hour... we stayed on an hour and 30 minutes. Well, after the concert was the fight. Louis began to loudmouth, and that started a big rumble... which then we all ended up out in the street... and he literally knocked her across the street. But she loved that punishment. This is the nature of a masochist. After he had just beaten her severely and kicked her... is that after they had gotten the punishment then they had been so completely gratified then they can just enter into a sexual tryst. Louis had a technique going of trying to control her mind. It was like hypnotism. "You can't depend on anyone but me". "You have no friends but me, you must stay in here and keep yourself away from everyone but me". There were days when he just kept her under lock and key. He'd boss her around... and tell her she "couldn't do this" she "couldn't do that". And she wanted something to eat, and he'd say "Go on to bed, you don't need anything to eat". And she lost so much weight. She looked like a skeleton. If you were to talk to Louis he would probably tell you an entirely different story. He's a pathological liar. And he'd probably ask for money. There was a time he came up to the apartment after he hit her on the head. He said he hit her on the head with a telephone? Yeah, I locked her in my bathroom. He came and he said, "I got a gun here". See, I can't... I can't write whether you're telling me something about Louis or not. I can't say it, write it because I'm liable and he's alive and he's tough. - Yeah, mm-hm. I'm in trouble, not you. In the process of interviewing for the book Linda had been threatened... by people within the world that she was travelling. I don't know why she was threatened. She was a journalist, she was interviewing... but I think the threat was personally motivated. At times, she said there was discomfort with how she was spoken to in terms of having a relationship with Basie. I don't know whether it was because of the age. I just know she had been threatened. Not by Basie, but by some of the people surrounding him. OK, uh... I guess we're gonna end now. Do you know something? This is the end of our interview. ♪ I'll never smile again ♪ ♪ Until I smile at you ♪ ♪ I'll never laugh again ♪ ♪ What good would it do? ♪ I was in love with Billie... not necessarily Billie, but somebody. That voice, it turned me on. But when I met her, she was a repulsive. She looked a little scabby, a little dirty. Poor Billie, her heart was just broken. Of all the songs you've written, Billie Holiday which one most clearly tells your story? Oh, I think "Don't Explain". Did you write the words and the music? Yes. - Both of them? I had help with it. Close your eyes and speak the words like a poet. Um, hush now, don't explain. I know you raised Cain. I'm glad that you're back. Don't explain. Quiet, don't explain. You mixed with some dame.

But she would talk to me for hours and tell me about how she got started in prostitution. She was 13 years old and at that time, she had her own girls on the street. She was terribly worried about whether or not God would forgive her. ♪ My life ♪ ♪ Yours, love ♪ ♪ Don't explain ♪ As far as I'm concerned her use of narcotics was just another way of self-punishment. She told me that when she was a little girl down in her hometown... she was raped. Who raped her? She didn't tell me. There were tears in her eyes. She was always a vulnerable child to me. I don't think she was ever really in love in her life. Nor ever knew what it was. She just suffered. She went to hospital on the Sunday. She knew she was dying. That damn hospital. They had her under arrest, this woman laying in bed. But she did tell me one time that if they ever arrested her again that she couldn't go through that experience and she'd rather be dead. No innovator was like her, nobody! And all she wanted to do was sing. She ain't bothering nobody. Billie had a Cadillac and a mink, so what? What's wrong with that? Wasn't she entitled to have a Cadillac? Wasn't she entitled to have her mink? Wasn't she entitled to have diamonds? "Oh, you ain't supposed to have that... you're a negro! Stay in your place, you know". All y'all need to do is get some black-eyed peas and rice and that's all ya'll need. I'm talking about what we went through. No vocalist had ever went through what she went through. "Greatest country in the world". The most stupid, most prejudiced, racial people... even as of today. I'm leaving, quick as I can. I will not be a part of this farce. July the 17th. That's when she died. I closed up Miss Billie Holiday's casket... and put two flowers on it. And the question, Billie, that I was going to ask was that why so many jazz greats seem to die so early? The only way I can answer that question is... we try to live one hundred days in one day. I, myself, try to please so many people. I guess we all suffer. It was in the middle of the blizzard of 1978. Linda was going to Washington D.C. for a Basie concert. And, um, we received a phone call from my mother... and... she said you have to come home, Linda just died. The police told my parents that she had committed suicide and jumped out of the window and we were just devastated. And also... yeah, unsure that that... was how she died. To our knowledge, there was no note. She was a writer, and there never was a letter. At the time, the Washington D.C. police did not have a great reputation for integrity, and we really questioned how much they had actually investigated Linda's death. My thought is that, uh... somebody had pushed her. Uh... I have absolutely no evidence of it... only what I know of Linda, and, um... the surrounding situations. When Linda died, it appeared that she had been getting ready to go to sleep, because one of her rituals was to put on a facemask. When she was found, she had the facemask on. ♪ I love you Porgy ♪ ♪ Don't let him take me ♪ ♪ Don't let him handle me ♪ ♪ And drive me mad ♪ ♪ If you can keep me ♪ ♪ I wanna stay here ♪ ♪ With you forever ♪ ♪ I've got my man ♪ I just thank the Lord that I did know this girl when things were different. ♪ I know he's coming ♪ And I would pray that she'd come back. ♪ He's going to handle me and... ♪ Wouldn't that be nice, just one day? ♪ ...told me so... ♪ But you had to get a good ticket to get there. ♪ It's going to be... ♪ ♪ Like dying ♪ I can't cry about Billie now.
