[Olivia] My mom is gonna be home soon. [Zach] Yeah, well, I don't care. [instrumental music] [both moaning] [keys jingling] What the hell do you think you're doing? What, do you just barge in? I live here. I pay for here. What is this, afternoon school study hour? Sorry, Mrs. D. Yeah, well, you look real sorry. You need to leave. You better go. I'll call you. Do you know how embarrassing that was? -Oh, I think I have an idea. -Whatever. Would you stop this whatevering. You're 17 years old. That's right. I'm 17, and Zach's 20 and unlike you, we have a life. Oh, I see. So, what? Should I start charging you hourly rates now? You're hilarious. He is not for you. -I don't know what it is. -Menopause? Liv, at your age, love and sex seem like the same thing. If you get pregnant now... Mom, I'm not getting pregnant but thanks anyway. You don't, people don't always plan these things. Mistakes happen. Everybody makes mistakes. I have made mistakes. Just... don't be like me, okay? So that's what I was, a mistake. That's not what I meant. Oh, God. Maybe you were. [telephone rings] Hello, Dunne residence. [male #1] This is Connection Credit calling in regards to unusual activity on your credit card. Did you charge $563 to the Kensidyne Corporation? No, I don't recall making a charge to Kensidyne Corporation. What kind of corporation is that? I don't know that I can tell you that, Mrs. Dunne. What do you mean you can't tell me? We have a very strict policy against releasing that type of information over the phone. I see. Well, you know, if it's against your policy to release that information to me then it's against my policy to make a payment. Look, we're not demanding payment yet. We're simply asking for confirmation... Listen, this is what we're gonna do. I will talk to my husband and we will call you back. That's fine, Mrs. Dunne. -What's your phone number? -555-0156. -And your name? -I'm JT Smith. Thank you for looking into this matter. We'll call you back. Thank you. Bye. [sobbing] I miss you so much, daddy. [sniffles] [beeping] [ringing] [Sean's voice on recorder] Hi, it's Sean, I'm not here right now uh, leave a message. Hi, baby, it's me. Um, I bet you're having a much better day than I am. Your daughter, um... I really wanna underline your daughter at this point but... [exhales] Um... Actually, the reason I'm calling is because Connection Credit Card company called about a $563 charge to Kensidyne Corporation. Do you know anything about that? Listen, call me when you get this, okay? Bye. [Olivia] Mom, where's my red shirt? I don't know, I've never worn it. [Olivia] I didn't ask that. [sighs] Look on your floor. [Olivia] It's not there. I can't find it. Keep looking. [Jill] Listen, I've got back-to-back showings there's no way I can fit it in. Joel, I'll see what I can do, okay? [phone rings] Ugh! Hi, Jill Dunne. Yeah. Tam, hey. Welcome. No, listen, tonight's not good for me. Sean's coming home. I will. Tell the girls I said hi, okay? Bye. -Hi, can I help you? -Hi, I hope so. -I, uh... -Checking in or out? I was hoping you could help me. I, um... got a charge on my credit card for your hotel and I've never stayed in your hotel and so I wondered if you could just look it up and see when it is that I supposedly stayed here and when my card was signed. Okay, can I see some ID? Um, sure. It's a nice hotel. There you go. [female #1] Great. [keys clacking] Yes, I do have that credit card number here but it was signed by a Sean Dunne. Is he... My husband, yeah. Um... when was that? Could you... excuse me for a moment? Sure. [cellphone rings] Jill Dunne. Oh, hey, Liv, no, sweetie you know what, I've got back-to-back today. There's no way I could pick you up. Can you walk? It's not that far. -Excuse me, miss. -Mrs., actually. -So I'm Mrs. Dunne. -Oh, Mrs. Dunne. I'm Richard Grant, I'm the manager of the hotel. Now, according to our records your husband signed off on the card on July 8th. Well... that's not possible. He was actually in Southampton then, and I was home so neither one of us could have been here. -How odd. -Hm. -Excuse me. -Sure. The credit card company is going to be faxing over a copy of your husband's signature. You never know with identity theft these days but at least you caught it in time, right? Thanks so much for your help. So have you, uh, stayed with us before? No. No, but actually, I could use a vacation. I know what you mean. I like to vacation up north myself but even when I'm on vacation I still feel like I'm working. When did life become about keeping busy, huh? Welcome to my world. No, actually, I'm in the market for a condo myself. If you could recommend something. Yeah, just give me a call I'd love to help you out. Here you go, sir. -Thank you. -That was quick. I know the owner. Is this your husband's signature? That looks like Sean's writing, but I... Excuse me. Well, there must be some mistake. He was in South Hampton. What were the dates he was away? Um, the 4th to the 9th. I remember because he left on the holiday. [Richard] Registration says he was here at this hotel during those days. That's weird. I'm sure there's a good explanation. [Sean's voice on recorder] Hi, it's Sean, I'm not here right now. Uh, leave a message. Hey, Sean, it's me, listen I need to talk to you as soon as possible, um... Call me right when you get this, okay? Bye. [Sean's voice on recorder] Hey, honey, it's Sean. I got to stay another night, it's, uh... work thing. I'm sorry I missed you. I hope you're hanging in there with your dad's anniversary. I know it's always a tough time. I love ya. [Olivia] You're hilarious. Olivia, get off the phone I need to make a call. Yeah, and she's all, like, giving me attitude, you know. I'm like, mom, whatever you don't even know him, I do. Olivia get off the phone I need to make a call. I said get off the phone. -Olivia! -What? Get off the phone, I need to make a call. Yeah, me too. Wrap it up. I'm busy. -Zachery? -Mrs. D! Olivia's gonna call you back. Mom, what is your problem? I need to call your father, it's important. -Yeah, my call was important. -Not like this. God, you don't even know him and you're all... -Ugh! Never mind. -Done. Yeah, you just know everything, don't you, mom? He's a waste of time, I know that. Are you talking about Zach or dad? You don't talk about your father like that. God, this house isn't big enough. [telephone rings] Hello? Ms. Dunne. Who's this? Uh, this is, uh, Richard Grant. The Colston hotel manager. I really shouldn't be doing this, but your husband or whoever it is that's using his or your credit card has just checked in again. I thought you should know. Beautiful. [giggling] [exhales] [tires squealing] Hello. Jill? Olivia? Please, don't rush me all at once. Hey. Hey. You know, I remember when you used to come and jump into my arms when I came home. Yeah? I remember when you used to paint paintings instead of selling prints and graphics. Where did that come from? What do you mean? Okay, okay, look, can we just be, uh... or even just pretend to be I don't know, us, tonight? You do remember us, right? Welcome home... husband. I sure missed you. It's great to have you back. Hm. Insert some kisses and affection here, right? -You okay? -Yeah. You know, I just, I had a weird day. Yeah, tell me about it. I had a four-hour layover and had to sit next to a guy who hadn't bathed since 1999. -Where's Olivia? -Hey, dad. Hey, hey. Hey. You know what? Hm. You used to come and jump into my arms too, you know. [Olivia] Hey, dad, how was the art expo? I'm gonna go get some more wine. I wouldn't call it art. How are the life and times of Olivia Dunne? Not a lot changes in a week. And, uh... how's, uh... Overprotective, obsessive compulsive, interfering. Alright, alright, okay, so you learned some new adjectives. Just go easy on her, okay. I mean, she is the glue that kind of holds all this together, so... I think maybe she's been sniffing that glue, dad. Enough, okay? That's out of line. Hey, Sean, did you, uh, did you get my message about Kensidyne Corporation? Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'll look into that tomorrow because the last thing we need is bad credit and more debt, right? So you don't know anything about it? No, I said I'd look into it tomorrow, so... -I bet you will. -What? Let's eat guys. Come on. So, Olivia, did you tell your dad about Zach? Mom. Zach? It's nothing. Oh, it was something. Well, maybe I should meet him. -It's nothing big, really. -Nothing? I couldn't pry them apart with a crowbar. -Mom! -Okay, wait, wait, wait. Guys, please, look your mom's concerned. That's her job, right? You don't have to be her translator dad. You know what, you need to show some respect. It's a free country. Not for you. Yeah, I guess not. [sighs] [door slams] Guess it's a bit late for a... group hug here? Um... it's Tanya's birthday today. She called earlier, and I promised her I was gonna stop by, so I'm gonna stop by I'll be back in a bit. But I just got home. I'll be back by 10:00, okay? Alright then. Okay, I'll see you when you get back then. [sighs] Another family night success. [sighs] I don't know what's with her lately. Yeah. So this, uh, Zach thing am I gonna have to get out the shotgun wait on the porch type thing? I never wanna get old. Hey, neither do I. [club music] Didn't you say anything? Well, what I supposed to say? Uh, don't sleep with my husband? -I like that. -Oh, God. So, what are you gonna do? -A drink's a start. -Hm, yes. Yes, yes, thank you, you guys. I said it once, and I'm gonna say it again sometimes an affair is the best thing for a marriage. It saved mine. You're divorced! Yeah, but before that. [laughing] [Jill] I like that. Oh, I couldn't. Guys, I... No, I can't do it. Might make you feel better. [laughing] First date never felt so good. You guys are bad. But seriously, you got to do something. Yeah... well, like you said, a drink's a start. [knocking on door] -Hello? -Come in. -Oh, I... -I'm your five o'clock. I'm sorry I should probably have told you who I was, on the phone. No problem. I, uh, just, uh, wanted to say that, well, I'm... Let me rewind. I'm sorry about your husband. Don't be, he's not. They never are, are they? My ex-wife, same thing. Took half the money, plus the alimony. That hotel's the last thing I've got. If she could be selling body parts, mine she'd be doing it. You own the hotel? I used to own a whole whack of them but, hey, it's only money. Happiness, that's something. Donald Trump made it back from bankruptcy, so can I. Money's just a way of keeping score. I guess that's one way of looking at it. It's the only way, if you want to stay sane. [chuckles] Here I am, I'm-I'm spilling out my whole life story. No. I-I'm-I'm sorry, it's been a... very long week. What is it today? Friday? Tuesday. You know, actually I don't mind, I mean, it's kind of refreshing to have someone be honest for a change. So what are we looking at? -Excuse me? -The condo. Right. Let me show you. It's got 2400 square feet three bedrooms... a den... and a kitchen. It's actually very spacious. As you can see it's well constructed and, um, all new appliances. Uh, and the home owner association's fee is only $435. Which is very low for this area. How long have you been doing this? -Why? -You're a good sell. If you ever need a job... -Am I blushing? -A little. For you it's nice and close to the hotel. -I see you found... -The living room. Yes, the living room. You're getting quite good at this. I had a great teacher. And I had a good time. So what do you think? -I'll need a day. -Okay. Well, thank you very, very much for your time. If you, uh, ever need anything don't hesitate to let me know. Would you like a drink? [laughs] Um... um... yes, actually I think I could use a drink. W-w-what is that? Oh... my dad gave me this. So, uh, is this a slow night? I decided to give everybody the night off so we could be alone. Hm, isn't that gonna cost you some business? It's only money. Thanks, Thomas. My pleasure, Mr. Grant. -How are you doing, Thomas? -Oh, very well. Thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you. You know there's something about marriage, it's something that they put in the cake. You lose all your friends, and when you get divorced you look around and you say, where'd they all go? To where did it all go, and not complaining. [glasses clink] Hm, well, this has really been an interesting day. You know life's a funny thing. You never know where you're gonna end up. You go down one road... leads to another road. To be honest with you I didn't think I'd, uh I'd be here at this point in my life. I thought I'd, uh... have the perfect, gorgeous family. Perfect home perfect kids perfect wife the one that never gives up. Certainly didn't think I'd be living at my own hotel. At least your husband... brought you here in a back handed kind of way. To back handed husbands and the luxurious Colston hotel. Affordable living is only a drive away. Marketing came up with that. I like it. I know what you mean though, and... something that was everything, you know something that really meant something to you and you look around and you just think how did I get here? Where did everything go? I know exactly what you mean. To the lonely hearts club band and errant husbands. No, wait, wait, wait, you have to look each other right in the eyes. That's the only way it means something. Now, we can drink. [glasses clink] No ring. No ring. [knock on door] [male #2] Room service, Mr. Grant. -Damn! -Oh, my God. Go away! Jesus, I can't do this anymore. -No, wait. -No, Richard, I'm married. No, this is right. Well, then what are you doing here? I don't know. I need to go home. [intense music] Jill. Jill! Oh, God. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm sorry, Mr. Grant. I was, I was... I'm sorry. Okay, your mom totally freaked. Yeah, you got the freak part right. I'm really sorry. Oh, no, it's cool, it's cool. It's like DiCaprio in-in that play movie... -"Romeo and Juliet?" -Yeah. Yeah, we might wanna skip the whole suicide thing. They die in the end? I must have missed something. You're, like, totally zoned out, aren't you? No, I'm just keeping up the family tradition. You better go before super-freak gets home. -Oh, come on. -Of course. Alright. I'm out of here. -Call me later. -Bye. Where were you? [thunder rumbling] [intense music] [cellphone rings] You gonna get that? -Yeah. -Okay. Hello. [Richard] I just wanted to make sure that you got home, okay. Are you alright? You have the wrong number. [engine turning over] [birds chirping] Yes, yes, I do, yes, I understand. Yeah. Okay, I'll-I'll email both versions over to you you can have a look, you can decide for yourself. Yeah. -Mom? -What? Geez, they cut back your meds? You know, I don't know what has happened to you with this whole tough girl thing but it's really making me crazy. I didn't even say anything. Well, that would be a first. Baby, you ready, come on, I got to meet the band? [Olivia] I'll meet you out front. I don't want him hanging around here. -You don't even know him. -Oh, yes, I do. -No, you don't. -Yes, I do. -No, you don't. -I'm serious, Liv. I am serious. -Whatever. -No! Listen to me. No, you listen to me. If you'd half of what I do what we do, maybe you'd be happy enough in your own life not to mess mine up. God, Liv, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jesus. What just happened here? Like you care. Uh, Mr. Tyler, this isn't rocket science. We increase the size of the mezzanine and, uh, thereby we get more mid-level conferences and, uh, increase bottom line profitability. It's just that simple. Hey, Grant... stay away from her. Excuse me, gentlemen. What are you doing here? Stop taking pictures. You know illicit video recording is considered invasion of privacy. She's already taken out a restraining order on you. How am I supposed to make a settlement with her if I can't even see her? You're lucky she hasn't hit you with an assault indictment. It's over. Don't push me any further. Richard, why don't we, uh, pick up our business after you get this sorted out? No, no, no. It's just a divorce proceeding. We-we've all been through this. We'll, uh, call you in a few months. Josh. -Sorry, Richard. -Brad-M-Mr. Tyler... Don't let something like this... Hey, Steve, could I talk to you for a second? Don't embarrass me in front of other people again. -Do you understand? -She's mine now, Grant. Don't you ever embarrass me. -I love the master bedroom. -It's nice, huh? If you'll notice, the open floor plan allows you not to feel completely cut off from the kitchen. -And this must be the kitchen. -Yes, it is. It has everything you could ever want, even free gas. Wow. Take a look around. [cellphone rings] Excuse me. Jill Dunne. I feel really awful about what happened last night. -I'll be right back. -Oh, okay. Take a look at them. How did you get my cell? [Richard] From your business card. Look, I-I want to apologize for calling you at home. It was-it was stupid. Your-your husband, your family was there. It's just that... It just that it was, it was something what happened last night, was really something and I think you knew that too. I... I-I don't connect to-to everyone. Not to anyone really... and my life was falling apart until I met you but when I... I held you in my arms it was like, something like this doesn't come around every day and I, I know you know that. Go ahead and take a look. Well, um, Mr. Grant I'm glad you're happy with your location however I am with some other clients right now. I want you... and I know that you need me too. I'm glad your needs have been met I hate to cut this short, but, um... don't call me again. I just want you to know that, uh... your husband just booked a... a room for next weekend, with her. [dramatic music] You looked so beautiful last night. -We should get married. -Are you high? Yeah, a little. I'm 17, hello. Okay, i-if this was a 100 years ago you'd have, like eight kids by now and getting ready to die. I'm serious, okay. We could go to Vegas for the weekend we hit some concerts on the way back. Have you met my parents? Your parents. You see how well that works out. Okay, all you can eat buffet, free drinks no more hassles about where we have to sleep. We should get married. What planet are you on? You gotta get out of here before my mom walks in. Fine. Fine. You know what, I'll just go home and I'll cry myself to sleep alone, again. Zach? Don't you have a home? I... I think so, Mrs. D. -Goodnight then. -Mom. Liv, I want you upstairs in five minutes. I don't know what's with her. You better go. [Sean] Hey. What's this? [Jill] How long? -When? -I'm not stupid, Sean. Don't act like you're stupid. -Jill, I... -How long? -A-a couple of months. -A couple. -Six. -Six. So for half a year you've been doing this to me... -Yeah. -And to her. Mm-hmm. You love her? It just happened. Over and over for six months? [sighs] Do you love her? No, I don't love her, okay. It's just one of those things that just happened. God, you are so cliche. And you have been so... Since your father died you have... you have shut down. No, y-you are not gonna do this. This is not about me. But it is about us. No, it's not about us. It's about you and it's about her. -It's about both of you. -You're not there! Okay? Here. Mentally, emotionally... I don't know what, since I can remember. I needed to know someone. What do I have to say, what do I have to be for you to just... just be there? God, you have no idea what it's like. You have completely shut down on me. You shut down on everybody. I mean people need things. I need things! Oh, you think I don't need things? God, this is so like you. Just listen to us, this separation it's me this, it's you that. I mean, we're supposed to be a couple. We were supposed to be. Were. Were. We have not been a couple for a very long time. Look, I'm sorry. I just, I don't know what else to say. God, you know you're right. This is about us. Look, I'm calling it off. Do you think that's just gonna make it all go away? I don't want it to end, not like this. I don't know what this is anymore. Whatever it is I have to do, I will do it. Okay? I can fix this. -It's not that easy. -I can make it that easy. It was supposed to be easy. You remember that? We used to say that if a couple had to work on their marriage that they shouldn't be married. I can't believe we ever thought that. I don't wanna lose you. [sighs] Remember our-our honeymoon? We couldn't afford to go anywhere so we camped up on stone lake... It was cold as hell, but we camped. We got caught in the rain... [Sean] It was just easy for us. Not like now... Do you love me? Because I love you so much, and I don't want to lose you. I don't want to... spend my life without you. I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't want to be with her, I want to be with you and I'm gonna make this work. I know we have something to work on, I just need... I just need to know that I haven't screwed it up so badly that it's over. I love you, I love what we had and I want to get it back. I don't want it to be so complicated. Maybe, maybe t-maybe that's what we need. -What? -We need some time... [Sean] Time away together, you know you, me, Olivia, just so we can reconnect. I mean, no phones, no-no jobs, no city, just, just us. You know, just easy. I don't know. Let's go up north... [Sean] stone lake, we'll camp by the old mill. We could, we could leave tomorrow... You, me and Olivia. I mean, simple. -Liv has never been simple. -Well, I know. We-we've never given her a chance to be. I don't even know how to talk to her anymore. Let's do it for her then. I mean, do it for us if you think that we even... I have to believe... that we can make this work. Please give me a week. -I'll try. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, alright. Everybody set? I guess. What, you guess. Come on, come on, come on, you. Hey, turn that frown upside down, alright? Get in the car. -Ready? -Yeah. Alright then. We're good to go. Hey, Liv. Liv? Liv. [Jill] If I can hear it, you're going deaf. -What? -Turn it down. We need gas. I know. I know. -Did you miss a turn? -You have got the map. [Jill] No, I think you made a wrong turn. - Are we lost? - No. I've been here a million times. Yeah, but this doesn't look familiar. Do you want to drive? [Jill] I couldn't do any worse. Okay, I'm going to get us there, okay. Good times. Look at that, there it is. That's it. -That's it. -Yeah, great, dad. [Sean] Who got you there? Look at that. We're going in the boat. I hate my life. -You what? -I hate my life. [Sean] Is it not it? Olivia? [Olivia] Yeah, that's great dad. [Sean] Who's the man? -You're the man dad. -Who's the man? -Stop. -Who's the man? -Don't push it. -Huh, huh? There's no service up here. It says limited, but there's nothing. [Jill] There is a pay phone right over there. So does it look familiar now? Huh? Yeah, same gas station, same smell same everything. Weird. We haven't been in here in what, what is it 10 years? Uh, nine, and yeah, it's been a while... Nine, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I'm sorry I snapped at you. Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get something to eat, okay? Okay. -Excuse me? -Yeah? Uh, excuse me. You wouldn't happen to know how I could get to stone lake, would you, am I close? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, We're, uh, going up there ourselves. -Family vacation? -Yeah. Oh, you don't know my family, but... [Zack's voice on recorder] You got the Z man. Where are you? I just wanted to say hey, and I miss you already, Z. It's going to be a long-ass week. We're about an hour from Woodstock some place called stone lake. I don't know my parents keep ranting about some old mill they want to camp near. Trying to relive a lost youth or something, like I care. -I should be so lucky. -Yeah, yeah. Anyway, just, um, just stay on this road right until it, uh, just veers off the right. -You can't get lost. -Hey, I recognize you. You tried to sell me a condo. -Right. -Well, thank you very much. I, I appreciate your help. -You got a beautiful family. -Yeah, yeah. [Richard] You have a good time. -Small world. -Yeah. You know, I'm going to go get them to hook up the boats. -You okay? -Yeah, I'm good. Well, I guess my cell phone is out for the week, so... I'll talk to you when I can. I love you, Zack. So this is my vacation. Great. Did you get hold of him? No, I just got his machine. Liv, take it easy, we got a whole week ahead of us so let's just relax and have a pseudo good time here, okay. Alright? [Sean] I don't think there's poison oak this time of year. You know what, in all the years, I've never even... I still not recognize what poison oak is. [Jill] Really, I'll show you. I'll point it out. [Sean] We're gonna go a hike. We're gonna go a huge hike, Olivia. Yes, it's gonna be so great. You know, it's like, uh, actual climbing, rock climbing. -Look at this. -Smell that? -Yeah. -Mmm, so good. Smell that? That's nature. That's right. Alright. This is not a boat. This is an air mattress. And could the mosquitoes out here get any bigger? Oh! Could we just get this loaded please? Where am I supposed to sleep? We are camping. We're sleeping under the stars. You have never seen dark like this. Well, I don't want bugs and whatever crawling in my face and across my mouth half way through the night. We'll put up a tent for the princess, okay. -Good. -Good. Mom, you did not actually make a list. -It's your mom, remember? -Hey, you know what? If it weren't for me you would have forgot the food. Hey, hey, hey. Who needs food? Look, we've got nature. Seven days and counting. -Alright. Let's go. -We got everything. -Yeah. -Here we go. [motor whirring] Whoa. -Alright. You ready? -What? Get on back here, you're gonna take over. -What? -You're the skipper. Get back here. -Got it? -Okay. Watch it right there. You just turn the grip if you want to accelerate left and right to turn, right, just like Zack's bike. Keep your eye out for oncoming boats. Steer to the right of them. I don't think we'll see many oncoming boats out here. Let's go, you can do it. [Jill] Come on, Liv. Yeah, there. Now it's working. Okay, let's take another one. This way, one, two... [intense music] Now pull it towards you... -Then straight down, alright? -Okay. You will have to give it gas. Then we go around. [Sean] There you go... [sighs] Hey, was this a good idea? It's weird, I can even remember certain rocks, certain trees. Yeah? What? You remember that, um, that rope swing? Oh, yeah, oh, my God, my stomach still hurts just thinking about that. That was funny. I don't think I've laughed that hard since. I don't think you have either. Okay, gross. I'm right here people. Hey, hey, I'm touching your mom's leg! You just keep us on course, skipper. -Wow! -Isn't it pretty? [Sean] It's beautiful. Am I just driving you randomly or is there a specific destination? Oh, it is coming up. [Sean] You hear that? What? Here, scoot over. We've gotta secure the motor. -What? -We've got to secure the motor. [Olivia] What? -You hear that sound? -What is that? That is the sound of excitement. -Put it on. Put in on. -Get yours. Here we go. Here's a paddle. -Paddle? -Yeah. What the... Push up that rock. Push up that rock. -Keep us in the middle. -Paddle. Keep us in the middle! Alright, that's it, that's it. Hey, in the middle. Keep your... Paddle, paddle, paddle, come on. [screaming] Alright, you can stop paddling now, Liv. I don't think I can. I can't even feel my hands. You will. You did great. -First time. -I'm proud of you! [Sean] Nice work. -Isn't this gorgeous? -Ah! -We're camping. We're camping. -Alright, there we go. -Camping. -Here we are. We're here. Okay, we'll make camp here tonight. Tomorrow we hike up to the old mill, alright? Sounds good. Do you even know where we are? Come on. Do I know where we are? -What's that? -What? There's, uh, it's a bear. -There. -Where? Where? What? I'm joking, I'm joking. Come on, you're guys. You're too serious. Let's go. The sooner we get in, the sooner we eat. -Good, I'm starving. -Let's go get some food. Yeah. Go get it. It's you. To where? God, we're, like, 10 feet from the water. -Jump out. -Jump out where? Here, mom, hold my hand. Grab the rope, the rope. Oh, God. -Some people never grow up. -Lighten up, mom. Hey, I'm just playing around until the food's ready. [Jill clears throat] It's ready. We called you. You didn't call me. So what do we do out here? Nothing. That's the whole point. There's no cars, no motorcycles, no ambulances no sounds, no trains, no sirens, no people. You just sit back and relax. I could have relaxed at home. Hey, check out the sky. You're not going to see stars like that unless you're away from city lights, huh. Look at that. Uh, should have brought a TV. You're a real city girl, aren't you? -Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm? She is a city girl. That's right. We've raised a city girl. You know what we need to do? We need to sing a campfire song. What? Seriously, let's go. "Kum by yah?" -Oh, no. -Come on. -Oh, I'm just kind of tired... -Ohh. One verse. Just sing one verse of "Kum by yah." Come on. No. -Come on, sit down, sit down. -Want me to walk your back? Need me to walk your back. ♪ Kum by yah my Lord ♪ I'm gonna walk her back. ♪ Kum by yah my Lord ♪ I'll sing it loud. ♪ Kum by yah kum by yah my Lord ♪ ♪ Kum by yah oh Lord ♪ [Sean] All you bears sing along! ♪ Kum by yah my Lord ♪ Hey, that thing getting stuck again? Yeah. All has gotten stuck right there. ♪ Kum by yah ♪♪ Come on, one verse. He maybe an awful singer, but at least he makes an effort right, mom? Yes, he does. Why don't you get a good night's sleep, okay. Don't let the bed bugs bite. -See you in the morning. -Night, mom. Night. Hey. Is she asleep? She will be soon. She was exhausted. -She had a good day. -Yeah, me too. -It was a great day. -It was a great day. So you really think this trip can solve our problems? I think it could be a good start, yeah. Do you, uh, remember when we used to pay our rent in change and we used have the big bag of nickels and quarters and... lint. Living in that dump over Cicero's on 8th? I can still smell the calzone coming through the floor. [laughs] The drunks and the transvestites screaming at each other on the street. We were afraid to go out at night and we had those thick bars on the windows. -That was bad. -Yeah, it was pretty bad. It's, uh... It's weird the way... I find myself walking by that place every once in a while. I don't know, I-I would do anything I would do anything to go back there. Me too. We could... or did I, I screw up time travel too. Sean? Yeah? What? Nothing. What? It's starting to get cold, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. [Richard] I'm sorry about your husband. Would you like a drink? No ring. Jill! Jill! Sean? Yeah? Never mind. [birds chirping] Sean! Olivia! What? What the heck? [Olivia] Oh, my God, I can't see it anywhere. How? I had a bowline hitch tied to that tree. What the hell happened? My God, are we stuck out here? Sean, people aren't expecting us back... Okay, let's just not start worrying now, okay? But there's no reception out here. Just stay calm please. -What are we gonna do here? -Calm down! -What are we gonna do? -Olivia, not now! Sean, don't talk to her like that. Oh, I'm sorry, am I stepping on your toes? -God! I'm out of here. -No, Liv. Come back, I don't want you going anywhere. Too late! Nice work. Okay, look, we're supposed to be working out some of our issues here, okay? So let's just leave her out of it. I am not the one that blew up on her. You did. Okay, fine, fine. Where are you going? Someplace else. Okay, I tied the boat up. You can blame me. I'm sure you will. But I tied it up. I am not blaming you. Liv, where are you? Liv? [Sean] Look, I'm sorry. Liv! [Olivia] Mom! Dad! [crow cawing] Hello-o-o? Mom! Da-a-ad! Hello? Who's there? Mom! [intense music] [twigs snapping] [yelling] Damn it! You scared the hell out of me! What are you doing here? Vegas, baby! How did you find me? I got your message and I rode out to stone lake and asked about the mill and I parked the bike cause I wanted to surprise you. Then when I started hiking I heard you... Oh, is this cool or what? No, no. This is a disaster. Our boat drifted away this morning and now we're stuck here. Mom and dad keep fighting and shouting... Just really glad you're here. You really did miss me, didn't you? That's not the point. We really need your help to get out of here. No, we really need to stay in the woods a little while longer. Liv? Zack? Mrs. D. What are the odds? You're unbelievable. But it's cool. Because I love your daughter. [Zack] That's why I'm here. Loving Olivia, that's one thing. Stealing our boat is not cool. -He didn't steal our boat, dad. -How do you know? Because he just got here. He told me. -And you believe him? -Yeah. Wow, which one of you guys is the good cop? That's not funny, okay, because stranding people in the wilderness is not a joke. Hey, look, I'm sorry if you think I ruined your family vacation, okay? but I didn't touch your boat. I-would, I would never endanger Olivia. I mean it. Why can't you believe him? It might be true. Okay, look, I'm parked about a mile from here at the old mill. I'll ride back into town and I'll get someone to send a boat or I'll have them follow me back down the logging trail. Alright, either way I'll have help here by night. Problem solved, right? And you're the hero, right? If I find out that you had anything to do with that boat... He didn't take our boat, dad. [Sean] That boat did not untie itself. Maybe you tied it wrong, or maybe you screwed up. The hell I did! Let's just all calm down. We're gonna figure this out. Are there any more buns? [Sean] No more buns. Zack... anything you can do to help us would be appreciated. No problem, Mrs. D. Anytime. You walk me out, Liv? Yeah. Great... great. [Sean] A very romantic interlude. Oh, I still think that punk stole our boat. [Jill] You don't know that. I'm here for you guys. [Sean] No, I don't know that. I believe it. I think it. And the reason I think it is because I had the boat secured. Knots just don't come undone, alright? Somebody untied it. You know this whole conversation is pointless. Bottom line is we are stuck out in the middle of nowhere and he's gonna help us. Okay, so now you're on his side? I'm not on anybody's side. I just want to get out of here. You guys are so predictable. Look, Olivia... Whatever. Can you relax? No, I won't relax. That's all I've done is sit back and do nothing. I just want to get us home. I just want to go home. You okay? Not really. Guess this didn't quite work out, huh? Hmm... Sean, I need to talk to you about something. Sure, about what? It's not just you. Hey, I know. I mean you start worrying about bills, you lose perspective... I did the same thing. Jill, I think it's great you went back to work. That's not what I mean. If I could take it back I would, but I can't. I'm sorry. Uh, what... What are you saying? [Jill] When I found out about you... you and her... Yeah? I met someone. And you don't know him, I don't know him he's... It was a mistake. Is this a... is this a joke? I'm just, what, how could you... I mean, how could you this and then you don't say anything? No, no, no, all this time I have been walking around with this... I mean, with this guilt! it's been ripping me apart, and then you go and you do this and then you give me your speeches. [Sean] Your guilt trips! Your blame! You started this! If you hadn't have been with her I never would have done that. I mean that is so mature. He started it! You're starting to sound like your daughter now. If anybody's acting like a child it's you. -What's wrong with you people? -Great! You're always trying to give me speeches and your holier than thou crap, and meanwhile you're doing this? Doing whatever with whoever? -Olivia... -No! I don't ever want you to tell me what's right and what's wrong ever again, because you know what, it didn't mean anything before and it sure as hell doesn't mean anything now. -Liv, please. -No, no, Liv. No, let's, oh, help our girl grow up. You can't even take care of yourselves! You're always trying to tell me about love and relationships. See, how stupid that sounds now? I'm not messed up. Look at you. What a family. I'll be back. Where are you going? Those are Zack's. Yeah, left them by the fire. He's not going far without them. We shouldn't split up. We should either all stay here together or all go together. Yeah, together, right, yeah. [Jill] Sean. I think he might have followed me here. Zack? No. [intense music] Who? Mom, who are you talking about? What makes you think he followed you? He followed us. That man... at the, uh, gas station. -Yeah. -The one you were talking to. And I think he might be unstable. I don't know what he might do. I told him right where we were going. You did? God! -I've gotta go find Zack. -No, no, no. -What? -No. Look, honey... I'll find Zack, I'll bring him back here we'll walk upstream and we will forget that we even thought about coming down here. No, this is a bad idea. We should all stay together. Don't worry, okay. I'll be back. Stay here. Oh, man, where did I put that key? Come on. Where the hell are you? Huh? Come on. [thunder rumbling] Oh, perfect. Perfect. -Lose something? -Oh! Dude! Uh, yeah, I can't find my keys. I didn't think there was anyone else out here. Neither did I. Kind of complicates things. What? Nice bike. Um... Do I know you? No. You don't. Hey, get away from my bike. It was supposed to be him. He was supposed to go for a long, long walk along that logging road, try to get some help. Would have been perfect and it would have been me and her and her daughter. Perfect family. New start. Now there's you. Okay, don't touch my bike. Okay, that's... that's messed up, man. Whoa, calm down. Wanna mess with my bike, pops? -Huh? -I'm sorry. I think we're a little past that right now... [intense music] [grunts] Hey, kid... Oh, my God. What have I done? [Richard] Oh, my God. What have I done? [thunder rumbling] [Olivia] Hey, mom? Yeah. Zack. Zack. Zack, you forgot... I know you. You're the guy with the family. Yeah, yeah. How's the family? They're good. At the end of the day it's all about family, isn't it? I mean, if you don't have a family... you don't have nothing. Look, I'm looking for the kid. She's really something that wife of yours, huh? It must be so nice to come home to after a long days work. Something about her... Her-her smell... not exactly her perfume. More like, what do you call it? A pher... A pheromone. All I know is no one's ever made me feel the way she made me feel but it really doesn't matter anymore cause she's mine. [grunting] [intense music] [Sean] Jill! Jill! [grunting continues] [yelling] [thuds] [Olivia] Is Zack gonna be okay? Zack is gonna be fine. Your dad's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I just... You know that thing with your dad, I... It, it was not about you. I can't believe that you and dad... It's just, I don't know what to think. I know, baby. We love you so much. It was not meant for you to overhear. You know at some point you realize that your parents are human, that they make mistakes they're not perfect... and I'm just afraid that you found that out way sooner than I hoped you would. I've got a really bad feeling. I think we need to go after them. No, baby, we need to stay right here and wait for them to come back. [sobbing] I wanna go home. Me too, Liv. [thunder rumbling] [Olivia] What are we gonna do? We're gonna stay right here. How long have they been gone? I don't know. So we're just gonna lie here and do nothing. Stop worrying. Everything is gonna be fine. I'm cold. Oh, baby, just stay close to me. Where are they, mom? [groans] [thunder rumbling] [grunting] [grunting] You were... You are the best thing that's ever happened to your dad and I. You were it. [groaning] When you were little we loved watching you grow. [intense music] Maybe we didn't allow you to grow enough. I love you so much, baby. Everything is going to be okay. You're safe. It's me. [screaming] Boy, the things we do for love, huh? And family. You know what the best part of this is? The best part is, we'll never have to ask "Where did it all go?" You're so beautiful. [whimpering] Oh... Oh, I-I-I almost forgot. I got, I got something for you. It's, uh, it's something you-you lost. Something very, very precious and... something... something your... your father gave you, right? Now... I'm giving it to you. [intense music] [panting] Oh, Richard. [Richard] Baby. [crying] Mom. No... [yelling] What are you doing? [thunder rumbling] Jill! Jill! Jill! Jill! -Jill. -Aah! I'm not, I'm not going to abandon you. We're family. I have a family. I have a husband. No. No. No. Not any more. What have you done? [Olivia] Dad! Dad! Somebody help me. Help me! Dad! Dad! -Olivia! Olivia! -Dad! Oh, God, you're okay, you're okay. Mom... and the guy, he's in the tent. Come on! [grunts] [Richard] You know what this is? This is a family argument. [Sean] You leave her alone! She's mine now. This is my family. [grunting] [intense music] Richard. [sobbing] [grunting] Let's go home. Okay. [Olivia sobbing] Mom... Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. [sobbing continues] [sighs] You know what? We need to get going. -Okay? -Okay. Come on. I'm sorry I never got to know Zack better. Me too. -Car's here. -Okay. Let's go. [sobbing] [engine turns over] [instrumental music playing] [music continues]
