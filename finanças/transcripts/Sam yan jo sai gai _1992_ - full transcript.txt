Forget it it's no point worrying now It's too good if this flat is mortgaged to BBC Even if it closes down we don't have to move for the time being You're too idealistic!

Steam it for you, OK? What are you looking at? Never seen a man naked? You're rude! You should knock the door first! What are you doing here? Why is he here? Can't you hear I am asking him? I thought you asked me why I am here! The towel is mine! So chicken-minded! Haven't you seen that?! Alex, I really don't know he has come How do I know whether you know or not! I only know that he has climbed up Climbing what? What are you talking about? We have done nothing! Nothing! You're only in your night wear, and he seems so tired He has just had a bath. And you look so pleasant I've seen you two You're with a naked man How do I know what you were doing with him! You and he also look so pleasant! You also said so I've never let any man see my naked body You are the first one! Your boyfriend is so great! He's not my boyfriend, he's my husband! Anyway, He and I are cleaner than the bleaching substance To be frank, |I've had an affair with her! But it's in the past!

There has to be a place to sleep in at night! OK! You tell me! What Should I do? I'd rather sleep on the street! Alex! You're narrow mined, stubborn, and self-centred But why did you marry him? He's much better than you! You just like to fool around with woman He doesn't like to fool around, and he doesn't have the bad habits that I have So what's the result? He's going at last! I'm going to screw someone Remember, all man is like that! Can you give me the passport? Passport! Still want one more? You've had 17 glasses, boss! I've not been a boss for a long time Don't excite him! He's already been so sad Can he be worse than me? I've to be a collie here! It seems that we're in the same boat How about a brothers' partnership? Aren't we sisters? Miss Chu, the gold price has slided down beyond the bottom line, shall we sell it You ask me? Mr. Tang has gone to Thailand He said you'll be responsible for everything Just a moment Grace...wait Grace. Who would know whether we shall sell it? Mr. Tang I don't know! But Mr. Tang has gone to Thailand! Miss Chu, Mr. Tang said whenever he has business trips I know, signing name! Come in Anything else? A regular meeting with the brokers in the afternoon and an appointment with the IC of the Bank Bureau You've to be present on behalf of Mr. Tang Also, Mr. Tang has reminded you to watch over the market Miss Chu, shall we sell it? Just a moment Do you mean not selling? No! Let me analyze the situation first Now, the market is trying to break through the psychological gate point I'll make the decision in a short while So when will you break through you own psychological gate point? Sit down and talk about it Miss Chu, you've to sign this financial report and the annual report at once I know I know. You go out first You also have to sign the cheques from the Accounting Dept You go out first, thank you In fact, the problem between you and Alex is just an psychological one Are you so free? Don't you have to go back to the office? Don't you have to record all the calls? Business can be done at any moment But it's more important to care about an old friend You don't have to convince me You see there's so much work to do So you'd better go But... No one can alter what |'ve decided Like a capable woman! What's the matter? The cheque is urgent, have you signed it? You tell him to wait for a while. Thank you Why don't you go? I'm afraid no one can call the ambulance if you suddenly has heart attack I say it clearly once more Just a moment What are you doing? I'm afraid I can't hear clearly, so I take it down I have no affair with Phillip He is mistaking Do you know why I'm working hard? I don't! Just for our family! It doesn't matter even if I work like a dog But even a dog needs master's care and love But now he said he's my fault. I've to comfort him I won't downgrade myself Where's your character gone? You wanted to get married so crazily Being a lady please This is the first time you downgraded yourself You word like a dog and no one praises you This is the second time you downgraded yourself I downgrade myself most to know you How can you talk shit to me at this moment! So it's the third time I downgrade myself So, you may continue downgrading yourself Go and comfort him Impossible! You should think it over seriously Psychological hurdles to overcome, No succeeding force... No succeeding force? OK. Sell it! Thanks There must be understanding between couples Like bullion speculation You have to know where is the psychological gate point You haven't married you know nothing about it Just knowing how to say it without knowing how to do it It's still better than your ignorance of both! What do you think? Vivian, you want to see Alex? Uncle, didn't you migrate to Canada? I get bored! So I come back to visit the old friends Is Dad's office upstairs? I come for the first time -No 99 I think it is -5th Floor... There are so many firms here is it here? Boss, come in is it hard to find? No! Just the staircase a bit awkward! You have a very strange smell That it can be easily followed To be honest, though your mouth smells bad I have been used to it It's boring to be without it in Canada You want to see Old Pa? Daddy! Her Old Pa and her dad is not the same! Shit! Where's Alex? He is meditating in the root garden Though the space is small, we live happily The meal is ready I'm coming It's so warm to eat at home We have a Philippine maid who does everything for us You little Ben! Don't call him Ben, his last name is Chow Don't trick me! We can't trick you only Alex can! Damn you! Go to hell! I don't go to hell! I go into your body I am going to find Alex Have the meal first Thanks "The heart is down and raining," "who can make love stay?" Do I sing lovely? Like an elephant which gets a cold How can I sing if you don't teach me? You are devoted to bullion speculation now Do you still have time for singing? You don't like me to be so money-minded? Me too! Whatever I think and do are for earning money Don't disturb me, I want to complete this song How is it? Alex Lui's piece must be good work! Shoe-shining! But I like it Do you still remember how you teach me singing? What? You want t go to the toilet? It's what you taught me Did 1? You said one must sing from deep inside And the mouth must be kept round Mom used to think that you tried to make a pass on me Though Mom sometimes is too wordy, she's quite good! If she's not good I would not have married her Furthermore, I quit smoking for her So you feel great relief as you can smoke now? You don't care her anymore? In fact it's not her fault I borrow this flat from my Old Pa It was raining Anyway now I feel good when smoking If Mom knows that Suki is looking after you She'll also be unhappy! I don't have any affair with Suki! Mom and Old Pa have also done nothing! They quarrel whenever they see each other! OK, I will quit smoking after I finish this one Do you know that cigarette is very expensive! You aren't angry with mom? Will aren't angry at her having a job? But she knows little about what she is doing You can teach her Just as you taught me singing is the past I don't know bullion speculation But ET, who had been my schoolmate for such a long time I have never seen him do a good thing I also feel that he's little bit strange Tomorrow I'm going to warm him not to make use of my wife He has gone to Thailand Thanks Mom You ask him to come Don't come if you're not willing to do so I have been used to have a living only with my daughter these years But I'm not used to it What I'll get married sooner or later? Then you'll be alone It's even better! Feeling light happy! Mom, we three can also live happily together. You shouldn't You sounds like |I've asked him to leave He himself decided to leave! Didn't he just come back? Why didn't he come in if he had been back This is Old Pa's flat How can you expect him to come in He feels jealous just because he loves you Where is he now? He is waiting for you at the old place The old place? So coincident I come to see you Really? Just smoke if you want to do so I won't mind We should be adjusted for each other Then I adjust for you No! I can adjust for you! Smoke it Well, but don't have to burn my beard Where is Vivian?
