♪ ♪ NARRATOR: On Tuesday, July 7th, the grounds of Ditman Hall State Training School were almost deserted. Except for the boys in solitary cells, the juvenile inmates were working on the building of a new road at the rear of the prison. A majority of the guards had been assigned to watch them. It was a moment that seemed made-to-order for what was to take place. With the prison weakly guarded, the first violent incident of open rebellion against the harsh and brutal administration in the prison was ready to explode. At 10 minutes after 3:00, a boy named Robert Glen, who had pleaded illness, sneaked out of the dormitory. In his possession was a key that he had made himself. It was a key that could lead some of the boys to freedom, or to sudden death. Hey, Eddie. How do you like this? -I told you I could make a key to get us out of here. -Okay. -You got the wrench? -Yeah. What about that screw at the gate? He was just letting the truck through. All right, now you get Pete out first, and then the other guys, and I'll meet you upstairs. [CLATTERING] -You think you'll make it? -I'll make it. Then I'll find a way to get the screw that did this to me. Okay, come on. Blow. Take the back road to get to the storm drain. Come on. Hello? This is Colonel Walton. [ALARM WAILING] The alarm! If they try to use those guns, teach them a lesson. Come on. You first, Pete. You're gonna need time. You gotta stay with us, we can't wait for you. Come on. They're in the drain. Get them before they reach the ramp. Come on! Whoa, give him a hand, come on. The screws! All right, they're asking for it. [CRIES OUT IN PAIN] [GROANING] You killed them, you lousy stinking screws, you killed them! Okay, round them up. The minute something like this happens, the administration is attacked by you newspaper men. We're blamed for the whole mess. The public elected me Governor for two successive terms, because it wanted me to crack down on crime in this state. We've tried to do that. Juvenile delinquency develops into adult crime. So, we cracked down on crime at its inception. How, by slugging the kids? Giving them slop for food? Not appropriating enough money for adequate training? We've done what we thought was right. All right, it hasn't worked out the way we wanted it to. -Changes are being made. -You firing Walton? No, no. Walton stays. What are you gonna do? Give him a raise for killing those two kids? Those boys had guns. They shot at Walton and the guards. If you're attempting to put halos over their heads, you're wrong. Walton is the best coordinator in the entire training school system. I can't afford to lose him. The public won't accept that. We're going to try new methods. Radical methods. If they work, the public will go along with them. You men know Dr. Paul Furman, from his work at overhauling the state probation program. Dr. Furman has just been appointed Special Adviser at Ditman to work with Walton. Will he still be taking his orders from Walton? He'll have complete jurisdiction and complete responsibility for the success or failure of his methods. It's being dumped square in your lap, Dr. Furman. How're you gonna handle it? Well, I've got lots of ideas. Some of them may be good, some of them may be bad. You'll find out. Those are human beings you're going to be experimenting with. That's right. Human beings with desires, fears, ambitions, inhibitions. You name it, they've got it. If you want a guarantee that what I'm going to do is going to be as simple as making two and two four, then deal with arithmetic, gentlemen, not human beings. Anything else? Yes. What'll be your first move at Ditman? Well, you can tell your readers, that I am experimenting with human beings. What I'm going to do is drastic. But I think the situation calls for something drastic. Ditman Hall will be the first reform institution to become co-educational. [BOYS CHEERING AND WHISTLING] All right, girls, hurry up. Be sure to bring all your luggage with you. Stand in front of the bus. Fast, fast, that's it. -Well, here we are. Bunch of female guinea pigs. -[CHUCKLES] At least from the sound of those boys, we don't look like guinea pigs. Come on, single file. What are you trying to do, prove you're a girl? Don't knock it, Miss Hartwell. They brought us here to make the boys feel at home, didn't they? You're holding up the line, Babe, get moving. Wise guy, huh, showing your leg. What, are you jealous? [BOYS WHISTLING] Not now, I'm not. BESS: Step lively. Get going. You guys keep away from that broad over there. Got my eye on her. -And nobody get in the way. -Yeah? If Eddie was out of the jug, you wouldn't talk so big. BESS: All right, girls. Single file around to the administration building. And be sure and make out your entrance card in triplicate. You wanna know what I think, Dr. Furman? I'll tell you what I think. I've seen stupidity before. I've seen hare-brained, crackpot ideas before. But I've never seen anything like this. I think you're a fool. And I think the Governor's a fool for letting you pull off this kind of a stunt. Does the Governor know how you feel? Got it in writing. And I also told him that I give eggheads like you just about three months to cut their own throats. You still think you can straighten these boys out with burlap parties, solitary wards, cruelty, killings? You know, Furman, the day will probably come when you'll be looking at the business end of a loaded gun or the sticking end of a knife. Let's hear what you have to say then about killings! Now look, Walton, I have to work with you, but I don't intend fighting you and the kids. If you don't want to help, fine. But just don't get in my way. Don't worry. You've got a free hand, as long as you represent the Governor. But when your ideas backfire, don't come running to me to show you how to use my kind of discipline. If these kids can't learn to discipline themselves, they're no good for society. If I can't teach them that, I can't teach them anything. Try teaching self-discipline to the punk who led the escape. -Eddie Bassett? -Yes. Just let him get near a gun again, Furman. I wanna see how your self-discipline works. Well, we know exactly where we stand, Walton. Exactly. You have any particular orders? Just one, for the present. Release Bassett and the rest of those boys from solitary. Are you completely crazy? You never can tell about eggheads, Colonel. Just release those kids. You were wrong, guys. That wasn't a skunk that came in here, it was the killer. -Shut up, Gerton. -Sure, killer, sure. You think I wanna get shot? All right, Bassett, out. -What for? -I said, get out. Let go of me, you crumb. Take it easy, you guys. You're being released from the ward. What are you gonna do, give us the chair? Nah, they're gonna let us run down the storm drain again, so they can use us for target practice. You're coming, Bassett. Is it on the level we're being turned loose? Those are the orders. Oh, that slug on the head must have shook Walton loose on a few brains. They're from Dr. Furman. Who's he, the new head screw? Are you coming, Bassett? You know, Pete was gonna get you for that beating you gave him. But he can't do it now. So maybe a few of the other guys are gonna have to figure out a way how. Just try something, Bassett, that's all I ask. Just try something. Oh, you've got a deal, killer. If you're smart, Bassett, you'll keep your nose clean from now on. Get over to the door. [GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Honey, you know how to make a bed better than that. Square corners. Miss Hartwell? -Yes, Babe? -Whose idea was this, a co-ed school? It certainly wasn't mine. I think it's like... Wow! Do we get to date the boys? Or are we just supposed to look at them? You'll do as you're told. BESS: Grace? I think you'd better let the kids get used to the idea. Fine idea this is. Even the girls are beginning to act like animals. Well, you know, there have been two sexes in the world for a long time now, and the last time I looked, the system was working out pretty well. I doubt if you'll ever be able to change it. [CHUCKLES] I don't want to change it. It's just that... -You know how I feel about these kind of boys. -Yes, of course I know. Look, why don't you run over to administration and see if you can pick up our training schedule? -If they've made one. -[SCOFFS] DR. FURMAN: Come in. -Dr. Furman? -In here. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -You're a supervisor? -Grace Hartwell. Can I pick up a schedule from you? If you'll just be seated. Thank you. Doctor, what did you expect to gain by bringing girls here? You object to normal relationships between boys and girls, Miss Hartwell? Normal, no. But I hardly call a corrective institution normal. That's right, Miss Hartwell. That's why I'd like Ditman to be as unlike an institution as possible. The only way we can do this is to eliminate the regimentation and monotony. The unnatural segregation of boys and girls. In other words, Doctor, our girls are here just for your experiment. Well, for their benefit as well as the boys'. That remains to be seen. What about sex criminals? What brought that up? You said, normal relationships. I don't think they are. Miss Hartwell, I've been in social work for a long time now. I've seen facts and figures. And one of those facts is, before you're assaulted by a sexual psychopath, you're more likely to be murdered by a member of your own family. Dr. Furman. I got in to social work because my younger sister wound up in a mental institution after she was attacked by a sex psychopath. I'm sorry. I guess then we're on opposite sides of the fence. I'm here to take orders, Doctor. Your schedule. I'd like it followed just as it is here. Very well, Doctor. It says here that the boys and girls are having breakfast together. As I said, Miss Hartwell. No segregation. This is very sudden, Doctor. The boys and girls aren't going to be ready for it. If trouble comes, we'd better be prepared. [GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Girls! Hurry it up. You've got exactly 14 minutes to get to the dining room for breakfast. And would you please try to act like ladies? These boys have enough ideas without you giving them any more. How about that shape, huh? Anybody would take me for 20, at least. Just fat, that's all. If I am, I'm getting fat in the right places. You know, I think I'll be a model when I get out of here. They make plenty of loot. Or maybe I'll go on the stage. Ma was on the stage. Yeah. Best striptease act in town. So that's bad? Ma always said, "You don't need a brain, "As long as you've got a shape." You're ready. Va-va-va-voom. So why'd your ma quit? She lose her tassels? Eh, she had me. And she didn't have her figure anymore. Ah, man. You should have seen her when I started getting the shape she used to have. Got so I was scared to be around her even. I was afraid to go home. What a temper. She was crazy. Okay, gals. That's enough gab. Let's get this show on the road. -[SIGHS] -Well, here we go, the big experiment. I'll feel a lot better when this morning's over. Come on, kids, hurry it up. Honey. This is not a coming out party. Stiff upper lip. -Well, I brought the stag line with me. -I see. Look, why don't you take over, I'm sure you can handle it. Now you all know we're trying something new here this morning. Boys and girls eating together. [GIRLS GIGGLING] Now you make this work, and Dr. Furman assures me that this will become a regular policy from now on. All right, everybody find your places. Boy, girl, boy, girl, and so on. Heard you've been trying to make yourself the big wheel while I've been in the ward. I am the big wheel now, Bassett. You think differently, and you're gonna lose a few teeth. [SCOFFS] I'll see you later. I'll be waiting. In the meantime, stay away from them two dames over there. Got my number on them. You're letting him get away with this? Hi, chicks. Don't move too far apart, the closer the better. -Man, listen to him. -Well, he really hot or something. Hey. BESS: What's going on over there? Why... Nothing, I just slipped, that's all. Didn't look like a slip to me. Like I said, I'll be waiting. Hi, you tall, dark and delinquent. You say you're taking me to the Ritz tonight? Uh, see you in about 11 months, baby, that's when I get out of here. I didn't get your name. File number 763127. [CHUCKLES] Otherwise known as Kitty Anderson. Kitty. Hey, that sounds pretty interesting, I'll have to read that file sometime. You know, I have a strange habit. I like to wear clothes on the street. Oh, good. Only trouble is, I couldn't pay for them, so I just helped myself. I mean, what's a girl supposed to do when there's no money in the house, forget about wearing clothes, or something? You know, you could catch a cold that way? [BOTH CHUCKLE] You know, I didn't get your name either. My name is Eddie Bassett. File number 389412... Something, I don't know. That's cute. Now tell me, just what got you your vacation in here? Would you believe it, $4.17? That's all this guy had left in the cash register. You know something, we lost money on the deal. The gun cost us $8. You're just a terrible businessman. Pretty bad. Hey. What are you trying to do, use up all his words before I get a chance to talk to him? Uh, something bothering you, blondie? Just that witch over there, honey. Now if you... Hey, hey, hey. I'm busy. You eat, huh? Now, where were we? I know where you are. You're nowhere. [KIDS SCREAMING] [ALL CLAMORING] [UTENSILS CLATTERING] Come on, come on, come on! All right, everyone! All right! BOYS: Screws! Screws! All right, take your places. Well, I hope you're satisfied, Furman. Your whole batty idea of having boys and girls eat together has got just what was coming to it. You can't treat this kids the way you treat the kid who lives next door. They're vicious. Every one of them has broken the law, or they wouldn't be here. I'll be filing a report to the Governor this afternoon. You might also inform the Governor that I've done some checking myself. Bad blood's existed between Eddie Bassett and the Killion boy ever since they were committed to Ditman. They were the only ones involved in the fight. If Bassett was still in the ward, there never would have been a fight. Now, are you calling off this deal of mixing the kids together at meals? As much as you'd like to see me admit failure, no. I'm not changing anything. Go right ahead, Furman. Dig your grave just as deep as you like. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Come in. -You wanted Bassett? -Get your hands off. Let him alone. He refused to come up here. That's why we had to drag him. Why did you refuse, Bassett? Look, screw, you wanna throw me in the ward, you just go ahead. Just don't give me any song and dance with it. I'd like to talk to Bassett alone. You'd better keep one of the guards with you. I said alone. If you need any help, just press the buzzer on your desk. All right. Sit down. I said I don't want any malarkey from you. And I said sit down. Well, let's get one thing straight, Eddie. I don't want any malarkey from you either. I don't get paid enough to take it from you. So go take a flying jump, then. Nobody asked you to come here. Just the Governor. He seems to think you kids are important enough. Is that why you hire screws like Walton to shoot kids? Two boys were killed. It could have been two guards. Those are the crumbs it should have been. Maybe you didn't know about Pete and some of those others being beat up. I knew. There will be no more beatings at Ditman. Now look, Eddie. I wanna give you a square deal. But I can't do it unless you let me. -Why me? -Because you're the leader. But don't think that makes you important. There's one like you in every school like Ditman. You'd like to find out how important I am, Doc. What's the matter with you, Eddie? -You like it here in reform school? -Oh, come on... Now what kind of a dopey question is that? Well, you act as though you never want to get out. Oh, I'll get out. I'll get out, Doc. And there won't be a cop or screw that'll ever get me back... -Are you through? -No. We're starting a new program here at Ditman, as of today. Now, I'm gonna give you a chance to stay with it, and make something out of yourself. But I'm just advising you, there are worse places in this state than Ditman. Walton could have you transferred to any one of them. You mean you would. Uh-uh. If that happens, then I'll quit my job. Because if you're a failure here, then I am too. You're cracked. What have I got to do with your staying here? Well, think about it for a while. When it sinks in, come back, we'll talk about it. That's all. You mean I can just... I can walk out of here? Without teeing off on me 'cause of this morning? I said you can go. No ward, no... [SIGHS] What about... Stu Killion? The same for him. You're a weird-y, Doc. Just don't make sense. NARRATOR: Paul Furman knew that Eddie Bassett lived by the usual code of a delinquent. Hit, or be hit. A code that grew out of deep resentment and hate. His only hope for Eddie was to learn what had caused this hate in the boy, and then try to remove it, before it warped his entire life. [GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] What's the word, Miss Monahan? Are they going to do anything to Eddie Bassett and that Stu character? Well, they're not exactly going to put them in the hall of fame, but nothing serious. -Well, hi, Cleopatra. -Huh? [LAUGHS] She had men fighting over her, too. Oh, I'm sorry about that, Miss Monahan. Frankly, honey, if I'd had men fighting over me when I was your age, I wouldn't have a job like this now. But, honey, this is a bad place to start trouble. Try and see that it doesn't happen again, huh? Yes, ma'am. I'll stay away from that crazy Stu Killion. What about Eddie Bassett? Do you know much about him, Miss Monahan? A little. I talked to Dr. Furman. He thinks Eddie has brains, if that's what you mean. KITTY: Maybe Dr. Furman could teach him a trade, or something. [CHUCKLES] Got your eye on the future? Well, I think Eddie's real cool. If that's what you mean. I mean I wish I was 16 again. But a boy with brains always has a chance. Remember that, Kitty. Okay, dolls. Lights out. You conniving little drip! I oughta cave you in! -What's the matter with you? -Oh, don't give me that innocent guff. Not after that line you had at Monahan about Eddie. What, are you making that your business? Eddie is my business. And I'm not letting you, or any other wise guy chick cut in. What's the matter? You're sore because Eddie forgot to look at your shape! You little... [GIRLS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] GIRLS: [SHOUTING] Get her! Get her! What's going on here? Cut it out! Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it, do you hear me? Get up! All right, Babe, what started this? Nothing. I'll get to you later. You're coming with me. Get up! Let's go. There. Now that will stop the bleeding. All right, you can go back to your dormitory now. -Are you sure you feel all right? -Oh, it's okay, honest. Thanks, Dr. Furman. You coming, Miss Hartwell? Oh, no, Kitty. You run along ahead. I want to talk to Dr. Furman. You wanna tell me that my policies are responsible for this. Would I be wrong? No. But I want to tell you that the fight in the dining room and the fight in the girls' dormitory is just about what I expected. Well, I was hoping you'd expect better results, Doctor. Officially perhaps, all the inmates here are your responsibility. But morally, Miss Monahan and I feel a responsibility to the girls. If you didn't, I wouldn't want you here. Thank you. You think that the boys and girls being here together like this is a dynamite situation. Do you believe that males and females can get along? Or has every man come to look like the man who attacked your sister? Doctor, you have no right to talk to me like that! I think I do, Miss Hartwell. You say that you have a moral responsibility to the girls. Well, I say you have one for the boys, too. They're also human beings, you know. I got into this work, Doctor, to help young girls. I didn't expect anything like this. Perhaps you'd rather replace me with someone more sympathetic to your views. May I call you Grace? If you want to. All right then, Grace. You know, I'd be an idiot if I thought that I could bring about these changes by myself. This is a team operation. I need the help of every man and woman on my staff. Now, the girls like you. I've seen that already. It's very important that we get the trust of every kid in this place. And now, our job is doubly hard. Because the two boys who were killed, because of the beatings, because of all the other mistreatment. No, I don't want to replace you. On the contrary, I want to feel that you'll back me up. To be honest, I... I don't see eye to eye with you. But I'll give you my word that I'll do everything possible to help. Well, that's good enough. And tomorrow, I'm giving personality and aptitude tests to the boys and girls. Undoubtedly, there will be some problems. I'd appreciate if you'd work along with me. All right, Doctor. I'd be glad to. Good night, Doctor. Good night, Grace. NARRATOR: Dr. Furman began a series of tests which he hoped would put the boys and girls on the right track to mental stability and security. Each test had its own meaning. Each test told Furman something new. At the conclusion of every individual series, he knew more about the boy or girl than the youngsters knew themselves. The results were encouraging. But the most difficult cases were yet to come. Well, these are our last three. So far, the reactions have been good. Let's hope it stays that way with our problem children here. Matches, Dink. When I snap my finger, you'll wake up. You won't remember anything we've said here, but you'll feel fine. Wake up. Hey, Doc, you mean that's all there is to this hypnotizm stuff? That's all. What did we do? I don't remember nothing. You gave me some information. You can leave now, boys. What's the matter with him? Is he tired or something? Oh, he'll be along in a minute. Thanks, boys. Yeah. Sure. Why are you holding him? Well, Eddie's our main problem, not those boys. They just follow him like sheep. Let's see what trouble we've really got. Eddie, when I touch your forehead, you'll wake up. You won't remember anything you've said here, but you'll feel fine. You understand? Wake up. Where's Dink and Matches? I finished with them, they left. You put me to sleep. What was the big idea? Well, I wanted you to tell me about yourself. You want to hear something of what you said? You mean you took down what I said on that thing? Well, just for us to hear, no one else. -I don't wanna hear nothing, I'm cutting out... -Wait, Eddie. What for? Look, lady, you're ganging up on me, and I don't like it. Nobody's ganging up on you. Dr. Furman's been doing tests on all the kids. -You mean all the kids are getting this jazz? -That's right. Most of them like the idea. [CLICKS TONGUE] They're squares. All right, Doc. You go ahead and have your fun. Eddie. I want your co-operation. This is the only way I can get it. Now, I'm going to play back part of the tape that I think's important. Listen closely. EDDIE: [ON TAPE] Yeah. I remember okay. I remember plenty. DR. FURMAN: [ON TAPE] You said it was your eighth birthday. Now why should that be so important to you? EDDIE: It was my birthday, all right. But my old man, he did all the celebrating. He came home, brought me a present. He slugged me in the mouth. I remember that ring he wore. I'll always remember that stinking ring on the hand he hit me with. That had to take four stitches in my lip. Two of my teeth were knocked out. DR. FURMAN: What did your mother do? She was too drunk herself to know what was happening. That's a lie! You tricked that up! I never said any of that stuff about my mother and father! You try to tell anybody I said that, man, I'll get you. Okay. You try to tell them now. Let's see how much proof you got. I feel sorry for him. Must have been like hitting an exposed nerve. Well, for his sake, I hope I can change him. You know, a kid can't cope with that much hate. It's just as tough on him as it is on everyone else around him. Not very clinical, Paul. What? I watched you during the tests. You weren't just a doctor to those boys. No? What was I? Oh. A Dutch uncle perhaps. You're the kind that... That scolds a boy, and then gives him money for ice cream. I'm glad you asked me to work with you, Paul. I... I think I'm beginning to see things differently. I was hoping you'd say that. Oh, I see. Rehabilitating me at the same time, huh? Well, I guess I owe you some ice cream, too. That a promise? I look forward to it. Are you, uh, announcing your new program tomorrow? 10:30 in the dining room. I'll be interested to hear what your plans are. I'll have all the girls there. Good luck, Paul. Thanks, Grace. [KIDS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Now what are the screws trying to pull? I don't know. But Walton and the killer look like they was at a wake. I'll see you guys later. It's the dame. How's Eddie expect to put the make on a chick in this place? [CHUCKLES] -Oh, hi. -Hi. I just heard about the rumble you had with that blonde chick last week. Yeah, well she oughta be scrambled, but good. -You okay? You're not hurt or anything, huh? -No. She's big, but no muscle. [BOTH CHUCKLE] What's the matter? Those two over there bug you, huh? What if they do? You string along with me, Babe darling, we'll be able to take care of both of them. How? They really bug ya. I'll figure something out. We'll figure it out together, huh, chick? Well. Here goes. -Good luck. -Thank you. Here it comes. Let it. Everything he does will backfire right in his teeth. I've seen these eggheads come and go before. [ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] All right, quiet! -DR. FURMAN: Quiet, please. -I hear he has big plans for us. Those screws have only one idea, and it's to stick their nose in everybody else's business. Quiet, please. Quiet! [SILENCE] Thanks. Now this won't take very long. I just want to tell you that we're gonna install a new training program here at Ditman. The idea is simply this. As of this minute, Ditman Hall is no longer a prison. [KIDS LAUGHING] [KIDS TALKING INDISTINCTLY] All right, all right. If you've got it out of your systems, I'll go on. Now, Ditman Hall costs the taxpayers a lot of money. Well, they want something for that money. When you get out of here, they expect you to be responsible citizens. Boys that know a trade, and can earn good money. Girls that can earn a decent living. Raise a family. Run a home. Man, what's that creep trying to feed us now? With our new training program here, we propose to do just that. We've completed our tests. Those of you who like to work with your hands, will be developed in that kind of training. Those of you who are artistic, creative, inventive, well, you can enroll in courses that will develop that kind of training. And so on down the line. For recreation, we'll have athletic events, movies twice a week, and a dance right here in the gym every two weeks. So what? This place is still nothing but a stinking pen. KIDS: Yeah! Something tells me he's got a little too much faith in human nature. [ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] I haven't finished yet! You only think you ain't, Doc. [ALL AGREEING] Want me to shut these punks up? Stay right here. As I've told some of you before, if I'm finished here, then you are, too. I've got just one more thing to tell you. There will be no more armed guards at Ditman. Starting tomorrow, all the guards are going to leave. They'll be replaced by new members of the training program. Don't worry. You'll be back. Did you hear that? Did you hear what he said? Aren't you glad? See you later, baby. You guys know what's happening? Sure! We're gonna have a ball. Those guards are leaving tomorrow. That means Andy gets out of here without us paying him back for beating Earl. It's him! Just left the main building. Look. That screw Andy's got it coming to him. We're gonna get him now. Now all of you guys, you keep your mouths shut. You ain't seen nothing and you ain't heard nothing. Come on, we'll wait 'til he passes the tool shed. Come on. Where is he? Let's wait for him by the fence. I hear him coming. It's the Doc. Eddie! Get out of here, Doc. Get out of here before you get hurt. What are you boys doing out of the dormitory? You wanna know how important I am? Well, I'll tell you how important I am. I run this joint. And you and no other screw are gonna get in my hair. Have you kids lost your minds? You thought you could stop us from getting that screw that killed Pete and Earl by having him shipped out of here. Well, you were wrong. I'm gonna give you one chance to get back to that dormitory. [GRUNTS] BOY: No, not the face! Don't mark him up. [ALL PANTING] Maybe we worked him over too good. We didn't have nothing against him. Got in my hair, didn't he? We gotta get that crumb Andy. Eddie, we'd better not take a chance. -Yeah, I had enough. I'm going back. -Yeah. What are you... Doc, you rat about this and I'll kill you. Bassett. I'm not even going to report you. Because I won't let one stupid, ungrateful kid like you ruin everything I'm trying to do. Just don't you push me, Doc. Don't worry. I won't push you. I'm just going to ignore you. While I help every other kid in this place make something out of themselves. And you can stand by and watch. Now get out of here. And don't you ever come near me again. You're no different than any other screw. You're all alike! NARRATOR: The recreational and training program introduced by Dr. Furman and his staff showed progress from the beginning. Most of the young prisoners responded well. Animosities and fears began to dissipate as they learned the value of teamwork. Of working and playing side by side. But it wasn't until the night of the first dance that Eddie Bassett participated in any of the activities. [SWING MUSIC PLAYING] Think we can find a few contortions to do to that music? Well, we could try. At least if I break any bones I'll be dancing with a doctor. You haven't even said 10 words since we got here. What do I have to do? Keep yakking away every minute? Huh? Okay, okay. We're supposed to be having a good time. That's the idea, isn't it? Yeah, with that Furman creep watching every move we make? What do you mean, creep? He's trying to give us a fair shake. Can't you give him a break? Oh, come on, huh? You're as cracked as he is. Paul, the Bassett boy just went out. Well, he knows no one is to leave this building. Get lost. I said, get lost! What's the idea? Nobody else is cutting in. -I just got a great idea, doll. -You always got ideas. No, no. This is a special one. Bassett and that Kitty dame. Let's do like we say. Looking for Eddie? -You making it your business? -Look, what are we knocking ourselves out for? You want Eddie? You got him. I got other deals. Look, are you leveling? Sure. I'm getting my kicks from that Stu character. Man, there's a cat that's gone. Did you see where Eddie went? He said for you to meet him down the hall, by the supply room. But we're not supposed to leave the gym. Suit yourself. He's waiting. Eddie? -Hiya, chick. -Stu! If you're looking for Eddie, he ain't coming. -Babe said... -What do we need Eddie for? -Gonna have a ball all by ourselves! -No... Fight! I like it when you fight. -No! -Fight! [KITTY WHIMPERS] You made me bleed, chick. You shouldn't have done that! Get up! Get up and let her alone! [KITTY SCREAMS] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [ALL CLAMORING] [KITTY SCREAMING] Killion! Have you lost your mind? -Thanks. -For nothing. Grace! Are you all right? Yes, Paul. I'm all right. Better help me with Kitty. All right, Kitty. Take it easy, you'll be all right. You all right, Kitty? Paul, we might have withstood anything but that. This scandal tops anything that ever happened at Ditman under the old administration. School association, religious groups, political factions, all applying pressures. And rightfully so. It's either your head or mine, I can't fight for you. I can't back you up. Nobody's told you the good we did there? Nobody would listen. What's happened is the unforgivable as far as the public is concerned. Rape is the great taboo. You know it, and I know it. I've told you before. The boy who committed the attack is a psycho. We proved that. He didn't belong at Ditman Hall in the first place. -Now that he's been transferred to a mental... -Oh, you can fight windmills, I'm not going to. It's over. Finished. I'm forced to ask you to resign. They used to burn witches at the stake. I'm glad I didn't live then. Goodbye, Governor. WALTON: [ON PA] This is Colonel Walton speaking. As of today, Ditman Hall is returning to its old schedule. [ALL BOOING] The exact status of every inmate will be the same as at the time that Dr. Furman took over here. [YELLING IN PROTEST] WALTON: The training program is discontinued. Guards are back to stay. [CONTINUES BOOING] The matrons will see that the girls are packed and ready to leave by 3:00 tomorrow afternoon. [ALL SHOUTING] That is all. Return to your duties. You tell Paul I told you so? I didn't want him to fail, Bess. He tried so hard. Well, back to our little manless world, girls. Come on, let's go. Okay, punks, vacation's over. Let's see how you like that extra 30 days solitary you got. You're gonna lose all your sunburn. Oh, just keep talking. Keep beating your gums. Get in. Come on! Yeah, alongside of Walton, you sound like an angel playing a harp. Oh, you ain't gonna dirty your hands hitting him, killer. -Where's your rubber hose? -Throw 'em in. Come on. Go on. I'll take care of this one, you can go. I said, you can go. You know the trouble with you, Bassett. You've never been softened up. That's why you think you're so tough. You gonna soften me, screw? Just enough so you know who's boss. Come on and get me, screw, come on and get me! [EDDIE GROANS] No! No! Let me out of here! Let me at that screw, I'll kill him! [CONTINUES GROANING] There you are, Bassett. All softened up. Maybe you'll remember this for a while. [ALARM WAILING] You creep! -What do we do now? -Get out, there's nothing else to do! Eddie, I'm not gonna get caught in a storm drain again. We'll get the front, Dink. This'll take care of the screws. Hello, Walton? Hurry it up. Quick, to the dormitory. Look, there's Eddie! That's right, Colonel. They're up in the boys' dorm now. Well, get them! This time those kids are gonna get what's coming to 'em. Colonel says go get 'em! The first screw that comes through that door is gonna get it! -Eddie, give up. We ain't got a chance. -No! [GUNSHOTS] -Look at those screws! -Man, we're really starting something! That's right. We really started something. You guys hear that? We started, and we're gonna finish it. Either we get Walton now, or he gets us. -What do we do? -We take over the joint! And we don't give it back, until we get Walton and those screws canned out of here. With a guarantee that they don't come back. -BOYS: Yeah! That's right! -Come on, start showing them! [ALL CLAMORING] Come on! Go on! [EDDIE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Hold it! Listen up! Hold it! Matches, you get the rest of the guys and start spreading the word. Great, let's go. -Now we grab Walton and the screws. -Yeah? The Governor wants to bargain, we bargain. With this pointing at Walton's gut. -Crazy, man. -Come on! [ALL CLAMORING] They're going crazy now, Colonel. Yeah, all of them. [CLAMORING CONTINUES] You better come down here with us. I'll be right down. Get the matrons out of there. Call the state police at Caster to send more men. Here. Get the killer out of the ward, and bring him to Walton's office. Come on. -Walton's gone! -Get the guns! Break it! Hey, Eddie, the matrons are still up in the dorm with the girls. All right, leave them there, the more hostages we got, the better. All right, Walton. Now you listen, and you listen good. EDDIE: [ON PA] We got Andy. If you wanna see him in one piece again, you get the Governor on the phone and you tell him we want a new deal here. You're quitting! And we want it in writing you ain't never coming back. You give it to us, or Andy gets it. And then the two matrons. All right, Walton, you got 10 minutes, now start making that call. [CLAMORING CONTINUES] Get me the Governor. Hey, you did it! -You guys see that? -Yeah. That's right, Governor. They're holding Andy hostage and the two matrons are in there with the girls. How can I give in to their demands? We can't condone a riot, Walton. It would only be a beginning. Well, something has to be done! Those kids mean business! I tell you, they'll kill Andy! Try to stall them for an hour. I'll be there by then. Make sure the state police keep the kids inside the gates. [CLAMORING] Hey, how do you like it, baby? The whole joint's ours! We're gonna get Walton and these screws fired out of here once and for all! Eddie, suppose the Governor doesn't give in? Look, please, please, will you put away the guns? Look, you might kill somebody, it'd mean your whole life. My life anything out of your pocket. Or out of anybody's pocket! Nobody cares about me! Eddie, you can't go around hating people all the time. You just can't! Oh, come on! You sound just like Furman! What have you been doing, reading his books? BOY: Car's coming! A big one! [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Five'll get you 10, it's the Governor. Right on time. Hey, killer, you must have been saying your prayers! Eddie! Get a load of this! The Governor's got Doc with him. Why did he bring him here for? Maybe the Doctor's coming back, Eddie. And the girls could stay, and then I could see you. I didn't expect to see Dr. Furman here. Walton, you asked me to think of something to save your guard's life. Paul is the only one I could turn to. Maybe he can help. He doesn't know if he can, and I don't know. But we're willing to try. Unless you have some other suggestions. Just what do you expect to do? I won't know until I talk to the boys. You're going in there with that gang of killers? That's the difference between us, Walton. You think they're killers, I don't. Just see that no one gets nervous with those guns. Boys, this is the Governor speaking. Dr. Furman is coming in to talk to you. You can speak your demands to him. Nobody's asking for you, Furman. Now you keep out of here. I'm warning you, Doc. You come in here, you're gonna wind up with Andy. BOY: He's still coming! Oh, that stupid crumb, why can't he listen? What's the matter, is he deaf or something? -Doc! Keep away! -Eddie, let him talk! Hear what he has to say. BOY: He just came into the building! All right. What do you think, you got special privileges or something walking in here like this? We want the Governor. First I'm taking Andy out of here. [ALL DISAGREEING] Sure, Doc. You just go ahead and try it. I'm gonna give you a chance to see just how important you are, Eddie. You can kill me and make yourself a big hero. Or you can hope for a break from the authorities by putting down that gun. I never asked any favors from you before, and I'm not starting now. Walton once called you kids a bunch of savage punks. Who needed disciplinary wards and beatings to teach you right from wrong. Well, this stupid riot here will prove to a lot of people that he was right. But there are some authorities and a lot of kids who wanted to see this program work. You only stopped us for the time being. The work will go on. We'll find ways. You mean characters like you are still gonna keep sticking their necks out. Maybe you haven't had a chance to learn this yet, Eddie. But there are more decent people in this world than there are bad. You can't beat them, they outnumber you, there are too many of them. Just a lot of gab. I don't know what you're talking about. I think Kitty does. Look, you don't hate everybody, not really, Eddie. You don't hate me. That shows you something, doesn't it? You gonna come back here, Doc? We'll see. Maybe the Governor will be in a good frame of mind. The Governor's waiting for us all to come out. NARRATOR: Dr. Furman had found the key to the hearts of the boys. He had made them realize that there was a decent world waiting for those who earned it. The riot did prove one point. That most juvenile delinquents need and want the kind of help that was given to them by Dr. Paul Furman. ♪
