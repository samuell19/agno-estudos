You want to put some money on it? I'm telling you, my brother can run faster than all you guys. He's so little. All right, five bucks. Let's go. Hey, Drew, come over here! Ready, set, go! Yeah, Drew. Nice job, there you go. All right, you guys all need to pay up. No, no, no. He cheated. Mom? Mom? What's wrong with dad? Dad! Dad! Good work, and then two more! You said four and we're done. I meant six. Or did you want eight? Complaining again, Jacobs? It's the same thing every day, asshole. You want to go for 12? Yeah, sure, I'll go for 12. We may lose Whitehall. Oh, I'm the loser? No, I think you're the loser, not like your brother. What'd you say? Hey! Enough! The hell with this. You run the laps yourself. You're done here. Let the loser go. Hey. Hey, Drew! Drew! Eric's just being an ass. Come back. Come on. Lisa! Come on back. We don't need him. Come on! I'm done with this. Go on, tell me what I missed. Same old thing. Whitehall's strides are too long, he needs to get up on his toes, and that girl runs on her heels. So you let that Jacobs kid go, huh? What's up, man? What's up, man? Drew. I'm gonna need you to pick something up from Eli tomorrow. Why don't you get in the car and do it yourself? You know why. A parolee can't be driving on these runs. Watch out. Mom's salary doesn't cover the mortgage. You're gonna have to start pulling your weight around here. And I don't want to see Eli right now. You don't have the money, do you? Hmm. You know... These are terrible. Ugh. Mm-mm. Can't do it. Oh, God. I can't eat it. Hey, sweetie. Why don't you go to bed? It's time for you to get moving. Let's go. You know that's impossible. I've tried it... Many times. Come on, let's go, ballerina. So Eli's got a bag for you, all right? What should I say about the money? Just tell him I couldn't get down there today. Hey, don't be too long. I got something else for you. Hey, Chuck. I'm here to see Eli. Flash. Want the shit? What's up, man? You're making a habit out of this. It's just part of your workout routine now. He runs all the way here from rainier valley, Chuck. You got some money for me? I'm just making a pick-up for Wes. Wes. That name sounds familiar to me. I feel like I know the guy. He never comes around here anymore, though. I think he must be mad at us, Chuck. It's not like that, man. Not like that? He's busy. It's not what you think. He asked me to make the pick-up... he's busy?! I'm busy! I hope I'm wrong, but I think we both know why he's not coming around here. You know what I can't get used to? People making decisions for me. Your brother's deciding who picks up what, when and where? I don't want to see your goddamn face here, Drew. I don't want to see your face. Tell your brother that. You understand me? Yeah. Go on. Chuck will sort you out. Be careful with that. Hey, Jacobs! You ran all the way from the docks? Same clip? Yeah, so? That's about a five-minute mile. That your school bag? Eli doesn't want me making runs anymore. He says he wants to see you. You know, he should really stick to gutting fish. Don't worry about me, though. I'm a big boy. A big boy can run his errands himself. You keep running your mouth like that, see where it gets you. You letting that Jacobs kid go... that was a bonehead move. I learned all my moves from you, Coleman. Drew, Lisa... Would you like to share your findings with the rest of the class? It's a trick question. It's x - 4, not 6 like you put in the formula. That's right. My dude! Shut up, peanut. What was that? That? That was easy. That was easy? Oh, okay. Wow. Excuse me. My head doesn't work like that. Um, I gotta go to track practice. I'll walk you. Men's relay is really struggling. They could use you out there. It's not gonna happen. I'm done with the team. Besides, coach wouldn't let me back. I don't... Get you. You could get a scholarship. Not if it means running for a jerk. What do you know about Coleman? I know he lives on my street, hassles coach Rickard, which makes him all right in my book. He used to coach track. I heard he was pretty legendary. Yeah, so? Well... Well what? Well, he's not coach Rickard. Lisa, I'm done with track, okay? Besides, I don't think Coleman's much use anymore anyways. He had this kid... he was a bit older than me. And then one day he was gone. Car accident. What are you gonna do, Drew? Just gonna give up? All right, varsity girls. Down on the field, let's go. Wes? Wes. Come on, man. What? Come on. Let's go. 30 yards, 20, 10... He did it! He broke the record! William Coleman has broken the state high school record! Wes! Look at this lawn, God damn it. How many times I gotta tell you to mow the lawn, son?! This goddamn lawn needs mowing! It's a jungle out here! Where's your goddamn lawnmower? I'll do it myself. Look, I know I owe you money, and I will get you the money. Just chill out. So this is where the magic happens, huh? This is where you smash your bitches? You know, I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. You're embarrassing me. Sit down. Oh, what's up, Drew? That's the guy right there. Big Drew. That's our boy. That's the future. He's a keeper. Oh, hey, cool. Baseball cards. We should trade. Chuck, do you collect? Flash, tell Chuck about your brother's ball-playing days. This guy... he could really play, seriously. Talented. The whole package. Could never hit that changeup, though, could you? Well, I'm not playing! I want my money. You think a five-minute mile is fast? Well, if you run ten of them, yeah. But you can't run with a temper. You gotta be in control. Or you beat yourself. Well, I never get beat, so... no? You're not on the track team anymore, are you? I'd say you got beat. But you are fast. Fast enough to win state? State fair, maybe. Quit worrying about who you're gonna beat. Running's not about that. Running's running. That's it. Is it? Yeah. Oh. Jeez, I'll have to read your book. Want to prove me wrong? Ballard locks, 5 P.M. Magnolia side. Get in the water. Get in the water. What? Get in the water. Seriously? Go on, get in the water. Go on. Why do I have to... get in the water. That's great. Thank you. Okay, that's good. That's good, that's good. Okay, see you those rocks down there? Run there and back in 15 seconds. That's it? You do 100 of them. Clock's running. Go. 18. Doesn't count. What do you mean, it doesn't count? Don't look at me. Go. Ah. That counts. Yeah. How many... how many have I done? How many? 54. That's it. I can't do it. You done? I'm done. I can't do any more. Where are you going? I was right. This stuff's impossible, man. Hey! ♪ Listen, I gotta cry ♪ ♪ 'cause cryin' ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ eases the pain, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ even this hurt I feel inside ♪ ♪ words could never explain ♪ ♪ I just wish it would rain ♪ ♪ oh, let it rain ♪ ♪ rain, rain, rain ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ let it rain ♪ ♪ oh, yeah ♪ ♪ let it rain ♪ come on, I need you to come with me. So get up, let's go. Let's go. This fool owes me a lot of money. So just keep your eyes peeled. You see anything, let me know. Where is the money? Huh? In the sofa. There we go. That wasn't hard. This what you're looking for? Huh? This? Yeah, I don't think so. Clean that shit up. Let's go. Let's go! Look, if I didn't need your help, I wouldn't ask for it. But it was worth it. Look at that. Mmm. I finished it. Even though I bonked. You bonked? Ha ha ha! Do you have any idea what bonking is? You didn't bonk. You got lazy. When you bonk, your muscles just run out of gas. You got nothin', nothin'... But your heart. Hmm. But... I've never seen anybody do more than 50 of those shuttle runs. Why'd you leave? Uh... Tell someone they can't do it, and they won't. Running's not just physical. It's in your head. Um... What do you know about boats? Which one's yours? We're walking to it. What's with the leg? You know the water's that way, right? Aren't you chatty? Sweet, huh? Wow. Yep. A couple of repairs, I think I'll take her to Alaska. Think this boat's gonna make it to Alaska? Get up there and wait for me. Go on, don't touch anything. I gotta see somebody in the office. You wait for me. Thank you. This guy makes me run in water, and then he takes me to his boat and drops me off. Sounds like he's a senile old man. Guess his glory days are behind him. Could still be your best shot at college, though. Let's play some basketball, yo. I think I'm done with it anyways, man. All right, let's go. Are you quitting? You don't much like being told what to do, do you? You don't listen, either. I heard. You told me to wait, and I did. I had to see if you were worth my time. Guess I got my answer. You still can't even tell me why. Patience. It takes a lot of it to be a runner. Are we going to the track? Absolutely not. I have my own special place. What are you doing? What the hell's it look like I'm doing? These are coaching shoes. Coaching shoes. Right. All right. Run down to the big white ship, turn left. That's your first interval. You get one minute's rest. Then the next 1/4 mile. Then you go all the way around these docks. All the way... come here. Now, see the pole with the sign on it? That's one square mile to the inch right there. All right? All right. You start at the cleat. Okay? All right. Go. What was my time? Don't worry about it. Was it under 50? Not that fast. Look, you got one minute to rest. Hey, slow down. You look like you just robbed a bank. Focus on each quarter, pace yourself. Quarter of what? Mile. Who's running the mile? You. No, I run the 400. Listen, you want a scholarship? You want to go to college? Yeah. Then you run the mile. The mile's your race. You run it fast enough, you can go anywhere you want. Can back on the line. Focus on each quarter. I just told you... get back on the line. Now. Oh, that's it. That's it. You averaged 67. That's not bad. I'm dying. I'm dying. You're not even close. You gotta run these in 58. All 10 in exactly 58. Ohh, God, this hurts so bad. Everything hurts! That's what's holding you back. The pain. You gotta learn to overcome it. You gotta embrace it, run through it. Then you can let it go. Run through it, right. Run through it. I'm dying! God, you're aggravating to be around sometimes. Jesus! Aah! God! Mom? Drew. He wouldn't let us take him to the hospital. Yeah, well, it seems like you have a pretty good handle on it. What should I do? I don't know. Call the cops. Want to walk with me? What happened to you, gimpy? It's a long story. What's that? This is an early acceptance letter to Cal Berkeley's art program. That's great. Congratulations. That's great. Thank you. It's awesome. It's expensive. And with my family... they can't afford it. If I don't get that scholarship, this doesn't really matter. It's... Bittersweet. Uh, but I can always become a street artist if it doesn't work out. At least I'm not gimpy. That's true, that's true. Well, I think you're very talented, so I think you'll be fine. Seriously, what happened? What's with the leg? I'm actually training again. You're running? Yeah. I've been training with Coleman. I'm impressed, Mr. Jacobs. In your hectic running schedule, do you have time for a birthday party? Yeah. At my house? Yeah, of course. It's, um... it's Friday night. Friday night. Mm-hmm. I'll be there. Bye. You're made for the mile, not the 400. And the sooner you realize that, the better off you're gonna be. I'm running the 400. Drew? Found. Ohh, boy. Let me see the guitar. Come on. This is it? That's it. Everything. This is the last time, man, I swear. I'll sing you a little running-away song. Goes a little something like this. A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three. ♪ His name was Drew and he had someplace to go ♪ hey, lazy George, you on break again? Let me get one of those. We good? Yeah. Hey, Calvin, go help our boy out. Hey, for this week. Flash. Good for this week. You know, if I'm your brother, I wouldn't send you around to see a guy like me. You wouldn't understand. Try me. Try me. Oh... That's for you. Look. That's for you. What'd you think? This is over? You were done? You think that's it? No, it's not like that. You're in this now. You, me and Wes... we're in it together. Would you like a cigarette? Give him a cigarette. Good for lung capacity. He ain't here. So you can just... Turn around and shuffle on home. What a prince. Wheeler-dealer, huh? I know what's going on here. I know who you are and where you're headed. Just don't take your brother with you. Ah, you're so pathetic. What's that? Hmm? We've got a deal, right? Yeah, we've got a deal. If I don't win, next time I'll run the mile, not the 400. Yep. I'm not losing this one. Training again. Watch and learn. All right, let's boogie, folks. We've got a special guest in the 400 today. You all remember Mr. Jacobs. Runners, to your marks. Set. Go! Come on. Come on, Whitehall. There you go. Took you long enough. You can't beat Whitehall in the 400. But if you train hard and listen to me, you'll be a great miler. Hey, Drew! You made it, man. Good to see you. What's crackin'? What's up? Good? You're being all antisocial. Bad race, right? Sorry, man. Hey, chill out, man. Chill out, man. It's a party. You need a drink. Come on, man. Yeah. Come on, baby, let's go. It's gonna be a good night. Hey, Lisa. Can I borrow her for one second? Hey, Drew's here. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, can I talk to you really quick, please? Are you sure? She's fine. Hey, how are you doing? I'm good. You look really sexy tonight. Hey, Eric, what the hell? Get out of here, man. Are you serious? Get the hell out, man. Get off him, man, come on. Chill, man. Drew. Come back in. He's gone. He had way too much to drink... don't make excuses for him. He's got his hands all over you. You're just gonna let him do that? Actually, I was about to... Take down Whitehall myself. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. So you're tough now? Am I tough now? Oh, like nails. Like... okay. About as dangerous as this eye. How is it? Um... Bad. Really? It's pretty. I should go. I gotta train in the morning. I'm gonna get back anyway. Okay. Good night. Good night. Coleman? You home? You forget practice? Some kind of a test again? It's a nice collection. You listen to all these? This your son? What? Were you as hard on him as you are on me? He must've hated you. You have no right to talk about my son. That's my son. What happened to your eye? I fell. You fell? Yeah. Oh. Yeah. You fell? Yeah. Hey... I hope she was worth it. You're still here, huh? How fast to get a scholarship to U.C. Berkeley? You don't have a chance. You don't listen. It took me this long to get you to do the mile. What if I run it in four? I'll do whatever you say. Don't cook anymore. Ugh. You got something. You got... you got something in here. It's so deep in there. And you gotta beat it. You gotta face that fear. You've got to. Because if you don't, you're gonna be me. And, buddy, you don't want that. But if you do, I don't care if you never run another race in your life, because if you do face that fear, it'll change your life. I promise you. It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do. But you gotta do it. Oh, you gotta do it. And then... You'll be able to push right through the pain. You'll go right through the door. And when you're about ready to pass out and your legs can't move and your lungs can't breathe and your eyes can't see, you'll know that it's just the beginning. And it's so beautiful. It's beautiful. That's all I've been trying to teach you. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. When do you want to start? You're gonna carry that tire underwater. That side to this side, 20 times. That's a start. Next time, you do it in one go. All right. 63, not bad. Not bad? That's four seconds faster than when I started. That was impressive. I hate to break it to you, but I don't think this boat will make it to Alaska. Oh, you don't? Why don't you just... Shut up and keep working? How about that? Why am I doing all the work? Well... Uh... Wax on, wax off. That's really good. Remind me again why I couldn't have the steak. You're not building muscle today. So... Here, I'll give you that. Oh, thank you. I don't eat it. I think I'm done. Can I get you guys anything else? A little more of this lovely pasta, darling. Keep eating. Mmm. So... How's it going with you and that girl? We're just friends. What? Eh... What? Oh, grow a pair. Why don't you grow a pair? Come out. Come on. It's so early. I know. You up for a run? That's actually pretty fast. Oh, is it? I didn't know that you played. I can play a song. Would you like to hear a song? I would love to hear a song.

He already has the state record. His coach thinks he'll break four minutes this year. Am I gonna have to race him? You're gonna have to beat him at regionals. Only the winner goes to state. St. James now increasing his lead as they come around for the final lap. My, oh, my. You know, I really appreciate you coming over. I know you've been spending a lot of time with Drew, and... why are you doing this? Well... Because he's fast. He's fast? Oh, he's fast, yeah. He's a really good kid. Um, I used to be a photographer. And this little boy used to sit for me for hours. No. Oh, yeah. He was a great subject. Really? But he would get so angry. Oh, my God. So surprising. I was six years old. You were wonderful. I got some beautiful images. Did you do these? Yeah. What is that bottom one? That's me. That cute boy. Fucking miserable. Oh, I loved photographing... Hey. Hi, mom. Hey. What's he doing here? Hmm? What's he doing here? Wes. What's he doing here? Hmm? No, sit your ass down, old man. Punk. What are you doing? No, no, no. So what's for dessert? James, I am so sorry. I don't know what to do. Look, I'm sorry, too. I... I don't want Drew to end up like his brother. But if he keeps running and he stays focused, he can get away from all that. Eli's money. I need you to run it to him tonight. You go yourself. I got a meet tomorrow. Good luck. You're still gonna run it to him. Right now. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. This isn't all of it, right? You're short. Looks like about half. If you were me, tell me what I'm supposed to do here. What would you do? Hmm? What? You leave. But this is not over for you. It's not over for your brother. The winner of today's race will go on to compete at the state championships. Stay with him... Whatever it takes. You give it everything. Now's the time, son. Leave everything on the track. Runners, take your marks. And into a smooth start is Charles St. James, as he goes out in front. Keep up! And newcomer Drew Jacobs is staying right on St. James' tail. Come on, Drew. Come on. Atta-boy. Come on. Keep up. Go! And it's St. James. Another great time. Charles St. James is going to the state championship. Coleman. You quit. You pulled up. You quit. Quit? That was the race of my life. Well, you quit. You gave up, I saw you. Look, I don't know if could've beaten the guy or not. That's not what I asked you to do. What I asked you to do is give it everything that you had. Someday you're gonna look back on this time, and you're gonna hate yourself. Because you didn't push harder, you didn't try harder, you didn't take this incredible opportunity that's been given to you. But now you got nothin'. And you've given me no reason to continue. There's no state championship. I'm done. You're done with me? I don't know why I ever listened to you, man. Why don't you take a look at yourself? You got nothin'. You got no family. So why don't you just go back to that piece-of-shit rat hole of yours and drink yourself to death? How could you send me to Eli's? How could you send me there, Wes? He's gonna come after us. You know that, right? I told you not to worry about Eli. He likes to make threats and... and cut you open. He is nothing special, Drew. When are you gonna stop lying to yourself? Lying to myself? You're one to talk, because that old man over there... he is not our father, Drew. I lost the race. Thanks for asking. Are you upset about the race? I'm fine. I know you're fine. I just need to be alone right now, okay? I get having bad days. But if it's about something else, you can... you can talk to me about it. Talk to you? Hey, what do you want me to say? You don't understand the first thing about what I go through, so just go back to your little doodles and your perfect life. I don't need to be fixed, okay? I'm not some pity project. I didn't think that you were one. Drew, get up. We gotta go. Drew, we gotta go. I'm not going anywhere, Wes. Drew... Don't piss me off, not today. What are you gonna do? Get your ass up! Do you want me out of this house, is that it? You gotta let go of this pathetic little dream of yours! Wes! Get off of me! Stop it! What was I supposed to do when dad died? What was I supposed to do? Let's this family fall apart? No. I'm the one who took care of everybody! You got something in here. It's so deep in there. And you gotta beat it. You gotta face that fear. You've got to. It's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do. If you do, it'll change your life. You'll be able to push right through the pain. Open that door. And when your legs can't move and your lungs can't breathe and your eyes can't see, you'll know that it's just the beginning. I did it. I did it. I ran... And I ran, and I ran. And I faced it. And then I just broke right through. And it was so beautiful. You were right. Wow. Good for you. You did it on your own. And that's just the beginning. Ohh. Will you do this for me? You still want to break four minutes? Hey... You don't need me. I'm asking for your help. You bet. You bet. No more riding in cars for you, son. Coleman said you could use a running partner. Did he? He's gonna need all the help he can get. Look, about the other day... you can make it up to me later. Want some water? Oh. Oh. Jeez, I'm so sorry. I keep... I'm just missing. I'm missing. Wes! Wesley! Wes! 911. What is your emergency? I think I made a mistake treating you like family, Wes. Stay inside. Wes. What the hell are you doing here? What do you think I'm doing here, huh? Huh? Oh, a slugger. Huh? Big hitter, here he is. That's more like it, big hitter. Not in my house, man. Who pays the bills on this house? Huh? Everything you got is 'cause of me. Hey, flash, who pays the bills on this house? Get back inside. How about I pop him in the leg? Get back inside! Go back in the house! Coleman! Coleman! Coleman! Coleman! Eli! Coleman. Coleman! Coleman! Are you okay? Are you okay? Look at me. Wes, go get help, please! Oh, God, you're hit. Oh, you're hit. Coleman, hold on. Where's my glasses? Wes, please, we need help, please! Please! Hold on, Coleman! Look at me! Hold on! Where's my glasses? Look at me. Please. Please. Look at me! Wes! Ohh! Help! Please! No! No! Please! Please! Hey. Do you know what I'm best at? Nothin'. Not a damn thing. I don't want you to come back here. Do not waste what you got. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you for coming today. You didn't have to miss the meet. I wouldn't be anywhere else. I wish you could've gone, though. I still think you could've beaten St. James. It's not about the meet. It's not about winning. It's not about St. James. There's something I gotta do. Welcome to the Washington state high school track and field championship. Today's the big day for all the best high school runners in the state. All eyes are on Charles St. James and whether he can break the four-minute mile and possibly beat the state high school record held by the late all-star miler William Coleman. I'm a poor substitute for Coleman. But since he can't be here... this counts as much as the state meet to me. How did you know? I knew you'd do this for him. Take this. Okay. Three, two, one... Go. St. James is once again taking the lead early. And as we move into lap 2, St. James still staying within record time. Last lap. St. James is still first. He's giving it all he can! He wants this record! St. James at 4:02! The record is still up for grabs! 3:57. Welcome to the N.C.A.A. Collegiate track and field championship. In Lane 1, we have Mike spade from Denver.
