It's silk. To match your shirt? I'm well covered. 1000 pesetas for the four. The latest fashion! Let's see if I can... What we've got here is... very important! I'm pleased. I worked hard on this project. I'm a bit nervous. Anyway. You can... Iook carefully. As you see, there are no partitions in the offices. That way, people can communicate better. What's going on here? What's all this? I'm sorry... I'm very impressed... by you. I think... I think I love you. I've got... a family problem. What's more important? That or...? Come with me, please! One minute, gentlemen! Impacted? Impressed? I'm very impressed too. Two months of work... and now you've spoilt it all. I'm impacted! I'm impressed! I don't understand. You don't? You'll understand! I like you a lot... but I have to go, ok? Thanks a lot for fucking it all up! May I have a sweet, please? Fine... you've seen the plans. If everything is in order... He's... my brother... The dogs! Hang on, the dogs! Wait. Stop. Really it's not funny! Where are we going? Stop it. Stop it. I'm begging you. Ok. Get in. You get in first! What I've heard was beautiful. Sorry, mister.

I'll go to the hotel. No, you were good! No, you two have a coffee. It's better! And it's her birthday today. Yeah. We'll give her a gift. Maybe you're the gift? I'm no gift. Sit down! - What's your name? - What? - What's your name? - Sansa. Sansa (without his). Without what? - Without house. - Without wife, mother? Go on. Tell us. Tell us. You want to! It's obvious. Look how you're laughing. You make me laugh. Me? I'm funny? - Anyway, it was... - What? Impressive... what you do. Look! Two ballerinas. What a wonder! You're a star, Mr. Click! Where are we going now? Look, it's Hagi! See... Look! No need to worry! Don't worry, be happy! Imagine it's a 1000 foot drop! I'm on a tightrope! How to find the living among the dead, the dead among the living? What a story... Where was her grave? Wait, I wonder... let's go over there. You can't read it anymore. They got a plan at the entrance? The plan. It was Mr. Eichmann who made the plan. That train there might be the train... that took my family away. - Unbelievable. - Was your mum called Click? She had a dream, well, a nightmare... that her child would be something special. Do you realize? You live with that, it never leaves you. Never. We can't see anything. Thanks. Can't you find her? What was your mother's name? I didn't know her, Manon raised me. A grandmother from Montmartre. Well I'm happy. That's funny, strange... I look at your face, it's like a... Where are you? Here? I was like you, I loved... for a long time, and then things came and went... I was in love... Now I try, well you could almost say... I try not to be in love, but rather to love. But that's not so easy. Ok, that's enough. - Is it real? - Yes. I like it a lot... My hair? Can I smell it? I like it! It's mythical. - It's beautiful? - Yes, mythical also. I never saw such hair. What's going on? I was touching it 'cause... She's an Egyptian goddess... She's Cleopatra reincarnated! And that's just mythical! Look at you! Look at her! Look. See the difference. Mythical! No, be cool. No, I touched... Sorry! Quick, quick! Mister! Wake up! Wake up! Shit! You can't sleep here! Why are you sleeping here? What time is it? Five o'clock! Wake me up at six... At six o'clock! One hour! Just one hour? That's all. Good night. - What's its name? - Cuba. Like the island. Are you hurt? No problem... No. It's ok. Such lovely hair... It's funny, you look like somebody I know. Would you come to my concert tonight? At the Scala. You remind me of somebody. Flowers? The palace of great music! Fazzari, what are we doing? Me, Joseph Click, they won't let me in. I cancel! What President? Invest. Always invest. Where is the music? We have to invest and there's nothing here! Fantastic! Diog¨¨nes said: The more I know men, the more I love my dog. Of course... The backstage entrance? Good evening. I'm a friend of Mr. Click's. - I come with you? - Yes. Come. Disinfectant. Who's hurt himself? Disinfectant? It's not an open cut. Hurt? The eyes... magnifico! And the smile... You too. Good luck. You too. One for you, one for him. St-Petersburg? Like this or like that? I'm lost. To love! Oh my God, what is it? Just tell me the truth. I can't, I can't anymore! And you? You got a lighter? You kiss well. Caught him! Work! Work! She touches his chest, his chest is powerful. Left side is stronger than his right... as a boy he had to carry trees. Hard childhood... his family sold flour, carrying flour sacks... his right chest became stronger than his left. He did all that so that 68 years later, Olga... could touch his tit... strong and black. Look... But she's also touching the right one! In the middle! I've got him! What are you doing here? - I just dropped in. - What do you mean? They won't let me in... I thought Stalin was dead. They'll give you a room. I won't sleep where they want to kill me! Fuck off! You see, you arrive at a difficult time for me. I don't know what to do. Don't know. Look how beautiful it is! Does he play the violin? You're strong! You'll spin people like that? We're tied and don't know it. - I'm not tied. - Of course you're tied. They're revolutionary songs... Come on! How do you travel? On a winged horse or a flying carpet? What do you want? No. I got a bit lost. - Lost? - I'm trying to find myself. You are here. We can leave it all. I can drop the orchestra... Got a rehearsal at the Marjinsky. Got to go. I don't understand... That way? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You like passports here... Let him go, we'll get nothing out of him, he's an artist. Ok man? You ok, brother? You lived here long? Yeah. Been here... cool like, and then, I get by, nice and quiet like, cool... Have to take off shoes. It's a friend, in the shit... Let him... sleep here, easy style. - Come on, man. - Is it ok? Yeah. Come on! Customs asked for my passport and then... locked up... Jail. But over there, it's fucked up, man. It'll be cool. Yeah, cool. But just cool... Have a rest. Yeah, I'll go to bed. - 'Night, bro. - Thanks. Yeah. See you tomorrow. I'm a conductor! Unbelievable! A shit passport. He wants to pass. You can't come in! Corruption doesn't work here. In some countries, yes! But not here! My dear friend, we're all citizens of the world, I'll let you pass. But remember, if you're in trouble, don't mention me. I don't know you, it wasn't me you saw today! Nice trip and up to you to get out! Ten thousand for the marijuana, ok? Ten thousand, ok? I don't understand. Haven't got any. Come in! It's you? Sit down. What's new? - You ok? - Fine, and you? Dunno... Why are you cooped up alone? I dunno... I'm never alone when I'm with this. But I have a concert tonight... I don't want to do it. Telephone... Always the telephone. - Shower and let's go out. - Had it. Unbelievable! Without asking me! They're nuts. I'm dreaming! Arrange it. It's over. I want to leave... Get away from it all! To Ibiza with... Paloma! Oh no, the telephone again. You're really something! Dunno how you do it, but I must say... Where are these shitty musicians! It looks like a hotel room. I often quote things... - Just scribbling. - Scribbling? There are those bastards! The musicians aren't here. Don't get upset. I deal with it. I've worked with Mr. Click for many years. No rehearsal, no concert. No concert, big problems for you, for you... We'll find a solution! I got two hours. He needs four hours. I like you. Three hours. No more. You're fantastic. See. It's easy to conduct, you stand and just follow the orchestra. Where are you? Why? Tell me why, why all this? Here, look at that figure. Look how she walks, how her hair floats in the air. That feline walk, just look! Come with me, I can't, I'm too shy. You prefer him or me? Shut up. We're talking about me, not you. Blah blah, he talks a lot. He knows nothing... What are you talking about? You're annoying, leave us alone. - Wanna fight? - Want to be alone with her? - He's very nervous. - I'm not! Calm down! Ok, I'm calming down. And him? - I'm going to dance. - Dance? You dance? Fantastic! It's so beautiful! I love that stuff! That one's for you! - So kind! - See how I care... - Don't cry my little one. - Stop. - You're really something. - Let's go! - Is it good? - Fantastic. Just look at that. Wonderful! - Come on, hurry up! - Wait. Stop fussing around! You're my friend. Don't talk at the same time. I'm watching life go by... What? Wipe your mouth... A little kiss? - No. - A little one. I can't give a kiss! - Fantastic! - Jingle bells. - Look. - The one with the hands! Take your gloves off. You speak with the hands! What's going on? What's going on, what? Blah blah with her! Why? Wanna fight him? - Idiot, shit! - It's ok. He thinks he owns her. What is that? - He'll fuck you up. - So what! She's mine! She's free! We're really having fun! - I'm off. - No. I'm scared. - Don't be scared! - But I am. - Stop. - I swear! Subtitles: CN5566 Traslated by leaf
