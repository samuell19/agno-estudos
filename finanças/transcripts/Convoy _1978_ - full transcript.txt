I should have known that'd be you on the other end of that two-way. - What two-way? - The CB, Cotton Mouth. Couldn't have been me. I ain't got no CB. Besides, I don't believe in police entrapment. Come on. Cotton Mouth ain't a snake. Son of a bitch! Beached belly whale, you. Now, I could write you up for doing 75. (Chuckles) But, uh... just for the sake of agreement and old times, let's just say you were doing, uh... 70? - Which could come to about, uh... - (Spider Mike)... about 35. Plus the insurance goes up another 100. Might be just a bit more than that. For Christ's sake, Lyle, come on! Now, if you boys wanna take your chances in court, hell, I got me a real nice jail. I'll impound your rigs, all safe and sound, and they'll just sit there. - How much is it, Lyle? - 50. Each. You rummy bastard! 60. Hey, take it easy. This ain't an auction, man. Who gives a shit? I make more than him anyway. (Spider Mike) Well, it wipes me out. I can't even eat. I'm doing my job, keeping my part of the highway safe. Yeah, well, you keep it safe in a ditch somewhere, feeding flies. - 70! - My ass! Hey, cool it! I can't call on any more of them raises, y'all. Let's get outta here before he takes something else. Easy come, easy go. Hey, Lyle, you gonna be one of us pretty soon, you know. - How's that? - Ain't you heard? The Teamsters are gonna be organising the cops. Not this one. I don't want no part of your damn union. They ain't my damn union, Lyle. I'm independent, remember? At least we got one thing in common. Two. There ain't many of us left. (Horn blares) (Love Machine) That's some fun-loving bear you got there. Where the hell you meet this guy? (Duck) Uh, we go all the way back.

(Violet) Why is all this stuff on the table? We havin' a garage sale or something? (Melissa) I'm just trying to get it all into one bag, as I plan to travel light. Oh! She sellin' this stuff? No, honey, she's a bird of plumage. She's giving away her feathers. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - (Duck) Tell Violet I'm coming in. - 10-4. - $3 and a salad. - (Both laugh) Hey, Violet! The Duck is on his way. Woo, my birthday boy is coming. Now, there's a ride for you. If my cab doesn't show up, I'll sure think about it. - 2,000. I'm sorry it couldn't be more. - I wouldn't. He's a lotta trouble. But that thing out there needs a total rewire. - This is gorgeous. - Here, you should have this. - (Melissa) It'll be great with your hair. - (Mechanic) I gotta buy foreign parts... Listen, I wouldn't give this away if I was you. Here you go, miss. I'm taking a hell of a beating. Oh, sure you are(!) Don't you wanna see my ID, my driver's licence or nothing? Blow, baby. (Playing on jukebox) "Lucille" by Kenny Rogers OK, we're down to this. Who wants it? I'll take it. How much? - $5. - Ten. - 12. - 15. Are you kidding? - Fight over it. - (Chuckling) Hey, Duck. How's it, Jack? - Fine. - Fill her up, will you? I heard that. (Black Widow) This won't fit you. You know that red thing you wanted? That'd look much better on you. No man, this will swallow you up. Well, that's the style. Hi, Duck! Good. Fill her up, Thelma. Hi. Can I help you? Look here! Mmm... Sugar. Mmm... - Did you miss me? - I sure did. - Ouch! - Mmm... - Take it someplace else, you know? - See what you made me do? How's my black widow? Oh, I'm still a widow, but I cannot complain. - What's going on here? - Oh, Melissa, this is the Duck. She needs a ride. - What happened to the XKE? - I sold it. How do you two know each other? This is the guy I told you about. The one that told the cop that I was nude driving. - Oh, I should've known. - He get you? Well, after his proposition, I sent him to the motel of his choice where I think he's probably still waiting for me. (Laughing) - Did you ever ride in a truck? - No. Do you want to? Maybe. Come on, honey, I got a little birthday surprise for you. I bet you do. Don't you leave without me. - You ain't mad at me, are you? - Me mad at you? - Watch me. - Watch how I handle this. Come on. - That's my ride? - That's it, honey. Come on, baby, don't be like that. You know my heart belongs to you, Violet. Oh, yeah, sure, for about one hot second. Hey, well, that's not my fault, is it now? When are you gonna get rid of that sorry old man of yours? He's not so sorry. He's just had a little hard luck, that's all. Yeah, and I'm looking at the very worst part of it, ain't I? (Chuckles) - My handle's Love Machine. - (Spider Mike) No! Uh-uh! Miss, his name is Pig Pen. That's temporary. No, you just wait right there. I'll let you know when you can come in. I hear you're looking for a ride, a nice lady like you. She already has one with the Duck. Thank you, anyway. I'll take your bags to the truck then. Oh, Pig Pen, uh... excuse me, Love Machine. Just, it's his birthday, honey. Give him a break. - Come on, let's go have that salad. - Allow me. Thank you. - I think she likes me. - Yeah, it's obvious, man(!) (Violet) OK, it's ready. You can come in now. Help me unwrap the present? What am I supposed to do? Hey, Pig Pen, look outside, man. What do you think that fat slob is up to? Checking plates, I imagine. Ooh, come here. Watch what I do here. Hey, Mike, come here. - Man, I'm always game for some fun. - What is he doing? Mmm, never mess with a cop. How did you know it was my birthday, anyway? I know a lot of things about you. - You do, huh? - Mm-hmm. (Love Machine) 'Breaker, can you hear me? ' Anybody? Over. Say yeah. (Spider Mike) 'Yeah, I hear you.' 'There's a cop cruising along, checking plates.' You know who that damn bear is? That's dirty Lyle. 'Ain't he a heavy mother, though? ' 'Hey man, Boulder Belly isn't heavy. 'Boulder Belly is fat. There's a big difference.' Watch when he gets outta the car and starts bouncing around. Looks like a beach ball a little bit. Turkey face. 'He bounces like a quasi-beaver.' (Spider Mike) 'I'll be damned. I should have known. 'That's probably why he stoops so low to get cash. 'He's saving for one of those sex operations.' (Crockery rattling) Hey, here he comes, guys. (Love Machine) 'Very nice talkin' to you, good buddy.' - 'My pleasure.' - 'Over and out.' (Horn blares) Here. (Sniffles) Hey, Duck. Duck! Where's the Duck? What Duck? (Chuckles) (Black Widow) Duck! 'We got Lyle in here, man, and uh... ' and he's got pain written all over his face. Pig Pen. (Chuckles) How much cash you got in your pocket? I still got enough, thank you. Duck, I don't know what you're doing, but you'd better get your ass in here. Hey, baby, I'm sorry. I gotta go. Hey, boy. - (Lyle) 'How are you fixed? ' - Son of a bitch! Sorry, man, but I don't have nothing. - You know that. - Mmm-hmm. (Chuckles) Well, in that case then, young fella, I'm just gonna have to arrest you for vagrancy. Stand up and lean against that counter. (Shouts) I said stand up! - You heard me. Get up! - (Duck) Hey, hey, hey, hey. Thanks, friends. You all sure know how to mess up a birthday party, man. It's late now, so let's just be getting out of here. You too, darling. Go get your things. I'm so sorry about... Hold it! Hold it! Hey, come on, man. They ain't breaking no law. What's the matter? Your boy is going crazy, man. He's trying to bust me on some bullshit vagrancy charge. - And I'm not going to no goddamn jail. - Oh? My old lady's having a baby, man. I gotta get home. - Oh... - It's the truth, Lyle. She's over nine months gone, man, and she's about to drop. Anybody know who the father is? Now, get over there. (Spider Mike) You fat bastard! Let me go! I want to take that! You, son of a... Dammit! Well, you blew Arizona. You all better get to your trucks. Yeah, you, too. Yeah. (Cop) All right, freeze! We got real trouble now, man. Stand aside. - I waited for you. - My car broke down. Excuse me, please. - Get back! - Hey! - Hey! - Oooh! Wait. (Grunting) Ooooh! Runyon! (Moaning) Ooooh! Did you see that? Put it on their bill. Let's break this up!

Get back! Ow! Get him! I got him, Pack! I'll eat your ears off, you big son of a bitch! - Come on. - That ain't no cop. - That's a mule wearing a uniform. - Hell of a fight, Duck. (Panting) Thanks. Gimme a hand here. Come on, Pack, don't waste no time. Come on, let's hit it. Let's go! Kick the sucker in. Go on! Get it! You can do it, Pig Pen! Hey, Bobby! You'd do better yankin' the wires on that thing. All right! Let's get the other wires. Open up, that. - Pull them suckers out! - Get them plug wires. Come on! Tear 'em out. (Grunting) They ain't going nowhere in this one! - (Black Widow) Hey, come on, man! - Get that distributor outta there. Get the whole damn mess. Let's take it all with us. Let's get it all. Let's go. - Where you goin'? - State line. Yeah, why the hell not? - We goin' with 'em? - Let's go. - Let's go! - (Cheering) Let's get the hell out of here! Let's go! Move 'em out! Happy birthday. Take care. (Engines revving) (Horns honking) (Lyle) Don't just stand here like a bunch of dummies! See if you can find my gun! - If I get you out on the road... - (Violet) Here it is! (Lyle) "Here it is!" Bring it over here! Jesus Christ! Where the Hell have you been? Come on! Help me get the hell out of here! See if you can get a hacksaw, anything! You son of a b... (Waitress) I got it - a nail file! Uh? A nail file? Well, you know what you can do with your nail file! (Gun shot) Oh wait, wait! Wait! (Grunting) - I'll talk to you later. - OK. - Hey, come on! - Get out of here, you dumb... Any one of you jerks got a car? You got any keys? Don't just stand there! Come on, will ya? Hey! Hey, hold it, will ya? - Let's get rid of that stuff! - Hey, I need your car! I'm commandeering your car. Hey kid I'm sorry, I'm...

Get out of here! Go on, get out of there! Get the hell out of here! I'll be back after your ass! (Engine starting) (Engine revving) (Pig Pen) 'Breaker, breaker. How's that nose of yours, Duck? 'It sure was pushing that cop around.' Yeah, I got a kind of slow start there. I don't think it's broke, though. (Spider Mike) 'Hey, Duck, we was just getting wound up, weren't we? ' (Duck) 'We were just fixin' to bother him to death, 'till the Widow Woman kicked his lights out.' You'd better move your ass. (Laughing) How we travellin', Duck? 'We're gonna get a certain amount of attention real soon.' (Duck) 'Remember that old road we used to use 'when we was working with Sharkey? 'There's just about room enough on it for us, man. 'I think it'll give us a clean shot to the state line.' You got the White Rat here. I think ol' Pack can handle that. - 'All right, Duck. 10-4.' - 'You got the Lizard Tongue here. - 'Who have we got with us? ' - 'Old Iguana here! 'I'm a lecherous old lizard with love on my mind! ' (Melissa) I'm supposed to catch a plane to Dallas. - To do what? - To photograph a wedding. Well, you're not gonna be catching no plane for a while. (Lyle) Hey! (Honking horn) Come on! Get out of there, will you? Come on! Hey! Where's your turning signal? (Honking horn) Where's your turn? Get the hell out of the way! You dumb... Give me something to wipe this shit off my face, will you? You want some coffee? Fuck. (Horn blaring) Good, cos we ain't got any, I forgot it. (Engine revving) 'We're coming up on a hard left here.' We'll be going through a four-way intersection. OK. (Honking horn) (Horns blaring) (Tyre blows) Let's get her out of there! - You all right, baby? Got your key off? - I don't know, man! (Duck) Jesus. - Is she all right? - Let me go and see. Just get my stuff, please. - You OK, miss? - Yeah, I'm OK, I think. Goddam piece of white junk! I knew I should have bought myself a black truck! Well, come on, let's haul ass! (Black Widow) Y'all just got yourself a passenger! (Duck) 'Hey Widow, you all right? ' 'Yeah, I'm fine. I got a bruised butt' and a black eye, but I'm OK. (Horn blaring) Oh! Holy jumpin'... That's one! That's one! Ah-ah! That's one! It's that crazy cop from Natosha. (Tyres screeching) Hey, get me one of those T-shirts, will you? Aaaah! - Oooh! - Watch it! (Chickens clucking) (Moaning) (Pack Rat) Holy Christ! I swear that was Lyle Wallace! Lyle? Uh, Rubber Duck here. Is that you back there, Lyle? You got your ears on, good buddy? (Coughing) I hear you. Are you OK? You need a meat wagon or somethin'? (Panting) You'll need somethin' else, you son of a bitch, once I get my hands on you! Hey, until you get a little better control over that machinery, 'I'd suggest you lay off them acrobatics.' Yeah, well, listen, I'm gonna have the State Police in on this. And when we do, we're gonna lunch on your ass, you son of a bitch! 'Hey, I'm sorry, Lyle. You're coming in real broken and garbled.' Uh, besides that, you gotta catch us first, right? Ten years. I figure it at ten years, with a little time off for good behaviour. This is Lyle Wallace, Natosha County Sheriff's Office. Need assistance. (Siren blares) 'I'm down by the old farmhouse on 109.' Amen. Well, I think I've had about enough of this, thank you very much. I think I'll just take my things and get out. If you wanna pull over, I'm sure I can hitch a ride very easily. OK, I'm ready. Weren't you listening to me? I said I'm ready to get out! You want out? We're being chased. If you want out, jump! Do you want to add the Mann Act to your collection? Mann Act's for 18-year-olds. Not... someone who's seen the best side of 30. (Sirens blaring) (Tyres screeching) (Groans) My name is Bob Bookman, sir, and I hate truckers. Lyle Wallace, Sheriff's Office, Natosha County. Ah, get your hands off me! It's around here somewhere.

(White Rat) Hell, it ain't even that. (Black Widow) Would you do me a favour? (Choking) Would you roll up that window, man? - The window's broke! - Shit. (Melissa) I get it. An invisible escape route. They'll never catch us now(!) Exactly. Now, here's the plan. When we get up to the pass, we'll put on our fish costumes. I'll hand out the Vaseline and an extra ration of rum for the men. That should do it. There they are. Lead car! Lead car! 'Take that dirt road off to your right! ' - God! Look at all this dust! - Roll your window up, dummy! Hey, uh, this is the Duck to the Pig Pen. You all still with us back there? 'My water bed is sloshin' around like it's gonna break.' Hasn't had this much action since I caught those twins in Carlsbad. I'm just followin' your smell, Pig Pen. - Watch your turn! - (Black Widow) Oooh! Jesus Christ! Why don't you watch what you're doing? (Pack Rat) Shut up or you drive the son of a bitch. (Laughing) Tell him to get on one side or the other. (Bookman) 'Lead car, get on one side of the road or the other.' Well now, what's he stopped for? (Coughing) Dammit! Well, we can't wait now. Watch it! (White Rat) You're gonna turn this damn thing over! (Pack Rat) Shut up! There's no point in gettin' mad, OK? - I ain't mad, I'm scared to death! - (Laughing) I know. I got 'em, Chief! I got 'em! (Screaming) Jesus Christ! - What happened to him? - I don't know. He's pulled off here for some reason or another. Them cops ain't up to par today on their drivin'. One just went over the side. There's some in bad trouble, Duck. 'They're falling all over the road over here. (♪ Waltz) (♪ Waltz continues) Feels good, I tell you that! Ooooh!

Well, Pig Pen, I think he deserves a break today, what do you say? Why don't we just, uh... let him on through, don't ya know? Hey, that's a big 10-4. (Siren blaring) Aaah! Ah, smartening up, huh? (Love Machine) 'How about we close this door? I'm gettin' a draught! ' (Bookman) Go back! Jesus Christ! Looks like they're making a sandwich outta the sheriff back there. Goddammit! - (Bookman) Unhook us! - (Lyle) I can't, we're hooked up! You must have a bear trap, Pig Pen, cos you sure have caught one! - Get down! Get down! - Shut up, will you?

I'm a special assistant and press representative for Governor Haskins of New Mexico. I'd like you to know that Governor Haskins has had a long-time interest in the problems of the trucking industry and would like to help work out some of those problems. Which ones does he have in mind? Over. We'd like to know, is this convoy... some sort of protest demonstration? And if it is, what's its purpose? The purpose of the convoy is to keep movin'. Ask him why he wants to know. You wanna run this? Hey, look, I'm a little busy right now, as you can see. Why don't you try and talk to some of them back there? All right, will do, Rubber Duck, uh... I'll be back to you later. - (Arnoldi) 10-4. - Good buddy(!) 'This is Chuck Arnoldi of the Governor's Office, sir. - 'I wonder if I could talk to you. - 'Call me Old Iguana.' 'Old Iguana, eh? Where were you born, sir? ' Originally? (Iguana) 'I've been driving 18-wheelers as long as... ' How about it? - Think I oughta talk to him? - Yeah, I do. We're sick and tired of beatin' our eyeballs out coast to coast and havin' the damn Smokies rip us off for our green stamps. So you believe in what the Rubber Duck's doing, is that it? I'm tired of seein' the way black people have to live. 'Went to Vietnam and got shot for the right to live in a ghetto.' (Trucker) 'I go from A to B. 'The faster I can get from A to B the more money I make. 'At 55, I can't deal with it.'

Thank you very much! Sir, I wonder if I could ask you why you're in this convoy with the Rubber Duck. Well, I'm just along to kick ass and for the ride. Yeah, but, well, uh, surely you must have some kind of personal grievance against the laws of this state? No, I just like kickin' ass. You sure are a pretty red-headed little boy.

Can I talk to you again, please? Uh, this is the Duck, Chuck. What did you learn? I learned a lot. Now look, the Governor is very interested in meeting with you, personally. He is prepared to fly here at once and get together with all of you. So we've set aside a field here in Albuquerque where you can spend the night. Now look, the police have orders not to bother you. That's the truth! Bullshit! Can I level with you? - Level with me. - I want to talk to him off the record. I don't want this on the television. I don't want this printed. - Can you hear me? - Yeah. The Governor has been requested to call out the National Guard on you. But this is an election year and the Governor wants to... hell, he expects to be part of it, on a Senatorial level. These people out here watching you. Do you know who they are, what they are? Do you? They're voters! How it's gonna look to them if the Governor tells the army to blow the shit out of your convoy? Maybe you can help him. Maybe he can help you! (Camera clicking) Do we have any choice? (Thunder rumbles) 'Spider Mike callin' the Duck. Say Duck, I just got a skip from my home 20.

Just plain old trash. - No, average people. - Trash! To tell you the truth, Henry, I think this damn convoy has more public support than we do. Bring in Sheriff Wallace. I'm afraid Sheriff Wallace left for Texas in a hurry. Texas? Well, what the hell is he going to do in Texas?

You're not gonna get no pictures. You know what you can do with your money? No, you take your body out of here. Your cameras, too. - Hey, you made good time, Lyle. - Yeah, I had a pretty good pilot. A little tired, though. Here he is, Lyle. Boy, you sure are one dumb black son of a bitch! You got here a little late for the fun. You would have enjoyed it. Man, you sure know how to hurt. You resisted arrest. I'll plead guilty, whatever you say. (Gasping) Just don't hit me anymore. I didn't hit you. I helped you up. Thank you, sir, but I don't need any more of your help. Let's go, Lyle. Yeah. Listen boy, if I hear anything about your kid I'll let you know. Looks like you're gonna be with us for a while. What for? Bait. What happens, Lyle, when he brings all those trucks? Ah, he won't do that. Not his style.
