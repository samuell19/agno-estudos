Hey, are you giving your mum lip? Ali? Can l come? This car's Muslims Only. Mia isn't a Muslim. No. Muslims and Danish Girls Only. OK? Why isn't he answering, then? Because he's waiting for me downstairs. lt's because he's sleeping off his drink, Aksel. Hi, Dad, it's Aksel. l'm on my way. l'm coming. l want to go on holiday ... Has anyone seen my necklace? - l want to go on holiday. Aksel, put a sock in it. - Come on, he's all cut up. He's giving me ear ache. l've lost my necklace. He thought he was going on holiday, OK?

But l refuse. l had it on when l went to bed. And l can't find it. And it was from Ali. Have you seen it? Remind Ali that you have to be 1 8 to drive a car in Denmark. And watch your damned toast! Allah, Allah ... What are you doing? - What do you think? Asking Allah to send me on holiday. OK ... so you're a Muslim? Last month you were Superman. The cool dudes are all Muslims.

Can you help back stage? - What do you think? Our band's a girls band. - And now it's a boys band, too. Lars, l'd much rather be with them. We don't want babies. - Aksel, they don't want anything. The lazy lads will be the jury. You'll have to dress up in girl's clothes, then. The show's on Saturday at 1 . Bring the family, right? Testing! lf l sing you can be the chorus. Why? - Because l'm cool. Why have you got that? - Because l'm a Muslim. Danes can't be Muslims. - Oh, yes, they can.

We'll all sing We'll write a song And at the contest We'll win a gong. lt's got to be about love. - Have you ever been in love? l don't remember. - l was, once. Where we used to live. With a boy called Kristoffer. Kristoffer, Kristoffer, She can't keep her fingers off yer You're horrid. Just leave off. We'd better sing about death and destruction. They hate love. How do you know? - Um ... Hey, stop! Love songs only. Or you'll come last. Toto! - l'm coming. Love songs only. What did he want? - Nothing ... Hey, girls! Wait for me! l'm coming! Lovely doggie!

''Brothers and sisters, mums and dads welcome!'' Would you like me to sew your costumes? No, Mum! - Oh, no, just look at them! You should ask Fatima over. lsn't she a bit scatty? - No more than you are. l expect that when dad's business picks up - - we'll move back again. l'm not moving back again. - See you tomorrow! See you tomorrow! Fatima! Fatima! lf you're interested we'll sort something out for you. Hi, Claus! Fatima, pop down to the basement for the laundry, there's a love. l'll write this first, OK? l'm not playing any more. - You're a poor loser. Are we trying to sell a whole country or just a car? Fatima! - Hey! l'm on the phone! l promised Mustafa you'd take him. Pop down to the basement. Fatima, please! Then she'll shut up! Go on! Get the laundry! - You get it. l'm writing an essay. - A love letter, more like. You kick me again and l'll ... Buzz off! Give it back! So you nicked it! Get out of my bathroom! - No!

And you can have ten kroner. - Where are you going? None of your business. And l can wear it for the song contest? No, only tonight. - Right, l'll tell on you. And if you follow me l'll land you one ... lf you go out, don't forget your keys. You've got no wheels, though. ... Let's go. Get out of my car, pal! Chill! - l don't like visitors. l've got you something. How sweet! - lt's a poem. ''Life without love ...'' ''Like an angel without wings, Like a ring without a finger ... Hey, what's that? Can l see? Leave it till later. - Oh! Can l come? - What are you at? Nice necklace. - Because l'm a Muslim. You are? ln that case you can come for a ride. l never said he could borrow it. - You did! You little liar! Take it off. But if you want to come you have to say this ... ''l'm a donkey''. l'm a donkey. - No, ''l'm a donkey'' ... With a bit of practice you'll be able to come with us. l thought we'd agreed? - Coming, you guys? So what are you doing here? Mia! Mia! Mia, l left my keys behind! Mia! l need to phone mum. l've locked myself out. OK, dial 0 first. She didn't answer? - No. l'll call my dad. Yeah? Hello? Didn't he answer either? - No. He must be out. Where are you going? Have a seat. l didn't think Muslims drank. l have to drink or l'll die. Not alcohol, though. Can l have some? Of course. You thought you weren't allowed to? Not since l became a Muslim. - You've become a Muslim? Yes. Why? - Because it's cool. So you'll be driving too fast, stealing, and joining gangs? Yes. l don't believe in God, though. A Muslim who doesn't believe in God? That's news. l believe in Allah. - He's the same God. l thought they were different. You'll need some phrases in Arabic, too. ''l am a donkey''. Who taught you that? - Ali. My son Ali? Do you know what it means? lt means ''l am a donkey''. What would you like? - A number 36 with extra chilli. 36 with extra chilli. Right. Good morning, Aksel. - Good morning. Fatima, wake Ali up. He's not to sleep all day. l'm coming. l phoned your mum. She knows you're here. Your mum was really angry with your sister. Ali, get up! - Good morning, Fatima. Hi, Aksel. You fell asleep? l think so. Have you written our song? Nor have l. What did he ask you? - Nothing. What did she ask you? - lf you liked coffee. Do you like it? - lt's delicious. She asked ''What song?'' - And you lied to her? No song. - Aksel, what is this song? lt's only the club song contest. Oh, no. Nothing. What are you doing with my mobile? - Song contest? At a club? The club song contest. - Singing? At a club? Dad said l could. - What did l say you could? The club song contest. - Yes. She's allowed. What on earth ... - What's wrong with that? She wants to sing at a club! ln some Song Protest or something. What are they on about? - Whether l can sing at the club. l said she wasn't allowed to. - We'll see about that. Dad says l can. - Fatima! Go to your room! Anything to do with the kids has to be discussed with me! She's so mean! - What did she say? That she'd give me one more chance to be in the contest - - and l should be grateful for being allowed to go to the club at all. She can't even ride a bike. - She can't? Aren't Muslims allowed to? - Hi, Aksel. Hi, Bono. lt won't bite. - l'm not allowed to touch dogs. Me neither. - Why not? Because mum's allergic. - Because l'm a Muslim. Where are you going? l'm not touching that dog. l'm a decent Muslim. Muslims have to help anyone in need. lt's true! We've only got frozen food. - My dad's got loads of meat. Come! Come! Hey! Beat it! Beat it! We can make money from our song and buy dog food. By the time we've written it he'll have starved to death. l've got some words. They just need some adjustments. Life without love ... Like an angel without wings Like a ring without a finger l can't sing that. Some girl wrote it. My brother did. Life without love ... - ''From Ali to Mia''. l got it off the computer. He was writing an essay. That's not an essay. - l know it isn't. lt's a love poem for your sister. - lt'll make her even worse. Without you life's no game Life without love Where can we sing it? - This place mum worked at once. With these old rich people. They gave her loads of stuff. Life without love ls a lonely life ls a lousy life Without taste or colour Life without love ... - lt's for a starving dog. Thank you. l'll take one of these, all right? Thank you. 2 kroner 25. - 2 kroner 25? And a cigar. That wasn't very much. There'll be decent food for you at last! Hello ... you look very happy! About your marriage ... 1 35 ... Who was that? - The lmam. What's an lmam? - He tells Muslims what to do. You know the mosque? That's where he's from. l'm not allowed near dogs. - He didn't say anything. lf he wanted he could snap his fingers - - and l'd never be allowed outside again. How awful! - He looked all right. lf he comes back, l don't know about the dog. He won't hurt you. He can see l'm a good Muslim. Of course he can't! - He can! You look like a Dane who eats liver paste. And loads of people have necklaces like that. And l've never seen a Muslim in trousers like those. What's wrong with them? - They're so naff. Do you think they're naff, too? - Only a little bit. Where are you going? - To buy some dog food. And then to the club. l've had enough of you two. They are naff. - Very. So why did you say ''Only a little bit''? We can call him Kristoffer. Kristoffer, Kristoffer, She can't keep her fingers off yer What are you at? Aren't they cool? They're just like Ali's. Where is the dog food? - The dog food? Why didn't you buy any? - l saw these cool pants. They only had one pair my size. Take them back. Right now! l can't. - Why not? - Because ... - Because what? The dog needs food. - We gave him some biscuits. That's not proper dog food. - You want me to walk round naked? You can wear your old trousers. - l binned them. They were naff. Get those pants off or sing on your own. What are you doing? Hey, stop it! Stop it! - Off with the trousers, Aksel! No! You've got to. Get on with it. Sing! OK! All right, all right! Like an angel without wings Like a ring without a finger What's that? - Listen! Like crying without tears That's how l feel, my love - lt's ... When you're not with me ... l want to see you soon Because l miss you Miss you so Life without love ls a lonely life, a lousy life Without taste or colour Life without love Aksel, get down. Come here! - Aksel! Aksel, stop! - Come back! Where did you get that song? - Your computer. Did l say you could? - Sorry! l bet ... We're going home. Mum and dad will be thrilled. What a mess! There, Kristoffer. You were so hungry! We've got more for you. l'm sure they'll cool down soon. l washed seven times. - That's not the point. You were meant to be at the club, not at the mall singing with a dog! The dog didn't sing. Don't laugh. ... Look at me. The point is that we can't trust you any more. What have you done! lt's so shameful for us! The dog needed rescuing. - You should have phoned the RSPCA. Perhaps you are just stupid? - The lmam didn't say anything. The lmam? Did you run into him, too? l didn't see him. No, l bet you were up to something else. You're going nowhere from now on. No club. You're grounded. You said l could be in the song contest. Sit down! Not when l can't trust you. You can't trust Ali, either. With his filthy love letters! Go to your room! Go on! She's awful. Sit down. Where are you going? Finish that essay. And l'll look at it. lt was so embarrassing. So embarrassing. lt wasn't me. - Ali wrote those words for me. And you brayed them across the mall. lt sounds pretty amazing. lt wasn't me. - Who was it, then? You know this boy who looks just like me? So much that Annika and Fatima thought it was me? He's a bit weird. Give me my necklace. l need it for the song contest. - Give it to me. Seeing it on you drives me nuts. Why can't you keep your fingers off my things? lf you sing it even once more ... And it's your fault l can't see Ali again this week! You may be a teeny bit to blame for that. Why do you always gang up on me? Excuse me. l've got such an awful itch. lt's my allergy. - Oh? There's nothing in the food. - lt's as if we had an animal ... l haven't been near any animals. - Me neither. Are you sure? l haven't! - All right ... You can't be allergic to the goldfish, surely? Goodness! l'm really sorry. - That's OK. But will you come to the song contest on Saturday? Song contest? Sure. l'd love to. 'Bye, then, dad. - 'Bye. See you on Saturday. Come over here. You can't see her. - Why not? She's grunted. l've been bad. Mum and dad say l've got to stay indoors for the rest of the week. - Fatima! - But l'll get out. Come and help me instead of talking out there. Go on practicing. Because l'll be there. And we'll win ... ... the club song contest! 'Bye, then, Aksel. - 'Bye, Mustafa. Great. Never again will l Mean nothing We're better. - We aren't. Listen! One day she'll meet ... lt's OK her not being here. She isn't much of a singer. She's better than you. - No, she's not. And you should do something about your singing. You keep singing flat. - l what ? You sing flat. - Thanks a bunch. Where are you going? - lt's no fun without Fatima. But my dad's coming on Saturday. - You'll have to sing on your own. What if l get hold of Fatima? - She's grounded. l can just ask the lmam. - The lmam! The guy who tells Muslims what to do. Do you know where the lmam is? - What? Do you know where the lmam is? The lmam? Upstairs. Office Yes? What do you want? l'd like to ask you something. - l'm busy. Come back later. Muslims have to help people in need. She's got to be in the song contest. ''Got to be'' ... There's so much we think we've got to do, but ... Aren't you sorry for the other two? Doing the song contest on their own? Without me? - You're thinking of them? They might come last. My darling ... They'll manage without you, eh, darling? l am a Muslim, too. - So you've said the creed? What's that? - lf not, you're not a Muslim. Hi, Annika! Like an angel without wings Like a ring without a finger Have you seen my charger? There is no god except Allah and Mohammad is his messenger. You what? There is no god except Allah and Mohammad is his messenger. Have you seen it? - No. There is no god except Allah ... ... and Mohammad is his messenger. You have to believe it ... and learn a lot about lslam. And you need your father's permission. That's no problem. - You think he'll let you? He lets me do anything. When can l see him? lt's just a house he's borrowing. Dad! Dad! Hi, Aksel. Who's this? The lmam. Oh? OK. Hello. Rickard. l wasn't expecting visitors. Are you from the club? - No, l'm an imam. A Muslim priest. From the local mosque. - Oh? Right. Well, come on in. Thank you. lt's just a house l'm borrowing ... l'll take it. - Thanks. No, thanks, l don't drink. - Right. Of course not. He's allowed soft drinks. - Want one? No, thanks. l think it sounds all right. You wanting to become a Muslim. At any rate it's better than collecting Pokemon cards. Not that you can compare ... - Not quite. But it's good to have something to hang onto in life. Quite right. Calm down, all right? This will look good on Fatima. This one? This is almost identical. lt'd look good on Fatima - - and that one would look good on you. You always wear pink. Allah is greatest and Mohammed is his prophet ... ... Am l a Muslim now? No ... Mohammed is God's prophet. - Hi, Aksel. Hi, Annika. - Did you ask the lmam? Yes. - What did he say about Fatima? Fatima? - Yes, Fatima. Fatima ... - Fatima! The song contest! Oh, right. The song contest. Fatima. l've got it all under control. You deal with the dog, l'll deal with Fatima, OK? Oh, right. - l'm on top of it. Yes. OK. ... 'Bye, then. You want to sing to us or something? - You want to come to prayers? To prayers? - Yes. At the mosque. Now? - Yes. Now. You must be crazy. - What does he want? He wants me to go to prayers! - Well, it's been a while. Yes, Aksel. Take him along. ... Ali's going to the mosque! We have to wash first. We wash three times, all right? - Right up our noses? Just a splash. ... OK? And a bit on your hair. Do your ears at the same time. All that's left now is our arms. Don't we have to wash our tummies? - No, that's not necessary. They're hopefully clean. Like this ... Yes, to pray you need to be clean. Leave your shoes here. Right foot first. That's it. Just do what l do. Your arms! - My arms. You'll have to take on a new name. You know that? You can't go round being called Aksel if you're a Muslim. You need an Arab name. And you have to pray at the times on the list. You can't eat pork. And you'll have to be circumcised. lt's all a load of trouble. Don't worry, it's only a little snip. Know what l think? This car is cool. Ali, you need doing over. The way you drive! What you saw was perfect parking. Who's that? - Muslim Aksel. Taught him some new words? - Yep. Say them, Aksel. Allah is the great ... And Mohammed is his prophet. - Nice one, Aksel! lt sounded all wrong. Only kidding. lt sounded OK. Didn't it? - Yep ... Muslims can touch dogs. - Fatima said she couldn't. That's because our granny said so. But it's all right. Some strict Muslims just say it isn't. ln our family we can pat them but they mustn't lick us. Or come indoors. OK? - OK ... Stay cool. See you later. Say hi to Mia. 'Bye, then. See you later. 'Bye. l've been out in Ali's car. - Fatima's got to sing with us. ''Got to''? There's so much we think we've got to do. But it isn't always so necessary after all. Do you see? No, l don't suppose you do. ls it delicious? Was that a meatball you just ate? Aksel, aren't you a Muslim? Yes. ls that a good meatball? lt's got pork in. No way. - lt has. Hasn't it? Yes. Why did you put pork into the meatballs? l always do. So l've been eating pork? Yes. Stop it, Aksel. lt's disgusting. l'm a Muslim. Pigs are unclean. Filthy animals. - Aksel, stop it. Aksel! - My name's not Aksel. lt's Achmed. You'll want us to wear scarves? - Yes, as a matter of fact. Filthy animal! Achmed, have you obeyed Allah's commands today? Have you prayed a hundred times to Mecca? Are you ready to fight the Danish infidels? Shut up! l'll bash you! Annika! Annika! Aksel! lt's Annika! We can't leave him outside in this. He's not coming in here. - lt'll kill him. lf the thunder kills him it'll be the will of Allah. You are a real jerk of a Muslim. Fatima? Where are you going? Where are you going? - Nowhere. Nowhere? There, there, Kristoffer. Right, Kristoffer, don't be scared. We'll find you somewhere dry. Don't be scared. l'll find somewhere. No, no, no, Kristoffer! There, there ... l can't find my inhaler! What on earth! - l'm sorry, l'm sorry. Damn it! Annika dragged a dog in. - A dog? There are dog hairs everywhere. Annika, what are you doing? - What were you thinking of? Beat it! Get it out of here. Kristoffer! - Annika! Kristoffer! - Annika! Do you want a lift? - No, l'll walk. See you, Aksel. Have a nice day. Achmed! - See you, Aksel. Achmed! - Aksel! Aksel! Achmed! - Kristoffer's in the basement. l'm going to the club. Just one last time, Aksel ... Achmed. We're not having a dog in our flat. This is the last straw. lt was in the basement. Did you put him there? - No ... Yes. Come on out, you brats. l know you're there. l know you are. Come on out. Damn it! A dog's do! Damned brats! When l catch you you're for it. What's the time? - 5 past 1 2. What are you doing? - What do you think? Washing. Shh! Not a sound! ls there something wrong with the toilet? No. Pooh! Has somebody crapped somewhere? No. l farted. What's that? Shall l help with the supper? No ... Aksel! What's that? - My tummy, that's all. Sure. - You're weird. Out of the way. A dog! - Muslims can have dogs. Outside, really. - He's lovely! Clean up that dog's do. Get on with it! Where is it? - l don't know. Get on with it. Like an angel without wings Like a ring without a finger Like a boat without oars Like crying without tears l miss you You ... you ... l miss you ... you ... You! Life without love Turn faster. Life without love ... ls a lonely life A lousy life No, it's no good. l won't do it without Fatima. l'm afraid l can't stop your friend from being grounded just like that. Why not? Hello ... Just a moment, please. lt's up to her dad and mum. Not me. Right ... right. Testing. Testing. Right. Whoops! l think it's working now. Good afternoon! Welcome to the club song contest. We've had a good week. We've helped one another. We've made room for one another to achieve the best results. Not everyone can win, l'm afraid.

Can l try by myself? - You asked me to teach you. l want to be alone with Allah. OK. Mecca's that way. And take your shoes off. You going to do it or what? - Yes. Hi ... What's going on? - Mum, what's wrong with Aksel? Hi, Aksel. Look at Aksel. He wants to learn how to pray but he can't. Right. There's still ... whoops! l'll raise the mike ... - No, she isn't here. We're going to change the order. Now for the last song but one, ''The One and Only''. Ali, weren't you going to pray with Aksel? He's weird. - Can you give Mustafa a hand? 3, 4, 5 ... ls he doing it right? - Yes, but he has to find seven. You have to find seven. - Have you found them all? No. 1 , 2 ... 3, 4, 5, 6 ... You did it! - 8 ... Beat it! lt's Aksel. - Mum, look, there's one. l'm trying to help you. Look, Mum! Fire! Fire! - Oh, goodbye, Aksel. Goodbye. How come he came out of the bedroom? Like l said.

Without you life's no game Life without love ls a lonely life A lousy life Without a trace of spice That song was written by my brother for Aksel's sister, Mia. A really good Muslim. This is really exciting. lt was almost a dead heat - - between first and second place. But second place went to ... Hello, Aksel! l'd like to ask Annika, Fatima and Aksel to come on stage. You came second. Let's hear it for them! Aksel, what's going on? Hi, Aksel! - Yes, let's hear it for them! And first place goes to the Hip Hop Boys. Well done! - Same to you! We should have won. - lt was because l wasn't there. lf Kristoffer had been there we'd have won. Do you realize that Kristoffer is actually a bitch? A pity Aksel wasn't in it.
