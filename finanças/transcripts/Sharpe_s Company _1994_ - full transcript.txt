Dear God Cut it off! His arm - cut it off! Is he dead? - Are you drunk, Mr. Price? - I am, I am. - Is he dead, the Colonel? - Not dead yet. He has hope. Hey! You two. Get him back. Back! We're in! Do you hear? They cheer! Cuidad Rodrigo is taken Oh. He looks dead to me. Did you slice off his arm? Thought you did. Thought I saw. Sharpe. You live. Aye. No thanks to the engineers. It was men climbing men took us over those walls. I warn you, we'll do no better before the fortress at Badajoz. Colonel Lawford lost an arm, sir. He may well have the best of it, one arm or not. - He's out of it - That he is. And with him, any hope I had of promotion. Oh, come now, Sharpe. We can always find use for one such as you. And what am I? With Lawford gone, a captain on sufferance. That's all I am. I have an army acts beastly first opportunity given it. Looting raping and drunk But they were sore tried and promised plunder. God may damn them but I'm not inclined. Badajoz will punish them. Badajoz next Regarding which, my lord, the only trenching tools I have don't break are taken from the French Is it not shameful the French have better tools than us? I am not able to do what military engineering should do - get men to the breach whole, entire and with a breath left to storm it How do you wonder they get so killed? I do not, Colonel Fletcher. You see Picton? My gallopers call him the Bear-and-Ragged-Staff. Lawford's out of it lost an arm I need a new commander for the South Essex, General Picton. Have you a candidate in your Ragged Staff? Am I different? In what way? I've had a baby. A baby? A daughter. - Mine? - Ours. Are you angry? No. Why should I be? Soldiers do not need children. What... What do we call her? Antonia. Antonia. My mother's name. Antonia. - Well, where is she? - In Badajoz. In the city? I'm sorry, she was ill. Then we must fetch her out. But she's a baby still. Badajoz is the only place I have... family. Teresa, we must fetch her out. Once we lay siege, no-one gets out. Oh, yes. You are different. He's got a baba, has Sharpe. - Hasn't he, Sergeant? - He has. In Badajoz. Ha-ha! What a place to be! - We'll soon get her out of there. - Hey. Ticket to fall out, sir? I've just clapped eyes on my supper. Caught without a ticket to leave the column... is hanged maybe There you go. When will I give you your ticket, Teresa? All men should have daughters. It puts honey on their tongues. Hey... se?or? Quanto the money... to nailee the flappy solee my bootee? Eh? Eu nao entendo que vos me dizeis. Don't know now he does it Gets his tongue round it. Bats the chat like he's Portuguese hisself. For what crime were you flogged? Who are you? Who are you, damn you? I'll have you flogged again for you've not learned a lesson, it seems. Eh? Aye. I command the Light Company. You? I regret. I am Matthews, sir, with a draft come from Lisbon. William, Ensign the South Essex. Sharpe. Richard. Captain the 95th. I command the Light Company of the South Essex, for the time... being. I do beg your pardon, sir. You saw my back, Matthews. I was flogged for something I never did. You will often be blamed for something you might not have done. But being an officer... you'll never be flogged. Even for something you will do. I'm Harry Price. I was just sick. It's the drink, do you see? How do you do? And are you in funds? Matter of a few guineas - Five? - Don't. - Should I not? - He'll give you his note Promise to pay you on a scrap of paper and hope you're shot dead at Badajoz. - Oh. - What a thing to say, Richard. True though, isn't it, you rogue? Where are they, then, William? The draft Lost 'em already, have you? - March 'em in sir We need 'em - I will, I will! Detachment... halt! Right... face! Sergeant Hakeswill. Permission to speak, sir? I've nothing to say, sir. Oh, my word, what a surprise. Sharpie. Not dead yet? Captain Morris? Major Morris, sir. 'Ale and 'earty in Dublin, sir. And you are come to me. Ever such a long way, sir. I was despairing. Left face! Quick march! You lay a finger on any of my men, Sergeant, and I'll bloody kill you. Front rank, one pace forward. March! Order... arms! Draw ramrods! Mr. Matthews... get that wretch out of my sight. No. I'll do it. - Sergeant Hakeswill! - Sir! You may fall out. Thank you, sir. Damn him. Damn him. Take his name, Mr. Matthews. - Name? - Black, sir. Now... open your legs ever so wide and lie still as a dead 'un. That's it. Your mother was a pox-ridden sow who sold herself to a toad. Mother... Mr. Sharpe, sir! Miss Teresa, ma'am. He thought he might enjoy me. Permission given to carry on and murder him, sir? Up. Get up! Officers' meat, is she, sir? Portuguese whore? Tenho rendimentos. How much, sen-whora? Shut your gob and listen. Three rules. Do you hear me, Sergeant? - Sir! - Sharpe's rules. By which I regulate the Light Company. First: Fight well, fight hard. Second: Don't get drunk unless I tell you. Third: Steal nothing but from the enemy or when starving. Now... stand up straight. Arms down where they should be. Atten... shun! Ooh. You see, you don't move when an officer's talking to you. You should know that. Unless you want to hit me, Obadiah. - Obadiah? - Dead, if you strike an officer, Obadiah. Dead. Oh... but he can't die. See his neck? They tried to hang him once and it didn't kill him. - I can kill him - Every battle some try. See how he stands to attention? Never disobeys an officer, do you, Obadiah? Why, they love him. I would kill him here and now without a thought, but in front of his victims where it is seen to be done, for it is a duty. For he is evil, is Obadiah. Get out. Out. OUT! And you're a filthy Irishman as ever I did see. Harper! Leave him! Atten... shun! Get up! Get off him. Mr. Sharpe? Sir. Do you know my wife? I do not, sir. She knows you. Attend my quarters at half past twelve. I will, sir. Ride with any hounds, do you, Sharpe, at home? Which? None. Oh. Obadiah and a blackguardly officer called Morris once beat near to death a native Indian for sport, till I stopped 'em. They blamed me for it and I was flogged. Watch him, Pat. He preys on the men. He'll snaffle kit. Belts, frogs, haversacks. All entered up found lost by Obadiah, which leads to floggings, unless he gets paid. Then wives... He beats men till their wives come to him... which I call rape. I've seen his like before. An evil man marching in a cloud of pipe clay. And because he kicks up salutes, obeys every officer, he's bomb-proof to all but us, who's come up from the ranks, who are smart to him. We are that. You have duties? Then I shall see her safe, near as I may go to the enemy. So she spies for you now, does she? Are you another one of Wellington's exploring officers? I know who you are. In Badajoz? I have no fears for her. For you. Shall we marry, do you think? I shall ask your daughter what's her opinion. Oh, do ask her. Do ask my daughter. Fetch her out before we lay siege, mind, Teresa. Antonia. Antonia. Antonia! He don't hunt, Jack. Don't suppose he does, up from rank and file. How would he? Lawford gave him out to be a good officer. And Lawford's not a fool. Shall you have a private inspection of the regiment at four, sir? I shall. Ye may troop me and the colors so they know who now commands them and what they fight for. Can't keep Sharpe a captain, Jack, not now Rymer has arrived. He was fighting with his sergeants! Oh, he does, sir. Wellington dotes on him, though. Ah. Well, I dote on Wellington. There's some who don't. Not me. Ha-ha, no. Not after Talavera. Wellington will throw men at walls, sir. Let the French so much as think a wall and he pelts it with regiments as if no other way. - You sway, sir. - Invariably, sir. Try and stay more... upright. Occurs to me, do you see, sir, that I... catch the wind more than most. On account of my willowiness, sir. Mr. Sharpe is here, sir. Ask him to come in, Price. What do you want to do about Price, sir? - I'm Acting Adjutant. - Shall you want him as Adjutant? Oh, no. Oh. I ain't any longer. You're to go in, Richard. Ah. Sharpe, sit down. Do you see my wife? She has my utmost admiration... and deepest affection ever. She's took with you. Wrote me so. Price. - Drinker? - Not a drop, sir, in battle. Isn't she, Jack, took with him? Jessica. I tell him she is and he's modest enough to be flummoxed. The French Eagle you captured, Sharpe. Got about at home. Reports in the newspapers and journals. Great credit to the regiment and you Sir. But what to do with ye, though? What to do? I'm lucky with officers, but I have too many captains. Your captaincy's been refused and you've been purchased over for your company So, Sharpe, It's back to Lieutenant ye are Now, what did I see this morning? - An argument, sir. - What about? Insult to a woman, sir. Who was the woman? My wife. Does the lady march with us? Rarely. She's otherwise employed, sir. She's not on the strength. - How employed? - She kills the French, sir. I have a daughter eight months old she goes to bring from Badajoz. How does she kill French, Sharpe? She is called La Aguja. The Needle. She's a partisan. - She slits throats - Good God! Did you seek permission to marry? Good G... Rain, Jack. Get someone to get the blankets in. Good God. Sit down, Sharpe. What to do with me, sir? I have yet to meet an officer who's come up by dint of... whatever from the rank and file of the army who can find it possible to... fit, as it were. That is, be one of us. Who fits. Ye could go. There are commissions going in the Portuguese and Spanish armies There's the new Staff Corps. I'll stay, sir. Good. I will ask to command the Forlorn Hope, sir, when we storm Badajoz. Certain death? Certain promotion, sir. It's the only way for me. I see that it may be. My compliments to your wife. I shall find work for you. - What are you doing here, then? - We're off up to t'parallel trenches to dig, sir. Me and Perkins the youth, and private soldier Clayton here. We shall be requiring them shovels. And where's Sergeant Harper? Oh, there's only us, sir. And him. Who? Dekko... yonder. Come here, Sergeant. Who, sir? Me, sir? Yes, sir. What does a Chosen Man do with shovels, Hakeswill? Chosen Man, sir? What do you think this is? Bless me, Lieutenant, sir! He's a soldier, not a laborer. Chosen Men do not do duty except under arms. Well, I never, Lieutenant, sir! You waste men. It's your pleasure. Where's your rifle, Hagman? - She's been taken from me, sir. - We're getting muskets, sir. - Orders. - Who gave such an order? Captain Rymer, sir. Gentleman who commands the Light Company, which you don't. - Eh? - Sir. And they're going to look smart, in red coats and pipeclay, sir. What? Lose their green jackets? Sir. Look just as smart as the rest of us. Button your coat, Hagman. Catch cold else Jaldi! You puggled old bugger! Here comes Nosey! That's him, sir. Captain Rymer. He hunts. Standing by. All adjacent and to attention, sir! I can see you, Private Clayton! I thought you was off - fighting the French this morning - Oh, my word, Sal! You look after him, Mr. Sharpe. I want him kept whole. Go on, Sal. Plenty more where he came from. Be gone! Major Nairn. I shouldn't ask you for I have no friendship with you, but speak to Wellington for me. He gave me a leg up. He didn't make me a quartermaster. He can't now let me slide into wives and lists, rations and lists, pounds of straw, pounds of hay, spades, picks, palliasses, lists! Now, that s eloquent. And as for friendship... do please assume it. Get me command of the Forlorn Hope, sir. Only the General of the Storming Division can give that, and he will not. He will want his own first at the breach. Though why death is so sought-after, I am at a loss. Some actually recommend their offspring to it. Death is not always certain, sir, whilst promotion is. I want a rank that can't be taken from me. If I am made up to captain for being first over the wall into Badajoz... it stays. Hm. For me, I must get up along of he or there won't be none of it. Will you give me a leg up? Or have you had mud and humility enough? I cannot be more degraded, sir. They destroy my company. - It's not your company, Sharpe. Find other... - I'm a soldier, sir, not a bloody clerk. I fetch, I forage, I count shovels and I take punishment drills. It's "Yes, sir. No, sir. Can I dig your latrine, sir?" And it's not bloody soldiering. It is bloody soldiering! What the hell do you think soldiering is? Just because you swan about like a damn pirate! Listen, sir. When they fling us up against those walls, you'll be glad there's some pirates in there and not just bloody clerks. But how to get there, Mr. Sharpe? Lists. And how to be noted ye were there? Lists. And what do they send home but lists of dead, dying, sick, honored and gazetted, Captain? Richard, your woman is inside those walls... and your child. Will you die without you see your daughter live? And what is Teresa doing there? She didn't come out and now she can't. You have word of her. Of course you do. You wouldn't let her out. She's spying for you and Wellington. Is she? Then better not shout it. As to the Forlorn... I'll speak to Wellington. He'll say no and he'll see to it none says yes. He values you too much, Sharpe. He'll kill you when it suits him to some good purpose. Colonel Fletcher, can we breach it with the guns we have? Pound away at them enough, my lord, there'll be some give. There's a glacis, a ditch some 20ft deep, ravelins of fake walls and above them the real walls Very high. But we'll sight your guns for you, my lord. You may pound away. Pound away Pound away as you think fit I rate them... formidable. An order from Lord Wellington to the effect that you will not purchase bread within two leagues without a passport signed by your company officer and countersigned by me. For it is known, too often, that you go up ahead and buy off all the bread. So, caught with it, you will receive no rations, nor will you plunder gardens on forfeit of being thrown off the lines. Madam who are you? SHARPE: Mrs. Clayton, sir. - Is this a place to do that, madam? I beg your pardon, sir, but when he's hungry he's hungry, and he needs feeding. In which, I beg your pardon, he's just like his father! Yes, I'm sure. Thank you, Mr. Sharpe. Sir. - He's beautiful dressed, ain't he? - What's he want to parade us for? To make sure you don't buy up the bread before the Commissary gets it. When you want a ticket, come and see me. And keep out of them gardens. - I shan't take no notice. - Look, he worries about you. Make sure your old man's not knocking you about Not he. He's looking at Sally feeding with her teats more like. And you! Hoping to look at you, Lil. You shall not see. Never forgive myself, what with you a father an' all. - It's disgraceful! But give me your dirty shirts - I does 'em What with your lady shut up with the French an' all. I suppose she stitches beautiful. I had to do with a French officer once. I didn't want to! That was your fault. - We was left to fend after Talavera. Me? Well, it weren't mine. We was lucky not to be sent back half-naked like them dirty Spanish did with the French wives they took. - They didn't want us. Nor our clothes! - That's as may be. Oh but don't tell Clayton Mr. Sharpe He'd expire before a shot went off if he knew! Clayton. Whiten my crossbelt for parade. You leave him be, Obadiah. I seen your wife's tits, Clayton. I means to lay my hands on them teats, make no bones but I will. Be warned. When Obadiah's up, he's up like an animal! Squad... shun! Why are these men here? They are dressed differently... - Are they not of the South Essex? - Spot the man not proper dressed... a mile off sir Belts is an instance with the green man You may have him flogged for being without a belt sir Front of the enemy. Perkins! Step out the file! Very brisk. Step in the file. Good lad. I has my eyes on you. What a pity, sir. So good a lad as to muck it in such a uniform, when he ought to be spanking in red, sir. - Take post, Sergeant. - I will, sir. And you shall be proud of us, sir. Ensign take post You do that to one of my boys again, Obadiah, and I'll stick that sharp thing you're carrying up your arse until it picks your nose. Be quick, Paddy, for you is next. Hey. What are you doing? Beggins pardon, sir. I was just playing. Well, come and do something useful. See if I've added up these sums correctly. - You've had schooling, haven't you? - Yes, sir. Here. Keep you and Sal warm. Well... come to have a look at it, sir? - Badajoz. Lord... They're big, eh? Hmm. What are we gonna do? Go up 'em. What of Obadiah? Ho! Just like you said. Never puts a foot wrong. Captain Rymer is very taken with him. Tried to crime Perkins for a lost belt. Wicked set on forcing Sally Clayton. But I'll sort him. Here. St Patrick's Day God save Ireland. You're a grand man. For an Englishman. They'll be warm come the night. Did you ever marry, Patrick? Did you ever have a daughter? I swear it has me smiling if I don't catch myself. Why did Teresa not come out? She's in there, in one of those houses. Everything I love in the world and I cannot tell you which. Damn Nairn! This is his doing. Dig! If you don't dig, you don't eat! Officer coming, sar'nt. He ain't an officer. I know Mr. Lieutenant Sharpe. Me an' Sharpie's like that. And that is me on top. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Party... Party... shun! Come to show these lazy bastards how it's done, sir? Carry on, Sergeant. What, still alive, Sergeant? I do declare you're indestructible. Indestructible! Indestructible! Indestructible! The next... The next man... Indestructible! Indestructible! Hakeswill shouldn't have that pike. It's battalion company frippery. Should he not? But he's of great use to me. Aye? Well, Sergeant Harper would be more. Yes, but Sergeant Hakeswill is senior to him. Yeah. As you are to me... by a long purse. I'll see your pay stopped for this you miserable miscreants. - They hate digging. - Wouldn't you? I have never dug. Look, sir... these men are taught to fight in twos. To slip and run and one shot kills. They're Riflemen. I am told you may only manage two shots a minute with your rifles. Aye. At a pinch, three. Whatever. Each shot well-aimed is a Frenchman dead. I'm sure you're right. They do hate digging. Sharpe, it is true I bought command of your company, and between us... - Do you have weapons? - No. Well, they were ordered piled. Left. It's easier to dig. What is it? The French. Coming to fill in what you've just dug out. We can't fight 'em. Back, back - Why do you laugh? - Eh? Eh? All that bloody digging and they're filling it in. And us... us Riflemen, we ain't got a shot between us to stop 'em! - Should we not do something? - What? What? Oh, if in doubt, call the muster! Oh, bugger me! Any missing? Eh? - Any missing? - Keep the spades - Do not let them carry off the spades! Keep the spades! Right. Let's go and get them spades. They're all signed for, you know. They're all on a list. I know. Right. COME ON! We bloody showed 'em, eh? What price bloody shovels now, eh? - Run, you buggers! Run! - Good, eh? Sharpe... Yeah. We showed 'em. I'll call you sir. I'll call you sir. God damn it. Sir! You're required with the baggage. - Who requires me? - The Colonel. Who is this Baggage wants to see Mr. Sharpe? - Richard, I would ask you... - What? Oh, it is this. Will you take me with you if you get command of the Forlorn Hope? - No. - Oh, do, Richard, sir! It would make my name! William... the Forlorn Hope are dead men the hour their names are called. First up the wall of the breach, first to die, blown apart by mine or cannon. That's why it is called Forlorn. But it is glorious, is it not? And of use. Some don't die. If it is not of use, then why is it done? Somebody has to be first. Officers' baggage has been rifled with, Sharpe. - What have you lost, Jack? - It seems only silver taken. What gold he could find, jewelery. Lieutenant Price has lost earrings, he says. I don't wear them myself, sir. A present for my mother. Came across them in Ciudad Rodrigo. You have the baggage guard, Sharpe. Where the devil were you? - Get your valise. - Oh, surely not, sir. Oh, good heavens no, man! You're an officer. Find what you have missing. Damn! It's gone. My watch. And my looking glass. Got a silver lid you see Been in the family for years. My telescope. It was given me by Lord Wellington. Give ye? Give ye? Anything special about it? Any way you'd recognize it at all? A brass plate screwed to it. That's all. Inscribed: "In gratitude, AW. September 23rd." Give ye? Yes, good. Good. There you have it. Who knew you had it? I suppose... Yes, there you do have it, young man. What do you say Jack? There'll be nothing found. Sorry about your telescope. You are? Obliged to you. Ooh! Like the stench of a barracoon! Sir. Oh, damn, Harper. Oh, you shall be flogged raw for this. As soon as I may order it by court martial. Where, you scum, did you toss the portrait of my wife? Done, Sharpie. You bastard. I'm in love with your wife, Clayton. The little whore. You shall not have her. Nor is she a whore! I shan't wait for you to die in Badajoz. I shall beat you every day until she comes running on her little plump knees - begging me to have her. - Ah! You do want me to be happy, don't you, Mother? I never thought to see your tunic turned. - Colonel Windham loves his wife. - So he should. But I couldn't tell him where it was, cos I didn't have it. Patrick, I swore you did not. Thank you for the character you gave me, sir. - It's a disgrace you're to be flogged. - Indeed an' it is. Every time a man is flogged it's a disgrace. But the worst of it is I'm stripped of my rank. I'd grown kind of used to it. I'll get it back. Be alongside you. If you get the Forlorn Hope, will you ask for me? Don't be a bloody fool. You want to live, don't you? Will you ask? They don't listen to me any more. But surely you won't go up them great walls without me? If I get it... you'll come. Hakeswill did the thieving. I know. How many lashes did you get? 200. Sure, that's nothing. The cross-eyed thief who stole the officer's plate at Maidstone got 800. All at once. Walked away. Must have straightened his sight a bit, though, cos he walked plumb dumb into a cannonball at Vimiera. Well, I'll walk away. Sure, you don't feel a thing after 25. Oh, but you do, Patrick. - I did. - No. No, you don't. Ninety-three... Ninety-four. Ninety-five... Ninety-six. Ninety-seven Ninety-eight Ninety-nine One hundred One hundred and all's done sir Harper, come back here. Sir? You're a brave man. I salute you as such. Thank you, sir. Thank you. - You all right? - Jeez, it hurts like hell! I couldn't have taken much more. Told you. Dismiss 'em Sergeant Major. I lost them, Jack. Did I get them back? - I think so, sir. - Doesn't take to lose them, Jack. But what could I do - the man a thief? Sir. What is that they do with the rat-a-tat-tat? The Riflemen's signal of warning. To tell the French voltigeurs to get out the way when Wellington's around. - Don't get hurt then. - Well, might I purchase into the Rifles? - You might. Have you the money? - Oh, I have, I have. My family have. We're very rich. I'm a viscount, really. That's the thing, do you see? Then do so, William. When you're grown-up. She'll never come out now. A lot of good men are going to die. One captain will be enough. Absolutely, Sharpe. I don't want promoting. You do and they know it. Hate to have you breathing down my neck Drive me to drink. Were I not a sot already. No, Richard, do see them. They know you wait. Harry... it's all I have. Hope of promotion, and there's nothing else will drag me up. To you and your kind it is given at birth For the sake of my daughter, I must gain rank so that she may be well placed. The Forlorn Hope is a chance... and I will take it. Though by taking it, I may die before I ever see her face. For now the guns shall fire until they burst. The touchholes melt, they're so hot. And Badajoz is as tight as Rymer's arse. - Eight o'clock on the dot. - I'm grateful. Grateful to him that he comes, Nairn. Do you see what it was saved my life? Drove an inch into my groin and I would be dead. Good morning, Colonel Fletcher. I'm grateful you come, my lord. Damned if I could come to you. The French have built a dam. They have filled in the arches of the bridge and stopped the water from draining away We slop about in it as the consequence We plan to blow it up to form a vent for the pent-up water. How is your wound, Colonel Fletcher? You were saving spades, I hear. I must, for I have none. The French were offered a silver dollar for every spade they brought back, I am told. Is that where you got yours? It was in my pocket... my lord. The bullet hit it. I would be dead. I really must put this up, my lord. I'm... very tired. I shall come each morning at eight o'clock, Colonel Fletcher. I am grateful, my lord. Oh, no, my lord! I... I would not sell anything to the enemy. Oh, no! Oh, no! Shoulder... arms! Right face! Forward... march! Are you fit for duty after punishment? Given to think so by the surgeon, sir. Very well. Good. Good. And what do you have there? Seven barrels. Fires pistol balls. Mr. Nock of London. Dead handy weapon for picket duty, sir. Dead against regulations, sir. Shouldn't have it, sir. Officer's weapon, sir. Given to me by Mr. Sharpe, sir. Name took for punishment, sir? What? No, no, good God man, no. Give it me, Private Harper. Shouldn't I have it sir? What? Er... yes. Well... you won't need it, Harper. Thanks, Paddy. Why do we have all these? They're given to us instead of what we need. Three cartloads of 'em. May we not exchange them for something else? Who'd swap a load of canteens for something useful? Oh, it is a poser, sir. - Weren't you given guard of the lines? - Yes, sir. Then guard them, damn it. You're all that's between us and the French. - Oh, is that so, sir? - No, it isn't, thank God. You're given guard and I'm not given anything. Can't command a picket when the whole battalion provides pickets. Is that what we do, Richard? Can you tell me what we do, sir? For I am all at sea, all at sea Always know, William. How you find out is your own affair. But always know But nobody will tell me. They ain't got the patience, they tell me to tell me Then I have. Little else to do. Our duty is... to provide picket guard through the night. Outlying patrols and sentries. Prevent 'em surprising us Though they hardly would. You'd better get back to that post you've deserted. Oh, no, no. How will I learn? Is it dangerous? Every duty is dangerous, William. As you will find out. Not often you watch pickets go out, sir. The South Essex provides the pickets for the whole army tonight. They do. It's our turn come round. Why do you concern yourself? Soon as it's dark, the engineers will send out a bomb party. Blow up a dam get rid of the water we wade in. Over there, there will be a lot of noise. Matthews, sir. Young Matthews of ours, sir. Clear off, William. He shouldn't be here, but he means no harm. What do you do here? You must not blame me, Sharpe. Teresa is her own command, She will come out of Badajoz when she wishes. You have someone coming out in the confusion? Who is it? Clear off, William. I assure you, Sharpe... Would you tell me if you had? Oh, damn you. All of you intelligencers and your spying tricks... Sergeant, have these men form the left flank. Sergeant, have these men join the pickets on the right flank at regular intervals. Sharpe! What are you doing? - Who goes there? - Sharpe. Outlying pickets. - Where's Harper? - He's up on the left, sir. Stay down, sir. - Patrick. - There's French on the prowl. Voltigeurs. Harris is with me, Cooper's on his own, Perkins and Hagman are in the rear. - We're the furthest picket up, sir. - Harris. I can hear you, sir. Best say no more. There's a Frenchy or three hopping about a bit. Quiet, sir, or they'll hear us. Major Nairn has one of his spies coming out. He wouldn't tell you, but he has. Where's Rymer? He should be here. Flares. Les anglais! Fire! What are they doing? Idiots! It's the sappers blowing the dam. Now she'll come. Bloody idiot, Cooper! You've shot her! Teresa! Go back, Mr. Matthews! Damn. He shot ye. He shot ye! He shot ye! William. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Is this what it was all about? Found on a dead Frenchman Teresa writes to you. You may read it And on your honor swear that you'll tell me if it contains anything I should know. Sharpe You're bleeding I take your daughter in my arms every morning... to watch for you coming, and will say when you come, as you will come, "See, Antonia, there runs your father, in a green jacket with a big sword. He fights for his Wellington and us." You may be assured I shall fight to protect what honor I am left, and my child, against Frenchmen, and against Englishmen if necessary. You must not fear for me... but hurry to be with me. And live, Richard. Live." Still alive, Mr. Sharpe? Surgeon just took a bullet out of my leg. Oh, dear. Thought you was limping. Here. Souvenir. Pistol bullet. Or else he might have had my leg, Sal. Ah, sit down, Sharpe. Do you know Major Nairn, Wellington's staff? Of course you do. He's asked for you. Yes, sir. He's Staff Corps. An engineer, Sharpe. They needed help last night Not your fault I lose an officer and you get a ball in your leg. Walk, can you? Not your fault. I've just said so. Just so. Good luck. Should ye not accept my hand, sir? How is it offered, sir? You want rid of me, yet you offer your hand. How is that? I offer it for there is nothing between us. I admire your spirit. Tell him, Jack. It is impossible for Captain Rymer. He cannot get hold of his company, Which you will surely allow he commands, with you still here. Not your fault Sharpe. Not it. Not it. There'll be captaincies by the bucket come the storming They can't bear the way you look at them. I have not one captain is not conscious you hope him dead the next shot comes bouncing from Badajoz. And not one either will blame you. Not your fault. Not your fault at all. Will you take it? Oh, fairly meant. I would offer you mine also. He took that like a gentleman. Salt of the earth, good sergeants... but bless me if I can get used to them promoted. Eh? What's to happen is, you will become proper soldiers. And draw tunics of the red bright light company the South Essex, and you will hand in your precious rifle guns and draw proper muskets to go along with being proper dressed. Fit for soldiers at last! Never thought you'd see it, did you, Mother? You hate me, don't you? Well, I hate you. I do, I do, I do. I hates 'em! Who said that? I heard that. Mad? Oh, no, I ain't mad. Not so's I don't know. Now, come hup smartly to attention when I orders you. Company... 'ten... shun! Eyes in the back of my 'ead, sir, I do believe, sir. Is that where they are? They swivel so. Stand the men at their ease, Sergeant. Company, stand at... ease! - That rifle's loaded and rammed, Sergeant. - Sir? Did you know, Sergeant? Me, sir? No, sir, never, sir. - This yours, Sergeant? - No, sir. Not me, sir. Him, sir. Private 'Arper, sir. Well, how many more are loaded? - Harris. - Sir. - Cooper. - Sir. Hagman. Perkins. Sir. They say you can't be killed, Sergeant Hakeswill. It is known. "Come with me, my lads, for I cannot die. I'm going to live for ever, for they tried to hang me once but did... not... do it." I could almost believe it. Except in the case of someone you tried to kill, Sergeant Hakeswill... ...and did... not... do it. I wonder who that might be, Sergeant. You're a dead man, Obadiah. Bang! Harper. I promise you that you'll get your jackets back... ...your rifles back... ...and me back. I'll be back. Is the breach practicable? - Yes, sir. - My Lord, I doubt his competency - to pronounce upon a breach. - He's been there. You have, Sharpe, haven't you? He lay there all last night on the glacis. Yes. It's too soon. Tomorrow, we assault Badajoz. You have a day. Sir. Sharpe? I would like to be given command of the Forlorn Hope, sir. I think you're a rogue, Sharpe. But you're on my side, you're one of my rogues. I don't want you dead. May I offer my reasons, sir? They are pressing. I have a... I have a wife in the city. And a child I want to be first in and by their side... for you will sack the city, sir. You may not be given the Forlorn Hope. I shall not countenance it. No. Your attention... to events pursuant of the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo. Inhabitants of that town were offered every kind... of insult and injury. There will be no repetition... of that behavior in Badajoz. Any attacks on civilian property will be swiftly and condignly punished by death. The apprehended perpetrators being hanged at their place of crime. On the spot of your foul crime, does you do any. And I knows you will. I sees you, Clayton. I shall have you strung up where you stand for the unconscionable blackguards and common rogues the which I knows you to be. - Me? Why me? - Shut it, Clayton. Forward... march! Company... dismissed! Company... dismissed! Don't thieve, don't kill the local populace, and do not let your base desires come out of your breeches or you will swing. I count you as a friend. Kind of you, Richard. I hope I am. Sergeant Harper. Theresa is in Badajoz, as you know. I may die. Protect her if you can and I can't Oh, I shall, Richard. That you can trust me. And I promise... not a drop more than need get me up the ladder And you can rely on me and all the Rifles. She's in a house by the cathedral. Two orange trees, she writes me. That is all I can tell you to find her. She drew me a map, but... I don't have it any longer. Remember Ciudad Rodrigo? The women were cruelly treated. Some even murdered with their children. Oh, we shall have her stripped so that she shall be... naked. Obadiah has to have his scratchings, Mother. And I cannot die, for you did save me. Mother. Oh, Mother. Mother. I has to have something, Mother... ...or else I'll burst waiting for to do Sharpie's whore. He looketh on the Earth and it trembleth He toucheth the hills and they smoke I shall sing praise unto the Lord as long as I live. All sing.

Won't be long now. ...and again We'll ne'er see our foes But we wish them to stay They?ll never see us but they wish us away My hopes to you, sir And the South Essex you command Will you let my men die as Rifles? In green jackets, they will serve you just as well. They are proud men. You have need of proud men. And they will not fail you now Captain Rymer I know they will not, Sharpe. As I know you will not.
