MAN FROM THE OAK FOREST Serbia, year 1944. Chetniks, assistants of the German occupant in black business of death and destruction are expecting near defeat. They're running away from retaliatory force of people. They're flowing and diverging like blurred waters. This is a story about one of those men, from the evil side. Do you want to get beaten? Come and hit me. The teacher was hitting you, and it didn't help. Your teacher will be captured now, and then... His head will roll. - Who will capture him? - Maksim! They won't capture him! - Like your uncle wasn't captured either. Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Maksim! Run! Where are you serving at? - At Pacic the trader, in the town. Do you know how am I? - I know, Maksim from the forest. What's your name? - I'm Maksim, too. Do you know there's other people from the forest? Did you see any of them? - I didn't. They are disguised Russian, Turks, they're trembling when they see me. All their houses in the village tremble, and men and women tremble, dogs, and the cattle. 'Maksim is coming', they say. But that's not the same Maksim from the oak forest. Why don't they call me a goat son now? Maksim is a God now. - Did you capture the teacher? No, but he won't last for long. If you're something then you're worth of living. Maksim is on the headquarters meeting, Maksim has a jurisdiction. And women and girls, 'Maksim, do you want to dance?' Village whores! They don't run away anymore. Did the madam from the town passed by today? Did you hear me? - I didn't see her. - She lives at your boss' house. She does. Boss hates her. He says she's a black marketeer. She's dying for the gold. - He hates her because she's stronger. She's stronger than anyone. You don't know what she's thinking, and you have to look at her. Woman. She keeps bicycle in her room, it's all shiny. You can't see enough of it. And her... You don't know when will she greet you, and when she'll disappear. Like a wind. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Do you know where is? - Where is? Are you from around here? - I know the area, what do you want to know? Do you know where is... - What? - What? I mean... You're going the right way. Up there. - Thank you. What's here room like? It must be pretty. You went in, right? - It smells, everything smells nice in the room. I can smell her when she goes across the mountain. You think she stayed in the grass, in branches, in leaves. She disappears, she's gone for 10 days. And the smell is still there, you can't forget her. I'll buy a bicycle too, a blue one, like hers. Pacic promised me, the money that I earn, he puts away, When we collect 100 thousand! He said three years, if I serve him for three years, it'll pay off. How far can you go, bicycle? Did you see that woman that drives a bicycle around here? What are you doing here, professor? - As you can see, I have nothing to smoke. I was thinking that will that woman go around here on a bike, so I can buy. She's passing here when she goes home. - Shall we wait for her? It's no use, it's too late. She won't come anymore. You think? - You fancy the madam? You fancy her too, professor. - Surely she won't come, let's go. Professor, you and that madam... You know... - What? She likes you. - Me? Come on, Maksim. If only I could have more of this. Unfortunately, that's the last one. Golden coin? - Golden coin. So, it's gold. How some women die... for gold. And I never needed it. Stop! Give me that water! - Maksim! So what? Let him come! Wait, stop! What are you doing here? Morons! - Village pranks. What are your pranks like? White-collar? You're joking around, you have nothing else to do. - Military joke. Who ordered it? - Army need jokes. Who ordered it? Jan, I guess, how should I know? You know nothing! It's tangled. - You untangle it if you know. There. Who are you? I came by contact. Professor knows everything about me. - He's my former student. Although he learned his last lesson wrong, however it's more and more like that, this country would come out of the middle age in about 200 years. You're talking too much, professor. Who's that? Poet of death. Or in prose, a murderer. What, you got scared? Forget about Maksim. He was born alone, he's living alone, and he'll die alone. There's no hope for him. Mine, come and lie down. This professor of ours is talking too much. Duke? - What is it? I don't trust anyone! - He's educated so he talks. Now one young boy has come, he says by contact. Why are they sending that children to me? They're useless. There's no sign of the teacher. I'm poisoning people in the villages. I'm sensing he's in the mountain. - Teacher is not alone. I was dreaming just before, he made an ambush behind the bus. Germans came, they fired, they blew up the car. I replaced the valves before the war. What a bus was that! 80 km daily, that was for sure. I was the boss and a mechanic and a driver! The world was mine. I could've done whatever I wanted. - What do you want? That trader from the town, did she come today? - She didn't! If she comes tomorrow tell her to wait for me. - If she comes I'll tell her. Merchants are complaining about her. She's black marketing around the villages. She's taking their customers. They say that no one is a match for her. She appears on 10 locations during the day. I have to clear that up. There must be order in this mountain! What can you do? What do you mean? How the hell do you think I mean? Do you know something smart, specific, useful? Not just reading and speaking. For example, do you know how to fix an engine? I have thinly gymnasium physics knowledge. Gymnasium knowledge is no knowledge! Gymnasiums are making danglers and speakers! And communists! What shall I do with you? Why did you come here? To help as much as I can. In fights against occupation. - Is there something new? Well you know... there is. Of course! Get in here! Against Kraut's occupation. You to fight against it? You read a lot of books, so you think you're smart! Can't you see we're not fighting against Krauts? And that teacher and communists can fight against occupations as much as they want! If Krauts leave, he's gone forever. Are you listening to me? - I'm listening carefully. - You should. When you're weaker you have to listen, when you're stronger, you can talk. But you don't have to. As you wish. Words, that's just... like that. So stronger ones can feel nice. And you keep quiet and suffer. Go away now. Did he found out something about the teacher? Who is he? I'm telling you, he was here, I saw him with my own eyes. I was telling to the old man, but he doesn't want to. Simic's house by the mill is full of weapons. Go there tonight, if you find it... He convicted himself. - Duke! Troops are lined up. Which Simic was meeting with the teacher? Old man. I was telling him long time ago to be careful, and he sent me off. In front of people, in the inn. Just wait, I told him. You checked about the weapons? - Just put your hand in the furnace. Be careful, I'm not making these marks just to make them. Either is his head, or yours. Did I ever lie to you? Tell me. You didn't. Tell the old man that I'm sending my regards before his trip. It's done. - Look at that, a poor man always has to pee after that. Do you know, professor, what are the meanings of Maksim's marks? I know. One communist less. - Why did I come here? For what people should I be bond? People are bound by guild, by their origin. They're bound by the letters. Maksim is bonding by... - Maksim is alone. He's always running away. When he stops and turn around, others run away. Society forgives people foolishness, ignorance, selfishness, even a crime. Society can forgive everything to a man, except solitude. They don't forgive that. Professor, what are you doing? - I'm removing lice. What's the use when you don't have enough. Enough of what? - You know. Of that. Gold. You remember everything. It's nice. It's expensive. - Get that inside. You have arrived madam. - Good afternoon. I bring everything to them, and then it's expensive. I was meaning to talk to you about that. Merchants are complaining about you. Because of the competition. - What would they want? I'm breaking my legs on this mountain, and they want their money from the sky! Madam, you know that I've ordered that no one is bothering you here. Sometimes I think, what would happen if you're not here in this area where no one likes me. Stay a little more at least, spend a night here. You know I can't. - Then tomorrow night. I have to get my goods. - Alright. You see someone is making army, someone is making politics and someone is making love. And all I'm interested in is trading and money. I'm guessing,professor... - I'm guessing you didn't talk about me. And what if I did? - I'm talking about cigarettes - So do I. Just about cigarettes. I brought you two packs. Maksim! Maksim! Come here to smoke! - Professor! Good things come to those who wait. That's our political slogan. No, please. - In the name of enslaved fatherland, I thank you. Well, until we meet again. Until we meet again. It wasn't to far away last night. - It wasn't. You know each other? - Yes. How do you know this woman? - I met her last night. Last night? - Yes, when I was coming here. So it's like that. - Professor, you fell in love. Not yet, but I'm going towards that. You're enjoying in the forest. You're talking just with me like with a friend. And with villagers. Why are you getting mad? Tell me. You're always alone. - You don't have company either. I thought someone will escort you down there, to the cemetery. - Who? You smell nice. I have to go. Were you scared back there? No. No. You're a strange woman. With your beauty you could live a lot better. I live the way I can. We all live the way we have to. - Why do you need it so many? What? - Don't act stupid, I know. What? Gold. And me, I don't need it. I don't understand. Everyone needs... something. You say, you're not afraid of me. - No. Can you prove that? I can. - How? When will you prove it? When time for that comes. - When you get what you need? Then I'll prove it to you. With great pleasure! I promise you! Pacic will cheat you for the money. Your bicycle is gone. Whom he told? I found out. Your work is useless, completely. You won't get a bicycle from Pacic. I'll kill! You don't have to. You can get a bicycle like this. You're going to the fair tomorrow? - Yes, to take the cattle. - Fair on Mitrovdan again. Friday, market day. People are selling cattle, wheat, there will be plenty of money. You'll have a bicycle in a week. A new one. Like this? - Like that. It's best to do it from behind. You won't trick me? - I won't. - Do you promise? - Yes. Did you go down to the mill? - I didn't see her. How do you know I was talking about her? - We'll abandon our vices because of her. You won't do that anymore, and I won't... I won't drink. Since the duke is gone, I'm going to sleep. Listen duke, first of all, we have to chase the teacher. Can't you see he's killing people in the mountain. But I don't know... - What? I'm not sure that communists are killing. - Who does? Teacher does, that's clear. And I can't chase him with anything. Army is poor, they need clothes, shoes, food. Here, I brought a million now. People don't have the money. - They don't! They don't want to! I could've fix my bus too. To drive villagers around and collect money. Couldn't I? - You could. About that bounty... - He's lying there like a dead man. They removed the wheels, everything. Gypsies are doing that, selling old iron. - Car like that... Is at least wheel at its place? - Yes, now let's see about that bounty. People are saying, so many of you in the woods and the teacher is alone. We'll make a bounty, put it all over villages, we'll read it in front of the church and school and on the fair. And when they kill the teacher, with what money should I pay the bounty? The town is ready to pay. - How much? 300 thousand? It's too much. - 5 thousand. - 50. - Those things can't be done like that! 200 thousand and that's final. Let's write a bounty. Alright. - Stay for a while. What? - That woman who lives next to you. - Ah, trader without firm and taxes. I'll check that. Tell her to come tonight. I'll wait for her. If she doesn't come... Take this. - Alright. - A letter. - I'll give it to her. If you wanted to ask something, ask now! Can I buy golden coins down there? - Yes, but they're expensive. I don't care. - Alright then. Do you have the money? How did you get that much money? - Take it. And buy it as soon as possible. Not to ask questions and talk around. For just one word, you won't see the rest of the world. If you trick me, you know me well. I didn't thank you for untangling me, I was confused. - That's nothing. To be honest, if it weren't for you, I'd leave right away. You know, I'm sick of all this fighting against Germans, give me your hand. Someone is fighting. I'm from the village, but I know people are fighting somewhere. You know? - Yes. - What do you know? Much more than you think. Maksim! What is she saying? Nothing, what can she say? That's a woman. Doesn't telling anything. But when she looks at you, then you know. You understand. - I was up there, with the duke. Well? - I can't say in front of him. - What are you waiting for? I have something for you.1 What would you do without me? Stevan Odzakovic, the communist. I found a red rooster for you again. The duke will explain everything to you. You know Maksim, I'm serving to you. I was always with you... The duke will explain everything to you. I was there... - I know where you were, and why were you, you crow! As soon as I see you, I understand. Don't be afraid, I won't kill you, I don't want to get my hands dirty. You crow! Maksim! Maksim, the duke is calling you. Mine, fill that bottle with brandy. So I don't waste my energy completely. I'm starting to envy you because of brandy. Although you're hiding, so you don't see the truth. Brandy is just one of many possibilities. Other is the thing you intend to do, and on which I do not envy you. What do I intend to do? To change the club. - In hell among devils, just not here. And you? - In hell, under ground, among devils, just not among angels. What's that mean? You admit that the communist moral is high. That... In fact, it's the only that... - Communist moral is high, but stiff. And unnatural. If the communists are ready to fight against occupation, then I don't care about anything else. I don't care about your philosophy, I care about your action. My dear one... Action. If they could only be satisfied with action, but they're asking a person to immediately think like them. They are like ambitious lover. Body isn't enough for them. They want the soul too. - The soul too? I'm ready to listen every ideas. And I'm free to accept them or not. - Then you're reasonable. It's unbelievable how a terrible vice can be made from a simple word like reason. I don't want to listen to you anymore. You think you're right, but I won't listen. Mine, one more word. All this I said to you, that's mostly correct. But even then, I'm not right. You're right. I want to sleep now. Good night. Is that you, Maksim? - It's me. That Stevan Odzakovic... - I know. - There's no mercy for them, go right away. - Not anymore. What did you say? Do you know that the Germans will soon lose this war? And there's more and more of communists. Their houses are full of weapons! How could that crow know? He's just telling around. How could he know? - I know! You and me are here to fight against communism! If you and me won't do it, who will? Not that professor, will he? Maksim. - What is it? - I'm not for killings just for fun. Search the house, and if you find weapons or fliers, you kill Stevan. I knew it. You called me, duke? Go down towards cemetery. - Towards cemetery? Yes, sir! Wait for that madam from the town. She will come here tonight. Lead her here so no one sees her, is that clear? - Yes, sir! - Quickly now! What's your name? What is your name? - Stevan. What is this, Stevan? Communist fliers? You're giving them away to the people? What kind of hat is this? Stevan, did you hear me? I'm talking to you! - From school. You went to school because of this? Do you know what will happen to you? Do your job. Get up. Turn around. Get lost! Can you smell this scent? - I don't smell anything. Neither do I. You go now. - Why? We'll go with you. - I'll go alone. - You can't go alone. I told you to go! Don't go! I'm scared. I'm scared! - Are you scared when I'm here? - No! Where were you tonight? Tell me. If you don't tell me, I'll kill. I'll kill you easily, you know? At duke. At duke? And I thought... So it's you and him. Not me, him! Here, read this. What does it say? What does it say? He's calling me to come tonight. He's threatening. And? - I escaped. That's what happened. - Tell me please, is that true? Do you want a proof that I'm not lying? Yes. Come at my apartment, tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? - But don't say a word to anyone! I won't go to town, I can't. You can. Tomorrow at midnight. I'll be waiting. Tomorrow, when you come. Tomorrow for sure? - Yes. I'll bring you that. - What? I know what you like. You're sitting, resting. Do you know that I was hunting the teacher? What were you doing in the mountain last night? - I was on a mission. I wasn't writing letters for women. - What did you say? Get up when you're talking to me! Get up! Lead the horse. Lead the horse! Lead! Come on! Nothing can help him. Nothing. What is it? - I was waiting. - For what? - She didn't come! You fool! Move! Did you catch the teacher? The teacher was never alone. That's not important, authorities are in the city, we're in the mountain... Silence! There's a question who will go into town first! Wait, the teacher will be captured today or tomorrow, Germans are leaving, the army has to be ready to go into town when we give the signal. Listen, people, you're loosing what's the most important... Why do you care about their politics? You and me have other business. Tell me. Tell you what? A woman is resisting. She's defending herself. Tell me, Mine. For real, Maksim, I have nothing to tell you. - If you know what she needs, then it's easy. You talk to much, you read like from a book. And me, on the other side... Yellow, like the Sun. Tonight when I arrive at her place, here's the gold! And her... What gold? What do you think? Just manly, it's easy like that. I wanted to tell you. - What? I think... - You're talking about those murders in the mountain? - Not that. That is teacher for sure. But Maksim is notorious, you're going into town. It would be political that you... - To kill him before we go to town. So you know it. Don't go into town with Maksim. You'd make a huge mistake. Mine. Go. And you? Go! - And you? Leave! Go away! And it seems that all the village on the other side of the mountain are communist. Will our people take the town? - Pacic! What is it? - Come here for a bit. What do you want? That thing we talked about. About the gold. I have it. Are you sure? - Yes. - All of it? Don't worry. You better have it when I come. - Everything is alright. When I come, that can even be tonight. - Alright. She's the comrade in who's house is chetniks headquarter. Well, talk comrade! What were chetniks and their informants talked about? Well, only thing I heard is that chetniks are getting ready to go down into town. And Mine heard everything, their plan. Chetniks know that you're corps is getting close. - That's yours, ours, partisan corps. They're expecting reinforcement. - You know teacher, that last night we killed their reinforcements easily by the river. - I heard. A bunch of chetniks doesn't make any obstacle to us. But we need every man now to fight against Germans. We can't allow them to retreat without losses. And you? Are you tired from illegal work? Don't ask, I can't wait to go into normal battle with the others. There was horrible days. Last night, teacher, when they were shooting at you, I ran into that butcher. He tried to rape me. I was afraid that he'll cut you off, he was armed. How did you escape? - Forget it, I barely escaped. How did you end up with chetniks. - My professor was there, he was a decent man once. I went to see him. I just got involved. - How did you escape? She helped me. You know what? You'll go as soon it's dark. We have to arrange everything now. Sorry for the interruption, teacher, but last night I arranged a meeting with that butcher for tonight, at midnight. I think we should take advantage of that, to kill him. Wait, wait. You see, that will be very well received among people. To remove the fear of one wild beast. - I think so too, we have to kill Maksim. Maksim! Maksim! Maksim! Maksim! What is it? - I was by the mill, and then I... She said... I was running to find you. Everyone was in the mill, communists. I saw a bicycle, I wanted to touch it and it fell, then I peaked, and teacher was there, and girls, and that woman. She said... She said: 'We have to kill Maksim'. Yes, she said it like that, 'We have to kill Maksim.' To kill. Maksim, that thing about the bicycle, is it for sure? Maksim, don't go, they'll kill you! Maksim! What is it, professor? Don't you know we're in movement? Movement is for people who belong to some movement. As I don't belong to any, I promise you, I'm fine here. - I knew you are a traitor! I always knew! Where is that Mine of yours? I have no one. I'm completely alone. - I'll shot him too, him too! Traitors! If he betrayed a man, shoot him! If he betrayed ideals... - You drunk fool! He has to betray ideals, he was intellectual back then. You plan to conquer the town like that? - Well... I don't have anything better. Where's your guy? - I don't know... I... Where's your brother? - I don't know, he disappeared. What? Mice fled? Where is your army? Where is Maksim? - I don't know. - Call that two men of his. I'll find them. Stop. I didn't get the gold for you yet. That can't be done in just one day. But you're here now. I'll find something. Everything can be found. Listen, I know how you got that money. And the duke knows too. I can help you. Wait. Wait! Help! Help! The duke ordered to give us your weapon, and to come with us. He said that? - Maksim, don't! Don't, Maksim! Mine! Duke!
