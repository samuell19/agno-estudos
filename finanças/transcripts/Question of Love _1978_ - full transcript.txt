What do you want? A QUESTION OF LOVE - Hello, Captain. - My respects. I saw the body. A bullet in the head. He died instantly. Did you know him? Philippe Dumais was an architect. A rich 58-year-old married to a younger, Swedish woman. Seven months ago - you weren't here -, he fired at some gypsies who assaulted him, injuring Sylvain Maller. It could be retaliation. I'll launch a search on Sylvain and his cousin. How is Mrs. Dumais coping? She's here. We had planned to eat out. When I saw the gate open, I went outside. I hurried down, so he wouldn't have to wait. I saw them. Two of them. One came up against the side of the car. He fired his gun. I ran. FAMOUS ARCHITECT KILLED I believe your husband owned a gun. Yes. Where was it stored? I don't know. It was seized after the fight. But then he got it back. Look. The point is that I can't take that plane. I don't care if you pay me back. I might leave again in two days. Just tell me what to do. I was here. Right in this spot. Getting some air. I saw Mr. Dumais' car up the road, the headlights, and a shadow creeping up between the trees and the car. I heard a shot. I was dumbstruck. I remembered how he had been assaulted in the past. Then the man ran away, that way. - Two men. - No. Are you sure? If there were two, I'd have seen two. But I only saw one. What did he look like? Tall? Short? Rather tall. But I'm not positive. The one who fired was here. And the other... over here. Excuse me. You could be mistaken. You're in shock. No. I'm certain about it. They both ran away that way. Would you recognize them? No, I don't think so. You should rest. Your husband's office is downtown? Yes. 12 rue Manfredo. Mrs. Ventoux, my husband's secretary, will be glad to help you. - Who scheduled his meetings? - I did. He would also do it sometimes. But I knew everything. There are some things you must know. - You wish to depose? - Yes. - Formally? - Yes. No, not now. I can't. Yes. Call me back this afternoon. I'll find a way. I'd like you to look up a certain Tom Hastings. He's English. He works at the IBM centre in La Gaude. Very well. Do you know Tom Hastings? Yes. Was he your lover? Yes. Where is he? Is this part of the investigation? Absolutely. He had a plane for London today. He didn't take it. He just called me. We're meeting later today. Ask him to stop by my office. I didn't find much on Hastings. He's a computer scientist. He gave a series of lectures at the La Gaude centre. Unmarried. His name turned up in a drug case, marijuana trafficking, as a customer. The consul interceded in his defence. What did he do, yesterday? He went to the casino. He was supposed to leave for London this morning. He booked two tickets. - Are you sure? - Yes. - And the gypsies? - We're on it. They changed camps. What are you doing? I already looked for the gun. I didn't find it. It was in his car. You're wrong. It wasn't me. I saw you. - Me? - Yes. - Did you see my face? - No. So? It was the way you walked and moved. I didn't have a single doubt. Then I'm crazy! - Why not turn me in? - I'd mean turning myself in too. Why mention two attackers? I was wrong, I know. I wasn't thinking. I remembered the first case. I remembered the gypsies. I thought the police would do the same. If it wasn't for that neighbour... Philippe's gun is gone. So? What does it have to do with me? I didn't even know he had a gun. You have to see the judge. I'll contact the consulate. Last night after dinner I heard the sound of an engine racing. I live in that villa, right behind the Dumais'. I looked out the window and saw a car racing around the corner as if it had the cops on its tail. I didn't make the connection, but when I read the papers... I came to check and saw the wall was damaged. The fender must be scraped. Interesting. How many people were in the car? One or two? I don't know! What type of car was it? Grey or beige... or white. That's all I can say. I found it best to come here and help you avoid the journalists. I have a few questions on my mind. First, Mr. Hastings has yet to show himself. I saw him. He will come to see you. He's getting prepared. Did your husband know him? Yes. Mrs. Ventoux said Mr. Hastings had come to see him. Were you aware? Yes. They refused to tell me what was said. Except for one sentence. Your husband told you - according to Mrs. Ventoux who overheard it -: "He came to negotiate your leaving." Maybe. - A curious sentence. - Yes. Did Mr. Dumais know about your affair? Yes. - Did he accept it? - I was free to do as I pleased. Even to leave him? I never intended to. What do you think? That I killed him? Hundreds of little punks in Nice could have done it. Did you question them? The police found the Mallers. They weren't in Nice that day. Meanwhile you focus on my private matters. An investigation explores many leads, closing them one at a time. Sometimes, none are left at the end. "Case closed," is what we write. May I question your employee? The bell is here. You rang? Could you give us some privacy? You told the police you were with Mrs. Dumais when her husband's car arrived. What did you see? Not much. She rushed down, I turned off the lights in the den, and I heard a shot. I went to the window and saw her running. While you were waiting with her, what was Mrs. Dumais like? Nervous? Calm? Calm. Very calm. Thank you. You may come in. Forgive me for being so obnoxious. A professional quirk. Let's record your deposition. CAR DEALERSHIP Looks like cement. Roughcast, to be exact. I'm sorry to impose this on you, but it's capital. It this the car you sold before leaving? Or tried to leave, if I may. This is the car. Did you damage the fender? No. It happened that night. I'd parked by the casino. When I came out, I realized there was a scrape French drivers have no respect for other people's cars. I even showed it to a casino employee. You asked the man who bought it to lend you back the car. That's right. Why? I wanted to enjoy my last evening in France. Is that a crime? Here's what I collected. Ask for a lab analysis. Question: you'd booked a morning plane for London which you didn't board. - Why? - Personal matters. Is this "personal matter" called Catherine Dumais? No comment. No comment. You booked two seats in the plane. Why two? You attitude is dangerous, Mr. Hastings. A silence is well worth an answer. You met with Mr. Dumais. Why? I knew him. I came to say goodbye. Did you visit everyone before not leaving? That woman hates us. She's doing her job. It's a lousy job. She always suspected us. Now she wants to prove she's right. Stop. I'll bet you anything the guy in the brown vest over there will stop too. Missed. That bitch is out to get us. We didn't do anything. But that's just it. We have to leave. - And go where? - With me. To London, then the USA. I'm offered a position in a university. We can get married in London. You'll become English. They'll never hurt us then. What we have to do is stall. Things could change. They find the culprit. Another judge steps in. I'm interrupting your work. How lovely. I wish I had time to garden too. Unfortunately... "As Secretary of the Architects Association, "I was surprised last Monday to see Mr. Dumais "leave during a session. "He was usually very committed. "He said he was dining with his wife." When was this dinner decided upon? That afternoon. So Mr. Dumais had to change his plans. Yes. - At your request? - A mutual agreement. We didn't go out for our anniversary. We decided to go out that night. He could have chosen another day, given he had a meeting. You believe I ambushed my husband? It's a quirk, a professional tic of sorts. We seek logic in everything. Even the smallest events. Do you like your job? Sometimes I do, sometimes not at all. Sneaking into people's lives, hunting them down. How exhilarating. You're exaggerating, Mrs. Dumais. I find out what people have or have not done. That's it. - Did you start young? - Somewhat. I wanted to know who was lying and who told the truth. Did you always tell the truth? Not always, no! For instance, when I'd done something wrong. You've hated me from the start. I don't hate you. but some things trouble me. Like this. A bill I found in your husband's desk. On Saturday, he bought you a very expensive ring. Did he already know you planned to leave him? It was a gift he planned to buy for our anniversary. May I see this ring? Of course. It's ravishing. I have other jewels he bought for me, they're all ravishing. - Do you wish to see them? - Not now. He was a wonderful husband. Why would I want him dead? A wonderful husband indeed. But weak. Very weak. He wasn't weak. You were saying? We had a moral agreement. Catherine... the doctor told me it would be hard for me to regain... what I've lost. He's wrong, darling. It's in your head. So it's curable. It's psychosomatic. It means I'm a wreck, both body and mind. My heart has beaten for you too much. You mean I went too far. We both did. Catherine... if one day, you like someone, resist, but not too long. Don't be foolish. I've thought it through. It's the only sensible solution. It was three years ago. He saw a professor, in Paris. He didn't follow his advice. I've heard it's rare for men to be cured. Yet, I still found some pleasure with him. I can also explain how, if you wish. Could you give me this professor's name? I'll look it up. Tom is going to London. He wants me to go with him. I said no. If you want to go, go. Do you love Tom? - No. - I always figured one day a man would matter more than the rest. It's how things go. Are these "things" me? I can't live without you, Philippe. Never has any man given me as much pleasure as you have. That was centuries ago. It was yesterday. Who did you love? Tom Hastings? Your husband? Both? My husband. Don't tell me that, to you, Tom was only... May I ask you something? Are you married? No. But if you must know... I've loved two men, one after the other. These are the pieces I showed Mr. and Mrs. Dumais. The finest in my collection. But she opted for a very simple diamond. Were you surprised? Not surprised, no. I thought she would be attracted by a more sophisticated piece. But a diamond can be converted into cash more easily. Here is the bullet that killed Dumais. Here is the one that injured Sylvain Maller. I want to know if the two were fired by the same gun. Give me 48 hours. It's all I can do. Call me when you know. The judge has doubts. She wouldn't, if it was the same weapon. I hope. French law allows witnesses to remain silent if they fear being misinterpreted. Am I saying something judicially wrong? No. But silence can harm a witness, like Mr. Hastings. And Mrs. Dumais. - We... - Never mind. My silence is a feint. My words are lies. Am I right? Not exactly. But why won't you admit the 2nd plane ticket was for Mrs. Dumais? Let's say it was. What's it to you? I'm asking you the question. When you went to see Mr. Dumais, was it to tell him she was leaving? My visit is not connected to Mr. Dumais' death. You came to negotiate. Your name turned up in a drug case. Is this about a murder or drug trafficking? My questions pertain to police intelligence. I advise him not to answer on this point. This is a lecture, not an inquiry. Psychology, not an investigation. Every crime has its motive. Did Mrs. Dumais and her lover have a reason to kill Mr. Dumais or did only one of two? Shouldn't you be looking for material evidence? True, Your Excellency. Insofar as Mr. Hastings accepts to cooperate. Do you maintain your car was damaged by the casino? Yes. We analyzed the roughcast on the crumpled fender and that on the wall. Experts detected a match. Another question. - Do you own a gun? - No. A car, a gun, no psychology there. They're solid, material objects. Isn't that right? Captain Lachot and I are passionate about them, just like you. It's quite a favour you're asking. No one will know. - All right. - Thanks, man. We're devastated. You have all our sympathy. - Thank you, Angelo. - Please. - Maurice. - Yes? I double-parked. Take my car to the car park. Right away. You weren't scheduled. Oh, I understand... I understand you have other issues. If you'll just wait a moment. All right. The Attorney General asked to attend. I agreed to it. Tom Hastings was indeed seen at the casino that night, but he could have left discreetly. He indeed showed the bellman the damaged fender, but he cannot say if the car stayed put all night. No leads coming from local criminals or gypsies. The Mallers vanished but they often have reasons to do so. Finally, and this is the crucial point, it's possible Philippe Dumais was killed with his own gun. I'm waiting for the lab results. It's crystal clear, Suzanne. - Very clear. - It's even typical. An unwanted husband a young wife, a lover who satisfies her. - Is Mrs. Dumais being watched? - Yes. - And Mr. Hastings? - No. The British consul is very fussy. He complained about the press. Call our man tailing Mrs. Dumais. Tell him to bring her here, right away. Even if she doesn't talk... - The evidence we have... - "We"? - Where is Mrs. Dumais? - Here. I'll take care of her in a moment. Please, not here. You better keep still, faggot. Got it? Oh, shit! Hey. Marcel, Catherine. - Enchanté. - Hello. Here's my wife's passport. I hope it'll all be all right. Thank you. Larcher Bianca There's another one. Right. Cheer up. You're just visiting Italy with your wife. PASSPORT Park the car over here. Over here. Your ID. Open the trunk. Follow me, ma'am. You stay here. You can't! Follow me, Mr. Hastings. - I refuse. - Follow me. Let me call the consul. You'll can call anyone from there. Let's go. If this is all the evidence you have, then arrest anyone, except an Englishman, and we'll remain on good terms. Do you have anything else against Tom Hastings? We could have some new developments. In a month? A year? A century? In a few hours. You'll be sure Mr. Hastings is guilty? I could consider it. He is a British citizen. Either you indict him, or you release him immediately. Can I make a private phone call? This way. Soon we'll be in Italy. You will. I won't. I won't abandon you. We have nothing to hide. Neither of us do. I have nothing to be afraid of? I have to make a decision, now. I'd like to know your opinion. As soon as an Englishman is mixed up, it's back to Joan of Arc or Waterloo. Keep him and they'll all jump on you. For the moment, you cannot charge him or keep him in custody. It would have been different with a positive result on the weapons. But now we're stuck. What about Mrs. Dumais? Keep her. She's French and guilty. If she is, then so is Tom Hastings. He'll vanish forever. But we'll be the heroes. We acted appropriately. They can't accuse us of persecution. Mr. Larcher. No one is charged, no offense was committed. You're free to go. - Mrs. Dumais' luggage? - Yes. Bring them here. There's a call for Captain Lachot. Excuse me. Picasso 1912. You packed quality, not quantity. Gifts from my husband. Souvenirs... priceless ones. I must seize your luggage for an inventory. Ms. Corbier. Can you tell me how Mr. Dumais managed to be shot with his own gun? I didn't kill my husband. And I didn't ask anyone else to. Did Tom Hastings play any part in this? I suspected it, but not anymore. It doesn't make any sense. If he'd killed him, he'd have boarded that plane. A man like Mr. Hastings, engineer, mathematician, is easily convinced of his superiority, and his impunity. No. I can't imagine he'd do it. It's not pleasant sending someone to jail, Mrs. Dumais. But I'm forced to do it. Given the lab results and your attempted escape, no judge would do otherwise. So if you have something to say, say it now. I beg you. We'll call you as soon as your things arrive. What's your name? Catherine Dumais. I'm Gisèle Polmi. You can call me Gis. - Want a cigarette? - No, thanks. What did you do? - It seems I killed my husband. - Yeah. I read about it. You had some British lover. Where is he? Gone. I'll send your international warrant to the chancellery. England is free to keep Hastings or expel him. They're more fussy than ever. As for us, we can't send a commando. I fear we won't ever see him again. And between us... I don't care. I'll give it back. I took a few pictures to add to the case. When you investigate a criminal case, you explore a whole life story. Mr. Dumais visited Stockholm for a symposium. You were a hostess? An interpreter. He'd had a slight mishap. His luggage was lost. He was upset. The lecture he was to give was in his suitcase. I have some news. Your luggage is in Zurich. What I liked about him was his calm. He wasn't mad. He was entertained. Say, I need to find someone to dictate my report to. It's what I do. His luggage circled around Europe. London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels... They arrived on the very last day. He invited me to dinner to thank me. So, of course, you don't get along with your wife anymore? How did you guess? He wanted me to come to France. He said I was born to live under the sun. He would call me. Said he was divorcing. I didn't believe it. Catherine! I didn't bring any luggage, just this piece of paper. I'll read it to you in the plane. It's a fine document: a divorce ruling. You lived some months with him before marrying. There were issues with his ex-wife who owned half of the architect's office. You lived a quiet life. At least that's what it seemed. We called the Stockholm police. They confirm the account you gave. I'll send you the report. There's a passage I wish to read to Mrs. Dumais. "Ms. Catherine Regvist worked for a company "which provides hostesses for receptions. "It no longer exists. "It was dismantled when "it was revealed it tolerated "employee prostitution. "Ms. Regvist, however, "was never charged for such deeds." I never took part in it. Police reports are merely a bunch of gossip. They just can't get enough. You say your husband became impotent three years ago. And no one else knew about it. Philippe Dumais, impotent? He was a man, in every sense of the term. I'm an old friend. We were classmates. I'd have known. I'm Secretary of the association. I'm surprised. You usually end up knowing these things. I was married to him for eleven years. There's a lot I can say. But not that. These are just testimonies. But we may form one hypothesis: this impotence helps you explain the liberties you took. Why would Philippe accept them? Some men, impotent or not, accept such affairs. I sent at letter to Paris asking to question the professor Mr. Dumais supposedly consulted. Say, wouldn't he be the one who... "Who" what? The Brit had the hots for you. Seems like it. Like everyone else, you needed some dick from time to time. Maybe he was the one who did it. - I don't think so. - You could say so. If I were you, I'd demolish him. - I don't need to. - Really? Well... Six years ago, I drew up Mr. Dumais' will. Mrs. Dumais became his sole heir. Estimations show personal and real property amounted to one billion cents. And in case of a divorce? The Dumais had a prenuptial agreement. He didn't owe his wife anything. It depended on his sole generosity. I didn't know what was in the will. Philippe told me I was safe if he died. I refused to think about it. I was happy with him. It was enough. If I'd left with another man, I wouldn't have asked him for a dime! I'd only have taken that suitcase. No jewels. Yet the suitcase I seized contained the jewels. I can get information from that Swedish girl. I thought it could be of interest to the judge. That's very honourable. Before my incident, I got along with the police. I'd tell them some things, and they'd let me work. How can I thank you? My judge thinks I'm a whore. That's not true. Maybe if you spoke to him... What's the charge? A difficult customer. My friend punished him. He died. You didn't take his money by any chance? Thank you, Miss. Judge Corbier. I wish to speak with the warden. That Gisèle Polmi is a charming nature. Hello, Sir? Could you have Gisèle Polmi change cells? Yes. Put her with Catherine Dumais, a nice girl, or as close as you can get among your inmates. HASTINGS: INTERNATIONAL WARRANT DUMAIS CASE BECOMES HASTINGS CASE I spent Sunday, on the eve of the crime, on the golf course. I'd met up with Mr. Dumais on the green. Mrs. Dumais was ahead of us. She wanted to reach the club house alone. She was meeting someone. That someone was Tom Hastings. I didn't know he'd come. I was surprised to see him. Why had he come? He wanted to confront Philippe in my presence. Mr. Dumais, would you agree to speak with me? Let me catch up with my wife. I'm as hungry as a horse. I felt Mrs. Dumais was wrapping things up because I was there, and I was a bother. LOVERS FROM HELL PLOT PERFECT CRIME WILL KILLER FROM NICE BE PROTECTED BY BRITISH POLICE? A MURDERER! Your case is causing us a lot of trouble. The English want us to hand over Hastings. They resent how the press has presented him, which I can understand, in a way. Our journalists are terrible. Since England dismissed its executioners, they fear he could face the death penalty here. They suggested that our Minister of Justice renounce the international warrant. Instead, they will judge Hastings if there are sufficient charges. He's said to be the son of some official who was quite popular. That counts. All this fuss about the most authentic culprit I've ever seen in my time. Oh! By the way, your dossier was extremely clear. Congratulations. Regarding Tom Hastings, I'm sure of it. Meaning? I'm not certain Mrs. Dumais is his accomplice. Materially speaking. We have evidence against her. I locked her up. But I'm not glad. - Because she's a woman? - No. She just doesn't behave like a murderer. Please, Suzanne. The facts are plain to see. It's all connected. We're the ones connecting them, sir. And we enjoy it. This is the life! She eats, sleeps. She leaves you alone. Come. It's your lawyer. Tom says he's all right. He's thinking of you. The English say the case won't hold and there's no Ms. Corbier over there. And justice still prevails? Will the judge let me see Mrs. Dumais? I have a few questions. Mere clarifications. She can't really refuse. - Did you find a detective? - He's here. Call Mr. Alberti in. An ex-policeman. Clever, tenacious. In France, witnesses easily get rid of private detectives. But he'll stick it out. It's hard to say that a customer didn't leave the casino at all. The cops would prefer if I said he'd vanished for some time that night. You're no fool. - You can fix that. - Sure. With the cops on my back! I don't know... The English lawyer. Does he know anyone in high circles? I could go up the ladder in London or Brighton. Here, when you're not a wop... Mrs. Sovégo, you were Tom Hastings' maid. when he lived here. Tell us what you saw that day. At 4 p.m. that day, Mrs. Dumais visited Mr. Hastings. I left to go shopping. When I came back, Mrs. Dumais was gone. Go on. The room was mess, the bed was undone. I'd made it that afternoon. There were traces. That morning, Mr. Hastings spoke with your husband and you were, as you said, "infuriated" by this. Strange way to be infuriated. Hours later, you had sex with Tom Hastings. It's true, I was a coward. Then you saw Tom Hastings do something. What was it? I saw him put something away in this drawer. What was it? A gun. A witness who saw the gun. Interesting. On that basis, couldn't we imagine what happened next? On Saturday 1st, Tom asks Catherine to leave with him. He buys two tickets, indicating she probably agreed. She announced this to her husband. "You're free," he says, though we may doubt it, because... on Sunday, Tom tries to talk to Philippe. At the golf course. Mr. Dumais brushes him off, but Tom insists, stopping by the next day at his office to negotiate Catherine's leaving. It makes sense. If she leaves him, Catherine is penniless. Then comes the scene with the ring. For their anniversary, Mr. Dumais took his wife to a jeweller's. Mrs. Dumais chose a diamond, easily negotiable. On Monday, Catherine and Tom meet up. Their scheme has failed. They make love. Did they decide to kill him then? Did Catherine give Tom Philippe's gun? It's possible, since that very night, the maid saw Tom put it away in this drawer. What we do know is that moments later, you asked your husband to go out for dinner and to come pick you up after his meeting. Why? The lovers probably wanted to reproduce the conditions of the first assault. One difference: the gun was not in the glove box, as Mr. Dumais expected. He looked for it in vain. Without the neighbour and the maid to testify, it was the perfect crime. Nearly-perfect. This is the logical conclusion we can draw. Do you have another version? I won't turn it down. Have you ever been in Arab countries? They're packed with storytellers, playing the flute. Thanks to their talent, they captivate the crowds. If only you had a flute. I forgot something. The doctor Philippe Dumais supposedly consulted. Due to doctor-patient confidentiality, he can't say if he saw Mr. Dumais. It's the law. You're the only one to claim your husband was impotent. I recognize nothing. Not even myself. I don't recognize Philippe, nor Tom. I recognize no one. Where were you? Under the bed? In the trashcan? You understood, you guessed it. You know everything. You know I loved Philippe, and slept with Tom. One gave me money, the other gave me pleasure. You stand to the side of God to judge men. Are you God himself? No! You're just a cop! I loved like you never will. I was happy. So was Philippe. Even if it bothers you. I've known love, and I still do. Think whatever you like, I don't care! How did it go? You should get some sleep. Jail is a good place to rest. Look at me, I feel better each time. Right... Yes, come in. Headlines: "Shocking." "Justice." You get the picture. It's about us. You and I. They state our names. In England you fire journalists for not stating full names. Why not give our phone numbers? Listen here. "If England is to remain in the common market, "we ask France "not to run a persecutory justice." We're the persecutors. Maybe the truth lies in here. Another truth. Sylvain Maller and his cousin Marc were arrested for burglary. Marc is a talented guitarist. Two days ago, he accused himself of Dumais' murder. He gave details. I asked for his transfer. Sylvain was the instigator and a witness. - Aren't you hungry? - My stomach is in a knot. What about lunch? Here. Thanks. What's this? That's it? It's all we have for today. Don't choke on it. Stop complaining. If it was up to me, I'd let you starve. Fucking bastards. I wonder why you confessed. You'll see. If Marc and Sylvain stick to it, Hastings is innocent, Catherine Dumais didn't lie. She's free to go. You look happy about it. Why not? Because I was too hard on Mrs. Dumais? I'd prefer if she was innocent. Believe me. I don't know why, but I'd prefer. Louise, they found the killer! It was a gypsy: Marc Maller. How about that... Drop your guns. - Come on. - Let's go! Let's go, or I'll kill them! You too. No. Marc didn't kill Mr. Dumais. Nor did Sylvain, naturally. He accused himself to escape. Fine result. They're both dead. Plus a cop. Can you prove Marc Maller didn't kill him? Of course. He was in Arles that day, at a music festival. It's a solid alibi. 2,000 people can testify to Sylvain Maller's presence. Hastings is once again the main suspect. They say you're the most powerful person in France. You can sign a piece of paper and send anyone to jail. Not always. Hastings never went to jail. - Why come to the trial? - Hastings avoids me. Is he more collaborative in his own country? And why are you in London? To see Hastings' acquittal and prepare my client's. Is it thanks to you the matter started? Yes. You saw a man. Look at Mr. Hastings. Is he the man? I can't say. I saw a man, that's all. You said Mr. Dumais was shot with his own gun. Yes. Have you ever handled this weapon? No. You never fired it in order to compare? Obviously not. Would your conviction be easier to justify if you had the gun? It'd be better. All day long, Sir Geoffrey, Hastings' lawyer, scored points. He kept the discussion on purely material elements. He is sure to win the trial, as here, concrete facts are preferred to psychological ideas. Only facts matter. Not presumptions. If Sir Geoffrey can instil reasonable doubt, as the English say, he wins. In Brussels... How many cars damaged in accidents do you get in each day? How many garages are there in the Nice area? 500 cars a day may be in the condition Mr. Hastings' car is in. How many roughcast walls are there in the Nice area? Tens of thousands, probably? Is it then possible to say that one of the 500 cars damaged April 3rd scratched one wall in particular out of all the tens of thousands of walls? Sir Geoffrey is ridiculing the accusation. Witnesses lose their footing. The case built by France can't resist his assaults. You saw Mr. Hastings put a gun into a drawer. Yes. - Did he hold it like that? - Yes. - Did he place it like this? - Yes. Are you sure it was a gun? Yes. What was I holding in my hand? I don't know. - Could it have been a gun? - Yes. There's only one object here. A camera handle bought by Mr. Hastings in Nice. It's a buffoonery. Too bad we can't clown around like that in France. Sir Geoffrey wishes you to depose as a witness. I wished to inform you, out of courtesy. Will you come to the bar? As you like. Mademoiselle... Did you state: "I have psychological charges "against Hastings and Dumais." Did you say Mr. Hastings had been involved in a drug case? Did you state Mrs. Dumais had been a hostess? We judge people, not shadows. Did you find out at what time the lovers made love? If they left traces in the bed? Such facts may be important when the victim is a cumbersome husband. Is that what you call psychological proof? Presumptions. Did the French papers print the witnesses' depositions? Some of them, yes. Who gave them that information? I didn't. Then who? Any courthouse has its leaks. Is there not a danger the jury may be influenced by the press? Despite the press, defendants are acquitted. Do you think Mrs. Dumais will? She could be. And if she is acquitted, she'll have spent months in jail for nothing. It's true. I've heard in England, innocents had spent their lives in jail for nothing. Your colleague is right, but I'm glad I put him in his place. After deliberating, the jury gave its verdict. Not guilty. Consequently, Tom Hastings is acquitted. Acquitted! He's acquitted! He's acquitted! Say... I can't wait to see Corbier's face. You see, sir, what I am aiming at. I won't transfer Catherine Dumais' dossier, as I plan to dismiss the case. Why? If Hastings is guilty, as you believe, so is Mrs. Dumais. The English made a mistake in acquitting him. The public will never accept that we do the same. If you do so, I'll file an appeal. It's your right. You're causing a lot of trouble, Suzanne. Why are you taking this to heart? I'm worried about you. Yes. I am. You'll lose this battle and Mrs. Dumais will bear the blow. I like you, Suzanne. You care about justice, but don't go overboard. Think about it. Attorney General, sir? Suzanne Corbier. I've dismissed the case on Mrs. Dumais. It's dully noted. I'll file an appeal. The court of appeal will decide. ... therefore states that the case of Dumais, Catherine must be referenced to the Alpes-Maritimes court to be ruled. This case, my fellow jurors, comes to us in a peculiar light. Try to forget that a foreign justice system already ruled on it. You are not to take this ruling into account. I disagree. The jury cannot ignore Tom Hastings' acquittal. Must I remind you the jury knows only one rule: their own conviction? Can the clerk read the charges brought before the court? We are stunned by the composure you showed. Waiting for Mr. Dumais, moments before the crime, you were absolutely calm. Your maid said so. Given what was to unfold... I didn't know. Here's a piece of advice. Change your defence. Confess. The jury might understand. More than they do now, anyway. I can positively affirm that Mr. Dumais was shot with his own gun. In London, I was told I couldn't be sure because I hadn't held the gun. It's a theoretical doubt. I saw Mr. Hastings place a gun in the drawer. Are you sure? Yes. A gun. Nothing else. I'm certain. Not a camera handle. After the trial, it came back to me. Mr. Hastings' belongings were already packed, including the camera. Mr. President, with the court and the defence's permission, I'd like to take the opportunity to question a member of the public here today. When you fled to England, what were you afraid of? Of being arrested. Without being guilty? Yes. I wasn't guilty, but suspected. Reasonably so, as I shall prove. Fleeing the justice is not how an innocent acts. The judge won't listen. His judgment is all ready formed. She cheated, she's guilty. But the jury! They deliberate with the judges. Since London, the witnesses have honed their arguments. You're lucky you were judged first. Yes. I asked to depose again. I am the sole culprit. I killed Mr. Dumais. Catherine didn't know. Silence. Go on. I love Catherine. I couldn't leave France without her. She stayed with him out of pity. So I thought I should speak with Mr. Dumais. I don't see your point. Catherine knows she's free. You misunderstand. It's not that. You must tell her to leave. - With you, naturally. - With me. When a woman lives with one man and sleeps with another she starts to think it's not normal. We need to talk about it. The three of us. With Catherine, tonight. Hastings... can you guess why I didn't throw you out? I was curious what an English uncouth was like. Then I wondered: am I wrong not to abandon Catherine? Now I know. I'm saving her from danger. No need to be rude. Let's ask her together. - She won't like it. - Ask her! Did she agree that you would come to see me? You lost, Mr. Hastings. One day, you will too. You're afraid of facing her with me. Here's some advice. Go to London. Keep your illusions. You're bound to lose them otherwise. We're too old to fight this out. Don't you agree? Now I know what a French sap is like. So neither of us has wasted his time. I hated him... Despised him. But I didn't think I'd kill him. The day before I left, Catherine came to see me one last time. In her husband's car. I thought hers was in the shop. I asked her to drive me downtown. On the way, she stopped at the salon to make an appointment. Without thinking, I opened the glove box. I saw the gun. Then it came to me like a flash: if Philippe vanished, she'd come with me. I took the gun. You know the rest. Is that all? Do you wish to make a statement? This trial cannot be pursued. Investigation must resume. Why? We can pursue, since all the protagonists are present. I am not surprised by Mr. Hastings' statement. It confirms what I've believed for some time. Madam, if you recognized Mr. Hastings, which we now know, why mention two attackers? Because... I advise her not to answer. My colleague wants to prey on the court's emotion. I repeat: this trial must be suspended. Please file your pleading. After many confessions and statements, the court left to deliberate. Join us for the next newsflash. In response to the defence's pleading, given the presence of the defendant and the witness, Mr. Hastings, the jury has all the elements necessary to form their judgment. They reject the call for additional investigation. The trial is resumed. During your deliberation, a witness has come forth wishing to make a statement. Her name will surprise you. I remind the court of your reserve power. You may depose. Ladies and gentlemen, my case was the basis for this accusation. I built that case, - yes, I "built" it - on Catherine Dumais' sole lie. That lie impressed me at first. It clarified all the rest. And all the facts fell into place, miraculously. The story with the gun encouraged me. I just needed the human explanation. I looked for it. But I simplified it. She lied, so she's guilty. She's cheating, so she no longer loves her husband. She's poor if she divorces, so she kills him with her lover. When I started to have doubts, it was too late. The wheels were in motion. Everyone thought I was right. I wanted to back down. And I saw Catherine Dumais... for what she really is. A victim. Please. No, no. A victim, I say. The truth of this matter is that Catherine Dumais loved her husband. She didn't want to kill him or leave him. I would have seen it. had I not been blinded by professional habits. Yet something was missing. Now you have it. Tom Hastings' confession. Had he confessed to me I'd have believed it. I'd have freed Mrs. Dumais. So should you. Unbelievable! You can't tell the jury what to do! Sir, any questions for the witness? Absolutely. Did you affirm in London that the English justice system could make judicial errors? Yes. Are you trying to make a French court commit the same error? That was not what I meant. You already know Tom Hastings risks nothing in France after his confession. His case was ruled. Can you not consider he may be trying to help his accomplice avoid punishment like he avoided it himself? It's a hypothesis. I embrace it. So will the jury. It's a nice trap you're falling into. Unwillingly. Are you losing your calm, sir? I could say the same. You lost your calm when, fallen prey to your emotions, you only considered your impressions and intuitions. But I wish to thank you. It is thanks to your dossier that Catherine Dumais will be condemned. You're not listening, Catherine. Everything will be all right. Suzanne Corbier's testimony is vital. If not for the judges, at least for the jury. She said: "Catherine Dumais lied, "so I believed she was guilty." She's right. I lied to everyone. To Tom. To Philippe. To myself. Everything happened because of me. He died because of me. No one can change that. No one. Let them do whatever they please. It doesn't matter. Listen... Given articles 295, 304, 463, 59 and 60 of the penal code, and the jury's response, the court, after deliberation, sentences Catherine Dumais to five years imprisonment. Two judicial errors for one case... that's a tough record to beat.
